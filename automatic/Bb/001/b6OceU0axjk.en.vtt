00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.630 
all of that figuring out what might be
most<00:02:01.200> interesting<00:02:01.890> to<00:02:02.070> put<00:02:02.280> in<00:02:02.550> the

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
most interesting to put in the

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.940 
most interesting to put in the
encyclopedia<00:02:02.930> was<00:02:03.930> very<00:02:04.440> much<00:02:04.590> the<00:02:04.620> first

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
encyclopedia was very much the first

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.350 
encyclopedia was very much the first
challenge<00:02:05.130> that<00:02:05.490> I<00:02:05.520> encountered<00:02:05.670> the

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
challenge that I encountered the

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.060 
challenge that I encountered the
franchise<00:02:06.720> isn't<00:02:06.990> defined<00:02:07.170> necessarily<00:02:07.920> by<00:02:08.040> a

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:08.070 
franchise isn't defined necessarily by a

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:09.469 
franchise isn't defined necessarily by a
single<00:02:08.369> character<00:02:08.520> it's<00:02:08.940> defined<00:02:09.240> more<00:02:09.450> by

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
single character it's defined more by

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.690 
single character it's defined more by
these<00:02:09.810> institutions<00:02:10.530> so<00:02:11.280> we<00:02:11.370> have<00:02:11.460> the<00:02:11.580> option

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
these institutions so we have the option

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.270 
these institutions so we have the option
of<00:02:12.240> moving<00:02:12.720> in<00:02:13.140> and<00:02:13.290> out<00:02:13.380> of<00:02:13.710> different

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280 
of moving in and out of different

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:15.590 
of moving in and out of different
historical<00:02:14.850> periods<00:02:14.910> different

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:15.600 
historical periods different

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.470 
historical periods different
geographical<00:02:16.140> locations<00:02:16.250> different

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480 
geographical locations different

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:19.880 
geographical locations different
individual<00:02:18.480> important<00:02:19.170> events<00:02:19.470> throughout

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
individual important events throughout

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:21.710 
individual important events throughout
human<00:02:20.190> history<00:02:20.250> and<00:02:20.730> so<00:02:20.850> we<00:02:21.000> have<00:02:21.150> a<00:02:21.180> wide

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
human history and so we have a wide

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.450 
human history and so we have a wide
variety<00:02:21.930> of<00:02:22.200> options<00:02:22.380> a<00:02:22.800> lot<00:02:22.980> of<00:02:23.130> different

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:23.460 
variety of options a lot of different

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:25.490 
variety of options a lot of different
material<00:02:23.910> that<00:02:24.090> we<00:02:24.180> can<00:02:24.360> mine<00:02:24.540> for<00:02:24.900> ideas<00:02:25.320> and

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
material that we can mine for ideas and

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.830 
material that we can mine for ideas and
stories<00:02:25.680> imagine<00:02:26.520> this<00:02:26.670> project<00:02:27.180> as<00:02:27.330> a<00:02:27.390> huge

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
stories imagine this project as a huge

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.360 
stories imagine this project as a huge
puzzle<00:02:28.110> with<00:02:28.470> thousands<00:02:29.160> of<00:02:29.250> different

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
puzzle with thousands of different

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:31.460 
puzzle with thousands of different
pieces<00:02:29.760> involving<00:02:30.600> a<00:02:30.720> lot<00:02:30.990> of<00:02:31.110> different

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
pieces involving a lot of different

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:33.620 
pieces involving a lot of different
people<00:02:31.590> we<00:02:32.100> have<00:02:32.250> the<00:02:32.490> tools<00:02:32.760> to<00:02:32.880> track<00:02:33.240> all

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.630 
people we have the tools to track all

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:35.990 
people we have the tools to track all
the<00:02:33.960> narrative<00:02:34.740> thread<00:02:35.070> that<00:02:35.340> were<00:02:35.520> creating

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
the narrative thread that were creating

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.360 
the narrative thread that were creating
so<00:02:36.300> we<00:02:36.450> have<00:02:36.570> database<00:02:37.080> we<00:02:37.410> have<00:02:37.530> Bibles<00:02:38.040> we

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
so we have database we have Bibles we

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:41.300 
so we have database we have Bibles we
have<00:02:38.490> some<00:02:38.910> visual<00:02:39.840> guidelines<00:02:40.350> so<00:02:40.860> my<00:02:41.130> main

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
have some visual guidelines so my main

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:43.310 
have some visual guidelines so my main
role<00:02:41.550> is<00:02:41.610> to<00:02:41.760> make<00:02:42.030> sure<00:02:42.210> everything<00:02:43.110> fits

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:43.320 
role is to make sure everything fits

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:45.650 
role is to make sure everything fits
together<00:02:43.740> so<00:02:44.459> what<00:02:44.610> we<00:02:44.730> did<00:02:44.880> was<00:02:44.940> we<00:02:45.120> tried<00:02:45.480> to

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
together so what we did was we tried to

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:47.840 
together so what we did was we tried to
match<00:02:45.840> a<00:02:46.170> specific<00:02:46.440> kinds<00:02:46.980> of<00:02:47.070> content<00:02:47.489> to

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:47.850 
match a specific kinds of content to

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:49.370 
match a specific kinds of content to
writers<00:02:48.150> who<00:02:48.360> mean<00:02:48.540> we<00:02:48.750> knew<00:02:48.900> or<00:02:49.080> figured

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.380 
writers who mean we knew or figured

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:50.870 
writers who mean we knew or figured
would<00:02:49.530> be<00:02:49.620> interested<00:02:50.130> in<00:02:50.250> writing<00:02:50.430> that<00:02:50.550> kind

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:50.880 
would be interested in writing that kind

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:52.760 
would be interested in writing that kind
of<00:02:50.940> stuff<00:02:51.180> some<00:02:51.570> of<00:02:51.690> the<00:02:51.780> biggest<00:02:52.020> expect<00:02:52.560> on

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:52.770 
of stuff some of the biggest expect on

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:56.030 
of stuff some of the biggest expect on
Assassin's<00:02:53.610> Creed<00:02:54.290> actually<00:02:55.290> within<00:02:55.709> the

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
Assassin's Creed actually within the

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:59.300 
Assassin's Creed actually within the
community<00:02:56.489> so<00:02:56.760> when<00:02:57.150> the<00:02:57.300> time<00:02:57.540> came<00:02:58.290> to<00:02:58.709> start

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
community so when the time came to start

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:02.030 
community so when the time came to start
writing<00:02:59.760> the<00:02:59.790> encyclopedia<00:03:00.540> we<00:03:01.260> realized<00:03:01.680> it

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
writing the encyclopedia we realized it

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:05.540 
writing the encyclopedia we realized it
would<00:03:02.280> be<00:03:02.459> a<00:03:02.489> very<00:03:03.180> good<00:03:03.300> to<00:03:03.540> try<00:03:03.720> to<00:03:03.780> seek<00:03:04.550> one

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:05.550 
would be a very good to try to seek one

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:07.400 
would be a very good to try to seek one
writers<00:03:06.030> coming<00:03:06.420> from<00:03:06.750> from<00:03:07.110> the<00:03:07.230> community

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:07.410 
writers coming from from the community

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:09.800 
writers coming from from the community
so<00:03:07.890> I<00:03:07.920> hope<00:03:08.100> up<00:03:08.250> the<00:03:08.370> job<00:03:08.550> writing<00:03:09.420> further

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
so I hope up the job writing further

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:11.810 
so I hope up the job writing further
encyclopedia<00:03:10.440> on<00:03:10.920> the<00:03:10.950> eb<00:03:11.250> workshop<00:03:11.550> website
