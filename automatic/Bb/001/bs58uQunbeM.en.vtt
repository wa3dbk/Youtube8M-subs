 despair fun and blackboard he's not actor 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:14.540
 forgives badly played 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:17.720
 the role whether it be a comic liter and whether it be noise 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:22.880
 or king oh how hard 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:25.370
 how wonderful acting to be in 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:29.930
 this drama where everything is on 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:30.650
 between the beginning and the end of two hours and then 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:34.930
 less 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:39.260
 only a moment my life 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:40.850
 cinema black and white cinema and i love 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:44.990

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:49.460
 old viewer i'm ready to borrow any 

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:52.670
 a place in the cramped ranks of yours but insanely 

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:57.290
 this drama and me on a par with everyone 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:59.390
 also essentially play the role inherited 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:03.440
 to me 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:04.640
 even there is somewhere near the edge of the camera 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:08.810
 get up 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:09.560
 even by not playing, I play a role and 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:13.940
 his 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:17.690
 and participating in the plot I look from the side 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:21.140
 as my moments run and my codes are mine 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:25.010
 sons do not intertwine with others this 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:26.959
 thin thread where I already unfortunately 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:30.080
 nothing can be changed 

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:34.220
 because in this drama be a jester or 

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:38.800
 King twice the role does not play only 1 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:40.530
 play a fraction and own role 

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:42.130
 I'm crying 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:44.630
 I want them 

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:48.620
 what I see with what we see 

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:52.530
 I want to connect in one thing that video with 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:58.150
 that know help to bind in one 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:04:00.569
 my life is my color panorama of her 

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:00.569
 movie 

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:49.230
