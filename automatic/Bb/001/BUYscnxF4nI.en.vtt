what these factors are and how we can

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.720 
what these factors are and how we can

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
this case I'm going to fight a Lupin but

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.459 
this case I'm going to fight a Lupin but
let's<00:00:42.090> say<00:00:42.239> that<00:00:42.390> you<00:00:42.450> had<00:00:42.600> general<00:00:43.050> trouble

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
let's say that you had general trouble

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.920 
let's say that you had general trouble
with<00:00:43.559> the<00:00:43.680> enemy<00:00:44.010> class<00:00:44.250> monstrosity<00:00:45.120> which

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
with the enemy class monstrosity which

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.529 
with the enemy class monstrosity which
would<00:00:46.050> include<00:00:46.399> lupins<00:00:47.399> wretches<00:00:48.000> anything

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
would include lupins wretches anything

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:51.020 
would include lupins wretches anything
of<00:00:48.660> that<00:00:48.690> type<00:00:49.399> if<00:00:50.399> you<00:00:50.489> had<00:00:50.700> trouble<00:00:50.969> with

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
of that type if you had trouble with

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.209 
of that type if you had trouble with
that<00:00:51.239> class<00:00:51.600> because<00:00:52.440> you<00:00:52.710> don't<00:00:52.920> know<00:00:53.010> how<00:00:53.129> to

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
that class because you don't know how to

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:54.799 
that class because you don't know how to
respond<00:00:53.640> you<00:00:53.789> don't<00:00:53.969> know<00:00:54.030> how<00:00:54.120> to<00:00:54.210> dodge<00:00:54.449> you

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
respond you don't know how to dodge you

don't<00:00:54.989> know<00:00:55.050> how<00:00:55.140> to<00:00:55.199> parry<00:00:55.559> their<00:00:55.800> moves<00:00:56.390> then

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
don't know how to parry their moves then

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:58.880 
don't know how to parry their moves then
inevitably<00:00:57.719> you're<00:00:58.140> not<00:00:58.289> going<00:00:58.500> to<00:00:58.590> do<00:00:58.710> well

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
inevitably you're not going to do well

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.060 
inevitably you're not going to do well
in<00:00:59.010> the<00:00:59.100> battle<00:00:59.930> my<00:01:00.930> suggestion<00:01:01.559> to<00:01:01.649> counter

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
in the battle my suggestion to counter

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.950 
in the battle my suggestion to counter
this<00:01:02.250> inability<00:01:02.520> to<00:01:02.879> understand<00:01:03.660> the<00:01:03.719> moves

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
this inability to understand the moves

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.380 
this inability to understand the moves
is<00:01:04.320> number<00:01:04.860> one<00:01:05.040> practice<00:01:05.580> makes<00:01:05.790> perfect

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
is number one practice makes perfect

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.030 
is number one practice makes perfect
I<00:01:06.479> know<00:01:06.810> people<00:01:07.110> don't<00:01:07.350> like<00:01:07.590> generally

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
I know people don't like generally

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.179 
I know people don't like generally
hearing<00:01:08.400> that<00:01:08.580> but<00:01:09.270> it's<00:01:09.930> a<00:01:10.080> fact<00:01:10.350> the<00:01:10.950> more

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
hearing that but it's a fact the more

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:12.590 
hearing that but it's a fact the more
that<00:01:11.340> you<00:01:11.430> practice<00:01:11.580> with<00:01:12.000> a<00:01:12.119> certain<00:01:12.390> class

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
that you practice with a certain class

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:13.280 
that you practice with a certain class
of<00:01:12.750> enemy

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
of enemy

time in the form of skill another way
that<00:01:24.390> you<00:01:24.570> can<00:01:24.780> learn<00:01:24.960> enemy's<00:01:25.439> moves<00:01:25.710> is<00:01:25.979> by

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
that you can learn enemy's moves is by

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.910 
that you can learn enemy's moves is by
watching<00:01:26.729> video<00:01:27.030> tutorials<00:01:27.570> online<00:01:27.780> and<00:01:28.530> I

watching video tutorials online and I

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.679 
watching video tutorials online and I
know<00:01:28.979> that<00:01:29.250> many<00:01:29.430> other<00:01:29.670> IBM<00:01:30.090> members<00:01:30.540> have

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
know that many other IBM members have

done many video tutorials online and I

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.429 
done many video tutorials online and I
can't<00:01:33.000> stress<00:01:33.240> enough<00:01:33.479> how<00:01:33.659> helpful<00:01:34.140> those

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
can't stress enough how helpful those

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:37.069 
can't stress enough how helpful those
are<00:01:34.680> if<00:01:34.920> you<00:01:35.909> watch<00:01:36.119> other<00:01:36.390> people's<00:01:36.689> videos

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
are if you watch other people's videos

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:39.620 
are if you watch other people's videos
you<00:01:37.740> can<00:01:37.920> memorize<00:01:38.130> and<00:01:38.670> enemy's<00:01:38.970> moves<00:01:39.299> and

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
you can memorize and enemy's moves and

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.690 
you can memorize and enemy's moves and
how<00:01:40.110> that<00:01:40.350> person<00:01:40.860> is<00:01:40.979> countering<00:01:41.579> those

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
how that person is countering those

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.760 
how that person is countering those
moves<00:01:42.000> so<00:01:42.390> you<00:01:42.540> can<00:01:42.689> apply<00:01:42.960> that<00:01:43.170> to<00:01:43.530> your<00:01:43.590> own

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
moves so you can apply that to your own

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.800 
moves so you can apply that to your own
battle<00:01:44.220> those<00:01:45.090> would<00:01:45.270> be<00:01:45.390> my<00:01:45.540> primary

battle those would be my primary

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.539 
battle those would be my primary
suggestions<00:01:46.560> for<00:01:46.770> how<00:01:46.799> you<00:01:46.950> would<00:01:47.070> counter

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
suggestions for how you would counter

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:51.679 
suggestions for how you would counter
and<00:01:47.729> enemy's<00:01:48.030> moves<00:01:49.909> here<00:01:50.909> you<00:01:51.149> can<00:01:51.329> see<00:01:51.540> that

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
and enemy's moves here you can see that

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:54.440 
and enemy's moves here you can see that
I'm<00:01:51.780> battling<00:01:52.170> RIF<00:01:52.649> and<00:01:52.979> RIF<00:01:53.670> is<00:01:53.909> said<00:01:54.119> to<00:01:54.270> be

I'm battling RIF and RIF is said to be

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.289 
I'm battling RIF and RIF is said to be
the<00:01:55.100> epitome<00:01:56.100> of<00:01:56.130> the<00:01:56.369> hardest<00:01:56.969> enemy

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
the epitome of the hardest enemy

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:00.160 
the epitome of the hardest enemy
infinitely<00:01:57.869> -<00:01:58.229> by<00:01:58.680> many<00:01:59.159> beginning<00:01:59.610> players

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:00.170 
infinitely - by many beginning players

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:01.760 
infinitely - by many beginning players
why<00:02:01.170> is<00:02:01.229> that

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
why is that

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.609 
why is that
well<00:02:02.280> it's<00:02:02.670> rich<00:02:02.909> strength<00:02:03.360> and<00:02:03.600> RIF<00:02:03.780> self<00:02:04.200> but

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
well it's rich strength and RIF self but

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.530 
well it's rich strength and RIF self but
primarily<00:02:04.860> with<00:02:05.310> self<00:02:05.610> because<00:02:05.969> you<00:02:06.149> can<00:02:06.299> see

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
primarily with self because you can see

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.869 
primarily with self because you can see
as<00:02:06.750> you're<00:02:07.229> fighting<00:02:07.619> him<00:02:07.649> the<00:02:08.250> number<00:02:08.670> there

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
as you're fighting him the number there

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:11.089 
as you're fighting him the number there
to<00:02:09.450> the<00:02:09.539> right<00:02:09.750> of<00:02:10.020> his<00:02:10.229> health<00:02:10.470> bar<00:02:10.679> is<00:02:10.920> just

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
to the right of his health bar is just

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:13.890 
to the right of his health bar is just
daunting<00:02:11.940> it's<00:02:12.390> amazing<00:02:12.959> how<00:02:13.050> much<00:02:13.170> health

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
daunting it's amazing how much health

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.600 
daunting it's amazing how much health
so<00:02:14.900> this<00:02:15.019> brings<00:02:15.170> me<00:02:15.379> to<00:02:15.470> my<00:02:15.650> second<00:02:16.430> most

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610 
so this brings me to my second most

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:18.430 
so this brings me to my second most
common<00:02:17.300> problem<00:02:17.720> in<00:02:17.810> returning<00:02:18.200> the<00:02:18.260> blade

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:18.440 
common problem in returning the blade

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:20.470 
common problem in returning the blade
with<00:02:18.620> the<00:02:18.769> enemy<00:02:19.340> battles<00:02:19.700> and<00:02:19.879> that<00:02:20.299> is

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 
with the enemy battles and that is

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.539 
with the enemy battles and that is
health<00:02:20.870> when<00:02:21.470> an<00:02:21.590> enemy<00:02:21.860> has<00:02:22.010> a<00:02:22.040> lot<00:02:22.280> of<00:02:22.310> health

00:02:22.539 --> 00:02:22.549 
health when an enemy has a lot of health

00:02:22.549 --> 00:02:24.640 
health when an enemy has a lot of health
it<00:02:22.790> intimidates<00:02:23.299> a<00:02:23.450> player<00:02:23.720> but<00:02:24.470> let's

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:24.650 
it intimidates a player but let's

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:26.320 
it intimidates a player but let's
remember<00:02:24.890> the<00:02:25.159> health<00:02:25.430> does<00:02:25.790> not<00:02:25.819> equate<00:02:26.269> to

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:26.330 
remember the health does not equate to

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:30.699 
remember the health does not equate to
skill<00:02:27.640> oftentimes<00:02:28.840> tip<00:02:29.840> number<00:02:30.019> one<00:02:30.379> can<00:02:30.590> be

00:02:30.699 --> 00:02:30.709 
skill oftentimes tip number one can be

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:32.860 
skill oftentimes tip number one can be
applied<00:02:31.010> to<00:02:31.040> this<00:02:31.400> tip<00:02:31.670> as<00:02:31.849> well<00:02:32.120> and<00:02:32.420> that's

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:32.870 
applied to this tip as well and that's

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:35.860 
applied to this tip as well and that's
just<00:02:33.080> knowing<00:02:33.470> an<00:02:33.560> enemy's<00:02:33.920> moves<00:02:34.610> because<00:02:35.420> if

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:35.870 
just knowing an enemy's moves because if

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:38.440 
just knowing an enemy's moves because if
you<00:02:35.989> know<00:02:36.230> wrist<00:02:36.620> moves<00:02:37.040> then<00:02:37.640> his<00:02:37.879> health<00:02:38.180> is

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:38.450 
you know wrist moves then his health is

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:40.900 
you know wrist moves then his health is
not<00:02:38.480> so<00:02:38.690> important<00:02:39.500> it<00:02:39.620> just<00:02:40.129> sustains<00:02:40.700> the

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:40.910 
not so important it just sustains the

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:42.460 
not so important it just sustains the
battle<00:02:41.209> for<00:02:41.360> a<00:02:41.420> little<00:02:41.660> bit<00:02:41.750> longer<00:02:42.019> but

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:42.470 
battle for a little bit longer but

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:43.899 
battle for a little bit longer but
you're<00:02:42.620> not<00:02:42.739> fighting<00:02:42.980> the<00:02:43.310> heart<00:02:43.640> of<00:02:43.819> an

00:02:43.899 --> 00:02:43.909 
you're not fighting the heart of an

00:02:43.909 --> 00:02:46.720 
you're not fighting the heart of an
enemy<00:02:44.269> it's<00:02:44.840> like<00:02:45.110> if<00:02:45.230> you<00:02:45.349> change<00:02:45.709> say<00:02:46.190> an<00:02:46.370> MX

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:46.730 
enemy it's like if you change say an MX

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:49.809 
enemy it's like if you change say an MX
defenders<00:02:47.510> health<00:02:47.959> to<00:02:48.590> be<00:02:48.769> three<00:02:49.310> times<00:02:49.579> the

00:02:49.809 --> 00:02:49.819 
defenders health to be three times the

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:51.789 
defenders health to be three times the
link<00:02:50.060> that<00:02:50.510> doesn't<00:02:50.629> make<00:02:50.870> them<00:02:50.989> extender<00:02:51.650> any

00:02:51.789 --> 00:02:51.799 
link that doesn't make them extender any

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:53.440 
link that doesn't make them extender any
more<00:02:52.040> difficult<00:02:52.579> it<00:02:52.670> just<00:02:52.700> makes<00:02:53.000> the<00:02:53.150> battle

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:53.450 
more difficult it just makes the battle

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:56.080 
more difficult it just makes the battle
a<00:02:53.510> little<00:02:53.720> bit<00:02:53.840> longer<00:02:54.049> so<00:02:54.379> try<00:02:55.310> to<00:02:55.370> apply<00:02:55.790> an

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:56.090 
a little bit longer so try to apply an

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:58.030 
a little bit longer so try to apply an
enemy's<00:02:56.480> moves<00:02:56.810> and<00:02:57.140> tips<00:02:57.349> for<00:02:57.590> that<00:02:57.739> and

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.040 
enemy's moves and tips for that and

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:01.000 
enemy's moves and tips for that and
videos<00:02:58.700> for<00:02:59.000> that<00:02:59.060> too<00:02:59.180> the<00:03:00.079> battle<00:03:00.440> and<00:03:00.590> then

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.010 
videos for that too the battle and then

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:02.589 
videos for that too the battle and then
you'll<00:03:01.160> have<00:03:01.280> less<00:03:01.579> of<00:03:01.730> a<00:03:01.819> struggle<00:03:02.209> with<00:03:02.239> the

00:03:02.589 --> 00:03:02.599 
you'll have less of a struggle with the

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:07.059 
you'll have less of a struggle with the
actual<00:03:02.900> health<00:03:05.079> of<00:03:06.079> course<00:03:06.379> if<00:03:06.620> one<00:03:06.799> of<00:03:06.920> your

00:03:07.059 --> 00:03:07.069 
actual health of course if one of your

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:09.220 
actual health of course if one of your
major<00:03:07.310> concerns<00:03:07.940> is<00:03:08.209> how<00:03:08.390> long<00:03:08.629> a<00:03:08.660> battle<00:03:09.079> is

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:09.230 
major concerns is how long a battle is

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:11.349 
major concerns is how long a battle is
because<00:03:09.530> you<00:03:09.680> fear<00:03:10.010> messing<00:03:10.670> up<00:03:10.819> during<00:03:11.150> the

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:11.359 
because you fear messing up during the

00:03:11.359 --> 00:03:13.420 
because you fear messing up during the
battle<00:03:11.690> then<00:03:12.200> one<00:03:12.440> obvious<00:03:12.920> way<00:03:13.069> to<00:03:13.129> correct

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:13.430 
battle then one obvious way to correct

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:15.400 
battle then one obvious way to correct
the<00:03:13.579> length<00:03:13.819> of<00:03:14.000> the<00:03:14.090> battle<00:03:14.420> is<00:03:14.540> to<00:03:14.870> shorten

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:15.410 
the length of the battle is to shorten

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:17.979 
the length of the battle is to shorten
it<00:03:15.530> by<00:03:15.590> having<00:03:16.069> more<00:03:16.250> attack<00:03:16.609> and<00:03:16.970> that<00:03:17.690> means

00:03:17.979 --> 00:03:17.989 
it by having more attack and that means

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:20.319 
it by having more attack and that means
taking<00:03:18.470> things<00:03:18.650> out<00:03:18.829> of<00:03:19.010> health<00:03:19.250> out<00:03:19.669> of<00:03:19.849> magic

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:20.329 
taking things out of health out of magic

00:03:20.329 --> 00:03:22.390 
taking things out of health out of magic
as<00:03:20.510> a<00:03:20.540> shield<00:03:20.959> whatever<00:03:21.470> use<00:03:21.739> the<00:03:21.950> least<00:03:22.160> and

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:22.400 
as a shield whatever use the least and

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:25.420 
as a shield whatever use the least and
applying<00:03:23.060> it<00:03:23.209> to<00:03:23.269> attack<00:03:23.889> because<00:03:24.889> obviously

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:25.430 
applying it to attack because obviously

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:27.430 
applying it to attack because obviously
the<00:03:25.700> more<00:03:25.849> attack<00:03:26.120> you<00:03:26.299> have<00:03:26.480> the<00:03:26.930> faster

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:27.440 
the more attack you have the faster

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:32.110 
the more attack you have the faster
it'll<00:03:27.590> drain<00:03:27.889> your<00:03:28.069> enemy's<00:03:28.430> health<00:03:28.669> bar<00:03:31.120> some

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:32.120 
it'll drain your enemy's health bar some

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:33.729 
it'll drain your enemy's health bar some
people<00:03:32.419> are<00:03:32.510> completely<00:03:32.870> comfortable<00:03:33.319> with

00:03:33.729 --> 00:03:33.739 
people are completely comfortable with

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:35.620 
people are completely comfortable with
all<00:03:34.130> of<00:03:34.280> an<00:03:34.370> enemy's<00:03:34.700> health<00:03:35.000> and<00:03:35.269> all<00:03:35.389> of<00:03:35.540> the

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:35.630 
all of an enemy's health and all of the

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:37.539 
all of an enemy's health and all of the
enemy's<00:03:35.959> moves<00:03:36.290> but<00:03:36.889> the<00:03:36.950> problem<00:03:37.400> is

00:03:37.539 --> 00:03:37.549 
enemy's moves but the problem is

00:03:37.549 --> 00:03:39.250 
enemy's moves but the problem is
sometimes<00:03:37.940> they<00:03:38.329> just<00:03:38.480> do<00:03:38.630> it<00:03:38.720> a<00:03:38.780> little<00:03:38.989> too

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:39.260 
sometimes they just do it a little too

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.770 
sometimes they just do it a little too
quickly<00:03:39.290> a<00:03:39.980> common<00:03:40.819> example<00:03:40.940> of<00:03:41.329> this<00:03:41.540> or

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:48.500 
who all have certain combinations and

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:50.199 
who all have certain combinations and
moves<00:03:48.680> that<00:03:48.919> happen<00:03:49.190> occasionally<00:03:49.519> and<00:03:50.090> make

00:03:50.199 --> 00:03:50.209 
moves that happen occasionally and make

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:52.030 
moves that happen occasionally and make
it<00:03:50.359> hard<00:03:50.630> for<00:03:50.720> the<00:03:50.930> player<00:03:51.200> to<00:03:51.470> Parry<00:03:51.799> and

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:52.040 
it hard for the player to Parry and

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:55.059 
it hard for the player to Parry and
dodge<00:03:52.130> them<00:03:52.880> with<00:03:53.030> the<00:03:53.090> proper<00:03:53.480> timing<00:03:54.069> again

oftentimes<00:03:55.549> this<00:03:55.910> just<00:03:56.180> comes<00:03:56.389> down<00:03:56.510> to

00:03:56.619 --> 00:03:56.629 
oftentimes this just comes down to

00:03:56.629 --> 00:03:58.990 
oftentimes this just comes down to
practice<00:03:57.260> but<00:03:57.799> there<00:03:58.310> are<00:03:58.489> different<00:03:58.819> types

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:50.910 
all attack or low health is to reduce

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:52.280 
all attack or low health is to reduce
the<00:04:51.120> amount<00:04:51.270> of<00:04:51.390> health<00:04:51.570> that<00:04:51.750> you<00:04:51.870> have<00:04:52.020> and

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:54.660 
apply it to attack not only will this

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:56.060 
apply it to attack not only will this
help<00:04:54.840> with<00:04:55.020> the<00:04:55.110> other<00:04:55.290> areas<00:04:55.800> that<00:04:55.920> we're

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:56.070 
help with the other areas that we're

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:58.100 
help with the other areas that we're
having<00:04:56.340> trouble<00:04:56.670> with<00:04:56.700> but<00:04:57.450> it<00:04:57.720> will<00:04:57.810> also

00:04:58.100 --> 00:04:58.110 
having trouble with but it will also

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:01.070 
having trouble with but it will also
force<00:04:58.560> you<00:04:58.740> to<00:04:58.770> take<00:04:59.670> less<00:04:59.880> damage<00:05:00.080> because

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:01.080 
force you to take less damage because

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:02.870 
force you to take less damage because
ultimately<00:05:01.710> if<00:05:02.010> you<00:05:02.310> take<00:05:02.610> less<00:05:02.850> damage

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:02.880 
ultimately if you take less damage

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:05.150 
ultimately if you take less damage
because<00:05:03.570> you<00:05:03.690> have<00:05:03.810> less<00:05:03.990> health<00:05:04.260> then<00:05:04.740> you'll

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:05.160 
because you have less health then you'll

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:07.250 
because you have less health then you'll
die<00:05:05.370> less<00:05:05.580> frequently<00:05:06.060> so<00:05:06.930> that's<00:05:07.080> my

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:07.260 
die less frequently so that's my

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:09.560 
die less frequently so that's my

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:11.640 
there it's practice I know sometimes it

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:13.160 
there it's practice I know sometimes it
can<00:05:11.670> become<00:05:11.970> extremely<00:05:12.510> annoying<00:05:12.900> when<00:05:13.080> you

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:13.170 
can become extremely annoying when you

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:15.590 
can become extremely annoying when you
have<00:05:13.320> less<00:05:13.590> health<00:05:13.830> or<00:05:14.130> zero<00:05:14.910> health<00:05:15.240> at<00:05:15.450> all

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:18.450 
and you die a lot more frequently but

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:19.940 
and you die a lot more frequently but
after<00:05:18.900> you've<00:05:19.050> done<00:05:19.200> it<00:05:19.260> for<00:05:19.380> a<00:05:19.560> while
