you<00:03:13.659> can<00:03:13.870> kind<00:03:14.079> of<00:03:14.199> make<00:03:14.319> a<00:03:14.379> tool<00:03:14.680> and<00:03:14.889> work

00:03:15.539 --> 00:03:15.549 
you can kind of make a tool and work

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:17.309 
you can kind of make a tool and work
work<00:03:16.239> with<00:03:16.449> it<00:03:16.629> but<00:03:16.719> like<00:03:16.840> it<00:03:16.959> says<00:03:17.079> you<00:03:17.199> buy

00:03:17.309 --> 00:03:17.319 
work with it but like it says you buy

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:19.920 
work with it but like it says you buy
the<00:03:17.379> low<00:03:17.590> C<00:03:17.799> tool<00:03:18.010> you'll<00:03:18.760> be<00:03:18.879> ever<00:03:19.060> to<00:03:19.389> really

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:19.930 
the low C tool you'll be ever to really

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:21.089 
the low C tool you'll be ever to really
adjust<00:03:20.019> that<00:03:20.379> so<00:03:20.560> we're<00:03:20.680> gonna<00:03:20.769> do<00:03:20.919> now<00:03:21.069> is

00:03:21.089 --> 00:03:21.099 
adjust that so we're gonna do now is

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:23.250 
adjust that so we're gonna do now is
pretty<00:03:21.489> much<00:03:21.579> run<00:03:21.849> her<00:03:22.030> here<00:03:22.299> and<00:03:22.480> it's<00:03:22.870> not

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:23.260 
pretty much run her here and it's not

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:37.010 
pretty much run her here and it's not
really<00:03:23.530> attractive<00:03:24.099> it's<00:03:24.219> a<00:03:24.280> little<00:03:24.489> place<00:03:24.669> I

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:37.020 

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:39.330 

well<00:03:38.020> there<00:03:38.200> we're<00:03:38.380> going<00:03:38.560> right<00:03:38.950> over<00:03:38.980> the

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:39.340

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:50.380 
the way low seat was able to pretty much

00:03:50.380 --> 00:04:07.890 
the way low seat was able to pretty much
build<00:03:50.650> a<00:03:50.740> clock<00:03:51.270> Japanese

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:07.900 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:10.210 

yeah<00:04:08.900> off<00:04:09.140> power<00:04:09.440> you<00:04:09.650> know<00:04:09.770> if<00:04:09.860> you<00:04:09.950> want<00:04:10.130> to

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:10.220 
yeah off power you know if you want to

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:11.860 
yeah off power you know if you want to
really<00:04:10.400> get<00:04:10.550> the<00:04:10.670> thing<00:04:10.850> to<00:04:10.940> spin<00:04:11.180> around<00:04:11.300> take

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:11.870 
really get the thing to spin around take

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:13.660 
really get the thing to spin around take
you<00:04:12.230> know<00:04:12.350> apply<00:04:12.770> a<00:04:12.800> little<00:04:13.010> bit<00:04:13.160> of<00:04:13.250> brake<00:04:13.460> in

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:13.670 
you know apply a little bit of brake in

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:15.100 
you know apply a little bit of brake in
that<00:04:13.970> front<00:04:14.210> end<00:04:14.360> I'll<00:04:14.510> just<00:04:14.660> slip<00:04:14.930> right

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:15.110 
that front end I'll just slip right

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:18.400 
that front end I'll just slip right
around<00:04:15.410> it<00:04:16.250> doesn't<00:04:16.459> push<00:04:16.760> too<00:04:16.970> much<00:04:17.230> in<00:04:18.230> the

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:18.410 
around it doesn't push too much in the

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:21.789 
around it doesn't push too much in the
corners<00:04:19.930> yeah<00:04:20.930> when<00:04:21.079> you<00:04:21.170> really<00:04:21.470> want<00:04:21.620> to<00:04:21.709> get

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:21.799 
corners yeah when you really want to get

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:23.020 
corners yeah when you really want to get
the<00:04:21.920> thing<00:04:22.100> around<00:04:22.220> you<00:04:22.520> let<00:04:22.760> off<00:04:22.880> the

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:23.030 
the thing around you let off the

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:24.520 
the thing around you let off the
throttle<00:04:23.060> and<00:04:23.450> I<00:04:23.720> mean<00:04:23.900> she'll<00:04:24.140> turn<00:04:24.350> on<00:04:24.500> a

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:24.530 
throttle and I mean she'll turn on a

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:39.770 
throttle and I mean she'll turn on a
dime

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:39.780 

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:41.650 

well<00:04:40.380> do<00:04:40.500> now<00:04:40.680> we'll<00:04:40.890> do<00:04:41.010> a<00:04:41.040> little<00:04:41.280> bit<00:04:41.400> of

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:41.660 
well do now we'll do a little bit of

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:44.930 
well do now we'll do a little bit of
full<00:04:42.660> power<00:04:42.840> runs<00:04:43.260> here<00:04:43.530> let<00:04:43.830> me<00:04:43.860> bring<00:04:44.730> it

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:44.940 
full power runs here let me bring it

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:49.520 
full power runs here let me bring it
around<00:04:47.180> bring<00:04:48.180> around<00:04:48.270> counterclockwise<00:04:48.870> in

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:49.530 
around bring around counterclockwise in

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:53.150 
around bring around counterclockwise in
probably<00:04:50.010> punch<00:04:50.370> it<00:04:50.610> oh<00:04:51.830> that's<00:04:52.830> full

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:53.160 
probably punch it oh that's full

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:54.410 
probably punch it oh that's full
throttle<00:04:53.580> I'll<00:04:53.760> do<00:04:53.880> it

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:54.420 
throttle I'll do it

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:56.150 
throttle I'll do it
a<00:04:54.450> little<00:04:54.870> bit<00:04:54.990> smoother<00:04:55.410> terrain<00:04:55.740> over<00:04:55.770> here

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:56.160 
a little bit smoother terrain over here

00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:06.540 
a little bit smoother terrain over here
let<00:04:56.340> me<00:04:59.750> get<00:05:00.750> it<00:05:00.930> straight<00:05:01.110> now

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:06.550 

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:08.850 

there<00:05:07.300> we<00:05:07.390> go<00:05:07.510> that's<00:05:07.990> full<00:05:08.350> power<00:05:08.560> they're

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:08.860 
there we go that's full power they're

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:12.090 
there we go that's full power they're
probably<00:05:09.670> talking<00:05:09.910> now<00:05:10.210> about<00:05:10.240> 25<00:05:11.140> maybe<00:05:11.740> 30

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:12.100 
probably talking now about 25 maybe 30
