00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.330
 hello in this video I want you 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:08.069
 show how to use your android device 

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:10.139
 nintendo ds plays games and goes 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:11.639
 it's just that you have to do it for me 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:14.190
 do not pay attention to many steps 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:15.719
 I'll show you just like that 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.119
 works and you have to 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:21.180
 once download an emulator and 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:26.130
 i would give you this emulator here 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:27.480
 recommend nds progress is the and 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.640
 the advantage here is that is 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:33.079
 free and yes with the others 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:35.520
 Emulators are always relatively slow 

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:37.860
 and then you go out for money and 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.960
 then the gates are slow of 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.489
 therefore, I would rather recommend yourself in 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.960
 get free and if it always 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.670
 At least you are not very slow yet 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.460
 money spent because it really lies 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.950
 on the device older phones with worse 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.420
 hardware where you still have to 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:55.020
 be pretty slow but if you are 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:56.730
 now such new high end smartphones 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:59.820
 it should already be liquid 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:02.039
 run because the emulators also in 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:05.100
 have pretty much improved recently 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:07.229
 we can show once if 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:10.650
 you would open the emulator now 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:12.600
 after downloading is first 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:16.939
 just such a yes so a file explorer 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:19.080
 so where are the whole here? 

00:01:16.939 --> 00:01:23.100
 different folders of a green one 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:25.470
 yes, that just does not help 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:28.020
 Of course you would have to come from somewhere now 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.710
 download the game to it then 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.009
 to open 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.630
 I 've already done that 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:36.570
 For example, show you a page where 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:40.020
 you can do that well and that is 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:43.229
 this cool space point com michael 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:45.240
 space without it and there you only have to 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:48.060
 take care that we have a desktop 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.979
 version is because I'm just wanted there 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.240
 what to download in the mobile version 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:53.729
 or somehow it was not like that for me 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:56.820
 worked out but here I am now 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:02:00.299
 gone under co.com and then under 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:01.409
 room to the nintendo ds france the 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:05.040
 I think you also find yourself 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:09.149
 and now there are quite a few here 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:11.580
 nintendo ds games to choose from you can 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:13.310
 select now and get that down 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:16.190
 loaded what I understand 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:17.000
 a pokémon heartgold soulsilver awesome 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:20.450
 mario bros 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.400
 Mario kart so what I have now 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:25.819
 already for example only the first one 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:27.170
 downloaded pokémon diamond and that 

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:28.099
 it's called there in mine now 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:30.019
 download fulda 

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:33.489
 So if you are always looking for something 

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:37.220
 download is of course in the download 

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:40.730
 and when he opens this nds now 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:51.730
 he simply talks in the download 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:54.769
 Open fulda moment afterwards 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:56.569
 so now I'm already lucky here 

00:02:54.769 --> 00:03:00.250
 automatic download process 

00:02:56.569 --> 00:03:00.250
 we do not want that at all 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:13.340
 so here 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:16.680
 I went to the wrong folder 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:18.840
 you have here which is now the very 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:22.640
 normal overview of all the folders 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:25.530
 The train has something I know everything 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:27.450
 Android is a normal folder 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:28.650
 of course I could do that 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:31.050
 make in simple folders 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:32.430
 emulator if you play a lot of me 

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:34.140
 Games below just loads a folder 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:35.760
 in the rollator you copy yourself 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:36.990
 all the gimmicks delete team 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:38.700
 download folder and there you have the 

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:40.230
 nice orders he still has 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:41.940
 not made i just show you now 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:45.180
 then you can just once under 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:47.550
 go download and there we have it now 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:48.270
 my downloads and all in the zip 

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:50.190
 or rare 

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:52.500
 in this game the quiet and 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:54.690
 downloads are always in zip or rar 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:56.820
 format and now you can see here between 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:04:02.330
 already pokémon diamond points 

00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:04.680
 if I click on it then it lives 

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:07.470
 and yes that takes moment because the file 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:10.110
 is relatively large and then starts the same 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:11.370
 the game is already here here 

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:17.549
 one also the whole button 

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:19.410
 which one also has on the ds soja moment 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:22.650
 as I said that is still a bit 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:25.800
 slow because the simulators are the ones 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:28.020
 partly not fully developed 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:29.690
 but playing of pokémon example is 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:32.400
 you see it opens 

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:34.430
 you have the upper screen here 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:37.360
 bsd west upper 

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:37.360
 which remains underneath 

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:46.199
 so I can once again hold so 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:50.400
 now, of course, the disadvantage is that 

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:52.320
 I here in lower screen 

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:57.410
 can use because now the whole train 

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:57.410
 What are you always up to? 

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:01.820
 Thus pokemon starts as usual 

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:10.790
 you know it 

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:10.790
 I am so if you know that 

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:19.729
 Yes , we do not have to do that now 

00:05:18.199 --> 00:05:22.850
 play through you know the new pokémon 

00:05:19.729 --> 00:05:26.060
 you all know and you can actually 

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:29.569
 just about every nintendo ds game now 

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:31.370
 play on your smartphone or tablet 

00:05:29.569 --> 00:05:33.169
 like me, it does not matter 

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:36.949
 it just needs I'll say it 

00:05:33.169 --> 00:05:42.590
 briefly download the nds ford im 

00:05:36.949 --> 00:05:43.699
 play stop a supplier site how cool 

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:45.740
 space dot com 

00:05:43.699 --> 00:05:47.979
 invites you the thumbs down looks where he 

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:51.470
 you have the best of the folder 

00:05:47.979 --> 00:05:52.940
 called emulator the game or something like that 

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:53.539
 pull the pure to overview 

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:55.970
 to have 

00:05:53.539 --> 00:05:58.190
 and yes, you can always do that when you have the 

00:05:55.970 --> 00:06:00.740
 emulator simply starts in your place there 

00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:01.550
 go in and then open the game 

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:04.099
 he wants to play 

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:06.410
 that's how easy i hope i could 

00:06:04.099 --> 00:06:07.639
 to help you with that one turns 

00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:08.840
 that was always so complicated before 

00:06:07.639 --> 00:06:10.909
 actually it is very easy 

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:15.289
 yes I have I wish you help 

00:06:10.909 --> 00:06:17.270
 have look at times on a channel there have 

00:06:15.289 --> 00:06:19.970
 I still have other videos through in too 

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:20.530
 things android halves and continue to bring 

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:22.820
 can 

00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:26.409
 Yes, I'm looking forward to the next time 

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:26.409
 with you until then bye
