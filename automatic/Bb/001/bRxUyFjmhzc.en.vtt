00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:07.089
 ace my name is mikimix today there is a 

00:00:06.129 --> 00:00:08.410
 support photo 4 

00:00:07.089 --> 00:00:10.000
 but before I start I would like to 

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:11.620
 thank the staff of me I enjoy the weapons 

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.400
 if this video was published on them 

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:13.870
 channel 

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:15.969
 I also want to say hello 

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:19.480
 general to all all completed mere 

00:00:15.969 --> 00:00:22.660
 vote of arms now let's move on to the video 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:25.029
 which obviously speaks of battlefield 4 but 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:26.830
 in particular the disarmament mode which 

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:28.720
 is in the list and the modes 

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:31.599
 in the boom of the multiplayer of bastos below 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:33.969
 par and what is the disarmament mode 

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:36.430
 I will try to explain bra is simpler 

00:00:33.969 --> 00:00:38.110
 so you can have this race 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:40.450
 of the old battlefield 3 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:42.370
 well it's just about the same as the bomb was 

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:45.129
 you will have to take you in the spot and then 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:46.200
 will stand by the targets a and b that they are 

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:48.789
 protected from enemies 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.350
 obviously it is useless to tell you that you will have to 

00:00:48.789 --> 00:00:51.579
 play as a team if you want to win 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:53.469
 in this mode 

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:56.530
 but guys, but it's only one shift 

00:00:53.469 --> 00:00:59.350
 but rather of six chemical shifts and more 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:02.079
 rounds then won the game the 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:03.370
 teams are composed of 5 players if 

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:06.100
 all opponents succeed 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:08.170
 you will still win the round 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:10.869
 in fact in this mode it becomes more 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:11.470
 to kill the opponent who to place 

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:14.860
 the bomb 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:15.909
 well it expired what this is 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:18.880
 modality 

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:21.220
 but I didn't tell you how to win it then 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:23.049
 let's take a few simple tips 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:25.960
 to win 

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:27.850
 first advice that I can give you well if 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:30.280
 you have a clan all accessory of 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:33.700
 microphone the game will be easy 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:35.200
 pleasant and with assured victory but 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:37.540
 if you don't have a clan 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:39.250
 the chances of victory will decrease 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:40.890
 so what to do 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:44.680
 and here we pass to the second council 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:46.479
 be careful and look carefully at the i area 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:49.990
 Enemies are always hiding near the 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:53.229
 goals don't be fooled third 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:56.079
 advice try to understand and learn 

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:58.299
 the map at its best so as to turn it no 

00:01:56.079 --> 00:02:00.280
 street your enemies and if you don't have 

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:01.860
 a good network team or Scene 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:06.960
 chance to win 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:10.560
 fourth advice try to get out and not 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:13.120
 let you see let's say from your enemies 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:16.870
 because the more hidden you will be 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:17.700
 in addition they will be the probability of 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:22.330
 to win 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:24.099
 fifth advice, try to use weapons 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:26.769
 with a long range 

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:29.920
 so if you are in trouble you will not have to 

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:31.409
 get too close with weapons they have 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:34.989
 a long range 

00:02:31.409 --> 00:02:38.230
 and if you don't have weapons with a long one 

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:42.010
 range or prefer weapons with one 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:44.409
 lower output but the guys throw 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:46.599
 minors you will have to look for a clash more 

00:02:44.409 --> 00:02:50.590
 close then there is more danger than 

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:52.569
 your enemies b surround and you could 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:55.000
 die or if you are so strong from 

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:57.390
 get by so I recommend weapons from 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.730
 long range to always stay a while 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:02.650
 distant because veil of I told you in 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:05.799
 this mode tends to decide more 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:08.739
 to the opponent to place the sixth bomb 

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:11.950
 advice sometimes sixth and last 

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:14.470
 advice sometimes you might find yourself 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:16.959
 in very unpleasant and very situations 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:19.269
 very difficult where you are the only man 

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:22.120
 it is the only hope to win this 

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:25.030
 turn or maybe just the last round 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:27.250
 to win the whole match what 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:29.410
 you have to do first keep the 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:30.730
 calm and look for a place where you can 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:32.919
 handle the situation 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:35.109
 checking that the enemies arrive or 

00:03:32.919 --> 00:03:36.790
 better if you get the enemies you can 

00:03:35.109 --> 00:03:39.760
 kill them easily 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:41.109
 well these were the few tips 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:42.819
 that I give you 

00:03:41.109 --> 00:03:45.099
 I hope I have been useful is that there is 

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:49.109
 liked the video first though 

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:52.660
 I would like to prolong it by saying 

00:03:49.109 --> 00:03:56.970
 speaking a bit about my channel, yes 

00:03:52.660 --> 00:04:01.269
 deals with video games at 305 at 360 degrees is 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:04.810
 appeared from a nice shooter ai in dior 

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:09.370
 now pc games for any adventure 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:11.500
 the game that can please you at all 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:14.500
 the youtube community to all 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:17.829
 Italians and therefore I try to be interested 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:20.799
 more in the final writing 

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:21.909
 what do you look for and what can you please? 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:24.039
 signed up 

00:04:21.909 --> 00:04:24.930
 so I would like it if you pass 

00:04:24.039 --> 00:04:28.169
 maybe damage 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:29.520
 bad and see if any video if I can 

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:32.280
 a smile to tear your mother away 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:33.780
 let me also like it is not said 

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:37.289
 that you ought to perhaps register 

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:39.360
 maybe I may not even like it 

00:04:37.289 --> 00:04:41.130
 so I talked about my channel 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:43.650
 I would like to thank the staff of me again 

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:44.789
 I go to arms if this video comes 

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:47.580
 published 

00:04:44.789 --> 00:04:50.729
 and to give a chance to grow 

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:53.910
 so this is all from mikimix i hope 

00:04:50.729 --> 00:04:55.110
 however the video is liked and is 

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:58.349
 was to your liking 

00:04:55.110 --> 00:05:02.060
 and we get the next video then 

00:04:58.349 --> 00:05:02.060
 step and close from mikimix
