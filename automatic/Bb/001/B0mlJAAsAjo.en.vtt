 We are very, very close and another little thing 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:56.019
 guys that I want to comment is that this 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:57.699
 video reaches a goal if a goal of 

00:00:56.019 --> 00:00:59.800
 more than 200 likes kid I know this 

00:00:57.699 --> 00:01:01.809
 video deserves it deserves to get to 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:03.910
 that great goal and they will see a video of 

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:05.890
 background and good guys that will try 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:07.930
 this video good guys is going to be from a 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:11.680
 epic theory of minecraft little edition 0 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:13.899
 point 12.00 point 12.1 wil 4 of the 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:15.910
 next wheels ok guys because it's going 

00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:18.640
 because this theory is going to be because there 

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:21.280
 many or many items that do not come out 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:23.560
 I think they do not come out or I do not know is not 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:26.050
 possible that in his rival leave by 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:28.990
 example the potato forgive the potato another 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:31.600
 another file the rabbit's foot which is a thing 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:33.940
 it's a very strange thing since he caught me 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:36.100
 that of edition not because there can not be 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:38.950
 rabbits or until now there are no rabbits 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:40.330
 basically and good guys also the 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:41.560
 background video they will see that they are 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:44.920
 hitting but one 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:46.899
 a true madrid you can say a 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:48.159
 Real Madrid, but I said 

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:51.250
 I'm her doing what I can 

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:54.189
 basically because I'm really bad and so 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:56.049
 the truth I think for a few moments 

00:01:54.189 --> 00:01:58.659
 a few moments I had to remove the 

00:01:56.049 --> 00:02:01.270
 difficulty too and good guys good 

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:02.679
 let's continue other things that 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:04.210
 also for example the weather the 

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:06.970
 weather is not in what is micro 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:09.250
 pocket edition 0.12 zero point because 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:10.780
 because the reason they never never said 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:12.310
 they were going to add widder however 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:14.769
 are the wheeler heads that thing 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:16.450
 which is very strange because it can 

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:18.940
 that there is widder in the following wheels 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:20.620
 another thing too that also many 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:23.620
 but many have realized that they are 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:25.090
 the dow jones junctions until now 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:26.410
 there has not been, or I never have 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:28.420
 found in a meeting I do not know if 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:30.459
 you have found an owner but 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:32.709
 I believe that at the moment of unions 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:33.849
 there are so they are going to implement that yes 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:36.310
 they will implement it in the following 

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:38.470
 wheels what is the weather and the rabbit 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:42.040
 it is possible that they implement it in other 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:45.069
 wheels or it is simply possible that 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:47.560
 that they implement it in what is in what 

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:49.209
 that what is loyal to 0.13 point zero 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:50.890
 just as the network are guys I also 

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:53.530
 have asked about the network are redstone 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:55.659
 new vein 0.12 zero point is impossible 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:57.700
 is that it is impossible to do 

00:02:55.659 --> 00:02:59.859
 redstone in what is zero in which the 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:01.540
 0.12 point zero since I never 

00:02:59.859 --> 00:03:03.849
 they mentioned or they never said anything 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:05.769
 about it so good to be steel 

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:08.109
 point 12.1 this point of that point zero 

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:09.760
 there will be no redstone ok 

00:03:08.109 --> 00:03:12.129
 in the following wild although they are or not 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:14.590
 is going to have redstone to see another little thing 

00:03:12.129 --> 00:03:15.730
 it's also that rabbits are also all 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:18.040
 they are asking me about the damned 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:19.540
 rabbits things that rabbits never said 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:22.000
 I was going to see you rabbits I never saw 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:24.970
 no comment or what minimum they said 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.919
 baby rabbits at 0.12 point zero and 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:28.450
 well and rabbits I think it's not going to 

00:03:26.919 --> 00:03:30.669
 have in the block do in the micro 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:34.000
 occasion 0.12 point zero 

00:03:30.669 --> 00:03:35.590
 another little thing that another thing also leader 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.540
 the leader will fix it because the 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:39.819
 medium is is not right the never 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:42.069
 basically the leader is not right or is 

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:44.439
 when you enter neider gives you some 

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:45.690
 tremendous the awesome things 

00:03:44.439 --> 00:03:47.560
 that also in the following versions 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:50.319
 obviously they are going to fix it 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:53.380
 another thing is that it is they came back to 

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:55.120
 see in these wheels a ship I think that 

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:58.750
 they will leave it like this because many people 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:04:01.630
 they angered what is the snow golem 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:04.780
 in the face that and another thing too 

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:07.150
 guys that in what is survival not 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:09.580
 there's no survival basically there's no 

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:11.290
 Enchantment table at the moment 

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:14.170
 there is survival only in creative 

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:15.489
 because it was something that they implemented and what 

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:17.709
 they were going to implement only with 

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:19.419
 commands but decided to remove the 

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:21.160
 commands for minecraft pocket edition and 

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:23.169
 obviously when removing the commands 

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:24.760
 they had to forcefully put what is the 

00:04:23.169 --> 00:04:27.040
 spell table 

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:28.960
 but in survival I repeat it again in 

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:30.460
 Survival is not yet table 

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:32.650
 enchantments because many also 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:34.000
 they ask why if I get the 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:36.190
 table enchantments not the table 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:39.340
 enchantments is not and something else 

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:41.200
 also guys is that I do not already this 

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:42.190
 it is no longer relevant, but another thing is that 

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:43.810
 I also want you not to walk 

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:45.970
 asking every time for the server 

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:47.650
 guys from my server that if I already 

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:49.419
 update obviously there is not a server 

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:51.310
 I also want to comment that I do not 

00:04:49.419 --> 00:04:53.380
 There is no server in minecraft that 

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:55.180
 edition 0.12 point zero 

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:57.190
 the first servers and always the 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:05:00.400
 first servers are already pulling them out 

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:03.670
 from build 4 or will 5 I'll come back 

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:05.860
 to repeat to bone you are buils 4 or 5 are 

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:07.480
 those that add things and are the willis 

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:09.760
 who arrange most of the ships 

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:11.380
 what's so good these are these wheels 

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:13.420
 they are going to be super cool 

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:16.990
 maybe we can already maybe I can 

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:18.520
 have what is what is creative 

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:20.440
 forgiveness in survival the table 

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:22.930
 training and may have the 

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:25.090
 first servers the truth would be 

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:27.130
 Very cool that already implement the 

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:29.200
 servers for minecraft trial 0.12 

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:31.600
 points 0 will serve me still will not be my 

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:33.880
 server or my server is not so pro 

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:36.460
 to hold on to good to be 

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:38.440
 right now at the 0.12 point 

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:39.940
 zero serve me and the one of jon that is left 

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:41.740
 clear because many people ask me to 

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:43.510
 Sometimes I say a lot, it serves me but without 

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:45.280
 But not only mine is also my friend 

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:48.070
 me and good guys I wanted to make it clear 

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:50.350
 all kinds of doubts of answers all 

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:51.970
 these kinds of doubts that all have 

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:53.230
 asked and good guys I say goodbye 

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:55.560
