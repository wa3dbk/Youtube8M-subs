00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:15.869
 how about friends this time 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:18.150
 I will show how to invest the memories in 

00:00:15.869 --> 00:00:20.110
 your android device that is the lg pro 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:23.290
 Light 

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:25.810
 I will explain shortly what you mean 

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:27.340
 with investing memories is that I 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:29.710
 it seems that the internal memory of this 

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:32.380
 device is left available 4 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:35.170
 gigabytes then this internal memory 

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:38.020
 will become the external memory or the sd 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:42.820
 in honor of SD and the external memory that 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:45.820
 is a micro sd that can be 48 16 or 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:48.370
 32 gigas will be in place of the 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:50.440
 internal memory and all games or 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:52.780
 all the things that install you that you 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:56.050
 are you installed is going to stay 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:58.020
 stored a sd memory that here you 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:59.860
 it would appear as internal memory 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:02.650
 then they are requirements that is 

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:04.150
 indispensable the zero zero rice if not 

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:07.509
 you are you can get here on my channel 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:11.290
 where will it show you how 00 root then 

00:01:07.509 --> 00:01:12.729
 already once I told you this you're going to 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:14.320
 download the application that is you 

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:16.660
 leaving here below in the description of 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:19.420
 video once you have downloaded the 

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:21.990
 you go to your device's looking 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:21.990
 install 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.590
 it's not clear, it's next you're going to give it in 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:45.740
 open and this window appears 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:47.600
 superuser you will give and allow 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:49.300
 I have another window appears where you going to 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:53.560
 give tongue 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:57.610
 then you have to have done this you 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:59.710
 it's going to look like all this information 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:03.220
 you are going to choose where it says 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:04.890
 it's by default that you're going to mark this 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:07.890
 option 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:09.780
 once you have done this, it happens here to 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:14.130
 shortly after this option appears that 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:18.540
 says of original internal multipoint 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:23.350
 you are going to click or you are going to select it and 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:26.430
 are you going to write the following diagonal 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:26.430
 the ag 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:32.900
 diagonal 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:36.950
 sd card 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:39.260
 0 and it must be accept once you've 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:43.310
 done this you're going to go the option where it says 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:46.330
 of external original the meeting point and 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:48.850
 you are going to write the following 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:51.840
 diagonal 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:51.840
 stora g 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:57.300
 diagonal 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:57.300
 external 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:02.200
 had a low 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:09.550
 with capital letters sda and then accept 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:12.280
 once you've done this you go here 

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:15.340
 in the last option that says view the 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:18.070
 different device and you will click or 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:20.380
 you are going to select it and as you can see 

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:24.310
 will open another list of options and 

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:28.760
 here you go to look for options says b fat 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:32.930
 Fs tells me two fat points 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:36.409
 here in my case it seems to me that they appear 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:39.110
 12 either of the two works can 

00:03:36.409 --> 00:03:41.120
 appear in the first one may seem 

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:43.450
 the last option then you will 

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:43.450
 they are going to give 

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:53.390
 and do not believe them then they go back 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:55.370
 and here 

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:57.140
 they will seem unmarked and they will 

00:03:55.370 --> 00:04:00.590
 put here where are you going to select this 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:04.840
 says that wood and they are going to put it here 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:06.700
 They must click on external flashlight 

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:10.440
 once we have done that we are going to 

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:10.440
 proceed to restart the device 

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:07.990
 and let's wait where Caribbean touch in 

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:07.990
 the system 

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:34.229
 and we are going to review our storage 

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:37.620
 so they see that the memories are 

00:05:34.229 --> 00:05:40.669
 they invested in my case in my memory sd 

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:40.669
 is 16 gigs 

00:05:48.569 --> 00:05:53.699
 as you can see and here it appears 

00:05:50.669 --> 00:05:56.300
 phone storage and space 

00:05:53.699 --> 00:05:59.819
 it says that they are 14 towns of between 2 gigas 

00:05:56.300 --> 00:06:03.040
 and I stayed available in 11 score 

00:05:59.819 --> 00:06:07.840
 of 8 gigs and here I think 

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:10.740
 where it says microsd total space 4.67 

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:13.690
 gigas and available of 1.20 lives 

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:15.240
 Then, there were already invested the 

00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:17.639
 memoirs 

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:20.750
 and other things that I happened to tell you 

00:06:17.639 --> 00:06:22.569
 that this method only works for 

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:25.330
 in the system 

00:06:22.569 --> 00:06:28.439
 for the youtube version and we do not 

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:30.939
 it's for the kat kit then if you're 

00:06:28.439 --> 00:06:32.879
 if your device is already updated 

00:06:30.939 --> 00:06:35.339
 with kat kit you will not be able to use it 

00:06:32.879 --> 00:06:40.770
 nothing else is for the geely mine 

00:06:35.339 --> 00:06:43.029
 so then if you want to reverse this 

00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:45.249
 this process the only thing that you have to 

00:06:43.029 --> 00:06:46.929
 to do is to disintegrate the application and 

00:06:45.249 --> 00:06:49.689
 restart phone and at the time of 

00:06:46.929 --> 00:06:52.599
 to be rebooted is going to appear 

00:06:49.689 --> 00:06:55.389
 normally then that would be all of 

00:06:52.599 --> 00:06:56.619
 my part remembering action you do not like me 

00:06:55.389 --> 00:07:00.039
 give little hand up 

00:06:56.619 --> 00:07:02.039
 share it subscribe and remember 

00:07:00.039 --> 00:07:04.270
 download my application where you can 

00:07:02.039 --> 00:07:08.349
 find out about the videos that I will be 

00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:11.270
 going up and you can girls follow me on ims 

00:07:08.349 --> 00:07:13.870
 of my profile and so on 

00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:13.870
 well, sometimes
