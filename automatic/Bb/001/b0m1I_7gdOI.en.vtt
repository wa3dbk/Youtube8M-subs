stern drive or outboard power boats
basically<00:00:21.300> four<00:00:21.510> simple<00:00:21.840> steps<00:00:21.900> and<00:00:22.289> I'm

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
basically four simple steps and I'm

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:23.450 
basically four simple steps and I'm
going<00:00:22.619> to<00:00:22.680> take<00:00:22.800> you<00:00:22.890> through<00:00:23.070> it<00:00:23.160> right<00:00:23.310> now

okay so I told you there was four simple

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:27.560 
okay so I told you there was four simple
steps<00:00:26.160> step<00:00:26.400> one<00:00:26.730> is<00:00:26.880> to<00:00:27.060> line<00:00:27.269> up<00:00:27.390> your

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
steps step one is to line up your

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.630 
steps step one is to line up your
approach<00:00:27.840> step<00:00:28.140> two<00:00:28.410> is<00:00:28.560> to<00:00:28.590> come<00:00:29.039> in<00:00:29.189> slow

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
approach step two is to come in slow

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.780 
approach step two is to come in slow
step<00:00:30.599> three<00:00:31.050> is<00:00:31.320> the<00:00:31.830> time<00:00:32.070> your<00:00:32.309> swing<00:00:32.550> and

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
step three is the time your swing and

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.590 
step three is the time your swing and
step<00:00:33.329> four<00:00:33.690> is<00:00:34.489> the<00:00:35.489> flourishing<00:00:36.030> finish<00:00:36.390> here

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
step four is the flourishing finish here

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.810 
step four is the flourishing finish here
we<00:00:36.750> go<00:00:36.930> step<00:00:37.350> one<00:00:37.620> lining<00:00:38.309> up<00:00:38.399> your<00:00:38.430> approach

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
we go step one lining up your approach

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.610 
we go step one lining up your approach
this<00:00:39.030> is<00:00:39.210> where<00:00:39.360> your<00:00:39.510> judgment<00:00:39.960> comes<00:00:40.170> in<00:00:40.440> if

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
this is where your judgment comes in if

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.560 
this is where your judgment comes in if
you've<00:00:41.160> got<00:00:41.340> window<00:00:41.640> current<00:00:41.940> behind<00:00:42.270> you<00:00:42.450> you

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
you've got window current behind you you

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.479 
you've got window current behind you you
want<00:00:42.750> to<00:00:42.780> come<00:00:42.989> in<00:00:43.140> fairly<00:00:43.590> shallow<00:00:43.860> to<00:00:44.160> help

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
want to come in fairly shallow to help

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.060 
want to come in fairly shallow to help
you<00:00:44.610> stay<00:00:44.820> off<00:00:45.000> the<00:00:45.180> dock<00:00:45.390> if<00:00:45.809> you<00:00:46.620> got<00:00:46.770> window

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
you stay off the dock if you got window

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:48.770 
you stay off the dock if you got window
current<00:00:47.399> against<00:00:47.940> you<00:00:48.120> you're<00:00:48.360> going<00:00:48.450> to<00:00:48.539> need

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
current against you you're going to need

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.540 
current against you you're going to need
to<00:00:48.960> come<00:00:49.110> in<00:00:49.230> a<00:00:49.260> little<00:00:49.530> steeper<00:00:49.950> to<00:00:50.070> order<00:00:50.430> to

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
to come in a little steeper to order to

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.520 
to come in a little steeper to order to
carry<00:00:50.760> more<00:00:51.000> momentum<00:00:51.600> to<00:00:51.809> finish<00:00:52.320> the

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
carry more momentum to finish the

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.150 
carry more momentum to finish the
docking<00:00:53.809> so<00:00:54.809> if<00:00:55.140> you<00:00:55.350> notice<00:00:55.649> I'm<00:00:55.770> bumping<00:00:55.980> the

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
docking so if you notice I'm bumping the

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.740 
docking so if you notice I'm bumping the
engines<00:00:56.489> in<00:00:56.640> and<00:00:56.789> out<00:00:56.879> of<00:00:57.030> gear<00:00:57.239> I've<00:00:57.480> got<00:00:57.719> a

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
engines in and out of gear I've got a

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.479 
engines in and out of gear I've got a
fairly<00:00:58.140> stiff<00:00:58.410> wind<00:00:58.590> behind<00:00:58.980> me<00:00:59.160> today<00:00:59.280> so

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
fairly stiff wind behind me today so

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.880 
fairly stiff wind behind me today so
it's<00:00:59.789> going<00:00:59.910> to<00:01:00.030> help<00:01:00.149> me<00:01:00.239> along<00:01:00.420> so<00:01:00.840> I'm<00:01:01.680> just

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
it's going to help me along so I'm just

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.439 
it's going to help me along so I'm just
bumping<00:01:02.160> an<00:01:02.370> engine<00:01:02.640> in<00:01:02.760> and<00:01:02.879> out<00:01:02.969> of<00:01:03.120> gear<00:01:03.300> to

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
bumping an engine in and out of gear to

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:06.950 
bumping an engine in and out of gear to
keep<00:01:04.049> my<00:01:04.199> headway<00:01:04.670> pretty<00:01:05.670> limited<00:01:06.150> so<00:01:06.450> step

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
keep my headway pretty limited so step

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.320 
keep my headway pretty limited so step
two<00:01:07.170> come<00:01:07.530> in<00:01:07.680> slow<00:01:08.040> never<00:01:08.610> approach<00:01:08.970> a<00:01:09.119> dock

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
two come in slow never approach a dock

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.590 
two come in slow never approach a dock
any<00:01:09.630> faster<00:01:10.170> than<00:01:10.320> you're<00:01:10.439> willing<00:01:10.710> to<00:01:10.830> hit<00:01:11.070> it

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:11.600 
any faster than you're willing to hit it

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.210 
any faster than you're willing to hit it
so<00:01:12.600> with<00:01:12.750> this<00:01:12.869> wind<00:01:13.110> behind<00:01:13.290> me<00:01:13.710> that's

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
so with this wind behind me that's

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:15.980 
so with this wind behind me that's
probably<00:01:14.580> about<00:01:14.820> all<00:01:14.970> the<00:01:15.240> headway<00:01:15.570> I<00:01:15.600> need

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
probably about all the headway I need

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.380 
probably about all the headway I need
now<00:01:16.200> I'm<00:01:16.409> aiming<00:01:16.890> for<00:01:17.100> about<00:01:17.220> the<00:01:17.610> center<00:01:18.119> of

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
now I'm aiming for about the center of

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.920 
now I'm aiming for about the center of
where<00:01:18.720> I<00:01:18.990> want<00:01:19.350> to<00:01:19.530> tie<00:01:19.740> alongside<00:01:20.130> the<00:01:20.580> dock

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:20.930 
where I want to tie alongside the dock

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:23.359 
where I want to tie alongside the dock
and<00:01:21.930> this<00:01:22.259> wind<00:01:22.530> is<00:01:22.619> carrying<00:01:22.830> me<00:01:23.100> in<00:01:23.189> pretty

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
and this wind is carrying me in pretty

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:24.590 
and this wind is carrying me in pretty
good<00:01:23.580> I'm<00:01:23.729> just<00:01:23.820> gonna<00:01:24.030> give<00:01:24.150> it<00:01:24.240> one<00:01:24.390> more

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
good I'm just gonna give it one more

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.429 
good I'm just gonna give it one more
little<00:01:24.720> bump<00:01:25.820> and<00:01:26.820> step<00:01:27.689> three<00:01:27.930> is<00:01:27.990> time<00:01:28.229> your

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
little bump and step three is time your

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.380 
little bump and step three is time your
swing<00:01:28.710> I'm<00:01:28.829> about<00:01:29.040> a<00:01:29.100> boat<00:01:29.490> length<00:01:29.729> away<00:01:29.939> and

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
swing I'm about a boat length away and

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.359 
swing I'm about a boat length away and
I'm<00:01:30.540> gonna<00:01:30.689> swing<00:01:31.049> the<00:01:31.170> wheel<00:01:31.350> hard<00:01:31.950> to

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
I'm gonna swing the wheel hard to

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:33.859 
I'm gonna swing the wheel hard to
starboard<00:01:32.820> now<00:01:32.970> this<00:01:33.119> is<00:01:33.240> all<00:01:33.390> for<00:01:33.600> a<00:01:33.630> port

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
starboard now this is all for a port

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.469 
starboard now this is all for a port
side<00:01:34.110> tide<00:01:34.409> so<00:01:34.860> the<00:01:34.979> starboard<00:01:35.460> turn<00:01:35.700> a<00:01:35.970> little

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
side tide so the starboard turn a little

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.660 
side tide so the starboard turn a little
kick<00:01:36.720> of<00:01:36.869> engine<00:01:37.200> just<00:01:37.350> to<00:01:37.470> get<00:01:37.619> it<00:01:37.740> to<00:01:37.770> swing

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
kick of engine just to get it to swing

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.810 
kick of engine just to get it to swing
now<00:01:39.000> my<00:01:39.210> turns<00:01:40.110> going<00:01:40.380> to<00:01:40.590> port<00:01:40.860> and<00:01:41.100> as<00:01:41.610> I'm

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
now my turns going to port and as I'm

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.670 
now my turns going to port and as I'm
about<00:01:41.939> parallel<00:01:42.810> with<00:01:42.990> the<00:01:43.110> dock<00:01:43.320> I'm<00:01:43.530> going

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
about parallel with the dock I'm going

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.830
