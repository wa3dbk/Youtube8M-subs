00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:09.599 
important that we start taking cases and

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:11.930 
important that we start taking cases and

incipio dotty case the iphone for the

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:29.390 
incipio dotty case the iphone for the
first<00:00:28.470> thing<00:00:28.619> you're<00:00:28.740> going<00:00:28.830> to<00:00:28.890> notice<00:00:29.039> about

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
first thing you're going to notice about

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.490 
first thing you're going to notice about
this<00:00:29.550> case<00:00:29.730> is<00:00:29.910> it's<00:00:30.240> funky<00:00:30.630> design<00:00:30.960> and<00:00:31.170> the

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
this case is it's funky design and the

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.080 
this case is it's funky design and the
fact<00:00:31.710> that<00:00:31.800> it's<00:00:31.980> a<00:00:32.099> silicon<00:00:32.579> case<00:00:32.610> which

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
fact that it's a silicon case which

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:34.430 
fact that it's a silicon case which
means<00:00:33.329> it's<00:00:33.480> going<00:00:33.570> to<00:00:33.690> be<00:00:33.780> good<00:00:33.989> protection

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
means it's going to be good protection

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.500 
means it's going to be good protection
but<00:00:35.160> it's<00:00:35.309> not<00:00:35.520> going<00:00:35.730> to<00:00:35.850> damage<00:00:36.000> your<00:00:36.239> device

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
but it's not going to damage your device

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:42.020 
but it's not going to damage your device
while<00:00:36.989> doing<00:00:37.230> so<00:00:40.399> one<00:00:41.399> thing<00:00:41.579> I<00:00:41.640> will<00:00:41.700> have<00:00:41.910> to

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
while doing so one thing I will have to

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:43.580 
while doing so one thing I will have to
mention<00:00:42.210> about<00:00:42.360> this<00:00:42.629> case<00:00:42.870> is<00:00:43.079> when<00:00:43.260> applying

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
mention about this case is when applying

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.110 
mention about this case is when applying
it<00:00:43.800> to<00:00:43.829> the<00:00:43.980> phone<00:00:44.160> itself<00:00:44.520> you<00:00:44.820> will<00:00:44.850> notice

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
it to the phone itself you will notice

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.670 
it to the phone itself you will notice
around<00:00:45.420> the<00:00:45.600> bottom<00:00:45.899> edges<00:00:46.020> it<00:00:46.289> is<00:00:46.469> pretty

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
around the bottom edges it is pretty

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.830 
around the bottom edges it is pretty
tight<00:00:46.980> however<00:00:47.730> in<00:00:47.910> my<00:00:48.149> opinion<00:00:48.180> this<00:00:48.660> is<00:00:48.719> a

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
tight however in my opinion this is a

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.330 
tight however in my opinion this is a
good<00:00:49.020> thing<00:00:49.050> as<00:00:49.350> it<00:00:49.410> will<00:00:49.800> let<00:00:49.950> you<00:00:50.039> know<00:00:50.070> that

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
cases however you want to say it when

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.529 
cases however you want to say it when
the<00:00:55.920> case<00:00:56.100> is<00:00:56.250> around<00:00:56.520> the<00:00:56.730> iphone<00:00:57.120> you<00:00:57.420> will

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
the case is around the iphone you will

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:58.639 
the case is around the iphone you will
notice<00:00:57.690> that<00:00:57.960> it's<00:00:58.079> going<00:00:58.199> to<00:00:58.260> add<00:00:58.440> a<00:00:58.590> little

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
notice that it's going to add a little

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.950 
notice that it's going to add a little
bit<00:00:58.980> of<00:00:59.039> book<00:00:59.280> however<00:01:00.149> the<00:01:00.300> book<00:01:00.480> is<00:01:00.660> going<00:01:00.809> to

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
bit of book however the book is going to

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.750 
bit of book however the book is going to
provide<00:01:01.289> a<00:01:01.530> lot<00:01:01.920> more<00:01:02.100> protection<00:01:02.730> than

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
provide a lot more protection than

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.450 
provide a lot more protection than
normal<00:01:03.210> also<00:01:03.870> with<00:01:04.049> the<00:01:04.140> silicon<00:01:04.619> feel<00:01:04.860> you

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
normal also with the silicon feel you

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.850 
normal also with the silicon feel you
are<00:01:05.610> not<00:01:05.790> going<00:01:06.030> to<00:01:06.180> be<00:01:06.330> as<00:01:06.510> likely<00:01:07.170> to<00:01:07.409> drop

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
are not going to be as likely to drop

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.740 
are not going to be as likely to drop
your<00:01:08.130> phone<00:01:08.400> virus<00:01:08.790> slipping<00:01:09.330> out<00:01:09.420> of<00:01:09.479> your

your phone virus slipping out of your

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.219 
your phone virus slipping out of your
fingers<00:01:11.450> one<00:01:12.450> of<00:01:12.540> my<00:01:12.630> favorite<00:01:12.990> things<00:01:13.170> about

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
fingers one of my favorite things about

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:14.960 
fingers one of my favorite things about
this<00:01:13.470> case<00:01:13.680> is<00:01:13.920> the<00:01:14.189> fact<00:01:14.400> that<00:01:14.460> the<00:01:14.640> buttons

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
this case is the fact that the buttons

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.749 
this case is the fact that the buttons
are<00:01:15.090> easy<00:01:15.240> to<00:01:15.450> access<00:01:15.869> and<00:01:16.020> they<00:01:16.920> feel<00:01:17.189> really

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
are easy to access and they feel really

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.820 
are easy to access and they feel really
nice<00:01:17.880> some<00:01:18.630> cases<00:01:19.020> I've<00:01:19.140> used<00:01:19.320> on<00:01:19.470> nylon

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
nice some cases I've used on nylon

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.890 
nice some cases I've used on nylon
impossible<00:01:20.460> to<00:01:20.790> use<00:01:21.030> the<00:01:21.210> buttons<00:01:21.570> without

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
impossible to use the buttons without

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.130 
impossible to use the buttons without
having<00:01:22.320> to<00:01:22.409> take<00:01:22.560> the<00:01:22.710> case<00:01:22.860> off<00:01:23.960> unlike<00:01:24.960> the

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
having to take the case off unlike the

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.289 
having to take the case off unlike the
iphone<00:01:25.170> itself<00:01:25.920> the<00:01:26.220> dotty<00:01:26.460> right<00:01:26.850> out<00:01:27.060> of<00:01:27.090> the

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
iphone itself the dotty right out of the

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:30.200 
iphone itself the dotty right out of the
box<00:01:27.509> is<00:01:27.750> customizable<00:01:28.590> and<00:01:28.790> I<00:01:29.790> will<00:01:30.030> have<00:01:30.150> to

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
box is customizable and I will have to

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.510 
box is customizable and I will have to
say<00:01:30.450> it<00:01:30.659> is<00:01:30.840> pretty<00:01:31.079> easy<00:01:31.170> to<00:01:31.650> customize<00:01:31.829> which

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
say it is pretty easy to customize which

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.819 
say it is pretty easy to customize which
is<00:01:32.700> a<00:01:32.729> nice<00:01:32.880> and<00:01:33.180> also<00:01:33.360> I<00:01:33.720> found<00:01:34.079> it<00:01:34.290> pretty<00:01:34.439> fun

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
is a nice and also I found it pretty fun

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:36.890 
is a nice and also I found it pretty fun
and<00:01:35.040> I<00:01:35.400> did<00:01:35.579> actually<00:01:35.729> find<00:01:36.060> myself<00:01:36.270> poking

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
and I did actually find myself poking

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.990 
and I did actually find myself poking
holes<00:01:37.049> in<00:01:37.229> the<00:01:37.350> case<00:01:37.530> just<00:01:38.280> to<00:01:38.400> refill<00:01:38.880> them

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
holes in the case just to refill them

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.800 
holes in the case just to refill them
sad<00:01:39.720> Anana<00:01:41.150> customizing<00:01:42.150> this<00:01:42.240> case<00:01:42.479> can't

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
sad Anana customizing this case can't

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.840
