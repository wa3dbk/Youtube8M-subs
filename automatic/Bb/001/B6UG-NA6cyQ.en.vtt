00:00:00.979 --> 00:00:06.240
 Hello 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:08.370
 then it's as promised tonight I want 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:11.670
 let you see something one thing in 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:15.630
 somehow it supports the thesis that I am 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:18.480
 supporting since the 70s 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:21.900
 a thesis for which I have this 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:26.220
 considered a bit between the madman and the 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:30.029
 Bale Counter I continue to assert from 40 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:31.470
 years now that humanity also for one 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.570
 question of resource shortages 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:36.870
 food should learn willingly or 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:39.690
 not eating insects with him 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:43.530
 intents are a very good food 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:46.739
 protein rich in every substance 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:48.960
 among those that do good fats 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:51.270
 polyunsaturated proteins are full of 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.949
 calories not always ie I mean 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.390
 some are even very maybe not in 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:57.090
 this case because here it is about 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:59.010
 fairly fatty insects of which not 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.600
 we should give up but I guarantee you 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.910
 which also have an excellent taste 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.220
 beyond all taboos and taints 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.409
 mental that we have 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:11.369
 and since I support this thing from 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:16.729
 forever and who knows me every time 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:20.280
 I talk about it looks at me with a mixture between 

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:22.380
 commiseration and admired sympathy of 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:25.560
 serie che matto is a bale counter 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:28.950
 however we pretend to believe it 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:31.619
 I feel compelled to show that 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:34.079
 all in all a lot of evil is not a story 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:36.509
 in the sense that I practice this 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:39.030
 something for the past forty years 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:41.520
 when it happens when the chance 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.960
 I eat some insects I don't say all for 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.730
 example the mosques roll and never eat 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:48.800
 for the simple reason 

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:53.940
 year on things that are not let's say 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:57.060
 exactly in the menu though insects like 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:02:00.240
 these that you see are alive 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:03.000
 these are the larvae of darkness one 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.350
 miller a beetle these are his 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.020
 larvae those that normally come 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:10.470
 called flour moths today I have 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:14.640
 got to find it is a bit non 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:17.730
 I will eat all because they are 200 grams of 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:19.470
 highly caloric meat because I am 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:21.780
 also a little fat and does not make any sense 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:23.850
 I won for so I do not 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:25.710
 I eat everything, but tonight I wanted to 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:28.320
 give him a practical proof of the fact that 

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:30.060
 eating insects is possible and for 

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:32.700
 what concerns me is also very much 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:34.020
 very tasty these are true I don't know 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:37.230
 if he could see that you are 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:44.600
 also moving that more or less though 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:47.460
 an appetite is alive they are very good 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:50.160
 with very good taste 

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:52.040
 sweetish that reminds me of a little milk a 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:54.480
 some pine nuts 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:03:02.220
 here I think you see who they are 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:03:06.209
 live test on humanity will learn to do 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:08.580
 this will solve a lot of problems 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:12.570
 because the insects are very easy to 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:13.890
 breed in large quantities have a 

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:17.520
 reproduction rate which is extremely 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:20.489
 faster than they can be e 

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:24.000
 first cattle hi belluno after a while 

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:26.130
 to you too and above all I am a 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.650
 very healthy food is also very good 

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:32.420
 I guarantee you also eat like this but 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:32.420
 you can also cook them bye
