00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
to Shu after that check engine light

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.810 
to Shu after that check engine light
just<00:01:45.360> what<00:01:45.600> I<00:01:45.659> wanted<00:01:46.170> and<00:01:46.649> that<00:01:47.369> was<00:01:47.430> like<00:01:47.790> a

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
just what I wanted and that was like a

just what I wanted and that was like a
Pio<00:01:48.470> 500<00:01:49.470> if<00:01:49.590> I<00:01:49.710> remember<00:01:50.220> vehicle<00:01:50.640> speed

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
parameters and I guess if you have a car

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.919 
parameters and I guess if you have a car
with<00:02:07.560> variable<00:02:08.069> valve<00:02:08.099> timing<00:02:08.750> which<00:02:09.750> that

with variable valve timing which that
car<00:02:10.110> does<00:02:10.259> not<00:02:10.440> have

it<00:02:12.099> might<00:02:12.370> actually<00:02:12.549> control<00:02:13.180> that<00:02:13.209> as<00:02:13.540> well<00:02:13.780> I

00:02:14.039 --> 00:02:14.049 
it might actually control that as well I

00:02:14.049 --> 00:02:16.410 
it might actually control that as well I
have<00:02:14.560> the<00:02:14.709> slightest<00:02:15.189> but<00:02:15.489> apparently<00:02:16.180> it's<00:02:16.360> a

have the slightest but apparently it's a
pretty<00:02:16.599> vital<00:02:16.900> sensor<00:02:17.700> so<00:02:18.700> it<00:02:19.120> comes<00:02:19.510> as<00:02:19.720> no

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
pretty vital sensor so it comes as no

pretty vital sensor so it comes as no
real<00:02:20.260> surprise<00:02:20.769> that<00:02:20.799> that<00:02:21.450> code<00:02:22.450> was<00:02:22.659> thrown

00:02:22.979 --> 00:02:22.989 
real surprise that that code was thrown

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:26.490 
real surprise that that code was thrown
because<00:02:23.290> if<00:02:24.129> that<00:02:24.459> lost<00:02:24.790> power<00:02:25.120> as<00:02:25.450> she<00:02:26.200> states

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500 
because if that lost power as she states

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:30.960 
because if that lost power as she states
it<00:02:26.680> did<00:02:28.379> then<00:02:29.379> that<00:02:29.799> would<00:02:30.250> wreak<00:02:30.400> all<00:02:30.579> sorts

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:30.970 
it did then that would wreak all sorts

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:32.610 
it did then that would wreak all sorts
of<00:02:31.060> havoc<00:02:31.209> I'm<00:02:31.510> surprised<00:02:31.870> didn't<00:02:32.230> throw<00:02:32.409> any

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.620 
of havoc I'm surprised didn't throw any

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:35.789 
of havoc I'm surprised didn't throw any
more<00:02:32.799> codes<00:02:33.069> as<00:02:33.310> a<00:02:33.340> matter<00:02:33.579> of<00:02:33.670> fact<00:02:34.799> that

00:02:35.789 --> 00:02:35.799 
more codes as a matter of fact that

00:02:35.799 --> 00:02:38.940 
more codes as a matter of fact that
problem<00:02:36.129> hasn't<00:02:36.340> returned<00:02:37.500> but<00:02:38.500> regarding

problem hasn't returned but regarding

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:42.690 
problem hasn't returned but regarding
the<00:02:39.010> misfire<00:02:39.659> that<00:02:40.659> did<00:02:40.989> and<00:02:41.290> I<00:02:41.890> got<00:02:42.010> worse<00:02:42.280> and

the misfire that did and I got worse and

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:45.930 
the misfire that did and I got worse and
I<00:02:43.090> got<00:02:43.269> worse<00:02:43.480> and<00:02:43.959> I<00:02:44.079> got<00:02:44.260> worse<00:02:44.440> so<00:02:44.819> it<00:02:45.819> was

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:45.940 
I got worse and I got worse so it was

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:48.539 
I got worse and I got worse so it was
time<00:02:46.120> to<00:02:46.329> put<00:02:46.510> some<00:02:46.720> spark<00:02:47.019> plugs<00:02:47.260> in<00:02:47.500> it<00:02:47.530> so<00:02:48.340> no

00:02:48.539 --> 00:02:48.549 
time to put some spark plugs in it so no

00:02:48.549 --> 00:02:50.309 
time to put some spark plugs in it so no
big<00:02:48.790> deal<00:02:49.030> but<00:02:49.359> I<00:02:49.569> don't<00:02:49.840> have<00:02:49.930> a<00:02:49.959> spark<00:02:50.260> plug

00:02:50.309 --> 00:02:50.319 
big deal but I don't have a spark plug

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:51.960 
big deal but I don't have a spark plug

light<00:03:28.299> but<00:03:28.540> it<00:03:28.690> really<00:03:28.959> was<00:03:29.290> not<00:03:29.470> running

00:03:29.729 --> 00:03:29.739 
light but it really was not running

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:32.909 
light but it really was not running
right<00:03:29.919> and<00:03:30.310> wasn't<00:03:31.000> happy<00:03:31.650> anyway<00:03:32.650> we<00:03:32.799> get

00:03:32.909 --> 00:03:32.919 
right and wasn't happy anyway we get

00:03:32.919 --> 00:03:34.259 
right and wasn't happy anyway we get
over<00:03:33.190> there<00:03:33.310> and<00:03:33.519> after<00:03:33.819> a<00:03:33.849> little<00:03:34.000> bit<00:03:34.120> of

00:03:34.259 --> 00:03:34.269 
over there and after a little bit of

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:37.020 
over there and after a little bit of
farting<00:03:34.629> around<00:03:34.750> I<00:03:35.430> pulled<00:03:36.430> the<00:03:36.489> plug<00:03:36.639> wires

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:37.030 
farting around I pulled the plug wires

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:40.339 
farting around I pulled the plug wires
off<00:03:37.389> put<00:03:38.049> the<00:03:38.169> wrench<00:03:38.379> on<00:03:38.769> the<00:03:39.250> first<00:03:39.519> plug<00:03:39.910> and

00:03:40.339 --> 00:03:40.349 
off put the wrench on the first plug and

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:43.759 
off put the wrench on the first plug and
it<00:03:41.349> required<00:03:41.799> almost<00:03:42.519> no<00:03:42.760> force<00:03:43.090> to<00:03:43.180> remove

00:03:43.759 --> 00:03:43.769 
it required almost no force to remove

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:49.559 
it required almost no force to remove
the<00:03:44.769> plug<00:03:45.099> was<00:03:45.819> finger<00:03:46.209> tight<00:03:46.569> and<00:03:48.329> we<00:03:49.329> went<00:03:49.480> to

00:03:49.559 --> 00:03:49.569 
the plug was finger tight and we went to

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:53.789 
the plug was finger tight and we went to
the<00:03:49.660> next<00:03:49.900> plug<00:03:50.400> same<00:03:51.400> story<00:03:52.199> same<00:03:53.199> story<00:03:53.590> with

00:03:53.789 --> 00:03:53.799 
the next plug same story same story with

00:03:53.799 --> 00:03:57.899 
the next plug same story same story with
all<00:03:54.010> four<00:03:54.340> plugs<00:03:55.409> now<00:03:56.409> that<00:03:56.680> also<00:03:56.949> would

00:03:57.899 --> 00:03:57.909 
all four plugs now that also would

00:03:57.909 --> 00:04:00.000 
all four plugs now that also would
indicate<00:03:58.209> why<00:03:59.169> we're<00:03:59.349> having<00:03:59.560> a<00:03:59.620> misfire

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:00.010 
indicate why we're having a misfire

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:02.309 
indicate why we're having a misfire
because<00:04:00.519> not<00:04:01.239> getting<00:04:01.540> good<00:04:01.629> compression<00:04:02.199> in

00:04:02.309 --> 00:04:02.319 
because not getting good compression in

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:04.559 
because not getting good compression in
the<00:04:02.379> damn<00:04:02.560> cylinders<00:04:03.129> now<00:04:04.030> why<00:04:04.269> were<00:04:04.449> they

00:04:04.559 --> 00:04:04.569 
the damn cylinders now why were they

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:07.699 
the damn cylinders now why were they
finger<00:04:04.900> tight<00:04:05.169> Toyota<00:04:06.760> up<00:04:07.030> again

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:07.709 
finger tight Toyota up again

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:10.949 
finger tight Toyota up again
that's<00:04:08.709> right<00:04:09.129> that<00:04:09.639> car<00:04:09.940> was<00:04:10.180> serviced<00:04:10.720> at

00:04:10.949 --> 00:04:10.959 
that's right that car was serviced at

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:15.330 
that's right that car was serviced at
Toyota<00:04:11.819> probably<00:04:12.819> eight<00:04:13.030> years<00:04:13.510> ago<00:04:13.720> and<00:04:14.340> they

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:15.340 
Toyota probably eight years ago and they

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:17.339 
Toyota probably eight years ago and they
most<00:04:15.639> likely<00:04:16.090> had<00:04:16.299> replaced<00:04:16.690> the<00:04:16.870> plugs<00:04:17.169> I

00:04:17.339 --> 00:04:17.349 
most likely had replaced the plugs I

00:04:17.349 --> 00:04:19.319 
most likely had replaced the plugs I
don't<00:04:17.560> have<00:04:17.709> the<00:04:18.099> exact<00:04:18.430> service<00:04:18.849> records<00:04:19.209> so

00:04:19.319 --> 00:04:19.329 
don't have the exact service records so

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:21.270 
don't have the exact service records so
I<00:04:19.359> don't<00:04:19.599> know<00:04:19.780> but<00:04:20.530> I<00:04:20.560> doubt<00:04:20.680> it<00:04:20.979> came<00:04:21.130> from

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:21.280 
I don't know but I doubt it came from

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:24.390

we're<00:04:25.310> running<00:04:25.640> for<00:04:26.060> probably<00:04:26.960> in<00:04:27.110> the

we're running for probably in the

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:29.610 
we're running for probably in the
neighborhood<00:04:27.260> of<00:04:27.560> 60,000<00:04:28.490> miles<00:04:28.700> or<00:04:28.970> more<00:04:29.000> and

neighborhood of 60,000 miles or more and
they<00:04:30.620> were<00:04:30.680> only<00:04:30.980> finger<00:04:31.340> tight<00:04:31.550> I<00:04:31.820> always

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:32.600 
they were only finger tight I always

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:35.170 
they were only finger tight I always
wondered<00:04:33.020> why<00:04:33.290> the<00:04:34.100> card<00:04:34.430> never<00:04:34.760> really

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:35.180 
wondered why the card never really

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:38.140 
wondered why the card never really
seemed<00:04:35.540> to<00:04:35.660> have<00:04:35.870> a<00:04:36.320> lot<00:04:36.680> of<00:04:36.710> power<00:04:37.010> it<00:04:37.910> always

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:38.150 
seemed to have a lot of power it always

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:42.370 
seemed to have a lot of power it always
just<00:04:38.710> went<00:04:39.710> but<00:04:40.340> it<00:04:40.520> never<00:04:40.730> really<00:04:41.380> really

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:42.380 
just went but it never really really

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:46.350 
just went but it never really really
went<00:04:43.270> so<00:04:44.270> anyway<00:04:44.630> we<00:04:44.870> replace<00:04:45.320> the<00:04:45.560> plugs

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:46.360 
went so anyway we replace the plugs

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:49.690 
went so anyway we replace the plugs
twisted<00:04:47.360> the<00:04:47.450> key<00:04:47.660> fired<00:04:48.320> right<00:04:48.560> up<00:04:48.620> and<00:04:48.980> I

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:49.700 
twisted the key fired right up and I

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:51.940 
twisted the key fired right up and I
could<00:04:49.910> immediately<00:04:50.360> tell<00:04:50.750> just<00:04:51.530> how<00:04:51.590> it<00:04:51.860> was

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:51.950 
could immediately tell just how it was

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:54.250 
could immediately tell just how it was
idling<00:04:52.490> that<00:04:53.180> we<00:04:53.300> had<00:04:53.480> much<00:04:53.960> better

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:54.260 
idling that we had much better

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:56.020 
idling that we had much better
compression<00:04:54.710> going<00:04:55.190> on<00:04:55.280> in<00:04:55.460> the<00:04:55.520> cylinders

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:56.030 
compression going on in the cylinders

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:58.750 
compression going on in the cylinders
and<00:04:56.240> more<00:04:56.900> compression<00:04:57.500> means<00:04:57.710> more<00:04:58.460> power

00:04:58.750 --> 00:04:58.760 
and more compression means more power

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:02.470 
and more compression means more power
took<00:04:59.750> it<00:04:59.870> for<00:05:00.050> a<00:05:00.080> ride<00:05:00.320> around<00:05:00.790> my<00:05:01.790> god<00:05:02.150> it's<00:05:02.390> a

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:02.480 
took it for a ride around my god it's a

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:06.190 
took it for a ride around my god it's a
 rocket<00:05:03.080> ship<00:05:03.440> now<00:05:03.910> amazing<00:05:05.020> so<00:05:06.020> we

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:06.200 
 rocket ship now amazing so we

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:09.370 
 rocket ship now amazing so we
saw<00:05:06.410> the<00:05:06.470> misfire<00:05:07.100> conditioned<00:05:07.760> and<00:05:08.170> the<00:05:09.170> car

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:09.380 
saw the misfire conditioned and the car

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:11.770 
saw the misfire conditioned and the car
has<00:05:09.560> more<00:05:09.830> horsepowers<00:05:10.550> and<00:05:10.820> probably<00:05:11.690> is

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:11.780 
has more horsepowers and probably is

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:13.210 
has more horsepowers and probably is
going<00:05:11.930> to<00:05:11.990> get<00:05:12.140> a<00:05:12.170> lot<00:05:12.380> better<00:05:12.560> fuel<00:05:12.950> economy

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:13.220 
going to get a lot better fuel economy

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:16.390 
going to get a lot better fuel economy
on<00:05:13.640> top<00:05:14.330> of<00:05:14.480> that<00:05:14.570> because<00:05:14.840> now<00:05:15.410> that<00:05:16.160> the

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:16.400 
on top of that because now that the

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:17.920 
on top of that because now that the
plugs<00:05:16.640> are<00:05:16.850> in<00:05:16.940> tight<00:05:17.180> you're<00:05:17.420> getting<00:05:17.660> a<00:05:17.750> lot

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:17.930 
plugs are in tight you're getting a lot

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:20.650 
plugs are in tight you're getting a lot
a<00:05:18.400> higher<00:05:19.400> compression<00:05:19.730> in<00:05:20.150> the<00:05:20.180> cylinder

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:20.660 
a higher compression in the cylinder

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:22.240 
a higher compression in the cylinder
than<00:05:20.810> you<00:05:20.900> were<00:05:21.140> because<00:05:21.710> before<00:05:21.920> it's<00:05:22.220> just

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:22.250 
than you were because before it's just

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:25.980 
than you were because before it's just
blown<00:05:22.610> the<00:05:22.940> out<00:05:23.210> which<00:05:23.870> also<00:05:24.410> is<00:05:24.850> likely

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:25.990 
blown the out which also is likely

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:29.760 
blown the out which also is likely
what<00:05:26.990> was<00:05:27.230> causing<00:05:27.800> that<00:05:27.830> Brown<00:05:28.730> on<00:05:28.880> the

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:29.770 
what was causing that Brown on the

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:34.060 
what was causing that Brown on the
plug<00:05:30.770> wire<00:05:30.980> stalks<00:05:32.260> if<00:05:33.260> you<00:05:33.560> remember<00:05:33.890> in<00:05:33.980> the

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:34.070 
plug wire stalks if you remember in the

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:35.800 
plug wire stalks if you remember in the
video<00:05:34.190> we<00:05:34.610> have<00:05:34.790> like<00:05:35.000> brown<00:05:35.540> on<00:05:35.660> the

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:35.810 
video we have like brown on the

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:38.230 
video we have like brown on the
stalk<00:05:36.110> there<00:05:36.410> well<00:05:37.040> when<00:05:37.370> we<00:05:37.490> pulled<00:05:37.820> the<00:05:37.970> new

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:38.240 
stalk there well when we pulled the new

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:40.780 
stalk there well when we pulled the new
plug<00:05:38.540> wires<00:05:38.840> out<00:05:39.200> just<00:05:40.010> at<00:05:40.130> the<00:05:40.220> tip<00:05:40.460> it<00:05:40.670> was

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:40.790 
plug wires out just at the tip it was

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:42.520 
plug wires out just at the tip it was
starting<00:05:41.150> to<00:05:41.180> do<00:05:41.360> that<00:05:41.540> and<00:05:41.810> that<00:05:42.350> would

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:42.530 
starting to do that and that would

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:44.890 
starting to do that and that would
likely<00:05:42.740> be<00:05:43.100> combustion<00:05:43.670> gases<00:05:44.120> leaking<00:05:44.750> out

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:44.900 
likely be combustion gases leaking out

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:48.990 
likely be combustion gases leaking out
from<00:05:45.320> the<00:05:45.440> threads<00:05:45.800> on<00:05:46.450> the<00:05:47.450> old<00:05:47.600> spark<00:05:47.930> plugs
