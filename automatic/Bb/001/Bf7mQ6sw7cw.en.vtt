that's<00:02:46.930> nice<00:02:47.200> the<00:02:47.470> chain<00:02:47.799> look<00:02:48.160> is<00:02:48.579> uh<00:02:48.639> it's

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:49.420 
that's nice the chain look is uh it's

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:51.599 
that's nice the chain look is uh it's
done<00:02:49.600> really<00:02:49.780> well<00:02:49.959> too<00:02:50.260> it's<00:02:50.650> just<00:02:51.310> really

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:51.609 
done really well too it's just really

00:02:51.609 --> 00:02:53.780 
done really well too it's just really
boring<00:02:52.600> compared<00:02:53.049> to<00:02:53.139> the<00:02:53.230> other<00:02:53.380> bikes

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
boring compared to the other bikes

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:55.949 
boring compared to the other bikes
machine<00:02:54.790> tornado<00:02:55.209> is<00:02:55.389> still<00:02:55.630> my<00:02:55.750> favorite

00:02:55.949 --> 00:02:55.959 
machine tornado is still my favorite

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:56.930 
machine tornado is still my favorite
bike<00:02:56.350> yet

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
bike yet

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:00.240

the<00:02:57.940> paint<00:02:58.239> and<00:02:58.690> the<00:02:58.900> size<00:02:59.200> is<00:02:59.530> just<00:02:59.739> really

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:00.250 
the paint and the size is just really

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:02.910 
the paint and the size is just really
gorgeous<00:03:00.459> on<00:03:00.880> it<00:03:01.139> but<00:03:02.139> I<00:03:02.319> don't<00:03:02.500> know<00:03:02.560> I<00:03:02.769> mean

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:02.920 
gorgeous on it but I don't know I mean

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:04.530 
gorgeous on it but I don't know I mean
I'm<00:03:03.010> excited<00:03:03.130> for<00:03:03.579> it<00:03:03.819> because<00:03:03.940> it's<00:03:04.120> doubled

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:04.540 
I'm excited for it because it's doubled

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:07.050 
I'm excited for it because it's doubled
but<00:03:04.780> it's<00:03:05.170> just<00:03:05.470> a<00:03:05.650> very<00:03:05.680> lackluster<00:03:06.280> bike

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:07.060 
but it's just a very lackluster bike

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:11.940 
but it's just a very lackluster bike
compared<00:03:07.720> to<00:03:07.780> what<00:03:07.930> we<00:03:08.049> have<00:03:08.170> had<00:03:09.510> the<00:03:10.510> -<00:03:11.440> unit

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:11.950 
compared to what we have had the - unit

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:15.899 
compared to what we have had the - unit
and<00:03:12.190> the<00:03:12.870> turbulent<00:03:13.870> are<00:03:14.620> both<00:03:14.980> Thomas<00:03:15.790> you

00:03:15.899 --> 00:03:15.909 
and the turbulent are both Thomas you

00:03:15.909 --> 00:03:17.729 
and the turbulent are both Thomas you
have<00:03:15.939> exclusives<00:03:16.780> I<00:03:16.989> will<00:03:17.170> not<00:03:17.379> be<00:03:17.560> getting

00:03:17.729 --> 00:03:17.739 
have exclusives I will not be getting

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:20.880 
have exclusives I will not be getting
them<00:03:18.840> if<00:03:19.840> they<00:03:20.080> included<00:03:20.500> the

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:20.890 
them if they included the

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:22.530 
them if they included the
part<00:03:21.100> of<00:03:21.190> the<00:03:21.280> bike<00:03:21.460> I<00:03:21.640> probably<00:03:21.910> would<00:03:22.300> get

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:22.540 
part of the bike I probably would get

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:24.180 
part of the bike I probably would get
them<00:03:22.720> but<00:03:22.930> since<00:03:23.110> they're<00:03:23.290> just<00:03:23.440> attachments

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:24.190 
them but since they're just attachments

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:26.400 
them but since they're just attachments
and<00:03:24.430> I'm<00:03:25.090> gonna<00:03:25.300> be<00:03:25.510> displaying<00:03:25.900> it<00:03:26.050> like<00:03:26.200> this

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:26.410 
and I'm gonna be displaying it like this

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:29.040 
and I'm gonna be displaying it like this
I'm<00:03:27.220> not<00:03:27.459> just<00:03:27.700> gonna<00:03:27.760> display<00:03:28.209> the<00:03:28.660> butt<00:03:28.870> end

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:29.050 
I'm not just gonna display the butt end

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:31.680 
I'm not just gonna display the butt end
of<00:03:29.200> a<00:03:29.290> bike<00:03:29.500> on<00:03:29.830> my<00:03:30.040> shelf<00:03:30.340> so<00:03:30.790> I'm<00:03:31.000> not<00:03:31.330> going

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:31.690 
of a bike on my shelf so I'm not going

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:34.980 
of a bike on my shelf so I'm not going
to<00:03:32.020> be<00:03:32.260> getting<00:03:32.440> those<00:03:33.030> but<00:03:34.030> this<00:03:34.420> does<00:03:34.690> pop

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:34.990 
to be getting those but this does pop

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:37.770 
to be getting those but this does pop
off<00:03:35.230> because<00:03:35.740> the<00:03:35.860> hard<00:03:36.780> turbulent

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:37.780 
off because the hard turbulent

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:41.640 
off because the hard turbulent
attachment<00:03:38.590> that<00:03:38.740> fits<00:03:39.280> in<00:03:39.490> right<00:03:40.500> and<00:03:41.500> you

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:41.650 
attachment that fits in right and you

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:44.040 
attachment that fits in right and you
see<00:03:42.010> it<00:03:42.160> yeah<00:03:42.640> there<00:03:43.209> you<00:03:43.300> go<00:03:43.330> right<00:03:43.660> there<00:03:43.720> and

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:44.050 
see it yeah there you go right there and

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:46.440 
see it yeah there you go right there and
then<00:03:44.170> a<00:03:44.200> little<00:03:44.320> peg<00:03:44.560> right<00:03:44.740> there<00:03:45.270> and<00:03:46.270> then

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:46.450 
then a little peg right there and then

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:49.530 
then a little peg right there and then
obviously<00:03:46.600> these<00:03:47.110> do<00:03:47.470> break<00:03:48.160> apart<00:03:49.000> it's<00:03:49.270> just

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:49.540 
obviously these do break apart it's just

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:51.360 
obviously these do break apart it's just
not<00:03:49.750> that<00:03:49.780> it's<00:03:50.380> not<00:03:50.560> that<00:03:50.590> easy<00:03:50.920> and<00:03:51.069> I<00:03:51.190> just

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:51.370 
not that it's not that easy and I just

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:54.240 
not that it's not that easy and I just
did<00:03:51.520> it<00:03:51.640> so<00:03:52.540> all<00:03:53.290> them<00:03:53.530> will<00:03:53.650> look<00:03:53.800> similar<00:03:54.070> to

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:54.250 
did it so all them will look similar to

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:57.240 
did it so all them will look similar to
this<00:03:54.400> and<00:03:54.850> you<00:03:54.910> just<00:03:54.970> take<00:03:55.570> the<00:03:56.010> front<00:03:57.010> half

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:57.250 
this and you just take the front half

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:02.220 
this and you just take the front half
right<00:03:57.670> into<00:03:58.350> right<00:03:59.350> into<00:03:59.380> whatever<00:04:01.019> we<00:04:02.019> put

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:02.230 
right into right into whatever we put

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:10.199 
right into right into whatever we put
this<00:04:02.350> back<00:04:02.560> together<00:04:07.320> okay<00:04:08.910> there<00:04:09.910> we<00:04:10.030> go<00:04:10.060> I

00:04:10.199 --> 00:04:10.209 
this back together okay there we go I

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:25.610 
this back together okay there we go I
guess<00:04:12.420> this<00:04:17.790> all<00:04:18.959> needs<00:04:19.959> to<00:04:20.109> go<00:04:20.410> together<00:04:20.709> just

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:25.620 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:28.620 

like<00:04:26.620> that<00:04:26.979> and<00:04:27.250> we're<00:04:27.460> back<00:04:27.610> to<00:04:27.669> hard-boiled

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:28.630 
like that and we're back to hard-boiled

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:28.980 
like that and we're back to hard-boiled
there

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:28.990 
there

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:31.800 
there
normal<00:04:29.680> boiled<00:04:30.250> ER<00:04:30.340> mode<00:04:30.550> there's<00:04:31.510> this

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:31.810 
normal boiled ER mode there's this

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:35.010 
normal boiled ER mode there's this
little<00:04:32.560> stain<00:04:33.130> thing<00:04:33.520> I<00:04:33.850> mean<00:04:34.330> you<00:04:34.390> can<00:04:34.690> sit<00:04:34.930> in

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:35.020 
little stain thing I mean you can sit in

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:37.770 
little stain thing I mean you can sit in
the<00:04:35.080> front<00:04:35.260> but<00:04:35.410> it<00:04:35.530> still<00:04:35.710> wobbles<00:04:36.210> and<00:04:37.210> it

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:37.780 
the front but it still wobbles and it

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:39.810 
the front but it still wobbles and it
you<00:04:38.260> can<00:04:38.500> sit<00:04:38.770> in<00:04:38.830> the<00:04:38.979> front<00:04:39.010> too<00:04:39.490> but<00:04:39.700> it's

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:39.820 
you can sit in the front too but it's

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:43.110 
you can sit in the front too but it's
meant<00:04:40.120> for<00:04:40.210> the<00:04:40.450> back<00:04:40.720> wheel<00:04:41.790> if<00:04:42.790> you<00:04:42.910> just

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:43.120 
meant for the back wheel if you just

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:44.880 
meant for the back wheel if you just
shoved<00:04:43.720> the<00:04:43.870> back<00:04:44.050> wheel<00:04:44.290> in<00:04:44.500> there<00:04:44.620> it<00:04:44.710> fits

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:44.890 
shoved the back wheel in there it fits

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:46.680 
shoved the back wheel in there it fits
nice<00:04:45.220> and<00:04:45.460> tight<00:04:45.640> and<00:04:45.910> then<00:04:46.060> it<00:04:46.180> provides<00:04:46.419> a

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:46.690 
nice and tight and then it provides a

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:50.310 
nice and tight and then it provides a
lot<00:04:46.810> of<00:04:47.310> stability<00:04:48.690> so<00:04:49.690> you<00:04:49.750> can<00:04:49.930> do<00:04:50.050> that<00:04:50.169> if

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:50.320 
lot of stability so you can do that if

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:52.790 
lot of stability so you can do that if
you'd<00:04:50.470> like

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:52.800 

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:55.080 

basically<00:04:53.800> how<00:04:54.190> I'm<00:04:54.310> going<00:04:54.490> to<00:04:54.580> do<00:04:54.760> this<00:04:54.880> is<00:04:55.060> I

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:55.090 
basically how I'm going to do this is I

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:58.380 
basically how I'm going to do this is I
have<00:04:55.360> cycle<00:04:55.780> and<00:04:55.870> Joker<00:04:56.130> right<00:04:57.130> here<00:04:57.520> with<00:04:58.270> his

00:04:58.380 --> 00:04:58.390 
have cycle and Joker right here with his

00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:02.210 
have cycle and Joker right here with his
epic<00:04:58.720> cape<00:04:59.880> cycle<00:05:00.880> and<00:05:01.000> Joker<00:05:01.210> does<00:05:01.570> not<00:05:01.750> have

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:02.220 
epic cape cycle and Joker does not have

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:05.520 
epic cape cycle and Joker does not have
bike<00:05:03.220> holding<00:05:03.580> hands<00:05:03.910> nor<00:05:04.810> did<00:05:05.080> this<00:05:05.289> come

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:05.530 
bike holding hands nor did this come

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:08.040 
bike holding hands nor did this come
