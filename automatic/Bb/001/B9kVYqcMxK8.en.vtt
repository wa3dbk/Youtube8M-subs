whoever his progeny is well I mean it's

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.330 
whoever his progeny is well I mean it's
when<00:01:15.540> he<00:01:15.630> says<00:01:15.869> and<00:01:16.080> my<00:01:16.409> sister<00:01:16.860> has<00:01:17.040> it<00:01:17.070> which

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
when he says and my sister has it which

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:18.830 
when he says and my sister has it which
is<00:01:17.490> of<00:01:17.610> course<00:01:17.820> from<00:01:18.000> from<00:01:18.479> Return<00:01:18.720> of<00:01:18.750> the

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
is of course from from Return of the

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.050 
is of course from from Return of the
Jedi<00:01:18.900> the<00:01:19.860> fact<00:01:20.100> that<00:01:20.250> they<00:01:20.400> use<00:01:20.640> that<00:01:20.850> line

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
Jedi the fact that they use that line

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.760 
Jedi the fact that they use that line
makes<00:01:21.330> me<00:01:21.509> wonder<00:01:21.750> if<00:01:21.869> ley<00:01:22.080> is<00:01:22.229> gonna<00:01:22.409> be<00:01:22.590> more

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
makes me wonder if ley is gonna be more

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.350 
makes me wonder if ley is gonna be more
of<00:01:22.830> a<00:01:22.920> central<00:01:23.220> figure<00:01:23.460> in<00:01:23.549> this<00:01:23.700> than<00:01:24.030> I

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
of a central figure in this than I

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:25.999 
of a central figure in this than I
figured<00:01:24.420> or<00:01:24.930> maybe<00:01:25.259> it's<00:01:25.439> just<00:01:25.470> to<00:01:25.650> emphasize

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
figured or maybe it's just to emphasize

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:27.350 
figured or maybe it's just to emphasize
the<00:01:26.189> point<00:01:26.220> that<00:01:26.490> it<00:01:26.610> runs<00:01:26.759> strong<00:01:27.060> in<00:01:27.119> his

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
the point that it runs strong in his

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.539 
the point that it runs strong in his
family<00:01:27.960> and<00:01:28.170> so<00:01:28.619> Leia's<00:01:28.979> they're<00:01:29.250> gonna<00:01:29.369> talk

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
family and so Leia's they're gonna talk

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.069 
family and so Leia's they're gonna talk
about<00:01:29.640> Han<00:01:29.880> and<00:01:30.030> Leia's<00:01:30.240> kids<00:01:30.540> a<00:01:30.780> little<00:01:30.960> bit

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
about Han and Leia's kids a little bit

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:32.929 
about Han and Leia's kids a little bit
so<00:01:31.470> that's<00:01:31.650> an<00:01:31.770> option<00:01:31.890> to<00:01:32.130> look<00:01:32.549> from<00:01:32.909> that

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
so that's an option to look from that

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.240 
so that's an option to look from that
first<00:01:33.299> shot<00:01:33.659> of<00:01:33.900> the<00:01:33.990> crash<00:01:34.229> Star<00:01:34.590> Destroyer<00:01:34.979> I

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
first shot of the crash Star Destroyer I

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:36.890 
first shot of the crash Star Destroyer I
was<00:01:36.150> home<00:01:36.420> again

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
was home again

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
then of course they ended it perfectly

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:31.280 
then of course they ended it perfectly
if<00:02:29.460> this<00:02:29.580> was<00:02:29.730> any<00:02:29.880> other<00:02:29.970> franchise<00:02:30.600> the

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
absolute ending of the trailer might

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:33.800 
absolute ending of the trailer might
have<00:02:32.700> been<00:02:32.790> considered<00:02:33.210> a<00:02:33.240> little<00:02:33.420> bit<00:02:33.510> cheesy
