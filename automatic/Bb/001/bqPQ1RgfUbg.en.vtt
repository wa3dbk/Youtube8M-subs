quadrant standard I know this is not the

to see these quadrant benchmarks so

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.229 
to see these quadrant benchmarks so
we'll<00:00:41.100> go<00:00:41.219> ahead<00:00:41.399> and<00:00:41.610> go<00:00:41.879> into<00:00:42.149> the

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
on this samsung galaxy note 2 so that

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.869 
on this samsung galaxy note 2 so that
the<00:00:48.660> icons<00:00:49.200> aren't<00:00:49.469> as<00:00:49.680> large<00:00:50.010> and<00:00:50.399> you<00:00:50.640> get<00:00:50.760> to

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
the icons aren't as large and you get to

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.410 
the icons aren't as large and you get to
utilize<00:00:51.149> some<00:00:51.600> more<00:00:51.870> of<00:00:52.140> this<00:00:52.520> area<00:00:53.520> on<00:00:53.760> the

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
utilize some more of this area on the

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.220 
utilize some more of this area on the
screen<00:00:54.719> here<00:00:54.989> you<00:00:55.559> can<00:00:55.620> see<00:00:55.920> the<00:00:56.360> HTC<00:00:57.360> One<00:00:57.570> fits

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
screen here you can see the HTC One fits

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.250 
screen here you can see the HTC One fits
well<00:00:58.500> within<00:00:58.800> the<00:00:59.100> boundaries<00:00:59.809> of<00:01:00.809> that

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
well within the boundaries of that

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:02.709 
well within the boundaries of that
device

00:01:02.709 --> 00:01:02.719 
device

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:06.859 
device
first<00:01:03.719> we'll<00:01:04.790> go<00:01:05.790> ahead<00:01:05.880> and<00:01:06.000> find<00:01:06.600> it

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
first we'll go ahead and find it

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:10.330 
first we'll go ahead and find it
quadrant<00:01:07.680> standard<00:01:07.860> is<00:01:08.490> what<00:01:09.030> we're<00:01:09.210> running

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:10.340 
quadrant standard is what we're running

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:22.060 
quadrant standard is what we're running
or<00:01:11.340> quadrant<00:01:11.939> advanced<00:01:12.360> actually

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:22.070 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:24.760 

now<00:01:22.610> these<00:01:22.820> aren't<00:01:23.090> in<00:01:23.270> airplane<00:01:23.780> mode<00:01:23.810> they

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:24.770 
now these aren't in airplane mode they

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:26.470 
now these aren't in airplane mode they
kind<00:01:24.980> of<00:01:25.010> have<00:01:25.160> the<00:01:25.280> same<00:01:25.490> email<00:01:25.970> addresses

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:26.480 
kind of have the same email addresses

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:29.770 
kind of have the same email addresses
sync<00:01:26.990> to<00:01:27.170> them<00:01:27.670> that<00:01:28.670> would<00:01:28.790> probably<00:01:29.090> play<00:01:29.750> a

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:29.780 
sync to them that would probably play a

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:33.610 
sync to them that would probably play a
really<00:01:30.320> small<00:01:30.980> factor<00:01:32.170> we'll<00:01:33.170> go<00:01:33.320> ahead<00:01:33.440> and

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:33.620 
really small factor we'll go ahead and

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:37.390 
really small factor we'll go ahead and
run<00:01:34.010> this<00:01:34.630> probably<00:01:35.630> twice<00:01:36.230> the<00:01:36.950> first<00:01:37.190> time

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:37.400 
run this probably twice the first time

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:38.980 
run this probably twice the first time
I'll<00:01:37.640> let<00:01:37.790> it<00:01:37.850> run<00:01:38.060> all<00:01:38.090> the<00:01:38.330> way<00:01:38.390> through<00:01:38.750> and

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:38.990 
I'll let it run all the way through and

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:41.590 
I'll let it run all the way through and
then<00:01:39.890> the<00:01:40.130> second<00:01:40.700> time<00:01:40.910> I'll<00:01:41.240> just

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:41.600 
then the second time I'll just

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:56.060 
then the second time I'll just
fast-forward<00:01:42.130> right<00:01:43.130> to<00:01:43.310> the<00:01:43.430> results

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.300 

now<00:01:56.640> I<00:01:56.670> really<00:01:57.120> like<00:01:57.480> the<00:01:58.020> amount<00:01:58.290> of<00:01:58.440> area<00:01:59.010> you

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
now I really like the amount of area you

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.460 
now I really like the amount of area you
have<00:01:59.490> on<00:01:59.790> the<00:02:00.000> screen<00:02:00.780> with<00:02:00.960> the<00:02:00.990> Samsung

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:01.470 
have on the screen with the Samsung

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:03.890 
have on the screen with the Samsung
Galaxy<00:02:01.620> Note<00:02:01.950> 2<00:02:02.340> if<00:02:02.640> you<00:02:02.760> do<00:02:02.970> change<00:02:03.210> the<00:02:03.450> LCD

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:03.900 
Galaxy Note 2 if you do change the LCD

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:06.020 
Galaxy Note 2 if you do change the LCD
density<00:02:04.410> down<00:02:04.680> in<00:02:05.010> the<00:02:05.130> build<00:02:05.310> prop<00:02:05.610> so<00:02:05.880> that

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
density down in the build prop so that

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.999 
density down in the build prop so that
you<00:02:06.120> can<00:02:06.240> make<00:02:06.390> use<00:02:06.600> of<00:02:06.630> that<00:02:06.900> versus<00:02:07.770> just

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
you can make use of that versus just

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:09.830 
you can make use of that versus just
having<00:02:08.250> really<00:02:08.280> large<00:02:08.700> icons<00:02:09.210> because<00:02:09.570> the

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
having really large icons because the

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.720 
having really large icons because the
screen<00:02:10.080> resolution<00:02:10.259> the<00:02:10.800> note<00:02:10.979> 2<00:02:11.160> is<00:02:11.430> lower

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
screen resolution the note 2 is lower

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:15.590 
screen resolution the note 2 is lower
than<00:02:12.390> the<00:02:12.630> HTC<00:02:13.380> One<00:02:13.860> I<00:02:14.190> have<00:02:15.030> been<00:02:15.210> using<00:02:15.420> the

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:15.600 
than the HTC One I have been using the

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:19.760 
than the HTC One I have been using the

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
really like having a large device this

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.720 
really like having a large device this
seems<00:02:27.660> to<00:02:27.780> work<00:02:27.960> really<00:02:27.990> well<00:02:28.290> for<00:02:28.530> me<00:02:28.830> so<00:02:28.980> the

there<00:03:06.720> just<00:03:07.500> go<00:03:07.620> ahead<00:03:07.709> and<00:03:08.070> run<00:03:08.400> them<00:03:08.550> one

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
there just go ahead and run them one

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:17.600 
there just go ahead and run them one
