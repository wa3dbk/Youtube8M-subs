00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.900
 Hello! I'm Chris from Applied Bolting 

00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:08.770 position:92%
 In this workshop we will talk about the place of the rose, the DTI, and the direction of the screw set [ 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:26.030 position:77%
 There are two methods of normal ways to install DDT 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:32.230 position:91%
 The traditional method is to place the rose bumps directly against the nail head and attach the nut 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:37.200 position:91%
 The most common method these days is to put the DTI rose under the managed element 

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:43.110 position:80%
 This is a DD then a flat rose and then a nut, one person with one hook on the side of the nut 

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:45.850 position:89%
 The first thing we will do is assemble by the nut 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.180 position:72%
 It is when we move (fasten) the nut to tighten the screw 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:55.090 position:92%
 We will put the DTI flower in this place, and this is identical to the B drawing on the Help page. 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:02.570 position:56%
 So the screw is placed through the steel link 

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:07.900 position:92%
 Then the rose of the DTI protrudes outward away from the crucifix 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.470 position:86%
 Because the steel is soft and the rose bumps are more solid (for heat treatment). 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:18.380 position:88%
 Then according to the specifications we will put the rose heat treatment against the bumps 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:23.360
 Under the managed element and then the nut 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:29.280 position:89%
 The more rigid rose (for heat treatment) prevents the managed element - in this case the nut - from grinding the protrusions 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:32.150
 Again screw through the steel link 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:36.960 position:67%
 The DTI on the thread protrudes outward 

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:41.530 position:63%
 Then the flat-treated flat rose 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:46.860
 Then the nut 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:49.010
 Another hole 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:51.070
 The DTI protrudes outward 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:59.590 position:78%
 Flat-treated flat rose and nut 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.670
 Now all the nails are in place 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:08.090 position:86%
 We will attach the screws from the center of the joint to the outside to make the steel plates on a constant connection 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:11.710 position:83%
 The crew will then attach the screws to each screw 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:15.190 position:78%
 According to figure B, the structure is from the side of the nut 

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:18.980 position:88%
 This can be seen as the method of installation by the managed element 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.680 position:73%
 Sometimes it is not possible to access the bus 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:26.490 position:92%
 There may be solid sections in the road blocking the access of the connecting device 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:29.740 position:88%
 Or that the architect wants to have all the heads of the nails out 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:36.620 position:92%
 With this in mind, we will put the DTI under the screw head, but we will hook the screw head 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:42.760 position:88%
 Now one of the reasons construction links are unique is that the head of the screw and nut 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:47.410 position:69%
 They have the same dimensions so they can be connected from either side 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:50.180
 So we will manage (bind) the screw head 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:57.350 position:77%
 We have a flat-treated flat rose between the managed element and the protrusions 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:01.070 position:81%
 Stretches against flat-treated heat-treated rose 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:06.530 position:66%
 We will enter this through the steel link and then the nut 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:11.670 position:75%
 In this method of installation, the screw head will be attached 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:18.510 position:88%
 Again one person with one hook but by the top of the screw. Installing the screw set in this way is acceptable 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:21.640
 Again we have the screw 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:27.410 position:81%
 Sander (hook) screw head. The flat rose prevents the grinding of protrusions 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:32.890 position:83%
 DTI bumps against the flat rose - during the steel link 

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:38.860
 Then the nut 

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:48.700 position:92%
 The screw and thermostatically treated shaft and then the DTI with the bulges against the flat rose - during the steel link 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:55.170
 Another nail 

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:56.970
 Now all the nails are in place 

00:03:56.990 --> 00:04:02.380 position:88%
 We will attach the screws from the center of the joint to the outside to make the steel plates on a constant connection 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:09.150 position:91%
 Then we will hook the side of the screw head to tighten all the screws 

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:14.330 position:86%
 And according to the specification of the structure of the drawing B (B) is the installation of the side of the nut 

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:22.570 position:83%
 We have DTI in terms of rotation and in this case the worker can see the flat surfaces and the squirting spray 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:27.900 position:92%
 If the nut side can not be reached, the LDT can be placed under the screw head to protect the flat leaf 

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:31.160 position:78%
 Again one person with one hook on the side of the nut 

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:34.990 position:88%
 The connection will continue until you see the release of the silicon (spray) or the surface of the protrusions 

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:36.880
 Now two important rules 

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:41.010 position:91%
 First, the DTI protrusions always face away from the core of the joint 

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:44.470 position:84%
 Second, it is not possible to rotate directly on the DTI protrusions 

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:49.920 position:81%
 It is always necessary to have a flat rose heat treatment between the managed element and the protrusions of the DTI 

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:53.380 position:89%
