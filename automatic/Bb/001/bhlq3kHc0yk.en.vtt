00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
to turned forward position and that's

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.720 
to turned forward position and that's
you<00:00:13.500> see<00:00:15.440> anything<00:00:16.440> you<00:00:16.560> would<00:00:16.680> think<00:00:16.890> on<00:00:17.190> or

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
you would see that we could do with

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.840 
you would see that we could do with
chins<00:00:19.320> and<00:00:19.500> or<00:00:19.650> trying<00:00:20.010> or<00:00:21.980> you<00:00:22.980> tell<00:00:23.279> me<00:00:23.550> I'm

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
assuming that's a bearing I'm looking

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:31.450 
assuming that's a bearing I'm looking
out<00:00:25.800> there<00:00:27.529> and<00:00:28.529> there's<00:00:28.680> part<00:00:28.980> numbers<00:00:29.340> and

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:31.460 
out there and there's part numbers and

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:34.790 
out there and there's part numbers and

if<00:01:14.640> the<00:01:14.790> car<00:01:14.970> was<00:01:15.210> now<00:01:15.360> in<00:01:15.540> Reverse<00:01:17.120> and<00:01:18.120> I<00:01:18.210> am

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
if the car was now in Reverse and I am

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.360 
if the car was now in Reverse and I am
hearing<00:01:18.810> grinding<00:01:19.500> but<00:01:19.620> it<00:01:19.740> is<00:01:19.860> definitely

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:20.370 
hearing grinding but it is definitely

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:25.010 
hearing grinding but it is definitely
coming<00:01:20.460> from<00:01:21.380> the<00:01:22.380> brake<00:01:22.620> disk<00:01:23.600> the<00:01:24.600> front

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
coming from the brake disk the front

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.690 
coming from the brake disk the front
wheels<00:01:25.200> will<00:01:25.470> seem<00:01:25.680> very<00:01:25.740> tight<00:01:26.160> on<00:01:26.370> the<00:01:26.460> front

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
wheels will seem very tight on the front

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.070 
wheels will seem very tight on the front
so<00:01:26.970> I<00:01:27.000> don't<00:01:27.210> think<00:01:27.360> there's<00:01:27.510> any<00:01:27.660> bearings

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080
