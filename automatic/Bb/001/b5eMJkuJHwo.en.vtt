00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
 Our beautiful lands are ravaged by our ruthless king. 

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.500
 And our people live under the guise of tyranny. 

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:18.500
 As long as I am king, disloyalty will be punished by death. 

00:00:19.001 --> 00:00:22.000
 There is no one who is afraid of you, my king. 

00:00:25.001 --> 00:00:29.000
 It wasn't always like this, there was a time when the world lived in peace, 

00:00:29.001 --> 00:00:33.000
 protected by warriors, and great powerful dragons. 

00:00:35.001 --> 00:00:41.000
 But enough stories, all we have to do now is hope that the dragon will be born again, 

00:00:41.001 --> 00:00:45.000
 and someone will rise to lead us to freedom. 

00:00:45.001 --> 00:00:47.000
 THE FIRST CHAPTER OF THE TRIAL TRILOGY 

00:00:48.001 --> 00:00:51.000
 I want back what was stolen. 

00:00:51.001 --> 00:00:53.000
 I am vulnerable without it. 

00:00:56.001 --> 00:01:02.000
 Your day will come once, Eragon. And you decide for yourself what life you will lead. 

00:01:02.001 --> 00:01:04.000
 You're the only one who can save us. 

00:01:04.001 --> 00:01:07.000
 I know your story is real. 

00:01:07.001 --> 00:01:09.000
 You! You're the next dragon rider. 

00:01:12.501 --> 00:01:16.000
 When they find that the legend is true, they will challenge me. 

00:01:18.001 --> 00:01:21.000
 The King will not rest until your dragon is killed. 

00:01:22.001 --> 00:01:26.000
 Sort my army, don't let anyone live. 

00:01:27.001 --> 00:01:29.000
 You're helping me, otherwise the king will kill you too. 

00:01:30.001 --> 00:01:33.000
 He'll kill us all if you don't survive. 

00:01:34.001 --> 00:01:39.000
 Magic comes from dragons, riders who command them. 

00:01:40.001 --> 00:01:45.000
 Be strong Eragon, they will follow you where you want. 

00:01:46.001 --> 00:01:51.000
 One bad move, one bad decision, and everything is lost! 

00:01:52.001 --> 00:01:54.000
 I'm a rider, and I say we're going! 

00:01:55.001 --> 00:02:01.000
 Tell our people that the battle we have prepared has come to us. 

00:02:02.001 --> 00:02:05.000
 Let's fight as one! 

00:02:20.001 --> 00:02:21.500
