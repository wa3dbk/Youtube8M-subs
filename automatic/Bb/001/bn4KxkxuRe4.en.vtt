league<00:01:13.100> and<00:01:13.310> if<00:01:13.460> you<00:01:13.580> remember<00:01:13.880> Chamberlain

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:14.630 
league and if you remember Chamberlain

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:16.810 
league and if you remember Chamberlain
he<00:01:15.140> would<00:01:15.320> move<00:01:15.470> all<00:01:15.770> around<00:01:16.009> the<00:01:16.399> free-throw

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:16.820 
he would move all around the free-throw

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:18.790 
he would move all around the free-throw
line<00:01:16.850> trying<00:01:17.450> to<00:01:17.540> get<00:01:17.720> the<00:01:17.899> correct<00:01:18.229> angle<00:01:18.530> you

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:18.800 
line trying to get the correct angle you

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:21.190 
line trying to get the correct angle you
know<00:01:18.950> Shaq's<00:01:19.670> game<00:01:19.970> is<00:01:20.180> a<00:01:20.210> power<00:01:20.509> game<00:01:20.899> with

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:21.200 
know Shaq's game is a power game with

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:24.190 
know Shaq's game is a power game with
dominance<00:01:22.160> is<00:01:22.310> not<00:01:22.550> one<00:01:22.820> of<00:01:22.850> the<00:01:23.090> nest<00:01:23.360> so

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:24.200 
dominance is not one of the nest so

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.200 
dominance is not one of the nest so
therefore<00:01:24.410> he<00:01:24.649> has<00:01:24.890> a<00:01:24.920> difficult<00:01:25.250> time<00:01:25.580> coming

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:26.210 
therefore he has a difficult time coming

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:29.010 
therefore he has a difficult time coming
down<00:01:26.240> to<00:01:26.600> the<00:01:26.720> finesse<00:01:27.110> game
