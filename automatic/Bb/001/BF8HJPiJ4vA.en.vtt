than American cars because of the

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:08.360 
diversity that they have for example

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:11.060 
diversity that they have for example
most<00:01:09.360> American<00:01:09.840> cars<00:01:10.110> might<00:01:10.350> be<00:01:10.500> really<00:01:10.710> good

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
in the engine area with the horsepower

in the engine area with the horsepower
and<00:01:14.370> torque<00:01:14.760> but<00:01:15.390> they're<00:01:15.600> not<00:01:15.780> overall<00:01:16.320> using

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
and torque but they're not overall using

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.370 
and torque but they're not overall using
everything<00:01:17.100> that<00:01:17.430> a<00:01:17.460> car<00:01:17.790> can<00:01:17.970> give<00:01:18.380> for

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
everything that a car can give for

example with the wheels and tires set up

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.040 
example with the wheels and tires set up
or<00:01:21.390> the<00:01:21.479> handling<00:01:22.020> and<00:01:22.430> I<00:01:23.430> just<00:01:24.360> like<00:01:24.570> the

car can do yes there's I mostly do auto
cross<00:01:31.440> racing<00:01:31.950> and<00:01:32.190> there's<00:01:32.910> a<00:01:33.060> lot<00:01:33.300> of<00:01:33.390> muscle

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
cross racing and there's a lot of muscle

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.749 
cross racing and there's a lot of muscle
cars<00:01:33.900> that<00:01:34.170> autocross<00:01:34.710> surprisingly<00:01:35.460> a<00:01:35.580> lot

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
cars that autocross surprisingly a lot

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:39.650 
cars that autocross surprisingly a lot
of<00:01:35.910> Mustangs<00:01:36.450> and<00:01:36.750> at<00:01:37.229> the<00:01:37.979> last<00:01:38.190> event<00:01:39.119> there

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:39.660 
of Mustangs and at the last event there

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:47.359 
of Mustangs and at the last event there
was<00:01:39.869> a<00:01:41.210> 1965<00:01:43.160> factory<00:01:44.600> Cobra<00:01:45.600> and<00:01:46.160> he<00:01:47.160> had<00:01:47.280> a

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
was a 1965 factory Cobra and he had a

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:51.200 
was a 1965 factory Cobra and he had a
pretty<00:01:47.850> good<00:01:48.090> setup<00:01:48.420> trailered<00:01:49.320> in<00:01:50.210> race

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
pretty good setup trailered in race

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.780 
pretty good setup trailered in race
tires<00:01:51.540> and<00:01:51.990> I<00:01:52.229> beat<00:01:52.500> him<00:01:52.770> by<00:01:53.040> about<00:01:53.340> half<00:01:53.640> a

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
tires and I beat him by about half a

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.510 
tires and I beat him by about half a
second<00:01:54.240> so<00:01:55.200> it<00:01:55.229> was<00:01:55.350> pretty<00:01:55.860> happy<00:01:56.070> with<00:01:56.250> that

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
second so it was pretty happy with that

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.930 
second so it was pretty happy with that
and<00:01:57.110> so<00:01:58.110> the<00:01:58.380> answer<00:01:59.070> to<00:01:59.430> the<00:01:59.549> next<00:01:59.580> question

00:01:59.930 --> 00:01:59.940 
and so the answer to the next question

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:02.740 
and so the answer to the next question
is<00:02:00.570> that<00:02:01.170> they<00:02:01.500> probably<00:02:01.740> want<00:02:02.070> some<00:02:02.250> revenge

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:02.750 
is that they probably want some revenge

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:05.660 
is that they probably want some revenge
since<00:02:03.750> I<00:02:03.930> have<00:02:04.170> the<00:02:04.320> first<00:02:04.530> leg<00:02:04.830> up<00:02:05.070> on<00:02:05.220> the

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
since I have the first leg up on the

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.859 
since I have the first leg up on the
muscle<00:02:06.000> cars<00:02:06.299> I<00:02:07.610> think<00:02:08.610> rednecks<00:02:09.239> are<00:02:09.540> a<00:02:09.600> lot

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
muscle cars I think rednecks are a lot

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:12.140 
muscle cars I think rednecks are a lot
like<00:02:10.049> muscle<00:02:10.560> cars<00:02:10.799> they're<00:02:11.400> kind<00:02:11.970> of<00:02:12.090> a

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
like muscle cars they're kind of a

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:14.750 
like muscle cars they're kind of a
one-trick<00:02:12.810> wonder<00:02:13.290> they're<00:02:14.070> good<00:02:14.310> at<00:02:14.459> one

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
one-trick wonder they're good at one

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.960 
one-trick wonder they're good at one
thing<00:02:14.790> and<00:02:15.799> not<00:02:16.799> good<00:02:17.130> at<00:02:17.280> everything<00:02:17.610> else

rear<00:02:51.830> wing<00:02:52.480> and<00:02:53.480> I<00:02:53.750> mostly<00:02:54.050> worked<00:02:54.380> on<00:02:54.530> my

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:54.920 
rear wing and I mostly worked on my

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:57.370 
rear wing and I mostly worked on my
suspension<00:02:55.550> mods<00:02:55.790> with<00:02:56.120> the<00:02:56.270> coilover<00:02:56.960> setup

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:57.380 
suspension mods with the coilover setup

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:01.180 
suspension mods with the coilover setup
and<00:02:58.510> bushings<00:02:59.510> and<00:02:59.660> braces<00:03:00.500> underneath<00:03:01.040> the

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:01.190 
and bushings and braces underneath the

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:04.960 
and bushings and braces underneath the
car<00:03:01.400> that<00:03:01.550> you<00:03:01.670> can't<00:03:01.910> see<00:03:02.180> and<00:03:02.560> then<00:03:03.560> I<00:03:04.010> have

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:04.970 
car that you can't see and then I have

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:08.020 
car that you can't see and then I have
the<00:03:05.660> advantage<00:03:06.500> of<00:03:07.130> the<00:03:07.520> forced<00:03:07.880> induction

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:08.030 
the advantage of the forced induction

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:11.620 
the advantage of the forced induction
under<00:03:08.960> the<00:03:09.110> hood<00:03:09.290> where<00:03:09.590> I<00:03:09.620> can<00:03:10.070> pull<00:03:11.030> away<00:03:11.210> and

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:11.630 
under the hood where I can pull away and

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:14.440 
under the hood where I can pull away and
further<00:03:12.050> in<00:03:12.290> the<00:03:12.380> straights<00:03:12.710> and<00:03:13.180> I<00:03:14.180> have<00:03:14.300> the

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:14.450 
further in the straights and I have the

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:17.050 
further in the straights and I have the
supercharged<00:03:15.020> setup<00:03:15.560> with<00:03:15.770> larger<00:03:16.430> injectors

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:17.060 
supercharged setup with larger injectors

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:20.200 
supercharged setup with larger injectors
and<00:03:17.090> fuel<00:03:17.510> pump<00:03:17.990> and<00:03:18.610> supporting<00:03:19.610> mods<00:03:19.790> for

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:20.210 
and fuel pump and supporting mods for

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:23.730 
and fuel pump and supporting mods for
that<00:03:20.390> and<00:03:21.140> so<00:03:21.950> there's<00:03:22.250> definitely<00:03:22.910> no<00:03:23.150> way

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:23.740 
that and so there's definitely no way

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:26.320 
that and so there's definitely no way
any<00:03:24.740> muscle<00:03:25.130> car<00:03:25.310> can<00:03:25.490> keep<00:03:25.670> up<00:03:25.850> with<00:03:26.000> me<00:03:26.180> in

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:26.330 
any muscle car can keep up with me in

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:28.990 
any muscle car can keep up with me in
the<00:03:26.420> streets
