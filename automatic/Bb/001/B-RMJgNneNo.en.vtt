after black play c6 which is quite

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.680 
after black play c6 which is quite

then<00:00:59.190> it<00:00:59.399> goes<00:00:59.609> up<00:00:59.760> the<00:00:59.850> queen<00:01:00.030> bee<00:01:00.180> three<00:01:00.260> so

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
then it goes up the queen bee three so

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.560 
then it goes up the queen bee three so
