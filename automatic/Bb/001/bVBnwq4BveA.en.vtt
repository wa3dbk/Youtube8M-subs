00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:20.470 
so ok once this gets to 100 I'm going to

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:21.870 
so ok once this gets to 100 I'm going to
guess<00:03:20.620> that<00:03:20.650> it's<00:03:20.920> going<00:03:21.010> to<00:03:21.070> ask<00:03:21.280> for<00:03:21.610> a<00:03:21.640> disk

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:21.880 
guess that it's going to ask for a disk

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:24.030 
guess that it's going to ask for a disk
and<00:03:22.209> now<00:03:22.420> we'll<00:03:22.660> rejoin<00:03:23.019> this<00:03:23.350> video<00:03:23.709> at<00:03:23.860> that

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:17.070 

I<00:04:15.310> thought<00:04:15.850> I<00:04:15.880> should<00:04:16.150> take<00:04:16.330> a<00:04:16.390> minute<00:04:16.750> to<00:04:16.900> just

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:17.080 
I thought I should take a minute to just

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:20.100 
I thought I should take a minute to just
make<00:04:17.590> a<00:04:17.620> note<00:04:17.950> that<00:04:18.280> for<00:04:19.209> some<00:04:19.420> reason<00:04:19.450> after<00:04:20.080> I

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:20.110 
make a note that for some reason after I

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:23.490 
make a note that for some reason after I
put<00:04:20.380> the<00:04:20.500> DVD<00:04:20.680> in<00:04:21.390> that<00:04:22.390> took<00:04:23.050> a<00:04:23.170> couple

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:23.500 
put the DVD in that took a couple

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:25.920 
put the DVD in that took a couple
minutes<00:04:23.650> for<00:04:24.070> the<00:04:24.280> DVD<00:04:24.820> to<00:04:25.030> actually<00:04:25.450> start<00:04:25.750> to

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:25.930 
minutes for the DVD to actually start to

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:28.410 
minutes for the DVD to actually start to
write<00:04:26.110> so<00:04:26.440> if<00:04:27.010> there's<00:04:27.250> no<00:04:27.430> need<00:04:27.670> to<00:04:27.700> panic<00:04:28.030> if

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:28.420 
write so if there's no need to panic if

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:31.200

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:37.570 
this was not going to start writing to

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:39.840 
this was not going to start writing to

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:42.850 
minutes it did it did start to write to

minded<00:05:37.600> not<00:05:37.630> too<00:05:37.930> long<00:05:38.140> ago<00:05:38.200> these<00:05:39.070> are<00:05:39.130> just

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:39.400

awesome<00:05:39.580> to<00:05:40.270> have<00:05:40.419> these<00:05:40.750> recovery<00:05:41.169> discs

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:44.020 

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:46.230 

but<00:05:44.590> what<00:05:44.770> I<00:05:44.800> mistakenly<00:05:45.490> thought<00:05:45.820> was<00:05:46.090> the

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:46.240 
but what I mistakenly thought was the

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:47.970 
but what I mistakenly thought was the
verification<00:05:46.960> the<00:05:47.110> first<00:05:47.350> time<00:05:47.590> I<00:05:47.620> don't<00:05:47.830> know

00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:47.980 
verification the first time I don't know

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:50.040 
verification the first time I don't know
what<00:05:48.220> that<00:05:48.430> was<00:05:48.700> that<00:05:48.730> went<00:05:49.150> by<00:05:49.330> quickly<00:05:49.660> but

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:50.050 
what that was that went by quickly but

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:52.560 
what that was that went by quickly but
now<00:05:50.200> it's<00:05:50.470> saying<00:05:51.370> file<00:05:51.640> verification<00:05:51.970> in

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:52.570 
now it's saying file verification in

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:54.450 
now it's saying file verification in
progress<00:05:53.110> was<00:05:53.350> still<00:05:53.530> one<00:05:53.650> just<00:05:53.920> one<00:05:54.160> of<00:05:54.280> two

00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:54.460 
progress was still one just one of two

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:59.100 
progress was still one just one of two
like<00:05:54.730> I<00:05:54.850> said<00:05:55.090> folks<00:05:55.410> long<00:05:56.610> process<00:05:57.610> here<00:05:58.110> I

00:05:59.100 --> 00:05:59.110 
like I said folks long process here I

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:01.920 
like I said folks long process here I
think<00:05:59.800> my<00:05:59.920> next<00:06:00.190> video<00:06:00.400> would<00:06:00.610> be<00:06:00.760> how<00:06:01.600> to<00:06:01.630> keep

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:01.930 
think my next video would be how to keep

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:04.410 
think my next video would be how to keep
yourself<00:06:02.290> busy<00:06:02.350> and<00:06:02.920> prevent<00:06:03.910> yourself<00:06:04.150> from

00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:04.420 
yourself busy and prevent yourself from

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:06.150 
yourself busy and prevent yourself from
dord<00:06:04.840> insane<00:06:05.230> while<00:06:05.590> you<00:06:05.710> making<00:06:06.040> your

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:06.160 
dord insane while you making your

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:10.200 
dord insane while you making your

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:10.210 
recovery disks so will will rejoin on

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:15.180 
recovery disks so will will rejoin on
this<00:06:10.390> soon<00:06:12.570> all<00:06:13.570> right<00:06:13.630> this<00:06:13.960> first<00:06:14.260> disk<00:06:15.010> has

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:15.190 
this soon all right this first disk has

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:18.090 
this soon all right this first disk has
been<00:06:15.370> finished<00:06:15.700> burning<00:06:16.770> we're<00:06:17.770> pretty<00:06:17.920> much

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:18.100

write to disk number two folks supposed
to<00:06:23.320> continue<00:06:23.590> this<00:06:23.860> video<00:06:24.130> it<00:06:24.370> would<00:06:24.430> be

00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:24.580 
to continue this video it would be

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:26.760 
to continue this video it would be
pretty<00:06:24.820> much<00:06:24.880> just<00:06:25.240> just<00:06:26.140> repeating<00:06:26.740> the

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:26.770 
pretty much just just repeating the

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:28.620 
pretty much just just repeating the
steps<00:06:27.130> that<00:06:27.370> we've<00:06:27.520> already<00:06:27.790> seen<00:06:28.180> for<00:06:28.390> just

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:28.630 
steps that we've already seen for just

00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:31.170 
steps that we've already seen for just
one<00:06:28.870> of<00:06:29.020> two<00:06:29.230> so<00:06:30.100> I<00:06:30.460> think<00:06:30.640> I'm<00:06:30.820> going<00:06:30.970> to<00:06:31.000> wrap

00:06:31.170 --> 00:06:31.180 
one of two so I think I'm going to wrap

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:33.420 
one of two so I think I'm going to wrap
it<00:06:31.360> up<00:06:31.450> right<00:06:31.660> here<00:06:32.050> I<00:06:32.260> mean<00:06:32.650> it's<00:06:32.950> basically

00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:33.430 
it up right here I mean it's basically

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:35.660 
it up right here I mean it's basically
just<00:06:33.760> repeating<00:06:34.390> the<00:06:34.420> steps<00:06:34.810> for<00:06:35.110> this<00:06:35.200> disk

00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:35.670 
just repeating the steps for this disk

00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:39.660 
just repeating the steps for this disk
and<00:06:37.290> you<00:06:38.290> know<00:06:38.410> click<00:06:38.740> and<00:06:38.890> finish<00:06:39.220> at<00:06:39.370> the<00:06:39.520> end

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:39.670 
and you know click and finish at the end

00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:42.000 
and you know click and finish at the end
so<00:06:40.090> I<00:06:40.540> think<00:06:41.230> we've<00:06:41.380> gotten<00:06:41.590> the<00:06:41.650> point<00:06:41.830> across

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:42.010 
so I think we've gotten the point across

00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:43.980 
so I think we've gotten the point across
