brighter<00:01:50.790> blush<00:01:51.210> than<00:01:51.450> probably<00:01:51.869> what<00:01:51.990> I

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
brighter blush than probably what I

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.560

would recommend for her as her makeup

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.359 
would recommend for her as her makeup
artist<00:01:54.720> for<00:01:55.079> just<00:01:55.259> a<00:01:55.350> regular<00:01:55.380> daytime<00:01:56.070> look

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
artist for just a regular daytime look

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:59.740 
artist for just a regular daytime look
but<00:01:57.090> again<00:01:57.420> we<00:01:57.960> have<00:01:58.140> to<00:01:58.259> go<00:01:58.350> a<00:01:58.380> little<00:01:58.530> bolder

00:01:59.740 --> 00:01:59.750 
but again we have to go a little bolder

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:02.300 
but again we have to go a little bolder
provided<00:02:00.750> this<00:02:00.930> color<00:02:01.229> harmonizes<00:02:01.950> with<00:02:02.159> the

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
provided this color harmonizes with the

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.510 
provided this color harmonizes with the
lip<00:02:02.549> I<00:02:02.899> think<00:02:03.899> that<00:02:04.020> you<00:02:04.110> are<00:02:04.140> on<00:02:04.439> target<00:02:05.009> in

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
lip I think that you are on target in

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:10.339 
lip I think that you are on target in
getting<00:02:06.479> noticed<00:02:06.899> and<00:02:07.970> standing<00:02:08.970> out<00:02:09.349> it's

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
getting noticed and standing out it's

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:12.160 
getting noticed and standing out it's
just<00:02:10.679> enough<00:02:10.890> line<00:02:11.099> of<00:02:11.250> definition

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:12.170 
just enough line of definition

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:14.170 
just enough line of definition
and<00:02:12.290> again<00:02:12.950> it's<00:02:13.130> always<00:02:13.460> easier<00:02:13.850> to<00:02:13.880> add

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:14.180 
and again it's always easier to add

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:16.150 
and again it's always easier to add
color<00:02:14.870> than<00:02:15.080> it<00:02:15.110> is<00:02:15.319> to<00:02:15.500> take<00:02:15.680> away<00:02:15.920> so<00:02:15.980> you
