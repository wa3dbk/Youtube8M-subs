00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
 http://www.dbsply.com 

00:00:08.334 --> 00:00:13.467
 White based simple package 

00:00:14.201 --> 00:00:17.734
 Modest appeal of 4ch control 

00:00:18.467 --> 00:00:22.567
 The bottom of the box can be used as a heliport 

00:00:34.434 --> 00:00:38.534
 It is relatively simple fixed 

00:00:45.334 --> 00:00:49.434
 The controller was taped firmly in the back 

00:00:53.667 --> 00:00:58.667
 Mode 1 reason, forward / reverse / left / right rotation with left / up / down / left / right slide with right 

00:01:14.967 --> 00:01:19.967
 Instructions and accessories were included 

00:01:40.967 --> 00:01:45.967
 It is a manual of kind contents of all eight pages 

00:01:49.967 --> 00:01:54.967
 Then take out the body 

00:02:07.701 --> 00:02:12.701
 Protected by thick double-sided tape with cushion 

00:02:13.967 --> 00:02:18.967
 The machine is very simple 

00:02:23.367 --> 00:02:27.367
 A little complicated mechanism to control 4ch ... 

00:02:29.467 --> 00:02:33.467
 Hmm? What is this connector? Maybe a switch? 

00:02:42.367 --> 00:02:46.367
 Screwing is a bit bothersome, so one is still good 

00:02:49.301 --> 00:02:54.301
 6 AA batteries 

00:02:56.034 --> 00:03:00.101
 Hmm? Enter? 

00:03:00.834 --> 00:03:03.767
 The direction is right? 

00:03:06.534 --> 00:03:11.534
 After all, it is hard to put battery ... 

00:03:18.267 --> 00:03:23.267
 By the way, what is the controller of mode 1 as a toy helicopter 

00:03:24.401 --> 00:03:29.401
 Because you are used to a general 3ch toy helicopter controller? 

00:03:30.467 --> 00:03:35.467
 In other words, until now the throttle is on the left, but I can make it fly right, or worry a bit ... 

00:03:41.901 --> 00:03:46.901
 Well, after all, directly to this connector? 

00:04:00.734 --> 00:04:05.734
 It is a little bother to pull this out ... 

00:04:09.434 --> 00:04:14.434
 It has nothing to do with charging, but this model, the tail propeller is dummy 

00:04:14.901 --> 00:04:20.934
 Of course it doesn't turn because it's just an ornament. 

00:04:24.067 --> 00:04:29.067
 I'm glad I came with the USB cable ... 

00:04:29.934 --> 00:04:34.000
 After all, you plug directly into this connector, right? 

00:04:34.934 --> 00:04:39.934
 Moreover, it is difficult to understand this connector ... 

00:04:45.501 --> 00:04:48.734
 The detailed report of this video is also done by HP
