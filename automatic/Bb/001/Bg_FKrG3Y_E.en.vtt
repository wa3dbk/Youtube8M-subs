move<00:04:05.590> it<00:04:05.709> over<00:04:05.769> to<00:04:06.099> high<00:04:06.430> cut<00:04:06.760> this<00:04:07.269> will<00:04:07.450> just

00:04:07.559 --> 00:04:07.569 
move it over to high cut this will just

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:09.390 
move it over to high cut this will just
help<00:04:07.659> tailor<00:04:08.170> the<00:04:08.349> sound<00:04:08.560> a<00:04:08.680> little<00:04:09.010> bit<00:04:09.159> more

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:09.400 
help tailor the sound a little bit more

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:11.160 
help tailor the sound a little bit more
so<00:04:09.579> you're<00:04:09.730> hearing<00:04:10.090> what<00:04:10.599> you<00:04:10.690> need<00:04:10.840> to<00:04:10.989> more
