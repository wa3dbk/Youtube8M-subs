okay<00:00:01.319> we're<00:00:01.560> going<00:00:01.650> to<00:00:01.709> show<00:00:01.800> you<00:00:02.040> how<00:00:02.310> to<00:00:02.340> do

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:02.730 
okay we're going to show you how to do

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:08.839 
okay we're going to show you how to do
the<00:00:03.240> timing<00:00:03.720> on<00:00:03.870> a<00:00:04.339> 1993<00:00:05.930> Chevy<00:00:06.930> k<00:00:07.370> 1500<00:00:08.370> pickup

00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:08.849 
the timing on a 1993 Chevy k 1500 pickup

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:14.390 
the timing on a 1993 Chevy k 1500 pickup
350<00:00:09.690> engine<00:00:10.129> 5.7<00:00:11.129> liter<00:00:11.629> we<00:00:12.629> just<00:00:13.129> put<00:00:14.129> a<00:00:14.160> new

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
350 engine 5.7 liter we just put a new

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.080 
350 engine 5.7 liter we just put a new
gasket<00:00:14.910> on<00:00:15.719> the<00:00:15.839> manifold<00:00:16.730> because<00:00:17.730> of<00:00:17.880> the

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
gasket on the manifold because of the

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.109 
gasket on the manifold because of the
water<00:00:18.720> fitting<00:00:19.170> that<00:00:19.320> corrodes<00:00:19.939> so<00:00:20.939> the

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
water fitting that corrodes so the

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:23.210 
water fitting that corrodes so the
correct<00:00:21.420> we<00:00:21.570> set<00:00:21.810> the<00:00:21.960> timing<00:00:22.439> on<00:00:22.619> this<00:00:22.890> motor

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
correct we set the timing on this motor

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.990 
correct we set the timing on this motor
it's<00:00:23.880> going<00:00:24.060> to<00:00:24.119> be<00:00:24.300> set<00:00:24.599> at<00:00:24.779> 0<00:00:25.140> degrees<00:00:26.000> which

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
it's going to be set at 0 degrees which

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.510 
it's going to be set at 0 degrees which
means<00:00:28.400> your<00:00:29.400> pointer<00:00:30.800> is<00:00:31.800> going<00:00:32.099> to<00:00:32.160> be<00:00:32.280> kind

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
means your pointer is going to be kind

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.160 
means your pointer is going to be kind
of<00:00:32.610> hard<00:00:32.820> to<00:00:32.940> see<00:00:33.150> down<00:00:33.420> here<00:00:33.450> let's<00:00:33.810> see<00:00:33.990> if<00:00:34.050> we

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
of hard to see down here let's see if we

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:39.160 
of hard to see down here let's see if we
can<00:00:34.350> see<00:00:34.560> it'll<00:00:34.770> just<00:00:35.010> flash<00:00:35.250> light<00:00:37.280> okay

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:39.170 
can see it'll just flash light okay

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:41.290 
can see it'll just flash light okay
there<00:00:40.170> we<00:00:40.290> go

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:41.300 
there we go

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:46.730 
there we go
no<00:00:42.890> even<00:00:43.890> get<00:00:44.040> the<00:00:44.750> sucker<00:00:45.750> down<00:00:46.020> here<00:00:46.350> you<00:00:46.590> can

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:46.740 
no even get the sucker down here you can

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:50.270 
no even get the sucker down here you can
barely<00:00:47.040> see<00:00:47.400> it<00:00:47.430> with<00:00:47.820> the<00:00:48.030> camera<00:00:48.740> phone<00:00:49.740> okay

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
barely see it with the camera phone okay

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:51.590 
barely see it with the camera phone okay
you're<00:00:50.430> going<00:00:50.520> to<00:00:50.580> see<00:00:50.790> your<00:00:51.030> timing

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
you're going to see your timing

you're going to see your timing
indicator<00:00:52.080> indicator<00:00:52.740> looks<00:00:53.040> like<00:00:53.220> a<00:00:53.250> fork

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
indicator indicator looks like a fork

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.150 
indicator indicator looks like a fork
it's<00:00:53.910> got<00:00:54.090> teeth<00:00:54.390> on<00:00:54.630> it<00:00:54.810> the<00:00:55.320> deepest<00:00:55.860> groove

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
it's got teeth on it the deepest groove

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:01.490 
it's got teeth on it the deepest groove
is<00:00:56.570> your<00:00:57.570> zero<00:00:57.990> setting<00:00:59.210> right<00:01:00.210> now<00:01:00.420> the<00:01:00.500> line

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
is your zero setting right now the line

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.549 
is your zero setting right now the line
on<00:01:01.770> the<00:01:01.950> crank<00:01:02.340> shafts<00:01:03.049> right<00:01:04.049> at<00:01:04.170> the<00:01:04.289> top<00:01:04.530> so

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
on the crank shafts right at the top so

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.289 
on the crank shafts right at the top so
you<00:01:04.799> can't<00:01:05.070> see<00:01:05.280> it<00:01:05.399> but<00:01:05.489> you'll<00:01:05.729> find<00:01:05.880> a<00:01:06.060> line

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
you can't see it but you'll find a line

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.690 
you can't see it but you'll find a line
on<00:01:06.570> your<00:01:06.750> crankshaft<00:01:07.109> mark<00:01:07.649> it<00:01:07.799> with<00:01:07.950> a<00:01:07.979> silver

marker<00:01:09.240> or<00:01:09.359> a<00:01:09.420> white<00:01:09.689> marker<00:01:10.109> so<00:01:10.259> you<00:01:10.350> can<00:01:10.500> see

00:01:10.639 --> 00:01:10.649 
marker or a white marker so you can see

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:14.660 
marker or a white marker so you can see
the<00:01:10.799> line<00:01:11.009> and<00:01:11.390> then<00:01:12.390> your<00:01:12.600> timing<00:01:13.049> plate<00:01:13.670> will

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
the line and then your timing plate will

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.590 
the line and then your timing plate will
have<00:01:14.850> a<00:01:14.909> deep<00:01:15.210> groove<00:01:15.479> is<00:01:15.719> where<00:01:15.929> the<00:01:16.109> zero<00:01:16.920> is

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:17.600 
have a deep groove is where the zero is

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:20.749 
have a deep groove is where the zero is
you<00:01:18.600> can't<00:01:18.869> see<00:01:19.109> it<00:01:19.229> on<00:01:19.350> yours<00:01:19.950> clean<00:01:20.340> it<00:01:20.520> to

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
you can't see it on yours clean it to

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.249 
you can't see it on yours clean it to
where<00:01:20.850> you<00:01:20.909> can<00:01:20.969> see<00:01:21.210> where<00:01:21.390> the<00:01:21.479> zero<00:01:21.749> is<00:01:21.960> and

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
where you can see where the zero is and

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:26.260 
where you can see where the zero is and
it'll<00:01:22.350> be<00:01:22.619> the<00:01:23.130> deepest<00:01:23.929> fork<00:01:24.929> looking<00:01:25.710> groove

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:26.270 
it'll be the deepest fork looking groove

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:30.770 
it'll be the deepest fork looking groove
cut<00:01:27.270> into<00:01:27.600> that<00:01:28.460> plate<00:01:29.460> down<00:01:29.729> there<00:01:30.060> there<00:01:30.630> it

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
cut into that plate down there there it

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.649 
cut into that plate down there there it
is<00:01:30.929> right<00:01:31.079> there<00:01:31.939> kind<00:01:32.939> of<00:01:32.999> hard<00:01:33.210> to<00:01:33.270> get<00:01:33.509> the

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
is right there kind of hard to get the

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.639 
is right there kind of hard to get the
phone<00:01:33.929> to<00:01:34.700> look<00:01:35.700> down<00:01:35.939> in<00:01:36.119> there<00:01:36.299> but<00:01:36.329> the

00:01:36.639 --> 00:01:36.649 
phone to look down in there but the

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:40.010 
phone to look down in there but the
little<00:01:37.649> black<00:01:37.859> plate<00:01:38.299> to<00:01:39.299> the<00:01:39.450> left<00:01:39.689> is<00:01:39.869> the

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
little black plate to the left is the

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.609 
little black plate to the left is the
deepest<00:01:40.409> groove<00:01:40.710> that's<00:01:40.920> where<00:01:41.130> the<00:01:41.280> zero<00:01:41.579> is

00:01:42.609 --> 00:01:42.619 
deepest groove that's where the zero is

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:46.309 
deepest groove that's where the zero is
okay<00:01:44.179> so<00:01:45.179> you're<00:01:45.329> going<00:01:45.479> to<00:01:45.509> set<00:01:45.749> your<00:01:45.869> timing

00:01:46.309 --> 00:01:46.319 
okay so you're going to set your timing

00:01:46.319 --> 00:01:50.239 
okay so you're going to set your timing
at<00:01:46.469> zero<00:01:47.399> degrees<00:01:48.740> first<00:01:49.740> you<00:01:49.950> need<00:01:50.100> to

00:01:50.239 --> 00:01:50.249 
at zero degrees first you need to

00:01:50.249 --> 00:01:52.209 
at zero degrees first you need to
disconnect<00:01:50.639> your<00:01:51.479> time<00:01:51.840> in<00:01:51.990> advance

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
motor started so what's going to happen

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:47.600 
motor started so what's going to happen
is<00:02:45.780> your<00:02:45.959> timing<00:02:46.350> is<00:02:46.470> actually<00:02:46.920> 20<00:02:47.250> degrees

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 
is your timing is actually 20 degrees

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:50.240 
is your timing is actually 20 degrees
advanced<00:02:48.209> but<00:02:48.780> you're<00:02:48.959> setting<00:02:49.290> your<00:02:49.440> timing

advanced but you're setting your timing

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:53.300 
advanced but you're setting your timing
indicator<00:02:50.820> at<00:02:51.000> zero<00:02:51.680> so<00:02:52.680> when<00:02:52.830> you<00:02:52.950> put<00:02:53.160> the

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
indicator at zero so when you put the

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
wire back on your ECM is going to

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:00.070 
wire back on your ECM is going to
advance<00:02:56.940> the<00:02:57.209> timing<00:02:57.720> back<00:02:58.260> up<00:02:58.560> to<00:02:58.740> 20<00:02:59.070> degrees

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:00.080

thing going on underneath the dash of
the<00:04:26.800> truck<00:04:26.830> we'll<00:04:27.280> figure<00:04:27.610> it<00:04:27.700> out<00:04:27.790> what<00:04:27.940> the

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:27.970 
the truck we'll figure it out what the

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:31.830 
the truck we'll figure it out what the
heck<00:04:28.180> of<00:04:28.330> that<00:04:28.480> is<00:04:28.630> you<00:04:30.390> may<00:04:31.390> be<00:04:31.420> something

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:31.840 
heck of that is you may be something

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:33.330 
heck of that is you may be something
that<00:04:31.990> new<00:04:32.110> with<00:04:32.230> the<00:04:32.350> old<00:04:32.530> alarm<00:04:32.860> system<00:04:33.310> that

that new with the old alarm system that
was<00:04:33.580> on<00:04:33.670> this<00:04:33.850> truck<00:04:34.120> now<00:04:34.870> you're<00:04:35.080> going<00:04:35.200> to

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:35.260 
was on this truck now you're going to

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:38.580 
was on this truck now you're going to
put<00:04:35.890> your<00:04:36.100> timing<00:04:36.870> advanced<00:04:37.870> connection<00:04:38.380> back

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:38.590 
put your timing advanced connection back

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:44.280
