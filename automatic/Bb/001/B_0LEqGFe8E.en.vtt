00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:03.870
 Hello youtube your Swedish 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:05.250
 capital of a hessen here warmly 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:06.930
 Welcome to a new modern warfare 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:08.849
 3 gameplay of mine I have for you 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:09.210
 today a sitemap on the bed was on 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:11.759
 begin 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:12.840
 Ansgar was 113 to seven here and me 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:14.190
 I'm still pretty good at this 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.509
 Remember day in mw3 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.400
 he actually started really well 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:19.380
 I had directly in the first round 100 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.670
 plus also falls on the map and bootleg 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.260
 I thought that could be a right 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.510
 awesome gameplay day will be the round one 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.519
 after that, however, it was rare 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.109
 experienced such a catastrophic day in mw3 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:29.670
 actually wanted the whole thing already 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.990
 finish again and then I have 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.000
 but again this bootleg believe 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.500
 found here has thought okay the 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.550
 My last chance in Wembley is now 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.260
 I do not want to play any of those 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.370
 let fall through the opponents 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.989
 That's why I have a bit 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.700
 starting with two have a bit too 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:43.800
 by the way, I have mine as well 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.539
 old bootlegs word from the old days again 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.370
 unpacked that is really so sick 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:48.690
 overboard when you enter the people 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.800
 little bit on the goal flag sport 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.170
 you want to meet that will you in the course 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.730
 this gameplay looks and that is 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.410
 People even ba with three minutes then 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.480
 relatively fast for me here 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.879
 really not so special offensive 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.530
 is not my record of playing 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.850
 is still at a minute 45 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.629
 I also have this gameplay on 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.250
 the hard disk 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.360
 but I have never uploaded it yet 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.950
 simply because it is in the 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.110
 no 100 plus gameplay of me because of me 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.580
 had me pour 60 in the end or so and 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.350
 no idea i think it should be like this 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.540
 in itself just not so exciting 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.580
 I always find it a great thing if 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.630
 the new moped and 100 plus 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.850
 create that is so happy that 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.960
 non-plus-ultra but such a simple one 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.950
 no one has not yet 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.020
 somehow then never really 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.189
 irritated by that, I do not know if I am 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.630
 maybe upload the whole thing 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:29.400
 Maybe you will not 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.860
 I would like to see you again today 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.329
 so a bit on the xbox reveal 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.159
 or on the new call of 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:36.420
 Duty goes trailer go down the whole 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:38.369
 is thus based a little distance 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.630
 considered because I wanted to first 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:41.400
 So my own opinion too 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.810
 form and that's why this video comes 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.610
 So a little late what I but 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.720
 I do not think that's bad at all 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.460
 first of all a little on this 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.780
 multimedia concept so i enter 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.490
 think it's that overall pretty cool 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.560
 Microsoft is trying his console 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:54.630
 continue to be attractive and 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.670
 it somehow tries out sony or 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.960
 from this very normal console 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.549
 to take off the concept 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.439
 I have to say that already on mine 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:03.270
 I actually use the current xbox 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:05.219
 quite often the feature of sky go 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:07.409
 watching football games I watch 

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:09.660
 think that could happen then 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:11.069
 so on the new xbox again 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.510
 continue and I could easily 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:13.110
 imagine that it will be one too 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:15.120
 or others 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:17.670
 additional program is what I then 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:19.140
 just about the xbox will use so for 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:20.400
 the very classic things like tv 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:22.290
 I'll watch or internet there then 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.310
 still the appropriate device 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.840
 I already go to the 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:26.130
 disposal had continued use 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:28.140
 but I could imagine 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:30.120
 that there are one or the other 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:32.130
 program will give what I just then 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:34.320
 yes about the xbox wii next to it 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:36.180
 to draw more rhine more often 

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:37.590
 and she has to say that overall 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:39.570
 actually what I always xbox 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:41.910
 has fascinated and convinces that 

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:44.880
 So this whole support concept was so 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:46.620
 For example, at the time I thought of myself as 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:47.910
 my xbox was broken and I a 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:49.709
 you were pretty happy about that 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:51.660
 that I get a new xbox directly 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:53.130
 and the whole thing went inside too 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:53.640
 from a week or so damn 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:55.380
 fast 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:57.270
 and if I'm so on this psn 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:58.620
 scandal of that time remember where it is 

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:00.480
 really took extremely long 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:02.100
 the online servers were available again 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:04.200
 I have to say that I like it 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:06.600
 me the concept of microsoft really 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:08.489
 much better and I had a big one 

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:09.840
 However, fear for the new xbox 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:11.610
 already that was the controller so 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:13.440
 It takes me forever to get involved 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:14.940
 controller I've got used to though 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:16.320
 always kind of a bit too 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:17.880
 as I have no console at all 

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:20.010
 and even gambled on the pc 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:23.100
 every now and then with friends from time to time 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:24.900
 xbox and ps2 or ps3 next to it already 

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:26.549
 played and always has me there 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:27.930
 the xbox controller is getting a little better 

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:30.180
 but I am right now 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:31.950
 so remember or remember 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:33.660
 also like me now 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:34.890
 I have to get used to the controller 

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:36.870
 Just say that I have the xbox 

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:38.310
 controller incredibly cool find there 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:40.680
 this then if I'm worried that 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:42.690
 the new controller maybe too much 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:43.950
 his novel precisely but when I will make him 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:45.480
 then I saw directly 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:46.830
 aroused the proportions are pretty 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:48.420
 similar in weight I could 

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:50.790
 Imagine that he is pretty much the same 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:52.200
 and in general from the size has me 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:54.480
 pretty much the whole thing 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:58.470
 and that's why I think these are 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:59.670
 then also fear the first 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:01.380
 announcements are in any case first 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:03.750
 wiped out at it maybe that way 

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:06.360
 can express myself and everyone on me 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:08.250
 pretty much just look forward to that 

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:10.230
 the new controller just the old one 

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:12.060
 I like that pretty much 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:13.470
 Definitely a good thing in any case 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:15.420
 maybe even to the servers 

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:15.900
 many people always have one 

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:17.549
 little 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:19.470
 especially with call of duty the problem that 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:21.209
 there are no dedicated servers out there 

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:21.959
 Number of xbox servers should be clear 

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:23.220
 increase 

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:24.930
 I know exactly if it is altogether 

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:26.620
 then synonymous for the new cod part of the 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:27.760
 chain server gives no idea 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:30.040
 Personally, I'm not that kind of person 

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:30.880
 great fan of so it quite quite 

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:32.380
 cool now with a new one 

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:34.000
 Internet line sometimes with also the 

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:34.479
 advantage over other players too 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.280
 to have 

00:04:34.479 --> 00:04:38.020
 through his direction that may be 

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:39.310
 a bit they sound but if you do 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:40.660
 really on a damn so long 

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:41.590
 has played bad internet line 

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:43.030
 then I just think so 

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:44.889
 a bit fair that you just then 

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:46.360
 now sometimes enjoy the advantage 

00:04:44.889 --> 00:04:47.949
 and even if I'm not particularly up 

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:48.940
 Post I'll just find a total 

00:04:47.949 --> 00:04:50.710
 the connection if you have a good one 

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:53.470
 is definitely okay for 

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:54.490
 call of duty and that's why I do not know 

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:55.840
 so if someone for example a 

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:57.520
 damn bad intent line has 

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:59.350
 then he will not be too server too 

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:00.460
 connect very well and therefore 

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:01.990
 I can not really agree with you 

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:03.580
 new coo detail none of the the chain 

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:06.039
 server is going but only really 

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:07.750
 the number of servers the microsoft to 

00:05:06.039 --> 00:05:09.820
 disposal is just what the door will be 

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:11.080
 connection in general also easy with 

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:12.550
 a host system a little bit more 

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:14.050
 would improve 

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:15.699
 but of course I am also aware that 

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:18.220
 many of you disagree 

00:05:15.699 --> 00:05:19.330
 so if yes this is my topic then 

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:21.010
 also finish a bit 

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:22.150
 a thing maybe still to the graphic 

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:24.490
 and now there's a bit of transition 

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:25.539
 to the cod part goes increasingly to 

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:27.490
 I can still do that in this one 

00:05:25.539 --> 00:05:29.289
 I would like to find a comment on trading 

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:30.789
 it's certainly cool that call of 

00:05:29.289 --> 00:05:32.380
 duty dasein a small graphic already 

00:05:30.789 --> 00:05:33.610
 but I will get synonymous 

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:35.830
 not so crucial 

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:37.030
 I think cod is graphic in mine 

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:38.800
 eyes do not decide how are you 

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:41.050
 since much more not about the game fun 

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:42.250
 that the game is so high end graphics moderately 

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:43.870
 looks like battlefield for 

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:45.220
 example the case is i find it 

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:46.780
 but very good for sports games 

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:48.010
 as for example much shortening there is looking forward 

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:49.539
 I really care about it like that 

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:51.250
 then also for the players 

00:05:49.539 --> 00:05:52.930
 Movements is implemented and also 

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:54.160
 of course for a game like gta 5 that 

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:55.660
 are the two games that I 

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:57.760
 I am most happy next to Assassin's 

00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:58.750
 creed where i really have to say straight 

00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:00.760
 these players with a really big one 

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:02.620
 environment also need another 

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:04.510
 bit better graphics and that's why 

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:06.789
 I really curious how then gta 

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:09.400
 5 but it will look like this one time 

00:06:06.789 --> 00:06:10.419
 little bit to the cod and to come 

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:12.460
 also to this trailer 

00:06:10.419 --> 00:06:14.440
 I believe the most important thing this 

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:16.419
 testified that he was trailer 

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:17.530
 mysterious that is so exciting now 

00:06:16.419 --> 00:06:20.320
 does and I think that was 

00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:21.250
 cod untypical for the last years because 

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:22.720
 you always knew something 

00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:24.370
 it will happen either modern 

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:26.110
 warfare on or black ops come out 

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:27.940
 but it was always predictable you knew 

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:30.010
 always somehow what would happen and 

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:31.419
 I think she had a right one 

00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:32.979
 Step in that you say you want it now 

00:06:31.419 --> 00:06:34.960
 what makes completely new you want this 

00:06:32.979 --> 00:06:36.550
 close the row and cod again in 

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:37.840
 I lead a completely different direction 

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:39.159
 believe it could be on the one hand 

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:39.920
 quite a bit more classic again 

00:06:39.159 --> 00:06:42.290
 become 

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:43.430
 detail but he can also do it again 

00:06:42.290 --> 00:06:45.290
 a few new features with 

00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:46.880
 bring the cod in part 

00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:48.320
 completely change my eyes what that 

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:49.610
 that will be exactly what I can of course 

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:51.020
 not yet say but i could 

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:52.850
 well imagine it's a big one 

00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:54.140
 success will happen again though 

00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:55.670
 Of course, the sales figures in the 

00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:57.380
 last years have always voted but 

00:06:55.670 --> 00:06:58.280
 The feedback from the community was never 

00:06:57.380 --> 00:06:59.930
 so great 

00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:02.420
 so I have to say that it is 

00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:04.160
 I really like what's in there 

00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:05.780
 trailer has been shown so far, too 

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:06.860
 Gameplay scenes are short 

00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:08.150
 but have shown that the 

00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:09.830
 weapons again a little more classic 

00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:11.060
 this is, for example, one of these 

00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:13.190
 aspects that do not cool find that the 

00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:14.900
 weapons will not be so futuristic though 

00:07:13.190 --> 00:07:16.160
 Overall, I find it cool that that 

00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:17.870
 whole still a bit mysterious 

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:19.580
 is and to everyone again in a new one 

00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:20.780
 direction goes the gameplay is at the 

00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:22.610
 I hope it has you 

00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:23.210
 fallen and say bye bye 

00:07:22.610 --> 00:07:25.600
 next time 

00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:25.600
 smock
