00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
essentially brand new not only is it

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.979 
essentially brand new not only is it
lighter<00:00:42.690> but<00:00:43.079> it<00:00:43.170> has<00:00:43.260> more<00:00:43.590> power<00:00:43.860> more<00:00:44.640> grip

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:00.320 
thing is such grip in the corners it's a

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:02.470 
thing is such grip in the corners it's a
big<00:01:00.560> car<00:01:00.830> it's<00:01:01.190> not<00:01:01.520> like<00:01:01.880> no<00:01:02.210> matter<00:01:02.330> what

the a Celeste loves to be man and it's
really<00:01:19.369> really<00:01:19.460> wealthier<00:01:20.090> than<00:01:20.299> this

00:01:26.859 --> 00:01:26.869 

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:29.719 

the<00:01:27.869> difference<00:01:28.380> between<00:01:28.530> the<00:01:28.740> blacks<00:01:28.950> ASLs

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
the difference between the blacks ASLs

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.340 
the difference between the blacks ASLs
understanding<00:01:30.360> as<00:01:30.479> well<00:01:30.570> as<00:01:30.689> the<00:01:30.810> cheeki<00:01:31.110> for

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
understanding as well as the cheeki for

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.529 
understanding as well as the cheeki for
example<00:01:31.770> is<00:01:31.860> is<00:01:32.100> is<00:01:32.729> huge<00:01:33.030> it's<00:01:33.240> bigger<00:01:33.450> than

00:01:33.529 --> 00:01:33.539 
example is is is huge it's bigger than

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:34.969 
example is is is huge it's bigger than
every<00:01:33.780> time<00:01:33.990> we<00:01:34.140> did<00:01:34.289> for<00:01:34.530> Black<00:01:34.770> Series

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
every time we did for Black Series

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.669 
every time we did for Black Series
because<00:01:35.880> the<00:01:36.149> target<00:01:36.600> of<00:01:36.689> an<00:01:36.810> SLS<00:01:37.110> boxes<00:01:37.530> was

00:01:37.669 --> 00:01:37.679 
because the target of an SLS boxes was

00:01:37.679 --> 00:01:39.649 
because the target of an SLS boxes was
always<00:01:37.979> a<00:01:38.009> race<00:01:38.340> car<00:01:38.700> street-legal

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
always a race car street-legal

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.690 
always a race car street-legal
and<00:01:39.869> I<00:01:40.409> think<00:01:40.619> you<00:01:40.740> felt<00:01:41.039> that<00:01:41.250> when<00:01:41.460> you<00:01:41.490> drove

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
and I think you felt that when you drove

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.850 
and I think you felt that when you drove
the<00:01:41.850> car<00:01:41.880> and<00:01:42.329> yeah<00:01:43.259> the<00:01:43.380> difference<00:01:43.710> is

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
the car and yeah the difference is

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.609 
the car and yeah the difference is
there's<00:01:44.759> less<00:01:44.909> plexus<00:01:45.360> and<00:01:45.470> that's<00:01:46.470> very

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
there's less plexus and that's very

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.139 
there's less plexus and that's very
important<00:01:46.920> for<00:01:46.950> us<00:01:47.069> this<00:01:47.280> is<00:01:47.460> a<00:01:47.490> statement<00:01:47.939> of

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
important for us this is a statement of

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.359 
important for us this is a statement of
technology<00:01:48.720> so<00:01:48.960> we<00:01:49.079> we<00:01:49.409> used<00:01:49.619> to<00:01:49.770> wait<00:01:50.009> off<00:01:50.250> the

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
technology so we we used to wait off the

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:53.719 
technology so we we used to wait off the
car<00:01:51.200> 70<00:01:52.200> kilograms<00:01:52.619> using<00:01:53.399> carbon<00:01:53.700> fiber

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
car 70 kilograms using carbon fiber

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.309 
car 70 kilograms using carbon fiber
components<00:01:54.479> so<00:01:54.539> we<00:01:54.659> have<00:01:54.750> a<00:01:54.780> structural

00:01:55.309 --> 00:01:55.319 
components so we have a structural

00:01:55.319 --> 00:01:56.899 
components so we have a structural
application<00:01:55.979> in<00:01:56.099> there<00:01:56.280> which<00:01:56.429> is<00:01:56.580> the<00:01:56.610> torque

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
application in there which is the torque

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.089 
application in there which is the torque
you<00:01:57.209> we<00:01:58.020> have<00:01:58.170> a<00:01:58.200> different<00:01:58.560> set<00:01:58.679> up<00:01:58.860> in<00:01:58.979> the

00:01:59.089 --> 00:01:59.099 
you we have a different set up in the

00:01:59.099 --> 00:02:00.919 
you we have a different set up in the
car<00:01:59.310> we<00:01:59.520> have<00:01:59.700> a<00:01:59.729> wider<00:01:59.970> track<00:02:00.330> we<00:02:00.539> have<00:02:00.659> wider

00:02:00.919 --> 00:02:00.929 
car we have a wider track we have wider

00:02:00.929 --> 00:02:02.630 
car we have a wider track we have wider
tires<00:02:01.319> in<00:02:01.590> there<00:02:01.770> we<00:02:01.920> have<00:02:02.039> a<00:02:02.069> rear<00:02:02.399> we<00:02:02.610> have

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
tires in there we have a rear we have

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.800 
tires in there we have a rear we have
325<00:02:03.830> tires<00:02:04.830> in<00:02:05.099> the<00:02:05.130> front<00:02:05.310> we<00:02:05.520> have<00:02:05.549> 275<00:02:06.270> tires
