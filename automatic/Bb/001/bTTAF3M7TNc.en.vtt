 October 2013 a date that more or 

00:00:55.809 --> 00:01:00.180
 least almost everyone intuited monti 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:02.829

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:05.259
 in principle game will be released on xbox 

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:06.610
 360 and in playstation 3 although it has 

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:09.460
 announced that it will come out for more 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:11.180
 platforms is to say it is very likely that 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:13.220
 just leave in 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:17.540
 the one that comes out in precision 3 and in xbox 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:22.160
 but I do not think I do not think those of th q 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:24.560
 sorry, be so stupid not to take the 

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:26.570
 game in infinity xbox or playstation 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:29.030
 4 since a lot of people are going to 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:32.210
 buy myself among them 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:33.950
 I do not think they are not so stupid for not 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:35.750
 put the game on the market in what 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:37.630
 would be the new generation of 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:39.820
 video game consoles 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:42.159
 of rock will be contributed not yet 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:45.280
 let's be the whole cover I suppose 

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:47.470
 will show later we will put by 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:50.080
 about how last year survivor series 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:52.180
 I do not lie 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:53.860
 this in its series value was announced the 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:56.530
 exit of the game 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:58.840
 this year it was reported more or less 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:01.660
 well before the new year or so 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:05.020
 sad bridge brussino buyout shows 

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:07.119
 a cover was shown 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:09.970
 remember that since rock will come out in 

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:12.700
 this image of the game although as I have already 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:14.620
 said nothing is taken out and for the 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:17.950
 people who are alarming and they say no 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:21.129
 they're going to take it out of the video and 2014 to 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:25.360
 playstation 4 and xbox infinite and not os 

00:02:21.129 --> 00:02:27.489
 you fear to trust what I believe 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:29.860
 will happen and it is very likely that 

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:31.629
 yes that goes for the precision 4 is more 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:33.879
 salt of precision four teams of 

00:02:31.629 --> 00:02:38.340
 between 60 and possibly also leave 

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:41.400
 a version for wii is as normal 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:43.500
 lengthening how much they want to sell a 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:46.140
 little bit more I think that they could even 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:48.390
 get a version for PC life but not 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:51.870
 for nothing friends think this is all 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:55.819
 that I have brought my opinion and others and 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:55.819
 see you in the next goodbye
