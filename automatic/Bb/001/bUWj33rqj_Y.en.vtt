00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:36.520 
and then the third picture is actually
was<00:03:33.790> yesterday<00:03:34.790> when<00:03:35.270> I<00:03:35.300> washed<00:03:35.690> my<00:03:35.930> hair<00:03:36.170> and

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:36.530 
was yesterday when I washed my hair and

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:39.160 
was yesterday when I washed my hair and
I<00:03:37.510> can't<00:03:38.510> remember<00:03:38.600> how<00:03:38.810> long<00:03:38.840> it's<00:03:39.140> been

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:39.170 
I can't remember how long it's been

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:40.570 
I can't remember how long it's been
since<00:03:39.410> I<00:03:39.470> did<00:03:39.650> the<00:03:39.740> black<00:03:39.920> tears<00:03:40.100> but<00:03:40.250> I<00:03:40.310> think

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:40.580 
since I did the black tears but I think

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:42.700 
since I did the black tears but I think
it's<00:03:40.760> been<00:03:41.180> like<00:03:41.210> over<00:03:41.720> a<00:03:41.960> month<00:03:42.320> I've<00:03:42.470> only
