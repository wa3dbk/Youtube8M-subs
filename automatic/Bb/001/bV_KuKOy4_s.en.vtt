00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.250
 welcome everybody today it's time 

00:00:04.279 --> 00:00:12.870
 replant my monster 

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:16.260
 for this I need a little pot 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:18.150
 more size than previous since 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:24.930
 Monstera does not like too much 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:26.480
 the space may rot a little 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:30.420
 land 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:33.329
 because I'm going to leave this 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:36.390
 earthen whom she grows with 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:37.230
 rooted by no means impossible 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:45.360
 pull out 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:47.210
 leave in the same form like this 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:50.879
 big 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:56.370
 here are four holes that we 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:57.920
 pierce either with help you need either 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:01.710
 something island 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:03.379
 there must be at least a small amount 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:07.680
 drainage 

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:10.820
 so that our roots do not rot because 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:14.820
 I already had such a negative experience 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:19.560
 forgot to put drainage and my flower 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:22.259
 I began to look I thought that he was not from me 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:26.280
 lack of moisture it turned out that from excess 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:28.770
 and then when already save so to speak 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.690
 this is impossible I saw that the roots are all 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.450
 turned out to be out 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:37.300
 and therefore at least a small amount 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:38.420
 for clicked should be now I will start 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:43.670
 immediate 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:46.820
 transplants are such an earthen ball together 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:53.660
 with the roots of mozgunova here you can see 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:57.050
 the roots here are young greenbacks 

00:01:53.660 --> 00:02:02.530
 sprouts our healthy roots 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:05.990
 not rotten yes does not have such 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:09.610
 yellowish green then look to the touch they 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:15.730
 so wet not wet 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:18.430
 not dry means everything is fine with us. 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:25.850
 to the bottom of the pot 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:28.070
 we sprinkle a small amount of earth i 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:30.940
 I think that one bag will be as well 

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:33.680
 looks like my flower is already jumping 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:37.480
 it turned out that it took two bags of none 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:41.660
 In the process I measured it a little finely 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:44.840
 this one turns out to be a process 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:48.080
 he touched the liar I thought something 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:52.959
 it will not be very comfortable so I had to 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:56.680
 fall asleep into this remaining space 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:03:00.050
 between the pot and the flower we step de 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:04.400
 our transplant is over my suit 

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:10.900
 monster to this put points on the pallet 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:15.290
 and I can not field 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:16.790
 field without fertilizers because the earth 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:21.489
 already contains fertilizer 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:21.489
 excess will not be good 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:29.659
 so quite a bit 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:31.159
 that the ground was wet and will hope 

00:03:29.659 --> 00:03:36.760
 what's my flower 

00:03:31.159 --> 00:03:39.290
 like new land new such house 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:46.299
 next time I plan to replant 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:46.299
 dieffenbachia their all until
