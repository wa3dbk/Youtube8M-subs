truly an emergency and you need to get
out<00:00:54.270> of<00:00:54.390> the<00:00:54.480> elements<00:00:54.780> and<00:00:55.170> out<00:00:55.440> of<00:00:55.590> the<00:00:55.680> wind

so here's how it goes

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.750 
so here's how it goes
we're<00:01:00.660> gonna<00:01:00.780> lay<00:01:01.050> out<00:01:01.079> a<00:01:01.530> very<00:01:01.980> narrow<00:01:02.280> trough

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
we're gonna lay out a very narrow trough

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:08.450 
we're gonna lay out a very narrow trough
that<00:01:03.149> is<00:01:03.660> roughly<00:01:05.000> maybe<00:01:06.000> six<00:01:06.960> feet<00:01:07.400> by<00:01:08.400> two

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
that is roughly maybe six feet by two

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.240 
that is roughly maybe six feet by two
and<00:01:08.880> a<00:01:08.909> half<00:01:09.119> feet<00:01:09.420> and<00:01:09.720> we're<00:01:10.710> gonna<00:01:10.799> dig<00:01:11.100> that

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
and a half feet and we're gonna dig that

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.330 
and a half feet and we're gonna dig that
out<00:01:11.310> about<00:01:12.210> four<00:01:12.510> feet<00:01:12.780> deep<00:01:13.020> and<00:01:13.290> then<00:01:13.860> if<00:01:14.189> you

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
out about four feet deep and then if you

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:15.440 
out about four feet deep and then if you
were<00:01:14.460> to<00:01:14.520> look<00:01:14.760> at<00:01:14.909> it<00:01:15.030> in<00:01:15.119> the<00:01:15.210> cross-section

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
were to look at it in the cross-section

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.450 
were to look at it in the cross-section
once<00:01:16.049> we're<00:01:16.229> down<00:01:16.409> in<00:01:16.650> there<00:01:16.830> we're<00:01:17.310> gonna

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
once we're down in there we're gonna

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.179 
once we're down in there we're gonna
bulb<00:01:17.850> it<00:01:18.000> out<00:01:18.210> so<00:01:18.540> that's<00:01:18.659> step<00:01:19.020> one<00:01:19.320> so<00:01:20.040> it's

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
bulb it out so that's step one so it's

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.760 
bulb it out so that's step one so it's
important<00:01:20.700> that<00:01:20.970> the<00:01:21.420> top<00:01:21.720> of<00:01:22.049> your<00:01:22.470> shelter

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
doesn't become too wide maybe only about

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:28.039 
doesn't become too wide maybe only about
like<00:01:25.920> shoulder-width<00:01:26.600> one<00:01:27.600> of<00:01:27.720> the<00:01:27.840> very

there and I'm probably gonna be on my
knees<00:02:08.119> and<00:02:08.420> start<00:02:09.229> hollowing<00:02:09.560> out<00:02:10.039> the<00:02:10.429> volume

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:11.060 
knees and start hollowing out the volume

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:14.680 
knees and start hollowing out the volume
in<00:02:11.450> there<00:02:12.140> without<00:02:12.920> touching<00:02:13.580> the<00:02:14.390> sort<00:02:14.630> of

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:14.690 
in there without touching the sort of

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:17.320 
in there without touching the sort of
narrow<00:02:15.019> crest<00:02:15.500> of<00:02:15.800> the<00:02:15.950> top<00:02:16.220> so<00:02:17.000> there's<00:02:17.180> gonna

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:17.330 
narrow crest of the top so there's gonna

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:19.330 
narrow crest of the top so there's gonna
be<00:02:17.510> a<00:02:17.540> lot<00:02:17.720> of<00:02:17.750> contacting<00:02:18.470> with<00:02:18.620> the<00:02:18.800> snow<00:02:19.040> so

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:19.340 
be a lot of contacting with the snow so

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:22.390 
be a lot of contacting with the snow so
there<00:02:19.489> my<00:02:19.610> nice<00:02:20.300> puffy<00:02:21.019> insulative<00:02:21.800> layer<00:02:22.130> I'm

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:22.400 
there my nice puffy insulative layer I'm

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.699 
there my nice puffy insulative layer I'm
gonna<00:02:22.550> take<00:02:22.790> that<00:02:22.970> off<00:02:23.150> now<00:02:23.230> so<00:02:24.230> that<00:02:24.410> when<00:02:24.530> I'm

depending on how far in the process I am
I<00:02:50.500> can<00:02:51.500> now<00:02:51.680> use<00:02:52.780> this<00:02:54.220> whole<00:02:55.220> feature<00:02:56.290> it's

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:57.290 
I can now use this whole feature it's

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:59.860 
I can now use this whole feature it's
pretty<00:02:57.500> convenient<00:02:57.980> and<00:02:58.430> I<00:02:59.060> can<00:02:59.269> sort<00:02:59.780> of

00:02:59.860 --> 00:02:59.870 
pretty convenient and I can sort of

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:02.710 
pretty convenient and I can sort of
start<00:03:00.049> getting<00:03:00.230> down<00:03:00.530> on<00:03:00.560> my<00:03:00.829> knees<00:03:01.100> and<00:03:01.720> and

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:02.720 
start getting down on my knees and and

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:06.970 
start getting down on my knees and and
start<00:03:03.650> hollowing<00:03:04.579> out<00:03:05.000> the<00:03:05.390> space<00:03:06.109> here<00:03:06.530> and

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:06.980 
start hollowing out the space here and

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:10.180 
start hollowing out the space here and
give<00:03:07.250> myself<00:03:07.959> just<00:03:08.959> about<00:03:09.230> as<00:03:09.380> much<00:03:09.590> volume<00:03:09.859> as

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:10.190 
give myself just about as much volume as

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:11.819 
give myself just about as much volume as
I<00:03:11.000> want<00:03:11.299> to

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:11.829 
I want to

00:03:11.829 --> 00:03:18.280 
I want to
so<00:03:12.829> I<00:03:13.160> hollow<00:03:13.970> it<00:03:14.180> out<00:03:14.329> and<00:03:14.950> start<00:03:15.950> and<00:03:17.290> start

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:18.290 
so I hollow it out and start and start

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:20.800 
so I hollow it out and start and start
making<00:03:19.160> more<00:03:19.310> volume<00:03:19.730> for<00:03:19.760> myself<00:03:20.299> but

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:20.810 
making more volume for myself but

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:23.379 
making more volume for myself but
important<00:03:21.350> without<00:03:21.950> damaging<00:03:22.790> the<00:03:23.120> narrow

00:03:23.379 --> 00:03:23.389 
important without damaging the narrow

00:03:23.389 --> 00:03:32.260 
important without damaging the narrow
crest<00:03:23.780> of<00:03:24.019> the<00:03:24.230> upper<00:03:24.440> perimeter<00:03:24.920> here

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:32.270 

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:36.370 

as<00:03:33.270> you<00:03:33.510> can<00:03:33.690> see<00:03:33.930> with<00:03:34.920> very<00:03:34.950> little<00:03:35.370> effort

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:36.380 
as you can see with very little effort

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:41.060 
as you can see with very little effort
we<00:03:37.380> have<00:03:37.530> now<00:03:38.150> sort<00:03:39.150> of<00:03:39.180> achieved<00:03:39.690> the<00:03:40.620> initial

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:41.070 
we have now sort of achieved the initial

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:43.040 
we have now sort of achieved the initial
stages<00:03:41.460> of<00:03:41.700> sort<00:03:42.030> of<00:03:42.060> like<00:03:42.240> this<00:03:42.390> pear<00:03:42.720> shape

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:43.050 
stages of sort of like this pear shape

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:45.860 
stages of sort of like this pear shape
where<00:03:43.980> we<00:03:44.730> have<00:03:44.880> like<00:03:45.090> the<00:03:45.210> top<00:03:45.450> that<00:03:45.750> is

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:45.870 
where we have like the top that is

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:50.110 
where we have like the top that is
fairly<00:03:46.110> narrow<00:03:46.440> and<00:03:46.920> it<00:03:47.400> comes<00:03:47.640> out<00:03:47.820> and<00:03:48.380> then

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:50.120 
fairly narrow and it comes out and then

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:54.020 
fairly narrow and it comes out and then
bulbs<00:03:51.120> out<00:03:51.270> and<00:03:51.750> as<00:03:52.290> you<00:03:52.410> can<00:03:52.560> imagine<00:03:52.970> this<00:03:53.970> is

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:54.030 
bulbs out and as you can imagine this is

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:57.410 
bulbs out and as you can imagine this is
sort<00:03:54.390> of<00:03:54.450> like<00:03:54.630> a<00:03:55.050> matter<00:03:55.740> of<00:03:56.120> you<00:03:57.120> know<00:03:57.240> how

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:57.420 
sort of like a matter of you know how

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:00.550 
sort of like a matter of you know how
much<00:03:57.600> work<00:03:57.840> you<00:03:57.990> want<00:03:58.170> to<00:03:58.260> put<00:03:58.410> into<00:03:58.710> it<00:03:58.860> and

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:00.560 
much work you want to put into it and

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:03.260 
much work you want to put into it and
you<00:04:01.560> know<00:04:01.680> and<00:04:01.950> you<00:04:02.310> can<00:04:02.490> make<00:04:02.520> it<00:04:02.670> especially

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:03.270 
you know and you can make it especially

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:04.940 
you know and you can make it especially
when<00:04:03.420> you<00:04:03.510> have<00:04:03.630> a<00:04:03.660> deep<00:04:03.900> snowpack<00:04:04.200> like<00:04:04.620> here

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:04.950

and<00:04:28.890> what<00:04:29.850> I<00:04:29.880> have<00:04:30.120> is<00:04:30.420> like<00:04:30.540> with<00:04:30.750> my<00:04:30.930> my

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:31.920 
and what I have is like with my my

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:35.600 
and what I have is like with my my
companion<00:04:32.550> Sarah<00:04:33.540> here<00:04:33.900> we<00:04:34.440> have<00:04:34.620> a<00:04:34.890> total<00:04:35.460> of

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:35.610 
companion Sarah here we have a total of

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:39.980 
companion Sarah here we have a total of
four<00:04:36.419> skis<00:04:36.960> and<00:04:37.580> four<00:04:38.580> poles<00:04:38.940> and<00:04:39.240> that<00:04:39.840> will

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:39.990 
four skis and four poles and that will

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:48.190 
four skis and four poles and that will
create<00:04:40.140> the<00:04:40.320> roof<00:04:40.620> frame<00:04:40.919> it's<00:04:41.400> pretty<00:04:41.669> simple

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:48.200 

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:50.450 

kind<00:04:49.200> of<00:04:49.230> nice<00:04:49.440> to<00:04:49.620> have<00:04:49.740> these<00:04:49.950> extendable

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:50.460 
kind of nice to have these extendable

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:52.909 
kind of nice to have these extendable
poles<00:04:50.850> you<00:04:51.180> can<00:04:51.330> sort<00:04:51.540> of<00:04:51.630> make<00:04:52.620> the<00:04:52.770> whole

00:04:52.909 --> 00:04:52.919 
poles you can sort of make the whole

00:04:52.919 --> 00:04:56.600 
poles you can sort of make the whole
thing<00:04:53.190> as<00:04:53.370> wide<00:04:53.550> as<00:04:53.790> you<00:04:54.000> as<00:04:54.210> you<00:04:54.690> want<00:04:54.960> to<00:04:55.610> this

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:56.610 
thing as wide as you as you want to this

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:59.690 
thing as wide as you as you want to this
will<00:04:56.820> then<00:04:57.120> create<00:04:57.390> the<00:04:57.720> entrance<00:04:58.140> and<00:04:58.700> that's

00:04:59.690 --> 00:04:59.700 
will then create the entrance and that's

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:01.430 
will then create the entrance and that's
just<00:05:00.090> big<00:05:00.330> enough<00:05:00.360> so<00:05:00.750> that<00:05:00.780> we<00:05:01.020> can<00:05:01.169> sort<00:05:01.380> of

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:01.440 
just big enough so that we can sort of

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:05.360 
just big enough so that we can sort of
slide<00:05:01.680> in<00:05:01.950> there<00:05:02.270> okay<00:05:03.270> so<00:05:04.200> of<00:05:04.800> course<00:05:05.070> since

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:05.370 
slide in there okay so of course since

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:06.560 
slide in there okay so of course since

structure<00:05:25.750> Sarah<00:05:26.750> created<00:05:27.380> a<00:05:27.700> little<00:05:28.700> bit<00:05:28.850> of

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:28.910 
structure Sarah created a little bit of

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:31.660 
structure Sarah created a little bit of
a<00:05:29.060> quarry<00:05:29.390> here<00:05:29.720> for<00:05:29.960> me<00:05:30.140> and<00:05:30.550> centered<00:05:31.550> that

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:31.670 
a quarry here for me and centered that

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:35.590 
a quarry here for me and centered that
snow<00:05:32.000> down<00:05:32.320> so<00:05:33.320> that<00:05:33.500> can<00:05:33.710> sort<00:05:33.860> of<00:05:34.180> lay<00:05:35.180> blocks

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:35.600 
snow down so that can sort of lay blocks

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:37.360 
snow down so that can sort of lay blocks
on<00:05:35.930> top<00:05:36.140> of<00:05:36.320> all<00:05:36.440> of<00:05:36.590> this<00:05:36.680> stuff<00:05:36.830> and<00:05:37.130> sort<00:05:37.220> of

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:37.370 
on top of all of this stuff and sort of

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:39.610 
on top of all of this stuff and sort of
with<00:05:38.300> larger<00:05:38.780> building<00:05:39.140> blocks<00:05:39.350> start

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:39.620 
with larger building blocks start

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:42.250 
with larger building blocks start
covering<00:05:39.920> up<00:05:40.310> the<00:05:41.150> gaps<00:05:41.390> between<00:05:41.690> the<00:05:42.020> skis

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:42.260 
covering up the gaps between the skis

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:45.700 
covering up the gaps between the skis
and<00:05:42.410> the<00:05:42.500> poles<00:05:42.740> you<00:05:43.700> can<00:05:43.730> also<00:05:44.060> use<00:05:44.390> a<00:05:44.420> tarp<00:05:44.870> if

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:45.710 
and the poles you can also use a tarp if

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:48.160 
and the poles you can also use a tarp if
you<00:05:45.980> have<00:05:46.130> something<00:05:46.430> like<00:05:46.610> that<00:05:47.020> but<00:05:48.020> I<00:05:48.050> don't

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:48.170 
you have something like that but I don't

00:05:48.170 --> 00:06:00.000 
you have something like that but I don't
so<00:05:48.770> I'll<00:05:48.860> have<00:05:49.040> to<00:05:49.220> I'll<00:05:49.970> have<00:05:50.210> to<00:05:50.300> just<00:05:50.480> deal

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:00.010 

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:05.320 

alright<00:06:01.330> so<00:06:02.330> here<00:06:02.740> here<00:06:03.740> we<00:06:03.920> are<00:06:04.150> just<00:06:05.150> took

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:05.330 
alright so here here we are just took

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:09.180 
alright so here here we are just took
roughly<00:06:05.570> a<00:06:05.720> half<00:06:05.930> an<00:06:06.080> hour<00:06:06.230> and<00:06:06.940> I<00:06:07.940> can<00:06:08.750> feel

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:09.190 
roughly a half an hour and I can feel

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:12.640 
roughly a half an hour and I can feel
absolutely<00:06:10.190> no<00:06:10.460> wind<00:06:10.700> and<00:06:11.110> very<00:06:12.110> quickly<00:06:12.380> the

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:12.650 
absolutely no wind and very quickly the

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:14.770 
absolutely no wind and very quickly the
temperature<00:06:12.830> in<00:06:13.430> here<00:06:14.150> will<00:06:14.570> start

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:14.780 
temperature in here will start

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:17.530 
temperature in here will start
approaching<00:06:15.490> roughly<00:06:16.490> 0<00:06:16.730> degrees<00:06:17.060> Celsius

00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:17.540 
approaching roughly 0 degrees Celsius

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:19.900 
approaching roughly 0 degrees Celsius
that's<00:06:18.500> about<00:06:18.800> as<00:06:18.919> warm<00:06:19.130> as<00:06:19.340> we<00:06:19.490> wanted

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:19.910 
that's about as warm as we wanted

00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:23.110 
that's about as warm as we wanted
actually<00:06:20.120> to<00:06:20.390> then<00:06:21.140> we<00:06:21.260> don't<00:06:21.410> have<00:06:22.120> melted

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:23.120 
actually to then we don't have melted

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:27.370 
actually to then we don't have melted
and<00:06:23.450> dripping<00:06:23.690> in<00:06:24.110> here<00:06:24.470> and<00:06:25.060> right<00:06:26.060> now<00:06:26.380> the

00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:27.380 
and dripping in here and right now the

00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:29.800 
and dripping in here and right now the
idea<00:06:27.680> is<00:06:27.770> that<00:06:28.610> I<00:06:28.669> can<00:06:28.910> hunker<00:06:29.090> down<00:06:29.240> and<00:06:29.450> maybe

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:29.810 
idea is that I can hunker down and maybe

00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:31.870 
idea is that I can hunker down and maybe
sit<00:06:30.140> on<00:06:30.230> top<00:06:30.410> of<00:06:30.470> my<00:06:30.590> backpack<00:06:30.919> or<00:06:31.490> sit<00:06:31.640> on<00:06:31.700> top

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:31.880 
sit on top of my backpack or sit on top

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:35.770 
sit on top of my backpack or sit on top
of<00:06:32.060> something<00:06:32.740> and<00:06:33.740> I<00:06:34.370> can<00:06:34.580> have<00:06:35.360> a<00:06:35.419> little<00:06:35.690> bit

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:35.780 
of something and I can have a little bit

00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:39.220 
of something and I can have a little bit
of<00:06:35.900> head<00:06:36.050> clearance<00:06:37.330> and<00:06:38.330> then<00:06:38.870> of<00:06:39.020> course

00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:39.230 
of head clearance and then of course

00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:42.010 
of head clearance and then of course
after<00:06:39.500> that<00:06:40.180> we<00:06:41.180> can<00:06:41.330> make<00:06:41.510> it<00:06:41.660> as<00:06:41.780> comfortable

00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:42.020 
after that we can make it as comfortable

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:46.030 
after that we can make it as comfortable
and<00:06:42.490> as<00:06:43.490> spacious<00:06:43.940> as<00:06:43.970> we<00:06:44.900> want<00:06:45.110> to<00:06:45.290> and<00:06:45.530> so

00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:46.040 
and as spacious as we want to and so

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:50.970 
and as spacious as we want to and so
once<00:06:46.250> we<00:06:46.400> start<00:06:46.460> like<00:06:46.790> working<00:06:47.180> inside<00:06:48.100> the

00:06:50.970 --> 00:06:50.980 
once we start like working inside the

00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:53.590 
once we start like working inside the
shelter<00:06:51.980> and<00:06:52.610> we<00:06:52.760> don't<00:06:52.910> have<00:06:53.030> a<00:06:53.060> lot<00:06:53.270> of<00:06:53.390> room

00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:53.600 
shelter and we don't have a lot of room

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:55.750 
shelter and we don't have a lot of room
to<00:06:53.630> swing<00:06:54.050> a<00:06:54.140> shovel<00:06:54.470> around<00:06:54.560> anymore<00:06:54.950> then

00:06:55.750 --> 00:06:55.760 
to swing a shovel around anymore then

00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:59.320 
to swing a shovel around anymore then
all<00:06:55.910> of<00:06:55.940> a<00:06:56.090> sudden<00:06:56.260> this<00:06:57.260> whole<00:06:57.860> feature<00:06:58.330> of

00:06:59.320 --> 00:06:59.330 
all of a sudden this whole feature of

00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:03.850 
all of a sudden this whole feature of
this<00:06:59.720> shovel<00:07:01.810> comes<00:07:02.810> in<00:07:02.990> extremely<00:07:03.470> handy

00:07:03.850 --> 00:07:03.860 
this shovel comes in extremely handy

00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:07.390 
this shovel comes in extremely handy
because<00:07:04.360> now<00:07:05.440> you<00:07:06.440> know<00:07:06.560> we<00:07:06.710> may<00:07:06.830> be<00:07:06.860> started

00:07:07.390 --> 00:07:07.400 
because now you know we may be started

00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:10.960 
because now you know we may be started
out<00:07:07.990> just<00:07:08.990> for<00:07:09.200> -<00:07:09.380> or<00:07:09.740> a<00:07:09.950> shelter<00:07:10.340> for<00:07:10.490> one<00:07:10.730> but

00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:10.970 
out just for - or a shelter for one but

00:07:10.970 --> 00:07:12.600 
out just for - or a shelter for one but
I<00:07:11.000> mean<00:07:11.210> it's<00:07:11.360> sort<00:07:11.690> of<00:07:11.810> the

00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:12.610 
I mean it's sort of the

00:07:12.610 --> 00:07:15.809 
I mean it's sort of the
we<00:07:12.729> can<00:07:13.590> hollow<00:07:14.590> this<00:07:14.830> out<00:07:15.039> on<00:07:15.189> the<00:07:15.280> side<00:07:15.490> quite

00:07:15.809 --> 00:07:15.819 
we can hollow this out on the side quite

00:07:15.819 --> 00:07:17.670 
we can hollow this out on the side quite
a<00:07:15.849> bit<00:07:16.090> the<00:07:16.810> only<00:07:17.020> thing<00:07:17.169> we<00:07:17.289> have<00:07:17.439> to<00:07:17.530> pay

a bit the only thing we have to pay
attention<00:07:17.949> to<00:07:18.189> here<00:07:18.580> is<00:07:18.930> if<00:07:19.930> we<00:07:20.470> afterwards<00:07:20.800> go

00:07:21.179 --> 00:07:21.189 
attention to here is if we afterwards go

00:07:21.189 --> 00:07:23.490 
attention to here is if we afterwards go
outside<00:07:21.729> that<00:07:22.449> we<00:07:22.569> don't<00:07:22.750> and<00:07:23.229> we<00:07:23.349> have
