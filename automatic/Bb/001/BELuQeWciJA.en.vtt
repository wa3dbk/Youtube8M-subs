where<00:04:08.850> we<00:04:09.030> got<00:04:09.210> stuck<00:04:09.510> parking<00:04:12.920> and<00:04:13.920> that's

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:14.130 
where we got stuck parking and that's

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:16.520 
where we got stuck parking and that's
the<00:04:14.250> hill<00:04:14.580> we<00:04:14.790> had<00:04:14.970> to<00:04:15.090> walk<00:04:15.270> up<00:04:15.510> every<00:04:16.230> freakin

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:16.530 
the hill we had to walk up every freakin

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:17.780 
the hill we had to walk up every freakin
day<00:04:16.560> which<00:04:16.950> is<00:04:17.100> probably<00:04:17.400> one<00:04:17.610> of<00:04:17.640> the

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:17.790 
day which is probably one of the

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:19.370 
day which is probably one of the
downsides<00:04:17.970> oh<00:04:18.450> I<00:04:18.480> guess<00:04:18.840> good<00:04:19.110> if<00:04:19.230> you're

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:19.380
