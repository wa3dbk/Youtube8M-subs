00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
some go on access and a factory machine

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.190 
some go on access and a factory machine
block<00:00:59.730> now<00:00:59.969> the<00:01:00.030> factory<00:01:00.420> machine<00:01:00.750> block<00:01:00.960> is

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:01.200 
block now the factory machine block is

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:03.799 
block now the factory machine block is
created<00:01:01.890> using<00:01:02.100> plastic<00:01:02.670> sheets<00:01:02.940> and<00:01:03.149> stone

and keep in mind you need these for
every<00:01:06.210> my<00:01:06.899> factory<00:01:07.289> reloaded<00:01:07.889> machine<00:01:08.219> so<00:01:08.399> you

00:01:08.419 --> 00:01:08.429 
every my factory reloaded machine so you

00:01:08.429 --> 00:01:10.190 
every my factory reloaded machine so you
might<00:01:08.729> want<00:01:08.999> to<00:01:09.090> make<00:01:09.240> a<00:01:09.270> couple<00:01:09.600> of<00:01:09.780> those<00:01:09.959> and

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
might want to make a couple of those and

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.709 
might want to make a couple of those and
of<00:01:10.770> course<00:01:11.069> plastic<00:01:11.549> sheets<00:01:11.789> are<00:01:12.030> made<00:01:12.270> using

00:01:12.709 --> 00:01:12.719 
of course plastic sheets are made using

00:01:12.719 --> 00:01:14.870 
of course plastic sheets are made using
raw<00:01:13.079> plastic<00:01:13.350> which<00:01:14.009> can<00:01:14.310> be<00:01:14.399> obtained<00:01:14.759> from

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
raw plastic which can be obtained from

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.940 
raw plastic which can be obtained from
smelting<00:01:15.569> rubber<00:01:15.780> bars<00:01:16.109> but<00:01:16.350> also<00:01:16.590> rubber

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
smelting rubber bars but also rubber

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.539 
smelting rubber bars but also rubber
from<00:01:17.249> other<00:01:17.459> mods<00:01:19.310> alright

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
from other mods alright

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:25.359 
from other mods alright
then<00:01:20.729> over<00:01:21.299> here<00:01:21.329> we<00:01:22.130> have<00:01:23.130> the<00:01:23.939> meat<00:01:24.359> packer

00:01:25.359 --> 00:01:25.369 
then over here we have the meat packer

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:27.830 
then over here we have the meat packer
now<00:01:26.369> the<00:01:26.429> meat<00:01:26.670> packer<00:01:26.939> is<00:01:27.179> created<00:01:27.659> using

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
now the meat packer is created using

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.459 
now the meat packer is created using
plastic<00:01:28.409> heats<00:01:28.679> some<00:01:29.369> bricks<00:01:29.670> a<00:01:30.229> flint<00:01:31.229> and

00:01:31.459 --> 00:01:31.469 
plastic heats some bricks a flint and

00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:34.010 
plastic heats some bricks a flint and
steel<00:01:31.499> and<00:01:32.130> finally<00:01:32.849> a<00:01:33.060> factory<00:01:33.659> machine

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
steel and finally a factory machine

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.239 
steel and finally a factory machine
block<00:01:35.359> alright<00:01:36.359> so<00:01:36.630> now<00:01:37.349> you<00:01:37.380> might<00:01:37.740> be<00:01:37.889> asking

00:01:38.239 --> 00:01:38.249 
block alright so now you might be asking

00:01:38.249 --> 00:01:41.499 
block alright so now you might be asking
yourself<00:01:38.310> what<00:01:38.939> do<00:01:39.359> these<00:01:39.539> blocks<00:01:39.869> do<00:01:40.279> well

00:01:41.499 --> 00:01:41.509 
yourself what do these blocks do well

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:45.109 
yourself what do these blocks do well
let's<00:01:42.509> have<00:01:42.959> a<00:01:43.020> look<00:01:43.229> so<00:01:43.560> when<00:01:44.490> we<00:01:44.579> place<00:01:44.880> down

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
let's have a look so when we place down

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.779 
let's have a look so when we place down
some<00:01:45.359> cows<00:01:45.659> here<00:01:46.079> the<00:01:47.069> machine<00:01:47.310> is<00:01:47.609> still

00:01:47.779 --> 00:01:47.789 
some cows here the machine is still

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:51.319 
some cows here the machine is still
idling<00:01:48.359> but<00:01:48.569> when<00:01:48.840> it<00:01:49.349> stops<00:01:50.039> idling<00:01:50.549> it<00:01:51.060> will

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
idling but when it stops idling it will

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:54.050 
idling but when it stops idling it will
start<00:01:51.689> slaughtering<00:01:52.259> these<00:01:52.709> cows<00:01:52.979> now<00:01:53.700> over

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
start slaughtering these cows now over

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.059 
start slaughtering these cows now over
here<00:01:54.539> you<00:01:54.599> can<00:01:54.959> see<00:01:55.169> a<00:01:55.200> liquid<00:01:55.740> flowing

00:01:56.059 --> 00:01:56.069 
here you can see a liquid flowing

00:01:56.069 --> 00:01:57.469 
here you can see a liquid flowing
through<00:01:56.369> this<00:01:56.579> liquid<00:01:56.939> act<00:01:57.119> and<00:01:57.299> this

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
through this liquid act and this

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:03.379 
through this liquid act and this
basically<00:01:57.959> liquid<00:01:58.770> meat<00:02:00.259> let's<00:02:02.060> watch<00:02:03.060> that

00:02:03.379 --> 00:02:03.389 
basically liquid meat let's watch that

00:02:03.389 --> 00:02:05.649 
basically liquid meat let's watch that
again

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:05.659 
again

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:08.690 
again
so<00:02:06.659> it's<00:02:06.840> slaughtering<00:02:07.350> the<00:02:07.500> cows<00:02:07.740> and<00:02:08.069> we

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
so it's slaughtering the cows and we

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.609 
so it's slaughtering the cows and we
have<00:02:08.849> some<00:02:09.060> liquid<00:02:09.330> meat<00:02:09.810> running<00:02:10.440> through

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
have some liquid meat running through

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.110 
have some liquid meat running through
the<00:02:10.770> liquid<00:02:10.950> axe<00:02:11.220> now<00:02:11.370> keep<00:02:11.610> in<00:02:11.730> mind<00:02:11.760> this

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
the liquid axe now keep in mind this

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.270 
the liquid axe now keep in mind this
will<00:02:12.330> not<00:02:12.540> kill<00:02:13.110> baby<00:02:13.440> animals

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280 
will not kill baby animals

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:17.390 
will not kill baby animals
so<00:02:14.550> this<00:02:15.300> cow<00:02:15.599> will<00:02:15.930> only<00:02:16.170> be<00:02:16.470> killed<00:02:16.680> once<00:02:17.099> it

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
so this cow will only be killed once it

so this cow will only be killed once it
goes<00:02:17.790> up<00:02:18.440> now<00:02:19.440> over<00:02:19.770> here<00:02:20.250> you<00:02:20.640> have<00:02:20.730> the<00:02:20.849> meat

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.500 
goes up now over here you have the meat
packer<00:02:21.420> as<00:02:22.319> you<00:02:22.709> can<00:02:22.860> see<00:02:23.040> it<00:02:23.190> also<00:02:23.970> has<00:02:24.150> an

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
packer as you can see it also has an

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:27.290 
packer as you can see it also has an
internal<00:02:24.870> liquid<00:02:25.290> buffer<00:02:25.830> but<00:02:26.550> seeing<00:02:27.120> as

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300 
internal liquid buffer but seeing as

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.870 
internal liquid buffer but seeing as
it's<00:02:27.780> got<00:02:28.170> chest<00:02:28.560> here<00:02:28.860> it<00:02:29.010> will<00:02:29.190> just<00:02:29.250> have

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:29.880 
it's got chest here it will just have

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:31.520 
it's got chest here it will just have
with<00:02:30.120> everything<00:02:30.510> nests<00:02:30.690> into<00:02:30.900> there<00:02:31.170> and<00:02:31.380> as

with everything nests into there and as

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:34.970 
with everything nests into there and as
you<00:02:31.650> can<00:02:31.769> see<00:02:31.980> it<00:02:32.430> has<00:02:32.819> actually<00:02:33.980> converted

them in there and create cook meat
ingots<00:05:12.810> now<00:05:13.810> if<00:05:14.139> we<00:05:14.319> go<00:05:14.500> a<00:05:14.530> bit<00:05:14.710> further<00:05:15.009> you

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:15.400 
ingots now if we go a bit further you

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:17.969 
ingots now if we go a bit further you
can<00:05:15.580> see<00:05:15.819> you<00:05:15.969> can<00:05:16.150> also<00:05:16.449> craft<00:05:17.229> this<00:05:17.469> raw<00:05:17.770> meat

00:05:17.969 --> 00:05:17.979 
can see you can also craft this raw meat

00:05:17.979 --> 00:05:23.089 
can see you can also craft this raw meat
ingots<00:05:18.370> into<00:05:18.849> a<00:05:18.879> raw<00:05:19.300> meat<00:05:19.509> block<00:05:20.880> so<00:05:21.880> let's

00:05:23.089 --> 00:05:23.099 
ingots into a raw meat block so let's

00:05:23.099 --> 00:05:26.580 
ingots into a raw meat block so let's
graph<00:05:24.099> these<00:05:24.370> so<00:05:25.060> you<00:05:25.449> can<00:05:25.659> also<00:05:25.810> do<00:05:26.229> the<00:05:26.380> same

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:26.590 
graph these so you can also do the same

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:28.260 
graph these so you can also do the same
thing<00:05:26.650> of<00:05:27.039> course<00:05:27.340> with<00:05:27.639> the<00:05:27.789> cooked<00:05:28.120> meat

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:28.270 
thing of course with the cooked meat

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:34.230 
thing of course with the cooked meat
ingots<00:05:28.840> to<00:05:29.169> get<00:05:29.349> a<00:05:29.560> cooked<00:05:29.860> meat<00:05:30.250> block<00:05:31.380> and<00:05:33.240> I

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:34.240 
ingots to get a cooked meat block and I

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:36.420 
ingots to get a cooked meat block and I
do<00:05:34.300> believe<00:05:34.719> you<00:05:34.990> can<00:05:35.169> also<00:05:35.319> actually<00:05:35.710> cook

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:36.430 
do believe you can also actually cook

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:39.839 
do believe you can also actually cook
the<00:05:36.759> entire<00:05:37.120> block<00:05:37.599> oh<00:05:38.159> yeah<00:05:39.159> apparently<00:05:39.460> you

00:05:39.839 --> 00:05:39.849 
the entire block oh yeah apparently you

00:05:39.849 --> 00:05:42.240 
the entire block oh yeah apparently you
can't<00:05:40.240> okay<00:05:40.479> so<00:05:41.139> you<00:05:41.199> can't<00:05:41.500> cook<00:05:41.770> the<00:05:41.949> blocks

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:42.250 
can't okay so you can't cook the blocks

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:44.010 
can't okay so you can't cook the blocks
but<00:05:42.490> of<00:05:42.610> course<00:05:42.880> you<00:05:43.029> can<00:05:43.270> cook<00:05:43.569> the<00:05:43.719> ingots

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:44.020 
but of course you can cook the ingots

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:48.269 
but of course you can cook the ingots
and<00:05:44.199> craft<00:05:44.529> them<00:05:44.800> into<00:05:44.830> blocks<00:05:45.430> afterwards<00:05:47.279> so

00:05:48.269 --> 00:05:48.279 
and craft them into blocks afterwards so

00:05:48.279 --> 00:05:51.709 
and craft them into blocks afterwards so
that's<00:05:49.000> basically<00:05:49.509> it<00:05:49.810> for<00:05:50.199> the

00:05:51.709 --> 00:05:51.719 
that's basically it for the

00:05:51.719 --> 00:05:54.719 
that's basically it for the
slaughterhouse<00:05:52.719> and<00:05:52.930> the<00:05:53.590> meat<00:05:53.979> packer<00:05:54.340> I
