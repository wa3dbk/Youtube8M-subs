other things we actually use quite a lot
of<00:03:22.220> these<00:03:22.370> wipes<00:03:22.640> I<00:03:23.000> don't<00:03:23.750> think<00:03:23.900> they're

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:23.990 
of these wipes I don't think they're

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:25.060 
of these wipes I don't think they're
very<00:03:24.020> good<00:03:24.170> for<00:03:24.410> you<00:03:24.470> particularly<00:03:25.010> I

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:26.210 
wouldn't recommend them but they are

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:28.150 
wouldn't recommend them but they are
very<00:03:26.450> easy<00:03:26.660> so<00:03:27.020> there's<00:03:27.800> a<00:03:27.860> lot<00:03:27.980> of<00:03:28.040> those

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:32.780
