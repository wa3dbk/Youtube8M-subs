00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.319
 Hello my name is Nick and today I 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:07.470
 I will show you how to make this Greek 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:09.510
 hairstyle and I must be in a hurry to 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:13.799
 meeting with my customer my 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:15.750
 and I suddenly got the idea to do exactly 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:18.300
 This hairstyle although I never before 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:22.760
 did not do but occasionally saw u 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:25.260
 other girls on the street in the subway in a cafe 

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:27.779
 I decided to try it all worked out 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:31.590
 This hairstyle really takes 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:34.950
 five minutes of time and after i 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:37.500
 posted a photo in a group of some girls 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:40.020
 asked me to make a video lesson about 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.640
 how can you make this hairstyle for this 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.469
 hairstyles we need this 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.960
 dressing can be purchased at any 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:54.180
 store selling rezinochki for 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:57.090
 hair pins we need to find it here 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:59.579
 so generally actually in 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:02.250
 last time I did this hairstyle without 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:04.470
 parting tell you a secret what to do 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.090
 this hairstyle on curly hair lined 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:10.200
 much easier than dark 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:12.240
 you can for example curl one's hair 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.170
 a day to leave curled hair on 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:17.909
 Next line do this hairstyle 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:29.570
 Here is a little to get a small strand 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:29.570
 hair and wrap and and rezinochku 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:50.820
 take the next strand of hair and the same 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:53.820
 way we wrap it closer to the root 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.820
 we remove 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:02.350
 in the rezinochku 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:14.730
 we do the same with everyone 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:16.950
 the rest of the strands, I advise you to remove 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:20.360
 not too small locks because 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:20.360
 it will be difficult for you to distribute later 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:26.310
 hair does rezinochki this way 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:32.180
 that it was not visible that they chose one by one 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:39.800
 pryadochki and hair will look 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:46.290
 more solid in principle we all 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:47.750
 we wrap the penultimate strand hiding 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:52.850
 her 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:56.720
 rezinochku undertake the last strand 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:56.720
 neatly fold you 

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:15.010
 distribute evenly hidden 

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:18.010
 hair 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:18.010
 rezinochki 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:28.120
 hairstyle keeps well and looks 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:33.780
 very beautiful 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:36.640
 if you want more 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:38.500
 bulk you can not much fill 

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:42.239
