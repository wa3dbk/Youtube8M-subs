this you may want to check every 15 20
seconds<00:04:57.030> or<00:04:57.150> so<00:04:57.180> how<00:04:57.570> it's<00:04:57.720> going<00:04:58.110> but<00:04:59.070> I<00:04:59.280> know

00:04:59.360 --> 00:04:59.370 
seconds or so how it's going but I know

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:04.760 
seconds or so how it's going but I know
it'll<00:04:59.729> be<00:04:59.760> fine<00:05:01.669> all<00:05:02.669> right<00:05:03.350> cut<00:05:04.350> this<00:05:04.470> one<00:05:04.650> up

a<00:05:04.860> lot<00:05:04.979> better<00:05:05.160> than<00:05:05.370> last<00:05:05.400> one<00:05:05.850> huh<00:05:06.030> I<00:05:07.310> think

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:08.310 
a lot better than last one huh I think

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:12.320 
a lot better than last one huh I think
it'll<00:05:08.550> look<00:05:08.990> yes<00:05:09.990> as<00:05:10.400> you<00:05:11.400> can<00:05:11.580> see<00:05:11.760> that's

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:12.330 
it'll look yes as you can see that's

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:14.870 
it'll look yes as you can see that's
good<00:05:12.900> enough<00:05:13.050> for<00:05:13.229> now<00:05:13.680> they<00:05:14.370> will<00:05:14.490> now<00:05:14.610> just

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:14.880 
good enough for now they will now just

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:17.180 
good enough for now they will now just
flip<00:05:15.060> it<00:05:15.150> over<00:05:15.270> the<00:05:15.510> other<00:05:15.540> way<00:05:15.900> and<00:05:16.229> put<00:05:16.979> it<00:05:17.070> on

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:17.190 
flip it over the other way and put it on

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:19.779 
flip it over the other way and put it on
again<00:05:17.460> to<00:05:17.639> get<00:05:17.790> the<00:05:17.910> other<00:05:18.090> side<00:05:18.650> since<00:05:19.650> the

00:05:19.779 --> 00:05:19.789 
again to get the other side since the

00:05:19.789 --> 00:05:22.400 
again to get the other side since the
the<00:05:20.789> side<00:05:21.000> on<00:05:21.180> the<00:05:21.300> back<00:05:21.450> is<00:05:21.750> getting<00:05:22.020> most<00:05:22.169> of

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:22.410 
the side on the back is getting most of

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:23.930 
the side on the back is getting most of
the<00:05:22.470> heat<00:05:22.680> this<00:05:23.340> way<00:05:23.520> it's<00:05:23.669> at<00:05:23.760> least

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:23.940 
the heat this way it's at least

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:27.080 
the heat this way it's at least
relatively<00:05:24.450> evenly<00:05:24.810> distributed<00:05:25.500> oh<00:05:26.090> wow

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:27.090 
relatively evenly distributed oh wow

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:28.550 
relatively evenly distributed oh wow
this<00:05:27.270> tortilla<00:05:27.630> is<00:05:27.780> a<00:05:27.810> lot<00:05:27.960> smaller<00:05:28.289> than<00:05:28.410> the

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:28.560 
this tortilla is a lot smaller than the

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:30.469 
this tortilla is a lot smaller than the
last<00:05:28.740> one<00:05:29.010> was<00:05:29.160> so<00:05:29.880> you<00:05:29.970> don't<00:05:30.120> have<00:05:30.210> to<00:05:30.330> worry

00:05:30.469 --> 00:05:30.479 
last one was so you don't have to worry

00:05:30.479 --> 00:05:31.610 
last one was so you don't have to worry
if<00:05:30.600> you<00:05:30.660> have<00:05:30.750> a<00:05:30.810> little<00:05:31.050> bit<00:05:31.140> of<00:05:31.260> a<00:05:31.320> hole<00:05:31.470> on

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:31.620 
if you have a little bit of a hole on

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:33.230 
if you have a little bit of a hole on
top<00:05:31.650> that's<00:05:32.130> why<00:05:32.280> I<00:05:32.340> prefer<00:05:32.729> to<00:05:32.820> use<00:05:32.880> a<00:05:32.970> whole

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:33.240 
top that's why I prefer to use a whole

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:35.240 
top that's why I prefer to use a whole
piece<00:05:33.990> of<00:05:34.020> lettuce<00:05:34.289> instead<00:05:34.800> of<00:05:34.919> shredded

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:35.250 
piece of lettuce instead of shredded

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:36.700 
piece of lettuce instead of shredded
lettuce<00:05:35.430> like<00:05:35.729> they<00:05:35.880> do<00:05:36.030> with<00:05:36.150> Taco<00:05:36.360> Bell

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:36.710 
lettuce like they do with Taco Bell

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:39.310 
lettuce like they do with Taco Bell
because<00:05:37.710> the<00:05:37.890> lettuce<00:05:38.190> keeps<00:05:38.460> all<00:05:38.700> the

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:39.320 
because the lettuce keeps all the

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:42.700 
because the lettuce keeps all the
slightly<00:05:40.320> more<00:05:40.470> messy<00:05:41.039> stuff<00:05:41.370> out<00:05:41.880> of<00:05:42.120> the<00:05:42.210> way

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:42.710 
slightly more messy stuff out of the way

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:45.740 
slightly more messy stuff out of the way
and<00:05:43.710> if<00:05:43.860> you<00:05:43.979> got<00:05:44.130> one<00:05:44.340> ready<00:05:44.580> have<00:05:45.360> nowhere<00:05:45.600> to

00:05:46.139 --> 00:05:47.960 
put it
yeah<00:05:46.200> just<00:05:46.410> flip<00:05:46.620> it<00:05:46.740> upside<00:05:47.039> down<00:05:47.070> it'll<00:05:47.820> keep

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:47.970 
yeah just flip it upside down it'll keep

00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:56.500
