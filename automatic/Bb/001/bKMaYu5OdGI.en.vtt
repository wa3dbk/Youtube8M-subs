00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.449
 hello everyone to sfax we find ourselves for 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:05.009
 a little video to talk to you a little 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:07.740
 of my projects since ball to this 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:09.780
 this time here is the update 2 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.580
 dofus points 29 is coming soon 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.500
 that said we expect it to be at least 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.030
 already two weeks that I wait for him and 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.529
 five shot I do not know too much 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.359
 what to do like video even if I you 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:21.060
 have even swayed a lot of videos on 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:22.710
 my youtube channel with updates 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.109
 from 2.29 there I am a little bit 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.099
 stuck so I redid a little I 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:28.230
 wanted to redo a little video for 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:31.019
 to find new ones 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.399
 projects to put on my channel on my 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:33.510
 youtube channel and especially on my lives 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.340
 because that 's where I'm doing a little less 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.230
 of age because I do not have too much 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.629
 content to make you discover I had 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.340
 well there 2.29 I still have my tips 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:43.500
 kama but it bothers me to do that 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.789
 because down after we'll turn a 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.120
 little bit in circles we will always fall 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:49.260
 on the same kama tips so I saw myself 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.520
 I do not really know what to do in two 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.980
 done I told myself that I'm reviving and 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.020
 to mount a new character so 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.910
 still mono content so it will be 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.770
 really good for you that those who 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.930
 finally watch who play in mono account 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.350
 and who do they prefer jeanmonod account 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.629
 anyway 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.670
 so we'll talk about it we'll talk about it 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:08.670
 just now but suddenly I would like 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:10.380
 have your opinion on which character I 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.960
 can play in words so does count 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:15.000
 knowing that I would not take pandawa 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:16.740
 passage of ida and pike africa saw that this 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.590
 are already my three main perso 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.299
 I had thought it operates there all 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.979
 just because ben in my team 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:25.770
 I have not yet staff 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:28.770
 and then it changes diop well it's a good 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.659
 tft refuses well known there operate this 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.610
 can still be nice to them 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:35.820
 swords selects the sword of judgment that taps 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:38.670
 through the walls and pays the countries 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:40.290
 whose pc is that type in zone and 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.420
 the divine sword that gives damage that 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.350
 can be calm pretty cool so me 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.390
 I thought there are operating 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.430
 after you can make proposals 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.680
 in the comments or on twitter there 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.869
 no worries and then also I find 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.540
 in quotation marks a good idea so I 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:56.460
 will perhaps take this character in 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:58.020
 the goal of this character because it 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.909
 that I had already made series where I 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.549
 start a new character there 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:04.409
 savard unless you ride for for 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:06.390
 several tricks it'll be 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:07.680
 first the parceleum thing that I do 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.849
 very little on my youtube channel so 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.830
 this is why the age of power 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:12.840
 resume a new character and then 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.560
 do coliseum to me bats level so that 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.569
 may be 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.220
 little nice it will change big level 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:19.050
 and then so I'm not it's 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:21.420
 fort in coliseum game for the moment for 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:24.000
 handle the real the real parcels at the 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:25.500
 level is so the goal it's going to be 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.090
 spend a lot of millions 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:29.580
 of my case in this character 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:31.200
 so here I already had a budget of 200 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:33.660
 million cases me I think at least 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:34.230
 have spent 100 million for this new 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:37.080
 character 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:39.930
 so as you can see I already have 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:42.300
 prepared all the dofus so level 6 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:43.830
 years my father what will be solo will have to 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:45.720
 1.2 fuses ice cream in two threads 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:48.420
 emerald with two chips pop point phuoc 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:50.580
 re 1,2 up to watts and 1,2 was this on 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:52.380
 what are we going to parachute him to 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:54.900
 maximum end the goal is to make a 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:56.519
 super optimized character and that from the 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:59.310
 start to really not be bored in 

00:02:56.519 --> 00:03:00.750
 the fights and then always go do 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:02.670
 dungeons a little stronger than my 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:03.989
 level it could be nice it'll do 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:05.760
 a challenge and me it will allow me 

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:08.010
 to really not be bored of having a 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:11.190
 real mission and I think that live it 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:12.930
 can be super nice so that's it for 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:15.390
 my character so maybe elsewhere father 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:16.620
 you give me your proposals and so 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:19.290
 I just wanted to redo a little point 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:21.150
 so on following my projects since 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:23.040
 it's going to be the holidays over there 2.29 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:24.570
 so there will be a lot of content that 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:26.549
 will be super nice for me anyway 

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:28.680
 more for you too if you like video 

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:31.140
 so we're going to make a little pea so here 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:32.609
 here are the videos coming a little on on 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:33.989
 my youtube channel so I divided into 

00:03:32.609 --> 00:03:35.850
 four categories 

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:37.980
 what you will see most in any case 

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:40.280
 at the beginning it's really going to be the tutorials 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:43.319
 2.29 this is what will interest me 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:45.389
 updates key key pau 29 

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:47.459
 will go out I'll go up all the 

00:03:45.389 --> 00:03:49.079
 level 201 parent jobs so it's going to be 

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:50.310
 a little bit of shade that will have to 

00:03:49.079 --> 00:03:52.850
 take your trouble 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:54.810
 we will start with jeweler shoemaker 

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:55.859
 alchemist elsewhere all this and then after 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:58.100
 we will go into the trades of more 

00:03:55.859 --> 00:04:00.060
 specific handyman style or 

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:02.609
 sculptors do the craft a little bit 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:05.010
 less a little less used so 

00:04:02.609 --> 00:04:06.690
 so that's all joly trades would do 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:08.850
 in video and I redo rilke stars 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:11.700
 wrote on my website face you 

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:12.989
 this point fr so that's why for those 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:15.120
 who are not interested in the trades 

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:16.769
 in parallel I will always do 

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:19.229
 Camara tricks as I do 

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:21.750
 regularly I do pretty much I 

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:24.570
 would say 4.5 maybe even more one will 

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:25.680
 say 4.5 video kama tips per month where 

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:27.240
 I try to make you gain a maximum 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:28.949
 sub 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:30.840
 and as promised I will do my 

00:04:28.949 --> 00:04:33.509
 new full-time message series of 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:35.310
 points 29 so that's going to be gone from 0 to 

00:04:33.509 --> 00:04:37.139
 1 million carats being non-subscribers 

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:39.210
 like that it will allow people 

00:04:37.139 --> 00:04:41.250
 who have trouble subscribing to subscribe 

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:42.840
 a first time thanks to kamas or 

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:46.050
 if they do not want to subscribe anyway 

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:48.210
 to win kamas simply so 

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:49.979
 in the third category we saw the xp of 

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:52.740
 new person so the goal is going to be 

00:04:49.979 --> 00:04:55.560
 the icsp oslo les coliseum to make the 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:57.780
 dungeons the successes and in addition maybe 

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:59.250
 if it's going to be nice enough we'll be here 

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:01.020
 in the period is going to be the idols 

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:03.180
 so it'll be different again for 

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:05.370
 solo experience it's going to be that should 

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:07.979
 be not too bad we'll see we'll see 

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:10.050
 all this and then the last category 

00:05:07.979 --> 00:05:12.690
 so that's the news and various and 

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:14.250
 the videos not too expected that's when 

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:15.930
 I speak for example of dragoturts or 

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:17.580
 idols nine anyway stuff 

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:18.479
 that do not account in all three 

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:21.090
 other categories 

00:05:18.479 --> 00:05:23.280
 so here's the rest of my videos 

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:26.310
 so you tell me for the new person 

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:27.930
 I think it started Saturday live 

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:30.270
 and then we will surely wait there 

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:31.860
 2.29 to continue to use the 

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:33.240
 idols in any case the first level 

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:35.340
 can fit quite easily 

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:37.380
 especially I'm going to xp you maybe x 

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:39.509
 4 at the beginning so at the beginning it's going to be 

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:42.419
 quite simple especially with all the dofus 

00:05:39.509 --> 00:05:44.699
 and the bumpers and then afterwards 

00:05:42.419 --> 00:05:46.620
 will arrive with the update so for 

00:05:44.699 --> 00:05:48.000
 those who wonder about the update 

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:50.159
 still does not have an official date 

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.169
 normally it was along we are already 

00:05:50.159 --> 00:05:54.210
 June 16th so that's missed so 

00:05:52.169 --> 00:05:56.130
 maybe the 23rd of June that is to say the 

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:57.750
 next week and if ever it's not 

00:05:56.130 --> 00:05:59.069
 the case on June 30 for now it's 

00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:00.750
 true that she still pushed back we did not 

00:05:59.069 --> 00:06:02.580
 still no official date 

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:04.680
 So, thanks to all of you for having followed 

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:07.020
 this video will be found very soon 

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:09.000
 for them all the rest with the videos 

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:12.440
 will do the projects that I have stated 

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.440
 in this video so that's him
