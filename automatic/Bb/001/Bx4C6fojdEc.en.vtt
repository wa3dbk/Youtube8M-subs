00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
three petals together that's how you

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:30.890 
three petals together that's how you
make<00:00:29.519> it<00:00:29.640> Rose<00:00:29.820> you'd<00:00:30.029> have<00:00:30.240> your<00:00:30.390> stem<00:00:30.660> come

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
miscellaneous colors in it so this will

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.499 
miscellaneous colors in it so this will
be<00:01:26.970> my<00:01:27.150> second<00:01:27.750> row<00:01:28.680> and<00:01:29.130> then<00:01:29.640> I'll<00:01:30.299> do<00:01:30.479> my

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
be my second row and then I'll do my

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:33.980 
be my second row and then I'll do my
third<00:01:31.470> row<00:01:31.710> and<00:01:32.100> my<00:01:32.340> first<00:01:32.579> row<00:01:32.759> so<00:01:32.970> my<00:01:33.509> top<00:01:33.780> row

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
third row and my first row so my top row

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.510 
third row and my first row so my top row
and<00:01:34.229> my<00:01:34.380> bottom<00:01:34.680> row<00:01:34.710> will<00:01:34.979> have<00:01:35.009> matching

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
and my bottom row will have matching

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.100 
and my bottom row will have matching
colors<00:01:35.850> and<00:01:36.119> then<00:01:36.270> the<00:01:36.420> middle<00:01:36.630> one<00:01:36.659> will

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
colors and then the middle one will

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.640 
colors and then the middle one will
offset<00:01:37.920> it<00:01:38.040> with<00:01:38.189> the<00:01:38.340> miscellaneous<00:01:39.180> colors

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:39.650 
offset it with the miscellaneous colors

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:44.539 
offset it with the miscellaneous colors
okay<00:01:40.650> and<00:01:41.570> then<00:01:42.570> I<00:01:42.750> got<00:01:42.899> a<00:01:43.020> stem<00:01:43.409> which<00:01:43.439> you<00:01:44.399> can

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
okay and then I got a stem which you can

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.310 
okay and then I got a stem which you can
do<00:01:44.640> it<00:01:44.729> one<00:01:44.880> or<00:01:44.909> two<00:01:45.030> ways<00:01:45.299> you<00:01:45.479> can<00:01:45.630> continue

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
do it one or two ways you can continue

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.950 
do it one or two ways you can continue
to<00:01:46.439> build<00:01:46.649> your<00:01:46.860> stem<00:01:47.040> on<00:01:47.220> this<00:01:47.430> one<00:01:47.670> here<00:01:48.240> or

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
to build your stem on this one here or

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.100 
to build your stem on this one here or
you<00:01:49.200> can<00:01:49.350> just<00:01:49.530> take<00:01:50.159> a<00:01:50.189> piece<00:01:50.460> of<00:01:50.490> scrap<00:01:51.110> about

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
you can just take a piece of scrap about

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.819 
you can just take a piece of scrap about
handling<00:01:52.710> bubble<00:01:53.310> or<00:01:53.430> soap<00:01:53.759> on<00:01:54.509> that<00:01:54.960> okay

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
then this this is to ground mocha Brown

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.600 
then this this is to ground mocha Brown
bubbles<00:02:00.950> made<00:02:01.950> into<00:02:02.189> a<00:02:02.250> box

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610
