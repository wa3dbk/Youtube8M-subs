includes<00:02:18.390> both<00:02:18.930> effect<00:02:19.350> that<00:02:19.860> we<00:02:20.040> are<00:02:20.160> to

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
includes both effect that we are to

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:23.120 
includes both effect that we are to
repent<00:02:20.760> of<00:02:20.940> our<00:02:21.090> sins<00:02:21.450> and<00:02:21.840> we<00:02:22.560> are<00:02:22.650> to<00:02:22.830> place

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:03.440 
the flop a parachute on because you know
