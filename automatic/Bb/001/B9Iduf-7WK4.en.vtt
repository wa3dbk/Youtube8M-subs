designed to show you how to ring a

00:00:15.699 --> 00:00:18.240 
designed to show you how to ring a
simple<00:00:16.090> aircraft<00:00:16.710> introduce<00:00:17.710> you<00:00:17.859> to<00:00:18.070> the

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:18.250 
simple aircraft introduce you to the

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:20.670 
simple aircraft introduce you to the
concepts<00:00:18.910> of<00:00:19.029> unity<00:00:19.359> FS<00:00:19.689> and<00:00:19.960> just<00:00:20.439> to<00:00:20.560> the

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:20.680 
concepts of unity FS and just to the

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:22.859 
concepts of unity FS and just to the
power<00:00:21.130> of<00:00:21.279> its<00:00:21.400> functionality<00:00:21.820> so<00:00:22.689> in<00:00:22.779> this

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:22.869 
power of its functionality so in this

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:24.300 
power of its functionality so in this
first<00:00:23.140> that<00:00:23.529> shatori<00:00:23.830> we're<00:00:23.980> just<00:00:24.099> going<00:00:24.279> to

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:24.310 
first that shatori we're just going to

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:26.609 
first that shatori we're just going to
look<00:00:24.490> at<00:00:24.699> the<00:00:24.880> very<00:00:25.060> basics<00:00:25.509> of<00:00:25.689> how<00:00:25.990> to<00:00:26.289> begin

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:26.619 
look at the very basics of how to begin

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:28.919 
look at the very basics of how to begin
creating<00:00:27.310> a<00:00:27.490> new<00:00:27.519> aircraft<00:00:27.849> in<00:00:28.269> unity<00:00:28.630> affairs

00:00:28.919 --> 00:00:28.929 
creating a new aircraft in unity affairs

00:00:28.929 --> 00:00:32.540 
creating a new aircraft in unity affairs
so<00:00:29.769> I've<00:00:30.099> just<00:00:30.130> got<00:00:30.429> unity<00:00:31.210> open<00:00:31.659> version<00:00:31.869> 3.5

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
so I've just got unity open version 3.5

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.819 
so I've just got unity open version 3.5
I've<00:00:33.550> extracted<00:00:34.000> my<00:00:34.270> unity<00:00:34.630> FS<00:00:34.840> package<00:00:35.230> which

00:00:35.819 --> 00:00:35.829 
I've extracted my unity FS package which

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:37.470 
I've extracted my unity FS package which
you<00:00:35.860> can<00:00:36.160> see<00:00:36.400> down<00:00:36.640> here<00:00:36.700> in<00:00:37.060> the<00:00:37.120> project

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:37.480 
you can see down here in the project

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:39.660 
you can see down here in the project
view<00:00:37.510> and<00:00:38.260> I've<00:00:38.350> just<00:00:38.470> got<00:00:38.649> the<00:00:38.829> default<00:00:39.280> scene

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:39.670 
view and I've just got the default scene

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:41.430 
view and I've just got the default scene
open<00:00:40.149> which<00:00:40.600> you<00:00:40.750> can<00:00:40.899> see<00:00:41.079> here<00:00:41.260> we've<00:00:41.410> just

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:41.440 
open which you can see here we've just

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:42.630 
open which you can see here we've just
got<00:00:41.710> the<00:00:41.829> main<00:00:42.010> camera

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:42.640 
got the main camera

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:44.819 
got the main camera
the<00:00:43.510> first<00:00:43.690> thing<00:00:43.780> I'm<00:00:43.840> going<00:00:43.930> to<00:00:43.989> do<00:00:44.170> is<00:00:44.410> that

00:00:44.819 --> 00:00:44.829 
the first thing I'm going to do is that

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:47.520 
the first thing I'm going to do is that
delete<00:00:45.219> the<00:00:45.760> main<00:00:45.969> camera<00:00:46.239> and<00:00:46.539> open<00:00:47.230> up<00:00:47.320> the

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:47.530 
delete the main camera and open up the

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:50.790 
delete the main camera and open up the
Edit<00:00:47.800> EFS<00:00:48.250> directory<00:00:49.079> in<00:00:50.079> the<00:00:50.199> prefabs<00:00:50.680> folder

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:50.800 
Edit EFS directory in the prefabs folder

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:53.250 
Edit EFS directory in the prefabs folder
you'll<00:00:51.579> find<00:00:51.940> that<00:00:52.149> there<00:00:52.359> is<00:00:52.390> a<00:00:52.629> prefab

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:53.260 
you'll find that there is a prefab

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.169 
you'll find that there is a prefab
called<00:00:53.559> test<00:00:53.829> scene<00:00:54.039> objects<00:00:54.519> you<00:00:54.910> don't<00:00:55.059> have

00:00:55.169 --> 00:00:55.179 
called test scene objects you don't have

00:00:55.179 --> 00:00:57.599 
called test scene objects you don't have
to<00:00:55.300> use<00:00:55.390> this<00:00:55.539> but<00:00:55.829> you<00:00:56.829> drag<00:00:57.070> this<00:00:57.219> into<00:00:57.489> the

00:00:57.599 --> 00:00:57.609 
to use this but you drag this into the

00:00:57.609 --> 00:00:58.860 
to use this but you drag this into the
scene<00:00:57.850> you'll<00:00:58.030> see<00:00:58.179> that<00:00:58.359> this<00:00:58.420> is<00:00:58.600> just<00:00:58.629> a

00:00:58.860 --> 00:00:58.870 
scene you'll see that this is just a

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:01.979 
scene you'll see that this is just a
very<00:00:59.199> simple<00:00:59.469> I'm<00:01:00.429> seeing<00:01:00.789> the<00:01:01.120> mix<00:01:01.390> aircraft

00:01:01.979 --> 00:01:01.989 
very simple I'm seeing the mix aircraft

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:03.840 
very simple I'm seeing the mix aircraft
creation<00:01:02.379> even<00:01:02.800> easier<00:01:03.160> said<00:01:03.460> it's<00:01:03.609> just<00:01:03.670> a

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:03.850 
creation even easier said it's just a

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:06.330 
creation even easier said it's just a
plane<00:01:04.059> in<00:01:04.239> here<00:01:04.420> a<00:01:04.629> camera<00:01:05.320> with<00:01:05.440> a<00:01:05.470> skybox<00:01:05.800> and

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:06.340 
plane in here a camera with a skybox and

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:09.660 
plane in here a camera with a skybox and
a<00:01:06.490> little<00:01:06.790> of<00:01:06.880> text<00:01:08.130> so<00:01:09.130> now<00:01:09.160> we've<00:01:09.490> got<00:01:09.640> a

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:09.670 
a little of text so now we've got a

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:11.880 
a little of text so now we've got a
scene<00:01:09.940> we<00:01:10.210> can<00:01:10.240> look<00:01:10.600> at<00:01:10.869> they're<00:01:11.229> creating<00:01:11.770> an

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:11.890 
scene we can look at they're creating an

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:14.399 
scene we can look at they're creating an
aircraft<00:01:12.369> and<00:01:13.329> to<00:01:13.450> do<00:01:13.540> that<00:01:13.689> again<00:01:14.049> in<00:01:14.290> the

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:14.409 
aircraft and to do that again in the

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:16.050 
aircraft and to do that again in the
preface<00:01:14.619> folder<00:01:15.130> there's<00:01:15.700> an<00:01:15.850> aircraft

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:16.060 
preface folder there's an aircraft

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:18.510 
preface folder there's an aircraft
directory<00:01:16.869> and<00:01:17.799> in<00:01:17.979> here<00:01:18.220> there's<00:01:18.460> a

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:18.520 
directory and in here there's a

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:20.640 
directory and in here there's a
templates<00:01:18.970> directory<00:01:19.479> which<00:01:20.140> has<00:01:20.170> two

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:20.650 
templates directory which has two

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:23.100 
templates directory which has two
templates<00:01:21.250> for<00:01:22.000> aircraft<00:01:22.390> creation<00:01:22.840> that's

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:23.110 
templates for aircraft creation that's

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:25.230 
templates for aircraft creation that's
the<00:01:23.229> empty<00:01:23.590> template<00:01:24.009> and<00:01:24.430> also<00:01:24.700> the<00:01:24.820> basic

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:25.240 
the empty template and also the basic

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:28.050 
the empty template and also the basic
template<00:01:26.189> so<00:01:27.189> just<00:01:27.520> to<00:01:27.579> give<00:01:27.759> you<00:01:27.790> a<00:01:27.880> little

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:28.060 
template so just to give you a little

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:30.990 
template so just to give you a little
insight<00:01:28.450> into<00:01:28.890> the<00:01:29.890> structure<00:01:30.280> if<00:01:30.549> we<00:01:30.700> pull<00:01:30.880> in

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:31.000 
insight into the structure if we pull in

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.749 
insight into the structure if we pull in
the<00:01:31.090> empty<00:01:31.509> template<00:01:31.960> you'll<00:01:32.890> see<00:01:33.159> that<00:01:33.399> this

00:01:33.749 --> 00:01:33.759 
the empty template you'll see that this

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:35.730 
the empty template you'll see that this
creates<00:01:34.119> that<00:01:34.299> game<00:01:34.479> object<00:01:34.630> which<00:01:35.439> has<00:01:35.590> an

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:35.740 
creates that game object which has an

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:38.100 
creates that game object which has an
aircraft<00:01:36.189> component<00:01:36.670> monocle<00:01:37.000> and<00:01:37.210> also<00:01:38.079> a

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:38.110 
aircraft component monocle and also a

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:41.490 
aircraft component monocle and also a
rigidbody<00:01:38.680> component<00:01:39.100> on<00:01:39.670> it<00:01:39.960> if<00:01:40.960> we<00:01:41.140> open<00:01:41.409> it

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:41.500 
rigidbody component on it if we open it

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:44.429 
rigidbody component on it if we open it
up<00:01:41.649> we'll<00:01:42.340> see<00:01:42.549> that<00:01:42.729> the<00:01:42.939> aircraft<00:01:43.719> prefab

00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:44.439 
up we'll see that the aircraft prefab

00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:46.830 
up we'll see that the aircraft prefab
has<00:01:44.619> four<00:01:44.860> children<00:01:44.979> camera<00:01:45.969> dynamics<00:01:46.659> and

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:46.840 
has four children camera dynamics and

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:49.740 
has four children camera dynamics and
model<00:01:47.110> and<00:01:47.320> wheels<00:01:47.850> these<00:01:48.850> are<00:01:48.909> essentially

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:49.750 
model and wheels these are essentially

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:51.209 
model and wheels these are essentially
treated<00:01:50.079> as<00:01:50.170> folders<00:01:50.590> to<00:01:50.710> help<00:01:50.740> you<00:01:51.009> organize

00:01:51.209 --> 00:01:51.219 
treated as folders to help you organize

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:54.600 
treated as folders to help you organize
your<00:01:51.430> aircraft<00:01:52.000> and<00:01:52.170> each<00:01:53.170> folder<00:01:53.710> is

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:54.610 
your aircraft and each folder is

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:56.520 
your aircraft and each folder is
arranged<00:01:55.210> in<00:01:55.270> such<00:01:55.509> a<00:01:55.539> way<00:01:55.780> to<00:01:55.840> store<00:01:56.289> the

arranged in such a way to store the
specific<00:01:57.219> items<00:01:57.610> which<00:01:57.880> we're<00:01:58.090> all<00:01:58.119> attached

00:01:58.529 --> 00:01:58.539 
specific items which we're all attached

00:01:58.539 --> 00:01:59.730 
specific items which we're all attached
to<00:01:58.719> our<00:01:58.750> aircraft<00:01:59.320> so

00:01:59.730 --> 00:01:59.740 
to our aircraft so

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:01.649 
to our aircraft so
cameras<00:02:00.280> will<00:02:00.430> live<00:02:00.549> in<00:02:00.670> the<00:02:00.759> cameras<00:02:01.090> folder

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:01.659 
cameras will live in the cameras folder

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:03.899 
cameras will live in the cameras folder
dynamics<00:02:02.320> which<00:02:02.500> are<00:02:02.649> things<00:02:02.799> like<00:02:02.920> wings<00:02:03.640> and

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:03.909 
dynamics which are things like wings and

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:06.690 
dynamics which are things like wings and
I<00:02:03.969> love<00:02:04.119> physical<00:02:04.570> objects<00:02:05.399> will<00:02:06.399> live<00:02:06.579> in

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:06.700 
I love physical objects will live in

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:09.150 
I love physical objects will live in
here<00:02:07.030> model<00:02:07.750> which<00:02:08.170> is<00:02:08.289> the<00:02:08.410> actual<00:02:08.649> 3d<00:02:08.890> model

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:09.160 
here model which is the actual 3d model

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:10.529 
here model which is the actual 3d model
of<00:02:09.250> the<00:02:09.369> aircraft<00:02:09.460> will<00:02:09.850> live<00:02:09.940> in<00:02:10.060> here<00:02:10.270> and

00:02:10.529 --> 00:02:10.539 
of the aircraft will live in here and

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:12.870 
of the aircraft will live in here and
unities<00:02:11.410> we're<00:02:11.890> colliders<00:02:12.400> will<00:02:12.580> live<00:02:12.760> in

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:12.880 
unities we're colliders will live in

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:16.259 
unities we're colliders will live in
here<00:02:13.120> so<00:02:13.840> this<00:02:13.990> is<00:02:14.140> the<00:02:14.320> bare<00:02:14.800> minimum<00:02:15.150> that<00:02:16.150> we

00:02:16.259 --> 00:02:16.269 
here so this is the bare minimum that we

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:17.820 
here so this is the bare minimum that we
need<00:02:16.420> in<00:02:16.720> order<00:02:16.840> to<00:02:17.050> create<00:02:17.319> our<00:02:17.440> aircraft

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:17.830 
need in order to create our aircraft

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:20.000 
need in order to create our aircraft
we're<00:02:18.640> just<00:02:18.790> going<00:02:18.910> to<00:02:18.940> delete<00:02:19.090> that<00:02:19.239> and<00:02:19.629> it's

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
we're just going to delete that and it's

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.009 
we're just going to delete that and it's
then<00:02:20.159> pull<00:02:20.489> in<00:02:20.610> the<00:02:20.730> basic<00:02:21.150> prefab<00:02:21.599> which<00:02:21.810> give

00:02:22.009 --> 00:02:22.019 
then pull in the basic prefab which give

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:24.350 
then pull in the basic prefab which give
us<00:02:22.049> a<00:02:22.260> little<00:02:22.409> bit<00:02:22.560> more<00:02:22.769> so<00:02:23.580> you'll<00:02:24.030> see<00:02:24.239> that

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
us a little bit more so you'll see that

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:28.160 
us a little bit more so you'll see that
this<00:02:24.480> is<00:02:24.659> got<00:02:24.900> a<00:02:25.200> wind<00:02:26.069> component<00:02:26.280> on<00:02:26.640> it<00:02:27.170> what

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
this is got a wind component on it what

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:29.839 
this is got a wind component on it what
you'll<00:02:28.319> get<00:02:28.439> into<00:02:28.590> more<00:02:28.739> detail<00:02:29.040> later<00:02:29.159> but

00:02:29.839 --> 00:02:29.849 
you'll get into more detail later but

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:31.550 
you'll get into more detail later but
also<00:02:30.000> if<00:02:30.209> we<00:02:30.329> open<00:02:30.629> it<00:02:30.750> up<00:02:30.900> you'll<00:02:31.110> see<00:02:31.170> in<00:02:31.439> the

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
also if we open it up you'll see in the

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.500 
also if we open it up you'll see in the
cameras<00:02:31.980> folder<00:02:32.340> there's<00:02:32.700> a<00:02:32.790> number<00:02:33.420> of

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
cameras folder there's a number of

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.289 
cameras folder there's a number of
cameras<00:02:33.900> in<00:02:34.019> there<00:02:34.200> and<00:02:34.680> if<00:02:34.799> we<00:02:34.950> open<00:02:35.069> up

00:02:35.289 --> 00:02:35.299 
cameras in there and if we open up

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:37.339 
cameras in there and if we open up
dynamics<00:02:36.299> you'll<00:02:36.450> see<00:02:36.629> that<00:02:36.810> the<00:02:36.989> center<00:02:37.319> of

00:02:37.339 --> 00:02:37.349 
dynamics you'll see that the center of

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:39.020 
dynamics you'll see that the center of
gravity<00:02:37.409> health<00:02:37.980> weighs<00:02:38.190> in<00:02:38.459> and<00:02:38.849> also

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
gravity health weighs in and also

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:42.500 
gravity health weighs in and also
there's<00:02:39.390> a<00:02:39.450> simple<00:02:40.049> engine<00:02:40.379> and<00:02:41.190> I<00:02:41.310> said<00:02:41.579> so<00:02:42.209> if

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
there's a simple engine and I said so if

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:44.630 
there's a simple engine and I said so if
we<00:02:42.659> select<00:02:42.840> our<00:02:43.140> basic<00:02:43.709> aircraft<00:02:44.220> we<00:02:44.430> can

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 
we select our basic aircraft we can

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:46.430 
we select our basic aircraft we can
rename<00:02:45.209> it<00:02:45.269> to<00:02:45.390> something<00:02:45.480> a<00:02:45.930> little<00:02:46.019> bit<00:02:46.200> more

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
rename it to something a little bit more

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:53.270 
rename it to something a little bit more
useful<00:02:46.590> like<00:02:47.010> tutorial<00:02:51.079> aircraft<00:02:52.129> and<00:02:53.129> then

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
useful like tutorial aircraft and then

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:54.500 
useful like tutorial aircraft and then
what<00:02:53.370> we're<00:02:53.459> going<00:02:53.579> to<00:02:53.609> do<00:02:53.760> is<00:02:53.940> just<00:02:54.090> position

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
what we're going to do is just position

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:58.039 
what we're going to do is just position
it<00:02:54.739> at<00:02:55.739> the<00:02:55.890> origin<00:02:56.400> of<00:02:56.519> the<00:02:56.790> scene<00:02:57.060> like<00:02:57.329> so<00:02:57.629> so

00:02:58.039 --> 00:02:58.049 
it at the origin of the scene like so so

00:02:58.049 --> 00:02:59.180 
it at the origin of the scene like so so
if<00:02:58.230> we<00:02:58.379> just<00:02:58.470> look<00:02:58.560> at<00:02:58.769> this<00:02:58.889> you<00:02:58.950> can<00:02:59.159> see

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
if we just look at this you can see

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:02.300 
if we just look at this you can see
there's<00:02:59.609> not<00:02:59.760> a<00:03:00.560> thing<00:03:01.560> exciting<00:03:02.040> going<00:03:02.190> on

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 
there's not a thing exciting going on

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:03.740 
there's not a thing exciting going on
there<00:03:02.489> than<00:03:02.700> they<00:03:02.790> went<00:03:02.970> but<00:03:03.269> you<00:03:03.450> can<00:03:03.599> see

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
there than they went but you can see

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:07.280 
there than they went but you can see
there's<00:03:03.959> a<00:03:04.049> few<00:03:04.200> cameras<00:03:04.680> so<00:03:05.959> so<00:03:06.959> now<00:03:07.049> we<00:03:07.139> have

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
there's a few cameras so so now we have

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:10.099 
there's a few cameras so so now we have
this<00:03:07.470> aircraft<00:03:08.459> component<00:03:09.030> setup<00:03:09.239> and<00:03:09.690> the

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:10.109 
this aircraft component setup and the

00:03:10.109 --> 00:03:11.539 
this aircraft component setup and the
folders<00:03:10.470> underneath<00:03:10.709> all<00:03:11.010> the<00:03:11.099> range<00:03:11.310> with<00:03:11.489> a

00:03:11.539 --> 00:03:11.549 
folders underneath all the range with a

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:13.190 
folders underneath all the range with a
couple<00:03:11.790> of<00:03:11.849> cameras<00:03:12.150> you<00:03:12.299> can<00:03:12.750> now<00:03:12.870> put<00:03:13.079> on<00:03:13.139> a

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
couple of cameras you can now put on a

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:17.000 
couple of cameras you can now put on a
model<00:03:13.500> which<00:03:13.680> we<00:03:13.859> want<00:03:14.069> to<00:03:14.129> use<00:03:14.220> to<00:03:14.840> fly<00:03:15.980> so<00:03:16.980> I

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
model which we want to use to fly so I

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:19.550 
model which we want to use to fly so I
went<00:03:17.310> on<00:03:17.370> the<00:03:17.459> internet<00:03:17.760> earlier<00:03:18.060> and<00:03:18.269> I<00:03:19.079> just

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 
went on the internet earlier and I just

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:21.770 
went on the internet earlier and I just
downloaded<00:03:19.859> a<00:03:19.980> model<00:03:20.310> of<00:03:20.430> a<00:03:20.909> simple<00:03:21.389> aircraft

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
downloaded a model of a simple aircraft

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:23.330 
downloaded a model of a simple aircraft
a<00:03:21.930> little<00:03:22.139> single-engine<00:03:22.470> aircraft<00:03:22.769> so<00:03:23.159> if<00:03:23.250> I

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 
a little single-engine aircraft so if I

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:25.129 
a little single-engine aircraft so if I
pull<00:03:23.549> that<00:03:23.579> and<00:03:23.849> drop<00:03:24.060> it<00:03:24.269> you<00:03:24.660> can<00:03:24.810> see<00:03:25.019> it

00:03:25.129 --> 00:03:25.139 
pull that and drop it you can see it

00:03:25.139 --> 00:03:27.890 
pull that and drop it you can see it
here<00:03:25.410> so<00:03:26.060> again<00:03:27.060> the<00:03:27.359> first<00:03:27.540> thing<00:03:27.690> we<00:03:27.750> want<00:03:27.870> to

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:27.900 
here so again the first thing we want to

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:30.289 
here so again the first thing we want to
do<00:03:28.049> is<00:03:28.349> just<00:03:28.790> put<00:03:29.790> this<00:03:29.849> in<00:03:30.030> the<00:03:30.120> center

00:03:30.289 --> 00:03:30.299 
do is just put this in the center

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:32.360 
do is just put this in the center
because<00:03:30.660> it<00:03:30.900> makes<00:03:31.109> attaching<00:03:32.040> it<00:03:32.160> a<00:03:32.190> bit

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370 
because it makes attaching it a bit

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:36.860 
because it makes attaching it a bit
easier<00:03:35.000> I'm<00:03:36.000> just<00:03:36.150> going<00:03:36.299> to<00:03:36.359> align<00:03:36.629> it<00:03:36.840> with

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870 
easier I'm just going to align it with

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:48.950 
easier I'm just going to align it with
our<00:03:37.470> aircraft<00:03:38.250> here

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:48.960 

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:50.970 

and<00:03:49.960> now<00:03:50.200> we've<00:03:50.350> done<00:03:50.500> that<00:03:50.560> we're<00:03:50.800> going<00:03:50.920> to

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:50.980 
and now we've done that we're going to

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:53.190 
and now we've done that we're going to
drag<00:03:51.220> it<00:03:51.370> into<00:03:51.580> the<00:03:52.120> model<00:03:52.390> directory<00:03:52.930> so<00:03:53.170> that

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:53.200 
drag it into the model directory so that

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:56.250 
drag it into the model directory so that
it<00:03:53.380> is<00:03:53.470> attached<00:03:53.890> to<00:03:54.370> our<00:03:54.700> new<00:03:55.540> tutorial

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:56.260 
it is attached to our new tutorial

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:57.930 
it is attached to our new tutorial
aircraft<00:03:56.650> template<00:03:57.100> so<00:03:57.459> we<00:03:57.610> just<00:03:57.730> drop<00:03:57.910> it

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:57.940 
aircraft template so we just drop it

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:00.210 
aircraft template so we just drop it
into<00:03:58.180> model<00:03:58.540> there<00:03:58.950> now<00:03:59.950> we've<00:04:00.069> done<00:04:00.160> that

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:00.220 
into model there now we've done that

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:01.320 
into model there now we've done that
we're<00:04:00.400> just<00:04:00.459> going<00:04:00.670> to<00:04:00.700> check<00:04:00.940> a<00:04:00.970> few<00:04:01.120> things

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:01.330 
we're just going to check a few things

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:02.670 
we're just going to check a few things
firstly<00:04:01.900> we're<00:04:02.020> gonna<00:04:02.140> check<00:04:02.350> that<00:04:02.410> the

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:02.680 
firstly we're gonna check that the

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:04.140 
firstly we're gonna check that the
aircraft<00:04:03.160> is<00:04:03.340> actually<00:04:03.670> pointing<00:04:03.850> in<00:04:04.090> the

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:04.150 
aircraft is actually pointing in the

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:05.520 
aircraft is actually pointing in the
right<00:04:04.270> direction<00:04:04.330> so<00:04:04.750> if<00:04:04.990> I<00:04:05.110> select<00:04:05.260> you

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:05.530 
right direction so if I select you

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:07.920 
right direction so if I select you
toriel<00:04:05.860> aircraft<00:04:06.250> and<00:04:06.490> the<00:04:07.360> can't<00:04:07.630> afford

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:07.930 
toriel aircraft and the can't afford

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:09.449 
toriel aircraft and the can't afford
access<00:04:08.140> we<00:04:08.470> can<00:04:08.620> see<00:04:08.800> that<00:04:08.920> the<00:04:09.040> model<00:04:09.340> is

00:04:09.449 --> 00:04:09.459 
access we can see that the model is

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:10.650 
access we can see that the model is
facing<00:04:09.910> the<00:04:10.000> right<00:04:10.120> way

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:10.660 
facing the right way

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:13.979 
facing the right way
if<00:04:11.320> it's<00:04:11.530> not<00:04:11.790> we<00:04:12.790> can<00:04:13.030> just<00:04:13.060> open<00:04:13.390> up<00:04:13.660> moral

00:04:13.979 --> 00:04:13.989 
if it's not we can just open up moral

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:16.080 
if it's not we can just open up moral
select<00:04:14.680> a<00:04:14.770> little<00:04:15.040> in<00:04:15.130> here<00:04:15.370> and<00:04:15.640> then<00:04:15.940> rotate

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:16.090 
select a little in here and then rotate

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:19.640 
select a little in here and then rotate
it<00:04:16.510> around<00:04:16.630> to<00:04:17.109> face<00:04:17.320> the<00:04:17.590> correct<00:04:17.919> direction

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:19.650 
it around to face the correct direction

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:21.810 
it around to face the correct direction
another<00:04:20.650> important<00:04:21.160> thing<00:04:21.220> to<00:04:21.370> check<00:04:21.519> in<00:04:21.700> this

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:21.820 
another important thing to check in this

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:23.760 
another important thing to check in this
stage<00:04:22.060> is<00:04:22.330> the<00:04:22.450> scale<00:04:22.720> of<00:04:22.840> the<00:04:22.900> model<00:04:23.050> and

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:23.770 
stage is the scale of the model and

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:25.140 
stage is the scale of the model and
often<00:04:24.100> actually<00:04:24.310> getting<00:04:24.520> rolls<00:04:24.700> is<00:04:24.850> free<00:04:25.060> of

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:25.150 
often actually getting rolls is free of

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:26.490 
often actually getting rolls is free of
the<00:04:25.270> internet<00:04:25.570> it<00:04:25.720> could<00:04:25.870> be<00:04:25.990> completely

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:26.500 
the internet it could be completely

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:28.710 
the internet it could be completely
different<00:04:26.560> scales<00:04:27.100> but<00:04:27.490> if<00:04:28.330> you<00:04:28.419> want<00:04:28.600> to

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:28.720 
different scales but if you want to

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:30.960 
different scales but if you want to
maximize<00:04:29.200> the<00:04:29.410> realism<00:04:29.740> of<00:04:30.310> the<00:04:30.669> fly

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:30.970 
maximize the realism of the fly

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:32.520 
maximize the realism of the fly
simulation<00:04:31.540> then<00:04:31.780> it's<00:04:31.930> important<00:04:32.320> that<00:04:32.350> this

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:32.530 
simulation then it's important that this

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:36.300 
simulation then it's important that this
model<00:04:32.770> is<00:04:32.980> the<00:04:33.040> correct<00:04:33.490> scale<00:04:34.050> so<00:04:35.050> on<00:04:35.320> this

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:36.310 
model is the correct scale so on this

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:38.610 
model is the correct scale so on this
one<00:04:36.490> thing<00:04:36.550> we<00:04:36.669> can<00:04:36.790> do<00:04:36.940> to<00:04:37.230> discover<00:04:38.230> that<00:04:38.410> is

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:38.620 
one thing we can do to discover that is

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:41.220 
one thing we can do to discover that is
if<00:04:38.770> we<00:04:38.919> just<00:04:39.010> go<00:04:39.190> to<00:04:39.250> the<00:04:39.460> Internet<00:04:39.850> and<00:04:40.080> we<00:04:41.080> can

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:41.230 
if we just go to the Internet and we can

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:42.659 
if we just go to the Internet and we can
look<00:04:41.380> at<00:04:41.500> the<00:04:41.560> wingspan<00:04:41.860> which<00:04:42.280> in<00:04:42.400> this<00:04:42.460> case

00:04:42.659 --> 00:04:42.669 
look at the wingspan which in this case

00:04:42.669 --> 00:04:44.700 
look at the wingspan which in this case
is<00:04:42.850> ten<00:04:43.030> point<00:04:43.270> nine<00:04:43.300> seven<00:04:43.780> and<00:04:43.900> just<00:04:44.500> see<00:04:44.680> how

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:44.710 
is ten point nine seven and just see how

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:47.580 
is ten point nine seven and just see how
that<00:04:45.100> relates<00:04:45.430> to<00:04:45.580> the<00:04:45.730> model<00:04:46.290> useful<00:04:47.290> trick

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:47.590 
that relates to the model useful trick

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:50.460 
that relates to the model useful trick
in<00:04:47.770> unity<00:04:48.210> it's<00:04:49.210> just<00:04:49.419> to<00:04:49.540> create<00:04:49.780> a<00:04:49.960> new<00:04:50.290> game

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:50.470 
in unity it's just to create a new game

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:53.610 
in unity it's just to create a new game
object<00:04:50.650> just<00:04:51.490> a<00:04:51.669> little<00:04:51.880> cube<00:04:52.260> set<00:04:53.260> it<00:04:53.350> to<00:04:53.500> the

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:53.620 
object just a little cube set it to the

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:57.180 
object just a little cube set it to the
center<00:04:54.160> and<00:04:54.450> then<00:04:55.450> if<00:04:55.570> we<00:04:55.690> scale<00:04:55.960> it<00:04:56.020> by<00:04:56.650> ten

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:57.190 
center and then if we scale it by ten

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:00.060 
center and then if we scale it by ten
point<00:04:57.430> nine<00:04:57.610> seven<00:04:57.910> you<00:04:58.660> can<00:04:58.840> see<00:04:59.110> how<00:04:59.800> that

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:00.070 
point nine seven you can see how that

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:02.340 
point nine seven you can see how that
relates<00:05:00.250> to<00:05:00.580> the<00:05:00.760> model<00:05:01.090> sometimes<00:05:02.080> these

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:02.350 
relates to the model sometimes these

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:03.750 
relates to the model sometimes these
will<00:05:02.500> be<00:05:02.620> a<00:05:02.650> massively<00:05:03.070> but<00:05:03.280> if<00:05:03.400> we<00:05:03.520> look<00:05:03.640> at

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:03.760 
will be a massively but if we look at

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:05.670 
will be a massively but if we look at
this<00:05:03.850> one<00:05:04.030> we<00:05:04.150> can<00:05:04.270> see<00:05:04.510> that<00:05:04.720> it's<00:05:05.229> not<00:05:05.410> that

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:05.680 
this one we can see that it's not that

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:07.980 
this one we can see that it's not that
far<00:05:05.950> up<00:05:06.190> and<00:05:06.340> talked<00:05:06.580> so<00:05:07.240> we<00:05:07.479> can<00:05:07.630> just<00:05:07.750> scale

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:07.990 
far up and talked so we can just scale

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:19.629 
far up and talked so we can just scale
at<00:05:08.110> the<00:05:08.200> models<00:05:08.440> fly<00:05:08.620> me

00:05:19.629 --> 00:05:19.639 

00:05:19.639 --> 00:05:21.999 

and<00:05:20.330> now<00:05:20.569> we<00:05:20.629> know<00:05:20.870> that<00:05:21.139> when<00:05:21.650> we<00:05:21.740> start

00:05:21.999 --> 00:05:22.009 
and now we know that when we start

00:05:22.009 --> 00:05:23.350 
and now we know that when we start
ringing<00:05:22.219> up<00:05:22.280> the<00:05:22.400> aircraft<00:05:22.789> but<00:05:23.000> it<00:05:23.120> is<00:05:23.240> going

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:23.360 
ringing up the aircraft but it is going

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:25.809 
ringing up the aircraft but it is going
to<00:05:23.449> be<00:05:23.599> the<00:05:23.750> correct<00:05:23.960> size<00:05:24.139> and<00:05:24.710> so<00:05:24.949> the<00:05:25.639> wings

00:05:25.809 --> 00:05:25.819 
to be the correct size and so the wings

00:05:25.819 --> 00:05:27.309 
to be the correct size and so the wings
and<00:05:26.000> everything<00:05:26.090> are<00:05:26.569> going<00:05:26.719> to<00:05:26.780> match<00:05:26.930> up<00:05:26.960> to

00:05:27.309 --> 00:05:27.319 
and everything are going to match up to

00:05:27.319 --> 00:05:28.899 
and everything are going to match up to
the<00:05:27.439> weight<00:05:27.650> and<00:05:27.949> the<00:05:28.520> weight<00:05:28.699> of<00:05:28.789> the

00:05:28.899 --> 00:05:28.909 
the weight and the weight of the

00:05:28.909 --> 00:05:31.450 
the weight and the weight of the

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:41.360 
you can see in here there are a couple

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:42.820 
you can see in here there are a couple
of<00:05:41.539> weights<00:05:41.750> we've<00:05:41.990> got<00:05:42.199> our<00:05:42.319> empty<00:05:42.620> weight

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:42.830 
of weights we've got our empty weight

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:46.119 
of weights we've got our empty weight
which<00:05:43.009> is<00:05:43.300> 547<00:05:44.300> kilograms<00:05:44.719> and<00:05:44.900> our<00:05:45.590> loaded

00:05:46.119 --> 00:05:46.129 
which is 547 kilograms and our loaded

00:05:46.129 --> 00:05:50.740 
which is 547 kilograms and our loaded
weight<00:05:46.310> which<00:05:46.669> is<00:05:47.710> 998<00:05:48.710> kilograms<00:05:49.629> so<00:05:50.629> we'll

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:50.750 
weight which is 998 kilograms so we'll

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:52.839 
weight which is 998 kilograms so we'll
pick<00:05:50.930> something<00:05:51.169> which<00:05:51.830> is<00:05:51.949> in<00:05:52.490> between<00:05:52.580> the

00:05:52.839 --> 00:05:52.849 
pick something which is in between the

00:05:52.849 --> 00:05:55.659 
pick something which is in between the
teeth<00:05:53.060> so<00:05:53.509> we'll<00:05:53.659> call<00:05:53.870> it<00:05:53.900> maybe<00:05:54.669> 900

00:05:55.659 --> 00:05:55.669 
teeth so we'll call it maybe 900

00:05:55.669 --> 00:05:59.619 
teeth so we'll call it maybe 900
kilograms<00:05:56.210> so<00:05:56.960> we<00:05:57.699> got<00:05:58.699> someone<00:05:59.090> inside<00:05:59.240> of

00:05:59.619 --> 00:05:59.629 
kilograms so we got someone inside of

00:05:59.629 --> 00:06:01.990 
kilograms so we got someone inside of
fuel<00:05:59.979> so<00:06:00.979> they're<00:06:01.129> coming<00:06:01.370> up<00:06:01.430> to<00:06:01.490> the<00:06:01.610> maximum

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:02.000 
fuel so they're coming up to the maximum

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.980 
fuel so they're coming up to the maximum
weight<00:06:03.340> and<00:06:04.340> that's<00:06:05.000> about<00:06:05.090> it<00:06:05.210> we've<00:06:05.539> now<00:06:05.750> got

00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:05.990 
weight and that's about it we've now got

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:08.080 
weight and that's about it we've now got
a<00:06:06.020> car<00:06:06.229> set<00:06:06.650> up<00:06:06.770> we've<00:06:07.310> got<00:06:07.490> the<00:06:07.580> model<00:06:07.849> in<00:06:07.939> its

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:08.090 
a car set up we've got the model in its

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:10.920 
a car set up we've got the model in its
directory<00:06:08.689> and<00:06:09.680> we<00:06:09.919> set<00:06:10.189> up<00:06:10.219> the<00:06:10.430> weight

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:10.930 
directory and we set up the weight

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:12.909 
directory and we set up the weight
another<00:06:11.930> useful<00:06:12.110> thing<00:06:12.289> we<00:06:12.409> can<00:06:12.529> do<00:06:12.620> quickly

00:06:12.909 --> 00:06:12.919 
another useful thing we can do quickly

00:06:12.919 --> 00:06:14.589 
another useful thing we can do quickly
actually<00:06:13.039> is<00:06:13.400> if<00:06:13.610> we<00:06:13.729> select<00:06:13.909> the<00:06:14.120> center<00:06:14.509> of

00:06:14.589 --> 00:06:14.599 
actually is if we select the center of

00:06:14.599 --> 00:06:17.679 
actually is if we select the center of
gravity<00:06:15.520> and<00:06:16.520> we<00:06:16.729> can<00:06:16.849> just<00:06:16.969> position<00:06:17.120> this<00:06:17.449> in

00:06:17.679 --> 00:06:17.689 
gravity and we can just position this in

00:06:17.689 --> 00:06:20.260 
gravity and we can just position this in
a<00:06:17.900> location<00:06:18.560> which<00:06:18.979> is<00:06:19.159> vaguely<00:06:19.580> sensible<00:06:20.120> for

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:20.270 
a location which is vaguely sensible for

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:21.580 
a location which is vaguely sensible for
the<00:06:20.330> aircraft<00:06:20.719> although<00:06:20.900> we<00:06:21.080> can<00:06:21.229> tweak<00:06:21.439> this

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:21.590 
the aircraft although we can tweak this

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:25.089 
the aircraft although we can tweak this
later<00:06:21.860> a<00:06:22.189> useful<00:06:23.150> tip<00:06:23.330> is<00:06:23.569> to<00:06:23.900> change<00:06:24.319> from<00:06:24.440> RGB

00:06:25.089 --> 00:06:25.099 
later a useful tip is to change from RGB

00:06:25.099 --> 00:06:28.209 
later a useful tip is to change from RGB
to<00:06:25.279> overdraw<00:06:25.879> and<00:06:26.690> then<00:06:27.500> we<00:06:27.620> can<00:06:27.770> position<00:06:27.919> the

00:06:28.209 --> 00:06:28.219 
to overdraw and then we can position the

00:06:28.219 --> 00:06:30.999 
to overdraw and then we can position the
center<00:06:28.699> of<00:06:28.759> gravity<00:06:29.150> helper<00:06:29.569> into<00:06:30.529> a<00:06:30.560> position

00:06:30.999 --> 00:06:31.009 
center of gravity helper into a position

00:06:31.009 --> 00:06:32.800 
center of gravity helper into a position
which<00:06:31.430> makes<00:06:31.490> sense<00:06:32.029> for<00:06:32.240> the<00:06:32.360> aircraft

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:32.810 
which makes sense for the aircraft

00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:35.430 
which makes sense for the aircraft
usually<00:06:33.710> the<00:06:33.860> center<00:06:34.069> of<00:06:34.190> gravity<00:06:34.310> is<00:06:34.879> roughly

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:35.440 
usually the center of gravity is roughly

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:38.649 
usually the center of gravity is roughly
25%<00:06:36.440> of<00:06:37.009> the<00:06:37.159> way<00:06:37.279> back<00:06:37.490> along<00:06:37.669> the<00:06:37.879> wing<00:06:38.060> so

00:06:38.649 --> 00:06:38.659 
25% of the way back along the wing so

00:06:38.659 --> 00:06:41.879 
25% of the way back along the wing so
about<00:06:38.870> here<00:06:39.139> and<00:06:39.889> roughly<00:06:40.729> in<00:06:40.849> line<00:06:40.879> with<00:06:41.449> the

00:06:41.879 --> 00:06:41.889 
about here and roughly in line with the

00:06:41.889 --> 00:06:43.029 
about here and roughly in line with the
engine

00:06:43.029 --> 00:06:43.039 
engine

00:06:43.039 --> 00:06:45.100 
engine
so<00:06:43.279> we'll<00:06:43.639> say<00:06:43.909> around<00:06:44.479> about<00:06:44.719> here<00:06:45.080> that

00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:45.110 
so we'll say around about here that

00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:52.059 
so we'll say around about here that
should<00:06:45.560> be<00:06:46.000> about<00:06:47.000> right<00:06:47.060> for<00:06:47.419> now<00:06:50.860> and<00:06:51.860> if<00:06:52.009> we

00:06:52.059 --> 00:06:52.069 
should be about right for now and if we

00:06:52.069 --> 00:06:54.369 
should be about right for now and if we
look<00:06:52.250> at<00:06:52.279> it<00:06:52.460> here<00:06:52.610> you<00:06:52.639> can<00:06:52.819> see<00:06:53.210> that<00:06:54.169> we<00:06:54.259> have

00:06:54.369 --> 00:06:54.379 
look at it here you can see that we have

00:06:54.379 --> 00:06:57.279 
look at it here you can see that we have
a<00:06:54.409> center<00:06:54.740> gravity<00:06:54.919> setup<00:06:55.370> and<00:06:55.879> the<00:06:56.479> aircraft

00:06:57.279 --> 00:06:57.289 
a center gravity setup and the aircraft

00:06:57.289 --> 00:06:59.320 
a center gravity setup and the aircraft
is<00:06:57.529> now<00:06:57.560> the<00:06:58.159> model<00:06:58.400> is<00:06:58.490> now<00:06:58.669> attached<00:06:58.939> to<00:06:58.969> our

00:06:59.320 --> 00:06:59.330 
is now the model is now attached to our

00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:01.749 
is now the model is now attached to our
aircraft<00:06:59.810> we've<00:06:59.990> now<00:07:00.889> done<00:07:01.039> that<00:07:01.310> we<00:07:01.490> can

00:07:01.749 --> 00:07:01.759 
aircraft we've now done that we can

00:07:01.759 --> 00:07:06.009 
aircraft we've now done that we can
start<00:07:02.210> to<00:07:02.360> look<00:07:02.509> at<00:07:02.810> how<00:07:02.839> to<00:07:03.139> attach<00:07:03.680> wings
