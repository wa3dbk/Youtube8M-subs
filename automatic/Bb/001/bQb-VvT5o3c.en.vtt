camera<00:00:27.030> right<00:00:27.360> here<00:00:27.980> I've<00:00:28.980> been<00:00:29.280> using<00:00:29.610> Canon

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
camera right here I've been using Canon

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.689 
camera right here I've been using Canon
H<00:00:30.390> DSLR<00:00:31.140> cameras<00:00:31.590> for<00:00:31.800> the<00:00:31.949> majority<00:00:32.250> of<00:00:32.460> my

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:32.699 
H DSLR cameras for the majority of my

00:00:32.699 --> 00:00:34.340 
H DSLR cameras for the majority of my
footage<00:00:33.090> that<00:00:33.239> I'm<00:00:33.360> filming<00:00:33.690> in<00:00:33.930> fact<00:00:34.199> I'm

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
footage that I'm filming in fact I'm

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.069 
footage that I'm filming in fact I'm
using<00:00:34.500> a<00:00:34.620> Canon<00:00:34.890> 7d<00:00:35.309> right<00:00:35.609> now<00:00:35.850> but<00:00:36.629> I<00:00:36.659> needed

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
using a Canon 7d right now but I needed

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:38.930 
using a Canon 7d right now but I needed
something<00:00:37.289> that<00:00:37.469> would<00:00:37.679> record<00:00:38.100> longer<00:00:38.670> for

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
something that would record longer for

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.180 
something that would record longer for
event<00:00:39.239> style<00:00:39.749> shooting<00:00:40.230> so<00:00:40.739> something<00:00:41.159> that

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
event style shooting so something that

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.130 
event style shooting so something that
would<00:00:41.399> record<00:00:41.850> over<00:00:42.300> an<00:00:42.420> hour<00:00:42.629> straight

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
would record over an hour straight

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.559 
would record over an hour straight
without<00:00:43.499> stopping<00:00:44.010> and<00:00:44.699> starting<00:00:44.940> every<00:00:45.300> 12

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:45.569 
without stopping and starting every 12

00:00:45.569 --> 00:00:48.669 
without stopping and starting every 12
minutes<00:00:45.780> so<00:00:46.469> I<00:00:46.530> use<00:00:46.979> this<00:00:47.190> primarily<00:00:47.519> as<00:00:48.030> my

00:00:48.669 --> 00:00:48.679 
minutes so I use this primarily as my

00:00:48.679 --> 00:00:52.309 
minutes so I use this primarily as my
master<00:00:49.679> shot<00:00:50.249> for<00:00:50.729> events<00:00:51.239> and<00:00:51.389> I<00:00:52.050> go<00:00:52.229> around

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:52.319 
master shot for events and I go around

00:00:52.319 --> 00:00:54.469 
master shot for events and I go around
with<00:00:52.589> the<00:00:52.679> Canon<00:00:52.979> 7d<00:00:53.309> and<00:00:53.550> a<00:00:53.609> t2i<00:00:53.969> on<00:00:54.269> both

00:00:54.469 --> 00:00:54.479 
with the Canon 7d and a t2i on both

00:00:54.479 --> 00:00:56.930 
with the Canon 7d and a t2i on both
sides<00:00:54.809> works<00:00:55.620> out<00:00:55.799> really<00:00:56.129> nicely<00:00:56.399> a<00:00:56.639> three

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
sides works out really nicely a three

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.819 
sides works out really nicely a three
camera<00:00:57.239> shoot<00:00:57.510> for<00:00:57.780> an<00:00:57.839> event<00:01:00.469> one<00:01:01.469> thing<00:01:01.709> I

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
camera shoot for an event one thing I

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.770 
camera shoot for an event one thing I
like<00:01:02.100> about<00:01:02.129> this<00:01:02.489> camera<00:01:02.760> is<00:01:03.089> it<00:01:03.299> has<00:01:03.449> a

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
like about this camera is it has a

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.719 
like about this camera is it has a
tracking<00:01:04.229> where<00:01:04.949> you<00:01:05.070> can<00:01:05.220> touch<00:01:05.489> the<00:01:05.700> screen

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
tracking where you can touch the screen

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.179 
tracking where you can touch the screen
and<00:01:06.360> it<00:01:06.450> tracks<00:01:06.780> someone's<00:01:07.140> face<00:01:07.409> it<00:01:07.770> also<00:01:07.950> has

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
and it tracks someone's face it also has

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:12.999 
and it tracks someone's face it also has
zebra<00:01:08.670> stripes<00:01:09.060> it<00:01:09.360> has<00:01:09.799> two<00:01:10.909> SD<00:01:11.909> card<00:01:12.570> slots

00:01:12.999 --> 00:01:13.009 
zebra stripes it has two SD card slots

00:01:13.009 --> 00:01:16.910 
zebra stripes it has two SD card slots
which<00:01:14.009> I<00:01:14.189> have<00:01:14.369> two<00:01:14.850> 32<00:01:15.390> gig<00:01:15.630> cards<00:01:15.990> in<00:01:16.110> here<00:01:16.289> so

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
which I have two 32 gig cards in here so

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.880 
which I have two 32 gig cards in here so
total<00:01:17.280> of<00:01:17.369> 64<00:01:17.880> gigs<00:01:18.210> which<00:01:18.450> is<00:01:18.659> a<00:01:18.840> lot<00:01:19.289> that's

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
total of 64 gigs which is a lot that's

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.410 
total of 64 gigs which is a lot that's
the<00:01:20.039> highest<00:01:20.250> setting<00:01:20.759> I<00:01:20.969> think<00:01:21.000> you<00:01:21.299> can

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
the highest setting I think you can

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.090 
the highest setting I think you can
record<00:01:21.719> for<00:01:21.990> 8<00:01:22.140> hours<00:01:22.320> straight

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
record for 8 hours straight

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.310 
record for 8 hours straight
it's<00:01:23.490> really<00:01:23.759> great<00:01:24.090> the<00:01:24.630> thing<00:01:24.810> I<00:01:24.930> don't<00:01:24.990> like

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
it's really great the thing I don't like

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:26.779 
it's really great the thing I don't like
though<00:01:25.649> is<00:01:25.770> when<00:01:25.890> you<00:01:25.979> take<00:01:26.189> these<00:01:26.340> out<00:01:26.549> and

00:01:26.779 --> 00:01:26.789 
though is when you take these out and

00:01:26.789 --> 00:01:28.940 
though is when you take these out and
put<00:01:26.880> them<00:01:27.210> in<00:01:27.329> the<00:01:27.450> computer<00:01:27.630> you<00:01:28.170> have<00:01:28.770> to

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
put them in the computer you have to

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.060 
put them in the computer you have to
drag<00:01:29.250> the<00:01:29.490> entire<00:01:29.630> card<00:01:30.630> over<00:01:31.109> and<00:01:31.350> then<00:01:31.920> you

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
drag the entire card over and then you

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.399 
drag the entire card over and then you
have<00:01:32.219> to<00:01:32.369> use<00:01:32.490> Final<00:01:32.880> Cut<00:01:32.909> Pro<00:01:33.060> to<00:01:33.689> convert<00:01:34.259> the

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
have to use Final Cut Pro to convert the

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.859 
have to use Final Cut Pro to convert the
footage<00:01:34.710> to<00:01:34.950> pro<00:01:35.549> res<00:01:35.579> whatever<00:01:36.149> you<00:01:36.450> add<00:01:36.689> it

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
footage to pro res whatever you add it

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.410 
footage to pro res whatever you add it
with<00:01:37.020> so<00:01:37.679> just<00:01:38.039> like<00:01:38.189> the<00:01:38.280> Canon<00:01:38.579> 7d<00:01:38.880> footage<00:01:39.329> I

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
with so just like the Canon 7d footage I

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.080 
with so just like the Canon 7d footage I
convert<00:01:39.719> everything<00:01:40.020> to<00:01:40.289> pro<00:01:40.560> res<00:01:40.939> that<00:01:41.939> has<00:01:42.060> a

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
convert everything to pro res that has a

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.399 
convert everything to pro res that has a
great<00:01:42.450> stabilization<00:01:43.320> feature<00:01:43.500> as<00:01:43.979> well<00:01:45.409> you

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
great stabilization feature as well you

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.319 
great stabilization feature as well you
just<00:01:46.619> go<00:01:46.740> into<00:01:46.920> the<00:01:47.070> menu<00:01:47.369> here<00:01:47.549> and<00:01:47.789> turn<00:01:47.999> on<00:01:48.090> a

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
just go into the menu here and turn on a

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.840 
just go into the menu here and turn on a
stabilization<00:01:48.869> feature<00:01:49.409> that<00:01:49.770> it's<00:01:50.009> there's

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
stabilization feature that it's there's

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.849 
stabilization feature that it's there's
two<00:01:51.210> different<00:01:51.630> ones<00:01:51.749> actually<00:01:52.380> I<00:01:52.409> believe

00:01:52.849 --> 00:01:52.859 
two different ones actually I believe

00:01:52.859 --> 00:01:56.389 
two different ones actually I believe
the<00:01:53.159> first<00:01:53.520> one<00:01:53.820> is<00:01:54.119> dynamic<00:01:55.049> and<00:01:55.649> the<00:01:56.100> second

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
the first one is dynamic and the second

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.639 
the first one is dynamic and the second
one<00:01:56.520> is<00:01:56.640> standard<00:01:57.060> dynamic<00:01:57.990> you<00:01:58.109> can<00:01:58.140> really

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
one is standard dynamic you can really

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:02.419 
one is standard dynamic you can really
use<00:01:58.859> when<00:01:59.219> you<00:01:59.509> hold<00:02:00.509> it<00:02:00.719> and<00:02:00.929> then<00:02:01.170> zoom<00:02:02.009> it

00:02:02.419 --> 00:02:02.429 
use when you hold it and then zoom it

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:05.209 
use when you hold it and then zoom it
really<00:02:03.270> produces<00:02:04.049> smooth<00:02:04.350> results

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
really produces smooth results

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:08.889 
really produces smooth results
it's<00:02:05.429> a<00:02:05.549> CMOS<00:02:06.119> chip<00:02:06.569> HD<00:02:07.170> but

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:08.899 
it's a CMOS chip HD but

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:12.220 
it's a CMOS chip HD but
I<00:02:09.310> haven't<00:02:10.310> really<00:02:10.519> noticed<00:02:10.700> too<00:02:11.239> much<00:02:11.510> of<00:02:11.750> the

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.230 
I haven't really noticed too much of the

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:14.740
