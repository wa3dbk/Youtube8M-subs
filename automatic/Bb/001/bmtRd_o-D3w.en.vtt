00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:01.960 
and we're going to look at a simple

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:04.920 
and we're going to look at a simple
pattern<00:02:02.230> here<00:02:02.800> it's<00:02:03.010> a<00:02:03.850> kind<00:02:04.660> of<00:02:04.750> like<00:02:04.900> a

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:04.930 
pattern here it's a kind of like a

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:08.520 
pattern here it's a kind of like a
montuno<00:02:05.560> pattern<00:02:06.840> and<00:02:07.840> the<00:02:07.930> Mon<00:02:08.080> Tue<00:02:08.290> nose

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:08.530 
montuno pattern and the Mon Tue nose

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:10.230 
montuno pattern and the Mon Tue nose
were<00:02:08.800> played<00:02:09.100> originally<00:02:09.610> by<00:02:09.729> an<00:02:09.850> instrument

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:10.240 
were played originally by an instrument

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:13.260 
were played originally by an instrument
called<00:02:10.360> a<00:02:10.510> trace<00:02:10.810> which<00:02:11.620> is<00:02:11.650> a<00:02:12.090> small<00:02:13.090> guitar

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.270 
called a trace which is a small guitar

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:15.810 
called a trace which is a small guitar
instrument<00:02:13.990> has<00:02:14.200> just<00:02:14.860> three<00:02:15.130> strings<00:02:15.550> each

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:15.820 
instrument has just three strings each

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:18.750 
instrument has just three strings each
string<00:02:16.240> is<00:02:16.360> a<00:02:16.390> double<00:02:16.810> string<00:02:17.550> kind<00:02:18.550> of<00:02:18.610> like<00:02:18.700> a

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 
string is a double string kind of like a

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:21.920 
string is a double string kind of like a
12<00:02:19.000> string<00:02:19.210> guitar<00:02:19.300> but<00:02:19.900> only<00:02:20.340> three<00:02:21.340> strings

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
12 string guitar but only three strings

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.120 
12 string guitar but only three strings
so<00:02:22.930> you<00:02:22.960> can<00:02:23.170> think<00:02:23.320> of<00:02:23.380> it<00:02:23.500> as<00:02:23.530> a<00:02:23.650> six<00:02:23.950> string

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:24.130 
so you can think of it as a six string

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:26.310 
so you can think of it as a six string
guitar<00:02:24.520> but<00:02:24.880> really<00:02:25.660> it's<00:02:25.780> called<00:02:25.900> the<00:02:26.050> trace

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:26.320 
guitar but really it's called the trace

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:27.990 
guitar but really it's called the trace
because<00:02:26.500> each<00:02:26.830> string<00:02:27.160> is<00:02:27.280> an<00:02:27.370> octave<00:02:27.760> an

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.000 
because each string is an octave an

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.810 
because each string is an octave an
octave<00:02:28.690> higher<00:02:28.900> and<00:02:29.400> they<00:02:30.400> would<00:02:30.520> play<00:02:30.610> these

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:30.820 
octave higher and they would play these

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:33.360 
octave higher and they would play these
patterns<00:02:31.270> later<00:02:32.170> on<00:02:32.380> when<00:02:32.650> the<00:02:32.770> piano<00:02:32.980> came

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
patterns later on when the piano came

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:35.400 
patterns later on when the piano came
into<00:02:33.580> this<00:02:33.790> music<00:02:34.150> the<00:02:34.810> piano<00:02:35.080> started

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:35.410 
into this music the piano started

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:37.260 
into this music the piano started
playing<00:02:35.620> the<00:02:35.680> Montu<00:02:36.010> nose<00:02:36.220> and<00:02:36.580> now<00:02:36.730> in<00:02:37.060> modern

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:37.270 
playing the Montu nose and now in modern

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:39.240 
playing the Montu nose and now in modern
times<00:02:37.720> the<00:02:37.930> guitar<00:02:38.350> players<00:02:38.620> are<00:02:38.920> again

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250 
times the guitar players are again

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:41.220 
times the guitar players are again
imitating<00:02:40.060> the<00:02:40.300> Montu<00:02:40.600> knows<00:02:40.840> that<00:02:41.110> the

imitating the Montu knows that the
tricks<00:02:44.980> originally<00:02:45.490> played<00:02:45.730> so<00:02:46.030> it's<00:02:46.209> a<00:02:46.330> giant

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:46.630 
tricks originally played so it's a giant

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:50.370 
tricks originally played so it's a giant
cycle<00:02:47.260> of<00:02:47.680> some<00:02:47.950> weird<00:02:48.310> sort<00:02:48.610> and<00:02:49.260> we're<00:02:50.260> going

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:50.380 
cycle of some weird sort and we're going

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:52.380 
cycle of some weird sort and we're going
to<00:02:50.440> do<00:02:50.500> a<00:02:50.560> little<00:02:50.680> pattern<00:02:51.070> today<00:02:51.239> and<00:02:52.239> it's

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:52.390 
to do a little pattern today and it's

00:03:31.259 --> 00:03:31.269 
measures long my metronome is clicking

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:38.460 
measures long my metronome is clicking
away<00:03:31.769> at<00:03:32.769> half<00:03:33.190> notes<00:03:33.459> 1<00:03:34.150> 2<00:03:34.630> 3<00:03:35.200> 4<00:03:35.769> 1<00:03:36.280> 2<00:03:36.610> 3<00:03:37.209> 4<00:03:37.810> so

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:38.470 
away at half notes 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 so

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:40.050 
away at half notes 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 so
here<00:03:38.500> would<00:03:38.739> be<00:03:38.800> the<00:03:38.950> body<00:03:39.220> this<00:03:39.519> is<00:03:39.550> really

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:40.060 
here would be the body this is really

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:48.170 
here would be the body this is really
slow<00:03:40.360> one

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:48.180 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:51.060 

okay<00:03:49.180> so<00:03:49.750> that's<00:03:49.930> probably<00:03:50.440> the<00:03:50.650> slowest

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:51.070 
okay so that's probably the slowest

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:53.580 
okay so that's probably the slowest
cloudy<00:03:51.340> you're<00:03:51.580> ever<00:03:51.700> going<00:03:51.790> to<00:03:51.850> hear<00:03:52.090> and<00:03:52.590> I'm

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:53.590 
cloudy you're ever going to hear and I'm

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:55.260 
cloudy you're ever going to hear and I'm
going<00:03:53.800> to<00:03:53.860> play<00:03:54.070> the<00:03:54.340> progression<00:03:55.000> for<00:03:55.210> you

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:55.270 
going to play the progression for you

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:56.940 
going to play the progression for you
slow<00:03:55.540> then<00:03:55.810> I'll<00:03:55.930> play<00:03:56.110> that<00:03:56.260> a<00:03:56.290> more<00:03:56.530> regular

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:56.950 
slow then I'll play that a more regular

00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:59.010 
slow then I'll play that a more regular
tempo<00:03:57.340> so<00:03:57.850> let's<00:03:58.120> see<00:03:58.240> if<00:03:58.300> I<00:03:58.360> can<00:03:58.510> even<00:03:58.540> do<00:03:58.810> this

00:03:59.010 --> 00:03:59.020 
tempo so let's see if I can even do this

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:19.770 
tempo so let's see if I can even do this
one<00:03:59.440> two<00:04:00.430> one<00:04:01.420> two<00:04:01.690> three<00:04:02.140> four<00:04:18.239> so<00:04:19.239> there<00:04:19.540> was

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:19.780 
one two one two three four so there was

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:21.570 
one two one two three four so there was
I'm<00:04:20.020> surprised<00:04:20.650> I<00:04:20.770> was<00:04:20.890> able<00:04:20.980> to<00:04:21.130> do<00:04:21.280> that<00:04:21.400> that

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:21.580 
I'm surprised I was able to do that that

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:22.860 
I'm surprised I was able to do that that
slow<00:04:21.820> but<00:04:22.090> that<00:04:22.390> was<00:04:22.480> cool

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:22.870 
slow but that was cool

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:25.710 
slow but that was cool
and<00:04:23.310> using<00:04:24.310> the<00:04:24.400> little<00:04:24.550> tiny<00:04:24.760> chords<00:04:25.210> a<00:04:25.390> minor

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:25.720 
and using the little tiny chords a minor

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:28.860 
and using the little tiny chords a minor
so<00:04:26.650> I<00:04:26.680> can<00:04:26.890> a<00:04:27.040> minor<00:04:27.250> six<00:04:27.640> you<00:04:28.570> could<00:04:28.720> also

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:28.870 
so I can a minor six you could also

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:34.050 
so I can a minor six you could also
think<00:04:29.170> of<00:04:29.320> this<00:04:29.560> as<00:04:29.860> your<00:04:29.920> d9<00:04:32.460> then<00:04:33.460> a<00:04:33.820> major

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:34.060 
think of this as your d9 then a major

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:40.050 
think of this as your d9 then a major
seven<00:04:34.600> to<00:04:35.530> a<00:04:36.000> G<00:04:37.000> major<00:04:37.210> 7<00:04:37.450> sorry<00:04:37.810> -<00:04:38.740> uh<00:04:38.880> the<00:04:39.880> G

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:40.060 
seven to a G major 7 sorry - uh the G

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:40.620 
seven to a G major 7 sorry - uh the G
major

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:40.630 
major

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:50.360 
major
six<00:04:40.900> nine<00:04:41.140> B<00:04:41.860> minor<00:04:42.100> seven<00:04:42.550> five<00:04:42.790> five<00:04:43.740> ISA

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:50.370 

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:52.410 

and<00:04:51.370> again<00:04:51.610> I'm<00:04:51.730> always<00:04:51.850> trying<00:04:52.030> to<00:04:52.120> do<00:04:52.270> this

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:52.420 
and again I'm always trying to do this

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:55.260 
and again I'm always trying to do this
nice<00:04:52.630> voice<00:04:53.020> leading<00:04:53.290> stuff<00:04:54.280> where<00:04:55.090> I'm

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:55.270 
nice voice leading stuff where I'm

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:57.630 
nice voice leading stuff where I'm
connecting<00:04:55.690> my<00:04:55.780> cores<00:04:56.080> bi-polar<00:04:56.890> half-step

00:04:57.630 --> 00:04:57.640 
connecting my cores bi-polar half-step

00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:00.360 
connecting my cores bi-polar half-step
when<00:04:57.910> possible<00:04:58.440> now<00:04:59.440> let's<00:04:59.740> try<00:04:59.890> this<00:05:00.040> up<00:05:00.160> to<00:05:00.340> a

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:00.370 
when possible now let's try this up to a

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:05.010 
when possible now let's try this up to a
more<00:05:01.270> danceable<00:05:01.750> tempo<00:05:03.000> so<00:05:04.000> now<00:05:04.180> my<00:05:04.450> half<00:05:04.750> note

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:05.020 
more danceable tempo so now my half note

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:15.180 
more danceable tempo so now my half note
is<00:05:05.320> at<00:05:05.860> 90<00:05:06.280> ok<00:05:08.610> so<00:05:09.610> again<00:05:10.030> the<00:05:13.650> the<00:05:14.650> car<00:05:14.860> would

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:15.190 
is at 90 ok so again the the car would

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:50.210 
is at 90 ok so again the the car would
be<00:05:19.080> makes<00:05:20.080> more<00:05:20.200> sense<00:05:20.500> now<00:05:48.630> there<00:05:49.630> it<00:05:49.750> is<00:05:49.870> and

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:50.220 
be makes more sense now there it is and
