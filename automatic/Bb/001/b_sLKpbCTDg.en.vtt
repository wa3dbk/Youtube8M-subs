00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
imaginations run wild as to how I

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.190 
imaginations run wild as to how I
managed<00:01:32.219> to<00:01:32.310> do<00:01:32.549> many<00:01:32.939> more<00:01:33.210> when<00:01:33.689> the<00:01:33.810> camera

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200

00:03:59.020 --> 00:03:59.030 
point of view I just like using a bit of

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:00.580 
point of view I just like using a bit of
lemon<00:03:59.420> juice<00:03:59.450> I<00:03:59.840> think<00:03:59.870> it's<00:04:00.140> quite<00:04:00.290> natural

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:00.590

and<00:04:01.160> I<00:04:01.850> just<00:04:02.150> don't<00:04:02.330> agree<00:04:03.110> with<00:04:03.560> sugar<00:04:03.890> on

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:04.160

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:06.140 
fruit but you know that's only my

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:09.310 
fruit but you know that's only my
opinion<00:04:06.520> but<00:04:07.520> there<00:04:08.090> you<00:04:08.180> have<00:04:08.390> a<00:04:08.690> tropical

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:09.320
