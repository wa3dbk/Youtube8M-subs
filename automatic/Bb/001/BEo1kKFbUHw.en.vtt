00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:08.090
 I believe we have all seen the play 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:10.710
 we cannot in the clear offside vol 

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:14.309
 hiding it was so obvious that it is 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:17.520
 was a very important mistake 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:19.910
 but now we must concentrate on 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:23.760
 next game and think a little 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:25.350
 the importance of doing it well and going to 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:29.580
 win like we did with volumes 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:33.180
 after the percentage just say that 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:34.890
 we have always done well away from home there 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.989
 let's try another time 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.660
 I trust we can do it I believe that 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:41.430
 them a tough team though 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.540
 we have created opportunities we can 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.730
 to do it 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.550
 talking about my future yet have 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.170
 talked to my attorney 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:50.219
 what happened I greeted and 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.280
 that's enough 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:55.699
 he saw me register what is 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:59.070
 arrived the president we are there for 

00:00:55.699 --> 00:01:00.390
 listen to the proposal afterwards 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.910
 with him talking to my family 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:06.180
 decide 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:08.100
 clearly sorry to see the 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.770
 team create so much the second 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.570
 time and do not score but many times it is 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:16.080
 happened this year that the goalkeeper 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:19.380
 stronger player than the other team e 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:23.009
 this I'm sorry because it means that 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:25.320
 but the team also creates that one is missing 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:27.840
 a bit of concreteness a bit of precision 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.759
 clearly I talk about soccer ho 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:33.090
 talked about what happened during 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:35.729
 the game and I think the accident 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.079
 had the statutes prepared the 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.640
 next game what I have to 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:41.460
 do 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:44.040
 no it's the mistake it was all communist 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:46.500
 now I repeat my experience tells me 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:48.690
 that we must concentrate in the next 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.760
 but that will be the parma however after the 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:53.880
 return match because we ca n't 

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:55.380
 change things we have to think a little 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.940
 what the team did 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.010
 especially according to the time it has 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:01.500
 proved he can do wants to try it 

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:04.380
 try to do it dinner with him if I have it 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:06.630
 talked told me they talked 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:09.179
 who listened to the president tomorrow 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:11.700
 I will talk and then decide these days 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:13.560
 but I don't know exactly how many 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:16.140
 days not sure of the good job that 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:21.600
 they also did a job that he has 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:24.660
 done what the line proved maybe 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:28.040
 but I think the team was creating 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:30.209
 he was doing well and when he did 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:32.100
 overbalance 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:35.040
 meanwhile it is wanted thinking that for the 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:38.760
 well it can be negative i think but 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:42.209
 it was not near where in the area where 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:43.920
 however, it must have been 1 to 0 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:49.220
 the team was still a good result 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:51.150
 it created a wait because we know him 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:54.090
 player that attacks more depth 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:56.610
 of our team and that was it 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:03:00.269
 but if you were looking for it then you are a little earlier 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:02.250
 or then it may have been the time 

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:03.860
 we just don't know in the end I think 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:06.440
 who wants them to do it 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:08.370
 lets do this a bit and these 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:10.350
 analysis 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:12.989
 depends on many things not only of the 

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:16.170
 quality and technical quality 

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:18.540
 I say many times that he is not alone 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:20.750
 quality quality for me to know what 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:22.829
 that you have to do every time anyway 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:24.209
 show character do the stage 

00:03:22.829 --> 00:03:26.819
 defensive well that all these things 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:29.189
 but with all this 

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:31.310
 we put it together I believe that yes 

00:03:29.189 --> 00:03:34.290
 we have shown that we are a team 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:34.829
 strong that they are a tough team and 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:38.189
 hard 

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:40.290
 we saw it however as we did 

00:03:38.189 --> 00:03:43.469
 against how we did against the 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:45.569
 fly dynamo the team created so much 

00:03:43.469 --> 00:03:47.159
 against the wheels we scored against 

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:48.840
 the no show however we have created so much 

00:03:47.159 --> 00:03:54.180
 that I trust you can do the same 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:56.519
 not to say a percentage I think like 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:58.859
 I said before that I trust why 

00:03:56.519 --> 00:04:00.810
 saw the team to do it well many 

00:03:58.859 --> 00:04:04.230
 times I think we can do it too 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:06.209
 to whom trust is one hundred percent that 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:10.049
 we can do it that will be difficult too 

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:12.000
 sure though i trust after i don't talk 

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:13.879
 I normally think that the referees today 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:18.030
 the episode was clear though 

00:04:13.879 --> 00:04:19.289
 I prefer as I said no don't say 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:21.229
 nothing because we have to think about 

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:23.310
 next game and not find it now 

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:25.889
 no alibi because nothing changes 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:28.110
 as I said before I am not yet 

00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:30.720
 I heard my attorney to find out 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:32.560
 what the president's proposal is after 

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:35.500
 this 

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:40.060
 but we decide now it's too much now 

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:42.160
 soon yes clearly then change one 

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:44.560
 all the approach the game that 

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:46.300
 they must make them do it and we must 

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:48.910
 doing the same for us is the same we must 

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:52.270
 go win like I did today for 

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:55.060
 them then the board they think they make one 

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:57.700
 match as they did today can 

00:04:55.060 --> 00:05:01.570
 be sufficient because a draw a 

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:02.410
 0 and it's fine for them but I repeat that it is 

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:04.960
 a risk 

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:07.600
 I believe they will try to score goals 

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:09.700
 and to get in trouble and we must 

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:10.710
 make a similar game try 

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:14.400
 win enough 

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:14.400
 thank you thank you all
