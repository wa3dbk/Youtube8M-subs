 recto players point it 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:15.540
 this week we show you the 10 weapons 

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:17.429
 more bizarre as the kakà type shoots it 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.710
 may because there is no card shoot 

00:00:17.429 --> 00:00:21.259
 peace would surely shoot her 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.689
 calculation would be a bizarre weapon 

00:00:21.259 --> 00:00:26.429
 I certainly don't know about that 

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:29.130
 it could be like they couldn't 

00:00:26.429 --> 00:00:32.369
 disappear as the abbreviation is long but 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:36.720
 study three falaqa monkeys number 10 to 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:39.050
 ten we have the gap is co2 lancer 

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:41.130

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.150

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:54.620
 shoot but then to the last shot of the 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:57.240
 type charger you can raise and 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:01:01.080
 from the type checks against the walls the 

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:02.700
 what i 'm fucking but he had kids 

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:04.649
 to stand there because they said life begins 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:07.499
 then what the fuck actually actually 

00:01:04.649 --> 00:01:10.020

00:01:07.499 --> 00:01:14.939

 we could not put it was too mine 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:32.840
 as he travels he pulsates and serves 

00:01:29.819 --> 00:01:35.219
 really to solve certain puzzles of 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:38.960
 power because you explore anyway 

00:01:35.219 --> 00:01:43.170
 explore it rare and destroy which 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:45.990
 life farts it to the region 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:48.389
 we have the Fallout 3 rolling pin 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:55.619

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:12.119
 rolling pin 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:18.040
 paradoxically it is more a mad decorum but 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:19.990
 paradoxically used the bullets of 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:22.810

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:25.600

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:45.880

 practically a star but very powerful 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:21.670
 with one blow you kill enemies 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:25.870
