00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.400
 hello I will today to the learning tips 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:07.670
 directx cult series and had 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:10.110
 I prepared a few for you and 

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:13.440
 That 's how it goes for the preparation until the 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:15.179
 learn and yes so I do it now 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.520
 has the right to explain 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:18.990
 and I wish you a lot of fun 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.970
 Tip number one for a good one 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.039
 Preparation is everything 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.470
 always write in the planner and stuff 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:27.599
 I'm still times as a small of 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.750
 me myself and write there 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:32.219
 I just keep on reading his book 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.690
 any page the topics the 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:35.579
 so you can also yours 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.870
 For example, teachers do that 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.340
 always so if our teachers do not 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.140
 Say what you need for work 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.329
 then they say for example certain topics 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.520
 or certain book pages and then 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.230
 I write to you me you me 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.329
 and then I write that to me too 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.910
 small cards with index cards 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:52.739
 can you learn so much better so me 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.760
 just make it easier to think of a lot more 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.230
 much less time 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.850
 you can you still again 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.890
 plug in and keep learning and 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:03.120
 that's just a lot more practical than that 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:04.799
 a huge piece of paper and I have countries 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.630
 mostly the things by heart so that 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:08.520
 I always keep small cards 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.260
 design really do not be too long 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.790
 In addition, I also learn already 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.810
 until two weeks before I look 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.670
 that's all on the cards 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.080
 and then we always just take it 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.000
 everywhere with me and let the ever 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.590
 again, that's a lot of it 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.030
 easier to finish and you have me 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.460
 all this stress at once 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.590
 and that's why I always do that 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.150
 some weeks before I look at the 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.650
 also that I have to learn and then catch 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.970
 I still have time to learn 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.100
 if I did not understand something 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:34.200
 to go to the teacher or are just too 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.689
 ask this is a good guy too 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:39.030
 it really helps and it is always bad 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:41.270
 to learn one day before but if 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:44.909
 no other way or just you 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:46.439
 then just learn anyway I am too 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:48.180
 on so human because there does not say 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:49.200
 do not stop and distribute the work but 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.280
 that was really a bad one 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.659
 attitude from me and that is always 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:55.619
 better to learn for work 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:57.329
 and yes therefore took time with me 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:00.240
 even a diva to close to just 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:01.710
 but it starts getting better 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.259
 far ahead yet to learn or 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.890
 just after the lesson 

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:07.750
 to write cards and 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:09.190
 It is also always good to teach 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:10.780
 to write down the cards and the 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:12.610
 teaching material then at home yet 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:14.830
 possible to live in really good tips 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:17.470
 which always help me great 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:20.380
 Tip number two is definitely mobile 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:22.810
 laptop tv everything that distracts 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:24.730
 could go away i know when you learn 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:26.410
 Everything is more interesting than that 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:28.080
 real learning but you can be 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:29.500
 when learning just so fast 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:34.120
 distract 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:34.989
 that's just better the side sets 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:36.580
 to organize his thoughts 

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:38.050
 I 'm just going to miss a lot 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:40.239
 just at the side or go away 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:43.570
 or shut it up or throw it 

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:45.370
 throws away directly but main thing goes 

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:48.070
 not at the mobile phone with that is always something 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:50.230
 do you get that out of the learning process and 

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:51.450
 let's go on endlessly long 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:55.570
 that's just better 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:59.140
 Tip number three is not doing any 

00:02:55.570 --> 00:03:02.820
 snacks and the many vitamins tap to 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:05.350
 for example, fruit salad or carrots or 

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:08.709
 orange juice freshly squeezed fresh 

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:10.299
 fruit or vegetables as well as vegetables only 

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:11.799
 plates of small hosek a big one 

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:13.540
 Just spend a little time with that 

00:03:11.799 --> 00:03:16.510
 vitamin A contributes to the right with contamination 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:19.030
 Firstly, good and that is with 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:20.739
 sweets and they help too 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:22.450
 learn to donate vitamins you have 

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:25.600
 then new energy and then you go to 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:26.950
 Example, you somehow sweet you have 

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:28.239
 it is not so much that I about you 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:30.549
 recommend while learning easy 

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:31.959
 student food or something to eat 

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:35.380
 because it's just much much better 

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:36.940
 learning is and yes I know you tried 

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:38.230
 because sometimes that's even times 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:38.440
 Just tried the next time 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:40.390
 times 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:42.030
 and if the pope had to add it off 

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:44.829
 only strawberries or what do I know 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:47.260
 Tip number four shares the things 

00:03:44.829 --> 00:03:49.120
 set the times 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:50.500
 So for example you only once 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:52.690
 half an hour and then learns 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:53.920
 half an hour or an hour 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:57.549
 and again , it's the best hour 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:59.980
 always three hours a day to learn that 

00:03:57.549 --> 00:04:02.290
 is so then the head remembers 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:04.020
 Best if you have three hours 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:06.300
 country but not the piece but 

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:08.850
 small breaks do not break too long 

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:09.540
 between 10 to 15 minutes that's enough 

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:11.490
 completely 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:13.680
 in time you can then also briefly 

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:15.600
 cellphone but then puts it away again that 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:17.550
 is just so always break of all and 

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:20.670
 then you continue learning that 's really on 

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:22.440
 best and tip number five reward you 

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:24.900
 for example, with small things now 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:26.760
 not like 20 new t-shirts or something 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:28.500
 just so little things if you are with 

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:30.420
 the country finished or so is there 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:31.800
 I set myself goals, for example 

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:34.350
 My matte goal is that I'm at work 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:36.210
 12 want to write or something and then 

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:37.500
 if you have these you always have us 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:39.630
 eyes as usual and again and again 

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:41.700
 also writes that he did this goal 

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:43.380
 I had him incentive to 

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:44.880
 So learn to save yourselves goals 

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:46.920
 for that you if you then 

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:49.710
 good note writes that then you 

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:51.390
 that are the can buy or that and 

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:52.470
 Parents talk about it if you are there 

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:54.360
 something you can do for example 

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:56.100
 just somehow that you are new 

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:58.350
 book from my parents or can 

00:04:56.100 --> 00:05:02.940
 So nothing big, but maybe 

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:05.850
 just do not know any language if it 

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:07.290
 even a colleague is just for 

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:09.540
 then you can be happy if you have something 

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:11.100
 has to work because that is actually 

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:12.630
 always good if you can do that 

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:14.360
 has to learn something, or simply to 

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:16.350
 a good report that's good too because 

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:18.750
 actually, good records are always 

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:21.570
 important and it's more incentive though 

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:23.780
 mostly apartments things rich 

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:26.760
 So bar are a year of certification 

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:29.790
 I do not believe it's number 6 and 

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:31.410
 My last tip is the tabs 

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:33.120
 which you have for example if now for 

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:35.100
 math which cards have the shipyard 

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:36.270
 does not realize because you know math is 

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:38.610
 every year, every year 

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:39.840
 berlin still stop topics and that's why 

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:41.580
 you can just have a little one 

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:44.970
 make wallet where all the cards 

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:46.590
 for example math is in there like can 

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:48.780
 you also unsure the topics and then 

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:50.220
 you just have that again if you 

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:52.290
 again look what you are there 

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:54.060
 just to make it so far back here 

00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:55.890
 simply top up topics in school 

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:58.950
 and that's why it's always a good one 

00:05:55.890 --> 00:06:00.990
 has and I hope you have all the tips 

00:05:58.950 --> 00:06:03.030
 fallen and gave her the particular 

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:04.380
 learning tips sticking to you then 

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:06.510
 tell me that because I love it 

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:08.240
 always to have new tips and otherwise 

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:12.660
 i would like you one more day and 

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:13.139
 Have fun learning and I wanted 

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:16.050
 you have 

00:06:13.139 --> 00:06:18.270
 a few pools of the coache you have to 

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:24.710
 so not an important tip 

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:24.710
 I think everything is always necessary
