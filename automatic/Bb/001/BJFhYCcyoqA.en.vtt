00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
took full advantage of this Lobby and I

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.360 
took full advantage of this Lobby and I
was<00:00:56.969> actually<00:00:57.210> doing<00:00:57.570> really<00:00:57.719> bad<00:00:58.559> during

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
was actually doing really bad during

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.220 
was actually doing really bad during
this<00:00:59.460> Lobby<00:00:59.699> as<00:00:59.969> you'll<00:01:00.149> tell<00:01:00.390> my<00:01:00.570> accuracy<00:01:01.020> is

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
this Lobby as you'll tell my accuracy is

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.680 
this Lobby as you'll tell my accuracy is
completely<00:01:01.770> off<00:01:01.949> I'd<00:01:02.699> say<00:01:02.940> my<00:01:03.090> accuracy<00:01:03.480> was

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
completely off I'd say my accuracy was

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.719 
completely off I'd say my accuracy was
maybe<00:01:03.840> around<00:01:04.199> twelve<00:01:04.680> or<00:01:04.949> thirteen<00:01:04.979> percent

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
maybe around twelve or thirteen percent

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.859 
maybe around twelve or thirteen percent
range<00:01:05.970> well<00:01:06.810> where<00:01:07.380> my<00:01:07.860> um<00:01:08.390> normal<00:01:09.390> accuracy

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
range well where my um normal accuracy

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:11.890 
range well where my um normal accuracy
in<00:01:10.020> games<00:01:10.290> i'd<00:01:10.530> say<00:01:10.680> maybe<00:01:10.830> like<00:01:11.040> a<00:01:11.070> 17<00:01:11.580> 18

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:11.900 
in games i'd say maybe like a 17 18

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:14.990 
in games i'd say maybe like a 17 18
around<00:01:12.900> that<00:01:13.110> area<00:01:13.500> so<00:01:14.040> it's<00:01:14.250> fairly<00:01:14.460> decent

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
around that area so it's fairly decent

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.520 
around that area so it's fairly decent
but<00:01:15.210> in<00:01:15.330> this<00:01:15.450> game<00:01:15.509> it<00:01:15.840> was<00:01:15.900> like<00:01:16.020> my<00:01:16.140> second
