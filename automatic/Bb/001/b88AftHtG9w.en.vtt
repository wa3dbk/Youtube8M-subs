systems<00:00:07.640> provide<00:00:08.000> drinking<00:00:08.210> in<00:00:08.510> wastewater

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:08.840 
systems provide drinking in wastewater

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:10.869 
systems provide drinking in wastewater
for<00:00:09.230> about<00:00:09.440> 90%<00:00:09.860> of<00:00:10.309> Albertans

00:00:10.869 --> 00:00:10.879 
for about 90% of Albertans

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:13.090 
for about 90% of Albertans
we<00:00:11.629> have<00:00:11.840> very<00:00:12.020> high<00:00:12.110> standards<00:00:12.290> for<00:00:12.860> both

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:13.100 
we have very high standards for both

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:15.490 
we have very high standards for both
municipal<00:00:13.850> wastewater<00:00:14.330> release<00:00:14.869> as<00:00:15.170> well<00:00:15.199> as

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:15.500 
municipal wastewater release as well as

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:17.769 
municipal wastewater release as well as
drinking<00:00:16.010> water<00:00:16.070> and<00:00:16.850> so<00:00:17.150> it's<00:00:17.300> important

00:00:17.769 --> 00:00:17.779 
drinking water and so it's important

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:19.269 
drinking water and so it's important
that<00:00:17.810> we<00:00:17.990> have<00:00:18.110> a<00:00:18.170> conversation<00:00:18.440> with

00:00:19.269 --> 00:00:19.279 
that we have a conversation with

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:21.010 
that we have a conversation with
Albertans<00:00:19.789> to<00:00:19.970> ensure<00:00:20.240> that<00:00:20.449> we<00:00:20.600> have<00:00:20.810> the

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:21.020 
Albertans to ensure that we have the

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:23.650 
Albertans to ensure that we have the
best<00:00:21.590> standards<00:00:22.070> in<00:00:22.190> the<00:00:22.280> world<00:00:22.310> but<00:00:23.300> part<00:00:23.570> of

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:23.660 
best standards in the world but part of

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:26.920 
best standards in the world but part of
that<00:00:23.920> with<00:00:24.920> that<00:00:25.100> comes<00:00:25.460> a<00:00:25.730> cost<00:00:26.060> to<00:00:26.360> upgrading

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:26.930 
that with that comes a cost to upgrading

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:28.330 
that with that comes a cost to upgrading
and<00:00:27.050> so<00:00:27.140> we<00:00:27.260> want<00:00:27.440> to<00:00:27.500> make<00:00:27.650> sure<00:00:27.680> that<00:00:28.039> we<00:00:28.190> have

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:28.340 
and so we want to make sure that we have

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:31.000 
and so we want to make sure that we have
the<00:00:28.490> right<00:00:28.780> regulatory<00:00:29.780> system<00:00:30.410> in<00:00:30.530> place<00:00:30.770> and

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:31.010 
the right regulatory system in place and

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:32.740 
the right regulatory system in place and
that<00:00:31.130> we<00:00:31.340> have<00:00:31.520> the<00:00:31.610> right<00:00:31.760> infrastructure

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:32.750 
that we have the right infrastructure

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:34.360 
that we have the right infrastructure
investment<00:00:33.440> in<00:00:33.559> place<00:00:33.770> to<00:00:34.010> make<00:00:34.160> sure<00:00:34.190> that

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:34.370 
investment in place to make sure that

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:37.510 
investment in place to make sure that
water<00:00:35.120> and<00:00:35.930> drinking<00:00:36.410> water<00:00:36.440> is<00:00:36.890> kept<00:00:37.280> safe

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:47.000 

we<00:00:44.370> have<00:00:44.640> a<00:00:44.670> very<00:00:45.240> robust<00:00:45.690> system<00:00:45.720> in<00:00:46.560> drinking

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
we have a very robust system in drinking

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.370 
we have a very robust system in drinking
water<00:00:47.070> and<00:00:47.430> wastewater<00:00:47.550> facilities<00:00:48.540> but<00:00:49.290> as

our province continues to grow and

our province continues to grow and
change<00:00:51.480> we<00:00:51.930> need<00:00:52.080> to<00:00:52.230> make<00:00:52.380> sure<00:00:52.410> that<00:00:52.800> we

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
change we need to make sure that we

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.250 
change we need to make sure that we
maintain<00:00:53.130> that<00:00:53.400> quality<00:00:54.270> of<00:00:54.630> drinking<00:00:54.870> water

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
maintain that quality of drinking water

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.710 
maintain that quality of drinking water
for<00:00:55.410> albertans<00:00:56.070> into<00:00:56.310> the<00:00:56.400> future<00:00:56.790> so<00:00:57.420> we<00:00:57.450> may

00:00:57.710 --> 00:00:57.720 
for albertans into the future so we may

00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:59.240 
for albertans into the future so we may
need<00:00:57.870> to<00:00:57.930> consider<00:00:58.500> new<00:00:58.740> and<00:00:59.040> innovative

part of the whole overall process so we

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:13.010 
part of the whole overall process so we

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:22.600 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:24.360 

similar<00:01:23.380> to<00:01:23.560> what's<00:01:23.710> happening<00:01:24.100> in<00:01:24.190> other

Alberta's infrastructure is aging

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:29.670 
Alberta's infrastructure is aging
therefore<00:01:28.420> there's<00:01:28.600> a<00:01:28.660> requirement<00:01:29.230> for<00:01:29.620> us

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:29.680 
therefore there's a requirement for us

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:33.270 
therefore there's a requirement for us

to make investment into new systems as

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:34.920 
to make investment into new systems as
we<00:01:33.430> move<00:01:33.640> forward<00:01:33.850> and<00:01:34.210> as<00:01:34.390> we<00:01:34.540> get<00:01:34.720> new

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:34.930 
we move forward and as we get new

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:36.390 
we move forward and as we get new
standards<00:01:35.440> in<00:01:35.560> place<00:01:35.680> we're<00:01:35.980> going<00:01:36.160> to<00:01:36.280> have

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:38.440 
to make an investment so we want to go

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:39.960 
to make an investment so we want to go
out<00:01:38.530> and<00:01:38.650> talk<00:01:38.800> to<00:01:38.830> Albertans<00:01:39.400> in<00:01:39.580> terms<00:01:39.820> of
