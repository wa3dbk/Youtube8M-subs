a chunky line for this one it's the kind
of<00:01:53.450> thing<00:01:53.630> that<00:01:53.659> as<00:01:53.929> you<00:01:54.079> go<00:01:54.200> along<00:01:54.349> you'll<00:01:54.770> get

00:01:54.909 --> 00:01:54.919 
of thing that as you go along you'll get

00:01:54.919 --> 00:01:55.629 
of thing that as you go along you'll get
the<00:01:55.039> hang<00:01:55.219> of<00:01:55.310> it

00:01:55.629 --> 00:01:55.639 
the hang of it

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:57.849 
the hang of it
so<00:01:55.999> through<00:01:56.209> two<00:01:56.419> through<00:01:56.840> two<00:01:57.109> through<00:01:57.560> two

00:01:57.849 --> 00:01:57.859 
so through two through two through two

00:01:57.859 --> 00:02:00.669 
so through two through two through two
and<00:01:58.159> then<00:01:58.429> through<00:01:58.819> the<00:01:59.090> last<00:01:59.299> two<00:01:59.689> from<00:02:00.439> here

00:02:00.669 --> 00:02:00.679 
and then through the last two from here

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:01.959 
and then through the last two from here
what<00:02:00.829> we're<00:02:00.919> going<00:02:01.039> to<00:02:01.069> do<00:02:01.219> is<00:02:01.340> chain<00:02:01.609> three

00:02:01.959 --> 00:02:01.969 
what we're going to do is chain three

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:07.209 
what we're going to do is chain three
one<00:02:02.739> two<00:02:03.739> three<00:02:04.239> and<00:02:05.349> then<00:02:06.349> I'm<00:02:06.560> going<00:02:06.770> to<00:02:06.889> just

00:02:07.209 --> 00:02:07.219 
one two three and then I'm going to just

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:11.620 
one two three and then I'm going to just
single<00:02:08.800> or<00:02:09.800> just<00:02:10.039> slip<00:02:10.280> stitch<00:02:10.580> into<00:02:11.030> the

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:11.630 
single or just slip stitch into the

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:13.690 
single or just slip stitch into the
third<00:02:11.900> from<00:02:12.170> the<00:02:12.200> hook<00:02:12.500> that<00:02:13.160> gives<00:02:13.430> us<00:02:13.550> a

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:13.700 
third from the hook that gives us a

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:15.970 
third from the hook that gives us a
little<00:02:13.850> bottom<00:02:14.270> on<00:02:14.420> our<00:02:14.600> angel<00:02:14.960> wing<00:02:15.170> the<00:02:15.650> next

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:15.980 
little bottom on our angel wing the next

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:18.280 
little bottom on our angel wing the next
we're<00:02:16.100> going<00:02:16.190> to<00:02:16.250> do<00:02:16.490> chain<00:02:16.820> five<00:02:17.150> one

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290 
we're going to do chain five one

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:26.510 
we're going to do chain five one
two<00:02:19.400> three<00:02:22.610> four<00:02:23.610> five<00:02:24.800> all<00:02:25.800> of<00:02:26.130> these<00:02:26.310> are

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:26.520 
two three four five all of these are

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:29.000 
two three four five all of these are
being<00:02:26.640> worked<00:02:26.970> into<00:02:27.270> that<00:02:27.300> first<00:02:27.720> chain<00:02:28.010> we're

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
being worked into that first chain we're

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:30.500 
being worked into that first chain we're
going<00:02:29.160> to<00:02:29.220> slip<00:02:29.400> stitch<00:02:29.700> into<00:02:29.940> that<00:02:30.060> first

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
going to slip stitch into that first

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:32.990 
going to slip stitch into that first
chain<00:02:30.900> that<00:02:31.680> we've<00:02:31.800> worked<00:02:31.950> everything<00:02:32.610> into

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
chain that we've worked everything into

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.660 
chain that we've worked everything into
and<00:02:33.240> that's<00:02:33.720> one<00:02:34.170> half<00:02:34.440> of<00:02:34.560> our<00:02:34.680> wing<00:02:34.920> already

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
and that's one half of our wing already

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:36.560 
and that's one half of our wing already
done<00:02:35.880> now<00:02:36.030> we're<00:02:36.150> going<00:02:36.240> to<00:02:36.330> go<00:02:36.420> the<00:02:36.540> other

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:36.570 
done now we're going to go the other

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:39.790 
done now we're going to go the other
side<00:02:36.990> we're<00:02:37.200> going<00:02:37.290> to<00:02:37.380> chain<00:02:37.650> eight<00:02:37.920> one<00:02:38.820> two

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:39.800 
side we're going to chain eight one two

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:44.450 
side we're going to chain eight one two
three<00:02:40.800> four<00:02:41.990> five<00:02:42.990> and<00:02:43.530> that's<00:02:43.860> equivalent<00:02:44.160> to

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:44.460 
three four five and that's equivalent to

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:46.430 
three four five and that's equivalent to
this<00:02:44.640> five<00:02:44.880> here<00:02:45.270> and<00:02:45.660> then<00:02:45.810> another<00:02:45.930> three

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
this five here and then another three

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:49.280 
this five here and then another three
will<00:02:46.620> give<00:02:46.800> us<00:02:46.920> eight<00:02:47.100> and<00:02:47.930> we're<00:02:48.930> going<00:02:49.140> to

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
will give us eight and we're going to

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:50.990 
will give us eight and we're going to
slip<00:02:49.590> stitch<00:02:49.620> into<00:02:50.100> the<00:02:50.340> third<00:02:50.370> chain<00:02:50.700> from

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
slip stitch into the third chain from

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.820 
slip stitch into the third chain from
the<00:02:51.270> hook<00:02:51.390> and<00:02:52.700> that<00:02:53.700> gives<00:02:53.940> us<00:02:54.090> a<00:02:54.210> matching

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:54.830 
the hook and that gives us a matching

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:57.770 
the hook and that gives us a matching
little<00:02:55.830> bobble<00:02:56.250> on<00:02:56.400> the<00:02:56.760> bottom<00:02:57.030> of<00:02:57.150> that<00:02:57.390> wing

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
little bobble on the bottom of that wing

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:59.900 
little bobble on the bottom of that wing
from<00:02:58.380> here<00:02:58.680> we're<00:02:58.950> working<00:02:59.190> in<00:02:59.490> Reverse<00:02:59.610> we're

00:02:59.900 --> 00:02:59.910 
from here we're working in Reverse we're

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:01.570 
from here we're working in Reverse we're
going<00:03:00.030> to<00:03:00.090> go<00:03:00.180> around<00:03:00.420> four<00:03:00.630> times<00:03:00.840> one<00:03:01.200> two

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:01.580 
going to go around four times one two

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:05.780 
going to go around four times one two
three<00:03:02.580> four<00:03:03.920> don't<00:03:04.920> have<00:03:05.100> it<00:03:05.190> too<00:03:05.370> tight<00:03:05.610> but

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
three four don't have it too tight but

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:07.700 
three four don't have it too tight but
certainly<00:03:06.090> don't<00:03:06.330> have<00:03:06.450> it<00:03:06.690> loose<00:03:06.870> working

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:07.710 
certainly don't have it loose working

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:11.240 
certainly don't have it loose working
into<00:03:07.950> that<00:03:08.630> same<00:03:09.630> hole<00:03:09.990> again<00:03:10.410> we're<00:03:11.100> going<00:03:11.190> to

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:15.520 
into that same hole again we're going to
come<00:03:11.490> through<00:03:11.520> two<00:03:12.200> through<00:03:13.200> two<00:03:13.760> through<00:03:14.760> two
