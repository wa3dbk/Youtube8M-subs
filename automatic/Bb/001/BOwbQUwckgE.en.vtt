questions<00:00:58.309> you<00:00:58.370> might<00:00:58.520> have<00:00:58.580> what's<00:00:59.090> a<00:00:59.270> rim

00:00:59.410 --> 00:00:59.420 
questions you might have what's a rim

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:01.420 
questions you might have what's a rim
job<00:00:59.480> I<00:00:59.989> would<00:01:00.410> guess<00:01:00.590> a<00:01:00.620> rim<00:01:00.710> job<00:01:00.860> is<00:01:01.070> when<00:01:01.250> you

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:01.430 
job I would guess a rim job is when you

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:02.590 
job I would guess a rim job is when you
kiss<00:01:01.580> someone<00:01:01.610> with<00:01:01.910> your<00:01:02.060> mouth<00:01:02.270> closed

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:02.600 
kiss someone with your mouth closed

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:04.240 
kiss someone with your mouth closed
that's<00:01:03.080> it<00:01:03.260> so<00:01:03.620> you're<00:01:03.740> only<00:01:03.830> using<00:01:03.950> the<00:01:04.160> rim

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:04.250 
that's it so you're only using the rim

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:06.580 
that's it so you're only using the rim
of<00:01:04.430> your<00:01:04.610> mouth<00:01:04.869> you're<00:01:05.869> not<00:01:06.020> too<00:01:06.170> old<00:01:06.200> to<00:01:06.440> let

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:06.590 
of your mouth you're not too old to let

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:11.340 
of your mouth you're not too old to let
your<00:01:06.650> dad<00:01:06.950> give<00:01:06.979> you<00:01:07.250> a<00:01:07.400> goodnight<00:01:08.119> rim<00:01:08.180> job
