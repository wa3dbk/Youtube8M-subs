00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:02.190 
so here we have another winter map for

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:05.539 
so here we have another winter map for
farming<00:00:02.639> simulator<00:00:02.939> 2015<00:00:03.899> and<00:00:04.190> this<00:00:05.190> one<00:00:05.430> has

00:00:05.539 --> 00:00:05.549 
farming simulator 2015 and this one has

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:07.369 
farming simulator 2015 and this one has
taken<00:00:05.700> the<00:00:05.940> step<00:00:06.180> further<00:00:06.480> to<00:00:06.870> the<00:00:07.020> previous

00:00:07.369 --> 00:00:07.379 
taken the step further to the previous

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:09.860 
taken the step further to the previous
one<00:00:07.529> which<00:00:07.680> I<00:00:07.770> did<00:00:07.950> where<00:00:08.730> the<00:00:09.300> snow<00:00:09.599> is

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:09.870 
one which I did where the snow is

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.430 
one which I did where the snow is
actually<00:00:10.200> snowflakes<00:00:10.860> and<00:00:11.599> also<00:00:12.599> you<00:00:13.080> have

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
actually snowflakes and also you have

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.700 
actually snowflakes and also you have
the<00:00:13.830> snow<00:00:14.070> on<00:00:14.190> the<00:00:14.280> trees<00:00:14.519> and<00:00:14.960> also<00:00:15.960> there<00:00:16.560> is

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
the snow on the trees and also there is

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.060 
the snow on the trees and also there is
more<00:00:16.740> in<00:00:17.250> the<00:00:17.820> way<00:00:17.940> of<00:00:17.970> snow<00:00:18.330> on<00:00:18.660> the<00:00:18.810> floor<00:00:19.140> now

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
more in the way of snow on the floor now

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:21.920 
more in the way of snow on the floor now
I've<00:00:20.400> got<00:00:20.609> this<00:00:20.699> tractor<00:00:21.090> here<00:00:21.300> with<00:00:21.779> this

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
I've got this tractor here with this

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.890 
I've got this tractor here with this
snowplow<00:00:22.199> which<00:00:22.560> I<00:00:22.710> found<00:00:23.160> a<00:00:23.430> mod<00:00:23.640> it<00:00:24.630> doesn't

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
snowplow which I found a mod it doesn't

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.960 
snowplow which I found a mod it doesn't
actually<00:00:25.230> pass<00:00:25.439> no<00:00:25.740> that's<00:00:26.189> one<00:00:26.400> thing<00:00:26.640> you

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
actually pass no that's one thing you

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.589 
actually pass no that's one thing you
can't<00:00:27.240> still<00:00:27.900> do<00:00:28.080> yet<00:00:28.699> you<00:00:29.699> cannot<00:00:30.150> plow<00:00:30.539> snow

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
can't still do yet you cannot plow snow

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:35.299 
can't still do yet you cannot plow snow
in<00:00:31.199> this<00:00:32.130> map<00:00:32.399> but<00:00:33.210> despite<00:00:34.200> that<00:00:34.230> it's<00:00:35.040> still

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
in this map but despite that it's still

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.970 
in this map but despite that it's still
a<00:00:35.520> very<00:00:35.730> well<00:00:36.239> made<00:00:36.649> modification<00:00:37.649> to<00:00:37.739> the<00:00:37.829> map

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
a very well made modification to the map

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.860 
a very well made modification to the map
so<00:00:38.850> I'm<00:00:38.910> going<00:00:39.059> to<00:00:39.090> take<00:00:39.239> it<00:00:39.390> around<00:00:39.480> anyway

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
so I'm going to take it around anyway

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.110 
so I'm going to take it around anyway
just<00:00:40.050> so<00:00:40.140> I<00:00:40.230> look<00:00:40.410> the<00:00:40.500> part<00:00:40.739> and<00:00:41.120> pretending

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
just so I look the part and pretending

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:43.720 
just so I look the part and pretending
I'm<00:00:42.239> plowing<00:00:42.510> snow<00:00:42.690> but<00:00:42.960> actually<00:00:43.230> I'm<00:00:43.290> not

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:43.730 
I'm plowing snow but actually I'm not

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:45.500 
I'm plowing snow but actually I'm not
but<00:00:44.730> what<00:00:44.850> I'm<00:00:44.910> going<00:00:45.000> to<00:00:45.059> do<00:00:45.210> is<00:00:45.300> going<00:00:45.420> to

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
but what I'm going to do is going to

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.720 
but what I'm going to do is going to
take<00:00:45.629> you<00:00:45.719> for<00:00:45.870> a<00:00:45.899> tour<00:00:46.140> and<00:00:46.550> obviously<00:00:47.550> you

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
take you for a tour and obviously you

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.040 
take you for a tour and obviously you
probably<00:00:48.149> already<00:00:48.270> know<00:00:48.510> this<00:00:48.629> map<00:00:48.840> because

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
probably already know this map because

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.799 
probably already know this map because
this<00:00:49.140> is<00:00:49.320> the<00:00:49.500> original<00:00:49.950> be<00:00:50.550> on<00:00:50.640> on<00:00:50.879> the<00:00:50.969> map<00:00:51.090> so

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
this is the original be on on the map so

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:52.700 
this is the original be on on the map so
the<00:00:51.899> first<00:00:52.110> thing<00:00:52.260> we're<00:00:52.350> going<00:00:52.440> to<00:00:52.500> show<00:00:52.590> you

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
the first thing we're going to show you

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.410 
the first thing we're going to show you
is<00:00:53.070> the<00:00:53.250> road<00:00:53.460> and<00:00:53.730> the<00:00:53.820> reason<00:00:54.059> for<00:00:54.149> that<00:00:54.239> is

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
is the road and the reason for that is

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.709 
is the road and the reason for that is
because<00:00:54.449> I<00:00:54.780> think<00:00:54.960> it's<00:00:55.079> been<00:00:55.230> very<00:00:55.260> well<00:00:55.590> done

00:00:56.709 --> 00:00:56.719 
because I think it's been very well done

00:00:56.719 --> 00:00:59.029 
because I think it's been very well done
the<00:00:57.719> traffic<00:00:58.079> is<00:00:58.230> still<00:00:58.379> traveling<00:00:58.620> at<00:00:58.859> same

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
the traffic is still traveling at same

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:02.540 
the traffic is still traveling at same
slow<00:00:59.640> pace<00:00:59.969> and<00:01:00.210> you<00:01:01.170> can<00:01:01.350> see<00:01:01.620> that<00:01:02.010> the<00:01:02.340> road

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
slow pace and you can see that the road

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.910 
slow pace and you can see that the road
is<00:01:02.820> actually<00:01:03.090> well<00:01:04.019> it<00:01:04.140> looks<00:01:04.290> treacherous

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
is actually well it looks treacherous

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.960 
is actually well it looks treacherous
but<00:01:05.420> there's<00:01:06.420> not<00:01:06.570> any<00:01:06.720> slipping<00:01:07.350> about<00:01:07.970> but

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
but there's not any slipping about but

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.700 
but there's not any slipping about but
it's<00:01:09.119> very<00:01:09.420> well<00:01:09.540> done<00:01:09.869> in<00:01:10.020> the<00:01:10.110> way<00:01:10.260> of<00:01:10.439> things

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
it's very well done in the way of things

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.830 
it's very well done in the way of things
that<00:01:11.010> you<00:01:11.460> can<00:01:11.640> see<00:01:11.880> each<00:01:12.119> side<00:01:12.420> of<00:01:12.570> the<00:01:12.630> road

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
that you can see each side of the road

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.929 
that you can see each side of the road
still<00:01:13.170> and<00:01:13.409> there's<00:01:13.619> no<00:01:14.010> tire<00:01:14.280> marks<00:01:14.310> over<00:01:14.850> the

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
still and there's no tire marks over the

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:17.510 
still and there's no tire marks over the
center<00:01:15.360> so<00:01:16.140> everyone's<00:01:16.439> still<00:01:16.770> sticking<00:01:17.400> to

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
center so everyone's still sticking to

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.030 
center so everyone's still sticking to
their<00:01:17.670> side<00:01:17.880> of<00:01:17.909> the<00:01:18.000> road<00:01:18.180> and<00:01:18.830> that<00:01:19.830> would<00:01:19.950> be

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
their side of the road and that would be

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.070 
their side of the road and that would be
amazing<00:01:20.220> if<00:01:20.549> there<00:01:20.790> was<00:01:20.939> actually<00:01:21.330> mod<00:01:21.600> to

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
amazing if there was actually mod to

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.719 
amazing if there was actually mod to
make<00:01:22.259> the<00:01:22.500> vehicle<00:01:22.860> slip<00:01:23.100> around<00:01:23.430> if<00:01:23.610> they

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
make the vehicle slip around if they

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.789 
make the vehicle slip around if they
were<00:01:23.790> going<00:01:23.939> too<00:01:24.090> quick<00:01:24.330> but<00:01:25.110> obviously<00:01:25.619> the

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
were going too quick but obviously the

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:28.010 
were going too quick but obviously the
cars<00:01:26.280> in<00:01:26.490> this<00:01:26.640> game<00:01:26.850> you<00:01:27.360> really<00:01:27.630> don't<00:01:27.780> seem

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
cars in this game you really don't seem

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.749 
cars in this game you really don't seem
to<00:01:28.110> get<00:01:28.229> above<00:01:28.470> 20<00:01:28.920> miles<00:01:29.100> an<00:01:29.220> hour<00:01:29.280> so<00:01:29.610> we're

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
to get above 20 miles an hour so we're

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:30.530 
to get above 20 miles an hour so we're
not<00:01:29.820> going

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
not going

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.960 
not going
but<00:01:31.540> I<00:01:31.750> can<00:01:32.020> say<00:01:32.200> that<00:01:32.440> Matt<00:01:32.680> is<00:01:32.860> well<00:01:33.400> done<00:01:33.640> the

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:33.970 
but I can say that Matt is well done the

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:35.760 
but I can say that Matt is well done the
road<00:01:34.150> is<00:01:34.330> very<00:01:34.690> well<00:01:34.870> done<00:01:35.080> you<00:01:35.350> can<00:01:35.500> even<00:01:35.620> see

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:35.770 
road is very well done you can even see

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:38.160 
road is very well done you can even see
the<00:01:35.860> tire<00:01:36.100> marks<00:01:36.130> in<00:01:36.490> the<00:01:36.580> road<00:01:36.990> from<00:01:37.990> the

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:38.170 
the tire marks in the road from the

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:41.580 
the tire marks in the road from the
traffic<00:01:38.610> and<00:01:39.610> also<00:01:40.060> the<00:01:40.540> grass<00:01:40.870> verges<00:01:41.290> are

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:41.590 
traffic and also the grass verges are

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:43.620 
traffic and also the grass verges are
very<00:01:42.010> snowy<00:01:42.430> but<00:01:42.970> you<00:01:43.060> can<00:01:43.270> still<00:01:43.480> see<00:01:43.570> the

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:43.630 
very snowy but you can still see the

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:45.600 
very snowy but you can still see the
grass<00:01:43.810> through<00:01:43.960> which<00:01:44.200> is<00:01:44.350> nice<00:01:44.530> it's<00:01:45.370> just

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:45.610 
grass through which is nice it's just

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:48.030 
grass through which is nice it's just
got<00:01:45.760> a<00:01:45.790> snow<00:01:46.090> texture<00:01:46.600> on<00:01:46.690> it<00:01:46.720> and<00:01:47.710> if<00:01:47.830> you<00:01:47.920> look

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:48.040 
got a snow texture on it and if you look

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:49.380 
got a snow texture on it and if you look
carefully<00:01:48.220> the<00:01:48.670> snow<00:01:48.880> flakes<00:01:49.120> which<00:01:49.270> are

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:49.390 
carefully the snow flakes which are

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:51.960 
carefully the snow flakes which are
falling<00:01:49.750> actually<00:01:50.140> are<00:01:50.290> snow<00:01:50.620> flakes<00:01:50.890> and<00:01:51.100> the

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:51.970 
falling actually are snow flakes and the

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:53.610 
falling actually are snow flakes and the
way<00:01:52.090> this<00:01:52.210> has<00:01:52.360> been<00:01:52.390> done<00:01:52.570> is<00:01:53.080> by<00:01:53.350> changing

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:53.620 
way this has been done is by changing

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:58.500 
way this has been done is by changing
the<00:01:53.920> rain<00:01:54.220> and<00:01:54.610> fall<00:01:56.310> texture<00:01:57.310> it's<00:01:58.000> no<00:01:58.330> longer

00:01:58.500 --> 00:01:58.510 
the rain and fall texture it's no longer

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:02.340 
the rain and fall texture it's no longer
a<00:01:59.040> water<00:02:00.040> droplet<00:02:00.400> it's<00:02:01.150> now<00:02:01.540> an<00:02:01.780> actual<00:02:01.930> snow

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:02.350 
a water droplet it's now an actual snow

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:05.430 
a water droplet it's now an actual snow
flake<00:02:02.620> and<00:02:03.660> now<00:02:04.660> one<00:02:04.900> thing<00:02:05.110> this<00:02:05.200> map

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:05.440 
flake and now one thing this map

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:08.250 
flake and now one thing this map
actually<00:02:05.620> does<00:02:06.160> do<00:02:06.520> is<00:02:06.850> the<00:02:07.510> way<00:02:07.690> to<00:02:07.750> install

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:08.260 
actually does do is the way to install

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:12.000 
actually does do is the way to install
it<00:02:08.560> you<00:02:09.310> actually<00:02:09.460> have<00:02:09.820> to<00:02:10.090> overwrite<00:02:11.080> your

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.010 
it you actually have to overwrite your

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:16.560 
it you actually have to overwrite your
original<00:02:12.730> map<00:02:12.940> and<00:02:13.650> textures<00:02:14.650> and<00:02:14.800> files<00:02:15.640> so

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:16.570 
original map and textures and files so

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:18.270 
original map and textures and files so
what<00:02:16.990> you<00:02:17.080> have<00:02:17.200> to<00:02:17.230> do<00:02:17.470> is<00:02:17.680> actually<00:02:17.860> back<00:02:18.250> up

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
what you have to do is actually back up

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.910 
what you have to do is actually back up
your<00:02:19.150> original<00:02:19.840> map<00:02:19.990> files<00:02:20.320> so<00:02:20.770> you<00:02:20.830> can

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920 
your original map files so you can

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:22.530 
your original map files so you can
retrieve<00:02:21.340> them<00:02:21.610> if<00:02:21.790> you<00:02:21.970> ever<00:02:22.090> want<00:02:22.270> to<00:02:22.300> change

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.540 
retrieve them if you ever want to change

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:26.610 
retrieve them if you ever want to change
back<00:02:23.040> this<00:02:24.040> isn't<00:02:24.580> the<00:02:24.880> map<00:02:25.180> this<00:02:26.020> isn't<00:02:26.290> a<00:02:26.380> mod

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
back this isn't the map this isn't a mod

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:28.170 
back this isn't the map this isn't a mod
which<00:02:26.950> you<00:02:27.100> can<00:02:27.250> put<00:02:27.430> into<00:02:27.640> your<00:02:27.730> mods<00:02:27.940> folder

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180 
which you can put into your mods folder

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:31.260 
which you can put into your mods folder
you<00:02:29.140> will<00:02:29.350> not<00:02:29.500> work<00:02:29.920> if<00:02:30.190> you<00:02:30.310> do<00:02:30.460> that<00:02:30.640> you

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:31.270 
you will not work if you do that you

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:34.110 
you will not work if you do that you
actually<00:02:31.300> have<00:02:31.870> to<00:02:31.900> backup<00:02:32.290> your<00:02:33.120> original

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.120 
actually have to backup your original

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:37.199 
actually have to backup your original
map<00:02:34.270> and<00:02:34.510> you<00:02:35.140> have<00:02:35.290> to<00:02:35.410> overwrite<00:02:35.920> them<00:02:36.700> with

00:02:37.199 --> 00:02:37.209 
map and you have to overwrite them with

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:38.710 
map and you have to overwrite them with
these<00:02:37.510> files

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:38.720 
these files

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:40.240 
these files
so<00:02:39.260> it's<00:02:39.350> really<00:02:39.500> important<00:02:39.860> that<00:02:39.890> yes<00:02:40.100> you're

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.250 
so it's really important that yes you're

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:42.160 
so it's really important that yes you're
back<00:02:40.400> up<00:02:40.550> that's<00:02:41.270> if<00:02:41.510> you<00:02:41.600> want<00:02:41.630> to<00:02:41.900> get<00:02:42.020> your

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:42.170 
back up that's if you want to get your

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:44.370 
back up that's if you want to get your
original<00:02:42.230> map<00:02:42.650> back<00:02:42.950> of<00:02:43.130> course

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:44.380 
original map back of course

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:47.760 
original map back of course
so<00:02:45.280> I<00:02:45.580> think<00:02:46.180> we<00:02:46.630> can<00:02:46.750> clearly<00:02:47.080> see<00:02:47.410> that<00:02:47.440> it's

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:47.770 
so I think we can clearly see that it's

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:49.800 
so I think we can clearly see that it's
snowing<00:02:48.190> I<00:02:48.400> actually<00:02:48.880> had<00:02:49.150> to<00:02:49.240> wait<00:02:49.450> quite<00:02:49.780> a

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:49.810 
snowing I actually had to wait quite a

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:52.290 
snowing I actually had to wait quite a
while<00:02:50.050> to<00:02:50.230> get<00:02:50.320> the<00:02:50.440> snow<00:02:50.680> to<00:02:50.740> come<00:02:51.300> because

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:52.300 
while to get the snow to come because

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:54.660 
while to get the snow to come because
this<00:02:52.600> is<00:02:52.720> going<00:02:52.960> by<00:02:53.170> the<00:02:53.230> original<00:02:54.040> games

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:54.670 
this is going by the original games

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:57.690 
this is going by the original games
speed<00:02:55.540> I<00:02:55.780> put<00:02:56.320> in<00:02:56.500> 120<00:02:57.070> and<00:02:57.190> sort<00:02:57.430> of<00:02:57.550> move

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:57.700 
speed I put in 120 and sort of move

00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:59.730 
speed I put in 120 and sort of move
quite<00:02:57.910> a<00:02:57.940> while<00:02:58.150> but<00:02:58.750> we're<00:02:59.050> here<00:02:59.230> now<00:02:59.410> and<00:02:59.650> it

00:02:59.730 --> 00:02:59.740 
quite a while but we're here now and it

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:01.980 
quite a while but we're here now and it
is<00:02:59.890> snow<00:03:00.130> one<00:03:01.120> thing<00:03:01.270> to<00:03:01.360> point<00:03:01.540> out<00:03:01.750> the

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:01.990 
is snow one thing to point out the

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:06.150 
is snow one thing to point out the
fields<00:03:02.560> do<00:03:02.770> not<00:03:02.800> have<00:03:03.250> snow<00:03:03.490> on<00:03:04.590> so<00:03:05.590> that<00:03:05.860> is

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:06.160 
fields do not have snow on so that is

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:07.590 
fields do not have snow on so that is
still<00:03:06.430> something<00:03:06.550> which<00:03:06.850> needs<00:03:07.060> to<00:03:07.150> be<00:03:07.240> worked

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:07.600 
still something which needs to be worked

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:11.010 
still something which needs to be worked
on<00:03:07.870> but<00:03:08.680> like<00:03:09.610> I<00:03:09.640> say<00:03:09.940> it's<00:03:10.210> looking<00:03:10.510> a<00:03:10.780> lot

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:11.020 
on but like I say it's looking a lot

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:13.800 
on but like I say it's looking a lot
more<00:03:11.230> wintery<00:03:11.620> now<00:03:12.100> we've<00:03:12.550> got<00:03:12.730> this<00:03:12.910> now<00:03:13.780> I

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:13.810 
more wintery now we've got this now I

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:16.800 
more wintery now we've got this now I
did<00:03:14.050> review<00:03:14.680> that<00:03:15.100> previous<00:03:15.760> map<00:03:15.970> which<00:03:16.630> is

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:16.810 
did review that previous map which is

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:18.570 
did review that previous map which is
still<00:03:17.260> a<00:03:17.440> really<00:03:17.770> good<00:03:17.950> map<00:03:18.160> and<00:03:18.460> I<00:03:18.520> do

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:18.580 
still a really good map and I do

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:21.000 
still a really good map and I do
recommend<00:03:19.090> downloading<00:03:19.330> it<00:03:19.890> that<00:03:20.890> was

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:21.010 
recommend downloading it that was

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:23.760 
recommend downloading it that was
snowing<00:03:21.370> but<00:03:21.940> this<00:03:22.390> one<00:03:22.630> has<00:03:22.840> got<00:03:23.020> a<00:03:23.320> little

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:23.770 
snowing but this one has got a little

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:25.430 
snowing but this one has got a little
bit<00:03:24.010> more<00:03:24.190> it's<00:03:24.310> gone<00:03:24.430> a<00:03:24.460> step<00:03:24.610> further<00:03:24.970> and

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.440 
bit more it's gone a step further and

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:29.600 
bit more it's gone a step further and
it's<00:03:26.440> got<00:03:26.740> things<00:03:27.550> like<00:03:27.700> this<00:03:27.850> down<00:03:28.090> the<00:03:28.240> trees

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:29.610 
it's got things like this down the trees

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:33.120 
it's got things like this down the trees
the<00:03:30.610> trees<00:03:30.850> do<00:03:31.270> still<00:03:31.690> have<00:03:31.930> their<00:03:32.200> leaves<00:03:32.500> but

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:33.130 
the trees do still have their leaves but

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:34.530 
the trees do still have their leaves but
they've<00:03:33.310> now<00:03:33.490> got<00:03:33.670> the<00:03:33.790> snowy<00:03:34.000> texture<00:03:34.420> on

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:34.540 
they've now got the snowy texture on

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:37.380 
they've now got the snowy texture on
them<00:03:34.720> so<00:03:35.680> it's<00:03:35.830> not<00:03:35.890> 100%<00:03:36.340> winter<00:03:36.790> you

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:37.390 
them so it's not 100% winter you

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:39.240 
them so it's not 100% winter you
wouldn't<00:03:37.600> expect<00:03:37.780> the<00:03:38.020> pine<00:03:38.650> tree<00:03:38.830> settle

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:39.250 
wouldn't expect the pine tree settle

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:42.090 
wouldn't expect the pine tree settle
easily<00:03:39.580> so<00:03:39.760> that's<00:03:39.910> realistic<00:03:40.240> and<00:03:40.950> but<00:03:41.950> these

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:42.100 
easily so that's realistic and but these

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:44.400 
easily so that's realistic and but these
are<00:03:42.370> a<00:03:42.550> tree<00:03:43.390> these<00:03:43.600> are<00:03:43.720> deciduous<00:03:44.200> trees

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:44.410 
are a tree these are deciduous trees

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:46.470 
are a tree these are deciduous trees
neighborhood<00:03:44.920> leaves<00:03:45.160> loser<00:03:45.580> leaves<00:03:45.910> but

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:46.480 
neighborhood leaves loser leaves but

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:47.910 
neighborhood leaves loser leaves but
having<00:03:46.750> said<00:03:46.870> that<00:03:46.930> it<00:03:47.260> really<00:03:47.590> does<00:03:47.740> matter

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:47.920 
having said that it really does matter

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:49.560 
having said that it really does matter
you<00:03:48.220> can't<00:03:48.490> even<00:03:48.670> tell<00:03:49.000> if<00:03:49.120> you<00:03:49.210> don't<00:03:49.360> think

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:49.570 
you can't even tell if you don't think

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:52.620 
you can't even tell if you don't think
about<00:03:49.660> it<00:03:49.960> and<00:03:50.400> it's<00:03:51.400> still<00:03:51.730> wintery<00:03:52.120> and<00:03:52.300> for

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:52.630 
about it and it's still wintery and for

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:54.180 
about it and it's still wintery and for
this<00:03:52.690> time<00:03:52.900> of<00:03:52.930> year<00:03:53.080> it's<00:03:53.530> perfect

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:54.190 
this time of year it's perfect

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:55.530 
this time of year it's perfect
so<00:03:54.370> this<00:03:54.610> is<00:03:54.760> going<00:03:54.880> to<00:03:54.940> be<00:03:55.090> a<00:03:55.300> very

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:55.540 
so this is going to be a very

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:57.060 
so this is going to be a very
Christmassy<00:03:56.140> mod<00:03:56.320> I<00:03:56.350> would<00:03:56.620> say<00:03:56.800> I<00:03:56.980> think

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:57.070 
Christmassy mod I would say I think

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:58.200 
Christmassy mod I would say I think
quite<00:03:57.490> a<00:03:57.550> lot<00:03:57.610> of<00:03:57.790> people<00:03:58.000> will<00:03:58.090> be

00:03:58.200 --> 00:03:58.210 
quite a lot of people will be

00:03:58.210 --> 00:03:59.670 
quite a lot of people will be
downloading<00:03:58.690> it<00:03:58.780> and<00:03:58.900> I'm<00:03:59.410> highly

00:03:59.670 --> 00:03:59.680 
downloading it and I'm highly

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:02.340 
downloading it and I'm highly
recommending<00:03:59.770> it<00:04:00.750> so<00:04:01.750> I<00:04:01.780> think<00:04:01.900> what<00:04:02.050> we'll<00:04:02.200> do

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:02.350 
recommending it so I think what we'll do

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:03.990 
recommending it so I think what we'll do
is<00:04:02.440> we'll<00:04:02.500> pull<00:04:02.710> over<00:04:02.860> here<00:04:03.100> and<00:04:03.310> we'll<00:04:03.550> a

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:04.000 
is we'll pull over here and we'll a

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.540 
is we'll pull over here and we'll a
little<00:04:04.450> bit<00:04:04.660> of<00:04:04.750> a<00:04:04.810> walk<00:04:05.110> in<00:04:05.320> this<00:04:05.470> the<00:04:06.220> wooded

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:06.550 
little bit of a walk in this the wooded

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:10.860 
little bit of a walk in this the wooded
area<00:04:06.880> and<00:04:07.890> see<00:04:08.890> what<00:04:09.070> we<00:04:09.160> can<00:04:09.280> do<00:04:09.490> even<00:04:10.450> the

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:10.870 
area and see what we can do even the

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:12.480 
area and see what we can do even the
fence<00:04:11.140> posts<00:04:11.500> here<00:04:11.620> have<00:04:11.860> got<00:04:12.010> snow<00:04:12.220> on<00:04:12.250> them

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:12.490 
fence posts here have got snow on them

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:15.960 
fence posts here have got snow on them
so<00:04:13.330> that's<00:04:13.480> nice<00:04:13.810> if<00:04:14.710> the<00:04:14.890> snow<00:04:15.400> was<00:04:15.550> driving

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:15.970 
so that's nice if the snow was driving

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:17.849 
so that's nice if the snow was driving
in<00:04:16.060> at<00:04:16.180> an<00:04:16.270> angle<00:04:16.570> you<00:04:16.780> can<00:04:17.380> still<00:04:17.560> see<00:04:17.710> a<00:04:17.739> bit

00:04:17.849 --> 00:04:17.859 
in at an angle you can still see a bit

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:19.229 
in at an angle you can still see a bit
of<00:04:17.890> green<00:04:18.130> from<00:04:18.280> the<00:04:18.370> grass<00:04:18.549> in<00:04:18.700> there<00:04:18.880> so

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:19.239 
of green from the grass in there so

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:21.810 
of green from the grass in there so
that's<00:04:19.390> nice<00:04:19.600> too<00:04:19.840> and<00:04:20.070> all<00:04:21.070> of<00:04:21.310> the<00:04:21.430> textures

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:21.820 
that's nice too and all of the textures

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:26.160 
that's nice too and all of the textures
in<00:04:21.940> here<00:04:22.180> I've<00:04:23.050> got<00:04:23.820> snow<00:04:24.820> on<00:04:24.850> them<00:04:25.120> now<00:04:25.930> one

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:26.170 
in here I've got snow on them now one

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:28.860 
in here I've got snow on them now one
thing<00:04:26.350> one<00:04:26.890> thing<00:04:26.920> to<00:04:27.100> point<00:04:27.250> out<00:04:27.460> here<00:04:27.870> some

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:28.870 
thing one thing to point out here some

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:30.330 
thing one thing to point out here some
of<00:04:28.960> the<00:04:29.020> areas<00:04:29.320> under<00:04:29.470> the<00:04:29.770> trees<00:04:30.010> which<00:04:30.250> are

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:30.340 
of the areas under the trees which are

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:32.880 
of the areas under the trees which are
covered<00:04:30.550> by<00:04:31.300> the<00:04:31.360> canopy<00:04:31.780> haven't<00:04:32.560> got<00:04:32.680> snow

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:32.890 
covered by the canopy haven't got snow

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:35.090 
covered by the canopy haven't got snow
on<00:04:32.920> which<00:04:33.310> is<00:04:33.460> nice<00:04:33.610> so<00:04:33.640> it's<00:04:34.000> not<00:04:34.120> 100%<00:04:34.480> snow

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:35.100 
on which is nice so it's not 100% snow

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:37.350 
on which is nice so it's not 100% snow
you<00:04:36.100> still<00:04:36.340> got<00:04:36.460> those<00:04:36.550> protected<00:04:37.060> areas

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:37.360 
you still got those protected areas

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:39.030 
you still got those protected areas
because<00:04:37.600> unless<00:04:37.840> it<00:04:37.990> was<00:04:38.110> a<00:04:38.140> really<00:04:38.590> intense

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:39.040 
because unless it was a really intense

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:40.950 
because unless it was a really intense
snowfall<00:04:39.370> you<00:04:40.210> would<00:04:40.390> still<00:04:40.600> have<00:04:40.750> areas

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:40.960 
snowfall you would still have areas

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:43.610 
snowfall you would still have areas
which<00:04:41.350> did<00:04:41.560> not<00:04:41.680> get<00:04:41.890> covered<00:04:42.220> in<00:04:42.340> wooded<00:04:43.180> area

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:43.620 
which did not get covered in wooded area

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:47.160 
which did not get covered in wooded area
so<00:04:44.620> clearly<00:04:45.130> this<00:04:45.460> is<00:04:45.520> a<00:04:46.060> very<00:04:46.930> picturesque

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:47.170 
so clearly this is a very picturesque

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:50.310 
so clearly this is a very picturesque
mod<00:04:47.680> and<00:04:48.180> definitely<00:04:49.180> I<00:04:49.420> can<00:04:49.570> say<00:04:49.840> fitting

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:50.320 
mod and definitely I can say fitting

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:52.070 
mod and definitely I can say fitting
this<00:04:50.440> time<00:04:50.680> of<00:04:50.830> year

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:52.080 
this time of year

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:56.860 
this time of year
and<00:04:53.030> well<00:04:54.030> it's<00:04:54.780> certainly<00:04:55.050> an<00:04:55.440> exciting<00:04:55.949> mod

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:56.870 
and well it's certainly an exciting mod

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:59.600 
and well it's certainly an exciting mod
but<00:04:57.870> it's<00:04:58.110> very<00:04:58.349> important<00:04:58.919> if<00:04:59.069> you<00:04:59.129> install

00:04:59.600 --> 00:04:59.610 
but it's very important if you install

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:01.460 
but it's very important if you install
it<00:04:59.819> like<00:04:59.940> I<00:04:59.970> keep<00:05:00.210> saying<00:05:00.270> that<00:05:01.080> you<00:05:01.199> backup

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:01.470 
it like I keep saying that you backup

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:06.350 
it like I keep saying that you backup
your<00:05:01.710> original<00:05:02.580> files<00:05:04.520> so<00:05:05.520> it<00:05:05.819> would<00:05:06.090> be<00:05:06.210> nice

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:06.360 
your original files so it would be nice

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:08.899 
your original files so it would be nice
if<00:05:06.389> the<00:05:06.930> snow<00:05:07.530> settled<00:05:07.740> and<00:05:08.129> you<00:05:08.759> could

00:05:08.899 --> 00:05:08.909 
if the snow settled and you could

00:05:08.909 --> 00:05:12.680 
if the snow settled and you could
actually<00:05:10.159> plan<00:05:11.159> the<00:05:11.340> snow<00:05:11.520> that<00:05:12.419> would<00:05:12.569> be

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:12.690 
actually plan the snow that would be

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:15.920 
actually plan the snow that would be
nice<00:05:12.860> that<00:05:13.860> mod<00:05:14.099> was<00:05:14.340> implemented<00:05:14.940> into<00:05:15.240> 2008

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:15.930 
nice that mod was implemented into 2008

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:18.200 
nice that mod was implemented into 2008
and<00:05:16.379> I'm<00:05:16.500> not<00:05:16.710> sure<00:05:16.919> if<00:05:17.009> it<00:05:17.129> was<00:05:17.190> put<00:05:17.340> into<00:05:17.490> 2009

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:18.210 
and I'm not sure if it was put into 2009

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:21.529 
and I'm not sure if it was put into 2009
and<00:05:18.750> beyond<00:05:19.259> I<00:05:19.819> think<00:05:20.819> it<00:05:21.150> was

00:05:21.529 --> 00:05:21.539 
and beyond I think it was

00:05:21.539 --> 00:05:23.899 
and beyond I think it was
I<00:05:21.569> never<00:05:22.229> downloaded<00:05:22.650> it<00:05:22.800> myself<00:05:23.190> though<00:05:23.639> now

00:05:23.899 --> 00:05:23.909 
I never downloaded it myself though now

00:05:23.909 --> 00:05:25.700 
I never downloaded it myself though now
if<00:05:24.000> that<00:05:24.030> could<00:05:24.270> somehow<00:05:24.479> be<00:05:24.780> recreated<00:05:25.289> and

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:25.710 
if that could somehow be recreated and

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:29.570 
if that could somehow be recreated and
put<00:05:26.520> into<00:05:26.669> FS<00:05:27.419> 15<00:05:27.870> then<00:05:28.800> that<00:05:29.219> would<00:05:29.400> be

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:29.580 
put into FS 15 then that would be

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:31.850 
put into FS 15 then that would be
amazing<00:05:29.909> if<00:05:30.210> you<00:05:30.240> could<00:05:30.449> physically<00:05:31.169> push<00:05:31.590> the

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:31.860 
amazing if you could physically push the

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:33.800 
amazing if you could physically push the
snow<00:05:32.099> I<00:05:32.370> don't<00:05:33.330> know<00:05:33.389> if<00:05:33.449> you<00:05:33.509> press<00:05:33.690> it

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:33.810 
snow I don't know if you press it

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:35.059 
snow I don't know if you press it
actually<00:05:34.020> push<00:05:34.259> it<00:05:34.469> or<00:05:34.650> if<00:05:34.770> it<00:05:34.919> would<00:05:35.039> just

00:05:35.059 --> 00:05:35.069 
actually push it or if it would just

00:05:35.069 --> 00:05:36.860 
actually push it or if it would just
sort<00:05:35.310> of<00:05:35.430> clay<00:05:35.729> and<00:05:35.909> disappear<00:05:36.419> when<00:05:36.599> you<00:05:36.690> push

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:36.870 
sort of clay and disappear when you push

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:41.089 
sort of clay and disappear when you push
it<00:05:36.900> but<00:05:37.229> that<00:05:37.349> would<00:05:37.500> be<00:05:37.530> nice<00:05:37.740> but<00:05:39.650> every<00:05:40.650> time

00:05:41.089 --> 00:05:41.099 
it but that would be nice but every time

00:05:41.099 --> 00:05:43.339 
it but that would be nice but every time
I<00:05:41.129> do<00:05:41.340> one<00:05:41.460> of<00:05:41.699> these<00:05:41.789> reviews<00:05:42.180> of<00:05:42.389> these<00:05:43.080> maps

00:05:43.339 --> 00:05:43.349 
I do one of these reviews of these maps

00:05:43.349 --> 00:05:45.740 
I do one of these reviews of these maps
they're<00:05:44.099> getting<00:05:44.340> one<00:05:44.490> step<00:05:44.669> further<00:05:44.969> so<00:05:45.659> if

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:45.750 
they're getting one step further so if

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:47.270 
they're getting one step further so if
we<00:05:45.870> can<00:05:45.990> go<00:05:46.080> another<00:05:46.169> step<00:05:46.409> then<00:05:47.009> that<00:05:47.159> would

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:47.280 
we can go another step then that would

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:47.950 
we can go another step then that would
be<00:05:47.310> amazing

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:47.960 
be amazing

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:49.730 
be amazing
obviously<00:05:48.960> it's<00:05:49.110> probably<00:05:49.409> not<00:05:49.469> gonna<00:05:49.620> be<00:05:49.710> too

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:49.740 
obviously it's probably not gonna be too

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:52.969 
obviously it's probably not gonna be too
easy<00:05:50.039> to<00:05:50.280> do<00:05:50.490> that<00:05:50.729> so<00:05:51.629> we<00:05:52.110> can't<00:05:52.349> really<00:05:52.680> and

00:05:52.969 --> 00:05:52.979 
easy to do that so we can't really and

00:05:52.979 --> 00:05:55.279 
easy to do that so we can't really and
hold<00:05:53.280> out<00:05:53.430> a<00:05:53.460> great<00:05:53.729> deal<00:05:53.909> of<00:05:53.969> hope<00:05:54.240> in<00:05:55.020> the<00:05:55.139> way

00:05:55.279 --> 00:05:55.289 
hold out a great deal of hope in the way

00:05:55.289 --> 00:05:57.980 
hold out a great deal of hope in the way
of<00:05:55.409> that<00:05:55.849> but<00:05:56.849> it<00:05:56.969> has<00:05:57.120> been<00:05:57.270> done<00:05:57.389> before<00:05:57.779> on

00:05:57.980 --> 00:05:57.990 
of that but it has been done before on

00:05:57.990 --> 00:05:59.839 
of that but it has been done before on
the<00:05:58.289> previous<00:05:58.650> version<00:05:58.979> so<00:05:59.219> hopefully

00:05:59.839 --> 00:05:59.849 
the previous version so hopefully

00:05:59.849 --> 00:06:02.870 
the previous version so hopefully
hopefully<00:06:00.840> someone<00:06:01.409> will<00:06:01.440> have<00:06:01.710> the<00:06:01.830> time<00:06:02.069> to

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:02.880 
hopefully someone will have the time to

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:04.260 
hopefully someone will have the time to
do<00:06:03.029> something<00:06:03.330> like<00:06:03.539> that

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:04.270 
do something like that

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:05.640 
do something like that
and<00:06:04.360> I'm<00:06:04.750> sure<00:06:04.990> it<00:06:05.229> would<00:06:05.319> be<00:06:05.410> greatly

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:05.650 
and I'm sure it would be greatly

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:08.339 
and I'm sure it would be greatly
