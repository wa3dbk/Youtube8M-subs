00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:04.659
 moments that women love too 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:06.759
 yes, my family would have mine 

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:08.560

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:15.099
 buddy and he also has harrison ford on 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:16.660
 first watch this movie with harrison 

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:21.099
 Ford fans were the weirs are pretty 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:23.200
 horny find there what can I eat to 

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:25.480
 that is actually the sea ​​is such a 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:26.590
 kind of thriller or I would do it 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:31.300
 to call shriller 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:31.959
 and maybe there you can 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:34.540
 say again 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:36.250
 with processes but because that's a movie 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:39.040
 since you have it so its partly individually 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:40.600
 with it and a bit of fingerfood though 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:45.340
 I would not weight much now 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:48.459
 might still claim kaká co 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:51.819
 then enjoy with this movie and this one 

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:54.100
 film is mine so there is one 

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:55.750
 price entertainment ratio yes and 

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:56.380
 That's because of his film, even if I did 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:58.840
 a great find 

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:00.519
 under ten euros this film can 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:02.170
 her right for under ten euros somehow 

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:03.250
 get and should you even consider 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:04.870
 I did not want to look at it now 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:07.959
 necessarily 15 euros flow movies go out 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:08.470
 That was a pretty old ten euro 

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:11.410
 worth more 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:12.970
 yes and what a continuation, so to speak 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:13.930
 is also a series mainzer steffen 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:16.450
 of course stands for itself 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:18.400
 and there I would me him 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:20.829
 harrison ford again as president 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:22.239
 industry but probably like one 

00:03:20.829 --> 00:03:25.209
 see little again as president and 

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:27.730
 That's why it's the harbor too 

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:29.920
 continuing to watch this movie says 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:33.760
 what can one say about the film? 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:35.440

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:37.060

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:44.829

00:03:44.829 --> 00:03:48.250
