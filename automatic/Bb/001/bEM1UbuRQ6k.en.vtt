this<00:01:11.350> material<00:01:11.590> here<00:01:12.160> is<00:01:12.220> a<00:01:12.370> kind<00:01:13.210> of<00:01:13.300> a<00:01:13.480> rough

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:13.870 
this material here is a kind of a rough

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:16.680 
this material here is a kind of a rough
suede<00:01:14.860> I<00:01:15.270> don't<00:01:16.270> think<00:01:16.390> it's<00:01:16.510> going<00:01:16.600> to

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:16.690 
suede I don't think it's going to

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:18.990 
suede I don't think it's going to
scratch<00:01:17.110> it<00:01:17.140> but<00:01:17.680> I<00:01:17.710> it's<00:01:18.160> not<00:01:18.430> the<00:01:18.580> softest

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:19.000 
scratch it but I it's not the softest

scratch it but I it's not the softest
material<00:01:23.130> this<00:01:24.130> is<00:01:24.190> very<00:01:24.490> similar<00:01:24.790> to<00:01:24.970> a<00:01:25.120> case

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:25.390

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:05.320 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:08.109 

you

00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:08.119 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:12.699 

but<00:02:08.720> if<00:02:08.869> you<00:02:08.959> look<00:02:09.170> close<00:02:09.560> enough<00:02:11.260> the<00:02:12.260> border

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:12.709 
but if you look close enough the border

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:14.860 
but if you look close enough the border
is<00:02:12.950> not<00:02:13.159> one<00:02:13.940> hundred<00:02:14.060> percent<00:02:14.269> straight

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:14.870 
is not one hundred percent straight

00:02:16.839 --> 00:02:16.849 
around the edge and it seems to be

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:19.000 
around the edge and it seems to be
almost<00:02:17.239> impossible<00:02:17.569> to<00:02:18.290> get<00:02:18.440> it<00:02:18.560> to<00:02:18.680> line<00:02:18.860> up

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.010 
almost impossible to get it to line up

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:21.339 
almost impossible to get it to line up
all<00:02:19.549> the<00:02:19.730> way<00:02:19.849> straight<00:02:19.930> I've<00:02:20.930> been<00:02:21.080> working

00:02:25.809 --> 00:02:25.819 
to get it to sit in the case perfectly

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:30.330 
to get it to sit in the case perfectly
straight<00:02:26.090> and<00:02:26.290> maybe<00:02:27.290> I'm<00:02:27.530> just<00:02:27.739> a

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:32.890 

perfectionist<00:02:31.340> but<00:02:31.970> I<00:02:32.030> like<00:02:32.269> for<00:02:32.540> it<00:02:32.599> to<00:02:32.629> sit

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:32.900 
perfectionist but I like for it to sit

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:35.199 
perfectionist but I like for it to sit
straight<00:02:33.290> and<00:02:33.560> it<00:02:33.890> doesn't<00:02:34.310> just<00:02:34.489> fit<00:02:34.970> all<00:02:35.120> the

straight and it doesn't just fit all the

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:37.089 
straight and it doesn't just fit all the
way<00:02:35.299> straight<00:02:35.360> I<00:02:35.720> mean<00:02:36.290> it's<00:02:36.440> fairly<00:02:36.739> straight

00:02:37.089 --> 00:02:37.099 
way straight I mean it's fairly straight

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:39.970 
way straight I mean it's fairly straight
it<00:02:37.390> is<00:02:38.390> hard<00:02:38.629> to<00:02:38.690> notice<00:02:38.930> but<00:02:39.530> if<00:02:39.650> you<00:02:39.739> look<00:02:39.860> at

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:39.980 
it is hard to notice but if you look at

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:42.940 
it is hard to notice but if you look at
the<00:02:40.010> borders<00:02:40.459> thicker<00:02:41.000> down<00:02:41.239> here<00:02:41.629> it<00:02:42.560> is<00:02:42.769> on

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:42.950 
the borders thicker down here it is on

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:46.869 
the borders thicker down here it is on
the<00:02:43.069> top<00:02:43.250> and<00:02:44.829> the<00:02:45.829> cameras<00:02:46.190> is<00:02:46.370> a<00:02:46.400> little<00:02:46.790> bit

00:02:46.869 --> 00:02:46.879 
the top and the cameras is a little bit

00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:55.899 
the top and the cameras is a little bit
off<00:02:51.790> but<00:02:52.790> if<00:02:52.970> you<00:02:53.090> can<00:02:53.269> deal<00:02:53.569> with<00:02:53.780> that<00:02:54.909> issue

00:02:55.899 --> 00:02:55.909 
off but if you can deal with that issue

00:02:55.909 --> 00:02:59.670 
off but if you can deal with that issue
I<00:02:56.829> mean<00:02:57.829> it's<00:02:57.980> actually<00:02:58.250> a<00:02:58.579> very<00:02:58.819> nice<00:02:59.120> case

00:02:59.670 --> 00:02:59.680 
I mean it's actually a very nice case

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:04.509 
I mean it's actually a very nice case
has<00:03:00.680> this<00:03:00.920> flap<00:03:01.190> on<00:03:01.370> the<00:03:01.400> back<00:03:03.040> so<00:03:04.040> let<00:03:04.159> me<00:03:04.310> use

00:03:04.509 --> 00:03:04.519 
has this flap on the back so let me use

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:06.309

as a kickstand which I'll show you here
in<00:03:06.379> a<00:03:06.440> minute<00:03:06.620> it<00:03:06.920> has<00:03:07.340> a<00:03:07.370> nice<00:03:08.269> cut<00:03:08.540> out<00:03:08.690> for

00:03:08.979 --> 00:03:08.989 
in a minute it has a nice cut out for

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:11.800

issues with the case or really the

issues with the case or really the
fitment<00:04:16.199> it's<00:04:16.590> just<00:04:16.769> not<00:04:17.060> exact<00:04:18.060> it's<00:04:18.810> just<00:04:18.989> a

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:19.049 
fitment it's just not exact it's just a

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:22.939 
fitment it's just not exact it's just a
little<00:04:19.500> bit<00:04:19.650> off<00:04:21.019> and<00:04:22.019> maybe<00:04:22.380> I'll<00:04:22.620> get<00:04:22.770> used

00:04:22.939 --> 00:04:22.949 
little bit off and maybe I'll get used

00:04:22.949 --> 00:04:25.790 
little bit off and maybe I'll get used
to<00:04:23.070> it<00:04:23.160> over<00:04:23.460> the<00:04:23.610> next<00:04:23.850> few<00:04:24.000> days<00:04:24.350> but<00:04:25.350> it's

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:25.800 
to it over the next few days but it's

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:26.990 
to it over the next few days but it's
why<00:04:25.919> anyway<00:04:26.250> they<00:04:26.400> know<00:04:26.550> then<00:04:26.760> when<00:04:26.850> you<00:04:26.910> get

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:27.000 
why anyway they know then when you get

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.930 
why anyway they know then when you get
this<00:04:27.150> case<00:04:27.419> the<00:04:27.750> unexpected<00:04:28.320> the<00:04:28.410> fit<00:04:28.620> and<00:04:28.940> one

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:29.940 
this case the unexpected the fit and one

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:31.840 
this case the unexpected the fit and one
hundred<00:04:30.270> percent<00:04:30.300> exact<00:04:31.050> around<00:04:31.380> the<00:04:31.470> corners

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:31.850 
hundred percent exact around the corners

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:40.350 
hundred percent exact around the corners
but<00:04:32.850> besides<00:04:33.000> that<00:04:33.380> it's<00:04:34.380> quite<00:04:34.530> nice

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:40.360 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:42.839 

it<00:04:40.900> does<00:04:41.080> have<00:04:41.229> a<00:04:41.259> little<00:04:41.620> it<00:04:42.189> doesnt<00:04:42.490> sit<00:04:42.610> flat

00:04:42.839 --> 00:04:42.849 
it does have a little it doesnt sit flat

00:04:42.849 --> 00:04:45.029 
it does have a little it doesnt sit flat
on<00:04:43.000> the<00:04:43.060> bottom<00:04:43.210> either<00:04:43.479> so<00:04:43.900> we're<00:04:44.860> going<00:04:44.949> to

00:04:45.029 --> 00:04:45.039 
on the bottom either so we're going to

00:04:45.039 --> 00:04:46.320 
on the bottom either so we're going to
have<00:04:45.069> to<00:04:45.250> hold<00:04:45.430> on<00:04:45.550> to<00:04:45.699> the<00:04:45.819> little<00:04:46.030> and<00:04:46.120> groove

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:46.330 
have to hold on to the little and groove

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:52.469 
have to hold on to the little and groove
or<00:04:46.539> you<00:04:46.599> can<00:04:46.750> either<00:04:46.870> do<00:04:47.050> it<00:04:47.080> this<00:04:47.259> way<00:04:51.479> so

00:04:52.469 --> 00:04:52.479 
or you can either do it this way so

00:04:52.479 --> 00:04:54.869 
or you can either do it this way so
let's<00:04:52.719> have<00:04:52.900> a<00:04:52.960> little<00:04:53.520> that's<00:04:54.520> not<00:04:54.699> really

00:04:54.869 --> 00:04:54.879 
let's have a little that's not really

00:04:54.879 --> 00:04:58.670 
let's have a little that's not really
that<00:04:54.909> big<00:04:55.120> of<00:04:55.150> a<00:04:55.270> deal

00:04:58.670 --> 00:04:58.680 

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:02.240
