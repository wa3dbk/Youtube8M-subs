00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:04.730
 we are in a time of player changes 

00:00:02.989 --> 00:00:06.590
 of reinforcements for different equipment 

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:07.940
 football and a very recruitment 

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:09.590
 interesting is that of Carlos Emilio 

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:11.480
 orrantia who goes to the team of saints of 

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:13.309
 the lagoon region thank you for being in 

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:15.410
 exclusive for some sports I do not control 

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:17.030
 thanks to you dear carlos emilio 

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:18.590
 what do you think about this change that 

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:19.820
 it occurs in your career after you shine 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:20.779
 with the team the cougars and being 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:23.690
 constants with the devils of toluca 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:27.410
 well I think they are the two things are 

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:32.029
 new goals are the new airs not that 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:33.320
 one always encourages us to take new ones 

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:34.760
 circumstances but I think that see 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:37.190
 pretty good is a great team with a 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:38.899
 great technician and this to win big 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:40.309
 things as they warn you that you would spend the 

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:43.280
 team of santos lagoon after 

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:45.230
 as their holders in the cup tournament 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:47.690
 and it also becomes stellar in the 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:50.570
 liguilla de toluca if I'm in 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:53.860
 competitions knew nothing and already when 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:56.149
 but unfortunately we are disqualified 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:57.320
 receive several calls from the 

00:00:56.149 --> 00:00:59.840
 directive by the 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:01.489
 representatives and in the end we decided 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:03.260
 a very good option very good team and 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:03.860
 then we do not come with big 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.020
 aspirations 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:07.220
 emilio one thing is a popular team to 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:09.260
 national level and other 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:10.640
 big team occasions that saints and 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:13.070
 Toluca are great football teams 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.420
 Mexican Toluca is historically great 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:16.010
 I do not think that saints are doing well 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:19.250
 things lately is a team that 

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:20.630
 always is protagonist in the liguillas 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:23.750
 he's always fighting he's got 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:25.340
 titles in recent years and is for 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:27.560
 great things we are here to add and 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:29.480
 to be able to do even bigger what 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:31.580
 it's how you find at the local level 

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:32.690
 regional the requirement that the public that 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:35.720
 the media give the team the 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:37.760
 well , we have not been given the 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:38.930
 I welcome you quite well but I think 

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:40.400
 that everything can change with you 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:41.960
 competition not we all here for 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:45.170
 that people have fun to give 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:48.200
 joy every every match so that 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:49.850
 Enjoy the weekends but very 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:51.740
 well very good wave the people of the 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:53.840
 comarca lagunera and in the first days 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:55.580
 who has felt or how the being changes 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:57.440
 directed by our old 'sticky 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:59.690
 continent ' bring different ideas to me 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:01.970
 it seems clear, but I work very well 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:05.330
 have different ideas to what has 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:07.820
 touched having in my previous years but 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:10.670
 I think those are videos 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:12.560
 dynamic very team very fast very 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:14.120
 powerful that concrete the plays and 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:15.440
 always go for more than you think 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:17.660
 the reinforcements that have been integrated into 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:18.709
 team this on the waterfront and thing also you 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:19.910
 you know it well from the team of 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:22.940
 red devils of toluca 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:24.620
 I continue with them I have touched with the coast 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:26.450
 I was the whole tournament past the two 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:28.670
 tournaments and that already known by the 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:30.500
 world sub20 really are good 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:32.990
 players with great contributions and 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:34.100
 the Argentines just arrived, I think 

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:35.540
 that also come to add with 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:37.280
 great qualities to be able to make a 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:38.990
 strongest team were your rivals now 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:41.209
 be your fellow elements of the 

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:42.830
 America that the mills and that Mendoza 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:44.360
 emerged in that quarry keyboard 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:46.940
 congratulate them first for the 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:48.170
 championship but good to enjoy the 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:49.700
 moment that has to víctor and when it 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:52.300
 present to want to renew again 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:54.890
 goals to renew the aspiration to renew 

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:56.480
 things to be able to get back a 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:58.250
 title with sanz emilio that has 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:59.360
 like your career as a soccer player 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:01.160
 it was very good on the pumas team 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:03.440
 of the unam arrives that Mexican team 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:05.150
 sub-20 category and enduro that I can 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:06.440
 We said the cup was for Carlos Emilio 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:07.430
 Orrantia were always in training 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:10.489
 extra 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:12.349
 and I say I'm good at the personal thing I think 

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:14.120
 that this I can get to give more 

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:16.730
 I want to consecrate the player to me 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:18.349
 holder all matches if I had to 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:20.180
 continue with puma the 

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:21.590
 championship told of selections 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:23.930
 the national whole world 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:26.599
 Pan American from there I've 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:29.389
 I tried to consecrate everything to get a 

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:30.500
 ownership be constant because good 

00:03:29.389 --> 00:03:32.480
 the decisions of each 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:34.639
 technical no but I had to enter from 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:36.889
 change to be things well and today arrived 

00:03:34.639 --> 00:03:38.480
 with the goal with the goal of being 

00:03:36.889 --> 00:03:39.680
 holder for nothing for this team 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:41.540
 emilio with this opinion of a goalkeeper 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:43.280
 as oswaldo sánchez that in many 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:45.590
 we thought he would continue his career as 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:47.359
 as a goalkeeper he has talent and he's in 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:50.030
 great level but I do not know its withdrawal from 

00:03:47.359 --> 00:03:51.769
 Mexican football and good is pitiful 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:55.669
 when big players announce their 

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:57.169
 retirement but it's also admire all the 

00:03:55.669 --> 00:03:58.400
 sports career that had the good 

00:03:57.169 --> 00:04:01.010

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:02.389
 got the truth who saint is

00:04:02.389 --> 00:04:06.530

00:04:04.909 --> 00:04:08.930
 well in what follows his career likes 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:10.310
 the stadium the stadium crowns in all the 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:11.930
 saints territory model is 

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:14.110

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:17.650

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:29.050
 you have to continue developing you as 

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:31.390
 person and as a player the truth I believe 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:34.030
 which is a plus and that will invite us to 

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:35.260
