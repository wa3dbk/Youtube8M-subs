00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:13.320 
this is the only color there is as far

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:14.990 
this is the only color there is as far
as<00:02:13.440> I<00:02:13.500> know<00:02:13.560> right<00:02:13.710> now<00:02:13.890> I<00:02:14.310> wanted<00:02:14.670> to<00:02:14.820> read<00:02:14.970> one

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
as I know right now I wanted to read one

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.710 
as I know right now I wanted to read one
button<00:02:15.510> I<00:02:16.010> like<00:02:17.010> the<00:02:17.130> look<00:02:17.280> of<00:02:17.370> this<00:02:17.520> though<00:02:17.730> so

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
button I like the look of this though so

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:22.010 
button I like the look of this though so
you've<00:02:18.900> got<00:02:19.110> your<00:02:19.910> lan<00:02:20.910> cable<00:02:21.240> connector

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:22.020 
you've got your lan cable connector

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:26.000 
you've got your lan cable connector
there<00:02:22.230> this<00:02:22.440> is<00:02:22.620> for<00:02:22.800> the<00:02:22.890> power<00:02:23.100> HDMI<00:02:24.350> USB<00:02:25.350> I

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
there this is for the power HDMI USB I

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:29.300 
there this is for the power HDMI USB I
guess<00:02:26.340> that's<00:02:26.550> to<00:02:26.730> sync<00:02:26.970> the<00:02:27.890> the<00:02:28.890> dual<00:02:29.070> the

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
guess that's to sync the the dual the

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:31.940 
guess that's to sync the the dual the
controller<00:02:29.670> and<00:02:30.060> then<00:02:30.600> this<00:02:30.810> is<00:02:30.960> to<00:02:31.590> put<00:02:31.800> in

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
controller and then this is to put in

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:36.320 
controller and then this is to put in
your<00:02:33.500> memory<00:02:34.500> card<00:02:34.830> you've<00:02:35.700> got<00:02:35.880> games<00:02:36.090> on

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 
your memory card you've got games on

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:38.360 
your memory card you've got games on
that<00:02:36.510> or<00:02:36.690> if<00:02:36.750> you<00:02:36.930> for<00:02:37.260> your<00:02:37.380> save<00:02:37.620> data<00:02:37.890> and

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
that or if you for your save data and

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:41.420 
that or if you for your save data and
then<00:02:38.910> the<00:02:39.060> Vita<00:02:39.330> games<00:02:39.540> I<00:02:40.010> never<00:02:41.010> understood

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
then the Vita games I never understood

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:46.730 
then the Vita games I never understood
why<00:02:41.610> they<00:02:41.760> do<00:02:41.820> this<00:02:43.850> let's<00:02:44.850> see<00:02:44.970> here<00:02:45.590> see<00:02:46.590> if<00:02:46.680> I

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:46.740 
why they do this let's see here see if I

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:48.350 
why they do this let's see here see if I
can<00:02:46.860> break<00:02:47.040> it<00:02:47.190> after<00:02:47.400> I<00:02:47.459> just<00:02:47.640> got<00:02:47.700> it<00:02:47.970> yeah

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 
can break it after I just got it yeah

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.600 
can break it after I just got it yeah
probably<00:02:48.690> I<00:02:48.870> can<00:02:49.140> I<00:02:49.380> can<00:02:50.220> figure<00:02:50.340> out<00:02:50.489> how<00:02:50.550> to

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
probably I can I can figure out how to

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:52.340 
probably I can I can figure out how to
get<00:02:50.730> it<00:02:50.850> open<00:02:50.910> there<00:02:51.180> we<00:02:51.239> go<00:02:51.390> I<00:02:51.600> don't<00:02:52.260> like

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:52.350 
get it open there we go I don't like

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:53.780 
get it open there we go I don't like
these<00:02:52.530> kind<00:02:52.770> of<00:02:52.800> things<00:02:53.010> but<00:02:53.190> whatever<00:02:53.520> I'll

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
these kind of things but whatever I'll

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:55.520 
these kind of things but whatever I'll
get<00:02:53.940> over<00:02:54.060> it<00:02:54.209> and<00:02:54.540> that's<00:02:55.080> where<00:02:55.290> the<00:02:55.350> game

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
get over it and that's where the game

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:59.300 
get over it and that's where the game
itself<00:02:55.830> goes<00:02:56.100> so<00:02:57.410> what<00:02:58.410> should<00:02:58.560> I<00:02:58.680> play<00:02:58.739> first

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
itself goes so what should I play first

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:01.990 
itself goes so what should I play first
on<00:02:59.550> the<00:02:59.670> big<00:02:59.820> screen<00:03:00.120> that's<00:03:00.330> the<00:03:00.480> question<00:03:00.810> I

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:02.000 
on the big screen that's the question I

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.430 
on the big screen that's the question I
think<00:03:03.000> the<00:03:03.330> plan<00:03:03.540> is<00:03:03.600> is<00:03:03.959> to<00:03:03.989> make<00:03:04.140> this

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440 
think the plan is is to make this

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.199 
think the plan is is to make this
compatible<00:03:05.190> with<00:03:05.340> the<00:03:05.459> PlayStation<00:03:05.700> 4

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:06.209 
compatible with the PlayStation 4

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:07.720 
compatible with the PlayStation 4
controller<00:03:06.360> so<00:03:06.780> that<00:03:06.840> there's<00:03:07.110> kind<00:03:07.440> of<00:03:07.500> more

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:07.730 
controller so that there's kind of more

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:09.740 
controller so that there's kind of more
touchscreen<00:03:08.730> II<00:03:08.760> type<00:03:09.030> stuff<00:03:09.330> that<00:03:09.360> you<00:03:09.570> can

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
touchscreen II type stuff that you can

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:14.750 
touchscreen II type stuff that you can
do<00:03:12.170> but<00:03:13.170> at<00:03:13.350> the<00:03:13.470> moment<00:03:13.650> I<00:03:14.070> think<00:03:14.280> some<00:03:14.610> of<00:03:14.640> the

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
do but at the moment I think some of the

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:16.400 
do but at the moment I think some of the
games<00:03:14.970> won't<00:03:15.120> work<00:03:15.239> very<00:03:15.630> well<00:03:15.690> like<00:03:15.959> I<00:03:16.200> said<00:03:16.380> I

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:16.410 
games won't work very well like I said I

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:17.660 
games won't work very well like I said I
don't<00:03:16.530> know<00:03:16.739> I've<00:03:16.890> just<00:03:17.070> got<00:03:17.250> it<00:03:17.430> I've<00:03:17.610> just

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:17.670 
don't know I've just got it I've just

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:23.000 
don't know I've just got it I've just
gotten<00:03:18.120> it<00:03:18.239> so<00:03:18.420> have<00:03:18.600> to<00:03:18.830> try<00:03:19.830> it<00:03:19.920> out<00:03:22.010> but

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.010 
gotten it so have to try it out but

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:24.650 
gotten it so have to try it out but
nothing<00:03:23.340> else<00:03:23.459> in<00:03:23.610> this<00:03:23.700> box<00:03:24.000> I<00:03:24.209> think<00:03:24.420> will<00:03:24.540> be

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:24.660 
nothing else in this box I think will be

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:34.930 
nothing else in this box I think will be
very<00:03:24.989> interesting<00:03:30.709> alright<00:03:32.420> here's<00:03:33.420> the
