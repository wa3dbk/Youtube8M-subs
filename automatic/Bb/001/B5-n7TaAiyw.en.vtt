hi<00:00:00.570> I'm<00:00:00.989> Karen<00:00:01.469> for<00:00:01.620> expert<00:00:01.740> village<00:00:02.490> and<00:00:02.929> then

00:00:03.919 --> 00:00:03.929 
hi I'm Karen for expert village and then

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:08.230 
hi I'm Karen for expert village and then
I'm<00:00:04.110> going<00:00:04.200> to<00:00:04.290> just<00:00:04.529> cut<00:00:04.770> along<00:00:05.130> those<00:00:05.430> lines

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:08.240 

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:15.589 

one<00:00:11.090> this<00:00:12.090> section<00:00:12.630> will<00:00:12.660> remove<00:00:13.230> and<00:00:14.599> this

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
one this section will remove and this

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:18.830 
one this section will remove and this
section<00:00:16.049> we<00:00:16.170> will<00:00:16.199> not<00:00:16.529> remove<00:00:17.240> so<00:00:18.240> just<00:00:18.539> cut

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
section we will not remove so just cut

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.279 
section we will not remove so just cut
right<00:00:19.020> along<00:00:19.260> those<00:00:19.650> lines<00:00:19.980> like<00:00:20.279> that<00:00:21.289> okay

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
right along those lines like that okay

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:23.810 
right along those lines like that okay
now<00:00:22.800> we'll<00:00:22.949> just<00:00:23.010> do<00:00:23.310> a<00:00:23.340> little<00:00:23.519> bit<00:00:23.789> of

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
now we'll just do a little bit of

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.880 
now we'll just do a little bit of
folding<00:00:24.560> you<00:00:25.560> want<00:00:25.769> to<00:00:25.920> fold<00:00:26.400> down<00:00:26.699> this<00:00:27.000> flap

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:27.890 
folding you want to fold down this flap

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:32.030 
folding you want to fold down this flap
like<00:00:28.890> so<00:00:29.400> fold<00:00:30.179> it<00:00:30.359> that<00:00:30.539> way<00:00:30.779> and<00:00:31.050> then<00:00:31.619> fold

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
like so fold it that way and then fold

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.360 
like so fold it that way and then fold
it<00:00:32.279> the<00:00:32.579> opposite<00:00:33.120> way<00:00:33.710> like<00:00:34.710> that<00:00:34.980> so<00:00:35.280> you

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
it the opposite way like that so you

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.290 
it the opposite way like that so you
have<00:00:35.579> something<00:00:36.090> that<00:00:36.239> looks<00:00:36.570> like<00:00:36.660> that<00:00:38.300> then

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
have something that looks like that then

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:45.220 
have something that looks like that then
we'll<00:00:40.140> fold<00:00:40.559> this<00:00:41.370> section<00:00:42.829> diagonally<00:00:43.829> up

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:45.230 
we'll fold this section diagonally up

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:48.979 
we'll fold this section diagonally up
like<00:00:46.230> that<00:00:46.879> so<00:00:47.879> it<00:00:48.059> goes<00:00:48.239> pretty<00:00:48.629> much

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
like that so it goes pretty much

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.529 
like that so it goes pretty much
straight<00:00:49.410> and<00:00:49.590> even<00:00:49.770> and<00:00:50.100> flip<00:00:51.000> it<00:00:51.120> over<00:00:51.300> and

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
straight and even and flip it over and

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:56.389 
straight and even and flip it over and
do<00:00:51.960> the<00:00:52.110> same<00:00:52.410> on<00:00:52.710> the<00:00:52.949> other<00:00:52.980> side<00:00:54.739> it<00:00:55.739> looks<00:00:56.219> a

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
do the same on the other side it looks a

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.299 
do the same on the other side it looks a
little<00:00:56.550> strange<00:00:56.760> but<00:00:57.270> you'll<00:00:57.449> see<00:00:58.100> how<00:00:59.100> it

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
little strange but you'll see how it

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.040 
little strange but you'll see how it
works<00:00:59.609> in<00:00:59.879> the<00:01:00.000> end<00:01:00.090> now<00:01:00.660> you're<00:01:00.840> going<00:01:00.989> to

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
works in the end now you're going to

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:06.830 
works in the end now you're going to
fold<00:01:01.079> up<00:01:02.120> these<00:01:03.120> bottom<00:01:05.330> triangles<00:01:06.330> like<00:01:06.540> that

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
fold up these bottom triangles like that

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.620 
fold up these bottom triangles like that
flip<00:01:07.799> it<00:01:07.920> over<00:01:08.189> and<00:01:08.580> do<00:01:08.850> the<00:01:09.000> same<00:01:09.270> on<00:01:09.299> this

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
flip it over and do the same on this

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:15.920 
flip it over and do the same on this
side<00:01:11.360> folding<00:01:12.360> it<00:01:12.510> up<00:01:12.659> and<00:01:13.850> then<00:01:14.850> the<00:01:15.750> last

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
side folding it up and then the last

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.719 
side folding it up and then the last
fold<00:01:16.560> we're<00:01:17.490> going<00:01:17.850> to<00:01:18.180> fold<00:01:19.159> the<00:01:20.159> triangles

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
fold we're going to fold the triangles

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.820 
fold we're going to fold the triangles
into<00:01:21.090> the<00:01:21.210> center<00:01:21.509> so<00:01:21.630> we<00:01:21.659> open<00:01:22.140> up<00:01:22.320> the<00:01:22.380> plane

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
into the center so we open up the plane

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:27.170 
into the center so we open up the plane
a<00:01:22.860> little<00:01:23.250> bit<00:01:23.400> there<00:01:23.700> and<00:01:24.740> fold<00:01:25.740> in<00:01:26.180> these

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
a little bit there and fold in these

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.080 
a little bit there and fold in these
sections<00:01:27.450> so<00:01:28.259> what<00:01:28.740> this<00:01:28.950> does<00:01:29.310> is<00:01:29.549> it<00:01:29.700> makes<00:01:29.729> a

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
sections so what this does is it makes a

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.010 
sections so what this does is it makes a
nice<00:01:30.270> heavy<00:01:31.130> front<00:01:32.130> for<00:01:32.460> the<00:01:32.490> plane<00:01:32.909> and<00:01:33.240> that

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
nice heavy front for the plane and that

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.410 
nice heavy front for the plane and that
will<00:01:34.170> help<00:01:34.350> propel<00:01:35.009> it<00:01:35.189> through<00:01:35.490> the<00:01:35.579> air<00:01:35.700> now

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
will help propel it through the air now

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.550 
will help propel it through the air now
just<00:01:36.720> take<00:01:36.900> one<00:01:37.229> small<00:01:37.619> bit<00:01:38.040> of<00:01:38.070> tape<00:01:38.549> and

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:39.560 
just take one small bit of tape and

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:45.020 
just take one small bit of tape and
we'll<00:01:40.560> tape<00:01:40.920> the<00:01:41.280> nose<00:01:43.070> closed<00:01:44.070> just<00:01:44.759> one

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
we'll tape the nose closed just one

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:49.340 
we'll tape the nose closed just one
piece<00:01:45.270> of<00:01:45.479> tape<00:01:45.750> right<00:01:46.280> across<00:01:47.899> the<00:01:48.899> nose<00:01:49.170> of

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
piece of tape right across the nose of

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.670 
piece of tape right across the nose of
the<00:01:49.439> plane<00:01:49.590> now<00:01:50.040> to<00:01:50.909> fly<00:01:51.329> this<00:01:51.390> plane<00:01:51.680> you're

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
the plane now to fly this plane you're

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.679 
the plane now to fly this plane you're
just<00:01:52.860> going<00:01:53.100> to<00:01:53.159> fold<00:01:53.430> the<00:01:53.670> wings<00:01:53.850> down<00:01:54.299> like

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
just going to fold the wings down like

00:01:54.689 --> 00:02:00.730 
just going to fold the wings down like
this<00:01:57.560> and<00:01:58.560> it<00:01:58.740> flies<00:01:59.070> very<00:01:59.399> nicely<00:01:59.850> and<00:02:00.420> you

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:00.740 
this and it flies very nicely and you

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:04.219 
this and it flies very nicely and you
can<00:02:01.740> send<00:02:02.070> it<00:02:02.219> in<00:02:02.369> the<00:02:02.430> mail<00:02:02.670> flat<00:02:03.540> like<00:02:03.960> this

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
can send it in the mail flat like this

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:10.580 
can send it in the mail flat like this
and<00:02:05.719> just<00:02:06.719> tell<00:02:07.020> them<00:02:07.140> to<00:02:08.840> fold<00:02:09.840> that<00:02:10.020> down<00:02:10.080> and

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
and just tell them to fold that down and

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:14.010 
and just tell them to fold that down and
we're<00:02:10.739> ready<00:02:10.920> to<00:02:11.039> fly

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:14.020 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:16.510 

that's<00:02:15.020> a<00:02:15.140> nice<00:02:15.319> little<00:02:15.500> toy<00:02:15.800> to<00:02:16.069> send<00:02:16.280> through

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:16.520 
that's a nice little toy to send through

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:18.640 
that's a nice little toy to send through
the<00:02:16.550> mail
