00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:47.560 
but basically I'm just going to squirt

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:52.499 
but basically I'm just going to squirt
out<00:01:47.740> both<00:01:48.009> sides<00:01:50.430> equally<00:01:51.430> into<00:01:51.850> this<00:01:52.329> is

00:01:52.499 --> 00:01:52.509 
out both sides equally into this is

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:55.139 
out both sides equally into this is
actually<00:01:52.840> just<00:01:53.020> the<00:01:53.140> container<00:01:53.649> that<00:01:54.149> the

00:01:55.139 --> 00:01:55.149
