00:03:20.259 --> 00:03:20.269 
make sure if you're going to reintroduce

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:22.179 
make sure if you're going to reintroduce
the<00:03:20.689> species<00:03:21.200> you<00:03:21.319> reintroduce<00:03:21.650> the<00:03:22.010> right

00:03:22.179 --> 00:03:22.189 
the species you reintroduce the right

00:03:22.189 --> 00:03:23.920 
the species you reintroduce the right
ones<00:03:22.459> in<00:03:22.640> the<00:03:22.700> right<00:03:22.849> numbers<00:03:23.269> because<00:03:23.629> if<00:03:23.780> the

ones in the right numbers because if the
ratio<00:03:24.079> is<00:03:24.439> off<00:03:24.590> whatsoever<00:03:25.280> then<00:03:25.549> the<00:03:25.670> food

00:03:25.839 --> 00:03:25.849 
ratio is off whatsoever then the food

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:27.440 
chains delicate balance is going to be

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:29.170 
chains delicate balance is going to be
thrown<00:03:27.739> off<00:03:27.859> and<00:03:28.609> it's<00:03:28.760> very<00:03:28.879> very<00:03:28.970> possible

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:29.180 
thrown off and it's very very possible

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:31.270 
thrown off and it's very very possible
to<00:03:29.659> recover<00:03:29.930> from<00:03:30.079> so<00:03:30.769> it's<00:03:30.920> all<00:03:31.040> very

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:31.280 
to recover from so it's all very

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:33.369 
to recover from so it's all very
dependent<00:03:31.909> on<00:03:32.060> whether<00:03:32.299> you<00:03:32.450> get<00:03:33.109> the<00:03:33.230> number

00:03:33.369 --> 00:03:33.379 
dependent on whether you get the number

00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:35.289 
dependent on whether you get the number
of<00:03:33.650> species<00:03:33.889> reintroduce<00:03:34.579> right<00:03:34.879> I<00:03:34.909> mean<00:03:35.150> it's

00:03:35.289 --> 00:03:35.299 
of species reintroduce right I mean it's

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:36.759 
of species reintroduce right I mean it's
the<00:03:35.389> same<00:03:35.629> question<00:03:35.840> then<00:03:36.319> people<00:03:36.620> wonder

00:03:36.759 --> 00:03:36.769 
the same question then people wonder

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:38.979 
the same question then people wonder
when<00:03:37.159> you<00:03:37.340> shouldn't<00:03:37.730> should<00:03:38.450> we<00:03:38.569> reintroduce

00:03:38.979 --> 00:03:38.989 
when you shouldn't should we reintroduce

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:40.990 
when you shouldn't should we reintroduce
