00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:24.060 
really say if that would take care of it
but<00:02:21.850> that's<00:02:21.940> what<00:02:22.209> they<00:02:22.390> could<00:02:22.570> find<00:02:22.780> I<00:02:23.170> have

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:24.070 
but that's what they could find I have

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:27.150 
but that's what they could find I have
driven<00:02:24.370> the<00:02:24.790> van<00:02:24.820> last<00:02:25.540> night<00:02:25.870> and<00:02:26.260> this

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:27.160 
driven the van last night and this

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:30.449 
driven the van last night and this
morning<00:02:27.220> and<00:02:27.989> it<00:02:28.989> stalled<00:02:29.410> on<00:02:29.650> me<00:02:29.830> once<00:02:30.100> when<00:02:30.430> I

00:02:30.449 --> 00:02:30.459 
morning and it stalled on me once when I

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:32.580 
morning and it stalled on me once when I
first<00:02:30.820> left<00:02:31.060> the<00:02:31.300> shop<00:02:31.540> I<00:02:31.870> don't<00:02:32.140> know<00:02:32.230> if<00:02:32.380> that

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
first left the shop I don't know if that

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:34.770 
first left the shop I don't know if that
was<00:02:32.770> just<00:02:32.800> kind<00:02:33.250> of<00:02:33.340> random<00:02:33.880> but<00:02:34.480> it<00:02:34.600> really

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:34.780 
was just kind of random but it really

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:37.290 
was just kind of random but it really
hasn't<00:02:35.080> done<00:02:35.320> anything<00:02:35.739> since<00:02:36.280> and<00:02:36.730> it's<00:02:37.060> been

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:37.300 
hasn't done anything since and it's been

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:40.199 
hasn't done anything since and it's been
running<00:02:37.510> pretty<00:02:37.780> good<00:02:38.010> so<00:02:39.010> I<00:02:39.459> don't<00:02:39.970> want<00:02:40.120> to

00:02:40.199 --> 00:02:40.209 
running pretty good so I don't want to

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:42.210 
running pretty good so I don't want to
jinx<00:02:40.420> it<00:02:40.660> and<00:02:40.810> say<00:02:40.959> it's<00:02:41.140> fixed<00:02:41.620> but<00:02:41.830> I<00:02:41.860> feel

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:42.220 
jinx it and say it's fixed but I feel

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:44.670 
jinx it and say it's fixed but I feel
like<00:02:42.459> whatever<00:02:43.000> they<00:02:43.180> did<00:02:43.450> that<00:02:43.840> that<00:02:44.200> vacuum

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680 
like whatever they did that that vacuum

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:47.670 
like whatever they did that that vacuum
line<00:02:44.890> did<00:02:45.190> fix<00:02:45.459> something<00:02:46.290> I'm<00:02:47.290> kind<00:02:47.560> of

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.680 
line did fix something I'm kind of

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:49.650 
line did fix something I'm kind of
feeling<00:02:48.010> like<00:02:48.040> I<00:02:48.310> had<00:02:48.489> maybe<00:02:48.700> multiple<00:02:49.030> issues

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:49.660 
feeling like I had maybe multiple issues

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:52.259 
feeling like I had maybe multiple issues
so<00:02:50.470> yeah<00:02:51.310> I'm<00:02:51.400> gonna<00:02:51.519> just<00:02:51.730> keep<00:02:51.910> driving

00:02:52.259 --> 00:02:52.269 
so yeah I'm gonna just keep driving

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:54.090 
so yeah I'm gonna just keep driving
around<00:02:52.540> guys<00:02:52.810> and<00:02:53.080> I'll<00:02:53.170> keep<00:02:53.350> you<00:02:53.470> posted<00:02:53.500> but

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:56.070 
around guys and I'll keep you posted but
it<00:02:54.190> sounds<00:02:54.580> like<00:02:54.610> between<00:02:55.269> the<00:02:55.450> crank<00:02:55.780> sensor

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:56.080 
it sounds like between the crank sensor

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:59.009 
it sounds like between the crank sensor
that<00:02:56.470> they<00:02:56.620> replaced<00:02:57.040> and<00:02:57.400> this<00:02:58.300> vacuum<00:02:58.570> line

00:02:59.009 --> 00:02:59.019 
that they replaced and this vacuum line

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:00.600 
that they replaced and this vacuum line
that<00:02:59.260> was<00:02:59.380> going<00:02:59.739> to<00:02:59.890> the<00:03:00.010> mass<00:03:00.220> airflow

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:00.610 
that was going to the mass airflow

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:04.560 
that was going to the mass airflow
sensor<00:03:01.500> it<00:03:02.500> seems<00:03:02.920> like<00:03:03.190> it<00:03:03.370> it's<00:03:03.610> resolved

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:04.570 
sensor it seems like it it's resolved

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:08.220 
sensor it seems like it it's resolved
the<00:03:05.340> kind<00:03:06.340> of<00:03:06.459> choking<00:03:06.790> up<00:03:07.180> and<00:03:07.480> dying<00:03:07.810> on<00:03:08.050> me
