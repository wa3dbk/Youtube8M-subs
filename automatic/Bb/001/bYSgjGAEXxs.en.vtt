00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
food and all that I figure I might as

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.109 
food and all that I figure I might as
well<00:01:33.390> do<00:01:33.900> something<00:01:34.280> along<00:01:35.280> the<00:01:35.460> line<00:01:35.610> so<00:01:35.939> let

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
well do something along the line so let

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:37.819 
well do something along the line so let
the<00:01:36.240> economy<00:01:36.720> continue<00:01:37.110> to<00:01:37.200> recover<00:01:37.500> and

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
the economy continue to recover and

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:39.920 
the economy continue to recover and
hopefully<00:01:38.280> make<00:01:38.759> more<00:01:39.060> and<00:01:39.210> more<00:01:39.270> connections

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
hopefully make more and more connections

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:41.420 
hopefully make more and more connections
as<00:01:40.110> I<00:01:40.229> go<00:01:40.380> the<00:01:40.560> longer<00:01:40.890> I'm<00:01:40.950> here<00:01:40.979> the<00:01:41.250> more

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
as I go the longer I'm here the more

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:42.889 
as I go the longer I'm here the more
connections<00:01:41.939> I<00:01:42.060> make<00:01:42.270> and<00:01:42.450> I'm<00:01:42.540> hoping<00:01:42.840> that

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
connections I make and I'm hoping that

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:44.780 
connections I make and I'm hoping that
will<00:01:43.170> sort<00:01:43.799> of<00:01:43.920> translate<00:01:44.250> out<00:01:44.520> into<00:01:44.670> my

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
will sort of translate out into my
