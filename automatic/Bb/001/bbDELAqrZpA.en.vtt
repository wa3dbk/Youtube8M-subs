00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:07.560
 i'm sitting with you if you medici you and he is wedding photographer 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.340
 And then you take pictures during child marriage and it is a nuisance 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:12.289
 maybe it 

00:00:12.289 --> 00:00:13.859
 most important 

00:00:13.859 --> 00:00:16.560
 tradition for an indoor is an army 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.409
 but a continuing weather in the sky 

00:00:18.409 --> 00:00:21.570
 Now it is a very beautiful sight to see 

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:25.949
 a lot of things are involved and these people are sure we are up 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:29.560
 a nicest lot of preparation you just see back in front of people lived 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:32.920
 half year or boots have been 9mb 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:37.130
 you see anp a spicy cultural aspect and the beautiful is not the reason 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.200
 and of course also very nice photo opportunities 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.230
 he now we are very many traditions and rituals during such in the air 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:47.110
 how do you know how to put your feet but it is a concert hall there are according to 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:50.570
 me yes that's right in the beginning it was therefore difficult because you just have whole 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:53.400
 many moments and many important moments too 

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:56.640
 sometimes several moments come at the same time but it just becomes very difficult 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.640
 is to choose again from you what you are not stuck 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:03.980
 in the beginning i had to gather information at various point nothing to me 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:07.050
 just right she went again that's important that's important is too 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:07.620
 put 

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:10.550
 is correct in a crisis 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:15.640
 and yes ultimately rea by experiences there it actually goes naturally now 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:16.900
 what's your 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:20.790
 photo moment from when you go to a wedding it you know from after that 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.040
 the moment I want to capture tightly, there is one 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.290
 no no specific that may differ per July 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:30.840
 and yes you have so much currently at csi says van dijk that i really want to capture 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.000
 as a result, not talking to a yes specific moment 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.150
 if you like your photography then this is the square 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:41.060
 very much for a lantern I see a photo shoot there she can grab yuko 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:44.720
 of the lens and with this you make something that is really very small, actually very large 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:49.380
 photos yes that's right with this I did he highlight details such as afterwards 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:50.760
 on the road 

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:52.080
 on one hand 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:57.940
 there is often a lot of attention and which is taken care of and a lot on the photo 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:01.360
 see that back via displayed photo I have seen a great deal with 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:06.310
 such a small boxes though why tiresome powder goes through in the 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:06.720
 holes 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:07.939
 the fight that is photo 

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:11.640
 years often you see on an overview of cars if you look closely then you see 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.249
 seen through 

00:02:13.249 --> 00:02:16.829
 because you do not look carefully whether you now have a real wide angle picture could be me so 

00:02:16.829 --> 00:02:19.199
 it could also be something else 

00:02:19.199 --> 00:02:20.929
 chain ring 

00:02:20.929 --> 00:02:24.689
 and by taking office photo it is just very clear to see what 

00:02:24.689 --> 00:02:28.129
 It is precise because it is an important tradition to have the red 

00:02:28.129 --> 00:02:28.719
 pencil 

00:02:28.719 --> 00:02:30.729
 to divorce the woman 

00:02:30.729 --> 00:02:34.249
 absolutely that is perhaps one of the most important tradition of tom and that 

00:02:34.249 --> 00:02:36.159
 that happened 

00:02:36.159 --> 00:02:39.280
 officially actually married that happened under a cloth you are never 

00:02:39.279 --> 00:02:40.989
 photograph under a cloth 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:44.310
 often distance from me I also learn to hold my camera but 

00:02:45.619 --> 00:02:48.299
 no i do respect him yes 

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:52.170
 now I have told myself that she does know the photo interest 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:55.910
 but you actually do not know exactly what that moment actually is not necessary how come 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:59.090
 it actually as a pretty bad thing to win yes I know a lot 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:03.110
 only the tricky is often very many people of course own 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:05.189
 interpretation also with certain things 

00:03:05.189 --> 00:03:09.510
 their own story i have size to i am a photographer i am not a priest 

00:03:09.509 --> 00:03:12.089
 that knows what to record 

00:03:12.089 --> 00:03:14.580
 I'm not always about everything to know if you m 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:18.560
 for example, that would make sense by putting the powder in the weird or the sieves 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:21.800
 tours stress experience no more important than understanding the 

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:23.979
 tradition thinking 

00:03:23.979 --> 00:03:28.680
 often quite often what if you go for it if you understand everything but one movement 

00:03:28.679 --> 00:03:29.910
 who don't have it 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:32.660
 yes then there were also I think a less van santen would prefer less 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:35.639
 understand and experience more than the value is greater 

00:03:35.639 --> 00:03:38.939
 yes or a combination of both yes 

00:03:38.939 --> 00:03:42.269
 yes now you say that you photograph in a special way and now I am 

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:43.630
 curious or writing that there is 

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:46.790
 and my way of photographing is very difficult to describe 

00:03:47.539 --> 00:03:51.189
 but using the different ways on the one hand I am kind of like that 

00:03:51.189 --> 00:03:53.639
 journalism that keeps an eye on everything 

00:03:53.639 --> 00:03:57.159
 on the other hand, I am a kind of fish, a photographer posing for a human rights council 

00:03:57.159 --> 00:03:58.529
 to take the pictures 

00:03:58.529 --> 00:04:02.289
 and besides that, yes, photography still tries to combine with art 

00:04:03.229 --> 00:04:07.769
 but not so strong that the authenticity is lost that is not 

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:10.409
 understand more or promise that it is no longer what it was 

00:04:10.409 --> 00:04:11.259
 exactly 

00:04:11.259 --> 00:04:15.129
 if people view photos in a few years, they must still be the same 

00:04:15.129 --> 00:04:18.439
 being able to get the same feeling right now is important to me
