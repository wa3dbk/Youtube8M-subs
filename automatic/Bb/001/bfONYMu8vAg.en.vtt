we<00:00:24.029> have<00:00:24.680> there<00:00:25.680> are<00:00:25.710> eight<00:00:25.949> planets<00:00:26.869> can<00:00:27.869> you

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
we have there are eight planets can you

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:30.769 
we have there are eight planets can you
show<00:00:28.199> me<00:00:28.349> the<00:00:28.380> table<00:00:28.800> of<00:00:28.859> the<00:00:28.920> planets<00:00:29.779> here
