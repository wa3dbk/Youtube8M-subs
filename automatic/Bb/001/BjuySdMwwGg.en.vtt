classics<00:00:13.080> what's<00:00:13.650> next<00:00:13.949> I<00:00:14.160> think<00:00:15.059> that's<00:00:15.209> it<00:00:15.270> I

00:00:15.439 --> 00:00:15.449 
classics what's next I think that's it I

00:00:15.449 --> 00:00:18.529 
classics what's next I think that's it I
think<00:00:15.660> you<00:00:15.809> know<00:00:15.900> that<00:00:15.930> we<00:00:16.400> very<00:00:17.400> much<00:00:17.550> looked

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
think you know that we very much looked

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:20.150 
think you know that we very much looked
at<00:00:18.660> a<00:00:18.689> classics<00:00:19.050> first<00:00:19.260> and<00:00:19.410> foremost<00:00:19.770> I<00:00:19.949> think

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
at a classics first and foremost I think

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:21.290 
at a classics first and foremost I think
we<00:00:20.220> haven't<00:00:20.430> really<00:00:20.699> done<00:00:20.789> as<00:00:20.939> well<00:00:21.029> as<00:00:21.150> we'd

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
we haven't really done as well as we'd

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.870 
we haven't really done as well as we'd
like<00:00:21.449> maybe<00:00:21.779> in<00:00:21.960> the<00:00:22.109> one-day<00:00:22.730> races<00:00:23.730> so<00:00:23.849> far

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
like maybe in the one-day races so far

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.880 
like maybe in the one-day races so far
so<00:00:24.390> we<00:00:24.570> took<00:00:25.019> a<00:00:25.079> lot<00:00:25.259> of<00:00:25.289> our<00:00:25.470> learning<00:00:25.800> for

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
so we took a lot of our learning for

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.470 
so we took a lot of our learning for
last<00:00:26.009> couple<00:00:26.249> years<00:00:26.310> and<00:00:26.699> really<00:00:27.119> put<00:00:27.449> a

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
last couple years and really put a

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.179 
last couple years and really put a
specific<00:00:27.929> project<00:00:28.079> in<00:00:28.380> place<00:00:28.589> for<00:00:28.800> a<00:00:28.829> classics

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
in the first instance and then it's on

00:00:37.939 --> 00:00:37.949 
to the Tour de France and of course the

00:00:37.949 --> 00:00:40.790 
to the Tour de France and of course the
races<00:00:38.219> in<00:00:38.340> between<00:00:38.809> so<00:00:39.809> it's<00:00:39.930> it's<00:00:40.440> a<00:00:40.500> big<00:00:40.649> year

for<00:00:40.859> us<00:00:41.039> you<00:00:41.219> know<00:00:41.280> and<00:00:41.489> we've<00:00:42.239> been<00:00:42.420> very

00:00:42.439 --> 00:00:42.449 
for us you know and we've been very

00:00:42.449 --> 00:00:44.540 
for us you know and we've been very
ambitious<00:00:42.930> about<00:00:43.230> it<00:00:43.350> and<00:00:43.800> come<00:00:43.980> one<00:00:44.129> team<00:00:44.340> win

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550

both<00:00:44.789> gol<00:00:45.329> matol<00:00:45.890> there's<00:00:46.890> no<00:00:46.980> reason<00:00:47.190> why<00:00:47.280> not

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
both gol matol there's no reason why not

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.130 
both gol matol there's no reason why not
I<00:00:47.730> think<00:00:47.969> you've<00:00:48.059> got<00:00:48.210> to<00:00:48.359> ride<00:00:48.539> as<00:00:48.660> capable<00:00:48.930> of

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
I think you've got to ride as capable of

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.560 
I think you've got to ride as capable of
doing<00:00:49.410> it<00:00:49.530> then<00:00:49.680> you<00:00:50.190> know<00:00:50.280> that<00:00:50.420> very<00:00:51.420> much

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
doing it then you know that very much

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.689 
doing it then you know that very much
cook<00:00:51.780> so<00:00:52.260> falls<00:00:52.710> back<00:00:52.980> onto<00:00:53.129> the<00:00:53.280> backup<00:00:53.519> team

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
cook so falls back onto the backup team

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.790 
cook so falls back onto the backup team
and<00:00:54.000> do<00:00:54.690> you<00:00:54.750> have<00:00:54.870> the<00:00:54.989> strength<00:00:55.289> in<00:00:55.500> depth

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
and do you have the strength in depth

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.740 
and do you have the strength in depth
and<00:00:56.489> the<00:00:56.550> numbers<00:00:56.910> around<00:00:57.120> as<00:00:57.269> if<00:00:57.390> you<00:00:57.449> like<00:00:57.600> to

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
and the numbers around as if you like to

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.020 
and the numbers around as if you like to
double<00:00:57.870> up<00:00:58.079> and<00:00:58.320> create<00:00:58.589> two<00:00:58.829> Grand<00:00:59.789> Tour

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
double up and create two Grand Tour

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.209 
double up and create two Grand Tour
winning<00:01:00.359> teams<00:01:00.679> and<00:01:01.679> I<00:01:01.739> think<00:01:01.920> that's<00:01:02.039> more

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
winning teams and I think that's more

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.790 
winning teams and I think that's more
than<00:01:02.339> possible<00:01:02.960> we're<00:01:03.960> losing<00:01:04.050> Cavendish

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:04.800 
than possible we're losing Cavendish

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.140 
than possible we're losing Cavendish
affect<00:01:05.100> the<00:01:05.280> overall<00:01:05.339> success<00:01:05.790> of<00:01:06.000> the

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
affect the overall success of the

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.900 
affect the overall success of the
teacups<00:01:06.540> the<00:01:06.660> number<00:01:06.840> of<00:01:06.930> wins<00:01:07.110> but<00:01:07.440> I<00:01:07.910> think

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:08.910 
teacups the number of wins but I think

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:09.980 
teacups the number of wins but I think
you're<00:01:09.000> right<00:01:09.060> i<00:01:09.120> think<00:01:09.330> probably<00:01:09.540> will<00:01:09.810> you

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
you're right i think probably will you

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.230 
you're right i think probably will you
know<00:01:10.079> i<00:01:10.110> think<00:01:10.200> marks<00:01:10.560> prolific<00:01:10.950> winner<00:01:11.180> but<00:01:12.180> i

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
know i think marks prolific winner but i

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.240 
know i think marks prolific winner but i
think<00:01:12.479> really<00:01:12.659> we<00:01:12.869> you<00:01:13.380> know<00:01:13.500> i<00:01:13.530> think<00:01:13.680> having

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
think really we you know i think having

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.609 
think really we you know i think having
having<00:01:15.030> mark<00:01:15.329> move<00:01:15.600> on<00:01:15.810> which<00:01:16.140> is<00:01:16.290> a<00:01:16.320> which<00:01:16.560> is

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
having mark move on which is a which is

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.050 
having mark move on which is a which is
a<00:01:16.770> shame<00:01:16.860> but<00:01:17.310> i<00:01:17.369> think<00:01:17.549> it's<00:01:17.700> quite<00:01:17.820> clear

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
a shame but i think it's quite clear

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.080 
a shame but i think it's quite clear
that<00:01:18.210> we're<00:01:18.780> focusing<00:01:19.530> more<00:01:19.680> on<00:01:19.820> races<00:01:20.820> rather

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
that we're focusing more on races rather

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.350 
that we're focusing more on races rather
than<00:01:21.299> stages<00:01:21.840> and<00:01:22.189> and<00:01:23.189> that's<00:01:23.700> sort<00:01:23.880> of<00:01:24.030> what

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
than stages and and that's sort of what

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.030 
than stages and and that's sort of what
we<00:01:24.509> SAT<00:01:25.170> back<00:01:25.320> and<00:01:25.380> thought<00:01:25.560> about<00:01:25.680> through

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
we SAT back and thought about through

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.560 
we SAT back and thought about through
the<00:01:26.070> winter<00:01:26.430> and<00:01:26.460> that's<00:01:27.119> what<00:01:27.270> we<00:01:27.329> will<00:01:27.420> focus

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570

like<00:01:35.909> it<00:01:36.030> like<00:01:36.240> all<00:01:36.420> teams<00:01:36.689> you<00:01:36.810> know<00:01:36.930> there's

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
like it like all teams you know there's

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.800 
like it like all teams you know there's
a<00:01:37.079> constant<00:01:37.560> turnover<00:01:37.860> of<00:01:38.369> mature<00:01:39.360> riders<00:01:39.719> and

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
a constant turnover of mature riders and

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.929 
a constant turnover of mature riders and
performing<00:01:40.259> riders<00:01:40.590> who<00:01:40.770> will<00:01:41.369> move<00:01:41.549> on<00:01:41.729> and

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
performing riders who will move on and

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:43.190 
performing riders who will move on and
then<00:01:42.119> you<00:01:42.210> have<00:01:42.329> to<00:01:42.450> try<00:01:42.600> and<00:01:42.659> identify<00:01:42.810> the

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
then you have to try and identify the

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.170 
then you have to try and identify the
next<00:01:43.649> up-and-coming<00:01:43.770> riders<00:01:44.490> you<00:01:44.939> know<00:01:45.030> that

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
next up-and-coming riders you know that

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:46.999 
next up-and-coming riders you know that
constant<00:01:45.659> wave<00:01:45.840> if<00:01:46.079> you<00:01:46.200> like<00:01:46.380> a<00:01:46.409> performance

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
constant wave if you like a performance

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:48.920 
constant wave if you like a performance
so<00:01:47.100> we're<00:01:47.219> thinking<00:01:47.549> three<00:01:48.390> to<00:01:48.509> four<00:01:48.689> years

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
so we're thinking three to four years

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.719 
so we're thinking three to four years
ahead<00:01:49.079> in<00:01:49.649> terms<00:01:49.920> of<00:01:50.100> some<00:01:50.250> of<00:01:50.340> the<00:01:50.399> signs<00:01:50.579> that

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
ahead in terms of some of the signs that

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.039 
ahead in terms of some of the signs that
we're<00:01:50.939> making<00:01:51.060> now<00:01:51.390> and<00:01:51.570> trying<00:01:51.719> to<00:01:51.840> develop

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
we're making now and trying to develop

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:53.359 
we're making now and trying to develop
those<00:01:52.289> riders<00:01:52.590> whilst<00:01:52.979> you've<00:01:53.159> got<00:01:53.250> your

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
those riders whilst you've got your

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.999 
those riders whilst you've got your
performing<00:01:53.820> group<00:01:54.030> at<00:01:54.149> a<00:01:54.180> minute<00:01:54.590> so<00:01:55.590> it's<00:01:55.710> a

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
performing group at a minute so it's a

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:57.830 
performing group at a minute so it's a
bit<00:01:56.130> of<00:01:56.159> a<00:01:56.250> juggling<00:01:56.430> act<00:01:56.670> but<00:01:56.939> it's<00:01:57.600> certainly

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
bit of a juggling act but it's certainly

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.200 
bit of a juggling act but it's certainly
a<00:01:58.049> different<00:01:58.770> challenge<00:01:58.950> trying<00:01:59.520> to<00:01:59.670> manage

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
a different challenge trying to manage

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:01.580 
a different challenge trying to manage
the<00:02:00.329> development<00:02:00.780> of<00:02:00.840> riders<00:02:01.229> rather<00:02:01.469> the

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
the development of riders rather the

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.529 
the development of riders rather the
current<00:02:01.859> performing<00:02:02.250> riders<00:02:02.609> there's<00:02:03.450> only

00:02:03.529 --> 00:02:03.539 
current performing riders there's only

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:04.849 
current performing riders there's only
