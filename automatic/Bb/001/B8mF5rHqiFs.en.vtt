00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
that's open but it kind of it looks like

that's open but it kind of it looks like
number<00:01:34.500> six<00:01:34.799> with<00:01:35.130> um<00:01:35.340> with<00:01:35.909> some<00:01:36.299> kind<00:01:36.570> of

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
inside of this kind of emblem i think

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.219 
inside of this kind of emblem i think
it's<00:01:41.460> an<00:01:41.520> octagon<00:01:41.909> on<00:01:42.240> but<00:01:42.810> it<00:01:42.899> has<00:01:42.990> a<00:01:43.020> lot<00:01:43.200> of

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
it's an octagon on but it has a lot of

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.679 
it's an octagon on but it has a lot of
sides<00:01:43.530> to<00:01:43.829> green<00:01:44.040> octagon<00:01:44.490> shape<00:01:44.790> and<00:01:45.030> it<00:01:45.540> has

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
sides to green octagon shape and it has

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.109 
sides to green octagon shape and it has
like<00:01:45.960> i<00:01:46.049> said<00:01:46.229> it's<00:01:46.439> a<00:01:46.560> figure<00:01:46.950> of<00:01:47.130> a<00:01:47.399> six<00:01:47.670> with

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
like i said it's a figure of a six with

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:49.730 
like i said it's a figure of a six with
some<00:01:48.299> barbed<00:01:48.479> wire<00:01:48.659> around<00:01:48.689> it<00:01:49.079> i'm<00:01:49.560> not

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
some barbed wire around it i'm not

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.230 
some barbed wire around it i'm not
really<00:01:49.890> sure<00:01:50.009> about<00:01:50.280> any<00:01:50.520> kind<00:01:50.700> of<00:01:50.820> story<00:01:51.060> line

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
really sure about any kind of story line

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:52.850 
really sure about any kind of story line
connection<00:01:51.720> with<00:01:51.869> this<00:01:52.020> number<00:01:52.229> six<00:01:52.590> and<00:01:52.770> the

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
connection with this number six and the

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.830 
connection with this number six and the
barbed<00:01:53.040> wire<00:01:53.250> but<00:01:53.790> I<00:01:53.820> do<00:01:54.030> kind<00:01:54.509> of<00:01:54.630> have<00:01:54.689> a

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
barbed wire but I do kind of have a

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.959 
barbed wire but I do kind of have a
feeling<00:01:55.140> that<00:01:55.259> it<00:01:55.439> will<00:01:55.560> lead<00:01:55.799> on<00:01:55.950> to<00:01:56.100> GTA<00:01:56.490> 6<00:01:56.549> on

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
feeling that it will lead on to GTA 6 on

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:59.899 
feeling that it will lead on to GTA 6 on
as<00:01:57.450> the<00:01:57.990> symbol<00:01:58.200> for<00:01:58.500> the<00:01:58.920> you<00:01:59.460> know<00:01:59.549> the<00:01:59.700> five

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
it said it was the V or the number five

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.770 
it said it was the V or the number five
in<00:02:02.040> Roman<00:02:02.310> numerals<00:02:02.340> with<00:02:03.000> five<00:02:03.210> across<00:02:03.479> it

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
that us could put on the box part and

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:08.150 
that us could put on the box part and
right<00:02:07.290> here<00:02:07.439> when<00:02:07.530> I<00:02:07.560> chubb<00:02:07.740> how<00:02:07.860> the<00:02:07.920> plane

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
right here when I chubb how the plane

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.160 
right here when I chubb how the plane
that<00:02:08.190> was<00:02:08.369> a<00:02:08.459> little<00:02:08.729> little<00:02:09.209> exaggerated<00:02:10.050> I

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
that was a little little exaggerated I

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:11.510
