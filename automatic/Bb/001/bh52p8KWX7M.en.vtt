00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
right here because the pain of 50 floors

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:53.330 
right here because the pain of 50 floors
is<00:00:49.700> more<00:00:50.700> than<00:00:50.850> you<00:00:50.910> can<00:00:51.000> handle<00:00:52.100> so<00:00:53.100> if<00:00:53.219> you

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
is more than you can handle so if you

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:54.979 
is more than you can handle so if you
look<00:00:53.520> at<00:00:53.640> 36<00:00:54.210> and<00:00:54.480> your<00:00:54.570> mind<00:00:54.719> quickly

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
look at 36 and your mind quickly

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.319 
look at 36 and your mind quickly
calculates<00:00:55.620> 50<00:00:56.010> floors<00:00:56.219> to<00:00:56.460> go<00:00:56.489> and<00:00:56.879> then<00:00:57.180> it

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
calculates 50 floors to go and then it

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.180 
calculates 50 floors to go and then it
starts<00:00:57.539> processing<00:00:57.719> how<00:00:58.170> many<00:00:58.320> how<00:00:58.770> much<00:00:58.890> pain

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
starts processing how many how much pain

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.250 
starts processing how many how much pain
am<00:00:59.399> I<00:00:59.460> can<00:00:59.609> experience<00:00:59.969> in<00:01:00.210> 50<00:01:00.539> more<00:01:00.780> floors

little bit of pain I can handle it I

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:15.770 
little bit of pain I can handle it I
focus<00:01:13.770> on<00:01:14.040> the<00:01:14.159> pain<00:01:14.400> of<00:01:14.430> that<00:01:14.790> next<00:01:15.060> step<00:01:15.390> that

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
focus on the pain of that next step that

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.960 
focus on the pain of that next step that
I<00:01:15.810> take<00:01:15.869> up<00:01:16.229> the<00:01:16.350> building<00:01:16.560> okay<00:01:17.310> that's<00:01:17.520> well

it's<00:01:18.090> a<00:01:18.150> little<00:01:18.420> more<00:01:18.659> than<00:01:18.720> a<00:01:18.990> little<00:01:19.200> bit<00:01:19.350> of

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
it's a little more than a little bit of

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.399 
it's a little more than a little bit of
payment<00:01:19.740> but<00:01:19.830> I<00:01:19.890> can<00:01:20.040> still<00:01:20.250> handle<00:01:20.520> it<00:01:21.409> we

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
payment but I can still handle it we

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.020 
payment but I can still handle it we
fall<00:01:22.740> down<00:01:22.770> in<00:01:23.159> life<00:01:23.310> because<00:01:23.610> we<00:01:23.729> get<00:01:23.850> ahead

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
fall down in life because we get ahead

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.870 
fall down in life because we get ahead
of<00:01:24.090> ourselves<00:01:24.210> we<00:01:25.189> think<00:01:26.189> too<00:01:26.369> far<00:01:26.580> into<00:01:26.759> the

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
of ourselves we think too far into the

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.520 
of ourselves we think too far into the
future<00:01:27.030> we<00:01:27.299> think<00:01:27.540> about<00:01:27.720> the<00:01:27.780> marathon

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
future we think about the marathon

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.740 
future we think about the marathon
rather<00:01:29.250> than<00:01:29.549> the<00:01:29.700> steps<00:01:30.000> that<00:01:30.299> we<00:01:30.450> need<00:01:30.630> to

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
rather than the steps that we need to

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.340 
rather than the steps that we need to
take<00:01:30.930> which<00:01:31.500> will<00:01:31.680> eventually<00:01:31.770> end<00:01:32.329> 22.6<00:01:33.350> 26.2

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
take which will eventually end 22.6 26.2

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:41.539 
take which will eventually end 22.6 26.2
miles<00:01:34.560> later<00:01:37.520> so<00:01:38.520> get<00:01:38.700> rid<00:01:38.790> of<00:01:38.850> the<00:01:38.970> labels<00:01:40.549> get

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
miles later so get rid of the labels get

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:44.270 
miles later so get rid of the labels get
rid<00:01:41.700> of<00:01:41.729> the<00:01:41.939> shoulds<00:01:42.840> don't<00:01:43.530> should<00:01:43.890> all<00:01:44.040> over

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
rid of the shoulds don't should all over

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.770 
rid of the shoulds don't should all over
yourself<00:01:44.460> I<00:01:44.820> should<00:01:45.090> be<00:01:45.210> this<00:01:45.360> and<00:01:45.540> I<00:01:45.570> should

yourself I should be this and I should
be<00:01:45.899> that<00:01:46.220> but<00:01:47.220> by<00:01:47.340> simply<00:01:47.790> focusing<00:01:48.509> on<00:01:48.720> one

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
be that but by simply focusing on one

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.069 
be that but by simply focusing on one
stair<00:01:49.530> after<00:01:50.430> another<00:01:50.729> after<00:01:51.180> another<00:01:51.659> after

stair after another after another after

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:55.850 
stair after another after another after
another<00:01:52.860> you'll<00:01:53.490> get<00:01:53.610> there
