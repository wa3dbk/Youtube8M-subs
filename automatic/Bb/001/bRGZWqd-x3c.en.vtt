horses<00:00:11.610> and<00:00:11.640> art<00:00:11.970> have<00:00:12.270> defined<00:00:12.870> my<00:00:13.230> life<00:00:14.480> my

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
horses and art have defined my life my

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.560 
horses and art have defined my life my
dad<00:00:15.750> taught<00:00:16.080> me<00:00:16.139> to<00:00:16.619> draw<00:00:16.920> horses<00:00:17.760> when<00:00:18.330> I<00:00:18.360> was

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
dad taught me to draw horses when I was

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.589 
dad taught me to draw horses when I was
about<00:00:18.689> eight<00:00:18.840> years<00:00:19.050> old<00:00:19.529> he<00:00:20.010> also<00:00:20.939> taught<00:00:21.450> me

00:00:21.589 --> 00:00:21.599 
about eight years old he also taught me

00:00:21.599 --> 00:00:24.200 
about eight years old he also taught me
to<00:00:21.689> paint<00:00:22.020> I<00:00:22.470> remember<00:00:23.340> sitting<00:00:23.880> at<00:00:24.119> the

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
to paint I remember sitting at the

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.650 
to paint I remember sitting at the
kitchen<00:00:24.390> table<00:00:24.570> and<00:00:25.670> he<00:00:26.670> taught<00:00:26.970> me<00:00:27.000> through

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
kitchen table and he taught me through

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.430 
kitchen table and he taught me through
geometry<00:00:28.440> how<00:00:28.770> to<00:00:29.779> find<00:00:30.779> the<00:00:30.930> shape<00:00:31.170> of<00:00:31.320> a

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:31.440 
geometry how to find the shape of a

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:35.540 
geometry how to find the shape of a
horse<00:00:31.699> and<00:00:32.720> so<00:00:33.720> I<00:00:33.750> spent<00:00:34.110> a<00:00:34.170> lot<00:00:34.350> of<00:00:34.379> time<00:00:34.550> with

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
horse and so I spent a lot of time with

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.490 
horse and so I spent a lot of time with
other<00:00:35.850> children<00:00:36.239> while<00:00:36.690> my<00:00:36.900> children<00:00:37.350> were

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
other children while my children were

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.610 
other children while my children were
young<00:00:37.530> and<00:00:38.360> helped<00:00:39.360> them<00:00:39.480> draw<00:00:39.780> on<00:00:39.930> paint<00:00:40.230> and

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
young and helped them draw on paint and

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.170 
young and helped them draw on paint and
a<00:00:41.610> lot<00:00:41.850> of<00:00:41.879> times<00:00:43.550> they<00:00:44.550> wanted<00:00:44.909> to<00:00:45.000> draw

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
a lot of times they wanted to draw

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.149 
a lot of times they wanted to draw
horses<00:00:45.449> too<00:00:45.839> because<00:00:46.199> they<00:00:46.350> saw<00:00:46.559> that<00:00:46.589> I<00:00:46.800> drew

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:47.159 
horses too because they saw that I drew

00:00:47.159 --> 00:00:50.719 
horses too because they saw that I drew
them<00:00:47.339> so<00:00:48.210> the<00:00:48.809> cool<00:00:49.080> thing<00:00:49.110> was<00:00:49.650> I<00:00:50.040> could<00:00:50.549> just

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:50.729 
them so the cool thing was I could just

00:00:50.729 --> 00:00:53.560 
them so the cool thing was I could just
pass<00:00:50.970> on<00:00:51.210> everything<00:00:51.809> that<00:00:51.839> my<00:00:52.170> dad<00:00:52.470> taught<00:00:53.159> me

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:53.570 
pass on everything that my dad taught me

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:59.119 
pass on everything that my dad taught me
to<00:00:54.570> hundreds<00:00:55.530> of<00:00:55.650> little<00:00:55.860> kids<00:00:56.220> I<00:00:57.890> start<00:00:58.890> most

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
to hundreds of little kids I start most

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:02.270 
to hundreds of little kids I start most
of<00:00:59.339> my<00:00:59.430> paintings<00:00:59.729> outside<00:01:00.510> and<00:01:01.190> for<00:01:02.190> an

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
of my paintings outside and for an

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.340 
of my paintings outside and for an
underpainting<00:01:02.760> I<00:01:02.970> put<00:01:03.540> a<00:01:03.570> lot<00:01:03.750> of<00:01:03.809> paint<00:01:04.110> down

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
underpainting I put a lot of paint down

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.940 
underpainting I put a lot of paint down
and<00:01:04.769> I<00:01:05.070> move<00:01:05.339> it<00:01:05.489> around<00:01:06.200> that<00:01:07.200> is<00:01:07.380> because<00:01:07.560> I

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
and I move it around that is because I

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.030 
and I move it around that is because I
don't<00:01:08.280> like<00:01:08.460> to<00:01:08.700> sit<00:01:08.909> in<00:01:09.090> a<00:01:09.180> studio<00:01:09.570> and<00:01:10.049> think

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
don't like to sit in a studio and think

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.929 
don't like to sit in a studio and think
about<00:01:11.930> what<00:01:12.930> I'm<00:01:13.110> going<00:01:13.380> to<00:01:13.469> paint<00:01:13.920> once<00:01:14.759> I

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
about what I'm going to paint once I

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:17.749 
about what I'm going to paint once I
have<00:01:15.180> a<00:01:15.479> base<00:01:16.409> coat<00:01:16.770> of<00:01:16.950> paint<00:01:17.159> on<00:01:17.399> it<00:01:17.460> an

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
have a base coat of paint on it an

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:20.950 
have a base coat of paint on it an
underpainting<00:01:18.450> once<00:01:19.140> that<00:01:19.469> is<00:01:19.859> established

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:20.960 
underpainting once that is established

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:25.669 
underpainting once that is established
the<00:01:21.960> painting<00:01:22.409> takes<00:01:22.770> a<00:01:22.979> form<00:01:23.369> to<00:01:23.609> me<00:01:23.960> and<00:01:24.960> even

00:01:25.669 --> 00:01:25.679 
the painting takes a form to me and even

00:01:25.679 --> 00:01:27.649 
the painting takes a form to me and even
though<00:01:25.799> in<00:01:25.979> this<00:01:26.159> situation<00:01:27.090> it's<00:01:27.570> a

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
though in this situation it's a

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.319 
though in this situation it's a
commission<00:01:28.170> and<00:01:28.380> I<00:01:28.530> have<00:01:28.740> a<00:01:28.770> set<00:01:29.700> drawing<00:01:30.060> that

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
commission and I have a set drawing that

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.450 
commission and I have a set drawing that
I'm<00:01:30.479> going<00:01:30.719> to<00:01:30.810> work<00:01:31.020> to<00:01:31.320> that<00:01:31.829> under<00:01:32.189> painting

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
I'm going to work to that under painting

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.569 
I'm going to work to that under painting
really<00:01:33.090> helps<00:01:33.479> give<00:01:33.750> the<00:01:33.929> energy<00:01:34.500> to<00:01:35.219> the<00:01:35.250> work

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
really helps give the energy to the work

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:39.080 
really helps give the energy to the work
that<00:01:36.060> I<00:01:36.090> think<00:01:36.600> the<00:01:36.810> work<00:01:36.990> needs<00:01:37.320> and<00:01:38.090> working

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
that I think the work needs and working

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.230 
that I think the work needs and working
outside<00:01:39.509> to<00:01:39.899> begin<00:01:40.200> with<00:01:40.789> it's<00:01:41.789> a<00:01:41.939> big

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
outside to begin with it's a big

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.230 
outside to begin with it's a big
physical<00:01:43.229> challenge<00:01:44.070> but<00:01:44.310> I<00:01:44.520> feel<00:01:44.880> like<00:01:45.060> it

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
physical challenge but I feel like it

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.770 
physical challenge but I feel like it
adds<00:01:45.420> so<00:01:45.659> much<00:01:45.689> energy<00:01:46.289> to<00:01:47.280> the<00:01:47.310> work<00:01:47.670> that<00:01:48.659> i

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
adds so much energy to the work that i

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:53.870 
adds so much energy to the work that i
can't<00:01:49.079> i<00:01:49.229> have<00:01:49.259> to<00:01:49.499> do<00:01:49.829> it<00:01:49.979> i<00:01:52.579> paid<00:01:53.579> with<00:01:53.700> my

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
can't i have to do it i paid with my

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.859 
can't i have to do it i paid with my
hands<00:01:54.359> and<00:01:54.509> sticks<00:01:55.109> and<00:01:55.499> brooms<00:01:55.819> etc<00:01:56.819> and<00:01:57.030> i

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
hands and sticks and brooms etc and i

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.499 
hands and sticks and brooms etc and i
make<00:01:58.350> a<00:01:58.460> monoprint<00:01:59.460> when<00:01:59.729> i<00:01:59.759> put<00:02:00.060> two<00:02:00.240> canvases

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
make a monoprint when i put two canvases

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:03.730 
make a monoprint when i put two canvases
together<00:02:01.399> because<00:02:02.399> to<00:02:02.609> me<00:02:02.789> it<00:02:03.149> looks

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:03.740 
together because to me it looks

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:05.630 
together because to me it looks
uncontrived

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
uncontrived

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.450 
uncontrived
and<00:02:05.729> that's<00:02:06.270> the<00:02:07.260> effect<00:02:07.500> i<00:02:07.740> really<00:02:08.160> want<00:02:08.369> to

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:08.460 
and that's the effect i really want to

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:11.480 
and that's the effect i really want to
get<00:02:08.610> I<00:02:09.229> want<00:02:10.229> to<00:02:10.289> get<00:02:10.380> something<00:02:10.679> that<00:02:11.039> cannot

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:11.490 
get I want to get something that cannot

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:15.199 
get I want to get something that cannot
be<00:02:11.550> reproduced<00:02:12.170> I<00:02:13.170> mean<00:02:14.040> I'll<00:02:14.370> photo<00:02:14.580> image<00:02:14.940> s

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:17.750 
be reproduced I mean I'll photo image s
but<00:02:15.540> it<00:02:15.690> could<00:02:16.020> nobody<00:02:16.650> could<00:02:17.010> take<00:02:17.250> and<00:02:17.490> copy

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
but it could nobody could take and copy

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.180 
but it could nobody could take and copy
one<00:02:18.120> of<00:02:18.209> my<00:02:18.390> paintings<00:02:18.720> because<00:02:19.620> first<00:02:19.950> of<00:02:20.069> all

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
one of my paintings because first of all

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:24.790 
one of my paintings because first of all
my<00:02:20.370> fingerprints<00:02:21.090> are<00:02:21.240> in<00:02:21.420> every<00:02:21.930> one<00:02:22.140> of<00:02:22.290> them

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:24.800 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:42.300 

it's<00:02:25.800> one<00:02:26.160> of<00:02:26.190> a<00:02:26.370> kind

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:46.380 

so<00:02:43.310> throughout<00:02:43.910> the<00:02:44.120> painting<00:02:44.569> I<00:02:45.040> constantly

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:46.390 
so throughout the painting I constantly

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:49.270 
so throughout the painting I constantly
thought<00:02:47.390> about<00:02:47.660> what<00:02:47.989> that<00:02:48.140> day<00:02:48.379> represents

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:49.280 
thought about what that day represents
