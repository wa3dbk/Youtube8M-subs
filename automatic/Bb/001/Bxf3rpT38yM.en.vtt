Christian<00:00:07.770> is<00:00:07.919> that<00:00:08.820> they<00:00:09.090> are<00:00:09.389> bound<00:00:10.139> and

walked<00:00:13.860> with<00:00:14.099> the<00:00:14.190> dinosaurs<00:00:14.670> I<00:00:14.940> mean<00:00:15.660> let's

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
walked with the dinosaurs I mean let's

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:17.180 
walked with the dinosaurs I mean let's
be<00:00:15.929> honest<00:00:16.260> if<00:00:16.379> you<00:00:16.410> believe<00:00:16.800> that<00:00:16.830> the<00:00:17.070> earth

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
be honest if you believe that the earth

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.330 
be honest if you believe that the earth
is<00:00:17.400> only<00:00:17.460> 6,000<00:00:18.390> years<00:00:18.630> old<00:00:18.980> you<00:00:19.980> have<00:00:20.160> no

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
is only 6,000 years old you have no

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.010 
is only 6,000 years old you have no
choice<00:00:20.609> I<00:00:20.939> mean<00:00:21.210> you<00:00:21.330> have<00:00:21.539> to<00:00:21.750> believe<00:00:21.960> that

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
choice I mean you have to believe that

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.359 
choice I mean you have to believe that
as<00:00:22.350> part<00:00:22.560> of<00:00:22.650> your<00:00:23.119> biblical<00:00:25.279> ensemble<00:00:26.279> of

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
as part of your biblical ensemble of

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:28.849 
as part of your biblical ensemble of
beliefs<00:00:26.760> and<00:00:27.109> now<00:00:28.109> the<00:00:28.170> problem<00:00:28.410> with<00:00:28.619> this<00:00:28.710> of

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
beliefs and now the problem with this of

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:30.560 
beliefs and now the problem with this of
course<00:00:28.890> is<00:00:29.220> that<00:00:29.279> you<00:00:29.490> also<00:00:29.730> have<00:00:30.150> to<00:00:30.300> believe

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
course is that you also have to believe

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.350 
course is that you also have to believe
therefore<00:00:30.929> that<00:00:31.460> these<00:00:32.460> animals<00:00:32.880> these

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
therefore that these animals these

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.880 
therefore that these animals these
dinosaurs<00:00:33.989> also<00:00:34.559> got<00:00:35.280> on<00:00:35.399> the<00:00:35.520> ark<00:00:35.550> with<00:00:36.329> Noah

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:36.890 
dinosaurs also got on the ark with Noah

dinosaurs also got on the ark with Noah

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379

I<00:01:15.170> can<00:01:16.170> only<00:01:16.320> assume<00:01:16.530> that<00:01:16.799> this<00:01:17.009> must<00:01:17.250> have

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
I can only assume that this must have

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.249 
I can only assume that this must have
been<00:01:17.490> some<00:01:17.850> kind<00:01:18.060> of<00:01:18.119> a<00:01:18.210> mistake<00:01:18.240> on<00:01:18.840> God's

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
been some kind of a mistake on God's

pissing for 12 months that'd be miracles
on<00:03:41.560> my<00:03:41.709> side<00:03:42.040> I<00:03:42.370> can't<00:03:43.090> do<00:03:43.360> that<00:03:43.390> come<00:03:44.230> on<00:03:44.380> board

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:44.590 
on my side I can't do that come on board

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:45.690 
on my side I can't do that come on board
there's<00:03:44.769> only<00:03:44.890> eight<00:03:45.100> of<00:03:45.130> us<00:03:45.280> on<00:03:45.430> the<00:03:45.489> bloody

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:45.700 
there's only eight of us on the bloody

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:48.600 
there's only eight of us on the bloody
bugger<00:03:45.970> i'm<00:03:46.180> not<00:03:46.390> gonna<00:03:46.570> do<00:03:46.810> that<00:03:47.489> but<00:03:48.489> it's

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:48.610 
bugger i'm not gonna do that but it's

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:56.700 
bugger i'm not gonna do that but it's
gonna<00:03:48.700> be<00:03:48.930> 1200

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:56.710 

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:59.970 

now<00:03:57.490> I<00:03:57.790> don't<00:03:57.970> know<00:03:58.210> about<00:03:58.240> you<00:03:58.720> but<00:03:58.750> I<00:03:59.230> really

00:03:59.970 --> 00:03:59.980 
now I don't know about you but I really

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:03.420 
now I don't know about you but I really
love<00:04:00.010> science<00:04:00.640> because<00:04:00.750> with<00:04:01.750> science<00:04:02.290> we<00:04:03.220> can

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:03.430 
love science because with science we can

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:05.910 
love science because with science we can
find<00:04:03.760> shit<00:04:04.150> out<00:04:04.270> in<00:04:04.900> fact<00:04:05.260> we've<00:04:05.500> been<00:04:05.650> finding

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:05.920 
find shit out in fact we've been finding

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:08.580 
find shit out in fact we've been finding
shit<00:04:06.370> out<00:04:06.610> with<00:04:06.910> science<00:04:07.390> ever<00:04:08.080> since<00:04:08.350> we've

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:08.590 
shit out with science ever since we've

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:09.630 
shit out with science ever since we've
been<00:04:08.710> able<00:04:08.830> to<00:04:09.010> do<00:04:09.130> any<00:04:09.250> kind<00:04:09.460> of

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:09.640 
been able to do any kind of

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:11.670 
been able to do any kind of
experimentation<00:04:10.630> I<00:04:10.960> mean<00:04:11.140> anything<00:04:11.530> from

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:11.680 
experimentation I mean anything from

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:14.160 
experimentation I mean anything from
just<00:04:11.860> dropping<00:04:12.340> an<00:04:12.430> apple<00:04:12.730> to<00:04:12.910> test<00:04:13.570> gravity

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:14.170 
just dropping an apple to test gravity

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:16.620 
just dropping an apple to test gravity
to<00:04:14.460> ya<00:04:15.460> something<00:04:15.790> really<00:04:16.060> modern<00:04:16.450> like

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:16.630 
to ya something really modern like

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:20.010 
to ya something really modern like
sequencing<00:04:17.320> DNA<00:04:17.500> and<00:04:18.390> in<00:04:19.390> fact<00:04:19.720> on<00:04:19.900> the

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:20.020 
sequencing DNA and in fact on the

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:22.740 
sequencing DNA and in fact on the
subject<00:04:20.470> of<00:04:20.590> sequencing<00:04:21.130> DNA<00:04:21.540> it<00:04:22.540> is

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:22.750 
subject of sequencing DNA it is

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:25.440 
subject of sequencing DNA it is
incredible<00:04:23.470> the<00:04:24.040> leaks<00:04:24.610> that<00:04:24.880> we've<00:04:25.120> made<00:04:25.390> in

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:25.450 
incredible the leaks that we've made in

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:28.050 
incredible the leaks that we've made in
I<00:04:25.810> mean<00:04:25.990> we've<00:04:26.230> actually<00:04:26.590> now<00:04:27.220> sequenced<00:04:27.940> the

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:28.060 
I mean we've actually now sequenced the

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:31.560 
I mean we've actually now sequenced the
DNA<00:04:28.620> from<00:04:29.620> a<00:04:30.040> woolly<00:04:30.760> mammoth<00:04:31.180> I<00:04:31.300> mean<00:04:31.450> we've

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:31.570 
DNA from a woolly mammoth I mean we've

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:33.690 
DNA from a woolly mammoth I mean we've
actually<00:04:31.870> done<00:04:32.380> that<00:04:32.440> yeah<00:04:33.310> it's<00:04:33.490> a<00:04:33.520> very

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:33.700 
actually done that yeah it's a very

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:35.970 
actually done that yeah it's a very
fucking<00:04:34.060> royal<00:04:34.300> way<00:04:34.600> I<00:04:34.630> mean<00:04:34.900> personally<00:04:35.650> I

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:35.980 
fucking royal way I mean personally I

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:38.640 
fucking royal way I mean personally I
had<00:04:36.250> very<00:04:36.430> little<00:04:36.700> to<00:04:36.910> do<00:04:37.000> with<00:04:37.030> it<00:04:37.210> but<00:04:37.720> we've

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:38.650 
had very little to do with it but we've

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:42.450 
had very little to do with it but we've
actually<00:04:38.680> as<00:04:39.460> a<00:04:40.440> collective<00:04:41.440> kind<00:04:42.190> of<00:04:42.280> done

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:42.460 
actually as a collective kind of done

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:45.300 
actually as a collective kind of done
that<00:04:42.490> and<00:04:43.140> now<00:04:44.140> I'm<00:04:44.470> not<00:04:44.650> saying<00:04:44.980> that<00:04:45.130> the

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:45.310 
that and now I'm not saying that the

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:49.470 
that and now I'm not saying that the
genetic<00:04:45.760> material<00:04:46.590> that<00:04:47.590> is<00:04:47.740> used<00:04:47.770> and<00:04:48.490> you

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:49.480 
genetic material that is used and you

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:52.110 
genetic material that is used and you
know<00:04:49.690> is<00:04:49.960> always<00:04:50.950> in<00:04:51.190> the<00:04:51.340> best<00:04:51.490> conditions

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:52.120 
know is always in the best conditions

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:54.900 
know is always in the best conditions
but<00:04:52.420> we<00:04:53.080> have<00:04:53.290> been<00:04:53.530> able<00:04:53.650> to<00:04:53.860> do<00:04:53.980> it<00:04:54.160> and<00:04:54.370> the

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:54.910 
but we have been able to do it and the

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:57.030 
but we have been able to do it and the
better<00:04:55.120> the<00:04:55.300> genetic<00:04:55.720> material<00:04:55.830> the<00:04:56.830> better

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:57.040 
better the genetic material the better

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:59.640 
better the genetic material the better
the<00:04:57.160> results<00:04:57.280> but<00:04:58.210> the<00:04:58.330> very<00:04:58.510> fact<00:04:58.630> that<00:04:58.960> we've

00:04:59.640 --> 00:04:59.650 
the results but the very fact that we've

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:02.820 
the results but the very fact that we've
been<00:04:59.860> with<00:05:00.580> we<00:05:01.030> through<00:05:01.690> that<00:05:01.870> no<00:05:02.380> you<00:05:02.620> see

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:02.830 
been with we through that no you see

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:05.100 
been with we through that no you see
evolution<00:05:03.460> one<00:05:03.970> of<00:05:04.090> these<00:05:04.240> days<00:05:04.600> it's<00:05:04.960> gonna

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:05.110 
evolution one of these days it's gonna

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:07.770 
evolution one of these days it's gonna
stop<00:05:05.470> people<00:05:05.950> getting<00:05:06.490> their<00:05:06.610> tongues<00:05:06.940> tided

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:07.780 
stop people getting their tongues tided

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:10.470 
stop people getting their tongues tided
bastard<00:05:08.470> anyway<00:05:08.980> or<00:05:09.730> is<00:05:09.880> it<00:05:09.940> the<00:05:10.060> devil<00:05:10.330> who

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:10.480 
bastard anyway or is it the devil who

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:14.160 
bastard anyway or is it the devil who
knows<00:05:10.720> so<00:05:11.880> where<00:05:12.880> was<00:05:13.000> I<00:05:13.150> have<00:05:13.330> fucking<00:05:13.990> up

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:14.170 
knows so where was I have fucking up

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:16.800 
knows so where was I have fucking up
yeah<00:05:14.890> so<00:05:15.190> not<00:05:15.520> only<00:05:15.550> have<00:05:16.030> we<00:05:16.210> done<00:05:16.420> this<00:05:16.480> we've

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:16.810 
yeah so not only have we done this we've

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:19.290 
yeah so not only have we done this we've
actually<00:05:17.080> sequence<00:05:17.800> the<00:05:17.920> DNA<00:05:17.950> from<00:05:18.370> old<00:05:18.730> dead

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:19.300 
actually sequence the DNA from old dead

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:22.110 
actually sequence the DNA from old dead
human<00:05:19.870> bones<00:05:20.110> and<00:05:20.500> cavemen<00:05:20.980> bones<00:05:21.280> and<00:05:21.640> you

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:25.180 
know other long dead animal but i don't

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:27.870 
know other long dead animal but i don't

mean long long dead animals as in long
animals<00:05:28.330> at<00:05:28.570> all<00:05:28.990> that<00:05:29.260> we<00:05:29.320> could<00:05:29.440> do<00:05:29.560> long

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:29.740 
animals at all that we could do long

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:32.430 
animals at all that we could do long
animals<00:05:29.920> I<00:05:30.280> mean<00:05:30.960> animals<00:05:31.960> little<00:05:32.200> bit<00:05:32.290> longer

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:36.750 
animals I mean animals little bit longer
but<00:05:33.250> we've<00:05:33.400> done<00:05:33.430> that<00:05:33.760> as<00:05:33.910> well<00:05:34.560> however<00:05:35.760> on

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:36.760 
but we've done that as well however on

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:38.790 
but we've done that as well however on
the<00:05:36.910> subject<00:05:37.300> of<00:05:37.390> long<00:05:37.690> animals<00:05:37.930> we<00:05:38.350> haven't

that<00:05:49.720> anyway<00:05:50.430> why<00:05:51.430> should<00:05:51.460> that<00:05:51.850> be<00:05:52.090> i<00:05:52.120> mean<00:05:52.240> if

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:52.660 
that anyway why should that be i mean if

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:53.820 
that anyway why should that be i mean if
the<00:05:52.690> dinosaurs<00:05:53.110> lived<00:05:53.710> contemporaneously

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:53.830 
the dinosaurs lived contemporaneously

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:57.630 
the dinosaurs lived contemporaneously
with<00:05:54.760> math<00:05:55.240> and<00:05:55.510> the<00:05:55.540> other<00:05:56.200> animals<00:05:56.650> why<00:05:57.580> is

00:05:57.630 --> 00:05:57.640 
with math and the other animals why is

00:05:57.640 --> 00:05:59.520 
with math and the other animals why is
it<00:05:58.000> that<00:05:58.030> we<00:05:58.300> haven't<00:05:58.600> been<00:05:58.720> able<00:05:58.900> to<00:05:59.170> sequence

00:05:59.520 --> 00:05:59.530 
it that we haven't been able to sequence

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:04.500 
it that we haven't been able to sequence
their<00:06:00.460> DNA<00:06:01.950> doesn't<00:06:02.950> make<00:06:03.100> any<00:06:03.250> sense<00:06:03.520> of

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:04.510 
their DNA doesn't make any sense of

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:05.670 
their DNA doesn't make any sense of
course<00:06:04.810> if<00:06:04.930> you're<00:06:05.020> a<00:06:05.080> fundamentalist

00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:05.680 
course if you're a fundamentalist

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:07.380 
course if you're a fundamentalist
christian<00:06:06.160> you<00:06:06.310> have<00:06:06.520> the<00:06:06.700> answer<00:06:07.060> that<00:06:07.210> it's

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:07.390 
christian you have the answer that it's

00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:09.810 
christian you have the answer that it's
obvious<00:06:07.810> it's<00:06:08.470> bleeding<00:06:08.919> devil<00:06:09.250> and<00:06:09.400> past<00:06:09.580> and

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:09.820 
obvious it's bleeding devil and past and

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:10.230 
obvious it's bleeding devil and past and
messing

00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:10.240

fucking<00:06:10.569> genetic<00:06:10.960> material<00:06:11.410> II<00:06:11.500> can't<00:06:12.069> keep

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:12.250 
fucking genetic material II can't keep

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:14.219 
fucking genetic material II can't keep
his<00:06:12.400> bloody<00:06:12.580> hands<00:06:12.910> off<00:06:13.000> it<00:06:13.120> Kelly<00:06:13.330> can't

leave him in over five minutes that

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:17.070 
leave him in over five minutes that
bastard<00:06:16.090> always<00:06:16.330> fucking<00:06:16.690> about<00:06:16.930> with

00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:17.080 
bastard always fucking about with

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:19.020 
bastard always fucking about with
something<00:06:17.410> so<00:06:18.099> it's<00:06:18.190> clearly<00:06:18.460> the<00:06:18.580> devil's

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:19.030 
something so it's clearly the devil's

00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:20.730 
something so it's clearly the devil's
fault<00:06:19.240> because<00:06:19.389> he's<00:06:19.599> obviously<00:06:20.020> petrified

00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:20.740 
fault because he's obviously petrified

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:22.860 
fault because he's obviously petrified
and<00:06:21.009> fossilized<00:06:21.789> the<00:06:22.120> stuff<00:06:22.389> to<00:06:22.569> such<00:06:22.840> a

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:22.870 
and fossilized the stuff to such a

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:27.320 
and fossilized the stuff to such a
fucking<00:06:23.349> state<00:06:24.039> that<00:06:24.449> cannot<00:06:25.449> be<00:06:25.569> done<00:06:25.690> or

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:27.330 
fucking state that cannot be done or

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:29.700 
fucking state that cannot be done or
alternatively<00:06:28.330> maybe<00:06:28.509> as<00:06:29.110> the<00:06:29.319> evidence

00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:29.710 
alternatively maybe as the evidence

00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:31.860 
alternatively maybe as the evidence
shows<00:06:29.979> maybe<00:06:30.759> it's<00:06:31.030> a<00:06:31.120> separation<00:06:31.780> of

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:31.870 
shows maybe it's a separation of

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:34.290 
shows maybe it's a separation of
millions<00:06:32.259> of<00:06:32.380> years<00:06:32.440> between<00:06:33.190> the<00:06:33.550> dinosaurs

00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:34.300 
millions of years between the dinosaurs

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:36.540 
millions of years between the dinosaurs
and<00:06:34.419> man<00:06:35.080> and<00:06:35.259> the<00:06:35.349> other<00:06:35.470> animals<00:06:35.949> that<00:06:36.130> is

00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:36.550 
and man and the other animals that is

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:40.710 
and man and the other animals that is
really<00:06:37.889> partly<00:06:38.889> responsible<00:06:39.250> or<00:06:40.030> entirely

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:40.720 
really partly responsible or entirely

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:42.870 
really partly responsible or entirely
responsible<00:06:41.199> if<00:06:41.680> you<00:06:42.190> want<00:06:42.370> to<00:06:42.460> really<00:06:42.699> go

00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:42.880 
responsible if you want to really go

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:48.350 
responsible if you want to really go
with<00:06:43.000> the<00:06:43.090> evidence<00:06:43.560> for<00:06:44.560> that<00:06:44.909> reason<00:06:47.099> so

00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:48.360 
with the evidence for that reason so

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:50.520 
with the evidence for that reason so
there<00:06:49.360> we<00:06:49.509> have<00:06:49.539> it<00:06:49.720> there<00:06:49.930> the<00:06:50.020> thing<00:06:50.229> is<00:06:50.380> with

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:50.530 
there we have it there the thing is with

00:06:50.530 --> 00:06:53.040 
there we have it there the thing is with
science<00:06:51.039> is<00:06:51.250> that<00:06:51.490> as<00:06:51.699> far<00:06:52.000> as<00:06:52.060> the<00:06:52.330> age<00:06:52.569> of<00:06:52.810> man

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:53.050 
science is that as far as the age of man

00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:54.870 
science is that as far as the age of man
is<00:06:53.199> concerned<00:06:53.409> and<00:06:53.949> how<00:06:54.099> long<00:06:54.340> man's<00:06:54.639> been
