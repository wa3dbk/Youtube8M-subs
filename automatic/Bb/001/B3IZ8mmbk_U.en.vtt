information about the camera okay thank
you<00:00:14.700> yeah<00:00:14.880> so<00:00:15.299> this<00:00:15.480> is<00:00:15.599> our<00:00:15.750> new<00:00:15.929> 5d<00:00:16.710> Mark<00:00:16.920> 3<00:00:16.980> or

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
you yeah so this is our new 5d Mark 3 or

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.010 
you yeah so this is our new 5d Mark 3 or
C<00:00:17.400> is<00:00:17.460> quite<00:00:17.820> different<00:00:18.090> camera<00:00:18.570> to<00:00:18.720> the<00:00:18.810> mark

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
C is quite different camera to the mark

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.500 
C is quite different camera to the mark
2<00:00:19.320> and<00:00:20.010> what<00:00:20.220> we<00:00:20.369> makes<00:00:20.670> us<00:00:20.820> different<00:00:21.029> is<00:00:21.359> the

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
2 and what we makes us different is the

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.170 
2 and what we makes us different is the
AF<00:00:21.750> system<00:00:22.020> we've<00:00:22.710> now<00:00:22.830> got<00:00:23.010> 61<00:00:23.609> point<00:00:23.880> AF

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
AF system we've now got 61 point AF

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:25.970 
AF system we've now got 61 point AF
system<00:00:24.630> which<00:00:24.810> is<00:00:24.869> actually<00:00:24.990> same<00:00:25.410> AF<00:00:25.619> system

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
system which is actually same AF system

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.279 
system which is actually same AF system
we've<00:00:26.070> gotten<00:00:26.369> our<00:00:26.490> one<00:00:27.060> DX<00:00:27.420> which<00:00:28.080> is<00:00:28.109> our

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
we've gotten our one DX which is our

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.259 
we've gotten our one DX which is our
professional<00:00:28.769> level<00:00:29.070> camera<00:00:29.429> also<00:00:30.029> this

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
professional level camera also this

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.900 
professional level camera also this
camera<00:00:30.510> runs<00:00:30.810> the<00:00:30.960> six<00:00:31.230> frames<00:00:31.560> a<00:00:31.769> second<00:00:32.219> so

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
camera runs the six frames a second so

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.299 
camera runs the six frames a second so
it's<00:00:33.059> a<00:00:33.149> lot<00:00:33.329> faster<00:00:33.570> the<00:00:33.960> 5d<00:00:34.649> mark<00:00:34.829> ii<00:00:34.860> runs<00:00:35.190> at

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
it's a lot faster the 5d mark ii runs at

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:36.979 
it's a lot faster the 5d mark ii runs at
three<00:00:35.520> point<00:00:35.790> nine<00:00:35.910> so<00:00:36.540> you<00:00:36.600> can<00:00:36.719> see<00:00:36.840> that

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
three point nine so you can see that

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:38.299 
three point nine so you can see that
this<00:00:37.110> camera<00:00:37.380> will<00:00:37.620> actually<00:00:37.860> be<00:00:37.950> really

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
this camera will actually be really

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.639 
this camera will actually be really
suited<00:00:38.670> not<00:00:38.850> just<00:00:39.149> for<00:00:39.390> landscape<00:00:40.170> of<00:00:40.379> course

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
suited not just for landscape of course

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.610 
suited not just for landscape of course
during<00:00:40.890> this<00:00:41.070> kind<00:00:41.340> of<00:00:41.370> thing<00:00:41.579> but<00:00:42.000> also<00:00:42.149> for

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:42.620 
during this kind of thing but also for

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:45.229 
during this kind of thing but also for
sports<00:00:43.620> photography<00:00:44.280> and<00:00:44.430> any<00:00:44.520> sort<00:00:44.789> of<00:00:44.850> any

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
sports photography and any sort of any

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.200 
sports photography and any sort of any
sort<00:00:45.570> of<00:00:45.600> action<00:00:45.960> work

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.360 

but<00:00:48.840> then<00:00:48.990> says<00:00:49.260> twenty<00:00:49.890> two<00:00:50.010> point<00:00:50.220> three

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
but then says twenty two point three

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.820 
but then says twenty two point three
million<00:00:50.670> pixels<00:00:51.320> we<00:00:52.320> have<00:00:52.440> that<00:00:52.620> with<00:00:52.739> our

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:52.830 
million pixels we have that with our

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:54.650 
million pixels we have that with our
digit<00:00:53.100> five<00:00:53.310> plus<00:00:53.670> processor<00:00:54.300> which<00:00:54.630> is

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
digit five plus processor which is

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.860 
digit five plus processor which is
actually<00:00:55.110> the<00:00:55.530> one<00:00:56.309> DX<00:00:56.640> has<00:00:57.000> two<00:00:57.360> digit<00:00:57.690> five

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
actually the one DX has two digit five

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.500 
actually the one DX has two digit five
devices<00:00:58.410> similar<00:00:58.890> technology<00:00:59.520> to<00:00:59.550> them<00:00:59.790> and

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
devices similar technology to them and

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.810 
devices similar technology to them and
this<00:01:00.660> actually<00:01:00.960> gives<00:01:01.080> us<00:01:01.260> an<00:01:01.380> expand<00:01:01.739> rice<00:01:02.010> of

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
this actually gives us an expand rice of

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.710 
this actually gives us an expand rice of
50<00:01:03.330> up<00:01:03.510> to<00:01:03.540> 100<00:01:04.400> 2400<00:01:05.400> which<00:01:06.360> was<00:01:06.540> actually

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
50 up to 100 2400 which was actually

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.810 
50 up to 100 2400 which was actually
same<00:01:07.020> as<00:01:07.140> I<00:01:07.229> one<00:01:07.410> being<00:01:07.650> mark<00:01:07.830> four<00:01:08.160> okay<00:01:08.670> so

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
same as I one being mark four okay so

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.060 
same as I one being mark four okay so
has<00:01:09.210> IRS's<00:01:09.540> ISO<00:01:09.960> range<00:01:10.170> we're<00:01:10.440> saying<00:01:10.680> that

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
has IRS's ISO range we're saying that

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.040 
has IRS's ISO range we're saying that
this<00:01:11.430> camera<00:01:11.670> has<00:01:11.940> a<00:01:11.970> two-stop<00:01:12.450> advantage

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:13.050 
this camera has a two-stop advantage

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:16.070 
this camera has a two-stop advantage
over<00:01:13.590> the<00:01:13.800> 5d<00:01:14.220> mark<00:01:14.430> ii<00:01:14.520> so<00:01:14.910> say<00:01:15.090> if<00:01:15.450> we<00:01:15.690> used<00:01:15.869> to

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
over the 5d mark ii so say if we used to

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.850 
over the 5d mark ii so say if we used to
shoot<00:01:16.830> him<00:01:17.040> at<00:01:17.780> 450<00:01:18.780> months<00:01:19.050> to<00:01:19.200> actually

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
shoot him at 450 months to actually

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.429 
shoot him at 450 months to actually
shoot<00:01:20.100> a<00:01:20.250> 16<00:01:20.670> de<00:01:20.729> novo

JPEGs<00:01:45.070> before<00:01:45.460> that<00:01:45.580> how<00:01:45.670> much<00:01:45.850> has<00:01:46.030> slowed

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:46.240 
JPEGs before that how much has slowed

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:48.240 
JPEGs before that how much has slowed
down<00:01:46.510> so<00:01:46.960> shows<00:01:47.170> how<00:01:47.350> powerful<00:01:47.530> the<00:01:47.799> processor
