just absolute tremendous service the
only<00:02:15.659> time<00:02:15.870> it's<00:02:16.170> ever<00:02:16.230> been<00:02:16.500> broken<00:02:17.099> and<00:02:17.610> the

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
only time it's ever been broken and the

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.569 
only time it's ever been broken and the
time<00:02:17.939> I've<00:02:18.150> been<00:02:18.360> here<00:02:18.629> is<00:02:19.069> once<00:02:20.069> during<00:02:20.280> a

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:20.579 
time I've been here is once during a

00:02:20.579 --> 00:02:22.460 
time I've been here is once during a
pretty<00:02:20.879> tremendous<00:02:21.209> blizzard<00:02:21.810> and<00:02:22.049> you<00:02:22.349> do

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
pretty tremendous blizzard and you do

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:24.140 
pretty tremendous blizzard and you do
have<00:02:22.620> to<00:02:22.769> go<00:02:22.860> out<00:02:22.950> sweep<00:02:23.370> off<00:02:23.519> your<00:02:23.700> satellite

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
have to go out sweep off your satellite

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:25.520 
have to go out sweep off your satellite
dish<00:02:24.180> once<00:02:24.629> in<00:02:24.780> a<00:02:24.840> while<00:02:24.989> but<00:02:25.200> that's<00:02:25.349> an

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
dish once in a while but that's an

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:30.380 
dish once in a while but that's an
adventure<00:02:26.629> and<00:02:27.629> I<00:02:27.900> think<00:02:28.200> that<00:02:28.909> covers<00:02:29.909> for

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
adventure and I think that covers for

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:32.330 
adventure and I think that covers for
the<00:02:30.510> small<00:02:30.840> year<00:02:31.140> of<00:02:31.920> course<00:02:32.159> you've<00:02:32.310> got

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
the small year of course you've got

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:39.800 
the small year of course you've got
electric<00:02:32.879> in<00:02:33.030> here<00:02:33.060> and<00:02:33.810> then<00:02:36.590> yeah<00:02:38.629> let's<00:02:39.629> go

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
electric in here and then yeah let's go

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:41.899 
electric in here and then yeah let's go
on<00:02:39.840> like<00:02:40.379> to<00:02:40.500> go<00:02:40.620> off<00:02:40.769> the<00:02:41.310> solar<00:02:41.640> is

00:02:41.899 --> 00:02:41.909 
on like to go off the solar is

00:02:41.909 --> 00:02:45.080 
on like to go off the solar is
year-round<00:02:42.739> we<00:02:43.739> do<00:02:43.890> have<00:02:44.099> a<00:02:44.129> generator<00:02:44.639> backup

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
year-round we do have a generator backup

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.780 
year-round we do have a generator backup
generator<00:02:45.720> which<00:02:46.470> gives<00:02:46.829> you<00:02:47.040> power<00:02:47.280> if<00:02:47.579> your

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
generator which gives you power if your

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:50.149 
generator which gives you power if your
you<00:02:48.780> have<00:02:48.959> five<00:02:49.200> or<00:02:49.230> six<00:02:49.560> days<00:02:49.739> of<00:02:49.980> cloudy

00:02:50.149 --> 00:02:50.159 
you have five or six days of cloudy

00:02:50.159 --> 00:02:51.680 
you have five or six days of cloudy
weather<00:02:50.430> in<00:02:50.639> Vermont<00:02:51.000> you're<00:02:51.299> gonna<00:02:51.480> need

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
weather in Vermont you're gonna need

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:55.099 
weather in Vermont you're gonna need
your<00:02:51.750> generator<00:02:52.909> but<00:02:53.909> most<00:02:54.180> of<00:02:54.329> the<00:02:54.450> year<00:02:54.690> ten

00:02:55.099 --> 00:02:55.109 
your generator but most of the year ten

00:02:55.109 --> 00:02:56.569 
your generator but most of the year ten
and<00:02:55.260> eleven<00:02:55.530> months<00:02:55.650> out<00:02:55.920> of<00:02:55.950> the<00:02:56.129> year<00:02:56.370> you've

00:02:56.569 --> 00:02:56.579 
and eleven months out of the year you've

00:02:56.579 --> 00:02:58.580 
and eleven months out of the year you've
got<00:02:56.819> solar<00:02:57.209> power<00:02:57.510> that<00:02:57.840> provides<00:02:58.170> for<00:02:58.439> all

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
got solar power that provides for all

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:02.059 
got solar power that provides for all
your<00:02:58.799> needs<00:02:59.180> so<00:03:00.180> let's<00:03:00.629> take<00:03:00.870> a<00:03:00.900> walk<00:03:01.139> over<00:03:01.590> to

00:03:02.059 --> 00:03:02.069 
your needs so let's take a walk over to

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:04.670 
your needs so let's take a walk over to
the<00:03:02.220> main<00:03:02.400> building
