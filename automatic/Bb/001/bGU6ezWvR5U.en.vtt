car well if you're eating platters

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:44.179 
car well if you're eating platters
that's<00:01:43.409> a<00:01:43.530> whole<00:01:43.680> different<00:01:44.009> thing<00:01:44.040> and

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
that's a whole different thing and

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.280 
that's a whole different thing and
that's<00:01:44.430> a<00:01:44.520> binge<00:01:44.820> it<00:01:45.240> doesn't<00:01:45.630> take<00:01:45.810> a<00:01:45.840> lot<00:01:46.170> of

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
that's a binge it doesn't take a lot of

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.590 
that's a binge it doesn't take a lot of
carbs<00:01:46.649> to<00:01:46.829> get<00:01:46.950> that<00:01:47.159> serotonin<00:01:47.820> boost<00:01:48.360> so<00:01:48.570> you

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
carbs to get that serotonin boost so you

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.330 
carbs to get that serotonin boost so you
know<00:01:48.780> it's<00:01:48.869> just<00:01:48.960> it's<00:01:49.200> a<00:01:49.350> couple<00:01:49.890> of<00:01:49.979> cups<00:01:50.189> of

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
know the entire bag and then there are

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.020 
know the entire bag and then there are
other<00:01:55.680> things<00:01:55.890> you<00:01:56.040> can<00:01:56.250> do<00:01:56.399> we<00:01:56.549> know<00:01:56.729> from<00:01:56.939> a

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
other things you can do we know from a

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.630 
other things you can do we know from a
lot<00:01:57.060> of<00:01:57.390> research<00:01:57.780> that<00:01:58.049> the<00:01:58.560> omega-3<00:01:59.310> fatty

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
lot of research that the omega-3 fatty

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.819 
lot of research that the omega-3 fatty
acids<00:02:00.210> that<00:02:00.689> you've<00:02:00.869> heard<00:02:01.079> about<00:02:01.200> you<00:02:01.740> know

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
acids that you've heard about you know

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:04.039 
acids that you've heard about you know
that<00:02:02.040> are<00:02:02.130> in<00:02:02.159> fish<00:02:02.490> right<00:02:03.000> also<00:02:03.719> not<00:02:03.930> only

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
that are in fish right also not only

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:05.330 
that are in fish right also not only
lower<00:02:04.320> your<00:02:04.409> risk<00:02:04.560> for<00:02:04.710> heart<00:02:04.890> disease<00:02:04.950> but

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
lower your risk for heart disease but

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.730 
lower your risk for heart disease but
also<00:02:05.399> boost<00:02:06.299> those<00:02:06.570> serotonin<00:02:07.259> levels<00:02:07.530> and

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
also boost those serotonin levels and

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.859 
also boost those serotonin levels and
improve<00:02:07.829> mood<00:02:08.429> and<00:02:08.670> even<00:02:08.819> thinking<00:02:09.450> ability

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
improve mood and even thinking ability

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:11.860 
improve mood and even thinking ability
so<00:02:10.470> if<00:02:10.860> you<00:02:10.979> can<00:02:11.160> have<00:02:11.310> a<00:02:11.340> little<00:02:11.580> bit<00:02:11.700> of

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:11.870 
so if you can have a little bit of

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:13.720 
so if you can have a little bit of
salmon<00:02:12.200> several<00:02:12.650> times<00:02:12.860> a<00:02:13.010> week<00:02:13.040> that's<00:02:13.430> great

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:13.730 
salmon several times a week that's great

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:15.729 
salmon several times a week that's great

afford a lot of salmon or you don't like
fish<00:02:17.810> or<00:02:18.110> whatever<00:02:18.739> then<00:02:19.310> look<00:02:19.549> for<00:02:19.760> foods

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000 
fish or whatever then look for foods

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.880 
fish or whatever then look for foods
that<00:02:20.090> are<00:02:20.269> fortified<00:02:20.810> with<00:02:20.840> what's<00:02:21.680> called

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:21.890 
that are fortified with what's called

that are fortified with what's called
algae<00:02:22.610> based<00:02:22.819> or<00:02:23.180> algal<00:02:23.690> DHA

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.010 
algae based or algal DHA

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:28.119 
algae based or algal DHA
that's<00:02:25.430> the<00:02:25.760> omega-3<00:02:26.420> DHA<00:02:26.659> that<00:02:27.440> will<00:02:27.950> help

00:02:28.119 --> 00:02:28.129 
that's the omega-3 DHA that will help

00:02:28.129 --> 00:02:29.949 
that's the omega-3 DHA that will help
boost<00:02:28.400> your<00:02:28.549> mood<00:02:28.819> and<00:02:29.090> your<00:02:29.180> memory<00:02:29.629> and<00:02:29.870> you

00:02:32.199 --> 00:02:32.209 
can find it in a variety of I actually

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:34.330 
can find it in a variety of I actually
just<00:02:32.599> saw<00:02:32.750> a<00:02:32.780> carton<00:02:33.200> of<00:02:33.290> eggs<00:02:33.409> that<00:02:33.799> said<00:02:34.069> that

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:34.340 
just saw a carton of eggs that said that

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:36.490 
just saw a carton of eggs that said that
these<00:02:34.579> eggs<00:02:34.790> were<00:02:35.030> boosted<00:02:35.540> with<00:02:35.750> omega-3

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:36.500 
these eggs were boosted with omega-3

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:38.619 
these eggs were boosted with omega-3
yeah<00:02:36.920> but<00:02:37.220> they're<00:02:37.370> not<00:02:37.519> always<00:02:37.790> the<00:02:38.060> DHA<00:02:38.569> so

00:02:38.619 --> 00:02:38.629 
yeah but they're not always the DHA so

00:02:38.629 --> 00:02:40.539 
yeah but they're not always the DHA so
that's<00:02:39.019> the<00:02:39.200> trick<00:02:39.409> you<00:02:39.530> want<00:02:39.680> that<00:02:39.920> it'll<00:02:40.340> say

00:02:40.539 --> 00:02:40.549 
that's the trick you want that it'll say

00:02:40.549 --> 00:02:41.979 
that's the trick you want that it'll say
it'll<00:02:40.790> have<00:02:40.909> a<00:02:40.940> stamp<00:02:41.299> on<00:02:41.480> the<00:02:41.569> label<00:02:41.870> like

00:02:41.979 --> 00:02:41.989 
it'll have a stamp on the label like

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:44.530 
it'll have a stamp on the label like
life's<00:02:42.290> DHA<00:02:43.069> on<00:02:43.250> it<00:02:43.430> and<00:02:43.579> that's<00:02:44.150> what<00:02:44.390> you

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:44.540 
life's DHA on it and that's what you

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:46.930 
life's DHA on it and that's what you
want<00:02:44.660> because<00:02:44.840> there's<00:02:45.230> other<00:02:45.440> omega-3s<00:02:46.190> like

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:46.940 
want because there's other omega-3s like

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:48.789 
want because there's other omega-3s like
the<00:02:47.090> omega-3s<00:02:47.569> that<00:02:47.660> you<00:02:47.840> get<00:02:47.959> in<00:02:48.079> soy<00:02:48.349> or<00:02:48.680> you

long-term<00:03:52.190> effect<00:03:52.849> now<00:03:53.690> you<00:03:53.750> can<00:03:53.989> take

00:03:54.129 --> 00:03:54.139 
long-term effect now you can take

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:19.820 
thinking turkey Turkey will not boost

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:21.759

serotonin<00:04:20.090> levels<00:04:20.780> even<00:04:20.959> though<00:04:21.109> it<00:04:21.349> contains

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:23.710 
the building block for serotonin

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:25.439 
the building block for serotonin
it's<00:04:23.860> a<00:04:24.009> protein-rich<00:04:24.580> food<00:04:25.120> and

00:04:25.439 --> 00:04:25.449 
it's a protein-rich food and

00:04:25.449 --> 00:04:28.379 
it's a protein-rich food and
protein-rich<00:04:26.289> foods<00:04:26.770> block<00:04:27.190> that<00:04:27.970> serotonin

00:04:28.379 --> 00:04:28.389 
protein-rich foods block that serotonin

00:04:28.389 --> 00:04:30.809 
protein-rich foods block that serotonin
effect<00:04:28.990> so<00:04:29.530> you<00:04:29.560> need<00:04:29.830> the<00:04:29.949> all<00:04:30.100> carbs<00:04:30.490> snack

00:04:30.809 --> 00:04:30.819 
effect so you need the all carbs snack

00:04:30.819 --> 00:04:32.159 
effect so you need the all carbs snack
to<00:04:31.000> get<00:04:31.150> there<00:04:31.300> well<00:04:31.660> I<00:04:31.690> think<00:04:31.900> it's

00:04:32.159 --> 00:04:32.169 
to get there well I think it's

00:04:32.169 --> 00:04:34.140 
to get there well I think it's
interesting<00:04:32.349> that<00:04:32.740> foods<00:04:33.280> actually<00:04:33.880> can

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:34.150 
interesting that foods actually can

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:36.120 
interesting that foods actually can
affect<00:04:34.449> your<00:04:34.569> mood<00:04:34.750> to<00:04:34.990> the<00:04:35.110> extent<00:04:35.500> that<00:04:35.740> you

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:36.130 
affect your mood to the extent that you

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:38.370 
affect your mood to the extent that you
say<00:04:36.400> they<00:04:36.580> can<00:04:36.819> oh<00:04:37.090> because<00:04:37.630> I<00:04:37.840> think<00:04:37.900> again

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:38.380 
say they can oh because I think again

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:40.830 
say they can oh because I think again
with<00:04:38.770> mindless<00:04:39.160> eating<00:04:39.430> we<00:04:40.090> don't<00:04:40.360> realize

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:40.840 
with mindless eating we don't realize

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:43.589 
with mindless eating we don't realize
that<00:04:40.870> we're<00:04:41.229> also<00:04:41.849> going<00:04:42.849> up<00:04:43.060> going<00:04:43.419> down

00:04:43.589 --> 00:04:43.599 
that we're also going up going down

00:04:43.599 --> 00:04:45.270 
that we're also going up going down
going<00:04:43.810> up<00:04:44.020> going<00:04:44.289> down<00:04:44.410> you<00:04:44.979> know<00:04:45.069> I<00:04:45.099> think

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:45.280 
going up going down you know I think

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:47.040 
going up going down you know I think
most<00:04:45.639> people<00:04:45.789> know<00:04:46.030> that<00:04:46.060> if<00:04:46.300> they<00:04:46.419> don't<00:04:46.630> get

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:47.050 
most people know that if they don't get

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:48.570 
most people know that if they don't get
enough<00:04:47.319> calcium<00:04:47.560> that<00:04:47.979> over<00:04:48.190> the<00:04:48.280> course<00:04:48.400> of

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:48.580 
enough calcium that over the course of

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:50.730 
enough calcium that over the course of
decades<00:04:48.669> it'll<00:04:49.150> lead<00:04:49.449> to<00:04:49.569> osteoporosis<00:04:49.870> or<00:04:50.680> if

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:50.740 
decades it'll lead to osteoporosis or if

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:52.740 
decades it'll lead to osteoporosis or if
they<00:04:50.830> eat<00:04:50.979> too<00:04:51.009> much<00:04:51.310> saturated<00:04:51.880> fat<00:04:52.300> that

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:52.750 
they eat too much saturated fat that

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:54.659 
they eat too much saturated fat that
they<00:04:52.870> may<00:04:53.020> someday<00:04:53.410> down<00:04:53.949> the<00:04:54.009> road<00:04:54.190> end<00:04:54.580> up

00:04:54.659 --> 00:04:54.669 
they may someday down the road end up

00:04:54.669 --> 00:04:56.820 
they may someday down the road end up
with<00:04:54.789> heart<00:04:54.970> disease<00:04:55.270> but<00:04:55.960> the<00:04:56.349> link<00:04:56.650> with

with heart disease but the link with
food<00:04:57.070> and<00:04:57.250> mood<00:04:57.430> is<00:04:57.550> much<00:04:58.000> more<00:04:58.240> immediate
