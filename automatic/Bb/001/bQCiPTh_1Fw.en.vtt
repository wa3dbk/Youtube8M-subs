that<00:00:15.260> if<00:00:16.260> you<00:00:16.440> remember<00:00:16.770> last<00:00:17.220> parts<00:00:17.699> I<00:00:17.940> killed

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
that if you remember last parts I killed

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:21.230 
that if you remember last parts I killed
the<00:00:18.539> armored<00:00:18.869> cannon<00:00:19.260> beetle<00:00:19.699> but<00:00:20.699> I<00:00:20.730> did<00:00:21.060> not

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
the armored cannon beetle but I did not

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.269 
the armored cannon beetle but I did not
have<00:00:21.449> enough<00:00:21.630> time<00:00:21.869> to<00:00:21.930> get<00:00:22.199> the<00:00:22.560> part<00:00:22.859> that<00:00:23.189> he

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
have enough time to get the part that he

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:25.250 
have enough time to get the part that he
was<00:00:23.430> guarding<00:00:23.670> back<00:00:24.029> to<00:00:24.210> the<00:00:24.330> ship<00:00:24.600> so<00:00:24.900> we<00:00:25.080> have

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
was guarding back to the ship so we have

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.410 
was guarding back to the ship so we have
to<00:00:25.410> waste<00:00:25.590> an<00:00:25.800> entire<00:00:25.890> day<00:00:26.550> going<00:00:26.970> back<00:00:27.180> to<00:00:27.330> the

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
to waste an entire day going back to the

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.210 
to waste an entire day going back to the
forest<00:00:27.689> of<00:00:27.869> hope<00:00:28.050> all<00:00:28.320> to<00:00:28.500> pick<00:00:28.680> up<00:00:28.830> a<00:00:28.920> measly

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
forest of hope all to pick up a measly

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:34.639 
forest of hope all to pick up a measly
ship<00:00:29.670> parts<00:00:31.099> so<00:00:32.099> essentially<00:00:33.110> we're<00:00:34.110> wasting

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
ship parts so essentially we're wasting

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:37.790 
ship parts so essentially we're wasting
an<00:00:34.829> entire<00:00:35.100> day<00:00:35.510> for<00:00:36.510> something<00:00:36.870> we<00:00:37.260> can<00:00:37.440> do<00:00:37.620> in

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
an entire day for something we can do in

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.700 
an entire day for something we can do in
like<00:00:38.070> two<00:00:38.280> seconds<00:00:39.079> let<00:00:40.079> me<00:00:40.170> see<00:00:40.379> we<00:00:40.530> already

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
like two seconds let me see we already

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.910 
like two seconds let me see we already
got<00:00:41.070> it<00:00:41.160> pretty<00:00:41.399> damn<00:00:41.610> close<00:00:41.910> to<00:00:41.969> the<00:00:42.239> ship<00:00:42.300> so

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:42.920 
got it pretty damn close to the ship so

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:45.290 
got it pretty damn close to the ship so
yeah<00:00:43.920> let's<00:00:44.129> just<00:00:44.160> get<00:00:44.399> the<00:00:44.550> pigment<00:00:44.969> to<00:00:45.059> carry

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
yeah let's just get the pigment to carry

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.340 
yeah let's just get the pigment to carry
that<00:00:45.510> thing<00:00:46.489> then<00:00:47.489> we'll<00:00:47.850> see<00:00:48.149> what<00:00:48.450> we<00:00:49.050> are

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
that thing then we'll see what we are

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:55.900 
that thing then we'll see what we are
going<00:00:49.860> to<00:00:49.980> do<00:00:50.870> radiation<00:00:51.870> canopy<00:00:52.530> yadda<00:00:54.320> and

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:55.910 
going to do radiation canopy yadda and

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:00.410 
going to do radiation canopy yadda and
some<00:00:56.910> of<00:00:56.940> them<00:00:57.329> do<00:00:57.780> not<00:00:57.809> want<00:00:58.260> to<00:00:58.320> work<00:00:58.620> so<00:00:59.420> yeah

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
insubordination but at least we get the

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.620 
insubordination but at least we get the
radiation<00:01:06.510> canopy<00:01:06.990> back<00:01:07.200> to<00:01:07.380> the<00:01:07.500> ship<00:01:07.799> and<00:01:08.630> it

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
radiation canopy back to the ship and it

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.100 
radiation canopy back to the ship and it
fits<00:01:09.960> right<00:01:10.260> over<00:01:10.320> the<00:01:10.650> pilot<00:01:11.040> seat<00:01:11.220> so<00:01:11.610> yay

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:12.110 
fits right over the pilot seat so yay

fits right over the pilot seat so yay
I'll<00:01:13.110> have<00:01:13.290> to<00:01:13.470> inspect<00:01:13.680> it<00:01:13.979> later<00:01:14.189> to<00:01:14.369> make

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
I'll have to inspect it later to make

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.399 
I'll have to inspect it later to make
sure<00:01:14.670> it<00:01:14.820> hasn't<00:01:14.970> cracked<00:01:15.420> I'll<00:01:15.840> be<00:01:16.080> in<00:01:16.170> for

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.050 
even more trouble if i have any
radiation<00:01:17.970> leaks<00:01:18.920> I've<00:01:19.920> never<00:01:20.130> covered<00:01:20.520> 19

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
radiation leaks I've never covered 19

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.289 
radiation leaks I've never covered 19
parts<00:01:21.509> if<00:01:22.049> I<00:01:22.290> can<00:01:22.530> just<00:01:23.340> find<00:01:23.549> 10<00:01:23.850> more<00:01:23.880> should

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
parts if I can just find 10 more should

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:25.280 
parts if I can just find 10 more should
be<00:01:24.330> able<00:01:24.479> to<00:01:24.659> increase<00:01:24.840> my<00:01:25.080> shift

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.819 
awesome job so yeah let's just stuff the
pigment<00:01:34.530> back<00:01:34.740> in<00:01:34.950> the<00:01:35.130> onion<00:01:36.829> because

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
pigment back in the onion because

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:40.910 
pigment back in the onion because
they're<00:01:38.250> annoying<00:01:38.579> and<00:01:39.320> then<00:01:40.320> I'll<00:01:40.439> just<00:01:40.590> go

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
they're annoying and then I'll just go

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.429 
they're annoying and then I'll just go
and<00:01:41.119> have<00:01:42.119> a<00:01:42.150> little<00:01:42.479> run<00:01:42.659> around<00:01:42.960> on<00:01:43.110> the<00:01:43.259> map

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
and have a little run around on the map

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.319 
and have a little run around on the map
see<00:01:43.649> if<00:01:43.740> there's<00:01:43.920> anything<00:01:44.310> for<00:01:44.729> us<00:01:44.759> to<00:01:45.030> do

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
see if there's anything for us to do

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:49.880 
see if there's anything for us to do
here<00:01:47.570> okay<00:01:48.570> there's<00:01:48.750> a<00:01:48.810> bulb<00:01:49.110> orb<00:01:49.380> so<00:01:49.590> at<00:01:49.770> least

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
here okay there's a bulb orb so at least

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.249 
here okay there's a bulb orb so at least
we<00:01:50.070> can<00:01:50.220> like<00:01:51.060> make<00:01:51.299> some<00:01:51.540> more<00:01:51.659> pigment<00:01:52.110> and

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
we can like make some more pigment and

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:55.550 
we can like make some more pigment and
according<00:01:52.770> to<00:01:52.799> the<00:01:53.600> numbers<00:01:54.600> in<00:01:54.810> the<00:01:54.960> lower

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
according to the numbers in the lower

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.980 
according to the numbers in the lower
right<00:01:55.920> there<00:01:56.640> should<00:01:56.939> still<00:01:57.000> be<00:01:57.270> a<00:01:57.509> Pikmin

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
right there should still be a Pikmin

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.160 
right there should still be a Pikmin
here<00:01:58.110> somewhere<00:01:58.530> and<00:01:58.770> I<00:01:59.729> have<00:02:00.030> some<00:02:00.390> ideas<00:02:00.899> of

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
here somewhere and I have some ideas of

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.569 
here somewhere and I have some ideas of
where<00:02:01.770> that<00:02:02.009> could<00:02:02.490> possibly<00:02:02.909> be<00:02:04.219> because<00:02:05.219> if

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
where that could possibly be because if

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:08.540 
where that could possibly be because if
you<00:02:05.700> remember<00:02:06.140> we<00:02:07.140> lost<00:02:07.469> quite<00:02:07.770> a<00:02:07.829> few<00:02:07.950> Pikmin

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
you remember we lost quite a few Pikmin

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.669 
you remember we lost quite a few Pikmin
when<00:02:08.729> fighting<00:02:09.000> the<00:02:09.179> burrowing<00:02:09.840> snaggart<00:02:10.500> and

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
when fighting the burrowing snaggart and

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:11.990 
when fighting the burrowing snaggart and
the<00:02:10.770> armored<00:02:11.099> cannon<00:02:11.459> beetle<00:02:11.640> in<00:02:11.910> the

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
the armored cannon beetle in the

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.960 
the armored cannon beetle in the
previous<00:02:12.300> parts

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:12.970 
previous parts
