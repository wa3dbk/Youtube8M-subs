00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.720

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.299

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.340
 the routes then strategic 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:52.799
 be evaluated and then maybe 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:56.280

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:09.420
 comments is huge and you can see comments 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.310
 then they take this 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:14.819

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:16.319

 key moment bowl straight at me 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:32.250
 sure every case the key job 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:34.650
 parade was increased the boxes glitches 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:37.410

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:44.850
 to fix exotic foray that is 

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:46.890
 if you do not have room in the 

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:49.230
