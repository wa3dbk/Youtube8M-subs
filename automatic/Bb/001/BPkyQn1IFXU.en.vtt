when<00:01:23.530> it<00:01:23.560> comes<00:01:23.890> to<00:01:24.130> the<00:01:24.910> things<00:01:25.209> that<00:01:25.360> it

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:25.450 
when it comes to the things that it

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:27.449 
when it comes to the things that it
calls<00:01:25.660> what<00:01:25.899> it<00:01:25.990> doesn't<00:01:26.170> call<00:01:26.440> but<00:01:26.770> you<00:01:27.369> know

00:01:27.449 --> 00:01:27.459 
calls what it doesn't call but you know

00:01:27.459 --> 00:01:29.219 
calls what it doesn't call but you know
how<00:01:27.610> it<00:01:27.729> goes<00:01:27.940> I<00:01:28.240> mean<00:01:28.420> he<00:01:28.869> could<00:01:29.050> get

00:01:29.219 --> 00:01:29.229 
how it goes I mean he could get

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:30.600 
how it goes I mean he could get
suspended<00:01:29.319> it<00:01:29.860> could<00:01:30.039> just<00:01:30.190> be<00:01:30.310> a<00:01:30.340> fine

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:30.610 
suspended it could just be a fine

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:33.180 
suspended it could just be a fine
whatever<00:01:30.849> it<00:01:31.090> is<00:01:31.209> but<00:01:31.920> it's<00:01:32.920> a<00:01:33.069> learning

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:33.190 
whatever it is but it's a learning

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:35.190 
whatever it is but it's a learning
experience<00:01:33.429> for<00:01:33.940> him<00:01:34.090> next<00:01:34.750> time<00:01:34.929> he<00:01:35.080> probably

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:35.200 
experience for him next time he probably

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.080 
experience for him next time he probably
won't<00:01:35.470> do<00:01:35.679> that<00:01:35.860> if<00:01:36.069> he<00:01:36.310> wins<00:01:36.429> that's<00:01:36.759> me<00:01:36.910> right

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:37.090 
won't do that if he wins that's me right

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:39.389 
won't do that if he wins that's me right
there<00:01:37.330> but<00:01:38.050> it's<00:01:38.619> just<00:01:38.709> the<00:01:38.920> fact<00:01:39.130> that<00:01:39.190> I'm<00:01:39.340> a
