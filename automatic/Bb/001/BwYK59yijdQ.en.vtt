00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:09.959
 welcome today I will show you how to get 

00:00:05.049 --> 00:00:12.369
 infinite mercury on battleship 

00:00:09.959 --> 00:00:17.910
 first let's see, let's make sure 

00:00:12.369 --> 00:00:17.910
 wrap then we go to settings 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.410
 General Settings 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:36.730
 let's take sweating excuse date and time later 

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:40.710
 let's go up if we have it 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:40.710
 automatic timetable 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:55.950
 we go day ahead we close we go 

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:55.950
 su batte ship 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:08.210
 expect the game dog here is how 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.210
 see we have a new key 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:18.060
 we maybe see if that's okay not 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:21.869
 it went well let's do it again let's close 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:24.600
 lot you see we give the keys we remember 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:26.220
 that was the trick you'll have one 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.399
 a day but with this trick you see 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:36.000
 cern and how many you want we keep that 

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:43.619
 charge the new game we have 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:47.670
 found a shield of 22 shields then 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:51.289
 I will have a shield of three days and two 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.289
 days or seven hours 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:57.030
 maybe we see each other again with mercury 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:59.310
 so I'll show you this 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:03.210
 trick and I got the third one 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:06.899
 fourth and fifth mason I must say I am 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:11.570
 very useful to make progress with 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:11.570
 game we remember from the end of August 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:22.170
 now they are not well that they could not find 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:26.489
 in the heart you see it I am level 30 a 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:28.440
 part of a video that I have to rebuild 

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:33.440
 I just defended very high indeed 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:36.239
 thanks to that to make mercury to the masons 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:40.049
 we see 

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:43.320
 no I can't find the mercury now 

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:50.160
 100,000 lava can also occur 

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:52.170
 100,000 solid settler diamonds happen 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:56.430
 only 25 thousand and Wednesday instead of 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:03:00.840
 rome portions of 20 rarely if any 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:05.329
 they also find 50 as you see I found 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:05.329
 just 25 thousand diamonds 

00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:16.530
 we must beat the twin bc game 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:21.209
 clash of plants whose advice 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:24.120
 surely to play it I tend to see if 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:27.959
 okay at least this time no 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:40.470
 still no I can't find it there 

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:46.410
 we close the net now 81 mercury we take 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:51.520
 I don't find that loads 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:59.820
 possible days I find it very much 

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:59.820
 I often mean that what the game is about 

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:12.820
 here is the mercury 20 usually if any 

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:16.989
 they rarely find those from 50 

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:18.700
 as you see now or 101 mercury vi 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:19.930
 I recommend using it especially 

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:22.870
 to tell the truth that you are very 

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:31.480
 ambitious you see the barracks of five 

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:33.960
 masons through early commented 

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:33.960
 possibly
