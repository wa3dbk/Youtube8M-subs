that<00:02:00.390> one<00:02:00.600> then<00:02:00.930> two<00:02:01.200> little<00:02:01.409> LED<00:02:01.799> blinkers<00:02:02.790> on

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
that one then two little LED blinkers on

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:06.910 
that one then two little LED blinkers on
there<00:02:03.350> and<00:02:04.350> I<00:02:04.880> also<00:02:05.880> got<00:02:06.210> these<00:02:06.360> these<00:02:06.630> are<00:02:06.780> a

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:06.920 
there and I also got these these are a

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.380 
there and I also got these these are a
power-mad<00:02:07.920> makes<00:02:08.550> these<00:02:08.700> mirrors<00:02:09.090> so<00:02:09.119> that

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
power-mad makes these mirrors so that

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.770 
power-mad makes these mirrors so that
made<00:02:09.599> for<00:02:09.869> the<00:02:09.989> zetas<00:02:11.300> handguards<00:02:12.300> but<00:02:12.660> you

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
made for the zetas handguards but you

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:14.150 
made for the zetas handguards but you
can<00:02:12.959> just<00:02:13.110> run<00:02:13.290> a<00:02:13.319> little<00:02:13.470> bit<00:02:13.620> long

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 
can just run a little bit long

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.100 
can just run a little bit long
screw<00:02:14.910> through<00:02:15.150> there<00:02:15.330> and<00:02:15.540> stick<00:02:15.810> them<00:02:15.960> on

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
screw through there and stick them on

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:19.760 
screw through there and stick them on
and<00:02:16.610> those<00:02:17.610> will<00:02:17.760> fold<00:02:17.940> down<00:02:18.350> back<00:02:19.350> behind<00:02:19.560> the

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:19.770 
and those will fold down back behind the

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:21.080 
and those will fold down back behind the
hand<00:02:19.950> guards<00:02:20.190> if<00:02:20.340> you<00:02:20.430> have<00:02:20.520> further<00:02:20.730> whatever

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
hand guards if you have further whatever

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:23.270 
hand guards if you have further whatever
but<00:02:21.959> they're<00:02:22.050> pretty<00:02:22.230> kind<00:02:22.650> of<00:02:22.770> minimalist

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
but they're pretty kind of minimalist

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.490 
but they're pretty kind of minimalist
low-profile<00:02:24.090> mirrors<00:02:24.510> and<00:02:25.080> like<00:02:25.230> from<00:02:25.410> the

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
low-profile mirrors and like from the

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.650 
low-profile mirrors and like from the
front<00:02:25.680> you<00:02:26.010> don't<00:02:26.220> they<00:02:27.090> don't<00:02:27.180> stick<00:02:27.510> up

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
front you don't they don't stick up

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:29.330 
front you don't they don't stick up
clear<00:02:28.020> up<00:02:28.200> like<00:02:28.470> you<00:02:28.620> know<00:02:28.740> the<00:02:28.920> big<00:02:29.040> stock

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
clear up like you know the big stock

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:32.060 
clear up like you know the big stock
ones<00:02:29.610> do<00:02:29.880> now<00:02:30.750> you<00:02:31.020> can<00:02:31.170> see<00:02:31.350> decent<00:02:31.590> out<00:02:31.950> of

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:32.070 
ones do now you can see decent out of

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:33.590 
ones do now you can see decent out of
there<00:02:32.190> mostly<00:02:32.850> you<00:02:33.030> see<00:02:33.209> kind<00:02:33.420> of<00:02:33.510> your

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:33.600 
there mostly you see kind of your

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:34.820 
there mostly you see kind of your
shoulder<00:02:34.020> and<00:02:34.110> you<00:02:34.200> kind<00:02:34.350> of<00:02:34.380> got<00:02:34.500> to<00:02:34.590> lean<00:02:34.740> out

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830 
shoulder and you kind of got to lean out

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:37.100 
shoulder and you kind of got to lean out
a<00:02:34.890> little<00:02:35.160> bit<00:02:35.280> to<00:02:35.430> see<00:02:35.640> but<00:02:35.880> I<00:02:36.120> do<00:02:36.510> like<00:02:36.840> having

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
a little bit to see but I do like having

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:39.080 
a little bit to see but I do like having
mirrors<00:02:37.470> I<00:02:37.650> don't<00:02:37.830> I<00:02:37.980> only<00:02:38.100> had<00:02:38.280> that<00:02:38.430> long<00:02:38.670> he

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
mirrors I don't I only had that long he

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:42.920 
mirrors I don't I only had that long he
had<00:02:39.209> a<00:02:39.240> little<00:02:41.180> underbar<00:02:42.180> mirror<00:02:42.570> kind<00:02:42.780> of

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
had a little underbar mirror kind of

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:46.729 
had a little underbar mirror kind of
here<00:02:43.200> and<00:02:43.770> it<00:02:44.730> was<00:02:44.930> cheap<00:02:45.930> and<00:02:46.170> loose<00:02:46.380> and<00:02:46.590> it

00:02:46.729 --> 00:02:46.739 
here and it was cheap and loose and it

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:48.020 
here and it was cheap and loose and it
ride<00:02:46.890> around<00:02:47.010> all<00:02:47.280> the<00:02:47.370> time<00:02:47.580> I<00:02:47.730> could<00:02:47.790> never

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
ride around all the time I could never

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:50.240 
ride around all the time I could never
use<00:02:48.450> it<00:02:48.570> anyways<00:02:48.959> and<00:02:49.230> it's<00:02:49.980> got<00:02:50.100> different

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
use it anyways and it's got different

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:55.400 
use it anyways and it's got different
grips<00:02:50.670> and<00:02:51.030> a<00:02:51.380> sv<00:02:52.380> levers<00:02:52.769> on<00:02:52.980> it<00:02:54.170> but<00:02:55.170> I<00:02:55.230> rent

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410 
grips and a sv levers on it but I rent

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:57.470 
grips and a sv levers on it but I rent
one<00:02:55.470> probably<00:02:55.860> right<00:02:56.010> into<00:02:56.250> with<00:02:56.400> the<00:02:56.640> so<00:02:57.209> I'm

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
one probably right into with the so I'm

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.780 
one probably right into with the so I'm
guessing<00:02:57.780> I<00:02:57.900> took<00:02:58.080> this<00:02:58.200> off<00:02:58.410> was<00:02:58.650> on<00:02:59.100> the<00:02:59.550> the

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 
guessing I took this off was on the the

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:02.090 
guessing I took this off was on the the
levers<00:03:00.120> there's<00:03:00.390> a<00:03:00.450> little<00:03:00.720> there's<00:03:01.650> a<00:03:01.709> kind

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:02.100 
levers there's a little there's a kind

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:03.640 
levers there's a little there's a kind
of<00:03:02.130> a<00:03:02.250> nut<00:03:02.459> right<00:03:02.489> here<00:03:02.700> at<00:03:02.910> the<00:03:03.000> setscrew

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:03.650 
of a nut right here at the setscrew

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:06.740 
of a nut right here at the setscrew
like<00:03:04.650> that<00:03:04.830> one<00:03:05.040> but<00:03:05.820> I<00:03:05.880> took<00:03:06.150> this<00:03:06.420> one<00:03:06.600> off

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
like that one but I took this one off

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:09.740 
like that one but I took this one off
I'm<00:03:06.959> just<00:03:07.140> put<00:03:07.320> a<00:03:07.350> stainless<00:03:08.390> screw<00:03:09.390> in<00:03:09.540> there

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
I'm just put a stainless screw in there

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:11.870 
I'm just put a stainless screw in there
and<00:03:09.900> then<00:03:09.989> kind<00:03:10.230> of<00:03:10.350> ground<00:03:10.980> the<00:03:11.070> bolt<00:03:11.280> down<00:03:11.459> so

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:11.880 
and then kind of ground the bolt down so

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:14.780 
and then kind of ground the bolt down so
it<00:03:12.000> cuz<00:03:12.630> it<00:03:12.810> hit<00:03:13.350> on<00:03:13.500> this<00:03:13.650> housing<00:03:14.100> actually

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790 
it cuz it hit on this housing actually

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:17.030 
it cuz it hit on this housing actually
heated<00:03:15.269> it<00:03:15.450> up<00:03:15.570> and<00:03:15.630> then<00:03:16.500> just<00:03:16.620> pulled<00:03:16.920> this

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 
heated it up and then just pulled this

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:18.530 
heated it up and then just pulled this
into<00:03:17.250> him<00:03:17.340> kind<00:03:17.519> of<00:03:17.550> melted<00:03:17.910> a<00:03:18.000> divot<00:03:18.299> into

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 
into him kind of melted a divot into

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:19.699 
into him kind of melted a divot into
there<00:03:18.660> so<00:03:18.840> it<00:03:18.900> would<00:03:18.989> have<00:03:19.110> a<00:03:19.170> spot<00:03:19.470> for<00:03:19.500> the

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:19.709 
there so it would have a spot for the

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:26.420 
there so it would have a spot for the
clutch<00:03:19.890> to<00:03:20.209> actually<00:03:21.209> work<00:03:25.040> one<00:03:26.040> more<00:03:26.220> thing

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
clutch to actually work one more thing

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:30.830 
clutch to actually work one more thing
that<00:03:26.459> I<00:03:26.670> added<00:03:27.239> was<00:03:27.480> this<00:03:28.310> that<00:03:29.310> a<00:03:29.840> carbon

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:30.840 
that I added was this that a carbon

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:33.620 
that I added was this that a carbon
fiber<00:03:31.170> exhaust<00:03:31.620> shield<00:03:32.360> actually<00:03:33.360> just

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:33.630 
fiber exhaust shield actually just

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:34.880 
fiber exhaust shield actually just
riding<00:03:33.900> it<00:03:33.989> when<00:03:34.110> it<00:03:34.200> was<00:03:34.290> cold<00:03:34.560> out<00:03:34.709> and<00:03:34.799> had

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:34.890 
riding it when it was cold out and had

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:36.740 
riding it when it was cold out and had
coveralls<00:03:35.310> on<00:03:35.489> and<00:03:35.700> I<00:03:35.760> kind<00:03:36.060> of<00:03:36.150> melted<00:03:36.480> him<00:03:36.630> on

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:36.750 
coveralls on and I kind of melted him on

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:39.350 
coveralls on and I kind of melted him on
the<00:03:36.870> head<00:03:37.019> over<00:03:37.170> there<00:03:37.380> but<00:03:38.310> I<00:03:38.340> had<00:03:38.970> that<00:03:39.209> on

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:39.360 
the head over there but I had that on

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:41.270 
the head over there but I had that on
there<00:03:39.510> it<00:03:39.630> looks<00:03:39.810> pretty<00:03:40.079> nice<00:03:40.200> and<00:03:40.590> actually

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 
there it looks pretty nice and actually

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:44.360 
there it looks pretty nice and actually
it<00:03:41.340> works<00:03:41.519> so<00:03:42.560> i'm<00:03:43.560> playing<00:03:43.769> i'm<00:03:43.890> doing<00:03:44.190> now<00:03:44.220> is

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:44.370 
it works so i'm playing i'm doing now is

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:46.850 
it works so i'm playing i'm doing now is
it<00:03:45.180> needs<00:03:45.299> to<00:03:45.420> be<00:03:45.540> jetted<00:03:45.959> he's<00:03:46.200> got<00:03:46.440> the<00:03:46.650> we

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:51.680 
did the air box mod and has a different
filter<00:03:49.829> on<00:03:50.160> it<00:03:50.340> so<00:03:50.549> that's<00:03:50.760> let<00:03:51.060> more<00:03:51.269> air<00:03:51.299> in

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:51.690 
filter on it so that's let more air in

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:54.020 
filter on it so that's let more air in
we<00:03:52.290> got<00:03:52.440> the<00:03:52.560> exhaust<00:03:52.739> let<00:03:53.040> more<00:03:53.220> air<00:03:53.250> out<00:03:53.549> but

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:54.030 
we got the exhaust let more air out but

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:55.630 
we got the exhaust let more air out but
we're<00:03:54.269> not<00:03:54.420> getting<00:03:54.540> more<00:03:54.900> fuel<00:03:55.170> because<00:03:55.440> it's

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:55.640 
we're not getting more fuel because it's

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:58.490 
we're not getting more fuel because it's
pretty<00:03:56.640> sure<00:03:56.820> he<00:03:57.090> said<00:03:57.360> the<00:03:57.600> previous<00:03:58.290> owner

00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:58.500 
pretty sure he said the previous owner

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:00.590 
pretty sure he said the previous owner
said<00:03:58.709> that<00:03:58.860> it's<00:03:59.040> hasn't<00:03:59.940> been<00:04:00.030> jetted<00:04:00.390> so

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:00.600 
said that it's hasn't been jetted so

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:04.310 
said that it's hasn't been jetted so
that's<00:04:01.530> the<00:04:01.680> next<00:04:02.010> thing<00:04:02.579> on<00:04:02.730> the<00:04:02.790> list<00:04:03.320> then

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:04.320 
that's the next thing on the list then

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:05.660 
that's the next thing on the list then
i'm<00:04:04.500> playing<00:04:04.860> it<00:04:04.950> on<00:04:05.070> probably<00:04:05.489> some

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:05.670 
i'm playing it on probably some

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:07.370 
i'm playing it on probably some
different<00:04:05.970> tires<00:04:06.180> I<00:04:06.450> live<00:04:06.630> on<00:04:06.780> gravel<00:04:07.200> and

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:07.380 
different tires I live on gravel and

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:10.310 
different tires I live on gravel and
ride<00:04:08.010> decent<00:04:08.459> amount<00:04:08.670> on<00:04:09.540> gravel<00:04:09.930> and<00:04:10.049> offroad

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:10.320 
ride decent amount on gravel and offroad

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:16.039 
ride decent amount on gravel and offroad
so<00:04:11.000> those<00:04:12.000> are<00:04:12.209> the<00:04:12.739> battle-ax<00:04:13.739> ones<00:04:14.720> and<00:04:15.720> I

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:16.049 
so those are the battle-ax ones and I

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:17.870 
so those are the battle-ax ones and I
mean<00:04:16.470> the<00:04:16.560> good<00:04:16.709> on-road<00:04:17.100> but<00:04:17.400> I've<00:04:17.609> kind<00:04:17.789> of

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:17.880 
mean the good on-road but I've kind of

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:20.960 
mean the good on-road but I've kind of
like<00:04:18.000> more<00:04:18.150> of<00:04:18.209> a<00:04:18.359> 50/50<00:04:18.840> tire<00:04:19.260> and<00:04:19.829> then<00:04:20.519> if<00:04:20.850> I

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:20.970 
like more of a 50/50 tire and then if I

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:22.909 
like more of a 50/50 tire and then if I
do<00:04:21.030> that<00:04:21.479> I'm<00:04:21.750> probably<00:04:22.049> gonna<00:04:22.349> change<00:04:22.710> the

00:04:22.909 --> 00:04:22.919 
do that I'm probably gonna change the

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:25.559 
do that I'm probably gonna change the
gearing<00:04:23.160> back<00:04:23.460> to<00:04:23.669> stock<00:04:24.000> he's<00:04:24.330> got

00:04:25.559 --> 00:04:25.569 
gearing back to stock he's got

00:04:25.569 --> 00:04:27.330 
gearing back to stock he's got
I<00:04:25.599> think<00:04:25.990> you<00:04:26.080> went<00:04:26.169> down<00:04:26.469> a<00:04:26.500> couple<00:04:26.979> teeth<00:04:27.189> and

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:27.340 
I think you went down a couple teeth and

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:29.369 
I think you went down a couple teeth and
I<00:04:27.370> guess<00:04:27.550> the<00:04:27.669> thirty-nine<00:04:28.090> tooth<00:04:28.360> in<00:04:29.229> the

00:04:29.369 --> 00:04:29.379 
I guess the thirty-nine tooth in the

00:04:29.379 --> 00:04:31.499 
I guess the thirty-nine tooth in the
back<00:04:29.710> I<00:04:30.099> can't<00:04:30.610> remember<00:04:30.789> for<00:04:31.060> sure<00:04:31.090> what<00:04:31.389> was

00:04:31.499 --> 00:04:31.509 
back I can't remember for sure what was

00:04:31.509 --> 00:04:34.800 
back I can't remember for sure what was
on<00:04:31.629> there<00:04:31.840> but<00:04:32.710> it's<00:04:33.370> a<00:04:33.849> little<00:04:34.120> less<00:04:34.330> torque<00:04:34.689> a

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:34.810 
on there but it's a little less torque a

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:37.939 
on there but it's a little less torque a
little<00:04:35.020> more<00:04:35.139> speed<00:04:35.409> on<00:04:35.469> that<00:04:35.830> one<00:04:36.009> I<00:04:36.780> mean

00:04:37.939 --> 00:04:37.949 
little more speed on that one I mean

00:04:37.949 --> 00:04:40.050 
little more speed on that one I mean
like<00:04:38.949> I<00:04:39.069> said<00:04:39.129> I<00:04:39.280> haven't<00:04:39.490> decided<00:04:39.789> what<00:04:39.939> I

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:40.060 
like I said I haven't decided what I

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:42.990 
like I said I haven't decided what I
want<00:04:40.210> to<00:04:40.270> do<00:04:40.389> with<00:04:40.569> the<00:04:41.250> graphics<00:04:42.250> kit<00:04:42.490> yet<00:04:42.729> I

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:43.000 
want to do with the graphics kit yet I

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.179 
want to do with the graphics kit yet I
like<00:04:43.750> I<00:04:43.930> think<00:04:44.259> I<00:04:44.349> like<00:04:44.530> it<00:04:44.560> except<00:04:44.949> for<00:04:44.979> this

00:04:45.179 --> 00:04:45.189 
like I think I like it except for this

00:04:45.189 --> 00:04:46.800 
like I think I like it except for this
big<00:04:45.490> red<00:04:45.729> number<00:04:46.060> on<00:04:46.210> there<00:04:46.360> I'm<00:04:46.449> not<00:04:46.509> really<00:04:46.689> a

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:46.810 
big red number on there I'm not really a

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:49.980 
big red number on there I'm not really a
fan<00:04:46.930> of<00:04:46.990> that<00:04:47.289> but<00:04:48.090> not<00:04:49.090> too<00:04:49.240> much<00:04:49.389> issue<00:04:49.629> I'm

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:49.990 
fan of that but not too much issue I'm

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:51.629 
fan of that but not too much issue I'm
kind<00:04:50.229> of<00:04:50.259> debating<00:04:50.379> on<00:04:50.740> the<00:04:50.860> on<00:04:51.159> a<00:04:51.219> headlight

00:04:51.629 --> 00:04:51.639 
kind of debating on the on a headlight

00:04:59.809 --> 00:04:59.819 
and he's got that trail tech alone

00:04:59.819 --> 00:05:02.459 
and he's got that trail tech alone
outside<00:05:00.819> of<00:05:01.180> it<00:05:01.330> if<00:05:01.539> I<00:05:01.659> like<00:05:01.840> the<00:05:02.020> looks<00:05:02.259> of<00:05:02.409> it

00:05:02.459 --> 00:05:02.469 
outside of it if I like the looks of it

00:05:02.469 --> 00:05:03.600 
outside of it if I like the looks of it
or<00:05:03.129> not

yet<00:05:03.819> it<00:05:04.120> definitely<00:05:04.840> works<00:05:05.080> better<00:05:05.349> and

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:05.680 
yet it definitely works better and

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:08.459 
yet it definitely works better and
throws<00:05:05.860> farther<00:05:06.250> and<00:05:06.490> that's<00:05:06.789> nice<00:05:07.029> but<00:05:07.469> this

00:05:08.459 --> 00:05:08.469 
throws farther and that's nice but this

00:05:08.469 --> 00:05:09.899 
throws farther and that's nice but this
is<00:05:08.680> kind<00:05:08.860> of<00:05:08.889> a<00:05:08.979> work<00:05:09.099> in<00:05:09.129> progress<00:05:09.430> right<00:05:09.819> now

00:05:09.899 --> 00:05:09.909

00:05:29.959 --> 00:05:29.969 
but they're they're definitely fun bites

00:05:29.969 --> 00:05:32.159 
but they're they're definitely fun bites
and<00:05:30.969> this<00:05:31.060> is<00:05:31.180> why<00:05:31.330> I<00:05:31.360> started<00:05:31.690> on<00:05:31.810> the<00:05:31.930> summer

00:05:32.159 --> 00:05:32.169 
and this is why I started on the summer

00:05:32.169 --> 00:05:33.360 
and this is why I started on the summer
I<00:05:32.259> just<00:05:32.319> started<00:05:32.650> I've<00:05:32.949> always<00:05:33.159> rode

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:33.370 
I just started I've always rode

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:36.149 
I just started I've always rode
off-roading<00:05:33.819> and<00:05:34.409> then<00:05:35.409> this<00:05:35.560> summer<00:05:35.800> we<00:05:36.009> got

00:05:36.149 --> 00:05:36.159 
off-roading and then this summer we got

00:05:36.159 --> 00:05:38.010 
off-roading and then this summer we got
