get<00:02:23.250> us<00:02:23.370> there<00:02:23.660> there's<00:02:24.660> a<00:02:24.750> bunch<00:02:25.020> that<00:02:25.260> have

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
get us there there's a bunch that have

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:29.720 
get us there there's a bunch that have
arrows<00:02:25.800> to<00:02:26.040> the<00:02:26.070> left<00:02:26.160> and<00:02:27.320> so<00:02:28.320> hopefully<00:02:29.280> this

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
arrows to the left and so hopefully this

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:32.600 
arrows to the left and so hopefully this
one<00:02:29.940> will<00:02:30.120> be<00:02:30.270> the<00:02:30.390> one<00:02:30.510> that<00:02:30.750> works<00:02:30.930> in<00:02:31.890> the<00:02:32.340> in

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
one will be the one that works in the in

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:34.550 
one will be the one that works in the in
the<00:02:32.910> tunnel<00:02:33.300> they<00:02:33.870> actually<00:02:34.230> accommodate

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
the tunnel they actually accommodate

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:39.740 
the tunnel they actually accommodate
both<00:02:34.950> trains<00:02:35.370> and<00:02:36.890> buses<00:02:38.030> so<00:02:39.030> we'll<00:02:39.209> see<00:02:39.480> how

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
both trains and buses so we'll see how

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:42.110 
both trains and buses so we'll see how
this<00:02:39.930> ultimately<00:02:40.440> plays<00:02:40.739> out<00:02:40.980> we<00:02:41.790> are<00:02:41.850> going

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
this ultimately plays out we are going

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.030 
this ultimately plays out we are going
to<00:02:42.180> make<00:02:42.360> this<00:02:42.570> left<00:02:42.840> turn<00:02:43.200> that<00:02:43.560> it's<00:02:43.739> telling

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
to make this left turn that it's telling

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.250 
to make this left turn that it's telling
us<00:02:44.160> to<00:02:44.310> take<00:02:44.459> to<00:02:45.150> get<00:02:45.300> to<00:02:45.360> the<00:02:45.480> link<00:02:45.750> light<00:02:45.989> rail

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
us to take to get to the link light rail

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.559 
us to take to get to the link light rail
to<00:02:47.160> the<00:02:47.190> tunnel

00:02:48.559 --> 00:02:48.569 
to the tunnel

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:50.869 
to the tunnel
and<00:02:48.810> so<00:02:49.200> I<00:02:49.500> think<00:02:50.219> what's<00:02:50.519> going<00:02:50.670> to<00:02:50.700> end<00:02:50.819> up

00:02:50.869 --> 00:02:50.879 
and so I think what's going to end up

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:51.949 
and so I think what's going to end up
happening<00:02:51.060> is<00:02:51.360> we're<00:02:51.510> going<00:02:51.599> to<00:02:51.659> need<00:02:51.719> to<00:02:51.870> go

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:51.959 
happening is we're going to need to go

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:54.740 
happening is we're going to need to go
down<00:02:52.260> the<00:02:53.189> escalator<00:02:53.310> or<00:02:54.060> take<00:02:54.329> an<00:02:54.450> elevator

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
down the escalator or take an elevator

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:57.709 
down the escalator or take an elevator
down<00:02:55.140> to<00:02:55.409> get<00:02:56.069> down<00:02:56.280> to<00:02:56.430> the<00:02:56.519> lower<00:02:56.670> level<00:02:57.090> and

00:02:57.709 --> 00:02:57.719 
down to get down to the lower level and

00:02:57.719 --> 00:02:59.809 
down to get down to the lower level and
that<00:02:57.870> will<00:02:58.019> then<00:02:58.049> be<00:02:58.349> in<00:02:58.409> an<00:02:58.500> okay<00:02:58.709> place<00:02:58.890> if<00:02:59.579> we

00:02:59.809 --> 00:02:59.819 
that will then be in an okay place if we

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:02.690 
that will then be in an okay place if we
wanted<00:03:00.090> to<00:03:00.150> come<00:03:00.420> in<00:03:00.599> via<00:03:01.140> Nordstrom's<00:03:01.859> those
