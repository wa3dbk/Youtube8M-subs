 thank you very much to all my

 the only one on YouTube dedicated 100% 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:38.590
 bean spirit in Spanish so you do not 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:40.809
 go to S 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:42.370
 all those videos of Japanese children and 

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:44.830
 coughs and gringos in which we do not understand 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:48.010
 absolutely nothing because of the problem of 

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:50.320
 language for that was born this channel and it's 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:53.379
 that's why after a long time of 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:55.210
 receive inbox and emails asking me to 

00:00:53.379 --> 00:00:59.800
 please do the review in Spanish 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:01:02.830
 from the funk kool club came to you 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:05.780
 this review in Spanish so we're going to 

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:08.180
 start with the famous funk um 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:10.409
 all right 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:14.009
 this is the 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:17.719
 super controversial and fun cubes 

00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:17.719
 the brand funk a 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:25.369
 that more than a brand seems the simple 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:28.830
 generic cube of the famous and 

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:31.950
 almighty diane sanchis 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:33.870
 this amazing cube sanchis that is the 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.090
 cube of the world records' the cube of 

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:40.710
 great times because it has finally arrived 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:43.350
 the generic or pirate cube or the cube more 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.990
 similar in the history of the spirit 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:48.290
 being to him 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:50.000
 they will ask why I say it good without 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:53.869
 place to doubt we are going to bring here to 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.850
 invoke half original giansanti together 

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:57.380
 with kool funk 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:00.860
 actually the two cubes are 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:03.409
 exactly the same size have the 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:06.020
 same opening in the part of the 

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:09.530
 centers here from the corners that you 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:11.709
 grants a similar cut of corners that 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:14.120
 cut corners monsters at 45 degrees 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:17.590
 but we are surprising is that I want 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:17.590
 see this 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:23.709
 this cube of the brand funk um 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:30.319
 It has the same parts as the Dalian 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:32.599
 sanchis 

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:35.200
 you can see them here in haifa quin 

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:35.200
 definition 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:41.940
 are the pieces of the original expansion the 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:45.080
 that all of us know 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:45.080
 here they have them 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:50.710
 this amazing design of dalián both in 

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:52.950
 the part of the corners as the part 

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:54.760
 of the edges 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:57.720
 amazing simply and simply 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:57.720
 surprising 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:04.650
 but 

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:07.069
 the one of the funk kool brand is exactly 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:11.620
 the same 

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:14.580
 with diane sanchis it 's the same 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:18.570
 the same damn thing is the same 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:21.510
 how a spirit is explained to see that a 

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:26.540
 cube be the perfect imitation of the 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:30.090
 previous they even took the time to 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:33.330
 put the same list this famous list 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:34.920
 on the edge that has the sanchis in the 

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:38.400
 funk kool 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:42.120
 it's absolutely the same design is a 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:46.830
 crazy thing honestly I do not know what 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:52.560
 it is due this is rumored out there that funk 

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:55.910
 kool has the permission or what you have 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:59.450
 as the authorization to produce 

00:03:55.910 --> 00:04:04.360
 a cube with the same pieces as diane 

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:06.820
 sanchez and that's why funk kool is born 

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:11.530
 the other big difference you have with the 

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:14.710
 sanchis is the core the core of the bank is 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:17.829
 terribly bad is a core of a 

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:19.780
 very dubious quality that I would not dare to 

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:23.310
 to say that it is good I dare to say 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:25.830
 which is very bad and 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:29.400
 therefore the cube does not have the same 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:32.729
 performance that diane sanchis turns very 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:36.210
 resemblance is very smooth in its turn 

00:04:32.729 --> 00:04:39.199
 but you do not have that abysmal speed that 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:39.199
 has the saiz workshop 

00:04:41.969 --> 00:04:48.929
 does not have the does not have that speed the 

00:04:46.379 --> 00:04:50.920
 last big problem with this cube is that 

00:04:48.929 --> 00:04:55.840
 the covers 

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:57.820
 of the cube falls without any sense without 

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:59.650
 absolutely no sense the tapas 

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:02.650
 they fly everywhere at the moment 

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:06.040
 to give it the sun and it's something that bothers me 

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:08.920
 very much at the time of solving it the 

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:11.920
 truth is that the tapas are a bit 

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:15.700
 poorly designed or simply and simply 

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:18.610
 we did not get it right in the in the 

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:21.940
 Cube assembly as for the layers 

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:24.730
 means the intermediates everything is still 

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:27.160
 very good but the truth is that this 

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:30.100
 that he falls the covers is a 

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:32.300
 aberration will only be a matter 

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:34.759
 of lubricating it and of 

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:38.030
 to give it a good fit and I will proceed 

00:05:34.759 --> 00:05:39.770
 to stick the covers to stefan cool because 

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:42.360
 hitting the covers as that will be removed 

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:45.530
 annoying problem 

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:48.569
 the performance of the cube for speed solving 

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:51.509
 honestly it's not bad at all 

00:05:48.569 --> 00:05:54.629
 I would say that it is very good bucket rotates better 

00:05:51.509 --> 00:05:58.139
 congost hunt turns better than any 

00:05:54.629 --> 00:05:59.729
 cube mincheng in f2 rotates better than 

00:05:58.139 --> 00:06:01.680
 most of the cubes that are considered 

00:05:59.729 --> 00:06:03.689
 for novices the truth that the 

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:06.599
 performance the cutting of corners is very 

00:06:03.689 --> 00:06:09.689
 good and far surpasses the cubes that 

00:06:06.599 --> 00:06:13.139
 I just mentioned so if you are 

00:06:09.689 --> 00:06:14.759
 novice and you're going to start or you do not have much 

00:06:13.139 --> 00:06:18.090
 money because this is the great advantage 

00:06:14.759 --> 00:06:20.250
 of funk unt that costs half of what 

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:21.990
 what does it cost wave yang sanchez and 

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:25.050
 honestly in terms of performance is 

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:27.779
 the closest to dalián sanchis to the 

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:29.400
 half price therefore it is a 

00:06:27.779 --> 00:06:31.500
 excellent purchase option and a 

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:33.599
 excellent option to get into the world 

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:36.900
 of the bean spirit solving that 

00:06:33.599 --> 00:06:38.550
 problem that you get the covers and 

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:40.319
 Well, I think that changing the 

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:44.020
 alcohol for one of the brand q for you 

00:06:40.319 --> 00:06:46.810
 there would be an excellent cube 

00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:49.780
 for now just as it comes from the box the 

00:06:46.810 --> 00:06:52.419
 material quality is decent is 

00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:56.979
 feels a little more current than the 

00:06:52.419 --> 00:07:00.000
 original sancho but for the price and for 

00:06:56.979 --> 00:07:03.610
 the quality of the step honestly is that 

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:05.530
 convinced me convinced me since the 

00:07:03.610 --> 00:07:09.069
 problems that it presents are solvable 

00:07:05.530 --> 00:07:12.099
 quickly and performance for speed 

00:07:09.069 --> 00:07:14.409
 olvin is pretty good for everyone 

00:07:12.099 --> 00:07:15.340
 our channel friends and subscribers 

00:07:14.409 --> 00:07:18.099
