00:02:35.759 --> 00:02:35.769 
actually fit normally right over this

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:38.280 
actually fit normally right over this
area<00:02:36.040> right<00:02:36.310> there<00:02:36.370> now<00:02:36.910> there<00:02:37.120> are<00:02:37.150> a<00:02:37.660> time<00:02:38.080> or

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.290 
area right there now there are a time or

that's<00:02:44.260> not<00:02:44.530> the<00:02:44.650> issue<00:02:44.769> but<00:02:45.130> they<00:02:45.340> they<00:02:45.880> won't

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.150 
that's not the issue but they they won't

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:49.140 
that's not the issue but they they won't
break<00:02:46.360> they're<00:02:46.570> not<00:02:46.720> that<00:02:46.900> brittle<00:02:47.350> so<00:02:47.950> if<00:02:48.880> you

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.150 
break they're not that brittle so if you

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:50.910 
break they're not that brittle so if you
do<00:02:49.450> need<00:02:49.600> to<00:02:49.720> do<00:02:49.840> that<00:02:50.019> that's<00:02:50.260> not<00:02:50.500> a<00:02:50.560> problem

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:50.920 
do need to do that that's not a problem

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:55.259 
do need to do that that's not a problem
but<00:02:51.730> this<00:02:52.000> will<00:02:52.870> fit<00:02:53.410> in<00:02:53.590> just<00:02:54.070> like<00:02:54.220> this<00:02:54.459> on
