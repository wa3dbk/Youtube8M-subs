hemoglobin<00:00:01.500> disassociation<00:00:02.460> curve<00:00:02.909> is<00:00:03.210> shown

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:03.570 
hemoglobin disassociation curve is shown

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:06.710 
hemoglobin disassociation curve is shown
below<00:00:03.980> sketch<00:00:04.980> the<00:00:05.460> expected<00:00:06.150> curve

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:06.720 
below sketch the expected curve

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.509 
below sketch the expected curve
following<00:00:07.319> an<00:00:07.440> increase<00:00:07.919> in<00:00:07.950> pH<00:00:08.599> think<00:00:09.599> about

00:00:10.509 --> 00:00:10.519 
following an increase in pH think about

00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:13.580 
following an increase in pH think about
what<00:00:11.519> happens<00:00:12.030> when<00:00:12.330> they're<00:00:12.630> the<00:00:13.049> conditions

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
what happens when they're the conditions

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:16.700 
what happens when they're the conditions
when<00:00:13.860> ph<00:00:14.099> is<00:00:14.219> increased<00:00:14.610> so<00:00:14.960> ph<00:00:15.960> is<00:00:16.139> decreased

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
when ph is increased so ph is decreased

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:24.019 
when ph is increased so ph is decreased
in<00:00:18.080> active<00:00:19.189> tissues<00:00:22.010> these<00:00:23.010> are<00:00:23.430> tissues<00:00:23.730> that

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
in active tissues these are tissues that

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.390 
in active tissues these are tissues that
are<00:00:24.090> using<00:00:24.689> a<00:00:24.869> lot<00:00:25.050> of<00:00:25.140> oxygen<00:00:25.289> and<00:00:25.769> generating

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
are using a lot of oxygen and generating

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.380 
are using a lot of oxygen and generating
co2<00:00:26.760> and<00:00:27.180> what<00:00:27.330> we<00:00:27.390> want<00:00:27.630> to<00:00:27.750> happen<00:00:27.930> is

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:29.390 
co2 and what we want to happen is

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:33.100 
co2 and what we want to happen is
decreased<00:00:30.390> hemoglobin<00:00:31.700> affinity<00:00:32.700> for<00:00:32.850> oxygen

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:33.110 
decreased hemoglobin affinity for oxygen

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:37.400 
decreased hemoglobin affinity for oxygen
so<00:00:34.110> the<00:00:34.140> result<00:00:34.590> is<00:00:34.980> if<00:00:35.280> pH<00:00:36.030> is<00:00:36.180> decreased<00:00:36.630> we

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
so the result is if pH is decreased we

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.650 
so the result is if pH is decreased we
get<00:00:37.559> the<00:00:37.710> shift<00:00:38.040> to<00:00:38.340> the<00:00:38.370> right<00:00:38.540> that<00:00:39.540> we

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
get the shift to the right that we

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.819 
get the shift to the right that we
talked<00:00:39.899> about<00:00:41.090> however<00:00:42.090> in<00:00:42.390> the<00:00:42.510> lungs<00:00:42.780> pH<00:00:43.590> is

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
talked about however in the lungs pH is

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:45.830 
talked about however in the lungs pH is
going<00:00:44.070> to<00:00:44.190> be<00:00:44.309> increased<00:00:44.910> that<00:00:45.600> would<00:00:45.719> be<00:00:45.780> an

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
going to be increased that would be an

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.540 
going to be increased that would be an
example<00:00:45.930> of<00:00:46.320> higher<00:00:46.829> higher<00:00:47.550> pH<00:00:47.969> and<00:00:49.430> what<00:00:50.430> we

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
example of higher higher pH and what we

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:56.889 
example of higher higher pH and what we
want<00:00:50.789> to<00:00:50.910> do<00:00:51.090> is<00:00:51.800> increase<00:00:52.800> the<00:00:53.250> affinity<00:00:53.969> of

00:00:56.889 --> 00:00:56.899 

00:00:56.899 --> 00:00:59.869 

hemoglobin<00:00:57.899> for<00:00:58.739> oxygen<00:00:59.250> because<00:00:59.489> we<00:00:59.640> want

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
hemoglobin for oxygen because we want

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.330 
hemoglobin for oxygen because we want
the<00:01:00.090> kemah<00:01:00.300> globin<00:01:00.690> to<00:01:00.989> take<00:01:01.410> the<00:01:01.649> oxygen<00:01:02.190> from

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
the kemah globin to take the oxygen from

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.090 
the kemah globin to take the oxygen from
the<00:01:02.399> lungs<00:01:02.960> therefore<00:01:03.960> there<00:01:04.589> is<00:01:04.619> going<00:01:04.920> to<00:01:05.070> be

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
the lungs therefore there is going to be

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.500 
the lungs therefore there is going to be
shift<00:01:05.720> to<00:01:06.720> the<00:01:06.750> left<00:01:07.400> so<00:01:08.400> the<00:01:08.549> curve<00:01:08.939> is<00:01:09.210> going

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
shift to the left so the curve is going

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:14.870 
shift to the left so the curve is going
to<00:01:09.659> be<00:01:09.810> shifted<00:01:10.770> to<00:01:10.979> the<00:01:11.670> left<00:01:12.979> so<00:01:13.979> taking<00:01:14.790> a

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
to be shifted to the left so taking a

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.060 
to be shifted to the left so taking a
look<00:01:15.030> at<00:01:15.150> this<00:01:15.270> just<00:01:15.570> to<00:01:15.750> check<00:01:16.020> shift<00:01:16.860> to<00:01:17.009> the

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
look at this just to check shift to the

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.050 
look at this just to check shift to the
left<00:01:17.159> is<00:01:17.640> correct<00:01:18.000> at<00:01:18.259> a<00:01:19.640> partial<00:01:20.640> pressure<00:01:20.880> of

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
left is correct at a partial pressure of

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:30.350 
left is correct at a partial pressure of
say<00:01:21.479> 30<00:01:22.369> in<00:01:23.720> my<00:01:24.720> original<00:01:25.020> curve<00:01:29.360> there's

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
say 30 in my original curve there's

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.649 
say 30 in my original curve there's
about<00:01:30.750> fifty<00:01:31.470> five<00:01:31.680> percent<00:01:32.659> hemoglobin

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
about fifty five percent hemoglobin

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:37.370 
about fifty five percent hemoglobin
saturation<00:01:34.229> in<00:01:34.640> my<00:01:35.640> new<00:01:35.939> curve<00:01:36.360> at<00:01:36.689> a<00:01:36.750> partial

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
saturation in my new curve at a partial

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:43.030 
saturation in my new curve at a partial
pressure<00:01:37.560> of<00:01:37.710> 30<00:01:40.400> there<00:01:41.400> is<00:01:41.670> actually<00:01:42.420> a

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:43.040 
pressure of 30 there is actually a

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:46.749 
pressure of 30 there is actually a
saturation<00:01:44.040> of<00:01:44.280> more<00:01:44.490> like<00:01:44.670> ninety<00:01:45.420> percent

00:01:46.749 --> 00:01:46.759 
saturation of more like ninety percent

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:52.370 
saturation of more like ninety percent
this<00:01:47.759> is<00:01:48.000> a<00:01:48.890> difference<00:01:49.890> of<00:01:50.009> 35<00:01:50.990> that<00:01:51.990> much

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
this is a difference of 35 that much

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.340 
this is a difference of 35 that much
more<00:01:52.710> oxygen<00:01:53.430> was<00:01:53.670> grabbed<00:01:54.329> it<00:01:54.780> was<00:01:54.960> picked<00:01:55.200> up

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
more oxygen was grabbed it was picked up

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.050 
more oxygen was grabbed it was picked up
which<00:01:55.649> is<00:01:55.770> what<00:01:55.950> you<00:01:56.040> want<00:01:56.250> so<00:01:56.579> the<00:01:56.700> answer<00:01:57.030> is

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
which is what you want so the answer is

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.789 
which is what you want so the answer is
that<00:01:57.270> there<00:01:57.390> would<00:01:57.570> be<00:01:57.600> a<00:01:57.719> shift<00:01:58.049> to<00:01:58.229> left<00:01:58.560> so

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
that there would be a shift to left so

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.789 
that there would be a shift to left so
the<00:01:58.890> curve<00:01:59.130> would<00:01:59.280> look<00:01:59.340> roughly<00:01:59.820> like<00:01:59.880> this

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:00.799 
the curve would look roughly like this

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:03.249 
the curve would look roughly like this
