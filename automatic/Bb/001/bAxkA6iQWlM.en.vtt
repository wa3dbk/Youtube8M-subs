00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:07.700
 hello, I'm Manuel Oliveres, veterinarian 

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:12.770
 the olive clinic in the stands 

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:15.050
 and from www.twitter.com I'm going to dedicate a 

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:17.029
 series of videos to talk a little about 

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:18.529
 of skin diseases both the 

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:20.750
 dogs like in cats today 

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:22.369
 concretely we are going to dedicate ourselves to what 

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:24.230
 which is the modest and is in the dog 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:26.390
 also known as scabies 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:29.180
 monetic this is a disease 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:32.390
 produced by a parasite a mite that 

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:34.250
 Molex is called canis and this mite 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:36.079
 the only way to power is microscopic 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:38.809
 see it is going to be using 

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:40.670
 of two microscopes as this is a 

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:42.739
 Mite that is going to come in shape 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:44.120
 Prophet in the skin is a mite 

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:46.429
 quite usual in the skin of the 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:48.649
 dogs but that the vast majority of 

00:00:46.429 --> 00:00:51.979
 Sometimes he lives there without producing any 

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:55.789
 type of alteration in the dog's coat 

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:58.339
 it happens that there are dogs that is for a 

00:00:55.789 --> 00:00:59.440
 problem of genetic type and intervene 

00:00:58.339 --> 00:01:02.179
 also type factors 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:04.010
 immunosuppressants are going to make this 

00:01:02.179 --> 00:01:06.229
 mite begins to multiply it 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:08.770
 develop and originate the injuries that 

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:11.079
 appear in this disease 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:13.509
 It is a disease that is going to transmit 

00:01:11.079 --> 00:01:16.950
 mother to the puppies in the first 

00:01:13.509 --> 00:01:19.719
 days of life when the puppies are born 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.819
 they are looking for the mother's nipples 

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:24.490
 catch to feed started with 

00:01:21.819 --> 00:01:26.979
 hands and in that moment of adaptation 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:29.679
 and pick up the nipple is when they go to 

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:31.630
 get in contact with those parasites 

00:01:29.679 --> 00:01:33.280
 there are some dogs in the litter that 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:35.799
 time will develop the disease and 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:37.750
 other no a priori not known because there would 

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:39.640
 than carrying out studies at the genetic level 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:42.009
 to be able to get to know things that 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:45.369
 it is usually not done if it is true 

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:47.860
 that when there are litters that suffer this 

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:50.140
 disease it is recommended that females 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:52.450
 do not want to produce the suitcases are not 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:54.250
 do not engage in reproduction for 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:56.259
 avoid that this 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:59.259
 disease that although most of the 

00:01:56.259 --> 00:02:00.250
 sometimes cheesy in a very light way other 

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:02.530
 Sometimes it can give enough 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:05.140
 complications and be a disease of 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:06.940
 type of chronic type 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:09.610
 this medal I say that is taken in the 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:12.400
 first days of life and these dogs 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:14.470
 will develop or not the disease that 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:16.480
 it happens that sometimes the periods in the 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:18.580
 they lower the defenses normally 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:20.800
 occur in the year of life in but is that 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:23.140
 they are in vaccination because there is a fall 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:26.080
 of that defensive system and then 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:27.820
 lesions will also appear this is 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:30.400
 can produce in animals and adults 

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:32.590
 but that the cause of this 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:35.319
 immunosuppression is going to be of another type 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:38.260
 then in a dog in which we see that 

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:41.140
 appears in the small areas of caritas 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:43.060
 at the level of the face normally in the 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:44.830
 forelimbs can you 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:47.200
 guide towards that we can have this 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:48.850
 this problem the disease the 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:50.590
 and can be presented as a 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:53.170
 localized form in which they will appear 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:55.209
 a few small capitals I say 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:59.350
 normally located at the level of 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:03:02.350
 eye level lips on the eyelids in 

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:04.860
 hands fore limbs 

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:08.440
 and this is one of modest 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:10.630
 located and normally this area that 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:13.900
 presented they have the puppies usually 

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:16.120
 heal spontaneously and positive 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:18.040
 with the passage of time 30 to 40 days 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:20.350
 these injuries disappear and no longer 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:23.260
 causes more problems again 

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:25.090
 Sometimes this localized form does not stay 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:27.070
 that generates or heals spontaneously but 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:28.660
 in reverse it is spreading passes 

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:31.120
 areas of neck trunk areas 

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:34.590
 hind limbs is generalized and 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:36.460
 Even in these cases, a 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:38.320
 infection a bacterial infection 

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:40.690
 over this disease by the 

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:42.340
 parasite and this problem of 

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:45.340
 bacterial contamination will give us 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:46.930
 place to other problems where he knows 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:49.660
 even breaks of the hair follicles 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:51.220
 giving rise to a movie the 

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:53.620
 deeper infections that are the 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:56.920
 forums that are going to require the 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:59.830
 more more aggressive treatments does in 

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:02.380
 this form of de moderates and it 

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:04.330
 widespread if you have to implement a 

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:06.610
 treatment I say good well more 

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:07.870
 aggressive course than that of 

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:08.620
 the located that was a mere 

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:11.049
 observation 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:12.819
 most of the time then there will be that 

00:04:11.049 --> 00:04:15.370
 so use a treatment for 

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:16.930
 eliminate these parasites by bathing 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:18.669
 you can use treatments 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:20.590
 injectables there are oral treatments 

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:23.229
 treatments that can be applied on 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:25.870
 the skin with a certain type of pipette 

00:04:23.229 --> 00:04:28.660
 then he will be our veterinarian 

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:30.760
 which depending on good then of the 

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:32.650
 nations of the extent of being 

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:35.530
 another complication send a 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:37.000
 treatment or another already commented before 

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:39.490
 that as there could also be here in 

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.190
 secondary bacterial infection would have 

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:44.889
 that also deal with antibiotic therapy 

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:47.860
 this type of bacteria to finish off 

00:04:44.889 --> 00:04:49.780
 control the box in the case of 

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:51.910
 adult dogs in which we already commented 

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:54.600
 that it was not normal for the 

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:56.919
 illness if there was not any cause 

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:58.870
 immunosuppressant and usually these 

00:04:56.919 --> 00:05:00.820
 causes can be processes 

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:03.460
 endocrine how is diabetes problems 

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:05.320
 of parasitic type such as the 

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:07.690
 leishmaniasis or type problems 

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:10.449
 neoclassical tumors are already any 

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:12.010
 level and all these types of pathologies go 

00:05:10.449 --> 00:05:13.660
 to cause a decrease in defenses and 

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:15.430
 these parasites of the 

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:17.110
 of the demolition serna that were in the 

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:19.840
 skin without original no injury 

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:21.730
 they start to reproduce very 

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:23.830
 fast and they're going to originate the box 

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:26.590
 of moderate and generalized 

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:28.420
 I already say that of doctors and it is not a 

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:30.700
 contagious disease our dog 

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:33.070
 You can have that parasite on your skin 

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:36.160
 can play with any other but without 

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:39.010
 that dog has absolutely nothing and 

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:42.190
 is going to be in these dogs that are already 

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:44.680
 genetically marked those that are going to 

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:46.390
 develop the disease of the 

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:48.340
 modest and therefore not a 

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:50.440
 disease in which we are going to be afraid 

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:52.900
 by contagion by direct contact 

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:55.690
 between dogs when they are playing 

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:57.550
 in between them when they are puppies 

00:05:55.690 --> 00:06:00.250
 above all but I tell you that the 

00:05:57.550 --> 00:06:02.500
 problem comes from when they are born because the 

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:05.530
 they will catch this disease through 

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:07.960
 his mother and not by contact with others with 

00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:09.310
 another good dog because this is what 

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:11.950
 I wanted to tell you about the 

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:13.390
 and the dog and I say that is the 

00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:16.450
 first video of those that we are going to devote 

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:18.680
 to study other skin diseases 

00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:21.080
 of our dogs and neonates 

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:22.820
 I hope you have been interested in 

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:24.680
 all ways if you have any questions 

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:26.360
 on this subject or any other that 

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:27.080
 be related to the health and care of 

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:29.060
 our animals 

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:30.500
 you can get in touch through the 

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:33.860
 telephone number that appears in 

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:37.550
 our website www point your vet 

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:39.650
 point info and there good because we can 

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:41.930
 give us all the information you want 

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:43.729
 about these topics good said 

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:47.320
 I hope it was of interest and we 

00:06:43.729 --> 00:06:47.320
 we see in the next one until soon
