00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.100 
isn't actually dead as you can see the
roots<00:01:07.680> are<00:01:07.830> very<00:01:08.040> much<00:01:08.189> alive<00:01:08.540> but<00:01:09.540> it's<00:01:09.869> very

that work that in just kind of like so

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:07.910 
that work that in just kind of like so
it's<00:02:05.430> about<00:02:05.579> all<00:02:05.729> that's<00:02:06.390> a<00:02:06.479> very<00:02:06.689> nice<00:02:06.990> you

can see you got a nice soil we're
working<00:02:09.450> with<00:02:09.569> it's<00:02:09.929> a<00:02:10.020> combination<00:02:10.349> of<00:02:10.679> some

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
working with it's a combination of some

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:12.830 
working with it's a combination of some
topsoil<00:02:11.940> that<00:02:12.120> I<00:02:12.180> had

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
topsoil that I had

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.930 
topsoil that I had
and<00:02:12.959> some<00:02:13.560> vermiculite<00:02:14.010> and<00:02:14.160> stuff<00:02:14.610> we<00:02:14.760> have

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
and some vermiculite and stuff we have

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:17.089 
and some vermiculite and stuff we have
over<00:02:15.180> there<00:02:15.390> works<00:02:16.319> pretty<00:02:16.500> well<00:02:16.650> for<00:02:16.950> these

00:02:17.089 --> 00:02:17.099 
over there works pretty well for these

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:21.890 
over there works pretty well for these
little<00:02:17.310> buckets<00:02:19.370> but<00:02:20.370> anyway<00:02:20.760> so<00:02:21.450> you<00:02:21.510> take<00:02:21.780> it

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
little buckets but anyway so you take it

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:23.150 
little buckets but anyway so you take it
like<00:02:22.019> that<00:02:22.050> put<00:02:22.440> a<00:02:22.470> little<00:02:22.590> bit<00:02:22.739> at<00:02:22.890> in<00:02:23.040> there

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
like that put a little bit at in there

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:26.860 
like that put a little bit at in there
that's<00:02:23.370> plenty<00:02:23.640> believe<00:02:24.540> it<00:02:24.660> or<00:02:24.720> not<00:02:25.129> you<00:02:26.129> know

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:26.870 
that's plenty believe it or not you know

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:29.119 
that's plenty believe it or not you know
another<00:02:27.870> thing<00:02:27.989> I<00:02:28.230> plan<00:02:28.470> on<00:02:28.590> working<00:02:28.709> on<00:02:28.980> in

00:02:29.119 --> 00:02:29.129 
another thing I plan on working on in

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:32.509 
another thing I plan on working on in
2014<00:02:29.970> is<00:02:30.150> a<00:02:30.269> self<00:02:30.980> fertilizing<00:02:31.980> bucket<00:02:32.370> so

00:02:32.509 --> 00:02:32.519 
2014 is a self fertilizing bucket so

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:35.119 
2014 is a self fertilizing bucket so
that<00:02:32.670> we<00:02:32.730> have<00:02:32.760> a<00:02:32.940> completely<00:02:33.690> closed<00:02:34.650> system

00:02:35.119 --> 00:02:35.129 
that we have a completely closed system

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:36.710 
that we have a completely closed system
so<00:02:35.370> because<00:02:35.580> right<00:02:35.760> now<00:02:35.790> the<00:02:36.000> rain<00:02:36.360> will<00:02:36.510> wash

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
so because right now the rain will wash

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.710 
so because right now the rain will wash
some<00:02:37.500> of<00:02:37.590> your<00:02:37.709> nutrient<00:02:38.280> away<00:02:38.519> but<00:02:38.819> we<00:02:39.569> can

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
some of your nutrient away but we can

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:41.660 
some of your nutrient away but we can
make<00:02:39.870> a<00:02:39.900> self<00:02:40.260> fertilizing<00:02:40.920> system<00:02:41.340> that'd<00:02:41.519> be

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
make a self fertilizing system that'd be

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:43.940 
make a self fertilizing system that'd be
even<00:02:41.730> better<00:02:42.060> in<00:02:42.989> that<00:02:43.140> dream<00:02:43.440> of<00:02:43.620> a<00:02:43.709> self

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
even better in that dream of a self

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:45.199 
even better in that dream of a self
fertilizing<00:02:44.549> garden<00:02:44.819> is<00:02:44.910> something<00:02:45.150> I've

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209

00:03:00.759 --> 00:03:00.769 

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:02.780 

we're<00:03:01.769> going<00:03:01.890> to<00:03:01.920> plan<00:03:02.129> a<00:03:02.160> whole<00:03:02.370> bunch<00:03:02.610> of

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
we're going to plan a whole bunch of

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:08.600 
we're going to plan a whole bunch of
them<00:03:05.299> seeing<00:03:06.299> some<00:03:06.510> ants<00:03:06.840> down<00:03:06.959> in<00:03:07.170> there<00:03:07.610> we

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:08.610 
them seeing some ants down in there we

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:10.039 
them seeing some ants down in there we
can<00:03:08.730> thin<00:03:08.970> them<00:03:09.000> out<00:03:09.180> as<00:03:09.360> needed<00:03:09.390> so<00:03:09.870> it's<00:03:09.989> just

00:03:10.039 --> 00:03:10.049 
can thin them out as needed so it's just

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:13.250 
can thin them out as needed so it's just
kind<00:03:10.260> of<00:03:10.319> a<00:03:10.410> microgreen<00:03:11.099> sort<00:03:11.579> of<00:03:11.670> thing<00:03:11.879> I<00:03:12.260> use

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 
kind of a microgreen sort of thing I use

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.460 
kind of a microgreen sort of thing I use
these<00:03:13.410> for<00:03:13.590> the<00:03:13.680> salads<00:03:14.069> and<00:03:14.430> there<00:03:14.579> we<00:03:14.700> go<00:03:15.470> all

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:31.190 
soil this is basically sand peat moss

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:34.750 
soil this is basically sand peat moss
and<00:03:32.190> there's<00:03:32.549> some<00:03:32.819> worm<00:03:33.120> castings<00:03:33.750> in<00:03:33.870> it<00:03:34.019> and

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:34.760 
and there's some worm castings in it and

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:38.539 
and there's some worm castings in it and
just<00:03:35.760> several<00:03:36.180> years<00:03:36.599> worth<00:03:36.870> of<00:03:37.340> just<00:03:38.340> turning

00:03:38.539 --> 00:03:38.549 
just several years worth of just turning

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:40.990 
just several years worth of just turning
in<00:03:38.910> various<00:03:39.389> amounts<00:03:39.840> of<00:03:40.079> gardening<00:03:40.500> waste

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:41.000 
in various amounts of gardening waste

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.400 
in various amounts of gardening waste
and<00:03:42.000> just<00:03:42.450> like<00:03:42.599> we<00:03:42.750> did<00:03:42.870> with<00:03:42.989> the<00:03:43.049> lettuce

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:43.410 
and just like we did with the lettuce

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:46.849 
and just like we did with the lettuce
just<00:03:43.590> Pat<00:03:43.799> it<00:03:43.829> and<00:03:44.069> gently<00:03:44.370> again<00:03:45.829> I'm<00:03:46.829> not

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:46.859 
just Pat it and gently again I'm not

00:03:46.859 --> 00:03:49.009 
just Pat it and gently again I'm not
going<00:03:47.220> to<00:03:47.280> water<00:03:47.549> it<00:03:47.700> in<00:03:48.000> simply<00:03:48.480> because<00:03:48.810> this

00:03:49.009 --> 00:03:49.019 
going to water it in simply because this

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:52.699 
going to water it in simply because this
soil<00:03:49.940> retains<00:03:50.940> almost<00:03:51.810> always<00:03:52.169> a<00:03:52.200> good<00:03:52.500> bit<00:03:52.680> of

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:52.709 
soil retains almost always a good bit of

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:56.229 
soil retains almost always a good bit of
moisture<00:03:52.919> I've<00:03:53.190> never<00:03:53.400> really<00:03:53.849> had<00:03:54.060> these

00:03:56.229 --> 00:03:56.239 
moisture I've never really had these

00:03:56.239 --> 00:03:58.670 
moisture I've never really had these
really<00:03:57.239> totally<00:03:57.599> dry<00:03:57.840> on<00:03:58.079> me<00:03:58.230> especially<00:03:58.470> this

00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:58.680 
really totally dry on me especially this

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:00.680 
really totally dry on me especially this
time<00:03:58.739> of<00:03:58.950> the<00:03:59.099> year<00:03:59.180> but<00:04:00.180> and<00:04:00.510> that's

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:00.690 
time of the year but and that's

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:03.759 
time of the year but and that's
basically<00:04:00.930> if<00:04:01.319> that's<00:04:01.709> planting<00:04:02.340> arugula<00:04:02.849> and

00:04:03.759 --> 00:04:03.769 
basically if that's planting arugula and

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:06.110 
basically if that's planting arugula and
and<00:04:04.769> that's<00:04:04.859> how<00:04:05.069> that's<00:04:05.310> going<00:04:05.430> to<00:04:05.489> go<00:04:05.549> just

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:06.120 
and that's how that's going to go just
