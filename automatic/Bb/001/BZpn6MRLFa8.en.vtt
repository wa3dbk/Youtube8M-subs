now in the trickiest part of the OCO
carb<00:00:04.080> or<00:00:04.549> the<00:00:05.549> can<00:00:06.620> is<00:00:07.620> this<00:00:08.069> vent<00:00:08.910> tube<00:00:09.260> right

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260 
carb or the can is this vent tube right

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.570 
carb or the can is this vent tube right
here<00:00:10.290> from<00:00:10.830> hell<00:00:11.420> this<00:00:12.420> vent<00:00:12.750> tube<00:00:12.960> right<00:00:13.200> here

here from hell this vent tube right here

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:15.169 
here from hell this vent tube right here
will<00:00:14.580> go

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
will go

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:23.900 
will go
I<00:00:20.930> can't<00:00:21.930> against<00:00:22.380> stand<00:00:22.619> it<00:00:22.769> up<00:00:22.920> anyway<00:00:23.789> the

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
I can't against stand it up anyway the

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:25.910 
I can't against stand it up anyway the
vent<00:00:24.119> tube<00:00:24.300> goes<00:00:24.510> right<00:00:24.869> in<00:00:25.109> between<00:00:25.410> here

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
vent tube goes right in between here

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.460 
vent tube goes right in between here
okay<00:00:26.820> as<00:00:27.000> this<00:00:27.359> sits<00:00:27.630> you<00:00:27.810> can<00:00:27.960> see<00:00:28.140> that<00:00:28.380> the

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
okay as this sits you can see that the

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:29.779 
okay as this sits you can see that the
vent<00:00:28.650> tube<00:00:28.830> won't<00:00:29.010> go<00:00:29.160> in<00:00:29.310> between<00:00:29.429> there

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
vent tube won't go in between there

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:34.430 
vent tube won't go in between there
because<00:00:31.070> the<00:00:32.070> float<00:00:32.309> bowls<00:00:32.550> in<00:00:32.730> a<00:00:32.820> way<00:00:33.290> so<00:00:34.290> what

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
because the float bowls in a way so what

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.040 
because the float bowls in a way so what
you<00:00:34.559> have<00:00:34.739> to<00:00:34.800> do<00:00:35.040> with<00:00:35.550> this<00:00:35.700> vent<00:00:36.000> tube<00:00:36.270> is

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
you have to do with this vent tube is

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.639 
you have to do with this vent tube is
hold<00:00:37.440> a<00:00:37.590> carburetor<00:00:38.040> at<00:00:38.280> an<00:00:38.399> angle<00:00:39.440> so<00:00:40.440> that

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
hold a carburetor at an angle so that

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.720 
hold a carburetor at an angle so that
your<00:00:42.170> your<00:00:43.170> floats<00:00:43.500> art<00:00:43.920> can<00:00:44.250> go<00:00:44.370> back<00:00:44.550> and

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
your your floats art can go back and

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.209 
your your floats art can go back and
forth<00:00:44.910> like<00:00:44.969> this<00:00:45.120> and<00:00:45.860> then<00:00:46.860> you<00:00:47.129> put<00:00:47.370> the

00:00:49.209 --> 00:00:49.219 
forth like this and then you put the

00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:52.369 
forth like this and then you put the
float<00:00:50.219> Bowl<00:00:50.370> on<00:00:50.640> and<00:00:50.879> slowly<00:00:51.600> move<00:00:51.960> this<00:00:52.170> back

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379

and<00:00:52.620> forth<00:00:52.680> back<00:00:53.100> and<00:00:53.129> forth<00:00:54.170> with<00:00:55.170> the<00:00:55.410> vent

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
and forth back and forth with the vent

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.990 
and forth back and forth with the vent
tube<00:00:55.890> this<00:00:56.610> vent<00:00:56.940> tube<00:00:57.149> right<00:00:57.420> there<00:00:57.500> until<00:00:59.000> it

different multiple carburetors are the

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:32.780 
different multiple carburetors are the
same<00:01:31.470> thing<00:01:31.710> even<00:01:31.950> though<00:01:32.100> they<00:01:32.220> got<00:01:32.400> this

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
same thing even though they got this

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:37.550 
same thing even though they got this
really<00:01:33.270> complicated<00:01:35.689> linkages<00:01:36.689> which<00:01:37.170> what's

make the rubber part eight times bigger

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:09.889 
make the rubber part eight times bigger
than<00:02:08.670> it<00:02:08.789> should<00:02:08.940> be<00:02:09.090> and<00:02:09.119> it<00:02:09.360> does<00:02:09.539> not<00:02:09.720> go

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
than it should be and it does not go

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.050 
than it should be and it does not go
back<00:02:10.050> down<00:02:10.319> so<00:02:11.190> you<00:02:11.280> want<00:02:11.489> to<00:02:11.610> take<00:02:11.790> the

minutes<00:06:03.469> and<00:06:03.740> then<00:06:03.889> it<00:06:04.009> stopped<00:06:04.310> work<00:06:04.550> it's

00:06:04.869 --> 00:06:04.879
