wire<00:02:39.970> at<00:02:40.180> the<00:02:40.209> top<00:02:40.390> you<00:02:41.049> can<00:02:41.819> take<00:02:42.819> a<00:02:42.849> pair<00:02:43.540> of

00:02:43.559 --> 00:02:43.569 
wire at the top you can take a pair of

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:49.170 
wire at the top you can take a pair of
pliers<00:02:43.660> just<00:02:44.080> slightly<00:02:44.920> flatten<00:02:45.430> the<00:02:45.519> top<00:02:48.180> and
