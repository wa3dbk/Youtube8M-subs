00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
machines that are just high frequency

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.420 
machines that are just high frequency
which<00:02:03.090> are<00:02:03.270> radio<00:02:03.659> wave<00:02:03.930> and<00:02:04.229> then<00:02:04.890> we<00:02:05.159> have

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
which are radio wave and then we have

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.540 
which are radio wave and then we have
the<00:02:05.700> sterile<00:02:06.119> probes<00:02:06.479> we<00:02:07.469> have<00:02:07.860> our<00:02:08.190> timer

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
the sterile probes we have our timer

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.089 
the sterile probes we have our timer
which<00:02:09.179> tells<00:02:09.810> how<00:02:10.110> much<00:02:10.289> we're<00:02:10.500> earning<00:02:10.890> and

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
which tells how much we're earning and

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:13.700 
which tells how much we're earning and
the<00:02:11.730> clock<00:02:12.000> our<00:02:12.300> work<00:02:12.540> so<00:02:12.989> we<00:02:13.230> charge

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
the clock our work so we charge

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:17.270 
the clock our work so we charge
by<00:02:14.010> this<00:02:14.280> timer<00:02:14.580> and<00:02:14.880> we<00:02:15.720> have<00:02:15.960> at<00:02:16.350> the<00:02:16.950> end<00:02:17.100> of

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
by this timer and we have at the end of

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.970 
by this timer and we have at the end of
the<00:02:17.400> work<00:02:17.580> we<00:02:17.790> use<00:02:18.030> a<00:02:18.060> cool<00:02:18.480> aloe<00:02:18.990> gel<00:02:19.650> and

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
the work we use a cool aloe gel and

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:21.770 
the work we use a cool aloe gel and
sometimes<00:02:20.460> if<00:02:20.610> I<00:02:20.670> do<00:02:20.730> a<00:02:20.850> lot<00:02:21.090> of<00:02:21.210> work<00:02:21.360> I<00:02:21.540> use

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
sometimes if I do a lot of work I use

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:23.960 
sometimes if I do a lot of work I use
ice<00:02:22.020> packs<00:02:22.410> because<00:02:23.220> we<00:02:23.340> want<00:02:23.550> to<00:02:23.670> soothe<00:02:23.940> the

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
ice packs because we want to soothe the

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:28.040 
ice packs because we want to soothe the
skin<00:02:24.360> when<00:02:25.230> we're<00:02:25.410> done<00:02:25.560> with<00:02:25.740> the<00:02:25.860> work
