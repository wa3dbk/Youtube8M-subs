a lot of people are playing
which<00:01:42.230> is<00:01:42.350> a<00:01:42.380> little<00:01:42.710> bit<00:01:42.830> of<00:01:44.350> like<00:01:45.350> I<00:01:45.470> said

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:45.680 
which is a little bit of like I said

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:47.440 
which is a little bit of like I said
he's<00:01:46.220> just<00:01:46.430> gonna<00:01:46.520> be<00:01:46.850> gonna<00:01:46.970> poach<00:01:47.240> some

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:47.450 
he's just gonna be gonna poach some

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:49.570 
he's just gonna be gonna poach some
goals<00:01:47.660> he's<00:01:48.470> gonna<00:01:48.650> hold<00:01:48.830> up<00:01:49.010> guys<00:01:49.130> off<00:01:49.400> of

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:49.580 
goals he's gonna hold up guys off of

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:51.550 
goals he's gonna hold up guys off of
strength<00:01:49.930> it's<00:01:50.930> gonna<00:01:51.020> take<00:01:51.110> some<00:01:51.320> real

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:51.560 
strength it's gonna take some real

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:53.140 
strength it's gonna take some real
special<00:01:51.950> center<00:01:52.160> bags<00:01:52.370> to<00:01:52.580> fight<00:01:52.760> him<00:01:52.880> off<00:01:53.000> the

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:53.150 
special center bags to fight him off the

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:56.170 
special center bags to fight him off the
ball<00:01:53.360> and<00:01:53.960> I<00:01:54.770> think<00:01:55.190> that<00:01:55.310> makes<00:01:55.550> him<00:01:55.610> a<00:01:55.790> really

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:56.180 
ball and I think that makes him a really

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:58.660 
ball and I think that makes him a really
really<00:01:56.690> solid<00:01:57.020> option<00:01:57.590> especially<00:01:57.860> if<00:01:58.490> you're

00:01:58.660 --> 00:01:58.670 
really solid option especially if you're

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:00.220 
really solid option especially if you're
just<00:01:58.820> getting<00:01:59.000> started<00:01:59.390> you<00:01:59.750> really<00:02:00.020> need<00:02:00.200> to

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:00.230 
just getting started you really need to

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:02.140 
just getting started you really need to
to<00:02:00.710> rack<00:02:00.890> up<00:02:00.920> some<00:02:01.100> points<00:02:01.790> in<00:02:01.910> the<00:02:01.970> early

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:02.150 
to rack up some points in the early

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:04.210 
to rack up some points in the early
divisions<00:02:02.660> like<00:02:02.990> I<00:02:03.140> am<00:02:03.320> right<00:02:03.350> now<00:02:03.740> kind<00:02:04.160> of

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:04.220 
divisions like I am right now kind of

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:07.480 
divisions like I am right now kind of
struggling<00:02:04.580> he's<00:02:05.590> really<00:02:06.590> been<00:02:06.740> a<00:02:06.800> a<00:02:07.160> point

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:07.490 
struggling he's really been a a point

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:09.730 
struggling he's really been a a point
