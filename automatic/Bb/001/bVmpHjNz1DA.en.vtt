 Y 

00:00:11.559 --> 00:00:16.360
 i 

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:16.360
 Y 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:23.660
 two 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:34.570
 hello that as I always hope you 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:36.579
 find the best you know that I am 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:37.989
 gilberto manager and your cough in this 

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:39.340
 occasion we are going to review a lesson 

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:41.230
 quite different from what I am 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:43.809
 used to climb since I'm going to 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:46.079
 show a type of exercise that I 

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:48.970
 I use enough to lighten my fingers 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:50.739
 it is a series of chords that 

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:52.870
 they play with the arpeggio technique and 

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:54.220
 they sound pretty good in my opinion and well 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:55.989
 first of all I remind you that the 

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:59.110
 Arpeggios technique is basically 

00:00:55.989 --> 00:01:00.879
 to use your fingers looking for strings 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:04.000
 by rope so that this produces a 

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:06.310
 sound that looks like a harp and finally 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.220
 let's start with the chords and 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:13.899
 I use first of all a minor 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:16.420
 then a world without the index finger in 

00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:18.910
 the first fret of the second string I 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:20.610
 it seems like it's a seventh minor if I 

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:23.830
 I'm wrong here I put the correction 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:25.929
 after a sun only that without any 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:28.240
 finger down on the third fret of the 

00:01:25.929 --> 00:01:30.429
 first string also has name is 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:33.970
 I put it here and then the next 

00:01:30.429 --> 00:01:34.350
 chord that it's about the middle finger in 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:36.930
 the 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:39.299
 fret of the sixth and the ring finger 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.689
 also in the second but the third 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.689
 rope 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:46.939
 also throughout the song 

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:51.790
 he also used the chord two and in the 

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:54.550
 finger but moved the frets 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:56.440
 that would be the ring in the fifth 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:59.350
 fret of the fifth string and the finger 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:01.480
 medium in the fourth of the fourth and well 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:04.180
 of entry placing a minor 

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:07.890
 I make a descending arpeggio of the sixth 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:07.890
 up to the third string 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:16.060
 and then I do fourth fourth fourth so 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:16.060
 what would be left 

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:20.160
 then I will do practically what 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:24.050
 same only that starting with the 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:24.050
 fifth in the chord 

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:31.170
 again the same but the sixth for 

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:34.080
 down 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:36.380
 in which it looks like a sun and in the last 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.380
 chord 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:41.209
 exactly the same starting with sixth 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:46.040
 so it would basically start with 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:48.670
 sixth later by removing by sixth of 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.670
 new by sixth 

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:54.980
 and here we have basically the progression 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:56.720
 basic to play the exercise 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:59.239
 but then when he starts playing 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:03.519
 I start to fix arrangements for example 

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:03.519
 in a minor there is not much to do 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:10.680
 but in the dow we can place the finger 

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:10.680
 index on the first fret of the second 

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:18.190
 then in the sun we can put the finger 

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:18.190
 little finger on the third fret of the fifth 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:23.330
 and then there is not the great thing 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:29.319
 do I think you can comment 

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:29.319
 what did you do so far from sounding like that 

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:36.000
 it could be like that 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:46.209
 and even on the fly you can go 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:46.209
 making modifications 

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:55.850
 and you can also do what I mentioned 

00:03:53.330 --> 00:04:01.450
 at the beginning that is to slide the chord 

00:03:55.850 --> 00:04:01.450
 finger up here what might sound like this 

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:09.739
 and here I use a pretty resource 

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:12.500
 interesting that is with my index finger 

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:13.670
 play third fret of the sixth and 

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:17.290
 after the second making a 

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:17.290
 descending arpeggio that would remain that way 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:24.120
 and ended up putting 

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:26.140
 the minor or the other chord and finally 

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:29.790
 I only use it as a resource 

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:29.790
 so that it falls into another chord 

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:39.230
 and basically it 's everything and if anything for 

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:40.910
 final I use this chord which 

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:44.570
 It has a very mysterious sound 

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:46.639
 consists of the index finger in the second 

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:49.750
 fret of the fifth and the ring finger in 

00:04:46.639 --> 00:04:49.750
 the fourth of the fourth 

00:04:50.569 --> 00:04:55.099
 but personal of my favorite chords 

00:04:52.819 --> 00:04:56.869
 and fine with these chords even with more 

00:04:55.099 --> 00:04:58.580
 that happen to you, you can make a 

00:04:56.869 --> 00:05:00.589
 good progression that you can well 

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:02.119
 use it to practice or to design 

00:05:00.589 --> 00:05:03.949
 your own song as always 

00:05:02.119 --> 00:05:05.569
