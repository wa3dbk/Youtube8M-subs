00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.890
 Hello I had in my balcony 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:07.350
 neither here from the Balkans and today 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:10.440
 I show you how I like my tomatoes 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:13.110
 Seeds themselves harvest the seeds 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:16.650
 prepared for next year here 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:18.930
 I here a tomato rose locations Bernese 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.369
 as you know if you're on a canal 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.680
 in a sense that 's the one here 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.449
 big plant that is definitely 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.090
 So I can fix a seed 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:31.560
 Hybrid should be able to do that again 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:34.739
 multiply and which is also very important 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:38.780
 the tomato should be very mature 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:42.180
 this is very beneficial for the seed 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:44.550
 that's the berner rose as mentioned 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:47.190
 not bright red now that has such a 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.899
 light pink touch that's why 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.030
 probably also the name comes from 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:56.039
 Switzerland 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:58.670
 the variety only, of course, then good 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:02.239
 for cooler lay as well as here and 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:02.239
 Now let's go in 

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:12.960
 I already have some on the internet 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.670
 different ways to see how 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:19.009
 can do that 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:22.110
 There are some pretty complicated ones 

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:23.100
 but you can do that 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.409
 also do so 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.630
 you really do not have to complicate it 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:29.100
 So if you do that now 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:32.310
 Do as I do on whole 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:34.350
 it works just as easily 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.630
 So we quarter here the tomato and you 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:40.170
 see here already the tomato seeds 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:42.869
 and we just have to get one 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:47.040
 but we sacrifice tomato from your shrub 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:51.829
 even Italians got Sami in it like that 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:56.720
 Now here's a spoon and 

00:01:51.829 --> 00:01:56.720
 trude out here very slowly 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:07.810
 At the side we only take the 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:11.860
 other side out that is now 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:18.120
 the sticky note that the tomato 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:20.820
 I have now removed everything here 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:24.820
 So there we get a lot 

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:29.230
 tomato plants I would be rough now 

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:33.940
 appreciate that are safe 50 850th 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:36.550
 plants and so you have stop sooner too 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:38.680
 the seed of merz and you see 

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:44.050
 negative is just awesome 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:45.760
 tomato we get about 50 new 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:48.040
 plant naturally also depends on 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:50.200
 Vending machines should be off so I do it 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:51.400
 really not complicated like that now 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:53.170
 do the other 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:03:00.250
 I'm going to press this a little bit now 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:03:03.760
 the sticky one here a bit 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:07.150
 so do not soften so tightly 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:09.190
 so that does not break the seed so 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:11.590
 which is also very important in the 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:14.769
 history here you have to be like this 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:16.450
 wooden board so take no cellar because 

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:20.290
 the wood part fulfilled namely 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:22.239
 certain sense the first sucks first 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:25.060
 here the liquid very fast 

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:27.340
 as you see and then to dry 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:29.880
 It's also much better that way 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:32.290
 Now we take a cake crepe 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:34.540
 press that you can see on it already 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:40.170
 all liquid becomes here 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:44.610
 is absorbed we have here again 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:44.610
 the seeds down poland 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:56.160
 work here from a maximum of five 

00:03:52.570 --> 00:04:03.690
 minutes what we would have to invest 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:09.730
 again dabbed here again 

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:13.330
 emphasize so i believe that 

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:23.530
 I dabbed enough I give you 

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:27.610
 just to sing a bit then 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:29.560
 it's off to the sun now just 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:32.460
 again the other chamber and we go 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:34.870
 out to the same 

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:37.419
 I'm back here again 

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:39.700
 my high bed there I just as 

00:04:37.419 --> 00:04:42.810
 board set as you see 

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:45.190
 Can you with the seed granules here 

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:47.770
 and that's just two days away 

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:49.990
 stand in the sun and then they are 

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:53.470
 really so dry that you just 

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:55.600
 can feel around and for next year 

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:56.190
 So it's even easier 

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:58.810
 Not or 

00:04:56.190 --> 00:05:02.040
 until next time your christin out 

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:02.040
 balconies show
