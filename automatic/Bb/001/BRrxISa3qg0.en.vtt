hi guys this is my review of the many
more<00:00:03.149> you<00:00:03.300> hour-long<00:00:03.510> three<00:00:04.020> by<00:00:04.170> three<00:00:04.440> so

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:04.710 
more you hour-long three by three so

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:06.710 
more you hour-long three by three so
what<00:00:05.040> did<00:00:05.160> I<00:00:05.250> do<00:00:05.310> to<00:00:05.430> this<00:00:05.609> cube<00:00:05.940> so<00:00:06.270> this<00:00:06.299> time

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:06.720 
what did I do to this cube so this time

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:08.089 
what did I do to this cube so this time
what<00:00:07.140> I<00:00:07.170> did<00:00:07.379> differently<00:00:07.830> to<00:00:08.069> the

00:00:08.089 --> 00:00:08.099 
what I did differently to the

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:11.000 
what I did differently to the
57-millimeter<00:00:09.000> was<00:00:09.599> not<00:00:09.990> lubing<00:00:10.469> the<00:00:10.559> pieces

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.010 
57-millimeter was not lubing the pieces

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:13.339 
57-millimeter was not lubing the pieces
so<00:00:11.639> I<00:00:11.670> left<00:00:12.000> the<00:00:12.210> factory<00:00:12.389> lube<00:00:12.750> on<00:00:12.870> it<00:00:13.019> but<00:00:13.170> all

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
so I left the factory lube on it but all

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:15.289 
so I left the factory lube on it but all
i<00:00:13.380> did<00:00:13.650> was<00:00:13.679> lube<00:00:14.040> the<00:00:14.190> screw<00:00:14.580> springs<00:00:15.089> and

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
i did was lube the screw springs and

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:16.609 
i did was lube the screw springs and
washers<00:00:15.719> and<00:00:15.870> that's<00:00:16.080> what<00:00:16.230> i<00:00:16.260> think<00:00:16.350> i

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
washers and that's what i think i

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:18.200 
washers and that's what i think i
recommend<00:00:17.250> for<00:00:17.400> you<00:00:17.460> guys<00:00:17.609> to<00:00:17.699> do<00:00:17.850> if<00:00:18.000> you<00:00:18.090> guys

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
recommend for you guys to do if you guys

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:19.790 
recommend for you guys to do if you guys
are<00:00:18.330> going<00:00:18.420> to<00:00:18.539> get<00:00:18.630> either<00:00:18.750> the<00:00:18.869> mini<00:00:19.380> version

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
are going to get either the mini version

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.950 
are going to get either the mini version
or<00:00:19.890> the<00:00:19.920> standard<00:00:20.310> version<00:00:20.340> is<00:00:21.300> to<00:00:21.510> not<00:00:21.689> loop

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
or the standard version is to not loop

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.450 
or the standard version is to not loop
the<00:00:22.109> pieces<00:00:22.500> because<00:00:22.800> i<00:00:22.920> think<00:00:22.980> once<00:00:23.369> you

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
the pieces because i think once you

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:24.980 
the pieces because i think once you
leave<00:00:23.609> the<00:00:23.730> pieces<00:00:24.090> touch<00:00:24.390> the<00:00:24.689> starts

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
leave the pieces touch the starts

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:26.570 
leave the pieces touch the starts
turning<00:00:25.289> really<00:00:25.529> glog<00:00:25.830> lee<00:00:25.980> kind<00:00:26.189> of<00:00:26.250> feeling

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
turning really glog lee kind of feeling

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.250 
turning really glog lee kind of feeling
just<00:00:26.789> feels<00:00:27.000> really<00:00:27.119> weird<00:00:27.390> but<00:00:27.900> without<00:00:28.080> the

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
just feels really weird but without the

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.150 
just feels really weird but without the
lube<00:00:28.590> on<00:00:28.710> the<00:00:28.800> pieces<00:00:30.320> it<00:00:31.320> performs<00:00:31.980> really

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
lube on the pieces it performs really

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.130 
lube on the pieces it performs really
really<00:00:32.520> nice<00:00:32.700> and<00:00:33.000> it<00:00:33.180> turns<00:00:33.480> really<00:00:33.809> nicely

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
really nice and it turns really nicely

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.209 
really nice and it turns really nicely
it's<00:00:34.559> smooth<00:00:35.100> and<00:00:35.399> when<00:00:36.270> you<00:00:36.360> speed<00:00:36.750> solve<00:00:37.020> it

00:00:37.209 --> 00:00:37.219 
it's smooth and when you speed solve it

00:00:37.219 --> 00:00:40.250 
it's smooth and when you speed solve it
it<00:00:38.219> feels<00:00:38.520> kind<00:00:38.730> of<00:00:38.760> crispy<00:00:39.239> and<00:00:39.570> crispy

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
it feels kind of crispy and crispy

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.130 
it feels kind of crispy and crispy
feeling<00:00:40.530> crispy<00:00:41.070> sounding<00:00:41.520> basically<00:00:42.140> so

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
feeling crispy sounding basically so

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.080 
feeling crispy sounding basically so
yeah<00:00:43.440> the<00:00:43.649> performance<00:00:44.250> wise<00:00:44.399> feeling<00:00:44.940> I

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
yeah the performance wise feeling I

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.660 
yeah the performance wise feeling I
really<00:00:45.539> do<00:00:45.690> like<00:00:45.899> it<00:00:45.930> but<00:00:46.320> it<00:00:47.250> still<00:00:47.430> has<00:00:47.520> that

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
really do like it but it still has that

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.029 
really do like it but it still has that
kind<00:00:47.789> of<00:00:47.969> flimsiness<00:00:48.930> to<00:00:49.260> it<00:00:49.379> that<00:00:49.620> you<00:00:49.920> know

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
kind of flimsiness to it that you know

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.010 
kind of flimsiness to it that you know
but<00:00:50.730> i<00:00:50.760> don't<00:00:51.000> really<00:00:51.090> like<00:00:51.210> but<00:00:51.570> it's<00:00:51.690> not<00:00:51.840> as

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
but i don't really like but it's not as

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.529 
but i don't really like but it's not as
bad<00:00:52.410> as<00:00:52.469> the<00:00:52.860> 57-millimeter<00:00:53.850> one<00:00:54.329> maybe

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
bad as the 57-millimeter one maybe

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:55.970 
bad as the 57-millimeter one maybe
because<00:00:54.780> it's<00:00:54.960> small<00:00:55.199> and<00:00:55.230> design<00:00:55.680> so

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
because it's small and design so

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.619 
because it's small and design so
something<00:00:56.520> to<00:00:56.699> do<00:00:56.789> with<00:00:56.910> that<00:00:57.059> maybe<00:00:57.300> i'm<00:00:57.480> not

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
something to do with that maybe i'm not

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:01.549 
something to do with that maybe i'm not
too<00:00:57.750> sure<00:00:57.780> oh<00:00:58.170> yeah<00:00:59.960> performance<00:01:00.960> is<00:01:01.079> really

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
too sure oh yeah performance is really

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.460 
too sure oh yeah performance is really
really<00:01:01.710> nice<00:01:01.949> and<00:01:02.280> corner<00:01:03.180> cutting<00:01:03.390> it<00:01:04.290> does

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
really nice and corner cutting it does

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.200 
really nice and corner cutting it does
your<00:01:04.619> standard<00:01:04.920> corner-cutting<00:01:05.309> reverse

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
your standard corner-cutting reverse

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.260 
your standard corner-cutting reverse
everything<00:01:06.530> having<00:01:07.530> any<00:01:07.799> pops<00:01:08.040> but<00:01:08.939> the<00:01:09.030> thing

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
everything having any pops but the thing

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.480 
everything having any pops but the thing
is<00:01:09.299> once<00:01:09.900> you<00:01:10.080> start<00:01:10.500> doing<00:01:10.650> solves<00:01:11.250> on<00:01:11.369> this

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
is once you start doing solves on this

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.270 
is once you start doing solves on this
cube<00:01:11.790> it<00:01:12.780> kind<00:01:13.110> of<00:01:13.200> has<00:01:13.380> that<00:01:13.409> catchy<00:01:13.890> kind<00:01:14.220> of

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
cube it kind of has that catchy kind of

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.340 
cube it kind of has that catchy kind of
feeling<00:01:14.610> after<00:01:15.119> a<00:01:15.150> while<00:01:15.540> because<00:01:15.810> I<00:01:16.140> don't

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
feeling after a while because I don't

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:17.899 
feeling after a while because I don't
really<00:01:16.380> know<00:01:16.650> why<00:01:16.830> it<00:01:16.890> is<00:01:17.040> but<00:01:17.100> it<00:01:17.640> doesn't

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
really know why it is but it doesn't

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.670 
really know why it is but it doesn't
catch<00:01:18.090> was<00:01:18.330> it<00:01:18.479> has<00:01:18.630> that<00:01:18.780> kind<00:01:19.049> of<00:01:19.170> catch<00:01:19.470> you

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
catch was it has that kind of catch you

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.590 
catch was it has that kind of catch you
feeling<00:01:20.070> it<00:01:20.159> once<00:01:20.369> the<00:01:20.490> catch<00:01:20.670> but<00:01:21.450> that's

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
feeling it once the catch but that's

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.120 
feeling it once the catch but that's
just<00:01:21.720> yeah<00:01:22.080> that's<00:01:22.350> just<00:01:22.409> me<00:01:22.619> maybe<00:01:22.830> it's<00:01:23.009> my

just yeah that's just me maybe it's my

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
turning style I'm not too sure but other

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.080 
turning style I'm not too sure but other
than<00:01:25.439> that<00:01:25.520> it's<00:01:26.520> really<00:01:26.700> nice<00:01:26.820> so<00:01:27.030> I

long<00:01:28.890> and<00:01:29.130> just<00:01:29.280> looped<00:01:29.700> internals<00:01:30.420> and<00:01:30.540> leave

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
long and just looped internals and leave

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.230 
long and just looped internals and leave
the<00:01:31.170> pieces<00:01:31.890> with<00:01:32.189> like<00:01:32.369> Mara<00:01:32.640> luba<00:01:32.970> something

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
the pieces with like Mara luba something

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.390 
the pieces with like Mara luba something
on<00:01:33.299> the<00:01:33.360> factory<00:01:33.659> loop<00:01:33.840> and<00:01:34.020> just<00:01:34.619> works<00:01:34.979> just

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
on the factory loop and just works just

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.520 
on the factory loop and just works just
fine<00:01:35.670> and<00:01:36.060> I'm<00:01:36.240> really<00:01:36.540> liking<00:01:36.840> it<00:01:37.079> so<00:01:37.200> I<00:01:37.350> wish
