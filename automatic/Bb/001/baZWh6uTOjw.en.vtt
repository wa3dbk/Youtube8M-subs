00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
consider a higher class and on top of

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.750 
consider a higher class and on top of
that<00:01:04.290> and<00:01:04.650> then<00:01:04.800> found<00:01:05.010> this<00:01:05.190> really<00:01:05.430> really

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
that and then found this really really

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.220 
that and then found this really really
interesting<00:01:05.940> is<00:01:06.630> that<00:01:06.690> there's<00:01:07.170> a

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:07.230 
interesting is that there's a

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:08.660 
interesting is that there's a
hundred-dollar<00:01:07.590> bill<00:01:07.950> and<00:01:08.250> he's<00:01:08.460> actually

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
hundred-dollar bill and he's actually

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.840 
hundred-dollar bill and he's actually
holding<00:01:09.480> on<00:01:09.720> to<00:01:09.990> the<00:01:10.110> to<00:01:10.460> 1000<00:01:11.460> and<00:01:11.610> twenty

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
holding on to the to 1000 and twenty

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.060 
holding on to the to 1000 and twenty
dollar<00:01:12.000> bills<00:01:12.090> as<00:01:12.480> if<00:01:12.870> he's<00:01:13.020> puppeteers<00:01:13.830> is

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
dollar bills as if he's puppeteers is

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.100 
dollar bills as if he's puppeteers is
controlling<00:01:14.700> these<00:01:14.820> two<00:01:15.090> and<00:01:15.540> I<00:01:15.750> think<00:01:15.960> that

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
controlling these two and I think that

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.170 
controlling these two and I think that
this<00:01:16.230> is<00:01:16.290> really<00:01:17.040> symbolic<00:01:17.460> of<00:01:17.790> a<00:01:17.880> lot<00:01:18.030> of

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
this is really symbolic of a lot of

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:19.850 
this is really symbolic of a lot of
things<00:01:18.360> that<00:01:18.450> we<00:01:18.660> see<00:01:18.900> in<00:01:19.110> our<00:01:19.530> world<00:01:19.740> today

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
things that we see in our world today

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.680 
things that we see in our world today
where<00:01:20.070> a<00:01:20.490> lot<00:01:20.790> of<00:01:20.820> people<00:01:21.210> that<00:01:21.360> are<00:01:21.510> in

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:21.690 
where a lot of people that are in

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:23.690 
where a lot of people that are in
positions<00:01:22.080> of<00:01:22.170> power<00:01:22.230> or<00:01:22.680> because<00:01:22.860> wealth<00:01:23.430> are

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
positions of power or because wealth are

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.880 
positions of power or because wealth are
being<00:01:23.970> controlled<00:01:24.210> sometimes<00:01:24.930> by<00:01:25.230> other

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
being controlled sometimes by other

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.380 
being controlled sometimes by other
factors<00:01:26.130> that<00:01:26.430> other<00:01:26.700> people<00:01:26.970> don't<00:01:27.060> often

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
factors that other people don't often

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.930 
factors that other people don't often

tree and this is by the fairless high
school<00:01:39.960> india<00:01:40.350> team<00:01:40.500> and<00:01:40.770> i<00:01:40.830> thought<00:01:41.010> that

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
school india team and i thought that

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.100 
school india team and i thought that
this<00:01:41.370> was<00:01:41.550> really<00:01:41.820> good<00:01:42.000> because<00:01:42.630> I<00:01:42.900> almost

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
this was really good because I almost

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.460 
this was really good because I almost
shows<00:01:43.410> none<00:01:44.250> almost<00:01:44.610> literally<00:01:45.150> shows<00:01:45.470> two

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
shows none almost literally shows two

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.410 
shows none almost literally shows two
different<00:01:46.800> aspects<00:01:47.130> of<00:01:47.220> our<00:01:47.340> world<00:01:47.580> so

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
different aspects of our world so

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:49.970 
different aspects of our world so
there's<00:01:48.600> a<00:01:48.660> tree<00:01:48.900> in<00:01:48.930> the<00:01:49.080> middle<00:01:49.200> on<00:01:49.440> one<00:01:49.680> side

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:49.980 
there's a tree in the middle on one side

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:51.650 
there's a tree in the middle on one side
you<00:01:50.280> can<00:01:50.520> see<00:01:50.550> that<00:01:50.910> there's<00:01:51.090> nature<00:01:51.480> and

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:51.660 
you can see that there's nature and

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:53.540 
you can see that there's nature and
there's<00:01:52.200> leaves<00:01:52.620> on<00:01:52.860> the<00:01:52.950> tree<00:01:53.190> but<00:01:53.310> on<00:01:53.430> the

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:53.550 
there's leaves on the tree but on the

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:55.190 
there's leaves on the tree but on the
other<00:01:53.670> side<00:01:53.970> there's<00:01:54.210> no<00:01:54.360> leaves<00:01:54.630> on<00:01:54.720> the<00:01:54.870> tree

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
other side there's no leaves on the tree

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.800 
other side there's no leaves on the tree
it<00:01:55.650> is<00:01:55.800> also<00:01:55.980> a<00:01:56.130> city<00:01:56.520> and<00:01:56.790> eats<00:01:57.420> you<00:01:57.540> smoke

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
it is also a city and eats you smoke

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.300 
it is also a city and eats you smoke
around<00:01:58.050> the<00:01:58.230> city<00:01:58.470> which<00:01:58.650> symbolizes

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
around the city which symbolizes

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:00.830 
around the city which symbolizes
industry<00:01:59.880> and<00:02:00.180> I<00:02:00.240> think<00:02:00.450> this<00:02:00.570> is<00:02:00.660> really

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
industry and I think this is really

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.180 
industry and I think this is really
interesting<00:02:01.050> because<00:02:01.350> a<00:02:01.590> lot<00:02:01.800> of<00:02:01.830> the<00:02:01.950> money

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:02.190 
interesting because a lot of the money

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:05.420 
interesting because a lot of the money
that<00:02:02.340> is<00:02:03.260> generated<00:02:04.260> in<00:02:04.380> our<00:02:04.560> world<00:02:04.830> comes

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
that is generated in our world comes

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.119 
that is generated in our world comes
from<00:02:05.670> this<00:02:05.820> industry<00:02:06.570> and<00:02:06.810> as<00:02:07.350> a<00:02:07.380> significant

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
from this industry and as a significant

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:10.669 
from this industry and as a significant
compromise<00:02:08.549> that<00:02:08.789> industry<00:02:09.329> makes<00:02:09.659> if<00:02:10.079> it's

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
compromise that industry makes if it's

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:12.530 
compromise that industry makes if it's
used<00:02:10.890> to<00:02:11.009> build<00:02:11.340> and<00:02:11.609> that's<00:02:11.760> our<00:02:11.969> environment

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
used to build and that's our environment

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:13.150 
used to build and that's our environment
and<00:02:12.659> it's

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160 
and it's

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.010 
and it's
really<00:02:13.370> really<00:02:13.550> cool<00:02:13.790> to<00:02:14.000> see<00:02:14.060> that<00:02:14.330> all<00:02:14.660> the

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:15.020 
really really cool to see that all the

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:16.450 
really really cool to see that all the
leaves<00:02:15.200> are<00:02:15.470> gone<00:02:15.620> and<00:02:15.830> the<00:02:15.920> branches<00:02:16.340> are

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:16.460 
leaves are gone and the branches are

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:18.460 
leaves are gone and the branches are
about<00:02:17.300> to<00:02:17.450> crack<00:02:17.690> in<00:02:17.900> it<00:02:17.960> and<00:02:18.170> it<00:02:18.260> really

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:18.470 
about to crack in it and it really

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:20.530 
about to crack in it and it really
symbolizes<00:02:18.980> that<00:02:19.160> we're<00:02:19.460> sacrificing<00:02:19.790> our

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:20.540 
symbolizes that we're sacrificing our

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:22.720 
symbolizes that we're sacrificing our
environment<00:02:21.200> in<00:02:21.290> nature<00:02:21.710> to<00:02:21.920> build<00:02:22.580> these

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:22.730 
environment in nature to build these

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:24.790 
environment in nature to build these
massive<00:02:23.180> buildings<00:02:23.630> you<00:02:24.170> know<00:02:24.260> better<00:02:24.500> build
