00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:06.250 
for my son the fourth step is to power

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:09.690 
for my son the fourth step is to power
up<00:02:07.259> once<00:02:08.259> I'm<00:02:08.500> in<00:02:08.649> the<00:02:08.770> dip<00:02:08.950> in<00:02:09.160> the<00:02:09.280> knee<00:02:09.429> bend

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:09.700 
up once I'm in the dip in the knee bend

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:12.750 
up once I'm in the dip in the knee bend
position<00:02:10.330> I<00:02:10.479> will<00:02:11.260> power<00:02:11.530> up<00:02:11.980> from<00:02:12.340> the<00:02:12.490> bottom

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760 
position I will power up from the bottom

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:16.170 
position I will power up from the bottom
that<00:02:13.330> up<00:02:13.690> full<00:02:14.500> power<00:02:15.220> and<00:02:15.490> the<00:02:15.610> shot<00:02:15.850> comes

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
that up full power and the shot comes

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:19.740 
that up full power and the shot comes
from<00:02:16.510> the<00:02:16.690> legs<00:02:16.950> so<00:02:17.950> you<00:02:18.010> will<00:02:18.310> dip<00:02:18.820> and<00:02:19.060> power

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
from the legs so you will dip and power

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:24.770 
from the legs so you will dip and power
up<00:02:20.140> for<00:02:20.890> your<00:02:21.010> shot<00:02:22.530> the<00:02:23.530> final<00:02:24.070> step<00:02:24.400> is

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
up for your shot the final step is

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:27.870 
up for your shot the final step is
extension<00:02:25.780> in<00:02:25.900> follow-through<00:02:26.620> this<00:02:27.520> is<00:02:27.730> the

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:27.880 
extension in follow-through this is the

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:30.720 
extension in follow-through this is the
most<00:02:28.120> important<00:02:28.840> step<00:02:29.080> of<00:02:29.410> the<00:02:29.980> shot<00:02:30.280> and<00:02:30.550> the

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730 
most important step of the shot and the

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:32.520 
most important step of the shot and the
most<00:02:30.910> important<00:02:31.330> out<00:02:31.420> of<00:02:31.450> our<00:02:31.630> five<00:02:31.870> steps<00:02:32.260> for

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:32.530 
most important out of our five steps for

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:36.330 
most important out of our five steps for
a<00:02:32.560> proper<00:02:33.100> basketball<00:02:34.060> shot<00:02:34.709> so<00:02:35.709> once<00:02:35.920> I<00:02:36.100> dip

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
a proper basketball shot so once I dip

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:37.770 
a proper basketball shot so once I dip
and<00:02:36.610> I<00:02:36.760> power<00:02:37.090> up

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:37.780 
and I power up

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
and I power up
I<00:02:37.810> will<00:02:38.709> then<00:02:38.860> extend<00:02:39.550> my<00:02:40.420> arms<00:02:41.020> and<00:02:41.230> then

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:41.800 
I will then extend my arms and then

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:46.110 
I will then extend my arms and then
follow<00:02:42.130> through<00:02:42.640> on<00:02:44.700> the<00:02:45.700> follow-through

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.120 
follow through on the follow-through

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:49.530 
follow through on the follow-through
very<00:02:46.780> important<00:02:47.410> I<00:02:47.850> see<00:02:48.850> a<00:02:48.880> lot<00:02:49.150> of<00:02:49.180> players

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:49.540 
very important I see a lot of players

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:51.120 
very important I see a lot of players
who<00:02:49.810> when<00:02:49.959> they<00:02:50.080> follow<00:02:50.320> through<00:02:50.709> their<00:02:50.860> thumb

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:51.130 
who when they follow through their thumb

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:54.780 
who when they follow through their thumb
is<00:02:51.310> out<00:02:51.840> this<00:02:52.840> is<00:02:53.019> not<00:02:53.260> correct<00:02:53.760> when<00:02:54.760> you

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:54.790 
is out this is not correct when you

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:56.670 
is out this is not correct when you
shoot<00:02:55.269> and<00:02:55.510> you<00:02:55.660> follow<00:02:55.930> through<00:02:56.290> you<00:02:56.500> want

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:56.680 
shoot and you follow through you want

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:00.000 
shoot and you follow through you want
your<00:02:56.890> thumb<00:02:57.250> in<00:02:57.610> and<00:02:58.320> you<00:02:59.320> want<00:02:59.560> your<00:02:59.680> four

your thumb in and you want your four

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:04.560 
your thumb in and you want your four
fingers<00:03:00.340> to<00:03:00.850> be<00:03:01.330> spread<00:03:01.690> like<00:03:02.110> this<00:03:02.730> okay<00:03:03.730> kind

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:04.570 
fingers to be spread like this okay kind

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:07.800 
fingers to be spread like this okay kind
of<00:03:04.720> like<00:03:04.930> a<00:03:04.959> stair<00:03:05.380> step<00:03:05.910> the<00:03:06.910> basketball

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:07.810 
of like a stair step the basketball

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:10.830 
of like a stair step the basketball
needs<00:03:08.230> to<00:03:08.500> come<00:03:08.769> off<00:03:08.980> of<00:03:09.190> the<00:03:09.940> index<00:03:10.540> and

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:10.840 
needs to come off of the index and

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:19.480 
important fingers when you are shooting

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:22.770 
important fingers when you are shooting
a<00:03:19.660> basketball<00:03:19.870> so<00:03:20.769> your<00:03:21.730> pointer<00:03:22.180> and<00:03:22.360> your

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:22.780 
a basketball so your pointer and your

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:24.960 
a basketball so your pointer and your

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:24.970 
middle finger that is where the ball

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:26.699 
middle finger that is where the ball
should<00:03:25.000> be<00:03:25.239> coming<00:03:25.660> off<00:03:25.810> on<00:03:26.080> the

00:03:26.699 --> 00:03:26.709 
should be coming off on the

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:29.160 
should be coming off on the
follow-through<00:03:27.390> so<00:03:28.390> if<00:03:28.450> we<00:03:28.540> put<00:03:28.750> this<00:03:28.930> all

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:29.170 
follow-through so if we put this all

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:32.039 
follow-through so if we put this all
together<00:03:29.670> I'm<00:03:30.670> going<00:03:30.910> to<00:03:30.970> show<00:03:31.180> you<00:03:31.239> what

00:03:32.039 --> 00:03:32.049 
together I'm going to show you what

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:34.370 
together I'm going to show you what
we're<00:03:32.230> talking<00:03:32.560> about<00:03:32.620> so<00:03:33.040> catch<00:03:33.549> the<00:03:33.700> past

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:34.380 
we're talking about so catch the past

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:41.089 
we're talking about so catch the past
alignment<00:03:35.380> up<00:03:36.120> follow-through

00:03:41.089 --> 00:03:41.099 

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:44.280 

and<00:03:42.099> that<00:03:42.760> is<00:03:43.030> the<00:03:43.150> five<00:03:43.390> steps<00:03:43.840> to<00:03:43.959> improve

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:44.290 
and that is the five steps to improve

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:48.959 
and that is the five steps to improve
your<00:03:44.409> shooting<00:03:45.720> good<00:03:46.720> luck
