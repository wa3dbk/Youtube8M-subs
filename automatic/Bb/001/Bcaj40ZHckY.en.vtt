00:00:31.309 --> 00:00:36.750
 Saturday in training I saw that bill 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.460
 would have been sick is good at the beginning of 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.160
 coaching he told me 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.720
 called me he talked to me told me that who 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.059
 trusted me and that normally 

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:47.910
 I was going to start the meeting against 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:49.890
 bruges and that's how that's how I 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.290
 learned that I was going to hold before 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.989
 to ride soldiers I had pressure 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:55.890
 but we must go back on the ground 

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:58.830
 I still had some pressure but 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.089
 once I touch the ball I have 

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:02.250
 put a thought to William I believe it's 

00:01:00.089 --> 00:01:03.809
 the press appreciated I had more than 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.129
 pressure I concentrated I got 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.330
 given 100% that I was in full 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.110
 trust it's good I took my 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.900
 responsibilities 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.970
 when the opportunity presented itself I 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:15.000
 tried my luck 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:18.259
 here I tried to give myself to 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.259
 maximum in the service of the team 

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:25.320
 I tell myself that if we did not arrive 

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:27.720
 to the game data in front of the beauties 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.010
 and this Thursday that on the ground paulo 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.990
 did not happen the deal is so go 

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:32.910
 Tuesday of slabs and beauties and I 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.320
 think I did it right 

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:36.060
 teammates told me that I had done 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.140
 a very good match and the proof 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.060
 endure a month the men of the match 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.560
 so I am very happy for my 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.150
 first I gave myself to the maximum 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.130
 I did what I had to do 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.540
 I worked well defensively and 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.740
 offensively I think I brought back 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.030
 more to the team 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.770
 I think it went very well 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:53.230
 this week it will be a little more 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:55.390
 recovery and we need to be ready 

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:57.550
 Thursday against genk it is necessary to take match 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:58.030
 per game and we will try to take 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:00.070
 the six points 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:01.540
 I spent a step but hey I know 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:02.740
 that I still have a lot of work to do 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:05.710
 to do before being a holder 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:07.870
 indisputable so for now I'm 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:10.920
 in confidence and if the coach gives me my 

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:10.920
 luck I grab it again
