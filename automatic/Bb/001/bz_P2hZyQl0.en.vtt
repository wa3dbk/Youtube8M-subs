00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:19.510 
the Omega inner channel so it is spring

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:21.810 
the Omega inner channel so it is spring
and<00:00:19.810> right<00:00:20.200> about<00:00:20.410> now<00:00:20.680> the<00:00:20.740> Knights<00:00:21.250> are<00:00:21.550> in

and right about now the Knights are in

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:25.290 
and right about now the Knights are in
the<00:00:22.480> low<00:00:22.810> 40s<00:00:22.840> and<00:00:23.710> the<00:00:23.770> days<00:00:23.920> are<00:00:24.340> between<00:00:24.790> 50

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:25.300 
the low 40s and the days are between 50

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:27.839 
the low 40s and the days are between 50
and<00:00:25.330> 60<00:00:25.750> which<00:00:25.869> is<00:00:25.990> perfect<00:00:26.650> for<00:00:26.860> one<00:00:27.550> thing

00:00:27.839 --> 00:00:27.849 
and 60 which is perfect for one thing

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:30.620 
and 60 which is perfect for one thing
and<00:00:28.090> that<00:00:28.119> is<00:00:28.750> early<00:00:29.500> spring<00:00:29.680> vegetables<00:00:30.460> and

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
and that is early spring vegetables and

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.119 
and that is early spring vegetables and
specifically<00:00:31.630> lettuce<00:00:32.290> I<00:00:32.439> always<00:00:32.739> have<00:00:32.980> my

00:00:33.119 --> 00:00:33.129 
specifically lettuce I always have my

00:00:33.129 --> 00:00:35.040 
specifically lettuce I always have my
lettuce<00:00:33.430> bed<00:00:33.610> here<00:00:33.850> because<00:00:34.120> it<00:00:34.300> gets<00:00:34.480> just

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:35.050 
lettuce bed here because it gets just

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:37.950 
lettuce bed here because it gets just
about<00:00:35.530> between<00:00:36.070> 5<00:00:36.460> and<00:00:36.670> 6<00:00:36.790> hours<00:00:36.970> of<00:00:37.120> Sun<00:00:37.390> which

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:37.960 
about between 5 and 6 hours of Sun which

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:40.290 
about between 5 and 6 hours of Sun which
is<00:00:38.170> great<00:00:38.710> for<00:00:39.070> lettuce<00:00:39.430> if<00:00:39.699> I<00:00:39.970> plant<00:00:40.150> the

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:40.300 
is great for lettuce if I plant the

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:41.700 
is great for lettuce if I plant the
tomatoes<00:00:40.420> here<00:00:40.900> they<00:00:41.019> have<00:00:41.140> a<00:00:41.170> kind<00:00:41.379> of<00:00:41.500> a<00:00:41.530> hard

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:41.710 
tomatoes here they have a kind of a hard

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:44.340 
tomatoes here they have a kind of a hard
time<00:00:41.949> because<00:00:42.220> they<00:00:42.340> require<00:00:42.640> full<00:00:43.300> Sun<00:00:43.600> which

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:44.350 
time because they require full Sun which

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:46.610 
time because they require full Sun which
is<00:00:44.380> typically<00:00:44.920> between<00:00:45.070> 8<00:00:45.430> and<00:00:45.670> 12<00:00:45.850> hours<00:00:46.059> so

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
is typically between 8 and 12 hours so

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.229 
is typically between 8 and 12 hours so
you<00:00:47.620> want<00:00:47.829> to<00:00:47.890> make<00:00:48.010> sure<00:00:48.040> that<00:00:48.430> the<00:00:48.579> spot<00:00:49.030> you

00:00:49.229 --> 00:00:49.239 
you want to make sure that the spot you

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:52.500 
you want to make sure that the spot you
have<00:00:49.510> gets<00:00:50.320> some<00:00:50.980> shade<00:00:51.460> not<00:00:51.910> a<00:00:51.940> whole<00:00:52.270> lot<00:00:52.480> of

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:52.510 
have gets some shade not a whole lot of

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:53.970 
have gets some shade not a whole lot of
shade<00:00:52.809> but<00:00:52.840> like<00:00:53.200> I<00:00:53.290> said<00:00:53.500> between<00:00:53.620> five<00:00:53.950> and

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:53.980 
shade but like I said between five and

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:56.850 
shade but like I said between five and
six<00:00:54.340> hours<00:00:54.460> of<00:00:54.850> Sun<00:00:55.420> and<00:00:55.660> the<00:00:56.110> rest<00:00:56.320> being<00:00:56.559> in

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:56.860 
six hours of Sun and the rest being in

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:59.340 
six hours of Sun and the rest being in
partial<00:00:57.700> shade<00:00:57.850> or<00:00:58.270> full<00:00:58.570> shade<00:00:58.840> because

00:00:59.340 --> 00:00:59.350 
partial shade or full shade because

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:02.760 
partial shade or full shade because
lettuce<00:01:00.039> does<00:01:00.670> not<00:01:00.850> like<00:01:01.120> the<00:01:01.360> hot<00:01:01.510> Sun<00:01:01.870> there

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:02.770 
lettuce does not like the hot Sun there

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:04.770 
lettuce does not like the hot Sun there
are<00:01:02.890> a<00:01:02.920> couple<00:01:03.070> varieties<00:01:03.340> that<00:01:03.910> can<00:01:04.210> tolerate

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:04.780 
are a couple varieties that can tolerate

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:06.749 
are a couple varieties that can tolerate
it<00:01:05.199> but<00:01:05.440> don't<00:01:05.950> really<00:01:06.280> like<00:01:06.460> it<00:01:06.640> all<00:01:06.729> that

00:01:06.749 --> 00:01:06.759 
it but don't really like it all that

00:01:06.759 --> 00:01:09.749 
it but don't really like it all that
much<00:01:06.960> so<00:01:07.960> we're<00:01:08.590> going<00:01:08.680> to<00:01:08.770> focus<00:01:08.979> on<00:01:09.310> just<00:01:09.670> the

00:01:09.749 --> 00:01:09.759 
much so we're going to focus on just the

00:01:09.759 --> 00:01:12.570 
much so we're going to focus on just the
wide<00:01:10.060> majority<00:01:10.270> of<00:01:10.660> them<00:01:10.780> that<00:01:11.289> like<00:01:11.580> cooler

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:12.580 
wide majority of them that like cooler

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:14.609 
wide majority of them that like cooler
weather<00:01:12.820> and<00:01:13.119> not<00:01:13.750> a<00:01:13.810> whole<00:01:14.020> lot<00:01:14.170> of<00:01:14.200> strong

00:01:14.609 --> 00:01:14.619 
weather and not a whole lot of strong

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:16.710 
weather and not a whole lot of strong
Sun<00:01:15.039> because<00:01:15.789> when<00:01:15.910> they're<00:01:16.030> in<00:01:16.210> hot<00:01:16.510> weather

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:16.720 
Sun because when they're in hot weather

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:18.420 
Sun because when they're in hot weather
and<00:01:17.080> in<00:01:17.439> full<00:01:17.650> Sun<00:01:17.890> they're<00:01:18.100> going<00:01:18.220> to<00:01:18.280> bolt

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:18.430 
and in full Sun they're going to bolt

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:19.980 
and in full Sun they're going to bolt
quicker<00:01:18.729> and<00:01:18.970> it<00:01:19.270> means<00:01:19.390> they<00:01:19.570> get<00:01:19.689> bitter<00:01:19.900> and

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:19.990 
quicker and it means they get bitter and

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:22.500 
quicker and it means they get bitter and
they<00:01:20.229> start<00:01:20.439> to<00:01:20.530> flower<00:01:20.740> so<00:01:21.549> we're<00:01:22.360> going<00:01:22.450> to

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:22.510 
they start to flower so we're going to

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:24.750 
they start to flower so we're going to
start<00:01:22.780> here<00:01:22.960> with<00:01:23.020> the<00:01:23.409> full<00:01:23.740> tutorial<00:01:24.400> on<00:01:24.520> how

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:24.760 
start here with the full tutorial on how

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:27.600 
start here with the full tutorial on how
to<00:01:24.900> plant<00:01:25.900> some<00:01:26.350> lettuce<00:01:26.710> for<00:01:27.100> you<00:01:27.250> for<00:01:27.520> your

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:27.610 
to plant some lettuce for you for your

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:30.030 
to plant some lettuce for you for your
spring<00:01:27.970> garden<00:01:28.560> so<00:01:29.560> the<00:01:29.650> next<00:01:29.799> thing<00:01:29.950> we're

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:30.040 
spring garden so the next thing we're

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:31.950 
spring garden so the next thing we're
going<00:01:30.159> to<00:01:30.220> focus<00:01:30.369> on<00:01:30.640> is<00:01:30.820> the<00:01:31.060> soil<00:01:31.390> the<00:01:31.930> soil

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:31.960 
going to focus on is the soil the soil

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:33.630 
going to focus on is the soil the soil
is<00:01:32.350> really<00:01:32.500> crucial<00:01:32.830> for<00:01:32.979> having<00:01:33.280> a<00:01:33.340> healthy

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:33.640 
is really crucial for having a healthy

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:35.460 
is really crucial for having a healthy
plant<00:01:33.939> so<00:01:34.210> we're<00:01:34.450> going<00:01:34.630> to<00:01:34.750> optimize<00:01:35.020> the

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:35.470 
plant so we're going to optimize the

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:37.859 
plant so we're going to optimize the
soil<00:01:35.710> to<00:01:35.979> grow<00:01:36.100> specifically<00:01:37.030> lettuce<00:01:37.659> in

00:01:37.859 --> 00:01:37.869 
soil to grow specifically lettuce in

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:40.679 
soil to grow specifically lettuce in
this<00:01:38.200> episode<00:01:38.710> so<00:01:38.920> you<00:01:39.430> want<00:01:39.729> your<00:01:39.880> soil<00:01:40.390> to<00:01:40.570> be

00:01:40.679 --> 00:01:40.689 
this episode so you want your soil to be

00:01:40.689 --> 00:01:43.230 
this episode so you want your soil to be
sandy<00:01:41.259> loam<00:01:41.590> if<00:01:41.860> it's<00:01:42.400> clay<00:01:42.729> you<00:01:42.790> need<00:01:43.090> to

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:43.240 
sandy loam if it's clay you need to

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:44.850 
sandy loam if it's clay you need to
start<00:01:43.450> amending<00:01:43.900> it<00:01:44.020> with<00:01:44.200> something<00:01:44.470> because

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:44.860 
start amending it with something because

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:48.210 
start amending it with something because
lettuce<00:01:45.759> has<00:01:46.119> very<00:01:46.540> fine<00:01:47.020> roots<00:01:47.560> and<00:01:47.890> if<00:01:48.130> you

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:48.220 
lettuce has very fine roots and if you

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:50.910 
lettuce has very fine roots and if you
have<00:01:48.369> clay<00:01:48.729> clay<00:01:49.329> tends<00:01:49.570> to<00:01:49.750> compact<00:01:50.229> and<00:01:50.500> does

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:50.920 
have clay clay tends to compact and does

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:51.899 
have clay clay tends to compact and does

don't really grow very well in clay but
lettuce<00:01:55.899> specifically<00:01:56.530> does<00:01:57.009> not<00:01:57.159> like<00:01:57.460> heavy

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:57.909 
lettuce specifically does not like heavy

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:00.450 
lettuce specifically does not like heavy
clay<00:01:58.270> soil<00:01:58.659> just<00:01:59.290> because<00:01:59.560> those<00:01:59.710> very<00:02:00.070> fine

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:00.460 
clay soil just because those very fine

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:03.090 
clay soil just because those very fine
wiry<00:02:00.759> roots<00:02:01.149> so<00:02:01.630> my<00:02:01.810> soil<00:02:02.110> has<00:02:02.619> been<00:02:02.860> amended

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:03.100 
wiry roots so my soil has been amended

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:05.700 
wiry roots so my soil has been amended
about<00:02:03.610> three<00:02:03.939> bags<00:02:04.240> of<00:02:04.509> regular<00:02:05.020> sand<00:02:05.409> I

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:05.710 
about three bags of regular sand I

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:07.170 
about three bags of regular sand I
typically<00:02:06.009> do<00:02:06.159> that<00:02:06.189> every<00:02:06.460> year<00:02:06.700> and<00:02:06.880> then<00:02:07.149> I

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:07.180 
typically do that every year and then I

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:09.810 
typically do that every year and then I
also<00:02:07.360> add<00:02:07.689> on<00:02:07.899> about<00:02:08.709> the<00:02:08.829> same<00:02:09.070> ratio<00:02:09.519> of

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:09.820 
also add on about the same ratio of

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:11.340 
also add on about the same ratio of
compost<00:02:10.299> so<00:02:10.450> three<00:02:10.630> bags<00:02:10.810> of<00:02:10.899> sand<00:02:11.110> and<00:02:11.260> three

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:11.350 
compost so three bags of sand and three

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:14.430 
compost so three bags of sand and three
bags<00:02:11.500> of<00:02:11.590> compost<00:02:11.850> into<00:02:12.850> my<00:02:13.420> lettuce<00:02:14.019> bed<00:02:14.230> and

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440 
bags of compost into my lettuce bed and

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:17.370 
bags of compost into my lettuce bed and
let<00:02:14.890> it's<00:02:15.040> like<00:02:15.280> the<00:02:15.459> pretty<00:02:15.700> neutral<00:02:16.060> pH<00:02:16.390> they

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:17.380 
let it's like the pretty neutral pH they

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:18.990 
let it's like the pretty neutral pH they
can<00:02:17.530> tolerate<00:02:17.739> alkaline<00:02:18.519> but<00:02:18.700> they<00:02:18.790> don't

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.000 
can tolerate alkaline but they don't

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.449 
can tolerate alkaline but they don't
like<00:02:19.180> acidic<00:02:19.600> so<00:02:19.959> if<00:02:20.680> your<00:02:20.800> pH<00:02:21.010> is<00:02:21.310> around

00:02:21.449 --> 00:02:21.459 
like acidic so if your pH is around

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:24.150 
like acidic so if your pH is around
seven<00:02:22.090> your<00:02:22.239> great<00:02:22.540> any<00:02:23.140> higher<00:02:23.379> than<00:02:23.650> seven

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:24.160 
seven your great any higher than seven

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.500 
seven your great any higher than seven
you<00:02:24.489> don't<00:02:24.670> want<00:02:24.819> to<00:02:24.910> go<00:02:25.000> any<00:02:25.150> higher<00:02:25.239> than

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:26.510 
you don't want to go any higher than

you don't want to go any higher than
7.58<00:02:27.510> I<00:02:28.020> wouldn't<00:02:28.349> go<00:02:28.440> any<00:02:28.590> higher<00:02:28.650> than<00:02:28.770> eight

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
7.58 I wouldn't go any higher than eight

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:30.830 
7.58 I wouldn't go any higher than eight
that<00:02:29.610> gets<00:02:29.819> a<00:02:29.880> little<00:02:29.970> too<00:02:30.209> alkaline

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
that gets a little too alkaline

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.660 
that gets a little too alkaline
now<00:02:30.959> the<00:02:31.050> next<00:02:31.230> thing<00:02:31.349> you<00:02:31.560> want<00:02:31.590> is<00:02:31.920> nitrogen

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
now the next thing you want is nitrogen

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:35.059 
now the next thing you want is nitrogen
lettuce<00:02:33.540> are<00:02:33.720> very<00:02:33.959> heavy<00:02:34.319> feeders<00:02:34.739> because

00:02:35.059 --> 00:02:35.069 
lettuce are very heavy feeders because

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:36.680 
lettuce are very heavy feeders because
they're<00:02:35.220> all<00:02:35.370> leaves<00:02:35.700> and<00:02:35.940> typically<00:02:36.569> you're

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
they're all leaves and typically you're

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:38.300 
they're all leaves and typically you're
leafing<00:02:37.110> vegetables<00:02:37.709> are<00:02:37.860> going<00:02:38.040> to<00:02:38.130> be<00:02:38.220> your

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
leafing vegetables are going to be your

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:41.089 
leafing vegetables are going to be your
heaviest<00:02:38.730> nitrogen<00:02:39.300> feeding<00:02:39.750> plants<00:02:40.440> so<00:02:40.980> what

00:02:41.089 --> 00:02:41.099 
heaviest nitrogen feeding plants so what

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:43.970 
heaviest nitrogen feeding plants so what
I<00:02:41.130> have<00:02:41.400> here<00:02:41.430> is<00:02:41.849> just<00:02:42.480> some<00:02:42.630> of<00:02:42.690> my<00:02:43.020> my

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
I have here is just some of my my

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.910 
I have here is just some of my my
trifecta<00:02:44.430> plus<00:02:44.850> it's<00:02:45.290> my<00:02:46.290> own<00:02:46.440> fertilizer

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
trifecta plus it's my own fertilizer

trifecta plus it's my own fertilizer
blend<00:02:47.430> but<00:02:47.640> whatever<00:02:48.000> you<00:02:48.450> choose<00:02:48.720> works<00:02:49.230> as

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
blend but whatever you choose works as

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:51.470 
blend but whatever you choose works as
long<00:02:50.250> as<00:02:50.430> it's<00:02:50.610> a<00:02:50.790> little<00:02:51.000> bit<00:02:51.090> higher<00:02:51.270> in

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
long as it's a little bit higher in

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.540 
long as it's a little bit higher in
nitrogen<00:02:51.870> and<00:02:52.200> you<00:02:52.709> can<00:02:52.860> have<00:02:53.040> other<00:02:53.280> things

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:53.550 
nitrogen and you can have other things

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:55.100 
nitrogen and you can have other things
like<00:02:53.730> phosphorus<00:02:54.269> and<00:02:54.390> potassium<00:02:54.450> and

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.110 
like phosphorus and potassium and

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:56.570 
like phosphorus and potassium and
micronutrients<00:02:55.530> those<00:02:56.069> are<00:02:56.220> going<00:02:56.310> to<00:02:56.370> hurt

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:56.580 
micronutrients those are going to hurt

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:57.979 
micronutrients those are going to hurt
it<00:02:56.700> but<00:02:57.030> the<00:02:57.120> main<00:02:57.300> thing<00:02:57.540> is<00:02:57.660> that<00:02:57.690> you<00:02:57.870> have

00:02:57.979 --> 00:02:57.989 
it but the main thing is that you have

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:01.070 
it but the main thing is that you have
enough<00:02:58.350> nitrogen<00:02:59.250> because<00:02:59.819> um<00:03:00.030> like<00:03:00.989> I<00:03:01.050> said

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:01.080 
enough nitrogen because um like I said

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:02.390 
enough nitrogen because um like I said
without<00:03:01.440> that<00:03:01.650> you're<00:03:02.069> going<00:03:02.190> to<00:03:02.280> have<00:03:02.370> a

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
without that you're going to have a

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:03.800 
without that you're going to have a
stunted<00:03:02.790> plane<00:03:03.000> so<00:03:03.120> next<00:03:03.300> we're<00:03:03.540> gonna<00:03:03.600> do<00:03:03.720> is

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
stunted plane so next we're gonna do is

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:05.930 
stunted plane so next we're gonna do is
we're<00:03:03.959> going<00:03:04.049> to<00:03:04.170> turn<00:03:04.590> over<00:03:04.860> this<00:03:05.459> soil

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:05.940 
we're going to turn over this soil

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:08.840 
we're going to turn over this soil
I<00:03:06.060> always<00:03:06.660> turn<00:03:06.959> it<00:03:07.110> over<00:03:07.230> and<00:03:07.530> it<00:03:08.220> just<00:03:08.489> allows

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:08.850 
I always turn it over and it just allows

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:12.320 
I always turn it over and it just allows
you<00:03:09.090> to<00:03:09.170> have<00:03:10.170> a<00:03:10.560> really<00:03:10.890> loose<00:03:11.370> soil<00:03:11.760> because

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:12.330 
you to have a really loose soil because

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:15.350 
you to have a really loose soil because
over<00:03:12.600> the<00:03:12.690> winter<00:03:13.340> my<00:03:14.340> soil<00:03:14.640> tends<00:03:14.880> to<00:03:15.030> compact

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:15.360 
over the winter my soil tends to compact

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:17.030 
over the winter my soil tends to compact
down<00:03:15.420> even<00:03:15.780> with<00:03:15.870> the<00:03:15.989> sand<00:03:16.230> and<00:03:16.410> stuff<00:03:16.590> now

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 
down even with the sand and stuff now

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:18.259 
down even with the sand and stuff now
you'll<00:03:17.220> notice<00:03:17.400> that<00:03:17.489> when<00:03:17.700> I<00:03:17.730> do<00:03:17.850> turn<00:03:18.150> it

00:03:18.259 --> 00:03:18.269 
you'll notice that when I do turn it

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:21.530 
you'll notice that when I do turn it
over<00:03:18.390> it<00:03:18.690> is<00:03:19.170> very<00:03:19.350> crumbly<00:03:19.980> but<00:03:20.880> it's<00:03:21.000> just<00:03:21.330> to

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
over it is very crumbly but it's just to

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:22.940 
over it is very crumbly but it's just to
turn<00:03:21.720> over<00:03:21.840> any<00:03:22.019> little<00:03:22.380> weeds<00:03:22.560> that<00:03:22.739> are<00:03:22.830> on

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:22.950 
turn over any little weeds that are on

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:25.100 
turn over any little weeds that are on
the<00:03:23.040> top<00:03:23.250> and<00:03:23.489> and<00:03:24.269> just<00:03:24.569> to<00:03:24.660> loosen<00:03:24.810> it<00:03:24.989> up

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:25.110 
the top and and just to loosen it up

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:26.720 
the top and and just to loosen it up
that<00:03:25.319> much<00:03:25.470> more<00:03:25.769> to<00:03:26.100> get<00:03:26.220> ready<00:03:26.430> for<00:03:26.610> planting

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:26.730 
that much more to get ready for planting

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:30.770 
that much more to get ready for planting
and<00:03:27.150> as<00:03:27.720> you<00:03:27.870> can<00:03:27.989> see<00:03:28.250> my<00:03:29.250> shovel<00:03:29.670> easily<00:03:30.630> goes

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:30.780 
and as you can see my shovel easily goes

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:33.229 
and as you can see my shovel easily goes
all<00:03:31.380> the<00:03:31.440> way<00:03:31.709> down<00:03:31.890> if<00:03:32.100> you<00:03:32.579> can't<00:03:32.880> do<00:03:33.060> that

00:03:33.229 --> 00:03:33.239 
all the way down if you can't do that

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:35.390 
all the way down if you can't do that
you<00:03:33.810> want<00:03:34.260> to<00:03:34.440> amend<00:03:34.590> your<00:03:34.769> soil<00:03:34.980> with<00:03:35.250> some

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.400 
you want to amend your soil with some

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:39.860 
you want to amend your soil with some
sand<00:03:35.730> and<00:03:36.030> some<00:03:36.870> compost<00:03:37.260> because<00:03:37.920> I<00:03:38.880> really

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:39.870 
sand and some compost because I really

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:41.750 
sand and some compost because I really
don't<00:03:40.019> have<00:03:40.079> to<00:03:40.290> try<00:03:40.560> very<00:03:40.799> hard<00:03:40.829> to<00:03:41.430> flip<00:03:41.609> the

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:41.760 
don't have to try very hard to flip the

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:43.849 
don't have to try very hard to flip the
soil<00:03:42.000> over<00:03:42.299> and<00:03:42.540> I'll<00:03:43.200> even<00:03:43.320> show<00:03:43.560> you<00:03:43.590> some

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:43.859 
soil over and I'll even show you some

00:03:43.859 --> 00:03:46.370 
soil over and I'll even show you some
compacted<00:03:44.489> stuff<00:03:44.670> right<00:03:44.880> here<00:03:45.090> this<00:03:46.049> is<00:03:46.230> what

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:46.380 
compacted stuff right here this is what

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:50.180 
compacted stuff right here this is what
I<00:03:46.410> consider<00:03:46.530> compacted<00:03:47.420> okay<00:03:48.420> this<00:03:49.140> I<00:03:49.380> can't

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:50.190 
I consider compacted okay this I can't

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:52.160 
I consider compacted okay this I can't
even<00:03:50.340> grab<00:03:50.519> a<00:03:50.820> clump<00:03:51.420> because<00:03:51.630> it's<00:03:51.750> just<00:03:51.930> so

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:52.170 
even grab a clump because it's just so

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:55.099 
even grab a clump because it's just so
it's<00:03:53.040> compacted<00:03:53.670> but<00:03:53.940> it's<00:03:54.060> loose<00:03:54.329> see<00:03:54.989> right

00:03:55.099 --> 00:03:55.109 
it's compacted but it's loose see right

00:03:55.109 --> 00:03:57.380 
it's compacted but it's loose see right
here<00:03:55.260> this<00:03:55.530> is<00:03:55.590> what<00:03:56.280> you<00:03:56.370> consider<00:03:56.549> a<00:03:56.820> ball<00:03:57.120> of

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:57.390 
here this is what you consider a ball of

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:59.979 
here this is what you consider a ball of
compacted<00:03:58.200> soil<00:03:58.470> but<00:03:58.980> if<00:03:59.070> you<00:03:59.160> look<00:03:59.310> at<00:03:59.400> this

00:03:59.979 --> 00:03:59.989 
compacted soil but if you look at this

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:02.390 
compacted soil but if you look at this
there's<00:04:00.989> absolutely<00:04:01.500> no<00:04:01.650> compaction<00:04:02.250> it's

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.400 
there's absolutely no compaction it's

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:06.920 
there's absolutely no compaction it's
just<00:04:02.840> from<00:04:03.840> the<00:04:03.870> the<00:04:04.470> rain<00:04:04.650> and<00:04:04.920> the<00:04:05.519> winter<00:04:05.930> of

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:06.930 
just from the the rain and the winter of

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:08.509 
just from the the rain and the winter of
the<00:04:07.079> weight<00:04:07.230> of<00:04:07.260> the<00:04:07.410> snow<00:04:07.680> kind<00:04:08.040> of<00:04:08.130> packing

00:04:08.509 --> 00:04:08.519 
the weight of the snow kind of packing

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:10.099 
the weight of the snow kind of packing
down<00:04:08.640> the<00:04:08.730> top<00:04:08.940> and<00:04:09.329> I<00:04:09.600> just<00:04:09.750> wanna<00:04:09.900> make<00:04:09.989> sure

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:10.109 
down the top and I just wanna make sure

00:04:10.109 --> 00:04:11.960 
down the top and I just wanna make sure
that<00:04:10.140> it's<00:04:10.380> nice<00:04:10.530> and<00:04:10.590> loose<00:04:10.920> so<00:04:11.760> that<00:04:11.790> the

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:11.970 
that it's nice and loose so that the

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:14.630 
that it's nice and loose so that the
roots<00:04:12.150> can<00:04:12.269> go<00:04:12.480> straight<00:04:12.840> on<00:04:13.140> down<00:04:13.640> and

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:14.640 
roots can go straight on down and

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:16.250 
roots can go straight on down and
obviously<00:04:15.060> as<00:04:15.299> you<00:04:15.420> can<00:04:15.569> see<00:04:15.750> I'm<00:04:15.840> working<00:04:15.989> my

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:16.260 
obviously as you can see I'm working my

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.710 
obviously as you can see I'm working my
way<00:04:16.310> backwards<00:04:17.310> so<00:04:17.880> that<00:04:17.910> I'm<00:04:18.120> not<00:04:18.299> stepping

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:18.720 
way backwards so that I'm not stepping

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:23.350 
way backwards so that I'm not stepping
on<00:04:18.959> what<00:04:19.169> I<00:04:19.200> just<00:04:19.500> loosened

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:23.360 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:26.850 

and<00:04:23.720> another<00:04:24.139> tip<00:04:24.470> for<00:04:24.710> your<00:04:25.180> lettuce<00:04:26.180> bed<00:04:26.360> is

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:26.860 
and another tip for your lettuce bed is

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:29.050 
and another tip for your lettuce bed is
if<00:04:27.860> you<00:04:27.949> want<00:04:28.099> to<00:04:28.159> plant<00:04:28.400> some<00:04:28.580> other<00:04:28.729> things

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:29.060 
if you want to plant some other things

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:34.170 
if you want to plant some other things
like<00:04:29.990> asparagus<00:04:30.979> and<00:04:31.780> cabbage<00:04:32.780> and<00:04:33.159> spinach

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:34.180 
like asparagus and cabbage and spinach

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:36.850 
like asparagus and cabbage and spinach
they<00:04:35.180> also<00:04:35.330> do<00:04:35.569> very<00:04:35.750> well<00:04:35.810> in<00:04:36.139> alkaline<00:04:36.530> soil

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:36.860 
they also do very well in alkaline soil

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:38.379 
they also do very well in alkaline soil
so<00:04:37.430> one<00:04:37.580> of<00:04:37.639> the<00:04:37.729> things<00:04:37.879> that<00:04:38.060> I'll<00:04:38.150> do<00:04:38.360> is

00:04:38.379 --> 00:04:38.389 
so one of the things that I'll do is

00:04:38.389 --> 00:04:41.770 
so one of the things that I'll do is
when<00:04:38.599> I<00:04:38.629> plant<00:04:39.189> you<00:04:40.189> can<00:04:40.340> plant<00:04:40.639> stuff<00:04:40.909> that

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:41.780 
when I plant you can plant stuff that

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:43.300 
when I plant you can plant stuff that
does<00:04:41.990> well<00:04:42.199> and<00:04:42.319> up<00:04:42.439> line<00:04:42.650> soil<00:04:42.979> because<00:04:43.219> if

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:43.310 
does well and up line soil because if

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:44.950 
does well and up line soil because if
you<00:04:43.370> were<00:04:43.430> to<00:04:43.520> plant<00:04:43.729> tomatoes<00:04:44.120> you<00:04:44.750> wouldn't

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:44.960 
you were to plant tomatoes you wouldn't

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:45.730 
you were to plant tomatoes you wouldn't
really<00:04:45.050> have<00:04:45.139> a<00:04:45.259> whole<00:04:45.379> lot<00:04:45.500> of<00:04:45.530> success

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:45.740 
really have a whole lot of success

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:48.219 
really have a whole lot of success
because<00:04:46.460> tomato<00:04:46.759> is<00:04:46.849> like<00:04:46.939> acidic<00:04:47.180> soil<00:04:47.509> so<00:04:48.199> I

00:04:48.219 --> 00:04:48.229 
because tomato is like acidic soil so I

00:04:48.229 --> 00:04:49.510 
because tomato is like acidic soil so I
try<00:04:48.409> to<00:04:48.469> plant<00:04:48.740> things<00:04:48.889> that<00:04:49.129> go<00:04:49.280> well

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:49.520 
try to plant things that go well

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:51.850 
try to plant things that go well
together<00:04:49.729> in<00:04:50.090> that<00:04:50.419> type<00:04:50.629> of<00:04:50.659> pH<00:04:51.050> that<00:04:51.680> way<00:04:51.830> I

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:51.860 
together in that type of pH that way I

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:54.040 
together in that type of pH that way I
can<00:04:52.039> optimize<00:04:52.400> my<00:04:52.550> space<00:04:52.879> because<00:04:53.240> lettuce<00:04:53.900> is

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:54.050 
can optimize my space because lettuce is

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:56.050 
can optimize my space because lettuce is
only<00:04:54.169> good<00:04:54.379> for<00:04:54.530> the<00:04:54.590> springtime<00:04:54.860> and<00:04:55.310> after

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:56.060 
only good for the springtime and after

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:57.969 
only good for the springtime and after
that<00:04:56.210> I<00:04:56.449> don't<00:04:57.080> wanna<00:04:57.289> just<00:04:57.349> have<00:04:57.530> an<00:04:57.590> open<00:04:57.680> bed

00:04:57.969 --> 00:04:57.979 
that I don't wanna just have an open bed

00:04:57.979 --> 00:05:00.809 
that I don't wanna just have an open bed
so<00:04:58.490> I<00:04:58.819> typically<00:04:59.539> will<00:04:59.719> plan<00:05:00.020> things<00:05:00.379> out

00:05:00.809 --> 00:05:00.819 
so I typically will plan things out

00:05:00.819 --> 00:05:04.149 
so I typically will plan things out
accordingly<00:05:01.819> so<00:05:02.719> that<00:05:02.900> when<00:05:03.530> my<00:05:03.650> lettuce<00:05:04.009> is

00:05:04.149 --> 00:05:04.159 
accordingly so that when my lettuce is

00:05:04.159 --> 00:05:05.140 
accordingly so that when my lettuce is
ready<00:05:04.370> to<00:05:04.460> be<00:05:04.550> harvested

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:05.150 
ready to be harvested

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:07.600 
ready to be harvested
I<00:05:05.180> can<00:05:05.990> have<00:05:06.139> a<00:05:06.169> plant<00:05:06.469> that<00:05:06.800> can<00:05:07.280> do<00:05:07.400> all<00:05:07.520> in

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:07.610 
I can have a plant that can do all in

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:10.119 
I can have a plant that can do all in
the<00:05:07.699> summer<00:05:07.909> ready<00:05:08.870> to<00:05:09.020> go<00:05:09.169> and<00:05:09.440> that<00:05:10.069> will

00:05:10.119 --> 00:05:10.129 
the summer ready to go and that will

00:05:10.129 --> 00:05:11.950 
the summer ready to go and that will
completely<00:05:10.430> be<00:05:10.639> like<00:05:10.819> my<00:05:10.940> cabbages

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:11.960 
completely be like my cabbages

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:16.089 
completely be like my cabbages
I<00:05:12.020> also<00:05:12.680> winter<00:05:13.250> plant<00:05:13.550> my<00:05:14.360> spinach<00:05:15.289> with<00:05:15.919> my

00:05:16.089 --> 00:05:16.099 
I also winter plant my spinach with my

00:05:16.099 --> 00:05:19.629 
I also winter plant my spinach with my
lettuce<00:05:16.400> because<00:05:17.029> of<00:05:17.180> the<00:05:17.240> fact<00:05:17.479> that<00:05:17.719> um<00:05:18.639> the

00:05:19.629 --> 00:05:19.639 
lettuce because of the fact that um the

00:05:19.639 --> 00:05:21.850 
lettuce because of the fact that um the
dispatch<00:05:20.509> is<00:05:20.539> also<00:05:20.960> an<00:05:21.080> early<00:05:21.349> spring<00:05:21.469> crop

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:21.860 
dispatch is also an early spring crop

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:24.429 
dispatch is also an early spring crop
but<00:05:22.580> it's<00:05:22.729> it<00:05:23.000> doesn't<00:05:23.990> take<00:05:24.080> up<00:05:24.169> a<00:05:24.229> lot<00:05:24.259> of

00:05:24.429 --> 00:05:24.439 
but it's it doesn't take up a lot of

00:05:24.439 --> 00:05:29.019 
but it's it doesn't take up a lot of
space<00:05:24.680> at<00:05:24.860> all<00:05:25.039> so<00:05:27.550> all<00:05:28.550> right<00:05:28.669> next<00:05:28.819> what<00:05:28.969> I'm

00:05:29.019 --> 00:05:29.029 
space at all so all right next what I'm

you<00:05:43.849> have<00:05:44.440> and<00:05:45.440> I<00:05:46.400> typically<00:05:46.819> just<00:05:47.029> sprinkle

00:05:47.999 --> 00:05:48.009 
you have and I typically just sprinkle

00:05:48.009 --> 00:05:52.659 
you have and I typically just sprinkle
you<00:05:49.009> know<00:05:49.099> about<00:05:49.279> a<00:05:49.310> cup<00:05:49.610> over<00:05:50.240> I<00:05:51.550> mean<00:05:52.550> I<00:05:52.639> I

00:05:52.659 --> 00:05:52.669 
you know about a cup over I mean I I

00:05:52.669 --> 00:05:54.790 
you know about a cup over I mean I I
don't<00:05:52.879> really<00:05:53.210> measure<00:05:54.080> this<00:05:54.349> out<00:05:54.500> all<00:05:54.650> that

00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:54.800 
don't really measure this out all that

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:57.939 
don't really measure this out all that
much<00:05:54.979> but<00:05:55.849> if<00:05:56.150> I<00:05:56.330> were<00:05:56.449> to<00:05:56.479> say<00:05:56.750> for<00:05:57.680> a<00:05:57.710> specific

00:05:57.939 --> 00:05:57.949 
much but if I were to say for a specific

00:05:57.949 --> 00:06:01.379 
much but if I were to say for a specific
measurement<00:05:58.460> I'd<00:05:58.909> say<00:05:59.150> about<00:05:59.240> a<00:05:59.389> cup<00:06:00.219> over

00:06:01.379 --> 00:06:01.389 
measurement I'd say about a cup over

00:06:01.389 --> 00:06:04.659 
measurement I'd say about a cup over
three<00:06:02.389> or<00:06:02.479> four<00:06:02.629> square<00:06:02.960> feet<00:06:02.990> maybe<00:06:03.860> five

00:06:04.659 --> 00:06:04.669 
three or four square feet maybe five

00:06:04.669 --> 00:06:07.119 
three or four square feet maybe five
square<00:06:05.000> feet<00:06:05.169> not<00:06:06.169> a<00:06:06.229> whole<00:06:06.469> lot<00:06:06.680> of<00:06:06.710> science

00:06:07.119 --> 00:06:07.129 
square feet not a whole lot of science

00:06:07.129 --> 00:06:10.089 
square feet not a whole lot of science
there<00:06:07.339> because<00:06:08.620> like<00:06:09.620> I<00:06:09.680> said<00:06:09.770> it's<00:06:09.979> an

00:06:10.089 --> 00:06:10.099 
there because like I said it's an

00:06:10.099 --> 00:06:11.680 
there because like I said it's an
organic<00:06:10.490> fertilizer<00:06:10.669> so<00:06:11.270> you<00:06:11.360> can't<00:06:11.569> really

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:11.690 
organic fertilizer so you can't really

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:13.689 
organic fertilizer so you can't really
burn<00:06:11.930> it<00:06:12.080> it's<00:06:12.650> got<00:06:12.740> a<00:06:12.770> lot<00:06:12.949> of<00:06:13.069> calcium<00:06:13.250> in<00:06:13.639> it

00:06:13.689 --> 00:06:13.699 
burn it it's got a lot of calcium in it

00:06:13.699 --> 00:06:17.499 
burn it it's got a lot of calcium in it
so<00:06:14.060> that's<00:06:14.479> good<00:06:14.659> for<00:06:14.930> those<00:06:14.990> plants<00:06:15.409> and<00:06:16.509> then

00:06:17.499 --> 00:06:17.509 
so that's good for those plants and then

00:06:17.509 --> 00:06:19.420 
so that's good for those plants and then
I<00:06:17.569> just<00:06:17.719> rank<00:06:17.930> it<00:06:18.050> into<00:06:18.229> the<00:06:18.349> top<00:06:18.529> layer<00:06:19.400> of

00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:19.430 
I just rank it into the top layer of

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:21.399 
I just rank it into the top layer of
soil<00:06:19.940> here<00:06:20.330> where<00:06:20.870> the<00:06:20.990> roots<00:06:21.139> are<00:06:21.229> going<00:06:21.289> to

00:06:21.399 --> 00:06:21.409 
soil here where the roots are going to

00:06:21.409 --> 00:06:23.439 
soil here where the roots are going to
come<00:06:21.500> in<00:06:21.589> contact<00:06:21.620> with<00:06:22.159> it<00:06:22.370> and<00:06:22.909> that<00:06:23.300> also

00:06:23.439 --> 00:06:23.449 
come in contact with it and that also

00:06:23.449 --> 00:06:24.700 
come in contact with it and that also
kind<00:06:23.719> of<00:06:23.779> breaks<00:06:23.960> up<00:06:24.110> those<00:06:24.289> extra<00:06:24.620> little

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:24.710 
kind of breaks up those extra little

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:26.709 
kind of breaks up those extra little
clumps<00:06:25.129> there<00:06:25.310> helps<00:06:26.210> just<00:06:26.389> make<00:06:26.509> it<00:06:26.629> that

00:06:26.709 --> 00:06:26.719 
clumps there helps just make it that

00:06:26.719 --> 00:06:30.490 
clumps there helps just make it that
much<00:06:26.779> looser

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:30.500 

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:35.450 

and<00:06:31.500> we're<00:06:32.160> almost<00:06:32.280> ready<00:06:32.520> to<00:06:32.640> plant<00:06:34.370> so<00:06:35.370> we're

00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:35.460 
and we're almost ready to plant so we're

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:37.340 
and we're almost ready to plant so we're
just<00:06:35.490> planting<00:06:36.060> the<00:06:36.210> speckled<00:06:36.780> lettuce<00:06:37.110> and

00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:37.350 
just planting the speckled lettuce and

00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:40.130 
just planting the speckled lettuce and
it<00:06:38.220> looks<00:06:38.430> so<00:06:38.940> unique<00:06:39.510> and<00:06:39.780> it's<00:06:39.900> very

00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:40.140 
it looks so unique and it's very

00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:42.920 
it looks so unique and it's very
interesting<00:06:40.620> it<00:06:41.010> tastes<00:06:41.340> great<00:06:41.490> too<00:06:41.570> so<00:06:42.570> we

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:42.930 
interesting it tastes great too so we

00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:45.080 
interesting it tastes great too so we
have<00:06:43.110> a<00:06:43.140> plant<00:06:43.440> here<00:06:43.800> and<00:06:44.100> we<00:06:44.520> want<00:06:44.730> to<00:06:44.790> plant

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:45.090 
have a plant here and we want to plant

00:06:45.090 --> 00:06:47.390 
have a plant here and we want to plant
about<00:06:45.510> anywhere<00:06:46.230> between<00:06:46.350> five<00:06:46.860> and<00:06:46.890> six

00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:47.400 
about anywhere between five and six

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:50.570 
about anywhere between five and six
inches<00:06:47.900> behind<00:06:48.900> that<00:06:49.350> so<00:06:49.710> we<00:06:50.160> have<00:06:50.250> a<00:06:50.280> plant

00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:50.580 
inches behind that so we have a plant

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:52.580 
inches behind that so we have a plant
over<00:06:50.670> here<00:06:51.180> and<00:06:51.360> plant<00:06:51.570> right<00:06:51.690> here<00:06:51.720> a<00:06:52.230> plant

00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:52.590 
over here and plant right here a plant

00:06:52.590 --> 00:06:55.910 
over here and plant right here a plant
right<00:06:52.710> here<00:06:53.010> and<00:06:53.240> then<00:06:54.240> that<00:06:54.420> way<00:06:54.660> they<00:06:55.500> can

00:06:55.910 --> 00:06:55.920 
right here and then that way they can

00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:57.500 
right here and then that way they can
grow<00:06:56.130> up<00:06:56.160> and<00:06:56.490> be<00:06:56.670> nice<00:06:56.850> and<00:06:57.090> full<00:06:57.210> and<00:06:57.330> you<00:06:57.390> can

00:06:57.500 --> 00:06:57.510 
grow up and be nice and full and you can

00:06:57.510 --> 00:07:00.020 
grow up and be nice and full and you can
use<00:06:57.630> your<00:06:57.750> space<00:06:58.020> more<00:06:58.650> efficiently<00:06:58.940> now<00:06:59.940> the

00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:00.030 
use your space more efficiently now the

00:07:00.030 --> 00:07:01.580 
use your space more efficiently now the
thing<00:07:00.240> is<00:07:00.270> with<00:07:00.540> the<00:07:00.690> speckled<00:07:01.200> lettuce<00:07:01.440> is

00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:01.590 
thing is with the speckled lettuce is

00:07:01.590 --> 00:07:03.800 
thing is with the speckled lettuce is
it's<00:07:01.770> not<00:07:01.890> really<00:07:02.070> a<00:07:02.160> head<00:07:02.430> variety<00:07:02.850> it's<00:07:03.060> not

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:03.810 
it's not really a head variety it's not

00:07:03.810 --> 00:07:08.150 
it's not really a head variety it's not
really<00:07:04.200> it's<00:07:04.980> not<00:07:05.070> really<00:07:05.190> a<00:07:06.170> leaf<00:07:07.170> variety<00:07:07.680> so

00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:08.160 
really it's not really a leaf variety so

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:10.090 
really it's not really a leaf variety so
it's<00:07:08.280> kind<00:07:08.460> of<00:07:08.490> a<00:07:08.580> little<00:07:08.730> bit<00:07:08.850> in<00:07:08.940> between<00:07:09.000> and

00:07:10.090 --> 00:07:10.100 
it's kind of a little bit in between and

00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:13.820 
it's kind of a little bit in between and
and<00:07:11.100> so<00:07:12.000> the<00:07:12.480> outside<00:07:12.630> leaves<00:07:13.170> can<00:07:13.410> be<00:07:13.440> used<00:07:13.650> as

00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:13.830 
and so the outside leaves can be used as

00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:17.240 
and so the outside leaves can be used as
leaf<00:07:14.790> lettuce<00:07:15.060> and<00:07:15.300> then<00:07:16.020> as<00:07:16.170> it<00:07:16.320> forms<00:07:16.890> it

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:17.250 
leaf lettuce and then as it forms it

00:07:17.250 --> 00:07:19.520 
leaf lettuce and then as it forms it
also<00:07:17.550> forms<00:07:17.910> kind<00:07:18.120> of<00:07:18.210> a<00:07:18.330> head<00:07:18.660> so<00:07:19.290> you<00:07:19.380> can

00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:19.530 
also forms kind of a head so you can

00:07:19.530 --> 00:07:22.610 
also forms kind of a head so you can
harness<00:07:20.370> it<00:07:20.610> as<00:07:20.730> a<00:07:21.000> as<00:07:21.180> a<00:07:21.240> whole<00:07:21.570> as<00:07:21.810> well<00:07:21.960> so

00:07:22.610 --> 00:07:22.620 
harness it as a as a whole as well so

00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:23.960 
harness it as a as a whole as well so
what<00:07:23.130> we're<00:07:23.250> going<00:07:23.370> to<00:07:23.430> do<00:07:23.580> is<00:07:23.790> we're<00:07:23.940> just

00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:23.970 
what we're going to do is we're just

00:07:23.970 --> 00:07:25.390
