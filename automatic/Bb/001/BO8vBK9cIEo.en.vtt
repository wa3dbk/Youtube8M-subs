00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:12.490 
eaten which is understandable but still

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:17.880

kind of blackish tinge to it but it's

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:24.240 
kind of blackish tinge to it but it's
hard<00:03:22.960> to<00:03:23.080> pinpoint<00:03:23.260> where<00:03:23.740> because<00:03:24.040> it<00:03:24.160> just

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:24.250 
hard to pinpoint where because it just

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:26.370 
hard to pinpoint where because it just
blends<00:03:24.520> so<00:03:24.730> low<00:03:24.790> they're<00:03:25.120> purple<00:03:25.570> hair<00:03:25.750> then

on the side she has like a red bright

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:29.880 
on the side she has like a red bright
red<00:03:28.630> streak<00:03:29.050> but<00:03:29.230> it<00:03:29.350> goes<00:03:29.500> really<00:03:29.710> nicely

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:29.890 
red streak but it goes really nicely

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:33.060 
red streak but it goes really nicely
with<00:03:30.430> her<00:03:30.580> hairstyle<00:03:31.290> and<00:03:32.290> that<00:03:32.710> she<00:03:32.860> has<00:03:32.980> her
