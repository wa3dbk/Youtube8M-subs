00:00:41.259 --> 00:00:41.269 
hear this actually activate in the

00:00:41.269 --> 00:00:43.540 
hear this actually activate in the
solenoid<00:00:41.539> so<00:00:42.170> you<00:00:42.260> know<00:00:42.410> this<00:00:42.649> is<00:00:42.859> working<00:00:43.129> so

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:43.550 
solenoid so you know this is working so

00:00:45.849 --> 00:00:45.859 
this and you can get the key out but the

00:00:45.859 --> 00:00:47.080 
this and you can get the key out but the
other<00:00:46.010> one<00:00:46.160> when<00:00:46.309> that<00:00:46.429> wasn't<00:00:46.730> working<00:00:46.850> you

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:47.090 
other one when that wasn't working you

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:49.000 
other one when that wasn't working you
couldn't<00:00:47.329> get<00:00:47.420> the<00:00:47.539> key<00:00:47.690> out<00:00:47.719> so<00:00:48.469> this<00:00:48.620> one<00:00:48.859> is

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:49.010 
couldn't get the key out so this one is

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:50.979 
couldn't get the key out so this one is
the<00:00:49.129> opposite<00:00:49.579> you<00:00:50.149> literally<00:00:50.449> just<00:00:50.750> can't

00:00:50.979 --> 00:00:50.989 
the opposite you literally just can't

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:54.189 
the opposite you literally just can't
get<00:00:51.140> it<00:00:51.260> out<00:00:51.469> of<00:00:51.739> park<00:00:52.449> well<00:00:53.449> it's<00:00:53.809> as<00:00:53.960> simple

00:00:54.189 --> 00:00:54.199 
get it out of park well it's as simple

00:00:54.199 --> 00:00:58.000 
get it out of park well it's as simple
as<00:00:54.620> did<00:00:55.550> you<00:00:55.670> check<00:00:55.940> your<00:00:56.120> fuse<00:00:56.390> if<00:00:56.800> the<00:00:57.800> brake

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:58.010 
as did you check your fuse if the brake

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:00.040 
as did you check your fuse if the brake
light<00:00:58.219> fuse<00:00:58.550> is<00:00:58.760> not<00:00:58.910> working<00:00:59.390> on<00:00:59.539> these<00:00:59.719> it

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:00.050 
light fuse is not working on these it

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:02.020 
light fuse is not working on these it
will<00:01:00.379> not<00:01:00.589> know<00:01:00.890> that<00:01:01.339> your<00:01:01.579> foot<00:01:01.760> is<00:01:01.789> on<00:01:01.999> the

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:02.030 
will not know that your foot is on the

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:05.950 
will not know that your foot is on the
brake<00:01:02.149> to<00:01:02.960> release<00:01:03.320> the<00:01:04.309> actual<00:01:04.960> shifter

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:05.960 
brake to release the actual shifter

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:07.600 
brake to release the actual shifter
right<00:01:06.079> here<00:01:06.259> and<00:01:06.439> so<00:01:07.220> it's<00:01:07.340> when<00:01:07.460> there's

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:07.610 
right here and so it's when there's

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:09.670 
right here and so it's when there's
simple<00:01:07.939> and<00:01:08.060> easy<00:01:08.270> fixes<00:01:08.750> that<00:01:09.079> can<00:01:09.320> save<00:01:09.590> you

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:09.680

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:11.720 
a lot of hassle just by checking your

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:14.319 
a lot of hassle just by checking your
fuse<00:01:12.159> this<00:01:13.159> actually<00:01:13.610> works<00:01:13.790> off<00:01:13.970> your<00:01:14.000> brake

00:01:14.319 --> 00:01:14.329 
fuse this actually works off your brake

00:01:14.329 --> 00:01:16.330 
fuse this actually works off your brake
lights<00:01:14.570> so<00:01:15.259> let's<00:01:15.799> go<00:01:15.920> ahead<00:01:15.979> and<00:01:16.130> change<00:01:16.280> that

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:16.340 
lights so let's go ahead and change that

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:19.060 
lights so let's go ahead and change that
out<00:01:16.640> and<00:01:16.820> see<00:01:17.479> if<00:01:17.570> it<00:01:17.659> fixes<00:01:17.930> it<00:01:18.110> so<00:01:18.920> if<00:01:18.979> you

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:19.070 
out and see if it fixes it so if you

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:20.530 
out and see if it fixes it so if you
have<00:01:19.100> a<00:01:19.220> faulty<00:01:19.579> brake<00:01:19.790> light<00:01:20.000> switch<00:01:20.299> it's

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:20.540 
have a faulty brake light switch it's

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:22.149 
have a faulty brake light switch it's
also<00:01:20.810> one<00:01:21.079> of<00:01:21.110> the<00:01:21.200> other<00:01:21.320> things<00:01:21.619> besides<00:01:22.040> the

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:22.159 
also one of the other things besides the

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:23.920 
also one of the other things besides the
fuse<00:01:22.490> so<00:01:22.640> if<00:01:22.729> the<00:01:22.850> fuse<00:01:23.060> is<00:01:23.210> good<00:01:23.390> you<00:01:23.899> can

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:23.930 
fuse so if the fuse is good you can

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:25.330 
fuse so if the fuse is good you can
check<00:01:24.259> your<00:01:24.380> brake<00:01:24.560> light<00:01:24.740> switch

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:25.340

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:27.219 
check your brake light switch
and<00:01:25.759> if<00:01:26.210> the<00:01:26.360> brake<00:01:26.540> light<00:01:26.720> switch<00:01:26.750> is<00:01:27.079> not

00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:27.229 
and if the brake light switch is not

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:28.719 
and if the brake light switch is not
working<00:01:27.649> and<00:01:27.829> won't<00:01:27.979> let<00:01:28.100> you<00:01:28.220> take<00:01:28.369> the<00:01:28.549> car

the<00:01:37.759> road<00:01:37.850> now<00:01:38.780> one<00:01:39.229> of<00:01:39.320> the<00:01:39.380> things<00:01:39.530> I

00:01:39.639 --> 00:01:39.649 
the road now one of the things I

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:41.859 
the road now one of the things I
realized<00:01:40.040> was<00:01:40.490> I<00:01:40.729> went<00:01:40.909> to<00:01:40.969> go<00:01:41.060> test<00:01:41.329> the<00:01:41.479> fuse

00:01:41.859 --> 00:01:41.869 
realized was I went to go test the fuse

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:43.690 
realized was I went to go test the fuse
there<00:01:42.229> was<00:01:42.350> no<00:01:42.530> fuse<00:01:42.890> in<00:01:43.130> the<00:01:43.340> brake<00:01:43.490> light

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:43.700 
there was no fuse in the brake light

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:45.999 
there was no fuse in the brake light
switch<00:01:43.729> areas<00:01:44.450> so<00:01:44.869> that<00:01:44.899> automatically<00:01:45.680> told

00:01:45.999 --> 00:01:46.009 
switch areas so that automatically told

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:48.100 
switch areas so that automatically told
me<00:01:46.130> it<00:01:46.789> was<00:01:47.030> probably<00:01:47.390> a<00:01:47.479> bad<00:01:47.630> brake<00:01:47.899> light

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:48.110 
me it was probably a bad brake light

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:49.959 
me it was probably a bad brake light
switch<00:01:48.409> so<00:01:48.680> now<00:01:49.250> we<00:01:49.310> can<00:01:49.549> go<00:01:49.610> ahead<00:01:49.670> and<00:01:49.850> turn

00:01:49.959 --> 00:01:49.969 
switch so now we can go ahead and turn

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:54.760 
switch so now we can go ahead and turn
the<00:01:50.090> key<00:01:50.270> to<00:01:50.299> on<00:01:50.630> and<00:01:53.439> let's<00:01:54.439> just<00:01:54.619> we're

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:54.770 
the key to on and let's just we're

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:56.170 
the key to on and let's just we're
putting<00:01:55.009> the<00:01:55.070> fuse<00:01:55.280> back<00:01:55.490> on<00:01:55.759> it<00:01:55.880> so<00:01:56.030> now<00:01:56.149> we

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:56.180 
putting the fuse back on it so now we

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:57.639 
putting the fuse back on it so now we
got<00:01:56.450> a<00:01:56.479> new<00:01:56.719> switch<00:01:57.020> we're<00:01:57.200> going<00:01:57.320> to<00:01:57.409> go<00:01:57.530> and

00:01:57.639 --> 00:01:57.649 
got a new switch we're going to go and

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:59.590 
got a new switch we're going to go and
put<00:01:57.740> the<00:01:57.859> new<00:01:57.979> switch<00:01:58.219> on<00:01:58.430> and<00:01:58.700> get<00:01:59.450> this

00:01:59.590 --> 00:01:59.600 
put the new switch on and get this

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:01.929 
put the new switch on and get this
wrapped<00:01:59.810> up<00:01:59.990> so<00:02:00.229> more<00:02:00.560> than<00:02:00.649> likely<00:02:00.829> can't<00:02:01.789> get

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:01.939 
wrapped up so more than likely can't get

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:03.700 
wrapped up so more than likely can't get
your<00:02:02.090> car<00:02:02.299> out<00:02:02.329> of<00:02:02.570> park<00:02:02.810> you're<00:02:03.439> having<00:02:03.649> a

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:03.710 
your car out of park you're having a

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:05.679 
your car out of park you're having a
break<00:02:03.890> I<00:02:04.039> case<00:02:04.280> you<00:02:04.490> either<00:02:04.700> blown<00:02:05.060> fuse<00:02:05.420> or

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:05.689 
break I case you either blown fuse or

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:07.539 
break I case you either blown fuse or
bad<00:02:05.869> switch<00:02:06.200> get<00:02:06.740> this<00:02:06.859> all<00:02:06.979> change<00:02:07.219> out<00:02:07.430> and

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:07.549 
bad switch get this all change out and

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:09.309 
bad switch get this all change out and
get<00:02:07.640> it<00:02:07.729> back<00:02:07.789> on<00:02:07.969> again<00:02:08.030> while<00:02:08.899> knowing

00:02:09.309 --> 00:02:09.319 
get it back on again while knowing

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:10.690 
get it back on again while knowing
pretty<00:02:09.530> much<00:02:09.709> see<00:02:09.920> exactly<00:02:10.429> what<00:02:10.580> had

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:10.700 
pretty much see exactly what had

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:11.710 
pretty much see exactly what had
happened

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:11.720 
happened

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:15.190 
happened
it<00:02:12.650> actually<00:02:13.280> had<00:02:13.550> gotten<00:02:13.850> so<00:02:14.180> hot<00:02:14.420> it<00:02:14.750> melted

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.200 
it actually had gotten so hot it melted

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.250 
it actually had gotten so hot it melted
itself<00:02:15.620> to<00:02:15.920> the<00:02:16.190> actual<00:02:16.700> harness<00:02:17.240> so<00:02:18.050> I<00:02:18.080> had<00:02:18.170> to

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:18.260 
itself to the actual harness so I had to

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.140 
itself to the actual harness so I had to
literally<00:02:18.500> cut<00:02:18.800> it<00:02:18.950> out<00:02:19.100> and<00:02:19.370> pry<00:02:19.670> it<00:02:19.700> out<00:02:19.910> to

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:20.150 
literally cut it out and pry it out to

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:22.030 
literally cut it out and pry it out to
little<00:02:20.390> piece<00:02:20.570> there<00:02:20.810> it's<00:02:21.410> actually<00:02:21.650> still

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040 
little piece there it's actually still

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:25.660 
little piece there it's actually still
pretty<00:02:22.100> much<00:02:22.400> usable<00:02:24.310> actually<00:02:25.310> goes<00:02:25.460> in<00:02:25.610> a

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670 
pretty much usable actually goes in a

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:27.160 
pretty much usable actually goes in a
pretty<00:02:25.880> decent<00:02:26.180> I'm<00:02:26.450> about<00:02:26.540> to<00:02:26.660> clean<00:02:26.840> it<00:02:26.990> up<00:02:27.050> a

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170 
pretty decent I'm about to clean it up a

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:28.390 
pretty decent I'm about to clean it up a
little<00:02:27.230> bit<00:02:27.440> to<00:02:27.560> get<00:02:27.680> in<00:02:27.860> there<00:02:28.040> so<00:02:28.250> we're

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 
little bit to get in there so we're

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:29.710 
little bit to get in there so we're
going<00:02:28.490> to<00:02:28.550> replace<00:02:28.910> it<00:02:29.000> with<00:02:29.240> a<00:02:29.360> brand<00:02:29.660> new

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:29.720 
going to replace it with a brand new

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:32.560 
going to replace it with a brand new

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:32.570 
switch right here and get this car back

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:34.330 
switch right here and get this car back
up<00:02:32.780> and<00:02:32.930> going<00:02:33.050> all<00:02:33.740> right<00:02:33.860> now<00:02:34.040> the<00:02:34.100> brake

switch has been replaced let's see we
got<00:02:36.370> kion

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:37.550 
got kion

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:40.950

put<00:02:37.880> on<00:02:38.000> the<00:02:38.060> brake<00:02:38.210> pedal<00:02:38.420> as<00:02:39.080> you<00:02:39.260> see<00:02:39.500> and

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:40.960 
put on the brake pedal as you see and

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:42.330 
put on the brake pedal as you see and
wha-la

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:42.340 
wha-la

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:45.130 
wha-la
fixed<00:02:43.340> so<00:02:43.940> we<00:02:44.060> had<00:02:44.150> a<00:02:44.180> bad<00:02:44.360> brake<00:02:44.660> light<00:02:44.840> switch

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:45.140 
fixed so we had a bad brake light switch

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:47.680 
fixed so we had a bad brake light switch
and<00:02:45.680> actually<00:02:46.370> popped<00:02:46.610> a<00:02:46.760> fuse<00:02:47.060> so<00:02:47.090> it<00:02:47.480> caused

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:47.690 
and actually popped a fuse so it caused

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:49.030 
and actually popped a fuse so it caused
all<00:02:47.870> sorts<00:02:48.170> of<00:02:48.200> little<00:02:48.290> problems<00:02:48.560> in<00:02:48.830> there
