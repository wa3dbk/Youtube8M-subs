00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:13.540
 You can see here that the doors 

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:15.340
 windows are really wood and the 

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:17.590
 doors are like stone windows in 

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:19.330
 reality if you break it today is the map 

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:23.310
 your goal but you can still change 

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:23.310
 survival mode with 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.510
 because tulle or some other tool 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.960
 for minecraft you can see that the 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:32.599
 doors are like 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:34.309
 Well, I do not know what they are like, 

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:36.469
 stone there are doors that are really 

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:39.019
 as you can see here and this is the room 

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:42.079
 of dj that are the furniture and here is 

00:00:39.019 --> 00:00:45.260
 the door to nothing 

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:47.750
 I 'm supposed to be in another room and 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:50.300
 you can see here is something and I 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:53.600
 it's ok to see here that the kitchen is 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:56.980
 from dj let's see 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:01:00.670
 we have here what is the kitchen of dj 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:03.879
 and above we have what it is 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:05.619
 the room and the closet said and but as 

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:07.810
 You can see here the doors in 

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:09.700
 they do not lead to anything or to you 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:13.330
 when they download the map they can 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:15.310
 you transform it to your liking 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:18.190
 and well that doors are not me either 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:19.540
 like nothing else is by encimita inside 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:22.510
 of the torch if everything goes out you like it 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:26.830
 you can if you want to download the map 

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:28.120
 and already remodeled his taste to talk going 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:31.510
 of the house say already and things are 

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:34.690
 your neighbors the house of the rider the house of 

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:36.040
 smoke and good can see here that they are 

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:37.600
 the other houses in the neighborhood that all 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:39.010
 They have their rare stone gates the 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:40.510
 garages 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:43.750
 and we are going to go up a bit more so that 

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:45.010
 see some good scenery all 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:48.660
 you can see here is the house of this 

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:48.660
 neighbor to create that planted 

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:53.240
 he planted marijuana here in the yard yes 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:55.880
 bad I do not remember he has many but I played 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:59.900
 the best game I've played in gta 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:03.290
 true and good we have here the map 

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:05.960
 the map of the bridge that is part of the 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:07.610
 main map but obviously in the 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:10.900
 main magician this bridge takes you 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:14.000
 towards the highway and obviously 

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:16.100
 as here does not reach the world because it 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.630
 they had nothing else in this part in the 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:19.870
 original game follow highway until 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:23.240
 there you can see that there are those stairs 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:25.490
 where there is another bridge where you have to 

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:27.580
 do graffiti missions under those 

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:30.140
 Graffiti bridges in the original game 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:31.819
 you converted the whole neighborhood of groups 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:34.250
 street 

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:36.080
 and good 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:37.970
 part of this area is also where 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:40.130
 they were invaded by bullets that are 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:43.010
 the delayed 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:45.470
 As you can see here, nothing else is what 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:47.230
 which is the main highway and the 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:50.830
 chair colony 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:53.560
 obviously for reasons of space and 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:56.440
 that is the editing touch the creators 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:57.940
 nothing created up here then there are 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:00.599
 a computer version that is 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:03.159
 the whole city ​​for built but and 

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:05.019
 like the pocket edition the maps are 

00:03:03.159 --> 00:03:08.349
 limited at the moment because nothing else 

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:11.319
 they did here what can 

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:13.959
 support a phone or tablet but in the 

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:15.480
 future and what is it listen to the 

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:17.620
 updates are going to make the maps already 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:20.290
 infinities like the computer then 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:23.110
 in the not too distant future we can already 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:27.350
 have the full version and good because 

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:29.390
 they want more houses in themselves is not much he 

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:30.980
 the only variety is the chair colony 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:33.350
 and but I still find it very interesting 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:36.170
 because good to those who like it very much 

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:38.800
 that game can revive memories and 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:40.450
 that's not a very good game 

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:42.520
 and good and anyone these houses 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:44.350
 you can inhabit like the must the 

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:47.020
 chair and they have torches beds and some 

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:48.880
 things inside and well that will be all for 

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:50.830
