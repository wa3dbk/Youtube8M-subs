00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:21.019

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:26.090
 for the users of windows 7 we have 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:27.470
 made their own video because of the 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:29.690
 history regarding the assignment of rights 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:32.480
 we will see it soon under windows 8 

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:34.820
 starting to represent something else too 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:37.070

 regedit exe Enter 

00:00:40.909 --> 00:00:47.840
 I'll click ok this will be 

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:49.880
 confirmed and then we search 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:51.680
 after a very particular class about 

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:54.710
 edit and then search or 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:55.610
 control f glass id you will find in 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:58.760
 the description 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:59.690
 click on looking after the 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:03.920
 was found 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:06.880
 click below also from this shell 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:09.500
 folder we select right mouse button 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:13.130
 Select permissions in the context menu 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:15.480
 then we click on expanded 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:17.850
 Here we first see that the owner 

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:19.710
 this key is still the user system 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.980
 is we have to change this click 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:26.040
 We change here and give here 

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:27.750
 administrators a name after that 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.310
 check that will be found afterwards 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.410
 this is underlined 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.150
 then we can click ok now 

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:34.530
 was changed accordingly and 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.450
 Now we have the possibility of 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.300
 group of administrators currently 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:42.210
 can only read 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:44.130
 with a double click the full handle too 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:46.560
 but do not miss it here 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.630
 because under windows 8 these were right 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.050
 we still have to pass on that 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:53.450
 abolish by inheritance here 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:55.290

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:00.600

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.229

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:08.640

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:12.690

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:16.670

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:16.670
