00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:05.980
 attention this bone has happened that we have today sara forester 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:10.319
 and michel le clermontois pierced will welcome them 

00:00:10.319 --> 00:00:15.399
 it will be a question of modern demos anyway even of the contemporary month he 

00:00:15.399 --> 00:00:16.860
 written for some begin 

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:20.630
 as at the beginning of the last century we mention among others the bird flu 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:22.380
 communitarianism 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.560
 the bad faith activists of nuclear that everyone knows since the beginning of the 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.890
 March that it's safe 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:31.880
 misinformation of the media the marshals south of 8 50 of the aftermath 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:34.760
 of the war in Algeria the zeal of some administrations 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:37.960
 wedding in white and all that do not go away 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:39.700
 and all this on a mode 

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:44.020
 happy and hopeful - as a provider 

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:47.410
 17 hours 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:48.800
 the comedy 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.940
 so already detailed and 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:54.330
 I think I'm not so good at 

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:56.360
 to do something other than comedy 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:00.390
 but for the course between I like that in a small number to account 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:01.560
 Something 

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:03.490
 or at least we're talking 

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:06.630
 of kiaka a point of view on something 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.940
 quick of the world what we live in 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:13.650
 so here it is done the combination of their life always to make a 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:14.380
 comedy 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:16.460
 but at the same time to be afraid 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:19.460
 from one point of view and try to talk about the particular ump 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:21.020
 of the time 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.950
 and studies 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:23.130
 the goal of france 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:24.280
 present-day 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:27.770
 skiff and here we come to sign like that he has 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:28.660
 at the fair 

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:29.780
 this shape 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:32.980
 and at the same time who knows 

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:36.880
 dede to put their finger on them which eventually can hurt 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.469
 in europe for jean-guy how I feel like we're shooting 

00:01:40.469 --> 00:01:42.220
 we do not 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:45.620
 in a racket makes me very obsessive about a number of 

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:49.900
 % topics like identity as if the 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:53.730
 the risk that it happens when we wanted to talk about his obsessions 

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:57.160
 the army through the commission mode is ready to follow this 

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:59.560
 case certainly it took me years to find more topics 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:01.630
 serious voting 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:04.999
 which strikes hard I am very happy to participate 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.010
 suspense 10h38 

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:10.549
 work in which branch 

00:02:10.549 --> 00:02:13.389
 actually what I did not really think 

00:02:13.389 --> 00:02:15.919
 but if it is not true 

00:02:15.919 --> 00:02:17.329
 I was very good 

00:02:17.329 --> 00:02:20.329
 we all know that difficult 

00:02:20.979 --> 00:02:23.979
 you know it was really exciting 

00:02:26.899 --> 00:02:29.859
 not so simple in France 

00:02:29.859 --> 00:02:31.279
 no politics 

00:02:31.279 --> 00:02:32.990
 but the constancy 

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:36.150
 for 100 m of everyday life ie that already 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:40.159
 for 100 euros the two main characters of such policies 

00:02:40.829 --> 00:02:45.129
 for his perfumes at all a film so cynical that describes politics as 

00:02:45.129 --> 00:02:46.700
 all rotten federal 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:49.699
 I'm doing a movie that's where I'm not doing a job I'm not doing 

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:51.050
 a political speech 

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:53.139
 and I want to say 

00:02:53.139 --> 00:02:57.069
 to address to a contribution what a viewer a bit matters who vote and 

00:02:57.069 --> 00:02:59.620
 no matter who thinks that for me it was important 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:02.810
 what make a movie is clear that the world is not so said paulette 

00:03:03.409 --> 00:03:05.830
 than what bahia thinks in the movie 

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:09.100
 and he's very often in the projections of people doing good at 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:10.660
 moral warns you right now 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:13.169
 I vote right but I got the hang of it anyway 

00:03:13.169 --> 00:03:16.159
 because with a little bit of self-mockery but I think everything 

00:03:16.159 --> 00:03:17.579
 the world 

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:20.709
 in this context this way 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:22.699
 Nicolas Sarkozy 

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:24.709
 this season 

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:27.719
 facing certain decisions in these tournaments that's why you can 

00:03:27.719 --> 00:03:30.739
 because for him this season 35 and fiber optics in France 

00:03:31.649 --> 00:03:34.649
 in front of the goal sarkozy 

00:03:39.189 --> 00:03:40.280
 to see her 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:41.709
 finally the last 

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:44.609
 that's how we are a little kick in the ass to get out a little 

00:03:44.609 --> 00:03:45.529
 yourself 

00:03:45.529 --> 00:03:47.059
 roads like that 

00:03:47.059 --> 00:03:49.249
 looking forward to being extroverted 

00:03:49.249 --> 00:03:50.349
 and M 

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:52.669
 it is something that is very pleasant and 

00:03:52.669 --> 00:03:55.849
 and when we are lucky enough to have a character like that we will row 

00:03:55.849 --> 00:03:58.139
 he is not depressed during this period 

00:03:58.139 --> 00:04:00.999
 me when I made this character kids of all the shooting it was 

00:04:00.999 --> 00:04:01.929
 she 

00:04:01.929 --> 00:04:06.209
 and I tasted diversity I was really in a state in 

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:09.199
 start of specific mission during the whole shooting period it was 

00:04:09.199 --> 00:04:10.510
 really very enjoyable 

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:12.039
 for this purpose 

00:04:12.039 --> 00:04:14.289
 then that's who pulls 

00:04:14.289 --> 00:04:18.299
 so much money that she for the purpose of this idea and it's part of 

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:21.389
 two skeletons and she and it's not trifecta sainz 

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:24.389
 6 l a character 

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:27.680
 in this one he so decided five years ago making it 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:30.319
 it embarks otherwise works well 

00:04:30.319 --> 00:04:32.639
 and in the future I think someone who says 

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:36.300
 so not thinking about his body I think it gives me even more desire to 

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:40.500
 fix to watch while someone who is not embarrassed at all he's us 

00:04:40.499 --> 00:04:43.460
 take between Paris and finally it plays a lot of people 

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:47.290
 it's certainly the cinema if something happens that emerges and if its 

00:04:47.289 --> 00:04:51.360
 head was then that people case first of all we knew we wanted that 

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:54.189
 the character of bella swan verdun idealistic 

00:04:54.189 --> 00:04:58.150
 that is to say someone who really thinks to change the world 

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:02.460
 and somewhere that looks like a character from the 70's 

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:04.159
 % 

00:05:04.159 --> 00:05:06.319
 diving in the years 2010 

00:05:06.319 --> 00:05:10.050
 and so that was really the idea the idea of ​​the character of bahia and so 

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:13.250
 advised to have left in the 70s that gold 

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:18.500
 we could very well to mix the politics the one that we could 

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:20.220
 compensate again recently 

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:23.120
 to change the world with its ideals 

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:27.320
 and so by filling this reasoning sediba sees the scene this character has 

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:28.870
 to sleep with his enemies 

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:30.360
 she makes love not war 

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:33.720
 and being we took the law to the expression foot of the letter 

00:05:33.719 --> 00:05:38.800
 obviously this last sum of comedy finally almost but will have to 

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:39.300
 beware 

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:40.930
 this match 

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:43.680
 wearing a signature suit thursday at reuters nick cannon 

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:44.710
 it does not go through 

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:47.860
 why this year for example when I met was the responsible 

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:50.860
 very important sex finance 

00:05:51.379 --> 00:05:53.389
 if nothing is done in France 

00:05:53.389 --> 00:05:55.699
 it is important to me 

00:05:55.699 --> 00:05:58.699
 it's first serving 

00:06:00.889 --> 00:06:02.039
 Why 

00:06:02.039 --> 00:06:03.659
 it would be 

00:06:03.659 --> 00:06:06.659
 ma said m 

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:11.770
 I will have to give everything to the poor 

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:15.639
 the village is actually very cite like that looks good 

00:06:15.639 --> 00:06:19.710
 go in all directions in the era of 2 pass from one subject to another 

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:21.860
 from one mood to another 

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:23.749
 but what makes deep unity 

00:06:23.749 --> 00:06:26.850
 one of the jdd that may be that people never get lost 

00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:29.130
 these are the characters she sits for 

00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:30.569
 jacques gamblin for that 

00:06:30.569 --> 00:06:33.510
 we are with them we love them so from there 

00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:36.360
 while we are ready to follow them in any 

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:37.230
 situation 

00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:40.259
 yahoo title 

00:06:40.259 --> 00:06:41.699
 no 

00:06:41.699 --> 00:06:43.289
 what are you doing here 

00:06:43.289 --> 00:06:48.080
 the viewer's gaze it's often come from the point of view of for the time being 

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:48.900
 in the movie 

00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:51.139
 and a lot has happened in 

00:06:51.139 --> 00:06:56.289
 still very little is actually happening 

00:06:56.289 --> 00:06:59.360
 the film was based on milk 

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:03.580
 their relationship between two hurdles as a clown report 

00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:06.499
 and it was really important that the balance effect 

00:07:06.499 --> 00:07:08.090
 thanks to you more 

00:07:08.090 --> 00:07:12.880
