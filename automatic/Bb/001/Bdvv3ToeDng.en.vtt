00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:06.540
 hi everyone today we have a fishing 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:11.179
 box 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:16.680
 do it yourself homemade rubric 

00:00:11.179 --> 00:00:21.170
 it means me with 2 sex consists 1 means 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:25.710
 here is here sidushkoy space for 

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:26.760
 fishing rods there feeders do not know there here 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.340
 there will be partitions 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:34.730
 but this is everyone at their own discretion 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:38.309
 it makes someone like you mean 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:46.789
 I have fasteners here with a diplomat 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:49.350
 made here such are closed and all 

00:00:46.789 --> 00:00:55.050
 the second section respectively 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:01:00.320
 the main box is made of two 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:04.019
 chambers from under the refrigerator first chamber 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:11.010
 the whole back wall which was already 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:15.720
 the second was freezer 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:21.200
 there was less than good aluminum apt 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:24.990
 it bends very well in short 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:28.500
 then the material is made of 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:34.790
 facing everything he is like everything is no longer 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:39.180
 opens closed all done found 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:44.220
 a heater itself such that's the plan here 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:47.750
 so this thickness does not know millimeter 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:52.290
 two and a half can under 3 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:58.530
 glue and glue side 1 she has 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:02:01.439
 Got this on the tank itself means 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:05.369
 itâ€™s all about all the way to 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:10.640
 top and, accordingly, the seat itself too 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:15.390
 four layers with three layers was 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:17.520
 insulated ass a little winter like this 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:21.260
 here and overlays 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:29.660
 the width he has somewhere right now I will say for sure 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:32.989
 width is about to see everything and centimeter 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:32.989
 recruited later 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:42.380
 wrapped his scotch sanitary 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:47.040
 such a layer, that is, all costs 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:52.620
 respectively, just missed and all as 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:55.560
 I would not handle the handle yet 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:58.350
 did not do it because it is well to each his own 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:02.850
 will be there that cards like you here 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:05.520
 the back side here is all it is closed if 

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:10.020
 even somewhere you got hurt then 

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:11.580
 process broke something again without 

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:12.860
 problems on tape the whole thing 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:15.750
 closes and 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:19.620
 principle he continue to go on here 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:23.630
 we press and basically everything is as you 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:26.940
 see shut down nothing dangles 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:27.560
 the appearance of these places to catch on 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:30.570
 there 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:31.820
 some clasps mounted there but me 

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:34.590
 I didn't like this idea 

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:40.430
 so I kind of did this 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:40.430
 how to give dimensions let's see it 

00:03:44.630 --> 00:04:00.150
 its height means its height is 42 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:04:06.980
 centimeter wider by 43 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:15.390
 roughly 44 let it be insulation means 

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:19.229
 we got the main section 33 

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:22.889
 roughly speaking generally sidushkoy means u 

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:28.500
 we got 9 and a small tank for fishing rods 

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:31.070
 8 centimeters who wish to make 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:34.650
 do-it-yourself tank and principle 

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:39.630
 what I want to say to pay for the flank from 

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:41.880
 I have no particular desire only 

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:44.490
 maybe a problem someone will find 

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:47.160
 there from the old fridge this camera 

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:49.590
 freezer before the principle somewhere can on 

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:52.199
 charmed and what sort of reception points 

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:57.389
 procurement I think you can 

00:04:52.199 --> 00:05:00.630
 it's easy to find so especially you 

00:04:57.389 --> 00:05:05.760
 probably labor will not make up well that's all in 

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:08.370
 principle what could be said about the boxes 

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:12.120
 the dimensions I gave the materials of what is done 

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:16.620
 was told and the cover means itself 

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:21.360
 our cover is made of material 

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:24.500
 This is called Al Kabun . 

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:24.500
 two sides aluminum 

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:32.820
 mean in the middle of plastic and now i'm 

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:35.599
 show you will mean polika won 

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:35.599
 you see 

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:42.680
 to tell 

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:50.060
 well you can see yes that one side glistens 

00:05:47.389 --> 00:05:56.150
 and glitters 2 sides 

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:56.630
 and in the middle there is plastic patreon 

00:05:56.150 --> 00:06:05.780
 new clothes 

00:05:56.630 --> 00:06:08.620
 so he made a cover of it . and 

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:14.530
 at the same time it is accordingly very 

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:17.380
 hard as it's hard but that is 

00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:20.710
 and you can jump on this suitcase 

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:20.710
 thanks to all
