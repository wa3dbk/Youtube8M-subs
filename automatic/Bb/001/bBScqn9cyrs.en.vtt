 mayors mayors with the 12 mayors who 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.029

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.770

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:51.690
 and when it's a holiday on Monday until 2 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.160
 in the morning because because when 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.170
 presented the different schedule in 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.810
 different in the municipalities for example 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:00.260
 Armenian 3 in the morning and in another 

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:02.730
 municipality 2 in the morning as they 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:04.710
 migrate from one place to another to 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.780
 follow the rumba and that's where it 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.210
 presented, for example, accidents 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.610
 on public roads and presented 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.619
 soon personal injuries 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:16.619
 before this we can say that with the 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:19.880
 As a measure of the schedule, the 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:21.740
 personal injuries in the department 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:23.750
 if we can do a control of 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:25.340
 public establishments but 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:27.590
 I can also determine that in this 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:29.990
 Control of public establishments 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:32.810
 has found that there are some sites 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:35.090
 clandestine who once leave at 2 o'clock 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:38.810
 in the morning of the rumba promote 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:41.119
 these cards with the 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:44.569
 promote by voice telephone 

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:47.479
 cellular and do the meetings by 

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:49.240
 example in some establishments or ones 

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:53.349
 places that are coming to circasia 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:55.880
 there have we have achieved 

00:01:53.349 --> 00:01:57.439
 immobilize vehicles or people who 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:00.820
 drive in a state of struggle is once 

00:01:57.439 --> 00:02:02.850
 come out and that these sites 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:05.470
 of an effective control of the police 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:07.600
 to prevent them from continuing to work in 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:10.360
 clandestine way is what we 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:12.410
 we can have here in the department in 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:14.990
 relation to clubs 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:18.170
 is determined as a club that must 

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:20.540
 have a necessary regulation that 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:22.730
 I settled as club starting with that 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:25.310
 as a club you should have swimming pools 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:28.520
 soccer tennis courts all that 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:32.450
 concerns sport to the recreation of 

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:35.420
 those of which are affiliated as a club 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:38.740
 there must be a congregation of people 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:42.800
 who are and are part of the club and 

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:45.350
 effectively a ten-meter site 

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:49.420
 by four meters where one works 

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:49.420
 club can not be a club
