 playstation 4 awaited anus and xbox 720 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:06.029
 as well as a trend to merge week

 console and computer games 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:08.970
 that is, about what they will play more or less 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:10.500
 it is clear and here is how it will play 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:11.820
 can cool change the next six months 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.049
 already in the mother of the developers will get 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.190
 sighting device samples under 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:15.809
 name oculus rift 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.980
 This is the world's first virtual glasses not 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:18.090
 supplemented namely virtual 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.650
 realities that can become 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.880
 really bulk goods then not 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.230
 will give and appearing not injured to parade 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.699
 and it was not perceived seriously 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.590
 Olive more than successfully delegated 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.210
 exhibition cebit 2013 on quality and 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.590
 visitors details and breeders not 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.720
 hide emotions for the first time immersed in 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.800
 virtual reality 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:33.120
 The first type of elevator was introduced yet 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.680
 this conference and 3 last year 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.010
 and none other than John showed it 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.210
 karmak 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.500
 founder of agni software and one of 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.010
 most reputable and breeders and 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.360
 I head 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.800
 he will demonstrate that then 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.790
 resembled a ski mask that used to 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.469
 scotch anyone to from mobile phone 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.550
 feed for this that the next house will be 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:46.710
 support the operation of such a device 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.030
 and the promise kept the developers braslava 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.710
 they gave him a box to collect money for 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.390
 further work on kickstarter weight 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.680
 performed at 150 thousand dollars in just 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.300
 two days price two and a half 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.739
 million it was in august it later 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.239
 half a year they send ready samples 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.649
 technical about plums is a game on 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:00.090
 channel less than six inches transmitting 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.649
 medium image is equipped with two faces 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.969
 which software they create 3d ether 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:04.229
 somehow takes all the use 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.820
 user cable will change for the eyes 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:07.020
 real world images while 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.340
 player change the viewing angle absolutely 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.689
 natural movement of the head can 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.369
 turn around look under your feet 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:12.930
 there is a head on his shoulder bert van der 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.979
 fully adaptable to a Greek 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.540
 human visual perception 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.860
 information and how presence is so much 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.229
 strongly that visitors to stand around sleep 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.880
 Russia 2013 even flirt at will 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.930
 snowflakes falling virtual world when 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.189
 This is the rest of the movement to use 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.479
 do ordinary joystick if 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.770
 system to control another flight 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.630
 character hands machine can be cut 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.950
 eye and mouth respectively untie 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.390
 i.e. weapon can take hold 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.619
 heads and can be a separate joystick when 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.420
 this head controls only the look 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.560
 character, if possible, the mass and not 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.880
 only and not so much for shooting to 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.619
 main consumer grivka are considered for 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.640
 barrels will be customers mpr baguette 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:40.710
 fighter dive headlong 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.909
 magically I will remind the way that now everything 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.320
 largest manufacturers of gaming systems 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.490
 work on his own fault cast 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.659
 and joysticks risk developers 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.860
 showing off his brainchild with the usual 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.210
 controller contrive happens 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.619
 totally student player hands and 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.970
 lift here is a new feature however 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:52.110
 here on properties not only this case 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.310
 commercial success she is capable 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.479
 completely change the rules of the hardware 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.560
 racing is now gaming makers 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:57.030
 video cards do more and more 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.320
 powerful and accordingly expensive models 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.700
 able to give out as clearly as possible 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.290
 picture as wide as possible 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.369
 screen will make it is not necessary 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.899
 actually enough to make a video 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:05.220
 the map here is the screen of the smartphone it is quite 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:06.480
 pulls a picture gives a 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:07.920
 means the console is a future bunch sit 

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:09.300
 will cost less on this background 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.950
 prospects ends budget modular 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.660
 systems against she represented inscribed 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.530
 however, the risk itself is not cheap now 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:17.150
 I'm among the developers 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.150
 Deliveries in April served at 300 was
