and<00:00:35.410> you're<00:00:36.410> just<00:00:36.559> gonna<00:00:36.739> roughly<00:00:37.040> sketch<00:00:37.460> out

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:37.670 
and you're just gonna roughly sketch out

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:39.939 
and you're just gonna roughly sketch out
a<00:00:37.699> guideline<00:00:38.030> for<00:00:38.660> the<00:00:38.720> wave<00:00:38.960> make<00:00:39.590> sure<00:00:39.769> that

00:00:39.939 --> 00:00:39.949 
a guideline for the wave make sure that

00:00:39.949 --> 00:00:41.740 
a guideline for the wave make sure that
every<00:00:40.250> nail<00:00:40.430> is<00:00:40.640> different<00:00:41.090> and<00:00:41.239> unique<00:00:41.360> so

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:41.750 
every nail is different and unique so

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:42.939

recommend Google imaging starfishes just
to<00:01:59.030> kind<00:01:59.270> of<00:01:59.650> get<00:02:00.650> a<00:02:00.680> feel<00:02:00.950> for<00:02:00.979> what<00:02:01.310> they<00:02:01.460> look

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:01.670 
to kind of get a feel for what they look

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:03.640 
to kind of get a feel for what they look
like<00:02:01.909> and<00:02:02.240> find<00:02:02.659> turned<00:02:02.870> out<00:02:03.020> a<00:02:03.049> little<00:02:03.380> bit

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:03.650 
like and find turned out a little bit

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:05.350 
like and find turned out a little bit
sloppy<00:02:03.890> and<00:02:04.370> a<00:02:04.460> little<00:02:04.729> bit<00:02:04.850> bigger<00:02:05.060> than<00:02:05.299> I

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:05.360 
sloppy and a little bit bigger than I

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:07.180 
sloppy and a little bit bigger than I
hoped<00:02:05.630> it<00:02:05.810> would<00:02:05.840> be<00:02:06.140> but<00:02:06.290> it<00:02:06.770> doesn't<00:02:06.799> have<00:02:07.159> to

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:07.190 
hoped it would be but it doesn't have to

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:19.390 
hoped it would be but it doesn't have to
be<00:02:07.340> perfect

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.680 

so<00:02:20.400> now<00:02:20.520> I'm<00:02:20.730> just<00:02:20.819> going<00:02:20.970> to<00:02:21.060> be<00:02:21.180> dipping<00:02:21.540> a

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
so now I'm just going to be dipping a

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:23.449 
so now I'm just going to be dipping a
