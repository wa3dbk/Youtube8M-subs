 you just need to make the decision 

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:33.360
 ask if the following 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:36.450
 in a year not five years from now 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:38.790

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.660
 front of your dreams 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:51.090

 just have to feel the urge to go to the end 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:07.650
 but first you need to jump 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.640
 because what begins to 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.729
 to move 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.320
 continues the process by 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:16.290
 Yes, it's just fire food. 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:18.780
 you can not fall into the trap of fear 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:22.500

 illusions that we of their passion are 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:28.500
 Gift you're with everything and there's nothing left. 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:31.229
 You'll doubt this because what? 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:34.530
 makes someone good at something is the 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:37.560
 dedication hard work and do this with 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:41.369
 direction and methodology then 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:43.560
 anyway you will now be what 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:44.960
 makes someone a professional in some 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.540
 thing 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:50.570
 is the concept of taking that little 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:53.330
 idea that small decision that you 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:55.540
 took and executed there leading to the 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:58.759
 far as his imagination is capable of 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:02:00.820
 dedicating every breath of your body 

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:04.100
 for that cause 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:07.850
 seeing the big picture at the end of the road 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:12.080
 to be absolutely the best and do not 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:15.319
 accommodate for reason is not talent is not 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:19.100
 the skill simply boils down to 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:20.269
 How hungry are you, what's your hunger for? 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:22.489
 the improvement 

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:24.890
 How big is your appetite for 

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:27.470
 success because you are willing to 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:30.260
 do to achieve your dreams 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:33.260
 the professionals are better than they are 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:35.630
 do they do not care for opinions of 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:39.920
 Third parties do not care how far 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:43.010
 There's one that does not take a day off from them. 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:44.959
 100% preparing their way and 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:47.750
 perfect what they do best 

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:50.120
 because everything for the much greater purpose 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:51.769
 than any spark of happiness that 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:54.709
 an immediate bonus can 

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:58.549
 achieve your goals 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:03:02.090
 this is pure thinks the higher the 

00:02:58.549 --> 00:03:05.390
 expectations the higher the goal 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:09.500
 this feeling is then amplified 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:11.490
 is the difference between you and them the 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:14.370
 professionals 

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:16.920
 are those who are desirous of 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:17.610
 knocking on the door of the little exhaust 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:23.250
 athlete 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:27.870
 every single day and let's define exhaustion 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:31.350
 to you exhaustion is that point where it is 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:35.550
 so painful that you can not 

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:37.830
 force that point that hurts 

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:40.710
 so much that you can not even think 

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:44.790
 right is to get to that point where 

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:49.380
 you know you did absolutely everything 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:52.650
 its scope that there is nothing more that 

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:56.520
 you might have seen then what 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:59.240
 difference between them and you what you 

00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:02.550
 What are you doing at this stage of your life? 

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:04.920
 You're asking for more. 

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:08.130
 close to your goals or are you 

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:10.370
 pulling away - you're knocking on doors 

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:14.160
 of exhaustion or is only 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:17.340
 uncomfortable know how to be uncomfortable 

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:19.950
 it's not exhaustion being uncomfortable 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:23.340
 your mind giving up before the body 

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:26.810
 being uncomfortable is giving up when 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:29.160
 should strive for excellence 

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:31.590
 happens when you're going to do something 

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:36.180
 thing that will end up for you 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:38.730
 just to make you better is you 

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:40.950
 own creator of this story and not 

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:43.440
 there is this business called failure 

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:45.300
 You just need to talk to yourself, no. 

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:49.080
 not this time 

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:51.540
 not with me but I'll try again and 

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:53.970
 again and I'm going to look at the 

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:56.550
 failure right in the eye and talk to 

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:58.860
 her that I am willing to do everything and 

00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:00.660
 any effort to reach my 

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:03.600
 goals 

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:05.430
 why this effort will never be a 

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:09.080
 progress 

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:12.120
 everything is resolved to how much you mean 

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:13.760
 How big is your appetite for 

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:16.760
 success 

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:19.280
 you just have to do where the people are 

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:21.950
 dying on earth can die for pure 

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:24.280
 continue your goal continues to 

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:24.280
 direct
