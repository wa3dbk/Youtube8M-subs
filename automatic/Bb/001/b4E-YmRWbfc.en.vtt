00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:34.490 
before you start and you make a beat and

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:36.770 
before you start and you make a beat and
you've<00:01:35.490> got<00:01:35.670> four<00:01:35.939> measures<00:01:36.240> of<00:01:36.270> a<00:01:36.420> drum<00:01:36.630> beat

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
you've got four measures of a drum beat

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.590 
you've got four measures of a drum beat
then<00:01:37.020> so<00:01:37.380> you<00:01:37.470> can<00:01:37.710> go<00:01:38.100> back<00:01:38.280> to<00:01:38.340> your<00:01:39.180> view<00:01:39.479> of

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:54.240 

I<00:01:50.310> think<00:01:51.310> we<00:01:51.400> need<00:01:51.520> a<00:01:51.549> little<00:01:51.700> bass<00:01:53.040> I'll<00:01:54.040> add<00:01:54.220> a

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:54.250 
I think we need a little bass I'll add a

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:56.700 
I think we need a little bass I'll add a
new<00:01:54.310> track<00:01:54.930> I'm<00:01:55.930> going<00:01:56.080> to<00:01:56.200> do<00:01:56.290> based<00:01:56.470> on<00:01:56.590> the

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:56.710 
new track I'm going to do based on the

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:58.100 
new track I'm going to do based on the
keyboard<00:01:57.130> but<00:01:57.280> you<00:01:57.340> can<00:01:57.460> also<00:01:57.549> do<00:01:57.820> bass

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
keyboard but you can also do bass

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:02.580 
keyboard but you can also do bass
playing<00:01:59.490> kind<00:02:00.490> of<00:02:00.549> like<00:02:00.700> a<00:02:00.729> simulated<00:02:01.590> actual

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:02.590 
playing kind of like a simulated actual

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:05.100 
playing kind of like a simulated actual
bass<00:02:02.950> guitar<00:02:03.399> we're<00:02:04.299> going<00:02:04.420> to<00:02:04.479> do<00:02:04.570> a<00:02:04.600> keyboard

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:09.919 
bass guitar we're going to do a keyboard
bass<00:02:06.600> now<00:02:07.600> the<00:02:07.659> keyboard<00:02:07.899> defaults<00:02:08.440> to<00:02:08.619> piano

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:00.300 
different sections so if we click on

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:02.120

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:05.640 
obviously they're rearranged because it

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:08.180
