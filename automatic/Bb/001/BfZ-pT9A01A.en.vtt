00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.900
 Now we make the lights in front of the mirror: 

00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:10.166
 they are two lights attached to the ceiling that will come down and fill this area. 

00:00:10.166 --> 00:00:13.666
 Let's see how to do it. 

00:00:13.666 --> 00:00:18.999
 From the top view I can create rectangles and then shape the objects. 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.100
 But first of all, I'm going to hide what I don't care about, 

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:23.733
 primarily hiding the floor. 

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:30.800
 Note that we have forgotten these two tiles: 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.700
 let's remember in the following phases to group them together with the rest. 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:39.400
 In a nutshell we have to hide everything that is superfluous for our modeling, 

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:41.333
 as we did previously. 

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:48.433
 We thus obtain the cleaned up scene. 

00:00:48.433 --> 00:00:59.699
 Above the mirror I go to create the Chamfer Boxes, 

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:02.300
 with a value of about 6 by 6 cm, 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:08.633
 a height of 1.5 cm or 2 and a connection of 0.25 cm. 

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:14.733
 I place these objects at a certain distance; 

00:01:14.733 --> 00:01:18.433
 I still don't know how much it will be necessary because we will have to see them 

00:01:18.433 --> 00:01:21.366
 from the view of the room and then from the frame. 

00:01:21.366 --> 00:01:24.799
 Let's create a cylinder later, centered on the object. 

00:01:29.566 --> 00:01:34.532
 The diameter must be more or less equal to that of the object previously created. 

00:01:34.533 --> 00:01:41.633
 The radius will be approximately 2.5 cm, resulting in a diameter of 5 cm. 

00:01:41.633 --> 00:01:45.699
 Eventually we can use a 3 cm radius, nobody forbids it 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:49.166
 if we want to do something a little more cumbersome. 

00:01:49.166 --> 00:01:54.499
 Since it is an edge we assign a height of 3 cm. 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:58.366
 We also remove height divisions because we don't need them. 

00:01:58.366 --> 00:02:01.932
 The TurboSmooth modifier will not be used on these objects 

00:02:01.933 --> 00:02:05.399
 and therefore the border can be completely executed by the subdivisions, 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:07.533
 setting a value of 25: 

00:02:07.533 --> 00:02:11.766
 this to give a softer and more rounded effect. 

00:02:11.766 --> 00:02:17.799
 We also create a tube, 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:23.200
 having an external diameter of 3 cm and an internal diameter of 2.75 cm. 

00:02:27.533 --> 00:02:32.666
 Then we will assign a height of about 6 cm. 

00:02:32.666 --> 00:02:34.532
 Now we go to align it: 

00:02:34.533 --> 00:02:37.566
 so here is a cylinder on top of the other. 

00:02:37.566 --> 00:02:39.599
 Now let's position it slightly lower. 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:51.233
 Let us remember to use 25 subdivisions on the sides and a single vertical subdivision. 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.666
 Here is therefore realized the space of the lamp. 

00:02:57.666 --> 00:02:59.832
 If we wanted we could do it even more often. 

00:03:03.733 --> 00:03:10.466
 Now let's proceed with the placement of these objects: 

00:03:10.466 --> 00:03:12.099
 let's position them at this height. 

00:03:15.466 --> 00:03:18.732
 The attack, of course, will be at the height of the false ceiling. 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:34.966
 Well, let's review these objects and their alignment, which looks perfect. 

00:03:37.466 --> 00:03:42.366
 We evaluate their height inside the window and see 

00:03:42.366 --> 00:03:45.832
 that we could have a lower one and a slightly higher one. 

00:03:45.833 --> 00:03:50.033
 Let's create a copy of these light fixtures, 

00:03:50.033 --> 00:03:53.066
 or if we wish we can also make an instance. 

00:03:53.066 --> 00:03:55.866
 Now let's go and position it, 

00:03:55.866 --> 00:04:00.132
 checking that this space is equal to this one, in a visual way. 

00:04:11.233 --> 00:04:15.266
 Then I take this object and carry it slightly higher, 

00:04:15.266 --> 00:04:19.366
 going to align it visually to this line, 

00:04:19.366 --> 00:04:21.866
 while this one will be slightly lower. 

00:04:21.866 --> 00:04:28.399
 Use these references to be able to better align your objects. 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:31.200
 Now we are ready to create two thin cylinders. 

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:35.133
 Place them around the inside of our object. 

00:04:39.033 --> 00:04:43.033
 Let's position ourselves in the front view and create the cylinder: 

00:04:43.033 --> 00:04:48.299
 this time it will have 18 subdivisions since it is not necessary to assign a high value. 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:52.066
 We carry this cylinder up high. 

00:04:52.066 --> 00:04:59.466
 Copy the cylinder, place it more or less in the center of the other element, 

00:04:59.466 --> 00:05:01.899
 using a variety of ways: moving, 

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:06.566
 the variation in height, the scale, the modification of the polygonal object or even slice plane. 

00:05:06.566 --> 00:05:11.932
 In this way we would have realized the support cord. 

00:05:11.933 --> 00:05:18.566
 Let's look slightly at the radius that may be at this point equal to 0.2 cm: 

00:05:18.566 --> 00:05:21.399
 this to give a more sober and delicate stem. 

00:05:28.933 --> 00:05:31.533
 Now let's create a Spring type object. 

00:05:37.766 --> 00:05:41.432
 It is located within the Dynamic Objects sub-category. 

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:56.633
 We place this spring vertically at the starting point of our lamp. 

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:08.600
 Let's change its height, also linking it to objects. 

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:12.800
 Let's bring it up and assign a diameter of 3.5 cm. 

00:06:16.766 --> 00:06:24.699
 We can define how many times it will go around the object, 

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:28.066
 how many loops make up our thread and the diameter of the thread itself. 

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:36.466
 We make a copy that we will place on the other lamp. 

00:06:36.466 --> 00:06:39.566
 At this point we perform a random rotation. 

00:06:39.566 --> 00:06:42.766
 We verify that our copy is centered on the axes. 

00:06:48.933 --> 00:06:51.033
 We could change the height of our object 

00:06:51.033 --> 00:06:55.266
 but in doing so the coils will be changed. 

00:06:55.266 --> 00:07:00.032
 I recommend right clicking, converting the object into a poly, 

00:07:00.033 --> 00:07:02.933
 select the polygons you want to cut, 

00:07:02.933 --> 00:07:07.366
 obviously enable the slice plane command, place it in the space, 

00:07:07.366 --> 00:07:12.932
 make a cut, dissect the uncut polygons and delete them. 

00:07:12.933 --> 00:07:25.799
 We can now connect our object with the other elements of the same material 

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:30.600
 and we give them the name support_lamps. 

00:07:35.066 --> 00:07:38.532
 These other tubes convert them into poly, 

00:07:38.533 --> 00:07:41.799
 I connect them together 

00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:44.833
 and I name them in vetro_lampade. 

00:07:56.833 --> 00:07:58.533
 Here is our scene. 

00:07:58.533 --> 00:08:02.633
 We redisplay all the objects and here are the lamps positioned inside 

00:08:02.633 --> 00:08:04.999
 of the space of our scene.
