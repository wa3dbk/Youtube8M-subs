00:00:11.283 --> 00:00:13.700
Zippy the Zebra

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:18.450
Retold by BookBox

00:00:18.783 --> 00:00:20.783
Zippy had walked

00:00:20.783 --> 00:00:21.533
a long distance

00:00:21.533 --> 00:00:23.783
in the African savannah

00:00:23.783 --> 00:00:28.450
to reach a small lake.

00:00:29.033 --> 00:00:30.367
He eagerly quenched his thirst

00:00:30.367 --> 00:00:31.950
He eagerly quenched his thirst

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:33.617
and went to rest

00:00:33.617 --> 00:00:35.867
under the cool shade of a baobab tree.

00:00:35.867 --> 00:00:39.783
under the cool shade of a baobab tree.

00:00:39.783 --> 00:00:41.700
Zippy tried to fall asleep

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.117
Zippy tried to fall asleep

00:00:43.117 --> 00:00:46.367
but he felt uncomfortable

00:00:46.367 --> 00:00:49.617
and very itchy.

00:00:49.617 --> 00:00:51.783
For days,

00:00:51.783 --> 00:00:53.617
there had been tiny fleas

00:00:53.617 --> 00:00:55.617
all over his body.

00:00:55.617 --> 00:00:57.867
He tried to get rid of the fleas

00:00:57.867 --> 00:01:00.200
by swishing his tail

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:02.783
from side to side.

00:01:02.783 --> 00:01:04.867
He tried to get rid of the fleas

00:01:04.867 --> 00:01:05.783
by thumping his four legs

00:01:05.783 --> 00:01:07.450
by thumping his four legs

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:09.533
one by one

00:01:09.533 --> 00:01:13.367
on the ground.

00:01:15.617 --> 00:01:17.367
He rubbed his whole body

00:01:17.367 --> 00:01:20.117
against the tree trunk.

00:01:20.117 --> 00:01:21.367
He tried to get rid of

00:01:21.367 --> 00:01:22.617
some fleas

00:01:22.617 --> 00:01:24.200
by licking his face

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:28.617
with his long tongue.

00:01:29.617 --> 00:01:32.700
But nothing seemed to work!

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.950
The fleas just wouldn’t go away!

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:38.783
No swishing or licking,

00:01:38.783 --> 00:01:40.033
No swishing or licking,

00:01:40.033 --> 00:01:41.700
and no rubbing and thumping,

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.700
could make them leave him.

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:48.450
Finally, he became so tired

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.200
and irritated

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:52.450
that he rolled on the ground

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:53.450
with his feet up in the air.

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:57.867
with his feet up in the air.

00:02:05.867 --> 00:02:08.367
He saw two little birds

00:02:08.367 --> 00:02:09.700
perched on a branch

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:11.617
of the mighty baobab.

00:02:11.617 --> 00:02:12.783
They made a lot of noise,

00:02:12.783 --> 00:02:16.367
winked at each other

00:02:16.367 --> 00:02:20.950
and darted down.

00:02:21.533 --> 00:02:25.283
“Wow, that was something.

00:02:25.283 --> 00:02:26.617
Are you O.K., Pick?”

00:02:26.617 --> 00:02:28.533
“Sure, Peck, I’m fine!

00:02:28.533 --> 00:02:31.200
Ehh- hi, I’m Pick!”

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:35.700
“And I am Peck, hi!”

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:36.283
Zippy got to his feet.

00:02:36.283 --> 00:02:38.200
Zippy got to his feet.

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:39.617
“Ahem, nice to meet you.

00:02:39.617 --> 00:02:41.367
“Ahem, nice to meet you.

00:02:41.367 --> 00:02:43.700
I am Zippy.”

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:44.700
“You have such deliciously tempting fleas on you!”

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:48.867
“You have such deliciously tempting fleas on you!”

00:02:48.867 --> 00:02:50.200
Pick and Peck settled down

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:51.783
Pick and Peck settled down

00:02:51.783 --> 00:02:53.950
on Zippy’s back.

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:54.867
“Delicious?” groaned Zippy,

00:02:54.867 --> 00:02:57.367
“Delicious?” groaned Zippy,

00:02:57.367 --> 00:02:58.700
“I am totally bugged by them!

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:00.283
I just can’t get them off,

00:03:00.283 --> 00:03:05.367
no matter how hard I try.”

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:09.283
“We are very hungry, Zippy,

00:03:09.283 --> 00:03:12.450
and we love fleas.

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:13.950
May we eat up all these…

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:16.617
nasty creatures?”

00:03:16.617 --> 00:03:19.283
asked Pick and Peck.

00:03:19.283 --> 00:03:19.867
“Sure!

00:03:19.867 --> 00:03:21.617
Be my guests!”

00:03:21.617 --> 00:03:27.033
exclaimed Zippy delighted.

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:28.283
The birds began. They pecked at the fleas

00:03:28.283 --> 00:03:30.033
The birds began. They pecked at the fleas

00:03:30.033 --> 00:03:34.450
on his face and legs,

00:03:34.783 --> 00:03:36.533
they cleaned Zippy’s belly

00:03:36.533 --> 00:03:39.367
and cleaned Zippy’s back.

00:03:39.367 --> 00:03:41.450
The zebra stood still,

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:43.033
letting the birds eat their fill.

00:03:43.033 --> 00:03:47.700
letting the birds eat their fill.

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:52.200
And finally, they were all happy.

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:54.117
The zebra had been freed

00:03:54.117 --> 00:03:55.117
of the annoying fleas

00:03:55.117 --> 00:03:56.367
of the annoying fleas

00:03:56.367 --> 00:03:57.533
and the two birds

00:03:57.533 --> 00:04:02.533
had enjoyed a splendid meal.

00:04:02.783 --> 00:04:04.033
“Thank you very much

00:04:04.033 --> 00:04:05.617
for pecking those nasty fleas

00:04:05.617 --> 00:04:09.617
off my body.”

00:04:09.617 --> 00:04:11.617
“Oh! We must thank you,

00:04:11.617 --> 00:04:13.033
for providing us

00:04:13.033 --> 00:04:14.283
with such a flea meal – free meal.”

00:04:14.283 --> 00:04:17.367
with such a flea meal – free meal.”

00:04:17.367 --> 00:04:19.117
Animals helping each other –

00:04:19.117 --> 00:04:20.200
as Pick and Peck

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:21.950
helped Zippy –

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:23.450
is called symbiosis.

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:25.033
is called symbiosis.

00:04:25.033 --> 00:04:27.783
is called symbiosis.
