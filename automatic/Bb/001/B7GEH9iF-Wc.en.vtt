how the lemur editor can help you come
up<00:03:10.120> with<00:03:10.330> some<00:03:10.599> controller<00:03:11.050> design<00:03:11.530> ideas<00:03:12.090> now

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:13.090 
up with some controller design ideas now

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:14.760 
up with some controller design ideas now
creating<00:03:13.510> a<00:03:13.569> controller<00:03:13.959> is<00:03:14.200> a<00:03:14.230> two-part

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:14.770 
creating a controller is a two-part

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:17.309 
creating a controller is a two-part
process<00:03:15.040> the<00:03:15.640> first<00:03:15.910> of<00:03:16.060> which<00:03:16.270> is<00:03:16.599> creating

00:03:17.309 --> 00:03:17.319 
process the first of which is creating

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:19.290 
process the first of which is creating
the<00:03:17.470> layout<00:03:17.860> you're<00:03:18.640> gonna<00:03:18.790> want<00:03:19.060> to<00:03:19.120> have<00:03:19.270> a

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:19.300 
the layout you're gonna want to have a

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:21.360 
the layout you're gonna want to have a
plan<00:03:19.630> as<00:03:19.959> to<00:03:20.230> where<00:03:20.500> the<00:03:20.650> controls<00:03:21.069> on<00:03:21.250> your

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:21.370 
plan as to where the controls on your

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:23.550 
plan as to where the controls on your
interface<00:03:21.730> should<00:03:22.660> go<00:03:22.900> and<00:03:23.140> how<00:03:23.319> it's<00:03:23.470> gonna

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:23.560 
interface should go and how it's gonna

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:25.680 
interface should go and how it's gonna
look<00:03:23.680> like<00:03:23.860> the<00:03:24.280> second<00:03:24.700> part<00:03:24.730> is<00:03:25.150> actually

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:25.690 
look like the second part is actually

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:28.260 
look like the second part is actually
mapping<00:03:26.020> those<00:03:26.290> controls<00:03:26.830> to<00:03:27.520> the<00:03:27.819> software

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:28.270 
mapping those controls to the software

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:30.000 
mapping those controls to the software
that<00:03:28.480> you<00:03:28.569> want<00:03:28.750> to<00:03:28.840> use<00:03:29.020> in<00:03:29.200> this<00:03:29.709> case

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:30.010 
that you want to use in this case

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:32.400 
that you want to use in this case
tractor<00:03:30.760> we're<00:03:31.510> just<00:03:31.660> gonna<00:03:31.810> cover<00:03:32.050> how<00:03:32.380> you

tractor we're just gonna cover how you
can<00:03:32.769> make<00:03:32.920> your<00:03:33.040> layout<00:03:33.400> in<00:03:33.580> this<00:03:33.760> video<00:03:34.110> so

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:35.110 
can make your layout in this video so

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:36.270 
can make your layout in this video so
