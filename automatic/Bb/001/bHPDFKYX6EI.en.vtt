00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
qualification well yes if you qualify in

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.490 
qualification well yes if you qualify in
first<00:02:43.470> place<00:02:43.650> you<00:02:43.950> get<00:02:44.129> to<00:02:44.310> pick<00:02:44.579> your<00:02:44.849> gate

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500 
first place you get to pick your gate

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:48.580 
first place you get to pick your gate
now<00:02:46.500> that<00:02:46.709> can<00:02:46.950> be<00:02:46.980> very<00:02:47.129> advantageous

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:48.590 
now that can be very advantageous

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:51.130 
now that can be very advantageous
especially<00:02:49.590> if<00:02:49.650> there's<00:02:49.829> a<00:02:49.920> corner<00:02:50.220> straight

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:51.140 
especially if there's a corner straight

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:55.550 
especially if there's a corner straight
after<00:02:52.140> you<00:02:52.950> start<00:02:53.400> your<00:02:53.849> race<00:02:54.150> so<00:02:54.720> it's<00:02:54.900> it's<00:02:55.500> a

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
after you start your race so it's it's a

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:01.160 
after you start your race so it's it's a
very<00:02:55.590> wise<00:02:56.329> decision<00:02:57.329> to<00:02:57.680> pick<00:02:59.000> the<00:03:00.000> most<00:03:00.239> at

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
very wise decision to pick the most at

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:04.369 
very wise decision to pick the most at
gate<00:03:02.000> now<00:03:03.000> you<00:03:03.060> can<00:03:03.390> see<00:03:03.540> from<00:03:03.750> this<00:03:03.870> game<00:03:04.109> it

00:03:04.369 --> 00:03:04.379 
gate now you can see from this game it

00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:07.280 
gate now you can see from this game it

and<00:03:11.840> believe<00:03:12.840> me<00:03:12.870> getting<00:03:13.799> used<00:03:13.980> to<00:03:14.129> the

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250 
and believe me getting used to the

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:17.990 
and believe me getting used to the

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
controller system of this game is no

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.280 
controller system of this game is no

mean feat it uses or utilizes both

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:25.399 
mean feat it uses or utilizes both
analog<00:03:22.889> controllers<00:03:23.989> obviously<00:03:24.989> the<00:03:25.139> left

00:03:25.399 --> 00:03:25.409 
analog controllers obviously the left

00:03:25.409 --> 00:03:28.550 
analog controllers obviously the left
thumbstick<00:03:26.359> controls<00:03:27.359> your<00:03:27.540> steering<00:03:27.840> but

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560 
thumbstick controls your steering but

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:31.039 
thumbstick controls your steering but
the<00:03:28.680> right<00:03:28.950> thumbstick<00:03:29.489> controls<00:03:30.239> your<00:03:30.389> lean

00:03:31.039 --> 00:03:31.049 
the right thumbstick controls your lean

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:34.220 
the right thumbstick controls your lean
now<00:03:31.440> lean<00:03:32.299> doesn't<00:03:33.299> just<00:03:33.480> affect<00:03:33.810> leaning

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:34.230 
now lean doesn't just affect leaning

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:36.259 
now lean doesn't just affect leaning
into<00:03:34.349> corners<00:03:34.829> like<00:03:35.010> here<00:03:35.310> start<00:03:35.819> to<00:03:35.879> press

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:39.589 
into corners like here start to press
right<00:03:36.510> to<00:03:37.200> lean<00:03:37.379> right<00:03:37.680> but<00:03:38.639> it<00:03:38.849> also<00:03:39.030> controls

00:03:39.589 --> 00:03:39.599 
right to lean right but it also controls

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:42.030 
right to lean right but it also controls
your<00:03:39.930> forward<00:03:40.500> and<00:03:40.739> backward<00:03:41.459> swings

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:42.040 
your forward and backward swings

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:44.610 
your forward and backward swings
when<00:03:42.189> you<00:03:42.310> get<00:03:42.459> a<00:03:42.489> jump<00:03:42.730> like<00:03:42.819> this<00:03:43.170> if<00:03:44.170> you

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:44.620 
when you get a jump like this if you

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:50.130 
when you get a jump like this if you
press<00:03:44.980> back<00:03:45.189> your<00:03:46.150> bike<00:03:46.420> will<00:03:48.090> fly<00:03:49.090> further<00:03:49.540> or

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:50.140 
press back your bike will fly further or

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:52.289 
press back your bike will fly further or
if<00:03:50.200> you<00:03:50.349> press<00:03:50.530> forwards<00:03:51.010> you<00:03:51.310> will<00:03:51.969> point

if you press forwards you will point

00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:55.949 
if you press forwards you will point
your<00:03:52.959> bike<00:03:53.260> downwards<00:03:54.129> when<00:03:54.489> in<00:03:54.670> the<00:03:54.790> air<00:03:54.959> you

00:03:55.949 --> 00:03:55.959 
your bike downwards when in the air you

00:03:55.959 --> 00:03:58.410 
your bike downwards when in the air you
can<00:03:56.140> also<00:03:56.489> give<00:03:57.489> your<00:03:57.609> bike<00:03:57.849> a<00:03:57.879> little<00:03:58.090> tail

00:03:58.410 --> 00:03:58.420 
can also give your bike a little tail

00:03:58.420 --> 00:03:59.009 
can also give your bike a little tail

whip me

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:03.569 
whip me
so<00:03:59.200> you<00:03:59.760> do<00:04:00.760> not<00:04:01.060> fly<00:04:01.480> as<00:04:01.689> far<00:04:02.069> and<00:04:03.069> it's<00:04:03.400> all
