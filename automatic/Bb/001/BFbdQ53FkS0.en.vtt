00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:08.840 
we're going to put in some fog lights

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:11.260 
we're going to put in some fog lights
from<00:00:09.350> factory<00:00:09.710> fog<00:00:09.920> lights<00:00:10.190> and<00:00:10.370> a<00:00:11.000> switch

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:11.270 
from factory fog lights and a switch

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:14.080 
from factory fog lights and a switch
inside<00:00:11.719> that<00:00:12.290> way<00:00:12.440> this<00:00:12.740> s<00:00:12.920> model<00:00:13.459> will<00:00:13.940> be

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:14.090 
inside that way this s model will be

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:16.060 
inside that way this s model will be
similar<00:00:14.389> to<00:00:14.539> an<00:00:14.629> SL<00:00:15.020> with<00:00:15.170> fog<00:00:15.379> lights<00:00:15.650> from

00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:16.070 
similar to an SL with fog lights from

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:17.830 
similar to an SL with fog lights from
the<00:00:16.100> factory<00:00:16.580> it<00:00:17.060> already<00:00:17.270> has<00:00:17.480> the<00:00:17.630> wires

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:17.840 
the factory it already has the wires

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:20.259 
the factory it already has the wires
pre-wired<00:00:18.560> from<00:00:19.070> the<00:00:19.190> factory<00:00:19.580> we<00:00:19.940> just<00:00:20.090> need

00:00:20.259 --> 00:00:20.269

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:13.410 
up until that ring length

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:15.979 
up until that ring length
scribe<00:03:13.799> edge<00:03:14.010> there<00:03:14.280> that<00:03:14.879> way<00:03:15.090> the<00:03:15.569> fog<00:03:15.780> lamp

I'm<00:03:50.459> just<00:03:50.579> going<00:03:50.700> to<00:03:50.730> use<00:03:50.879> a<00:03:50.910> simple<00:03:51.239> Philips

00:03:51.589 --> 00:03:51.599 
I'm just going to use a simple Philips

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:53.569 
I'm just going to use a simple Philips
screwdriver<00:03:52.019> around<00:03:52.230> underneath<00:03:52.650> the

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:53.579 
screwdriver around underneath the

00:03:53.579 --> 00:03:55.640 
screwdriver around underneath the
steering<00:03:53.880> column<00:03:54.180> cover<00:03:54.569> there's<00:03:55.319> three

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:55.650 
steering column cover there's three

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:58.309 
steering column cover there's three
screws<00:03:56.150> they'll<00:03:57.150> come<00:03:57.299> out<00:03:57.419> once<00:03:58.019> you<00:03:58.139> take

00:03:58.309 --> 00:03:58.319 
screws they'll come out once you take

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:00.620 
screws they'll come out once you take
those<00:03:58.470> out<00:03:58.650> this<00:03:59.489> upper<00:03:59.849> and<00:03:59.970> lower<00:04:00.090> half<00:04:00.389> are

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:00.630 
those out this upper and lower half are

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:03.110 
those out this upper and lower half are
going<00:04:00.989> to<00:04:01.079> pop<00:04:01.290> apart<00:04:01.650> do<00:04:02.250> you<00:04:02.310> seem<00:04:02.519> to<00:04:02.639> kind

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:03.120 
going to pop apart do you seem to kind

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:04.759 
going to pop apart do you seem to kind
of<00:04:03.180> give<00:04:03.660> a<00:04:03.690> little<00:04:03.750> bit<00:04:03.930> of<00:04:04.049> pressure<00:04:04.169> here<00:04:04.620> I

00:04:04.759 --> 00:04:04.769 
of give a little bit of pressure here I

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:06.860 
of give a little bit of pressure here I
recommend<00:04:05.669> letting<00:04:06.419> the<00:04:06.480> steering<00:04:06.720> column

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:06.870 
recommend letting the steering column

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:13.520 
recommend letting the steering column
move<00:04:07.200> so<00:04:08.069> these<00:04:08.190> will<00:04:08.370> actually<00:04:08.639> pop<00:04:08.790> apart

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:13.530 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:15.200 

it's<00:04:14.160> just<00:04:14.400> going<00:04:14.490> to<00:04:14.580> take<00:04:14.730> a<00:04:14.760> little<00:04:15.000> bit<00:04:15.090> of

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:15.210 
it's just going to take a little bit of

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:18.080 
it's just going to take a little bit of
pressure<00:04:15.620> just<00:04:16.620> to<00:04:16.739> get<00:04:16.950> them<00:04:17.040> apart<00:04:17.310> this

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:18.090 
pressure just to get them apart this

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:20.330 
pressure just to get them apart this
upper<00:04:18.480> one<00:04:18.560> will<00:04:19.560> come<00:04:19.739> right<00:04:19.920> out<00:04:19.950> and<00:04:20.280> you

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:20.340 
upper one will come right out and you

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:22.340 
upper one will come right out and you
can<00:04:20.489> just<00:04:20.609> set<00:04:20.700> on<00:04:20.820> the<00:04:20.880> floor<00:04:21.120> you<00:04:22.079> can<00:04:22.200> take

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:22.350 
can just set on the floor you can take

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:26.450

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:30.890 

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:33.260 

and<00:04:31.890> just<00:04:32.010> remember<00:04:32.340> everything's<00:04:32.730> tight<00:04:32.970> so
