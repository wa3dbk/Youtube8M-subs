00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:08.160
 hello today I'm going to show you a recipe 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:10.740
 very simple it is a stew of 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.809
 ribs with potatoes is a recipe 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.369
 easy and if you do not know how to cook a lot 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:17.030
 perfect because it has very few 

00:00:14.369 --> 00:00:20.210
 ingredients and is very rich 

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:23.660
 the ingredients are going to be 400 grams of 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:26.630
 marinated ribs two medium potatoes 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:29.300
 a glass of white wine a little 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:32.150
 pepper three bay leaves and one 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:34.010
 medium onion is important not to throw 

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:35.930
 salt since the rib of being or of 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:38.870
 badaia is going to give a lot of flavor to the 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:40.309
 sauce at first we only have 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:44.660
 to put a little bit of olive oil 

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:47.690
 in a pan over medium heat over 67 and 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:50.410
 add the onion 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:53.149
 let's let it be done little by little 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:56.410
 stirring until the onion is very 

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:56.410
 very very pochada 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:01.469
 here we see how the onion is already 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:01.469
 golden 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:06.960
 so we can only add the 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:06.960
 Pepper 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:13.810
 we have raised the fire to the maximum so that 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:16.480
 the meat is now roasted quickly and not 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:18.990
 release a lot of juice and let's add the 

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:18.990
 ribs 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:29.140
 we continue stirring when the meat 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:32.640
 the next one is more or less golden 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:32.640
 step is going to be add the white wine 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:37.670
 but in front 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:43.890
 if we see that with white wine there is little 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:46.310
 broth the best thing is to add a glass of 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.310
 Water 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:50.960
 in this case the wine is very scarce 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:53.270
 because to realize that now it's going to 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:56.330
 be simmering 20-25 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:58.180
 minutes so let's add a glass 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:01.150
 of water 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:04.360
 and let's let it start cooking 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:06.670
 for 20 to 25 minutes control 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:08.679
 whenever there is water so that we are not 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:11.080
 hit and until you see that the meat 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:12.700
 it's practically done after 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:14.660
 we will throw the potato again and 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:17.960
 we will have the cheese ready 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:20.090
 we've had it 20 minutes on a gentle fire 

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:22.520
 so now we just need to take the 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:24.560
 Potato trick to put the potato 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:28.600
 take the potato you take a knife and in 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:30.690
 instead of cutting, let's go throwing 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:33.450
 you hear a little bit even 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:36.230
 in this way the sauce will catch a lot 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:36.230
 more thickness 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:40.790
 Nothing, we just have to wait 15 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:43.099
 minutes the potato states there 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:45.349
 we have the plate ready here we have 

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:47.390
 ready our ribs with potatoes 

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:49.700
