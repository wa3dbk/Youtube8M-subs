00:00:05.839 --> 00:00:11.630
 Hello everyone, Alex and today I wanted 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:15.990
 to talk about gaming laptops 

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:18.270
 purchase or assembly you will be surprised 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.410
 probably that such an assembly after laptops 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.980
 as if ready 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:25.980
 probably you have not heard what is cool and 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:28.400
 exactly what is being created on this base 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:32.390
 separate laptops are companies like 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:35.100
 sailer evrokom dns this which in Russia 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:37.890
 in Ukraine he has not reached us yet 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:40.140
 Sorry if you build a laptop for 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:43.200
 it's better to do that 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:45.390
 because you can shove it in there 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:48.149
 want to use and easy later on 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.399
 change because it's all easy 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:52.770
 replaceable even at home with 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:55.260
 little experience miss you at least 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:57.570
 once touched on this topic when 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.640
 buying an already finished laptop first 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:03.329
 all I want to call your attention is 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:05.489
 on the screen since not on the processor not on 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:07.619
 keyboard namely the screen you will 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:10.380
 watch most of your time and 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:12.390
 I think this is logical next I want 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:15.710
 note that everyone wants in pursuit 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:18.240
 I advise you to pay attention to 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:20.640
 CPU which is also for cooling 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:23.490
 which is worth it if you take 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:26.250
 there seems to be a good there on a 2s video card 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:29.159
 also with nuclear frequencies with frequencies 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:32.070
 kernel it gives good results on 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:34.650
 let's say you and processors on it 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.930
 intelovskie between and it stands only 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:39.960
 one cooler that is both on the video card and on 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:42.990
 the processor and you and he is a thin laptop 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:46.590
 an ultrabook that might not 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:48.960
 happens if he overheats he 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.820
 will reset the frequencies ie first 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:54.210
 ten minutes of the game you will see there 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:56.820
 unreal 60fps well as for the ultrabook 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:02:00.149
 so let's say and after that there will be a fall 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:03.329
 up to 20-30 that is, and can even walk to 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:06.260
 15 is no longer playable, but the cause will be 

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:08.780
 not even a process video card 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:11.060
 About the video card I want to note something 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:13.160
 that many manufacturers seem to be with 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:16.010
 one filling but sell for different 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:17.150
 money in this regard although take into account 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:19.550
 it is a video card 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:22.970
 about the video card there is such a catch as 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:25.310
 several types of memory in it though 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:27.860
 be two gigabytes at least gigabyte or 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:29.630
 let's say the same amount but 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:32.030
 this laptop cost significantly 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:35.540
 different it may be due not 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:38.440
 only brand so to speak, and a laptop 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:41.570
 how this video card works 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:44.390
 frequencies and and again there are understatement 

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:46.660
 data buses as well 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:49.280
 precisely with the type of memory controller itself 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:52.370
 after that I want to note more hard 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:55.970
 drive many chase either big 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:58.700
 hard drive or ssd drive what 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:00.890
 not always rationally big hard 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:03.410
 low-speed drive 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:08.020
 effective speed as the same but 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:10.610
 all 200 also ssd-drive it though 

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:12.530
 works instantly but has a very 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:14.660
 limited life is that 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:17.180
 manufacturers indicated there millions of years 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:20.239
 these are far from certain sectors 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:22.850
 dying there after a few rewrites he 

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:24.830
 overwrite another section and how would 

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:27.290
 visually see normal hard 

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:29.269
 drive everything is fine with him but he 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:32.420
 slowly dying right from the first 

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:35.060
 of the moment to use and also note that 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:38.209
 that you should not chase the weight of laptops 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:40.640
 since miracles do not happen on this 

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:43.130
 the very weight if it is not taken from the body 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:46.310
 taken from something else will 

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:48.470
 affect and overall laptop performance 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:51.200
 such as cooling that is massive 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:54.170
 radiator and lightweight laptop can not put 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:56.780
 a big battery won't put that either 

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:58.760
 write milliampere hours let's say it's not 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:01.100
 means the laptop will work from 

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:03.730
 these figure abstruse amount of time 

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:06.830
 most likely he will either be good 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:08.930
 work but two times less or very 

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:11.390
 slow down but claimed 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:13.910
 the amount of time that is miracles like 

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:16.220
 I said no more about 

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:17.889
 RAM I want to say on 

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:20.650
 today and 

00:04:17.889 --> 00:04:23.379
 6 gigabytes I think with enough head 4 

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:25.659
 maybe in some tasks it is not enough but 8 

00:04:23.379 --> 00:04:28.180
 this is a bust and if the laptop 8 is not 

00:04:25.659 --> 00:04:31.180
 chase 1632 

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:33.969
 and the like but in effectiveness in 

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:37.539
 I do nâ€™t bear this life I think my advice 

00:04:33.969 --> 00:04:40.740
 will help you choose a laptop good luck to everyone 

00:04:37.539 --> 00:04:40.740
 Thank you for watching
