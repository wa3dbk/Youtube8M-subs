one<00:00:08.760> piece<00:00:08.970> anime<00:00:09.330> mainly<00:00:09.780> because<00:00:09.929> I'm

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:10.170 
one piece anime mainly because I'm

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:12.080 
one piece anime mainly because I'm
always<00:00:10.320> shaky<00:00:10.860> with<00:00:10.980> that<00:00:11.190> one<00:00:11.400> it's<00:00:11.550> like<00:00:11.580> you

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
always shaky with that one it's like you

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:13.459

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
know how the one piece anime could be

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:15.289 
know how the one piece anime could be
and<00:00:13.769> I<00:00:13.830> think<00:00:13.889> a<00:00:14.190> comic<00:00:14.549> got<00:00:14.700> killers<00:00:15.030> another
