00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:05.960
 here I am trying this thing to show you 

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:09.610
 I live as if 

00:00:11.069 --> 00:00:14.889
 with one hand to the throat the wuebcam and with the other I try to 

00:00:14.889 --> 00:00:17.889
 paint but I assure you a mess 

00:00:19.509 --> 00:00:21.220
 especially because you will see 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:24.220
 top 

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:38.170
 while all very very illuminated even too strong 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:44.830
 this painting I'm doing is taken from a photo of my mind 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:49.750
 it's a photo 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.750
 balance weighing 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:56.750
 of photos of children called c is a game 

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:00.920
 heard the pronunciation actions 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:03.920
 and text edreams via marina 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:12.930
 it escapes me 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.509
 between a c 

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:19.169

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:34.680
 hey 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.370
 I tend to be painting 

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:39.049
 when you are silent 

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:41.880
 but I realize that I'll make you a video 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.320
 oreste 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.550
 hospital say something hand bags

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:54.280

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:56.620
 the rest of the watercolor 

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:58.710
 you don't see my mind 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.330
 the realized 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:02.740
 This morning 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:05.350
 together with the white marine nutella 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:08.729
 nemo painted together at school a beautiful day this morning today 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.389
 afternoon 

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:13.979
 this morning we had a fight 

00:02:13.979 --> 00:02:16.889
 this came even late 

00:02:16.889 --> 00:02:19.909
 read afternoon we painted 

00:02:19.909 --> 00:02:22.909
 then I must be very careful because 

00:02:24.149 --> 00:02:25.090
 shoes 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:29.750
 unfortunately with watercolor the newspaper will need a lot 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:33.139
 if you can't throw it at random 

00:02:33.139 --> 00:02:36.259
 because the white parts but left white 

00:02:37.579 --> 00:02:40.539
 inductor white nights if then 

00:02:40.539 --> 00:02:43.539
 you and cover 

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:48.309
 meetcb sees something 

00:02:48.309 --> 00:02:51.309
 I marrow 

00:02:54.469 --> 00:02:57.469
 death sensitivity is approaching 

00:02:58.379 --> 00:03:01.299
 dvd not even nausea 

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:04.299
 it is good I go on like this 

00:03:07.259 --> 00:03:09.969
 year you see nothing at all 

00:03:09.969 --> 00:03:12.199
 because unfortunately this 

00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:15.199
 color this pink is very clear 

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:18.959
 and that of the photo is very clear 

00:03:20.409 --> 00:03:25.499
 and therefore trying to maintain a sort of coherence with the photo 

00:03:26.499 --> 00:03:29.499
 I had to make a color in your buttocks 

00:03:31.479 --> 00:03:34.479
 a couple of hours 

00:03:37.659 --> 00:03:41.230
 although in the meantime the cartasÃ¬ is nicely dry 

00:03:42.089 --> 00:03:44.059
 then in this case 

00:03:44.059 --> 00:03:47.309
 it's not a problem because I'm using that card 

00:03:47.309 --> 00:03:50.309
 elaine montale in the song 

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:53.839
 which is a card 

00:03:53.839 --> 00:03:57.299
 I had already talked about it on purpose 

00:03:57.299 --> 00:03:59.289
 let's say from the studio 

00:03:59.289 --> 00:04:02.299
 to study a little or a watercolor 

00:04:02.299 --> 00:04:04.009
 for which 

00:04:04.009 --> 00:04:07.279
 it's a card that you can 

00:04:07.279 --> 00:04:09.519
 progressive lenses 

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:12.519
 from that one room is easily erased 

00:04:13.499 --> 00:04:17.079
 while a normal watercolor paper of cotton 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:20.779
 would not allow this 

00:04:20.779 --> 00:04:23.779
 this thing 

00:04:28.819 --> 00:04:31.279
 among other things to make greens 

00:04:31.279 --> 00:04:34.069
 to make the background greens 

00:04:34.069 --> 00:04:36.110
 I used 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:41.650
 and instead of the usual maimeri watercolors I used id higuin seregno 

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:42.030
 tel 

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:43.159

00:04:43.159 --> 00:04:44.930
 in my friend 

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:45.900
 eeeh 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:47.140
 you can see 

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:49.750
 even with this beckham love he doesn't have 

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:53.000
 surely the fantastic color rendering can see how much 

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.090
 difference is there 

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:56.439
 between winsor &amp; newton 

00:04:56.439 --> 00:04:59.029
 as pigmentation which therefore e 

00:04:59.029 --> 00:05:03.209
 it is beautiful intense pigment load the color and respect up 

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:07.099
 the other painted design I made you 

00:05:07.099 --> 00:05:10.099
 ibs no is not a picture I showed 

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:16.550
 the design, however, also look only at this green 

00:05:17.279 --> 00:05:19.199
 that of the maimeri 

00:05:19.199 --> 00:05:21.740
 the green of winsor &amp; newton 

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:24.779
 ecole quantity 

00:05:24.779 --> 00:05:27.379
 that is, you see very clearly clearly

00:05:31.719 --> 00:05:34.389
 the brightness of this green 

00:05:34.389 --> 00:05:37.029
 respect 

00:05:37.029 --> 00:05:40.689

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:44.300

 the sheet the quality paper the same because notebook not of deception 

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:52.559
 - mashed potato 

00:05:52.559 --> 00:05:56.939
 in fact, I know that sooner or later I'll make a nice investment 

00:05:58.479 --> 00:06:00.879
 and I'll take it 

00:06:00.879 --> 00:06:03.879
 a little yellow in color 

00:06:04.419 --> 00:06:08.360
 you can find the colors of the queen strill.it archery sparta a little tube 

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:10.569
 of the maimeri that is so 

00:06:10.569 --> 00:06:13.379
 so I show it 

00:06:13.379 --> 00:06:16.150
 next to my hand
