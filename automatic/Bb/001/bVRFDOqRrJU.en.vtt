00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:16.360
 hello everyone today we will see th together 

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:18.010
 lv 200 result of one of the Chinese brands 

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:19.840
 most appreciated and enters by right 

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:21.730
 among the best android smartphones in 

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:23.010
 circulation with a price lower than 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:25.360
 200 euros 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.160
 aesthetically it presents itself with a look 

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:29.500
 dominated by the presence of materials 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:32.050
 the kun is plastic though of good quality 

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:34.210
 more than convincing assembly 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:36.129
 the large display or almost all 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:38.920
 of the surface leaving the rest 

00:00:36.129 --> 00:00:41.890
 space for the three classic android and keys 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:43.809
 to the front camera the dimensions 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:47.860
 include an average thickness of 

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:49.450
 9.3 mm while the weight of 155 grams e 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:51.250
 higher than what is permissible 

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:54.160
 expect from a smartphone from 5 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:56.980
 thumbs in hand is decidedly 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:58.510
 convenient and economical also thanks to 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:59.760
 square design that facilitates the 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:02.410
 socket 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.089
 unlike the usual micro door 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:05.020
 usb is placed at the center of the board 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:07.270
 higher 

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:10.300
 next to the 3.5 mm jack for the 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:12.759
 earphones on both sides are present 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:15.940
 Power button in the button 

00:01:12.759 --> 00:01:18.729
 volume adjustment on the back is well 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:20.259
 visible thl logo above which 

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:22.539
 the 8 megapixel camera stands out 

00:01:20.259 --> 00:01:24.130
 alongside the LED flash with 

00:01:22.539 --> 00:01:26.340
 the speaker can the part 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:26.340
 lower 

00:01:26.349 --> 00:01:32.920
 the 5 inch lcd screen is type 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:36.819
 ips the run solution hd or 1280 x 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:40.390
 720 pixels giving thl v200 a 

00:01:36.819 --> 00:01:42.670
 pixel density of 293 ppi la 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:44.500
 outdoor visibility is excellent as well 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:46.209
 viewing angles offering the 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:48.429
 ability to observe the screen 

00:01:46.209 --> 00:01:51.550
 also different directions than 

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:53.530
 the perpendicular one here sins it in e 

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:55.660
 reflections that are more evident 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:57.970
 compared to the levels we are used to 

00:01:55.660 --> 00:02:00.039
 perhaps because of the presence of a glass 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:01.330
 different from the gorilla glass that is due 

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:04.270
 instead of the smartphones of the range 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:06.250
 above the level of the university 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:07.300
 maximum is sufficient for the average 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:09.340
 guarantee good visibility 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:12.099
 outdoors in low light conditions 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:14.650
 a level of around 30 40 percent 

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:16.569
 of the interiors and about 50 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:18.459
 60 percent outdoors is right 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:20.510
 compromise between readability and consumption 

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:23.689
 of the battery 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:25.159
 at the hardware level the lv 200 is equipped 

00:02:23.689 --> 00:02:28.909
 of the most recent mediatek processor 

00:02:25.159 --> 00:02:33.470
 that is the turbo version of the mtk 65 89 

00:02:28.909 --> 00:02:35.299
 1.5 ghz blocked the ram memory is from 1 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:38.180
 giga but thanks to the good optimization 

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:40.280
 firmware and the absence of applications 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:43.430
 and widgets owners the user experience 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:46.760
 the absence of is fluid and reactive 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:47.989
 hd resolution allowed thl v200 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:50.599
 to reach the remarkable 

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:53.120
 score of over 15,000 points in the test 

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:55.010
 antutu score that live mail 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:58.340
 competition with smartphones of the caliber 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:03:00.590
 of the galaxy s iii impeccable also the 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:02.569
 web browsing characterized by a 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:04.450
 fast loading of pages both in 

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:06.829
 mobile version than in head version 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:09.079
 here we want to report a very good one 

00:03:06.829 --> 00:03:10.849
 reception of the wifi that has proven itself 

00:03:09.079 --> 00:03:14.269
 higher than many other models 

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:16.370
 of houses better known on the front 

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:18.680
 gaming the most common games they don't have 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:20.690
 requirements too high in terms of 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:24.970
 graphic processing are fully 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:24.970
 enjoyable with excellent fluidity 

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:31.129
 switching to more complex games th 

00:03:27.919 --> 00:03:33.349
 lv 200 shows some gaps instead 

00:03:31.129 --> 00:03:35.359
 it manifests itself through some small 

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:37.879
 and sporadic lag that makes the experience 

00:03:35.359 --> 00:03:41.530
 gaming not entirely satisfactory 

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:41.530
 in the eyes of a demanding genre 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:52.140
 nothing to report in the reproduction 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:55.790
 of the hd videos that the chip meditates in 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:55.790
 he can manage without any problem 

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:03.330
 no 

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:14.840
 also the quality of the audio that is discreet 

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:17.230
 shows some distortion only at 

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:17.230
 maximum volume 

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:36.750
 as for the camera it is 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:38.940
 must point out that the promising 

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:41.280
 8 megapixel sensor with LED e 

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:43.020
 autofocus turns out to be actually poor 

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:44.849
 quality 

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:46.590
 the whole day photos reveal a 

00:04:44.849 --> 00:04:48.680
 noise level is above average 

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:51.389
 in addition to a loyalty to the colors rather 

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:53.400
 unsatisfactory 

00:04:51.389 --> 00:04:55.229
 in night shots one is added 

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:57.210
 great general speed that cause the 

00:04:55.229 --> 00:04:58.680
 notable for details in addition to 

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:00.889
 reveal a low level of light he has 

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:02.970
 found outside 

00:05:00.889 --> 00:05:04.530
 this does not alter that if yours 

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:06.120
 goal is just a few shots 

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:08.819
 occasional to share on social media 

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:12.630
 network will fully satisfy yours 

00:05:08.819 --> 00:05:15.449
 needs the camera is also capable 

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:16.889
 to record video at 1080p at 30 frames 

00:05:15.449 --> 00:05:19.050
 per second 

00:05:16.889 --> 00:05:20.940
 but here the lack of a is felt 

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:23.880
 bon digital stabilizer and a 

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:27.330
 dedicated processor to finish the 

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:29.009
 1750 milan battery for now results 

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:31.620
 slightly undersized for a 

00:05:29.009 --> 00:05:33.270
 average user to support can do 

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:35.310
 certainly the second battery is comfortable 

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:36.949
 which is supplied to us e 

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:40.409
 directly from the manufacturer 

00:05:36.949 --> 00:05:42.780
 Finally, we remind you that th 200 lv is 

00:05:40.409 --> 00:05:45.570
 a dual sim smartphone that mounts the 

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:46.949
 stock version of android 4.2 free of 

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:48.419
 customizations by 

00:05:46.949 --> 00:05:49.770
 manufacturer and applications 

00:05:48.419 --> 00:05:51.570
 preinstalled 

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:54.030
 in conclusion we can say that al 

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:56.370
 price of about 170 euros purchased 

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:58.620
 online directly from dinner th

 nv200 is the inexpensive smartphone from 

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:00.960
 value for money that doesn't fear 

00:06:00.389 --> 00:06:04.169
 comparisons 

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:06.389
 dual sim screen hd quad core processor 

00:06:04.169 --> 00:06:08.250
 and more generally an experience of use of 

00:06:06.389 --> 00:06:10.169
 high level that make it the best 

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:13.340
 choice for those who want to get the most with 

00:06:10.169 --> 00:06:13.340
