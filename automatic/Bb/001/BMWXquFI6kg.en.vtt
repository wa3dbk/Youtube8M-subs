00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
is obviously one of its main features

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.500 
is obviously one of its main features
now<00:00:53.010> the<00:00:53.070> note<00:00:53.309> also<00:00:53.550> peppers<00:00:54.059> a<00:00:54.149> screenshot

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
now the note also peppers a screenshot

screen and it'll take a screenshot which
immediately<00:00:58.770> pops<00:00:59.250> up<00:00:59.460> in<00:00:59.640> a<00:00:59.699> photo<00:00:59.940> editor<00:01:01.520> so

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
immediately pops up in a photo editor so

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.100 
immediately pops up in a photo editor so
let's<00:01:02.699> say<00:01:02.910> for<00:01:03.120> example<00:01:03.149> you<00:01:03.690> like<00:01:03.930> the

share it with powers plyo wide variety

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.140 
share it with powers plyo wide variety
of<00:01:09.930> platforms<00:01:10.700> obviously<00:01:11.700> there<00:01:11.909> are<00:01:11.939> more

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
of platforms obviously there are more

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.149

exciting things you can do this is just

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.030 
exciting things you can do this is just
an<00:01:14.520> example<00:01:14.689> what's<00:01:15.689> exciting<00:01:16.080> is<00:01:16.530> it<00:01:16.770> a

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
an example what's exciting is it a

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.039 
an example what's exciting is it a
potential<00:01:17.670> so<00:01:17.759> hopefully<00:01:18.150> we'll<00:01:18.600> see<00:01:18.630> more<00:01:18.990> of

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
potential so hopefully we'll see more of

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.350 
potential so hopefully we'll see more of
this<00:01:19.290> activity<00:01:19.619> in<00:01:20.009> the<00:01:20.159> future<00:01:20.580> now<00:01:21.270> if
