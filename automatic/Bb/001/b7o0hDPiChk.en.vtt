00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.750
 court dear friends here we are now 

00:00:01.750 --> 00:00:02.860
 we are testing 

00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:06.570
 but now with navigation at 0 58 00 cold 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:08.429
 so just not to freeze 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:10.669
 so we lead now in general now 

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:12.249
 we are at the bus stop now 

00:00:12.249 --> 00:00:13.759
 let's see how it behaves 

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:14.589
 cards 

00:00:14.589 --> 00:00:15.990
 actually can 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.560
 she viewed this break 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:21.300
 Here is the rescript of the rim 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.900
 Now the price of a mistake is normal 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:26.319
 nis and still it was more convenient to go 

00:00:26.319 --> 00:00:28.749
 I have now installed 

00:00:28.749 --> 00:00:30.789
 here are the views 

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:33.720
 SCM mode of such a map 

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:36.339
 but theoretically you can somehow put 

00:00:36.339 --> 00:00:38.190
 move the arc and g 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.780
 meters see how it will behave 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:44.520
 after at least 20 meters paused while 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.970
 and look further 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:50.970
 as you can see ml 

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:53.230
 chose the right board 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:56.230
 automatically showed us 

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:59.550
 that's why we are moving exactly because 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.520
 the ways that we laid 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:04.570
 estimated 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:05.820
 smartphone 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.450
 But in general, yes 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:09.370
 in principle, we all understand but we 

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:11.720
 moving 2 kilometers an hour approximately 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:15.140
 left nine minutes of france football 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.520
 In the underground 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.720
 that's why I will most likely turn on 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:22.900
 you are a little closer to the subway because 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:24.670
 Putin on his equal 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:27.120
 so it made special sense 

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:29.690
 no wait i lose 9 minutes 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:30.579
 in the third set 

00:01:30.579 --> 00:01:33.880
 in a few seconds 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:35.729
 and now we deviate a little bit 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:38.539
 the slope which presented to us now with 

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:40.759
 Navigator let's see what will show 

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:42.509
 will show us on the brush on 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.120
 location 

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:46.340
 I now turned left work 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:49.340
 the way they told us 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:54.500
 uah but how would the type shorten the way 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:04.329
 i so we turned left but unfortunately 

00:02:04.329 --> 00:02:07.329
 the holiday is not showing us yet 

00:02:08.079 --> 00:02:10.549
 yes then we walk the same street 

00:02:10.549 --> 00:02:11.989
 but maybe this 

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:13.269
 and 

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:16.269
 but such a small error 

00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:26.009
 so we have a little bit gone 

00:02:26.009 --> 00:02:29.009
 three kilometers per hour function 

00:02:30.189 --> 00:02:31.559
 here we are now a little bit 

00:02:31.559 --> 00:02:34.389
 activated the screen it now us satellite 

00:02:34.389 --> 00:02:36.529
 It shows exactly the exact 

00:02:36.529 --> 00:02:38.859
 whose location 

00:02:38.859 --> 00:02:41.139
 Do you correspond to this area? 

00:02:41.139 --> 00:02:43.509
 Now on 5 we will leave on 

00:02:43.509 --> 00:02:45.899
 walked the street and see what happens 

00:02:45.899 --> 00:02:47.930
 further well actually 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:50.829
 it is already clear that the satellite is being updated 

00:02:50.829 --> 00:02:53.069
 Are you dissatisfied? 

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:55.569
 who said that not the best 

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:56.439
 test 

00:02:56.439 --> 00:02:59.569
 instead of finding a satellite but rather 

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:02.260
 its connecting but exactly 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:03.980
 in the open 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:05.830
 that is, in the house it is better not to do it 

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:07.139
 exactly do it 

00:03:07.139 --> 00:03:08.800
 percentage somewhere 

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:10.440
 turn the map around 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:11.449
 also in principle 

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:12.989
 moves 

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:14.239
 do it in the open 

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:17.720
 once farther for literally 10 15 

00:03:17.719 --> 00:03:19.269
 seconds it will automatically 

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:21.449
 be search 

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:24.449
 that is the truth of which we are 

00:03:28.939 --> 00:03:30.849
 so it's a little closer to 

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:34.359
 obama skill metro enabled leads further 

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:39.249
 but actually we are practically 

00:03:39.249 --> 00:03:41.909
 we are near the subway 

00:03:41.909 --> 00:03:43.829
 pass literally a few dozen 

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:45.409
 meters and turn 

00:03:45.409 --> 00:03:47.769
 on the euro 

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:50.769
 so look further 

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:55.369
 but I understand a few more meters 

00:03:56.009 --> 00:03:58.739
 actually anna pretty open 

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:01.169
 terrain here we have a signal almost 

00:04:01.169 --> 00:04:03.180
 caught a hundred percent 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:05.569
 we can see here here 

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:07.060
 bottom right 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:09.510
 the elements in our way shown beautifully 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:11.569
 those points on the map 

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:13.899
 we can actually remake this card 

00:04:13.899 --> 00:04:14.959
 but no matter how 

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:17.590
 I then automatically give us anand 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:20.079
 will fit up 

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:22.439
 so pause again we will meet probably 

00:04:22.439 --> 00:04:23.669
 all the same at the subway 

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:25.210
 otherwise already 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:27.880
 and the battery is calling my price raw 

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:29.880
 cell phone froze he himself 

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:32.020
 on in volume 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:35.020
 camera camcorder 

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:37.740
 yes but how are you actually mouth 

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:40.580
 I cut Putin a little percentage of that 

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:42.780
 that he offered us Hephaestus navigator 

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:45.780
 automatically but actually it is also 

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:48.009
 right because and we left just 

00:04:48.009 --> 00:04:50.770
 purely Paul council was laid out route 

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:51.919
 by 

00:04:51.919 --> 00:04:54.520
 on one side help cut 

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:56.909
 see you near the subway 

00:04:56.909 --> 00:04:58.639
 but absence including us left 

00:04:58.639 --> 00:05:00.789
 just a few meters pass 

00:05:00.789 --> 00:05:03.789
 and turn left judging by the map 

00:05:04.419 --> 00:05:06.349
 we have a metro station on the left 

00:05:06.349 --> 00:05:09.710
 parties 

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:12.710
 Yalta this we go further 

00:05:19.639 --> 00:05:21.590
 in theory they should have already been brought in general 

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:24.590
 we came 

00:05:29.229 --> 00:05:32.229
 generally so 

00:05:33.009 --> 00:05:35.759
 on our map it seems that we are already 

00:05:35.759 --> 00:05:38.339
 we still have to go literally meters 

00:05:38.339 --> 00:05:40.680
 ten but on the other hand yes we are not 

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:41.999
 should right me 

00:05:41.999 --> 00:05:44.409
 go inside the metro station otherwise the soonest 

00:05:44.409 --> 00:05:47.409
 the signal will lose us stated 

00:05:49.029 --> 00:05:50.860
 more of this good will not 

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:52.889
 in general, we got to the area 

00:05:52.889 --> 00:05:54.129
 tested 

00:05:54.129 --> 00:05:57.409
 but such a skirt is a wonderful box office 

00:05:57.409 --> 00:05:58.749
 in our 

00:05:58.749 --> 00:06:00.559
 in the smartphone 

00:06:00.559 --> 00:06:03.089
 at 58 00 thank you all 

00:06:03.089 --> 00:06:05.789
 Goodbye interest is due 

00:06:05.789 --> 00:06:06.479
