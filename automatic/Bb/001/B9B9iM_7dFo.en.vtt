00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:39.820
 the bottle 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:42.510

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:09.169
 his family 

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:11.939
 the couple so the apple in small pieces 

00:02:11.939 --> 00:02:13.399
 by removing the skin 

00:02:13.399 --> 00:02:15.559
 we like it soaked in the bottle 

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:18.949
