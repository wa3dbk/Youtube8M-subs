00:01:34.059 --> 00:01:34.069 
the now I normally tell people that

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:35.740 
the now I normally tell people that
there<00:01:34.220> is<00:01:34.369> no<00:01:34.670> correct<00:01:35.060> way<00:01:35.209> of<00:01:35.539> doing

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:35.750 
there is no correct way of doing

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:39.160 
there is no correct way of doing
anything<00:01:35.989> in<00:01:36.229> Tarot<00:01:36.500> however<00:01:36.979> this<00:01:37.970> is<00:01:38.690> one

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:39.170 
anything in Tarot however this is one

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:42.370 
anything in Tarot however this is one
thing<00:01:39.470> I<00:01:39.709> really<00:01:40.310> emphasize<00:01:40.610> and<00:01:41.360> believe<00:01:41.660> to

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:42.380 
thing I really emphasize and believe to

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:45.460 
thing I really emphasize and believe to
be<00:01:42.670> something<00:01:43.670> to<00:01:44.239> be<00:01:44.360> there<00:01:44.840> is<00:01:44.989> a<00:01:45.020> correct

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:45.470 
be something to be there is a correct

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:48.520 
be something to be there is a correct
way<00:01:45.649> to<00:01:45.679> do<00:01:46.149> flipping<00:01:47.149> your<00:01:47.270> cards<00:01:47.690> in<00:01:48.289> my

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:48.530 
way to do flipping your cards in my

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:50.109 
way to do flipping your cards in my
opinion<00:01:49.009> there<00:01:49.190> is<00:01:49.220> a<00:01:49.340> correct<00:01:49.670> rate<00:01:49.880> and

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:50.119 
opinion there is a correct rate and

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:54.130 
opinion there is a correct rate and
there<00:01:50.300> is<00:01:50.420> a<00:01:50.450> wrong<00:01:50.899> way<00:01:51.459> and<00:01:52.539> the<00:01:53.539> correct<00:01:53.899> way

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:54.140 
there is a wrong way and the correct way

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:56.830 
there is a wrong way and the correct way
which<00:01:54.679> I<00:01:54.860> teach<00:01:54.940> readers<00:01:55.940> is<00:01:56.149> to<00:01:56.479> flip<00:01:56.720> your

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:56.840 
which I teach readers is to flip your

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:02.290 
which I teach readers is to flip your
cards<00:01:57.369> from<00:01:58.369> left<00:01:58.700> to<00:01:58.910> right<00:02:00.130> and<00:02:01.130> not<00:02:01.520> from

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:02.300 
cards from left to right and not from

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:06.100 
cards from left to right and not from
bottom<00:02:02.690> to<00:02:02.959> up<00:02:04.450> the<00:02:05.450> reason<00:02:05.780> for<00:02:05.929> this<00:02:06.050> is

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:06.110 
bottom to up the reason for this is

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:08.529 
bottom to up the reason for this is
because<00:02:06.379> when<00:02:07.039> you<00:02:07.129> flip<00:02:07.369> from<00:02:07.970> left<00:02:08.179> to<00:02:08.270> right

00:02:08.529 --> 00:02:08.539 
because when you flip from left to right

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:11.410 
because when you flip from left to right
it<00:02:08.780> preserves<00:02:09.289> the<00:02:09.470> original<00:02:10.120> orientation<00:02:11.120> of

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.420 
it preserves the original orientation of

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:13.930

in<00:02:21.960> this<00:02:22.080> deck<00:02:22.350> I<00:02:22.620> have<00:02:23.069> the<00:02:23.490> first<00:02:23.700> three

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
in this deck I have the first three

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:25.880 
in this deck I have the first three
cards<00:02:24.270> one<00:02:24.900> of<00:02:24.930> the<00:02:25.080> cards<00:02:25.350> in<00:02:25.470> there<00:02:25.650> is

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:27.980 
cards one of the cards in there is
reversed<00:02:26.640> now<00:02:26.880> let<00:02:27.120> me<00:02:27.180> show<00:02:27.360> you<00:02:27.390> if<00:02:27.750> your

reversed now let me show you if your

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:29.900 
reversed now let me show you if your
reader<00:02:28.230> uses<00:02:28.620> reversals<00:02:29.130> how<00:02:29.250> important<00:02:29.790> it

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
reader uses reversals how important it

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:32.809

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:39.650 
flip over the next card left to right
it's<00:02:37.200> reversed<00:02:37.620> and<00:02:38.090> I<00:02:39.090> flip<00:02:39.300> over<00:02:39.390> the<00:02:39.510> last

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660 
it's reversed and I flip over the last

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:42.590 
it's reversed and I flip over the last
one<00:02:39.900> and<00:02:40.080> it<00:02:40.200> is<00:02:40.230> upright<00:02:41.300> flipping<00:02:42.300> left<00:02:42.480> to

reversed

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
reversed

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:53.360 
reversed
up<00:02:48.390> right<00:02:49.010> now<00:02:50.010> putting<00:02:50.970> the<00:02:51.510> cards<00:02:51.900> back<00:02:52.370> into

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
up right now putting the cards back into

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:58.970 
up right now putting the cards back into
the<00:02:53.700> pile<00:02:53.970> and<00:02:54.300> flipping<00:02:55.140> from<00:02:56.360> bottom<00:02:57.360> up<00:02:57.980> you

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
the pile and flipping from bottom up you

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:01.460 
the pile and flipping from bottom up you
get<00:02:59.220> the<00:02:59.670> opposite<00:03:00.180> result<00:03:00.690> you're<00:03:00.989> actually

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
get the opposite result you're actually

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:04.460 
get the opposite result you're actually
inverting<00:03:02.430> the<00:03:02.790> original<00:03:03.390> orientation<00:03:04.050> of<00:03:04.350> a

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470 
inverting the original orientation of a

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:10.130 
inverting the original orientation of a
card<00:03:04.860> like<00:03:06.110> so<00:03:07.910> so<00:03:08.910> now<00:03:09.060> you<00:03:09.120> have<00:03:09.330> a<00:03:09.510> reverse

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140 
card like so so now you have a reverse

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:12.770 
card like so so now you have a reverse
upright<00:03:10.650> reversed<00:03:11.070> even<00:03:12.030> though<00:03:12.150> these<00:03:12.480> are

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
upright reversed even though these are

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:16.729 
upright reversed even though these are
the<00:03:13.080> same<00:03:13.290> cards<00:03:14.780> so<00:03:15.780> no<00:03:15.930> matter<00:03:16.230> how<00:03:16.320> you<00:03:16.500> flip

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:16.739 
the same cards so no matter how you flip

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:18.500 
the same cards so no matter how you flip
the<00:03:16.860> cards<00:03:17.220> you'll<00:03:17.400> get<00:03:17.850> the<00:03:17.970> same<00:03:18.120> cards

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510 
the cards you'll get the same cards

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:22.070 
the cards you'll get the same cards
obviously<00:03:19.459> but<00:03:20.459> the<00:03:20.640> but<00:03:21.150> the<00:03:21.180> meaning<00:03:21.870> has

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:22.080 
obviously but the but the meaning has

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:25.250 
obviously but the but the meaning has
changed<00:03:22.110> because<00:03:22.920> now<00:03:23.720> instead<00:03:24.720> of<00:03:25.049> having

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
changed because now instead of having

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.069 
changed because now instead of having
one<00:03:26.070> reversal<00:03:26.459> and<00:03:26.940> two<00:03:27.239> uprights<00:03:27.720> you<00:03:27.930> have

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:28.079 
one reversal and two uprights you have

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:30.470 
one reversal and two uprights you have
two<00:03:28.290> reversals<00:03:28.890> and<00:03:29.220> one<00:03:29.850> upright<00:03:30.269> and

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:30.480 
two reversals and one upright and

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:33.590 
two reversals and one upright and
depending<00:03:31.049> on<00:03:31.110> how<00:03:31.290> you<00:03:31.350> read<00:03:31.860> reversals<00:03:32.600> we

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:33.600 
depending on how you read reversals we

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:36.560 
depending on how you read reversals we
really<00:03:33.870> have<00:03:34.680> an<00:03:34.769> impact<00:03:34.980> on<00:03:35.430> the<00:03:35.910> message<00:03:36.329> of

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:36.570 
really have an impact on the message of

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:39.020 
really have an impact on the message of
the<00:03:36.930> cards<00:03:37.380> depend<00:03:38.040> you<00:03:38.130> know<00:03:38.250> it<00:03:38.489> depending

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.030 
the cards depend you know it depending

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:41.120 
the cards depend you know it depending
on<00:03:39.090> how<00:03:39.239> your<00:03:39.390> reversals<00:03:39.989> it'll<00:03:40.290> really<00:03:40.920> have

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:41.130 
on how your reversals it'll really have

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:43.610 
on how your reversals it'll really have
an<00:03:41.459> impact<00:03:41.970> and<00:03:42.360> influence<00:03:42.510> on<00:03:42.930> how<00:03:43.079> the<00:03:43.140> cards

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620 
an impact and influence on how the cards

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:46.130 
an impact and influence on how the cards
are<00:03:43.769> red<00:03:43.920> because<00:03:44.280> this<00:03:44.970> reading<00:03:45.540> is<00:03:45.720> very

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:46.140 
are red because this reading is very

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:50.780 
are red because this reading is very
different<00:03:46.769> from<00:03:48.440> this<00:03:49.440> reading<00:03:49.799> these<00:03:50.610> are

different from this reading these are

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:52.490 
different from this reading these are
two<00:03:51.090> different<00:03:51.540> readings<00:03:51.870> there<00:03:52.200> might<00:03:52.350> be<00:03:52.380> a

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:52.500 
two different readings there might be a

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:55.039 
two different readings there might be a
similar<00:03:52.829> message<00:03:53.100> there<00:03:53.610> but<00:03:54.390> the<00:03:54.720> way<00:03:54.870> the

00:03:55.039 --> 00:03:55.049 
similar message there but the way the

00:03:55.049 --> 00:03:56.810 
similar message there but the way the
message<00:03:55.200> will<00:03:55.470> be<00:03:55.500> delivered<00:03:55.709> and<00:03:56.310> this<00:03:56.549> in

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:56.820 
message will be delivered and this in

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:58.940 
message will be delivered and this in
the<00:03:56.970> details<00:03:57.420> will<00:03:57.870> be<00:03:57.900> different<00:03:58.410> depending

00:03:58.940 --> 00:03:58.950 
the details will be different depending

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:02.990 
the details will be different depending
on<00:03:59.070> how<00:03:59.160> you<00:03:59.220> reversals<00:04:00.060> so<00:04:01.670> how<00:04:02.670> to<00:04:02.730> flick

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:03.000 
on how you reversals so how to flick

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.360 
on how you reversals so how to flick
your<00:04:03.030> cards<00:04:03.630> you<00:04:04.019> know<00:04:04.140> there<00:04:04.410> -<00:04:04.920> like<00:04:05.190> I<00:04:05.310> said

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:05.370 
your cards you know there - like I said

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:07.190 
your cards you know there - like I said
to<00:04:05.700> me<00:04:05.730> there<00:04:06.060> is<00:04:06.209> a<00:04:06.239> right<00:04:06.570> way<00:04:06.600> there<00:04:07.019> is<00:04:07.170> a

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:07.200 
to me there is a right way there is a

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:09.710 
to me there is a right way there is a
wrong<00:04:07.500> way<00:04:07.739> I<00:04:07.980> truly<00:04:08.700> believe<00:04:09.000> that<00:04:09.030> the<00:04:09.510> right

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:09.720 
wrong way I truly believe that the right

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:12.620 
wrong way I truly believe that the right
way<00:04:09.959> to<00:04:09.989> flip<00:04:10.500> your<00:04:10.620> cards<00:04:10.980> is<00:04:11.130> left<00:04:11.670> to<00:04:12.360> right

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:12.630 
way to flip your cards is left to right

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:15.259 
way to flip your cards is left to right
like<00:04:13.049> so<00:04:13.320> you<00:04:13.380> want<00:04:13.620> to<00:04:13.709> flip<00:04:13.920> it<00:04:13.980> over<00:04:14.220> like<00:04:15.209> a

00:04:15.259 --> 00:04:15.269 
like so you want to flip it over like a

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:18.529 
like so you want to flip it over like a
page<00:04:15.570> in<00:04:15.780> a<00:04:15.870> book<00:04:16.190> to<00:04:17.190> keep<00:04:17.430> the<00:04:17.609> correct

00:04:18.529 --> 00:04:18.539 
page in a book to keep the correct
