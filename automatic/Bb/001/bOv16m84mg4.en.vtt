00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:03.810
 vÃ¡zquez 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:09.660
 the ones in all 

00:00:10.659 --> 00:00:15.539
 ten means to a new evaluation in motor time today we are testing the 

00:00:15.539 --> 00:00:18.659
 new bmw x3 

00:00:18.659 --> 00:00:21.659
 I 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:28.670
 the most compact version of eta to relatives by utility that has the 

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:33.620
 German brand a model that began to be understood in the old continent towards 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:34.120
 the East 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:38.059
 always from last year and that very few days ago landed on the 

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:42.860
 argentina with three versions an entry-level version only 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:49.579
 contraction 4 by 200 four-four versions an automotive says that the 

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:54.800
 We are testing ourselves equipped with two liters of 177 horses 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.550
 and another third a top of range as 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:00.550
 nac 2003 

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:09.390
 like the whole ass with four-wheel drive is very important to know 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.450
 how the system has worked the mechanism of transmission 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:17.430
 in the case that insurance has a central office in Montevideo with the differential 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.560
 central that is distributing the force of the engine between the front and rear axle 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:26.500
 as necessary and since the differential between 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:31.210
 and back uses the abc system and stability control to detect 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:31.570
 patterns 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:32.369
 guidelines 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:35.369
 them sending force to the wheel that does have 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:48.070
 doors inside is more like the bus still earns a relative 

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:53.680
 spondilitis france for its driving position is much lower than the 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:56.840
 People will meet any vehicle crossover porn 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:02.020
 as for the equipment we noted some missing conspiracy as 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:02.939
 for example 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:05.270
 they do not have cruise control 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:09.280
 does not have a body because it looks like to increase the capacity of the team 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:12.280
 music does not have heating on the board either 

00:02:13.179 --> 00:02:16.260
 wb starting d the ice fear 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:17.809
 and throughout its range of 

00:02:17.809 --> 00:02:22.279
 2010 is incorporating as an optional equipment 

00:02:22.279 --> 00:02:25.999
 the satellite navigator for the first time in our country 

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:41.959
 by the side of the engine although we have 177 horses is 6 2 liters the truth 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:45.969
 is that the assertions are quite moderate and progressive 

00:02:45.969 --> 00:02:50.839
 the main thing that we reject as a major benefit of this engine is the 

00:02:50.839 --> 00:02:52.460
 consumption really 

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:55.099
 very but very low we are talking 

00:02:55.099 --> 00:03:01.080
 in the future d the city that is brewing a maximum of 11 liters per 100 

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:07.019
 when you go to the route at 130 kilometers per hour in sixth gear, it does not go beyond 

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:09.979
 seven 7 liters and a half every 100 

00:03:09.979 --> 00:03:14.319
 well this way we come to the end of a new evaluation the motor time you 

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:16.089
 I remember that the power 

00:03:16.089 --> 00:03:18.239
 the complete note 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:21.239
 triple double point time engine point 

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:24.220
 that way we said goodbye we found the next phase
