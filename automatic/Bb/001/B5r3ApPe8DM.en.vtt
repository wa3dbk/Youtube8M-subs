fence now this doesn't actually use

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:11.390 
fence now this doesn't actually use
electricity<00:00:08.730> but<00:00:09.690> it's<00:00:09.840> pretty<00:00:10.019> cool<00:00:10.290> so<00:00:11.099> i'm

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 
electricity but it's pretty cool so i'm

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:18.019 
going to show you the effect it has
whenever<00:00:14.400> I<00:00:14.519> walk<00:00:14.849> through<00:00:15.120> it<00:00:16.970> okay<00:00:17.970> so

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
whenever I walk through it okay so

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:19.820 
whenever I walk through it okay so
basically<00:00:18.300> I<00:00:18.480> walk<00:00:18.630> through<00:00:18.810> it<00:00:18.960> and<00:00:19.289> it<00:00:19.650> kills

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
basically I walk through it and it kills

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.200 
basically I walk through it and it kills
me<00:00:20.010> now<00:00:20.789> as<00:00:20.939> you<00:00:21.090> can<00:00:21.180> see<00:00:21.240> it<00:00:22.170> says<00:00:22.410> given

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:23.210 
me now as you can see it says given

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:27.529 
me now as you can see it says given
instant<00:00:24.210> damage<00:00:24.449> ID<00:00:25.039> seven<00:00:26.039> times<00:00:26.400> three<00:00:26.670> four

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
instant damage ID seven times three four

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.330 
instant damage ID seven times three four
ten<00:00:27.660> seconds<00:00:28.080> and<00:00:28.619> I'll<00:00:28.769> explain<00:00:29.099> that<00:00:29.279> a

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
ten seconds and I'll explain that a

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.799 
ten seconds and I'll explain that a
little<00:00:29.429> bit<00:00:29.789> but<00:00:30.390> basically<00:00:32.270> you<00:00:33.270> can<00:00:33.480> make<00:00:33.510> it

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
little bit but basically you can make it

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.920 
little bit but basically you can make it
as<00:00:33.989> high<00:00:34.200> as<00:00:34.380> you<00:00:34.530> want<00:00:34.559> to<00:00:35.540> you<00:00:36.540> can<00:00:36.690> make<00:00:36.780> it

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
as high as you want to you can make it

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.979 
as high as you want to you can make it
as<00:00:37.020> wide<00:00:37.200> as<00:00:37.230> you<00:00:37.440> want<00:00:37.559> to<00:00:38.450> but<00:00:39.450> I<00:00:39.660> basically

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
as wide as you want to but I basically

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.319 
as wide as you want to but I basically
just<00:00:40.079> did<00:00:40.440> a<00:00:40.469> three<00:00:41.129> block<00:00:41.309> wide<00:00:41.579> one<00:00:42.090> block

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
just did a three block wide one block

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:45.170 
just did a three block wide one block
having<00:00:42.570> the<00:00:42.780> wire<00:00:42.989> and<00:00:43.320> then<00:00:44.129> three<00:00:44.910> blocks

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
having the wire and then three blocks

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.630 
having the wire and then three blocks
wide<00:00:45.450> and<00:00:45.950> one<00:00:46.950> o'clock

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
wide and one o'clock

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.750 
wide and one o'clock
having<00:00:48.059> the<00:00:48.149> wire<00:00:48.500> so<00:00:49.500> this<00:00:49.890> is<00:00:50.100> the<00:00:50.340> command

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
having the wire so this is the command

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.990 
having the wire so this is the command
that<00:00:51.030> it<00:00:51.840> uses<00:00:52.050> the<00:00:53.039> command<00:00:53.370> it<00:00:53.489> uses<00:00:53.789> is

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
that it uses the command it uses is

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.450 
that it uses the command it uses is
slash<00:00:54.329> effect<00:00:54.780> at<00:00:56.059> p7<00:00:57.059> ten<00:00:57.480> three<00:00:58.309> now<00:00:59.309> this

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
slash effect at p7 ten three now this

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.099 
slash effect at p7 ten three now this
might<00:00:59.640> be<00:00:59.670> just<00:01:00.149> a<00:01:00.300> whole<00:01:00.449> bunch<00:01:00.629> of<00:01:00.750> gibberish

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
might be just a whole bunch of gibberish

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.349 
might be just a whole bunch of gibberish
to<00:01:01.500> you<00:01:01.680> so<00:01:02.460> I'm<00:01:02.550> gonna<00:01:02.699> explain<00:01:02.820> it

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
to you so I'm gonna explain it

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:06.560 
to you so I'm gonna explain it
/e<00:01:03.960> effect<00:01:04.409> is<00:01:04.619> the<00:01:04.890> command<00:01:05.369> to<00:01:06.030> put<00:01:06.299> on

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
/e effect is the command to put on

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.250 
/e effect is the command to put on
potion<00:01:07.409> effects<00:01:07.850> now<00:01:08.850> a<00:01:08.880> slash<00:01:09.240> effect<00:01:09.630> or<00:01:09.840> a

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
potion effects now a slash effect or a

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.760 
potion effects now a slash effect or a
set<00:01:11.070> of<00:01:11.100> potion<00:01:11.670> effects<00:01:11.939> at<00:01:12.600> P<00:01:13.049> to<00:01:13.619> the

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
set of potion effects at P to the

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.080 
set of potion effects at P to the
nearest<00:01:14.070> player<00:01:15.020> 7<00:01:16.020> which<00:01:16.830> is<00:01:16.860> the<00:01:17.549> potion

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
nearest player 7 which is the potion

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:23.030 
nearest player 7 which is the potion
effect<00:01:18.540> ID<00:01:19.400> ten<00:01:20.400> is<00:01:20.670> the<00:01:20.720> time<00:01:21.720> it<00:01:21.900> lasts<00:01:22.140> so<00:01:23.009> I

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
effect ID ten is the time it lasts so I

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.010 
effect ID ten is the time it lasts so I
guess<00:01:23.369> I<00:01:23.610> guess<00:01:23.970> in<00:01:24.180> case<00:01:24.360> if<00:01:24.570> you<00:01:24.689> don't<00:01:24.810> want

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
guess I guess in case if you don't want

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.530 
guess I guess in case if you don't want
them<00:01:25.170> to<00:01:25.380> if<00:01:26.040> you<00:01:26.520> want<00:01:26.700> them<00:01:26.880> to<00:01:26.909> make<00:01:27.240> if<00:01:27.420> you

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
them to if you want them to make if you

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.450 
them to if you want them to make if you
want<00:01:27.720> to<00:01:27.840> make<00:01:27.960> sure<00:01:27.990> that<00:01:28.500> they're<00:01:28.650> dead<00:01:28.860> you

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
want to make sure that they're dead you

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.730 
want to make sure that they're dead you
can<00:01:29.640> put<00:01:29.820> a<00:01:29.850> high<00:01:30.030> number<00:01:30.090> and<00:01:30.570> then<00:01:31.079> three<00:01:31.500> is

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
can put a high number and then three is

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.160 
can put a high number and then three is
the<00:01:31.979> degree<00:01:32.549> that<00:01:33.119> the<00:01:33.360> potion<00:01:33.720> effect<00:01:33.930> is<00:01:34.079> on

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
the degree that the potion effect is on

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.140 
the degree that the potion effect is on
so<00:01:34.439> three<00:01:34.740> is<00:01:34.860> how<00:01:35.040> strong<00:01:35.369> the<00:01:35.579> potion<00:01:35.880> effect

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
so three is how strong the potion effect

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.819 
so three is how strong the potion effect
is<00:01:37.460> so<00:01:38.460> this<00:01:38.729> said<00:01:38.970> I'm<00:01:39.180> gonna<00:01:39.329> show<00:01:39.600> you

00:01:39.819 --> 00:01:39.829 
is so this said I'm gonna show you

00:01:39.829 --> 00:01:43.039 
is so this said I'm gonna show you
basically<00:01:40.829> how<00:01:41.159> I<00:01:41.189> just<00:01:41.490> build<00:01:41.790> these<00:01:41.970> I<00:01:42.360> just

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
basically how I just build these I just

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:46.340 
basically how I just build these I just
basically<00:01:43.229> did<00:01:43.590> three<00:01:44.460> structure<00:01:44.880> and<00:01:45.270> had<00:01:45.509> to

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
basically did three structure and had to

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:47.149 
basically did three structure and had to
command<00:01:46.740> blocks

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
command blocks

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.130 
command blocks
whenever<00:01:47.909> somebody<00:01:48.090> walks<00:01:48.390> through<00:01:48.509> it<00:01:48.810> pulls

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
whenever somebody walks through it pulls

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.969 
whenever somebody walks through it pulls
and<00:01:49.500> hits<00:01:50.430> that<00:01:50.700> and<00:01:51.470> same<00:01:52.470> thing<00:01:52.680> for<00:01:52.860> over

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
and hits that and same thing for over

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:56.270 
and hits that and same thing for over
here<00:01:53.250> and<00:01:53.960> then<00:01:54.960> over<00:01:55.170> here<00:01:55.320> I<00:01:55.590> just<00:01:55.680> have<00:01:55.979> one

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
here and then over here I just have one

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.289 
here and then over here I just have one
block<00:01:56.520> now<00:01:57.360> there<00:01:57.570> are<00:01:57.750> some<00:01:58.140> um<00:01:59.270> there<00:02:00.270> are

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
block now there are some um there are

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:03.649 
block now there are some um there are
some<00:02:00.420> issues<00:02:00.750> with<00:02:01.560> this<00:02:01.740> method<00:02:02.420> let's<00:02:03.420> say

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
some issues with this method let's say

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:06.469 
some issues with this method let's say
it<00:02:04.409> your<00:02:04.860> the<00:02:04.890> area<00:02:05.520> that<00:02:05.759> you<00:02:05.909> put<00:02:06.119> this<00:02:06.240> in

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
it your the area that you put this in

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:09.680 
it your the area that you put this in
needs<00:02:06.840> to<00:02:07.049> be<00:02:07.229> tightly<00:02:07.890> secured<00:02:08.459> it<00:02:09.119> doesn't

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
needs to be tightly secured it doesn't

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:10.430
