 You see this type of coloring under 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:10.500
 gray tips gray tint we see 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:12.630
 completely gray hair well just and and you 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:16.610
 can you imagine and believe 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:18.450
 that grandmothers are becoming fashionable and 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:21.540
 accordingly, if you suddenly have 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:24.570
 gray hair why did you repaint them 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:26.939
 but why do you suffer there now 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:30.240
 she was honestly shocked 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:32.490
 when I saw the guys and I certainly noticed 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.820
 some celebrities with strange 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.200
 hair color and noticed some 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:39.590
 strange 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:41.659
 on the streets of the city trends but not until 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:44.929
 the same degree for everything 

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:46.549
 started handsome gray and look in 

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:48.380
 depending on your hair color 

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:49.399
 natural dependence on your 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:52.280
 skin tone 

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:56.179
 girls pick themselves different shade 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:58.429
 gray hair there for example you see white 

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:59.960
 so cold the rest is gray 

00:01:58.429 --> 00:02:02.990
 shade but this is if you originally 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:05.630
 ash blonde or just ruses or 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:09.709
 such bright blonde some hair 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:11.480
 here is an example of such luck white 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:13.360
 I am most likely this girl or Russo 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:16.069
 either the blonde was originally 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:18.560
 repainted here see what you live 

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:20.900
 the roots are dark and go where you 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:24.620
 see this is not blonde this is exactly gray 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:28.640
 steel this metallic gray 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:30.590
 I like this trend madly like 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:33.290
 just really like but firstly 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:33.950
 because women and grandmothers can be 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:36.319
 fashionable 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:39.709
 we think in addition to the young man so to speak 

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:42.410
 serious such a shade of hair perfectly 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:44.750
 universal ie hair as it were 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:46.609
 becomes neutral components 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:48.709
 looks but very bright 

00:02:46.609 --> 00:02:51.139
 simultaneously neutral at the same time 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:52.880
 bright neutral because you now 

00:02:51.139 --> 00:02:55.160
 no need to pick up under 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:57.769
 red hair color or dark color 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:59.959
 hair some shades under the metal 

00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:03.230
 under this gray hair color fits 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:05.359
 absolutely any gamma it could be 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:07.730
 dark light purple shades this 

00:03:05.359 --> 00:03:10.790
 yellow and blue roses well, in general, all that 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:12.889
 pleases and well agree not 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:15.079
 just some blonde namely here 

00:03:12.889 --> 00:03:17.510
 what is in this ball what is 

00:03:15.079 --> 00:03:19.459
 in this chic certain not fucking 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:22.600
 like here look yes for example and 

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:25.630
 black hair and after 

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:27.090
 not steeper a thousand times than just paint 

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:30.180
 in some gray 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:33.760
 chestnut or just blonde 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:36.520
 I did not make up my mind on this one hundred percent sure I 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:38.830
 I will not be painted over here but 

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:41.410

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:43.300
