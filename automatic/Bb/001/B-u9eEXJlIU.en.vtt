designs and stairs are actually now have
a<00:01:23.610> corner<00:01:24.090> piece<00:01:24.420> which<00:01:24.930> makes<00:01:25.200> the<00:01:25.380> flowing<00:01:25.860> a

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
a corner piece which makes the flowing a

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.429 
a corner piece which makes the flowing a
pattern<00:01:26.520> of<00:01:26.640> corner<00:01:27.240> stairs<00:01:27.509> be<00:01:27.960> very<00:01:28.259> much

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
pattern of corner stairs be very much

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.469 
pattern of corner stairs be very much
more<00:01:28.680> fluid<00:01:28.920> and<00:01:29.130> more<00:01:29.280> design<00:01:29.939> appealing

blocks<00:02:08.340> a<00:02:08.910> good<00:02:09.479> feature<00:02:09.690> another<00:02:10.200> another

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
blocks a good feature another another

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:12.530 
blocks a good feature another another
good<00:02:11.310> design<00:02:11.580> feature<00:02:11.849> I<00:02:11.940> think<00:02:12.180> feel<00:02:12.390> like

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
good design feature I think feel like

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:13.760 
good design feature I think feel like
this<00:02:12.690> updates<00:02:12.989> gonna<00:02:13.140> be<00:02:13.260> really<00:02:13.470> good

this updates gonna be really good

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.340 
this updates gonna be really good
for<00:02:14.400> designing<00:02:14.670> purposes<00:02:15.240> one<00:02:16.050> of<00:02:16.170> the<00:02:16.230> big

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:16.350 
for designing purposes one of the big

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:17.780 
for designing purposes one of the big
features<00:02:16.500> is<00:02:16.740> going<00:02:16.860> to<00:02:16.920> be<00:02:16.980> iron<00:02:17.220> golems<00:02:17.550> most

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
features is going to be iron golems most

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:19.100 
features is going to be iron golems most
people<00:02:18.000> know<00:02:18.030> how<00:02:18.210> to<00:02:18.270> make<00:02:18.390> an<00:02:18.540> iron<00:02:18.720> golem<00:02:18.870> as

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
people know how to make an iron golem as

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:20.330 
people know how to make an iron golem as
I<00:02:19.200> show<00:02:19.410> right<00:02:19.590> here<00:02:19.800> that<00:02:19.950> can<00:02:20.070> be<00:02:20.160> made<00:02:20.310> with

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
I show right here that can be made with

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.910 
I show right here that can be made with
a<00:02:20.460> Jack<00:02:20.730> O'Lantern<00:02:20.760> or<00:02:21.240> pumpkin<00:02:21.710> good<00:02:22.710> for

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
a Jack O'Lantern or pumpkin good for

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:24.830 
a Jack O'Lantern or pumpkin good for
defense<00:02:23.190> they<00:02:23.430> attack<00:02:23.730> any<00:02:23.760> mobs<00:02:24.210> I<00:02:24.480> believe

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
defense they attack any mobs I believe

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:26.690 
defense they attack any mobs I believe
they<00:02:24.960> don't<00:02:25.080> attack<00:02:25.380> creepers<00:02:25.800> though<00:02:25.980> but

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
they don't attack creepers though but

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:28.190 
they don't attack creepers though but
that's<00:02:26.850> why<00:02:26.970> you<00:02:27.000> need<00:02:27.180> ocelots<00:02:27.540> man<00:02:27.750> I<00:02:27.930> slots

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
that's why you need ocelots man I slots

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.440 
that's why you need ocelots man I slots
drive<00:02:28.440> away<00:02:28.650> creepers<00:02:28.860> but<00:02:29.820> yeah<00:02:30.030> a<00:02:30.180> great

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
drive away creepers but yeah a great

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:31.940 
drive away creepers but yeah a great
defense<00:02:30.720> mechanism<00:02:31.290> and<00:02:31.440> they<00:02:31.620> can<00:02:31.800> withstand

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
defense mechanism and they can withstand

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:36.260 
defense mechanism and they can withstand
a<00:02:32.400> lot<00:02:32.850> of<00:02:33.120> damage<00:02:33.830> also<00:02:34.830> moving<00:02:35.100> on<00:02:35.370> 3d<00:02:35.880> items

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:36.270 
a lot of damage also moving on 3d items

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:37.790 
a lot of damage also moving on 3d items
this<00:02:36.600> was<00:02:36.750> shown<00:02:36.870> in<00:02:37.020> the<00:02:37.080> latest<00:02:37.380> screenshot

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:37.800
