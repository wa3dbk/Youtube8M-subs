00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:23.999
 when we talk about indoor chronology we are talking about a branch that is perhaps not much 

00:00:23.999 --> 00:00:28.519
 known of the medicine yet also our thyroid for example is part 

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:33.780
 of the endocrine system of tt indo chronology we go into this episode of 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.809
 trentino + salute we are going to hear doctor dematte 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.380
 doctor of matteo first of all what is lindo criminologia 

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:47.160
 endocrinology 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.550
 it is a branch of medicine that is very interesting 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:56.870
 l also motor scooter eh which deals with the insurance glands in 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:00.240
 terrace to those plants distributed in our body 

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:05.460
 which produce substances called hormones directly pour into the 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:10.370
 blood circulation therefore have a capacity to relate to all 

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:15.160
 organs of our body and endocrinology and therefore a science is 

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:20.160
 truly transversal and very perhaps she is the most international bank that we 

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:21.290
 we can know 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:24.690
 which are lady diana don't let the system endocrine 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:28.880
 these glands are me what we call the mother organ is pituitary 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:32.280
 located in the saddle turcica then inside the skull 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.850
 from which the defendants depart for the control of the other glands that are 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:38.530
 adrenal thyroid 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:43.560
 the gonads if in the breast your important action also reset 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.140
 on the bear 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:46.910
 these are the main ones 

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:48.690
 the problems that can arise 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:50.420
 Pellegatti 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:52.490
 studying endocrine which can be 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:56.259
 related problems and dysfunctions of the endocrine glands can be 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:58.950
 due 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:04.380
 lard to make hormone business or to sex and hormones and therefore we will talk for 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.600
 every organ today combined stories a bit function 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:09.039
 and these glands 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:12.289
 doctor when we talk about endocrinology we often talk about it 

00:02:12.289 --> 00:02:14.939
 thyroid what can we say about that 

00:02:14.939 --> 00:02:18.369
 pension the most known daphne gland because it is widespread 

00:02:18.369 --> 00:02:19.689
 thyroid pathology 

00:02:19.689 --> 00:02:24.900
 eeeh it is considered that about 20% of the general population sooner or later has 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:29.529
 had a thyroid problem about thyroid disease what are the pathologies 

00:02:29.529 --> 00:02:31.979
 problems can be hit 

00:02:31.979 --> 00:02:35.929
 sometimes the thyroid may not work perfectly and therefore can produce 

00:02:35.929 --> 00:02:37.869
 oldies letter in a circle 

00:02:37.869 --> 00:02:41.089
 too little hormone thyrotropic hormone 

00:02:41.089 --> 00:02:43.680
 for the daily pathology for punishment that laughs 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:48.299
 yeah it's called hyperthyroidism and in this case hotel laris symptoms 

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:53.569
 hyperthyroidism is weight loss, tachycardia, the word nissa monia la 

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:56.569
 sweating intolerance to heat 

00:02:57.599 --> 00:02:59.470
 the symptoms of hypothyroidism 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:05.020
 are fatigue is the classification of the skin bradycardia la 

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:08.839
 tendency to callara to retain liquids and therefore weight gain 

00:03:08.839 --> 00:03:12.869
 there are two very delicate situations concerning none hypothyroidism 

00:03:12.869 --> 00:03:13.919
 pregnancy 

00:03:13.919 --> 00:03:19.389
 - old age because in pregnancy the hormonal deficiency can 

00:03:19.389 --> 00:03:24.589
 determine a defect of intellectual development and also the physical of the roof 

00:03:24.589 --> 00:03:29.609
 and because in the elderly clearly hypothyroidism can worsen the skin 

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:33.659
 autonomy to reduce the autonomy of the elderly in the treatment of diseases 

00:03:33.659 --> 00:03:38.430
 thyroid and fortunately very simple I would say that thyroid matter 

00:03:38.429 --> 00:03:43.309
 I can easily be diagnosed if you think about it and it's easily treatable with gods 

00:03:43.309 --> 00:03:49.749
 Medicines must be well tolerated, so I have a low cost and therefore a very simple form 

00:03:50.639 --> 00:03:55.139
 one of the problems related to our thyroid is the course particularly 

00:03:55.139 --> 00:04:00.079
 widespread in the territories of the Alpine arc but what exactly is it 

00:04:00.079 --> 00:04:01.849
 explains the sniper doctor 

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:06.099
 shop ostuni mare result of the increase in volume of the gland 

00:04:06.099 --> 00:04:07.039
 thyroid 

00:04:07.039 --> 00:04:11.119
 in the initial stages of ultimum the only symptom of the disease is given precisely 

00:04:11.119 --> 00:04:13.699
 from this simple swelling of the gland 

00:04:13.699 --> 00:04:17.500
 determined similarly to a reduction in hormone production 

00:04:17.499 --> 00:04:18.370
 thyroid 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:21.259
 that stimulate interpretation of a substance 

00:04:21.259 --> 00:04:24.259
 handle pituitary leading product hello 

00:04:25.499 --> 00:04:29.349
 and at a later stage it is possible that nodules may form 

00:04:29.349 --> 00:04:33.449
 and that there is either the development of persecution because it is angular 

00:04:33.449 --> 00:04:34.710
 doctor heart 

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:38.189
 the first area cause that determines the face 

00:04:38.189 --> 00:04:39.490
 are the primary causes 

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:43.250
 in the development of cost worldwide iodine deficiency deficiency of 

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:46.439
 iodine expo vertical feeding in the waters 

00:04:46.439 --> 00:04:51.499
 in some caressed areas so accent the potato let you talk about yourself to limit the 

00:04:51.499 --> 00:04:53.330
 goiter an endemic disease 

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:57.500
 in Italy there are about 6 million people with specimens 

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:58.520
 thyroid 

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:03.500
 for which this is about 10% periodically 10% of the population 

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:05.389
 so we can well say that Italy 

00:05:05.389 --> 00:05:08.300
 it is a bonus area for goats 

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:13.139
 therefore, a precious friend of our thyroid hello iorio we feel that role 

00:05:13.139 --> 00:05:15.539
 carries out and how we can take it 

00:05:15.539 --> 00:05:19.189
 ah prophylaxis we say so consistent very simple measures that 

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:20.500
 m 

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:23.639
 the fate given intake of deodated salt 

00:05:23.639 --> 00:05:28.280
 practically salt iodized salt fortified with 30 years of great li 

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:34.970
 hate claw the salt &amp; disappointed face of this would have been verified - i 

00:05:34.969 --> 00:05:37.349
 Scandinavian states our expert 

00:05:37.349 --> 00:05:40.110
 moreover it is important to remember the importance 

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:44.850
 of the assumption of this the true substance except of the pregnancy 

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:48.530
 because so much pregnancy cyan greater demand on further party 

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:50.020
 eye needs
