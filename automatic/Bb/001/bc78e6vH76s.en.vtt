00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:18.330 
right now I'm editing the part where I

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:21.050 
right now I'm editing the part where I
was<00:06:18.870> filming<00:06:19.680> myself<00:06:19.889> sleeping<00:06:20.610> last<00:06:20.850> night

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:21.060 
was filming myself sleeping last night

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:24.020 
was filming myself sleeping last night
and<00:06:21.479> I<00:06:22.080> realized<00:06:22.650> that<00:06:22.889> the<00:06:23.190> exporting<00:06:23.789> time

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:24.030 
and I realized that the exporting time

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:28.490 
and I realized that the exporting time
is<00:06:24.330> going<00:06:24.870> to<00:06:25.020> be<00:06:25.610> probably<00:06:26.610> over<00:06:27.419> 4<00:06:27.990> hours

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:28.500 
is going to be probably over 4 hours

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:31.400 
is going to be probably over 4 hours
long<00:06:28.740> so<00:06:29.250> now<00:06:29.970> I'm<00:06:30.210> trying<00:06:30.630> to<00:06:30.750> figure<00:06:30.930> out<00:06:31.080> if

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:31.410 
long so now I'm trying to figure out if

00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:34.129 
long so now I'm trying to figure out if
it's<00:06:31.889> really<00:06:32.310> worth<00:06:32.550> putting<00:06:33.000> in<00:06:33.240> this<00:06:33.570> vlog<00:06:33.870> I

00:06:34.129 --> 00:06:34.139
