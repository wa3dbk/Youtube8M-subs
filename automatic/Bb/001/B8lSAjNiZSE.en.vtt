validate our data in this instance just
for<00:01:23.909> simplicity<00:01:24.479> I<00:01:24.509> chose<00:01:24.780> to<00:01:24.930> use<00:01:24.960> nested<00:01:25.439> if

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
for simplicity I chose to use nested if

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.010 
for simplicity I chose to use nested if
statements<00:01:26.540> basically<00:01:27.540> we're<00:01:27.689> just<00:01:27.720> checking

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
statements basically we're just checking

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.929 
statements basically we're just checking
the<00:01:28.290> length<00:01:28.500> of<00:01:28.650> the<00:01:28.710> text<00:01:28.890> in<00:01:29.159> the<00:01:29.250> text<00:01:29.520> boxes

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
the length of the text in the text boxes

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:31.609 
the length of the text in the text boxes
to<00:01:30.750> make<00:01:30.869> sure<00:01:31.020> they're<00:01:31.170> at<00:01:31.259> least<00:01:31.350> 5

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
to make sure they're at least 5

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.670 
to make sure they're at least 5
characters<00:01:32.100> long<00:01:32.310> if<00:01:32.579> they<00:01:33.119> fell<00:01:33.420> we<00:01:34.380> just

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
characters long if they fell we just

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.700 
characters long if they fell we just
send<00:01:34.890> them<00:01:34.950> a<00:01:35.009> little<00:01:35.130> message<00:01:35.430> to<00:01:35.729> our<00:01:35.759> label

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:36.710 
send them a little message to our label

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:39.140 
send them a little message to our label
if<00:01:37.710> all<00:01:37.860> three<00:01:38.070> of<00:01:38.130> our<00:01:38.250> text<00:01:38.460> boxes<00:01:38.759> validate

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
if all three of our text boxes validate

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:40.969 
if all three of our text boxes validate
just<00:01:39.390> fine<00:01:39.600> then<00:01:40.380> we're<00:01:40.560> going<00:01:40.680> to<00:01:40.710> try<00:01:40.920> to
