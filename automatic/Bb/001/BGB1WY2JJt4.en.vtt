00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:46.970 

okay<00:00:45.030> now<00:00:45.629> the<00:00:45.750> next<00:00:45.780> thing<00:00:46.110> you<00:00:46.230> do<00:00:46.350> in<00:00:46.739> the

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
okay now the next thing you do in the

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.299 
okay now the next thing you do in the
kit<00:00:47.309> you<00:00:47.579> get<00:00:47.760> this<00:00:47.940> long<00:00:48.239> screw<00:00:48.930> so<00:00:49.710> this<00:00:50.010> long

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
kit you get this long screw so this long

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.610 
kit you get this long screw so this long
screw<00:00:50.700> goes<00:00:50.940> through<00:00:51.329> this<00:00:51.480> bit<00:00:51.750> here<00:00:52.050> so<00:00:52.260> we

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
screw goes through this bit here so we

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.240 
screw goes through this bit here so we
do<00:00:52.770> you<00:00:52.920> flip<00:00:53.280> this<00:00:53.489> bit<00:00:53.850> round<00:00:54.890> put<00:00:55.890> this<00:00:56.010> in

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
do you flip this bit round put this in

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:01.549 
do you flip this bit round put this in
here<00:00:58.100> that<00:00:59.100> bit<00:00:59.399> goes<00:00:59.640> round<00:01:00.000> to<00:01:00.780> form<00:01:01.170> a

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
here that bit goes round to form a

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:06.910 
here that bit goes round to form a
spacer<00:01:02.449> okay<00:01:03.680> sits<00:01:04.680> like<00:01:05.070> so<00:01:05.430> and<00:01:06.119> then<00:01:06.330> this

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:06.920 
spacer okay sits like so and then this

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:09.920 
spacer okay sits like so and then this
screw<00:01:07.920> goes<00:01:08.340> up<00:01:08.670> and<00:01:08.909> should<00:01:09.270> forget<00:01:09.630> it<00:01:09.750> right

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
screw goes up and should forget it right

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:24.560 
screw goes up and should forget it right
line<00:01:10.650> up<00:01:10.950> with<00:01:11.280> the<00:01:12.119> original<00:01:16.850> mounting

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.390 

again<00:01:25.570> the<00:01:25.720> next<00:01:25.870> so<00:01:26.590> the<00:01:26.800> screw<00:01:27.100> that<00:01:27.250> we

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:27.400 
again the next so the screw that we

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:28.920 
again the next so the screw that we
originally<00:01:27.580> took<00:01:27.940> out<00:01:28.120> of<00:01:28.240> this<00:01:28.420> mounting

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:28.930 
originally took out of this mounting

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:31.590 
originally took out of this mounting
point<00:01:29.230> we'll<00:01:29.770> use<00:01:30.040> to<00:01:30.280> put<00:01:30.490> in<00:01:30.670> here<00:01:31.030> now<00:01:31.420> if<00:01:31.480> I

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:31.600 
point we'll use to put in here now if I

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.600 
point we'll use to put in here now if I
just<00:01:31.810> pull<00:01:31.990> that<00:01:32.020> to<00:01:32.320> the<00:01:32.440> side<00:01:32.710> you<00:01:33.400> can<00:01:33.580> see

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:33.610 
just pull that to the side you can see

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:35.970 
just pull that to the side you can see
that<00:01:34.000> in<00:01:34.120> the<00:01:34.270> original<00:01:34.390> bumper<00:01:34.870> there's<00:01:35.830> a

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:35.980 
that in the original bumper there's a

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:38.730 
that in the original bumper there's a
little<00:01:36.220> indentation<00:01:36.610> there<00:01:37.390> now<00:01:38.020> when<00:01:38.590> you

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:38.740 
little indentation there now when you

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:41.580 
little indentation there now when you
fit<00:01:39.040> the<00:01:39.340> mudflat<00:01:39.970> you<00:01:40.210> use<00:01:40.540> that<00:01:40.750> indentation

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:41.590 
fit the mudflat you use that indentation
