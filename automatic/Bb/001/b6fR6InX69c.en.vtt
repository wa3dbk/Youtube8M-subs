00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:33.980 
all right this is the victor cart going
just<00:00:04.049> in<00:00:04.200> my<00:00:04.230> backyard<00:00:04.500> here<00:00:05.210> okay

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:33.990 

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:59.930 

ah

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:06.740 

ah<00:01:04.040> it's<00:01:05.040> not<00:01:05.250> tuned<00:01:05.549> yes<00:01:05.790> it's<00:01:06.119> frickin<00:01:06.600> hard

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
ah it's not tuned yes it's frickin hard

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.600 
ah it's not tuned yes it's frickin hard
to<00:01:06.869> tune<00:01:07.110> but<00:01:07.380> also<00:01:07.590> the<00:01:07.950> choke<00:01:08.190> keeps<00:01:08.460> on

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
to tune but also the choke keeps on

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.420 
to tune but also the choke keeps on
going<00:01:08.820> on<00:01:09.000> so<00:01:09.990> I<00:01:10.320> have<00:01:10.770> to<00:01:10.890> work<00:01:11.070> out<00:01:11.220> something

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
going on so I have to work out something

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:18.700 
going on so I have to work out something
to<00:01:12.270> fix<00:01:13.049> that<00:01:13.259> I'm<00:01:14.220> running<00:01:14.490> on<00:01:14.610> 20<00:01:15.509> 21<00:01:15.750> and

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:18.710 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:20.719 

it's<00:01:19.710> not<00:01:19.860> really<00:01:20.040> smoking<00:01:20.430> that<00:01:20.580> much

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
it's not really smoking that much

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.730 
it's not really smoking that much
anymore<00:01:21.000> which<00:01:21.270> is<00:01:21.299> good<00:01:21.600> and<00:01:21.840> once<00:01:22.530> you<00:01:22.619> keep

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
anymore which is good and once you keep

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.090 
anymore which is good and once you keep
on<00:01:22.920> running<00:01:23.220> it<00:01:23.310> it<00:01:23.460> starts<00:01:23.970> to<00:01:24.180> cool

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:25.100 
on running it it starts to cool

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:29.450 
on running it it starts to cool
obviously<00:01:26.100> because<00:01:26.810> just<00:01:28.100> Eiling<00:01:29.100> it's<00:01:29.250> not

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
obviously because just Eiling it's not

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.740 
obviously because just Eiling it's not
really<00:01:29.729> going<00:01:29.820> to<00:01:29.909> cool<00:01:30.180> much<00:01:32.240> but<00:01:33.240> once<00:01:33.600> it<00:01:33.720> is

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
really going to cool much but once it is

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.889 
really going to cool much but once it is
going<00:01:34.200> nicely<00:01:34.890> it<00:01:35.280> should<00:01:35.490> not<00:01:35.850> smoke<00:01:36.720> as<00:01:36.869> much

00:01:36.889 --> 00:01:36.899 
going nicely it should not smoke as much

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:41.749 
going nicely it should not smoke as much
um<00:01:37.830> I<00:01:37.890> jacked<00:01:38.580> it<00:01:38.729> up<00:01:38.819> with<00:01:39.149> a<00:01:40.550> washer<00:01:41.550> and<00:01:41.580> a

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
um I jacked it up with a washer and a

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.830 
um I jacked it up with a washer and a
spring<00:01:42.060> washer<00:01:42.149> and<00:01:42.649> that<00:01:43.649> gives<00:01:43.800> it<00:01:43.979> a<00:01:44.100> nice

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:44.840 
spring washer and that gives it a nice

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:48.620 
spring washer and that gives it a nice
chain<00:01:45.840> tension<00:01:46.289> that's<00:01:47.069> enough<00:01:48.060> it's<00:01:48.240> not<00:01:48.450> it

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
chain tension that's enough it's not it

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:53.059 
chain tension that's enough it's not it
doesn't<00:01:49.310> you<00:01:50.310> know<00:01:50.340> go<00:01:50.460> over<00:01:50.850> and<00:01:51.950> once<00:01:52.950> the

00:01:53.059 --> 00:01:53.069 
doesn't you know go over and once the

00:01:53.069 --> 00:01:59.149 
doesn't you know go over and once the
cut<00:01:54.020> top<00:01:55.020> clutch<00:01:55.350> still<00:01:55.710> hot<00:01:56.270> um<00:01:57.950> but<00:01:58.950> yeah

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
cut top clutch still hot um but yeah

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:02.930 
cut top clutch still hot um but yeah
that<00:01:59.990> that<00:02:00.990> makes<00:02:01.140> it<00:02:01.259> nicely<00:02:01.729> that<00:02:02.729> makes<00:02:02.880> it

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:02.940 
that that makes it nicely that makes it

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:06.729 
that that makes it nicely that makes it
nicer<00:02:03.360> um<00:02:04.220> yeah<00:02:05.220> so<00:02:05.340> that<00:02:05.489> carb<00:02:05.729> isn't<00:02:06.060> tunes

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:06.739 
nicer um yeah so that carb isn't tunes

00:02:06.739 --> 00:02:09.020 
nicer um yeah so that carb isn't tunes
like<00:02:07.739> I<00:02:07.890> said<00:02:08.099> it's<00:02:08.220> pretty<00:02:08.310> hard<00:02:08.489> to<00:02:08.550> cheering

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
like I said it's pretty hard to cheering

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:10.609 
like I said it's pretty hard to cheering
and<00:02:09.149> I<00:02:09.569> still<00:02:09.840> haven't<00:02:10.020> got<00:02:10.200> a<00:02:10.229> little<00:02:10.410> piece

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
and I still haven't got a little piece

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:11.930 
and I still haven't got a little piece
for<00:02:10.890> the<00:02:10.950> spark<00:02:11.220> plug<00:02:11.400> so<00:02:11.520> that<00:02:11.640> keeps<00:02:11.819> them

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
for the spark plug so that keeps them

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:16.309 
for the spark plug so that keeps them
coming<00:02:12.060> off<00:02:13.250> but<00:02:14.250> it<00:02:14.790> is<00:02:14.970> going<00:02:15.300> so<00:02:15.480> I'll<00:02:15.810> start

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:16.319 
coming off but it is going so I'll start

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:20.589 
coming off but it is going so I'll start
it<00:02:16.410> up<00:02:16.470> again<00:02:16.590> I'll<00:02:16.890> just<00:02:17.099> wheel<00:02:17.640> it<00:02:17.730> back<00:02:19.580> and

00:02:20.589 --> 00:02:20.599 
it up again I'll just wheel it back and

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:23.270 
it up again I'll just wheel it back and
if<00:02:21.599> you're<00:02:22.470> not<00:02:22.530> on<00:02:22.680> the<00:02:22.800> cart<00:02:23.010> and<00:02:23.040> you<00:02:23.160> put

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
if you're not on the cart and you put

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:24.470 
if you're not on the cart and you put
your<00:02:23.310> foot<00:02:23.489> to<00:02:23.550> the<00:02:23.610> floor<00:02:23.730> it<00:02:23.940> does<00:02:24.060> burn<00:02:24.270> out

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
your foot to the floor it does burn out

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.660 
your foot to the floor it does burn out
it's<00:02:24.750> pretty<00:02:24.930> cool<00:02:25.080> so<00:02:26.010> I'll<00:02:26.190> just<00:02:26.220> start<00:02:26.550> up

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
it's pretty cool so I'll just start up

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:38.660 
it's pretty cool so I'll just start up
one<00:02:26.819> more<00:02:26.970> time<00:02:27.000> I'll<00:02:27.330> try<00:02:37.040> mmm<00:02:38.040> nobody's

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
one more time I'll try mmm nobody's

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:53.670 
one more time I'll try mmm nobody's
going<00:02:38.819> to<00:02:38.910> start<00:02:39.209> give<00:02:39.510> me<00:02:39.599> a<00:02:39.629> sec

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:53.680 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:57.790 

spark<00:02:54.680> plug<00:02:54.740> came<00:02:55.070> up<00:02:55.220> again<00:02:56.200> um<00:02:57.200> but<00:02:57.560> here<00:02:57.710> you

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:57.800 
spark plug came up again um but here you

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:00.610 
spark plug came up again um but here you
can<00:02:57.890> see<00:02:58.070> it's<00:02:58.160> running<00:02:58.430> um<00:02:59.290> weld<00:03:00.290> this<00:03:00.440> up<00:03:00.560> a

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:00.620 
can see it's running um weld this up a

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:05.530 
can see it's running um weld this up a
little<00:03:00.710> bit<00:03:00.890> more<00:03:03.100> tune<00:03:04.100> it<00:03:04.250> and<00:03:04.460> then<00:03:05.330> take

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:05.540 
little bit more tune it and then take

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:07.560 
little bit more tune it and then take
for<00:03:05.720> a<00:03:05.780> run<00:03:05.930> on<00:03:06.080> the<00:03:06.110> street<00:03:06.320> it's<00:03:06.770> dark<00:03:07.070> now

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:07.570 
for a run on the street it's dark now

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:14.590 
for a run on the street it's dark now
it's<00:03:08.620> 2<00:03:09.620> out<00:03:09.650> 5<00:03:10.010> 30<00:03:10.310> ish<00:03:10.730> I<00:03:11.090> guess<00:03:11.470> so<00:03:12.470> um<00:03:13.600> yeah

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.290 
got a few holes because I just trying
out<00:03:38.030> the<00:03:38.180> new<00:03:38.210> sticks<00:03:39.580> see<00:03:40.580> the<00:03:40.700> nice<00:03:40.940> welds

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:44.080 
out the new sticks see the nice welds
there<00:03:41.510> but<00:03:42.200> um<00:03:42.350> this<00:03:43.190> is<00:03:43.400> this<00:03:43.610> is<00:03:43.730> my<00:03:43.850> first

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:44.090 
there but um this is this is my first

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:46.300 
there but um this is this is my first
one<00:03:44.300> and<00:03:44.330> I<00:03:44.480> put<00:03:45.110> it<00:03:45.200> too<00:03:45.350> many<00:03:45.500> high<00:03:45.680> amps<00:03:46.130> and

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:46.310 
one and I put it too many high amps and

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:48.400 
one and I put it too many high amps and
really<00:03:47.090> should<00:03:47.210> done<00:03:47.360> test<00:03:47.660> piece<00:03:47.930> but<00:03:48.200> oh

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:48.410 
really should done test piece but oh

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:52.860 
really should done test piece but oh
well<00:03:48.800> and<00:03:49.340> then<00:03:49.430> I<00:03:49.520> bolted<00:03:49.730> this<00:03:50.000> through<00:03:50.240> here

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:52.870 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:55.990 

cut<00:03:53.870> all<00:03:53.960> these<00:03:54.110> pieces<00:03:54.560> with<00:03:54.860> money<00:03:55.040> drops

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:56.000 
cut all these pieces with money drops

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:01.620 
cut all these pieces with money drops
all<00:03:56.410> so<00:03:57.410> murky<00:03:57.890> die<00:03:58.040> drop<00:03:58.280> saw<00:03:58.460> it<00:03:59.390> was<00:03:59.540> armed

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:01.630 
all so murky die drop saw it was armed

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:05.950 
all so murky die drop saw it was armed
260<00:04:02.630> I<00:04:02.690> think<00:04:02.900> so<00:04:04.150> they<00:04:05.150> will<00:04:05.300> stand<00:04:05.540> up<00:04:05.750> at<00:04:05.900> the

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:05.960 
260 I think so they will stand up at the

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:07.660 
260 I think so they will stand up at the
back<00:04:06.080> of<00:04:06.110> the<00:04:06.230> you<00:04:06.380> and<00:04:06.590> that<00:04:07.160> will<00:04:07.310> lean<00:04:07.520> on

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:07.670 
back of the you and that will lean on

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:10.270 
back of the you and that will lean on
the<00:04:07.790> front<00:04:08.120> part<00:04:08.420> and<00:04:08.930> what<00:04:09.890> I'm<00:04:09.980> going<00:04:10.010> to<00:04:10.130> do

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:10.280 
the front part and what I'm going to do

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:14.500 
the front part and what I'm going to do
is<00:04:10.600> weld<00:04:11.600> two<00:04:11.870> bars<00:04:12.170> on<00:04:12.440> and<00:04:12.970> then<00:04:13.970> they'll

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:14.510 
is weld two bars on and then they'll

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:19.120 
is weld two bars on and then they'll
clip<00:04:14.810> over<00:04:15.170> and<00:04:15.460> then<00:04:17.680> just<00:04:18.680> imagine<00:04:19.040> this

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:19.130 
clip over and then just imagine this

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:20.470 
clip over and then just imagine this
standing<00:04:19.520> up<00:04:19.609> on<00:04:19.670> the<00:04:19.730> other<00:04:19.880> one<00:04:19.970> standing<00:04:20.330> up

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:20.480 
standing up on the other one standing up

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:24.640 
standing up on the other one standing up
and<00:04:20.840> I'll<00:04:21.170> weld<00:04:21.410> a<00:04:21.500> bar<00:04:21.710> in<00:04:22.520> between<00:04:22.910> and<00:04:23.650> then

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:24.650 
and I'll weld a bar in between and then

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:27.490 
and I'll weld a bar in between and then
he's<00:04:24.740> going<00:04:24.860> to<00:04:24.920> put<00:04:25.100> a<00:04:25.130> tarp<00:04:25.400> over<00:04:25.550> it<00:04:25.820> so<00:04:26.500> you

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:27.500 
he's going to put a tarp over it so you

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:28.870 
he's going to put a tarp over it so you
probably<00:04:27.680> don't<00:04:27.920> understand<00:04:28.340> whatever<00:04:28.580> i'm

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:28.880 
probably don't understand whatever i'm

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:31.420 
probably don't understand whatever i'm
saying<00:04:29.150> just<00:04:29.360> then<00:04:29.510> but<00:04:29.980> once<00:04:30.980> it's<00:04:31.160> all<00:04:31.250> made

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:31.430 
saying just then but once it's all made

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:33.340
