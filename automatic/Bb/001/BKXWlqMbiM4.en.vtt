00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:13.349
 for my dear friends today I want 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:15.059
 tell you about not be afraid of such a word 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:20.100
 the most important process 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:23.010
 those tvm technology is making it 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.779
 soil remediation with 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.640
 her 

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:30.390
 the same m compost which already 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:33.000
 told him once and just waste 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:37.680
 any or greens for this you 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:40.110
 need ordinary villas and a shovel 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:43.050
 although they technology as they say 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:45.930
 spade does not apply did not speak and 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:48.300
 first choose but still left and 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:52.050
 here it is very useful to you 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:54.180
 I'm not talking about how I tell you 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:59.340
 told to make high beds shovel 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:01:02.600
 also need but closer to do first 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:06.630
 beds that you make a new bed 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:10.580
 dig a trench to the depth and width 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:12.680
 shovels me depth shovel 25 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:15.119
 centimeters ie full width 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:16.439
 drive and make such a channel and 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:20.990
 lay out 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:20.990
 m compost really well still says 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:29.689
 water sure to water m 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:34.350
 1 to 100 solution 

00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:40.710
 it's on a bucket of water for 10 liters 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:43.439
 Shot pile Shot attack temp or 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:46.670
 sugar syrup or jam and talked 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:49.829
 Yes, and a shot 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:55.189
 m drug that I already 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:58.430
 told further you retreated a little 

00:01:55.189 --> 00:02:02.759
 throwing this trench 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:05.040
 next you want to throw her want 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:06.799
 draw your attention that is in 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:09.959
 um technology is boiling about what 

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:13.230
 a land coup should not be therefore 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:15.540
 make sure that the land which 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:19.200
 on top also on top there and lay 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:22.470
 slowly and show you that is she 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:27.060
 also here on top and lies and so is the layer behind 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:32.610
 layer before you start doing this 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:36.569
 the process is better for efficient 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:44.310
 microorganisms they will take root will enter 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:53.750
 the winter is strong here and you have prepared 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:03:04.530
 next button to fertilize the word 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:03:08.430
 throw it level water the water 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:10.590
 solution for convenience, leave the field 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:13.459
 bath here because the third 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:16.440
 roses you already do not remember 

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:19.500
 you watered it here or not and exactly 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:20.400
 also following this groove 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:22.579
 throw 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:26.760
 this is the most effective way 

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:31.940
 restore the health of your garden 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:39.540
 if we say so autumn you do not have yet 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:45.450
 such a compost presence cabbage what 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:48.889
 then do then do just m 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:53.540
 the solution is the same concentration of 1 to 100 and 

00:03:48.889 --> 00:03:57.150
 just watering your garden 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:04:00.510
 row next to spill your garden 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:05.320
 this method is less effective as well 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:08.240
 says wants a 

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:10.820
 how not to eat but some help for 

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:13.850
 your kind will be if you have 

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:16.790
 cultivator and let's say your area 

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:23.800
 large vegetable garden by hand in this way 

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:25.010
 not dig it hard but here it is possible 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:28.460
 also 

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:31.190
 m compost sprinkle a thin layer 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:35.120
 scatter on the ground and about cultivate 

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:38.900
 its this way of course a little 

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:42.440
 inferior to the one that showed first with 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:45.650
 rolling but with large areas and 

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:49.280
 it is possible to mechanize your work a little 

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:52.430
 it is also good how to be with those 

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:55.880
 high beds about which I tell you a lot 

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:59.990
 talked so much in high beds 

00:04:55.880 --> 00:05:03.110
 across dig uncomfortable you destroy 

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:09.170
 so do the same thing 

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:13.960
 trench along length and with the next 

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:18.200
 the beds you will have done 

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:20.210
 groove laid m compost example and with 

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:25.070
 next bed making groove you 

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:28.100
 throwing the previous bed is when 

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:31.160
 make new beds which charge 

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:35.169
 already have an example with strawberries yes here 

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:40.700
 Eat the beds there is such a time that 

00:05:35.169 --> 00:05:43.340
 agrofibre such property is destroyed 

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:45.710
 depends on the manufacturer barrel in a year 

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:51.980
 in two but the strawberries are destroyed and we 

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:55.330
 grow 3-4 years in the fall you shoot 

00:05:51.980 --> 00:06:00.680
 wear ara this compost 

00:05:55.330 --> 00:06:02.750
 Then cover the agrofibre then in the spring as 

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:08.570
 same to be in those years when there is and 

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:12.230
 agrofibre and she winters well 

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:15.040
 Has stood how to bring there mkm 

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:17.770
 compost ie fertilizer 

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:20.820
 I will tell you about this before 

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:20.820
 see you soon bye
