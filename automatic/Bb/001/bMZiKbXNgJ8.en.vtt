 but 

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:38.560
 well then what I'm going to need 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:40.750
 This is a candleholder and little talk this 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:44.260
 I already had it but they can get it 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:48.550
 in the dollar store likewise the 

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:51.580
 carry candles and I'll be using a 

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:54.070
 spray that is in metallic gold color 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:56.920
 and good first thing I'm going to start 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:59.710
 doing is going to be wondering very well the 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:02.470
 candle holder and also the patent leather and is 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:05.650
 until leaving it well covered and 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:11.369
 let it dry around 15 minutes and 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:11.369
 that this paint dries too fast 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:29.040
 already when it is hosted in the part of 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:32.330
 in front of me now I'm going to flip the tray 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:35.100
 and I'm going to paint it from the back 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:37.110
 until it is well covered and 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:39.570
 let it dry others have minutes 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:41.790
 then I will use place since 

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:44.100
 you want to use glück or want 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:47.310
 use hot silicone on the switch 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:48.960
 it is your preference this time 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:52.190
 as I'm doing it outside I 'm going to 

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:52.190
 apply this blue 

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:01.310
 and then I'll leave to dry 

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:04.130
 around 10 minutes to make sure 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:06.710
 that we are not going to fall this 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:09.620
 Glue is super good and good 

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:12.560
 then you see how easy this day is and 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:16.360

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:16.360

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:24.410

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:36.170
 I will be using this pumpkin that 

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:39.560
 it's like starting in the middle that seems 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:42.379
 like the Cinderella car and well 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:45.110
 is already very deteriorated and I wanted 

00:03:42.379 --> 00:03:48.440
 give it as a more feminine touch more 

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:51.500

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:54.140

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:59.000
 dollars whether you want 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:01.579
 paint something they already have there that is 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.880
 like old metal and who want to give 

00:04:01.579 --> 00:04:05.460
 one more touch 

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:08.100
 no more to decorate 

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:10.710

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:13.170

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:14.490

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:18.090
