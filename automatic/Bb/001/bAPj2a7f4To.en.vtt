to me the website has to do with

to me the website has to do with
stretching<00:00:08.880> and<00:00:09.269> the<00:00:09.840> question<00:00:10.830> was

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040 
stretching and the question was

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.580 
stretching and the question was
initially<00:00:11.759> about<00:00:12.059> but<00:00:12.330> these<00:00:12.450> positions<00:00:13.080> here

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
initially about but these positions here

reaching<00:00:17.250> these<00:00:17.970> notes<00:00:18.359> and<00:00:18.600> didn't<00:00:18.869> know

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
reaching these notes and didn't know

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.529 
reaching these notes and didn't know
what<00:00:19.710> to<00:00:19.830> do<00:00:20.010> but<00:00:20.490> it<00:00:20.640> opens<00:00:20.970> up<00:00:21.090> a<00:00:21.180> larger

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
what to do but it opens up a larger

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:24.439 
what to do but it opens up a larger
question<00:00:21.750> of<00:00:22.050> of<00:00:22.910> stretching<00:00:23.910> on<00:00:24.060> the<00:00:24.180> cello

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
question of of stretching on the cello

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.349 
question of of stretching on the cello
and<00:00:24.840> how<00:00:25.710> to<00:00:25.769> do<00:00:25.980> it<00:00:26.010> went<00:00:26.519> to<00:00:26.640> do<00:00:26.760> it<00:00:26.939> wide<00:00:27.330> to

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
and how to do it went to do it wide to

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.339 
and how to do it went to do it wide to
do<00:00:27.720> it<00:00:27.869> I<00:00:28.640> find<00:00:29.640> it<00:00:29.849> quite<00:00:30.539> often<00:00:30.840> that<00:00:31.199> I<00:00:31.320> I

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
do it I find it quite often that I I

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:35.120 
do it I find it quite often that I I
hear<00:00:32.009> jealous<00:00:32.550> play<00:00:32.880> who<00:00:33.420> have<00:00:34.079> plenty<00:00:34.860> big

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
hear jealous play who have plenty big

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.130 
hear jealous play who have plenty big
enough<00:00:35.160> hand<00:00:35.760> to<00:00:35.969> stretch<00:00:36.239> but<00:00:36.480> don't<00:00:36.750> stretch

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
enough hand to stretch but don't stretch

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:50.100 
enough hand to stretch but don't stretch
over<00:00:37.710> there<00:00:38.010> or<00:00:38.370> this<00:00:38.879> one<00:00:39.239> Beethoven<00:00:39.719> sonata

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:50.110 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:54.580 

and<00:00:51.110> I<00:00:52.100> figured<00:00:53.030> well<00:00:53.239> that<00:00:53.960> passage<00:00:54.350> would<00:00:54.440> be

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:54.590 
and I figured well that passage would be

00:00:54.590 --> 00:01:08.700 
and I figured well that passage would be
a<00:00:54.620> lot<00:00:54.829> cleaner<00:00:55.250> if<00:00:56.030> somebody<00:00:56.510> just

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:08.710 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:11.469 

those<00:01:09.710> are<00:01:09.830> not<00:01:10.010> very<00:01:10.040> extreme<00:01:10.820> stretches<00:01:11.330> but

00:01:11.469 --> 00:01:11.479 
those are not very extreme stretches but

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:14.679 
those are not very extreme stretches but
they<00:01:11.659> are<00:01:11.810> stretches<00:01:12.350> so<00:01:13.119> some<00:01:14.119> chela's<00:01:14.330> have

00:01:14.679 --> 00:01:14.689 
they are stretches so some chela's have

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:16.390 
they are stretches so some chela's have
very<00:01:14.990> big<00:01:15.200> hands<00:01:15.680> and<00:01:15.830> can<00:01:16.100> stretch

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:16.400 
very big hands and can stretch

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:19.600 
very big hands and can stretch
everything<00:01:17.390> and<00:01:17.830> other<00:01:18.830> trellis<00:01:19.220> have<00:01:19.400> very

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:19.610 
everything and other trellis have very

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:21.300 
everything and other trellis have very
small<00:01:19.820> hands<00:01:20.180> and<00:01:20.450> have<00:01:20.570> to<00:01:20.750> walk<00:01:20.960> from<00:01:21.229> one

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:21.310 
small hands and have to walk from one

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:23.770 
small hands and have to walk from one
position<00:01:22.310> to<00:01:22.580> another<00:01:22.729> of<00:01:23.240> one<00:01:23.390> node<00:01:23.600> to

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:23.780 
position to another of one node to

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:26.170 
position to another of one node to
another<00:01:23.810> but<00:01:24.320> I<00:01:24.470> believe<00:01:24.950> that<00:01:25.220> cellists<00:01:26.000> all

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:26.180 
another but I believe that cellists all

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:28.090 
another but I believe that cellists all
shows<00:01:26.509> should<00:01:26.810> have<00:01:27.080> the<00:01:27.229> ability<00:01:27.619> to<00:01:27.680> stretch

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:28.100 
shows should have the ability to stretch

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:30.070 
shows should have the ability to stretch
you<00:01:28.610> know<00:01:28.700> violinists<00:01:29.299> use<00:01:29.420> it<00:01:29.630> much<00:01:29.840> more

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:30.080 
you know violinists use it much more

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:32.460 
you know violinists use it much more
often<00:01:30.409> but<00:01:30.530> they<00:01:30.680> call<00:01:30.920> it<00:01:31.090> extending

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:32.470 
often but they call it extending

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:35.680 
often but they call it extending
extensions<00:01:33.759> we<00:01:34.759> call<00:01:34.940> it<00:01:35.090> stretching<00:01:35.509> because

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:35.690 
extensions we call it stretching because

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:38.370 
extensions we call it stretching because
I<00:01:36.170> don't<00:01:36.619> know<00:01:36.710> I<00:01:36.950> call<00:01:37.250> this<00:01:37.340> magic<00:01:37.729> anyway

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:38.380 
I don't know I call this magic anyway

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:41.050 
I don't know I call this magic anyway

I tell you after you do that chapter you
feel<00:02:09.290> like<00:02:09.800> you<00:02:09.950> can<00:02:10.130> you<00:02:10.490> never<00:02:10.670> have<00:02:10.910> to

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:11.030 
feel like you can you never have to

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:12.760 
feel like you can you never have to
shift<00:02:11.240> like<00:02:11.780> you<00:02:11.900> can<00:02:12.050> stretch<00:02:12.290> from<00:02:12.410> every

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:12.770 
shift like you can stretch from every

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:15.670 
shift like you can stretch from every
note<00:02:12.920> to<00:02:13.070> every<00:02:13.340> note<00:02:13.520> I<00:02:14.360> think<00:02:15.320> there's

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:15.680 
note to every note I think there's

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:16.840 
note to every note I think there's
there's<00:02:16.010> a<00:02:16.130> happy<00:02:16.310> medium<00:02:16.490> between

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:16.850 
there's a happy medium between

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:19.420 
there's a happy medium between
stretching<00:02:17.750> and<00:02:17.990> shifting<00:02:18.440> I'll<00:02:19.010> give<00:02:19.220> you<00:02:19.310> an

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:19.430 
stretching and shifting I'll give you an

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:22.570 
stretching and shifting I'll give you an
example<00:02:19.900> if<00:02:20.900> I<00:02:21.110> can<00:02:21.320> stretch<00:02:21.560> unlucky<00:02:22.070> other

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:22.580 
example if I can stretch unlucky other

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:25.240 
example if I can stretch unlucky other
hand<00:02:22.940> medium-sized<00:02:23.840> hair<00:02:24.200> but<00:02:24.410> I'm<00:02:24.590> playing

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:25.250 
hand medium-sized hair but I'm playing

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:33.460 
hand medium-sized hair but I'm playing
stretch<00:02:25.760> for<00:02:26.090> you<00:02:28.390> the<00:02:29.390> largest<00:02:31.690> is<00:02:32.690> also<00:02:33.110> very

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:33.470 
stretch for you the largest is also very

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:38.300 
stretch for you the largest is also very
useful

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:44.309 

gives<00:02:39.310> me<00:02:39.460> the<00:02:39.490> ability<00:02:39.700> to<00:02:40.090> remember<00:02:43.110> I<00:02:44.110> am

00:02:44.309 --> 00:02:44.319 
gives me the ability to remember I am

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:46.710 
gives me the ability to remember I am
but<00:02:45.040> when<00:02:45.220> I<00:02:45.250> can't<00:02:45.640> stretch<00:02:46.000> for<00:02:46.240> example<00:02:46.630> in

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:46.720 
but when I can't stretch for example in

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:49.470 
but when I can't stretch for example in
first<00:02:46.959> position

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:52.240 

the<00:02:50.480> light<00:02:50.780> I<00:02:51.050> can't<00:02:51.319> really<00:02:51.560> quite<00:02:51.830> get<00:02:52.099> that

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:52.250 
the light I can't really quite get that

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:55.059 
the light I can't really quite get that
and<00:02:52.730> so<00:02:52.760> if<00:02:53.209> I<00:02:53.360> have<00:02:53.569> to<00:02:53.720> shift<00:02:53.989> from<00:02:54.380> here<00:02:54.680> and

00:02:55.059 --> 00:02:55.069 
and so if I have to shift from here and

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:57.550 
and so if I have to shift from here and
here<00:02:55.750> I<00:02:56.750> have<00:02:56.930> a<00:02:57.020> choice

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:57.560 
here I have a choice

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:07.110 
here I have a choice
are<00:02:57.920> you<00:02:58.040> sure<00:02:58.510> a<00:02:59.510> minor<00:02:59.810> firm

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:07.120 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:10.929 

or<00:03:08.120> I<00:03:08.659> can<00:03:09.049> shift<00:03:09.290> a<00:03:09.499> half-step<00:03:10.069> up<00:03:10.310> to<00:03:10.549> help<00:03:10.760> to

00:03:10.929 --> 00:03:10.939 
or I can shift a half-step up to help to

00:03:10.939 --> 00:03:16.440 
or I can shift a half-step up to help to
half<00:03:11.150> extend<00:03:12.139> my<00:03:12.379> arm<00:03:12.620> and<00:03:13.569> grab<00:03:14.569> it<00:03:14.599> that<00:03:14.900> way

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:16.450 
half extend my arm and grab it that way

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:20.349 
half extend my arm and grab it that way
which<00:03:17.450> is<00:03:17.569> ultimately<00:03:17.989> cleaner<00:03:18.620> so<00:03:19.549> for<00:03:20.209> those

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:20.359 
which is ultimately cleaner so for those

00:03:20.359 --> 00:03:23.589 
which is ultimately cleaner so for those
who<00:03:20.629> can't<00:03:20.870> quite<00:03:21.200> reach<00:03:21.969> between<00:03:22.969> two<00:03:23.389> notes

00:03:23.589 --> 00:03:23.599 
who can't quite reach between two notes

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:25.300 
who can't quite reach between two notes
that<00:03:23.810> you<00:03:23.900> want<00:03:23.930> to<00:03:24.170> make<00:03:24.290> clean<00:03:24.590> the<00:03:25.129> best

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:25.310 
that you want to make clean the best

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:27.399 
that you want to make clean the best
thing<00:03:25.549> to<00:03:25.579> do<00:03:25.849> is<00:03:26.060> to<00:03:26.239> stretch<00:03:26.540> as<00:03:26.870> far<00:03:26.930> as<00:03:27.290> you

00:03:27.399 --> 00:03:27.409 
thing to do is to stretch as far as you

00:03:27.409 --> 00:03:30.550 
thing to do is to stretch as far as you
can<00:03:27.650> and<00:03:27.889> then<00:03:28.370> shift<00:03:28.819> the<00:03:29.569> remainder<00:03:30.169> of<00:03:30.200> the

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:30.560 
can and then shift the remainder of the

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:32.559 
can and then shift the remainder of the
distance<00:03:30.980> that<00:03:31.159> will<00:03:31.579> give<00:03:31.760> you<00:03:31.879> the<00:03:32.030> cleanest

00:03:32.559 --> 00:03:32.569 
distance that will give you the cleanest

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:34.809 
distance that will give you the cleanest
fingerings<00:03:33.469> and<00:03:33.650> if<00:03:34.129> we<00:03:34.310> want<00:03:34.519> to<00:03:34.609> play

00:03:34.809 --> 00:03:34.819 
fingerings and if we want to play

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:37.690 
fingerings and if we want to play
cleanly<00:03:35.239> like<00:03:35.900> in<00:03:36.079> Bach<00:03:36.319> for<00:03:36.650> example<00:03:37.099> or<00:03:37.280> even

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:37.700 
cleanly like in Bach for example or even

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:40.539 
cleanly like in Bach for example or even
a<00:03:38.030> simple<00:03:38.209> melody<00:03:38.569> it's<00:03:39.409> very<00:03:39.859> useful<00:03:40.340> to<00:03:40.370> be

00:03:40.539 --> 00:03:40.549 
a simple melody it's very useful to be

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:42.819 
a simple melody it's very useful to be
able<00:03:40.579> to<00:03:40.790> stretch<00:03:41.150> so<00:03:41.659> my<00:03:41.930> recommendation<00:03:42.650> is

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:42.829 
able to stretch so my recommendation is

00:03:42.829 --> 00:03:45.339 
able to stretch so my recommendation is
to<00:03:42.980> find<00:03:43.370> in<00:03:44.239> your<00:03:44.480> hand<00:03:44.750> what<00:03:44.989> you<00:03:45.019> can

00:03:45.339 --> 00:03:45.349 
to find in your hand what you can

00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:47.319 
to find in your hand what you can
stretch<00:03:45.680> in<00:03:45.829> what<00:03:45.980> you<00:03:46.129> can<00:03:46.370> stretch<00:03:46.760> know

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:47.329 
stretch in what you can stretch know

00:03:47.329 --> 00:03:49.720 
stretch in what you can stretch know
your<00:03:47.569> limitations<00:03:47.989> like<00:03:48.349> a<00:03:48.409> cap<00:03:48.709> nose<00:03:49.010> from

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:49.730 
your limitations like a cap nose from

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:53.589 
your limitations like a cap nose from
the<00:03:49.790> length<00:03:50.060> of<00:03:50.329> its<00:03:50.569> whiskers<00:03:50.840> what<00:03:52.359> size<00:03:53.359> of

00:03:53.589 --> 00:03:53.599 
the length of its whiskers what size of

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:55.420 
the length of its whiskers what size of
the<00:03:53.689> doorway<00:03:54.109> or<00:03:54.290> space<00:03:54.530> it<00:03:54.709> can<00:03:54.859> pass<00:03:55.069> through

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:55.430 
the doorway or space it can pass through

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:57.520 
the doorway or space it can pass through
you<00:03:55.760> have<00:03:55.939> to<00:03:56.090> know<00:03:56.239> in<00:03:56.510> your<00:03:56.689> hand<00:03:56.959> what<00:03:57.379> you

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:57.530 
you have to know in your hand what you

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:00.369 
you have to know in your hand what you
can<00:03:57.680> reach<00:03:57.859> in<00:03:58.010> what<00:03:58.159> you<00:03:58.280> can<00:03:58.989> keep<00:03:59.989> in<00:04:00.169> mind

00:04:00.369 --> 00:04:00.379 
can reach in what you can keep in mind

00:04:00.379 --> 00:04:04.390 
can reach in what you can keep in mind
also<00:04:00.620> for<00:04:01.040> stretching<00:04:01.489> that<00:04:02.560> one<00:04:03.560> stretches

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:04.400 
also for stretching that one stretches

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:07.119 
also for stretching that one stretches
most<00:04:04.879> naturally<00:04:05.569> not<00:04:05.750> like<00:04:05.959> this<00:04:06.229> but<00:04:06.949> like

00:04:07.119 --> 00:04:07.129 
most naturally not like this but like

00:04:07.129 --> 00:04:07.420 
most naturally not like this but like
this

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:07.430 
this

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:10.240 
this
with<00:04:07.759> the<00:04:07.849> hand<00:04:08.090> open<00:04:08.359> so<00:04:09.229> if<00:04:09.500> you're<00:04:09.739> in<00:04:09.919> first

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:10.250 
with the hand open so if you're in first

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:12.009 
with the hand open so if you're in first
position<00:04:10.400> saying<00:04:10.939> you<00:04:11.209> want<00:04:11.389> to<00:04:11.479> make<00:04:11.689> a<00:04:11.720> big

00:04:12.009 --> 00:04:12.019 
position saying you want to make a big

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:15.909 
position saying you want to make a big
stretch<00:04:13.389> open<00:04:14.389> up<00:04:14.689> the<00:04:14.870> hand<00:04:15.139> take<00:04:15.530> the<00:04:15.680> thumb

00:04:15.909 --> 00:04:15.919 
stretch open up the hand take the thumb

00:04:15.919 --> 00:04:18.520 
stretch open up the hand take the thumb
away<00:04:16.359> because<00:04:17.359> if<00:04:17.509> you<00:04:17.599> try<00:04:17.840> to<00:04:17.900> keep<00:04:18.169> it<00:04:18.349> in

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:18.530 
away because if you try to keep it in

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:22.149 
away because if you try to keep it in
here<00:04:19.190> it<00:04:19.789> will<00:04:19.940> cramp<00:04:20.329> the<00:04:20.570> hand<00:04:20.810> so<00:04:21.620> get<00:04:21.889> used

00:04:22.149 --> 00:04:22.159 
here it will cramp the hand so get used

00:04:22.159 --> 00:04:24.159 
here it will cramp the hand so get used
to<00:04:22.430> when<00:04:22.759> you<00:04:22.880> when<00:04:23.270> you<00:04:23.389> need<00:04:23.599> to<00:04:23.630> like<00:04:23.990> for

00:04:24.159 --> 00:04:24.169 
to when you when you need to like for

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:25.659 
to when you when you need to like for
example<00:04:24.199> in<00:04:24.680> the<00:04:24.830> first<00:04:25.009> two<00:04:25.190> notes<00:04:25.370> of<00:04:25.580> that

00:04:25.659 --> 00:04:25.669 
example in the first two notes of that

00:04:25.669 --> 00:04:29.070 
example in the first two notes of that
box<00:04:25.940> we<00:04:26.210> I<00:04:26.240> just<00:04:26.330> play<00:04:26.720> it<00:04:26.840> up

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:29.080 

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:35.999 

I<00:04:29.110> actually<00:04:30.629> do<00:04:31.629> take<00:04:31.870> the<00:04:32.020> phone<00:04:32.259> back<00:04:35.009> just

00:04:35.999 --> 00:04:36.009 
I actually do take the phone back just

00:04:36.009 --> 00:04:38.580 
I actually do take the phone back just
for<00:04:36.250> a<00:04:36.310> moment<00:04:36.610> it<00:04:36.940> allows<00:04:37.720> me<00:04:37.960> to<00:04:38.110> reach<00:04:38.349> that

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:38.590 
for a moment it allows me to reach that

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:40.830 
for a moment it allows me to reach that
distance<00:04:39.069> and<00:04:39.250> then<00:04:39.340> I<00:04:39.400> put<00:04:39.669> it<00:04:39.759> right<00:04:39.879> back<00:04:40.509> so

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:40.840 
distance and then I put it right back so

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:42.869 
distance and then I put it right back so
stretching<00:04:41.530> can<00:04:41.680> be<00:04:41.860> actually<00:04:42.310> feels<00:04:42.699> good<00:04:42.819> I

00:04:42.869 --> 00:04:42.879 
stretching can be actually feels good I

00:04:42.879 --> 00:04:44.219 
stretching can be actually feels good I
think<00:04:42.970> it's<00:04:43.150> very<00:04:43.240> good<00:04:43.360> for<00:04:43.720> the<00:04:43.810> hand<00:04:44.020> I

00:04:44.219 --> 00:04:44.229 
think it's very good for the hand I

00:04:44.229 --> 00:04:45.779 
think it's very good for the hand I
think<00:04:44.500> it's<00:04:44.590> one<00:04:44.710> reason<00:04:44.860> my<00:04:45.159> hand<00:04:45.430> and<00:04:45.639> stay

00:04:45.779 --> 00:04:45.789 
think it's one reason my hand and stay

00:04:45.789 --> 00:04:48.119 
think it's one reason my hand and stay
healthy<00:04:46.449> all<00:04:46.840> these<00:04:46.990> years<00:04:47.229> because<00:04:47.440> I<00:04:47.620> do<00:04:47.740> a

00:04:48.119 --> 00:04:48.129 
healthy all these years because I do a

00:04:48.129 --> 00:04:49.649 
healthy all these years because I do a
lot<00:04:48.490> of<00:04:48.520> stretching<00:04:48.909> when<00:04:49.180> I<00:04:49.210> play<00:04:49.479> especially

00:04:49.649 --> 00:04:49.659 
lot of stretching when I play especially

00:04:49.659 --> 00:04:51.510 
lot of stretching when I play especially
in<00:04:50.080> chamber<00:04:50.409> music<00:04:50.440> because<00:04:51.009> I<00:04:51.129> want<00:04:51.310> to<00:04:51.400> make

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:51.520 
in chamber music because I want to make

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:54.420 
in chamber music because I want to make
the<00:04:51.639> day<00:04:51.789> slides<00:04:52.090> very<00:04:52.810> very<00:04:53.080> very<00:04:53.169> clean<00:04:53.530> and

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:54.430 
the day slides very very very clean and

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:56.610 
the day slides very very very clean and
then<00:04:54.699> back<00:04:54.879> to<00:04:55.180> this<00:04:55.360> to<00:04:56.080> these<00:04:56.259> positions

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:56.620 
then back to this to these positions

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:58.529 
then back to this to these positions
here<00:04:57.340> for<00:04:57.610> the<00:04:57.699> person<00:04:58.150> there<00:04:58.300> is<00:04:58.330> the

00:04:58.529 --> 00:04:58.539 
here for the person there is the

00:04:58.539 --> 00:05:01.230 
here for the person there is the
question<00:04:58.990> if<00:04:59.949> this<00:05:00.129> is<00:05:00.280> hard<00:05:00.550> to<00:05:00.729> reach<00:05:00.970> with

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:01.240 
question if this is hard to reach with

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:04.459 
question if this is hard to reach with

00:05:13.629 --> 00:05:13.639 

00:05:13.639 --> 00:05:16.210 

see<00:05:14.539> I<00:05:14.569> can<00:05:14.870> stretch<00:05:15.139> it<00:05:15.169> with<00:05:15.500> my<00:05:15.680> thumb<00:05:15.919> back

see I can stretch it with my thumb back
here<00:05:17.889> but<00:05:18.889> maybe<00:05:19.099> not<00:05:19.340> everybody<00:05:19.789> kept<00:05:20.030> that's

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:20.300 
here but maybe not everybody kept that's

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:25.059 
here but maybe not everybody kept that's
fine<00:05:22.599> I'm<00:05:23.599> sure<00:05:23.990> that<00:05:24.229> position<00:05:24.650> was<00:05:24.770> probably

00:05:25.059 --> 00:05:25.069 
fine I'm sure that position was probably

00:05:25.069 --> 00:05:29.649 
fine I'm sure that position was probably
accessible<00:05:26.979> to<00:05:27.979> most<00:05:28.159> chalice<00:05:28.669> at<00:05:29.270> the<00:05:29.419> very
