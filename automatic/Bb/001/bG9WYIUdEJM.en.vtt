00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:55.630 
believe we're used to but it's batter

and stubbier

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:58.890 
and stubbier
most<00:02:57.220> likely<00:02:57.610> due<00:02:57.849> to<00:02:58.030> the<00:02:58.120> batteries<00:02:58.599> okay

00:02:58.890 --> 00:02:58.900 
most likely due to the batteries okay

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:00.660 
most likely due to the batteries okay
when<00:02:59.410> you<00:02:59.500> open<00:02:59.739> it<00:02:59.769> up<00:02:59.920> and<00:03:00.190> some<00:03:00.310> batteries

when you open it up and some batteries

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:02.880 
when you open it up and some batteries
in<00:03:00.819> there<00:03:01.049> okay<00:03:02.049> just<00:03:02.349> like<00:03:02.500> with<00:03:02.650> the<00:03:02.739> other

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:02.890 
in there okay just like with the other

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:05.460 
in there okay just like with the other
engines<00:03:03.220> it's<00:03:03.880> going<00:03:04.090> to<00:03:04.180> take<00:03:04.330> to<00:03:04.569> triple-a

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:05.470 
engines it's going to take to triple-a

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:09.000

batteries<00:03:06.099> on<00:03:06.400> the<00:03:06.459> internal<00:03:07.329> like<00:03:08.260> that<00:03:08.620> and

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.010 
batteries on the internal like that and

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:12.569 
batteries on the internal like that and
as<00:03:09.400> you<00:03:09.549> can<00:03:09.730> see<00:03:10.170> the<00:03:11.170> inside<00:03:11.590> cavity<00:03:11.920> now

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:12.579 
as you can see the inside cavity now

00:03:12.579 --> 00:03:14.100 
as you can see the inside cavity now
here's<00:03:12.910> one<00:03:13.120> thing<00:03:13.269> I<00:03:13.420> didn't<00:03:13.660> notice<00:03:13.900> on<00:03:14.019> the

other abuse but I took a good look at
the<00:03:16.780> date<00:03:17.079> the<00:03:17.890> date<00:03:18.160> on<00:03:18.430> this<00:03:18.700> engine<00:03:19.030> is<00:03:19.920> 2013

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:21.329 
the date the date on this engine is 2013

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:24.330 
the date the date on this engine is 2013
okay<00:03:22.500> 2013<00:03:23.500> so<00:03:23.650> they've<00:03:23.769> been<00:03:23.890> working<00:03:24.250> on

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:24.340 
okay 2013 so they've been working on

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:30.020 
okay 2013 so they've been working on
these<00:03:24.459> for<00:03:24.519> a<00:03:24.790> while<00:03:25.440> this<00:03:26.440> is<00:03:26.620> cycle<00:03:27.040> okay

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:30.030 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:33.230

this<00:05:48.779> one<00:05:48.990> of<00:05:49.110> course<00:05:49.139> is<00:05:49.529> much<00:05:49.800> lighter<00:05:50.099> even

00:05:50.779 --> 00:05:50.789 
this one of course is much lighter even

00:05:50.789 --> 00:05:52.429

than<00:05:50.939> a<00:05:51.000> patchwork<00:05:51.270> yu-er<00:05:51.900> which<00:05:52.139> I<00:05:52.259> thought

00:05:52.429 --> 00:05:52.439 
than a patchwork yu-er which I thought

00:05:52.439 --> 00:05:54.110 
than a patchwork yu-er which I thought
was<00:05:52.590> going<00:05:52.740> to<00:05:52.800> be<00:05:52.860> very<00:05:53.099> light<00:05:53.400> but<00:05:53.969> the

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:54.120 
was going to be very light but the

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:56.300 
was going to be very light but the
poplar<00:05:54.539> key<00:05:54.750> role<00:05:54.990> takes<00:05:55.289> up<00:05:55.500> seat<00:05:55.860> batteries

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:56.310 
poplar key role takes up seat batteries

00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:59.209 
poplar key role takes up seat batteries
that's<00:05:56.610> another<00:05:57.090> reason<00:05:57.360> why<00:05:57.629> is<00:05:57.689> you<00:05:58.219> know

00:05:59.209 --> 00:05:59.219 
that's another reason why is you know

00:05:59.219 --> 00:06:03.890 
that's another reason why is you know
heavier<00:05:59.930> so<00:06:00.930> but<00:06:01.770> okay<00:06:02.240> where<00:06:03.240> is<00:06:03.419> that<00:06:03.449> one

00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:03.900 
heavier so but okay where is that one

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:05.240 
heavier so but okay where is that one
and<00:06:04.080> let's<00:06:04.259> put<00:06:04.500> them<00:06:04.590> on<00:06:04.680> track<00:06:04.860> and<00:06:05.069> have

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:05.250 
and let's put them on track and have

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:08.709 
and let's put them on track and have
money<00:06:05.520> all<00:06:05.849> right
