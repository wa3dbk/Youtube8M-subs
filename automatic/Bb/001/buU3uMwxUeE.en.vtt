reflection of the Sun showing the inside
of<00:00:15.240> it<00:00:15.360> I<00:00:15.650> wanted<00:00:16.650> to<00:00:17.330> show<00:00:18.330> a<00:00:18.359> little<00:00:18.570> bit<00:00:18.690> more

of it I wanted to show a little bit more
of<00:00:19.910> the<00:00:20.910> range<00:00:21.210> of<00:00:21.570> the<00:00:22.289> putty<00:00:22.529> that<00:00:22.769> I<00:00:22.830> put<00:00:23.070> on

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
of the range of the putty that I put on

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.120 
of the range of the putty that I put on
the<00:00:23.310> inside<00:00:24.289> so<00:00:25.289> that<00:00:25.410> I<00:00:25.529> could<00:00:25.590> work<00:00:25.830> on<00:00:25.980> those

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
the inside so that I could work on those

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.810 
the inside so that I could work on those
crevices<00:00:27.800> in<00:00:28.800> the<00:00:28.920> other<00:00:29.039> video<00:00:29.369> I<00:00:29.460> didn't

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
this type of work so wasn't about the

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.319 
this type of work so wasn't about the
money<00:00:46.469> for<00:00:46.680> me<00:00:46.829> it<00:00:47.039> was<00:00:47.100> more<00:00:47.309> about<00:00:47.460> the<00:00:47.820> the

real<00:00:54.090> weak<00:00:54.329> one<00:00:54.930> of<00:00:55.050> them<00:00:55.170> actually<00:00:55.320> caved<00:00:55.710> in

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
real weak one of them actually caved in

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.619 
real weak one of them actually caved in
after<00:00:56.280> i<00:00:56.340> had<00:00:56.489> worked<00:00:56.730> on<00:00:56.879> it<00:00:57.000> a<00:00:57.059> little<00:00:57.180> bit<00:00:57.390> so

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
real good built a putty up a little bit

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.289 
real good built a putty up a little bit
higher<00:01:06.659> so<00:01:06.960> that<00:01:07.670> when<00:01:08.670> i<00:01:08.700> drove<00:01:09.030> through<00:01:09.270> on

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
higher so that when i drove through on

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:12.469 
higher so that when i drove through on
the<00:01:09.479> other<00:01:09.630> side<00:01:09.900> i<00:01:09.930> can<00:01:10.290> have<00:01:10.470> a<00:01:11.150> molded<00:01:12.150> area

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
the other side i can have a molded area

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:18.649 
the other side i can have a molded area
on<00:01:13.200> this<00:01:13.409> one<00:01:13.850> actually<00:01:15.110> from<00:01:16.110> the<00:01:16.200> inside<00:01:17.659> put

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
on this one actually from the inside put

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.370 
on this one actually from the inside put
it<00:01:18.780> in<00:01:18.869> while<00:01:19.110> it<00:01:19.259> was<00:01:19.380> while<00:01:19.890> it<00:01:19.979> was<00:01:20.100> fresh<00:01:20.310> I

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:21.380 
it in while it was while it was fresh I

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:23.780 
it in while it was while it was fresh I
you<00:01:22.380> know<00:01:22.409> I'd<00:01:22.590> sanded<00:01:23.009> that<00:01:23.130> whole<00:01:23.310> area<00:01:23.549> from

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
you know I'd sanded that whole area from

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.370 
you know I'd sanded that whole area from
the<00:01:23.850> inside<00:01:24.240> so<00:01:24.540> that<00:01:24.630> the<00:01:24.750> putty<00:01:24.990> would<00:01:25.170> bond

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
the inside so that the putty would bond

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.289 
the inside so that the putty would bond
with<00:01:25.530> it<00:01:25.740> and<00:01:25.950> then<00:01:26.610> on<00:01:26.759> the<00:01:26.880> other<00:01:26.909> side<00:01:27.270> i

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
with it and then on the other side i

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:31.390 
with it and then on the other side i
went<00:01:27.570> ahead<00:01:27.659> and<00:01:27.840> i<00:01:27.990> used<00:01:28.259> a<00:01:28.939> throat<00:01:29.990> thing

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:31.400 
went ahead and i used a throat thing

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:35.090 
went ahead and i used a throat thing
that<00:01:32.400> they<00:01:32.990> use<00:01:33.990> at<00:01:34.170> the<00:01:34.200> doctor's<00:01:34.650> office<00:01:34.770> and

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
that they use at the doctor's office and

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.679 
that they use at the doctor's office and
I<00:01:35.970> use<00:01:36.210> that<00:01:36.240> to<00:01:37.189> actually<00:01:38.189> sculpt<00:01:38.850> the<00:01:39.299> area

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
I use that to actually sculpt the area

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:43.880 
I use that to actually sculpt the area
on<00:01:40.560> the<00:01:40.770> outside<00:01:41.189> which<00:01:42.320> as<00:01:43.320> you<00:01:43.500> can<00:01:43.590> see<00:01:43.680> I

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
on the outside which as you can see I

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.880 
on the outside which as you can see I
could<00:01:44.700> only<00:01:44.790> get<00:01:45.030> so<00:01:45.210> far<00:01:45.240> in<00:01:45.720> there<00:01:45.930> and<00:01:46.140> then

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
could only get so far in there and then

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.370 
could only get so far in there and then
I'm<00:01:47.579> going<00:01:47.700> to<00:01:47.790> go<00:01:47.939> back<00:01:48.149> in<00:01:48.390> with<00:01:48.420> some<00:01:49.170> fine

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
I'm going to go back in with some fine

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.950 
I'm going to go back in with some fine
detail<00:01:50.090> Jermel<00:01:51.090> tools<00:01:51.299> and<00:01:51.600> I'm<00:01:51.659> gonna<00:01:51.750> clean
