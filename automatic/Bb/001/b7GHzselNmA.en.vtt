state well it's a good question because
remember<00:01:49.800> you're<00:01:49.920> very<00:01:50.099> much<00:01:50.220> from<00:01:50.399> the

00:01:50.419 --> 00:01:50.429 
remember you're very much from the

00:01:50.429 --> 00:01:51.979 
remember you're very much from the
outside<00:01:50.880> looking<00:01:51.239> in<00:01:51.360> so<00:01:51.630> I<00:01:51.660> can<00:01:51.750> only

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:51.989 
outside looking in so I can only

00:01:51.989 --> 00:01:54.320 
outside looking in so I can only
conjecture<00:01:52.229> but<00:01:53.190> I<00:01:53.550> used<00:01:53.849> to<00:01:53.940> put<00:01:54.090> trained

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:54.330 
conjecture but I used to put trained

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:56.510 
conjecture but I used to put trained
horses<00:01:54.690> for<00:01:54.840> a<00:01:54.869> living<00:01:55.170> and<00:01:55.349> what<00:01:55.979> Betsy<00:01:56.340> did

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
horses for a living and what Betsy did

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.820 
horses for a living and what Betsy did
was<00:01:56.940> she<00:01:57.090> lowered<00:01:57.420> her<00:01:57.539> head<00:01:57.569> to<00:01:57.989> him<00:01:58.170> in<00:01:58.379> this

00:01:58.820 --> 00:01:58.830 
was she lowered her head to him in this

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:01.279 
was she lowered her head to him in this
very<00:01:59.069> submissive<00:01:59.340> gesture<00:02:00.239> which<00:02:00.420> as<00:02:00.629> a<00:02:00.660> horse

00:02:01.279 --> 00:02:01.289 
very submissive gesture which as a horse

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:03.260 
very submissive gesture which as a horse
trainer<00:02:01.590> you<00:02:01.860> learn<00:02:02.039> to<00:02:02.190> recognize<00:02:02.340> I'd<00:02:03.000> never

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
trainer you learn to recognize I'd never

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.570 
trainer you learn to recognize I'd never
seen<00:02:03.479> a<00:02:03.509> horse<00:02:03.720> spontaneously<00:02:04.440> do<00:02:04.739> this<00:02:04.950> to<00:02:05.550> a

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:05.580 
seen a horse spontaneously do this to a

seen a horse spontaneously do this to a
human<00:02:05.940> before<00:02:06.270> and<00:02:06.509> I<00:02:06.599> realized<00:02:07.080> that<00:02:07.259> they

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:07.410 
human before and I realized that they

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:09.770 
human before and I realized that they
had<00:02:07.619> some<00:02:08.459> kind<00:02:08.729> of<00:02:08.789> direct<00:02:09.239> connection

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
had some kind of direct connection

had some kind of direct connection
initially<00:02:10.770> I<00:02:10.800> came<00:02:10.890> to<00:02:11.220> the<00:02:11.310> wrong<00:02:11.430> conclusion

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
initially I came to the wrong conclusion

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:14.150 
initially I came to the wrong conclusion
and<00:02:12.209> thought<00:02:12.660> oh<00:02:12.810> he's<00:02:12.989> got<00:02:13.230> the<00:02:13.680> horse<00:02:13.830> gene

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 
and thought oh he's got the horse gene

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.400 
and thought oh he's got the horse gene
he's<00:02:14.370> like<00:02:14.819> me<00:02:15.030> but<00:02:15.690> I'll<00:02:15.840> never<00:02:16.020> share<00:02:16.230> it

the body to produce oxytocin which is

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:18.440 
the body to produce oxytocin which is
the<00:03:16.319> feel-good<00:03:16.620> hormone<00:03:17.130> so<00:03:17.730> I<00:03:18.090> think<00:03:18.150> if<00:03:18.390> you

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
the feel-good hormone so I think if you

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:20.120 
the feel-good hormone so I think if you
combine<00:03:18.660> all<00:03:19.019> those<00:03:19.140> things<00:03:19.440> together<00:03:19.620> plus

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:20.130 
combine all those things together plus

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:21.949 
combine all those things together plus
just<00:03:20.670> how<00:03:20.849> cool<00:03:21.120> it<00:03:21.269> is<00:03:21.329> to<00:03:21.450> be<00:03:21.540> on<00:03:21.630> the<00:03:21.720> back<00:03:21.840> of

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:21.959 
just how cool it is to be on the back of

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:24.559 
just how cool it is to be on the back of
a<00:03:22.019> horse<00:03:22.140> you've<00:03:22.860> got<00:03:23.040> a<00:03:23.069> potent<00:03:23.459> cocktail<00:03:23.640> for
