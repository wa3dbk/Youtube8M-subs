00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:18.910
 181 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:32.430
 and friends but 181.6 pounds you have to 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.370
 mention that they say a charge so 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:40.920
 both each weight less than the week 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:45.059
 last point 4 this is almost half a pound 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:47.390
 but I feel and I look more cleaner 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:50.730
 leaner besides that because yesterday with my 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:53.309
 800 grams of carbohydrates in my load 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:57.900
 so then it's fine it's fine or not 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:01:00.119
 I feel bad is the scale the 

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:03.299
 scale says I'm weighing less than 

00:01:00.119 --> 00:01:06.900
 last week so we go well as 

00:01:03.299 --> 00:01:10.000
 they are friends here luÃ­s for j the fitness 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:12.340
 with the poses of week number four 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.370
 you decide to pose in the gym of a 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:18.280
 different lighting but you can 

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:22.030
 appreciate better much much better than in 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:24.790
 my room is much better than my 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:28.450
 fourth and also 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:31.030
 as we can see the progress I've had 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:33.700
 during these four weeks it is notorious 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:36.340
 although I look a little more defined 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:40.210
 I feel like I'm losing size 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:41.590
 little in size but normal is normal 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:43.690
 when in court on stage 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:47.890
 definition and we can see the poses 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:51.390
 relaxed lateral fronts and 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:55.960
 back and then here we have the first 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:58.330
 double visor chat in front already looks 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:00.580
 a little more decent than last week 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:04.330
 you can already see a little further with a 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:06.550
 little more defined not much but there goes and 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:08.789
 here we have expansion of numbers of 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:11.519
 front 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:13.260
 it also looks a lot better than 

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:15.480
 last week as you can see below my 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:18.599
 pectorals I'm losing fat that is 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:20.069
 it was a part where last week it 

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:23.250
 I could see that he still had accumulated fat 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:24.599
 there but you can already see that in this 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:29.480
 I've lost it week 

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:35.299
 here we have lateral pectorals 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:36.709
 and lateral triceps also here 

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:40.620
 you can see that you are starting to see a 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:44.190
 little bit more defined pecs 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:46.860
 a little bit better in the poses a 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:49.950
 little not much because I have to practice 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:52.110
 even more as you can see my back 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:53.940
 low you also start to see that you no longer 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:55.960
 there is a lot of fat as in the 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:58.600
 first two weeks 

00:02:55.960 --> 00:03:00.790
 but there is still a little 

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:02.290
 here we have expansion of numbers of 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:05.890
 back 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:08.920
 and I feel if I feel a little boy 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:10.750
 seeing me in the video but not really 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:13.480
 I feel like a boy, I do not feel that 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:14.950
 be that it is putting me slim seat 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:17.230
 definition but I do not feel that it's 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:19.120
 losing a lot of weight because we are going very 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:20.709
 gradually 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:22.140
 nothing more than the force I'm 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:25.590
 conserving 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:27.540
 if we have sad of the left side and 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:28.819
 then this pose 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:31.189
 what 

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:34.489
 I like it a lot and we have more 

00:03:31.189 --> 00:03:36.469
 muscular here with the right leg of 

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:39.109
 left front of left 

00:03:36.469 --> 00:03:42.769
 front and then we have the right and with 

00:03:39.109 --> 00:03:45.319
 right front and good is abdomen 

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:48.170
 in front and it would be the last one has the 

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:50.180
 penultimate pose that would do and start 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:52.250
 read a bit there though squeeze and 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:54.769
 squeeze but there he dances 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:56.719
 we are seeing results little by little not 

00:03:54.769 --> 00:03:59.749
 we want this to do it very very fast 

00:03:56.719 --> 00:04:02.120
 but we're doing very well here last pose that 

00:03:59.749 --> 00:04:05.139
 it's one of my favorites and well that's 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:05.139
 all for now friends
