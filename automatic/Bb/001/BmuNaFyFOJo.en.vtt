00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:53.790 
shot a section of March video and when
we<00:00:52.210> reviewed<00:00:52.690> it<00:00:52.809> which<00:00:52.960> he<00:00:53.079> definitely

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:53.800 
we reviewed it which he definitely

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:56.010 
we reviewed it which he definitely
always<00:00:54.129> do<00:00:54.309> move<00:00:54.550> your<00:00:54.910> footage<00:00:55.210> we<00:00:55.629> found<00:00:55.660> out

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:56.020 
always do move your footage we found out

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:57.600 
always do move your footage we found out
that<00:00:56.110> it<00:00:56.230> was<00:00:56.320> blurry<00:00:56.620> and<00:00:56.739> it's<00:00:57.399> blurry

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:57.610 
that it was blurry and it's blurry

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:00.000 
that it was blurry and it's blurry
because<00:00:57.789> I<00:00:58.379> focused<00:00:59.379> everything<00:00:59.620> was<00:00:59.800> flying

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:00.010 
because I focused everything was flying

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:02.959 
because I focused everything was flying
and<00:01:00.399> then<00:01:00.760> I<00:01:00.789> hit<00:01:01.030> a<00:01:01.059> button<00:01:01.270> with<00:01:01.600> that

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
and then I hit a button with that

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.280 
and then I hit a button with that
recalculated<00:01:03.969> the<00:01:04.269> exposure<00:01:04.720> or<00:01:05.019> whatever

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:05.290 
recalculated the exposure or whatever

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:07.140 
recalculated the exposure or whatever
and<00:01:05.619> when<00:01:05.799> it<00:01:05.890> did<00:01:06.100> that<00:01:06.280> I<00:01:06.310> focused<00:01:06.850> on<00:01:06.939> the

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:07.150 
and when it did that I focused on the

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:09.149 
and when it did that I focused on the
background<00:01:07.630> and<00:01:08.020> then<00:01:08.260> they<00:01:08.439> offset<00:01:08.740> this

00:01:09.149 --> 00:01:09.159 
background and then they offset this

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:12.240 
background and then they offset this
focal<00:01:10.030> length<00:01:10.210> blurry<00:01:10.630> so<00:01:11.229> we<00:01:11.770> reached<00:01:12.070> off

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:12.250 
focal length blurry so we reached off

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:14.490 
focal length blurry so we reached off
