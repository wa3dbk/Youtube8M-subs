desperation shot you try to get over

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.039 
desperation shot you try to get over
your<00:01:16.530> opponent's<00:01:17.100> head<00:01:17.250> so<00:01:17.790> that<00:01:18.060> it<00:01:18.600> doesn't

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
your opponent's head so that it doesn't

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:20.450 
your opponent's head so that it doesn't
have<00:01:19.140> any<00:01:19.290> spin<00:01:19.650> but<00:01:19.890> you<00:01:19.979> have<00:01:20.100> a<00:01:20.130> lot<00:01:20.310> of

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
have any spin but you have a lot of

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.399 
have any spin but you have a lot of
control<00:01:20.850> over<00:01:20.880> it<00:01:21.270> you<00:01:21.450> hit<00:01:21.570> it<00:01:21.689> very<00:01:21.720> high<00:01:22.110> but

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
control over it you hit it very high but

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.890 
control over it you hit it very high but
when<00:01:22.590> it<00:01:22.740> bounces<00:01:23.220> it<00:01:23.640> takes<00:01:23.909> a<00:01:24.060> very<00:01:24.570> lazy

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
when it bounces it takes a very lazy

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.200 
when it bounces it takes a very lazy
bounce<00:01:25.350> it<00:01:25.619> bounces<00:01:25.979> almost<00:01:26.280> straight<00:01:26.640> up<00:01:26.670> so

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
bounce it bounces almost straight up so

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.410 
bounce it bounces almost straight up so
often<00:01:27.900> a<00:01:28.350> net<00:01:28.740> man<00:01:28.920> can<00:01:29.189> run<00:01:29.430> back<00:01:29.670> and<00:01:29.729> get<00:01:30.180> a

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
often a net man can run back and get a

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.990 
often a net man can run back and get a
defensive<00:01:31.170> lob<00:01:31.320> after<00:01:31.890> it<00:01:32.009> bounces<00:01:32.400> but<00:01:32.880> the

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
defensive lob after it bounces but the

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.109 
defensive lob after it bounces but the
key<00:01:33.150> is<00:01:33.329> to<00:01:33.479> try<00:01:33.659> to<00:01:33.720> make<00:01:33.990> them<00:01:34.229> run<00:01:34.560> back<00:01:34.799> and

00:01:35.109 --> 00:01:35.119 
key is to try to make them run back and

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:37.249 
key is to try to make them run back and
hit<00:01:36.119> a<00:01:36.150> ball<00:01:36.390> when<00:01:36.780> they're<00:01:36.960> running

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
hit a ball when they're running

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.770 
hit a ball when they're running
backwards<00:01:37.770> rather<00:01:38.310> than<00:01:38.640> having<00:01:39.270> them<00:01:39.479> hit<00:01:39.689> an

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
backwards rather than having them hit an

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.690 
backwards rather than having them hit an
overhead<00:01:40.170> so<00:01:40.590> a<00:01:40.619> lob<00:01:40.920> you<00:01:41.130> want<00:01:41.310> to<00:01:41.400> get<00:01:41.520> over

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
overhead so a lob you want to get over

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.240 
overhead so a lob you want to get over
your<00:01:41.970> opponent's<00:01:42.509> head<00:01:42.829> think<00:01:43.829> twice<00:01:44.220> about

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
your opponent's head think twice about

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.280 
your opponent's head think twice about
hitting<00:01:45.000> loves<00:01:45.270> from<00:01:45.659> the<00:01:45.840> middle<00:01:46.110> of<00:01:46.229> the

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
hitting loves from the middle of the

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.620 
hitting loves from the middle of the
court<00:01:46.649> if<00:01:47.009> you<00:01:47.070> happen<00:01:47.610> to<00:01:47.640> hit<00:01:47.909> a<00:01:47.939> poor<00:01:48.329> lob

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
court if you happen to hit a poor lob

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.289 
court if you happen to hit a poor lob
you<00:01:49.350> might<00:01:49.560> want<00:01:49.950> to<00:01:50.009> check<00:01:50.250> how<00:01:50.520> paid-up<00:01:50.939> your

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
you might want to check how paid-up your

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:54.080 
you might want to check how paid-up your
life<00:01:51.479> insurances<00:01:52.200> so<00:01:52.829> usually<00:01:53.610> you'll<00:01:53.820> use

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
life insurances so usually you'll use
