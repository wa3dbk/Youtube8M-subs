00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:31.070 
one of the technique that you really

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:32.949 
one of the technique that you really
have<00:02:31.250> to<00:02:31.280> work<00:02:31.610> into<00:02:31.940> your<00:02:32.090> routine<00:02:32.450> is<00:02:32.690> about

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.090 
better absorption and also after you do

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:45.970 
better absorption and also after you do
a<00:02:44.120> thin<00:02:44.420> layer<00:02:44.630> that's<00:02:45.110> when<00:02:45.380> you<00:02:45.530> know<00:02:45.709> if

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:45.980 
a thin layer that's when you know if

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:48.070 
a thin layer that's when you know if
your<00:02:46.130> face<00:02:46.370> feel<00:02:46.700> moisturizing<00:02:47.540> up<00:02:47.720> and

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:50.240 
that's when you decide if you want to

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:54.340 
that's when you decide if you want to
add<00:02:50.450> another<00:02:50.780> layer<00:02:51.400> um<00:02:52.400> so<00:02:52.910> it's<00:02:53.630> a<00:02:53.750> layering

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:54.350
