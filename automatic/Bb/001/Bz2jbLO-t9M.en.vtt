one<00:00:48.570> appears<00:00:48.930> to<00:00:49.020> be<00:00:49.110> the<00:00:49.200> device<00:00:49.440> we<00:00:49.620> see<00:00:49.770> in

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
one appears to be the device we see in

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.639 
one appears to be the device we see in
front<00:00:50.010> of<00:00:50.160> us<00:00:50.219> now<00:00:51.180> I've<00:00:51.539> seen<00:00:51.989> this<00:00:52.110> device<00:00:52.260> on

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
front of us now I've seen this device on

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.590 
front of us now I've seen this device on
future<00:00:53.489> weapons<00:00:53.730> i<00:00:53.789> cant<00:00:53.969> rember<00:00:54.090> exact<00:00:54.449> name

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
future weapons i cant rember exact name

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.750 
future weapons i cant rember exact name
but<00:00:54.780> basically<00:00:55.050> the<00:00:55.920> text<00:00:56.190> target<00:00:56.460> shoot<00:00:56.670> a

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
but basically the text target shoot a

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.040 
but basically the text target shoot a
little<00:00:56.820> thing<00:00:57.120> up<00:00:57.210> in<00:00:57.300> the<00:00:57.390> air<00:00:57.510> which<00:00:57.690> spins

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
little thing up in the air which spins

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.479 
little thing up in the air which spins
round<00:00:58.289> and<00:00:58.559> then<00:00:58.680> explodes<00:00:59.280> and<00:00:59.430> fires

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
round and then explodes and fires

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.340 
round and then explodes and fires
shrapnel<00:01:00.059> towards<00:01:00.329> that<00:01:00.480> target<00:01:00.809> so<00:01:01.199> I<00:01:01.230> think

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
shrapnel towards that target so I think

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.349 
shrapnel towards that target so I think
it's<00:01:01.590> sort<00:01:01.859> of<00:01:01.920> like<00:01:01.980> a<00:01:02.070> claymore<00:01:02.370> except

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
it's sort of like a claymore except

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:04.640 
it's sort of like a claymore except
maybe<00:01:03.449> it<00:01:03.570> does<00:01:03.660> a<00:01:03.719> lot<00:01:03.809> more<00:01:03.930> damage<00:01:04.140> or<00:01:04.470> maybe

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
maybe it does a lot more damage or maybe

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:05.780 
maybe it does a lot more damage or maybe
it<00:01:04.769> can<00:01:04.890> kill<00:01:05.040> multiple<00:01:05.189> targets<00:01:05.670> or

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
it can kill multiple targets or

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.340 
it can kill multiple targets or
something<00:01:06.210> like<00:01:06.270> that<00:01:06.360> I'm<00:01:06.990> not<00:01:07.140> quite<00:01:07.320> sure

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
something like that I'm not quite sure

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.070 
something like that I'm not quite sure
but<00:01:07.979> that<00:01:08.400> would<00:01:08.580> that<00:01:09.030> be<00:01:09.090> quite<00:01:09.450> cool<00:01:09.689> and

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
but that would that be quite cool and

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.179 
but that would that be quite cool and
then<00:01:10.320> we<00:01:10.380> could<00:01:10.470> do<00:01:10.530> the<00:01:10.619> predator<00:01:10.950> missile

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
then we could do the predator missile

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:12.260 
then we could do the predator missile
which<00:01:11.340> I<00:01:11.430> think<00:01:11.549> we<00:01:11.610> all<00:01:11.640> expected<00:01:12.060> to<00:01:12.150> see<00:01:12.240> in

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
which I think we all expected to see in

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:13.609 
which I think we all expected to see in
water<00:01:12.450> play<00:01:12.600> again<00:01:12.780> and<00:01:12.990> the<00:01:13.020> final<00:01:13.170> streak

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
water play again and the final streak

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:14.870 
water play again and the final streak
which<00:01:13.740> is<00:01:13.860> juggernaut<00:01:14.280> which<00:01:14.520> of<00:01:14.640> course<00:01:14.670> we

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
which is juggernaut which of course we

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.240 
which is juggernaut which of course we
will<00:01:14.970> see<00:01:15.150> later<00:01:15.330> in<00:01:16.020> this<00:01:16.049> play<00:01:16.710> in<00:01:17.159> this

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
will see later in this play in this

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.039 
will see later in this play in this
video<00:01:17.520> now<00:01:18.000> we<00:01:18.060> also<00:01:18.390> see<00:01:18.570> equipment<00:01:18.780> down

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
video now we also see equipment down

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.710 
video now we also see equipment down
there<00:01:19.729> the<00:01:20.729> equipment<00:01:21.030> we<00:01:21.090> can<00:01:21.210> see<00:01:21.360> is<00:01:21.479> a

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
there the equipment we can see is a

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.749 
there the equipment we can see is a
flash<00:01:22.140> or<00:01:22.380> a<00:01:22.590> splash<00:01:23.040> bang<00:01:23.220> or<00:01:23.369> stun<00:01:23.549> grenade

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
flash or a splash bang or stun grenade

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:26.510 
flash or a splash bang or stun grenade
and<00:01:23.909> some<00:01:24.750> sort<00:01:25.020> of<00:01:25.080> lethal<00:01:25.500> we<00:01:25.619> assume<00:01:25.890> it

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
and some sort of lethal we assume it

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.130 
and some sort of lethal we assume it
appears<00:01:27.000> that<00:01:27.060> up<00:01:27.299> on<00:01:27.450> the<00:01:27.540> d-pad<00:01:27.689> for

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
appears that up on the d-pad for

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:29.990 
appears that up on the d-pad for
equipment<00:01:28.500> is<00:01:28.710> going<00:01:28.740> away<00:01:29.100> as<00:01:29.520> it<00:01:29.790> is<00:01:29.880> in

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
equipment is going away as it is in

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.580 
equipment is going away as it is in
black<00:01:30.090> ops<00:01:30.329> but<00:01:30.900> what<00:01:31.020> this<00:01:31.140> does<00:01:31.350> mean<00:01:31.530> I

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
black ops but what this does mean I

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:32.810 
black ops but what this does mean I
believe<00:01:31.770> and<00:01:32.280> this<00:01:32.369> is<00:01:32.460> just<00:01:32.520> a<00:01:32.640> speculation

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
believe and this is just a speculation

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.969 
believe and this is just a speculation
on<00:01:33.119> my<00:01:33.240> part<00:01:33.270> is<00:01:33.600> that<00:01:33.990> this<00:01:34.320> leaves<00:01:34.560> both<00:01:34.770> the

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
on my part is that this leaves both the

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:38.090 
on my part is that this leaves both the
up<00:01:35.189> and<00:01:35.400> down<00:01:35.880> keys<00:01:36.659> on<00:01:36.780> the<00:01:36.810> d-pad<00:01:37.020> free<00:01:37.500> which

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
up and down keys on the d-pad free which

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.950 
up and down keys on the d-pad free which
means<00:01:38.400> that<00:01:38.610> the<00:01:39.119> ability<00:01:39.420> to<00:01:39.540> cycle<00:01:39.930> through

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
means that the ability to cycle through

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.630 
means that the ability to cycle through
killstreak<00:01:40.619> seems<00:01:40.860> very<00:01:41.009> likely<00:01:41.130> especially

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
killstreak seems very likely especially

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:42.830 
killstreak seems very likely especially
considering<00:01:42.180> the<00:01:42.240> layout<00:01:42.450> in<00:01:42.540> the<00:01:42.600> bottom

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
considering the layout in the bottom

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.240 
considering the layout in the bottom
left<00:01:43.020> button<00:01:43.200> right<00:01:43.710> it<00:01:43.799> would<00:01:43.890> not<00:01:44.100> surprise

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
left button right it would not surprise

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:45.560 
left button right it would not surprise
me<00:01:44.460> if<00:01:44.670> you<00:01:44.729> could<00:01:44.880> press<00:01:45.000> the<00:01:45.210> up<00:01:45.299> and<00:01:45.420> down

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
me if you could press the up and down

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.330 
me if you could press the up and down
arrows<00:01:45.840> to<00:01:45.990> go<00:01:46.470> through<00:01:46.740> those<00:01:46.860> killstreaks

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
arrows to go through those killstreaks

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.330 
arrows to go through those killstreaks
at<00:01:47.520> will<00:01:47.880> other<00:01:48.750> details<00:01:49.170> we<00:01:49.409> see<00:01:49.680> the<00:01:49.799> ACR<00:01:50.159> we

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
at will other details we see the ACR we

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.819 
at will other details we see the ACR we
see<00:01:50.490> we're<00:01:50.640> in<00:01:50.670> some<00:01:50.909> sort<00:01:51.060> of<00:01:51.619> Middle<00:01:52.619> Eastern

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
see we're in some sort of Middle Eastern

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.380 
see we're in some sort of Middle Eastern
setting<00:01:53.220> and<00:01:53.369> that's<00:01:53.820> pretty<00:01:53.970> much<00:01:54.090> volts

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
setting and that's pretty much volts

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:55.789 
setting and that's pretty much volts
let's<00:01:54.540> get<00:01:54.659> this<00:01:54.720> video<00:01:54.990> going<00:01:55.229> into<00:01:55.710> what

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
let's get this video going into what

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:57.859 
let's get this video going into what
happens<00:01:56.100> so<00:01:56.280> here<00:01:56.610> we're<00:01:57.240> about<00:01:57.450> to<00:01:57.630> see

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
happens so here we're about to see

00:01:57.869 --> 00:01:59.719 
happens so here we're about to see
that's<00:01:58.680> my<00:01:58.829> video<00:01:59.070> buffers<00:01:59.369> it<00:01:59.460> work<00:01:59.549> for<00:01:59.670> you

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
that's my video buffers it work for you

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.789 
that's my video buffers it work for you
obviously<00:01:59.820> we<00:02:00.600> see<00:02:00.719> and<00:02:00.869> pull<00:02:00.960> out<00:02:01.020> the<00:02:01.200> fmg9

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
obviously we see and pull out the fmg9

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:05.319 
obviously we see and pull out the fmg9
the<00:02:02.189> fmg9<00:02:02.490> is<00:02:03.060> a<00:02:03.090> weapon<00:02:03.450> made<00:02:03.990> i<00:02:04.020> believe<00:02:04.530> by

00:02:05.319 --> 00:02:05.329 
the fmg9 is a weapon made i believe by

00:02:05.329 --> 00:02:07.940 
the fmg9 is a weapon made i believe by
magpul<00:02:06.329> i<00:02:06.479> may<00:02:06.899> be<00:02:06.960> wrong<00:02:07.049> there<00:02:07.320> and

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
magpul i may be wrong there and

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.680 
magpul i may be wrong there and
basically<00:02:08.129> it's<00:02:08.399> this<00:02:08.489> little<00:02:08.580> torch<00:02:09.360> that's

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
basically it's this little torch that's

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.869 
basically it's this little torch that's
also<00:02:09.959> a<00:02:09.989> machine<00:02:10.619> pistol<00:02:10.920> it's<00:02:11.160> not<00:02:11.520> really

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879 
also a machine pistol it's not really

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:13.630 
also a machine pistol it's not really
appropriate<00:02:11.970> for<00:02:12.390> any<00:02:12.450> sort<00:02:12.660> of<00:02:12.750> war<00:02:12.959> but<00:02:13.290> I

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640 
appropriate for any sort of war but I

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:15.700 
appropriate for any sort of war but I
yes<00:02:13.760> they<00:02:14.030> just<00:02:14.060> did<00:02:14.390> it<00:02:14.540> to<00:02:14.569> look<00:02:14.720> fancy<00:02:15.080> so

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:15.710 
yes they just did it to look fancy so

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:18.400 
yes they just did it to look fancy so
let's<00:02:15.860> keep<00:02:15.980> going<00:02:16.340> here<00:02:17.020> okay<00:02:18.020> so<00:02:18.080> you<00:02:18.290> can

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:18.410 
let's keep going here okay so you can

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:20.470 
let's keep going here okay so you can
see<00:02:18.560> a<00:02:18.590> guy<00:02:18.800> walks<00:02:19.040> along<00:02:19.340> this<00:02:20.060> little<00:02:20.330> thing

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 
see a guy walks along this little thing

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.180 
see a guy walks along this little thing
launches<00:02:20.780> into<00:02:20.900> the<00:02:21.050> air<00:02:21.140> and<00:02:21.290> he's<00:02:21.950> standing

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:22.190 
launches into the air and he's standing

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:23.949 
launches into the air and he's standing
there<00:02:22.520> now<00:02:22.700> one<00:02:23.209> thing<00:02:23.240> I<00:02:23.450> do<00:02:23.510> notice<00:02:23.720> is<00:02:23.930> that

00:02:23.949 --> 00:02:23.959 
there now one thing I do notice is that

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:27.070 
there now one thing I do notice is that
as<00:02:24.200> this<00:02:24.350> launches<00:02:24.709> up<00:02:24.890> the<00:02:25.270> the<00:02:26.270> box<00:02:26.900> that

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:27.080 
as this launches up the the box that

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:29.110 
as this launches up the the box that
launched<00:02:27.440> it<00:02:27.560> has<00:02:27.800> not<00:02:27.950> disappeared<00:02:28.340> so<00:02:28.880> this

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:29.120 
launched it has not disappeared so this

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:30.490 
launched it has not disappeared so this
I<00:02:29.270> think<00:02:29.330> lends<00:02:29.690> credence<00:02:29.959> the<00:02:30.230> idea<00:02:30.470> that

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:30.500 
I think lends credence the idea that

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:33.430 
I think lends credence the idea that
it's<00:02:30.709> a<00:02:30.770> multiple<00:02:31.070> kill<00:02:31.430> device<00:02:32.270> and<00:02:32.540> also<00:02:33.140> has

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:33.440 
it's a multiple kill device and also has

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:36.100 
it's a multiple kill device and also has
some<00:02:33.830> peripheral<00:02:34.190> implications<00:02:34.880> so<00:02:34.940> this<00:02:35.900> is

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:36.110 
some peripheral implications so this is

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:37.660 
some peripheral implications so this is
basically<00:02:36.410> what<00:02:36.920> it<00:02:36.950> looks<00:02:37.160> like<00:02:37.220> is<00:02:37.400> a<00:02:37.430> thing

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:37.670 
basically what it looks like is a thing

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:39.400 
basically what it looks like is a thing
you<00:02:37.790> set<00:02:38.030> down<00:02:38.060> and<00:02:38.540> it<00:02:38.900> launches<00:02:39.020> things<00:02:39.320> up

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:39.410 
you set down and it launches things up

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:41.050 
you set down and it launches things up
into<00:02:39.560> the<00:02:39.650> air<00:02:39.680> onto<00:02:40.220> uncommon<00:02:40.640> enemies<00:02:40.910> and

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:41.060 
into the air onto uncommon enemies and

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:43.090 
into the air onto uncommon enemies and
kills<00:02:41.239> them<00:02:41.360> right<00:02:41.660> now<00:02:42.260> I'm<00:02:42.560> going<00:02:43.040> to

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:43.100 
kills them right now I'm going to

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:44.350 
kills them right now I'm going to
predict<00:02:43.400> two<00:02:43.640> things<00:02:43.850> to<00:02:43.970> the<00:02:44.090> first<00:02:44.270> thing

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:44.360 
predict two things to the first thing

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:46.510 
predict two things to the first thing
that<00:02:44.420> I<00:02:44.510> predict<00:02:44.810> is<00:02:45.020> that<00:02:45.560> it<00:02:45.800> is<00:02:45.920> limited<00:02:46.220> use

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:46.520 
that I predict is that it is limited use

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:48.520 
that I predict is that it is limited use
i<00:02:46.670> brewed<00:02:46.970> I<00:02:47.120> guess<00:02:47.390> it<00:02:47.570> has<00:02:47.720> maybe<00:02:48.200> between

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:48.530 
i brewed I guess it has maybe between

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:50.440 
i brewed I guess it has maybe between
three<00:02:48.920> and<00:02:48.950> five<00:02:49.220> shots<00:02:49.790> before<00:02:50.090> it<00:02:50.150> explodes

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:50.450 
three and five shots before it explodes

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:51.850 
three and five shots before it explodes
considering<00:02:51.230> it's<00:02:51.320> like<00:02:51.410> a<00:02:51.470> three<00:02:51.709> kill

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:51.860 
considering it's like a three kill

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:56.830 
considering it's like a three kill
streak<00:02:52.070> and<00:02:53.769> that<00:02:54.769> basically<00:02:55.750> there<00:02:56.750> will

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:56.840 
streak and that basically there will

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:57.880 
streak and that basically there will
also<00:02:56.959> be<00:02:57.050> a<00:02:57.140> way<00:02:57.230> to<00:02:57.290> counter<00:02:57.590> it<00:02:57.620> because

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:57.890 
also be a way to counter it because

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:59.320 
also be a way to counter it because
it'll<00:02:58.040> be<00:02:58.100> like<00:02:58.280> sentry<00:02:58.610> guns<00:02:58.790> I<00:02:58.910> bet<00:02:59.150> that<00:02:59.180> the

00:02:59.320 --> 00:02:59.330 
it'll be like sentry guns I bet that the

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:00.280 
it'll be like sentry guns I bet that the
way<00:02:59.390> you<00:02:59.450> can<00:02:59.570> run<00:02:59.660> up<00:02:59.750> to<00:02:59.780> it<00:02:59.930> and<00:02:59.959> I<00:03:00.110> fit

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:00.290 
way you can run up to it and I fit

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:02.140 
way you can run up to it and I fit
without<00:03:00.739> destroying<00:03:01.130> you<00:03:01.280> so<00:03:01.489> let's<00:03:01.970> keep

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:02.150 
without destroying you so let's keep

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:05.080 
without destroying you so let's keep
watching<00:03:02.239> yes<00:03:03.489> okay<00:03:04.489> so<00:03:04.550> that<00:03:04.730> thing<00:03:04.880> blew<00:03:05.060> up

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:05.090 
watching yes okay so that thing blew up

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:07.509 
watching yes okay so that thing blew up
it<00:03:05.900> killed<00:03:06.110> 40<00:03:06.320> to<00:03:06.680> which<00:03:06.920> I<00:03:07.160> think<00:03:07.340> we're<00:03:07.430> all

00:03:07.509 --> 00:03:07.519 
it killed 40 to which I think we're all

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:09.490 
it killed 40 to which I think we're all
happy<00:03:07.670> about<00:03:07.730> and<00:03:08.060> you<00:03:08.870> could<00:03:08.989> see<00:03:09.080> he<00:03:09.230> got<00:03:09.350> a

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:09.500 
happy about and you could see he got a

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:11.020 
happy about and you could see he got a
juggernaut<00:03:09.860> which<00:03:09.980> is<00:03:10.070> a<00:03:10.100> 14<00:03:10.459> point<00:03:10.700> streak

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:11.030 
juggernaut which is a 14 point streak

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.710 
juggernaut which is a 14 point streak
which<00:03:11.120> I'm<00:03:11.180> not<00:03:11.300> sure<00:03:11.390> anyone<00:03:11.570> was

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:11.720 
which I'm not sure anyone was

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:15.340 
which I'm not sure anyone was
particularly<00:03:12.170> surprised<00:03:12.800> well<00:03:13.040> now<00:03:13.910> a<00:03:14.350> few

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:15.350 
particularly surprised well now a few

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:16.600 
particularly surprised well now a few
things<00:03:15.470> here<00:03:15.709> first<00:03:15.739> thing<00:03:15.980> is<00:03:16.160> that<00:03:16.190> his<00:03:16.400> kill

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:16.610 
things here first thing is that his kill

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:18.430 
things here first thing is that his kill
Street<00:03:16.820> got<00:03:16.940> another<00:03:17.150> kill<00:03:17.360> and<00:03:17.600> it<00:03:17.720> got<00:03:18.230> him

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:18.440 
Street got another kill and it got him

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:20.340 
Street got another kill and it got him
his<00:03:18.650> next<00:03:18.890> point<00:03:19.040> streak<00:03:19.280> well<00:03:19.579> you<00:03:19.940> know<00:03:20.030> his

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:20.350 
his next point streak well you know his

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:22.390 
his next point streak well you know his
point<00:03:21.350> streak<00:03:21.410> got<00:03:21.650> another<00:03:21.860> killing<00:03:22.040> another

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:22.400 
point streak got another killing another

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:25.810 
point streak got another killing another
point<00:03:22.610> streak<00:03:22.760> so<00:03:23.299> it<00:03:23.720> seems<00:03:23.900> likely<00:03:24.380> that<00:03:24.820> the

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:25.820 
point streak so it seems likely that the

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:28.720 
point streak so it seems likely that the
streak<00:03:26.209> stack<00:03:26.600> in<00:03:26.900> their<00:03:27.260> pointless<00:03:28.010> I<00:03:28.519> don't

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:28.730 
streak stack in their pointless I don't

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:30.039 
streak stack in their pointless I don't
know<00:03:28.790> how<00:03:28.880> you<00:03:28.940> say<00:03:29.120> it<00:03:29.150> point<00:03:29.450> streak<00:03:29.750> stack

00:03:30.039 --> 00:03:30.049 
know how you say it point streak stack

00:03:30.049 --> 00:03:32.110 
know how you say it point streak stack
that<00:03:30.260> I<00:03:30.350> won't<00:03:30.500> say<00:03:30.709> it<00:03:30.920> but<00:03:31.549> what's<00:03:31.940> more

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:32.120 
that I won't say it but what's more

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:33.819 
that I won't say it but what's more
exciting<00:03:32.630> perhaps<00:03:33.079> is<00:03:33.230> in<00:03:33.320> the<00:03:33.380> bottom<00:03:33.680> right

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:33.829 
exciting perhaps is in the bottom right

00:03:33.829 --> 00:03:35.140 
exciting perhaps is in the bottom right
corner<00:03:33.860> we<00:03:34.310> can<00:03:34.430> see<00:03:34.549> that<00:03:34.700> the<00:03:34.790> juggernaut

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:35.150 
corner we can see that the juggernaut

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:38.350 
corner we can see that the juggernaut
icon<00:03:35.420> now<00:03:35.630> has<00:03:35.840> three<00:03:36.170> arrows<00:03:36.760> down<00:03:37.760> up<00:03:38.120> and

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:38.360 
icon now has three arrows down up and

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:40.449 
icon now has three arrows down up and
right<00:03:38.810> now<00:03:38.989> i'm<00:03:39.049> not<00:03:39.260> sure<00:03:39.500> but<00:03:39.739> down<00:03:40.070> up<00:03:40.340> i'm

00:03:40.449 --> 00:03:40.459 
right now i'm not sure but down up i'm

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:41.830 
right now i'm not sure but down up i'm
pretty<00:03:40.670> sure<00:03:40.850> just<00:03:41.120> cycling<00:03:41.450> through<00:03:41.690> kill

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:41.840 
pretty sure just cycling through kill

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:43.180 
pretty sure just cycling through kill
streaks<00:03:42.079> that<00:03:42.170> seems<00:03:42.440> pretty<00:03:42.590> likely<00:03:42.829> to<00:03:43.100> me

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:43.190 
streaks that seems pretty likely to me

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:45.130 
streaks that seems pretty likely to me
but<00:03:43.790> right<00:03:44.120> i'm<00:03:44.329> confused<00:03:44.780> about<00:03:44.870> one<00:03:45.110> thing

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:45.140 
but right i'm confused about one thing

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:46.479 
but right i'm confused about one thing
I'm<00:03:45.320> also<00:03:45.440> noticing<00:03:45.620> is<00:03:45.890> that<00:03:45.920> the<00:03:46.100> bar<00:03:46.280> on<00:03:46.400> the

00:03:46.479 --> 00:03:46.489 
I'm also noticing is that the bar on the

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:48.759 
I'm also noticing is that the bar on the
right<00:03:46.519> has<00:03:46.790> filled<00:03:47.120> up<00:03:47.329> again<00:03:47.510> just<00:03:48.500> a<00:03:48.560> little

00:03:48.759 --> 00:03:48.769 
right has filled up again just a little

00:03:48.769 --> 00:03:51.330 
right has filled up again just a little
bit<00:03:48.860> i'm<00:03:48.980> not<00:03:49.160> sure<00:03:49.340> what<00:03:49.549> that<00:03:49.610> means<00:03:49.970> exactly

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:51.340 
bit i'm not sure what that means exactly

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:53.440 
bit i'm not sure what that means exactly
my<00:03:52.340> guess<00:03:52.549> would<00:03:52.579> be<00:03:52.730> that<00:03:52.820> you<00:03:52.910> can<00:03:52.970> like<00:03:53.180> lock

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:53.450 
my guess would be that you can like lock

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:55.449 
my guess would be that you can like lock
it<00:03:53.600> in<00:03:53.720> somehow<00:03:54.019> i'm<00:03:54.350> not<00:03:54.410> quite<00:03:54.799> sure<00:03:54.829> how<00:03:55.430> to

00:03:55.449 --> 00:03:55.459 
it in somehow i'm not quite sure how to

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:57.039 
it in somehow i'm not quite sure how to
explain<00:03:55.640> that<00:03:55.880> but<00:03:56.150> i<00:03:56.209> think<00:03:56.269> maybe<00:03:56.750> you<00:03:56.900> can

00:03:57.039 --> 00:03:57.049 
explain that but i think maybe you can

00:03:57.049 --> 00:03:59.289 
explain that but i think maybe you can
choose<00:03:57.590> not<00:03:57.620> to<00:03:58.040> take<00:03:58.220> a<00:03:58.250> point<00:03:58.430> streak<00:03:58.730> so

00:03:59.289 --> 00:03:59.299 
choose not to take a point streak so

00:03:59.299 --> 00:04:00.699 
choose not to take a point streak so
maybe<00:03:59.420> you<00:03:59.540> have<00:03:59.630> to<00:03:59.750> spend<00:04:00.079> your<00:04:00.200> points<00:04:00.440> as

00:04:00.699 --> 00:04:00.709 
maybe you have to spend your points as

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:03.640 
maybe you have to spend your points as
opposed<00:04:01.130> to<00:04:01.430> as<00:04:01.910> opposed<00:04:02.720> to<00:04:02.810> you<00:04:02.900> know<00:04:02.930> so

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:03.650 
opposed to as opposed to you know so

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:05.050 
opposed to as opposed to you know so
instead<00:04:03.829> of<00:04:03.920> going<00:04:04.040> three<00:04:04.489> kills<00:04:04.700> you<00:04:04.820> 85

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:05.060

all your points that's my suspicion just

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:13.090 
all your points that's my suspicion just
because<00:04:11.900> of<00:04:12.140> that<00:04:12.170> right<00:04:12.440> arrow<00:04:12.650> that<00:04:12.859> seems

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:13.100 
because of that right arrow that seems

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:14.440 
because of that right arrow that seems
likely<00:04:13.400> to<00:04:13.489> me<00:04:13.579> maybe<00:04:13.760> I'm<00:04:13.910> wrong<00:04:14.030> I<00:04:14.209> could

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:14.450 
likely to me maybe I'm wrong I could

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:17.110 
likely to me maybe I'm wrong I could
well<00:04:14.630> be<00:04:14.750> but<00:04:15.200> that<00:04:15.500> just<00:04:15.530> seems<00:04:15.739> a<00:04:16.519> central

00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:17.120 
well be but that just seems a central

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:18.190 
well be but that just seems a central
implication<00:04:17.539> to<00:04:17.630> me<00:04:17.720> and<00:04:17.810> that's<00:04:17.930> pretty<00:04:18.049> much

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:18.200 
implication to me and that's pretty much

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:19.960 
implication to me and that's pretty much
the<00:04:18.289> entirety<00:04:18.650> of<00:04:18.680> the<00:04:18.769> trailer<00:04:19.010> then<00:04:19.609> goes<00:04:19.820> on

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:19.970 
the entirety of the trailer then goes on

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:21.460 
the entirety of the trailer then goes on
there's<00:04:20.209> lots<00:04:20.329> of<00:04:20.390> fans<00:04:20.600> explosions<00:04:21.079> and<00:04:21.260> it

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:21.470 
there's lots of fans explosions and it

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:22.750 
there's lots of fans explosions and it
