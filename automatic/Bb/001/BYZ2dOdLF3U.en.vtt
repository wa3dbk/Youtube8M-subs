00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.439 
little tornado I think that's a tornado
on<00:00:51.149> a<00:00:51.300> tack<00:00:51.649> that's<00:00:52.649> something<00:00:53.010> new<00:00:53.449> and

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
on a tack that's something new and

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.660 
on a tack that's something new and
another<00:00:55.110> thing<00:00:55.350> i<00:00:55.530> noticed<00:00:55.920> i<00:00:56.160> don't<00:00:56.489> think

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
another thing i noticed i don't think

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.150 
another thing i noticed i don't think
they<00:00:56.760> come<00:00:56.940> with<00:00:57.059> these<00:00:57.620> these<00:00:58.620> home<00:00:58.859> buyers

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
they come with these these home buyers

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.799 
they come with these these home buyers
coming<00:00:59.520> a<00:00:59.670> flight<00:00:59.910> tracker<00:01:00.180> than<00:01:00.510> or<00:01:00.570> whatever

coming a flight tracker than or whatever
this<00:01:00.899> is<00:01:01.079> I<00:01:02.570> guess<00:01:03.570> it's<00:01:04.199> a<00:01:04.290> little<00:01:04.320> card<00:01:04.710> to

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
lightning strikes inside I thought that

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:19.040
