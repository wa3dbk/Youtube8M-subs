00:05:14.769 --> 00:05:14.779 
both formats on the bottom you have the

00:05:14.779 --> 00:05:17.390 
both formats on the bottom you have the
on<00:05:15.779> the<00:05:16.110> bottom<00:05:16.379> you<00:05:16.409> have<00:05:16.500> the<00:05:16.680> slot<00:05:17.009> for<00:05:17.370> a

tripod and then you also have the
mechanism<00:05:21.029> to<00:05:22.069> bring<00:05:23.069> out<00:05:23.189> the<00:05:23.339> the<00:05:23.729> USB<00:05:24.150> arm

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:24.360 
mechanism to bring out the the USB arm

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:25.790 
mechanism to bring out the the USB arm
so<00:05:24.629> you<00:05:24.659> have<00:05:24.870> to<00:05:24.990> do<00:05:25.080> to<00:05:25.199> have<00:05:25.259> to<00:05:25.349> push<00:05:25.560> down

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:25.800 
so you have to do to have to push down

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:30.230 
so you have to do to have to push down
on<00:05:25.830> this<00:05:26.069> thing<00:05:26.370> and<00:05:26.610> then<00:05:27.560> push<00:05:28.560> out<00:05:28.830> and<00:05:29.240> USB

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:30.240 
on this thing and then push out and USB

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:33.619 
on this thing and then push out and USB
arm<00:05:30.509> comes<00:05:30.749> out<00:05:31.909> so<00:05:32.909> it's<00:05:33.060> not<00:05:33.180> as<00:05:33.330> intuitive

00:05:33.619 --> 00:05:33.629 
arm comes out so it's not as intuitive

00:05:33.629 --> 00:05:37.879 
arm comes out so it's not as intuitive
or<00:05:34.139> as<00:05:34.740> a<00:05:34.770> as<00:05:35.279> fun<00:05:36.270> as<00:05:36.449> the<00:05:36.629> flips<00:05:37.020> but<00:05:37.409> it<00:05:37.740> gets

00:05:37.879 --> 00:05:37.889 
or as a as fun as the flips but it gets

00:05:37.889 --> 00:05:43.700 
or as a as fun as the flips but it gets
the<00:05:38.009> job<00:05:38.069> done<00:05:41.930> also<00:05:42.930> in<00:05:43.050> the<00:05:43.139> same<00:05:43.319> thing<00:05:43.589> is

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:43.710 
the job done also in the same thing is

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:46.550 
the job done also in the same thing is
where<00:05:44.069> the<00:05:44.189> u.s.<00:05:44.370> thing<00:05:44.909> where<00:05:45.899> the<00:05:45.990> USP<00:05:46.289> arm

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:46.560 
where the u.s. thing where the USP arm

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:49.040 
where the u.s. thing where the USP arm
comes<00:05:46.830> out<00:05:46.949> is<00:05:47.099> the<00:05:47.789> the<00:05:48.389> place<00:05:48.569> where<00:05:48.750> you<00:05:48.810> put

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:49.050 
comes out is the the place where you put

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:56.410
