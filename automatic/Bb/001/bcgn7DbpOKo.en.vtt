00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:07.500
 hello everyone today we will talk about 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:10.160
 shooting ks16 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:14.210
 this small lesson will be for those who 

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:18.240
 just starting to take the first steps to 

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:20.850
 rails and swearing at those who his 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:26.039
 you kill instantly always 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:32.759
 and the critic has become all Cyrus that is to begin 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:36.090
 We with dogs as shoot and locks 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:41.610
 that is, I later show you how from Kalash 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:44.760
 and females base means shooting at 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:47.100
 long distance average and close 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.010
 distance ie start the building on 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:54.360
 long range must shoot 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:56.550
 try to shoot two three four 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:00.260
 one cartridge is also possible but 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:04.010
 one shoot those who have a good skill and 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:05.900
 he played it very long and hard 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:08.280
 trained and so on 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:12.510
 so at long range you 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:18.420
 shoot 3-4 patron it yourself 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:22.020
 best if you aim your head well 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:24.540
 u try to aim at the head that 3 4 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.060
 the cartridge is quite enough to put 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.920
 good want 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:31.759
 we have a middle distance here a little bit 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:36.390
 we will be different we will shoot 

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:40.200
 clamp clamp we will top 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:41.369
 risochka top risk and the very sight I 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.700
 it'll show you how 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:48.010
 that is, you pinch 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:51.070
 person with and trying that would be true risk 

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:54.280
 sight hit their head that is to 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:57.970
 drivers and clamp all fully 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:02:00.820
 clip and then you will have a good chance 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:04.440
 just reduce the enemy as it should be 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:04.440
 I'll show you how to do it. 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:18.819
 here we are just trying to try 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:22.900
 keep this scatter itself pulling up 

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:27.760
 sight down a little but a little down well 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:32.650
 so try to hold it on 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:36.810
 the middle then we do it at all 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:36.810
 excellent scatter when bullets 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:44.019
 when a bullet in one radius is not strong 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:47.799
 fly away and so you will be very 

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:51.790
 easy to kill the enemy here I am again 

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:55.360
 show and when you shoot just 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:59.890
 clamping doing nothing with your mouse 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:02.680
 it turns out that's what you get 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:07.390
 Here is such a seven and so hard 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:09.629
 get there because you shoot big 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:09.629
 scatter 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:17.230
 Kalasha the same to generally harder 

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:18.609
 shoot but if you learn them 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:22.239
 good shoot something 

00:03:18.609 --> 00:03:24.370
 prices are just rare so let's start the average 

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:27.220
 distance is the very same ie top 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:31.060
 risk we clamp and try to utyat 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:31.840
 sight weight down while keeping it in 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:34.630
 middle 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:37.780
 that is, by keeping this scatter yourself 

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:39.870
 big and we get here such 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:43.630
 small scatter 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:48.549
 which will give you the opportunity quickly and 

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:50.650
 quality here is to kill the enemy 

00:03:48.549 --> 00:03:54.640
 shown 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:57.870
 it just eat pull down sight and 

00:03:54.640 --> 00:04:00.700
 try this top risk and sight 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:03.909
 point over can point then there is something on 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:06.659
 head man but it is only on average 

00:04:03.909 --> 00:04:10.390
 distance because Kalash further 

00:04:06.659 --> 00:04:14.129
 bullets fly very much in the range on 

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:18.690
 long distance too 3 4 rounds 

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:24.880
 quite enough to carry 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:27.370
 enemy head close close shoot 

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:30.510
 but close here I think of telling you 

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:33.760
 don't need to be complete 

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:36.310
 noob so as not to kill the close distance 

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:37.750
 here you pinch as you want as you can 

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:41.949
 you have it flying 

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:44.430
 These cartridges are flying here all at one point 

00:04:41.949 --> 00:04:44.430
 video 

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:54.260
 and when you try simply 

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:56.450
 hold your sight goes up and in 

00:04:54.260 --> 00:05:00.140
 the result is our one this one 

00:04:56.450 --> 00:05:07.880
 seven which does not give you much 

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:10.280
 chances to get in and when you type targets on 

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:13.940
 top risk of sight you get 

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:18.400
 here is a small cluster of bullets which 

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:18.400
 will help you kill the enemy faster 

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:31.660
 long distance I like it said 

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:36.100
 2-3 rounds per cartridge around 

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:39.670
 marching up to 1 cartridge flies exactly 

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:42.880
 center of sight that is how you hover 

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:45.700
 sight there and the bullet will fly to the middle 

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:49.050
 but for this you need a good skill 

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:54.430
 need to train not only with but 

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:57.910
 different programs that's it 

00:05:54.430 --> 00:06:01.300
 small entry can someone 

00:05:57.910 --> 00:06:03.790
 it will help someone but not yet 

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:04.540
 I repeat it for those who only 

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:10.690
 starts 

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:15.840
 because that small the time is still hard 

00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:19.960
 general order how and where but what 

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:22.600
 right thing to do for those who played 

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:26.560
 many years it is clear this is all fine 

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:30.400
 know and understand everything thank you all for 

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:32.790
 attention and waiting for comments under the video 

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:32.790
 until
