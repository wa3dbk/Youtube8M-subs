Hi your with Scott from EZTravelPad today at Couples Resort in San Souci in Ocho Rios, Jamaica. We will have a look around here and you will love it

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:20.700
We are in a little gazebo overlooking the Caribbean Sea

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:27.580
Vegetation is totally lush throughout this 30 acre resort

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:34.400
Only slightly over 200 rooms. So you get a sense that there is ample space everywhere

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:53.140
For a romantic vacation, celebrate your honeymoon, your anniversary, or maybe just a spa vacation

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:03.000
from your balcony room, oceanfront, short walk down some steps

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:13.460
passed a fern covered wall 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:20.680
into more lush tropical vegetation

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.180
down into the spa area

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:48.220
just off the beach is one of the best looking reefs that I've seen, this is probably the most romantic resort that I've found anywhere in Jamaica that caters to adult couples

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:09.660
walking along the gardens are everywhere over 30 acres

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:18.000
of gorgeous Jamaican tropical paradise

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:32.600
have you thought about a Destination Wedding, something just you, your spouse, a couple friends in a intimate setting, somewhere in the Caribbean

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:45.220
it doesn't get much better than this

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:16.120
Couples San Souci

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:20.040
exudes romance 

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:36.760
catching a snooze on a shady hammock overlooking the Caribbean, something that interest you

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:42.600
again doesn't get much better than this

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:43.980
look at that sea

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:56.800
now look at that beach
