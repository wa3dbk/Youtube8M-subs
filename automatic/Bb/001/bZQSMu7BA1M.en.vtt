00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:18.650 
it usually makes things more difficult

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:21.069 
it usually makes things more difficult
for<00:03:19.160> someone<00:03:19.609> else<00:03:19.790> and<00:03:20.030> in<00:03:20.329> this<00:03:20.510> case<00:03:20.780> it's

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:21.079 
for someone else and in this case it's

00:03:21.079 --> 00:03:22.720 
for someone else and in this case it's
making<00:03:21.440> it<00:03:21.560> harder<00:03:21.889> for<00:03:21.920> me<00:03:22.069> to<00:03:22.160> get<00:03:22.340> my<00:03:22.489> work

done because I had to stop and answer
all<00:03:24.590> your<00:03:24.709> questions<00:03:25.010> oh<00:03:25.930> so<00:03:26.930> that's<00:03:27.169> why

all your questions oh so that's why

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:30.030 
all your questions oh so that's why
having<00:03:27.950> patients<00:03:28.430> is<00:03:28.519> so<00:03:28.730> important<00:03:29.389> I<00:03:29.540> guess

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:30.040 
having patients is so important I guess

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:34.539 
having patients is so important I guess
without<00:03:31.040> patients<00:03:31.730> were<00:03:31.880> kind<00:03:32.150> of<00:03:33.549> selfish

00:03:34.539 --> 00:03:34.549 
without patients were kind of selfish

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:36.039 
without patients were kind of selfish
that's<00:03:35.450> right

00:03:36.039 --> 00:03:36.049 
that's right

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:42.250 
that's right
not<00:03:36.650> being<00:03:36.889> patient<00:03:37.190> is<00:03:37.459> selfish<00:03:39.310> hmm<00:03:40.630> and<00:03:41.630> and

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:42.260 
not being patient is selfish hmm and and

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:45.309 
not being patient is selfish hmm and and
we<00:03:43.160> hurt<00:03:43.400> other<00:03:43.700> people<00:03:44.269> when<00:03:44.510> we're<00:03:44.720> selfish

00:03:45.309 --> 00:03:45.319 
we hurt other people when we're selfish

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:50.140 
we hurt other people when we're selfish
and<00:03:46.310> we<00:03:46.459> hurt<00:03:46.669> ourselves<00:03:46.819> to<00:03:47.419> Josiah<00:03:48.940> God<00:03:49.940> is
