00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:10.379
 universal reel on crossbow 

00:00:10.379 --> 00:00:12.469
 but first we consider the case 

00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:14.759
 when the coil is put 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:17.130
 like what is put in two cases 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:18.550
 it's me 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:20.829
 when hunting for big fish 

00:00:20.829 --> 00:00:23.829
 to fishermen dragged the gun 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:26.890
 too lazy to look with a coil 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:28.630
 and the second is 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:30.539
 when hunting in the rubble 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:32.120
 or grottoes 

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:35.040
 in order not to lose a gun 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.240
 released coil and gun exhale area 

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:41.660
 displayed on the surface 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:45.030
 move on to installing the coil 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.490
 for this we need guns besides 

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:50.490
 omon lines 

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:54.540
 pair of clamps 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:57.000
 crimping Tools 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.640
 and round nation 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.810
 in order to install the coil 

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:04.810
 first we need to remove the handle 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:08.330
 yesterday supreme 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:15.610
 twisting fixing screw 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:24.730
 here are the city streets 

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:27.730
 and knock out this one fixing honors 

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:37.230
 if to the world 

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:39.910
 and take out 

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:42.910
 bailout 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:46.390
 after 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:47.810
 weakens 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:50.810
 tension bolt 

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:00.980
 exchange reel us the word ballet 

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:05.290
 assembly is coming 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:08.529
 in reverse order 

00:02:08.529 --> 00:02:11.529
 insert the handle 

00:02:14.279 --> 00:02:17.279
 scoring locking steve 

00:02:18.699 --> 00:02:20.229
 and potatoes 

00:02:20.229 --> 00:02:23.229
 fastening on the move on the locking 

00:02:25.299 --> 00:02:28.299
 closing down 

00:02:33.469 --> 00:02:34.679
 now you can 

00:02:34.679 --> 00:02:37.679
 tighten the lock 

00:02:39.079 --> 00:02:41.609
 so the coil we installed now i 

00:02:41.609 --> 00:02:43.619
 show you how to properly equip 

00:02:43.619 --> 00:02:44.569
 crossbow 

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:46.079
 perhaps we will start with the most important thing 

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:48.309
 of the law 

00:02:48.309 --> 00:02:50.869
 a hole in the ridge intended to 

00:02:50.869 --> 00:02:52.759
 fastening line 

00:02:52.759 --> 00:02:54.089
 It has 

00:02:54.089 --> 00:02:55.669
 spicy fast food 

00:02:55.669 --> 00:02:58.879
 this acute phase needs to be removed on a hodgepodge 

00:02:59.689 --> 00:03:00.589
 for this 

00:03:00.589 --> 00:03:03.019
 take a circle for bread and start circular 

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:06.219
 movements 

00:03:06.219 --> 00:03:09.219
 Polish 

00:03:18.779 --> 00:03:20.919
 after we take the monolith 

00:03:20.919 --> 00:03:23.919
 and do the harpoon binding 

00:03:37.409 --> 00:03:40.409
 the loop can be made a little longer 

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:45.069
 take special keys and his wife and son 

00:03:59.869 --> 00:04:02.869
 It turns out such a neat clip 

00:04:05.049 --> 00:04:06.979
 further leave the harpoon handed and 

00:04:06.979 --> 00:04:08.859
 measuring the desired length 

00:04:08.859 --> 00:04:11.859
 Kostya 

00:04:14.089 --> 00:04:17.089
 during the reign of Vladimir cooks 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:25.659
 and here in this place they made a loop for 

00:04:25.659 --> 00:04:28.999
 connections on average under coils 

00:04:28.999 --> 00:04:31.999
 movement coming out of the coil 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:35.340
 must pass special 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:36.680
 livestock hole 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:38.650
 and only then fixed with 

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:39.870
 hetman lines 

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:42.870
 we miss the head leader 

00:04:44.629 --> 00:04:47.629

00:04:59.819 --> 00:05:02.819
 Centre 

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:06.300
 ahead coming from which 4 

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:08.419
 going through trade 

00:05:08.419 --> 00:05:10.749
 connects with major customers 

00:05:10.749 --> 00:05:13.749
 either a deaf body or a knot which 

00:05:13.749 --> 00:05:15.759
 can untie the water 

00:05:15.759 --> 00:05:18.319
 such compounds i use so 

00:05:18.319 --> 00:05:21.319

 disconnect main line 

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:40.220
 but mona line this is done by one 

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:43.219
 by movement 

00:05:43.219 --> 00:05:46.039
 released 

00:05:46.039 --> 00:05:49.039
 further laid laziness 

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:53.870
 we tighten the coil 

00:05:56.599 --> 00:05:59.289
