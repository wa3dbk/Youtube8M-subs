00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:04.890
 good minutes to a good new video 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.230
 somewhat unusual news we could 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:09.480
 we could say and it's good 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.040
 be that a guy a Christian player 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.260
 to understand is why I say what 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.880
 Christian, it seems that it has 

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:16.410
 offended sense with the principle of 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.390
 bayern show final kim is good is a 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.130
 small spoiler what a good thing if you already 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.690
 had played the title because it does not suppose 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.060
 nothing depressed had played the title 

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:27.000
 the news bothers you a bit like that 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.439
 that's good if I'm one of those who do not want 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.570
 know the story of a game because it 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:33.640
 I would remove the video because I do not know 

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:35.140
 will not like maybe not though good 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:37.420
 from the beginning the spoiler so good 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:39.760
 let's continue with the news and it is that 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:41.350
 good it seems that in the beginning already 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:42.970
 you know when you try to enter 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:46.450
 columbia and such you have to how 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:49.750
 say it rebaptize to enter the 

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:51.699
 city ​​and such a quite emotional scene 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:53.590
 we would say pretty good from the beginning 

00:00:51.699 --> 00:00:55.809
 of the game is all pretty good and good 

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:57.010
 it seems that this user creates this 

00:00:55.809 --> 00:01:01.210
 user start in Christianity 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:02.769
 Well, this bothered him a lot and he made 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:04.780
 valve returned the money because 

00:01:02.769 --> 00:01:07.570
 valve because he bought it in steam and this one 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:09.190
 ok and good it seems that even you 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:10.930
 they returned the money, that is, 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:12.850
 They went full as clarifies this guy 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:15.729
 ok he said nothing about it 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:17.110
 they have returned him or not but hey it seems 

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:19.960
 be that the guy says yes they have 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:22.210
 returned I the truth is somewhat 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:24.090
 hypocrite all this is worth that I can 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:26.729
 offend him 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.770
 for your Christian religion so that you 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.479
 may offend that you have to baptize 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.130
 in a video game that good that is a 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.929
 little incomprehensible 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.210
 in a certain part of what god of 

00:01:33.929 --> 00:01:37.520
 castle for that bullshit that for 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.189
 start 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:42.200
 but fuck if you say you've played the 

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:44.359
 previous several oxytal and you knew a 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:46.310
 little the subject of this valuable then 

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:48.920
 fuck I think killing is forbidden 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:51.319
 worse seen than that I baptize you in a 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:53.179
 video game I say I do not know I do not know if he knows 

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:54.829
 of the kid this later in the game 

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:57.110
 more they have to kill a lot of people 

00:01:54.829 --> 00:02:00.679
 and so, well, I'll leave it there 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:03.140
 I do not know if I know if he thought it or something but 

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:04.369
 well it's kind of weird and stupid all 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:06.649
 the body good news pretty 

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:08.690
 quite unusual and good I do not know 

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:11.209
 really if it is confirmed that valve has 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:11.660
 returned the money fuck i do not know what 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:13.400

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:15.170
 the truth so good nothing more 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:16.489

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:18.940
