and what it meant was that of your fat

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:02.969 
and what it meant was that of your fat
one-third<00:01:00.069> should<00:01:00.339> be<00:01:00.549> from<00:01:01.949> omega-3<00:01:02.949> rich

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:02.979 
one-third should be from omega-3 rich

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:05.820 
one-third should be from omega-3 rich
polyunsaturated<00:01:03.699> fish<00:01:04.659> flex<00:01:05.019> the<00:01:05.650> other

polyunsaturated fish flex the other

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:07.200 
polyunsaturated fish flex the other
third<00:01:06.130> should<00:01:06.340> come<00:01:06.549> from<00:01:06.760> mono<00:01:06.970> and

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:07.210 
third should come from mono and

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:10.500 
third should come from mono and
saturates<00:01:07.890> olive<00:01:08.890> oil<00:01:09.040> avocados<00:01:10.000> that<00:01:10.300> type

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:10.510 
saturates olive oil avocados that type

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:12.600 
saturates olive oil avocados that type
of<00:01:10.540> thing<00:01:10.840> and<00:01:11.020> the<00:01:11.680> last<00:01:11.890> third<00:01:12.160> would<00:01:12.400> come

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:12.610 
of thing and the last third would come

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:16.140 
of thing and the last third would come
from<00:01:12.790> saturated<00:01:13.120> fats<00:01:14.790> so<00:01:15.790> that<00:01:15.940> would<00:01:16.030> be<00:01:16.060> the

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:16.150 
from saturated fats so that would be the

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:19.080 
from saturated fats so that would be the
one<00:01:16.390> that's<00:01:16.540> the<00:01:16.930> one-third<00:01:17.350> rule<00:01:17.880> the<00:01:18.880> amount

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:19.090 
one that's the one-third rule the amount

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:20.580 
one that's the one-third rule the amount
of<00:01:19.180> fat<00:01:19.330> you<00:01:19.420> want<00:01:19.600> to<00:01:19.690> get<00:01:19.810> in<00:01:19.900> your<00:01:20.020> diet<00:01:20.230> is

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:22.090 
going to be about thirty percent that's

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:24.360 
going to be about thirty percent that's
about<00:01:22.360> that's<00:01:22.660> the<00:01:22.840> one<00:01:22.990> area<00:01:23.230> that<00:01:23.440> I<00:01:23.710> think

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:35.590 
I mean for example optimizing hormone

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:38.660 
I mean for example optimizing hormone
levels<00:01:35.920> especially<00:01:36.160> testosterone<00:01:37.620> studies

didn't find above thirty percent to have
additional<00:01:43.150> benefit<00:01:43.540> 32<00:01:43.960> seemed<00:01:44.140> to<00:01:44.230> be<00:01:44.320> just

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:44.350 
additional benefit 32 seemed to be just

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:46.110 
additional benefit 32 seemed to be just
about<00:01:44.620> just<00:01:44.980> about<00:01:45.070> perfect<00:01:45.370> basically<00:01:45.940> about

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:46.120 
about just about perfect basically about

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:48.720 
about just about perfect basically about
as<00:01:46.380> high<00:01:47.380> testosterone<00:01:47.920> levels<00:01:48.430> as<00:01:48.520> you<00:01:48.610> were

as high testosterone levels as you were

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:51.630 
as high testosterone levels as you were
going<00:01:48.909> to<00:01:48.970> get<00:01:49.860> naturally<00:01:50.860> speaking<00:01:51.340> of

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:51.640 
going to get naturally speaking of

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:54.390 
going to get naturally speaking of
course<00:01:52.110> so<00:01:53.110> you<00:01:53.170> it's<00:01:53.710> not<00:01:53.890> that<00:01:53.950> hard<00:01:54.280> to

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:54.400 
course so you it's not that hard to

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:55.649 
course so you it's not that hard to
figure<00:01:54.520> out<00:01:54.730> your<00:01:54.850> fat<00:01:55.030> intake<00:01:55.060> a<00:01:55.420> lot<00:01:55.570> of

people<00:01:55.810> are<00:01:55.990> confused<00:01:56.380> by<00:01:56.560> it<00:01:56.710> and<00:01:56.980> it's

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:57.100 
people are confused by it and it's

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:59.070 
people are confused by it and it's
really<00:01:57.490> not<00:01:57.700> that<00:01:57.760> confusing<00:01:58.390> it<00:01:58.690> should<00:01:58.960> be

00:01:59.070 --> 00:01:59.080 
really not that confusing it should be

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:01.320 
really not that confusing it should be
about<00:01:59.170> thirty<00:01:59.530> percent<00:01:59.800> of<00:01:59.920> calories<00:02:00.340> and<00:02:00.520> as

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:01.330 
about thirty percent of calories and as

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:03.210 
about thirty percent of calories and as
I<00:02:01.450> said<00:02:01.510> of<00:02:01.930> that<00:02:02.110> thirty<00:02:02.380> percent<00:02:02.770> a<00:02:03.010> third

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:03.220 
I said of that thirty percent a third

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:06.410 
I said of that thirty percent a third
would<00:02:03.400> be<00:02:04.080> omega-3<00:02:05.080> rich<00:02:05.110> polyunsaturated

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420

why<00:02:12.050> saturate<00:02:12.650> you<00:02:12.770> might<00:02:12.920> ask<00:02:13.130> you<00:02:13.310> know<00:02:13.460> some

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:13.940 
why saturate you might ask you know some

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:16.540 
why saturate you might ask you know some
people<00:02:14.210> think<00:02:14.360> that's<00:02:14.569> a<00:02:14.870> bad<00:02:15.800> fat<00:02:16.190> it's<00:02:16.400> not

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:16.550 
people think that's a bad fat it's not

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:20.410 
people think that's a bad fat it's not
actually<00:02:17.180> like<00:02:17.900> anything<00:02:18.319> too<00:02:18.500> much<00:02:18.680> of<00:02:18.890> it<00:02:19.420> in

actually like anything too much of it in

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:23.410 
actually like anything too much of it in

they<00:02:44.870> are<00:02:45.050> positive<00:02:45.800> so<00:02:46.400> the<00:02:47.120> interesting

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:47.330 
they are positive so the interesting

they are positive so the interesting

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:49.580 
thing about to get back to saturated fat

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:51.670 
thing about to get back to saturated fat
is<00:02:50.209> some<00:02:50.690> of<00:02:50.810> the<00:02:50.870> studies<00:02:51.050> suggest<00:02:51.560> that

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:51.680 
is some of the studies suggest that

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:53.860 
is some of the studies suggest that
interestingly<00:02:51.980> that<00:02:52.370> to<00:02:52.820> get<00:02:53.300> these<00:02:53.510> effects

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:53.870 
interestingly that to get these effects

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:56.590 
interestingly that to get these effects
on<00:02:54.050> hormones<00:02:54.500> any<00:02:55.430> fat<00:02:55.820> didn't<00:02:56.150> do<00:02:56.269> it<00:02:56.450> you

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:56.600 
on hormones any fat didn't do it you

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:59.170 
on hormones any fat didn't do it you
actually<00:02:56.980> needed<00:02:57.980> some<00:02:58.160> saturated<00:02:58.820> fat<00:02:58.970> for

00:02:59.170 --> 00:02:59.180 
actually needed some saturated fat for

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:01.420 
actually needed some saturated fat for
this<00:02:59.300> and<00:03:00.140> of<00:03:00.320> course<00:03:00.350> you<00:03:00.890> know<00:03:01.010> like<00:03:01.220> all

00:03:30.009 --> 00:03:30.019 
weight loss what I will actually

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:32.620 
weight loss what I will actually
recommend<00:03:30.650> however<00:03:30.739> is<00:03:31.130> changing<00:03:32.060> the<00:03:32.090> ratios

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:32.630 
recommend however is changing the ratios

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:34.990 
recommend however is changing the ratios
of<00:03:32.660> these<00:03:33.049> fats<00:03:33.350> for<00:03:34.250> example<00:03:34.610> during<00:03:34.730> weight

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:35.000 
of these fats for example during weight

of these fats for example during weight
loss<00:03:35.030> phases<00:03:35.750> I<00:03:35.900> will<00:03:36.320> tell<00:03:36.470> people<00:03:36.829> to

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:36.860 
loss phases I will tell people to

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:39.280 
loss phases I will tell people to
emphasize<00:03:37.730> higher<00:03:38.030> amounts<00:03:38.480> of<00:03:38.570> the<00:03:38.690> omega-3s

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:39.290 
emphasize higher amounts of the omega-3s

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:41.289 
emphasize higher amounts of the omega-3s
and<00:03:39.530> change<00:03:39.980> those<00:03:40.160> ratios<00:03:40.430> but<00:03:41.120> that's

00:03:41.289 --> 00:03:41.299 
and change those ratios but that's

00:03:41.299 --> 00:03:43.539 
and change those ratios but that's
another<00:03:41.540> topic<00:03:41.890> and<00:03:42.890> much<00:03:43.070> more<00:03:43.220> complicated
