00:00:01.429 --> 00:00:10.419 

okay<00:00:02.429> now<00:00:02.610> set<00:00:02.939> the<00:00:03.540> inside<00:00:04.080> of<00:00:04.230> it<00:00:04.319> on<00:00:04.440> fire

00:00:10.419 --> 00:00:10.429 

00:00:10.429 --> 00:00:14.570 

what<00:00:11.429> we<00:00:11.580> doing<00:00:12.380> good<00:00:13.410> hope<00:00:14.040> nothing's<00:00:14.429> been

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
what we doing good hope nothing's been

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.510 
what we doing good hope nothing's been
let<00:00:14.820> out<00:00:14.849> into<00:00:15.210> our<00:00:15.540> world<00:00:15.839> I<00:00:16.170> think<00:00:16.949> something

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
let out into our world I think something

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.599 
let out into our world I think something
leaking<00:00:18.359> out<00:00:18.539> before<00:00:19.080> we'll<00:00:19.830> come<00:00:20.070> back<00:00:20.310> here

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
leaking out before we'll come back here

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:23.000 
leaking out before we'll come back here
I<00:00:20.640> guess<00:00:20.970> yeah<00:00:21.689> so<00:00:22.320> what<00:00:22.470> I<00:00:22.500> thought<00:00:22.710> we<00:00:22.859> could

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
I guess yeah so what I thought we could

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.130 
I guess yeah so what I thought we could
do<00:00:23.160> is<00:00:23.660> from<00:00:24.660> here

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
do is from here

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.259 
do is from here
we<00:00:25.619> could<00:00:25.800> either<00:00:25.859> do<00:00:26.070> a<00:00:26.099> spiral<00:00:26.519> staircase

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
we could either do a spiral staircase

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.859 
we could either do a spiral staircase
that<00:00:27.300> goes<00:00:27.599> around<00:00:27.750> the<00:00:28.050> edge<00:00:28.080> of<00:00:28.680> stainless

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:29.869 
that goes around the edge of stainless

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:31.880 
that goes around the edge of stainless
but<00:00:30.869> we<00:00:30.990> could<00:00:31.140> do<00:00:31.230> like<00:00:31.320> a<00:00:31.380> double<00:00:31.590> back

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
but we could do like a double back

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.160 
but we could do like a double back
staircase<00:00:32.279> on<00:00:32.700> one<00:00:32.910> side<00:00:33.239> of<00:00:33.270> it<00:00:33.600> what's<00:00:34.079> the

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
staircase on one side of it what's the

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:35.690 
staircase on one side of it what's the
best<00:00:34.350> plan<00:00:34.500> okay<00:00:34.739> dizzy<00:00:34.980> looking<00:00:35.250> up<00:00:35.489> there

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
best plan okay dizzy looking up there

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.150 
best plan okay dizzy looking up there
Simon<00:00:36.690> what<00:00:36.989> we<00:00:37.079> doing<00:00:37.350> so<00:00:37.530> just<00:00:37.800> crouch<00:00:38.010> you
