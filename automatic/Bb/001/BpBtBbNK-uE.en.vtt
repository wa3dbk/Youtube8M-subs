if<00:04:30.740> it's<00:04:30.860> multigrain<00:04:31.340> at<00:04:31.520> this<00:04:31.669> point<00:04:33.430> and<00:04:34.430> who

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:34.790 
if it's multigrain at this point and who

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:38.590 
if it's multigrain at this point and who
would<00:04:35.030> with<00:04:35.389> the<00:04:35.510> product<00:04:35.840> like<00:04:35.990> this<00:04:36.730> but<00:04:37.730> I

would with the product like this but I

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:42.060 
would with the product like this but I
think<00:04:39.350> it's<00:04:39.620> filling<00:04:40.100> I<00:04:40.280> think<00:04:40.880> it's<00:04:41.000> decent<00:04:41.630> I

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:42.070 
think it's filling I think it's decent I

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:44.770 
think it's filling I think it's decent I
think<00:04:43.070> it<00:04:43.400> costs<00:04:43.790> the<00:04:43.880> expectations<00:04:44.510> are<00:04:44.600> so

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:44.780 
think it costs the expectations are so

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:47.020 
think it costs the expectations are so
low<00:04:44.810> yes<00:04:45.350> I<00:04:45.620> think<00:04:45.950> it's<00:04:46.070> kind<00:04:46.250> of<00:04:46.280> bland<00:04:46.610> it

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:47.030 
low yes I think it's kind of bland it

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:48.700 
low yes I think it's kind of bland it
just<00:04:47.210> tastes<00:04:47.360> like<00:04:47.540> buttered<00:04:47.900> chicken<00:04:48.320> really
