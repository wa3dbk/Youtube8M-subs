then obviously your ether hero I mean
you're<00:00:30.720> either<00:00:31.050> of<00:00:31.619> bruggman<00:00:32.189> and<00:00:33.290> this<00:00:34.290> kind

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
you're either of bruggman and this kind

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.560 
you're either of bruggman and this kind
of<00:00:34.770> plastic<00:00:35.250> because<00:00:35.430> it's<00:00:35.880> gonna<00:00:36.030> help<00:00:36.270> you

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
of plastic because it's gonna help you

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:42.139 
of plastic because it's gonna help you
to<00:00:36.840> put<00:00:37.110> all<00:00:37.350> this<00:00:37.890> little<00:00:38.790> screw<00:00:39.090> and<00:00:41.149> like

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
to put all this little screw and like

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:47.110 
to put all this little screw and like
this<00:00:42.450> Dunga<00:00:43.430> plus<00:00:44.430> anything<00:00:45.300> up<00:00:45.840> here<00:00:46.200> screws

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:47.120 
this Dunga plus anything up here screws

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:51.220 
this Dunga plus anything up here screws
so<00:00:48.120> I<00:00:48.600> always<00:00:48.780> have<00:00:49.410> one<00:00:49.800> of<00:00:49.920> these<00:00:50.070> at<00:00:50.280> hand

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:51.230 
so I always have one of these at hand

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:53.990 
so I always have one of these at hand
because<00:00:52.230> we<00:00:52.920> have<00:00:53.100> the<00:00:53.309> different<00:00:53.699> size

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
because we have the different size

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.110 
because we have the different size
screws<00:00:54.510> and<00:00:55.219> it's<00:00:56.219> gonna<00:00:56.370> be<00:00:56.520> complicated<00:00:56.730> so

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
screws and it's gonna be complicated so

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.130 
screws and it's gonna be complicated so
I'll<00:00:57.360> put<00:00:57.629> them<00:00:57.780> on<00:00:58.850> this<00:00:59.850> kind<00:01:00.120> of<00:01:00.239> plastic

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
I'll put them on this kind of plastic

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.140 
I'll put them on this kind of plastic
and<00:01:01.320> it<00:01:01.829> gonna<00:01:02.430> be<00:01:02.579> easier<00:01:03.030> to<00:01:03.210> find<00:01:03.539> and<00:01:03.870> to

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:05.150 
and it gonna be easier to find and to

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:09.859 
and it gonna be easier to find and to
ringing<00:01:06.320> connect<00:01:07.320> on<00:01:07.500> your<00:01:08.240> determine<00:01:09.240> so

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
ringing connect on your determine so

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:14.630 
ringing connect on your determine so
first<00:01:10.229> step<00:01:10.470> we<00:01:11.430> need<00:01:11.490> to<00:01:11.580> unplug<00:01:11.700> the<00:01:13.640> guitar

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
first step we need to unplug the guitar

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.850 
first step we need to unplug the guitar
then<00:01:15.259> remove<00:01:16.259> all<00:01:16.500> the<00:01:17.479> over<00:01:18.479> screws<00:01:18.810> you<00:01:19.290> will

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
then remove all the over screws you will

where are they don't you don't need to

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:29.630 
where are they don't you don't need to
take<00:01:24.000> out<00:01:25.040> this<00:01:26.990> this<00:01:27.990> part<00:01:28.290> will<00:01:28.619> not<00:01:28.650> cut<00:01:29.400> for

us<00:01:30.030> I<00:01:30.240> remember<00:01:30.689> a<00:01:30.900> couple<00:01:31.320> of<00:01:31.590> the<00:01:31.680> script

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
us I remember a couple of the script

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:33.859 
us I remember a couple of the script
years<00:01:32.250> but<00:01:32.820> there's<00:01:33.150> nothing<00:01:33.479> to<00:01:33.630> touch

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
years but there's nothing to touch

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:37.969 
years but there's nothing to touch
yourself<00:01:34.140> don't<00:01:34.890> touch<00:01:35.159> it<00:01:35.630> next<00:01:36.630> and<00:01:36.979> the

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
yourself don't touch it next and the

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.370 
yourself don't touch it next and the
first<00:01:38.250> and<00:01:38.460> major<00:01:39.180> problem<00:01:39.869> of<00:01:39.990> the<00:01:40.170> whammy

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
first and major problem of the whammy

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:47.359 
first and major problem of the whammy
bar<00:01:40.500> is<00:01:41.119> this<00:01:42.119> little<00:01:43.049> piece<00:01:44.240> as<00:01:45.680> you<00:01:46.680> can<00:01:47.130> see

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
bar is this little piece as you can see

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:53.810 
bar is this little piece as you can see
it<00:01:47.970> gets<00:01:48.240> broke<00:01:48.600> really<00:01:49.320> easy<00:01:49.729> so<00:01:50.729> the<00:01:52.820> the

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.179 

he's<00:02:00.700> right<00:02:01.119> here<00:02:01.570> as<00:02:02.530> you<00:02:02.770> can<00:02:02.920> see<00:02:03.100> I'm

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:03.189 
he's right here as you can see I'm

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:05.100 
he's right here as you can see I'm
moving<00:02:03.369> this<00:02:03.909> part<00:02:04.270> and<00:02:04.539> this<00:02:04.689> is<00:02:04.840> the<00:02:04.930> wall

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:05.110 
moving this part and this is the wall

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:09.660 
moving this part and this is the wall
mirror<00:02:05.229> so<00:02:06.570> if<00:02:07.570> I<00:02:07.840> turned<00:02:08.170> this<00:02:08.489> you<00:02:09.489> will

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:09.670 
mirror so if I turned this you will

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:11.940 
mirror so if I turned this you will
notice<00:02:10.060> that<00:02:10.330> you're<00:02:10.989> moving<00:02:11.380> this<00:02:11.530> but

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:11.950 
notice that you're moving this but

why because you need this attached to
this<00:02:16.840> place<00:02:17.140> well<00:02:17.620> I'm<00:02:17.890> gonna<00:02:18.099> show<00:02:18.400> you<00:02:18.459> right

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
this place well I'm gonna show you right

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:22.490 
this place well I'm gonna show you right
now<00:02:18.970> so<00:02:19.720> don't<00:02:20.709> touch<00:02:20.860> anything<00:02:21.250> we<00:02:21.730> have<00:02:21.910> here

now so don't touch anything we have here
this<00:02:23.500> kind<00:02:23.950> of<00:02:24.040> water-borne<00:02:24.790> and<00:02:25.090> the<00:02:25.630> love<00:02:25.810> of

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840 
this kind of water-borne and the love of

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:27.690 
this kind of water-borne and the love of
circuits<00:02:26.560> so<00:02:26.860> don't<00:02:27.099> touch<00:02:27.340> anything

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:27.700 
circuits so don't touch anything

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:32.070 
circuits so don't touch anything
otherwise<00:02:28.660> you<00:02:29.260> can<00:02:29.819> get<00:02:30.819> this<00:02:31.150> electrostatic

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:32.080 
otherwise you can get this electrostatic

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:35.640 
otherwise you can get this electrostatic
charge<00:02:32.950> and<00:02:33.250> to<00:02:34.420> them<00:02:34.599> so<00:02:34.959> don't<00:02:35.260> do<00:02:35.380> it

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.650 
charge and to them so don't do it

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:40.289 
charge and to them so don't do it
so<00:02:36.519> how<00:02:36.730> to<00:02:36.790> take<00:02:37.060> this<00:02:37.410> well<00:02:38.410> the<00:02:39.190> first<00:02:39.430> part

00:02:40.289 --> 00:02:40.299 
so how to take this well the first part

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:43.680 
so how to take this well the first part
of<00:02:40.630> this<00:02:40.900> is<00:02:41.170> very<00:02:41.890> simple<00:02:42.310> just<00:02:42.489> you<00:02:43.360> need<00:02:43.540> to

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:43.690 
of this is very simple just you need to

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:47.820 
of this is very simple just you need to
put<00:02:43.959> this<00:02:44.380> little<00:02:44.890> piece<00:02:46.110> of<00:02:47.110> I<00:02:47.349> don't<00:02:47.769> know

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:47.830
