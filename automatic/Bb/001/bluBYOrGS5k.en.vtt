 Diagram in page 2 of the page books and 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:17.680

 Evaluation on page 2 of the page 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.720
 needed as data source we choose the 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.490
 same quirin also with the diagram 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.590
 in page one of our page book 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.210
 connected is 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:44.250
 We must have this source in our own 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.929
 object new instance your since we for the

 data source object for the drill down 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.600
 and use the initial view 

00:01:52.679 --> 00:01:56.119
 the data would be in the original one 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.799
 change diagram as well

 connect the newly created data source 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:03.899
 We now with the new diagram chart 4 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:06.119

 Presentation of the diagram by 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:17.430

 and open the script in the gate there 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:53.000
 Let's put the behavior of the application 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:54.860
 with a click on one of the diagram 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.930
 to be with a few simple code 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:59.630

 Script takers simplify us by ourselves 

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:07.430
 all objects and the corresponding ones 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:10.150
 command in a drop down box 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:10.150
 provides 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:18.799
 with the first line we set 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:22.810
 use a filter on our data source 

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:22.810
 the chart selected material group 

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:30.510
 the second line of coaching removed 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:32.850
 the outline of the material group 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:36.110
 during line 3 an infusion after 

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:36.110
 adds material number 

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:43.310
 in the last line of coaching 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:46.310
 we jump to the desired page 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:47.989
 of the page book firmly as the internal one 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:50.389
 pages indexes page books at zero 

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:52.129
 We have to start with index 1 as value 

00:03:50.389 --> 00:03:55.599
 set if we go to the second page 

00:03:52.129 --> 00:03:55.599
 of beige books want to jump 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:00.970
 Next we put the visual 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:02.440
 effect firmly with the strings of the page 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:04.989
 buchs should be turned over 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:07.870
 we click in the properties under 

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:09.239
 display of transition effect and choose 

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:11.800
 the slide in animations 

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:14.799
 We also set the page caching 

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:16.449
 worth either or it is with it 

00:04:14.799 --> 00:04:18.519
 all pages of the page book essential 

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:21.820
 be cashed for something more fluid 

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:23.590
 drain ensures the setting loads all 

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:25.750
 pages contained in the page book in the 

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:28.060
 Caches are at the value of 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:31.470
 are just the adjacent ones of each 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:31.470
 active page will be deleted 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:36.960
 Finally, we need the application only 

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:36.960
 still running 

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:44.260
 if we were in chart 1 group one 

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:45.910
 Mark product group now opens 

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:47.560
 the newly created evaluation after 

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:49.949
 tear up the bar from this 

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:49.949
 group 

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:56.080
 with a finger-wiping from left to right 

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:59.070
 on the right we come back to the previous one 

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:59.070
 presentation back
