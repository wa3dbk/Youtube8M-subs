just you know being just enamored with

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:46.780 
just you know being just enamored with
dinosaurs<00:02:44.780> and<00:02:45.170> the<00:02:45.440> fact<00:02:45.709> that<00:02:45.829> these<00:02:46.549> were

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:46.790 
dinosaurs and the fact that these were

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:48.400 
dinosaurs and the fact that these were
real<00:02:47.000> things<00:02:47.269> that<00:02:47.480> existed<00:02:48.140> on<00:02:48.260> the<00:02:48.380> earth

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:48.410 
real things that existed on the earth

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:54.819 
real things that existed on the earth
and<00:02:49.269> you<00:02:50.290> know<00:02:51.290> I<00:02:51.350> just<00:02:51.739> I<00:02:52.130> don't<00:02:52.190> know<00:02:53.829> is

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:54.829 
and you know I just I don't know is

00:02:54.829 --> 00:02:57.729 
and you know I just I don't know is
believing<00:02:55.730> you<00:02:55.940> know<00:02:56.090> it<00:02:56.390> makes<00:02:57.290> it<00:02:57.530> feel<00:02:57.680> so

00:02:57.729 --> 00:02:57.739

believing you know it makes it feel so
so<00:02:58.430> much<00:02:58.549> more<00:02:58.790> real<00:02:59.090> than<00:02:59.450> you<00:03:00.200> know<00:03:00.260> any

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:00.470 
so much more real than you know any

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:05.949 
so much more real than you know any
fossil<00:03:01.370> you<00:03:01.700> know<00:03:02.000> really<00:03:02.299> can<00:03:02.560> so<00:03:04.840> for<00:03:05.840> you<00:03:05.900> to

00:03:05.949 --> 00:03:05.959 
fossil you know really can so for you to

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:08.590 
fossil you know really can so for you to
just<00:03:06.200> have<00:03:06.410> like<00:03:07.220> these<00:03:07.400> little<00:03:07.820> tiny<00:03:08.060> areas

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:08.600 
just have like these little tiny areas

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:10.930 
just have like these little tiny areas
where<00:03:08.959> you<00:03:09.079> can<00:03:09.260> kind<00:03:09.530> of<00:03:09.650> not<00:03:10.519> really<00:03:10.670> do<00:03:10.910> much

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:10.940 
where you can kind of not really do much

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:15.099 
where you can kind of not really do much
with<00:03:11.739> both<00:03:12.739> the<00:03:12.950> Mosasaurus<00:03:13.609> and<00:03:14.480> the<00:03:14.840> Terra

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:15.109

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:43.940 
area already looks like as a cop in copy

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:46.450 
area already looks like as a cop in copy
mode<00:03:44.590> let's<00:03:45.590> turn<00:03:45.860> it<00:03:46.010> on

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:46.460 
mode let's turn it on

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:52.600 
mode let's turn it on
oh<00:03:50.890> my<00:03:51.890> gosh

looks<00:03:53.240> like<00:03:53.360> a<00:03:53.420> little<00:03:53.600> meadow<00:03:57.670> there's<00:03:58.670> a<00:03:58.760> key

00:03:58.900 --> 00:03:58.910 
looks like a little meadow there's a key

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:10.840 
looks like a little meadow there's a key
spasming<00:04:03.040> it's<00:04:04.040> so<00:04:04.190> big<00:04:04.430> now<00:04:04.670> are<00:04:04.700> you<00:04:09.850> so

let's<00:04:11.030> go<00:04:11.120> ahead<00:04:11.209> and<00:04:11.480> turn<00:04:11.690> combo<00:04:12.380> it<00:04:12.500> off

00:04:17.849 --> 00:04:17.859 

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:24.250 

there<00:04:18.859> is<00:04:19.130> also<00:04:19.430> you<00:04:19.640> can<00:04:19.970> do<00:04:20.269> the<00:04:23.260> skeleton

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:24.260 
there is also you can do the skeleton

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:29.530 
there is also you can do the skeleton
version<00:04:25.240> once<00:04:26.240> you<00:04:27.400> unlock<00:04:28.400> the<00:04:28.970> mini<00:04:29.180> kit<00:04:29.450> in

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:29.540 
version once you unlock the mini kit in

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:36.100 
version once you unlock the mini kit in
the<00:04:29.630> game

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:36.110 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:39.580 

now<00:04:37.009> I<00:04:37.039> do<00:04:37.189> have<00:04:37.520> a<00:04:37.550> video<00:04:38.120> already<00:04:38.599> made<00:04:39.169> for

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:39.590 
now I do have a video already made for

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:48.549 
now I do have a video already made for
where<00:04:39.740> you<00:04:39.860> can<00:04:40.039> find

00:04:48.549 --> 00:04:48.559 

00:04:48.559 --> 00:04:51.369 

trying<00:04:49.339> to<00:04:49.459> figure<00:04:49.789> out<00:04:49.999> where<00:04:50.239> that<00:04:50.419> is<00:04:50.479> now

00:04:51.369 --> 00:04:51.379 
trying to figure out where that is now

00:04:51.379 --> 00:04:54.849 
trying to figure out where that is now
while<00:04:51.709> we<00:04:52.869> so<00:04:53.869> it's<00:04:54.049> in<00:04:54.139> the<00:04:54.229> Innovation

00:04:54.849 --> 00:04:54.859 
while we so it's in the Innovation

00:04:54.859 --> 00:05:00.039 
while we so it's in the Innovation
Center<00:04:54.969> a<00:04:57.009> section<00:04:58.009> all<00:04:58.759> the<00:04:59.359> Jurassic<00:04:59.839> world

00:05:00.039 --> 00:05:00.049 
Center a section all the Jurassic world

00:05:00.049 --> 00:05:05.409 
Center a section all the Jurassic world
levels<00:05:02.769> and<00:05:03.769> I<00:05:03.859> believe<00:05:04.489> that<00:05:04.519> that's<00:05:05.209> the

00:05:05.409 --> 00:05:05.419 
levels and I believe that that's the

00:05:05.419 --> 00:05:07.239 
levels and I believe that that's the
same<00:05:05.689> level<00:05:05.959> that<00:05:06.109> you<00:05:06.289> need<00:05:06.529> to<00:05:06.649> get<00:05:06.799> all<00:05:06.979> ten

00:05:07.239 --> 00:05:07.249 
same level that you need to get all ten

00:05:07.249 --> 00:05:11.639 
same level that you need to get all ten
mini<00:05:07.489> kits<00:05:07.929> so<00:05:08.929> you<00:05:09.019> can<00:05:09.199> unlock<00:05:09.349> his<00:05:09.739> skeleton

00:05:11.639 --> 00:05:11.649 
mini kits so you can unlock his skeleton

00:05:11.649 --> 00:05:19.299 
mini kits so you can unlock his skeleton
so<00:05:15.999> there<00:05:16.999> you<00:05:17.179> go<00:05:17.389> the<00:05:17.709> Mosasaurus<00:05:18.709> and<00:05:19.219> I

00:05:19.299 --> 00:05:19.309 
so there you go the Mosasaurus and I

00:05:19.309 --> 00:05:24.129 
so there you go the Mosasaurus and I
also<00:05:19.489> have<00:05:19.849> a<00:05:20.979> custom<00:05:21.979> Mosasaurus<00:05:22.579> I<00:05:23.019> like<00:05:24.019> to

00:05:24.129 --> 00:05:24.139 
also have a custom Mosasaurus I like to

00:05:24.139 --> 00:05:24.909 
also have a custom Mosasaurus I like to
call<00:05:24.349> them

00:05:24.909 --> 00:05:24.919 
call them

00:05:24.919 --> 00:05:37.180 
call them
Darth<00:05:25.339> Moses<00:05:27.819> and<00:05:28.819> here<00:05:29.809> is<00:05:29.989> all<00:05:30.259> sit<00:05:30.589> doubt

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:37.190 

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:39.680 

well<00:05:38.190> yeah<00:05:38.310> now<00:05:38.580> that<00:05:38.610> I<00:05:38.820> have<00:05:38.940> beat<00:05:39.240> the<00:05:39.480> game

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:39.690 
well yeah now that I have beat the game

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:41.629 
well yeah now that I have beat the game
this<00:05:40.080> area<00:05:40.530> like<00:05:40.770> the<00:05:40.920> most<00:05:41.100> interesting

00:05:41.629 --> 00:05:41.639

this area like the most interesting
thing<00:05:41.880> that<00:05:42.030> you<00:05:42.150> could<00:05:42.330> do<00:05:42.510> is<00:05:42.840> have<00:05:44.300> created

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:45.300 
thing that you could do is have created

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:47.570 
thing that you could do is have created
another<00:05:45.480> Mosasaurus<00:05:46.200> and<00:05:46.590> I<00:05:46.830> have<00:05:47.400> it<00:05:47.550> just

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:47.580 
another Mosasaurus and I have it just
