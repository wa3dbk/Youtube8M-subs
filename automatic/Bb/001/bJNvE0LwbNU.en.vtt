00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.959 
do the hack and then we'll see so just
give<00:00:57.930> it<00:00:57.989> a<00:00:58.020> second<00:00:58.379> here<00:00:58.410> let<00:00:58.920> the<00:00:59.039> game<00:00:59.219> load

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
give it a second here let the game load

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:13.520 
give it a second here let the game load
up

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.730

and then key you see that right there
has<00:02:21.730> a<00:02:21.760> zero<00:02:22.709> so<00:02:23.709> that's<00:02:23.860> the<00:02:23.980> amount<00:02:24.100> of<00:02:24.220> coins

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.430 
has a zero so that's the amount of coins

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:28.100

one<00:02:29.110> two<00:02:29.290> three<00:02:29.500> a<00:02:30.100> million<00:02:31.090> there<00:02:31.480> we<00:02:31.540> go

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 
one two three a million there we go

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:36.840 
one two three a million there we go
save<00:02:32.670> cancel<00:02:33.670> done<00:02:34.440> you<00:02:35.440> wanna<00:02:35.730> close<00:02:36.730> the

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:36.850 
save cancel done you wanna close the

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:41.009 
save cancel done you wanna close the
game<00:02:36.970> down<00:02:37.120> and<00:02:37.709> then<00:02:39.390> this<00:02:40.390> is<00:02:40.540> important<00:02:40.959> I

00:02:41.009 --> 00:02:41.019 
game down and then this is important I

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:42.150 
game down and then this is important I
think<00:02:41.260> you<00:02:41.350> have<00:02:41.440> to<00:02:41.560> turn<00:02:41.680> off<00:02:41.739> your<00:02:41.829> Wi-Fi

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:42.160 
think you have to turn off your Wi-Fi

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:43.920 
think you have to turn off your Wi-Fi
before<00:02:42.640> you<00:02:42.700> launch<00:02:42.910> the<00:02:43.030> game<00:02:43.060> but<00:02:43.660> we'll<00:02:43.780> see

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:43.930 
before you launch the game but we'll see

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:46.350 
before you launch the game but we'll see
I<00:02:43.959> won't<00:02:44.170> turn<00:02:44.410> off<00:02:44.440> my<00:02:44.620> wife<00:02:44.769> Lucy<00:02:45.430> okay

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:46.360 
I won't turn off my wife Lucy okay

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:49.740 
I won't turn off my wife Lucy okay
so<00:02:47.079> once<00:02:47.730> the<00:02:48.730> games<00:02:48.940> launched<00:02:49.299> again<00:02:49.510> we'll

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:49.750 
so once the games launched again we'll

00:02:49.750 --> 00:03:00.420 
so once the games launched again we'll
see<00:02:50.019> if<00:02:50.380> it<00:02:51.130> has<00:02:51.370> what

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:00.430
