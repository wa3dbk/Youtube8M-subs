00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:06.760
 good today I'm wall warcraft for 

00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:09.340
 explain how to change the red fire 

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:12.219
 typical of the warlock of the sorcerer for this 

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:14.709
 another green that is a chain of 

00:00:12.219 --> 00:00:16.630
 special emissions for the sorcerer today I'm going 

00:00:14.709 --> 00:00:18.699
 to explain all parts of the mission 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:22.180
 - the last one that kills the last boss that 

00:00:18.699 --> 00:00:24.610
 it's conrad, I'll explain that tomorrow 

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:26.560
 I'll make a video just for that because there's 

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:28.660
 that explain a lot of things if this video 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:30.789
 want to do a little long signa is going to 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:32.199
 start explaining the first thing that 

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:33.789
 we will need to get the 

00:00:32.199 --> 00:00:36.760
 green fire is the tome of the legion 

00:00:33.789 --> 00:00:39.340
 sealed that is achieved by killing rare 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:40.960
 elite on the island of thunder to go to the 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:43.149
 Thunder Island if you do not know you have to go 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:44.890
 to pandaria to the steppes lathe and fence 

00:00:43.149 --> 00:00:46.720
 from the room of sao so you will not have 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:49.360
 missions are some portals that will take 

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:52.480
 until the island here I put a map of 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:54.700
 where are all the rare people on the island 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:56.670
 of thunder manu time to be always 

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:59.680
 that's why they're rare if you have good equipment 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.149
 you do not need help but if you ask 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:03.260
 always help with colleagues and you can not 

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:05.239
 you see that you can not with them 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:07.430
 once we have got the volume of 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:10.310
 the sealed legion we will create a stone 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:13.280
 of health and we will use the tome then 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:15.259
 it will become the serrat codex and 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:16.790
 it will be an object to start a mission that 

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:19.580
 The first thing that he will ask us is that 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:22.580
 let's talk with all our demons like this 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:24.979
 that we will be taking to the diablillo 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:26.630
 succubus if such and talking to them up 

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:28.580
 that we complete the mission after 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:30.140
 this will send us to talk to the 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:32.119
 wizard trainer of our city 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:33.710
 principal that he will ask us to read 

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:37.130
 the writing that is near him in the 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:39.080
 soil and from here they will send us to terra yen 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:42.380
 of a we find four objects and 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:44.689
 let's see two stories 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:46.939
 to find the objects the 

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:49.070
 system of the typical children's game of 

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:51.320
 hot cold cold hot when 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:52.810
 we are in the mission area we are 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:55.360
 will still 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:58.149
 of bus to be called cold when we 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:01.360
 let's get closer, it will change to temperate and 

00:01:58.149 --> 00:02:03.579
 when we are very close it will be hot 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:06.789
 I'm going to put where I found them 

00:02:03.579 --> 00:02:09.610
 I do not all warlogs have it in the 

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:11.140
 same place all sorcerers like this for 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:14.440
 that you have an idea you always have to 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:16.709
 have some demons or sorcerers in the 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:19.150
 infernal fire peninsula I found it 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:21.190
 where I have it marked, which is a 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:22.540
 zone there are demons 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:24.720
 'We searched for roads that 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:27.340
 look for demons and sorcerers remember 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:28.870
 then in the moon shadow valley 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:30.190
 I found it 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:34.400
 right on the dot that I have 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:37.280
 marked that there is a gathering of witches 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:40.129
 as I already went to the mountains of edge 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:42.170
 sword there is already an object and a 

00:02:40.129 --> 00:02:44.450
 cartoon there is like a kind of 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:46.099
 huge invocation circle what 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:48.409
 you find I guess everyone 

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:51.200
 we'll have somewhere nearby and then in the 

00:02:48.409 --> 00:02:52.280
 abyssal storm there is another object and another 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:54.859
 history 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:55.920
 there is also the point where I found 

00:02:54.859 --> 00:02:58.170
 it 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:59.790
 I guess it's very close because I'll have to 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:01.380
 be close to the story after 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:04.770
 this will leave for us to complete the 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:06.959
 mission and this will send us a new one 

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:09.270
 go to the dark temple deed is a 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:11.370
 band that is in the valley of shadow in 

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:14.069
 an old one but instead of entering by 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:15.660
 the door of the band have enabled in 

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:18.600
 the door they have put a drawing that 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:21.239
 we talk to him and he allows us to enter 

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:23.010
 the feat just after entering the deed of 

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:26.220
 dark temple we will be in a room 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:28.319
 long outdoors and there are only two types 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:30.359
 of bugs 

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:31.680
 some little ones that are working and 

00:03:30.359 --> 00:03:33.599
 a few large ones that have an area 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:35.340
 around them that if we enter 

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:37.600
 that area will go for us and we 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:39.820
 will return at the beginning of the deed 

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:41.800
 what we will have to do is easy 

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:44.140
 dodge them until you reach the door 

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:46.330
 of the end that there are two that cover all the 

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:49.120
 ground if we kill one of the 

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:51.070
 little ones that approach fast will leave them 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:52.240
 running to see what happens we we 

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:54.760
 we will ride in our saddle and 

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:56.200
 we will go through the hole that he leaves in the 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:58.780
 next room they will ask us to 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:01.360
 let's find one more object to find 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:03.400
 We will see that it is false because it is there 

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:05.890
 to cheat and the camera will come and we 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:08.620
 will tell a story that does not interest us 

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:10.750
 one so it's cool but I'm not going 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:14.380
 to tell the bird and each one of his and 

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:16.210
 then we will follow them until a few 

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:18.580
 those that only see spirits but if 

00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:20.500
 we use the eye of kid rock we will see that 

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:23.260
 is full of traps here what you 

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:25.390
 I recommend that you take the glyph of the 

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:28.360
 shooting eye that allows us to use with the 

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:31.110
 eye the demonic doors and let's go with 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:33.360
 the eye to a point 

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:35.070
 pretty clear of traps and we 

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:38.280
 we put the door and go through the 

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:40.110
 wings if until the end at the end there will be 

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:42.000
 another room that there will be an event and it will come out 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:43.590
 a boss that we will have to kill is 

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.210
 quite simple to remove it from the 

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:48.920
 fires and kill the little bugs that go 

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:51.560
 taking out and it's already not much alive 

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:54.530
 after killing him they will give us an object and 

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:55.880
 we will get back with the bed and it will be 

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:57.620
 go back the way we've done 

00:04:55.880 --> 00:05:00.080
 but there will be no cheating but be careful 

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:02.090
 with the bugs that there are because they call 

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:05.590
 many bugs and it can complicate a 

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:05.590
 little thing to kill them 

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:09.960
 when we get to bed he will go for his 

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:12.090
 side and he will send us for the 

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:14.490
 path that we have come with him but that 

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:16.890
 let's go the way of the guard in 

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:19.920
 the lair of mortal pleasures by 

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:21.900
 the road we will pick up objects that 

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:24.420
 then later they will tell us what they are worth 

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:27.780
 in selling them 

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:30.780
 are worth one that each 15 golds or things 

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:34.020
 So when we get to the end of the road 

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:36.540
 of the deadly pleasures there will be a chest 

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:38.100
 and we will talk with him we will deliver the 

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:40.920
 mission will tell us what it is worth what we have 

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:42.950
 picked up and will already ask us the last part 

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:45.540
 let's go to the top of the temple 

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:47.580
 We enter through the next door 

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:50.850
 we will go up to the top of the temple and 

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:53.850
 will ask us to kill them fall straight that 

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:56.980
 is what I will explain tomorrow because it has 

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:58.960
 much preparation more than anything else 

00:05:56.980 --> 00:06:00.910
 it's complicated but we're going to base 

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:03.040
 attempts is achieved and nothing I hope that 

00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:07.230
 the video serve you like it and tomorrow 

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:07.230
 I will kill the last boss is tomorrow
