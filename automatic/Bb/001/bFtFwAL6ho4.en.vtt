00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:13.460
 we are already back in blow to blow 

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:16.450
 special edition from the beautiful 

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:16.450
 instant 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:27.250
 from blow to blow are two fighters and 

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:29.949
 so many times have you seen gentlemen of 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:33.610
 in a few more minutes we are here I do not 

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:36.309
 they smell to me I would like nothing to listen 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:40.290
 your forecasts before it all comes 

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:43.710
 this maelstrom of people and comments 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.710
 how do you imagine 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:51.159
 sick as you have to do the 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:52.870
 year after year in a single fight we have 

00:00:51.159 --> 00:00:54.699
 few opportunities to see to equal 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:56.799
 I'm a ring, I think I was going to see it 

00:00:54.699 --> 00:00:59.680
 favorite I imagine that ghost 

00:00:56.799 --> 00:01:02.769
 warrior will seek to press the combat and 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:07.210
 I find that the highest quality criticism 

00:01:02.769 --> 00:01:09.460
 Mark technique I do not see a fight 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:11.830
 long but a spiteful fight round 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:14.560
 in favor of mayweather a triumph for 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:17.380
 knockout before the sixth round where 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:19.659
 it shows to me that the swamp 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:22.240
 warrior does not have the credentials to 

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:26.270
 go up and in this case defeat a 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:28.439
 historical engine like you as the same 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:30.450
 for both as I said but more 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:32.460
 difficult for the ghost to swim for the 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.259
 style of the problem but how many more 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.600
 big leagues penetrate the guards and 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:38.399
 the combinations we do not know what common 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.409
 as some more reason has been prepared in 

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:41.909
 as to speed more under pressure but if 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:43.560
 missing marketers work more the 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:45.959
 speeds well be pushing to 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:48.509
 any combination of hits with 

00:01:45.959 --> 00:01:50.280
 speed thanks important points if 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:52.770
 I make it very difficult for back more 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:56.869
 as david says the new affiliate will 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.869
 he won the opportunity for winning 

00:01:58.039 --> 00:02:03.209
 then stand out a big fight yes 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.429
 but to my point of view floyd 

00:02:03.209 --> 00:02:07.500
 mayweather not by location by decision 

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:09.899
 by points because it is not a form and 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.790
 good is a fighter fighter is not a 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:13.650
 fighter who has stuck very strong 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:15.450
 apart they put fourth best practice 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:18.390
 back and the problem is that the 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:20.489
 accumulation of blows also monitors there 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:23.819
 what to see counted suffered a lot in the last 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:25.530
 episode of illness do not create what 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:27.690
 happens is that the physical world of color 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:29.190
 numeral of the best then I 'm not going 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:31.400
 talk about him really shares 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:34.770
 depression 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:37.350
 from the first to the ninth round being 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:39.000
 the expression that he used well those 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:41.100
 last rounds waiting for cost in 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.870
 short and connecting you 11 missing 9 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:45.480
 importance of four fires its 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:47.910
 maximum effort and could not really not 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:49.410
 We saw a bad story that night and did not 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:51.239
 he could eat nine famous artists 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:54.510
 faces of the pot that lost front 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:57.569
 to mayweather who know him who believe 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:59.370
 that the 36 years the legs of de wever 

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:01.620
 they're going to start to say that we're going to 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:04.200
 start to see the first vestiges of the 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:05.400
 weather impact on mayweather also 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:07.260
 it's a good opportunity because there's no 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:09.330
 invincible plan 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:11.640
 there are miracles of agreement where I do not like 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:16.670
 39 year old counter very well prepared 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:16.670
 distinctly well very well 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:35.280
 when you have the care of the 48 years 

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:36.840
 you do not have the cares 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:39.840
 in the ring, then you can spend 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:42.180
 now a lot of tension in combat 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:44.700
 previous of robert guerrero he faced 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:47.040
 to an Andre Berto who put into practice 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:50.670
 defense of floyd mayweather in zolder 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:54.000
 roll if away from the level of which 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:58.010
 presents smells me but he broke it like 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.010
 crystal completely
