00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:09.350 
trolling but if you do end up as falling

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:11.380 
trolling but if you do end up as falling
down<00:01:09.530> the<00:01:09.620> ladder<00:01:09.800> a<00:01:09.920> little<00:01:10.160> bit<00:01:10.250> more<00:01:10.430> or<00:01:10.640> go

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:11.390 
down the ladder a little bit more or go

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:13.300 
down the ladder a little bit more or go
and<00:01:11.510> down<00:01:11.660> it<00:01:11.840> you<00:01:12.230> actually<00:01:12.590> start<00:01:12.800> to<00:01:12.890> go

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:13.310 
and down it you actually start to go

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:15.700 
and down it you actually start to go
under<00:01:13.580> them<00:01:13.700> up<00:01:13.820> and<00:01:14.030> you<00:01:14.210> fall<00:01:14.480> for<00:01:14.720> it<00:01:14.810> and<00:01:14.990> I

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:15.710 
under them up and you fall for it and I

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:17.590 
under them up and you fall for it and I
guess<00:01:15.950> it's<00:01:16.160> quite<00:01:16.400> an<00:01:16.610> easy<00:01:16.820> way<00:01:17.120> to<00:01:17.150> get<00:01:17.510> the
