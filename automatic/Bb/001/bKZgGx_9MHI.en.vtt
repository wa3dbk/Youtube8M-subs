00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:55.590 
reactivated I guess is the best way to
say<00:03:48.220> and<00:03:48.730> um<00:03:50.910> you<00:03:51.910> can<00:03:52.090> kind<00:03:52.329> of<00:03:54.000> get<00:03:55.000> it<00:03:55.150> to<00:03:55.299> pop

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:55.600 
say and um you can kind of get it to pop

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:57.660 
say and um you can kind of get it to pop
up<00:03:55.840> again<00:03:56.049> and<00:03:56.500> be<00:03:56.709> more<00:03:56.890> full<00:03:57.190> just<00:03:57.489> by<00:03:57.610> doing

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:57.670 
up again and be more full just by doing

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:00.270 
up again and be more full just by doing
that<00:03:58.000> which<00:03:58.209> i<00:03:58.360> think<00:03:58.420> is<00:03:58.690> wonderful<00:03:59.049> as<00:03:59.920> well

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:00.280 
that which i think is wonderful as well

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:01.530 
that which i think is wonderful as well
so<00:04:00.340> I<00:04:00.400> think<00:04:00.519> if<00:04:00.640> you<00:04:00.730> have<00:04:00.850> longer<00:04:01.060> hair<00:04:01.239> it's

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:01.540 
so I think if you have longer hair it's

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:02.970 
so I think if you have longer hair it's
