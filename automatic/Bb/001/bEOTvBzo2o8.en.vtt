00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.639
 but we're not going to use a black marker we're going to use a color like this 

00:00:03.639 --> 00:00:06.639
 the attentive red color 

00:00:09.429 --> 00:00:13.910
 to see if you guess what I'm going to draw remember that whatever the color is not 

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:16.369
 is he who uses 

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:19.369
 I have usually changed it 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:27.210
 how about 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.210
 the beast 

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:38.580
 manic art time is running out 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:46.160
 you guessed it is a motorcyclist 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:53.500
 finally the stripes of the tire 

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:57.330
 here 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.350
 we already have the outline in red and now we are going to paint it 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.140
 foye and do not be overwhelmed and you do not have the colors that correspond to each section 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:15.140
 you can change the colors because we're going to go 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:18.460
 devise new rules 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:21.750
 is that this is high art 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.090
 for example I will try peak 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:29.460
 noticing the pink helmet where you've seen a motorcyclist helmet that 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.460
 be pink etc you know I ran out of black so you 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:37.770
 it will have to be pink and when you paint with changed colors you do not have to 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.770
 do very carefully as you would normally 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.800
 pint look with scribbles 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:47.190
 I will use yellow for the face 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:50.190
 and the orange for the leather jacket 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:54.280
 Keep it up and use any color you like 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:59.200
 for example 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:00.280
 green over here
