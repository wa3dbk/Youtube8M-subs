00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:36.610 
messing up and then when you have that

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:39.860 
messing up and then when you have that
yours<00:02:36.850> cannot<00:02:38.040> push<00:02:39.040> down<00:02:39.220> the<00:02:39.250> middle<00:02:39.459> part

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
yours cannot push down the middle part

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:43.890 
yours cannot push down the middle part
fold<00:02:40.870> everything<00:02:41.049> down<00:02:41.470> so<00:02:42.360> the<00:02:43.360> creases<00:02:43.780> are

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:43.900 
fold everything down so the creases are

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:46.140 
fold everything down so the creases are
really<00:02:44.170> smooth<00:02:44.440> and<00:02:44.850> then<00:02:45.850> you're<00:02:45.970> going<00:02:46.060> to

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.150 
really smooth and then you're going to

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:49.710 
really smooth and then you're going to
have<00:02:46.440> something<00:02:47.440> like<00:02:47.560> this<00:02:47.680> and<00:02:48.570> can<00:02:49.570> have

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:49.720 
have something like this and can have

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:55.009 
have something like this and can have
that<00:02:49.930> part<00:02:50.230> under<00:02:51.810> and<00:02:52.810> then<00:02:53.440> you're<00:02:54.220> going<00:02:54.340> to

00:02:55.009 --> 00:02:55.019 
that part under and then you're going to

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:59.729 
that part under and then you're going to
fold<00:02:56.019> up<00:02:56.320> these<00:02:56.950> parts<00:02:58.230> so<00:02:59.230> it's<00:02:59.410> like<00:02:59.470> going

00:02:59.729 --> 00:02:59.739 
fold up these parts so it's like going

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:19.570 
fold up these parts so it's like going
to<00:02:59.799> be<00:02:59.920> a<00:02:59.950> little<00:03:00.220> diamond<00:03:01.680> right

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:19.580 

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:23.570 

then<00:03:20.580> once<00:03:20.819> you<00:03:20.970> have<00:03:21.120> that<00:03:21.560> gonna<00:03:22.560> fold<00:03:23.459> this

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:23.580 
then once you have that gonna fold this

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:29.930 
then once you have that gonna fold this
part<00:03:23.910> found<00:03:28.010> right<00:03:29.010> to<00:03:29.310> the<00:03:29.430> end<00:03:29.580> of<00:03:29.849> the

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:29.940 
part found right to the end of the

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:31.039 
part found right to the end of the
diamond<00:03:30.299> so<00:03:30.450> it's<00:03:30.569> going<00:03:30.690> to<00:03:30.780> be<00:03:30.840> a<00:03:30.870> little

00:03:31.039 --> 00:03:31.049 
diamond so it's going to be a little

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:35.809 
diamond so it's going to be a little
triangle<00:03:32.299> this<00:03:34.190> you<00:03:35.190> want<00:03:35.340> to<00:03:35.400> make<00:03:35.489> this

00:03:35.809 --> 00:03:35.819 
triangle this you want to make this

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:39.830 
triangle this you want to make this
crease<00:03:36.799> as<00:03:37.799> smooth<00:03:38.730> as<00:03:38.849> you<00:03:38.970> can<00:03:39.150> get<00:03:39.569> it<00:03:39.660> to

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 
crease as smooth as you can get it to

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:43.070 
crease as smooth as you can get it to
try<00:03:40.049> and<00:03:40.080> smooth<00:03:40.530> it<00:03:40.620> out<00:03:40.739> really<00:03:41.640> well<00:03:42.080> now

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:22.879 
you have that you're going to fold these
parts<00:04:20.400> down<00:04:20.789> to<00:04:21.060> make<00:04:21.209> the<00:04:21.329> ones<00:04:21.650> just<00:04:22.650> fold

00:04:22.879 --> 00:04:22.889 
parts down to make the ones just fold

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:24.529 
parts down to make the ones just fold
them<00:04:22.979> down<00:04:23.010> about<00:04:23.340> as<00:04:23.639> far<00:04:23.880> as<00:04:24.060> you<00:04:24.180> want<00:04:24.389> them

00:04:24.529 --> 00:04:24.539 
them down about as far as you want them

00:04:24.539 --> 00:04:27.140 
them down about as far as you want them
it<00:04:24.810> doesn't<00:04:25.139> really<00:04:25.229> matter<00:04:25.789> how<00:04:26.789> far<00:04:27.120> you

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:27.150 
it doesn't really matter how far you

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:29.779 
it doesn't really matter how far you
fold<00:04:27.450> them<00:04:27.570> down<00:04:28.190> so<00:04:29.190> you<00:04:29.310> won't<00:04:29.340> have<00:04:29.610> them

00:04:29.779 --> 00:04:29.789 
fold them down so you won't have them

00:04:29.789 --> 00:04:31.940 
fold them down so you won't have them
far<00:04:29.970> down<00:04:30.210> far<00:04:30.750> down<00:04:31.139> like<00:04:31.349> enough<00:04:31.650> so<00:04:31.860> the

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:31.950 
far down far down like enough so the

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:34.790 
far down far down like enough so the
wings<00:04:32.160> going<00:04:32.460> to<00:04:32.520> be<00:04:32.580> big<00:04:32.760> enough<00:04:33.080> click<00:04:34.080> this

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:34.800 
wings going to be big enough click this

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:40.580 
wings going to be big enough click this
is<00:04:34.950> good<00:04:35.160> right<00:04:35.190> here<00:04:38.240> and<00:04:39.240> then<00:04:40.139> just<00:04:40.349> do<00:04:40.500> the

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:40.590 
is good right here and then just do the

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:47.990 
is good right here and then just do the
same<00:04:40.800> on<00:04:40.979> the<00:04:41.250> other<00:04:41.280> side<00:04:45.710> and<00:04:46.760> make<00:04:47.760> these

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:48.000 
same on the other side and make these

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.480 
same on the other side and make these
folds<00:04:48.510> really<00:04:49.020> smooth<00:04:49.289> like<00:04:50.070> with<00:04:50.250> all<00:04:50.400> the

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:50.490 
folds really smooth like with all the

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:52.969 
folds really smooth like with all the
ones<00:04:50.639> all<00:04:51.240> the<00:04:51.450> folds<00:04:51.810> and<00:04:52.650> then<00:04:52.740> you're<00:04:52.889> going

00:04:52.969 --> 00:04:52.979 
ones all the folds and then you're going

00:04:52.979 --> 00:04:55.909 
ones all the folds and then you're going
to<00:04:53.039> have<00:04:53.130> something<00:04:53.610> like<00:04:53.940> this<00:04:54.650> it's<00:04:55.650> not

00:04:55.909 --> 00:04:55.919 
to have something like this it's not

00:04:55.919 --> 00:05:00.589 
to have something like this it's not
going<00:04:56.070> to<00:04:56.160> fly<00:04:56.400> yet<00:04:57.320> but<00:04:58.320> it<00:04:58.410> will<00:04:58.440> fly<00:04:58.889> soon<00:04:59.599> so

00:05:00.589 --> 00:05:00.599 
going to fly yet but it will fly soon so

00:05:00.599 --> 00:05:02.960 
going to fly yet but it will fly soon so
you're<00:05:00.690> going<00:05:00.780> to<00:05:00.870> fold<00:05:01.080> up<00:05:01.289> little<00:05:02.039> parts<00:05:02.340> on

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:02.970 
you're going to fold up little parts on

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:08.620 
you're going to fold up little parts on
the<00:05:03.690> winds

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:08.630 

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:14.900 

like<00:05:09.630> this<00:05:12.680> you<00:05:13.680> add<00:05:13.979> to<00:05:14.100> both<00:05:14.220> sides<00:05:14.460> and<00:05:14.699> try

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:14.910 
like this you add to both sides and try

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:28.840 
like this you add to both sides and try
and<00:05:14.970> make<00:05:15.120> them<00:05:15.350> about<00:05:16.350> the<00:05:16.620> same<00:05:26.570> and<00:05:27.570> then

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:28.850

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:40.800 
flaps don't make them too big you can

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:43.400 
flaps don't make them too big you can
tear<00:05:41.039> this<00:05:41.190> too<00:05:41.490> I<00:05:41.820> did<00:05:42.720> that<00:05:42.870> my<00:05:43.080> other<00:05:43.260> ones

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:51.930 
i'm going to cut and so you're going to

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:53.540 
i'm going to cut and so you're going to
have<00:05:51.990> a<00:05:52.110> little<00:05:52.229> box<00:05:52.710> that<00:05:53.039> come<00:05:53.280> off<00:05:53.310> like

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:53.550

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:56.300 
have a little box that come off like
this<00:05:54.050> down<00:05:55.050> both<00:05:55.320> sides<00:05:55.350> again<00:05:55.860> try<00:05:56.100> to<00:05:56.160> make

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:56.310 
this down both sides again try to make

they're going up like this and then you

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:22.730 
they're going up like this and then you
can<00:06:20.190> keep<00:06:20.760> it<00:06:20.910> like<00:06:21.030> this<00:06:21.139> just<00:06:22.139> try<00:06:22.289> flying<00:06:22.530> it

00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:22.740 
can keep it like this just try flying it

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:24.589 
can keep it like this just try flying it
around<00:06:22.949> for<00:06:23.760> a<00:06:23.820> little<00:06:23.940> bit<00:06:24.060> you<00:06:24.270> can<00:06:24.389> pause

00:06:24.589 --> 00:06:24.599 
around for a little bit you can pause

00:06:24.599 --> 00:06:28.580 
around for a little bit you can pause
the<00:06:24.870> video<00:06:24.960> and<00:06:25.380> just<00:06:25.940> fly<00:06:26.940> it<00:06:27.000> around<00:06:27.590> like

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:28.590 
the video and just fly it around like

00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:30.950 
the video and just fly it around like
this<00:06:28.650> a<00:06:28.860> little<00:06:29.099> bit<00:06:29.310> but<00:06:30.000> and<00:06:30.270> it<00:06:30.510> still<00:06:30.780> works

00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:30.960 
this a little bit but and it still works

this a little bit but and it still works
it<00:06:31.530> still<00:06:31.740> works<00:06:31.919> great<00:06:32.220> but<00:06:32.430> I<00:06:32.580> like<00:06:32.880> adding

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:33.330 
it still works great but I like adding

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:37.719 
it still works great but I like adding
one<00:06:33.479> thing<00:06:33.690> to<00:06:33.810> help<00:06:33.960> it<00:06:34.460> ride<00:06:35.460> sometimes<00:06:36.030> so

00:06:37.719 --> 00:06:37.729 
one thing to help it ride sometimes so

00:06:37.729 --> 00:06:40.790 
one thing to help it ride sometimes so
I'm<00:06:38.729> going<00:06:38.760> to<00:06:38.940> have<00:06:39.120> the<00:06:39.539> bottom<00:06:39.900> right<00:06:40.590> here

00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:40.800 
I'm going to have the bottom right here

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:43.430 
I'm going to have the bottom right here
and<00:06:41.010> then<00:06:41.699> near<00:06:42.240> the<00:06:42.270> end<00:06:42.449> you're<00:06:43.199> going<00:06:43.349> to

00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:43.440 
and then near the end you're going to

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:46.250 
and then near the end you're going to
cut<00:06:43.770> a<00:06:43.949> little<00:06:44.370> thing<00:06:44.729> and<00:06:44.970> the<00:06:45.930> place<00:06:46.139> where

00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:46.260 
cut a little thing and the place where

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:49.000 
cut a little thing and the place where
you<00:06:46.349> hold<00:06:46.530> it<00:06:46.849> look<00:06:47.849> it's<00:06:48.030> going<00:06:48.180> to<00:06:48.240> be<00:06:48.389> just

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:49.010 
you hold it look it's going to be just

00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:52.640 
you hold it look it's going to be just
the<00:06:50.010> bottom<00:06:50.310> right<00:06:50.460> here<00:06:50.780> and<00:06:51.780> there's<00:06:52.500> going

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:52.650 
the bottom right here and there's going

00:06:52.650 --> 00:06:55.010 
the bottom right here and there's going
to<00:06:52.710> be<00:06:52.740> a<00:06:52.800> little<00:06:52.949> part<00:06:53.220> that<00:06:53.370> you<00:06:53.460> cut<00:06:54.020> now

00:06:55.010 --> 00:06:55.020 
to be a little part that you cut now

00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:58.010 
to be a little part that you cut now
you're<00:06:55.169> going<00:06:55.289> to<00:06:55.349> fold<00:06:55.470> this<00:06:55.710> up<00:06:56.870> through<00:06:57.870> the

00:06:58.010 --> 00:06:58.020 
you're going to fold this up through the

00:06:58.020 --> 00:07:00.670 
you're going to fold this up through the
middle<00:06:58.229> so<00:06:58.860> it<00:06:58.889> sticking<00:06:59.280> up<00:06:59.430> at<00:06:59.580> the<00:06:59.639> top<00:06:59.849> and

00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:00.680 
middle so it sticking up at the top and

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:03.230 
middle so it sticking up at the top and
then<00:07:01.680> you're<00:07:01.889> going<00:07:01.979> to<00:07:02.070> fold<00:07:02.400> so<00:07:02.880> it<00:07:03.000> goes

00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:03.240 
then you're going to fold so it goes

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:06.529 
then you're going to fold so it goes
with<00:07:03.599> the<00:07:03.750> lines<00:07:03.960> of<00:07:04.169> the<00:07:04.229> plane<00:07:05.180> hold<00:07:06.180> it<00:07:06.389> so

00:07:06.529 --> 00:07:06.539 
with the lines of the plane hold it so

00:07:06.539 --> 00:07:24.150 
with the lines of the plane hold it so
different<00:07:06.750> curve<00:07:07.020> up<00:07:07.139> the<00:07:07.289> wings<00:07:07.530> at<00:07:07.740> all

00:07:24.150 --> 00:07:24.160

be<00:07:39.650> like<00:07:39.710> this<00:07:39.890> bottom<00:07:40.700> is<00:07:40.760> going<00:07:40.910> to<00:07:40.970> be<00:07:41.090> like

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:41.270 
be like this bottom is going to be like

00:07:41.270 --> 00:07:43.030 
be like this bottom is going to be like
this<00:07:41.660> is<00:07:41.870> when<00:07:42.020> a<00:07:42.110> part<00:07:42.350> cut<00:07:42.500> off<00:07:42.590> right<00:07:42.800> here
