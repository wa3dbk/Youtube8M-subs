00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:06.170
 I do not know how they see it 

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:12.950
 always one has to drop the 

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:14.990
 reagents house notes cards 

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:17.830
 and the reagent is always first and 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:17.830
 then the sample 

00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:22.660
 with the title of this one 

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:35.930
 the national title 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:01:00.100
 with young people 

00:00:56.130 --> 00:01:02.700
 we have to think about how to use the 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:06.890
 Droplets in a link tour 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:06.890
 and of the people 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:15.490
 it's positive 

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:27.430
 and over inspection to the bad 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:27.430
 but this positive point has everything 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:48.979
 in this way and therefore with both 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:50.990
 now 400 microliters of the part 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:57.140
 extraction for about two or three colonies 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:02:05.200
 in Cuba 37 degrees yes everything we all 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:05.200
 those who are 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:10.770
 It is by nules
