digesting liquid nutrition and a lot of
people<00:01:00.840> are<00:01:01.050> confused<00:01:01.620> when<00:01:01.890> it<00:01:02.010> comes<00:01:02.250> to

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
people are confused when it comes to

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.620 
people are confused when it comes to
protein<00:01:03.480> shakes<00:01:03.750> in<00:01:03.930> general<00:01:04.350> but<00:01:04.920> basically

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:05.630 
protein shakes in general but basically

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:08.480 
protein shakes in general but basically
protein<00:01:06.630> drinks<00:01:07.020> are<00:01:07.350> simply<00:01:07.860> made<00:01:08.100> from

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
protein drinks are simply made from

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.640 
protein drinks are simply made from
dairy<00:01:08.760> products<00:01:09.270> most<00:01:09.600> of<00:01:09.780> the<00:01:09.869> time<00:01:10.020> milk<00:01:10.409> and

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
dairy products most of the time milk and

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.950 
dairy products most of the time milk and
eggs<00:01:11.070> I<00:01:11.400> mean<00:01:12.000> you<00:01:12.090> can<00:01:12.270> get<00:01:12.360> other<00:01:12.510> types<00:01:12.600> of

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
eggs I mean you can get other types of

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.260 
eggs I mean you can get other types of
protein<00:01:13.500> powders<00:01:13.890> like<00:01:14.100> now<00:01:14.610> there's<00:01:14.939> beef

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
protein powders like now there's beef

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:16.820 
protein powders like now there's beef
protein<00:01:15.780> is<00:01:15.960> another<00:01:16.170> one<00:01:16.350> that's<00:01:16.470> coming<00:01:16.740> out

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
protein is another one that's coming out

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.740 
protein is another one that's coming out
in<00:01:16.979> vegetable<00:01:17.460> protein<00:01:17.850> and<00:01:18.030> soy<00:01:18.119> protein<00:01:18.420> but

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
in vegetable protein and soy protein but

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.960 
in vegetable protein and soy protein but
for<00:01:19.320> the<00:01:19.409> majority<00:01:19.500> the<00:01:20.159> most<00:01:20.490> protein

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
for the majority the most protein

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.580 
for the majority the most protein
powders<00:01:21.360> that<00:01:21.390> you're<00:01:21.840> going<00:01:21.960> to<00:01:21.990> find<00:01:22.140> are

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
powders that you're going to find are

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.100 
powders that you're going to find are
made<00:01:22.920> from<00:01:23.100> either<00:01:23.340> milk<00:01:23.729> or<00:01:24.000> eggs<00:01:24.390> as<00:01:24.750> the<00:01:24.960> raw

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
made from either milk or eggs as the raw

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.130 
made from either milk or eggs as the raw
ingredients<00:01:25.280> so<00:01:26.280> these<00:01:26.850> are<00:01:27.180> natural<00:01:27.450> it's

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
ingredients so these are natural it's

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.770 
ingredients so these are natural it's
not<00:01:28.380> like<00:01:28.590> taking<00:01:28.799> steroids<00:01:29.460> if<00:01:30.299> you<00:01:30.540> have

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
not like taking steroids if you have

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.510 
not like taking steroids if you have
protein<00:01:31.200> shakes<00:01:31.470> it<00:01:31.650> doesn't<00:01:31.950> mean<00:01:32.100> you<00:01:32.340> are<00:01:32.369> a

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
protein shakes it doesn't mean you are a

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.730 
protein shakes it doesn't mean you are a
non<00:01:32.970> natural<00:01:33.270> bodybuilder<00:01:34.140> or<00:01:34.320> anything<00:01:34.500> like

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
non natural bodybuilder or anything like

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.670 
non natural bodybuilder or anything like
that<00:01:34.799> it's<00:01:35.460> just<00:01:35.610> all<00:01:36.150> protein<00:01:37.140> powder<00:01:37.409> is

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
that it's just all protein powder is

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.160 
that it's just all protein powder is
it's<00:01:38.070> taking<00:01:38.610> these<00:01:38.970> raw<00:01:39.509> materials<00:01:39.540> like

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
it's taking these raw materials like

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.280 
it's taking these raw materials like
dairy<00:01:40.560> eggs<00:01:40.890> or<00:01:41.130> whatever<00:01:41.220> and<00:01:41.990> isolating<00:01:42.990> the

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
dairy eggs or whatever and isolating the

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.980 
dairy eggs or whatever and isolating the
protein<00:01:43.770> and<00:01:44.040> so<00:01:44.640> you<00:01:44.700> get<00:01:44.909> the<00:01:45.030> protein<00:01:45.420> from

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
protein and so you get the protein from

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.249 
protein and so you get the protein from
milk<00:01:46.320> and<00:01:46.619> eggs<00:01:47.060> without<00:01:48.060> the<00:01:48.240> fat<00:01:48.450> the<00:01:48.899> sugar

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
milk and eggs without the fat the sugar

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:50.810 
milk and eggs without the fat the sugar
and<00:01:49.380> the<00:01:49.470> lactose<00:01:49.890> and<00:01:50.100> all<00:01:50.189> that<00:01:50.399> stuff

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
and the lactose and all that stuff

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.200 
and the lactose and all that stuff
so<00:01:51.030> it's<00:01:51.479> natural<00:01:52.310> stuff<00:01:53.310> now<00:01:53.729> I<00:01:53.790> know<00:01:53.909> that's

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
so it's natural stuff now I know that's

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:55.730 
so it's natural stuff now I know that's
probably<00:01:54.329> pretty<00:01:54.659> basic<00:01:54.930> and<00:01:55.290> most<00:01:55.380> people

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
probably pretty basic and most people

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.010 
probably pretty basic and most people
know<00:01:56.040> that<00:01:56.070> but<00:01:56.310> hey<00:01:56.909> this<00:01:57.149> is<00:01:57.210> youtube<00:01:57.689> and<00:01:57.930> I

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
if they take a protein shake they're

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:04.190 
if they take a protein shake they're
gonna<00:02:02.759> be<00:02:02.909> you<00:02:03.119> know<00:02:03.180> that's<00:02:03.420> not<00:02:03.600> natural<00:02:03.840> or

but<00:02:44.550> a<00:02:44.790> good<00:02:45.390> rule<00:02:45.660> of<00:02:45.690> thumb<00:02:45.840> for<00:02:45.990> the

your insulin levels which is okay

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:24.620 
your insulin levels which is okay
post-workout<00:03:23.610> will<00:03:23.940> help<00:03:24.060> to<00:03:24.150> shuttle<00:03:24.510> those

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:24.630 
post-workout will help to shuttle those

are just very rapidly absorbed amino

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:18.409 
are just very rapidly absorbed amino
acids<00:04:16.620> and<00:04:16.859> they<00:04:17.250> help<00:04:17.430> to<00:04:17.609> increase<00:04:17.790> protein

00:04:18.409 --> 00:04:18.419 
acids and they help to increase protein

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:20.840 
acids and they help to increase protein
synthesis<00:04:19.049> and<00:04:19.200> they<00:04:19.799> go<00:04:19.980> right<00:04:20.220> to<00:04:20.489> your

and that's the ones that I use a lot the
thing<00:05:16.410> I<00:05:16.530> like<00:05:16.710> about<00:05:16.860> their<00:05:17.460> protein<00:05:17.910> powder

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:18.150 
thing I like about their protein powder

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:20.990 
thing I like about their protein powder
they're<00:05:18.450> I<00:05:18.630> so<00:05:18.870> smooth<00:05:19.170> is<00:05:19.440> it's<00:05:20.100> a<00:05:20.250> four<00:05:20.640> blend

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:21.000 
they're I so smooth is it's a four blend

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.840 
they're I so smooth is it's a four blend
protein<00:05:21.750> powder<00:05:21.960> so<00:05:22.500> though<00:05:22.650> you'll<00:05:22.860> get<00:05:23.100> fast

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:23.850 
protein powder so though you'll get fast

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:26.510 
protein powder so though you'll get fast
medium<00:05:24.600> and<00:05:24.810> slow<00:05:25.020> digesting<00:05:25.830> proteins<00:05:26.280> it

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:26.520 
medium and slow digesting proteins it

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:29.060 
medium and slow digesting proteins it
has<00:05:26.640> a<00:05:26.670> combination<00:05:26.970> of<00:05:27.390> whey<00:05:27.810> isolate<00:05:28.410> it<00:05:28.710> has

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:29.070 
has a combination of whey isolate it has

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:32.150 
has a combination of whey isolate it has
milk<00:05:29.640> isolate<00:05:30.180> casein<00:05:31.110> isolate<00:05:31.590> and<00:05:31.800> egg

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:32.160 
milk isolate casein isolate and egg

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:34.580 
milk isolate casein isolate and egg
protein<00:05:32.670> isolate<00:05:33.090> so<00:05:33.240> you<00:05:33.300> get<00:05:33.480> a<00:05:33.630> blend<00:05:34.290> of

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:34.590 
protein isolate so you get a blend of

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:36.500 
protein isolate so you get a blend of
different<00:05:34.980> proteins<00:05:35.400> so<00:05:35.760> you<00:05:35.820> get<00:05:36.060> a<00:05:36.090> steady

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:36.510 
different proteins so you get a steady

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:38.380 
different proteins so you get a steady
release<00:05:36.810> you<00:05:36.990> get<00:05:37.110> that<00:05:37.230> rapid<00:05:37.710> release<00:05:37.950> on

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:38.390 
release you get that rapid release on

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:41.750 
release you get that rapid release on
right<00:05:39.390> away<00:05:39.510> and<00:05:39.810> you<00:05:40.230> get<00:05:40.380> delayed<00:05:41.250> release

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:41.760 
right away and you get delayed release

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:43.670 
right away and you get delayed release
proteins<00:05:42.030> in<00:05:42.360> there<00:05:42.480> as<00:05:42.570> well<00:05:42.690> so<00:05:42.960> it's<00:05:43.440> a<00:05:43.500> good

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:43.680 
proteins in there as well so it's a good

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:46.010 
proteins in there as well so it's a good
one<00:05:43.860> that's<00:05:44.010> my<00:05:44.220> personal<00:05:44.610> favorite<00:05:45.030> they

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:46.020 
one that's my personal favorite they
