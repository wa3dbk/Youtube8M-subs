00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:09.269
 And then there 's the gatton crowd in the area. 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:10.920
 the x-rays were launched guys today 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:12.330
 March 10 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.240
 and everyone is getting to play 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:17.670
 Okay, just not in any way I 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:21.029
 I tested the idr the hardware or hardware to 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:23.160
 galera more than the long awaited hydra hunt 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:25.140
 this amazing hunting that brings us back to 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.510
 gta san andreas that when we did 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.849
 hunting codes that went up vertically 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:32.040
 and we used it to break everything down. 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:33.540
 to disturb public order and now 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.180
 is available for us to play at 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.610
 gta5 not only that rockstar too 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.950
 released for purchase in online mode but the 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.719
 Price of it's kinda heavy you're going to stay 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.090
 a little bit poorer if you buy 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:47.579
 he and he costs you the trifle of punk 3 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.770
 millions of dollars is the most expensive vehicle 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.000
 of the game but in my opinion is the most 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.469
 outside the west 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.600
 at first you some of the strange 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:56.219
 gameplay the way he flies 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.199
 and awkward but when you 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:00.059
 Do you realize that he asked me? 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.980
 nothing or anyone in the galley because he 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:04.439
 operates in vetol mode as you already know 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.240
 take flight vertically which does not 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:08.010
 need space to isolate more 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.619
 skill plus fuck him for sure 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:13.020
 We can make the fucking side you have. 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:15.570
 one direction and can take away from the 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.189
 holding the r button 191 this skill 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.619
 that I did not have in the gta san andreas 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:22.259
 that is the item of this generation is very 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:24.000
 more over power a tip guys if you 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:25.740
 still can not take the hydra but if 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.450
 But you want to test? 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.460
 You can pick it up in Creator mode. 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.590
 you place it on the ground you can give 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.540
 a return with him for a saint and play the 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.100
 where porter is available either 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.229
 say if the servers run on 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.119
 alert because even though the creator 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:41.390
 need the servers to be online 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:43.370
 I kind of anticipated this guys when 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:44.690
 it was released the amount of people 

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:46.760
 trying to play same time too 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:48.470
 made things difficult and people mouths 

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:50.450
 They managed to play but over time this 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:52.490
 stabilize the galera this was a video 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:54.170
 Hurry, I just threw the boxes in the house. 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:57.050
 of my friend I even asked and 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:58.550
 gameplay or it was worth and Marcao is we are 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:00.890

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:05.680
