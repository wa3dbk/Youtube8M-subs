of youth the sir you can just feel when
you<00:03:22.100> all<00:03:22.220> see<00:03:22.670> when<00:03:22.850> you're<00:03:22.970> accelerating<00:03:23.270> are

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:23.810 
you all see when you're accelerating are

you all see when you're accelerating are
the<00:03:24.220> the<00:03:25.220> gearbox<00:03:25.670> sort<00:03:25.880> of<00:03:25.940> moves<00:03:26.150> very

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:26.390 
the the gearbox sort of moves very

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:29.620 
the the gearbox sort of moves very
slightly<00:03:26.750> so<00:03:27.760> perhaps<00:03:28.760> a<00:03:28.970> new<00:03:29.090> set<00:03:29.270> of<00:03:29.360> engine

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:29.630 
slightly so perhaps a new set of engine

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:31.120 
slightly so perhaps a new set of engine
mounts<00:03:29.930> would<00:03:30.080> take<00:03:30.260> out<00:03:30.500> a<00:03:30.530> little<00:03:30.800> bit<00:03:30.980> of
