00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:11.879
 Yes everyone is my hobbies, it's here to introduce today 

00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:11.879
 It is a mug of Precure All Stars new stage 3 theater sale goods 

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:26.230
 I began to review the theater selling goods as if they were reminded recently Tsu is my imagination 

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:31.680
 There is nothing like the outside box in this way It is a white box 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:38.830
 It is written I mug cup on surface seems is also sold in the online shop 

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:42.190
 Â¥ 1,143 + tax that because of this had been surely also wrote me ze plus at the time of that ribbon 

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:44.270
 Will be 8% measures 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:46.090
 Let's open it 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:47.550
 Hmm 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:53.960
 The 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:53.960
 I opened it in the theater to check if it's been done once, but this also 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.870
 What a nice 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:06.600
 It feels like a little ordinary markup and something for little kids 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:09.690
 I also feel something thin here 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.890
 I do not that kind of touch Chatchii cans but 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:14.990
 The pattern is f 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:16.680
 It is like this 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:18.710
 I had 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.710
 Hmm 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:33.730
 Yes it would be useful to have a turntable at this time 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:39.160
 The feeling of this heart was introduced last time 

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:45.750
 It looks great with the feel of the reflector pass case, but it's great, but close by 

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:45.750
 This print is a bit rough when you look at it 

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:50.850
 Well I don't see it so close 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:54.540
 If it sees in the same district, it is beautiful 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:57.390
 And there is a logo for the 10th anniversary. 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:02:00.050
 Of myself quite like this cod stuff 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.270
 I use a mug but 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:06.939
 that 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:11.110
 It's peeled off, but if it's washed, let's try something with a kind of strong system 

00:02:06.939 --> 00:02:14.830
 There is a guy who will come off when it gets cold 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:19.540
 Maybe the feeling of konkon can be measured 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:20.110
 There was a feeling of this print, so it may be better not to wash too hard. 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:21.260
 It is not 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:25.849
 Or know only those of little in 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:27.620
 It may come off if you don't make a date out of the day you laugh and go outside 

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:32.180
 Hmm 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:34.980
 Yes this time is the theater sale of friends of the Pretty Cure All Stars new politics Suri a 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:39.840
 It was introduction of the toy mug 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:42.350
 It's made quite well, but the print is a little rough tower that pudding 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:47.750
 Which alla say 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:48.620
 It is to say I wish or not you peeled off is concerned about is cute your amazing Toka pattern 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:53.690
 The 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:59.050
 Well mark-up itself is quite solid, so even if you use it 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:59.050
 I don't think there's anything going to happen 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:07.530
 The heat resistance is a mug, so it's a kid. 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:11.670
 I think that it is okay Kedomo I had been what you wrote to okay Tsu Bo 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:13.940
 Also thank you next time Now Thank you for your viewing 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:13.940
 Well then 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:22.520

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:22.520
 ame
