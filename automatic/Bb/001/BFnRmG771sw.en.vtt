just some egg whites and I'm just going

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:44.270 
just some egg whites and I'm just going
to<00:04:41.700> just<00:04:42.630> brush<00:04:42.900> it<00:04:42.930> gently<00:04:43.320> onto<00:04:43.650> the<00:04:43.950> crust

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:44.280 
to just brush it gently onto the crust

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:46.310 
to just brush it gently onto the crust
and<00:04:44.580> this<00:04:44.940> is<00:04:45.090> going<00:04:45.270> to<00:04:45.360> act<00:04:45.510> as<00:04:45.690> just<00:04:45.930> a<00:04:46.020> glue

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:46.320 
and this is going to act as just a glue

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:49.310 
and this is going to act as just a glue
for<00:04:47.100> the<00:04:47.400> leaves<00:04:47.640> to<00:04:47.910> stick<00:04:48.120> on<00:04:48.330> to<00:04:48.600> and<00:04:49.020> I<00:04:49.200> was

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:49.320 
for the leaves to stick on to and I was

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:51.860 
for the leaves to stick on to and I was
going<00:04:49.560> to<00:04:49.680> randomly<00:04:50.400> and<00:04:50.730> alternatingly<00:04:51.510> like

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:51.870 
going to randomly and alternatingly like

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:55.130 
going to randomly and alternatingly like
kind<00:04:52.470> of<00:04:52.560> put<00:04:52.680> the<00:04:52.830> the<00:04:53.310> stem<00:04:54.270> at<00:04:54.450> the<00:04:54.630> outside

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:55.140 
kind of put the the stem at the outside

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:56.960 
kind of put the the stem at the outside
and<00:04:55.410> then<00:04:55.500> the<00:04:55.620> inside<00:04:55.650> and<00:04:56.610> I'm<00:04:56.730> going<00:04:56.790> to

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:56.970 
and then the inside and I'm going to

00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:58.600 
and then the inside and I'm going to
going<00:04:57.419> to<00:04:57.510> go<00:04:57.600> around<00:04:57.690> the<00:04:58.020> whole<00:04:58.230> entire

00:04:58.600 --> 00:04:58.610 
going to go around the whole entire

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:04.159 
going to go around the whole entire
crust<00:04:59.610> like<00:04:59.910> that<00:05:00.210> and<00:05:01.970> then<00:05:02.970> right<00:05:03.780> before<00:05:03.960> I

00:05:04.159 --> 00:05:04.169 
crust like that and then right before I

00:05:04.169 --> 00:05:09.140 
crust like that and then right before I
pour<00:05:04.560> in<00:05:04.830> the<00:05:06.410> the<00:05:07.410> ends<00:05:07.710> like<00:05:07.890> the<00:05:08.150> cheesecake

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:09.150 
pour in the the ends like the cheesecake

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:10.940 
pour in the the ends like the cheesecake
and<00:05:09.180> everything<00:05:09.690> what<00:05:10.230> I<00:05:10.260> need<00:05:10.590> to<00:05:10.710> do<00:05:10.830> is

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:10.950 
and everything what I need to do is

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:13.400 
and everything what I need to do is
brush<00:05:11.250> this<00:05:11.580> again<00:05:11.970> like<00:05:12.600> this<00:05:12.870> with<00:05:13.140> the<00:05:13.290> egg

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:13.410 
brush this again like this with the egg

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:15.890 
brush this again like this with the egg
white<00:05:13.650> and<00:05:13.770> that's<00:05:13.950> going<00:05:14.190> to<00:05:14.250> help<00:05:14.460> the<00:05:15.120> crust

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:15.900 
white and that's going to help the crust

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:17.780 
white and that's going to help the crust
Brown<00:05:16.230> so<00:05:16.860> I'm<00:05:16.919> going<00:05:17.070> to<00:05:17.130> finish<00:05:17.340> off<00:05:17.640> the

it's even here this is going to take up
most<00:05:43.020> of<00:05:43.199> the<00:05:43.349> bottom<00:05:43.649> of<00:05:43.770> the<00:05:43.889> pie<00:05:45.229> and<00:05:46.819> then

00:05:47.889 --> 00:05:47.899 
most of the bottom of the pie and then

00:05:47.899 --> 00:05:51.799 
most of the bottom of the pie and then
just<00:05:48.899> pouring<00:05:49.259> it<00:05:49.379> on<00:05:49.529> top<00:05:49.949> is<00:05:50.360> the<00:05:51.360> pumpkin

just pouring it on top is the pumpkin

00:05:51.809 --> 00:05:54.200 
just pouring it on top is the pumpkin
layer<00:05:52.139> next<00:05:52.580> so<00:05:53.580> you<00:05:53.639> want<00:05:53.789> to<00:05:53.879> pour<00:05:54.059> this

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:54.210 
layer next so you want to pour this

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:55.730 
layer next so you want to pour this
slowly<00:05:54.539> to<00:05:54.899> make<00:05:55.050> sure<00:05:55.199> that<00:05:55.379> you<00:05:55.499> don't<00:05:55.649> get

00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:55.740 
slowly to make sure that you don't get

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:59.389 
slowly to make sure that you don't get
too<00:05:56.159> much<00:05:56.460> in<00:05:56.789> your<00:05:56.909> pie<00:05:57.119> and<00:05:57.949> it<00:05:58.949> doesn't<00:05:59.219> come

00:05:59.389 --> 00:05:59.399 
too much in your pie and it doesn't come

00:05:59.399 --> 00:06:03.469 
too much in your pie and it doesn't come
up<00:05:59.550> above<00:05:59.849> your<00:06:00.119> leaves<00:06:01.849> so<00:06:02.849> that's<00:06:03.119> about

00:06:03.469 --> 00:06:03.479 
up above your leaves so that's about

00:06:03.479 --> 00:06:06.139 
up above your leaves so that's about
good<00:06:03.749> so<00:06:04.680> now<00:06:04.860> what<00:06:05.099> I'm<00:06:05.189> going<00:06:05.219> to<00:06:05.459> do<00:06:05.669> is<00:06:05.909> put

00:06:06.139 --> 00:06:06.149 
good so now what I'm going to do is put

00:06:06.149 --> 00:06:10.939 
good so now what I'm going to do is put
it<00:06:06.300> into<00:06:06.719> the<00:06:07.020> oven<00:06:07.529> at<00:06:07.919> 375<00:06:08.819> degrees<00:06:09.949> and

00:06:10.939 --> 00:06:10.949 
it into the oven at 375 degrees and

00:06:10.949 --> 00:06:13.279 
it into the oven at 375 degrees and
that's<00:06:11.129> gonna<00:06:11.309> bake<00:06:11.610> for<00:06:12.180> about<00:06:12.330> 60<00:06:12.959> to<00:06:13.259> 70

00:06:13.279 --> 00:06:13.289 
that's gonna bake for about 60 to 70

00:06:13.289 --> 00:06:16.119 
that's gonna bake for about 60 to 70
minutes<00:06:14.219> until<00:06:14.879> the<00:06:14.999> edge<00:06:15.149> is<00:06:15.509> golden<00:06:15.990> brown

00:06:16.119 --> 00:06:16.129 
minutes until the edge is golden brown

00:06:16.129 --> 00:06:19.100 
minutes until the edge is golden brown
so<00:06:17.129> the<00:06:17.279> pie<00:06:17.459> has<00:06:17.729> cooled<00:06:18.089> completely<00:06:18.869> and

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:19.110 
so the pie has cooled completely and

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:21.469 
so the pie has cooled completely and

00:06:21.469 --> 00:06:21.479 
what I did to get the leaves in the top

00:06:21.479 --> 00:06:23.600 
what I did to get the leaves in the top
was<00:06:21.659> I<00:06:21.779> just<00:06:21.959> cut<00:06:22.199> a<00:06:22.229> couple<00:06:22.469> extras<00:06:23.069> and<00:06:23.219> in
