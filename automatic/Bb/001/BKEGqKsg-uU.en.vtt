i was actually enjoying the movie to be

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:54.379 
i was actually enjoying the movie to be
honest<00:04:51.419> um<00:04:52.400> like<00:04:53.400> I<00:04:53.490> said<00:04:53.520> my<00:04:53.789> favorite<00:04:54.150> movie

00:04:54.379 --> 00:04:54.389 
honest um like I said my favorite movie

00:04:54.389 --> 00:04:56.900 
honest um like I said my favorite movie
of<00:04:54.419> the<00:04:54.600> series<00:04:54.990> is<00:04:55.229> number<00:04:55.530> three<00:04:55.830> I<00:04:56.100> think<00:04:56.820> it

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:56.910 
of the series is number three I think it

00:04:56.910 --> 00:05:00.260 
of the series is number three I think it
goes<00:04:57.000> number<00:04:57.410> 31<00:04:58.580> number<00:04:59.580> four<00:04:59.820> and<00:05:00.150> the

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:00.270 
goes number 31 number four and the

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:02.090 
goes number 31 number four and the
number<00:05:00.510> two<00:05:00.690> being<00:05:00.930> the<00:05:01.050> weakest<00:05:01.320> one<00:05:01.500> in<00:05:01.710> the

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:02.100 
number two being the weakest one in the

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:04.010 
number two being the weakest one in the
bunch<00:05:02.250> i<00:05:02.490> think<00:05:02.700> the<00:05:02.850> number<00:05:02.880> to<00:05:03.240> kind<00:05:03.870> of

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:04.020 
bunch i think the number to kind of

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:06.440 
bunch i think the number to kind of
through<00:05:04.229> is<00:05:04.440> kind<00:05:04.710> of<00:05:04.860> made<00:05:05.789> me<00:05:05.820> not<00:05:06.060> like<00:05:06.120> it

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:06.450 
through is kind of made me not like it

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:08.000 
through is kind of made me not like it
as<00:05:06.539> much<00:05:06.570> because<00:05:06.960> of<00:05:07.410> the<00:05:07.530> whole<00:05:07.650> thing<00:05:07.889> with

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:08.010 
as much because of the whole thing with

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:09.710 
as much because of the whole thing with
the<00:05:08.070> pool<00:05:08.280> maybe<00:05:08.850> they<00:05:09.090> show<00:05:09.270> too<00:05:09.330> much<00:05:09.450> of<00:05:09.660> a

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:09.720 
the pool maybe they show too much of a

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:11.570 
the pool maybe they show too much of a
pool<00:05:09.960> and<00:05:10.200> the<00:05:10.590> payoff<00:05:10.770> of<00:05:10.919> that<00:05:11.250> thing<00:05:11.430> was

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:11.580 
pool and the payoff of that thing was

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:14.570 
pool and the payoff of that thing was
that<00:05:11.729> wasn't<00:05:11.970> very<00:05:12.030> good<00:05:12.210> but<00:05:12.630> uh<00:05:13.350> all<00:05:14.190> in<00:05:14.430> all
