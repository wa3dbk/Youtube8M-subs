00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.100
 this is hhc to find 

00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:05.330
 made possible by car 

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:06.920
 drugs 

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:09.800
 wish a card 

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:13.960
 and studio and 28 corporate films 

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:13.960
 commercials and animations 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:28.420
 are the club in orange and black 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.329
 h7 with it 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:35.460
 I've had to think about this all week 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:37.170
 the song of bruce springsteen working 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.450
 on a dream 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:42.629
 because that is what HC is doing 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:44.129
 is working on a dream 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:46.500
 this is a green screen and that did n't happen 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:48.379
 because our camera is broken but that is because 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.580
 by the supporters of scheveningen who 

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:51.809
 take green smoke 

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:53.970
 instead of white smoke is once again 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:56.100
 something else 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:59.280
 and so the game starts between hc 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:02.100
 hardenberg and scheveningen 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:04.229
 a competition that is important to it 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.600
 championship walter hc of course still 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:09.180
 always the title candidate 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.490
 first chance in the match after one 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.520
 doubtful start is from heelke 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.520
 penterman 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.100
 he is just lacking 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:28.380
 sargon gouriye last week so good 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:30.869
 is going to lay here and the referee 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:34.320
 see that you can't ignore that either 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:38.150
 of course and put the ball on the dot 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.150
 referee huisa from leeuwarden 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.450
 justified penalty courier becomes the 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:44.670
 tapped the yellow card is still there 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.990
 and therefore a penalty for hc and that is 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.880
 a great way to take the lead 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:51.119
 and that also happens via heelke 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:53.990
 penterman the man is ideally suited 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.990
 for penalties 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.159
 and so hc on rose 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.670
 anal 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:10.330
 of course important what gvvv in 

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:14.170
 spakenburg at ijsselmeervogels and 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:15.550
 here in the event of a disaster and a do 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:18.030
 and there he is new again 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:18.030
 penterman 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:24.040
 and that is a special goal this 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:26.700
 this is his 49th goal in the 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:26.700
 top class 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:34.270
 and katwijker donny van oijen has at 49 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:35.920
 goals and so are the man and 

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:37.989
 van ooijen therefore at the top of the 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:41.170
 top scorers list 

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:42.700
 from the top class really with everything 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:45.400
 is tracked of course but this is 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:47.430
 so a memorable goal for heelke 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:47.430
 penterman 

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:55.330
 here the possibility for scheveningen 

00:02:55.770 --> 00:03:03.990
 they remained dangerous and do not go for it 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:06.710
 but what of course were stunned 

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:06.710
 due to that early backlog 

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:13.590
 buri je he is dangerous from the 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:15.360
 shelves and then it shows again and again 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:17.010
 as a penthum if a third makes one 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:19.680
 pure hat trick 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:23.010
 exactly 26 minutes and 49 seconds 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:25.190
 So he makes a fiftieth goal in the 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:25.190
 top class 

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:30.750
 what a beautiful anniversary 

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:33.240
 and that with a pure hat trick guys 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:35.160
 boys boys when this goes 

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:37.500
 slowly but surely you have the idea 

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:41.910
 everyone has the idea on the forest corner 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:44.130
 that the camp are actually going to happen 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:45.870
 did not dare with a few weeks ago 

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:47.130
 to pronounce 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:50.310
 we dare not even dream of 

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:52.940
 but now we are working on that dream 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:52.940
 working on a dream 

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:58.380
 good option for this 

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:59.550
 Scheveningen for an own goal 

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:02.540
 groningen will not be there of course 

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:02.540
 happy from the side 

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:12.900
 scheveningen will try again 

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:17.130
 yes what can you do if your 308 says this 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:18.630
 are dangerous balls why if it 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:21.810
 he had succeeded you had on the world 

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:24.360
 gone but he fails 

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:27.060
 and so he does not travel the world 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:29.310
 as simple as it is without the second half than 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:32.610
 points man on his way to his fourth 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:34.139
 yes, because again the ball hits the dot 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:37.440
 second penalty that referee 

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:39.479
 huisa today gives after one 

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:42.620
 violation of valley dion being there too 

00:04:39.479 --> 00:04:42.620
 for the yellow card 

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:47.640
 points man on the way to the goal 

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:51.030
 slightly tapped 

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:54.600
 likes to go to the ground and 

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:57.350
 so it can celebrate or become and won f40 

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:57.350
 thousand number 51 

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:00.920
 it's his afternoon 

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:06.050
 4 goals for heel penterman 

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:20.570
 n40 who would have thought that where is going 

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:20.570
 this end 

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:27.129
 and it is extremely exciting immediately 

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:27.129
 to resolve 

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:36.040
 scheveningen it keeps trying but ac 

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:41.920
 can open through gouriye 

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:44.290
 get here quickly and be smart and be here 

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:49.240
 grandiose undermined by samir el 

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:51.390
 mass of oil and I think this will turn red 

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:51.390
 Yes 

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:58.240
 rightly broke through 

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:59.800
 stupid action you know the match 

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:01.210
 is lost and you now know as well 

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:05.290
 that you do not understand the following law but 

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:07.800
 gonna be the man who says hey this 

00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:07.800
 is a handball 

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:15.240
 in the referee's first huizinga 

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:15.240
 from then on we will put the dot again 

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:25.420
 it seems as if 4 mobile appeals 

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:26.860
 but in repetition we are going to see it 

00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:28.960
 is actually border it 

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:30.880
 So rightly what he does and door lock is right 

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:35.470
 penterman may make his fifth 

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:38.410
 hurry and so wins HC with four zero stays 

00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:40.780
 participating for the title and boys 

00:06:38.410 --> 00:06:42.880
 guys where is this gonna end 

00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:45.880
 the competition of the year in 2 weeks 

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:47.560
 in spakenburg against the blue and what 

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:49.490
 we want to beat those graves 

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:51.610
 HC is still taking part in it 

00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:51.610
 championship 

00:06:54.530 --> 00:07:00.650
 member history of haasje hardenberg 

00:06:57.110 --> 00:07:04.759
 again with the hhc hardenberg graham we 

00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:06.960
 Now, at its very handwerk.nl 

00:07:04.759 --> 00:07:09.790
 this is hhc to drink 

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:13.690
 made possible by car 

00:07:09.790 --> 00:07:18.540
 vans a cart and studio and 28 

00:07:13.690 --> 00:07:18.540
