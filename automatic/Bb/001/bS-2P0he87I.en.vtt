00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:30.109 
of them the lower and the upper because

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:32.860 
of them the lower and the upper because
it's<00:00:30.289> plastic<00:00:30.859> and<00:00:31.130> all<00:00:31.640> that<00:00:31.789> stuff<00:00:32.060> it<00:00:32.600> gets

it's plastic and all that stuff it gets

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:34.390 
it's plastic and all that stuff it gets
in<00:00:33.080> there<00:00:33.230> and<00:00:33.410> as<00:00:33.500> you<00:00:33.680> can<00:00:33.830> see<00:00:34.010> we<00:00:34.130> have<00:00:34.250> to

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:34.400 
in there and as you can see we have to

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:37.870 
in there and as you can see we have to
break<00:00:34.730> that<00:00:35.030> bolt<00:00:36.370> around<00:00:37.370> it<00:00:37.580> because

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:37.880 
break that bolt around it because

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:39.970 
break that bolt around it because
they're<00:00:38.300> so<00:00:38.480> small<00:00:38.540> the<00:00:39.110> bolts<00:00:39.410> are<00:00:39.530> so<00:00:39.710> small

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:39.980 
they're so small the bolts are so small

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:42.520 
they're so small the bolts are so small
that<00:00:40.250> they'll<00:00:40.970> strip<00:00:41.360> there's<00:00:41.750> five<00:00:42.050> sixteen

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:42.530 
that they'll strip there's five sixteen

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:45.540 
that they'll strip there's five sixteen
or<00:00:42.740> eight<00:00:42.860> millimeters<00:00:43.430> and<00:00:44.240> they<00:00:44.420> break<00:00:44.780> and

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:45.550 
or eight millimeters and they break and

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:48.640 
or eight millimeters and they break and
I<00:00:46.550> wanted<00:00:47.300> to<00:00:47.360> show<00:00:47.630> everybody<00:00:48.410> a<00:00:48.530> little

trick to if you don't have the little
tension<00:00:53.390> or<00:00:53.720> a<00:00:53.750> tool<00:00:54.050> the<00:00:54.290> specialty<00:00:54.830> tool<00:00:55.040> for

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:55.280 
tension or a tool the specialty tool for

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:57.760 
tension or a tool the specialty tool for
the<00:00:55.370> tensioner<00:00:55.850> you<00:00:56.060> see<00:00:56.210> down<00:00:56.390> there<00:00:56.770> you

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:57.770 
the tensioner you see down there you

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:00.430 
the tensioner you see down there you
don't<00:00:57.890> have<00:00:58.190> to<00:00:58.310> worry<00:00:58.520> about<00:00:58.610> that<00:00:59.410> go<00:01:00.410> ahead

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:00.440 
don't have to worry about that go ahead

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:03.160 
don't have to worry about that go ahead

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:03.170 
a focus on that on let me turn it around

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:06.070 
a focus on that on let me turn it around
so<00:01:03.530> that<00:01:03.650> you<00:01:04.550> guys<00:01:04.760> don't<00:01:05.000> end<00:01:05.630> up<00:01:05.780> getting

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:14.120 
grab your your hat your 3/8 drive

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:17.470 
grab your your hat your 3/8 drive
ratchet<00:01:14.680> and<00:01:15.680> what<00:01:15.830> I<00:01:15.860> do<00:01:15.980> is<00:01:16.280> I'll<00:01:16.430> get<00:01:16.640> I'll

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:17.480 
ratchet and what I do is I'll get I'll

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:19.630 
ratchet and what I do is I'll get I'll
get<00:01:17.780> an<00:01:17.870> extension<00:01:18.260> a<00:01:18.530> six<00:01:18.740> inches<00:01:19.100> tension

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:19.640 
get an extension a six inches tension

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:23.380 
get an extension a six inches tension
with<00:01:20.570> a<00:01:20.620> 3/4<00:01:21.650> it's<00:01:22.130> probably<00:01:22.460> an<00:01:22.580> 18<00:01:22.940> milli

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:23.390 
with a 3/4 it's probably an 18 milli

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:25.210 
with a 3/4 it's probably an 18 milli
or<00:01:23.600> something<00:01:24.290> that<00:01:24.410> goes<00:01:24.560> over<00:01:24.920> it<00:01:25.040> and

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:25.220 
or something that goes over it and

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:27.400 
or something that goes over it and
that's<00:01:25.430> deep<00:01:25.730> so<00:01:26.420> what<00:01:26.660> we're<00:01:26.840> gonna<00:01:27.020> do<00:01:27.230> is

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:27.410 
that's deep so what we're gonna do is

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:29.500 
that's deep so what we're gonna do is
we're<00:01:27.560> fabricating<00:01:28.220> a<00:01:28.310> tool<00:01:28.520> with<00:01:29.120> leverage

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:29.510 
we're fabricating a tool with leverage

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:31.300 
we're fabricating a tool with leverage
because<00:01:29.720> if<00:01:29.990> you<00:01:30.170> only<00:01:30.350> have<00:01:30.650> this<00:01:30.890> it's<00:01:31.159> not

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:31.310 
because if you only have this it's not

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:32.770 
because if you only have this it's not
long<00:01:31.610> enough<00:01:31.880> for<00:01:32.150> you<00:01:32.270> to<00:01:32.300> have<00:01:32.540> enough

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:32.780 
long enough for you to have enough

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:36.640 
long enough for you to have enough
torque<00:01:33.140> to<00:01:33.950> undo<00:01:34.700> the<00:01:34.850> belt<00:01:35.030> so<00:01:35.780> you<00:01:35.840> just<00:01:36.140> go

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:36.650 
torque to undo the belt so you just go

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:44.260 
torque to undo the belt so you just go
down<00:01:36.860> there<00:01:37.100> and<00:01:37.250> install<00:01:37.610> your<00:01:37.880> 3/8<00:01:43.270> make

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:44.270 
down there and install your 3/8 make

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:47.290 
down there and install your 3/8 make
sure<00:01:44.510> it<00:01:44.570> doesn't<00:01:44.900> fall<00:01:45.110> down<00:01:45.580> ok<00:01:46.580> so<00:01:46.640> once<00:01:47.150> you

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:47.300 
sure it doesn't fall down ok so once you

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:48.730 
sure it doesn't fall down ok so once you
have<00:01:47.479> it<00:01:47.630> you're<00:01:47.750> grabbing<00:01:47.990> it<00:01:48.229> like<00:01:48.380> that<00:01:48.590> you

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:48.740 
have it you're grabbing it like that you

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:52.450 
have it you're grabbing it like that you
slide<00:01:49.070> this<00:01:49.280> on<00:01:49.520> it<00:01:50.290> and<00:01:51.290> make<00:01:51.860> you<00:01:52.130> see<00:01:52.310> how

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:52.460 
slide this on it and make you see how

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:59.110 
slide this on it and make you see how
easy<00:01:52.670> it<00:01:52.850> is<00:01:53.979> get<00:01:54.979> it<00:01:55.010> out<00:01:55.280> of<00:01:55.310> it<00:01:57.220> BAM<00:01:58.220> that<00:01:58.970> was

00:01:59.110 --> 00:01:59.120 
easy it is get it out of it BAM that was

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.530 
easy it is get it out of it BAM that was
easy

00:01:59.530 --> 00:01:59.540 
easy

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:01.539 
easy
that's<00:01:59.870> easy<00:02:00.080> you<00:02:00.260> don't<00:02:00.530> have<00:02:00.650> to<00:02:00.799> so<00:02:01.520> that

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:01.549 
that's easy you don't have to so that

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:07.930 
that's easy you don't have to so that
you<00:02:01.820> don't<00:02:01.970> have<00:02:02.090> to<00:02:02.240> go<00:02:02.960> crazy<00:02:03.170> time<00:02:03.770> to<00:02:06.940> bring

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:07.940 
you don't have to go crazy time to bring

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:10.890 
you don't have to go crazy time to bring
it<00:02:08.090> up<00:02:08.209> and<00:02:08.479> you<00:02:08.539> do<00:02:08.690> the<00:02:08.780> same<00:02:08.959> procedure

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:10.900 
it up and you do the same procedure

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:16.410 
it up and you do the same procedure
Dizzy's<00:02:11.900> torque<00:02:12.530> he<00:02:13.430> is<00:02:13.520> torque<00:02:14.320> okay<00:02:15.400> now
