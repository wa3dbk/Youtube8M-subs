00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:13.310 
they both have poor defenses so we're

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:14.890 
they both have poor defenses so we're
going<00:01:13.400> to<00:01:13.490> look<00:01:13.640> at<00:01:13.760> the<00:01:13.880> total<00:01:14.299> in<00:01:14.450> this<00:01:14.630> game

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:14.900 
going to look at the total in this game

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:17.350 
going to look at the total in this game
because<00:01:15.409> I<00:01:15.590> think<00:01:15.760> because<00:01:16.760> of<00:01:16.790> the<00:01:17.090> poor

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:17.360 
because I think because of the poor

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:19.539 
because I think because of the poor
defenses<00:01:18.080> and<00:01:18.290> their<00:01:18.710> ability<00:01:18.890> to<00:01:19.130> score

00:01:19.539 --> 00:01:19.549

Christian Ponder now in his third week

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:23.950 
Christian Ponder now in his third week
back<00:01:22.190> with<00:01:22.430> the<00:01:22.549> team<00:01:22.820> I<00:01:23.090> think<00:01:23.600> he's<00:01:23.780> getting

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:23.960 
back with the team I think he's getting

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:26.289 
back with the team I think he's getting
some<00:01:24.229> repetition<00:01:24.890> under<00:01:25.159> his<00:01:25.280> belt<00:01:25.580> he<00:01:26.060> showed

00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:26.299 
some repetition under his belt he showed

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:28.030 
some repetition under his belt he showed
that<00:01:26.330> he<00:01:26.510> can<00:01:26.720> score<00:01:27.049> against<00:01:27.440> Dallas<00:01:27.860> he

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:28.040 
that he can score against Dallas he

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:29.080 
that he can score against Dallas he
ought<00:01:28.159> to<00:01:28.190> be<00:01:28.340> able<00:01:28.430> to<00:01:28.580> score<00:01:28.820> against

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:29.090 
ought to be able to score against

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:30.789 
ought to be able to score against
Washington<00:01:29.780> and<00:01:29.960> I<00:01:30.080> think<00:01:30.290> the<00:01:30.409> same<00:01:30.590> is<00:01:30.619> true

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:30.799 
Washington and I think the same is true

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:32.410 
Washington and I think the same is true
where<00:01:31.130> the<00:01:31.220> Redskins<00:01:31.700> who<00:01:31.880> have<00:01:32.000> scored<00:01:32.330> all

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:32.420 
where the Redskins who have scored all

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:34.090 
where the Redskins who have scored all
year<00:01:32.659> long<00:01:32.900> are<00:01:33.409> going<00:01:33.560> to<00:01:33.619> be<00:01:33.710> able<00:01:33.799> to<00:01:33.950> pick

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:34.100 
year long are going to be able to pick

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:35.950 
year long are going to be able to pick

in<00:01:47.420> perspective<00:01:47.630> the<00:01:48.080> NFL<00:01:48.380> averages<00:01:48.799> 87<00:01:49.490> both

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:50.030 
in perspective the NFL averages 87 both

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:52.570 
in perspective the NFL averages 87 both
of<00:01:50.240> them<00:01:50.360> a<00:01:50.509> full<00:01:51.080> 10<00:01:51.380> points<00:01:51.740> below<00:01:52.340> average

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:52.580 
of them a full 10 points below average

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:56.440 
of them a full 10 points below average
so<00:01:53.299> we<00:01:53.900> would<00:01:54.080> expect<00:01:54.110> then<00:01:55.009> both<00:01:55.400> a<00:01:55.909> surging

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:56.450 
so we would expect then both a surging

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:59.469 
so we would expect then both a surging
rg3<00:01:57.079> and<00:01:57.290> a<00:01:57.950> surprisingly<00:01:58.759> good<00:01:58.880> Christian

00:01:59.469 --> 00:01:59.479 
rg3 and a surprisingly good Christian

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:01.840 
rg3 and a surprisingly good Christian

00:02:12.309 --> 00:02:12.319 
but we haven't seen that this year seems

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:13.940 
but we haven't seen that this year seems
like<00:02:12.530> NFL<00:02:12.920> teams<00:02:13.160> have<00:02:13.400> been<00:02:13.489> more

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
like NFL teams have been more

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.640 
like NFL teams have been more

short week right and typically the

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
a on a prime-time game and I see you

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.240 
a on a prime-time game and I see you
know<00:02:24.569> taking<00:02:24.900> the<00:02:25.170> other<00:02:25.260> side<00:02:25.590> going<00:02:25.920> under

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
know taking the other side going under

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.009 
know taking the other side going under
that<00:02:26.430> but<00:02:26.640> I'm<00:02:26.730> not<00:02:26.910> seeing<00:02:27.209> that<00:02:27.510> this<00:02:27.750> week

00:02:28.009 --> 00:02:28.019 
that but I'm not seeing that this week

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:30.259 
that but I'm not seeing that this week
again<00:02:28.769> I<00:02:28.800> think<00:02:29.280> it<00:02:29.400> just<00:02:29.550> sets<00:02:29.849> up<00:02:30.030> you've<00:02:30.239> got

00:02:30.259 --> 00:02:30.269 
again I think it just sets up you've got

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:32.960 
again I think it just sets up you've got
Washington<00:02:31.170> who<00:02:31.680> gains<00:02:32.099> five<00:02:32.489> point<00:02:32.880> nine

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
Washington who gains five point nine

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:35.240 
Washington who gains five point nine
yards<00:02:33.540> per<00:02:33.750> play<00:02:33.900> and<00:02:34.260> on<00:02:34.349> defense<00:02:34.830> they<00:02:35.010> give

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
yards per play and on defense they give

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:38.300 
yards per play and on defense they give
up<00:02:35.400> 6.1<00:02:36.330> on<00:02:36.569> the<00:02:36.989> other<00:02:37.140> side<00:02:37.440> Minnesota<00:02:38.069> on

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
up 6.1 on the other side Minnesota on

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.220 
up 6.1 on the other side Minnesota on
defense<00:02:38.880> can't<00:02:39.239> get<00:02:39.420> out<00:02:39.540> on<00:02:39.720> third<00:02:39.989> down

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
defense can't get out on third down

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:42.890 
defense can't get out on third down
almost<00:02:40.440> fifty<00:02:40.890> percent<00:02:41.190> of<00:02:41.340> the<00:02:41.400> time<00:02:41.640> so<00:02:42.299> you

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
almost fifty percent of the time so you

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:44.869 
almost fifty percent of the time so you
take<00:02:43.170> that<00:02:43.379> into<00:02:43.769> account<00:02:43.799> along<00:02:44.519> with<00:02:44.549> the

00:02:44.869 --> 00:02:44.879 
take that into account along with the

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:46.580 
take that into account along with the
fact<00:02:45.090> that<00:02:45.269> these<00:02:45.510> teams<00:02:45.900> are<00:02:46.110> going<00:02:46.290> to

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
fact that these teams are going to

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:48.740 
fact that these teams are going to
probably<00:02:46.950> go<00:02:47.400> into<00:02:47.640> the<00:02:47.730> game<00:02:47.940> plan<00:02:48.239> this<00:02:48.480> week

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
probably go into the game plan this week

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:50.690 
probably go into the game plan this week
knowing<00:02:49.319> that<00:02:49.500> they<00:02:49.620> each<00:02:49.799> have<00:02:50.069> poor<00:02:50.370> pass

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
knowing that they each have poor pass

knowing that they each have poor pass
defenses<00:02:51.450> saying<00:02:51.720> okay<00:02:51.989> we<00:02:52.140> need<00:02:52.290> to<00:02:52.410> throw

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
defenses saying okay we need to throw

the<00:02:52.860> ball<00:02:53.069> because<00:02:53.489> these<00:02:53.790> teams<00:02:54.090> defenses

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
the ball because these teams defenses

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:56.270 
the ball because these teams defenses
are<00:02:54.870> better<00:02:55.140> against<00:02:55.560> the<00:02:55.650> run<00:02:55.860> than<00:02:56.040> they<00:02:56.160> are

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
are better against the run than they are

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.309 
are better against the run than they are
the<00:02:56.430> pass<00:02:56.670> and<00:02:57.000> we<00:02:57.090> know<00:02:57.630> when<00:02:57.780> you<00:02:57.900> pass<00:02:58.110> the

00:02:58.309 --> 00:02:58.319 
the pass and we know when you pass the

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:00.229 
the pass and we know when you pass the
ball<00:02:58.470> it<00:02:58.590> slows<00:02:58.920> down<00:02:59.130> a<00:02:59.190> game<00:02:59.489> giving<00:02:59.940> us<00:03:00.060> more

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:00.239 
ball it slows down a game giving us more

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:03.170

00:03:41.059 --> 00:03:41.069 
believe five and three I don't think

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:43.580 
believe five and three I don't think
they've<00:03:41.190> had<00:03:41.400> their<00:03:41.579> by<00:03:41.760> at<00:03:42.000> five<00:03:42.180> and<00:03:42.389> four<00:03:42.660> so

00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:16.280 
the total in this pic the number is 48

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:18.249 
the total in this pic the number is 48
and<00:04:16.430> a<00:04:16.459> half<00:04:16.639> in<00:04:16.910> some<00:04:17.180> spots<00:04:17.479> and<00:04:17.870> I<00:04:18.049> would

00:04:18.249 --> 00:04:18.259 
and a half in some spots and I would

00:04:18.259 --> 00:04:20.080 
and a half in some spots and I would
suggest<00:04:18.500> getting<00:04:18.889> it<00:04:19.160> now<00:04:19.310> because<00:04:19.759> it<00:04:19.910> has

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:20.090 
suggest getting it now because it has

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:22.240

both<00:04:25.729> have<00:04:25.970> weak<00:04:26.270> defenses<00:04:27.020> and<00:04:27.229> the

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:25.550 
on the road on Thursday everything seems

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:27.820 
on the road on Thursday everything seems
to<00:05:25.729> point<00:05:25.940> towards<00:05:26.270> the<00:05:26.479> over<00:05:26.900> and<00:05:27.080> most<00:05:27.650> of

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:27.830 
to point towards the over and most of

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:29.409 
to point towards the over and most of
all<00:05:28.010> I<00:05:28.280> think<00:05:28.550> these<00:05:28.849> teams<00:05:29.150> are<00:05:29.240> going<00:05:29.360> to

00:05:29.409 --> 00:05:29.419 
all I think these teams are going to

00:05:29.419 --> 00:05:31.149 
all I think these teams are going to
want<00:05:29.630> to<00:05:29.690> throw<00:05:30.020> the<00:05:30.229> ball<00:05:30.409> because<00:05:30.650> they<00:05:30.949> know

00:05:31.149 --> 00:05:31.159 
want to throw the ball because they know

00:05:31.159 --> 00:05:33.219 
want to throw the ball because they know
the<00:05:31.340> weakness<00:05:31.820> of<00:05:32.000> the<00:05:32.120> other<00:05:32.300> teams<00:05:32.690> defense

00:05:33.219 --> 00:05:33.229 
the weakness of the other teams defense

00:05:33.229 --> 00:05:35.860 
the weakness of the other teams defense
is<00:05:33.440> against<00:05:34.280> the<00:05:34.400> pass<00:05:34.610> and<00:05:34.970> if<00:05:35.449> it's<00:05:35.630> not<00:05:35.720> a

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:35.870 
is against the pass and if it's not a

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:37.300 
is against the pass and if it's not a
game<00:05:36.259> where<00:05:36.500> they're<00:05:36.650> running<00:05:37.009> the<00:05:37.130> ball

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:37.310 
game where they're running the ball

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:40.060 
game where they're running the ball
constantly<00:05:37.880> the<00:05:38.630> clock<00:05:38.960> is<00:05:39.229> going<00:05:39.409> to<00:05:39.710> slow

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:40.070 
constantly the clock is going to slow

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:42.100 
constantly the clock is going to slow
down<00:05:40.280> with<00:05:40.550> them<00:05:40.699> passing<00:05:41.180> the<00:05:41.300> ball<00:05:41.479> there's

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:42.110 
down with them passing the ball there's

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:43.570 
down with them passing the ball there's
going<00:05:42.380> to<00:05:42.470> be<00:05:42.500> a<00:05:42.590> lot<00:05:42.800> of<00:05:42.830> opportunity<00:05:43.550> for

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:43.580 
going to be a lot of opportunity for

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:46.629 
going to be a lot of opportunity for
points<00:05:44.180> the<00:05:44.570> numbers<00:05:44.930> 48<00:05:45.500> and<00:05:45.680> a<00:05:45.710> half<00:05:45.919> last
