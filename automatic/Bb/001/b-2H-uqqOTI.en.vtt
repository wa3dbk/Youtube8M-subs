understand come on walk stop it I think
they'd<00:04:07.970> actually<00:04:08.090> sell<00:04:08.510> a<00:04:08.540> lot<00:04:08.810> more<00:04:08.840> of<00:04:09.229> these

00:04:09.339 --> 00:04:09.349 
they'd actually sell a lot more of these

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:13.629 
they'd actually sell a lot more of these
if<00:04:09.739> they<00:04:10.519> allowed<00:04:10.840> the<00:04:11.840> zero<00:04:12.139> overlap<00:04:12.530> just<00:04:13.400> by

00:04:13.629 --> 00:04:13.639 
if they allowed the zero overlap just by

00:04:13.639 --> 00:04:15.339 
if they allowed the zero overlap just by
replacing<00:04:13.940> the<00:04:14.389> screws<00:04:14.629> that's<00:04:14.959> all<00:04:15.199> they've

00:04:15.339 --> 00:04:15.349 
replacing the screws that's all they've

00:04:15.349 --> 00:04:17.589 
replacing the screws that's all they've
got<00:04:15.530> to<00:04:15.560> do<00:04:15.799> but<00:04:16.519> if<00:04:16.760> you<00:04:16.880> check<00:04:17.060> these<00:04:17.239> screws

00:04:17.589 --> 00:04:17.599 
got to do but if you check these screws

00:04:17.599 --> 00:04:22.170 
got to do but if you check these screws
on<00:04:18.909> basically<00:04:19.909> this<00:04:20.630> one<00:04:20.870> has<00:04:21.049> like<00:04:21.229> a<00:04:21.289> little

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:22.180 
on basically this one has like a little

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:24.350 
on basically this one has like a little
lip

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:24.360 
lip

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:27.240 
lip
right<00:04:25.360> there<00:04:25.690> to<00:04:26.470> stop<00:04:26.530> you<00:04:26.800> from<00:04:26.920> adjusting

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:27.250 
right there to stop you from adjusting

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:29.610 
right there to stop you from adjusting
the<00:04:27.580> blade<00:04:27.810> we<00:04:28.810> don't<00:04:29.020> want<00:04:29.200> that<00:04:29.350> I<00:04:29.590> don't

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:29.620 
the blade we don't want that I don't

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:33.000 
the blade we don't want that I don't
like<00:04:30.010> that<00:04:30.250> I've<00:04:30.850> gone<00:04:31.090> into<00:04:31.360> business<00:04:32.010> but

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:33.010 
like that I've gone into business but

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:36.950 
like that I've gone into business but
the<00:04:33.190> normal<00:04:33.550> screws<00:04:33.940> they<00:04:34.540> don't<00:04:35.550> perfect

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:36.960 
the normal screws they don't perfect

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:40.610 
the normal screws they don't perfect
so<00:04:37.960> I've<00:04:38.200> dropped<00:04:38.380> that<00:04:38.590> one<00:04:38.620> in<00:04:38.890> just

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:40.620 
so I've dropped that one in just

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:43.260 
so I've dropped that one in just
basically<00:04:41.620> screw<00:04:42.010> it<00:04:42.130> so<00:04:42.310> it's<00:04:42.520> in<00:04:42.730> place<00:04:43.030> it's

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:43.270 
basically screw it so it's in place it's

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:44.700 
basically screw it so it's in place it's
holding<00:04:43.540> the<00:04:43.600> blade<00:04:43.840> in<00:04:44.020> place<00:04:44.230> which<00:04:44.440> makes

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:44.710 
holding the blade in place which makes

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:49.020 
holding the blade in place which makes
the<00:04:44.890> net<00:04:45.070> screw<00:04:45.340> a<00:04:45.610> lot<00:04:46.240> easier<00:04:46.660> to<00:04:46.810> get<00:04:46.990> in<00:04:48.030> get

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:49.030 
the net screw a lot easier to get in get

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:51.570 
the net screw a lot easier to get in get
that<00:04:49.090> in<00:04:49.330> place<00:04:49.360> you<00:04:50.100> don't<00:04:51.100> want<00:04:51.310> to<00:04:51.400> tighten

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:51.580 
that in place you don't want to tighten

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:52.920 
that in place you don't want to tighten
this<00:04:51.880> just<00:04:52.510> yet

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:52.930 
this just yet

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:55.770 
this just yet
what<00:04:53.380> finger<00:04:53.620> tighten<00:04:54.040> it<00:04:54.360> then<00:04:55.360> you<00:04:55.540> want<00:04:55.690> to

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:55.780 
what finger tighten it then you want to
