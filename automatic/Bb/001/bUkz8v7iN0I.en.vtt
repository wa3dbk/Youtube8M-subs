right now
this<00:01:15.720> is<00:01:15.930> so<00:01:16.170> important<00:01:16.890> to<00:01:17.820> show<00:01:17.850> you<00:01:18.439> how

00:01:19.539 --> 00:01:19.549 
this is so important to show you how

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:24.440 
this is so important to show you how
little<00:01:20.549> I<00:01:20.880> use<00:01:21.509> on<00:01:22.470> the<00:01:23.040> brush<00:01:23.310> you<00:01:23.790> could

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
little I use on the brush you could

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.760 
little I use on the brush you could
barely<00:01:24.930> see<00:01:26.150> any<00:01:27.150> amount<00:01:27.630> and<00:01:27.869> that<00:01:27.900> is<00:01:28.470> very

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
barely see any amount and that is very

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.280 
barely see any amount and that is very
very<00:01:29.070> important<00:01:29.729> also<00:01:29.970> to<00:01:30.329> let<00:01:30.659> you<00:01:30.780> know<00:01:30.990> it

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
very important also to let you know it

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.480 
very important also to let you know it
goes<00:01:31.590> so<00:01:32.250> far<00:01:32.610> it<00:01:33.150> is<00:01:34.020> an<00:01:34.320> opaque<00:01:34.860> coverage

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
goes so far it is an opaque coverage

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.890 
goes so far it is an opaque coverage
which<00:01:36.180> is<00:01:36.210> very<00:01:36.840> very<00:01:37.290> nice<00:01:38.090> it<00:01:39.090> will<00:01:39.450> go<00:01:39.659> right

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
which is very very nice it will go right

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:43.219 
which is very very nice it will go right
over<00:01:39.930> black<00:01:40.560> quite<00:01:41.390> comfortably<00:01:42.390> with<00:01:42.930> one

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229

coat<00:01:43.590> and<00:01:44.780> sometimes<00:01:45.780> you<00:01:46.649> know<00:01:46.770> a<00:01:46.979> second

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
coat and sometimes you know a second

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.510 
coat and sometimes you know a second
coat<00:01:47.700> might<00:01:48.090> just<00:01:48.360> help<00:01:49.290> bring<00:01:50.159> out<00:01:50.340> the

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
coat might just help bring out the

coat might just help bring out the
brightness<00:01:52.009> painting<00:01:53.009> it<00:01:53.130> in<00:01:53.280> you<00:01:53.579> could

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:54.260 
little of ink that you use that is the

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.220 
little of ink that you use that is the
best<00:02:54.710> best<00:02:55.040> way<00:02:55.190> to<00:02:55.340> use<00:02:55.700> this<00:02:55.940> you<00:02:56.660> can<00:02:56.840> always

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:57.230 
best best way to use this you can always

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:10.410 
best best way to use this you can always
put<00:02:57.470> on<00:02:57.620> a<00:02:57.650> second<00:02:58.310> light<00:02:58.490> coat<00:02:58.790> as<00:02:58.970> well

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:14.510 

oK<00:03:11.350> we've<00:03:11.890> really<00:03:12.670> accomplished<00:03:13.420> a<00:03:13.630> very<00:03:13.870> good

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:14.520 
oK we've really accomplished a very good

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:18.870 
oK we've really accomplished a very good
coloring<00:03:15.520> and<00:03:15.760> it's<00:03:16.060> quite<00:03:16.720> nice<00:03:16.930> also<00:03:17.880> enough

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:18.880 
coloring and it's quite nice also enough

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:21.559 
coloring and it's quite nice also enough
of<00:03:19.120> the<00:03:19.240> color<00:03:19.510> from<00:03:20.290> the<00:03:20.500> copper<00:03:21.010> to

of the color from the copper to

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:25.710 
of the color from the copper to

that's on the outside and I did it on

that's on the outside and I did it on
purpose<00:03:28.300> because<00:03:28.810> I<00:03:29.410> would<00:03:29.709> like<00:03:29.950> to<00:03:30.870> use<00:03:31.870> the

purpose because I would like to use the

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:38.600 
purpose because I would like to use the

darkest of these colors a you know to

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:41.790 
darkest of these colors a you know to
contrast<00:03:39.610> the<00:03:40.000> bronze<00:03:40.300> and<00:03:40.900> go<00:03:41.200> with<00:03:41.410> some<00:03:41.680> of

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:41.800 
contrast the bronze and go with some of

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:43.080 
contrast the bronze and go with some of
the<00:03:41.860> lighter<00:03:42.130> colors<00:03:42.610> that<00:03:42.790> I'm<00:03:42.910> going<00:03:43.060> to

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:43.090 
the lighter colors that I'm going to

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:45.510 
the lighter colors that I'm going to
talk<00:03:43.270> about<00:03:43.450> in<00:03:43.690> just<00:03:43.720> one<00:03:44.050> second<00:03:44.560> in<00:03:44.800> more

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:45.520 
talk about in just one second in more

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:49.680 
talk about in just one second in more
into<00:03:45.970> the<00:03:46.090> inner<00:03:46.330> part<00:03:47.640> this<00:03:48.640> I<00:03:48.970> believe<00:03:49.450> would

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:49.690 
into the inner part this I believe would

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:52.009 
into the inner part this I believe would
really<00:03:50.200> really<00:03:50.590> stand<00:03:51.130> out<00:03:51.310> quite<00:03:51.700> nicely

00:03:52.009 --> 00:03:52.019 
really really stand out quite nicely

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:55.440 
really really stand out quite nicely
doing<00:03:53.019> copper<00:03:53.590> so<00:03:54.400> this<00:03:54.610> gives<00:03:54.940> it<00:03:55.120> a<00:03:55.209> nice

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:55.450 
doing copper so this gives it a nice

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:57.840 
doing copper so this gives it a nice
balance<00:03:56.230> where<00:03:56.530> we<00:03:56.560> have<00:03:56.920> copper<00:03:57.519> on<00:03:57.670> the

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:57.850 
balance where we have copper on the

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:00.720 
balance where we have copper on the
outer<00:03:58.060> edges<00:03:58.480> and<00:03:59.080> copper<00:03:59.980> it<00:04:00.100> right<00:04:00.280> here<00:04:00.550> on

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:00.730 
outer edges and copper it right here on

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:06.750 
outer edges and copper it right here on
the<00:04:00.850> inside<00:04:02.100> and<00:04:04.230> again<00:04:05.230> you<00:04:05.530> could<00:04:05.680> see<00:04:06.010> how

on so many surfaces as we later found
out<00:04:35.219> so<00:04:35.669> many<00:04:35.849> good<00:04:36.210> things<00:04:36.240> about<00:04:36.889> playing

slicker surfaces you'll know just the

dry it that's all I can stress to you

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:03.499 
dry it that's all I can stress to you
and<00:05:00.599> then<00:05:00.840> not<00:05:01.199> handle<00:05:02.009> it<00:05:02.129> don't<00:05:02.699> allow<00:05:03.240> it<00:05:03.479> to

properly dry most importantly it is

00:05:10.379 --> 00:05:13.010 
properly dry most importantly it is
meant<00:05:10.680> for<00:05:10.800> detail<00:05:11.400> painting<00:05:12.030> and<00:05:12.210> that<00:05:12.389> do<00:05:12.750> an

other things I did I created gorgeous
color<00:05:24.629> and<00:05:25.460> I<00:05:26.460> am<00:05:26.550> now<00:05:27.060> calling<00:05:27.599> it<00:05:27.719> teal<00:05:28.340> and

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:29.960 
color and I am now calling it teal and

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:34.189 
color and I am now calling it teal and
it<00:05:30.960> is<00:05:31.199> actually<00:05:31.590> an<00:05:32.099> equal<00:05:33.090> combination<00:05:33.960> of

00:05:34.189 --> 00:05:34.199 
it is actually an equal combination of

00:05:34.199 --> 00:05:38.540 
it is actually an equal combination of
blazing<00:05:34.889> blue<00:05:36.409> with<00:05:37.409> the<00:05:37.529> metallic<00:05:38.039> ink<00:05:38.279> and

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:38.550 
blazing blue with the metallic ink and

the<00:05:39.830> emerald<00:05:40.830> gloss<00:05:41.190> all<00:05:42.089> I<00:05:42.150> did<00:05:42.719> was<00:05:42.930> to<00:05:43.080> take

00:05:43.129 --> 00:05:43.139 
the emerald gloss all I did was to take

00:05:43.139 --> 00:05:46.279 
the emerald gloss all I did was to take
equal<00:05:43.949> amounts<00:05:44.430> on<00:05:44.550> a<00:05:44.580> craft<00:05:45.060> stick<00:05:45.389> and<00:05:46.080> then

00:05:46.279 --> 00:05:46.289 
equal amounts on a craft stick and then

00:05:46.289 --> 00:05:48.230 
equal amounts on a craft stick and then
I<00:05:46.319> put<00:05:46.680> them<00:05:46.770> in<00:05:46.919> my<00:05:47.099> hand<00:05:47.400> a<00:05:47.520> little<00:05:47.699> container

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:48.240 
I put them in my hand a little container
