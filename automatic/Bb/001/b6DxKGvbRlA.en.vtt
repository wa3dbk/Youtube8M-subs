00:04:48.469 --> 00:04:48.479 
course this year he definitely did not

00:04:48.479 --> 00:04:50.300 
course this year he definitely did not
deserve<00:04:48.960> it<00:04:49.110> but<00:04:49.229> than<00:04:49.440> that<00:04:49.560> he<00:04:50.039> has<00:04:50.130> been

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:50.310 
deserve it but than that he has been

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:51.439 
deserve it but than that he has been
known<00:04:50.490> as<00:04:50.639> been<00:04:50.789> one<00:04:50.940> of<00:04:51.000> the<00:04:51.090> better<00:04:51.210> right

00:04:51.439 --> 00:04:51.449 
known as been one of the better right

00:04:51.449 --> 00:04:53.330 
known as been one of the better right
backs<00:04:51.690> in<00:04:51.810> the<00:04:51.900> world<00:04:52.110> and<00:04:52.289> potentially<00:04:53.220> I<00:04:53.250> was

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:53.340 
backs in the world and potentially I was

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:55.070 
backs in the world and potentially I was
like<00:04:53.460> six<00:04:53.759> years<00:04:53.850> or<00:04:54.090> so<00:04:54.240> now<00:04:54.270> but<00:04:54.720> the<00:04:54.810> theory

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:55.080 
like six years or so now but the theory

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:56.719 
like six years or so now but the theory
would<00:04:55.440> be<00:04:55.500> that<00:04:55.620> much<00:04:55.860> apparent<00:04:56.310> around<00:04:56.490> five

00:04:56.719 --> 00:04:56.729 
would be that much apparent around five

00:04:56.729 --> 00:04:58.430 
would be that much apparent around five
million<00:04:56.970> pounds<00:04:57.330> that<00:04:57.419> does<00:04:57.600> for<00:04:57.870> me<00:04:57.960> suggest

00:04:58.430 --> 00:04:58.440 
million pounds that does for me suggest

00:04:58.440 --> 00:04:59.930 
million pounds that does for me suggest
the<00:04:58.590> edible<00:04:58.919> long<00:04:59.039> left-handers<00:04:59.460> contract

00:04:59.930 --> 00:04:59.940 
the edible long left-handers contract

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:01.100 
the edible long left-handers contract
and<00:05:00.360> yeah<00:05:00.449> this<00:05:00.630> would<00:05:00.750> be<00:05:00.810> quite<00:05:01.020> an

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:01.110 
and yeah this would be quite an

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:02.659 
and yeah this would be quite an
interesting<00:05:01.350> one<00:05:01.590> to<00:05:01.620> see<00:05:01.860> so<00:05:02.220> then<00:05:02.370> guys<00:05:02.490> ask
