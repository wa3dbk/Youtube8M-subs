that's<00:01:45.110> what<00:01:45.380> they<00:01:45.530> did

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:46.070 
that's what they did

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:47.980 
that's what they did
the<00:01:46.369> s1r<00:01:46.880> that<00:01:47.119> you<00:01:47.180> see<00:01:47.360> in<00:01:47.450> front<00:01:47.600> of<00:01:47.720> me<00:01:47.780> is<00:01:47.960> a

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:47.990 
the s1r that you see in front of me is a

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:50.410 
the s1r that you see in front of me is a
brand<00:01:48.470> new<00:01:48.770> system<00:01:49.220> from<00:01:49.340> these<00:01:49.580> guys<00:01:49.729> it's

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:50.420 
brand new system from these guys it's

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:52.480 
brand new system from these guys it's
going<00:01:50.539> to<00:01:50.600> be<00:01:50.690> an<00:01:50.780> upgrade<00:01:51.020> over<00:01:51.410> the<00:01:51.590> older<00:01:52.039> m2

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:52.490 
going to be an upgrade over the older m2

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:54.639 
going to be an upgrade over the older m2
system<00:01:52.970> in<00:01:53.119> the<00:01:53.509> way<00:01:53.690> that<00:01:53.869> it<00:01:53.959> mounts<00:01:54.380> to<00:01:54.470> the

00:01:54.639 --> 00:01:54.649 
system in the way that it mounts to the

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:57.309 
system in the way that it mounts to the
actual<00:01:55.280> motorcycle<00:01:55.640> header<00:01:56.060> pipe<00:01:56.270> the<00:01:56.780> old<00:01:56.929> m2

00:01:57.309 --> 00:01:57.319 
actual motorcycle header pipe the old m2

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:58.930 
actual motorcycle header pipe the old m2
used<00:01:57.560> a<00:01:57.679> valve<00:01:57.890> system<00:01:58.099> it<00:01:58.310> actually<00:01:58.610> hard

00:01:58.930 --> 00:01:58.940 
used a valve system it actually hard

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:00.790 
used a valve system it actually hard
mount<00:01:59.119> it<00:01:59.209> on<00:01:59.360> here<00:01:59.630> with<00:02:00.050> the<00:02:00.170> s1r<00:02:00.560> you're

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:00.800 
mount it on here with the s1r you're

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:01.809 
mount it on here with the s1r you're
going<00:02:00.920> to<00:02:00.979> see<00:02:01.130> it's<00:02:01.280> going<00:02:01.369> to<00:02:01.459> be<00:02:01.550> a<00:02:01.580> new

00:02:01.809 --> 00:02:01.819 
going to see it's going to be a new

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:03.730 
going to see it's going to be a new
spring<00:02:02.209> system<00:02:02.690> you're<00:02:03.140> also<00:02:03.259> going<00:02:03.470> to<00:02:03.530> see<00:02:03.590> a

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:03.740 
spring system you're also going to see a

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:06.249 
spring system you're also going to see a
sleeker<00:02:04.250> design<00:02:04.300> carbon<00:02:05.300> fiber<00:02:05.569> and<00:02:05.810> again

00:02:06.249 --> 00:02:06.259 
sleeker design carbon fiber and again

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:07.839 
sleeker design carbon fiber and again
the<00:02:06.380> end<00:02:06.590> cap<00:02:06.890> is<00:02:06.920> going<00:02:07.220> to<00:02:07.280> kind<00:02:07.459> of<00:02:07.550> slash

00:02:07.839 --> 00:02:07.849 
the end cap is going to kind of slash

00:02:07.849 --> 00:02:09.130 
the end cap is going to kind of slash
out<00:02:08.149> a<00:02:08.179> little<00:02:08.420> bit<00:02:08.509> and<00:02:08.630> just<00:02:08.690> give<00:02:08.929> you<00:02:08.990> that

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:09.140 
out a little bit and just give you that

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:11.650 
out a little bit and just give you that
new<00:02:09.380> more<00:02:09.830> modern<00:02:09.979> aesthetic<00:02:10.700> to<00:02:10.880> it<00:02:10.910> so<00:02:11.450> let's

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:11.660 
new more modern aesthetic to it so let's

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:13.030 
new more modern aesthetic to it so let's
break<00:02:11.900> this<00:02:11.959> down<00:02:12.290> and<00:02:12.470> take<00:02:12.590> a<00:02:12.620> closer<00:02:12.920> look

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
break this down and take a closer look

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:14.589 
break this down and take a closer look
at<00:02:13.310> both<00:02:13.550> the<00:02:13.730> systems<00:02:14.060> you<00:02:14.150> see<00:02:14.270> on<00:02:14.360> the<00:02:14.450> table

00:02:14.589 --> 00:02:14.599 
at both the systems you see on the table

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:16.270 
at both the systems you see on the table
starting<00:02:15.410> with<00:02:15.500> the<00:02:15.590> slip-on<00:02:15.920> on<00:02:16.040> my<00:02:16.099> right

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:16.280 
starting with the slip-on on my right

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:18.580 
starting with the slip-on on my right
hand<00:02:16.370> side<00:02:16.640> so<00:02:16.910> the<00:02:17.630> slip-on<00:02:17.959> exhaust<00:02:18.380> is

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.590 
hand side so the slip-on exhaust is

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:19.870 
hand side so the slip-on exhaust is
going<00:02:18.739> to<00:02:18.800> give<00:02:18.920> you<00:02:19.040> three<00:02:19.400> main<00:02:19.610> things

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:19.880 
going to give you three main things

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:22.300 
going to give you three main things
first<00:02:20.599> of<00:02:20.750> all<00:02:20.840> it's<00:02:21.110> that<00:02:21.560> sound<00:02:21.950> it's<00:02:22.190> that

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:22.310 
first of all it's that sound it's that

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:23.650 
first of all it's that sound it's that
two<00:02:22.489> buzzer<00:02:22.670> sound<00:02:23.030> we've<00:02:23.239> come<00:02:23.420> to<00:02:23.510> know

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:23.660 
two buzzer sound we've come to know

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:25.089 
two buzzer sound we've come to know
we've<00:02:23.840> come<00:02:24.020> to<00:02:24.110> love<00:02:24.260> it<00:02:24.500> hasn't<00:02:25.069> changed

00:02:25.089 --> 00:02:25.099 
we've come to love it hasn't changed

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:26.979 
we've come to love it hasn't changed
it's<00:02:25.610> just<00:02:25.819> going<00:02:25.940> to<00:02:26.030> beef<00:02:26.330> up<00:02:26.540> the<00:02:26.690> tone<00:02:26.959> of

00:02:26.979 --> 00:02:26.989 
it's just going to beef up the tone of

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:29.260 
it's just going to beef up the tone of
your<00:02:27.260> bike<00:02:27.500> the<00:02:28.160> second<00:02:28.550> thing<00:02:28.760> is<00:02:28.910> weight

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:29.270 
your bike the second thing is weight

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:31.120 
your bike the second thing is weight
savings<00:02:29.690> so<00:02:30.170> what<00:02:30.349> you<00:02:30.470> really<00:02:30.650> see<00:02:30.920> with<00:02:31.069> the

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:31.130 
savings so what you really see with the

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:32.920 
savings so what you really see with the
construction<00:02:31.670> here<00:02:31.849> is<00:02:32.000> a<00:02:32.239> huge<00:02:32.690> weight

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:32.930 
construction here is a huge weight

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:34.750 
construction here is a huge weight
savings<00:02:33.349> depending<00:02:33.890> on<00:02:34.130> your<00:02:34.250> bike<00:02:34.400> now<00:02:34.640> with

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:34.760 
savings depending on your bike now with

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:36.910 
savings depending on your bike now with
the<00:02:34.880> r6<00:02:35.270> dropped<00:02:35.900> about<00:02:36.110> a<00:02:36.140> half<00:02:36.349> a<00:02:36.470> pound<00:02:36.650> for

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920 
the r6 dropped about a half a pound for

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:38.530 
the r6 dropped about a half a pound for
just<00:02:37.160> a<00:02:37.250> slip-on<00:02:37.610> but<00:02:38.000> when<00:02:38.120> we<00:02:38.180> talk<00:02:38.360> about

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:38.540 
just a slip-on but when we talk about

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:39.820 
just a slip-on but when we talk about
the<00:02:38.630> full<00:02:38.840> system<00:02:39.170> you're<00:02:39.290> going<00:02:39.380> to<00:02:39.440> see<00:02:39.680> the

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:39.830 
the full system you're going to see the

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:40.960 
the full system you're going to see the
weight<00:02:39.980> savings<00:02:40.400> is<00:02:40.520> going<00:02:40.610> to<00:02:40.730> increase

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:40.970 
weight savings is going to increase

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:43.600 
weight savings is going to increase
incrementally<00:02:41.569> so<00:02:42.099> what<00:02:43.099> the<00:02:43.190> construction

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:43.610 
incrementally so what the construction

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:44.740 
incrementally so what the construction
is<00:02:43.880> with<00:02:44.030> this<00:02:44.180> is<00:02:44.360> you're<00:02:44.450> going<00:02:44.540> to<00:02:44.599> have

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:44.750 
is with this is you're going to have

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:46.300 
is with this is you're going to have
stainless<00:02:45.080> steel<00:02:45.470> and<00:02:45.620> they<00:02:45.680> use<00:02:45.800> a<00:02:45.830> stainless

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:46.310 
stainless steel and they use a stainless

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:48.699 
stainless steel and they use a stainless
steel<00:02:46.340> inlet<00:02:47.120> to<00:02:47.540> match<00:02:47.750> up<00:02:48.050> with<00:02:48.379> the<00:02:48.560> actual

00:02:48.699 --> 00:02:48.709 
steel inlet to match up with the actual

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:50.290 
steel inlet to match up with the actual
header<00:02:49.190> system<00:02:49.580> and<00:02:49.700> they<00:02:49.760> do<00:02:49.819> that<00:02:50.060> for

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:50.300 
header system and they do that for

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:52.030 
header system and they do that for
strength<00:02:50.629> when<00:02:51.170> you<00:02:51.260> get<00:02:51.379> to<00:02:51.470> the<00:02:51.560> output

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:52.040 
strength when you get to the output

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:54.190 
strength when you get to the output
you're<00:02:52.879> going<00:02:53.000> to<00:02:53.060> have<00:02:53.209> an<00:02:53.330> aluminum<00:02:53.660> output

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:54.200 
you're going to have an aluminum output

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:55.930 
you're going to have an aluminum output
with<00:02:54.379> a<00:02:54.410> magnesium<00:02:54.800> end<00:02:55.129> cap<00:02:55.310> and<00:02:55.489> then<00:02:55.849> you

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:55.940 
with a magnesium end cap and then you

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:57.220 
with a magnesium end cap and then you
have<00:02:56.060> steel<00:02:56.360> rivets<00:02:56.690> holding<00:02:56.810> the<00:02:57.080> whole

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:57.230 
have steel rivets holding the whole

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:59.410 
have steel rivets holding the whole
thing<00:02:57.260> together<00:02:57.560> all<00:02:58.220> in<00:02:58.280> all<00:02:58.670> it's<00:02:58.940> a<00:02:59.090> nice

00:02:59.410 --> 00:02:59.420 
thing together all in all it's a nice

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:01.940 
thing together all in all it's a nice
weight<00:02:59.840> savings<00:03:00.290> from<00:03:00.710> two<00:03:00.950> brothers<00:03:01.280> and<00:03:01.460> the

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
weight savings from two brothers and the

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:03.050 
weight savings from two brothers and the
whole<00:03:02.010> thing<00:03:02.190> is<00:03:02.310> really<00:03:02.640> nice<00:03:02.819> in<00:03:02.970> his

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
whole thing is really nice in his

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:04.880 
whole thing is really nice in his
construction<00:03:03.360> the<00:03:04.050> third<00:03:04.349> reason<00:03:04.560> you<00:03:04.770> want

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:04.890 
construction the third reason you want

power just putting the slip on system on

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:10.940 
power just putting the slip on system on
is<00:03:09.360> going<00:03:09.510> to<00:03:09.569> increase<00:03:09.870> your<00:03:09.989> power<00:03:10.349> by<00:03:10.709> about

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950 
is going to increase your power by about

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:12.589 
is going to increase your power by about
two<00:03:11.250> and<00:03:11.340> a<00:03:11.400> half<00:03:11.459> horsepower<00:03:11.879> on<00:03:12.269> something

a<00:03:14.700> lot<00:03:14.910> but<00:03:15.150> that's<00:03:15.599> going<00:03:15.720> to<00:03:15.780> be<00:03:15.870> about<00:03:15.959> a

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:16.080 
a lot but that's going to be about a

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:18.620 
a lot but that's going to be about a
three<00:03:16.470> and<00:03:16.590> a<00:03:16.709> half<00:03:16.920> percent<00:03:17.160> power<00:03:17.610> gain<00:03:17.970> just

three and a half percent power gain just

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:20.300 
three and a half percent power gain just
from<00:03:18.750> putting<00:03:18.870> an<00:03:19.019> exhaust<00:03:19.349> system<00:03:19.440> on<00:03:19.769> and<00:03:19.980> if

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
from putting an exhaust system on and if

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:21.890 
from putting an exhaust system on and if
you<00:03:20.400> look<00:03:20.670> at<00:03:20.790> the<00:03:20.880> dyno<00:03:21.090> chart<00:03:21.420> for<00:03:21.599> this<00:03:21.720> it

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:21.900 
you look at the dyno chart for this it

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:24.020 
you look at the dyno chart for this it
increases<00:03:22.890> your<00:03:22.920> horsepower<00:03:23.459> throughout<00:03:23.910> the

entire rev range from 4,000 up to 16,000
rpm<00:03:27.420> you<00:03:27.569> get<00:03:27.690> a<00:03:27.720> nice<00:03:27.989> even<00:03:28.530> keeled<00:03:28.799> bump

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:29.160 
rpm you get a nice even keeled bump

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:30.800 
rpm you get a nice even keeled bump
that's<00:03:29.640> going<00:03:29.910> to<00:03:29.970> be<00:03:30.030> a<00:03:30.060> nice<00:03:30.330> addition<00:03:30.780> to

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
that's going to be a nice addition to

through this full system on here you're

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:07.729 
through this full system on here you're
going<00:04:06.569> to<00:04:06.630> get<00:04:06.810> about<00:04:07.079> four<00:04:07.560> and<00:04:07.620> a<00:04:07.709> half

00:04:07.729 --> 00:04:07.739 
going to get about four and a half

horsepower increase on the AR six and

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:11.599 
horsepower increase on the AR six and
again<00:04:10.380> comparable<00:04:11.130> to<00:04:11.190> the<00:04:11.280> bike<00:04:11.430> that<00:04:11.519> you

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:11.609 
again comparable to the bike that you

00:04:11.609 --> 00:04:13.430 
again comparable to the bike that you
have<00:04:11.760> in<00:04:11.880> the<00:04:11.970> garage<00:04:12.090> about<00:04:12.959> four<00:04:13.319> to<00:04:13.410> five

power in this step design first and

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:21.259 
power in this step design first and
foremost<00:04:20.100> we've<00:04:20.250> eliminated<00:04:20.519> the<00:04:20.820> catalytic

00:04:21.259 --> 00:04:21.269 
foremost we've eliminated the catalytic

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:23.120 
foremost we've eliminated the catalytic
converter<00:04:21.329> so<00:04:22.109> the<00:04:22.229> exhaust<00:04:22.560> gases<00:04:23.010> are

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:23.130 
converter so the exhaust gases are

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:24.529 
converter so the exhaust gases are
automatically<00:04:23.760> moving<00:04:24.000> here<00:04:24.240> a<00:04:24.270> little<00:04:24.360> bit

Chamber's slowly get bigger as they move
down<00:04:31.889> the<00:04:32.160> four<00:04:32.639> into<00:04:32.970> one<00:04:33.000> system<00:04:33.450> the<00:04:34.200> reason

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:34.590 
down the four into one system the reason

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:37.070 
down the four into one system the reason
they<00:04:34.710> do<00:04:34.770> that<00:04:34.979> is<00:04:35.340> as<00:04:35.850> the<00:04:36.030> exhaust<00:04:36.600> gas<00:04:36.870> is

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:37.080 
they do that is as the exhaust gas is

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:39.469 
they do that is as the exhaust gas is
moving<00:04:37.289> the<00:04:37.530> bigger<00:04:37.710> chamber<00:04:38.310> they<00:04:38.760> expand<00:04:39.419> to

00:04:39.469 --> 00:04:39.479 
moving the bigger chamber they expand to

00:04:39.479 --> 00:04:41.330 
moving the bigger chamber they expand to
fill<00:04:39.720> the<00:04:39.840> chamber<00:04:40.020> as<00:04:40.350> they<00:04:40.740> expand<00:04:41.100> to<00:04:41.160> fill

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:41.340 
fill the chamber as they expand to fill

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:43.460 
fill the chamber as they expand to fill
the<00:04:41.430> chamber<00:04:41.610> they<00:04:42.060> speed<00:04:42.450> up<00:04:42.479> and<00:04:42.780> they<00:04:43.169> move

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:43.470 
the chamber they speed up and they move

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:45.560 
the chamber they speed up and they move
through<00:04:43.710> the<00:04:43.860> entire<00:04:44.130> system<00:04:44.520> faster<00:04:44.910> giving

it has a servo motor you're going to

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:37.790 
it has a servo motor you're going to
have<00:05:36.090> to<00:05:36.270> remove<00:05:36.630> that<00:05:36.870> to<00:05:37.080> install<00:05:37.470> this<00:05:37.650> so

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:37.800 
have to remove that to install this so

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:39.200
