this<00:00:48.300> is<00:00:48.450> my<00:00:48.600> favorite<00:00:49.469> thing<00:00:49.590> in<00:00:49.680> the<00:00:49.739> world

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
this is my favorite thing in the world

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.069

so<00:00:50.399> you<00:00:50.460> basically<00:00:50.670> have<00:00:50.910> a<00:00:51.030> just<00:00:51.690> a<00:00:51.750> standard

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
so you basically have a just a standard

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:55.040 
so you basically have a just a standard
guitar<00:00:52.730> neck<00:00:53.730> and<00:00:54.000> you<00:00:54.539> can<00:00:54.690> go<00:00:54.809> up<00:00:54.899> and<00:00:54.989> down

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
guitar neck and you can go up and down

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.600 
guitar neck and you can go up and down
the<00:00:55.289> fretboard<00:00:55.739> just<00:00:56.129> like<00:00:56.219> you<00:00:56.309> would<00:00:56.460> play

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
the fretboard just like you would play

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.729 
the fretboard just like you would play
right<00:00:56.850> and<00:00:57.059> it's<00:00:57.539> all<00:00:57.750> MIDI<00:00:58.199> out<00:00:58.350> so<00:00:58.620> it's

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
right and it's all MIDI out so it's

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.979 
right and it's all MIDI out so it's
going<00:00:58.920> into<00:00:59.250> an<00:00:59.340> iPad<00:00:59.670> or<00:00:59.699> a<00:01:00.270> computer<00:01:00.539> or

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
going into an iPad or a computer or

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.700 
going into an iPad or a computer or
whatever<00:01:01.109> else<00:01:01.440> correct<00:01:02.100> it<00:01:02.370> interfaces<00:01:03.180> with

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:03.710 
whatever else correct it interfaces with

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:08.260 
whatever else correct it interfaces with
both<00:01:04.710> Mac<00:01:04.979> OS<00:01:05.339> core<00:01:06.150> MIDI<00:01:06.360> and<00:01:06.630> iOS<00:01:07.590> core<00:01:07.860> Mini

can be controlled with the jam stick it

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.340 
can be controlled with the jam stick it

world of MIDI that's been around for a
long<00:01:30.270> time<00:01:30.509> and<00:01:30.659> how<00:01:30.780> is<00:01:30.990> how<00:01:31.350> is<00:01:31.770> this<00:01:31.860> sensing

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
long time and how is how is this sensing

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.550 
long time and how is how is this sensing
the<00:01:32.400> string<00:01:32.640> and<00:01:33.030> the<00:01:33.150> mood

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:33.560 
the string and the mood

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.399 
the string and the mood
movements<00:01:34.159> here<00:01:34.310> we<00:01:35.240> have<00:01:35.390> IR<00:01:35.780> sensors<00:01:36.200> that

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:36.409 
movements here we have IR sensors that

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:38.350 
movements here we have IR sensors that
are<00:01:36.530> underneath<00:01:36.770> this<00:01:37.070> fretboards<00:01:37.909> actually

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:38.360 
are underneath this fretboards actually

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:40.600 
are underneath this fretboards actually
I<00:01:38.390> are<00:01:38.720> transparent<00:01:39.409> so<00:01:39.860> it's<00:01:40.250> a<00:01:40.399> patented

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:40.610 
I are transparent so it's a patented

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:43.029 
I are transparent so it's a patented
system<00:01:40.939> it<00:01:41.899> actually<00:01:42.229> uses<00:01:42.380> light<00:01:42.710> to<00:01:42.920> read

00:01:43.029 --> 00:01:43.039 
system it actually uses light to read

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:44.289 
system it actually uses light to read
your<00:01:43.159> fingertips<00:01:43.520> it's<00:01:43.759> actually<00:01:44.060> pretty

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:44.299 
your fingertips it's actually pretty

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:47.080 
your fingertips it's actually pretty
pretty<00:01:44.930> fast<00:01:45.259> very<00:01:45.680> advanced<00:01:46.189> okay<00:01:46.850> so<00:01:46.909> why

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:47.090 
pretty fast very advanced okay so why

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:55.060 
pretty fast very advanced okay so why
don't<00:01:47.210> you<00:01:47.270> try<00:01:47.390> to<00:01:47.479> play<00:01:47.689> a<00:01:47.720> little<00:01:47.960> uh

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:08.149 
so right now we're just doing a acoustic

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:12.370

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:14.530 
guitar in GarageBand touch iOS is really
a<00:02:12.590> neat<00:02:13.250> technical<00:02:13.730> development<00:02:14.150> but<00:02:14.270> when<00:02:14.420> it

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.540 
a neat technical development but when it

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:16.570 
a neat technical development but when it
comes<00:02:14.690> to<00:02:14.840> playability<00:02:15.230> for<00:02:16.040> garage<00:02:16.250> band

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:16.580 
comes to playability for garage band

you<00:02:36.590> know<00:02:36.739> a<00:02:37.100> little<00:02:37.370> cooler<00:02:39.910> like<00:02:40.910> a

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:40.940 
you know a little cooler like a

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:45.900 
you know a little cooler like a
synthesizer

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:45.910 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:48.750 

so<00:02:46.420> I'm<00:02:46.510> able<00:02:46.630> to<00:02:46.840> control<00:02:47.370> and<00:02:48.370> move<00:02:48.490> up<00:02:48.640> an

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:48.760 
so I'm able to control and move up an

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:54.150 
so I'm able to control and move up an
octave<00:02:48.880> here<00:02:49.240> see<00:02:49.450> if<00:02:49.510> that<00:02:49.660> works

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:54.160 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:58.990 

but<00:02:55.160> it's<00:02:55.460> you<00:02:55.730> know<00:02:55.790> it's<00:02:56.090> all<00:02:56.270> MIDI<00:02:58.000> we've

00:02:58.990 --> 00:02:59.000 
but it's you know it's all MIDI we've

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.640 
but it's you know it's all MIDI we've
got<00:02:59.240> a<00:02:59.510> handful<00:02:59.990> of<00:03:00.080> apps<00:03:00.290> that<00:03:00.440> we're

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:00.650 
got a handful of apps that we're

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:02.640 
got a handful of apps that we're
developing<00:03:00.890> right<00:03:01.130> now<00:03:01.310> a<00:03:01.670> tutor<00:03:02.000> app<00:03:02.180> that

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:02.650 
developing right now a tutor app that

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:06.070 
developing right now a tutor app that
will<00:03:03.650> it<00:03:04.130> reads<00:03:04.700> what<00:03:05.000> you're<00:03:05.150> doing<00:03:05.450> we

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:06.080 
will it reads what you're doing we

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:08.140 
will it reads what you're doing we
actually<00:03:06.410> have<00:03:06.560> a<00:03:06.590> kind<00:03:07.190> of<00:03:07.280> a<00:03:07.370> reworking<00:03:07.790> of<00:03:08.030> a

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:08.150 
actually have a kind of a reworking of a

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:10.600 
actually have a kind of a reworking of a
popular<00:03:08.630> video<00:03:08.900> game<00:03:09.140> so<00:03:10.100> instead<00:03:10.370> of<00:03:10.430> having

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:10.610 
popular video game so instead of having

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:11.920 
popular video game so instead of having
five<00:03:10.910> dots<00:03:11.240> that<00:03:11.420> you're<00:03:11.600> just<00:03:11.750> chasing

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:11.930 
five dots that you're just chasing

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:13.570 
five dots that you're just chasing
around<00:03:12.170> you<00:03:12.560> actually<00:03:12.890> have<00:03:13.040> six<00:03:13.340> strings

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:13.580 
around you actually have six strings

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:16.330 
around you actually have six strings
that<00:03:14.030> are<00:03:14.180> kind<00:03:14.450> of<00:03:14.510> firing<00:03:14.750> at<00:03:15.110> you<00:03:15.800> cords

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:16.340 
that are kind of firing at you cords

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:18.700 
that are kind of firing at you cords
notes<00:03:16.700> internet<00:03:17.420> I<00:03:17.570> could<00:03:17.720> tell<00:03:17.900> sure<00:03:18.410> and

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:18.710 
notes internet I could tell sure and

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:19.960 
notes internet I could tell sure and
you're<00:03:18.830> actually<00:03:18.980> playing<00:03:19.280> you're<00:03:19.700> actually

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:19.970 
you're actually playing you're actually

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:21.940 
you're actually playing you're actually
playing<00:03:20.090> a<00:03:20.180> real<00:03:20.360> guitar<00:03:20.540> yeah<00:03:21.260> because<00:03:21.620> these

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:21.950 
playing a real guitar yeah because these

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:23.560 
playing a real guitar yeah because these
strings<00:03:22.280> are<00:03:22.430> they're<00:03:22.700> not<00:03:22.730> tuned<00:03:23.090> per<00:03:23.330> se<00:03:23.510> but

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:23.570 
strings are they're not tuned per se but

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:25.600 
strings are they're not tuned per se but
they're<00:03:23.990> that<00:03:24.620> they<00:03:24.800> move<00:03:25.310> they're<00:03:25.490> real

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:25.610 
they're that they move they're real

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:27.100 
they're that they move they're real
guitars<00:03:25.940> -<00:03:26.060> yeah<00:03:26.300> they<00:03:26.420> own<00:03:26.510> the<00:03:26.570> same<00:03:26.720> action

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:27.110 
guitars - yeah they own the same action

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:28.750 
guitars - yeah they own the same action
it's<00:03:27.200> engagement<00:03:27.620> it's<00:03:27.770> a<00:03:27.860> ten<00:03:28.070> gauge<00:03:28.310> so<00:03:28.550> it's

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:28.760 
it's engagement it's a ten gauge so it's

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:33.730 
it's engagement it's a ten gauge so it's
ten<00:03:29.090> to<00:03:29.210> forty<00:03:29.480> six<00:03:29.720> five<00:03:30.590> real<00:03:31.010> frets<00:03:31.370> 6105<00:03:32.740> so

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:33.740 
ten to forty six five real frets 6105 so

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:35.620 
ten to forty six five real frets 6105 so
it's<00:03:33.890> a<00:03:33.980> it's<00:03:34.190> a<00:03:34.340> far<00:03:34.790> as<00:03:34.880> guitar<00:03:35.210> playing<00:03:35.450> goes

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:35.630 
it's a it's a far as guitar playing goes

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:37.720 
it's a it's a far as guitar playing goes
we<00:03:36.500> nailed<00:03:36.740> the<00:03:36.860> experience<00:03:37.280> pretty<00:03:37.430> close

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:37.730 
we nailed the experience pretty close

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:39.400 
we nailed the experience pretty close

keeps everybody on their make excuse the

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:00.520 
keeps everybody on their make excuse the
brain<00:03:58.880> quick<00:03:59.150> yeah<00:03:59.540> definitely<00:04:00.200> one<00:04:00.320> of<00:04:00.440> the

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:00.530 
brain quick yeah definitely one of the

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:02.860 
brain quick yeah definitely one of the
other<00:04:00.620> nice<00:04:00.920> things<00:04:01.280> about<00:04:01.460> having<00:04:01.970> this<00:04:02.090> the

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:02.870 
other nice things about having this the

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:04.300 
other nice things about having this the
sensing<00:04:03.290> system<00:04:03.620> under<00:04:03.830> there<00:04:03.980> is<00:04:04.100> we<00:04:04.220> don't

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:04.310 
sensing system under there is we don't

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:06.490 
sensing system under there is we don't
have<00:04:04.400> to<00:04:04.580> have<00:04:04.670> a<00:04:04.700> guitar<00:04:04.910> on<00:04:05.150> to<00:04:05.540> one<00:04:06.350> it's

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:06.500 
have to have a guitar on to one it's

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:08.320 
have to have a guitar on to one it's
fast<00:04:06.800> so<00:04:07.040> there's<00:04:07.220> very<00:04:07.430> little<00:04:07.580> latency<00:04:08.090> and

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:08.330 
fast so there's very little latency and

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:09.790 
fast so there's very little latency and
we<00:04:08.450> don't<00:04:08.630> have<00:04:08.750> to<00:04:08.870> constantly<00:04:09.050> tune<00:04:09.620> the

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:09.800 
we don't have to constantly tune the

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:12.220
