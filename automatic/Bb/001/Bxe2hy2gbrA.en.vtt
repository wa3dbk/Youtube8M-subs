respawning<00:00:38.879> the<00:00:38.969> bat<00:00:39.120> in<00:00:39.360> this<00:00:39.510> rapid<00:00:40.110> method

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
respawning the bat in this rapid method

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.560 
respawning the bat in this rapid method
though<00:00:40.559> does<00:00:40.920> seem<00:00:41.190> to<00:00:41.219> cause<00:00:41.520> a<00:00:41.550> bug<00:00:41.940> up<00:00:42.239> close

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
though does seem to cause a bug up close

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.340 
though does seem to cause a bug up close
so<00:00:43.440> a<00:00:43.469> jump<00:00:43.860> distance<00:00:44.190> or<00:00:44.340> closer<00:00:45.110> cast<00:00:46.110> in<00:00:46.260> the

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
so a jump distance or closer cast in the

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.470 
so a jump distance or closer cast in the
back<00:00:46.500> instantly<00:00:47.250> will<00:00:47.700> cause<00:00:47.879> the<00:00:48.120> map<00:00:48.300> to

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
back instantly will cause the map to

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.760 
back instantly will cause the map to
vanish<00:00:48.800> okay<00:00:49.800> so<00:00:50.550> get<00:00:50.940> the<00:00:51.059> bat<00:00:51.239> ready<00:00:51.480> and

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:51.770 
vanish okay so get the bat ready and

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:54.740 
vanish okay so get the bat ready and
then<00:00:52.770> Buffett<00:00:53.250> our<00:00:53.399> bike<00:00:53.579> immediately<00:00:53.760> threes

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
then Buffett our bike immediately threes

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.619 
then Buffett our bike immediately threes
already<00:00:54.899> pressed<00:00:55.410> bat<00:00:56.100> vanishes<00:00:56.550> the<00:00:57.539> issue

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
already pressed bat vanishes the issue

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.779 
already pressed bat vanishes the issue

00:01:51.079 --> 00:01:52.990 
regardless but the reason I think is a
bug<00:01:51.319> is<00:01:51.469> peeling<00:01:51.770> because<00:01:51.979> any<00:01:52.340> the<00:01:52.789> back

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:53.000 
bug is peeling because any the back

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.240 
bug is peeling because any the back
appears<00:01:53.659> and<00:01:53.929> then<00:01:53.959> vanishes<00:01:54.439> and<00:01:54.890> I<00:01:55.009> can't

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:55.250 
appears and then vanishes and I can't

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:59.169 
appears and then vanishes and I can't
cast<00:01:55.459> it<00:01:55.700> here<00:01:55.850> for<00:01:56.750> the<00:01:56.810> duration<00:01:58.030> and<00:01:59.030> also

00:01:59.169 --> 00:01:59.179 
cast it here for the duration and also

00:01:59.179 --> 00:02:06.600 
cast it here for the duration and also
because<00:01:59.329> no<00:01:59.899> one<00:02:00.140> I<00:02:02.289> can<00:02:03.289> castle<00:02:03.770> immediately

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:06.610 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:08.979 

no<00:02:07.610> they<00:02:07.729> can't<00:02:07.969> cast<00:02:08.149> it<00:02:08.390> as<00:02:08.569> you<00:02:08.720> can<00:02:08.869> see

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:08.989 
no they can't cast it as you can see

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:11.620 
no they can't cast it as you can see
there<00:02:09.849> that's<00:02:10.849> why<00:02:11.030> I<00:02:11.060> think<00:02:11.180> it<00:02:11.390> might<00:02:11.480> be<00:02:11.540> a

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:11.630 
there that's why I think it might be a

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:13.750 
there that's why I think it might be a
bug<00:02:11.870> it<00:02:12.110> doesn't<00:02:12.380> hinder<00:02:12.500> but<00:02:13.400> it's<00:02:13.519> very

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760 
bug it doesn't hinder but it's very

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:16.360 
bug it doesn't hinder but it's very
strange<00:02:14.620> I'm<00:02:15.620> not<00:02:15.739> quite<00:02:15.950> sure<00:02:15.980> why<00:02:16.310> it

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.370 
strange I'm not quite sure why it

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:18.610 
strange I'm not quite sure why it
functions<00:02:16.819> that<00:02:17.000> way<00:02:17.150> I<00:02:17.390> mean<00:02:17.810> I<00:02:17.930> send<00:02:18.440> it<00:02:18.530> to

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
functions that way I mean I send it to

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:19.839 
functions that way I mean I send it to
the<00:02:18.709> right<00:02:18.739> people<00:02:19.010> I<00:02:19.220> suppose<00:02:19.250> I<00:02:19.670> try<00:02:19.819> again

00:02:19.839 --> 00:02:19.849 
the right people I suppose I try again

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:21.910 
the right people I suppose I try again
depending<00:02:20.420> on<00:02:20.540> it<00:02:20.690> it<00:02:21.170> could<00:02:21.379> be<00:02:21.500> a<00:02:21.530> gameplay

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:21.920 
depending on it it could be a gameplay

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:23.500 
depending on it it could be a gameplay
decision<00:02:22.250> regardless<00:02:22.640> might<00:02:23.150> have<00:02:23.269> been<00:02:23.390> how

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:23.510 
decision regardless might have been how

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:25.960 
decision regardless might have been how
they<00:02:23.690> get<00:02:23.840> around<00:02:23.930> it<00:02:24.230> but<00:02:24.860> just<00:02:25.459> for<00:02:25.700> the<00:02:25.730> sake

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:25.970 
they get around it but just for the sake

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:29.740 
they get around it but just for the sake
of<00:02:26.030> it<00:02:26.239> might<00:02:26.569> be<00:02:26.900> a<00:02:26.930> bug<00:02:27.370> I'm<00:02:28.370> gonna<00:02:28.720> put<00:02:29.720> this

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750 
of it might be a bug I'm gonna put this

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:31.479 
of it might be a bug I'm gonna put this
