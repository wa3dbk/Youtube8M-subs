kraftwerk<00:00:55.570> yeah<00:00:56.160> it's<00:00:57.160> about<00:00:57.460> it<00:00:57.670> so<00:00:58.360> it's<00:00:58.570> a

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
kraftwerk yeah it's about it so it's a

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.900 
kraftwerk yeah it's about it so it's a
all<00:01:00.190> analog<00:01:00.910> system<00:01:01.410> you<00:01:02.410> have<00:01:02.620> a<00:01:02.650> lamp<00:01:03.550> in<00:01:03.730> it

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:03.910 
all analog system you have a lamp in it

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:07.170 
all analog system you have a lamp in it
with<00:01:04.180> four<00:01:04.480> sensors<00:01:04.989> which<00:01:05.770> do<00:01:06.010> the<00:01:06.190> do<00:01:07.150> the

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:07.180 
with four sensors which do the do the

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:11.940 
with four sensors which do the do the
regular<00:01:07.810> the<00:01:09.480> yeah<00:01:10.480> the<00:01:10.840> range<00:01:11.080> and<00:01:11.380> you<00:01:11.740> can

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:11.950 
regular the yeah the range and you can

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:17.160 
regular the yeah the range and you can
can<00:01:12.310> move<00:01:12.550> all<00:01:12.730> the<00:01:13.440> four<00:01:14.440> you<00:01:14.590> need<00:01:15.870> from<00:01:16.870> left

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:17.170 
can move all the four you need from left

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:20.570 
can move all the four you need from left
to<00:01:17.260> right<00:01:17.380> we<00:01:17.830> have<00:01:18.030> phasing<00:01:19.030> now<00:01:19.270> facing

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
to right we have phasing now facing

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.920 
to right we have phasing now facing
oscillator<00:01:21.580> period<00:01:22.470> this<00:01:23.470> is<00:01:23.650> a<00:01:24.390> fast<00:01:25.390> or<00:01:25.659> slow

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:25.930 
oscillator period this is a fast or slow

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:30.780 
oscillator period this is a fast or slow
the<00:01:26.260> feedback<00:01:27.190> itself<00:01:27.700> the<00:01:28.480> effect<00:01:29.790> itself

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:30.790 
the feedback itself the effect itself

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:33.180 
the feedback itself the effect itself
you<00:01:31.030> know<00:01:31.090> I<00:01:31.420> can<00:01:31.720> control<00:01:32.200> you<00:01:32.320> a<00:01:32.650> few

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:33.190 
you know I can control you a few

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:36.160 
you know I can control you a few
different<00:01:33.310> flavors

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:36.170 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:39.550 

maybe<00:01:37.220> nofx

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:39.560 
maybe nofx

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:48.069 
maybe nofx
Oh<00:01:40.479> much<00:01:41.479> effect<00:01:41.990> and<00:01:42.229> noise<00:01:46.450> so<00:01:47.450> you<00:01:47.509> can<00:01:47.750> you

00:01:48.069 --> 00:01:48.079 
Oh much effect and noise so you can you

00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:51.609 
Oh much effect and noise so you can you
can<00:01:48.259> use<00:01:48.439> it<00:01:48.470> also<00:01:48.979> as<00:01:49.159> like<00:01:49.850> a<00:01:49.880> chorus<00:01:50.619> it's

00:01:51.609 --> 00:01:51.619 
can use it also as like a chorus it's

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:59.279 
can use it also as like a chorus it's
very<00:01:52.009> fine<00:01:53.200> uuuu<00:01:54.200> uuuu<00:01:55.240> uuuu<00:01:56.380> uuuu<00:01:57.380> uuuu<00:01:58.250> uuuu

uuuu uuuu uuuu so this face is very fine
you<00:02:03.649> can<00:02:03.799> use<00:02:03.979> it<00:02:04.159> in<00:02:04.280> a<00:02:04.399> studio<00:02:05.000> environment

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:05.270 
you can use it in a studio environment

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:07.690 
you can use it in a studio environment
what<00:02:06.049> sort<00:02:06.320> of<00:02:06.409> connections<00:02:07.070> do<00:02:07.220> we<00:02:07.340> have<00:02:07.520> on

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:07.700 
what sort of connections do we have on

what sort of connections do we have on
the<00:02:07.820> top<00:02:08.030> panel<00:02:08.239> okay<00:02:08.780> it's<00:02:08.899> all<00:02:09.019> stereo<00:02:09.530> left

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:10.160 
the top panel okay it's all stereo left

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:16.390 
the top panel okay it's all stereo left
right<00:02:10.989> you<00:02:11.989> have<00:02:12.140> an<00:02:12.290> input<00:02:14.230> power<00:02:15.230> and<00:02:16.130> you've

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.400 
right you have an input power and you've

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.830 
right you have an input power and you've
got<00:02:16.549> to<00:02:17.540> two<00:02:18.110> inputs<00:02:18.440> for<00:02:18.650> expression<00:02:19.220> pedals

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:19.840 
got to two inputs for expression pedals

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.500 
got to two inputs for expression pedals
can<00:02:20.840> all<00:02:20.989> also<00:02:21.560> adjusted<00:02:22.220> over<00:02:23.000> which
