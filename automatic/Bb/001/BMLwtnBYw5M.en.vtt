to find another one just found a 17 min

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:09.750 
to find another one just found a 17 min
ago<00:04:08.650> but<00:04:08.799> it's<00:04:08.919> probably<00:04:09.220> going<00:04:09.340> to<00:04:09.430> struggle

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:09.760 
ago but it's probably going to struggle

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:10.860 
ago but it's probably going to struggle
to<00:04:09.879> get<00:04:10.000> any<00:04:10.150> further<00:04:10.419> than<00:04:10.690> that

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:10.870 
to get any further than that

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:14.069 
to get any further than that
right<00:04:11.139> now<00:04:12.329> so<00:04:13.329> we're<00:04:13.449> just<00:04:13.599> going<00:04:13.780> to<00:04:13.810> stop

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:14.079 
right now so we're just going to stop

00:04:14.079 --> 00:04:16.140 
right now so we're just going to stop
that<00:04:14.260> now<00:04:15.099> to<00:04:15.159> find<00:04:15.459> an<00:04:15.579> optimal<00:04:15.970> solution

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:16.150 
that now to find an optimal solution

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:19.610 
that now to find an optimal solution
just<00:04:16.930> tick<00:04:17.139> the<00:04:17.169> optimal<00:04:17.739> and<00:04:18.609> press<00:04:18.880> GO<00:04:19.120> and

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:19.620 
just tick the optimal and press GO and

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:21.959 
just tick the optimal and press GO and
this<00:04:20.620> will<00:04:20.799> just<00:04:20.889> wait<00:04:21.099> until<00:04:21.459> it<00:04:21.579> finds<00:04:21.820> the

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:21.969 
this will just wait until it finds the

00:04:21.969 --> 00:04:23.830 
this will just wait until it finds the
optimal<00:04:22.479> solution<00:04:22.930> and<00:04:23.139> then

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:23.840 
optimal solution and then

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:29.110 
optimal solution and then
post<00:04:24.080> it<00:04:27.070> so<00:04:28.070> now<00:04:28.220> you<00:04:28.280> can<00:04:28.490> solve<00:04:28.730> the<00:04:28.910> cube

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:29.120 
post it so now you can solve the cube

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:32.500 
post it so now you can solve the cube
state<00:04:29.740> let's<00:04:30.740> find<00:04:31.250> out<00:04:31.400> how<00:04:31.550> to<00:04:31.580> find<00:04:32.000> a<00:04:32.270> list

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:32.510 
state let's find out how to find a list

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:35.050 
state let's find out how to find a list
of<00:04:32.630> algorithms<00:04:33.199> for<00:04:33.590> a<00:04:33.650> for<00:04:34.340> a<00:04:34.370> specific<00:04:34.910> case

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:35.060 
of algorithms for a for a specific case

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:38.290 
of algorithms for a for a specific case
that<00:04:35.330> you<00:04:35.419> want<00:04:36.310> so<00:04:37.310> let's<00:04:37.490> just<00:04:37.699> set<00:04:37.820> up<00:04:37.970> a<00:04:38.120> new

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:38.300 
that you want so let's just set up a new

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:45.969 
that you want so let's just set up a new
poem<00:04:42.520> we<00:04:43.520> have<00:04:43.610> a<00:04:43.639> new<00:04:43.850> part<00:04:44.470> now<00:04:45.470> if<00:04:45.650> you<00:04:45.800> want

00:04:45.969 --> 00:04:45.979 
poem we have a new part now if you want

00:04:45.979 --> 00:04:47.680 
poem we have a new part now if you want
to<00:04:46.040> find<00:04:46.220> an<00:04:46.370> emu<00:04:46.639> pile<00:04:47.000> you<00:04:47.210> probably<00:04:47.389> don't

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:47.690 
to find an emu pile you probably don't

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:49.840 
to find an emu pile you probably don't
want<00:04:47.930> to<00:04:48.139> just<00:04:48.350> find<00:04:48.860> one<00:04:49.190> algorithm<00:04:49.490> like

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:49.850 
want to just find one algorithm like

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:53.110 
want to just find one algorithm like
this<00:04:50.350> you<00:04:51.350> won't<00:04:51.470> have<00:04:51.620> our<00:04:51.740> list<00:04:52.160> so<00:04:52.880> to<00:04:52.940> do

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:53.120 
this you won't have our list so to do

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:55.080 
this you won't have our list so to do
that<00:04:53.150> we<00:04:53.479> can<00:04:53.630> use<00:04:53.660> the<00:04:53.930> right-click<00:04:54.169> function

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:55.090 
that we can use the right-click function

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:58.210 
that we can use the right-click function
and<00:04:56.090> right<00:04:56.270> clicking<00:04:56.510> on<00:04:56.690> the<00:04:56.750> cube<00:04:57.139> gives<00:04:58.010> you

00:04:58.210 --> 00:04:58.220 
and right clicking on the cube gives you

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:02.230 
and right clicking on the cube gives you
blank<00:04:58.520> pieces<00:05:00.160> now<00:05:01.160> by<00:05:01.370> putting<00:05:01.729> a<00:05:02.060> whole

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:02.240 
blank pieces now by putting a whole
