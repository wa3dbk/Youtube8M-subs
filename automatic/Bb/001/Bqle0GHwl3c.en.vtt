00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
more these its padding on the sides here

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.460 
more these its padding on the sides here
that<00:02:32.580> has<00:02:33.180> a<00:02:33.209> little<00:02:33.360> give<00:02:33.690> so<00:02:34.110> that<00:02:34.230> you<00:02:34.349> can

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
that has a little give so that you can

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:37.119 
that has a little give so that you can
push<00:02:34.680> the<00:02:34.799> device<00:02:35.040> in<00:02:35.280> there<00:02:35.459> maybe<00:02:36.120> with<00:02:36.420> a

00:02:37.119 --> 00:02:37.129 
push the device in there maybe with a

00:02:37.129 --> 00:02:41.270 
push the device in there maybe with a
lot<00:02:38.129> of<00:02:38.190> time<00:02:38.519> using<00:02:39.209> this<00:02:39.299> device<00:02:40.280> this

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
lot of time using this device this

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:44.360 
lot of time using this device this
accessory<00:02:42.049> maybe<00:02:43.049> it<00:02:43.290> loosens<00:02:43.680> up<00:02:43.829> maybe<00:02:44.250> it

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
accessory maybe it loosens up maybe it

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:45.979 
accessory maybe it loosens up maybe it
becomes<00:02:44.459> dangerous<00:02:45.030> I<00:02:45.150> don't<00:02:45.299> know<00:02:45.450> but<00:02:45.840> what

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:45.989 
becomes dangerous I don't know but what

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:48.380 
becomes dangerous I don't know but what
I've<00:02:46.079> seen<00:02:46.290> from<00:02:46.470> it<00:02:46.620> so<00:02:46.769> far<00:02:46.980> is<00:02:47.700> very<00:02:47.970> nice<00:02:48.150> it

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
I've seen from it so far is very nice it

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:49.940 
I've seen from it so far is very nice it
doesn't<00:02:48.569> protect<00:02:49.200> the<00:02:49.319> back<00:02:49.470> of<00:02:49.620> the<00:02:49.680> device

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
doesn't protect the back of the device

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:52.910 
doesn't protect the back of the device
at<00:02:50.160> all<00:02:50.280> but<00:02:50.989> back<00:02:51.989> the<00:02:52.170> device<00:02:52.410> is<00:02:52.620> not<00:02:52.769> the

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 
at all but back the device is not the

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:56.509 
at all but back the device is not the
most<00:02:53.069> important<00:02:53.519> part<00:02:54.019> so<00:02:55.019> the<00:02:55.920> one<00:02:56.430> other

00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:56.519 
most important part so the one other

00:02:56.519 --> 00:02:58.490 
most important part so the one other
thing<00:02:56.819> about<00:02:56.940> this<00:02:57.180> keyboard<00:02:57.390> that's<00:02:57.900> nice<00:02:58.109> is

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
thing about this keyboard that's nice is

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:01.580 
thing about this keyboard that's nice is
the<00:02:59.220> fact<00:02:59.250> that<00:02:59.609> it<00:02:59.819> sets<00:03:00.060> up<00:03:00.239> as<00:03:00.420> a<00:03:00.450> dock<00:03:00.750> for

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
the fact that it sets up as a dock for

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:05.390 
the fact that it sets up as a dock for
your<00:03:02.390> for<00:03:03.390> your<00:03:03.450> tablet<00:03:04.019> as<00:03:04.590> you<00:03:04.739> can<00:03:04.890> see<00:03:05.099> here

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
your for your tablet as you can see here

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:12.229 
your for your tablet as you can see here
there's<00:03:05.640> a<00:03:05.700> little<00:03:05.790> groove<00:03:06.180> and<00:03:06.629> then<00:03:11.239> right

00:03:12.229 --> 00:03:12.239 
there's a little groove and then right

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:14.569 
there's a little groove and then right
here<00:03:12.750> there's<00:03:13.560> a<00:03:13.650> little<00:03:13.950> place<00:03:14.250> where<00:03:14.519> it

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:14.579 
here there's a little place where it

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:16.159 
here there's a little place where it
sticks<00:03:14.879> out<00:03:15.120> so<00:03:15.419> it<00:03:15.540> just<00:03:15.569> kind<00:03:15.900> of<00:03:15.959> goes

00:03:16.159 --> 00:03:16.169 
sticks out so it just kind of goes

00:03:16.169 --> 00:03:17.839 
sticks out so it just kind of goes
underneath<00:03:16.620> it<00:03:16.829> and<00:03:16.980> it<00:03:17.370> has<00:03:17.489> a<00:03:17.519> rubber

00:03:17.839 --> 00:03:17.849 
underneath it and it has a rubber

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:20.000 
underneath it and it has a rubber
coating<00:03:18.359> on<00:03:18.480> it<00:03:18.540> so<00:03:18.989> it's<00:03:19.200> not<00:03:19.380> going<00:03:19.680> to

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010 
coating on it so it's not going to

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:23.120 
coating on it so it's not going to
necessarily<00:03:21.019> do<00:03:22.019> anything<00:03:22.049> to<00:03:22.650> mess<00:03:22.950> up<00:03:23.099> your

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:23.130 
necessarily do anything to mess up your

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:24.949 
necessarily do anything to mess up your
device<00:03:23.549> thanks<00:03:23.970> to<00:03:24.030> this<00:03:24.120> rubber<00:03:24.389> coating<00:03:24.810> I

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:24.959 
device thanks to this rubber coating I

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:26.240 
device thanks to this rubber coating I
didn't<00:03:25.739> notice

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
didn't notice

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:28.089 
didn't notice
after<00:03:26.549> using<00:03:26.730> it<00:03:26.970> for<00:03:27.180> the<00:03:27.239> first<00:03:27.450> time<00:03:27.630> or<00:03:27.780> two

00:03:28.089 --> 00:03:28.099 
after using it for the first time or two

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:30.920 
after using it for the first time or two
that<00:03:29.099> it<00:03:29.220> would<00:03:29.340> leave<00:03:29.579> a<00:03:29.609> small<00:03:30.150> black<00:03:30.510> mark

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930 
that it would leave a small black mark

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:33.440 
that it would leave a small black mark
on<00:03:31.169> the<00:03:31.260> back<00:03:32.220> of<00:03:32.400> the<00:03:32.459> device<00:03:32.579> down<00:03:32.940> here<00:03:33.269> but

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:33.450 
on the back of the device down here but

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:34.580 
on the back of the device down here but
that<00:03:33.540> was<00:03:33.630> pretty<00:03:33.810> much<00:03:34.019> just<00:03:34.079> where<00:03:34.500> the

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:34.590 
that was pretty much just where the

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:37.159 
that was pretty much just where the
rubber<00:03:34.799> coating<00:03:35.250> was<00:03:35.400> so<00:03:36.239> maybe<00:03:36.480> after<00:03:36.959> time

00:03:37.159 --> 00:03:37.169 
rubber coating was so maybe after time

00:03:37.169 --> 00:03:38.449 
rubber coating was so maybe after time
that<00:03:37.200> rubber<00:03:37.560> coating<00:03:37.919> starts<00:03:38.190> to<00:03:38.280> wear<00:03:38.400> off

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:38.459 
that rubber coating starts to wear off

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:42.289 
that rubber coating starts to wear off
as<00:03:38.760> well<00:03:39.560> don't<00:03:40.560> have<00:03:40.799> time<00:03:41.069> to<00:03:41.400> put<00:03:41.970> that<00:03:42.150> much

00:03:42.289 --> 00:03:42.299 
as well don't have time to put that much

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:43.909 
as well don't have time to put that much
into<00:03:42.569> it<00:03:42.599> and<00:03:42.810> find<00:03:42.959> out<00:03:43.200> but<00:03:43.530> that's

00:03:43.909 --> 00:03:43.919 
into it and find out but that's

00:03:43.919 --> 00:03:46.720 
into it and find out but that's
something<00:03:44.220> you<00:03:44.250> might<00:03:44.430> want<00:03:44.669> to<00:03:44.700> consider<00:03:45.120> and

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:46.730 
something you might want to consider and

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:53.050 
something you might want to consider and
yeah<00:03:47.730> so<00:03:48.120> when<00:03:48.329> you<00:03:48.419> put<00:03:48.599> this<00:03:48.750> right<00:03:48.930> here<00:03:50.900> and

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:53.060 
yeah so when you put this right here and

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:57.080 
yeah so when you put this right here and
type<00:03:54.060> away<00:03:54.650> as<00:03:55.650> far<00:03:55.980> as<00:03:56.129> the<00:03:56.280> keyboard<00:03:56.639> goes<00:03:56.879> if

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.090 
type away as far as the keyboard goes if

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:59.690 
type away as far as the keyboard goes if
you<00:03:57.180> saw<00:03:57.419> my<00:03:57.660> review<00:03:58.079> of<00:03:58.109> the<00:03:58.700> logitech

you saw my review of the logitech

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:02.390 
you saw my review of the logitech
generic<00:04:00.450> type<00:04:00.840> keyboard<00:04:01.200> for<00:04:01.650> all<00:04:01.829> honeycomb

generic type keyboard for all honeycomb
tablets<00:04:03.019> there<00:04:04.019> were<00:04:04.109> some<00:04:04.290> problems<00:04:04.650> with

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:04.859 
tablets there were some problems with

00:04:04.859 --> 00:04:06.440 
tablets there were some problems with
some<00:04:04.889> of<00:04:05.040> the<00:04:05.190> key<00:04:05.370> presses<00:04:05.849> i<00:04:05.970> haven't

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:06.450 
some of the key presses i haven't

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:07.699 
some of the key presses i haven't
noticed<00:04:06.750> those<00:04:06.959> problems<00:04:07.410> with<00:04:07.560> this

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:07.709 
noticed those problems with this

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:11.990 
noticed those problems with this
keyboard<00:04:08.510> so<00:04:10.160> that's<00:04:11.160> not<00:04:11.310> something<00:04:11.549> really

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:12.000 
keyboard so that's not something really

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.809 
keyboard so that's not something really
be<00:04:12.120> concerned<00:04:12.480> about<00:04:12.660> the<00:04:13.620> keys<00:04:13.889> are<00:04:14.250> tighter

00:04:14.809 --> 00:04:14.819 
be concerned about the keys are tighter

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:16.719 
be concerned about the keys are tighter
together<00:04:15.030> and<00:04:15.480> a<00:04:15.510> little<00:04:15.629> more<00:04:15.900> cramped<00:04:16.349> than

00:04:16.719 --> 00:04:16.729 
together and a little more cramped than

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:20.009 
together and a little more cramped than
I'm<00:04:17.729> used<00:04:17.789> to<00:04:18.150> but

00:04:20.009 --> 00:04:20.019 
I'm used to but

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:23.129 
I'm used to but
obviously<00:04:20.560> space<00:04:20.859> was<00:04:21.100> limited<00:04:21.900> the<00:04:22.900> keys

00:04:23.129 --> 00:04:23.139 
obviously space was limited the keys

00:04:23.139 --> 00:04:25.620 
obviously space was limited the keys
feel<00:04:24.009> pretty<00:04:24.310> good<00:04:24.490> for<00:04:24.789> the<00:04:24.850> most<00:04:25.030> part<00:04:25.360> it

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:25.630 
feel pretty good for the most part it

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:26.999 
feel pretty good for the most part it
takes<00:04:25.840> a<00:04:25.900> little<00:04:26.020> getting<00:04:26.110> used<00:04:26.470> to<00:04:26.650> because

00:04:26.999 --> 00:04:27.009 
takes a little getting used to because

00:04:27.009 --> 00:04:29.340 
takes a little getting used to because
it<00:04:27.370> is<00:04:27.400> a<00:04:27.520> different<00:04:27.940> a<00:04:28.150> little<00:04:28.720> bit<00:04:28.960> different

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:29.350 
it is a different a little bit different

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:30.900 
it is a different a little bit different
than<00:04:29.470> what<00:04:29.680> you're<00:04:29.860> probably<00:04:29.979> accustomed<00:04:30.550> to
