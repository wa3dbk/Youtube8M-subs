step number one you're going to need to
acquire<00:00:25.610> yourself<00:00:26.029> a<00:00:26.210> fixed-gear<00:00:26.599> bicycle

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:30.650 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:33.540 

I<00:00:30.710> think<00:00:31.430> I'm<00:00:31.550> going<00:00:31.699> to<00:00:31.820> use<00:00:31.939> this<00:00:32.090> one<00:00:32.270> today

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:33.550 
I think I'm going to use this one today

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:36.910 
I think I'm going to use this one today
step<00:00:34.550> number<00:00:34.730> two<00:00:35.059> when<00:00:35.930> practicing<00:00:36.559> you

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:36.920 
step number two when practicing you

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:39.400 
step number two when practicing you
should<00:00:37.130> find<00:00:37.340> yourself<00:00:37.520> a<00:00:37.970> nice<00:00:38.210> smooth<00:00:38.900> area

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:39.410 
should find yourself a nice smooth area

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:41.260 
should find yourself a nice smooth area
at<00:00:39.590> a<00:00:39.650> long<00:00:40.010> stretch<00:00:40.430> so<00:00:40.879> you<00:00:40.970> can<00:00:41.090> get<00:00:41.239> a

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:41.270 
at a long stretch so you can get a

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:45.939 
at a long stretch so you can get a
decent<00:00:41.600> run-up<00:00:43.720> step<00:00:44.720> number<00:00:44.900> three<00:00:45.320> you're

00:00:45.939 --> 00:00:45.949 
decent run-up step number three you're

00:00:45.949 --> 00:00:47.710 
decent run-up step number three you're
going<00:00:46.190> to<00:00:46.340> need<00:00:46.489> to<00:00:46.610> position<00:00:47.180> yourself<00:00:47.600> so

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:47.720 
going to need to position yourself so

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:49.450 
going to need to position yourself so
that<00:00:48.080> most<00:00:48.260> of<00:00:48.410> your<00:00:48.530> body<00:00:48.830> weight<00:00:49.040> is<00:00:49.280> on<00:00:49.309> the

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:51.860 
front end of the bike so as you can see

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:54.310 
front end of the bike so as you can see
here<00:00:52.250> I've<00:00:52.370> got<00:00:52.400> my<00:00:52.730> crutch<00:00:53.059> on<00:00:53.330> the<00:00:53.839> handlebar

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:54.320 
here I've got my crutch on the handlebar

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:57.369 
here I've got my crutch on the handlebar
thus<00:00:54.949> leaving<00:00:55.850> my<00:00:56.120> back<00:00:56.420> wheel<00:00:56.629> with<00:00:57.019> less

00:00:57.369 --> 00:00:57.379 
thus leaving my back wheel with less

00:00:57.379 --> 00:00:59.799 
thus leaving my back wheel with less
weight<00:00:57.650> on<00:00:57.920> it<00:00:58.160> so<00:00:58.339> that<00:00:58.640> it<00:00:58.760> is<00:00:58.790> easier<00:00:59.360> for<00:00:59.750> it

00:00:59.799 --> 00:00:59.809 
weight on it so that it is easier for it

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:04.810 
weight on it so that it is easier for it
to<00:00:59.870> skid<00:01:01.930> step<00:01:02.930> number<00:01:03.110> four<00:01:03.559> whilst<00:01:04.369> leaning
