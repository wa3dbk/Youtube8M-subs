00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:13.090
 in the years 2007 and 2008 it came around 

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:15.140
 around the world to violent bread riots 

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:17.300
 the wheat prices in the world market 

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:19.490
 had tripled since 2000 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:21.619
 a topic that lasts long from the headlines 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:22.369
 had disappeared back the 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:24.350
 world food 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:26.300
 but how does that work? 

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:28.910
 world nutrition what are the problems 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:31.550
 and what can be done with that 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:32.989
 system works better worldwide 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:35.390
 food is produced 

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:37.250
 processed transported and consumed 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:40.760
 that will be the seven billion 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:42.590
 earthlings supplied there are about 450 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:44.930
 million small farmers especially in the 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:46.970
 developing countries the strong 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:49.100
 globalized agribusiness has against 

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:50.720
 only a few actors are the four largest 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:54.050
 control cereals and soy traders 

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:56.719
 about 75 of the world small farmers 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:58.460
 industry distributors and consumers 

00:00:56.719 --> 00:00:59.320
 in a complex network with each other 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:01.670
 connected 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:04.009
 some small farmers supply their products 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:05.750
 They often compete with large corporations 

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:08.149
 but also around local and global markets 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:10.970
 or increasingly scarce resources like 

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:12.680
 water or fertile soil the rules 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:14.360
 For these systems are used by the markets 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:17.510
 and international organizations 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:18.560
 as the wto determines there is a whole 

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:21.110
 series of problems 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:22.940
 It was long assumed a departure from 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:24.920
 peasant structures towards 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:26.360
 large-scale cultivation methods and opening 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:28.930
 for the world market , the 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:30.890
 Ensure a more efficient nutritional situation 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:32.540
 but in the long run they lower 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:35.030
 large-scale and chemical intensive 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:36.229
 monocultures the soil quality many 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:38.270
 Small farmers have their arable land 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:38.840
 abandoned and are in the cities 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:40.250
 drawn 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:42.159
 the knowledge of traditional 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:44.299
 farming methods and plant varieties is decreasing 

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:45.740
 These large plantations are always 

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:47.299
 more common by major international 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:49.670
 investors operated 

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:50.720
 They buy or lease large areas 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:52.970
 especially in africa 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:54.350
 this so-called land grabbing concerns 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:57.189
 every year an area of ​​the size 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:58.970
 france the world trade system 

00:01:57.189 --> 00:02:01.189
 penalizes the peasants 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:03.079
 an example the european union 

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:03.820
 subsidizes their agricultural economy 

00:02:03.079 --> 00:02:05.680
 strongly 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:07.240
 The companies can put their products on 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:10.030
 offer the world market very cheap 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:11.650
 should be product standards and others 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:13.330
 Trade barriers protect the other hand 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:15.910
 European market for small farmers 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:17.470
 developing countries emerging economies 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:19.150
 like India or China are developing 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:20.920
 economically also the eating habits 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:21.880
 approaching more and more of those 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:24.310
 industrial countries 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:26.080
 Above all, more meat is eaten in 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:27.160
 China, for example, five times as much as 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:29.620
 1980 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:31.360
 the problem with the production 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:33.130
 a calorie meat must have two to 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:35.560
 fed seven vegetable calories 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:37.690
 will be areas on those earlier 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:39.550
 are now grown 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:41.770
 with lucrative export goods like coffee 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:42.970
 or cotton or it will be ordered 

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:46.390
 grown energy crops 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:48.100
 buy for biosprit investors 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:49.810
 foods on the stock exchanges they 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:51.700
 speculate that the products 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:52.860
 become more expensive and drive the prices 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:55.570
 artificially high 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:57.400
 there are price fluctuations of 

00:02:55.570 --> 00:03:00.220
 small producers poorly caught 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:01.209
 can be and a third of all 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:02.920
 foods produced worldwide 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:05.350
 spoiling during transport and storage 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:06.970
 or she's not good enough for that 

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:09.820
 Consumers in industrialized countries 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:11.280
 they just end up in trash so there is 

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:13.570
 many structural problems 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:15.130
 The framework will be in 

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:17.260
 future probably continue to worsen 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:18.880
 the world population is growing rapidly before 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.049
 especially in the areas the strongest 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:23.739
 affected by food shortages 

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:24.820
 are by 2050 need nine billion 

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:27.730
 people are fed 

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:30.000
 Climate change is reducing capacities 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:32.290
 by erosion drought and devastation 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.459
 in addition to use and the 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:35.950
 building large areas 

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:36.880
 Experts assume that in the 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:38.590
 most developmental and 

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:40.930
 emerging markets return 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:43.510
 There are different approaches of the 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:44.950
 World Food Day is a new one 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:45.820
 green revolution is the income 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:49.390
 multiply 

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:50.440
 the genetic engineering but the previous one 

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:51.519
 Research is less on one 

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:53.769
 improving the nutritional situation 

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:55.690
 aligned in the middle point 

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:57.400
 resistance to herbicides by more 

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:58.340
 use herbicides 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:59.930
 can 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:02.000
 the new go are remaining varieties 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:03.379
 also mostly patented and bring that way 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.349
 dependent on the small farmers 

00:04:03.379 --> 00:04:07.160
 towards the big seed producers 

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:09.590
 other measures are a lot 

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:10.700
 promising access to the 

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:12.200
 global markets and the 

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:13.540
 competitiveness of smallholders 

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:15.769
 need to be improved 

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:17.419
 especially the european union could 

00:04:15.769 --> 00:04:20.540
 This is a change in their agricultural policy 

00:04:17.419 --> 00:04:21.799
 it has to be more important to you 

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:22.370
 development of rural areas 

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:24.770
 become 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:26.510
 these include the promotion of 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:28.160
 small farmers in the distribution of soil 

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:30.650
 Right investments in the 

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:32.210
 infrastructure in education and the 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:35.810
 communicating knowledge to the sustainable 

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:37.820
 farming methods every single consumer 

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:39.169
 has the possibility with his behavior 

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:41.479
 to make a difference 

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:42.770
 for example, by giving less meat 

00:04:41.479 --> 00:04:45.440
 Eats and not so many foods 

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:46.490
 throw it away is high time 

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:48.830
 change course 

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:51.289
 a decentralized fair and sustainable 

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:53.389
 Developing the agricultural sector is important 

00:04:51.289 --> 00:04:55.220
 only then can a population of nine 

00:04:53.389 --> 00:04:57.520
 billion people are fed in the long term 

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:57.520
 become
