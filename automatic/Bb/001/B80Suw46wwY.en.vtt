00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:15.380 
from Disneyland and you can see it's
it's<00:02:14.250> kind<00:02:14.519> of<00:02:14.549> hard<00:02:14.700> to<00:02:14.760> see<00:02:14.939> in<00:02:15.060> this<00:02:15.180> video

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
it's kind of hard to see in this video

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:18.199 
it's kind of hard to see in this video
but<00:02:15.540> this<00:02:15.840> is<00:02:15.959> actually<00:02:16.079> lenticular<00:02:16.829> and<00:02:17.209> it's

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:18.209 
but this is actually lenticular and it's

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:20.390 
but this is actually lenticular and it's
orange<00:02:18.599> instead<00:02:19.019> of<00:02:19.109> clear<00:02:19.439> so<00:02:20.129> it's<00:02:20.219> a<00:02:20.250> little

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
orange instead of clear so it's a little

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:21.800 
orange instead of clear so it's a little
bit<00:02:20.549> different<00:02:20.730> from<00:02:21.090> some<00:02:21.510> of<00:02:21.569> the<00:02:21.659> stuff

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
bit different from some of the stuff

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:23.360 
bit different from some of the stuff
that<00:02:21.840> they<00:02:22.049> were<00:02:22.109> previewing<00:02:22.620> before<00:02:23.099> and

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
that they were previewing before and

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:27.349 
that they were previewing before and
then<00:02:24.329> this<00:02:24.569> is<00:02:24.719> the<00:02:24.870> actual<00:02:25.019> world<00:02:26.209> for<00:02:27.209> the

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:27.359 
then this is the actual world for the

00:02:27.359 --> 00:02:34.069

this<00:02:34.200> one's<00:02:34.469> kind<00:02:34.709> of<00:02:34.799> different<00:02:35.250> because

00:02:35.869 --> 00:02:35.879 
this one's kind of different because

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:38.720
