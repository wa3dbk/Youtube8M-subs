 Bogomazov 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:08.700
 your personal rejuvenation trainer and 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:11.190
 correction of appearance and in today's 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:13.530
 video I'll show you one simple but 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.929
 A very effective way to cleanse your face 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.560
 home conditions 

00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:21.330
 organically naturally without any there 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:23.580
 chemical additives means we will 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:26.279
 use this is called and owls 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:29.160
 washing my rice flour but 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.869
 you can buy ordinary flour in ordinary 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:34.200
 there is no shop here 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:37.950
 labor requirements should be normal 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:42.079
 flour and you take literally this 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:47.250
 pour a little spoon in 

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:52.350
 palm and add a little bit like that 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:55.620
 boiled some water here well about half 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:58.949
 less time we mix it all up in your 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:05.150
 wife darling before education such here 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:07.619
 how would gruel so yes not very thick 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:09.479
 there you are 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:12.030
 something is spilled that wakes up nothing 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:15.960
 scary if you do n't do it over 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.560
 the sink is where the face will need later 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.619
 wash 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:22.350
 here and here turned out such a palm 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:29.579
 see such a mess here we are now her 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:34.400
 we put neatly on all face on all 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:36.900
 parts like this tax applied to the cheeks 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:40.530
 the area around the eyes we naturally do not 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:43.740
 touch as usual you will feel 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:47.909
 such small as there are parts yes 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:49.880
 they say so the effect of peeling performs 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:54.600
 that is, such as 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:56.050
 very so gentle scrub and nice 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.680
 it smells 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:02:05.920
 flour products so you 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:08.530
 apply to all areas around the neck too 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:11.160
 possible because six suffers more 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:14.680
 all that lack of attention 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:16.600
 because face and every day we moisten 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:19.780
 there it is cleared such other 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:24.190
 draws forget here so you 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:29.290
 Well, literally a little bit is needed 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:34.510
 hold maybe a moment after 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:37.360
 This is washed off under running water 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:42.400
 Well there are at odd unless you're there at 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:46.090
 you water and sucks this is not why i 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:49.020
 I will glow with plain water and come back 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:49.020
 thirty. 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:05.760
 anybody kept up 

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:13.510
 herself 

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:42.760
 well that's what i washed off in order to 

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:45.670
 wipe your face better use 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:50.220
 disposable paper towels just 

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:52.870
 squander if you like to use 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:57.280
 ordinary towel and terry there 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:59.319
 or some note another fact 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:04.600
 simple thing if you will wipe 

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:07.180
 face from top to bottom like this then you will 

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:09.880
 form from deepen nasolabial 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:14.110
 folds if you want to wipe something 

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:15.550
 wipe from the bottom up and better that's how i 

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:20.650
 just blot 

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:23.050
 paper towel dry and all on 

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:24.640
 such a cleaner face after a few 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:29.800
 minutes you can apply some 

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:31.240
 day cream for example and makeup is 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:34.630
 rice wash 

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:37.389
 need to do every week you know that 

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:40.390
 that every week you need to do deep 

00:04:37.389 --> 00:04:41.530
 facial cleansing and you're just for 

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:44.200
 such purification 

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:46.990
 not everyday but weekly you 

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:50.560
 can use plain rice flour 

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:53.320
 it's very cheap and very effective here 

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:56.530
 such is the way of purification I suggest 

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:59.530

00:04:56.530 --> 00:05:02.110
