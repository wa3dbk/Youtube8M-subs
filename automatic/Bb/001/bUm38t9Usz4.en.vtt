00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:16.910
 and 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:38.170
 what 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:41.079
 do not need these two easy and parents 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:42.879
 because absolutely nothing things do not 

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:45.720
 you are going to apply with the needle of 

00:00:42.879 --> 00:00:45.720
 glue 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.850
 Well, these are these 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:55.750
 well I did many 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:58.770
 and these who have like this little 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:58.770
 as a rule 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:09.140
 with a shirt and a normal shirt 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:11.000
 median of this size but that is to say that 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:12.860
 it's something else after you come to these 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.979
 pieces and bigger ones that occupy 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:20.180
 a meter and then I'm on this little bit 

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:22.120
 first to me these fabrics a pencil 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:24.640
 A pen 

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:27.460
 and let's start sponging what's coming 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:29.200
 being the padding for the cushion I had 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:31.150
 that he is old then 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:33.550
 people needed to sponge a little 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:36.330
 but if you have a new one, then you do not 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:36.330
 it is very necessary 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:42.320
 after starting using a 

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:44.570
 piece of cloth those bits of cloth 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:46.430
 they can be things like t-shirts or pieces 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:49.370
 of fabric and in this case I'm using a 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:52.210
 T-shirt that is easier to use than 

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:53.950
 already comes with kitchen 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:56.409
 then they come with AIDS because they are going to 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:59.560
 it's easier to do it right now we're 

00:01:56.409 --> 00:02:02.590
 stretching and we will proceed to cut the 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:05.870
 axel axilla for more than dating and that 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:07.610
 is incised is in case of a t-shirt 

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:11.240
 what we are going to try is more or less 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:13.070
 of a degree not so perfect because as 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:15.590
 it's the shirt because it's not going to be 

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:17.930
 as very perfect but that's what 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:21.920
 let's try and we are shortening the 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:24.590
 distances and trying more or less not 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:27.560
 it is very necessary that you go very very very 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:30.910
 right because let's see 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:32.740
 the little bit 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:35.610
 in short is that you like your position well 

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:35.610
 that you like 

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:44.740
 then we're going to flip it over and we're going to 

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:47.990
 mark 5 centimeters on each side 500 

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:52.870
 millimeters wide 

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:52.870
 and 5 centimeters long 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:03.690
 we are going to stop that they believe us more parejito 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:06.780
 that can join the 5 centimeters 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:09.990
 5 centimeters Franco our strips 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:12.960
 to sew to put together we are going to 

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:19.040
 cut them out and we're going to do it for the 

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:19.040
 four sides and here something 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:27.840
 something like that more or less we have the 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:27.840
 four sides 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:39.040
 I think we have a good little cortadito 

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:42.069
 let's put on a flat surface 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:46.599
 we throw them a little bit and let's start 

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:50.740
 to cut strips of the tip until the 

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:52.720
 brand up only open in this way 

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:56.460
 this is so that you will not be left 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:58.690
 like with a hole and right in the middle 

00:03:56.460 --> 00:04:02.410
 you have to do it you have to take the 

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:04.570
 two parts and cut it so it does not matter that 

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:07.580
 you are uneven this is the utility 

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:11.380
 the most beautiful effect 

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:11.380
 Well, we 're just going to flip it 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:20.959
 we pair again all right 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:23.690
 we put on the floor or something flat and 

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:27.590
 we started making the monitos are 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:31.820
 simple ways as it is called rare 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:34.570
 a bow is very valued that is very 

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:39.920
 easy and they are only new singles 

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:42.370
 you just have to go do it 

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:43.810
 leave them a band-aid 

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:47.470
 ah 

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:50.080
 and we return to overpower and return to jara and 

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:53.020
 that's all you're going to do 

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:54.440
 and since you have 24 degrees attached well not 

00:04:53.020 --> 00:05:00.360
 more revenues 

00:04:54.440 --> 00:05:03.080
 a traca always and we 're going to 

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:03.080
 start filling 

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:08.750
 until you like your shape and 

00:05:06.169 --> 00:05:11.439
 then you're just going to keep tying and 

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:11.439
 ready 

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:16.870
 and I hope that you 

00:05:13.639 --> 00:05:16.870
 it is very easy 

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:35.500
 from 2 

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:37.560
 and we say that is the challenge of chile 

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:37.560
 habanero 

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:41.940
 I did not do it the truth is that I am very 

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:43.890
 magic but 

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:46.430
 I hope and like this one too and that 

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:46.430
 subscribe 

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000
 ah
