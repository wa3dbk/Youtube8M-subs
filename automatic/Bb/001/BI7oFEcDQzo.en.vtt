00:00:11.049 --> 00:00:14.169 

okay<00:00:12.049> another<00:00:12.410> alternator<00:00:13.339> modification

00:00:14.169 --> 00:00:14.179 
okay another alternator modification

00:00:14.179 --> 00:00:18.190 
okay another alternator modification
here<00:00:15.550> what<00:00:16.550> I<00:00:16.580> did<00:00:16.939> is<00:00:17.090> my<00:00:17.270> voltage<00:00:17.689> regulator

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:18.200 
here what I did is my voltage regulator

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:20.859 
here what I did is my voltage regulator
in<00:00:18.380> here<00:00:18.650> was<00:00:19.310> starting<00:00:19.820> to<00:00:19.910> go<00:00:20.060> on<00:00:20.240> me<00:00:20.419> might

00:00:20.859 --> 00:00:20.869 
in here was starting to go on me might

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:24.970 
in here was starting to go on me might
notice<00:00:21.140> my<00:00:21.289> voltage<00:00:21.740> on<00:00:22.210> the<00:00:23.210> meter<00:00:24.020> here<00:00:24.380> was

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:24.980 
notice my voltage on the meter here was

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:27.159 
notice my voltage on the meter here was
kind<00:00:25.250> of<00:00:25.340> flickering<00:00:25.880> like<00:00:26.000> 15<00:00:26.480> and<00:00:26.689> a<00:00:26.719> half<00:00:26.750> I

00:00:27.159 --> 00:00:27.169 
kind of flickering like 15 and a half I

00:00:27.169 --> 00:00:29.740 
kind of flickering like 15 and a half I
was<00:00:27.259> even<00:00:27.500> going<00:00:27.680> to<00:00:27.919> the<00:00:28.009> red<00:00:28.219> 16<00:00:28.790> I've<00:00:29.509> had

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:29.750 
was even going to the red 16 I've had

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:31.359 
was even going to the red 16 I've had
this<00:00:29.930> for<00:00:30.140> like<00:00:30.290> two<00:00:30.590> years<00:00:30.619> ready<00:00:31.070> I<00:00:31.099> use<00:00:31.279> the

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:31.369 
this for like two years ready I use the

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:35.319 
this for like two years ready I use the
Machine<00:00:31.669> a<00:00:31.700> lot<00:00:31.969> and<00:00:33.340> the<00:00:34.340> regulator<00:00:35.120> that

00:00:35.319 --> 00:00:35.329 
Machine a lot and the regulator that

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:37.779 
Machine a lot and the regulator that
goes<00:00:35.510> in<00:00:35.750> there<00:00:35.930> for<00:00:36.200> the<00:00:36.289> 10s<00:00:36.680> I<00:00:36.890> and<00:00:37.129> a<00:00:37.190> 12s<00:00:37.579> I

00:00:37.779 --> 00:00:37.789 
goes in there for the 10s I and a 12s I

00:00:37.789 --> 00:00:41.410 
goes in there for the 10s I and a 12s I
it's<00:00:38.660> a<00:00:38.809> little<00:00:38.840> small<00:00:40.270> it's<00:00:41.270> a<00:00:41.390> small

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:41.420 
it's a little small it's a small

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:43.389 
it's a little small it's a small
regulator<00:00:42.109> like<00:00:42.199> this<00:00:42.469> with<00:00:42.620> two<00:00:42.769> blades<00:00:43.129> and

00:00:43.389 --> 00:00:43.399 
regulator like this with two blades and

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:45.549 
regulator like this with two blades and
I'll<00:00:44.030> show<00:00:44.239> you<00:00:44.300> the<00:00:44.510> images<00:00:45.079> in<00:00:45.199> a<00:00:45.289> minute

00:00:45.549 --> 00:00:45.559 
I'll show you the images in a minute

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:48.340 
I'll show you the images in a minute
what<00:00:45.649> it<00:00:45.739> looks<00:00:45.890> like<00:00:46.039> how<00:00:46.969> I<00:00:46.999> modified<00:00:47.600> it<00:00:47.629> but

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:48.350 
what it looks like how I modified it but

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:50.500 
what it looks like how I modified it but
even<00:00:49.339> though<00:00:49.460> it<00:00:49.550> was<00:00:49.670> in<00:00:49.850> here<00:00:50.059> was<00:00:50.149> easy<00:00:50.359> to

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:50.510 
even though it was in here was easy to

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:53.529 
even though it was in here was easy to
change<00:00:50.780> I<00:00:51.140> figured<00:00:52.010> I'd<00:00:52.940> rather<00:00:53.149> have<00:00:53.420> an

00:00:53.529 --> 00:00:53.539 
change I figured I'd rather have an

00:00:53.539 --> 00:00:54.430 
change I figured I'd rather have an
external<00:00:53.929> one

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:54.440 
external one

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:57.069 
external one
I<00:00:54.469> found<00:00:55.219> this<00:00:55.429> circuit<00:00:55.879> online<00:00:56.239> it's<00:00:56.960> really

00:00:57.069 --> 00:00:57.079 
I found this circuit online it's really

00:00:57.079 --> 00:00:59.139 
I found this circuit online it's really
good<00:00:57.589> just<00:00:57.859> I<00:00:57.920> get<00:00:58.100> a<00:00:58.129> good<00:00:58.309> shot<00:00:58.640> of<00:00:58.670> it<00:00:58.879> right

00:00:59.139 --> 00:00:59.149 
good just I get a good shot of it right

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:02.649 
good just I get a good shot of it right
there<00:00:59.329> right<00:00:59.769> that's<00:01:00.769> a<00:01:00.949> TI<00:01:01.389> p12<00:01:02.389> one

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:02.659 
there right that's a TI p12 one

00:01:02.659 --> 00:01:06.490 
there right that's a TI p12 one
transistor<00:01:03.519> there's<00:01:04.519> another<00:01:05.000> two<00:01:05.330> n3<00:01:05.780> 904<00:01:06.380> in

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:06.500 
transistor there's another two n3 904 in

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:08.800 
transistor there's another two n3 904 in
there<00:01:06.710> a<00:01:07.400> couple<00:01:07.940> of<00:01:08.000> capacitors<00:01:08.600> for

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:08.810 
there a couple of capacitors for

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:11.530 
there a couple of capacitors for
smoothing<00:01:09.110> out<00:01:09.350> ripples<00:01:09.950> and<00:01:10.330> there's<00:01:11.330> one

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:11.540 
smoothing out ripples and there's one

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:15.420 
smoothing out ripples and there's one
two<00:01:11.570> three<00:01:11.810> four<00:01:13.150> resistors<00:01:14.150> I<00:01:14.390> didn't<00:01:15.140> have<00:01:15.290> a

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:15.430 
two three four resistors I didn't have a

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:19.810 
two three four resistors I didn't have a
900<00:01:16.430> ohm<00:01:16.580> which<00:01:16.940> I<00:01:17.120> needed<00:01:17.690> so<00:01:18.410> I<00:01:18.440> use<00:01:18.620> the<00:01:18.820> 1012

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:19.820 
900 ohm which I needed so I use the 1012

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:22.690 
900 ohm which I needed so I use the 1012
that<00:01:20.510> gave<00:01:20.660> me<00:01:20.750> 920<00:01:21.320> something<00:01:21.710> there's<00:01:22.550> a

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:22.700 
that gave me 920 something there's a

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:27.240 
that gave me 920 something there's a
diode<00:01:23.030> of<00:01:23.360> 400<00:01:23.960> six<00:01:24.770> and<00:01:25.270> there's<00:01:26.270> a<00:01:26.330> Zener<00:01:26.660> in

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:27.250 
diode of 400 six and there's a Zener in

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:30.310 
diode of 400 six and there's a Zener in
there<00:01:28.250> I<00:01:28.280> think<00:01:28.490> that's<00:01:28.730> around<00:01:29.150> twelve<00:01:29.990> point

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:30.320 
there I think that's around twelve point

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:33.370 
there I think that's around twelve point
seven<00:01:30.560> and<00:01:30.800> 13<00:01:31.280> and<00:01:31.900> you<00:01:32.900> definitely<00:01:33.260> need

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:33.380 
seven and 13 and you definitely need

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:35.350 
seven and 13 and you definitely need
this<00:01:33.500> heatsink<00:01:33.950> it<00:01:34.160> puts<00:01:34.790> out<00:01:34.940> a<00:01:34.970> good<00:01:35.180> amount

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:35.360 
this heatsink it puts out a good amount

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:36.970 
this heatsink it puts out a good amount
of<00:01:35.450> heat<00:01:35.600> with<00:01:35.870> this<00:01:36.050> it's<00:01:36.230> fine<00:01:36.410> if<00:01:36.710> you<00:01:36.830> don't

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:36.980 
of heat with this it's fine if you don't

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:40.630 
of heat with this it's fine if you don't
put<00:01:37.100> that<00:01:37.280> forget<00:01:37.610> about<00:01:37.640> it<00:01:38.710> but<00:01:39.710> now<00:01:39.950> the

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:40.640 
put that forget about it but now the

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:42.430 
put that forget about it but now the
beauty<00:01:41.060> of<00:01:41.090> this<00:01:41.330> new<00:01:41.510> regulator<00:01:41.960> is<00:01:42.230> if

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:42.440 
beauty of this new regulator is if

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:44.170 
beauty of this new regulator is if
anything<00:01:42.890> goes<00:01:43.010> wrong<00:01:43.130> I<00:01:43.550> have<00:01:43.730> all<00:01:43.880> the<00:01:44.000> parts

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:44.180 
anything goes wrong I have all the parts

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:45.670 
anything goes wrong I have all the parts
to<00:01:44.420> fix<00:01:44.450> it<00:01:44.750> right<00:01:44.900> here<00:01:45.140> I<00:01:45.290> don't<00:01:45.380> the<00:01:45.560> worry

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:45.680 
to fix it right here I don't the worry

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:48.149 
to fix it right here I don't the worry
about<00:01:45.740> running<00:01:45.950> out<00:01:46.160> and<00:01:46.310> buying<00:01:46.370> a<00:01:46.730> new<00:01:46.880> one

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:48.159 
about running out and buying a new one

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:52.200 
about running out and buying a new one
which<00:01:48.549> could<00:01:48.759> be<00:01:48.850> $25<00:01:49.840> or<00:01:50.110> more<00:01:50.140> and<00:01:50.939> if<00:01:51.939> take

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:52.210 
which could be $25 or more and if take

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:53.600 
which could be $25 or more and if take
the<00:01:52.299> whole<00:01:52.450> thing<00:01:52.479> apart<00:01:52.659> here<00:01:53.409> I<00:01:53.530> just

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
the whole thing apart here I just

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.620 
the whole thing apart here I just
decided<00:01:54.610> the<00:01:54.759> component<00:01:55.270> which<00:01:55.360> will<00:01:55.479> likely

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:55.630 
decided the component which will likely

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:58.620 
decided the component which will likely
be<00:01:55.840> just<00:01:56.200> this<00:01:56.350> transistor<00:01:56.799> or<00:01:57.130> a<00:01:57.270> bad<00:01:58.270> zener

00:01:58.620 --> 00:01:58.630 
be just this transistor or a bad zener

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:00.719 
be just this transistor or a bad zener
and<00:01:58.990> just<00:01:59.770> solder<00:02:00.009> them<00:02:00.159> back<00:02:00.340> in<00:02:00.520> and<00:02:00.640> I'm

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:00.729 
and just solder them back in and I'm

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:05.039 
and just solder them back in and I'm
done<00:02:00.960> so<00:02:01.960> it's<00:02:02.110> much<00:02:02.380> easier<00:02:02.530> to<00:02:02.860> fix<00:02:03.250> as<00:02:04.049> less

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:05.049 
done so it's much easier to fix as less

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:07.020 
done so it's much easier to fix as less
parts<00:02:05.470> on<00:02:05.590> the<00:02:05.710> inside<00:02:06.039> to<00:02:06.250> deal<00:02:06.399> with<00:02:06.610> now<00:02:06.789> all

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:07.030 
parts on the inside to deal with now all

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:09.660 
parts on the inside to deal with now all
they<00:02:07.270> have<00:02:07.299> is<00:02:07.569> the<00:02:07.689> brushes<00:02:08.110> with<00:02:09.069> the<00:02:09.099> diode

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:09.670 
they have is the brushes with the diode

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:12.720

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:18.370 
eight which is perfect so there's a lot

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:21.949 
eight which is perfect so there's a lot
of<00:03:18.400> uses<00:03:18.639> for<00:03:18.940> this<00:03:19.769> basically<00:03:20.769> what<00:03:20.950> I<00:03:20.980> did

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:21.959 
of uses for this basically what I did

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:25.470 
of uses for this basically what I did
you<00:03:22.959> need<00:03:23.139> one<00:03:23.319> wire<00:03:23.560> from<00:03:23.859> the<00:03:23.950> plus

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:25.480 
you need one wire from the plus

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:27.990 
you need one wire from the plus
you<00:03:26.050> need<00:03:26.260> these<00:03:26.650> two<00:03:26.890> wires<00:03:27.130> I<00:03:27.430> gutted<00:03:27.819> the

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:28.000 
you need these two wires I gutted the

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.699 
you need these two wires I gutted the
regulator<00:03:28.480> that<00:03:28.540> was<00:03:28.750> in<00:03:28.870> there<00:03:29.020> and<00:03:29.170> I<00:03:29.530> just

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:29.709 
regulator that was in there and I just

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:32.100 
regulator that was in there and I just
used<00:03:29.920> it<00:03:30.099> as<00:03:30.250> a<00:03:30.280> feed<00:03:30.700> through<00:03:30.940> point<00:03:31.270> and<00:03:31.480> I

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:32.110 
used it as a feed through point and I

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:33.900 
used it as a feed through point and I
kept<00:03:32.410> it<00:03:32.530> in<00:03:32.650> place<00:03:32.950> this<00:03:33.340> way<00:03:33.520> the<00:03:33.730> brush

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:33.910 
kept it in place this way the brush

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:35.760 
kept it in place this way the brush
holder<00:03:34.330> and<00:03:34.420> everything<00:03:34.690> stays<00:03:34.900> where<00:03:35.500> it<00:03:35.590> was

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:35.770 
holder and everything stays where it was

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:38.460 
holder and everything stays where it was
i<00:03:36.010> gutted<00:03:36.849> it<00:03:37.030> out<00:03:37.120> and<00:03:37.360> each<00:03:37.660> one<00:03:37.930> of<00:03:38.050> these<00:03:38.140> is

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:38.470 
i gutted it out and each one of these is

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:41.400 
i gutted it out and each one of these is
a<00:03:38.500> line<00:03:38.950> coming<00:03:39.730> from<00:03:39.880> the<00:03:40.120> rotor<00:03:40.480> this<00:03:41.080> is<00:03:41.200> one

trio wire coming out you got two brushes
one<00:03:59.290> for<00:03:59.530> each<00:03:59.650> on<00:03:59.830> the<00:03:59.920> rotor<00:04:00.130> and<00:04:00.370> then<00:04:01.000> you

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:01.090 
one for each on the rotor and then you

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:03.420 
one for each on the rotor and then you
have<00:04:01.209> a<00:04:01.239> neutral<00:04:01.450> and<00:04:01.840> it<00:04:02.800> all<00:04:02.950> goes<00:04:03.130> to<00:04:03.340> this

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:03.430 
have a neutral and it all goes to this

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:09.730 
have a neutral and it all goes to this
circuit

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:09.740 

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:12.010 

okay<00:04:10.670> I<00:04:10.700> want<00:04:11.060> to<00:04:11.120> get<00:04:11.270> rid<00:04:11.420> of<00:04:11.450> this<00:04:11.630> voltage

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:12.020 
okay I want to get rid of this voltage

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:15.160 
okay I want to get rid of this voltage
regulator<00:04:12.500> and<00:04:12.770> I'm<00:04:13.670> going<00:04:13.790> to<00:04:13.880> mount<00:04:14.140> my<00:04:15.140> own

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:15.170 
regulator and I'm going to mount my own

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:17.650 
regulator and I'm going to mount my own
voltage<00:04:15.740> regulator<00:04:16.370> on<00:04:16.610> the<00:04:16.760> outside<00:04:17.390> of<00:04:17.570> the

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:17.660 
voltage regulator on the outside of the

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:21.190 
voltage regulator on the outside of the
alternator<00:04:19.000> and<00:04:20.000> what<00:04:20.270> I<00:04:20.300> did<00:04:20.540> is<00:04:20.660> I<00:04:20.750> just<00:04:20.810> cut

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:21.200 
alternator and what I did is I just cut

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:23.280 
alternator and what I did is I just cut
all<00:04:21.410> the<00:04:21.590> circuitry<00:04:22.310> away<00:04:22.610> from<00:04:22.820> the<00:04:22.910> post

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:23.290 
all the circuitry away from the post

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:26.050 
all the circuitry away from the post
this<00:04:24.290> one<00:04:24.500> here<00:04:24.830> is<00:04:24.950> the<00:04:25.160> diode<00:04:25.580> tree<00:04:25.940> or

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:26.060 
this one here is the diode tree or

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:29.380 
this one here is the diode tree or
connects<00:04:27.310> this<00:04:28.310> one<00:04:28.520> here<00:04:28.730> if<00:04:28.820> goes<00:04:29.060> to<00:04:29.270> the

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:29.390 
connects this one here if goes to the

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:32.170 
connects this one here if goes to the
field<00:04:29.630> on<00:04:29.960> the<00:04:30.860> rotor<00:04:31.070> and<00:04:31.370> this<00:04:31.700> one<00:04:31.910> here<00:04:32.120> is

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:32.180 
field on the rotor and this one here is

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:35.230 
field on the rotor and this one here is
the<00:04:32.210> ground<00:04:32.570> so<00:04:33.530> what<00:04:33.650> I<00:04:33.680> did<00:04:33.800> is<00:04:34.160> I<00:04:34.370> took<00:04:34.430> this

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:35.240 
the ground so what I did is I took this

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:37.810 
the ground so what I did is I took this
wire<00:04:35.510> and<00:04:35.810> I<00:04:35.900> bypassed<00:04:36.470> it<00:04:36.710> so<00:04:37.400> I<00:04:37.430> could<00:04:37.640> have

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:37.820 
wire and I bypassed it so I could have

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:40.390 
wire and I bypassed it so I could have
this<00:04:38.120> connection<00:04:38.600> right<00:04:38.750> here<00:04:39.260> that's<00:04:40.160> going

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:40.400 
this connection right here that's going

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:42.250 
this connection right here that's going
to<00:04:40.460> be<00:04:40.610> the<00:04:40.760> field<00:04:41.060> my<00:04:41.630> circuit<00:04:41.990> is<00:04:42.050> going<00:04:42.140> to

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:42.260 
to be the field my circuit is going to

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:44.770 
to be the field my circuit is going to
connect<00:04:42.530> that's<00:04:42.890> the<00:04:43.010> field<00:04:43.280> and<00:04:43.570> this<00:04:44.570> one

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:44.780 
connect that's the field and this one

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:46.480 
connect that's the field and this one
here<00:04:45.050> is<00:04:45.140> still<00:04:45.260> the<00:04:45.560> plus<00:04:45.830> for<00:04:46.130> the<00:04:46.250> diode

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:46.490 
here is still the plus for the diode

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:50.140 
here is still the plus for the diode
trio<00:04:46.910> and<00:04:47.320> this<00:04:48.320> post<00:04:48.590> here<00:04:48.890> was<00:04:49.040> ground<00:04:49.370> I<00:04:49.640> can

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:50.150 
trio and this post here was ground I can

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:51.700 
trio and this post here was ground I can
connect<00:04:50.480> the<00:04:50.570> ground<00:04:50.840> wire<00:04:50.960> anywhere<00:04:51.500> on<00:04:51.620> the

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:51.710 
connect the ground wire anywhere on the

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:53.500 
connect the ground wire anywhere on the
outside<00:04:52.040> of<00:04:52.130> the<00:04:52.190> alternator<00:04:52.550> so<00:04:53.210> that's<00:04:53.360> how

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:53.510 
outside of the alternator so that's how

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:54.240 
outside of the alternator so that's how
you<00:04:53.570> do<00:04:53.750> it

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:54.250 
you do it

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:58.660 
you do it
bypass<00:04:55.250> straight<00:04:55.490> across<00:04:57.220> all<00:04:58.220> right<00:04:58.400> this<00:04:58.610> is

00:04:58.660 --> 00:04:58.670 
bypass straight across all right this is

00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:02.890 
bypass straight across all right this is
how<00:04:58.760> I<00:04:58.790> mounted<00:04:59.240> it<00:04:59.380> wires<00:05:00.380> coming<00:05:00.710> out<00:05:01.900> all

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:02.900 
how I mounted it wires coming out all

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:06.820 
how I mounted it wires coming out all
right<00:05:03.250> is<00:05:04.250> the<00:05:04.490> board<00:05:05.110> transistor<00:05:06.110> a<00:05:06.260> little

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:06.830 
right is the board transistor a little

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:10.000 
right is the board transistor a little
bit<00:05:06.920> of<00:05:07.040> the<00:05:07.190> thermal<00:05:07.610> compound<00:05:08.710> now<00:05:09.710> the<00:05:09.770> heat

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:10.010 
bit of the thermal compound now the heat

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:12.510 
bit of the thermal compound now the heat
is<00:05:10.040> pretty<00:05:10.400> solid<00:05:10.550> this<00:05:11.180> will<00:05:11.360> not<00:05:11.480> move<00:05:11.630> I

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:12.520 
is pretty solid this will not move I

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:15.340 
is pretty solid this will not move I
needed<00:05:13.520> a<00:05:13.610> way<00:05:13.820> because<00:05:14.120> this<00:05:14.360> has<00:05:14.570> a<00:05:14.600> positive

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:15.350 
needed a way because this has a positive

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:19.210 
needed a way because this has a positive
12<00:05:16.280> volt<00:05:16.550> charge<00:05:17.240> on<00:05:17.510> it<00:05:17.630> and<00:05:17.870> you<00:05:18.740> can't<00:05:19.010> let

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:19.220 
12 volt charge on it and you can't let

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:22.030 
12 volt charge on it and you can't let
it<00:05:19.280> touch<00:05:19.640> this<00:05:20.500> quarter-inch<00:05:21.500> plate<00:05:21.740> steel

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:22.040 
it touch this quarter-inch plate steel

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:25.870 
it touch this quarter-inch plate steel
here<00:05:22.340> because<00:05:23.030> this<00:05:23.180> is<00:05:23.360> the<00:05:23.540> negative<00:05:24.430> so<00:05:25.430> if

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:25.880 
here because this is the negative so if

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:27.490 
here because this is the negative so if
you<00:05:26.030> let<00:05:26.420> these<00:05:26.600> two<00:05:26.840> touch<00:05:27.110> you're<00:05:27.290> going<00:05:27.410> too

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:27.500 
you let these two touch you're going too

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:30.550 
you let these two touch you're going too
short<00:05:27.710> right<00:05:27.860> out<00:05:28.010> I<00:05:28.690> luckily<00:05:29.690> had<00:05:30.140> this<00:05:30.320> piece

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:30.560 
short right out I luckily had this piece

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:33.360 
short right out I luckily had this piece
of<00:05:30.740> quarter-inch<00:05:31.280> bakelite<00:05:31.930> laying<00:05:32.930> around

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:33.370 
of quarter-inch bakelite laying around

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:36.480 
of quarter-inch bakelite laying around
and<00:05:34.370> what<00:05:34.550> I<00:05:34.580> did<00:05:34.850> is<00:05:34.970> on<00:05:35.000> the<00:05:35.210> underside<00:05:35.510> I

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:36.490 
and what I did is on the underside I

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:39.700 
and what I did is on the underside I
drilled<00:05:37.490> a<00:05:37.580> hole<00:05:37.610> and<00:05:37.970> I<00:05:38.600> countersunk<00:05:39.350> the

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:39.710 
drilled a hole and I countersunk the

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:44.950 
drilled a hole and I countersunk the
head<00:05:39.980> so<00:05:40.880> so<00:05:41.600> it's<00:05:41.780> inside<00:05:42.440> the<00:05:42.770> bakelite<00:05:43.960> what

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:44.960 
head so so it's inside the bakelite what

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:46.990 
head so so it's inside the bakelite what
I<00:05:44.990> did<00:05:45.170> is<00:05:45.290> I<00:05:45.380> countersunk<00:05:46.040> the<00:05:46.430> head<00:05:46.700> of<00:05:46.880> the

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:47.000 
I did is I countersunk the head of the

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:51.250 
I did is I countersunk the head of the
screw<00:05:47.770> but<00:05:48.770> within<00:05:49.190> the<00:05:49.850> bakelite<00:05:50.750> this<00:05:51.050> way

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:51.260 
screw but within the bakelite this way

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:53.650 
screw but within the bakelite this way
when<00:05:51.470> this<00:05:51.620> wing<00:05:51.890> that's<00:05:52.100> tight<00:05:52.490> the<00:05:53.450> head<00:05:53.630> of

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:53.660 
when this wing that's tight the head of

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:55.840 
when this wing that's tight the head of
the<00:05:53.810> screw<00:05:54.050> can't<00:05:54.530> transfer<00:05:55.040> to<00:05:55.190> 12<00:05:55.430> volts

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:55.850 
the screw can't transfer to 12 volts

00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:58.030 
the screw can't transfer to 12 volts
from<00:05:56.030> the<00:05:56.150> heatsink<00:05:56.600> to<00:05:56.810> the<00:05:57.440> angle<00:05:57.830> plate

00:05:58.030 --> 00:05:58.040 
from the heatsink to the angle plate

00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:00.370 
from the heatsink to the angle plate
through<00:05:58.370> the<00:05:58.520> screw<00:05:58.790> to<00:05:59.090> this<00:05:59.180> plate<00:05:59.480> so<00:05:59.690> now

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:00.380 
through the screw to this plate so now

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:02.980 
through the screw to this plate so now
this<00:06:00.590> is<00:06:00.650> isolated<00:06:01.430> from<00:06:01.640> the<00:06:01.940> deck<00:06:02.150> and

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:02.990 
this is isolated from the deck and

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:08.710 
this is isolated from the deck and
that's<00:06:03.650> it<00:06:04.300> try<00:06:05.300> it<00:06:05.360> out<00:06:05.570> ran<00:06:05.930> it<00:06:07.720> total

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:08.720 
that's it try it out ran it total

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:12.730 
that's it try it out ran it total
perfection<00:06:09.230> works<00:06:09.470> great

00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:12.740 

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:18.140 

so<00:06:15.080> any<00:06:16.080> problem<00:06:16.499> arises<00:06:16.819> there<00:06:17.819> are<00:06:17.939> easy

00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:18.150 
so any problem arises there are easy

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:20.510 
so any problem arises there are easy
