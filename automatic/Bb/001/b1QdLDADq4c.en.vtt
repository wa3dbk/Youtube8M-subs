 Hello, you are watching the video version 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:12.150
 text lesson imitate watercolor 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:14.670
 the effect in this tutorial we will create 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.660
 watercolor effect in oriental style 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:20.119
 painting 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.119
 let's get to our work 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:27.290
 open under 

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:29.660
 walking images that will be 

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:31.210
 use to create this 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:35.890
 effect 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:45.760
 duplicate the existing layer 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:48.770
 a copy of the layer is called layer 1 and discolored 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:52.190
 image choose images 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:57.739
 correction to discolor or press shift 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:01:05.500
 control for this duplicate existing 

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:08.630
 layer 1 and being on layer 1 copy 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:12.409
 we invert the image we select 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:17.630
 image inversion correction 

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:20.810
 or press control and change the mode 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:28.990
 blending this layer 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:30.800
 the basics are now being on layer 1 copy 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:35.090
 choose a filter 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:40.150
 another minimum and set the value here 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:40.150
 radius one click ok 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:47.660
 open the layer blending options they 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:48.290
 are right here where the styles are 

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:52.660
 layer 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:55.820
 top line overlay options and 

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:59.840
 do so in the overlay happening 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:02.060
 on the light areas of the underlying layer if 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:04.570
 we just move the slider who 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:07.959
 our border will be too sharp 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:11.390
 so press alt and 

00:02:07.959 --> 00:02:13.629
 we move the slider to two components 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:16.310
 in 2 halves 

00:02:13.629 --> 00:02:20.620
 this way we get smoothly and 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:20.620
 overlay on the underlying layer 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:29.160
 pressing 

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:29.160
 ok applying the settings 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:36.100
 now combine the two existing layers 

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:41.040
 allocated and press kontrol r on 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:44.050
 keyboard and duplicate layer 1 again 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:45.930
 You can also click for this control 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:51.160
 jay 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:55.720
 For a copy of the layer, use the blur filter 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:58.960
 gauss blur select here 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:01.290
 a suitable radius of about six pixels 

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:04.450
 press ok 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:11.950
 overlay mode 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:18.100
 change to linear dimmer go 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:18.930
 onto a background layer and duplicate its copy 

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:24.250
 layer 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:28.800
 we transfer a mode over all layers 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:28.800
 overlay we change to chromaticity 

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:37.510
 apply to this top layer 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:42.870
 image correction curves set 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:42.870
 point on the curve and brighten the image 

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:51.660
 click ok now we add a mask to 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:55.090
 this layer and fill it with black 

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:59.430
 or you can invert it by clicking for 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:59.430
 this counter and on the keyboard 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:11.280
 create a new layer on top of all layers and 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:11.280
 fill it with the next color 

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:24.080
 With such a light yellow color choose 

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:27.229
 for this tool pouring and fill 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:32.620
 layer in selected color blend mode 

00:04:27.229 --> 00:04:32.620
 change layer by linear dimmer 

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:40.990
 now go to layer 1 bottom 

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:43.880
 our layer which is above the background 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:48.410
 lower its opacity so that we have 

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:55.820
 shined background at your discretion 65 

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:59.690
 maybe a little more percent and in 

00:04:55.820 --> 00:05:02.289
 Conclusion go to the mask layer background 

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:02.289
 copy 

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:12.550
 choose a soft round brush with 

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:12.550
 opacity is about 60 percent and 

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:22.840
 choosing white as the main color 

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:30.889
 we draw on the face of the girl and her hands 

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:34.669
 adding colors to our image and on 

00:05:30.889 --> 00:05:37.360
 this is our lesson over here such 

00:05:34.669 --> 00:05:40.360
 watercolor effect as a result of us 

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:40.360
 turned out
