00:00:04.759 --> 00:00:09.690
 well I think any selection is 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:12.929
 always rewarding for for the 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:16.770
 players and that's it even though we lost 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:18.990
 his two games bah I'll try to 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:23.100
 positively the thing because see I 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:24.560
 think there is little too much bad 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:28.650
 things and also good things so 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:31.560
 no longer be in that sense there 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:34.980
 well done it was a good selection 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:37.620
 it allowed me to taste a little bit 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:40.530
 international experience and 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.090
 I have been very well received here 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.730
 I played the first game and it was 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:47.610
 well done I 'm going to the first match and 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:50.820
 it was fitting that me and the others 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:53.190
 do not play the second match 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.360
 and precisely web because we also have 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.770
 deadlines waiting for us here 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.649
 unfortunately we could not come back 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:00.390
 earlier but here we have been preserved on 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.949
 took the second match and there 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.080
 now directly involved in 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.589
 job today we participated in 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.479
 training 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:09.420
 here we are preparing it 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:11.670
 calmly come on come we make each 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.619
 week before before the matches but these 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.950
 famous play so in expected for 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:19.830
 some and unexpected for others ben 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:22.020
 yeah I think it's already pronounced 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.990
 it is the result of work and 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:27.900
 now we are going as outsider in these 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.590
 play-offs 1 and I hope we will do 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.990
 best courses 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.659
 yeah well here's it's matches 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.789
 we like to play 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:37.159
 during the classical phase it was 

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:39.560
 matches where we took pleasure in 

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:41.630
 to play and especially that our supporters 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:43.340
 were each time present with us and 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:45.009
 here I hope they will be there again 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:47.590
 many during these playoffs 

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:50.719
 naturally it's really fun 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:53.959
 and we see that see the fans 

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:55.369
 are really all that last match 

00:01:53.959 --> 00:01:59.359
 after months that come more needs 

00:01:55.369 --> 00:02:01.399
 many so objective we are we 

00:01:59.359 --> 00:02:05.299
 to make sure there is no more 

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:07.629
 empty place I think it's good 

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:07.629
 party for
