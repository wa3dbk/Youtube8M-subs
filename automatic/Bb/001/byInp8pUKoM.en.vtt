obviously the oil companies will keep

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:53.059 
obviously the oil companies will keep
20%<00:03:49.890> of<00:03:50.129> the<00:03:50.400> profits<00:03:50.640> and<00:03:51.150> the<00:03:52.080> rest<00:03:52.560> will<00:03:53.040> go

not to get the oil not at all you see
because<00:04:02.030> all<00:04:02.239> the<00:04:02.719> the<00:04:03.109> fields<00:04:03.530> have<00:04:03.680> been

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:03.920 
because all the the fields have been

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:06.970 
because all the the fields have been
mapped<00:04:04.579> and<00:04:05.060> that<00:04:05.780> there<00:04:05.959> are<00:04:05.989> no<00:04:06.139> exploration

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:06.980

mapped and that there are no exploration
costs<00:04:07.639> and<00:04:07.999> and<00:04:08.450> the<00:04:08.569> oil<00:04:08.749> is<00:04:09.019> just<00:04:09.049> beneath

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:09.530 
costs and and the oil is just beneath

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:11.890 
costs and and the oil is just beneath
the<00:04:09.920> surface<00:04:10.129> of<00:04:10.459> the<00:04:10.639> sand<00:04:10.939> so<00:04:11.389> all<00:04:11.569> you<00:04:11.719> have

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:11.900 
the surface of the sand so all you have

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:13.959 
the surface of the sand so all you have
to<00:04:12.049> do<00:04:12.200> is<00:04:12.379> pump<00:04:12.590> it<00:04:12.739> out<00:04:12.829> yes<00:04:13.459> well<00:04:13.819> then<00:04:13.939> I
