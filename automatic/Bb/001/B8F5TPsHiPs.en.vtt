of<00:03:30.959> vanilla<00:03:31.079> but<00:03:31.769> not<00:03:32.040> as<00:03:32.220> warm<00:03:32.549> as<00:03:33.000> this<00:03:33.359> one

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:33.630 
of vanilla but not as warm as this one

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:35.300 
of vanilla but not as warm as this one
like<00:03:33.780> it<00:03:33.900> doesn't<00:03:34.079> have<00:03:34.349> that<00:03:34.380> kick<00:03:34.859> of<00:03:35.040> warmth

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310 
like it doesn't have that kick of warmth

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:36.710 
like it doesn't have that kick of warmth
in<00:03:35.400> this<00:03:35.489> because<00:03:35.790> it's<00:03:35.910> only<00:03:36.060> a<00:03:36.180> very<00:03:36.420> subtle

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:36.720 
in this because it's only a very subtle

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:38.750 
in this because it's only a very subtle
smell<00:03:37.139> of<00:03:37.260> vanilla<00:03:37.319> so<00:03:37.980> if<00:03:38.069> you<00:03:38.160> are<00:03:38.340> a<00:03:38.370> huge

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.060 
one for kind of morning's daytime or

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:53.270 
one for kind of morning's daytime or

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:55.160 
even like a date like in the evening
time<00:03:53.430> as<00:03:53.610> well<00:03:53.760> but<00:03:54.120> it's<00:03:54.299> more<00:03:54.480> of<00:03:54.540> a<00:03:54.659> summery

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:55.170 
time as well but it's more of a summery

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:57.540 
time as well but it's more of a summery
scent<00:03:55.590> because<00:03:55.890> it's<00:03:56.159> a<00:03:56.250> lot<00:03:56.459> lighter<00:03:56.819> a<00:03:57.060> lot

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:57.550

routier<00:03:57.910> I<00:03:58.180> really<00:03:58.690> like<00:03:58.840> this<00:03:58.990> one<00:03:59.200> I<00:03:59.440> find

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:00.010 
routier I really like this one I find

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:01.680 
routier I really like this one I find
that<00:04:00.160> I<00:04:00.220> probably<00:04:00.520> used<00:04:00.910> they<00:04:01.150> stolen<00:04:01.420> more<00:04:01.630> in

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:01.690 
that I probably used they stolen more in

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:03.030 
that I probably used they stolen more in
the<00:04:01.780> summer<00:04:01.930> and<00:04:02.200> then<00:04:02.350> moving<00:04:02.590> on<00:04:02.830> to<00:04:02.860> this

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:03.040 
the summer and then moving on to this

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:04.440 
the summer and then moving on to this
one<00:04:03.220> in<00:04:03.340> the<00:04:03.430> winter<00:04:03.730> because<00:04:03.880> it<00:04:04.120> says<00:04:04.300> that

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:04.450 
one in the winter because it says that

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:06.840 
one in the winter because it says that
wants<00:04:04.840> this<00:04:04.990> to<00:04:05.200> it<00:04:05.350> but<00:04:05.830> I<00:04:05.860> really<00:04:06.280> like<00:04:06.490> the

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:06.850 
wants this to it but I really like the

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:08.280 
wants this to it but I really like the
combination<00:04:07.120> of<00:04:07.480> these<00:04:07.630> two<00:04:07.870> I<00:04:07.900> think<00:04:08.110> if

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:08.290 
combination of these two I think if

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:09.360 
combination of these two I think if
you're<00:04:08.410> a<00:04:08.470> big<00:04:08.590> fan<00:04:08.740> of<00:04:08.770> this<00:04:08.950> one<00:04:09.130> then<00:04:09.250> you're

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:09.370 
you're a big fan of this one then you're

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:10.980 
you're a big fan of this one then you're
gonna<00:04:09.490> be<00:04:09.640> a<00:04:09.670> big<00:04:09.820> fan<00:04:10.000> of<00:04:10.030> this<00:04:10.210> one<00:04:10.420> and<00:04:10.600> vice

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:10.990 
gonna be a big fan of this one and vice

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:12.810 
gonna be a big fan of this one and vice
versa<00:04:11.440> the<00:04:11.620> next<00:04:11.830> perfume<00:04:12.220> is<00:04:12.400> simply<00:04:12.790> just

called so this one I think is one of the
best<00:04:16.180> ones<00:04:16.390> that<00:04:16.480> Walden<00:04:16.780> because<00:04:17.260> it<00:04:17.380> lingers

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:17.830 
best ones that Walden because it lingers
