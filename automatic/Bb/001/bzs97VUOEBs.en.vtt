00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
so I've been putting like hard core

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.020

explain<00:01:15.270> but<00:01:15.650> I've<00:01:16.650> been<00:01:16.770> like<00:01:17.159> going<00:01:17.310> nuts

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580

for<00:01:17.700> this<00:01:17.909> group<00:01:18.270> playing<00:01:18.479> pro<00:01:18.750> victories<00:01:19.200> and

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:19.820 
for this group playing pro victories and

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:21.980 
for this group playing pro victories and
I'm<00:01:20.820> reflecting<00:01:21.060> casual<00:01:21.630> because<00:01:21.720> there's

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
I'm reflecting casual because there's

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.960 
I'm reflecting casual because there's
not<00:01:22.110> a<00:01:22.170> lot<00:01:22.320> of<00:01:22.350> people<00:01:22.439> and<00:01:22.979> when<00:01:23.850> you<00:01:23.939> have

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
not a lot of people and when you have

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.109 
not a lot of people and when you have
like<00:01:24.119> four<00:01:25.310> coordinated<00:01:26.310> teammates<00:01:26.850> I<00:01:26.970> guess

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
like four coordinated teammates I guess

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:28.730 
like four coordinated teammates I guess
you<00:01:27.210> could<00:01:27.330> say<00:01:27.450> if<00:01:27.630> it<00:01:27.990> coordinate<00:01:28.439> teamed

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
you could say if it coordinate teamed

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.920 
you could say if it coordinate teamed
easy<00:01:29.100> to<00:01:29.310> win<00:01:29.490> no<00:01:29.700> matter<00:01:29.820> the<00:01:30.270> other<00:01:30.540> people's

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
easy to win no matter the other people's

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.770 
easy to win no matter the other people's
skill<00:01:31.200> level<00:01:31.790> like<00:01:32.790> we've<00:01:32.970> had<00:01:33.180> played<00:01:33.450> teams

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
skill level like we've had played teams

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.390 
skill level like we've had played teams
that<00:01:33.930> are<00:01:34.079> way<00:01:34.409> better<00:01:34.590> than<00:01:34.740> us<00:01:34.890> but<00:01:35.189> we've

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
that are way better than us but we've

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.429 
that are way better than us but we've
won<00:01:35.880> because<00:01:36.180> we're<00:01:36.540> more<00:01:36.810> coordinated<00:01:37.170> them

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
won because we're more coordinated them

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:40.460 
won because we're more coordinated them

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:24.960 
maps on one of them is called zoo which
i<00:03:23.200> think<00:03:23.260> it's<00:03:23.560> gonna<00:03:23.739> be<00:03:23.920> like<00:03:24.100> coming<00:03:24.910> an

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:24.970 
i think it's gonna be like coming an

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:27.090 
i think it's gonna be like coming an
animal<00:03:25.390> testing<00:03:25.780> facility<00:03:26.230> because<00:03:26.890> i<00:03:27.040> know

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:27.100 
animal testing facility because i know

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:29.340 
animal testing facility because i know
like<00:03:27.280> you<00:03:27.819> getting<00:03:28.180> the<00:03:28.239> campaign<00:03:28.630> a<00:03:28.900> lot<00:03:29.260> of

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:29.350 
like you getting the campaign a lot of

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:31.349 
like you getting the campaign a lot of
these<00:03:29.410> the<00:03:29.799> places<00:03:30.400> i<00:03:30.579> place<00:03:31.060> it<00:03:31.090> with<00:03:31.329> a

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:31.359 
these the places i place it with a

00:03:31.359 --> 00:03:32.910 
these the places i place it with a
thought<00:03:31.600> so<00:03:31.780> everyone's<00:03:32.019> safe<00:03:32.230> out<00:03:32.739> of<00:03:32.799> the

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:32.920 
thought so everyone's safe out of the

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:35.069 
thought so everyone's safe out of the
countries<00:03:33.310> they<00:03:33.430> tested<00:03:33.940> on<00:03:34.030> animals<00:03:34.239> like

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:35.079 
countries they tested on animals like

00:03:35.079 --> 00:03:36.569 
countries they tested on animals like
monkeys<00:03:35.380> and<00:03:35.709> shit<00:03:35.889> you<00:03:35.980> see<00:03:36.069> you<00:03:36.160> from<00:03:36.280> nova

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:36.579 
monkeys and shit you see you from nova

00:03:36.579 --> 00:03:40.020 
monkeys and shit you see you from nova
gasps<00:03:36.760> there's<00:03:38.130> mn5<00:03:39.130> the<00:03:39.459> zombie<00:03:39.730> map<00:03:39.880> they

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:40.030 
gasps there's mn5 the zombie map they

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:42.449 
gasps there's mn5 the zombie map they
test<00:03:40.269> on<00:03:40.450> a<00:03:40.480> i<00:03:40.930> think<00:03:41.019> a<00:03:41.200> pig<00:03:41.440> or<00:03:41.590> warthogs<00:03:42.220> i'm

00:03:42.449 --> 00:03:42.459 
test on a i think a pig or warthogs i'm

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:44.190 
test on a i think a pig or warthogs i'm
like<00:03:42.609> that<00:03:42.790> so<00:03:43.329> it's<00:03:43.450> probably<00:03:43.690> something

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:44.200 
like that so it's probably something

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:46.470 
like that so it's probably something
like<00:03:44.350> that<00:03:44.590> i<00:03:44.799> could<00:03:45.100> be<00:03:45.220> wrong<00:03:45.389> there's<00:03:46.389> one

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:46.480 
like that i could be wrong there's one

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:49.979 
like that i could be wrong there's one
that's<00:03:47.049> called<00:03:48.090> until<00:03:49.090> Douglas<00:03:49.329> one's<00:03:49.810> got

00:03:49.979 --> 00:03:49.989 
that's called until Douglas one's got

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:52.590 
that's called until Douglas one's got
hotel<00:03:50.500> which<00:03:51.160> is<00:03:51.190> probably<00:03:51.730> gonna<00:03:52.150> be<00:03:52.359> like<00:03:52.389> an

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:52.600 
hotel which is probably gonna be like an

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:55.410 
hotel which is probably gonna be like an
urban<00:03:53.079> setting<00:03:53.319> maps<00:03:53.730> probably<00:03:54.730> similar<00:03:55.000> to<00:03:55.389> a

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:55.420 
urban setting maps probably similar to a

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:58.770 
urban setting maps probably similar to a
mini<00:03:56.139> stadium<00:03:56.790> yeah<00:03:57.790> maybe<00:03:58.180> stadium<00:03:58.569> like<00:03:58.660> an

00:03:58.770 --> 00:03:58.780 
mini stadium yeah maybe stadium like an

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:02.309 
mini stadium yeah maybe stadium like an
urban<00:03:59.170> setting<00:03:59.380> map<00:04:00.510> or<00:04:01.510> croc<00:04:01.870> probably

00:04:02.309 --> 00:04:02.319 
urban setting map or croc probably

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:04.860 
urban setting map or croc probably
mainly<00:04:02.530> indoors<00:04:03.130> a<00:04:03.489> lot<00:04:03.970> of<00:04:04.000> Windows<00:04:04.420> or<00:04:04.720> maybe

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:04.870 
mainly indoors a lot of Windows or maybe

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:06.569 
mainly indoors a lot of Windows or maybe
like<00:04:05.049> high-rise<00:04:05.440> I<00:04:05.590> don't<00:04:05.739> know<00:04:05.799> but<00:04:06.100> a<00:04:06.280> lot<00:04:06.340> of

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:06.579 
like high-rise I don't know but a lot of

00:04:06.579 --> 00:04:09.149 
like high-rise I don't know but a lot of
Windows<00:04:06.910> probably<00:04:07.420> just<00:04:07.630> like<00:04:07.690> a<00:04:07.750> big<00:04:08.470> I<00:04:08.769> think

00:04:09.149 --> 00:04:09.159 
Windows probably just like a big I think

00:04:09.159 --> 00:04:11.070 
Windows probably just like a big I think
I<00:04:09.340> might<00:04:09.790> be<00:04:09.819> a<00:04:09.939> bigger<00:04:10.239> map<00:04:10.480> kind<00:04:10.780> of

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:11.080 
I might be a bigger map kind of

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:13.260 
I might be a bigger map kind of
another<00:04:11.890> one<00:04:12.010> is<00:04:12.070> called<00:04:12.280> stockpile<00:04:12.850> Scott

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:13.270 
another one is called stockpile Scott

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:16.020 
another one is called stockpile Scott
products<00:04:13.600> kind<00:04:13.870> of<00:04:13.930> like<00:04:14.020> a<00:04:14.080> snowy<00:04:14.470> map<00:04:14.740> um<00:04:15.030> you

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:16.030 
products kind of like a snowy map um you

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:18.030 
products kind of like a snowy map um you
can't<00:04:16.209> release<00:04:16.390> how<00:04:17.110> much<00:04:17.290> about<00:04:17.500> it<00:04:17.680> looks

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:18.040 
can't release how much about it looks

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:20.759 
can't release how much about it looks
like<00:04:18.160> this<00:04:18.310> snow<00:04:18.900> it's<00:04:19.900> probably<00:04:20.290> get<00:04:20.680> us

00:04:20.759 --> 00:04:20.769 
like this snow it's probably get us

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:24.060 
like this snow it's probably get us
something<00:04:21.010> to<00:04:21.130> do<00:04:21.370> with<00:04:22.710> maybe<00:04:23.710> might<00:04:23.920> have<00:04:23.950> to

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:24.070 
something to do with maybe might have to

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:25.500 
something to do with maybe might have to
do<00:04:24.130> something<00:04:24.310> when<00:04:24.520> world<00:04:24.850> war<00:04:24.910> two<00:04:25.210> again

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:25.510 
do something when world war two again

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:29.070 
do something when world war two again
like<00:04:26.020> the<00:04:26.920> other<00:04:27.070> snowy<00:04:27.310> map<00:04:27.520> did<00:04:27.900> it<00:04:28.900> is<00:04:29.050> still

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:29.080 
like the other snowy map did it is still

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:30.720 
like the other snowy map did it is still
not<00:04:29.320> discovery<00:04:30.040> might<00:04:30.310> have<00:04:30.400> something<00:04:30.610> to<00:04:30.640> do

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:30.730 
not discovery might have something to do

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:32.700 
not discovery might have something to do
with<00:04:30.760> that<00:04:30.970> like<00:04:31.240> the<00:04:31.540> like<00:04:32.350> when<00:04:32.500> you're<00:04:32.620> on

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:32.710 
with that like the like when you're on

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:34.230 
with that like the like when you're on
the<00:04:32.740> boat<00:04:33.040> I<00:04:33.250> don't<00:04:33.490> know<00:04:33.640> I<00:04:33.850> don't<00:04:33.940> remember

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:34.240 
the boat I don't know I don't remember

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:35.940 
the boat I don't know I don't remember
much<00:04:34.540> of<00:04:34.600> the<00:04:34.780> story<00:04:34.990> missions<00:04:35.380> and<00:04:35.740> the<00:04:35.800> last

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:35.950 
much of the story missions and the last

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:38.550 
much of the story missions and the last
one<00:04:36.070> is<00:04:36.100> called<00:04:36.340> convoy<00:04:36.910> which<00:04:37.630> looks<00:04:38.200> to<00:04:38.410> me

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:38.560 
one is called convoy which looks to me

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:41.640 
one is called convoy which looks to me
like<00:04:38.590> it's<00:04:38.980> a<00:04:39.670> u.s.<00:04:40.330> freeway<00:04:40.960> which<00:04:41.530> is

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:41.650 
like it's a u.s. freeway which is

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:43.080 
like it's a u.s. freeway which is
probably<00:04:41.890> gonna<00:04:42.070> be<00:04:42.160> another<00:04:42.400> map<00:04:42.640> which<00:04:42.910> is

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:43.090 
probably gonna be another map which is

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:44.760 
probably gonna be another map which is
within<00:04:43.330> the<00:04:43.480> u.s.<00:04:43.900> that<00:04:44.140> maybe<00:04:44.350> I<00:04:44.440> got<00:04:44.650> two

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:44.770 
within the u.s. that maybe I got two

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:47.910 
within the u.s. that maybe I got two
trucks<00:04:45.150> cars<00:04:46.150> covering<00:04:46.600> the<00:04:46.690> road<00:04:46.930> probably

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:47.920 
trucks cars covering the road probably

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:50.820 
trucks cars covering the road probably
get<00:04:48.160> to<00:04:48.370> a<00:04:48.670> two-lane<00:04:49.540> highway<00:04:49.990> something<00:04:50.440> like

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:50.830 
get to a two-lane highway something like

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:52.650 
get to a two-lane highway something like
that<00:04:51.010> but<00:04:51.430> i<00:04:51.580> really<00:04:51.790> hope<00:04:51.910> trucked<00:04:52.300> is<00:04:52.390> a<00:04:52.420> good

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:52.660 
that but i really hope trucked is a good

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:54.840 
that but i really hope trucked is a good
job<00:04:52.840> with<00:04:52.960> his<00:04:53.080> backpack<00:04:53.440> is<00:04:53.620> the<00:04:54.430> last<00:04:54.610> map

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:54.850 
job with his backpack is the last map

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:56.310 
job with his backpack is the last map
fact<00:04:55.030> they<00:04:55.120> put<00:04:55.330> out<00:04:55.420> it<00:04:55.630> wasn't<00:04:55.810> the<00:04:56.020> best

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:56.320 
fact they put out it wasn't the best

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:58.470 
fact they put out it wasn't the best
like<00:04:57.010> they<00:04:57.640> could<00:04:57.820> they<00:04:58.210> could<00:04:58.240> have<00:04:58.450> done

00:04:58.470 --> 00:04:58.480 
like they could they could have done

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:00.630 
like they could they could have done
better<00:04:58.690> like<00:04:58.960> map<00:04:59.140> pack<00:04:59.320> one<00:04:59.560> world<00:04:59.830> at<00:04:59.950> war<00:05:00.130> it

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:00.640 
better like map pack one world at war it

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:02.340 
better like map pack one world at war it
was<00:05:00.760> absolutely<00:05:01.180> unreal<00:05:01.630> to<00:05:01.780> my<00:05:01.870> favorite<00:05:02.200> map

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:02.350 
was absolutely unreal to my favorite map

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:04.320 
was absolutely unreal to my favorite map
pack<00:05:02.530> of<00:05:02.680> all<00:05:02.770> time<00:05:02.980> but<00:05:03.670> you<00:05:03.730> had<00:05:03.880> such<00:05:04.120> good

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:04.330 
pack of all time but you had such good

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:38.980 
perks over and over again but after a

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:40.470 
perks over and over again but after a
while<00:05:39.310> it<00:05:39.580> just<00:05:39.640> gets<00:05:39.910> annoying<00:05:40.030> and<00:05:40.390> your

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:40.480 
while it just gets annoying and your

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:42.330 
while it just gets annoying and your
perks<00:05:40.720> your<00:05:41.020> points<00:05:41.350> just<00:05:41.560> slowly<00:05:41.770> drain<00:05:42.130> and

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:42.340 
perks your points just slowly drain and

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:43.740 
perks your points just slowly drain and
when<00:05:42.730> you<00:05:42.790> died<00:05:43.060> you<00:05:43.300> gotta<00:05:43.419> get<00:05:43.540> them<00:05:43.660> all

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:43.750 
when you died you gotta get them all

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:46.080 
when you died you gotta get them all
back<00:05:43.930> it<00:05:44.140> just<00:05:44.169> doesn't<00:05:44.560> work<00:05:44.620> out<00:05:44.830> so<00:05:45.580> that's

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:46.090 
back it just doesn't work out so that's

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:47.730 
back it just doesn't work out so that's
like<00:05:46.630> the<00:05:46.780> monkey<00:05:47.080> is<00:05:47.110> the<00:05:47.260> only<00:05:47.380> reason

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:47.740 
like the monkey is the only reason

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:49.800 
like the monkey is the only reason
anyone<00:05:48.280> doesn't<00:05:48.760> buy<00:05:49.030> all<00:05:49.240> the<00:05:49.360> perks<00:05:49.570> which

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:49.810 
anyone doesn't buy all the perks which

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:51.960 
anyone doesn't buy all the perks which
kind<00:05:50.110> of<00:05:50.140> makes<00:05:50.260> it<00:05:50.350> a<00:05:50.410> lot<00:05:50.500> harder<00:05:50.700> so<00:05:51.700> I<00:05:51.730> hope

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:51.970 
kind of makes it a lot harder so I hope

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:53.700 
kind of makes it a lot harder so I hope
they<00:05:52.180> just<00:05:52.450> stick<00:05:52.690> with<00:05:52.840> dogs<00:05:53.140> because<00:05:53.500> dogs

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:53.710 
they just stick with dogs because dogs

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:55.409 
they just stick with dogs because dogs
were<00:05:54.370> kind<00:05:54.610> of<00:05:54.669> hard<00:05:54.850> if<00:05:54.970> you<00:05:55.030> don't<00:05:55.150> have<00:05:55.240> ammo

00:05:55.409 --> 00:05:55.419 
were kind of hard if you don't have ammo

00:05:55.419 --> 00:05:57.390 
were kind of hard if you don't have ammo
but<00:05:55.660> other<00:05:55.870> than<00:05:56.020> that<00:05:56.110> like<00:05:56.710> in<00:05:56.860> keno<00:05:57.220> if<00:05:57.340> you

00:05:57.390 --> 00:05:57.400 
but other than that like in keno if you

00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:58.890 
but other than that like in keno if you
just<00:05:57.580> turn<00:05:57.729> on<00:05:57.760> one<00:05:57.970> of<00:05:58.030> the<00:05:58.090> Turks<00:05:58.360> you'd<00:05:58.780> be

00:05:58.890 --> 00:05:58.900 
just turn on one of the Turks you'd be

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:01.290 
just turn on one of the Turks you'd be
fine<00:05:59.140> with<00:05:59.320> dogs<00:05:59.500> just<00:05:59.860> uh<00:05:59.950> the<00:06:00.940> dogs<00:06:01.090> we've

I<00:06:06.160> think<00:06:06.340> the<00:06:06.430> map<00:06:06.640> it's<00:06:07.360> kind<00:06:07.450> of<00:06:07.540> ironic<00:06:07.630> cuz

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:08.110 
I think the map it's kind of ironic cuz

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:10.290 
I think the map it's kind of ironic cuz
I'm<00:06:08.290> a<00:06:08.590> lot<00:06:08.830> of<00:06:08.919> people<00:06:09.010> are<00:06:09.190> saying<00:06:09.400> that<00:06:10.000> the

00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:10.300 
I'm a lot of people are saying that the

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:12.360 
I'm a lot of people are saying that the
new<00:06:10.419> genre<00:06:10.750> might<00:06:10.990> be<00:06:11.110> on<00:06:11.169> firing<00:06:11.500> range<00:06:11.770> so<00:06:12.100> I

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:12.370 
new genre might be on firing range so I

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:15.480 
new genre might be on firing range so I
hope<00:06:13.300> they<00:06:13.479> had<00:06:13.600> lots<00:06:13.810> of<00:06:13.960> stuff<00:06:14.380> like<00:06:14.680> uh<00:06:14.710> like

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:15.490 
hope they had lots of stuff like uh like

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:17.640 
hope they had lots of stuff like uh like
maybe<00:06:15.790> in<00:06:16.030> the<00:06:16.120> helicopters<00:06:16.750> outside<00:06:16.960> you
