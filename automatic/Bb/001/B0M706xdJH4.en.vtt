00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:10.500
 sets with elastics 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:12.960

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.929
 which I need besides these rezinochek 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:18.330

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:22.230
 I have this big closet 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:25.230

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:27.720

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.880
 part 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:35.250
 but let's get started so well 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:38.579
 I 'll probably start with the sets that I 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.360
 bought today the first one was this 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.629

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:44.129

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.940

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.340
 rezinochek 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.829

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:53.640

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:57.719
 hook he next it was such 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:59.609
 Here's a set of flowers, even though he has 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:03.210
 little rubber but it all looks 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:06.470
 nice enough further it was here 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.470

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:16.070

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:18.780
 here are the things for bracelets to 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:21.030

 Yes, further this is something that does not have 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:59.540
 relationship to the rezinochkami first is 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:02:03.320
