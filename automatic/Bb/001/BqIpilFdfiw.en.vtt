00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.020
 i have incredibly low taxes and we start 

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:05.610
 to draw water archer 

00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:08.270
 I think the first toy that 

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:10.180
 atom atom such a version 

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:13.569
 made me sitnik suspense 

00:00:13.569 --> 00:00:15.429
 and in general, I don't think it's worth it 

00:00:15.429 --> 00:00:18.699
 risk something else they stupidly smarting over 

00:00:18.699 --> 00:00:20.009
 your uah 

00:00:20.009 --> 00:00:22.429
 nights find a lot some media 

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:24.249
 you must be located 

00:00:24.249 --> 00:00:27.249
 I will give an example of Kazakhstan 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:31.029
 their traditions which 

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:31.849
 n 

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:34.680
 Well, in general, as they should inspire fear 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.850
 the man who plays him but 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:39.900
 they don't do it the other way around when 

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:42.250
 a woman but Beria Crimean had 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:43.370
 scream 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:46.050
 m about this reaction was not but 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:47.890
 yesterday when this bill rf sergey naryshkin 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:50.310
 visited will install more that 

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:51.240
 this work 

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:53.600
 of course i 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.550
 m remained impressed 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:58.020
 because uzhk limit is terrible 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.000
 grumble 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.250
 rubles 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.180
 municipal services terrible to me and 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:08.220
 I think if you do not understand it will be 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:09.210
 enough 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.090
 m sadly for those who will watch 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.369
 so as you play there is quite sadly 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.110
 I don't think for you 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.490
 charge I know what it is really 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:20.600
 extreme mida which happens 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.520
 very rarely much opportunity to sit 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:24.750
 is increasing 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.630
 top ten 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:28.770
 but pack our company love 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.930
 statistics let's continue playing 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:35.190
 I think I should have had a club 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:37.560
 so in the summer it's all about the headphones 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.430
 also that everyone has heard it all 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:42.900
 natural communication with the abolition of the general is not 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:46.330
 appearing to anyone who was mistaken 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:50.440
 I do not see what a nightmare is sleeping and 25 li kashin ast 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:53.710
 d person or not 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:56.900
 25 30 pcs coupon 

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:58.960
 for the knife 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:00.720
 but 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:03.420
 did not save Kiev 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:04.420
 lawyers 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:07.310
 increasingly men 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:09.679
 in the form and convince convincingly Petipa 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:10.780
 feminine 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:12.889
 I don't want to give myself 

00:02:12.889 --> 00:02:15.889
 we will not give up without a fight 

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:22.849
 cup 

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:24.859
 something like 

00:02:24.859 --> 00:02:26.839
 it was insurance let's do it again 

00:02:26.839 --> 00:02:28.669
 try 

00:02:28.669 --> 00:02:30.620
 rather tilt but came from 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:31.829
 on 11 

00:02:31.829 --> 00:02:34.019
 as far as I know this is some sort of rye 

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:36.489
 flying chistopolov walk by months and 

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:37.139
 see 

00:02:37.139 --> 00:02:40.319
 try to see and I yesterday her and resettlement 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:43.539
 the national is open the room 

00:02:43.539 --> 00:02:46.449
 but more and could not only find either 

00:02:46.449 --> 00:02:48.779
 blasphemous 

00:02:48.779 --> 00:02:51.019
 in 

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:53.559
 it seems to me to remain on a certain also 

00:02:53.559 --> 00:02:55.319
 then disappears 

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:58.159
 I generally try as much as possible to look at 

00:02:58.159 --> 00:03:01.159
 dawn even in the dark with million 

00:03:01.889 --> 00:03:02.770
 m 

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:05.889
 until we see 

00:03:05.889 --> 00:03:08.049
 m her choice 

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:11.049
 it seems to me such a big plus because 

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:13.180
 what can we always say for it yet 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:14.089
 somewhere 

00:03:14.089 --> 00:03:16.259
 and see and renault 

00:03:16.259 --> 00:03:19.669
 honestly this sight is awful she is a divisional commander 

00:03:19.669 --> 00:03:22.529
 grass and nothing we are just like 

00:03:22.529 --> 00:03:24.669
 golden color 

00:03:24.669 --> 00:03:27.779
 I don’t know what exactly is on the market anymore 

00:03:27.779 --> 00:03:29.209
 than any there 

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:32.669
 First of all, I sat for models 

00:03:32.669 --> 00:03:35.379
 e 

00:03:35.379 --> 00:03:37.639
 I'm not trying to speak more louder 

00:03:37.639 --> 00:03:39.829
 pills do not think he will find this one 

00:03:39.829 --> 00:03:42.469
 m really are 

00:03:42.469 --> 00:03:45.469
 makes you nervous 

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:48.979
 knowing 

00:03:48.979 --> 00:03:51.579
 chemical holding 

00:03:51.579 --> 00:03:54.559
 number of bears 

00:03:54.559 --> 00:03:58.009
 he is against investment 

00:03:58.009 --> 00:03:59.829
 consider only for this center 

00:03:59.829 --> 00:04:01.599
 orthodoxy 

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:05.069
 m at this house all saw this as you 

00:04:06.409 --> 00:04:09.409
 percentage of people have not seen and heard 

00:04:10.009 --> 00:04:10.920
 in writing 

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:13.069
 new visit by the state number 

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:15.099
 may actually after this game not 

00:04:15.099 --> 00:04:17.009
 only 

00:04:17.009 --> 00:04:19.239
 and yet 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:22.789
 happy m well that is not something that 

00:04:22.789 --> 00:04:23.840
 communication 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:26.449
 how would my funk and lisandro do it 

00:04:26.449 --> 00:04:28.539
 May intends to do sang 

00:04:28.539 --> 00:04:31.539
 I think it's cool 

00:04:33.319 --> 00:04:35.909
 why did I go to these horror stories 

00:04:35.909 --> 00:04:36.540
 atrocities 

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:39.110
 played like schoolchildren are forced to play 

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:42.110
 dollars 

00:04:43.349 --> 00:04:45.969
 idea 

00:04:45.969 --> 00:04:47.989
 That was before Sochi scary the, that I 

00:04:47.989 --> 00:04:50.180
 first heard it 

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:52.919
 I think that if it’s better to do, that is, not 

00:04:52.919 --> 00:04:55.419
 I know what else they did here 

00:04:55.419 --> 00:04:58.300
 but shares in Minsk line then data 

00:04:58.300 --> 00:04:58.889
 stock exchanges 

00:04:58.889 --> 00:05:01.889
 and not boring you need a man 

00:05:04.189 --> 00:05:05.930
 I do nothing 

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:07.749
 well at least here 

00:05:07.749 --> 00:05:10.749
 here and love her nothing 

00:05:13.279 --> 00:05:16.279
 because there is no more than they ask me 

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:19.990
 he will become less 

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:22.990
 generally open came there was empty 

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:29.569
 not scary yet 

00:05:29.569 --> 00:05:31.809
 in fact it's quick that i have 

00:05:31.809 --> 00:05:32.990
 understand again 

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:35.770
 but most importantly you know plus washed that 

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:37.599
 there is no such acceleration 

00:05:37.599 --> 00:05:40.419
 consumer whose sushi tamma 

00:05:40.419 --> 00:05:41.659
 ruptured eardrums 

00:05:41.659 --> 00:05:44.779
 that is, everything is quite convenient 

00:05:44.779 --> 00:05:47.009
 play mytishchi speedometer to themselves 

00:05:47.009 --> 00:05:48.689

00:05:48.689 --> 00:05:51.620
 what a mistake ninth 

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:54.620
 but in a circle 

00:05:55.539 --> 00:05:58.409
 recall actually very hard 

00:05:58.409 --> 00:06:01.379

00:06:01.379 --> 00:06:02.539
 on 

00:06:02.539 --> 00:06:04.710
 edible but such faces flying 

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:07.050
 grabbed 

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:10.400
 breaking through pragne know why there are kryzhov 

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:13.539

00:06:13.539 --> 00:06:15.770
 but if he finds the data forever 

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:19.080
 I know that such setas are now 66 

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:22.290

00:06:35.279 --> 00:06:38.659
 becoming 

00:06:42.789 --> 00:06:45.930
 and it was considered 

00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:48.970
 I understand the camcorder and there is something happened

00:06:55.649 --> 00:06:57.300

 China was not 

00:07:00.479 --> 00:07:03.479

 rare thing 

00:07:29.090 --> 00:07:29.800
