get<00:00:35.470> we<00:00:36.470> went<00:00:36.649> for<00:00:36.860> tires<00:00:37.070> this<00:00:37.460> time<00:00:37.730> round

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:38.270 
get we went for tires this time round

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:42.280 
get we went for tires this time round
and<00:00:38.780> toddler<00:00:39.620> a<00:00:39.650> bit<00:00:39.830> faster<00:00:40.570> obviously<00:00:41.570> you

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:42.290 
and toddler a bit faster obviously you

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:44.050 
and toddler a bit faster obviously you
know<00:00:42.440> maybe<00:00:42.770> a<00:00:42.860> bit<00:00:43.040> slower<00:00:43.280> to<00:00:43.370> change<00:00:43.700> but<00:00:44.030> a

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:44.060 
know maybe a bit slower to change but a

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:45.490 
know maybe a bit slower to change but a
bit<00:00:44.270> more<00:00:44.300> reliable<00:00:44.600> to<00:00:44.900> change<00:00:45.110> lots<00:00:45.380> of

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:45.500 
bit more reliable to change lots of

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:47.350 
bit more reliable to change lots of
weights<00:00:45.650> as<00:00:45.830> well<00:00:45.890> so<00:00:46.340> so<00:00:46.850> that's<00:00:47.000> got<00:00:47.180> a<00:00:47.210> bit

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:47.360 
weights as well so so that's got a bit

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:50.080 
weights as well so so that's got a bit
easier<00:00:47.630> travelling<00:00:48.050> with<00:00:48.170> them<00:00:48.350> a<00:00:49.090> really

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:50.090 
easier travelling with them a really

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:52.150 
easier travelling with them a really
good<00:00:50.270> zip<00:00:50.600> bar<00:00:50.900> at<00:00:51.050> the<00:00:51.140> front<00:00:51.290> which<00:00:51.620> offers

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:52.160 
good zip bar at the front which offers

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:56.080 
good zip bar at the front which offers
all<00:00:52.310> sorts<00:00:52.790> of<00:00:53.230> ways<00:00:54.230> to<00:00:54.560> to<00:00:55.040> change<00:00:55.340> and<00:00:55.700> move

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:56.090 
all sorts of ways to to change and move

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:58.120 
all sorts of ways to to change and move
it<00:00:56.210> around<00:00:56.300> adjustability<00:00:56.930> which<00:00:57.770> is<00:00:57.890> great

00:00:58.120 --> 00:00:58.130 
it around adjustability which is great

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:59.590 
it around adjustability which is great
because<00:00:58.250> you<00:00:58.370> want<00:00:58.490> to<00:00:58.520> adjust<00:00:58.970> it<00:00:59.270> an<00:00:59.329> awful

00:00:59.590 --> 00:00:59.600 
because you want to adjust it an awful

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.960 
because you want to adjust it an awful
lot<00:00:59.829> and<00:01:00.829> obviously<00:01:01.100> we<00:01:01.220> do<00:01:01.340> most<00:01:01.760> of<00:01:01.850> our

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:01.970 
lot and obviously we do most of our

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:05.170 
lot and obviously we do most of our
riding<00:01:02.210> on<00:01:03.200> road<00:01:03.440> bikes<00:01:03.680> and<00:01:04.040> although<00:01:04.400> if<00:01:05.000> I'm

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:05.180 
riding on road bikes and although if I'm

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:06.490 
riding on road bikes and although if I'm
preparing<00:01:05.600> for<00:01:05.630> a<00:01:05.780> non<00:01:05.930> drafting<00:01:06.259> race<00:01:06.380> it

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:06.500 
preparing for a non drafting race it

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:07.690 
preparing for a non drafting race it
will<00:01:06.560> spend<00:01:06.799> a<00:01:06.860> bit<00:01:06.979> time<00:01:07.159> on<00:01:07.280> trial<00:01:07.490> trial

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:07.700 
will spend a bit time on trial trial

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:09.880 
will spend a bit time on trial trial
bike<00:01:07.909> but<00:01:08.659> the<00:01:09.049> biggest<00:01:09.350> difference<00:01:09.680> is<00:01:09.799> on

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:09.890 
bike but the biggest difference is on

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:11.169 
bike but the biggest difference is on
the<00:01:09.950> time<00:01:10.130> trial<00:01:10.340> bike<00:01:10.490> because<00:01:10.700> maybe<00:01:11.030> the

00:01:11.169 --> 00:01:11.179 
the time trial bike because maybe the

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:12.760 
the time trial bike because maybe the
saddle<00:01:11.479> a<00:01:11.539> little<00:01:11.840> bit<00:01:11.929> higher<00:01:12.109> but<00:01:12.499> not<00:01:12.679> an

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:12.770 
saddle a little bit higher but not an

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:15.819 
saddle a little bit higher but not an
awful<00:01:13.100> lot<00:01:13.280> maybe<00:01:13.460> a<00:01:13.729> centimeter<00:01:14.659> and<00:01:15.530> a<00:01:15.649> bit

00:01:15.819 --> 00:01:15.829 
awful lot maybe a centimeter and a bit

00:01:15.829 --> 00:01:17.859 
awful lot maybe a centimeter and a bit
further<00:01:16.009> forward<00:01:16.310> as<00:01:16.460> well<00:01:16.579> so<00:01:16.819> you<00:01:16.880> you<00:01:17.569> bring

00:01:17.859 --> 00:01:17.869 
further forward as well so you you bring

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:20.499 
further forward as well so you you bring
yourself<00:01:17.960> a<00:01:18.289> bit<00:01:18.469> further<00:01:18.679> forward<00:01:18.979> and<00:01:19.509> it

00:01:20.499 --> 00:01:20.509 
yourself a bit further forward and it

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:22.690 
yourself a bit further forward and it
helps<00:01:21.289> put<00:01:21.560> your<00:01:21.710> glutes<00:01:22.100> and<00:01:22.280> to<00:01:22.369> play<00:01:22.520> a<00:01:22.549> bit

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:22.700 
helps put your glutes and to play a bit

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:24.510 
helps put your glutes and to play a bit
more<00:01:22.880> for<00:01:23.090> a<00:01:23.119> bit<00:01:23.420> of<00:01:23.509> power<00:01:23.689> in<00:01:23.840> that<00:01:23.990> position

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:24.520 
more for a bit of power in that position

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:26.160 
more for a bit of power in that position
so<00:01:25.520> yeah<00:01:25.819> it's<00:01:25.939> been<00:01:25.969> interesting

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:26.170 
so yeah it's been interesting

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:29.319 
so yeah it's been interesting
experimenting<00:01:27.729> with<00:01:28.729> a<00:01:28.759> bit<00:01:28.909> more<00:01:29.060> time

00:01:29.319 --> 00:01:29.329 
experimenting with a bit more time

00:01:29.329 --> 00:01:30.849 
experimenting with a bit more time
traveling<00:01:29.749> and<00:01:29.960> spending<00:01:30.289> time<00:01:30.439> on<00:01:30.649> the<00:01:30.710> bike

00:01:30.849 --> 00:01:30.859 
traveling and spending time on the bike

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:33.099 
traveling and spending time on the bike
which<00:01:31.009> has<00:01:31.130> been<00:01:31.280> really<00:01:31.520> good<00:01:31.780> and<00:01:32.780> this<00:01:32.960> is<00:01:33.079> a

00:01:33.099 --> 00:01:33.109 
which has been really good and this is a

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:36.219 
which has been really good and this is a
really<00:01:33.619> fantastic<00:01:33.859> fast<00:01:34.520> bike<00:01:34.700> to<00:01:34.850> ride<00:01:35.049> so<00:01:36.049> my

00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:36.229 
really fantastic fast bike to ride so my

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:38.410 
really fantastic fast bike to ride so my
position<00:01:36.649> on<00:01:36.770> a<00:01:36.799> time<00:01:37.039> trial<00:01:37.249> bike<00:01:37.429> I<00:01:37.670> think

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:38.420 
position on a time trial bike I think

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:41.109 
position on a time trial bike I think
there's<00:01:38.539> a<00:01:38.600> few<00:01:38.749> things<00:01:39.020> to<00:01:39.109> look<00:01:39.259> for<00:01:39.499> I<00:01:40.219> think

00:01:41.109 --> 00:01:41.119 
there's a few things to look for I think

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:42.879 
there's a few things to look for I think
for<00:01:41.270> most<00:01:41.450> non<00:01:41.719> enough<00:01:41.929> drafting<00:01:42.409> triathlon

00:01:42.879 --> 00:01:42.889 
for most non enough drafting triathlon

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:44.620 
for most non enough drafting triathlon
if<00:01:43.280> we're<00:01:43.639> talking<00:01:43.759> about<00:01:43.909> longer<00:01:44.209> distant

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:44.630 
if we're talking about longer distant

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:46.300 
if we're talking about longer distant
things<00:01:44.810> half<00:01:45.049> I'm<00:01:45.289> an<00:01:45.530> Iron<00:01:45.709> Man<00:01:45.950> you<00:01:46.100> want

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:46.310 
things half I'm an Iron Man you want

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:47.499 
things half I'm an Iron Man you want
just<00:01:46.459> about<00:01:46.549> to<00:01:46.670> sit<00:01:46.850> on<00:01:46.969> the<00:01:47.030> bike<00:01:47.149> fairly

00:01:47.499 --> 00:01:47.509 
just about to sit on the bike fairly

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:48.609 
just about to sit on the bike fairly
comfortable<00:01:47.899> you<00:01:48.020> know<00:01:48.139> you're<00:01:48.259> not<00:01:48.350> going<00:01:48.560> to

00:01:48.609 --> 00:01:48.619 
comfortable you know you're not going to

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:52.120 
comfortable you know you're not going to
if<00:01:49.069> I<00:01:49.219> was<00:01:49.340> doing<00:01:49.549> a<00:01:49.670> say<00:01:50.270> a<00:01:50.299> tour<00:01:51.200> TT<00:01:51.709> of<00:01:51.889> an

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:52.130 
if I was doing a say a tour TT of an

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:54.160 
if I was doing a say a tour TT of an
hour<00:01:52.279> or<00:01:52.399> even<00:01:52.549> less<00:01:52.939> I'd<00:01:53.479> be<00:01:53.689> looking<00:01:53.959> for<00:01:53.990> a

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:54.170 
hour or even less I'd be looking for a

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:55.690 
hour or even less I'd be looking for a
really<00:01:54.469> extreme<00:01:54.799> position<00:01:55.130> aerodynamics

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:55.700 
really extreme position aerodynamics

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:58.179 
really extreme position aerodynamics
everything<00:01:56.060> but<00:01:56.299> it's<00:01:57.259> a<00:01:57.380> real<00:01:57.560> trade-off<00:01:58.069> I

00:01:58.179 --> 00:01:58.189 
everything but it's a real trade-off I

00:01:58.189 --> 00:02:00.219 
everything but it's a real trade-off I
think<00:01:58.429> in<00:01:58.579> triathlon<00:01:59.539> TT<00:01:59.899> between

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:00.229 
think in triathlon TT between

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:01.510 
think in triathlon TT between
aerodynamics<00:02:00.799> and<00:02:00.889> comfort<00:02:01.249> and<00:02:01.340> I<00:02:01.369> think

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:01.520 
aerodynamics and comfort and I think

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:02.379 
aerodynamics and comfort and I think
just<00:02:01.639> wanna<00:02:01.759> be<00:02:01.850> able<00:02:01.909> to<00:02:01.999> sit<00:02:02.149> on<00:02:02.179> the<00:02:02.299> bike

00:02:02.379 --> 00:02:02.389 
just wanna be able to sit on the bike

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:03.940 
just wanna be able to sit on the bike
quite<00:02:02.630> comfortably<00:02:03.049> and<00:02:03.619> so<00:02:03.740> that's<00:02:03.859> the

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:03.950 
quite comfortably and so that's the

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:05.769 
quite comfortably and so that's the
first<00:02:04.099> important<00:02:04.520> thing<00:02:04.549> and<00:02:04.909> like<00:02:05.359> I<00:02:05.479> said<00:02:05.539> it

00:02:05.769 --> 00:02:05.779 
first important thing and like I said it

00:02:05.779 --> 00:02:07.809 
first important thing and like I said it
I<00:02:05.990> try<00:02:06.649> to<00:02:06.709> kind<00:02:07.069> of<00:02:07.099> approximate<00:02:07.579> it<00:02:07.700> very

00:02:07.809 --> 00:02:07.819 
I try to kind of approximate it very

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:09.219 
I try to kind of approximate it very
much<00:02:07.939> my<00:02:08.149> Road<00:02:08.330> position<00:02:08.690> so<00:02:08.780> it<00:02:08.869> wasn't<00:02:09.080> a

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:09.229 
much my Road position so it wasn't a

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:10.990 
much my Road position so it wasn't a
massive<00:02:09.740> amount<00:02:09.950> off<00:02:10.130> so<00:02:10.429> just<00:02:10.700> by<00:02:10.819> lifting

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:11.000 
massive amount off so just by lifting

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.460 
massive amount off so just by lifting
the<00:02:11.240> side<00:02:11.420> a<00:02:11.450> little<00:02:11.540> bit<00:02:11.780> a<00:02:12.080> little<00:02:12.290> bit

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:12.470 
the side a little bit a little bit

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:13.630 
the side a little bit a little bit
further<00:02:12.650> forward<00:02:12.920> then<00:02:13.250> I<00:02:13.310> would<00:02:13.430> have<00:02:13.550> it

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640 
further forward then I would have it

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:15.340 
further forward then I would have it
normally<00:02:13.970> brings<00:02:14.569> me<00:02:14.720> a<00:02:14.750> bit<00:02:14.870> further<00:02:15.140> over

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:15.350 
normally brings me a bit further over

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:17.130 
normally brings me a bit further over
the<00:02:15.440> bottom<00:02:15.650> bracket<00:02:15.740> which<00:02:16.100> is<00:02:16.130> really<00:02:16.490> good

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 
the bottom bracket which is really good

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:19.690 
the bottom bracket which is really good
quite<00:02:18.140> a<00:02:18.170> big<00:02:18.500> drop-off<00:02:19.040> you<00:02:19.250> can<00:02:19.370> see<00:02:19.520> there

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:19.700 
quite a big drop-off you can see there

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:20.530 
quite a big drop-off you can see there
between<00:02:19.820> the<00:02:20.030> subtle<00:02:20.300> high

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:20.540 
between the subtle high

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:23.110 
between the subtle high
and<00:02:20.629> the<00:02:20.689> handlebars<00:02:21.220> but<00:02:22.220> not<00:02:22.430> so<00:02:22.730> much<00:02:22.970> that

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:23.120 
and the handlebars but not so much that

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.600 
and the handlebars but not so much that
it's<00:02:23.269> going<00:02:23.390> to<00:02:23.659> be<00:02:23.780> really<00:02:23.959> really<00:02:24.890> saw<00:02:25.250> to<00:02:25.310> do

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:25.610 
it's going to be really really saw to do

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:27.640 
it's going to be really really saw to do
to<00:02:26.239> find<00:02:26.420> easier<00:02:26.840> lower<00:02:27.140> back<00:02:27.409> and<00:02:27.560> your

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650 
to find easier lower back and your

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:28.990 
to find easier lower back and your
glutes<00:02:27.860> quite<00:02:28.069> a<00:02:28.099> lot<00:02:28.280> was<00:02:28.430> just<00:02:28.640> tough<00:02:28.849> when

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:29.000 
glutes quite a lot was just tough when

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.800 
glutes quite a lot was just tough when
you<00:02:29.060> get<00:02:29.209> up<00:02:29.540> to<00:02:30.019> run<00:02:30.590> and<00:02:30.860> I<00:02:31.790> quite<00:02:32.120> like<00:02:32.299> it<00:02:32.540> so

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:32.810 
you get up to run and I quite like it so

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:34.750 
you get up to run and I quite like it so
that<00:02:33.470> I'm<00:02:33.590> not<00:02:33.620> really<00:02:34.010> far<00:02:34.310> forward<00:02:34.610> you<00:02:34.670> know

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:34.760 
that I'm not really far forward you know

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:36.009 
that I'm not really far forward you know
you<00:02:34.819> see<00:02:35.030> some<00:02:35.209> people<00:02:35.390> and<00:02:35.689> their<00:02:35.810> time

00:02:36.009 --> 00:02:36.019 
you see some people and their time

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:37.690 
you see some people and their time
trailing<00:02:36.379> a<00:02:36.439> really<00:02:36.769> really<00:02:37.010> far<00:02:37.159> forward<00:02:37.459> I

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:37.700 
trailing a really really far forward I

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:40.390 
trailing a really really far forward I
don't<00:02:38.299> like<00:02:38.450> that<00:02:38.659> I<00:02:38.810> like<00:02:39.019> a<00:02:39.049> slightly<00:02:39.470> more

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:40.400 
don't like that I like a slightly more

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:41.920 
don't like that I like a slightly more
like<00:02:40.579> a<00:02:40.610> road<00:02:40.879> bike<00:02:41.120> position<00:02:41.540> I<00:02:41.629> suppose

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:41.930 
like a road bike position I suppose

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:45.160 
like a road bike position I suppose
which<00:02:42.890> is<00:02:43.040> comfortable<00:02:43.690> but<00:02:44.690> hopefully<00:02:45.049> one

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:45.170 
which is comfortable but hopefully one

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:46.809 
which is comfortable but hopefully one
that's<00:02:45.379> kind<00:02:45.590> of<00:02:45.620> quite<00:02:45.890> aerodynamic<00:02:46.519> as<00:02:46.670> well

00:02:46.809 --> 00:02:46.819 
that's kind of quite aerodynamic as well

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:49.149 
that's kind of quite aerodynamic as well
at<00:02:46.909> the<00:02:46.970> same<00:02:47.030> time<00:02:47.420> but<00:02:47.690> it<00:02:48.530> still<00:02:48.650> allows<00:02:48.980> you

00:02:49.149 --> 00:02:49.159 
at the same time but it still allows you

00:02:49.159 --> 00:02:52.390 
at the same time but it still allows you

which is really cool and it's just a

is really cool and really easy to get on
and<00:03:09.319> I<00:03:09.889> think<00:03:10.430> like<00:03:10.670> you're<00:03:10.790> seeing<00:03:10.970> with<00:03:11.090> a

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:11.120 
and I think like you're seeing with a

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:12.339 
and I think like you're seeing with a
lot<00:03:11.150> of<00:03:11.329> time<00:03:11.480> trial<00:03:11.690> helmets<00:03:11.959> recently

00:03:12.339 --> 00:03:12.349 
lot of time trial helmets recently

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:14.710 
lot of time trial helmets recently
they've<00:03:12.650> taken<00:03:12.859> the<00:03:13.190> the<00:03:13.790> tail<00:03:14.060> away<00:03:14.269> to<00:03:14.420> make

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:14.720 
they've taken the the tail away to make

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:17.830 
they've taken the the tail away to make
it<00:03:14.840> more<00:03:14.959> rounded<00:03:15.879> more<00:03:16.879> rounded<00:03:17.299> helmet<00:03:17.629> and

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:17.840 
it more rounded more rounded helmet and

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:19.149 
it more rounded more rounded helmet and
that's<00:03:18.049> all<00:03:18.200> to<00:03:18.349> do<00:03:18.470> with<00:03:18.620> how<00:03:18.709> the<00:03:18.769> air<00:03:18.950> comes

00:03:19.149 --> 00:03:19.159 
that's all to do with how the air comes

00:03:19.159 --> 00:03:20.259 
that's all to do with how the air comes
off<00:03:19.310> the<00:03:19.400> back<00:03:19.519> of<00:03:19.670> the<00:03:19.730> helmet<00:03:19.879> and<00:03:20.060> people

00:03:20.259 --> 00:03:20.269 
off the back of the helmet and people

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:22.059 
off the back of the helmet and people
now<00:03:20.810> realize<00:03:20.930> yeah<00:03:21.409> in<00:03:21.500> that<00:03:21.590> position<00:03:21.769> it's

00:03:22.059 --> 00:03:22.069 
now realize yeah in that position it's

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:25.750 
now realize yeah in that position it's
good<00:03:22.250> to<00:03:22.370> have<00:03:22.959> some<00:03:23.959> turbulent<00:03:24.500> air<00:03:24.650> at<00:03:25.639> the

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:25.760 
good to have some turbulent air at the

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:27.099 
good to have some turbulent air at the
back<00:03:25.910> of<00:03:26.060> your<00:03:26.150> head<00:03:26.329> because<00:03:26.810> it's<00:03:26.959> more

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:27.109 
back of your head because it's more

00:03:27.109 --> 00:03:29.080 
back of your head because it's more
aerodynamic<00:03:27.199> when<00:03:27.829> they're<00:03:28.040> the<00:03:28.639> flowing<00:03:29.000> air

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:29.090 
aerodynamic when they're the flowing air

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:31.270 
aerodynamic when they're the flowing air
goes<00:03:29.329> around<00:03:29.510> it<00:03:29.750> but<00:03:30.169> also<00:03:30.319> you<00:03:30.769> know<00:03:30.919> knowing

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:31.280 
goes around it but also you know knowing

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:32.140 
goes around it but also you know knowing
that<00:03:31.370> your<00:03:31.519> head's<00:03:31.669> going<00:03:31.849> to<00:03:31.910> be<00:03:31.970> in<00:03:32.060> all

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:32.150 
that your head's going to be in all

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:33.759 
that your head's going to be in all
kinds<00:03:32.389> of<00:03:32.449> position<00:03:32.840> you<00:03:32.959> spend<00:03:33.379> a<00:03:33.440> bit<00:03:33.560> time

00:03:33.759 --> 00:03:33.769 
kinds of position you spend a bit time

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:35.289 
kinds of position you spend a bit time
like<00:03:33.949> that<00:03:34.069> a<00:03:34.129> bit<00:03:34.370> time<00:03:34.609> at<00:03:34.760> different<00:03:35.000> angles

00:03:35.289 --> 00:03:35.299 
like that a bit time at different angles

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:37.330 
like that a bit time at different angles
and<00:03:35.419> stuff<00:03:35.510> and<00:03:35.750> I<00:03:35.780> think<00:03:36.069> without<00:03:37.069> the<00:03:37.160> tail

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:37.340 
and stuff and I think without the tail

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:39.849 
and stuff and I think without the tail
that<00:03:37.519> makes<00:03:37.669> a<00:03:37.819> bit<00:03:37.910> more<00:03:38.090> aerodynamic<00:03:38.859> it

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:39.859 
that makes a bit more aerodynamic it

00:03:39.859 --> 00:03:41.890 
that makes a bit more aerodynamic it
seems<00:03:40.040> to<00:03:40.220> work<00:03:40.250> well<00:03:41.030> as<00:03:41.209> well<00:03:41.389> as<00:03:41.540> in<00:03:41.660> photo

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:41.900 
seems to work well as well as in photo

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:43.750 
seems to work well as well as in photo
warm<00:03:42.079> conditions<00:03:42.319> is<00:03:42.739> even<00:03:43.489> though<00:03:43.609> it's

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:43.760 
warm conditions is even though it's

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:45.009 
warm conditions is even though it's
there's<00:03:44.150> no<00:03:44.269> vents<00:03:44.540> there's<00:03:44.870> good

00:03:45.009 --> 00:03:45.019 
there's no vents there's good

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:46.659 
there's no vents there's good
ventilation<00:03:45.290> and<00:03:45.889> air<00:03:46.160> comes<00:03:46.370> straight

00:03:46.659 --> 00:03:46.669 
ventilation and air comes straight

00:03:46.669 --> 00:03:48.580 
ventilation and air comes straight
around<00:03:46.760> you<00:03:46.970> from<00:03:47.690> the<00:03:47.780> top<00:03:47.900> of<00:03:48.079> your<00:03:48.169> head<00:03:48.319> and

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:48.590 
around you from the top of your head and

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:52.930 
around you from the top of your head and
it's<00:03:49.340> just<00:03:49.400> a<00:03:49.579> really<00:03:50.030> nice<00:03:50.180> travel<00:03:50.569> on<00:03:50.629> helmet
