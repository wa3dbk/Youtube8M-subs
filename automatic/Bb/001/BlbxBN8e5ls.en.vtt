when<00:00:10.890> you're<00:00:11.070> practicing<00:00:11.280> the<00:00:12.000> floating

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
when you're practicing the floating

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:17.929 
when you're practicing the floating
technique<00:00:12.870> a<00:00:13.230> good<00:00:13.860> way<00:00:14.040> to<00:00:14.100> do<00:00:14.460> it<00:00:14.610> is<00:00:16.939> just

00:00:17.929 --> 00:00:17.939 
technique a good way to do it is just

00:00:17.939 --> 00:00:21.740 
technique a good way to do it is just
try<00:00:18.410> just<00:00:19.410> try<00:00:19.650> to<00:00:19.710> keep<00:00:20.150> the<00:00:21.150> spindle<00:00:21.599> from

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
try just try to keep the spindle from

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.950 
try just try to keep the spindle from
popping<00:00:22.320> out<00:00:22.500> of<00:00:22.529> here<00:00:22.980> and<00:00:23.570> then<00:00:24.570> once<00:00:24.810> you

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
popping out of here and then once you

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.550 
popping out of here and then once you
can<00:00:25.110> do<00:00:25.320> that<00:00:26.570> put<00:00:27.570> your<00:00:27.750> hands<00:00:27.960> down<00:00:28.110> at<00:00:28.439> the

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
can do that put your hands down at the

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.580 
can do that put your hands down at the
bottom<00:00:28.800> and<00:00:29.310> try<00:00:29.759> to<00:00:29.820> float<00:00:30.180> your<00:00:30.360> hands<00:00:30.779> up<00:00:31.259> to

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
bottom and try to float your hands up to

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.160 
bottom and try to float your hands up to
the<00:00:31.619> top<00:00:32.009> I<00:00:32.480> always<00:00:33.480> use<00:00:33.690> the<00:00:33.899> floating

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
the top I always use the floating

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.920 
the top I always use the floating
technique<00:00:34.800> to<00:00:35.340> warm<00:00:35.610> up<00:00:35.850> a<00:00:36.000> set<00:00:36.270> but<00:00:36.510> sometimes

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
technique to warm up a set but sometimes

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.479 
technique to warm up a set but sometimes
I<00:00:37.110> need<00:00:37.170> just<00:00:37.500> a<00:00:37.620> little<00:00:37.649> bit<00:00:37.980> of<00:00:38.190> extra

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
I need just a little bit of extra

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:41.810 
I need just a little bit of extra
downward<00:00:39.390> pressure<00:00:39.750> to<00:00:40.410> get<00:00:40.649> the<00:00:40.800> coal<00:00:41.040> for<00:00:41.760> a

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
downward pressure to get the coal for a

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.010 
downward pressure to get the coal for a
more<00:00:42.030> difficult<00:00:42.240> set

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
more difficult set

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.660 
more difficult set
so<00:00:43.620> in<00:00:43.770> that<00:00:43.920> case<00:00:45.830> getting<00:00:46.830> the<00:00:47.040> set<00:00:47.280> really

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
so in that case getting the set really

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:53.540 
so in that case getting the set really
nice<00:00:47.850> and<00:00:48.120> warm<00:00:48.360> and<00:00:51.830> lot<00:00:52.830> sit<00:00:53.070> down<00:00:53.220> or

dust<00:02:15.209> and<00:02:15.420> I've<00:02:15.570> got<00:02:15.780> everything<00:02:16.080> nice<00:02:16.440> and

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
dust and I've got everything nice and

dust and I've got everything nice and
hot<00:02:16.860> I<00:02:17.190> can<00:02:18.060> speed<00:02:18.390> up<00:02:18.570> a<00:02:18.690> little<00:02:18.720> bit<00:02:19.110> a<00:02:19.530> little

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
hot I can speed up a little bit a little

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:34.310 
hot I can speed up a little bit a little
more<00:02:20.190> downward<00:02:20.580> pressure<00:02:32.120> and<00:02:33.230> there's<00:02:34.230> a

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:34.320 
more downward pressure and there's a

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:40.630 
more downward pressure and there's a
coal

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:40.640 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:43.900 

again<00:02:41.510> there's<00:02:41.750> no<00:02:41.930> need<00:02:41.960> to<00:02:42.230> rush<00:02:42.730> I'll<00:02:43.730> let
