00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:10.910
 hello how are you welcome to another 

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:13.369
 chapter of tips that day you come with 

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:15.709
 carla dÃ­az rÃºa today I'm going to show you 

00:00:13.369 --> 00:00:18.529
 how can you get those who 

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:21.470
 they have a little thicker nose already or 

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:23.630
 let's say how down you can achieve 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:25.850
 that you can see the thin nose and the 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:28.279
 already painted for that I'm going to use a 

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:30.920
 outline and this I do at the end of 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:32.570
 let's say the makeup after so 

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:34.220
 less after having applied my base 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:36.080
 Y 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:37.400
 and in this case, I have all the good 

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:39.200
 Make-up can be done at 

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:42.230
 final too if they want I 'm going to 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:45.620
 use my hula bronze hula the 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:47.770
 benefits already with this same same 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:50.870
 brush because it's ideal, I'm telling you 

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:52.970
 because I'm going to show you why it's good 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:55.280
 then for you to achieve that your 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:57.500
 nose for those who have the same nose 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:00.140
 I have my thin nose already but it is for 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:00.980
 show how you can do 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:06.940
 you have to apply 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:06.940
 let's say from the side of the nose 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:13.280
 thus 

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:13.280
 down 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:21.470
 already set already gave darkness and goodbye 

00:01:17.969 --> 00:01:25.270
 is already contouring 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:25.270
 on the other side we do the same 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:34.260
 always this way down there 

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:38.970
 that way you slim your nose 

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:41.490
 they notice that I kind of like this 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:43.710
 that effect 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:47.180
 this can be blurred already with the same 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.180
 with this same brush 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:57.350
 and now to give you the subject of 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:57.350
 we are going to apply here shadow 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:14.200
 applied true shadow and now we're going to 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:17.140
 apply luminosity already on the partition in 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:20.470
 this part yes to let give that 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:22.770
 nose destruction let's say more 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:25.040
 thin 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:27.240
 here they came to look for you better 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:30.090
 you can also blur with your 

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:32.100
 fingers already if they feel that it shows as 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:34.110
 very much let's say very marked it blur 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:36.420
 with your fingers now with a pencil 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:39.600
 micellar cut and I'm going to use my 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:41.819
 soft illuminator in crying mac this 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:44.400
 that is beautiful 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:46.460
 and with this fine finite pencil we are going to 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:49.030
 apply it 

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:51.590
 down 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:55.580
 then applied 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:58.000
 then we apply from the center towards 

00:02:55.580 --> 00:03:00.550
 down and with the same crime we blur 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.680
 more than anything to give that luminosity 

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:05.780
 natural that looks more natural than 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:08.150
 something else now if you want 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:10.640
 mark more applies more product but 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:13.210
 so it would normally be with this already 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:15.750
 Now I'm going to run a little here 

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:17.940
 to make it look a little more 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:20.460
 can also blur say with the 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:23.110
 finger already to give it a termination a 

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:25.810
 slightly softer 

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:28.570
 but that is here below true us side and 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:32.860
 there is an aspect of no one is more 

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:35.770
 good right if you see it from afar with a 

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:37.350
 in your mirror so far away with light they go 

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:40.240
 to be able to account that you see the nose 

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:41.950
 given that thinner nose effect like that 

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:43.840
 how good I hope you liked this 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:45.490
 type then you can use you 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:47.500
 also in their makeup when they want 

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:50.500
 slim your nose now who have 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:52.390
 the nose a little bit much like that but very 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:56.690
 finite and that was the best thing that you can not see 

00:03:52.390 --> 00:04:00.260
 so finite apply let's say more 

00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:03.440
 the bronze is applied in the center and 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:05.840
 for that effect like nose do not 

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:08.030
 do on the sides do not apply a 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:10.490
 outline already but in center itch 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:14.680
 bronzer to see the nose not so 

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:17.540
 thin already so those girls I hope 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:20.239

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:22.370
