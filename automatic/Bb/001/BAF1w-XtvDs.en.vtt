00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.730
 That's the way it says, I'm a rodrigo and in that 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:10.980
 video I'll show you some 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:14.549
 videos and photos that I've done with 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:20.630
 the nokia lumia 620 camera and has 5 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:20.630
 megapixels and makes videos at 720p deserves 

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:26.550
 You are now watching me on video. 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.199
 I made that city an end of afternoon and 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.929
 impression I had is that the camera gives 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:32.880
 darkened in the image, what makes the 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:35.430
 Sun seemed a bit weaker than 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.719
 he really was on time but still 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.969
 so the video seemed to have a 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:42.000
 reasonable quality has spread 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:44.899
 such devices as laws where 36 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.899
 but some stretches there 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:18.800
 in relation to the photos first I 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:20.600
 I make it very clear that I am not a 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:22.700
 scorer of the technical terms of the 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:24.680
 photography or anything of the sort 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:27.020
 so that's what me even lay print 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:29.900
 I thought in ideal situations 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:32.960
 that is to say an enlightened environment 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:35.810
 light behind the camera the 620 makes pictures 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:38.320
 very very good you are already 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:38.320
 seeing 

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:59.560
 in low light environments and I noticed that 

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:01.840
 their flash was able to do the 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:06.450
 extremely basic that is to let 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:06.450
 visible objects nothing much more 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:21.040
 I did not expect much from photos. 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:22.590
 and it does not really make the 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:24.940
 image is with the graduation level 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:27.480
 considerable and in these cases there is no 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:27.480
 so much to do 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:43.810
 I izzo that the camera of the lumiar 620 m 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:44.980
 pleased because in many situations it is 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:46.959
 capable of taking quality photos 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:48.760
 higher than I imagined 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:51.700
 I did not test with the front camera 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:53.950
 because it is very basic vga resolution 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:56.320
 and serves only for video calls and 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:58.360
 things of this kind through images that 

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:59.890
 I showed here in higher resolution is just 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:02.590
 click the album link that I left 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:04.420
 just below the video in the description 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:06.160
 I hope you enjoyed this test if 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:07.840
 you liked people click liked 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:09.610
 This is the first time here on the channel 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:11.380
 write that you will follow the 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:12.670
 coming on video on youtube 

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:15.930
 I'm going to stay here from heart to 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:15.930
 You guys said that
