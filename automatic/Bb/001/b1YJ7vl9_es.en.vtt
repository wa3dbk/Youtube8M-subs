00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.819
 hello to all and welcome to this 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:07.259
 new video that will deal with 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:08.160
 some omissions I made on 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:10.410
 Minecraft 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:13.080
 and lastly, forgetting the link 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.910
 so modifies that kraft like that it costs 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.460
 expensive it's eight diamond blocks and one 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.730
 golden bug but frankly it's worth it 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.580
 trouble 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.410
 so how does it work well i'm going 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.260
 show you something interesting 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.550
 finally we will create a link loop I 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.970
 will do it I'm going to make several 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:33.120
 games make one here in height and we're going 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.649
 destroy the basic platform to the game there 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:38.219
 there is a little bit there is not too good 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:41.910
 serious we will make a game it's not 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:43.770
 me here it will be fine and you 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.250
 go see it's really nice 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:49.070
 this block offers us several options 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:57.030
 firstly we can rename as a 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:58.079
 as with an airlock and we will say author 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.140
 since it's the one I did in 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:04.530
 router that's it and we can put it 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:06.810
 also options to as intra 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.220
 linking so the intra linking that is 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.970
 that it does 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.979
 that will allow you to be able to serve the 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:16.380
 I will show you right away 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:17.310
 use this book in the same world in 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.140
 which you are 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:23.189
 and with that you can also put 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:24.930
 following that will allow you to 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:27.780
 see that gives him a little aura at the 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:30.090
 said m and that's why you 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.310
 teleport uses it drop and the book at 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:35.220
 ground and in the same world through a 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.600
 transvestite therefore wing intra intra liquid 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.610
 that's why it was deported to 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.829
 same world and following it is for not 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.390
 lose the book so that's good 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:45.540
 now there are other things 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:47.399
 like this one we'll put him too 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.229
 following and we will put him generated 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.970
 platform so what will be the 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:53.009
 difference 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:55.500
 well it will generate a small block in 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:57.509
 below you to prevent that by 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:00.450
 example if someone destroys the one and 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:02.520
 well so two blocks below you 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:04.430
 can you have a block that you 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.420
 will prevent from dying if someone put 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:09.440
 a hole below you for example 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:11.220
 so that's a small security 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:13.200
 pretty friendly game 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:15.420
 what else now we have 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.400
 other things a little more embarrassing or 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:20.190
 not so we will use the book that will 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:21.960
 up there and we will put maintained 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:23.100
 mammoth or so that I know more 

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:26.670
 exactly what I believe it is 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:28.740
 that's it no no no it's because it 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:29.880
 just rightly understood yet I'm going 

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:33.210
 go see on the wiki i'm just going 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:36.090
 show you before one of the others 

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:39.120
 options that is the ten weapons 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:41.390
 so that's it if you use an art book 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:45.990
 like that so it's a trapped goat 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:47.880
 here you will not die however at the 

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:49.980
 no one is thick at the place where he 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:51.570
 meant the ebook the person lets go 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.709
 book is finally here I push in 

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:54.360
 inventory actually at the place where she 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:54.930
 used it so it can be used 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:58.860
 for a trap 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:03:00.209
 this is so it's good to know so 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:02.280
 pay attention to the books you 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:04.380
 use and give you or you 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:07.050
 find to avoid any problem 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:08.910
 check them in lincolnshire I 

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:10.230
 am just going to check this is that what 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:14.670
 it's this option and I'm coming back to 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:16.440
 you ok so the men times ntoum activate 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:19.470
 or not actually it's relative to 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:22.200
 toes so it would be that when we put 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:26.930
 in a portal that is well maintained 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:30.510
 all objects would keep their speed 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:32.040
 of moving all that they have 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:33.030
 when they are sent to the portal 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:34.230
 so if we send with a dee spencer 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:38.160
 something like that I'm doing 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:39.930
 tests this not very conclusive so we 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:42.510
 will try to see some tips maybe 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:44.130
 things like that for future tutorial 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:46.560
 but one but for now it's 

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:48.600
 really not conclusive of what I saw 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:52.080
 good in any case you have learned to 

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:53.820
 to make books that you can 

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:57.630
 use a little bit of how to help 

00:03:53.820 --> 00:04:00.120
 slash to may on the servers and that's 

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:03.810
 already handy I think but here it is 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:05.430
 so I hope you enjoyed it that you 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:08.180
 have taken things and I tell you to the 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:08.180
 next hi
