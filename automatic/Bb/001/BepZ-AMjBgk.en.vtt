00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.700
 hello in this video I'm going to show you the 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:09.599
 analysis of the rom cyanogenmod 10 light 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:12.090
 version 1.3 well this is a rom that is 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:15.450
 a modification of how well your 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:18.390
 name cyanogenmod 10 or yale bing for 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:20.460
 our samsung galaxy 6 this rom brings 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.340
 enough improvements and enough 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:25.109
 differences visually none but 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.660
 internally it does bring enough 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:29.880
 some of the most important ones as well 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.980
 mentioned is that it brings enough 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:35.160
 storage available more than the one 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:38.250
 it brings by default cyanogenmod 10 also 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:40.590
 brings some deleted applications and 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:43.200
 they have also directly implemented the 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.210
 Google apps so you do not have to install 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.430
 separate them directly from the flower 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.989
 mod recovery 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.940
 I wanted to mention other small details 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:52.620
 like the link to download the rom 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.289
 what are you going to have there in the description 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.579
 as I always do, you are also going to have 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:58.920
 the link to a tutorial in which 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:01.770
 I explain in a simple and quick way how 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.780
 how to install this rom and good now what 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.460
 what we are going to do is basically see your 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.570
 performance its operation and its 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.550
 stability 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:11.420
 although I wanted to tell you that it's never going to 

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:14.400
 be the same fluidity stability 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:16.260
 performance battery life and everything 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:19.770
 the rest is never going to be the same as a 

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:21.690
 rom based on android 2.3 so to 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.520
 Although it moves quite fluid, it does not 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:25.729
 I recommend it for daily use os 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:28.680
 I recommend that you try it if you want and 

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:29.970
 little more but if you want a rom for the 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.130
 Daily use to make the most of 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:34.920
 your phone I recommend some 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:38.130
 based on android 2.3 gingerbread either 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:40.520
 stock or cyanogen 7 or something for the 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:43.350
 style let's start with the analysis 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:45.930
 Well, I've already been testing it 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:48.330
 time and as I say is the worst the worst 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:50.789
 worst of all is the duration of 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:53.910
 battery as you see here we can already 

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:55.500
 directly directly from him from 

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:58.020
 the lock screen access google 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:00.710
 now access the camera or access 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.710
 to unlock 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:07.829
 this rom is based on the version 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:10.440
 cyanogenmod 10 knightley 3 removed 

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:13.019
 a version a later version the 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:16.680
 night l 4 but this one is based on the 

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:19.549
 On Sunday, September 30, therefore, no 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:22.440
 is the most current has some small 

00:02:19.549 --> 00:02:24.510
 failures because I tell you that it is a version 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:26.849
 in development is not a stable version 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:28.590
 and final and nothing like that but good 

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:30.750
 let's see the available storage 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:33.000
 what it brings us if we are going to administer 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:35.630
 Applications 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.630
 here we 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:39.379
 let's all downloaded and how 

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:41.209
 you see 

00:02:39.379 --> 00:02:43.879
 I have installed neither application nor 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:49.099
 nothing like that and it tells us that we 

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:50.959
 brings 109 110 megabytes available for the 

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:53.540
 storage let's start to see a 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:57.290
 little the interface I tell you that it is quite 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:59.160
 fluid is a good thing from the roms based 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:00.930
 on jelly bean 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:02.040
 as you see moves without any problem 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:05.160
 let's start to see the applications 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:07.260
 that brings brings the adjustments that are the 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:09.900
 that I was bringing, we do not have 10 as you see 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:11.819
 we have a small new section of 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:13.709
 bills 

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:15.180
 and it moves pretty fluid if we go 

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:18.150
 to phone information we see that 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:22.799
 we have android 4.1.1 I am going to mention 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:25.019
 the little mistakes ebooks that has 

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:27.940
 this rom are the following 

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:31.830
 first of all he does not work 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:34.060
 the wifi would yield that is to configure 

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:37.240
 our phone in case we have 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:41.560
 some 3g network so to share this 

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:44.350
 Internet with others with other phones or 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:48.370
 with other devices does not work either 

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:51.280
 him when we connect the usb to 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:53.800
 transfer data from the phone to 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:55.900
 the computer does not work that does not work 

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:58.360
 the video playback on high 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:00.310
 definition on youtube that not even 

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:02.650
 brings us the installed application and 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:05.050
 neither does it work finally this is such 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:08.860
 time maybe the most important mistake the 

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:10.480
 camera the camera as you see not even 

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:13.090
 bring us camera application 

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:15.910
 we would have to access from their own 

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:18.870
 from the screen lock itself and 

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:18.870
 good this camera 

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:24.670
 What happens is that as you can see, there is no 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:24.670
 error 

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:31.050
 so how does the camera work? 

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:33.240
 the error that he gave us is that what is 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:35.550
 the preview of taking pictures 

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:38.340
 and such works perfectly what does not 

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:40.860
 it works when it comes to taking video or 

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:43.200
 Take pictures of even the photos 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:44.850
 panoramic so instead of bringing 

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:46.140
 a useless camera application that does not 

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:48.360
 It will work for us because they have decided 

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:50.610
 eliminate it and they saved a little bit of 

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:53.010
 internal storage we're going like this now 

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:55.770
 if we start with the applications that we 

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:58.140
 come adjustments already shown apolo is 

00:04:55.770 --> 00:05:01.020
 the music application of all these 

00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:04.610
 Android versions after 2.3 

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:04.610
 bring us the calculator 

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:08.990
 that go has given us an error I say is 

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:10.850
 a developing version we have 

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:13.900
 that accustom these errors to these 

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:17.690
 forced closures and so on calendar 

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:19.430
 As you can see, it jumps with this effect to 

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:22.370
 enter applications that is quite 

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:27.510
 nice the phone 

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:30.710
 As you can see, the transition is very good 

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:30.710
 the contacts 

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:35.330
 run or downloads 

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:38.580
 the photo gallery 

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:45.150
 as you can see it works fluid 

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:55.310
 the google the google search that 

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:58.819
 would be what it would be google does not work 

00:05:55.310 --> 00:06:01.039
 but when detecting us the voice that is another 

00:05:58.819 --> 00:06:03.110
 error does not work for us what is the 

00:06:01.039 --> 00:06:05.720
 voice detection as you see sends us to 

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:08.330
 the google configurations now what 

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:11.120
 is to search in google now of the own 

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:12.590
 google now as if searching for 

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:14.479
 normal google and current it was 

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:16.970
 what works does not work as I say it is 

00:06:14.479 --> 00:06:19.639
 when trying to search with our 

00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:22.819
 voice jumps us an error you do not understand 

00:06:19.639 --> 00:06:24.729
 I did not understand it, so as you 

00:06:22.819 --> 00:06:27.110
 I say are errors that will be corrected 

00:06:24.729 --> 00:06:29.300
 bring messages and I take advantage of 

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:33.849
 show you the keyboard brings the keyboard of 

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:36.459
 yale bing is quite useful is very fast 

00:06:33.849 --> 00:06:39.279
 it does not even work here this is 

00:06:36.459 --> 00:06:41.439
 a shame because the keyboard itself 

00:06:39.279 --> 00:06:42.849
 yale wines allow dictating ya 

00:06:41.439 --> 00:06:45.039
 as we are dictating we are going 

00:06:42.849 --> 00:06:47.979
 appearing the words the browser is 

00:06:45.039 --> 00:06:50.980
 also pretty fluid let's wait 

00:06:47.979 --> 00:06:54.100
 to access 

00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:56.830
 my google account to enter 

00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:59.670
 look for anything and so be able to try 

00:06:56.830 --> 00:06:59.670
 the fluidity of this 

00:07:01.710 --> 00:07:08.340
 We wait for you to charge what is wifi 3g 

00:07:05.090 --> 00:07:11.180
 the accelerometer and all what are the 

00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:13.380
 sensors and others work well the rom 

00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:15.660
 within what does not fit is not 

00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:18.690
 incomplete what you have is therefore 

00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:21.000
 like any other version any 

00:07:18.690 --> 00:07:24.300
 rom based on our versions that do not 

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:26.880
 is very complete basically because the 

00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:28.800
 the manufacturers themselves in this case by 

00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:31.740
 example of samsung as they have not released 

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:34.500
 all the drivers since officially 

00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:35.640
 this rom this this android version is not 

00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:37.050
 It is available for this phone 

00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:40.020
 so that's why they do not have 

00:07:37.050 --> 00:07:41.610
 released the traders and good the rest 

00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:44.100
 of applications that are the play store the 

00:07:41.610 --> 00:07:46.200
 watch super sims ' user services since 

00:07:44.100 --> 00:07:50.100
 the emulator terminal is already surrounded 

00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:52.530
 the voice search of the version of 

00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:55.230
 android 2.3 the search application 

00:07:52.530 --> 00:07:56.820
 android voice of android 2.3 what are 

00:07:55.230 --> 00:07:59.270
 the widgets and so on work to the 

00:07:56.820 --> 00:08:03.060
 perfection so if you want a rom 

00:07:59.270 --> 00:08:04.680
 based on 4.1 that has a little bit more 

00:08:03.060 --> 00:08:07.350
 of internal storage available that 

00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:09.210
 the official and to prove it and such the 

00:08:07.350 --> 00:08:09.690
 I recommend for daily use not the 

00:08:09.210 --> 00:08:13.760
 I recommend 

00:08:09.690 --> 00:08:13.760
 thanks for watching this video until another
