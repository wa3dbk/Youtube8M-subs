cardboard so here's the case and already

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.130 
cardboard so here's the case and already
it<00:00:59.640> actually<00:01:00.120> feels<00:01:00.329> like<00:01:00.629> really<00:01:01.020> really

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
it actually feels like really really

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.549 
it actually feels like really really
high<00:01:01.410> quality<00:01:01.850> plastic<00:01:02.930> it's<00:01:03.930> not<00:01:04.080> flexible

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
high quality plastic it's not flexible

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.480 
high quality plastic it's not flexible
but<00:01:05.309> has<00:01:05.909> kind<00:01:06.210> of<00:01:06.270> a<00:01:06.360> cold<00:01:06.689> touch<00:01:07.020> to<00:01:07.229> it<00:01:07.490> not

but has kind of a cold touch to it not
really<00:01:08.790> I'm<00:01:09.479> thinking<00:01:10.140> this<00:01:10.229> is<00:01:10.409> plastic<00:01:10.920> but

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.980 
really I'm thinking this is plastic but
it<00:01:11.100> kind<00:01:11.400> of<00:01:11.460> feels<00:01:11.610> like<00:01:11.850> aluminum<00:01:13.010> not<00:01:14.010> sure

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
does have a cold touch to it so it may

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.679

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:15.270 
annoy me but it may annoy you these snap
on<00:02:13.240> cases<00:02:13.480> aren't<00:02:13.780> really<00:02:14.050> for<00:02:14.470> huge

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280 
on cases aren't really for huge

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:17.070 
on cases aren't really for huge
protection<00:02:15.850> because<00:02:15.940> I<00:02:16.120> you<00:02:16.510> can<00:02:16.690> see<00:02:16.870> on<00:02:16.990> the

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:17.080 
protection because I you can see on the

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:19.470 
protection because I you can see on the
bottom<00:02:17.260> it's<00:02:17.980> not<00:02:18.190> really<00:02:18.370> covered<00:02:18.850> so<00:02:19.090> if<00:02:19.300> it

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.480 
bottom it's not really covered so if it

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:20.940 
bottom it's not really covered so if it
falls<00:02:19.720> it<00:02:19.990> could<00:02:20.170> still<00:02:20.410> crack<00:02:20.620> the<00:02:20.770> screen

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:20.950 
falls it could still crack the screen

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:22.890 
falls it could still crack the screen
but<00:02:21.640> these<00:02:21.790> cases<00:02:22.210> are<00:02:22.390> just<00:02:22.600> for<00:02:22.780> like

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:22.900 
but these cases are just for like

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:26.130 
but these cases are just for like
