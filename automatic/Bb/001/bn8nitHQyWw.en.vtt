00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.300 

in<00:00:00.299> this<00:00:00.960> video<00:00:01.260> I'll<00:00:01.530> show<00:00:01.709> off<00:00:01.829> some<00:00:02.070> of<00:00:02.100> the

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:02.310 
in this video I'll show off some of the

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:05.329 
in this video I'll show off some of the
changes<00:00:02.669> for<00:00:02.850> overgrowth<00:00:03.270> alpha<00:00:03.750> 113<00:00:04.710> which

00:00:05.329 --> 00:00:05.339 
changes for overgrowth alpha 113 which

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:08.419 
changes for overgrowth alpha 113 which
you<00:00:05.460> can<00:00:05.609> try<00:00:05.790> if<00:00:05.970> you<00:00:06.060> pre-ordered<00:00:07.429> first

00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:08.429 
you can try if you pre-ordered first

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:10.160 
you can try if you pre-ordered first
there<00:00:08.910> are<00:00:09.000> some<00:00:09.120> new<00:00:09.240> sounds<00:00:09.450> for<00:00:09.809> the<00:00:09.840> weapon

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:10.170 
there are some new sounds for the weapon

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:14.120 
there are some new sounds for the weapon
drops<00:00:11.780> the<00:00:12.780> weapon<00:00:13.049> still<00:00:13.259> share<00:00:13.500> a<00:00:13.530> sound<00:00:13.860> set

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
drops the weapon still share a sound set

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.439 
drops the weapon still share a sound set
that<00:00:14.460> is<00:00:14.549> pitch<00:00:14.759> shifted<00:00:15.179> based<00:00:15.389> on<00:00:15.570> this<00:00:17.449> but

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
that is pitch shifted based on this but

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:19.790 
that is pitch shifted based on this but
this<00:00:18.630> should<00:00:18.779> at<00:00:18.869> least<00:00:18.990> give<00:00:19.230> the<00:00:19.350> metallic

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
this should at least give the metallic

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.790 
this should at least give the metallic
feeling<00:00:20.160> for<00:00:20.340> now<00:00:21.140> soon<00:00:22.140> we<00:00:22.260> should<00:00:22.320> have<00:00:22.529> some

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
feeling for now soon we should have some

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.800 
feeling for now soon we should have some
more<00:00:22.980> specific<00:00:23.189> weapon<00:00:23.789> sounds<00:00:24.180> to<00:00:24.449> clarify

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
more specific weapon sounds to clarify

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:26.359 
more specific weapon sounds to clarify
materials<00:00:25.470> and<00:00:25.710> shape<00:00:25.859> better

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
materials and shape better

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.439 
materials and shape better
I<00:00:27.800> also<00:00:28.800> added<00:00:29.160> an<00:00:29.400> initial<00:00:29.820> test<00:00:30.029> for<00:00:30.359> the

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
I also added an initial test for the

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.540 
I also added an initial test for the
sound<00:00:30.689> system<00:00:31.109> for<00:00:31.470> weapons<00:00:31.800> moving<00:00:31.980> to<00:00:32.309> air

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
sound system for weapons moving to air

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.540 
sound system for weapons moving to air
this<00:00:33.390> is<00:00:33.540> usually<00:00:33.719> pretty<00:00:34.110> subtle<00:00:34.350> but<00:00:34.680> it

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
this is usually pretty subtle but it

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.180 
this is usually pretty subtle but it
will<00:00:35.670> be<00:00:35.820> more<00:00:36.000> obvious<00:00:36.390> with<00:00:36.540> actual<00:00:36.930> attacks

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:40.190 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:43.040 

and<00:00:41.190> it<00:00:41.309> makes<00:00:41.489> it<00:00:42.000> a<00:00:42.120> lot<00:00:42.239> more<00:00:42.300> fun<00:00:42.629> to<00:00:42.840> fling

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
and it makes it a lot more fun to fling

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:53.270 
and it makes it a lot more fun to fling
the<00:00:43.079> weapons

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.740 

another<00:00:54.280> new<00:00:54.489> sound<00:00:54.730> effect<00:00:55.030> is<00:00:55.329> sliding

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:55.750 
another new sound effect is sliding

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:58.170 
another new sound effect is sliding
after<00:00:56.260> landing<00:00:56.620> from<00:00:56.710> a<00:00:56.829> jump<00:00:56.860> if<00:00:57.790> you<00:00:57.970> land

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:58.180 
after landing from a jump if you land

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:00.270 
after landing from a jump if you land
from<00:00:58.360> a<00:00:58.449> horizontal<00:00:58.720> jump<00:00:59.260> you<00:00:59.410> usually<00:00:59.770> slide

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:00.280 
from a horizontal jump you usually slide

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:02.130 
from a horizontal jump you usually slide
for<00:01:00.610> several<00:01:00.940> feet<00:01:01.120> so<00:01:01.360> it<00:01:01.449> seems<00:01:01.690> silly<00:01:01.870> not

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:02.140 
for several feet so it seems silly not

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:10.800 
for several feet so it seems silly not
to<00:01:02.170> have<00:01:02.350> any<00:01:02.470> sound<00:01:02.710> for<00:01:02.920> that<00:01:02.949> I<00:01:09.810> also

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:10.810 
to have any sound for that I also

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:12.510 
to have any sound for that I also
experimented<00:01:11.440> a<00:01:11.530> bit<00:01:11.560> with<00:01:11.860> making<00:01:12.100> night

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:12.520 
experimented a bit with making night

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:14.580 
experimented a bit with making night
scenes<00:01:12.850> the<00:01:13.300> sky<00:01:13.540> here<00:01:13.810> is<00:01:13.930> adapted<00:01:14.410> from<00:01:14.500> the

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:14.590 
scenes the sky here is adapted from the

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:16.680 
scenes the sky here is adapted from the

Observatory<00:01:17.470> which<00:01:17.920> has<00:01:18.100> a<00:01:18.130> really<00:01:18.430> nice<00:01:18.550> view

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:18.880 
Observatory which has a really nice view

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:20.999 
Observatory which has a really nice view
of<00:01:19.060> the<00:01:19.090> Milky<00:01:19.420> Way<00:01:19.720> I'm<00:01:20.170> also<00:01:20.440> trying<00:01:20.770> out<00:01:20.979> a

00:01:20.999 --> 00:01:21.009 
of the Milky Way I'm also trying out a

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:22.590 
of the Milky Way I'm also trying out a
post-processing<00:01:21.700> shader<00:01:22.060> for<00:01:22.330> the<00:01:22.450> night

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:22.600 
post-processing shader for the night

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:24.779 
post-processing shader for the night
levels<00:01:23.020> to<00:01:23.710> simulate<00:01:23.920> some<00:01:24.280> of<00:01:24.310> the<00:01:24.490> effects

00:01:24.779 --> 00:01:24.789 
levels to simulate some of the effects

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:26.609 
levels to simulate some of the effects
of<00:01:24.910> darkness<00:01:25.300> without<00:01:25.750> actually<00:01:26.259> making<00:01:26.440> it

00:01:26.609 --> 00:01:26.619 
of darkness without actually making it

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:28.170 
of darkness without actually making it
too<00:01:26.770> dark<00:01:26.950> this<00:01:27.369> shader<00:01:27.670> doesn't<00:01:28.060> actually

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:28.180 
too dark this shader doesn't actually

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:30.240 
too dark this shader doesn't actually
make<00:01:28.479> it<00:01:28.600> harder<00:01:28.840> to<00:01:28.960> play<00:01:29.200> but<00:01:29.830> it<00:01:29.950> gives<00:01:30.130> the

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:30.250 
make it harder to play but it gives the

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:31.859 
make it harder to play but it gives the
impression<00:01:30.340> of<00:01:30.910> straining<00:01:31.330> to<00:01:31.539> see<00:01:31.570> in<00:01:31.780> the

00:01:31.859 --> 00:01:31.869 
impression of straining to see in the

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:37.290 
impression of straining to see in the
dark<00:01:35.130> the<00:01:36.130> last<00:01:36.340> new<00:01:36.490> feature<00:01:36.550> I'm<00:01:36.910> working<00:01:37.210> on

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:37.300 
dark the last new feature I'm working on

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:40.080 
dark the last new feature I'm working on
is<00:01:37.600> an<00:01:37.750> active<00:01:38.170> ragdoll<00:01:38.680> system<00:01:39.100> I've<00:01:39.910> only

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:40.090 
is an active ragdoll system I've only

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:41.790 
is an active ragdoll system I've only
just<00:01:40.240> started<00:01:40.720> on<00:01:40.810> this<00:01:40.960> so<00:01:41.380> all<00:01:41.500> we<00:01:41.590> can<00:01:41.679> do

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:41.800 
just started on this so all we can do

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:43.050 
just started on this so all we can do
for<00:01:41.830> now<00:01:42.100> is<00:01:42.130> go<00:01:42.399> through<00:01:42.429> his<00:01:42.700> normal

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:43.060 
for now is go through his normal

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:45.510 
for now is go through his normal
animations<00:01:43.570> by<00:01:43.960> the<00:01:44.020> ragdoll<00:01:44.710> form<00:01:44.979> for

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:45.520 
animations by the ragdoll form for

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:47.730 
animations by the ragdoll form for
example<00:01:45.940> here's<00:01:46.119> his<00:01:46.420> combat<00:01:46.899> stance<00:01:47.229> the

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:47.740 
example here's his combat stance the

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:49.770 
example here's his combat stance the
physics<00:01:48.100> make<00:01:48.310> him<00:01:48.490> flop<00:01:48.880> over<00:01:49.240> but<00:01:49.570> he<00:01:49.630> keeps

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:49.780 
physics make him flop over but he keeps

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:52.169 
physics make him flop over but he keeps
his<00:01:49.929> guard<00:01:50.259> pose<00:01:50.500> and<00:01:50.979> even<00:01:51.250> keeps<00:01:51.729> bouncing

00:01:52.169 --> 00:01:52.179 
his guard pose and even keeps bouncing

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:53.969 
his guard pose and even keeps bouncing
his<00:01:52.270> legs<00:01:52.479> up<00:01:52.630> and<00:01:52.780> down<00:01:52.840> like<00:01:53.200> he<00:01:53.500> did<00:01:53.679> in<00:01:53.830> his

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:53.979 
his legs up and down like he did in his

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:56.040 
his legs up and down like he did in his
combat<00:01:54.429> stance<00:01:54.729> and<00:01:55.209> here's<00:01:55.509> his<00:01:55.690> walk

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:56.050 
combat stance and here's his walk

00:01:56.050 --> 00:02:01.410 
combat stance and here's his walk
animation<00:01:59.520> he's<00:02:00.520> not<00:02:00.670> going<00:02:00.910> anywhere<00:02:01.000> past

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:01.420 
animation he's not going anywhere past

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:03.120 
animation he's not going anywhere past
this<00:02:01.690> way<00:02:01.869> but<00:02:02.319> you<00:02:02.410> can<00:02:02.530> tell<00:02:02.709> that<00:02:02.920> the

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:03.130 
this way but you can tell that the

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:05.010 
this way but you can tell that the
physics<00:02:03.550> are<00:02:03.670> working<00:02:04.030> I<00:02:04.209> can<00:02:04.599> apply<00:02:04.780> any

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:05.020 
physics are working I can apply any

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:06.990 
physics are working I can apply any
animation<00:02:05.560> like<00:02:05.709> this<00:02:05.739> like<00:02:06.340> his<00:02:06.489> old<00:02:06.670> sweep

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:07.000 
animation like this like his old sweep

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.240 
animation like this like his old sweep
reaction<00:02:07.539> makes<00:02:07.959> him<00:02:08.170> kind<00:02:08.380> of<00:02:08.470> flop<00:02:09.069> over
