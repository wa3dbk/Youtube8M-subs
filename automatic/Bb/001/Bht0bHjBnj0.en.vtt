00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:06.060 
hi I'm Oscar fan Dave hunter and these

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:08.240 
hi I'm Oscar fan Dave hunter and these
are<00:00:06.240> the<00:00:06.359> sphere<00:00:06.629> gears<00:00:06.990> at<00:00:07.740> the<00:00:07.890> end<00:00:07.980> of<00:00:08.099> this

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:08.250 
are the sphere gears at the end of this

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:10.910 
are the sphere gears at the end of this
video<00:00:08.400> I<00:00:08.610> have<00:00:08.970> a<00:00:09.030> question<00:00:09.809> to<00:00:09.990> you<00:00:10.139> asking

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:10.920 
video I have a question to you asking

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.030 
video I have a question to you asking
your<00:00:11.070> opinion<00:00:11.160> so<00:00:11.910> if<00:00:12.540> you<00:00:12.900> watch<00:00:13.590> the<00:00:13.769> video

your opinion so if you watch the video

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.730 
your opinion so if you watch the video
perhaps<00:00:14.429> you<00:00:14.759> can<00:00:15.030> tell<00:00:15.990> me<00:00:16.170> your<00:00:16.320> opinion

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
perhaps you can tell me your opinion

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.550 
perhaps you can tell me your opinion
after<00:00:16.980> seeing<00:00:17.520> this<00:00:17.640> video<00:00:17.930> the<00:00:18.930> sphere<00:00:19.199> gears

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
after seeing this video the sphere gears

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.060 
after seeing this video the sphere gears
is<00:00:19.949> an<00:00:20.160> ID<00:00:20.340> by<00:00:20.699> Bram<00:00:21.119> Cohen<00:00:21.330> it's<00:00:21.779> a<00:00:22.109> mechanical

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
is an ID by Bram Cohen it's a mechanical

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.040 
is an ID by Bram Cohen it's a mechanical
puzzle<00:00:23.640> maybe<00:00:23.850> it's<00:00:24.060> a<00:00:24.119> twisty<00:00:24.510> puzzle<00:00:24.869> and

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
puzzle maybe it's a twisty puzzle and

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.400 
puzzle maybe it's a twisty puzzle and
you<00:00:25.859> see<00:00:26.070> all<00:00:26.400> the<00:00:26.699> spheres<00:00:27.359> they<00:00:27.930> have<00:00:28.140> teeth

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
you see all the spheres they have teeth

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.859 
you see all the spheres they have teeth
like<00:00:28.650> years<00:00:29.130> and<00:00:29.429> they<00:00:29.939> all<00:00:30.090> interact<00:00:30.689> like

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
like years and they all interact like

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.350 
like years and they all interact like
each<00:00:31.050> other<00:00:31.289> so<00:00:31.800> you<00:00:31.830> see<00:00:32.399> all<00:00:32.640> the<00:00:32.759> gears<00:00:33.000> they

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
each other so you see all the gears they

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.569 
each other so you see all the gears they
move<00:00:33.570> in<00:00:33.719> parallel<00:00:34.130> also<00:00:35.130> we<00:00:35.430> have<00:00:35.550> a

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
move in parallel also we have a

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.170 
move in parallel also we have a
mechanism<00:00:36.090> so<00:00:36.809> either<00:00:37.590> this<00:00:38.399> part<00:00:38.700> swivels

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
mechanism so either this part swivels

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.910 
mechanism so either this part swivels
open<00:00:40.250> or<00:00:41.250> that<00:00:41.520> part<00:00:41.790> swivels<00:00:42.360> open<00:00:42.750> so<00:00:43.680> this

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
open or that part swivels open so this

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.040 
open or that part swivels open so this
is<00:00:44.070> where<00:00:44.309> it<00:00:44.430> becomes<00:00:44.579> a<00:00:44.910> puzzle<00:00:45.270> because<00:00:45.899> if

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
is where it becomes a puzzle because if

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.680 
is where it becomes a puzzle because if
all<00:00:46.230> the<00:00:46.289> spheres<00:00:46.860> turn<00:00:47.430> in<00:00:47.579> parallel<00:00:48.030> then

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
all the spheres turn in parallel then

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.860 
all the spheres turn in parallel then
they<00:00:49.050> always<00:00:49.289> stay<00:00:49.860> aligned<00:00:50.219> and<00:00:50.520> read<00:00:51.449> parts

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
they always stay aligned and read parts

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.459 
they always stay aligned and read parts
are<00:00:52.110> always<00:00:52.500> together<00:00:53.329> but<00:00:54.329> once<00:00:54.600> you<00:00:55.050> swivel

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
are always together but once you swivel

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:00.189 
are always together but once you swivel
it<00:00:55.559> open<00:00:55.949> you<00:00:56.309> can<00:00:56.550> turn<00:00:57.360> to<00:00:58.320> steering<00:00:59.250> gears

00:01:00.189 --> 00:01:00.199 
it open you can turn to steering gears

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:03.319 
it open you can turn to steering gears
independently<00:01:01.199> and<00:01:01.440> then<00:01:02.160> once<00:01:02.760> you<00:01:02.940> put<00:01:03.149> them

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
independently and then once you put them

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.390 
independently and then once you put them
together<00:01:03.930> again<00:01:04.320> then<00:01:05.040> in<00:01:05.189> the<00:01:05.280> other

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
together again then in the other

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.730 
together again then in the other
direction<00:01:05.850> you<00:01:06.180> can<00:01:06.600> have<00:01:06.750> the<00:01:06.869> other<00:01:07.020> sphere

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
direction you can have the other sphere

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.370 
direction you can have the other sphere
gears<00:01:08.070> turn<00:01:08.729> independently<00:01:09.510> and<00:01:09.720> once<00:01:10.260> you

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
gears turn independently and once you

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.070 
gears turn independently and once you
have<00:01:10.530> scrambled<00:01:10.979> it<00:01:11.210> like<00:01:12.210> this<00:01:12.420> it's<00:01:12.780> very

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
have scrambled it like this it's very

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.130 
have scrambled it like this it's very
hard<00:01:13.530> to<00:01:13.650> solve<00:01:14.150> well<00:01:15.150> here's<00:01:15.509> the<00:01:15.689> problem

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
hard to solve well here's the problem

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.370 
hard to solve well here's the problem
about<00:01:16.710> this<00:01:16.950> puzzle<00:01:17.189> the<00:01:18.030> mechanism<00:01:18.600> is<00:01:18.840> not

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
about this puzzle the mechanism is not

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.090 
about this puzzle the mechanism is not
perfect<00:01:20.070> I<00:01:20.369> can<00:01:21.000> cheat<00:01:21.390> as<00:01:22.200> you<00:01:22.350> can<00:01:22.500> see<00:01:22.710> I<00:01:22.740> can

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
perfect I can cheat as you can see I can

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.690 
perfect I can cheat as you can see I can
open<00:01:23.460> it<00:01:23.580> like<00:01:24.240> this<00:01:24.299> and<00:01:24.750> the<00:01:25.710> gears<00:01:26.100> the

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
open it like this and the gears the

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.539 
open it like this and the gears the
spheres<00:01:27.060> they<00:01:27.270> turn<00:01:27.659> independently<00:01:28.549> another

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
spheres they turn independently another

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:33.530 
spheres they turn independently another
problem<00:01:30.150> that<00:01:30.180> is<00:01:30.390> the<00:01:31.350> puzzle<00:01:31.740> has<00:01:31.920> is<00:01:32.540> when

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
problem that is the puzzle has is when

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.240 
problem that is the puzzle has is when
you<00:01:33.659> want<00:01:33.840> to<00:01:33.960> put<00:01:34.170> them<00:01:34.320> back<00:01:34.619> together<00:01:35.009> again

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
you want to put them back together again

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.640 
you want to put them back together again
they<00:01:36.090> have<00:01:36.210> the<00:01:36.360> problem<00:01:36.780> that<00:01:36.990> you<00:01:37.409> first

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
they have the problem that you first

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:41.149 
they have the problem that you first
have<00:01:37.829> to<00:01:38.100> seek<00:01:38.400> where<00:01:39.090> every<00:01:39.750> pin<00:01:39.960> fits<00:01:40.350> so

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
have to seek where every pin fits so

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:44.420 
have to seek where every pin fits so
it's<00:01:41.820> very<00:01:42.030> hard<00:01:42.390> even<00:01:42.780> if<00:01:43.619> the<00:01:43.860> mechanism

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
it's very hard even if the mechanism

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.830 
it's very hard even if the mechanism
would<00:01:44.549> work<00:01:44.820> to<00:01:45.630> put<00:01:45.810> it<00:01:45.840> together<00:01:46.850> so<00:01:47.850> even

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
would work to put it together so even

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.249 
would work to put it together so even
though<00:01:48.990> it's<00:01:49.350> a<00:01:49.680> prototype<00:01:50.720> it's<00:01:51.720> the

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
though it's a prototype it's the

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:55.249 
though it's a prototype it's the
prototype<00:01:52.619> is<00:01:53.040> not<00:01:53.070> really<00:01:53.579> successful<00:01:54.259> so

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
prototype is not really successful so

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:59.240 
prototype is not really successful so
here's<00:01:55.530> my<00:01:55.710> question<00:01:56.000> to<00:01:57.000> you<00:01:57.860> this<00:01:58.860> is<00:01:59.040> not<00:01:59.219> a

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
here's my question to you this is not a

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.310 
here's my question to you this is not a
perfect<00:01:59.549> prototype<00:01:59.880> it's<00:02:00.509> definitely<00:02:01.110> a

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
perfect prototype it's definitely a

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.709 
perfect prototype it's definitely a
first<00:02:01.619> thing<00:02:01.890> should<00:02:02.670> I<00:02:02.850> present<00:02:03.270> it<00:02:03.420> to<00:02:03.570> you

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
first thing should I present it to you

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:07.700 
first thing should I present it to you
like<00:02:04.469> this<00:02:04.740> or<00:02:05.159> should<00:02:05.460> I<00:02:05.640> wait<00:02:05.909> until

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
like this or should I wait until

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.919 
like this or should I wait until
the<00:02:07.830> puzzle<00:02:08.729> has<00:02:08.940> reached<00:02:09.240> a<00:02:09.539> more<00:02:09.750> mature

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
the puzzle has reached a more mature

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:13.040 
the puzzle has reached a more mature
state<00:02:10.440> and<00:02:11.250> more<00:02:11.760> perfection<00:02:12.120> what<00:02:12.810> do<00:02:12.930> you

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
state and more perfection what do you

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:17.090 
state and more perfection what do you
think<00:02:13.490> thank<00:02:14.490> you<00:02:14.580> for<00:02:14.760> watching
