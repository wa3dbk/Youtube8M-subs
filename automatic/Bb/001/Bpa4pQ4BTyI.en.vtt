00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
think you can think of it as the fuel to

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:55.490 
think you can think of it as the fuel to
think<00:01:52.880> the<00:01:53.880> next<00:01:53.909> Center<00:01:54.390> down<00:01:54.570> is<00:01:54.750> the<00:01:54.899> Osmo

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
think the next Center down is the Osmo

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.289 
think the next Center down is the Osmo
Center<00:01:55.859> the<00:01:56.130> arch<00:01:56.310> the<00:01:56.520> center<00:01:56.820> is<00:01:56.969> how<00:01:57.240> you

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
Center the arch the center is how you

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.630 
Center the arch the center is how you

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
think it's how you conceptualize it's

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.840 
think it's how you conceptualize it's
the<00:02:00.030> way<00:02:00.179> you<00:02:00.240> think<00:02:00.979> the<00:02:01.979> next<00:02:02.490> Center<00:02:02.700> down

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
the way you think the next Center down

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.209 
the way you think the next Center down
is<00:02:03.119> the<00:02:03.299> throat<00:02:03.689> and<00:02:04.109> the<00:02:04.679> throat<00:02:04.920> is<00:02:05.039> about

is the throat and the throat is about

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:07.910 
is the throat and the throat is about
communication<00:02:05.869> expression<00:02:06.869> and<00:02:07.109> in<00:02:07.590> a<00:02:07.679> sense

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
communication expression and in a sense

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.260 
communication expression and in a sense
manifestation<00:02:08.910> and<00:02:09.450> we'll<00:02:09.720> look<00:02:09.899> at

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:10.270 
manifestation and we'll look at

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:11.820 
manifestation and we'll look at
that<00:02:10.420> a<00:02:10.450> little<00:02:10.690> deeper<00:02:11.020> in<00:02:11.140> the<00:02:11.320> in<00:02:11.620> the

that a little deeper in the in the

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:14.670 
that a little deeper in the in the
individual<00:02:12.310> sections<00:02:12.930> then<00:02:13.930> we<00:02:14.050> get<00:02:14.170> to<00:02:14.320> the<00:02:14.440> G

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:14.680 
individual sections then we get to the G

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:16.410 
individual sections then we get to the G
Center<00:02:15.010> this<00:02:15.190> is<00:02:15.250> the<00:02:15.430> expression<00:02:15.940> of<00:02:16.180> love

eagle or the will and that's really

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:33.570 
eagle or the will and that's really
about<00:02:31.690> being<00:02:31.900> able<00:02:32.080> to<00:02:32.320> make<00:02:32.500> promises<00:02:32.770> or<00:02:33.340> if

bear - we're gonna take a look at that

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:07.650 
bear - we're gonna take a look at that
then<00:03:06.070> we<00:03:06.160> get<00:03:06.280> to<00:03:06.400> the<00:03:06.490> sacral<00:03:06.910> Center<00:03:07.300> it's

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:07.660 
then we get to the sacral Center it's

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:09.890 
then we get to the sacral Center it's
either<00:03:07.840> defined<00:03:08.320> or<00:03:08.590> undefined<00:03:08.920> this<00:03:09.340> is

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:14.020 
fertility and energy for life we have

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:17.160 
fertility and energy for life we have
the<00:03:14.610> splenic<00:03:15.610> Senate<00:03:16.120> which<00:03:16.390> is<00:03:16.420> intuition

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:17.170 
the splenic Senate which is intuition

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:21.510 
the splenic Senate which is intuition
and<00:03:17.680> the<00:03:18.400> sense<00:03:18.640> of<00:03:18.730> well-being<00:03:18.940> and<00:03:20.220> then<00:03:21.220> we

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:21.520 
and the sense of well-being and then we

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:23.640 
and the sense of well-being and then we
have<00:03:21.730> the<00:03:22.030> root<00:03:22.360> Center<00:03:22.780> which<00:03:23.050> again<00:03:23.410> is<00:03:23.620> a

pressure center of fuel like a Kundalini
energy<00:03:25.870> it's<00:03:26.590> the<00:03:26.800> fuel<00:03:27.160> to<00:03:27.490> get<00:03:27.610> something

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:28.030 
energy it's the fuel to get something

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:30.390 
energy it's the fuel to get something
done<00:03:28.209> but<00:03:29.020> again<00:03:29.290> I'm<00:03:29.440> gonna<00:03:29.590> stress<00:03:29.860> guys<00:03:30.130> if

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:37.830 
centers that's gonna help you you know
you<00:03:36.130> need<00:03:36.400> to<00:03:36.459> really<00:03:36.760> focus<00:03:37.240> on<00:03:37.570> the<00:03:37.660> aura

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:37.840 
you need to really focus on the aura

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:40.470 
you need to really focus on the aura
here<00:03:38.140> because<00:03:38.440> that's<00:03:38.590> where<00:03:39.270> this<00:03:40.270> whole

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:40.480 
here because that's where this whole

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:43.020 
here because that's where this whole
experiment<00:03:40.930> begins<00:03:41.500> in<00:03:41.890> the<00:03:42.250> centers<00:03:42.700> are

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:43.030 
experiment begins in the centers are

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:45.180 
experiment begins in the centers are
just<00:03:43.209> a<00:03:43.300> way<00:03:43.480> to<00:03:43.540> kind<00:03:43.990> of<00:03:44.050> make<00:03:44.740> the<00:03:44.890> movie<00:03:45.160> a

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:45.190 
just a way to kind of make the movie a

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:46.620 
just a way to kind of make the movie a
little<00:03:45.430> bit<00:03:45.550> more<00:03:45.700> interesting<00:03:46.270> you<00:03:46.480> can

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:46.630 
little bit more interesting you can

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:48.840 
little bit more interesting you can
watch<00:03:46.900> how<00:03:47.380> it<00:03:47.709> works<00:03:47.890> you<00:03:48.430> know<00:03:48.550> you<00:03:48.610> can

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:48.850 
watch how it works you know you can

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:50.760 
watch how it works you know you can
watch<00:03:49.000> like<00:03:49.720> for<00:03:49.900> instance<00:03:50.200> I<00:03:50.290> have<00:03:50.410> a<00:03:50.440> defined

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:50.770 
watch like for instance I have a defined

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:52.740 
watch like for instance I have a defined
mind<00:03:51.160> and<00:03:51.430> Aashna<00:03:51.670> periods<00:03:52.270> it's<00:03:52.480> something

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:52.750 
mind and Aashna periods it's something

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:54.240 
mind and Aashna periods it's something
I'm<00:03:52.870> putting<00:03:53.230> out<00:03:53.350> into<00:03:53.590> the<00:03:53.740> world<00:03:53.860> I'm<00:03:54.040> doing

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:54.250 
I'm putting out into the world I'm doing

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:56.580 
I'm putting out into the world I'm doing
it<00:03:54.370> right<00:03:54.459> now<00:03:54.640> I'm<00:03:55.300> inspiring<00:03:55.780> you<00:03:56.140> to<00:03:56.170> learn

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:56.590 
it right now I'm inspiring you to learn

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:58.710 
it right now I'm inspiring you to learn
a<00:03:56.650> little<00:03:56.980> bit<00:03:57.070> more<00:03:57.280> about<00:03:57.430> human<00:03:57.730> design<00:03:58.000> but

00:03:58.710 --> 00:03:58.720 
a little bit more about human design but

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:00.090 
a little bit more about human design but
I'm<00:03:58.810> not<00:03:58.930> trying<00:03:59.200> to<00:03:59.230> make<00:03:59.350> any<00:03:59.560> decisions

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:00.100 
I'm not trying to make any decisions

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:02.000 
I'm not trying to make any decisions
from<00:04:00.370> there<00:04:00.640> if<00:04:01.030> you<00:04:01.180> understand<00:04:01.600> what<00:04:01.690> I<00:04:01.720> mean

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:02.010 
from there if you understand what I mean

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:04.350 
from there if you understand what I mean
but<00:04:03.010> if<00:04:03.100> I'm<00:04:03.220> around<00:04:03.430> somebody<00:04:03.790> that's<00:04:03.970> got<00:04:04.270> to

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:04.360 
but if I'm around somebody that's got to

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:06.510 
but if I'm around somebody that's got to
open<00:04:04.450> head<00:04:04.720> centers<00:04:05.110> and<00:04:05.770> I'm<00:04:05.920> thinking<00:04:06.340> about

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:06.520 
open head centers and I'm thinking about

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:08.130 
open head centers and I'm thinking about
something<00:04:06.760> all<00:04:07.300> of<00:04:07.450> a<00:04:07.510> sudden<00:04:07.780> it<00:04:07.840> comes<00:04:07.989> out

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:08.140 
something all of a sudden it comes out

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:10.350 
something all of a sudden it comes out
of<00:04:08.230> their<00:04:08.350> mouth<00:04:08.560> I<00:04:08.980> mean<00:04:09.459> it's<00:04:09.730> a<00:04:09.790> funny<00:04:10.090> thing

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:10.360 
of their mouth I mean it's a funny thing

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:12.120 
of their mouth I mean it's a funny thing
when<00:04:10.420> you<00:04:10.720> can<00:04:10.870> really<00:04:11.140> watch<00:04:11.320> this<00:04:11.739> and<00:04:11.980> see

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:12.130 
when you can really watch this and see

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:14.520 
when you can really watch this and see
how<00:04:12.280> it<00:04:12.400> all<00:04:12.489> works<00:04:12.820> but<00:04:13.600> again<00:04:13.930> I<00:04:14.170> don't<00:04:14.380> make

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:14.530 
how it all works but again I don't make

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:15.510 
how it all works but again I don't make
any<00:04:14.680> decisions<00:04:14.830> out<00:04:15.310> of

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:15.520 
any decisions out of

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:17.729 
any decisions out of
this<00:04:15.730> is<00:04:15.880> just<00:04:16.060> you<00:04:16.510> know<00:04:16.540> adds<00:04:16.900> to<00:04:17.260> the<00:04:17.350> movie

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:17.739 
this is just you know adds to the movie

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:19.440 
this is just you know adds to the movie
in<00:04:17.860> a<00:04:17.920> sense<00:04:18.160> it's<00:04:18.400> one<00:04:18.730> more<00:04:18.880> thing<00:04:18.940> to<00:04:19.239> watch

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:19.450 
in a sense it's one more thing to watch

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:22.050 
in a sense it's one more thing to watch
and<00:04:20.050> that's<00:04:20.709> the<00:04:21.070> whole<00:04:21.220> deal<00:04:21.430> here<00:04:21.489> in<00:04:21.820> human

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:22.060 
and that's the whole deal here in human

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:23.610 
and that's the whole deal here in human
design<00:04:22.300> its<00:04:22.510> it's<00:04:22.720> about<00:04:22.930> building<00:04:23.350> the

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:23.620 
design its it's about building the

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:25.350 
design its it's about building the
watcher<00:04:24.190> consciousness<00:04:24.790> the<00:04:24.970> one<00:04:25.120> that<00:04:25.270> can

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:25.360 
watcher consciousness the one that can

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:27.900 
watcher consciousness the one that can
watch<00:04:25.600> all<00:04:25.870> this<00:04:26.020> you<00:04:26.650> know<00:04:26.770> you<00:04:26.830> become<00:04:27.460> not

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:27.910 
watch all this you know you become not

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:30.120 
watch all this you know you become not
your<00:04:28.180> mind<00:04:28.480> and<00:04:28.960> you<00:04:29.350> become<00:04:29.650> the<00:04:29.680> one<00:04:29.890> that

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:30.130 
your mind and you become the one that

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:32.040 
your mind and you become the one that
even<00:04:30.340> watches<00:04:30.820> the<00:04:31.000> mind<00:04:31.240> you<00:04:31.750> know<00:04:31.780> how<00:04:31.990> the

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:32.050 
even watches the mind you know how the

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:33.930 
even watches the mind you know how the
mind<00:04:32.380> works<00:04:32.500> and<00:04:32.920> it's<00:04:33.100> tricks<00:04:33.520> how<00:04:33.880> the

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:33.940 
mind works and it's tricks how the

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:35.700 
mind works and it's tricks how the
emotions<00:04:34.420> works<00:04:34.630> and<00:04:34.900> it's<00:04:35.020> tricks<00:04:35.470> on<00:04:35.620> the

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:35.710 
emotions works and it's tricks on the

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:37.800 
emotions works and it's tricks on the
pressure<00:04:35.950> to<00:04:36.190> work<00:04:36.370> all<00:04:36.910> these<00:04:37.060> different

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:37.810 
pressure to work all these different

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:39.030 
pressure to work all these different
things<00:04:37.840> and<00:04:38.200> so<00:04:38.320> these<00:04:38.470> can<00:04:38.650> be<00:04:38.710> little

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:39.040 
things and so these can be little

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:41.790 
things and so these can be little
windows<00:04:39.370> and<00:04:39.610> movies<00:04:40.050> also<00:04:41.050> if<00:04:41.140> it's<00:04:41.320> open<00:04:41.620> not

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:41.800 
windows and movies also if it's open not

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:43.230 
windows and movies also if it's open not
only<00:04:41.830> is<00:04:42.070> it<00:04:42.190> twice<00:04:42.430> as<00:04:42.610> loud<00:04:42.820> in<00:04:43.180> the

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:43.240 
only is it twice as loud in the

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:45.330 
only is it twice as loud in the
beginning<00:04:43.660> and<00:04:43.810> has<00:04:43.930> it<00:04:44.140> probably<00:04:44.740> been<00:04:45.070> you

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:45.340 
beginning and has it probably been you

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:47.130 
beginning and has it probably been you
know<00:04:45.460> your<00:04:45.790> biggest<00:04:46.030> demons<00:04:46.570> in<00:04:46.720> this<00:04:46.900> life

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:47.140 
know your biggest demons in this life

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:48.600 
know your biggest demons in this life
well<00:04:47.380> it's<00:04:47.470> been<00:04:47.620> pulling<00:04:47.950> you<00:04:48.070> around<00:04:48.340> and

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:48.610 
well it's been pulling you around and

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:50.850 
well it's been pulling you around and
controlling<00:04:49.420> you<00:04:49.570> but<00:04:50.320> it's<00:04:50.650> also

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:50.860 
controlling you but it's also

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:53.310 
controlling you but it's also
potentially<00:04:51.160> if<00:04:52.090> you're<00:04:52.450> really<00:04:52.780> living<00:04:52.990> from

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:53.320 
potentially if you're really living from

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:54.930 
potentially if you're really living from
yourself<00:04:53.770> and<00:04:54.040> you're<00:04:54.160> correct<00:04:54.640> or<00:04:54.820> a

00:04:59.340 --> 00:04:59.350 
authority it can also be a place of deep

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:02.310 
authority it can also be a place of deep
deep<00:04:59.590> wisdom<00:05:00.120> once<00:05:01.120> you're<00:05:01.270> really<00:05:01.660> clean<00:05:01.960> and

deep wisdom once you're really clean and

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:04.230 
deep wisdom once you're really clean and
you<00:05:02.770> make<00:05:02.950> it<00:05:03.100> through<00:05:03.280> the<00:05:03.580> whole<00:05:03.700> seven<00:05:04.090> year

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:04.240 
you make it through the whole seven year

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:06.360 
you make it through the whole seven year
deal<00:05:04.510> and<00:05:04.840> you<00:05:05.230> reconstruct<00:05:05.740> your<00:05:06.010> entire
