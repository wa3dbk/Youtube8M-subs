is centered over a good chunk of wood
and<00:01:30.689> it's<00:01:30.840> not<00:01:31.020> just<00:01:31.820> well<00:01:32.820> you<00:01:32.939> wouldn't<00:01:33.180> want

and it's not just well you wouldn't want
to<00:01:33.360> break<00:01:33.570> anything<00:01:33.900> off<00:01:34.259> right<00:01:34.530> there<00:01:34.770> at

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
to break anything off right there at

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.080 
to break anything off right there at
that<00:01:35.040> pickup<00:01:35.659> right<00:01:36.659> up<00:01:36.810> in<00:01:36.960> there<00:01:37.170> anyway<00:01:38.090> so

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
that pickup right up in there anyway so

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:45.499 
that pickup right up in there anyway so
I<00:01:39.509> had<00:01:39.990> about<00:01:41.060> point<00:01:42.079> two<00:01:44.329> millimeters<00:01:45.329> I

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
I had about point two millimeters I

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:50.450 
I had about point two millimeters I
think<00:01:45.780> of<00:01:47.689> bow<00:01:48.689> in<00:01:48.960> this<00:01:49.140> the<00:01:49.950> wrong<00:01:50.189> direction

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
think of bow in this the wrong direction

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:57.380 
think of bow in this the wrong direction
and<00:01:51.439> the<00:01:52.439> more<00:01:52.649> you<00:01:52.799> tighten<00:01:53.040> I<00:01:54.079> the<00:01:56.180> the<00:01:57.180> nut

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
and the more you tighten I the the nut

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.840 
and the more you tighten I the the nut
on<00:01:57.600> this<00:01:57.780> thing<00:01:58.110> the<00:01:58.500> more<00:01:58.890> bow<00:01:59.130> it<00:01:59.340> put<00:01:59.549> in<00:01:59.700> it

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
on this thing the more bow it put in it

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.639 
on this thing the more bow it put in it
oh<00:01:59.969> it<00:02:00.210> wouldn't<00:02:00.600> fix<00:02:00.810> anything<00:02:01.140> and<00:02:01.320> then<00:02:01.619> I

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
oh it wouldn't fix anything and then I

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:04.670 
oh it wouldn't fix anything and then I
noticed<00:02:02.119> from<00:02:03.119> the<00:02:03.240> factory<00:02:03.840> or<00:02:04.110> whoever<00:02:04.409> had

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680

with<00:02:24.300> no<00:02:24.510> fret<00:02:24.840> bus<00:02:25.080> you<00:02:25.380> know<00:02:25.410> maybe<00:02:25.740> a<00:02:26.130> tad

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
with no fret bus you know maybe a tad

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.660 
with no fret bus you know maybe a tad
bit<00:02:27.150> but<00:02:27.540> this<00:02:28.350> thing<00:02:28.650> sounded<00:02:29.310> like<00:02:29.400> one<00:02:29.610> of

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
bit but this thing sounded like one of

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:34.310 
bit but this thing sounded like one of
those<00:02:29.750> sitars<00:02:30.750> or<00:02:31.020> whatever<00:02:31.350> but<00:02:32.100> anyway<00:02:33.320> so

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:34.320 
those sitars or whatever but anyway so

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:38.660 
those sitars or whatever but anyway so
my<00:02:34.440> method<00:02:34.830> is<00:02:36.230> you<00:02:37.230> put<00:02:37.440> the<00:02:37.560> dowel<00:02:37.740> rod<00:02:38.070> on

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
my method is you put the dowel rod on

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:40.700 
my method is you put the dowel rod on
there<00:02:39.000> and<00:02:39.210> you<00:02:39.390> can<00:02:39.510> actually<00:02:39.720> you<00:02:40.680> can

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:40.710 
there and you can actually you can

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:42.890 
there and you can actually you can
actually<00:02:41.190> tune<00:02:41.430> all<00:02:41.730> these<00:02:42.000> strings<00:02:42.390> believe

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
actually tune all these strings believe

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.020 
actually tune all these strings believe
it<00:02:43.020> or<00:02:43.110> not<00:02:43.230> square<00:02:44.040> off<00:02:44.190> of<00:02:44.370> this<00:02:44.520> piece<00:02:44.820> right

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
it or not square off of this piece right

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:49.250 
it or not square off of this piece right
here<00:02:45.560> anyway<00:02:46.560> so<00:02:46.620> I<00:02:46.800> tuned<00:02:47.100> everything<00:02:47.730> up<00:02:48.260> to

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
here anyway so I tuned everything up to

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:53.270 
here anyway so I tuned everything up to
F<00:02:49.620> sharp<00:02:50.209> it's<00:02:51.209> set<00:02:51.540> for<00:02:51.870> the<00:02:51.959> last<00:02:52.230> couple<00:02:53.070> of

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
F sharp it's set for the last couple of

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:56.390 
F sharp it's set for the last couple of
strings<00:02:53.670> or<00:02:54.330> so<00:02:54.570> they're<00:02:55.260> close<00:02:55.680> not<00:02:56.040> all<00:02:56.250> the

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
strings or so they're close not all the

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:59.030 
strings or so they're close not all the
way<00:02:56.520> I<00:02:56.550> didn't<00:02:56.880> want<00:02:57.000> to<00:02:57.090> break<00:02:57.270> anything<00:02:58.040> as

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
way I didn't want to break anything as

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:02.210 
way I didn't want to break anything as
far<00:02:59.310> as<00:02:59.459> my<00:02:59.850> strings<00:03:00.240> that's<00:03:00.510> 10<00:03:00.780> gauge<00:03:01.220> Ernie

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
far as my strings that's 10 gauge Ernie

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:06.199 
far as my strings that's 10 gauge Ernie
balls<00:03:02.550> on<00:03:03.480> there<00:03:04.100> anyway<00:03:05.100> so<00:03:05.760> you<00:03:05.850> take<00:03:06.060> the

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:06.209 
balls on there anyway so you take the

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:09.080 
balls on there anyway so you take the
heating<00:03:06.540> pad<00:03:06.750> and<00:03:07.020> you<00:03:07.380> just<00:03:07.560> basically<00:03:08.090> take

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
heating pad and you just basically take

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:11.990 
heating pad and you just basically take
it<00:03:09.330> and<00:03:09.660> you<00:03:10.080> loop<00:03:10.320> it<00:03:10.470> underneath<00:03:10.770> all<00:03:11.700> these

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 
it and you loop it underneath all these

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.580 
it and you loop it underneath all these
strings<00:03:12.390> like<00:03:12.690> that<00:03:12.900> and<00:03:13.050> just<00:03:13.200> wrap<00:03:13.410> it

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 
strings like that and just wrap it

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:16.130 
strings like that and just wrap it
around<00:03:13.680> the<00:03:14.010> whole<00:03:14.270> the<00:03:15.270> whole<00:03:15.300> thing<00:03:15.780> and

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:16.140 
around the whole the whole thing and

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:17.870 
around the whole the whole thing and
then<00:03:16.260> turn<00:03:16.500> it<00:03:16.530> on<00:03:16.800> high<00:03:17.040> and<00:03:17.310> this<00:03:17.580> heating

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:17.880 
then turn it on high and this heating

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:19.970 
then turn it on high and this heating
pad<00:03:18.090> only<00:03:18.390> runs<00:03:18.630> for<00:03:18.810> two<00:03:19.110> hours<00:03:19.470> at<00:03:19.620> a<00:03:19.650> time

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:19.980 
pad only runs for two hours at a time

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:24.470 
pad only runs for two hours at a time
so<00:03:20.940> you<00:03:21.900> know<00:03:22.550> the<00:03:23.550> way<00:03:23.700> I've<00:03:23.850> been<00:03:23.880> doing<00:03:24.360> it

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 
so you know the way I've been doing it

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.780 
so you know the way I've been doing it
was<00:03:24.750> I<00:03:25.050> ran<00:03:25.470> it<00:03:25.709> for<00:03:25.920> two<00:03:26.040> hours<00:03:26.070> last<00:03:26.580> night

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790 
was I ran it for two hours last night

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:29.210 
was I ran it for two hours last night
and<00:03:27.090> it<00:03:27.180> cut<00:03:27.390> off<00:03:27.540> automatically<00:03:28.170> I<00:03:28.470> let<00:03:29.100> it

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220 
and it cut off automatically I let it

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:31.699 
and it cut off automatically I let it
cool<00:03:29.400> down<00:03:29.670> to<00:03:30.630> room<00:03:30.660> temperature<00:03:30.840> and<00:03:31.350> sit

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:31.709 
cool down to room temperature and sit

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:37.160 
cool down to room temperature and sit
overnight<00:03:32.070> and<00:03:33.620> it<00:03:34.620> took<00:03:34.910> almost<00:03:35.910> that<00:03:36.420> I<00:03:36.690> mean

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:37.170 
overnight and it took almost that I mean

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:38.810 
overnight and it took almost that I mean
that<00:03:37.410> when<00:03:37.709> I<00:03:37.739> woke<00:03:38.010> up<00:03:38.160> this<00:03:38.340> morning<00:03:38.700> and

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:38.820 
that when I woke up this morning and

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:42.199 
that when I woke up this morning and
remeasured<00:03:39.420> the<00:03:39.540> neck<00:03:40.700> it<00:03:41.700> was<00:03:41.910> almost

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:42.209 
remeasured the neck it was almost

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:45.410 
remeasured the neck it was almost
completely<00:03:43.220> level<00:03:44.220> with<00:03:44.850> all<00:03:45.030> that<00:03:45.209> with

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:45.420 
completely level with all that with

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:47.240 
completely level with all that with
these<00:03:45.690> strings<00:03:46.019> on<00:03:46.260> here<00:03:46.500> tight<00:03:46.860> you<00:03:47.130> know

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.250 
these strings on here tight you know

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:50.570 
these strings on here tight you know
just<00:03:47.489> like<00:03:47.610> it<00:03:47.760> sits<00:03:48.030> right<00:03:48.209> now<00:03:48.269> and<00:03:48.920> I<00:03:49.920> put<00:03:50.489> it

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:50.580 
just like it sits right now and I put it

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:52.580 
just like it sits right now and I put it
on<00:03:50.640> there<00:03:50.880> again<00:03:50.970> this<00:03:51.360> afternoon<00:03:51.600> let<00:03:52.350> sit

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:52.590 
on there again this afternoon let sit

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:55.580 
on there again this afternoon let sit
for<00:03:52.620> two<00:03:52.920> hours<00:03:53.690> with<00:03:54.690> heat<00:03:54.900> on<00:03:55.080> it<00:03:55.200> on<00:03:55.350> high

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:55.590 
for two hours with heat on it on high

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:58.009 
for two hours with heat on it on high
and<00:03:55.920> then<00:03:56.010> I<00:03:56.760> let<00:03:56.970> it<00:03:57.090> cool<00:03:57.269> back<00:03:57.510> down<00:03:57.540> with

00:03:58.009 --> 00:03:58.019 
and then I let it cool back down with

00:03:58.019 --> 00:03:59.360 
and then I let it cool back down with
the<00:03:58.140> heating<00:03:58.380> pad<00:03:58.530> still<00:03:58.860> on<00:03:58.980> it<00:03:59.100> I<00:03:59.160> didn't

00:03:59.360 --> 00:03:59.370 
the heating pad still on it I didn't

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:00.199 
the heating pad still on it I didn't
touch<00:03:59.519> anything

00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:00.209 
touch anything

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:03.140 
touch anything
it<00:04:00.510> just<00:04:00.780> shut<00:04:00.900> itself<00:04:01.260> off<00:04:01.500> and<00:04:01.890> then<00:04:02.790> I

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:03.150 
it just shut itself off and then I

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:07.520 
it just shut itself off and then I
measured<00:04:03.840> it<00:04:03.959> again<00:04:04.320> and<00:04:04.680> it<00:04:05.010> had<00:04:06.290> the<00:04:07.290> right

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:07.530 
measured it again and it had the right

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:11.449 
measured it again and it had the right
it's<00:04:08.519> getting<00:04:08.790> there<00:04:09.120> it<00:04:09.420> had<00:04:09.600> about<00:04:10.459> the

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:11.459 
it's getting there it had about the

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:15.170 
it's getting there it had about the
right<00:04:11.760> amount<00:04:12.180> of<00:04:12.480> I<00:04:13.459> guess<00:04:14.459> you<00:04:14.610> call<00:04:14.850> it<00:04:14.880> up

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:15.180 
right amount of I guess you call it up

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:18.860 
right amount of I guess you call it up
bow<00:04:15.450> in<00:04:15.840> at<00:04:16.109> this<00:04:16.260> time<00:04:16.560> we're<00:04:17.419> at<00:04:18.419> the<00:04:18.630> fifth

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:18.870 
bow in at this time we're at the fifth

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:22.400 
bow in at this time we're at the fifth
fret<00:04:18.989> I<00:04:19.470> was<00:04:20.070> actually<00:04:20.310> starting<00:04:20.850> to<00:04:21.090> see<00:04:21.510> the

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:22.410 
fret I was actually starting to see the

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:24.550 
fret I was actually starting to see the
right<00:04:22.650> amount<00:04:22.950> of<00:04:23.010> bow<00:04:23.220> you<00:04:23.490> could<00:04:23.700> probably

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:24.560 
right amount of bow you could probably

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:27.320 
right amount of bow you could probably
fit<00:04:25.560> a<00:04:25.830> really<00:04:26.610> thin

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:27.330 
fit a really thin

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:29.570 
fit a really thin
nylon<00:04:28.050> pick<00:04:28.349> under<00:04:28.710> there<00:04:28.860> or<00:04:29.069> something<00:04:29.460> you

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:29.580 
nylon pick under there or something you

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:34.070 
nylon pick under there or something you
know<00:04:29.960> anyway<00:04:30.979> so<00:04:31.979> I'm<00:04:32.819> gonna<00:04:33.000> probably<00:04:33.240> have<00:04:34.050> a

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:34.080 
know anyway so I'm gonna probably have a

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:36.950 
know anyway so I'm gonna probably have a
go<00:04:34.319> at<00:04:34.560> it<00:04:34.710> one<00:04:35.220> or<00:04:35.370> two<00:04:35.520> more<00:04:35.759> times<00:04:36.060> because<00:04:36.750> I

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:36.960 
go at it one or two more times because I

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:40.550 
go at it one or two more times because I
have<00:04:37.229> the<00:04:37.530> truss<00:04:38.460> rod<00:04:38.580> not<00:04:39.289> completely<00:04:40.289> backed

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:40.560 
have the truss rod not completely backed

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:43.550 
have the truss rod not completely backed
off<00:04:40.800> of<00:04:41.129> it<00:04:41.250> there's<00:04:41.960> absolutely<00:04:42.960> no<00:04:43.229> pressure

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:43.560 
off of it there's absolutely no pressure

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:46.249 
off of it there's absolutely no pressure
on<00:04:43.800> that<00:04:43.949> net<00:04:44.190> whatsoever<00:04:44.879> as<00:04:45.720> far<00:04:46.020> as<00:04:46.139> the

00:04:46.249 --> 00:04:46.259 
on that net whatsoever as far as the

00:04:46.259 --> 00:04:47.890 
on that net whatsoever as far as the
truss<00:04:46.500> rod<00:04:46.590> has<00:04:46.949> anything<00:04:47.220> to<00:04:47.370> do<00:04:47.610> with<00:04:47.639> it

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:47.900 
truss rod has anything to do with it

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:52.490 
truss rod has anything to do with it
anyway<00:04:49.220> I'll<00:04:50.220> probably<00:04:50.960> make<00:04:51.960> another<00:04:52.139> video

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:52.500 
anyway I'll probably make another video

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:59.689 
anyway I'll probably make another video
when<00:04:53.129> I'm<00:04:53.250> done<00:04:53.490> of<00:04:56.629> the<00:04:57.629> end<00:04:57.870> project<00:04:58.699> anyway

00:04:59.689 --> 00:04:59.699 
when I'm done of the end project anyway

00:04:59.699 --> 00:05:02.690 
when I'm done of the end project anyway
things
