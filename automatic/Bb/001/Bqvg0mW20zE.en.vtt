00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:07.450
 do you have 

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:16.330
 hello very good to all and welcome to 

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:18.670
 a new video of c-12 as you know 

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:20.170
 those that you have seen the previous video 

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:22.960
 I've been out the weekend and 

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:24.850
 that I could not upload more videos than 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:27.279
 I would have liked it but yes it is 

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:30.880
 true that I have made several attacks with 

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:32.250
 several armies and well I have two for 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:34.150
 two repetitions to teach you that 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.860
 logically I would have liked to do in 

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:37.390
 direct but as it was not and I've 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:40.360
 done with the dock because they have not been able 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:42.850
 to be worth so first of all I want to 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:45.790
 tell you that I have several wars 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:47.500
 testing several non-diverse armies 

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:49.870
 guys about everything that convinced me the most 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:52.090
 He was a giant healer breaks walls and 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:54.070
 alcaraz and magicians from behind but it was not 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:56.590
 very effective then upload videos from 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:57.940
 mounts no lie I did not go up but serious as 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:59.680
 what happened is that they were a total disaster 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:01.930
 of riding pigs of dragons in order that 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:03.610
 tried everything and this weekend I finally 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:06.759
 tried one that I liked a lot 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:08.200
 I've made three stars in both attacks 

00:01:06.759 --> 00:01:10.030
 pity that none was the most 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:11.260
 heroic but I'm going to teach it because 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:12.850
 good 

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:15.160
 in passing document a little bit of the 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:17.590
 army that goes and what is the goal 

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:19.360
 what kind of attack and so on so to 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:21.760
 see if I can find the replays 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:23.090
 is worth one here is worth this is the 

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:26.179
 first 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:28.969
 As I was out in two years, 

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:30.259
 I did almost at the end already when all the 

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:32.359
 Practicing villages had been attacked 

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:34.460
 I think I already had a star 

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:37.179
 I'm sure but it 's a city hall 7 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:39.829
 it's a very easy city ​​hall 7 but 

00:01:37.179 --> 00:01:42.679
 city ​​hall 7 absolutely to the maximum 

00:01:39.829 --> 00:01:44.990
 that wall but I do not care because the 

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:49.189
 attack that I have done has been aerial and 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:51.319
 you open that troop I use the truth is that what 

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:54.270
 first yes or yes is that you have to take 

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:57.299
 castles and hero 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.979
 in the castle of mine I think I was wearing 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:00.929
 archers and wizards in both or that is what 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:02.070
 better especially if they are magicians because 

00:02:00.929 --> 00:02:04.890
 cool 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:07.170
 what you should look for in a village to the 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:09.750
 time to attack the air is to look 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:12.900
 in antiaircraft the situation the level 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:16.140
 and if it has crossbows also in the 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:18.209
 placement of the crossbows is good 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:20.129
 because I made this attack because it ends 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:22.260
 to upload the minions to 3 the week 

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:24.090
 last and I had finished the balloons at 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.590
 5 this week then as there was already 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:27.510
 made similar attacks previously 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:28.799
 but with lower level troops do not go 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:30.269
 it went very well that they already put the test 

00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:32.849
 now so you see I was loaded the 

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:35.519
 castle I charge the hero loose 

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:38.160
 very scattered minions to jump 

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:40.380
 the aerial mines are damaging in 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:41.849
 zone and when I see that nothing comes out 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:43.950
 nothing loose a strip of balloons for a 

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:45.720
 another village flank pulls on the other 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:47.069
 to knock down the antiaircraft here a 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:49.739
 especially anger at the largest group 

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:51.120
 to knock down the anti-aircraft this this me 

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:53.129
 it's costing more but as I carry two 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:54.930
 cures here that are going to join the 

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:56.370
 two groups of loose wolves both 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:57.780
 cures more than anything because they are already 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:00.209
 quite damaged because there are four 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:00.870
 defenses standing and while good what 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:03.180
 I said 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:04.890
 more of the dog balloon from behind for 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:06.569
 that is doing percentages by 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:07.830
 example look at this cannon you can not 

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:11.099
 turn on and here is the minion the ground 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:13.440
 loading it is worth the castle I do not know 

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:15.959
 where the not in this in this I think not 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:17.700
 I let that good and you see plenty 

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:19.019
 that is without problem can also lead 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:20.519
 in the castle more balloons or more 

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:22.379
 serve them and that according to each one 

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:25.470
 like I am a supporter because 

00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:27.750
 loose I do not know right here is worth and 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:30.000
 just this they know five balloons and they come out 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:33.150
 the air mines and since that is the five 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.700
 I win it then I prefer magicians and 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:37.590
 now for example if there was a defense 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:38.970
 no but I did not have minions left 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:40.829
 to go making percentages forms 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:42.299
 fast the magicians sweep the village in 

00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:44.670
 question of seconds 

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:47.640
 so you can see 24 level balloons 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:49.379
 5 32 of level 3 and a few boxes only 

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:50.879
 would pass the castle nothing else in this 

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:53.040
 case then weeks given the castle with 

00:03:50.879 --> 00:03:55.799
 minions like this 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:57.959
 the castle because being a dragon I say 

00:03:55.799 --> 00:04:00.329
 loose a few minions so distributed and 

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:02.880
 the dragon only worth a posy 

00:04:00.329 --> 00:04:05.010
 rabies two heals all at level 4 

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:06.150
 I was in that it is very easy wall on 7 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:08.670
 but just because you go up 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:10.350
 logically and then I was looking for one of 

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:12.000
 level 8 and as they were all attacking 

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:14.280
 I said good because we are going to put 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:18.290
 level 9 is worth having a crossbow 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:20.610
 if I'm not wrong on the ground 

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:22.350
 but its anti-aircraft apart that only 

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:24.450
 I had three of the four I had 

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:26.520
 level 2 and 3 then very easy is very 

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:29.100
 out to here you can see 1 level 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:30.510
 1 level 2 and another level 2 is worth then 

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:32.640
 here as it does not break walls pulled the 

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:35.220
 castle that magicians call 5 magicians of 

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:37.290
 level 5 which was not going to be a bit 

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:39.630
 complicated the crossbow here on earth 

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:42.420
 my air and on top less cool because 

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:44.400
 look if it breaks the wall I let go of here from 

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:47.010
 a lot of traps queen and king me the 

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:48.420
 I have a little corner here here if I do not 

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:51.840
 I'm wrong, yes, I loose the castle that 

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:54.120
 he had magicians of level 5 or 6 if not 

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:55.810
 I remember badly we will see it is worth a whole 

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:59.350
 corner 

00:04:55.810 --> 00:05:00.520
 who you were to distract the king with the 

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:02.740
 also rage with the various milestones for 

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:05.530
 distract and the castle because he was not wearing 

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:07.240
 25 who was just good that for 

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:09.040
 this side as regards a farm to its 

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:11.230
 heroes and the castle that does not cost me 

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:12.550
 nothing the same as before a few minions by 

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:14.680
 here here some heights in each corner 

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:16.630
 to go making percentages 

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:17.889
 minions above wanted to enter by 

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:20.020
 up and on the right because the 

00:05:17.889 --> 00:05:21.130
 old ones are up to the right and the 

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:23.200
 crossbow also up on the left 

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:25.090
 then a rage here to end with 

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:27.520
 the anti-arian and a half that just as well 

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:29.830
 I like the mines and with the crossbow and 

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:32.290
 straight minions behind cleaning 

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:35.680
 The whole area at least look for 50% 

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:37.570
 and to be able to be the city council 

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:39.220
 and the cures in the center because 

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:40.780
 because there is the crossbow because there 

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:42.400
 also four defenses and then since 

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:44.740
 there would be three of which one ring 

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:47.229
 could defend himself then this is where 

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:48.789
 I want to heal the whole set of 

00:05:47.229 --> 00:05:50.680
 balloons and then behind you serve them already 

00:05:48.789 --> 00:05:52.750
 you see what it takes to the city council in 

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:53.740
 end so much an attack as the other you can 

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:57.280
 watch 

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:59.229
 one let's say is the army is 

00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:01.599
 exactly the same 24 balloons you'll have 

00:05:59.229 --> 00:06:03.699
 alive is worth only one so I decided 

00:06:01.599 --> 00:06:06.240
 take out breaking walls for the castle and 

00:06:03.699 --> 00:06:08.710
 such but good that's silly 

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:11.500
 you can see in both that a lot villages 

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:12.910
 let's say more advanced than the other 

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:15.130
 better not in terms of defenses but in 

00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:17.500
 regarding buildings in terms of defenses 

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:19.210
 I mean level is worth but what is 

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:21.940
 what you can appreciate is that in both 

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:24.580
 There is a lot of army of wolves left over 

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:26.289
 five dogs to 3 even if he has that dog 

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:27.729
 two balloons four really that what 

00:06:26.289 --> 00:06:29.319
 better the new four you notice a lot 

00:06:27.729 --> 00:06:32.169
 but serving them is not so great either 

00:06:29.319 --> 00:06:34.240
 thing you can do an air attack and 

00:06:32.169 --> 00:06:35.919
 carlos a village far superior to the 

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:38.440
 yours without any difficulty because 

00:06:35.919 --> 00:06:39.880
 I repeat you spare me to me at least more 

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:41.590
 there is a lot of army left in the two attacks 

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:43.720
 so one could have sucked 

00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:44.949
 most advanced level 9 village even a 

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:47.080
 level 10 but it is true that 

00:06:44.949 --> 00:06:48.880
 they were all attacked then since 

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:51.699
 the three stars that came to us from 

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:53.289
 luxury because the war was quite 

00:06:51.699 --> 00:06:55.150
 equaled yes we really did more 

00:06:53.289 --> 00:06:58.120
 attacks let's make more stars 

00:06:55.150 --> 00:06:59.590
 and if I can in the next few days 

00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:01.720
 how can you not be an insurance that 

00:06:59.590 --> 00:07:04.240
 we can the question is that I can 

00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:06.760
 record it and repeat the attack and 

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:09.460
 we will look for a revenge or a goal 

00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:12.220
 very superior is worth a town hall 9 or 10 

00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:14.230
 advanced not in the English king and I like that 

00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:17.020
 already in normal attack 

00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:19.270
 I'll ask for a good castle and well we'll see 

00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:21.520
 how is a live attack worth so 

00:07:19.270 --> 00:07:23.670
 that nothing of always hope that you 

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:23.670
 I liked it 

00:07:33.430 --> 00:07:36.430
 A) Yes
