00:00:02.390 --> 00:00:05.390
 it's hard 

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:09.560
 friends of the detainees was one more capsule 

00:00:10.219 --> 00:00:12.589
 percent of the moral officer 

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:15.079
 it's thanks to this season 

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:18.460
 percent received many and many comments 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:21.460
 With respect to 

00:00:22.989 --> 00:00:25.329
 this bridge 

00:00:25.329 --> 00:00:27.089
 Well, now I help you 

00:00:27.089 --> 00:00:30.009
 having a better relationship with the horse 

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:33.009
 this second type is about 

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:36.300
 how we owe it to the horse 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.130
 but giving us this descent 

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:44.720
 very important that for this for this task we are aware of the 

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:47.960
 importance that the horse is always quiet 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:51.200
 if we get on a horse 

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:56.590
 and the horse is giving we will have one more task to worry about yes 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:59.560
 since we are involving speed 

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:03.120
 yes we try and for that speed we must have control 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:07.130
 let's proceed with the riding of the horse 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:10.190
 It's very important 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:11.770
 as I mentioned 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:12.970
 that the horse 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:15.940
 always be a relaxed and calm state 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:18.450
 if you on a restless horse 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.870
 yes where at all times they have not even touched the stirrup and the horse is 

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:24.250
 moving 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:25.830
 beforehand 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.270
 p when you place a foot 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:31.030
 to get on the horse will continue its movement 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:34.490
 then the important thing the first thing the basics is 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:37.490
 that you to walk a hundred his 

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:40.750
 by trimming his body 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:44.140
 backwards the horse may be 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:45.390
 quiet 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.300
 how would she be counting now 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:49.290
 a few steps later 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:53.410
 what I did to counteract that movement forward moving the 

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:54.450
 others 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.730
 we take the reins 

00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:00.040
 you can tell that the reins are so loose 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:02.460
 this means that if I get on 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.510
 and the horse does not walk 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:07.919
 it means that these festivals are with my rival presence 

00:02:07.919 --> 00:02:10.519
 if I'm always holding 

00:02:10.519 --> 00:02:12.899
 There will come a time when I let him go 

00:02:12.899 --> 00:02:14.529
 the horse advances 

00:02:14.529 --> 00:02:16.930
 because I'm preventing the movement in 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:19.219
 and I want is that the horse is always 

00:02:19.219 --> 00:02:22.219
 per cent available to what I want 

00:02:22.949 --> 00:02:25.229
 we take the reins 

00:02:25.229 --> 00:02:28.549
 you can tell that the reins are so loose 

00:02:28.549 --> 00:02:30.959
 this means that if I get on 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:33.039
 and the horse does not walk 

00:02:33.039 --> 00:02:36.419
 means that in these this sect is not my living presence of 

00:02:36.419 --> 00:02:39.049
 if I'm always holding 

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:41.399
 There will come a time when I let him go 

00:02:41.399 --> 00:02:43.019
 the horse advances 

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:45.419
 because I'm preventing the movement in 

00:02:45.419 --> 00:02:47.709
 and I want is that the horse is always 

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:50.960
 per 100 available to what they 

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:53.279
 we take the stirrup 

00:02:53.279 --> 00:02:55.479
 we put the left foot 

00:02:55.479 --> 00:02:58.479
 we can see the attitude of the horse if it is a relaxed attitude 

00:02:59.429 --> 00:03:01.029
 and subsequently 

00:03:01.029 --> 00:03:04.029
 It's not serious 

00:03:05.139 --> 00:03:07.139
 3 tips that can help us 

00:03:07.139 --> 00:03:11.619
 Another factor is that it can help us to determine if it was and is 

00:03:11.619 --> 00:03:14.719
 available when opting to fall to this one 

00:03:14.719 --> 00:03:16.549
 to this mountain 

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:18.879
 a calm and relaxed attitude 

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:21.619
 that at the moment that I took the reins 

00:03:21.619 --> 00:03:25.790
 he does not interpret this signal as a command signal neither forward nor 

00:03:25.789 --> 00:03:26.829
 backward 

00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:29.039
 and once I go up 

00:03:29.039 --> 00:03:32.309
 yes and I'm on top of him he continues with that relaxed attitude 

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:34.659
 later 

00:03:34.659 --> 00:03:37.369
 We walk 

00:03:37.369 --> 00:03:38.779
 We have achieved 

00:03:38.779 --> 00:03:40.209
 the power 

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:42.259
 percent 

00:03:42.259 --> 00:03:44.359
 establish this contact 

00:03:44.359 --> 00:03:45.309
 as 

00:03:45.309 --> 00:03:47.429
 this quiet the contact with the front
