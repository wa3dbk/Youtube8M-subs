this<00:02:55.660> car<00:02:55.989> is<00:02:56.230> the<00:02:56.290> boot<00:02:56.940> now<00:02:57.940> first<00:02:58.690> of<00:02:58.870> all

00:02:59.040 --> 00:02:59.050 
this car is the boot now first of all

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:01.800 
this car is the boot now first of all
it's<00:02:59.319> tiny<00:02:59.680> but<00:03:00.069> more<00:03:00.730> annoyingly<00:03:01.269> is<00:03:01.569> this

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:01.810 
it's tiny but more annoyingly is this

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:03.750 
it's tiny but more annoyingly is this
parcel<00:03:02.319> shelf<00:03:02.560> which<00:03:02.830> doesn't<00:03:03.280> lift<00:03:03.459> with<00:03:03.670> the

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:03.760 
parcel shelf which doesn't lift with the

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:06.120 
parcel shelf which doesn't lift with the
boot<00:03:03.940> lid<00:03:04.180> combined<00:03:05.080> with<00:03:05.260> the<00:03:05.349> high<00:03:05.530> load<00:03:05.830> lip

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:06.130 
boot lid combined with the high load lip

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:09.360 
boot lid combined with the high load lip
means<00:03:07.000> is<00:03:07.360> pretty<00:03:07.900> awkward<00:03:08.140> to<00:03:08.650> get<00:03:08.799> things<00:03:09.099> in

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:09.370 
means is pretty awkward to get things in

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:11.880 
means is pretty awkward to get things in
and<00:03:09.519> out<00:03:09.640> of<00:03:09.940> because<00:03:10.720> as<00:03:10.900> you<00:03:11.080> can<00:03:11.230> see<00:03:11.530> when

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:11.890 
and out of because as you can see when

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:13.559 
and out of because as you can see when
you<00:03:12.010> start<00:03:12.280> loading<00:03:12.459> it<00:03:12.730> this<00:03:12.940> goes<00:03:13.239> down

00:03:13.559 --> 00:03:13.569 
you start loading it this goes down

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:22.490 
you start loading it this goes down
again<00:03:18.900> it's<00:03:19.900> really<00:03:20.200> annoying

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
again it's really annoying

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:26.339 
again it's really annoying
but<00:03:23.500> should<00:03:24.130> that<00:03:24.160> put<00:03:24.819> you<00:03:25.030> off<00:03:25.209> not<00:03:25.959> if<00:03:26.230> you

00:03:26.339 --> 00:03:26.349 
but should that put you off not if you

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:28.050 
but should that put you off not if you
like<00:03:26.500> the<00:03:26.709> look<00:03:26.860> of<00:03:26.980> it<00:03:27.190> and<00:03:27.400> you<00:03:27.940> are

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:28.060 
like the look of it and you are

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:30.479 
like the look of it and you are
attracted<00:03:28.630> to<00:03:28.660> its<00:03:29.079> running<00:03:29.349> costs<00:03:29.890> because

00:03:30.479 --> 00:03:30.489 
attracted to its running costs because

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:34.319 
attracted to its running costs because
these<00:03:30.760> are<00:03:31.150> extremely<00:03:31.900> low
