00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
and the stuff that I would personally

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.330 
and the stuff that I would personally
like<00:00:27.269> the<00:00:27.869> sea<00:00:28.050> fix<00:00:28.349> with<00:00:28.590> killer<00:00:28.890> instinct

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
like the sea fix with killer instinct

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.400 
like the sea fix with killer instinct
and<00:00:29.400> its<00:00:29.609> current<00:00:29.970> state<00:00:30.240> one<00:00:31.050> of<00:00:31.170> the<00:00:31.230> biggest

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
and its current state one of the biggest

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.290 
and its current state one of the biggest
priorities<00:00:32.009> in<00:00:32.130> my<00:00:32.279> opinion<00:00:32.640> is<00:00:32.910> something

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
priorities in my opinion is something

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:34.880 
priorities in my opinion is something
general<00:00:33.780> that<00:00:33.930> has<00:00:34.079> kind<00:00:34.260> of<00:00:34.380> been<00:00:34.530> bugged

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
general that has kind of been bugged

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.500 
general that has kind of been bugged
throughout<00:00:35.219> the<00:00:35.370> entire<00:00:35.670> game<00:00:35.910> ever<00:00:36.149> since<00:00:36.390> it

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
throughout the entire game ever since it

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.720 
throughout the entire game ever since it
came<00:00:36.540> out<00:00:36.719> and<00:00:37.079> it's<00:00:37.590> the<00:00:37.770> difficulty<00:00:38.399> and<00:00:38.610> the

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
came out and it's the difficulty and the

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.360 
came out and it's the difficulty and the
ability<00:00:39.149> to<00:00:39.300> unlock<00:00:39.480> the<00:00:40.110> alternate<00:00:40.739> skins<00:00:41.129> or

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
ability to unlock the alternate skins or

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.580 
ability to unlock the alternate skins or
character<00:00:41.820> colors<00:00:42.239> each<00:00:42.750> character<00:00:43.290> gets<00:00:43.379> up

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
character colors each character gets up

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.110 
character colors each character gets up
to<00:00:43.710> six<00:00:43.980> different<00:00:44.129> colors<00:00:44.460> that<00:00:44.730> you<00:00:44.789> can't

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
to six different colors that you can't

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.090 
to six different colors that you can't
unlock<00:00:45.300> however<00:00:45.899> the<00:00:46.079> bigger<00:00:46.379> issue<00:00:46.649> is<00:00:46.890> that

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
unlock however the bigger issue is that

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.100 
unlock however the bigger issue is that
there's<00:00:47.489> a<00:00:47.879> couple<00:00:48.120> of<00:00:48.360> parameters<00:00:48.539> that<00:00:49.050> are

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
there's a couple of parameters that are

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.410 
there's a couple of parameters that are
pretty<00:00:49.440> difficult<00:00:49.739> to<00:00:50.100> acquire<00:00:50.370> one<00:00:51.149> being

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.160 
rank wins on every single character in
the<00:01:13.650> game<00:01:13.680> right<00:01:14.010> now<00:01:14.070> and<00:01:14.400> I<00:01:14.970> still<00:01:15.390> can't<00:01:15.840> get

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
the game right now and I still can't get

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.080 
the game right now and I still can't get
them<00:01:16.470> so<00:01:16.860> I<00:01:16.890> do<00:01:17.189> want<00:01:17.549> to<00:01:17.640> see<00:01:17.820> a<00:01:17.850> big<00:01:18.060> change

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
there I also think that the requirement

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.249 
there I also think that the requirement
to<00:01:20.460> get<00:01:20.640> that<00:01:20.790> is<00:01:20.939> pretty<00:01:21.180> steep<00:01:21.479> there<00:01:22.049> are<00:01:22.200> a

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
to get that is pretty steep there are a

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:23.960 
to get that is pretty steep there are a
lot<00:01:22.470> of<00:01:22.500> people<00:01:22.890> that<00:01:23.100> will<00:01:23.250> never<00:01:23.280> ever<00:01:23.640> ever

one that I personally would love to see
a<00:02:38.790> change<00:02:39.060> for<00:02:39.390> is<00:02:39.690> the<00:02:39.870> overall<00:02:40.170> matchmaking

00:02:40.759 --> 00:02:40.769 
a change for is the overall matchmaking

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:42.259 
a change for is the overall matchmaking
system<00:02:41.069> in<00:02:41.340> killer<00:02:41.550> instinct<00:02:41.970> and<00:02:42.060> the

00:02:42.259 --> 00:02:42.269 
system in killer instinct and the

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:44.809 
system in killer instinct and the
ranking<00:02:42.660> I<00:02:42.870> do<00:02:43.260> think<00:02:43.860> that<00:02:43.950> the<00:02:44.280> ranked

00:02:44.809 --> 00:02:44.819 
ranking I do think that the ranked

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:47.120 
ranking I do think that the ranked
search<00:02:45.120> options<00:02:45.780> definitely<00:02:46.560> would<00:02:46.739> benefit

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.130 
search options definitely would benefit

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:48.860 
search options definitely would benefit
from<00:02:47.190> you<00:02:47.550> choosing<00:02:48.030> between<00:02:48.150> searching

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
from you choosing between searching

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:51.530 
from you choosing between searching
between<00:02:49.200> ranked<00:02:49.830> any<00:02:50.130> rank<00:02:50.700> same<00:02:51.060> or<00:02:51.299> rank

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
between ranked any rank same or rank

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:54.080 
between ranked any rank same or rank
greater<00:02:51.959> I<00:02:52.290> would<00:02:52.709> love<00:02:53.040> to<00:02:53.100> see<00:02:53.519> that<00:02:53.730> I<00:02:53.760> think

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
greater I would love to see that I think

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:55.430 
greater I would love to see that I think
that's<00:02:54.269> something<00:02:54.420> that<00:02:54.569> is<00:02:54.840> definitely

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:55.440 
that's something that is definitely

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:57.470 
that's something that is definitely
needed<00:02:55.799> as<00:02:56.220> far<00:02:56.280> as<00:02:56.670> matchmaking<00:02:57.180> you<00:02:57.360> with

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:32.730 
unintentional or whatever but I still

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:34.430 
unintentional or whatever but I still
think<00:04:32.940> you<00:04:33.030> should<00:04:33.210> suffer<00:04:33.510> a<00:04:33.540> loss<00:04:33.810> in<00:04:34.140> that

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:34.440 
think you should suffer a loss in that

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:36.050 
think you should suffer a loss in that
case<00:04:34.650> and<00:04:34.980> I<00:04:35.070> think<00:04:35.100> that<00:04:35.370> the<00:04:35.490> person<00:04:35.850> needs

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:36.060 
case and I think that the person needs

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:37.610 
case and I think that the person needs
to<00:04:36.240> own<00:04:36.390> up<00:04:36.420> and<00:04:36.780> do<00:04:37.020> something<00:04:37.050> about<00:04:37.470> it

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:37.620 
to own up and do something about it

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:39.590 
to own up and do something about it
you're<00:04:38.190> not<00:04:38.310> going<00:04:38.490> to<00:04:38.550> lose<00:04:38.730> like<00:04:38.970> a<00:04:39.030> billion

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:39.600 
you're not going to lose like a billion

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:41.000 
you're not going to lose like a billion
points<00:04:39.840> or<00:04:40.140> anything<00:04:40.440> but<00:04:40.530> you<00:04:40.680> should<00:04:40.830> lose

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:41.010 
points or anything but you should lose

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:42.740 
points or anything but you should lose
something<00:04:41.520> you<00:04:41.760> should<00:04:41.910> lose<00:04:42.150> a<00:04:42.390> little<00:04:42.600> bit

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:42.750 
something you should lose a little bit

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:44.660 
something you should lose a little bit
of<00:04:42.840> your<00:04:43.020> progress<00:04:43.230> just<00:04:44.070> to<00:04:44.190> motivate<00:04:44.340> you

to see what other changes are going to

00:05:57.780 --> 00:05:59.660 
to see what other changes are going to
come<00:05:57.990> in<00:05:58.110> store<00:05:58.380> the<00:05:58.860> killer<00:05:59.130> instinct<00:05:59.490> store

00:05:59.660 --> 00:05:59.670 
come in store the killer instinct store

come in store the killer instinct store
is<00:05:59.790> also<00:06:00.030> going<00:06:00.150> to<00:06:00.210> get<00:06:00.330> some<00:06:00.510> updates<00:06:00.870> as<00:06:01.050> far

as unlocks and more so I'm thinking

potentially the killer instinct store

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:07.010 
potentially the killer instinct store
not<00:06:05.310> unlocking<00:06:05.910> things<00:06:06.150> once<00:06:06.480> you<00:06:06.600> get<00:06:06.750> 50
