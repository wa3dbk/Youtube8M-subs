00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:09.799
 volcanic eruption an eruption 

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:12.080
 volcanic is the violent exclusion of 

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:14.600
 magma and lava that come from reserves 

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:16.760
 of relatively close hydrocarbons 

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:18.980
 to the surface these generate 

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:22.870
 seismic movements are produced by the 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:22.870
 tectonic activity of the planet 

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:27.960
 here we have a demonstration 

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:46.070
 a tectonic plate or lithospheric plate 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:47.420
 is a fragment of lithosphere that 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:49.070
 moves like a rigid block without 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:50.810
 present internal training on the 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:52.520
 aste is not now of the earth there are three 

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:54.200
 types of edges you can eat the mind is 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:55.550
 a destructive slow eating edge in the 

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:57.470
 Shock edge between two plates 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:58.780
 tectonics when one gets in the way 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:01.370
 on top of others it is called subduction 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:03.740
 divergent edges an edge or a limit 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:05.810
 different the edge that exists between two 

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:08.060
 tectonic plates that separate with 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:10.280
 Transformant edges edge 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:13.010
 transformante the edge of displacement 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:15.110
 lateral of a tectonic plate respect 

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:17.619
 to the other causing a friction between 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:17.619
 the plates 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:31.619
 if you have medium speed changes the 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.359
 the first is the reaction is the degradation 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:35.549
 and the detachment of a material by 

00:01:33.359 --> 00:01:38.640
 natural example as water one hundred 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:40.409
 seeing by temperature then it has 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.149
 transport 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:43.439
 if it is the thought of the fragments 

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:46.009
 of the material through them 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:48.569
 itineraries last sedimentation 

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:50.340
 is the process in which the material 

00:01:48.569 --> 00:01:52.979
 detached is deposited the bottom of a 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.329
 river in valls the canal and so on 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:56.009
 when natural agents and 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:58.219
 visionaries and transported for 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:58.219
 possible
