00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:08.720
 there 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.950
 we are in the audi dome venue of the 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:28.059
 professionals i think you can too 

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:30.669
 quite right to tell you you were one 

00:00:28.059 --> 00:00:33.010
 training camp with how was that for 

00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:33.910
 So you training camp was one 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:38.890
 absolute highlight 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:40.960
 this summer with three more 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:42.700
 other young players ride because 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:44.500
 many of the bavarian professionals with the 

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:46.300
 national team was championship 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:47.170
 have played 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:49.960
 that was a great one in any case 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:52.480
 experience just such a deep experience 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:54.070
 insight into life and also into such a 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:55.410
 to get professional preparation 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:57.610
 it was very hard 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:00.129
 you could very much from 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:01.989
 Learn the pros and take with them what would be 

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:03.879
 such a thing that you like to lift out 

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:05.590
 Would you like this whole experience? 

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:07.720
 maybe there were any one 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:09.880
 against one duels against the player or 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:12.610
 Maybe it was the whole team 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:15.250
 atmosphere within his team 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:17.080
 such an important season so me 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:20.200
 would say that have already addressed 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:22.539
 The bouncers were all extremely beautiful 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:25.060
 taken by the professionals I understand 

00:01:22.539 --> 00:01:26.950
 I am good with a lot of players 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:28.270
 even more contact with them and 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:30.220
 Of course, when you see each other, it is always 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:32.500
 nice but also have a say and yourself 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:33.880
 can exchange and that was that 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:35.979
 really what impressed me a lot 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:37.240
 just how friendly everyone is in themselves 

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:39.869
 not newly recorded was also just 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:39.869
 as a youth player 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:08.679
 you actually had the honor as well 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:11.170
 to be part of the allstar game of the 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:13.050
 nbbl how was it for you? 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:17.140
 Experiences have you collected there and 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:19.599
 do you feel that you are quoting first 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:22.630
 Troop now belongs to me 

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:23.050
 to get that just nominated 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:26.410
 has been 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:28.269
 I was very happy that was short 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:31.049
 after I had hurt myself and 

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:34.120
 that's why I'm even bigger 

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:37.920
 dominated by the coaches and luckily 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:37.920
 get fit again in time for the event 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:41.910
 a unique experience we are there 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:45.910
 Come on me because I can do the most 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:49.840
 guys national team and of it 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:52.120
 plays in the end and then we are at the 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:55.750
 Telecom Dome arrived in the Bundesliga 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:03:00.030
 hall warmed up there played 5000 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:00.030
 people watched and cheered 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:05.410
 very very great experience really 

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:07.780
 once biggest thing common than before 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:09.340
 I'm saying you have to say that 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:11.230
 they also won so I think so 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:13.060
 South has beaten the north because of that 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:14.860
 about one plus point more or yes that is 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:17.170
 that's very important in the all-star game 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:19.060
 always for the boys that the south the 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:21.460
 north beats meanwhile 61 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:23.530
 for the south, six times seven 

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:28.480
 won only the north because 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:30.970
 of course a location in this too 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:33.040
 good measure should represent good of it 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:34.750
 Of course everyone dreams youth player times 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:37.990
 to play in such a hall 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:39.850
 you play NBBL bayern you play like 

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:41.950
 two to so relatively close to it already 

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:44.080
 the jump to profit what would you do 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:45.850
 give a youth player with the 

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:49.080
 perhaps 14 15 years old and 

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:49.080
 take the same way 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:54.270
 great zeal you always have to 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:56.489
 can motivate 

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:59.930
 Partly in his weaknesses work 

00:03:56.489 --> 00:04:02.030
 work which is usually fun 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:03.590
 then you have to be able to motivate like that always 

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:05.450
 It's not allowed to get into the race 

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:08.780
 start any apologies 

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:10.280
 to look for and then comes mostly from whole 

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:13.129
 alone if you have fun with it 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:17.500
 you have success and hard to work 

00:04:13.129 --> 00:04:17.500
 that's fun, that's all 

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:24.000
 Well
