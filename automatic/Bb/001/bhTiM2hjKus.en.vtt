00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:21.090
 new people my name is called acer and 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:24.119
 I welcome you to 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:26.220
 A new weapons review in Q2 and 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:31.400
 Today I will look at you 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:34.890
 the machine pistols p90 to the p90 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:38.370
 cost 13,000 skills or that 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.900
 corresponding 129 cash and is one 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.900
 typical submachine gun with one 

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:45.300
 a little larger magazine namely 50 of them 

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:47.460
 there are 100 also reserve +50 in the network 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.010
 magazine what the damage is it 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:52.890
 a mediocre granted makes 53 of 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:55.470
 100 damage but has a relatively high 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.090
 Fire rate with 86 out of 100 and 

00:00:55.470 --> 00:01:00.870
 but also a relative one 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:02.340
 high recoil with 56 of 100 below 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.480
 Of course the position suffers 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.909
 precision 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:08.159
 because at 65 out of 100 we are about 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:10.680
 at three-quarters of the possible 100 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:13.020
 points in precision the 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.180
 I also have machine guns p90 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.280
 bought as a second weapon and now 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.380
 Let's look at how plays 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.330
 The whole thing then finally in motion 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.520
 So I have to say I have the p90 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:26.250
 always liked to play but that 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.900
 not on all cards because like her 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.370
 already start could see is 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.370
 this weapon is not exactly the weapon 

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:33.630
 most accurate weapon for the wannabe 

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:36.300
 soldiers out there 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.250
 that is to say so the p90 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:39.540
 is really a very good weapon and 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.550
 you just notice the cabbage 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:44.280
 speed of the balls really because 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:45.930
 the whole wheel just got out of it 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.909
 reason it is the b 90 on a weapon the 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:50.420
 I would rather play from the hip than 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:52.200
 really aim because of the recoil 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:55.190
 actually blurs that eventually 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:57.450
 so much that some are really targeted 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:59.250
 target targeted here and say that 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:02.490
 So that's really targeted 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:04.350
 shooting is not necessarily possible 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.210
 but it is such a weapon rest times 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.860
 just quickly around the corner is likely 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:09.929
 You can shoot through the high ball 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.400
 output you become somebody anyway 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:12.090
 to meet 

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:14.220
 but that's the way it is 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:15.420
 minor damage due to the devices 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:17.430
 this weapon that you more balls 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:19.200
 really needs to kill the enemy 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:20.430
 It is very often that you 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.230
 maybe behind an opponent then 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:23.940
 she goes into the cee mode shoots him in 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:27.370
 the back and somehow you meet the 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:29.349
 not really that has in part 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:31.390
 yes the reason that he hurt very much 

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:33.879
 low the weapon and the other that 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:35.950
 the weapon only really took 

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:37.090
 distances that strengthen his whole strength 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:39.879
 can play out 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:41.260
 because on telly it is really one 

00:02:39.879 --> 00:02:41.830
 I do not kill you at all 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:44.290
 can recommend 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:46.510
 but she is not at all that 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:47.980
 thought so if you are close 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:49.180
 then you can join the opponent 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:51.670
 this weapon the opponent of something 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:53.650
 shred it is almost like that many 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:54.760
 I think they would not be obert 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:57.310
 because she also has her weaknesses though 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:59.950
 accordingly their strengths the 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:02.739
 really not completely neglected 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:06.420
 the plc is one of those weapons the 

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:09.849
 I really like so-called monastery 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:10.599
 Game matches game modes and maps 

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:12.280
 would play 

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:13.810
 Of course it's skil two 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:16.239
 basically so that all cards are right 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:18.430
 small are all set but is 

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:20.500
 for me hanna the perfect card for 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:23.349
 the p90 through the narrow streets through the 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:25.599
 all possibilities to hide 

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:27.159
 around the corner and then the opponent directly 

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:29.560
 to have before you when you are out of the corner 

00:03:27.159 --> 00:03:30.970
 out comes, for example , is indeed 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:32.440
 It is a weapon where you are very lucky 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:33.579
 would have to be with the opponents depending on 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:35.620
 how they attack you 

00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:37.660
 In that it is a weapon for me 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:38.799
 No sense at all because you are 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:40.299
 probably always on something 

00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:41.950
 higher distance with the opponent and 

00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:43.629
 That's why with this weapon 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:46.629
 can not perform well 

00:03:43.629 --> 00:03:47.169
 The reload time of the P90 is extreme 

00:03:46.629 --> 00:03:48.819
 fast 

00:03:47.169 --> 00:03:50.739
 that is really cool and that is 

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:52.450
 so one of those points where i say okay 

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:53.709
 I have to go back to the 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:55.209
 win new weapon because I am yes 

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:56.650
 someone basically after a kill 

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:58.660
 or after such a closed ointment 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:01.540
 like to load this is at 49 at 

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:04.329
 the p90 thanks to the 50 shot magazine not 

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:06.129
 So you really need 23 kills 

00:04:04.329 --> 00:04:07.840
 get you and need to afterwards 

00:04:06.129 --> 00:04:09.310
 load depending on how you have met 

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:12.040
 because as I said it is one 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:13.569
 they are very strong and very many 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:16.419
 cool shoots but accordingly 

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:18.190
 So you do very little harm 

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:20.889
 but can also so that he sometimes one 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:22.630
 or get another headshot and 

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:24.039
 thereby the direct kill with little 

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:25.599
 use of ammunition 

00:04:24.039 --> 00:04:27.580
 however, I would care for everyone 

00:04:25.599 --> 00:04:29.080
 do not leave this case, but rather on it 

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:31.690
 that you need a few more balls and 

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:34.930
 because you are not quite so good for that 

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:36.789
 through this high ball output 

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:38.260
 her also while panning the team 

00:04:36.789 --> 00:04:39.050
 probably pretty much everyone 

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:42.229
 you somehow 

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:44.270
 the kill in total 

00:04:42.229 --> 00:04:46.460
 I played the p90 very much but just stop 

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:48.470
 only on small cards and not in 

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:49.909
 the game modes where you know that the 

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:51.770
 opponent probably takes care of one 

00:04:49.909 --> 00:04:52.940
 longer distances do not wait 

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:54.650
 definitely fight but I'll tell you 

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:57.199
 tactical approach of the opponent that is 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:59.810
 also possible and there are the 

00:04:57.199 --> 00:05:02.509
 clearly better machine guns or 

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:03.620
 or better weapons the p90 is the first 

00:05:02.509 --> 00:05:06.020
 times many trades imagine 

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:07.340
 of course, there is another kind of weapon 

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:07.970
 You can not do that as a storm rifle 

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:10.069
 to compare 

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:11.270
 Nonetheless, I would like you anyway 

00:05:10.069 --> 00:05:13.250
 They recommend if you really still 

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:15.740
 a good weapon for smaller matches 

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:17.150
 for smaller maps needs for single 

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:18.889
 Personally, I also like the weapon 

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:23.060
 Well, because most of the time it is like that 

00:05:18.889 --> 00:05:24.289
 in single mode not very much 

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:27.379
 Long distances see the opponents 

00:05:24.289 --> 00:05:29.060
 but that's all 

00:05:27.379 --> 00:05:30.740
 somewhere in one place and seven for that 

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:32.180
 Run in pretty well today and so on 

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:33.650
 pretty much everyone slams off many 

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:35.419
 have to load after that you do not have to 

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:37.639
 And that is really one of the advantages 

00:05:35.419 --> 00:05:39.229
 this weapon will be us again 

00:05:37.639 --> 00:05:41.419
 been for my little guards 

00:05:39.229 --> 00:05:42.199
 Review with the p90 I'm looking forward to 

00:05:41.419 --> 00:05:43.610
 your comments 

00:05:42.199 --> 00:05:45.349
 think about it let me like one 

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:47.000
 commentary which weapon I then me 

00:05:45.349 --> 00:05:48.469
 should look at next 

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.630
 and maybe we'll see each other in 

00:05:48.469 --> 00:05:54.190
 my next video and until then should 

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:54.190
 I'm here once out
