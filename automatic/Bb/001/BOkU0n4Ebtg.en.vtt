the head you definitely going to start
near<00:03:42.450> the<00:03:42.480> ends<00:03:43.080> the<00:03:43.830> reason<00:03:44.160> I<00:03:44.220> wash<00:03:44.430> my<00:03:44.670> wigs

near the ends the reason I wash my wigs
like<00:03:45.150> this<00:03:45.390> is<00:03:45.690> because<00:03:46.400> it<00:03:47.400> really<00:03:47.850> cuts

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.120 
like this is because it really cuts

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:50.199 
like this is because it really cuts
barrel<00:03:48.569> and<00:03:48.690> are<00:03:48.870> the<00:03:49.050> tangling

00:03:50.199 --> 00:03:50.209 
barrel and are the tangling

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:53.750

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:28.850 
head of the mannequin head and then or

00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:32.020 
head of the mannequin head and then or
just<00:06:29.210> use<00:06:29.360> another<00:06:29.660> one<00:06:29.960> to<00:06:30.950> make<00:06:31.130> sure<00:06:31.400> that

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:32.030 
just use another one to make sure that

00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:34.450 
just use another one to make sure that
the<00:06:32.390> inside<00:06:32.810> of<00:06:32.960> the<00:06:33.020> cap<00:06:33.230> drives<00:06:33.560> as<00:06:33.740> well<00:06:34.010> so

00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:34.460 
the inside of the cap drives as well so

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:37.240 
the inside of the cap drives as well so
it's<00:06:35.270> drying<00:06:35.780> in<00:06:36.050> a<00:06:36.110> straight<00:06:36.410> position<00:06:36.620> it's

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:37.250 
it's drying in a straight position it's

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:39.190 
it's drying in a straight position it's
been<00:06:37.400> washed<00:06:37.670> in<00:06:38.000> a<00:06:38.120> straight<00:06:38.360> position<00:06:38.570> so<00:06:39.110> it

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:39.200 
been washed in a straight position so it

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:40.840 
been washed in a straight position so it
really<00:06:39.470> cuts<00:06:39.740> down<00:06:39.980> on<00:06:40.220> the<00:06:40.370> amount<00:06:40.460> of

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:40.850 
really cuts down on the amount of

00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:43.300 
really cuts down on the amount of
tangles<00:06:41.390> that<00:06:41.450> you're<00:06:41.630> gonna<00:06:41.720> have<00:06:42.020> so<00:06:42.800> I<00:06:43.160> hope
