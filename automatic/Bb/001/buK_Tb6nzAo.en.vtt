of<00:01:47.909> modern<00:01:47.970> art<00:01:48.360> stores<00:01:48.780> and<00:01:49.650> this<00:01:49.799> is<00:01:49.920> a<00:01:49.950> very

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
of modern art stores and this is a very

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.969 
of modern art stores and this is a very
similar<00:01:50.549> pattern<00:01:51.110> that<00:01:52.110> she<00:01:52.380> that<00:01:52.650> her<00:01:52.830> other

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
similar pattern that she that her other

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.730 
similar pattern that she that her other
products<00:01:53.460> carry<00:01:53.689> and<00:01:54.689> it's<00:01:54.930> actually<00:01:55.259> a<00:01:55.290> woven

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.620 
products carry and it's actually a woven
vinyl<00:01:55.799> so<00:01:56.549> it's<00:01:56.670> a<00:01:56.729> textile<00:01:57.150> instead<00:01:57.479> of<00:01:57.540> a

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
vinyl so it's a textile instead of a
