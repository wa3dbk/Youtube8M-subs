00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.419
 hey people and welcome to 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:04.859
 this new video 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:06.779
 In this video I want to show you 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:10.010
 like you with your windows 8 pc 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:10.010
 can create hotspot 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:22.189
 so at 107 against the whole one more 

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:25.029
 a bit easier you could 

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:27.710
 namely, simply enter the hog and 

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:28.450
 then a computer to computer network 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:32.540
 create 

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:34.520
 unfortunately this does not work anymore 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:37.640
 but you can still do it 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:39.649
 So create a hotspot by doing that 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:41.809
 about cmd makes you just need it 

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:43.250
 you see these three commands here in the 

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:44.510
 description and if you just that 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:47.120
 You can forget all about it 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:49.900
 save this video and just always 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:55.280
 look again in the description 

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:57.770
 First , CMG administrator opened the 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:02.989
 First command I want to show you 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:05.360
 he does that here and that's easy 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:08.210
 just to check if your network 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:09.520
 So this technique really supports 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:11.210
 create a hotspot 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:12.860
 then you can do the whole thing 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:15.109
 save work and you can easily 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:17.299
 nachgucken is supported here 

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:20.109
 hosted networks and here it is 

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:24.020
 that means my calculator can do it all 

00:01:20.109 --> 00:01:25.999
 and from there you can just go 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:27.399
 carry on with the second command that 

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:31.850
 is this one here 

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:34.429
 With that you create the network ssid 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:36.289
 the name of the network that stands here 

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:37.450
 now for example these are the whole 

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:42.709
 names 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:46.399
 I'll just take video then 

00:01:42.709 --> 00:01:47.600
 you only need video then you need 

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:52.579
 just a blank 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:56.420
 such a blank and as a password 

00:01:52.579 --> 00:02:02.299
 I'll just take 1 2 3 4 5 6 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:07.039
 7 8 then I copy the whole lies 

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:11.090
 that one here and then you see that 

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:13.099
 whole is successful and now it has to 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:13.910
 network just start after it 

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:16.160
 was created 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:19.819
 for that you need the third command 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:21.910
 you just feel like this here and there 

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:24.880
 network was started 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:27.310
 as you can see the network is now 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:28.660
 already visible if you agree with it 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:30.940
 would connect the whole 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:32.530
 however, they do not bring anything 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:34.090
 he does not have internet connection about it yet 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:35.860
 that means you only get your value 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:37.270
 the pc would have connected but no 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:40.480
 internet and that's nothing in 

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:42.460
 the thing and therefore still have to 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:46.060
 go on and do it in the 

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:48.640
 I should get this here 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:51.720
 subcategory thanks the under network 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:55.810
 and internet network at the release center 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:59.140
 and opens the adapter settings so 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:00.940
 then you see here is one that is mine 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:01.690
 Country cable can also be quite nice here 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:04.120
 recognize the picture 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:06.910
 lan connection three at the description 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:08.290
 send video this is our network what 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:09.760
 you have created us is synonymous of 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:13.030
 microsoft hosted virtual 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:13.600
 network adapter yes and here are still 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:14.770
 three 

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:16.000
 the three have not we now 

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:18.820
 that's interesting once the wifi 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:23.680
 and from a virtual machine the 

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:25.840
 both yes the two internet ports 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:27.910
 but this relatively uninteresting 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:30.640
 we are dealing with these two 

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:33.850
 and we want that this 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:36.160
 internet over here is going on 

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:38.770
 this year which is our hotspot 

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:40.450
 is all the one with this hotspot 

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:44.370
 connected are also internet 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:46.840
 you click on your internet 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:50.260
 characteristics or on our lan 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:52.030
 connection properties release and 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:53.380
 activates this point to others 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:55.620
 allow users in the network 

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:57.400
 this connection of the computer as 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:04:00.730
 to use internet connections 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:03.040
 that activates you select one here 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:04.870
 network connection from here you can see 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:10.030
 alan connection 3 so if we too 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:12.400
 off clicks ok and from now stands here 

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:13.770
 also shared that means off 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:16.540
 Now you have an internet connection 

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:19.080
 and if I am with the 

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:19.080
 connect network 

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:26.280
 then you see, I am already 

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:31.600
 connected up here 

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:34.030
 wlan and I can now easily into the 

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:36.280
 go weather and you see this now 

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:42.190
 Updated weather for spain carlitz 

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:44.200
 now 17 o'clock soon 18 o'clock around the weather 

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:45.910
 also agrees with the time here 

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:48.340
 my iphone is now 17 03 

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:50.380
 So that fits and then I would too 

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:52.000
 say that's it then for this week me 

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:53.320
 Hope you liked it if so then 

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.670
 it shows me with an assessment 

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:58.980
 and then see you next week 

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:58.980
 again bite then skin in
