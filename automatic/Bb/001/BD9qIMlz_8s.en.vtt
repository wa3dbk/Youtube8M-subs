this<00:02:05.820> is<00:02:06.000> also<00:02:06.210> due<00:02:06.540> to<00:02:06.600> water<00:02:06.840> penetration

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:08.000 
this is also due to water penetration

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.340 
this is also due to water penetration
probably<00:02:09.000> around<00:02:09.330> the<00:02:09.510> rim<00:02:09.720> of<00:02:09.750> the<00:02:10.020> East
