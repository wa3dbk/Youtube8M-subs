00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
salt lining on the inside that keeps it

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:27.109 
salt lining on the inside that keeps it
nice<00:00:24.810> and<00:00:24.869> soft<00:00:25.260> it<00:00:26.250> also<00:00:26.430> comes<00:00:26.820> with<00:00:26.939> a<00:00:27.090> very

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
nice and soft it also comes with a very

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.750 
nice and soft it also comes with a very
nice<00:00:27.689> hood<00:00:28.199> which<00:00:29.070> actually<00:00:29.460> serves<00:00:29.550> a

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
nice hood which actually serves a

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.910 
nice hood which actually serves a
purpose<00:00:30.000> the<00:00:30.869> hood<00:00:31.019> actually<00:00:31.260> blocks<00:00:31.710> out

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
purpose the hood actually blocks out

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.790 
purpose the hood actually blocks out
quite<00:00:32.250> a<00:00:32.279> bit<00:00:32.369> on<00:00:32.579> white<00:00:33.290> excess<00:00:34.290> late

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
quite a bit on white excess late

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.750 
quite a bit on white excess late
that's<00:00:35.040> I<00:00:35.219> needed<00:00:35.969> because<00:00:36.469> you'll<00:00:37.469> get<00:00:38.430> the

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
that's I needed because you'll get the

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.970 
that's I needed because you'll get the
really<00:00:39.000> nasty<00:00:39.210> icky<00:00:39.840> flare<00:00:40.110> so<00:00:40.410> nobody<00:00:40.890> ever

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
really nasty icky flare so nobody ever

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:46.729 
really nasty icky flare so nobody ever
wants<00:00:42.950> so<00:00:43.950> the<00:00:44.820> lens<00:00:45.180> is<00:00:45.480> in<00:00:45.719> a<00:00:45.899> push-pull

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
wants so the lens is in a push-pull

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.940 
wants so the lens is in a push-pull
configuration<00:00:47.750> which<00:00:48.750> means<00:00:49.020> there's<00:00:49.739> no

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
configuration which means there's no

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.630 
configuration which means there's no
actually<00:00:50.539> then<00:00:51.539> you<00:00:51.690> turn<00:00:52.050> to<00:00:52.649> zoom<00:00:52.860> and

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
actually then you turn to zoom and

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.610 
actually then you turn to zoom and
pushing<00:00:54.090> it<00:00:54.210> in<00:00:54.360> and<00:00:54.780> out<00:00:54.870> like<00:00:55.140> it<00:00:55.289> is<00:00:55.379> right

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
pushing it in and out like it is right

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:03.349 
pushing it in and out like it is right
now<00:00:56.180> okay<00:00:58.850> the<00:00:59.850> lens<00:01:00.480> hood<00:01:00.780> is<00:01:01.079> very<00:01:01.910> very<00:01:02.910> easy

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
now okay the lens hood is very very easy

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.170 
now okay the lens hood is very very easy

lens hood and fully deep channels turn

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:24.510 
lens hood and fully deep channels turn
at<00:01:21.880> 100<00:01:22.300> millimetres<00:01:22.780> is<00:01:23.590> it<00:01:23.800> about<00:01:24.100> the<00:01:24.310> same

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:24.520 
at 100 millimetres is it about the same

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:27.530 
at 100 millimetres is it about the same
as<00:01:24.670> a<00:01:24.700> 72<00:01:25.480> going<00:01:25.660> to<00:01:25.750> be<00:01:25.870> a<00:01:26.020> little<00:01:26.320> bit<00:01:26.470> more

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
as a 72 going to be a little bit more

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:33.930 
as a 72 going to be a little bit more
so<00:01:28.540> here<00:01:29.610> be<00:01:30.610> the<00:01:31.390> optics<00:01:31.870> on<00:01:32.170> me<00:01:32.560> 100<00:01:33.310> of<00:01:33.400> 400

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:33.940 
so here be the optics on me 100 of 400

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:38.040 
so here be the optics on me 100 of 400
are<00:01:34.620> spectacular<00:01:35.620> I<00:01:36.420> have<00:01:37.420> heard<00:01:37.690> their

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:38.050 
are spectacular I have heard their

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:42.780 
are spectacular I have heard their
versions<00:01:38.590> that<00:01:38.740> are<00:01:38.890> not<00:01:39.280> as<00:01:39.580> good<00:01:40.440> but<00:01:41.440> I<00:01:41.790> must

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:42.790 
versions that are not as good but I must

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:46.320 
versions that are not as good but I must
have<00:01:42.940> gotten<00:01:43.150> a<00:01:43.330> nice<00:01:43.540> copy<00:01:43.930> this<00:01:44.490> -<00:01:45.490> supership

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:46.330 
have gotten a nice copy this - supership

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:48.540 
have gotten a nice copy this - supership
it's<00:01:46.570> almost<00:01:46.750> sure<00:01:47.050> Brad<00:01:47.290> 400<00:01:47.890> millimeters<00:01:48.370> in

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:48.550 
it's almost sure Brad 400 millimeters in

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:52.460 
it's almost sure Brad 400 millimeters in
it<00:01:48.640> is<00:01:48.760> 7<00:01:49.000> 100<00:01:49.479> and<00:01:50.050> I<00:01:50.140> know<00:01:50.200> my<00:01:50.979> pixel<00:01:51.520> fee<00:01:51.640> per

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
it is 7 100 and I know my pixel fee per

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:59.330 
it is 7 100 and I know my pixel fee per
pixel<00:01:53.470> pixel<00:01:54.430> people<00:01:56.250> so<00:01:57.250> the<00:01:58.090> lens<00:01:58.930> has<00:01:59.229> a

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
pixel pixel people so the lens has a

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.270 
pixel pixel people so the lens has a
smooth<00:02:00.340> the<00:02:00.670> tight<00:02:01.000> ring<00:02:01.440> which<00:02:02.440> adjusts<00:02:03.130> the

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:03.280 
smooth the tight ring which adjusts the

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:05.330 
smooth the tight ring which adjusts the
tension<00:02:03.610> onto<00:02:04.240> the<00:02:04.330> barrel<00:02:04.720> of<00:02:04.840> the<00:02:04.930> lens

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
tension onto the barrel of the lens

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.010 
tension onto the barrel of the lens
which<00:02:06.340> makes<00:02:06.610> it<00:02:06.729> so<00:02:06.940> then<00:02:07.120> the<00:02:07.660> lens<00:02:07.840> won't

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:08.020 
which makes it so then the lens won't

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:10.560 
which makes it so then the lens won't
slide<00:02:08.470> down<00:02:08.770> when<00:02:09.310> you<00:02:09.399> want<00:02:09.670> it<00:02:09.820> if<00:02:10.270> you<00:02:10.360> don't

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:10.570 
slide down when you want it if you don't

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:12.930 
slide down when you want it if you don't
want<00:02:10.780> to<00:02:11.020> or<00:02:11.590> you<00:02:11.680> can<00:02:11.830> lock<00:02:12.070> it<00:02:12.220> up<00:02:12.340> so<00:02:12.640> if

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940 
want to or you can lock it up so if

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:15.150 
want to or you can lock it up so if
you're<00:02:13.120> gonna<00:02:13.240> want<00:02:13.480> it<00:02:13.660> like<00:02:13.810> kind<00:02:14.590> of<00:02:14.680> set

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:15.160 
you're gonna want it like kind of set
