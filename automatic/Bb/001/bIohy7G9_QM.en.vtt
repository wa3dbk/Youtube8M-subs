there cheese and caramel just in case
anybody<00:04:48.770> was<00:04:48.830> wondering<00:04:49.220> spot<00:04:50.000> could

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:50.150 
anybody was wondering spot could

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:52.239 
anybody was wondering spot could
actually<00:04:50.360> try<00:04:50.570> them<00:04:50.780> both<00:04:50.900> at<00:04:51.110> the<00:04:51.200> same<00:04:51.380> time

00:04:52.239 --> 00:04:52.249 
actually try them both at the same time

00:04:52.249 --> 00:05:02.859 
actually try them both at the same time
here<00:04:52.699> we<00:04:52.789> go<00:04:52.909> I<00:05:00.789> think<00:05:01.789> the<00:05:01.909> I<00:05:02.209> think<00:05:02.719> the

00:05:02.859 --> 00:05:02.869 
here we go I think the I think the

00:05:02.869 --> 00:05:06.039 
here we go I think the I think the
caramel<00:05:03.409> really<00:05:03.769> offsets<00:05:04.009> the<00:05:04.819> flavor<00:05:05.749> of<00:05:05.869> the

00:05:06.039 --> 00:05:06.049 
caramel really offsets the flavor of the

00:05:06.049 --> 00:05:07.689 
caramel really offsets the flavor of the
cheddar<00:05:06.289> they<00:05:06.709> do<00:05:06.769> surprisingly<00:05:07.369> work<00:05:07.519> very

00:05:07.689 --> 00:05:07.699 
cheddar they do surprisingly work very

00:05:07.699 --> 00:05:09.039 
cheddar they do surprisingly work very
well<00:05:07.789> together<00:05:08.029> because<00:05:08.299> the<00:05:08.629> caramel<00:05:09.019> is

00:05:09.039 --> 00:05:09.049 
well together because the caramel is

00:05:09.049 --> 00:05:10.989 
well together because the caramel is
adding<00:05:09.379> a<00:05:09.469> sweetness<00:05:10.039> that<00:05:10.609> the<00:05:10.729> cheddar

00:05:10.989 --> 00:05:10.999 
adding a sweetness that the cheddar

00:05:10.999 --> 00:05:14.529 
adding a sweetness that the cheddar
didn't<00:05:11.419> really<00:05:11.719> have<00:05:12.669> together<00:05:13.669> I'm<00:05:14.179> really

00:05:14.529 --> 00:05:14.539 
didn't really have together I'm really

00:05:14.539 --> 00:05:16.599 
didn't really have together I'm really
surprised<00:05:14.959> that<00:05:15.259> they<00:05:15.349> actually<00:05:15.439> work<00:05:15.859> so

00:05:16.599 --> 00:05:16.609 
surprised that they actually work so

00:05:16.609 --> 00:05:19.269 
surprised that they actually work so
well<00:05:16.909> together<00:05:17.799> but<00:05:18.799> that's<00:05:18.949> actually<00:05:19.099> a

00:05:19.269 --> 00:05:19.279 
well together but that's actually a

00:05:19.279 --> 00:05:22.299 
well together but that's actually a
pretty<00:05:19.309> good<00:05:19.579> pop<00:05:19.999> for<00:05:20.559> pretty<00:05:21.559> big<00:05:21.739> bag<00:05:21.919> too<00:05:22.279> i
