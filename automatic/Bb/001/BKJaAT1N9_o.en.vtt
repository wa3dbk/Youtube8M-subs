 I would like to look up stories about this 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:25.600
 systematize knowledge by speaking 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:28.120
 only negative spills on people 

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:30.280

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:39.130
 experience in response silence i understand that 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:41.020
 precisely scrupulous delicate topics 

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:43.120

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:47.500
 magic cards and the span will now 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:49.720
 work through all possible options for 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:53.680
 to the side of your dreams 

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:56.400
 so girl yes this girl is not written 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:59.490
 person 

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:00.840
 on the forum trying to get information about 

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:04.460
 political asylum 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:07.439

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:09.899
 scolded say in this rogues we all 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:12.990
 honest but here's a fair game period i 

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:16.469
 compose stories about it still at 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:21.390
 participating council asking us but how am i 

00:01:16.469 --> 00:01:24.119
 I understand what it is and how it is in 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:27.750
 mass consciousness there is a feeling 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:30.539
 that here they say people who get 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.729
 political asylum they have them there 

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:36.750
 some stories if not true it is you 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:38.880
 so on it is not pure and therefore 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:42.220
 this one with which the girl faced or 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:45.340
 young man we don't know the gender 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:49.170
 what to say i am very pleased that 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:51.430
 lately this topic has appeared 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:54.780
 decent materials in particular 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:58.080
 book mister schools him which we 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:02:01.750
 promoted the channel we have an interview with 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:03.310
 by the author and she costs 50 dollars there I 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:05.470
 do you really care 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:10.119
 she she costs much more at the very 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:11.710
 In fact, no expense at all but people appeared 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:14.350
 which is the old normal language 

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:16.980
 human describe the crux of the matter page 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:19.870
 she was very long hidden and 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:21.040
 passed either like this to some not 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:24.340
 next and days 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:26.470
 either there chika brought down not understand 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:30.690
 what and so on really was not 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:30.690
 the source is now brought beech weaving and 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:37.599
 appeared not in the form of luring the shop from 

00:02:35.079 --> 00:02:39.370
 such commercial I did not because of how it is possible 

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:42.280
 and such bloggers call it 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:47.680
 commercial lured in to on youtube I 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:50.220
 I am not a specialist 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:52.840
 licensed by some here there 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:56.769
 promises to call back on the psyche 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:58.750
 It represents all of this as it were, too 

00:02:56.769 --> 00:03:01.150
 such a tied up but here again now 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:04.319
 quite a lot of information I take on 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:06.250
 vector commitment to invite people 

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:09.040
 who have something to say about 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:13.359
 political asylum and I take over 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:16.510
 answered asking straightforward questions 

00:03:13.359 --> 00:03:21.280
 unit unambiguous so that the essence 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:24.129
 the question was revealed well and I will say 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:27.819
 that today we have on this subject 

00:03:24.129 --> 00:03:29.260
 well, probably five six stories the most 

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:31.720
 tracks and 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:34.209
 and from the people who got 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:37.000
 political asylum and here is tatyana 

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:40.090
 bogdanova over chambers she is not directly too 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:42.000
 indirectly there were three topics there yet 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:43.870
 there will be people i have if print 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.820
 who are ready 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:48.569
 share 

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:51.200
 so 

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:54.060
 one thing to say every single thing 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:57.030
 no matter someone is whispering 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:04:01.109
 snorts it up to you, we just as it is every 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:04.260
 thing requires analysis and understanding ie 

00:04:01.109 --> 00:04:07.769
 say this is bad or is it not me 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:09.780
 good because I blood there obviously here 

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:12.780
 I don't fall into this category all the time 

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:14.549
 heard from when people say i can't 

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:16.979
 apply for political bercha because 

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:20.489
 that me i would obviously nobody there 

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:22.349
 harass it there personally and I want 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:24.120
 say that maybe she can 

00:04:22.349 --> 00:04:26.220
 be it wrong because you are alive in 

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:29.759
 some country and he is his categories 

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:32.039
 and snakes he lets himself second 

00:04:29.759 --> 00:04:34.699
 might not have given a car to a country 

00:04:32.039 --> 00:04:37.229
 say may be given, and because 

00:04:34.699 --> 00:04:39.389
 completely different measurement system from 

00:04:37.229 --> 00:04:40.729
 ratings and so on so you don't understand 

00:04:39.389 --> 00:04:44.520
 not a thing 

00:04:40.729 --> 00:04:46.530
 interested in and take it and we like 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:48.180
 channel which is pretty much 

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:50.520
 immigration and not only need u 

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:55.020
 pretty much we of course on this 

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:59.880
 the topic will be all the materials that I like 

00:04:55.020 --> 00:05:03.060
 I will find it useful we will post those 

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:05.699
 who is offended that someone is there somewhere 

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:07.919
 on snort in there or something you on them not 

00:05:05.699 --> 00:05:09.539
 hurt they they just might too 

00:05:07.919 --> 00:05:11.909
 have not admitted they where what you 

00:05:09.539 --> 00:05:12.650
 heard yourself never a drop there 

00:05:11.909 --> 00:05:15.139
 is not 

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:16.759
 below, but there is also 100 thousand 

00:05:15.139 --> 00:05:18.650
 you know what I really am 

00:05:16.759 --> 00:05:21.199
 the platform talked about the forest there very 

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:23.870
 practically for the first time of the day and I saw a very 

00:05:21.199 --> 00:05:28.910
 a lot of people come here like that 

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:31.430
 forum we write this text type guys i 

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:33.320

00:05:40.039 --> 00:05:44.900
 You can paint over there under the victim 

00:05:43.009 --> 00:05:47.750
 so get political asylum 

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:51.410
 here such messages delete them 

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:54.680
 mop up and so on, but itâ€™s also like 

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:56.090
 say when leaving with normal 

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:58.400
 questions come but the same 

00:05:56.090 --> 00:06:02.449
 the place is like starting to belong 

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:04.669
 under this category of strange people like 

00:06:02.449 --> 00:06:05.990
 not quite adequate note so i dont 

00:06:04.669 --> 00:06:07.850

 she is just looking for places where these topics 

00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:11.240
 are discussed more freely but in all sorts 

00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:14.080
