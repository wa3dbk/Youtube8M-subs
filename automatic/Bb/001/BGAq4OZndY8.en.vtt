 canadian flags

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:14.280

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:54.520
 we are but 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:01.740
 one

 b 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:04.739
 smart 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:13.360
 Alice 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:17.740
 one 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:19.920
 I'm taking a bath 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:19.920
 with 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:57.720
 smart 

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:00.160
 guys 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:05.569
 from girl 

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:08.880
 and 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:12.660
 myself 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:17.710
 quite 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:20.400
 with 

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:20.400
 slaro 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:23.680
 if a 

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:39.249
 not every time after hire to feel 

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:41.529
 the window they rode minutes can not call 

00:04:39.249 --> 00:04:43.389
 this game I tried them 

00:04:41.529 --> 00:04:45.969
 watched the complete good it plays 

00:04:43.389 --> 00:04:47.349
 know this is not a game you know so this 

00:04:45.969 --> 00:04:49.240
 inner culture is inner 

00:04:47.349 --> 00:04:52.629
 condition can be a huge job 

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:54.189
 maybe someone can not believe that you 

00:04:52.629 --> 00:04:55.810
 you know nobody believes it is huge 

00:04:54.189 --> 00:04:59.020
 work although I know that this is a huge 

00:04:55.810 --> 00:05:01.360
 work is huge work in all respects 

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:04.120
 but once again I am a king that these are skaters 

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:06.099
 which can be put anything and what 

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:08.529
 please, and they will not be fulfilled 

00:05:06.099 --> 00:05:12.490
 yes they and they are very fertile material 

00:05:08.529 --> 00:05:14.229
 very rich material just to find 

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:16.990
 such material besides the fact that 

00:05:14.229 --> 00:05:18.610
 talented and taken away from you home lens and 

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:21.490
 only translation to load with trainer and 

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:23.849
 educators and choreographer naturally plus 

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:26.349
 more to all of course all this here 

00:05:23.849 --> 00:05:28.319
 maybe today it was absolutely possible 

00:05:26.349 --> 00:05:31.089
 for scribing and flax I am a pair of tea pair 

00:05:28.319 --> 00:05:33.159
 you can say she is powerful and she is gentle on 

00:05:31.089 --> 00:05:34.779
 it ask me a question I'm all 

00:05:33.159 --> 00:05:38.740
 I look and understand myself I can not 

00:05:34.779 --> 00:05:41.199
 still in this pair is stronger who pulls 

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:43.089
 understand here we are ready to pour out there 

00:05:41.199 --> 00:05:45.759
 nevertheless it is clear there chad technically 

00:05:43.089 --> 00:05:49.139
 harder yes and he does the amount of work 

00:05:45.759 --> 00:05:49.139
 more than mazda 

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:54.070
 and here and there you have a means to do 

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:57.580
 I agree absolutely correct question 

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:59.290
 they alternate from where he leads them 

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:00.760
 the moment of the region leads that is so 

00:05:59.290 --> 00:06:02.650
 once we go on the right desk why 

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:04.870
 like the program you need to demolish 

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:06.940
 crow interesting she is interesting hand 

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:09.670
 for the same reason a partnership 

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:11.710
 before he obeys she and u have led on 

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:13.270
 his mother, like the way he took to 

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:15.640
 material to watch therefore the whole program 

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:17.290
 smoothly that's the mastery 

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:21.250
 setting program to it from all 

00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:23.050
 angles looks beautifully beautiful 

00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:26.560
 fully natural everything is so complicated 

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:28.900
 support yes how that is leading he her 

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:31.240
 lucky ah she obeyed him tribute 

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:33.250
 beautiful beautiful yes is in support 

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:33.970
 incredible couple of course they are in the past 

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:37.180
 year 

00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:39.340
 lost gold world championship steel 

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:41.410
 the second for the most part it was this 

00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:45.010
 the hardest season explanation was last 

00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:48.600
 for them because the sore is one after 

00:06:45.010 --> 00:06:51.820
 other and trauma lt with scott problem and 

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:53.950
 third 34 to what they win 

00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:56.350
 they are very confident you are much more 

00:06:53.950 --> 00:06:59.770
 and much there about 10 points 9 

00:06:56.350 --> 00:07:02.770
 108 255 they know their feelings peacefully 

00:06:59.770 --> 00:07:06.130
 what they knew stoos by 112 they got 

00:07:02.770 --> 00:07:08.250
 grand prix finals and when he saw him 

00:07:06.130 --> 00:07:10.540
 his reaction was we lost 

00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:13.330
 American his reaction was cattle not 

00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:15.310
 knew that the less you put 

00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:17.640
 seen jest marina zueva showed that 

00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:17.640
 here
