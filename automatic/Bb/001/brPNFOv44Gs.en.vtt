00:00:07.579 --> 00:00:07.589 
to create the flat bottom effect seeing

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:12.110 
to create the flat bottom effect seeing
that<00:00:07.919> several<00:00:08.550> people<00:00:08.580> have<00:00:10.610> some<00:00:11.610> difficulty

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
create the flat bottom with you would go

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.929 
create the flat bottom with you would go
keep<00:00:21.029> it<00:00:21.210> inside<00:00:22.140> out<00:00:22.320> and<00:00:22.560> go<00:00:23.369> into<00:00:23.820> the

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
keep it inside out and go into the

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:29.390 
keep it inside out and go into the
corner<00:00:24.390> to<00:00:25.820> line<00:00:26.820> up<00:00:27.060> the<00:00:27.449> bottom<00:00:28.019> seam<00:00:28.859> with

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
corner to line up the bottom seam with

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.620 
corner to line up the bottom seam with
the<00:00:29.580> side<00:00:29.849> seam<00:00:30.590> pushing<00:00:31.590> it<00:00:31.710> down<00:00:31.890> flat<00:00:32.630> and

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
the side seam pushing it down flat and

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.670 
the side seam pushing it down flat and
then<00:00:34.559> looking<00:00:35.070> inside<00:00:35.670> it<00:00:35.940> to<00:00:36.300> be<00:00:37.050> sure<00:00:37.320> that

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
then looking inside it to be sure that

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.740 
then looking inside it to be sure that
the<00:00:39.800> side<00:00:40.800> seam<00:00:41.160> and<00:00:41.460> the<00:00:41.730> and<00:00:41.969> bottom<00:00:42.510> seam

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
the side seam and the and bottom seam

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.779 
the side seam and the and bottom seam
are<00:00:43.520> lined<00:00:44.520> up<00:00:44.700> perfectly<00:00:45.539> because<00:00:46.610> it<00:00:47.610> looks

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
are lined up perfectly because it looks

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:52.580 
are lined up perfectly because it looks
better<00:00:49.190> from<00:00:50.190> there<00:00:50.629> follow<00:00:51.629> the<00:00:51.960> tutorial<00:00:52.469> on

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
better from there follow the tutorial on

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.580 
better from there follow the tutorial on
what<00:00:53.010> it<00:00:53.129> says<00:00:53.399> one<00:00:53.910> inch<00:00:54.120> or<00:00:54.539> sometimes<00:00:55.320> it's

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
what it says one inch or sometimes it's

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.369 
what it says one inch or sometimes it's
bigger<00:00:56.070> for<00:00:56.190> the<00:00:56.489> larger<00:00:56.789> totes<00:00:57.059> and<00:00:57.390> just

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
bigger for the larger totes and just

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.450 
bigger for the larger totes and just
simply<00:00:58.859> sew

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:00.460 
simply sew

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:11.040 
simply sew
down

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:11.050 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:16.800 

repeat<00:01:12.010> with<00:01:12.490> the<00:01:12.520> other<00:01:12.790> side

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:16.810 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:20.730 

again<00:01:17.409> looking<00:01:17.979> inside<00:01:18.369> to<00:01:19.110> see<00:01:20.110> that<00:01:20.380> it<00:01:20.500> is

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:20.740 
again looking inside to see that it is

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:31.380 
again looking inside to see that it is
lined<00:01:21.280> up<00:01:23.880> so<00:01:28.830> always<00:01:29.830> back<00:01:30.220> stitch<00:01:30.729> you<00:01:31.240> don't

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:31.390 
lined up so always back stitch you don't

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:37.020 
lined up so always back stitch you don't
want<00:01:31.630> your<00:01:31.840> spoon<00:01:32.320> to<00:01:32.560> come<00:01:32.770> out<00:01:35.670> trim<00:01:36.670> the

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:37.030 
want your spoon to come out trim the

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:41.900 
want your spoon to come out trim the
corner

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:41.910 

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:45.750 

flat-bottomed<00:01:42.910> as<00:01:43.510> you<00:01:43.780> can<00:01:43.960> see<00:01:44.200> and<00:01:44.760> when

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:45.760 
flat-bottomed as you can see and when

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:48.600 
flat-bottomed as you can see and when
you<00:01:45.910> turn<00:01:46.150> it<00:01:46.180> right-side<00:01:46.660> out<00:01:47.020> obviously<00:01:47.830> I'm

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:48.610 
you turn it right-side out obviously I'm

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:51.030 
you turn it right-side out obviously I'm
just<00:01:49.000> using<00:01:49.480> a<00:01:49.750> really<00:01:50.080> tiny<00:01:50.290> piece<00:01:50.590> of<00:01:50.620> fabric

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:51.040 
just using a really tiny piece of fabric

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:54.240 
just using a really tiny piece of fabric
here<00:01:51.310> and<00:01:51.970> it's<00:01:52.210> not<00:01:52.710> anywhere<00:01:53.710> near<00:01:53.770> the<00:01:54.040> size

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:54.250 
here and it's not anywhere near the size

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:56.490 
here and it's not anywhere near the size
of<00:01:54.430> any<00:01:54.700> of<00:01:55.030> the<00:01:55.270> bags<00:01:55.810> that<00:01:56.110> you<00:01:56.170> would<00:01:56.410> be

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:56.500 
of any of the bags that you would be

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:00.000 
of any of the bags that you would be
creating<00:01:57.420> but<00:01:58.420> you<00:01:58.720> can<00:01:58.930> see<00:01:59.170> that<00:01:59.410> it<00:01:59.560> creates

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:00.010 
creating but you can see that it creates

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:04.200 
creating but you can see that it creates
the<00:02:00.430> flat<00:02:00.760> bottom<00:02:01.320> effect<00:02:02.320> and<00:02:02.970> it's<00:02:03.970> pretty

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:04.210 
the flat bottom effect and it's pretty

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:05.570 
the flat bottom effect and it's pretty
simple

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:05.580 
simple

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:10.020 
simple
got<00:02:06.580> to<00:02:06.700> try<00:02:06.850> not<00:02:06.910> to<00:02:07.210> overthink<00:02:07.540> it
