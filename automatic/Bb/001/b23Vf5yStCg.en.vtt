hue and saturation and from here you can

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:34.980 
hue and saturation and from here you can
change<00:02:32.480> the<00:02:32.750> color<00:02:32.959> as<00:02:33.110> much<00:02:33.319> indeed<00:02:33.650> like

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:34.990 
change the color as much indeed like

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:40.570 
change the color as much indeed like
like<00:02:35.990> this<00:02:36.760> so<00:02:37.760> we<00:02:37.880> wanted<00:02:38.150> a<00:02:38.239> blue<00:02:38.510> and<00:02:39.580> you

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:40.580 
like this so we wanted a blue and you

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:43.990 
like this so we wanted a blue and you
would<00:02:40.700> get<00:02:40.880> something<00:02:41.120> like<00:02:41.420> that

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:44.000 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.770 

and<00:02:44.090> also<00:02:44.960> another<00:02:45.440> way<00:02:45.710> to<00:02:45.770> do<00:02:46.010> it<00:02:46.040> is<00:02:46.450> if<00:02:47.450> you

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:47.780 
and also another way to do it is if you

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:51.760 
and also another way to do it is if you
had<00:02:48.230> that<00:02:48.440> selected<00:02:49.010> and<00:02:50.200> let's<00:02:51.200> go<00:02:51.350> up<00:02:51.380> to

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:51.770 
had that selected and let's go up to

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:55.240 
had that selected and let's go up to
history<00:02:52.730> is<00:02:52.850> just<00:02:53.090> go<00:02:53.210> back<00:02:53.240> one<00:02:53.660> step<00:02:53.810> if<00:02:54.710> you

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:55.250 
history is just go back one step if you

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:56.890 
history is just go back one step if you
just<00:02:55.460> have<00:02:55.670> it<00:02:55.820> everything<00:02:56.090> selected<00:02:56.420> the<00:02:56.780> way

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:56.900
