00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:31.240
 another round another fighting game 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:34.060
 this, however, you already know we are talking about 

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:35.620
 in fact of injustice box among us title 

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:37.300
 rather appreciated by critics e 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:38.559
 public also by virtue of its roster 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:41.200
 composed of the unforgettable 

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:42.340
 protagonists of the world of yes 

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.960
 the fact of being able to smash the face 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:45.610
 But superman is not the only one 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:47.110
 attractive feature of the title 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:49.059
 after all developed by netherrealm 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:50.800
 experienced team who managed to 

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:52.750
 carve out an important niche among the 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:54.250
 fighting game makers proposing a 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:55.900
 clearly combat system 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:57.880
 different from those seen in fighting 

00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:00.220
 game thumbs but still worthy of praise 

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:02.200
 since in the newsroom there is 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:03.730
 arrived at the last edition of the game there 

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:05.710
 seems like a good time to brush up 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:07.119
 the pad and see what differences there are 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:10.960
 among the next gen version 

00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:15.640
 and that current jen is revealed as cms item 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:17.710
 in the break we first do one 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:19.990
 short introduction to bring everyone back in 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:21.850
 roadway the history of injustice yes 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:23.530
 remakes the universe of yes but exploits 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:25.149
 the expedient of parallel reality for 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:27.100
 allow developers to do a 

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:29.289
 little what they want with the characters and 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:30.100
 the situations that are strictly involved 

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:32.560
 of a fighting game 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:34.899
 ergo there is no lack of narrative forcing 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:36.490
 but in style nateri to the story 

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:37.959
 mode and much more elaborate and long-lived than 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:39.580
 usual 

00:01:37.959 --> 00:01:41.530
 here lies the primary force of the 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:43.690
 beat of the US house i 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:45.550
 content while most of the titles 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:47.890
 of this kind tend to offer few 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:49.929
 mode and options the games in the three iamm 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:52.090
 they are full of missions and tests 

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:53.590
 unlockable and built around one 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:55.899
 campaign with lots of videos of 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:57.700
 intermezzo and special fights of 

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:59.170
 usually processed by conditions 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:01.360
 specifications or proof of ability from 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:03.970
 complete from this point of view in 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:06.009
 justice is unattainable achieved only 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:08.229
 from the last mortal kombat work of the 

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:10.539
 same team but the same cannot be said 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:11.470
 of his combat system which is not lacking 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:13.060
 users 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:15.130
 it is a more than good system 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:16.780
 be clear but it carries some 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:18.520
 magagne da mortal kombat 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:20.410
 first on all a certain prevalence 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:22.540
 of jogging due to bullets that 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:24.820
 they do not meet and are too much 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:27.010
 spreadable injustice at the beginning la 

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:28.840
 situation was intolerable and the network 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:31.060
 it was populated with superman and deathstroke 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:32.770
 Spaniards who made every battle a 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:34.180
 nothing short of frustrating 

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:36.220
 even the final of the injustice era 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:37.360
 was won by a superman with the trend 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:38.680
 to abuse lasers 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:40.660
 which has not gone down to many 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:41.530
 longtime enthusiasts later 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:43.600
 several patches 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:45.970
 the problem was at least partially 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:48.010
 resized jogging is easier 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:50.110
 to clean and many characters have been 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:52.240
 reintroduced suit list properly 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:53.800
 they still hit the mark but at least yes 

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:55.959
 can go online without having to sclerate 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:58.600
 automatically at each meeting with one 

00:02:55.959 --> 00:03:00.670
 zohner the ultimate x ps4 version 

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:02.620
 obviously it keeps every touch and super 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:04.600
 warriors resulting more enjoyable for 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:06.190
 who loves the competitive but otherwise is 

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:07.750
 all unchanged 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:09.640
 the system of combinations is always the 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:11.380
 target combo system must be of 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:12.580
 shots must be introduced immediately and not 

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:15.010
 needs to respect details 

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:16.720
 timing the emphasis on juggling is 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:18.640
 always very high and have been 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:20.560
 also kept the interactive rings with 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:22.239
 various elements that can be used to obtain 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:23.769
 an advantage over the opponent and that 

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:26.500
 are exploited in different ways a 

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:27.820
 depending on the chosen hero does not present 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:29.650
 in short, the fineness of the titles more 

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:30.850
 technicians and could turn up their noses 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:32.620
 to those who have passed youth on 

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:34.810
 classic of snk and capcom 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:36.640
 however it is a more structure 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:37.500
 accessible of the average is calculated ha 

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:39.180
 worthily 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:41.160
 I can also entertain players 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:43.140
 experts si signora nolÃ© its deficiencies 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:45.660
 there are therefore reasons to take 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:48.240
 the ps 4 version is surprisingly 

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:49.740
 they are not just a few because of it 

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:51.540
 minus the next gen version of the game 

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:52.650
 contains over 60 star missions 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:54.830
 additional and all characters 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:57.360
 downloadable introduced later 

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:59.160
 bearzot martian manhunter zatanna 

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:01.050
 then scorpion and lobe will be 

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:03.240
 available in the game with their respective 

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:05.040
 dedicated missions and a plethora of 

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:06.810
 extra costumes all to wear 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:08.820
 from a technical point of view 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:09.720
 however the innovations are almost 

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:11.910
 inexistent 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:13.680
 the title is more defined but at the level of 

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:15.540
 polygonal modeling we do not have 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:17.370
 sincerely noticed any progress 

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:19.230
 in improvement and animations e 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:22.940
 textures are nothing short of marginal 

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:22.940
 something more could have been done 

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:36.640
 is here 

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:36.640
