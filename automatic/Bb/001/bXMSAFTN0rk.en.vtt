00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:08.750
 this is formula 1 2013 good you have already 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:12.330
 heard the narrator welcome to formula1 

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:13.889
 2013 was recording the beginning of the 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.959
 trajectory mode where they teach you the 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:18.150
 basic things but it seemed so bland and 

00:00:15.959 --> 00:00:19.980
 bored that we're going to go directly to 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.500
 second day of tests where we can already 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.689
 from what I see driving freely about 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.890
 dry and over wet so this is what 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:27.240
 first thing we're going to do because the 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.619
 first tests are to accelerate and 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.210
 brake frankly I do not know what you're going to 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.340
 learn with that but good for 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.930
 people who have absolutely no idea 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.059
 of formula one maybe he does learn something 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.610
 but shortly you have certain notions 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:40.350
 I do not know why they make you do certain 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.539
 tests the truth but hey let's 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.000
 start as I say what would be the 

00:00:42.539 --> 00:00:46.530
 first serious driving test 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.750
 Freely dry in the yas circuit 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:52.680
 marine let's see how it behaves 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.940
 the game this fourth version of the saga 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.449
 of code masters that began in the year 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:59.360
 2010 and that frankly good is not 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:02.390
 I could call simulator 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:04.420
 I do not even know if he tries but 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:06.890
 good can be entertaining really 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:09.080
 Remember that you can return to since 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:11.330
 you just have to select return to 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:14.530
 box from the pause menu or enter 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:14.530
 directly in the video 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:24.829
 well we are already free to see if 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:26.390
 we went out of this amazing box 

00:01:24.829 --> 00:01:29.240
 output of the marine day circuit that is 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:31.069
 crazy and these are my first 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:34.579
 laps or rather my first round 

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:36.109
 of brake 2013 is put in the maximum 

00:01:34.579 --> 00:01:39.310
 difficulty without aid and others we will go 

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:39.310
 calmly at first logically 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:46.190
 and good as always is available in 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:47.630
 pc on playstation3 and xbox 360 this is the 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:49.930
 PC version you can watch the video of 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:51.790
 1080p also 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:53.230
 and well graphically I see that it has not 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:54.820
 changed a lot really is not it either 

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:57.130
 you can ask for more 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:59.170
 it is well done to spare and to see 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:01.500
 level of control if there is some kind of 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:01.500
 improvement 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:06.190
 I repeat that we are going to see calmly in this 

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:06.190
 first round 

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:13.340
 let's give a little 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.870
 and the drs there is open 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:38.359
 well frankly the first shot of 

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:40.480
 Contact then it does not tell me much or good 

00:02:38.359 --> 00:02:40.480
 not bad 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:48.800
 I love this final section of the 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:49.760
 circuit of them marine the truth is 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:52.989
 I think it's a pretty circuit 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:52.989
 original pretty curious 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:57.130
 a lot of people do not like it enough 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.750
 reluctant to accept new circuits 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:00.580
 but to me personally marine stars 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:02.710
 I like it a lot especially as I say 

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:05.880
 last part to confusing the entrance to 

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:07.870
 e boxes it seems that it will make you eat always 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:10.650
 you want to go through the circuit it seems that 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:10.650
 you will see yourself without wanting 

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:19.770
 let's give it a little sugar cane if 

00:03:17.969 --> 00:03:21.780
 can be 

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:23.730
 neither expect miracles that is my 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:26.900
 first round on a circuit that 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:26.900
 does not dominate much 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:35.810
 and so we're going 

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:42.290
 we 're almost going that cost us dearly 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:42.290
 a little more 

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:49.150
 is activated manually as always 

00:04:53.969 --> 00:04:58.709
 well frankly the first shot of 

00:04:56.429 --> 00:05:00.149
 Contact it leaves me cold is 

00:04:58.709 --> 00:05:01.529
 more of the same does not seem to have 

00:05:00.149 --> 00:05:02.879
 any kind of improvement on the issue of 

00:05:01.529 --> 00:05:05.519
 simulation of doing it a little more 

00:05:02.879 --> 00:05:06.869
 realistic does not seem does not seem that 

00:05:05.519 --> 00:05:09.419
 way cars behave very 

00:05:06.869 --> 00:05:10.649
 different from what it was 1 2012 ago but 

00:05:09.419 --> 00:05:12.739
 well I repeat that they are on a first 

00:05:10.649 --> 00:05:12.739
 Print 

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:23.810
 again I like to go out there twice 

00:05:21.449 --> 00:05:23.810
 followed already 

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:35.970
 we are going to finish this round to close 

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:37.650
 this first short video that frankly 

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:40.280
 I will not get any kind of impression 

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:40.280
 it seems to me 

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:47.220
 very long gone there 

00:06:37.639 --> 00:06:41.419
 Well that action forgiveness I talked a lot 

00:06:39.919 --> 00:06:43.699
 but I to the car game I have to 

00:06:41.419 --> 00:06:45.289
 play quiet because if I do not lose a 

00:06:43.699 --> 00:06:46.460
 lot of effectiveness good as all the 

00:06:45.289 --> 00:06:48.409
 world is normal these games require 

00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:51.050
 even if it's not really a simulator 

00:06:48.409 --> 00:06:52.219
 let's say strong is not very realistic then 

00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:54.680
 these games require a lot 

00:06:52.219 --> 00:06:57.550
 much more concentration I think that 

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:57.550
 any other gender 

00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:04.540
 and as I say we leave here this first 

00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:06.880
 video where we have seen little good but 

00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:09.300
 my first again that curve is 

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:11.490
 costing a lot 

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:14.490
 as I say did not draw any conclusion 

00:07:11.490 --> 00:07:16.259
 So it seems too similar to 2012 

00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:18.449
 that if it's a formula game one does not 

00:07:16.259 --> 00:07:20.639
 It may be very different but I do not see that 

00:07:18.449 --> 00:07:22.560
 there are many changes regarding the control 

00:07:20.639 --> 00:07:24.599
 the truth because it is clear that this does not 

00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:25.740
 it's a good simulator it's not, it's not 

00:07:24.599 --> 00:07:27.330
 it can be fun can be 

00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:29.370
 visually realistic but that does not want 

00:07:27.330 --> 00:07:31.710
 say that it is a good simulator or 

00:07:29.370 --> 00:07:32.970
 far but well let's give it a 

00:07:31.710 --> 00:07:34.590
 opportunity to line version people 

00:07:32.970 --> 00:07:37.620
 play at least without aids that is the 

00:07:34.590 --> 00:07:38.729
 grace at least I think I believe to see if 

00:07:37.620 --> 00:07:41.190
 we can make ourselves be careers 

00:07:38.729 --> 00:07:43.319
 minimally long I talk about 11 15 20 

00:07:41.190 --> 00:07:45.389
 turns that are about a half hour a bit 

00:07:43.319 --> 00:07:47.430
 least to do something that is serious 

00:07:45.389 --> 00:07:50.610
 and be able to try to enjoy it in a 

00:07:47.430 --> 00:07:52.199
 minimally realistic 

00:07:50.610 --> 00:07:54.379
 well more let the video I'm 

00:07:52.199 --> 00:07:56.069
 talking and I'm completely lost 

00:07:54.379 --> 00:07:58.139
 so we 'll see you in the next 

00:07:56.069 --> 00:08:00.270
 video where we will start to show more 

00:07:58.139 --> 00:08:02.039
 game things more circuits maybe the 

00:08:00.270 --> 00:08:04.650
 rain any race online let's see 

00:08:02.039 --> 00:08:08.120
 how everything is going so we'll see each other 

00:08:04.650 --> 00:08:08.120
 Brief then goodbye
