in the world so I think there's an extra
edge<00:00:30.779> that<00:00:31.169> attached<00:00:31.680> to<00:00:32.009> the<00:00:32.099> preparation

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:34.520 
edge that attached to the preparation
it's<00:00:33.480> not<00:00:33.600> been<00:00:33.720> great<00:00:33.930> memories<00:00:34.230> I<00:00:34.260> have<00:00:34.410> to

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
it's not been great memories I have to

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.260 
it's not been great memories I have to
say<00:00:34.680> but<00:00:34.739> then<00:00:35.010> not<00:00:35.250> many<00:00:35.430> teams<00:00:35.730> that<00:00:36.000> lots<00:00:36.180> of

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
say but then not many teams that lots of

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:37.850 
say but then not many teams that lots of
religion<00:00:36.600> up<00:00:36.690> great<00:00:36.900> memories<00:00:37.230> difficult
