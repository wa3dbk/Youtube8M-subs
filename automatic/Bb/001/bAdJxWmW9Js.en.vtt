why I prefer these over some of the

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:43.930 
why I prefer these over some of the
other<00:01:42.440> you<00:01:42.860> know<00:01:42.890> fire-starting<00:01:43.310> methods<00:01:43.820> is

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:43.940 
other you know fire-starting methods is

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:49.590 
other you know fire-starting methods is
i<00:01:44.150> can<00:01:44.840> easily<00:01:46.030> tear<00:01:47.030> one<00:01:47.210> of<00:01:47.300> these<00:01:47.420> apart<00:01:48.550> and

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:49.600 
i can easily tear one of these apart and

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:51.910 
i can easily tear one of these apart and
set<00:01:50.600> it<00:01:50.690> up<00:01:50.780> so<00:01:50.960> that<00:01:50.990> it'll<00:01:51.260> take<00:01:51.440> a<00:01:51.470> spark

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:51.920 
set it up so that it'll take a spark

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:53.410 
set it up so that it'll take a spark
some<00:01:52.580> of<00:01:52.670> the<00:01:52.730> other<00:01:52.850> products<00:01:53.210> that<00:01:53.270> I've

and stuff that are not really good for

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:04.450 
and stuff that are not really good for
you<00:02:02.060> soaked<00:02:02.360> into<00:02:02.540> them<00:02:03.070> these<00:02:04.070> are<00:02:04.220> just<00:02:04.280> a

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:04.460 
you soaked into them these are just a

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:05.710 
you soaked into them these are just a
little<00:02:04.580> bit<00:02:04.760> easier<00:02:04.850> to<00:02:05.000> tear<00:02:05.240> apart<00:02:05.300> and

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:05.720 
little bit easier to tear apart and

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:07.780 
little bit easier to tear apart and
throw<00:02:06.230> a<00:02:06.260> spark<00:02:06.620> to<00:02:06.650> another<00:02:07.490> thing<00:02:07.670> you're

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:07.790 
throw a spark to another thing you're

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:09.699 
throw a spark to another thing you're
going<00:02:07.880> to<00:02:07.940> need<00:02:08.090> is<00:02:08.300> I'm<00:02:09.259> just<00:02:09.379> using<00:02:09.590> a

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:09.709 
going to need is I'm just using a

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:11.260 
going to need is I'm just using a
pharisee<00:02:10.099> mehran<00:02:10.340> to<00:02:10.459> do<00:02:10.550> this<00:02:10.700> obviously<00:02:11.209> if

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:11.270 
pharisee mehran to do this obviously if

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:12.819 
pharisee mehran to do this obviously if
you<00:02:11.330> had<00:02:11.420> a<00:02:11.450> lighter<00:02:11.720> this<00:02:12.379> would<00:02:12.530> be<00:02:12.590> a<00:02:12.620> lot

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:12.829 
you had a lighter this would be a lot

00:02:12.829 --> 00:02:16.630 
you had a lighter this would be a lot
easier<00:02:12.859> and<00:02:13.489> i<00:02:14.000> always<00:02:14.689> carry<00:02:15.079> that<00:02:15.409> i<00:02:15.890> always

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 
easier and i always carry that i always

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:18.490 
easier and i always carry that i always
always<00:02:17.180> always<00:02:17.599> have<00:02:17.959> a<00:02:17.989> lighter

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500 
always always have a lighter

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:21.010 
always always have a lighter
me<00:02:18.710> but<00:02:19.010> I<00:02:19.040> always<00:02:19.250> also<00:02:19.880> have<00:02:20.150> a<00:02:20.510> Pharisee

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:21.020 
me but I always also have a Pharisee

me but I always also have a Pharisee
mourad<00:02:21.290> and<00:02:21.410> the<00:02:21.470> reason<00:02:21.710> why<00:02:21.830> is<00:02:21.860> because

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040 
mourad and the reason why is because

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:23.470 
mourad and the reason why is because
lighters<00:02:22.580> get<00:02:22.760> wet<00:02:22.970> and<00:02:23.120> then<00:02:23.210> they<00:02:23.300> don't

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:23.480 
lighters get wet and then they don't

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.960 
lighters get wet and then they don't
work<00:02:23.630> these<00:02:24.410> you<00:02:24.830> can<00:02:24.950> throw<00:02:25.100> in<00:02:25.190> a<00:02:25.250> river<00:02:25.460> pull

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:25.970 
work these you can throw in a river pull

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:27.070 
work these you can throw in a river pull
them<00:02:26.090> back<00:02:26.210> out<00:02:26.360> on<00:02:26.480> the<00:02:26.510> work<00:02:26.720> just<00:02:26.930> fine

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:27.080 
them back out on the work just fine

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:28.330 
them back out on the work just fine
you're<00:02:27.590> going<00:02:27.770> to<00:02:27.830> see<00:02:27.950> me<00:02:28.070> do<00:02:28.190> this
