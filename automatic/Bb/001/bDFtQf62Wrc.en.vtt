00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:05.189
 Hello everyone and welcome on my channel

00:00:05.189 --> 00:00:11.850

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:15.300
 I have it here and I bought it 

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:18.210
 shredded boned and skinless pardon 

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:22.230
 it's pretty much a raisin almost two pounds 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:25.650
 and I do it with garlic and onion salt and 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:27.390
 AlavÃ©s -6 and this has to be cold or 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.550
 at room temperature true so that 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.460
 know rich with the rest that we are going to 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.930
 put here I have two tomatoes this one does not 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.360
 I know if you can see that it's a little bit 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.040
 green, but I like the taste of 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.380
 that the one of the tomato like that but you what 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:43.500
 you can put mature if you like I have a 

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:47.520
 little onion a bell chili or 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:50.700
 chile morrÃ³n unscientific a media 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:55.200
 these half carrots and in the 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:58.430
 as it is said as I did with him at 

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:58.430
 potatoes with this one 

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:03.520
 and here I have two chilies closed for 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:07.000
 that it stings and a little cilantro that nothing 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:10.270
 the more it takes off it does not disappear with 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:13.410
 the hands I want it can not sting and what 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:13.410
 let's add everything here 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:22.630
 everything we are going to add and here I have 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:25.270
 lettuce and cabbage mix I have more or 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:27.970
 minus one cup of cabbage and on average 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:30.250
 of lettuce but that is already to the taste of 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:32.950
 each one and then I'm going to put it 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:35.470
 be washed and disinfected and I'll go 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:39.060
 to put a little nothing left over this 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:39.060
 but that's what I'm going to do for what 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:46.600
 so that no 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:49.020
 I did not pass cabbage and now we are going to 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:49.020
 stir 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:54.620
 this is delicious this is special 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:56.670
 for Lent to make some 

00:01:54.620 --> 00:02:01.700
 touched 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.700
 I think that with that with that lettuce 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:09.759
 and so with that, nothing else, I'm going to put you 

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:11.739
 a little black pepper 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:13.390
 and this is indispensable they have to 

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:16.319
 put it on because it is also something that 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:16.319
 It gives a delicious taste 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:21.760
 like those who do not want to put cabbage 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:23.860
 with desire only lettuce now yes that 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:25.990
 It is the bust of everyone and if you 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:27.580
 they want to put water but bell chili 

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:30.310
 it's also at our age they want the 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:31.700
 color they want I just give them 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:38.210
 an idea 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:41.200
 this is already there and as it is that I see it 

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:44.670
 how come I do spanish 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.670
 I prepare it rather well said 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:48.560
 ah 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:53.069
 you can not stop if you like with a 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:55.530
 dressing 

00:02:53.069 --> 00:03:00.300
 grabbed my my toast 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:02.870
 I put it in a dish I obviously put it 

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:02.870
 salad 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:08.939
 You can also change lemon to top 

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:11.969
 to your toast if you like everything so already 

00:03:08.939 --> 00:03:15.470
 It's a matter of taste and I put a 

00:03:11.969 --> 00:03:18.020
 little sauce 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:20.930
 and it is also the taste of each and 

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:23.030
 this with very quick toast but 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:24.230
 very rich I hope you like it and if you are 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:26.930
 spicy already with him 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:28.640
 with the habanero it can be weird that's 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:31.010
 if not they want it more spicy 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:33.200
 do not put more sauce and well then 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:35.210
 until next time I hope you like it and 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:36.950
 until the next video and do it for 

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:39.770
