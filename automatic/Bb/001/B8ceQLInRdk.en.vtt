00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:06.960
 today we will make very tasty cakes 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:09.420
 above all simple and of sure effect 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.250
 are the kisses of a lady, but I am a 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.809
 different from the normal ones because they are 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.700
 made with macaroons and so on 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:15.719
 mascarpone cheese 

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:17.900
 let's see what the ingredients are 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:17.900
 serve 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:26.039
 I bought a 200g pack of 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:30.420
 macaroons the normal ones 150 grams of 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:32.489
 fresh mascarpone 150 grams are used for 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:35.489
 this amount of amaretti ie one 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:37.350
 confection and chocolate tails 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.390
 which however can be varied with 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.520
 other little things like chocolate 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.230
 white with other forms the one according to 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.340
 Your liking there is who makes you that there 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.620
 also put the cost of things of 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.059
 pistachios chocolate and that goes 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.100
 very well later it became popular 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:52.110
 of the people who eat but at 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:55.559
 mascarpone 150 grams of mascarpone 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:57.390
 fresh as I repeat I added a bio 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:59.910
 two spoonfuls of icing sugar 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.949
 because to give him a little more sweetness 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.899
 Now let's see what happens 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:07.560
 I repeat, it's very simple 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:12.090
 take our macaroon 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:16.020
 we put mascarpone on the base 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.020
 let 's take the other but slow 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:29.299
 now we do it for 3 1 a between maretti 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:29.299
 let's move on to the final phase of the cadets 

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:36.990
 you really have to make the 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:38.970
 mascarpone over the remarks because 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:44.340
 then later we have to move on 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:47.789
 so-called chocolate is one thing 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:49.920
 the very short time is very simple and the 

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:51.450
 result of guarantee and very tasty 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.369
 then look now I do it 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.280
 contract after will continue the work 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:56.940
 Meanwhile, did he figure to go with you 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:58.979
 important that I excluded a little bit 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:01.350
 of the boot out because so 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:04.229
 let's pass then these here are ours 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:07.380
 peace of life but we pass them we do 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:11.039
 roll in the chocolate cans 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:12.790
 see uniformly and enjoyed yes 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:15.640
 stick to mascarpone 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:17.140
 and there I love you so we do for everyone 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:20.819
 kisses until we finish 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:20.819
 the concession 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:33.520
 our biscuits are ready i 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:35.900
 Lady's kisses are finished 

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:38.569
 obviously now they will have to stay for 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:41.360
 at least 4 hours in the refrigerator so that 

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:44.090
 the little boy who is very tough now yes 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:46.730
 soften with mascarpone io 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:48.530
 normally I do them the night before for 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:50.750
 to be able to eat them at noon of the 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:52.640
 next day it is clear that you will have to 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:54.200
 remove from the fridge at least an hour before 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:56.300
 to eat them 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:58.489
 and I guarantee that if you are now so 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:00.890
 and it seemed hard when you put yourself in 

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:04.130
 mouth will be an explosion of taste that 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:06.140
 they will be really delicious, very soft 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:08.150
 another consideration that I make them 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:10.459
 what can I do is that you will also do a 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:13.549
 great if you want to present them with 

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:15.830
 pastry biscuit maps if there 

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:18.200
 put each of them in a basin from 

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:21.769
 pastry will make an exaggerated impression 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:25.940
 so it is a simple and very tasty dessert 

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:28.160
 and you can do it in just a few minutes e 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:29.060
 also this time from di franci one is 

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:31.810
