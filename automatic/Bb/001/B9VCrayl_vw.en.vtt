00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.180
 we've got people to my first video of let's play of food 

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:05.710
 Lover back 

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:09.900
 I do not have games that plot North Fork conspiracy procedure needs 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:10.599
 it was something 

00:00:10.599 --> 00:00:11.699
 so would 

00:00:11.699 --> 00:00:13.659
 that's just how it is 

00:00:13.659 --> 00:00:15.200
 I'll watch later that became 

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:16.659
 Change view 

00:00:16.659 --> 00:00:19.509
 for example this is a game 

00:00:19.509 --> 00:00:22.759
 we do not feel obliged to the country but 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:26.710
 Asad IRR then 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:28.029
 if I am constantly 

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:32.469
 yes I think nobody thinks that none in the morning 

00:00:32.469 --> 00:00:36.990
 to wake up and in the middle of a war are worlds between two secret societies 

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:38.830
 so not me 

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:40.630
 but here will 

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:44.829
 on the one hand the Templars better known as Asian Glory Industries 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.010
 makes every folder suitable 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:50.920
 in politics 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:52.540
 technology 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:55.750
 They do not give up until every one of us serves them 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.130
 The assassins fight against them 

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:03.130
 a group that wants to protect people's free will 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:07.010
 to grow properly through my blood 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:09.600
 A few weeks ago, the Templars found me 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.190
 they did not kidnap 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:14.200
 when she turned on one of her machines and let me work 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:15.660
 it started then 

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:18.060
 Years, I spent a lot of time 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.390
 experienced the memories of my ancestors 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:23.430
 discovered all life he saves Reiner Bieck 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.210
 I experienced the memory of life as a retiree 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.560
 he was at the cost 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.500
 The Templars wanted to find the site a so-called secondary obligation 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.500
 an antique queried the film image can influence 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:41.650
 they thought they had what they were looking for 

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:44.650
 and decided to liquidate me 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:52.800
 As a very dark statement, she has to recognize herself as an assassin and airports 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:57.170
 I hope that would be the end of my bad luck 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:59.760
 but it was only the beginning 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:02.760
 I got off to a noname again 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.520
 now done the memories of 50 euros the gates shone for it 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:11.199
 my ancestors from the renaissance in search of answers 

00:02:11.789 --> 00:02:15.339
 By winning the effect, I will now really become one that fits the goal 

00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:19.369
 and that's good because the Templars want us all enslaved 

00:02:20.749 --> 00:02:22.369
 they found and 

00:02:22.369 --> 00:02:25.569
 They stormed our understanding of the Indians search for shelter 

00:02:29.419 --> 00:02:32.419
 sometimes my name is that's my story 

00:02:33.839 --> 00:02:36.839
 and let's go 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:41.050
 mostly from Ubisoft i hope i get locked 10 

00:02:42.669 --> 00:02:45.669
 and it starts with the long time she is wearing 

00:02:49.999 --> 00:02:52.999
 s 

00:03:03.429 --> 00:03:05.229
 who is not the case here 

00:03:05.229 --> 00:03:08.229
 the goals for Chelsea 

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:12.309
 and it is allowed 

00:03:12.309 --> 00:03:15.309
 behave like this 

00:03:17.619 --> 00:03:20.619
 and contemplative thoughts 

00:03:40.689 --> 00:03:42.979
 it hits Jan Becker what's going on 

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:44.739
 I have to do the same 

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:47.739
 I'm serious 

00:03:55.829 --> 00:03:58.829
 What ever 

00:03:59.699 --> 00:04:02.789
 8 of the noise stick the sand 

00:04:02.789 --> 00:04:05.789
 ugly 

00:04:10.499 --> 00:04:13.499
 Vienna 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:20.859
 now firmly 

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:22.460
 I do not understand him 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:23.900
 waiting so far 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:26.900
 I have so many questions 

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:40.360
 although I'm sure 

00:04:41.039 --> 00:04:43.689
 Obama had pushed that way 

00:04:43.689 --> 00:04:46.210
 Euro the disillusionment 

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:49.210
 a big bite 

00:04:51.349 --> 00:04:54.349
 a worker died that gave me back then 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:58.180
 first could 

00:05:01.639 --> 00:05:04.639
 that punishes 

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:35.580
 Munich 

00:05:39.199 --> 00:05:42.199
 Tippelt 

00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:57.749
 it would be better 

00:05:57.749 --> 00:05:59.809
 as every other person 

00:05:59.809 --> 00:06:01.639
 Brown could 

00:06:01.639 --> 00:06:02.720
 what can I say 

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:05.319
 we will send another guest 

00:06:05.319 --> 00:06:08.430
 i would say dr head up we have to face the world 

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:11.000
 a short
