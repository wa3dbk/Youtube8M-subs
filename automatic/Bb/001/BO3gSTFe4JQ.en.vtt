welcome to this first crossover machine

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.580 
welcome to this first crossover machine
training<00:00:37.980> video<00:00:38.390> so<00:00:39.390> in<00:00:39.690> this<00:00:40.019> first<00:00:40.079> video

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
training video so in this first video

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.130 
training video so in this first video
I'm<00:00:41.070> going<00:00:41.399> to<00:00:41.460> talk<00:00:41.519> about<00:00:41.820> the<00:00:42.180> key<00:00:42.600> to<00:00:43.050> an

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
I'm going to talk about the key to an

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.579 
I'm going to talk about the key to an
effective<00:00:43.519> crossover<00:00:44.519> move<00:00:44.670> but<00:00:45.510> before<00:00:46.409> I<00:00:46.440> do

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:46.589 
effective crossover move but before I do

00:00:46.589 --> 00:00:49.460 
effective crossover move but before I do
that<00:00:46.800> I<00:00:47.220> want<00:00:47.550> you<00:00:48.059> to<00:00:48.149> watch<00:00:48.449> this<00:00:48.780> video<00:00:49.079> and

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:49.470 
that I want you to watch this video and

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:52.520 
that I want you to watch this video and
try<00:00:50.280> to<00:00:50.339> figure<00:00:50.699> out<00:00:51.000> if<00:00:51.210> you<00:00:51.659> can<00:00:51.930> determine

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
try to figure out if you can determine

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.100 
try to figure out if you can determine
what<00:00:52.710> the<00:00:53.460> key<00:00:53.729> to<00:00:54.000> an<00:00:54.120> effective<00:00:54.180> crossover

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
what the key to an effective crossover

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.430 
what the key to an effective crossover
is<00:00:55.290> so<00:00:55.920> watch<00:00:56.550> this<00:00:56.850> video<00:00:57.120> and<00:00:57.510> try<00:00:58.110> to<00:00:58.140> figure

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
is so watch this video and try to figure

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.410 
is so watch this video and try to figure
out<00:00:58.649> what<00:00:58.890> all<00:00:59.100> these<00:00:59.430> different<00:00:59.729> processors

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
out what all these different processors

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.799 
out what all these different processors
have<00:01:00.809> in<00:01:01.559> common<00:01:02.190> so<00:01:02.760> do<00:01:03.059> that<00:01:03.179> right<00:01:03.390> now<00:01:03.449> and

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
have in common so do that right now and

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:35.820 
have in common so do that right now and
I'll<00:01:03.989> talk<00:01:04.170> to<00:01:04.229> you<00:01:04.440> in<00:01:04.500> about<00:01:04.800> two<00:01:05.129> minutes

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:35.830 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:03:26.039 

you

00:03:26.039 --> 00:03:26.049 

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:28.959 

alright<00:03:27.049> so<00:03:27.469> we're<00:03:27.680> you<00:03:27.829> able<00:03:27.980> to<00:03:28.249> figure<00:03:28.700> out

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:28.969 
alright so we're you able to figure out

00:03:28.969 --> 00:03:32.470 
alright so we're you able to figure out
what<00:03:29.299> all<00:03:29.510> these<00:03:29.889> crossovers<00:03:30.889> have<00:03:31.700> in<00:03:31.969> common

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:32.480 
what all these crossovers have in common

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:34.989 
what all these crossovers have in common
and<00:03:32.659> what<00:03:33.200> basically<00:03:33.349> the<00:03:34.189> key<00:03:34.609> to<00:03:34.909> an

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:34.999 
and what basically the key to an

00:03:34.999 --> 00:03:38.259 
and what basically the key to an
effective<00:03:35.090> frost<00:03:35.780> /<00:03:36.109> movies<00:03:36.579> well<00:03:37.579> if<00:03:37.849> you

00:03:38.259 --> 00:03:38.269 
effective frost / movies well if you

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:39.940 
effective frost / movies well if you
weren't<00:03:38.510> then<00:03:38.930> it's<00:03:39.079> fine<00:03:39.319> because<00:03:39.499> I'm<00:03:39.859> going

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:39.950 
weren't then it's fine because I'm going

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:42.069 
weren't then it's fine because I'm going
to<00:03:40.010> be<00:03:40.129> revealing<00:03:40.579> that<00:03:41.239> to<00:03:41.510> you<00:03:41.629> right<00:03:41.870> now

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:42.079 
to be revealing that to you right now

00:03:42.079 --> 00:03:45.429 
to be revealing that to you right now
but<00:03:42.920> before<00:03:43.219> I<00:03:43.459> do<00:03:43.609> that<00:03:43.819> let<00:03:44.269> us<00:03:44.989> examine

00:03:45.429 --> 00:03:45.439 
but before I do that let us examine

00:03:45.439 --> 00:03:48.910 
but before I do that let us examine
exactly<00:03:46.030> what<00:03:47.030> the<00:03:47.299> purpose<00:03:47.930> of<00:03:48.109> a<00:03:48.349> crossover

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:48.920 
exactly what the purpose of a crossover

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:51.729 
exactly what the purpose of a crossover
move<00:03:49.280> is<00:03:49.519> before<00:03:50.420> I<00:03:50.450> tell<00:03:50.719> you<00:03:50.780> the<00:03:51.079> key<00:03:51.379> to<00:03:51.409> an

00:03:51.729 --> 00:03:51.739 
move is before I tell you the key to an

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:53.800 
move is before I tell you the key to an
effective<00:03:51.799> for<00:03:52.370> us<00:03:52.430> over<00:03:52.790> you<00:03:53.299> first<00:03:53.599> have<00:03:53.780> to

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:53.810 
effective for us over you first have to

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:56.470 
effective for us over you first have to
understand<00:03:54.409> exactly<00:03:54.980> what<00:03:55.730> the<00:03:55.909> purpose<00:03:56.329> of

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:56.480 
understand exactly what the purpose of

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:59.259 
understand exactly what the purpose of
the<00:03:56.599> process<00:03:57.019> over<00:03:57.230> is<00:03:57.319> so<00:03:58.060> basically<00:03:59.060> when

00:03:59.259 --> 00:03:59.269 
the process over is so basically when

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:01.750 
the process over is so basically when
you're<00:03:59.389> performing<00:03:59.599> a<00:04:00.109> crossover<00:04:00.439> move<00:04:00.980> what

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:01.760 
you're performing a crossover move what

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:04.390 
you're performing a crossover move what
you're<00:04:01.939> basically<00:04:02.540> trying<00:04:02.840> to<00:04:03.109> do<00:04:03.439> is<00:04:03.739> make

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:04.400 
you're basically trying to do is make

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:05.740 
you're basically trying to do is make
your<00:04:04.579> defender<00:04:05.060> thing<00:04:05.299> that<00:04:05.449> you're<00:04:05.569> going<00:04:05.689> to

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:05.750 
your defender thing that you're going to

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:07.929 
your defender thing that you're going to
go<00:04:05.900> one<00:04:06.199> way<00:04:06.230> while<00:04:07.040> you<00:04:07.250> go<00:04:07.430> the<00:04:07.639> other<00:04:07.669> way

00:04:07.929 --> 00:04:07.939 
go one way while you go the other way

00:04:07.939 --> 00:04:10.300 
go one way while you go the other way
that's<00:04:08.569> basically<00:04:08.900> what<00:04:09.590> you're<00:04:09.739> doing<00:04:10.099> in

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:10.310 
that's basically what you're doing in

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:13.149 
that's basically what you're doing in
every<00:04:11.060> single<00:04:11.329> crossover<00:04:12.199> doesn't<00:04:12.889> matter<00:04:13.069> if

00:04:13.149 --> 00:04:13.159 
every single crossover doesn't matter if

00:04:13.159 --> 00:04:14.740 
every single crossover doesn't matter if
you're<00:04:13.219> performing<00:04:13.669> a<00:04:14.090> between-the-legs

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:14.750 
you're performing a between-the-legs

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:18.129 
you're performing a between-the-legs
crossover<00:04:15.340> behind<00:04:16.340> about<00:04:16.849> trois<00:04:17.150> over<00:04:17.539> they

00:04:18.129 --> 00:04:18.139 
crossover behind about trois over they

00:04:18.139 --> 00:04:20.830 
crossover behind about trois over they
all<00:04:18.380> have<00:04:18.739> the<00:04:18.949> same<00:04:19.160> purpose<00:04:19.759> you're<00:04:20.329> simply

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:20.840 
all have the same purpose you're simply

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:22.150 
all have the same purpose you're simply
trying<00:04:21.079> to<00:04:21.169> make<00:04:21.259> your<00:04:21.470> defender<00:04:21.919> think

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:22.160 
trying to make your defender think

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:24.010 
trying to make your defender think
you're<00:04:22.250> going<00:04:22.400> to<00:04:22.430> go<00:04:22.580> one<00:04:22.849> way<00:04:22.880> while<00:04:23.630> you<00:04:23.810> go

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:24.020 
you're going to go one way while you go

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:30.339 
you're going to go one way while you go
the<00:04:24.410> other<00:04:24.440> way

00:04:30.339 --> 00:04:30.349 

00:04:30.349 --> 00:04:34.549 

so<00:04:31.349> the<00:04:32.039> key<00:04:32.399> to<00:04:32.669> an<00:04:32.759> effective<00:04:33.139> crossover<00:04:34.139> is

00:04:34.549 --> 00:04:34.559 
so the key to an effective crossover is

00:04:34.559 --> 00:04:38.269 
so the key to an effective crossover is
that<00:04:35.129> fake<00:04:35.639> step<00:04:36.089> you<00:04:36.269> did<00:04:36.509> one<00:04:36.959> way<00:04:37.279> before

00:04:38.269 --> 00:04:38.279 
that fake step you did one way before

00:04:38.279 --> 00:04:41.329 
that fake step you did one way before
you<00:04:38.489> go<00:04:38.729> the<00:04:39.089> other<00:04:39.119> way<00:04:39.509> it's<00:04:40.229> all<00:04:40.649> about<00:04:40.679> that

00:04:41.329 --> 00:04:41.339 
you go the other way it's all about that

00:04:41.339 --> 00:04:44.179 
you go the other way it's all about that
fit<00:04:41.729> if<00:04:42.059> you<00:04:42.629> can<00:04:42.839> sell<00:04:43.319> the<00:04:43.559> fit<00:04:43.860> your

00:04:44.179 --> 00:04:44.189 
fit if you can sell the fit your

00:04:44.189 --> 00:04:46.639 
fit if you can sell the fit your
defender<00:04:44.819> then<00:04:45.449> you<00:04:45.599> will<00:04:45.719> be<00:04:45.959> able<00:04:46.049> to<00:04:46.199> easily

00:04:46.639 --> 00:04:46.649 
defender then you will be able to easily

00:04:46.649 --> 00:04:49.549 
defender then you will be able to easily
get<00:04:47.039> by<00:04:47.309> him<00:04:47.519> now<00:04:48.389> a<00:04:48.419> lot<00:04:48.809> of<00:04:48.839> players<00:04:49.199> thing

00:04:49.549 --> 00:04:49.559 
get by him now a lot of players thing

00:04:49.559 --> 00:04:51.829 
get by him now a lot of players thing
that<00:04:50.159> the<00:04:50.339> key<00:04:50.519> to<00:04:50.549> an<00:04:50.759> effective<00:04:50.849> crossover

00:04:51.829 --> 00:04:51.839 
that the key to an effective crossover

00:04:51.839 --> 00:04:54.379 
that the key to an effective crossover
is<00:04:52.110> to<00:04:52.289> perform<00:04:52.739> it<00:04:52.949> as<00:04:53.339> quickly<00:04:53.789> as<00:04:54.029> you<00:04:54.179> can

00:04:54.379 --> 00:04:54.389 
is to perform it as quickly as you can

00:04:54.389 --> 00:04:57.289 
is to perform it as quickly as you can
that's<00:04:54.629> really<00:04:55.199> not<00:04:55.439> about<00:04:55.679> it<00:04:56.069> the<00:04:56.669> key<00:04:56.969> to<00:04:56.999> an

00:04:57.289 --> 00:04:57.299 
that's really not about it the key to an

00:05:00.079 --> 00:05:00.089 
effective crossover is to sell the fake

00:05:00.089 --> 00:05:02.299 
effective crossover is to sell the fake
and<00:05:00.360> make<00:05:01.079> your<00:05:01.289> defender<00:05:01.769> thing<00:05:02.009> that<00:05:02.189> you're

00:05:02.299 --> 00:05:02.309 
and make your defender thing that you're

00:05:02.309 --> 00:05:04.399 
and make your defender thing that you're
going<00:05:02.339> to<00:05:02.519> go<00:05:02.639> one<00:05:02.909> way<00:05:03.119> and<00:05:03.360> then<00:05:03.929> at<00:05:04.079> the<00:05:04.110> last

00:05:04.399 --> 00:05:04.409 
going to go one way and then at the last

00:05:04.409 --> 00:05:06.289 
going to go one way and then at the last
minute<00:05:04.649> you<00:05:04.949> cross<00:05:05.279> over<00:05:05.549> and<00:05:05.729> go<00:05:06.089> the<00:05:06.269> other

minute you cross over and go the other
way<00:05:06.569> now<00:05:07.469> the<00:05:08.459> key<00:05:08.729> to<00:05:08.969> performing<00:05:09.629> this

00:05:09.739 --> 00:05:09.749 
way now the key to performing this

00:05:09.749 --> 00:05:13.969 
way now the key to performing this
properly<00:05:10.379> is<00:05:10.769> to<00:05:11.959> exaggerate<00:05:12.959> the<00:05:13.229> fake<00:05:13.559> step

00:05:13.969 --> 00:05:13.979 
properly is to exaggerate the fake step

00:05:13.979 --> 00:05:17.059 
properly is to exaggerate the fake step
and<00:05:14.279> make<00:05:14.909> it<00:05:15.089> almost<00:05:15.299> obvious<00:05:15.779> your<00:05:16.529> defender

00:05:17.059 --> 00:05:17.069 
and make it almost obvious your defender
