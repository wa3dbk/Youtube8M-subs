the shift button will move the entire
row<00:01:32.060> of<00:01:32.240> prongs<00:01:32.630> but<00:01:33.080> you'll<00:01:33.260> see<00:01:33.439> the<00:01:34.430> issue

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:35.590 
row of prongs but you'll see the issue

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:39.660 
row of prongs but you'll see the issue
at<00:01:36.590> the<00:01:36.770> moment<00:01:36.799> is<00:01:37.400> that<00:01:37.430> it's<00:01:38.030> not<00:01:38.659> moving

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:39.670 
at the moment is that it's not moving

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:42.100 
at the moment is that it's not moving
the<00:01:40.670> prong<00:01:40.939> at<00:01:41.119> either<00:01:41.330> end<00:01:41.659> of<00:01:41.780> the<00:01:41.900> line

the prong at either end of the line

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:44.310 
the prong at either end of the line
segment<00:01:42.650> so<00:01:42.799> at<00:01:43.009> the<00:01:43.130> start<00:01:43.400> and<00:01:43.580> the<00:01:43.670> end<00:01:43.729> of<00:01:43.970> a

segment so at the start and the end of a

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:46.420 
segment so at the start and the end of a
section<00:01:45.320> whether<00:01:45.500> that's<00:01:45.770> a<00:01:45.890> straight<00:01:46.159> line

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:46.430 
section whether that's a straight line

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:50.109 
section whether that's a straight line
or<00:01:46.670> whether<00:01:46.820> that's<00:01:47.060> a<00:01:47.210> curve<00:01:48.670> it<00:01:49.670> will<00:01:49.880> place

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:50.119 
or whether that's a curve it will place

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:54.280 
or whether that's a curve it will place
at<00:01:50.479> the<00:01:50.689> moment<00:01:51.049> I<00:01:51.610> prom<00:01:52.689> in<00:01:53.689> the<00:01:53.900> center<00:01:54.170> of

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:54.290 
at the moment I prom in the center of

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:56.980 
at the moment I prom in the center of
the<00:01:54.470> in<00:01:54.710> stone<00:01:55.100> so<00:01:55.340> I'll<00:01:56.329> just<00:01:56.570> quickly<00:01:56.659> show

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:56.990 
the in stone so I'll just quickly show

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:59.310 
the in stone so I'll just quickly show
you<00:01:57.020> a<00:01:57.140> way<00:01:57.380> to<00:01:57.439> solve<00:01:57.799> that<00:01:58.100> you<00:01:58.250> can<00:01:58.400> just

00:01:59.310 --> 00:01:59.320 
you a way to solve that you can just

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:03.249 
you a way to solve that you can just
grab<00:02:00.320> that<00:02:00.590> prong<00:02:00.890> and<00:02:01.100> move<00:02:01.460> it<00:02:01.640> through<00:02:02.259> the

00:02:03.249 --> 00:02:03.259 
grab that prong and move it through the

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:05.230 
grab that prong and move it through the
edge<00:02:03.409> of<00:02:03.590> that<00:02:03.710> stone<00:02:04.070> into<00:02:04.970> a<00:02:05.000> similar

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:05.240 
edge of that stone into a similar

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:08.229 
edge of that stone into a similar
position<00:02:05.720> as<00:02:05.810> the<00:02:05.930> other<00:02:05.960> prongs<00:02:06.380> and<00:02:07.060> you<00:02:08.060> can

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:08.239 
position as the other prongs and you can

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:14.040 
position as the other prongs and you can
then<00:02:08.390> come<00:02:08.569> across<00:02:08.660> to<00:02:09.170> the<00:02:09.259> other<00:02:09.380> end

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:14.050 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:22.210 

and<00:02:15.050> come<00:02:15.380> in<00:02:16.930> and<00:02:17.930> move<00:02:18.260> that<00:02:18.470> into<00:02:21.220> positions

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:22.220 
and come in and move that into positions

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:34.610 
and come in and move that into positions
so<00:02:23.209> it's<00:02:23.330> quite<00:02:23.870> easily<00:02:25.720> resolved

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.750 

now<00:02:35.620> just<00:02:35.830> to<00:02:35.920> show<00:02:35.980> you<00:02:36.190> that<00:02:36.220> with<00:02:36.460> a<00:02:36.520> few

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760 
now just to show you that with a few

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:42.570 
now just to show you that with a few
other<00:02:36.880> examples<00:02:39.840> let's<00:02:41.040> come<00:02:42.040> across<00:02:42.340> here

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:49.570 
and unhide the other gems here I'll just

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:54.750 
and unhide the other gems here I'll just
select<00:02:49.720> this<00:02:50.020> group<00:02:50.230> here<00:02:53.460> and<00:02:54.460> run<00:02:54.640> the

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:01.070 
click the checkmark so ok so it's what

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:05.170 
click the checkmark so ok so it's what
quite<00:04:01.340> easily<00:04:01.700> resolved<00:04:02.350> and<00:04:03.820> it<00:04:04.820> displays<00:04:05.060> a

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:09.130 
similar issue with a circle so let's I

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:12.520 
similar issue with a circle so let's I
select<00:04:10.130> all<00:04:10.280> the<00:04:10.430> gems<00:04:10.670> here<00:04:11.000> and<00:04:11.320> run<00:04:12.320> the

prongs inline once again the diameter is

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:23.500 
prongs inline once again the diameter is
going<00:04:19.760> to<00:04:19.850> be<00:04:20.000> 0.6<00:04:20.540> I<00:04:21.220> click<00:04:22.220> on<00:04:22.340> my<00:04:22.490> grid<00:04:22.760> to

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:23.510 
going to be 0.6 I click on my grid to

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:26.500 
going to be 0.6 I click on my grid to
affect<00:04:23.840> the<00:04:23.930> change<00:04:24.260> in<00:04:24.440> diameter<00:04:24.620> size<00:04:25.510> now

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:26.510 
affect the change in diameter size now

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:31.600 
affect the change in diameter size now
in<00:04:26.690> this<00:04:26.810> case<00:04:28.960> you<00:04:29.960> can<00:04:30.140> see<00:04:30.410> around<00:04:30.770> a<00:04:31.190> circle

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:31.610 
in this case you can see around a circle

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:34.800 
in this case you can see around a circle
there's<00:04:31.820> a<00:04:31.880> position<00:04:32.120> here<00:04:33.250> where<00:04:34.250> once<00:04:34.490> again

on the sphere to move the position when

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:58.060 
on the sphere to move the position when
I<00:04:54.590> let<00:04:54.800> go<00:04:54.830> it<00:04:55.040> will<00:04:55.400> affect<00:04:56.620> all<00:04:57.620> of<00:04:57.830> the<00:04:57.920> other

00:04:58.060 --> 00:04:58.070 
I let go it will affect all of the other

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:01.090 
I let go it will affect all of the other
prongs<00:04:58.400> except<00:04:59.150> the<00:04:59.240> start<00:04:59.480> and<00:04:59.600> end<00:04:59.810> point<00:05:00.100> so

prongs except the start and end point so

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:03.640 
prongs except the start and end point so
I<00:05:01.130> can<00:05:01.310> just<00:05:01.460> simply<00:05:01.760> grab<00:05:02.480> one<00:05:02.720> move<00:05:03.530> it

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:03.650 
I can just simply grab one move it

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:13.670 
I can just simply grab one move it
across<00:05:03.740> to<00:05:04.130> here

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:13.680 

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:16.640 

and<00:05:13.770> for<00:05:13.949> this<00:05:14.039> one<00:05:14.220> in<00:05:14.340> the<00:05:14.430> middle<00:05:15.380> I'll<00:05:16.380> show

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:16.650 
and for this one in the middle I'll show

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:20.480 
and for this one in the middle I'll show
you<00:05:16.740> how<00:05:16.860> to<00:05:16.919> resolve<00:05:17.310> that<00:05:17.370> one<00:05:19.340> because<00:05:20.340> if

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:20.490 
you how to resolve that one because if

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:23.180 
you how to resolve that one because if
we<00:05:20.610> come<00:05:20.789> in<00:05:20.910> here<00:05:21.150> and<00:05:21.590> move<00:05:22.590> it<00:05:22.770> we<00:05:22.889> can<00:05:23.039> move

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:23.190 
we come in here and move it we can move

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:28.999 
we come in here and move it we can move
it<00:05:23.340> to<00:05:23.490> a<00:05:23.520> new<00:05:23.729> position<00:05:26.720> we<00:05:27.720> can<00:05:27.870> move<00:05:28.740> it<00:05:28.889> out

00:05:28.999 --> 00:05:29.009 
it to a new position we can move it out

00:05:29.009 --> 00:05:30.200 
it to a new position we can move it out
of<00:05:29.039> the<00:05:29.160> way<00:05:29.340> but<00:05:29.639> we've<00:05:29.789> got<00:05:29.970> to<00:05:30.060> somehow

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:30.210 
of the way but we've got to somehow

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:32.060 
of the way but we've got to somehow
delete<00:05:30.780> it<00:05:30.930> later<00:05:30.960> on<00:05:31.289> because<00:05:31.680> because<00:05:31.949> we

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:32.070 
delete it later on because because we

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:33.320 
delete it later on because because we
don't<00:05:32.250> want<00:05:32.430> it<00:05:32.520> there<00:05:32.699> so<00:05:32.940> you<00:05:33.000> can<00:05:33.210> either

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:33.330 
don't want it there so you can either

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:35.150 
don't want it there so you can either
easier<00:05:34.050> thing<00:05:34.229> is<00:05:34.320> just<00:05:34.470> to<00:05:34.620> leave<00:05:34.770> it<00:05:34.800> in<00:05:35.009> its

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:35.160 
easier thing is just to leave it in its

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:36.170 
easier thing is just to leave it in its
original<00:05:35.370> position

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:36.180 
original position

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:42.520 
original position
and<00:05:36.389> we'll<00:05:37.020> delete<00:05:37.320> that<00:05:37.500> in<00:05:38.100> the<00:05:38.190> next<00:05:38.430> step

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:42.530 

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:45.140 

so<00:05:43.530> the<00:05:43.650> way<00:05:43.740> we<00:05:43.919> delete<00:05:44.220> that<00:05:44.400> particular

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:45.150 
so the way we delete that particular

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:48.040 
so the way we delete that particular
prong<00:05:45.600> is<00:05:46.020> we<00:05:46.830> select<00:05:47.160> the<00:05:47.280> group<00:05:47.490> of<00:05:47.639> prongs
