think that the financial crisis was was
an<00:00:20.760> ant<00:00:20.970> and<00:00:21.150> we<00:00:21.330> just<00:00:21.539> need<00:00:21.689> a<00:00:21.750> low<00:00:21.960> ants<00:00:22.949> water

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
an ant and we just need a low ants water

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:24.859 
an ant and we just need a low ants water
to<00:00:23.550> fix<00:00:23.789> this<00:00:23.939> thing<00:00:24.000> or<00:00:24.300> do<00:00:24.390> you<00:00:24.449> think<00:00:24.720> that

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
to fix this thing or do you think that

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:27.650 
to fix this thing or do you think that
we<00:00:24.990> need<00:00:25.019> to<00:00:25.619> restructure<00:00:26.550> how<00:00:27.029> we<00:00:27.090> regulate

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
we need to restructure how we regulate

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.109 
we need to restructure how we regulate
the<00:00:28.349> financial<00:00:28.529> system<00:00:29.070> so<00:00:29.429> you<00:00:29.490> are<00:00:29.760> on<00:00:29.789> the

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
the financial system so you are on the

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:31.820 
the financial system so you are on the
hook<00:00:30.269> again<00:00:30.449> and<00:00:31.080> we<00:00:31.320> don't<00:00:31.500> have<00:00:31.650> this<00:00:31.769> kind

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
hook again and we don't have this kind

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.000 
hook again and we don't have this kind
of<00:00:32.099> crisis<00:00:32.520> again<00:00:33.440> before<00:00:34.440> i<00:00:34.649> was<00:00:34.950> even

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
of crisis again before i was even

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.360 
of crisis again before i was even
inaugurated<00:00:36.350> there<00:00:37.350> were<00:00:37.469> leaders<00:00:38.040> on<00:00:38.250> the

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
inaugurated there were leaders on the

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:39.619 
inaugurated there were leaders on the
other<00:00:38.489> side<00:00:38.730> of<00:00:38.760> the<00:00:38.910> aisle<00:00:39.030> who<00:00:39.270> got<00:00:39.450> together

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
other side of the aisle who got together

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.869 
other side of the aisle who got together
and<00:00:39.899> they<00:00:39.960> made<00:00:40.170> the<00:00:40.290> calculation<00:00:40.950> that<00:00:41.129> if

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
and they made the calculation that if

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:46.490 
and they made the calculation that if
obama<00:00:42.270> fails<00:00:42.660> then<00:00:43.649> we<00:00:43.860> win<00:00:45.200> right<00:00:46.200> that<00:00:46.379> was

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
obama fails then we win right that was

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.190 
obama fails then we win right that was
the<00:00:46.559> basic<00:00:46.860> theory<00:00:47.329> they<00:00:48.329> figured<00:00:48.719> if<00:00:48.870> we<00:00:49.020> just

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
the basic theory they figured if we just

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.069 
the basic theory they figured if we just
keep<00:00:49.379> on<00:00:49.559> saying<00:00:49.860> no<00:00:50.129> to<00:00:50.190> everything<00:00:50.370> and

00:00:51.069 --> 00:00:51.079 
keep on saying no to everything and

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:55.970 
keep on saying no to everything and
nothing<00:00:52.079> gets<00:00:52.289> done<00:00:52.879> then<00:00:54.530> somehow<00:00:55.530> people

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
nothing gets done then somehow people

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.740 
nothing gets done then somehow people
forget<00:00:56.370> who<00:00:56.730> got<00:00:56.910> us<00:00:57.059> into<00:00:57.210> this<00:00:57.360> mess<00:00:57.420> in<00:00:57.600> the

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
forget who got us into this mess in the

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.750 
forget who got us into this mess in the
first<00:00:57.840> place<00:00:58.050> and<00:00:58.530> we'll<00:00:59.010> get<00:00:59.190> more<00:00:59.370> votes<00:00:59.520> in

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
first place and we'll get more votes in

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.429 
first place and we'll get more votes in
November<00:01:01.910> they<00:01:02.910> think<00:01:03.300> that<00:01:03.420> our<00:01:04.019> economy

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
November they think that our economy

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.670 
November they think that our economy
will<00:01:04.860> do<00:01:05.010> better<00:01:05.189> if<00:01:05.460> we<00:01:05.850> just<00:01:05.880> let<00:01:06.479> the<00:01:07.200> bank's

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
will do better if we just let the bank's

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.440 
will do better if we just let the bank's

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
they still believe that even after the

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.010 
they still believe that even after the
Wall<00:01:15.330> Street<00:01:15.360> Crash<00:01:16.340> even<00:01:17.340> after<00:01:17.640> the<00:01:18.210> BP<00:01:18.570> ool

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
blue that we should just keep a

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.870 
blue that we should just keep a
hands-off<00:01:21.630> attitude<00:01:21.689> they<00:01:22.619> think<00:01:22.890> we<00:01:23.610> should

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880
