00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:15.720
 I began to everyone Hello evening hero 

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:17.330
 We introduce robot soul side ms today 

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:20.450
 It is Kustoria 

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:22.830
 I was waiting privately I was waiting 

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:26.070
 I really waited 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:28.170
 I 'm getting a great tension now 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.600
 Too happy 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:33.770
 I have a second country 

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:37.790
 No, even if it is a box 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:43.160
 This feels like it's compared to a regular-sized robot soul 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:44.540
 Even if it is referred to as a normal size but the endosperm is'm open at the health box 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:47.290
 That's right 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:52.000
 The back of the package looks like this 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:55.240
 Fragile 4 feathers This distinctive 4 binders 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:58.750
 Battle scene with impressive Menicon Gundam 

00:00:55.240 --> 00:01:01.770
 Is that whole body coming out of a psycho frame? 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:07.370
 It is a famous word of famous Marida 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:07.370
 I will open the extra note on this side 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:15.260
 I tried to take out from the box 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:15.260
 The Prestar is a stack of two 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:25.229
 There is a great sense of luxury with this Neodione emblem 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:30.869
 It might be that the same type as this case has been used mountain possibly Once you to metal build 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:32.440
 Other also Kusui Gundam of the large size of the pedestal of the same type had been stuck in the robot soul 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:37.750
 There is a song 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:44.570
 It is already so powerful of the binder It also comes with sabers taken from Rizel 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:50.540
 There are 3 types of wrist parts . There are many funnel effect units. 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:54.950
 I think that accessories attached here is also the minimum necessary, but after all this 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:02:00.010
 It looks like there are a lot of accessories because there are funnel effect parts 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:02:04.560
 Support for the funnel is also included in the clear parts and instructions 

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:09.899
 Although I feel slightly smaller than 1/144 hg 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:12.180
 Even if it compares with the robot soul of this unicorn Gundam series of one head one minute 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:17.819
 I think it's huge 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:23.209
 I will try to open this after this and try to compare it is really cool 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:26.200
 I have a great regret now why I did not buy Stark Jegan 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:31.330
 In opened chestnut Star 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:38.260
 At first it is the Kshatriya main body in the state where the binder is not attached 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:39.820
 The movable range is as follows. The head and shoulders have some degree of limited movement, but the movable range of the leg 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:44.860
 So widely 

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:48.870
 Free posing is decided compared to the existing robot soul 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:52.890
 I tried to compare the same robot soul position Nikon Gundam 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:57.599
 There was a difference in height like this even with 4 sheets of feathers 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:03:02.010
 Blue is fixed at Omoikkiri It is Gelgoog mono eye paint 

00:02:57.599 --> 00:03:04.110
 It's a bit disappointing that it is fixed, but because the size is too small 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:09.319
 It is impossible ish operation to a com is 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:09.319
 Well this is a fix or something thank you 

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:20.980
 This pattern of the chest part is a white paint but it is very beautiful without any protrusion 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:21.760
 I think that all types and types are expressed in a very good sense with semi-gloss 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:24.760
 I will 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:28.360
 There is no projection of the arm and the statue and it is very beautiful 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:34.170
 Though it is binder connection part of this one 

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:38.640
 The binder is not interfered with the movement of the arm because it is independent of the shoulder parts 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:41.370
 The back part looks like this Backpack is removable 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:44.690
 Remove some parts like this 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:49.520
 There is a hole attached to the pedestal of the pedestal 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:50.950
 The back of the armor is simple but there is a mold The back of the sun is pipe like this 

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:57.010
 It has through 

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:58.090
 The parts of the calf thrusters are not painted but color-coded by the configuration of other parts 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:03.160
 It has been made 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:06.410
 Also the sole of the mold is no cutting corners binder is huge ThatLookLikeThis 

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:09.800
 In this way we also deploy funnel racks 

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:13.040
 All funnels are also removable like this 

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:16.629
 Thrusters will independently movable 

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:16.629
 Farm also expand of course 

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:25.790
 The order of binders also moves flexibly like this 

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:29.380
 Let's attach it to the Kshatriya body 

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:33.010
 Yes I attached 4 pieces of finder 

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:37.810
 It feels like it's really self-reliant 

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:39.340
 If you lose the balance a little, it will soon fall over, so the base is a normal display 

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:44.050
 I think it is essential 

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:49.370
 It is already so big if we compare unicorn Gundam with 4 pieces of binders attached 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:50.420
 I would like to thank Andai for faithfully reproducing the height difference which is different 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:53.420
 sa 

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:57.920
 Yes next time I used this part 

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:58.930
 I would like to review the display using the funnel development state and the pedestal etc. 

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:01.680
 I will 

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:01.680
 Then again next time 

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:04.969
 me 

00:05:03.379 --> 00:05:07.689
 me 

00:05:04.969 --> 00:05:07.689
 me
