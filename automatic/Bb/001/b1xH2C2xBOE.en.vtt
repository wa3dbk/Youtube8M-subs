right<00:01:24.479> off<00:01:24.510> the<00:01:24.689> bat<00:01:24.920> man<00:01:25.920> I<00:01:26.220> really<00:01:26.610> like<00:01:26.820> this

right off the bat man I really like this

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.899 
right off the bat man I really like this
cuz<00:01:27.330> your<00:01:27.689> board<00:01:27.990> is<00:01:28.170> fully<00:01:28.500> rotating<00:01:29.250> your

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
cuz your board is fully rotating your

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.590 
cuz your board is fully rotating your
feet<00:01:30.479> are<00:01:30.689> pretty<00:01:31.020> close<00:01:31.409> up<00:01:31.710> in<00:01:31.860> the<00:01:31.979> air

feet are pretty close up in the air

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:34.850 
feet are pretty close up in the air
it'll<00:01:33.600> be<00:01:33.659> easier<00:01:34.020> to<00:01:34.049> see<00:01:34.290> once<00:01:34.530> we<00:01:34.680> do<00:01:34.830> that

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
it'll be easier to see once we do that

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.640

your<00:02:55.680> previous<00:02:55.920> tricks<00:02:56.250> you<00:02:56.370> did<00:02:56.520> say<00:02:56.700> you<00:02:56.760> had

your previous tricks you did say you had
more<00:02:57.180> tricks<00:02:57.510> and<00:02:57.630> I'm<00:02:57.780> wouldn't<00:02:58.590> doubt<00:02:58.710> that

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:58.860 
more tricks and I'm wouldn't doubt that

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:00.230 
more tricks and I'm wouldn't doubt that
you<00:02:58.950> could<00:02:59.160> do<00:02:59.280> it<00:02:59.400> but<00:02:59.580> just<00:02:59.700> make<00:02:59.940> sure<00:02:59.970> you

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:00.240 
you could do it but just make sure you

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:03.350 
you could do it but just make sure you
do<00:03:00.510> get<00:03:01.020> that<00:03:01.230> one<00:03:01.410> because<00:03:02.160> it<00:03:02.550> is<00:03:02.670> easier<00:03:03.060> and

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:03.360 
do get that one because it is easier and

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:04.970 
do get that one because it is easier and
it<00:03:03.540> is<00:03:03.570> a<00:03:03.720> step<00:03:04.080> on<00:03:04.230> the<00:03:04.290> way<00:03:04.380> to<00:03:04.500> tre<00:03:04.740> flips

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
it is a step on the way to tre flips

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:07.220 
it is a step on the way to tre flips
which<00:03:05.160> can<00:03:05.400> definitely<00:03:05.790> help<00:03:05.940> cool<00:03:06.780> so<00:03:06.990> on<00:03:07.080> my

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
which can definitely help cool so on my

which can definitely help cool so on my
try<00:03:07.470> flips<00:03:07.770> look<00:03:08.280> at<00:03:08.460> these<00:03:08.670> ones<00:03:09.030> these<00:03:09.990> ones

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:10.050 
try flips look at these ones these ones

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:12.080 
try flips look at these ones these ones
this<00:03:10.500> day<00:03:10.740> you<00:03:10.800> know<00:03:11.100> is<00:03:11.430> at<00:03:11.640> the<00:03:11.760> end<00:03:11.910> of<00:03:12.030> the

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
this day you know is at the end of the

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:14.510 
this day you know is at the end of the
long<00:03:12.300> day<00:03:12.630> they're<00:03:13.140> not<00:03:13.320> very<00:03:13.800> pop<00:03:14.160> they're

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:14.520 
long day they're not very pop they're

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:18.200 
long day they're not very pop they're
not<00:03:14.700> very<00:03:15.030> high<00:03:15.390> and<00:03:15.980> I<00:03:16.980> kind<00:03:17.370> of<00:03:17.430> like<00:03:17.760> to<00:03:18.000> use

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:18.210 
not very high and I kind of like to use

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:20.000 
not very high and I kind of like to use
these<00:03:18.420> ones<00:03:18.660> as<00:03:18.840> examples<00:03:19.380> because<00:03:19.560> it<00:03:19.740> really

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010 
these ones as examples because it really

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:22.970 
these ones as examples because it really
shows<00:03:20.310> you<00:03:21.300> don't<00:03:21.510> have<00:03:21.690> to<00:03:21.810> pop<00:03:22.080> it<00:03:22.320> into<00:03:22.590> the

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:22.980 
shows you don't have to pop it into the

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:26.030 
shows you don't have to pop it into the
Stars<00:03:23.340> you<00:03:24.210> can<00:03:24.570> just<00:03:24.900> scoop<00:03:25.170> it<00:03:25.290> really<00:03:25.770> hard

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040 
Stars you can just scoop it really hard

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:27.860 
Stars you can just scoop it really hard
and<00:03:26.400> keep<00:03:26.700> the<00:03:26.850> board<00:03:27.120> really<00:03:27.570> close

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870 
and keep the board really close

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:30.170 
and keep the board really close
underneath<00:03:28.290> you<00:03:28.680> and<00:03:28.920> it<00:03:29.580> will<00:03:29.730> still<00:03:29.940> do<00:03:30.150> the

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 
underneath you and it will still do the

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:32.480 
underneath you and it will still do the
full<00:03:30.510> rotation<00:03:31.200> and<00:03:31.440> in<00:03:31.770> fact<00:03:31.980> it's<00:03:32.250> much

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:32.490 
full rotation and in fact it's much

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:35.300 
full rotation and in fact it's much
easier<00:03:32.940> because<00:03:33.630> you're<00:03:34.230> not<00:03:34.440> jumping<00:03:34.860> really

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310 
easier because you're not jumping really

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:37.010 
easier because you're not jumping really
far<00:03:35.700> away<00:03:35.850> from<00:03:36.030> you<00:03:36.360> or<00:03:36.480> anything<00:03:36.720> like<00:03:36.960> that

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:37.020 
far away from you or anything like that

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:39.260 
far away from you or anything like that
but<00:03:37.860> you're<00:03:37.950> just<00:03:38.130> getting<00:03:38.400> that<00:03:38.430> full<00:03:38.880> scoop

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:39.270 
but you're just getting that full scoop

this is the shot right here watch my

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:56.000 
this is the shot right here watch my
back<00:03:54.150> foot<00:03:54.420> my<00:03:54.690> toes<00:03:54.960> will<00:03:55.200> curl<00:03:55.440> down<00:03:55.740> and

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:56.010 
back foot my toes will curl down and

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:58.940 
back foot my toes will curl down and
underneath<00:03:56.370> the<00:03:56.760> side<00:03:57.030> of<00:03:57.300> that<00:03:57.510> board<00:03:57.840> and<00:03:58.230> it

00:03:58.940 --> 00:03:58.950 
underneath the side of that board and it

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:02.060 
underneath the side of that board and it
basically<00:03:59.100> is<00:03:59.700> already<00:04:00.240> at<00:04:00.600> a<00:04:00.810> 90<00:04:01.410> degree<00:04:01.440> turn

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:02.070 
basically is already at a 90 degree turn

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:04.850 
basically is already at a 90 degree turn
by<00:04:03.060> the<00:04:03.150> time<00:04:03.450> I<00:04:03.480> even<00:04:03.690> pop<00:04:04.080> the<00:04:04.320> board<00:04:04.530> on<00:04:04.740> the

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:04.860 
by the time I even pop the board on the

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:08.870 
by the time I even pop the board on the
ground<00:04:05.130> so<00:04:05.970> it's<00:04:06.360> it's<00:04:07.080> just<00:04:07.410> like<00:04:07.620> a<00:04:07.880> super

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:08.880 
ground so it's it's just like a super

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:10.790 
ground so it's it's just like a super
scoop<00:04:09.360> with<00:04:09.570> your<00:04:09.750> back<00:04:09.990> foot<00:04:10.320> and<00:04:10.500> then<00:04:10.680> your
