and<00:00:31.340> now<00:00:31.940> for<00:00:32.119> technique<00:00:33.220> we're<00:00:34.220> gonna<00:00:34.310> begin

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:34.580 
and now for technique we're gonna begin

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:40.930 
and now for technique we're gonna begin
with<00:00:34.760> the<00:00:34.850> basic<00:00:35.440> 1<00:00:36.440> 2<00:00:37.030> 1<00:00:38.030> &amp;<00:00:38.330> 2<00:00:38.360> 1<00:00:38.900> &amp;<00:00:39.650> 2<00:00:40.370> lower<00:00:40.730> and

with the basic 1 2 1 &amp; 2 1 &amp; 2 lower and

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:42.729 
with the basic 1 2 1 &amp; 2 1 &amp; 2 lower and
ask<00:00:41.090> for<00:00:41.239> the<00:00:41.330> head<00:00:41.510> from<00:00:42.350> here<00:00:42.590> we're

00:00:42.729 --> 00:00:42.739 
ask for the head from here we're

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:45.400 
ask for the head from here we're
changing<00:00:42.770> the<00:00:43.250> timing<00:00:43.489> from<00:00:43.930> rock<00:00:44.930> step

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:45.410 
changing the timing from rock step

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:48.220 
changing the timing from rock step
triple<00:00:45.710> step<00:00:46.160> triple<00:00:46.640> step<00:00:46.910> to<00:00:47.360> rock<00:00:47.690> step

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:48.230 
triple step triple step to rock step

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:51.970 
triple step triple step to rock step
step<00:00:48.830> step<00:00:49.280> step<00:00:49.879> step<00:00:50.390> the<00:00:50.690> whole<00:00:50.900> time<00:00:51.200> so

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:51.980 
step step step step the whole time so

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:54.160 
step step step step the whole time so
more<00:00:52.190> of<00:00:52.220> a<00:00:52.400> whole<00:00:52.640> beat<00:00:52.879> or<00:00:53.300> merengue<00:00:53.809> type<00:00:54.020> of

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:54.170 
more of a whole beat or merengue type of

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:56.560 
more of a whole beat or merengue type of
action<00:00:54.530> so<00:00:54.680> we're<00:00:54.800> here<00:00:55.040> one<00:00:55.820> keeping<00:00:56.450> the

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:56.570 
action so we're here one keeping the

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:59.260 
action so we're here one keeping the
hand<00:00:56.750> firmly<00:00:56.960> down<00:00:57.640> then<00:00:58.640> we're<00:00:58.790> gonna<00:00:58.850> track

00:00:59.260 --> 00:00:59.270 
hand firmly down then we're gonna track

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:02.530 
hand firmly down then we're gonna track
through<00:00:59.660> as<00:00:59.930> we<00:01:00.110> step<00:01:00.320> to<00:01:00.410> the<00:01:00.530> side<00:01:00.680> two<00:01:01.540> from

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:02.540 
through as we step to the side two from

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:03.850 
through as we step to the side two from
here<00:01:02.750> you're<00:01:02.900> gonna<00:01:02.989> ask<00:01:03.260> for<00:01:03.470> the<00:01:03.530> hand<00:01:03.710> with

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:03.860 
here you're gonna ask for the hand with

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:05.200 
here you're gonna ask for the hand with
energy<00:01:04.250> keeping<00:01:04.580> this<00:01:04.699> right<00:01:04.909> hand<00:01:05.089> down

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:05.210 
energy keeping this right hand down

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:08.140 
energy keeping this right hand down
stepping<00:01:05.870> across<00:01:06.020> one<00:01:06.880> asked<00:01:07.880> him<00:01:07.970> for<00:01:08.090> the

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:08.150 
stepping across one asked him for the

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:11.560 
stepping across one asked him for the
hand<00:01:08.270> to<00:01:08.979> rocking<00:01:09.979> back<00:01:10.159> one<00:01:10.790> tracking<00:01:11.479> the

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:11.570 
hand to rocking back one tracking the

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:15.630 
hand to rocking back one tracking the
leg<00:01:11.720> through<00:01:12.020> chew<00:01:12.920> asking<00:01:13.640> for<00:01:13.790> the<00:01:13.850> hand<00:01:14.030> one

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:15.640 
leg through chew asking for the hand one

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:18.490 
leg through chew asking for the hand one
two<00:01:16.640> finishing<00:01:17.540> off<00:01:17.659> with<00:01:17.840> your<00:01:17.960> Rock<00:01:18.200> step

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:18.500 
two finishing off with your Rock step

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:22.149 
two finishing off with your Rock step
and<00:01:19.600> you<00:01:20.600> can<00:01:20.750> go<00:01:20.870> into<00:01:21.050> a<00:01:21.170> triple<00:01:21.470> or<00:01:21.800> repeat

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:22.159 
and you can go into a triple or repeat

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:25.300 
and you can go into a triple or repeat
the<00:01:22.310> step<00:01:23.409> keeping<00:01:24.409> that<00:01:24.530> energy<00:01:24.740> and<00:01:25.159> that

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:25.310 
the step keeping that energy and that

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:26.620 
the step keeping that energy and that
exercise<00:01:25.580> that<00:01:25.940> we<00:01:26.060> were<00:01:26.180> talking<00:01:26.600> about

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:26.630 
exercise that we were talking about

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:29.440 
exercise that we were talking about
before<00:01:27.159> become<00:01:28.159> very<00:01:28.340> crucial<00:01:28.909> so<00:01:29.210> if<00:01:29.360> you

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:29.450 
before become very crucial so if you

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:31.270 
before become very crucial so if you
practice<00:01:29.990> in<00:01:30.110> the<00:01:30.200> beginning<00:01:30.500> of<00:01:30.590> you've

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:31.280 
practice in the beginning of you've

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:33.399 
practice in the beginning of you've
become<00:01:31.700> very<00:01:31.940> clear<00:01:32.540> how<00:01:32.720> to<00:01:32.750> shift<00:01:33.140> your<00:01:33.260> hand

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:33.409 
become very clear how to shift your hand

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:35.499 
become very clear how to shift your hand
for<00:01:33.650> one<00:01:33.770> position<00:01:34.070> to<00:01:34.310> the<00:01:34.400> next<00:01:34.430> this<00:01:35.299> step

00:01:35.499 --> 00:01:35.509 
for one position to the next this step

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:37.240 
for one position to the next this step
becomes<00:01:35.810> a<00:01:35.899> lot<00:01:36.049> easier<00:01:36.100> we'll<00:01:37.100> demonstrate

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:37.250 
becomes a lot easier we'll demonstrate

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:45.700 
becomes a lot easier we'll demonstrate

ladies<00:02:51.990> what's<00:02:52.170> really<00:02:52.380> important<00:02:52.830> here<00:02:52.860> is

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.130 
ladies what's really important here is

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:54.980 
ladies what's really important here is
that<00:02:53.310> you<00:02:53.610> understand<00:02:54.180> when<00:02:54.390> the<00:02:54.540> turns<00:02:54.780> are

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:54.990 
that you understand when the turns are

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:57.380 
that you understand when the turns are
coming<00:02:55.020> up<00:02:55.470> you<00:02:55.710> don't<00:02:56.250> want<00:02:56.460> to<00:02:56.580> block<00:02:56.880> a<00:02:56.910> turn

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390 
coming up you don't want to block a turn

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:59.030 
coming up you don't want to block a turn
so<00:02:57.960> it's<00:02:58.140> really<00:02:58.290> important<00:02:58.680> that<00:02:58.740> the<00:02:58.860> arm

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
so it's really important that the arm

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.550 
so it's really important that the arm
has<00:02:59.250> tone<00:02:59.640> and<00:03:00.000> is<00:03:00.240> pliable<00:03:00.600> at<00:03:00.960> the<00:03:01.080> same<00:03:01.260> time

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
has tone and is pliable at the same time

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:04.100 
has tone and is pliable at the same time
so<00:03:02.340> you<00:03:03.000> don't<00:03:03.090> want<00:03:03.300> to<00:03:03.390> be<00:03:03.510> completely

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:04.110 
so you don't want to be completely

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:05.630 
so you don't want to be completely
blocking<00:03:04.380> and<00:03:04.710> from<00:03:04.830> turning<00:03:05.160> you<00:03:05.250> by<00:03:05.430> being

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 
blocking and from turning you by being

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590
