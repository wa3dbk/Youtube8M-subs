played halo 3 didn't play ODST halo is a
very<00:01:24.750> different<00:01:24.990> game<00:01:25.229> from<00:01:25.350> call<00:01:25.560> of<00:01:25.590> duty

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
very different game from call of duty

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.819 
very different game from call of duty
now<00:01:26.490> what<00:01:26.759> I<00:01:26.790> thought<00:01:27.090> is<00:01:27.420> I<00:01:27.450> could<00:01:27.840> just<00:01:28.110> kind

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
now what I thought is I could just kind

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:30.499 
now what I thought is I could just kind
of<00:01:29.040> you<00:01:29.460> know<00:01:29.490> from<00:01:29.880> what<00:01:30.030> I've<00:01:30.119> heard<00:01:30.150> from

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
of you know from what I've heard from

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.840 
of you know from what I've heard from
watching<00:01:30.840> other<00:01:31.100> commentators<00:01:32.100> and<00:01:32.520> some<00:01:32.670> cod

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
watching other commentators and some cod

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.730 
watching other commentators and some cod
game<00:01:33.060> plays<00:01:33.329> that<00:01:33.659> you<00:01:33.869> know<00:01:34.290> it<00:01:34.409> just<00:01:34.439> takes

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
game plays that you know it just takes

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.380 
game plays that you know it just takes
more<00:01:34.950> shots<00:01:35.159> to<00:01:35.310> kill<00:01:35.460> people<00:01:35.850> and<00:01:36.030> this<00:01:36.240> and

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
more shots to kill people and this and

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.530 
more shots to kill people and this and
that<00:01:36.420> and<00:01:36.540> I<00:01:36.689> thought<00:01:36.900> I'd<00:01:37.049> take<00:01:37.799> this<00:01:38.540> my

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
that and I thought I'd take this my

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.230 
that and I thought I'd take this my
melee<00:01:39.990> only<00:01:40.380> gameplay<00:01:41.040> from<00:01:41.100> the<00:01:41.549> cod<00:01:41.759> series

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
melee only gameplay from the cod series

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:47.120 
melee only gameplay from the cod series
and<00:01:42.509> incorporate<00:01:43.470> it<00:01:43.500> into<00:01:43.770> halo<00:01:44.340> and<00:01:45.439> so<00:01:46.439> by

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
and incorporate it into halo and so by

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:48.560 
and incorporate it into halo and so by
playing<00:01:47.430> this<00:01:47.579> I<00:01:47.729> discovered<00:01:48.240> things<00:01:48.360> like

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
playing this I discovered things like

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.139 
playing this I discovered things like
the<00:01:48.840> energy<00:01:49.229> sword<00:01:49.530> and<00:01:49.829> when<00:01:50.820> i<00:01:50.850> discovered

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
the energy sword and when i discovered

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:55.069 
the energy sword and when i discovered
the<00:01:51.299> energy<00:01:51.659> sword<00:01:51.930> I<00:01:52.880> it<00:01:53.880> was<00:01:54.000> like<00:01:54.119> a<00:01:54.149> 1<00:01:54.420> 1<00:01:54.869> hit

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
the energy sword I it was like a 1 1 hit

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:56.480 
the energy sword I it was like a 1 1 hit
kill<00:01:55.110> and<00:01:55.710> it<00:01:55.860> seemed<00:01:56.040> like<00:01:56.159> i<00:01:56.250> could<00:01:56.430> just

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
kill and it seemed like i could just

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.469 
kill and it seemed like i could just
rush<00:01:56.729> people<00:01:56.969> so<00:01:57.479> i<00:01:57.750> called<00:01:58.680> it<00:01:58.890> I<00:01:59.360> compared<00:02:00.360> it

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
rush people so i called it I compared it

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:01.730 
rush people so i called it I compared it
because<00:02:00.689> the<00:02:00.750> only<00:02:00.869> thing<00:02:00.960> I<00:02:01.140> know<00:02:01.200> is<00:02:01.350> called

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
because the only thing I know is called

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.039 
because the only thing I know is called
a<00:02:01.829> duty<00:02:02.100> so<00:02:02.670> I<00:02:02.729> compared<00:02:03.090> it<00:02:03.180> to<00:02:03.240> commando<00:02:03.780> and

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049

of<00:03:01.299> came<00:03:01.450> up<00:03:01.510> with<00:03:01.780> is<00:03:01.959> a<00:03:02.140> I<00:03:02.230> did<00:03:02.470> explain

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:02.860 
of came up with is a I did explain

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:07.589 
of came up with is a I did explain
myself<00:03:03.069> like<00:03:03.430> I<00:03:03.959> talked<00:03:04.959> about<00:03:05.370> the<00:03:06.599> energy

00:03:07.589 --> 00:03:07.599 
myself like I talked about the energy

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:09.720 
myself like I talked about the energy
sword<00:03:08.170> as<00:03:08.349> if<00:03:08.500> it's<00:03:08.680> the<00:03:08.829> new<00:03:08.950> commando<00:03:09.519> but

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:09.730 
sword as if it's the new commando but

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:12.539

00:03:12.539 --> 00:03:12.549 
apparently the energy sword has always

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:15.240 
apparently the energy sword has always

and when you if you take like another

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:44.970 
and when you if you take like another
analogy<00:03:43.120> if<00:03:43.329> you<00:03:43.450> take<00:03:43.750> like<00:03:44.049> nothing<00:03:44.859> but

analogy if you take like nothing but

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:47.009 
analogy if you take like nothing but
basketball<00:03:45.190> players<00:03:45.639> right<00:03:46.000> and<00:03:46.209> then<00:03:46.870> you

00:03:47.009 --> 00:03:47.019 
basketball players right and then you

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:48.900 
basketball players right and then you
have<00:03:47.260> them<00:03:47.470> go<00:03:47.709> play<00:03:47.920> football<00:03:48.100> and<00:03:48.579> then

two reasons eh i think melee only in
halo<00:04:21.880> is<00:04:21.940> a<00:04:22.000> cool<00:04:22.240> idea<00:04:22.390> it's<00:04:22.840> more<00:04:23.080> of<00:04:23.140> a

00:04:23.159 --> 00:04:23.169 
halo is a cool idea it's more of a

00:04:23.169 --> 00:04:24.320 
halo is a cool idea it's more of a
challenge

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:24.330 
challenge

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:25.850 
challenge
and<00:04:24.479> I'm<00:04:24.569> still<00:04:24.810> getting<00:04:24.900> used<00:04:25.050> to<00:04:25.289> it<00:04:25.439> I<00:04:25.590> think

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:25.860 
and I'm still getting used to it I think

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:27.710 
and I'm still getting used to it I think
that<00:04:26.159> I've<00:04:26.400> I've<00:04:27.060> always<00:04:27.270> try<00:04:27.449> to<00:04:27.509> bring

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:27.720 
that I've I've always try to bring

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:30.140 
that I've I've always try to bring
itself<00:04:28.139> some<00:04:28.439> different<00:04:28.919> and<00:04:29.129> so<00:04:29.460> by<00:04:29.849> me

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:30.150 
itself some different and so by me

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:33.170 
itself some different and so by me
showing<00:04:31.050> you<00:04:31.229> you<00:04:31.889> know<00:04:32.039> full<00:04:32.520> game<00:04:32.729> plays<00:04:33.000> of

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:33.180 
showing you you know full game plays of

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:35.460 
me winning in Halo melee only I think

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:36.230 
me winning in Halo melee only I think
that'd<00:04:35.550> be<00:04:35.669> pretty<00:04:35.789> cool<00:04:35.909> and<00:04:36.180> be

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:37.909 
that'd be pretty cool and be
entertaining<00:04:36.659> plus<00:04:37.050> the<00:04:37.169> assassinations<00:04:37.800> are

00:04:37.909 --> 00:04:37.919
