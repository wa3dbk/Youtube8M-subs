00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:10.500
 if 2014 represented a year filled with 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.519
 controversies for the 2015 fc began 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.160
 more controversy 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:15.389
 perhaps the biggest bomb in the history of the 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.609
 organization 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:19.650
 jon jones after going through daniel 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:21.660
 cormier this eighth title defense 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.910
 must be found in the exam 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.539
 conducted one month prior to the 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.090
 fight 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:29.730
 the examination showed remnants of cocaine 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:33.059
 in the champion body what caused a 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:35.100
 real stir in the world of MMA to 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:37.710
 my side carlos antunes will help me 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:40.500
 analyze what all this means for 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:45.539
 the world of mma carlos first thing 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:47.250
 how much is this news and if this 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:51.239
 impact it has on your opinion 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:53.520
 inside the fc ebe where is the 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.590
 biggest name of the fc in the actuality what your 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:58.500
 opinion about this was the 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:00.059
 real bomb exploded in a logo 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.329
 after a historic event that the 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:06.479
 jones won eating I think you have 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:08.010
 a jones magnitude champion grabs 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:10.590
 for example with cocaine 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:13.080
 It was ugly, I think it's going to be a 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.000
 spot on his career. 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.890
 meriting cross that he has already made and 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.070
 I think the talent he has is 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:23.850
 separate from it but it will deal with 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:25.560
 this whole life should be dealing with 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:28.320
 this situation will also complicate already 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:31.380
 provided support but we will see the unfolding 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:33.000
 to go out to anyone who asks is 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.590
 the first impression we have 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
 when we hear the news what goes 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.650
 happen with jon jones 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.659
 only who will lose the belt will be 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:42.390
 will continue champion to start 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:45.329
 people can say that by the test have 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:47.009
 been made out of competition if he was 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:48.570
 done a month before and was done on day 4 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:50.640
 nearly a month before the fight 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.740
 against ate so much for being made out 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.350
 the athletic committee does not 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:57.630
 can punish where today because the substance 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:00.840
 found in the body of the champion 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:02.549
 she is not on the blacklist of 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.020
 worldwide anti-doping organization 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:05.610
 world anti dopping agency 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.789
 where it can not be punished by the 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:10.890
 Commission can now be punished by the 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:13.660
 f60 on ethics we have cases 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:14.950
 from fighters like messi o ihru 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:16.300
 what days to face himself 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:18.820
 anderson silva who were caught with 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:21.370
 marijuana in the body and were punished 

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:23.290
 by organizing the difference here 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:25.780
 people have to stress the staff understand 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:27.550
 they got caught up in competition this week 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:31.420
 the different jonas fight that was 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:34.000
 outside and are substances that are not 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:35.230
 do not increase to not improve 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.680
 performance of the fighter within the 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:40.180
 octagon so it does not have any type 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:41.410
 within the performance of the 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:43.420
 fighter in case 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:45.190
 what do you think that the workshop will take 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:47.920
 some attitude towards this the seven 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:49.420
 It's going to be all that way It's the way it is 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:51.910
 what is there where will keep champion 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:54.880
 It was personal, I was finding this 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:56.710
 is the idea of where to increase cocaine 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:58.870
 increase yield because 

00:02:56.710 --> 00:03:01.480
 he was punished because he was not punished 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:04.360
 right and buying the much contested trt 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:07.810
 Nélson is different. 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:09.730
 The trt boosts the athlete's performance is 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:11.410
 something else, it's no use having this 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:12.880
 comparison because it does not hit 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:16.780
 I think it's two weights two measures 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:19.780
 in the uefs and pune available the river was 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:21.190
 dismissed until 2012 will not think that 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:24.209
 It's going to happen the same thing I think 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:26.920
 may even have an ear tug on it but 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:28.510
 jonas is a champion, he does not die bigger 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:31.810
 star of the organization at the time then 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:34.959
 It's been a hard day to see Dana. 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:37.060
 white already uniron jones is suspend by 

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:39.490
 A few months without fighting is not going to happen. 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:41.380
 I do not believe this has already provided support already 

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:43.360
 said he's proud of jon 

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:45.910
 jones has already gone to a clinic 

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:48.220
 then it is difficult to know a punishment of 

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:50.470
 jean and we can notice some of this 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:53.950
 in Dana's own official communiqué 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:55.840
 that in the first word the 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:58.870
 first words from his statement 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:00.970
 was that he is proud that he is already 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:02.980
 Unbelievable it get that way 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:04.600
 more on a road can we 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:06.780
 noted with spectacular strategy 

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:09.040
 marketing here I fc ends 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:11.350
 transforming this whole story 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:13.660
 this controversy in a tale of heroism 

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:15.459
 city where it is not punished in a few 

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:17.320
 months he comes back and goes back as a 

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:21.609
 the guy who beat drugs in the 

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:23.680
 home and arrived at this point 

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:25.210
 recover to get back on top 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:27.490
 It is also important to highlight that 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:28.810
 besides the examination done by where 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:31.000
 out of competition on December 4 

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:33.849
 he also passed an exam in the week 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:36.190
 of the fight, which means that if 

00:04:33.849 --> 00:04:38.590
 he dropped the exam if they presented 

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:40.630
 traces of cocaine also in this 

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:42.759
 then yes he will be punished by the 

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:45.009
 and the fight is automatically 

00:04:42.759 --> 00:04:46.870
 transforms a new account without result 

00:04:45.009 --> 00:04:47.560
 fight against the economy and it loses its 

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:50.620
 belt 

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:52.120
 ever wondered where does the rate was mine and 

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:53.380
 I do not think I even knew what to do. 

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:55.180
 after that 

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:58.569
 I stay in the crowd so I do not fall 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:05:00.550
 he is clean our fight that has 

00:04:58.569 --> 00:05:02.770
 fought clean not to have this revolt 

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:04.569
 All lost his belt after he had 

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:06.699
 expired in such a good way 

00:05:04.569 --> 00:05:08.470
 I'll be cheering is now await the 

00:05:06.699 --> 00:05:11.110
 check out what the next 

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:13.960
 chapters of this novel he started the year 

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:17.199
 A geek, it's for us to finish. 

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:19.840
 believer ask them what influences 

00:05:17.199 --> 00:05:22.180
 this new generation of fighters who where 

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:24.250
 he is a champion should be is an example is 

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:26.560
 a guy who many have to put a 

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:28.389
 pedestal as an example to be followed and 

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:32.680
 we suddenly know he never 

00:05:28.389 --> 00:05:34.960
 had a posture is of discipline of de 

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:36.550
 please fans has always been a guy in 

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:39.340
 recent times and more than normal 

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:41.620
 always been a very controversial guy but a 

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:43.960
 face getting involved with drugs will face 

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:45.370
 a fight against drugs is something very 

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:47.680
 with a tie if you think this can 

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:49.509
 have for the generation that is coming 

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:51.580
 fighters up to the other fighters 

00:05:49.509 --> 00:05:52.360
 the organization that has such a great 

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:53.500
 champion 

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:55.780
 I think he might be arrested too. 

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:57.190
 for example it was taken for example 

00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:59.289
 many good things may be the next 

00:05:57.190 --> 00:06:01.150
 It's a bad thing, too. Cocaine is a drug. 

00:05:59.289 --> 00:06:03.550
 very serious you can destroy the 

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:05.620
 career of a young athlete others 

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:07.780
 sports people who do not heal, right? 

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:09.430
 service is a very serious addiction 

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:11.620
 I think it may have been with the foot like 

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:13.090
 example of these arriving kids 

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:15.370
 I do not think it should even qualify 

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:18.370
 today 11 bottles also as a marginal 

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:20.889
 as a thug is not a sick guy either 

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:23.289
 is suffering from this is an addiction was caught 

00:06:20.889 --> 00:06:26.229
 It has to be suffering has to go through 

00:06:23.289 --> 00:06:28.389
 a clean rehab does not 

00:06:26.229 --> 00:06:30.759
 It's clean but I think that too. 

00:06:28.389 --> 00:06:33.490
 is not even a champion who already has champion 

00:06:30.759 --> 00:06:34.990
 and this is not always the case. 

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:37.810
 enough but the guys that are starting 

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:39.190
 It's good to keep an eye on temptation. 

00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:40.409
 big right 

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:43.649
 the fame 

00:06:40.409 --> 00:06:45.839
 much today appear tied appear 

00:06:43.649 --> 00:06:47.839
 good to keep an eye out for falling like 

00:06:45.839 --> 00:06:49.909
 today we never expected 

00:06:47.839 --> 00:06:52.649
 particularly, I never expected it to be 

00:06:49.909 --> 00:06:54.149
 cocaine so a very serious thing 

00:06:52.649 --> 00:06:56.189
 Let's see how it's going to be now. 

00:06:54.149 --> 00:06:59.369
 I hope he gets reinstated. 

00:06:56.189 --> 00:07:00.389
 to fight exactly is good to us is to separate 

00:06:59.369 --> 00:07:02.309
 a little things 

00:07:00.389 --> 00:07:03.929
 it is clear that the sport is bad the champion 

00:07:02.309 --> 00:07:05.489
 bad if he will keep the belt or 

00:07:03.929 --> 00:07:07.889
 No, but we have to think about the side. 

00:07:05.489 --> 00:07:10.800
 human being that cocaine is a very 

00:07:07.889 --> 00:07:13.409
 seriously has already broken a career 

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:14.939
 others hit the sport today where he 

00:07:13.409 --> 00:07:16.800
 is at the height of his career will have to 

00:07:14.939 --> 00:07:18.959
 facing this is something very big that 

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:21.779
 this really becomes a story 

00:07:18.959 --> 00:07:24.449
 positive that he can go through all 

00:07:21.779 --> 00:07:26.129
 this challenge that will lie ahead and 

00:07:24.449 --> 00:07:27.149
 that you can do as well as you can 

00:07:26.129 --> 00:07:29.669
 inside the octagon 

00:07:27.149 --> 00:07:32.309
 the northern focus was a statement from them 

00:07:29.669 --> 00:07:33.809
 It is so early for recovery that he 

00:07:32.309 --> 00:07:36.360
 shows the champion also out of the octagon 

00:07:33.809 --> 00:07:38.519
 like monster inside all these years is 

00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:40.169
 the stronger the return over and back the 

00:07:38.519 --> 00:07:42.719
 as fast as possible which is what the 

00:07:40.169 --> 00:07:44.759
 waiting outside fans is this you 

00:07:42.719 --> 00:07:46.800
 Do you want to know the next chapters? 

00:07:44.759 --> 00:07:49.679
 unveil all this controversy, which 

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:51.509
 will happen with jones or not in fc if
