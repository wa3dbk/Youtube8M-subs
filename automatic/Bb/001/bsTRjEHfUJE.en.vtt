00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:07.689
 after the fair formerly called 3gsm that is greater than 1 mo 

00:00:07.689 --> 00:00:08.849
 country with press 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:11.729
 laura sabala without having changed the man probo is not like that 

00:00:11.729 --> 00:00:16.199
 attracts all the professionals of the sector say we are here all 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:17.119
 years 

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:18.080
 the same 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:19.349
 we do not recognize 

00:00:19.349 --> 00:00:22.970
 we have changed some because even because I'm still here blatter for a while 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:24.210
 change company 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.490
 but the good thing is that we are commenting on them 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.619
 where are we going what are the trends 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:31.630
 a certain freedom to be able to speak 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:33.920
 from us what we bring 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:37.560
 unlike the last two fairs where moss released a device 

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:40.749
 two years ago we planted the 87 0 0 

00:00:40.749 --> 00:00:45.349
 last year 88 0 0 this year we focused on applications in 

00:00:45.349 --> 00:00:47.240
 solutions around blackberry 

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:48.780
 we want our 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.240
 let's say he is not a user 

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:51.740
 understand that black berry 

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:53.010
 it's a glove for him 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.220
 where most read content 

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:58.150
 more satisfied to get to use that device 

00:00:58.150 --> 00:00:59.400
 therefore we have brought 

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:00.359
 On one side 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:01.520
 for what it is 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:04.950
 we gave that new market where we are being kessel market 

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:09.210
 - more professional corporate without reaching pure consumption 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.680
 we have advanced the blackberry and an ips that is a small free software that 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.590
 you download luis talas fattening house 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.840
 and you can up to five blackberry 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.520
 control them remotely with orio control them say it's a series of 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:23.910
 policies that you can put 

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:25.170
 for example, imagine what 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:26.950
 to your children of those one blackberry 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:30.219
 you are saying 'look, I want you can not take internationally 

00:01:30.219 --> 00:01:33.000
 you can not send that month either abroad 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.660
 and what can a series do and then you gave yourself 

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:39.660
 You can do the console of your computer and they can remotely 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:41.030
 they receive 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:42.550
 those policies 

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:45.830
 that they will control by their blackberry therefore it is a bit the game 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:47.920
 private corporate home 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:50.189
 and it makes you able to share with them 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:53.599
 everything that in that order ornament will happen the photos that I take 

00:01:53.599 --> 00:01:54.729
 they sound computer 

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:57.890
 they can see us download such and such sounds 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:01:59.290
 order is a handling 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:01.060
 lat family 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:01.960
 on the other hand 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:05.910
 applications solutions that as you can see here in our are 

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:09.560
 We have many developers who have come with us to be able 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:10.280
 to show 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:11.819
 his latest news 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:14.249
 but I can say that we are more and more focused 

00:02:14.249 --> 00:02:15.119
 in that 

00:02:15.119 --> 00:02:18.119
 that are not devices by the officials that are giving 

00:02:18.659 --> 00:02:20.149
 possibly pointers 

00:02:20.149 --> 00:02:23.479
 the gps built into a device that has a flat rate 

00:02:23.999 --> 00:02:26.859
 h really interesting the use of data 

00:02:26.859 --> 00:02:30.779
 and then here we have many partners many let's see developers 

00:02:30.779 --> 00:02:31.419
 What are they 

00:02:31.419 --> 00:02:32.789
 on the other hand the ring 

00:02:32.789 --> 00:02:33.889
 to be offering 

00:02:33.889 --> 00:02:36.399
 that solution is around our 

00:02:36.399 --> 00:02:38.319
 absence gps 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:40.069
 you can to it for example 

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:41.609
 for taking a picture 

00:02:41.609 --> 00:02:44.339
 that photography thanks to the geopositioning 

00:02:44.339 --> 00:02:48.159
 that gives you gps automatically uploads to a web page that you have 

00:02:48.159 --> 00:02:49.469
 created previously 

00:02:49.469 --> 00:02:53.420
 and you see positioned exactly in the place where you see the photograph that 

00:02:53.419 --> 00:02:54.179
 Photography 

00:02:54.179 --> 00:02:56.059
 you receive a pdf 

00:02:56.059 --> 00:02:57.059
 your blackberry 

00:02:57.059 --> 00:02:58.179
 you can see 

00:02:58.179 --> 00:03:01.009
 with the exact location of the photo and that photo landÃ­n 

00:03:01.009 --> 00:03:02.649
 and three this allows you 

00:03:02.649 --> 00:03:07.549
 many professional developments around a more playful solution 

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:10.009
 since we want because it allows 

00:03:10.009 --> 00:03:11.580
 being used more and more 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:13.150
 by people who are going on a trip 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:15.649
 to take your vacation pictures 

00:03:15.649 --> 00:03:18.809
 because in him also another that is very beautiful and very funny 

00:03:18.809 --> 00:03:22.149
 how many of us have lost the car when he leaves them parked he released a car 

00:03:22.149 --> 00:03:22.650
 rental 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:25.029
 how it happens to me 

00:03:25.029 --> 00:03:28.779
 you get out of and when we go through today it expands to burn that calfire cooks 

00:03:28.779 --> 00:03:30.389
 and what color do you remember? 

00:03:30.389 --> 00:03:33.619
 I can get off the car makes the car from your blackberry 

00:03:33.619 --> 00:03:35.209
 and that position is welcomed 

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:38.809
 and when two cheeks today and take me to blackberry stroller are committed 

00:03:38.809 --> 00:03:39.590
 a compass 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:42.519
 and it takes you directly to your car 

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:44.529
 they are putin simple things 

00:03:44.529 --> 00:03:45.449
 i like that 

00:03:45.449 --> 00:03:46.799
 many more say 

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:49.110
 partners we have more than 750 

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:50.349
 worldwide 

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:53.070
 what are we going to put together in three months? 

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:57.050
 in the most important fair that every year we organize kessel symposium 

00:03:58.129 --> 00:03:59.859
 efe mobile solutions 

00:03:59.859 --> 00:04:02.479
 that rim organizes once a year in the united states 

00:04:02.479 --> 00:04:04.219
 and therefore there we already get together 

00:04:04.219 --> 00:04:07.569
 those around blackberry are growing partners 

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:11.559
 operators like ourselves and there we also share a lot that is a 

00:04:11.559 --> 00:04:13.159
 first step towards 

00:04:13.159 --> 00:04:16.159
 in three months what we love hawks 

00:04:16.819 --> 00:04:18.689
 What else can I say 

00:04:18.689 --> 00:04:20.510
 good when they talk about the competition 

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:23.419
 competition I do not know to whom there is like us 

00:04:23.419 --> 00:04:25.979
 that we offer a fully integrated solution 

00:04:25.979 --> 00:04:27.550
 say a device 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:28.710
 I want to be the best 

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:31.409
 nor will it be the worst presume is positive perfect 

00:04:31.409 --> 00:04:33.500
 for the integration of all towards solutions 

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:34.999
 that are also our 

00:04:34.999 --> 00:04:39.259
 therefore we manufacture the device we develop the operating system 

00:04:39.259 --> 00:04:42.800
 and the solutions that are behind us from our partners are integrated 

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:44.539
 inside the devices 

00:04:44.539 --> 00:04:46.469
 an integrated solution 

00:04:46.469 --> 00:04:48.460
 I have been asked many times poyet 

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:52.050
 the output of these new devices we are going to put a name 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:53.230
 the iphone for example 

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:56.229
 It is some challenge or some risk for you 

00:04:56.229 --> 00:04:57.610
 I can tell you 

00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:59.130
 from the output of the iphone 

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:03.379
 there, taken an important part within what is the market before the 

00:05:03.379 --> 00:05:07.430
 smart devices if you see the data that just published canalis 

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:11.340
 has passed 0% because it was not there was a year ago the iphone 

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:12.919
 still six and a half percent 

00:05:12.919 --> 00:05:14.819
 in aim in a very short 

00:05:14.819 --> 00:05:17.990
 we have made progress and we have decided an end 121 percent 

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:20.870
 compared to the previous year that we have already grown 

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:22.689
 well above the others 

00:05:22.689 --> 00:05:26.149
 who is losing I'm not going to tell you because the data so and published 

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:30.129
 the entry of a new competitor what it does is that the market 

00:05:30.129 --> 00:05:32.719
 between an increasingly rapid fizz 

00:05:32.719 --> 00:05:35.270
 and that this makes people understand what it is 

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:38.460
 much more important is to have a smart device 

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:40.520
 although you use it with little intelligence 

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:41.999
 by the device 

00:05:41.999 --> 00:05:44.089
 but that has the ability to do it 

00:05:44.089 --> 00:05:45.809
 Regarding buying a device 

00:05:45.809 --> 00:05:47.889
 silly that serves you for few things 

00:05:47.889 --> 00:05:51.099
 I do not want to say that there is not a market for the whole thing 

00:05:51.099 --> 00:05:54.569
 but that the growth will go increasingly towards the market of 3 20 in force 

00:05:54.569 --> 00:05:56.389
 what will allow you 

00:05:56.389 --> 00:05:58.360
 decide how you want to configure it 

00:05:58.360 --> 00:05:59.379
 chile wants to be 

00:05:59.379 --> 00:06:02.520
 I do not know how to say a non-violet tonality like mine gave a tonality 

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:04.990
 more geared towards gps 

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:06.680
 or more oriented towards 

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:09.740
 let's see your work is to be able to put printing solutions 

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:12.770
 to be able to print anywhere to be able to edit 

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:13.810
 texas such and such 

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:17.460
 or you decide the orientation you want to apply to your device 

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:20.419
 because being an intelligent device adapts to it 

00:06:20.419 --> 00:06:23.819
 and three the entrance to the iphone what will allow is that the market and what already 

00:06:23.819 --> 00:06:24.510
 allowed 

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:27.169
 is that the market evolution and much more quickly 

00:06:27.169 --> 00:06:28.610
 towards a migration 

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:29.860
 of usual phone 

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:33.080
 Pele was smart and that suits us all absolutely
