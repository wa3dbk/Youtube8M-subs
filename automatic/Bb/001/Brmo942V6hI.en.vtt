I guess on the other side you know in

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:09.980 
I guess on the other side you know in
terms<00:01:08.820> of<00:01:09.000> a<00:01:09.180> little<00:01:09.570> bit<00:01:09.689> of<00:01:09.780> recreational

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
terms of a little bit of recreational

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.350 
terms of a little bit of recreational
stuff<00:01:10.770> like<00:01:11.010> you<00:01:11.400> know<00:01:11.460> cheats<00:01:11.850> and<00:01:12.119> things

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.359 
stuff like you know cheats and things
like<00:01:12.540> that<00:01:12.600> in<00:01:12.840> car<00:01:13.080> customization<00:01:13.619> whatever

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369

well<00:02:05.329> so<00:02:06.329> that<00:02:06.540> kind<00:02:07.020> of<00:02:07.079> stuff<00:02:07.259> either<00:02:07.680> got

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
well so that kind of stuff either got

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.680 
well so that kind of stuff either got
missed<00:02:08.190> or<00:02:08.550> it<00:02:08.819> just<00:02:09.000> wasn't<00:02:09.300> very<00:02:09.360> good

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
missed or it just wasn't very good

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:10.550 
missed or it just wasn't very good
because<00:02:09.810> it<00:02:09.989> was<00:02:10.080> a<00:02:10.110> lot<00:02:10.259> of

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
because it was a lot of

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.800 
because it was a lot of
more<00:02:10.679> stuff<00:02:11.039> well<00:02:11.250> Rockstar<00:02:12.000> have<00:02:12.030> focused<00:02:12.630> on

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
more stuff well Rockstar have focused on

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:15.290 
more stuff well Rockstar have focused on
a<00:02:13.230> lot<00:02:13.890> of<00:02:14.010> the<00:02:14.069> bigger<00:02:14.280> stuff<00:02:14.640> the<00:02:14.849> more<00:02:15.000> fun

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
a lot of the bigger stuff the more fun

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.650 
a lot of the bigger stuff the more fun
stuff<00:02:15.720> okay<00:02:16.050> stuff<00:02:16.319> that<00:02:16.470> you<00:02:16.560> can<00:02:16.709> do<00:02:16.890> and<00:02:17.130> and

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:17.660 
stuff okay stuff that you can do and and

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:21.080 
stuff okay stuff that you can do and and
probably<00:02:18.660> you<00:02:19.200> know<00:02:19.380> tweak<00:02:20.130> make<00:02:20.670> it<00:02:20.819> yours

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
probably you know tweak make it yours

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:23.030 
probably you know tweak make it yours
make<00:02:21.569> it<00:02:21.750> so<00:02:21.989> that<00:02:22.140> you<00:02:22.230> can<00:02:22.440> be<00:02:22.560> good<00:02:22.590> at<00:02:22.800> this

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
make it so that you can be good at this

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:24.500 
make it so that you can be good at this
something<00:02:23.340> that<00:02:23.489> requires<00:02:23.970> a<00:02:24.060> little<00:02:24.270> bit<00:02:24.480> a

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
something that requires a little bit a

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:27.380 
something that requires a little bit a
bit<00:02:24.959> of<00:02:25.080> skill<00:02:25.319> to<00:02:25.530> do<00:02:25.650> well<00:02:25.860> in<00:02:26.010> and<00:02:26.970> some<00:02:27.239> is

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
bit of skill to do well in and some is

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:30.920 
bit of skill to do well in and some is
just<00:02:27.420> for<00:02:28.290> pure<00:02:28.980> relaxation<00:02:29.730> all<00:02:30.599> right<00:02:30.720> for

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
just for pure relaxation all right for

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:33.500 
just for pure relaxation all right for
example<00:02:31.069> cycling<00:02:32.069> is<00:02:32.340> probably<00:02:33.120> for

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
example cycling is probably for

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:36.020 
example cycling is probably for
relaxation<00:02:34.290> for<00:02:34.440> me<00:02:34.560> in<00:02:34.680> the<00:02:34.769> gameplay<00:02:34.950> we<00:02:35.730> saw

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
relaxation for me in the gameplay we saw

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:38.360 
relaxation for me in the gameplay we saw
you<00:02:36.660> know<00:02:36.840> cycling<00:02:37.560> and<00:02:37.709> I<00:02:37.800> think<00:02:38.010> there<00:02:38.220> were

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
you know cycling and I think there were

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:40.370 
you know cycling and I think there were
different<00:02:38.730> places<00:02:38.970> you<00:02:39.390> know<00:02:39.780> so<00:02:39.959> if<00:02:40.050> you<00:02:40.170> came

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380 
different places you know so if you came

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:42.199 
different places you know so if you came
first<00:02:40.709> maybe<00:02:41.040> there's<00:02:41.280> races<00:02:41.670> and<00:02:41.819> money<00:02:42.030> to

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:42.209 
first maybe there's races and money to

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:44.210 
first maybe there's races and money to
be<00:02:42.330> won<00:02:42.540> or<00:02:42.690> perhaps<00:02:43.350> it's<00:02:43.830> just<00:02:43.890> you<00:02:44.130> know

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
be won or perhaps it's just you know

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:45.289 
be won or perhaps it's just you know
different<00:02:44.580> things<00:02:44.640> like<00:02:44.940> that<00:02:45.090> and<00:02:45.209> of<00:02:45.269> course

00:02:45.289 --> 00:02:45.299 
different things like that and of course

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:47.840 
different things like that and of course
the<00:02:45.600> more<00:02:45.750> you<00:02:45.780> do<00:02:46.019> you<00:02:46.590> can<00:02:46.739> almost<00:02:46.890> assume

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:47.850 
the more you do you can almost assume

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:50.000 
the more you do you can almost assume
that<00:02:48.269> different<00:02:48.870> parts<00:02:49.080> of<00:02:49.380> cycling<00:02:49.860> are

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
that different parts of cycling are

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:51.890 
that different parts of cycling are
gonna<00:02:50.160> have<00:02:50.430> you<00:02:50.730> know<00:02:50.819> almost<00:02:51.180> like<00:02:51.330> races<00:02:51.750> in

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
gonna have you know almost like races in

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.530 
gonna have you know almost like races in
GTA<00:02:52.230> 4<00:02:52.350> where<00:02:52.799> you'd<00:02:52.950> have<00:02:53.160> a<00:02:53.430> series<00:02:54.209> of<00:02:54.239> them

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
GTA 4 where you'd have a series of them

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.360 
GTA 4 where you'd have a series of them
that<00:02:54.720> you<00:02:54.810> could<00:02:54.959> go<00:02:55.080> off<00:02:55.260> and<00:02:55.410> do<00:02:55.590> similar

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
that you could go off and do similar

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:58.940 
that you could go off and do similar
similar<00:02:57.209> to<00:02:57.450> motocross<00:02:57.840> riding<00:02:58.140> and<00:02:58.500> quad

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
similar to motocross riding and quad

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:00.410 
similar to motocross riding and quad
biking<00:02:59.250> and<00:02:59.580> stuff<00:02:59.790> that's<00:02:59.940> probably<00:03:00.299> going

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
biking and stuff that's probably going

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:03.020 
biking and stuff that's probably going
to<00:03:00.480> be<00:03:00.599> around<00:03:00.720> as<00:03:01.019> well<00:03:01.170> which<00:03:01.709> will<00:03:01.980> all<00:03:02.610> you

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
to be around as well which will all you

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:04.520 
to be around as well which will all you
know<00:03:03.180> through<00:03:03.420> the<00:03:03.540> mountains<00:03:04.019> that's<00:03:04.230> got<00:03:04.410> to

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
know through the mountains that's got to

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:07.220 
know through the mountains that's got to
be<00:03:04.620> a<00:03:04.650> great<00:03:05.010> experience<00:03:05.190> aside<00:03:06.150> from<00:03:06.510> all<00:03:06.930> of

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
be a great experience aside from all of

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:08.809 
be a great experience aside from all of
the<00:03:07.290> shooting<00:03:07.769> the<00:03:07.920> hunting<00:03:08.370> which<00:03:08.549> is<00:03:08.700> of

00:03:08.809 --> 00:03:08.819 
the shooting the hunting which is of

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:09.949 
the shooting the hunting which is of
course<00:03:09.060> there<00:03:09.360> as<00:03:09.540> well

00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:09.959 
course there as well

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:12.350 
course there as well
hunting<00:03:10.650> is<00:03:10.860> probably<00:03:11.580> going<00:03:11.790> to<00:03:11.849> be<00:03:12.000> a<00:03:12.030> case

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:12.360 
hunting is probably going to be a case
