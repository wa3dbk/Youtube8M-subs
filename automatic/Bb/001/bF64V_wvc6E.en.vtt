00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:11.700
 after a hispano z released at the good sony 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.049
 plunges on the segment of the fable 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:17.400
 is extreme 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:21.240
 with this ultra hysteria z 6.44 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:23.609
 inch we will discover it together on 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:27.060
 this z usait train we find the same 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:29.880
 the same aesthetic codes so 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.980
 facades with green resistance 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.550
 which really marks beyond 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.440
 design 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.600
 that's aesthetic code there we find 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.550
 especially this retouch this key in 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.170
 metal that is now it's done 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.540
 part of the xperia smartphones dna 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:45.329
 so smartphones sony 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.829
 it is an aluminum contour which 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.289
 really mark when we take the 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:52.440
 terminal in hand went its weight 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:55.949
 and its thickness 212 grams for a 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:58.680
 machine that is 6 44 inches is enough 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:01.079
 impressive ditto on the 6.5 thickness 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.270
 mm no there really we have a product a 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.949
 time in hand that's good that's all 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:08.760
 simply that is very impressive 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:10.650
 a screen of 6 44 inches a full hd screen 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.820
 it is the largest contour screen 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:15.060
 currently on a smartphone 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:16.530
 the war at the waist a screen so I 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.820
 say full hd ip is what is 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.520
 interesting is that it works with 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.860
 any pencil or pen 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.590
 ball there are two applications that 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.049
 allow to exploit 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:31.820
 it's possible there with such a 

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:35.179
 input tool found here 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:37.520
 here it works frankly not too bad 

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:40.610
 it's not extraordinary but that's it 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:42.469
 this is what is honest we will say that it is 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:45.289
 a prototype and that it can improve 

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:47.630
 a very big screen but also heavy 

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:49.189
 inside level configuration it's 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:54.619
 simply what it is 

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:57.319
 better with a quad core snapdragon 804 

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:58.970
 heart to 2.2 gigahertz of giga of ram 

00:01:57.319 --> 00:02:01.909
 I ran a small benchmark there 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:03.619
 we're going to see that on our little 

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:06.500
 Belgian speaking so I put in heap all 

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:09.110
 is at the level of Belgian good bah that's it 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:13.489
 send it sends heavy necessarily 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:15.739
 is at 35 1098 very far from a s4 knowing 

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:19.129
 that the escat will also be proposed with 

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:20.360
 a snapdragon 800 the one the ispaia z which 

00:02:19.129 --> 00:02:23.200
 here is good here are the numbers 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:26.000
 illustrate without any problem the performance 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:29.420
 it's a terminal that's also 4 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.780
 g4g the latest generation including 450 mega 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:33.079
 bit 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:35.239
 it's nfc nfc it's a specificity 

00:02:33.079 --> 00:02:38.720
 very important at sony because there 

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:41.359
 an entire ecosystem available a 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:42.980
 ecosystem of accessories we also 

00:02:41.359 --> 00:02:43.880
 an atrium so a headset a 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:45.950
 little more than an ear is besides 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:48.560
 it's a combined mini that will be sold 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:51.590
 119 euros which allows to receive a 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:54.139
 call rejected a call see his smsc 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:56.150
 for those who do not want to wear the 

00:02:54.139 --> 00:02:58.630
 phone the fable is to the ear 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:01.310
 necessarily with such a size was 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:03.019
 that's all an ecosystem nfc level 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:05.209
 configuration really it's heavy 

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:07.819
 was 16 giga storage is 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:10.130
 expandable via the traditional slot 

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:12.829
 microsd that accepts cards up 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:15.019
 64 gigas there is no problem level 

00:03:12.829 --> 00:03:16.430
 of the configuration on the other hand we get 

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:18.620
 may ask some level questions 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:20.750
 autonomy with such a thickness and a 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:23.090
 such sony weight could only integrate one 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:25.099
 Battery 3000 miles and loses 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:26.720
 that's really going to be the most 

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:27.580
 important to watch as well as with a 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:29.860
 such screen 

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:33.520
 we risk soliciting a lot the 

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:37.240
 mobile back we have an exmor sensor of 8 

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:39.580
 megapixel 2 mega in android facade 

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:41.320
 4.2.2 this is for bones 

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:43.180
 we obviously find the small 

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:45.220
 sony overlay which is very light 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:48.400
 we basically find widgets 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:50.770
 the mini widgets present on on the 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:53.860
 taskbar the multitasking bar 

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:56.650
 earlier so here's to order the 

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:59.410
 timer but also the application notes 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:01.030
 note that we will always have 

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:02.890
 part software a keyboard that is 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:05.290
 shifted to make a seizure 

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:09.340
 with one hand then the xperia z was 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:10.180
 ip57 stands tall to ultra z and ip him 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:12.370
 58 

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:14.290
 basically they were screaming 58 that means a 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:17.590
 immersion at 1 meter 50 

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:19.540
 for 30 minutes actually this is it 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:22.360
 a norm in reality could even 

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:23.950
 go down to 4 meters 5 m remaining 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:25.750
 obviously less time so 

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:26.200
 water resistance resistance to 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:28.570
 dust 

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:31.690
 this is always the logic of products 

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:35.200
 usable by all we finish with the 

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:37.419
 price and availability of the 11th of ultra 

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:41.260
 will be available at the beginning of the current season 

00:04:37.419 --> 00:04:41.950
 September the price it will hurt 729 

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:43.810
 euros 

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:45.900
 it's alexandre billault for cnet 

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:48.460
