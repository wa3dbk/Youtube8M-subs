00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.720
 I present you a country maple. 

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:07.920
 It is a tree that has a few years already grown in soil and pot. 

00:00:08.199 --> 00:00:12.359
 It has a beautiful structure, a beautiful branching as you can see 

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:17.420
 It is a tree that has grown with much more sun on this side than on this side, 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.640
 which makes the leaves turn slightly 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.180
 We will begin to look at his tree, facing him 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:31.480
 and we will try to determine all the stems that have grown and that we will be able to eliminate. 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.320
 We start working the tree on the low branches, and we go back slowly, 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:39.940
 which will allow to work gradually, 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:41.940
 and go back on his tree while still working on the scale. 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.580
 What we will try to do is produce fine branching 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:50.220
 The tree is already well advanced, it already looks like a bonsai, 

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:52.810
 he is, we will say 

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:55.810
 on a proper scale, compared to his pot, 

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:58.450
 in pottery, it's going pretty well. 

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:01.010
 On the other hand, he tends to push very hard, 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:04.210
 and to make between very long knots, and us, 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:07.250
 we want to avoid this, to branch the tree 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:09.020
 and try to give an appearance 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:12.020
 much more compact of this tree. 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:14.380
 So, simply, we're going to cut down the big stems, 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:17.390
 the between nodes too long. 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:19.390
 Everything that pushes up is eliminated, 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:25.360
 and everything that pushes down, we also eliminate. 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.820
 Always work in front of your tree, 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:30.820
 to see what we do. 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:33.880
 We're not going to look behind to cut a branch, 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:36.520
 we turn his tray, 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:38.520
 and so we turn his tree 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:41.890
 and we always have the silhouette of the tree. So you have to understand 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:45.540
 we work on one side, the front, 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.620
 but that finally we must give volume to the tree and therefore, 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.680
 we will homogenize the work front and back. 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:00.160
 What we are trying to do too, is that the branches must be tapered. 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:04.920
 The appearance of the branch must be more and more fine and branched. 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.660
 In principle you do not tear any branch, 

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:10.060
 even departures on the trunk, 

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:13.240
 always prefer to cut with scissors. 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.040
 This tree has a dominant apical, 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:34.500
 he tends to push up. 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.460
 So you have several possibilities each time, 

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:42.200
 many choices, and the goal is still to leave him his natural port. 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:45.180
 We can see that this head, 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:48.180
 is going over the silhouette of the tree, 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:51.240
 I decided to eliminate it and start over something 

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:54.000
 much shorter, behind. 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.760
 So, take the concave pliers, 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.600
 and we come looking for ... so I will not cut too short, 

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:04.380
 because there will surely be a withdrawal of sap. 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.980
 It's a job that we do, about every six months to a year. 

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:12.240
 It really depends on the growth rate of your tree, simply. 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:15.760
 We do not forget to take a little bit of mastic (putty for graft) 

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:19.020
 and we will cover the cuts we made. 

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:22.360
 Application of the sealant with the finger, 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:26.540
 Do not forget to weed your tree, 

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:31.080
 this is a regular job that we can do when we water for example. 

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:35.400
 These herbs will take food from the tree, 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.400
 that is the fertilizer that you will bring. 

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:40.080
 They will take water too, 

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:45.080
 you take the little fork folded, you scratch a little on the surface, 

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:47.580
 and we find the roots (herbs) quite easily. 

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:50.000
 I also remove some surface roots (from the tree), 

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:52.580
 which are unsightly. 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:03:59.480
 We clean! 

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:07.600
 And now, the tree is ready to go back in culture, for a few months ... 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:13.780
 Do not forget to take photos of your tree before and after work, 

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:19.200
 This will allow you to see the progress of your tree and your work. 

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:23.440
 See you soon, goodbye!
