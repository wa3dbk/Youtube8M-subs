00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
here so what we're doing though is we

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.380 
here so what we're doing though is we
are<00:00:48.809> identifying<00:00:49.610> that<00:00:50.610> it's<00:00:50.879> definitely<00:00:51.329> not

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
are identifying that it's definitely not

the<00:00:51.449> vehicle<00:00:51.750> I<00:00:52.170> think<00:00:52.379> that's<00:00:52.500> very<00:00:52.590> strong

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
the vehicle I think that's very strong

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.010 
the vehicle I think that's very strong
because<00:00:53.820> we<00:00:53.940> didn't<00:00:54.270> hear<00:00:54.449> that<00:00:54.510> from<00:00:54.930> a

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
because we didn't hear that from a

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.779 
because we didn't hear that from a
couple<00:00:55.140> of<00:00:55.350> salespeople<00:00:55.680> here<00:00:55.890> before<00:00:56.280> and<00:00:56.670> a

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
couple of salespeople here before and a

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.790 
couple of salespeople here before and a
lot<00:00:57.030> of<00:00:57.059> salespeople<00:00:57.420> omit<00:00:58.199> that<00:00:58.410> and<00:00:58.649> that's

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
lot of salespeople omit that and that's

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.950 
lot of salespeople omit that and that's
a<00:00:59.010> key<00:00:59.309> thing<00:00:59.640> right<00:00:59.910> there's<00:01:00.210> identified

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
a key thing right there's identified

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.410 
a key thing right there's identified
it's<00:01:01.440> not<00:01:01.739> the<00:01:01.949> car<00:01:02.250> is<00:01:02.460> it<00:01:02.699> remember<00:01:03.030> the<00:01:03.149> stat

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
it's not the car is it remember the stat

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.370 
it's not the car is it remember the stat
from<00:01:03.570> nata<00:01:04.110> is<00:01:04.439> that<00:01:05.129> what<00:01:05.430> the<00:01:06.420> number<00:01:06.990> one

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
reason why people don't buy cars is

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:10.609 
reason why people don't buy cars is
because<00:01:09.360> they're<00:01:09.510> landed<00:01:09.869> on<00:01:09.990> the<00:01:10.140> wrong<00:01:10.320> car

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
because they're landed on the wrong car
