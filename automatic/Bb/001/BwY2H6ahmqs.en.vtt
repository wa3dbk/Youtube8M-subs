behind<00:05:28.760> them<00:05:28.970> the<00:05:29.120> spawns<00:05:29.360> flips<00:05:29.720> flank

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:30.440 
behind them the spawns flips flank

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:32.110 
behind them the spawns flips flank
around<00:05:30.590> the<00:05:30.860> entire<00:05:31.130> map<00:05:31.370> if<00:05:31.550> it<00:05:31.700> takes<00:05:31.910> you<00:05:32.090> a

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:32.120 
around the entire map if it takes you a

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:34.630 
around the entire map if it takes you a
minute<00:05:32.360> to<00:05:32.780> flank<00:05:33.170> around<00:05:33.350> but<00:05:34.100> you<00:05:34.220> don't<00:05:34.430> die

minute to flank around but you don't die
it<00:05:35.000> is<00:05:35.210> well<00:05:35.480> worth<00:05:35.690> it<00:05:35.960> especially<00:05:36.050> if<00:05:36.530> it's

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:36.680 
it is well worth it especially if it's

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:38.800 
it is well worth it especially if it's
one<00:05:36.830> of<00:05:36.920> your<00:05:36.980> first<00:05:37.130> Moab's<00:05:37.550> it<00:05:37.700> is<00:05:37.790> very<00:05:38.210> well

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:38.810 
one of your first Moab's it is very well

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:41.500 
one of your first Moab's it is very well
worth<00:05:38.990> it<00:05:39.200> so<00:05:39.380> flanking<00:05:40.010> and<00:05:40.880> doing<00:05:41.240> all<00:05:41.360> that

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:41.510 
worth it so flanking and doing all that

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:44.410 
worth it so flanking and doing all that
stuff<00:05:41.780> is<00:05:42.020> is<00:05:42.260> great<00:05:42.950> now<00:05:43.850> the<00:05:43.910> other<00:05:44.270> thing

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:44.420 
stuff is is great now the other thing

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:46.840 
stuff is is great now the other thing
that<00:05:44.630> kind<00:05:45.200> of<00:05:45.260> takes<00:05:45.470> in<00:05:45.650> learning<00:05:46.460> I<00:05:46.580> guess

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:46.850 
that kind of takes in learning I guess

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:49.300 
that kind of takes in learning I guess
is<00:05:47.150> knowing<00:05:47.960> what<00:05:48.110> your<00:05:48.320> team<00:05:48.560> is<00:05:48.770> doing<00:05:48.980> and

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:14.350 
their strategy and all that stuff is you
can<00:06:12.890> kind<00:06:13.100> of<00:06:13.130> play<00:06:13.370> off<00:06:13.550> of<00:06:13.580> that<00:06:13.820> and<00:06:14.090> then

00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:14.360 
can kind of play off of that and then

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:16.120 
can kind of play off of that and then
kind<00:06:14.750> of<00:06:14.780> get<00:06:14.930> the<00:06:15.050> easy<00:06:15.200> kill<00:06:15.590> because<00:06:15.980> you

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:16.130 
kind of get the easy kill because you

00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:17.290 
kind of get the easy kill because you
know<00:06:16.370> they're<00:06:16.580> going<00:06:16.700> to<00:06:16.760> go<00:06:16.880> back<00:06:17.090> to<00:06:17.120> that

00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:17.300 
know they're going to go back to that
