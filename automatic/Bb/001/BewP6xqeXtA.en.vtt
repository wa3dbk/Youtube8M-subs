00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:25.320

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.330
 it's very funny because I'm going to be almost 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:30.929
 every day because I'll be fine 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:33.690

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:35.520

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.980

 at the book fair and then 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:49.199
 with emotions is the next thing 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:51.570
 what I want to share with you is that 

00:00:49.199 --> 00:00:53.339
 I've made some channel markers that 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.140
 no doubt I am very excited because they have 

00:00:53.339 --> 00:00:57.210
 stayed beautiful not when I had this 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.890
 idea of making bookmarks I saw many 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.440
 Poor markers and blocks and era 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:04.019
 like channel propaganda but I 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.270
 I wanted to do it more I do not know this peak and that 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.700
 embellish your book instead of being a 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:13.100
 propaganda for your book so if the 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.100
 I did and they are this 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:30.689
 with taste 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:30.689
 I love it 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:37.299
 and tonight I had to do is that 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:40.030
 I'm raffling this book love letter 

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:41.740
 to the dead that distribute that I 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:44.409
 I was taking to get around the entire base of 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:45.880
