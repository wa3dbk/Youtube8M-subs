achieve a different color your
chemically<00:01:33.080> altering<00:01:33.770> the<00:01:34.010> state<00:01:34.340> of<00:01:34.550> your

weakened in different ways so what's

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:43.540 
weakened in different ways so what's
going<00:01:41.510> to<00:01:41.570> happen<00:01:42.080> is<00:01:42.470> when<00:01:42.890> hair<00:01:43.280> dye<00:01:43.490> is

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:43.550 
going to happen is when hair dye is

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:46.210 
going to happen is when hair dye is
being<00:01:43.970> put<00:01:44.180> onto<00:01:44.450> your<00:01:44.660> hair<00:01:45.080> what's<00:01:45.680> going<00:01:46.010> on

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:48.200 
is that the hair is reaching deep inside

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:51.010 
is that the hair is reaching deep inside
the<00:01:48.440> hair<00:01:48.650> shaft<00:01:49.040> or<00:01:49.370> hair<00:01:49.550> follicle<00:01:50.120> and<00:01:50.270> it's
