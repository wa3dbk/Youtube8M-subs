 we put in a bowl with the butter and 

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:35.010

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:44.809
 on top we put the first layer of ice cream 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:46.940
 of chocolate that must be softened 

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:48.800
 to make it easier to distribute and over 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:50.989
 the cookies that we had that step 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:53.030

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:57.290

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:13.600
 boil in that moment we remove it and the 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:13.600
