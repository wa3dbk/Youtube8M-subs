00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
might have been an option yeah I'm

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:31.100 
might have been an option yeah I'm
pretty<00:02:28.110> sure<00:02:28.260> was<00:02:29.150> Whiteman<00:02:30.150> retiring<00:02:30.510> like

green lights again between the green

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:59.380 
green lights again between the green
lights<00:02:57.830> and<00:02:58.069> a<00:02:58.220> lot<00:02:58.400> of<00:02:58.430> a.m.<00:02:58.670> -<00:02:58.880> so<00:02:59.090> I<00:02:59.120> do<00:02:59.180> like

00:02:59.380 --> 00:02:59.390 
lights and a lot of a.m. - so I do like

lights and a lot of a.m. - so I do like
the<00:02:59.540> m2s<00:02:59.930> but<00:03:00.260> there<00:03:01.270> it's<00:03:02.270> kind<00:03:02.390> of<00:03:02.420> hard<00:03:02.600> to

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:02.660 
the m2s but there it's kind of hard to

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:04.300 
the m2s but there it's kind of hard to
find<00:03:02.810> any<00:03:02.989> good<00:03:03.200> ones<00:03:03.380> near<00:03:03.950> me

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:06.290 
so it's saying with green light these

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:09.100 
so it's saying with green light these
all<00:03:06.470> came<00:03:06.709> from<00:03:06.800> anybody<00:03:07.250> so<00:03:07.610> I<00:03:07.970> guess<00:03:08.720> I<00:03:08.870> can't

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:09.110 
all came from anybody so I guess I can't

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:12.040 
all came from anybody so I guess I can't
really<00:03:09.200> say<00:03:09.530> that<00:03:09.560> I<00:03:09.769> just<00:03:10.040> like<00:03:10.370> the<00:03:11.050> the

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:12.050 
really say that I just like the the

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:13.449 
really say that I just like the the
green<00:03:12.230> light<00:03:12.380> series<00:03:12.680> a<00:03:12.800> little<00:03:13.010> better<00:03:13.190> I

00:03:13.449 --> 00:03:13.459 
green light series a little better I

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:15.910 
green light series a little better I
just<00:03:13.580> think<00:03:13.850> a<00:03:14.000> little<00:03:14.180> bit<00:03:14.330> more<00:03:14.510> detail<00:03:14.930> tire

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:15.920 
just think a little bit more detail tire

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:18.370 
just think a little bit more detail tire
widths<00:03:16.400> and<00:03:16.519> all<00:03:16.640> that<00:03:16.850> or<00:03:17.120> a<00:03:17.150> little<00:03:17.360> better

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:18.380 
widths and all that or a little better

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:21.400 
widths and all that or a little better
plus<00:03:18.830> I<00:03:19.160> don't<00:03:20.120> like<00:03:20.299> a<00:03:20.330> lot<00:03:20.630> of<00:03:20.660> u2's<00:03:21.140> because

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:21.410 
plus I don't like a lot of u2's because

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:23.170 
plus I don't like a lot of u2's because
the<00:03:21.680> doors<00:03:21.920> open<00:03:22.400> all<00:03:22.519> that<00:03:22.549> you<00:03:22.850> can<00:03:23.000> really

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:23.180

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:32.320 
really give them right and you could
just<00:03:30.680> tell<00:03:30.920> well<00:03:31.220> the<00:03:31.340> door<00:03:31.489> open<00:03:31.880> citizen
