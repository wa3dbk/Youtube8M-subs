00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
field and I was actually wondering if

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:40.700 
field and I was actually wondering if
you're<00:00:39.629> even<00:00:39.780> going<00:00:39.989> to<00:00:40.079> get<00:00:40.230> a<00:00:40.290> demo<00:00:40.500> this

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
try this new physics engine and get a

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.229 
try this new physics engine and get a
new<00:00:53.010> feel<00:00:53.219> for<00:00:53.460> the<00:00:53.550> game<00:00:53.730> I<00:00:53.789> think<00:00:54.030> it's<00:00:54.149> going

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
new feel for the game I think it's going

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.029 
new feel for the game I think it's going
to<00:00:54.329> be<00:00:54.510> a<00:00:54.539> little<00:00:54.780> bit<00:00:54.960> different<00:00:55.410> I<00:00:55.559> just<00:00:55.890> want

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
to be a little bit different I just want

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:57.560 
to be a little bit different I just want
to<00:00:56.100> see<00:00:56.250> how<00:00:56.399> much<00:00:56.730> I<00:00:56.969> just<00:00:57.300> want<00:00:57.420> to<00:00:57.480> see<00:00:57.539> the

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
to see how much I just want to see the

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.330 
to see how much I just want to see the
way<00:00:57.690> everything<00:00:58.079> feels<00:00:58.410> and<00:00:58.739> I<00:00:58.770> hope<00:00:58.980> that<00:00:59.010> in

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
way everything feels and I hope that in

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.330 
way everything feels and I hope that in
this<00:00:59.489> demo<00:00:59.760> unlike<00:01:00.359> the<00:01:00.390> NCAA<00:01:01.170> 13<00:01:01.199> demo<00:01:01.859> you

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
this demo unlike the NCAA 13 demo you

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.189 
this demo unlike the NCAA 13 demo you
can<00:01:02.370> change<00:01:02.879> difficulty<00:01:03.570> because<00:01:03.660> NC<00:01:04.080> go

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
can change difficulty because NC go

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.230 
can change difficulty because NC go
blaze<00:01:04.439> was<00:01:04.650> too<00:01:04.860> easy<00:01:05.100> I<00:01:05.309> thought<00:01:05.700> and<00:01:05.970> it

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
blaze was too easy I thought and it

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:07.730 
blaze was too easy I thought and it
wasn't<00:01:06.510> really<00:01:06.600> a<00:01:06.750> good<00:01:06.960> way<00:01:07.110> to<00:01:07.140> get<00:01:07.409> a<00:01:07.439> feel

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
wasn't really a good way to get a feel

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.440 
wasn't really a good way to get a feel
for<00:01:07.950> the<00:01:08.040> new<00:01:08.220> read<00:01:08.460> and<00:01:08.580> react<00:01:08.820> defensive<00:01:09.299> AI

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
for the new read and react defensive AI

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.539 
for the new read and react defensive AI
system<00:01:10.140> and<00:01:10.290> to<00:01:10.619> feel<00:01:10.830> that<00:01:10.860> game<00:01:11.130> out<00:01:11.310> the<00:01:11.430> way

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
system and to feel that game out the way

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:12.710 
system and to feel that game out the way
I<00:01:11.580> would<00:01:11.729> have<00:01:11.850> liked<00:01:12.060> to<00:01:12.180> had<00:01:12.299> to<00:01:12.390> wait<00:01:12.510> for

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
I would have liked to had to wait for

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.090 
I would have liked to had to wait for
the<00:01:12.750> actual<00:01:13.140> game<00:01:13.170> that<00:01:13.439> come<00:01:13.590> out<00:01:13.710> to<00:01:13.860> really

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
the actual game that come out to really

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.920 
the actual game that come out to really
get<00:01:14.310> a<00:01:14.549> solid<00:01:14.909> opinion<00:01:15.119> on<00:01:15.479> it<00:01:15.600> and<00:01:15.750> how<00:01:15.869> the

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
get a solid opinion on it and how the

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.109 
get a solid opinion on it and how the
game<00:01:16.229> was<00:01:16.350> actually<00:01:16.680> playing<00:01:16.890> so<00:01:17.610> hopefully

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
game was actually playing so hopefully

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:19.580 
game was actually playing so hopefully

this series has seen in a generation so

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.100 
this series has seen in a generation so
I<00:01:41.460> all<00:01:41.820> they<00:01:41.939> live<00:01:42.240> up<00:01:42.420> to<00:01:42.570> that<00:01:42.600> statement

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
I all they live up to that statement

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:44.960 
I all they live up to that statement
right<00:01:43.350> there<00:01:43.409> and<00:01:43.770> make<00:01:43.950> madden<00:01:44.250> 13<00:01:44.280> the<00:01:44.759> best

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
right there and make madden 13 the best

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.030 
right there and make madden 13 the best
game<00:01:45.119> we<00:01:45.149> can<00:01:45.329> possibly<00:01:45.750> be<00:01:45.960> I<00:01:46.170> think<00:01:46.710> Madden

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
game we can possibly be I think Madden

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.020 
game we can possibly be I think Madden
12<00:01:47.250> was<00:01:47.399> a<00:01:47.460> step<00:01:47.670> in<00:01:47.790> the<00:01:47.820> right<00:01:47.970> direction

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
12 was a step in the right direction

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.389 
12 was a step in the right direction
especially<00:01:48.600> compared<00:01:49.229> to<00:01:49.320> madden<00:01:49.619> 11<00:01:49.649> and<00:01:50.070> so

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
especially compared to madden 11 and so

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:51.740 
especially compared to madden 11 and so
i<00:01:50.430> hope<00:01:50.520> to<00:01:50.640> see<00:01:50.700> that<00:01:50.880> continuing<00:01:51.360> madden<00:01:51.720> 13

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
i hope to see that continuing madden 13

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.719 
i hope to see that continuing madden 13
and<00:01:52.409> my<00:01:52.740> main<00:01:52.950> concern<00:01:53.310> right<00:01:53.340> now<00:01:53.460> is<00:01:53.579> just

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
and my main concern right now is just

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.550 
and my main concern right now is just
seeing<00:01:54.060> how<00:01:54.210> the<00:01:54.270> gameplay<00:01:54.810> plays<00:01:55.110> now<00:01:55.380> it's

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
seeing how the gameplay plays now it's

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.170 
seeing how the gameplay plays now it's
different<00:01:55.979> from<00:01:56.070> madden<00:01:56.399> 12<00:01:56.640> and<00:01:56.880> how<00:01:56.969> it's

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
different from madden 12 and how it's

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:58.760 
different from madden 12 and how it's
going<00:01:57.360> to<00:01:57.540> be<00:01:57.659> better<00:01:57.899> and<00:01:58.140> so<00:01:58.560> I'm<00:01:58.649> really

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
going to be better and so I'm really

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.319 
going to be better and so I'm really
looking<00:01:58.890> forward<00:01:59.100> to<00:01:59.369> the<00:01:59.460> 14th<00:01:59.939> and<00:02:00.180> if<00:02:00.240> you
