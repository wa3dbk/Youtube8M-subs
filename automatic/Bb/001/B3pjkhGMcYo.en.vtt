00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:25.820 
new to that and we just freakin slapped

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:29.950 
new to that and we just freakin slapped
his<00:05:26.150> design<00:05:26.570> down<00:05:27.500> and<00:05:27.979> called<00:05:28.640> it<00:05:28.880> ours<00:05:29.120> you

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:29.960 
his design down and called it ours you

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:32.530 
his design down and called it ours you
know<00:05:30.080> it's<00:05:30.320> like<00:05:30.470> no<00:05:30.650> no<00:05:30.950> this<00:05:31.490> is<00:05:31.790> different<00:05:31.820> I

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:32.540 
know it's like no no this is different I

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:34.600 
know it's like no no this is different I
mean<00:05:32.660> there's<00:05:32.870> just<00:05:32.960> like<00:05:33.350> so<00:05:33.680> very<00:05:34.160> minor

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:34.610 
mean there's just like so very minor

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:36.580 
mean there's just like so very minor
things<00:05:35.090> that<00:05:35.330> are<00:05:35.450> different<00:05:35.750> and<00:05:36.110> I<00:05:36.169> will<00:05:36.380> say

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:36.590 
things that are different and I will say

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:37.870 
things that are different and I will say
that<00:05:36.830> if<00:05:36.950> you<00:05:37.039> have<00:05:37.220> trouble<00:05:37.430> with<00:05:37.700> our

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:37.880 
that if you have trouble with our

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:40.030 
that if you have trouble with our
tutorial<00:05:38.680> that

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:40.040 
tutorial that

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:41.770 
tutorial that
go<00:05:40.160> check<00:05:40.400> out<00:05:40.580> his<00:05:40.760> if<00:05:41.000> you<00:05:41.120> are<00:05:41.270> interested

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:41.780 
go check out his if you are interested

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:43.990 
go check out his if you are interested
because<00:05:42.470> he<00:05:43.040> did<00:05:43.220> build<00:05:43.400> it<00:05:43.490> block<00:05:43.670> by<00:05:43.850> block

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:44.000 
because he did build it block by block

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:45.640 
because he did build it block by block
the<00:05:44.210> only<00:05:44.300> reason<00:05:44.750> why<00:05:44.900> I<00:05:44.960> wanted<00:05:45.470> to<00:05:45.530> make

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:45.650 
the only reason why I wanted to make

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:47.170 
the only reason why I wanted to make
this<00:05:45.830> tutorial<00:05:46.280> of<00:05:46.400> it<00:05:46.550> you<00:05:46.820> know<00:05:46.910> even<00:05:47.120> though

00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:47.180 
this tutorial of it you know even though

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:47.980 
this tutorial of it you know even though
he<00:05:47.210> has<00:05:47.510> one

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:47.990 
he has one

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:50.680 
he has one
he's<00:05:48.770> just<00:05:49.040> to<00:05:49.250> condense<00:05:50.000> it<00:05:50.180> down<00:05:50.330> make<00:05:50.570> it

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:50.690 
he's just to condense it down make it

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:52.300 
he's just to condense it down make it
quicker<00:05:50.930> and<00:05:51.050> faster<00:05:51.290> for<00:05:51.650> people<00:05:52.010> who<00:05:52.130> want

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:52.310 
quicker and faster for people who want

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:55.090 
quicker and faster for people who want
to<00:05:52.430> just<00:05:52.610> make<00:05:52.820> it<00:05:52.970> on<00:05:53.090> the<00:05:53.180> fly<00:05:53.390> his<00:05:53.990> is<00:05:54.260> like<00:05:54.530> I

00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:55.100 
to just make it on the fly his is like I

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:57.190 
to just make it on the fly his is like I
think<00:05:55.580> block<00:05:55.790> by<00:05:56.000> I<00:05:56.030> actually<00:05:56.690> have<00:05:57.020> not

00:05:57.190 --> 00:05:57.200 
think block by I actually have not

00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:58.840 
think block by I actually have not
watched<00:05:57.530> I<00:05:57.740> just<00:05:57.980> know<00:05:58.100> that<00:05:58.220> he<00:05:58.340> has<00:05:58.550> those

00:05:58.840 --> 00:05:58.850 
watched I just know that he has those

00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:00.760 
watched I just know that he has those
videos<00:05:59.240> I<00:05:59.450> think<00:05:59.780> he<00:06:00.050> builds<00:06:00.290> it<00:06:00.350> block<00:06:00.590> by

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:00.770 
videos I think he builds it block by

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:02.560 
videos I think he builds it block by
block<00:06:00.920> and<00:06:01.520> he<00:06:01.610> has<00:06:01.700> like<00:06:01.880> maybe<00:06:02.060> five<00:06:02.360> or<00:06:02.390> six

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:02.570 
block and he has like maybe five or six

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:04.810 
block and he has like maybe five or six
videos<00:06:03.020> that<00:06:03.200> maybe<00:06:03.410> are<00:06:03.680> half-hour<00:06:04.250> hour

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:04.820 
videos that maybe are half-hour hour

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:07.000 
videos that maybe are half-hour hour
long<00:06:05.210> and<00:06:05.450> yeah<00:06:06.380> they're<00:06:06.590> very<00:06:06.620> time

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:07.010 
long and yeah they're very time

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:08.290 
long and yeah they're very time
consuming<00:06:07.040> and<00:06:07.550> I<00:06:07.580> wanted<00:06:07.820> to<00:06:07.880> condense<00:06:08.120> all

00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:08.300 
consuming and I wanted to condense all

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:10.000 
consuming and I wanted to condense all
that<00:06:08.420> down<00:06:08.540> into<00:06:08.780> one<00:06:08.960> video<00:06:09.140> to<00:06:09.710> make<00:06:09.830> it

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:10.010 
that down into one video to make it

00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:12.820 
that down into one video to make it
pretty<00:06:10.280> simple<00:06:10.520> and<00:06:10.670> easy<00:06:10.960> so<00:06:11.960> yeah<00:06:12.590> if<00:06:12.740> you

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:12.830

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:15.110 
want to check out that tutorial it's in

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:16.720 
want to check out that tutorial it's in
a<00:06:15.260> link<00:06:15.620> will<00:06:15.770> be<00:06:15.890> in<00:06:15.920> the<00:06:16.130> description<00:06:16.640> and

a link will be in the description and

00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:19.150 
a link will be in the description and
probably<00:06:16.820> at<00:06:17.060> than<00:06:17.210> in<00:06:17.330> this<00:06:17.450> video<00:06:17.750> I'm<00:06:18.530> to<00:06:19.070> go

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:19.160 
probably at than in this video I'm to go

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:19.980 
probably at than in this video I'm to go
check<00:06:19.370> that<00:06:19.400> out

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:19.990 
check that out

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:23.290 
check that out
so<00:06:20.990> yeah<00:06:21.860> but<00:06:22.370> I<00:06:22.400> just<00:06:22.640> want<00:06:23.000> to<00:06:23.060> put<00:06:23.180> all

00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:23.300 
so yeah but I just want to put all

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:25.980 
so yeah but I just want to put all
controversy<00:06:24.020> aside<00:06:24.320> this<00:06:24.620> is<00:06:24.680> our<00:06:25.040> own<00:06:25.340> design

00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:25.990 
controversy aside this is our own design

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:28.240 
controversy aside this is our own design
there<00:06:26.990> are<00:06:27.110> things<00:06:27.410> that<00:06:27.500> are<00:06:27.650> very<00:06:27.950> similar

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:28.250 
there are things that are very similar

00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:30.190 
there are things that are very similar
but<00:06:28.640> you<00:06:29.120> know<00:06:29.240> it's<00:06:29.570> like<00:06:29.750> when<00:06:29.900> it's<00:06:30.020> done

00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:30.200 
but you know it's like when it's done

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:32.230 
but you know it's like when it's done
right<00:06:30.380> it's<00:06:30.710> done<00:06:31.070> right<00:06:31.310> you<00:06:31.670> know<00:06:31.790> he<00:06:32.090> had<00:06:32.180> a

00:06:32.230 --> 00:06:32.240 
right it's done right you know he had a

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:33.940 
right it's done right you know he had a
really<00:06:32.510> good<00:06:32.630> eye<00:06:32.720> and<00:06:33.050> he<00:06:33.530> designed

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:33.950 
really good eye and he designed

00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:37.120 
really good eye and he designed
it<00:06:34.070> like<00:06:34.190> to<00:06:34.370> a<00:06:34.400> key<00:06:34.670> and<00:06:34.940> I<00:06:35.780> really<00:06:36.440> can't<00:06:36.830> say

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:37.130 
it like to a key and I really can't say

00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:38.800 
it like to a key and I really can't say
much<00:06:37.310> different<00:06:37.730> like<00:06:37.940> we'd<00:06:38.180> spent<00:06:38.630> time

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:38.810 
much different like we'd spent time

00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:40.450 
much different like we'd spent time
designing<00:06:39.140> this<00:06:39.260> too<00:06:39.470> and<00:06:39.710> spent<00:06:40.040> time<00:06:40.280> you

00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:40.460 
designing this too and spent time you

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:42.310 
designing this too and spent time you
know<00:06:40.520> looking<00:06:41.360> at<00:06:41.480> the<00:06:41.570> differences<00:06:42.050> and

00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:42.320 
know looking at the differences and

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:43.960 
know looking at the differences and
seeing<00:06:42.650> if<00:06:42.830> we<00:06:43.160> could<00:06:43.490> possibly<00:06:43.640> make<00:06:43.910> it

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:43.970 
seeing if we could possibly make it

00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:45.220 
seeing if we could possibly make it
different<00:06:44.330> but<00:06:44.480> there<00:06:44.630> just<00:06:44.780> wasn't<00:06:44.870> anything

00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:45.230 
different but there just wasn't anything

00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:46.930 
different but there just wasn't anything
different<00:06:45.590> it's<00:06:45.740> exactly<00:06:46.160> off<00:06:46.340> with<00:06:46.490> model<00:06:46.790> of

00:06:46.930 --> 00:06:46.940 
different it's exactly off with model of

00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:48.340 
different it's exactly off with model of
the<00:06:47.060> inner<00:06:47.180> dragon<00:06:47.420> and<00:06:47.630> it's<00:06:47.750> freaking

00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:48.350 
the inner dragon and it's freaking

00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:51.610 
the inner dragon and it's freaking
phenomenal<00:06:48.550> so<00:06:49.550> yeah<00:06:50.150> I<00:06:50.510> would<00:06:51.080> probably<00:06:51.110> say

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:51.620 
phenomenal so yeah I would probably say

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:52.720 
phenomenal so yeah I would probably say
that's<00:06:51.800> pretty<00:06:52.040> impressive<00:06:52.400> to<00:06:52.640> add

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:52.730 
that's pretty impressive to add

00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:55.000 
that's pretty impressive to add
something<00:06:53.030> like<00:06:53.150> this<00:06:53.270> to<00:06:53.420> your<00:06:53.540> world<00:06:53.860> it<00:06:54.860> is

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:55.010 
something like this to your world it is

00:06:55.010 --> 00:06:58.000 
something like this to your world it is
very<00:06:55.220> big<00:06:55.940> and<00:06:56.150> I<00:06:56.390> will<00:06:56.630> warn<00:06:56.930> you<00:06:57.020> that<00:06:57.320> taking
