hour 42 but turn on and the problem is

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:52.290 
hour 42 but turn on and the problem is
now<00:00:50.679> though<00:00:50.949> that<00:00:51.129> the<00:00:51.249> lab<00:00:51.460> was<00:00:51.760> staying<00:00:52.059> on

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:52.300 
now though that the lab was staying on

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:54.959 
now though that the lab was staying on
constantly<00:00:53.190> indicating<00:00:54.190> the<00:00:54.309> presence<00:00:54.460> of<00:00:54.850> a

constantly indicating the presence of a
continuous<00:00:55.659> overload<00:00:56.699> so<00:00:57.699> I<00:00:57.729> got<00:00:58.149> the<00:00:58.300> hv

00:00:58.739 --> 00:00:58.749 
continuous overload so I got the hv

00:00:58.749 --> 00:01:03.090 
continuous overload so I got the hv

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:03.100 
transformer out of the chassis and I put

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:07.620 
transformer out of the chassis and I put
it<00:01:03.219> on<00:01:03.309> another<00:01:03.609> series<00:01:04.059> lamb<00:01:05.670> and<00:01:06.670> I<00:01:07.240> checked

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:07.630 
it on another series lamb and I checked

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:09.929 
it on another series lamb and I checked
it<00:01:07.840> here<00:01:08.170> and<00:01:08.290> it<00:01:08.350> looks<00:01:08.619> like<00:01:08.770> it's<00:01:08.950> okay<00:01:09.640> or

00:01:09.929 --> 00:01:09.939 
it here and it looks like it's okay or

00:01:09.939 --> 00:01:12.480 
it here and it looks like it's okay or
not<00:01:09.969> indicating<00:01:10.719> any<00:01:10.869> shorts<00:01:11.530> this

careful with what you're doing have to
take<00:01:24.520> extreme<00:01:24.670> caution<00:01:25.210> I'm<00:01:25.600> working<00:01:25.960> on

00:01:26.039 --> 00:01:26.049 
take extreme caution I'm working on

00:01:26.049 --> 00:01:31.020 
take extreme caution I'm working on
things<00:01:26.259> like<00:01:26.530> this<00:01:26.950> but<00:01:28.380> I<00:01:29.380> measured<00:01:30.219> the<00:01:30.490> load

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:31.030 
things like this but I measured the load

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:32.940 
things like this but I measured the load
of<00:01:31.210> all<00:01:31.359> this<00:01:31.570> also<00:01:31.810> has<00:01:31.990> a<00:01:32.020> low<00:01:32.289> voltage<00:01:32.439> bias

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:32.950 
of all this also has a low voltage bias

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:36.240 
of all this also has a low voltage bias
winding<00:01:33.609> and<00:01:33.729> I<00:01:33.820> measured<00:01:34.240> about<00:01:34.859> 300<00:01:35.859> volts

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:36.250 
winding and I measured about 300 volts

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:38.999 
winding and I measured about 300 volts
on<00:01:36.399> that<00:01:36.609> it<00:01:36.820> provides<00:01:37.149> the<00:01:37.390> bias<00:01:37.659> voltage<00:01:38.500> and

00:01:38.999 --> 00:01:39.009 
on that it provides the bias voltage and

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:41.819 
on that it provides the bias voltage and
also<00:01:39.579> the<00:01:40.000> low<00:01:40.659> voltage<00:01:40.689> supply<00:01:41.560> for<00:01:41.799> the

00:01:41.819 --> 00:01:41.829 
also the low voltage supply for the

00:01:41.829 --> 00:01:46.200 
also the low voltage supply for the
other<00:01:42.039> tubes<00:01:43.530> so<00:01:44.530> I'm<00:01:44.799> going<00:01:45.009> to<00:01:45.100> test<00:01:45.850> it<00:01:46.060> out

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:46.210 
other tubes so I'm going to test it out

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:49.770 
other tubes so I'm going to test it out
here<00:01:47.399> I've<00:01:48.399> got<00:01:48.640> it<00:01:48.789> hooked<00:01:48.939> up<00:01:49.179> with<00:01:49.390> a<00:01:49.420> short

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:49.780

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:57.300 
and plug it in about three hundred and

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:59.840 
and plug it in about three hundred and
twenty<00:01:57.660> seven<00:01:58.050> volts<00:01:58.290> now<00:01:59.160> this<00:01:59.340> is<00:01:59.400> across

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
twenty seven volts now this is across

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:05.450 
twenty seven volts now this is across
the<00:02:00.120> center<00:02:00.480> cap<00:02:01.940> it<00:02:02.940> really<00:02:03.240> has<00:02:04.160> 600<00:02:05.160> volts

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
the center cap it really has 600 volts

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.420 
the center cap it really has 600 volts
total<00:02:05.850> on<00:02:05.940> that<00:02:06.150> winding<00:02:06.800> one<00:02:07.800> thing<00:02:08.009> I<00:02:08.160> see

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:08.430 
total on that winding one thing I see

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:11.870 
total on that winding one thing I see
here<00:02:08.759> though<00:02:09.000> is<00:02:09.330> some<00:02:09.570> carbonized<00:02:10.550> stuff<00:02:11.550> if

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:11.880 
here though is some carbonized stuff if

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:14.750 
here though is some carbonized stuff if
you<00:02:12.030> look<00:02:12.240> here<00:02:12.690> see<00:02:13.500> some<00:02:13.740> carbon<00:02:14.250> tracking

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
you look here see some carbon tracking

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:18.170 
you look here see some carbon tracking
on<00:02:14.940> there<00:02:15.440> it<00:02:16.440> may<00:02:16.770> not<00:02:17.010> be<00:02:17.070> till<00:02:17.700> the<00:02:17.850> device

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
on there it may not be till the device

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.270 
on there it may not be till the device
is<00:02:18.390> put<00:02:18.660> under<00:02:18.780> load<00:02:19.170> that<00:02:19.590> the<00:02:19.710> problems

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
is put under load that the problems

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:25.610 
is put under load that the problems
appear<00:02:21.000> but<00:02:21.900> at<00:02:22.050> least<00:02:22.290> without<00:02:22.650> a<00:02:22.860> load<00:02:24.620> it

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
appear but at least without a load it

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.620 
appear but at least without a load it
doesn't<00:02:26.070> look<00:02:26.310> like<00:02:26.700> we're<00:02:27.209> getting<00:02:27.330> any

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:27.630 
doesn't look like we're getting any

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:29.990 
doesn't look like we're getting any
short<00:02:28.110> so<00:02:28.380> I've<00:02:28.530> got<00:02:28.709> another<00:02:28.950> transformer<00:02:29.640> in

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
short so I've got another transformer in

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.110 
short so I've got another transformer in
here<00:02:30.680> that<00:02:31.680> may<00:02:31.890> be<00:02:31.920> suspect<00:02:32.700> we'll<00:02:32.850> just<00:02:33.000> have

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
here that may be suspect we'll just have

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.510 
here that may be suspect we'll just have
to<00:02:33.240> check<00:02:33.450> it<00:02:33.630> out<00:02:33.780> too<00:02:34.080> but<00:02:34.920> this<00:02:35.040> is<00:02:35.250> a<00:02:35.280> good

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:35.520 
to check it out too but this is a good

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:36.949 
to check it out too but this is a good
sign<00:02:35.790> because<00:02:35.910> this<00:02:36.150> transformer<00:02:36.750> I<00:02:36.780> think

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:36.959 
sign because this transformer I think

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:38.240 
sign because this transformer I think
would<00:02:37.050> just<00:02:37.200> be<00:02:37.320> about<00:02:37.500> impossible<00:02:37.890> to

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
would just be about impossible to

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:42.830 
would just be about impossible to
