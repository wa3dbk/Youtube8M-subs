that's a good question

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:00.420 
that's a good question
I<00:02:57.970> just<00:02:58.300> think<00:02:58.480> that<00:02:58.600> they<00:02:58.840> are<00:02:58.870> a<00:02:59.500> came<00:03:00.100> out<00:03:00.310> on

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:00.430 
I just think that they are a came out on

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:05.310 
I just think that they are a came out on
fire<00:03:00.460> we<00:03:01.420> came<00:03:01.600> out<00:03:01.780> of<00:03:01.900> your<00:03:02.020> sluggish<00:03:04.320> but

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:05.320 
fire we came out of your sluggish but

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:07.550 
fire we came out of your sluggish but
every<00:03:06.280> game<00:03:06.430> is<00:03:06.580> not<00:03:06.760> going<00:03:06.910> to<00:03:06.970> be<00:03:07.090> perfect

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 
every game is not going to be perfect

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:09.870 
every game is not going to be perfect
I'm<00:03:08.560> going<00:03:08.740> to<00:03:08.830> have<00:03:08.980> those<00:03:09.130> games<00:03:09.430> where<00:03:09.670> we

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:09.880 
I'm going to have those games where we

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:11.400 
I'm going to have those games where we
miss<00:03:10.060> a<00:03:10.090> lot<00:03:10.300> of<00:03:10.360> shots<00:03:10.630> we<00:03:10.840> can't<00:03:11.050> handle<00:03:11.290> the

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:11.410 
miss a lot of shots we can't handle the

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:14.720

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:20.380 
which is still got to try to find a way

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:23.160 
which is still got to try to find a way
to<00:03:20.440> win<00:03:20.650> that's<00:03:21.370> what<00:03:21.490> we<00:03:21.550> did<00:03:21.700> tonight<00:03:22.170> first

free<00:03:27.340> throws<00:03:27.550> everything<00:03:27.850> seemed<00:03:28.420> like<00:03:28.450> it

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:28.630 
free throws everything seemed like it

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:31.980 
free throws everything seemed like it
was<00:03:28.900> just<00:03:28.990> all<00:03:29.200> bad<00:03:29.440> but<00:03:30.030> in<00:03:31.030> second<00:03:31.390> half<00:03:31.570> we

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:31.990 
was just all bad but in second half we

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:33.810 
was just all bad but in second half we
just<00:03:32.200> stayed<00:03:32.410> together<00:03:32.590> stay<00:03:33.130> focused<00:03:33.640> and

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:33.820 
just stayed together stay focused and

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:36.780 
just stayed together stay focused and
then<00:03:34.510> we<00:03:34.600> got<00:03:34.750> a<00:03:34.780> booth<00:03:35.160> because<00:03:36.160> the

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:36.790 
then we got a booth because the

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:38.640 
then we got a booth because the
rebounding<00:03:37.240> differentially<00:03:37.810> really<00:03:38.200> changed

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:38.650 
rebounding differentially really changed

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:39.960

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:41.410 
what was the catalyst for just turning

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:45.600 
what was the catalyst for just turning
around<00:03:41.530> like<00:03:41.860> y'all<00:03:42.040> did<00:03:42.190> oh<00:03:43.380> well<00:03:44.400> we<00:03:45.400> just

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:45.610

we thought it we had our game box down

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:52.020 
we thought it we had our game box down
and<00:03:50.950> then<00:03:51.040> we<00:03:51.130> let<00:03:51.340> go<00:03:51.370> at<00:03:51.670> the<00:03:51.700> end

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:52.030 
and then we let go at the end

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:53.520 
and then we let go at the end
investigators<00:03:52.840> they<00:03:52.959> were<00:03:53.110> getting<00:03:53.320> bitten

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:55.740 
dog they got a lot of second chance Oh

00:03:55.740 --> 00:04:00.150 
dog they got a lot of second chance Oh
shots<00:03:56.740> because<00:03:57.100> of<00:03:57.490> that<00:03:58.740> we<00:03:59.740> can't<00:03:59.950> let<00:04:00.100> it

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:00.160 
shots because of that we can't let it

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:02.730 
shots because of that we can't let it
down
