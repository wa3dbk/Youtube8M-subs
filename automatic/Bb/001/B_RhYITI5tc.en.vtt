00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.390
 ready can leave anxiety aside 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:08.820
 Why will you meet now? 

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:14.070
 the citroen ds3 by emilio 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:16.650
 camanzi are you looking for a car? 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:20.189
 to differentiate the crowd is looking 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:22.410
 a good suggestion here citroen ds3 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.680
 if there is one thing he can not do is 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:27.449
 go unnoticed 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:28.740
 you can try to be more discreet with 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:31.140
 He's all black. 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.690
 but if you want to dare more you can 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.790
 customize your taste by choosing 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:40.260
 different vivid colors on the ceiling and 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:43.710
 on the wheels in the upholstery in the 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:46.440
 Panel as the shift lever in 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:49.170
 key and still placing stickers or 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.640
 tracks and inside keeps the same 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:54.059
 charm 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:56.399
 I can not call it used as an exterior 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:58.949
 but it is out of the ordinary by pulling 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:01.070
 the sport side allied to good materials 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:04.799
 and a Germanic style finish 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:07.260
 aggravates and has a good front space well 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:08.790
 understood because here behind despite 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:12.750
 take place for three 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:15.660
 that's how we say too warm 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:18.210
 without major problems since the 280 liters 

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:20.580
 capacity of the trunk 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.140
 recommended for a family or 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:27.240
 his proposal 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:30.390
 the ds acronym refers to the 1955 model 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:32.729
 marked epoch by the innovative design this 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:35.490
 uses the same proposal to become the 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:41.640
 which the citroen called Turkish design on the 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:43.470
 popular car enjoying its performance 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:48.050
 be part of the choice 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:51.690
 it does not disappoint the engine is the 1.6 thp 

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:56.910
 developed by BMW and ps group 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:59.070
 the same used us got the 3008 408 and rcz 

00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:01.470
 and the mini cooper 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:04.020
 good torque at low revs 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:05.280
 a good one in the city without 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.550
 gear shifts 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:11.550
 only that in the thirteenth has a legal detail 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:14.190
 overbooking or over pressure to 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:17.070
 accelerate a little further in the third 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:18.930
 sixth the turbo increases pressure and a motor 

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:23.830
 provides two pounds more of torque 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:27.040
 for 25 seconds result 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:30.160
 How about a new champion in the back just one 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:31.150
 little nice and people were made 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:33.870
 great 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.870
 one of them 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:39.790
 the only six-speed manual gearbox 

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:42.069
 available contributes significantly to this 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:44.590
 be sure all euphoria is a 

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:46.599
 efficient disc brake system 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:49.180
 four-wheel drive and abs 

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:59.620
 Do you want to know something else? 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:03:02.170
 the consumption is good, right? 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:03.609
 firm suspension or a characteristic 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:09.189
 of French cars 

00:03:03.609 --> 00:03:11.680
 the ds3 is public and still has controls 

00:03:09.189 --> 00:03:14.019
 electronic traction and stability 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:17.049
 only that everything went well while the asphalt 

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:19.389
 smooth is just to paint the little holes and 

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:21.489
 battery gives the air of impaired grace 

00:03:19.389 --> 00:03:23.139
 also for low profile tires 

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:25.150
 in addition to transferring all 

00:03:23.139 --> 00:03:28.090
 irregularities from the floor to the interior 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:30.250
 making running uncomfortable arise 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:32.079
 various noises that bother and 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:34.269
 feeling of fragility 

00:03:32.079 --> 00:03:36.310
 the Citroen should do a job 

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:37.410
 better adaptation of the suspension to the 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:39.450
 Brazil 

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:42.300
 another thing you need to stay smart 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:44.520
 is with the visibility to the wide columns 

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:47.370
 lateral and back conflict 

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:49.340
 well-equipped crossings and maneuvers has 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:52.050
 a good value for money 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:54.840
 compared to rivals and segment with the 

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:57.990

00:03:54.840 --> 00:04:00.660
 It's bigger inside and bolder. 

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:17.040
 besides not going unnoticed you go 

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:20.130
 have fun enough with him charming 

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:23.060
