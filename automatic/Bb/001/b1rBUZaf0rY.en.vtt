00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:32.389 
are on a diet a couple of things happen
firstly<00:00:30.029> the<00:00:30.750> body<00:00:30.960> can't<00:00:31.410> put<00:00:31.710> alcohol<00:00:31.949> in

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
firstly the body can't put alcohol in

firstly the body can't put alcohol in
line<00:00:32.669> and<00:00:32.940> process<00:00:33.630> it<00:00:33.780> slowly<00:00:34.200> after

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:34.880 
line and process it slowly after

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:37.990 
line and process it slowly after
metabolizing<00:00:35.880> on<00:00:36.120> carbs<00:00:36.600> fats<00:00:36.960> and<00:00:37.230> proteins

alcohol has to be dealt with first so
the<00:00:41.700> food<00:00:41.910> in<00:00:42.059> your<00:00:42.210> body<00:00:42.420> gets<00:00:42.870> metabolized

only after the alcohol has been

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.340 
only after the alcohol has been
processed<00:00:46.649> that<00:00:47.579> means<00:00:47.969> weight<00:00:48.629> loss<00:00:48.870> is<00:00:49.110> put

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
processed that means weight loss is put

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.010 
processed that means weight loss is put
on<00:00:49.559> hold<00:00:49.910> once<00:00:50.910> the<00:00:51.180> alcohol<00:00:51.360> has<00:00:51.960> been

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
processes start up again

that's<00:00:57.090> how<00:00:57.390> alcohol<00:00:57.719> suppresses<00:00:58.710> the<00:00:58.890> body's

that's how alcohol suppresses the body's
fat-burning<00:00:59.690> ability<00:01:01.039> but<00:01:02.039> if<00:01:02.309> too<00:01:02.760> much

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
fat-burning ability but if too much

fat-burning ability but if too much
alcohol<00:01:03.270> is<00:01:03.690> consumed<00:01:04.260> then<00:01:04.890> it<00:01:05.220> can<00:01:05.430> cause

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
alcohol is consumed then it can cause

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.840 
alcohol is consumed then it can cause
malnutrition<00:01:06.500> the<00:01:07.500> body<00:01:07.710> becomes<00:01:08.159> so<00:01:08.520> caught

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
malnutrition the body becomes so caught

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.570 
malnutrition the body becomes so caught
up<00:01:08.880> in<00:01:09.299> getting<00:01:09.869> rid<00:01:10.110> of<00:01:10.350> the<00:01:10.500> alcohol<00:01:10.680> that

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
up in getting rid of the alcohol that

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.090 
up in getting rid of the alcohol that
food<00:01:11.880> is<00:01:12.090> not<00:01:12.240> processed<00:01:12.570> and<00:01:13.049> nutrition<00:01:13.860> is
