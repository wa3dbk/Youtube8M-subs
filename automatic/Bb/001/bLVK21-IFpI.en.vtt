00:02:07.839 --> 00:02:07.849 
off-camera flash and by the time the

00:02:07.849 --> 00:02:10.330 
off-camera flash and by the time the
actual<00:02:08.209> flash<00:02:08.479> occurs<00:02:08.840> moments<00:02:09.319> later<00:02:09.470> the

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:10.340 
actual flash occurs moments later the

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:13.479 
actual flash occurs moments later the

flash off camera is not recorded in the
frame<00:02:13.730> of<00:02:13.970> your<00:02:14.000> shot<00:02:15.069> which<00:02:16.069> is<00:02:16.220> confusing

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:16.670 
frame of your shot which is confusing

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:18.160 
frame of your shot which is confusing
because<00:02:16.790> you<00:02:17.060> would<00:02:17.180> see<00:02:17.360> the<00:02:17.480> flash<00:02:17.720> actually

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.170 
because you would see the flash actually

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:19.960 
because you would see the flash actually
go<00:02:18.290> off<00:02:18.440> but<00:02:18.769> it's<00:02:18.830> just<00:02:19.160> not<00:02:19.250> being<00:02:19.640> recorded

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:19.970 
go off but it's just not being recorded

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:23.860 
go off but it's just not being recorded
in<00:02:20.180> the<00:02:20.269> frame<00:02:20.510> but<00:02:21.640> it<00:02:22.640> is<00:02:22.819> basically<00:02:23.330> because

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:23.870 
in the frame but it is basically because

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:32.700 
in the frame but it is basically because
of<00:02:24.200> this<00:02:24.620> mountain<00:02:25.340> on<00:02:25.610> right<00:02:25.849> here
