here we have a receptor not use a line
to<00:00:26.800> the<00:00:26.890> fire<00:00:27.130> element<00:00:27.369> and<00:00:27.869> we've<00:00:28.869> turned<00:00:29.109> off

00:00:29.249 --> 00:00:29.259 
to the fire element and we've turned off

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:31.079 
to the fire element and we've turned off
it's<00:00:29.409> AI<00:00:29.650> and<00:00:30.099> there's<00:00:30.310> movement<00:00:30.519> and<00:00:30.789> attacks

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:54.670 
instructions for each ability as we go

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:56.280 
instructions for each ability as we go
through<00:00:54.880> them<00:00:55.000> so<00:00:55.750> the<00:00:55.840> first<00:00:55.960> I'm<00:00:56.140> going<00:00:56.230> to

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:56.290 
through them so the first I'm going to

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:57.510 
through them so the first I'm going to
choose<00:00:56.440> is<00:00:56.620> fireball<00:00:57.040> which<00:00:57.220> is<00:00:57.340> on<00:00:57.430> the

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:57.520 
choose is fireball which is on the

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:59.880 
choose is fireball which is on the
bottom<00:00:57.640> left<00:00:57.940> here<00:00:58.180> and<00:00:58.330> as<00:00:59.230> the<00:00:59.470> instruction

00:00:59.880 --> 00:00:59.890 
bottom left here and as the instruction

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:02.070 
bottom left here and as the instruction
see<00:01:00.010> if<00:01:00.190> I<00:01:00.280> flick<00:01:00.610> towards<00:01:01.510> the<00:01:01.600> spirit<00:01:01.930> to

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:02.080 
see if I flick towards the spirit to

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:04.189 
see if I flick towards the spirit to
shoot<00:01:02.350> a<00:01:02.410> fireball<00:01:02.830> so<00:01:03.370> I'm<00:01:03.430> going<00:01:03.610> to<00:01:03.670> do<00:01:03.760> that

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
shoot a fireball so I'm going to do that

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.359 
shoot a fireball so I'm going to do that
you<00:01:05.199> can<00:01:05.350> see<00:01:05.500> he's<00:01:05.680> quite<00:01:05.860> close<00:01:06.040> to<00:01:06.159> camera

00:01:06.359 --> 00:01:06.369 
you can see he's quite close to camera

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:07.920 
you can see he's quite close to camera
so<00:01:06.610> the<00:01:06.700> fireball<00:01:07.030> does<00:01:07.180> need<00:01:07.360> to<00:01:07.479> travel<00:01:07.689> far

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:07.930 
so the fireball does need to travel far

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:09.810 
so the fireball does need to travel far
it<00:01:07.990> very<00:01:08.170> fine<00:01:08.380> kitchen<00:01:08.770> I'll<00:01:09.520> do<00:01:09.700> it<00:01:09.790> again

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:09.820 
it very fine kitchen I'll do it again

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:11.460 
it very fine kitchen I'll do it again
and<00:01:10.480> this<00:01:10.600> handle<00:01:10.840> is<00:01:10.900> click<00:01:11.170> into<00:01:11.409> the

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:11.470 
and this handle is click into the

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:13.470 
and this handle is click into the
background<00:01:11.830> and<00:01:12.820> you<00:01:12.940> can<00:01:13.060> see<00:01:13.240> how<00:01:13.360> it

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:13.480 
background and you can see how it

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:15.060 
background and you can see how it
travels<00:01:13.659> and<00:01:14.140> then<00:01:14.530> collides<00:01:14.800> on<00:01:14.980> the

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:15.070 
travels and then collides on the

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:19.500 
travels and then collides on the
background<00:01:16.470> you<00:01:17.470> can<00:01:17.830> also<00:01:18.010> see<00:01:18.340> that<00:01:18.580> once<00:01:19.240> i

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:19.510 
background you can also see that once i

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:22.350 
background you can also see that once i
use<00:01:19.810> the<00:01:19.990> ability<00:01:20.400> that<00:01:21.400> it<00:01:21.460> has<00:01:21.820> a<00:01:21.850> recharge

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:22.360 
use the ability that it has a recharge

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:24.899 
use the ability that it has a recharge
time<00:01:22.420> so<00:01:23.200> i<00:01:23.229> can't<00:01:23.530> use<00:01:23.740> it<00:01:23.860> again<00:01:24.070> until<00:01:24.460> it's

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:24.909 
time so i can't use it again until it's

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:28.560 
time so i can't use it again until it's
become<00:01:25.150> recharged<00:01:26.400> and<00:01:27.400> every<00:01:28.090> ability<00:01:28.240> has

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:28.570 
become recharged and every ability has

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:29.690 
become recharged and every ability has
that<00:01:28.750> and<00:01:28.930> each<00:01:29.110> one<00:01:29.320> has<00:01:29.350> a<00:01:29.500> different

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
that and each one has a different

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.990 
that and each one has a different
recharge<00:01:30.700> time

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:32.000 
recharge time

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.880 
recharge time
so<00:01:33.000> now<00:01:33.150> i'm<00:01:33.270> going<00:01:33.330> to<00:01:33.480> choose<00:01:33.800> circle<00:01:34.800> of

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
so now i'm going to choose circle of

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.190 
so now i'm going to choose circle of
fire<00:01:35.100> and<00:01:35.400> i<00:01:36.030> have<00:01:36.210> to<00:01:36.330> draw<00:01:36.510> a<00:01:36.540> wall<00:01:36.810> of<00:01:36.930> flames

I<00:03:46.010> got<00:03:46.760> all<00:03:46.850> these<00:03:46.970> nice<00:03:47.210> blames<00:03:47.800> that<00:03:48.800> are

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:48.920 
I got all these nice blames that are

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:52.540 
I got all these nice blames that are
going<00:03:49.040> to<00:03:49.100> heal<00:03:49.280> me<00:03:50.800> not<00:03:51.800> I<00:03:51.830> needed<00:03:52.250> it<00:03:52.340> and

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:52.550 
going to heal me not I needed it and

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:54.940 
going to heal me not I needed it and
then<00:03:53.240> the<00:03:53.330> last<00:03:53.420> two<00:03:53.660> abilities<00:03:53.810> the<00:03:54.590> second

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:54.950 
then the last two abilities the second

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:57.550 
then the last two abilities the second
last<00:03:55.070> one<00:03:55.310> is<00:03:55.490> an<00:03:56.030> aura<00:03:56.240> of<00:03:56.420> radiant<00:03:56.810> heat<00:03:57.020> so

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:57.560 
last one is an aura of radiant heat so

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:59.320 
last one is an aura of radiant heat so
that's<00:03:57.770> a<00:03:57.890> permanent<00:03:58.130> that<00:03:58.610> that<00:03:58.910> turns<00:03:59.120> on

00:03:59.320 --> 00:03:59.330 
that's a permanent that that turns on

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:00.940 
that's a permanent that that turns on
permanently<00:03:59.870> until<00:04:00.020> I<00:04:00.170> turn<00:04:00.410> it<00:04:00.560> off<00:04:00.650> or<00:04:00.800> use

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:00.950 
permanently until I turn it off or use

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:02.920 
permanently until I turn it off or use
another<00:04:01.220> order<00:04:01.550> and<00:04:01.790> that<00:04:02.300> basically

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:02.930 
another order and that basically

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:05.110 
another order and that basically
increases<00:04:03.739> the<00:04:04.070> amount<00:04:04.130> of<00:04:04.310> fire<00:04:04.520> damage<00:04:04.760> that

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:05.120 
increases the amount of fire damage that

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:08.110 
increases the amount of fire damage that
I<00:04:05.209> do<00:04:05.270> so<00:04:06.140> if<00:04:06.440> your<00:04:06.680> fire<00:04:06.950> is<00:04:07.250> probably<00:04:07.880> quite<00:04:08.000> a

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:08.120 
I do so if your fire is probably quite a

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:10.479 
I do so if your fire is probably quite a
good<00:04:08.270> idea<00:04:08.540> to<00:04:08.690> have<00:04:08.810> power<00:04:09.020> and<00:04:09.310> the<00:04:10.310> last

00:04:10.479 --> 00:04:10.489 
good idea to have power and the last

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:13.270 
good idea to have power and the last
ability<00:04:10.910> is<00:04:11.090> flaming<00:04:11.570> fist<00:04:11.870> so<00:04:12.530> if<00:04:12.590> I<00:04:12.680> tap<00:04:13.010> my

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:13.280 
ability is flaming fist so if I tap my

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:16.000 
ability is flaming fist so if I tap my
target<00:04:14.060> I'm<00:04:14.450> going<00:04:14.690> to<00:04:14.750> smash<00:04:15.050> him<00:04:15.260> with<00:04:15.290> a

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:16.010 
target I'm going to smash him with a

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:17.680 
target I'm going to smash him with a
flaming<00:04:16.459> fist

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:17.690 
flaming fist

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:21.550 
flaming fist

part<00:04:24.290> in<00:04:24.350> a<00:04:24.440> battle<00:04:25.330> okay<00:04:26.330> so<00:04:26.750> here<00:04:26.930> we<00:04:27.020> have

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:27.050 
part in a battle okay so here we have

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:29.590 
part in a battle okay so here we have
the<00:04:27.200> spirit<00:04:27.560> that<00:04:27.740> it's<00:04:27.970> health<00:04:28.970> for<00:04:29.240> finished

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:31.400 
then I'm going to switch the AI on a

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:32.980 
then I'm going to switch the AI on a
second<00:04:31.760> and<00:04:31.970> he's<00:04:32.090> going<00:04:32.270> to<00:04:32.330> start<00:04:32.600> trying<00:04:32.810> to

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:32.990 
second and he's going to start trying to

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:34.870 
second and he's going to start trying to
attack<00:04:33.200> us<00:04:33.410> and<00:04:33.800> I'm<00:04:34.190> going<00:04:34.400> to<00:04:34.460> attack<00:04:34.670> him
