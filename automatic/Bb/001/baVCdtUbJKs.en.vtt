00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620

 unvarnished because I'm the same for 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.580
 I'll make you up and that's what I'm doing 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:11.130
 together with the pavillons lipstick the 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.750
 20 euro make up challenge on my 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.330
 dress you will find a make-up 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:18.060
 tutorial for a party make up what 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:20.490
 less than 20 euros and on your own 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:23.039
 channel you can make an everyday make-up 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.840
 See what could be cheaper than 20 euros 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:27.180
 will and i could definitely get up 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.369
 both videos are curious what is real 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.960
 not so easy and you like me 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.000
 to write in the comments 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.320
 if you like this make-up then on one 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.030
 party would wear 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.160
 and otherwise does not write happy times 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.379
 with the dear barbara over the power 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:43.680
 so sweet videos and just greets them 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:45.450
 from me because I like her so much and so much 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.309
 otherwise I would say I live now 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.329
 just let's go if you have a lot of fun 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.430
 with the video 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:53.010
 Of course I need foundation first 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.870
 By the way, not too blatant for my party 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.660
 make up and then I just take off 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:00.180
 Essens a foundation for two euros 45 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.559
 which I am very cheap and that can 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.260
 I only recommend you 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:06.390
 and then I have a shadow from P2 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.820
 taken and from katies so one 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:11.189
 eyeshadow applicator and have that 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.360
 just a kind of eyebrow 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:14.549
 filled up 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.990
 that worked quite well but he sets 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:18.000
 definitely not my eyebrows 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.670
 go now I have again woman nation 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.950
 taken and used as a kind of djs 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:25.080
 then I eyeshadow a yes 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.720
 palette taken from food and such a 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.640
 lighter color as well with this 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.950
 applicator on my eyelid 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.509
 applied and I think that looks quite 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.400
 nice, especially if then such a 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:38.490
 darker color with his visor brush 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:40.110
 still in the eyelid there then it looks 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.490
 actually quite nice you have to 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.380
 the colors only really very long 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.490
 dazzle and sometimes several 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.009
 Apply layers 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.329
 so that everything is really color now 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.050
 I have such a lighter color 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.610
 took 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:55.380
 and then under my eyebrows 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:57.690
 given with the gel one of the food so 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.680
 a very impractical tip has the 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:00.690
 very hard 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:02.910
 I also got tips 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:04.950
 pulled my eyeliner and pulled it 

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:05.430
 really was not as easy as you can see 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.660
 can 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:09.540
 and then I have a little bit more 

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:12.270
 shared leyen means my the upper one 

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:13.860
 Waterline also filled in black 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:17.190
 and then I have one of essens 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:18.720
 mascara takes two euros 44 and 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:20.850
 I used it to lash my eyelashes 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:23.520
 They are really really good , too 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:29.700
 Trend the band is quite good and I think 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:31.380
 These are not very nice I have the 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:33.330
 By the way, then worn longer 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:35.610
 and I can tell you that too 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:37.110
 lasts a long time and not one is 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:38.610
 support 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:40.620
 and then I just have another one 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:42.300
 bit of foundation over my face 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:43.950
 given because I still have a few 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:44.880
 impurities a bit better 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:46.350
 wanted to cover 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:48.270
 and then I have this one again 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:51.420
 donor countries and those on mine 

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:52.860
 then applied and lower waterline 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:55.350
 Finally I have it again 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:56.820
 taken this eyeshadow from p2 and 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:03:00.290
 then go try my fingers 

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:03.800
 as blond to apply what reasonably 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:03.800
 I would say 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:11.159
 And at the end , of course, comes 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:13.530
 still lipstick because I have the kÃ¤rntner 

00:03:11.159 --> 00:03:15.629
 street taken from p2 i love 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:17.700
 By the way, the lipsticks of P2 and the 

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:20.099
 especially and then I have mine 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:22.220
 opened the hair and then it was already 

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:25.170
 my meter finished 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:30.650
 and that's the complete make up now 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:30.650
 and only cost 18 euros 74 uhu 

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:35.940
 that is now my finished make up and 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:38.430
 I think it's less than 20 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:40.530
 euro costs really looks really complete 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:43.260
 I would still like to have a good time 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:45.269
 used a bit of concealer and powder 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:48.060
 but unfortunately that was no longer on budget 

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:50.489
 but win for less than 20 euros 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:51.959
 Okay so I like to switch times 

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:54.360
 your opinion in the comments 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:56.400
 Would you go to a party like this now? 

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:58.920
 or maybe I should him then 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:00.750
 stay at home and if you still are 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:02.760
 want to see a make up less 

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:04.739
 than 20 euro costs then just click 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:06.720
 then here you can do that 

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:09.030

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:10.860
 go lipstick and watch 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:12.360

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:13.890
 say that was it from me now 

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:15.810

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:20.180
