a hole I'm trying to help you out here
buddy<00:03:16.140> all<00:03:17.140> right<00:03:17.319> go<00:03:18.540> that's<00:03:19.540> why<00:03:19.690> it's

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:19.900 
buddy all right go that's why it's

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:22.860 
buddy all right go that's why it's
important<00:03:20.349> to<00:03:21.190> have<00:03:21.220> flat<00:03:22.030> surfaces<00:03:22.540> I<00:03:22.660> guess

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:22.870 
important to have flat surfaces I guess

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:30.600 
important to have flat surfaces I guess
so<00:03:23.410> this<00:03:23.799> does<00:03:24.069> not<00:03:24.220> happen<00:03:27.989> so<00:03:28.989> I<00:03:29.380> will<00:03:29.739> put<00:03:30.459> up

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:30.610 
so this does not happen so I will put up

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:35.580 
so this does not happen so I will put up
lets<00:03:30.910> us<00:03:33.540> this<00:03:34.540> video<00:03:34.870> might<00:03:35.110> not<00:03:35.319> have<00:03:35.500> an

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:35.590 
lets us this video might not have an

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:39.660 
lets us this video might not have an
intro<00:03:35.920> so<00:03:36.280> it<00:03:36.430> can<00:03:36.549> be<00:03:36.640> 720p<00:03:37.500> so<00:03:38.500> it'll<00:03:39.370> just<00:03:39.549> be

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:39.670 
intro so it can be 720p so it'll just be

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:43.410 
intro so it can be 720p so it'll just be
a<00:03:39.700> regular<00:03:39.880> video<00:03:40.840> and<00:03:42.060> that's<00:03:43.060> his<00:03:43.239> house

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:43.420 
a regular video and that's his house

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:45.780 
a regular video and that's his house
that's<00:03:43.720> actually<00:03:44.019> pretty<00:03:44.230> cool<00:03:44.640> better<00:03:45.640> than

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:45.790 
that's actually pretty cool better than

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:49.500 
that's actually pretty cool better than
anything<00:03:46.090> I<00:03:46.269> could<00:03:46.450> build<00:03:46.829> and<00:03:47.849> if<00:03:48.849> you<00:03:49.150> want

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:49.510 
anything I could build and if you want

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:54.259 
anything I could build and if you want
you<00:03:49.840> can<00:03:50.370> come<00:03:51.370> destroy<00:03:51.880> this<00:03:52.090> I<00:03:52.269> believe

00:03:54.259 --> 00:03:54.269 
you can come destroy this I believe

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:56.819 
you can come destroy this I believe
place<00:03:55.269> another<00:03:55.420> one<00:03:55.780> and<00:03:56.019> now<00:03:56.410> there's<00:03:56.560> two

00:03:56.819 --> 00:03:56.829

place another one and now there's two
guys<00:03:57.010> or<00:03:57.840> just<00:03:58.840> one<00:03:59.040> never<00:04:00.040> mind<00:04:00.280> I'm<00:04:01.269> wrong

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:05.920 

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:13.590 

so<00:04:06.520> can<00:04:06.760> you<00:04:06.790> really<00:04:07.209> get<00:04:07.420> yeah

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:13.600 

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:15.420

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:15.430 
if you want to make a little village

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:17.580 
if you want to make a little village
sort<00:04:15.850> of<00:04:15.970> thing<00:04:16.120> with<00:04:16.300> it<00:04:16.480> just<00:04:17.230> put<00:04:17.380> another

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:17.590 
sort of thing with it just put another

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:21.060 
sort of thing with it just put another
one<00:04:17.740> down<00:04:17.950> and<00:04:18.310> you<00:04:18.550> can't<00:04:18.910> do<00:04:19.120> this<00:04:19.890> if<00:04:20.890> she

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:21.070 
one down and you can't do this if she

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:22.620 
one down and you can't do this if she
could<00:04:21.190> only<00:04:21.220> have<00:04:21.430> one<00:04:21.550> down<00:04:21.760> maybe<00:04:22.510> in<00:04:22.570> a

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:22.630 
could only have one down maybe in a

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:25.470 
could only have one down maybe in a
certain<00:04:22.840> area<00:04:23.640> no<00:04:24.640> well<00:04:24.970> so<00:04:25.090> you<00:04:25.240> only<00:04:25.390> have

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:25.480 
certain area no well so you only have

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:33.240 
certain area no well so you only have
one<00:04:25.690> down<00:04:25.900> at<00:04:26.080> a<00:04:26.140> time<00:04:29.340> it's<00:04:30.340> okay<00:04:30.610> though<00:04:32.250> with

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:33.250 
one down at a time it's okay though with

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:35.820 
one down at a time it's okay though with
this<00:04:33.370> mod<00:04:33.610> they're<00:04:33.880> supposed<00:04:34.240> to<00:04:34.300> be<00:04:34.830> other

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:35.830 
this mod they're supposed to be other

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:37.500 
this mod they're supposed to be other
updates<00:04:36.310> coming<00:04:36.610> out<00:04:36.730> with<00:04:36.820> it<00:04:36.940> so<00:04:37.120> they<00:04:37.330> can

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:37.510 
updates coming out with it so they can

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:40.740 
updates coming out with it so they can
be<00:04:37.660> like<00:04:38.350> a<00:04:38.620> minor<00:04:39.390> instead<00:04:40.390> of<00:04:40.420> just<00:04:40.630> a

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:40.750 
be like a minor instead of just a

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:42.600 
be like a minor instead of just a
lumberjack<00:04:41.230> there'll<00:04:41.500> be<00:04:41.530> different<00:04:41.920> jobs<00:04:42.400> I

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:42.610 
lumberjack there'll be different jobs I

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:47.610 
lumberjack there'll be different jobs I
guess<00:04:43.200> there'll<00:04:44.200> be<00:04:44.230> a<00:04:44.350> guard<00:04:46.290> once<00:04:47.290> this<00:04:47.440> is

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:47.620 
guess there'll be a guard once this is

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:49.290 
guess there'll be a guard once this is
in<00:04:47.740> like<00:04:47.950> the<00:04:48.100> full<00:04:48.310> version<00:04:48.490> this<00:04:48.790> is<00:04:48.850> unlike

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:49.300 
in like the full version this is unlike

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:53.190 
in like the full version this is unlike
point<00:04:49.690> one<00:04:50.020> four<00:04:50.320> of<00:04:51.160> its<00:04:51.370> testing<00:04:51.900> so<00:04:52.900> there's

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:53.200 
point one four of its testing so there's

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:55.800 
point one four of its testing so there's
there<00:04:53.590> is<00:04:53.740> bugs<00:04:54.090> you<00:04:55.090> always<00:04:55.270> have<00:04:55.420> to<00:04:55.510> expect

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:55.810 
there is bugs you always have to expect

00:04:55.810 --> 00:05:05.400 
there is bugs you always have to expect
that<00:04:55.900> all<00:04:59.850> right<00:05:00.850> well<00:05:03.750> as<00:05:04.750> you<00:05:04.930> can<00:05:05.020> see<00:05:05.080> he

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:05.410 
that all right well as you can see he

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:07.260 
that all right well as you can see he
drops<00:05:05.680> he<00:05:06.040> doesn't<00:05:06.460> drop<00:05:06.580> he<00:05:06.760> puts<00:05:06.970> a<00:05:07.030> wooden

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:07.270 
drops he doesn't drop he puts a wooden

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:09.090 
drops he doesn't drop he puts a wooden
here<00:05:07.420> for<00:05:07.600> me<00:05:07.720> so<00:05:07.930> it's<00:05:08.740> a<00:05:08.800> good<00:05:08.920> way<00:05:09.040> to

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:09.100 
here for me so it's a good way to

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:10.890 
here for me so it's a good way to
harvest<00:05:09.460> would<00:05:09.610> once<00:05:10.240> the<00:05:10.390> trees<00:05:10.570> are<00:05:10.750> gone

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:10.900 
harvest would once the trees are gone

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:13.160 
harvest would once the trees are gone
they<00:05:11.110> do<00:05:11.170> not<00:05:11.410> go<00:05:11.650> that<00:05:11.890> far<00:05:12.190> away<00:05:12.340> from<00:05:12.460> I

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:13.170 
they do not go that far away from I

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:15.570 
they do not go that far away from I
think<00:05:14.170> they<00:05:14.290> can<00:05:14.470> only<00:05:14.620> go<00:05:14.800> up<00:05:14.830> to<00:05:15.130> like<00:05:15.250> I

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:15.580 
think they can only go up to like I

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:17.820 
think they can only go up to like I
don't<00:05:16.540> know<00:05:16.750> I<00:05:16.960> might<00:05:17.230> be<00:05:17.380> wrong<00:05:17.530> when<00:05:17.710> I'm

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:17.830 
don't know I might be wrong when I'm

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:19.830 
don't know I might be wrong when I'm
saying<00:05:18.040> this<00:05:18.220> 60<00:05:18.790> spaces<00:05:19.240> away<00:05:19.330> from<00:05:19.660> their

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:19.840 
saying this 60 spaces away from their

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:23.760 
saying this 60 spaces away from their
Hut<00:05:20.080> and<00:05:20.320> then<00:05:21.190> at<00:05:21.400> I<00:05:22.290> don't<00:05:23.290> remember<00:05:23.350> if<00:05:23.650> it's

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:23.770 
Hut and then at I don't remember if it's

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:25.440 
Hut and then at I don't remember if it's
dust<00:05:24.130> or<00:05:24.340> something<00:05:24.460> we<00:05:24.820> start<00:05:25.060> going<00:05:25.150> back
