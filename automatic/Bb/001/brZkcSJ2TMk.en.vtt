00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.640
The local people are the ones who are suffering

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:31.400
and not getting any benefit.

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:33.100
We only get the suffering.

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:38.440
When there is ash from the plant, it’s the people here who suffer the pollution

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:41.380
as well as people in Sekopeng.

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:53.160
When the water is polluted, it’s Sekopeng people who suffer, not people living far away.

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:05.080
The power plant smells really strong.

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:10.740
In the dry season, the village is covered in ash.

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.260
Many kids around here get lung spots because of the ash.

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:29.780
There is one family who are leaving their home

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:32.680
because their child is ill.

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:40.860
I left this house because I don’t like living near the coal plant.

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.420
It’s noisy and dusty.

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:51.360
Also, my son is sick and sometimes he has a fever.

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.700
He is often short of breath.

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:01.840
The doctor said if we stay here much longer, his health will get worse.

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:15.200
Shortness of breath, coughs and colds in this area aren’t relate to the season

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:20.720
Every day I see patients with respiratory problems.

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:24.200
They are mostly babies,

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.580
only one or two months old.

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:33.500
We have to clean the house several times a day,

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:36.420
Three or four times a day.

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:38.660
If we don’t keep cleaning, it is dirty.

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:41.200
It’s because of the ashes from the coal plant.

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:51.600
If we complain about it, the coal company does nothing.

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:02.660
The rain washes the ash out of the air

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:08.580
and then the ash sticks to our clothes.

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:13.860
Maybe that's what makes the children sick

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:17.340
because they have weaker immune systems than adults

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:23.240
Also, the stockpiles of coal are too close to their homes.

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:27.100
No matter what, I just want my son to be healthy

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:32.360
We are very poor here.

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:36.480
I had to borrow money from people to pay for his medicine.

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:38.640
We did it so our child would be healthy.

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:42.980
So we moved from our house.

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:51.360
We can’t afford to build a new house like this one, but we had no choice.

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:59.000
It’s a pity I can’t live in my own dream home.

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:18.380
Ngelu is the worst area for children under five.

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:21.060
It’s near the coal power plant.

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:31.180
I can’t say for sure that the illnesses are because of the plant.

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:36.120
There’s no research or evidence for that yet.

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:43.440
When I lived here other families’ children also coughed and were short of breath.

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:47.800
Then they left, like me, to go to Sekopeng.

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:49.740
That’s what happened to our kids here.

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:53.660
The adults here also cough and are short of breath.

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:56.840
We have no peace of mind.

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:58.940
The coal power plant is noisy all the time.

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:01.400
It’s noisy even at night.

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:06.880
It sounds like an aeroplane.

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:10.600
If you suffer from heart disease or high blood pressure, this is a dangerous place.

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:29.400
If the number of coal plants here grows as they planned,

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:31.920
it is impossible the air quality here pass any standard.

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:34.040
Now they have their first and second coal plant, followed by the third and fourth.

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:36.780
I cannot imagine when they get their fifth and sixth plant developed.

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:40.000
The air which is already badly polluted now can be worsen.

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:48.240
Although I also live here, there isn't much I can do with this.

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:53.620
There isn't a party which can urged the coal plant to level up their safety.

00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:58.640
If possible, the coal plant here should be shut down.

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:02.400
If it's impossible, then they should find the way to make their business cleaner.

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:05.040
As I understand, it is partly owned by the government.

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:09.840
And the government functions to help the people to live a better life.

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:16.140
How can the people here including the farmers, the fishermen and other still be oppressed?
