well so my leans right now would be

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.660

the<00:01:38.009> 49ers<00:01:38.250> do<00:01:38.880> I<00:01:38.910> think<00:01:39.209> the<00:01:39.300> 49ers<00:01:39.660> really

00:01:40.309 --> 00:01:40.319 
the 49ers do I think the 49ers really

00:01:40.319 --> 00:01:41.749 
the 49ers do I think the 49ers really
got<00:01:40.530> what<00:01:40.679> they<00:01:40.830> needed<00:01:41.099> and<00:01:41.310> that<00:01:41.399> was<00:01:41.610> a<00:01:41.640> big

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
got what they needed and that was a big

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.600 
got what they needed and that was a big
marquee<00:01:42.509> win<00:01:42.750> against<00:01:43.530> their<00:01:43.649> rivals<00:01:43.830> Seattle

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
marquee win against their rivals Seattle

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.820 
marquee win against their rivals Seattle
Seahawks<00:01:45.060> let's<00:01:45.660> put<00:01:45.810> some<00:01:46.020> someone<00:01:46.440> back<00:01:46.649> in

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:46.830 
Seahawks let's put some someone back in

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:48.770 
Seahawks let's put some someone back in
the<00:01:46.920> division<00:01:47.039> race<00:01:47.399> but<00:01:47.640> more<00:01:47.849> or<00:01:47.970> less<00:01:48.149> right

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
the division race but more or less right

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.990 
the division race but more or less right
in<00:01:48.929> that<00:01:49.020> position<00:01:49.229> to<00:01:49.619> try<00:01:49.830> to<00:01:49.890> get<00:01:50.550> into<00:01:50.880> the

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
in that position to try to get into the

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.790 
in that position to try to get into the
playoffs<00:01:51.119> they're<00:01:51.660> still<00:01:51.929> very<00:01:52.170> much<00:01:52.500> in<00:01:52.770> the

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:52.800 
playoffs they're still very much in the

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:54.619 
playoffs they're still very much in the
hut<00:01:53.069> because<00:01:53.489> the<00:01:53.640> Arizona<00:01:54.030> Cardinals<00:01:54.300> are

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:54.629 
hut because the Arizona Cardinals are

00:01:54.629 --> 00:01:56.150 
hut because the Arizona Cardinals are
right<00:01:54.810> behind<00:01:55.020> them<00:01:55.349> and<00:01:55.500> they<00:01:55.590> still<00:01:55.890> play

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:56.160 
right behind them and they still play

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:58.130 
right behind them and they still play
each<00:01:56.310> other<00:01:56.429> so<00:01:56.729> I<00:01:56.759> think<00:01:56.849> the<00:01:57.060> 49ers<00:01:57.390> have<00:01:58.080> a

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
each other so I think the 49ers have a

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.529 
each other so I think the 49ers have a
lot<00:01:58.440> to<00:01:58.619> play<00:01:58.830> for<00:01:58.860> here<00:01:59.340> for<00:01:59.819> char<00:02:00.030> marks<00:02:00.330> got

00:02:00.529 --> 00:02:00.539 
lot to play for here for char marks got

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:02.089 
lot to play for here for char marks got
this<00:02:00.690> team<00:02:00.929> playing<00:02:01.170> a<00:02:01.229> lot<00:02:01.440> better<00:02:01.619> football

00:02:02.089 --> 00:02:02.099 
this team playing a lot better football

00:02:02.099 --> 00:02:04.070 
this team playing a lot better football
any<00:02:02.340> time<00:02:02.550> you<00:02:02.670> get<00:02:02.789> a<00:02:03.060> win<00:02:03.479> against<00:02:03.750> the<00:02:03.840> best

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:04.080 
any time you get a win against the best

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:05.660 
any time you get a win against the best
team<00:02:04.349> in<00:02:04.440> football<00:02:04.649> the<00:02:05.039> Seattle<00:02:05.220> Seahawks

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
team in football the Seattle Seahawks

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.790 
team in football the Seattle Seahawks
that's<00:02:06.479> a<00:02:06.629> feather<00:02:06.869> in<00:02:06.989> the<00:02:07.170> cap<00:02:07.200> I<00:02:07.649> don't

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:07.800 
that's a feather in the cap I don't

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:09.469 
that's a feather in the cap I don't
think<00:02:08.039> this<00:02:08.160> is<00:02:08.220> a<00:02:08.369> let<00:02:08.610> down<00:02:08.640> game<00:02:08.849> I<00:02:09.209> really

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
think this is a let down game I really

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:10.729 
think this is a let down game I really
going<00:02:09.750> in<00:02:09.810> only<00:02:09.959> got<00:02:10.170> to<00:02:10.229> travel<00:02:10.560> all<00:02:10.619> the<00:02:10.709> way

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
going in only got to travel all the way

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:13.040 
going in only got to travel all the way
to<00:02:10.830> east<00:02:11.039> coast<00:02:11.340> but<00:02:11.610> Tampa<00:02:12.390> Bay's<00:02:12.599> just<00:02:12.900> been

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
to east coast but Tampa Bay's just been

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.710 
to east coast but Tampa Bay's just been
up<00:02:13.200> and<00:02:13.410> down

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
up and down

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:15.510 
up and down
all<00:02:13.780> year<00:02:14.020> there's<00:02:14.320> someone<00:02:14.710> up<00:02:14.920> right<00:02:15.280> now

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:15.520

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:18.330 
all year there's someone up right now
but<00:02:16.240> again<00:02:16.390> a<00:02:16.840> tall<00:02:17.200> task<00:02:17.440> to<00:02:17.680> beat<00:02:17.830> a<00:02:17.860> 49er

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.340 
but again a tall task to beat a 49er

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:19.770 
but again a tall task to beat a 49er
team<00:02:18.610> that<00:02:18.730> I<00:02:18.790> think's<00:02:19.060> got<00:02:19.180> a<00:02:19.240> chip<00:02:19.480> on<00:02:19.630> their

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
team that I think's got a chip on their

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:21.750 
team that I think's got a chip on their
shoulder<00:02:20.170> still<00:02:20.710> has<00:02:20.860> a<00:02:20.890> lot<00:02:21.070> to<00:02:21.130> play<00:02:21.400> for<00:02:21.430> as

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760 
shoulder still has a lot to play for as

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:23.040 
shoulder still has a lot to play for as
you<00:02:21.880> said<00:02:22.120> they're<00:02:22.270> starting<00:02:22.570> to<00:02:22.600> get<00:02:22.720> healthy

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:23.050 
you said they're starting to get healthy

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:25.110 
you said they're starting to get healthy
on<00:02:23.170> both<00:02:23.380> sides<00:02:23.680> of<00:02:23.800> the<00:02:23.920> football<00:02:24.100> I<00:02:24.580> do<00:02:24.880> think

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120 
on both sides of the football I do think

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:27.150 
on both sides of the football I do think
the<00:02:25.240> 49ers<00:02:25.540> are<00:02:25.930> the<00:02:26.020> better<00:02:26.230> team<00:02:26.320> I<00:02:26.860> think

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:27.160 
the 49ers are the better team I think

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:28.950 
the 49ers are the better team I think
there's<00:02:27.340> a<00:02:27.370> better<00:02:27.520> coach<00:02:27.880> team<00:02:28.240> I<00:02:28.510> think<00:02:28.870> they

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:28.960 
there's a better coach team I think they

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:30.180 
there's a better coach team I think they
got<00:02:29.080> a<00:02:29.140> chip<00:02:29.350> on<00:02:29.500> their<00:02:29.650> shoulder<00:02:29.920> I<00:02:29.950> think<00:02:30.130> the

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.190 
got a chip on their shoulder I think the

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:32.100 
got a chip on their shoulder I think the
49ers<00:02:30.490> will<00:02:30.910> get<00:02:31.090> it<00:02:31.180> done<00:02:31.210> on<00:02:31.390> Sunday<00:02:31.870> against

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:32.110 
49ers will get it done on Sunday against

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:34.080 
49ers will get it done on Sunday against
the<00:02:32.200> Tampa<00:02:32.500> Bay<00:02:32.530> Bucs<00:02:32.920> all<00:02:33.310> right<00:02:33.490> fives<00:02:33.790> kind

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.090 
the Tampa Bay Bucs all right fives kind

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:35.010 
the Tampa Bay Bucs all right fives kind
of<00:02:34.150> a<00:02:34.210> lot<00:02:34.360> though<00:02:34.510> it<00:02:34.570> doesn't<00:02:34.720> scare<00:02:34.960> you

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:35.020

away<00:02:35.170> that<00:02:35.470> the<00:02:35.620> High<00:02:35.770> Line<00:02:35.950> I<00:02:36.220> do<00:02:36.580> think

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:36.940 
away that the High Line I do think

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:39.180 
away that the High Line I do think
they'll<00:02:37.090> get<00:02:37.240> this<00:02:37.450> one<00:02:37.660> by<00:02:37.840> 10<00:02:38.260> to<00:02:38.290> 15<00:02:38.800> points

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:39.190 
they'll get this one by 10 to 15 points

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:40.860 
they'll get this one by 10 to 15 points
is<00:02:39.310> my<00:02:39.430> best<00:02:39.700> guess<00:02:39.790> but<00:02:40.180> I<00:02:40.360> think<00:02:40.510> they<00:02:40.720> get<00:02:40.810> a

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
is my best guess but I think they get a

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:42.360 
is my best guess but I think they get a
double-digit<00:02:41.320> win<00:02:41.590> here<00:02:41.770> all<00:02:42.130> right
