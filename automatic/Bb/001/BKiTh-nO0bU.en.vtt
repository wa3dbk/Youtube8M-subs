00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.359
 today we are going to make cake pops or cross-eyed 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:07.830
 balls the ingredients will be sponge cake 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:11.010
 chocolate cream cheese for coverage 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:13.679
 colorful sticks and noodles we put on 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.440
 our super cow apron and let's 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:17.570
 Cook 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:18.980
 first of all we made a cake 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:21.259
 if you want to know how this is done 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:23.390
 basic cake click in the box 

00:00:21.259 --> 00:00:24.980
 that appears on the screen or also on the 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:26.950
 link that we will leave in the description 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:30.070
 of this video 

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:32.290
 once we have undone well the 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:36.060
 sponge cake with your hands let's go 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:38.520
 adding cream cheese little by little 

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:42.190
 and we will integrate it together with the 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:44.860
 sponge cake helping us with a fork 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:46.840
 we are testing 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:49.440
 until we get a mass 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:49.440
 consistent 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:56.860
 we will use our hands to mix 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:58.390
 well the cheese with the sponge cake you have to 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:01.870
 get 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:06.729
 a compact mass and now we're going to do 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:08.770
 balls of approximately 25 grams the 

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:11.060
 you can make bigger 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:13.280
 or smaller 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:16.100
 we want with the coming of 25 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:19.180
 grams is enough now the 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:23.740
 we crush well and we're going to mold them 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:23.740
 to form the ball well 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:27.900
 as if it were a meatball 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:35.250
 yes very well the ball shape 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:37.410
 and to the plate 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.090
 when we have made all our 

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:42.090
 balls 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:45.229
 let's let them rest for half 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.229
 time in the refrigerator 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:53.460
 and on the other hand we're going to melt 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:56.330
 chocolate this is chocolate coverage 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:59.100
 now once you are in the grandmother already 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:01.140
 refrigerated let's take a stick what 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.990
 let's put in the chocolate already 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:06.330
 then we will introduce it in 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:09.479
 our cake pop 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:11.700
 as you see in the video 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:13.090
 we are doing this with each of the 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:17.349
 balls 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:19.120
 we lower the stick we introduce it in the 

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:21.459
 ball 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:25.500
 and now once again we are going to put 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:25.500
 Refrigerate for about 10 minutes 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:31.830
 spent that time now let's catch and 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:31.830
 let's submerge 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:37.650
 chocolate cake pop 

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:40.680
 as you can see the container has to be 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:43.230
 narrow and deep so that the level of 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:46.500
 chocolate be high 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:49.409
 let's go patting on the wrist and 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:52.319
 spinning the one that pop so that the 

00:02:49.409 --> 00:02:55.910
 leftover chocolate fall 

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:58.940
 and now it only remains to decorate 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:03.580
 our cake pop in our case we are going to 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:03.580
 throw in this colorful noodle 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:08.439
 you can take what you have by hand 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:17.720
 and now we puncture it in a cork 

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:21.680
 They also sell special brackets for 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:23.950
 cake pop but the economic option is a 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:26.569
 cork of these 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:28.670
 let's go to another cake pop 

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:32.120
 we repeat the operation again giving us 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:35.980
 taps on the wrist and spinning to 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:35.980
 that the excess of chocolate falls 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:41.610
 and again we decorate with noodles 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:41.610
 colors 

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:50.370
 and from there to our cork 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:58.440
 let's now make one with almond 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:00.900
 chopped 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:03.650
 we will chop almonds all over 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:03.650
 our cake pop 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:10.760
 and again to the cork to dry 

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:12.860
 with this we will decorate it with a 

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:14.020
 white chocolate that we had from 

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:17.040
 green 

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:17.040
 we make some lines 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:24.020
 and you're ready to cork 

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:26.570
 and good the result here you have them 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:29.090
 some very nice and very nice 

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:30.310
 cake pop very easy to make and very 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:33.430
 rich 

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:36.640
 also as the dough is made with cheese 

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:39.670
 cream instead of with a cream 

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:41.930
 they are very rich and they are also 

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:43.699
 healthy 

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:46.190
