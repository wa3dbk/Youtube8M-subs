so<00:00:03.470> we've<00:00:03.620> been<00:00:03.770> using<00:00:04.010> these<00:00:04.310> baited<00:00:04.700> camera

00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:05.060 
so we've been using these baited camera

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:07.360 
so we've been using these baited camera
traps<00:00:05.359> for<00:00:05.660> survey<00:00:06.050> work<00:00:06.290> on<00:00:06.529> shark<00:00:06.830> abundance

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:07.370 
traps for survey work on shark abundance

and diversity in the Maldives although

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:12.520 
and diversity in the Maldives although
it's<00:00:10.700> similar<00:00:10.940> to<00:00:11.150> fishing<00:00:11.660> surveys<00:00:12.170> we

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:12.530 
it's similar to fishing surveys we

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:14.650 
it's similar to fishing surveys we
capture<00:00:12.950> the<00:00:13.040> Sharks<00:00:13.460> on<00:00:13.640> camera<00:00:14.150> instead<00:00:14.600> of

capture the Sharks on camera instead of

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:18.070 
capture the Sharks on camera instead of
using<00:00:14.900> a<00:00:15.080> hook<00:00:15.850> this<00:00:16.850> minimizes<00:00:17.210> risk<00:00:17.630> to<00:00:17.990> the

using a hook this minimizes risk to the

using a hook this minimizes risk to the
Sharks<00:00:18.530> but<00:00:18.800> also<00:00:18.950> shows<00:00:19.369> us<00:00:19.580> what<00:00:19.789> else<00:00:19.940> is

these<00:00:23.390> traps<00:00:23.810> we've<00:00:24.199> so<00:00:24.440> far<00:00:24.470> managed<00:00:25.070> to

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:25.190 
these traps we've so far managed to

it's great to see them so frequently as
now<00:00:58.579> we<00:00:58.639> only<00:00:58.940> see<00:00:59.239> them<00:00:59.389> occasionally<00:00:59.719> at<00:01:00.199> our

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:00.350 
now we only see them occasionally at our

interested in the base at all we found

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:22.270 
interested in the base at all we found
another<00:01:20.660> shark<00:01:21.200> it<00:01:21.470> looks<00:01:21.620> quite<00:01:21.890> similar<00:01:22.100> to

the nurse shark the zebra shark or
leopard<00:01:24.980> shark<00:01:25.280> because<00:01:25.460> is<00:01:25.640> also<00:01:25.940> known<00:01:27.220> it's

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:28.220 
leopard shark because is also known it's

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:29.620 
leopard shark because is also known it's
called<00:01:28.490> a<00:01:28.580> zebra<00:01:28.970> shark<00:01:29.270> because<00:01:29.450> the

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:29.630 
called a zebra shark because the

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:31.450 
called a zebra shark because the
juveniles<00:01:30.110> actually<00:01:30.560> have<00:01:30.680> very<00:01:30.710> distinct

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:31.460 
juveniles actually have very distinct

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:34.120 
juveniles actually have very distinct
vertical<00:01:32.030> black<00:01:32.300> and<00:01:32.540> white<00:01:32.690> stripes<00:01:33.170> but

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:34.130 
vertical black and white stripes but

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:35.710 
vertical black and white stripes but
these<00:01:34.370> fade<00:01:34.700> to<00:01:34.940> the<00:01:34.970> yellow<00:01:35.330> and<00:01:35.540> black

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:35.720 
these fade to the yellow and black

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:37.720 
these fade to the yellow and black
spotted<00:01:36.200> pattern<00:01:36.740> that<00:01:36.860> you<00:01:36.920> can<00:01:37.220> see<00:01:37.400> here

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:37.730 
spotted pattern that you can see here

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:39.880 
spotted pattern that you can see here
hence<00:01:38.540> why<00:01:38.750> it's<00:01:38.780> also<00:01:39.020> sometimes<00:01:39.470> called<00:01:39.680> a

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:39.890 
hence why it's also sometimes called a

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:43.630 
hence why it's also sometimes called a
leopard<00:01:40.220> shark<00:01:41.800> but<00:01:42.800> like<00:01:42.980> the<00:01:43.160> nurse<00:01:43.370> shark

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:43.640 
leopard shark but like the nurse shark

leopard shark but like the nurse shark

these guys are also suction feeders with
