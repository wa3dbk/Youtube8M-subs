00:00:02.950 --> 00:00:09.769
 3 dcg animator work with light wave 3d 

00:00:06.609 --> 00:00:14.389
 Character animation will be the main 

00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:17.030
 Of course you are confident in animation without having to touch the light web 3d 

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:24.530
 If you have one, you are welcome 

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:31.670
 It is important that the animator actually move the body to confirm the movement objectively 

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:34.130
 By doing so , you can notice various things such as moving the center of gravity or carrying your gaze 

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:37.370
 Accumulating such experiences 

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:40.990
 Sensuous and pose and movement 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:40.990
 Will be considered physically 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:54.500
 7 years animator of the work placement of the camera and the character on the basis of such Konkyo 

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:57.980
 Start by creating a layout 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:01:02.440
 And by making use of the Crossy experience 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:02.440
 I was riding in a jar car 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:05.340
 Ah ah ah 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:28.950
 3 dcg Modeler's work is with characters and background 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:31.950
 Make using light wave 3d 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:36.990
 I 'm interested in the structure of things 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:38.860
 If you love modeling, you do n't have to be a web 3d experience 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:44.320
 There is none 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:46.410
 It is not only something like modeling or industrial products that have been prepared 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:46.410
 Hmm 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:57.050
 It is from only one of the rough image 

00:01:51.510 --> 00:02:01.750
 Because I often do modeling while raising a model or designing 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:07.020
 Knowledge of design ability and structure is important 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:12.650
 How important it is for the modeler to pursue teal 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:18.489
 I'm thinking about collecting all kinds of materials and detailing 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:18.489
 Maybe it is what truly a shortcut to the modeler to claim 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:41.780
 Today I will introduce a generalist from everyone 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:45.080
 Please Zonchi Is God cafe video also I hemorrhoids Arisuto I generalist animation 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:50.120
 It is an important job involved in the overall production 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:52.620
 At first it is meeting , but contents and budget of work here 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:58.970
 And such closely Schedule 1 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:03:02.060
 And modeling based on the will you and discussed the contents of talking with light 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:05.300
 Only modela does not do modeling 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:11.150
 Generalist also as one of the modelers 

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:14.240
 We will do modeling and texture setting etc and we will move to the next section 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:18.960
 That is the setup and animation 

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:24.310
 There is also a will to change the set-up and animation for each each cut scene 

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:31.900
 It's a very important and transparent position. 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:33.130
 And finally, shooting is just about sewing the character and background 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:36.480
 There is none 

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:39.080
 That is absolute and character 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:41.260
 Ok i'm ok 

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:43.030
 No 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:45.550
 Poop 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:49.810
 I could not show it 

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:55.240
 Colors and effects after compositing with the character 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:55.930
 Or it is a very important position because knowledge such as layout is also needed 

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:59.950
 Ne 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:04:02.990
 Thus, the generalist can demonstrate his ability across different positions 

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:04.980
 Very important 

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:07.260
 Was one body worth 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:11.390
