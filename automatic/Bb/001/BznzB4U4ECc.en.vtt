for<00:02:13.230> roads<00:02:13.440> he<00:02:13.620> just<00:02:13.830> threw<00:02:13.980> the<00:02:14.100> fade<00:02:14.280> away<00:02:14.520> he

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
for roads he just threw the fade away he

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:16.280 
for roads he just threw the fade away he
didn't<00:02:15.300> look<00:02:15.390> like<00:02:15.450> he<00:02:15.660> wanted<00:02:15.900> to<00:02:15.960> fight<00:02:16.050> he

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290

turned<00:02:16.650> away<00:02:16.770> repeatedly<00:02:17.580> what<00:02:18.390> was<00:02:18.540> he<00:02:18.600> doing

turned away repeatedly what was he doing

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.350 
turned away repeatedly what was he doing
I<00:02:19.230> just<00:02:20.220> think<00:02:20.370> he's<00:02:20.520> lost<00:02:20.730> the<00:02:20.940> appetite<00:02:21.060> for

appetite for the game and I think he

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:28.700 
appetite for the game and I think he
doesn't<00:02:26.340> he<00:02:26.850> to<00:02:27.180> my<00:02:27.360> mind<00:02:27.660> he's<00:02:28.290> saying<00:02:28.530> too
