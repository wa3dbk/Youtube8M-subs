extensive training to learn every inch
of<00:02:43.610> the<00:02:43.760> boat<00:02:43.910> but<00:02:44.600> we<00:02:44.750> can<00:02:44.960> put<00:02:45.290> our<00:02:45.410> students

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:45.860 
of the boat but we can put our students

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:48.430 
of the boat but we can put our students
into<00:02:46.160> different<00:02:46.940> situations<00:02:47.180> that<00:02:48.170> would<00:02:48.290> be

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:48.440 
into different situations that would be

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:54.430 
into different situations that would be
too<00:02:48.650> high-risk<00:02:48.890> for<00:02:49.520> the<00:02:49.730> L<00:02:49.850> CAC<00:02:53.200> we<00:02:54.200> can

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:54.440 
too high-risk for the L CAC we can

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:56.190 
too high-risk for the L CAC we can
implement<00:02:54.980> any<00:02:55.340> different<00:02:55.820> type<00:02:56.000> of
