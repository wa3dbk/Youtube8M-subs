hi guys going to show you how to get
through<00:00:03.870> this<00:00:04.049> log<00:00:04.319> here<00:00:04.650> figure<00:00:05.549> out<00:00:05.609> the

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:05.700 
through this log here figure out the

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.509 
through this log here figure out the
combination<00:00:05.910> and<00:00:06.480> keep<00:00:06.660> it<00:00:06.779> intact<00:00:07.460> show<00:00:08.460> you

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:08.519 
combination and keep it intact show you

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:10.580 
combination and keep it intact show you
this<00:00:08.639> more<00:00:09.059> so<00:00:09.269> so<00:00:09.840> you<00:00:09.929> don't<00:00:10.080> trust<00:00:10.290> your

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
this more so so you don't trust your

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:12.020 
this more so so you don't trust your
valuables<00:00:11.130> with<00:00:11.309> such<00:00:11.490> a<00:00:11.519> lock<00:00:11.820> like<00:00:11.849> this

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
valuables with such a lock like this

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.720 
valuables with such a lock like this
it's<00:00:12.420> got<00:00:12.509> a<00:00:12.570> horrible<00:00:13.139> design<00:00:13.410> flaw<00:00:13.769> we're

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
it's got a horrible design flaw we're

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:16.310 
it's got a horrible design flaw we're
going<00:00:14.849> to<00:00:14.910> take<00:00:15.480> advantage<00:00:15.870> of<00:00:15.929> this<00:00:16.109> hole

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
going to take advantage of this hole

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:17.870 
going to take advantage of this hole
here<00:00:16.680> which<00:00:16.890> I<00:00:17.070> don't<00:00:17.130> even<00:00:17.310> know<00:00:17.520> why<00:00:17.699> it's

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
here which I don't even know why it's

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.830 
here which I don't even know why it's
there<00:00:18.090> but<00:00:19.080> it's<00:00:19.670> pretty<00:00:20.670> bad<00:00:20.850> so<00:00:21.570> all<00:00:21.750> you

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
there but it's pretty bad so all you

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.349 
there but it's pretty bad so all you
need<00:00:21.990> the<00:00:22.080> bobby<00:00:22.260> pin<00:00:22.730> straighten<00:00:23.730> it<00:00:23.789> out<00:00:23.910> cut

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
need the bobby pin straighten it out cut

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:26.060 
need the bobby pin straighten it out cut
the<00:00:24.480> tip<00:00:24.750> off<00:00:24.869> there<00:00:25.140> so<00:00:25.260> you<00:00:25.320> get<00:00:25.439> a<00:00:25.500> narrow

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
the tip off there so you get a narrow

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.769 
the tip off there so you get a narrow
piece<00:00:26.310> of<00:00:26.460> metal<00:00:26.820> like<00:00:27.590> that<00:00:29.449> I've<00:00:30.449> seen<00:00:30.630> this

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
piece of metal like that I've seen this

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:32.569 
piece of metal like that I've seen this
similar<00:00:31.170> lock<00:00:31.380> and<00:00:31.619> other<00:00:31.740> brands<00:00:32.070> and<00:00:32.520> I

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
similar lock and other brands and I

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.190 
similar lock and other brands and I
think<00:00:32.820> it<00:00:32.910> probably<00:00:33.030> the<00:00:33.360> same<00:00:33.570> but<00:00:33.809> I<00:00:33.840> only

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
think it probably the same but I only

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.000 
think it probably the same but I only
own<00:00:34.380> this<00:00:34.559> one<00:00:34.800> and<00:00:35.010> I<00:00:35.370> once<00:00:35.640> use<00:00:35.790> this<00:00:35.940> lock<00:00:36.210> so

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:37.010 
own this one and I once use this lock so

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:38.360 
own this one and I once use this lock so
not<00:00:38.010> anymore

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
not anymore

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.880 
not anymore
anyway<00:00:39.170> the<00:00:40.170> combination<00:00:40.710> is<00:00:40.829> 2<00:00:41.040> 4<00:00:41.309> 6<00:00:41.520> 8<00:00:42.469> 2<00:00:43.469> 4<00:00:43.500> 6

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
anyway the combination is 2 4 6 8 2 4 6

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.010 
anyway the combination is 2 4 6 8 2 4 6
8<00:00:44.129> there<00:00:44.460> it<00:00:44.579> is<00:00:44.730> lined<00:00:45.360> up<00:00:45.510> with<00:00:45.660> the<00:00:45.780> with

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
8 there it is lined up with the with

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.380 
8 there it is lined up with the with
this<00:00:46.140> line<00:00:46.379> here<00:00:46.739> it<00:00:47.550> unlocks<00:00:47.910> it's<00:00:48.149> not<00:00:48.270> the

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
this line here it unlocks it's not the

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.479 
this line here it unlocks it's not the
most<00:00:48.539> secure<00:00:48.809> lock<00:00:49.020> anyway<00:00:49.469> you<00:00:50.219> like<00:00:50.370> to

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
most secure lock anyway you like to

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:51.680 
most secure lock anyway you like to
think<00:00:50.640> that<00:00:50.670> it<00:00:50.820> would<00:00:50.910> stay<00:00:51.120> locked

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
think that it would stay locked

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.830 
think that it would stay locked
relatively<00:00:52.199> easy<00:00:52.320> so<00:00:53.059> jumbled<00:00:54.059> it<00:00:54.120> up<00:00:54.239> it's

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
relatively easy so jumbled it up it's

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:55.700 
relatively easy so jumbled it up it's
nice<00:00:55.050> that<00:00:55.079> you<00:00:55.289> can<00:00:55.350> set<00:00:55.559> your<00:00:55.680> own

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
nice that you can set your own

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.670 
nice that you can set your own
combination<00:00:56.270> by<00:00:57.270> flipping<00:00:57.539> the<00:00:57.780> thing<00:00:58.530> around

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
combination by flipping the thing around

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.590 
combination by flipping the thing around
and<00:00:59.010> pushing<00:00:59.160> down<00:00:59.280> and<00:00:59.579> picking<00:01:00.059> any

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
and pushing down and picking any

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.039 
and pushing down and picking any
combination<00:01:01.050> you<00:01:01.079> want<00:01:01.260> anyway<00:01:02.750> this<00:01:03.750> little

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
combination you want anyway this little

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:05.299 
combination you want anyway this little
hole<00:01:04.199> here<00:01:04.439> is<00:01:04.619> where<00:01:04.979> we're<00:01:05.070> going<00:01:05.159> to<00:01:05.250> put

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
hole here is where we're going to put

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.380 
hole here is where we're going to put
this<00:01:05.430> bobby<00:01:05.670> pin<00:01:07.610> down<00:01:08.610> there<00:01:08.820> like<00:01:08.939> so<00:01:09.210> and

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
this bobby pin down there like so and

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.810 
this bobby pin down there like so and
just<00:01:09.450> rotate<00:01:10.140> the<00:01:10.260> dials<00:01:10.650> until<00:01:10.950> it<00:01:11.100> it<00:01:11.610> goes

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
just rotate the dials until it it goes

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:17.600 
just rotate the dials until it it goes
down<00:01:13.280> you're<00:01:14.280> just<00:01:14.520> there<00:01:15.030> goes<00:01:15.299> one<00:01:16.610> there's

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
down you're just there goes one there's

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:23.149 
down you're just there goes one there's
a<00:01:17.700> pretty<00:01:18.320> good<00:01:19.320> amount<00:01:19.560> of<00:01:19.740> play<00:01:20.100> in<00:01:20.369> there<00:01:22.159> so

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
a pretty good amount of play in there so

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.820 
a pretty good amount of play in there so
just<00:01:23.310> kind<00:01:23.520> of<00:01:23.580> find<00:01:23.759> the<00:01:23.850> middle<00:01:24.119> and<00:01:25.110> that

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
just kind of find the middle and that

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.219 
just kind of find the middle and that
and<00:01:26.070> that's<00:01:26.250> not<00:01:26.460> the<00:01:26.580> number<00:01:26.850> we<00:01:26.970> need<00:01:27.229> but

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
and that's not the number we need but

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:32.749 
and that's not the number we need but
that's<00:01:28.590> ok<00:01:29.100> we'll<00:01:29.310> just<00:01:29.490> keep<00:01:29.610> going<00:01:31.759> another

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
that's ok we'll just keep going another

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:38.980 
that's ok we'll just keep going another
one<00:01:33.030> there<00:01:33.299> and<00:01:34.159> another<00:01:35.159> one<00:01:37.100> nothing<00:01:38.100> tricky

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:38.990 
one there and another one nothing tricky

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:43.310 
one there and another one nothing tricky
pretty<00:01:39.990> simple<00:01:41.540> like<00:01:42.540> and<00:01:42.899> you<00:01:42.960> could<00:01:43.110> feel

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
pretty simple like and you could feel

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.499 
pretty simple like and you could feel
like<00:01:43.350> kind<00:01:43.619> of<00:01:43.770> as<00:01:43.920> I<00:01:44.670> as<00:01:45.000> I<00:01:45.180> turn<00:01:45.360> the<00:01:45.479> wheel

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
like kind of as I as I turn the wheel

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.690 
like kind of as I as I turn the wheel
you<00:01:45.780> can<00:01:45.840> see<00:01:46.020> that<00:01:46.229> if<00:01:46.950> you<00:01:47.100> move<00:01:47.340> I'm<00:01:47.520> not

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
you can see that if you move I'm not

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.749 
you can see that if you move I'm not
down<00:01:47.909> there<00:01:48.119> yet<00:01:49.159> there<00:01:50.159> it<00:01:50.280> goes<00:01:50.430> all<00:01:50.640> the<00:01:50.670> way

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
down there yet there it goes all the way

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:53.359 
down there yet there it goes all the way
down<00:01:51.000> now<00:01:51.530> I'm<00:01:52.530> down<00:01:52.680> in<00:01:52.890> there<00:01:53.040> all<00:01:53.159> the<00:01:53.280> way

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
down now I'm down in there all the way

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:59.950 
down now I'm down in there all the way
so<00:01:54.000> just<00:01:54.450> kind<00:01:54.630> of<00:01:54.689> find<00:01:54.899> the<00:01:54.990> middle

00:01:59.950 --> 00:01:59.960 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:02.320 

pretty<00:02:00.740> big<00:02:00.950> gaps<00:02:01.190> in<00:02:01.400> those<00:02:01.580> disks<00:02:02.210> that

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:02.330 
pretty big gaps in those disks that

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:04.200 
pretty big gaps in those disks that
holding<00:02:02.630> it<00:02:02.720> together

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:04.210 
holding it together

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:06.520 
holding it together
flip<00:02:05.210> it<00:02:05.330> over<00:02:05.450> and<00:02:05.840> there's<00:02:06.410> your

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:06.530 
flip it over and there's your

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:09.130 
flip it over and there's your
combination<00:02:07.509> so<00:02:08.509> that's<00:02:08.869> not<00:02:09.020> the

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:09.140 
combination so that's not the

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:11.070 
combination so that's not the
combination<00:02:09.590> that<00:02:09.680> did<00:02:09.830> not<00:02:09.950> unlock<00:02:10.280> the<00:02:10.460> lock

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:11.080 
combination that did not unlock the lock

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:15.490 
combination that did not unlock the lock
but<00:02:12.080> it<00:02:13.010> did<00:02:13.220> give<00:02:13.700> us<00:02:13.820> a<00:02:13.940> combination<00:02:14.540> through

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:15.500 
but it did give us a combination through

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:18.840 
but it did give us a combination through
putting<00:02:15.770> the<00:02:15.920> bobby<00:02:16.100> pin<00:02:16.370> through<00:02:16.550> that<00:02:16.700> hole

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:18.850 
putting the bobby pin through that hole

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:28.000 
putting the bobby pin through that hole
so<00:02:19.850> just<00:02:20.120> gotta<00:02:20.360> rotate<00:02:23.740> two<00:02:25.600> four<00:02:26.650> six<00:02:27.650> eight

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010 
so just gotta rotate two four six eight

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:30.640 
so just gotta rotate two four six eight
that<00:02:28.880> goes<00:02:29.150> and<00:02:29.930> if<00:02:30.140> you<00:02:30.200> want<00:02:30.320> to<00:02:30.380> change<00:02:30.500> the

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
that goes and if you want to change the

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:33.010 
that goes and if you want to change the
combination<00:02:30.920> push<00:02:31.250> it<00:02:31.370> down<00:02:31.550> and<00:02:31.790> the<00:02:32.780> say

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:33.020 
combination push it down and the say

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:37.630 
combination push it down and the say
it's<00:02:33.230> going<00:02:33.470> to<00:02:33.560> be<00:02:33.620> four<00:02:36.070> there<00:02:37.070> that's<00:02:37.490> the

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:37.640 
it's going to be four there that's the

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:42.580 
it's going to be four there that's the
new<00:02:37.760> combination<00:02:38.380> pretty<00:02:39.380> simple<00:02:39.709> to<00:02:39.830> set<00:02:41.590> but

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:42.590 
new combination pretty simple to set but

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:44.890 
new combination pretty simple to set but
really<00:02:43.250> easy<00:02:43.370> to<00:02:43.490> get<00:02:43.670> through<00:02:43.940> pretty<00:02:44.810> much

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
really easy to get through pretty much

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:47.320 
really easy to get through pretty much
worthless<00:02:45.320> if<00:02:45.950> you<00:02:46.070> know<00:02:46.160> how<00:02:46.250> to<00:02:46.340> how<00:02:47.060> to<00:02:47.120> beat

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:47.330 
worthless if you know how to how to beat

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:48.730 
worthless if you know how to how to beat
it<00:02:47.480> you<00:02:47.870> could<00:02:48.020> probably<00:02:48.230> go<00:02:48.440> through<00:02:48.620> this

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:48.740 
it you could probably go through this

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:51.580 
it you could probably go through this
hole<00:02:49.010> and<00:02:49.690> get<00:02:50.690> the<00:02:50.720> combination<00:02:51.260> to<00:02:51.350> lined<00:02:51.500> up

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:51.590 
hole and get the combination to lined up

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:53.740 
hole and get the combination to lined up
on<00:02:51.709> this<00:02:51.830> side<00:02:52.070> but<00:02:52.850> it's<00:02:52.970> just<00:02:53.330> tough<00:02:53.540> with

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:53.750 
on this side but it's just tough with

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:55.870 
on this side but it's just tough with
the<00:02:53.840> shackle<00:02:54.200> being<00:02:54.350> on<00:02:54.470> the<00:02:54.560> way<00:02:54.680> anyway<00:02:55.640> you

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:55.880 
the shackle being on the way anyway you

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:57.190 
the shackle being on the way anyway you
like<00:02:56.000> the<00:02:56.150> video<00:02:56.420> check<00:02:56.660> out<00:02:56.720> my<00:02:56.840> other<00:02:57.020> ones

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:57.200 
like the video check out my other ones

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:58.240 
like the video check out my other ones
they're<00:02:57.380> pretty<00:02:57.620> similar<00:02:57.860> you'd<00:02:58.100> probably

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:58.250 
they're pretty similar you'd probably

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:59.980 
they're pretty similar you'd probably
enjoy<00:02:58.400> them<00:02:58.760> too

00:02:59.980 --> 00:02:59.990 
enjoy them too

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:01.930 
enjoy them too
