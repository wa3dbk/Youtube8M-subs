00:04:04.749 --> 00:04:04.759 
there figured I get one more look at

00:04:04.759 --> 00:04:06.520 
there figured I get one more look at
them<00:04:04.909> since<00:04:05.150> they<00:04:05.269> it's<00:04:05.900> been<00:04:05.989> a<00:04:06.109> while<00:04:06.319> since

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:06.530 
them since they it's been a while since

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:07.839 
them since they it's been a while since
I<00:04:06.650> got<00:04:06.799> a<00:04:06.829> good<00:04:06.979> look<00:04:07.040> at<00:04:07.189> these<00:04:07.310> bikes<00:04:07.609> and

00:04:07.839 --> 00:04:07.849 
I got a good look at these bikes and

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:12.550 
I got a good look at these bikes and
they<00:04:08.269> really<00:04:08.840> do<00:04:09.259> look<00:04:09.290> cool

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:12.560 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:14.740 

see<00:04:13.459> some<00:04:13.700> of<00:04:13.730> the<00:04:13.849> modifications<00:04:14.120> that<00:04:14.660> I

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:14.750 
see some of the modifications that I

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:17.289 
see some of the modifications that I
made<00:04:14.989> to<00:04:15.020> mine<00:04:15.319> as<00:04:15.620> his<00:04:15.800> doesn't<00:04:16.040> have<00:04:16.220> my<00:04:17.090> blue

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:17.299 
made to mine as his doesn't have my blue

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:19.420 
made to mine as his doesn't have my blue
one<00:04:17.450> has<00:04:17.630> a<00:04:17.660> actual<00:04:18.530> rounded<00:04:18.889> rear<00:04:19.040> fender

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:19.430 
one has a actual rounded rear fender

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:20.890 
one has a actual rounded rear fender
where<00:04:19.609> it<00:04:19.700> says<00:04:19.850> has<00:04:20.030> that<00:04:20.209> pointy<00:04:20.570> one<00:04:20.720> and<00:04:20.870> I

where it says has that pointy one and I

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:22.360 
where it says has that pointy one and I
take<00:04:21.079> the<00:04:21.200> glove<00:04:21.440> off<00:04:21.590> but<00:04:21.889> that's<00:04:22.070> where<00:04:22.250> his

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:22.370 
take the glove off but that's where his

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:23.830 
take the glove off but that's where his
license<00:04:22.880> plate<00:04:23.060> is<00:04:23.090> that<00:04:23.330> so<00:04:23.480> we're<00:04:23.600> not<00:04:23.690> going

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:23.840 
license plate is that so we're not going

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:25.810 
license plate is that so we're not going

to share that with the Internet of

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:27.070 
to share that with the Internet of
course<00:04:26.120> might<00:04:26.480> have<00:04:26.630> the<00:04:26.690> different<00:04:26.930> paint

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:27.080 
course might have the different paint

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:28.600

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:30.970 
job different paint scheme it's been
repainted<00:04:28.910> by<00:04:29.240> me<00:04:29.419> so<00:04:30.139> I<00:04:30.200> went<00:04:30.380> with<00:04:30.530> just<00:04:30.830> a

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:30.980 
repainted by me so I went with just a

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:32.500 
repainted by me so I went with just a
simple<00:04:31.280> silver<00:04:31.610> side<00:04:31.880> and<00:04:32.090> I<00:04:32.150> was<00:04:32.300> going<00:04:32.450> to

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:32.510 
simple silver side and I was going to

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:34.570 
simple silver side and I was going to
put<00:04:32.690> a<00:04:32.720> logo<00:04:33.050> that<00:04:33.200> said<00:04:33.470> chopper<00:04:33.889> Suey<00:04:34.160> on<00:04:34.460> the

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:34.580 
put a logo that said chopper Suey on the

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:35.830 
put a logo that said chopper Suey on the
side<00:04:34.760> of<00:04:34.790> it<00:04:34.970> but<00:04:35.150> I<00:04:35.180> haven't<00:04:35.510> done<00:04:35.600> that<00:04:35.660> yet

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:35.840 
side of it but I haven't done that yet

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:38.200 
side of it but I haven't done that yet
this<00:04:36.710> has<00:04:36.889> had<00:04:37.070> the<00:04:37.220> old<00:04:37.340> scalloped<00:04:37.850> look<00:04:38.030> to

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:38.210 
this has had the old scalloped look to

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:40.990 
this has had the old scalloped look to
it<00:04:38.330> so<00:04:39.169> I've<00:04:39.290> repainted<00:04:39.830> that<00:04:40.040> I've<00:04:40.820> also

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:41.000

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:43.010 
painted my front fender blue which

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:45.219 
painted my front fender blue which
really<00:04:43.280> complements<00:04:43.880> the<00:04:43.970> bike<00:04:44.150> factory<00:04:44.990> was

00:04:45.219 --> 00:04:45.229 
really complements the bike factory was

00:04:45.229 --> 00:04:48.340 
really complements the bike factory was
more<00:04:45.470> of<00:04:45.560> a<00:04:45.680> silver<00:04:46.340> color<00:04:46.550> like<00:04:46.790> that<00:04:47.350> also

00:07:31.710 --> 00:07:33.860 
so that way I know where the block
belongs<00:07:32.130> so<00:07:32.940> that<00:07:33.090> way<00:07:33.180> when<00:07:33.300> the<00:07:33.419> car<00:07:33.599> pulls

00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:33.870

00:07:37.969 --> 00:07:37.979 
important because otherwise i'll be

00:07:37.979 --> 00:07:40.399

00:07:40.409 --> 00:07:42.320 
slamming into the axle stub that's
sticking<00:07:40.770> out<00:07:41.009> here<00:07:41.280> and<00:07:41.460> that'll<00:07:41.940> dig<00:07:42.150> right

00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:42.330 
sticking out here and that'll dig right
