00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:29.449 
see a process that's highlighted called

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:32.409 
see a process that's highlighted called

Java w exe when you right-click this

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:35.439 
Java w exe when you right-click this
there<00:00:33.260> should<00:00:33.289> be<00:00:33.829> a<00:00:33.860> better<00:00:34.460> bigger<00:00:34.879> list<00:00:35.149> for

00:00:35.439 --> 00:00:35.449 
there should be a better bigger list for

00:00:35.449 --> 00:00:37.630 
there should be a better bigger list for
you<00:00:35.600> but<00:00:35.840> for<00:00:35.870> me<00:00:36.050> I<00:00:36.170> don't<00:00:36.440> have<00:00:36.649> set<00:00:37.039> priority

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:37.640 
you but for me I don't have set priority

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:39.819 
you but for me I don't have set priority
so<00:00:38.359> first<00:00:38.840> off<00:00:39.050> you're<00:00:39.199> going<00:00:39.289> to<00:00:39.379> want<00:00:39.500> to<00:00:39.559> set

00:00:39.819 --> 00:00:39.829 
so first off you're going to want to set

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:42.939 
so first off you're going to want to set
priority<00:00:40.399> too<00:00:40.550> high<00:00:40.730> to<00:00:41.539> ensure<00:00:41.930> that<00:00:41.960> you're

00:00:42.939 --> 00:00:42.949 
priority too high to ensure that you're

00:00:42.949 --> 00:00:45.000 
priority too high to ensure that you're
getting<00:00:43.100> maximum<00:00:43.640> performance<00:00:43.940> out<00:00:44.510> of<00:00:44.539> your

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:45.010 
getting maximum performance out of your

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:49.750 
getting maximum performance out of your
computer<00:00:46.010> for<00:00:46.190> Minecraft<00:00:46.750> alright<00:00:47.750> and<00:00:48.760> on

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:49.760 
computer for Minecraft alright and on

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:51.970 
computer for Minecraft alright and on
the<00:00:50.510> option<00:00:50.899> list<00:00:51.079> for<00:00:51.260> you<00:00:51.410> it<00:00:51.590> should<00:00:51.829> say

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:51.980 
the option list for you it should say

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:54.549 
the option list for you it should say
set<00:00:52.280> affinity<00:00:52.809> the<00:00:53.809> reason<00:00:54.079> why<00:00:54.199> it<00:00:54.260> doesn't

00:00:54.549 --> 00:00:54.559 
set affinity the reason why it doesn't

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:56.709 
set affinity the reason why it doesn't
show<00:00:54.679> up<00:00:54.710> for<00:00:54.829> me<00:00:55.100> is<00:00:55.309> because<00:00:56.000> I'm<00:00:56.390> running

00:00:56.709 --> 00:00:56.719 
show up for me is because I'm running

00:00:56.719 --> 00:01:00.279 
show up for me is because I'm running
Windows<00:00:57.079> off<00:00:57.350> of<00:00:57.620> my<00:00:58.070> mac<00:00:58.309> on<00:00:58.609> parallels<00:00:59.510> so<00:01:00.260> I

00:01:00.279 --> 00:01:00.289 
Windows off of my mac on parallels so I

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:03.240 
Windows off of my mac on parallels so I
only<00:01:00.500> have<00:01:00.739> one<00:01:01.039> processor<00:01:01.670> running<00:01:01.850> windows

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:03.250 
only have one processor running windows

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:07.450 
only have one processor running windows
set<00:01:04.250> affinity<00:01:04.700> what<00:01:05.330> it<00:01:05.450> does<00:01:05.660> is<00:01:06.190> select<00:01:07.190> how

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:07.460 
set affinity what it does is select how

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:10.090 
set affinity what it does is select how
many<00:01:08.230> processors<00:01:09.230> you<00:01:09.440> want<00:01:09.710> to<00:01:09.890> run

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:10.100 
many processors you want to run

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:13.330 
many processors you want to run
minecraft<00:01:10.580> so<00:01:11.270> if<00:01:11.960> you<00:01:12.410> have<00:01:12.530> four<00:01:12.770> processors

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:13.340 
minecraft so if you have four processors

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:14.890 
minecraft so if you have four processors
you're<00:01:13.820> going<00:01:13.940> to<00:01:14.000> want<00:01:14.120> to<00:01:14.180> check<00:01:14.480> off<00:01:14.690> of

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:14.900 
you're going to want to check off of

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:17.620 
you're going to want to check off of
three<00:01:15.260> of<00:01:15.290> the<00:01:15.500> boxes<00:01:15.950> to<00:01:16.670> only<00:01:17.150> have<00:01:17.390> one

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:17.630 
three of the boxes to only have one

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:19.570 
three of the boxes to only have one
processor<00:01:18.200> run<00:01:18.380> it<00:01:18.530> if<00:01:18.740> you<00:01:19.220> have<00:01:19.340> two

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:19.580 
processor run it if you have two

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:20.950 
processor run it if you have two
processors<00:01:20.210> you're<00:01:20.480> going<00:01:20.600> to<00:01:20.660> want<00:01:20.750> to<00:01:20.810> only

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:20.960 
processors you're going to want to only

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:22.690 
processors you're going to want to only
check<00:01:21.170> up<00:01:21.320> one<00:01:21.530> of<00:01:21.650> the<00:01:21.710> boxes<00:01:22.070> to<00:01:22.370> have<00:01:22.490> one

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:22.700 
check up one of the boxes to have one

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:25.630 
check up one of the boxes to have one
processor<00:01:23.240> run<00:01:23.390> it<00:01:24.070> with<00:01:25.070> these<00:01:25.280> two

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:25.640 
processor run it with these two

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:27.940 
processor run it with these two
adjustments<00:01:26.470> minecraft<00:01:27.470> should<00:01:27.710> run<00:01:27.920> a

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:27.950 
adjustments minecraft should run a

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:30.700 
adjustments minecraft should run a
little<00:01:28.130> bit<00:01:28.310> faster<00:01:28.520> for<00:01:28.970> you<00:01:29.200> of<00:01:30.200> course<00:01:30.530> you

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:30.710 
little bit faster for you of course you

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:31.690 
little bit faster for you of course you
know<00:01:30.860> if<00:01:30.980> you<00:01:31.100> want<00:01:31.250> to<00:01:31.310> make<00:01:31.430> it<00:01:31.520> a<00:01:31.580> little

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:31.700 
know if you want to make it a little

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:33.640 
know if you want to make it a little
faster<00:01:31.910> you<00:01:32.270> can<00:01:32.300> change<00:01:32.660> graphics<00:01:33.200> too<00:01:33.380> fast

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:33.650 
faster you can change graphics too fast

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:35.950 
faster you can change graphics too fast
or<00:01:34.070> you<00:01:34.130> can<00:01:34.280> change<00:01:34.520> the<00:01:34.730> render<00:01:34.910> to<00:01:35.150> tiny

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:35.960 
or you can change the render to tiny

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:38.620 
or you can change the render to tiny
instead<00:01:36.500> of<00:01:36.590> far<00:01:36.830> but<00:01:37.670> if<00:01:37.910> that<00:01:38.150> doesn't<00:01:38.180> cut

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:38.630 
instead of far but if that doesn't cut

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:41.500 
instead of far but if that doesn't cut
it<00:01:38.780> there<00:01:39.380> is<00:01:39.500> a<00:01:39.530> mod<00:01:39.860> called<00:01:39.910> optifine<00:01:40.910> which

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:41.510 
it there is a mod called optifine which

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:43.150 
it there is a mod called optifine which
has<00:01:41.750> way<00:01:42.110> more<00:01:42.140> settings<00:01:42.770> that<00:01:42.920> you<00:01:42.950> can

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:43.160 
has way more settings that you can

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:46.270 
has way more settings that you can
adjust<00:01:43.280> and<00:01:43.970> you<00:01:44.780> can<00:01:44.960> increase<00:01:45.200> FPS<00:01:45.920> quite<00:01:46.250> a

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:46.280 
adjust and you can increase FPS quite a

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:49.210 
adjust and you can increase FPS quite a
lot<00:01:46.550> so<00:01:47.330> if<00:01:47.690> you're<00:01:48.380> interested<00:01:48.500> in<00:01:48.830> that<00:01:48.980> I'll
