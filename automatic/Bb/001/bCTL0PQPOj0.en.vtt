00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
 I'm going to show a lot today. 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:08.730
 especially to stick two books together 

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.769
 inseparable without using anything at all 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:14.160
 in fact I'm going to use something very 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:15.210
 very simple a little bit of 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.279
 stand credit 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:20.340
 but that simple piece of crepe tape 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:22.619
 will help me to stick the two books of 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:25.439
 so that two very strong people 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:27.599
 pulling the two sides can not 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:29.460
 separate the two books 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.140
 today I am not in the mood to destroy two 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.110
 books so I brought something here 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:38.100
 very rare and you probably will not 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:40.680
 see more is called phonebook this 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:43.170
 phone book that has 1200 pages I 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.280
 I'm going to cut right in the middle to do 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.100
 two books 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:50.010
 so here I have two books of 600 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:53.270
 pages each and I'll fix these 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:56.520
 two books so that they become one 

00:00:53.270 --> 00:01:04.680
 separable only takes a look at how 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:14.750
 if you make a droid 3 212 213 with 181 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:17.640
 points 182 to 599 600 missing a sheet 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:20.850
 you may not believe but these two 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:24.000
 lists not completely glued together are 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.920
 true Siamese sister and to us 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.280
 test to see if they do not separate 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:31.470
 really do two holes with 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:38.400
 Drill that's right in the corner. 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:40.259
 I'll pass a rope on each side before 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:43.290
 to call a friend to test 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:45.060
 I'm going to use that little bit of tape that 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:47.490
 I said I was going to use it at the beginning of the video 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:54.990
 is simply for the book will stay 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:58.110
 I'm so going to operate on top and so here 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:00.469
 below and now it's time to take the test 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.469
 force 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:27.290
 after that effort all athletes 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:30.740
 asking how does this list 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:31.280
 phone has taken so much strength from both 

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:33.710
 sides 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:36.320
 this happens because of the friction here 

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:37.640
 has 600 sheets is 1200 pages viewed 

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:39.620
 600 sheets 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:43.130
 if we add the whole area of ​​friction 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:45.140
 of these 600 sheets will give 32 meters 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:46.550
 square which is practically the size 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:49.280
 in the studio 

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:51.620
 the manual of the world then the friction generated 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:53.450
 here the leaves of the list is more or less 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:55.280
 as if we had two canvases of 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:56.390
 giant brake of 32 square meters 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:58.160
 each one 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:00.860
 put one against the other and try 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:03.470
 separate and there the friction generated here 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:06.410
 is so great that even two people 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:09.890
 push with full force on both sides 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:11.630
 you can not separate more experience with 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:15.010
 this crisis is only found in the next 

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:15.010
 Tuesday the blog 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:33.360
