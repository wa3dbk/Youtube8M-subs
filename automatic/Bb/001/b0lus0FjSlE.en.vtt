the<00:05:20.270> next<00:05:20.509> one<00:05:20.690> and<00:05:20.900> then<00:05:21.680> continue<00:05:22.160> that

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:22.370 
the next one and then continue that

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:30.129

pattern<00:05:22.580> around<00:05:23.000> to<00:05:23.419> one<00:05:23.660> to<00:05:24.110> one<00:05:24.139> to<00:05:24.349> it<00:05:29.139> so

00:05:30.129 --> 00:05:30.139 
pattern around to one to one to it so

00:05:30.139 --> 00:05:31.990 
pattern around to one to one to it so
this<00:05:30.349> round<00:05:30.590> you<00:05:30.919> should<00:05:30.949> have<00:05:31.130> twenty-four

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:32.000 
this round you should have twenty-four

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.870 
this round you should have twenty-four
and<00:05:32.650> we're<00:05:33.650> just<00:05:33.770> increasing<00:05:34.400> six<00:05:34.699> stitches

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:34.880 
and we're just increasing six stitches

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:37.089 
and we're just increasing six stitches
every<00:05:35.300> round<00:05:35.990> so<00:05:36.169> just<00:05:36.470> make<00:05:36.650> sure<00:05:36.860> your

00:05:37.089 --> 00:05:37.099 
every round so just make sure your

00:05:37.099 --> 00:05:38.680 
every round so just make sure your
stitch<00:05:37.400> count<00:05:37.699> is<00:05:37.849> correct<00:05:38.240> and<00:05:38.389> you<00:05:38.479> should

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:38.690 
stitch count is correct and you should

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:46.450 
stitch count is correct and you should

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:46.460 
be good all right you can see the spiral

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:49.839 
be good all right you can see the spiral
forming<00:05:47.650> okay<00:05:48.650> for<00:05:48.860> the<00:05:48.949> next<00:05:48.979> round

00:05:49.839 --> 00:05:49.849 
forming okay for the next round

00:05:49.849 --> 00:05:55.900 
forming okay for the next round
you're<00:05:50.240> going<00:05:50.360> to<00:05:50.419> work<00:05:50.599> 2<00:05:51.190> 1<00:05:52.190> 1<00:05:52.550> 1<00:05:52.970> 2<00:05:53.900> 1<00:05:54.199> 1<00:05:54.470> 1<00:05:54.910> the

00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:55.910 
you're going to work 2 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 the

00:05:55.910 --> 00:05:58.480 
you're going to work 2 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 the
next<00:05:56.240> round<00:05:56.389> after<00:05:56.570> that<00:05:56.720> you'll<00:05:57.110> work<00:05:57.259> to<00:05:57.590> 1<00:05:58.160> 1

00:05:58.480 --> 00:05:58.490 
next round after that you'll work to 1 1

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:01.930 
next round after that you'll work to 1 1
1<00:05:58.669> 1<00:05:59.240> and<00:05:59.560> on<00:06:00.560> and<00:06:00.770> on<00:06:00.889> you're<00:06:01.160> increasing<00:06:01.430> 6

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:01.940 
1 1 and on and on you're increasing 6

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:04.029 
1 1 and on and on you're increasing 6
stitches<00:06:02.210> each<00:06:03.080> round<00:06:03.440> so<00:06:03.650> that<00:06:03.740> the<00:06:03.830> number

00:06:04.029 --> 00:06:04.039 
stitches each round so that the number

00:06:04.039 --> 00:06:06.730 
stitches each round so that the number
of<00:06:04.130> single<00:06:04.580> stitches<00:06:04.960> will<00:06:05.960> get<00:06:06.320> greater<00:06:06.560> and

00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:06.740 
of single stitches will get greater and

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:09.850 
of single stitches will get greater and
greater<00:06:06.919> okay<00:06:07.699> to<00:06:07.759> finish<00:06:08.030> off<00:06:08.740> you're<00:06:09.740> gonna

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:09.860 
greater okay to finish off you're gonna

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:14.020 
greater okay to finish off you're gonna
work<00:06:10.069> to<00:06:10.819> slip<00:06:11.569> stitches<00:06:12.220> like<00:06:13.220> so<00:06:13.520> if<00:06:13.970> you

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:14.030 
work to slip stitches like so if you

00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:17.830 
work to slip stitches like so if you
missed<00:06:14.300> that<00:06:15.370> reach<00:06:16.370> through<00:06:16.789> grab<00:06:17.060> your

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:17.840 
missed that reach through grab your

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:20.040 
missed that reach through grab your
roving<00:06:18.229> and<00:06:18.349> pull<00:06:18.560> it<00:06:18.680> through<00:06:18.710> both<00:06:19.099> loops

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:20.050 
roving and pull it through both loops

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:22.020 
roving and pull it through both loops
tada

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:22.030 
tada

00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:25.149 
tada
okay<00:06:23.030> and<00:06:23.210> then<00:06:23.360> just<00:06:23.599> pull<00:06:23.840> that<00:06:24.110> up<00:06:24.169> now

00:06:25.149 --> 00:06:25.159 
okay and then just pull that up now

00:06:25.159 --> 00:06:28.209 
okay and then just pull that up now
here's<00:06:25.460> how<00:06:25.699> you<00:06:26.120> hide<00:06:26.389> your<00:06:26.780> end<00:06:27.009> go<00:06:28.009> ahead

00:06:28.209 --> 00:06:28.219 
here's how you hide your end go ahead

00:06:28.219 --> 00:06:30.730 
here's how you hide your end go ahead
and<00:06:28.370> push<00:06:28.820> that<00:06:28.849> tail<00:06:29.360> through<00:06:30.050> the<00:06:30.229> side<00:06:30.500> of

00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:30.740 
and push that tail through the side of

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:34.420 
and push that tail through the side of
the<00:06:30.860> next<00:06:31.099> loop<00:06:31.310> like<00:06:31.550> so<00:06:31.849> and<00:06:32.979> then<00:06:33.979> poke<00:06:34.280> it

00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:34.430 
the next loop like so and then poke it

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:37.180 
the next loop like so and then poke it
back<00:06:34.460> down<00:06:34.820> from<00:06:35.180> whence<00:06:35.479> it<00:06:35.659> came<00:06:35.840> and<00:06:36.190> that

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:37.190 
back down from whence it came and that

00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:39.490 
back down from whence it came and that
creates<00:06:37.490> a<00:06:37.610> fake<00:06:38.060> loop<00:06:38.389> so<00:06:38.960> it<00:06:39.080> looks<00:06:39.229> like<00:06:39.320> it

00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:39.500 
creates a fake loop so it looks like it

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:41.290 
creates a fake loop so it looks like it
just<00:06:39.530> blends<00:06:39.949> in<00:06:40.159> seamlessly<00:06:40.370> with<00:06:40.909> the<00:06:40.940> rest

00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:41.300 
just blends in seamlessly with the rest

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:46.990 
just blends in seamlessly with the rest
of<00:06:41.479> the<00:06:41.599> edge<00:06:45.219> alright<00:06:46.219> now<00:06:46.400> for<00:06:46.460> the<00:06:46.669> ends

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:47.000 
of the edge alright now for the ends

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.720 
of the edge alright now for the ends
just<00:06:47.210> we<00:06:47.449> women<00:06:47.719> on<00:06:47.840> the<00:06:47.960> back<00:06:48.110> side

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:50.730 

00:06:50.730 --> 00:06:53.460 

and<00:06:51.730> that's<00:06:51.970> it<00:06:52.390> you<00:06:52.630> can<00:06:52.750> make<00:06:52.900> the<00:06:53.050> rug<00:06:53.260> as

00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:53.470 
and that's it you can make the rug as

00:06:53.470 --> 00:06:55.140 
and that's it you can make the rug as
big<00:06:53.680> as<00:06:53.800> you<00:06:53.890> like<00:06:53.920> mine's<00:06:54.370> three<00:06:54.670> feet<00:06:54.910> across

00:06:55.140 --> 00:06:55.150 
big as you like mine's three feet across

00:06:55.150 --> 00:06:57.150 
big as you like mine's three feet across
and<00:06:55.570> it<00:06:55.690> took<00:06:55.840> seven<00:06:56.170> and<00:06:56.290> a<00:06:56.320> half<00:06:56.350> pounds<00:06:56.770> of

00:06:57.150 --> 00:06:57.160 
and it took seven and a half pounds of

00:06:57.160 --> 00:07:00.030 
and it took seven and a half pounds of
roving<00:06:57.910> so<00:06:58.330> I<00:06:58.570> hope<00:06:58.870> you<00:06:58.960> liked<00:06:59.110> this<00:06:59.320> video<00:06:59.530> if
