know I keep stressing that but in so

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:37.800 
know I keep stressing that but in so
many<00:02:36.459> ways<00:02:36.730> this<00:02:36.970> is<00:02:37.060> a<00:02:37.150> big<00:02:37.390> leap<00:02:37.510> forward

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
many ways this is a big leap forward
