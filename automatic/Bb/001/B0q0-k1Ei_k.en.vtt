00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:06.499
 hello friends i am basilio way and in 

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:08.450
 this tutorial today I'm going to teach you 

00:00:06.499 --> 00:00:12.630
 how to correctly use the new 

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:14.250
 sl 2.0 application 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:17.490
 once already within the application 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:19.270
 we have to give the beautiful top 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.910
 left 

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:25.240
 after that we have to enable where 

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:27.640
 says load http down we will leave a 

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:31.080
 unique ip address which is what we have 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:33.630
 what to put in our computer 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:36.239
 once put the ip address in 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:39.960
 our browser will open the window 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:42.829
 of bcl saying that we take the rows 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:45.769
 in this case it would be the videos 

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:48.109
 we have to give it where it says upload 

00:00:45.769 --> 00:00:50.749
 files and we just select 

00:00:48.109 --> 00:00:53.120
 our preferences file fits 

00:00:50.749 --> 00:00:56.719
 emphasize that sl reproduces any 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:59.700
 type of video can be as much as a 

00:00:56.719 --> 00:01:01.770
 movie or a home video 

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:03.810
 now we have to wait for our 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:06.720
 file is added to our device 

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:09.450
 this process is pretty fast but 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:12.100
 It also depends on the type of file and the 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:14.290
 speed of our internet 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:16.780
 once you have uploaded the file times 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:21.570
 input that already our file 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:21.570
 sample was transmitted correctly 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.119
 after the file has been uploaded 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.909
 correctly we can go to our 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:32.100
 device and if the video simply does not 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:34.469
 appears we can exit the application and 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:37.409
 re-enter after that we'll see that 

00:01:34.469 --> 00:01:39.770
 we already have our file or video and it 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:43.210
 will play almost instantaneously 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:45.600
 because the previous process that we did 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:49.200
 send the file of our computer 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.200
 directly to our 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:20.819
 once already within less video 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:23.550
 we can change several options of the 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:26.400
 movie either looking for the video 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:29.490
 saturating with the range the contrast the 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:30.750
 brightness we can change up to the 

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:33.690
 playback speed of the 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:35.240
 movie and adjust the size of the 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:36.520
 movie on our screen 

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:39.190
 device 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:42.910
 these are the most basic functions already 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:45.760
 is bcl 2.0 comes loaded with other 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:48.250
 news that synchronize our 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:50.320
 dropbox account to play 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:52.270
 our multimedia content once 

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:54.220
 Input Session 

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:56.500
 good friends until here was mine today 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:58.990
 I hope you liked it and that it's 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:01.840
 useful if you have questions or questions the 

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:04.920
 can leave in the comments and we 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:04.920
