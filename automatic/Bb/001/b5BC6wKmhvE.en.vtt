00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.220
 Hi guys, I 'm already doing the 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:09.960
 my daily makeup that is this 

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:12.540
 that I think we and I think 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.460
 natural and a little healthier for the 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.590
 your skin because we are everyday 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:19.910
 if the ankle I do not like it very much 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:23.369
 it's very much made up then west boss 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:45.030
 So girls, how are you waiting? 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:47.280
 to dry when seriously mother I think it's a 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.500
 person who likes to go out with makeup 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:52.590
 during the day obviously 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:55.500
 It was a party and a clear lie reason. 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.940
 No, but I'll give it a little bit 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.250
 more makeup attention but 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:02.579
 usually I 'm not careful 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:04.500
 I 'll tell you then I 'll pass it on to you. 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:08.729
 my step by step makeup that 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:14.670
 area that is the nickname as a natural good 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:17.220
 zinha so I'm nothing I do not 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:19.259
 be 100 and close with you are seeing 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.540
 I started having to go unchallenged the 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:24.270
 work this beautiful sunscreen 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:28.530
 doing it is very good because besides 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:30.570
 protect and moisturize the skin it is already 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.729
 jacob a little because he is skin color 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:36.829
 how are you seeing why I 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:36.829
 I expect a bad speculative move 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:48.399
 I do not see this makes you happy, it's a little bit 

00:01:43.329 --> 00:01:50.350
 I like to spend my my goal 

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:52.030
 is this one not like when his eye 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:54.039
 0 pastel kiss 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:56.200
 obviously something that is clearer in the 

00:01:54.039 --> 00:02:00.189
 line ball like because I'm maybe 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:03.070
 mine and March mainly on the part 

00:02:00.189 --> 00:02:07.720
 lower part of the eye because I feel that I 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:10.110
 I have a lot of or a lot of scorn I 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:10.110
 I know how it is 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:20.650
 I may even though the goal is 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:28.480
 always likes it spreads and also by 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:31.690
 this area that the baby's face does not 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:33.610
 stay a thing a lot way 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:37.180

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:41.310

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:41.310

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:48.430
 then make the sauce analyzes the area and 

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:50.530
 in the exit of a to cover a little bit 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:51.820

 My girl home so I always 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:05.890

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:12.100

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:36.420

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:39.410

00:03:54.990 --> 00:04:00.120
 more propensity brasÃ­lia which begin to 

00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:04.830
 be lifted a little flawed and I 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:08.070
 I use this in the jungle eyebrow beyond 

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:11.730
