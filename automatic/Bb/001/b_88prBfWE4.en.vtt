00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.620
 Hi, I'm Sunday from your workshop 

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:16.449
 DIY good in the previous video 

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:18.130
 We begin the manufacturing process 

00:00:16.449 --> 00:00:20.890
 what we are seeing is a template 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:22.449
 to put dowels spikes if you 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:24.759
 you lost the first part and want to take 

00:00:22.449 --> 00:00:26.990
 At a glance I leave a link in the part 

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:29.180
 upper left 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:32.300
 in this second part we are going to open a 

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:35.030
 hole on the side of the template where 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:36.950
 matches the professor of wood and 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:39.800
 then we will do some tests to see how 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:41.960
 we have stayed 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:44.480
 we started to mark the place where 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:47.059
 place the bushes according to the 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:49.970
 thickness of the wood and the diameter of the 

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:52.870
 So, these measures, I'm going to leave you 

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:57.190
 of DIY dotcom you will have a link 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:59.140
 to the article in the description of the video 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:02.079
 and how he has been able to measure to work more 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:04.420
 comfortable I have chosen to disarm the other 

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:06.880
 part of the staff to do the 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:10.150
 brands what we are seeing the same thing and 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:11.259
 then drilling holes in the end 

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:12.990
 What do we have to do? 

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:15.509
 here and others 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.250
 ok we start to open the holes with 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:18.720
 the bit of the right diameter in 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.540
 function of the cap that we are going to 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.729
 place if you want to have more detail 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:26.119
 how to do this do not miss the first 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:28.350
 video I explain it as entertainment 

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:30.090
 to not serve this video too much 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.950
 long 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.750
 and once we have the hole opened 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.329
 we just have to present the 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:40.020
 cap that we are going to place some 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:43.189
 light blows with the hammer and so 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.189
 we will place in your site 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:48.910
 ok let's perform the same operation 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:50.260
 of the hole we make hole with the drill 

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:52.210
 adequate the cap that we are going to 

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:54.040
 place and then we put the cap 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:56.290
 and we give a few light blows with the 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:02:00.190
 hammer and here we have the result 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:02.980
 final we already have the side of the 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:06.360
 template where we make the holes in 

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:08.619
 the thickness of the wood for the plugs 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:10.990
 ones that be alive concrete that 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:15.370
 we had wished you have in my case 

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:18.520
 opted for the 4 6 and 8 for thicknesses 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:20.620
 of 10 16 and 19 millimeters thick in the 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:22.030
 wood in this way all the details 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:24.970
 the you have in your DIY 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:26.560
 good dotcom and this way already 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:29.140
 we will have finished the template 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:31.810
 Here we can see it is simple 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:35.100
 perform the most complicated are the 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:37.750
 measures is to say that the measures are 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:39.730
 adjusted to the thickness of the wood that 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:41.500
 my case is 15 millimeters with which 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:43.900
 I on a wood you passed the template 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:45.880
 with different thicknesses of 15 millimeters 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:47.950
 I probably have to adjust a little 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:49.550
 This measure for the placement of 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:51.890
 caps 

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:53.860
 for the placement of the plugs in 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:56.170
 last instance 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:58.810
 well let's go with the test there we have what 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:01.450
 what we want to do in this case the 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:03.730
 proof I'm going to make it for a wood with 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:06.820
 a thickness of 16 a must be plasticized in 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:08.470
 white and to place 6-pegs for 

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:10.090
 the Union 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:12.310
 The first thing we have to do is 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:16.270
 mark how far we want to open the 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:17.950
 edge side hole and once 

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:19.960
 that we have clear at what distance what 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:22.720
 we must open is to present the template 

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:24.640
 insert the drill bit and make the hole and 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:26.560
 we have it we have to be careful with 

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:29.680
 the depth that we give to the hole 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:32.230
 on the east side we make the hole in 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:34.990
 the thickness of the wood is not so 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:37.780
 important but if on the other side 

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:39.610
 then we see it and there we have what 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:41.440
 we are looking for an already open part 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:44.830
 of the thickness of the wood we have it 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:46.780
 open to place the tarugo spike and 

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:49.590
 now we make the mark on the other wood 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:53.010
 to get the slope we have it 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:55.900
 we make the brand and using the template 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:57.370
 we drill here on this side of the 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:59.140
 wood that we are going to join with the other is 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:02.170
 where we have to take into account the 

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:05.080
 depth so as not to pierce the wood 

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:07.690
 in this case it is 16 

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:11.050
 then the maximum depth in half to 

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:12.790
 a little more maybe but without getting past 

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:15.430
 because we drill the wood and put 

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:18.720
 of the risk of drilling the wood and 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:20.760
 make it make a through hole 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:24.000
 Well, he's already seeing how the 

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:25.890
 thing if we have already joined a wood with 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.740
 another one with a tarugo we obviously have 

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:30.319
 what to put 2 

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:32.750
 and here we already started to present 

00:04:30.319 --> 00:04:36.370
 mark where the other makes 

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:39.050
 hole so that it is well joined but 

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:41.270
 that is the idea that we can unite with a 

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:44.270
 single template join the two pieces of the 

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:45.920
 wood through of course spike 

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:48.410
 the procedure is always going to be the 

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:52.520
 same and remember on this side of the 

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:54.140
 wood that would cover ground or 

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:56.450
 good could be the laterals depends 

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:59.030
 of the position of the furniture we can not 

00:04:56.450 --> 00:05:01.520
 making the hole there is why it has 

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:03.530
 turned around without passing us is not the 

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:05.240
 through hole does not pass is not the 

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:07.460
 depth of 

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:09.920
 when inserting the bit so as not to 

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:12.430
 be the hole pretty 

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:14.660
 and here we have results there is 

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:18.110
 we stop joining the two pieces mind 

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:20.450
 spiral tarugo is a one template that 

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:23.360
 it makes it easier for us to place 

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:25.430
 the spikes or spikes 

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:27.710
 if you found the ticket interesting 

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:29.090
 I like it and share it subscribed to 

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:30.710
 channel to receive the new ones I'm going 

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:32.930
 doing it in addition to supporting my work 

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:34.879
 and all the details you have 

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:37.819
 DIY studies dotcom measurements 

00:05:34.879 --> 00:05:40.360
 and a greeting and until next time 

00:05:37.819 --> 00:05:40.360
 video
