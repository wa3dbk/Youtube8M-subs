has some groove marks on there bite

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.420 
has some groove marks on there bite
marks<00:01:03.870> what<00:01:04.019> I<00:01:04.049> like<00:01:04.229> to<00:01:04.320> call<00:01:04.470> them<00:01:04.650> from<00:01:05.400> the

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
marks what I like to call them from the

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.190 
marks what I like to call them from the
cymbals<00:01:05.909> and<00:01:06.090> from<00:01:06.330> doing<00:01:06.600> cross<00:01:06.810> sticking

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
cymbals and from doing cross sticking

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.620 
cymbals and from doing cross sticking
and<00:01:07.350> stuff<00:01:07.500> like<00:01:07.650> that<00:01:07.890> so<00:01:08.130> it<00:01:08.970> actually<00:01:09.210> gives

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
and stuff like that so it actually gives

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:20.020 
and stuff like that so it actually gives
a<00:01:09.930> little<00:01:10.110> more<00:01:10.229> attack<00:01:18.200> turn<00:01:19.200> it<00:01:19.320> over<00:01:19.439> a

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:20.030 
a little more attack turn it over a

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:28.450 
a little more attack turn it over a
smoother<00:01:21.979> pac-man<00:01:22.979> this<00:01:23.189> sound

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:28.460 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:31.340 

all<00:01:29.460> right<00:01:29.640> and<00:01:30.300> then<00:01:30.450> we're<00:01:30.990> going<00:01:31.110> to<00:01:31.170> do<00:01:31.260> is

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
all right and then we're going to do is

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.020 
all right and then we're going to do is

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
we're going to slowly start to bring the

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.930

00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:17.639 
fun and easy way to cook some new sounds

00:03:17.639 --> 00:03:19.610 
fun and easy way to cook some new sounds
out<00:03:17.909> of<00:03:17.939> your<00:03:18.120> drum<00:03:18.359> set<00:03:18.569> to<00:03:18.930> be<00:03:19.049> used<00:03:19.260> in<00:03:19.379> a<00:03:19.439> few

different situations anywhere from sound

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:24.979 
different situations anywhere from sound
effects<00:03:22.349> to<00:03:22.560> actual<00:03:23.280> grooves<00:03:24.090> trying<00:03:24.750> to<00:03:24.840> make

00:03:24.979 --> 00:03:24.989 
effects to actual grooves trying to make

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:26.780 
effects to actual grooves trying to make
it<00:03:25.139> sound<00:03:25.379> as<00:03:25.650> if<00:03:25.680> there's<00:03:25.950> a<00:03:26.010> filter<00:03:26.489> on<00:03:26.700> the

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790 
it sound as if there's a filter on the

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:28.339 
it sound as if there's a filter on the
groove<00:03:27.030> and<00:03:27.239> a<00:03:27.299> recording<00:03:27.750> filter<00:03:27.989> there's<00:03:28.200> so

00:03:28.339 --> 00:03:28.349 
groove and a recording filter there's so

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:30.470 
groove and a recording filter there's so
many<00:03:28.470> different<00:03:28.919> things<00:03:29.030> that<00:03:30.030> this<00:03:30.239> sound

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:30.480 
many different things that this sound

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:32.990 
many different things that this sound
can<00:03:30.689> kind<00:03:30.840> of<00:03:30.900> emulate<00:03:31.290> so<00:03:31.889> until<00:03:32.579> next<00:03:32.730> time

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 
can kind of emulate so until next time

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.240 
can kind of emulate so until next time
