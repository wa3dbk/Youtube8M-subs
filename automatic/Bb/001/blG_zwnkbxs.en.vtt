you my version of his night job but i'm
using<00:00:14.099> a<00:00:14.219> dot<00:00:14.460> tech<00:00:14.730> I<00:00:14.880> believe<00:00:15.150> this<00:00:15.299> is

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
using a dot tech I believe this is

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.050 
using a dot tech I believe this is
called<00:00:15.719> a<00:00:15.839> fire<00:00:16.470> strike<00:00:16.859> but<00:00:17.670> it's<00:00:17.820> exactly

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
called a fire strike but it's exactly

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:19.400 
called a fire strike but it's exactly
the<00:00:18.270> same<00:00:18.390> as<00:00:18.510> the<00:00:18.539> nite<00:00:18.750> finder<00:00:18.930> and<00:00:19.320> i'm

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
the same as the nite finder and i'm

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.939 
the same as the nite finder and i'm
using<00:00:19.680> a<00:00:19.740> Spitfire<00:00:20.160> instead<00:00:20.520> of<00:00:20.609> a<00:00:20.670> job<00:00:20.880> so

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:21.949 
using a Spitfire instead of a job so

00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:27.500 
using a Spitfire instead of a job so
fire<00:00:22.949> fire<00:00:23.250> Oh<00:00:24.109> or<00:00:25.109> uh<00:00:25.310> I<00:00:26.310> don't<00:00:26.519> know<00:00:26.699> spit
