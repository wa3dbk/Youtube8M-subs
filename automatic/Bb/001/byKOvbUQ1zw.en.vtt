00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:03.230
 of Mary 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:12.560
 my love 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:23.419
 is cutie short stories is a new 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:26.390
 species of shrew of the republic of 

00:00:23.419 --> 00:00:29.180
 Congo that is able to support the weight 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:32.269
 of a human being without any problem to the 

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:36.620
 look like this shrew is the only 

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:39.530
 mammal of the world that has a column 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:42.019
 vertebral reinforced four times more 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:45.079
 resistant in four times stronger 

00:00:42.019 --> 00:00:48.559
 that the human being's so strong is that 

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:51.080
 with only 150 grams of 50 to 150 

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:54.260
 grams that weighs this species that I just 

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:57.519
 to mention is able to support the 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:01:01.250
 One person's weight for 5 minutes 

00:00:57.519 --> 00:01:03.379
 without any difficulty for it 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:05.869
 those who discovered this same species 

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:09.500
 they tried it they got on top of the 

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:14.509
 shrew and endured a living being of 150 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:15.890
 grams 70 to 80 kilos of weight seems 

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:18.200
 unreal not 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:19.880
 in the end the case is that there in the 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:22.370
 lands in the homeland of this 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:25.850
 species many times you have been called as 

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:28.159
 the armored shrew of thor already fixed 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:29.840
 all the nicknames that have put some 

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:33.259
 they say that it's even like a kind of 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:35.840
 animal superhero because not only 

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:38.630
 it's about your resistance but that 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:41.020
 has the strength to catch logs a lot 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:43.460
 heavier than your body weight 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:46.130
 can get to pick up trunks of several 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:48.080
 kilos of weight without a doubt a mammal that 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:50.149
 it far surpasses beings 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:52.399
 humans if we had the 

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:53.940
 resistance of shrews and strength 

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:56.040
 of these 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:58.380
 nothing would happen to us by colliding with us 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:00.210
 a car at 100 kilometers per hour does not 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:04.350
 nothing would happen to us because we ran over 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:06.960
 a truck honestly would not happen to us 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:09.900
 nothing ever because your spine 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:12.870
 is the only animal kingdom that comes 

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:14.970
 reinforced by numerous sites 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:17.489
 it is a species that is not in danger of 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:20.400
 extinction due to its robustness to its 

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:22.379
 resistance and nowadays it has already 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:24.450
 discovered this new species of 

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:28.170
 shrew that promises to be the most 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:30.510
 resistant of all of them the world 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:34.610
 animal is undoubtedly a new world and 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:34.610
 curious that will always surprise us
