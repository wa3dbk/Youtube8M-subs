00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
stinks what's uh I guess poignant is is

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:29.810 
stinks what's uh I guess poignant is is
the<00:02:28.260> right<00:02:28.410> word<00:02:28.620> about<00:02:28.950> that<00:02:29.190> that<00:02:29.400> joke<00:02:29.610> is

the right word about that that joke is

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:31.880 
the right word about that that joke is
think<00:02:30.570> about<00:02:30.660> the<00:02:30.930> age<00:02:31.080> of<00:02:31.230> the<00:02:31.290> shuttle<00:02:31.680> fleet

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
think about the age of the shuttle fleet

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:34.490 
think about the age of the shuttle fleet
that<00:02:32.220> just<00:02:32.520> got<00:02:32.670> retired<00:02:33.090> the<00:02:34.050> the<00:02:34.290> mock

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
that just got retired the the mock

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:36.410 
that just got retired the the mock
shuttle<00:02:34.860> the<00:02:35.130> enterprise<00:02:35.640> I<00:02:35.970> think<00:02:36.210> that<00:02:36.330> was

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
shuttle the enterprise I think that was

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:39.680 
shuttle the enterprise I think that was
built<00:02:36.660> in<00:02:36.840> 76<00:02:37.590> or<00:02:37.770> 77<00:02:38.070> that's<00:02:38.790> right<00:02:39.000> the<00:02:39.480> first

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
built in 76 or 77 that's right the first

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:41.210 
built in 76 or 77 that's right the first
real<00:02:39.930> shuttle<00:02:40.230> to<00:02:40.320> Columbia<00:02:40.740> I<00:02:40.800> remember

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
real shuttle to Columbia I remember

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:43.820 
real shuttle to Columbia I remember
watching<00:02:41.370> that<00:02:41.580> fly<00:02:41.940> in<00:02:42.260> 1981<00:02:43.260> for<00:02:43.530> the<00:02:43.620> first

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:43.830 
watching that fly in 1981 for the first

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:47.090 
watching that fly in 1981 for the first
time<00:02:44.690> the<00:02:45.690> endeavor<00:02:46.110> that<00:02:46.230> endeavor<00:02:46.860> was<00:02:47.040> a

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:47.100 
time the endeavor that endeavor was a

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:49.100 
time the endeavor that endeavor was a
youngest<00:02:47.490> one<00:02:47.700> I<00:02:47.970> think<00:02:48.360> that<00:02:48.540> was<00:02:48.720> built<00:02:48.960> in

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.110 
youngest one I think that was built in

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:51.590 
youngest one I think that was built in
the<00:02:49.140> early<00:02:49.380> 90s<00:02:50.010> so<00:02:50.190> 20<00:02:50.490> years<00:02:50.670> old<00:02:50.850> we<00:02:51.480> were

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:51.600 
the early 90s so 20 years old we were

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.660 
the early 90s so 20 years old we were
setting<00:02:51.870> men<00:02:52.170> and<00:02:52.320> women<00:02:52.590> into<00:02:52.890> space<00:02:53.130> in<00:02:53.370> in

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
setting men and women into space in in

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:57.440

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
it's younger than the endeavor and I

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:00.650 
it's younger than the endeavor and I
think<00:02:59.400> go<00:02:59.490> to<00:02:59.550> I<00:02:59.640> don't<00:03:00.030> go<00:03:00.210> any<00:03:00.330> farther<00:03:00.480> than
