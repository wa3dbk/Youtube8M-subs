00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:07.630 
structures that just visually make the

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:09.360 
structures that just visually make the
place<00:01:07.840> look<00:01:08.080> a<00:01:08.170> little<00:01:08.290> bit<00:01:08.470> nicer<00:01:08.590> and<00:01:09.010> this

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:09.370 
place look a little bit nicer and this

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:12.120 
place look a little bit nicer and this
is<00:01:09.520> what<00:01:09.670> this<00:01:09.850> mod<00:01:10.090> does<00:01:10.120> so<00:01:10.810> for<00:01:11.500> example<00:01:11.920> in

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:12.130 
is what this mod does so for example in

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:15.330 
is what this mod does so for example in
a<00:01:12.310> standard<00:01:12.940> kind<00:01:13.180> of<00:01:13.360> you<00:01:13.630> know<00:01:13.750> normal<00:01:14.340> stony

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:15.340 
a standard kind of you know normal stony

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:17.310 
a standard kind of you know normal stony
bit<00:01:15.670> or<00:01:15.820> whatever<00:01:16.090> it'll<00:01:16.930> look<00:01:16.990> a<00:01:17.050> little<00:01:17.170> bit

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:17.320 
bit or whatever it'll look a little bit

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:19.950 
bit or whatever it'll look a little bit
like<00:01:17.410> this<00:01:17.700> so<00:01:18.700> it's<00:01:18.910> not<00:01:19.000> too<00:01:19.300> overpowered

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:19.960 
like this so it's not too overpowered

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:21.240 
like this so it's not too overpowered
which<00:01:20.110> is<00:01:20.230> really<00:01:20.470> nice<00:01:20.620> however<00:01:20.920> there's<00:01:21.220> a

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:21.250 
which is really nice however there's a

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:22.890

anyway<00:01:42.550> you<00:01:42.760> have<00:01:43.180> these<00:01:43.420> fellow<00:01:44.020> stalagmites

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:44.650 
anyway you have these fellow stalagmites

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:47.130 
anyway you have these fellow stalagmites
and<00:01:44.920> stalactites<00:01:45.180> and<00:01:46.180> which<00:01:46.600> can<00:01:46.870> come<00:01:47.110> from

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:47.140 
and stalactites and which can come from

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:49.500 
and stalactites and which can come from
the<00:01:47.500> floor<00:01:47.770> or<00:01:48.040> from<00:01:48.310> the<00:01:48.430> ceiling<00:01:48.790> and<00:01:48.970> I<00:01:49.450> do

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:49.510 
the floor or from the ceiling and I do

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:50.880 
the floor or from the ceiling and I do
actually<00:01:49.720> believe<00:01:49.990> they<00:01:50.290> they<00:01:50.710> might

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:50.890 
actually believe they they might

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:53.760 
actually believe they they might
actually<00:01:51.070> grow<00:01:51.430> with<00:01:51.760> time<00:01:52.060> because<00:01:53.020> if<00:01:53.620> they

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:53.770 
actually grow with time because if they

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:55.260 
actually grow with time because if they
do<00:01:53.830> that's<00:01:54.160> really<00:01:54.670> really<00:01:54.880> cool<00:01:55.030> but<00:01:55.150> this

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:55.270 
do that's really really cool but this

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:56.640 
do that's really really cool but this
one<00:01:55.480> looks<00:01:55.690> slightly<00:01:55.900> longer<00:01:56.230> than<00:01:56.380> other

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:56.650 
one looks slightly longer than other

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:58.740 
one looks slightly longer than other
ones<00:01:56.860> I've<00:01:57.070> seen<00:01:57.100> so<00:01:57.670> possibly<00:01:58.330> they<00:01:58.540> might

00:01:58.740 --> 00:01:58.750 
ones I've seen so possibly they might

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:00.150 
ones I've seen so possibly they might
grow<00:01:58.960> which<00:01:59.110> is<00:01:59.140> a<00:01:59.260> very<00:01:59.530> very<00:01:59.680> cool<00:01:59.890> feature

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:00.160 
grow which is a very very cool feature

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:02.400 
grow which is a very very cool feature
but<00:02:01.060> yeah<00:02:01.180> you<00:02:01.420> also<00:02:01.540> get<00:02:01.870> like<00:02:01.990> things<00:02:02.260> like

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:02.410 
but yeah you also get like things like

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:04.050 
but yeah you also get like things like
this<00:02:02.590> which<00:02:02.800> are<00:02:02.980> mushrooms<00:02:03.460> now<00:02:03.730> these<00:02:03.850> are

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:04.060 
this which are mushrooms now these are

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:10.090 
little bit bright here so it's kind of

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:14.430 
little bit bright here so it's kind of

00:03:14.949 --> 00:03:14.959 
this is kind of what the caves will look

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:16.809 
this is kind of what the caves will look
like<00:03:15.140> when<00:03:15.350> you<00:03:15.500> walk<00:03:15.680> through<00:03:15.709> them<00:03:16.190> have

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:18.560 
stalagmites and stalactite you have the

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:21.550 
stalagmites and stalactite you have the
water<00:03:18.860> these<00:03:19.519> are<00:03:19.580> special<00:03:20.030> ice<00:03:20.209> I<00:03:20.569> sell<00:03:21.080> ice

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:21.560 
water these are special ice I sell ice

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:24.110 
kind of like icicles likes icicles

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:26.670 
kind of like icicles likes icicles
that's<00:03:24.860> kind<00:03:25.069> of<00:03:25.100> little<00:03:25.730> bit<00:03:25.819> weird<00:03:25.970> as<00:03:26.180> a

kind of stuff but yeah just just wanted

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:33.789 
kind of stuff but yeah just just wanted
to<00:03:32.720> kind<00:03:32.870> of<00:03:32.900> show<00:03:33.079> you<00:03:33.140> a<00:03:33.200> few<00:03:33.440> more<00:03:33.620> of<00:03:33.739> them

00:03:33.789 --> 00:03:33.799 
to kind of show you a few more of them

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:36.069 
to kind of show you a few more of them
really<00:03:34.070> because<00:03:34.250> this<00:03:34.430> is<00:03:34.670> the<00:03:35.329> full<00:03:35.660> array<00:03:36.049> of

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:36.079 
really because this is the full array of

00:03:36.079 --> 00:03:38.380 
really because this is the full array of
them<00:03:36.500> so<00:03:36.829> for<00:03:37.220> example<00:03:37.640> here<00:03:37.880> stalagmites

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:38.390 
them so for example here stalagmites

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:41.110 
them so for example here stalagmites
Telex<00:03:38.840> heights<00:03:39.110> oh<00:03:39.549> that's<00:03:40.549> kind<00:03:40.850> of<00:03:40.910> that's

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:41.120 
Telex heights oh that's kind of that's

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:43.420 
Telex heights oh that's kind of that's
probably<00:03:41.329> like<00:03:41.630> a<00:03:41.690> one-block<00:03:42.110> space<00:03:42.620> so<00:03:43.190> yeah

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:43.430 
probably like a one-block space so yeah

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:45.190 
probably like a one-block space so yeah
as<00:03:43.489> you<00:03:43.640> can<00:03:43.760> see<00:03:43.970> and<00:03:44.239> they<00:03:44.810> all<00:03:44.959> come<00:03:45.140> in

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:45.200 
as you can see and they all come in

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:46.479 
as you can see and they all come in
different<00:03:45.380> sizes<00:03:45.680> they<00:03:46.040> also<00:03:46.160> come<00:03:46.370> in

00:03:46.479 --> 00:03:46.489 
different sizes they also come in

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:48.220 
different sizes they also come in
different<00:03:46.519> styles<00:03:47.299> so<00:03:47.390> for<00:03:47.690> example<00:03:48.079> these

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:48.230 
different styles so for example these

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:50.410 
different styles so for example these
are<00:03:48.290> sandstone<00:03:49.070> ones<00:03:49.280> now<00:03:49.760> these<00:03:49.910> will<00:03:50.150> form

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:50.420 
are sandstone ones now these will form

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:52.180 
are sandstone ones now these will form
in<00:03:50.720> sort<00:03:50.989> of<00:03:51.019> sandstone<00:03:51.470> II<00:03:51.530> areas<00:03:52.010> so

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:52.190 
in sort of sandstone II areas so

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:54.280 
in sort of sandstone II areas so
underground<00:03:52.489> desert<00:03:53.060> biomes<00:03:53.390> I<00:03:53.600> do<00:03:53.870> believe

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:54.290 
underground desert biomes I do believe

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:55.930 
underground desert biomes I do believe
that<00:03:54.410> it<00:03:54.500> is<00:03:54.560> actually<00:03:54.739> biome<00:03:55.250> specific<00:03:55.820> which

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:55.940 
that it is actually biome specific which

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:58.720 
that it is actually biome specific which
is<00:03:56.090> very<00:03:56.420> very<00:03:56.660> cool<00:03:57.040> that's<00:03:58.040> that's<00:03:58.400> you<00:03:58.640> know

00:03:58.720 --> 00:03:58.730 
is very very cool that's that's you know

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:00.430 
is very very cool that's that's you know
really<00:03:59.000> nice<00:03:59.150> to<00:03:59.359> see<00:03:59.540> and<00:03:59.750> as<00:04:00.109> well<00:04:00.260> as<00:04:00.350> that

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:00.440 
really nice to see and as well as that

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:01.720 
really nice to see and as well as that
you<00:04:00.560> also<00:04:00.709> get<00:04:00.920> things<00:04:01.100> like<00:04:01.250> these<00:04:01.400> special

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:01.730 
you also get things like these special

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:04.000 
you also get things like these special
ice<00:04:01.910> shrooms<00:04:02.660> which<00:04:03.019> I<00:04:03.170> imagine<00:04:03.380> do<00:04:03.680> spawn

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:04.010 
ice shrooms which I imagine do spawn

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:06.280 
ice shrooms which I imagine do spawn
underneath<00:04:04.549> the<00:04:05.030> sort<00:04:05.269> of<00:04:05.329> tundra<00:04:05.630> and<00:04:06.079> the

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:06.290 
underneath the sort of tundra and the

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:07.569 
underneath the sort of tundra and the
the<00:04:06.500> snowy<00:04:06.859> biomes

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:07.579 
the snowy biomes

00:04:07.579 --> 00:04:09.910 
the snowy biomes
which<00:04:08.030> I<00:04:08.180> also<00:04:08.359> think<00:04:08.720> is<00:04:08.870> very<00:04:09.109> very<00:04:09.350> cool<00:04:09.680> all

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:09.920 
which I also think is very very cool all

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:12.699 
which I also think is very very cool all
of<00:04:10.070> which<00:04:10.190> glow<00:04:10.609> by<00:04:10.910> the<00:04:10.970> way<00:04:11.120> shall<00:04:11.450> we<00:04:11.709> cut

00:04:12.699 --> 00:04:12.709 
of which glow by the way shall we cut

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:15.160 
of which glow by the way shall we cut
the<00:04:12.829> lights<00:04:13.040> who<00:04:13.700> are<00:04:13.880> there<00:04:14.480> you<00:04:14.630> go<00:04:14.840> see<00:04:15.140> that

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:15.170 
the lights who are there you go see that

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:17.349 
the lights who are there you go see that
is<00:04:15.530> cool<00:04:16.010> as<00:04:16.250> anything<00:04:16.370> don't<00:04:16.850> you<00:04:16.910> think<00:04:17.150> I

00:04:17.349 --> 00:04:17.359 
is cool as anything don't you think I

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:19.270 
is cool as anything don't you think I
really<00:04:17.840> really<00:04:18.019> like<00:04:18.200> that<00:04:18.229> I<00:04:18.410> just<00:04:19.100> don't

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:19.280 
really really like that I just don't

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:20.770 
really really like that I just don't
know<00:04:19.370> why<00:04:19.519> I<00:04:19.549> like<00:04:19.820> this<00:04:19.850> not<00:04:20.150> so<00:04:20.359> much<00:04:20.390> but<00:04:20.750> I

00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:20.780 
know why I like this not so much but I

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:22.420 
know why I like this not so much but I
really<00:04:21.109> think<00:04:21.289> that<00:04:21.320> it<00:04:21.470> adds<00:04:21.620> just<00:04:21.769> a<00:04:21.950> visual

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:22.430 
really think that it adds just a visual

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:25.060 
really think that it adds just a visual
spark<00:04:22.940> to<00:04:23.510> being<00:04:23.750> underground<00:04:24.080> and<00:04:24.590> I<00:04:24.680> kind<00:04:25.039> of

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:25.070 
spark to being underground and I kind of

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:27.219 
spark to being underground and I kind of
like<00:04:25.250> all<00:04:25.430> the<00:04:25.550> old<00:04:25.729> offensive<00:04:26.419> jazzy<00:04:26.750> colors

00:04:27.219 --> 00:04:27.229 
like all the old offensive jazzy colors

00:04:27.229 --> 00:04:30.250 
like all the old offensive jazzy colors
and<00:04:27.380> stuff<00:04:27.940> but<00:04:28.940> yeah<00:04:29.210> it's<00:04:29.510> just<00:04:29.720> a<00:04:29.870> small<00:04:30.080> mod

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:30.260 
and stuff but yeah it's just a small mod

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:31.690 
and stuff but yeah it's just a small mod
but<00:04:30.440> I<00:04:30.470> really<00:04:30.800> thought<00:04:30.950> you<00:04:31.070> guys<00:04:31.100> would<00:04:31.460> like

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:31.700 
but I really thought you guys would like

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:33.909 
but I really thought you guys would like
it<00:04:31.910> and<00:04:32.120> you<00:04:32.900> know<00:04:33.020> I<00:04:33.050> thought<00:04:33.260> you'd<00:04:33.409> enjoy<00:04:33.500> it

00:04:33.909 --> 00:04:33.919 
it and you know I thought you'd enjoy it

00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:35.890 
it and you know I thought you'd enjoy it
so<00:04:34.190> it's<00:04:34.970> one<00:04:35.090> of<00:04:35.180> those<00:04:35.240> months<00:04:35.510> that<00:04:35.630> doesn't

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:35.900 
so it's one of those months that doesn't

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:37.719 
so it's one of those months that doesn't
change<00:04:36.080> anything<00:04:36.590> about<00:04:36.860> the<00:04:37.099> game<00:04:37.310> apart

00:04:37.719 --> 00:04:37.729 
change anything about the game apart

00:04:37.729 --> 00:04:37.990 
change anything about the game apart
from

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:38.000 
from

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.460 
from
just<00:04:38.150> the<00:04:38.240> visuals<00:04:38.570> which<00:04:38.720> is<00:04:38.870> why<00:04:39.020> I<00:04:39.050> really

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:39.470 
just the visuals which is why I really

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:41.110 
just the visuals which is why I really
like<00:04:39.680> doing<00:04:39.860> mods<00:04:40.130> like<00:04:40.310> this<00:04:40.520> and<00:04:40.790> because

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:41.120 
like doing mods like this and because
