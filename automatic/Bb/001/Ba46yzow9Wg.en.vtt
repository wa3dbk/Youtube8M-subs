00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:02.780
 nowadays tired wood scene have become 

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:04.260
 luxury 

00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:06.320
 our became and most likely made from 

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:08.550
 pressed wood for example from 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:10.740
 whether dsp from low-cost substitutes 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:12.010
 produced from products 

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:15.010
 wood processing 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:19.869
 sawmill approaches all her for 

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:21.810
 wood chip manufacturing 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:22.380
 slabs 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.750
 the process begins with sawdust which 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.310
 take the plant out in huge numbers 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:29.730
 other components are wood 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.480
 shavles leshchevsky 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:34.840
 shavings and chips are loaded into the crusher 

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:37.240
 which acts like a giant kitchen 

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:40.240
 combine times small them into small pieces 

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:45.200
 thickness of the resulting particles 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:46.960
 does not exceed the seventies 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:49.960
 millimeters 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:00.680
 to remove excess moisture particles by 25 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:04.010
 minutes placed in a giant dryer 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:06.890
 ignition towers expect dust to spring 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:09.890
 remaining in crusher 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.280
 hence the dried wood particles 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.320
 come across in the mechanical city 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.680
 which sorts them by size 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.650
 too big pieces re missing 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.070
 through the crusher 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:29.640
 larger particles form an internal 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.110
 layer interesting chipboard 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:33.790
 fine particles form more 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:36.560
 The smooth upper layer is meanwhile made of small 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.550
 bats of paraffin from seven parts of hardeners 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:42.220
 mixed glue 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:45.160
 machines to mix the clip with particles and 

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:48.160
 form a continuous long canvas 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:51.979
 cold press removes from it 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:54.420
 air from hot to intensify 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.420
 actions glue from press it 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:01.439
 then it cuts the whole thing 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.189
 swamp into large pieces which 

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:04.470
 are called slabs 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:06.630
 they are even hotter after hot press 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.110
 therefore they are left to cool for 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:11.429
 half an hour 

00:02:11.429 --> 00:02:13.609
 after the police shoot them 

00:02:13.609 --> 00:02:15.229
 grind 

00:02:15.229 --> 00:02:17.919
 then that the dealer still has mechanisms folding 

00:02:17.919 --> 00:02:20.839
 one thousand to the other 80 pieces 

00:02:20.839 --> 00:02:22.339
 descendant they are shot on 

00:02:22.339 --> 00:02:24.269
 smaller pieces and sends 

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:27.269
 to consumers 

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:31.680
 at the slab furniture factory and first 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.620
 turn cover decorative 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:36.049
 coated 

00:02:36.049 --> 00:02:38.359
 first surface of the slab and cover 

00:02:38.359 --> 00:02:39.849
 glue 

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:42.569
 then another car on the edge strip 

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:44.709
 decorative paper and a half meter wide 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:47.930
 resin-reinforced pollak and other 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:49.609
 chemicals 

00:02:49.609 --> 00:02:52.209
 this cover may have different sects 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:52.760
 picture 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:53.819
 it may be plain 

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:57.009
 imitating borders or wood 

00:02:57.009 --> 00:02:59.309
 blade cuts paper at intervals 

00:02:59.309 --> 00:03:00.220
 between the plates 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:02.470
 then the mechanism is shaping up the police 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:05.369
 state years before they are unleashed 

00:03:05.369 --> 00:03:08.039
 saw cuts from six to eight plates 

00:03:08.039 --> 00:03:08.850
 at the same time 

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:11.909
 depending on their thickness 

00:03:11.909 --> 00:03:14.909
 next stage trim edges 

00:03:16.309 --> 00:03:19.179
 glued PVC tape which then 

00:03:19.179 --> 00:03:21.569
 trim goal to give neat 

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:24.569
 kind of 

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:41.959
 then the parts are ready for assembly 

00:03:43.789 --> 00:03:46.239
 drilling installation does in 

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:48.069
 these holes for connecting 

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:49.399
 baltics 

00:03:49.399 --> 00:03:51.569
 meanwhile you yourself bolts and nuts washers 

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:52.779
 required for assembly 

00:03:52.779 --> 00:03:56.129
 laid out on packages slides different 

00:03:56.129 --> 00:03:58.439
 nuts washers are in different 

00:03:58.439 --> 00:03:59.250
 drives 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:01.110
 and the car counts them just enough 

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:03.450
 how much is needed to assemble this type 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:06.450
 of furniture 

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:08.979
 packaged 

00:04:08.979 --> 00:04:11.059
 metal parts automatically 

00:04:11.059 --> 00:04:13.199
 weigh in to make sure everything is on 

00:04:13.199 --> 00:04:14.039
 place 

00:04:14.039 --> 00:04:15.709
 from time to time workers collect 

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:18.089
 sample to check all 

00:04:18.089 --> 00:04:19.329
 fits well 

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:20.400
 if it is true 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:22.440
 can continue production and 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:25.440
 start packing 

00:04:26.909 --> 00:04:28.309
 all parts necessary for 

00:04:28.309 --> 00:04:30.139
 the assembly of this type of furniture to develop 

00:04:30.139 --> 00:04:32.019
 together including metal bag 

00:04:32.019 --> 00:04:34.349
 parts and assembly instructions then they 

00:04:34.349 --> 00:04:35.639
 are covered by polyethylene 

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:36.900
 film 

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:39.199
 let this furniture is not a masterpiece of red 

00:04:39.199 --> 00:04:41.910
 tree but its function it performs
