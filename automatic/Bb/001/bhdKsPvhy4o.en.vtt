00:00:04.509 --> 00:00:09.500
 everyone knows a lot of problems 

00:00:07.189 --> 00:00:11.179
 remote control in the house and if you 

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:13.309
 For example, just watched a movie 

00:00:11.179 --> 00:00:15.019
 via a blu-ray player 

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:16.850
 I wanted to watch TV that your name 

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:17.960
 in your TV to another 

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:19.850
 kind 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:21.289
 you're always with multiple distances in 

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:22.300
 the fiddling 

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:24.349
 fortunately there are universal 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:26.240
 remote controls and recently 

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:26.779
 logitech to a new variant 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:29.750
 added 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:31.609
 the longe draws harmony ultimate on this one 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:33.470
 remote control sit next to a number 

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:34.820
 fixed buttons for volume, for example 

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:37.040
 and for creating 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:39.950
 there is also a touchscreen on it 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:43.130
 there is a charging station in the box and 

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:44.870
 in addition and this cabin 

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:46.580
 takes care of the infrared signal 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:48.920
 all devices can then resumed 

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:51.110
 and plus you can get it on wifi 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:52.400
 and there is also a look 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:54.560
 to top 

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:57.140
 well the power ahead the harmony is that 

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:59.180
 he actually works in activities and 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:03.020
 not so much in terms of devices 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:05.090
 like the tv the blu-ray the decoder of the 

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:07.370
 game console but assume 

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:09.890
 activities that you want or that you want 

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:13.880
 watch tv or you want to watch movie or your 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:15.470
 play a game that are activities 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:18.560
 which you must first define 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:21.170
 for the device to use that 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:23.930
 to do you need the harmony on one 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:25.880
 connect computer 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:29.450
 then to www 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:30.080
 my harmony could go up you have to 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:32.480
 because 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:33.830
 Install software often and do it yourself 

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:35.360
 also register 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:37.190
 have you done all that then you can 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:40.490
 so ongoing with and defining 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:43.280
 those activities for example is fast 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:46.159
 watch TV and then you give up on the TV 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:48.229
 the decoder must be on and in addition 

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:50.690
 also indicate on which input the TV 

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:52.310
 We must also put it first 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:52.970
 indicate which devices are at home 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:54.920
 stood 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:56.600
 Fortunately Lootje draws a big one 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:59.960
 database so the chance is also big 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:01.120
 that your device and will be there 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:04.000
 I already have one 

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:05.400
 Apple devices but it added 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.700
 'm going to pull out one 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:12.460
 and that is going to add device and so 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:13.540
 then I type in the name of the 

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:16.540
 manufacturer 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:18.580
 in this case it is an apple tv 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:21.510
 which I add to it 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:24.100
 I click for our add the device 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:28.060
 are in the database and I want to 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:33.010
 indeed adding in itself says yes and 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:35.740
 now it has been added to my tv 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:38.260
 set of devices well that's a step the 

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:41.200
 next step is also the file pc and me 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:43.440
 So now go team at logic activity in it 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.440
 put 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:49.120
 well i have all activities 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:53.170
 programmed and inexpensive 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:55.390
 I want to watch TV now and then watch TV 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:57.690
 I actually succeed and although I have one 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:57.690
 game of gaming 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:04.180
 the xbox turns on and the TV switches to 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:06.070
 sharing the correct entry with works very 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:09.220
 easy because you do everything with one button 

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:11.380
 so just sitting on can do something 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:12.730
 downsides fixed one thing there 

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:14.170
 for example, there is no keyboard on it 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:16.600
 that's difficult for that 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:18.840
 enter text on televisions and that is 

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:21.820
 something that we see more and more often 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:24.700
 next to the tub with both the 80 euros 

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:26.110
 is that wants firm but I do think so 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:28.750
 you divide shortly convenience 

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:29.020
 He also buys back well 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:30.880
 hand 

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:33.940
 the buttons are easy to operate and 

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:36.520
 the touchscreen also responds very quickly 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:39.310
 actually say the ultimate in again 

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:40.470
 house discard all other like him offer 

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:43.150
 the side 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:45.519
 only one but we still put it at night 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:48.180
 in the charger so you will be fine again tomorrow 

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:48.180
 can watch TV
