it's<00:04:16.570> a<00:04:16.630> pretty<00:04:16.840> decent<00:04:17.200> light<00:04:19.380> and<00:04:20.380> I<00:04:20.440> also

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:20.620 
it's a pretty decent light and I also

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:24.180 
it's a pretty decent light and I also
brought<00:04:20.890> my<00:04:20.980> energizer<00:04:22.350> Cree<00:04:23.350> headlamp<00:04:23.860> which

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:24.190 
brought my energizer Cree headlamp which

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:26.490 
brought my energizer Cree headlamp which
is<00:04:24.550> okay<00:04:24.940> but<00:04:25.000> I<00:04:25.390> probably<00:04:25.660> won't<00:04:25.900> take<00:04:26.170> it<00:04:26.350> out

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:26.500 
is okay but I probably won't take it out

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:30.210 
is okay but I probably won't take it out
in<00:04:27.070> the<00:04:27.300> bush<00:04:28.300> too<00:04:28.570> much<00:04:28.810> it<00:04:29.050> it<00:04:29.620> runs<00:04:29.830> on<00:04:30.010> one

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:30.220 
in the bush too much it it runs on one

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:33.090 
in the bush too much it it runs on one
double-a<00:04:30.640> battery<00:04:31.060> which<00:04:31.330> is<00:04:31.360> good<00:04:31.840> but<00:04:32.110> it

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:33.100 
double-a battery which is good but it

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:34.680 
double-a battery which is good but it
doesn't<00:04:33.340> last<00:04:33.640> for<00:04:33.910> long<00:04:33.940> and<00:04:34.240> I<00:04:34.300> just<00:04:34.330> don't

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:34.690 
doesn't last for long and I just don't

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:39.560 
doesn't last for long and I just don't
like<00:04:35.820> the<00:04:36.820> shade<00:04:37.120> of<00:04:37.300> light<00:04:37.540> that<00:04:37.750> it<00:04:37.900> puts<00:04:38.170> out

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:39.570 
like the shade of light that it puts out

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:45.030 
like the shade of light that it puts out
it<00:04:40.570> does<00:04:40.810> have<00:04:42.570> it<00:04:43.570> does<00:04:43.600> adjust<00:04:44.170> as<00:04:44.740> you<00:04:44.830> can

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:45.040 
it does have it does adjust as you can

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:46.590 
it does have it does adjust as you can
see<00:04:45.190> it'll<00:04:45.340> turn<00:04:45.580> down<00:04:45.880> a<00:04:45.910> little<00:04:46.180> bit<00:04:46.390> here

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:46.600 
see it'll turn down a little bit here

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:51.210 
see it'll turn down a little bit here
there<00:04:46.960> it<00:04:47.050> goes<00:04:47.260> and<00:04:48.180> it<00:04:49.180> does<00:04:49.390> have<00:04:50.220> night

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:51.220 
there it goes and it does have night

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:54.570 
there it goes and it does have night
lights<00:04:51.490> on<00:04:51.670> it<00:04:51.820> the<00:04:51.970> red<00:04:52.150> lights<00:04:52.950> so<00:04:53.950> it<00:04:54.280> works

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:54.580 
lights on it the red lights so it works

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:59.280 
lights on it the red lights so it works
well<00:04:54.910> but<00:04:55.480> I<00:04:55.840> don't<00:04:56.380> know<00:04:56.530> I<00:04:56.850> like<00:04:57.850> my<00:04:58.290> older

00:04:59.280 --> 00:04:59.290 
well but I don't know I like my older

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:02.940 
well but I don't know I like my older
energizer<00:05:00.660> headlamp<00:05:01.660> it<00:05:02.230> just<00:05:02.470> seems<00:05:02.650> to<00:05:02.800> give

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:02.950 
energizer headlamp it just seems to give

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:05.490 
energizer headlamp it just seems to give
out<00:05:03.420> better<00:05:04.420> light<00:05:04.690> than<00:05:04.870> this<00:05:05.020> one<00:05:05.200> but<00:05:05.320> this

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:05.500 
out better light than this one but this

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:07.920 
out better light than this one but this
is<00:05:05.560> kind<00:05:05.890> of<00:05:05.980> nifty<00:05:06.130> the<00:05:07.090> battery<00:05:07.450> goes<00:05:07.630> in<00:05:07.810> the

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:07.930 
is kind of nifty the battery goes in the

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:10.800 
is kind of nifty the battery goes in the
back<00:05:08.310> just<00:05:09.310> one<00:05:09.490> double-a<00:05:10.000> so<00:05:10.390> I<00:05:10.420> guess<00:05:10.630> that's

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:10.810 
back just one double-a so I guess that's

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:13.110 
back just one double-a so I guess that's
an<00:05:11.020> advantage<00:05:11.380> so<00:05:12.220> it<00:05:12.310> does<00:05:12.490> work<00:05:12.760> but<00:05:12.970> it

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:13.120 
an advantage so it does work but it

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:15.240 
an advantage so it does work but it
wouldn't<00:05:13.330> be<00:05:13.420> my<00:05:13.600> primary<00:05:13.930> choice<00:05:14.470> for<00:05:14.800> for

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:15.250 
wouldn't be my primary choice for for

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:30.820 
wouldn't be my primary choice for for
backpacking

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:30.830 

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:32.779 

so<00:05:31.830> we're<00:05:31.979> going<00:05:32.099> to<00:05:32.190> hang<00:05:32.370> out<00:05:32.490> for<00:05:32.699> a<00:05:32.759> few

00:05:32.779 --> 00:05:32.789 
so we're going to hang out for a few

00:05:32.789 --> 00:05:36.999 
so we're going to hang out for a few
hours<00:05:33.270> maybe<00:05:33.479> do<00:05:33.780> some<00:05:34.020> hiking<00:05:35.539> and<00:05:36.539> then

00:05:36.999 --> 00:05:37.009 
hours maybe do some hiking and then

00:05:37.009 --> 00:05:39.619 
hours maybe do some hiking and then
we'll<00:05:38.009> head<00:05:38.190> on<00:05:38.220> out<00:05:38.520> we<00:05:38.759> only<00:05:38.909> could<00:05:39.150> stay<00:05:39.389> one

00:05:39.619 --> 00:05:39.629 
we'll head on out we only could stay one

00:05:39.629 --> 00:06:08.800 
we'll head on out we only could stay one
night

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:08.810 

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:11.270 

that's<00:06:09.810> a<00:06:10.080> little<00:06:10.410> glimpse<00:06:10.680> of<00:06:10.800> our<00:06:10.950> short

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:11.280 
that's a little glimpse of our short

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:18.440 
that's a little glimpse of our short
trip<00:06:12.860> cyclists<00:06:13.860> 12:22<00:06:15.440> out
