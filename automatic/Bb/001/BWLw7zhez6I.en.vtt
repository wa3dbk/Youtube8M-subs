but I just can't prioritize the money

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.970 
but I just can't prioritize the money
for<00:00:45.450> it<00:00:45.570> because<00:00:45.719> there<00:00:46.140> are<00:00:46.260> other<00:00:46.469> more

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
for it because there are other more

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.709

important<00:00:47.550> things<00:00:47.789> that<00:00:47.969> I<00:00:48.059> have<00:00:48.180> to<00:00:48.270> pay<00:00:48.450> for

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
important things that I have to pay for

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:51.380 
important things that I have to pay for
such<00:00:48.930> as<00:00:49.110> gas<00:00:49.379> and<00:00:49.829> food<00:00:50.520> and<00:00:50.879> things<00:00:50.969> like

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
such as gas and food and things like

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.479 
such as gas and food and things like
that<00:00:51.600> so<00:00:51.899> I<00:00:51.930> don't<00:00:52.170> die<00:00:52.590> and<00:00:52.949> so<00:00:53.129> I<00:00:53.190> can<00:00:53.370> get

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
that so I don't die and so I can get

00:00:53.489 --> 00:01:00.020

places<00:00:54.800> so<00:00:56.329> with<00:00:57.329> that<00:00:57.539> said<00:00:58.100> I<00:00:59.100> think<00:00:59.730> the

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
places so with that said I think the

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.479 
places so with that said I think the
expansion<00:01:00.390> comes<00:01:00.780> out<00:01:00.960> next<00:01:01.320> month<00:01:01.489> September
