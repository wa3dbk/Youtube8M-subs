00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:14.130
 3 Mr. Abe was way after the word 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.930
 bj 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:34.930
 t 4 

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:42.810
 voodoo 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:45.710
 It is contained in xi 3 of a detailed product 

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:45.710
 Hmm 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:53.840
 I'm going forward 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:55.410
 I feel people have to really smooth Purakushon control 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:01:02.300
 Out of 4 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:02.300
 It is easy to understand the sinker direction of the attraction direction 

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:30.930
 You just saw the ice traction and braking performance 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:32.290
 Well, I'm doing a lot of performance improvement, but I still strengthen ice here most 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:36.040
 Because 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:39.910
 Well this is properly compared with xi 2 help too 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:44.140
 Especially this is an obvious difference in traction 

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:44.770
 It 's an easy-to-understand attraction for subordinates and new attractions . Drive by yourself. 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:49.100
 Also 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:56.360
 Become club before before to the south smoothly 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:59.920
 Even in the time of about six seconds, it does not go to one second one second now it is going to drop to comma 8 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:03.830
 Well, I think it can be experienced by anyone riding 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:08.580
 To be honest , Michelin's studless Nemage 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:11.680
 Since the ordinary or the wet to buy a road dry wonderfully good 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:13.380
 Do you live in the metropolitan area 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.810
 It is directed to the people 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:23.459
 In fact, it is a general image 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:24.780
 Such a lot of ice is produced in the road surface in Japan , and then Shingo also has a staff behind it 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:30.270
 When there are many stop &amp; go 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:33.959
 So in that area there is an image that Japanese tires are more specialized in performance. 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:35.830
 There was, but it is the first time today 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:36.500
 Try riding a lot properly 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:41.320
 is 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:41.320
 I realized that it was a mistake 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:48.370
 It means that the level is high in terms of being able to get up 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:52.640
 After that 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:56.510
 When I get on the ice and improve the performance 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:03:00.420
 Nde grip is improved even so the better Toka its time 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:03.340
 It became a little tricky as well but I got to do bad is the real role of 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:09.160
 Bottom price Michelin goes to the end 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:13.230
 I think only the numbers there, not the whole , so I think the whole including the control 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:13.230
 It has not been getting better 

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:22.020
 voodoo j 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:30.020
 Moon photo stand 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:30.020
 eme 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:40.260
 Mithila Abe was the way forward
