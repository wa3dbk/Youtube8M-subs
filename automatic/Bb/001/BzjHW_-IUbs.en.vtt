00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
 hello we will learn how to use 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:06.290
 a microscope to observe objects 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.940
 which are not visible at the front 

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:13.160
 our microscopes are protected by 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:13.160
 plastics we remove the plastic 

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:27.560
 here is the microscope then in place 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:27.560
 the microscope cable and plug it 

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:31.199
 I will introduce you to the different 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.809
 parts of the microscope 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:36.570
 here we have the eyepiece on which we 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:39.329
 place the eye in order to observe then 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.940
 we have the goals we can 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:43.980
 choose the goal you want to use 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:51.559
 by turning them there are 3 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:54.600
 small lahlou small medium and large 

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:57.480
 this surface is called the object holder 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:02.010
 the development is done with two vices 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:06.689
 the big life is the little screw the 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:07.950
 big screw and the little screw i'm going 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:12.780
 now show you how to use 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:16.830
 the microscope we start by turning on the 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:19.610
 lamp then in place the small lens 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:21.990
 above light lamp 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:31.350
 crosses the door to budget share itself 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:33.030
 find in this hole we take the 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.700
 microscopic preparation that it's up to 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:38.040
 say the object we are going to observe in place 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.840
 the preparation on the door object the 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:42.030
 preparation must be hard from the hole of the 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.509
 carries objects in order to be traversed by 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.030
 the light 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:49.890
 it is fixed with two metal valleys 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:52.200
 so that it does not fall on 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:54.360
 then brings the door closer to 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.130
 the goal to the maximum game one does 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:02:00.630
 be careful not to break the blade 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:02.549
 looking on the bright side now 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:05.189
 in place the eye on the eyepiece for 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:07.740
 observe have brought down the door 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:11.980
 objects gently with the Vice Band 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:14.319
 until you have a clear image of the object 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:15.400
 if the object is thin between and we move 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:17.980
 gently the blade 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:22.090
 we realize the fine tuning 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:24.819
 with the little life if need we change 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:27.010
 the goal we go to the average goal 

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:29.620
 in order to see the object even bigger 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:35.739
 we redo the focus with the 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:38.470
 small screw and we can also go to 

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:43.000
 last big goal when we 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:45.069
 finished observing we put the 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.019
 prepare his place we give the little 

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:50.680
 objective to the vertical of the lamp 

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:54.129
 we turn off the lamp we unplug the 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:03:01.950
 microscope aged landreau the cable and 

00:02:54.129 --> 00:03:06.030
 finally we put the plastic back 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:06.030
 thanks and good observation
