is rated at 2001 the amplifier in the
sky<00:00:29.230> this<00:00:29.650> and<00:00:30.220> give<00:00:30.340> us<00:00:30.430> some<00:00:30.550> serious<00:00:30.760> knot

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:31.119 
sky this and give us some serious knot

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:32.970 
sky this and give us some serious knot
right<00:00:31.300> here<00:00:31.359> like<00:00:31.810> jelly<00:00:32.169> and<00:00:32.379> I<00:00:32.680> wanted<00:00:32.920> to

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:32.980 
right here like jelly and I wanted to

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:34.380 
right here like jelly and I wanted to
take<00:00:33.129> a<00:00:33.160> look<00:00:33.399> at<00:00:33.520> the<00:00:33.670> back<00:00:33.940> of<00:00:33.969> it<00:00:34.210> because

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:34.390 
take a look at the back of it because

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:37.120 
back of this that kind of bring the two

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:39.840 
back of this that kind of bring the two
together<00:00:37.300> the<00:00:37.539> 1800<00:00:38.379> sub<00:00:38.620> and<00:00:38.800> a<00:00:38.949> 1500<00:00:39.489> top<00:00:39.640> so

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:39.850 
together the 1800 sub and a 1500 top so

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:41.160 
together the 1800 sub and a 1500 top so
let's<00:00:40.030> take<00:00:40.359> a<00:00:40.420> look<00:00:40.479> at<00:00:40.600> back<00:00:40.719> edge<00:00:40.899> so<00:00:41.019> we're

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:41.170 
let's take a look at back edge so we're

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:42.809 
let's take a look at back edge so we're
looking<00:00:41.409> at<00:00:41.559> the<00:00:41.739> back<00:00:41.949> of<00:00:41.979> the<00:00:42.249> servo<00:00:42.489> on<00:00:42.550> Vega

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:42.819 
looking at the back of the servo on Vega

00:00:42.819 --> 00:00:45.540 
looking at the back of the servo on Vega
P<00:00:43.300> 1800<00:00:44.019> SX<00:00:44.440> and<00:00:44.620> there's<00:00:44.949> a<00:00:45.039> few<00:00:45.219> controls

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:45.550 
P 1800 SX and there's a few controls

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:46.590 
P 1800 SX and there's a few controls
here<00:00:45.670> I<00:00:45.699> wanted<00:00:45.850> to<00:00:45.909> kind<00:00:46.089> of<00:00:46.120> go<00:00:46.300> through<00:00:46.329> with

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:46.600 
here I wanted to kind of go through with

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:47.579 
here I wanted to kind of go through with
you<00:00:46.690> a<00:00:46.719> little<00:00:46.839> bit<00:00:47.019> because<00:00:47.170> there's<00:00:47.469> some

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:47.589 
you a little bit because there's some

00:00:47.589 --> 00:00:49.319 
you a little bit because there's some
unique<00:00:47.769> features<00:00:48.399> that<00:00:48.639> sort<00:00:48.879> with<00:00:48.969> Vega<00:00:49.179> is

00:00:49.319 --> 00:00:49.329 
unique features that sort with Vega is

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:51.599 
unique features that sort with Vega is
put<00:00:49.690> on<00:00:49.870> there<00:00:50.199> sub<00:00:50.469> which<00:00:51.039> of<00:00:51.249> course<00:00:51.309> helps

00:00:51.599 --> 00:00:51.609 
put on there sub which of course helps

00:00:51.609 --> 00:00:54.389 
put on there sub which of course helps
to<00:00:51.789> pair<00:00:52.089> up<00:00:52.210> nicely<00:00:52.479> with<00:00:52.629> that<00:00:53.039> 1500<00:00:54.039> top

00:00:54.389 --> 00:00:54.399 
to pair up nicely with that 1500 top

00:00:54.399 --> 00:00:56.369 
to pair up nicely with that 1500 top
first<00:00:55.120> off<00:00:55.329> if<00:00:55.539> you<00:00:55.659> can<00:00:55.809> take<00:00:55.959> a<00:00:55.989> look<00:00:56.139> at<00:00:56.260> this

00:00:56.369 --> 00:00:56.379 
first off if you can take a look at this

00:00:56.379 --> 00:00:58.439 
first off if you can take a look at this
we've<00:00:56.799> got<00:00:56.979> two<00:00:57.129> inputs<00:00:57.429> on<00:00:57.549> this<00:00:57.729> so<00:00:57.969> in<00:00:58.329> the

00:00:58.439 --> 00:00:58.449 
we've got two inputs on this so in the

00:00:58.449 --> 00:00:59.819 
we've got two inputs on this so in the
situations<00:00:58.959> where<00:00:59.139> you<00:00:59.260> would<00:00:59.409> want<00:00:59.530> to<00:00:59.649> run

00:00:59.819 --> 00:00:59.829 
situations where you would want to run

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:02.430 
situations where you would want to run
once<00:01:00.789> up<00:01:01.179> with<00:01:01.539> two<00:01:01.659> tops<00:01:01.929> you<00:01:02.170> can<00:01:02.289> certainly

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:02.440 
once up with two tops you can certainly

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:04.079 
once up with two tops you can certainly
do<00:01:02.649> that<00:01:02.709> you<00:01:03.190> can<00:01:03.309> come<00:01:03.459> in<00:01:03.609> with<00:01:03.789> the<00:01:03.940> two

00:01:04.079 --> 00:01:04.089 
do that you can come in with the two

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:05.789 
do that you can come in with the two
inputs<00:01:04.540> and<00:01:04.750> you<00:01:04.839> can<00:01:04.960> pop<00:01:05.110> on<00:01:05.229> two<00:01:05.409> two<00:01:05.560> tops

00:01:05.789 --> 00:01:05.799 
inputs and you can pop on two two tops

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:08.130 
inputs and you can pop on two two tops
and<00:01:06.340> you<00:01:06.580> have<00:01:06.760> your<00:01:06.909> base<00:01:07.090> of<00:01:07.390> course<00:01:07.540> all

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:08.140 
and you have your base of course all

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:10.230 
and you have your base of course all
coming<00:01:08.440> through<00:01:08.590> the<00:01:08.650> once<00:01:08.830> up<00:01:09.040> and<00:01:09.400> then<00:01:10.150> we

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:10.240 
coming through the once up and then we

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:11.820 
coming through the once up and then we
have<00:01:10.330> the<00:01:10.450> if<00:01:10.990> you<00:01:11.170> need<00:01:11.320> to<00:01:11.380> jump<00:01:11.590> to<00:01:11.740> another

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:13.720 
we have a through that'll take the

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:14.850 
we have a through that'll take the
signal<00:01:14.080> and<00:01:14.200> of<00:01:14.260> course<00:01:14.440> send<00:01:14.620> that<00:01:14.740> through

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:14.860 
signal and of course send that through

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:17.310 
signal and of course send that through
once<00:01:15.730> again<00:01:15.880> if<00:01:16.240> you<00:01:16.450> check<00:01:16.690> our<00:01:16.810> video<00:01:17.050> which

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:24.340 
that works out and of course the same

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:25.620 
that works out and of course the same
thing<00:01:24.370> goes<00:01:24.670> with<00:01:24.790> the<00:01:24.850> substance<00:01:25.330> goes<00:01:25.480> with

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:25.630 
thing goes with the substance goes with

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:26.850 
thing goes with the substance goes with
the<00:01:25.750> top<00:01:25.900> that's<00:01:26.110> kind<00:01:26.320> of<00:01:26.350> a<00:01:26.410> cool<00:01:26.590> feature

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:26.860

the top that's kind of a cool feature
that's<00:01:27.130> our<00:01:27.250> one<00:01:27.340> Vega<00:01:27.520> as<00:01:27.990> we<00:01:28.990> change

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:29.170 
that's our one Vega as we change

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:31.290 
that's our one Vega as we change
polarity<00:01:29.380> one<00:01:30.370> area<00:01:30.670> that's<00:01:30.880> kind<00:01:31.120> of<00:01:31.150> unique

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:31.300 
polarity one area that's kind of unique

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:34.110 
polarity one area that's kind of unique
to<00:01:31.480> the<00:01:31.840> sermon<00:01:32.290> Vega<00:01:32.500> sub<00:01:33.040> is<00:01:33.250> or<00:01:33.580> at<00:01:33.760> zero<00:01:34.000> and

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:36.070 
Vega speakers is the ability to add the

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:38.340 
Vega speakers is the ability to add the
mega<00:01:36.730> base<00:01:36.970> but<00:01:37.420> the<00:01:37.480> guys<00:01:37.660> who<00:01:37.840> grew<00:01:38.020> up<00:01:38.050> with

the<00:01:56.920> top<00:01:57.100> together<00:01:57.460> and<00:01:57.730> then<00:01:57.880> it's<00:01:58.450> an

00:01:58.680 --> 00:01:58.690 
the top together and then it's an

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:00.030 
the top together and then it's an
incredible<00:01:59.080> sounding<00:01:59.350> system<00:01:59.620> I<00:01:59.710> think<00:01:59.740> if

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:00.040 
incredible sounding system I think if

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:01.470 
incredible sounding system I think if
you're<00:02:00.160> looking<00:02:00.460> for<00:02:00.670> a<00:02:00.700> high<00:02:00.850> power<00:02:01.090> system

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:01.480 
you're looking for a high power system

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:04.230 
you're looking for a high power system
it's<00:02:01.930> got<00:02:02.140> a<00:02:02.170> clean<00:02:02.590> sub<00:02:03.160> sound<00:02:03.640> and<00:02:03.910> a<00:02:03.970> clean

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:04.240 
it's got a clean sub sound and a clean

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:04.770 
it's got a clean sub sound and a clean
high

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:04.780 
high

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:07.320

I<00:02:04.810> think<00:02:05.320> the<00:02:05.440> Cerwyn<00:02:05.770> Vega<00:02:05.980> P<00:02:06.550> series<00:02:06.820> is<00:02:07.090> one

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:07.330 
I think the Cerwyn Vega P series is one

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:08.669 
I think the Cerwyn Vega P series is one
