00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:10.290
 there are two definitions at the end 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.600
 transition stage 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.850
 there is that given by the journalists 

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:16.890
 that is when a step does not bring 

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:17.730
 no change in the ranking 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.350
 general 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.270
 and this usually happens on a 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.140
 plain stage this was the case 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.480
 by the way today 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:27.779
 and then there is the definition that gives 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.130
 the runners at the end transition well 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.779
 there was no transition on this 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.490
 Tour de France by their own admission 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:35.610
 to say that at no time were they able to 

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:36.960
 recover and do not notify you to 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.239
 contradict listen rather 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.460
 what their managers say Marc 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.649
 madiot there was a lot to do for 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.879
 everyone for all believes that 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:48.480
 its location for those who have a 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:50.060
 jersey it's driving days 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.650
 transition 

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:53.720
 those who have never cycled 

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:55.400
 come do this kind of step once 

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:57.140
 in their life they will pronounce more 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:58.280
 never the word of transition but we 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:59.990
 knew it was dangerous 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:01.340
 everyone knows the area there 

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:04.580
 comes from time to time on the med tour 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:06.110
 especially and then we know by the way 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:07.370
 from the tour de france or paris nice or 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:09.250
 other races we know it's 

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:10.830
 places where there is wind 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:13.660
 for a long time there was wind 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:16.600
 after there were thunderstorms the wind is 

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:17.710
 unique face more this morning the weather 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:19.090
 were all divergent 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:20.410
 we went to different sites 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:22.570
 never went the same weather that 

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:25.630
 is displayed is so sacred the tension 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:27.190
 I did all day 10 15 km 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:30.030
 in front of the peloton I had to send 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:31.560
 do not know 150 text 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.690
 and 25 phone calls to thierry bricaud and 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.740
 to my brother to tell them what's 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:37.200
 passed in front of the conditions 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:39.270
 it's more of a bike 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.799
 sailing it's like said guy market the 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.360
 sailing the bike yeah but it's really 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:49.979
 sailing is great 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:51.420
 in ten years yeah but all we knew at 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:53.460
 a turn and after the transition state 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.470
 so in the head 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:57.390
 did not have to unplug yet there is 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:59.280
 so not really had a break at 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.740
 during this day for runners 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.610
 in any case there was at the end of this 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.890
 15th step 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:07.500
 some relief yes today 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:11.280
 a mark they go thierry had decided 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:12.660
 to ensure for the general that 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.220
 thibault do not waste time 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:17.340
 especially as they advertise and rain and 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:20.340
 the wind so it's hard to get 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:22.650
 focus on two goals know the 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:24.530
 sprinter thibault knowing thibault in 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:27.090
 the last kilometer needs someone with 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:29.459
 in case there is a break or something 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:32.069
 thing so here we have all worked 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:33.150
 even arnaud like his aunt and 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:35.280
 curbs and that rolled in the wind 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:37.019
 for thibaut so today arnaud 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:39.120
 was not great I thought the gastro 

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:41.280
 hyères so we decided everything 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.980
 to do on me and it's true that it 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:44.940
 michael williams it's all guys 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:46.220
 you have to be behind them, you know 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:47.780
 than 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:50.360
 the job will be done it would be well done 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:50.870
 yeah it was not easy to stay 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:51.890
 grouped 1 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:56.000
 because everyone wanted to be 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:57.370
 before after well here we were three 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.350
 parties and always some 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:02.480
 some with thibault but good if 

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:03.830
 really there was fire we would have 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:06.110
 said we get together the eight and have 

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:07.250
 rolled 8 I was well helped that's for sure 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:08.660
 that we cross and has a lot of 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:10.580
 movements like that we get lost often 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:12.410
 but we meet regularly when 

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:14.090
 even so the final vote I was fine 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:14.420
 helped so for me it was a good 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:16.460
 day 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:17.900
 there is more stress is there at night 

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:19.970
 previous one step like that a 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:21.380
 mountain table so there in more 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:24.770
 no more 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:25.970
 roundabouts everywhere so this is a 

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:28.400
 stage teaser 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:31.700
 we are in a hurry to finish so that's 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:33.800
 well everything went well so tomorrow 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:36.260
 there will be no step it will be the 

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:38.330
 second day of rest in carcassonne 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:41.270
 before the three difficult days 

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:43.700
 expected in the Pyrenees the currents 

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:45.860
 so go tonight leave nîmes for 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:48.670
 carcassonne and there we can actually 

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:48.670
 talk about transition
