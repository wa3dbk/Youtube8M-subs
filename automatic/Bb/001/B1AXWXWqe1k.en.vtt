and clean the the intake manifold I took
this<00:00:16.410> off<00:00:16.710> and<00:00:17.190> the<00:00:17.760> problem<00:00:18.270> I<00:00:18.330> found<00:00:18.600> here<00:00:18.900> is

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
this off and the problem I found here is

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:24.170 
this off and the problem I found here is
this<00:00:20.480> cover<00:00:21.480> the<00:00:22.020> plastic<00:00:22.529> cover<00:00:22.800> here<00:00:23.180> it

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180
