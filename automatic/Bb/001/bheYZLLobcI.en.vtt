areas where I haven't put rocks down put
a<00:00:30.269> little<00:00:30.929> layer<00:00:31.140> of<00:00:31.170> caulking<00:00:31.940> to<00:00:32.940> make<00:00:33.120> sure

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
a little layer of caulking to make sure

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.500 
a little layer of caulking to make sure
there's<00:00:33.480> a<00:00:33.510> sealed<00:00:33.809> off<00:00:34.050> one<00:00:34.820> you're<00:00:35.820> pointed

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
there's a sealed off one you're pointed

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.360 
there's a sealed off one you're pointed
out<00:00:36.660> that<00:00:36.930> might<00:00:37.110> be<00:00:37.260> a<00:00:37.290> good<00:00:37.500> idea<00:00:37.530> and<00:00:38.070> I<00:00:38.129> kind

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
out that might be a good idea and I kind

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.580 
out that might be a good idea and I kind
of<00:00:38.430> figured<00:00:38.760> I<00:00:38.910> had<00:00:39.120> enough<00:00:39.780> glue<00:00:40.050> on<00:00:40.320> here

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
of figured I had enough glue on here

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.770 
of figured I had enough glue on here
that<00:00:40.620> would<00:00:40.890> keep<00:00:41.040> any<00:00:41.309> of<00:00:41.489> the<00:00:41.640> water<00:00:42.300> that<00:00:42.719> I

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
that would keep any of the water that I

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.799 
that would keep any of the water that I
use<00:00:43.050> from<00:00:43.320> seeping<00:00:44.309> underneath<00:00:44.760> but<00:00:45.120> I'm<00:00:45.719> just

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:49.010 
use from seeping underneath but I'm just
gonna<00:00:45.930> go<00:00:46.050> ahead<00:00:46.350> and<00:00:46.530> do<00:00:46.649> that<00:00:46.890> just<00:00:47.899> as<00:00:48.899> an

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.770 
gonna go ahead and do that just as an
extra<00:00:49.200> precaution<00:00:49.289> and<00:00:50.120> the<00:00:51.120> place<00:00:51.360> is<00:00:51.570> where

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
extra precaution and the place is where

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.900
