00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:51.579 
important to use so when you bake you

00:02:51.579 --> 00:02:53.009 
important to use so when you bake you
put<00:02:51.760> your<00:02:51.879> stuff<00:02:52.030> in<00:02:52.209> and<00:02:52.480> the<00:02:52.599> heat<00:02:52.750> comes<00:02:52.930> on

00:02:55.559 --> 00:02:55.569 
right but when you broil only the top

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:59.490 
right but when you broil only the top
burner<00:02:55.930> turns<00:02:56.319> on<00:02:56.590> so<00:02:57.459> um<00:02:58.049> think<00:02:59.049> about<00:02:59.290> it<00:02:59.379> as

00:02:59.490 --> 00:02:59.500 
burner turns on so um think about it as

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:02.970 
burner turns on so um think about it as
