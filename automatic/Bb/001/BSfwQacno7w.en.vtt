00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:59.510 
ribbon on her hair I like how they added
that<00:01:58.409> instead<00:01:58.710> of<00:01:58.770> having<00:01:58.950> you<00:01:59.069> know<00:01:59.100> just<00:01:59.399> her

that instead of having you know just her
hair<00:01:59.729> parted<00:01:59.939> so<00:02:00.409> the<00:02:01.409> bed<00:02:01.590> looks<00:02:01.770> kind<00:02:01.950> of

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
hair parted so the bed looks kind of

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:03.679 
hair parted so the bed looks kind of
awkward<00:02:02.100> for<00:02:02.369> some<00:02:02.759> reason<00:02:03.090> I<00:02:03.270> don't<00:02:03.630> know

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
awkward for some reason I don't know

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:05.809 
awkward for some reason I don't know
it's<00:02:04.049> just<00:02:04.200> me<00:02:04.350> maybe<00:02:04.499> the<00:02:05.069> hair<00:02:05.280> kind<00:02:05.729> of<00:02:05.759> like
