00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
good and I think there was just a

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.399 
good and I think there was just a
collective<00:01:13.080> pride<00:01:13.439> that<00:01:14.479> you<00:01:15.479> know<00:01:15.600> least<00:01:15.930> 51

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
collective pride that you know least 51

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.140 
collective pride that you know least 51
percent<00:01:16.439> of<00:01:16.890> the<00:01:16.950> country<00:01:17.400> felt<00:01:17.640> or<00:01:17.880> they<00:01:17.970> went

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
percent of the country felt or they went

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.929 
percent of the country felt or they went
like<00:01:18.299> we<00:01:19.290> floated<00:01:19.830> in<00:01:20.009> like<00:01:20.340> we're

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
like we floated in like we're

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:22.700 
like we floated in like we're
progressive<00:01:21.570> we're<00:01:21.810> open-minded<00:01:22.140> that's

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
progressive we're open-minded that's

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.890 
progressive we're open-minded that's
that's<00:01:22.979> what<00:01:23.130> we<00:01:23.250> did<00:01:23.430> and<00:01:23.880> I<00:01:24.479> think<00:01:24.750> we're<00:01:24.869> on

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
that's what we did and I think we're on

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.910 
that's what we did and I think we're on
a<00:01:24.990> little<00:01:25.259> bit<00:01:25.409> of<00:01:25.439> a<00:01:25.590> roll<00:01:25.860> with<00:01:26.549> that<00:01:26.850> so<00:01:27.600> now

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:27.920 
a little bit of a roll with that so now

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.920 
a little bit of a roll with that so now
we<00:01:28.920> could<00:01:29.070> make<00:01:29.250> history<00:01:29.729> again

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
we could make history again

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.940 
we could make history again
I<00:01:30.960> mean<00:01:31.439> back<00:01:31.710> to<00:01:32.009> back<00:01:32.220> and<00:01:32.840> we're<00:01:33.840> we're<00:01:34.740> in<00:01:34.829> a

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
I mean back to back and we're we're in a

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:40.780 
I mean back to back and we're we're in a
time<00:01:35.270> when<00:01:36.270> it's<00:01:37.020> like<00:01:37.520> you<00:01:38.520> think<00:01:38.790> about<00:01:39.350> this

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:40.790 
time when it's like you think about this

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:43.359 
time when it's like you think about this
name<00:01:41.790> escapes<00:01:42.030> me<00:01:42.329> but<00:01:42.600> the<00:01:42.720> guy<00:01:42.869> just<00:01:43.170> got

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
though maybe the lion's share the

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:20.750 
though maybe the lion's share the
country<00:02:19.620> doesn't<00:02:19.890> look<00:02:19.980> at<00:02:20.100> Hillary<00:02:20.370> Clinton

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
country doesn't look at Hillary Clinton

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.170 
country doesn't look at Hillary Clinton
as<00:02:20.850> a<00:02:20.880> female<00:02:22.370> technically<00:02:23.370> she's<00:02:23.850> got<00:02:24.030> the

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
as a female technically she's got the

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:28.010 
as a female technically she's got the
parts<00:02:25.700> pretty<00:02:26.700> sure<00:02:26.970> she's<00:02:27.240> got<00:02:27.420> most<00:02:27.750> two

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:28.020 
parts pretty sure she's got most two

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:31.100 
parts pretty sure she's got most two
parts<00:02:28.470> to<00:02:28.710> make<00:02:28.890> her<00:02:29.040> female<00:02:29.520> and<00:02:29.730> I<00:02:30.270> think<00:02:30.870> we

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
parts to make her female and I think we

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:34.040 
parts to make her female and I think we

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050 
might just be on a roll going we are

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:37.270

going<00:02:34.380> to<00:02:34.560> be<00:02:34.710> part<00:02:35.100> when<00:02:35.910> history<00:02:36.420> is<00:02:36.540> written

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:37.280 
going to be part when history is written

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:40.400 
going to be part when history is written
we<00:02:38.280> will<00:02:38.460> be<00:02:38.610> that<00:02:38.820> generation<00:02:39.600> that<00:02:40.230> was

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 
ourselves if it's close that I think

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:00.950 
ourselves if it's close that I think
that<00:02:59.790> could<00:02:59.970> do<00:03:00.120> it<00:03:00.150> it's<00:03:00.480> funny<00:03:00.720> because

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:00.960 
that could do it it's funny because

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:03.050 
that could do it it's funny because
people<00:03:01.110> are<00:03:01.560> like<00:03:01.740> well<00:03:02.400> do<00:03:02.670> you<00:03:02.730> think<00:03:02.940> the

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
people are like well do you think the

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.060 
people are like well do you think the
country<00:03:03.450> is<00:03:03.480> ready<00:03:03.750> for<00:03:04.050> a<00:03:04.110> female<00:03:04.440> or<00:03:04.890> do

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:05.070 
country is ready for a female or do

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:06.650 
country is ready for a female or do
there's<00:03:05.400> a<00:03:05.490> still<00:03:05.790> you<00:03:06.090> know<00:03:06.210> that<00:03:06.390> glass

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:06.660 
there's a still you know that glass

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:09.260 
there's a still you know that glass
ceiling<00:03:06.960> or<00:03:07.530> I<00:03:07.710> think<00:03:08.700> it's<00:03:08.850> just<00:03:09.180> the

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:09.270 
ceiling or I think it's just the

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:11.810 
ceiling or I think it's just the
opposite<00:03:09.840> I<00:03:09.990> think<00:03:10.020> it's<00:03:10.350> we<00:03:10.590> like<00:03:10.950> the<00:03:11.250> way<00:03:11.400> a

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:11.820 
opposite I think it's we like the way a

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:14.270 
opposite I think it's we like the way a
lot<00:03:12.540> of<00:03:12.720> the<00:03:12.780> country<00:03:13.170> at<00:03:13.290> least<00:03:13.530> is<00:03:13.950> gonna

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
lot of the country at least is gonna

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:16.030 
lot of the country at least is gonna
like<00:03:14.550> the<00:03:14.730> way<00:03:14.760> they<00:03:15.150> feel<00:03:15.360> about<00:03:15.540> themselves

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:16.040 
like the way they feel about themselves

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:18.860 
like the way they feel about themselves
doing<00:03:17.040> that<00:03:17.220> so<00:03:17.490> I<00:03:17.910> think<00:03:18.360> she's<00:03:18.630> pretty

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
doing that so I think she's pretty

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:21.500 
doing that so I think she's pretty
viable<00:03:19.140> stop<00:03:19.950> it<00:03:20.130> you<00:03:20.280> go<00:03:20.520> it's<00:03:20.790> not<00:03:20.910> what<00:03:21.180> and

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:21.510 
viable stop it you go it's not what and
