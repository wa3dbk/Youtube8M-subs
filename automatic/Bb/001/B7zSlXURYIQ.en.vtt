in<00:00:00.740> this<00:00:01.740> lesson<00:00:01.949> we'll<00:00:02.129> explore<00:00:02.460> some<00:00:02.669> of<00:00:02.700> the

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:02.790 
in this lesson we'll explore some of the

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:04.519 
in this lesson we'll explore some of the
indirect<00:00:03.300> illumination<00:00:03.480> properties<00:00:04.319> found

00:00:04.519 --> 00:00:04.529 
indirect illumination properties found

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:08.089 
indirect illumination properties found
on<00:00:04.710> most<00:00:04.950> Softimage<00:00:05.490> materials<00:00:06.890> so<00:00:07.890> within

00:00:08.089 --> 00:00:08.099 
on most Softimage materials so within

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:10.220 
on most Softimage materials so within
Softimage<00:00:08.550> pretty<00:00:09.510> much<00:00:09.660> all<00:00:09.929> of<00:00:10.139> the

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:10.230 
Softimage pretty much all of the

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:11.870 
Softimage pretty much all of the
materials<00:00:10.710> that<00:00:10.920> are<00:00:11.160> listed<00:00:11.490> underneath

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
materials that are listed underneath

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.600 
materials that are listed underneath
this<00:00:12.150> top<00:00:12.509> grouping<00:00:13.049> of<00:00:13.170> materials<00:00:13.650> all<00:00:14.040> share

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
this top grouping of materials all share

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.240 
this top grouping of materials all share
the<00:00:14.639> same<00:00:15.120> common<00:00:15.690> parameters<00:00:16.379> as<00:00:16.800> far<00:00:17.039> as

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
the same common parameters as far as

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:18.740 
the same common parameters as far as
controlling<00:00:17.940> their<00:00:18.060> indirect<00:00:18.570> illumination

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
controlling their indirect illumination

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.560 
controlling their indirect illumination
behavior<00:00:19.529> so<00:00:20.400> let's<00:00:20.699> take<00:00:20.820> a<00:00:20.910> look<00:00:21.060> at<00:00:21.119> this<00:00:21.270> on

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
behavior so let's take a look at this on

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.259 
behavior so let's take a look at this on
just<00:00:22.050> this<00:00:22.140> simple<00:00:22.410> Taurus<00:00:23.220> object<00:00:23.670> I'll<00:00:24.180> go

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
just this simple Taurus object I'll go

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:26.689 
just this simple Taurus object I'll go
ahead<00:00:24.330> and<00:00:24.449> select<00:00:24.630> this<00:00:24.900> and<00:00:25.160> alt<00:00:26.160> right

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
ahead and select this and alt right

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:30.710 
ahead and select this and alt right
click<00:00:26.910> and<00:00:27.180> go<00:00:27.210> to<00:00:27.720> inspect<00:00:28.349> material<00:00:29.539> so<00:00:30.539> with

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
click and go to inspect material so with

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.269 
click and go to inspect material so with
this<00:00:30.750> property<00:00:31.199> page<00:00:31.380> pulled<00:00:31.650> up<00:00:31.769> we<00:00:31.980> can<00:00:32.099> jump

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
this property page pulled up we can jump

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.280 
this property page pulled up we can jump
over<00:00:32.430> into<00:00:32.820> the<00:00:32.850> indirect<00:00:33.510> illumination<00:00:33.690> tab

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
over into the indirect illumination tab

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.100 
over into the indirect illumination tab
and<00:00:34.880> just<00:00:35.880> see<00:00:36.090> what<00:00:36.210> this<00:00:36.300> looks<00:00:36.360> like<00:00:36.570> let's

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
and just see what this looks like let's

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:38.650 
and just see what this looks like let's
go<00:00:37.260> ahead<00:00:37.320> and<00:00:37.410> draw<00:00:37.649> at<00:00:37.800> a<00:00:37.829> render<00:00:38.160> region<00:00:38.430> and

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:38.660 
go ahead and draw at a render region and

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:41.840 
go ahead and draw at a render region and
just<00:00:39.660> render<00:00:39.899> this<00:00:39.989> out<00:00:40.219> so<00:00:41.219> within<00:00:41.579> this

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
just render this out so within this

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.060 
just render this out so within this
indirect<00:00:42.510> illumination<00:00:42.690> area<00:00:43.260> we<00:00:43.469> have<00:00:43.710> first

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
indirect illumination area we have first

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:45.799 
indirect illumination area we have first
off<00:00:44.250> the<00:00:44.460> control<00:00:44.850> for<00:00:45.149> global<00:00:45.660> illumination

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
off the control for global illumination

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.889 
off the control for global illumination
and<00:00:46.379> final<00:00:47.010> gathering<00:00:47.309> now<00:00:48.270> this<00:00:48.719> really

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
and final gathering now this really

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:50.840 
and final gathering now this really
won't<00:00:49.200> show<00:00:49.860> any<00:00:50.129> kind<00:00:50.340> of<00:00:50.399> an<00:00:50.460> effect<00:00:50.700> until

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
won't show any kind of an effect until

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.729 
won't show any kind of an effect until
we<00:00:51.000> have<00:00:51.270> some<00:00:51.570> sort<00:00:51.840> of<00:00:51.960> a<00:00:52.320> global

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
we have some sort of a global

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.490 
we have some sort of a global
illumination<00:00:53.010> method<00:00:53.670> turned<00:00:53.910> on<00:00:54.120> so<00:00:55.050> just<00:00:55.289> to

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
illumination method turned on so just to

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.790 
illumination method turned on so just to
demonstrate<00:00:55.680> this<00:00:56.100> go<00:00:56.879> into<00:00:57.390> render<00:00:57.930> regions

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
demonstrate this go into render regions

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.450 
demonstrate this go into render regions
and<00:00:59.070> go<00:00:59.430> into<00:00:59.579> all<00:00:59.789> options<00:01:01.039> now<00:01:02.039> go<00:01:02.190> ahead<00:01:02.309> and

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
and go into all options now go ahead and

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.600 
and go into all options now go ahead and
jump<00:01:03.059> over<00:01:03.180> into<00:01:03.420> the<00:01:03.510> final<00:01:03.780> gather<00:01:03.930> tab<00:01:04.229> and

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:04.610 
jump over into the final gather tab and

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:09.109 
jump over into the final gather tab and
enable<00:01:05.610> final<00:01:05.970> gathering<00:01:06.799> okay<00:01:07.799> so<00:01:07.909> now<00:01:08.909> with

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
enable final gathering okay so now with

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.330 
enable final gathering okay so now with
that<00:01:09.150> enabled<00:01:09.780> I'll<00:01:10.290> go<00:01:10.530> back<00:01:10.680> to<00:01:10.740> my<00:01:10.890> property

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
that enabled I'll go back to my property

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:12.440 
that enabled I'll go back to my property
page<00:01:11.490> and<00:01:11.670> now<00:01:11.760> we<00:01:11.820> should<00:01:12.030> be<00:01:12.119> able<00:01:12.180> to<00:01:12.299> see

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
page and now we should be able to see

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.660 
page and now we should be able to see
some<00:01:12.750> kind<00:01:13.020> of<00:01:13.080> effect<00:01:13.380> here<00:01:13.619> so<00:01:14.520> with<00:01:14.640> this

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
some kind of effect here so with this

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.940 
some kind of effect here so with this
will<00:01:14.909> allow<00:01:15.509> us<00:01:15.540> to<00:01:15.750> do<00:01:15.869> is<00:01:16.110> essentially<00:01:16.650> come

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
will allow us to do is essentially come

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.830 
will allow us to do is essentially come
in<00:01:17.130> and<00:01:17.369> find<00:01:17.850> the<00:01:18.000> objects<00:01:18.330> that<00:01:18.390> are<00:01:18.540> using<00:01:18.780> a

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
in and find the objects that are using a

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.990 
in and find the objects that are using a
certain<00:01:19.110> material<00:01:19.500> and<00:01:19.650> if<00:01:20.369> we<00:01:20.400> decide<00:01:20.790> maybe

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
certain material and if we decide maybe

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.570 
certain material and if we decide maybe
for<00:01:21.299> whatever<00:01:21.509> reason<00:01:21.840> we<00:01:21.960> want<00:01:22.229> the<00:01:23.130> indirect

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
for whatever reason we want the indirect

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:24.710 
for whatever reason we want the indirect
illumination<00:01:23.759> to<00:01:24.090> look<00:01:24.330> a<00:01:24.420> little<00:01:24.570> bit

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
illumination to look a little bit

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.810 
illumination to look a little bit
different<00:01:25.140> we<00:01:25.770> can<00:01:25.920> just<00:01:26.070> simply<00:01:26.310> come<00:01:26.460> in<00:01:26.610> and

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
different we can just simply come in and

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.660 
different we can just simply come in and
adjust<00:01:27.689> that<00:01:27.869> radiance<00:01:28.430> so<00:01:29.430> for<00:01:29.610> example

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
adjust that radiance so for example

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.310 
adjust that radiance so for example
right<00:01:30.060> now<00:01:30.270> with<00:01:30.540> is<00:01:30.659> set<00:01:30.840> to<00:01:30.960> 1<00:01:31.110> it's

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
right now with is set to 1 it's

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.020 
right now with is set to 1 it's
essentially<00:01:31.770> receiving<00:01:32.250> all<00:01:32.460> the<00:01:32.490> effect<00:01:32.939> of

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
essentially receiving all the effect of

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.660 
essentially receiving all the effect of
my<00:01:33.299> final<00:01:33.930> gathering<00:01:34.200> but<00:01:35.159> if<00:01:35.280> I<00:01:35.369> were<00:01:35.460> to<00:01:35.549> come

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
my final gathering but if I were to come

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.760 
my final gathering but if I were to come
in<00:01:35.790> here<00:01:35.909> and<00:01:35.970> drop<00:01:36.299> this<00:01:36.479> radiance<00:01:36.900> all<00:01:37.350> the

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
in here and drop this radiance all the

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.069 
in here and drop this radiance all the
way<00:01:37.829> down<00:01:38.009> to<00:01:38.040> zero<00:01:38.430> or<00:01:38.670> down<00:01:39.030> to<00:01:39.060> black<00:01:39.360> you

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
way down to zero or down to black you

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:41.660 
way down to zero or down to black you
can<00:01:40.229> see<00:01:40.380> that<00:01:40.409> now<00:01:40.740> everything<00:01:41.220> in<00:01:41.340> my<00:01:41.430> scene

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
can see that now everything in my scene

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.270 
can see that now everything in my scene
is<00:01:41.790> receiving<00:01:42.329> this<00:01:42.360> indirect<00:01:43.049> illumination

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:43.280 
is receiving this indirect illumination

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:45.560 
is receiving this indirect illumination
except<00:01:44.280> for<00:01:44.310> this<00:01:44.520> piece<00:01:44.729> of<00:01:44.909> geometry<00:01:45.119> or

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
except for this piece of geometry or

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.240 
except for this piece of geometry or
really<00:01:46.290> anything<00:01:46.560> that's<00:01:46.799> happened<00:01:47.100> to<00:01:47.189> be

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
really anything that's happened to be

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.090 
really anything that's happened to be
using<00:01:47.430> this<00:01:47.640> type<00:01:47.850> of<00:01:47.880> material<00:01:48.829> also<00:01:49.829> I<00:01:49.860> could

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
using this type of material also I could

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.490 
using this type of material also I could
start<00:01:50.280> to<00:01:50.369> come<00:01:50.490> in<00:01:50.610> here<00:01:50.790> and<00:01:51.380> let's<00:01:52.380> say

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
start to come in here and let's say

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:53.840 
start to come in here and let's say
maybe<00:01:52.710> one<00:01:52.950> of<00:01:52.979> the<00:01:53.130> indirect<00:01:53.700> illumination

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
maybe one of the indirect illumination

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.149 
maybe one of the indirect illumination
tinted<00:01:54.659> just<00:01:55.140> a<00:01:55.229> little<00:01:55.380> bit<00:01:55.500> differently<00:01:55.950> on

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
tinted just a little bit differently on

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:57.830 
tinted just a little bit differently on
that<00:01:56.280> object<00:01:56.460> I<00:01:56.850> can<00:01:57.450> come<00:01:57.570> back<00:01:57.659> to<00:01:57.810> my

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
that object I can come back to my

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.429 
that object I can come back to my
radiance<00:01:58.290> and<00:01:58.469> do<00:01:59.040> the<00:01:59.159> same<00:01:59.840> so<00:02:00.840> really<00:02:01.200> this

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
radiance and do the same so really this

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.380 
radiance and do the same so really this
does<00:02:01.649> become<00:02:01.950> very<00:02:02.280> very<00:02:02.460> useful<00:02:02.909> if<00:02:03.180> you<00:02:03.360> have

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
does become very very useful if you have

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.139 
does become very very useful if you have
certain<00:02:03.990> situations<00:02:04.619> where<00:02:04.829> maybe

00:02:05.139 --> 00:02:05.149 
certain situations where maybe

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:07.280 
certain situations where maybe
everything<00:02:06.149> in<00:02:06.240> your<00:02:06.360> scene<00:02:06.540> looks<00:02:06.780> good<00:02:07.020> but

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
everything in your scene looks good but

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.469 
everything in your scene looks good but
except<00:02:07.770> maybe<00:02:07.860> one<00:02:08.310> object<00:02:08.670> could<00:02:09.270> maybe

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
except maybe one object could maybe

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.390 
except maybe one object could maybe
stand<00:02:09.810> to<00:02:09.869> be<00:02:09.959> a<00:02:09.989> little<00:02:10.050> bit<00:02:10.289> brighter<00:02:10.440> or<00:02:11.340> a

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
stand to be a little bit brighter or a

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.369 
stand to be a little bit brighter or a
little<00:02:11.760> bit<00:02:11.849> darker<00:02:12.209> you<00:02:12.810> can<00:02:12.959> just<00:02:13.110> come<00:02:13.200> in

00:02:13.369 --> 00:02:13.379 
little bit darker you can just come in

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:13.970 
little bit darker you can just come in
find<00:02:13.650> your<00:02:13.770> way

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
find your way

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.759 
find your way
cereal<00:02:14.190> adjust<00:02:15.120> that<00:02:15.209> radiance<00:02:15.629> and<00:02:15.840> you're

00:02:16.759 --> 00:02:16.769 
cereal adjust that radiance and you're

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:20.930 
cereal adjust that radiance and you're
good<00:02:16.950> to<00:02:16.980> go<00:02:18.319> so<00:02:19.319> as<00:02:19.620> far<00:02:19.920> as<00:02:19.980> the<00:02:20.250> incandescent

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
good to go so as far as the incandescent

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:23.149 
good to go so as far as the incandescent
we<00:02:21.840> also<00:02:22.049> have<00:02:22.349> the<00:02:22.470> ability<00:02:22.560> to<00:02:22.830> actually

00:02:23.149 --> 00:02:23.159 
we also have the ability to actually

00:02:23.159 --> 00:02:25.070 
we also have the ability to actually
essentially<00:02:24.120> make<00:02:24.239> this<00:02:24.360> object<00:02:24.720> to<00:02:24.780> look<00:02:24.930> as

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
essentially make this object to look as

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.770 
essentially make this object to look as
if<00:02:25.260> it<00:02:25.409> were<00:02:25.709> glowing<00:02:26.250> so<00:02:27.060> if<00:02:27.299> I<00:02:27.420> were<00:02:27.510> to<00:02:27.540> set

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
if it were glowing so if I were to set

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:31.250 
if it were glowing so if I were to set
the<00:02:29.060> value<00:02:30.060> for<00:02:30.209> that<00:02:30.269> back<00:02:30.480> to<00:02:30.720> one<00:02:30.989> just

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
the value for that back to one just

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:32.869 
the value for that back to one just
temporarily<00:02:31.650> now<00:02:32.280> let's<00:02:32.489> come<00:02:32.610> back<00:02:32.640> to<00:02:32.790> the

00:02:32.869 --> 00:02:32.879 
temporarily now let's come back to the

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:34.850 
temporarily now let's come back to the
incandescent<00:02:33.180> and<00:02:33.720> you<00:02:34.290> notice<00:02:34.530> that<00:02:34.680> the

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
incandescent and you notice that the

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:37.280 
incandescent and you notice that the
intensity<00:02:35.400> right<00:02:35.700> now<00:02:35.879> is<00:02:36.030> set<00:02:36.180> to<00:02:36.299> zero<00:02:36.540> that

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
intensity right now is set to zero that

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:38.809 
intensity right now is set to zero that
as<00:02:37.440> we<00:02:37.560> start<00:02:37.769> to<00:02:37.799> bring<00:02:38.010> this<00:02:38.099> intensity<00:02:38.580> up

00:02:38.809 --> 00:02:38.819 
as we start to bring this intensity up

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:41.030 
as we start to bring this intensity up
this<00:02:39.599> object<00:02:40.170> starts<00:02:40.290> to<00:02:40.440> become<00:02:40.530> brighter

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
this object starts to become brighter

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.430 
this object starts to become brighter
and<00:02:41.280> brighter<00:02:41.790> to<00:02:42.150> the<00:02:42.239> point<00:02:42.450> where<00:02:42.629> as<00:02:42.840> we

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
and brighter to the point where as we

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:44.600 
and brighter to the point where as we
start<00:02:43.650> to<00:02:43.680> get<00:02:43.860> closer<00:02:44.069> to<00:02:44.159> one<00:02:44.370> it<00:02:44.489> really

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
start to get closer to one it really

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:45.740 
start to get closer to one it really
almost<00:02:44.849> kind<00:02:45.090> of<00:02:45.150> looks<00:02:45.329> as<00:02:45.450> though<00:02:45.599> this

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
almost kind of looks as though this

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:49.339 
almost kind of looks as though this
object<00:02:46.319> is<00:02:46.440> illuminated<00:02:47.430> or<00:02:47.670> lit<00:02:47.970> up<00:02:48.230> we<00:02:49.230> can

00:02:49.339 --> 00:02:49.349 
object is illuminated or lit up we can

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:50.330 
object is illuminated or lit up we can
also<00:02:49.470> start<00:02:49.709> to<00:02:49.769> come<00:02:49.950> in<00:02:50.040> and<00:02:50.129> give<00:02:50.220> this

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
also start to come in and give this

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:51.289 
also start to come in and give this
object<00:02:50.730> may<00:02:50.790> be<00:02:50.879> a<00:02:50.910> little<00:02:51.090> bit<00:02:51.209> more

00:02:51.289 --> 00:02:51.299 
object may be a little bit more

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:54.559 
object may be a little bit more
coloration<00:02:51.930> and<00:02:52.910> you<00:02:53.910> notice<00:02:54.150> in<00:02:54.239> my<00:02:54.359> case

00:02:54.559 --> 00:02:54.569 
coloration and you notice in my case

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:56.720 
coloration and you notice in my case
because<00:02:54.720> I<00:02:54.870> do<00:02:55.019> have<00:02:55.410> my<00:02:56.099> final<00:02:56.340> gathering

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
because I do have my final gathering

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:58.699 
because I do have my final gathering
turned<00:02:56.970> on<00:02:57.120> that<00:02:57.750> the<00:02:57.989> final<00:02:58.260> gathering<00:02:58.530> is

00:02:58.699 --> 00:02:58.709 
turned on that the final gathering is

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:00.319 
turned on that the final gathering is
actually<00:02:58.980> picking<00:02:59.280> up<00:02:59.400> on<00:02:59.519> this<00:02:59.670> and<00:02:59.910> making

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:00.329 
actually picking up on this and making

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:01.670 
actually picking up on this and making
some<00:03:00.599> of<00:03:00.660> these<00:03:00.720> areas<00:03:00.780> a<00:03:01.230> little<00:03:01.590> bit

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
some of these areas a little bit

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:04.490 
some of these areas a little bit
brighter<00:03:02.090> kind<00:03:03.090> of<00:03:03.180> close<00:03:03.660> to<00:03:03.930> this<00:03:04.109> piece<00:03:04.349> of

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
brighter kind of close to this piece of

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:06.140 
brighter kind of close to this piece of
geometry<00:03:04.680> so<00:03:05.129> it<00:03:05.220> really<00:03:05.459> does<00:03:05.700> try<00:03:05.910> to<00:03:05.970> behave

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
geometry so it really does try to behave

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:08.509 
geometry so it really does try to behave
as<00:03:06.540> though<00:03:07.140> it<00:03:07.319> is<00:03:07.500> some<00:03:07.739> kind<00:03:07.890> of<00:03:07.920> a<00:03:08.010> luminous

00:03:08.509 --> 00:03:08.519 
as though it is some kind of a luminous

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:11.990 
as though it is some kind of a luminous
surface<00:03:09.180> now<00:03:09.530> and<00:03:10.530> we<00:03:11.519> should<00:03:11.700> be<00:03:11.790> able<00:03:11.849> to

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 
surface now and we should be able to

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.839 
surface now and we should be able to
come<00:03:12.060> in<00:03:12.239> and<00:03:12.390> even<00:03:13.349> if<00:03:13.560> the<00:03:13.680> slider<00:03:14.579> right<00:03:14.790> now

00:03:14.839 --> 00:03:14.849 
come in and even if the slider right now

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:16.849 
come in and even if the slider right now
stops<00:03:15.239> at<00:03:15.390> one<00:03:15.540> we<00:03:16.290> should<00:03:16.470> be<00:03:16.560> able<00:03:16.620> to<00:03:16.769> come

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:16.859 
stops at one we should be able to come

00:03:16.859 --> 00:03:18.920 
stops at one we should be able to come
in<00:03:16.950> here<00:03:17.099> and<00:03:17.160> continue<00:03:17.879> increasing<00:03:18.209> this<00:03:18.690> if

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930 
in here and continue increasing this if

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:20.479 
in here and continue increasing this if
we<00:03:19.019> do<00:03:19.169> want<00:03:19.380> something<00:03:19.709> that<00:03:19.859> is<00:03:20.099> maybe<00:03:20.400> a

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:20.489 
we do want something that is maybe a

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:22.280 
we do want something that is maybe a
little<00:03:20.639> bit<00:03:20.819> brighter<00:03:21.090> than<00:03:21.870> what<00:03:22.079> we<00:03:22.169> have

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
little bit brighter than what we have

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:23.930 
little bit brighter than what we have
currently<00:03:22.530> and<00:03:23.190> you<00:03:23.280> can<00:03:23.400> really<00:03:23.609> start<00:03:23.849> to

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:23.940 
currently and you can really start to

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:25.789 
currently and you can really start to
see<00:03:24.090> now<00:03:24.239> where<00:03:24.480> we're<00:03:25.380> starting<00:03:25.530> to<00:03:25.709> get

00:03:25.789 --> 00:03:25.799 
see now where we're starting to get

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:27.589 
see now where we're starting to get
something<00:03:26.069> that<00:03:26.250> is<00:03:26.310> a<00:03:26.549> little<00:03:26.910> bit<00:03:27.030> more<00:03:27.359> like

00:03:27.589 --> 00:03:27.599 
something that is a little bit more like

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:29.150 
something that is a little bit more like
the<00:03:27.750> appearance<00:03:28.109> of<00:03:28.230> some<00:03:28.889> kind<00:03:28.950> of<00:03:29.040> an

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:29.160 
the appearance of some kind of an

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:32.900 
the appearance of some kind of an
illuminated<00:03:29.700> surface<00:03:31.160> so<00:03:32.160> if<00:03:32.400> we<00:03:32.489> want<00:03:32.669> to<00:03:32.730> we

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:32.910 
illuminated surface so if we want to we

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:35.420 
illuminated surface so if we want to we
could<00:03:33.030> go<00:03:33.209> ahead<00:03:33.299> and<00:03:33.419> turn<00:03:33.569> that<00:03:33.720> off<00:03:34.430> now

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:35.430 
could go ahead and turn that off now

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:37.550 
could go ahead and turn that off now
finally<00:03:35.880> we<00:03:36.090> have<00:03:36.269> the<00:03:36.299> ability<00:03:36.750> to<00:03:36.780> include

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:37.560 
finally we have the ability to include

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:39.650 
finally we have the ability to include
what's<00:03:37.799> called<00:03:38.010> translucency<00:03:38.940> now

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:39.660 
what's called translucency now

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:42.589 
what's called translucency now
translucency<00:03:40.470> are<00:03:40.769> would<00:03:41.760> be<00:03:41.880> surfaces<00:03:42.450> that

00:03:42.589 --> 00:03:42.599 
translucency are would be surfaces that

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:44.690 
translucency are would be surfaces that
are<00:03:42.660> really<00:03:43.169> not<00:03:43.319> necessarily<00:03:43.889> transparent

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:44.700 
are really not necessarily transparent

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:46.370 
are really not necessarily transparent
but<00:03:45.299> they<00:03:45.419> still<00:03:45.660> allow<00:03:45.930> light<00:03:46.169> to<00:03:46.200> pass

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:46.380 
but they still allow light to pass

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:47.750 
but they still allow light to pass
through<00:03:46.590> so<00:03:47.040> this<00:03:47.190> would<00:03:47.340> be<00:03:47.370> things<00:03:47.700> like

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760 
through so this would be things like

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:52.190 
through so this would be things like
cloth<00:03:48.680> paper<00:03:49.680> is<00:03:50.040> another<00:03:50.459> good<00:03:50.639> example<00:03:51.200> Jade

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:52.200 
cloth paper is another good example Jade

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:56.210 
cloth paper is another good example Jade
wax<00:03:53.180> things<00:03:54.180> like<00:03:54.359> that<00:03:54.950> so<00:03:55.950> to<00:03:56.040> demonstrate

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:56.220 
wax things like that so to demonstrate

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:58.430 
wax things like that so to demonstrate
this<00:03:56.669> let<00:03:57.629> me<00:03:57.690> go<00:03:57.810> ahead<00:03:57.900> and<00:03:58.019> jump<00:03:58.260> back<00:03:58.410> over

00:03:58.430 --> 00:03:58.440 
this let me go ahead and jump back over

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:01.039 
this let me go ahead and jump back over
to<00:03:58.889> this<00:03:59.040> little<00:03:59.280> memo<00:03:59.790> cam<00:04:00.030> right<00:04:00.870> up<00:04:01.019> here

00:04:01.039 --> 00:04:01.049 
to this little memo cam right up here

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:04.099 
to this little memo cam right up here
just<00:04:01.470> left<00:04:01.739> click<00:04:01.889> on<00:04:02.040> that<00:04:02.569> now<00:04:03.569> let's<00:04:03.900> select

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:04.109 
just left click on that now let's select

00:04:04.109 --> 00:04:06.589 
just left click on that now let's select
this<00:04:04.290> curtain<00:04:04.739> piece<00:04:05.250> of<00:04:05.400> geometry<00:04:05.579> and<00:04:06.060> let's

00:04:06.589 --> 00:04:06.599 
this curtain piece of geometry and let's

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:09.189 
this curtain piece of geometry and let's
go<00:04:06.690> to<00:04:06.750> its<00:04:06.959> material<00:04:07.500> so<00:04:07.739> alt<00:04:08.310> right<00:04:08.879> click

00:04:09.189 --> 00:04:09.199 
go to its material so alt right click

00:04:09.199 --> 00:04:13.339 
go to its material so alt right click
inspect<00:04:10.199> material<00:04:11.810> again<00:04:12.810> go<00:04:12.989> back<00:04:13.019> to<00:04:13.230> the

00:04:13.339 --> 00:04:13.349 
inspect material again go back to the

00:04:13.349 --> 00:04:16.310 
inspect material again go back to the
indirect<00:04:13.829> illumination<00:04:14.870> let's<00:04:15.870> draw<00:04:16.109> out<00:04:16.289> a

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:16.320 
indirect illumination let's draw out a

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:17.569 
indirect illumination let's draw out a
render<00:04:16.590> region<00:04:16.859> just<00:04:16.979> so<00:04:17.099> we<00:04:17.190> can<00:04:17.280> see<00:04:17.459> what

00:04:17.569 --> 00:04:17.579 
render region just so we can see what

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:20.150 
render region just so we can see what
this<00:04:17.669> looks<00:04:17.729> like<00:04:17.940> right<00:04:18.359> now<00:04:18.510> and<00:04:19.010> maybe<00:04:20.010> just

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:20.160 
this looks like right now and maybe just

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:21.529 
this looks like right now and maybe just
to<00:04:20.310> keep<00:04:20.430> my<00:04:20.579> render<00:04:20.910> moving<00:04:21.180> a<00:04:21.269> little<00:04:21.449> bit

00:04:21.529 --> 00:04:21.539 
to keep my render moving a little bit

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:24.380 
to keep my render moving a little bit
faster<00:04:22.019> I'll<00:04:22.409> go<00:04:22.680> back<00:04:22.800> and<00:04:23.039> disable<00:04:23.789> my<00:04:23.940> final

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:24.390 
faster I'll go back and disable my final

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:27.410 
faster I'll go back and disable my final
gather<00:04:24.890> there<00:04:25.890> we<00:04:26.010> are

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:27.420 
gather there we are

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:29.510 
gather there we are
now<00:04:27.480> back<00:04:27.720> to<00:04:27.870> the<00:04:27.900> translucency<00:04:28.530> but<00:04:29.400> we

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:29.520 
now back to the translucency but we

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:31.160 
now back to the translucency but we
should<00:04:29.730> see<00:04:29.940> now<00:04:30.120> as<00:04:30.270> we<00:04:30.390> start<00:04:30.690> to<00:04:30.810> dial<00:04:30.990> this

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:31.170 
should see now as we start to dial this

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:34.400 
should see now as we start to dial this
up<00:04:31.550> that<00:04:32.550> we<00:04:32.640> start<00:04:32.910> to<00:04:33.030> see<00:04:33.060> now<00:04:33.900> a<00:04:33.930> little<00:04:34.200> bit

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:34.410 
up that we start to see now a little bit

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:36.050 
up that we start to see now a little bit
more<00:04:34.560> of<00:04:34.620> that<00:04:34.740> translucent<00:04:35.340> effects<00:04:35.880> start

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:36.060 
more of that translucent effects start

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:37.790 
more of that translucent effects start
to<00:04:36.150> come<00:04:36.300> through<00:04:36.570> so<00:04:37.290> you<00:04:37.380> can<00:04:37.500> see<00:04:37.620> that<00:04:37.650> the

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:37.800 
to come through so you can see that the

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:39.530 
to come through so you can see that the
surface<00:04:38.220> again<00:04:38.520> is<00:04:38.670> not<00:04:38.820> really<00:04:39.150> necessarily

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:39.540 
surface again is not really necessarily

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:41.780 
surface again is not really necessarily
transparent<00:04:40.320> but<00:04:40.770> it<00:04:40.890> is<00:04:41.070> now<00:04:41.310> starting<00:04:41.610> to

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:41.790 
transparent but it is now starting to

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:44.170 
transparent but it is now starting to
allow<00:04:42.030> some<00:04:42.240> of<00:04:42.330> this<00:04:42.420> light<00:04:42.660> to<00:04:43.110> come<00:04:43.260> through

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:44.180 
allow some of this light to come through

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:47.030 
allow some of this light to come through
now<00:04:45.180> this<00:04:45.390> effect<00:04:45.750> really<00:04:46.110> works<00:04:46.380> best<00:04:46.680> for

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:47.040 
now this effect really works best for

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:48.590 
now this effect really works best for
surfaces<00:04:47.640> that<00:04:47.760> are<00:04:47.820> going<00:04:48.180> to<00:04:48.270> be<00:04:48.390> just

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:48.600 
surfaces that are going to be just

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:52.130 
surfaces that are going to be just
single<00:04:48.990> sided<00:04:49.280> so<00:04:50.280> things<00:04:50.730> like<00:04:50.850> grids<00:04:51.270> or

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:52.140 
single sided so things like grids or

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:54.020 
single sided so things like grids or
really<00:04:52.860> any<00:04:53.040> surface<00:04:53.430> that<00:04:53.460> really<00:04:53.850> doesn't

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:54.030 
really any surface that really doesn't

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:56.060 
really any surface that really doesn't
have<00:04:54.300> any<00:04:54.630> kind<00:04:54.810> of<00:04:54.930> thickness<00:04:55.410> to<00:04:55.590> it<00:04:55.620> at<00:04:55.860> all

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:56.070 
have any kind of thickness to it at all

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:58.160 
have any kind of thickness to it at all
again<00:04:56.850> you<00:04:56.970> can<00:04:57.090> see<00:04:57.120> in<00:04:57.390> this<00:04:57.510> situation<00:04:57.810> that

00:04:58.160 --> 00:04:58.170 
again you can see in this situation that

00:04:58.170 --> 00:05:00.680 
again you can see in this situation that
this<00:04:58.350> is<00:04:58.500> really<00:04:58.680> just<00:04:58.890> a<00:04:59.100> single<00:04:59.630> kind<00:05:00.630> of

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:00.690 
this is really just a single kind of

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:03.410 
this is really just a single kind of
plane<00:05:01.020> or<00:05:01.260> a<00:05:01.470> grid<00:05:01.740> type<00:05:01.980> surface<00:05:02.370> now<00:05:03.240> this

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:03.420 
plane or a grid type surface now this

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:05.510 
plane or a grid type surface now this
will<00:05:03.570> work<00:05:03.780> just<00:05:03.990> fine<00:05:04.080> with<00:05:04.500> surfaces<00:05:05.370> that

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:05.520 
will work just fine with surfaces that

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:07.940 
will work just fine with surfaces that
do<00:05:05.700> have<00:05:05.910> thickness<00:05:06.480> but<00:05:07.200> the<00:05:07.440> effect<00:05:07.770> is

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:07.950 
do have thickness but the effect is

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:10.340 
do have thickness but the effect is
going<00:05:08.400> to<00:05:08.520> be<00:05:08.670> much<00:05:09.450> less<00:05:09.660> noticeable<00:05:10.050> and

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:10.350 
going to be much less noticeable and

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:12.500 
going to be much less noticeable and
takes<00:05:10.830> a<00:05:10.920> little<00:05:11.070> bit<00:05:11.220> more<00:05:11.460> work<00:05:12.120> to<00:05:12.180> get<00:05:12.390> it

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:12.510 
takes a little bit more work to get it

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:14.870 
takes a little bit more work to get it
looking<00:05:12.720> just<00:05:12.780> right<00:05:13.280> so<00:05:14.280> that's<00:05:14.490> a<00:05:14.580> look<00:05:14.730> at

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:14.880 
looking just right so that's a look at

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:16.160 
looking just right so that's a look at
