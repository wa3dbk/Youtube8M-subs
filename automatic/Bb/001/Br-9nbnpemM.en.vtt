00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
I think one of the best of the season I

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.790 
I think one of the best of the season I
mean<00:00:30.090> obviously<00:00:30.210> Danny's<00:00:30.810> was<00:00:30.990> a<00:00:31.019> amazing

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
mean obviously Danny's was a amazing

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.920 
mean obviously Danny's was a amazing
goal<00:00:31.949> that's<00:00:32.070> going<00:00:32.219> to<00:00:32.279> happen<00:00:32.460> once<00:00:32.930> but

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
goal that's going to happen once but

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.470 
goal that's going to happen once but
Juan<00:00:34.079> Pablos<00:00:34.500> against<00:00:34.800> LA<00:00:35.070> Galaxy<00:00:35.550> or<00:00:35.730> he<00:00:36.300> had

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
Juan Pablos against LA Galaxy or he had

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.270 
Juan Pablos against LA Galaxy or he had
troubled<00:00:37.110> the<00:00:37.260> defender<00:00:37.770> and<00:00:37.829> then<00:00:37.950> ship<00:00:38.129> the

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
troubled the defender and then ship the

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.150 
troubled the defender and then ship the
goalie<00:00:38.460> I<00:00:38.610> mean<00:00:38.820> to<00:00:39.719> watch<00:00:39.930> that<00:00:40.200> I<00:00:40.260> was<00:00:40.620> that

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
goalie I mean to watch that I was that

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.040 
goalie I mean to watch that I was that
was<00:00:41.280> humping<00:00:41.550> maybe<00:00:42.450> a<00:00:42.540> little<00:00:42.660> bit<00:00:42.809> cheesy

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
was humping maybe a little bit cheesy

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.569 
was humping maybe a little bit cheesy
but<00:00:43.200> I<00:00:43.379> think<00:00:43.590> just<00:00:43.800> Dave<00:00:43.950> Vandenberg's<00:00:44.399> goal

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.580 
but I think just Dave Vandenberg's goal
against<00:00:44.820> salt<00:00:45.000> lake<00:00:45.180> as<00:00:45.930> simple<00:00:46.230> as<00:00:46.289> it<00:00:46.440> was

against salt lake as simple as it was
but<00:00:46.829> i<00:00:46.890> thought<00:00:47.039> was<00:00:47.190> big<00:00:47.399> goal<00:00:47.579> obviously<00:00:47.789> for

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:04.479 
chanting chanting Danny felt a little

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:07.680 
chanting chanting Danny felt a little
reminiscent<00:02:05.229> of<00:02:05.350> Rudy<00:02:06.100> I<00:02:06.280> actually<00:02:06.789> you<00:02:07.600> know

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:10.979 
I think Danny's is something that we're
not<00:02:09.670> going<00:02:09.880> to<00:02:09.970> forget<00:02:10.239> I<00:02:10.509> mean<00:02:10.750> it's<00:02:10.959> the

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:10.989 
not going to forget I mean it's the

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:12.630 
not going to forget I mean it's the
first<00:02:11.320> for<00:02:11.680> any<00:02:11.800> goalkeeper<00:02:12.310> in<00:02:12.400> the<00:02:12.459> league's

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.640 
first for any goalkeeper in the league's

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:15.780 
first for any goalkeeper in the league's
I<00:02:12.940> think<00:02:13.180> that<00:02:13.360> was<00:02:13.510> pretty<00:02:14.350> amazing<00:02:14.560> and<00:02:15.459> then

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:15.790 
I think that was pretty amazing and then

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:17.310 
I think that was pretty amazing and then
I<00:02:16.000> liked<00:02:16.269> Juan<00:02:16.450> Pablos<00:02:16.780> free-kick<00:02:17.170> of

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:17.320 
I liked Juan Pablos free-kick of

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:19.350 
I liked Juan Pablos free-kick of
Columbus<00:02:17.739> I<00:02:17.920> thought<00:02:18.580> that<00:02:18.640> was<00:02:18.910> a<00:02:18.940> heck<00:02:19.150> of<00:02:19.180> a

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.360 
Columbus I thought that was a heck of a

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:21.930 
Columbus I thought that was a heck of a
role<00:02:19.540> and<00:02:19.840> you<00:02:20.440> know<00:02:20.560> from<00:02:20.890> that<00:02:21.220> distance<00:02:21.610> and

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:21.940 
role and you know from that distance and

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:24.090 
role and you know from that distance and
hit<00:02:22.540> it<00:02:22.660> over<00:02:22.780> the<00:02:22.870> wall<00:02:22.959> and<00:02:23.140> you<00:02:23.739> know<00:02:23.830> kind

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:24.100 
hit it over the wall and you know kind

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:25.470 
hit it over the wall and you know kind
of<00:02:24.130> an<00:02:24.250> uh<00:02:24.340> Claire<00:02:24.550> and<00:02:24.730> I<00:02:24.970> thought<00:02:25.180> that<00:02:25.330> was<00:02:25.450> a

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480 
of an uh Claire and I thought that was a

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:28.080 
of an uh Claire and I thought that was a
pretty<00:02:25.540> impressive<00:02:25.870> goal<00:02:26.700> so<00:02:27.700> I<00:02:27.730> think<00:02:27.850> those

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.090 
pretty impressive goal so I think those

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:34.020 
pretty impressive goal so I think those
two<00:02:28.150> kind<00:02:28.480> of<00:02:28.570> stand<00:02:28.750> out<00:02:28.950> rhythm<00:02:29.950> goal<00:02:33.030> Danny

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.030 
two kind of stand out rhythm goal Danny

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:53.050 
two kind of stand out rhythm goal Danny
superiors

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:53.060
