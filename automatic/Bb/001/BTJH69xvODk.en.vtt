00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810 
where I'm at right now the next stage is

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:29.710 
where I'm at right now the next stage is
I'm<00:02:26.960> going<00:02:27.080> to<00:02:27.140> go<00:02:27.260> ahead<00:02:27.320> and<00:02:27.470> start<00:02:28.720> getting

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:29.720 
I'm going to go ahead and start getting

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:31.150 
I'm going to go ahead and start getting
some<00:02:29.750> base<00:02:30.080> coats<00:02:30.410> on<00:02:30.620> these<00:02:30.800> with<00:02:31.010> these

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:31.160 
some base coats on these with these

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:34.870 
some base coats on these with these
parts<00:02:31.580> here<00:02:32.470> get<00:02:33.470> let<00:02:33.890> that<00:02:34.070> paint<00:02:34.400> cure<00:02:34.670> up

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:34.880 
parts here get let that paint cure up

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:39.430 
parts here get let that paint cure up
add<00:02:35.240> my<00:02:36.050> liquid<00:02:36.650> mask<00:02:37.040> and<00:02:37.340> salt<00:02:37.940> to<00:02:38.270> that<00:02:38.450> so

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:39.440 
add my liquid mask and salt to that so

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:41.850 
add my liquid mask and salt to that so
that<00:02:39.470> I<00:02:39.620> can<00:02:39.830> get<00:02:39.980> some<00:02:40.160> really<00:02:40.400> good<00:02:41.270> chipping

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:41.860 
that I can get some really good chipping

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:45.760 
that I can get some really good chipping
on<00:02:42.860> this<00:02:43.070> this<00:02:43.520> bad<00:02:43.730> boy<00:02:44.000> so<00:02:44.330> that's<00:02:44.840> a<00:02:45.110> Santa's

on this this bad boy so that's a Santa's

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:50.020 
on this this bad boy so that's a Santa's
 yeah<00:02:46.900> so<00:02:48.010> anyway<00:02:49.010> that<00:02:49.160> is<00:02:49.310> it<00:02:49.340> for<00:02:49.640> now<00:02:49.670> I

of<00:02:53.780> an<00:02:53.840> update<00:02:54.020> yet<00:02:54.590> but<00:02:55.900> this<00:02:56.900> one's<00:02:57.110> uh

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:57.260 
of an update yet but this one's uh

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:00.040 
of an update yet but this one's uh
moving<00:02:57.620> along<00:02:57.830> a<00:02:58.160> little<00:02:58.370> slow<00:02:58.610> even<00:02:59.060> I'd<00:02:59.810> like

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:00.050

that<00:03:18.890> this<00:03:19.330> target<00:03:20.330> here<00:03:20.480> kind<00:03:20.690> of<00:03:20.750> I'm<00:03:20.960> gonna

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:21.050 
that this target here kind of I'm gonna

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:23.740 
that this target here kind of I'm gonna
leave<00:03:21.560> this<00:03:21.910> I'm<00:03:22.910> not<00:03:23.090> going<00:03:23.240> to<00:03:23.300> glue<00:03:23.510> these

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:23.750 
leave this I'm not going to glue these

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:26.530 
leave this I'm not going to glue these
two<00:03:24.080> halves<00:03:24.320> together<00:03:24.850> so<00:03:25.850> that<00:03:26.060> I<00:03:26.090> can<00:03:26.390> always

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:26.540 
two halves together so that I can always

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:29.850 
two halves together so that I can always
come<00:03:27.020> in<00:03:27.200> and<00:03:27.580> access<00:03:28.580> my<00:03:28.820> battery<00:03:29.240> pack<00:03:29.480> and

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:29.860 
come in and access my battery pack and

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:33.490 
come in and access my battery pack and
the<00:03:30.860> fiber<00:03:31.340> optics<00:03:31.820> if<00:03:31.970> I<00:03:32.060> have<00:03:32.300> to<00:03:32.510> you<00:03:32.600> so<00:03:33.350> as

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:33.500 
the fiber optics if I have to you so as

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:36.910 
the fiber optics if I have to you so as
long<00:03:33.650> as<00:03:33.830> this<00:03:34.930> decides<00:03:35.930> to<00:03:36.260> just<00:03:36.620> snap<00:03:36.890> right

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:36.920 
long as this decides to just snap right

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:40.120 
long as this decides to just snap right
back<00:03:37.280> into<00:03:37.460> place<00:03:38.020> I'm<00:03:39.020> not<00:03:39.080> going<00:03:39.620> to<00:03:39.680> really

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:40.130 
back into place I'm not going to really

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:44.830 
back into place I'm not going to really
worry<00:03:40.460> about<00:03:40.550> gluing<00:03:41.120> it<00:03:41.240> in<00:03:41.709> because<00:03:43.150> as<00:03:44.150> all

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:44.840 
worry about gluing it in because as all

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:46.300 
worry about gluing it in because as all
my<00:03:45.020> look<00:03:45.230> I'm<00:03:45.440> starting<00:03:45.709> to<00:03:45.800> find<00:03:46.010> out<00:03:46.130> with

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:46.310 
my look I'm starting to find out with

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:49.150 
my look I'm starting to find out with
all<00:03:46.430> my<00:03:46.610> electronics<00:03:47.209> jobs<00:03:47.570> that<00:03:48.160> eventually

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:49.160 
all my electronics jobs that eventually

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:50.260 
all my electronics jobs that eventually
I'm<00:03:49.250> going<00:03:49.340> to<00:03:49.400> have<00:03:49.490> to<00:03:49.640> go<00:03:49.760> in<00:03:49.850> there<00:03:49.970> and<00:03:50.090> fix

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:50.270 
I'm going to have to go in there and fix

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:53.140 
I'm going to have to go in there and fix
it<00:03:51.040> because<00:03:52.040> I'm<00:03:52.220> not<00:03:52.250> the<00:03:52.550> best<00:03:52.820> that<00:03:53.000> there

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:02.240 
at electronic work so that little bit

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:03.490 
at electronic work so that little bit
right<00:04:02.270> there<00:04:02.660> is<00:04:02.810> actually<00:04:02.990> going<00:04:03.260> to<00:04:03.380> be

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:03.500 
right there is actually going to be

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:06.250 
right there is actually going to be
pretty<00:04:04.459> helpful<00:04:04.850> kind<00:04:05.480> of<00:04:05.540> glad<00:04:05.720> that<00:04:05.750> fine

mold<00:04:06.790> went<00:04:07.790> through<00:04:07.940> the<00:04:08.060> trouble<00:04:08.390> of

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:08.450 
mold went through the trouble of

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:10.150 
mold went through the trouble of
actually<00:04:08.600> giving<00:04:08.959> us<00:04:09.200> a<00:04:09.350> little<00:04:09.590> platform<00:04:09.830> to

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:10.160 
actually giving us a little platform to

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:14.230 
actually giving us a little platform to
work<00:04:10.310> on<00:04:11.560> so<00:04:12.560> I'm<00:04:13.400> not<00:04:13.430> sure<00:04:13.790> that's<00:04:13.970> really

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:14.240 
work on so I'm not sure that's really

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:16.870 
work on so I'm not sure that's really
how<00:04:14.450> they<00:04:14.630> engineered<00:04:14.870> it<00:04:15.230> but<00:04:15.470> it<00:04:16.190> works<00:04:16.580> for

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:16.880 
how they engineered it but it works for

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:19.060 
how they engineered it but it works for
me<00:04:16.940> so<00:04:17.420> I<00:04:17.690> will<00:04:17.959> see<00:04:18.260> y'all<00:04:18.440> later<00:04:18.470> y'all<00:04:18.890> have

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:19.070
