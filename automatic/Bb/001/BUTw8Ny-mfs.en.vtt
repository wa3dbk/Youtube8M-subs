I<00:02:05.460> love<00:02:06.360> the<00:02:06.510> wildlife<00:02:06.840> biology<00:02:07.530> program<00:02:07.560> here

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
I love the wildlife biology program here

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.360 
I love the wildlife biology program here
the<00:02:08.640> faculty<00:02:09.330> are<00:02:09.479> all<00:02:09.660> amazing<00:02:10.500> scientists

recommend<00:02:18.300> the<00:02:18.780> University<00:02:18.900> of<00:02:19.290> Montana<00:02:19.920> to

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
recommend the University of Montana to

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:22.790 
recommend the University of Montana to
anyone<00:02:20.610> who<00:02:20.760> is<00:02:20.880> considering<00:02:21.450> it<00:02:21.600> if<00:02:22.470> I<00:02:22.560> look

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 
anyone who is considering it if I look

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.010 
anyone who is considering it if I look
at<00:02:22.890> myself<00:02:23.040> when<00:02:23.430> I<00:02:23.520> first<00:02:23.550> started<00:02:24.240> I<00:02:24.450> feel

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:25.020 
at myself when I first started I feel

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:26.480 
at myself when I first started I feel
like<00:02:25.140> a<00:02:25.170> completely<00:02:25.590> different<00:02:25.710> person<00:02:26.100> but

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:26.490 
like a completely different person but

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:29.930 
like a completely different person but
in<00:02:26.580> a<00:02:26.670> good<00:02:26.820> way<00:02:27.000> I<00:02:27.240> feel<00:02:27.630> like<00:02:27.840> I<00:02:28.640> have<00:02:29.640> gained

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
in a good way I feel like I have gained

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:32.060 
in a good way I feel like I have gained
so<00:02:30.120> much<00:02:30.510> more<00:02:30.750> than<00:02:31.410> I<00:02:31.500> originally<00:02:31.590> thought<00:02:31.950> I

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:32.070 
so much more than I originally thought I

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:35.300 
so much more than I originally thought I
would<00:02:33.050> this<00:02:34.050> would<00:02:34.230> be<00:02:34.350> a<00:02:34.380> wonderful<00:02:34.830> time<00:02:35.070> to

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
would this would be a wonderful time to

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:37.850 
would this would be a wonderful time to
come<00:02:35.910> in<00:02:36.090> as<00:02:36.270> a<00:02:36.300> wildlife<00:02:36.780> biology<00:02:37.290> undergrad

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
come in as a wildlife biology undergrad

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:39.650 
come in as a wildlife biology undergrad
just<00:02:38.400> the<00:02:38.550> combination<00:02:39.150> of<00:02:39.240> these<00:02:39.420> new

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660 
just the combination of these new

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:41.750 
just the combination of these new
resources<00:02:39.900> would<00:02:40.620> combine<00:02:41.280> with<00:02:41.640> the

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
resources would combine with the

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.390 
resources would combine with the
existing<00:02:42.270> strengths<00:02:42.840> in<00:02:42.990> the<00:02:43.110> program<00:02:43.530> we<00:02:44.370> are

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
existing strengths in the program we are

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:47.180 
existing strengths in the program we are
training<00:02:45.209> the<00:02:45.420> next<00:02:45.600> generation<00:02:45.720> of<00:02:46.350> wildlife

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
training the next generation of wildlife

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:49.520 
training the next generation of wildlife
biologists<00:02:47.880> right<00:02:48.060> now<00:02:48.240> we've<00:02:48.900> already<00:02:49.140> been

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
biologists right now we've already been

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:51.410 
biologists right now we've already been
recognized<00:02:50.160> as<00:02:50.430> one<00:02:50.459> of<00:02:50.700> the<00:02:50.790> best<00:02:51.000> places<00:02:51.270> in

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
recognized as one of the best places in

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:54.920 
recognized as one of the best places in
the<00:02:51.600> nation<00:02:51.870> to<00:02:52.709> get<00:02:52.980> that<00:02:53.160> training<00:02:53.459> and<00:02:53.930> with

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
the nation to get that training and with

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:58.280 
the nation to get that training and with
this<00:02:55.050> distinction<00:02:55.620> we<00:02:55.740> just<00:02:55.920> got<00:02:56.070> better
