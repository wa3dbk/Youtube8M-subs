crazy<00:01:59.049> how<00:01:59.319> I<00:01:59.350> found<00:01:59.530> out<00:01:59.649> after<00:02:00.009> patch<00:02:00.189> and<00:02:00.670> I

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:00.700 
crazy how I found out after patch and I

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:02.730 
crazy how I found out after patch and I
was<00:02:01.210> kind<00:02:01.360> of<00:02:01.390> stupid<00:02:01.659> to<00:02:01.990> when<00:02:02.200> I<00:02:02.229> found<00:02:02.469> this

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:02.740 
was kind of stupid to when I found this

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:05.399 
was kind of stupid to when I found this
but<00:02:03.069> ya<00:02:03.579> gotta<00:02:03.789> see<00:02:04.240> that<00:02:04.479> bomb<00:02:04.719> is<00:02:04.750> a<00:02:04.929> visible

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:05.409
