no socks multi vault that's a sad
omission<00:00:44.010> but<00:00:44.220> what<00:00:44.460> is<00:00:44.610> cool<00:00:44.910> is<00:00:45.150> that<00:00:45.180> the

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
omission but what is cool is that the

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.810 
omission but what is cool is that the
tables<00:00:46.290> that<00:00:46.500> you<00:00:46.650> already<00:00:46.890> own<00:00:47.190> for<00:00:47.220> pinball

compatible<00:00:50.940> with<00:00:51.690> pinball<00:00:52.470> fx2<00:00:53.210> so<00:00:54.210> you<00:00:54.300> can

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
compatible with pinball fx2 so you can

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.390 
compatible with pinball fx2 so you can
just<00:00:54.600> reinforce<00:00:55.170> those<00:00:55.409> and<00:00:55.710> what<00:00:56.250> we're

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:56.400 
just reinforce those and what we're

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:58.850 
just reinforce those and what we're
watching<00:00:56.820> here<00:00:57.180> is<00:00:57.390> one<00:00:57.780> of<00:00:57.900> the<00:00:58.019> tables<00:00:58.230> from

first half of this review is Rome also
in<00:01:11.970> the<00:01:12.120> core<00:01:12.390> collection<00:01:12.690> they<00:01:13.409> claim<00:01:13.710> that

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
in the core collection they claim that

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.320 
in the core collection they claim that
there's<00:01:14.070> a<00:01:14.130> new<00:01:14.280> physics<00:01:14.729> engine<00:01:15.150> and

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
there's a new physics engine and

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.210 
there's a new physics engine and
improved<00:01:15.810> physics<00:01:16.290> I<00:01:16.380> didn't<00:01:16.830> think<00:01:17.070> they

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
improved physics I didn't think they

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.640 
improved physics I didn't think they
were<00:01:17.280> bad<00:01:17.550> the<00:01:17.760> first<00:01:18.000> time<00:01:18.420> the<00:01:19.080> game<00:01:19.290> plays

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
were bad the first time the game plays

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.920 
were bad the first time the game plays
like<00:01:20.250> you'd<00:01:20.610> expect<00:01:20.729> it<00:01:21.120> to<00:01:21.240> it's<00:01:21.450> really<00:01:21.750> good

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
like you'd expect it to it's really good

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.319 
like you'd expect it to it's really good
I'm<00:01:22.290> a<00:01:22.409> huge<00:01:22.649> fan<00:01:22.829> of<00:01:22.890> the<00:01:23.250> pinball<00:01:23.490> FX<00:01:24.000> games

they're<00:01:27.869> wild<00:01:28.110> tables<00:01:28.619> they<00:01:28.799> take<00:01:28.979> a<00:01:29.009> long

they're wild tables they take a long

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.069 
they're wild tables they take a long
time<00:01:29.520> to<00:01:29.729> master<00:01:29.939> and<00:01:30.270> figure<00:01:30.570> out<00:01:30.630> what<00:01:30.899> it<00:01:31.020> is

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
time to master and figure out what it is

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:32.990 
time to master and figure out what it is
you're<00:01:31.259> supposed<00:01:31.619> to<00:01:31.710> do<00:01:31.890> and<00:01:32.280> do<00:01:32.640> things<00:01:32.850> that

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
you're supposed to do and do things that

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.179 
you're supposed to do and do things that
are<00:01:33.119> just<00:01:33.479> simply<00:01:33.930> not<00:01:33.960> possible<00:01:34.380> on<00:01:34.920> a<00:01:34.950> real

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
are just simply not possible on a real

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:44.219 
are just simply not possible on a real
pinball<00:01:35.610> table

00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:44.229 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:47.290 

the<00:01:45.229> noticeable<00:01:45.680> changes<00:01:46.190> are<00:01:46.550> a<00:01:46.580> mixed<00:01:47.119> bag

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:47.300 
the noticeable changes are a mixed bag

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:48.670 
the noticeable changes are a mixed bag
some<00:01:47.570> of<00:01:47.690> which<00:01:47.840> I<00:01:47.990> think<00:01:48.200> are<00:01:48.320> really<00:01:48.409> cool

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:48.680 
some of which I think are really cool

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:50.770 
some of which I think are really cool
others<00:01:48.979> are<00:01:49.190> completely<00:01:49.760> unnecessary

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:50.780 
others are completely unnecessary

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:52.630 
others are completely unnecessary
like<00:01:51.140> the<00:01:51.290> constant<00:01:51.770> reminders<00:01:52.190> about<00:01:52.340> your

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:52.640 
like the constant reminders about your

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:55.030 
like the constant reminders about your
super<00:01:53.000> score<00:01:53.330> the<00:01:53.930> constant<00:01:54.470> competition

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:55.040 
super score the constant competition

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:57.460 
super score the constant competition
against<00:01:55.430> your<00:01:55.580> friends<00:01:56.150> and<00:01:56.390> the<00:01:56.869> constant

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:57.470 
against your friends and the constant

00:01:57.470 --> 00:01:59.859 
against your friends and the constant
reminders<00:01:58.130> in<00:01:58.310> general<00:01:59.240> I<00:01:59.360> think<00:01:59.390> those<00:01:59.720> could

00:01:59.859 --> 00:01:59.869 
reminders in general I think those could

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:01.149 
reminders in general I think those could
be<00:01:59.930> done<00:02:00.140> away<00:02:00.259> with<00:02:00.560> maybe<00:02:00.770> there's<00:02:01.040> an

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:01.159 
be done away with maybe there's an

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:02.440 
be done away with maybe there's an
option<00:02:01.460> I<00:02:01.520> guess<00:02:01.550> I<00:02:01.880> haven't<00:02:02.090> really<00:02:02.270> spent

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:02.450 
option I guess I haven't really spent

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:03.760 
option I guess I haven't really spent
that<00:02:02.570> much<00:02:02.750> time<00:02:02.780> looking<00:02:03.259> for<00:02:03.470> it<00:02:03.530> it's<00:02:03.710> not

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:03.770 
that much time looking for it it's not

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:05.770 
that much time looking for it it's not
that<00:02:04.009> distracting<00:02:04.640> there's<00:02:05.360> a<00:02:05.450> local

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:05.780 
that distracting there's a local
