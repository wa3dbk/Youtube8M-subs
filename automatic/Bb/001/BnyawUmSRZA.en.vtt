 [music] 

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:17.030
 Good day 

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:19.800
 I'll start by telling you a little 

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:25.230
 short little such lyric 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:28.850
 story one morning the player under the nickname 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:32.489
 Stas he woke up with a good mood 

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:35.579
 went wash wash go brush your teeth 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:40.550
 turned on the game clash of clans and decided 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:43.589
 conduct your first attack on anyone 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:46.050
 rival he had 8 tons hall he took 

00:00:43.589 --> 00:00:49.620
 three lightning took the dragons clan castl 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:54.829
 balls and went to beat him in general then 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:57.839
 at first nothing foreshadowed trouble and 

00:00:54.829 --> 00:01:00.800
 everything went pretty cool 

00:00:57.839 --> 00:01:04.710
 almost all defenses demolished 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:06.930
 three dragon survivors which of course 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.450
 not so little probably everything went as 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.799
 I would like to tone the hall remained in the center but 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:14.219
 in general, three dragons 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:17.340
 so systematically confidently destroy 

00:01:14.219 --> 00:01:19.680
 everything in its path and judging by their 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.780
 they are not particularly in danger 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:26.820
 of those defenses that are here 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:30.450
 left here but we still have 52 50 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:33.329
 seconds before the end of the battle and here already 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:38.520
 player under the name stas he started a little 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:41.579
 nervous but still the chance remains and 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:45.210
 when the dragon flies to the king that he 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:50.549
 there is already an obvious hope here 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:52.890
 10 seconds left and 99 percent base in 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:55.530
 Generally demolished and 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:57.750
 5 seconds left in five seconds three 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:04.420
 dragon should just bast made to 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:07.720
 this town hall but now 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:10.060
 We rotate the focus actually on the 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:12.340
 how much is the town hall life and three 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:15.670
 dragon pancakes couldn't handle 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:17.890
 town hall m 99 percent and town hall in 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:20.230
 center is worth it just epically 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:21.970
 now without any lyric tales 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:25.120
 who just made up just 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:28.569
 let's take another look at this one just 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:32.140
 damn it before i like that when when 

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:34.420
 me a player under the name Amanda Amanda he 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:37.000
 said that there is such an epic 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:39.850
 so which damn should be written on 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.160
 the movie is there 99 percent and the dude could not 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:44.319
 demolish town hall 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:47.500
 that I thought that dublin at town hall nyc 

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:50.549
 Well, how would such a thing that happens 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:53.799
 yes very often that 99 percent and 

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:55.360
 a little less often but also happens when 99 

00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:59.709
 percent and not demolished town hall 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:03.310
 but when when the situation occurs in 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:05.440
 which polina but I do not know on the last 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:07.269
 seconds the dragon is already near tons of hall 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:09.400
 and let's just pay attention to 

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:11.920
 one single moment that me 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:17.890
 here in this story just killed 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:19.780
 Look closely at the lives 1 1 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:22.450
 the second to the end remains to see here 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:25.090
 end of repeat is written 1 second 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:27.280
 one second to the end and look at hbk 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:29.829
 here just pay attention I would with this 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:32.530
 picture a bunch of memes would have made up in my 

00:03:29.829 --> 00:03:34.390
 the group will be exactly how mu 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:38.829
 generally screw it up in full 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:43.000
 I just do not know I just have no words 

00:03:38.829 --> 00:03:44.680
 This is a pancake, I personally have never 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:48.459
 never seen exactly like that 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:49.140
 context that one second before the end 

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:51.970
 fight 

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:54.190
 life remains i percentage 

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:56.950
 I'm afraid to even try here at least on 

00:03:54.190 --> 00:04:01.810
 one percent or is this one 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:03.850
 percent and dude takes one star 99 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:07.260
 percent knock out they demolish the town hall 

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:09.370
 but this is the very moment when you remember 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:12.280
 there were rumors of a future update 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:13.690
 They said that they would introduce an update in which 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:17.989
 will be there 

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:20.840
 for example from this 99 well there knocked out 

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:23.210
 for example 33 percent is one star 66 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:25.720
 percent the second star is for example 100 

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:28.520
 percent this is already 3 stars this is the same 

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:30.950
 not very common 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:35.560
 and a rare case when it would be very 

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:35.560
 by the way because one star for this 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:40.280
 generally 

00:04:37.389 --> 00:04:42.770
 dude under the name Stason ya devi really 

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:43.940
 I sympathize very much but did not want either 

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:47.120
 what to offend on such 

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:49.970
 this is not to shoot it just fucking pipets 

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:53.320
 general guys let you accompany life 

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:56.090
 success with antifreeze you too 

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:58.760
 good luck as they say is also useful yes 

00:04:56.090 --> 00:05:00.650
 Well, damn it, I don't know anything for me 

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:02.930
 just add i when just the first 

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:04.760
 just looked right up to this point and 

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:07.370
 I caught exactly this moment where 

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:11.810
 one second to the end remains and 

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:13.669
 the number of lives I do not know that's me 

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:15.620
 nothing to say such situations because 

00:05:13.669 --> 00:05:18.550
 what is there just nothing to add 

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:21.050
 in general, something like this if you liked 

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:23.030

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:26.229

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:26.229
