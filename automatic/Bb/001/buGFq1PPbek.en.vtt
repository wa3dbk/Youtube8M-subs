however<00:04:49.760> the<00:04:50.120> confusion<00:04:50.660> and<00:04:50.780> blind<00:04:51.020> mechanic

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:51.500 
however the confusion and blind mechanic

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:53.260 
however the confusion and blind mechanic
do<00:04:51.680> provide<00:04:52.010> a<00:04:52.039> marginal<00:04:52.580> amount<00:04:52.729> of<00:04:52.910> control
