00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
something a bit different this time in

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.850 
something a bit different this time in
positioning<00:01:06.090> from<00:01:06.390> build<00:01:06.720> up<00:01:06.869> play<00:01:07.049> will<00:01:07.619> go

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
crosses and shots and by having around

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.780 
crosses and shots and by having around
fifty<00:01:27.750> of<00:01:27.869> these<00:01:28.080> options<00:01:28.520> ensures<00:01:29.520> us<00:01:29.549> that

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
fifty of these options ensures us that

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.420 
fifty of these options ensures us that
this<00:01:30.240> is<00:01:30.450> exactly<00:01:31.079> what<00:01:31.350> will<00:01:31.590> happen<00:01:32.070> of

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
this is exactly what will happen of

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:33.980 
this is exactly what will happen of
course<00:01:32.490> now<00:01:32.939> if<00:01:33.240> you<00:01:33.420> are<00:01:33.570> a<00:01:33.600> player<00:01:33.960> that

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
course now if you are a player that

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.560 
course now if you are a player that
crosses<00:01:34.770> a<00:01:34.890> lot<00:01:35.009> you<00:01:35.250> can<00:01:35.400> tweak<00:01:35.670> it<00:01:35.700> and<00:01:36.060> put

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
crosses a lot you can tweak it and put

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.120 
crosses a lot you can tweak it and put
more<00:01:36.810> at<00:01:36.990> crossing<00:01:37.500> if<00:01:37.650> you<00:01:37.680> are<00:01:37.829> a<00:01:37.860> player

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
more at crossing if you are a player

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.370 
more at crossing if you are a player
that<00:01:38.159> never<00:01:38.939> crosses<00:01:39.420> you<00:01:39.570> can<00:01:39.750> lower<00:01:40.140> the

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
that never crosses you can lower the

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.980 
that never crosses you can lower the
value<00:01:41.009> and<00:01:41.189> so<00:01:41.670> on<00:01:41.700> depending<00:01:42.150> on<00:01:42.810> your

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
value and so on depending on your

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
particular game style but I would advise

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.039 
particular game style but I would advise
you<00:01:46.200> to<00:01:46.229> keep<00:01:46.619> it<00:01:46.890> like<00:01:47.130> this<00:01:47.430> as<00:01:47.790> I<00:01:48.390> explained

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
you to keep it like this as I explained

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:52.399 
you to keep it like this as I explained
it<00:01:49.229> for<00:01:49.259> the<00:01:49.680> 4-3-3<00:01:50.280> formation<00:01:51.290> regarding<00:01:52.290> the

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
it for the 4-3-3 formation regarding the

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:55.130 
it for the 4-3-3 formation regarding the
defensive<00:01:53.220> options<00:01:53.759> will<00:01:54.329> keep<00:01:54.540> the<00:01:54.780> same

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
defensive options will keep the same

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.980 
defensive options will keep the same
ideas<00:01:55.619> as<00:01:55.829> in<00:01:56.250> our<00:01:56.369> previous<00:01:56.820> videos<00:01:57.479> low

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
ideas as in our previous videos low

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.280 
ideas as in our previous videos low
pressure<00:01:58.310> medium<00:01:59.310> activity<00:02:00.119> but<00:02:00.570> we'll<00:02:00.930> go

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
pressure medium activity but we'll go

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.370 
pressure medium activity but we'll go
with<00:02:01.320> over<00:02:02.100> 60<00:02:02.610> at<00:02:02.729> team<00:02:03.149> with<00:02:03.450> because<00:02:04.200> we

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
with over 60 at team with because we

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.620 
with over 60 at team with because we
