00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:13.230
 good to all youtube people with something 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.660
 of delay but I bring you the results 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.790
 of nextive-rival the truth that does not 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.400
 I put a lot of eye on this event because I did not 

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:23.130
 I've been very attentive to the ww in the 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.169
 last weeks not only for work but 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.180
 also because he has been somewhat bored 

00:00:25.169 --> 00:00:29.820
 this road to fast line and seriously 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.680
 that has not interested me so much because good 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.810
 the truth that this event I saw in 

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:35.820
 repetition and it was nothing disappointing 

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:38.130
 On the contrary, he entertained me 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.079
 although the only criticism would be some 

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:42.180
 forced rivalry and extruded fights 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:45.420
 practically out of nowhere although despite 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:47.579
 of this they were very beautiful starts the 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.410
 boring pre show and we throw ourselves to the 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.809
 commentators talking and talking and 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:54.239
 returning to speak the truth that is not 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:56.219
 nothing of the other world and as always only 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:58.920
 they are to be stuffed before the event 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:00.899
 it's time for the grabs and we started with 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:04.110
 the video count against the cim cody ross 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:06.540
 vigo against fandango ah do not wait is 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.790
 in the bridge the fight has almost no 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:11.250
 no rivalry or those things but 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.380
 It was very decorous and fun is 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.180
 incredible what counts can perform 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.160
 in this type of events 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.050
 it's a real pity that I lose more 

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:21.510
 of half of his moves when he goes up 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:23.790
 to the main roster for now is a 

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:26.250
 great fight and with the low spear takes 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:28.200
 the triumph before tyler the truth that this 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.330
 combat left me a very good taste of 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.729
 mouth and I wanted to keep watching 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:35.010
 a little more follows the fight between 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:37.470
 embroidered and big show forgive between the 

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:39.479
 fat game and facing aveyron corbÃ­ 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.520
 the truth that this fight was not 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:44.310
 too good with everything and its 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:46.440
 specification of without disqualification to 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.540
 Despite that, it is the weakest 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:50.790
 event and the truth that does not help much 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.890
 that they give if it is not so well-known with that 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:55.470
 I mean it's not popular with the 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:57.690
 fans in general the company the 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:59.399
 fight just raise the corbin bus and the 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:01.590
 true that profile as one of the 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:03.840
 future candidates for the title although 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.790
 needs more reinforcements for this post 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.280
 that has a lot of competition now 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:10.619
 the one that follows is the dragons fight 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.790
 against this is the problem against two 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:14.310
 I do not have the taste 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:16.380
 the titles of couples of in explain 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:18.959
 also in terms of struggles but their 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:20.549
 representatives are low and it's not for 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:21.930
 less after the reign of the 

00:02:20.549 --> 00:02:24.510
 ascent that overshadowed enough 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:26.700
 to each team that was forming the truth 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:29.099
 that the fight is enjoyable entertaining 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:31.980
 beautiful spots of Callisto and defends 

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:34.439
 well as for eye-catching at the end the 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:36.569
 championships change hands and we have to 

00:02:34.439 --> 00:02:38.459
 the new champions that I liked I have 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:40.469
 of knowing them may not follow 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:43.049
 too much yellow mark or not 

00:02:40.469 --> 00:02:45.209
 they are very popular but good hopefully 

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:47.310
 this reign serves to put them in 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:49.769
 the map to talk about them and the 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:52.200
 people turn them to see in the future of 

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:54.269
 while it is ready it is ready to go 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:56.280
 to the main roster and hopefully its 

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:58.560
 character is not a fool and what 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:01.260
 Carguen continues the fight of the painted 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:03.629
 against evan bourne version 2 the truth 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:07.139
 that this fight was very rich many 

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:09.510
 spots and you see moves moved investments 

00:03:07.139 --> 00:03:12.239
 unexpected moments and a lot of love 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:14.310
 both sides this defined the end of the 

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:16.409
 tournament to be a candidate for the championship 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:18.689
 of nextel and the truth that it was nothing 

00:03:16.409 --> 00:03:20.939
 easy to imagine who would win since a 

00:03:18.689 --> 00:03:22.650
 flying like level hardly fits 

00:03:20.939 --> 00:03:24.450
 on the main roster so 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:26.519
 we could think that it would be again 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:28.620
 candidate for the title but will not win it 

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:30.690
 Well, lucini esri choline 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:33.420
 and in the end the painted bay we get with 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:35.370
 the triumph this will be interesting and 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:37.290
 We will see if final value of truth is worth its 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:39.870
 weight in gold because until now it has 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:41.670
 demonstrated the penultimate struggle of the 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:44.159
 night has the title of fighters of 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:46.200
 next and at stake the truth that this 

00:03:44.159 --> 00:03:49.049
 title itself deserves to be fighters and not 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:50.670
 of triple bald divas you can have the 

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:53.310
 nose larger than a stereotype 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:55.170
 argentino you can have a character that 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:57.209
 we can not be courageous 

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:59.340
 spoiled consent of your father-in-law but 

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:02.400
 you have the division of next and on top 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:04.950
 and even more the feminine this fight made me 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:06.989
 the night and is that dance and chat becky 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:08.970
 lounge and sasha bang took the shit out 

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:11.970
 in this fatal fight of four crazy in 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:15.239
 epic disheveled many spots inside 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:18.180
 outside ropes posts sets keys 

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:20.910
 maneuvers finishers and a lot but a lot 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:23.280
 more the truth that this fight was great 

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:24.990
 it reminded us of many old days when 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:27.060
 the category was not barbies that 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:29.639
 they sell tits and asses and instead 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:31.590
 they sold us real fight I think that 

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:33.750
 if the actress rita china 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:35.580
 beth phoenix or natalia saw this fight 

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:38.310
 They are more than satisfied 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:40.500
 they applauded their comrades at the end what 

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:42.750
 inevitable came and sasha bang takes 

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:44.430
 victory in a few months for sure 

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:46.740
 charlotte will be arriving in the area 

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:49.289
 main of the roster and while I 

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:51.870
 celebration because banks is my favorite diva 

00:04:49.289 --> 00:04:53.879
 currently and good to close we have 

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:55.770
 a brock lesnar against jones and nan sommer 

00:04:53.879 --> 00:04:58.379
 slam 2014 

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:59.610
 good a pirate copy of the same kevin 

00:04:58.379 --> 00:05:01.439
 good steen 

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:03.270
 kevin owens for those who did not see ring 

00:05:01.439 --> 00:05:05.520
 of honor, independent struggles 

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:08.310
 facing the generic half in by 

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:10.560
 the yellow title this fight was going to be 

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:12.389
 without the championship in between but that 

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:14.580
 I would have remembered both the roster 

00:05:12.389 --> 00:05:17.099
 main that the creatives decided 

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:19.259
 put the belt in half good 

00:05:17.099 --> 00:05:20.969
 fight starts partner and the truth that I 

00:05:19.259 --> 00:05:22.949
 loved to see that sammy made him good 

00:05:20.969 --> 00:05:24.719
 battle a mole like kevin but 

00:05:22.949 --> 00:05:26.909
 also see owens has a body 

00:05:24.719 --> 00:05:29.370
 big but not for that reason of useless bulk 

00:05:26.909 --> 00:05:31.860
 like others knowing how to make many sets 

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:34.139
 and until he laid a bomb the fight 

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:36.000
 full of expectation to many but in a 

00:05:34.139 --> 00:05:38.520
 movement against the Sami canvas 

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.289
 badly wounded his rhythm of struggle low and owens 

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:41.430
 take advantage to make five bombs 

00:05:40.289 --> 00:05:43.770
 followed 

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:45.780
 after this the referee for the fight and 

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:48.090
 as I had never seen a fight 

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:51.000
 holder won by knockout did not know if 

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:52.950
 blood had one for surprise the referee 

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.890
 raise wen's hand if it gives you the 

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:58.230
 championship without you took a look 

00:05:55.890 --> 00:06:01.050
 bitch this is fast ascend two 

00:05:58.230 --> 00:06:03.600
