everybody the money when I had no say is
very<00:00:30.349> hard<00:00:30.710> for<00:00:31.099> them<00:00:31.640> to<00:00:32.210> pay<00:00:32.540> the<00:00:33.470> planet

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:33.920 
very hard for them to pay the planet

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:38.380 
very hard for them to pay the planet
again<00:00:34.460> which<00:00:34.820> was<00:00:36.010> so<00:00:37.010> during<00:00:37.700> the<00:00:37.820> world<00:00:38.059> they

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:38.390 
again which was so during the world they

bars<00:01:42.319> so<00:01:42.950> many<00:01:43.159> do<00:01:43.280> you<00:01:43.399> got<00:01:43.610> very<00:01:43.819> high

00:01:44.139 --> 00:01:44.149 
bars so many do you got very high

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:46.359 
bars so many do you got very high
temperatures<00:01:44.899> it<00:01:45.530> means<00:01:45.799> that<00:01:46.009> at<00:01:46.189> that<00:01:46.220> time

00:01:46.359 --> 00:01:46.369 
temperatures it means that at that time

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:50.770 
temperatures it means that at that time
the<00:01:47.179> coffee<00:01:47.450> was<00:01:47.659> very<00:01:47.990> dark<00:01:48.819> most<00:01:49.819> burns<00:01:50.360> and

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:50.780 
the coffee was very dark most burns and

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:54.070 
the coffee was very dark most burns and
rocks<00:01:51.369> that<00:01:52.369> look<00:01:52.399> like<00:01:52.819> the<00:01:53.479> coffee<00:01:53.720> of<00:01:53.959> the

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:54.080 
rocks that look like the coffee of the

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:59.289 
rocks that look like the coffee of the
maca<00:01:54.880> no<00:01:55.880> Beast<00:01:56.090> extraction<00:01:57.429> it<00:01:58.429> was<00:01:58.670> because

00:01:59.289 --> 00:01:59.299 
maca no Beast extraction it was because

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:04.089 
maca no Beast extraction it was because
the<00:01:59.420> eating<00:01:59.720> was<00:01:59.899> directing<00:02:00.759> high<00:02:03.099> the

00:02:04.089 --> 00:02:04.099 
the eating was directing high the

00:02:04.099 --> 00:02:06.419 
the eating was directing high the
temperature<00:02:04.310> was<00:02:04.729> very<00:02:04.789> I<00:02:05.030> instead<00:02:05.840> here<00:02:06.110> we

00:02:06.419 --> 00:02:06.429 
temperature was very I instead here we

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:13.720 
temperature was very I instead here we
have<00:02:07.429> a<00:02:08.209> new<00:02:08.869> concept<00:02:09.670> of<00:02:11.680> piston<00:02:12.680> system<00:02:12.980> is

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:13.730 
have a new concept of piston system is

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:17.410 
have a new concept of piston system is
activated<00:02:14.209> by<00:02:14.360> a<00:02:14.510> stream<00:02:14.930> that<00:02:15.340> brings<00:02:16.420> more

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:17.420 
activated by a stream that brings more

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:20.349 
activated by a stream that brings more
pressure<00:02:17.810> usually<00:02:18.590> on<00:02:19.040> the<00:02:19.069> photo<00:02:19.459> future<00:02:20.000> so

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:20.359 
pressure usually on the photo future so

00:02:20.359 --> 00:02:23.050 
pressure usually on the photo future so
on<00:02:20.510> the<00:02:20.660> coffee<00:02:20.900> of<00:02:21.230> the<00:02:21.410> benefits<00:02:21.890> and<00:02:22.280> this

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 
on the coffee of the benefits and this

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:26.110 
on the coffee of the benefits and this
is<00:02:23.209> the<00:02:23.390> time<00:02:23.630> when<00:02:23.900> the<00:02:23.930> creamer<00:02:24.489> appears<00:02:25.489> in

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:26.120 
is the time when the creamer appears in

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:29.349 
is the time when the creamer appears in
the<00:02:26.390> encounter<00:02:27.049> and<00:02:27.290> from<00:02:28.130> now<00:02:28.340> on<00:02:28.370> we<00:02:28.940> can<00:02:29.120> say

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:29.359 
the encounter and from now on we can say

00:02:29.359 --> 00:02:31.780 
the encounter and from now on we can say
that<00:02:29.390> the<00:02:30.079> culture<00:02:30.890> of<00:02:30.920> the<00:02:31.130> coffee<00:02:31.430> of

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790 
that the culture of the coffee of

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:36.460 
that the culture of the coffee of
dispersal<00:02:32.630> changes<00:02:33.290> and<00:02:35.019> now

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:36.470 
dispersal changes and now

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:40.490 
dispersal changes and now
you<00:02:37.470> cannot<00:02:37.860> talk<00:02:38.130> about<00:02:38.730> misplaced<00:02:39.660> or<00:02:39.960> if

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
you cannot talk about misplaced or if

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.590 
you cannot talk about misplaced or if
you<00:02:40.680> don't<00:02:40.890> have<00:02:41.069> the<00:02:41.190> river<00:02:41.490> you<00:02:42.270> cannot

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:42.600 
you don't have the river you cannot

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:46.190 
you don't have the river you cannot
consider<00:02:43.080> this<00:02:43.380> place<00:02:44.959> that's<00:02:45.959> why<00:02:46.140> this

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
consider this place that's why this

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.199 
consider this place that's why this
machine<00:02:46.680> is<00:02:46.770> very<00:02:46.980> important<00:02:47.490> because<00:02:47.640> it

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:48.209 
machine is very important because it

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:57.050 
machine is very important because it
changes<00:02:54.530> after<00:02:55.530> the<00:02:55.740> letter<00:02:56.100> machine<00:02:56.550> now<00:02:56.760> so

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
changes after the letter machine now so

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:00.290 
changes after the letter machine now so
we<00:02:57.209> introduce<00:02:57.690> of<00:02:57.870> course<00:02:58.670> like<00:02:59.670> other<00:02:59.940> of

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:00.300 
we introduce of course like other of

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:02.510 
we introduce of course like other of
makers<00:03:00.870> so<00:03:01.350> confirmations<00:03:01.890> making<00:03:02.280> some

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:02.520 
makers so confirmations making some

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:05.780 
makers so confirmations making some
other<00:03:03.680> standard<00:03:04.680> features<00:03:05.130> which<00:03:05.340> are<00:03:05.520> a

machine is the first machine with the 12

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:50.449 
machine is the first machine with the 12
other<00:03:40.770> technology<00:03:48.020> 6969<00:03:49.020> so<00:03:49.470> until<00:03:49.830> 16<00:03:50.340> I'll

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:50.459 
other technology 6969 so until 16 I'll

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:53.089 
other technology 6969 so until 16 I'll
of<00:03:50.670> otago<00:03:51.150> has<00:03:51.360> one<00:03:51.630> boiler<00:03:51.870> like<00:03:52.560> everybody

00:03:53.089 --> 00:03:53.099 
of otago has one boiler like everybody

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:56.870 
of otago has one boiler like everybody
so<00:03:53.760> and<00:03:54.060> in<00:03:54.480> the<00:03:54.599> six<00:03:54.810> days<00:03:55.080> or<00:03:55.980> less<00:03:56.220> all<00:03:56.610> the

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:56.880 
so and in the six days or less all the

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:59.870 
so and in the six days or less all the
machine<00:03:57.239> yes<00:03:57.720> same<00:03:58.080> characteristics<00:03:58.730> so<00:03:59.730> they

00:03:59.870 --> 00:03:59.880 
machine yes same characteristics so they

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:02.390 
machine yes same characteristics so they
are<00:04:00.060> seing<00:04:00.300> pressure<00:04:01.140> because<00:04:01.650> they<00:04:01.830> all<00:04:02.160> use

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.400 
are seing pressure because they all use

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:06.380 
are seing pressure because they all use
the<00:04:03.030> tamper<00:04:03.959> the<00:04:04.500> rotary<00:04:04.860> pump<00:04:05.280> so<00:04:06.030> they<00:04:06.180> have

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:06.390 
the tamper the rotary pump so they have

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:08.630 
the tamper the rotary pump so they have
the<00:04:06.510> mechanical<00:04:07.230> and<00:04:07.470> the<00:04:07.500> automatic<00:04:08.069> system

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:08.640 
the mechanical and the automatic system

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:12.009 
the mechanical and the automatic system
they<00:04:09.239> are<00:04:09.330> horizontal<00:04:10.170> and<00:04:10.620> with<00:04:10.890> one<00:04:11.160> toilet

00:04:12.009 --> 00:04:12.019 
they are horizontal and with one toilet

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:27.140 
they are horizontal and with one toilet
exactly<00:04:13.130> and<00:04:17.150> so<00:04:22.700> now<00:04:24.410> at<00:04:25.410> this<00:04:25.470> stage<00:04:26.190> at

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:27.150 
exactly and so now at this stage at

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:29.450 
exactly and so now at this stage at
least<00:04:27.389> happen<00:04:28.020> for<00:04:28.320> the<00:04:28.440> coffee<00:04:28.650> industry<00:04:28.919> the

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:29.460 
least happen for the coffee industry the

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:33.110 
least happen for the coffee industry the

was<00:04:50.099> the<00:04:50.460> stability<00:04:51.090> of<00:04:51.270> the<00:04:51.539> channels

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:52.020 
was the stability of the channels

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:53.510 
was the stability of the channels
working<00:04:52.410> so<00:04:52.650> which<00:04:52.830> other<00:04:53.039> was<00:04:53.310> very

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:53.520 
working so which other was very

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:56.860 
working so which other was very
important<00:04:54.949> which<00:04:55.949> is<00:04:56.099> one<00:04:56.400> of<00:04:56.430> the<00:04:56.580> main

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:56.870 
important which is one of the main

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:59.870 
important which is one of the main
sector<00:04:57.870> to<00:04:58.349> get<00:04:58.530> the<00:04:58.680> good<00:04:58.830> coffee<00:04:59.099> and<00:04:59.460> this
