00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:27.350 
sniffle to make it stiffer but it's just

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:35.240 
don't wrestle up yeah really slow

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:37.780 
don't wrestle up yeah really slow
because<00:01:35.870> it<00:01:36.170> does<00:01:36.410> splash<00:01:36.890> out<00:01:37.160> to<00:01:37.460> begin<00:01:37.640> with

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:37.790 
because it does splash out to begin with

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:40.120 
because it does splash out to begin with
late<00:01:38.270> so<00:01:38.570> we<00:01:38.690> start<00:01:38.990> off<00:01:39.260> slow<00:01:39.620> till<00:01:39.950> it's

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:40.130 
late so we start off slow till it's

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:42.880 
late so we start off slow till it's
mixed<00:01:40.550> a<00:01:40.640> bit<00:01:40.850> and<00:01:41.240> then<00:01:41.450> I'll<00:01:41.600> turn<00:01:41.840> it<00:01:42.020> up<00:01:42.170> so

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:42.890

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:44.390 
if you turn it on straightaway in turn

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:46.780 
if you turn it on straightaway in turn
on<00:01:44.570> too<00:01:44.780> far<00:01:45.110> it<00:01:45.619> will<00:01:45.740> just<00:01:45.920> pop<00:01:46.250> out<00:01:46.490> on<00:01:46.670> the

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:46.790 
on too far it will just pop out on the

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:49.359 
on too far it will just pop out on the
sides<00:01:47.060> low<00:01:47.450> and<00:01:47.750> now<00:01:47.869> you<00:01:47.930> see<00:01:48.170> it's<00:01:48.350> fine<00:01:48.590> so<00:01:49.340> I
