00:00:01.379 --> 00:00:05.330
 Although paco tez more difficult to use and handle there are a number of aspects 

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:08.330
 important that the user should know and fulfill 

00:00:10.319 --> 00:00:13.999
 wash aberration is only illuminated with a blade come into contact with 

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:17.009
 the frozen surface contents of the container 

00:00:17.009 --> 00:00:19.539
 this division performances begin this point 

00:00:19.539 --> 00:00:22.539
 even in the case of partially filled glasses 

00:00:23.079 --> 00:00:26.899
 messi in a state of grace ignites us, it is probably because the 

00:00:26.899 --> 00:00:30.839
 content of the container is too soft uu that was used too 

00:00:30.839 --> 00:00:35.160
 sugar the recipe before so quoted a frozen container 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.170
 always make sure that the surface of the content is uniform 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:42.630
 otherwise the blade could be damaged 

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:46.060
 that's why it always charges the upper part of the container with a liquid at 

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:48.380
 prepare them to freeze 

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:52.170
 so that the solid elements do not protrude the blade together with the 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.670
 protective antisa bites in the container 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:55.960
 as if it were a lid 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:00.120
 in its place only that always protective against splashes in the magnetic piece 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.520
 of the handle that protrudes from under the machine 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:06.840
 there must be a click that confirms that it has been firmly placed in its 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:07.680
 place 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.860
 both the blade and the magnet can be damaged if this is not done 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.780
 correctly keep in mind that they press the red button this can be stopped 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.800
 immediately and at any time 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:20.060
 a processing cycle 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:23.990
 when you press after this new the machine will return to the initial position 

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:29.050
 avoid overfilling the containers at maximum fill level 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:32.410
 should leave free around an inch and a half or four centimeters 

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:36.450
 from the edge to allow expansion this measure is especially 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.690
 important in these with a high content in eighth sugar in this case 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:43.940
 which containers will expand the most should be placed on a 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:48.290
 flat surface in the freezer do not freeze the inclined vessels before 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:52.670
 Freeze the same on the surface to eliminate any mound hole 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:56.360
 similar to a crater remember to fly especially before freezing a 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:58.260
 partially used container 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:03.080
 the opposite the blade could bend or even break the blade 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:06.560
 sieve can be bent when breaking contents of the glass are not frozen 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:10.440
 uniformly asked often to have left us in the freezer during 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.869
 24 hours 

00:02:12.869 --> 00:02:16.769
 if freezing containers are exposed to temperatures too low 

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:20.449
 the final product will have a students dust similar to snow in 

00:02:20.449 --> 00:02:21.599
 place of creamy 

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:24.599
 this can also happen with low fiber fruits 

00:02:25.189 --> 00:02:29.790
 with a relatively high water content popÃ³catl destination to your home as 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:32.839
 for example, strawberries and citrus fruits 

00:02:32.839 --> 00:02:36.249
 the solution is to pour a bit of pawn on the surface 

00:02:36.799 --> 00:02:40.109
 and process everything a second time 

00:02:40.109 --> 00:02:43.019
 in the same way you know quoted containers is not enough 

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:47.739
 frozen the resulting texture will be rough and grainy 

00:02:49.039 --> 00:02:53.039
 speaking and clarifying and this work always in a steel container and never 

00:02:53.039 --> 00:02:56.039
 directly in the black plastic container 

00:02:56.629 --> 00:03:00.379
 otherwise the machine could stop, leaving the shaft inside the 

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:01.529
 container
