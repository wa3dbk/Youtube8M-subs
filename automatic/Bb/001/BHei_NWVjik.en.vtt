here<00:04:07.560> that<00:04:08.280> that<00:04:08.790> little<00:04:09.060> Duke<00:04:09.209> right<00:04:09.390> there

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:09.540 
here that that little Duke right there

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:12.680 
here that that little Duke right there
that<00:04:09.720> was<00:04:09.810> really<00:04:10.740> nice<00:04:10.920> that<00:04:11.390> was<00:04:12.390> a<00:04:12.450> really

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:15.570 
nice Juke Pat myself on the back here

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:19.190 
nice Juke Pat myself on the back here
but<00:04:16.170> I<00:04:17.359> don't<00:04:18.359> know<00:04:18.480> just<00:04:18.720> something<00:04:18.959> about

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:19.200 
but I don't know just something about

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:21.920 
but I don't know just something about
that<00:04:19.410> yeah<00:04:19.620> that<00:04:19.799> was<00:04:19.920> a<00:04:19.950> rittle<00:04:20.640> just<00:04:20.930> look

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:21.930 
that yeah that was a rittle just look

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:28.010 
that yeah that was a rittle just look
really<00:04:23.180> really<00:04:24.180> realistic<00:04:26.120> the<00:04:27.120> animations

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:28.020 
really really realistic the animations

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:31.370 
really really realistic the animations
can<00:04:28.290> do<00:04:28.440> a<00:04:28.470> lot<00:04:29.450> it<00:04:30.450> doesn't<00:04:30.870> have<00:04:31.080> to<00:04:31.260> be

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:31.380 
can do a lot it doesn't have to be

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:33.710 
can do a lot it doesn't have to be
physics<00:04:31.800> and<00:04:31.980> 2k<00:04:32.250> is<00:04:32.280> proved<00:04:32.640> that<00:04:32.820> animations

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:33.720 
physics and 2k is proved that animations

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:36.050 
physics and 2k is proved that animations
can<00:04:33.930> do<00:04:34.169> a<00:04:34.500> lot<00:04:35.040> and<00:04:35.340> they<00:04:35.490> could<00:04:35.640> drop<00:04:35.790> it<00:04:35.970> a

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:36.060 
can do a lot and they could drop it a

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:37.370 
can do a lot and they could drop it a
game<00:04:36.750> home

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:37.380 
game home

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:39.290

speaking<00:04:37.919> of<00:04:38.010> some<00:04:38.160> animations<00:04:38.669> I'm<00:04:38.820> just<00:04:39.150> so

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:39.300 
speaking of some animations I'm just so

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:43.220 
speaking of some animations I'm just so
showcasing<00:04:40.169> catching<00:04:40.500> animations<00:04:40.950> here<00:04:42.230> that

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:43.230 
showcasing catching animations here that

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:44.659 
showcasing catching animations here that
I<00:04:43.260> have<00:04:43.470> yet<00:04:43.650> to<00:04:43.710> see<00:04:43.950> anything<00:04:44.220> close<00:04:44.400> to<00:04:44.460> this

00:04:44.659 --> 00:04:44.669 
I have yet to see anything close to this

00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:47.000 
I have yet to see anything close to this
and<00:04:44.820> that<00:04:45.230> he<00:04:46.230> said<00:04:46.380> that<00:04:46.500> one<00:04:46.620> add<00:04:46.740> it<00:04:46.860> goes

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:47.010 
and that he said that one add it goes

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:49.790 
and that he said that one add it goes
there<00:04:47.450> then<00:04:48.450> followed<00:04:48.870> by<00:04:49.169> this<00:04:49.230> catch<00:04:49.560> right

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:49.800 
there then followed by this catch right
