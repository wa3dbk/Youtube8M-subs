and there's an air pink visor daunting I

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:26.990 
and there's an air pink visor daunting I
can't<00:06:23.760> say<00:06:24.000> that<00:06:24.920> well<00:06:25.920> obviously<00:06:26.190> as<00:06:26.640> shown

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:27.000 
can't say that well obviously as shown

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:28.790 
can't say that well obviously as shown
right<00:06:27.030> here<00:06:27.330> is<00:06:27.420> that<00:06:27.600> when<00:06:28.530> there's<00:06:28.740> a

00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:28.800 
right here is that when there's a

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:31.010 
right here is that when there's a
airplane<00:06:29.610> or<00:06:29.820> something<00:06:30.210> passing<00:06:30.600> by<00:06:30.720> it

00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:31.020 
airplane or something passing by it

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:34.040 
airplane or something passing by it
tends<00:06:31.230> to<00:06:31.320> mess<00:06:31.680> with<00:06:31.830> the<00:06:31.950> signal<00:06:32.340> as<00:06:33.050> with

tends to mess with the signal as with
anything<00:06:34.680> but<00:06:35.060> that's<00:06:36.060> pretty<00:06:36.390> much<00:06:36.540> the<00:06:36.720> only

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:36.750 
anything but that's pretty much the only

00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:40.250 
anything but that's pretty much the only
downside<00:06:37.730> but<00:06:38.730> besides<00:06:39.330> that<00:06:39.570> everything

00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:40.260 
downside but besides that everything
