00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
with dwarfs due to their similar size

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.889 
with dwarfs due to their similar size
but<00:01:53.189> they<00:01:53.340> are<00:01:53.369> actually<00:01:54.000> totally<00:01:54.420> different

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
but they are actually totally different

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:57.380 
but they are actually totally different
because<00:01:55.110> their<00:01:55.530> genus<00:01:55.950> means<00:01:56.390> long-tailed

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
because their genus means long-tailed

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.289

whites and campbell's to be pure but
they<00:04:00.480> are<00:04:00.660> not<00:04:00.959> they<00:04:01.319> are<00:04:01.530> usually<00:04:01.709> mixes<00:04:02.400> of

they are not they are usually mixes of
each<00:04:03.569> other's<00:04:03.989> characteristics<00:04:04.919> but<00:04:05.699> how<00:04:06.030> do

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:06.090 
each other's characteristics but how do

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:08.360 
each other's characteristics but how do
you<00:04:06.180> tell<00:04:06.480> which<00:04:06.780> one<00:04:07.019> is<00:04:07.199> which<00:04:07.230> here's<00:04:08.190> a

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:08.370 
you tell which one is which here's a

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:10.430 
you tell which one is which here's a
picture<00:04:08.609> of<00:04:08.760> a<00:04:09.209> Kimball's<00:04:09.750> and<00:04:09.959> winter<00:04:10.260> white

so<00:04:11.099> on<00:04:11.250> the<00:04:11.400> left<00:04:11.579> there<00:04:12.000> is<00:04:12.030> a<00:04:12.269> Campbell's

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:12.900 
so on the left there is a Campbell's

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:15.199 
so on the left there is a Campbell's
Campbell's<00:04:13.680> usually<00:04:14.069> have<00:04:14.220> longer<00:04:14.699> pointy

Campbell's usually have longer pointy

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:15.770 
Campbell's usually have longer pointy
noses

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:15.780

reference to show you just the
differences<00:04:31.389> between<00:04:31.600> each<00:04:31.840> species<00:04:32.470> and

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:32.740 
differences between each species and

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:35.129
