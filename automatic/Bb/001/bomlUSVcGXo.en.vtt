00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:09.570
 Today we are going to teach you how to make a center 

00:00:06.479 --> 00:00:12.330
 of winter focused on this Christmas alone 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:16.470
 We are going to need a tray style 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:21.380
 silver like this candles we bought from 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.380
 different heights and colors pineapples 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.100
 and typical winter Christmas ornaments 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.920
 that you can find in any 

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:31.220
 establishment 

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:32.930
 and a few red rose petals 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:35.780
 dark pulling to burgundy because it 's all 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:38.860
 as very winter is very simple in the 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:38.860
 tray we are going to place 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.949
 this other figure that we have not taught 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.350
 how do you see imitates like an ashtray 

00:00:43.949 --> 00:00:48.329
 old silver and we're going to turn it around 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:52.609
 because because we are going to do different 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:52.609
 heights worth 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.590
 the rose petals are going to be placed 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.930
 around because we do not want it to look 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:02.920
 what is another figure turns around and does not 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:02.920
 will notice you will see 

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:08.329
 these centerpieces are ideal for 

00:01:06.319 --> 00:01:10.520
 all winter are timeless but it's 

00:01:08.329 --> 00:01:13.880
 true that at Christmas we always want 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:16.340
 decorate a little bit more our 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:18.770
 after furniture and our tables we place 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:22.180
 the pineapples 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:22.180
 in a very casual way 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:39.120
 now let's place the candles 

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:47.450
 and we are going to distribute a little discounted the 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.450
 so you can not see the other height 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.900
 the idea is that everything remains as very 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.900
 spontaneous 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:00.710
 finally let's put these twigs 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:04.229
 that we have bought because they are bright 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:06.619
 and evoke the Christmas dates that 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:06.619
 we want 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:16.249
 and so we have our centerpiece 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:18.650
 Christmas we can vary and change 

00:02:16.249 --> 00:02:20.689
 when we get bored of him if you want 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:22.639
