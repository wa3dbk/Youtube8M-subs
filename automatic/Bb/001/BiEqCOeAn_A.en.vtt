00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
them on purpose and that's the right way

to<00:01:02.010> do<00:01:02.190> things<00:01:02.219> he<00:01:02.699> was<00:01:02.820> just<00:01:02.969> talking<00:01:03.090> about

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
to do things he was just talking about

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.359 
to do things he was just talking about
the<00:01:03.840> way<00:01:03.930> that<00:01:04.049> he<00:01:04.199> does<00:01:04.260> things<00:01:04.619> and<00:01:05.010> I<00:01:05.189> just

the way that he does things and I just

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:06.649 
the way that he does things and I just
thought<00:01:05.489> I'd<00:01:05.610> talk<00:01:05.729> briefly<00:01:05.970> about<00:01:06.150> what<00:01:06.510> I<00:01:06.540> do

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
thought I'd talk briefly about what I do

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.590 
thought I'd talk briefly about what I do
whenever<00:01:07.500> I<00:01:07.680> prestige<00:01:08.490> what<00:01:08.820> I<00:01:08.850> like<00:01:09.119> to<00:01:09.240> do<00:01:09.390> is

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
whenever I prestige what I like to do is

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.450 
whenever I prestige what I like to do is
and<00:01:10.290> I<00:01:10.320> was<00:01:10.500> gonna<00:01:10.590> make<00:01:10.770> a<00:01:10.799> guide<00:01:11.040> out<00:01:11.070> of<00:01:11.340> this

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
and I was gonna make a guide out of this

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.190 
and I was gonna make a guide out of this
but<00:01:11.700> now<00:01:11.880> I<00:01:11.909> kind<00:01:12.360> of<00:01:12.420> look<00:01:12.570> back<00:01:12.600> on<00:01:12.960> it<00:01:13.080> in

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
but now I kind of look back on it in

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.840 
but now I kind of look back on it in
retrospect<00:01:13.500> and<00:01:13.920> it<00:01:14.100> kind<00:01:14.250> of<00:01:14.280> seems<00:01:14.460> dumb<00:01:14.670> to

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
retrospect and it kind of seems dumb to

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.789 
retrospect and it kind of seems dumb to
make<00:01:14.939> a<00:01:14.970> guide<00:01:15.240> about<00:01:15.479> how<00:01:15.600> to<00:01:15.689> prestige<00:01:16.080> but

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
make a guide about how to prestige but

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:17.990 
make a guide about how to prestige but
the<00:01:16.950> way<00:01:17.040> that<00:01:17.220> I<00:01:17.250> found<00:01:17.549> the<00:01:17.759> most<00:01:17.880> success

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
the way that I found the most success

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.120

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:49.020 
success with is the gunship and unlike

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:50.870 
success with is the gunship and unlike
in<00:02:49.170> previous<00:02:49.500> games<00:02:49.680> where<00:02:50.010> people<00:02:50.670> are<00:02:50.760> just

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:50.880 
in previous games where people are just

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:52.670 
in previous games where people are just
like<00:02:51.030> oh<00:02:51.210> well<00:02:51.450> I<00:02:51.510> do<00:02:51.600> better<00:02:51.870> with<00:02:52.080> this<00:02:52.350> and<00:02:52.620> I

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
like oh well I do better with this and I

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:54.530 
like oh well I do better with this and I
do<00:02:52.740> better<00:02:52.950> with<00:02:53.160> that<00:02:53.190> in<00:02:54.000> this<00:02:54.180> game<00:02:54.360> it

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
do better with that in this game it

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.330 
do better with that in this game it
actually<00:02:54.840> shows<00:02:55.140> you<00:02:55.320> you<00:02:55.530> know<00:02:55.620> what<00:02:56.070> you<00:02:56.190> do

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
actually shows you you know what you do

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:57.680 
actually shows you you know what you do
better<00:02:56.550> with<00:02:56.760> and<00:02:56.940> what<00:02:57.030> you<00:02:57.120> average<00:02:57.480> more

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 
better with and what you average more

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:00.560 
better with and what you average more
kills<00:02:57.930> with<00:02:58.140> and<00:02:58.410> in<00:02:58.680> order<00:02:59.010> of<00:02:59.270> most<00:03:00.270> kills

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:00.570 
kills with and in order of most kills

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:02.540 
kills with and in order of most kills
the<00:03:00.750> least<00:03:00.930> kills<00:03:01.170> for<00:03:01.650> me<00:03:01.770> at<00:03:02.040> least<00:03:02.280> it's

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:02.550 
the least kills for me at least it's

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:04.970 
the least kills for me at least it's
chopper<00:03:03.000> gunner<00:03:03.210> gunship<00:03:04.200> and<00:03:04.380> then<00:03:04.620> attack

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
chopper gunner gunship and then attack

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:06.710 
chopper gunner gunship and then attack
dogs<00:03:05.250> now<00:03:05.520> I<00:03:05.550> don't<00:03:05.790> use<00:03:05.880> the<00:03:06.000> attack<00:03:06.240> dogs<00:03:06.450> too

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
dogs now I don't use the attack dogs too

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:09.110 
dogs now I don't use the attack dogs too
much<00:03:06.900> so<00:03:07.410> those<00:03:07.590> statistics<00:03:08.130> are<00:03:08.340> not<00:03:08.820> nearly

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
much so those statistics are not nearly

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.540 
much so those statistics are not nearly
as<00:03:09.300> accurate<00:03:09.570> or<00:03:09.990> aren't<00:03:10.680> very<00:03:10.950> accurate<00:03:11.430> but

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:11.550 
as accurate or aren't very accurate but

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:13.400 
as accurate or aren't very accurate but
I've<00:03:11.670> gotten<00:03:12.000> you<00:03:12.120> know<00:03:12.150> 10<00:03:12.810> or<00:03:12.930> 20<00:03:13.170> attack

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:13.410 
I've gotten you know 10 or 20 attack

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:15.680 
I've gotten you know 10 or 20 attack
dogs<00:03:13.680> I<00:03:13.860> think<00:03:13.890> or<00:03:14.340> maybe<00:03:14.880> not<00:03:15.150> quite<00:03:15.330> that<00:03:15.660> I

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:15.690 
dogs I think or maybe not quite that I

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:17.630 
dogs I think or maybe not quite that I
don't<00:03:16.020> really<00:03:16.140> use<00:03:16.410> them<00:03:16.590> much<00:03:17.190> at<00:03:17.370> all<00:03:17.430> I

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:17.640 
don't really use them much at all I

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:18.920 
don't really use them much at all I
don't<00:03:17.940> even<00:03:18.030> think<00:03:18.150> I've<00:03:18.360> unlocked<00:03:18.480> them<00:03:18.840> in

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930 
don't even think I've unlocked them in

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:22.280 
don't even think I've unlocked them in
this<00:03:19.020> prestige<00:03:19.520> but<00:03:20.520> yeah<00:03:21.150> so<00:03:21.420> I<00:03:21.450> definitely

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
this prestige but yeah so I definitely

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:23.990 
this prestige but yeah so I definitely
do<00:03:22.470> average<00:03:22.980> more<00:03:23.190> kills<00:03:23.400> with<00:03:23.520> my<00:03:23.610> chopper

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
do average more kills with my chopper

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.970 
do average more kills with my chopper
than<00:03:24.209> my<00:03:24.300> gunship<00:03:24.630> and<00:03:24.870> more<00:03:25.230> kills<00:03:25.440> with<00:03:25.709> my

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:25.980 
than my gunship and more kills with my

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:28.490 
than my gunship and more kills with my
gunship<00:03:26.910> and<00:03:27.180> chopper<00:03:27.570> than<00:03:27.780> my<00:03:27.989> attack<00:03:28.230> dogs

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
gunship and chopper than my attack dogs

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.920 
gunship and chopper than my attack dogs
and<00:03:28.800> I<00:03:29.670> just<00:03:30.120> don't<00:03:30.330> think<00:03:30.480> that<00:03:30.600> the<00:03:30.690> attack

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930 
and I just don't think that the attack

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:32.949 
and I just don't think that the attack
dogs<00:03:31.170> are<00:03:31.410> very<00:03:31.620> worthwhile<00:03:31.950> kill<00:03:32.489> streak<00:03:32.730> so

00:03:32.949 --> 00:03:32.959 
dogs are very worthwhile kill streak so

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:35.570 
dogs are very worthwhile kill streak so
for<00:03:33.959> people<00:03:34.320> out<00:03:34.560> there<00:03:34.770> who<00:03:34.980> are<00:03:35.190> choosing

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:35.580 
for people out there who are choosing

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:36.860 
for people out there who are choosing
between<00:03:35.640> high<00:03:35.940> kill<00:03:36.180> streaks<00:03:36.420> and<00:03:36.600> want<00:03:36.810> to

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870 
between high kill streaks and want to

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:38.090 
between high kill streaks and want to
know<00:03:37.020> a<00:03:37.050> little<00:03:37.320> bit<00:03:37.440> about<00:03:37.620> the<00:03:37.739> high<00:03:37.860> kill

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:38.100 
know a little bit about the high kill

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:40.490 
know a little bit about the high kill
streaks<00:03:38.370> I<00:03:38.550> would<00:03:39.150> definitely<00:03:39.660> say<00:03:39.900> that<00:03:40.140> if

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:40.500 
streaks I would definitely say that if

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:42.350 
streaks I would definitely say that if
you<00:03:40.950> know<00:03:41.070> you<00:03:41.130> you<00:03:41.670> are<00:03:41.700> going<00:03:42.120> with

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:42.360 
you know you you are going with

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:43.520 
you know you you are going with
something<00:03:42.570> like<00:03:42.810> maybe<00:03:42.959> like<00:03:43.170> a<00:03:43.230> spy<00:03:43.470> plane

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:43.530 
something like maybe like a spy plane

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:45.229 
something like maybe like a spy plane
and<00:03:43.980> a<00:03:44.010> blackbird<00:03:44.459> and<00:03:44.640> then<00:03:45.030> you're<00:03:45.150> looking

00:03:45.229 --> 00:03:45.239 
and a blackbird and then you're looking

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:46.790 
and a blackbird and then you're looking
for<00:03:45.540> that<00:03:45.630> you<00:03:45.900> know<00:03:46.020> third<00:03:46.290> kill<00:03:46.500> shake<00:03:46.709> to

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:46.800 
for that you know third kill shake to

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:48.560 
for that you know third kill shake to
put<00:03:46.980> on<00:03:47.100> don't<00:03:47.610> go<00:03:47.730> with<00:03:47.850> the<00:03:47.940> gunship<00:03:48.300> don't

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:48.570 
put on don't go with the gunship don't

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:50.000 
put on don't go with the gunship don't
go<00:03:48.630> with<00:03:48.750> the<00:03:48.840> attack<00:03:49.110> dogs<00:03:49.410> go<00:03:49.739> with<00:03:49.860> the

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.010 
go with the attack dogs go with the

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:52.190 
go with the attack dogs go with the
chopper<00:03:50.459> gunner<00:03:50.640> it<00:03:50.790> typically<00:03:51.270> will<00:03:51.840> get<00:03:52.020> you

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:52.200 
chopper gunner it typically will get you

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:54.080 
chopper gunner it typically will get you
more<00:03:52.440> kills<00:03:52.709> than<00:03:52.950> the<00:03:53.070> other<00:03:53.220> kill<00:03:53.850> streaks

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.090 
more kills than the other kill streaks

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:56.390 
more kills than the other kill streaks
now<00:03:54.209> obviously<00:03:54.630> I'm<00:03:55.050> sure<00:03:55.410> I'm<00:03:55.530> gonna<00:03:55.620> have<00:03:55.739> 50

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:56.400 
now obviously I'm sure I'm gonna have 50

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:57.860 
now obviously I'm sure I'm gonna have 50
people<00:03:56.580> tell<00:03:56.910> me<00:03:56.940> that<00:03:57.209> I'm<00:03:57.360> just<00:03:57.390> terrible

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:57.870 
people tell me that I'm just terrible

00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:59.449 
people tell me that I'm just terrible
with<00:03:57.930> the<00:03:58.230> chopper<00:03:58.770> gunner<00:03:58.950> and<00:03:59.100> the<00:03:59.160> attack

00:03:59.449 --> 00:03:59.459 
with the chopper gunner and the attack

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:01.370 
with the chopper gunner and the attack

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:04.790 
or that I just have bad luck and then
you<00:04:03.390> know<00:04:03.570> the<00:04:03.690> attack<00:04:03.930> dogs<00:04:04.140> are<00:04:04.290> awesome<00:04:04.440> and

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:04.800

to those people I say if it works for

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:08.060 
to those people I say if it works for
you<00:04:06.989> that<00:04:07.290> is<00:04:07.440> awesome

you that is awesome

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:10.250

more power to you I just don't find

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.140 
more power to you I just don't find
nearly<00:04:11.040> as<00:04:11.220> much<00:04:11.340> success<00:04:11.550> with<00:04:11.850> those<00:04:11.940> two

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:12.150 
nearly as much success with those two

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:13.520 
nearly as much success with those two
kill<00:04:12.360> streaks<00:04:12.600> as<00:04:12.750> I<00:04:12.900> do<00:04:12.959> with<00:04:13.140> the<00:04:13.200> chopper

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:13.530 
kill streaks as I do with the chopper

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:16.190 
kill streaks as I do with the chopper
gunner<00:04:13.680> so<00:04:14.130> I<00:04:14.820> guess<00:04:15.660> it's<00:04:15.840> not<00:04:15.930> really

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:16.200 
gunner so I guess it's not really

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:18.170 
gunner so I guess it's not really
necessarily<00:04:16.650> a<00:04:16.769> preference<00:04:17.190> thing<00:04:17.370> but<00:04:18.060> more

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:18.180 
necessarily a preference thing but more

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:20.270 
necessarily a preference thing but more
or<00:04:18.299> less<00:04:18.359> a<00:04:18.720> you<00:04:19.290> know<00:04:19.410> how<00:04:19.590> well<00:04:19.799> do<00:04:19.950> I<00:04:20.040> do<00:04:20.100> with

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:20.280 
or less a you know how well do I do with

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:22.159 
or less a you know how well do I do with
it<00:04:20.340> thing<00:04:20.640> according<00:04:21.150> to<00:04:21.359> the<00:04:21.510> statistics<00:04:22.080> of

00:04:22.159 --> 00:04:22.169 
it thing according to the statistics of

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:24.740 
it thing according to the statistics of
the<00:04:22.260> game<00:04:22.440> so<00:04:22.740> that's<00:04:23.610> just<00:04:23.940> me<00:04:24.120> and<00:04:24.390> if<00:04:24.630> it's

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:24.750 
the game so that's just me and if it's

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:26.150 
the game so that's just me and if it's
different<00:04:24.990> I'm<00:04:25.440> assuming<00:04:25.800> that<00:04:25.830> it's<00:04:26.070> the

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:26.160 
different I'm assuming that it's the

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:27.590 
different I'm assuming that it's the
same<00:04:26.340> for<00:04:26.520> most<00:04:26.610> people<00:04:26.970> but<00:04:27.180> if<00:04:27.300> it's

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:27.600 
same for most people but if it's

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.360 
same for most people but if it's
for<00:04:27.810> you<00:04:27.900> then<00:04:28.230> by<00:04:28.680> all<00:04:28.830> means<00:04:29.040> go<00:04:29.250> with

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:29.370 
for you then by all means go with

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:31.340 
for you then by all means go with
whatever<00:04:29.520> you<00:04:29.730> like<00:04:29.840> so<00:04:30.840> this<00:04:31.020> game<00:04:31.170> I<00:04:31.230> was

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:31.350 
whatever you like so this game I was

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:32.600 
whatever you like so this game I was
playing<00:04:31.380> pretty<00:04:31.770> I<00:04:32.130> guess<00:04:32.340> you<00:04:32.460> could<00:04:32.580> say

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:32.610 
playing pretty I guess you could say

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:35.060 
playing pretty I guess you could say
hardcore<00:04:33.150> objective<00:04:33.660> I<00:04:33.810> was<00:04:34.050> pretty<00:04:34.830> much<00:04:34.890> the

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:35.070 
hardcore objective I was pretty much the

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:36.830 
hardcore objective I was pretty much the
only<00:04:35.130> guy<00:04:35.370> on<00:04:35.400> my<00:04:35.580> team<00:04:35.610> defusing<00:04:36.330> bombs<00:04:36.360> I<00:04:36.720> was

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:36.840 
only guy on my team defusing bombs I was

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:38.870 
only guy on my team defusing bombs I was
running<00:04:37.080> back<00:04:37.260> and<00:04:37.470> forth<00:04:37.560> and<00:04:38.010> it<00:04:38.370> was<00:04:38.490> really

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:38.880 
running back and forth and it was really

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:40.340 
running back and forth and it was really
frustrating<00:04:39.120> me<00:04:39.540> actually<00:04:39.930> because<00:04:40.200> what

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:40.350 
frustrating me actually because what

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:42.040 
frustrating me actually because what
would<00:04:40.470> happen<00:04:40.500> was<00:04:40.980> in<00:04:41.370> this<00:04:41.550> game<00:04:41.790> I<00:04:41.970> remember

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:42.050 
would happen was in this game I remember

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:45.530 
would happen was in this game I remember
I<00:04:43.050> would<00:04:44.030> defuse<00:04:45.030> a<00:04:45.060> bomb<00:04:45.210> or<00:04:45.450> I'd<00:04:45.510> be

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:45.540 
I would defuse a bomb or I'd be

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:47.870 
I would defuse a bomb or I'd be
defending<00:04:46.200> one<00:04:46.380> area<00:04:46.680> and<00:04:46.860> it<00:04:47.280> seemed<00:04:47.460> like<00:04:47.730> my

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:47.880 
defending one area and it seemed like my

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:49.460 
defending one area and it seemed like my
entire<00:04:48.150> team<00:04:48.450> is<00:04:48.600> at<00:04:48.720> that<00:04:48.840> same<00:04:49.050> area<00:04:49.320> and

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:49.470 
entire team is at that same area and

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:51.500 
entire team is at that same area and
then<00:04:49.590> what<00:04:49.710> would<00:04:49.830> happen<00:04:49.980> is<00:04:50.420> with<00:04:51.420> the

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:51.510 
then what would happen is with the

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:53.300 
then what would happen is with the
exception<00:04:51.780> excuse<00:04:52.290> me<00:04:52.440> with<00:04:52.800> the<00:04:52.920> exception

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:53.310 
exception excuse me with the exception

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:54.740 
exception excuse me with the exception
of<00:04:53.370> this<00:04:53.490> one<00:04:53.760> time<00:04:54.000> right<00:04:54.240> here<00:04:54.450> that's

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:54.750 
of this one time right here that's

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:56.090 
of this one time right here that's
happening<00:04:55.140> right<00:04:55.170> now<00:04:55.320> where<00:04:55.710> I<00:04:55.740> get<00:04:55.980> these

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:56.100 
happening right now where I get these

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:58.960 
happening right now where I get these
three<00:04:56.370> guys<00:04:56.660> and<00:04:57.660> defuse<00:04:58.260> the<00:04:58.380> bomb<00:04:58.530> I<00:04:58.680> think

00:04:58.960 --> 00:04:58.970 
three guys and defuse the bomb I think

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:01.520 
three guys and defuse the bomb I think
the<00:04:59.970> other<00:05:00.210> times<00:05:00.540> what<00:05:00.810> would<00:05:00.960> happen<00:05:01.260> is

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:01.530 
the other times what would happen is

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:03.470 
the other times what would happen is
they<00:05:01.950> would<00:05:01.980> plant<00:05:02.340> the<00:05:02.460> bomb<00:05:02.610> and<00:05:02.790> then<00:05:03.300> the

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:03.480 
they would plant the bomb and then the

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:05.480 
they would plant the bomb and then the
entire<00:05:03.840> team<00:05:04.200> would<00:05:04.440> shift<00:05:04.770> side<00:05:05.040> of<00:05:05.190> the<00:05:05.250> map

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:05.490 
entire team would shift side of the map

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:07.310 
entire team would shift side of the map
and<00:05:05.700> then<00:05:05.910> we<00:05:06.090> would<00:05:06.180> have<00:05:06.240> all<00:05:06.480> six<00:05:06.960> or<00:05:07.230> at

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:07.320 
and then we would have all six or at

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:09.710 
and then we would have all six or at
least<00:05:07.470> off<00:05:07.680> like<00:05:08.070> five<00:05:08.340> out<00:05:08.550> of<00:05:08.580> six<00:05:08.790> guys<00:05:09.360> on

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:09.720 
least off like five out of six guys on

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:11.840 
least off like five out of six guys on
one<00:05:09.990> side<00:05:10.290> of<00:05:10.410> the<00:05:10.500> map<00:05:10.710> hold<00:05:11.160> you're<00:05:11.730> like

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:11.850 
one side of the map hold you're like

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:14.690 
one side of the map hold you're like
trying<00:05:12.090> to<00:05:12.270> get<00:05:12.480> to<00:05:12.660> the<00:05:12.870> bomb<00:05:13.320> but<00:05:13.950> as<00:05:14.190> soon<00:05:14.640> as

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:14.700 
trying to get to the bomb but as soon as

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:16.190 
trying to get to the bomb but as soon as
we<00:05:14.850> got<00:05:15.000> up<00:05:15.060> to<00:05:15.270> that<00:05:15.390> bomb<00:05:15.570> I<00:05:15.810> think<00:05:15.990> you<00:05:16.050> might

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:16.200 
we got up to that bomb I think you might

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:17.480 
we got up to that bomb I think you might
have<00:05:16.260> noticed<00:05:16.590> earlier<00:05:16.680> in<00:05:16.920> this<00:05:17.040> gameplay<00:05:17.250> I

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:17.490 
have noticed earlier in this gameplay I

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:20.180 
have noticed earlier in this gameplay I
just<00:05:17.730> didn't<00:05:17.910> point<00:05:18.090> it<00:05:18.180> out<00:05:18.470> we<00:05:19.470> like<00:05:19.770> all<00:05:20.130> the

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:20.190 
just didn't point it out we like all the

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:23.060 
just didn't point it out we like all the
guys<00:05:20.760> on<00:05:20.910> my<00:05:20.940> team<00:05:21.150> all<00:05:21.360> six<00:05:21.630> were<00:05:21.810> all<00:05:21.990> by<00:05:22.560> one

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:23.070 
guys on my team all six were all by one

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:24.200 
guys on my team all six were all by one
of<00:05:23.160> the<00:05:23.220> bombs<00:05:23.400> that<00:05:23.610> they<00:05:23.670> were<00:05:23.820> just<00:05:24.000> playing

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:24.210 
of the bombs that they were just playing

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:26.030 
of the bombs that they were just playing
it<00:05:24.330> on<00:05:24.450> and<00:05:24.660> I<00:05:25.080> had<00:05:25.200> killed<00:05:25.500> a<00:05:25.620> couple<00:05:25.770> people

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:26.040 
it on and I had killed a couple people

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:28.040 
it on and I had killed a couple people
and<00:05:26.460> like<00:05:26.730> this<00:05:27.000> one<00:05:27.180> guy<00:05:27.330> just<00:05:27.570> stood<00:05:27.810> next<00:05:27.840> to

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:28.050 
and like this one guy just stood next to

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:29.300 
and like this one guy just stood next to
the<00:05:28.170> bomb<00:05:28.290> didn't<00:05:28.620> even<00:05:28.710> go<00:05:28.890> for<00:05:29.040> it<00:05:29.160> another

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:29.310 
the bomb didn't even go for it another

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:31.160 
the bomb didn't even go for it another
guy<00:05:29.490> walk<00:05:29.760> past<00:05:30.000> the<00:05:30.090> bomb<00:05:30.270> didn't<00:05:30.840> even<00:05:30.930> go

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:31.170 
guy walk past the bomb didn't even go

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:32.750 
guy walk past the bomb didn't even go
for<00:05:31.380> it<00:05:31.470> and<00:05:31.590> I<00:05:31.650> ended<00:05:31.920> up<00:05:32.010> having<00:05:32.190> to<00:05:32.400> go<00:05:32.550> for

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:32.760 
for it and I ended up having to go for

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:34.520 
for it and I ended up having to go for
it<00:05:32.880> even<00:05:33.000> though<00:05:33.330> I<00:05:33.480> was<00:05:33.660> like<00:05:33.810> the<00:05:34.110> farthest

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:34.530 
it even though I was like the farthest

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:36.680 
it even though I was like the farthest
one<00:05:34.680> from<00:05:34.980> it<00:05:35.130> just<00:05:35.550> because<00:05:35.880> people<00:05:35.910> they

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:36.690 
one from it just because people they
