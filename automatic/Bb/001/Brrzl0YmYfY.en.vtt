00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
actually went on the second night of it

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.799 
actually went on the second night of it
originally<00:00:44.579> opening<00:00:45.030> so<00:00:45.239> that's<00:00:45.420> usually

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
originally opening so that's usually

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.990 
originally opening so that's usually
when<00:00:46.050> not<00:00:46.590> not<00:00:46.950> much<00:00:47.190> will<00:00:47.430> change<00:00:47.460> obviously

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
when not not much will change obviously

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.340 
when not not much will change obviously
certain<00:00:48.420> things<00:00:48.750> will<00:00:48.899> change<00:00:48.930> because

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
certain things will change because

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:50.990 
certain things will change because
certain<00:00:49.920> things<00:00:50.100> do<00:00:50.280> go<00:00:50.489> wrong<00:00:50.520> when<00:00:50.850> they<00:00:50.940> do

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000

into<00:02:13.260> that<00:02:13.379> and<00:02:13.680> I<00:02:13.920> just<00:02:14.129> feel<00:02:14.340> like<00:02:14.400> maybe

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290 
into that and I just feel like maybe

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:17.630 
into that and I just feel like maybe
they<00:02:16.290> sort<00:02:16.590> of<00:02:16.680> missed<00:02:16.890> out<00:02:17.099> on<00:02:17.129> a<00:02:17.340> slight

they sort of missed out on a slight
trick<00:02:18.000> there<00:02:18.329> I<00:02:18.540> think<00:02:19.500> every<00:02:19.920> child<00:02:19.950> that

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:01.290 
sometimes the songs were a bit and then

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:04.750 
sometimes the songs were a bit and then
like<00:04:02.250> I<00:04:02.430> can't<00:04:02.760> tell<00:04:03.090> you<00:04:03.360> one<00:04:03.689> song<00:04:04.079> that<00:04:04.409> has
