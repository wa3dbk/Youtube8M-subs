00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
because it shows a lot of action and I

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.740 
because it shows a lot of action and I
really<00:01:31.890> like<00:01:32.070> to<00:01:32.189> be<00:01:32.340> in<00:01:32.579> the<00:01:32.970> action<00:01:33.450> kind<00:01:33.659> of

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
really like to be in the action kind of

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.620 
really like to be in the action kind of
thing<00:01:33.930> so<00:01:34.229> that's<00:01:34.770> why<00:01:35.159> active<00:01:35.880> aggression<00:01:36.180> to

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
thing so that's why active aggression to

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.319 
thing so that's why active aggression to
me<00:01:36.810> looks<00:01:37.229> a<00:01:37.530> lot<00:01:38.009> more<00:01:38.070> interesting<00:01:38.579> than

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
me looks a lot more interesting than

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.450 
me looks a lot more interesting than
some<00:01:39.659> of<00:01:39.780> the<00:01:39.990> games<00:01:40.470> that<00:01:40.619> you<00:01:40.860> ten<00:01:41.070> systems

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
some of the games that you ten systems

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.039 
some of the games that you ten systems
have<00:01:41.670> come<00:01:41.880> out<00:01:42.030> recently<00:01:42.180> like<00:01:42.750> because<00:01:42.960> I

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
have come out recently like because I

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:44.960 
have come out recently like because I
really<00:01:43.409> like<00:01:43.560> to<00:01:43.710> be<00:01:43.829> in<00:01:44.070> there<00:01:44.340> in<00:01:44.490> the<00:01:44.579> action

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
really like to be in there in the action

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.480 
really like to be in there in the action
so<00:01:45.240> this<00:01:45.869> is<00:01:46.020> kind<00:01:46.229> of<00:01:46.290> likes<00:01:46.530> reminiscent<00:01:47.369> of

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
so this is kind of likes reminiscent of

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.240 
so this is kind of likes reminiscent of
like<00:01:47.909> command<00:01:48.689> and<00:01:48.869> conquer<00:01:49.439> looks<00:01:50.009> like

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
like command and conquer looks like

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:51.859 
like command and conquer looks like
there's<00:01:50.490> like<00:01:50.700> some<00:01:50.909> company<00:01:51.149> of<00:01:51.420> heroes<00:01:51.840> in

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
there's like some company of heroes in

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.109 
there's like some company of heroes in
there<00:01:52.320> and<00:01:52.560> a<00:01:52.619> mix<00:01:52.950> of<00:01:53.159> some<00:01:53.340> other<00:01:53.520> strategy

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
there and a mix of some other strategy

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.480 
there and a mix of some other strategy
games<00:01:54.360> just<00:01:55.170> enough<00:01:55.470> to<00:01:55.500> maybe<00:01:55.890> make<00:01:56.250> this

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
games just enough to maybe make this

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.380 
games just enough to maybe make this
another<00:01:57.450> gem<00:01:57.930> I<00:01:58.200> really<00:01:58.680> hope<00:01:58.890> so

00:01:59.380 --> 00:01:59.390 
another gem I really hope so

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:02.060 
another gem I really hope so
unfortunately<00:02:00.390> I<00:02:00.659> didn't<00:02:01.320> get<00:02:01.560> to<00:02:01.619> get<00:02:01.920> my

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
unfortunately I didn't get to get my

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.550

game is all about unfortunately you only

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.839 
game is all about unfortunately you only
get<00:02:22.170> to<00:02:22.260> see<00:02:22.290> one<00:02:22.709> of<00:02:22.799> the<00:02:22.920> three<00:02:23.189> factions<00:02:23.489> I

00:02:23.839 --> 00:02:23.849 
get to see one of the three factions I

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:24.740 
get to see one of the three factions I
believe<00:02:24.120> there's<00:02:24.299> only<00:02:24.420> going<00:02:24.569> to<00:02:24.629> be<00:02:24.689> three

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
believe there's only going to be three

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:27.410 
believe there's only going to be three
factions<00:02:25.140> you<00:02:26.099> get<00:02:26.220> to<00:02:26.340> see<00:02:26.489> the<00:02:26.610> u.s.<00:02:26.909> faction

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
factions you get to see the u.s. faction

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.750 
factions you get to see the u.s. faction
which<00:02:27.989> can't<00:02:28.409> utilize<00:02:28.709> the<00:02:29.370> high-end

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
which can't utilize the high-end

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.789 
which can't utilize the high-end
resources<00:02:30.450> so<00:02:30.959> they're<00:02:31.140> not<00:02:31.319> really<00:02:31.530> like<00:02:31.769> a

00:02:31.789 --> 00:02:31.799 
resources so they're not really like a

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:34.100 
resources so they're not really like a
tech<00:02:32.280> race<00:02:32.579> and<00:02:32.909> I<00:02:33.209> guess<00:02:33.420> they<00:02:33.569> have<00:02:33.750> like<00:02:33.780> an

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
tech race and I guess they have like an

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:36.080 
tech race and I guess they have like an
aging<00:02:34.590> Army<00:02:34.950> kind<00:02:35.159> of<00:02:35.250> thing<00:02:35.370> going<00:02:35.579> on<00:02:35.760> and

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
aging Army kind of thing going on and

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:37.880 
aging Army kind of thing going on and
the<00:02:36.510> other<00:02:36.659> two<00:02:36.870> races<00:02:37.290> are<00:02:37.470> a<00:02:37.500> little<00:02:37.680> more

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
the other two races are a little more

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:40.130 
the other two races are a little more
techie<00:02:38.159> so<00:02:38.609> that<00:02:39.390> kind<00:02:39.599> of<00:02:39.659> makes<00:02:39.720> me<00:02:39.989> wonder

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
techie so that kind of makes me wonder

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:42.289 
techie so that kind of makes me wonder
what<00:02:40.859> race<00:02:41.099> that<00:02:41.129> I'm<00:02:41.519> kind<00:02:41.730> of<00:02:41.819> kind<00:02:42.000> of<00:02:42.150> latch

00:02:42.289 --> 00:02:42.299 
what race that I'm kind of kind of latch

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:44.119 
what race that I'm kind of kind of latch
on<00:02:42.510> because<00:02:42.720> usually<00:02:42.870> I<00:02:43.079> latch<00:02:43.409> on<00:02:43.650> to<00:02:43.680> like<00:02:43.980> I

00:02:44.119 --> 00:02:44.129 
on because usually I latch on to like I

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:46.099 
on because usually I latch on to like I
would<00:02:44.250> be<00:02:44.370> the<00:02:44.519> USA<00:02:45.030> or<00:02:45.060> I'm<00:02:45.420> always<00:02:45.540> a<00:02:45.659> humans

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:46.109 
would be the USA or I'm always a humans

00:02:46.109 --> 00:02:49.240 
would be the USA or I'm always a humans
in<00:02:46.260> space<00:02:46.379> game<00:02:46.799> so<00:02:47.239> that<00:02:48.239> kind<00:02:48.540> of<00:02:48.599> thing

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:49.250 
in space game so that kind of thing

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:52.699 
in space game so that kind of thing
anyway<00:02:50.250> I<00:02:50.280> am<00:02:50.670> really<00:02:51.030> hopeful<00:02:51.720> for<00:02:52.109> active

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:52.709 
anyway I am really hopeful for active

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:55.280 
anyway I am really hopeful for active
aggression<00:02:53.099> the<00:02:53.819> game<00:02:54.060> looks<00:02:54.480> exactly<00:02:55.049> like

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
aggression the game looks exactly like

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:57.199

something<00:02:55.739> that<00:02:56.010> I<00:02:56.250> would<00:02:56.549> want<00:02:56.790> out<00:02:57.000> of<00:02:57.030> a

00:02:57.199 --> 00:02:57.209 
something that I would want out of a

00:02:57.209 --> 00:02:59.690 
something that I would want out of a
ground<00:02:57.480> combat<00:02:57.980> realtime<00:02:58.980> strategy<00:02:59.129> game

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
ground combat realtime strategy game

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:01.910 
ground combat realtime strategy game
