churches<00:00:28.820> now<00:00:29.820> here<00:00:30.750> are<00:00:30.990> two<00:00:31.019> churches<00:00:31.650> over

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
churches now here are two churches over

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.729 
churches now here are two churches over
here<00:00:32.700> all<00:00:33.239> right<00:00:33.510> and<00:00:33.660> if<00:00:33.989> I<00:00:34.140> double-click<00:00:34.500> on

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
here all right and if I double-click on

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.400 
here all right and if I double-click on
them<00:00:34.980> it<00:00:35.130> will<00:00:35.610> highlight<00:00:35.820> all<00:00:36.180> churches<00:00:36.750> to

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
them it will highlight all churches to

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.290 
them it will highlight all churches to
show<00:00:37.590> you<00:00:37.649> the<00:00:37.890> full<00:00:38.190> coverage<00:00:38.670> for<00:00:39.180> the

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
show you the full coverage for the

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.600 
show you the full coverage for the
entire<00:00:39.600> region<00:00:39.870> and<00:00:40.739> as<00:00:40.829> you<00:00:41.010> can<00:00:41.160> see<00:00:41.190> there

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
entire region and as you can see there

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.280 
entire region and as you can see there
are<00:00:41.730> buildings<00:00:42.000> out<00:00:42.300> here<00:00:42.570> with<00:00:42.719> exclamation

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
are buildings out here with exclamation

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:44.900 
are buildings out here with exclamation
points<00:00:43.559> about<00:00:43.710> their<00:00:43.890> heads<00:00:44.040> that<00:00:44.250> don't<00:00:44.700> have

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
points about their heads that don't have

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.020 
points about their heads that don't have
any<00:00:45.090> coverage<00:00:45.480> and<00:00:46.070> clearly<00:00:47.070> these<00:00:47.730> two

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
any coverage and clearly these two

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.029 
any coverage and clearly these two
chapels<00:00:48.539> are<00:00:48.719> interfering<00:00:49.170> with<00:00:49.379> Egypt<00:00:49.860> not

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
chapels are interfering with Egypt not

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:51.500 
chapels are interfering with Egypt not
interfering<00:00:50.520> with<00:00:50.550> each<00:00:50.700> other<00:00:50.940> but<00:00:51.149> there's

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
interfering with each other but there's

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.840 
interfering with each other but there's
wasted<00:00:51.930> space<00:00:52.199> here<00:00:52.559> because<00:00:53.250> this<00:00:53.460> circle

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
wasted space here because this circle

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.160 
wasted space here because this circle
probably<00:00:54.180> goes<00:00:54.329> like<00:00:54.510> this<00:00:54.690> and<00:00:54.989> then<00:00:55.140> this

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
probably goes like this and then this

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:56.720 
probably goes like this and then this
circle<00:00:55.649> probably<00:00:55.920> goes<00:00:56.039> like<00:00:56.190> that<00:00:56.370> so<00:00:56.610> they

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
circle probably goes like that so they

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.310 
circle probably goes like that so they
don't<00:00:56.910> most<00:00:57.480> certainly<00:00:57.780> don't<00:00:57.989> need<00:00:58.079> to<00:00:58.230> be

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
don't most certainly don't need to be

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.709 
don't most certainly don't need to be
that<00:00:58.350> close<00:00:58.500> together<00:00:59.270> so<00:01:00.270> what<00:01:00.480> I'm<00:01:00.570> going<00:01:00.660> to

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
that close together so what I'm going to

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.510 
that close together so what I'm going to
do<00:01:00.870> is<00:01:00.989> move<00:01:01.109> one<00:01:01.350> of<00:01:01.440> them<00:01:01.559> now<00:01:02.309> the<00:01:02.370> question

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
do is move one of them now the question

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.960 
do is move one of them now the question
is<00:01:02.730> well<00:01:02.910> where<00:01:03.030> do<00:01:03.149> I<00:01:03.210> move<00:01:03.390> it<00:01:03.570> to<00:01:03.719> well

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:04.970 
is well where do I move it to well

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:07.160 
is well where do I move it to well
that's<00:01:05.970> where<00:01:06.210> sphere<00:01:06.479> of<00:01:06.510> influence<00:01:06.720> comes

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
that's where sphere of influence comes

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:14.600 
that's where sphere of influence comes
in<00:01:07.350> if<00:01:07.560> I<00:01:08.310> drag<00:01:08.670> this<00:01:08.700> out<00:01:09.210> here<00:01:10.670> in<00:01:12.380> a<00:01:13.380> way<00:01:13.619> you

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
in if I drag this out here in a way you

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.109 
in if I drag this out here in a way you
can<00:01:14.850> see<00:01:15.240> that<00:01:15.900> there<00:01:16.290> is<00:01:16.320> a<00:01:17.070> let<00:01:17.729> me<00:01:17.820> just<00:01:18.000> drop

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
can see that there is a let me just drop

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:22.820 
can see that there is a let me just drop
this<00:01:18.330> out<00:01:18.540> here<00:01:21.170> you<00:01:22.170> can<00:01:22.290> see<00:01:22.470> that<00:01:22.650> this

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
this out here you can see that this

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.630 
this out here you can see that this
circle<00:01:23.420> all<00:01:24.420> right<00:01:24.780> no<00:01:25.320> longer<00:01:25.740> touches<00:01:26.250> this

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
circle all right no longer touches this

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.120 
circle all right no longer touches this
circle<00:01:27.150> but<00:01:27.900> there<00:01:28.080> are<00:01:28.200> now<00:01:28.350> buildings<00:01:28.890> in

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
circle but there are now buildings in

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:30.859 
circle but there are now buildings in
between<00:01:29.640> that<00:01:29.939> aren't<00:01:30.180> covered<00:01:30.360> by<00:01:30.540> either

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
between that aren't covered by either

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.170 
between that aren't covered by either
church<00:01:31.350> so<00:01:32.040> I<00:01:32.070> actually<00:01:32.340> have<00:01:32.640> to<00:01:32.759> squish<00:01:33.000> this

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
church so I actually have to squish this

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:34.760 
church so I actually have to squish this
one<00:01:33.390> in<00:01:33.540> a<00:01:33.659> little<00:01:33.900> bit<00:01:34.049> in<00:01:34.229> order<00:01:34.409> to<00:01:34.590> make

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
one in a little bit in order to make

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.700 
one in a little bit in order to make
sure<00:01:34.799> that<00:01:35.100> everyone<00:01:36.000> gets<00:01:36.030> covered<00:01:36.659> here<00:01:36.869> so

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
sure that everyone gets covered here so

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.530 
sure that everyone gets covered here so
i<00:01:38.189> think<00:01:38.549> my<00:01:38.700> spot<00:01:38.970> for<00:01:39.150> that<00:01:39.270> it's<00:01:39.360> going<00:01:39.479> to

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
i think my spot for that it's going to

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.080 
i think my spot for that it's going to
be<00:01:39.630> right<00:01:39.840> here<00:01:40.170> and<00:01:40.350> indeed<00:01:40.799> it<00:01:40.950> is<00:01:41.090> now

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
be right here and indeed it is now

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.749 
be right here and indeed it is now
there's<00:01:42.329> a<00:01:42.390> little<00:01:42.750> bit<00:01:42.960> just<00:01:43.290> a<00:01:43.500> touch<00:01:44.159> of<00:01:44.520> an

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
there's a little bit just a touch of an

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:48.530 
there's a little bit just a touch of an
overlap<00:01:46.430> so<00:01:47.430> now<00:01:47.640> if<00:01:47.939> i<00:01:48.060> click<00:01:48.210> on<00:01:48.329> one<00:01:48.509> of

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
overlap so now if i click on one of

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.520 
overlap so now if i click on one of
these<00:01:48.659> buildings<00:01:48.930> oh<00:01:51.020> this<00:01:52.020> doesn't<00:01:52.259> have<00:01:52.500> a

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
these buildings oh this doesn't have a

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.060 
these buildings oh this doesn't have a
marketplace<00:01:52.950> alright<00:01:53.610> so<00:01:53.909> let's<00:01:54.210> handle<00:01:54.630> that

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:55.070 
marketplace alright so let's handle that

00:01:55.070 --> 00:02:00.469 
marketplace alright so let's handle that
we<00:01:56.070> go<00:01:56.280> to<00:01:56.780> hear<00:01:57.780> marketplace<00:01:59.090> now<00:02:00.090> again

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
we go to hear marketplace now again

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.300 
we go to hear marketplace now again
marketplace<00:02:01.229> is<00:02:01.380> just<00:02:01.590> like<00:02:01.710> churches<00:02:02.130> have<00:02:02.280> a

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
marketplace is just like churches have a

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.219 
marketplace is just like churches have a
sphere<00:02:02.579> of<00:02:02.640> influence<00:02:02.850> and<00:02:03.390> you<00:02:03.750> can<00:02:03.930> see<00:02:04.200> that

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
sphere of influence and you can see that

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:06.920 
sphere of influence and you can see that
down<00:02:04.860> here<00:02:05.100> there's<00:02:05.310> a<00:02:05.369> one<00:02:05.790> of<00:02:05.880> these<00:02:06.000> so<00:02:06.390> you

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
down here there's a one of these so you

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.290 
down here there's a one of these so you
know<00:02:07.020> the<00:02:07.560> circle<00:02:08.069> go<00:02:08.250> ends<00:02:08.580> like<00:02:08.849> right<00:02:09.090> there

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
know the circle go ends like right there

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.900 
know the circle go ends like right there
now<00:02:10.200> I<00:02:10.229> could<00:02:10.560> go<00:02:10.770> in<00:02:10.920> this<00:02:11.039> direction<00:02:11.099> but<00:02:11.700> I

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
now I could go in this direction but I

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.490 
now I could go in this direction but I
bet<00:02:12.180> leaves<00:02:12.450> like<00:02:12.660> this<00:02:12.900> little

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
bet leaves like this little

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.350 
bet leaves like this little
any<00:02:13.620> area<00:02:14.070> over<00:02:14.430> here<00:02:14.460> that<00:02:14.940> doesn't<00:02:15.150> have

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
any area over here that doesn't have

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.770 
any area over here that doesn't have
anything<00:02:15.630> so<00:02:16.470> I<00:02:16.500> think<00:02:16.620> the<00:02:16.950> better<00:02:17.190> way<00:02:17.340> to<00:02:17.520> go

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:17.780 
anything so I think the better way to go

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:21.920 
anything so I think the better way to go
would<00:02:18.780> be<00:02:18.840> to<00:02:19.020> drop<00:02:19.560> this<00:02:19.830> over<00:02:20.310> here<00:02:20.820> and<00:02:21.030> that

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
would be to drop this over here and that

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:23.600 
would be to drop this over here and that
will<00:02:22.080> give<00:02:22.110> me<00:02:22.380> coverage<00:02:22.830> for<00:02:23.040> all<00:02:23.070> of<00:02:23.460> these

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
will give me coverage for all of these

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:30.140 
will give me coverage for all of these
buildings<00:02:25.040> and<00:02:27.830> then<00:02:28.830> I<00:02:28.860> can<00:02:29.310> worry<00:02:29.550> about<00:02:29.640> you

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
buildings and then I can worry about you

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.180 
buildings and then I can worry about you
know<00:02:30.240> this<00:02:30.540> future<00:02:30.930> space<00:02:31.200> later<00:02:31.500> because

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
know this future space later because

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:33.830 
know this future space later because
this<00:02:32.370> is<00:02:32.520> going<00:02:32.580> to<00:02:32.700> be<00:02:32.880> you<00:02:33.180> know<00:02:33.240> my<00:02:33.510> city

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
this is going to be you know my city

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:37.310 
this is going to be you know my city
will<00:02:34.080> extend<00:02:34.470> well<00:02:34.770> over<00:02:35.070> into<00:02:35.370> here<00:02:35.640> but<00:02:36.320> this

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:37.320 
will extend well over into here but this

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:39.380 
will extend well over into here but this
just<00:02:38.070> to<00:02:38.220> make<00:02:38.370> sure<00:02:38.400> that<00:02:38.670> these<00:02:38.820> spaces<00:02:39.030> up

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
just to make sure that these spaces up

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:40.820 
just to make sure that these spaces up
here<00:02:39.630> get<00:02:39.810> covered<00:02:40.140> which<00:02:40.350> I<00:02:40.470> think<00:02:40.680> there's

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830 
here get covered which I think there's

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:43.010 
here get covered which I think there's
going<00:02:40.920> to<00:02:41.010> be<00:02:41.040> houses<00:02:41.459> here<00:02:41.730> then<00:02:42.360> you<00:02:42.660> know<00:02:42.780> I

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:43.020 
going to be houses here then you know I

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:44.890 
going to be houses here then you know I
can<00:02:43.200> leave<00:02:43.560> this<00:02:43.590> small<00:02:43.980> market<00:02:44.310> place<00:02:44.490> here

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
can leave this small market place here

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:49.220 
can leave this small market place here
so<00:02:45.900> now<00:02:46.140> we<00:02:47.100> have<00:02:47.300> community<00:02:48.300> and<00:02:48.840> we<00:02:49.080> have

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
so now we have community and we have

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:51.860 
so now we have community and we have
faith<00:02:49.560> but<00:02:49.890> we<00:02:49.980> do<00:02:50.100> not<00:02:50.250> have<00:02:50.489> services<00:02:51.120> and

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
faith but we do not have services and

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:53.510 
faith but we do not have services and
the<00:02:52.020> question<00:02:52.350> is<00:02:52.440> why<00:02:52.620> is<00:02:52.680> that<00:02:52.830> and<00:02:53.220> it's

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:53.520 
the question is why is that and it's

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:58.690 
the question is why is that and it's
because<00:02:54.230> if<00:02:55.230> I<00:02:55.380> find<00:02:55.739> yours<00:02:56.400> carpenter

00:02:58.690 --> 00:02:58.700 
because if I find yours carpenter

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:02.570 
because if I find yours carpenter
services<00:03:00.530> don't<00:03:01.530> extend<00:03:01.920> out<00:03:02.130> to<00:03:02.160> here

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:02.580 
services don't extend out to here

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:04.130 
services don't extend out to here
because<00:03:02.910> the<00:03:03.000> carpenter<00:03:03.480> has<00:03:03.660> a<00:03:03.690> slightly

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 
because the carpenter has a slightly

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:06.949 
because the carpenter has a slightly
smaller<00:03:04.320> circle<00:03:04.980> so<00:03:05.220> it<00:03:05.550> ends<00:03:05.910> right<00:03:05.940> there<00:03:06.090> so

00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:06.959 
smaller circle so it ends right there so

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:09.380 
smaller circle so it ends right there so
I<00:03:06.989> also<00:03:07.230> need<00:03:07.500> a<00:03:07.530> carpenter<00:03:07.950> so<00:03:08.270> we're<00:03:09.270> going

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:09.390 
I also need a carpenter so we're going

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:14.660 
I also need a carpenter so we're going
to<00:03:09.660> hunt<00:03:09.900> down<00:03:09.989> carpenter<00:03:10.530> and<00:03:11.180> so<00:03:13.670> think

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:14.670 
to hunt down carpenter and so think

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:16.790 
to hunt down carpenter and so think
right<00:03:14.940> here<00:03:15.480> would<00:03:15.810> be<00:03:15.870> a<00:03:16.020> good<00:03:16.230> spot<00:03:16.410> because

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:16.800 
right here would be a good spot because

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:19.729 
right here would be a good spot because
it<00:03:17.280> covers<00:03:17.489> again<00:03:17.940> that<00:03:18.330> little<00:03:18.750> tiny<00:03:19.049> spot<00:03:19.590> up

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:19.739 
it covers again that little tiny spot up

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:24.470 
it covers again that little tiny spot up
there<00:03:19.769> in<00:03:20.190> the<00:03:20.660> like<00:03:21.660> up<00:03:21.840> top<00:03:23.209> so<00:03:24.209> we'll<00:03:24.360> drop

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 
there in the like up top so we'll drop

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.990 
there in the like up top so we'll drop
that<00:03:24.660> right<00:03:24.810> there<00:03:25.019> now<00:03:25.920> all<00:03:26.280> three<00:03:26.670> of<00:03:26.790> these

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 
that right there now all three of these

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.240 
that right there now all three of these
buildings<00:03:27.450> have<00:03:27.540> all<00:03:27.989> the<00:03:28.350> things<00:03:28.950> that<00:03:29.100> they

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:29.250 
buildings have all the things that they

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:31.850 
buildings have all the things that they
need<00:03:29.489> and<00:03:29.700> people<00:03:30.510> can<00:03:30.840> begin<00:03:31.140> moving<00:03:31.380> into
