you want I'm just going to perform an
ambient<00:01:05.460> light<00:01:05.900> check<00:01:06.900> so<00:01:07.350> I<00:01:07.710> got<00:01:08.040> to<00:01:08.130> make

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
ambient light check so I got to make

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:09.710 
ambient light check so I got to make
sure<00:01:08.430> that<00:01:08.610> that<00:01:08.880> is<00:01:09.119> checked

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
sure that that is checked

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.490 
sure that that is checked
can<00:01:10.350> I<00:01:10.439> go<00:01:10.650> forward<00:01:11.659> at<00:01:12.659> this<00:01:12.900> point<00:01:13.260> it's

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
can I go forward at this point it's

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.280 
can I go forward at this point it's
asking<00:01:13.950> you<00:01:14.159> to<00:01:14.189> attach<00:01:14.790> the<00:01:15.180> ambient<00:01:15.990> light

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
spectrophotometer you open it up there's

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:30.700 
spectrophotometer you open it up there's
actually<00:01:27.659> two<00:01:28.020> caps<00:01:28.470> in<00:01:28.890> here<00:01:29.189> one<00:01:29.520> has<00:01:30.150> the

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:30.710 
actually two caps in here one has the

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:33.830 
actually two caps in here one has the
ambient<00:01:31.710> filter<00:01:32.130> in<00:01:32.280> it<00:01:32.430> the<00:01:32.970> other<00:01:33.180> one<00:01:33.450> is<00:01:33.659> a

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
ambient filter in it the other one is a

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.560 
ambient filter in it the other one is a
solid<00:01:34.320> black<00:01:34.470> on<00:01:34.890> the<00:01:35.040> outside<00:01:36.890> you<00:01:37.890> attach<00:01:38.220> it

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:38.570 
solid black on the outside you attach it

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:41.510 
solid black on the outside you attach it
to<00:01:39.570> your<00:01:39.600> instrument<00:01:40.350> you'll<00:01:40.770> notice<00:01:41.189> on<00:01:41.400> the

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
to your instrument you'll notice on the

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.030 
to your instrument you'll notice on the
inside<00:01:41.670> of<00:01:41.939> the<00:01:42.180> cap<00:01:42.420> there's<00:01:42.750> three<00:01:43.229> locking

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
inside of the cap there's three locking

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:48.260 
inside of the cap there's three locking
tabs<00:01:44.640> and<00:01:45.329> those<00:01:46.189> fit<00:01:47.189> over<00:01:47.729> the<00:01:47.880> three

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
tabs and those fit over the three

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.490 
tabs and those fit over the three
notches<00:01:49.170> on<00:01:49.770> the<00:01:49.829> reed<00:01:50.310> head<00:01:50.930> and<00:01:51.930> then<00:01:52.320> you

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
notches on the reed head and then you

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.100 
notches on the reed head and then you
rotate<00:01:52.979> it<00:01:53.189> slightly

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:00.550 
when you rotate it it is attached right

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:04.680 
when you rotate it it is attached right

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:45.940 
luminance you'll see that my color

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:48.350 
luminance you'll see that my color
temperature<00:02:46.600> is<00:02:46.870> currently<00:02:47.320> a<00:02:47.410> little<00:02:47.740> low<00:02:47.920> at

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 
temperature is currently a little low at

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:55.140 
temperature is currently a little low at

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.150 
3800 in my luminance is 159 Lux a little

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:57.870 
3800 in my luminance is 159 Lux a little
bit<00:02:55.330> high<00:02:55.860> this<00:02:56.860> would<00:02:57.100> tell<00:02:57.310> you<00:02:57.459> that<00:02:57.700> I'm

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:57.880 
bit high this would tell you that I'm

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:02.330 
bit high this would tell you that I'm
probably<00:02:58.570> not<00:02:59.459> using<00:03:00.459> good<00:03:00.850> lighting<00:03:01.360> for

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:07.570 
evaluating prints and such so that's how

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:11.550 
evaluating prints and such so that's how
you<00:03:07.630> read<00:03:08.170> your<00:03:08.410> ambient<00:03:08.860> room<00:03:09.130> lighting
