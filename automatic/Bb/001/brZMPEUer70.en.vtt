back<00:00:40.680> on<00:00:41.420> and<00:00:42.420> I<00:00:43.170> think<00:00:43.410> we<00:00:43.530> did<00:00:43.710> a<00:00:43.739> pretty<00:00:43.800> nice

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
back on and I think we did a pretty nice

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:48.020 
back on and I think we did a pretty nice
job<00:00:45.170> if<00:00:46.170> you<00:00:46.410> look<00:00:46.739> right<00:00:47.370> above<00:00:47.640> the<00:00:47.820> wheel

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
job if you look right above the wheel

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.990 
job if you look right above the wheel
well<00:00:48.590> you<00:00:49.590> can't<00:00:49.860> even<00:00:49.980> tell<00:00:50.250> where<00:00:50.430> we<00:00:50.640> grab

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
well you can't even tell where we grab

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.729 
well you can't even tell where we grab
them<00:00:51.270> on<00:00:51.649> and<00:00:52.699> we're<00:00:53.699> all<00:00:53.910> left<00:00:54.239> off<00:00:54.780> of<00:00:54.989> 67

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
them on and we're all left off of 67

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.360 
them on and we're all left off of 67
Mustangs<00:00:56.250> and<00:00:57.050> so<00:00:58.050> it's<00:00:58.140> perfect<00:00:58.649> for<00:00:58.710> a<00:00:58.890> 28
