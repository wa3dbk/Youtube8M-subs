00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:17.340
 finished products I do not have many but 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:22.460
 Well have decided to do it already because 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:22.460
 I get rid of them then good 

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:33.150
 The first product that finished good is 

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:36.030
 a gel of calls and Grunfeld 

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:39.350
 to say that it's my favorite of all is 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:43.399
 knit you can not find 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:45.589
 now he usually goes out at Christmas and 

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:48.019
 well what are we going to catch many and 

00:00:45.589 --> 00:00:50.480
 Well, I finish them not then this is 

00:00:48.019 --> 00:00:53.690
 one and well I have to say that it smells 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:55.339
 well it smells like sweet sweets 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:57.260
 it reminds me like that one when you go 

00:00:55.339 --> 00:01:02.079
 to a candy store and it smells 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:04.729
 superbly has 500 grams and good 

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:07.800
 It serves both for hair and body 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:13.600
 but I use it only for body 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:15.580
 and I like it a lot 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:19.540
 the next product that I have finished 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:23.110
 it was a mask is from the skin brand 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:24.940
 79 and I thought I was going to like it but not 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:26.290
 I liked nothing is a mask 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:30.549
 those that have the shape of the face that 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:33.299
 they have the trimmed and the mouth and I do not 

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:36.130
 they're nothing is supposed to be a mask 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:40.539
 of hydration than from cotton 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:43.860
 they install 100% and well I did not buy it 

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:45.940
 came in a box of these lips 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:49.110
 I think it was 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:51.620
 and we liked nothing 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.620
 was 

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:57.600
 you did not have much water it was a I do not know 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:59.460
 now I know 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:03.150
 what you have to do was put cloth 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:05.670
 than leave it for 15 minutes to remove it and with 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:09.360
 what you had left you had it 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:13.020
 to scrub until you leave it like that 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:16.650
 well this is the product that I have 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:20.120
 finished is a foam of hair is called 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:23.130
 part is in particular is the volume 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:27.000
 volume with movement that is supposed to 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:29.100
 is the strongest and then before I 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.590
 I really like how to start the hair if 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:33.750
 you want to get something fairly 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:35.790
 cheap then there are the brands 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:40.020
 professionals but they are much more 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:42.600
 faces and good I think for the summer 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:44.520
 to go to the beach and so then afterwards 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:49.470
 want to go to us is to get me out 

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:52.050
 the hair well and good is very method and in 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:53.330
 I conceive the line I liked a lot now 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:57.040
 I'm with the 'red' because I was wrong 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:59.799

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:20.799

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:23.530
