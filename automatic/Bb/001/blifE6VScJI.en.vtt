they<00:00:56.219> generally<00:00:56.940> and<00:00:57.210> I<00:00:57.750> say<00:00:57.960> generally<00:00:58.500> will

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
they generally and I say generally will

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.470 
they generally and I say generally will
not<00:00:58.680> harm<00:00:59.100> fish<00:00:59.430> and<00:00:59.699> the<00:00:59.760> reason<00:01:00.030> I<00:01:00.120> mentioned

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
not harm fish and the reason I mentioned

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.000 
not harm fish and the reason I mentioned
this<00:01:00.570> is<00:01:00.750> many<00:01:00.960> small<00:01:01.260> pond<00:01:01.469> owners<00:01:01.649> get

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
this is many small pond owners get

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.500 
this is many small pond owners get
concerned<00:01:02.460> that<00:01:02.640> their<00:01:02.820> fish<00:01:03.000> will<00:01:03.180> suffer

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
concerned that their fish will suffer

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.750 
concerned that their fish will suffer
for<00:01:03.719> it<00:01:03.870> and<00:01:04.110> in<00:01:04.379> most<00:01:04.619> cases<00:01:04.890> they<00:01:05.250> don't<00:01:05.430> now

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
for it and in most cases they don't now

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.219 
for it and in most cases they don't now
where<00:01:06.000> you<00:01:06.180> will<00:01:06.390> run<00:01:06.600> into<00:01:06.720> problems

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
where you will run into problems

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.020 
where you will run into problems
sometimes<00:01:07.470> is<00:01:07.920> when<00:01:08.070> you<00:01:08.189> try<00:01:08.369> to<00:01:08.430> treat<00:01:08.729> this

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
sometimes is when you try to treat this

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.870 
sometimes is when you try to treat this
issue<00:01:09.360> chemically<00:01:10.260> and<00:01:11.100> perhaps<00:01:11.369> you'll<00:01:11.670> kill

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
issue chemically and perhaps you'll kill

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.940 
issue chemically and perhaps you'll kill
off<00:01:12.060> too<00:01:12.240> much<00:01:12.390> algae<00:01:12.869> with<00:01:13.080> poor<00:01:13.350> aeration

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
off too much algae with poor aeration

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.190 
off too much algae with poor aeration
and<00:01:14.100> you<00:01:14.159> can<00:01:14.430> harm<00:01:14.700> fish<00:01:14.970> that<00:01:15.240> way<00:01:15.479> or<00:01:16.049> you

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
and you can harm fish that way or you

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.520 
and you can harm fish that way or you
could<00:01:16.350> get<00:01:16.500> a<00:01:16.530> spike<00:01:16.890> in<00:01:17.070> in<00:01:17.369> copper

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:18.530 
could get a spike in in copper

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:21.620 
could get a spike in in copper
concentrations<00:01:19.530> in<00:01:19.710> the<00:01:19.740> water<00:01:20.450> which<00:01:21.450> is

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
concentrations in the water which is

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.020

toxic<00:01:21.840> to<00:01:22.200> fish<00:01:22.229> as<00:01:22.560> well<00:01:22.740> so<00:01:23.070> it's<00:01:23.700> for<00:01:23.909> this

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
toxic to fish as well so it's for this

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.240 
toxic to fish as well so it's for this
reason<00:01:24.180> particularly<00:01:24.960> with<00:01:25.080> small<00:01:25.439> ponds

too high a flow rate as well you may

too high a flow rate as well you may

little bit slower pass through the UV

00:05:30.669 --> 00:05:32.250 
little bit slower pass through the UV
and<00:05:30.700> it<00:05:30.940> may<00:05:31.090> help<00:05:31.300> control<00:05:31.780> things<00:05:32.020> better

waters large lakes ultrasound can help
on<00:05:46.419> green<00:05:46.840> water<00:05:47.080> issues<00:05:47.560> in<00:05:48.250> many<00:05:48.640> cases<00:05:49.180> it

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:49.390 
on green water issues in many cases it

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:51.240 
on green water issues in many cases it
is<00:05:49.570> not<00:05:49.810> a<00:05:49.840> hundred<00:05:50.020> percent<00:05:50.229> and<00:05:50.740> we<00:05:50.890> do<00:05:51.040> like

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:51.250 
is not a hundred percent and we do like

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:53.730 
is not a hundred percent and we do like
to<00:05:51.400> do<00:05:51.550> an<00:05:51.820> algae<00:05:52.540> analysis<00:05:53.169> to<00:05:53.350> see<00:05:53.560> what

00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:53.740 
to do an algae analysis to see what

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:55.920 
to do an algae analysis to see what
species<00:05:54.340> and<00:05:54.640> types<00:05:54.850> of<00:05:55.030> algae<00:05:55.210> you<00:05:55.390> have<00:05:55.690> in<00:05:55.870> a

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:55.930 
species and types of algae you have in a

00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:59.370 
species and types of algae you have in a
pond<00:05:56.169> first<00:05:56.710> but<00:05:57.520> if<00:05:58.240> this<00:05:58.600> matches<00:05:59.020> up<00:05:59.050> to<00:05:59.350> a

00:05:59.370 --> 00:05:59.380 
pond first but if this matches up to a

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:01.590 
pond first but if this matches up to a
database<00:05:59.830> of<00:06:00.010> successful<00:06:00.789> treatments<00:06:01.330> and

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:01.600 
database of successful treatments and

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:03.900 
database of successful treatments and
algae<00:06:02.350> types<00:06:02.590> then<00:06:02.860> oftentimes<00:06:03.220> we<00:06:03.610> can<00:06:03.789> get

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:03.910 
algae types then oftentimes we can get

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:06.450 
algae types then oftentimes we can get
very<00:06:04.120> good<00:06:04.330> control<00:06:04.570> and<00:06:05.050> again<00:06:05.890> we're<00:06:06.370> able

00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:06.460 
very good control and again we're able

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:08.790 
very good control and again we're able
to<00:06:06.640> do<00:06:06.760> this<00:06:06.900> cost-effectively<00:06:07.900> relatively

00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:08.800 
to do this cost-effectively relatively

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:10.740 
to do this cost-effectively relatively
speaking<00:06:09.070> compared<00:06:09.640> to<00:06:09.789> chemical<00:06:10.270> additives

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:10.750 
speaking compared to chemical additives

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:12.600 
speaking compared to chemical additives
and<00:06:10.960> things<00:06:11.169> like<00:06:11.350> that<00:06:11.650> and<00:06:11.919> so<00:06:12.039> ultrasound

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:12.610 
and things like that and so ultrasound

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:14.820 
and things like that and so ultrasound
has<00:06:12.789> definitely<00:06:13.360> been<00:06:13.570> one<00:06:14.169> of<00:06:14.229> our<00:06:14.440> favorite

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:14.830 
has definitely been one of our favorite

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:17.580 
has definitely been one of our favorite
tools<00:06:15.010> for<00:06:15.280> larger<00:06:15.610> water<00:06:15.850> so<00:06:16.570> I<00:06:16.900> hope<00:06:17.560> that

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:17.590 
tools for larger water so I hope that

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:20.310 
tools for larger water so I hope that
this<00:06:17.979> provides<00:06:18.400> some<00:06:18.849> degree<00:06:19.270> of<00:06:19.300> at<00:06:20.080> least

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:20.320 
this provides some degree of at least

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:23.070 
this provides some degree of at least
initial<00:06:21.599> direction<00:06:22.599> for

00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:23.080 
initial direction for

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:24.420 
initial direction for
folks<00:06:23.199> that<00:06:23.409> are<00:06:23.500> having<00:06:23.770> trouble<00:06:24.099> with<00:06:24.159> green

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:26.590 
water problems it is a very common issue

00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:28.649 
water problems it is a very common issue
in<00:06:26.889> ponds<00:06:27.280> particularly<00:06:28.120> as<00:06:28.210> the<00:06:28.419> summer

00:06:28.649 --> 00:06:28.659
