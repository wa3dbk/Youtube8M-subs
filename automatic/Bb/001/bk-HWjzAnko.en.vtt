00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:05.040 
okay we're back here with the hexacopter

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.740 
okay we're back here with the hexacopter
project<00:00:05.819> after<00:00:06.150> we<00:00:06.950> finished<00:00:07.950> the<00:00:08.069> ramp<00:00:08.370> and<00:00:08.750> I

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:09.750 
project after we finished the ramp and I

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:11.629 
project after we finished the ramp and I
work<00:00:09.929> on<00:00:10.050> my<00:00:10.200> bike<00:00:10.410> a<00:00:10.440> little<00:00:10.679> bit<00:00:10.980> and<00:00:11.190> hit<00:00:11.519> the

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639 
work on my bike a little bit and hit the

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:14.060 
work on my bike a little bit and hit the
horn<00:00:11.880> and<00:00:12.150> I<00:00:12.450> did<00:00:13.320> all<00:00:13.410> kind<00:00:13.590> of<00:00:13.620> other<00:00:13.740> stuff

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
horn and I did all kind of other stuff

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.779 
horn and I did all kind of other stuff
but<00:00:14.250> anyway<00:00:14.580> um<00:00:15.859> right<00:00:16.859> now<00:00:16.890> as<00:00:17.250> you<00:00:17.369> can<00:00:17.490> see<00:00:17.550> i

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
but anyway um right now as you can see i

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:21.740 
but anyway um right now as you can see i
got<00:00:18.119> the<00:00:18.240> power<00:00:18.449> board<00:00:18.810> hooked<00:00:19.529> up<00:00:20.750> soldiers

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
got the power board hooked up soldiers

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.839 
got the power board hooked up soldiers
stuff<00:00:22.020> in<00:00:22.170> there<00:00:22.400> and<00:00:24.260> also<00:00:25.400> as<00:00:26.400> you<00:00:26.550> can<00:00:26.699> see

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
stuff in there and also as you can see

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:29.470 
stuff in there and also as you can see
there's<00:00:27.029> no<00:00:27.180> no<00:00:27.480> wires<00:00:27.750> outside<00:00:28.050> of<00:00:28.529> the<00:00:28.650> frame

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:29.480 
there's no no wires outside of the frame

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:36.610 
there's no no wires outside of the frame
that's<00:00:30.480> because<00:00:31.309> we've<00:00:32.309> taken<00:00:34.190> these<00:00:35.190> wires

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:36.620 
that's because we've taken these wires

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:42.490 
that's because we've taken these wires
all<00:00:37.620> the<00:00:37.829> same<00:00:38.070> color<00:00:40.040> as<00:00:41.040> the<00:00:41.180> motors<00:00:42.180> and

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:42.500 
all the same color as the motors and

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:46.250 
all the same color as the motors and
running<00:00:43.500> through<00:00:43.710> inside<00:00:44.219> the<00:00:44.399> frame<00:00:44.690> as<00:00:45.690> you

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
running through inside the frame as you

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.690 
running through inside the frame as you
can<00:00:46.410> see<00:00:46.590> right<00:00:46.620> here<00:00:47.539> shows<00:00:48.539> you<00:00:49.700> that

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
can see right here shows you that

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.869 
can see right here shows you that
everything<00:00:51.690> it's<00:00:51.809> inside<00:00:52.230> the<00:00:52.260> frame<00:00:52.879> now

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
everything it's inside the frame now

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.529 
everything it's inside the frame now
what<00:00:54.300> I<00:00:54.329> did<00:00:54.629> is<00:00:54.780> that<00:00:54.809> even<00:00:55.590> if<00:00:55.770> you<00:00:55.890> can<00:00:56.070> see

00:00:56.529 --> 00:00:56.539 
what I did is that even if you can see

00:00:56.539 --> 00:01:02.750 
what I did is that even if you can see
in<00:00:57.539> between<00:00:58.020> here<00:01:00.739> the<00:01:01.739> cables<00:01:02.160> go<00:01:02.370> right<00:01:02.609> into

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
in between here the cables go right into

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:08.090 
in between here the cables go right into
the<00:01:03.030> power<00:01:03.239> board<00:01:04.220> and<00:01:05.220> then<00:01:06.560> the<00:01:07.560> power<00:01:07.799> board

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
the power board and then the power board

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.740 
the power board and then the power board
also<00:01:08.280> has<00:01:09.710> each<00:01:10.710> one<00:01:11.100> of<00:01:11.130> the<00:01:11.750> speed

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
also has each one of the speed

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.510 
also has each one of the speed
controllers<00:01:14.180> for<00:01:15.180> each<00:01:15.330> one<00:01:15.479> of<00:01:15.509> the<00:01:15.689> motors

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:16.520 
controllers for each one of the motors

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:18.740 
controllers for each one of the motors
provided<00:01:17.520> right<00:01:17.700> in<00:01:17.850> there<00:01:18.030> when<00:01:18.450> it<00:01:18.540> ran

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
provided right in there when it ran

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.109 
provided right in there when it ran
under<00:01:18.780> here<00:01:19.170> anyways<00:01:20.130> I<00:01:20.250> label<00:01:20.610> them<00:01:20.759> that<00:01:20.970> way

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
under here anyways I label them that way

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.149 
under here anyways I label them that way
I<00:01:21.150> I<00:01:21.630> would<00:01:22.080> be<00:01:22.200> able<00:01:22.350> to<00:01:22.590> know<00:01:22.740> which<00:01:22.770> one<00:01:23.130> goes

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
I I would be able to know which one goes

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:24.920 
I I would be able to know which one goes
to<00:01:23.340> which<00:01:23.610> motor<00:01:23.909> just<00:01:24.150> in<00:01:24.330> case<00:01:24.509> they<00:01:24.689> were<00:01:24.750> or

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
to which motor just in case they were or

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.969 
to which motor just in case they were or
not<00:01:26.689> it<00:01:27.689> was<00:01:27.840> a<00:01:27.900> little<00:01:28.229> challenging<00:01:28.439> putting

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
not it was a little challenging putting

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:32.590 
not it was a little challenging putting
the<00:01:29.070> stuff<00:01:29.280> together<00:01:29.490> because<00:01:30.030> he's<00:01:30.180> so<00:01:30.329> tight

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:32.600 
the stuff together because he's so tight

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:36.020 
the stuff together because he's so tight
what<00:01:33.600> I<00:01:33.630> think<00:01:33.840> is<00:01:34.079> going<00:01:34.140> to<00:01:34.320> be<00:01:34.380> okay<00:01:34.770> I<00:01:35.189> mean

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
what I think is going to be okay I mean

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.800 
what I think is going to be okay I mean
the<00:01:36.290> speed<00:01:37.290> controllers<00:01:37.799> are<00:01:37.920> 30<00:01:38.220> amps<00:01:38.689> and<00:01:39.689> I

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
the speed controllers are 30 amps and I

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.149 
the speed controllers are 30 amps and I
think<00:01:40.049> there<00:01:40.200> will<00:01:40.259> be<00:01:40.320> they'll<00:01:40.710> be<00:01:40.860> okay

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
think there will be they'll be okay

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:44.130 
think there will be they'll be okay
handling<00:01:41.759> the<00:01:41.880> more

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:44.140 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:48.640 

again<00:01:45.310> now<00:01:46.310> I<00:01:46.340> have<00:01:46.670> another<00:01:47.479> thing<00:01:48.140> to<00:01:48.290> finish

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:48.650 
again now I have another thing to finish

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:53.260 
again now I have another thing to finish
and<00:01:48.890> I'm<00:01:49.130> going<00:01:49.340> to<00:01:49.369> be<00:01:49.460> using<00:01:49.610> these<00:01:52.270> bullet

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:53.270 
and I'm going to be using these bullet

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:54.910 
and I'm going to be using these bullet
connectors<00:01:53.720> actually<00:01:54.200> put<00:01:54.530> it<00:01:54.619> right<00:01:54.740> in<00:01:54.830> my

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:54.920 
connectors actually put it right in my

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:59.130 
connectors actually put it right in my
hand<00:01:55.810> they're<00:01:56.810> gold-plated<00:01:57.140> and<00:01:57.619> there<00:01:57.830> for

00:01:59.130 --> 00:01:59.140 
hand they're gold-plated and there for

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:02.230 
hand they're gold-plated and there for
RC<00:02:00.140> projects<00:02:00.740> and<00:02:00.920> everything<00:02:01.850> I<00:02:01.909> picked<00:02:02.119> them

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:02.240 
RC projects and everything I picked them

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:06.850 
RC projects and everything I picked them
up<00:02:02.330> on<00:02:02.539> the<00:02:03.430> the<00:02:04.430> RC<00:02:05.090> store<00:02:05.360> now<00:02:06.350> each<00:02:06.590> one<00:02:06.830> of

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:06.860 
up on the the RC store now each one of

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:08.590 
up on the the RC store now each one of
these<00:02:07.039> what's<00:02:07.610> going<00:02:07.820> to<00:02:07.880> happen<00:02:08.209> is<00:02:08.330> that<00:02:08.450> is

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:08.600 
these what's going to happen is that is

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:13.509 
these what's going to happen is that is
going<00:02:08.780> to<00:02:08.840> go<00:02:10.330> to<00:02:11.330> match<00:02:11.569> each<00:02:12.310> one<00:02:13.310> of<00:02:13.340> these

00:02:13.509 --> 00:02:13.519 
going to go to match each one of these

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:18.160 
going to go to match each one of these
right<00:02:13.790> here<00:02:16.030> this<00:02:17.030> connectors<00:02:17.569> cost<00:02:17.900> me<00:02:18.050> about

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.170 
right here this connectors cost me about

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:21.910 
right here this connectors cost me about
30<00:02:18.560> walks<00:02:18.830> quite<00:02:19.700> expensive<00:02:20.590> considering<00:02:21.590> any

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:21.920 
30 walks quite expensive considering any

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:25.990 
30 walks quite expensive considering any
way<00:02:22.100> they<00:02:22.280> go<00:02:22.430> like<00:02:22.549> that<00:02:22.760> and<00:02:23.650> when<00:02:24.650> I<00:02:25.549> saw<00:02:25.850> her

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:26.000 
way they go like that and when I saw her

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.900 
way they go like that and when I saw her
them<00:02:26.180> they're<00:02:26.660> going<00:02:26.810> to<00:02:26.900> go<00:02:27.049> like<00:02:27.620> that<00:02:27.910> what

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:28.910 
them they're going to go like that what

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:31.000 
them they're going to go like that what
I'm<00:02:29.030> going<00:02:29.180> to<00:02:29.239> do<00:02:29.390> is<00:02:29.540> that<00:02:29.780> after<00:02:30.080> i<00:02:30.590> finished

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.010 
I'm going to do is that after i finished

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:32.199 
I'm going to do is that after i finished
each<00:02:31.160> one<00:02:31.400> of<00:02:31.430> them<00:02:31.580> i'm<00:02:31.730> going<00:02:31.760> to<00:02:31.940> put<00:02:32.090> the

00:02:32.199 --> 00:02:32.209 
each one of them i'm going to put the

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:34.690 
each one of them i'm going to put the
shrink<00:02:32.540> tubing<00:02:33.040> around<00:02:34.040> them<00:02:34.220> so<00:02:34.250> it's<00:02:34.549> going

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:34.700 
shrink tubing around them so it's going

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:39.460 
shrink tubing around them so it's going

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:24.079 
one goes on which what I'm going to try

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:26.770 
one goes on which what I'm going to try
to<00:03:24.109> keep<00:03:24.320> them<00:03:24.530> all<00:03:25.430> the<00:03:25.790> same<00:03:25.819> around<00:03:26.420> that

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:26.780 
to keep them all the same around that

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:31.120 
to keep them all the same around that
way<00:03:26.900> they<00:03:27.109> do<00:03:27.170> the<00:03:28.130> same<00:03:28.370> thing<00:03:28.810> hopefully<00:03:30.130> if

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:31.130 
way they do the same thing hopefully if

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:32.680 
way they do the same thing hopefully if
not<00:03:31.160> I'm<00:03:31.430> gonna<00:03:31.549> have<00:03:31.700> to<00:03:31.819> look<00:03:31.970> online<00:03:32.120> to<00:03:32.329> see

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:32.690 
not I'm gonna have to look online to see

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:35.110 
not I'm gonna have to look online to see
how<00:03:32.810> these<00:03:32.989> things<00:03:33.370> need<00:03:34.370> to<00:03:34.430> be<00:03:34.579> plugged<00:03:34.850> a

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:35.120 
how these things need to be plugged a

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:36.640 
how these things need to be plugged a
night<00:03:35.329> and<00:03:35.569> they're<00:03:35.810> all<00:03:35.930> black<00:03:36.230> so<00:03:36.560> I'm

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:36.650 
night and they're all black so I'm

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:39.069 
night and they're all black so I'm
thinking<00:03:37.069> that<00:03:37.420> it<00:03:38.420> doesn't<00:03:38.750> really<00:03:38.870> matter

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:39.079

myself<00:04:52.710> for<00:04:53.130> my<00:04:53.250> son<00:04:53.520> so<00:04:53.550> you<00:04:54.060> know<00:04:55.020> i'm

00:04:55.189 --> 00:04:55.199 
myself for my son so you know i'm

00:04:55.199 --> 00:04:57.439 
myself for my son so you know i'm
debating<00:04:55.949> whether<00:04:56.430> i<00:04:56.490> should<00:04:56.610> have<00:04:56.880> a<00:04:56.909> fuse<00:04:57.270> or

00:04:57.439 --> 00:04:57.449 
debating whether i should have a fuse or

00:04:57.449 --> 00:05:01.820 
debating whether i should have a fuse or
not<00:04:59.449> so<00:05:00.449> but<00:05:00.780> i<00:05:00.810> don't<00:05:01.080> know<00:05:01.110> i<00:05:01.289> need<00:05:01.440> to<00:05:01.590> read<00:05:01.800> a

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:01.830 
not so but i don't know i need to read a

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:05.629 
not so but i don't know i need to read a
little<00:05:02.070> bit<00:05:02.220> of<00:05:02.280> that<00:05:03.590> anyway<00:05:04.590> this<00:05:05.340> is<00:05:05.430> as<00:05:05.580> far

00:05:05.629 --> 00:05:05.639 
little bit of that anyway this is as far

00:05:05.639 --> 00:05:09.439 
little bit of that anyway this is as far
as<00:05:05.849> we've<00:05:06.030> gotten<00:05:06.060> on<00:05:06.449> this<00:05:06.630> thing<00:05:06.870> and<00:05:07.080> i<00:05:08.449> got

00:05:09.439 --> 00:05:09.449 
as we've gotten on this thing and i got

00:05:09.449 --> 00:05:14.659 
as we've gotten on this thing and i got
other<00:05:10.380> pieces<00:05:10.770> that<00:05:11.009> go<00:05:13.340> that<00:05:14.340> need<00:05:14.490> to<00:05:14.639> be

00:05:14.659 --> 00:05:14.669 
other pieces that go that need to be

00:05:14.669 --> 00:05:17.300 
other pieces that go that need to be
added<00:05:14.970> like<00:05:15.479> the<00:05:15.720> controller<00:05:16.139> that<00:05:16.919> is<00:05:16.979> going

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:17.310 
added like the controller that is going

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:22.960 
added like the controller that is going
to<00:05:17.400> grow<00:05:17.550> around<00:05:17.729> up<00:05:17.970> here<00:05:18.000> and<00:05:20.900> the<00:05:21.900> autopilot

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:22.970 
to grow around up here and the autopilot

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:26.960 
to grow around up here and the autopilot
so<00:05:23.970> what<00:05:24.659> I'm<00:05:24.780> thinking<00:05:24.810> is<00:05:25.289> that<00:05:25.669> like<00:05:26.669> still

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:26.970 
so what I'm thinking is that like still

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:30.010 
so what I'm thinking is that like still
have<00:05:27.740> you<00:05:28.740> were<00:05:28.860> saying<00:05:29.130> that<00:05:29.310> I<00:05:29.340> don't<00:05:29.610> have

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:30.020 
have you were saying that I don't have

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:32.749 
have you were saying that I don't have
enough<00:05:31.020> things<00:05:31.229> to<00:05:31.380> add<00:05:31.650> to<00:05:31.680> this<00:05:31.979> thing<00:05:32.250> but<00:05:32.520> I

00:05:32.749 --> 00:05:32.759 
enough things to add to this thing but I

00:05:32.759 --> 00:05:37.480 
enough things to add to this thing but I
got<00:05:33.509> the<00:05:33.690> receiver<00:05:34.289> I<00:05:34.880> have<00:05:35.880> the<00:05:36.030> autopilot<00:05:36.389> I

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:37.490 
got the receiver I have the autopilot I

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:43.070 
got the receiver I have the autopilot I
got<00:05:39.320> the<00:05:40.320> controller<00:05:40.740> would<00:05:41.039> i<00:05:41.900> still<00:05:42.900> have

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:43.080 
got the controller would i still have

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:48.640 
got the controller would i still have
the<00:05:43.110> leds<00:05:44.449> for<00:05:45.680> around

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:48.650 
the leds for around

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:55.340 
the leds for around
the<00:05:49.650> power<00:05:49.830> switch<00:05:50.130> right<00:05:50.880> here<00:05:52.940> so<00:05:54.230> you<00:05:55.230> know

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:55.350 
the power switch right here so you know

00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:59.890 
the power switch right here so you know
I<00:05:55.380> still<00:05:55.620> have<00:05:55.830> quite<00:05:56.160> a<00:05:56.220> bit<00:05:56.310> to<00:05:56.460> go<00:05:58.250> let<00:05:59.250> us

00:05:59.890 --> 00:05:59.900 
I still have quite a bit to go let us

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:02.270 
I still have quite a bit to go let us
get<00:06:00.900> somebody<00:06:01.260> sovereign<00:06:01.800> or<00:06:01.950> other<00:06:02.070> way

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:02.280 
get somebody sovereign or other way

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:06.260 
get somebody sovereign or other way
today<00:06:02.640> that<00:06:03.060> way<00:06:03.210> next<00:06:03.540> weekend<00:06:04.110> I<00:06:05.270> shoot

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:06.270 
today that way next weekend I shoot

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:09.020 
today that way next weekend I shoot
another<00:06:06.450> video<00:06:06.690> and<00:06:07.170> go<00:06:07.470> from<00:06:07.650> there<00:06:07.830> okay<00:06:08.760> I

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:09.030

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:15.050 
another video and go from there okay I
guess<00:06:09.990> until<00:06:10.410> until<00:06:11.340> then<00:06:11.580> and<00:06:11.610> I<00:06:13.820> mean<00:06:14.820> I<00:06:14.880> can

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:15.060 
guess until until then and I mean I can

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:17.450 
guess until until then and I mean I can
wait<00:06:15.210> to<00:06:15.360> get<00:06:15.450> this<00:06:15.630> thing<00:06:15.690> going<00:06:16.310> you<00:06:17.310> got<00:06:17.430> a

wait to get this thing going you got a
couple<00:06:17.550> of<00:06:17.790> weeks<00:06:18.000> and<00:06:18.240> she'll<00:06:19.020> be<00:06:19.110> done<00:06:19.290> with
