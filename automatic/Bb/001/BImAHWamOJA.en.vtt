00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.240
 So, let's go to São Paulo Cup. Who's the brand? 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:28.080
 first in the match between saints and 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.300
 criciúma 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:33.239
 will the fish leave the front not 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:36.149
 we will score goals in the game criciúma balance 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:37.980
 the network first and mauro you know neither 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:39.660
 always score the first goal of a 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.520
 departure means that you are going to 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.680
 to win you will look like the saints 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.539
 in fact started very well getting 8 to 0 of the 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.460
 Rosemary in the opening match in the cup 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:48.989
 São Paulo, but I understand that the 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.629
 Santos team is good and so the 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:52.920
 Santos will make the first goal of the 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.730
 match against santa's team 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.309
 Catherine 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.260
 newcastle manchester city face 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:00.420
 for we want to know what range 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.940
 the first goal of the game will leave 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:05.100
 are three options in the first step and 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.049
 three other options on the second 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:10.200
 addition you can dry the 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:13.020
 gunners and bet on 100 kicks and 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.659
 mauro when the first goal comes out in 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.970
 2000 kers or and manchester ciry in case 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:20.460
 makes a consistent campaign but this one 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.110
 new to veto better but I think 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.360
 that playing at home with this beautiful 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.640
 a good campaign that I think 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.680
 It could be I want, I'll take the 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.500
 first goal in the first 20 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.670
 minutes and already júlio kicking here was not 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.009
 Not to say but I think it's going to be good. 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:37.829
 do not want sound is a guess is not a 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:39.750
 possible game between the leaders and full 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:40.530
 to score the last goal of the 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.170
 match 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.770
 and then which one of you will you bet on? 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.189
 March 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:48.750
 who will score the last athletic goal 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:51.090
 from madrid and barcelona 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.979
 Look, I just know we have several goals. I'll go. 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.170
 until I feel we have five 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:57.180
 goals will be 3 to 2 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.549
 as far as I'm going to risk saying that the 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:02.040
 Brazilian who is now going to be 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:04.380
 in the cup of 2014 here in brazil the diego 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.610
 Coast for me will make the last goal of the 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.649
 spanish classic 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:10.200
 now just do not ask me how much it will be 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:12.209
 For who will be my 3 to 2 but to 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.930
 Me, the last goal will be the Brazilian's 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:15.810
 now 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:18.719
 el diego costa a mandatory question in the 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:20.489
 classic screen between porto and benfica that 

00:02:18.719 --> 00:02:22.799
 So who gets the best? 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:25.530
 options for three wins for both 

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:28.140
 sides and three draws to choose from 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:30.480
 options do not lack now just turn around and 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:33.810
 kick when is going to be a great classic 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:35.400
 a classic tribute to the 10 not only of 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:38.250
 embodied not only fans of the crowd 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:39.870
 but also from the port itself 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:41.790
 in the words of its president of his 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:44.189
 offers and even with immense rivalry 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:45.689
 which by almost all for the 

00:02:44.189 --> 00:02:47.370
 airport or rather the large 

00:02:45.689 --> 00:02:49.470
 achievements from the 80's 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:51.480
 from the port side, not by chance more than 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:53.459
 ten years later saw worked the 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:55.709
 great moment in European history 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:58.590
 world team of benfica but I think 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:03:00.239
 that the key by the astral by the will of 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:02.030
 beat the team of Benfica 

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:04.260
 to pay homage even more unforgettable 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:07.019
 Eusebius I understand that Benfica will 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:09.389
 win the port by the score of 1 to 0 goal 

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:12.810
 from the bottom up from the sky and from the 

00:03:09.389 --> 00:03:14.790
 eusébio good people were the guesses here 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:17.220
 in sporting it was a pleasure to play 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:18.840
