religious fanatic people which caused

religious fanatic people which caused
him<00:06:16.270> to<00:06:16.300> turn<00:06:16.570> away<00:06:16.750> from<00:06:16.840> God<00:06:17.110> and<00:06:17.590> then<00:06:17.830> kind

him to turn away from God and then kind

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:20.700 
him to turn away from God and then kind
-<00:06:18.310> it's<00:06:19.120> actually<00:06:19.630> one<00:06:19.810> of<00:06:19.840> the<00:06:20.020> key<00:06:20.200> points<00:06:20.410> of

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:20.710 
- it's actually one of the key points of

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:22.680 
- it's actually one of the key points of
Symphony<00:06:21.220> of<00:06:21.250> the<00:06:21.340> Night<00:06:21.430> story<00:06:21.910> -<00:06:22.150> so<00:06:22.480> it

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:22.690 
Symphony of the Night story - so it

00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:24.810 
Symphony of the Night story - so it
makes<00:06:22.930> a<00:06:23.050> lot<00:06:23.140> more<00:06:23.200> sense<00:06:23.380> then<00:06:23.860> perhaps<00:06:24.370> the

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:24.820 
makes a lot more sense then perhaps the

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:26.610 
makes a lot more sense then perhaps the
same<00:06:25.030> could<00:06:25.300> be<00:06:25.330> said<00:06:25.450> of<00:06:25.630> all<00:06:25.900> religions

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:26.620 
same could be said of all religions

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:28.800 
same could be said of all religions
which<00:06:27.340> sounds<00:06:27.940> as<00:06:28.030> if<00:06:28.150> Dracula<00:06:28.660> was<00:06:28.750> a

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:28.810 
which sounds as if Dracula was a

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:31.860 
which sounds as if Dracula was a
religion<00:06:29.320> or<00:06:29.470> something<00:06:29.980> but<00:06:30.910> I<00:06:31.210> definitely

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:31.870 
religion or something but I definitely

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:33.480 
religion or something but I definitely
agree<00:06:31.990> the<00:06:32.380> new<00:06:32.470> dub<00:06:32.710> is<00:06:32.920> not<00:06:33.100> nearly<00:06:33.340> as

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:33.490 
agree the new dub is not nearly as

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:35.640 
agree the new dub is not nearly as
memorable<00:06:33.850> as<00:06:34.120> the<00:06:34.300> original<00:06:34.780> it's<00:06:35.320> just<00:06:35.530> the

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:35.650 
memorable as the original it's just the

00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:37.650 
memorable as the original it's just the

00:07:23.490 --> 00:07:23.500 
think that the new dub is kind of good

00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:26.520 
think that the new dub is kind of good
instead<00:07:23.950> of<00:07:24.010> just<00:07:24.280> mediocre<00:07:24.720> all<00:07:25.720> in<00:07:25.990> all<00:07:26.140> no
