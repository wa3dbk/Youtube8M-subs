and<00:00:00.690> then<00:00:00.989> we<00:00:01.979> can<00:00:02.010> now<00:00:02.370> write<00:00:02.700> simple<00:00:03.210> r<00:00:03.689> 1<00:00:04.350> r<00:00:04.589> 2

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:05.480 
and then we can now write simple r 1 r 2

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:10.129 
and then we can now write simple r 1 r 2
i'm<00:00:06.480> open<00:00:06.870> a<00:00:06.899> bracket<00:00:07.230> again<00:00:07.680> cos<00:00:09.139> theta1

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:10.139 
i'm open a bracket again cos theta1

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:18.550 
i'm open a bracket again cos theta1
theta2<00:00:11.030> plus<00:00:12.980> i<00:00:13.980> sine<00:00:15.320> eat<00:00:16.320> the<00:00:16.529> 180<00:00:17.250> people<00:00:17.789> to

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:18.560 
theta2 plus i sine eat the 180 people to

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:23.570 
theta2 plus i sine eat the 180 people to
which<00:00:19.560> takes<00:00:20.070> the<00:00:20.220> form<00:00:20.820> s<00:00:21.380> the<00:00:22.380> polar<00:00:22.890> form

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
which takes the form s the polar form

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.490 
which takes the form s the polar form
here<00:00:23.760> take<00:00:23.970> the<00:00:24.090> form<00:00:24.269> of<00:00:24.359> the<00:00:24.510> polar<00:00:24.810> equation

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
here take the form of the polar equation

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.920 
here take the form of the polar equation
over<00:00:25.680> here<00:00:26.039> okay<00:00:26.970> so<00:00:27.420> we're<00:00:27.570> just<00:00:27.599> comparing

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
over here okay so we're just comparing

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.200 
over here okay so we're just comparing
this<00:00:28.170> with<00:00:28.230> this<00:00:28.590> notice<00:00:29.369> again<00:00:29.609> that<00:00:29.640> this<00:00:29.970> is

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
this with this notice again that this is

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.900 
this with this notice again that this is
maybe<00:00:30.480> 21<00:00:30.990> we<00:00:31.830> square<00:00:32.099> is<00:00:32.189> you<00:00:32.279> square<00:00:32.520> this<00:00:32.669> is

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
maybe 21 we square is you square this is

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.600 
maybe 21 we square is you square this is
maybe<00:00:33.420> 21<00:00:33.899> so<00:00:34.530> that<00:00:34.800> means<00:00:34.980> the<00:00:35.070> magnitude<00:00:35.460> is

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
maybe 21 so that means the magnitude is

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.160 
maybe 21 so that means the magnitude is
now<00:00:35.760> over<00:00:36.450> here<00:00:36.719> it<00:00:37.140> means<00:00:37.730> the<00:00:38.730> magnitude<00:00:39.300> all

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
now over here it means the magnitude all

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.680 
now over here it means the magnitude all
of<00:00:40.469> the<00:00:40.590> modulus<00:00:41.010> of<00:00:41.450> these<00:00:42.450> numbers

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
of the modulus of these numbers

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.160 
of the modulus of these numbers
multiplied<00:00:43.200> together<00:00:43.379> is<00:00:43.770> r1<00:00:44.280> r2<00:00:44.820> and<00:00:45.750> the

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
multiplied together is r1 r2 and the

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.990 
multiplied together is r1 r2 and the
argument<00:00:46.770> is<00:00:48.680> going<00:00:49.680> to<00:00:49.770> be<00:00:49.890> the<00:00:50.460> one<00:00:50.640> over

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
argument is going to be the one over

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.220 
argument is going to be the one over
here<00:00:51.270> either<00:00:52.170> one<00:00:53.010> and<00:00:53.309> a<00:00:53.340> little<00:00:53.940> too<00:00:54.480> just

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
here either one and a little too just

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.229 
here either one and a little too just
like<00:00:55.500> we<00:00:56.160> have<00:00:56.280> done<00:00:56.309> using<00:00:56.789> Euler's<00:00:57.210> formula

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
like we have done using Euler's formula

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.660 
like we have done using Euler's formula
but<00:00:57.690> this<00:00:57.870> case<00:00:58.079> we're<00:00:58.260> using<00:00:58.460> trigonometry<00:00:59.460> I

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
but this case we're using trigonometry I

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.240 
but this case we're using trigonometry I
get<00:00:59.940> this<00:01:00.149> in<00:01:00.329> particular<00:01:00.500> edition<00:01:01.500> formally

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
get this in particular edition formally

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.600 
get this in particular edition formally
okay<00:01:02.910> now<00:01:03.480> i<00:01:03.780> just<00:01:03.809> know<00:01:04.559> the<00:01:05.010> less<00:01:05.159> light<00:01:05.400> on

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
okay now i just know the less light on

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:10.730 
okay now i just know the less light on
this<00:01:06.860> to<00:01:07.860> the<00:01:08.070> logarithm<00:01:08.930> if<00:01:09.930> that's<00:01:10.260> a<00:01:10.470> way

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
this to the logarithm if that's a way

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.640 
this to the logarithm if that's a way
that<00:01:10.920> can<00:01:11.070> help<00:01:11.340> you<00:01:11.520> out<00:01:11.549> is<00:01:11.939> a<00:01:12.659> nebulous<00:01:13.350> to

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
that can help you out is a nebulous to

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:18.670 
that can help you out is a nebulous to
the<00:01:13.830> logarithm<00:01:14.640> over<00:01:15.030> here<00:01:15.240> which<00:01:15.600> is<00:01:16.460> yeah

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:18.680 
the logarithm over here which is yeah

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:23.179 
the logarithm over here which is yeah
sorry<00:01:19.680> okay<00:01:20.009> yeah<00:01:20.189> well<00:01:20.820> why<00:01:21.360> not<00:01:21.770> no<00:01:22.770> X<00:01:22.979> or<00:01:23.159> Y

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
sorry okay yeah well why not no X or Y

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.249 
sorry okay yeah well why not no X or Y
and<00:01:23.580> then<00:01:24.000> this<00:01:24.180> one<00:01:24.240> is<00:01:24.420> equal<00:01:24.990> to<00:01:25.110> this

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
and then this one is equal to this

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:28.370 
and then this one is equal to this
really<00:01:25.619> is<00:01:25.680> also<00:01:25.950> equal<00:01:26.400> to<00:01:26.670> argument<00:01:27.270> of<00:01:27.450> Z

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
really is also equal to argument of Z

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.789 
really is also equal to argument of Z
and<00:01:28.680> I<00:01:28.799> with<00:01:28.979> argument<00:01:29.610> of<00:01:29.990> W<00:01:30.990> it<00:01:31.350> just<00:01:31.590> write

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
and I with argument of W it just write

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:34.100 
and I with argument of W it just write
the<00:01:31.950> complete<00:01:32.220> no<00:01:32.579> one<00:01:32.729> over<00:01:32.820> here<00:01:33.119> okay<00:01:33.299> and

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
the complete no one over here okay and

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.440 
the complete no one over here okay and
then<00:01:34.409> we<00:01:34.619> have<00:01:34.860> it<00:01:35.040> proving<00:01:35.820> the<00:01:35.909> results

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
then we have it proving the results

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.560 
then we have it proving the results
without<00:01:36.750> using<00:01:37.290> Euler's<00:01:37.979> formula<00:01:38.570> quite

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
without using Euler's formula quite

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.690 
without using Euler's formula quite
interesting<00:01:40.079> and<00:01:40.350> is<00:01:40.950> there<00:01:41.159> anything<00:01:41.369> worth

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
interesting and is there anything worth

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:47.980 
interesting and is there anything worth
noting<00:01:42.030> yes<00:01:42.409> this<00:01:43.409> one<00:01:43.619> is<00:01:45.710> equals<00:01:46.710> to<00:01:46.770> r<00:01:47.100> 1<00:01:47.130> r<00:01:47.579> 2

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:47.990 
noting yes this one is equals to r 1 r 2

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:50.870 
noting yes this one is equals to r 1 r 2
similarly<00:01:48.990> you<00:01:49.350> can<00:01:49.530> try<00:01:50.040> it<00:01:50.100> out<00:01:50.310> this<00:01:50.670> one

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
similarly you can try it out this one

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.870 
similarly you can try it out this one
yourself<00:01:51.320> which<00:01:52.320> is<00:01:52.409> equals<00:01:52.770> to<00:01:52.829> r<00:01:53.130> 1<00:01:53.159> pick

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
yourself which is equals to r 1 pick

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.499 
yourself which is equals to r 1 pick
away<00:01:54.119> are<00:01:54.450> to<00:01:55.049> you<00:01:55.590> just<00:01:55.829> substitute<00:01:56.399> the<00:01:57.060> idea

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
away are to you just substitute the idea

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.569 
away are to you just substitute the idea
the<00:01:57.689> identity<00:01:58.320> that<00:01:58.350> we've<00:01:58.649> used<00:01:58.860> previously

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
the identity that we've used previously

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:02.450 
the identity that we've used previously
is<00:02:00.090> that<00:02:00.360> it<00:02:00.630> goes<00:02:00.810> like<00:02:00.990> their<00:02:01.170> conjugate<00:02:01.770> z

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
is that it goes like their conjugate z

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.240 
is that it goes like their conjugate z
square<00:02:02.820> okay<00:02:03.509> so<00:02:03.960> basically<00:02:04.170> i'm<00:02:04.860> not<00:02:05.130> going

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
square okay so basically i'm not going

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:06.380 
square okay so basically i'm not going
to<00:02:05.310> do<00:02:05.369> the<00:02:05.460> whole<00:02:05.670> thing<00:02:05.700> you<00:02:05.909> can<00:02:06.030> go<00:02:06.119> try<00:02:06.360> it

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
to do the whole thing you can go try it

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.690 
to do the whole thing you can go try it
out<00:02:06.540> the<00:02:06.869> r2<00:02:07.320> will<00:02:07.469> be<00:02:07.500> come<00:02:07.799> over<00:02:08.369> here<00:02:08.550> at<00:02:08.610> the

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
out the r2 will be come over here at the

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:09.040 
out the r2 will be come over here at the
bar

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:09.050 
bar

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:12.010 
bar
over<00:02:09.260> like<00:02:09.380> that<00:02:09.590> and<00:02:09.890> then<00:02:10.750> because<00:02:11.750> of<00:02:11.930> the

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:12.020 
over like that and then because of the

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:13.780 
over like that and then because of the
conjugate<00:02:12.290> this<00:02:13.070> one<00:02:13.280> is<00:02:13.400> going<00:02:13.580> to<00:02:13.640> be<00:02:13.760> a

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:13.790 
conjugate this one is going to be a

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:15.580 
conjugate this one is going to be a
minus<00:02:14.060> here<00:02:14.210> something<00:02:15.170> is<00:02:15.260> going<00:02:15.410> to<00:02:15.500> be<00:02:15.560> a

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 
minus here something is going to be a

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:18.670 
minus here something is going to be a
minus<00:02:15.800> here<00:02:16.630> that<00:02:17.630> means<00:02:17.840> when<00:02:18.140> we<00:02:18.290> go<00:02:18.440> here

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 
minus here that means when we go here

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.640 
minus here that means when we go here
you<00:02:19.010> go<00:02:19.520> baby<00:02:19.790> go<00:02:19.880> from<00:02:20.060> here<00:02:20.210> to<00:02:20.270> here<00:02:20.650> it

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
you go baby go from here to here it

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:24.160 
you go baby go from here to here it
becomes<00:02:22.040> a<00:02:22.190> minus<00:02:22.370> like<00:02:23.060> that<00:02:23.240> it<00:02:24.020> had

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:24.170 
becomes a minus like that it had

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:26.140 
becomes a minus like that it had
procured<00:02:24.500> here<00:02:24.830> and<00:02:25.070> computer<00:02:25.520> here<00:02:25.670> I<00:02:25.700> side

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150 
procured here and computer here I side

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:29.350 
procured here and computer here I side
so<00:02:26.570> this<00:02:26.720> becomes<00:02:27.020> a<00:02:27.170> plus<00:02:27.470> I<00:02:27.770> times<00:02:28.430> I<00:02:28.670> becomes

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:29.360 
so this becomes a plus I times I becomes

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:31.510 
so this becomes a plus I times I becomes
negative<00:02:29.690> they<00:02:30.020> times<00:02:30.470> x<00:02:30.650> minus<00:02:30.890> you<00:02:31.160> get<00:02:31.310> plus

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:31.520 
negative they times x minus you get plus

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:33.610 
negative they times x minus you get plus
and<00:02:31.820> just<00:02:32.240> do<00:02:32.390> it<00:02:32.480> accordingly<00:02:32.960> you<00:02:33.410> should

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:33.620 
and just do it accordingly you should

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:39.460 
and just do it accordingly you should
get<00:02:33.890> this<00:02:34.820> one<00:02:35.030> over<00:02:35.060> here<00:02:35.270> argument<00:02:36.760> Z<00:02:38.470> equals

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:39.470 
get this one over here argument Z equals

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:45.850 
get this one over here argument Z equals
