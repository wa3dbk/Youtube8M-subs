00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:04.860 
actually clear so it kind of works even
though<00:03:03.220> it's<00:03:03.340> huge<00:03:03.579> and<00:03:03.670> chunky<00:03:04.060> I<00:03:04.269> just<00:03:04.720> like

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:04.870 
though it's huge and chunky I just like

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:06.210 
though it's huge and chunky I just like
the<00:03:04.959> way<00:03:04.989> that<00:03:05.260> a<00:03:05.439> statement<00:03:05.680> necklace<00:03:06.040> can

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:06.220 
the way that a statement necklace can

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:08.069 
the way that a statement necklace can
really<00:03:06.430> bring<00:03:06.640> together<00:03:06.849> your<00:03:07.599> outfit<00:03:07.870> when

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:08.079 
really bring together your outfit when

00:03:08.079 --> 00:03:09.780 
really bring together your outfit when
you<00:03:08.170> have<00:03:08.319> the<00:03:08.500> collar<00:03:08.709> all<00:03:09.010> done<00:03:09.189> up<00:03:09.220> and<00:03:09.459> I

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:09.790 
you have the collar all done up and I

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:14.390 
you have the collar all done up and I
think<00:03:09.939> it<00:03:10.030> just<00:03:10.060> looks<00:03:10.269> really<00:03:10.390> super<00:03:10.840> cool

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:17.039 

this<00:03:15.400> is<00:03:15.519> another<00:03:15.730> example<00:03:15.849> of<00:03:16.299> that<00:03:16.359> but<00:03:16.870> this

00:03:17.039 --> 00:03:17.049 
this is another example of that but this

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:19.619 
this is another example of that but this
time<00:03:17.230> I<00:03:17.440> went<00:03:17.620> with<00:03:17.769> a<00:03:17.799> huge<00:03:18.159> color<00:03:18.790> pop<00:03:19.120> but

00:03:19.619 --> 00:03:19.629 
time I went with a huge color pop but

00:03:19.629 --> 00:03:21.270 
time I went with a huge color pop but
it's<00:03:19.959> actually<00:03:20.170> a<00:03:20.349> very<00:03:20.500> plain<00:03:20.920> statement

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:21.280 
it's actually a very plain statement

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:23.699 
it's actually a very plain statement
necklace<00:03:21.609> so<00:03:21.909> it<00:03:22.480> looks<00:03:22.659> okay<00:03:22.959> with<00:03:23.139> it<00:03:23.290> and<00:03:23.470> I

00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:23.709 
necklace so it looks okay with it and I

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:24.660 
necklace so it looks okay with it and I
think<00:03:23.769> the<00:03:23.950> color<00:03:24.159> is<00:03:24.220> go<00:03:24.400> really<00:03:24.549> nicely

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:24.670 
think the color is go really nicely

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:29.490 
think the color is go really nicely
together<00:03:26.549> and<00:03:27.629> for<00:03:28.629> the<00:03:28.689> last<00:03:28.870> of<00:03:29.079> it<00:03:29.260> this<00:03:29.439> is

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:29.500 
together and for the last of it this is

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:31.890 
together and for the last of it this is
a<00:03:29.620> very<00:03:29.799> casual<00:03:30.370> go<00:03:30.639> to<00:03:30.700> outfit<00:03:31.209> especially<00:03:31.750> in

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:31.900 
a very casual go to outfit especially in

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:33.990 
a very casual go to outfit especially in
the<00:03:32.109> summer<00:03:32.379> months<00:03:32.590> but<00:03:33.310> I<00:03:33.370> am<00:03:33.519> wearing<00:03:33.730> a

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:34.000 
the summer months but I am wearing a

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.819

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:35.829 
pair of pants with it but I found that

00:03:35.829 --> 00:03:37.890 
pair of pants with it but I found that
it<00:03:36.040> was<00:03:36.069> very<00:03:36.340> neutral<00:03:36.760> and<00:03:36.970> the<00:03:37.359> middle<00:03:37.720> just

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:37.900 
it was very neutral and the middle just

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:39.539 
it was very neutral and the middle just
really<00:03:38.260> needed<00:03:38.470> something<00:03:38.590> so<00:03:39.370> when<00:03:39.459> you're
