00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
address you can also just say tube

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.570 
address you can also just say tube
and<00:02:06.090> that<00:02:06.689> will<00:02:06.869> definitely<00:02:07.680> block<00:02:08.250> YouTube

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580

and that will definitely block YouTube
so<00:02:09.300> it's<00:02:09.479> a<00:02:09.539> matter<00:02:09.720> of<00:02:10.700> how<00:02:12.980> granular<00:02:13.980> you

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:14.550 
so it's a matter of how granular you

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:19.750 
so it's a matter of how granular you
really<00:02:15.209> want<00:02:15.390> to<00:02:15.510> be<00:02:15.660> it's<00:02:15.810> very<00:02:15.930> adjustable

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:19.760 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:24.009 

so<00:02:20.760> that<00:02:21.120> is<00:02:21.390> kind<00:02:21.870> of<00:02:21.959> an<00:02:22.080> overview<00:02:22.200> and

00:02:24.009 --> 00:02:24.019 
so that is kind of an overview and

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:27.110 
so that is kind of an overview and
that's<00:02:25.019> a<00:02:25.230> good<00:02:25.440> quick<00:02:26.160> store<00:02:26.459> tutorial<00:02:27.000> on

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120
