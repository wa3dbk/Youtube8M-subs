00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:45.570 
spend 250 specifically for gaming or

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:48.229 
spend 250 specifically for gaming or
like<00:02:45.870> 170<00:02:46.470> for<00:02:46.590> the<00:02:46.709> ax<00:02:46.980> bros<00:02:47.310> definitely<00:02:48.150> go

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:48.239 
like 170 for the ax bros definitely go

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:52.040 
like 170 for the ax bros definitely go
for<00:02:48.300> the<00:02:48.480> x-force<00:02:48.900> the<00:02:49.830> x<00:02:50.040> 40<00:02:50.790> ones<00:02:51.030> I<00:02:51.390> wouldn't

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:52.050 
for the x-force the x 40 ones I wouldn't

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:53.810 
for the x-force the x 40 ones I wouldn't
I<00:02:52.650> wouldn't<00:02:52.800> recommend<00:02:53.280> getting<00:02:53.550> them

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:53.820 
I wouldn't recommend getting them

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:57.340 
I wouldn't recommend getting them
because<00:02:54.450> the<00:02:54.660> RF<00:02:55.320> signal<00:02:55.830> is<00:02:56.040> a<00:02:56.239> inter

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:57.350 
because the RF signal is a inter

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:59.690 
because the RF signal is a inter
interferes<00:02:58.350> with<00:02:58.680> a<00:02:58.709> lot<00:02:58.980> of<00:02:59.010> stuff<00:02:59.310> like<00:02:59.519> the

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
interferes with a lot of stuff like the

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:02.120 
interferes with a lot of stuff like the
e<00:02:59.730> router<00:03:00.060> and<00:03:00.540> with<00:03:01.260> the<00:03:01.380> controllers<00:03:01.980> and

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:02.130 
e router and with the controllers and

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:03.470 
e router and with the controllers and
stuff<00:03:02.340> and<00:03:02.610> you'll<00:03:02.730> get<00:03:02.910> like<00:03:03.090> a<00:03:03.120> hissing

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
stuff and you'll get like a hissing

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:06.979 
stuff and you'll get like a hissing
noise<00:03:04.070> also<00:03:05.070> the<00:03:05.340> the<00:03:05.730> 7.1<00:03:06.480> it's<00:03:06.630> not<00:03:06.810> really

00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:06.989 
noise also the the 7.1 it's not really

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:09.650 
noise also the the 7.1 it's not really
7.1<00:03:07.680> because<00:03:08.100> even<00:03:08.730> though<00:03:08.850> it<00:03:09.000> has<00:03:09.120> the<00:03:09.360> chip

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:09.660 
7.1 because even though it has the chip

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:12.770 
7.1 because even though it has the chip
inside<00:03:10.019> 47.1<00:03:10.769> the<00:03:11.459> optical<00:03:12.120> cable<00:03:12.480> cannot

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
inside 47.1 the optical cable cannot

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:16.040 
inside 47.1 the optical cable cannot
transmit<00:03:13.200> 7.1<00:03:13.950> it<00:03:14.070> can<00:03:14.190> only<00:03:14.280> go<00:03:14.519> up<00:03:14.550> to<00:03:14.790> 6.1<00:03:15.450> so

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:16.050 
transmit 7.1 it can only go up to 6.1 so

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:18.170 
transmit 7.1 it can only go up to 6.1 so
it's<00:03:16.290> just<00:03:16.530> a<00:03:16.650> marketing<00:03:16.980> gimmick<00:03:17.280> so<00:03:17.700> don't

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
it's just a marketing gimmick so don't

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:22.460 
it's just a marketing gimmick so don't
be<00:03:18.269> fooled<00:03:18.510> by<00:03:18.570> that<00:03:19.910> now<00:03:20.910> the<00:03:20.970> the<00:03:21.540> Astros<00:03:22.019> are

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
be fooled by that now the the Astros are

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:24.979 
be fooled by that now the the Astros are
250<00:03:23.040> but<00:03:23.760> it's<00:03:23.970> really<00:03:24.329> too<00:03:24.450> worth<00:03:24.630> it<00:03:24.840> if

00:03:24.979 --> 00:03:24.989 
250 but it's really too worth it if

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:26.539 
250 but it's really too worth it if
you're<00:03:25.110> going<00:03:25.230> to<00:03:25.290> use<00:03:25.500> it<00:03:25.709> for<00:03:25.739> competitive

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000 
between out like 170 probably wouldn't

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.670 
between out like 170 probably wouldn't
recommend<00:03:51.390> getting<00:03:51.510> them<00:03:51.810> specifically<00:03:52.410> just

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:52.680 
recommend getting them specifically just

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:54.650 
recommend getting them specifically just
because<00:03:52.920> the<00:03:53.100> mic<00:03:53.280> breaks<00:03:53.549> law<00:03:53.850> and<00:03:54.120> you<00:03:54.540> can

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:54.660 
because the mic breaks law and you can

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:56.120 
because the mic breaks law and you can
have<00:03:54.810> a<00:03:54.840> lot<00:03:55.019> of<00:03:55.049> problems<00:03:55.380> with<00:03:55.410> that<00:03:55.620> and<00:03:55.829> it

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:56.130 
have a lot of problems with that and it

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:57.860 
have a lot of problems with that and it
really<00:03:56.370> pissed<00:03:56.610> me<00:03:56.730> off<00:03:56.820> and<00:03:57.000> I<00:03:57.329> know<00:03:57.390> probably

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:57.870 
really pissed me off and I know probably

00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:59.509 
really pissed me off and I know probably
piss<00:03:58.110> you<00:03:58.230> guys<00:03:58.290> off<00:03:58.500> also<00:03:58.920> and<00:03:59.340> then<00:03:59.459> I

crazy next ones are still very good for

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:13.069 
crazy next ones are still very good for
60<00:04:11.220> bucks<00:04:11.430> keep<00:04:11.730> them<00:04:11.910> for<00:04:12.060> a<00:04:12.120> year<00:04:12.180> see<00:04:12.900> if<00:04:12.989> you

60 bucks keep them for a year see if you

competitive play by for the Astros

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:25.190 
competitive play by for the Astros
because<00:04:23.010> they're<00:04:23.479> designed<00:04:24.479> specifically

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:25.200

for competitive
I<00:04:26.320> the<00:04:26.920> x-force<00:04:27.340> can<00:04:27.580> be<00:04:27.730> used<00:04:27.910> at<00:04:28.060> MLG<00:04:28.360> events

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:28.810 
I the x-force can be used at MLG events

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:32.610 
I the x-force can be used at MLG events
or<00:04:29.020> at<00:04:29.260> lens<00:04:29.590> the<00:04:30.430> x1's<00:04:30.910> can<00:04:31.210> but<00:04:31.620> you're

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:32.620 
or at lens the x1's can but you're

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:33.930 
or at lens the x1's can but you're
probably<00:04:32.860> it<00:04:33.190> doesn't<00:04:33.460> really<00:04:33.550> matter<00:04:33.760> you

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:33.940 
probably it doesn't really matter you

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:36.150 
probably it doesn't really matter you
can<00:04:34.120> use<00:04:34.240> X<00:04:34.450> ones<00:04:34.660> if<00:04:34.780> you<00:04:34.870> want<00:04:35.050> and<00:04:35.230> the<00:04:35.830> ax

can use X ones if you want and the ax

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:38.820 
can use X ones if you want and the ax
pro<00:04:36.400> is<00:04:36.460> also<00:04:36.820> can<00:04:37.030> but<00:04:37.360> I<00:04:38.050> would<00:04:38.650> read

pointing out there is exposed wiring and

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:04.620 
pointing out there is exposed wiring and
you<00:05:03.580> don't<00:05:03.760> want<00:05:03.880> to<00:05:03.940> have<00:05:04.060> that<00:05:04.090> exposed

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:06.220 
wiring but besides that it feels very

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:09.870 
wiring but besides that it feels very
sturdy<00:05:06.520> and<00:05:06.810> I<00:05:07.810> really<00:05:08.710> it's<00:05:08.890> really<00:05:09.250> a<00:05:09.280> like

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:09.880 
sturdy and I really it's really a like

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:12.960 
sturdy and I really it's really a like
the<00:05:10.320> the<00:05:11.320> nails<00:05:11.860> are<00:05:12.130> in<00:05:12.310> good<00:05:12.580> everything's

good<00:05:13.060> feels<00:05:13.870> sturdy<00:05:14.170> and<00:05:14.500> the<00:05:14.650> mix<00:05:14.860> tip<00:05:15.010> is

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:15.130 
good feels sturdy and the mix tip is

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:17.730 
good feels sturdy and the mix tip is
also<00:05:15.460> pretty<00:05:15.610> sturdy<00:05:15.850> so<00:05:16.150> it's<00:05:16.270> good<00:05:16.740> yo

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:17.740 
also pretty sturdy so it's good yo

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:20.340 
also pretty sturdy so it's good yo
that's<00:05:18.730> 11th<00:05:19.420> probably<00:05:19.750> don't<00:05:19.870> have<00:05:19.960> the<00:05:20.140> best

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:20.350 
that's 11th probably don't have the best
