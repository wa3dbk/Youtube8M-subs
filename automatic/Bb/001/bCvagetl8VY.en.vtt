00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:09.810
 this is the day power month pm 11 02 h 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:14.220
 a heavy cane 

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:16.150
 tve but they are rather m 

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:19.390
 as you see here 

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:21.369
 is the code pm 11 02 h efe 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:22.990
 330 in length and you have seen in the 

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:25.000
 blog some more data but not 

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:28.260
 we wanted a video 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:31.890
 the cb 14 56 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:35.230
 It is very good two sections 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:39.010
 169 meters in length are two sections 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:42.790
 same let's start with parts 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:45.280
 it's very good that it 's pretty enough 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:47.470
 quality and peels a little 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:50.620
 It is obviously a stratum cane 

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:54.519
 economic medium low but it is a support 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:56.350
 fuji gps as you see is of these that go 

00:00:54.519 --> 00:00:59.699
 in castrated on the outside of the 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:59.699
 grip as it is very good 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:04.790
 very good very good ideas known but 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:07.190
 very good for this street is still here here 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:07.700
 it starts a little bit but it takes a 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:11.090
 detail 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:14.610
 this is gum rubber is not well 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:17.700
 have left the rise to surfaces 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:20.280
 and let him go and the riff ends 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.600
 with a sufficient distance from the tube 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:26.939
 big Brother 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:28.680
 and occupies everything in the heel a cap of 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:30.509
 rubber is also plastic but good 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:33.210
 I'm glad you have it because this 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:36.950
 it means that it will last us long 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.950
 let's continue to see a little details 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:45.850
 The rings are perfect are those 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:49.120
 they carry out double axes I do not know if it's 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:51.700
 30 do not leave your number of rings on 

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:55.710
 dark east of the schalke but it's very 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:02:00.409
 well those who have agreed this 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:00.409
 some detail and the rest are 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:08.560
 the sele also 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:08.560
 and those of the GDP have two casualties 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:11.069
 two 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:23.319
 that is 123 400 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:26.709
 7 18 8 rings 

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:30.629
 a plug as you see is pivot with a lot 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:30.629
 a lot of expansion margin 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:36.560
 a correct assembly 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:39.050
 a rope the distance between 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:41.900
 rings is a somewhat heavy rod past 

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:45.950
 the 300 grams for a good m is 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:47.700
 ok but a little less than 280 270 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:49.590
 grams would be much better 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:52.879
 a little bit 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:55.560
 I would like it to be a little 

00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:58.739
 decompensated the reed the reed that pulls 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:00.980
 of the arm not much holds up well but 

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:00.980
 we go 

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:06.530
 It is a rod that 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:08.930
 I've seen it out there, I bought it too 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:11.870
 a very good price for 85 euros is a 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:14.700
 very good price the truth not only of 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:16.050
 prices but fix 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:17.879
 that is a little bit in the 

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:19.900
 market like this is little by little 

00:03:17.879 --> 00:03:23.379
 with this trip 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:26.799
 very good condition works very well you can 

00:03:23.379 --> 00:03:28.989
 handle less than 15 grams until links 

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:30.840
 of almost 60 grams will not force us more than 

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:34.569
 60 grams is being updated vinyls 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:38.470
 255 grams and the spear is perfect 

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:40.900
 if it is handled very easily there are no 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:43.840
 rings are perfect because they do not avoid 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:46.590
 pretty extortions the braided 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:46.590
 and nothing more 

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:51.060
 see you later
