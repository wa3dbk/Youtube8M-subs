 as it is a sharing it is an exchange 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:22.520
 I like to mix currents 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:24.770
 different musicals and nothing like 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:25.880
 to make duets with 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:27.380
 foreign artists 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:29.509

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:30.590

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:36.200
 strong fame legrand fally ipupa that has 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:37.640

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:39.679
 agreed to sing on the cobos title 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:41.090
 matured I was lucky there are some 

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:42.860
 women also like islands is it on 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:44.240
 the title my rival is still my 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:45.830
 first gold record so that's the kind 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:48.440

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:49.490
 full of shoes with this book 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:52.250

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:53.240
 allowed to have this golden record there has been 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:54.619

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:57.140
 man-woman second gold disc with 

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:59.270
 with 10 so I have a lot I 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:00.560
 have plenty and it actually enriches to do 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:02.479
 duets with people because 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:03.619
 necessarily singing in duet you 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:05.240
 want to give the best of you 

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:07.520
 even you want to outdo yourself 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:09.259
 and then it gives songs rather 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:11.619
 friendly in the end frankly are 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:11.619
 audit 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:20.019
 now could you explain to us 

00:02:17.409 --> 00:02:23.260
 why this title I want you to lie 

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:26.110
 how can a normal woman 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:27.430
 desire that this title was proposed to me 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:28.720
 by singuila on my third album 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:30.700
 she and I 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:32.739
 when it was proposed to me I did but 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:34.120
 it's a guitar, it's not going to be me 

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:36.430
 I want to increase the opposite I 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:38.709
 preach the truth you are crazy and we have 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:40.299
 discussed a lot and explain to me who 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:41.950
 talked a lot with women and 

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:43.840
 somewhere it's true maybe we 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:45.549
 look for lies but wait 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:47.290
 when we talk about lies 

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:49.030
 we do not ask whoever we 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:50.500
 like to tell me that you love me then that 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:53.109
 you do not like me that does not interest me 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:55.660

00:02:53.109 --> 00:02:58.000

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:59.769

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:03.129
 kind of little lies I example 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:04.959

00:03:03.129 --> 00:03:07.480
 I gained weight and my husband saw me 

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:08.859

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:11.170

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:15.579
 on the fields elysées is a beautiful 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:17.290
 black woman like go noémie example 

00:03:15.579 --> 00:03:19.030
 lenoir goes and here it can be 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:21.099
 drop who are you doing what there 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:22.329
 we cherish you have seen you have seen but 

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:24.669
 you the most beautiful women 

00:03:22.329 --> 00:03:26.230
 so these are lies certainly me 

00:03:24.669 --> 00:03:27.639
 little lies and lies 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:29.919
 who do so much good 

00:03:27.639 --> 00:03:32.109
 you understood the street to really not 

00:03:29.919 --> 00:03:34.150
 wrong and it may be wearing his 

00:03:32.109 --> 00:03:37.030
 lies there that we are so addicted 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:39.490
 that's wrong 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:41.910
 he 

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:41.910
 herself 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:51.280
 now here years taken in the 

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:53.260
 backstage of the price is the scream it's 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:54.400
 true that the price she screams is a title 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:57.040
 which is very important to me 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:58.030
 so he came out in 4th single on my 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:59.080
 album is me on my 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:01.480
 birthday on January 4th this is 

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:03.610
 important to me and she prescribes 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:04.600
 talk about a true story and that's for 

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:05.050
 all those women who are suffering in 

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:06.819
 silence 

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:08.830
 I wanted to talk about the subject of 

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:10.600
 domestic violence that is almost taboo 

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:12.489
 is actually for me it's a subject of which 

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:13.540
 we have to talk and I wanted all 

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:15.459
 these women who are suffering in silence 

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:17.290
 know that they are not the only ones 

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:19.630
 have gone through that kind of experience and 

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:21.070
 that there is always a solution and that has 

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:21.370
 as we say after the rain the beautiful 

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:23.770
 time 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:25.240
 so it's true that in this piece I 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:27.640
 not only talk of domestic violence 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:29.740
 I also talk about the fact that sometimes 

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:31.419
 love we forget ourselves we accept even 

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:33.340
 the unacceptable one is moving away from his 

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:35.169
 family of his friends while this is the 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:36.700
 more important in life and sometimes 

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:39.070
 even though we feel so much is alone and 

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:41.979
 that we commit to the irreparable it is 

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:43.960
 to say kill yourself and so in this 

00:04:41.979 --> 00:04:47.139
 in his song I really wanted 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:48.700
 that it is a message of hope and 

00:04:47.139 --> 00:04:50.080
 themes a testimony for all these 

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:52.080
 women 

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:52.080
 1 

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:58.220
 we leave but do not want me 

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:58.760
 goes away very quickly we finish in notes of 

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:03.950
 music 

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:06.889
 if I go away especially do not miss 

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:10.419
 I am the one who you are but who was 

00:05:06.889 --> 00:05:12.919
 arms do not miss it's a bad 

00:05:10.419 --> 00:05:16.820
 necessary 

00:05:12.919 --> 00:05:20.990
 do not blame me you'll be in my 

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:21.760
 dreams in my prayers always there at the 

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:24.260
