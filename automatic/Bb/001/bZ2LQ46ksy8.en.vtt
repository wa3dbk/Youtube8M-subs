so<00:00:04.210> now<00:00:04.390> I'm<00:00:04.510> going<00:00:04.720> to<00:00:04.780> show<00:00:04.990> you<00:00:05.020> a<00:00:05.200> few<00:00:05.530> of

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:05.560 
so now I'm going to show you a few of

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:07.050 
so now I'm going to show you a few of
the<00:00:05.650> most<00:00:05.800> common<00:00:05.920> things<00:00:06.490> that<00:00:06.700> can<00:00:06.880> happen

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:07.060 
the most common things that can happen

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:09.569 
the most common things that can happen
when<00:00:07.360> exporting<00:00:07.990> with<00:00:08.170> FBX<00:00:08.679> to<00:00:08.889> unreal<00:00:09.280> for

00:00:09.569 --> 00:00:09.579 
when exporting with FBX to unreal for

00:00:09.579 --> 00:00:11.520 
when exporting with FBX to unreal for
the<00:00:09.639> first<00:00:09.849> time<00:00:10.119> and<00:00:10.389> of<00:00:10.900> course<00:00:11.169> how<00:00:11.499> to

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:11.530 
the first time and of course how to

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:13.949 
the first time and of course how to
avoid<00:00:11.980> these<00:00:12.219> things<00:00:12.549> in<00:00:12.700> the<00:00:12.789> future<00:00:12.940> so<00:00:13.929> I

00:00:13.949 --> 00:00:13.959 
avoid these things in the future so I

00:00:13.959 --> 00:00:15.989 
avoid these things in the future so I
have<00:00:14.169> this<00:00:14.289> old<00:00:14.559> West<00:00:14.860> saloon<00:00:15.159> model<00:00:15.519> that<00:00:15.849> I'd

00:00:15.989 --> 00:00:15.999 
have this old West saloon model that I'd

00:00:15.999 --> 00:00:18.480 
have this old West saloon model that I'd
like<00:00:16.150> to<00:00:16.180> bring<00:00:16.420> into<00:00:16.689> my<00:00:16.720> game<00:00:17.019> level<00:00:17.380> from<00:00:18.369> my

like to bring into my game level from my
unreal<00:00:18.849> game<00:00:19.119> level<00:00:19.480> I've<00:00:19.660> chosen<00:00:20.230> to

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:20.470 
unreal game level I've chosen to

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:22.859 
unreal game level I've chosen to
repurpose<00:00:20.800> the<00:00:21.189> slightly<00:00:21.580> older<00:00:21.730> 3ds<00:00:22.390> model

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:22.869 
repurpose the slightly older 3ds model

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:24.300 
repurpose the slightly older 3ds model
which<00:00:23.349> exhibits<00:00:23.859> many<00:00:24.009> of<00:00:24.160> the<00:00:24.250> classic

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:24.310 
which exhibits many of the classic

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:27.210 
which exhibits many of the classic
issues<00:00:25.000> that<00:00:25.269> modelers<00:00:25.630> go<00:00:25.839> through<00:00:26.099> with<00:00:27.099> the

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:27.220 
issues that modelers go through with the

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:29.070 
issues that modelers go through with the

notice right away that we have some

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:32.520 
notice right away that we have some
problems<00:00:30.789> and<00:00:30.970> these<00:00:31.630> are<00:00:31.779> perfectly<00:00:32.200> common

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:32.530 
problems and these are perfectly common

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:34.290 
problems and these are perfectly common
of<00:00:32.619> free<00:00:32.860> models<00:00:33.220> that<00:00:33.400> many<00:00:33.580> like<00:00:33.790> to<00:00:33.910> use<00:00:34.030> for

these<00:00:46.270> issues<00:00:46.660> can<00:00:46.870> also<00:00:46.930> reflect<00:00:47.380> many<00:00:47.740> other

model in a different 3d program or

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:54.930

perhaps<00:00:53.320> you're<00:00:53.650> still<00:00:53.890> relatively<00:00:54.610> new<00:00:54.760> to

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:54.940 
perhaps you're still relatively new to

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:58.320 
perhaps you're still relatively new to
3d<00:00:55.480> modeling<00:00:56.070> so<00:00:57.070> if<00:00:57.370> we<00:00:57.550> try<00:00:57.820> to<00:00:57.850> bring<00:00:58.210> this

00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:58.330 
3d modeling so if we try to bring this

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:01.140 
3d modeling so if we try to bring this
model<00:00:58.540> into<00:00:58.840> unreal<00:00:59.290> right<00:00:59.590> now<00:00:59.860> we'd<00:01:00.790> see<00:01:01.000> the

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:01.150 
model into unreal right now we'd see the

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:02.700 
model into unreal right now we'd see the
disconnect<00:01:01.450> that<00:01:01.810> there<00:01:01.960> can<00:01:02.110> sometimes<00:01:02.320> be

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:02.710 
disconnect that there can sometimes be

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:04.829 
disconnect that there can sometimes be
between<00:01:03.520> the<00:01:03.730> way<00:01:03.820> a<00:01:03.850> model<00:01:04.150> appears<00:01:04.480> in<00:01:04.690> the

00:01:04.829 --> 00:01:04.839 
between the way a model appears in the

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:07.830 
between the way a model appears in the
modeling<00:01:05.199> applications<00:01:05.860> such<00:01:06.130> as<00:01:06.160> Maya<00:01:06.550> and<00:01:06.850> a

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:07.840 
modeling applications such as Maya and a

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:10.740 
modeling applications such as Maya and a
3d<00:01:08.680> game<00:01:08.950> engine<00:01:09.210> well<00:01:10.210> know<00:01:10.390> that<00:01:10.420> we've<00:01:10.720> done

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:10.750 
3d game engine well know that we've done

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:12.720 
3d game engine well know that we've done
things<00:01:11.230> correctly<00:01:11.620> when<00:01:12.250> we've<00:01:12.430> eliminated

things correctly when we've eliminated

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:15.240 
things correctly when we've eliminated
that<00:01:13.150> disconnect<00:01:13.840> so<00:01:14.620> let's<00:01:14.830> see<00:01:14.950> what<00:01:15.100> can

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:15.250 
that disconnect so let's see what can

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:17.670 
that disconnect so let's see what can
happen<00:01:15.580> even<00:01:15.790> with<00:01:16.180> the<00:01:16.630> correct<00:01:16.960> FBX<00:01:17.500> export

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:17.680

happen even with the correct FBX export

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:34.270 
aren't it'll return an error and
actually<00:04:32.840> suggest<00:04:33.530> that<00:04:33.680> you<00:04:33.800> break<00:04:33.979> up<00:04:34.160> the

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:34.280 
actually suggest that you break up the

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:36.969 
actually suggest that you break up the
model<00:04:34.580> into<00:04:34.729> smaller<00:04:35.090> pieces<00:04:35.419> so<00:04:35.800> what<00:04:36.800> this

00:04:36.969 --> 00:04:36.979 
model into smaller pieces so what this

00:04:36.979 --> 00:04:38.950 
model into smaller pieces so what this
option<00:04:37.310> does<00:04:37.520> is<00:04:37.699> let<00:04:37.910> URI<00:04:38.090> combine<00:04:38.509> the<00:04:38.690> parts

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:38.960 
option does is let URI combine the parts

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:41.710 
option does is let URI combine the parts
into<00:04:39.139> one<00:04:39.350> larger<00:04:39.889> model<00:04:40.220> again<00:04:40.570> but<00:04:41.570> maybe

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:41.720 
into one larger model again but maybe

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:43.240 
into one larger model again but maybe
you'd<00:04:41.900> want<00:04:42.110> to<00:04:42.199> provide<00:04:42.500> yourself<00:04:42.949> some<00:04:43.100> more

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:38.270 
the quality of imperfectly modeled

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:40.659 
the quality of imperfectly modeled
meshes<00:05:38.750> and<00:05:38.870> it<00:05:39.620> does<00:05:39.800> this<00:05:39.949> by<00:05:40.130> removing<00:05:40.550> any

00:05:40.659 --> 00:05:40.669 
meshes and it does this by removing any

00:05:40.669 --> 00:05:44.620 
meshes and it does this by removing any
hidden<00:05:41.000> triangles<00:05:41.720> with<00:05:42.139> no<00:05:42.409> surface<00:05:42.919> area<00:05:43.630> so

00:05:49.839 --> 00:05:49.849 
it sets a static mesh and we can leave

00:05:49.849 --> 00:05:51.650 
it sets a static mesh and we can leave
it<00:05:49.970> there

we<00:05:52.560> want<00:05:52.770> materials<00:05:53.250> and<00:05:53.490> textures<00:05:53.940> to<00:05:54.060> be

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:54.330 
we want materials and textures to be

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:56.900 
we want materials and textures to be
included<00:05:54.750> so<00:05:55.380> we'll<00:05:55.830> check<00:05:56.100> both<00:05:56.280> those<00:05:56.610> and

00:05:56.900 --> 00:05:56.910 
included so we'll check both those and

00:05:56.910 --> 00:05:59.330 
included so we'll check both those and
we<00:05:57.810> can<00:05:57.960> also<00:05:58.110> select<00:05:58.440> create<00:05:59.100> groups

00:05:59.330 --> 00:05:59.340 
we can also select create groups

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:02.180 
we can also select create groups
automatically<00:06:00.560> finally<00:06:01.560> we<00:06:01.860> want<00:06:02.070> to

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:02.190 
automatically finally we want to

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:04.190 
automatically finally we want to
explicit<00:06:02.610> normals<00:06:03.000> and<00:06:03.180> we<00:06:03.840> can<00:06:03.990> let<00:06:04.170> it

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:04.200 
explicit normals and we can let it

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:07.490 
explicit normals and we can let it
remove<00:06:04.500> degeneres<00:06:05.570> now<00:06:06.570> we<00:06:06.630> can<00:06:06.990> go<00:06:07.140> ahead<00:06:07.170> and

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:07.500 
remove degeneres now we can go ahead and

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:12.720 
remove degeneres now we can go ahead and
hit<00:06:07.680> OK<00:06:07.980> and<00:06:08.220> unreal<00:06:09.000> will<00:06:09.390> load<00:06:09.600> the<00:06:09.750> model

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:16.810 
now if you'll remember in the previous
lesson<00:06:15.410> I<00:06:15.560> mentioned<00:06:16.160> that<00:06:16.220> even<00:06:16.370> if<00:06:16.580> we<00:06:16.700> get

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:16.820 
lesson I mentioned that even if we get

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:19.210 
lesson I mentioned that even if we get
the<00:06:16.970> settings<00:06:17.300> perfect<00:06:17.750> in<00:06:17.960> FBX<00:06:18.500> there's

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:19.220 
the settings perfect in FBX there's

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:20.890 
the settings perfect in FBX there's
still<00:06:19.520> plenty<00:06:19.730> of<00:06:19.940> room<00:06:20.120> for<00:06:20.240> things<00:06:20.600> to<00:06:20.690> go

00:06:20.890 --> 00:06:20.900 
still plenty of room for things to go

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:22.300 
still plenty of room for things to go

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:22.310 
awry which is what I'm demonstrating
