00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.389
 gadgets internet and technology climb up 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.910

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:15.210
 surfing er.ru search interesting stuff in 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.859
 internet on tuesday is somehow unnoticed and 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.750
 without much pathos in Russia earned 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:20.490
 google play music department

 emotionally well, that is, it is not only 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.869
 Cheat store but also powerful cloudy 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.689
 free service option it allows 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:32.550
 upload to google servers up to 20,000 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:34.410
 own tracks and listen to them in 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.600
 offline on any android device or 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.180
 through the browser besides it started 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.160
 aytyuns for similar music catalog but 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.079
 interesting another service called 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.300
 full access it allows you to listen 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:47.190
 and download any music to your device 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.170
 from the library starting from mid-November 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.120
 subscription will cost 190 rubles 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.710
 the first 30 days it is free in general 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.170
 good offer from domestic 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.539
 word masters and bayan can be found such 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:00.270
 performers like basta vera brezhnev 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:02.070
 silver and sergey lazarev average 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.680
 google play hospital is cheaper than analog 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.630
 from apple tracks cost from 6 to 19 rubles 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.070
 the album is mainly from a hundred to a hundred 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.750
 seventy but for serious profit 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.460
 the service should not be expected after all 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.799
 android devices a huge amount 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.240
 ways to get music for free but 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:17.340
 general educational 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.659
 the service still carries the mission and probably 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.220
 it is not bad especially as the prices 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:24.180
 google play educational policy 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:25.710
 more man loving than batiu mts already 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.810
 after about a week the world should be 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.810
 Presents a brand new Google Nexus 5 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:32.520
 and the latest version of android 4.4 kitkat 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.950
 and as usual in our information age 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.840
 the closer the presentation the more leaks 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.490
 catch fresh details new 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.049
 rumors say that the gadget is still 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.070
 provide a powerful snapdragon processor 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.990
 800 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.610
 what about a five-inch dick for the screen 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.369
 it would seem that no one doubts 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:49.579
 the battery should get a capacity of 2300 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:51.750
 milliampere hours and camera 8 megapixels 

00:01:49.579 --> 00:01:53.460
 possible with built-in stabilization 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.079
 gadget manufacturers is a company 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:57.090
 dji which as it turned out a year ago 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:59.250
 can make a very nice device 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.390
 under the clear guidance of big brother a 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.250
 Here to adjust timely deliveries 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.140
 smartphone shop then failed 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.939
 let's hope that now this is not 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:08.039
 will repeat as for the new android 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:09.899
 here and there are some screenshots of how 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:11.879
 seen in the system most likely from 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:14.159
 initiation giving scheme will become more 

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:14.790
 blue though rather it is called color 

00:02:14.159 --> 00:02:16.409
 sea ​​wave 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:18.360
 also it is impossible not to notice the new 

00:02:16.409 --> 00:02:20.610
 camera application in which the fishing line stood 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:22.650
 leather version of instagram and with find rivers 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:25.049
 and frames visible to spread about 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:26.819
 the effect of well photogravure in the social network google 

00:02:25.049 --> 00:02:28.890
 plus there is optical stabilization or 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:30.569
 no white or blue true or false 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:33.659
 most likely we will know all this on 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:35.340
 Presentations on October 14th we decided here 

00:02:33.659 --> 00:02:36.989
 to revive the rubric on our hands will be in two 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:38.700
 talk about some gadgets 

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:40.290
 who came to our editorial office and this 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:42.389
 times and highscreen alpha ice smartphone 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:44.819
 which design looks like an iphone 

00:02:42.389 --> 00:02:46.650
 still in it two sims and android curious 

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:49.590
 machine for little money detailed 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:51.060
 look at the review link and now to 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:53.220
 Our Korean friends have recently become 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:54.930
 it is known that very soon both samsung and lg 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:56.879
 going to introduce smartphones with 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:58.739
 curved screens about this device 

00:02:56.879 --> 00:03:00.689
 originally there was a rumor that it would be 

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:02.340
 protected version of galaxy laptop 3 but 

00:03:00.689 --> 00:03:04.139
 now there is evidence that it is still 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:06.389
 medium gadget 

00:03:04.139 --> 00:03:08.430
 hd display at 4 and 7 inches and 

00:03:06.389 --> 00:03:10.200
 last year's exynos processor 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:12.000
 what exactly will bend in it for now 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:13.439
 unclear most likely it is about 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.180
 original modified form 

00:03:13.439 --> 00:03:17.449
 display because the other components 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:20.129
 the battery and the chips are still too 

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:22.440
 hard for this dress from lg not 

00:03:20.129 --> 00:03:22.949
 almost nothing is known except the name g 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:24.660
 flex 

00:03:22.949 --> 00:03:27.150
 it is supposed to look like it will 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:29.489
 something like this there is also a stuffing about 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:30.870
 That device will receive 6-inch 

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:32.549
 screen both smartphones can be 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:34.260
 submitted very soon to appear in 

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:35.519
 sale in November so what if 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:38.579
 100 flowers bloom 

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:40.290
 but new technology is great however 

00:03:38.579 --> 00:03:42.150
 by itself she means nothing important 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:44.760
 think up how to solve those problems with it 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:46.750
 or other tasks and here with it at Koreans 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:48.940
 there may be problems 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:51.400
 today in the heading gvp talk about 

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:53.290
 one of a kind mr pj for 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:56.530
 windows phone from gameplay company 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:58.960
 called she warrant this kinda 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:01.540
 pocket clone of the popular game world of 

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:03.640
 warcraft with a huge world and five times 

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:06.250
 yourself to choose from humans and elves orcs 

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:08.020
 undead and incomprehensible creatures mendel 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:09.850
 my first you choose your class by 

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:11.800
 looks and then go perform 

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:13.870
 endless quests and in every way 

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:15.640
 pump your character over time 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:17.650
 you can join guilds to walk in 

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:19.600
 dungeon and fight with bosses are collected 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:21.609
 all sorts of loot and so on game 

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:23.490
 has a lot of players from other 

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:25.870
 platforms and is on the marketplace 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:27.940
 234 rubles the main thing do not forget that in 

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:30.250
 like games impossible to reach the end 

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:33.880
 you can play them forever so not 

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:35.410
 probably fill each of you though 

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:37.810
 just use wikipedia 

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:39.940
 and no one brian race offers a look 

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:41.830
 on global Internet encyclopedia 

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:43.390
 new he with his colleagues from 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:45.340
 Washington University all for 

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:47.560
 developed a service that handles 

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:49.960
 wikipedia pages and text based in 

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:52.330
 Information and photo creates three-dimensional 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:54.370
 object models for example for building 

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:55.770
 interior building service combing 

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:57.940
 related wikipedia article 

00:04:55.770 --> 00:05:00.100
 isolating all nouns 

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:02.500
 and then looking for suitable pictures in 

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:04.060
 google and magic and eventually exposes them 

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:06.400
 in those places of the interior where they should 

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:08.470
 so you can wikipedia 

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:10.120
 not only read but twist and twist and 

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:11.710
 peering from all sides think on 

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:13.780
 this creator will not stop dice 

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:17.260
 so in a year and the whole Internet will be 

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:19.750
 volumetric continuing theme of three-dimensional 

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:22.540
 objects are transferred to space or rather 

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:24.490
 to the international space station microsec 

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:26.710
 exactly there next fall nasa 

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:28.150
 plans to send the world's first 3d 

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:30.250
 a printer that will work in 

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:32.260
 absence of gravity 

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:34.120
 he is the creators will print 

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:36.970
 an astronaut almost anything 

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:39.280
 from the details of the spacesuit station itself to 

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:41.320
 gourmet dishes cosmic kitchen yet 

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:43.240
 that there is no details about the device itself 

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:44.080
 device but an experienced prototype is no longer 

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:45.850
 the first month 

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:48.040
 tested in laboratories on earth 

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:50.080
 another spider fat project which also 

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:52.570
 funded by us companies but in general 

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:54.880
 will allow to print designs and structures 

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:58.390
 in open space but its demonstration 

00:05:54.880 --> 00:06:00.560
 already planned for 2020 and there already look 

00:05:58.390 --> 00:06:03.900
 and this is not possible 

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:06.210
 but 3d printing won't surprise anyone anymore 

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:08.580
 you say 4d printing technology 

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:11.040
 I agree it sounds strange but very soon 

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:12.930
 she may appear here under the fourth 

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:14.730
 measurement is supposed to be created 

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:16.500
 the object will be able to change its properties in 

00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:18.210
 depending on the impact of external 

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:19.800
 factors for example changing color from 

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:22.020
 temperatures or become more 

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:24.240
 hard or soft when falling or hitting 

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:26.220
 that's how this cube changes its 

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:27.720
 form during immersion in liquid 

00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:29.340
 recently researchers from harvard 

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:32.790
 got a grant to make it happen 

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:34.350
 this technology in the amount of 800 55000 

00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:35.820
 dollars so far the example is not much 

00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:38.190
 impressive but just think about 

00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:40.230
 future prospects , subjects will be able to 

00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:42.030
 change their shape color and will 

00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:43.680
 practically alive and without military 

00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:45.540
 probably not done, I already see how they 

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:47.600
 dream that their tanks will be 

00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:50.430
 disguise as bushes 

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:52.560
 well enough about science and now let's talk about 

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:55.290
 music or rather about the device for her 

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:57.090
 play meet player split 

00:06:55.290 --> 00:06:59.670
 it looks like earplugs 

00:06:57.090 --> 00:07:00.840
 without any wires and knop when the player 

00:06:59.670 --> 00:07:03.000
 no headphones used 

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:05.070
 magnetized each other but worth them 

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.780
 split and in the speakers immediately starts 

00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:08.940
 play music with each other 

00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:10.980
 Headphones do not connect in fact 

00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:12.930
 each gag is perfect 

00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:15.450
 standalone device with its own memory

 heads 

00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:35.670
 one nod next track in two

 4 hours of work 

00:07:40.770 --> 00:07:44.550
 the world will cost 150 5 dollars if 

00:07:43.110 --> 00:07:46.170
 of course he will raise funds for 

00:07:44.550 --> 00:07:47.760
