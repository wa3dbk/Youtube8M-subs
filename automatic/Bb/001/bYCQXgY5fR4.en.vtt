00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:06.930
 table tennis helmet conquer the table 

00:00:04.549 --> 00:00:10.769
 Hallisch rarely welcome to start 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:12.150
 from the new project yes first exercise is for 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:14.070
 a very clear exercise for me 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.080
 I had steffen before 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.430
 I never trained just happens to 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.289
 sometimes seen play 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.939
 that's why it's about me in the beginning 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.310
 to choose an exercise that is very easy 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:27.090
 here is the case small big 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:29.849
 is called a volcano middle back forehand 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.199
 the two thiefs middle and before and 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:33.989
 course with the forehand play 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:36.510
 Very important in this exercise I play 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:39.750
 with over cut because of that 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.670
 easiest ball is from top spin and there 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.660
 you can look very good where the 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:47.340
 Starting point is at the forehand topspin 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:49.440
 that's why i will have this exercise now 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.660
 here at the beginning of the steffen first time 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.510
 to get to know me where to look 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:56.250
 go his mistakes like he plays draws 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.800
 he pulls very slowly rather quickly 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:01.020
 he pulls with spin or with how I am 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.789
 that is why first an exercise for 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.500
 I will get to know you here too 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:05.670
 already correct that we are the environment 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:10.880
 to see the video 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:10.880
 I wish you a lot of fun well knew 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:02:01.509
 Game analysis does not look like you're too much 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:04.270
 starts trying anyway while driving 

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:06.310
 I more pure lean me now and 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:08.709
 especially weight demands from the right 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:10.750
 on the left because many of your feather at 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:12.670
 the fores go over it and leave 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:14.560
 sign for that by everyone from the 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:15.069
 torso are now the just 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:17.560
 goes up 

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:21.280
 would you go in detail comes with it 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:23.049
 also flatter in my back only in 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:25.269
 Immerse belly and buys elbow 

00:02:23.049 --> 00:02:30.400
 let you reusable box more 

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:33.390
 Preparation tastes with the shoulder 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:33.390
 on main and rhine drifting 

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:25.960
 that a lot of balls with the card 

00:04:23.289 --> 00:04:27.970
 That's because we did 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:30.490
 not right out of sausage and meat 

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:33.190
 soon is trying more of 

00:04:30.490 --> 00:05:11.259
 to come to someone yes and me with that 

00:04:33.190 --> 00:05:13.419
 Turn the ball in so that soon the 

00:05:11.259 --> 00:05:15.340
 first exercise around cities together has me 

00:05:13.419 --> 00:05:17.530
 A lot helped the steffen too 

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:19.449
 getting to know the sources of error 

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:21.310
 So I think myself directly 

00:05:19.449 --> 00:05:24.190
 even on the basis of the videos hardly 

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:26.470
 Body use hardly any weight shifting 

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:29.080
 blow approach was often too high racket 

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:30.940
 open very hard the balls hit the 

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:33.699
 always had a lot of speed but no 

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:34.330
 curve so little were too thin 

00:05:33.699 --> 00:05:36.010
 met 

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:37.599
 yes and then I have now then 

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:39.669
 also the next exercises so structured 

00:05:37.599 --> 00:05:42.460
 on the basis of these first exercises 

00:05:39.669 --> 00:05:44.020
 of this first getting acquainted in the 

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:46.479
 next exercises are now in front of everyone 

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:49.449
 then the main focus is on that 

00:05:46.479 --> 00:05:51.009
 he uses it in the body because that's huge 

00:05:49.449 --> 00:05:53.080
 So much, that's where I said that 

00:05:51.009 --> 00:05:55.720
 After that the balls came much better 

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:57.009
 a lot more often and then we have to 

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:59.560
 of course, that he can do that 

00:05:57.009 --> 00:06:02.710
 balls thinner and clean 

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:05.110
 because it's enough keep because often 

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:07.419
 to play about if a ball with 

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:09.639
 spin or with rotation is often on 

00:06:07.419 --> 00:06:10.380
 the plate comes as the batter 

00:06:09.639 --> 00:06:12.550
 to the ball 

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:14.800
 that's why it is then synonymous 

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:16.870
 that's why everyone is switching to this 

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:18.880
 tomorrow and in the next few days 

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:20.889
 For a long time now I want to get the parts up 

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:23.050
 In any case, I like to enter 

00:06:20.889 --> 00:06:25.560
 feedback like this one this first now 

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:26.969
 Exercise , like you, finds it with the 

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:28.679
 with the 

00:06:26.969 --> 00:06:30.360
 finds in between and also 

00:06:28.679 --> 00:06:32.279
 what I personally told him 

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:34.049
 live that was all turned on very spontaneously 

00:06:32.279 --> 00:06:35.519
 but it is definitely fun for me 

00:06:34.049 --> 00:06:38.969
 made and I think that could 

00:06:35.519 --> 00:06:40.829
 every case new format on my channel 

00:06:38.969 --> 00:06:43.799
 because I think I'm learning this 

00:06:40.829 --> 00:06:45.509
 the audience, therefore, her enormous amount 

00:06:43.799 --> 00:06:46.889
 So if that was what it was like, 

00:06:45.509 --> 00:06:48.479
 There was a thumb 

00:06:46.889 --> 00:06:49.199
 up and turn one on tomorrow 

00:06:48.479 --> 00:06:51.860
 take care 

00:06:49.199 --> 00:06:51.860
