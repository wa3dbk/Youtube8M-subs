to get that team to open up I mean
they're<00:00:11.639> sitting<00:00:12.059> about<00:00:12.240> like<00:00:12.509> nine<00:00:12.780> men<00:00:13.080> in

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
they're sitting about like nine men in

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.020 
they're sitting about like nine men in
the<00:00:13.349> right<00:00:13.980> in<00:00:14.070> the<00:00:14.160> 18<00:00:14.490> and<00:00:14.700> it's<00:00:14.820> kind<00:00:14.969> of

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
the right in the 18 and it's kind of

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:16.880 
the right in the 18 and it's kind of
tough<00:00:15.210> so<00:00:15.509> we're<00:00:16.139> trying<00:00:16.350> to<00:00:16.440> move<00:00:16.529> the<00:00:16.680> ball<00:00:16.710> a

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890

tough so we're trying to move the ball a
little<00:00:17.010> bit<00:00:17.190> I<00:00:17.250> think<00:00:17.400> we<00:00:17.609> need<00:00:17.730> to<00:00:17.820> move<00:00:17.910> a

little bit I think we need to move a
little<00:00:18.090> bit<00:00:18.210> quicker<00:00:18.449> at<00:00:18.600> times<00:00:18.810> but<00:00:19.109> that's

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
little bit quicker at times but that's

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:21.170 
little bit quicker at times but that's
the<00:00:19.949> thing<00:00:19.980> we<00:00:20.250> had<00:00:20.340> plenty<00:00:20.520> of<00:00:20.670> chances<00:00:20.730> where

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
the thing we had plenty of chances where

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:22.730 
the thing we had plenty of chances where
we<00:00:21.270> could<00:00:21.420> I<00:00:21.449> usually<00:00:21.810> gotta<00:00:21.960> go<00:00:22.140> in<00:00:22.350> and<00:00:22.470> then

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
on my plane on the side in the middle of

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.149 
on my plane on the side in the middle of
the<00:01:21.330> field<00:01:21.540> and<00:01:21.810> i'm<00:01:22.020> really<00:01:22.200> not<00:01:22.470> and<00:01:22.710> then<00:01:23.070> I

of diamond and then I think I'm playing
at<00:01:26.670> the<00:01:26.759> top<00:01:26.909> of<00:01:26.939> the<00:01:27.090> mid<00:01:27.240> so<00:01:27.659> just<00:01:27.900> kinda

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
at the top of the mid so just kinda

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.050 
at the top of the mid so just kinda
confusing<00:01:28.409> at<00:01:28.560> times<00:01:28.590> I<00:01:29.070> just<00:01:29.790> gotta<00:01:29.909> keep

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
confusing at times I just gotta keep

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.940 
confusing at times I just gotta keep
working<00:01:30.390> at<00:01:30.509> it<00:01:30.540> I<00:01:30.780> mean<00:01:31.200> it's<00:01:31.439> a<00:01:31.530> position

working at it I mean it's a position

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.710 
working at it I mean it's a position
that<00:01:31.979> obviously<00:01:32.850> it's<00:01:33.150> been<00:01:33.180> about<00:01:33.570> a<00:01:33.630> year
