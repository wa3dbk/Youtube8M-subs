I<00:02:48.489> often<00:02:48.760> think<00:02:48.940> to<00:02:48.970> what<00:02:49.620> they<00:02:50.620> never<00:02:50.709> see<00:02:50.920> to

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:50.980

I often think to what they never see to
stipulate<00:02:51.250> there<00:02:51.520> but<00:02:51.790> I<00:02:51.880> said<00:02:52.030> they'd<00:02:52.150> like

00:02:52.199 --> 00:02:52.209 
stipulate there but I said they'd like

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:53.880 
stipulate there but I said they'd like
to<00:02:52.270> change<00:02:52.390> the<00:02:52.750> present<00:02:53.050> situation<00:02:53.140> to<00:02:53.680> what

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:53.890 
to change the present situation to what

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:55.710 
to change the present situation to what
they<00:02:54.250> don't<00:02:54.430> know<00:02:54.610> obviously<00:02:55.269> some<00:02:55.450> kind<00:02:55.570> of

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:55.720 
they don't know obviously some kind of

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:57.270 
they don't know obviously some kind of
utopia<00:02:56.170> which<00:02:56.380> is<00:02:56.500> buried<00:02:56.799> in<00:02:56.890> everybody's

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.280 
utopia which is buried in everybody's

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:59.220 
utopia which is buried in everybody's
head<00:02:57.430> I<00:02:57.549> think<00:02:57.760> the<00:02:57.850> ultimate<00:02:58.140> utopia<00:02:59.140> is

00:02:59.220 --> 00:02:59.230

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:00.720 
head I think the ultimate utopia is
where<00:02:59.380> everyone<00:02:59.709> just<00:02:59.830> gets<00:03:00.160> up<00:03:00.310> and<00:03:00.400> has<00:03:00.580> no

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:00.730 
where everyone just gets up and has no

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:03.449 
where everyone just gets up and has no
issues<00:03:01.030> yes<00:03:01.739> I<00:03:02.739> don't<00:03:03.130> know<00:03:03.220> if<00:03:03.280> that's

00:03:03.449 --> 00:03:03.459 
issues yes I don't know if that's
