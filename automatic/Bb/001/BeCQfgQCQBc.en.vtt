00:02:23.979 --> 00:02:23.989 
remember I've got to aim the camera and

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:26.690 
remember I've got to aim the camera and
do<00:02:24.989> the<00:02:25.140> straight<00:02:25.380> line<00:02:25.590> and<00:02:25.890> hopefully<00:02:26.549> not

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
do the straight line and hopefully not

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:28.430 
do the straight line and hopefully not
get<00:02:26.910> it<00:02:27.060> on<00:02:27.180> any<00:02:27.360> concrete<00:02:27.870> because<00:02:28.140> you<00:02:28.230> can't

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
get it on any concrete because you can't

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:32.720 
get it on any concrete because you can't
get<00:02:28.500> it<00:02:28.560> off<00:02:28.680> contry<00:02:30.799> so<00:02:31.799> I<00:02:32.130> like<00:02:32.489> take<00:02:32.700> a

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
get it off contry so I like take a

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:35.059 
get it off contry so I like take a
little<00:02:33.030> bit<00:02:33.269> of<00:02:33.329> a<00:02:33.420> DAB<00:02:33.630> here<00:02:34.110> and<00:02:34.290> here<00:02:34.920> this

00:02:35.059 --> 00:02:35.069 
little bit of a DAB here and here this

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:37.180 
little bit of a DAB here and here this
is<00:02:35.250> my<00:02:35.400> extra<00:02:35.819> paint<00:02:36.030> this<00:02:36.209> is<00:02:36.359> my<00:02:36.480> reservoir

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:37.190 
is my extra paint this is my reservoir

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:39.349 
is my extra paint this is my reservoir
see<00:02:38.190> and<00:02:38.310> then<00:02:38.430> what<00:02:38.549> I'll<00:02:38.670> do<00:02:38.790> is<00:02:38.910> I<00:02:38.940> start<00:02:39.060> up

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:39.359 
see and then what I'll do is I start up

00:02:39.359 --> 00:02:44.830 
see and then what I'll do is I start up
here<00:02:40.220> and<00:02:41.220> I<00:02:41.340> will<00:02:41.519> I<00:02:41.700> will<00:02:41.760> turn<00:02:42.269> my<00:02:42.329> brush

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:44.840 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:48.289 

slowly<00:02:45.840> go<00:02:45.989> down<00:02:46.019> on<00:02:46.380> the<00:02:46.500> very<00:02:46.739> edge<00:02:47.299> without

00:02:48.289 --> 00:02:48.299 
slowly go down on the very edge without

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:50.090 
slowly go down on the very edge without
moving<00:02:48.840> my<00:02:48.870> head<00:02:49.139> and<00:02:49.440> hopefully<00:02:49.769> holding<00:02:50.010> my

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
that now if you go if you go a little

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:04.729 
that now if you go if you go a little
bit<00:02:59.459> over<00:02:59.700> what<00:03:00.150> you<00:03:00.180> can<00:03:00.480> do<00:03:03.650> remember<00:03:04.650> don't

00:03:04.729 --> 00:03:04.739 
bit over what you can do remember don't

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:07.380 
use too much pain but what you can do is

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:11.300 
use too much pain but what you can do is
you<00:03:07.530> can<00:03:09.049> you<00:03:10.049> can<00:03:10.200> go<00:03:10.350> a<00:03:10.380> little<00:03:10.620> wider<00:03:10.950> on<00:03:11.190> the

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
you can you can go a little wider on the

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:16.240 
you can you can go a little wider on the
top<00:03:11.519> and<00:03:11.910> a<00:03:12.299> little<00:03:12.329> wider<00:03:13.220> on<00:03:14.220> the<00:03:14.639> bottom<00:03:15.000> and

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:16.250 
top and a little wider on the bottom and

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:19.339 
top and a little wider on the bottom and
it'll<00:03:17.250> kind<00:03:17.790> of<00:03:17.880> smooth<00:03:18.090> itself<00:03:18.450> out<00:03:18.599> but<00:03:19.290> I

00:03:19.339 --> 00:03:19.349 
it'll kind of smooth itself out but I

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:25.069 
it'll kind of smooth itself out but I
can't<00:03:19.620> do<00:03:19.739> this<00:03:20.450> with<00:03:23.660> and<00:03:24.660> you<00:03:24.750> can<00:03:24.900> see<00:03:25.049> that

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:25.079 
can't do this with and you can see that

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:26.539 
can't do this with and you can see that
looks<00:03:25.380> pretty<00:03:25.500> good<00:03:25.680> right<00:03:25.739> there<00:03:26.069> that's<00:03:26.400> on

00:03:26.539 --> 00:03:26.549 
looks pretty good right there that's on

looks pretty good right there that's on
one<00:03:26.670> coat<00:03:28.400> but<00:03:29.400> this<00:03:29.519> is<00:03:29.700> how<00:03:29.790> painters<00:03:30.180> paint

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:30.829

everything you know after four or five
paint<00:04:08.740> jobs<00:04:08.920> you<00:04:09.010> got<00:04:09.040> to<00:04:09.190> keep<00:04:09.280> bringing<00:04:09.580> it

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:09.640 
paint jobs you got to keep bringing it

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:12.570 
paint jobs you got to keep bringing it
over<00:04:09.840> but<00:04:10.840> you<00:04:10.990> can<00:04:11.110> see<00:04:11.290> how<00:04:11.320> I<00:04:11.470> cut<00:04:11.800> in<00:04:11.980> the

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:12.580 
over but you can see how I cut in the

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:16.220 
over but you can see how I cut in the
thing<00:04:12.790> is<00:04:12.910> it<00:04:13.030> takes<00:04:13.830> it<00:04:14.830> takes<00:04:14.890> practice<00:04:15.520> to

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:16.230 
thing is it takes it takes practice to

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:20.100 
thing is it takes it takes practice to
do<00:04:17.230> this<00:04:17.380> job<00:04:17.790> but<00:04:18.790> practice<00:04:19.239> is<00:04:19.360> not<00:04:19.420> what

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:20.110 
do this job but practice is not what

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:22.530 
do this job but practice is not what
we're<00:04:20.260> doing<00:04:20.530> right<00:04:20.680> now<00:04:21.120> what<00:04:22.120> we're<00:04:22.300> doing

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:22.540 
we're doing right now what we're doing

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:25.350 
we're doing right now what we're doing
right<00:04:22.690> now<00:04:22.750> is<00:04:23.110> technique<00:04:23.710> and<00:04:23.980> the<00:04:24.360> technique

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:25.360 
right now is technique and the technique

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:27.960 
right now is technique and the technique

00:04:59.370 --> 00:04:59.380 
would suggest is that if you're learning

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:01.680 
would suggest is that if you're learning
how<00:04:59.500> to<00:04:59.560> paint<00:04:59.800> and<00:05:00.040> you<00:05:00.190> go<00:05:00.970> on<00:05:01.150> youtube<00:05:01.540> and

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:06.300 
you look at some videos or on the net
look<00:05:04.960> at<00:05:05.080> everyone's<00:05:05.410> style<00:05:05.680> because

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:06.310 
look at everyone's style because

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:08.100

how<00:05:59.060> klinische<00:05:59.360> would<00:05:59.630> say<00:05:59.780> that<00:05:59.960> every<00:06:00.230> man

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:00.410 
how klinische would say that every man

00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:04.450 
how klinische would say that every man
has<00:06:00.620> to<00:06:00.650> know<00:06:00.890> his<00:06:01.010> own<00:06:01.100> limitations<00:06:01.720> so<00:06:02.720> I<00:06:03.460> was

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:14.450 
well a while and anyway it it's going to

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:17.740 
well a while and anyway it it's going to
look<00:06:14.600> really<00:06:14.630> good<00:06:16.420> when<00:06:17.420> it's<00:06:17.570> all<00:06:17.720> done
