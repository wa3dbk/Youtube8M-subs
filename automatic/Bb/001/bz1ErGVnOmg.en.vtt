00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:11.250
 we are here with alice miranda one of the 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:13.049
 great downhill beasts shivering 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.150
 best Brazilian driver on the ladder says 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:18.449
 Before, how do you have 58 account? 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:20.939
 for us here on the farm the farm 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:23.689
 city also reflected in the wrists 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:26.279
 cool, I can give you some curves 

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:28.380
 What can you do too fast too? 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.449
 the format of the event is very interesting is 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.700
 a differentiated business so this is a 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:35.100
 very cool event to make the 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.750
 Let's try and I was strong there. 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.120
 are 100% going to an injury that 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.540
 suffered in Canada but also in the middle of 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.629
 guys 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:45.899
 only up there with the boy 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:47.670
 we are already with more large stone copies 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:49.530
 downhill that will tell black that 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.920
 Quickly, how's that track today? 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:55.949
 here is the shimano fest 2002 josÃ© leal 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:58.890
 good play and 7 most important is 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:00.420
 I think the event the movement of 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.250
 a sports job several 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.120
 same day activities at the same end 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.129
 of week 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.229
 I think today 's the best this is 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:10.979
 but the fun track at the beginning is 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:14.310
 very good in the middle of the track since 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:18.030
 very strong pedal but it's really fucking cool 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:20.850
 I think shimano 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.200
 Once again, congratulations, this is special. 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.170
 It was an event going to be a story. 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:27.299
 sandy is going to be our present in a 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.830
 Concert strategies to sell their 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:32.729
 goods not to mention the day 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:34.080
 I've been in the week for many years but it's 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:36.000
 amazing what they are doing 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:39.600
 here so much for once that 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:42.869
 trophy very much to him the idea is to 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:47.479
 We always come to get a physical part. 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:51.960
 is not on the best level and dvd at home the 

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:53.850
 team performs there but we here are a 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.590
 dream of trying to accelerate a better era 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:59.810
 it goes down 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.810
 oh look look
