 Hello, how are youtube people? 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:07.560
 sebastiÃ¡n today I will show you how to download 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.480
 this great ironman game that comes super 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:12.120
 compressed but I will teach them to 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.830
 install it first of all we go to the 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.670
 page of the download that is in the 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.670
 link of the description 

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:23.810
 once we are on the page of the 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:26.750
 download will show us a quick test 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:29.510
 which is to know if they are good bots or you 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:32.090
 we give download now we just have to 

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:34.100
 wait for the download to finish 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:36.970
 I cancel the download but I'll show you 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:36.970
 how it is installed 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:43.730
 we go to downloads we take the file and 

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:45.680
 we move it to the desk now we give it 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:48.440
 run as administrator and we give you 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:50.899
 install once finished installing 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:53.410
 we go to the folder and we give it where it says 

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:53.410
 install 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:12.400
 once installed we go to the folder 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:14.490
 where ironman says there are several files 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:17.260
 but we give it where it says install 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:19.240
 now we just wait for it to settle 

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:21.930
 to use the video because it takes a bit 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:21.930
 in settling 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:51.520
 when in the middle of the discharge 

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:51.520
 it will come out this you give it yes 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:32.400
 now that it's finished downloading we're going 

00:02:29.939 --> 00:02:34.379
 to try the game so that afterwards 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:37.519
 say that the game does not work because 

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:37.519
 I will play heard xd 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:18.560
 good is very good 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:27.319
 this video game of the year 2008 is based on 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:29.769
 the movie of the same name published 

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:33.470
 by sega and available for xbox 360 

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:36.819
 playstation 23 and portable nintendo ds 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:36.819
 wii and pc 

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:44.590
 ironman the video game basically deals 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:46.720
 to safeguard the weapons created by tony 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:49.270
 stark and destroy those that are in bad 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:51.760
 hands as well as others created from 

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:54.220
 its technology the game is full of 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:56.680
 action challenges and many explosions 

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:59.140
 but leaves much to be desired the 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:01.000
 graphs are regular could be said 

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:03.330
 that the suit or armor of the superhero 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:06.220
 it looks bad since it is not very detailed 

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:08.320
 strange aspect since the concept of a 

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:10.570
 superhero with advanced armor 

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:13.330
 technology offers for a long time what 

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:15.490
 that's been all friends I hope there's 

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:19.239
 liked to give little man up if they liked it 

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:22.120
 doubts complaints complaints also comment
