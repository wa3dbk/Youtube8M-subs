problems with uploading pictures so that

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:15.580 
problems with uploading pictures so that
it's<00:04:13.700> not<00:04:13.849> taking<00:04:14.569> this<00:04:14.659> URL<00:04:14.989> so<00:04:15.319> what<00:04:15.499> we're

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:15.590 
it's not taking this URL so what we're

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:16.449 
it's not taking this URL so what we're
going<00:04:15.680> to<00:04:15.799> do<00:04:15.920> is<00:04:16.070> we're<00:04:16.160> going<00:04:16.250> to<00:04:16.370> go<00:04:16.430> ahead

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:16.459 
going to do is we're going to go ahead

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:20.379 
going to do is we're going to go ahead
and<00:04:16.759> just<00:04:17.000> highlight<00:04:18.579> the<00:04:19.579> root<00:04:20.030> directory

00:04:20.379 --> 00:04:20.389 
and just highlight the root directory

00:04:20.389 --> 00:04:23.800 
and just highlight the root directory
the<00:04:20.870> URL<00:04:21.259> there<00:04:21.500> and<00:04:22.240> so<00:04:23.240> all<00:04:23.300> you<00:04:23.449> need<00:04:23.599> to<00:04:23.690> do

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:23.810 
the URL there and so all you need to do

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:26.770 
the URL there and so all you need to do
is<00:04:23.840> have<00:04:24.139> the<00:04:24.320> WP<00:04:24.860> content<00:04:25.039> uploads<00:04:25.789> just<00:04:26.599> copy

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:26.780 
is have the WP content uploads just copy

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:28.779 
is have the WP content uploads just copy
that<00:04:27.020> from<00:04:27.199> there<00:04:27.380> now<00:04:28.039> what<00:04:28.490> I<00:04:28.520> would<00:04:28.669> suggest

00:04:28.779 --> 00:04:28.789 
that from there now what I would suggest

00:04:28.789 --> 00:04:32.560 
that from there now what I would suggest
is<00:04:29.210> that<00:04:29.240> you<00:04:29.389> do<00:04:29.690> copy<00:04:29.930> the<00:04:30.110> whole<00:04:30.259> thing<00:04:31.570> and

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:32.570 
is that you do copy the whole thing and

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:34.360 
is that you do copy the whole thing and
give<00:04:32.690> that<00:04:32.840> a<00:04:32.870> shot<00:04:32.990> but<00:04:33.410> sometimes<00:04:34.220> what

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:34.370 
give that a shot but sometimes what

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:36.640 
give that a shot but sometimes what
happens<00:04:34.400> with<00:04:34.849> that<00:04:34.880> is<00:04:35.150> it<00:04:35.360> pulls<00:04:35.660> in<00:04:35.930> just

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:36.650 
happens with that is it pulls in just

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:39.040 
happens with that is it pulls in just
the<00:04:37.370> text<00:04:37.820> or<00:04:38.060> it's<00:04:38.270> not<00:04:38.389> pulling<00:04:38.660> the<00:04:38.750> picture

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:39.050 
the text or it's not pulling the picture

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:40.779 
the text or it's not pulling the picture
it's<00:04:39.229> calling<00:04:39.440> the<00:04:39.530> post<00:04:39.710> name<00:04:39.919> not<00:04:40.639> sure

00:04:40.779 --> 00:04:40.789 
it's calling the post name not sure

00:04:40.789 --> 00:04:43.180 
it's calling the post name not sure
what's<00:04:41.060> going<00:04:41.180> on<00:04:41.270> but<00:04:41.530> this<00:04:42.530> will<00:04:43.039> get<00:04:43.160> a

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:43.190 
what's going on but this will get a

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:45.909 
what's going on but this will get a
solution<00:04:43.520> for<00:04:43.820> that<00:04:43.880> okay<00:04:44.710> so<00:04:45.710> now<00:04:45.800> we're

00:04:45.909 --> 00:04:45.919 
solution for that okay so now we're

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:46.990 
solution for that okay so now we're
going<00:04:46.009> to<00:04:46.070> do<00:04:46.160> is<00:04:46.250> we're<00:04:46.400> going<00:04:46.550> to<00:04:46.610> want<00:04:46.849> to
