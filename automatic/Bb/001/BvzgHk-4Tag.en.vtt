from what I can tell
Monique<00:03:30.370> system<00:03:30.700> was<00:03:30.820> completely<00:03:31.240> drained<00:03:31.480> of

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:31.690 
Monique system was completely drained of

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:33.900 
Monique system was completely drained of
amino<00:03:31.990> acids<00:03:32.410> what<00:03:32.950> does<00:03:33.040> that<00:03:33.070> mean<00:03:33.370> they're

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:33.910 
amino acids what does that mean they're

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:35.880 
amino acids what does that mean they're
essential<00:03:34.390> organic<00:03:34.780> compounds<00:03:35.410> just<00:03:35.740> about

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:35.890 
essential organic compounds just about

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:37.680 
essential organic compounds just about
all<00:03:36.070> living<00:03:36.340> things<00:03:36.370> need<00:03:36.670> for<00:03:37.000> survival

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:37.690 
all living things need for survival

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:39.570 
all living things need for survival
those<00:03:37.840> mutated<00:03:38.500> stalks<00:03:38.830> must<00:03:39.190> be<00:03:39.340> draining

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:39.580 
those mutated stalks must be draining

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:41.460 
those mutated stalks must be draining
amino<00:03:40.000> acids<00:03:40.480> out<00:03:40.630> of<00:03:40.750> everything<00:03:41.110> they<00:03:41.230> touch

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:41.470 
amino acids out of everything they touch

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:44.160 
amino acids out of everything they touch
which<00:03:42.250> also<00:03:42.520> explains<00:03:43.000> why<00:03:43.180> Godzilla<00:03:43.780> almost

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:44.170 
which also explains why Godzilla almost

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:45.990 
which also explains why Godzilla almost
collapsed<00:03:44.800> you<00:03:45.310> think<00:03:45.520> the<00:03:45.580> big<00:03:45.730> guys<00:03:45.850> gonna

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:46.000 
collapsed you think the big guys gonna

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.090 
collapsed you think the big guys gonna
be<00:03:46.150> okay<00:03:46.420> well<00:03:46.990> amino<00:03:47.350> acids<00:03:47.710> are<00:03:47.800> produced

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:48.100 
be okay well amino acids are produced

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:48.990 
be okay well amino acids are produced
during<00:03:48.190> digestion

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:49.000 
during digestion

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.730 
during digestion
so<00:03:49.120> if<00:03:49.240> Godzilla's<00:03:49.750> system<00:03:50.140> wasn't<00:03:50.470> totally

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:50.740 
so if Godzilla's system wasn't totally

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:53.210 
so if Godzilla's system wasn't totally
depleted<00:03:51.160> he<00:03:51.820> should<00:03:52.000> recover<00:03:52.210> after<00:03:52.630> he<00:03:52.720> eats

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:53.220 
depleted he should recover after he eats

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:56.370 
depleted he should recover after he eats
Monet's<00:03:54.220> condition<00:03:54.640> is<00:03:54.730> too<00:03:55.180> severe<00:03:55.570> she's

Monet's condition is too severe she's

00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:00.660 
Monet's condition is too severe she's
gonna<00:03:56.560> need<00:03:56.770> several<00:03:56.950> transfusions<00:03:59.670> that's

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:00.670 
gonna need several transfusions that's

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:02.250 
gonna need several transfusions that's
when<00:04:01.000> we<00:04:01.150> dove<00:04:01.360> into<00:04:01.510> the<00:04:01.750> river<00:04:01.930> and<00:04:02.080> hit

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:02.260 
when we dove into the river and hit

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:02.850 
when we dove into the river and hit
underwater
