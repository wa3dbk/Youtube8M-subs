00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:10.869
 and this icon will appear 

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:16.930
 at the desk is worth the winds 

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:19.630
 win-win of that pro and good we open it and 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:21.430
 will offer us this is true that by the way 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:24.310
 This reminds me of light do not know 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:27.180
 why but it looks like light and so if 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:27.180
 you think like me 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:34.150
 pokÃ©mon fans you will see it you will know 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:37.450
 but good as you can see gives us 44 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:39.910
 emulators with which we can play 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:41.770
 to a game of bs therefore I have 

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:44.800
 the Karl Kart but it can be any 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:47.230
 another I have it here now I will teach you 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:50.050
 how to use it but good we started the 

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:52.120
 We are here as you can see simply 

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:55.480
 I think we have to give this one 

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:58.150
 We give here and choose your yours 

00:01:55.480 --> 00:02:01.540
 game but but this one I think it serves to 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:04.870
 nds file and file that you see wants 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:06.270
 say you can play game boy games 

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:08.489
 advance in 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.410
 in this emulator I also think that in 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:12.090
 all try it to see but I think that 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:13.650
 simply in this but in this it will go 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:15.689
 very well 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:17.400
 in the description by the way I'll leave you 

00:02:15.689 --> 00:02:21.840
 a page where you can download 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:25.439
 games for the nintendo dsi the nba is worth 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:28.349
 the gameboy advance and nintendo 64 and the 

00:02:25.439 --> 00:02:30.840
 color and all that kind of stuff I think that 

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:32.879
 3DS but we will not have that to 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:35.460
 below in the description good this is 

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:39.000
 more of the same we give here 

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:42.870
 and he asks us to open the file and we choose the 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:48.530
 mario kart the equal cut and the v 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:48.530
 we bring players numbers here 1 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:54.040
 and file open like all good I 

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:55.680
 I'm going to teach with the clearing that 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:58.450
 I'm the best of the four 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:00.160
 Sincerely to play Nintendo DS 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:02.830
 at least for gba I recommend you 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:04.959
 you see this one is not that I see that 

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:08.040
 here and it's already good but I'm going to 

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:11.350
 teach the mario kart let's give it here 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:16.150
 this will not be and we will file to 

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:19.800
 open rom desktop and mario kart here 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:19.800
 is and we are going to open lower the volume 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:28.159
 OK 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:31.670
 [Music] 

00:03:28.159 --> 00:03:35.519
 just in case something of copyright jumps 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:39.620
 as you can see you can play we give 

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:39.620
 to a preparation I'm going to 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:44.420
 OK 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:47.599
 as you can see we give a 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:50.660
 player here gives us by default 

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:52.459
 the nickname because we can play big 

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:56.000
 it also happens that it is less than worse 

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:57.200
 quality but good we're going to not and here 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.140
 You can put your name and I'll 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:02.239
 pain better put my name 

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:03.620
 I wear for games 

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:07.640
 r2 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:10.970
 the center of the girl if I do not want 

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:14.570
 shield a player 

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:20.170
 and the grand prix contracts the 50cc what 

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:25.060
 you want so nothing now would be to give 

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:26.730
 file and close rom and you 're done already 

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:29.460
 I would remove it 

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:32.050
 and nothing else simply that state you can 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:34.090
 see works pretty well 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:36.250
 do not see you I recommend it to play 

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:39.099
 the games of ds I recommend the des 

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:41.710
 muni and the others I have not tried them but 

00:04:39.099 --> 00:04:45.009
 tried to see but good the clearing 

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:47.860
 for me it is the best and so nothing this 

00:04:45.009 --> 00:04:50.340
 It has been everything I hope it has served you 

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:50.340
 a lot 

00:04:50.569 --> 00:04:56.089
 tutorial has been short but pretty 

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:58.460
 quite productive I think it has 

00:04:56.089 --> 00:05:01.099
 been pretty good if it's been yes 

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:03.289
 you think the same as me then give it a like 

00:05:01.099 --> 00:05:04.610
 to the video and if you like it enough and you 

00:05:03.289 --> 00:05:07.399
 like my other videos you can 

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:09.919
 subscribe if you are not subscribed and 

00:05:07.399 --> 00:05:12.270
 nothing more kids this has been all if 

00:05:09.919 --> 00:05:15.630
 you liked it 

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:17.310
 well and if not then too and nothing else 

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:19.910
 dismissal and until the next kids 

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:19.910
 goodbye
