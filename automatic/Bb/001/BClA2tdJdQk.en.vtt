the United Nations said a shameful

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.440 
the United Nations said a shameful
figure<00:01:31.560> it's<00:01:31.920> said<00:01:32.159> rightly<00:01:32.460> so<00:01:32.700> is<00:01:32.909> this

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
figure it's said rightly so is this

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.330 
figure it's said rightly so is this
accurate<00:01:33.960> or<00:01:34.079> do<00:01:34.229> you<00:01:34.320> think<00:01:34.350> this<00:01:35.009> is<00:01:35.189> perhaps

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
accurate or do you think this is perhaps

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.340 
accurate or do you think this is perhaps
even<00:01:35.610> perhaps<00:01:36.299> we<00:01:36.450> reach<00:01:36.630> that<00:01:36.659> figure<00:01:37.110> quite

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
even perhaps we reach that figure quite

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.230 
even perhaps we reach that figure quite
a<00:01:37.380> while<00:01:37.680> ago<00:01:37.829> well<00:01:38.790> it's<00:01:38.939> actually<00:01:39.030> the

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
a while ago well it's actually the

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.330 
a while ago well it's actually the
number<00:01:39.509> of<00:01:39.689> registered<00:01:40.290> refugees<00:01:40.740> so<00:01:41.189> you're

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
number of registered refugees so you're

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:42.560 
number of registered refugees so you're

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
quite right that actually the number

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:43.340 
quite right that actually the number

that<00:01:54.210> the<00:01:54.810> 1<00:01:54.960> million<00:01:55.229> figure<00:01:55.530> is<00:01:55.920> shocking

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
that the 1 million figure is shocking

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.130

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
milestone and it really shows just the

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:01.880 
milestone and it really shows just the
failure<00:02:00.689> of<00:02:00.840> the<00:02:01.079> international<00:02:01.170> community
