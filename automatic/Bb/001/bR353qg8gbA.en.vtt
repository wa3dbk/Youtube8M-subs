that's totally your choice what I did is

00:02:10.129 --> 00:02:13.300 
that's totally your choice what I did is
I<00:02:10.250> put<00:02:10.489> this<00:02:10.640> on<00:02:10.910> both<00:02:11.180> sides<00:02:11.599> of<00:02:12.110> the<00:02:12.530> lower

I put this on both sides of the lower
part<00:02:13.849> of<00:02:14.180> the<00:02:14.959> door

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610 
part of the door

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:19.270 
part of the door
when<00:02:17.180> you<00:02:17.330> open<00:02:17.750> the<00:02:17.900> top<00:02:18.200> the<00:02:18.680> bottom<00:02:18.920> will

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280 
when you open the top the bottom will

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:21.850 
when you open the top the bottom will
not<00:02:19.490> flip<00:02:19.970> open<00:02:20.390> you'll<00:02:20.900> have<00:02:21.080> to<00:02:21.260> physically

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:21.860 
not flip open you'll have to physically

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:25.360 
not flip open you'll have to physically
take<00:02:22.430> both<00:02:22.820> sides<00:02:23.260> of<00:02:24.260> the<00:02:24.530> barrel<00:02:24.860> bolt<00:02:25.040> mouth

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:25.370 
take both sides of the barrel bolt mouth

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:28.570 
take both sides of the barrel bolt mouth
so<00:02:25.970> it<00:02:26.150> open<00:02:26.570> all<00:02:26.810> the<00:02:27.050> way<00:02:27.230> and<00:02:27.680> the<00:02:28.400> good

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:28.580 
so it open all the way and the good

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:30.580 
so it open all the way and the good
thing<00:02:28.790> about<00:02:28.820> it<00:02:29.090> is<00:02:29.300> is<00:02:29.600> adds<00:02:29.990> some<00:02:30.380> more

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:30.590 
thing about it is is adds some more

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:32.680 
thing about it is is adds some more
support<00:02:31.040> so<00:02:31.370> it<00:02:31.460> makes<00:02:31.670> it<00:02:31.820> a<00:02:31.940> lot<00:02:32.090> harder<00:02:32.150> just

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:32.690 
support so it makes it a lot harder just

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:36.460 
support so it makes it a lot harder just
to<00:02:32.840> yank<00:02:33.140> the<00:02:33.230> thing<00:02:33.560> open<00:02:34.930> basement<00:02:35.930> doors

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:36.470 
to yank the thing open basement doors

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:38.830 
to yank the thing open basement doors
are<00:02:36.770> put<00:02:37.040> on<00:02:37.160> from<00:02:37.430> the<00:02:37.550> outside<00:02:38.030> this<00:02:38.630> is

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:38.840 
are put on from the outside this is

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:41.440 
are put on from the outside this is
definitely<00:02:39.230> security<00:02:39.950> risk<00:02:40.220> how<00:02:40.910> I<00:02:40.940> handled

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450 
definitely security risk how I handled

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:44.710 
definitely security risk how I handled
this<00:02:41.660> was<00:02:42.020> I<00:02:42.350> went<00:02:42.620> to<00:02:42.710> a<00:02:42.910> good<00:02:43.910> hardware<00:02:44.420> store

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:44.720 
this was I went to a good hardware store

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:46.900 
this was I went to a good hardware store
and<00:02:45.020> bought<00:02:45.200> some<00:02:45.260> security<00:02:46.100> screws<00:02:46.460> I<00:02:46.790> also

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:46.910 
and bought some security screws I also

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:50.560 
and bought some security screws I also
got<00:02:47.270> the<00:02:47.420> bit<00:02:47.690> and<00:02:48.350> a<00:02:48.890> lot<00:02:49.070> of<00:02:49.100> times<00:02:49.570> hardware

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:50.570 
got the bit and a lot of times hardware

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:53.260 
got the bit and a lot of times hardware
stores<00:02:50.930> will<00:02:51.560> have<00:02:51.590> the<00:02:52.160> screws<00:02:52.490> but<00:02:52.850> not<00:02:53.060> the

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:53.270 
stores will have the screws but not the

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:56.380 
stores will have the screws but not the
bit<00:02:53.480> so<00:02:54.440> consequently<00:02:54.890> I<00:02:55.459> had<00:02:55.820> to<00:02:55.940> look<00:02:56.090> around

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:56.390 
bit so consequently I had to look around

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:57.070 
bit so consequently I had to look around
a<00:02:56.600> little<00:02:56.630> bit

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:57.080 
a little bit

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:59.380 
a little bit
of<00:02:57.770> course<00:02:58.070> anybody<00:02:58.340> can<00:02:58.700> go<00:02:58.850> in<00:02:59.000> and<00:02:59.150> get<00:02:59.240> the

00:02:59.380 --> 00:02:59.390 
of course anybody can go in and get the

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:02.050 
of course anybody can go in and get the
security<00:02:59.990> bits<00:03:00.230> in<00:03:00.590> that<00:03:00.860> they<00:03:01.520> would<00:03:01.700> have<00:03:01.850> to

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.060 
security bits in that they would have to

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:04.030 
security bits in that they would have to
have<00:03:02.240> it<00:03:02.390> with<00:03:02.570> them<00:03:02.750> before<00:03:03.110> they<00:03:03.290> even<00:03:03.560> tried

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:04.040 
have it with them before they even tried

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:06.699 
have it with them before they even tried

important<00:03:10.970> down<00:03:11.150> there<00:03:11.450> you<00:03:12.230> shouldn't<00:03:12.650> put

but<00:03:15.440> one<00:03:15.590> of<00:03:15.620> the<00:03:15.740> first<00:03:15.890> things<00:03:16.190> I<00:03:16.400> did<00:03:16.640> when<00:03:16.850> I

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:16.880 
but one of the first things I did when I

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:20.470 
but one of the first things I did when I

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:20.480 
shored up my fifth wheel security was to

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:23.800 
shored up my fifth wheel security was to
change<00:03:20.810> out<00:03:21.170> my<00:03:21.590> entry<00:03:22.550> door<00:03:22.790> line<00:03:23.060> the<00:03:23.480> one<00:03:23.630> on

the<00:03:26.630> right<00:03:26.930> is<00:03:27.290> the<00:03:27.560> new<00:03:27.709> one<00:03:27.920> it<00:03:28.160> you'll<00:03:28.880> be

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:29.090 
the right is the new one it you'll be

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:31.479 
the right is the new one it you'll be
seeing<00:03:29.390> what<00:03:30.019> the<00:03:30.230> different<00:03:30.620> keys<00:03:30.860> look<00:03:31.220> like

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:33.080 
the one on the right definitely is

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:36.580 
the one on the right definitely is
higher<00:03:33.320> security<00:03:33.950> it<00:03:34.370> has<00:03:34.730> the<00:03:35.420> key<00:03:35.989> teeth<00:03:36.290> on

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:36.590 
higher security it has the key teeth on

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:39.759 
higher security it has the key teeth on
both<00:03:36.860> sides<00:03:37.900> instead<00:03:38.900> of<00:03:38.989> on<00:03:39.110> a<00:03:39.140> single<00:03:39.560> side

00:03:39.759 --> 00:03:39.769 
both sides instead of on a single side

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:41.410 
both sides instead of on a single side
like<00:03:40.070> the<00:03:40.220> original<00:03:40.670> and<00:03:40.880> you'll<00:03:41.150> need<00:03:41.360> a

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:41.420 
like the original and you'll need a

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:44.259 
like the original and you'll need a
special<00:03:41.720> star<00:03:42.470> bit<00:03:42.769> in<00:03:43.010> order<00:03:43.190> to<00:03:43.310> get<00:03:43.880> the<00:03:44.090> old

00:03:44.259 --> 00:03:44.269 
special star bit in order to get the old

special star bit in order to get the old
lock<00:03:44.570> off<00:03:44.840> to<00:03:45.050> be<00:03:45.170> able<00:03:45.260> to<00:03:45.440> put<00:03:45.620> the<00:03:45.739> new<00:03:45.890> one

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:46.070 
lock off to be able to put the new one

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:48.250 
lock off to be able to put the new one
in<00:03:46.190> when<00:03:46.850> I<00:03:46.880> decided<00:03:47.360> that<00:03:47.510> I<00:03:47.690> was<00:03:47.930> going<00:03:48.110> to

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:48.260 
in when I decided that I was going to

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.350 
in when I decided that I was going to
get<00:03:48.380> another<00:03:48.709> entry<00:03:49.519> door<00:03:49.700> lock<00:03:50.000> and<00:03:50.269> the

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:50.360 
get another entry door lock and the

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:52.660 
get another entry door lock and the
reason<00:03:50.750> I<00:03:50.870> did<00:03:51.080> is<00:03:51.260> because<00:03:51.290> Mike<00:03:52.040> he<00:03:52.340> was

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:52.670 
reason I did is because Mike he was

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:55.140 
reason I did is because Mike he was
warned<00:03:53.000> and<00:03:53.150> it<00:03:53.330> didn't<00:03:53.630> really<00:03:54.050> want<00:03:54.350> to<00:03:54.470> open

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:55.150 
warned and it didn't really want to open

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:57.580 
warned and it didn't really want to open
the<00:03:56.150> fifth<00:03:56.420> wheel<00:03:56.630> anymore<00:03:56.900> I<00:03:57.080> didn't<00:03:57.350> want<00:03:57.500> to

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:57.590 
the fifth wheel anymore I didn't want to

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:00.040 
the fifth wheel anymore I didn't want to
get<00:03:57.709> caught<00:03:58.160> out<00:03:58.430> someplace<00:03:59.420> when<00:03:59.870> I'm

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:00.050
