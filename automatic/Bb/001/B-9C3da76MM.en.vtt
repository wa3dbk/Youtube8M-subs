kind<00:01:18.750> of<00:01:18.780> eke<00:01:18.990> out<00:01:19.110> a<00:01:19.170> living<00:01:19.380> and<00:01:19.770> and<00:01:19.979> and

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
kind of eke out a living and and and

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:21.980 
kind of eke out a living and and and
take<00:01:20.610> what<00:01:20.820> little<00:01:21.030> they<00:01:21.119> have<00:01:21.330> and<00:01:21.600> bring<00:01:21.899> it

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
down there and not exactly prosper I

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:25.880 
down there and not exactly prosper I
mean<00:01:24.690> I<00:01:24.720> think<00:01:24.840> they're<00:01:25.140> they<00:01:25.350> barely<00:01:25.619> have

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
mean I think they're they barely have

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.430 
mean I think they're they barely have
enough<00:01:25.920> to<00:01:26.280> eat<00:01:26.310> in<00:01:26.700> the<00:01:27.270> book<00:01:27.479> it<00:01:27.750> describes

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:28.440 
enough to eat in the book it describes

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:31.100 
enough to eat in the book it describes
them<00:01:28.649> all<00:01:28.860> as<00:01:29.130> being<00:01:29.670> very<00:01:30.060> very<00:01:30.270> thin<00:01:30.720> which<00:01:30.990> I

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
them all as being very very thin which I

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:32.510 
them all as being very very thin which I
thought<00:01:31.259> was<00:01:31.409> interesting<00:01:31.560> that<00:01:32.009> basically

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
thought was interesting that basically

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:33.710 
thought was interesting that basically
they've<00:01:32.820> been<00:01:32.970> you<00:01:33.149> know<00:01:33.270> living<00:01:33.509> on<00:01:33.630> these

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
they've been you know living on these

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.109 
they've been you know living on these
tiny<00:01:33.960> rations<00:01:34.470> and<00:01:35.399> I<00:01:35.550> don't<00:01:35.700> think<00:01:35.880> it's<00:01:36.000> not

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
tiny rations and I don't think it's not

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:37.100 
tiny rations and I don't think it's not
it's<00:01:36.270> not<00:01:36.360> a<00:01:36.420> place<00:01:36.630> where<00:01:36.750> there's<00:01:36.869> a<00:01:36.899> lot<00:01:36.960> of

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
it's not a place where there's a lot of

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.370 
it's not a place where there's a lot of
light<00:01:37.410> it's<00:01:37.920> not<00:01:38.130> a<00:01:38.160> lot<00:01:38.460> of<00:01:39.050> laughter<00:01:40.050> there's

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
light it's not a lot of laughter there's

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.090 
light it's not a lot of laughter there's
not<00:01:40.500> a<00:01:40.560> lot<00:01:40.710> of<00:01:40.740> fun<00:01:41.240> I<00:01:42.679> think<00:01:43.679> it's<00:01:43.800> people

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
not a lot of fun I think it's people

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:50.230 
not a lot of fun I think it's people
just<00:01:44.820> barely<00:01:45.659> getting<00:01:46.200> by

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:50.240 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:52.149 

read<00:01:50.450> them<00:01:50.600> all<00:01:50.689> the<00:01:50.750> way<00:01:50.840> through<00:01:51.079> and<00:01:51.470> I'm

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:52.159 
read them all the way through and I'm

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:54.490 
read them all the way through and I'm
like<00:01:52.340> I<00:01:52.750> wouldn't<00:01:53.750> be<00:01:53.840> in<00:01:53.899> this<00:01:53.960> movie<00:01:54.170> and

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:54.500 
like I wouldn't be in this movie and

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:56.770 
like I wouldn't be in this movie and
clearly<00:01:55.220> that<00:01:55.430> was<00:01:55.579> the<00:01:55.610> only<00:01:55.939> part<00:01:56.509> that<00:01:56.600> I

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:56.780 
clearly that was the only part that I

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:59.889 
clearly that was the only part that I
could<00:01:57.020> play<00:01:57.310> coin<00:01:58.310> is<00:01:58.670> very<00:01:58.970> sparingly<00:01:59.540> drawn

00:01:59.889 --> 00:01:59.899 
could play coin is very sparingly drawn

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:01.450 
could play coin is very sparingly drawn

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:04.310 
because she's only spoken about from

because she's only spoken about from
Katniss's<00:02:04.789> point<00:02:05.060> of<00:02:05.180> view<00:02:05.390> and<00:02:05.860> Katniss
