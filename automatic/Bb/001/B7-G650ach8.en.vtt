00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
as you loosen all these nuts these lug

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.010 
as you loosen all these nuts these lug
nuts<00:00:42.690> but<00:00:43.440> don't<00:00:43.680> take<00:00:43.890> them<00:00:44.040> all<00:00:44.129> the<00:00:44.250> way<00:00:44.399> off

you<00:00:46.020> loosen<00:00:46.379> these<00:00:46.500> up<00:00:46.559> then<00:00:47.520> you<00:00:47.640> get<00:00:47.760> a<00:00:47.789> nice

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
you loosen these up then you get a nice

you loosen these up then you get a nice
big<00:00:48.239> hammer<00:00:48.510> and<00:00:48.600> you<00:00:48.780> tap<00:00:49.200> these<00:00:49.440> wedges

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
big hammer and you tap these wedges

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:51.860

until you break them free and when

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.500 
until you break them free and when
they're<00:00:52.020> all<00:00:52.199> free<00:00:52.940> then<00:00:53.940> you<00:00:54.059> can<00:00:54.210> take<00:00:54.360> the

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
lug nuts off and take the wheel off this

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.049 
lug nuts off and take the wheel off this
one's<00:00:57.480> not<00:00:57.660> a<00:00:57.719> split<00:00:58.140> rim<00:00:58.579> the<00:00:59.579> split<00:00:59.850> rims

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
one's not a split rim the split rims

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.990 
one's not a split rim the split rims
have<00:01:00.239> this<00:01:00.449> have<00:01:00.840> a<00:01:00.870> ring<00:01:01.370> they<00:01:02.370> go<00:01:02.550> around<00:01:02.699> the

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
have this have a ring they go around the

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.980 
have this have a ring they go around the
perimeter<00:01:03.210> I<00:01:03.719> like<00:01:04.439> my<00:01:04.559> back<00:01:04.769> tires<00:01:05.100> are<00:01:05.990> split

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
perimeter I like my back tires are split

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:14.450 
perimeter I like my back tires are split
rim<00:01:07.260> yeah<00:01:07.680> the<00:01:08.159> Rings<00:01:08.850> on<00:01:09.090> the<00:01:09.240> inside<00:01:13.460> let's

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
rim yeah the Rings on the inside let's

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.340 
rim yeah the Rings on the inside let's
see<00:01:14.700> I<00:01:14.729> think<00:01:15.060> I<00:01:15.119> have<00:01:15.270> a<00:01:15.299> split<00:01:15.689> rim<00:01:15.900> inside

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
see I think I have a split rim inside

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:22.749 
see I think I have a split rim inside
the<00:01:16.590> back<00:01:17.390> yeah<00:01:18.390> you're<00:01:18.900> a<00:01:18.930> split<00:01:19.380> rim<00:01:20.900> yeah

00:01:22.749 --> 00:01:22.759 
the back yeah you're a split rim yeah

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:25.100 
the back yeah you're a split rim yeah
that<00:01:23.759> ring<00:01:24.060> right<00:01:24.299> there<00:01:24.360> that<00:01:24.750> goes<00:01:24.900> all<00:01:25.080> the

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
that ring right there that goes all the

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.590 
that ring right there that goes all the
way<00:01:25.229> around<00:01:25.439> the<00:01:25.740> tire<00:01:26.210> before<00:01:27.210> you<00:01:27.330> remove

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
way around the tire before you remove

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.300 
way around the tire before you remove
one<00:01:27.869> of<00:01:27.900> these<00:01:28.049> tires<00:01:28.350> from<00:01:28.650> the<00:01:28.710> vehicle<00:01:29.100> you

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
one of these tires from the vehicle you

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:30.920 
one of these tires from the vehicle you
should<00:01:29.549> take<00:01:29.790> all<00:01:29.970> the<00:01:30.000> air<00:01:30.329> pressure<00:01:30.630> out<00:01:30.840> of

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
should take all the air pressure out of

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.480 
should take all the air pressure out of
the<00:01:31.020> top<00:01:31.170> of<00:01:31.290> this<00:01:31.380> tire<00:01:31.680> here<00:01:31.979> has<00:01:32.130> no<00:01:32.340> air

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
the top of this tire here has no air

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.819 
the top of this tire here has no air
pressure<00:01:32.670> that<00:01:33.600> takes<00:01:33.869> the<00:01:34.020> tension<00:01:34.229> off<00:01:34.560> that

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
pressure that takes the tension off that

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:40.450 
pressure that takes the tension off that
ring<00:01:35.100> and<00:01:37.670> prevents<00:01:38.670> any<00:01:38.729> kind<00:01:38.880> of<00:01:39.210> strophic

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:40.460 
ring and prevents any kind of strophic

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:46.190 
ring and prevents any kind of strophic
expects<00:01:41.460> you<00:01:41.579> can<00:01:41.729> see<00:01:41.909> it's<00:01:42.030> loose<00:01:45.200> but

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
expects you can see it's loose but

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.560 
expects you can see it's loose but
anyway<00:01:47.000> you<00:01:48.000> got<00:01:48.149> to<00:01:48.210> take<00:01:48.299> all<00:01:48.420> the<00:01:48.540> air

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
anyway you got to take all the air

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.300 
anyway you got to take all the air
pressure<00:01:48.840> out<00:01:49.020> of<00:01:49.049> the<00:01:49.170> tire<00:01:49.380> otherwise<00:01:50.040> that

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
pressure out of the tire otherwise that

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:51.740 
pressure out of the tire otherwise that
rain<00:01:50.490> could<00:01:50.610> come<00:01:50.790> off<00:01:50.939> the<00:01:51.299> pressure<00:01:51.509> of<00:01:51.689> the

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
rain could come off the pressure of the

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.090 
rain could come off the pressure of the
tire<00:01:51.899> can<00:01:52.079> make<00:01:52.229> that<00:01:52.350> ring<00:01:52.560> come<00:01:52.740> off<00:01:52.860> and

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
tire can make that ring come off and

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.959 
tire can make that ring come off and
I've<00:01:54.000> seen<00:01:54.270> people<00:01:54.630> lose<00:01:55.380> arms<00:01:55.860> lose<00:01:56.790> their

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
I've seen people lose arms lose their

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:00.050 
I've seen people lose arms lose their
heads<00:01:57.590> I've<00:01:58.590> seen<00:01:58.799> it<00:01:58.920> seen<00:01:59.340> a<00:01:59.369> video<00:01:59.700> where<00:01:59.939> it

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
heads I've seen it seen a video where it

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.819 
heads I've seen it seen a video where it
launched<00:02:00.360> a<00:02:00.420> Volkswagen<00:02:00.930> in<00:02:01.020> the<00:02:01.110> air<00:02:01.229> that

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
launched a Volkswagen in the air that

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:04.340 
launched a Volkswagen in the air that
was<00:02:01.920> pretty<00:02:02.100> cool
