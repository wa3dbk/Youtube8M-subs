getting<00:00:24.480> a<00:00:24.570> question<00:00:24.990> from<00:00:25.170> a<00:00:25.320> lot<00:00:25.470> of<00:00:25.619> them

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.609 
getting a question from a lot of them
they<00:00:26.550> know<00:00:26.730> that<00:00:26.970> Windows<00:00:27.300> 10<00:00:27.330> like<00:00:28.109> Windows<00:00:28.500> 8

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
they know that Windows 10 like Windows 8

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:31.730 
they know that Windows 10 like Windows 8
before<00:00:28.980> it<00:00:29.070> includes<00:00:29.550> antivirus<00:00:30.510> right<00:00:30.990> so

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
before it includes antivirus right so

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.260 
before it includes antivirus right so
they<00:00:31.830> wanted<00:00:32.070> to<00:00:32.189> is<00:00:32.399> there<00:00:32.550> any<00:00:32.669> reason<00:00:33.239> to

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
they wanted to is there any reason to

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.920 
they wanted to is there any reason to
put<00:00:33.750> on<00:00:33.870> a<00:00:33.899> third<00:00:34.260> party<00:00:34.620> antivirus<00:00:35.130> client

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
security white paper and you can give

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.959 
security white paper and you can give
them<00:00:43.140> this<00:00:43.350> to<00:00:43.410> bolster<00:00:44.309> what<00:00:44.460> I<00:00:44.520> am<00:00:44.700> about<00:00:44.910> to

that<00:00:53.789> normal<00:00:54.210> people<00:00:54.539> don't<00:00:54.809> do<00:00:56.059> the<00:00:57.059> number

that normal people don't do the number

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.700 
that normal people don't do the number
one<00:00:57.600> thing<00:00:57.899> normal<00:00:58.440> people<00:00:58.739> said<00:01:00.260> that<00:01:01.260> they

one thing normal people said that they

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.590 
one thing normal people said that they
should<00:01:02.190> do<00:01:02.370> for<00:01:02.579> security<00:01:03.120> is<00:01:03.270> running

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
should do for security is running

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.969 
should do for security is running
antivirus<00:01:05.540> in<00:01:06.540> at<00:01:06.960> no<00:01:07.290> point<00:01:07.590> did<00:01:07.770> the

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
antivirus in at no point did the

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:13.660 
antivirus in at no point did the
computer<00:01:08.310> security<00:01:08.790> experts<00:01:09.150> mention<00:01:09.570> that

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:13.670 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:16.039 

it<00:01:14.670> kind<00:01:14.939> of<00:01:15.000> gives<00:01:15.210> you<00:01:15.330> a<00:01:15.360> false<00:01:15.600> sense<00:01:15.930> of

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
it kind of gives you a false sense of

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:20.300 
it kind of gives you a false sense of
security<00:01:17.119> yeah<00:01:18.150> the<00:01:18.479> reason<00:01:19.049> is<00:01:19.320> a<00:01:19.799> couple<00:01:20.220> of

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
security yeah the reason is a couple of

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:21.800 
security yeah the reason is a couple of
things<00:01:20.430> one<00:01:20.670> thing<00:01:20.880> has<00:01:21.030> changed<00:01:21.600> which<00:01:21.780> is

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
things one thing has changed which is

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.230 
things one thing has changed which is
the<00:01:22.290> prevalence<00:01:22.920> of<00:01:23.040> what<00:01:23.220> we<00:01:23.310> call<00:01:23.490> zero-day

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
the prevalence of what we call zero-day

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.260 
the prevalence of what we call zero-day
exploits<00:01:24.840> exploits<00:01:25.320> that<00:01:25.729> spread<00:01:26.729> so<00:01:27.060> fast

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
exploits exploits that spread so fast

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:28.910 
exploits exploits that spread so fast
you<00:01:27.420> know<00:01:27.479> the<00:01:27.600> early<00:01:27.840> days<00:01:28.020> of<00:01:28.170> viruses<00:01:28.770> they

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
you know the early days of viruses they

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.440 
you know the early days of viruses they
spread<00:01:29.310> because<00:01:29.850> somebody<00:01:30.150> gave<00:01:30.270> you<00:01:30.420> a

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
spread because somebody gave you a

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:31.940 
spread because somebody gave you a
floppy<00:01:30.869> disk<00:01:31.229> right

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
floppy disk right

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.609 
floppy disk right
or<00:01:32.369> maybe<00:01:33.119> they<00:01:33.479> emailed<00:01:33.960> you<00:01:34.140> an<00:01:34.259> attachment

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
or maybe they emailed you an attachment

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:37.370 
or maybe they emailed you an attachment
that<00:01:35.040> you<00:01:35.130> opened<00:01:35.579> but<00:01:36.270> increasingly<00:01:37.140> these

that you opened but increasingly these

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.289 
that you opened but increasingly these
viruses<00:01:38.070> spread<00:01:38.340> over<00:01:38.520> the<00:01:38.700> Internet<00:01:39.060> in<00:01:39.210> a

interesting<00:02:41.829> because<00:02:42.099> the<00:02:42.670> security<00:02:43.120> experts

00:02:43.589 --> 00:02:43.599 
interesting because the security experts

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:47.490 
interesting because the security experts
do<00:02:44.440> use<00:02:44.799> antivirus<00:02:45.579> but<00:02:45.819> by<00:02:46.209> in<00:02:46.480> a<00:02:46.599> far<00:02:46.840> less

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:47.500 
do use antivirus but by in a far less

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:50.940 
do use antivirus but by in a far less
proportion<00:02:48.220> than<00:02:48.480> regular<00:02:49.480> people<00:02:50.019> and<00:02:50.290> they

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:50.950 
proportion than regular people and they

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:53.039 
proportion than regular people and they
know<00:02:51.310> that<00:02:51.340> the<00:02:51.700> antivirus<00:02:52.269> isn't<00:02:52.569> protecting

00:02:53.039 --> 00:02:53.049 
know that the antivirus isn't protecting

00:02:53.049 --> 00:02:57.030 
know that the antivirus isn't protecting
them<00:02:53.220> that<00:02:54.220> as<00:02:54.489> much<00:02:54.849> as<00:02:55.120> a<00:02:55.500> normal<00:02:56.500> user<00:02:56.829> might

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.040 
them that as much as a normal user might

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:58.920 
them that as much as a normal user might
think<00:02:57.340> the<00:02:57.549> update<00:02:58.000> is<00:02:58.120> much<00:02:58.329> more<00:02:58.540> important

00:02:58.920 --> 00:02:58.930 
think the update is much more important

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:01.530 
think the update is much more important
and<00:02:59.019> that<00:02:59.140> means<00:02:59.319> updating<00:02:59.769> not<00:02:59.920> just<00:03:00.540> Windows

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:01.540 
and that means updating not just Windows

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:02.910 
and that means updating not just Windows
which<00:03:01.780> now<00:03:02.109> with<00:03:02.290> Windows<00:03:02.590> 10<00:03:02.739> will

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:02.920 
which now with Windows 10 will

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:04.380 
which now with Windows 10 will
automatically<00:03:03.489> update<00:03:03.640> you<00:03:04.090> don't<00:03:04.239> have<00:03:04.329> a

automatically update you don't have a

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:06.119 
automatically update you don't have a
choice<00:03:04.599> you<00:03:04.750> can<00:03:04.780> defer<00:03:05.170> it<00:03:05.319> but<00:03:05.500> that<00:03:06.099> you

00:03:06.119 --> 00:03:06.129 
choice you can defer it but that you

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:14.640 
that's a good idea at least help them

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:16.430 
that's a good idea at least help them
with<00:05:14.760> passwords<00:05:15.240> and<00:05:15.390> help<00:05:15.570> them<00:05:15.780> to

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:16.440

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:17.780 
with passwords and help them to
understand<00:05:16.860> they<00:05:16.950> should<00:05:17.100> never<00:05:17.250> reuse

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:17.790 
understand they should never reuse

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:19.520 
understand they should never reuse
passwords<00:05:18.240> and<00:05:18.660> then<00:05:18.750> they'll<00:05:18.900> say<00:05:19.080> well<00:05:19.230> how

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:19.530 
passwords and then they'll say well how

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:20.540

am I going to remember them and that's

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:22.730 
am I going to remember them and that's
when<00:05:20.700> you<00:05:20.790> say<00:05:20.940> password<00:05:21.360> manager<00:05:21.740> because

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:22.740 
when you say password manager because

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:24.710 
when you say password manager because
reusing<00:05:23.370> passwords<00:05:23.850> is<00:05:24.000> the<00:05:24.150> number<00:05:24.420> four

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:24.720 
reusing passwords is the number four

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:28.720 
reusing passwords is the number four
thing<00:05:25.230> security<00:05:25.860> experts<00:05:26.280> say<00:05:26.370> watch<00:05:26.850> out<00:05:27.120> for

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:28.730 
thing security experts say watch out for

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:30.800 
thing security experts say watch out for
so<00:05:29.730> those<00:05:29.910> are<00:05:30.060> the<00:05:30.150> those<00:05:30.360> are<00:05:30.420> the<00:05:30.540> really

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:30.810 
so those are the those are the really

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:32.840 
so those are the those are the really
