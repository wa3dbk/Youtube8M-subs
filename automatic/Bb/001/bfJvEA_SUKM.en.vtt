00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:09.760
 Hi I am going to optimize the sound quality for the progressive person now Galaxy 

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:14.380
 s looking and optimizing the problem will be one earphone When optimizing 

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:16.570
 It would be a bit different for a person to hear the left key and the right dog. Left luncheon 

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:22.100
 Float * or look dageona ago 

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:25.940
 Hadeoraguyo that l'm still scared now really fit here, so what's Ear 

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:29.390
 And now , the beans are past the cleansed apps. 

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:33.080
 If you set it up now , it's applied to listening to music. 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:38.920
 And then, when you set up the call, 

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:38.920
 Of course, you gotta have the earphones are connected now runs evil doing and I 

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:45.489
 If you go to settings 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:49.750
 In preparation Spring is optimizing the thumb 

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:54.940
 Now I'm going to be the one to attend. 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:58.329
 It's just a little bit out of the way. 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:01:00.740
 As zest chassis so the road at first and Tanga 

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:04.400
 Click Start 

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:09.470
 So now the contents are loaded and captured 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:13.940
 If you listen to a gun, you can hear it well. 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:17.030
 Now the process continues repeatedly cleared, only advanced 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:23.230
 What does the wrong design also two freshwater Well why 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:23.230
 If it is set continuously, it is set several times. 

00:01:23.799 --> 00:01:30.880
 Doegoyo now optimized not followed by the left or right, I do hear the 

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:36.670
 Now the graph appears. 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:39.939
 And then check the sat quality setting. 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:43.959
 If music is forbidden, both are applied. 

00:01:39.939 --> 00:01:46.810
 And if you are using both earphones and you are using one side 

00:01:43.959 --> 00:01:50.170
 It's the way I use it that way. 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:54.790
 Place based businesses are set 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:57.450
 And now this little part is now easy to see insurance is good 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:57.450
 If you finish it 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:07.350
 Yes, it applies. When it is defined this way , 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:11.340
 It is the left and right ends to the person geseo optimize sound quality 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:15.450
 Control the human body as something I just mechanical machines fit the human body now, 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:17.640
 You can tune the opportunity to do so, it decided to release more music that's when 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:19.530
 And then the music comes out . 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:22.220
 And 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:22.220
 On the phone 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:31.170
 The saturating bookstore now has a call tone quality preference setting. 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:32.850
 Now look, you can now see what that time is also optimized selection now 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:36.030
 So even so 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:41.550
 This part also applies to the earphone jungle. 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:47.150
 Uh more for yourself is to hear the sound 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:47.150
 It's more than just a look at how to optimize the problem .
