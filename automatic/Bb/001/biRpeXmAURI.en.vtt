00:00:08.389 --> 00:00:15.450
 it occurred I have with myself 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:17.279
 to pick another chicken and that is 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:20.100
 Very often in life when you are 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:23.310
 say something right then you have here 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:25.500
 the big mouth and write it in 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.689
 the whole world and says I have a fdp 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:31.109
 but I said but said 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:34.260
 if you say something wrong then it has 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:36.000
 of course you shut up as possible and 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.129
 try not to talk about it 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:43.379
 and that's happening pretty fast 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:45.239
 however, my memory became a bin 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:48.480
 Not me, and that's what it's about 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:51.030
 I had in front of the wm in the camera 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:54.750
 said i believe brazil is the wm 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:57.449
 wins and as you most likely 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.379
 my favorite was 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:00.899
 Brazil 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:03.510
 yes, where against germany against yes 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:06.960
 so I thought okay now must now 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:09.150
 otherwise lose the favorit let us 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.220
 ever loses care germany 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.450
 Of course I should or should leave 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.640
 not that I am in there 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.710
 live in germany 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.869
 the guys played outstanding and 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.970
 you too most likely 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:25.040
 have been mine have become mine 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:31.070
 Favorites Brazil from the German 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:37.369
 with 7 1 swept from the square and indeed 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:39.360
 completely correct and therefore 

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:42.210
 huge lohmann the Germans too 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:45.509
 if that comes late and I see 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:48.899
 one that I completely missed 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:54.090
 completely completely wrong and one completely 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:56.310
 thing many also tell me yes times 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.469
 I was there and I was there luiz gustavo 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.930
 and now mainly focused on 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:01.970
 neymar he was the best player on 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:04.910
 in my opinion 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:08.500
 Brazil is and there they said 

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:11.120
 yes, but never no seven gates 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.960
 I think that can be done that way 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:15.380
 not say 

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:19.400
 You can not be on the basis of a player 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:21.920
 say how many gates fall if he does 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:24.320
 is not there or how many gates are not there 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:24.950
 fall for your own team if he 

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:27.260
 there is 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:28.190
 you can not measure that is not 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:30.170
 measurable 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:32.990
 you can say if the player 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:35.630
 injured is the power one makes for example 

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:37.160
 three gates from which they cash or 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:40.220
 if other players is there 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:41.690
 the bdl make so much that they two 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:43.610
 shoot gates themselves 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:45.740
 it never came to say could be the 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:49.040
 subject residue, for example, at the 1 0 

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:51.830
 exactly the one foot would have had and 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:53.480
 then take a board somewhere 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:55.070
 by third and that as there 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:57.170
 turn for Brazil 

00:02:55.070 --> 00:03:00.080
 then the game would have been completely different 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:01.430
 or what I knew clearly Germany was 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:05.120
 vastly superior 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:05.780
 1000 billion times better 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:07.730
 secure 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:10.100
 but what I just want to say 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:14.540
 you can not do it with the help of a player 

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:17.390
 measure what would happen if he were there 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:19.489
 was or was not there or out and so on 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:23.630
 you can not go on and on 

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:24.760
 say in football but I see that me 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:28.820
 was completely wrong 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:31.070
 and to all Germans who are too late 

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:33.380
 yes, congratulations 

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:34.640
 I had to get rid of it because you were us 

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:38.290
 it occurs to me that I make a mistake 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:38.290
 then I say it immediately
