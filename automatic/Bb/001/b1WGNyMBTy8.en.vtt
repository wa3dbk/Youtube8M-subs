you know kind of on the regular lately
one<00:00:10.679> of<00:00:10.800> those<00:00:10.920> being<00:00:11.250> i<00:00:11.550> have<00:00:12.389> to<00:00:12.630> upload<00:00:12.809> only

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
one of those being i have to upload only

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:14.780 
one of those being i have to upload only
one<00:00:13.380> video<00:00:13.620> a<00:00:13.679> day<00:00:13.889> so<00:00:13.950> instead<00:00:14.460> of<00:00:14.519> uploading

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
one video a day so instead of uploading

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.450 
one video a day so instead of uploading
to<00:00:15.030> like<00:00:15.420> I<00:00:15.450> happen<00:00:15.890> sometimes<00:00:16.890> even<00:00:17.160> three<00:00:17.190> in

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
to like I happen sometimes even three in

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.670 
to like I happen sometimes even three in
case<00:00:17.640> something<00:00:17.970> happens<00:00:18.330> that's<00:00:18.539> awesome<00:00:18.990> I

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
case something happens that's awesome I

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.349 
case something happens that's awesome I
can<00:00:20.039> only<00:00:20.100> upload<00:00:20.400> one<00:00:20.670> and<00:00:20.910> the<00:00:20.970> reason<00:00:21.210> why

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
can only upload one and the reason why

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:23.450 
can only upload one and the reason why
is<00:00:21.390> because<00:00:21.449> my<00:00:21.840> bandwidth<00:00:22.230> I've<00:00:23.189> mentioned

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
is because my bandwidth I've mentioned

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.759 
is because my bandwidth I've mentioned
in<00:00:23.730> a<00:00:23.820> video<00:00:24.029> before<00:00:24.180> about<00:00:24.570> my<00:00:24.720> my<00:00:24.869> about<00:00:25.619> my

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
in a video before about my my about my

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:28.009 
in a video before about my my about my
bandwidth<00:00:26.130> and<00:00:26.480> I'm<00:00:27.480> getting<00:00:27.660> closer<00:00:27.930> and

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
bandwidth and I'm getting closer and

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:29.630 
bandwidth and I'm getting closer and
closer<00:00:28.199> to<00:00:28.349> my<00:00:28.470> bandwidth<00:00:28.800> now<00:00:29.010> at<00:00:29.550> the

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
closer to my bandwidth now at the

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.759 
closer to my bandwidth now at the
beginning<00:00:30.029> of<00:00:30.119> the<00:00:30.300> month<00:00:30.660> I<00:00:30.900> think<00:00:31.529> there<00:00:31.740> was

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
beginning of the month I think there was

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:33.860 
beginning of the month I think there was
someone<00:00:32.219> on<00:00:32.279> my<00:00:32.550> internet<00:00:32.910> using<00:00:33.360> most<00:00:33.600> of<00:00:33.719> it

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
someone on my internet using most of it

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.100 
someone on my internet using most of it
but<00:00:34.800> you<00:00:35.190> know<00:00:35.219> I<00:00:35.309> still<00:00:35.460> use<00:00:35.880> a<00:00:35.910> lot<00:00:36.059> and<00:00:36.540> a<00:00:37.079> lot

but you know I still use a lot and a lot

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:38.569 
but you know I still use a lot and a lot
of<00:00:37.290> you<00:00:37.410> probably<00:00:37.469> thinking<00:00:38.040> well<00:00:38.280> how<00:00:38.520> is

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
of you probably thinking well how is

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.850 
of you probably thinking well how is
that<00:00:38.760> possible<00:00:39.239> you<00:00:39.420> know<00:00:39.540> well<00:00:40.079> videos<00:00:40.590> are

quite a lot you know one video 1 10 min
video<00:00:43.920> is<00:00:44.190> probably<00:00:44.460> half<00:00:44.760> a<00:00:44.910> gig<00:00:45.120> which<00:00:45.960> when

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
video is probably half a gig which when

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.900 
video is probably half a gig which when
you<00:00:46.289> add<00:00:46.410> it<00:00:46.559> up<00:00:46.649> it<00:00:46.829> seems<00:00:47.070> well<00:00:47.309> that's<00:00:47.520> fine

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
you add it up it seems well that's fine

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.660 
you add it up it seems well that's fine

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
you know 60 videos it's like 30 gigs but

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.069 
you know 60 videos it's like 30 gigs but
it<00:00:50.879> doesn't<00:00:51.120> really<00:00:51.239> work<00:00:51.329> out<00:00:51.629> that<00:00:51.870> way<00:00:52.050> and

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
it doesn't really work out that way and

be it you'd be amazed at how fast you go

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.660 
be it you'd be amazed at how fast you go
through<00:01:12.390> bandwidth<00:01:12.810> if<00:01:13.500> you<00:01:14.040> watch<00:01:14.220> videos<00:01:14.520> in

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
through bandwidth if you watch videos in

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.490 
through bandwidth if you watch videos in
360p<00:01:15.210> compared<00:01:15.780> to<00:01:15.900> if<00:01:15.960> you<00:01:16.049> watch<00:01:16.200> them<00:01:16.380> in

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
360p compared to if you watch them in

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.100 
360p compared to if you watch them in
720p<00:01:17.009> on<00:01:17.700> some<00:01:17.970> videos<00:01:18.270> I<00:01:18.420> like<00:01:18.570> to<00:01:18.720> make<00:01:18.960> some

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
720p on some videos I like to make some

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:20.840 
720p on some videos I like to make some
full<00:01:19.320> screen<00:01:19.619> and<00:01:19.799> watch<00:01:19.920> them<00:01:20.159> you<00:01:20.400> know<00:01:20.520> and

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
full screen and watch them you know and

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.590 
full screen and watch them you know and
that<00:01:21.509> just<00:01:21.540> kills<00:01:22.200> my<00:01:22.439> bandwidth<00:01:22.799> I<00:01:23.420> tried<00:01:24.420> to

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
that just kills my bandwidth I tried to

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.570 
that just kills my bandwidth I tried to
contact<00:01:24.869> my<00:01:25.350> cable<00:01:25.770> company<00:01:25.799> but<00:01:26.310> they<00:01:26.460> are

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
contact my cable company but they are

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.789 
contact my cable company but they are
crap<00:01:26.909> sadly<00:01:27.630> for<00:01:27.659> me<00:01:27.869> they're<00:01:28.170> the<00:01:28.409> only<00:01:28.560> cable

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
crap sadly for me they're the only cable

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.039 
crap sadly for me they're the only cable
company<00:01:29.280> i<00:01:29.310> can<00:01:29.520> get<00:01:29.729> i<00:01:29.909> could<00:01:30.689> probably<00:01:30.840> get

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
company i can get i could probably get

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.649 
company i can get i could probably get
commercial<00:01:31.590> but<00:01:31.799> then<00:01:32.009> and<00:01:32.390> then<00:01:33.390> I<00:01:33.420> won't

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
commercial but then and then I won't

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.289 
commercial but then and then I won't
have<00:01:33.750> a<00:01:33.869> bandwidth<00:01:34.740> limit<00:01:35.040> but<00:01:35.189> then<00:01:35.430> I'd<00:01:36.240> have

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
have a bandwidth limit but then I'd have

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:39.319 
have a bandwidth limit but then I'd have
slower<00:01:36.840> internet<00:01:36.960> which<00:01:37.590> it<00:01:38.579> and<00:01:38.909> it'd<00:01:39.000> be<00:01:39.210> the

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
slower internet which it and it'd be the

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:42.350 
slower internet which it and it'd be the
same<00:01:39.360> price<00:01:39.720> so<00:01:40.049> I<00:01:40.079> mean<00:01:40.579> it<00:01:41.579> just<00:01:41.729> sucks<00:01:42.060> i

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
same price so I mean it just sucks i

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.270 
same price so I mean it just sucks i
really<00:01:42.990> wish<00:01:43.140> i<00:01:43.170> lived<00:01:43.500> in<00:01:43.710> a<00:01:43.770> place<00:01:43.890> where<00:01:44.220> I

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
could get verizon because if I did I

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.380

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 
Daisy and then zombies that way you're

Daisy and then zombies that way you're
still<00:02:13.110> getting<00:02:13.230> on<00:02:13.500> me

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:15.990 
but and then I guess you'll just get

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:18.380 
but and then I guess you'll just get
zombies<00:02:16.410> every<00:02:16.650> day<00:02:16.800> for<00:02:17.010> a<00:02:17.070> while<00:02:17.250> until<00:02:17.700> the

verizon and then I could live stream
everyday<00:02:41.850> and<00:02:42.450> do<00:02:43.020> whatever<00:02:43.170> I<00:02:43.380> want<00:02:43.620> without

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
having a bandwidth limit and I would be

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:46.880 
having a bandwidth limit and I would be
paying<00:02:45.840> less<00:02:46.110> than<00:02:46.320> what<00:02:46.470> i<00:02:46.500> pay<00:02:46.680> now<00:02:46.860> for

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
paying less than what i pay now for

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:50.780 
paying less than what i pay now for
internet<00:02:47.400> for<00:02:48.150> faster<00:02:48.750> and<00:02:49.020> better<00:02:49.430> it<00:02:50.430> sucks

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
internet for faster and better it sucks

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:53.120 
internet for faster and better it sucks
but<00:02:51.270> you<00:02:51.660> know<00:02:51.690> you<00:02:52.110> you<00:02:52.410> deal<00:02:52.590> with<00:02:52.770> the<00:02:52.860> cards

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.130 
but you know you you deal with the cards

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:54.830 
but you know you you deal with the cards
that<00:02:53.160> are<00:02:53.340> dealt<00:02:53.460> with<00:02:53.670> you<00:02:53.790> and<00:02:54.060> adult<00:02:54.630> to<00:02:54.750> you

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
that are dealt with you and adult to you

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.870 
that are dealt with you and adult to you
and<00:02:55.050> these<00:02:55.830> are<00:02:56.010> the<00:02:56.100> ones<00:02:56.250> that<00:02:56.310> are<00:02:56.460> Delta<00:02:56.760> me

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
and these are the ones that are Delta me

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:59.990 
and these are the ones that are Delta me
so<00:02:57.330> they're<00:02:58.260> not<00:02:58.440> not<00:02:59.010> a<00:02:59.040> blackjack<00:02:59.340> but

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
so they're not not a blackjack but

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.710 
so they're not not a blackjack but
they'll<00:03:00.810> do<00:03:00.990> I<00:03:01.050> guess<00:03:01.350> so<00:03:02.150> zombie<00:03:03.150> high<00:03:03.270> will

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 
they'll do I guess so zombie high will

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:06.530 
they'll do I guess so zombie high will
be<00:03:03.810> out<00:03:03.930> every<00:03:04.200> Wednesday<00:03:04.790> like<00:03:05.790> it<00:03:06.060> has<00:03:06.330> been

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
be out every Wednesday like it has been

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:08.090 
be out every Wednesday like it has been
you<00:03:06.750> know<00:03:06.840> I<00:03:06.870> can<00:03:07.110> still<00:03:07.260> do<00:03:07.410> that<00:03:07.530> and<00:03:07.770> that's

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:08.100 
you know I can still do that and that's

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:10.340 
you know I can still do that and that's
like<00:03:08.730> two<00:03:08.940> gigs<00:03:09.210> just<00:03:09.480> on<00:03:09.600> that<00:03:09.720> video<00:03:09.960> and<00:03:10.170> I

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:10.350 
like two gigs just on that video and I

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:11.600 
like two gigs just on that video and I

i paid $125 extra a month to get another

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:32.350 
i paid $125 extra a month to get another
internet<00:04:31.010> line<00:04:31.250> and<00:04:31.610> then<00:04:31.760> when<00:04:31.940> i<00:04:31.970> get<00:04:32.180> close

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:32.360 
internet line and then when i get close

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:34.720 
internet line and then when i get close
to<00:04:32.570> hitting<00:04:32.930> the<00:04:33.170> 250<00:04:33.680> gigabyte<00:04:33.920> bandwidth<00:04:34.520> i

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:34.730 
to hitting the 250 gigabyte bandwidth i

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:36.520 
to hitting the 250 gigabyte bandwidth i
could<00:04:35.270> then<00:04:35.420> switch<00:04:35.690> my<00:04:35.840> computer<00:04:36.230> and<00:04:36.320> stuff

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:36.530 
could then switch my computer and stuff

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:38.830 
could then switch my computer and stuff
over<00:04:36.830> to<00:04:37.010> that<00:04:37.190> but<00:04:38.000> that's<00:04:38.030> you<00:04:38.660> know<00:04:38.720> that's

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:38.840 
over to that but that's you know that's

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:40.660 
over to that but that's you know that's
a<00:04:39.080> lot<00:04:39.260> of<00:04:39.320> money<00:04:39.470> because<00:04:39.920> everybody<00:04:40.580> pay

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:40.670 
a lot of money because everybody pay

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:43.630 
a lot of money because everybody pay
$125<00:04:41.600> should<00:04:41.780> be<00:04:41.980> two<00:04:42.980> hundred<00:04:43.040> fifty<00:04:43.280> dollars

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:43.640 
$125 should be two hundred fifty dollars

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:45.790 
$125 should be two hundred fifty dollars
just<00:04:43.820> to<00:04:43.940> have<00:04:44.000> 500<00:04:44.750> gigabytes<00:04:45.200> of<00:04:45.350> bandwidth

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:45.800 
just to have 500 gigabytes of bandwidth

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:47.920 
just to have 500 gigabytes of bandwidth
I<00:04:46.130> probably<00:04:46.640> wouldn't<00:04:46.970> reach<00:04:47.120> that<00:04:47.450> bandwidth

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:47.930 
I probably wouldn't reach that bandwidth

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:50.560 
I probably wouldn't reach that bandwidth
then<00:04:48.200> but<00:04:48.980> it's<00:04:49.310> really<00:04:49.550> it's<00:04:49.850> really<00:04:50.300> not

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:50.570 
then but it's really it's really not

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:52.300 
then but it's really it's really not
worth<00:04:50.630> it<00:04:50.900> especially<00:04:51.050> since<00:04:51.560> verizon<00:04:51.890> is

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:52.310 
worth it especially since verizon is

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:55.450 
worth it especially since verizon is
only<00:04:52.490> ninety-nine<00:04:53.270> dollars<00:04:53.300> for<00:04:54.310> so<00:04:55.310> much

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:55.460 
only ninety-nine dollars for so much

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:58.600 
only ninety-nine dollars for so much
better<00:04:55.760> and<00:04:56.030> and<00:04:56.450> an<00:04:57.410> unlimited<00:04:57.890> bandwidth<00:04:58.430> so

00:04:58.600 --> 00:04:58.610 
better and and an unlimited bandwidth so

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:01.360 
better and and an unlimited bandwidth so
