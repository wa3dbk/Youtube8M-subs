of cream one at a time until they
evaporate<00:01:17.670> at<00:01:18.420> that<00:01:18.570> point<00:01:18.810> we'll<00:01:18.960> stop<00:01:19.259> and

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
evaporate at that point we'll stop and

medium<00:01:34.140> high<00:01:34.530> heat<00:01:35.180> all<00:01:36.180> right<00:01:36.360> we're<00:01:36.659> about

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
medium high heat all right we're about

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.840 
medium high heat all right we're about
ready<00:01:37.079> for<00:01:37.170> our<00:01:37.470> second<00:01:37.829> cup<00:01:37.979> of<00:01:38.100> cream<00:01:38.340> before

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
ready for our second cup of cream before

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.850 
ready for our second cup of cream before
we<00:01:38.970> do<00:01:39.090> that<00:01:39.299> as<00:01:39.570> you'll<00:01:40.200> notice<00:01:40.409> we've<00:01:40.650> turned

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
we do that as you'll notice we've turned

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:41.960 
we do that as you'll notice we've turned
the<00:01:40.979> heat<00:01:41.159> down<00:01:41.189> quite<00:01:41.640> a<00:01:41.670> bit

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
the heat down quite a bit

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.730 
the heat down quite a bit
now<00:01:42.509> we've<00:01:42.659> already<00:01:42.810> had<00:01:43.049> our<00:01:43.170> first<00:01:43.409> cup<00:01:43.590> of

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
now we've already had our first cup of

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.590 
now we've already had our first cup of
cream<00:01:43.950> in<00:01:44.130> here<00:01:44.310> and<00:01:44.640> you<00:01:45.060> can<00:01:45.180> see<00:01:45.299> that<00:01:45.450> it's

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
cream in here and you can see that it's

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.210 
cream in here and you can see that it's
still<00:01:45.810> boiling<00:01:46.079> away<00:01:46.470> a<00:01:46.500> little<00:01:46.799> bit<00:01:46.950> but<00:01:47.130> it

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
still boiling away a little bit but it

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.100 
still boiling away a little bit but it
has<00:01:47.369> dried<00:01:47.610> out<00:01:47.640> significantly<00:01:48.000> but<00:01:48.689> the

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
has dried out significantly but the

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.200 
has dried out significantly but the
reason<00:01:49.409> for<00:01:49.530> the<00:01:49.649> lower<00:01:49.799> heat<00:01:50.159> is<00:01:50.790> because<00:01:51.090> the

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
reason for the lower heat is because the

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:52.730 
reason for the lower heat is because the
cream<00:01:51.450> will<00:01:51.630> burn<00:01:51.810> much<00:01:52.079> more<00:01:52.320> readily<00:01:52.619> than

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
cream will burn much more readily than

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:58.490 
cream will burn much more readily than
the<00:01:53.070> wine<00:01:53.250> will<00:01:55.729> so<00:01:56.729> in<00:01:57.000> goes<00:01:57.180> our<00:01:57.360> last<00:01:58.049> cup<00:01:58.409> of

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
the wine will so in goes our last cup of

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:03.590 
the wine will so in goes our last cup of
cream<00:02:01.490> and<00:02:02.490> again<00:02:02.759> this<00:02:02.939> isn't<00:02:03.119> something<00:02:03.270> you

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
cream and again this isn't something you

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.240 
cream and again this isn't something you
want<00:02:03.840> to<00:02:03.899> walk<00:02:04.140> away<00:02:04.320> from<00:02:04.619> at<00:02:04.770> this<00:02:04.920> point

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
want to walk away from at this point

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.160 
want to walk away from at this point
because<00:02:05.460> a<00:02:05.549> cream<00:02:06.119> being<00:02:06.450> a<00:02:06.600> dairy<00:02:06.869> product

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
because a cream being a dairy product

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.180 
because a cream being a dairy product
will<00:02:07.670> burn<00:02:08.670> on<00:02:08.940> you<00:02:09.179> so<00:02:09.509> watch<00:02:10.140> your<00:02:10.379> heat<00:02:10.530> keep

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
will burn on you so watch your heat keep

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:12.479 
will burn on you so watch your heat keep
it<00:02:11.370> stirred

00:02:12.479 --> 00:02:12.489 
it stirred

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:15.209 
it stirred
and<00:02:12.609> of<00:02:13.120> course<00:02:13.359> you<00:02:14.349> want<00:02:14.469> to<00:02:14.590> stir<00:02:14.769> too<00:02:15.010> much

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:15.219 
and of course you want to stir too much

00:02:15.219 --> 00:02:19.580 
and of course you want to stir too much
because<00:02:16.209> it<00:02:16.329> does<00:02:16.510> need<00:02:16.689> to<00:02:16.719> reduce<00:02:17.140> on<00:02:17.409> you<00:02:17.560> so

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
because it does need to reduce on you so

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:22.440 
because it does need to reduce on you so
this<00:02:20.590> is<00:02:20.739> our<00:02:20.890> last<00:02:21.459> step<00:02:21.909> of<00:02:22.090> course<00:02:22.269> we'll

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.450 
this is our last step of course we'll

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:26.130 
this is our last step of course we'll
