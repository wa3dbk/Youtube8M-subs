00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:09.150
 well now let's interest objects 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:10.639
 parallel then you will see one who has 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.840
 some small subtleties to understand 

00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:14.040
 so already you see that when we have 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.650
 created a view by one does not necessarily 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.000
 right away the places that active and 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.300
 so the fair activate an elio whose 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.380
 possibly the cutting box is not 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.199
 not necessarily necessary 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.460
 that's pretty interesting we'll see 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:27.930
 that we can cut the model directly 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.230
 with the parallel life I will be able to 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:34.079
 so also take predispositions 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.579
 for pre parametric actually everything 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.960
 just the camera so the gd view of 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.149
 face view from above or just 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.489
 an isometric view and so i'm going 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:42.809
 show view 2d to go to work 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:45.239
 on this parallel life so here we are 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:47.190
 in top view and we went on a 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.440
 front view so then of course we can 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.450
 rename here a double click veil called 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.489
 front view and so we go all 

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:56.160
 simply have several possibilities 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.510
 so the traits here then the gray dot 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.070
 it's just the point target 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.180
 rock the camera exactly as for 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.980
 the classic camera and you have some 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:05.640
 traits that have helped to 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:07.110
 cut the model if you want to zoom in 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.100
 or shrapnel actually we're a little 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.299
 little far maybe you'll be able 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.770
 zoom in by taking the red strokes that 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:14.069
 are on the side that will tighten in 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.779
 get the camera wet and then 

00:01:14.069 --> 00:01:16.510
 can you possibly cut in 

00:01:15.779 --> 00:01:18.100
 the money 

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:20.050
 so of course after you go 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:22.060
 power with the shift key and the 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:23.800
 mouse wheel refocus 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:25.270
 possibly directly also in 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:27.210
 preview your window 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:29.170
 1 it's feasible simply too 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.650
 directly also on the side views 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:33.820
 if you wish, of course 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.990
 then always the same you can 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:36.790
 cut the background too if you 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:39.660
 wish you will be able so 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:41.830
 realized like this your parallel view 

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:43.000
 you can cut into the model too 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:44.470
 if you wish you see that there 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.610
 simply by returning to a wrong 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:49.540
 like that I can cut into the model 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:50.800
 I can of course in addition to this 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:53.290
 automatic cut is created by the 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:55.030
 camera a file is activated a box 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:56.770
 to cut in these cases there the box of 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:58.390
 cut will also cut your currency and 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:01.090
 so you're going to have the opportunity to 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:02.370
 cut your model twice so at 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:04.540
 you to see if you wish or not 

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:05.650
 realized this operation knowing that the 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:06.610
 see that while I also cut to 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:08.590
 the upper portion 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:12.470
 because I guess here's my 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:13.340
 cutting box and maybe a little bit passes 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:14.690
 so you still have the possibility 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:18.080
 to cut in two different ways 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:18.680
 the model and add them up if you 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:20.750
 need it 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:22.040
 one last thing of which of course you 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:22.870
 will be able to make axons at the beginning 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:24.950
 of suez and so on 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:26.480
 it's exactly the same parameters 1 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:28.550
 to move the camera cut off itself 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:30.230
 bring closer by taking course of course so in 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:32.090
 spreading or coming back inward 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:34.640
 the two arts and red that you had in 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:36.230
 top view here besides there I 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:39.020
 wanted to go up here if you want 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:39.710
 zoom in or not last possibility that 

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:42.200
 I can show you too 

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:44.390
 possibly the possibility here in 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:46.190
 the settings of the camera so 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:47.750
 select a rendering size 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:49.120
 and who if I 'm in full hd so that's 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:51.290
 from 1920 to 1080 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:52.940
 I have a resolution whatever happens in 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:54.140
 final result of 72 dots per inch but 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:55.670
 you will see that here we scale 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:56.300
 who appears this is extremely 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:59.360
 interesting 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:01.120
 here we are at 1 57th if I return in 1920 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:02.930
 pixels by 1080 pixels 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:06.040
 that's how the views work 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:06.040
 parallel in 56 5
