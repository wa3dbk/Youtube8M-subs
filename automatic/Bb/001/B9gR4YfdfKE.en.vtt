did something on there something kind of
like<00:00:53.820> almost<00:00:54.270> a<00:00:54.449> Cyberman<00:00:54.989> logo<00:00:55.860> and<00:00:56.219> but<00:00:57.059> it

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
like almost a Cyberman logo and but it

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:58.610 
like almost a Cyberman logo and but it
needed<00:00:57.510> it<00:00:57.719> needed<00:00:58.019> to<00:00:58.110> have<00:00:58.199> something<00:00:58.410> to

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
needed it needed to have something to

00:01:00.549 --> 00:01:00.559 
draw you to it and I think originally

draw you to it and I think originally
these<00:01:01.559> these<00:01:02.160> areas<00:01:02.699> here<00:01:02.730> we're<00:01:03.660> going<00:01:03.780> to

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:03.839 
these these areas here we're going to

00:01:03.839 --> 00:01:07.910 
these these areas here we're going to
light<00:01:04.049> up<00:01:04.850> but<00:01:06.259> somewhere<00:01:07.259> somewhere<00:01:07.770> down

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
light up but somewhere somewhere down

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.850 
light up but somewhere somewhere down
the<00:01:08.100> line<00:01:08.720> it<00:01:09.720> was<00:01:10.080> decided<00:01:10.350> that<00:01:10.590> we<00:01:10.770> were

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
the line it was decided that we were

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.010 
the line it was decided that we were
going<00:01:10.979> to<00:01:11.040> have<00:01:11.759> a<00:01:11.790> have<00:01:12.360> a<00:01:12.390> light<00:01:12.659> there<00:01:12.869> but

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
going to have a have a light there but

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.840 
going to have a have a light there but
this<00:01:13.140> is<00:01:13.409> an<00:01:13.680> aperture<00:01:14.159> that<00:01:14.280> opens<00:01:14.670> and

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
this is an aperture that opens and

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:20.920 
this is an aperture that opens and
closes

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:20.930 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:23.350 

that's<00:01:21.650> the<00:01:21.830> way<00:01:21.950> technology<00:01:22.280> is<00:01:22.640> going<00:01:22.940> you

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:23.360 
that's the way technology is going you

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:26.080 
that's the way technology is going you
know<00:01:23.510> you<00:01:23.570> look<00:01:23.870> at<00:01:24.170> video<00:01:24.920> games<00:01:24.980> you<00:01:25.730> look<00:01:25.940> at

robots or androids and they're all
they're<00:01:36.710> all<00:01:36.740> similar<00:01:37.010> but<00:01:37.220> that's<00:01:37.400> just

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:37.550 
they're all similar but that's just

because that's just the way the
technology<00:01:40.520> is<00:01:40.580> going<00:01:40.790> but<00:01:41.270> it<00:01:41.720> does<00:01:41.960> still

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:42.170 
technology is going but it does still

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:44.500 
technology is going but it does still
have<00:01:42.500> classic<00:01:43.130> cyberman<00:01:43.670> features<00:01:44.180> like<00:01:44.360> the

teardrop eyes and the handlebars we

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:55.630 
teardrop eyes and the handlebars we
slimmed<00:01:47.660> it<00:01:47.810> down<00:01:48.020> quite<00:01:48.350> a<00:01:48.380> lot<00:01:48.740> I<00:01:49.070> mean

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:17.810 
you're always going to find similarities

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:21.300 
you're always going to find similarities
because<00:02:18.260> it's<00:02:18.770> a<00:02:18.950> it's<00:02:19.400> a<00:02:19.520> all<00:02:19.970> place<00:02:20.480> I<00:02:20.720> do<00:02:20.959> but
