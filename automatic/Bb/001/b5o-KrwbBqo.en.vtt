00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.890
 Look at this doctor among Chinese 

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:06.390
 Sports nutritionist and today I came 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:08.360
 tell you about the program 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:13.259
 nutritional personalized pmp 

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:15.690
 developed by me is not about 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:18.180
 conventional consultation program consists 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:20.130
 three months of follow-up where the 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.710
 priority of the program is to reduce 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:25.019
 fat and increase in muscle mass 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:28.170
 the program it is customized because 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:29.970
 he considers metabolic individuality 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:32.880
 so each individual has it's expense 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.380
 the baseline metabolic rate is the 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.050
 the calories it needs to keep 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:39.239
 alive to your organs working before 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.370
 each patient has his or her 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.829
 activities and this needs to be 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.020
 taken into account and work or 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.890
 to study when climbing ladder of 6 each 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.510
 walk 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.850
 then this gaÃºcho of the activities of 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.170
 Sand is considered and hook 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.079
 physical activity 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:57.149
 that is, every conscience has its own 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:00.300
 intensity of training once your 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:02.550
 developed is patients with 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.680
 who practice light activity and 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.450
 simply walk another one 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.490
 more moderate activity one 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.770
 more intense activity then adding 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.900
 these three energy expenditures we have 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.360
 the total energy expenditure that is the 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.400
 The first step of our program is 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.869
 first step as a nutritionist is 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.950
 to calculate how much of my calorie 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:23.250
 concierge garage 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:25.470
 The second step is to calculate the current diet 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.720
 how much it consumes 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:30.600
 calories and carbohydrate proteins 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:33.090
 fat mineral fiber fibers and the 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.880
 third step is to know precisely the 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:38.280
 body composition of our patient or 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.920
 how much culture he has and how much 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:43.860
 lean mass it has the pnp it 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.750
 prioritizes to treat the compartments and not 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:48.960
 simply treat weight 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:52.860
 so the patient actually reflects 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:56.010
 its current composition reflects its 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:58.680
 current diet for composition change 

00:01:56.010 --> 00:02:01.020
 one of those diets is needed and then we 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:03.840
 we work on a diet every month 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:06.360
 because every month a metabolism it changes 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.460
 then the diet it also changed all over 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:14.460
 month then there is no way there is no change 

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:16.860
 of composition make up the cell of 

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:18.150
 fat is characterized by having few 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:20.880
 shopping letters 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:22.490
 so it's a cell that makes little 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:25.560
 cellular respiration 

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:27.360
 consequently it spends little energy 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:29.880
 then the patient who has more fat 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:32.610
 his body composition he consumes 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:34.980
 little energy naturally in energy is 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:38.250
 the calorie that comes from food then is a 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:40.710
 patient that whatever he or she consumes or 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:42.720
 whether it consumes more than the calorie 

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:44.400
 he spend it will gain a weight gain 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:47.130
 it will have a fat gain 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:47.820
 different from the patient who has more mass 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:49.680
 muscular 

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:52.650
 the cells with it is characterized by 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:54.930
 have lots of mitochondria so it does more 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:57.870
 and consume more 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:59.880
 energy, then physiology describes this 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:02.130
 cell as metabolic cell mind 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:04.050
 active is a cell that consumes more 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:06.000
 energy to stay alive 

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:08.610
 so the priority in our program 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.190
 without working fat reduction with 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:13.680
 increasing muscle mass in order 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:16.470
 not only the aesthetic result because 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:18.780
 increasing muscle mass promotes 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:21.209
 improvement of flaccidity as well as 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:22.950
 metabolic result or mass increase 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:24.900
 muscle makes the patient 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:27.030
 really the metabolism 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:29.489
