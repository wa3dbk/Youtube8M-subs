00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
background kind of but this is like a

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.270 
background kind of but this is like a
redone<00:00:55.140> version<00:00:55.170> like<00:00:55.590> he's<00:00:55.800> turned<00:00:56.039> into<00:00:56.160> a

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
an opponent's effect if you needed to on

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.039 
an opponent's effect if you needed to on
your<00:01:50.820> opponent's<00:01:50.880> on<00:01:51.270> the<00:01:51.329> field<00:01:51.540> but<00:01:51.899> also

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
your opponent's on the field but also

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:53.870 
your opponent's on the field but also
you<00:01:52.649> know<00:01:52.799> they'll<00:01:53.070> still<00:01:53.310> be<00:01:53.340> helped<00:01:53.700> in<00:01:53.790> a

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
you know they'll still be helped in a

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.370 
you know they'll still be helped in a
way<00:01:53.970> because<00:01:54.270> other<00:01:54.689> effects<00:01:55.049> won't<00:01:55.170> hurt

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
way because other effects won't hurt

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.080 
way because other effects won't hurt
them<00:01:55.530> but<00:01:55.710> I<00:01:55.770> guess<00:01:56.009> you<00:01:56.460> know<00:01:56.549> just<00:01:56.909> getting

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:10.610 
requires one tune or one more non Tuner
monster<00:03:08.340> so<00:03:09.180> of<00:03:09.299> course<00:03:09.510> it<00:03:10.019> kind<00:03:10.200> of<00:03:10.290> has<00:03:10.349> two

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
monster so of course it kind of has two

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:12.110 
monster so of course it kind of has two
because<00:03:10.829> you<00:03:11.040> know<00:03:11.159> you<00:03:11.220> can<00:03:11.489> only<00:03:11.549> really<00:03:11.909> use

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
because you know you can only really use

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.449 
because you know you can only really use
two<00:03:12.299> monsters<00:03:12.629> to<00:03:12.750> bring<00:03:12.959> this<00:03:13.109> out<00:03:13.319> let's<00:03:14.250> see

00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:14.459 
two monsters to bring this out let's see

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:17.119 
two monsters to bring this out let's see
it<00:03:14.669> is<00:03:14.819> 800<00:03:15.419> attack<00:03:15.690> 1000<00:03:16.590> more<00:03:16.650> no<00:03:16.829> defense

00:03:17.119 --> 00:03:17.129 
it is 800 attack 1000 more no defense

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:18.500 
it is 800 attack 1000 more no defense
and<00:03:17.310> it's<00:03:17.400> effectives<00:03:17.819> when<00:03:18.000> this<00:03:18.120> card<00:03:18.329> sent

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510 
and it's effectives when this card sent

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:19.849 
and it's effectives when this card sent
from<00:03:18.690> the<00:03:18.840> field<00:03:19.019> to<00:03:19.169> the<00:03:19.199> Graveyard<00:03:19.409> all

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:19.859 
from the field to the Graveyard all

00:03:19.859 --> 00:03:22.069 
from the field to the Graveyard all
monsters<00:03:20.430> your<00:03:20.549> opponent<00:03:20.790> controls<00:03:20.970> lose<00:03:21.389> 500

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:22.079 
monsters your opponent controls lose 500

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:25.640 
monsters your opponent controls lose 500
attack<00:03:22.379> so<00:03:23.370> yeah<00:03:23.519> not<00:03:23.790> too<00:03:24.000> bad<00:03:24.180> if<00:03:24.389> a<00:03:24.540> of<00:03:25.260> an

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650 
attack so yeah not too bad if a of an

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:27.469 
attack so yeah not too bad if a of an
effect<00:03:25.949> really<00:03:26.220> I<00:03:26.340> mean<00:03:26.669> whatever<00:03:27.000> on<00:03:27.299> that

00:03:27.469 --> 00:03:27.479 
effect really I mean whatever on that

00:03:27.479 --> 00:03:29.629 
effect really I mean whatever on that
but<00:03:27.720> the<00:03:27.810> coolest<00:03:28.229> part<00:03:28.470> about<00:03:28.500> this<00:03:28.829> is<00:03:29.040> that

00:03:29.629 --> 00:03:29.639 
but the coolest part about this is that

00:03:29.639 --> 00:03:31.969 
but the coolest part about this is that
it<00:03:29.879> is<00:03:29.909> a<00:03:30.359> synchro<00:03:31.139> monster<00:03:31.169> that<00:03:31.530> is<00:03:31.680> also<00:03:31.889> a

00:03:31.969 --> 00:03:31.979 
it is a synchro monster that is also a

00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:33.289 
it is a synchro monster that is also a
tuner<00:03:32.220> we<00:03:32.519> hadn't<00:03:32.760> seen<00:03:32.879> one<00:03:33.000> of<00:03:33.060> those<00:03:33.120> in<00:03:33.239> one

00:03:33.289 --> 00:03:33.299 
tuner we hadn't seen one of those in one

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:34.490 
tuner we hadn't seen one of those in one
I<00:03:33.419> think<00:03:33.540> there's<00:03:33.750> only<00:03:33.810> been<00:03:34.049> two<00:03:34.229> other

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500 
I think there's only been two other

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:36.710 
I think there's only been two other
signature<00:03:35.400> tuner<00:03:36.000> monsters<00:03:36.389> where<00:03:36.540> there's

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:36.720 
signature tuner monsters where there's

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:41.240 
signature tuner monsters where there's
the<00:03:36.959> the<00:03:37.859> tg1<00:03:38.879> the<00:03:39.419> dragonfly<00:03:39.989> and<00:03:40.250> formula

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:41.250 
the the tg1 the dragonfly and formula

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:42.680 
the the tg1 the dragonfly and formula
Synchron<00:03:41.609> so<00:03:41.790> I<00:03:41.849> think<00:03:41.940> this<00:03:42.209> is<00:03:42.359> the<00:03:42.449> third

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:42.690 
Synchron so I think this is the third

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:45.080 
Synchron so I think this is the third
one<00:03:42.930> if<00:03:43.019> I'm<00:03:43.109> not<00:03:43.229> mistaken<00:03:43.590> uh<00:03:43.889> yeah<00:03:44.879> it's

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.090 
one if I'm not mistaken uh yeah it's

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:46.699 
one if I'm not mistaken uh yeah it's
great<00:03:45.449> to<00:03:45.599> see<00:03:45.750> another<00:03:45.959> one<00:03:46.169> first<00:03:46.409> off<00:03:46.590> I

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:46.709 
great to see another one first off I

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:48.619 
great to see another one first off I
haven't<00:03:47.549> been<00:03:47.790> really<00:03:47.940> excited<00:03:48.329> just<00:03:48.479> to<00:03:48.569> see

00:03:48.619 --> 00:03:48.629 
haven't been really excited just to see

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:50.360 
haven't been really excited just to see
synchro<00:03:49.139> monsters<00:03:49.530> been<00:03:49.709> a<00:03:49.739> national<00:03:50.069> synchro

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:50.370 
synchro monsters been a national synchro

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:53.089 
synchro monsters been a national synchro
tuner<00:03:50.699> is<00:03:51.000> pretty<00:03:51.989> awesome<00:03:52.470> so<00:03:52.680> hopefully

00:03:53.089 --> 00:03:53.099 
tuner is pretty awesome so hopefully

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:55.460 
tuner is pretty awesome so hopefully
maybe<00:03:53.849> in<00:03:54.060> the<00:03:54.120> future<00:03:54.269> more<00:03:54.659> accel<00:03:54.989> synchro

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:55.470 
maybe in the future more accel synchro

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:57.439 
maybe in the future more accel synchro
hopefully<00:03:56.430> it's<00:03:56.549> not<00:03:56.579> too<00:03:56.729> much<00:03:56.939> -<00:03:57.120> more<00:03:57.299> come

00:03:57.439 --> 00:03:57.449 
hopefully it's not too much - more come

00:03:57.449 --> 00:03:59.240 
hopefully it's not too much - more come
on<00:03:57.599> come<00:03:57.750> on<00:03:57.780> me<00:03:57.959> more<00:03:58.109> accel<00:03:58.379> synchro<00:03:58.560> so<00:03:58.859> we

00:03:59.240 --> 00:03:59.250 
on come on me more accel synchro so we

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:00.229 
on come on me more accel synchro so we
didn't<00:03:59.430> get<00:03:59.489> a<00:03:59.549> whole<00:03:59.699> lot<00:03:59.819> of<00:03:59.879> those<00:04:00.060> I<00:04:00.120> don't

- so you know just requires one tune or
one<00:04:15.959> more<00:04:16.139> non<00:04:16.289> Tuner<00:04:16.560> monster<00:04:16.590> so<00:04:17.489> that's

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:17.940 
one more non Tuner monster so that's
