a<00:00:46.620> mr.<00:00:47.129> chipper<00:00:48.020> skateboard<00:00:49.020> printed<00:00:49.590> out

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
a mr. chipper skateboard printed out

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.549 
a mr. chipper skateboard printed out
loads<00:00:50.070> and<00:00:50.850> it's<00:00:51.120> to<00:00:51.420> a<00:00:51.449> four<00:00:51.870> bit<00:00:52.079> stuff

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
loads and it's to a four bit stuff

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.709 
loads and it's to a four bit stuff
together<00:00:52.770> and<00:00:53.190> that<00:00:53.879> works<00:00:54.059> as<00:00:54.239> a<00:00:54.270> really<00:00:54.600> good

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
together and that works as a really good

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:58.220 
together and that works as a really good
template<00:00:55.140> for<00:00:55.379> it<00:00:56.570> so<00:00:57.570> yeah<00:00:57.719> basically<00:00:57.989> you

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
template for it so yeah basically you

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.380 
template for it so yeah basically you
just<00:00:58.260> put<00:00:58.379> that<00:00:58.500> on<00:00:58.670> mark<00:00:59.670> around<00:00:59.879> it<00:01:00.210> with<00:01:00.359> a

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
just put that on mark around it with a

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.149 
just put that on mark around it with a
pencil<00:01:00.800> onto<00:01:01.800> the<00:01:02.370> sheet<00:01:02.760> of<00:01:03.000> marine<00:01:03.390> ply<00:01:03.660> and

00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:04.159 
pencil onto the sheet of marine ply and

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:07.760 
pencil onto the sheet of marine ply and
then<00:01:05.159> cut<00:01:05.430> it<00:01:05.549> out<00:01:05.700> and<00:01:06.350> this<00:01:07.350> is<00:01:07.530> what<00:01:07.680> it

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
then cut it out and this is what it

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.100 
then cut it out and this is what it
should<00:01:07.799> look<00:01:07.979> like<00:01:08.420> but<00:01:09.420> not<00:01:09.630> as<00:01:09.780> flush

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
should look like but not as flush

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.070 
should look like but not as flush
because<00:01:10.439> we've<00:01:10.710> already<00:01:10.890> sanded<00:01:11.220> this<00:01:11.549> one<00:01:12.080> so

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
because we've already sanded this one so

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.450 
because we've already sanded this one so
once<00:01:13.530> you<00:01:13.710> cut<00:01:14.340> it<00:01:14.460> out<00:01:14.580> with<00:01:14.760> the<00:01:14.790> jigsaw<00:01:15.330> you

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:16.460 
once you cut it out with the jigsaw you

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:20.390 
once you cut it out with the jigsaw you
you<00:01:17.460> sand<00:01:17.939> the<00:01:18.330> edges<00:01:18.780> like<00:01:19.500> here<00:01:19.740> to<00:01:20.100> make<00:01:20.220> it

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
you sand the edges like here to make it

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.630 
you sand the edges like here to make it
smooth<00:01:20.700> with<00:01:20.729> a<00:01:22.130> command<00:01:23.130> what<00:01:23.250> they<00:01:23.400> call

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
those the sand is you hold with the disc

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:32.380 
those the sand is you hold with the disc
on<00:01:26.490> the<00:01:26.520> bottom<00:01:27.020> but<00:01:28.020> yeah<00:01:28.259> sander<00:01:29.189> and<00:01:29.400> um

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:35.539 

once<00:01:33.390> you<00:01:33.570> sanded<00:01:34.049> the<00:01:34.110> edges<00:01:34.140> you<00:01:35.009> can<00:01:35.250> get

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
once you sanded the edges you can get

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.640 
once you sanded the edges you can get
onto<00:01:35.700> the<00:01:35.909> deck<00:01:36.119> make<00:01:36.479> it<00:01:36.659> all<00:01:36.780> smooth<00:01:37.200> you

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
onto the deck make it all smooth you

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.520 
onto the deck make it all smooth you
know<00:01:37.680> use<00:01:38.040> the<00:01:38.070> sander<00:01:38.549> to<00:01:38.729> get<00:01:39.600> the<00:01:39.750> curve<00:01:39.990> the

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
know use the sander to get the curve the

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:45.230 
know use the sander to get the curve the
points<00:01:40.950> around<00:01:41.100> it<00:01:41.460> and<00:01:43.909> that's<00:01:44.909> what<00:01:45.149> it

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
points around it and that's what it

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.770 
points around it and that's what it
should<00:01:45.270> look<00:01:45.479> like<00:01:45.540> once<00:01:45.899> you've<00:01:46.049> sanded<00:01:46.350> it

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:47.780 
should look like once you've sanded it

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:50.270 
should look like once you've sanded it
like<00:01:48.780> that<00:01:48.990> and<00:01:49.170> then<00:01:49.560> what<00:01:49.740> we<00:01:49.860> did<00:01:50.070> was<00:01:50.250> we

skateboard trucks on the
and<00:02:11.469> we<00:02:11.620> moved<00:02:11.859> them<00:02:12.099> up<00:02:12.340> so<00:02:12.640> they'd<00:02:12.849> be<00:02:12.939> closer

00:02:13.229 --> 00:02:13.239 
and we moved them up so they'd be closer

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:15.119 
and we moved them up so they'd be closer
to<00:02:13.510> the<00:02:13.599> front<00:02:13.840> so<00:02:14.019> you<00:02:14.049> can<00:02:14.260> do<00:02:14.349> hang<00:02:14.620> tens<00:02:14.920> and

00:02:15.119 --> 00:02:15.129 
to the front so you can do hang tens and

00:02:15.129 --> 00:02:17.819 
to the front so you can do hang tens and
whatever<00:02:15.310> on<00:02:15.609> the<00:02:15.639> board<00:02:15.909> and<00:02:16.620> basically<00:02:17.620> what

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:17.829 
whatever on the board and basically what

00:02:17.829 --> 00:02:20.360 
whatever on the board and basically what
you<00:02:17.889> do<00:02:18.040> is<00:02:18.129> just<00:02:18.310> draw<00:02:18.700> a<00:02:18.730> little<00:02:18.969> red<00:02:19.569> box

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
you do is just draw a little red box

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:23.099 
you do is just draw a little red box
where<00:02:21.370> the<00:02:21.609> holes<00:02:22.090> are<00:02:22.329> in<00:02:22.389> the<00:02:22.569> trucks<00:02:22.900> and

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:23.109 
where the holes are in the trucks and

00:02:23.109 --> 00:02:25.009 
where the holes are in the trucks and
then<00:02:23.200> you<00:02:23.290> just<00:02:23.469> drill<00:02:23.889> put<00:02:24.370> the<00:02:24.459> template<00:02:24.849> on

00:02:25.009 --> 00:02:25.019 
then you just drill put the template on

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:30.629 
then you just drill put the template on
top<00:02:26.019> of<00:02:26.200> your<00:02:26.560> board<00:02:26.769> like<00:02:26.889> this<00:02:28.950> and<00:02:29.950> you

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:30.639 
top of your board like this and you

00:02:30.639 --> 00:02:33.270 
top of your board like this and you
drill<00:02:30.939> straight<00:02:31.329> through<00:02:31.569> to<00:02:31.719> get<00:02:31.870> the<00:02:32.280> truck

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:33.280 
drill straight through to get the truck

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:38.909 
drill straight through to get the truck
holes<00:02:34.170> for<00:02:35.170> the<00:02:35.290> screws<00:02:35.439> and<00:02:37.769> once<00:02:38.769> you've

00:02:38.909 --> 00:02:38.919 
holes for the screws and once you've

00:02:38.919 --> 00:02:41.039 
holes for the screws and once you've
done<00:02:38.950> that<00:02:39.189> you<00:02:39.549> get<00:02:39.760> one<00:02:39.909> of<00:02:39.999> those<00:02:40.090> bigger

00:02:41.039 --> 00:02:41.049 
done that you get one of those bigger

00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:42.929 
done that you get one of those bigger
drill<00:02:41.379> bits<00:02:41.680> that<00:02:41.950> sort<00:02:42.189> of<00:02:42.280> makes<00:02:42.489> the<00:02:42.700> curve

00:02:42.929 --> 00:02:42.939 
drill bits that sort of makes the curve

00:02:42.939 --> 00:02:45.479 
drill bits that sort of makes the curve
around<00:02:43.510> the<00:02:43.629> edge<00:02:43.750> so<00:02:43.780> they<00:02:44.349> sit<00:02:45.159> in<00:02:45.310> there

00:02:45.479 --> 00:02:45.489 
around the edge so they sit in there

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:49.619 
around the edge so they sit in there
nice<00:02:45.669> and<00:02:45.879> flush<00:02:46.829> once<00:02:47.829> you've<00:02:48.069> done<00:02:48.430> that<00:02:48.699> you

00:02:49.619 --> 00:02:49.629 
nice and flush once you've done that you

00:02:49.629 --> 00:02:51.990 
nice and flush once you've done that you
can<00:02:49.780> put<00:02:49.989> your<00:02:50.560> trucks<00:02:50.859> on<00:02:51.099> or<00:02:51.250> before<00:02:51.760> you<00:02:51.849> do

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.000 
can put your trucks on or before you do

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.330 
can put your trucks on or before you do
that<00:02:52.180> you<00:02:52.329> can<00:02:52.480> varnish<00:02:52.900> it<00:02:53.079> but<00:02:53.859> I<00:02:53.889> put<00:02:54.189> my

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.340 
that you can varnish it but I put my

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:55.949 
that you can varnish it but I put my
trucks<00:02:54.639> on<00:02:54.790> and<00:02:54.969> then<00:02:55.060> varnished<00:02:55.480> it<00:02:55.659> just

00:02:55.949 --> 00:02:55.959 
trucks on and then varnished it just

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:57.420 
trucks on and then varnished it just
because<00:02:56.439> I<00:02:56.530> couldn't<00:02:56.769> be<00:02:56.859> bothered<00:02:57.010> taking

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:57.430 
because I couldn't be bothered taking

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:00.869 
because I couldn't be bothered taking
them<00:02:57.519> off<00:02:58.230> but<00:02:59.230> when<00:02:59.590> you<00:02:59.739> varnish<00:03:00.129> it<00:03:00.340> gives<00:03:00.730> a

00:03:00.869 --> 00:03:00.879 
them off but when you varnish it gives a

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:04.890 
them off but when you varnish it gives a
really<00:03:01.569> really<00:03:01.959> nice<00:03:02.139> old-school<00:03:03.010> look<00:03:03.719> so<00:03:04.719> if

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:04.900 
really really nice old-school look so if

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:06.360 
really really nice old-school look so if
that's<00:03:05.079> what<00:03:05.260> you're<00:03:05.469> looking<00:03:05.709> for<00:03:05.949> that's

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:06.370 
that's what you're looking for that's

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:09.030 
that's what you're looking for that's
probably<00:03:07.090> a<00:03:07.150> best<00:03:07.329> option<00:03:07.750> and<00:03:08.530> on<00:03:08.650> the<00:03:08.739> bottom

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:09.040 
probably a best option and on the bottom

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:12.030 
probably a best option and on the bottom
here<00:03:09.069> I<00:03:09.280> put<00:03:09.549> my<00:03:09.730> initials<00:03:10.209> so<00:03:10.719> if<00:03:11.079> I'm<00:03:11.230> wants
