whatnot Jen we assume nowadays that all
of<00:00:37.770> his<00:00:37.829> armors<00:00:38.190> have<00:00:38.370> that<00:00:38.550> stuff<00:00:38.790> built<00:00:39.059> into

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
of his armors have that stuff built into

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:40.880 
of his armors have that stuff built into
it<00:00:39.510> like<00:00:39.629> he<00:00:39.780> just<00:00:39.930> has<00:00:40.020> like<00:00:40.140> one<00:00:40.469> armor<00:00:40.770> that

it like he just has like one armor that
does<00:00:41.040> everything<00:00:41.390> although<00:00:42.390> I<00:00:42.420> still<00:00:42.540> think

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
does everything although I still think

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.959

he<00:00:42.899> uses<00:00:43.469> like<00:00:44.160> the<00:00:44.280> whole<00:00:44.399> Buster<00:00:44.730> and<00:00:44.850> Thor

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
he uses like the whole Buster and Thor

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:46.729 
he uses like the whole Buster and Thor
Buster<00:00:45.270> for<00:00:45.420> that<00:00:45.510> kind<00:00:45.719> of<00:00:45.780> stuff<00:00:45.989> but<00:00:46.680> I

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
Buster for that kind of stuff but I

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.110

uh this one which I believe is called

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:23.479 
uh this one which I believe is called
the<00:02:20.879> proto<00:02:21.269> classic<00:02:21.810> I'm<00:02:22.709> rather<00:02:22.980> fond<00:02:23.340> of

00:02:23.479 --> 00:02:23.489 
the proto classic I'm rather fond of

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:25.399 
the proto classic I'm rather fond of
just<00:02:23.760> because<00:02:24.180> i<00:02:24.510> think<00:02:24.659> the<00:02:24.840> horn<00:02:25.019> things<00:02:25.260> are

00:02:25.399 --> 00:02:25.409 
just because i think the horn things are

00:02:25.409 --> 00:02:28.970 
just because i think the horn things are
kind<00:02:25.590> of<00:02:25.650> funny<00:02:26.090> and<00:02:27.349> you<00:02:28.349> know<00:02:28.440> this<00:02:28.560> is<00:02:28.769> kind

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
kind of funny and you know this is kind

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:30.800 
kind of funny and you know this is kind
of<00:02:29.099> the<00:02:29.159> in-between<00:02:29.909> State<00:02:30.239> between<00:02:30.659> the

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
of the in-between State between the

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:34.369 
of the in-between State between the
classic<00:02:31.260> Iron<00:02:31.500> Man<00:02:31.650> armor<00:02:31.680> and<00:02:32.129> the<00:02:33.379> other

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:50.579 
in the 90s and it it was kind of like a

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:52.729 
in the 90s and it it was kind of like a
redesign<00:02:51.150> of<00:02:51.180> this<00:02:51.510> and<00:02:51.780> that<00:02:51.810> the<00:02:52.230> horns<00:02:52.620> are

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
way too big and I just I didn't care for

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:56.000 
way too big and I just I didn't care for
it<00:02:54.359> but<00:02:54.540> I<00:02:54.629> like<00:02:54.900> this<00:02:55.079> armor<00:02:55.410> I<00:02:55.560> like<00:02:55.890> the

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
it but I like this armor I like the

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:00.160 
it but I like this armor I like the
ridges<00:02:56.430> on<00:02:56.609> on<00:02:56.940> the<00:02:57.150> helmet<00:02:57.560> but<00:02:58.560> uh<00:02:58.670> yeah<00:02:59.670> I

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:00.170 
ridges on on the helmet but uh yeah I

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:02.809 
ridges on on the helmet but uh yeah I
don't<00:03:01.170> know<00:03:01.230> I<00:03:01.260> like<00:03:01.739> it<00:03:01.920> next<00:03:02.519> up<00:03:02.640> is<00:03:02.790> the

00:03:02.809 --> 00:03:02.819 
don't know I like it next up is the

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:06.380 
don't know I like it next up is the
modular<00:03:03.480> which<00:03:04.470> I<00:03:04.590> can<00:03:04.769> really<00:03:04.980> say<00:03:05.400> I<00:03:05.730> like

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390 
modular which I can really say I like

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:07.610 
modular which I can really say I like
the<00:03:06.510> modular<00:03:06.900> armor<00:03:07.170> not<00:03:07.319> because<00:03:07.590> of

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620 
the modular armor not because of

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:09.050 
the modular armor not because of
anything<00:03:07.890> unique<00:03:08.370> or<00:03:08.519> cool<00:03:08.730> about<00:03:08.909> the

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
anything unique or cool about the

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:10.550 
anything unique or cool about the
modular<00:03:09.599> more<00:03:09.780> not<00:03:09.870> to<00:03:09.959> say<00:03:10.079> it's<00:03:10.200> not<00:03:10.349> unique

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
modular more not to say it's not unique

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:12.830 
modular more not to say it's not unique
or<00:03:10.829> cool<00:03:11.010> it<00:03:11.579> is<00:03:11.819> the<00:03:12.030> first<00:03:12.060> armor<00:03:12.599> and<00:03:12.810> I

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840 
or cool it is the first armor and I

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:15.259 
or cool it is the first armor and I
think<00:03:13.019> the<00:03:13.079> only<00:03:13.230> armor<00:03:13.590> to<00:03:13.819> the<00:03:14.819> idea<00:03:15.090> is<00:03:15.239> that

00:03:15.259 --> 00:03:15.269 
think the only armor to the idea is that

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:17.180 
think the only armor to the idea is that
any<00:03:15.690> part<00:03:16.109> of<00:03:16.200> Iron<00:03:16.440> Man's<00:03:16.620> armor<00:03:16.739> can<00:03:17.010> like

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190 
any part of Iron Man's armor can like

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:18.949 
any part of Iron Man's armor can like
come<00:03:17.430> off<00:03:17.639> and<00:03:17.910> be<00:03:18.299> attached<00:03:18.540> like<00:03:18.750> a

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:18.959 
come off and be attached like a

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:21.500 
come off and be attached like a
different<00:03:19.260> type<00:03:19.410> like<00:03:19.709> if<00:03:20.609> he<00:03:20.760> needs<00:03:20.940> like<00:03:21.180> a

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:21.510 
different type like if he needs like a

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:24.610 
different type like if he needs like a
drill<00:03:21.900> arm<00:03:22.109> he<00:03:22.500> could<00:03:22.650> pop<00:03:23.099> off<00:03:23.280> as<00:03:23.519> his<00:03:23.790> uh<00:03:23.849> his

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:24.620 
drill arm he could pop off as his uh his

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:28.460 
drill arm he could pop off as his uh his
glove<00:03:25.620> and<00:03:25.650> pop<00:03:26.099> on<00:03:26.310> like<00:03:26.519> a<00:03:26.549> drill<00:03:26.880> glove<00:03:27.470> and

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:28.470 
glove and pop on like a drill glove and

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:31.099 
glove and pop on like a drill glove and
stuff<00:03:28.739> like<00:03:28.889> that<00:03:29.510> but<00:03:30.510> really<00:03:30.690> the<00:03:30.959> real

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:31.109 
stuff like that but really the real

00:03:31.109 --> 00:03:32.809 
stuff like that but really the real
reason<00:03:31.410> I<00:03:31.440> like<00:03:31.560> this<00:03:31.739> is<00:03:31.889> because<00:03:32.010> this<00:03:32.669> is

00:03:32.809 --> 00:03:32.819 
reason I like this is because this is

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:34.129 
reason I like this is because this is
the<00:03:32.940> arm<00:03:33.090> where<00:03:33.209> he<00:03:33.299> had<00:03:33.450> in<00:03:33.569> the<00:03:33.660> cartoon<00:03:33.989> I

00:03:34.129 --> 00:03:34.139 
the arm where he had in the cartoon I

00:03:34.139 --> 00:03:35.659 
the arm where he had in the cartoon I
was<00:03:34.260> a<00:03:34.319> kid<00:03:34.500> that<00:03:34.739> was<00:03:34.859> my<00:03:35.010> first<00:03:35.220> exposure<00:03:35.489> to

00:03:35.659 --> 00:03:35.669 
was a kid that was my first exposure to

00:03:35.669 --> 00:03:37.069 
was a kid that was my first exposure to
iron<00:03:35.790> man<00:03:36.030> so<00:03:36.540> it's<00:03:36.660> really<00:03:36.750> more<00:03:36.930> of<00:03:37.019> a

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:37.079 
iron man so it's really more of a

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:38.809 
iron man so it's really more of a
nostalgic<00:03:37.650> thing<00:03:37.680> I<00:03:37.950> just<00:03:38.129> like<00:03:38.340> this<00:03:38.549> armor

00:03:38.809 --> 00:03:38.819 
nostalgic thing I just like this armor

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:40.400 
nostalgic thing I just like this armor
because<00:03:38.940> the<00:03:39.569> longest<00:03:39.900> time<00:03:39.930> this<00:03:40.169> was<00:03:40.290> the

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:40.410 
because the longest time this was the

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:42.920 
because the longest time this was the
only<00:03:40.440> Iron<00:03:40.919> Man<00:03:41.069> armor<00:03:41.099> I<00:03:41.430> do<00:03:41.489> the<00:03:42.299> extremist

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930 
only Iron Man armor I do the extremist

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:47.289 
only Iron Man armor I do the extremist
armor<00:03:43.699> which<00:03:44.699> I<00:03:44.970> like<00:03:45.209> for<00:03:45.660> visuals<00:03:46.260> only<00:03:46.949> I

00:03:47.289 --> 00:03:47.299 
armor which I like for visuals only I

00:03:47.299 --> 00:03:49.430 
armor which I like for visuals only I
don't<00:03:48.299> like<00:03:48.449> the<00:03:48.569> idea<00:03:48.690> that<00:03:48.900> the<00:03:49.079> extremist

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:49.440 
don't like the idea that the extremist

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:52.970 
don't like the idea that the extremist
armor<00:03:49.650> actually<00:03:49.980> gives<00:03:50.250> him<00:03:50.459> powers<00:03:51.919> but<00:03:52.919> I

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:52.980 
armor actually gives him powers but I

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:54.020 
armor actually gives him powers but I
love<00:03:53.220> the<00:03:53.340> look<00:03:53.489> I<00:03:53.609> think<00:03:53.699> it's<00:03:53.879> a<00:03:53.910> great

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:54.030 
love the look I think it's a great

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:56.210 
love the look I think it's a great

glad it replaced the armor before it

which was too bulky and the shoulders

00:04:07.169 --> 00:04:10.729 
which was too bulky and the shoulders
were<00:04:07.319> way<00:04:07.500> too<00:04:07.530> big<00:04:08.989> next<00:04:09.989> is<00:04:10.169> the<00:04:10.199> ultimate

00:04:10.729 --> 00:04:10.739

iron<00:04:11.400> man<00:04:11.609> armor<00:04:11.970> which<00:04:12.720> really<00:04:13.379> really<00:04:13.889> grew

00:04:14.059 --> 00:04:14.069 
iron man armor which really really grew

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:15.860 
iron man armor which really really grew
on<00:04:14.099> me<00:04:14.220> when<00:04:14.669> I<00:04:14.730> first<00:04:14.970> saw<00:04:15.209> it<00:04:15.239> I<00:04:15.449> didn't<00:04:15.720> like

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:15.870 
on me when I first saw it I didn't like

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:16.969 
on me when I first saw it I didn't like
it<00:04:16.019> because<00:04:16.079> i<00:04:16.229> think<00:04:16.289> it<00:04:16.530> was<00:04:16.590> aesthetically

00:04:16.969 --> 00:04:16.979 
it because i think it was aesthetically

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:19.939 
it because i think it was aesthetically
pleasing<00:04:17.070> and<00:04:17.729> I<00:04:18.359> I<00:04:18.479> don't<00:04:18.959> know<00:04:19.049> it<00:04:19.530> was<00:04:19.680> very

00:04:19.939 --> 00:04:19.949 
pleasing and I I don't know it was very

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:21.860 
pleasing and I I don't know it was very
not<00:04:20.760> how<00:04:20.970> I<00:04:21.000> thought<00:04:21.239> it<00:04:21.299> should<00:04:21.510> look<00:04:21.630> but

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:21.870 
not how I thought it should look but

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:23.540 
not how I thought it should look but
it's<00:04:22.019> growing<00:04:22.260> on<00:04:22.380> me<00:04:22.440> almost<00:04:22.800> because<00:04:23.340> its

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:23.550 
it's growing on me almost because its

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:25.640 
it's growing on me almost because its
not<00:04:23.700> aesthetically<00:04:24.390> pleasing<00:04:24.479> like<00:04:25.469> there's

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:25.650 
not aesthetically pleasing like there's

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:26.879 
not aesthetically pleasing like there's
a<00:04:25.740> really<00:04:25.919> like<00:04:26.130> kind<00:04:26.280> of<00:04:26.310> gritty

00:04:26.879 --> 00:04:26.889 
a really like kind of gritty

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:28.920 
a really like kind of gritty
stick<00:04:27.159> look<00:04:27.340> to<00:04:27.520> it<00:04:27.610> to<00:04:27.759> me<00:04:27.909> that's<00:04:28.689> kind<00:04:28.840> of

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:28.930 
stick look to it to me that's kind of

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:30.929 
stick look to it to me that's kind of
the<00:04:29.050> point<00:04:29.229> it<00:04:29.469> runs<00:04:29.949> kind<00:04:30.340> of<00:04:30.400> on<00:04:30.490> batteries

00:04:30.929 --> 00:04:30.939 
the point it runs kind of on batteries

00:04:30.939 --> 00:04:32.459 
the point it runs kind of on batteries
and<00:04:31.180> style<00:04:31.360> in<00:04:31.479> the<00:04:31.569> power<00:04:31.780> supply<00:04:32.050> what<00:04:32.319> not

00:04:32.459 --> 00:04:32.469 
and style in the power supply what not

00:04:32.469 --> 00:04:35.550 
and style in the power supply what not
but<00:04:33.039> I<00:04:33.099> love<00:04:33.939> the<00:04:34.150> design<00:04:34.479> I<00:04:34.780> really<00:04:35.199> really<00:04:35.409> do

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:35.560 
but I love the design I really really do

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:38.489 
but I love the design I really really do
um<00:04:35.860> I<00:04:36.249> just<00:04:36.849> think<00:04:37.300> it's<00:04:37.419> a<00:04:37.509> really<00:04:37.719> unique<00:04:38.050> and

00:04:38.489 --> 00:04:38.499 
um I just think it's a really unique and

00:04:38.499 --> 00:04:43.080 
um I just think it's a really unique and
i<00:04:39.419> must<00:04:40.419> say<00:04:40.479> realistic<00:04:41.080> take<00:04:41.289> on<00:04:41.469> it<00:04:41.879> but<00:04:42.879> it's

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:43.090 
i must say realistic take on it but it's

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:44.519 
i must say realistic take on it but it's
just<00:04:43.210> cool<00:04:43.719> looking<00:04:44.080> I<00:04:44.139> mean<00:04:44.289> it's<00:04:44.409> not

00:04:44.519 --> 00:04:44.529 
just cool looking I mean it's not

00:04:44.529 --> 00:04:46.379 
just cool looking I mean it's not
something<00:04:44.770> I<00:04:44.860> want<00:04:45.099> to<00:04:45.189> have<00:04:45.370> in<00:04:45.639> the<00:04:45.669> normal

00:04:46.379 --> 00:04:46.389 
something I want to have in the normal

00:04:46.389 --> 00:04:47.580 
something I want to have in the normal
universe<00:04:46.539> but<00:04:46.990> I<00:04:47.050> think<00:04:47.229> it<00:04:47.289> looks<00:04:47.349> really

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:47.590 
universe but I think it looks really

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:50.369 
universe but I think it looks really
good<00:04:47.830> on<00:04:48.099> top<00:04:49.060> of<00:04:49.090> that<00:04:49.240> i<00:04:49.389> think<00:04:49.449> this<00:04:49.960> armor

00:04:50.369 --> 00:04:50.379 
good on top of that i think this armor

00:04:50.379 --> 00:04:52.230 
good on top of that i think this armor
should<00:04:50.560> have<00:04:50.710> been<00:04:50.830> in<00:04:50.949> the<00:04:51.069> movie<00:04:51.400> as<00:04:51.580> the

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:52.240 
should have been in the movie as the

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:53.820 
should have been in the movie as the
in-between<00:04:52.719> armor<00:04:53.080> like<00:04:53.349> you<00:04:53.499> know<00:04:53.590> there<00:04:53.740> was

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:53.830 
in-between armor like you know there was

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:56.040 
in-between armor like you know there was
the<00:04:54.009> there<00:04:54.340> was<00:04:54.430> there<00:04:54.819> was<00:04:54.909> the<00:04:55.180> big<00:04:55.599> gray<00:04:55.810> one

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:56.050 
the there was there was the big gray one

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:57.689 
the there was there was the big gray one
then<00:04:56.740> there<00:04:56.889> was<00:04:56.919> the<00:04:57.099> silver<00:04:57.430> one<00:04:57.550> and

00:04:57.689 --> 00:04:57.699 
then there was the silver one and

00:04:57.699 --> 00:04:59.640 
then there was the silver one and
there's<00:04:57.819> the<00:04:57.909> gold<00:04:58.120> one<00:04:58.330> over<00:04:59.259> the<00:04:59.349> red<00:04:59.500> and

00:04:59.640 --> 00:04:59.650 
there's the gold one over the red and

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:01.110 
there's the gold one over the red and
gold<00:04:59.770> 1i<00:04:59.979> think<00:05:00.129> would<00:05:00.370> have<00:05:00.460> been<00:05:00.610> cooler<00:05:00.879> if

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:01.120 
gold 1i think would have been cooler if

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:02.580 
gold 1i think would have been cooler if
this<00:05:01.300> was<00:05:01.509> the<00:05:01.539> in-between<00:05:02.050> armor<00:05:02.319> because<00:05:02.409> it

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:02.590 
this was the in-between armor because it

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:03.990 
this was the in-between armor because it
kind<00:05:02.770> of<00:05:02.860> looks<00:05:03.069> halfway<00:05:03.279> between<00:05:03.580> the<00:05:03.759> two

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:04.000 
kind of looks halfway between the two

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.869 
kind of looks halfway between the two
armors<00:05:04.439> maybe<00:05:05.439> that's<00:05:05.590> just<00:05:05.710> me<00:05:05.889> but<00:05:06.099> I<00:05:06.310> really

00:05:06.869 --> 00:05:06.879 
armors maybe that's just me but I really

00:05:06.879 --> 00:05:08.700 
armors maybe that's just me but I really
I<00:05:06.909> really<00:05:07.029> really<00:05:07.449> dig<00:05:07.599> this<00:05:07.719> armor<00:05:08.050> I<00:05:08.169> like

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:08.710 
I really really dig this armor I like

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:10.200 
I really really dig this armor I like
that<00:05:08.740> it<00:05:08.979> has<00:05:09.009> really<00:05:09.340> limited<00:05:09.849> like<00:05:10.090> it

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:10.210 
that it has really limited like it

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:11.429 
that it has really limited like it
doesn't<00:05:10.419> have<00:05:10.509> repulsor<00:05:10.930> rays<00:05:11.080> and<00:05:11.229> stuff

doesn't have repulsor rays and stuff

00:05:11.439 --> 00:05:13.679 
doesn't have repulsor rays and stuff
like<00:05:11.620> all<00:05:12.430> the<00:05:12.490> technology<00:05:13.150> on<00:05:13.270> is<00:05:13.419> very

00:05:13.679 --> 00:05:13.689 
like all the technology on is very

00:05:13.689 --> 00:05:17.309

I think the extremist does an okay job
of<00:05:55.419> updating<00:05:55.539> this<00:05:55.930> but<00:05:56.469> it<00:05:56.529> has<00:05:56.649> like<00:05:56.800> the
