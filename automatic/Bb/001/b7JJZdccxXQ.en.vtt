00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.370
 when someone was talking about the end of the world 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:08.010
 we used to lock him up or laugh at him or 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:08.450
 both things but we never took it in 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.360
 serious 

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:14.340
 maybe we should have done it but I'm 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.470
 anticipating it is better to start with the 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:19.470
 beginning with the kidnapping of desmond 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.990
 mails my son this guy did not have 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:24.330
 ambition or direction or plans for 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.900
 future what I did have was a legacy 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:30.769
 ancestral a legacy that he chose to deny 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:30.769
 it almost cost him his life 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:36.020
 was captured and taken prisoner 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:37.480
 they took it they would say that it could help them 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:40.840
 to find something 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:43.630
 the fruit one of the artifacts that 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:45.579
 we call fragments of the edl remains of 

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:46.090
 millionaire technology spread across the 

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:49.390
 planet 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:52.510
 some hidden others all found 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:55.880
 many dangerous in the hands of a single 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:58.250
 world the same as I had the world 

00:00:55.880 --> 00:01:01.490
 you know them as industries 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:04.070
 abstergo us as the Templars 

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:06.440
 the enemy we have fighting against 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:08.960
 them thousands of years even more if 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:12.230
 you believe the stories of your origins I 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:13.350
 I believe them after all, after seeing 

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:16.770
 true 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:19.020
 that is the beauty and horror of the animus 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.759
 an artifact that allows us to enter 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.829
 the lives of our ancestors and 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:24.929
 to live them has the power to change it 

00:01:22.829 --> 00:01:27.840
 all of showing us history as 

00:01:24.929 --> 00:01:30.539
 it really happened until his creation the 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.939
 victor where day power and molded 

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:36.149
 the truth we intend to change that 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:38.250
 release bodies and minds but we have 

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:39.929
 our limitations and today the 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.630
 Templars are the ones who lead 

00:01:39.929 --> 00:01:44.780
 but it is getting closer to something greater than 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:47.390
 the murderers and the templars 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:49.580
 something bigger than all of us and if 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:51.990
 we did not find a way to stop it in 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:53.740
 a few weeks already cheap 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:57.000
 for all 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:02:00.210
 In the end, everything depends on him 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.460
 of desmond through the spirit discovered 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:04.800
 his origins he explored in the lives of his 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:07.530
 ancestors and reveal their secrets 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:09.570
 after doing that he trained he resorted to 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.700
 another ancestor to get decades of 

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:15.540
 experience in a few days 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:17.340
 it worked that we think we hope but 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:20.160
 soon very soon the deceptions 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:22.620
 this ominous date looming 21 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:24.930
 December 2012 do not know what 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:28.800
 it will happen only that this is where they want 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:31.110
 that we are when he arrives 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:33.350
 they have been guiding us in their own way 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:35.230
 dislocated and frustrating 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:37.930
 those voices of the first civilization 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:40.329
 those who came before 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:42.290
 a race of precursors of immense power 

00:02:40.329 --> 00:02:45.980
 and motivation and certain 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:48.319
 they created the fragments of the event 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:51.349
 this is where they've taken him 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:53.260
 we with him is before the entrance of 

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:56.239
 this place lost so much time ago 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:58.610
 armed with the knowledge of altair and 

00:02:56.239 --> 00:03:01.159
 the elx skills in your hand leads 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:03.709
 the fruit of drinking and we are at 

00:03:01.159 --> 00:03:04.430
 his side ready to support him in everything 

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:07.630
 that we can 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:11.580
 his name is removable 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:11.580
 and it has brought us to the end
