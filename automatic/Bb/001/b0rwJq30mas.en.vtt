00:00:00.829 --> 00:00:04.580
 from February 12 to 28 in February will find the twenty-first Olympic 

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:08.389
 Winter Games in Vancouver, Canada instead of Sega Splendor on January 15 the 

00:00:08.389 --> 00:00:11.079
 official game for the major sporting event 

00:00:11.079 --> 00:00:14.469
 For once you almost want to say if so far the only one 

00:00:14.469 --> 00:00:18.159
 Representative of this genre is the German developer Vorhinein Games 

00:00:18.159 --> 00:00:21.659
 However, he has refused to use the computer this year, which is why Seegers Reinkober 

00:00:21.659 --> 00:00:25.879
 2010 the only alternative now is on the virtual snow slope too 

00:00:25.879 --> 00:00:26.999
 dare 

00:00:26.999 --> 00:00:30.489
 Herlings want to dissuade in the urgently from why I tell them in the 

00:00:30.489 --> 00:00:31.840
 following minutes 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:35.190
 that is a discipline-only word slalom among the real ones do not exist 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.870
 is there any one of the smaller evil 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:41.010
 Currently the teams are available to choose from this unadorned menu 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:41.910
 choose 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.870
 took or character models real athletes, there is as little as 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:48.250
 different levels of difficulty or a career mode they are allowed 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:51.380
 Select sports only individually and play disjointed 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.210
 The ski runs are among the most fun in their disciplines 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:58.350
 because there is a good sense of speed here 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.879
 and unlike the only word Genz colleagues Intersport straighten them out 

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:04.110
 here even opposite the counterparty 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.390
 but with blinkers knows no special maneuvers but 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:09.900
 track on the ideal line 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.210
 The same applies to the downhill with the snowboard 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.340
 8 Hauke ​​the Dorna since about the same route chosen 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:18.340
 sorry, there are not any more available in Vancouver 2010 

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:23.430
 also the ski jump is successful we are asked good home and skill and 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.430
 even the shaky ego-perspective knows how to please 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:35.920
 Far less dynamic the freestyle study with chili or snowboard 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:39.140
 Here is the special Quarter Veitstanz graduate which exciting 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:42.740
 Sounds turns out to be the former simple old icon in the right area 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:43.790
 games 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:46.790
 he has that's pure adrenalin 

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:56.890
 even less successful is the only exciting process 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:00.090
 because the spongy control gives no feedback about when to use the 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.540
 The result of having to turn them in is to regularly board the gang 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.020
 without knowing why 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:09.379
 Gashi foul for the model that only strong by the mini-game Bern 

00:02:09.379 --> 00:02:10.169
 different 

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:13.819
 per year and should thereby be that not with the analog stick but the 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:16.819
 Shoulder buttons it controls controller for whatever reason 

00:02:18.339 --> 00:02:22.309
 in the category catastrophic is the discipline of ice skating where they are on the 

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:25.549
 Pirates in the right rhythm must have summed up Hermann 

00:02:25.549 --> 00:02:29.209
 However, this is virtually impossible because they do not know exactly when the runners 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:32.700
 touching the ice once again put a stop to the lack of backing 

00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:34.509
 through the bill 

00:02:34.509 --> 00:02:37.589
 After all, it is rather rare to fall and if it does 

00:02:37.589 --> 00:02:39.019
 if they are the same anyway 

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:41.409
 and start at the beginning 

00:02:41.409 --> 00:02:45.389
 a little variety promise the 30 divided into three levels of difficulty 

00:02:45.389 --> 00:02:48.749
 Challenge by fulfilling special tasks 

00:02:48.749 --> 00:02:51.579
 For example, helpless snowmen fall too early 

00:02:51.579 --> 00:02:53.809
 to accumulate valuable seconds 

00:02:53.809 --> 00:02:56.809
 or they should drive through certain goals very fast 

00:02:58.429 --> 00:03:01.939
 or at the price run does not fall below a certain speed 

00:03:02.679 --> 00:03:05.619
 the messed control again 

00:03:05.619 --> 00:03:09.219
 you remember his cover 2010 is only for really nerve-racking 

00:03:09.219 --> 00:03:12.329
 Winter sports fans who do not mind that you sub-disciplines 

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:13.469
 really fun 

00:03:13.469 --> 00:03:16.469
 Daum motivation looks different 

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:21.139
 Dornier does not mean that anymore 

00:03:21.139 --> 00:03:25.489
 He advises he would want to make a total objection, especially in multiplayer 

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:28.319
 the fun is not, however, Mercury 2010 

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:31.579
 the control is totally messed up you have no goal at all Beckham knows 

00:03:31.579 --> 00:03:34.249
 not why one has made a small mistake and on the other foams about 

00:03:34.249 --> 00:03:37.969
 outside, the stock price of German Telekom play okay game quite 

00:03:37.969 --> 00:03:40.869
 Nice but that does not mean that I have my suggestion 

00:03:40.869 --> 00:03:43.859
 just spanned from the snow Gescher and do it yourself
