00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:17.490
 hello everyone welcome to my channel 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:20.310
 I loved nothing this time I love you 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:22.939
 show how I make a champurrado of 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.939
 chocolate 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:28.050
 but this but this time I am 

00:00:25.349 --> 00:00:31.050
 doing with milk as you know what can 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:35.340
 do with milk with water or how to combine 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:37.649
 the two things water with good milk I have 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:41.250
 the videos of how to do it with water 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:44.309
 also for likes that there are people who 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:46.860
 it's not that he does not like milk very much 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:49.710
 or it hurts them or just 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.960
 preferences well they have from where 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.879
 choose good what I need look at now 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.620
 here I have what is milk and 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:58.300
 I have heating up 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:00.489
 in fact it is already about to boil you 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:04.050
 I'm going to add what cinnamon is 

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:04.050
 can be added from the beginning 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:09.040
 here I will let you release a little 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:11.120
 of its flavor the cinnamon also change the 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:14.090
 color a little milk 

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:16.940
 and then also good here I have it 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:19.510
 what is the chocolate tablet I'm going to 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:23.320
 add also 

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:24.700
 and I'm going to let it fall apart too 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:27.760
 I say all this can be done from the 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:29.500
 principle flips is already about to 

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:31.420
 boil my milk I have to be 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:35.470
 taking care here stirring because if not 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:38.620
 because it burns you strip and well 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:42.100
 then it tastes like it's burned and it's about to 

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:44.380
 boil what I'll know a little bit what 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:48.010
 that I explain the rest also 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:50.380
 I need what brown sugar is or 

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:53.080
 can use piloncillo also the two 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:56.680
 things are going well for me I also have here what 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:02:01.310
 which is instant masa for tortillas or 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:05.960
 what is said is tortilla dough 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:08.000
 or if you can or if you have the 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:12.350
 or if they have the opportunity to get 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:15.020
 which is tortilla dough that is 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:17.450
 nix is ​​wrong because they can use it 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:20.720
 very well only dissolve it in water 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:22.640
 here I have what is regular milk milk 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:24.610
 this milk that I also have here 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:26.440
 it is regular 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:28.710
 and here I have a little milk 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:28.710
 evaporated 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:35.240
 well I'm going to return to the fire because 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:38.360
 they know that once it boils it's always 

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:42.100
 it is left on a very low heat so that 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:42.100
 do not pull and it will keep going up 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:47.440
 and well 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:49.920
 and right now what I'm going to follow what 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:49.920
 I'm going to do 

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:58.550
 here mixed what is the dough for 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:01.540
 tortillas 

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:01.540
 let's say it like that 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:06.670
 and what a little extra milk 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:09.370
 for me to remove 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:13.770
 and right here I will add what is the 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:17.260
 evaporated milk I'm going to stir this up 

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:19.060
 to later incorporate it here and this goes 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:24.130
 to be what will give you a 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:25.750
 thick consistency to my champurrado and 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:27.180
 Well, I will mention them in the 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:30.730
 previous videos 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:33.260
 I have a video of how to make an atole of 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:37.250
 chocolate nothing more 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:41.689
 and this is the chocolate champurrado 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:44.650
 but made with milk then for me the 

00:03:41.689 --> 00:03:49.400
 difference is that the other one specifies with 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:53.030
 cornstarch and this is with dough for 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:56.959
 tortillas then the consistency of 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:04:01.819
 flavor is very different from both then 

00:03:56.959 --> 00:04:05.030
 Well, I do not know if I'm right 

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:08.150
 or not that is my opinion and good 

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:11.540
 I invite you to try to make both the 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:13.370
 three and see the difference here is already 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:14.900
 boiling the milk as you see from it 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:17.150
 bat was already boiling the only thing that 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:19.190
 I'm waiting is this 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:22.770
 that dissolves well in the bar 

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:24.539
 chocolate and you're ready 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:27.000
 so what I 'm going to do is go 

00:04:24.539 --> 00:04:29.160
 adding a few and at the same time 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:32.790
 go stirring 

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:34.110
 with this shakes or spoon 

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:38.180
 stick 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:40.160
 to avoid lumps 

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:41.780
 here also the voice is made in balls 

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:46.270
 of mass then try that this 

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:46.270
 mixture of the dough is well well beaten 

00:04:46.849 --> 00:04:52.379
 if you can not wait for them 

00:04:49.409 --> 00:04:55.039
 and well, it 's ready, let's go 

00:04:52.379 --> 00:04:55.039
 adding here 

00:04:55.500 --> 00:05:03.230
 I clarify that the milk with which 

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:03.230
 Mix the dough has to be cold 

00:05:05.969 --> 00:05:09.989
 because if you can not catch it directly 

00:05:07.889 --> 00:05:15.319
 the mass if they make it with hot milk or 

00:05:09.989 --> 00:05:15.319
 warm or you can weigh them later then 

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:24.479
 good only let boil 

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:31.690
 and this as long as a little while boiling 

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:34.150
 is that I express more then 

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:37.300
 Until then is when we are going to give 

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:39.250
 that is already well thickened the 

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:46.110
 sugar I'm going to leave it almost the 

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:49.350
 last or at this moment I will try and 

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:51.830
 If you need sugar, I'm going to 

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:51.830
 add more 

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:03.120
 look here it's just starting to 

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:05.370
 boil as soon as you start doing the 

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:07.050
 little bubbles that is boiling and is 

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:09.500
 when it's going to take the consistency of 

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:12.510
 thick as a while is not carried 

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:16.289
 moving it and still not boiled and then 

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:18.869
 then you do not start to go up 

00:06:16.289 --> 00:06:20.480
 but he retired a little bit in what he 

00:06:18.869 --> 00:06:22.960
 low 

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:25.160
 to fire because I had it up 

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:26.440
 only until it boils is the 

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:28.570
 fire 

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:30.400
 and I come back because I want to continue 

00:06:28.570 --> 00:06:32.970
 expressing a little more and I continue 

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:32.970
 stirring 

00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:43.819
 and look before I pass I already 

00:06:40.009 --> 00:06:46.430
 this I tell you and boiled then before 

00:06:43.819 --> 00:06:48.559
 I already tried it and I think if it does 

00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:50.160
 it's a bit sweet as you are 

00:06:48.559 --> 00:06:52.930
 by the veil 

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:56.830
 try it and this 

00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:59.000
 and it is already to your liking if you want to add 

00:06:56.830 --> 00:07:01.400
 the little house 

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:04.639
 of sugar 

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:06.110
 and if not then they leave it like that but for me 

00:07:04.639 --> 00:07:08.300
 what if de facto 

00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:11.690
 then is tacita I will be the 

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:14.300
 put and be ingredients but like 

00:07:11.690 --> 00:07:16.669
 I tell them to try and if they are made 

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:18.740
 it's fine if you do not like it very sweet what 

00:07:16.669 --> 00:07:21.350
 they leave like this 

00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:23.570
 and well good friends this 

00:07:21.350 --> 00:07:26.630
 they are made that if they are made 

00:07:23.570 --> 00:07:28.820
 very concentrated very thick milk very 

00:07:26.630 --> 00:07:31.970
 concentrated in chocolate or I do not know why 

00:07:28.820 --> 00:07:36.110
 is concentrated in milk that's why it's 

00:07:31.970 --> 00:07:37.340
 milk or if it gets thicker you know that 

00:07:36.110 --> 00:07:38.510
 when it cools, it tends to 

00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:40.820
 Express oneself 

00:07:38.510 --> 00:07:43.160
 just add a little water 

00:07:40.820 --> 00:07:44.690
 Relax with a little water and already 

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:47.330
 it will be ready 

00:07:44.690 --> 00:07:49.760
 well then look and serve and then 

00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:53.660
 Look, it's very rich, it 's very concentrated 

00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:55.970
 of milk and then the only thing I did 

00:07:53.660 --> 00:08:00.140
 was to strain it to remove the cinnamon and 

00:07:55.970 --> 00:08:04.340
 some small group that was left out there what 

00:08:00.140 --> 00:08:06.440
 I went through the colander and then 

00:08:04.340 --> 00:08:10.240
 Well, good friends, I hope you like it 

00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:10.240
 let's go to the next video
