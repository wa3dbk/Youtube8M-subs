with us with the zester or the twist
this<00:04:42.830> is<00:04:42.979> what<00:04:43.130> I<00:04:43.160> used<00:04:43.400> to<00:04:43.520> make<00:04:43.639> lemon<00:04:44.030> lime

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:44.330 
this is what I used to make lemon lime

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:46.810 
this is what I used to make lemon lime
twists<00:04:44.840> but<00:04:45.650> just<00:04:45.860> shake<00:04:46.130> it<00:04:46.160> off<00:04:46.400> and<00:04:46.430> get<00:04:46.759> a

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:46.820 
twists but just shake it off and get a

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:49.089 
twists but just shake it off and get a
nice<00:04:47.030> coating<00:04:47.419> in<00:04:47.599> there<00:04:47.810> and<00:04:48.110> then<00:04:48.830> the<00:04:48.949> end

00:04:49.089 --> 00:04:49.099 
nice coating in there and then the end

00:04:49.099 --> 00:04:50.680 
nice coating in there and then the end
result<00:04:49.280> is<00:04:49.580> since<00:04:49.789> you<00:04:49.910> use<00:04:50.060> very<00:04:50.330> little<00:04:50.599> the

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:50.690 
result is since you use very little the

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:53.589 
result is since you use very little the
chocolate<00:04:51.139> you<00:04:51.229> got<00:04:51.349> yourself<00:04:51.710> a<00:04:51.919> reward<00:04:52.910> for

00:04:53.589 --> 00:04:53.599 
chocolate you got yourself a reward for

00:04:53.599 --> 00:04:56.290

to eat it too there you go and then

00:05:00.979 --> 00:05:04.860 
to eat it too there you go and then
we're<00:05:01.820> going<00:05:01.970> to<00:05:02.060> rim<00:05:02.960> the<00:05:03.110> edges<00:05:03.520> with

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:04.870 
we're going to rim the edges with

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:07.029 
we're going to rim the edges with
strawberries<00:05:05.870> but<00:05:06.440> what<00:05:06.590> I<00:05:06.620> want<00:05:06.830> to<00:05:06.889> do<00:05:06.979> is

00:05:07.029 --> 00:05:07.039 
strawberries but what I want to do is

00:05:07.039 --> 00:05:08.710 
strawberries but what I want to do is
I'm<00:05:07.099> just<00:05:07.159> going<00:05:07.400> to<00:05:07.430> kind<00:05:07.639> of<00:05:07.699> put<00:05:08.599> the

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:08.720 
I'm just going to kind of put the

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:10.300 
I'm just going to kind of put the
strawberry<00:05:09.199> juice<00:05:09.470> ease<00:05:09.710> all<00:05:09.919> around<00:05:10.220> the

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:10.310 
strawberry juice ease all around the

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:12.460 
strawberry juice ease all around the
edges<00:05:10.669> so<00:05:11.180> that<00:05:11.210> your<00:05:11.479> initial<00:05:11.930> sip<00:05:12.169> is<00:05:12.289> that<00:05:12.440> a

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:12.470 
edges so that your initial sip is that a

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:14.080 
edges so that your initial sip is that a
strawberry<00:05:12.979> since<00:05:13.580> you<00:05:13.639> probably<00:05:13.849> not<00:05:13.970> going

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:14.090 
strawberry since you probably not going

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:16.990 
strawberry since you probably not going
to<00:05:14.150> sip<00:05:14.389> on<00:05:14.479> top<00:05:14.810> of<00:05:14.990> one<00:05:15.110> of<00:05:15.229> the<00:05:16.000> strawberries

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:17.000 
to sip on top of one of the strawberries

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:17.830 
to sip on top of one of the strawberries
because<00:05:17.180> that<00:05:17.330> would<00:05:17.449> just<00:05:17.479> be<00:05:17.659> a<00:05:17.750> little

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:17.840 
because that would just be a little

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:20.770 
because that would just be a little
weird<00:05:18.139> and<00:05:18.380> the<00:05:19.070> recipe<00:05:19.400> calls<00:05:19.639> for<00:05:19.820> brimming

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:20.780 
weird and the recipe calls for brimming

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:22.659 
weird and the recipe calls for brimming
the<00:05:20.930> glass<00:05:21.229> but<00:05:21.620> since<00:05:21.860> I've<00:05:22.039> never<00:05:22.190> seen<00:05:22.520> what

the glass but since I've never seen what
one<00:05:22.820> looks<00:05:23.090> like<00:05:23.330> finished<00:05:23.690> I<00:05:24.110> figure<00:05:24.830> I'll

00:05:24.999 --> 00:05:25.009 
one looks like finished I figure I'll

00:05:25.009 --> 00:05:27.909 
one looks like finished I figure I'll
literally<00:05:26.199> Rim<00:05:27.199> the<00:05:27.229> glass<00:05:27.440> with

00:05:27.909 --> 00:05:27.919 
literally Rim the glass with

00:05:27.919 --> 00:05:29.230 
literally Rim the glass with
strawberries<00:05:28.370> so<00:05:28.490> that<00:05:28.610> one<00:05:28.759> didn't<00:05:28.909> work<00:05:29.060> but

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:29.240 
strawberries so that one didn't work but

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:30.700 
strawberries so that one didn't work but
we'll<00:05:29.360> throw<00:05:29.539> that<00:05:29.570> in<00:05:29.840> there<00:05:30.020> that<00:05:30.560> way<00:05:30.680> I

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:30.710 
we'll throw that in there that way I

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:32.050 
we'll throw that in there that way I
have<00:05:30.830> a<00:05:30.860> place<00:05:31.070> to<00:05:31.099> actually<00:05:31.490> drink<00:05:31.789> it<00:05:31.849> from
