00:00:04.849 --> 00:00:04.859 
hey guys it's Cambria once again with my

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:08.179 
hey guys it's Cambria once again with my
two<00:00:04.920> month<00:00:05.339> clock<00:00:05.549> update<00:00:06.000> okay<00:00:06.450> so<00:00:07.099> it's<00:00:08.099> been

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:08.189 
two month clock update okay so it's been

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:10.280 
two month clock update okay so it's been
different<00:00:08.519> takes<00:00:08.849> two<00:00:09.030> months<00:00:09.360> I<00:00:09.480> really

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290 
different takes two months I really

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:11.629 
different takes two months I really
haven't<00:00:10.500> been<00:00:10.650> counting<00:00:11.070> like<00:00:11.219> the<00:00:11.400> weeks

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639 
haven't been counting like the weeks

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:14.180 
haven't been counting like the weeks
exactly<00:00:12.210> but<00:00:12.420> I<00:00:12.480> think<00:00:12.509> it's<00:00:12.870> about<00:00:13.190> two

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
exactly but I think it's about two

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.170 
exactly but I think it's about two
months<00:00:14.460> now<00:00:14.490> it<00:00:14.820> is<00:00:14.940> too<00:00:15.059> much<00:00:15.210> okay<00:00:15.750> so<00:00:16.590> um<00:00:17.180> the

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
months now it is too much okay so um the

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.200 
months now it is too much okay so um the
verdict<00:00:18.570> is<00:00:18.720> I<00:00:19.050> love<00:00:19.470> them<00:00:19.770> I<00:00:20.100> absolutely<00:00:20.820> love

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
verdict is I love them I absolutely love

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.540 
verdict is I love them I absolutely love
them<00:00:21.529> I've<00:00:22.529> been<00:00:22.920> playing<00:00:23.279> around<00:00:23.400> with

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
them I've been playing around with

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.310 
them I've been playing around with
different<00:00:23.760> ways<00:00:24.119> of<00:00:24.480> retightening<00:00:25.140> them

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
different ways of retightening them

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.529 
different ways of retightening them
retwisting<00:00:25.890> them<00:00:26.070> all<00:00:26.279> that<00:00:26.550> the<00:00:27.029> first<00:00:27.269> video

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
retwisting them all that the first video

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:28.910 
retwisting them all that the first video
that<00:00:27.599> I<00:00:27.930> posted<00:00:28.260> about<00:00:28.320> my<00:00:28.560> locs

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
that I posted about my locs

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.490 
that I posted about my locs
I<00:00:28.980> had<00:00:29.189> just<00:00:29.220> retwisting<00:00:30.150> them<00:00:30.359> with<00:00:30.750> locking

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
I had just retwisting them with locking

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.280 
I had just retwisting them with locking
gel<00:00:31.679> but<00:00:32.399> I've<00:00:32.700> since<00:00:32.969> decided<00:00:33.300> to<00:00:33.719> interlock

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
gel but I've since decided to interlock

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:34.819 
gel but I've since decided to interlock
my<00:00:34.469> locs

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
my locs

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:37.190 
my locs
I've<00:00:35.670> been<00:00:35.850> doing<00:00:36.210> a<00:00:36.239> little<00:00:36.570> bit<00:00:36.780> of<00:00:36.809> research

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
I've been doing a little bit of research

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.750 
I've been doing a little bit of research
not<00:00:37.440> a<00:00:37.469> whole<00:00:37.680> lot<00:00:37.860> of<00:00:37.890> research<00:00:38.190> on<00:00:38.399> you<00:00:38.640> know

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
not a whole lot of research on you know

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.750 
not a whole lot of research on you know
the<00:00:39.210> methods<00:00:39.600> but<00:00:40.230> I<00:00:40.440> like<00:00:40.739> what<00:00:40.920> I<00:00:40.980> see<00:00:41.489> about

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
the methods but I like what I see about

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.750 
the methods but I like what I see about
interlocking<00:00:42.660> and<00:00:42.899> how<00:00:43.829> easy<00:00:44.100> it<00:00:44.309> is<00:00:44.399> to<00:00:44.579> do

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
interlocking and how easy it is to do

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.360 
interlocking and how easy it is to do
how<00:00:45.690> tight<00:00:45.989> the<00:00:46.140> roots<00:00:46.320> stay<00:00:46.590> because<00:00:47.039> I<00:00:47.160> wash

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
how tight the roots stay because I wash

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.520 
how tight the roots stay because I wash
my<00:00:47.579> hair<00:00:47.789> and<00:00:48.030> wet<00:00:48.600> my<00:00:48.719> hair<00:00:48.899> a<00:00:48.960> lot<00:00:49.170> and<00:00:49.440> I

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
my hair and wet my hair a lot and I

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.760 
my hair and wet my hair a lot and I
don't<00:00:49.590> like<00:00:50.039> the<00:00:50.700> slippage<00:00:51.149> of<00:00:51.770> retwisting

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
don't like the slippage of retwisting

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.450 
don't like the slippage of retwisting
like<00:00:53.309> um<00:00:53.579> just<00:00:54.510> last<00:00:54.899> week<00:00:55.160> before<00:00:56.160> I<00:00:56.190> started

interlocking<00:01:23.070> last<00:01:23.280> week<00:01:23.520> just<00:01:23.729> finger

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
interlocking last week just finger

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.719

interlocking and I only did up to what

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.310 
interlocking and I only did up to what
my<00:01:26.850> finger<00:01:27.150> could<00:01:27.330> fit<00:01:27.540> through<00:01:27.750> on<00:01:28.020> the<00:01:28.200> new

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
my finger could fit through on the new

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.330 
my finger could fit through on the new
growth<00:01:28.530> so<00:01:28.770> I<00:01:30.530> was<00:01:31.530> looking<00:01:31.920> into<00:01:32.070> different

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
growth so I was looking into different

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.310 
growth so I was looking into different
tools<00:01:32.729> I<00:01:32.909> could<00:01:33.090> use<00:01:33.240> and<00:01:33.509> I<00:01:33.869> came<00:01:34.049> across<00:01:34.170> a

last night I decided to tighten with the

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.450 
last night I decided to tighten with the
tool<00:01:54.960> rather<00:01:55.290> than<00:01:55.439> just<00:01:55.710> my<00:01:55.860> fingers<00:01:56.219> to

just loose hair on the ends of my locs
um<00:03:50.699> this<00:03:51.629> is<00:03:51.780> the<00:03:51.900> length<00:03:52.079> of<00:03:52.290> them<00:03:52.639> and

00:03:53.629 --> 00:03:53.639 
um this is the length of them and

00:03:53.639 --> 00:03:55.580 
um this is the length of them and
depending<00:03:54.209> on<00:03:54.419> if<00:03:54.540> I<00:03:54.629> stretch<00:03:54.900> them<00:03:55.049> out<00:03:55.199> or<00:03:55.470> if

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:55.590 
depending on if I stretch them out or if

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:57.409 
depending on if I stretch them out or if
I<00:03:55.680> weigh<00:03:55.859> them<00:03:56.040> shrunken<00:03:56.430> you<00:03:56.609> know<00:03:56.729> the

00:03:57.409 --> 00:03:57.419 
I weigh them shrunken you know the

00:03:57.419 --> 00:03:59.210 
I weigh them shrunken you know the
length<00:03:57.629> will<00:03:57.780> change<00:03:58.019> a<00:03:58.290> little<00:03:58.409> bit<00:03:58.650> so

00:03:59.210 --> 00:03:59.220 
length will change a little bit so

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:01.640 
length will change a little bit so

still working on my edges interlocking

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:10.640 
still working on my edges interlocking
another<00:04:09.479> reason<00:04:09.750> why<00:04:09.840> I<00:04:09.870> really<00:04:09.900> like<00:04:10.229> it<00:04:10.440> is

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:10.650 
another reason why I really like it is

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:15.110 
another reason why I really like it is
the<00:04:11.250> loose<00:04:11.430> hair<00:04:11.669> around<00:04:11.970> my<00:04:12.090> edges<00:04:12.409> that<00:04:14.120> it's

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:15.120 
the loose hair around my edges that it's

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:17.149 
the loose hair around my edges that it's
hard<00:04:15.419> to<00:04:15.599> incorporate<00:04:15.870> into<00:04:16.169> a<00:04:16.289> lock<00:04:16.560> like<00:04:16.799> as

00:04:17.149 --> 00:04:17.159 
hard to incorporate into a lock like as

00:04:17.159 --> 00:04:18.289 
hard to incorporate into a lock like as
far<00:04:17.340> as<00:04:17.400> when<00:04:17.519> I<00:04:17.579> palm<00:04:17.789> roll<00:04:17.970> it<00:04:18.090> it<00:04:18.180> doesn't

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:18.299 
far as when I palm roll it it doesn't

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:20.229 
far as when I palm roll it it doesn't
stay<00:04:18.570> it<00:04:18.840> really<00:04:19.620> stays

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:20.239 
stay it really stays

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:22.629
