00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:48.080 
don't think so I mean I think the

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:50.530 
don't think so I mean I think the
sportsmanship<00:02:48.530> level<00:02:49.070> especially<00:02:50.030> out<00:02:50.360> here

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:50.540 
sportsmanship level especially out here

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:51.970 
sportsmanship level especially out here
on<00:02:50.630> the<00:02:50.720> Elite<00:02:50.990> Series<00:02:51.020> has<00:02:51.500> never<00:02:51.770> really

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980 
on the Elite Series has never really

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:54.990 
on the Elite Series has never really
been<00:02:52.100> better<00:02:52.460> you<00:02:52.730> know<00:02:52.850> as<00:02:52.970> far<00:02:53.180> as<00:02:53.240> guys

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:55.000 
been better you know as far as guys

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.730 
been better you know as far as guys
respecting<00:02:56.000> each<00:02:56.330> other's<00:02:56.690> water<00:02:56.990> and<00:02:57.470> and

00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:57.740 
respecting each other's water and and

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:59.140 
respecting each other's water and and
what<00:02:57.920> they<00:02:58.070> do<00:02:58.130> you<00:02:58.460> know<00:02:58.550> I<00:02:58.580> think<00:02:58.670> a<00:02:58.910> lot<00:02:59.030> of

00:02:59.140 --> 00:02:59.150 
what they do you know I think a lot of

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:01.060 
what they do you know I think a lot of
that<00:02:59.270> has<00:02:59.480> goes<00:02:59.810> by<00:03:00.110> you<00:03:00.530> know<00:03:00.590> everybody<00:03:00.920> has

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:01.070 
that has goes by you know everybody has

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:03.520 
that has goes by you know everybody has
a<00:03:01.100> ramp<00:03:01.400> boat<00:03:01.610> you<00:03:01.850> can<00:03:02.060> see<00:03:02.300> what's<00:03:03.050> going<00:03:03.140> on

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:03.530 
a ramp boat you can see what's going on

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:06.250 
a ramp boat you can see what's going on
and<00:03:03.920> that<00:03:04.130> so<00:03:04.460> I<00:03:04.910> think<00:03:05.630> it's<00:03:05.840> actually<00:03:06.140> better

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:06.260 
and that so I think it's actually better

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.230 
and that so I think it's actually better
than<00:03:06.410> it's<00:03:06.560> ever<00:03:06.650> been<00:03:06.800> you<00:03:07.400> know<00:03:07.520> I<00:03:07.550> really

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:08.240 
than it's ever been you know I really

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:10.510 
than it's ever been you know I really
don't<00:03:08.420> play<00:03:08.810> at<00:03:08.930> this<00:03:09.110> level<00:03:09.170> of<00:03:09.770> our<00:03:09.920> sport<00:03:10.310> we

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:11.870
