00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:10.770
 we will show you how to make one 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:13.800
 confit of shallots is actually a 

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:14.880
 compote of shallots in vain we will crisis 

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:15.090
 and that of thomas first thing to 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.960
 make 

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:21.330
 the emotions of chores there then very 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:26.789
 simple to find our shallots enough 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:27.180
 that's fine we'll boil 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:29.190
 casseroles 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.360
 while christophe has to put a 

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:32.039
 very little serious there I like 

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:34.260
 all types of foie gras ice is 

00:00:32.039 --> 00:00:35.040
 can put some butter oil but 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.420
 as we leave a rise of a little 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.750
 festive and that remains to me of setting of 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.310
 foie gras 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.260
 I heat a little bit of 

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:42.630
 fat goose fat and I'm going to put 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:48.270
 the shallots thoroughly in nicely from 

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:49.260
 self that in what is called suez it 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.970
 must sweat and well swallow shallots 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.200
 it's important from the start to have a 

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:54.300
 cooking the shallots soften 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:56.219
 is really we see him going away 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.870
 without coloring no colors but the 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:59.790
 fog that comes out made the shallot the 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.170
 juice evaporates and the tip is concentrated 

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:03.229
 so we can put one or two small 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.959
 spoons of water to proceed early 

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:08.100
 and their past area and a hint of salt 

00:01:05.959 --> 00:01:10.859
 to 3 because after that will reduce 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.090
 we're going to be a little of a little stick of 

00:01:10.859 --> 00:01:15.149
 channel a little bit of kannad 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:17.130
 how to recover after we will put some 

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:19.729
 raisins that are going to come sweet we're going 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:22.170
 explain why near and we will put 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:27.029
 a small 17.1 pitt star anise 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:28.960
 hockey here we'll be a little trick 

00:01:27.029 --> 00:01:31.060
 of a mill tournament 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:32.409
 it's like salt not our counterpart 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:33.729
 something that will be next 

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:34.990
 wet with the liquids that will 

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:36.430
 reduce for its part not counting the 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:36.970
 series we are very light but these areas 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:38.590
 have for now 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:40.000
 this is to write in late May for 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:40.540
 the moment Egypt you'll see it's 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.210
 almost done 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:45.040
 we will add a little crème de cassis 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:46.750
 by the crème de cassis will take you away 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:48.700
 the flavor the color but also a little 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:50.229
 little sweet side as the grape that 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:52.960
 will soften and allows to redeem the 

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:55.840
 cattle office we will finish with a nice 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:58.060
 green black red the red wine so that's 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:01.240
 not a recipe weigh a name it's a 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:04.060
 recipe really there a little lid 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:05.649
 not like that we avoid having too much 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:07.179
 strong for a surprise to make stick 

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:09.160
 children's shallots and burnt kinds 

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:10.509
 understood so they are very sweet a 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:12.400
 town hall it's over 45 minutes an hour 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:13.959
 minimum and after you go see on 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:16.180
 open the cover confreres they had 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:18.160
 eventually his needs and that's 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:20.470
 simple it's good it can be eaten warm 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.970
 cold part that's the foie gras it's 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:24.220
 serious and that terrines all 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:25.450
 deli meats it's too good we can 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:28.030
 also to pass by and charles by the 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:30.010
 onions with ego 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:32.080
 so because it's cooked and a truck 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:33.820
 the wine reduces the shallots are 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:36.160
 really sip of wine and energy 

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:38.320
 all in blackcurrant cream there is some 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:40.049
 very hot and very very deep thing 

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:42.519
 in color and very bright very visual 

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:43.510
 then we will get the arbor and the 

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:45.820
 way we're going to take it out 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:47.799
 and then here is what is then ready 

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:49.390
 certainly we 'll say but just there that the 

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:51.170
 lime or black to accompany the 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:52.730
 terrines and meat prices 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:54.319
 its evidence and in addition it can be 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:55.670
 keep a week or so 

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:59.140
 fifteen days in the refrigerator in a 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:59.140
 jar hermetic disorders well closed
