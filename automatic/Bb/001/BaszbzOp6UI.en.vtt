00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
cuz of is this other wire here as you

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:57.050 
cuz of is this other wire here as you
can<00:01:54.180> see<00:01:55.009> with<00:01:56.009> this<00:01:56.219> old<00:01:56.460> one<00:01:56.729> it<00:01:56.880> doesn't

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
can see with this old one it doesn't

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.940 
can see with this old one it doesn't
look<00:01:57.329> as<00:01:57.479> sturdy<00:01:57.899> as<00:01:58.140> a<00:01:58.170> wire<00:01:58.500> and<00:01:58.740> it's<00:01:58.890> a

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
look as sturdy as a wire and it's a

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.370 
look as sturdy as a wire and it's a
little<00:01:59.159> bit<00:01:59.280> more<00:01:59.490> messy<00:02:00.049> plus<00:02:01.049> that's<00:02:01.259> not

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
little bit more messy plus that's not

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.499 
little bit more messy plus that's not
the<00:02:01.560> that's<00:02:02.159> not<00:02:02.369> the<00:02:02.490> only<00:02:02.520> cord<00:02:03.060> that's<00:02:03.270> more

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
the that's not the only cord that's more

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.840 
the that's not the only cord that's more
sturdy<00:02:03.960> on<00:02:04.229> it<00:02:04.439> as<00:02:05.189> you<00:02:05.430> can<00:02:05.549> see<00:02:05.700> this

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850

actually looks a little bit better and
where<00:02:07.829> it<00:02:07.920> connects<00:02:08.310> to<00:02:08.479> it<00:02:09.479> looks<00:02:09.750> like<00:02:09.899> it's

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
where it connects to it looks like it's

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:11.760 
where it connects to it looks like it's
a<00:02:10.140> much<00:02:10.319> better<00:02:10.530> connector<00:02:11.430> on

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:11.770 
a much better connector on

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:14.760 
a much better connector on

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:28.120 
colors which is cool so I'll have to

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:29.820 
colors which is cool so I'll have to
fool<00:03:28.300> around<00:03:28.450> with<00:03:28.720> that<00:03:28.990> it'd<00:03:29.290> be<00:03:29.800> really

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:29.830 
fool around with that it'd be really

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:32.190 
fool around with that it'd be really
nice<00:03:30.490> if<00:03:30.670> I<00:03:30.760> can<00:03:30.940> get<00:03:31.090> a<00:03:31.120> white<00:03:31.450> or<00:03:31.600> white<00:03:31.840> for

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:32.200 
nice if I can get a white or white for

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:34.820 
nice if I can get a white or white for
like<00:03:32.320> a<00:03:32.350> freshwater<00:03:32.950> tank<00:03:33.340> because<00:03:33.730> you<00:03:34.630> know

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:34.830 
like a freshwater tank because you know

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:36.930 
like a freshwater tank because you know
that's<00:03:35.830> part<00:03:36.040> of<00:03:36.070> the<00:03:36.190> problem<00:03:36.370> having<00:03:36.730> with

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:36.940 
that's part of the problem having with

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:40.470 
that's part of the problem having with
this<00:03:37.060> module<00:03:37.300> is<00:03:38.370> it's<00:03:39.370> it's<00:03:40.060> light<00:03:40.330> is

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:40.480 
this module is it's it's light is

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:43.020 
this module is it's it's light is
probably<00:03:40.780> around<00:03:41.070> 12,000<00:03:42.070> k<00:03:42.310> color

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:43.030 
probably around 12,000 k color

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:45.570 
probably around 12,000 k color
temperature<00:03:43.570> to<00:03:43.780> 11,000<00:03:44.590> k<00:03:44.740> and<00:03:45.010> really

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:45.580 
temperature to 11,000 k and really

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:48.390 
temperature to 11,000 k and really
that's<00:03:45.760> kind<00:03:46.120> of<00:03:46.240> a<00:03:46.300> high<00:03:47.290> for<00:03:47.740> a<00:03:47.770> freshwater

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:48.400 
that's kind of a high for a freshwater

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:51.990 
that's kind of a high for a freshwater
tank<00:03:48.730> so<00:03:49.240> you<00:03:49.480> might<00:03:50.410> have<00:03:50.560> set<00:03:50.770> some<00:03:51.670> algae

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:52.000 
tank so you might have set some algae

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.650 
tank so you might have set some algae
problems<00:03:52.390> with<00:03:52.570> that<00:03:52.720> so<00:03:53.730> but<00:03:54.730> anyway<00:03:55.120> so<00:03:55.180> it's

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:55.660 
problems with that so but anyway so it's

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:56.940 
problems with that so but anyway so it's
pretty<00:03:55.780> cool<00:03:56.050> that<00:03:56.170> they<00:03:56.290> did<00:03:56.440> that<00:03:56.470> for<00:03:56.620> free

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:56.950 
pretty cool that they did that for free

00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:59.490 
pretty cool that they did that for free
I'll<00:03:57.070> include<00:03:57.520> all<00:03:58.210> the<00:03:58.600> rest<00:03:58.780> of<00:03:58.870> my<00:03:58.960> findings

00:03:59.490 --> 00:03:59.500 
I'll include all the rest of my findings

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:02.940 
I'll include all the rest of my findings
with<00:04:00.630> this<00:04:01.630> in<00:04:01.870> the<00:04:02.080> review<00:04:02.500> that<00:04:02.530> will<00:04:02.830> be

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:02.950 
with this in the review that will be

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:04.350 
with this in the review that will be
coming<00:04:03.160> up<00:04:03.340> so<00:04:03.490> hey<00:04:03.670> guys<00:04:03.880> as<00:04:04.090> you<00:04:04.210> can<00:04:04.240> see

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:09.700 
have it set up on this tank oops

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:11.430 
have it set up on this tank oops
okay<00:04:10.090> yeah<00:04:10.270> now<00:04:10.540> it's<00:04:10.690> definitely<00:04:11.050> on<00:04:11.170> white

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:11.440 
okay yeah now it's definitely on white

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:13.560 
okay yeah now it's definitely on white
okay<00:04:12.100> this<00:04:12.280> is<00:04:12.460> their<00:04:12.640> regular<00:04:13.060> color<00:04:13.270> white

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:13.570 
okay this is their regular color white

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:16.920 
okay this is their regular color white
now<00:04:13.900> like<00:04:14.650> I<00:04:14.770> said<00:04:14.910> the<00:04:15.910> color<00:04:16.060> temperatures<00:04:16.600> a

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:16.930 
now like I said the color temperatures a

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:19.349 
now like I said the color temperatures a
little<00:04:17.410> too<00:04:17.620> high<00:04:17.770> you<00:04:18.220> know<00:04:18.340> it's<00:04:18.489> like<00:04:18.700> 12<00:04:19.060> K

00:04:19.349 --> 00:04:19.359 
little too high you know it's like 12 K

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:21.390 
little too high you know it's like 12 K
or<00:04:19.720> something<00:04:20.109> like<00:04:20.260> that

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:21.400 
or something like that

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:24.630 
or something like that
12,000<00:04:22.360> K<00:04:22.510> rather<00:04:22.780> and<00:04:23.169> it<00:04:24.070> means<00:04:24.370> it's

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:24.640 
12,000 K rather and it means it's

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:25.560 
12,000 K rather and it means it's
usually<00:04:24.790> a<00:04:25.000> little<00:04:25.150> high

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:25.570 
usually a little high

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:27.780 
usually a little high
blue<00:04:25.990> so<00:04:26.620> let's<00:04:26.770> see<00:04:26.890> what<00:04:27.040> happens<00:04:27.400> if<00:04:27.730> we

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:27.790 
blue so let's see what happens if we

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:29.430 
blue so let's see what happens if we
turn<00:04:28.180> on<00:04:28.330> the<00:04:28.450> Blues<00:04:28.690> just<00:04:28.720> just<00:04:29.110> to<00:04:29.230> give<00:04:29.350> you

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:29.440 
turn on the Blues just just to give you

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:33.200 
turn on the Blues just just to give you
a<00:04:29.500> sample<00:04:29.950> of<00:04:30.040> like<00:04:30.280> how<00:04:30.430> this<00:04:30.610> does<00:04:30.820> it<00:04:31.030> so<00:04:31.330> oh

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:33.210 
a sample of like how this does it so oh

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:36.510 
a sample of like how this does it so oh
look<00:04:34.210> at<00:04:34.300> that<00:04:34.330> I<00:04:34.870> could<00:04:35.320> look<00:04:35.980> at<00:04:36.160> that<00:04:36.190> that

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:36.520 
look at that I could look at that that

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:40.800 
look at that I could look at that that
almost<00:04:36.820> looks<00:04:37.030> like<00:04:37.560> 6500<00:04:38.560> K<00:04:38.740> or<00:04:38.890> 6000<00:04:39.700> okay<00:04:40.450> Oh

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:40.810 
almost looks like 6500 K or 6000 okay Oh

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:43.140 
almost looks like 6500 K or 6000 okay Oh
bulb<00:04:41.770> I'm<00:04:42.040> not<00:04:42.220> sure<00:04:42.430> if<00:04:42.490> it's<00:04:42.760> actually<00:04:42.880> gonna

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:43.150 
bulb I'm not sure if it's actually gonna

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:46.440 
bulb I'm not sure if it's actually gonna
act<00:04:43.480> like<00:04:43.810> that<00:04:44.020> but<00:04:45.210> oops

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:46.450 
act like that but oops

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:47.880 
act like that but oops
I<00:04:46.480> know<00:04:46.780> it's<00:04:47.020> going<00:04:47.140> to<00:04:47.200> be<00:04:47.260> incredibly

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:47.890 
I know it's going to be incredibly

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:49.560 
I know it's going to be incredibly
bright<00:04:48.160> for<00:04:48.430> this<00:04:48.520> camera<00:04:49.060> because<00:04:49.300> it's<00:04:49.450> an

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:49.570 
bright for this camera because it's an

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:54.240 
bright for this camera because it's an
LED<00:04:50.580> but<00:04:51.580> see<00:04:51.760> look<00:04:51.970> at<00:04:52.120> that<00:04:52.330> I<00:04:52.630> mean<00:04:53.410> it<00:04:54.040> went

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:54.250 
LED but see look at that I mean it went

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:57.510 
LED but see look at that I mean it went
from<00:04:54.660> this<00:04:55.660> is<00:04:55.840> what<00:04:56.020> it's<00:04:56.170> at<00:04:56.290> now<00:04:56.470> see<00:04:57.220> the

00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:57.520 
from this is what it's at now see the

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:58.680 
from this is what it's at now see the
see<00:04:57.700> look<00:04:57.820> how<00:04:57.910> much<00:04:58.060> blue<00:04:58.330> where<00:04:58.510> it<00:04:58.570> is

00:04:58.680 --> 00:04:58.690 
see look how much blue where it is

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:00.270 
see look how much blue where it is
that's<00:04:58.930> the<00:04:59.080> regular<00:04:59.500> white<00:04:59.740> what<00:05:00.010> it's<00:05:00.160> on

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:00.280 
that's the regular white what it's on

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:03.900 
that's the regular white what it's on
now<00:05:00.520> and<00:05:01.560> again<00:05:02.560> just<00:05:02.620> to<00:05:03.010> show<00:05:03.040> again<00:05:03.550> I'm

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:03.910 
now and again just to show again I'm

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:05.730 
now and again just to show again I'm
turning<00:05:04.420> down<00:05:04.450> the<00:05:04.720> blue<00:05:04.960> see<00:05:05.380> like<00:05:05.500> right

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:05.740 
turning down the blue see like right

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:07.950 
turning down the blue see like right
there<00:05:06.070> that<00:05:06.670> looks<00:05:06.880> like<00:05:07.090> it<00:05:07.210> would<00:05:07.600> almost<00:05:07.750> be

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:07.960 
there that looks like it would almost be

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:11.070 
there that looks like it would almost be
perfect<00:05:08.560> for<00:05:08.710> freshwater<00:05:09.220> so<00:05:09.570> in<00:05:10.570> the<00:05:10.720> review

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:11.080 
perfect for freshwater so in the review

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:13.250 
perfect for freshwater so in the review
I'll<00:05:11.230> deliver<00:05:11.500> my<00:05:11.650> findings<00:05:12.280> for<00:05:12.550> this<00:05:12.760> and

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:13.260 
I'll deliver my findings for this and

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:16.410 
I'll deliver my findings for this and
see<00:05:14.260> how<00:05:14.350> it<00:05:14.560> goes<00:05:14.590> how<00:05:15.100> I<00:05:15.130> mean<00:05:15.550> if<00:05:15.670> this<00:05:16.060> if

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:16.420 
see how it goes how I mean if this if

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:18.950 
see how it goes how I mean if this if
this<00:05:16.930> really<00:05:17.170> unlocked<00:05:17.740> the<00:05:18.070> freshwater

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:18.960 
this really unlocked the freshwater
