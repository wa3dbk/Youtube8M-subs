00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:13.000 

I<00:00:10.480> have<00:00:11.480> always<00:00:11.629> believed<00:00:12.080> from<00:00:12.469> teaching<00:00:12.709> and

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:13.010 
I have always believed from teaching and

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:14.560 
I have always believed from teaching and
from<00:00:13.219> practic<00:00:13.639> practicing<00:00:14.030> the<00:00:14.119> great<00:00:14.299> craft

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:14.570 
from practic practicing the great craft

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:17.680 
from practic practicing the great craft
that<00:00:14.840> you<00:00:15.440> carry<00:00:15.740> the<00:00:16.190> image<00:00:16.580> in<00:00:16.940> a<00:00:17.090> flat<00:00:17.360> sense

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:17.690 
that you carry the image in a flat sense

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:19.480 
that you carry the image in a flat sense
in<00:00:17.840> your<00:00:17.930> short-term<00:00:18.230> visual<00:00:18.680> memory<00:00:18.980> so<00:00:19.280> I

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:19.490 
in your short-term visual memory so I

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:22.000 
in your short-term visual memory so I
think<00:00:20.030> when<00:00:20.540> you<00:00:20.630> look<00:00:20.810> at<00:00:20.960> the<00:00:21.050> old<00:00:21.200> you<00:00:21.890> know

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:22.010 
think when you look at the old you know

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:24.460 
think when you look at the old you know
the<00:00:22.040> old<00:00:22.370> images<00:00:23.000> of<00:00:23.210> great<00:00:23.780> you<00:00:24.350> know

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:24.470 
the old images of great you know

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:26.290 
the old images of great you know
practitioners<00:00:25.130> and<00:00:25.310> schools<00:00:25.820> from<00:00:26.090> this

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:26.300 
practitioners and schools from this

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:28.450 
practitioners and schools from this
country<00:00:26.660> you<00:00:27.260> see<00:00:27.470> that<00:00:27.620> everybody<00:00:27.860> had<00:00:28.250> put

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:28.460 
country you see that everybody had put

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:30.820 
country you see that everybody had put
the<00:00:28.789> paper<00:00:29.030> or<00:00:29.360> the<00:00:29.510> canvas<00:00:29.720> vertically<00:00:30.410> so

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:30.830 
the paper or the canvas vertically so

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:32.740 
the paper or the canvas vertically so
it's<00:00:31.010> perpendicular<00:00:31.400> to<00:00:31.820> their<00:00:32.149> their<00:00:32.570> line

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:32.750 
it's perpendicular to their their line

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:35.229 
it's perpendicular to their their line
of<00:00:32.780> sight<00:00:33.219> which<00:00:34.219> I<00:00:34.399> believe<00:00:34.699> functions<00:00:35.089> like

00:00:35.229 --> 00:00:35.239 
of sight which I believe functions like

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:37.119 
of sight which I believe functions like
a<00:00:35.300> laser<00:00:35.629> beam<00:00:35.929> coming<00:00:36.260> out<00:00:36.469> of<00:00:36.559> your<00:00:36.679> eyes<00:00:36.859> so

00:00:37.119 --> 00:00:37.129 
a laser beam coming out of your eyes so

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:39.069 
a laser beam coming out of your eyes so
what<00:00:37.820> I<00:00:37.850> don't<00:00:38.120> think<00:00:38.359> works<00:00:38.570> for<00:00:38.690> me<00:00:38.929> very

00:00:39.069 --> 00:00:39.079 
what I don't think works for me very

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:41.649 
what I don't think works for me very
well<00:00:39.379> is<00:00:39.559> if<00:00:39.769> I<00:00:39.890> lean<00:00:40.190> the<00:00:40.670> paper<00:00:40.909> back<00:00:41.269> in<00:00:41.510> one

00:00:41.649 --> 00:00:41.659 
well is if I lean the paper back in one

00:00:41.659 --> 00:00:44.439 
well is if I lean the paper back in one
way<00:00:41.809> or<00:00:41.960> another<00:00:42.039> in<00:00:43.039> fact<00:00:43.640> if<00:00:43.850> I<00:00:44.030> were<00:00:44.179> to<00:00:44.300> put

00:00:44.439 --> 00:00:44.449 
way or another in fact if I were to put

00:00:44.449 --> 00:00:46.599 
way or another in fact if I were to put
the<00:00:44.569> paper<00:00:44.809> and<00:00:45.170> the<00:00:45.769> drawing<00:00:46.039> board<00:00:46.339> on<00:00:46.519> a

00:00:46.599 --> 00:00:46.609 
the paper and the drawing board on a

00:00:46.609 --> 00:00:49.239 
the paper and the drawing board on a
flat<00:00:47.089> table<00:00:47.359> it<00:00:47.929> would<00:00:48.260> be<00:00:48.350> amazing<00:00:48.890> how<00:00:49.069> much

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:49.249 
flat table it would be amazing how much

00:00:49.249 --> 00:00:50.950 
flat table it would be amazing how much
the<00:00:49.460> image<00:00:49.760> of<00:00:49.879> the<00:00:49.969> model<00:00:50.120> stretches<00:00:50.809> out

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:50.960 
the image of the model stretches out

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:53.110 
the image of the model stretches out
because<00:00:51.890> I'm<00:00:52.159> carrying<00:00:52.519> this<00:00:52.879> in<00:00:53.030> my

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:53.120 
because I'm carrying this in my

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:54.910 
because I'm carrying this in my
short-term<00:00:53.420> visual<00:00:53.839> memory<00:00:54.170> and<00:00:54.350> for<00:00:54.800> me

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:54.920 
short-term visual memory and for me

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:57.520 
short-term visual memory and for me
proportional<00:00:55.670> drawing<00:00:56.239> is<00:00:56.449> here<00:00:56.839> but<00:00:57.229> it<00:00:57.379> gets

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:57.530 
proportional drawing is here but it gets

00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:59.290 
proportional drawing is here but it gets
stretched<00:00:57.949> out<00:00:58.190> as<00:00:58.370> it<00:00:58.489> gets<00:00:58.819> laid<00:00:58.999> down<00:00:59.149> on

00:00:59.290 --> 00:00:59.300 
stretched out as it gets laid down on

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:02.110 
stretched out as it gets laid down on

today is a very important aspect of

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:27.670 
today is a very important aspect of
drawing<00:01:24.980> the<00:01:25.070> figure<00:01:26.110> also<00:01:27.110> when<00:01:27.560> you're

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:27.680 
drawing the figure also when you're

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:29.260 
drawing the figure also when you're
looking<00:01:27.890> at<00:01:28.010> the<00:01:28.100> model<00:01:28.430> do<00:01:28.940> they<00:01:29.090> do<00:01:29.150> a

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:29.270 
looking at the model do they do a

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:31.900 
looking at the model do they do a
dynamic<00:01:29.840> pose<00:01:30.080> which<00:01:30.590> is<00:01:30.620> also<00:01:31.070> quite<00:01:31.460> varied

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:31.910 
dynamic pose which is also quite varied

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:33.820 
dynamic pose which is also quite varied
from<00:01:32.180> the<00:01:32.270> one<00:01:32.420> they<00:01:32.540> had<00:01:32.720> just<00:01:32.930> done<00:01:33.020> so<00:01:33.800> a

I advise one of my students to draw

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:39.640 
I advise one of my students to draw
first<00:02:37.160> and<00:02:37.430> measure<00:02:37.610> second<00:02:38.180> I'm<00:02:38.350> driven<00:02:39.350> by

first and measure second I'm driven by

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:42.580 
first and measure second I'm driven by
this<00:02:39.920> notion<00:02:40.130> of<00:02:40.490> of<00:02:41.060> drawing<00:02:41.690> enjoying<00:02:42.440> the

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:42.590 
this notion of of drawing enjoying the

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:44.350 
this notion of of drawing enjoying the
drawing<00:02:42.860> process<00:02:43.040> but<00:02:43.940> even<00:02:43.970> more

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:44.360 
drawing process but even more

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:46.270 
drawing process but even more
importantly<00:02:44.810> you<00:02:45.590> need<00:02:45.710> to<00:02:45.830> have<00:02:45.980> something

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:46.280 
importantly you need to have something

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:50.350 
importantly you need to have something
to<00:02:46.640> measure<00:02:46.850> if<00:02:47.120> you<00:02:47.810> have<00:02:48.080> a<00:02:48.350> drawing<00:02:49.360> which

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:50.360 
to measure if you have a drawing which

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:53.980 
to measure if you have a drawing which

and<00:03:15.050> I'm<00:03:15.410> advising<00:03:15.770> drawing<00:03:16.280> first<00:03:16.640> and<00:03:16.940> then

measuring<00:03:17.420> second<00:03:18.020> when<00:03:18.530> you<00:03:18.620> draw<00:03:18.860> first<00:03:18.920> I

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:19.490 
measuring second when you draw first I

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:23.290 
measuring second when you draw first I
think<00:03:20.120> that<00:03:20.360> each<00:03:21.050> person<00:03:21.620> in<00:03:21.740> my<00:03:21.920> room<00:03:22.300> who

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:23.300 
think that each person in my room who

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:25.600 
think that each person in my room who
draws<00:03:23.630> first<00:03:23.660> and<00:03:24.260> measure<00:03:24.410> second<00:03:24.950> measures

just<00:03:25.700> a<00:03:26.060> little<00:03:26.360> bit<00:03:26.480> less<00:03:26.690> every<00:03:27.020> time<00:03:27.260> now

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:27.620 
just a little bit less every time now

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:29.680 
just a little bit less every time now
when<00:03:27.890> I<00:03:27.920> squint<00:03:28.400> my<00:03:28.430> eyes<00:03:28.550> which<00:03:29.270> is<00:03:29.390> another

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:29.690 
when I squint my eyes which is another

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:32.530 
when I squint my eyes which is another
really<00:03:30.290> important<00:03:30.860> aspect<00:03:31.280> to<00:03:31.670> doing<00:03:32.420> this

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:32.540 
really important aspect to doing this

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:34.990 
really important aspect to doing this
that<00:03:32.780> needs<00:03:32.959> to<00:03:33.110> be<00:03:33.230> said<00:03:33.610> squinting<00:03:34.610> it's

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:35.000 
that needs to be said squinting it's

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.360 
that needs to be said squinting it's
like<00:03:35.240> the<00:03:35.390> plumb<00:03:35.600> line<00:03:35.630> so<00:03:36.260> fundamental<00:03:36.890> but

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:37.370 
like the plumb line so fundamental but

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:40.570 
like the plumb line so fundamental but
so<00:03:37.580> necessary<00:03:38.470> when<00:03:39.470> I<00:03:39.500> squint<00:03:39.830> my<00:03:39.860> eyes<00:03:39.980> I<00:03:40.370> can

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:40.580 
so necessary when I squint my eyes I can

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:43.090 
so necessary when I squint my eyes I can
see<00:03:40.880> much<00:03:41.330> more<00:03:41.390> clearly<00:03:41.630> what's<00:03:42.620> going<00:03:42.920> on

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:43.100 
see much more clearly what's going on

down on it in fact my purpose here is
not<00:03:57.080> to<00:03:57.320> shade<00:03:57.739> it's<00:03:58.100> simply<00:03:58.520> to<00:03:58.610> separate

00:03:59.170 --> 00:03:59.180 
not to shade it's simply to separate

that separation in fact I think you'll

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:08.140 
that separation in fact I think you'll
find<00:04:06.110> that<00:04:06.230> by<00:04:06.410> using<00:04:06.650> shape<00:04:07.130> you<00:04:07.730> start<00:04:08.030> to

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:08.150 
find that by using shape you start to

find that by using shape you start to

actually think differently you see
differently<00:04:10.610> because<00:04:10.840> shape<00:04:11.840> is<00:04:12.110> really<00:04:12.830> a

differently because shape is really a
