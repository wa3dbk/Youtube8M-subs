and then but the problem is it's okay to
turn<00:00:45.989> right<00:00:48.500> okay<00:00:49.500> but<00:00:49.559> now<00:00:49.860> the<00:00:50.579> white<00:00:50.879> part

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
turn right okay but now the white part

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.639 
turn right okay but now the white part
is<00:00:51.590> is<00:00:52.590> not<00:00:52.949> in<00:00:53.309> facing<00:00:54.030> the<00:00:54.059> front<00:00:54.390> so<00:00:55.079> it

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
is is not in facing the front so it

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:02.569 
is is not in facing the front so it
cannot<00:00:56.039> backwards<00:01:00.620> so<00:01:01.620> the<00:01:01.800> wheel<00:01:01.980> in<00:01:02.340> the

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
cannot backwards so the wheel in the

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.329 
cannot backwards so the wheel in the
front<00:01:02.820> doesn't<00:01:03.239> move<00:01:03.539> at<00:01:03.750> all<00:01:03.949> which<00:01:04.949> is<00:01:04.979> very

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
front doesn't move at all which is very

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.570 
front doesn't move at all which is very
dangerous<00:01:05.640> okay<00:01:06.240> so<00:01:07.010> we're<00:01:08.010> now<00:01:08.250> going<00:01:08.490> to

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
dangerous okay so we're now going to

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.000 
dangerous okay so we're now going to
move<00:01:08.970> this<00:01:09.270> back<00:01:09.570> to<00:01:09.869> the<00:01:10.080> normal<00:01:10.740> state

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
move this back to the normal state

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:16.789 
move this back to the normal state
situation<00:01:12.500> so<00:01:13.500> we<00:01:13.799> have<00:01:14.010> to<00:01:14.810> manually<00:01:15.810> move

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
situation so we have to manually move

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:22.820 
situation so we have to manually move
the<00:01:16.860> wheel<00:01:17.820> like<00:01:18.060> this<00:01:18.090> and<00:01:19.009> then

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.280
