00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.300
 from 

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:10.799
 I want to cook a linguine pasta dish with red pesto 

00:00:10.799 --> 00:00:14.209
 and let's see the ingredients together for 2 people 

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:18.140
 let's start by listing the ingredients you need to prepare the 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.800
 text 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:21.109
 we need ricotta 

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:22.409
 20 grams 

00:00:22.409 --> 00:00:24.829
 About 20 grams of pecorino 

00:00:24.829 --> 00:00:26.730
 20 grams of capers 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.769
 20 grams of almonds and I have already soaked in hot water 

00:00:31.419 --> 00:00:32.940
 a pinch of salt 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.980
 extra virgin olive oil 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.010
 the red pretext we will use double tomato paste 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:41.840
 thanks to its density it will give me body 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:44.120
 with pesto 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:47.440
 naturally pasta and pasta I have already meanwhile 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:48.500
 bersani 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:50.660
 to cook salt water 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:52.040
 plentiful 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:55.810
 the linguine are these linguini made from durum wheat semolina 

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:56.910
 then 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.650
 we have everything we need we start preparing the ingredients 

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:02.380
 first of all 

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:04.489
 I prepare the pecorino 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:07.800
 I should put bits of it in me help with 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:14.340
 a grater for kids live holes so I do it first as I add 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.600
 the ingredients the capers 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:19.600
 pecorino cheese 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:23.560
 ricotta 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:27.210
 and then we send the almonds because they put them in a bath 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.500
 bath because almonds are hard crunchy with hot water yes 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:31.460
 soften 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:32.299
 then 

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:34.620
 when I have to mix 

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:38.350
 the compound because it will be quite thick 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:41.830
 I will have a softer almond than the almond water itself 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:42.910
 all right 

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:46.820
 so I don't even lose taste, let's say it's a bit of almond milk 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.790
 let's see if I will need it again 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:51.880
 add liquidity 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:53.760
 salt important 

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:56.760
 it is a text of and therefore seasoning 

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:58.030
 we add 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:01.800
 if anything, badly, a sassari was conceived after leaving 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:05.010
 tasty 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:06.120
 concentrated 

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:08.449
 double the tomato paste well 

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:11.449
 memento half pipe 

00:02:12.149 --> 00:02:16.139
 I squeeze it directly into the carafe where then with the immersion mixer 

00:02:16.719 --> 00:02:19.719
 on the rho all the ingredients 

00:02:20.619 --> 00:02:22.439
 poly astra virgin olive oil 

00:02:22.439 --> 00:02:25.899
 so I still miss a liquid part for 

00:02:25.899 --> 00:02:29.969
 blend anyway a compact creaminess let's see if I need it 

00:02:29.969 --> 00:02:32.969
 liquid care probable thing 

00:02:33.789 --> 00:02:34.839
 add 

00:02:34.839 --> 00:02:39.419
 if anything, or of the cooking water uk of the vegetable broth or simply 

00:02:39.419 --> 00:02:42.419
 water like that of the tides 

00:02:44.639 --> 00:02:47.639
 it's a red pesto 

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:51.599
 I add another drop of almond water 

00:02:59.299 --> 00:03:01.509
 I have to keep a cream 

00:03:01.509 --> 00:03:04.509
 Venissa 

00:03:07.869 --> 00:03:10.889
 I refer to the density of classic basil pesto 

00:03:18.869 --> 00:03:20.200
 now let's see if 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:23.200
 the pasta is ready 

00:03:27.649 --> 00:03:29.799
 heatran a little piece I look yes 

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:33.329
 we have a slight lighter soul in the white interior 

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:34.659
 so it means that the pasta 

00:03:34.659 --> 00:03:37.199
 and al dente a bowl directly 

00:03:37.199 --> 00:03:41.789
 as all text does not need to be heated we have a lot of pasta 

00:03:41.789 --> 00:03:42.559
 hot 

00:03:42.559 --> 00:03:45.469
 so I don't even go to armed school 

00:03:45.469 --> 00:03:47.089
 in the colander 

00:03:47.089 --> 00:03:49.000
 but I take it directly 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.559
 if it will also be a little unity 

00:03:51.559 --> 00:03:52.839
 no problem 

00:03:52.839 --> 00:03:55.839
 we used double tomato paste 

00:03:57.439 --> 00:03:58.909
 perfect 

00:03:58.909 --> 00:04:01.919
 we put ourselves here comfortably 

00:04:01.919 --> 00:04:04.759
 maybe use 

00:04:04.759 --> 00:04:07.759
 a pallet like this 

00:04:09.899 --> 00:04:12.899
 the red text 

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:19.620
 we receive 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:23.750
 and the pasta is practically ready therefore an extremely fast dish 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:27.639
 we are ready to implant 

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:31.610
 red pesto linguine we are ready to serve beautiful color 

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:35.490
 scent fantastic sin you can't hear it 

00:04:37.189 --> 00:04:41.949
 we prepare a portion for help with a former color as one has a fork 

00:04:42.659 --> 00:04:46.279
 I create a portion of the control already well so as not to soil 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:51.599
 support 

00:04:51.599 --> 00:04:53.520
 with the order 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:54.590
 net 

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:57.689
 just a little leaf 

00:04:57.689 --> 00:05:01.599
 to raise the pot even higher. it is a very simple dish very much 

00:05:01.599 --> 00:05:05.770
 fast the text you find it ready in the refrigerator arrived at home put 

00:05:05.769 --> 00:05:06.940
 on things that maybe 

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:09.050
 arrived late from work well 

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:11.499
 this is the dish that is right for you
