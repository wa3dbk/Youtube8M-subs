00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.170
 steady in our mind 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:05.940
 stereotype that is actually floating 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.130
 means available only to very rich 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:10.889
 people but the exhibition held in Atlanta 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.900
 debunked this myth even the organizers 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:15.389
 the exhibitions were at a loss to tell us the exact 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.850
 number of yacht and jet ski boats 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:20.910
 presented at the exhibition alone 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:23.369
 called hundreds of other 1000 exhibits but 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.410
 all agreed on the fact that now 41 years 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:29.130
 from lansky sh u holds palm 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:31.080
 in the united states the boats are certainly not 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.540
 car and without them you can do 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.489
 but they are quite popular in the country it 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.100
 at the same time sport and rest 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:40.140
 and for some, a lifestyle 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.690
 really market take care of people 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.370
 the most diverse incomes the cost of the lot 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.219
 ranges from a few thousand to 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:49.230
 several hundred thousand dollars there 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:50.670
 probably more expensive but they are all over 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.920
 appearances are exposed in any 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.739
 other places since wide 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.570
 consumer not calculated buying 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.699
 big ship need to think not only about 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.190
 his own price but also about what 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:04.199
 its content will cost in particular 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.830
 water parking sometimes reaching 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:09.780
 tens of thousands of dollars a year 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:11.909
 Here such boats can be kept in your 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.840
 you canâ€™t say anything about the garage 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.880
 floating palace 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.770
 I wonder what driving even such 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.470
 hulk does not require special 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:22.530
 licensed or lengthy workouts got up 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:24.900
 at the helm and sailed this ship 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.820
 designed for rivers and lakes in the open 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.770
 the sea won't come out on it so you don't 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:32.670
 need special knowledge of navigation 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:35.130
 or the art of the pilot is this ship 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:37.950
 about half a million four bedrooms in it 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:40.470
 shower kitchen-living room some family 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:43.680
 buys such vessels instead of houses combining 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:46.890
 simultaneously all pleasures age 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:49.530
 Our buyers range from 35 to 65 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:52.020
 years their family income is from 100 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.490
 thousand dollars code and higher usually 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.240
 they are either highly paid 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.710
 the professionals 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:59.299
 either their business owners 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:01.430
 those who do not belong to the first not 

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:03.409
 to the second but passionately reaching for big 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:05.990
 water you can try your hand at 

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:08.630
 sailing on such a single 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:11.780
 boats know people say that here 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:13.910
 also there is nothing complicated our main 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:16.670
 buyers are parents attach children 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:20.060
