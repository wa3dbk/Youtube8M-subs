right here I'm finding the third part so

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:27.920 
right here I'm finding the third part so
really<00:00:26.820> the<00:00:26.939> the<00:00:27.180> trickiest<00:00:27.449> part<00:00:27.689> is<00:00:27.750> just

really the the trickiest part is just

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.310 
really the the trickiest part is just
finding<00:00:28.320> the<00:00:28.710> locations<00:00:29.460> now<00:00:29.880> some<00:00:30.119> of<00:00:30.150> the

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:30.320 
finding the locations now some of the

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:33.020 
finding the locations now some of the
locations<00:00:31.320> do<00:00:31.529> vary<00:00:31.830> so<00:00:32.550> you<00:00:32.640> just<00:00:32.790> have<00:00:32.910> to

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
locations do vary so you just have to

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:34.580 
locations do vary so you just have to
keep<00:00:33.180> looking<00:00:33.540> around<00:00:33.660> and<00:00:34.110> finding<00:00:34.500> them

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
the unlock hit farm but ideally would do

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:44.840 
the unlock hit farm but ideally would do
the<00:01:43.470> one<00:01:43.590> at<00:01:43.680> farm<00:01:43.920> first<00:01:44.189> and<00:01:44.369> then<00:01:44.670> you<00:01:44.729> would

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
the one at farm first and then you would

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.160 
the one at farm first and then you would
do<00:01:44.909> this<00:01:45.000> one<00:01:45.119> but<00:01:45.270> you<00:01:45.659> can<00:01:45.780> see<00:01:45.899> there<00:01:46.020> was<00:01:46.140> a

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
do this one but you can see there was a

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.560 
do this one but you can see there was a
part<00:01:46.380> down<00:01:46.470> here<00:01:46.770> as<00:01:47.399> I<00:01:47.520> fell<00:01:47.700> down<00:01:47.850> and<00:01:48.090> you

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
part down here as I fell down and you

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.090 
part down here as I fell down and you
just<00:01:48.720> have<00:01:48.869> to<00:01:48.960> look<00:01:49.079> around<00:01:49.350> this<00:01:49.470> area<00:01:49.710> in

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
just have to look around this area in

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.580 
just have to look around this area in
this<00:01:50.610> room<00:01:50.970> for<00:01:51.299> three<00:01:51.509> different<00:01:51.600> parts<00:01:52.020> you

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
this room for three different parts you

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.440 
this room for three different parts you
might<00:01:52.979> find<00:01:53.189> a<00:01:53.310> fourth<00:01:53.549> part<00:01:53.790> the<00:01:53.939> fourth<00:01:54.180> part

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
might find a fourth part the fourth part

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.630 
might find a fourth part the fourth part
might<00:01:54.689> not<00:01:54.840> be<00:01:55.110> built<00:01:55.380> on<00:01:55.619> this<00:01:55.829> location

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
might not be built on this location

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.459 
might not be built on this location
because<00:01:56.790> it<00:01:57.149> is<00:01:57.270> actually<00:01:57.540> used<00:01:57.960> for<00:01:58.229> the

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
because it is actually used for the

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:00.319 
because it is actually used for the
Wonder<00:01:58.680> weapon<00:01:58.770> so<00:01:59.159> if<00:01:59.759> you<00:01:59.850> guys<00:01:59.969> find<00:02:00.240> a

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
Wonder weapon so if you guys find a

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:01.819 
Wonder weapon so if you guys find a
little<00:02:00.509> coil<00:02:00.719> thing<00:02:00.990> it's<00:02:01.200> not<00:02:01.320> for<00:02:01.680> the

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
little coil thing it's not for the

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:04.700 
little coil thing it's not for the
buildable<00:02:02.100> of<00:02:02.369> the<00:02:02.460> electric<00:02:02.850> parts<00:02:03.780> so<00:02:04.530> don't

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
buildable of the electric parts so don't

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.980 
buildable of the electric parts so don't
freak<00:02:04.950> out<00:02:05.130> when<00:02:05.310> you<00:02:05.340> see<00:02:05.610> an<00:02:06.000> extra<00:02:06.299> part<00:02:06.509> but

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
freak out when you see an extra part but

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.080 
freak out when you see an extra part but
uh<00:02:07.049> but<00:02:07.619> I<00:02:07.770> think<00:02:07.829> they're<00:02:08.310> right<00:02:08.640> here<00:02:08.819> and

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090

uh but I think they're right here and
that's<00:02:09.270> this<00:02:09.450> is<00:02:09.599> a<00:02:09.629> kind<00:02:09.869> of<00:02:09.899> a<00:02:09.989> difficult<00:02:10.739> one

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
that's this is a kind of a difficult one

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.500 
that's this is a kind of a difficult one
to<00:02:10.890> find<00:02:11.160> as<00:02:11.250> well<00:02:11.400> sometimes<00:02:11.970> it's<00:02:12.120> on<00:02:12.209> window

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
to find as well sometimes it's on window

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:13.820 
to find as well sometimes it's on window
seals<00:02:12.750> if<00:02:12.930> you<00:02:13.020> can't<00:02:13.200> find<00:02:13.349> them

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
seals if you can't find them

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.740 
seals if you can't find them

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
and then I'm gonna drop down here I'm

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:16.880 
and then I'm gonna drop down here I'm
gonna<00:02:15.870> go<00:02:15.990> ahead<00:02:16.050> and<00:02:16.230> grab<00:02:16.380> this<00:02:16.560> and<00:02:16.800> then

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
gonna go ahead and grab this and then

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:18.590 
gonna go ahead and grab this and then
I'm<00:02:16.950> gonna<00:02:17.040> look<00:02:17.190> over<00:02:17.520> and<00:02:17.700> find<00:02:18.240> the<00:02:18.420> last

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:18.600 
I'm gonna look over and find the last

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.300 
I'm gonna look over and find the last
piece<00:02:18.720> right<00:02:19.140> here<00:02:19.200> I<00:02:19.620> mean<00:02:19.890> a<00:02:19.950> lot<00:02:20.070> of<00:02:20.160> times

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
piece right here I mean a lot of times

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:22.070 
piece right here I mean a lot of times
things<00:02:20.850> are<00:02:21.000> just<00:02:21.120> kind<00:02:21.270> of<00:02:21.390> blending<00:02:21.810> into

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
things are just kind of blending into

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.080 
things are just kind of blending into
the<00:02:22.590> environment<00:02:23.490> so<00:02:23.610> it<00:02:23.700> makes<00:02:23.850> it<00:02:23.970> difficult

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
the environment so it makes it difficult

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:26.300 
the environment so it makes it difficult
but<00:02:24.450> hopefully<00:02:25.140> this<00:02:25.410> video<00:02:25.650> will<00:02:25.890> be<00:02:26.010> helpful

this<00:02:43.380> lawnmower<00:02:43.590> in<00:02:43.920> the<00:02:44.040> barn<00:02:44.250> I<00:02:44.460> found<00:02:45.180> it

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:45.270 
this lawnmower in the barn I found it

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:46.520 
this lawnmower in the barn I found it
out<00:02:45.390> here<00:02:45.600> you<00:02:45.690> can<00:02:45.810> also<00:02:45.930> find<00:02:46.110> it<00:02:46.260> right<00:02:46.350> here

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
out here you can also find it right here

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:47.870 
out here you can also find it right here
on<00:02:46.560> the<00:02:46.740> right<00:02:46.920> hand<00:02:46.950> side<00:02:47.280> where<00:02:47.580> I<00:02:47.640> knifed

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:47.880 
on the right hand side where I knifed

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:50.420 
on the right hand side where I knifed
and<00:02:48.180> then<00:02:48.870> you<00:02:48.990> go<00:02:49.140> inside<00:02:49.500> and<00:02:49.830> the<00:02:49.920> bench<00:02:50.100> is

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
and then you go inside and the bench is

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:52.310 
and then you go inside and the bench is
right<00:02:50.640> here<00:02:50.820> you<00:02:51.210> can<00:02:51.330> only<00:02:51.540> build<00:02:51.840> the<00:02:51.990> parts

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:52.320 
right here you can only build the parts

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:54.920 
right here you can only build the parts
on<00:02:52.500> the<00:02:52.700> respective<00:02:53.700> areas<00:02:54.120> so<00:02:54.300> I<00:02:54.510> can<00:02:54.750> only

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
on the respective areas so I can only

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:57.920 
on the respective areas so I can only
build<00:02:55.230> the<00:02:55.410> turret<00:02:55.560> parts<00:02:55.860> on<00:02:56.240> this<00:02:57.240> area<00:02:57.720> so

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
build the turret parts on this area so

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:59.480 
build the turret parts on this area so
if<00:02:58.020> you<00:02:58.080> bring<00:02:58.260> it<00:02:58.410> up<00:02:58.560> some<00:02:59.040> parts<00:02:59.280> from<00:02:59.400> a

00:02:59.480 --> 00:02:59.490 
if you bring it up some parts from a

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:01.580 
if you bring it up some parts from a
different<00:02:59.640> location<00:03:00.240> you<00:03:01.050> can't<00:03:01.290> build<00:03:01.470> a

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
different location you can't build a

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:02.990 
different location you can't build a
mill<00:03:01.709> say<00:03:01.920> you<00:03:01.980> can't<00:03:02.220> build<00:03:02.370> this<00:03:02.550> part<00:03:02.820> here

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
mill say you can't build this part here

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.870 
mill say you can't build this part here
so<00:03:03.030> just<00:03:03.660> a<00:03:03.750> heads<00:03:03.930> up<00:03:04.020> on<00:03:04.170> that<00:03:04.380> as<00:03:05.130> well<00:03:05.340> but

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:05.880 
so just a heads up on that as well but

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:07.010 
so just a heads up on that as well but
uh<00:03:05.910> but<00:03:06.240> hopefully<00:03:06.450> guys<00:03:06.570> are<00:03:06.720> gonna<00:03:06.810> find

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:07.020 
uh but hopefully guys are gonna find

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
locations to show you guys the last part

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:15.760 
locations to show you guys the last part
was<00:03:12.990> usually<00:03:13.530> up<00:03:13.709> in<00:03:13.890> the<00:03:13.980> other<00:03:14.400> location

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:15.770 
was usually up in the other location

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:18.259 
was usually up in the other location
upstairs<00:03:16.770> but<00:03:17.130> actually<00:03:17.670> I<00:03:17.730> found<00:03:18.060> a<00:03:18.150> little

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720 
in the the machine and go ahead and show

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:26.780 
in the the machine and go ahead and show
you<00:03:24.780> guys<00:03:24.840> the<00:03:25.230> achievements<00:03:26.070> being<00:03:26.489> unlocked

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790 
you guys the achievements being unlocked

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:29.479 
you guys the achievements being unlocked
but<00:03:26.970> yeah<00:03:27.930> pretty<00:03:28.230> pretty<00:03:28.620> easy<00:03:29.100> to<00:03:29.340> do<00:03:29.459> you

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:29.489 
but yeah pretty pretty easy to do you

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:31.220 
but yeah pretty pretty easy to do you
can<00:03:29.850> do<00:03:29.940> this<00:03:30.090> probably<00:03:30.420> a<00:03:30.450> lot<00:03:30.660> easier<00:03:31.019> if<00:03:31.080> you

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.230 
can do this probably a lot easier if you

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:31.940 
can do this probably a lot easier if you
had<00:03:31.380> four<00:03:31.590> players

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:31.950 
had four players

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:33.920 
had four players
anyways<00:03:32.790> that's<00:03:33.000> pretty<00:03:33.209> much<00:03:33.330> it<00:03:33.480> also<00:03:33.720> if

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:33.930 
anyways that's pretty much it also if

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:35.509 
anyways that's pretty much it also if
you<00:03:34.019> guys<00:03:34.110> were<00:03:34.290> curious<00:03:34.590> about<00:03:34.680> turning<00:03:35.430> the

00:03:35.509 --> 00:03:35.519 
you guys were curious about turning the

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:36.920 
you guys were curious about turning the
power<00:03:35.640> on<00:03:35.790> to<00:03:36.060> this<00:03:36.180> turret<00:03:36.570> right<00:03:36.660> here<00:03:36.840> you

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
power on to this turret right here you

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:38.570 
power on to this turret right here you
actually<00:03:37.050> get<00:03:37.320> you<00:03:37.620> need<00:03:37.830> to<00:03:37.920> use<00:03:38.040> the<00:03:38.190> turbine

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:38.580 
actually get you need to use the turbine

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:40.430 
actually get you need to use the turbine
when<00:03:39.120> it<00:03:39.239> says<00:03:39.420> uses<00:03:39.810> the<00:03:39.900> power<00:03:40.050> because<00:03:40.410> you

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:40.440 
when it says uses the power because you

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:42.020 
when it says uses the power because you
can't<00:03:40.769> actually<00:03:41.070> power<00:03:41.459> this<00:03:41.640> or<00:03:41.880> the

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.030 
can't actually power this or the

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:43.850 
can't actually power this or the
electric<00:03:42.360> thing<00:03:42.510> without<00:03:42.630> the<00:03:42.840> turbine<00:03:43.110> have

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:43.860 
electric thing without the turbine have

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:45.050 
electric thing without the turbine have
a<00:03:43.890> good<00:03:44.040> one<00:03:44.160> and<00:03:44.370> we'll<00:03:44.670> catch<00:03:44.940> you<00:03:45.000> guys

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:45.060
