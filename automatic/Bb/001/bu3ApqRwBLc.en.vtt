00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:50.159

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:52.530
 I read every town marbles but to me 

00:00:50.159 --> 00:00:54.070
 liked how it looks like this only what is 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:57.840

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:57.840

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:03.710
 after this I will put the acrylic 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:03.710

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:08.610
 I'm going to accommodate it in the other anchor 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.640
 tension 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:14.570
 and I'm going to give some more girls with the same 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.570
 golden acrylic 

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:19.470
 and I'm going to put the same pink acrylic 

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:25.190
 and now I'm going to put a new mosque 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:28.280
 which is called ferry 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:30.020
 I'm going to put half of the water that 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:32.650
 is at the tip I'm going to put other 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:32.650
 acrylics 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:40.390
 my store is going to open this week 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:42.460
 I will be warning you if you want 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:46.060
 acquire the product Gordonian since 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:49.740
 I always receive questions about them 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:51.530
 they have no connection 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.400
 almond acrylics 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:56.230
 resin and much more 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:58.650
 now the same as it says at the beginning and 

00:01:56.230 --> 00:02:00.970
 I'll do it at the tip but with 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:04.500
 taking smaller parts because 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:06.680
 only space 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.990
 and put it 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:12.250
 now I'm going to put with crystal acrylic 

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:12.250
 I'm going to stick some flowers 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:17.630
 the reason why I do this design so 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:20.180
 long I will explain 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:23.780
 it's because I wanted to do with all 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:28.040
 these colors but I did not have the time 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:30.620
 so I wanted to be in this one like this but 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:33.150
 I'm going to tell you, for example, 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:35.939
 can put on the middle finger worth 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:38.240
 the manual given that I am principle can 

00:02:35.939 --> 00:02:42.220
 impose that marbling 

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:42.220
 in the dow of the ring they can put 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:46.920
 the appointment with which he had 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:49.950
 and 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:52.500
 in the little finger can put the stack and 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:55.160
 perhaps 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:57.520
 in 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:03:01.450
 finger 

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:02.950
 and you can put the flowers this is 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:05.960
 so you can see how they can 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:08.160
 combine colors is fine then 

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:10.950
 only people who like them 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:13.520
 the long nails can be encouraged 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:15.080
 put it on you can leave it like that 

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:17.960
 but I want you to see the 

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:20.540
 concept of the nail and so you can 

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:23.330
 alternate the colors in an entire being and what 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:25.630
 You can cut this little flower 

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:29.420
 leaving is five petals is very basic 

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:32.450
 the company with some perlite to next 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:34.760
 I also put it another way in the 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:37.850
 tip like a woman with three petals 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:40.760
 pebbles and that's how it is and I put the 

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:42.170
 club I hope you liked and whoever 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:45.700
 the end but to see the cattle of the 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:45.700
 decoration see you soon
