Hello everyone, my name is Nilsor and welcome to The Dragon Cook Tavern

00:00:04.873 --> 00:00:07.077
In this show I’m going to propose to you recipes

00:00:07.077 --> 00:00:10.295
to bring food and beverages from video games into real life

00:00:11.364 --> 00:00:14.403
Today we are going to make to make some Soykaf from Shadowrun

00:00:14.772 --> 00:00:17.744
In the game we know that it is made of Soy beans

00:00:18.592 --> 00:00:20.670
The things we will need are going to simply be

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:23.868
1 pound or 500 grams of Yellow Soy Beans

00:00:23.868 --> 00:00:26.948
which you can find in any Organic Food Shop

00:00:26.948 --> 00:00:28.542
Now let’s do it

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:30.942
Spread your soy beans on a baking sheet

00:00:30.942 --> 00:00:37.352
then put it in the oven at 140°C or 280°F for 1 hour

00:00:37.352 --> 00:00:40.056
Shuffle the beans a bit during that time

00:00:40.056 --> 00:00:46.228
Then up the heat at 160°C or 320°F for another hour

00:00:46.429 --> 00:00:51.645
Then 10 minutes at 180°C or 350°F

00:00:52.036 --> 00:00:56.546
10 minutes at 200°C or 390°F

00:00:56.719 --> 00:01:02.028
8 minutes at 220°C or 430°F

00:01:02.242 --> 00:01:08.140
And finally 5 minutes at 240°C or 460°F

00:01:08.497 --> 00:01:11.504
Your beans should have taken a nice brown color

00:01:11.692 --> 00:01:14.840
Put them in the fridge for at least 30 minutes to cool

00:01:15.063 --> 00:01:18.174
And now it’s time to grind the beans into powder

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:47.748
Then prepare your drink like you do a usual coffee according to your own preference

00:01:48.833 --> 00:01:50.115
And voilà!

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:01.500
