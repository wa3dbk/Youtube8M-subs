00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:13.679
 BMW 5 Series got the long-awaited 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.540
 restyled cars changed outwardly from but 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:18.529
 major transformations occurred inside 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.529
 in electronics 

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:25.170
 Although it is necessary to start all the same design fluent 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.000
 a look noticing only the new optics and to 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:30.300
 this we will come back but real 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.369
 change much more generous hand 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.380
 designers machine has received more than a dozen 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.030
 transformation in appearance I'm big 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:39.470
 some of them will be noticeable just 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:41.360
 previous owner of the whole machine 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:42.770
 of really useful improved 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:47.720
 aerodynamics and extra 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:50.300
 noise isolation many item update 5 

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:53.030
 batman series went with already appeared 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:56.690
 e class on it again and a6 and this 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:59.090
 cars equipped in general a little bit 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:03.020
 better than the five that exists on 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:04.760
 market for several years therefore a large 

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:06.920
 part of the changes touched it all 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:08.900
 possible options and electronic assistants 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:11.300
 which managed to seriously advance with 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:12.619
 the release of the 5th series although the Germans themselves 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:14.510
 call the car not only more 

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:16.160
 comfortable but also more sporting 

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:17.960
 last moment we could well 

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:20.930
 feel on the driveway without 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:21.710
 asphalt where shaking is necessary to five significantly 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:24.500
 such a way 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:27.910
 it is felt that the suspension can still be 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:30.170
 to work there is something that tends to 

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:32.060
 on bad roads was supposed to help 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:33.890
 adaptive suspension system instant 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:35.780
 dumpier control which is just in mode 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:37.729
 real time adjusts stiffness 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:39.470
 shock absorber but first stand all 

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:41.840
 equal to hydraulic and second 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:44.590
 Changes occur already upon departure 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:44.590
 on a bad road 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.329
 already known change modes 

00:01:46.469 --> 00:01:51.780
 mechatronic chassis changes not only 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:54.329
 habits tuning the car but changes 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.979
 the complete instrument panel which is now 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:59.369
 looks like one big 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:01.740
 cheese display in sport mode is huge 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:04.229
 tachometer digital speedometer as per color 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:06.179
 once in the usual traditional appliances with 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:08.519
 lightly zooming current speed 

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:09.959
 in gopro almost space console 

00:02:08.519 --> 00:02:11.400
 apparatus speedometer 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:13.769
 lined to one hundred and twenty kilometers 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:16.440
 per hour methods about the metro maximum 

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:18.480
 information about fuel economy usual 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:21.209
 opponent of such a plan of decisions because 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:23.370
 what to catch appliances does not look 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:26.250
 present all these drawn arrows 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:29.430
 it does not allow to feel the car 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:34.110
 car and but specific BMW 5 series 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:35.819
 everything is done just fine but 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:38.459
 most other electronic buns 

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:39.660
 its for the Russians while the machine is not available 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:41.700
 still ca n't read and 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:43.470
 recognize the Russian language is not able to 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:44.940
 cannot work as a personal concierge 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:46.980
 move independently in the fatherland 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:48.690
 traffic jams and the saddest cannot 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:51.090
 call an ambulance emergency case 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:52.739
 really fix it all soon but 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:54.959
 full round view system 

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:56.910
 automatic parking or night 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:57.700
 third generation vision is not easy 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:00.879
 available 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:02.470
 also work well for example if 

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:04.900
 get too close to the car 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:06.099
 ahead of the car says that too 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:08.080
 slightly increase and machine tools 

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:10.450
 it used to happen as it were 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:12.940
 optionally now this happens with 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:14.920
 parking lot automatically monitors 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:15.310
 so as you drive what happens on 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:21.069
 the road 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:23.530
 then do the whole gamut of engines too 

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:25.510
 passed guilty and similar or slightly larger 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:27.549
 power consumption fuel consumption 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:28.810
 succeeded once again no again not 

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:32.290
 last due 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:33.849
 eco pro system itself is here second 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:36.370
 generations like this tested by us 

00:03:33.849 --> 00:03:38.049
 recently fours or x5 working together 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:39.670
 with navigation and she prepares in advance 

00:03:38.049 --> 00:03:41.769
 car coming road sections 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:44.079
 the selection may include a motion mode 

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:46.989
 the order is breaking the motor link with 

00:03:44.079 --> 00:03:49.990
 wheels and even despite the green 

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:53.200
 technology dynamics of the five impressive 

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:56.470
 in our case it's 535 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:57.910
 with a 3-liter turbo engine disappears 306 

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:00.270
 horsepower and accelerates your 

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:02.620
 wrist cog great result 

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:04.630
 Plus if you add all -wheel drive 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:06.670
 the machine will get even faster by one or 

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:08.160
 will bring though inside it is almost not 

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:10.420
 felt 

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:12.370
 The interesting point is that 

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:13.000
 modern cars have become so 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:15.310
 quiet 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.739
 that the sound from the engine does not flow into the cabin 

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:19.239
 and when a person presses sport mode 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:20.860
 duel basically clicks on the gas he 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:23.139
 wants to hear how the car accelerates 

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:25.180
 hello engine 

00:04:23.139 --> 00:04:27.189
 so the five is equipped with the so -called 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:28.840
 sim pause device artificially 

00:04:27.189 --> 00:04:31.689
 transmitting the sound of the engine to the salon through 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:33.999
 regular system speakers 

00:04:31.689 --> 00:04:37.179
 and the driver hears the car accelerate 

00:04:33.999 --> 00:04:38.950
 does it with such good manly 

00:04:37.179 --> 00:04:41.520
 by sound 

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:41.520
 opaque 

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:46.800
 and when you donâ€™t have heard enough 

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:48.600
 switch mode and car settings 

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:50.790
 in comfort and silence 

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:54.500
 although there is one little merry with them 

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:57.240
 story before the first it appeared on bmw 

00:04:54.500 --> 00:05:00.420
 engineers suggested making three options 

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:04.140
 car settings is sport normal 

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:06.660
 and eco pro would seem quite logical and 

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:08.970
 name for settings car up to 

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:11.520
 then marketers thought and decided not to 

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:13.050
 we are talking about the IMF can not be 

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:15.870
 normal what's the norm 

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:21.000
 so redesigned frampton comfortable 

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:23.280
 to normal saloon change modest 

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.050
 the top five was a line of luxury design 

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:28.430
 or modern and almost all new items 

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:30.300
 match just this event a 

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:32.580
 I'm playing next generation 

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:34.500
 as an option got a touch washer 

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:38.430
 therefore already told in detail on 

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:39.930
 test 3 series jid still changed here 

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:41.580
 Cup holders and also appeared 

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:44.270
 chrome border around the display 

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:46.440
 But about this as you and not conveniently recall 

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:49.830
 plus new options added here 

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:52.140
 finishing further leather BMW cars was 

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:53.180
 very tough but it seems like she doesn't 

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:55.800
 hard and went 

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:58.740
 now when skin war has appeared 

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:59.660
 on the wheel ah jeep grand cherokee honda 

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:04.260
 civic 

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:06.210
 opi courses in went young consumers 

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:07.530
 also on the fives now available 

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:09.810
 full led headlights 

00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:11.580
 and this is not just an LED 

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:13.890
 adaptive LEDs that can 

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:16.830
 change beam adapts to the road 

00:06:13.890 --> 00:06:19.880
 and for example, even when meeting cars 

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:22.340
 light up the shoulder 

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:23.990
 also built into the front optics 

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:25.430
 special sections highlighting 

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:28.750
 possible obstacles in the dark 

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:31.100
 whether pedestrians are not an animal worker 

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:34.160
 Tarmo countries earn a little softer 

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:35.510
 than I expected imprint imposes 

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:39.520
 adopted on the leg 

00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:39.520
 where did you come back tonight 

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:47.710
 target audience of five businessman 

00:06:45.699 --> 00:06:48.340
 managers department heads and 

00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:50.949
 che non 

00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:52.930
 mostly men from 45 years old though 

00:06:50.949 --> 00:06:55.150
 beautiful eyes behind the wheel can sit down and 

00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:57.129
 women, we felt Moscow will fall 

00:06:55.150 --> 00:06:57.550
 first year of ownership of the updated BMW 5 

00:06:57.129 --> 00:07:00.009
 series 

00:06:57.550 --> 00:07:02.439
 its what get those mandatory expenses 

00:07:00.009 --> 00:07:03.909
 Casco and MTPL policy transport tax 

00:07:02.439 --> 00:07:05.620
 and maintenance 

00:07:03.909 --> 00:07:07.539
 we have developed a loss of car value for 

00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:10.930
 year and fuel consumption for this before and 

00:07:07.539 --> 00:07:13.000
 Moreover 930 5600 13 rubles 

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:15.789
 so one kilometer of the way is 

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:17.800
 37 rubles and 42 cafes which means that 

00:07:15.789 --> 00:07:19.810
 a trip to work will cost the owner 

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:23.909
 nine hundred thirty six rubles per pair 

00:07:19.810 --> 00:07:23.909
 days you can save for a decent tie
