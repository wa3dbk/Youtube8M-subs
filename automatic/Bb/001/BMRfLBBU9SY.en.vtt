choose to take your Phantom out to the
to<00:00:48.850> the<00:00:48.940> waters<00:00:49.329> and<00:00:49.600> it's<00:00:50.500> something<00:00:50.860> I<00:00:50.980> would

00:00:51.029 --> 00:00:51.039 
to the waters and it's something I would

00:00:51.039 --> 00:00:53.279 
to the waters and it's something I would
strongly<00:00:51.550> suggest<00:00:51.940> if<00:00:52.359> you<00:00:52.480> do<00:00:52.690> decide<00:00:52.899> to<00:00:53.050> do

something<00:00:53.620> like<00:00:53.710> that<00:00:53.770> number<00:00:54.129> one<00:00:54.370> expect<00:00:54.730> to

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:54.850 
something like that number one expect to

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:57.479 
something like that number one expect to
lose<00:00:55.030> it<00:00:55.270> because<00:00:55.690> water<00:00:56.289> you<00:00:57.100> guys<00:00:57.250> in<00:00:57.399> the

00:00:57.479 --> 00:00:57.489 
lose it because water you guys in the

00:00:57.489 --> 00:00:58.860 
lose it because water you guys in the
water<00:00:57.640> is<00:00:57.789> probably<00:00:58.030> gone<00:00:58.210> forever

00:00:58.860 --> 00:00:58.870 
water is probably gone forever

then you've got the ground sensors a

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:55.169 
then you've got the ground sensors a
downward<00:01:52.759> facing<00:01:52.939> camera<00:01:53.659> on<00:01:53.929> the<00:01:54.649> phantom<00:01:54.979> 3

to have a bunch of just staring at the

to have a bunch of just staring at the
front<00:03:00.069> of<00:03:00.130> the<00:03:00.220> boat<00:03:00.400> but<00:03:01.180> one<00:03:01.360> thing<00:03:01.510> you'll

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:01.660 
front of the boat but one thing you'll

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:03.809

notice<00:03:01.959> when<00:03:02.140> you<00:03:02.170> when<00:03:02.500> I<00:03:02.530> when<00:03:03.069> I<00:03:03.100> landed<00:03:03.580> I

00:03:03.809 --> 00:03:03.819 
notice when you when I when I landed I

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:05.910 
notice when you when I when I landed I
shifted<00:03:04.780> the<00:03:04.840> left<00:03:05.140> stick<00:03:05.380> all<00:03:05.530> the<00:03:05.650> way<00:03:05.680> down

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:05.920 
shifted the left stick all the way down

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:08.160 
shifted the left stick all the way down
I<00:03:05.950> did<00:03:06.190> not<00:03:06.310> do<00:03:06.489> both<00:03:06.730> sticks<00:03:07.060> like<00:03:07.959> I<00:03:08.110> normally

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:08.170 
I did not do both sticks like I normally

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:11.610 
I did not do both sticks like I normally
do<00:03:08.680> when<00:03:09.330> when<00:03:10.330> I<00:03:10.360> when<00:03:11.050> I<00:03:11.110> turn<00:03:11.350> off<00:03:11.470> the

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:11.620 
do when when I when I turn off the

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:12.900 
do when when I when I turn off the
engines<00:03:11.950> and<00:03:12.100> the<00:03:12.160> reason<00:03:12.400> I<00:03:12.459> did<00:03:12.640> that<00:03:12.790> you

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:12.910 
engines and the reason I did that you

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:16.890 
engines and the reason I did that you
saw<00:03:13.120> how<00:03:13.330> it<00:03:13.510> landed<00:03:13.989> and<00:03:14.230> it<00:03:14.860> kept<00:03:15.130> very<00:03:15.900> it

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:16.900 
saw how it landed and it kept very it

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:19.860 
saw how it landed and it kept very it
kept<00:03:17.140> very<00:03:17.410> stable<00:03:17.860> and<00:03:18.580> it<00:03:18.730> didn't<00:03:19.030> tilt<00:03:19.630> over

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:19.870 
kept very stable and it didn't tilt over

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:23.340 
kept very stable and it didn't tilt over
but<00:03:20.800> had<00:03:21.010> it<00:03:21.220> tilted<00:03:21.580> over<00:03:21.810> one<00:03:22.810> thing<00:03:23.019> that

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:23.350 
but had it tilted over one thing that

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:25.650 
but had it tilted over one thing that
you<00:03:23.500> will<00:03:23.650> notice<00:03:23.830> on<00:03:24.100> this<00:03:24.340> are<00:03:25.150> these<00:03:25.390> quick

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:25.660 
you will notice on this are these quick

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:28.199 
you will notice on this are these quick
disconnect<00:03:26.140> prop<00:03:26.319> guards<00:03:26.819> and<00:03:27.819> these<00:03:28.060> are

00:03:28.199 --> 00:03:28.209 
disconnect prop guards and these are

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:30.420 
disconnect prop guards and these are
something<00:03:28.450> that<00:03:28.600> if<00:03:28.810> it<00:03:28.930> did<00:03:29.140> topple<00:03:29.739> over<00:03:30.040> in

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:30.430 
something that if it did topple over in

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:33.420 
something that if it did topple over in
landing<00:03:31.269> especially<00:03:31.660> on<00:03:31.750> a<00:03:31.780> small<00:03:32.050> boat<00:03:32.430> that

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:33.430 
landing especially on a small boat that

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:36.360 
landing especially on a small boat that
they<00:03:33.550> may<00:03:33.730> better<00:03:34.030> prevent<00:03:34.630> the<00:03:35.470> the<00:03:35.500> Phantom

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:36.370 
they may better prevent the the Phantom

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:39.000 
they may better prevent the the Phantom
3<00:03:36.400> from<00:03:36.730> breaking<00:03:37.030> a<00:03:37.090> prop<00:03:37.410> so<00:03:38.410> these<00:03:38.680> things

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:39.010 
3 from breaking a prop so these things

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:41.699 
3 from breaking a prop so these things
from<00:03:40.000> a<00:03:40.060> cost<00:03:40.330> perspective<00:03:40.709> there's

00:03:41.699 --> 00:03:41.709 
from a cost perspective there's

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:43.890 
from a cost perspective there's
something<00:03:42.160> that<00:03:42.190> in<00:03:42.430> my<00:03:42.459> opinion<00:03:42.730> it's<00:03:43.720> a

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:43.900 
something that in my opinion it's a

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:46.410 
something that in my opinion it's a
necessity<00:03:44.079> because<00:03:44.890> one<00:03:45.850> pair<00:03:46.090> of<00:03:46.209> prop

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:46.420 
necessity because one pair of prop

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:50.729 
necessity because one pair of prop
guards<00:03:46.870> is<00:03:47.079> likely<00:03:48.040> going<00:03:48.250> to<00:03:48.340> prolong<00:03:49.739> the

00:03:50.729 --> 00:03:50.739 
guards is likely going to prolong the

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:52.620 
guards is likely going to prolong the
life<00:03:51.370> of<00:03:51.549> the<00:03:51.640> props<00:03:51.880> and<00:03:52.060> if<00:03:52.180> you<00:03:52.269> look<00:03:52.480> at<00:03:52.570> the

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:52.630 
life of the props and if you look at the

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:54.060 
life of the props and if you look at the
price<00:03:52.840> of<00:03:52.989> the<00:03:53.079> props<00:03:53.290> in<00:03:53.410> the<00:03:53.470> prop<00:03:53.709> guards

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:54.070 
price of the props in the prop guards

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:56.640 
price of the props in the prop guards
it's<00:03:54.519> a<00:03:54.640> no-brainer<00:03:54.820> in<00:03:55.269> my<00:03:55.390> book<00:03:55.660> and<00:03:55.900> as<00:03:56.500> you

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:56.650 
it's a no-brainer in my book and as you

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:59.100 
it's a no-brainer in my book and as you
saw<00:03:56.860> with<00:03:57.070> in<00:03:57.160> this<00:03:57.280> video<00:03:57.610> sure<00:03:58.540> you<00:03:58.780> can<00:03:58.959> get

saw with in this video sure you can get

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:01.470 
saw with in this video sure you can get
the<00:03:59.200> prop<00:03:59.410> guards<00:03:59.739> in<00:03:59.890> the<00:04:00.010> frame<00:04:00.250> sure<00:04:01.180> you

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:01.480 
the prop guards in the frame sure you

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:04.560 
the prop guards in the frame sure you
can<00:04:01.660> get<00:04:01.780> the<00:04:01.900> props<00:04:02.140> in<00:04:02.380> the<00:04:02.440> frame<00:04:02.910> but<00:04:03.910> if

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:04.570 
can get the props in the frame but if

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:06.509 
can get the props in the frame but if
you<00:04:04.780> know<00:04:04.959> how<00:04:05.110> to<00:04:05.170> control<00:04:05.380> your<00:04:05.620> gimbal<00:04:06.040> you

00:04:06.509 --> 00:04:06.519 
you know how to control your gimbal you

00:04:06.519 --> 00:04:08.100 
you know how to control your gimbal you
can<00:04:06.670> fly<00:04:06.880> and<00:04:07.090> never<00:04:07.269> have<00:04:07.480> a<00:04:07.510> prop<00:04:07.750> guard<00:04:07.959> in

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:08.110 
can fly and never have a prop guard in

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:10.020 
can fly and never have a prop guard in
the<00:04:08.200> frame<00:04:08.410> so<00:04:08.859> thanks<00:04:09.579> again<00:04:09.760> for<00:04:09.970> watching
