00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:05.120
 to 

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:07.690
 A) Yes 

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:16.299
 and I have said it to bullets that you are 

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:18.070
 here we are in my channel my new channel 

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:19.960
 alfonso 3g says although change channel 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:21.640
 nothing will change the style you see 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:23.110
 I bring you my mancada we will continue with what 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:25.150
 same and we will continue with the benches 

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:26.320
 we will continue with the troll book we will continue 

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:27.700
 with the guides I will continue doing 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:29.470
 exactly the same thing he did instead and 

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:31.060
 friends but from now on you will see it 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:32.650
 in this channel if you want to continue watching 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:34.300
 what I did instead and press here you have 

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:35.950
 and of course we will continue with my 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:38.650
 I'm still a damn manco 

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:40.300
 we started with episode 4 and what better than 

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:42.040
 start learning something having some 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:43.450
 vital experience is important to know 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:45.399
 win and know how to lose in this life and 

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:47.469
 especially if you're so bad that you 're not 

00:00:45.399 --> 00:00:49.420
 able to give him a fucking 21 bullet 

00:00:47.469 --> 00:00:50.980
 not one then what you owe 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:52.750
 to do is to die with a little bit of honor 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:54.670
 giving even a gift takes the first aid kit 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:56.140
 for you it's mine but you get the gift as 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:57.789
 you are much better than me and I am a damn 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:59.980
 Manco a game to see how I can fail 

00:00:57.789 --> 00:01:01.570
 so many bullets but let's leave my 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:02.829
 uselessness aside and let's talk about bat 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:04.540
 the filter we know that you will have a your 

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:06.070
 very realistic game tried to approach what 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:07.630
 maximum possible to reality but to me 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:09.700
 I am interested in knowing something I would be interested 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:11.230
 know what happens if we shoot a slope 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:12.940
 through a crystal, of course 

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:14.470
 you will stamp on the clear face 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:16.520
 that if now the meters have crystals 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:18.380
 provided of course 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:20.000
 but not all are man every style something 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:21.770
 of quality I have ever I am able to 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.420
 kill 12 enemies you know I'm with 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:25.670
 abc 7 I will kill and a little bit of 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:27.140
 caliber 4 6 for him you see that I do not have 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:28.640
 bullets I only have 9 bullets left I 'm going to 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:31.280
 burst that shot a perfect management 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:32.869
 but attentive salamanca of the game I leave 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:34.789
 flying like 5 meters I do not commit suicide 

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:36.590
 miracle mates citrÃ­cola from 443 

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:38.119
 quickly but what surprises me most 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:39.560
 is that my medicine cabinet has been changed 

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:42.049
 change the kit for a trampoline 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:43.909
 the sonic uncle as you all know in 

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:45.619
 youtube there are multiple tutorial guides 

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:47.000
 etcetera that explain how to play this 

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:48.439
 damn game but that does not fit this is 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.450
 a tutorial on how to spur and not 

00:01:48.439 --> 00:01:51.979
 committing suicide only to never see 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:53.750
 because I never saw it and it's that you see 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:55.220
 which is very important to answer is very 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:56.689
 important to know where to do it because 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:58.700
 many people respond in the middle of a 

00:01:56.689 --> 00:02:00.409
 battle and with bazooka two shots 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:01.729
 all grenades can make you fall if 

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:03.349
 puts you to is a success and you see that to me 

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:04.789
 I love the philosophy of you live fast 

00:02:03.349 --> 00:02:06.709
 and dies young sure authentic this 

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:08.149
 rockwell are going to do the same site as 

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:10.220
 balconing and in the end I eat a pomegranate 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:11.930
 that was not for me and idiot for not 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:14.420
 know where to expose by going from ready to 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:15.980
 end of wall twice but not everything goes 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:17.329
 to be bancadas mine no I am also 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:19.069
 able to do something other than 

00:02:17.329 --> 00:02:20.750
 is turbon directly in the face of 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:22.550
 this payment very very easy you have victim 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:24.860
 of my 70's there were a lot more 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:26.870
