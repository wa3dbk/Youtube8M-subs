goner let's go with that in die rise
fling<00:00:55.110> 10<00:00:55.379> zombies<00:00:55.829> in<00:00:55.949> one<00:00:56.100> game<00:00:56.309> so<00:00:56.520> I<00:00:56.550> really

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
fling 10 zombies in one game so I really

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.310 
fling 10 zombies in one game so I really
have<00:00:56.969> no<00:00:57.090> idea<00:00:57.120> what<00:00:57.449> this<00:00:57.570> means<00:00:57.629> i<00:00:58.050> think

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
have no idea what this means i think

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.590 
have no idea what this means i think
that<00:00:59.100> on<00:00:59.309> shi<00:00:59.579> no<00:00:59.670> numa<00:00:59.699> there's<00:01:00.180> the<00:01:00.420> thing

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
that on shi no numa there's the thing

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:01.939 
that on shi no numa there's the thing
called<00:01:00.809> the<00:01:00.840> flinger<00:01:01.320> I<00:01:01.500> think<00:01:01.680> that's<00:01:01.770> what's

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
called the flinger I think that's what's

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:03.490 
called the flinger I think that's what's
called<00:01:02.160> so<00:01:02.370> maybe<00:01:02.579> that<00:01:02.789> will<00:01:02.910> be<00:01:03.030> returning

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:03.500 
called so maybe that will be returning

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:06.500 
called so maybe that will be returning
mad<00:01:04.500> without<00:01:04.860> power<00:01:05.400> and<00:01:05.790> die<00:01:06.030> rise<00:01:06.270> reach

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
mad without power and die rise reach

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.929 
mad without power and die rise reach
around<00:01:06.750> 10<00:01:06.930> before<00:01:07.260> turning<00:01:07.590> on<00:01:07.650> the<00:01:07.830> power<00:01:07.939> so

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
around 10 before turning on the power so

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.520 
around 10 before turning on the power so
cool<00:01:09.390> we<00:01:09.510> get<00:01:09.630> a<00:01:09.659> power<00:01:09.869> switch<00:01:10.049> so<00:01:10.290> that's<00:01:10.439> a

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
cool we get a power switch so that's a

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.130 
cool we get a power switch so that's a
good<00:01:10.650> thing<00:01:11.000> shafted<00:01:12.000> and<00:01:12.210> die<00:01:12.390> rise<00:01:12.630> use<00:01:12.840> pack

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
shot from the sliquifier now this is one

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:30.410 
shot from the sliquifier now this is one
of<00:01:29.340> the<00:01:29.430> ones<00:01:29.549> that<00:01:29.729> I<00:01:29.850> wanted<00:01:30.119> to<00:01:30.210> talk<00:01:30.390> about

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
of the ones that I wanted to talk about

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.810 
of the ones that I wanted to talk about
a<00:01:30.659> lot<00:01:31.049> because<00:01:31.290> the<00:01:31.710> sliquifier<00:01:32.100> sounds<00:01:32.670> like

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
a lot because the sliquifier sounds like

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.999 
a lot because the sliquifier sounds like
the<00:01:33.030> new<00:01:33.270> Wonder<00:01:33.630> weapon<00:01:33.750> and<00:01:34.079> to<00:01:34.799> me<00:01:34.920> it

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
the new Wonder weapon and to me it

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.170 
the new Wonder weapon and to me it
sounds<00:01:35.280> something<00:01:35.400> like<00:01:35.520> you<00:01:35.759> know<00:01:35.790> water

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
sounds something like you know water

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.030 
sounds something like you know water
like<00:01:36.540> a<00:01:36.570> water<00:01:36.869> gun<00:01:37.259> or<00:01:37.439> something<00:01:37.470> kind<00:01:37.979> of

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
like a water gun or something kind of

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.440 
like a water gun or something kind of
like<00:01:38.189> the<00:01:38.310> jet<00:01:38.520> gun<00:01:38.670> in<00:01:38.820> a<00:01:38.880> way<00:01:39.000> but<00:01:39.060> it<00:01:39.270> shoots

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
like the jet gun in a way but it shoots

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.569 
like the jet gun in a way but it shoots
water<00:01:39.720> I<00:01:40.049> mean<00:01:40.740> obviously<00:01:41.189> it's<00:01:41.310> not<00:01:41.340> gonna<00:01:41.490> be

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
water I mean obviously it's not gonna be

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:42.530 
water I mean obviously it's not gonna be
the<00:01:41.610> jet<00:01:41.820> gun<00:01:41.939> because<00:01:42.119> you<00:01:42.210> don't<00:01:42.329> have<00:01:42.450> to

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
the jet gun because you don't have to

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:43.399 
the jet gun because you don't have to
build<00:01:42.750> it<00:01:42.869> because<00:01:42.960> it's<00:01:43.140> going<00:01:43.259> to<00:01:43.320> be<00:01:43.380> a

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
build it because it's going to be a

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:44.899 
build it because it's going to be a
Wonder<00:01:43.710> weapon<00:01:43.799> that<00:01:44.040> you<00:01:44.130> probably<00:01:44.399> get<00:01:44.759> from

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
the box so look out for that because

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.429 
the box so look out for that because
that<00:01:48.240> may<00:01:48.479> be<00:01:48.540> the<00:01:48.659> new<00:01:48.869> Wonder<00:01:49.079> weapon<00:01:49.170> I'm
