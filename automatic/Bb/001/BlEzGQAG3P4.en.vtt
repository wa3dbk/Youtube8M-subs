enemy<00:01:09.450> I<00:01:09.750> mean<00:01:10.110> a<00:01:10.350> DNA<00:01:10.770> a<00:01:12.680> F<00:01:13.680> sharp

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:27.740 

in<00:01:16.860> version<00:01:17.220> of<00:01:17.460> the<00:01:17.549> gene<00:01:17.729> is<00:01:20.119> intro<00:01:26.750> that

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
in version of the gene is intro that

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:34.219 
in version of the gene is intro that
inversion<00:01:28.200> is<00:01:30.890> ok<00:01:31.890> so<00:01:32.400> that's<00:01:32.970> the<00:01:33.330> intro<00:01:34.200> to

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
inversion is ok so that's the intro to

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.440 
inversion is ok so that's the intro to
die<00:01:34.770> sometimes<00:01:35.670> I<00:01:35.759> just<00:01:35.850> like<00:01:35.970> playing<00:01:36.180> that

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
die sometimes I just like playing that

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.389 
die sometimes I just like playing that
you<00:01:36.630> know<00:01:36.750> for<00:01:37.050> fun<00:01:37.229> it's<00:01:37.380> just<00:01:37.560> it<00:01:38.070> is<00:01:38.159> very

00:01:38.389 --> 00:01:38.399 
you know for fun it's just it is very

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:44.719 
you know for fun it's just it is very
fun<00:01:41.240> um<00:01:42.240> ok<00:01:43.200> then<00:01:43.409> the<00:01:43.530> baseline<00:01:44.040> right<00:01:44.369> after

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
fun um ok then the baseline right after

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:58.639 
fun um ok then the baseline right after
you<00:01:44.820> hit<00:01:45.060> that<00:01:45.350> is<00:01:55.190> sharp<00:01:56.190> G<00:01:56.700> very<00:01:57.179> simple<00:01:57.649> so

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
you hit that is sharp G very simple so

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:02.889 
you hit that is sharp G very simple so
um<00:02:00.679> if<00:02:01.679> I<00:02:01.800> could<00:02:01.950> find<00:02:02.039> a<00:02:02.159> good<00:02:02.190> angle<00:02:02.429> here

00:02:02.889 --> 00:02:02.899 
um if I could find a good angle here

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:19.390 
um if I could find a good angle here
alright<00:02:03.899> so<00:02:04.229> it's

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.560 

you<00:02:20.400> can<00:02:20.550> repeat<00:02:20.760> that<00:02:20.880> as<00:02:21.030> many<00:02:21.180> times<00:02:21.450> you

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:21.570 
you can repeat that as many times you

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:28.370 
you can repeat that as many times you
want<00:02:21.600> it's<00:02:21.990> just<00:02:22.230> you<00:02:22.470> know<00:02:22.590> d<00:02:23.010> e<00:02:23.040> f<00:02:23.640> sharp<00:02:24.000> g
