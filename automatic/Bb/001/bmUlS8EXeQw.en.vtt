00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
evolution so we have to do back all the

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:49.969 
evolution so we have to do back all the
way<00:01:48.540> the<00:01:48.630> left<00:01:48.930> in<00:01:49.229> the<00:01:49.380> middle<00:01:49.500> of<00:01:49.649> its<00:01:49.740> gold

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.700 
way the left in the middle of its gold
bat<00:01:50.189> and<00:01:50.759> that's<00:01:50.909> a<00:01:51.110> crow<00:01:52.110> bat

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
bat and that's a crow bat

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.420

why<00:01:53.640> Zubat<00:01:54.479> very<00:01:54.930> weak<00:01:55.170> gold<00:01:55.680> bat<00:01:55.890> very<00:01:56.189> weak

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
why Zubat very weak gold bat very weak

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.340 
why Zubat very weak gold bat very weak
crobat<00:01:56.939> amazingly<00:01:57.450> awesome<00:01:57.750> and<00:01:58.140> the<00:01:58.200> most

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
crobat amazingly awesome and the most

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.590 
crobat amazingly awesome and the most
probably<00:01:58.680> the<00:01:58.740> most<00:01:58.829> best<00:01:59.369> pokemon<00:02:00.329> in<00:02:00.479> the

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
probably the most best pokemon in the

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.429 
probably the most best pokemon in the
plasma<00:02:00.810> store<00:02:01.460> so<00:02:02.460> why<00:02:03.329> I<00:02:03.360> got<00:02:04.079> this<00:02:04.259> is

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
plasma store so why I got this is

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:07.249 
plasma store so why I got this is
because<00:02:04.469> night<00:02:05.159> side<00:02:05.549> which<00:02:05.820> is<00:02:05.939> nice<00:02:06.180> um<00:02:06.570> you
