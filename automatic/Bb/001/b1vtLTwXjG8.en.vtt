00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:12.790
 the big day arrived in paris the opening of 

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:15.580
 fiac 

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:17.890
 this is the red carpet of art one of 

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:22.440
 the four fantastic art fairs 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:26.430
 contemporary and I confess my favorite 

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:27.780
 with it the great dilemma that I'm going to 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.850
 put 

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:33.120
 and is that Paris has its codes of 

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:35.570
 wardrobe but the art paris is even more 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.570
 peculiar 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:46.900
 all 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.100
 all right 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:59.990
 you have to hit with a chic outfit 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:04.360
 fashion but that in turn transmit 

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:04.360
 seriousness without getting away from the avant-garde 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:10.030
 but it is not enough to dress well now 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:12.160
 let's let the grand palais us 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:14.100
 open your mind and go for a bath 

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:16.650
 culture 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.750
 the home is worth this iconic monument 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:21.509
 that carries so much history behind them 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:25.430
 once a year it becomes the best 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:25.430
 host of contemporary art 

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:29.969
 ah 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:36.570
 first stop one of my galleries 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:38.130
 favorites the Mexican kurimanzutto is 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.470
 gallery by the hand of the great artist 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.900
 gabriel orozco has achieved that some 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:46.190
 Mexican artists go to the category 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:46.190
 from other 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:19.290
 and exciting are in a gallery and not 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:21.780
 know where to look to have that encounter 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:23.490
 with established artists and being 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:25.590
 in front of a piece that surely 

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:28.140
 next week will be in one of the 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:31.280
 most important museums in the world and it will be 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:31.280
 visited by millions of people 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:41.500
 contemporary art is not made with 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:44.530
 a decorative goal contemporary art 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:47.140
 it's conceptual there are pieces that were born 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:49.270
 to live in a museum there are pieces that 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:51.670
 They are here to question us 

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:54.270
 important is to evolve hand in hand with 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:54.270
 the artists 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:11.280
 and 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:41.019
 you do not have to feel intimidated you have to 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:41.019
 enjoy and be seduced visually 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:20.810
 I go with the more open mind 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:24.450
 more awake senses full of ideas 

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:26.310
 the artists are the interpreters that we 

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:28.170
 help to communicate with the society of 

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:30.480
 today, how important it is to understand 

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:32.310
 society of which you are part for 

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:34.890
 to be able to understand yourself the man 

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:38.420
 before speaking I painted the art 

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:38.420
 he has always accompanied us
