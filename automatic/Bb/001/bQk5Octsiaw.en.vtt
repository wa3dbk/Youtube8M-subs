 thrones fury of the kings storm 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:04.830
 swords from the other side wearing the 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.119
 ravens and dragons dancing ahead of them 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.299
 They are not here that I took to stay. 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:11.670
 easier to show you is 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:13.380
 starting here by the book 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.750
 five books of this edition have this 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:18.479
 side of a single color that is that brown 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:21.570
 dark only the front cover of each 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:24.840
 book has a different color is book 1 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:26.189
 he has this lighter brown tournament 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.100
 in relation to the lateral 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:31.979
 book 2 it's green 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:35.220
 It's green, you can tell a little. 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:38.130
 different when you see from the side and 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:41.040
 Book 35 in my opinion was more 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:44.040
 Beautiful blue, you can notice a lot. 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.570
 difference from lateral and these 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.579
 golden effects when you kinda 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:50.119
 beats the Portuguese gives one reflection was 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:53.610
 Pretty nice book 4 and it's cool 

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:55.829
 He turned red, you can tell. 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:58.259
 difference can also be seen from the side 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:02:01.170
 book 5 has not changed much in relation to 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:02.670
 to book one in relation to the side remained 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:06.630
 more or less of that color 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:09.270
 does not change much now that the show 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:11.360
 leaves, the leaves are much finer in 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:13.560
 relation to the normal edition 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:15.450
 so why 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.459
 nor does it have to fit into the extinction issue as well 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:20.040
 little for you and for the palm of my 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:24.060
 hand is the size of my palm is 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:26.010
 It's quite small and it's good because it 's worth it 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:28.709
 It's worth it because you're going to take it to 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:30.030
 a place to travel is much more practical 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:33.510
 to take you from one place to another 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:36.390
 it's much more practical, it's cool and the mission 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:38.010
 It's small house anywhere. 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:42.480
 It's a lesson that, in my opinion, 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:44.340
 quite worth is so personal that was 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:48.060

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:50.730
