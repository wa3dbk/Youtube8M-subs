00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
little too basic not really interesting

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.759

DMP<00:00:31.500> 11<00:00:31.859> which<00:00:31.980> i'm<00:00:32.130> sure<00:00:32.160> a<00:00:32.279> lot<00:00:32.460> of<00:00:32.520> people

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
DMP 11 which i'm sure a lot of people

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.370 
DMP 11 which i'm sure a lot of people
are<00:00:32.940> gonna<00:00:33.059> fuss<00:00:33.390> about<00:00:33.600> the<00:00:33.780> fact<00:00:33.960> these<00:00:34.170> two

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
are gonna fuss about the fact these two

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.280 
are gonna fuss about the fact these two
Cowboys<00:00:34.800> are<00:00:34.920> so<00:00:35.100> similar<00:00:35.510> and<00:00:36.510> a<00:00:37.110> lot<00:00:37.260> of

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
Cowboys are so similar and a lot of

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:38.630 
Cowboys are so similar and a lot of
people<00:00:37.469> actually<00:00:37.680> group<00:00:37.980> them<00:00:38.160> together<00:00:38.309> I

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
people actually group them together I

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.240 
people actually group them together I
don't<00:00:38.820> I<00:00:39.390> do<00:00:39.480> think<00:00:39.989> the<00:00:40.410> small<00:00:40.739> differences

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
don't I do think the small differences

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.389 
don't I do think the small differences
like<00:00:41.520> having<00:00:41.820> the<00:00:41.910> gold<00:00:42.149> jump<00:00:42.420> man<00:00:42.629> I<00:00:43.399> really

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
like having the gold jump man I really

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.760 
like having the gold jump man I really
adds<00:00:44.789> like<00:00:45.059> another<00:00:45.329> accent<00:00:45.989> that<00:00:46.230> I<00:00:46.260> think<00:00:46.500> I

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
adds like another accent that I think I

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.139 
adds like another accent that I think I
think<00:00:47.129> just<00:00:47.309> brings<00:00:47.520> a<00:00:47.610> little<00:00:47.850> bit<00:00:47.969> more

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
think just brings a little bit more

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.840 
think just brings a little bit more
personality<00:00:48.600> to<00:00:49.020> the<00:00:49.110> shoe<00:00:49.320> um<00:00:49.620> but<00:00:50.579> otherwise

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
personality to the shoe um but otherwise

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.729 
personality to the shoe um but otherwise
they're<00:00:51.210> pretty<00:00:51.420> much<00:00:51.449> the<00:00:51.660> same<00:00:51.840> clearly<00:00:52.410> the

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
they're pretty much the same clearly the

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.529 
they're pretty much the same clearly the
this<00:00:53.340> and<00:00:53.489> the<00:00:53.550> Conchords<00:00:54.059> are<00:00:54.149> very<00:00:54.329> similar

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
this and the Conchords are very similar

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.689 
this and the Conchords are very similar
but<00:00:54.840> I<00:00:55.020> think<00:00:55.260> these<00:00:55.379> are<00:00:55.440> slightly<00:00:56.100> slightly

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
but I think these are slightly slightly

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.660 
but I think these are slightly slightly
better<00:00:56.969> but<00:00:57.270> um<00:00:57.870> yeah<00:00:58.859> that's<00:00:59.219> why<00:00:59.370> I<00:00:59.399> chose

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
better but um yeah that's why I chose

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.340 
better but um yeah that's why I chose
these<00:00:59.879> but<00:01:00.149> for<00:01:00.600> number<00:01:00.809> three<00:01:00.989> I<00:01:01.020> have<00:01:01.230> the

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
these but for number three I have the

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.529 
these but for number three I have the
bread<00:01:01.620> Elevens<00:01:02.039> now<00:01:02.730> this<00:01:03.120> is<00:01:03.300> a<00:01:03.329> great

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
Jordans but there's one big reason I

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.460 
Jordans but there's one big reason I
chose<00:01:08.880> this<00:01:09.150> as<00:01:09.210> my<00:01:09.479> number<00:01:09.540> three<00:01:09.960> slot<00:01:10.110> and

chose this as my number three slot and

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.000 
chose this as my number three slot and
that's<00:01:10.799> the<00:01:11.400> fact<00:01:11.640> that<00:01:11.820> this<00:01:12.030> is<00:01:12.240> a<00:01:12.650> jordan<00:01:13.650> 11

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
that's the fact that this is a jordan 11

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.310 
that's the fact that this is a jordan 11
without<00:01:14.220> an<00:01:14.520> icy<00:01:15.119> bottom<00:01:15.509> and<00:01:15.630> of<00:01:15.960> course<00:01:16.170> it's
