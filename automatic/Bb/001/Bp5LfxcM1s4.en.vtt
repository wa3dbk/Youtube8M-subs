where<00:02:26.980> the<00:02:27.099> blind<00:02:27.310> spot<00:02:27.610> was<00:02:27.880> we<00:02:28.569> thought<00:02:28.810> it

00:02:29.009 --> 00:02:29.019 
where the blind spot was we thought it

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:31.770 
where the blind spot was we thought it
was<00:02:29.140> to<00:02:29.410> the<00:02:29.890> rear<00:02:30.130> of<00:02:30.160> the<00:02:30.310> mirrors<00:02:30.780> then

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.780 
was to the rear of the mirrors then

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:34.140 
was to the rear of the mirrors then
moving<00:02:32.260> the<00:02:32.500> car<00:02:32.709> forward<00:02:33.069> we<00:02:33.640> found<00:02:33.880> that<00:02:34.060> it

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
moving the car forward we found that it

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:35.789 
moving the car forward we found that it
was<00:02:34.239> actually<00:02:34.390> level<00:02:35.079> with<00:02:35.200> the<00:02:35.319> cab<00:02:35.530> and

00:02:35.789 --> 00:02:35.799 
was actually level with the cab and

00:02:35.799 --> 00:02:37.710 
was actually level with the cab and
slightly<00:02:36.099> forward<00:02:36.549> of<00:02:36.640> the<00:02:36.730> cab<00:02:36.940> and<00:02:37.120> the

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:37.720 
slightly forward of the cab and the

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:38.849 
slightly forward of the cab and the
vehicle<00:02:38.049> just<00:02:38.200> disappeared<00:02:38.680> from<00:02:38.769> the

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:38.859 
vehicle just disappeared from the

00:02:38.859 --> 00:02:41.430 
vehicle just disappeared from the
mirrors<00:02:39.359> what<00:02:40.359> we<00:02:40.450> did<00:02:40.630> to<00:02:40.720> progress<00:02:41.049> that<00:02:41.230> we

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:41.440 
mirrors what we did to progress that we

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:43.229 
mirrors what we did to progress that we
went<00:02:41.620> out<00:02:41.709> on<00:02:41.739> some<00:02:42.010> roadside<00:02:42.400> checks<00:02:42.880> and

00:02:43.229 --> 00:02:43.239 
went out on some roadside checks and

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:45.509 
went out on some roadside checks and
phone<00:02:43.900> at<00:02:44.049> the<00:02:44.139> blind<00:02:44.380> spot<00:02:44.680> occurred<00:02:45.010> in<00:02:45.220> 90%

00:02:45.509 --> 00:02:45.519

of<00:02:45.880> all<00:02:46.030> vehicles<00:02:46.889> from<00:02:47.889> there<00:02:48.100> we<00:02:48.190> were

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:48.340 
of all vehicles from there we were

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:50.819 
of all vehicles from there we were
tasked<00:02:48.760> with<00:02:48.790> how<00:02:49.600> to<00:02:49.660> actually<00:02:50.260> eradicate

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:50.829 
tasked with how to actually eradicate

00:02:50.829 --> 00:02:53.069 
tasked with how to actually eradicate
that<00:02:51.160> problem<00:02:51.670> and<00:02:52.269> we<00:02:52.420> came<00:02:52.600> up<00:02:52.630> with<00:02:52.810> this

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:53.079 
that problem and we came up with this

00:02:53.079 --> 00:02:55.770 
that problem and we came up with this
Fresnel<00:02:53.709> lens<00:02:53.920> from<00:02:54.819> the<00:02:54.880> normal<00:02:55.359> Fresnel

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:55.780 
Fresnel lens from the normal Fresnel

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:57.660 
Fresnel lens from the normal Fresnel
lens<00:02:55.959> which<00:02:56.139> is<00:02:56.170> fitted<00:02:56.590> to<00:02:56.620> motorhomes<00:02:57.430> and

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:57.670 
lens which is fitted to motorhomes and

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:00.720 
lens which is fitted to motorhomes and
caravans<00:02:58.170> for<00:02:59.170> reversing<00:02:59.709> we<00:03:00.280> took<00:03:00.489> their

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:00.730 
caravans for reversing we took their

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:03.059 
caravans for reversing we took their
idea<00:03:01.180> and<00:03:01.389> we<00:03:01.720> actually<00:03:01.900> moved<00:03:02.410> the<00:03:02.680> center<00:03:02.889> of

00:03:03.059 --> 00:03:03.069 
idea and we actually moved the center of

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:05.069 
idea and we actually moved the center of
the<00:03:03.160> lens<00:03:03.340> up<00:03:03.609> to<00:03:03.730> the<00:03:03.850> top<00:03:04.090> since<00:03:04.720> we<00:03:04.870> had<00:03:05.049> a

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:05.079 
the lens up to the top since we had a

00:03:05.079 --> 00:03:07.500 
the lens up to the top since we had a
lot<00:03:05.290> better<00:03:05.530> dangling<00:03:06.040> vision<00:03:06.400> and<00:03:07.180> we<00:03:07.299> found

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:07.510 
lot better dangling vision and we found

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:10.009 
lot better dangling vision and we found
out<00:03:07.690> that<00:03:07.810> it<00:03:08.350> writer<00:03:08.530> caves<00:03:08.799> the<00:03:08.980> problem

00:03:10.009 --> 00:03:10.019 
out that it writer caves the problem

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:12.809 
out that it writer caves the problem
we've<00:03:11.019> set<00:03:11.260> up<00:03:11.380> a<00:03:11.500> demonstration<00:03:11.680> here<00:03:12.519> at<00:03:12.700> the

00:03:12.809 --> 00:03:12.819 
we've set up a demonstration here at the

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:14.699 
we've set up a demonstration here at the
fire<00:03:13.060> service<00:03:13.480> college<00:03:13.720> on<00:03:14.049> their<00:03:14.290> motorway

fire service college on their motorway
section<00:03:15.389> we've<00:03:16.389> got<00:03:16.599> a<00:03:16.630> new<00:03:16.870> truck<00:03:17.139> to<00:03:17.470> the

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:17.590 
section we've got a new truck to the

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:19.500 
section we've got a new truck to the
latest<00:03:17.920> specification<00:03:18.700> including<00:03:19.389> the

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:19.510 
latest specification including the

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:23.440 
latest specification including the
mirrors

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:23.450 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:26.570 

the<00:03:24.450> car<00:03:24.690> will<00:03:24.990> slowly<00:03:25.320> pass<00:03:25.710> the<00:03:25.950> truck<00:03:26.220> which

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:26.580 
the car will slowly pass the truck which

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:29.870 
the car will slowly pass the truck which
is<00:03:26.610> left-hand<00:03:27.270> drive<00:03:27.570> as<00:03:28.100> you<00:03:29.100> can<00:03:29.430> see<00:03:29.640> the

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:29.880 
is left-hand drive as you can see the

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:31.790 
is left-hand drive as you can see the
car<00:03:30.060> passes<00:03:30.510> out<00:03:30.690> of<00:03:30.720> the<00:03:30.870> driver's<00:03:31.320> mirror<00:03:31.560> as

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:31.800 
car passes out of the driver's mirror as

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:40.750 
car passes out of the driver's mirror as
it<00:03:31.980> enters<00:03:32.280> the<00:03:32.460> blind<00:03:32.700> spot

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:40.760 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:54.750 

let's<00:03:41.569> look<00:03:41.750> at<00:03:41.870> that<00:03:42.019> again

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:54.760 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:57.940 

the<00:03:55.760> solution<00:03:56.299> is<00:03:56.480> a<00:03:56.540> plastic<00:03:57.170> stick<00:03:57.500> on<00:03:57.650> lens

00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:57.950 
the solution is a plastic stick on lens

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:00.940 
the solution is a plastic stick on lens
known<00:03:58.579> as<00:03:58.790> a<00:03:58.819> Fresnel<00:03:59.329> lens<00:03:59.599> well<00:04:00.560> it<00:04:00.650> fit<00:04:00.859> the
