game open-world for you to web sling

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.540 
game open-world for you to web sling
around<00:00:25.680> as<00:00:26.099> spider-man<00:00:26.519> but<00:00:27.000> a<00:00:28.400> game<00:00:29.400> like

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
around as spider-man but a game like

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.700 
around as spider-man but a game like
this<00:00:29.609> was<00:00:29.970> meant<00:00:30.240> to<00:00:30.630> be<00:00:31.170> played<00:00:31.320> with<00:00:31.439> the

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
this was meant to be played with the

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:37.700 
this was meant to be played with the
controller<00:00:32.149> not<00:00:33.149> a<00:00:34.430> touchscreen<00:00:35.630> so<00:00:36.710> swinging

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
controller not a touchscreen so swinging

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.560 
controller not a touchscreen so swinging
around<00:00:37.829> is<00:00:38.489> actually<00:00:39.210> kind<00:00:39.420> of<00:00:39.510> difficult

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
around is actually kind of difficult

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.600 
around is actually kind of difficult
especially<00:00:40.140> when<00:00:40.500> you<00:00:40.620> want<00:00:41.100> to<00:00:41.250> maneuver

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
especially when you want to maneuver

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.240 
especially when you want to maneuver
around<00:00:42.329> because<00:00:42.989> you<00:00:43.140> can<00:00:43.320> kind<00:00:43.559> of<00:00:43.680> move<00:00:44.100> the

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
around because you can kind of move the

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:45.830 
around because you can kind of move the
camera<00:00:44.640> around<00:00:44.700> like<00:00:45.210> if<00:00:45.329> you<00:00:45.420> had<00:00:45.539> three

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
camera around like if you had three

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.450 
camera around like if you had three
hands<00:00:46.320> this<00:00:46.590> game<00:00:46.800> would<00:00:46.950> be<00:00:46.980> perfect

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
hands this game would be perfect

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:48.799 
hands this game would be perfect
especially<00:00:47.550> trying<00:00:48.120> to<00:00:48.180> crawl<00:00:48.390> up<00:00:48.510> a<00:00:48.600> building

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
especially trying to crawl up a building

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.860 
especially trying to crawl up a building
like<00:00:49.020> this<00:00:49.289> and<00:00:49.530> then<00:00:49.620> jump<00:00:49.860> off<00:00:49.980> of<00:00:50.190> it<00:00:50.309> is

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:50.870 
like this and then jump off of it is

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:53.959 
like this and then jump off of it is
really<00:00:51.870> tough<00:00:52.379> especially<00:00:52.649> when<00:00:53.219> you<00:00:53.610> do<00:00:53.760> some

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
really tough especially when you do some

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.900 
really tough especially when you do some
timed<00:00:54.300> missions<00:00:55.340> not<00:00:56.340> only<00:00:56.520> that<00:00:56.640> but<00:00:56.760> this

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
timed missions not only that but this

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.830 
timed missions not only that but this
game<00:00:57.059> I<00:00:57.090> think<00:00:57.239> is<00:00:58.640> $6.99<00:00:59.640> which<00:01:00.239> is<00:01:00.420> quite<00:01:00.809> a

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
game I think is $6.99 which is quite a

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.100 
game I think is $6.99 which is quite a
bit<00:01:01.699> not<00:01:02.699> a<00:01:02.760> terrible<00:01:03.270> amount<00:01:03.480> to<00:01:03.660> play<00:01:03.840> for<00:01:04.080> a

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
bit not a terrible amount to play for a

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.620 
bit not a terrible amount to play for a
game<00:01:04.290> to<00:01:04.769> pay<00:01:04.920> for<00:01:05.129> a<00:01:05.189> game<00:01:05.339> but<00:01:05.610> the<00:01:06.390> amount

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
game to pay for a game but the amount

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.960 
game to pay for a game but the amount
that<00:01:06.720> you<00:01:06.930> get<00:01:07.229> for<00:01:07.530> your<00:01:07.619> $7<00:01:08.310> out<00:01:08.460> of<00:01:08.610> this<00:01:08.760> is

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
that you get for your $7 out of this is

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:14.600 
that you get for your $7 out of this is
not<00:01:09.570> great<00:01:09.869> I'm<00:01:10.770> only<00:01:10.920> level<00:01:11.130> seven<00:01:12.500> I<00:01:13.610> let's

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
not great I'm only level seven I let's

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.310 
not great I'm only level seven I let's
see<00:01:14.820> if<00:01:14.939> I<00:01:15.030> can<00:01:15.210> get<00:01:15.479> to<00:01:15.750> one<00:01:16.080> of<00:01:16.170> these

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
see if I can get to one of these

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.260 
see if I can get to one of these
storyline<00:01:16.920> missions<00:01:17.100> so<00:01:17.520> you<00:01:17.610> can<00:01:17.790> see<00:01:18.060> that

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
storyline missions so you can see that

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:19.550 
storyline missions so you can see that
they<00:01:18.360> might<00:01:18.509> hate<00:01:18.689> the<00:01:18.810> most<00:01:18.990> about<00:01:19.170> this<00:01:19.380> game

supposed<00:03:35.710> to<00:03:35.800> sound<00:03:36.040> like<00:03:36.190> I<00:03:36.760> guess<00:03:37.420> but<00:03:38.020> it

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:38.920 
supposed to sound like I guess but it

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:40.650 
supposed to sound like I guess but it
sounds<00:03:39.190> like<00:03:39.250> you<00:03:39.490> know<00:03:39.580> the<00:03:40.120> developers

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:40.660 
sounds like you know the developers

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:44.910 
sounds like you know the developers
brother-in-law<00:03:41.320> needed<00:03:42.100> a<00:03:42.160> job<00:03:42.400> so<00:03:43.710> they<00:03:44.710> let

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:44.920 
brother-in-law needed a job so they let

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:45.960 
brother-in-law needed a job so they let
him<00:03:45.070> be<00:03:45.310> spider-man

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:45.970

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:49.900 
so here's some of the combat super

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:53.280 
so here's some of the combat super
simple<00:03:51.270> it's<00:03:52.270> kind<00:03:52.450> of<00:03:52.480> like<00:03:52.660> the<00:03:52.810> Batman

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:53.290 
simple it's kind of like the Batman

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:56.130 
simple it's kind of like the Batman
Arkham<00:03:53.590> games<00:03:54.420> where<00:03:55.420> and<00:03:55.630> you<00:03:55.750> know<00:03:55.870> you<00:03:55.930> have

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:56.140 
Arkham games where and you know you have

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:57.450 
Arkham games where and you know you have
your<00:03:56.230> spider<00:03:56.470> sense<00:03:56.560> goes<00:03:56.920> off<00:03:57.100> and<00:03:57.280> then<00:03:57.370> you

00:03:57.450 --> 00:03:57.460 
your spider sense goes off and then you

00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:00.270 
your spider sense goes off and then you
can<00:03:57.520> count<00:03:57.850> on<00:03:57.940> guys<00:03:58.120> and<00:03:58.600> build<00:03:59.200> up<00:03:59.350> insane

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:00.280 
can count on guys and build up insane

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:03.180 
can count on guys and build up insane
combos<00:04:00.550> but<00:04:01.200> this<00:04:02.200> is<00:04:02.350> incredibly<00:04:02.890> simplistic

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:03.190 
combos but this is incredibly simplistic

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:05.210 
combos but this is incredibly simplistic
it<00:04:03.580> doesn't<00:04:03.820> do<00:04:03.910> anything<00:04:04.150> terribly<00:04:04.840> original

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:05.220 
it doesn't do anything terribly original

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:07.830
