00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:03.469
 jazz 

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:09.569
 the socialists is that teenagers 

00:00:09.569 --> 00:00:11.439
 benitez 

00:00:11.439 --> 00:00:14.819
 but it had much more to do with raised flags 

00:00:15.609 --> 00:00:18.609
 sanchez agencies 

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:24.360
 but at the end of each mission 

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:27.560
 after meeting with the mother in command 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:30.560
 one landing was blown against the 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:36.240
 the impacts resounded on the moon like a bell 

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:39.240
 indicating the presence of pulverized rock under the surface 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.150
 reverberating rock 

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:43.720
 the moon and solid 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:45.820
 metallic core 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:50.330
 the astronauts brought more than 380 kilos of rocks to the earth 

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:53.330
 the samples will be volcanic the product of the impacts 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:04.230
 998 and the mission 

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:05.640
 first leaflet 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.840
 induced by these geological maps from a previous survey 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:12.350
 began the search for lunar ice 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:18.370
 this image suggests such a possibility the circle is the basin 

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:19.500
 there he 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.500
 a huge depression in the south pole 

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:28.160
 the prospects' sensors verify suspicions 

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:30.799
 There are those who own millions of tons of water 

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:35.340
 but public frozen and trapped in the rocks the same happens in the pole 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.780
 north 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:42.620
 the last astronauts left the moon in 1972 

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:43.780
 if there is water 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:46.780
 they can return 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:55.120
 the next video we will present a sunrise on Mars 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:56.830
 It was fascinating 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:59.830
 dusty red planet 

00:02:20.229 --> 00:02:21.769
 It is divided 

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:23.409
 to the south 

00:02:23.409 --> 00:02:25.599
 - full of posters in you 

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:26.739
 to the north 

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:29.739
 young plains of water 

00:02:35.559 --> 00:02:39.389
 I knew that dust storms in Mars conjuncture two weeks 

00:02:39.969 --> 00:02:42.969
 completely enveloping the planet 

00:02:47.169 --> 00:02:50.169
 p 

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:52.720
 we will also visit the belt 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:54.129
 an asteroid 

00:02:54.129 --> 00:02:56.999
 Remaining rocks of the birth of the solar system 

00:02:56.999 --> 00:03:00.319
 located between Mars and Jupiter 

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:02.429
 a quiet life but 

00:03:02.429 --> 00:03:05.429
 accidents happen 

00:03:07.119 --> 00:03:08.469
 65 thousand 

00:03:08.469 --> 00:03:10.259
 hoeness of years ago 

00:03:10.259 --> 00:03:13.129
 a rock and metal object of 10 

00:03:13.129 --> 00:03:16.129
 if there on a collision course with the earth 

00:03:23.029 --> 00:03:27.149
 what effect could a pact of one of these asteroids have on the earth 

00:03:31.589 --> 00:03:36.639
 lópez also many other questions télam answer the next day 11
