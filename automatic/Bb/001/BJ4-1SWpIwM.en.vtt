00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.930
 So if you pull it off, it makes a piston sound. 

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:11.540
 It's about this time, but if you get out of here like this, the water will disappear. 

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:15.830
 You can see that there is 

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:19.700
 Yeah, I just fall ill spent a night blooming even going to care about 

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:22.119
 Here's the length here. Fuck that face. Come to the front, 

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:22.119
 Let's wait. 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:32.980
 Hello everyone, this is Mine Craft. 

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:36.969
 c Pull the lever to make disappear from the top when its water fountain Footwear 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:41.530
 Once I'll make small talk with the Jews 

00:00:36.969 --> 00:00:42.519
 Let's take a look at what this lever pulls and basically makes this water disappear. 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:48.160
 I can. 

00:00:42.519 --> 00:00:51.070
 It gosh, this piston something wrong should not you see the original 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:56.110
 It's easy to get away from anything 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:01:00.550
 You should have been informed that this is the way it was supposed to be. 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:01.930
 It's simple. It's really simple. It's enough to see this once. 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:09.000
 There you are. 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:09.000
 I t is, now that the original analysis haebomyeon 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:24.410
 I'm small, I let my oh so I natnya 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:24.410
 There's a chisel bist, but it's just a bistro . 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:28.790
 like this 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:33.020
 Yoga 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:40.960
 And it was originally shaped like this. 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:40.960
 I can not. It's not that simple. I suppose it's water here. 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:50.280
 I've talked to four 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:50.280
 If you pull the lever, 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:06.210
 I pulled four times and it was good. 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:07.380
 This is what happens. Why is it suddenly disappearing? 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:13.080
 I do not know. 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:16.140
 Uh party asked whether Redstone sang also send the original piston front piston 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:18.410
 Can not operate and can be operated separately 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.410
 like this 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:26.220
 I did not have the electricity flowing in this way . 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:30.360
 OU register with water 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:34.950
 If you stick to the back of the piston , keep it on. 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:37.920
 Gonna party with the principle of and something has gotta do this, then let's Lipitor 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:41.310
 The artist's Ceres block will be put in front of the piston. 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:47.550
 Then it works like this . 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:51.600
 And if you want to create characters like Red Piston fountain's danya 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:54.690
 O one and then the red tumbler here in the industry 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:58.560
 Then he puts a piece on top of it. 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:03:03.959
 Two pistons will be pulled up one by one, and two more pistons will work. 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:10.500
 Here too, this is where Beast 1 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:16.760
 And also see the b of the thumb that rusted and here comes the stage 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:22.920
 Here's something like this black fleece . Here's the red tumbler. 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:27.840
 Red tree's gotta do here as well intact and uh black incense stand yoreotge 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:33.540
 That's how it looks like this. 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:37.040
 And if you blow this thing and look inside, there's a piston in it. 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:37.040
 Very simple hops 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:39.329
 I 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:46.659
 Come on. 

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:46.659
 Stop it all. 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:55.190
 Let's dream of a fountain 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:55.190
 Let's decorate the fountain. 

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:11.060
 I do not think it's time to decorate . 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:14.960
 I do not know what to do. 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:21.920
 Now this is the way to go. 

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:24.520
 That'll do the same circular was actually doing what the secret of all cars eyebrows 

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:24.520
 Give 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:29.610
 Frozen version weird 

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:37.240
 Good. Something 's right. 

00:04:33.699 --> 00:04:43.630
 What 's this? 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:48.510
 Let's make Victor work here at least here. 

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:48.510
 So I had better retreat and even forgot to eat you up 

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:52.600
 U 

00:05:03.939 --> 00:05:11.400
 Well , let 's get this level up here , and it'll run out of water . 

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:13.680
 U 

00:05:15.979 --> 00:05:25.380
 Mob. Nothing happened. Well, that's the principle. 

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:25.380
 He forgets to be overwhelmed by the real thing.
