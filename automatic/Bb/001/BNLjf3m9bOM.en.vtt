00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:29.680 
as a transitional color so that's a good

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:32.670 
as a transitional color so that's a good
tip<00:03:29.950> if<00:03:30.640> you<00:03:31.629> know<00:03:31.750> especially<00:03:32.379> with

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:37.060 
of really good transitional shades so

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:38.610 
of really good transitional shades so
sometimes<00:03:37.510> it's<00:03:37.690> good<00:03:37.870> to<00:03:37.900> just<00:03:38.049> use<00:03:38.379> whatever

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:38.620 
sometimes it's good to just use whatever

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:43.550 
sometimes it's good to just use whatever
bronzer<00:03:39.310> you're<00:03:39.459> using<00:03:39.849> for<00:03:40.120> that
