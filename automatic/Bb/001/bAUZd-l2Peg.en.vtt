00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
cards as we explained earlier you're

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.790 
cards as we explained earlier you're
calling<00:00:50.610> the<00:00:51.090> bottom<00:00:51.449> card<00:00:51.719> so<00:00:52.500> you<00:00:52.590> want<00:00:52.739> to

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:19.740 
take a glance at it and you start to

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:21.110 
take a glance at it and you start to
spread<00:02:19.980> out<00:02:20.130> you<00:02:20.280> tell<00:02:20.460> them<00:02:20.610> just<00:02:20.790> to<00:02:20.880> touch

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
spread out you tell them just to touch

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.630

one<00:02:21.450> of<00:02:21.660> the<00:02:21.780> cards<00:02:22.170> whatever<00:02:23.130> card<00:02:23.520> they

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
one of the cards whatever card they

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.680 
one of the cards whatever card they
touch<00:02:23.910> and<00:02:24.300> you<00:02:24.900> cut<00:02:25.110> the<00:02:25.260> deck<00:02:25.440> at<00:02:25.560> that<00:02:25.740> point

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:26.690 
touch and you cut the deck at that point

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:30.800 
touch and you cut the deck at that point
to<00:02:27.690> square<00:02:28.020> up<00:02:28.310> you<00:02:29.310> can<00:02:29.460> even<00:02:29.550> turn<00:02:29.850> away<00:02:30.030> to

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
to square up you can even turn away to

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:34.190 
to square up you can even turn away to
make<00:02:30.960> it<00:02:31.250> more<00:02:32.250> fair<00:02:32.550> for<00:02:32.580> them<00:02:32.970> or<00:02:33.870> so<00:02:34.080> they

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
make it more fair for them or so they

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.010 
make it more fair for them or so they
think<00:02:34.260> and<00:02:34.680> you<00:02:35.520> just<00:02:35.640> turn<00:02:35.910> away<00:02:36.030> and<00:02:36.480> then

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:37.020 
think and you just turn away and then

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:38.600 
think and you just turn away and then
from<00:02:37.170> there<00:02:37.230> you<00:02:37.980> don't<00:02:38.130> even<00:02:38.220> have<00:02:38.370> to<00:02:38.430> look

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
from there you don't even have to look

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:39.860 
from there you don't even have to look
at<00:02:38.760> anything<00:02:38.970> you<00:02:39.150> just<00:02:39.180> set<00:02:39.480> the<00:02:39.540> deck<00:02:39.690> down

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
at anything you just set the deck down

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:41.750 
at anything you just set the deck down
again<00:02:40.500> they<00:02:40.890> can<00:02:41.040> take<00:02:41.190> the<00:02:41.310> cards<00:02:41.580> of<00:02:41.670> this

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
again they can take the cards of this

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.850 
again they can take the cards of this
whole<00:02:41.880> on<00:02:42.030> to<00:02:42.180> them<00:02:42.300> and<00:02:42.480> the<00:02:43.380> sky<00:02:43.680> is<00:02:43.740> the

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 
whole on to them and the sky is the

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:45.230 
whole on to them and the sky is the
limits<00:02:44.220> from<00:02:44.280> here<00:02:44.490> you<00:02:44.610> can<00:02:44.640> reveal<00:02:45.060> their

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:45.240 
limits from here you can reveal their

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:46.730 
limits from here you can reveal their
card<00:02:45.480> any<00:02:45.690> way<00:02:45.840> you<00:02:45.870> want<00:02:46.110> you<00:02:46.200> could<00:02:46.320> draw<00:02:46.560> it

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:46.740 
card any way you want you could draw it

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:48.560 
card any way you want you could draw it
on<00:02:46.800> the<00:02:46.950> notepad<00:02:47.130> you<00:02:47.910> can<00:02:48.030> just<00:02:48.150> tell<00:02:48.330> it<00:02:48.450> to

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:48.570 
on the notepad you can just tell it to

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:51.800 
on the notepad you can just tell it to
them<00:02:48.720> mentally<00:02:49.440> or<00:02:49.980> you<00:02:50.580> can<00:02:50.730> kind<00:02:50.940> of<00:02:51.030> have

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
them mentally or you can kind of have

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:53.780 
them mentally or you can kind of have
everybody<00:02:52.410> draw<00:02:52.830> and<00:02:53.040> focus<00:02:53.400> on<00:02:53.550> something

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
everybody draw and focus on something

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:55.700 
everybody draw and focus on something
like<00:02:54.510> I<00:02:54.600> said<00:02:54.780> the<00:02:54.870> sky's<00:02:55.110> the<00:02:55.140> limit<00:02:55.320> but

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:55.710 
like I said the sky's the limit but

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:58.400 
like I said the sky's the limit but
that's<00:02:55.860> calling<00:02:56.520> on<00:02:56.700> a<00:02:56.760> spread<00:02:57.630> so<00:02:57.870> after<00:02:58.320> you

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:58.410 
that's calling on a spread so after you

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:00.260 
that's calling on a spread so after you
spread<00:02:58.620> you<00:02:59.130> want<00:02:59.310> to<00:02:59.370> call<00:02:59.550> the<00:02:59.700> bottom<00:03:00.000> card

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:00.270 
spread you want to call the bottom card

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:02.240 
spread you want to call the bottom card
underneath<00:03:01.200> so<00:03:01.530> they<00:03:01.710> can't<00:03:01.920> see<00:03:01.980> what's

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
underneath so they can't see what's

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:11.190 
underneath so they can't see what's
happening

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:11.200 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:13.260 

you
