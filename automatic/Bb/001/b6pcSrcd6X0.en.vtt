neutral<00:00:30.449> looks<00:00:30.630> to<00:00:30.810> school<00:00:31.109> so<00:00:31.500> this<00:00:32.040> is<00:00:32.160> kind

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
neutral looks to school so this is kind

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.370 
neutral looks to school so this is kind
of<00:00:32.460> a<00:00:32.550> peach<00:00:32.820> shadow<00:00:33.420> and<00:00:33.840> then<00:00:33.960> a<00:00:33.989> really

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
of a peach shadow and then a really

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.740 
of a peach shadow and then a really
thick<00:00:34.800> black<00:00:35.190> gel<00:00:35.640> liner<00:00:35.670> with<00:00:36.239> it<00:00:36.390> and<00:00:36.540> the

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
thick black gel liner with it and the

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:37.850 
thick black gel liner with it and the
look<00:00:36.899> is<00:00:37.020> all<00:00:37.200> matte<00:00:37.440> so<00:00:37.620> it's<00:00:37.710> not<00:00:37.800> really

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
look is all matte so it's not really

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.069 
look is all matte so it's not really
frosty<00:00:38.550> or<00:00:38.700> shimmery<00:00:39.030> or<00:00:39.120> glittery<00:00:39.239> or<00:00:39.750> any<00:00:39.930> of

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
frosty or shimmery or glittery or any of

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.530 
frosty or shimmery or glittery or any of
that<00:00:40.370> so<00:00:41.370> it<00:00:41.489> makes<00:00:41.640> it<00:00:41.760> a<00:00:41.879> little<00:00:42.030> more<00:00:42.149> school

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
that so it makes it a little more school

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.479 
that so it makes it a little more school
appropriate<00:00:42.930> but<00:00:43.260> it<00:00:43.290> definitely<00:00:43.530> stands<00:00:44.340> out

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
appropriate but it definitely stands out

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.430 
appropriate but it definitely stands out
a<00:00:44.550> little<00:00:44.730> bit<00:00:44.969> with<00:00:45.180> the<00:00:45.450> black<00:00:45.690> liner<00:00:46.110> and

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
a little bit with the black liner and

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.529 
a little bit with the black liner and
the<00:00:46.500> hint<00:00:47.280> of<00:00:47.399> peach<00:00:47.610> to<00:00:47.850> the<00:00:47.940> eyes<00:00:48.059> i<00:00:48.239> think<00:00:48.420> is

the hint of peach to the eyes i think is

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.479 
the hint of peach to the eyes i think is
really<00:00:48.870> flattering<00:00:49.170> on<00:00:49.500> any<00:00:49.710> eye<00:00:49.829> color<00:00:50.219> and
