00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
want a regular sized magnet it would be

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.550 
want a regular sized magnet it would be
about<00:01:13.710> 750<00:01:14.400> and<00:01:14.729> if<00:01:15.000> you<00:01:15.090> look<00:01:15.240> at<00:01:15.360> this

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:18.560 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:21.289 

Magnezone<00:01:19.560> it's<00:01:20.369> a<00:01:20.490> little<00:01:20.700> bit<00:01:20.820> bigger<00:01:21.000> it's

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
Magnezone it's a little bit bigger it's

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:22.999 
Magnezone it's a little bit bigger it's
like<00:01:21.450> kind<00:01:21.689> of<00:01:21.750> double<00:01:22.049> the<00:01:22.170> size<00:01:22.320> of<00:01:22.619> them<00:01:22.799> you

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
like kind of double the size of them you

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.370 
like kind of double the size of them you
maybe<00:01:23.250> if<00:01:23.460> you<00:01:23.549> look<00:01:23.729> at<00:01:23.880> it<00:01:23.909> there<00:01:24.200> so<00:01:25.200> take

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
maybe if you look at it there so take

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.140 
maybe if you look at it there so take
some<00:01:25.409> more<00:01:25.619> time<00:01:25.680> and<00:01:26.070> more<00:01:26.630> supplies<00:01:27.630> more

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:29.150 
some more time and more supplies more

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:31.580 
some more time and more supplies more
thread<00:01:30.150> so<00:01:30.750> those<00:01:30.930> would<00:01:31.110> probably<00:01:31.170> like<00:01:31.530> a

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
thread so those would probably like a

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.499 
thread so those would probably like a
dollar<00:01:31.829> more<00:01:32.130> but<00:01:32.790> um<00:01:32.970> just<00:01:33.180> to<00:01:33.240> give<00:01:33.360> you<00:01:33.420> guys

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
dollar more but um just to give you guys

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:34.670 
dollar more but um just to give you guys
a<00:01:33.570> quick<00:01:33.720> little<00:01:33.869> reference<00:01:34.079> there's<00:01:34.500> that
