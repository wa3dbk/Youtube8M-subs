00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:37.420
 Yes 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:48.519
 sÃ¶lden as such as formerly an area 

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:52.780
 is only relatively little known offers 

00:00:48.519 --> 00:00:55.690
 but many very good departures 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:01:00.089
 particularly in high alpine area so 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:03.089
 especially for good before offers oil 

00:01:00.089 --> 00:01:06.360
 countless really many spectacular 

00:01:03.089 --> 00:01:09.549
 to make sacrifice and west 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.380
 due to the topography of the terrain 

00:01:09.549 --> 00:01:14.100
 that also roll very high alpinist 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:16.899
 partially anno in the upper area 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:19.990
 Vergletschert offers is then too 

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:22.270
 Extremely long runs on the part 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:23.110
 with up to 2000 films of the departure 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:27.280
 can handle 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:30.450
 not great for a long time now 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:30.450
 to have to go up 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:42.360
 if you really intend to go into the now 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:44.299
 You have to go to the grounds for freeriding 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:47.820
 of course very nice and smart 

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:50.240
 where the appropriate freeride areas 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:53.340
 are the corresponding departures in 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:54.930
 Normally, relatively the same as when 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.850
 normal skiers on the runway what 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:02:00.420
 There are blue red and black runs there 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:02.850
 it freeriden certain categories of 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:05.040
 easy to extreme downhills and 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:07.940
 I have to stop there itself well 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:10.380
 assess her from traveling to 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:11.690
 from the conditional and technical 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:13.550
 conditions 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:15.420
 Orienteering and 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:16.920
 accordingly search once the departure 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:18.650
 from so what ever comes to me in 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:22.980
 question 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:25.319
 Furthermore, of course, need the 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:27.780
 Emergency equipment that is always there 

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:30.870
 and the emergency equipment is there 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:32.220
 from a backpack shovel probe and 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:36.840
 an avalanche beeper is the 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:40.019
 basic equipment of any free rider in 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:42.600
 Help should be the only one 

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:45.950
 really effective help is if mine 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:48.660
 friends with me immediately with the lvs 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:51.329
 locate and thus already special and 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:53.760
 Shovel quickly out of faith and fast 

00:02:51.329 --> 00:02:55.950
 hest if possible in the first ten 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:58.579
 minutes after the accident occurs 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:01.320
 chances of survival are still greatest 

00:02:58.579 --> 00:03:03.030
 but I can also do it very urgently 

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:03.480
 recommend going to the terrain too 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:08.250
 go 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:10.470
 let you train makes its course where 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:13.260
 He also showed the necessary know-how 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:14.820
 gets built up systematically 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.590
 war then she has a lot more fun and 

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:18.090
 on the way when he does 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:20.540
 go on tour independently 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:20.540
 will 

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:31.520
 emi is the mountain in winter the mountains in 

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:35.620
 winter that the tenant snow cover as well 

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:39.110
 a large white sheet untouched 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:40.610
 snow cover and where then everyone 

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:45.950
 can be corresponding 

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:48.170
 his personal style is personal 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:50.510
 show the rain alone 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:54.740
 can set the game rules 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:57.320
 certain mountain experience and that 

00:03:54.740 --> 00:04:00.740
 own can and accordingly it is 

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:02.330
 cause you like where you stop here 

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:05.780
 to learn which he is constantly interesting 

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:08.200
 stay well every winter is different if 

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:10.520
 you have to be new again and again 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:13.220
 concentrate and open your eyes 

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:14.810
 sharpen all senses and as far as it goes 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:17.980
 I'm bored with everyone 

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:17.980
 day on the mountain is on the way 

00:04:32.749 --> 00:04:38.270
