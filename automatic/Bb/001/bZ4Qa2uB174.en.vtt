00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:16.760 
work that they do in a daily basis and

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:19.640 
work that they do in a daily basis and
we're<00:00:17.760> producing<00:00:18.180> many<00:00:18.990> good<00:00:19.230> footballers

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
we're producing many good footballers

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.769 
we're producing many good footballers
but<00:00:19.830> today<00:00:20.100> I<00:00:20.130> think<00:00:20.430> it<00:00:20.550> was<00:00:20.640> very<00:00:21.449> clear<00:00:21.750> that

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
but today I think it was very clear that

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:26.060 
but today I think it was very clear that
we<00:00:22.650> need<00:00:22.680> to<00:00:23.130> get<00:00:23.279> that<00:00:23.340> sort<00:00:23.880> of<00:00:25.070> experience

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
we need to get that sort of experience

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.910 
we need to get that sort of experience
in<00:00:26.250> league<00:00:27.150> football<00:00:27.599> that<00:00:27.930> he<00:00:27.990> makes<00:00:28.260> a<00:00:28.470> big

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
in league football that he makes a big

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.189 
in league football that he makes a big
difference<00:00:29.310> in<00:00:29.640> school<00:00:30.449> lines<00:00:30.689> I<00:00:30.900> thought<00:00:31.109> it

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
difference in school lines I thought it

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.200 
difference in school lines I thought it
was<00:00:31.320> a<00:00:31.349> really<00:00:31.439> good<00:00:32.309> game<00:00:32.340> in<00:00:32.640> that<00:00:32.730> respect<00:00:33.090> a

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
was a really good game in that respect a

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.080 
was a really good game in that respect a

today<00:01:13.830> was<00:01:14.070> important<00:01:14.490> for<00:01:14.520> us<00:01:14.670> to<00:01:14.729> see

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
today was important for us to see

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.570 
today was important for us to see
whether<00:01:15.180> younger<00:01:15.540> players<00:01:15.810> we're<00:01:16.590> in<00:01:17.280> order

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
whether younger players we're in order

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.010 
whether younger players we're in order
to<00:01:17.729> see<00:01:18.119> if<00:01:18.180> they're<00:01:18.360> ready<00:01:18.390> for<00:01:18.600> the<00:01:18.810> first

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
to see if they're ready for the first

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.050 
to see if they're ready for the first
game<00:01:19.229> and<00:01:19.470> I<00:01:19.680> just<00:01:20.340> feel<00:01:20.490> that<00:01:20.729> it's<00:01:20.909> going<00:01:21.000> to

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
game and I just feel that it's going to

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.850 
game and I just feel that it's going to
be<00:01:21.180> very<00:01:21.390> very<00:01:21.720> difficult<00:01:22.049> to<00:01:22.380> allow<00:01:22.650> the

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
be very very difficult to allow the

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.289 
be very very difficult to allow the
young<00:01:23.040> players<00:01:23.340> to<00:01:23.430> develop<00:01:24.030> and<00:01:24.210> grow

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
young players to develop and grow

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.480 
young players to develop and grow
without<00:01:24.659> having<00:01:25.080> the<00:01:25.619> opportunity<00:01:25.799> of<00:01:26.220> going

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
without having the opportunity of going

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.429 
without having the opportunity of going
out<00:01:26.700> on<00:01:26.850> loan<00:01:26.880> and<00:01:27.210> emergency<00:01:27.720> loans<00:01:27.900> after<00:01:28.110> a

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
out on loan and emergency loans after a

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:31.520 
out on loan and emergency loans after a
season<00:01:28.770> so<00:01:29.070> I<00:01:29.130> think<00:01:29.189> today<00:01:29.549> if<00:01:30.180> anything<00:01:30.540> we

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
season so I think today if anything we

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:32.630 
season so I think today if anything we
saw<00:01:31.680> that<00:01:31.799> we<00:01:31.890> need<00:01:32.009> to<00:01:32.040> put<00:01:32.250> something<00:01:32.430> in

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
saw that we need to put something in

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.850 
saw that we need to put something in
place<00:01:32.670> to<00:01:33.090> develop<00:01:33.659> our<00:01:34.020> young<00:01:34.259> players<00:01:34.439> and

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860
