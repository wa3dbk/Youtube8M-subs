00:06:00.789 --> 00:06:01.740 
you think they'll come back I think they
have<00:06:00.940> to<00:06:01.090> come<00:06:01.270> back

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:01.750 
have to come back

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:03.719 
have to come back
I<00:06:01.780> think<00:06:02.349> things<00:06:02.680> do<00:06:02.919> go<00:06:03.130> into<00:06:03.340> wings<00:06:03.580> are

00:06:03.729 --> 00:06:07.709 
I think things do go into wings are
roundabouts<00:06:04.210> and<00:06:04.539> I<00:06:05.500> think<00:06:06.250> that<00:06:06.659> there's<00:06:07.659> a

00:06:07.709 --> 00:06:07.719 
roundabouts and I think that there's a

00:06:07.719 --> 00:06:09.899 
roundabouts and I think that there's a

00:06:09.899 --> 00:06:09.909 
huge amount of fear in the upper

00:06:09.909 --> 00:06:11.100 
huge amount of fear in the upper
