00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.929 
but uh yeah let's get into it so the way
to<00:01:03.690> craft<00:01:04.019> these<00:01:04.199> is<00:01:04.439> pretty<00:01:05.220> much<00:01:05.369> everything

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
to craft these is pretty much everything

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.300 
to craft these is pretty much everything
it<00:01:06.150> resolves<00:01:06.720> around<00:01:06.780> a<00:01:07.409> new<00:01:07.680> oil<00:01:07.950> that's

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310

you<00:01:54.299> jet<00:01:54.659> turbine<00:01:55.049> then<00:01:55.259> you<00:01:55.320> need<00:01:55.439> two<00:01:55.680> of

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
you jet turbine then you need two of

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.420 
you jet turbine then you need two of
them<00:01:56.270> then<00:01:57.270> if<00:01:57.420> i<00:01:57.509> press<00:01:57.869> you<00:01:58.259> on<00:01:58.290> that<00:01:58.680> succeed

them then if i press you on that succeed

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:02.149 
them then if i press you on that succeed
back<00:01:59.729> to<00:01:59.909> recipe<00:02:00.270> so<00:02:00.899> transform<00:02:01.770> your<00:02:01.829> feet

Energon<00:03:32.489> crystal<00:03:33.030> piece<00:03:33.269> i<00:03:33.299> think<00:03:33.750> that's

00:03:34.189 --> 00:03:34.199 
Energon crystal piece i think that's

00:03:34.199 --> 00:03:36.770 
Energon crystal piece i think that's
part<00:03:34.859> of<00:03:34.949> the<00:03:35.069> craft<00:03:35.340> recipe<00:03:35.760> let<00:03:36.299> me<00:03:36.449> defend

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:36.780 
part of the craft recipe let me defend

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:38.869 
part of the craft recipe let me defend
them<00:03:37.079> I<00:03:37.319> think<00:03:37.620> it<00:03:37.709> just<00:03:37.859> miss<00:03:38.129> out<00:03:38.310> and<00:03:38.609> tank

00:03:38.869 --> 00:03:38.879 
them I think it just miss out and tank

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:40.610 
them I think it just miss out and tank
shell<00:03:39.150> think<00:03:39.359> chels<00:03:39.599> obvious<00:03:39.959> with<00:03:40.139> tank<00:03:40.439> a

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:40.620 
shell think chels obvious with tank a

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:42.890 
shell think chels obvious with tank a
missile<00:03:41.189> must<00:03:41.489> be<00:03:41.669> firm<00:03:42.000> you<00:03:42.269> know<00:03:42.389> the<00:03:42.599> Jets
