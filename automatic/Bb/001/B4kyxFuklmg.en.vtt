00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:06.420
 many negative gains because the name of the 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.620
 video flames detox to lose weight 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:09.630
 I came here to tell people that the 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:14.179
 Touch juice is not enough to lose weight 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:14.179
 not for weight loss 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:20.460

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:33.240
 The term spoke cross and went crazy here. 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.130

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.259

 when there because it's hard to see how I 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:55.490
 I'm not exaggerating when doing a search 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:02:00.340
 Quick here on google so let's dictate 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:04.240
 that touch-touch juice recipe 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:06.440

 They talk to us and make us hear if we 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:12.920
 It took juice of touches to see which 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:14.990

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:36.080
