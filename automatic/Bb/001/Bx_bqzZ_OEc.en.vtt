high it's not if he gets traded or moved

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.319 
high it's not if he gets traded or moved
it's<00:00:49.440> when<00:00:49.800> we<00:00:50.460> know<00:00:50.610> he's<00:00:50.789> on<00:00:50.940> a<00:00:50.969> short-term

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
it's when we know he's on a short-term

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.270 
it's when we know he's on a short-term
leash<00:00:51.809> here<00:00:52.110> because<00:00:52.469> of<00:00:52.620> the<00:00:52.860> long<00:00:53.070> go

contract<00:00:53.789> in<00:00:53.940> the<00:00:54.059> commitment<00:00:54.510> to<00:00:54.600> there<00:00:54.780> I

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
contract in the commitment to there I

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.260 
contract in the commitment to there I
still<00:00:55.469> think<00:00:55.530> that<00:00:55.980> the<00:00:56.370> deal<00:00:56.610> that<00:00:56.640> out<00:00:57.000> there

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
still think that the deal that out there

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.990 
still think that the deal that out there
is<00:00:57.390> to<00:00:57.539> be<00:00:57.660> made<00:00:58.129> would<00:00:59.129> be<00:00:59.190> with<00:00:59.520> the<00:00:59.640> Tampa

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
is to be made would be with the Tampa

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.150 
is to be made would be with the Tampa
Bay<00:01:00.030> Lightning<00:01:00.180> they<00:01:00.780> want<00:01:01.050> him<00:01:01.260> real<00:01:01.590> bad<00:01:01.890> but

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
Bay Lightning they want him real bad but

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.910 
Bay Lightning they want him real bad but
the<00:01:02.280> question<00:01:02.699> is<00:01:02.879> with<00:01:03.420> Gillis<00:01:03.840> what<00:01:04.530> do<00:01:04.710> they

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
the question is with Gillis what do they

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.880 
the question is with Gillis what do they
have<00:01:05.189> that<00:01:05.519> could<00:01:06.270> really<00:01:06.570> give<00:01:07.170> Vancouver

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
have that could really give Vancouver

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.500 
have that could really give Vancouver
shot<00:01:08.159> in<00:01:08.280> the<00:01:08.369> arm<00:01:08.520> if<00:01:08.700> you<00:01:08.729> ask<00:01:08.939> me<00:01:09.180> to<00:01:09.330> deal

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
shot in the arm if you ask me to deal

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.330 
shot in the arm if you ask me to deal
with<00:01:09.720> that<00:01:09.960> that<00:01:10.229> should<00:01:10.650> be<00:01:10.799> out<00:01:10.920> there<00:01:11.130> right

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
with that that should be out there right

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.149 
with that that should be out there right
now<00:01:11.369> is<00:01:11.760> a<00:01:12.119> first-round<00:01:12.689> pick<00:01:12.840> and<00:01:13.320> Ryan

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
now is a first-round pick and Ryan

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.580 
now is a first-round pick and Ryan
Malone<00:01:14.939> that<00:01:15.479> would<00:01:15.720> be<00:01:15.869> the<00:01:15.990> type<00:01:16.200> of<00:01:16.380> deal

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
Malone that would be the type of deal

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.800 
Malone that would be the type of deal
that<00:01:17.130> I<00:01:17.159> think<00:01:17.430> Gillis<00:01:17.759> has<00:01:17.939> no<00:01:18.210> problem

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
that I think Gillis has no problem

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.010 
that I think Gillis has no problem
looking<00:01:18.960> at<00:01:19.320> the<00:01:19.979> question<00:01:20.460> is<00:01:20.900> can<00:01:21.900> you

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
looking at the question is can you

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.109 
looking at the question is can you
convince<00:01:22.290> Malone<00:01:22.740> that<00:01:23.369> he<00:01:23.729> should<00:01:23.909> come<00:01:24.060> to

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
convince Malone that he should come to

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.060 
convince Malone that he should come to
Vancouver<00:01:24.360> he's<00:01:24.840> got<00:01:24.990> a<00:01:25.020> no<00:01:25.229> move<00:01:25.439> clause<00:01:25.740> and

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
Vancouver he's got a no move clause and

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:27.859 
Vancouver he's got a no move clause and
I<00:01:26.490> think<00:01:26.670> that<00:01:26.820> would<00:01:27.000> go<00:01:27.119> a<00:01:27.150> long<00:01:27.360> ways<00:01:27.630> to

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
I think that would go a long ways to

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:29.630 
I think that would go a long ways to
making<00:01:28.170> the<00:01:28.259> deal<00:01:28.439> of<00:01:28.619> that<00:01:28.740> magnitude<00:01:29.340> but

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
making the deal of that magnitude but

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.090 
making the deal of that magnitude but
then<00:01:30.450> I'd<00:01:30.630> have<00:01:30.689> to<00:01:30.810> be<00:01:31.020> a<00:01:31.049> cap<00:01:31.320> space<00:01:31.560> issue<00:01:31.799> to

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
then I'd have to be a cap space issue to

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.530 
then I'd have to be a cap space issue to
Nick<00:01:32.280> let's<00:01:32.520> face<00:01:32.670> it<00:01:32.700> Malone's<00:01:33.090> a<00:01:33.210> big-ticket

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
perfect fit for the Vancouver Canucks a

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:10.760 
perfect fit for the Vancouver Canucks a
top<00:02:09.239> six<00:02:09.569> for<00:02:09.810> Westwood<00:02:10.200> it<00:02:10.379> could<00:02:10.530> make<00:02:10.739> a

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
top six for Westwood it could make a

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.979 
top six for Westwood it could make a
difference<00:02:11.280> for<00:02:11.910> the<00:02:12.090> playoff<00:02:12.360> run<00:02:12.540> this<00:02:12.780> year

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:13.710 
difference for the playoff run this year
and<00:02:13.170> I<00:02:13.230> don't<00:02:13.290> think

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
and I don't think

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:16.020 
and I don't think
he<00:02:14.110> wants<00:02:14.410> a<00:02:14.440> first<00:02:14.710> round<00:02:14.920> pick<00:02:15.100> in<00:02:15.130> a<00:02:15.280> top<00:02:15.550> six

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.030 
he wants a first round pick in a top six

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:17.640 
he wants a first round pick in a top six
and<00:02:16.390> yeah<00:02:16.570> that's<00:02:16.720> the<00:02:16.840> type<00:02:17.050> of<00:02:17.080> deal<00:02:17.410> that<00:02:17.620> I

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.650 
and yeah that's the type of deal that I

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:20.190 
and yeah that's the type of deal that I
mentioned<00:02:18.190> with<00:02:19.120> Tampa<00:02:19.540> Bay<00:02:19.690> that<00:02:19.930> it<00:02:20.050> would

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
mentioned with Tampa Bay that it would

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.230 
mentioned with Tampa Bay that it would
take<00:02:20.440> for<00:02:21.160> Gillis<00:02:21.430> to<00:02:21.520> move<00:02:21.670> on<00:02:21.790> the<00:02:22.090> other

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:22.240 
take for Gillis to move on the other

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:23.970 
take for Gillis to move on the other
thing<00:02:22.510> is<00:02:22.630> don't<00:02:22.840> forget<00:02:23.110> what's<00:02:23.380> the<00:02:23.590> market

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
thing is don't forget what's the market

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:25.890 
thing is don't forget what's the market
other<00:02:24.130> than<00:02:24.400> Tampa<00:02:24.820> for<00:02:25.060> a<00:02:25.090> goaltender<00:02:25.720> and

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:25.900 
other than Tampa for a goaltender and

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:28.020 
other than Tampa for a goaltender and
that<00:02:26.020> would<00:02:26.290> be<00:02:26.470> not<00:02:27.040> very<00:02:27.280> much<00:02:27.430> when<00:02:27.940> you

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.030 
that would be not very much when you

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:29.520 
that would be not very much when you
consider<00:02:28.360> there's<00:02:28.630> another<00:02:28.840> backup<00:02:29.140> goalie

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.530 
consider there's another backup goalie

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:31.500 
consider there's another backup goalie

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:33.610 
Bernier in Los Angeles that could be in

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:36.330 
Bernier in Los Angeles that could be in
bigger<00:02:33.880> demand<00:02:34.710> here's<00:02:35.710> one<00:02:35.980> other<00:02:36.130> aspect

bigger demand here's one other aspect

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.430 
bigger demand here's one other aspect
that<00:02:36.760> Gillis<00:02:37.090> has<00:02:37.240> to<00:02:37.390> worry<00:02:37.600> about<00:02:37.750> too<00:02:38.170> that

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.440 
that Gillis has to worry about too that
