people that's right and you want to know
why<00:01:08.310> it's<00:01:08.490> working<00:01:10.340> that's<00:01:11.340> right<00:01:11.549> it's

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
why it's working that's right it's

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.609 
why it's working that's right it's
because<00:01:12.510> of<00:01:12.750> this<00:01:13.229> candle<00:01:14.780> that's<00:01:15.780> right<00:01:16.080> it's

because of this candle that's right it's

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:21.469 
because of this candle that's right it's
because<00:01:17.040> of<00:01:17.310> a<00:01:17.520> candle<00:01:18.180> it's<00:01:18.450> working<00:01:20.479> somehow

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
because of a candle it's working somehow

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:25.390 
because of a candle it's working somehow
I<00:01:21.810> don't<00:01:22.439> quite<00:01:22.770> understand<00:01:23.280> it<00:01:23.369> myself

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:25.400 
I don't quite understand it myself

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:29.539 
I don't quite understand it myself
somehow<00:01:26.400> the<00:01:27.270> camera<00:01:27.810> in<00:01:27.990> the<00:01:28.680> and<00:01:28.979> each<00:01:29.340> we

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
somehow the camera in the and each we

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:33.530 
somehow the camera in the and each we
remote<00:01:29.880> can<00:01:30.689> detect<00:01:31.820> heat<00:01:32.820> or<00:01:33.119> something

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
remote can detect heat or something

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.330 
remote can detect heat or something
something<00:01:33.990> in<00:01:34.079> that<00:01:34.110> candle<00:01:34.650> makes<00:01:34.950> it<00:01:35.130> work

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
something in that candle makes it work

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.880 
something in that candle makes it work
just<00:01:36.210> let<00:01:36.390> the<00:01:36.540> sensor<00:01:36.869> bar<00:01:37.079> usually<00:01:37.380> works<00:01:37.710> on

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
just let the sensor bar usually works on

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.810 
just let the sensor bar usually works on
top<00:01:38.100> of<00:01:38.220> the<00:01:38.280> TV<00:01:38.310> it's<00:01:38.820> the<00:01:38.970> exact<00:01:39.240> same<00:01:39.270> thing

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:40.820 
top of the TV it's the exact same thing

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:45.020 
top of the TV it's the exact same thing
so<00:01:42.530> this<00:01:43.530> is<00:01:43.560> what<00:01:43.829> happens<00:01:43.860> when<00:01:44.399> you<00:01:44.880> have<00:01:45.000> a

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
so this is what happens when you have a

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.760 
so this is what happens when you have a
candle<00:01:45.450> in<00:01:45.509> front<00:01:45.570> on<00:01:46.049> the<00:01:46.170> bottom<00:01:46.409> of<00:01:46.500> your<00:01:46.530> TV

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
candle in front on the bottom of your TV

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.780 
candle in front on the bottom of your TV
or<00:01:47.759> on<00:01:48.000> top<00:01:48.149> of<00:01:48.390> your<00:01:48.509> TV<00:01:48.689> but<00:01:48.960> in<00:01:49.049> this<00:01:49.110> case

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:49.790 
or on top of your TV but in this case

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:54.590 
or on top of your TV but in this case
that<00:01:50.790> would<00:01:51.409> not<00:01:52.409> work<00:01:52.439> on<00:01:53.130> top<00:01:53.970> of<00:01:54.060> the<00:01:54.119> TV<00:01:54.270> now

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
that would not work on top of the TV now

00:01:54.600 --> 00:02:02.550 
that would not work on top of the TV now
it<00:01:54.780> would<00:01:54.899> work<00:01:57.710> and<00:01:58.710> so<00:01:58.950> yeah<00:02:00.079> there<00:02:01.079> you<00:02:01.229> go

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:02.560 
it would work and so yeah there you go

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:06.660 
it would work and so yeah there you go
that's<00:02:03.560> a<00:02:03.890> pretty<00:02:04.700> interesting<00:02:04.940> isn't<00:02:05.390> it<00:02:05.540> and

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:06.670 
that's a pretty interesting isn't it and

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:11.590 
that's a pretty interesting isn't it and
if<00:02:07.670> you<00:02:07.820> don't<00:02:08.060> believe<00:02:08.360> me<00:02:10.420> watch<00:02:11.420> what

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:11.600 
if you don't believe me watch what

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:14.500 
if you don't believe me watch what
happens<00:02:12.190> when<00:02:13.190> I<00:02:13.220> put<00:02:13.520> when<00:02:14.000> I<00:02:14.030> take<00:02:14.300> the
