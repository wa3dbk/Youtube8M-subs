00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.970
 Szabolcs VSC rimo mix and this 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:06.839
 combat agreed to eight rounds of three 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:08.730
 minutes 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:11.690
 the current Spanish weight champion 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:15.309
 superwelter pablo navascués 

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:15.309
 pupils more Emilio than me 

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:19.689
 maturing in addition to that punch that 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:21.070
 he always had because he 's a passer 

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:23.800
 that little by little we are seeing it a lot 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:30.119
 more done much more professional with 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:30.119
 much more plant and is learning 

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:37.129
 amateur but good matches apart from his 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:39.769
 hitting powerful as it is improving without 

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:41.770
 doubt the quadrilateral there is this bag 

00:00:39.769 --> 00:00:46.780
 and remote ski inmate 

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:48.879
 with that record of 43 according to 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:52.140
 others to other data masses that never 

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:52.140
 they are 10 4 1 

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:58.219
 of 43 110 31 being those then there are 

00:00:56.719 --> 00:00:59.980
 a series of combats that some the 

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:01.540
 they recognize and others do not 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:04.210
 and now we hear the presentation of 

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:06.430
 Pablo Navascués this humble Spanish from 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:08.020
 29 years 19 victories just one 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:10.210
 defeat of the office of victories 14 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:12.220
 achieved before a champion limit of 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:15.760
 Spain of the superwelter to defeat 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:17.140
 jaume pons that technical decision in five 

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:19.330
 assaults in that fight in which it was cut 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:22.630
 pons that was the cards and Pablo won 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:24.729
 Navascués has him in this one and that as 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:26.380
 we say lately mention andré and pe 

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:28.300
 star because he finished the room 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:30.280
 assault to according to the champion of europe well 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:32.229
 True it saw better tell me about 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:34.690
 we saw it was practically a shadow 

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:36.270
 of student was but it is what it is 

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:38.009
 true is that he is a boxer 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.810
 we have seen evolve in a way 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:42.450
 very very fast or very well paying more 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:44.490
 well in addition to that forceful punch 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.679
 that has always had eggs and 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:50.039
 logically with that punch that has more 

00:01:46.679 --> 00:01:52.170
 then he is covering his technique we do 

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:54.150
 the number one 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.270
 the first assault 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:58.830
 the only defeat of problems put to 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:00.660
 defeat in the year 2000 before kicks and 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:02.910
 with billy here shifts one is high that 

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:05.160
 We can properly consider it as a 

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:07.110
 accident or entrusted to the tail 

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:09.330
 It has totally surpassed the Georgian 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.679
 he is a boxer who was fighting 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.689
 habitually 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:15.210
 of getting a victory and surprised 

00:02:12.689 --> 00:02:16.950
 those who got a magnificent 

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:18.780
 and the fight is over but since then 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:20.850
 he has won eleven more victories 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:22.080
 navascués one of them we knew that 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:23.940
 has been used to proclaim himself champion of 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:26.370
 spain super welterweight and here you 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:29.220
 they have another combat before this 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:30.390
 bag east ski rhythm that is also 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.860
 in england in the last two 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:34.170
 combats for all points with alan 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:35.670
 johnson boxer a milkshake the super 4 in 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:37.080
 the third before richard williams also 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:39.690
 an English 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:41.280
 antia min so cain in in finland that 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:42.930
 we have a know the shake you from 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:44.760
 these the Hungarian assets that he has 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:46.080
 go to the rival's house and when facing 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.640
 then to the vocal stars to the 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:49.800
 fighters unbeaten to the promises of 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:51.240
 Prospects sometimes ask before 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:52.850
 of the limit do not be afraid comments of alan 

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:55.620
 joyce that it is possible to stand 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:57.730
 the six rounds to which he was 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:01.390
 programmed the combat 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:05.180
 and there we see a Pablo Navascués 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:06.980
 and in a centered with the 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:09.310
 working with the left and dodging 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:11.170
 your own auzqui rhythm 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:13.180
 we saw that pablo navascués in a search engine 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:16.000
 that was based earlier is boxing 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:18.489
 in his punch and little more but little by little 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.250
 well, we carry many more resources 

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:24.010
 boxer good because there we already are 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:26.980
 checking with him already see left and 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:28.420
 penetrating we have also seen him in a 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:31.069
 couple of times taking an uppercut 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:35.200
 those inside blows needed 

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:35.200
 in boxing to go forcing your rival 

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:41.959
 in other ultimate matches we have seen 

00:03:38.379 --> 00:03:45.270
 with excess weight some more thing and it 

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:46.920
 he sees more stuck 

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:48.960
 at other times , working very 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:54.170
 well with the left the madrileño 

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:56.569
 quiet combat eight rounds 

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:58.930
 boxing very well with that live 

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:58.930
 left 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:02.189
 doing this 

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:17.040
 try rhythms that never 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:19.560
 those blows to one more can be removed 

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:22.810
 third of march well above the 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:24.430
 somewhat slow problems in catching Hungarian 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:26.050
 and at this time the middle distance is 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:27.730
 dominating Pablo Navascués who has come 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:30.930
 taken out again the uppercut throws him the 

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:30.930
 direct from right 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:37.090
 and that if not working and studying their 

00:04:35.229 --> 00:04:39.250
 rivals and progressing 

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:41.530
 technically pablo navascués for the 

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:43.060
 combats that were coming so far 

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:45.819
 he is already champion of spain but good one 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:47.759
 of the many fights committed if 

00:04:45.819 --> 00:04:50.080
 you want to continue at this professional level 

00:04:47.759 --> 00:04:52.629
 in rigid waist that has 

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:54.220
 still that move more that waist more 

00:04:52.629 --> 00:04:56.259
 that head to dodge had dodged 

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:58.530
 well that left crochet the rhythm 

00:04:56.259 --> 00:04:58.530
 ski 

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:03.680
 in that maturation process 

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:10.169
 a tremendous right by Pablo Navascués 

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:12.930
 he took the fight and the rich gentleman 

00:05:10.169 --> 00:05:15.210
 is counting by obligation but let's 

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:17.069
 there it is impossible for the 

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:19.439
 Hungarian rhythm elusive and right 

00:05:17.069 --> 00:05:21.990
 it was also when Pablo was entering 

00:05:19.439 --> 00:05:23.129
 navascúes knew how to take advantage of that input from 

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:26.490
 rhythms and to put a right 

00:05:23.129 --> 00:05:27.870
 tremendous with effect we go fulminant 

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:29.729
 as you could see, right 

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:31.439
 precious also I name that sticks 

00:05:29.729 --> 00:05:32.520
 very strong in addition to the counter that does 

00:05:31.439 --> 00:05:34.110
 more damage when the 

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:36.569
 Hungarian has been a precious blow is 

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:38.009
 unique and man is it true that I was pissed 

00:05:36.569 --> 00:05:39.599
 Well, at least I was working, 

00:05:38.009 --> 00:05:43.169
 it seems that I would have come here since there is no 

00:05:39.599 --> 00:05:44.999
 variants of right but it falls 

00:05:43.169 --> 00:05:46.199
 we will have the opportunity to see it repeated 

00:05:44.999 --> 00:05:48.719
 but it has been tremendous the 

00:05:46.199 --> 00:05:50.129
 right hand of Pablo Navascués who 

00:05:48.719 --> 00:05:51.539
 get one more victory before 

00:05:50.129 --> 00:05:54.620
 limit a line in the first round 

00:05:51.539 --> 00:05:54.620
 also spectacularly 

00:05:56.580 --> 00:06:01.710
 victory the truth is that there is how 

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:03.720
 he was willing to throw his right 

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:06.659
 rhythms that already and they put him right premium 

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:09.449
 of contracts within Pablo Navascués a 

00:06:06.659 --> 00:06:12.660
 final blow demolishing 

00:06:09.449 --> 00:06:14.880
 dodging the right also from 

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:17.560
 tremendous tremendous is the movement of 

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:19.840
 Pablo Navascués 

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:21.669
 here we are looking forward to having 

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:23.970
 to continue fighting that not clear of that 

00:06:21.669 --> 00:06:26.230
 that the legs said the extremities 

00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:27.800
 therefore victory because the first 

00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:31.810
 assault 

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:31.810
 for the hurricane for Pablo Navascués 

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:36.419
 good of spain of the superwelter weight that 

00:06:35.219 --> 00:06:38.509
 get one more victory before 

00:06:36.419 --> 00:06:38.509
 limit
