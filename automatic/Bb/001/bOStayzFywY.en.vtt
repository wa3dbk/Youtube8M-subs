out<00:01:36.570> nidoking<00:01:37.259> because<00:01:37.619> he<00:01:37.829> has<00:01:38.009> then<00:01:38.189> the

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
out nidoking because he has then the

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.819 
out nidoking because he has then the
counter<00:01:38.790> to<00:01:39.000> my<00:01:39.150> hydrogue<00:01:39.600> encounter<00:01:40.140> in<00:01:40.320> nado

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
counter to my hydrogue encounter in nado

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:42.260 
counter to my hydrogue encounter in nado
King<00:01:41.130> I<00:01:41.189> don't<00:01:41.310> only<00:01:41.400> wanted<00:01:41.670> a<00:01:41.729> sludge<00:01:42.000> lave

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
King I don't only wanted a sludge lave

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:43.910 
King I don't only wanted a sludge lave
I'm<00:01:42.479> thinking<00:01:42.780> maybe<00:01:42.960> he<00:01:43.140> might<00:01:43.439> predict<00:01:43.799> me

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
I'm thinking maybe he might predict me

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.230 
I'm thinking maybe he might predict me
to<00:01:44.009> switch<00:01:44.280> because<00:01:44.430> putting<00:01:44.729> is<00:01:44.850> awfully

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
to switch because putting is awfully

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.920 
to switch because putting is awfully
awfully<00:01:46.189> the<00:01:47.189> obvious<00:01:48.119> but<00:01:48.329> i<00:01:48.360> figured<00:01:48.689> i<00:01:48.780> have

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
awfully the obvious but i figured i have

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.539 
awfully the obvious but i figured i have
star<00:01:49.259> me<00:01:49.439> if<00:01:49.590> you<00:01:49.649> want<00:01:49.829> to<00:01:49.920> kill<00:01:50.100> Starman

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
star me if you want to kill Starman

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.039 
star me if you want to kill Starman
something<00:01:50.909> that's<00:01:51.030> totally<00:01:51.240> fine<00:01:51.659> i'll<00:01:51.899> be

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
something that's totally fine i'll be

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:53.510 
something that's totally fine i'll be
okay<00:01:52.290> with<00:01:52.439> that<00:01:52.590> and<00:01:52.740> this<00:01:52.829> army<00:01:53.130> does<00:01:53.340> go

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
okay with that and this army does go

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.350 
okay with that and this army does go
down<00:01:53.549> so<00:01:54.479> now<00:01:54.810> we<00:01:54.869> have<00:01:55.079> weevil<00:01:55.770> and<00:01:56.360> weevils

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
down so now we have weevil and weevils

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:58.440 
down so now we have weevil and weevils
coming<00:01:57.689> in<00:01:57.840> and

00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:58.450 
coming in and

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:00.179 
coming in and
he's<00:01:58.990> gonna<00:01:59.200> threaten<00:01:59.500> out<00:01:59.710> I<00:01:59.740> should<00:01:59.890> have

00:02:00.179 --> 00:02:00.189 
he's gonna threaten out I should have

00:02:00.189 --> 00:02:01.800 
he's gonna threaten out I should have
gone<00:02:00.430> for<00:02:00.700> a<00:02:00.789> knockoff<00:02:01.180> by<00:02:01.390> figuring<00:02:01.719> of

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:01.810 
gone for a knockoff by figuring of

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:05.190 
gone for a knockoff by figuring of
didn't<00:02:02.289> predict<00:02:02.649> me<00:02:02.890> to<00:02:03.009> switch<00:02:03.659> last<00:02:04.659> time<00:02:04.960> so

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:05.200 
didn't predict me to switch last time so

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:06.779 
didn't predict me to switch last time so
I<00:02:05.229> don't<00:02:05.560> know<00:02:05.649> how<00:02:05.770> obvious<00:02:06.009> his<00:02:06.460> switch

00:02:06.779 --> 00:02:06.789 
I don't know how obvious his switch

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:08.490 
I don't know how obvious his switch
there's<00:02:07.090> gonna<00:02:07.329> be<00:02:07.539> but<00:02:07.780> I<00:02:07.810> just<00:02:08.050> go<00:02:08.170> from<00:02:08.289> ice

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:08.500 
there's gonna be but I just go from ice

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:10.770 
there's gonna be but I just go from ice
punch<00:02:08.769> worse<00:02:09.069> come<00:02:09.280> to<00:02:09.310> worse<00:02:09.550> it's<00:02:10.450> my<00:02:10.569> look

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:10.780 
punch worse come to worse it's my look

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:12.150 
punch worse come to worse it's my look
I'm<00:02:10.899> not<00:02:11.019> too<00:02:11.200> concerned<00:02:11.379> about<00:02:11.650> it<00:02:11.800> because<00:02:11.980> I

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.160 
I'm not too concerned about it because I

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:14.220 
I'm not too concerned about it because I
have<00:02:12.400> a<00:02:12.430> megaman<00:02:12.910> at<00:02:13.030> rincon<00:02:13.390> napping<00:02:13.780> is<00:02:13.930> like

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.230 
have a megaman at rincon napping is like

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:16.140 
have a megaman at rincon napping is like
a<00:02:14.260> hundred<00:02:14.560> percent<00:02:14.860> going<00:02:15.370> to<00:02:15.519> be<00:02:15.670> milotic

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
a hundred percent going to be milotic

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.150 
a hundred percent going to be milotic
every<00:02:16.510> single<00:02:16.840> time<00:02:17.019> but<00:02:17.650> I<00:02:17.680> also<00:02:17.920> ethical

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.160 
every single time but I also ethical

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:19.559 
every single time but I also ethical
theory<00:02:18.580> doesn't<00:02:18.730> care<00:02:18.970> if<00:02:19.060> it<00:02:19.150> gets<00:02:19.269> burned

00:02:19.559 --> 00:02:19.569 
theory doesn't care if it gets burned

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:22.020 
theory doesn't care if it gets burned
and<00:02:19.840> has<00:02:20.170> an<00:02:20.380> all<00:02:20.650> right<00:02:21.160> special<00:02:21.610> offense

that<00:02:22.239> takes<00:02:22.599> 40<00:02:22.900> damage<00:02:23.080> we<00:02:23.650> both<00:02:23.860> have<00:02:24.099> left

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370 
that takes 40 damage we both have left

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:26.130 
that takes 40 damage we both have left
over<00:02:24.640> so<00:02:24.849> i'll<00:02:25.090> be<00:02:25.180> getting<00:02:25.269> HP<00:02:25.630> back<00:02:25.780> as<00:02:25.930> well

over so i'll be getting HP back as well

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:27.660 
over so i'll be getting HP back as well
and<00:02:26.260> he<00:02:26.380> can't<00:02:26.650> do<00:02:26.799> much<00:02:26.980> to<00:02:27.160> me<00:02:27.280> my<00:02:27.400> loaded

switch is the strange switch but i guess
he<00:03:02.590> just<00:03:02.620> wanted<00:03:02.769> to<00:03:03.190> he<00:03:03.760> knew<00:03:03.910> i<00:03:03.940> was<00:03:04.030> gonna

die to live for but he wanted to get
something<00:03:05.799> in<00:03:06.010> and<00:03:06.280> you<00:03:06.609> wanted<00:03:06.790> to<00:03:06.850> get<00:03:06.940> mega

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:07.150 
something in and you wanted to get mega

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:09.720 
something in and you wanted to get mega
Ambrose<00:03:07.540> him<00:03:07.750> I<00:03:07.870> guess<00:03:08.079> you<00:03:08.319> know<00:03:08.700> go<00:03:09.700> to

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:09.730 
Ambrose him I guess you know go to

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:13.199 
Ambrose him I guess you know go to
metric<00:03:10.299> and<00:03:10.450> now<00:03:10.630> here<00:03:11.430> I'm<00:03:12.430> predicting<00:03:13.000> him

00:03:13.199 --> 00:03:13.209 
metric and now here I'm predicting him

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:15.750 
metric and now here I'm predicting him
just<00:03:13.420> to<00:03:13.690> become<00:03:14.079> mega<00:03:14.350> or<00:03:14.650> switch<00:03:15.459> turn<00:03:15.639> it

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:15.760 
just to become mega or switch turn it

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:17.099 
just to become mega or switch turn it
okay<00:03:16.030> and<00:03:16.060> predicting<00:03:16.450> me<00:03:16.569> 2<00:03:16.660> volts<00:03:16.930> which

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:17.109 
okay and predicting me 2 volts which

00:03:17.109 --> 00:03:19.170 
okay and predicting me 2 volts which
obviously<00:03:17.769> the<00:03:18.130> become<00:03:18.459> mega<00:03:18.670> is<00:03:18.880> a<00:03:18.910> less

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:19.180 
obviously the become mega is a less

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:21.539 
obviously the become mega is a less
about<00:03:19.510> doing<00:03:19.930> it<00:03:20.049> as<00:03:20.200> a<00:03:20.230> result<00:03:20.560> of<00:03:20.709> me<00:03:20.920> you

00:03:21.539 --> 00:03:21.549 
about doing it as a result of me you

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:23.250 
about doing it as a result of me you
know<00:03:21.609> being<00:03:21.910> in<00:03:22.030> here<00:03:22.239> and<00:03:22.389> more<00:03:22.540> as<00:03:22.720> a<00:03:22.750> result

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:23.260 
know being in here and more as a result

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.680

a focus ash not too concerned and he

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:57.120 
a focus ash not too concerned and he

right<00:04:00.700> now<00:04:01.450> I<00:04:01.480> really<00:04:02.019> thought<00:04:02.410> that<00:04:02.470> this

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:02.829 
right now I really thought that this

right now I really thought that this
point<00:04:03.160> he<00:04:03.310> was<00:04:03.370> gonna<00:04:03.519> predict<00:04:04.030> my<00:04:04.209> bullet

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:04.540 
point he was gonna predict my bullet

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:06.330 
point he was gonna predict my bullet
scene<00:04:04.720> and<00:04:04.900> go<00:04:04.989> to<00:04:05.200> hide<00:04:05.410> reganes<00:04:05.799> Hydra<00:04:06.250> has

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:07.880 
probably scarf and eat that

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:10.030 
probably scarf and eat that
 up<00:04:08.210> like<00:04:08.510> it's<00:04:08.720> nobody's<00:04:08.960> business<00:04:09.500> but
