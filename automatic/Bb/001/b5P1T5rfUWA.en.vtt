00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.170 
player but he might be a little bit
outclassed<00:02:23.680> by<00:02:23.860> just<00:02:24.280> the<00:02:24.340> sheer<00:02:24.430> mechanic

outclassed by just the sheer mechanic
from<00:02:25.390> killer<00:02:25.720> and<00:02:26.310> so<00:02:27.310> when<00:02:27.970> he<00:02:28.150> knows<00:02:28.360> that<00:02:28.390> or

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:46.610 
through 40-minute games then they get

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:49.569 
through 40-minute games then they get

he's not in a huge lot of trouble if he

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:29.890 
he's not in a huge lot of trouble if he

the gate and back stretching actually

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:34.420 
the gate and back stretching actually
glitched<00:03:33.019> a<00:03:33.200> drone<00:03:33.560> through<00:03:33.859> the<00:03:33.950> minerals<00:03:34.280> so

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:34.430 
glitched a drone through the minerals so

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:36.429 
glitched a drone through the minerals so
they<00:03:34.489> could<00:03:34.639> throw<00:03:34.819> down<00:03:35.060> another<00:03:35.510> expansion

00:03:36.429 --> 00:03:36.439 
they could throw down another expansion

00:03:36.439 --> 00:03:40.030 
they could throw down another expansion
behind<00:03:37.189> his<00:03:37.400> natural<00:03:38.349> as<00:03:39.349> could<00:03:39.560> be<00:03:39.590> very<00:03:39.889> very

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:40.040 
behind his natural as could be very very

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:41.860 
behind his natural as could be very very
hard<00:03:40.310> to<00:03:40.430> harass<00:03:40.730> unless<00:03:41.090> Watson<00:03:41.569> gets<00:03:41.660> out<00:03:41.840> a

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:41.870 
hard to harass unless Watson gets out a

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:44.289 
hard to harass unless Watson gets out a
dropship<00:03:42.769> like<00:03:42.980> I've<00:03:43.129> seen<00:03:43.310> him<00:03:43.430> do<00:03:43.609> against

00:03:44.289 --> 00:03:44.299 
dropship like I've seen him do against

00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:47.800 
dropship like I've seen him do against
mini<00:03:44.599> mini<00:03:44.780> Zerg<00:03:45.819> but<00:03:46.819> he<00:03:47.000> wason<00:03:47.690> is

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:47.810 
mini mini Zerg but he wason is

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:50.080 
mini mini Zerg but he wason is
definitely<00:03:48.199> going<00:03:48.319> to<00:03:48.379> have<00:03:48.560> the<00:03:49.160> economic

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:50.090 
definitely going to have the economic

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:52.539 
definitely going to have the economic
advantage<00:03:50.989> for<00:03:51.620> a<00:03:51.650> little<00:03:51.859> bit<00:03:52.040> longer<00:03:52.250> even

00:03:52.539 --> 00:03:52.549 
advantage for a little bit longer even

00:03:52.549 --> 00:03:53.890 
advantage for a little bit longer even
though<00:03:52.730> killer<00:03:53.000> he's<00:03:53.299> throwing<00:03:53.569> down<00:03:53.690> another

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:53.900 
though killer he's throwing down another

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:56.500 
though killer he's throwing down another
hatchery<00:03:54.379> just<00:03:55.340> now<00:03:55.549> going<00:03:55.849> to<00:03:56.000> get<00:03:56.150> down<00:03:56.269> his

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:56.510 
hatchery just now going to get down his

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:58.899 
hatchery just now going to get down his
lair<00:03:56.810> so<00:03:57.349> I<00:03:57.590> think<00:03:57.769> Watson<00:03:58.069> he's<00:03:58.549> going<00:03:58.699> to<00:03:58.760> run

00:03:58.899 --> 00:03:58.909 
lair so I think Watson he's going to run

00:03:58.909 --> 00:04:00.280 
lair so I think Watson he's going to run
back<00:03:59.120> and<00:03:59.150> forth<00:03:59.329> between<00:03:59.599> the<00:03:59.900> natural<00:04:00.049> and

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:00.290 
back and forth between the natural and

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:02.349 
back and forth between the natural and
the<00:04:00.409> main<00:04:00.620> he's<00:04:00.859> going<00:04:01.040> to<00:04:01.159> see<00:04:01.280> well<00:04:01.549> there<00:04:02.209> is

00:04:02.349 --> 00:04:02.359 
the main he's going to see well there is

00:04:02.359 --> 00:04:04.330 
the main he's going to see well there is
no<00:04:02.659> layer<00:04:03.019> here<00:04:03.379> so<00:04:03.650> I<00:04:03.680> know<00:04:03.739> he<00:04:03.949> has<00:04:04.069> a<00:04:04.099> base

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:04.340 
no layer here so I know he has a base

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:06.399 
no layer here so I know he has a base
somewhere<00:04:04.609> else<00:04:05.030> even<00:04:05.659> though<00:04:05.750> I<00:04:05.780> don't<00:04:06.139> think

00:04:06.399 --> 00:04:06.409 
somewhere else even though I don't think

00:04:06.409 --> 00:04:08.770 
somewhere else even though I don't think
he'd<00:04:06.530> I<00:04:06.739> don't<00:04:07.069> think<00:04:07.129> he<00:04:07.310> scouted<00:04:07.609> the<00:04:07.909> base

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:08.780 
he'd I don't think he scouted the base
