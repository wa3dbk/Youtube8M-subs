00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:42.290 
do not think that way because there's

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:46.449 
do not think that way because there's
still<00:02:42.560> many<00:02:42.740> people<00:02:43.390> way<00:02:44.440> below<00:02:45.440> Town<00:02:45.860> Hall<00:02:45.890> 10

Town<00:02:48.950> Hall<00:02:49.190> yes<00:02:49.489> it<00:02:49.730> may<00:02:49.880> satisfy<00:02:50.180> the<00:02:50.510> top

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:50.840

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:53.860 
Town Hall yes it may satisfy the top
layers<00:02:51.110> but<00:02:51.860> majority<00:02:52.040> of<00:02:52.370> clashers<00:02:52.940> will<00:02:53.690> not

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:53.870 
layers but majority of clashers will not

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:56.380 
layers but majority of clashers will not
be<00:02:54.050> happy<00:02:54.410> about<00:02:54.440> it<00:02:54.770> because<00:02:55.040> new<00:02:55.850> upgrades

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:56.390 
be happy about it because new upgrades

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:59.949 
be happy about it because new upgrades
that<00:02:56.750> means<00:02:57.020> more<00:02:57.440> delays<00:02:58.060> more<00:02:59.060> gems<00:02:59.300> I<00:02:59.570> do

00:02:59.949 --> 00:02:59.959 
that means more delays more gems I do

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:03.090 
that means more delays more gems I do
think<00:03:00.590> that<00:03:00.680> there<00:03:01.130> will<00:03:01.280> be<00:03:01.310> quite<00:03:01.760> few

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:03.100 
think that there will be quite few

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:05.830 
think that there will be quite few
substantial<00:03:04.100> improvement<00:03:04.810> definitely<00:03:05.810> I

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:05.840 
substantial improvement definitely I

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:08.320 
substantial improvement definitely I
think<00:03:05.989> we're<00:03:06.530> going<00:03:06.860> to<00:03:07.070> see<00:03:07.100> some<00:03:07.459> upgrades

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:08.330 
think we're going to see some upgrades

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:12.150 
think we're going to see some upgrades
to<00:03:08.630> existing<00:03:08.980> defenses<00:03:09.980> and<00:03:10.970> what<00:03:11.750> I<00:03:11.780> think

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:12.160 
to existing defenses and what I think

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:14.530 
to existing defenses and what I think
supercell<00:03:13.160> is<00:03:13.310> going<00:03:13.459> to<00:03:13.520> do<00:03:13.640> again<00:03:13.940> this<00:03:14.360> is

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:14.540 
supercell is going to do again this is

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:15.940 
supercell is going to do again this is
just<00:03:14.690> my<00:03:14.870> speculation<00:03:15.110> there<00:03:15.739> are<00:03:15.800> some

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:15.950 
just my speculation there are some

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:17.710 
just my speculation there are some
youtubers<00:03:16.400> they're<00:03:16.610> saying<00:03:16.880> they<00:03:17.480> have

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:17.720 
youtubers they're saying they have

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:20.650 
youtubers they're saying they have

Tesla's being kind of put them on the

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:44.950 
back end the last one we've seen was

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:48.550 
back end the last one we've seen was
somewhere<00:03:45.950> may<00:03:46.610> I<00:03:46.880> believe<00:03:47.209> 2013<00:03:48.079> or<00:03:48.230> closer

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:48.560 
somewhere may I believe 2013 or closer

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:51.220 
somewhere may I believe 2013 or closer
to<00:03:48.680> an<00:03:48.920> end<00:03:49.100> I<00:03:49.280> don't<00:03:49.700> remember<00:03:49.820> one<00:03:50.180> but<00:03:50.480> I<00:03:50.720> do

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:51.230 
to an end I don't remember one but I do

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:55.030 
to an end I don't remember one but I do
think<00:03:51.700> supercell<00:03:52.700> will<00:03:52.880> introduce<00:03:54.040> level

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:55.040 
think supercell will introduce level

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:58.449 
think supercell will introduce level
eight<00:03:55.220> I<00:03:55.489> could<00:03:56.060> be<00:03:56.180> totally<00:03:56.329> wrong<00:03:56.570> but<00:03:57.459> we

00:03:58.449 --> 00:03:58.459 
eight I could be totally wrong but we

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:00.850 
eight I could be totally wrong but we
may<00:03:58.610> see<00:03:58.670> that<00:03:59.000> I<00:03:59.239> also<00:03:59.750> think<00:04:00.140> that<00:04:00.290> we<00:04:00.620> may

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:00.860 
may see that I also think that we may

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:04.240 
may see that I also think that we may
see<00:04:00.920> new<00:04:01.400> upgraded<00:04:01.970> cannon<00:04:02.660> to<00:04:03.200> level<00:04:03.560> 13<00:04:03.980> I

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:04.250 
see new upgraded cannon to level 13 I

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:06.580 
see new upgraded cannon to level 13 I
could<00:04:04.730> be<00:04:04.820> totally<00:04:04.970> wrong<00:04:05.180> again<00:04:05.690> I<00:04:05.900> don't

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:06.590 
could be totally wrong again I don't

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:08.009 
could be totally wrong again I don't
think<00:04:06.769> that<00:04:06.829> supercell<00:04:07.430> will<00:04:07.579> introduce

00:04:08.009 --> 00:04:08.019 
think that supercell will introduce

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:10.750 
think that supercell will introduce
absolutely<00:04:09.019> brand-new<00:04:09.440> defense<00:04:10.310> because

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:10.760 
absolutely brand-new defense because

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:14.080 
absolutely brand-new defense because
with<00:04:11.660> inferno<00:04:12.230> towers<00:04:12.500> and<00:04:12.920> multi-level<00:04:13.549> it's

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:14.090 
with inferno towers and multi-level it's

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:17.289 
with inferno towers and multi-level it's
going<00:04:14.239> to<00:04:14.299> be<00:04:14.390> way<00:04:14.600> too<00:04:14.660> much<00:04:15.280> so<00:04:16.299> that's

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:17.299 
going to be way too much so that's

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:18.969 
going to be way too much so that's
pretty<00:04:17.570> much<00:04:17.660> it<00:04:17.959> I<00:04:18.229> don't<00:04:18.500> think<00:04:18.680> any<00:04:18.890> other

00:04:18.969 --> 00:04:18.979 
pretty much it I don't think any other

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:21.580 
pretty much it I don't think any other
troops<00:04:19.579> or<00:04:19.790> any<00:04:20.060> other<00:04:20.269> sorry<00:04:20.900> defenses<00:04:21.440> will

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:21.590 
troops or any other sorry defenses will

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:23.920 
troops or any other sorry defenses will
be<00:04:21.709> upgraded<00:04:22.190> I<00:04:22.340> do<00:04:22.669> think<00:04:23.030> that<00:04:23.090> Tesla<00:04:23.750> or

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:23.930 
be upgraded I do think that Tesla or

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:26.380 
be upgraded I do think that Tesla or
cannon<00:04:24.440> will<00:04:24.950> probably<00:04:25.370> get<00:04:25.490> a<00:04:25.550> little<00:04:26.180> bump

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:26.390 
cannon will probably get a little bump

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:27.100 
cannon will probably get a little bump
up

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:27.110 
up

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:29.860 
up
now<00:04:27.650> what<00:04:28.009> I<00:04:28.039> think<00:04:28.280> about<00:04:28.370> else<00:04:28.939> I<00:04:29.330> do<00:04:29.449> think

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:29.870 
now what I think about else I do think

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:31.570 
now what I think about else I do think
that<00:04:29.990> supercell<00:04:30.560> would<00:04:30.740> have<00:04:30.949> to<00:04:31.129> introduce<00:04:31.280> a

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:31.580 
that supercell would have to introduce a

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:33.339 
that supercell would have to introduce a
new<00:04:31.729> true<00:04:31.939> it's<00:04:32.419> been<00:04:32.629> a<00:04:32.659> while<00:04:32.870> since<00:04:33.110> we've

00:04:33.339 --> 00:04:33.349 
new true it's been a while since we've

00:04:33.349 --> 00:04:35.920 
new true it's been a while since we've
seen<00:04:33.379> one<00:04:33.770> especially<00:04:34.310> dark<00:04:35.180> elixir<00:04:35.449> troops

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:35.930 
seen one especially dark elixir troops

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:38.320 
seen one especially dark elixir troops
so<00:04:36.530> I<00:04:36.919> do<00:04:37.039> think<00:04:37.460> that<00:04:37.520> either<00:04:37.879> we're<00:04:38.120> going<00:04:38.270> to

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:38.330 
so I do think that either we're going to

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:40.719 
so I do think that either we're going to
see<00:04:38.569> medians<00:04:39.110> level<00:04:39.530> 6<00:04:39.830> or<00:04:40.069> we're<00:04:40.550> going<00:04:40.669> to

00:04:40.719 --> 00:04:40.729 
see medians level 6 or we're going to

00:04:40.729 --> 00:04:43.990 
see medians level 6 or we're going to
see<00:04:40.879> a<00:04:40.909> brand<00:04:41.270> new<00:04:41.449> troop<00:04:41.719> that<00:04:42.289> will<00:04:42.800> help<00:04:43.069> to

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:44.000 
see a brand new troop that will help to

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.249 
see a brand new troop that will help to
deal<00:04:44.539> with<00:04:44.900> that<00:04:45.139> multi<00:04:45.819> defense<00:04:46.819> of<00:04:47.389> inferno

00:04:48.249 --> 00:04:48.259 
deal with that multi defense of inferno

00:04:48.259 --> 00:04:50.619 
deal with that multi defense of inferno
towers<00:04:48.469> because<00:04:49.370> right<00:04:49.520> now<00:04:49.550> you<00:04:49.699> know<00:04:49.939> golem

00:04:50.619 --> 00:04:50.629 
towers because right now you know golem

00:04:50.629 --> 00:04:54.670 
towers because right now you know golem
or<00:04:51.789> witches<00:04:52.789> and<00:04:53.120> wizards<00:04:53.750> are<00:04:54.169> not<00:04:54.409> as

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:54.680 
or witches and wizards are not as

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:56.439 
or witches and wizards are not as
effective<00:04:55.129> they<00:04:55.250> are<00:04:55.370> still<00:04:55.819> a<00:04:55.879> lot<00:04:56.150> of<00:04:56.210> people

00:04:56.439 --> 00:04:56.449 
effective they are still a lot of people

00:04:56.449 --> 00:04:59.230 
effective they are still a lot of people
are<00:04:56.599> using<00:04:56.750> them<00:04:57.050> with<00:04:57.520> free<00:04:58.520> spell<00:04:58.879> but

00:04:59.230 --> 00:04:59.240 
are using them with free spell but

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:01.480 
are using them with free spell but
they're<00:04:59.539> not<00:04:59.689> as<00:04:59.840> effective<00:05:00.349> the<00:05:00.529> golems<00:05:01.310> are

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:01.490 
they're not as effective the golems are

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:03.279 
they're not as effective the golems are
not<00:05:01.699> effective<00:05:02.150> as<00:05:02.270> it<00:05:02.419> used<00:05:02.599> to<00:05:02.689> be<00:05:02.870> against

00:05:03.279 --> 00:05:03.289 
not effective as it used to be against

00:05:03.289 --> 00:05:06.189 
not effective as it used to be against
the<00:05:03.409> level<00:05:04.099> 3<00:05:04.279> Inferno<00:05:05.210> tower<00:05:05.360> so<00:05:05.659> I<00:05:05.689> do<00:05:05.840> think

00:05:06.189 --> 00:05:06.199 
the level 3 Inferno tower so I do think

00:05:06.199 --> 00:05:07.929 
the level 3 Inferno tower so I do think
we're<00:05:06.379> going<00:05:06.529> to<00:05:06.620> see<00:05:06.650> either<00:05:07.039> bring<00:05:07.759> your

00:05:07.929 --> 00:05:07.939 
we're going to see either bring your

00:05:07.939 --> 00:05:10.059 
we're going to see either bring your
troop<00:05:08.180> or<00:05:08.300> we're<00:05:09.139> going<00:05:09.289> to<00:05:09.379> see<00:05:09.620> a<00:05:09.650> brand<00:05:09.949> new

00:05:10.059 --> 00:05:10.069 
troop or we're going to see a brand new

00:05:10.069 --> 00:05:11.980 
troop or we're going to see a brand new
spell<00:05:10.520> which<00:05:11.000> is<00:05:11.120> going<00:05:11.210> to<00:05:11.270> be<00:05:11.360> either<00:05:11.779> way

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:11.990 
spell which is going to be either way

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:13.809 
spell which is going to be either way
going<00:05:12.169> to<00:05:12.229> be<00:05:12.349> very<00:05:12.529> exciting<00:05:13.069> there's

00:05:13.809 --> 00:05:13.819 
going to be very exciting there's

00:05:13.819 --> 00:05:15.369 
going to be very exciting there's
probably<00:05:14.029> going<00:05:14.300> to<00:05:14.360> be<00:05:14.419> also<00:05:14.629> minor<00:05:14.990> tweaks

00:05:15.369 --> 00:05:15.379 
probably going to be also minor tweaks

00:05:15.379 --> 00:05:22.360 
probably going to be also minor tweaks
to<00:05:18.310> loot<00:05:19.509> maybe<00:05:20.830> could<00:05:21.830> be<00:05:21.860> rollin<00:05:22.279> again

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:22.370 
to loot maybe could be rollin again

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:23.980 
to loot maybe could be rollin again
because<00:05:22.909> there's<00:05:23.180> a<00:05:23.270> lot<00:05:23.779> of<00:05:23.810> people

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:23.990 
because there's a lot of people

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:25.990 
because there's a lot of people
complaining<00:05:24.199> about<00:05:24.620> it<00:05:24.740> losing<00:05:25.580> way<00:05:25.729> too<00:05:25.759> much

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:26.000 
complaining about it losing way too much

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.659 
complaining about it losing way too much
lid<00:05:26.270> but<00:05:26.479> nevertheless<00:05:27.289> those<00:05:28.219> tweaks<00:05:28.490> are

00:05:28.659 --> 00:05:28.669 
lid but nevertheless those tweaks are

00:05:28.669 --> 00:05:30.249 
lid but nevertheless those tweaks are
always<00:05:28.909> happening<00:05:29.120> every<00:05:29.539> time<00:05:29.719> is<00:05:29.930> you<00:05:30.110> know

00:05:30.249 --> 00:05:30.259 
always happening every time is you know

00:05:30.259 --> 00:05:32.409 
always happening every time is you know
so<00:05:30.800> I'm<00:05:30.949> not<00:05:31.069> even<00:05:31.129> going<00:05:31.310> to<00:05:31.520> concentrate<00:05:31.849> so

00:05:32.409 --> 00:05:32.419 
so I'm not even going to concentrate so

00:05:32.419 --> 00:05:34.480 
so I'm not even going to concentrate so
the<00:05:32.539> bottom<00:05:32.659> line<00:05:32.810> is<00:05:32.960> this<00:05:33.770> is<00:05:33.949> just<00:05:34.279> my

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:34.490 
the bottom line is this is just my

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:35.950 
the bottom line is this is just my
assumption<00:05:35.000> I<00:05:35.180> do<00:05:35.240> think<00:05:35.509> we're<00:05:35.719> going<00:05:35.839> to<00:05:35.930> see

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:35.960 
assumption I do think we're going to see

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:38.860 
assumption I do think we're going to see
new<00:05:36.469> level<00:05:36.800> Tesla<00:05:37.219> or<00:05:37.430> new<00:05:37.849> level<00:05:38.150> cannon<00:05:38.479> I<00:05:38.629> do

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:38.870 
new level Tesla or new level cannon I do

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:40.420 
new level Tesla or new level cannon I do
think<00:05:39.229> we're<00:05:39.379> going<00:05:39.469> to<00:05:39.560> see<00:05:39.589> a<00:05:39.979> brand-new

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:40.430 
think we're going to see a brand-new

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:42.640 
think we're going to see a brand-new
dark<00:05:40.669> elixir<00:05:40.879> troop<00:05:41.330> or<00:05:41.449> we<00:05:41.839> may<00:05:42.020> see<00:05:42.080> a<00:05:42.319> bomb

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:42.650 
dark elixir troop or we may see a bomb

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:44.589 
dark elixir troop or we may see a bomb
pop<00:05:42.830> to<00:05:43.099> minions<00:05:43.460> because<00:05:43.969> they<00:05:44.120> were<00:05:44.180> kind<00:05:44.479> of

00:05:44.589 --> 00:05:44.599 
pop to minions because they were kind of

00:05:44.599 --> 00:05:47.339 
pop to minions because they were kind of
put<00:05:45.169> in<00:05:45.289> the<00:05:45.349> back<00:05:45.500> end<00:05:45.710> at<00:05:46.250> this<00:05:46.370> point<00:05:46.610> so<00:05:46.940> and

00:05:47.339 --> 00:05:47.349 
put in the back end at this point so and

00:05:47.349 --> 00:05:50.499 
put in the back end at this point so and
at<00:05:48.349> last<00:05:48.560> I<00:05:48.800> do<00:05:48.889> think<00:05:49.370> that<00:05:49.460> Valkyries<00:05:50.300> are

00:05:50.499 --> 00:05:50.509 
at last I do think that Valkyries are

00:05:50.509 --> 00:05:52.510 
at last I do think that Valkyries are
going<00:05:50.659> to<00:05:50.719> have<00:05:50.900> some<00:05:51.289> kind<00:05:51.650> of<00:05:51.800> improvement

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:52.520 
going to have some kind of improvement

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:55.450 
going to have some kind of improvement
either<00:05:53.029> reduced<00:05:53.839> training<00:05:54.440> time<00:05:54.680> and<00:05:55.069> costs

00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:55.460 
either reduced training time and costs

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:58.149 
either reduced training time and costs
or<00:05:55.729> increase<00:05:56.360> damage<00:05:56.960> or<00:05:57.319> perhaps<00:05:57.620> that<00:05:58.069> will

00:05:58.149 --> 00:05:58.159 
or increase damage or perhaps that will

00:05:58.159 --> 00:06:00.579 
or increase damage or perhaps that will
be<00:05:58.279> targeting<00:05:58.699> one<00:05:58.909> particular<00:05:59.419> level<00:06:00.409> of

00:06:00.579 --> 00:06:00.589 
be targeting one particular level of

00:06:00.589 --> 00:06:02.649 
be targeting one particular level of
defense<00:06:01.250> so<00:06:01.460> either<00:06:01.639> way<00:06:01.879> I'm<00:06:02.300> very<00:06:02.539> excited

00:06:02.649 --> 00:06:02.659 
defense so either way I'm very excited

00:06:02.659 --> 00:06:05.019 
defense so either way I'm very excited
with<00:06:03.349> every<00:06:03.710> update<00:06:03.889> I<00:06:04.310> hope<00:06:04.669> there's<00:06:04.909> going

00:06:05.019 --> 00:06:05.029 
with every update I hope there's going

00:06:05.029 --> 00:06:07.540 
with every update I hope there's going
to<00:06:05.089> be<00:06:05.150> something<00:06:05.960> to<00:06:06.379> brag<00:06:06.650> about<00:06:06.680> and<00:06:07.250> be

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:07.550 
to be something to brag about and be
