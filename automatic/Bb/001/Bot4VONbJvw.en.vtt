00:01:23.859 --> 00:01:23.869

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:26.050 
slowly building up in dynamics Larry is
is<00:01:24.110> developing<00:01:24.950> his<00:01:25.100> drum<00:01:25.430> part<00:01:25.700> there's<00:01:25.910> all

is developing his drum part there's all
great<00:01:26.330> drummers<00:01:26.720> do<00:01:26.930> they<00:01:27.200> start<00:01:27.500> with

00:01:27.609 --> 00:01:27.619 
great drummers do they start with

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:29.410 
great drummers do they start with
something<00:01:27.670> relatively<00:01:28.670> simple<00:01:28.729> in<00:01:29.090> a<00:01:29.180> song

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:29.420 
something relatively simple in a song

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:31.359 
something relatively simple in a song
and<00:01:29.600> then<00:01:30.080> they<00:01:30.200> add<00:01:30.380> to<00:01:30.740> it<00:01:30.890> as<00:01:31.040> the<00:01:31.160> song

00:01:31.359 --> 00:01:31.369 
and then they add to it as the song

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:35.440 
and then they add to it as the song
progresses<00:01:32.050> and<00:01:33.050> I<00:01:33.680> love<00:01:34.369> this<00:01:34.520> kind<00:01:34.790> of<00:01:34.880> drum

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:35.450 
progresses and I love this kind of drum

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:37.540 
progresses and I love this kind of drum
writing<00:01:35.930> where<00:01:36.110> you<00:01:36.650> take<00:01:36.890> something<00:01:37.160> simple

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:37.550 
writing where you take something simple

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:39.730 
writing where you take something simple
and<00:01:37.610> you<00:01:37.700> just<00:01:37.850> add<00:01:38.060> to<00:01:38.270> it<00:01:38.390> and<00:01:38.509> add<00:01:38.630> to<00:01:38.660> it<00:01:38.840> and

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:39.740 
and you just add to it and add to it and

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:41.700 
and you just add to it and add to it and
though<00:01:40.160> he<00:01:40.250> doesn't<00:01:40.369> go<00:01:40.520> over-the-top<00:01:40.729> but

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:41.710 
though he doesn't go over-the-top but

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:44.770 
though he doesn't go over-the-top but
certainly<00:01:42.710> he's<00:01:43.310> altering<00:01:43.760> his<00:01:43.970> part<00:01:44.270> as<00:01:44.510> he

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:44.780 
certainly he's altering his part as he

00:01:44.780 --> 00:02:25.350 
certainly he's altering his part as he
moves<00:01:44.990> along<00:01:45.110> through<00:01:45.440> the<00:01:45.560> song

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:30.479 

so<00:02:26.360> the<00:02:26.480> first<00:02:26.750> bar<00:02:27.470> verse<00:02:28.040> 2<00:02:28.370> is<00:02:28.670> the<00:02:29.510> same

00:02:30.479 --> 00:02:30.489 
so the first bar verse 2 is the same

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:33.100 
so the first bar verse 2 is the same
idea<00:02:31.489> as<00:02:31.640> before<00:02:31.670> except<00:02:32.360> now<00:02:32.510> we<00:02:32.569> are<00:02:32.989> left

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:33.110 
idea as before except now we are left

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:34.720 
idea as before except now we are left
hand<00:02:33.380> plays<00:02:33.590> on<00:02:33.739> the<00:02:33.860> snare<00:02:34.130> drum<00:02:34.190> and<00:02:34.610> we're

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:59.590 
when we hit the floor Tom and bass drum
at<00:02:57.530> the<00:02:57.650> same<00:02:57.739> time<00:02:58.160> the<00:02:58.340> hi-hat<00:02:58.700> foot<00:02:59.060> closes

00:02:59.590 --> 00:02:59.600 
at the same time the hi-hat foot closes

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:03.130 
at the same time the hi-hat foot closes
on<00:02:59.810> one<00:03:00.230> so<00:03:00.860> we<00:03:00.950> get<00:03:01.130> one<00:03:01.790> for<00:03:02.540> the<00:03:02.630> foot<00:03:02.989> ball

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:03.140 
on one so we get one for the foot ball

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.550 
on one so we get one for the foot ball
one

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:03.560 
one

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:08.220 
one
so<00:03:04.280> the<00:03:04.370> first<00:03:04.549> bar<00:03:04.790> one<00:03:05.450> and<00:03:05.750> two<00:03:06.380> and<00:03:06.680> three

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:08.230 
so the first bar one and two and three

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:11.410 
so the first bar one and two and three
okay<00:03:09.230> then<00:03:09.860> the<00:03:10.010> second<00:03:10.430> bar<00:03:10.610> starts<00:03:11.120> the<00:03:11.209> same

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:11.420 
okay then the second bar starts the same

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:14.680 
okay then the second bar starts the same
one<00:03:12.049> and<00:03:12.349> two<00:03:13.040> hands<00:03:13.790> and<00:03:14.180> this<00:03:14.390> is<00:03:14.480> where<00:03:14.630> we

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:14.690 
one and two hands and this is where we

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:17.140 
one and two hands and this is where we
get<00:03:14.810> subtle<00:03:15.230> so<00:03:15.500> the<00:03:16.069> left<00:03:16.340> hand<00:03:16.640> then<00:03:16.910> moves

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:17.150 
get subtle so the left hand then moves

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:20.110 
get subtle so the left hand then moves
over<00:03:17.540> to<00:03:17.569> the<00:03:17.780> floor<00:03:18.080> tom<00:03:18.319> on<00:03:18.560> the<00:03:19.040> of<00:03:19.549> beat<00:03:19.849> two

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:20.120 
over to the floor tom on the of beat two

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:24.759 
over to the floor tom on the of beat two
so<00:03:20.690> in<00:03:20.840> between<00:03:20.959> the<00:03:22.360> eighth<00:03:23.360> notes<00:03:23.750> played<00:03:24.650> by

00:03:24.759 --> 00:03:24.769 
so in between the eighth notes played by

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:26.589 
so in between the eighth notes played by
the<00:03:24.830> right<00:03:25.040> hand<00:03:25.250> on<00:03:25.340> the<00:03:25.459> floor<00:03:25.640> tom<00:03:25.849> on<00:03:26.090> the

00:03:26.589 --> 00:03:26.599 
the right hand on the floor tom on the

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:29.020 
the right hand on the floor tom on the

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:29.030 
and of two and three an extra left hand

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:32.770 
and of two and three an extra left hand
low<00:03:29.150> is<00:03:29.329> added<00:03:29.750> in<00:03:29.900> between<00:03:30.320> and<00:03:31.329> three<00:03:32.329> and

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:35.920 
low is added in between and three and

00:03:57.539 --> 00:03:57.549 
played quietly in fact as quiet as you

00:03:57.549 --> 00:04:00.990 
played quietly in fact as quiet as you

00:04:02.729 --> 00:04:02.739 
this is difficult on the electric drum

this is difficult on the electric drum
kit<00:04:02.769> and<00:04:02.920> I'll<00:04:03.069> do<00:04:03.159> my<00:04:03.280> best<00:04:03.459> to<00:04:03.670> replicate<00:04:04.150> it

but<00:04:04.510> I<00:04:05.170> mean<00:04:05.349> the<00:04:05.500> quieter<00:04:06.159> the<00:04:06.370> more<00:04:06.909> like

00:04:07.199 --> 00:04:07.209 
but I mean the quieter the more like

but I mean the quieter the more like
Larry's<00:04:07.599> part<00:04:07.900> you're<00:04:08.079> going<00:04:08.200> to<00:04:08.290> make<00:04:08.409> it

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:08.560 
Larry's part you're going to make it

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:10.800 
Larry's part you're going to make it
sound<00:04:08.769> you<00:04:09.040> play<00:04:09.310> it<00:04:09.430> loudly<00:04:09.639> it's<00:04:10.090> not<00:04:10.629> going

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:10.810 
sound you play it loudly it's not going

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:12.010 
to sound the same it's going to sound

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:15.270 
to sound the same it's going to sound
off<00:04:12.219> beating<00:04:12.790> weird<00:04:13.060> and<00:04:13.299> quirky<00:04:13.389> but<00:04:14.290> if<00:04:14.590> you

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:15.280 
off beating weird and quirky but if you

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:17.550 
off beating weird and quirky but if you
add<00:04:15.489> in<00:04:15.939> that<00:04:16.090> quiet<00:04:16.449> that<00:04:16.810> note<00:04:16.989> very<00:04:17.380> very

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:17.560 
add in that quiet that note very very

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:20.159 
add in that quiet that note very very
quietly<00:04:18.009> it<00:04:18.579> will<00:04:18.820> sound<00:04:19.030> correct<00:04:19.539> so<00:04:19.810> the

00:04:20.159 --> 00:04:20.169 
quietly it will sound correct so the

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:21.629 
quietly it will sound correct so the
correct<00:04:20.500> dynamic<00:04:21.039> should<00:04:21.220> be<00:04:21.340> something<00:04:21.609> like

00:04:21.629 --> 00:04:21.639 
correct dynamic should be something like

00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:22.260 
correct dynamic should be something like

of four as we did in the bar above it

00:05:58.439 --> 00:06:01.069

00:06:05.929 --> 00:06:05.939 
to close on beat 1 of the next bar as it

00:06:05.939 --> 00:06:09.529 
to close on beat 1 of the next bar as it
did<00:06:06.239> at<00:06:06.389> the<00:06:06.449> beginning<00:06:06.599> of<00:06:06.929> this<00:06:07.079> line<00:06:07.610> so<00:06:08.610> the

00:06:09.529 --> 00:06:09.539 
did at the beginning of this line so the

00:06:09.539 --> 00:06:14.619 
did at the beginning of this line so the
bar<00:06:09.749> played<00:06:10.050> study<00:06:10.379> bar<00:06:10.679> 2<00:06:10.919> played<00:06:11.279> slowly<00:06:13.219> 1<00:06:14.219> &amp;

00:06:14.619 --> 00:06:14.629

00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:47.640 

00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:49.920 

think<00:06:48.640> it's<00:06:48.790> the<00:06:48.880> vocals<00:06:49.330> that<00:06:49.450> are<00:06:49.660> kind<00:06:49.840> of

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:49.930 
think it's the vocals that are kind of

00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:52.260 
think it's the vocals that are kind of
doing<00:06:50.140> something<00:06:50.320> repeat<00:06:50.710> or<00:06:50.860> the<00:06:50.980> melody<00:06:51.270> no

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:52.270 
doing something repeat or the melody no

00:06:52.270 --> 00:06:55.500 
doing something repeat or the melody no
no<00:06:52.600> no<00:06:52.980> no<00:06:53.980> no<00:06:54.250> got<00:06:54.490> that<00:06:54.640> so<00:06:54.760> I<00:06:54.790> tuned<00:06:55.210> I<00:06:55.390> can

00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:55.510 
no no no no got that so I tuned I can

00:06:55.510 --> 00:06:57.060 
no no no no got that so I tuned I can
hear<00:06:55.690> in<00:06:55.780> my<00:06:55.870> head<00:06:55.900> by<00:06:56.230> this<00:06:56.290> can't<00:06:56.620> sing<00:06:56.920> it
