00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:48.670 
flawless and then two of the products I

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:52.560 
flawless and then two of the products I
have<00:04:48.700> from<00:04:48.940> central<00:04:49.330> peg<00:04:49.480> is<00:04:50.250> this<00:04:51.250> and<00:04:51.760> I<00:04:52.150> just

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:52.570 
have from central peg is this and I just

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:53.520 
have from central peg is this and I just
thought<00:04:52.720> that<00:04:52.780> they<00:04:53.050> changed<00:04:53.410> their

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:53.530 
thought that they changed their

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:55.950 
thought that they changed their
packaging<00:04:54.070> so<00:04:54.400> I<00:04:54.700> needed<00:04:55.270> a<00:04:55.420> new<00:04:55.540> bronzing

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:55.960 
packaging so I needed a new bronzing

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:57.540 
packaging so I needed a new bronzing
mousse<00:04:56.140> I<00:04:56.350> think<00:04:56.800> they<00:04:57.040> changed<00:04:57.070> their

00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:57.550 
mousse I think they changed their

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:00.450 
mousse I think they changed their
packaging<00:04:58.030> so<00:04:58.660> I<00:04:58.690> was<00:04:58.930> like<00:04:59.020> okay<00:04:59.380> I<00:04:59.650> don't

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:00.460 
packaging so I was like okay I don't

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:02.730 
packaging so I was like okay I don't
read<00:05:00.730> things<00:05:01.600> and<00:05:01.990> bottles<00:05:02.320> apparently

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:02.740 
read things and bottles apparently

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:04.680 
read things and bottles apparently
because<00:05:03.010> this<00:05:03.130> is<00:05:03.280> the<00:05:03.400> dark<00:05:03.580> formula<00:05:04.090> and<00:05:04.270> I

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:04.690 
because this is the dark formula and I

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:07.260 
because this is the dark formula and I
use<00:05:05.290> this<00:05:05.530> right<00:05:05.800> before<00:05:06.130> I<00:05:06.370> was<00:05:06.730> gonna<00:05:06.880> go<00:05:07.120> out

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:07.270 
use this right before I was gonna go out

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:09.840 
use this right before I was gonna go out
so<00:05:07.660> I<00:05:07.690> took<00:05:07.930> a<00:05:08.140> shower<00:05:08.410> everything<00:05:09.280> put<00:05:09.730> this
