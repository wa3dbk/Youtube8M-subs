have to like golfing in order to find
this<00:00:15.269> fact<00:00:15.509> it<00:00:15.599> really<00:00:15.900> interesting<00:00:16.410> I<00:00:16.619> just<00:00:17.340> I

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
this fact it really interesting I just I

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.480 
this fact it really interesting I just I
thought<00:00:17.789> it<00:00:17.850> was<00:00:17.910> Wiegel<00:00:18.180> so<00:00:19.080> anyway<00:00:19.400> did<00:00:20.400> you

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
thought it was Wiegel so anyway did you

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:21.769 
thought it was Wiegel so anyway did you
know<00:00:20.580> that<00:00:20.730> the<00:00:20.789> first<00:00:21.029> golf<00:00:21.359> balls<00:00:21.570> were

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
know that the first golf balls were

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:24.380 
know that the first golf balls were
actually<00:00:22.199> made<00:00:22.410> like<00:00:22.680> this<00:00:22.890> and<00:00:23.160> yes<00:00:24.090> this<00:00:24.269> is

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
actually made like this and yes this is

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.470 
actually made like this and yes this is
a<00:00:24.420> ping-pong<00:00:24.660> ball<00:00:24.840> but<00:00:25.590> it<00:00:25.830> makes<00:00:25.980> my<00:00:26.099> point

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:26.480 
a ping-pong ball but it makes my point

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:29.689 
a ping-pong ball but it makes my point
so<00:00:27.859> original<00:00:28.859> golf<00:00:29.010> balls<00:00:29.220> didn't<00:00:29.550> actually

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
so original golf balls didn't actually

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.310 
so original golf balls didn't actually
have<00:00:29.970> the<00:00:30.119> dimples<00:00:30.480> it<00:00:30.660> was<00:00:30.779> just<00:00:30.990> a<00:00:31.050> smooth

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
have the dimples it was just a smooth

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.120 
have the dimples it was just a smooth
wooden<00:00:31.679> ball<00:00:32.090> there's<00:00:33.090> just<00:00:33.590> round<00:00:34.590> and<00:00:34.890> I

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
wooden ball there's just round and I

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.250 
wooden ball there's just round and I
really<00:00:35.399> had<00:00:35.520> no<00:00:35.820> design<00:00:36.600> features<00:00:36.930> except<00:00:37.140> for

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
really had no design features except for

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.910 
really had no design features except for
that<00:00:37.430> now<00:00:38.430> the<00:00:38.489> way<00:00:38.850> that<00:00:38.879> we<00:00:39.680> modernized<00:00:40.680> it

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
that now the way that we modernized it

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.819 
that now the way that we modernized it
and<00:00:41.550> put<00:00:41.850> dimples<00:00:42.000> in<00:00:42.300> it<00:00:42.390> was<00:00:43.140> actually<00:00:43.710> by

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
and put dimples in it was actually by

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.600 
and put dimples in it was actually by

so one day when he was scrounging up

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:14.780 
so one day when he was scrounging up
golf<00:01:13.710> balls<00:01:13.920> he<00:01:14.130> realized<00:01:14.430> that<00:01:14.490> he<00:01:14.640> really

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
golf balls he realized that he really

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.410 
golf balls he realized that he really
didn't<00:01:15.000> have<00:01:15.060> any<00:01:15.270> that<00:01:15.420> weren't<00:01:15.890> not<00:01:16.890> on<00:01:17.100> by

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:17.420 
didn't have any that weren't not on by

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:21.590 
didn't have any that weren't not on by
his<00:01:18.420> dog<00:01:18.689> so<00:01:19.560> he<00:01:20.189> just<00:01:20.729> used<00:01:21.000> him<00:01:21.119> anyway<00:01:21.390> he

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
his dog so he just used him anyway he

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.050 
his dog so he just used him anyway he
used<00:01:21.810> the<00:01:21.930> the<00:01:22.380> golf<00:01:22.560> balls<00:01:22.740> that<00:01:22.799> had<00:01:23.070> the<00:01:23.310> the

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
used the the golf balls that had the the

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.969 
used the the golf balls that had the the
teeth<00:01:24.390> imprints<00:01:24.920> from<00:01:25.920> his<00:01:26.220> dog<00:01:26.750> so<00:01:27.979> when

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
teeth imprints from his dog so when

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:30.590 
teeth imprints from his dog so when
using<00:01:29.280> these<00:01:29.400> these<00:01:29.700> golf<00:01:29.970> balls<00:01:30.030> he<00:01:30.450> actually

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
using these these golf balls he actually

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.990 
using these these golf balls he actually
realized<00:01:31.140> that<00:01:31.439> with<00:01:31.829> the<00:01:32.100> teeth<00:01:32.490> marks<00:01:32.790> in<00:01:32.880> it

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
realized that with the teeth marks in it

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.810 
realized that with the teeth marks in it
he<00:01:33.840> got<00:01:34.020> a<00:01:34.079> lot<00:01:34.409> more<00:01:34.439> velocity<00:01:35.009> on<00:01:35.280> the<00:01:35.670> ball

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
he got a lot more velocity on the ball

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.940 
he got a lot more velocity on the ball
and<00:01:36.060> the<00:01:36.180> ball<00:01:36.689> flew<00:01:37.140> a<00:01:37.200> lot<00:01:37.350> straighter<00:01:37.710> than

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
and the ball flew a lot straighter than

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.569 
and the ball flew a lot straighter than
the<00:01:38.220> non<00:01:38.520> dimpled<00:01:39.170> normal<00:01:40.170> golf<00:01:40.290> balls<00:01:40.579> so

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
the non dimpled normal golf balls so

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.960 
the non dimpled normal golf balls so
obviously<00:01:41.970> he<00:01:42.150> took<00:01:42.299> this<00:01:42.450> concept<00:01:42.869> and

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:43.970 
obviously he took this concept and

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:47.210 
obviously he took this concept and
started<00:01:44.970> making<00:01:45.180> putting<00:01:45.990> knife<00:01:46.710> marks<00:01:46.979> in

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
started making putting knife marks in

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.060 
started making putting knife marks in
his<00:01:47.430> ball<00:01:47.930> in<00:01:48.930> order<00:01:49.170> to<00:01:49.320> get<00:01:49.439> that<00:01:49.470> not<00:01:49.890> on

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
his ball in order to get that not on

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.249 
his ball in order to get that not on
effect<00:01:50.399> that<00:01:50.549> his<00:01:50.640> dog<00:01:50.880> had<00:01:51.060> originally<00:01:51.540> done

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
effect that his dog had originally done

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:55.520 
effect that his dog had originally done
to<00:01:52.439> his<00:01:52.560> original<00:01:52.770> couples<00:01:53.490> and<00:01:54.530> obviously
