00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:07.170
 let's calculate the trigonometric equation 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:07.170
 2x sinus 

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:16.810
 equal to kosen de xo we are looking for 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:19.810
 those angles such that the sine of 2 

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:21.840
 by that angle or two angles of ccoo 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:25.490
 sine of said 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.490
 good double angle formulas 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:35.680
 for him we are here x 

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:35.680
 X and this we replace there 

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:44.020
 and we observe that everything that appears here 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:48.850
 we're going to pass this by dragging the other 

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:50.590
 part all the elements of subtraction in 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:55.140
 this case they carry cosine of x then 

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:55.140
 we can draw cosine from x common factor 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:59.280
 2x 

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:03.129
 minus one equal 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:09.320
 that we would have if cosine of x that is 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:12.350
 something for something gives us equal to zero 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:16.270
 cosine dx the first is equal to zero or 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:16.270
 the second and good to zero 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.890
 something we have already seen before in a 

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:25.439
 previous video we have guys in nothing x 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:28.159
 is equal to zero we draw the graph of the 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:28.159
 x 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:51.460
 about 1 and a half and 322 and a half feet in 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:53.860
 good us first about 215 and a half 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:58.710
 here one 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:58.710
 but the 10 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:12.590
 but 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:12.590
 0 - 10 10 - 101 if we will follow these 0 

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:17.400
 2 and 3 and means 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:25.430
 2 P 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:25.430
 5 37 pm 24 pink etcetera 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:33.230
 good espÃ­ in the first three - 2 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:36.170
 less 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:37.640
 five media and so on triangles have 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:41.480
 for things nothing x equals zero 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:42.530
 note that they record x 0 and a half and 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:46.130
 now 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:50.690
 3 first 5 pm - first our 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:53.330
 first all capable of in means of 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:57.200
 cheese and media and add and add and 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:59.690
 subtract and spend yourself from being pi that is 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:03.480
 every time your night a multiple of new 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:07.709
 x here we will have what would be and means 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:14.970
 more to add every time it hits where 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:18.120
 each varies in z 2 x 10 x 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:20.480
 by two if equal to 1 where sine of x 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.480
 would be 

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:25.310
 of a medium 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:28.920
 sine of x a half we observe that it would be 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:33.830
 approximately here and this angle will 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:36.680
 You can see it's my third 

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:39.230
 and now we know that again you can 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:41.990
 put here here we are interested now this 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:44.210
 that's a bit before reaching 5000 

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:48.310
 means a little before you get to first 

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:52.270
 there is a distance two pi 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:59.090
 would be more means 2 p 

00:03:52.270 --> 00:04:03.739
 - 2 - 4 so we have left 

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:06.040
 on the one hand x equal to more multiples of 

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:06.040
 two 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:10.030
 but let's also note that this one also 

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:13.090
 is 

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:16.480
 of the breast the same height pi thirds that 

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:18.040
 is this angle is the same as this one but 

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:20.890
 in the part 

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:24.130
 left that's less pi third already 

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:26.440
 we have less criteria and now yes 

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:29.940
 we are left with this one 

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:32.430
 there is a distance 2 p 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:34.639
 yes here we are 2 p 

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:37.599
 search 

00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:37.599
 this one here 

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:44.590
 before arriving at least 5 but then 

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:49.030
 you also have that is x equal to minus 

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:50.180
 and a half plus 2 capi where each variant 

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:53.840
 is 

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:55.340
 and these are the solutions of the 

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:57.490
 trigonometric equations that have 

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:57.490
 raised
