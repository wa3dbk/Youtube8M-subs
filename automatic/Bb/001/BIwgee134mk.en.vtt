hey everybody is chasing blaha here and
I<00:00:09.540> saw<00:00:09.750> someone<00:00:10.019> come<00:00:10.230> in<00:00:10.349> and<00:00:10.440> start<00:00:10.590> making

I saw someone come in and start making

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:12.740 
I saw someone come in and start making
some<00:00:11.070> comments<00:00:11.340> in<00:00:11.670> the<00:00:11.759> last<00:00:12.000> video<00:00:12.360> I<00:00:12.420> did

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
some comments in the last video I did

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:14.539 
some comments in the last video I did
and<00:00:12.990> it's<00:00:13.080> actually<00:00:13.469> a<00:00:13.769> comment<00:00:14.219> that<00:00:14.309> I<00:00:14.400> see

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
and it's actually a comment that I see

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:17.120 
and it's actually a comment that I see
fairly<00:00:14.910> often<00:00:15.089> online<00:00:15.560> it's<00:00:16.560> something<00:00:16.890> I<00:00:16.949> see

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
fairly often online it's something I see

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.340 
fairly often online it's something I see
people<00:00:17.369> talk<00:00:17.580> about<00:00:17.760> and<00:00:18.090> try<00:00:18.240> to<00:00:18.300> justify<00:00:18.840> and

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
people talk about and try to justify and

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.970 
people talk about and try to justify and
that<00:00:20.010> is<00:00:20.160> this<00:00:20.310> concept<00:00:21.180> that<00:00:21.980> calisthenics

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
that is this concept that calisthenics

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:24.259 
that is this concept that calisthenics
which<00:00:23.250> basically<00:00:23.580> means<00:00:23.880> just<00:00:24.060> doing

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
which basically means just doing

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:26.089 
which basically means just doing
bodyweight<00:00:24.840> movements<00:00:24.900> with<00:00:25.410> no<00:00:25.529> resistance

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
bodyweight movements with no resistance

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.870 
bodyweight movements with no resistance
at<00:00:26.220> various<00:00:26.580> types<00:00:26.849> is<00:00:27.320> in<00:00:28.320> some<00:00:28.740> way<00:00:28.980> more

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
at various types is in some way more

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.400 
at various types is in some way more
functional<00:00:30.300> or<00:00:30.779> gives<00:00:30.990> people<00:00:31.140> more

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
functional or gives people more

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.790 
functional or gives people more
real-world<00:00:32.309> strength<00:00:33.120> or<00:00:33.530> strength<00:00:34.530> on<00:00:34.710> the

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
real-world strength or strength on the

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.709 
real-world strength or strength on the
field<00:00:35.070> as<00:00:35.190> an<00:00:35.309> athlete<00:00:35.850> then<00:00:36.149> training<00:00:36.540> with

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
field as an athlete then training with

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:44.150 
field as an athlete then training with
free<00:00:36.989> weights<00:00:37.230> and<00:00:38.899> this<00:00:39.899> is<00:00:40.250> 2014<00:00:41.420> and<00:00:43.160> this

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
free weights and this is 2014 and this

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.650 
free weights and this is 2014 and this
idea<00:00:44.760> is<00:00:45.030> from<00:00:45.539> the<00:00:45.840> dark<00:00:47.000> ages<00:00:48.000> of<00:00:48.030> exercise

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
idea is from the dark ages of exercise

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.290 
idea is from the dark ages of exercise
science<00:00:48.870> and<00:00:49.230> sports<00:00:49.620> it<00:00:49.980> is<00:00:50.010> so<00:00:50.760> old<00:00:51.059> and

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
science and sports it is so old and

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.779 
science and sports it is so old and
outdated<00:00:51.739> that<00:00:52.739> if<00:00:52.890> you<00:00:53.039> were<00:00:53.160> to<00:00:53.280> go<00:00:53.399> say<00:00:53.610> this

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
outdated that if you were to go say this

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:55.610 
outdated that if you were to go say this
to<00:00:53.969> a<00:00:54.000> strength<00:00:54.390> and<00:00:54.539> conditioning<00:00:55.230> coach<00:00:55.289> he

to a strength and conditioning coach he

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.340 
to a strength and conditioning coach he
works<00:00:55.829> with<00:00:56.010> real<00:00:56.340> athletes<00:00:57.109> they<00:00:58.109> would

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
works with real athletes they would

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.369 
works with real athletes they would
laugh<00:00:58.559> their<00:00:58.829> ass<00:00:59.010> off<00:00:59.309> at<00:00:59.520> you<00:00:59.699> and<00:01:00.379> the

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
laugh their ass off at you and the

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.260 
laugh their ass off at you and the
difference<00:01:01.770> is<00:01:01.949> is<00:01:02.100> that<00:01:02.250> we<00:01:02.520> found<00:01:02.789> this<00:01:03.090> out

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
difference is is that we found this out

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.149 
difference is is that we found this out
in<00:01:03.329> the<00:01:03.570> real<00:01:03.750> world<00:01:04.019> because<00:01:04.290> in<00:01:04.650> American

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
in the real world because in American

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:06.950 
in the real world because in American
football<00:01:05.339> which<00:01:05.790> is<00:01:05.970> probably<00:01:06.510> just<00:01:06.810> about

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
football which is probably just about

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.050 
football which is probably just about

because of the amount of money involved
your<00:01:12.540> guys<00:01:12.750> have<00:01:13.170> to<00:01:13.380> be<00:01:13.560> the<00:01:13.740> best<00:01:13.950> of<00:01:14.130> the

used to be the myth that calisthenics

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:31.700 
used to be the myth that calisthenics
were<00:01:30.450> better<00:01:30.659> gave<00:01:30.900> you<00:01:30.990> more<00:01:31.170> functional

strength if the free weights slowed you
down<00:01:33.360> they<00:01:33.720> only<00:01:33.960> help<00:01:34.140> you<00:01:34.290> at<00:01:34.409> lifting

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
weights when the guys the teams who

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.050 
weights when the guys the teams who
started<00:01:37.770> doing<00:01:38.009> serious<00:01:38.520> strength<00:01:38.790> training

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
started doing serious strength training

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.819 
started doing serious strength training
with<00:01:39.270> free<00:01:39.479> weights<00:01:39.659> and<00:01:39.930> the<00:01:39.990> 70<00:01:40.439> started

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
with free weights and the 70 started

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:43.700 
with free weights and the 70 started
doing<00:01:41.070> this<00:01:41.220> they<00:01:41.909> were<00:01:42.320> hurting<00:01:43.320> the<00:01:43.680> other

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
doing this they were hurting the other

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.340 
doing this they were hurting the other
guys<00:01:44.180> when<00:01:45.180> that<00:01:45.390> the<00:01:45.570> lines<00:01:45.810> would<00:01:46.049> hit<00:01:46.229> each

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
guys when that the lines would hit each

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.620 
guys when that the lines would hit each

weightlifting versus the guys doing

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:51.530 
weightlifting versus the guys doing
calisthenics<00:01:50.610> they<00:01:50.820> were<00:01:50.939> putting<00:01:51.270> them<00:01:51.420> in

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
calisthenics they were putting them in

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.690 
calisthenics they were putting them in
the<00:01:51.630> fucking<00:01:51.960> hospital<00:01:52.649> they<00:01:53.369> were<00:01:53.430> hitting

the fucking hospital they were hitting

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.300 
the fucking hospital they were hitting
them<00:01:53.939> so<00:01:54.299> hard<00:01:54.630> because<00:01:55.470> they<00:01:55.590> weren't<00:01:55.979> strong

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
them so hard because they weren't strong

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:57.230 
them so hard because they weren't strong
enough<00:01:56.549> because<00:01:56.759> they<00:01:56.820> were<00:01:56.939> only<00:01:57.119> doing

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
enough because they were only doing

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.359 
enough because they were only doing
calisthenics<00:01:58.200> they<00:01:58.409> couldn't<00:01:58.770> take<00:01:58.920> a<00:01:58.979> hit

this<00:03:39.000> idea<00:03:39.239> is<00:03:39.690> just<00:03:39.900> bullshit<00:03:40.409> my<00:03:40.709> guys<00:03:40.949> would

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:41.609 
this idea is just bullshit my guys would

00:03:41.609 --> 00:03:44.059 
this idea is just bullshit my guys would
bury<00:03:42.569> your<00:03:42.959> team<00:03:43.199> and<00:03:43.530> your<00:03:43.680> guys<00:03:43.829> would<00:03:44.010> be

00:03:44.059 --> 00:03:44.069 
bury your team and your guys would be

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:46.729 
bury your team and your guys would be
leaving<00:03:44.310> the<00:03:44.519> field<00:03:44.699> on<00:03:44.849> stretchers<00:03:45.739> because

00:03:46.729 --> 00:03:46.739 
leaving the field on stretchers because

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:48.469 
leaving the field on stretchers because
they<00:03:46.889> would<00:03:47.129> not<00:03:47.310> be<00:03:47.370> able<00:03:47.819> to<00:03:47.909> take<00:03:48.120> the<00:03:48.269> hits

00:03:48.469 --> 00:03:48.479 
they would not be able to take the hits

00:03:48.479 --> 00:03:49.759 
they would not be able to take the hits
they<00:03:48.659> wouldn't<00:03:48.989> be<00:03:49.109> strong<00:03:49.409> enough<00:03:49.620> they

00:03:49.759 --> 00:03:49.769 
they wouldn't be strong enough they

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:51.500 
they wouldn't be strong enough they
would<00:03:49.919> be<00:03:50.040> a<00:03:50.069> bunch<00:03:50.340> of<00:03:50.430> weak<00:03:50.639> pussies<00:03:51.150> maybe

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:51.510 
would be a bunch of weak pussies maybe

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:52.879 
would be a bunch of weak pussies maybe
not<00:03:51.720> compared<00:03:52.079> to<00:03:52.139> the<00:03:52.199> average<00:03:52.319> oh<00:03:52.680> we

00:03:52.879 --> 00:03:52.889 
not compared to the average oh we

00:03:52.889 --> 00:03:54.500 
not compared to the average oh we
compared<00:03:53.250> to<00:03:53.340> other<00:03:53.489> football<00:03:53.909> rugby<00:03:54.150> players

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:54.510 
compared to other football rugby players

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:56.869 
compared to other football rugby players
that<00:03:54.750> would<00:03:54.930> be<00:03:55.079> they<00:03:55.979> wouldn't<00:03:56.370> even<00:03:56.519> be<00:03:56.760> able

00:03:56.869 --> 00:03:56.879 
that would be they wouldn't even be able

00:03:56.879 --> 00:03:58.399 
that would be they wouldn't even be able
to<00:03:57.090> take<00:03:57.299> the<00:03:57.449> hits<00:03:57.659> or<00:03:57.840> generate<00:03:58.169> enough

00:03:58.399 --> 00:03:58.409 
to take the hits or generate enough

00:03:58.409 --> 00:04:00.050 
to take the hits or generate enough
force<00:03:58.739> to<00:03:58.799> knock<00:03:58.949> my<00:03:59.250> guys<00:03:59.489> down<00:03:59.729> when<00:03:59.970> they

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:00.060 
force to knock my guys down when they

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:02.929 
force to knock my guys down when they
hit<00:04:00.209> them<00:04:00.859> it<00:04:01.859> doesn't<00:04:02.189> work<00:04:02.370> that<00:04:02.579> way<00:04:02.760> this

00:04:02.929 --> 00:04:02.939 
hit them it doesn't work that way this

00:04:02.939 --> 00:04:08.539 
hit them it doesn't work that way this
idea<00:04:03.239> is<00:04:04.019> so<00:04:04.680> outdated<00:04:05.329> and<00:04:06.949> not<00:04:07.949> up<00:04:08.129> to<00:04:08.250> speed

00:04:08.539 --> 00:04:08.549 
idea is so outdated and not up to speed

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:10.580 
idea is so outdated and not up to speed

found<00:04:14.849> to<00:04:15.060> not<00:04:15.209> work<00:04:15.540> so<00:04:16.500> why<00:04:16.799> people<00:04:17.250> are

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:17.400

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:18.989 
coming up with it again now and this

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:20.120 
coming up with it again now and this
idea<00:04:19.199> is

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:20.130 
idea is

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:22.820 
idea is
beyond<00:04:20.310> me<00:04:20.930> calisthenics<00:04:21.930> are<00:04:22.170> okay<00:04:22.440> to<00:04:22.500> build

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:22.830 
beyond me calisthenics are okay to build

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:24.320 
beyond me calisthenics are okay to build
strength<00:04:23.130> in<00:04:23.280> your<00:04:23.400> arms<00:04:23.760> and<00:04:23.940> delts<00:04:24.240> and

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:24.330 
strength in your arms and delts and

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:25.730 
strength in your arms and delts and
stuff<00:04:24.570> but<00:04:24.750> you<00:04:24.870> are<00:04:24.960> not<00:04:25.140> going<00:04:25.440> to<00:04:25.560> build

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:25.740 
stuff but you are not going to build

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:28.930 
stuff but you are not going to build
full-body<00:04:26.580> power<00:04:27.270> or<00:04:27.630> explosive<00:04:28.590> power

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:28.940 
full-body power or explosive power

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:31.850 
full-body power or explosive power
enough<00:04:29.940> so<00:04:30.150> to<00:04:30.210> really<00:04:31.110> be<00:04:31.350> what<00:04:31.710> you're

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:31.860 
enough so to really be what you're

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:33.710 
enough so to really be what you're
talking<00:04:32.130> about<00:04:32.160> functional<00:04:32.880> particularly<00:04:33.570> in

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:33.720 
talking about functional particularly in

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:36.530 
talking about functional particularly in
a<00:04:33.810> very<00:04:34.110> serious<00:04:34.590> sport<00:04:34.950> not<00:04:35.910> by<00:04:36.090> a<00:04:36.120> long<00:04:36.510> shot

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:36.540 
a very serious sport not by a long shot

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:39.170 
a very serious sport not by a long shot
so<00:04:37.170> when<00:04:37.860> people<00:04:38.070> say<00:04:38.370> this<00:04:38.580> I<00:04:38.760> don't<00:04:38.880> know

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:39.180 
so when people say this I don't know

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:40.480 
so when people say this I don't know
what<00:04:39.360> in<00:04:39.510> the<00:04:39.600> hell<00:04:39.630> they're<00:04:39.960> talking<00:04:39.990> about

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:40.490 
what in the hell they're talking about

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:42.590 
what in the hell they're talking about
other<00:04:41.490> than<00:04:41.520> I<00:04:41.730> do<00:04:41.790> agree<00:04:42.180> that<00:04:42.420> there<00:04:42.570> is

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:42.600 
other than I do agree that there is

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:44.090 
other than I do agree that there is
difference<00:04:43.050> between<00:04:43.080> clothes<00:04:43.590> chain<00:04:43.920> and

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:44.100 
difference between clothes chain and

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:45.680 
difference between clothes chain and
open<00:04:44.370> chain<00:04:44.550> movements<00:04:44.970> and<00:04:45.090> calisthenics

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:45.690 
open chain movements and calisthenics

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:48.320 
open chain movements and calisthenics
tend<00:04:45.900> to<00:04:45.990> be<00:04:46.520> good<00:04:47.520> because<00:04:47.880> they<00:04:47.970> move<00:04:48.180> your

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:48.330 
tend to be good because they move your

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:50.390 
tend to be good because they move your
body<00:04:48.510> through<00:04:48.870> space<00:04:49.110> but<00:04:49.620> squats<00:04:50.190> and

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:50.400 
body through space but squats and

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:52.100 
body through space but squats and
deadlifts<00:04:50.760> and<00:04:50.940> power<00:04:51.150> cleans<00:04:51.510> do<00:04:51.720> that<00:04:51.900> also

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:52.110 
deadlifts and power cleans do that also

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:54.640 
deadlifts and power cleans do that also
they<00:04:52.380> just<00:04:52.410> do<00:04:52.680> it<00:04:52.710> late<00:04:53.010> a<00:04:53.100> lot<00:04:53.340> more<00:04:54.090> weight

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:54.650 
they just do it late a lot more weight

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:56.990 
they just do it late a lot more weight
all<00:04:55.650> right<00:04:55.710> guys<00:04:55.950> that's<00:04:56.220> really<00:04:56.550> all<00:04:56.700> I<00:04:56.730> have
