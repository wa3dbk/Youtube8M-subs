00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
doesn't make that much of a difference

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.850 
doesn't make that much of a difference
particularly<00:00:53.219> because<00:00:53.579> he<00:00:54.210> went<00:00:54.329> to<00:00:54.420> one<00:00:54.629> and

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.639 
no one used him but maybe they will just
because<00:01:00.149> there<00:01:00.480> is<00:01:00.600> a<00:01:00.629> card<00:01:00.960> that<00:01:01.230> is<00:01:01.379> off<00:01:01.620> the

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.410 
opinion but I mean there aren't that
many<00:01:46.200> you<00:01:46.860> know<00:01:46.950> prominently<00:01:47.430> like<00:01:47.970> text<00:01:48.299> and

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
many you know prominently like text and

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:49.819 
many you know prominently like text and
running<00:01:48.659> right<00:01:48.930> now<00:01:48.960> but<00:01:49.200> I<00:01:49.470> mean<00:01:49.500> that<00:01:49.710> can

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
running right now but I mean that can

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:51.830 
running right now but I mean that can
change<00:01:49.979> obviously<00:01:50.220> they<00:01:50.729> have<00:01:50.939> a<00:01:50.970> Nutella

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
change obviously they have a Nutella

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.539 
change obviously they have a Nutella
nights<00:01:52.049> are<00:01:52.290> definitely<00:01:52.770> a<00:01:52.860> very<00:01:52.920> good<00:01:53.340> light

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
nights are definitely a very good light

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:56.090 
nights are definitely a very good light
deck<00:01:53.729> and<00:01:54.049> they<00:01:55.049> can<00:01:55.200> really<00:01:55.439> utilize<00:01:55.710> a

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
deck and they can really utilize a

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.950 
deck and they can really utilize a
double<00:01:56.610> honest<00:01:56.880> but<00:01:57.119> I<00:01:57.329> guess<00:01:57.719> we'll<00:01:57.869> see

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
double honest but I guess we'll see

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.209 
double honest but I guess we'll see
where<00:01:58.079> it<00:01:58.110> goes<00:01:58.170> from<00:01:58.290> here<00:01:58.439> I<00:01:58.799> like<00:01:58.950> I<00:01:58.979> said

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
where it goes from here I like I said

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:00.740 
where it goes from here I like I said
earlier<00:01:59.250> the<00:01:59.610> Goyo<00:01:59.850> Guardian<00:02:00.329> is<00:02:00.420> gonna<00:02:00.570> be<00:02:00.659> at

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
earlier the Goyo Guardian is gonna be at

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.690 
earlier the Goyo Guardian is gonna be at
two<00:02:00.930> but<00:02:01.110> it's<00:02:01.290> really<00:02:01.560> really<00:02:01.950> not<00:02:02.549> that

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
two but it's really really not that

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.030 
two but it's really really not that
great<00:02:03.079> however<00:02:04.079> we<00:02:04.259> also<00:02:04.290> have<00:02:04.590> dark<00:02:04.860> hole

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.950 
great however we also have dark hole
just<00:02:05.280> go<00:02:05.430> into<00:02:05.549> two<00:02:05.700> and<00:02:05.850> two<00:02:05.969> pretty<00:02:06.600> weird<00:02:06.780> in

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
just go into two and two pretty weird in

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.449 
just go into two and two pretty weird in
my<00:02:06.990> opinion<00:02:07.290> but<00:02:07.500> I'm<00:02:07.649> actually<00:02:07.829> really<00:02:08.160> down

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
my opinion but I'm actually really down

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:10.449 
my opinion but I'm actually really down
for<00:02:08.489> like<00:02:08.849> I'm<00:02:08.970> okay<00:02:09.300> with<00:02:09.450> two<00:02:09.599> dark<00:02:09.840> holes<00:02:10.080> I

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:10.459 
for like I'm okay with two dark holes I

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:12.619 
for like I'm okay with two dark holes I
can't<00:02:11.459> remember<00:02:11.730> the<00:02:11.970> last<00:02:12.120> time<00:02:12.330> that<00:02:12.450> they

00:02:12.619 --> 00:02:12.629 
can't remember the last time that they

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:13.880 
can't remember the last time that they
were<00:02:12.720> true<00:02:12.870> dark<00:02:13.050> holes<00:02:13.230> in<00:02:13.379> your<00:02:13.500> gear

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
were true dark holes in your gear

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:17.450 
were true dark holes in your gear
so<00:02:13.980> like<00:02:14.130> Jesus<00:02:14.580> Christ<00:02:14.819> but<00:02:15.569> um<00:02:16.190> that's<00:02:17.190> it

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:17.460
