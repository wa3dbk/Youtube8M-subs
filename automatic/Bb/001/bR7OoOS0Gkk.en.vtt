00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:06.960
 hello everyone today mike good weather 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:09.570
 in the general mood here, but I 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:12.719
 in encephalitis and why because with 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:15.269
 trees are jumping ticks therefore not 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:17.279
 forget about the right clothes and a means 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:17.970
 safety in construction and so 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:20.160
 go 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:24.890
 what today's will be devoted to 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:28.050
 video is dedicated to it will be how we 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:32.040
 we fall asleep vermiculite openings 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:34.770
 and then we lay plywood in principle 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:38.719
 just coping 1 so show 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:41.879
 tell and everything to the camcorder 

00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:48.180
 championship doing this scattering vermiculite 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:52.520
 rules and right at the beginning putting bundles for 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.520
 to be able to pull them dot 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:59.399
 then take for example the board or webs 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:02.550
 either plywood and put on the beam 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:05.480
 bead stretch lead and sweep away 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.480
 extra beams 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:28.130
 all the excess we sweep away ultimately 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:31.009
 beams must be clean swept min 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:35.720
 and here it should be all flush with us 

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:36.640
 And now the rubric is quite and riddles 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:40.490
 to guess 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:45.709
 say why i use data 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:47.899
 records who guesses that fellow so 

00:01:45.709 --> 00:01:50.420
 the little nuance is a sheet with the right 

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:54.250
 side of each sheet is a beam 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:58.130
 and how do we get and we can adjust 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:59.229
 measure the distance from the center to the edge 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:04.220
 beams 

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:07.819
 add 10 centimeters with clearance 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:09.769
 and cut as deep as we want 

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:12.110
 that the sheet came in general one 

00:02:09.769 --> 00:02:13.459
 little moment we put 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:16.160
 first sheet of plywood 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:18.650
 we should not immediately put the second we 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:19.220
 must first knit a scrap 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:21.270
 plywood 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:27.410
 which feast 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:27.410
 10 in the doorway rake you like it and 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:35.400
 using the press 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:37.440
 first sheet and then after when 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:39.890
 we fixed the trim we should 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:39.890
 I screw the screws 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:56.840
 Here is the finished version of what 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:03:00.140
 this is necessary when we pay the second sheet of y 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:04.120
 we get in this place the junction as if 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:06.050
 here they are two beams and here we have 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:08.300
 there is no support 

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:13.280
 fix the plywood on the first sheet and 

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:14.660
 screw then on the second we create 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:17.989
 joint stiffness 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:21.290
 and so when we will not walk with us 

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:22.850
 will be here load yourself for example 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:27.410
 one sheet per second sheet for output 

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:30.440
 evenly distributed after 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:33.800
 when we put the second sheet when we 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:38.320
 made markup we will punch when 

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:38.320
 help not lira with a pitch of 15 our nails 

00:03:55.879 --> 00:04:01.590
 Today I demonstrated how to 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:04.260
 put and fix two sheets 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:04.830
 well actually i did more showed 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:07.680
 only two 

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:11.060
 the next video I will show how to finish 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:14.790
 each sheet has a small piece of plywood 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:16.470
 In general, friends, this was me Stanislav 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:20.419
 thank you bye 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:20.419
 and soon until the weekend
