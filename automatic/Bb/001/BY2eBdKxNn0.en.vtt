what we want to do is just gather up the

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.889 
what we want to do is just gather up the
poles<00:02:05.579> in<00:02:05.819> the<00:02:05.879> center<00:02:06.569> like<00:02:07.170> so<00:02:08.869> and<00:02:09.869> then

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
poles in the center like so and then

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.199 
poles in the center like so and then
from<00:02:10.590> here<00:02:10.649> just<00:02:11.400> make<00:02:11.549> sure<00:02:11.579> that<00:02:11.940> the<00:02:12.030> end

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
from here just make sure that the end

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:14.539 
from here just make sure that the end
that<00:02:12.450> has<00:02:12.629> the<00:02:12.780> strap<00:02:13.049> attached<00:02:13.349> to<00:02:13.650> it<00:02:13.709> is<00:02:14.160> on

00:02:14.539 --> 00:02:14.549 
that has the strap attached to it is on

00:02:14.549 --> 00:02:18.080 
that has the strap attached to it is on
the<00:02:14.849> ground<00:02:15.090> so<00:02:15.870> if<00:02:15.930> we<00:02:16.049> do<00:02:16.200> that<00:02:16.610> just<00:02:17.610> pop<00:02:17.970> it

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:19.610 
the ground so if we do that just pop it
into<00:02:18.209> this<00:02:18.420> position<00:02:18.629> and<00:02:18.989> then<00:02:19.230> we<00:02:19.319> just<00:02:19.440> want

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
into this position and then we just want

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:21.650 
into this position and then we just want
to<00:02:19.680> take<00:02:19.860> the<00:02:20.010> pause<00:02:20.190> at<00:02:20.400> the<00:02:20.459> top<00:02:20.489> and<00:02:21.299> fold

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 
to take the pause at the top and fold

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:25.069 
to take the pause at the top and fold
them<00:02:21.959> in<00:02:22.230> underneath<00:02:22.950> like<00:02:23.430> so<00:02:23.760> and<00:02:24.599> your<00:02:24.720> CEO

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:25.079 
them in underneath like so and your CEO

00:02:25.079 --> 00:02:26.809 
them in underneath like so and your CEO
that<00:02:25.260> that<00:02:25.440> creates<00:02:25.799> two<00:02:26.099> loops<00:02:26.370> at<00:02:26.549> the<00:02:26.640> top

00:02:26.809 --> 00:02:26.819 
that that creates two loops at the top

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:29.479 
that that creates two loops at the top
which<00:02:27.599> then<00:02:27.810> just<00:02:28.079> fold<00:02:28.260> into<00:02:29.010> each<00:02:29.280> other

00:02:29.479 --> 00:02:29.489 
which then just fold into each other

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:33.470 
which then just fold into each other
