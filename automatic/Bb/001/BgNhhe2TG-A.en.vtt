that's<00:03:27.060> the<00:03:27.180> lack<00:03:27.329> of<00:03:27.359> bus<00:03:27.599> drivers<00:03:27.900> that<00:03:28.019> is

00:03:28.129 --> 00:03:28.139 
that's the lack of bus drivers that is

00:03:28.139 --> 00:03:30.229 
that's the lack of bus drivers that is
at<00:03:28.349> this<00:03:28.470> moment<00:03:28.530> in<00:03:28.829> time<00:03:28.859> so<00:03:29.849> because<00:03:30.209> of

00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:30.239 
at this moment in time so because of

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:32.420 
at this moment in time so because of
that<00:03:30.359> even<00:03:31.049> though<00:03:31.139> they<00:03:31.260> are<00:03:31.349> bus<00:03:31.530> available

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.430 
that even though they are bus available

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:34.490 
that even though they are bus available
but<00:03:33.180> if<00:03:33.389> they're<00:03:33.629> not<00:03:33.660> in<00:03:33.840> our<00:03:33.930> bus<00:03:34.049> drivers<00:03:34.379> we

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500 
but if they're not in our bus drivers we

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:36.740 
but if they're not in our bus drivers we
can't<00:03:34.739> move<00:03:34.910> but<00:03:35.910> the<00:03:36.000> other<00:03:36.150> issue<00:03:36.389> is<00:03:36.569> that

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:36.750 
can't move but the other issue is that

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:39.439 
can't move but the other issue is that
because<00:03:37.109> people<00:03:37.590> still<00:03:37.769> take<00:03:37.980> cars<00:03:38.329> so<00:03:39.329> the

00:03:39.439 --> 00:03:39.449 
because people still take cars so the

00:03:39.449 --> 00:03:41.750 
because people still take cars so the
buses<00:03:39.720> are<00:03:39.750> stuck<00:03:40.079> in<00:03:40.230> traffic<00:03:40.470> jams<00:03:40.760> so

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:41.760 
buses are stuck in traffic jams so

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:43.670 
buses are stuck in traffic jams so
that's<00:03:42.150> why<00:03:42.359> buses<00:03:42.810> and<00:03:43.109> we<00:03:43.230> know<00:03:43.379> and<00:03:43.590> we

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:43.680 
that's why buses and we know and we

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:46.129 
that's why buses and we know and we
accept<00:03:43.919> it<00:03:44.069> they're<00:03:44.639> not<00:03:44.760> always<00:03:44.910> on<00:03:45.150> time<00:03:45.299> our

00:03:46.129 --> 00:03:46.139 
accept it they're not always on time our

00:03:46.139 --> 00:03:47.599 
accept it they're not always on time our
hope<00:03:46.470> is<00:03:46.590> that<00:03:46.620> when<00:03:46.859> you<00:03:46.980> put<00:03:47.129> more<00:03:47.280> buses<00:03:47.519> on

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:47.609 
hope is that when you put more buses on

00:03:47.609 --> 00:03:49.670 
hope is that when you put more buses on
the<00:03:47.699> road<00:03:47.879> that<00:03:48.750> the<00:03:48.840> public<00:03:49.139> will<00:03:49.199> see<00:03:49.440> that

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:49.680 
the road that the public will see that

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:51.500 
the road that the public will see that
there's<00:03:49.859> more<00:03:50.010> availability<00:03:50.370> of<00:03:50.639> buses<00:03:50.940> then

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:51.510 
there's more availability of buses then

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:52.849 
there's more availability of buses then
they'll<00:03:51.690> leave<00:03:51.840> the<00:03:51.870> class<00:03:52.139> again<00:03:52.500> at<00:03:52.650> home

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:52.859 
they'll leave the class again at home

00:03:52.859 --> 00:03:54.860 
they'll leave the class again at home
and<00:03:53.069> take<00:03:53.400> the<00:03:53.489> bus<00:03:53.639> or<00:03:53.879> even<00:03:54.090> real<00:03:54.239> so<00:03:54.690> that

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:54.870 
and take the bus or even real so that

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:58.000
