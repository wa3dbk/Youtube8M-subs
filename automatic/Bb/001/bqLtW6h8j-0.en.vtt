think that I put the the pill speed on a

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:03.959 
think that I put the the pill speed on a
little<00:02:01.119> bit<00:02:01.210> slower<00:02:01.630> it's<00:02:02.259> been<00:02:02.409> a<00:02:02.439> long<00:02:02.969> long

00:02:03.959 --> 00:02:03.969 
little bit slower it's been a long long

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:06.460 
time since I played dr. Mario I had the

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:07.919 
time since I played dr. Mario I had the

00:02:07.919 --> 00:02:07.929 
original on the NES was actually

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:09.630 
original on the NES was actually

love<00:02:14.110> with<00:02:14.230> this<00:02:14.350> game<00:02:14.620> way<00:02:15.370> back<00:02:15.580> when<00:02:15.790> and

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:15.940 
love with this game way back when and

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:17.040 
love with this game way back when and
this<00:02:16.030> is<00:02:16.090> the<00:02:16.330> first<00:02:16.360> time<00:02:16.720> I've<00:02:16.900> actually

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:17.050 
this is the first time I've actually

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:19.350 
this is the first time I've actually
played<00:02:17.530> dr.<00:02:18.490> Mario<00:02:18.790> in

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.360 
played dr. Mario in

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:21.120 
played dr. Mario in
I<00:02:19.390> guess<00:02:19.750> 20<00:02:20.020> years<00:02:20.440> which<00:02:20.710> is<00:02:20.740> kind<00:02:21.100> of

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:21.130 
I guess 20 years which is kind of

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:22.680 
I guess 20 years which is kind of
terrifying<00:02:21.550> to<00:02:21.700> think<00:02:21.730> about<00:02:22.060> so<00:02:22.510> I'm<00:02:22.570> going

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:22.690

to step away you guys can listen to the

00:02:24.010 --> 00:04:23.540
