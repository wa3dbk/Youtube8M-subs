00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
sound you know I've tried to restrain

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.800 
sound you know I've tried to restrain
myself<00:01:31.139> and<00:01:31.590> not<00:01:31.679> not<00:01:32.310> like<00:01:32.609> lab<00:01:33.359> and<00:01:33.659> tell

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
myself and not not like lab and tell

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.879 
myself and not not like lab and tell
people<00:01:33.840> about<00:01:34.289> it<00:01:34.939> but<00:01:35.939> yeah<00:01:36.149> it's<00:01:36.389> um<00:01:36.689> I<00:01:37.049> think

00:01:37.879 --> 00:01:37.889 
people about it but yeah it's um I think

00:01:37.889 --> 00:01:40.209 
people about it but yeah it's um I think
engineers<00:01:38.369> are<00:01:38.459> gonna<00:01:38.549> be<00:01:38.700> really<00:01:38.939> impressive

00:01:40.209 --> 00:01:40.219 
engineers are gonna be really impressive

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:43.279 
engineers are gonna be really impressive
because<00:01:41.270> most<00:01:42.270> engineers<00:01:42.719> wouldn't<00:01:43.139> say

00:01:43.279 --> 00:01:43.289 
because most engineers wouldn't say

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:45.499 
because most engineers wouldn't say
let's<00:01:43.590> yeah<00:01:43.889> let's<00:01:44.280> do<00:01:44.670> a<00:01:44.700> direct<00:01:45.060> line<00:01:45.240> on<00:01:45.420> the

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
let's yeah let's do a direct line on the

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:48.469 
let's yeah let's do a direct line on the
acoustic<00:01:45.749> too<00:01:46.759> but<00:01:47.759> I<00:01:47.969> know<00:01:48.029> I'll<00:01:48.450> be

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
acoustic too but I know I'll be

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.660 
acoustic too but I know I'll be
suggesting<00:01:49.200> it<00:01:49.319> I'll<00:01:49.950> be<00:01:50.069> saying<00:01:50.310> that's<00:01:50.429> you

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
suggesting it I'll be saying that's you

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.419 
suggesting it I'll be saying that's you
know<00:01:50.729> that's<00:01:51.289> yeah<00:01:52.289> here's<00:01:52.590> your<00:01:52.770> here's<00:01:53.310> your

00:01:53.419 --> 00:01:53.429 
know that's yeah here's your here's your

00:01:53.429 --> 00:01:57.410 
know that's yeah here's your here's your
mic<00:01:53.729> setting<00:01:54.149> button<00:01:54.590> do<00:01:55.590> a<00:01:55.619> DI<00:01:55.889> -<00:01:56.069> and<00:01:56.490> that's

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
mic setting button do a DI - and that's

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.019 
mic setting button do a DI - and that's
experiment<00:01:58.020> yeah<00:01:58.439> it<00:01:59.069> sounds<00:01:59.310> really<00:01:59.340> natural

00:02:00.019 --> 00:02:00.029 
experiment yeah it sounds really natural

00:02:00.029 --> 00:02:04.370 
experiment yeah it sounds really natural
and<00:02:00.270> full<00:02:00.810> it's<00:02:01.349> a<00:02:02.090> it<00:02:03.090> doesn't<00:02:03.450> sound<00:02:03.659> it

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
and full it's a it doesn't sound it

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.260 
and full it's a it doesn't sound it
doesn't<00:02:04.619> sound<00:02:04.770> processed<00:02:05.399> to<00:02:05.759> sound<00:02:06.149> like

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
doesn't sound processed to sound like

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:06.890 
doesn't sound processed to sound like
it's

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:06.900 
it's

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:10.249 
it's
I<00:02:07.759> think<00:02:08.759> it's<00:02:08.880> it's<00:02:09.210> like<00:02:09.390> it's<00:02:09.540> trying<00:02:09.750> to<00:02:10.080> be

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
I think it's it's like it's trying to be

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:13.400 
I think it's it's like it's trying to be
something<00:02:10.560> it<00:02:10.890> just<00:02:10.920> is
