00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:06.989 
to apply it to this one photo and get

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:08.869 
to apply it to this one photo and get
the<00:03:07.109> printing<00:03:07.470> process<00:03:07.709> started<00:03:08.310> now<00:03:08.700> this<00:03:08.819> is

00:03:08.869 --> 00:03:08.879 
the printing process started now this is

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:10.339 
the printing process started now this is
going<00:03:09.060> to<00:03:09.180> take<00:03:09.329> a<00:03:09.390> little<00:03:09.659> bit<00:03:09.840> over<00:03:10.019> a<00:03:10.049> minute

00:03:10.339 --> 00:03:10.349 
going to take a little bit over a minute

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:12.410 
going to take a little bit over a minute
to<00:03:10.440> print<00:03:10.709> out<00:03:10.829> this<00:03:11.220> will<00:03:11.489> actually<00:03:11.700> print<00:03:12.030> up

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
to print out this will actually print up

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:14.660 
to print out this will actually print up
to<00:03:12.720> 39<00:03:13.140> seconds<00:03:13.799> as<00:03:13.950> far<00:03:14.159> as<00:03:14.280> the<00:03:14.400> speed<00:03:14.640> goes

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:14.670 
to 39 seconds as far as the speed goes

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:16.819 
to 39 seconds as far as the speed goes
so<00:03:15.060> it<00:03:15.180> quite<00:03:15.510> a<00:03:15.540> fast<00:03:15.870> printer<00:03:16.230> typically

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:16.829 
so it quite a fast printer typically

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:18.170 
so it quite a fast printer typically
speaking<00:03:16.920> i<00:03:17.220> find<00:03:17.489> the<00:03:17.579> prints<00:03:17.849> are<00:03:17.940> about<00:03:18.090> a

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
speaking i find the prints are about a

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:19.339 
speaking i find the prints are about a
minute<00:03:18.510> just<00:03:18.690> a<00:03:18.780> little<00:03:18.930> bit<00:03:19.049> over<00:03:19.169> a<00:03:19.200> minute

00:03:19.339 --> 00:03:19.349 
minute just a little bit over a minute

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:21.949 
minute just a little bit over a minute
which<00:03:19.739> is<00:03:19.889> still<00:03:20.099> plenty<00:03:20.700> fast<00:03:21.150> now<00:03:21.780> one<00:03:21.930> thing

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:21.959 
which is still plenty fast now one thing

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:23.270 
which is still plenty fast now one thing
