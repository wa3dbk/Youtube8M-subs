that kind of an amp draw before off of
one<00:01:38.130> double-a<00:01:38.970> battery<00:01:39.450> so<00:01:39.630> if<00:01:39.720> you<00:01:39.810> do<00:01:39.990> the

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
one double-a battery so if you do the

but<00:01:51.119> it<00:01:51.689> looks<00:01:52.049> good<00:01:52.290> to<00:01:52.530> me<00:01:52.710> so<00:01:53.040> I<00:01:53.070> thought<00:01:53.340> I

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
but it looks good to me so I thought I

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:56.690 
but it looks good to me so I thought I
would<00:01:53.520> post<00:01:53.939> this<00:01:54.299> and<00:01:54.570> show<00:01:55.229> the<00:01:55.439> circuit<00:01:56.009> and

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
would post this and show the circuit and

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.429 
would post this and show the circuit and
what<00:01:57.600> this<00:01:57.810> is<00:01:58.079> is<00:01:58.409> like<00:01:58.619> I<00:01:58.799> say<00:01:59.009> it's<00:01:59.280> a

do some more testing but I'm going to

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:26.690 
do some more testing but I'm going to
crank<00:03:25.470> this<00:03:25.680> up<00:03:25.950> you'll<00:03:26.130> see<00:03:26.310> this<00:03:26.430> get<00:03:26.670> a

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:26.700 
crank this up you'll see this get a

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:30.229 
crank this up you'll see this get a
little<00:03:26.880> bit<00:03:27.000> brighter<00:03:27.209> here<00:03:28.489> and<00:03:29.489> that's<00:03:30.060> the

little bit brighter here and that's the

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:34.129 
little bit brighter here and that's the
top<00:03:30.480> end<00:03:30.810> at<00:03:31.019> about<00:03:31.319> 87<00:03:32.630> millions<00:03:33.630> and<00:03:34.019> that's

00:03:34.129 --> 00:03:34.139 
top end at about 87 millions and that's

00:03:34.139 --> 00:03:36.860 
top end at about 87 millions and that's
putting<00:03:34.410> out<00:03:34.530> quite<00:03:34.799> a<00:03:34.829> bit<00:03:35.040> of<00:03:35.130> light<00:03:35.870> that

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870 
putting out quite a bit of light that

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:40.370 
putting out quite a bit of light that
goes<00:03:37.109> down<00:03:37.290> to<00:03:37.349> the<00:03:37.560> 50<00:03:38.750> and<00:03:39.750> that<00:03:39.870> goes<00:03:40.139> up<00:03:40.349> to

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:40.380 
goes down to the 50 and that goes up to

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:43.879 
goes down to the 50 and that goes up to
the<00:03:40.849> 87<00:03:41.849> milliamps<00:03:42.510> but<00:03:42.569> that's<00:03:43.260> pretty<00:03:43.590> good

00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:43.889 
the 87 milliamps but that's pretty good

00:03:43.889 --> 00:03:47.240 
the 87 milliamps but that's pretty good
pretty<00:03:44.489> good<00:03:44.639> run<00:03:45.599> right<00:03:45.870> there<00:03:46.109> and<00:03:46.980> I'm

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.250 
pretty good run right there and I'm

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:48.770

Oh Maria's death that I use instead of a
Clinton<00:04:11.819> geometers<00:04:12.419> I<00:04:12.599> put<00:04:13.380> that<00:04:13.560> rheostat

00:04:14.059 --> 00:04:14.069 
Clinton geometers I put that rheostat

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:16.129 
Clinton geometers I put that rheostat
right<00:04:14.280> here<00:04:14.549> on<00:04:14.669> the<00:04:14.790> power<00:04:15.000> rail<00:04:15.299> and<00:04:16.109> that

00:04:16.129 --> 00:04:16.139 
right here on the power rail and that

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:18.500 
right here on the power rail and that
lets<00:04:16.470> me<00:04:16.590> control<00:04:17.039> lots<00:04:17.370> of<00:04:17.549> things<00:04:17.729> just<00:04:18.150> with

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:18.510 
lets me control lots of things just with

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:21.379 
lets me control lots of things just with
that<00:04:18.720> one<00:04:18.989> little<00:04:19.200> device<00:04:19.560> right<00:04:19.769> there<00:04:20.389> but

00:04:21.379 --> 00:04:21.389 
that one little device right there but

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:22.880 
that one little device right there but
that's<00:04:21.900> the<00:04:22.109> last<00:04:22.229> thing<00:04:22.500> I've<00:04:22.620> been<00:04:22.650> working

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:22.890 
that's the last thing I've been working

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:25.370 
that's the last thing I've been working
on<00:04:23.250> I<00:04:23.280> call<00:04:23.669> this<00:04:23.820> the<00:04:23.880> Kazaam<00:04:24.479> light<00:04:24.870> because

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:25.380 
on I call this the Kazaam light because

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:26.879 
on I call this the Kazaam light because
Kazaam<00:04:25.890> was<00:04:26.099> the<00:04:26.250> one<00:04:26.430> that

00:04:26.879 --> 00:04:26.889 
Kazaam was the one that

Kazaam was the one that
