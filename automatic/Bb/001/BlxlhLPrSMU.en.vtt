00:01:29.599 --> 00:01:29.609 
i'm coming up to i think there's about

00:01:29.609 --> 00:01:36.099 
i'm coming up to i think there's about
four<00:01:30.119> more<00:01:31.820> one<00:01:32.820> more<00:01:34.159> dream<00:01:35.159> up<00:01:35.369> two<00:01:35.549> more

00:01:36.099 --> 00:01:36.109

three<00:01:37.109> more<00:01:38.090> for<00:01:39.090> more<00:01:39.420> I<00:01:39.659> think<00:01:40.289> that<00:01:40.500> was<00:01:40.679> the

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
three more for more I think that was the

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.099 
three more for more I think that was the
final<00:01:41.310> one<00:01:41.520> I<00:01:41.759> actually<00:01:42.210> just<00:01:42.539> run<00:01:42.750> around<00:01:42.869> I

00:01:43.099 --> 00:01:43.109 
final one I actually just run around I

00:01:43.109 --> 00:01:44.389 
final one I actually just run around I
still<00:01:43.289> has<00:01:43.409> an<00:01:43.530> extra<00:01:43.859> time<00:01:44.070> because<00:01:44.100> I

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
still has an extra time because I

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:47.029 
still has an extra time because I
started<00:01:44.789> on<00:01:44.880> 15<00:01:45.359> minutes<00:01:45.719> I<00:01:45.990> still<00:01:46.710> have<00:01:46.859> about
