00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:14.430
 Two years ago I moved to the desert 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:17.070
 began to leave some spots on the 

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:19.050
 skin in the summer every time I went to 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:22.380
 play tennis or something like that they started me 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:26.060
 horrible wicks and I went crazy because 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.060
 way it seems cantinflas 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.669
 wrinkles began to come out the weather is 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.770
 completely different from cities 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:37.500
 so I had to start getting 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:40.100
 tricks and ways to take care of my skin better 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.100

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.629

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:50.140

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:53.199
 the times because I really appeared 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:55.449

00:00:53.199 --> 00:00:56.710
 cream that is special for spots all 

00:00:55.449 --> 00:00:58.930

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:00.280
 cream but it's literally if I took off 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:01.989
