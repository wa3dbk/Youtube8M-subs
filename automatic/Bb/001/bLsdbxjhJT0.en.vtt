00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:29.660 
chlorine in the pool but it didn't

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:31.750 
chlorine in the pool but it didn't
really<00:00:29.720> work<00:00:29.869> that<00:00:30.140> way<00:00:30.289> as<00:00:30.830> you<00:00:31.490> can<00:00:31.610> tell

I've<00:00:31.880> got<00:00:32.029> some<00:00:32.180> linked<00:00:32.390> blonde<00:00:32.750> down<00:00:33.020> here

00:00:33.459 --> 00:00:33.469 
I've got some linked blonde down here

00:00:33.469 --> 00:00:35.020 
I've got some linked blonde down here
definitely<00:00:33.920> need<00:00:34.250> to<00:00:34.340> do<00:00:34.430> my<00:00:34.520> nails<00:00:34.579> but

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:35.030 
definitely need to do my nails but

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:36.760

hopefully<00:00:35.870> a<00:00:35.899> different<00:00:36.140> color<00:00:36.289> one<00:00:36.559> that

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:36.770 
hopefully a different color one that

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:39.100 
hopefully a different color one that
will<00:00:36.920> match<00:00:37.340> my<00:00:37.670> hair<00:00:37.940> afterwards<00:00:38.420> which<00:00:38.780> I'm
