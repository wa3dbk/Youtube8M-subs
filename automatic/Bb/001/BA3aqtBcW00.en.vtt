00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:07.529
 here we are good lesson 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:10.559
 we start with forbidden games where 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:13.200
 we have to harp the same the third 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:16.139
 the second is the first string as from 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:20.760
 score starting from the seventh fee 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:25.740
 on the first rope positioning then 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:29.390
 the ring finger putting the medium ready a 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:33.899
 crush the first string to the fifth e 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:37.320
 the index ready to crush instead the 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:43.890
 first rope to the third one starts with le 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:46.970
 first two bars that 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:52.280
 they see practically a repeated arpeggio 

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:52.280
 of fullbacks this way 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:59.680
 we basically have to do three 

00:00:56.809 --> 00:00:59.680
 fullbacks 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:11.119
 so only the first one is played 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:16.890
 sixth string three fullbacks with the ring finger 

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:22.190
 resting on the first string at the seventh 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:25.619
 key and park the first eighth 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:27.909
 playing the sixth and the first string 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:32.920
 together 

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:35.759
 the second datum of the cellar the second 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:35.759
 string in the guitar 

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:45.090
 of the third eighth of the third the third 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:47.610
 guitar string and the triplet is 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:52.820
 completed and must be repeated for 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:52.820
 three bikes and this is the first line 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:02:03.549
 ok to which is added I said the second 

00:01:58.689 --> 00:02:07.330
 which is formed of the triplet on the seventh 

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:10.780
 tusk in the triplet on the fifth is one 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:14.080
 a third triplet is the first triplet 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:16.959
 sees the sixth string played but for le 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:18.640
 others are supported on the first 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:20.189
 the second the third thing with lo 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:25.079
 shift 

00:02:20.189 --> 00:02:25.079
 in this second matures 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:31.099
 that joined the first becomes 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:44.840
 the third measure instead we have one 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:48.740
 triplet starting from the third key in 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:51.739
 this case we are with index one 

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:55.580
 triplet that sees the first string 

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:59.959
 crushed to the second and one instead the 

00:02:55.580 --> 00:03:03.500
 the first string I always have the pattern 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:07.760
 I always rhythmic that is only the 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:10.110
 first tavo sees played by sixth with is 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:13.580
 always true 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:13.580
 in this bomb 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:22.110
 let's see the three bars together and 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:22.110
 become 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:40.180
 we practically moved the hand from 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:43.150
 seventh to fifth to third 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:45.909
 then he says he retreats to the second 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:48.480
 and then leaves the agreement free this is 

00:03:45.909 --> 00:03:48.480
 only to notes 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:58.150
 the fourth measure instead sixth first 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:04:01.040
 ford absent 0 fight 

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:04.430
 then a triplet in which we crush to 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:07.790
 third with the index and the triplet and these 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:11.200
 the seventh makes it I prefer 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:11.200
 work this way 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:19.459
 I repeat empty with the sixth assembly 

00:04:20.139 --> 00:04:31.900
 the third and then 7 always with an attitude 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:36.629
 arrives responds to a third string then 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:36.629
 everything becomes from the first beat 

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:53.020
 we arrived at the fourth we add 

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:56.070
 also the fifth line that one sees 

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:58.840
 move of the whole hand to the 

00:04:56.070 --> 00:05:03.040
 twelfth key ie rate with which 

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:05.460
 the future in this way the neighbor propose 

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:09.690
 so it happens 

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:13.970
 and we have to use the ring finger on 12 

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:16.889
 the average on the 10 and the index on the garden 

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:19.560
 like before when we had placed the 

00:05:16.889 --> 00:05:22.949
 seventh hand so it's third so now 

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:24.419
 let's leave twelfth of the secretary i 

00:05:22.949 --> 00:05:29.120
 rates are the closest with i 

00:05:24.419 --> 00:05:29.120
 details that always the same way 

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:38.870
 even if there is a joke to be made first 

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:43.520
 only of the 12th key then three 

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:47.110
 high decided cups of a key itself 

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:47.110
 themes rhythm for this no 

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:53.639
 which combined with the sixth bar becomes 

00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:58.740
 I'll do it 

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:13.130
 see we are the fifth and sixth 

00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:13.130
 joke twelfth fret three fullbacks 

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:21.870
 then again with the sexta a triplet 12 

00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:29.450
 1 to 10 a fight from the first bar 

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:29.450
 becomes the seventh initial position 

00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:39.170
 12 

00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:45.130
 we have arrived at the meaning
