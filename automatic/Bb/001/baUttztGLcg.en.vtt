00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.750
 hello to all german to all and nothing 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:06.089
 we are one more day of russell coutts and 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:09.350
 extreme another day of curiosities today is 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:09.350
 will focus on youtube 

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:20.600
 if today we are going to talk specifically about 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:22.490
 youtube way of trivia that 

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:24.380
 they write and strange things do not appear 

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:25.640
 mentions both those who are hurt 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:27.290
 hours like a couple of her or three that have 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:28.910
 stopped being active but they are very 

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:31.490
 curious because what happens is that 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:33.290
 this will be remodeled by deactivating a 

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:35.480
 active in another and so it is worth a little 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:36.980
 almost two hours on youtube so 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:40.790
 as we explained each worked 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:42.260
 fibonacci was a man who invented a 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:44.210
 fibonacci sequence vouchers the 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:47.330
 fibonacci sequence is characterized 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:50.269
 because the number the number x is the 

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:52.280
 double the previous just number and this 

00:00:50.269 --> 00:00:54.559
 gives rise to the golden ratio in certain 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:56.870
 way and the fibonacci spiral 

00:00:54.559 --> 00:01:00.470
 so if you put fibonacci in 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:02.059
 youtube or leave all the date appointment tín 

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:06.170
 tín tín forming the fibonacci spiral 

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:08.870
 and doing the same 1,248 wise men what 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:10.460
 we are increasing like this and it looks super cool 

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:12.050
 of the teacher for the level of people who 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:13.280
 like the composition if you want to put in 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:14.930
 the world the video something like that you have to 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:16.880
 always keep in mind these rules the 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:18.530
 fibonacci rule because if they make up of 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:20.540
 this way will always be 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:23.930
 petra a little fragrance for those of star 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:28.400
 wars on youtube if you write use of force 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:30.710
 look uses strength look voucher sale 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:34.180
 a little weird the screen and it starts to 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:34.180
 move as if you with your strength 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:53.899
 more little things then if the star command 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:56.090
 wars let's talk about starter and if

 videos leave as teleported

 in 1980 during a video is suddenly worth 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:21.659
 a mini game is activated 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:24.030
 you have four cannons and it's firing 

00:02:21.659 --> 00:02:32.310
 the little balls that are getting closer and know 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:33.810

 of youtube as if it were valuable old 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:45.840

 when you are in colors yes yes yes 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:50.099
 typical of the adventures of the year catapun 

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:51.629
 of the old computer track 

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:53.220
 old ancient these habits has been 

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:56.129
 curious very curious we no longer have one 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:58.200
 that can be partly by fashion 

00:02:56.129 --> 00:03:00.180
 of the harlem if we all know that it 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:03.329
 leave the scientist video of the project 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:05.819
 the u2 terrorists came out dancing 

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:10.200
 giving everything and suddenly everything comes together and 

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:11.939
 begins to go to the chaos with the part of 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:14.459
 horse so strong that one stayed 

00:03:11.939 --> 00:03:17.219
 back and also set it to 6 and you put 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:18.870
 that's worth it, they came out logical and all the 

00:03:17.219 --> 00:03:20.879
 videos the words of laughter and very well 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:22.200
 with the winds it will consist of looking 

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:25.370
 also in essence at the beginning only 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:25.370
 the wolf of youtube began 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:38.350
 and start 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:51.310
 visitor 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:02.879
 and apart as a curiosity also appears 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:05.250
 as a search when by letting you 

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:06.900
 find that outline of the people meeting 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:10.230
 in harlem safety and half men it was done 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:12.720
 all the first videos and we're already 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:14.250
 now to ones that have disabled is worth 

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:15.900
 several that have disabled resting more 

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:18.359
 for example there was one very curious 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:20.040
 you all have in mind the 

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:21.840
 circulito downloading from youtube vale 

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:23.790
 that are some balls of explicit of 

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:26.820
 every turn before if you give the 

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:28.650
 side and above that moved and it 

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:30.630
 turn a snake began to play 

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:34.410
 to the snake game a play to 

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:36.120
 snail on youtube became saying 

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:37.320
 we look for very heavy videos that you took 

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:39.690
 in charging to give you this type is 

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:42.210
 perfect that happens to you with the last 

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:43.620
 google + supported update 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:45.270
 for one side and for others go for 

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:46.889
 frame to frame is worth going back 

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:49.449
 useful that everyone do all the 

00:04:46.889 --> 00:04:52.389
 videos and have disabled the snake 

00:04:49.449 --> 00:04:54.039
 very bad very bad poop poop poop other 

00:04:52.389 --> 00:04:56.050
 superco far away for god who also 

00:04:54.039 --> 00:04:59.349
 have deactivated in exquisite I wrote 

00:04:56.050 --> 00:05:02.520
 makes youtube ponys or bonis that came out 

00:04:59.349 --> 00:05:02.520
 others 

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:13.250
 this blows me complaint to me 

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:13.250
 personally I do not know 

00:05:20.689 --> 00:05:26.059
 another very curious exquisite wrote 

00:05:23.199 --> 00:05:29.389
 1,337 that would be all the comments 

00:05:26.059 --> 00:05:31.129
 under the language in the language this 

00:05:29.389 --> 00:05:33.589
 the vowels are replaced by numbers is 

00:05:31.129 --> 00:05:36.949
 it's just a 4 

00:05:33.589 --> 00:05:40.069
 it's a 3 it's all been to the 20 the law 

00:05:36.949 --> 00:05:41.779
 it's a good thing all 1 like that and it says it was 

00:05:40.069 --> 00:05:46.189
 super 4 or it seems they are hackers 

00:05:41.779 --> 00:05:49.959
 dividing suddenly when I wanted that 

00:05:46.189 --> 00:05:49.959
 they left you because there is super in sight 

00:05:50.269 --> 00:06:02.209
 but very funny, well, before us 

00:06:00.619 --> 00:06:04.639
 there was much more they saw for ages and 

00:06:02.209 --> 00:06:07.099
 write for example snow and not something like that 

00:06:04.639 --> 00:06:09.019
 snowing in English you went out of yes 

00:06:07.099 --> 00:06:10.489
 but they are things that took away briefly 

00:06:09.019 --> 00:06:12.679
 for this they have remained in time 

00:06:10.489 --> 00:06:14.479
 and we can continue to see this that 

00:06:12.679 --> 00:06:16.639
 We have quoted that I do not think it will leave us 

00:06:14.479 --> 00:06:18.949
 If you have a good time, we'll see each other and if 

00:06:16.639 --> 00:06:20.809
 catapun and in our time there were some 

00:06:18.949 --> 00:06:23.979
 so real that they comment on the retinas 

00:06:20.809 --> 00:06:23.979
 which ones do you like the most? 

00:06:27.069 --> 00:06:31.840
 the next week so 

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:50.710
 it does not control
