in<00:00:37.890> this<00:00:38.370> game<00:00:38.550> right<00:00:38.940> now<00:00:38.969> and<00:00:39.360> honestly<00:00:39.600> in

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
in this game right now and honestly in

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:41.540 
in this game right now and honestly in
my<00:00:39.930> opinion<00:00:40.050> I<00:00:40.530> think<00:00:40.559> o<00:00:40.860> P<00:00:41.039> matrix<00:00:41.190> is

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
my opinion I think o P matrix is

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.959 
my opinion I think o P matrix is
probably<00:00:42.120> I<00:00:42.679> don't<00:00:43.679> know<00:00:43.829> at<00:00:44.010> least<00:00:44.039> top<00:00:44.579> three

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
probably I don't know at least top three

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:46.910 
probably I don't know at least top three
in<00:00:45.149> this<00:00:45.300> game<00:00:45.510> right<00:00:45.719> now<00:00:45.780> he's<00:00:46.559> up<00:00:46.769> there

central legal all the Opie um members
are<00:00:52.589> coincidentally<00:00:53.429> like<00:00:53.609> the<00:00:53.730> best<00:00:53.909> players

00:00:54.169 --> 00:00:54.179

in the game I mean I'm just saying
that's<00:00:56.489> probably<00:00:56.579> a<00:00:56.999> reason<00:00:57.359> why<00:00:57.510> Opie<00:00:58.079> is<00:00:58.260> the

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
that's probably a reason why Opie is the

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.559 
that's probably a reason why Opie is the
best<00:00:58.620> Call<00:00:59.219> of<00:00:59.249> Duty<00:00:59.519> pub<00:00:59.729> stomping<00:01:00.149> clan<00:01:00.359> in
