00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:04.059 
fellow which was a thousand at the time

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:06.270 
fellow which was a thousand at the time
he<00:01:04.420> finished<00:01:04.809> trees<00:01:05.500> training<00:01:05.860> with<00:01:05.950> king<00:01:06.100> kai

he finished trees training with king kai

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:07.830 
he finished trees training with king kai
and<00:01:06.490> then<00:01:06.729> they<00:01:06.850> added<00:01:07.030> the<00:01:07.330> Super<00:01:07.630> Saiyan

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:07.840 
and then they added the Super Saiyan

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:09.749 
and then they added the Super Saiyan
multipliers<00:01:08.410> then<00:01:08.860> they<00:01:09.070> should<00:01:09.369> not<00:01:09.580> have

00:01:09.749 --> 00:01:09.759 
multipliers then they should not have

00:01:09.759 --> 00:01:12.029 
multipliers then they should not have
done<00:01:09.940> that<00:01:10.000> because<00:01:10.240> that<00:01:10.990> was<00:01:11.170> when<00:01:11.410> Coca<00:01:11.920> was

done that because that was when Coca was

00:01:12.039 --> 00:01:16.010 
done that because that was when Coca was
at<00:01:12.160> his<00:01:12.250> much<00:01:12.670> weaker<00:01:13.149> state<00:01:13.420> now<00:01:14.039> because<00:01:15.039> the

at his much weaker state now because the

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.540 
at his much weaker state now because the
power<00:01:17.020> level<00:01:17.200> for<00:01:17.590> Super<00:01:17.890> Saiyan<00:01:18.130> and<00:01:18.340> base

form Goku against Frieza was the last

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:22.410 
form Goku against Frieza was the last
confirmed<00:01:21.160> was<00:01:21.520> one<00:01:21.670> of<00:01:21.759> the<00:01:21.820> last<00:01:21.940> confirmed

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:22.420 
confirmed was one of the last confirmed

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:26.460 
confirmed was one of the last confirmed
power<00:01:22.899> levels<00:01:23.320> in<00:01:23.830> the<00:01:24.090> design<00:01:25.090> shoe<00:01:25.360> it<00:01:25.630> shows

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:26.470 
power levels in the design shoe it shows

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:32.280 
power levels in the design shoe it shows
that<00:01:26.830> Goku<00:01:27.520> had<00:01:28.330> a<00:01:28.360> base<00:01:28.750> power<00:01:29.049> of<00:01:30.150> of<00:01:31.290> three

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:32.290 
that Goku had a base power of of three

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:34.380 
that Goku had a base power of of three
million<00:01:32.740> so<00:01:33.520> that's<00:01:33.909> what<00:01:34.119> they<00:01:34.210> should<00:01:34.360> have

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:34.390 
million so that's what they should have

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:36.210 
million so that's what they should have
done<00:01:34.509> because<00:01:35.200> that's<00:01:35.439> 11<00:01:36.009> of<00:01:36.100> the<00:01:36.189> last

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:36.220

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:40.570 
confirmed power level I don't understand

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:42.090 
confirmed power level I don't understand
why<00:01:40.780> they<00:01:40.960> did<00:01:41.140> that<00:01:41.170> I<00:01:41.350> mean<00:01:41.560> did<00:01:41.829> they<00:01:41.920> do<00:01:41.979> it

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:42.100 
why they did that I mean did they do it

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:43.679 
why they did that I mean did they do it
on<00:01:42.220> purpose<00:01:42.400> because<00:01:42.729> it<00:01:42.970> was<00:01:43.060> clearly<00:01:43.390> right

00:01:43.679 --> 00:01:43.689 
on purpose because it was clearly right

00:01:43.689 --> 00:01:45.749 
on purpose because it was clearly right
there<00:01:43.990> and<00:01:44.229> it<00:01:44.950> completely<00:01:45.369> changes

00:01:45.749 --> 00:01:45.759 
there and it completely changes

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:47.010 
there and it completely changes

they're like experts either they take

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:52.109 
they're like experts either they take
everything<00:01:50.110> so<00:01:50.560> seriously<00:01:51.040> but<00:01:51.729> I<00:01:51.759> want<00:01:52.060> to

00:01:52.109 --> 00:01:52.119 
everything so seriously but I want to

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:55.319 
everything so seriously but I want to
show<00:01:52.299> you<00:01:52.360> what<00:01:52.840> I<00:01:52.869> did<00:01:53.020> was<00:01:53.439> I<00:01:53.740> got<00:01:54.549> cookies

00:01:55.319 --> 00:01:55.329 
show you what I did was I got cookies

00:01:55.329 --> 00:01:57.690 
show you what I did was I got cookies
power<00:01:55.540> level<00:01:55.930> which<00:01:56.110> was<00:01:56.320> three<00:01:57.070> million<00:01:57.520> and

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:57.700 
power level which was three million and

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:01.859 
power level which was three million and
then<00:01:57.820> I<00:01:57.909> divided<00:01:58.420> that<00:01:58.540> by<00:02:00.479> 8,000<00:02:01.479> and<00:02:01.689> I<00:02:01.750> lost

00:02:01.859 --> 00:02:01.869 
then I divided that by 8,000 and I lost

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:04.080 
then I divided that by 8,000 and I lost
375<00:02:02.740> so<00:02:02.950> what<00:02:03.070> i<00:02:03.100> did<00:02:03.189> is<00:02:03.310> i<00:02:03.579> multiplied

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:04.090 
375 so what i did is i multiplied

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:07.580 
375 so what i did is i multiplied
everything<00:02:04.240> on<00:02:05.140> all<00:02:05.710> of<00:02:06.040> Goku's<00:02:06.250> results<00:02:06.909> by

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
everything on all of Goku's results by

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:12.060 
everything on all of Goku's results by
375<00:02:08.590> and<00:02:09.239> this<00:02:10.239> is<00:02:10.390> what<00:02:10.570> i<00:02:10.600> got<00:02:10.929> so<00:02:11.560> obviously

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:12.070 
375 and this is what i got so obviously

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:14.160 
375 and this is what i got so obviously
Superman's<00:02:12.790> as<00:02:12.940> you<00:02:13.060> seen<00:02:13.269> Superman<00:02:13.690> strength

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.170 
Superman's as you seen Superman strength

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:16.910 
Superman's as you seen Superman strength
was<00:02:14.440> 6.6<00:02:15.340> quintillion<00:02:15.880> tons<00:02:15.910> his<00:02:16.390> strength

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
was 6.6 quintillion tons his strength

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.759 
was 6.6 quintillion tons his strength
then<00:02:17.920> I<00:02:18.040> can<00:02:18.310> lift<00:02:18.459> a<00:02:18.610> push<00:02:18.959> his<00:02:19.959> speed<00:02:20.350> was

00:02:20.759 --> 00:02:20.769 
then I can lift a push his speed was

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:23.490 
then I can lift a push his speed was
nine<00:02:21.160> point<00:02:21.549> four<00:02:21.790> billion<00:02:22.380> kilometers<00:02:23.380> an

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500 
nine point four billion kilometers an

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:24.930 
nine point four billion kilometers an
hour<00:02:23.590> which<00:02:23.829> is<00:02:23.950> a<00:02:23.980> lot<00:02:24.220> times<00:02:24.519> faster<00:02:24.910> than

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:24.940 
hour which is a lot times faster than

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:15.400 
people waited so long and they gave them

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:19.410 
people waited so long and they gave them
full<00:03:15.610> stats<00:03:15.940> and<00:03:17.250> don't<00:03:18.250> forget<00:03:18.460> this<00:03:18.730> is<00:03:19.000> the

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:19.420 
full stats and don't forget this is the

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:23.160 
full stats and don't forget this is the
stats<00:03:19.750> that<00:03:20.740> arm<00:03:21.360> that<00:03:22.360> i<00:03:22.420> multiplied<00:03:23.050> from

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:23.170 
stats that arm that i multiplied from

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:24.780 
stats that arm that i multiplied from
google<00:03:23.470> higher<00:03:23.650> level<00:03:23.950> before<00:03:24.070> verse<00:03:24.490> freezer

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:24.790 
google higher level before verse freezer

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:27.540 
google higher level before verse freezer
so<00:03:25.060> if<00:03:25.180> you<00:03:25.330> multiply<00:03:25.810> with<00:03:26.320> arm<00:03:26.560> you<00:03:27.100> know<00:03:27.130> boo

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:27.550 
so if you multiply with arm you know boo

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:29.670 
so if you multiply with arm you know boo
