00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:54.130 
you tell me where one ends and where one

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:57.539 
you tell me where one ends and where one
begins<00:03:54.630> you<00:03:55.630> cannot<00:03:56.139> tell<00:03:56.739> me<00:03:56.769> where<00:03:57.129> one<00:03:57.310> is

00:03:57.539 --> 00:03:57.549 
begins you cannot tell me where one is

00:03:57.549 --> 00:03:59.250 
begins you cannot tell me where one is
and<00:03:57.819> where<00:03:57.940> one<00:03:58.090> begins<00:03:58.239> because<00:03:58.599> they<00:03:58.959> look
