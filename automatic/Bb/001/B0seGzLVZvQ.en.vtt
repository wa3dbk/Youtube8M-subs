00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:08.519
 what rules you need to follow when 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:09.830
 installing vinyl siding and 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:12.750
 improper installation 

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:14.730
 fasteners must be installed in the center 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.800
 these perforated holes which 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.830
 specially made oblong to 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.539
 the panel was free to move and 

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:23.820
 of course you need to leave a gap of about 1 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:27.390
 millimeter between cap and surface 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:29.760
 panels if the crate is not perforated 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.980
 matches then you need to cut through fasteners 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:36.030
 a spacious hole for the panel to have 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:37.350
 possibility of a free year butt joints 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.480
 panels with fasteners 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.030
 a gap of about 7-10 is left 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.710
 millimeters 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:45.870
 these mounting rules allow for change 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.690
 siding size when changing 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.430
 ambient temperature 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:52.800
 now we have consistently broken 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:56.039
 installation rules and see what it is 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:59.340
 will lead here we will twist the screw to the edge 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:01.289
 perforations they are in the center like this further we 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:04.170
 included screw ignore altogether 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:08.220
 perforation right into the panel itself and in two 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:11.130
 the ground also secured the panel so tight 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:13.110
 that she will not be able to move and finally 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.600
 the end of the panel rests on the bar 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.860
 fittings and there is no backlash at 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.080
 thermal expansion 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:23.700
 here we see that in front of the panel 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:26.800
 the beginning of the experiment shit without flaws 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:31.500
 now we stood the panels in the sun and 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:38.410
 notice the time here we are at 30 track 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:41.020
 speeding up the playback of the movie passed 

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:42.870
 only 10 minutes and see what 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:46.030
 changes 

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:49.140
 where we fixed the panel to the edge of the tedx 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:51.070
 by walkie-talkie and and there was no free move and 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:54.310
 she arched 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:57.340
 But look what happened on the site 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:02:00.520
 between two self-tapping screws directly 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:02.680
 in the panel and finally 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:06.550
 this is what absence from 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:10.320
 thermal gap from the end panel and how 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:10.320
 wish panel installed and corrected 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.890
 look 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:23.960
 remarkably no deformations 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:27.290
 again 

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:28.370
 it is installed at the bottom of the panel correctly 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:32.630
 like a thread 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:39.980
 and the top panel is installed incorrectly 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:42.670
 and therefore it is deformed respect 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:42.670
 installation rules
