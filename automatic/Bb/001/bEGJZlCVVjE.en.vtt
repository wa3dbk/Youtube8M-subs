00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:08.970
 well I think it's a pride it's a 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:11.519
 privilege to be here again not as 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.469
 said the professor diego america in the vein 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:16.150
 zeta on the moon in all sectors 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:18.340
 of the planet is america 

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:21.430
 is in a difficult moment a very phase 

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:25.480
 complicated where it should never have arrived like this 

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:28.970
 that we with our desire with this 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:31.039
 I work a very hard work 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:34.309
 and get the team back to that 

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:36.820
 site we knew that he was watching the 

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:38.900
 side of the rest of the coaching staff 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:42.530
 players 

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:45.530
 of sub 19 sub 20 that they gave exactly 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:47.270
 of that group that could serve you if 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:49.490
 now there are interesting players there 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:50.900
 interesting players 

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:52.790
 which we were the opportunity to 

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:56.200
 see it on Friday the Saturday we had 

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:58.130
 seeing the category of cardona teacher 

00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:00.830
 he came out champion there are also players 

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:03.170
 interesting since there is nothing there is a 

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:05.420
 series of players that 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:07.280
 that are the future of the institution a 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:10.460
 institution that is very hit that 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:11.930
 The people need us all to be 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:13.939
 united for this team to come out 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:16.130
 ahead so we are very happy 

00:01:13.939 --> 00:01:18.470
 for that and there are some possibilities of 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:19.880
 players of the sub-20 of the minors of 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:21.860
 that are with us so we're going 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:23.509
 to continue observing and alavÃ©s how old 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:24.680
 put everything all subjective of 

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:26.299
 belonging so that the team leaves 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:28.430
 forward what concepts took 

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:30.619
 you of the group that remained of the group 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:33.080
 that he could not ascend and really from there 

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:36.289
 that can serve good we are in that 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:40.220
 we are evaluating we are considering 

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:42.409
 the condition of the players' team 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:44.179
 that we need and then they will give 

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:46.280
 know the players that we are going to have 

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:47.350
 in account how many resources are going to get 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:49.810
 to america 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:53.110
 well I think that the fundamental thing is 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:54.909
 spine america any not 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:57.850
 play in america america this shirt 

00:01:54.909 --> 00:01:59.860
 it weighs a lot too much you have to look at the 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:01.810
 mental part the character part of 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:03.790
 personality vividly the conditions 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:05.110
 as a bowler who thinks he is 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:07.119
 you in this category that for you 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:09.580
 is the new the new but I think that 

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:11.440
 football remains the same 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:13.650
 first of all today in football day 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:17.620
 current you have to prepare mentally 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:19.660
 physically and obviously tactically I 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:23.830
 I think they are 11 against 11 the same 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:25.660
 ball the same courts so I yo 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:29.140
 I do not see difference only the letter for 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:30.430
 you are not new to be champions not me 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:33.040
 I do not think this is a brand anymore 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:35.410
 also like that of america and we want 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:37.080
 revalidate day to day and I think that 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:39.760
 the team the identity of the technicians 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:41.680
 both diego and I play very well at 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:45.330
 football and obviously we ask and we decide 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:45.330
 that the team plays well
