think you you can't afford to think that

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.530 
think you you can't afford to think that
way<00:01:10.650> I<00:01:10.920> think<00:01:11.220> it's<00:01:11.340> something<00:01:11.490> you<00:01:11.729> know<00:01:12.330> I

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
way I think it's something you know I

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.600 
way I think it's something you know I
think<00:01:12.869> you<00:01:13.110> can<00:01:13.260> only<00:01:13.380> control<00:01:13.560> what<00:01:14.100> you<00:01:14.130> can

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
think you can only control what you can

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.760 
think you can only control what you can
control<00:01:14.820> and<00:01:15.420> certainly<00:01:15.780> do<00:01:15.960> what<00:01:16.200> you<00:01:16.320> do

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
control and certainly do what you do

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.950 
control and certainly do what you do
best<00:01:16.950> I<00:01:17.310> think<00:01:17.939> everyone<00:01:18.240> was<00:01:18.420> thinking<00:01:18.570> about

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
best I think everyone was thinking about

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.820 
best I think everyone was thinking about
pushing<00:01:19.740> that<00:01:20.520> relay<00:01:20.880> in<00:01:21.119> order<00:01:21.330> to<00:01:21.570> to<00:01:22.409> do<00:01:22.560> we

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
pushing that relay in order to to do we

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.620 
pushing that relay in order to to do we
knew<00:01:22.979> we<00:01:23.100> could<00:01:23.250> accomplish<00:01:23.430> and<00:01:24.060> that<00:01:24.420> was<00:01:24.540> to

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
knew we could accomplish and that was to

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.420 
knew we could accomplish and that was to
win<00:01:24.780> we<00:01:24.930> identify<00:01:25.320> years<00:01:25.530> ago<00:01:25.770> with<00:01:26.130> more<00:01:26.340> or

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
win we identify years ago with more or

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:27.740 
win we identify years ago with more or
less<00:01:26.549> the<00:01:26.670> same<00:01:26.700> guys<00:01:27.030> in<00:01:27.150> the<00:01:27.210> relay<00:01:27.509> and<00:01:27.659> so

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
less the same guys in the relay and so

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.260 
less the same guys in the relay and so
we<00:01:27.869> knew<00:01:28.020> what<00:01:28.170> it<00:01:28.259> would<00:01:28.350> take<00:01:28.590> and<00:01:29.090> it<00:01:30.090> wasn't

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
we knew what it would take and it wasn't

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:31.520 
we knew what it would take and it wasn't
really<00:01:30.450> until<00:01:30.600> after<00:01:30.990> the<00:01:31.079> race<00:01:31.229> when<00:01:31.439> we
