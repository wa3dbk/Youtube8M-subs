exercise and then I'm going to take you
through<00:00:38.980> a<00:00:39.010> bunch<00:00:39.280> of<00:00:39.519> foot<00:00:39.699> speed<00:00:39.940> drills<00:00:40.210> now

00:00:41.069 --> 00:00:41.079 
through a bunch of foot speed drills now

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:43.229 
through a bunch of foot speed drills now
when<00:00:41.260> you're<00:00:41.379> boxing<00:00:41.859> all<00:00:42.070> your<00:00:42.250> power<00:00:42.489> comes

00:00:43.229 --> 00:00:43.239 
when you're boxing all your power comes

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:44.790 
when you're boxing all your power comes
from<00:00:43.359> every<00:00:43.839> punch<00:00:44.050> starts<00:00:44.320> from<00:00:44.440> your<00:00:44.559> foot

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:44.800 
from every punch starts from your foot

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:47.130 
from every punch starts from your foot
so<00:00:45.429> a<00:00:45.460> lot<00:00:45.670> of<00:00:45.699> that<00:00:45.850> is<00:00:46.030> explosive<00:00:46.719> power<00:00:46.899> that

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:47.140 
so a lot of that is explosive power that

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:48.509 
so a lot of that is explosive power that
we<00:00:47.199> can<00:00:47.230> train<00:00:47.530> in<00:00:47.649> the<00:00:47.739> gym<00:00:47.769> but<00:00:48.309> a<00:00:48.339> lot<00:00:48.489> of

00:00:48.509 --> 00:00:48.519 
we can train in the gym but a lot of

00:00:48.519 --> 00:00:50.369 
we can train in the gym but a lot of
what<00:00:48.699> we<00:00:48.789> can<00:00:48.879> train<00:00:49.089> outside<00:00:49.239> to<00:00:49.629> and<00:00:49.870> more

00:00:50.369 --> 00:00:50.379 
what we can train outside to and more

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:51.900 
what we can train outside to and more
and<00:00:50.499> more<00:00:50.649> we're<00:00:50.800> seeing<00:00:50.829> fighters<00:00:51.399> head

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:51.910 
and more we're seeing fighters head

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:53.340 
and more we're seeing fighters head
outside<00:00:52.120> to<00:00:52.390> the<00:00:52.690> track<00:00:52.989> and<00:00:53.199> do<00:00:53.320> a

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:53.350 
outside to the track and do a

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:55.020 
outside to the track and do a
plyometrics<00:00:54.010> for<00:00:54.190> their<00:00:54.309> training<00:00:54.640> so<00:00:54.909> what

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:55.030 
plyometrics for their training so what

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:56.520 
plyometrics for their training so what
I'm<00:00:55.089> going<00:00:55.210> to<00:00:55.239> do<00:00:55.329> is<00:00:55.420> going<00:00:55.539> to<00:00:55.629> show<00:00:55.749> you<00:00:55.809> two

I'm going to do is going to show you two
two<00:00:57.309> different<00:00:57.609> kinds<00:00:57.789> of<00:00:57.850> walks<00:00:58.059> drums<00:00:58.359> and

00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:58.510 
two different kinds of walks drums and

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:01.349 
two different kinds of walks drums and
then<00:00:58.600> a<00:00:58.629> drop<00:00:58.989> jump<00:00:59.519> the<00:01:00.519> first<00:01:00.789> box<00:01:01.059> jump

00:01:01.349 --> 00:01:01.359 
then a drop jump the first box jump

00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:03.779 
then a drop jump the first box jump
we're<00:01:02.319> working<00:01:02.589> on<00:01:02.710> explosiveness<00:01:03.339> and

00:01:03.779 --> 00:01:03.789 
we're working on explosiveness and

00:01:03.789 --> 00:01:05.490 
we're working on explosiveness and
dropping<00:01:04.210> down<00:01:04.540> so<00:01:04.809> I'm<00:01:04.900> going<00:01:05.019> to<00:01:05.080> start<00:01:05.320> from

00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:05.500 
dropping down so I'm going to start from

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:08.010 
dropping down so I'm going to start from
up<00:01:05.680> here<00:01:05.979> drop<00:01:06.729> down<00:01:07.000> and<00:01:07.299> spend<00:01:07.750> as<00:01:07.869> little

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:08.020 
up here drop down and spend as little

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:09.660 
up here drop down and spend as little
time<00:01:08.380> on<00:01:08.409> the<00:01:08.680> ground<00:01:08.890> as<00:01:08.979> possible<00:01:09.009> then

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:09.670 
time on the ground as possible then

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:12.840 
time on the ground as possible then
explode<00:01:10.030> right<00:01:10.210> back<00:01:10.420> up<00:01:10.799> I'll<00:01:11.799> show<00:01:12.159> five

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:12.850 
explode right back up I'll show five

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:25.010 
explode right back up I'll show five
reps<00:01:13.119> of<00:01:13.299> this<00:01:13.420> real<00:01:14.259> twins

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.539 

so<00:01:26.020> the<00:01:26.110> goal<00:01:26.320> with<00:01:26.470> that<00:01:26.500> is<00:01:26.950> to<00:01:27.250> keep<00:01:27.400> your

00:01:27.539 --> 00:01:27.549 
so the goal with that is to keep your

00:01:27.549 --> 00:01:29.429 
so the goal with that is to keep your
feet<00:01:27.729> on<00:01:27.909> the<00:01:27.939> ground<00:01:28.180> for<00:01:28.960> as<00:01:29.020> little<00:01:29.170> time<00:01:29.409> as

00:01:29.429 --> 00:01:29.439 
feet on the ground for as little time as

00:01:29.439 --> 00:01:31.320 
feet on the ground for as little time as
possible<00:01:30.009> and<00:01:30.250> you're<00:01:30.369> exploding<00:01:30.850> up<00:01:31.119> that's

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:31.330 
possible and you're exploding up that's

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:32.910 
possible and you're exploding up that's
where<00:01:31.420> you<00:01:31.509> get<00:01:31.570> a<00:01:31.630> lot<00:01:31.780> of<00:01:31.840> explosive<00:01:32.770> power

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:32.920 
where you get a lot of explosive power

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:34.499 
where you get a lot of explosive power
and<00:01:33.040> it's<00:01:33.189> a<00:01:33.280> true<00:01:33.490> plyometric<00:01:34.060> right<00:01:34.210> there

00:01:34.499 --> 00:01:34.509 
and it's a true plyometric right there

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:37.080 
and it's a true plyometric right there
second<00:01:35.500> one<00:01:35.619> is<00:01:35.979> a<00:01:36.040> straight<00:01:36.369> up<00:01:36.399> box<00:01:36.820> trunk

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:37.090 
second one is a straight up box trunk

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:38.010 
second one is a straight up box trunk
where<00:01:37.180> you're<00:01:37.270> starting<00:01:37.570> from<00:01:37.659> a<00:01:37.780> standstill

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:38.020 
where you're starting from a standstill

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:40.499 
where you're starting from a standstill
and<00:01:38.470> exploding<00:01:39.280> up<00:01:39.399> to<00:01:39.549> a<00:01:39.580> higher<00:01:39.850> level<00:01:39.880> I'll

00:01:40.499 --> 00:01:40.509 
and exploding up to a higher level I'll

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:43.109 
and exploding up to a higher level I'll
show<00:01:40.659> you<00:01:40.750> that<00:01:40.840> right<00:01:40.990> now<00:01:41.110> as<00:01:41.229> well<00:01:41.409> so<00:01:42.119> with
