00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:54.920 
down actually goes from from zero down

00:02:54.920 --> 00:03:00.940 
down actually goes from from zero down
to<00:02:55.250> about<00:02:56.150> there<00:02:56.799> and<00:02:57.799> then<00:02:58.489> when<00:02:58.879> i<00:02:59.680> go<00:03:00.680> to<00:03:00.709> get
