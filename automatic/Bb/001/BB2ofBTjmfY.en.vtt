distance<00:02:49.560> from<00:02:50.070> each<00:02:50.310> other<00:02:51.080> and<00:02:52.080> let<00:02:52.830> try

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
distance from each other and let try

00:02:53.220 --> 00:03:00.350 
distance from each other and let try
this<00:02:53.750> over<00:02:54.750> here<00:02:55.550> and<00:02:56.550> then<00:02:57.860> and<00:02:58.860> why<00:02:59.790> don't<00:02:59.850> we

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 
this over here and then and why don't we

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:04.400 
this over here and then and why don't we
do<00:03:00.630> we<00:03:01.560> want<00:03:01.830> to<00:03:01.920> control<00:03:02.400> it<00:03:02.640> down<00:03:02.910> to<00:03:03.120> be<00:03:03.410> away

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:16.789 
from each other so we should be able to
play<00:03:09.870> about<00:03:11.930> 20<00:03:12.930> ah<00:03:14.480> here<00:03:15.480> we<00:03:15.750> could<00:03:16.170> get<00:03:16.470> lower

00:03:16.789 --> 00:03:16.799 
play about 20 ah here we could get lower

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:22.759 
play about 20 ah here we could get lower
