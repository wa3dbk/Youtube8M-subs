00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
imaging place that might it sits right

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:48.950 
imaging place that might it sits right
next<00:01:43.860> to<00:01:44.280> the<00:01:44.869> the<00:01:46.040> Providence<00:01:47.180> Medical<00:01:48.180> some

sort of medical facility and then this

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:57.859 
sort of medical facility and then this
is<00:01:51.810> like<00:01:52.170> an<00:01:52.350> imaging<00:01:52.920> place<00:01:56.390> so<00:01:57.390> I'm<00:01:57.689> not

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
is like an imaging place so I'm not

00:01:57.869 --> 00:01:59.420 
is like an imaging place so I'm not
really<00:01:57.960> quite<00:01:58.200> sure<00:01:58.409> what<00:01:58.619> those<00:01:58.829> things<00:01:59.070> are

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
really quite sure what those things are

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:05.120 
really quite sure what those things are

obviously<00:02:05.399> there's<00:02:06.000> the<00:02:06.090> google<00:02:06.570> machine<00:02:06.899> or

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
obviously there's the google machine or

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:09.809 
obviously there's the google machine or
something<00:02:07.819> but

00:02:09.809 --> 00:02:09.819 
something but

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:12.449

when you exit the street view you look

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:15.869 
when you exit the street view you look
above<00:02:12.819> there<00:02:13.209> they<00:02:13.420> are<00:02:14.310> what<00:02:15.310> are<00:02:15.609> these

00:02:15.869 --> 00:02:15.879
