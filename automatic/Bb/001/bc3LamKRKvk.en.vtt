 Well next here addy 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:20.689
 I 'm poisoned by this email address 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:24.949
 I would like to try to see if it can be sent properly 

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:27.340
 That 's why the terminal is brave enough to listen to everything 

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:27.340
 let's go 

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:34.910
 I sent a noodle essay child 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:36.530

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:38.140
 Still not 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:41.550
 Still not 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:41.550
 Still not 

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:52.410
 We have passed since er date by entering I mean 

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:56.820
 About asking if it is 8 here 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:58.460
 Now back to the sp mode mail 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.820
 why 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:03.090
 Tokoro mail 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:07.840

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:10.620
 And it means Tsu or was not in laden not'm just as it is of 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:12.770

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:17.289
 Wintering 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:17.289
 It's a notification, it's like this 

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:27.260
 Even though this notification has been sent, the email has not been received yet 

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:28.220
 Has been received in only still guy itself came the announcement Tteyuu I just simply hangs 

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:34.640
 not 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:35.960
 So I open the genuine iphone mail application for e-mail, and I have a consultation at that time. 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:37.830
 I will 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:42.770
 Though 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:46.710
 But this is now of Cho security or battery empty required you to baseball 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:51.350
 It is easier in two ways sp mode 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:54.380
 Well , I'm back to sp mode mail 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:57.009
 Oh my dearest man 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:57.009
 Tableware 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.960
 Soft Bank's 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:05.909
 iphone 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:08.800
 It looks like it was like that in the beginning 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:12.990
 Yes cat notifications 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:16.790
 When you receive the Well-mail 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:19.310
 That does not have any Are you sure that you want to notify 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:22.790
 I have a choice 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:24.319
 Of where e-mail at the time of that set 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:30.000
 That 

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:31.100
 When is that there does not notify Ki Then nothing happens I get you to notice 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.760
 distribution 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:36.170
 I just do not know at all until I open the genuine app 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:39.680
 That the 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:43.760
 It will be for a while until the notification works 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:48.960
 I think you should go to the middle of sp mode mail 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:50.560
 That 's how I set up docomo mail 

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:54.420

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:58.640
