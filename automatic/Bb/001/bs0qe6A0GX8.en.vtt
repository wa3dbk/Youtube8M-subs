00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:01.599 
syrup now the reason for the maple syrup
is<00:00:58.940> this<00:00:59.390> helps<00:00:59.750> to<00:01:00.079> sweeten<00:01:01.010> the<00:01:01.100> beverage<00:01:01.460> as

00:01:01.599 --> 00:01:01.609 
is this helps to sweeten the beverage as

00:01:01.609 --> 00:01:04.030 
is this helps to sweeten the beverage as
well<00:01:01.940> as<00:01:02.149> it<00:01:02.510> helps<00:01:02.960> it<00:01:03.050> to<00:01:03.170> blend<00:01:03.410> really<00:01:03.679> well

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:04.040 
well as it helps it to blend really well

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:05.670 
well as it helps it to blend really well
so<00:01:04.280> that<00:01:04.309> it's<00:01:04.580> very<00:01:04.760> smooth<00:01:05.180> and<00:01:05.330> consistent

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:05.680 
so that it's very smooth and consistent

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:09.100 
so that it's very smooth and consistent
so<00:01:06.680> once<00:01:06.860> you<00:01:07.010> have<00:01:07.190> that<00:01:07.550> half<00:01:08.540> a<00:01:08.660> cup<00:01:08.900> of

so once you have that half a cup of
maple<00:01:09.260> syrup<00:01:09.740> in<00:01:09.860> there<00:01:10.040> we're<00:01:10.550> then<00:01:10.730> gonna

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:10.880 
maple syrup in there we're then gonna

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:13.420 
maple syrup in there we're then gonna
measure<00:01:11.150> out<00:01:11.480> 16<00:01:12.140> ounces<00:01:12.800> of<00:01:12.860> ice<00:01:13.070> and<00:01:13.310> what

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:13.430 
measure out 16 ounces of ice and what

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:14.650 
measure out 16 ounces of ice and what
we're<00:01:13.550> gonna<00:01:13.640> do<00:01:13.880> is<00:01:14.060> we're<00:01:14.270> simply<00:01:14.630> just

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:14.660 
we're gonna do is we're simply just

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:17.200 
we're gonna do is we're simply just
gonna<00:01:14.990> add<00:01:15.200> the<00:01:15.230> ice<00:01:15.680> to<00:01:16.070> our<00:01:16.100> 16-ounce<00:01:16.790> glass

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:17.210 
gonna add the ice to our 16-ounce glass

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:22.320 
gonna add the ice to our 16-ounce glass
and<00:01:18.490> that'll<00:01:19.490> give<00:01:19.640> us<00:01:19.820> a<00:01:19.970> rough<00:01:20.240> estimate<00:01:20.810> of

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:22.330 
and that'll give us a rough estimate of

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:25.330 
and that'll give us a rough estimate of
16<00:01:23.330> ounces<00:01:23.660> of<00:01:23.780> ice<00:01:23.930> once<00:01:24.740> you<00:01:24.860> have<00:01:25.010> that<00:01:25.190> you

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:25.340 
16 ounces of ice once you have that you

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:26.470 
16 ounces of ice once you have that you
can<00:01:25.460> just<00:01:25.490> leave<00:01:25.760> that<00:01:25.790> off<00:01:26.000> to<00:01:26.120> the<00:01:26.240> side

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:26.480 
can just leave that off to the side

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:28.320 
can just leave that off to the side
until<00:01:26.720> we<00:01:27.230> add<00:01:27.380> the<00:01:27.530> rest<00:01:27.710> of<00:01:27.860> our<00:01:27.950> ingredients

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:28.330 
until we add the rest of our ingredients

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:30.640 
until we add the rest of our ingredients
so<00:01:29.330> once<00:01:29.510> we<00:01:29.630> have<00:01:29.720> all<00:01:29.930> those<00:01:30.110> basic

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:30.650 
so once we have all those basic

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:32.470 
so once we have all those basic
ingredients<00:01:31.190> in<00:01:31.310> our<00:01:31.400> blender<00:01:31.820> we're<00:01:32.300> then

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:32.480 
ingredients in our blender we're then

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:35.290 
ingredients in our blender we're then
