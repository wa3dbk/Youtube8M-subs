bouncy<00:03:15.260> signals<00:03:15.680> this<00:03:15.799> is<00:03:15.889> another<00:03:16.160> bounty

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:16.430 
bouncy signals this is another bounty

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:18.520 
bouncy signals this is another bounty
signal<00:03:16.970> but<00:03:17.150> it<00:03:17.750> seems<00:03:17.959> to<00:03:18.019> be<00:03:18.139> settling

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:18.530 
signal but it seems to be settling

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:20.890 
signal but it seems to be settling
somewhere<00:03:18.920> where<00:03:19.519> small<00:03:19.970> silver<00:03:20.359> coins<00:03:20.630> lie

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:20.900 
somewhere where small silver coins lie

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:29.580 
somewhere where small silver coins lie
so<00:03:21.200> I'm<00:03:21.410> kind<00:03:22.370> of<00:03:22.489> hoping<00:03:22.790> it's<00:03:22.940> a<00:03:23.000> coin

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:29.590 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:43.559 

ah<00:03:37.769> it's<00:03:38.769> not<00:03:38.950> a<00:03:38.980> coin

00:03:43.559 --> 00:03:43.569 

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:46.199 

it<00:03:44.140> looks<00:03:44.499> like<00:03:44.620> local<00:03:45.370> lead<00:03:45.609> like<00:03:45.819> a<00:03:45.849> musket

00:03:46.199 --> 00:03:46.209 
it looks like local lead like a musket

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:49.979 
it looks like local lead like a musket
ball<00:03:46.239> that<00:03:46.599> hit<00:03:46.749> something<00:03:48.719> yeah<00:03:49.719> I<00:03:49.749> think

00:03:49.979 --> 00:03:49.989 
ball that hit something yeah I think
