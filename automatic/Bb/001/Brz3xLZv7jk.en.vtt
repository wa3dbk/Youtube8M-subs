throughout<00:01:36.300> the<00:01:36.390> course<00:01:36.660> of<00:01:36.750> a<00:01:36.840> season<00:01:37.050> is

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
throughout the course of a season is

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.330 
throughout the course of a season is
vital<00:01:38.220> and<00:01:38.690> you<00:01:39.690> know<00:01:39.780> they're<00:01:40.620> testing<00:01:41.160> for<00:01:41.190> a

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
vital and you know they're testing for a

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.670 
vital and you know they're testing for a
lot<00:01:41.520> more<00:01:41.700> of<00:01:41.760> the<00:01:42.210> substances<00:01:43.050> these<00:01:43.230> days<00:01:43.470> so

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
lot more of the substances these days so

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.070 
lot more of the substances these days so
we<00:01:43.710> can't<00:01:44.300> try<00:01:45.300> and<00:01:45.420> cheat<00:01:45.570> the<00:01:45.690> system<00:01:45.840> in

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:46.080 
we can't try and cheat the system in

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:48.170 
we can't try and cheat the system in
that<00:01:46.200> sense<00:01:46.500> so<00:01:46.710> if<00:01:47.310> we<00:01:47.520> can<00:01:47.640> use<00:01:47.820> something

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
that sense so if we can use something

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.810 
that sense so if we can use something
