00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:06.360
 control exactly and me 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.210
 would say the test will be the same 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.700
 Now we have the one outside where we have 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.799
 So the other toy exists 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.259

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:20.140
 one and we still have one here 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:22.430
 fuchs provide the controls 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:26.120
 seen the two constituencies not so 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:27.110
 cheap 1000 gold baja 1000 gold believes 

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:28.730
 they tasted 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:33.590
 he will say that it is looking then 

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:39.440
 We'll have it here 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:42.350
 the first top of the control and there 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:43.010
 we can then fly again 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:45.800
 control 

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:49.280
 This time it's really a fox okay 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:50.960
 not so long then that part then 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:53.500
 Let's take a look at the second one 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:53.500
 higher stand 

00:01:55.870 --> 00:02:00.610
 well I have to appear here 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:02.870
 to work 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:04.130
 We have the table here and if 

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:06.230
 you read through the text here 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:08.240
 when another launches Bavarian the 

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:09.500
 closeness is then stack up which I have to 

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:11.570
 confess I have never seen this 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:13.280
 that you started the deer that 

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:14.920
 whole now has a bit too 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:17.060
 cooldown 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:19.280
 I still think here with several 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:20.480
 Players who apply then you can here 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:22.490
 accordingly a bit the 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:24.200
 stack fresh on top of each other if that 

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:25.310
 be sensible is now left open 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:27.790
 In any case, a very funny 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:27.790
 immigration 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:32.959
 then I have the position here 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:35.780
 changed and although I am now in 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:37.640
 frosty nordend in the storm summit 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:39.650
 and there is the third album 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:41.000
 that I want to show you it is 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:43.459
 namely here about this iron 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.330
 hip-hop and we can do that here 

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:47.060
 buy warehouse 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:49.160
 it was you are here we are in here 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:52.070
 This ice fortress is your storm 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:57.010
 summit relatively far to the south of the storm 

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:59.120
 summit and this is an alliance 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:01.550
 fortress not to tell me now but so 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:04.580
 a small dwelling and I think 

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:07.190
 times ahead then there is one 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:08.780
 few dollars to where to get this one 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:10.550
 iron flat man can buy 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:12.200
 but here you can play as an alliance player 

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:13.820
 buy them here easily and 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:16.250
 Although you need this one here 

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:18.010
 relics of ulduar and you receive 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:20.090
 actually from all these dwarfs the 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:22.459
 there are dwarves around there 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:24.980
 relatively many running around here or 

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:26.030
 but also in the instance or the 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:27.920
 Instances here 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:29.540
 there are echoing places here 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:31.489
 among others 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:33.680
 and what was that other the halls of the 

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:35.019
 thunder I do not remember exactly 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:38.920
 every case exists for two instances 

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:43.159
 we can also take a quick look 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:45.379
 and the halls of the stone it was exactly 

00:03:43.159 --> 00:03:47.599
 all squares and halls of the stone and there 

00:03:45.379 --> 00:03:48.769
 There are actually relatively these brands 

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:51.260
 is talking about when you farm the farms 

00:03:48.769 --> 00:03:52.790
 then you want to be up here 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:53.810
 the two instances can be there 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:55.970
 go in and change accordingly 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:58.310
 brands or you just found it here 

00:03:55.970 --> 00:04:00.530
 the dwarves are actually here 

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:03.099
 yes, a whole upper part of the 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:07.659
 storm peak 

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:07.659
 I can show I guess after the 

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:16.070
 landtmann and that was transform it 

00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:17.479
 Insert pages 

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:19.699
 then we will shut up accordingly 

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:22.669
 So you see this traveling dwarf here 

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:24.139
 even how the whole thing looks like that 

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:27.289
 an information in the country by the way 

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:31.460
 it also needs a deeper one 

00:04:27.289 --> 00:04:35.150
 that was in ulduar at the council 

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:37.760
 it's how many bosses you could 

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:39.800
 boss said if you have all of it 

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:41.690
 you also need this page 

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:46.789
 for a deep one accordingly 

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:48.020
 It's worth it twice now 

00:04:46.789 --> 00:04:49.669
 I have the position again 

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:51.860
 changed and am a nice one here 

00:04:49.669 --> 00:04:53.449
 shara because here is the fourth and 

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:55.880
 last toy that I have to you today 

00:04:53.449 --> 00:04:58.430
 want to show and that is how it is here 

00:04:55.880 --> 00:05:00.409
 a bit hidden on a hill 

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:02.720
 you see here have a tower and in 

00:05:00.409 --> 00:05:04.940
 There is a dealer of this tower 

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:07.400
 we sold the toy here especially 

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:09.139
 Show and that changed loudly that 

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:10.460
 we can also enter the tower show 

00:05:09.139 --> 00:05:12.949
 I'm quick on the kart here 

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:14.720
 we are in aschara so calendar 

00:05:12.949 --> 00:05:17.240
 aschara and then we have this one here 

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:20.300
 small tower and where we have 

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:23.620
 these jacobsen and sold 

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:26.500
 relatively expensive toys 

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:29.800
 this calibers spook medallion and that 

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:32.560
 buy us now just look what 

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:33.940
 that immediately to get out, we give the 

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:34.389
 was maybe a bit better sighted 

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:35.800
 to have 

00:05:34.389 --> 00:05:37.300
 I have not selected myself yet 

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:41.830
 I do not know what it just makes me easy 

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:42.610
 I have it in any case already 

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:44.620
 learned 

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:48.060
 Now let's look at what's up 

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:48.060
 No, we do not want to go there 

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:53.860
 Now let's face that we do not 

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:55.330
 again the same mistake as over the 

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:59.710
 You've never had it before 

00:05:55.330 --> 00:06:03.760
 see what happens put that one and 

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:05.199
 You will be ok for this eleven here 

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:06.760
 not very spectacular now 

00:06:05.199 --> 00:06:09.820
 I do not know earlier that had some 

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:11.110
 to whom I've ever played that 

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:12.340
 you just did not see anything else 

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:14.830
 tolerate 

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:16.720
 if that's not great , of course 

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:19.510
 True or not, put it there 

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:21.160
 but I had one for that we see the 

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:23.260
 it's just stopping now 

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:25.410
 just a nice image in where to get 

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:27.520
 if you can change with the 

00:06:25.410 --> 00:06:30.039
 shape or the appearance of the character 

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:31.690
 I will not be so happy 

00:06:30.039 --> 00:06:33.729
 but among other things pack dome get that 

00:06:31.690 --> 00:06:34.840
 is another story yes 

00:06:33.729 --> 00:06:36.729
 then we are already at the end again 

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:38.620
 From the video I hope I get 

00:06:36.729 --> 00:06:40.960
