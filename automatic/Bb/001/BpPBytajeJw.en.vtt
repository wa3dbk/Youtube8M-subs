00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:37.519
 finally lie harmony transformed 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:38.989
 a very special highlight since 

00:00:37.519 --> 00:00:41.030
 the michael bauer harmonica exist 

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:43.730
 World was our one-week mediterranean 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:45.620
 cruise on the msc musica with the 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:46.309
 world record attempt for the guinness book of the 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:49.489
 rekorde 

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:51.049
 yes and it worked 54 

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:53.899
 harmonica players made music together 

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:56.030
 in this unique harmonica 

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:58.129
 orchestra and she does not just play one 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:02.140
 song the star polka but same as 

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:02.140
 add a second and wanders 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:19.570
 that everyone is in the right time for it 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:21.640
 should hans betz ours 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:23.920
 training manager and as Kapellmeister 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:26.260
 and choreographer was of course full in 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:29.460
 his element and the musician's beginning 

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:29.460
 record very well 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:16.270
 criterion for this world record attempt 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:18.400
 the one in the official guinness book 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:20.730
 Incidentally, the wording is worded this way 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:23.440
 moment you can read it 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:25.390
 the largest group of diatonic 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:27.520
 playing harmonica will become one 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:30.670
 cruise a collectible piece learned 

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:35.080
 and presented for quite a long time 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:36.520
 text but it's just a special 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:39.310
 criterion for this world record attempt 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:41.770
 just that piece was just on board 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:43.570
 had to be taught and that is 

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:46.540
 but a very nice big one 

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:47.290
 challenge for the teacher and also 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:49.360
 for the students 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:51.490
 probably had swings from the ship 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:53.610
 but rather not quite the clock of 

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:53.610
 music 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:02.780
 Rome stand Charles Bridge of the sandwich 

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:02.780
 Strengthen exactly 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:10.100
 because it is so 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:18.110
 So great is the world record attempt 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:21.140
 We were succeeded by the captain 

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:23.629
 msc musica marco maser finally too 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:26.390
 confirms the captain is the highest 

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:29.900
 instance on board and thus is a place 

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:31.400
 on the other hand practically the motto who 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:34.849
 such a world record attempt 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:37.220
 usually do not concern special ones 

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:40.940
 Expectations long lane of over 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:43.489
 touristic I'm you then on the 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:47.000

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:48.830
 that moment always winters me 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.500
 trip itself took a week 

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:53.989
 It started in Venice a wonderful 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:55.329
