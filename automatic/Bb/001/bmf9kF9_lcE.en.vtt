00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:09.470
 the apple debated by words way halloween 

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:11.390

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:25.670
 this scene so it's the lipstick 

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:28.100
 paris tomorrow so it's a match it's 

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:30.290
 a limited example but as giscours of 

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:33.110
 and matri hold so well so 

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:38.390
 it's a red but a little more pink and 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:41.120
 so know more dewy about me but with 

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:44.030

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:46.010
 a lot and I have ice making it I 

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:47.870
 not wearing today but I think 

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:50.690
 per second managed to make fun I had 

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:52.480
 advised men boxing and those 

00:04:50.690 --> 00:05:00.350
 violations 

00:04:52.480 --> 00:05:03.410
 samantha would just like one thing if the 

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:05.120
 continent boeing of benefit so more 

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:08.120
 normally use this moment the 

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:12.440
 ceatec number 2 but it's him that I 

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:14.750
 trolling and there is a lot left so I'm 

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:16.520
 I need playing time including three 

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:19.310
 days but I practically use 

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:20.690
 so I have it all there was 

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:24.580
 in my mind 

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:30.170
 so no it remains of my bag 

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:32.270
 I have my age and so and my agenda is 

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:34.250
 must I turn everywhere so 

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:40.090
 you have seen in any full videos 

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:40.090
 that our turn does not happen so I do not 

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:48.360
 from where these miscreants fiction then dropped 

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:51.150
 streaks in there because I have 

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:53.310
 not yet finished well below this pencil 

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:59.729
 but when I have them in my doctor 

00:05:53.310 --> 00:06:03.360
 fillon I have a small cardboard card 

00:05:59.729 --> 00:06:05.630
 for a long time we buy it from know the 

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:08.250
 neighborhood in there I still have the 

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:09.810
 little customers for the map he made himself 

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:11.940
 under the tail did not know what is it 

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:13.590
 and then you're a student you know at 

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:15.360
 Quebec to whom it's worth so much 

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:17.490
 it seems like it was all over 

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:19.470
 in all the stores behind 

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:22.260
 that he takes away without buying back a small 

00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:23.880
 friend who's ugly victoria's secret 

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:24.930
 is I think he bought or pink 

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:27.000
 victoria's secret 

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:30.510
 so it's really worth it 

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:34.110
 beautiful back bling cht the hall said 

00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:38.970

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:43.680
 plug in next thing I find 

00:06:38.970 --> 00:06:45.960
 my cream and food hundreds of burri 

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:49.130
 I like it because even though I speak 

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:52.010
 perfume myself if I think perfect 

00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:54.389
 so stocks it not too much honor 

00:06:52.010 --> 00:06:56.160
 but without a voice anyway but she has 

00:06:54.389 --> 00:07:00.440
 not too much of art so even if I think 

00:06:56.160 --> 00:07:03.720
 perfume it's perfect I have a pencil and 

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:05.940
 of the forum so during their training 

00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:08.760
 that we had had the mode so had 

00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:10.889
 that's it and benefit ok I 'm going 

00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:16.110
 really that's all and I have in my 

00:07:10.889 --> 00:07:20.310
 bag so raining a lie and a 

00:07:16.110 --> 00:07:23.070
 key so my key I instructed gmac a 

00:07:20.310 --> 00:07:28.409
 house then brekky at the moment 

00:07:23.070 --> 00:07:29.849
 it was one that my father had brought back to me 

00:07:28.409 --> 00:07:35.310
 father brought me back from mexico 

00:07:29.849 --> 00:07:38.090
 which shared m who was I 

00:07:35.310 --> 00:07:41.760
 thought of them three weeks in mexico 

00:07:38.090 --> 00:07:44.070
 mister then back is that from 

00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:45.570
 face the dates in what is in 

00:07:44.070 --> 00:07:50.280
 the den of fact by using I 

00:07:45.570 --> 00:07:52.980
 think anyway I think 

00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:54.389
 it's my door to key so it's 

00:07:52.980 --> 00:07:57.870
 really now everything that is 

00:07:54.389 --> 00:07:59.280
 really left like power I 

00:07:57.870 --> 00:08:02.910
 Trolling not much that I 

00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:04.680
 would find for me I'll be a little bit of 

00:08:02.910 --> 00:08:06.570
 things that compared there are a lot 

00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:08.340
 many others no but I hope 

00:08:06.570 --> 00:08:12.800
 that he needed more as video then 

00:08:08.340 --> 00:08:12.800
