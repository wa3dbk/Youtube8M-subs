00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:38.630
 Easter people associate chocolate is 

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:40.820
 What are you going to do for us today, then? 

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:44.090
 people are going to make a new spoon that is 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:45.680
 all stuffed with different brigadeiro 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:47.239
 that everybody likes in the brigadeiro and 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:49.340
 possible bet in the stadium brigadeiro 

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:50.570
 to be served one day indeed 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:52.760
 Let's start what we will need 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:55.820
 so to start we will need 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:57.380
 of 500 grams of milk chocolate and 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:59.210
 Noble chocolate, then we go. 

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:01.100
 need to breathe chocolate 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:03.860
 We'll take it in the microwave for a 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:05.810
 minute on average power 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:08.120
 Then we'll see if chocolate metal 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:09.979
 melted if not that there we do 

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:11.479
 in order to prevent it burn 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:13.010
 if you see that you still need it but 

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:15.670
 who takes the most time on the team in this 

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:15.670
 Monday 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:24.200
 the melted chocolate and now here 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.329
 He'll be more or less in the 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.950
 temperature of 45 degrees 

00:01:26.329 --> 00:01:29.659
 So we're going to have to download your 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:31.729
 temperature why we say 

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:33.110
 he took all the butters they had and 

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:35.000
 that we now have to put these 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:37.100
 particles is in this process of 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.539
 The temperament that we will do is only 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:39.679
 give a stir to take away all 

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:43.310
 groups 

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:46.009
 then he is already well well retired 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:54.590
 drawing and we will play in the stone 

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:56.479
 marble but the point here is you get a 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:58.729
 toothpick put on the lip 

00:01:56.479 --> 00:01:59.810
 lower you will feel a sensation of 

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:02.030
 cold 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:03.649
 so when you get that cold feeling 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:05.539
 to edit at the point and you 

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:09.640
 chocolate noticed that Maria is from 

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:09.640
 professional, that's the way it is not to go wrong 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:16.910
 Good, now we'll go through a 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:19.640
 container to make it easier for people 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:21.110
 to work and we'll start at 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:24.170
 process that we will use a 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:25.819
 Easter Egg Chocolate Mash 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:27.530
 of 500 grams 

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:31.430
 ok then we will make the first 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:34.239
 layer of hearing as we play the 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:34.239
 chocolate inside 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:42.030
 We're going to take the freezer for five 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:46.319
 little 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:49.880
 come on now love you 

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:52.560
 We already go to the second layer 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:54.360
 after that he will repeat this 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:59.040
 process will have done with five more 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:03:00.660
 and stuffing so we 're a 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:04.430
 second layer we will repeat 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:04.430
 again five minutes in the freezer 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:11.250
 so after five minutes now 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:12.660
 We'll fill it, I 'll prepare it. 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:16.380
 came in full of traditional joke 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:19.170
 that is so all that goal I think 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:21.120
 We 'll see, it 's traditional, the people. 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:22.680
 will make the first hand as if it were the 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:24.540
 layer of chocolate we'll do 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:26.550
 this layer of brigadier 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:28.080
 it is important also that is not a 

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:31.560
 He has a lot of oil, he has to give 

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:34.290
 a consistency for you to leave 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:37.440
 by the way , that's when I'm going to do it 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:40.080
 now you there that part with another 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:42.390
 layer of chocolate meeting part 

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:45.150
 that intention or make the egg of spoon 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:47.930

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:51.030
 We are going to give another sweetheart 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:53.450
 it can spread while there is a 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:53.450
 thin layer 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:58.670
 we will take now but not as 

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:58.670
