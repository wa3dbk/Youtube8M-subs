00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:07.250
 I do not hope so 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:17.030
 well then we only do a prey like that 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:21.840
 then we go back 

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:24.870
 click this folder for a long time then 

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:29.420
 click on copy then you go 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:32.130
 back back back 

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:33.870
 at minecraft it's always that way 

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:43.800
 whole world now everything is stored 

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:51.470
 on games is here you come up there 

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:51.470
 I did it wrong 

00:04:56.180 --> 00:05:03.210
 Now let's go to this map here 

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:07.140
 Minecraft will only minecraft as 

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:08.430
 backup goes on minecraft world of the world 

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:15.500

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:15.500
 have ne then it goes out insert 

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:25.270
 that's it and that's what it was for 

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:27.210
 You have to be clearly closed 

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:29.500
 be grating 

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:31.240
 otherwise this works best too 

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:33.550

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:41.740
