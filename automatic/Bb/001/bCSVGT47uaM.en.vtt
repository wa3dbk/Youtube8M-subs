when i was trying on my own i found a
skeleton<00:02:42.690> to<00:02:43.050> so<00:02:43.530> i'll<00:02:44.250> know<00:02:44.460> which<00:02:44.640> mob<00:02:44.880> mobs

the spawn regularly regularly but it is

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:52.730 
the spawn regularly regularly but it is
sure<00:02:50.070> to<00:02:50.250> avoid<00:02:50.400> variety<00:02:51.150> also<00:02:51.780> it<00:02:52.200> kind<00:02:52.680> of

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:52.740 
sure to avoid variety also it kind of

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:56.690 
sure to avoid variety also it kind of
explodes<00:02:53.190> but<00:02:53.910> went<00:02:54.770> by<00:02:55.770> you<00:02:55.830> rate<00:02:56.340> the<00:02:56.490> tube

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
explodes but went by you rate the tube

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:00.470 
explodes but went by you rate the tube
and<00:02:56.910> it<00:02:57.690> will<00:02:57.930> drop<00:02:58.140> loot<00:02:58.680> ok<00:02:59.610> last<00:02:59.820> one<00:02:59.940> here

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
and it will drop loot ok last one here

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:05.090 
and it will drop loot ok last one here
because<00:03:00.780> i'm<00:03:00.960> just<00:03:00.990> curious<00:03:01.350> about<00:03:01.590> smart<00:03:04.100> let

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:05.100 
because i'm just curious about smart let

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:08.210 
because i'm just curious about smart let
me<00:03:05.220> kill<00:03:05.400> the<00:03:05.520> zombie<00:03:05.820> and<00:03:06.470> ya<00:03:07.470> know<00:03:07.620> dude<00:03:07.950> but

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
me kill the zombie and ya know dude but

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:11.600 
me kill the zombie and ya know dude but
it's<00:03:09.120> probably<00:03:09.990> a<00:03:10.230> depend<00:03:11.010> depending<00:03:11.340> on<00:03:11.490> this

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:11.610 
it's probably a depend depending on this

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:13.460 
it's probably a depend depending on this
situation<00:03:11.880> because<00:03:12.510> i<00:03:12.720> was<00:03:13.020> getting<00:03:13.320> good

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470 
situation because i was getting good

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:17.510 
situation because i was getting good
before<00:03:13.980> so<00:03:14.790> the<00:03:15.000> crypt<00:03:15.240> has<00:03:16.200> a<00:03:16.230> key<00:03:16.500> and<00:03:16.650> I

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:17.520 
before so the crypt has a key and I

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:19.310 
before so the crypt has a key and I
don't<00:03:17.700> have<00:03:17.850> the<00:03:17.970> key<00:03:18.120> calabro<00:03:18.660> block<00:03:19.080> or

blocks can I break this no I can't as

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:23.510 
blocks can I break this no I can't as
you<00:03:22.110> guess<00:03:22.260> I<00:03:22.380> can't<00:03:22.590> break<00:03:22.770> this<00:03:22.890> and<00:03:23.160> I<00:03:23.280> can't

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:23.520 
you guess I can't break this and I can't

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:25.280 
you guess I can't break this and I can't
break<00:03:23.640> the<00:03:23.820> steel<00:03:24.030> stairs<00:03:24.570> as<00:03:24.690> well<00:03:24.900> I<00:03:25.050> cannot

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290 
break the steel stairs as well I cannot

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:27.800 
break the steel stairs as well I cannot
touch<00:03:25.500> the<00:03:25.560> Crypt<00:03:25.890> so<00:03:26.820> what<00:03:27.060> shall<00:03:27.240> you<00:03:27.510> what

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:27.810 
touch the Crypt so what shall you what

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:32.990 
touch the Crypt so what shall you what
shall<00:03:28.020> I<00:03:28.080> do<00:03:28.200> hmm<00:03:29.630> let's<00:03:30.630> see<00:03:30.750> Oh<00:03:31.310> Oh<00:03:32.310> what's

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 
shall I do hmm let's see Oh Oh what's

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.140 
shall I do hmm let's see Oh Oh what's
all<00:03:33.090> over<00:03:33.210> there<00:03:33.500> what<00:03:34.500> is<00:03:34.650> this<00:03:34.800> thing<00:03:35.010> oh<00:03:35.280> I

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.150 
all over there what is this thing oh I

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:38.870 
all over there what is this thing oh I
think<00:03:36.930> it<00:03:37.200> can<00:03:37.440> contain<00:03:37.800> the<00:03:37.920> key<00:03:38.130> to<00:03:38.790> the

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:38.880 
think it can contain the key to the

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:45.110 
think it can contain the key to the
Crypt<00:03:39.090> so<00:03:39.990> let<00:03:40.320> me<00:03:41.150> break<00:03:42.150> into<00:03:42.360> distinct<00:03:44.120> it

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:45.120 
Crypt so let me break into distinct it

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:48.590 
Crypt so let me break into distinct it
can<00:03:45.990> take<00:03:46.170> some<00:03:46.440> time<00:03:47.040> as<00:03:47.550> this<00:03:48.120> is<00:03:48.300> obsidian
