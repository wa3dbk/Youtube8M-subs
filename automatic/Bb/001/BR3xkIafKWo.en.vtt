going to go ahead and throw up another
card<00:01:39.270> out<00:01:39.420> there<00:01:39.630> that's<00:01:39.990> gonna<00:01:40.140> function<00:01:40.409> as

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
card out there that's gonna function as

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:44.120 
card out there that's gonna function as
my<00:01:41.610> scoreboard<00:01:42.150> ok<00:01:42.990> so<00:01:43.049> now<00:01:43.290> I<00:01:43.320> have<00:01:43.409> my<00:01:43.770> whole

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
my scoreboard ok so now I have my whole

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.030 
my scoreboard ok so now I have my whole
environment<00:01:44.780> setup<00:01:45.780> ok<00:01:46.500> so<00:01:46.560> we<00:01:46.710> now<00:01:46.829> that<00:01:46.950> we

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
environment setup ok so we now that we

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.469 
environment setup ok so we now that we
have<00:01:47.070> our<00:01:47.189> stadium<00:01:47.670> we<00:01:47.790> have<00:01:47.820> our<00:01:48.149> our

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
have our stadium we have our our

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:49.639 
have our stadium we have our our
environment<00:01:48.990> let's<00:01:49.110> go<00:01:49.229> ahead<00:01:49.350> and<00:01:49.470> let's

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
environment let's go ahead and let's

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.530 
environment let's go ahead and let's
start<00:01:49.890> playing<00:01:50.130> soccer<00:01:50.399> so<00:01:50.939> you<00:01:51.360> can<00:01:51.509> actually

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
start playing soccer so you can actually

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.139 
start playing soccer so you can actually
play<00:01:51.960> two<00:01:52.020> player<00:01:52.229> ad<00:01:53.100> hoc<00:01:53.430> or<00:01:53.640> through

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
play two player ad hoc or through

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:56.179 
play two player ad hoc or through
infrastructure<00:01:54.299> as<00:01:54.720> well<00:01:54.750> so<00:01:55.409> you<00:01:55.500> to<00:01:55.890> beat<00:01:56.070> as

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
infrastructure as well so you to beat as

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.520 
infrastructure as well so you to beat as
one<00:01:56.219> set<00:01:56.640> of<00:01:56.729> cards<00:01:57.030> and<00:01:57.180> then<00:01:57.659> the<00:01:58.020> experience

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
one set of cards and then the experience

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.440 
one set of cards and then the experience
is<00:01:58.680> however<00:01:58.890> you<00:01:59.369> mean<00:01:59.640> you<00:02:00.000> maneuver<00:02:00.360> around

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
is however you mean you maneuver around

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.539 
is however you mean you maneuver around
the<00:02:00.719> playing<00:02:00.960> field<00:02:01.229> it<00:02:01.680> remembers<00:02:02.009> where<00:02:02.430> the

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
the playing field it remembers where the

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:04.340 
the playing field it remembers where the
cards<00:02:02.909> are<00:02:03.090> so<00:02:03.570> you<00:02:03.659> can<00:02:03.869> go<00:02:03.990> ahead<00:02:04.049> and<00:02:04.170> zoom

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
cards are so you can go ahead and zoom

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:05.130 
cards are so you can go ahead and zoom
in

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:05.140 
in

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:06.719 
in
and<00:02:05.260> get<00:02:05.500> really<00:02:05.740> close<00:02:05.890> to<00:02:06.040> the<00:02:06.070> field<00:02:06.370> zoom

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:06.729 
and get really close to the field zoom

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:09.120 
and get really close to the field zoom
back<00:02:06.940> out<00:02:07.180> and<00:02:07.510> then<00:02:08.020> it<00:02:08.590> keeps<00:02:08.890> everything

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:09.130 
back out and then it keeps everything

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:11.130 
back out and then it keeps everything
within<00:02:09.580> context<00:02:10.270> within<00:02:10.479> the<00:02:10.720> context<00:02:11.080> of

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:11.140 
within context within the context of

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:13.020 
within context within the context of
playing<00:02:11.410> field<00:02:11.620> so<00:02:12.010> as<00:02:12.190> you<00:02:12.310> can<00:02:12.430> see<00:02:12.640> it

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
playing field so as you can see it

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:15.930 
playing field so as you can see it
actually<00:02:13.330> does<00:02:13.510> it<00:02:14.080> does<00:02:14.350> factor<00:02:14.620> in<00:02:15.069> the<00:02:15.640> size

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:15.940 
actually does it does factor in the size

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:18.240 
actually does it does factor in the size
of<00:02:16.270> the<00:02:16.330> playing<00:02:16.630> space<00:02:16.959> it<00:02:17.350> factors<00:02:17.590> in<00:02:17.980> the

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250 
of the playing space it factors in the

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:20.040 
of the playing space it factors in the
velocity<00:02:18.910> of<00:02:18.940> out<00:02:19.150> where<00:02:19.510> you<00:02:19.630> touch<00:02:19.780> into<00:02:19.900> how

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:20.050 
velocity of out where you touch into how

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:21.690 
velocity of out where you touch into how
you<00:02:20.110> touch<00:02:20.410> it<00:02:20.590> and<00:02:20.740> you<00:02:21.100> can<00:02:21.190> do<00:02:21.250> all<00:02:21.280> kinds<00:02:21.400> of

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:21.700 
you touch it and you can do all kinds of

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:23.010 
you touch it and you can do all kinds of
really<00:02:21.850> crazy<00:02:22.060> things<00:02:22.390> too<00:02:22.570> like<00:02:22.750> you<00:02:22.870> can

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:23.020 
really crazy things too like you can

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:26.370 
really crazy things too like you can
actually<00:02:23.160> you<00:02:24.160> know<00:02:24.250> swipe<00:02:24.760> men<00:02:25.000> in<00:02:25.209> in<00:02:25.450> half

actually you know swipe men in in half

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:28.530 
actually you know swipe men in in half
circles<00:02:26.830> and<00:02:26.950> have<00:02:27.100> them<00:02:27.220> run<00:02:27.850> around<00:02:28.000> guys<00:02:28.390> so
