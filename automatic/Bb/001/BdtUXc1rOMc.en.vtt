00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:05.220
 hello friends, we are going to prepare you to do 

00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:09.219
 an express chocolate sponge cake 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:11.350
 we need 10 eggs an envelope 

00:00:09.219 --> 00:00:17.860
 yeast 

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:20.860
 Natural chocolate sunflower oil 

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:20.860
 sugar 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:26.349
 matilla for games 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:45.490
 powdered 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.830
 dreaming is not quantified 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:02.170
 ah 

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:07.750
 It is natural without breaking the image 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:12.310
 we will do it 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:14.700
 with a spoonful but the container to 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:14.700
 save 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:19.840
 and we keep it because we're going to 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:19.840
 do 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:41.020
 and now half based on wolves not 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:44.130
 we will reach rivers 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:44.130
 normal karina 

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:53.119
 exact 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:56.440
 ah 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:06.560
 up to the note 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:11.410
 the exact amounts 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:14.599
 or 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:27.240
 it's more and a half 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:27.240
 and sugar 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:32.530
 one more up 

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:47.580
 had elderly 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:59.700
 now again milk was connected 

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:59.700
 container and one up 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:25.080
 content with a paper 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:36.090
 but with a little battery either 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:36.090
 of everything 

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:44.740
 to 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:50.400
 i 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:54.790
 good 

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:59.650
 I have seen once reaching this point 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:11.230
 for its completion 

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:17.049
 We see the aspect you have chosen and 

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:19.209
 same 

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:21.609
 once in the microwave we will put it to 

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:24.599
 maximum power and as we did during 

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:24.599
 nine minutes 

00:04:56.060 --> 00:05:00.930
 single 

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:00.930
 I'll give 

00:05:01.009 --> 00:05:06.909
 and here we have our 2008 

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:09.970
 ah 

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:13.810
 we are going now 

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:23.569
 i 

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:30.470
 two 

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:38.860
 we put any dish on top of another 

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:38.860
 container and we return it to 

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:46.200
 ah 

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:51.870
 so that we remove the plastic that 

00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:54.120
 we had put the vegetable paper for 

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:56.600
 we will not stick 

00:05:54.120 --> 00:06:00.440
 if we let go a little bit to cool down 

00:05:56.600 --> 00:06:00.440
 better now good 

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:04.200
 it does not matter 

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:10.680
 we remove them and here we have the same 

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:10.680
 Biscuit 

00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:18.420
 any of these for dessert without 

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:25.840
 to have presented it so quickly 

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:28.770
 after having done that as I still 

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:28.770
 is throwing steam 

00:06:29.849 --> 00:06:34.200
 boots and put me on top 

00:06:32.099 --> 00:06:36.610
 to melt 

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:39.100
 and it will be 

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:40.900
 especially 

00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:43.950
 we could also have thrown in the 

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:48.630
 house had melted 

00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:48.630
 But so 

00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:55.080
 I hope you liked it and that what 

00:06:53.910 --> 00:06:57.590
 put into practice 

00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:57.590
 a greeting
