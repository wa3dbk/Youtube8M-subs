00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
smaller than bigger because it really

there's no paint on the buckle so you're
not<00:01:58.530> cutting<00:01:58.860> the<00:01:58.920> buckle<00:01:59.219> I<00:01:59.310> like<00:01:59.490> the<00:01:59.640> hands

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
not cutting the buckle I like the hands

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.459 
not cutting the buckle I like the hands
except<00:02:00.360> for<00:02:00.509> the<00:02:00.570> fact<00:02:00.780> that<00:02:01.079> there's<00:02:01.259> no

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
except for the fact that there's no

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:03.130 
except for the fact that there's no
articulation<00:02:02.070> so<00:02:02.189> you<00:02:02.280> can't<00:02:02.520> make<00:02:02.640> a<00:02:02.700> fist

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:03.140 
articulation so you can't make a fist

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:06.350 
articulation so you can't make a fist
and<00:02:04.140> Steve<00:02:04.770> Rogers<00:02:05.130> isn't<00:02:05.790> known<00:02:05.969> for<00:02:06.270> using

and Steve Rogers isn't known for using
guns<00:02:06.719> really<00:02:06.990> so<00:02:07.380> it's<00:02:07.530> kind<00:02:07.710> of<00:02:07.740> a<00:02:07.860> problem

00:02:09.339 --> 00:02:09.349 
guns really so it's kind of a problem

while we're on the subject the guns

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:14.620 
while we're on the subject the guns
are<00:02:12.560> pretty<00:02:13.070> junky<00:02:13.400> I<00:02:13.580> think<00:02:13.970> they<00:02:14.360> look<00:02:14.510> like

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:14.630 
are pretty junky I think they look like

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:17.230 
are pretty junky I think they look like
knockoff<00:02:15.140> GI<00:02:15.560> Joe<00:02:15.860> guns<00:02:16.130> they<00:02:16.910> don't<00:02:17.120> look

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:17.240 
knockoff GI Joe guns they don't look

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:19.420 
knockoff GI Joe guns they don't look
realistic<00:02:17.930> and<00:02:18.260> they're<00:02:18.650> there's<00:02:18.980> no<00:02:19.130> paint

to them at all they're just solid silver

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:24.210 
to them at all they're just solid silver
and<00:02:21.700> they<00:02:22.700> break<00:02:22.970> too<00:02:23.240> apparently

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:54.380 
painted I don't know if they're supposed

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:56.050 
painted I don't know if they're supposed
to<00:02:54.440> be<00:02:54.560> connected<00:02:55.010> or<00:02:55.130> not<00:02:55.310> if<00:02:55.640> they're<00:02:55.910> not

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:56.060 
to be connected or not if they're not

supposed<00:02:56.510> to<00:02:56.600> be<00:02:56.720> connected<00:02:57.080> then<00:02:57.170> this<00:02:57.320> is

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:57.500 
supposed to be connected then this is

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:59.740 
supposed to be connected then this is
accurate<00:02:57.740> it's<00:02:58.550> just<00:02:58.760> a<00:02:58.850> really<00:02:59.090> weird<00:02:59.330> design

00:02:59.740 --> 00:02:59.750 
accurate it's just a really weird design

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:01.360 
accurate it's just a really weird design
because<00:03:00.080> those<00:03:00.230> are<00:03:00.350> kind<00:03:00.710> of<00:03:00.770> silly<00:03:00.980> straps

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:01.370 
because those are kind of silly straps

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:05.650 
because those are kind of silly straps
but<00:03:02.320> they<00:03:03.320> are<00:03:03.500> what<00:03:03.650> they<00:03:03.770> are<00:03:03.800> so<00:03:04.610> at<00:03:05.570> least

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:05.660 
but they are what they are so at least

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:08.320 
but they are what they are so at least
the<00:03:05.840> buckles<00:03:06.170> are<00:03:06.290> painted<00:03:06.650> I<00:03:06.710> guess<00:03:06.950> I<00:03:07.330> want

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:08.330 
the buckles are painted I guess I want

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:09.700 
the buckles are painted I guess I want
to<00:03:08.360> also<00:03:08.510> mention<00:03:08.720> there's<00:03:09.020> no<00:03:09.140> shading<00:03:09.440> on

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:09.710 
to also mention there's no shading on

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:11.860 
to also mention there's no shading on
the<00:03:09.830> black<00:03:10.130> so<00:03:10.970> let's<00:03:11.180> another<00:03:11.420> lock<00:03:11.690> down

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:11.870 
the black so let's another lock down

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:14.020 
the black so let's another lock down
this<00:03:12.530> arm<00:03:12.830> is<00:03:13.130> even<00:03:13.520> worse<00:03:13.640> than<00:03:13.670> the<00:03:13.850> other

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:14.030 
this arm is even worse than the other

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:15.850 
this arm is even worse than the other
side<00:03:14.300> because<00:03:14.480> the<00:03:14.990> arm<00:03:15.350> doesn't<00:03:15.620> actually

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:15.860 
side because the arm doesn't actually

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:19.570 
side because the arm doesn't actually
meet<00:03:16.580> where<00:03:17.209> the<00:03:17.380> wrists<00:03:18.380> swivel<00:03:18.800> is<00:03:18.980> there's

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:19.580 
meet where the wrists swivel is there's

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:21.820 
meet where the wrists swivel is there's
a<00:03:19.670> gap<00:03:19.850> there<00:03:20.150> and<00:03:20.360> it's<00:03:21.140> not<00:03:21.290> just<00:03:21.500> on<00:03:21.620> mine

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:21.830 
a gap there and it's not just on mine

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:23.410 
a gap there and it's not just on mine
I've<00:03:22.040> seen<00:03:22.220> it<00:03:22.340> on<00:03:22.400> other<00:03:22.459> people's<00:03:23.000> as<00:03:23.150> well

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:23.420 
I've seen it on other people's as well

for being Steve Rogers they really

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:33.760 
for being Steve Rogers they really
should<00:04:32.000> have<00:04:32.030> spent<00:04:32.270> some<00:04:32.389> time<00:04:32.630> on<00:04:32.660> it<00:04:33.050> give

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:33.770 
should have spent some time on it give

should have spent some time on it give

the<00:04:45.590> heads<00:04:45.800> too<00:04:45.979> big<00:04:46.009> and<00:04:46.520> ugly<00:04:46.639> and<00:04:48.250> these<00:04:49.250> are

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:49.400 
the heads too big and ugly and these are

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:50.950 
the heads too big and ugly and these are
pretty<00:04:49.550> ugly<00:04:49.759> even<00:04:50.210> though<00:04:50.300> they<00:04:50.419> do<00:04:50.479> have<00:04:50.599> the

pretty ugly even though they do have the

pretty ugly even though they do have the
buckles<00:04:51.319> painted<00:04:51.740> they're<00:04:52.310> still<00:04:52.610> just<00:04:52.639> kind

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:53.000 
buckles painted they're still just kind

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.689 
buckles painted they're still just kind
of<00:04:53.120> kind<00:04:53.720> of<00:04:53.780> bad-looking<00:04:54.349> the<00:04:55.160> shield<00:04:55.460> is

00:04:55.689 --> 00:04:55.699 
of kind of bad-looking the shield is

00:04:55.699 --> 00:04:57.900 
of kind of bad-looking the shield is
nice<00:04:55.970> though<00:04:56.180> it's<00:04:56.330> a<00:04:56.389> nice<00:04:56.539> solid<00:04:56.780> plastic

00:04:57.900 --> 00:04:57.910 
nice though it's a nice solid plastic

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:00.520 
nice though it's a nice solid plastic
with<00:04:58.910> the<00:04:58.940> translucent<00:04:59.930> version<00:05:00.380> which

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:00.530 
with the translucent version which

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:02.800 
with the translucent version which
obviously<00:05:01.130> this<00:05:01.370> is<00:05:01.580> is<00:05:01.880> done<00:05:02.180> well<00:05:02.419> so<00:05:02.720> I'm

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:02.810 
obviously this is is done well so I'm

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:03.460 
obviously this is is done well so I'm
okay<00:05:03.080> with<00:05:03.110> that

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:03.470 
okay with that

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:05.620 
okay with that
it<00:05:04.070> does<00:05:04.250> clip<00:05:04.490> onto<00:05:04.669> the<00:05:04.910> wrist<00:05:05.120> and<00:05:05.360> you<00:05:05.509> can

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:05.630 
it does clip onto the wrist and you can

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:07.510 
it does clip onto the wrist and you can
fold<00:05:05.810> it<00:05:05.900> down<00:05:06.080> and<00:05:06.259> PEG<00:05:06.410> it<00:05:06.560> into<00:05:06.919> the<00:05:07.220> flight

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:07.520 
fold it down and PEG it into the flight

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:09.790 
fold it down and PEG it into the flight
stand<00:05:07.820> hole<00:05:08.060> in<00:05:08.210> his<00:05:08.330> back<00:05:08.560> although<00:05:09.560> being

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:09.800 
stand hole in his back although being

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:11.980 
stand hole in his back although being
this<00:05:10.070> version<00:05:10.789> that's<00:05:11.120> not<00:05:11.509> very<00:05:11.750> realistic

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:11.990 
this version that's not very realistic

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:14.170 
this version that's not very realistic
so<00:05:12.560> you<00:05:13.460> should<00:05:13.610> just<00:05:13.759> leave<00:05:13.880> it<00:05:14.030> like<00:05:14.150> that

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:14.180 
so you should just leave it like that

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:16.450 
so you should just leave it like that
you<00:05:14.840> wouldn't<00:05:15.080> have<00:05:15.229> the<00:05:15.410> photon<00:05:15.830> shield<00:05:16.130> on

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:16.460 
you wouldn't have the photon shield on

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:19.600 
you wouldn't have the photon shield on
his<00:05:16.520> back<00:05:17.470> but<00:05:18.470> it<00:05:18.560> is<00:05:18.650> done<00:05:18.889> well<00:05:19.099> it<00:05:19.280> has<00:05:19.400> some

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:19.610 
his back but it is done well it has some

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:22.839 
his back but it is done well it has some
rivets<00:05:19.940> sculpted<00:05:20.509> on<00:05:20.630> there<00:05:20.990> and<00:05:21.849> actually

00:05:22.839 --> 00:05:22.849 
rivets sculpted on there and actually

00:05:22.849 --> 00:05:24.700 
rivets sculpted on there and actually
that's<00:05:23.090> kind<00:05:23.300> of<00:05:23.389> silly<00:05:23.659> because<00:05:24.590> there

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:24.710 
that's kind of silly because there

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:26.140 
that's kind of silly because there
wouldn't<00:05:24.860> be<00:05:24.949> rivets<00:05:25.310> on<00:05:25.460> this<00:05:25.639> version<00:05:25.880> so

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:26.150 
wouldn't be rivets on this version so

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:27.550 
wouldn't be rivets on this version so
it's<00:05:26.300> just<00:05:26.389> the<00:05:26.509> same<00:05:26.539> mold<00:05:26.990> as<00:05:27.050> the<00:05:27.229> regular

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:27.560 
it's just the same mold as the regular

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:30.040 
it's just the same mold as the regular
version<00:05:27.830> but<00:05:28.789> clearer<00:05:29.090> so<00:05:29.300> it's<00:05:29.419> kind<00:05:29.599> of<00:05:29.690> bad

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:30.050 
version but clearer so it's kind of bad

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:31.480 
version but clearer so it's kind of bad
actually<00:05:30.560> now<00:05:30.650> that<00:05:30.710> I<00:05:30.830> think<00:05:30.860> about<00:05:31.099> it<00:05:31.370> so

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:31.490 
actually now that I think about it so

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:33.999 
actually now that I think about it so
it's<00:05:31.610> another<00:05:31.789> thing<00:05:32.030> I<00:05:32.090> don't<00:05:32.180> like<00:05:32.740> bummer<00:05:33.740> I

00:05:33.999 --> 00:05:34.009 
it's another thing I don't like bummer I

00:05:34.009 --> 00:05:36.520 
it's another thing I don't like bummer I

00:05:39.969 --> 00:05:39.979 
it's a good looking figure and if it

00:05:39.979 --> 00:05:41.589 
it's a good looking figure and if it
wasn't<00:05:40.310> for<00:05:40.430> all<00:05:40.460> the<00:05:40.699> things<00:05:40.909> that<00:05:41.180> we<00:05:41.389> know

00:05:41.589 --> 00:05:41.599 
wasn't for all the things that we know

00:05:41.599 --> 00:05:43.450 
wasn't for all the things that we know
should<00:05:41.930> have<00:05:41.960> been<00:05:42.229> on<00:05:42.349> there<00:05:42.650> I'd<00:05:43.039> say<00:05:43.099> it's<00:05:43.430> a

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:43.460 
should have been on there I'd say it's a

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:46.300 
should have been on there I'd say it's a
great<00:05:43.669> figure<00:05:43.940> but<00:05:44.650> since<00:05:45.650> it's<00:05:45.830> not<00:05:46.009> what<00:05:46.219> it

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:46.310 
great figure but since it's not what it
