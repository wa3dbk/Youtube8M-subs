the nail tech and dragging the wet side
towards<00:01:02.329> me<00:01:02.510> in<00:01:02.719> the<00:01:02.870> center<00:01:03.199> of<00:01:03.320> the<00:01:03.410> powder

towards me in the center of the powder

00:01:03.679 --> 00:01:06.359 
towards me in the center of the powder
is<00:01:03.859> important<00:01:04.340> because<00:01:04.850> you<00:01:05.269> don't<00:01:05.449> want<00:01:05.540> to

00:01:06.359 --> 00:01:06.369 
is important because you don't want to

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:09.670 
is important because you don't want to
use<00:01:07.369> the<00:01:07.640> dry<00:01:08.000> side<00:01:08.360> and<00:01:08.689> drag<00:01:09.080> it<00:01:09.229> towards<00:01:09.590> you

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:09.680 
use the dry side and drag it towards you

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:11.410 
use the dry side and drag it towards you
you<00:01:09.890> need<00:01:10.040> good<00:01:10.220> product<00:01:10.670> consistency<00:01:11.299> and

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:11.420 
you need good product consistency and

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:13.120 
you need good product consistency and
you<00:01:11.600> never<00:01:11.930> want<00:01:12.200> to<00:01:12.259> touch<00:01:12.439> the<00:01:12.619> sides<00:01:12.860> of<00:01:13.009> the

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:13.130 
you never want to touch the sides of the

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:15.010 
you never want to touch the sides of the
containers<00:01:13.729> because<00:01:13.909> if<00:01:14.240> you<00:01:14.330> do<00:01:14.509> that<00:01:14.720> it

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:15.020 
containers because if you do that it

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:17.740 
containers because if you do that it
drains<00:01:15.799> into<00:01:16.100> the<00:01:16.430> container<00:01:17.000> and<00:01:17.240> hardens<00:01:17.630> up

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:17.750 
drains into the container and hardens up

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:19.990 
drains into the container and hardens up
on<00:01:17.930> the<00:01:18.020> side<00:01:18.229> and<00:01:18.530> it<00:01:19.009> looks<00:01:19.250> really<00:01:19.340> dirty

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:20.000 
on the side and it looks really dirty

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.749 
on the side and it looks really dirty
and<00:01:20.409> your<00:01:21.409> perceived<00:01:21.740> value<00:01:21.979> is<00:01:22.340> not<00:01:22.490> very

00:01:22.749 --> 00:01:22.759 
and your perceived value is not very

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:24.670 
and your perceived value is not very
good<00:01:22.820> then<00:01:23.150> so<00:01:23.930> here<00:01:24.140> we<00:01:24.229> go<00:01:24.259> we're<00:01:24.470> going<00:01:24.590> to

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:24.680
