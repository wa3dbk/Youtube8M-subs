00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:11.080
 Hello everyone today I want to tell 

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:12.550
 you do a randat side flip 

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:14.340
 this flip is very simple to use 

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:16.380
 if a 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:19.700
 you know how to make some kind of connection she 

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:23.240
 pint side rent so 

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:25.760
 easier who knows how to lead from the cross to 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:27.960
 principle the same principle but 

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:29.560
 we are 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.460
 tell you later 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:32.460
 and what I will tell about 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:38.640
 it would be good to do 

00:00:35.589 --> 00:00:40.920
 back here 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:44.710
 in principle, this is the same as for 1 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:48.820
 articles we undermine us 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:50.829
 but here is a slightly different principle if 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:52.840
 who can not do it can be possible 

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:55.840
 through the back flip with a random 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:58.629
 that is, jump back somersault stock then 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:01.780
 takes place at the end we will be so 

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:03.870
 easier who did not understand here is the trend back 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:03.870
 flip 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:11.830
 if we want to learn through the back 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:14.080
 side flips we just try at the end 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:16.030
 when vacation comes then when we 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:18.450
 letting go of the grouping we turn around 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:18.450
 and 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:28.940
 grouping turned around 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.150
 further we should and constantly 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:33.920
 train this element 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:37.610
 do it at speed try to jump 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:42.340
 him more often and then when we are already on 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:45.560
 learning to unfold after the rear 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:49.159
 we will try to jump set random 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:53.659
 randat sides to face looking into 

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:56.500
 side and jump already over the floor here 

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:56.500
 look 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.259
 this is a side randat 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:10.310
 need to remember that naked in no way 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:13.440
 case not to throw back and forth 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:14.099
 try to drag on sirin date like on 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.930
 screw floor 

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:17.930
 who can twist the screw and 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:24.790
 in the hands we just throw as well as 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:27.370
 back flip up just go here 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:28.709
 you are on the top and the side just doing 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:33.920
 ordinary slave 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:37.010
 tearing it off on our shoulders 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:40.430
 who learn him very easily from him 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:43.090
 do some kind of even elementary 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:43.090
 bundle and 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:03:02.599
 well creates inertia 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:02.599
 After side flips, try bye
