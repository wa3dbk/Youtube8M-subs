 plus I invite you to continue watching the 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:11.870
 here, how can you see me? 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:13.940
 I fixed my eyebrows so first thing 

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:15.620
 what I'm going to do is apply a base for 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:16.070
 that shadows and adhere very much 

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:18.049
 best 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:22.060
 I'm going to apply this cream concealer 

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:22.060
 and I'm going to spread it all over the eyelid 

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:29.200
 the next thing is to apply a black pencil 

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:31.210
 all over the mobile eyelid the line of 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:33.130
 the lower lashes and the line of 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:36.870
 upper and lower water so that we 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:36.870
 serve as the basis for the black shadow 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:44.210
 then he applied the shadow 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:46.630
 black over the pencil that ends 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:46.630
 Apply 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:54.740
 ah 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:57.149
 ah 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:59.469
 i 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:01.360
 then I will apply a shade color 

00:01:59.469 --> 00:02:03.810
 vanilla in the brow bone to 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:03.810
 to illuminate 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:12.290
 now I'm going to use this tone that is 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:16.590
 as a brick color but very clear 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:19.430
 and I'm going to apply it on top of the black 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:19.430
 ah 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:23.340
 ah 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:31.209
 then he applied a dark brown shadow and the 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:35.370
 I will place in the entire eye socket 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:35.370
 to blur the black shadow very well 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:38.640
 Y 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:41.970
 Y 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:49.239
 ah 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:51.519
 again take the black pencil and I'm going to 

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:55.049
 draw a tail on the lacrimal and what 

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:55.049
 I'm going to review with black shadow 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:59.690
 to 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:05.880
 and to finish with the eyes I'm going to 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:05.880
 apply lash 

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:11.349
 ah 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:18.120
 and now for the face I'm going to use 

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:18.120
 this base 

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:26.070
 ah 

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:26.070
 ah 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:29.940
 Y 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:34.750
 Y 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:38.620
 ah 

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:45.380
 and then to seal the base I'm going 

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:49.480
 to use this powder to contour a 

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:49.480
 little and I'm going to use this blush tone 

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:55.240
 ah 

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:59.690

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:04.450

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:09.640
 the law 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:21.880
 to finish I will apply this lip 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:24.690
 in a clear lilac tone since the eyes 

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:24.690
 they are so strong 

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:29.570
