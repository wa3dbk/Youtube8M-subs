caffeine<00:00:53.640> content<00:00:54.090> as<00:00:54.420> well<00:00:54.570> but<00:00:55.410> this<00:00:56.160> is<00:00:56.399> a

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
caffeine content as well but this is a

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.229 
caffeine content as well but this is a
performance<00:00:57.750> drink<00:00:58.699> they've<00:00:59.699> changed<00:00:59.940> it<00:01:00.090> to

performance drink they've changed it to
two<00:01:00.570> servings<00:01:01.050> instead<00:01:01.440> compared<00:01:01.949> to<00:01:02.039> the

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
two servings instead compared to the

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.130 
two servings instead compared to the
other<00:01:02.250> one<00:01:02.370> which<00:01:02.460> was<00:01:02.640> four<00:01:02.940> and<00:01:03.210> I'm<00:01:04.019> not

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
other one which was four and I'm not

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:05.270 
other one which was four and I'm not
gonna<00:01:04.260> lie

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
gonna lie

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.210

some<00:01:05.850> of<00:01:05.909> the<00:01:06.000> flavors<00:01:06.360> are<00:01:06.450> not<00:01:06.540> very<00:01:06.720> nice

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:07.220 
some of the flavors are not very nice

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:09.800 
some of the flavors are not very nice
but<00:01:08.220> I<00:01:08.250> guess<00:01:08.549> one<00:01:09.060> of<00:01:09.150> the<00:01:09.210> best<00:01:09.420> things<00:01:09.630> to

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
but I guess one of the best things to

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.130 
but I guess one of the best things to
compare<00:01:10.140> to<00:01:10.380> is<00:01:10.790> if<00:01:11.790> it<00:01:11.970> tastes<00:01:12.180> like<00:01:12.299> shit<00:01:12.689> or

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
compare to is if it tastes like shit or

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:14.840 
compare to is if it tastes like shit or
if<00:01:13.229> it's<00:01:13.350> got<00:01:13.470> side<00:01:13.680> effects<00:01:13.950> you<00:01:14.640> know<00:01:14.760> it

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
if it's got side effects you know it

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.320 
if it's got side effects you know it
works<00:01:15.090> so<00:01:16.310> basically<00:01:17.310> this<00:01:17.549> contains<00:01:18.000> aloe

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
works so basically this contains aloe

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.210 
works so basically this contains aloe
the<00:01:18.479> crazy<00:01:18.720> crap<00:01:19.110> it's<00:01:19.380> also<00:01:19.500> a<00:01:19.590> nitric<00:01:19.920> oxide

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
the crazy crap it's also a nitric oxide

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.340 
the crazy crap it's also a nitric oxide
formula<00:01:20.549> in<00:01:20.670> its<00:01:20.820> valve<00:01:21.030> which<00:01:21.720> is<00:01:21.930> like<00:01:22.140> they

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
formula in its valve which is like they

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.770 
formula in its valve which is like they
make<00:01:22.530> bitter<00:01:23.130> makes<00:01:23.460> no<00:01:23.580> explode<00:01:23.909> as<00:01:24.210> well<00:01:24.420> so
