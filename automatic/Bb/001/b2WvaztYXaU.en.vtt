00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:51.150 
for example the venom drug it was the

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:52.670 
for example the venom drug it was the
first<00:03:51.390> time<00:03:51.660> he'd<00:03:51.870> ever<00:03:51.959> run<00:03:52.200> across<00:03:52.290> it

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:52.680

rather<00:03:52.890> than<00:03:53.070> the<00:03:53.160> 80th<00:03:53.820> time<00:03:53.850> even<00:03:54.420> across<00:03:54.690> it

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:54.870 
rather than the 80th time even across it

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:56.840 
rather than the 80th time even across it
I'd<00:03:55.049> add<00:03:55.230> to<00:03:55.260> that<00:03:55.410> that<00:03:55.739> you<00:03:56.370> know<00:03:56.489> there<00:03:56.790> are

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:56.850 
I'd add to that that you know there are

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:58.340 
I'd add to that that you know there are
quite<00:03:56.940> a<00:03:57.000> few<00:03:57.060> other<00:03:57.269> comics<00:03:57.630> that<00:03:57.690> we<00:03:58.140> read

00:03:58.340 --> 00:03:58.350 
quite a few other comics that we read

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:00.080 
quite a few other comics that we read
and<00:03:58.380> especially<00:03:59.010> mentioned<00:03:59.519> year<00:03:59.640> one<00:03:59.850> which

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:00.090 
and especially mentioned year one which

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:02.420 
and especially mentioned year one which
is<00:04:00.239> seminal<00:04:01.200> and<00:04:01.620> really<00:04:01.860> brought<00:04:02.010> a<00:04:02.040> lot<00:04:02.250> to

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:02.430 
is seminal and really brought a lot to

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:03.780 
our story I think we're all so heavily

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:05.360 
our story I think we're all so heavily
inspired<00:04:03.959> by<00:04:04.260> what<00:04:04.500> was<00:04:04.620> done<00:04:04.799> before<00:04:04.950> in<00:04:05.310> the

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:07.560 
previous two Arkham games and we want to

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:10.400 
previous two Arkham games and we want to
continue<00:04:07.799> that<00:04:08.160> great<00:04:08.519> work<00:04:09.410> specifically

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:10.410 
continue that great work specifically

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:11.720

developed in the Arkham games the theme

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:15.319 
developed in the Arkham games the theme
of<00:04:13.530> law<00:04:13.920> versus<00:04:14.310> justice<00:04:14.730> being<00:04:14.940> a<00:04:15.000> big<00:04:15.150> one
