00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:08.090
 Hello everyone in this video I want 

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:10.070
 show your home maykravt and show 

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:10.610
 The area where I will write tutorial on 

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:12.860
 hightech 

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:14.990
 I will show the complete home improvement 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:16.760
 which took up minimal space at very 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:19.010
 impressive development prospects 

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:21.560
 now you see my home on the server 

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:23.119
 which if I'm not mistaken for almost a year 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:25.640
 yes yes you heard right 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:26.869
 next to this house i recently made 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:29.210
 separate large private where 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:30.829
 actually all and I will not be moved 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:33.320
 delay with the beginning of the reviews immediately 

00:00:30.829 --> 00:00:35.329
 move on to the device at this privat 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:37.910
 his whole life and work is completely 

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:40.670
 support two extreme tights which 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:42.769
 give the output more than two thousand juzat and 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:46.129
 each is a huge amount 

00:00:42.769 --> 00:00:48.050
 electricity generated value 

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:49.940
 This windmill is big enough, but I 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:51.500
 developed the plot of the fact that I have these 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:54.320
 Loops became more than a hundred 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:56.420
 own private cost me dearly 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:58.129
 I had to buy myself the status of a scientist 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:59.780
 to make it so private he 

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:01.129
 automatically done from minimum to 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:03.199
 highest point 

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:05.239
 let's go inside the first house which 

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:07.790
 looks like someone else's low-end dacha 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:10.130
 lodge somewhere in far beyond the city it yes y 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:11.689
 I do not need to store all resources 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:14.450
 ask well what comments you 

00:01:11.689 --> 00:01:17.150
 so many chests if you have me 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:19.880
 controller and a lot of disks at 64 to 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:22.070
 the point is that I like quick access to 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:24.229
 resources especially to those who are very 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:26.479
 often needed mostly this rare very 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:28.270
 necessary crafting resources and just 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:29.920
 tools and devices 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:31.840
 that's actually what I have stored in 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:33.429
 base of them, I basically nothing 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:35.320
 surprising or transcendental 

00:01:33.429 --> 00:01:37.630
 fairly normal diet lover 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:40.869
 Kharkov chest as I have stored 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:42.270
 devices and many others 

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:46.240
 interesting things 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:48.610
 we leave the house and go further by the way on 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:51.069
 the construction of all this stuff is gone completely 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:52.179
 a little time since I have resources 

00:01:51.069 --> 00:01:55.630
 there were so many 

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:58.750
 and this tree is generally my symbol 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:01.060
 town sprout of this bush I got 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:02.770
 I canâ€™t really remember where it came from 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:03.310
 the tree actually looks very 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:06.130
 spectacularly 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:07.119
 as you see I spent the light inside 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:09.610
 the tree itself 

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:11.680
 Well, not only in his wiring for 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:14.890
 the work of these lamps in the whole privat was 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:16.870
 spent about so 700 and if you take in 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:19.299
 accounting my old house is clearly more 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:21.670
 thousand by the way about my old 

00:02:19.299 --> 00:02:24.160
 at home I said the beginning of the video that he 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:26.230
 about a year this is the case is that 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:28.780
 the gaming world where I'm actually shooting now 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:30.910
 on the server the sky is on the others 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:32.400
 words are not updated for search 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:35.489
 resources there is a separate 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:37.110
 blowjob where wipe 1 month we come to 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:39.900
 the next house that i have in the role 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:42.840
 electric power bank stands in it 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:48.470
 Ibiza is one worth 1 billion and 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:51.150
 and 3rd effect of 40 million and each 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:54.030
 I think many of you know what you need 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:56.310
 this drying and and craft is really very 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:58.829
 and very dumb as kraft it 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:00.989
 I need a lot of time already 

00:02:58.829 --> 00:03:03.540
 four such energy keepers and more 

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:06.750
 four I do not see any reason to do so as 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:10.409
 total volume will not be 4 billion already 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:13.290
 units but only one billion so 

00:03:10.409 --> 00:03:14.700
 same as in one go drying but about this and me 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:18.090
 about all the intricacies 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:19.769
 Greg those and I will tell in tutorial this 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:22.049
 already actually the output of electricity 

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:24.480
 myself fireflies I as wiring 

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:26.220
 used diamond wires all over in 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:28.500
 privat u so how do they stand 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:30.150
 voltage up to 8000 and mustache a in 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:32.549
 aggregates 2 wind turbines will give 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:35.670
 voltage across the wire is only 4000 

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:38.129
 it means we still have 4,000 free 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:39.989
 conduction under all houses I did 

00:03:38.129 --> 00:03:42.540
 this kind of tunnel and this tunnel leads 

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:43.990
 home to the controller family where they are stored 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:45.580
 all resources 

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:47.770
 for those who are still familiar with 

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:49.990
 schedule and generally had since we build 

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:52.300
 world atech and i can say that here 

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:54.820
 even cheaper diamond wires since 

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:56.230
 place of diamonds are mainly used 

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:58.570
 only rubies 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:00.520
 this is already juicy industrial bay with 

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:03.250
 multiband handler from greg fashion 

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:04.870
 of those who are interdimensional 

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:06.330
 energy keeper and desu 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:08.310
 also 

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:10.500
 I put modules on many handlers 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:13.350
 accelerator modules to increase reception 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:15.360
 electricity so they work in 

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:17.459
 several times faster than working 

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:20.010
 before the truth costs it all much 

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:21.810
 more expensive in its industrial bay 

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:22.590
 also spent the light like all 

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:24.330
 private 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:27.080
 but in my opinion it looks easy 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:27.080
 beautiful and aesthetic 

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:35.340
 low blow again this interstellar i 

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:37.920
 now in lane call all graphic 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:40.650
 bugs so but if you just watched this 

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:43.440
 film surely remember that when 

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:46.500
 the main character knew the fabric of the universe 

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:48.480
 she looked about the same of course 

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:51.300
 This is most likely a problem with the video card 

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:53.700
 or just problems with java and dayment 

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:55.440
 frame then but actually smoothly 

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:58.110
 crept to the last house which 

00:04:55.440 --> 00:05:00.390
 by the way i really like i would 

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:03.090
 even said that this is home from low budget 

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:05.730
 the best in my house itself 

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:07.470
 all 1 powerful devices from all mods 

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:09.240
 but maybe with the exception of a few 

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:12.210
 which are really just not needed 

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:13.360
 I also upgraded many devices 

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:15.960
 accelerators 

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:17.159
 informants also as multi-block 

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:20.139
 handlers 

00:05:17.159 --> 00:05:22.870
 for example this crusher takes 512 

00:05:20.139 --> 00:05:24.819
 units per tick set in it if 

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:26.560
 not mistaken about ten accelerators 

00:05:24.819 --> 00:05:28.810
 this is a very high speed 

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:30.939
 In principle, this device is all enough 

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:33.669
 spacious and uncomplicated in me 

00:05:30.939 --> 00:05:35.979
 private which has everything you need for 

00:05:33.669 --> 00:05:39.550
 development and subsequent installation of different 

00:05:35.979 --> 00:05:41.590
 factories if you want more tutorial in 

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:44.439
 literally put like the more 

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:46.509
 likes the more chance and in general I will 

00:05:44.439 --> 00:05:48.370
 very pleased with your subscription and immensely 

00:05:46.509 --> 00:05:58.539
 happy if you check out video about 

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:59.800
 gags mycroft nasty there chest 

00:05:58.539 --> 00:06:03.300
 worth 

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:03.300
 look there chests
