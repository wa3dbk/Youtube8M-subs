00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.310 
though I've only had it for a couple
weeks<00:00:41.730> but<00:00:41.969> I<00:00:42.030> absolutely<00:00:42.510> love<00:00:42.930> it

weeks but I absolutely love it
I'm<00:00:44.250> going<00:00:44.550> digital<00:00:45.539> out<00:00:46.050> of<00:00:46.079> the<00:00:46.379> ensemble

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:46.700 
I'm going digital out of the ensemble

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:52.700 
I'm going digital out of the ensemble
into<00:00:48.079> the<00:00:49.079> aid<00:00:49.289> that<00:00:49.940> digital<00:00:50.940> input<00:00:51.449> of<00:00:51.710> the

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
into the aid that digital input of the

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.700 
into the aid that digital input of the
digi<00:00:53.160> O<00:00:53.190> 3<00:00:53.550> which<00:00:53.789> is<00:00:53.820> clocked<00:00:54.390> to<00:00:54.719> the

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.849 
digi O 3 which is clocked to the
ensemble<00:00:56.160> and<00:00:56.899> then<00:00:57.899> we're<00:00:58.079> going<00:00:58.289> into<00:00:58.739> the

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
ensemble and then we're going into the

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:02.930 
ensemble and then we're going into the
platform<00:00:59.129> of<00:00:59.850> Pro<00:01:00.180> Tools<00:01:00.559> which<00:01:01.559> again<00:01:02.489> is<00:01:02.699> my

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
platform of Pro Tools which again is my

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:09.149 
platform of Pro Tools which again is my
platform<00:01:03.629> for<00:01:03.840> recording

00:01:09.149 --> 00:01:09.159 

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:15.920 

so<00:01:09.790> I<00:01:11.310> absolutely<00:01:12.310> loved<00:01:12.850> this<00:01:13.090> mic<00:01:13.360> pre

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:21.420 

reason<00:01:16.930> reason<00:01:17.710> being<00:01:18.009> because<00:01:20.100> it<00:01:21.100> gives

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:21.430 
reason reason being because it gives

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:23.510 
reason reason being because it gives
such<00:01:21.670> a<00:01:21.700> clean<00:01:22.030> vocal<00:01:22.540> as<00:01:22.659> you<00:01:22.840> could<00:01:23.020> see

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
such a clean vocal as you could see

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:28.380 
such a clean vocal as you could see
first<00:01:24.520> thing<00:01:24.729> I'm<00:01:24.880> going<00:01:25.060> to<00:01:25.210> do<00:01:25.570> is<00:01:25.869> I<00:01:27.390> have

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:28.390 
first thing I'm going to do is I have

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:31.200 
first thing I'm going to do is I have
this<00:01:28.960> already<00:01:29.320> preset<00:01:29.619> I<00:01:30.070> spent<00:01:30.610> about<00:01:30.850> five

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:31.210 
this already preset I spent about five

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:33.830 
this already preset I spent about five
minutes<00:01:31.509> ten<00:01:31.930> minutes<00:01:32.110> preset<00:01:32.770> in<00:01:32.890> my<00:01:33.009> vocal

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
minutes ten minutes preset in my vocal

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.980 
minutes ten minutes preset in my vocal
to<00:01:34.840> what<00:01:35.770> I<00:01:35.799> would<00:01:36.220> say<00:01:36.520> I<00:01:36.789> like<00:01:37.119> my<00:01:37.360> vocal<00:01:37.869> to

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:37.990 
to what I would say I like my vocal to

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:40.980 
to what I would say I like my vocal to
sound<00:01:38.259> like<00:01:38.470> if<00:01:38.619> I<00:01:38.740> was<00:01:38.950> talking<00:01:39.360> I'm<00:01:40.360> gonna

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:40.990 
sound like if I was talking I'm gonna

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:43.950 
sound like if I was talking I'm gonna
take<00:01:41.259> out<00:01:41.440> the<00:01:41.470> compressor<00:01:42.159> first<00:01:42.490> and<00:01:42.960> you

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:43.960 
take out the compressor first and you

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:46.260 
take out the compressor first and you
will<00:01:44.110> see<00:01:44.350> how<00:01:45.220> much<00:01:45.369> of<00:01:45.429> a<00:01:45.640> difference<00:01:45.850> the

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:46.270 
will see how much of a difference the

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:52.040 
will see how much of a difference the
compressor<00:01:46.840> in<00:01:47.050> the<00:01:47.530> mic<00:01:47.710> pre<00:01:47.979> actually<00:01:48.850> makes

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:52.050 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:56.790 

so<00:01:53.050> this<00:01:53.830> is<00:01:54.100> the<00:01:54.340> vocal<00:01:54.850> of<00:01:55.149> the<00:01:56.020> compressor

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:56.800 
so this is the vocal of the compressor

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:03.510 
so this is the vocal of the compressor
out<00:01:58.380> or<00:01:59.380> bypassed<00:02:01.409> so<00:02:02.409> as<00:02:02.679> you<00:02:02.860> can<00:02:02.979> see<00:02:03.039> it's<00:02:03.429> a

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:03.520 
out or bypassed so as you can see it's a

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:05.309 
out or bypassed so as you can see it's a
little<00:02:03.640> less<00:02:03.940> controllable<00:02:04.569> if<00:02:04.869> I<00:02:04.990> say

00:02:05.309 --> 00:02:05.319 
little less controllable if I say

00:02:05.319 --> 00:02:07.680 
little less controllable if I say
something<00:02:05.770> a<00:02:05.860> little<00:02:06.130> louder<00:02:06.340> or<00:02:06.670> softer<00:02:06.700> it

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:07.690 
something a little louder or softer it

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:10.979 
something a little louder or softer it
doesn't<00:02:08.229> get<00:02:08.709> tamed<00:02:09.069> down<00:02:09.280> or<00:02:09.789> you<00:02:10.509> know<00:02:10.660> if<00:02:10.869> I

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:10.989 
doesn't get tamed down or you know if I

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:14.100 
doesn't get tamed down or you know if I
go<00:02:11.170> soft<00:02:11.530> if<00:02:12.010> I<00:02:12.100> put<00:02:12.310> it<00:02:12.430> back<00:02:12.549> in<00:02:13.019> you'll<00:02:14.019> see

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.110 
go soft if I put it back in you'll see

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:18.090 
go soft if I put it back in you'll see
when<00:02:15.040> I<00:02:15.070> go<00:02:15.790> loud<00:02:16.090> or<00:02:16.390> soft<00:02:16.660> it's<00:02:17.410> the<00:02:17.769> same

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:18.100 
when I go loud or soft it's the same

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:31.140 
when I go loud or soft it's the same
kind<00:02:18.940> of<00:02:19.230> volume

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:36.880 

if<00:02:32.150> I<00:02:32.360> take<00:02:32.660> out<00:02:32.840> the<00:02:33.050> EQ<00:02:35.770> leaving<00:02:36.770> the

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:36.890 
if I take out the EQ leaving the

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:39.390 
if I take out the EQ leaving the
compressor<00:02:37.430> in<00:02:37.580> you'll<00:02:38.270> hear

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:39.400 
compressor in you'll hear

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:43.380 
compressor in you'll hear
very<00:02:40.400> big<00:02:41.440> difference<00:02:42.440> in<00:02:42.620> quality<00:02:42.890> and

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:43.390 
very big difference in quality and

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:50.170 
very big difference in quality and
overall<00:02:44.920> sonic<00:02:46.120> quality<00:02:48.610> so<00:02:49.610> that's<00:02:49.850> what<00:02:50.060> the

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:50.180 
overall sonic quality so that's what the

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:52.210 
overall sonic quality so that's what the
compressor<00:02:50.780> out<00:02:50.810> I<00:02:51.140> mean<00:02:51.350> the<00:02:51.500> compressor<00:02:52.010> in

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:52.220 
compressor out I mean the compressor in

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:57.010 
compressor out I mean the compressor in
and<00:02:52.580> the<00:02:53.270> EQ<00:02:53.690> out<00:02:54.940> if<00:02:55.940> I<00:02:56.150> take<00:02:56.390> the<00:02:56.510> compressor

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:57.020 
and the EQ out if I take the compressor

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:00.910 
and the EQ out if I take the compressor
and<00:02:57.140> the<00:02:57.230> EQ<00:02:57.950> oh<00:02:58.600> you<00:02:59.600> can<00:02:59.780> only<00:02:59.930> guess<00:03:00.680> what's

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:00.920 
and the EQ oh you can only guess what's

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:02.550 
and the EQ oh you can only guess what's
going<00:03:01.130> to<00:03:01.190> happen

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:02.560 
going to happen

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:06.310 
going to happen
it<00:03:03.560> goes<00:03:03.800> even<00:03:04.130> more<00:03:04.570> uncontrollable<00:03:05.570> and

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:06.320 
it goes even more uncontrollable and

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:10.780 
it goes even more uncontrollable and
low-end<00:03:07.160> muffle<00:03:08.060> and<00:03:09.100> this<00:03:10.100> is<00:03:10.280> a<00:03:10.310> good<00:03:10.550> mic

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:10.790 
low-end muffle and this is a good mic
