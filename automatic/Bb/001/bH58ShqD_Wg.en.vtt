00:00:07.939 --> 00:00:10.459
 how about friends welcome to your future however 

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:13.789
 currently the status of compact pensions 

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:16.919
 also known as crossover the market is being invaded 

00:00:16.919 --> 00:00:18.989
 that's because of its great versatility 

00:00:18.989 --> 00:00:22.250
 On the one hand we can find ourselves driving or we weigh a thousand kilos 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:26.200
 comfortably in the city without suffering substantially for the space 

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:27.919
 that deals with disappoint us 

00:00:27.919 --> 00:00:31.259
 and also having the advantage of being able to overcome the potholes 

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:32.710
 2. 3% 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:34.790
 some of those a common 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:37.790
 and on the other we can find a vehicle 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:39.690
 recreational 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:40.629
 funny 

00:00:40.629 --> 00:00:43.799
 if we can add a weekend, the road came to keep the 

00:00:43.799 --> 00:00:44.760
 beginning 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.690
 in the forest where we are going to demand a bit of theater fair to live with 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:49.340
 nature 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:52.800
 between that market is more than 15 models that are competing to be the best 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:57.770
 one of them we can say that it highlights possibility because of the great balance in its 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:58.820
 written 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:00.590
 think about the tally and talking 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:03.590
 come with me find out 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:05.910
 because this step imagined 

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:09.700
 we are talking about the 2010 crc board 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:10.950
 Who 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.830
 for this year good apart that is the third generation of this for the other 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:18.439
 he suffered his first update that is composed 

00:01:18.439 --> 00:01:19.689
 on the outside 

00:01:19.689 --> 00:01:22.070
 by four basis points 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:24.370
 we have a grill 

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:27.820
 more stylized with the jontahan motto in the center 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:30.050
 if the share is very similar to the b 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:32.430
 other models of the 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.200
 the part of the fascia we have a redesign of france now the headlights of 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.789
 fog 

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:39.610
 are included in the entry part of the 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:40.850
 Of the same 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:43.380
 in the photo of the hostages we have a 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.479
 the change of the sector and burning and some 17-inch wheels now dt 

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:48.450
 and in arms 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.310
 and the last change that was made in the back is a redesign of the 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:55.990
 defense don beto rear reflectors now part of the area 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:58.240
 delare painted 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:59.429
 in the end 

00:01:59.429 --> 00:02:01.290
 these are just aesthetic changes 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:05.960
 let's see what happens with your feet inside and especially that you modify it 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:09.319
 They got on the engine that make this CRB 2010 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:13.140
 a true champion in the field velasteguÃ­ vi compact 

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:18.170
 this year in the interior we have few changes also percent the ignition 

00:02:18.169 --> 00:02:19.529
 automatic lights 

00:02:19.529 --> 00:02:22.559
 is that the truth is appreciated because having a board permanently 

00:02:22.559 --> 00:02:23.519
 illuminated 

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:25.249
 we can reach 

00:02:25.249 --> 00:02:28.169
 sometimes to forget the hiker 

00:02:28.169 --> 00:02:30.149
 circular at night in the city 

00:02:30.149 --> 00:02:33.029
 where quite the scam funds 

00:02:33.029 --> 00:02:37.299
 in this version he also came out tapping the doors after grabbing until now they are 

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:39.839
 of a plastic or very soft very 

00:02:39.839 --> 00:02:41.010
 according to experts 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:45.150
 and immigrants also grew up or eye diseases hugs 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:48.249
 we simply have in the spaces 

00:02:48.249 --> 00:02:50.019
 percent the level this year 

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:51.859
 general we can say that 

00:02:51.859 --> 00:02:55.659
 efe one of the attributes that really makes you get away from goal 

00:02:55.659 --> 00:02:56.600
 outstanding 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:59.919
 is the sense of space that we have inside them 

00:02:59.919 --> 00:03:02.469
 of it came 1 90 

00:03:02.469 --> 00:03:06.760
 of stature all came who the leading front well-known comfortably and 

00:03:06.759 --> 00:03:09.689
 without moving my seat I can move to the back 

00:03:09.689 --> 00:03:13.400
 literally distance that there is between laughter with it was presented in front 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:17.059
 bodies of a few centimeters that is greatly appreciated when making 

00:03:17.059 --> 00:03:18.069
 lessons 

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:22.409
 the prolonged also something that the standout are all the festive 

00:03:22.409 --> 00:03:24.069
 spaces that we have in this 

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:26.670
 this truck next to the doors of the state model 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:31.269
 placed his obligations inside homes for this month's bouts 

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:35.009
 but for cigars some shows to be placed 

00:03:35.009 --> 00:03:35.949
 objects 

00:03:35.949 --> 00:03:38.949
 in front of the other because we also have two 

00:03:39.979 --> 00:03:44.219
 two drawers where we can place the objects that this is that we want in the 

00:03:44.219 --> 00:03:47.339
 part of the audio we have a stereo the 

00:03:47.339 --> 00:03:49.399
 with six compact discs 

00:03:49.399 --> 00:03:53.219
 which as good as modification also seems years that I got to 

00:03:53.219 --> 00:03:54.259
 the 

00:03:54.259 --> 00:03:57.539
 entrance of you so that we 

00:03:57.539 --> 00:03:59.269
 we can 

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:03.090
 10 access to those we can mention in the offices that we have in the trunk 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:06.670
 maybe it looks a bit limited by the same shape of the truck 

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:10.120
 but when they are above 500 liters of narcotic schools 

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:13.949
 he gives us the opportunity to load many things for this year 

00:04:13.949 --> 00:04:15.000
 they went up the 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
 the horsepower of engines and other technical adjustments 

00:04:18.819 --> 00:04:22.209
 after having a 163 horsepower engine last year 

00:04:22.719 --> 00:04:24.370
 currently percent 

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:27.400
 Tokyo 9 horses 175 horsepower 

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:31.170
 cheppi the relationship that exists with the automatic gearbox that 

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:35.449
 five speeds with a system that the project that makes the changes be 

00:04:35.449 --> 00:04:39.920
 three times in an intelligent way makes in this engine power delivery 

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:42.460
 60 in a way 

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:45.409
 very smooth this powertrain has a 

00:04:45.409 --> 00:04:49.849
 a very adequate performance the acceleration from 0 to 100 the kpc of 

00:04:49.849 --> 00:04:55.689
 do it in 15 seconds the braking from 100 to 0 of 42 by 100 meters and especially in 

00:04:55.689 --> 00:05:01.479
 the recovery doing 80 to 120 in about seven seconds 

00:05:01.479 --> 00:05:04.839
 coupled by insisting on the driving force of the relationship 

00:05:04.839 --> 00:05:08.719
 motor case, in this case, in the presence of emotion and on four wheels 

00:05:08.719 --> 00:05:10.340
 that are activated in real time 

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:11.779
 What does this mean? 

00:05:11.779 --> 00:05:15.959
 that will help us henning situations where will act in our country we have 

00:05:15.959 --> 00:05:17.120
 this rain 

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:20.770
 i the vehicle was attracted there is a control system that automatically 

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:22.199
 will perceive 

00:05:22.199 --> 00:05:25.930
 the order of three in the front products of automatic month of low 

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:28.870
 aa l transmit the power to the rear wheels 

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:30.550
 this truck also highlights 

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:32.020
 in questions well 

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:33.419
 of security 

00:05:33.419 --> 00:05:35.889
 by the way that we have mentioned to highlight 

00:05:35.889 --> 00:05:37.120
 for one hundrerd 

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:41.850
 the braking system sometimes the braking stress auxiliary system we have 

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:46.000
 six airbags two frontal two lateral and two of type or with their 

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:46.669
 curtains 

00:05:46.669 --> 00:05:48.879
 but definitely one of the technicians 

00:05:48.879 --> 00:05:52.929
 but above all, since we have expectations that at the time of 

00:05:52.929 --> 00:05:54.389
 choose an impact 

00:05:54.389 --> 00:05:57.610
 are traversed forward to prevent our project head towards 

00:05:57.610 --> 00:05:58.439
 behind 

00:05:58.439 --> 00:06:00.240
 something that we can live 

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:03.849
 thinking about improving this truck would be 

00:06:03.849 --> 00:06:07.760
 the type of slow courts that we have in this version of tevenet in the trunk 

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:11.430
 since the alleged somewhat complicated in giving those who are responding when 

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:12.800
 we require 

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:15.879
 ntr introduce large volumes 

00:06:15.879 --> 00:06:17.900
 in conclusion this truck 

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:20.719
 it is so successful according to our appreciation 

00:06:20.719 --> 00:06:22.800
 over the safety equipment 

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:26.780
 its excellent dynamic behavior by the current the feeling of space 

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:29.439
 inside we have when driving 

00:06:29.439 --> 00:06:33.009
 that's why we can say that this girl is the best in the class because in all her 

00:06:33.009 --> 00:06:33.710
 batteries 

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:36.920
 stands out between 8 5 and 6 months but is constant 

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:41.060
 this is consultants promoters offers revealed that he 

00:06:42.349 --> 00:06:46.999
 and we wait for your comments below the page by 10 am to contact them by 

00:06:46.999 --> 00:06:49.809
 twitter the auto office 

00:06:49.809 --> 00:06:51.979
 and look what they are 

00:06:51.979 --> 00:06:52.629
 until next time
