00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:38.170 
coconut oil and your shredded soap and
then<00:01:32.460> just<00:01:32.640> start<00:01:32.850> mixing<00:01:33.030> that<00:01:33.270> together

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:38.180 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:41.540 

and<00:01:39.180> then<00:01:39.930> just<00:01:40.440> go<00:01:40.590> to<00:01:40.650> your<00:01:40.830> microwave<00:01:41.160> and

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:41.550 
and then just go to your microwave and

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:44.540 
and then just go to your microwave and
then<00:01:41.760> put<00:01:42.420> that<00:01:42.630> in<00:01:42.900> and<00:01:43.260> then<00:01:43.560> set<00:01:43.980> the<00:01:44.250> timer

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:44.550 
then put that in and then set the timer

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:46.850 
then put that in and then set the timer
to<00:01:44.730> 10<00:01:45.270> seconds<00:01:45.930> and<00:01:46.110> you<00:01:46.500> want<00:01:46.650> to<00:01:46.710> make<00:01:46.830> sure

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
to 10 seconds and you want to make sure

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.800 
to 10 seconds and you want to make sure
it's<00:01:47.160> 10<00:01:47.400> seconds<00:01:47.820> so<00:01:48.000> that<00:01:48.180> it<00:01:48.330> doesn't

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
it's 10 seconds so that it doesn't

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.450 
it's 10 seconds so that it doesn't
overheat<00:01:48.950> or<00:01:50.210> explode<00:01:51.710> so<00:01:52.710> once<00:01:53.010> that's<00:01:53.160> done

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
overheat or explode so once that's done

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.670 
overheat or explode so once that's done
just<00:01:53.520> take<00:01:53.910> it<00:01:54.030> out<00:01:54.150> and<00:01:54.180> start<00:01:54.810> mixing<00:01:55.080> it

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
just take it out and start mixing it

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.380 
just take it out and start mixing it
together<00:01:55.860> and<00:01:56.250> then<00:01:56.430> you're<00:01:56.820> gonna<00:01:56.970> repeat

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
together and then you're gonna repeat

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.570 
together and then you're gonna repeat
this<00:01:57.570> process<00:01:57.810> until<00:01:58.200> all<00:01:58.650> of<00:01:58.710> the<00:01:59.250> shredded

00:01:59.570 --> 00:01:59.580 
this process until all of the shredded

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:09.749 
this process until all of the shredded
soap<00:01:59.970> bits<00:02:00.240> are<00:02:00.450> melted<00:02:01.020> into<00:02:01.260> the<00:02:01.830> oil

00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:09.759 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:13.660 

so<00:02:10.759> I<00:02:10.789> actually<00:02:11.150> ended<00:02:11.360> up<00:02:11.870> having<00:02:12.430> some<00:02:13.430> bits

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:13.670 
so I actually ended up having some bits

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:16.990 
so I actually ended up having some bits
of<00:02:14.170> unmelted<00:02:15.170> soap<00:02:15.709> in<00:02:15.890> there<00:02:16.040> but<00:02:16.370> it<00:02:16.640> turned

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000 
of unmelted soap in there but it turned

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.910 
of unmelted soap in there but it turned
out<00:02:17.090> fine<00:02:17.329> in<00:02:17.510> the<00:02:17.569> end<00:02:17.629> so<00:02:17.930> that's<00:02:18.079> okay<00:02:18.409> but

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:18.920 
out fine in the end so that's okay but

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:20.500 
out fine in the end so that's okay but
now<00:02:19.069> I'm<00:02:19.220> just<00:02:19.400> adding<00:02:19.610> in<00:02:19.879> my<00:02:20.090> vanilla

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510 
now I'm just adding in my vanilla

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:24.100 
now I'm just adding in my vanilla
extract<00:02:21.640> so<00:02:22.640> I'm<00:02:22.939> just<00:02:23.269> mixing<00:02:23.689> it<00:02:23.959> all

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:24.110 
extract so I'm just mixing it all

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:30.509 
extract so I'm just mixing it all
together<00:02:24.290> and<00:02:24.650> this<00:02:24.890> gives<00:02:25.159> an<00:02:25.400> amazing<00:02:26.120> scent

00:02:30.509 --> 00:02:30.519 

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:33.009 

so<00:02:31.519> at<00:02:31.760> this<00:02:31.940> point<00:02:32.120> you<00:02:32.329> want<00:02:32.420> to<00:02:32.540> work<00:02:32.690> pretty

00:02:33.009 --> 00:02:33.019 
so at this point you want to work pretty

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:35.170 
so at this point you want to work pretty
fast<00:02:33.140> and<00:02:33.620> just<00:02:33.860> add<00:02:34.010> in<00:02:34.459> all<00:02:34.730> of<00:02:34.760> your<00:02:35.000> sugar

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.180 
fast and just add in all of your sugar

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:37.839 
fast and just add in all of your sugar
and<00:02:35.480> just<00:02:35.720> start<00:02:35.930> mixing<00:02:36.170> because<00:02:36.859> the<00:02:37.489> soap

00:02:37.839 --> 00:02:37.849 
and just start mixing because the soap

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:41.140 
and just start mixing because the soap
does<00:02:38.349> set<00:02:39.349> pretty<00:02:39.680> quickly<00:02:39.980> so<00:02:40.489> you<00:02:40.790> want<00:02:40.970> to

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:41.150 
does set pretty quickly so you want to

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:43.270 
does set pretty quickly so you want to
work<00:02:41.269> fast<00:02:41.599> or<00:02:41.840> else<00:02:41.989> you<00:02:42.500> won't<00:02:42.620> be<00:02:42.769> able<00:02:42.980> to

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280 
work fast or else you won't be able to

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:53.649 
work fast or else you won't be able to
put<00:02:43.609> it<00:02:43.700> into<00:02:43.879> your<00:02:44.150> mold<00:02:51.790> so<00:02:52.790> this<00:02:53.299> is<00:02:53.450> what

00:02:53.649 --> 00:02:53.659 
put it into your mold so this is what

00:02:53.659 --> 00:02:55.869 
put it into your mold so this is what
mine<00:02:53.900> looked<00:02:54.290> like<00:02:54.379> and<00:02:54.769> then<00:02:54.859> I<00:02:55.069> just<00:02:55.280> put

00:02:55.869 --> 00:02:55.879 
mine looked like and then I just put

00:02:55.879 --> 00:02:59.530 
mine looked like and then I just put
them<00:02:56.389> into<00:02:56.780> my<00:02:57.560> cupcake<00:02:58.069> liners<00:02:58.519> and<00:02:58.760> you<00:02:59.359> have

00:02:59.530 --> 00:02:59.540 
them into my cupcake liners and you have

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:01.569 
them into my cupcake liners and you have
to<00:02:59.659> make<00:02:59.870> sure<00:02:59.900> that<00:03:00.349> you<00:03:00.739> press<00:03:01.280> them<00:03:01.549> down

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:01.579 
to make sure that you press them down

00:03:01.579 --> 00:03:04.300 
to make sure that you press them down
really<00:03:02.299> nicely<00:03:02.540> and<00:03:02.930> pack<00:03:03.440> them<00:03:03.680> down<00:03:03.859> or<00:03:04.099> else

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:04.310 
really nicely and pack them down or else

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:07.059 
really nicely and pack them down or else
they<00:03:04.609> won't<00:03:04.879> turn<00:03:05.180> out<00:03:05.329> solid<00:03:05.840> and<00:03:06.019> they'll<00:03:06.889> be

00:03:07.059 --> 00:03:07.069 
they won't turn out solid and they'll be

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:10.569 
they won't turn out solid and they'll be
all<00:03:07.280> loose<00:03:07.609> and<00:03:07.970> crumbly<00:03:08.480> and<00:03:09.159> another<00:03:10.159> reason

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:10.579 
all loose and crumbly and another reason

00:03:10.579 --> 00:03:12.729 
all loose and crumbly and another reason
why<00:03:10.700> they<00:03:10.970> might<00:03:11.150> be<00:03:11.389> kind<00:03:12.109> of<00:03:12.230> crumbly<00:03:12.680> is

00:03:12.729 --> 00:03:12.739 
why they might be kind of crumbly is

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:15.610 
why they might be kind of crumbly is
because<00:03:13.159> you<00:03:13.879> didn't<00:03:14.419> melt<00:03:14.750> the<00:03:15.079> soap<00:03:15.349> down

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:15.620 
because you didn't melt the soap down

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:19.270 
because you didn't melt the soap down
properly<00:03:16.220> like<00:03:16.730> mine<00:03:17.000> but<00:03:17.530> in<00:03:18.530> the<00:03:18.709> end<00:03:18.889> it

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:19.280 
properly like mine but in the end it

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:21.430 
properly like mine but in the end it
works<00:03:19.579> out<00:03:19.760> fine<00:03:20.060> so<00:03:20.120> if<00:03:20.599> you<00:03:20.720> have<00:03:20.900> a<00:03:20.930> bit<00:03:21.290> of

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:21.440 
works out fine so if you have a bit of

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:23.710 
works out fine so if you have a bit of
crumble<00:03:22.010> enos<00:03:22.310> it's<00:03:22.519> fine<00:03:22.730> and<00:03:23.000> so<00:03:23.569> you're

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:23.720 
crumble enos it's fine and so you're

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:25.390 
crumble enos it's fine and so you're
gonna<00:03:23.810> let<00:03:24.139> that<00:03:24.169> set<00:03:24.620> for<00:03:24.650> one<00:03:25.099> to<00:03:25.220> two<00:03:25.370> hours

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:25.400 
gonna let that set for one to two hours

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:28.539 
gonna let that set for one to two hours
outside<00:03:25.970> or<00:03:26.540> in<00:03:27.169> the<00:03:27.290> freezer<00:03:27.530> for<00:03:27.889> 10<00:03:28.160> to<00:03:28.340> 20

00:03:28.539 --> 00:03:28.549 
outside or in the freezer for 10 to 20

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:33.460 
outside or in the freezer for 10 to 20
minutes<00:03:28.669> and<00:03:30.220> after<00:03:31.220> I<00:03:31.250> waited<00:03:31.879> that<00:03:32.120> I<00:03:32.569> took

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:33.470 
minutes and after I waited that I took

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:35.349 
minutes and after I waited that I took
it<00:03:33.620> out<00:03:33.739> or<00:03:34.099> not<00:03:34.340> took<00:03:34.489> it<00:03:34.609> out<00:03:34.730> I<00:03:34.760> left<00:03:35.180> it

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:35.359 
it out or not took it out I left it

00:03:35.359 --> 00:03:39.000 
it out or not took it out I left it
there<00:03:35.389> and<00:03:35.720> I'm<00:03:36.139> just<00:03:36.410> taking<00:03:36.709> out<00:03:36.829> the<00:03:37.220> little

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:39.010 
there and I'm just taking out the little

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:42.640 
there and I'm just taking out the little
scrubs<00:03:40.010> and<00:03:40.459> I<00:03:41.329> actually<00:03:41.720> didn't<00:03:42.260> wait<00:03:42.470> the

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:42.650 
scrubs and I actually didn't wait the

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:44.860 
scrubs and I actually didn't wait the
full<00:03:42.889> hour<00:03:43.190> to<00:03:43.730> two<00:03:43.910> hours<00:03:43.940> I<00:03:44.299> actually<00:03:44.510> only

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:44.870 
full hour to two hours I actually only

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:46.900 
full hour to two hours I actually only
waited<00:03:45.319> half<00:03:45.709> an<00:03:45.919> hour<00:03:46.040> so<00:03:46.280> that's<00:03:46.430> why<00:03:46.669> it's

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:46.910 
waited half an hour so that's why it's

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:49.949 
waited half an hour so that's why it's
being<00:03:47.239> crumbly<00:03:47.959> right<00:03:48.260> now<00:03:48.440> but<00:03:48.799> if<00:03:49.069> you<00:03:49.459> do

00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:49.959 
being crumbly right now but if you do

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:52.149 
being crumbly right now but if you do
wait<00:03:50.959> that<00:03:51.169> long<00:03:51.319> then<00:03:51.590> it<00:03:51.620> will<00:03:51.980> be<00:03:52.129> a

00:03:52.149 --> 00:03:52.159 
wait that long then it will be a

00:03:52.159 --> 00:03:55.839 
wait that long then it will be a
rock-hard<00:03:54.069> this<00:03:55.069> is<00:03:55.250> what<00:03:55.459> they<00:03:55.609> look<00:03:55.819> like

00:03:55.839 --> 00:03:55.849 
rock-hard this is what they look like

00:03:55.849 --> 00:03:58.000 
rock-hard this is what they look like
after<00:03:56.269> and<00:03:56.629> I<00:03:56.690> think<00:03:56.959> these<00:03:57.079> are<00:03:57.290> really<00:03:57.709> cute

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:58.010 
after and I think these are really cute

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:02.470 
after and I think these are really cute
and<00:03:58.340> it's<00:03:59.290> really<00:04:00.290> awesome<00:04:00.919> because<00:04:01.480> they're

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:02.480 
and it's really awesome because they're

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:06.399 
and it's really awesome because they're
like<00:04:02.720> a<00:04:02.750> three<00:04:03.109> and<00:04:03.260> one<00:04:03.319> a<00:04:03.739> scrub<00:04:05.409> cleansing

00:04:06.399 --> 00:04:06.409 
like a three and one a scrub cleansing

00:04:06.409 --> 00:04:09.520 
like a three and one a scrub cleansing
thing<00:04:06.709> and<00:04:07.129> also<00:04:07.819> a<00:04:08.000> moisturizer<00:04:08.659> so<00:04:09.409> if

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:09.530 
thing and also a moisturizer so if

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:11.589 
thing and also a moisturizer so if
you're<00:04:09.650> gonna<00:04:09.739> use<00:04:10.040> this<00:04:10.400> just<00:04:10.849> wet<00:04:11.090> the<00:04:11.120> area

00:04:11.589 --> 00:04:11.599 
you're gonna use this just wet the area

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:15.219 
you're gonna use this just wet the area
and<00:04:11.870> then<00:04:12.049> scrub<00:04:13.010> it<00:04:13.129> on<00:04:13.280> and<00:04:13.639> then<00:04:13.790> just<00:04:14.229> keep

00:04:15.219 --> 00:04:15.229 
and then scrub it on and then just keep

00:04:15.229 --> 00:04:17.289 
and then scrub it on and then just keep
scrubbing<00:04:15.560> and<00:04:16.039> it<00:04:16.430> actually<00:04:16.729> turns<00:04:16.970> into<00:04:17.120> a

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:17.299 
scrubbing and it actually turns into a

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:19.029 
scrubbing and it actually turns into a
lather<00:04:17.570> because<00:04:17.989> of<00:04:18.109> the<00:04:18.229> soap<00:04:18.500> in<00:04:18.680> it<00:04:18.769> so<00:04:19.010> I

00:04:19.029 --> 00:04:19.039 
lather because of the soap in it so I

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:21.289 
lather because of the soap in it so I
think<00:04:19.400> that's<00:04:19.579> really<00:04:19.969> cool

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:21.299 
think that's really cool

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:23.689 
think that's really cool
and<00:04:21.389> then<00:04:21.989> just<00:04:22.379> rinse<00:04:22.770> that<00:04:23.099> off<00:04:23.310> and<00:04:23.550> then

00:04:23.689 --> 00:04:23.699 
and then just rinse that off and then

00:04:23.699 --> 00:04:30.879 
and then just rinse that off and then
your<00:04:23.849> skin<00:04:24.090> should<00:04:24.300> be<00:04:24.479> so<00:04:24.900> so<00:04:25.620> smooth
