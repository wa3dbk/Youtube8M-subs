put<00:00:37.380> this<00:00:37.559> particular<00:00:37.920> card<00:00:38.550> in<00:00:38.760> is<00:00:38.969> that<00:00:39.809> this

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
put this particular card in is that this

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:45.200 
put this particular card in is that this
computer<00:00:41.180> comes<00:00:42.180> with<00:00:43.399> hard<00:00:44.399> drive<00:00:44.670> caddies

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
computer comes with hard drive caddies

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.639 
computer comes with hard drive caddies
that<00:00:45.690> mount<00:00:46.020> into<00:00:46.950> the<00:00:47.360> frame<00:00:48.360> here<00:00:48.870> so<00:00:49.140> you

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
that mount into the frame here so you

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.689 
that mount into the frame here so you
have<00:00:49.710> to<00:00:49.829> actually<00:00:50.160> modify<00:00:50.550> the<00:00:50.700> chassis<00:00:51.539> to

00:00:52.689 --> 00:00:52.699 
have to actually modify the chassis to

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:56.720 
have to actually modify the chassis to
make<00:00:53.699> this<00:00:53.969> graphics<00:00:54.449> card<00:00:54.510> fit<00:00:55.370> so<00:00:56.370> all<00:00:56.579> you

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
make this graphics card fit so all you

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.869 
make this graphics card fit so all you
have<00:00:56.910> to<00:00:57.059> do<00:00:57.829> so<00:00:58.829> if<00:00:58.890> you<00:00:58.980> take<00:00:59.160> the<00:00:59.280> faceplate

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
have to do so if you take the faceplate

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:08.300 
have to do so if you take the faceplate
off<00:01:03.920> there<00:01:04.920> are<00:01:05.960> two<00:01:06.960> rivets<00:01:07.290> here<00:01:07.860> that<00:01:08.189> can

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
off there are two rivets here that can

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:16.010 
off there are two rivets here that can
be<00:01:08.430> drilled<00:01:08.760> out<00:01:09.320> okay<00:01:10.320> those<00:01:10.770> are<00:01:14.600> what<00:01:15.600> holds

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
be drilled out okay those are what holds

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.730 
be drilled out okay those are what holds
this<00:01:16.650> in<00:01:16.710> at<00:01:17.070> this<00:01:17.220> point<00:01:17.490> on<00:01:17.820> the<00:01:18.270> inside<00:01:18.780> okay

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
this in at this point on the inside okay

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.240 
this in at this point on the inside okay
then<00:01:20.400> there's<00:01:20.610> three<00:01:21.000> rivets<00:01:21.950> here<00:01:22.950> at<00:01:23.130> the

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
then there's three rivets here at the

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.460 
then there's three rivets here at the
bottom<00:01:23.640> these<00:01:23.939> three<00:01:24.299> holes<00:01:24.479> let's<00:01:25.229> line<00:01:25.439> up

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
bottom these three holes let's line up

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:26.899 
bottom these three holes let's line up
with<00:01:25.740> these<00:01:25.860> three<00:01:26.100> holes<00:01:26.369> on<00:01:26.640> the<00:01:26.759> inside

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
with these three holes on the inside

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:28.960 
with these three holes on the inside
again<00:01:27.420> those<00:01:27.780> need<00:01:27.960> to<00:01:27.990> be<00:01:28.200> drilled<00:01:28.439> out<00:01:28.619> and

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:28.970 
again those need to be drilled out and

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:31.580 
again those need to be drilled out and
then<00:01:29.970> on<00:01:30.090> the<00:01:30.180> bottom<00:01:30.360> there's<00:01:31.049> three<00:01:31.350> more

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
then on the bottom there's three more

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.749 
then on the bottom there's three more
holes<00:01:31.860> three<00:01:32.430> more<00:01:32.610> rivets<00:01:33.030> and<00:01:34.460> those<00:01:35.460> line

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
holes three more rivets and those line

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:42.260 
holes three more rivets and those line
up<00:01:36.020> with<00:01:38.869> this<00:01:39.869> part<00:01:40.229> of<00:01:40.439> the<00:01:41.070> hard<00:01:42.030> drive

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
up with this part of the hard drive

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:43.819 
up with this part of the hard drive
caddy<00:01:42.450> so<00:01:42.659> again<00:01:42.840> this<00:01:43.020> is<00:01:43.200> in<00:01:43.350> here<00:01:43.560> this<00:01:43.680> is

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
caddy so again this is in here this is

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:45.770 
caddy so again this is in here this is
keeping<00:01:44.100> you<00:01:44.220> from<00:01:44.250> putting<00:01:44.579> in<00:01:44.880> the<00:01:45.390> graphics

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
keeping you from putting in the graphics

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.090 
keeping you from putting in the graphics
card<00:01:46.020> that<00:01:46.200> you<00:01:46.290> want<00:01:47.119> so<00:01:48.119> you<00:01:48.180> drill<00:01:48.630> one<00:01:49.530> two

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
card that you want so you drill one two

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:55.760 
card that you want so you drill one two
three<00:01:50.909> rivets<00:01:52.189> one<00:01:53.360> two<00:01:54.360> three<00:01:55.170> rivets<00:01:55.439> on<00:01:55.740> the

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
three rivets one two three rivets on the

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.609 
three rivets one two three rivets on the
front<00:01:56.159> and<00:01:56.399> one<00:01:57.060> two<00:01:57.540> more<00:01:58.049> rivets<00:01:58.380> on<00:01:58.500> the

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
front and one two more rivets on the

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:01.969 
front and one two more rivets on the
front<00:01:58.920> and<00:01:59.100> then<00:01:59.719> this<00:02:00.719> will<00:02:00.990> slide<00:02:01.380> out<00:02:01.619> this

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
front and then this will slide out this

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:03.440 
front and then this will slide out this
way<00:02:02.159> you<00:02:02.250> might<00:02:02.430> need<00:02:02.549> to<00:02:02.670> use<00:02:02.700> a<00:02:02.790> pry<00:02:03.149> bar

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
way you might need to use a pry bar

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.550 
way you might need to use a pry bar
but<00:02:03.899> these<00:02:03.990> latch<00:02:04.320> into<00:02:04.649> the<00:02:04.860> bottom<00:02:05.390> of<00:02:06.560> the

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
but these latch into the bottom of the

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.100 
but these latch into the bottom of the
tower<00:02:07.770> itself<00:02:08.369> so<00:02:08.610> but<00:02:08.789> once<00:02:08.970> those<00:02:09.209> rivets

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
tower itself so but once those rivets

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.410 
tower itself so but once those rivets
are<00:02:10.379> drilled<00:02:10.619> out<00:02:10.770> you<00:02:10.950> can<00:02:11.129> slide<00:02:11.370> this<00:02:11.730> out

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
are drilled out you can slide this out

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:14.030 
are drilled out you can slide this out
and<00:02:12.510> it'll<00:02:12.720> come<00:02:12.900> right<00:02:13.140> out<00:02:13.170> so<00:02:13.800> then<00:02:13.920> your

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
and it'll come right out so then your

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.309 
and it'll come right out so then your
problem<00:02:14.520> is<00:02:14.730> where<00:02:15.360> do<00:02:15.450> I<00:02:15.510> put<00:02:15.690> my<00:02:15.720> hard<00:02:16.050> drive

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:16.319 
problem is where do I put my hard drive

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:18.020 
problem is where do I put my hard drive
in<00:02:16.560> most<00:02:17.010> cases<00:02:17.310> you're<00:02:17.580> only<00:02:17.670> going<00:02:17.819> to<00:02:17.880> have

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
in most cases you're only going to have

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.990 
in most cases you're only going to have
one<00:02:18.060> hard<00:02:18.480> drive<00:02:18.860> there<00:02:19.860> is<00:02:20.250> a<00:02:20.280> three<00:02:20.850> and<00:02:20.970> a

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
one hard drive there is a three and a

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.420 
one hard drive there is a three and a
half<00:02:21.180> inch<00:02:21.390> slot<00:02:21.690> here<00:02:22.050> you<00:02:22.770> can<00:02:22.920> mount<00:02:23.130> it

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
half inch slot here you can mount it

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:26.240 
half inch slot here you can mount it
right<00:02:23.670> in<00:02:24.300> here<00:02:24.569> and<00:02:25.140> it'll<00:02:25.290> work<00:02:25.410> just<00:02:25.590> fine<00:02:25.860> I

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
right in here and it'll work just fine I

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.820 
right in here and it'll work just fine I
put<00:02:26.670> a<00:02:26.700> little<00:02:26.880> foam<00:02:27.180> in<00:02:27.540> between<00:02:27.600> there<00:02:28.200> just

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
put a little foam in between there just

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:35.090 
put a little foam in between there just
as<00:02:29.040> a<00:02:29.070> shock<00:02:29.400> absorber<00:02:31.250> hard<00:02:32.250> drives<00:02:32.550> are<00:02:34.100> you

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:35.100 
as a shock absorber hard drives are you

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:37.220 
as a shock absorber hard drives are you
know<00:02:35.190> vibrate<00:02:35.910> and<00:02:36.180> tend<00:02:36.510> to<00:02:36.570> tend<00:02:36.810> to<00:02:36.870> vibrate

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
know vibrate and tend to tend to vibrate

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:38.300 
know vibrate and tend to tend to vibrate
and<00:02:37.350> that<00:02:37.440> could<00:02:37.590> cause<00:02:37.740> problems<00:02:37.770> with<00:02:38.250> the

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
and that could cause problems with the

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:39.590 
and that could cause problems with the
hard<00:02:38.459> drive<00:02:38.640> so<00:02:38.790> I<00:02:38.820> put<00:02:38.970> some<00:02:39.120> foam<00:02:39.330> in<00:02:39.480> there

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:39.600 
hard drive so I put some foam in there

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:41.390 
hard drive so I put some foam in there
just<00:02:39.750> to<00:02:39.870> keep<00:02:39.959> it<00:02:40.110> nice<00:02:40.260> and<00:02:40.290> steady<00:02:41.160> and

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
just to keep it nice and steady and

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.190 
just to keep it nice and steady and
absorb<00:02:41.700> the<00:02:41.819> shock<00:02:42.090> so<00:02:42.600> nothing's<00:02:42.930> gonna<00:02:43.050> go

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
absorb the shock so nothing's gonna go

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:44.420 
absorb the shock so nothing's gonna go
wrong<00:02:43.230> with<00:02:43.470> the<00:02:43.530> hard<00:02:43.709> drive<00:02:43.860> in<00:02:44.069> this

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
wrong with the hard drive in this

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:45.800 
wrong with the hard drive in this
particular<00:02:44.760> model<00:02:45.300> we<00:02:45.390> also<00:02:45.480> put<00:02:45.780> a

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
particular model we also put a

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:48.380 
particular model we also put a
solid-state<00:02:46.380> drive<00:02:46.739> so<00:02:47.580> I<00:02:47.640> mounted<00:02:48.060> that<00:02:48.150> here

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
solid-state drive so I mounted that here

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:51.410 
solid-state drive so I mounted that here
to<00:02:48.510> the<00:02:48.630> front<00:02:49.220> but<00:02:50.220> in<00:02:50.489> most<00:02:50.910> cases<00:02:51.030> you're

out<00:03:53.510> the<00:03:54.510> rivets<00:03:55.440> in<00:03:55.680> the<00:03:55.799> beginning<00:03:56.220> you<00:03:57.090> want

00:03:57.259 --> 00:03:57.269 
out the rivets in the beginning you want

00:03:57.269 --> 00:03:58.759 
out the rivets in the beginning you want
to<00:03:57.360> uninstall<00:03:57.480> your<00:03:57.840> motherboard<00:03:58.380> you<00:03:58.650> don't

00:03:58.759 --> 00:03:58.769 
to uninstall your motherboard you don't

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:01.850 
to uninstall your motherboard you don't
want<00:03:58.890> to<00:03:58.950> get<00:03:59.040> any<00:03:59.220> metal<00:03:59.489> filings<00:04:00.000> or<00:04:00.860> bumping

around<00:04:01.950> on<00:04:02.250> your<00:04:02.370> motherboard<00:04:02.640> so<00:04:03.360> that's

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:03.480 
around on your motherboard so that's

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:04.940 
around on your motherboard so that's
really<00:04:03.690> important<00:04:04.230> I<00:04:04.290> shouldn't<00:04:04.860> mention

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:04.950 
really important I shouldn't mention

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:09.289 
really important I shouldn't mention
that<00:04:05.190> first<00:04:06.260> so<00:04:07.820> because<00:04:08.820> those<00:04:08.970> metal

00:04:09.289 --> 00:04:09.299 
that first so because those metal

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:15.229 
that first so because those metal
shavings<00:04:09.510> could<00:04:09.900> sort<00:04:10.739> out<00:04:10.920> some<00:04:10.950> contacts<00:04:14.239> so

00:04:15.229 --> 00:04:15.239 
shavings could sort out some contacts so

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:17.630 
shavings could sort out some contacts so
then<00:04:15.630> once<00:04:16.500> you're<00:04:16.650> done<00:04:16.799> put<00:04:17.130> your<00:04:17.340> face
