00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560 
just yeah fell apart that I will

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:25.890

recommend<00:02:23.920> buying<00:02:24.640> some<00:02:24.970> new<00:02:25.000> grip<00:02:25.660> tape

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:25.900 
recommend buying some new grip tape

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:30.840 
recommend buying some new grip tape
instead<00:02:26.890> of<00:02:27.130> using<00:02:27.310> the<00:02:27.960> FBS<00:02:28.960> tape<00:02:29.620> that<00:02:30.550> comes

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:30.850 
instead of using the FBS tape that comes

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:35.780 
instead of using the FBS tape that comes
stuck<00:02:31.450> with<00:02:31.630> it<00:02:31.660> or<00:02:32.820> actually<00:02:33.820> just<00:02:34.090> buy<00:02:34.750> some

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
stuck with it or actually just buy some

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:43.660 
stuck with it or actually just buy some
higher<00:02:36.790> quality<00:02:37.390> FPS<00:02:38.380> a<00:02:38.590> pro<00:02:38.860> tape

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:43.670 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:48.680 

pretty<00:02:44.670> good<00:02:44.850> trucks<00:02:45.440> kind<00:02:46.440> of<00:02:46.680> like<00:02:47.120> it<00:02:48.120> kind
