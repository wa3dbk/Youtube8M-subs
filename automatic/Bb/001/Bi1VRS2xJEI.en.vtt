00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:18.500
 we have 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:40.070
 So in the time we are in 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:43.100
 that's why you're experiencing so much now 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:44.809
 over 70 projects independent projects 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:46.600
 promoted and we have experienced things 

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:49.309
 Again, that will be us both 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:50.750
 have touched us very much 

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:53.480
 and not only and I believe these 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:55.909
 whole big steps bambi family die 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:58.670
 we have become meanwhile and up 

00:00:55.909 --> 00:01:01.339
 On the other hand, it makes us very happy 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:03.409
 happy to see how many initiatives 

00:01:01.339 --> 00:01:05.810
 There are people in Germany where people 

00:01:03.409 --> 00:01:07.490
 Just decide to others 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:09.560
 helping and helping children as well 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:11.140
 to help families in need that is glad 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:14.000
 a very 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:15.649
 There are many initiatives that are going on 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.910
 apply directly to us 

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:22.910
 but we are also actively looking for it ourselves 

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:25.630
 and very, very, very, very many 

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:25.630
 a lot of private engagement 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:46.979
 I think it's very nice to be here 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.630
 has a really good reason and 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:50.549
 to come together with colleagues because 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.890
 of course I will be many friends today 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:54.720
 and colleagues meet out of the 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.369
 television world and from the media world and 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.630
 if all this for the good purpose 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:00.090
 it is all the more beautiful 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:03.420
 I always find something important to donate 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:05.820
 and that we are here at all 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.619
 and different charity event 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:10.590
 can support the whole so, too 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:12.330
 and tribute to it just one 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:14.100
 event for children and that is 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:15.750
 anyway, always very close to my heart 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:17.730
 I think you always have something for 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:19.560
 the future must be for our offspring 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:21.930
 It is nice if we have the opportunity 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:24.630
 have the attention of this evening 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:25.980
 to use to drum this evening 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:28.769
 but also to donate properly 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:30.900
 and that a lot of money comes together and we 

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:32.130
 Introduce the projects today and the 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.700
 hopefully an even wider one 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:34.700
