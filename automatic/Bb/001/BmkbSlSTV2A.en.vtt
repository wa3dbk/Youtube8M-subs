00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.910
 next things let's make smoothies 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.219
 natural with things that we have in the 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.200
 house goes supermarket absolutely 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:37.469

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:39.329
 take care of your whole body first ingredient 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:40.949
 or first mix we have it to 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:42.809
 continued wanted for you 

00:00:40.949 --> 00:00:45.690
 well let's put is three pieces of 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:47.579
 celery a sprig of parsley the juice of 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.309
 three oranges or two oranges itself 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:52.309
 complete and we're going to put two kiwis a 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:54.780
 little ice and sweetener to taste 

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:56.699
 diet so that this does not go to 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.589
 produce more calories that will do 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.719
 this is going to purge the body 

00:00:58.589 --> 00:01:03.180
 we have vitamins present in 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:07.500
 extraction of we have fiber 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:10.020
 we have good and walk we have the sport 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:13.080
 before parsley and is a diuretic 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:15.030
 parsley at the same time so once 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.520
 Take once a day or several times 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.830
 during these 24 hours of love , be it 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.700
 this 24 hours of work the celery the 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.710
 party that we are going to do now 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.690
 initially it can be taken twice at 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:28.729
 day and then we will see others who are 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:28.729
 once a day and another before lunch 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:35.610
 although thick we put it and it remains 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.020
 Delgadito has already done well 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.940
 which can be adjusted the amount of 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:43.850
 ice and the amount of guilt of all 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:43.850
 we start with the recipe 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:50.130
 a serving of fruit that you need 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:53.190
 the day and vitamin c that more already three 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.380
 small pieces of celery can be chopped with 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:02:00.740
 hands 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:02:03.799
 the fiber has to get to this 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:07.340
 let's apply a twig or two twigs 

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:10.850
 of parsley that the parsley is diuretic and 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:15.760
 detoxifying and desinflamar 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:15.760
 we're going to put oranges 

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:21.410
 I like the whole orange more for 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:23.090
 Let the pulp remain and give us that texture 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:26.530
 thicker than from a smoothie 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:26.530
 we are going to put a little water 

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:36.470
 if not 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:38.400
 if you do not want it 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:40.950
 and this family 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:43.530
 a little ice in the summer to be 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:48.080
 fresh and always in the morning is rich 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:51.030
 take something that tries to rich and already 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:52.770
 girl if you want to lower these 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:55.440
 small rolls fat burners 

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:57.400
 drain your body sweep it in front it's not going to 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:59.879
 pay with the moon 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:59.879

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:40.460
 the ingredient that we are using 

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:43.790

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:46.430
