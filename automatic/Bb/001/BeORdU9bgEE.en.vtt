have much experience being president
because<00:01:01.000> he<00:01:01.180> was<00:01:01.329> just<00:01:01.539> open<00:01:01.930> out-of-the-box

00:01:02.369 --> 00:01:02.379 
because he was just open out-of-the-box

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:05.399 
because he was just open out-of-the-box
and<00:01:03.000> there<00:01:04.000> were<00:01:04.149> four<00:01:04.629> double<00:01:05.289> A<00:01:05.379> batteries

that were just put inside of him so he

00:01:08.319 --> 00:01:11.370 
that were just put inside of him so he
does<00:01:08.590> need<00:01:08.800> a<00:01:08.830> little<00:01:08.979> time<00:01:09.390> to<00:01:10.390> figure<00:01:11.080> out

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:11.380
