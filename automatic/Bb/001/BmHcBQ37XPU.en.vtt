00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:09.560
 Mr. Gates, I would like to know who is 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:09.560
 you really 

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:19.570
 you want this guy with his house his 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:22.039
 parties and those extravagant costumes 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:25.250
 Y 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:28.179
 and we were born different what 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:28.179
 we carry in the blood 

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:34.930
 and nothing you do or dream you will 

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:34.930
 change that 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:47.610
 Gatsby had a great vision of his 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:49.740
 life since childhood 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.220
 I'm going to make things like 

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:56.080
 before 

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:58.840
 only you and me there is no fire that can 

00:00:56.080 --> 00:01:01.620
 turn off the fairy tale that housed 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:01.620
 in your heart 

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:13.060
 all this is the product of your imagination 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:19.210
 but I had the uncomfortable feeling of 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:19.210
 that kept secrets 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.930
 I spoke with you 

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:37.440
 do not do it 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:54.560
 and goes beyond it 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:59.600
 and they go beyond taba 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:06.620
 with types and can not walk loose 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.620
 she 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:19.540
 i 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:26.660
 and my life 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:28.750
 forget it has to be a promotion 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:28.750
 meteoric
