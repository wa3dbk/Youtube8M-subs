uh I think this actually looks a lot

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:00.379 
uh I think this actually looks a lot
better<00:02:56.879> than<00:02:57.150> his<00:02:57.269> model<00:02:57.629> in<00:02:57.750> the<00:02:57.870> show<00:02:59.389> maybe

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:00.389 
better than his model in the show maybe

00:03:00.389 --> 00:03:01.610 
better than his model in the show maybe
that's<00:03:00.629> just<00:03:00.719> because<00:03:00.870> I'm<00:03:01.109> a<00:03:01.139> fan<00:03:01.379> of<00:03:01.409> the
