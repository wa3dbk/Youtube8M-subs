00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:05.490
 also for my first youtube video 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.410
 I'm a very original 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:09.920
 theme selected the first 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:12.450
 homemade oil change faster 

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:14.400
 Let's see which of the bigger ones 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:17.640
 challenge becomes that is our ford 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:20.640
 mondeo mk3 our family carriage 2.0 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.980
 tdci 115 ps and loud user manual 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.320
 go there 6 liters of oil 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:28.680
 I have worried that before as well 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:30.420
 the corresponding oil filter that is one 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.880
 filter use there is in the cartridge 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:39.210
 purely turned and a suitable one 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:42.920
 Direction wrestling was there that the 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.920
 sealing ring beautiful 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:47.690
 it is enough for the oil drain plug 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:49.610
 actually this thin sealing ring 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:52.220
 who sits in between replacing 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:53.330
 I really hewed one out and 

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:56.360
 the whole screw is new to me 

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:58.580
 bought to drain I have such a 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:01.309
 10 liter canister was priming 

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:03.739
 I have the side cut in it 

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:05.089
 and it fits exactly and the car like that 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:07.850
 that you still have minimal slot to 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:08.619
 I hope I will have the oil and work 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:11.540
 catch 

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:14.840
 that's the car I'll show you this way 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:20.210
 roughly where the screw sits to drain 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:22.759
 It is expected that this is still there 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:25.399
 closer and up there with the round thing 

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:28.190
 the 6 km down the round black that 

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:30.140
 the container for the oil filter is the 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:32.000
 you also change later and there 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:35.300
 we'll do that with one 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.710
 13 0 on the slide and a 36 win 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:40.910
 key the neighbor more 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:43.220
 Fortunately, it was possible to borrow there 

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:44.750
 I'm already on with the 13 - the oil 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:48.740
 drain plug to open it on 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:49.819
 beginning relatively firm and bacon there must 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:51.500
 is already so struggling a bit and 

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:53.119
 if it is then without a lift then it is 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:55.100
 that's really difficult 

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:57.050
 but it works you come there 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:58.429
 reasonably well and when the shell 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:02.300
 still a bit flatter who is still 

00:01:58.429 --> 00:02:06.020
 better to go at the beginning you screwed 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:08.420
 there neatly relatively long screw 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:09.770
 Lage are a few profits here 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:11.450
 is just the light department 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:11.840
 with the camera departments the ins 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:15.680
 enclosure 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:17.209
 you can feel it quickly before and at the end of the 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:21.260
 Of course, it always works 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:22.580
 easier and yes at the end can 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.590
 the last turn then completely 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:27.500
 Good with the hand away and puts 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:30.020
 exactly at the moment festmist actually 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:32.599
 I wanted to take disposable gloves the oil 

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:34.130
 is really a big mess and there 

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:37.280
 you should really watch that for a start 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:38.870
 this surge of tc comes out right 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:41.030
 in the wandering meets and not over it 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:42.920
 also spills out and to the other that 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:45.140
 Also the floor is well covered because 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:46.880
 that every drop of real giant stains 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:49.370
 the same leaves which is oil the old 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:51.140
 the real suction the longer then the whole 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:54.500
 drips and bleeds like the professional 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:55.310
 says the more of the oil sludge and im 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:57.860
 old oil 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:59.720
 can flow out and you have that 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:02.330
 no longer in the engine room and therefore 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:04.630
 Take me there where I'm out of time 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:09.140
 drink coffee tea or whatever 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:11.290
 and leave the drip when you're there 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:14.060
 continue to take the bit of old oil and 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:16.010
 wets that on the 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:17.660
 Rubber seal then you will be nice to me 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:20.599
 fluffy and goes in and seals 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:22.310
 also good and get later at 

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:23.690
 next oil change the seal also good 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:26.510
 unscrewed again and debug not so 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:27.170
 then firmly with the 13 - again nice 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:29.150
 tighten 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:31.730
 Next, solve with you 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:33.890
 the 36 key will gain the cover 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:35.299
 from the oil filter just a bit 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:36.860
 make it easy and then you get the 

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:37.760
 rest really well with the 

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:39.799
 hand down 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:42.580
 The hands are now completely messed up 

00:03:39.799 --> 00:03:44.660
 insofar well then it does not matter 

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:47.090
 while really dirty then worth it 

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:48.950
 the hand washing at least loud 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:51.110
 Operating instructions are around 200 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:51.590
 milliliter in this oil filter also 

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:54.049
 in there 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:55.430
 that means there is one now 

00:03:54.049 --> 00:03:57.530
 small gap to expect 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:59.570
 One should also have good in the tub 

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:02.630
 catch the Sun a bit 

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:05.470
 let drop because as I said that too 

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:05.470
 still a lot of oil in it 

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:10.400
 in filter you can easily 

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:15.739
 pull out the pure stuck the old one 

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:17.299
 seal in and the new first 

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:19.970
 of course, a little clean up na 

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:22.160
 Clear last oil then a bit out 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:23.900
 vision, he is all messed up here thinks 

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:26.240
 be sure to cover everything well 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:28.310
 This is really a crazy mess oil 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:30.919
 is really quite capable of war and 

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:34.910
 accordingly, of course, everywhere 

00:04:30.919 --> 00:04:36.919
 it drips and already has its reasons 

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:38.680
 Women from the workshops often quite 

00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:41.660
 Nice black looks on the floor 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:44.960
 then , for the first time, put the seal 

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:47.180
 again on it make such a thing 

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:51.289
 bit old oil on it to the 

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:55.039
 nicely becomes fluffy and ultimately easy 

00:04:51.289 --> 00:04:58.430
 so very easy then click the new one 

00:04:55.039 --> 00:05:00.680
 oil filter back in and so nasen down 

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:04.130
 so plastic nose pack their easy 

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:06.320
 pure and if it is secure 

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:08.630
 we can see the bottom and we are the 

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:11.599
 Thread makes the thread again 

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:13.870
 a bit clean and then we turn 

00:05:11.599 --> 00:05:16.340
 because just in there 

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:18.050
 it's only so far with the hand that clever 

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:20.419
 now with gloves that makes sense 

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:21.770
 because now his hands are dirty now 

00:05:20.419 --> 00:05:25.190
 you can pull over it 

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:27.889
 one man one the remaining trains then 

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:29.479
 nice wrench also determine the 

00:05:27.889 --> 00:05:30.860
 need not be determined, the thunder 

00:05:29.479 --> 00:05:32.539
 is a suit moment I think of 

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:35.570
 20 newton meters on it or something 

00:05:32.539 --> 00:05:36.320
 it is enough if the good hand-warm firmly 

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:38.419
 is drawn 

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:40.699
 you have nothing there is a tear 

00:05:38.419 --> 00:05:41.870
 plastic thread which is still winning 

00:05:40.699 --> 00:05:45.560
 is big enough can actually 

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:47.389
 nothing happens the rest happens 

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:50.270
 Now over days you can be pleasant 

00:05:47.389 --> 00:05:53.719
 then we do the bonnet 

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:55.219
 sound the lid off the wildecker 

00:05:53.719 --> 00:05:56.810
 of course, so away then find the back 

00:05:55.219 --> 00:05:58.210
 and also do not forget him again 

00:05:56.810 --> 00:06:01.310
 screw it on 

00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:02.930
 We now meet the amount of oil a the 

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:05.090
 required is 6 liters are here 

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:07.039
 As I said, I think it would be real 

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:08.419
 a funnel to have been more practical 

00:06:07.039 --> 00:06:10.789
 take and if only one sawed off 

00:06:08.419 --> 00:06:12.710
 bottle or similar is because the 

00:06:10.789 --> 00:06:14.330
 Danger that somehow when filling 

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:16.340
 the half goes wrong maybe 

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:19.250
 but relatively large and that is one 

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:20.900
 Giant sowing does not accept that 

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:22.550
 how to make a funnel 

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:24.320
 well here everything is good again 

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:26.000
 gone when the oil is a nice 

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:30.370
 we have to distribute again 

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:33.770
 oil level if then everything went well 

00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:34.730
 then we can shut up and 

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:36.980
 drive again 

00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:39.230
 perhaps do not forget also the 

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:40.760
 kilometerstand and to the date 

00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:42.340
 note when he made the oil change 

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:45.410
 I then you have a good control 

00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:47.480
 when the next change is due me 

00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:48.710
 hope you enjoyed it helps 

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:50.780
 One or the other sometimes 

00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:54.220
 even to trust it and hopefully 

00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:54.220
 until the next video until then bye
