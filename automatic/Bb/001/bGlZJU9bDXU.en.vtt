it's<00:01:33.110> always<00:01:33.320> funny<00:01:33.650> in<00:01:33.830> films<00:01:34.160> when<00:01:34.310> a<00:01:34.340> person

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:34.760 
it's always funny in films when a person

it's always funny in films when a person
has<00:01:34.850> a<00:01:34.910> gun<00:01:35.120> that<00:01:35.300> runs<00:01:35.510> out<00:01:35.690> of<00:01:35.720> ammo<00:01:35.990> so<00:01:36.320> they

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:36.440 
has a gun that runs out of ammo so they

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:38.170 
has a gun that runs out of ammo so they
throw<00:01:36.740> the<00:01:36.890> gun<00:01:37.040> at<00:01:37.130> their<00:01:37.280> opponent<00:01:37.730> but<00:01:38.090> at

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:38.180 
throw the gun at their opponent but at

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:39.460 
throw the gun at their opponent but at
least<00:01:38.270> doing<00:01:38.540> that<00:01:38.780> with<00:01:38.900> your<00:01:39.020> super<00:01:39.260> scope

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:39.470

least doing that with your super scope
could<00:01:39.680> actually<00:01:39.920> be<00:01:40.250> beneficial

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:44.330 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:47.390 

hothead<00:01:45.330> it's<00:01:46.110> a<00:01:46.260> decent<00:01:46.590> enough<00:01:46.830> idea<00:01:47.220> you

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:47.400 
hothead it's a decent enough idea you

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:49.040 
hothead it's a decent enough idea you
throw<00:01:47.610> the<00:01:47.790> fireball<00:01:48.240> it<00:01:48.360> attaches<00:01:48.690> to<00:01:48.840> the

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:49.050 
throw the fireball it attaches to the

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:50.840 
throw the fireball it attaches to the
stage<00:01:49.350> and<00:01:49.590> rolls<00:01:49.770> around<00:01:49.860> in<00:01:50.250> damaging<00:01:50.700> all

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
stage and rolls around in damaging all

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.000 
stage and rolls around in damaging all
the<00:01:51.000> other<00:01:51.120> characters<00:01:51.660> problem<00:01:52.290> is<00:01:52.440> most<00:01:52.890> of

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:53.010 
the other characters problem is most of

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:54.260 
the other characters problem is most of
your<00:01:53.130> time<00:01:53.310> it<00:01:53.550> will<00:01:53.640> just<00:01:53.820> roll<00:01:54.000> off<00:01:54.240> the

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
your time it will just roll off the

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.360 
your time it will just roll off the
stage<00:01:54.630> or<00:01:54.900> if<00:01:55.050> it<00:01:55.200> lands<00:01:55.380> on<00:01:55.500> a<00:01:55.560> platform<00:01:56.130> it'll

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:56.370 
stage or if it lands on a platform it'll

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:58.070 
stage or if it lands on a platform it'll
just<00:01:56.400> roll<00:01:56.760> off<00:01:56.970> the<00:01:57.000> edge<00:01:57.180> of<00:01:57.330> that<00:01:57.540> so<00:01:57.810> most

00:01:58.070 --> 00:01:58.080 
just roll off the edge of that so most

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:00.260 
just roll off the edge of that so most
likely<00:01:58.470> you'll<00:01:58.650> get<00:01:58.800> one<00:01:59.070> maybe<00:01:59.430> two<00:01:59.790> hits<00:02:00.060> and

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
likely you'll get one maybe two hits and

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.630 
likely you'll get one maybe two hits and
that's<00:02:00.390> it<00:02:00.780> if<00:02:01.170> it<00:02:01.470> gets<00:02:01.590> hit<00:02:01.890> by<00:02:02.070> a<00:02:02.100> fire<00:02:02.370> or

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
that's it if it gets hit by a fire or

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.250 
that's it if it gets hit by a fire or
electric<00:02:03.090> attack<00:02:03.360> it<00:02:03.540> gets<00:02:03.720> bigger<00:02:04.020> and<00:02:04.170> more

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:04.260 
electric attack it gets bigger and more

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:05.900 
electric attack it gets bigger and more
damaging<00:02:04.770> but<00:02:05.070> the<00:02:05.220> chances<00:02:05.640> of<00:02:05.670> that's

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:05.910 
damaging but the chances of that's

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:07.610 
damaging but the chances of that's
happening<00:02:06.300> are<00:02:06.420> so<00:02:06.570> slim<00:02:06.930> you<00:02:07.170> might<00:02:07.410> as<00:02:07.590> well

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:07.620 
happening are so slim you might as well

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:14.270 
happening are so slim you might as well
not<00:02:08.070> bother<00:02:11.810> the<00:02:12.810> smart<00:02:13.110> bomb<00:02:13.350> whenever<00:02:14.130> I'll

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280 
not bother the smart bomb whenever I'll

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:15.740 
not bother the smart bomb whenever I'll
get<00:02:14.430> caught<00:02:14.610> in<00:02:14.790> one<00:02:14.910> of<00:02:15.000> these<00:02:15.120> going<00:02:15.360> off<00:02:15.570> I

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
get caught in one of these going off I

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:17.870 
get caught in one of these going off I
always<00:02:16.200> panic<00:02:16.560> they're<00:02:17.010> pretty<00:02:17.250> damaging<00:02:17.700> but

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:17.880 
always panic they're pretty damaging but

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:19.250 
always panic they're pretty damaging but
don't<00:02:18.090> have<00:02:18.300> a<00:02:18.330> huge<00:02:18.660> amount<00:02:18.960> of<00:02:19.020> knock-back

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
don't have a huge amount of knock-back

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.350 
don't have a huge amount of knock-back
so<00:02:19.680> the<00:02:19.770> chance<00:02:20.010> of<00:02:20.130> being<00:02:20.340> cured<00:02:20.580> is<00:02:20.940> never<00:02:21.210> as

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
so the chance of being cured is never as

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.180 
so the chance of being cured is never as
high<00:02:21.570> as<00:02:21.750> I<00:02:21.840> expect<00:02:22.170> it<00:02:22.290> to<00:02:22.320> be<00:02:22.440> but<00:02:22.890> it's<00:02:23.010> still

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
high as I expect it to be but it's still

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:24.500 
high as I expect it to be but it's still
unnerving<00:02:23.580> being<00:02:23.880> caught<00:02:24.120> in<00:02:24.270> the<00:02:24.300> explosion

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
unnerving being caught in the explosion

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:26.690 
unnerving being caught in the explosion
it's<00:02:25.380> great<00:02:25.740> throwing<00:02:26.040> them<00:02:26.220> at<00:02:26.310> a<00:02:26.340> group<00:02:26.550> of

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
it's great throwing them at a group of

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:28.100 
it's great throwing them at a group of
foes<00:02:26.910> watching<00:02:27.300> their<00:02:27.420> damage<00:02:27.720> counters

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
foes watching their damage counters

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:29.780 
foes watching their damage counters
increase<00:02:28.440> knowing<00:02:28.710> the<00:02:28.890> boom<00:02:29.190> is<00:02:29.430> soon<00:02:29.640> to

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
increase knowing the boom is soon to

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:31.910

follow<00:02:29.820> you<00:02:30.570> do<00:02:30.720> get<00:02:30.960> the<00:02:31.080> odd<00:02:31.230> dud<00:02:31.530> every<00:02:31.800> now

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:33.570 
and again which is really annoying but

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:43.610 
and again which is really annoying but
it's<00:02:33.720> still<00:02:33.930> a<00:02:33.990> cool<00:02:34.260> weapon

00:05:14.099 --> 00:05:15.770 
a tad difficult to aim and get the
timing<00:05:14.340> right<00:05:14.580> to<00:05:14.729> destroy<00:05:15.090> your<00:05:15.270> opponent

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:15.780 
timing right to destroy your opponent

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:18.379 
timing right to destroy your opponent
but<00:05:15.960> even<00:05:16.530> so<00:05:16.740> if<00:05:17.069> death<00:05:17.430> was<00:05:17.639> in<00:05:17.789> a<00:05:17.849> ball<00:05:18.090> form

00:05:18.379 --> 00:05:18.389 
but even so if death was in a ball form

00:05:18.389 --> 00:05:26.480 
but even so if death was in a ball form
this<00:05:18.810> is<00:05:18.990> what<00:05:19.169> he<00:05:19.319> would<00:05:19.409> be

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:26.490 

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:29.700 

mr.<00:05:27.490> Sasson<00:05:28.030> you<00:05:28.390> probably<00:05:28.810> saw<00:05:29.110> this<00:05:29.320> coming

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:29.710 
mr. Sasson you probably saw this coming

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:31.410 
mr. Sasson you probably saw this coming
but<00:05:29.860> these<00:05:30.040> are<00:05:30.280> ridiculous

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:31.420 
but these are ridiculous

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:33.570 
but these are ridiculous
you<00:05:31.570> throw<00:05:31.780> at<00:05:31.990> your<00:05:32.080> opponent<00:05:32.620> it<00:05:32.740> goes<00:05:32.950> they

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:33.580
