00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:18.220 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:20.770 

I'm<00:01:19.220> behind<00:01:19.460> the<00:01:19.670> wheel<00:01:19.700> of<00:01:20.000> the<00:01:20.150> Audi<00:01:20.420> and

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:20.780 
I'm behind the wheel of the Audi and

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:22.960 
I'm behind the wheel of the Audi and
Andres<00:01:21.380> behind<00:01:21.740> the<00:01:21.860> wheel<00:01:22.010> of<00:01:22.250> the<00:01:22.369> BMW<00:01:22.940> and

Andres behind the wheel of the BMW and

Andres behind the wheel of the BMW and
in<00:01:23.270> the<00:01:23.390> slow<00:01:23.600> motion<00:01:23.810> replay<00:01:24.080> it<00:01:24.500> certainly

00:01:24.999 --> 00:01:25.009 
in the slow motion replay it certainly

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:26.469 
in the slow motion replay it certainly
looks<00:01:25.280> like<00:01:25.340> I<00:01:25.549> fell<00:01:25.759> asleep<00:01:25.880> at<00:01:26.240> the<00:01:26.300> wheel

00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:26.479 
looks like I fell asleep at the wheel

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:29.200 
looks like I fell asleep at the wheel
but<00:01:27.200> believe<00:01:27.500> me<00:01:27.530> my<00:01:27.860> foot<00:01:28.550> was<00:01:28.759> pushing<00:01:29.119> on

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:29.210 
but believe me my foot was pushing on

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:30.999 
but believe me my foot was pushing on
the<00:01:29.330> accelerator<00:01:29.360> so<00:01:30.080> hard<00:01:30.320> I<00:01:30.470> almost<00:01:30.500> pushed

00:01:30.999 --> 00:01:31.009 
the accelerator so hard I almost pushed

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:33.070 
the accelerator so hard I almost pushed
it<00:01:31.130> through<00:01:31.250> the<00:01:31.460> firewall<00:01:32.000> so<00:01:32.240> what<00:01:32.750> happened

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:33.080 
it through the firewall so what happened

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:42.430 
it through the firewall so what happened
well<00:01:33.649> the<00:01:33.950> answer<00:01:34.220> is<00:01:34.250> simple<00:01:34.340> turbo<00:01:35.300> lag<00:01:41.440> we

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:42.440 
well the answer is simple turbo lag we

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:43.990 
well the answer is simple turbo lag we
couldn't<00:01:42.740> believe<00:01:42.830> the<00:01:43.009> results<00:01:43.429> either<00:01:43.640> so

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:44.000 
couldn't believe the results either so

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.210 
couldn't believe the results either so
we<00:01:44.149> had<00:01:44.330> a<00:01:44.360> redo<00:01:44.810> we<00:01:45.229> did<00:01:45.410> the<00:01:45.500> race<00:01:45.679> again<00:01:46.009> and

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:46.220 
we had a redo we did the race again and

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:48.370 
we had a redo we did the race again and
this<00:01:46.460> time<00:01:46.520> I<00:01:46.820> set<00:01:47.179> up<00:01:47.270> the<00:01:47.390> solo<00:01:47.600> DL<00:01:48.050> in<00:01:48.289> the

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:48.380 
this time I set up the solo DL in the

00:01:48.380 --> 00:02:00.999 
this time I set up the solo DL in the
Audi<00:01:48.530> and<00:01:48.890> guess<00:01:49.070> what

00:02:00.999 --> 00:02:01.009 

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:03.709 

so<00:02:02.009> of<00:02:02.130> course<00:02:02.340> next<00:02:02.670> we<00:02:02.880> decided<00:02:03.270> to<00:02:03.329> test<00:02:03.570> a

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
so of course next we decided to test a

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:06.529 
so of course next we decided to test a
BMW<00:02:04.380> from<00:02:04.560> zero<00:02:04.920> to<00:02:05.009> 60<00:02:05.429> and<00:02:05.670> they'll<00:02:06.420> be

00:02:06.529 --> 00:02:06.539 
BMW from zero to 60 and they'll be

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:23.990 
BMW from zero to 60 and they'll be
surprised<00:02:06.960> by<00:02:07.200> the<00:02:07.259> results<00:02:11.900> here<00:02:12.900> we<00:02:12.959> go

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:30.930 

6.70<00:02:26.040> 6.70<00:02:27.040> but<00:02:27.730> in<00:02:28.000> drag<00:02:28.960> race<00:02:29.230> because<00:02:29.940> the

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:30.940 
6.70 6.70 but in drag race because the

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:35.580 
6.70 6.70 but in drag race because the
Audi<00:02:31.560> just<00:02:32.560> won't<00:02:32.890> launch<00:02:33.840> this<00:02:34.840> cars<00:02:35.140> faster

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.590 
Audi just won't launch this cars faster

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:38.730 
Audi just won't launch this cars faster
very<00:02:36.280> interesting<00:02:36.880> results<00:02:37.330> indeed<00:02:37.740> very

launch control okay just do a brake
torque<00:03:22.570> gain<00:03:22.840> and<00:03:23.440> there<00:03:23.620> we<00:03:23.709> go<00:03:23.830> that's<00:03:24.220> a

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:24.310 
torque gain and there we go that's a

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:26.380 
torque gain and there we go that's a
better<00:03:24.489> launch<00:03:24.700> yeah

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:26.390 
better launch yeah

the Audi s3 as launch control for the
drag<00:04:07.750> race<00:04:08.019> well<00:04:08.859> we<00:04:09.010> figure<00:04:09.280> in<00:04:09.370> the<00:04:09.459> real

00:04:09.629 --> 00:04:09.639 
drag race well we figure in the real

00:04:09.639 --> 00:04:11.580 
drag race well we figure in the real
world<00:04:09.909> people<00:04:10.480> at<00:04:10.659> stoplights<00:04:10.900> don't<00:04:11.440> have

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:11.590 
world people at stoplights don't have

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:13.259 
world people at stoplights don't have
time<00:04:11.889> to<00:04:12.069> engage<00:04:12.370> launch<00:04:12.700> control<00:04:13.090> they<00:04:13.239> just

00:04:13.259 --> 00:04:13.269 
time to engage launch control they just

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:15.839 
time to engage launch control they just
floor<00:04:13.750> it<00:04:13.780> but<00:04:14.139> it's<00:04:14.349> a<00:04:14.470> fair<00:04:14.709> question<00:04:14.889> so<00:04:15.400> we

00:04:15.839 --> 00:04:15.849 
floor it but it's a fair question so we

00:04:15.849 --> 00:04:18.060 
floor it but it's a fair question so we
decided<00:04:16.150> to<00:04:16.269> use<00:04:16.359> launch<00:04:16.720> control<00:04:16.810> and<00:04:17.350> do<00:04:17.919> a

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:18.070 
decided to use launch control and do a

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:34.840 
decided to use launch control and do a
zero<00:04:18.459> to<00:04:18.549> sixty<00:04:18.880> run<00:04:19.060> in<00:04:19.209> the<00:04:19.449> Audi

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:34.850 

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:39.710 

okay<00:04:35.850> here<00:04:36.000> we<00:04:36.030> go<00:04:36.420> hit<00:04:37.020> the<00:04:37.260> brake<00:04:38.420> that's<00:04:39.420> on

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:39.720 
okay here we go hit the brake that's on

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:42.800 
okay here we go hit the brake that's on
control<00:04:40.170> just<00:04:40.920> let<00:04:41.070> it<00:04:41.160> go<00:04:41.450> that's<00:04:42.450> a<00:04:42.660> lot

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:42.810 
control just let it go that's a lot

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:45.629 
control just let it go that's a lot
better

00:04:45.629 --> 00:04:45.639 

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:50.219 

yes<00:04:46.389> I<00:04:47.129> saw<00:04:48.129> there<00:04:48.580> we<00:04:48.729> have<00:04:48.909> it<00:04:49.060> five<00:04:49.689> point

00:04:50.219 --> 00:04:50.229 
yes I saw there we have it five point

00:04:50.229 --> 00:04:53.399 
yes I saw there we have it five point
four<00:04:50.530> eight<00:04:50.830> five<00:04:51.219> point<00:04:51.669> four<00:04:51.969> eight<00:04:52.409> that's

00:04:53.399 --> 00:04:53.409 
four eight five point four eight that's

00:04:53.409 --> 00:05:02.570 
four eight five point four eight that's
don't<00:04:53.740> a<00:04:53.889> lot<00:04:54.159> faster

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:02.580 

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:04.679 

let<00:05:03.580> me<00:05:03.669> see<00:05:03.789> if<00:05:03.849> I<00:05:03.909> can<00:05:04.060> do<00:05:04.150> it<00:05:04.180> one<00:05:04.330> more<00:05:04.509> time

00:05:04.679 --> 00:05:04.689 
let me see if I can do it one more time

00:05:04.689 --> 00:05:07.170 
let me see if I can do it one more time
and<00:05:05.530> maybe<00:05:05.740> get<00:05:06.039> just<00:05:06.310> a<00:05:06.490> little<00:05:06.520> bit<00:05:06.969> more

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:07.180 
and maybe get just a little bit more

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:13.290 
and maybe get just a little bit more
time<00:05:07.419> out<00:05:07.569> of<00:05:07.689> this<00:05:07.780> because<00:05:09.689> otherwise<00:05:12.300> we're

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:13.300 
time out of this because otherwise we're

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:15.209 
time out of this because otherwise we're
just<00:05:13.330> not<00:05:13.689> getting<00:05:13.810> kind<00:05:14.680> of<00:05:14.710> speed<00:05:14.949> we<00:05:15.099> need

00:05:15.209 --> 00:05:15.219 
just not getting kind of speed we need

00:05:15.219 --> 00:05:23.680 
just not getting kind of speed we need
alright<00:05:15.550> here<00:05:15.699> we<00:05:15.729> go

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:23.690 

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:29.050 

DSCR<00:05:25.220> launched<00:05:26.220> in<00:05:26.400> July<00:05:26.780> no<00:05:27.780> like<00:05:28.080> a<00:05:28.680> Oh

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:29.060 
DSCR launched in July no like a Oh

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:32.970 
DSCR launched in July no like a Oh
didn't<00:05:30.060> work<00:05:30.180> that<00:05:30.210> time

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:32.980 

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:36.830 

then<00:05:33.280> get<00:05:33.460> at<00:05:33.550> that<00:05:33.670> time<00:05:33.910> can<00:05:34.360> be<00:05:34.480> slower<00:05:35.730> 6.3

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:36.840 
then get at that time can be slower 6.3

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:40.470 
then get at that time can be slower 6.3
if<00:05:37.840> but<00:05:38.680> we<00:05:38.920> have<00:05:39.250> a<00:05:39.280> fast<00:05:39.730> time<00:05:40.000> using<00:05:40.210> launch

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:40.480 
if but we have a fast time using launch

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:49.700 
if but we have a fast time using launch
control<00:05:40.930> so<00:05:41.970> yeah<00:05:43.110> it's<00:05:44.110> good<00:05:44.320> ID<00:05:44.410> but<00:05:44.680> you

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:49.710 

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:54.020 

know<00:05:50.710> there's<00:05:50.950> still<00:05:51.130> a<00:05:51.700> heck<00:05:52.300> of<00:05:52.330> a<00:05:52.540> lot<00:05:52.720> of

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:54.030 
know there's still a heck of a lot of

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:56.910 
know there's still a heck of a lot of
turbo<00:05:55.030> lag<00:05:55.240> only<00:05:55.630> initially<00:05:56.050> on<00:05:56.200> the<00:05:56.380> throttle

otherwise you know when you're cruising
along<00:06:02.530> you<00:06:02.860> floor<00:06:03.130> it<00:06:03.160> it's<00:06:03.880> really<00:06:04.360> fast<00:06:04.600> but

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:05.470 
along you floor it it's really fast but

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:09.090
