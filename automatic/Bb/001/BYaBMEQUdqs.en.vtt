went<00:02:01.920> back<00:02:02.130> to<00:02:02.310> its<00:02:02.490> original<00:02:02.580> stage<00:02:03.119> because

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
went back to its original stage because

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.690 
went back to its original stage because
it's<00:02:03.600> not<00:02:03.780> nowhere<00:02:04.200> near<00:02:04.619> the<00:02:05.159> way<00:02:05.280> it<00:02:05.369> was<00:02:05.549> at

it's not nowhere near the way it was at
first<00:02:05.880> I<00:02:06.119> was<00:02:06.270> probably<00:02:06.570> back<00:02:07.530> to<00:02:07.710> its<00:02:07.890> normal

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:08.630 
first I was probably back to its normal

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:11.320
