00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
like $2 40 at the moment which you can

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.940 
like $2 40 at the moment which you can
then<00:00:41.010> convert<00:00:41.280> in<00:00:41.579> to<00:00:41.790> reclaim<00:00:42.090> metal<00:00:42.800> if<00:00:43.800> you

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
approximately $5 plus the key price if

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.270 
approximately $5 plus the key price if
you<00:00:50.940> do<00:00:51.090> this<00:00:51.270> right<00:00:51.510> so<00:00:51.750> first<00:00:52.739> I'm<00:00:52.980> gonna<00:00:53.100> go
