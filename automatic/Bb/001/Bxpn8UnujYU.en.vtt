00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:04.980
 good 

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:09.080
 first question let you grow the 

00:00:07.669 --> 00:00:12.289
 beard or mustache his head during 

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:15.189
 your matches in parentheses otherwise pitch 

00:00:12.289 --> 00:00:17.810
 is pretty ugly what that but let's give 

00:00:15.189 --> 00:00:20.450
 so frejus that I take the time to myself 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:22.099
 shave more often that's my wife she 

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:25.570
 says to me in addition will be stop all but some 

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:28.099
 time I do not take the time 

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:29.750
 second question what does it mean to be a 

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:36.970
 the most beautiful league players 1 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:39.620
 behind the opera of course good fun 

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:42.500
 after knowing that of halo case we know 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:44.570
 not have to perfect the ranking have 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:47.809
 in any case me it's nice I hope 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:51.290
 that there are girls who voted when 

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:52.879
 even enough ranking sees the third 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:55.989
 question that for you has the best 

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:57.830
 dress style in the team 

00:00:55.989 --> 00:01:00.439
 frankly for me what he dresses 

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:02.960
 the best is who has his own style 

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:05.089
 Obame is always small of 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:07.430
 somewhat extravagant clothes is the year 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:09.590
 sequins rhinestones everywhere 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:12.140
 but it suits him really well so I say 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:15.010
 robin the rapee it's still 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:17.050
 better than the quenelle not true 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:19.300
 it's true I tasted I did not know 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:21.670
 before arriving here and it's true that 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:27.220
 it's very good I do not like dumplings 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:28.840
 so good it's like that it's not what 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:30.700
 is the best partner for a tarot 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:32.770
 what table composition for a 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:33.910
 endless tarot so it depends if I 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:38.620
 want to take money I play with 

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:41.350
 renault renaud cohade baky and fabien 

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:43.060
 lemoine and if it's for who a little more 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:47.979
 of levels I will play with battlès 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:49.180
 perrin and mignot here but it's good 

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:52.690
 on behalf of the frozen money chrono 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:58.150
 it's nice between bärtschi his way 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:02:00.250
 frankly who has the worst tastes 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:03.210
 musical in the group according to you then 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:06.280
 what is it depends what we like me 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:08.070
 I'm pretty 80's so that's it 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:09.819
 not necessarily to everyone 

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:11.379
 after 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:13.959
 I do not know if we can talk about worse 

00:02:11.379 --> 00:02:15.129
 musical tastes but here we are I 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:19.049
 think we do not like all the same 

00:02:15.129 --> 00:02:20.980
 things so tastes vary here are 

00:02:19.049 --> 00:02:24.010
 she kills when you go home 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:25.810
 you after a match after a match that 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:27.790
 depends if we win or it depends if we 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:31.629
 win one loses bad perch furrow 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:32.950
 mood but I like to find here 

00:02:31.629 --> 00:02:35.859
 my family my friends 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:37.780
 after a game monfils spent time 

00:02:35.859 --> 00:02:41.370
 with can you sing us one of 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:41.370
 many songs emblematic of the green 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:47.980
 the low song which is the strongest 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:50.079
 obviously it's the green ones good I'm going 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:54.010
 not sing it but I like it when 

00:02:50.079 --> 00:02:56.139
 its grounds the fairways quite nice and 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:58.379
 webone good music so so I like 

00:02:56.139 --> 00:02:58.379
 pretty good 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:06.219
 are you going to make a beautiful cut at 

00:03:01.389 --> 00:03:08.340
 the obame or sakho not because I 

00:03:06.219 --> 00:03:10.840
 when I was young I had 80 and the 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:13.540
 here are the cuts a little weird 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:18.030
 and now with age we did it 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:18.030
 gesture to young people to do that 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:22.900
 like the ex green and jean pierre 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:24.400
 francois you have two names are you from 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:24.780
 put to the song do a clip on the 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:28.449
 beach 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:31.299
 no I do not think so but in any case I 

00:03:28.449 --> 00:03:32.859
 will be well liked knowing dark so that 

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:34.629
 Nice I find two here if we arrive 

00:03:32.859 --> 00:03:39.329
 to make a room and a footballer 

00:03:34.629 --> 00:03:39.329
 to make a song I think it's good 

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:43.720
 what is your surely in the team 

00:03:42.009 --> 00:03:46.150
 so my nickname of the team got started 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:49.239
 mold I know you ask me not where 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:50.799
 he comes I do not know he's a player 

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:53.139
 it's christophe jallet when he was at 

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:54.729
 Paris who called me like that so here we go 

00:03:53.139 --> 00:03:59.109
 now there are several who 

00:03:54.729 --> 00:04:00.579
 call me mimoun last question what 

00:03:59.109 --> 00:04:04.120
 is your favorite music style down 

00:04:00.579 --> 00:04:06.280
 as I say I'm pretty 80s 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:08.010
 French varieties so here is but 

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:10.239
 I do not like it that's all 

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:12.450
 especially the variety 

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:12.450
 French
