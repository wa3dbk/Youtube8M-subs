the make one make one is an increase
that<00:00:13.090> is<00:00:13.240> worked<00:00:14.250> into<00:00:15.250> the<00:00:15.369> horizontal<00:00:16.209> bar

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:16.420 
that is worked into the horizontal bar

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:19.230 
that is worked into the horizontal bar
between<00:00:16.660> two<00:00:17.080> stitches<00:00:17.400> so<00:00:18.400> let's<00:00:18.939> say<00:00:19.119> over

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:19.240 
between two stitches so let's say over

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:21.659 
between two stitches so let's say over
here<00:00:19.359> we<00:00:19.689> have<00:00:19.990> these<00:00:20.619> two<00:00:20.680> stitches<00:00:21.249> right

00:00:21.659 --> 00:00:21.669 
here we have these two stitches right

00:00:21.669 --> 00:00:24.480 
here we have these two stitches right
here<00:00:21.939> we're<00:00:22.089> gonna<00:00:22.240> work<00:00:22.740> the<00:00:23.740> increase<00:00:24.009> in

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:24.490 
here we're gonna work the increase in

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:27.989 
here we're gonna work the increase in
between<00:00:24.970> those<00:00:25.179> two<00:00:25.949> there<00:00:26.949> are<00:00:27.070> two<00:00:27.369> types<00:00:27.759> of

00:00:27.989 --> 00:00:27.999 
between those two there are two types of

00:00:27.999 --> 00:00:30.540 
between those two there are two types of
make<00:00:28.300> ones<00:00:28.659> there's<00:00:29.380> that<00:00:29.589> make<00:00:29.829> one<00:00:30.159> towards

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:30.550 
make ones there's that make one towards

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:32.670 
make ones there's that make one towards
the<00:00:30.669> left<00:00:30.909> and<00:00:31.239> there's<00:00:31.630> a<00:00:31.749> make<00:00:31.960> one<00:00:32.259> towards

the left and there's a make one towards

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:37.430 
the left and there's a make one towards
the<00:00:32.829> right<00:00:33.180> the<00:00:34.180> left<00:00:34.510> one<00:00:34.960> twist<00:00:36.210> clockwise

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
the right the left one twist clockwise

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.240 
the right the left one twist clockwise
and<00:00:38.440> the<00:00:39.430> right<00:00:39.879> one<00:00:40.210> you're<00:00:40.780> gonna<00:00:40.930> turn<00:00:41.289> this

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:42.250 
and the right one you're gonna turn this

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:45.180 
and the right one you're gonna turn this
strand<00:00:42.690> counterclockwise<00:00:43.690> let's<00:00:44.260> show<00:00:45.129> you

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:45.190 
strand counterclockwise let's show you

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:48.209 
strand counterclockwise let's show you
how<00:00:45.309> to<00:00:45.550> do<00:00:45.760> this<00:00:45.940> make<00:00:46.809> one<00:00:47.289> left

00:00:48.209 --> 00:00:48.219 
how to do this make one left

00:00:54.599 --> 00:00:54.609 
as you need them move them over one

00:00:54.609 --> 00:01:01.020 
as you need them move them over one
space<00:00:55.530> the<00:00:56.530> next<00:00:56.829> one<00:00:58.410> move<00:00:59.410> it<00:00:59.530> over<00:00:59.879> and<00:01:00.879> over

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:02.680 
now I am going to demonstrate that make

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:05.850 
now I am going to demonstrate that make
one<00:02:03.159> towards<00:02:03.729> the<00:02:03.880> right<00:02:04.119> in<00:02:04.450> this<00:02:05.140> instance

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:05.860 
one towards the right in this instance

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:09.870 
one towards the right in this instance
we<00:02:06.729> are<00:02:06.880> going<00:02:07.299> to<00:02:07.479> turn<00:02:07.840> the<00:02:08.649> horizontal<00:02:09.580> yarn

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:09.880 
we are going to turn the horizontal yarn

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:12.110 
we are going to turn the horizontal yarn
coming<00:02:10.209> from<00:02:10.450> between<00:02:10.780> the<00:02:10.989> two<00:02:11.170> pegs

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
coming from between the two pegs

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:15.150 
coming from between the two pegs
counterclockwise<00:02:13.120> so<00:02:14.110> let's<00:02:14.349> go<00:02:14.590> ahead<00:02:14.709> and

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:15.160 
counterclockwise so let's go ahead and

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:17.940 
counterclockwise so let's go ahead and
knit<00:02:15.989> towards<00:02:16.989> the<00:02:17.110> point<00:02:17.380> where<00:02:17.530> we<00:02:17.650> want<00:02:17.860> to

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 
knit towards the point where we want to

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:21.030 
knit towards the point where we want to
increase<00:02:18.430> at<00:02:18.730> this<00:02:19.000> in<00:02:19.870> my<00:02:20.110> example<00:02:20.709> I'm<00:02:20.830> gonna

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 
increase at this in my example I'm gonna

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:22.890 
increase at this in my example I'm gonna
knit<00:02:21.340> the<00:02:21.519> first<00:02:21.730> two<00:02:21.970> stitches<00:02:22.000> and<00:02:22.480> then<00:02:22.780> I'm

knit the first two stitches and then I'm
going<00:02:23.110> to<00:02:23.200> create<00:02:23.410> the<00:02:23.709> increase<00:02:24.540> so<00:02:25.540> there's

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780 
going to create the increase so there's

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:30.630 
going to create the increase so there's
the<00:02:25.959> two<00:02:26.230> I<00:02:26.940> open<00:02:27.940> the<00:02:28.060> empty<00:02:28.360> peg<00:02:29.010> now<00:02:30.010> I<00:02:30.370> am
