00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
these gorgeous old boards that are just

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.380 
these gorgeous old boards that are just
standing<00:02:09.899> up<00:02:10.080> nice<00:02:11.009> and<00:02:11.069> big<00:02:11.520> and<00:02:11.670> wide<00:02:11.879> I

standing up nice and big and wide I

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:13.850 
standing up nice and big and wide I
don't<00:02:12.810> have<00:02:12.930> tape<00:02:13.140> measure<00:02:13.349> on<00:02:13.560> me<00:02:13.680> but

that's my hand spread once and twice

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:18.880 
that's my hand spread once and twice
there<00:02:16.860> on<00:02:17.040> those<00:02:17.220> boards<00:02:17.460> so<00:02:17.790> that's<00:02:17.970> a<00:02:18.210> good<00:02:18.450> I

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:18.890 
there on those boards so that's a good I

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:21.290 
there on those boards so that's a good I
don't<00:02:19.890> know<00:02:19.950> if<00:02:20.040> 12<00:02:20.280> inches<00:02:20.550> anyway<00:02:20.970> maybe<00:02:21.180> a

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 
don't know if 12 inches anyway maybe a

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:23.840 
don't know if 12 inches anyway maybe a
little<00:02:21.390> bit<00:02:21.540> more<00:02:21.780> so<00:02:22.520> anyway<00:02:23.520> just<00:02:23.610> thought

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:23.850 
little bit more so anyway just thought

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:25.730 
little bit more so anyway just thought
I'd<00:02:23.940> share<00:02:24.180> my<00:02:24.390> progress<00:02:24.630> has<00:02:25.140> to<00:02:25.320> where<00:02:25.470> I<00:02:25.500> am

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:25.740 
I'd share my progress has to where I am

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:27.020 
I'd share my progress has to where I am
right<00:02:25.770> at<00:02:26.040> the<00:02:26.130> moment<00:02:26.460> what<00:02:26.640> I'm<00:02:26.700> going<00:02:26.850> to<00:02:26.880> be

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
right at the moment what I'm going to be

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:29.930 
right at the moment what I'm going to be
doing<00:02:27.180> is<00:02:28.130> putting<00:02:29.130> a<00:02:29.190> little<00:02:29.370> extension<00:02:29.700> on

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
doing is putting a little extension on

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:31.370 
doing is putting a little extension on
these<00:02:30.090> rafters<00:02:30.480> I'd<00:02:30.900> like<00:02:31.050> to<00:02:31.140> get<00:02:31.200> about

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
these rafters I'd like to get about

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:33.140 
these rafters I'd like to get about
eight<00:02:31.560> inches<00:02:31.830> of<00:02:31.950> insulation<00:02:32.070> in<00:02:32.640> here<00:02:32.670> right

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
eight inches of insulation in here right

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.510 
eight inches of insulation in here right
now<00:02:33.180> and<00:02:33.600> I<00:02:33.660> think<00:02:33.840> I<00:02:33.900> could<00:02:33.960> get<00:02:34.200> six<00:02:34.560> so<00:02:35.430> I'm

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:35.520 
now and I think I could get six so I'm

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:37.370 
now and I think I could get six so I'm
going<00:02:35.730> to<00:02:35.790> probably<00:02:36.030> just<00:02:36.360> run<00:02:36.570> a<00:02:36.600> two<00:02:37.020> before

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
going to probably just run a two before

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:40.610 
going to probably just run a two before
it<00:02:37.410> right<00:02:37.650> along<00:02:37.920> this<00:02:38.990> put<00:02:39.990> eight<00:02:40.230> inches<00:02:40.560> of

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
it right along this put eight inches of

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:43.130 
it right along this put eight inches of
insulation<00:02:40.770> up<00:02:41.400> there<00:02:41.690> put<00:02:42.690> some<00:02:42.870> kind<00:02:43.020> of

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
insulation up there put some kind of

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:46.310 
insulation up there put some kind of
little<00:02:43.950> air<00:02:44.160> passageway<00:02:45.030> thing<00:02:45.720> in<00:02:45.930> it<00:02:46.080> and

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:46.320 
little air passageway thing in it and

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:49.220 
little air passageway thing in it and
then<00:02:46.890> throw<00:02:47.250> some<00:02:47.280> some<00:02:48.180> sheetrock<00:02:48.660> on<00:02:48.810> top<00:02:49.080> of

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
then throw some some sheetrock on top of

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:51.440 
then throw some some sheetrock on top of
that<00:02:49.400> up<00:02:50.400> here<00:02:50.700> I'm<00:02:50.850> have<00:02:51.030> to<00:02:51.090> do<00:02:51.270> some

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
that up here I'm have to do some

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:53.000 
that up here I'm have to do some
remanufacturing<00:02:52.260> I<00:02:52.380> haven't<00:02:52.680> worked<00:02:52.800> the

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
remanufacturing I haven't worked the

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:54.470 
remanufacturing I haven't worked the
other<00:02:53.190> side<00:02:53.489> and<00:02:53.760> you<00:02:53.820> can<00:02:53.970> see<00:02:54.150> the<00:02:54.300> other

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
other side and you can see the other

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.990 
other side and you can see the other
side<00:02:54.570> still<00:02:55.110> has<00:02:55.260> an<00:02:55.410> old<00:02:55.560> fiber<00:02:55.800> board<00:02:56.160> more

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
side still has an old fiber board more

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.430 
side still has an old fiber board more
than<00:02:57.209> likely<00:02:57.390> when<00:02:57.600> I<00:02:57.690> pull<00:02:57.900> that<00:02:57.930> down<00:02:58.260> that's

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440 
than likely when I pull that down that's

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:00.290 
than likely when I pull that down that's
all<00:02:58.620> going<00:02:58.770> to<00:02:58.860> fall<00:02:58.980> down<00:02:59.190> on<00:02:59.250> the<00:02:59.459> head<00:02:59.670> too

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:00.300 
all going to fall down on the head too

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:03.020 
all going to fall down on the head too
I<00:03:00.500> had<00:03:01.500> some<00:03:01.680> interesting<00:03:01.830> wiring<00:03:02.670> going<00:03:02.910> on

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
I had some interesting wiring going on

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:04.370 
I had some interesting wiring going on
up<00:03:03.209> here<00:03:03.360> this<00:03:03.510> morning<00:03:03.840> I<00:03:03.900> spent<00:03:04.170> a<00:03:04.260> little

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:04.380 
up here this morning I spent a little

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:05.690 
up here this morning I spent a little
bit<00:03:04.560> of<00:03:04.680> time<00:03:04.830> getting<00:03:05.100> that<00:03:05.250> straightened

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 
bit of time getting that straightened

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:08.390 
bit of time getting that straightened
out<00:03:05.790> and<00:03:06.230> yeah<00:03:07.230> it<00:03:07.440> does<00:03:07.620> look<00:03:07.650> like<00:03:07.860> this<00:03:08.250> is

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
out and yeah it does look like this is

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:11.720 
out and yeah it does look like this is
all<00:03:08.610> full<00:03:08.880> of<00:03:09.709> pulling<00:03:10.709> more<00:03:10.950> cotton<00:03:11.190> more<00:03:11.640> of

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
all full of pulling more cotton more of

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:13.520 
all full of pulling more cotton more of
this<00:03:11.850> cotton<00:03:12.239> mold<00:03:12.390> insulation<00:03:13.050> right<00:03:13.200> on<00:03:13.320> top

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530 
this cotton mold insulation right on top

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:15.290 
this cotton mold insulation right on top
of<00:03:13.650> that<00:03:13.709> fiber<00:03:14.040> board<00:03:14.400> so<00:03:14.640> that<00:03:14.670> once<00:03:14.940> I<00:03:15.090> pull

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:15.300 
of that fiber board so that once I pull

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:18.680 
of that fiber board so that once I pull
that<00:03:15.330> down<00:03:16.250> I'll<00:03:17.250> have<00:03:17.280> a<00:03:17.459> nice<00:03:17.670> mess<00:03:18.000> but<00:03:18.570> what

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690 
that down I'll have a nice mess but what

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:21.470 
that down I'll have a nice mess but what
I<00:03:18.720> can<00:03:18.930> do<00:03:19.049> with<00:03:19.170> it<00:03:19.640> with<00:03:20.640> that<00:03:20.670> stuff<00:03:21.090> is<00:03:21.299> just

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:21.480 
I can do with it with that stuff is just

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:23.660 
I can do with it with that stuff is just
take<00:03:21.690> it<00:03:21.840> and<00:03:21.930> put<00:03:21.989> it<00:03:22.110> back<00:03:22.320> up<00:03:22.590> in<00:03:22.769> here<00:03:22.799> it's

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:23.670 
take it and put it back up in here it's

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:26.630 
take it and put it back up in here it's
good<00:03:23.940> insulation<00:03:24.420> and<00:03:24.810> it's<00:03:25.140> usable<00:03:25.650> and<00:03:25.860> this

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:26.640 
good insulation and it's usable and this

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:28.400 
good insulation and it's usable and this
insulation<00:03:27.209> up<00:03:27.330> here<00:03:27.510> in<00:03:27.600> places<00:03:27.989> is<00:03:28.110> kind<00:03:28.320> of

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:28.410 
insulation up here in places is kind of

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:30.680 
insulation up here in places is kind of
sunk<00:03:28.620> down<00:03:28.860> so<00:03:29.220> what<00:03:30.030> I'll<00:03:30.150> do<00:03:30.269> is<00:03:30.299> I'll<00:03:30.540> just

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:30.690 
sunk down so what I'll do is I'll just

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:32.270 
sunk down so what I'll do is I'll just
take<00:03:30.870> all<00:03:31.019> that<00:03:31.170> old<00:03:31.320> stuff<00:03:31.350> sweep<00:03:31.860> it<00:03:32.010> up<00:03:32.130> put

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:05.160 
rotting out is the fresh air moving to

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:07.520 
rotting out is the fresh air moving to
most<00:04:05.370> of<00:04:05.489> them<00:04:05.580> so<00:04:06.120> I<00:04:06.360> get<00:04:06.959> that's<00:04:07.110> enough<00:04:07.380> of
