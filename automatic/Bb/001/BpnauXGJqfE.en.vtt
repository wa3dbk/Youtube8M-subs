00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
is that I've made this decision and I

is that I've made this decision and I
would<00:01:54.570> have<00:01:54.689> to<00:01:54.780> go<00:01:54.899> through<00:01:54.930> such<00:01:55.380> a<00:01:55.409> huge

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
would have to go through such a huge

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.330 
would have to go through such a huge
drastic<00:01:56.780> procedure<00:01:57.780> to<00:01:58.140> get<00:01:58.289> them<00:01:58.500> you<00:01:59.310> know

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:08.130 
cool and all but at the end of the day I

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:10.520
