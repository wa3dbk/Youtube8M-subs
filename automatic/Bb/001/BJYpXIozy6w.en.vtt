00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
so you know in modern warfare 3 so far

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.709 
so you know in modern warfare 3 so far
all<00:00:40.230> the<00:00:40.410> maps<00:00:40.620> we<00:00:40.800> have<00:00:40.980> are<00:00:41.190> more<00:00:42.000> urban<00:00:42.510> you

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
all the maps we have are more urban you

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.030 
all the maps we have are more urban you
know<00:00:42.809> they're<00:00:43.079> kind<00:00:43.290> of<00:00:43.350> close<00:00:43.559> quarters

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
know they're kind of close quarters

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.889 
know they're kind of close quarters
there's<00:00:44.280> not<00:00:44.430> too<00:00:44.700> many<00:00:44.910> you<00:00:45.180> know<00:00:45.300> big<00:00:45.510> open

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
there's not too many you know big open

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.200 
there's not too many you know big open
areas<00:00:46.350> which<00:00:46.829> is<00:00:47.070> which<00:00:47.489> is<00:00:47.520> why<00:00:47.670> I<00:00:47.789> think<00:00:48.090> a

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
areas which is which is why I think a

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.180 
areas which is which is why I think a
wasteland<00:00:48.719> ish<00:00:48.989> type<00:00:49.289> map<00:00:49.559> would<00:00:49.739> be<00:00:49.860> kind<00:00:50.100> of

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
wasteland ish type map would be kind of

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:51.920 
wasteland ish type map would be kind of
cool<00:00:50.250> to<00:00:50.430> add<00:00:50.730> to<00:00:50.940> the<00:00:51.030> game<00:00:51.210> just<00:00:51.719> because

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
cool to add to the game just because

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.630 
cool to add to the game just because
it's<00:00:52.079> going<00:00:52.170> to<00:00:52.230> mix<00:00:52.649> it<00:00:52.800> up<00:00:52.890> a<00:00:53.039> little<00:00:53.070> bit<00:00:53.280> so

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
it's going to mix it up a little bit so

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.400 
it's going to mix it up a little bit so
you<00:00:54.149> know<00:00:54.239> you<00:00:54.449> can't<00:00:54.719> really<00:00:54.840> tell<00:00:55.079> how<00:00:55.199> big

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
don't really see why they should still

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.030 
don't really see why they should still
have<00:01:48.720> to<00:01:48.899> wait<00:01:49.049> a<00:01:49.079> month<00:01:49.439> you<00:01:49.740> know<00:01:49.829> that's

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
have to wait a month you know that's

never seen before okay so think about

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:44.310 
never seen before okay so think about
this<00:02:42.580> if<00:02:42.880> they're<00:02:43.270> not<00:02:43.390> doing<00:02:43.660> maps<00:02:44.020> and

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:44.320 
this if they're not doing maps and

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:46.350 
this if they're not doing maps and
they're<00:02:44.650> not<00:02:44.770> doing<00:02:44.920> spec<00:02:45.250> ops<00:02:45.430> missions<00:02:45.850> what

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:46.360 
they're not doing spec ops missions what

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:48.000 
they're not doing spec ops missions what
else<00:02:46.510> could<00:02:46.780> they<00:02:46.930> add<00:02:47.080> to<00:02:47.320> the<00:02:47.440> game<00:02:47.650> and<00:02:47.860> a

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.010 
else could they add to the game and a

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:50.310 
else could they add to the game and a
DLC<00:02:48.490> pack<00:02:48.730> well<00:02:49.270> they<00:02:49.630> can't<00:02:49.870> really<00:02:50.110> mess

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:50.320 
DLC pack well they can't really mess

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:51.990 
DLC pack well they can't really mess
with<00:02:50.350> the<00:02:50.590> campaign<00:02:51.070> just<00:02:51.280> because<00:02:51.610> campaign

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.000 
with the campaign just because campaign

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.670 
with the campaign just because campaign
is<00:02:52.120> campaign<00:02:52.510> it's<00:02:52.690> hard<00:02:52.870> to<00:02:52.990> add<00:02:53.140> anything<00:02:53.500> to

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:53.680 
is campaign it's hard to add anything to

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:55.860 
is campaign it's hard to add anything to
that<00:02:53.830> last<00:02:54.190> minute<00:02:54.580> I<00:02:54.730> think<00:02:55.480> the<00:02:55.570> only<00:02:55.600> thing

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:55.870 
that last minute I think the only thing

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:58.020 
that last minute I think the only thing
that<00:02:56.170> can<00:02:56.290> change<00:02:56.530> is<00:02:56.740> multiplayer<00:02:57.250> what<00:02:57.880> can

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.030 
that can change is multiplayer what can

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:59.580 
that can change is multiplayer what can
they<00:02:58.150> change<00:02:58.330> with<00:02:58.450> in<00:02:58.690> multiplayer<00:02:59.110> well

00:02:59.580 --> 00:02:59.590 
they change with in multiplayer well

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:01.170 
they change with in multiplayer well
they<00:02:59.680> could<00:02:59.830> add<00:02:59.950> guns<00:03:00.280> they<00:03:00.580> can<00:03:00.730> add<00:03:00.820> perks

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:01.180 
they could add guns they can add perks

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:02.670 
they could add guns they can add perks
they<00:03:01.420> could<00:03:01.570> add<00:03:01.660> equipment<00:03:02.140> they<00:03:02.440> could<00:03:02.590> add

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:02.680 
they could add equipment they could add

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:04.800 
they could add equipment they could add
kill<00:03:03.010> streaks<00:03:03.400> they<00:03:03.760> can<00:03:03.910> do<00:03:04.000> all<00:03:04.209> kinds<00:03:04.240> of

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:04.810 
kill streaks they can do all kinds of

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:06.840 
kill streaks they can do all kinds of
stuff<00:03:05.050> like<00:03:05.170> that<00:03:05.320> and<00:03:05.650> I<00:03:06.310> honestly<00:03:06.459> think

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:06.850 
stuff like that and I honestly think

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:08.490 
stuff like that and I honestly think
that<00:03:06.970> if<00:03:07.150> they<00:03:07.270> like<00:03:07.480> added<00:03:07.810> another<00:03:08.050> gun<00:03:08.350> to

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:08.500 
that if they like added another gun to

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:10.140 
that if they like added another gun to
each<00:03:08.650> tier<00:03:09.010> maybe<00:03:09.280> added<00:03:09.580> a<00:03:09.670> couple<00:03:09.820> kill

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:10.150 
each tier maybe added a couple kill

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:12.030 
each tier maybe added a couple kill
streaks<00:03:10.510> and<00:03:10.660> then<00:03:11.080> supplemented<00:03:11.590> that<00:03:11.860> with

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:12.040 
streaks and then supplemented that with

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:14.009 
streaks and then supplemented that with
new<00:03:12.220> maps<00:03:12.459> and<00:03:12.700> new<00:03:12.760> spec<00:03:13.000> ops<00:03:13.180> missions<00:03:13.570> that

00:03:14.009 --> 00:03:14.019 
new maps and new spec ops missions that

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:15.780 
new maps and new spec ops missions that
could<00:03:14.230> really<00:03:14.440> regenerate<00:03:15.100> the<00:03:15.250> game<00:03:15.489> when<00:03:15.670> it

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:15.790 
could really regenerate the game when it

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:17.670 
could really regenerate the game when it
starts<00:03:16.120> to<00:03:16.180> get<00:03:16.300> old<00:03:16.420> you<00:03:16.600> know<00:03:16.630> five<00:03:17.260> or<00:03:17.290> six

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:34.390 
don't know if they're actually doing

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:36.300 
don't know if they're actually doing
that<00:03:34.630> and<00:03:34.780> just<00:03:34.959> kind<00:03:35.170> of<00:03:35.200> inferring<00:03:35.769> it<00:03:35.890> but

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:36.310 
that and just kind of inferring it but

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:38.640 
that and just kind of inferring it but
there's<00:03:36.730> not<00:03:36.880> much<00:03:37.090> else<00:03:37.299> they<00:03:37.540> could<00:03:37.600> do<00:03:37.959> if

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:38.650 
there's not much else they could do if

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:40.680 
there's not much else they could do if
they're<00:03:38.860> doing<00:03:39.130> maps<00:03:39.400> spec<00:03:39.820> ops<00:03:40.030> missions<00:03:40.450> and
