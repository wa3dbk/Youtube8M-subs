00:00:01.689 --> 00:00:04.689
 Hello space is 

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:07.720
 On the seat 

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:10.720
 Message clause for joining a company 

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:12.450
 Manabu Inoue 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:14.499
 I want to go 

00:00:14.499 --> 00:00:16.400
 Well last time is it 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:18.400
 that 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.650
 I have lost Duskin 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:23.019
 I was really sorry 

00:00:23.019 --> 00:00:26.199
 Imari and I do not know the cause 

00:00:26.199 --> 00:00:28.849
 I want to do my best not to do that again 

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:31.859
 I think 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.440
 It is said that I have thought deeply 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.990
 this 

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:40.480
 Three times as a result of agreeing to this proposal 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:44.320
 It's in the shape of the leftmost passport calf 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:47.320
 Is it him? 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.130
 It is always written as back 27 

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:55.030
 This is the chief 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:58.700
 I did not know if the data was sold before 

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:00.530
 Also here 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:03.530
 I think it might be a map from outside the area 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:07.640
 This poster gets worse 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:10.640
 ... 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:22.520
 Aikawa Haru Festival in front of the Niimata, for the time being 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.440
 I can not blame 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:28.440
 How is Nakai going? 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:31.870
 Wine recall 

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:34.870
 It is after aha 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:38.920
 Interrupt 15 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:41.310
 That's why Seventy-one High 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.970
 It is heart to reach the illustration Peter's t-shirt 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.970
 Please look carefully while it is becoming 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:52.310
 By that 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:53.390
 There is a place of origin 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:54.860
 Because it is luxury 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:57.170
 ep no match 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:58.300
 here 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:59.730
 I talked to 7 

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:02.730
 I'm going to the beginning of February 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:06.830
 I will put it in the pass to be addressed in the future 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:10.079
 Something was written on the back of the oil painting lid 

00:02:10.079 --> 00:02:13.079
 It is not expensive to be second 

00:02:13.629 --> 00:02:17.109
 Play equal a + b + c and 

00:02:17.109 --> 00:02:19.489
 I do not know why 

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:22.489
 Here this piggy bank 

00:02:23.299 --> 00:02:26.389
 President Narita died at the bottom of the savings box 

00:02:26.389 --> 00:02:29.759
 Where is it written npc 

00:02:31.659 --> 00:02:33.389
 That's right 

00:02:33.389 --> 00:02:36.779
 As always I think he is the number to eat 

00:02:36.779 --> 00:02:38.109
 Because 

00:02:38.109 --> 00:02:40.479
 If everyone this video role 

00:02:40.479 --> 00:02:43.169
 I think that the alarm is different when doing the revised law 

00:02:43.169 --> 00:02:44.959
 It would have been 

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:47.409
 In addition these from the left 

00:02:47.409 --> 00:02:48.620
 Every morning 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:51.060
 Judgment committee members from unnecessary things 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:52.399
 5 days since I won 

00:02:52.399 --> 00:02:55.579
 You can get 8755. 

00:02:55.579 --> 00:02:58.289
 Then 

00:02:58.289 --> 00:03:01.789
 This is everyone's thanks. 

00:03:03.399 --> 00:03:06.269
 It was a fun bill 

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:07.819
 From outside the city 

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:10.780
 Kusano to 8. t 10 yen coin year 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:12.209
 Lively sale 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:13.519
 Up to twenty days 

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:16.260
 Because it is round shape of 5 yen coin and the students 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.159
 During that 

00:03:18.159 --> 00:03:20.720
 Good after that, its power is weak 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:22.309
 At 500 

00:03:22.309 --> 00:03:25.309
 A thousand yen bill or five thousand yen bill because it is a murder 

00:03:26.129 --> 00:03:26.980
 First 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:28.849
 Idemitsu idea 

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:32.149
 Because it seems that I was standing at that point 

00:03:32.149 --> 00:03:34.889
 First left 1 

00:03:34.889 --> 00:03:36.239
 Every day 

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:39.069
 In contravention of the British retail amount 

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:42.099
 With 15001 clicks 

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:45.099
 Let's do password 

00:03:46.969 --> 00:03:49.099
 The instructor is today's battle 

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:50.649
 Scatter the path 

00:03:50.649 --> 00:03:53.049
 It is rice Calper's 

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:56.049
 Because orange of scale comes in and does not matter 

00:03:56.589 --> 00:03:58.709
 Only the amount of multilayer wiring 

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:02.179
 It was a tendency to roll in Rick after being cut for a long time 

00:04:02.179 --> 00:04:05.179
 But orange is the key from inside 

00:04:08.619 --> 00:04:10.929
 It is said that the incident took place 

00:04:10.929 --> 00:04:13.089
 This is done 

00:04:13.089 --> 00:04:15.849
 I said this tank 

00:04:15.849 --> 00:04:19.150
 I got a posture after I got ready with Kato 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:28.240
 It seems to shake the bat and call it many 

00:04:28.849 --> 00:04:29.949
 If not 

00:04:29.949 --> 00:04:32.659
 I understand that Tapas has a status 

00:04:32.659 --> 00:04:33.939
 Up to 

00:04:33.939 --> 00:04:36.129
 I was there 

00:04:36.129 --> 00:04:37.360
 Alice 

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:40.720
 I said that I scattered the path to this most fun place 

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:43.099
 It is very kind 

00:04:43.099 --> 00:04:45.819
 It is written as 8 items 

00:04:45.819 --> 00:04:48.259
 It should be a number that spans this 

00:04:48.259 --> 00:04:49.430
 8 

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:52.430
 Tono 

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:57.749
 Got money management 

00:04:57.749 --> 00:05:00.710
 Diet heart to do with this 

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:02.960
 I did not check the richness 

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:05.960
 I have not been there since I used a hammer 

00:05:10.719 --> 00:05:13.719
 Test opinion withdrawal 

00:05:14.969 --> 00:05:17.960
 Dark room 

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:20.960
 Dark room 

00:05:21.789 --> 00:05:23.349
 Face 

00:05:23.349 --> 00:05:26.229
 I think it is usually cool that it was not only that 

00:05:26.229 --> 00:05:29.069
 here 

00:05:29.069 --> 00:05:31.800
 American Football 50:50 

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:34.499
 In fact 

00:05:34.499 --> 00:05:36.919
 Main battle 

00:05:36.919 --> 00:05:39.699
 I made a game and I didn't return 

00:05:39.699 --> 00:05:42.699
 I understood 

00:05:45.089 --> 00:05:46.930
 worry 

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:49.930
 I have seen it for two months 

00:05:52.809 --> 00:05:55.949
 According to the story I heard after the night army 

00:05:56.529 --> 00:05:59.919
 I do not seem to cause a motorcycle accident 

00:05:59.919 --> 00:06:02.919
 It seems to have wandered the border of life and death on the 3rd 

00:06:03.559 --> 00:06:07.169
 I told you that I could not leave that room 

00:06:10.689 --> 00:06:13.689
 The talk I experienced is more than this 

00:06:14.539 --> 00:06:17.539
 However, could you 

00:06:20.249 --> 00:06:23.249
 I want to be able to do anything 

00:06:23.809 --> 00:06:26.809
 As if it is two people 

00:06:27.919 --> 00:06:30.919
 As it is in the top 

00:06:32.219 --> 00:06:34.889
 Kobe 

00:06:34.889 --> 00:06:38.059
 There is still a merit that you can really play in Marri 

00:06:38.059 --> 00:06:41.409
 I think first 

00:06:41.409 --> 00:06:42.479
 Mano 

00:06:42.479 --> 00:06:44.110
 In the case of me 

00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:48.009
 Going from Mie Prefecture only 23 times and cooling Wakayama house myself 

00:06:48.009 --> 00:06:49.300
 I tried to 

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:52.820
 It's insanely fast that 500 million people get in and finish in 3 points 

00:06:52.819 --> 00:06:54.520
 Will be 

00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:57.809
 It was a live-action animation that you can put out such Michel 

00:06:58.509 --> 00:07:00.559
 However, people who have seen this far 

00:07:00.559 --> 00:07:02.240
 Thank you very much 

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:04.189
 et Robocon drama 

00:07:04.189 --> 00:07:07.290
 I'm glad to see it because I think something will happen 

00:07:07.290 --> 00:07:08.050
 Goodbye
