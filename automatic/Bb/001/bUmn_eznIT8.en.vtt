shaft<00:03:55.470> right<00:03:55.890> there<00:03:56.160> but<00:03:56.459> it's<00:03:56.640> really<00:03:56.790> cool

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.000 
shaft right there but it's really cool

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.190 
shaft right there but it's really cool
because<00:03:57.060> there's<00:03:57.360> a<00:03:57.420> hole<00:03:57.570> in<00:03:57.600> ground<00:03:57.810> and

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:58.200 
because there's a hole in ground and

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:01.370 
because there's a hole in ground and
this<00:03:58.350> mine<00:03:58.530> shaft<00:03:58.860> is<00:03:59.040> almost<00:03:59.750> at<00:04:00.750> ground

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:01.380 
this mine shaft is almost at ground

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:06.170 
this mine shaft is almost at ground
level<00:04:02.840> I<00:04:03.840> mean<00:04:04.350> it's<00:04:04.470> not<00:04:04.560> it's<00:04:04.739> only<00:04:04.860> about<00:04:05.180> 10

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:06.180 
level I mean it's not it's only about 10

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:08.660 
level I mean it's not it's only about 10
blocks<00:04:06.360> down<00:04:06.840> from<00:04:07.280> ground<00:04:08.280> level<00:04:08.370> that's

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:08.670 
blocks down from ground level that's

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:10.190 
blocks down from ground level that's
probably<00:04:09.209> the<00:04:09.299> first<00:04:09.510> mine<00:04:09.780> shaft<00:04:10.049> that<00:04:10.140> i

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:10.200 
probably the first mine shaft that i

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:12.319 
probably the first mine shaft that i
found<00:04:10.440> that<00:04:10.500> is<00:04:10.680> so<00:04:11.549> close<00:04:11.760> to<00:04:11.850> ground<00:04:12.120> level

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:12.329 
found that is so close to ground level

00:04:12.329 --> 00:04:14.390 
found that is so close to ground level
but<00:04:12.630> pretty<00:04:13.140> cool<00:04:13.350> little<00:04:13.680> mine<00:04:13.920> shaft<00:04:14.220> goes

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:14.400 
but pretty cool little mine shaft goes

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:16.340 
but pretty cool little mine shaft goes
in<00:04:14.579> a<00:04:14.640> lot<00:04:14.760> of<00:04:14.790> different<00:04:15.090> directions<00:04:15.450> haven't

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:16.350 
in a lot of different directions haven't

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:17.630 
in a lot of different directions haven't
ventured<00:04:16.470> too<00:04:16.799> much<00:04:16.979> in<00:04:17.130> it<00:04:17.250> I<00:04:17.340> know<00:04:17.400> there<00:04:17.609> are

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:17.640 
ventured too much in it I know there are

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:19.729 
ventured too much in it I know there are
a<00:04:17.760> few<00:04:17.970> chests<00:04:18.329> in<00:04:18.450> there<00:04:18.630> I<00:04:18.870> can't<00:04:19.560> remember

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:19.739 
a few chests in there I can't remember

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:23.060 
a few chests in there I can't remember
what<00:04:20.040> they<00:04:20.190> were<00:04:20.220> but<00:04:20.729> it's<00:04:21.510> over<00:04:21.720> here<00:04:22.140> ha

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:23.070 
what they were but it's over here ha

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:27.110 
what they were but it's over here ha
dead<00:04:23.610> end<00:04:23.930> but<00:04:24.930> really<00:04:25.349> cool<00:04:25.590> i<00:04:25.940> like<00:04:26.940> how

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:27.120 
dead end but really cool i like how

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:28.050 
dead end but really cool i like how
they're<00:04:27.479> just<00:04:27.599> a<00:04:27.660> big

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:28.060 
they're just a big

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:29.760 
they're just a big
and<00:04:28.300> it<00:04:28.419> shows<00:04:28.690> you<00:04:28.900> where<00:04:29.050> the<00:04:29.139> mine<00:04:29.290> shaft<00:04:29.560> is

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:29.770 
and it shows you where the mine shaft is

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:32.129 
and it shows you where the mine shaft is
so<00:04:30.040> very<00:04:30.760> very<00:04:30.850> cool<00:04:31.240> try<00:04:31.540> that<00:04:31.690> one<00:04:31.810> out<00:04:31.840> and

00:04:32.129 --> 00:04:32.139 
so very very cool try that one out and

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:34.890 
so very very cool try that one out and
for<00:04:32.710> the<00:04:32.800> last<00:04:32.980> seed<00:04:33.310> the<00:04:33.970> last<00:04:34.210> seed<00:04:34.510> of<00:04:34.750> the

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:34.900 
for the last seed the last seed of the

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:38.730 
for the last seed the last seed of the
day<00:04:35.050> is<00:04:35.350> hi<00:04:35.889> there<00:04:36.310> and<00:04:36.720> if<00:04:37.720> detected<00:04:38.080> in<00:04:38.200> you

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:38.740 
day is hi there and if detected in you

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:46.440 
day is hi there and if detected in you
get<00:04:39.750> this<00:04:40.750> very<00:04:40.870> very<00:04:41.440> tiny<00:04:42.540> jungle<00:04:43.540> I<00:04:45.450> don't

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:46.450 
get this very very tiny jungle I don't

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:47.700 
get this very very tiny jungle I don't
know<00:04:46.510> if<00:04:46.570> you<00:04:46.630> can<00:04:46.720> call<00:04:46.840> it<00:04:46.900> an<00:04:47.080> island<00:04:47.440> let<00:04:47.620> me

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:47.710 
know if you can call it an island let me

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:49.080 
know if you can call it an island let me
see<00:04:47.860> if<00:04:47.950> this<00:04:48.100> is<00:04:48.280> an<00:04:48.430> island<00:04:48.550> over<00:04:48.910> here

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:49.090 
see if this is an island over here

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:51.870 
see if this is an island over here
anyway<00:04:49.720> this<00:04:49.870> small<00:04:50.410> jungle<00:04:50.830> biome<00:04:51.550> this

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:51.880 
anyway this small jungle biome this

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:54.650 
anyway this small jungle biome this
thing's<00:04:52.150> tiny<00:04:52.450> so<00:04:53.020> basically<00:04:53.470> you've<00:04:53.620> got

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:54.660 
thing's tiny so basically you've got

00:04:54.660 --> 00:05:00.420 
thing's tiny so basically you've got
snow<00:04:55.660> sand<00:04:56.850> island<00:04:57.850> there<00:04:59.130> of<00:05:00.130> course<00:05:00.280> is

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:00.430 
snow sand island there of course is

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:03.210 
snow sand island there of course is
taking<00:05:00.729> forever<00:05:00.910> rendering<00:05:01.540> but<00:05:02.010> very<00:05:03.010> very

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:03.220 
taking forever rendering but very very

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:05.190 
taking forever rendering but very very
very<00:05:03.550> tiny<00:05:03.880> but<00:05:04.270> really<00:05:04.540> cool<00:05:04.690> place<00:05:04.900> to<00:05:04.930> start

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:05.200 
very tiny but really cool place to start

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:06.450 
very tiny but really cool place to start
because<00:05:05.290> you<00:05:05.500> got<00:05:05.620> wood<00:05:05.800> right<00:05:05.950> away<00:05:06.190> you<00:05:06.250> can

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:06.460 
because you got wood right away you can

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:09.840 
because you got wood right away you can
start<00:05:06.840> hacking<00:05:07.840> away<00:05:08.020> at<00:05:08.169> this<00:05:08.560> and<00:05:08.889> move<00:05:09.610> on

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:09.850 
start hacking away at this and move on

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:14.000 
start hacking away at this and move on
but<00:05:10.270> very<00:05:10.900> tiny<00:05:11.320> jungle<00:05:11.919> jungle<00:05:12.910> biome<00:05:13.300> and

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:14.010 
but very tiny jungle jungle biome and

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:17.580 
but very tiny jungle jungle biome and
let<00:05:15.010> me<00:05:15.100> go<00:05:15.220> up<00:05:15.340> a<00:05:15.400> little<00:05:15.490> bit<00:05:15.700> more<00:05:16.590> anyway

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:17.590 
let me go up a little bit more anyway

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:20.040 
let me go up a little bit more anyway
hopefully<00:05:18.280> they<00:05:18.520> do<00:05:18.660> they're<00:05:19.660> going<00:05:19.780> to<00:05:19.840> be

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:20.050 
hopefully they do they're going to be

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:21.480 
hopefully they do they're going to be
fixing<00:05:20.200> these<00:05:20.440> because<00:05:20.830> these<00:05:21.010> biomes<00:05:21.430> are

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:21.490 
fixing these because these biomes are

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:22.620 
fixing these because these biomes are
way<00:05:21.669> too<00:05:21.729> small<00:05:22.090> humming<00:05:22.389> look<00:05:22.450> at<00:05:22.570> these

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:22.630 
way too small humming look at these

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:23.940 
way too small humming look at these
there's<00:05:22.900> three<00:05:23.169> of<00:05:23.200> them<00:05:23.290> right<00:05:23.470> here<00:05:23.530> within

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:23.950 
there's three of them right here within

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:26.460 
there's three of them right here within
a<00:05:24.100> matter<00:05:24.400> of<00:05:24.520> I<00:05:25.060> don't<00:05:25.479> know<00:05:25.630> 20<00:05:25.780> blocks<00:05:26.110> oh

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:26.470 
a matter of I don't know 20 blocks oh

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:28.170 
a matter of I don't know 20 blocks oh
but<00:05:27.280> anyway<00:05:27.520> that<00:05:27.550> I<00:05:27.700> thought<00:05:27.850> that<00:05:27.910> was<00:05:28.000> still

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:28.180 
but anyway that I thought that was still
