00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.700
 Hello everyone on the air Evridayydro and 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:09.630
 Today we have a review of the sketchbook for 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:11.340
 November this month I painted here in 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:14.309
 such a notebook from beeches 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:16.320
 forced to admit that he let the world down 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:18.960
 because for the month of use he 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.660
 the whole is already falling apart unstuck and 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.939
 his paper is not very thick all my 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.189
 materials almost see through since 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:28.830
 it was a gift and it has a convenient format 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.929
 I continue to use the first turn 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.149
 This is not a successful drawing. I tried. 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:35.370
 draw only mascara without using 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:37.050
 contours and absolutely zaylilas in this 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.239
 plan because my initial 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.700
 idea failed first 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:44.340
 Of course, due to the fact that I have not studied 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.230
 well enough similar patterns as in 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.420
 second because the paper is in this 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.719
 the sketchbook is pretty loose she absorbed 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:54.030
 mascara sloppy stains so 

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:56.760
 flipping through the next turns i 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:59.190
 drew a tool like that 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.910
 I have already shown in the tool overview 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.840
 for mascara 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:05.610
 This so-called php more about him I 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.650
 I will tell you when I will 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.930
 show me how I paint with ink and here I am 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.760
 just bought this tool and in general 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.110
 tested how it works like this 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.500
 This is why the first sketches 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:18.600
 looks pretty scary curves in 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.880
 Mostly this outline we here nature 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.040
 without the original pencil sketch 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.140
 Of course they look crooked but not so 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.119
 less if you only use mascara 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.159
 you can not wash the eye 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:32.720
 pumped faster to indicate 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:36.210
 I used the shadows like this 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:39.119
 marker from stabilo next turn 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:41.250
 And this, again, drawings with a brush, here I am 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:43.409
 have not figured out how he works already 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:46.140
 filed rather weakly therefore drawings 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:48.689
 such a dry brush all that I made from 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.369
 This technique is something that dry brush me 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:52.619
 don't like maybe someday 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:54.180
 when i learn to use it i will 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:56.760
 draw her something but me more 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:59.100
 like when the shower line is the same 

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:01.100
 i'm fat or thin but when she has 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.270
 such a rich black color 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:05.400
 the next turn is all these too 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:13.770
 sketches from nature that I painted 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:15.720
 on this page at all 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:18.570
 indulged my friends so don't pay 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:20.880
 attention to give your picture 

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:23.310
 I used some color accent 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:26.310
 their thick colored pencils acts 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:28.320
 quinhar effect that comes from 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:30.030
 smears shaded by pencil on 

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:32.760
 I really liked the carcass so I will 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:34.350
 use it more often then here i am 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:37.170
 finally understood how all the same 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:39.720
 squeeze the mascara out of it and she 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:41.280
 flowed such a saturated stream and I 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:44.130
 began to test and and but apparently 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:46.530
 the paper in this sketchbook is very thin and 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:50.580
 everything shines through and the other side even 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:54.150
 The usual marker can be seen 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:55.890
 how I painted a sleeping cat and just 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:57.840
 trained to draw all sorts of different 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:00.360
 ornaments because it seems to me that 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:02.840
 carcasses you and contour are very predispose to 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:05.520
 drawing some geometric things 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:07.950
 I tried to make sketches of living nature 

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:09.989
 and mostly still sketched my 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:12.209
 friends while they ate i focused 5 

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:15.930
 on some single detail on the face or on 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:18.180
 hand just trying to catch some 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:20.400
 mood with the figure and the further the 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:22.739
 I understood more how the windshield works 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:24.570
 nevertheless it is still difficult for 

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:26.519
 me tool but he's cool because 

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:28.769
 that he makes a very big contrast 

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:30.900
 between the thin and thick line this 

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:33.690
 expressive tool me right very much 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:35.280
 like again sketched their 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:37.280
 friends when they were all going to 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:40.019
 some meeting 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:41.880
 let them indulge it again too 

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:44.340
 page which I almost donâ€™t 

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:46.650
 drew and drew hands all this with 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:48.930
 natures and super fast to train 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:50.880
 eye gauge and train yourself to work 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:54.240
 material which does not allow of about 

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:57.180
 fuck here again see how much 

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:59.430
 shines through this windshield just generally 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:02.400
 very thin page I don't know for sure 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:04.980
 this sketchbook is designed for a pencil or 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:06.960
 just doing a thin pen 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:09.660
 small sketches while watching a movie 

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:11.370
 specifically this korean is very strange 

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:13.680
 movie about the train that goes by 

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:15.840
 snowy terrain it is called sheaf 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:17.700
 Kircher if you like korean movies then 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:19.980
 I advise you to him there was very 

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:21.959
 beautiful korean girl and proper 

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:24.150
 while I watched this movie somehow here itself 

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:26.130
 I managed to draw this 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:28.710
 drawing here you can see how strong 

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:30.480
 the contrast between the thick touch here 

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:32.940
 for example on armor yes so in one stroke 

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:35.310
 drawn and between thin strokes 

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:37.110
 for example in the eyes or in the hair is given brash 

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:40.920
 varies the thickness of the stroke 

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:43.230
 then very cool again continued to do 

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:45.540
 sketches from nature I drew again 

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:47.580
 while watching a movie it seemed to me 

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:49.290
 then a pretty good occupation during 

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:50.520
 watching a boring movie which metro 

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:52.650
 will be right all the way 

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:54.960
 be in the plot this specifically 

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:55.920
 chinese cinema by japanese manga which 

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:57.780
 called shama 

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:59.730
 very strange on women again 

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:03.180
 she had a very character girl 

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:05.250
 unusual what appearance and so I decided 

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:07.470
 draw it again, you can see how much 

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:09.870
 the thickness of the stroke varies 

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:11.870
 here you can see how I used a pencil 

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:15.330
 I like the color as it fits 

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:17.070
 smooth texture mascara with uneven texture 

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:20.400
 the pencil is so awesome 

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:21.480
 the contrast by which you can play well 

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:23.580
 sketches from nature 

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:26.190
 I took the architectural sketch first 

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:28.560
 pencil very thin outlined the main 

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:31.050
 lines walked on top thrown trying 

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:32.020
 reflect the basic fact which 

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:34.150
 attended 

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:36.610
 for example a ruined broken brick or 

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:38.770
 stone grass and then me very 

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:42.250
 I wanted such a rich blue 

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:44.229
 tempera paint sky mask put 

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:46.750
 very heterogeneous to look 

00:05:44.229 --> 00:05:49.060
 more interesting as a tour seems to me black 

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:52.990
 mascara very well combined saturated 

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:55.330
 cool 75 and I already switched to some 

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:57.819
 small pencil sketches and visible 

00:05:55.330 --> 00:06:00.039
 that the pencil does not shine through 

00:05:57.819 --> 00:06:02.500
 even the tempera came through like 

00:06:00.039 --> 00:06:04.240
 the reverse side and became that figure 

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:05.919
 sketches for my new drawing 

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:08.830
 which I will later show in 

00:06:05.919 --> 00:06:10.990
 public and even then just such thoughtless 

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:13.720
 sketches from the head when i tried out 

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:15.669
 heads from memory to build villages decided 

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:17.770
 still don't rely only on your 

00:06:15.669 --> 00:06:20.199
 eye meter and when I came home checked 

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:21.909
 all these sketches again by model 

00:06:20.199 --> 00:06:26.050
 of course I had a lot of jambs there 

00:06:21.909 --> 00:06:28.120
 corrected them decided to return more to his 

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:30.340
 a classic sketch of people in the subway 

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:32.620
 and since it became cold in Prague I became 

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:34.719
 less then ride the subway, and this time in 

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:36.900
 I have done quite a day already 

00:06:34.719 --> 00:06:39.699
 colored pencil 

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:42.460
 Well, the last for this month sketches 

00:06:39.699 --> 00:06:45.969
 it is again for my drawing which will 

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:48.310
 later show the factory and this super 

00:06:45.969 --> 00:06:51.550
 quick sketch two minute or even 

00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:53.110
 minute from art battle about Arbat again in 

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:55.569
 this time will be a video I will tell in detail 

00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:57.610
 that it was me taking part again 

00:06:55.569 --> 00:06:59.889
 before starting regretted at the end i was 

00:06:57.610 --> 00:07:01.930
 ok but actually all my other 

00:06:59.889 --> 00:07:04.389
 drawings this month have focused on 

00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:05.199
 comp or it was sketches from nature for 

00:07:04.389 --> 00:07:08.340
 two minutes 

00:07:05.199 --> 00:07:11.080
 I will show them in a separate post 

00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:12.580
 thank you for your attention 

00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:15.699
 subscribe comment and post 

00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:16.870
 likes i will post a new video lag 

00:07:15.699 --> 00:07:22.680
 Colin Firth 

00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:22.680
 all good and to variable
