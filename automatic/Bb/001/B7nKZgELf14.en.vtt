00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:32.440 
gonna have to side with a lot of the

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:34.770 
gonna have to side with a lot of the
analysts<00:05:32.920> before<00:05:33.250> me<00:05:33.460> and<00:05:33.610> say<00:05:33.880> that<00:05:34.120> a<00:05:34.510> new

analysts before me and say that a new
ending<00:05:34.990> would<00:05:35.320> probably<00:05:35.830> really<00:05:36.070> embellish

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:37.060 
ending would probably really embellish

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:39.480 
ending would probably really embellish
this<00:05:37.210> episode<00:05:37.690> a<00:05:37.720> lot<00:05:37.990> however<00:05:38.980> I'm<00:05:39.130> not<00:05:39.280> going

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:39.490 
this episode a lot however I'm not going

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:41.040 
this episode a lot however I'm not going
to<00:05:39.550> say<00:05:39.730> that<00:05:39.760> I<00:05:39.970> don't<00:05:40.240> think<00:05:40.480> cranky<00:05:40.900> and

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:41.050 
to say that I don't think cranky and

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:42.690 
to say that I don't think cranky and
Pinkie<00:05:41.350> Pie<00:05:41.500> should<00:05:41.740> have<00:05:41.830> become<00:05:42.130> friends<00:05:42.520> I

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:42.700 
Pinkie Pie should have become friends I

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:44.460 
Pinkie Pie should have become friends I
think<00:05:43.270> it<00:05:43.390> would<00:05:43.480> have<00:05:43.600> been<00:05:43.720> really<00:05:43.930> good<00:05:44.230> for

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:44.470 
think it would have been really good for

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:46.620 
think it would have been really good for
them<00:05:44.650> to<00:05:44.770> become<00:05:45.040> friends<00:05:45.250> however<00:05:46.030> just<00:05:46.120> with

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:46.630 
them to become friends however just with

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:48.630 
them to become friends however just with
a<00:05:46.660> different<00:05:46.780> framing<00:05:47.410> I<00:05:47.560> think<00:05:48.190> that<00:05:48.340> moral

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:48.640 
a different framing I think that moral

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:50.010 
a different framing I think that moral
would<00:05:48.790> have<00:05:48.880> been<00:05:49.000> compromised<00:05:49.510> by<00:05:49.690> the<00:05:49.720> fact

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:50.020 
would have been compromised by the fact

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:51.360 
would have been compromised by the fact
that<00:05:50.140> pinky<00:05:50.560> would<00:05:50.710> have<00:05:50.830> scared<00:05:51.010> him<00:05:51.190> off

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:51.370 
that pinky would have scared him off

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:53.430 
that pinky would have scared him off
rather<00:05:51.700> than<00:05:51.820> it<00:05:52.090> just<00:05:52.120> be<00:05:52.570> personality

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:53.440 
rather than it just be personality

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:55.590 
rather than it just be personality
differences<00:05:53.950> the<00:05:54.550> personality<00:05:55.150> differences

00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:55.600 
differences the personality differences

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:57.240 
differences the personality differences
moral<00:05:55.930> would<00:05:56.080> be<00:05:56.230> much<00:05:56.410> better<00:05:56.440> placed<00:05:56.980> in<00:05:57.160> an

00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:57.250 
moral would be much better placed in an

00:05:57.250 --> 00:05:59.700 
moral would be much better placed in an
episode<00:05:57.490> like<00:05:57.850> Maud<00:05:58.090> pie<00:05:58.380> immoral<00:05:59.380> I<00:05:59.470> think

00:05:59.700 --> 00:05:59.710 
episode like Maud pie immoral I think

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:00.840 
episode like Maud pie immoral I think
would<00:05:59.830> have<00:05:59.920> been<00:06:00.070> really<00:06:00.220> good<00:06:00.460> would<00:06:00.670> be

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:00.850 
would have been really good would be

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:02.790 
would have been really good would be
what<00:06:01.060> I<00:06:01.090> said<00:06:01.330> earlier<00:06:01.360> the<00:06:01.960> implied<00:06:02.290> moral<00:06:02.620> of

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:02.800 
what I said earlier the implied moral of

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:04.890 
what I said earlier the implied moral of
this<00:06:02.920> episode<00:06:03.250> that<00:06:04.120> to<00:06:04.240> gain<00:06:04.420> a<00:06:04.450> friend<00:06:04.660> you

00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:04.900 
this episode that to gain a friend you

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:06.480 
this episode that to gain a friend you
must<00:06:05.020> first<00:06:05.290> be<00:06:05.530> a<00:06:05.560> friend<00:06:05.890> and<00:06:06.100> meet<00:06:06.280> him<00:06:06.400> at

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:09.060 
must first be a friend and meet him at
his<00:06:06.550> level<00:06:07.020> so<00:06:08.020> in<00:06:08.170> all<00:06:08.350> I'd<00:06:08.560> say<00:06:08.590> this<00:06:08.860> is<00:06:09.040> a

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:09.070 
his level so in all I'd say this is a

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:11.010 
his level so in all I'd say this is a
really<00:06:09.400> well<00:06:09.430> scripted<00:06:09.850> episode<00:06:10.450> there<00:06:10.900> were

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:11.020 
really well scripted episode there were

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:13.920 
really well scripted episode there were
a<00:06:11.050> couple<00:06:11.110> of<00:06:11.850> points<00:06:12.850> but<00:06:13.030> mostly<00:06:13.480> it's<00:06:13.690> like

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:13.930 
a couple of points but mostly it's like

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:16.790 
a couple of points but mostly it's like
heck<00:06:14.260> es<00:06:14.640> the<00:06:15.640> animation<00:06:16.150> gets<00:06:16.480> a<00:06:16.540> gold<00:06:16.660> star

00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:16.800

00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:19.540 
the more outs a pretty well fits it does

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:21.300 
the more outs a pretty well fits it does
fit<00:06:19.780> for<00:06:19.930> the<00:06:20.020> episode<00:06:20.470> it's<00:06:20.680> not<00:06:20.860> the<00:06:21.040> best

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:21.310 
fit for the episode it's not the best

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:22.980 
fit for the episode it's not the best
moral<00:06:21.790> but<00:06:22.030> it<00:06:22.210> sort<00:06:22.480> of<00:06:22.540> fits<00:06:22.660> for<00:06:22.900> the
