00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:30.410 
better than using a regular gun but you

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:35.350 
better than using a regular gun but you
know<00:03:30.620> how<00:03:30.650> it<00:03:30.860> is<00:03:33.400> but<00:03:34.400> yeah<00:03:34.730> these<00:03:35.000> kids<00:03:35.060> are

right<00:04:09.050> now<00:04:09.170> in<00:04:09.350> Minecraft<00:04:09.800> but<00:04:09.920> I'm<00:04:10.130> thinking

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:10.340 
right now in Minecraft but I'm thinking

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:12.250 
right now in Minecraft but I'm thinking
about<00:04:10.370> going<00:04:10.700> off<00:04:10.970> somewhere<00:04:11.720> else<00:04:11.900> in<00:04:12.140> my

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:12.260 
about going off somewhere else in my

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.320 
about going off somewhere else in my
world<00:04:12.440> and<00:04:12.680> making<00:04:12.800> the<00:04:13.010> whole<00:04:13.220> whole<00:04:14.180> new

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:14.330 
world and making the whole whole new

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:17.620 
world and making the whole whole new
house<00:04:14.860> which<00:04:15.860> is<00:04:16.220> just<00:04:17.120> starting<00:04:17.480> from

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:17.630 
house which is just starting from

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:21.220 
house which is just starting from
scratch<00:04:17.870> but<00:04:18.170> nothing<00:04:19.600> again<00:04:20.600> and<00:04:20.840> do<00:04:21.200> a

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:21.230 
scratch but nothing again and do a

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:23.200 
scratch but nothing again and do a
gameplay<00:04:21.710> of<00:04:21.740> that<00:04:22.040> which<00:04:22.370> I<00:04:22.670> guess<00:04:23.030> would<00:04:23.180> be

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:23.210 
gameplay of that which I guess would be

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:27.220 
gameplay of that which I guess would be
pretty<00:04:23.510> cool<00:04:25.240> and<00:04:26.240> what<00:04:26.660> other<00:04:26.780> modern

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:27.230 
pretty cool and what other modern

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:28.750

were using total radars too but maybe I

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:08.800 
were using total radars too but maybe I
should<00:05:06.890> stop<00:05:07.190> using<00:05:07.400> them<00:05:07.820> since<00:05:07.880> we<00:05:08.360> are<00:05:08.480> kind

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:08.810 
should stop using them since we are kind

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:17.430 
should stop using them since we are kind
of<00:05:08.870> winning<00:05:09.140> by<00:05:09.320> a<00:05:09.350> lot<00:05:09.530> I<00:05:11.350> don't<00:05:12.350> know<00:05:14.260> yeah<00:05:15.260> so
