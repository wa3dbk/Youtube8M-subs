00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:44.140 
actually I'm really enjoying my progress
on<00:00:41.870> it<00:00:42.020> as<00:00:42.650> you'll<00:00:42.950> see<00:00:43.190> I'm<00:00:43.400> still<00:00:43.790> doing<00:00:44.030> that

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:44.150 
on it as you'll see I'm still doing that

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:45.640 
on it as you'll see I'm still doing that
thing<00:00:44.210> we're<00:00:44.480> all<00:00:44.540> set<00:00:44.840> up<00:00:44.960> using<00:00:45.260> a<00:00:45.290> deep<00:00:45.530> hour

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:45.650 
thing we're all set up using a deep hour

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:47.260 
thing we're all set up using a deep hour
some<00:00:45.920> people<00:00:46.130> wondering<00:00:46.400> why<00:00:46.640> use<00:00:46.910> the<00:00:47.030> added

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:47.270 
some people wondering why use the added

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:50.470 
some people wondering why use the added
powers<00:00:47.510> it's<00:00:48.110> because<00:00:48.560> it<00:00:48.890> allows<00:00:49.250> my<00:00:49.550> heel<00:00:50.000> to

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:50.480 
powers it's because it allows my heel to

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:51.729 
powers it's because it allows my heel to
be<00:00:50.630> three<00:00:50.990> quarters<00:00:51.230> of<00:00:51.260> inch<00:00:51.440> off<00:00:51.590> the<00:00:51.620> ground

00:00:51.729 --> 00:00:51.739 
be three quarters of inch off the ground

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:53.710 
be three quarters of inch off the ground
so<00:00:52.280> it<00:00:52.489> really<00:00:52.730> allows<00:00:53.239> you<00:00:53.420> to<00:00:53.450> have<00:00:53.600> your

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:53.720 
so it really allows you to have your

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:55.330 
so it really allows you to have your
foot<00:00:53.960> higher<00:00:54.320> so<00:00:54.650> you<00:00:54.739> don't<00:00:54.890> have<00:00:55.040> to<00:00:55.130> worry

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:55.340 
foot higher so you don't have to worry

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:57.880 
foot higher so you don't have to worry
about<00:00:55.430> it<00:00:55.579> lifting<00:00:55.940> off<00:00:56.060> as<00:00:56.239> much<00:00:56.500> so<00:00:57.500> mine<00:00:57.739> the

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:57.890 
about it lifting off as much so mine the

00:00:57.890 --> 00:00:59.710 
about it lifting off as much so mine the
entire<00:00:58.220> time<00:00:58.489> and<00:00:58.610> I'm<00:00:58.700> doing<00:00:58.880> these<00:00:58.940> reps

00:00:59.710 --> 00:00:59.720 
entire time and I'm doing these reps

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:01.360 
entire time and I'm doing these reps
these<00:00:59.930> sets<00:01:00.200> my<00:01:00.649> feet<00:01:00.890> never<00:01:01.010> come<00:01:01.190> off<00:01:01.250> the

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:01.370 
these sets my feet never come off the

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:02.920 
these sets my feet never come off the
ground<00:01:01.579> so<00:01:01.760> I'm<00:01:01.820> really<00:01:01.940> working<00:01:02.239> on<00:01:02.300> that<00:01:02.360> the

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:02.930 
ground so I'm really working on that the

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:04.570 
ground so I'm really working on that the
reason<00:01:03.140> I<00:01:03.200> use<00:01:03.350> the<00:01:03.380> belt<00:01:03.739> is<00:01:04.159> because<00:01:04.460> you're

I kind of flex a little bit right here
in<00:01:30.110> this<00:01:30.229> shot<00:01:30.470> but<00:01:30.710> it<00:01:30.950> doesn't<00:01:31.250> actually

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:31.340 
in this shot but it doesn't actually

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:33.910 
in this shot but it doesn't actually
raise<00:01:31.700> off<00:01:31.940> the<00:01:32.119> bench<00:01:32.619> eventually<00:01:33.619> I<00:01:33.680> want<00:01:33.799> to

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:33.920 
raise off the bench eventually I want to

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:35.289 
raise off the bench eventually I want to
wear<00:01:34.040> some<00:01:34.190> like<00:01:34.280> tighter<00:01:34.490> shorts<00:01:34.909> and<00:01:35.119> get

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:35.299 
wear some like tighter shorts and get

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:37.270 
wear some like tighter shorts and get
like<00:01:35.479> a<00:01:35.570> really<00:01:35.840> good<00:01:35.990> side<00:01:36.260> shot<00:01:36.590> of<00:01:36.619> dead-ass

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:37.280 
like a really good side shot of dead-ass

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:39.789 
like a really good side shot of dead-ass
so<00:01:38.119> I<00:01:38.150> can<00:01:38.659> see<00:01:39.229> if<00:01:39.350> it's<00:01:39.470> coming<00:01:39.680> off<00:01:39.770> the

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:39.799 
so I can see if it's coming off the

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:41.020 
so I can see if it's coming off the
bench<00:01:40.070> because<00:01:40.310> that's<00:01:40.520> what<00:01:40.640> I<00:01:40.670> really<00:01:40.880> don't

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:41.030 
bench because that's what I really don't

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:44.080 
bench because that's what I really don't
do<00:01:41.240> but<00:01:41.920> as<00:01:42.920> you<00:01:43.280> guys<00:01:43.400> know<00:01:43.610> whenever<00:01:43.909> you<00:01:44.000> do

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:44.090 
do but as you guys know whenever you do

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:45.340 
do but as you guys know whenever you do
any<00:01:44.270> sort<00:01:44.450> of<00:01:44.600> lift<00:01:44.750> you<00:01:44.869> should<00:01:45.020> always<00:01:45.110> start

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:45.350 
any sort of lift you should always start

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:46.750 
any sort of lift you should always start
off<00:01:45.439> with<00:01:45.650> the<00:01:45.740> lift<00:01:46.010> that's<00:01:46.430> gonna<00:01:46.549> be<00:01:46.670> the

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:46.760 
off with the lift that's gonna be the

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:48.190 
off with the lift that's gonna be the
hardest<00:01:47.060> at<00:01:47.240> first<00:01:47.510> it's<00:01:47.659> gonna<00:01:47.750> exert<00:01:48.080> the

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:48.200 
hardest at first it's gonna exert the

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:49.810 
hardest at first it's gonna exert the
most<00:01:48.229> energy<00:01:48.650> so<00:01:49.040> that<00:01:49.100> is<00:01:49.250> why<00:01:49.340> I<00:01:49.369> start<00:01:49.729> off

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:49.820 
most energy so that is why I start off

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:51.039 
most energy so that is why I start off
with<00:01:49.850> the<00:01:50.060> flat<00:01:50.270> bench<00:01:50.479> obviously<00:01:50.900> because

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:51.049 
with the flat bench obviously because

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:53.560 
with the flat bench obviously because
I'm<00:01:51.110> doing<00:01:51.200> the<00:01:51.350> 5<00:01:51.500> by<00:01:51.650> 5<00:01:51.860> I<00:01:52.189> used<00:01:53.030> to<00:01:53.180> start<00:01:53.420> off

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:53.570 
I'm doing the 5 by 5 I used to start off

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:56.320 
I'm doing the 5 by 5 I used to start off
with<00:01:53.810> it<00:01:53.960> an<00:01:54.320> incline<00:01:54.830> because<00:01:55.820> that<00:01:56.060> was<00:01:56.210> what

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:56.330 
with it an incline because that was what

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:58.450 
with it an incline because that was what
I<00:01:56.360> you<00:01:56.720> know<00:01:56.840> a<00:01:57.020> cared<00:01:57.560> more<00:01:57.770> about<00:01:57.830> so<00:01:58.430> I

00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:58.460 
I you know a cared more about so I

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:00.149 
I you know a cared more about so I
wanted<00:01:58.850> to<00:01:58.939> increase<00:01:59.330> the<00:01:59.600> incline<00:01:59.840> bench

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:00.159 
wanted to increase the incline bench

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:02.980 
wanted to increase the incline bench
when<00:02:01.159> I<00:02:01.220> was<00:02:01.310> doing<00:02:01.490> dumbbells<00:02:01.850> or<00:02:02.060> a<00:02:02.150> I<00:02:02.600> wanted

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:02.990 
when I was doing dumbbells or a I wanted

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:05.649 
when I was doing dumbbells or a I wanted
to<00:02:03.049> increase<00:02:03.290> my<00:02:03.409> upper<00:02:04.040> chest<00:02:04.070> the<00:02:04.520> most<00:02:04.880> and

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:05.659 
to increase my upper chest the most and

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:07.990 
to increase my upper chest the most and
I<00:02:05.720> felt<00:02:05.960> that<00:02:06.140> the<00:02:06.590> incline<00:02:07.460> bench<00:02:07.670> was<00:02:07.880> the

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:08.000 
I felt that the incline bench was the

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.909 
I felt that the incline bench was the
best<00:02:08.209> exercise<00:02:08.810> for<00:02:08.840> that<00:02:09.259> so<00:02:09.409> I<00:02:09.469> started<00:02:09.529> off

00:02:09.909 --> 00:02:09.919 
best exercise for that so I started off

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:12.459 
best exercise for that so I started off
with<00:02:10.039> it<00:02:10.189> first<00:02:10.459> so<00:02:11.029> since<00:02:11.749> I<00:02:11.840> do<00:02:11.900> some<00:02:12.139> incline

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:12.469 
with it first so since I do some incline

00:02:12.469 --> 00:02:13.170 
with it first so since I do some incline
ii

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
ii

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:15.479 
ii
it<00:02:13.390> obviously<00:02:13.569> is<00:02:13.810> gonna<00:02:14.019> affect<00:02:14.349> my<00:02:15.010> strength

00:02:15.479 --> 00:02:15.489 
it obviously is gonna affect my strength

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:18.199 
it obviously is gonna affect my strength
in<00:02:15.760> it<00:02:15.879> how<00:02:16.060> many<00:02:16.239> reps<00:02:16.480> sets<00:02:16.870> I<00:02:16.989> can<00:02:17.170> do<00:02:17.349> but

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:18.209 
in it how many reps sets I can do but

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:20.220 
in it how many reps sets I can do but
everything's<00:02:19.209> going<00:02:19.510> really<00:02:19.629> fantastic<00:02:20.200> I

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.230 
everything's going really fantastic I

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:22.050 
everything's going really fantastic I
don't<00:02:20.379> mind<00:02:20.590> start<00:02:20.860> off<00:02:20.950> the<00:02:21.069> flat<00:02:21.280> bench<00:02:21.519> a<00:02:21.819> hi

00:02:34.979 --> 00:02:34.989 
of the meat that I'm going to do is like

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:38.069 
of the meat that I'm going to do is like
4<00:02:35.379> or<00:02:35.409> 5<00:02:35.709> months<00:02:35.920> out<00:02:36.159> it<00:02:36.579> is<00:02:36.760> in<00:02:36.909> June<00:02:37.359> so<00:02:38.049> I

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:38.079 
4 or 5 months out it is in June so I

00:02:38.079 --> 00:02:40.229 
4 or 5 months out it is in June so I
have<00:02:38.290> plenty<00:02:38.620> of<00:02:38.859> time<00:02:39.310> to<00:02:39.370> practice<00:02:39.790> my<00:02:40.030> paws

00:02:40.229 --> 00:02:40.239 
have plenty of time to practice my paws

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:41.699 
have plenty of time to practice my paws
and<00:02:40.420> reps<00:02:40.569> I<00:02:40.659> honestly<00:02:40.959> won't<00:02:41.200> probably<00:02:41.349> start

00:02:41.699 --> 00:02:41.709 
and reps I honestly won't probably start

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:43.949 
and reps I honestly won't probably start
practicing<00:02:42.189> pause<00:02:42.370> reps<00:02:42.640> until<00:02:43.269> maybe<00:02:43.420> one

00:02:43.949 --> 00:02:43.959 
practicing pause reps until maybe one

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:46.020 
practicing pause reps until maybe one
two<00:02:44.290> maybe<00:02:44.560> two<00:02:44.739> months<00:02:45.220> before<00:02:45.370> the<00:02:45.639> meet<00:02:45.849> I

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.030 
two maybe two months before the meet I

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:47.280 
two maybe two months before the meet I
really<00:02:46.450> want<00:02:46.599> to<00:02:46.659> focus<00:02:46.750> on<00:02:46.989> getting<00:02:47.049> my

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.290 
really want to focus on getting my

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:49.319 
really want to focus on getting my
strength<00:02:47.739> up<00:02:47.920> first<00:02:48.190> because<00:02:48.700> I<00:02:48.730> think<00:02:49.120> that

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:49.329 
strength up first because I think that

00:02:49.329 --> 00:02:51.660 
strength up first because I think that
is<00:02:49.510> gonna<00:02:49.599> be<00:02:49.780> the<00:02:49.900> most<00:02:50.230> important<00:02:50.829> thing<00:02:51.549> to

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:51.670 
is gonna be the most important thing to

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:52.979 
is gonna be the most important thing to
worry<00:02:51.879> about<00:02:51.909> before<00:02:52.389> I<00:02:52.420> worry<00:02:52.659> about<00:02:52.750> the

00:02:52.979 --> 00:02:52.989 
worry about before I worry about the

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:54.720 
worry about before I worry about the
pause<00:02:53.230> I<00:02:53.500> want<00:02:53.590> to<00:02:53.709> get<00:02:53.799> the<00:02:53.859> actual<00:02:54.129> numbers

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:54.730 
pause I want to get the actual numbers

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:56.129 
pause I want to get the actual numbers
up<00:02:55.000> and<00:02:55.209> then<00:02:55.659> we're<00:02:55.780> about<00:02:55.900> the<00:02:55.959> pause

00:02:56.129 --> 00:02:56.139 
up and then we're about the pause

00:02:56.139 --> 00:02:57.360 
up and then we're about the pause
because<00:02:56.470> I<00:02:56.530> you<00:02:56.590> know<00:02:56.680> my<00:02:56.859> goal<00:02:57.040> is<00:02:57.159> to<00:02:57.250> hit

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:57.370 
because I you know my goal is to hit

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:59.009 
because I you know my goal is to hit
maybe<00:02:57.519> a<00:02:57.730> little<00:02:57.819> over<00:02:58.090> 250<00:02:58.569> and<00:02:58.720> a<00:02:58.810> pause

00:02:59.009 --> 00:02:59.019 
maybe a little over 250 and a pause

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:02.789 
maybe a little over 250 and a pause
bench<00:02:59.379> which<00:03:00.159> I<00:03:00.489> think<00:03:01.060> would<00:03:01.239> be<00:03:01.349> pretty<00:03:02.349> cool

00:03:02.789 --> 00:03:02.799

extension<00:05:01.870> so<00:05:01.990> what<00:05:02.080> I<00:05:02.140> like<00:05:02.230> to<00:05:02.290> do<00:05:02.410> is<00:05:02.530> this

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:02.650 
extension so what I like to do is this

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:04.370 
extension so what I like to do is this
because<00:05:02.920> the<00:05:03.100> the<00:05:03.310> hand<00:05:03.550> is<00:05:03.730> supinated

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:04.380 
because the the hand is supinated

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:06.930 
because the the hand is supinated
instead<00:05:05.380> of<00:05:05.530> you<00:05:06.100> know<00:05:06.220> kind<00:05:06.520> of<00:05:06.610> like<00:05:06.730> hammer

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:06.940 
instead of you know kind of like hammer

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:08.730 
instead of you know kind of like hammer
strength<00:05:07.270> so<00:05:07.630> it<00:05:07.780> kind<00:05:07.990> of<00:05:08.050> can<00:05:08.260> hit<00:05:08.590> the

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:08.740 
strength so it kind of can hit the

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:10.890 
strength so it kind of can hit the
tricep<00:05:09.130> a<00:05:09.160> little<00:05:09.400> differently<00:05:09.730> you<00:05:10.690> really
