00:00:02.419 --> 00:00:05.809 

so<00:00:03.419> this<00:00:03.780> is<00:00:03.810> now<00:00:03.959> in<00:00:04.529> video<00:00:04.830> mode<00:00:04.859> I'm<00:00:05.640> going

00:00:05.809 --> 00:00:05.819 
so this is now in video mode I'm going

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:07.579 
so this is now in video mode I'm going
to<00:00:05.879> get<00:00:06.000> demonstrates<00:00:06.660> the<00:00:06.899> benefits<00:00:07.379> of

00:00:07.579 --> 00:00:07.589 
to get demonstrates the benefits of

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:10.640 
to get demonstrates the benefits of
having<00:00:07.859> optical<00:00:08.580> image<00:00:08.910> stabilization<00:00:09.650> now

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:10.650 
having optical image stabilization now

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.549 
having optical image stabilization now
you<00:00:10.710> can<00:00:10.920> see<00:00:11.130> it's<00:00:11.759> not<00:00:11.910> recording<00:00:12.480> so<00:00:13.410> the

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.559 
you can see it's not recording so the

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:16.250 
you can see it's not recording so the
stabilization<00:00:14.429> is<00:00:14.549> so<00:00:14.759> you<00:00:15.599> can<00:00:15.750> see<00:00:15.929> what

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
stabilization is so you can see what

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.410 
stabilization is so you can see what
happens<00:00:16.650> when<00:00:16.859> we<00:00:17.010> hit<00:00:17.220> record<00:00:17.609> and<00:00:17.820> the<00:00:17.970> OAS

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
happens when we hit record and the OAS

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.500 
happens when we hit record and the OAS
kitchen<00:00:19.369> so<00:00:20.369> now<00:00:20.490> it's<00:00:20.640> recording<00:00:20.760> I'm<00:00:21.240> still

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
kitchen so now it's recording I'm still

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.570 
kitchen so now it's recording I'm still
doing<00:00:21.630> the<00:00:21.810> exactly<00:00:22.109> same<00:00:22.230> shape<00:00:22.650> you<00:00:23.250> can<00:00:23.400> see

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
doing the exactly same shape you can see

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:28.700 
doing the exactly same shape you can see
that<00:00:24.019> it's<00:00:25.019> practically<00:00:25.470> waving<00:00:27.349> and<00:00:28.349> it's

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
that it's practically waving and it's

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.560 
that it's practically waving and it's
not<00:00:28.890> even<00:00:28.920> a<00:00:29.310> standard<00:00:29.789> handshake<00:00:30.240> it's<00:00:30.449> a

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
not even a standard handshake it's a

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.240 
not even a standard handshake it's a
proper<00:00:30.900> if<00:00:31.050> you<00:00:31.170> have<00:00:31.349> this<00:00:31.529> hand<00:00:31.830> stick<00:00:32.040> we

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
proper if you have this hand stick we

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.610 
proper if you have this hand stick we
spoke<00:00:32.489> to<00:00:32.610> the<00:00:32.640> doctor<00:00:33.090> type<00:00:33.270> of<00:00:33.450> moment<00:00:34.260> that

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
spoke to the doctor type of moment that

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.569 
spoke to the doctor type of moment that
we<00:00:34.770> are<00:00:34.860> in<00:00:35.100> here

00:00:36.569 --> 00:00:36.579 
we are in here

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:38.369 
we are in here
so<00:00:37.120> that's<00:00:37.329> the<00:00:37.480> benefit<00:00:37.839> of<00:00:37.960> having<00:00:38.109> always

00:00:38.369 --> 00:00:38.379 
so that's the benefit of having always

00:00:38.379 --> 00:00:41.340 
so that's the benefit of having always
in<00:00:38.859> video<00:00:39.129> we<00:00:39.940> do<00:00:40.149> another<00:00:40.570> with<00:00:40.839> them<00:00:40.989> the

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:41.350 
in video we do another with them the

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:46.970 
in video we do another with them the
handheld<00:00:41.890> video<00:00:42.010> from<00:00:42.429> this<00:00:42.699> concise<00:00:43.210> food

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.740 

a<00:00:47.070> 10<00:00:48.000> second<00:00:48.329> video

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:01:02.800 

and<00:00:51.930> the<00:00:52.200> harmful

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:02.810 

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:05.049 

and<00:01:03.290> now<00:01:03.470> when<00:01:03.680> you<00:01:03.740> play<00:01:03.950> back<00:01:04.160> the<00:01:04.309> video<00:01:04.489> you

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:05.059 
and now when you play back the video you

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:06.610 
and now when you play back the video you
can<00:01:05.180> see<00:01:05.390> how<00:01:05.570> it<00:01:05.630> looks<00:01:05.810> like<00:01:06.140> there<00:01:06.320> is<00:01:06.350> being

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:06.620 
can see how it looks like there is being

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:09.160 
can see how it looks like there is being
practically<00:01:07.070> short<00:01:07.390> with<00:01:08.390> a<00:01:08.420> tripod<00:01:08.690> or

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:09.170 
practically short with a tripod or

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:25.720 
practically short with a tripod or
steadicam<00:01:10.040> or<00:01:12.100> something

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:25.730 

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:27.490 

okay<00:01:26.330> now<00:01:26.510> we<00:01:26.570> have<00:01:26.720> some<00:01:26.870> side-by-side

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:27.500 
okay now we have some side-by-side

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:29.380 
okay now we have some side-by-side
comparison<00:01:28.100> videos<00:01:28.400> okay<00:01:29.030> so<00:01:29.090> on<00:01:29.360> the

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:29.390 
comparison videos okay so on the

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:31.300 
comparison videos okay so on the
right-hand<00:01:29.630> side<00:01:29.900> we<00:01:30.050> have<00:01:30.290> the<00:01:30.470> Lumia<00:01:30.830> 920

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:31.310 
right-hand side we have the Lumia 920

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:33.250 
right-hand side we have the Lumia 920
three<00:01:31.520> of<00:01:31.610> you<00:01:31.760> on<00:01:32.330> the<00:01:32.510> left-hand<00:01:32.990> side<00:01:33.080> we

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:33.260 
three of you on the left-hand side we

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:34.920 
three of you on the left-hand side we
have<00:01:33.470> one<00:01:33.860> of<00:01:33.890> our<00:01:34.040> from<00:01:34.340> competing

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:34.930 
have one of our from competing

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:37.690 
have one of our from competing
smartphones<00:01:35.930> and<00:01:36.230> pay<00:01:36.980> attention<00:01:37.010> that<00:01:37.580> the

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:37.700 
smartphones and pay attention that the

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:39.850 
smartphones and pay attention that the
left<00:01:37.880> hand<00:01:38.060> side<00:01:38.150> device<00:01:39.080> actually<00:01:39.410> has

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:39.860 
left hand side device actually has

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:42.580 
left hand side device actually has
digital<00:01:40.510> stabilization<00:01:41.510> enabled<00:01:42.050> you<00:01:42.560> can

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:42.590 
digital stabilization enabled you can

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:45.750 
digital stabilization enabled you can
see<00:01:42.890> how<00:01:43.100> oh<00:01:43.430> it's<00:01:44.210> not<00:01:44.420> doesn't<00:01:44.870> manage<00:01:45.230> to

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:45.760 
see how oh it's not doesn't manage to

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:48.190 
see how oh it's not doesn't manage to
compensate<00:01:46.760> for<00:01:46.940> the<00:01:47.030> handshake<00:01:47.450> understand

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:48.200 
compensate for the handshake understand

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:51.250 
compensate for the handshake understand
