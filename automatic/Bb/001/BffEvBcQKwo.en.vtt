00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:21.379
 this is actually also possible 

00:07:19.159 --> 00:07:22.520
 unfortunately unfortunately here it is the photo limit 

00:07:21.379 --> 00:07:24.229
 just not as long as a point limit 

00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:26.530
 just something as long as before 

00:07:24.229 --> 00:07:28.819

00:07:26.530 --> 00:07:30.199

00:07:28.819 --> 00:07:31.250
 duty that afterwards also it is on it and 

00:07:30.199 --> 00:07:32.840
 remains call of duty as a nice 

00:07:31.250 --> 00:07:34.430
 view of the guy and then have to 

00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:36.889

00:07:38.659 --> 00:07:43.819
 6006 jar 2 and this was natural 

00:07:41.930 --> 00:07:45.650

00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:51.379
 just fixed or pericles as i mine 

00:07:50.180 --> 00:07:53.960
 I might have had a good class 

00:07:51.379 --> 00:07:56.509
 but by little your own fault goes thick 

00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:58.550
