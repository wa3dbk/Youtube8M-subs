00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:13.600
 if they are good 

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:15.160
 and the one everybody knew welcome 

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:16.780
 for this new video we find ourselves 

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:17.320
 today sion diablo iii it was 

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:19.900
 long ago 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:21.250
 and knowing that patch 2.0 is finally 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:23.410
 pulled out I decided to make you a 

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:25.180
 little video to present a run xp 

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:27.279
 I discovered on the king stream 

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:31.330
 kong gold on twitter 

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:33.370
 and so it's a wine it's abused 

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:35.110
 say that like that because it allows you 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:37.080
 in a matter of seconds to fill 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:39.100
 entire bubbles of your xp bar 

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:40.900
 by the way this king kong gold made a 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:42.280
 video it shows you how to move from 

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:42.670
 level 1 and level 60 in a few 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:45.070
 seconds 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:46.710
 so we have to create a part in the 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:49.570
 maximum difficulty you can go there 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.190
 go to the rooms of agony level 3 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:52.870
 as you can see here there is a 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:54.059
 safe and that's offered here that will 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:57.220
 we will play 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:58.989
 the goal of the game is to kill an about 100 

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:00.489
 creatures a minimum story of 

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:01.839
 unlock a bonus chest is to do 

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:04.720
 a maximum of experience and you go 

00:01:01.839 --> 00:01:05.920
 see here it looks very fast and the 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:08.470
 purpose of the game it's going to be just or 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:09.420
 two all clean so I will not you 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:11.100
 present my balance sheet 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.869
 I would probably do it live at 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.100
 the occasion but as we can see 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:17.190
 in my pool literally about 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:19.650
 nobles power right there 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:21.570
 the counter of me will kill that fills up 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.860
 little by little we have increased a little 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.910
 difficulty compared to our last 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.770
 rounds I do not know if we will necessarily 

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:27.990
 reach the bonus chest that would be cool 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.060
 but I'm putting you in enlargements of 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:33.120
 marble xp and you will see how much that 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:35.160
 xp just exponentially I 

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:37.260
 I am paragons 103 and it goes up to view 

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:38.370
 it's just awesome but 

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:41.900
 if we continue like this, there is a way 

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:44.910
 we have our bonus already 81 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:52.230
 we have them even very much here 

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:55.130
 bonus chest for man 4 is the value of 

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:55.130
 paragons as long as we are there 

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:58.840
 it's really something 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:00.490
 of extremely simple once you 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:02.140
 have finished on you're going to have your 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:04.390
 second coop I appear you see here 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:05.860
 that the a4 brings in 6 million and in 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:07.360
 opening the two kops you still have 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:09.550
 objects and chances to receive 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:11.590
 legendary inside so that's 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:13.540
 always really super simple we see 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:15.610
 here I did I think almost three 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:17.470
 bubbles just teleport to the city 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:19.480
 to leave the party to revive the 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:21.760
 part and you will have a portal of just 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:23.860
 in front of this place and you can 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:26.080
 directly return continues and get 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:28.330
 chain xp farm and ride your 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:30.940
 let's say very easy as I said 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:32.620
 previously the streamer that I 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:33.700
 watching did that with levels 1 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:35.800
 ie he go with three 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:37.780
 60 levels he wants 60 who will do 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:39.340
 that part there that they will advance 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:41.650
 tuna clean the area around and the 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:43.300
 level 1 will hide and survive and 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:45.310
 win almost 60 xp levels in 

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:46.840
 turning 6 here I hope that this very 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:48.190
 short video will have pleased you i hope that 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:49.750
 I would not have said too much 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:51.670
 and that it will not be too disjointed 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:52.960
 do not hesitate to ask me questions 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:55.720
 in the comments if you want 

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:58.390
 some details in detail and we get 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:00.910
 find tonight at 6 pm Thursday 27 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:02.739
 February for a live diablo iii 2.0 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:05.700
 thank you all and see you soon for more 

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:05.700
 videos on my lives 

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:11.760
 this morning I 'm not going to 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:14.150
 exceed a pickaxe I have no silence 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:14.150
 in my dec 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:20.070
 hence its mark 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:21.660
 he wants to kill her he's forced to go out 

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:25.190
 a spell that it's dangerous a 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:25.190
 advantage of cards on this trade
