to - possibly just take off now the
second<00:01:27.180> plan<00:01:27.390> over<00:01:27.659> here<00:01:27.900> this<00:01:28.530> plant<00:01:28.860> gets

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:29.240 
second plan over here this plant gets

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:32.719 
second plan over here this plant gets

around<00:01:55.860> this<00:01:56.009> side<00:01:56.310> there's<00:01:57.149> a<00:01:57.240> nice<00:01:57.420> one

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
around this side there's a nice one

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.249 
around this side there's a nice one
there<00:01:57.710> this<00:01:58.710> one<00:01:58.920> is<00:01:59.070> is<00:01:59.689> moving<00:02:00.689> around<00:02:00.810> a<00:02:01.079> lot

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
there this one is is moving around a lot

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:02.929 
there this one is is moving around a lot
faster

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
faster

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:05.240 
faster
I<00:02:03.000> mean<00:02:03.930> it's<00:02:04.020> growing<00:02:04.200> a<00:02:04.320> lot<00:02:04.439> faster<00:02:04.920> it's

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
I mean it's growing a lot faster it's

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.429 
I mean it's growing a lot faster it's
just<00:02:05.399> healthy<00:02:05.610> looking<00:02:06.060> all<00:02:06.180> around<00:02:06.210> does<00:02:07.200> not

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
just healthy looking all around does not

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:10.540 
just healthy looking all around does not
allow<00:02:07.649> any<00:02:07.680> dead<00:02:08.099> leaves<00:02:08.369> that<00:02:08.520> I<00:02:08.640> can<00:02:08.819> see<00:02:09.289> so

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:10.550 
allow any dead leaves that I can see so

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:12.979 
allow any dead leaves that I can see so
I'm<00:02:11.550> saying<00:02:12.000> that<00:02:12.150> this<00:02:12.390> one's<00:02:12.629> looking

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 
I'm saying that this one's looking

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:13.700 
I'm saying that this one's looking
better

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
better

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:18.590 
better
tomatoes<00:02:14.580> already<00:02:14.850> growing<00:02:15.260> so<00:02:16.260> I<00:02:17.600> honestly

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:18.600 
tomatoes already growing so I honestly

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.630 
tomatoes already growing so I honestly
thought<00:02:19.410> the<00:02:19.620> topsy<00:02:19.950> turvy<00:02:19.980> would<00:02:20.340> keep<00:02:20.490> up

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
thought the topsy turvy would keep up

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.970 
thought the topsy turvy would keep up
with<00:02:20.790> it<00:02:20.880> if<00:02:21.000> not<00:02:21.180> do<00:02:21.300> better<00:02:21.450> but<00:02:21.810> so<00:02:22.500> far<00:02:22.710> this

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
with it if not do better but so far this

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:24.290 
with it if not do better but so far this
one<00:02:23.160> is<00:02:23.310> doing<00:02:23.610> better<00:02:23.760> and<00:02:23.940> that<00:02:24.060> doesn't

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300 
one is doing better and that doesn't

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:26.630 
one is doing better and that doesn't
mean<00:02:24.390> anything<00:02:24.480> we're<00:02:25.380> going<00:02:25.590> to<00:02:25.860> be<00:02:26.430> able<00:02:26.520> to

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
mean anything we're going to be able to

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.550 
mean anything we're going to be able to
look<00:02:26.880> at<00:02:27.120> more<00:02:27.720> of<00:02:27.810> a<00:02:27.870> comparison<00:02:28.260> as<00:02:28.470> this

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
look at more of a comparison as this

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:29.540 
look at more of a comparison as this
thing<00:02:28.770> grows<00:02:28.890> further

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550 
thing grows further

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:31.850 
thing grows further
so<00:02:30.000> there's<00:02:30.210> your<00:02:30.330> update<00:02:30.630> right<00:02:30.810> now<00:02:30.990> there's
