00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:10.410
 suffer one here with another video 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.019
 for you 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:15.059
 in this video guys I'm going to make a video 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:18.720
 which showed in the comex some servers 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:20.369
 ae dow what are luis to win items right? 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.480
 better known as servers for 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:23.970
 always win 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:27.689
 So, people, I do not know that. 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:30.840
 but I 'll give you a bath there too 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:34.320
 about it before entering it under 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:36.210
 that this service for example here and 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.290
 I'll teach you how to get into it. 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:42.690
 then it will only end from here 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:44.940
 type c is just a server you get 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.410
 You can stop tonight from calling him. 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.930
 because only sometimes the game closes 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:56.129
 so sometimes my bad 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:59.520
 at least 17 and then we're going there 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:02.520
 wait time there spend no time there 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:05.700
 project, I'm going to spend time passing 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:08.850
 Quick there just for you to see how it is 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:11.180
 I'll slow down there at the end of the 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.180
 guys 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.880
 the field 

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:55.370
 O 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:04.200
 So people coming here at the end. 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:07.530
 of the match 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:09.630
 I am the lady, do not change anything by taking 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:12.330
 doubts to that someone is doubt 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:14.070
 does not change anything, you kill someone or are 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:17.820
 stopped because cash was already coming in 

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:19.980
 and have not done anything for 

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:21.870
 example you get a computer box and 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:25.560
 I did a lot the number from a 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:27.120
 black won did nothing but is there and 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:29.490
 The boat, let's see if you 're in the 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:32.270
 listinha and the boat 

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:35.010
 nor in the list thai chromatic range 

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:38.550
 You'll see what I was talking about. 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:40.740
 so now I 'm going to take it off from 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:45.030
 from here and I'll teach you how to connect 

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:46.560
 in a departure from the trade of 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:51.240
 This product comes from 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:52.860
 community comes from an international research 

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:55.580
 to and from 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:58.930
 dl e 

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:58.930
 the quick update 

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:04.620
 there the servants find law and a 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:07.020
 So, how many more people in the 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:08.670
 server more see her father so that 

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:12.930
 it's the same 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:14.870
 so let's go and get in 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:18.379
 server than any 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:21.410
 always walking with his head and we're going 

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:25.610
 see if it will give in what sometimes to him 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:27.860
 And I like guys, I'm already as low as you. 

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:31.520
 It will take a minute 25 

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:37.580
 lowering op this map here is exactly 

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:40.190
 What I was thinking was normal, but it's 

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:43.270
 same type difficult 

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:43.270
 that worked 

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:48.230
 over there 

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:52.930
 You can stay here, but it will not. 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:52.930
 change nothing, kill you, my name, my galera 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:04:02.819
 here I usually get the 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:03.989
 neguev 24 dead with it and 

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:08.849
 buy another not to need 

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:11.519
 recharge that takes a lot and 24 and 25 

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:13.950
 okay let's interests because we cane 

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:15.360
 expect to finish your part had here and 

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:19.760
 people are coming 

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:19.760
 then accelerate there on the screen 

00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:53.960
 So, back here, people. Look at you. 

00:04:51.979 --> 00:04:58.460
 can see that this server is very active 

00:04:53.960 --> 00:05:01.879
 and I so I'm going to leave here again and 

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:04.129
 I'll tell you what I recommend. 

00:05:01.879 --> 00:05:06.710
 Mister servers is not something that you 

00:05:04.129 --> 00:05:10.069
 You have to look right but it is six minutes 

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:11.569
 thing where they do not glass or to 

00:05:10.069 --> 00:05:15.680
 less than a minute and a half 

00:05:11.569 --> 00:05:17.449
 I like jes and I give these with more people. 

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:20.389
 who enters that usually with more people 

00:05:17.449 --> 00:05:22.939
 is the six - minute beauty heartthrob here O 

00:05:20.389 --> 00:05:25.580
 chroma key renews itself 

00:05:22.939 --> 00:05:28.069
 so I 'm going to get into the loot just used 

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:29.719
 While I finish video then guys and 

00:05:28.069 --> 00:05:32.930
 It was the video if you liked the video. 

00:05:29.719 --> 00:05:34.639
 lets like it clear if you do not like it 

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:39.050
 liked it and do not want to leave it too 

00:05:34.639 --> 00:05:40.849
 was deaf opinion is that the writing is not 

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:43.189
 if you want 

00:05:40.849 --> 00:05:46.150
 as you can see here is almost everything 

00:05:43.189 --> 00:05:46.150
 server are the same 

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:58.389
 and this is what the guys are thinking 

00:05:55.960 --> 00:06:02.110
 want to do an active moment everything can 

00:05:58.389 --> 00:06:06.310
 also make tiplo shift f1 

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:08.530
 closing things here ok I see all 

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:11.440
 the achievements can make the achievements 

00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:13.060
 that you want here on these servers sofas 

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:16.270
 Conquest do not want to do what I 

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:19.330
 want to here on the server clear but he 

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:23.380
 has to be valve antich de laurent 

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:26.680
 otherwise you can not only see here 

00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:28.690
 I can do it, I've already done the majority, but it 

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:30.789
 to do it here gold just stay 

00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:33.130
 buying something random and going 

00:06:30.789 --> 00:06:35.770
 winning goal there since that 's it I 

00:06:33.130 --> 00:06:38.350
 I think it's better not to do it on account 

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:41.110
 own, but then people were the 

00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:43.510
 video if you liked it left like only for 

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:45.760
 complementary at the end there 

00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:48.130
 this video that now has ten minutes more 

00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:50.880
 I'm going to accelerate a good part will be with 

00:06:48.130 --> 00:06:50.880
 much less time 

00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:55.830
 said
