 hi guys my name is alexei and in 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:10.740
 In this video, I would like to compare two 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:13.429
 microphone or rather even a few 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:19.920
 compare two microphones to test 

00:00:13.429 --> 00:00:21.930
 new microphone sennheiser md 46 here it is 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:26.930
 literally came to me yesterday on it 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:29.849
 it is written that he made Germany me 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:33.239
 often people used to say when I more often 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:38.460
 I made a video that I was fine 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:41.910
 I am a star picture means great here but 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:44.789
 the sound is lame and I basically agreed 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:47.129
 but I somehow did not care and extra money 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:50.820
 I did not want to waste money 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:53.879
 most what a little came yourself and 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.770
 I think, but there is very no clearer for the audience 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:57.930
 do give why not buy 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:03.260
 normal microphone right now i'm talking 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:08.180
 into the microphone shur he's called a model 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:10.680
 model translated 4080 to someone interesting 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:13.439
 so now I will turn it off 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.750
 and try to connect this new one 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:17.850
 sennheiser which is made specifically for 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:20.100
 street interviews they say he is 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:23.150
 very so professional here let's 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.150
 let's hear the difference 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:35.229
 once-once-once-once and centers check 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:38.350
 studio equipment 

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:40.390
 Hello my name is Alexey and I broadcast 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:43.240
 under the label through new york in this video 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:46.950
 we talk about what we talk why 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:51.909
 I don't know the video yet, but I hope that 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:54.039
 microphone it sounds better than shur 

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:56.619
 which I had right now I was a shur 

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:59.880
 disconnected here and now I will try on 

00:01:56.619 --> 00:02:04.149
 this microphone here to put this cap and 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:06.630
 which kind of wind isolate i don't know 

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:10.090
 how good it will be 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:11.830
 microphone on it looks mine also here i 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:12.459
 I think that the cap is not in principle 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:16.209
 will affect 

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:18.900
 and he is like this 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:21.910
 must catch all the sounds that 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:25.630
 but I will still hang a buttonhole, I think 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:28.030
 But for completeness, but I myself 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:29.799
 didn't listen to how it sounds so let's 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:31.900
 now let's hear everything 

00:02:29.799 --> 00:02:36.030
 here yes you write off whether you liked 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:36.030
 much microphone or not well let's all
