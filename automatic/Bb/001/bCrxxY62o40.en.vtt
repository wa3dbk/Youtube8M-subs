we've<00:01:30.509> got<00:01:30.750> six<00:01:31.049> phases<00:01:31.200> of<00:01:31.380> flight<00:01:31.500> testing

we've got six phases of flight testing

we've got six phases of flight testing
plan<00:01:32.340> for<00:01:32.759> it<00:01:32.880> starting<00:01:33.570> with<00:01:33.689> just<00:01:33.960> the<00:01:34.079> very

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
plan for it starting with just the very

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.230 
plan for it starting with just the very
basics<00:01:34.710> but<00:01:34.890> going<00:01:35.070> all<00:01:35.310> the<00:01:35.460> way<00:01:35.579> to<00:01:35.610> spin

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
basics but going all the way to spin

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.520 
basics but going all the way to spin
testing<00:01:36.710> so<00:01:37.710> that's<00:01:39.020> down<00:01:40.020> in<00:01:40.200> that<00:01:40.320> that's

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
testing so that's down in that that's

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:41.719 
testing so that's down in that that's
towards<00:01:40.860> the<00:01:40.979> end<00:01:41.100> because<00:01:41.220> that's<00:01:41.460> getting

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
towards the end because that's getting

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:44.450 
towards the end because that's getting
to<00:01:41.820> be<00:01:41.909> the<00:01:42.030> really<00:01:42.270> high-risk<00:01:42.799> testing<00:01:43.799> stuff

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
to be the really high-risk testing stuff

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.780 
to be the really high-risk testing stuff
so<00:01:44.610> we<00:01:44.700> push<00:01:44.880> that<00:01:45.060> off<00:01:45.500> until<00:01:46.500> later

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:46.790 
so we push that off until later

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:49.700 
so we push that off until later
