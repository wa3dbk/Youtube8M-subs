of chunks in there more than I thought I

00:00:45.949 --> 00:00:48.579 
of chunks in there more than I thought I
got<00:00:46.100> down<00:00:46.370> past<00:00:46.699> the<00:00:46.850> part<00:00:47.659> that's<00:00:48.140> a<00:00:48.229> great

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:48.589 
got down past the part that's a great

00:00:48.589 --> 00:00:50.950 
got down past the part that's a great
I'm<00:00:48.739> shaking<00:00:49.220> looking<00:00:50.119> for<00:00:50.269> some<00:00:50.420> new<00:00:50.510> gasket

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:50.960 
I'm shaking looking for some new gasket

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:52.149 
I'm shaking looking for some new gasket
material<00:00:51.320> before<00:00:51.500> I<00:00:51.559> put<00:00:51.710> this<00:00:51.799> thing<00:00:51.979> back

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:52.159 
material before I put this thing back

00:00:52.159 --> 00:00:56.590 
material before I put this thing back
together<00:00:52.390> and<00:00:53.390> cleaning<00:00:54.019> it<00:00:54.140> out<00:00:55.360> I've<00:00:56.360> got

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:56.600

00:01:01.869 --> 00:01:01.879 
the hopper up here you can't really see

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:02.979 
the hopper up here you can't really see
because<00:01:02.059> the<00:01:02.239> lids<00:01:02.420> closed

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:02.989

00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:06.909 
there's my leading cone into the heart

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:09.490 
there's my leading cone into the heart
just<00:01:07.909> going<00:01:08.060> to<00:01:08.119> clean<00:01:08.390> the<00:01:08.510> heavy<00:01:08.720> carbon<00:01:09.230> off

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:09.500 
just going to clean the heavy carbon off

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:14.890 
just going to clean the heavy carbon off
of<00:01:09.710> this<00:01:09.920> I<00:01:10.130> took<00:01:10.910> all<00:01:11.030> the<00:01:11.150> nozzles<00:01:11.660> out<00:01:13.270> and<00:01:14.270> I

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:14.900 
of this I took all the nozzles out and I

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:16.210 
of this I took all the nozzles out and I
took<00:01:15.110> everything<00:01:15.320> off<00:01:15.530> with<00:01:15.740> the<00:01:15.830> choke<00:01:16.040> plate

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:16.220 
took everything off with the choke plate

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:19.690 
took everything off with the choke plate
here<00:01:16.550> with<00:01:16.640> my<00:01:16.760> nozzles<00:01:17.860> okay<00:01:18.860> and<00:01:19.160> they<00:01:19.310> screw

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:19.700 
here with my nozzles okay and they screw

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:24.820 
here with my nozzles okay and they screw
in<00:01:19.910> here<00:01:21.610> okay<00:01:22.610> it's<00:01:22.760> 10<00:01:22.940> of<00:01:23.060> those<00:01:23.620> that's<00:01:24.620> a

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:24.830 
in here okay it's 10 of those that's a

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:27.340 
in here okay it's 10 of those that's a
new<00:01:25.130> choke<00:01:25.400> plate<00:01:25.600> choke<00:01:26.600> plates<00:01:26.870> are<00:01:27.050> used<00:01:27.230> to

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:27.350 
new choke plate choke plates are used to

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:29.680 
new choke plate choke plates are used to
size<00:01:27.590> your<00:01:28.160> gasifier<00:01:28.790> to<00:01:29.120> the<00:01:29.450> amount<00:01:29.630> of

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:29.690 
size your gasifier to the amount of

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:31.750 
size your gasifier to the amount of
displacement<00:01:29.990> of<00:01:30.320> your<00:01:30.470> engine<00:01:30.860> as<00:01:31.280> well<00:01:31.580> as

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:31.760 
displacement of your engine as well as

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:33.480 
displacement of your engine as well as
the<00:01:31.970> diameter<00:01:32.330> of<00:01:32.570> the<00:01:32.660> hole<00:01:32.840> in<00:01:33.020> the<00:01:33.140> nozzle

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:33.490 
the diameter of the hole in the nozzle

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:36.220 
the diameter of the hole in the nozzle
yeah<00:01:34.490> I'm<00:01:34.610> running<00:01:34.940> a<00:01:34.970> six-cylinder<00:01:35.810> engines

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:36.230 
yeah I'm running a six-cylinder engines

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:38.770 
yeah I'm running a six-cylinder engines
and<00:01:36.950> if<00:01:37.460> I<00:01:37.550> wanted<00:01:37.790> to<00:01:37.880> step<00:01:38.030> up<00:01:38.210> to<00:01:38.360> a<00:01:38.390> v8

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:38.780 
and if I wanted to step up to a v8

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:42.640 
and if I wanted to step up to a v8
I<00:01:39.080> would<00:01:39.980> drill<00:01:40.310> that<00:01:41.180> nozzle<00:01:41.900> out<00:01:42.110> all<00:01:42.500> those

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:42.650 
I would drill that nozzle out all those

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:46.360 
I would drill that nozzle out all those
nozzles<00:01:42.920> out<00:01:43.490> to<00:01:44.480> probably<00:01:45.110> a<00:01:45.230> 7/16<00:01:46.130> I<00:01:46.190> think

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:46.370 
nozzles out to probably a 7/16 I think

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:48.610 
nozzles out to probably a 7/16 I think
the<00:01:46.430> 3/8<00:01:46.820> now<00:01:47.060> and<00:01:47.450> then<00:01:48.140> I<00:01:48.170> would<00:01:48.260> go<00:01:48.470> to<00:01:48.560> that

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:48.620 
the 3/8 now and then I would go to that

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:50.850 
the 3/8 now and then I would go to that
bigger<00:01:48.920> choke<00:01:49.250> plate<00:01:49.400> which<00:01:49.729> is<00:01:49.760> bigger<00:01:50.150> than

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:50.860 
bigger choke plate which is bigger than

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:54.610 
bigger choke plate which is bigger than
the<00:01:51.860> choke<00:01:52.100> plate<00:01:52.280> this<00:01:52.580> currently<00:01:53.229> on<00:01:54.229> here

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:54.620 
the choke plate this currently on here

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:56.410 
the choke plate this currently on here
so<00:01:54.950> what<00:01:55.159> am<00:01:55.250> I<00:01:55.310> talking<00:01:55.370> about<00:01:55.729> choke<00:01:56.270> plate

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:56.420 
so what am I talking about choke plate

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:02.170 
so what am I talking about choke plate
see<00:01:57.229> how<00:01:57.290> much<00:01:57.380> bigger<00:01:57.680> this<00:01:57.920> one<00:01:58.130> is<00:02:00.970> good<00:02:01.970> 1/2

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:02.180 
see how much bigger this one is good 1/2

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:05.410 
see how much bigger this one is good 1/2
inch<00:02:02.479> in<00:02:03.170> diameter<00:02:03.760> just<00:02:04.760> about<00:02:04.880> 1/2<00:02:05.030> inch<00:02:05.330> in

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:05.420 
inch in diameter just about 1/2 inch in

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:07.360 
inch in diameter just about 1/2 inch in
diameter<00:02:05.630> bigger<00:02:06.080> which<00:02:06.830> is<00:02:06.860> a<00:02:06.979> lot<00:02:07.220> more

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:07.370 
diameter bigger which is a lot more

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:10.059 
diameter bigger which is a lot more
volume<00:02:07.760> of<00:02:08.030> air<00:02:08.390> so<00:02:09.259> you<00:02:09.619> can<00:02:09.799> make<00:02:09.920> some

00:02:10.059 --> 00:02:10.069 
volume of air so you can make some

for<00:02:56.780> I<00:02:56.989> got<00:02:57.200> to<00:02:57.290> find<00:02:57.470> some<00:02:57.620> gasket<00:02:58.040> material

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:58.400 
for I got to find some gasket material

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.009 
for I got to find some gasket material
I've<00:02:58.459> ruined<00:02:58.670> my<00:02:58.819> gaskets<00:02:59.450> taking<00:02:59.780> this<00:02:59.840> thing

00:03:00.009 --> 00:03:00.019 
I've ruined my gaskets taking this thing

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:02.650 
I've ruined my gaskets taking this thing
apart<00:03:00.290> and<00:03:00.730> they're<00:03:01.730> just<00:03:01.880> not<00:03:02.030> I'm<00:03:02.330> not<00:03:02.390> going

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:02.660 
apart and they're just not I'm not going

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:04.120 
apart and they're just not I'm not going
to<00:03:02.720> put<00:03:02.870> it<00:03:02.959> back<00:03:03.080> together<00:03:03.290> if<00:03:03.680> there's<00:03:03.860> any

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:04.130 
to put it back together if there's any

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:07.000 
to put it back together if there's any
air<00:03:04.489> being<00:03:05.360> sucked<00:03:05.660> into<00:03:05.930> this<00:03:06.140> gasifier<00:03:06.739> in

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:07.010 
air being sucked into this gasifier in

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:09.610 
air being sucked into this gasifier in
any<00:03:07.250> location<00:03:07.700> it<00:03:08.569> will<00:03:08.750> throw<00:03:09.080> off<00:03:09.290> your

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:09.620 
any location it will throw off your

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:12.190 
any location it will throw off your
carburation<00:03:10.310> so<00:03:11.239> you<00:03:11.330> want<00:03:11.660> to<00:03:11.750> make<00:03:11.870> sure<00:03:12.019> if

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:12.200 
carburation so you want to make sure if

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:14.530 
carburation so you want to make sure if
you<00:03:12.380> do<00:03:12.500> a<00:03:12.530> good<00:03:12.709> job<00:03:12.940> with<00:03:13.940> sealing<00:03:14.390> up

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:14.540 
you do a good job with sealing up

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:18.970 
you do a good job with sealing up
everything<00:03:15.260> in<00:03:15.650> the<00:03:16.580> gasifier<00:03:17.120> okay<00:03:18.080> I<00:03:18.319> guess

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:18.980 
everything in the gasifier okay I guess

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:27.759 
everything in the gasifier okay I guess
that's<00:03:19.660> that's<00:03:20.660> it<00:03:24.820> time<00:03:25.820> to<00:03:26.620> put<00:03:27.620> it<00:03:27.709> back

00:03:27.759 --> 00:03:27.769 
that's that's it time to put it back

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:28.270 
that's that's it time to put it back
together

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:28.280 
together

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:30.940 
together

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:10.880 
in good shape wasn't a lot of tar in

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:13.150 
in good shape wasn't a lot of tar in
there<00:04:11.230> not<00:04:12.230> as<00:04:12.380> much<00:04:12.530> as<00:04:12.680> I<00:04:12.769> thought<00:04:12.950> they

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:13.160 
there not as much as I thought they

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:15.250 
there not as much as I thought they
would<00:04:13.340> be<00:04:13.450> there's<00:04:14.450> a<00:04:14.510> little<00:04:14.750> bit<00:04:14.840> up<00:04:14.959> on<00:04:15.139> the

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:15.260 
would be there's a little bit up on the

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.229 
would be there's a little bit up on the
lip<00:04:15.530> but<00:04:15.769> it's<00:04:15.889> not<00:04:16.070> affecting<00:04:16.639> anything<00:04:16.850> down

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:17.239 
lip but it's not affecting anything down

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:20.920 
lip but it's not affecting anything down
below<00:04:17.630> so<00:04:17.989> anyway<00:04:18.829> ceramic<00:04:19.700> felt<00:04:20.090> gaskets<00:04:20.750> I'm
