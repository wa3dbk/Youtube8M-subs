equates<00:04:03.449> to<00:04:03.599> is<00:04:03.900> a<00:04:04.349> heck<00:04:04.620> of<00:04:04.650> a<00:04:04.799> lot<00:04:04.919> more

00:04:04.969 --> 00:04:04.979 
equates to is a heck of a lot more

00:04:04.979 --> 00:04:07.729 
equates to is a heck of a lot more
horsepower<00:04:05.280> and<00:04:05.849> a<00:04:06.180> lot<00:04:06.419> more<00:04:06.449> torque<00:04:06.989> so<00:04:07.620> when

00:04:07.729 --> 00:04:07.739 
horsepower and a lot more torque so when

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:09.319 
horsepower and a lot more torque so when
you<00:04:07.829> put<00:04:08.010> your<00:04:08.159> foot<00:04:08.340> down<00:04:08.400> you're<00:04:09.060> gonna<00:04:09.180> get

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:09.329 
you put your foot down you're gonna get

00:04:09.329 --> 00:04:11.479 
you put your foot down you're gonna get
a<00:04:09.389> lot<00:04:09.509> more<00:04:09.569> performance<00:04:10.229> out<00:04:10.290> of<00:04:10.439> this<00:04:10.560> 2.4<00:04:11.189> 4

00:04:11.479 --> 00:04:11.489 
a lot more performance out of this 2.4 4

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:15.439 
a lot more performance out of this 2.4 4
cylinder<00:04:12.799> it<00:04:13.799> looks<00:04:13.979> great<00:04:14.250> feels<00:04:15.239> great

00:04:15.439 --> 00:04:15.449 
cylinder it looks great feels great

00:04:15.449 --> 00:04:19.000 
cylinder it looks great feels great
let's<00:04:16.409> see<00:04:16.530> how<00:04:16.620> she<00:04:16.709> drives

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:19.010 
let's see how she drives

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:21.580 
let's see how she drives
so<00:04:20.000> one<00:04:20.120> of<00:04:20.150> the<00:04:20.270> key<00:04:20.420> points<00:04:20.810> that<00:04:21.320> I'd<00:04:21.410> like

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:21.590 
so one of the key points that I'd like

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:24.460 
so one of the key points that I'd like
to<00:04:21.680> point<00:04:21.830> out<00:04:22.010> about<00:04:22.130> the<00:04:22.400> Kia<00:04:22.790> Optima<00:04:23.270> is<00:04:24.260> the

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:24.470 
to point out about the Kia Optima is the

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:27.490 
to point out about the Kia Optima is the
fact<00:04:24.650> that<00:04:24.800> before<00:04:25.310> Kia<00:04:26.150> had<00:04:26.500> something

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:27.500 
fact that before Kia had something

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:29.230 
fact that before Kia had something
called<00:04:27.680> an<00:04:27.800> eco<00:04:28.100> Drive<00:04:28.400> which<00:04:28.850> was<00:04:28.970> just<00:04:29.150> a

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:29.240 
called an eco Drive which was just a

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:31.570 
called an eco Drive which was just a
reminder<00:04:30.200> system<00:04:30.770> that<00:04:31.100> would<00:04:31.190> let<00:04:31.340> you<00:04:31.460> know

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:31.580 
reminder system that would let you know

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:33.010 
reminder system that would let you know
that<00:04:31.730> you<00:04:31.820> were<00:04:31.910> getting<00:04:32.060> optimized<00:04:32.750> fuel

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:33.020 
that you were getting optimized fuel

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:36.010 
that you were getting optimized fuel
economy<00:04:33.370> in<00:04:34.370> this<00:04:34.640> case<00:04:34.880> they<00:04:35.570> actually<00:04:35.870> have

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:36.020 
economy in this case they actually have

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:38.710 
economy in this case they actually have
actually<00:04:36.560> have<00:04:36.680> a<00:04:36.710> system<00:04:37.010> called<00:04:37.640> active<00:04:38.360> eco

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:38.720 
actually have a system called active eco

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:41.470 
actually have a system called active eco
Drive<00:04:38.990> so<00:04:39.860> if<00:04:40.010> I<00:04:40.100> were<00:04:40.220> to<00:04:40.340> activate<00:04:40.820> it<00:04:40.970> while

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:41.480 
Drive so if I were to activate it while

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:44.620 
Drive so if I were to activate it while
driving<00:04:41.810> it<00:04:42.650> will<00:04:43.220> improve<00:04:44.180> my<00:04:44.240> fuel

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:44.630 
driving it will improve my fuel

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:47.800 
driving it will improve my fuel
consumption<00:04:45.170> by<00:04:45.590> almost<00:04:45.860> 10<00:04:46.130> percent<00:04:46.810> now

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:47.810 
consumption by almost 10 percent now

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:49.000 
consumption by almost 10 percent now
you're<00:04:47.930> probably<00:04:48.050> thinking<00:04:48.230> that<00:04:48.890> will

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:49.010 
you're probably thinking that will

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:51.340 
you're probably thinking that will
affect<00:04:49.280> my<00:04:49.340> performance<00:04:49.810> but<00:04:50.810> what<00:04:51.020> key<00:04:51.200> is

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:51.350 
affect my performance but what key is

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:53.680 
affect my performance but what key is
done<00:04:51.560> is<00:04:52.010> they've<00:04:52.310> made<00:04:52.340> sure<00:04:52.790> that<00:04:53.390> it<00:04:53.510> won't

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:53.690 
done is they've made sure that it won't

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:55.240 
done is they've made sure that it won't
affect<00:04:53.930> your<00:04:54.020> performance<00:04:54.200> more<00:04:54.770> than<00:04:54.800> two<00:04:55.100> or

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:55.250 
affect your performance more than two or

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:57.460 
affect your performance more than two or
three<00:04:55.460> percent<00:04:55.610> so<00:04:56.570> you're<00:04:56.990> actually<00:04:57.140> saving

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:57.470 
three percent so you're actually saving

00:04:57.470 --> 00:04:59.320 
three percent so you're actually saving
fuel<00:04:58.010> and<00:04:58.280> you're<00:04:58.790> still<00:04:59.030> getting<00:04:59.180> the

00:04:59.320 --> 00:04:59.330 
fuel and you're still getting the

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:00.940 
fuel and you're still getting the
performance<00:04:59.870> that<00:04:59.930> you<00:05:00.110> bought<00:05:00.290> this<00:05:00.470> car<00:05:00.530> for

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:00.950 
performance that you bought this car for

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:03.160 
performance that you bought this car for
so<00:05:01.760> a<00:05:01.790> really<00:05:02.000> neat<00:05:02.150> system<00:05:02.360> it<00:05:02.930> will

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:03.170 
so a really neat system it will

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:05.230 
so a really neat system it will
deactivate<00:05:03.440> under<00:05:04.280> any<00:05:04.700> emergency

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:05.240 
deactivate under any emergency

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:07.300 
deactivate under any emergency
situations<00:05:05.900> of<00:05:06.080> course<00:05:06.260> so<00:05:06.800> if<00:05:06.920> you<00:05:07.010> put<00:05:07.220> your

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:07.310 
situations of course so if you put your

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:09.220 
situations of course so if you put your
foot<00:05:07.430> down<00:05:07.490> on<00:05:07.640> the<00:05:07.820> gas<00:05:07.970> immediately<00:05:08.390> it'll

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:09.230 
foot down on the gas immediately it'll

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:10.840 
foot down on the gas immediately it'll
shut<00:05:09.380> the<00:05:09.530> system<00:05:09.710> off<00:05:10.010> to<00:05:10.310> make<00:05:10.640> sure<00:05:10.760> that

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:10.850 
shut the system off to make sure that

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:12.570 
shut the system off to make sure that
you're<00:05:10.970> getting<00:05:11.060> optimized<00:05:11.720> performance

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:12.580 
you're getting optimized performance

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:16.480 
you're getting optimized performance
other<00:05:13.580> key<00:05:13.880> notes<00:05:14.120> about<00:05:14.420> the<00:05:14.600> Optima<00:05:15.050> all<00:05:15.650> of

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:16.490 
other key notes about the Optima all of

other key notes about the Optima all of
the<00:05:16.640> models<00:05:17.000> not<00:05:17.540> just<00:05:17.600> the<00:05:17.900> luxury<00:05:18.230> ones<00:05:18.470> but

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:19.010 
the models not just the luxury ones but

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:21.850 
the models not just the luxury ones but
all<00:05:19.190> of<00:05:19.460> them<00:05:19.670> come<00:05:20.270> with<00:05:20.480> the<00:05:20.780> active<00:05:21.440> dynamic

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:21.860 
all of them come with the active dynamic

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:25.140 
all of them come with the active dynamic
damper<00:05:22.700> system<00:05:23.230> so<00:05:24.230> what<00:05:24.410> does<00:05:24.740> that<00:05:24.770> mean

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:25.150 
damper system so what does that mean

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:28.630 
damper system so what does that mean
basically<00:05:26.410> like<00:05:27.410> the<00:05:27.530> Sportage<00:05:28.040> on<00:05:28.340> some<00:05:28.580> of

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:28.640 
basically like the Sportage on some of

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:31.510 
basically like the Sportage on some of
the<00:05:28.730> higher<00:05:28.880> models<00:05:29.300> it<00:05:29.810> has<00:05:30.520> suspensions

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:31.520 
the higher models it has suspensions

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:33.760 
the higher models it has suspensions
that<00:05:32.150> will<00:05:32.300> adjust<00:05:32.690> how<00:05:33.020> the<00:05:33.080> fluid<00:05:33.410> flows

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:33.770 
that will adjust how the fluid flows

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:36.340 
that will adjust how the fluid flows
around<00:05:34.300> so<00:05:35.300> you're<00:05:35.420> getting<00:05:35.660> a<00:05:35.720> smoother<00:05:36.170> ride

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:36.350 
around so you're getting a smoother ride

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:39.250 
around so you're getting a smoother ride
that<00:05:37.220> will<00:05:37.340> actually<00:05:37.700> tighten<00:05:38.000> based<00:05:38.750> on<00:05:38.990> how

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:39.260 
that will actually tighten based on how

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:42.010 
that will actually tighten based on how
you're<00:05:39.440> driving<00:05:40.330> so<00:05:41.330> the<00:05:41.450> feedback<00:05:41.660> that<00:05:41.960> the

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:42.020 
you're driving so the feedback that the

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:44.560 
you're driving so the feedback that the
driver<00:05:42.260> gets<00:05:42.560> is<00:05:43.010> a<00:05:43.070> smooth<00:05:43.520> ride<00:05:43.820> in<00:05:44.090> the

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:44.570 
driver gets is a smooth ride in the

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:46.450 
driver gets is a smooth ride in the
corners<00:05:44.930> though<00:05:45.110> it<00:05:45.410> braces<00:05:45.770> against<00:05:46.280> body

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:46.460 
corners though it braces against body

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:52.200 
corners though it braces against body
roll<00:05:46.730> really<00:05:47.480> slick<00:05:48.550> will<00:05:49.550> pop<00:05:49.730> that<00:05:49.940> open

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:52.210 

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:55.180 

actually<00:05:53.210> you<00:05:53.270> know<00:05:53.360> what<00:05:53.800> let's<00:05:54.800> let<00:05:54.920> the<00:05:55.010> Sun

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:55.190 
actually you know what let's let the Sun

00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:57.210 
actually you know what let's let the Sun
in

00:05:57.210 --> 00:05:57.220 
in

00:05:57.220 --> 00:05:59.400 
in
so<00:05:57.850> one<00:05:58.000> of<00:05:58.030> the<00:05:58.180> engine<00:05:58.480> options<00:05:58.870> in<00:05:59.170> this

00:05:59.400 --> 00:05:59.410 
so one of the engine options in this

00:05:59.410 --> 00:06:04.860 
so one of the engine options in this
