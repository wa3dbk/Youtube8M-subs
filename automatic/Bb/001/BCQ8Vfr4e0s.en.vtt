 I hope you're fine just like 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.000
 me it would be great player finds himself 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.890
 for the presentation of a new word 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.710
 once again our world is there 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.420
 windows you've already seen on is rage 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.540
 today his presentation of rabies 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.879
 freaking guys so here are some 

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:49.140
 subscribers which concerns an area already the 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.420
 world is tearing away for what will be kept by 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.920
 in rabies or other so that's yes 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.870
 it's done it's a player that's 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.850
 in the black ops 2 that's why there is 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.000
 a gameplay because of them worried 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.970
 this as under the eyes as long as 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.049
 media wanted to comment before this dilemma 

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:05.580
 I demand the eyes I said I will take 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.930
 to falbalas because it's going to have everything 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.310
 seems to turn his head so much that 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.810
 was going fast guys you come this 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.369
 was worth 1,300 to their poles for 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.049
 desertion sarr major orientations of the 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:15.000
 blackhawk of good when one is 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:16.979
 moderately dense and gameplay in 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.799
 four minutes it 65 gulfstream iv 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:22.380
 mine really on purpose there is also a 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:25.470
 series of 28 wholesale a nuclear fact 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:27.360
 the two of our stones is that 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.740
 does unfortunately it happens and she has 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.060
 taken more clear equivalent 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.280
 so it will not be for this time 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.110
 by then full of quad gameplay 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.820
 nuclear and that made heavy I aÃ¯ 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:39.000
 clearly and see his chain he has a thousand 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:41.660
 are really subscribed a guy in niger 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.920
 meaning so here it is a little my 

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:45.630
 teammate years as we can say with 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.480
 he's going to squat the multi- team 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:50.909
 each time a theme that is certain 

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:52.409
 was playing heavy on Sundays 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:55.040
 have six hours in a row helmet has 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:57.180
 redeemed 1 94 as big hard tries 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:59.520
 but really I'm happy to 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:01.140
 new in the team team when we 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.060
 was together in the dream for those 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.500
 who know so here are the guys 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.820
 severely in laying it was 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:09.239
 responsible to the head you can departure 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:12.299
 would end these comments from 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:13.650
 lightning nervously never stops those 

00:02:12.299 --> 00:02:16.590
 who say it's a dream that's useful to 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:18.330
 2.52 ratio is maybe the little info 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:20.610
 it's always a little thing it is 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:22.049
 severe from to masters division on bed 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:23.400
 hospital 

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:24.810
 so that's how you know there are the 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.099
 axes with 9 billion depend 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:28.349
 now it is I think the most 

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:30.209
 threatened any point so really to play 

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:34.200
 his life betrayed him in common or the piles 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:35.400
 get to that so here it is on ps3 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.330
 so if you want to add do not hesitate 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.499
 I do not know that right now he wants 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:39.209
 try to have 300 that he has what 

00:02:37.499 --> 00:02:40.620
 nuclear it needs support and 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:42.840
 obviously to arrive at scores 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:44.609
 so do not hesitate to add it to 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:46.379
 tell him I'm a shy starter 

00:02:44.609 --> 00:02:48.209
 start of play really helped to try 

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:50.430
 of gameplay it will make him so happy to 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:52.049
 him to me and especially that the wall 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:52.950
 unfair opposes to work it's going 

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:53.489
 to please everyone wants 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:56.069
 not lie to each other 

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:58.260
 so here and there we will come and say that the 

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:59.700
 question of the day that of the multihull on 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.919
 the rage it's true that it's a bit early 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:03.529
 in February one of them I comment on 

00:03:01.919 --> 00:03:06.419
 fights of gameplay will not run away 

00:03:03.529 --> 00:03:08.189
 so that's why not you 

00:03:06.419 --> 00:03:10.379
 put old code like you kevin 

00:03:08.189 --> 00:03:16.680
 do not give up a good move we will not 

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:18.840
 you own ghost people even from 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:21.989
 gulf few people hurt and it gives 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:22.349
 so hours when we go we propose 

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:24.419
 itunes 

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:26.249
 the three lakes to the majority videos 

00:03:24.419 --> 00:03:29.279
 always i want to see apart obviously 

00:03:26.249 --> 00:03:30.840
 majority but with blackhawk 2 kim w3 

00:03:29.279 --> 00:03:32.669
 of the black ops one like that in the demo 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:35.790
 who is one of all see if not 

00:03:32.669 --> 00:03:36.930
 the best player on blackhawks 1 so 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:38.249
 here we will not miss the big minds 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:39.569
 especially old trekking codes 

00:03:38.249 --> 00:03:41.849
 to make a return to the sources that 

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:43.680
 we fly a little nostalgic and I 

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:46.769
 suffers I appreciate it maybe will be a 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:49.819
 little calmed but with hates who 

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:52.829
 count on rabies it 's reboot 

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:54.510

00:03:52.829 --> 00:03:56.849
 not drawn the charity of years yet a 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:58.409
