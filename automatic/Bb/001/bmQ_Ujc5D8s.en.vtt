and ro exciting gameplay commentary I

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:12.560 
and ro exciting gameplay commentary I
think<00:00:11.250> it's<00:00:11.400> only<00:00:11.550> fair<00:00:12.030> that<00:00:12.090> you<00:00:12.389> should

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
think it's only fair that you should

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:14.870 
think it's only fair that you should
know<00:00:12.929> something<00:00:13.259> so<00:00:14.070> I<00:00:14.099> don't<00:00:14.519> know<00:00:14.639> whether

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
know something so I don't know whether

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:16.490 
know something so I don't know whether
you<00:00:15.089> know<00:00:15.299> this<00:00:15.480> or<00:00:15.660> not<00:00:15.719> but<00:00:15.870> if<00:00:16.170> you<00:00:16.289> don't

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
you know this or not but if you don't

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.170 
you know this or not but if you don't
know<00:00:16.650> this<00:00:16.830> already<00:00:17.100> then<00:00:17.430> you<00:00:17.880> probably

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
know this already then you probably

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.810 
know this already then you probably
should<00:00:18.570> but<00:00:19.260> so<00:00:19.470> basically<00:00:20.160> I<00:00:20.369> am<00:00:20.609> the<00:00:20.789> best

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
should but so basically I am the best
