00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:25.039 
for Lego I went to high school and I

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:27.259 
for Lego I went to high school and I
originally<00:00:26.039> wanted<00:00:26.160> to<00:00:26.369> be<00:00:26.490> an<00:00:26.580> architect<00:00:26.789> but

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
never got into the school so I got to

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:32.269 
never got into the school so I got to

00:00:34.769 --> 00:00:37.549 
of years and applied for the job here at
Lego<00:00:35.100> so<00:00:35.820> that's<00:00:36.420> how<00:00:36.570> I<00:00:36.600> ended<00:00:36.720> up<00:00:36.989> here<00:00:37.050> my

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
Lego so that's how I ended up here my

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:39.110 
Lego so that's how I ended up here my
first<00:00:37.830> legal<00:00:38.040> model<00:00:38.430> was<00:00:38.670> the<00:00:38.850> Star<00:00:39.089> Wars

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
first legal model was the Star Wars

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.869 
first legal model was the Star Wars
ultimate<00:00:39.989> collector<00:00:40.470> x-wing<00:00:41.159> fighter<00:00:41.430> which

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
ultimate collector x-wing fighter which

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:43.579 
ultimate collector x-wing fighter which
at<00:00:42.089> that<00:00:42.269> time<00:00:42.510> also<00:00:42.809> was<00:00:43.110> the<00:00:43.260> biggest

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:43.589 
at that time also was the biggest

00:00:43.589 --> 00:00:45.410 
at that time also was the biggest
biggest<00:00:44.070> legal<00:00:44.339> model<00:00:44.670> this<00:00:45.150> is<00:00:45.390> the

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
biggest legal model this is the

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.210 
biggest legal model this is the
brand-new<00:00:46.140> 2012

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:47.220 
brand-new 2012

brand-new 2012
Star<00:00:47.909> Wars<00:00:48.119> b-wing<00:00:48.629> Starfighter<00:00:49.170> and<00:00:49.940> when<00:00:50.940> I

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:50.970 
Star Wars b-wing Starfighter and when I

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:52.939 
Star Wars b-wing Starfighter and when I
got<00:00:51.239> the<00:00:51.390> assignment<00:00:51.780> to<00:00:52.199> do<00:00:52.350> this<00:00:52.500> model<00:00:52.830> I

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
got the assignment to do this model I

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.030 
got the assignment to do this model I
started<00:00:53.699> doing<00:00:54.000> a<00:00:54.119> lot<00:00:54.420> of<00:00:54.449> research<00:00:54.659> and<00:00:55.260> I

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:56.040 
started doing a lot of research and I

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:58.520 
started doing a lot of research and I
had<00:00:56.879> to<00:00:57.000> define<00:00:57.299> a<00:00:57.360> scale<00:00:57.750> of<00:00:58.049> this<00:00:58.170> model

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
had to define a scale of this model

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.229 
had to define a scale of this model
since<00:00:58.830> there's<00:00:59.070> no<00:00:59.250> minifigures<00:00:59.850> in<00:01:00.000> it<00:01:00.119> the

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
since there's no minifigures in it the

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.679 
since there's no minifigures in it the
scale<00:01:00.479> was<00:01:00.750> up<00:01:01.619> to<00:01:01.860> me<00:01:02.010> so<00:01:02.670> I<00:01:02.699> did<00:01:03.420> a<00:01:03.449> lot<00:01:03.659> of

00:01:03.679 --> 00:01:03.689 
scale was up to me so I did a lot of

00:01:03.689 --> 00:01:05.990 
scale was up to me so I did a lot of
research<00:01:03.869> in<00:01:04.290> our<00:01:04.470> element<00:01:04.860> portfolio<00:01:05.610> and

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
research in our element portfolio and

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.090 
research in our element portfolio and
had<00:01:06.630> to<00:01:06.780> find<00:01:06.990> some<00:01:07.229> elements<00:01:07.470> that<00:01:07.710> would<00:01:08.040> be

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
had to find some elements that would be

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.190 
had to find some elements that would be
appropriate<00:01:08.880> for<00:01:09.000> this<00:01:09.210> one<00:01:09.450> the<00:01:09.990> biggest

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
appropriate for this one the biggest

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.859 
appropriate for this one the biggest
challenge<00:01:10.619> was<00:01:10.740> to<00:01:10.890> do<00:01:11.040> the<00:01:11.159> cockpit<00:01:11.520> part

00:01:11.859 --> 00:01:11.869 
challenge was to do the cockpit part

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:14.480 
challenge was to do the cockpit part
because<00:01:12.869> it's<00:01:13.049> round<00:01:13.230> and<00:01:13.500> we<00:01:14.130> don't<00:01:14.340> have

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
because it's round and we don't have

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.470 
because it's round and we don't have
that<00:01:14.550> many<00:01:14.910> round<00:01:15.480> elements<00:01:16.130> so<00:01:17.130> I<00:01:17.520> found<00:01:17.970> two

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:18.480 
that many round elements so I found two

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:20.810 
that many round elements so I found two
motorcycle<00:01:19.350> wheels<00:01:19.530> and<00:01:20.040> some<00:01:20.610> old

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
motorcycle wheels and some old

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.700 
motorcycle wheels and some old
caterpillar<00:01:21.240> tracks<00:01:21.600> and<00:01:22.110> some<00:01:22.320> power-

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
caterpillar tracks and some power-

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.340 
caterpillar tracks and some power-
wheels<00:01:23.100> that<00:01:23.460> would<00:01:23.640> would<00:01:24.510> be<00:01:24.540> appropriate<00:01:25.050> I

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
wheels that would would be appropriate I

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.149 
wheels that would would be appropriate I
also<00:01:26.130> found<00:01:26.430> this<00:01:26.580> canopy<00:01:27.120> and<00:01:27.470> then<00:01:28.470> that

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
also found this canopy and then that

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:32.450 
also found this canopy and then that
kind<00:01:29.670> of<00:01:29.760> defined<00:01:30.150> the<00:01:30.300> scale<00:01:30.570> and<00:01:30.890> the<00:01:31.890> rest<00:01:32.100> I

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
kind of defined the scale and the rest I

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.640 
kind of defined the scale and the rest I
also<00:01:33.210> had<00:01:33.420> to<00:01:33.540> find<00:01:33.720> elements<00:01:34.080> that<00:01:34.170> would<00:01:34.290> be

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
also had to find elements that would be

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.580 
also had to find elements that would be
appropriate<00:01:35.010> for<00:01:35.630> but<00:01:36.630> we<00:01:36.810> do<00:01:37.170> have<00:01:37.380> a<00:01:37.409> lot<00:01:37.560> of

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
appropriate for but we do have a lot of

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.350 
appropriate for but we do have a lot of
angle<00:01:37.979> plates<00:01:38.190> in<00:01:38.580> different<00:01:38.940> angles<00:01:39.060> and

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
angle plates in different angles and

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.719 
angle plates in different angles and
stuff<00:01:39.450> so<00:01:40.050> that<00:01:40.979> wasn't<00:01:41.280> that<00:01:41.310> hard

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
stuff so that wasn't that hard

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.810 
stuff so that wasn't that hard
these<00:01:42.300> caterpillar<00:01:42.810> tracks<00:01:43.050> up<00:01:43.229> here<00:01:43.290> are

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:43.820 
these caterpillar tracks up here are

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:46.880 
these caterpillar tracks up here are
originally<00:01:44.820> from<00:01:44.850> a<00:01:45.180> 1970s<00:01:45.930> technic

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
originally from a 1970s technic

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.890 
originally from a 1970s technic
bulldozer<00:01:47.280> and<00:01:47.580> have<00:01:48.180> never<00:01:48.510> been<00:01:48.720> produced

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:48.900 
bulldozer and have never been produced

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:50.750 
bulldozer and have never been produced
in<00:01:49.170> other<00:01:49.320> colors<00:01:49.650> than<00:01:49.800> black<00:01:50.010> but<00:01:50.520> in<00:01:50.640> this

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:50.760 
in other colors than black but in this

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:52.399 
in other colors than black but in this
model<00:01:51.090> they<00:01:51.180> are<00:01:51.210> featured<00:01:51.630> in<00:01:51.720> light<00:01:51.960> gray<00:01:52.200> so

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
model they are featured in light gray so

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.469 
model they are featured in light gray so
I<00:01:53.010> guess<00:01:53.340> it<00:01:53.520> will<00:01:53.580> be<00:01:53.640> really<00:01:54.060> unique<00:01:54.240> for

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
I guess it will be really unique for

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.660 
I guess it will be really unique for
this<00:01:54.600> model<00:01:54.840> this<00:01:55.320> model<00:01:55.740> doesn't<00:01:56.310> have<00:01:56.520> that

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
this model this model doesn't have that

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.630 
this model this model doesn't have that
big<00:01:57.380> part<00:01:58.380> of<00:01:58.560> the<00:01:58.680> movies<00:01:59.010> so<00:01:59.280> it<00:01:59.340> doesn't

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
big part of the movies so it doesn't

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.580 
big part of the movies so it doesn't
have<00:01:59.729> that<00:01:59.760> many<00:02:00.030> functions<00:02:00.600> but<00:02:00.810> it<00:02:01.020> has

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
have that many functions but it has

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.980 
have that many functions but it has
foldable<00:02:02.130> wings<00:02:02.370> and<00:02:02.790> a<00:02:03.060> rotating<00:02:03.450> cockpit

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
foldable wings and a rotating cockpit

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:11.110 
foldable wings and a rotating cockpit
and<00:02:06.950> when<00:02:07.950> the<00:02:08.220> Starfighter<00:02:08.819> flies<00:02:09.349> in<00:02:10.349> space

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:11.120 
and when the Starfighter flies in space

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:15.280 
and when the Starfighter flies in space
the<00:02:12.120> cockpit<00:02:12.510> will<00:02:12.690> rotate<00:02:12.870> like<00:02:13.110> this<00:02:13.459> and

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290 
the cockpit will rotate like this and

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:18.130 
the cockpit will rotate like this and
when<00:02:16.290> it's<00:02:16.440> landing

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:18.140 
when it's landing

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:21.850 
when it's landing
in<00:02:18.410> two<00:02:18.560> Scotties<00:02:18.860> vulnerable<00:02:19.550> wings<00:02:20.830> so<00:02:21.830> it

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:21.860 
in two Scotties vulnerable wings so it

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:26.770 
in two Scotties vulnerable wings so it
would<00:02:22.100> land<00:02:22.280> like<00:02:22.490> this<00:02:25.060> it's<00:02:26.060> also<00:02:26.270> got<00:02:26.540> a<00:02:26.570> lot

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:26.780 
would land like this it's also got a lot

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:31.240 
would land like this it's also got a lot
of<00:02:26.900> guns<00:02:27.140> and<00:02:27.700> cannons<00:02:29.860> but<00:02:30.860> they<00:02:31.040> are<00:02:31.100> not

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:31.250 
of guns and cannons but they are not

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:33.370 
of guns and cannons but they are not
non-functional<00:02:32.120> in<00:02:32.300> this<00:02:32.450> model<00:02:32.780> so<00:02:33.080> they're

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:33.380 
non-functional in this model so they're

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:35.920 
non-functional in this model so they're
just<00:02:33.620> for<00:02:33.770> display<00:02:33.970> my<00:02:34.970> favorite<00:02:35.450> element<00:02:35.810> in

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:35.930 
just for display my favorite element in

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:37.870 
just for display my favorite element in
this<00:02:36.050> model<00:02:36.440> and<00:02:36.590> the<00:02:36.950> element<00:02:37.220> that<00:02:37.460> actually

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:37.880 
this model and the element that actually

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:40.960 
this model and the element that actually
made<00:02:38.090> it<00:02:38.980> possible<00:02:39.980> to<00:02:40.220> build<00:02:40.520> this<00:02:40.610> model<00:02:40.790> in

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:40.970 
made it possible to build this model in

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:44.130 
made it possible to build this model in
the<00:02:41.000> way<00:02:41.210> I<00:02:41.240> did<00:02:41.540> is<00:02:41.720> this<00:02:42.220> brand-new<00:02:43.220> 2<00:02:43.730> by<00:02:43.910> 2

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:44.140 
the way I did is this brand-new 2 by 2

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:46.560 
the way I did is this brand-new 2 by 2
angle<00:02:45.140> plate<00:02:45.170> which<00:02:45.650> starts<00:02:46.010> on<00:02:46.160> the<00:02:46.280> side

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:46.570 
angle plate which starts on the side

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:51.310 
angle plate which starts on the side
which<00:02:47.570> allows<00:02:47.600> me<00:02:48.170> to<00:02:48.320> build<00:02:48.530> a<00:02:49.270> in<00:02:50.270> the<00:02:51.200> way<00:02:51.290> I

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:51.320 
which allows me to build a in the way I

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:55.870 
which allows me to build a in the way I
do<00:02:51.470> here<00:02:52.420> so<00:02:53.420> I<00:02:53.780> have<00:02:54.200> a<00:02:54.440> lot<00:02:54.770> of<00:02:54.800> them<00:02:55.010> all<00:02:55.580> the

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:55.880 
do here so I have a lot of them all the

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:57.280 
do here so I have a lot of them all the
way<00:02:55.970> down<00:02:56.209> the<00:02:56.720> spine

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:57.290 
way down the spine

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:59.800 
way down the spine
you<00:02:57.440> could<00:02:57.620> you<00:02:57.980> could<00:02:58.010> say<00:02:58.390> sits<00:02:59.390> like<00:02:59.570> this

00:02:59.800 --> 00:02:59.810 
you could you could say sits like this

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:03.640 
you could you could say sits like this
and<00:03:00.910> these<00:03:01.910> two<00:03:02.090> parts<00:03:02.510> left<00:03:03.320> and<00:03:03.530> right

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:03.650 
and these two parts left and right

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:06.610 
and these two parts left and right
actually<00:03:04.360> totally<00:03:05.360> the<00:03:05.720> same<00:03:05.930> just<00:03:06.260> mirrored

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:06.620 
actually totally the same just mirrored

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:08.920 
actually totally the same just mirrored
and<00:03:06.800> the<00:03:07.730> way<00:03:07.850> the<00:03:07.910> model<00:03:08.180> is<00:03:08.270> built<00:03:08.420> is<00:03:08.660> I<00:03:08.690> just

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:08.930 
and the way the model is built is I just

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:12.280 
and the way the model is built is I just
placed<00:03:09.410> them<00:03:09.590> together<00:03:09.740> like<00:03:10.640> this<00:03:11.200> then<00:03:12.200> I

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:12.290 
placed them together like this then I

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:14.740 
placed them together like this then I
have<00:03:12.470> a<00:03:12.500> lot<00:03:12.709> of<00:03:12.830> parts<00:03:13.160> where<00:03:14.030> I<00:03:14.090> use<00:03:14.390> these

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:14.750 
have a lot of parts where I use these

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:18.640 
have a lot of parts where I use these
special<00:03:15.140> studs<00:03:15.590> these<00:03:16.430> bricks<00:03:17.170> all<00:03:18.170> the<00:03:18.530> way

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:18.650 
special studs these bricks all the way

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:21.610 
special studs these bricks all the way
up<00:03:18.800> here<00:03:19.100> to<00:03:20.000> keep<00:03:20.900> them<00:03:21.080> together<00:03:21.260> and

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:21.620 
up here to keep them together and

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:23.500 
up here to keep them together and
actually<00:03:22.459> makes<00:03:22.700> a<00:03:22.820> really<00:03:23.030> really<00:03:23.300> stable

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:23.510 
actually makes a really really stable

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:32.080 
actually makes a really really stable
model<00:03:24.489> so<00:03:25.489> for<00:03:26.300> this<00:03:26.530> and<00:03:28.540> a<00:03:29.540> little<00:03:31.090> extra

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:32.090 
model so for this and a little extra

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:35.229 
model so for this and a little extra
parts<00:03:32.510> here<00:03:33.080> and<00:03:33.110> there<00:03:33.880> makes<00:03:34.880> the<00:03:35.060> whole

00:03:35.229 --> 00:03:35.239 
parts here and there makes the whole

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:37.960 
parts here and there makes the whole
wing<00:03:35.450> and<00:03:36.310> basically<00:03:37.310> the<00:03:37.459> whole<00:03:37.489> model<00:03:37.880> is

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:37.970 
wing and basically the whole model is

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:41.440 
wing and basically the whole model is
built<00:03:39.190> mirrored<00:03:40.190> and<00:03:40.400> then<00:03:40.970> just<00:03:41.269> put

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:41.450 
built mirrored and then just put

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:43.900 
built mirrored and then just put
together<00:03:41.739> so<00:03:42.739> what<00:03:42.950> I<00:03:42.980> can<00:03:43.070> do<00:03:43.280> now<00:03:43.489> is<00:03:43.519> take

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:43.910 
together so what I can do now is take

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:45.790 
together so what I can do now is take
the<00:03:44.330> top<00:03:44.510> part<00:03:44.720> which<00:03:45.019> is<00:03:45.170> built<00:03:45.380> in<00:03:45.500> the<00:03:45.590> same

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:45.800 
the top part which is built in the same

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:51.550 
the top part which is built in the same
way<00:03:47.050> and<00:03:48.050> fit<00:03:48.380> them<00:03:48.500> together<00:03:50.260> click<00:03:51.260> on<00:03:51.410> the

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:51.560 
way and fit them together click on the

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:58.259 
way and fit them together click on the
wings

00:03:58.259 --> 00:03:58.269 

00:03:58.269 --> 00:04:04.660 

and<00:03:59.499> the<00:04:00.969> lower<00:04:01.969> gun<00:04:02.379> again<00:04:03.379> and<00:04:03.650> there<00:04:04.609> you

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:04.670 
and the lower gun again and there you

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:07.180 
and the lower gun again and there you
have<00:04:04.730> the<00:04:04.849> model
