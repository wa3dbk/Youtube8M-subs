the<00:00:16.890> spike<00:00:17.160> I<00:00:17.400> think<00:00:17.580> you<00:00:17.699> probably<00:00:17.850> could

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
the spike I think you probably could

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.099 
the spike I think you probably could
have<00:00:18.240> figured<00:00:18.420> that<00:00:18.570> on<00:00:18.810> your<00:00:19.020> own<00:00:20.359> but<00:00:21.359> you

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
have figured that on your own but you

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:23.810 
have figured that on your own but you
can<00:00:22.260> just<00:00:22.289> beat<00:00:22.650> the<00:00:22.680> levels<00:00:23.160> and<00:00:23.400> then<00:00:23.670> you

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
can just beat the levels and then you

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.599 
can just beat the levels and then you
can<00:00:24.000> be<00:00:24.090> the<00:00:24.240> speedrun<00:00:24.869> trihard<00:00:25.230> and<00:00:25.949> compete

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:10.780 
normally there's not a reason to try to
