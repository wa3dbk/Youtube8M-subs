00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.070
 better everyone knows in so 

00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:04.879
 today we find ourselves a new 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:07.259
 video for the presentation of the 

00:00:04.879 --> 00:00:09.240
 new version 1 5 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:11.040
 go we find ourselves in the new 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:16.219
 So for the new novelty is that 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:16.219
 that we can put several layers of 

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:26.980
 2 

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:26.980
 simply snow this 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:31.840
 no 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:34.090
 let's meet for a second 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:36.820
 novelty second fault and this is the 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:38.890
 marble Morocco that kraft like this 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:41.460
 with those below we can make 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:41.460
 new things 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:48.560
 very sure 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.560
 new plates 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:56.170
 that's how these are what gives 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:01:00.159
 this is the first one is that of hp 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:02.199
 kraft patrol that's the marble to 

00:01:00.159 --> 00:01:05.120
 the natural state offenders nether 

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:08.870
 the desert 

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:10.100
 the nether who fasted hours in all 

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:15.260
 it gives hours now but 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:18.120
 will have to bother me generate new and 

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:22.350
 here we are on a third alongside 

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:24.900
 stuff like that 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:27.170
 it will be done like these and it gives 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.170
 it 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:32.230
 in fact it makes it nice enough 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:32.230
 system 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:39.590
 it avoids us censors 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:40.460
 this is it can allow us to 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:43.460
 do a lot of things 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:45.410
 so go find yourself for the 14th 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:48.890
 here we are will fourth novelty that 

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:52.670
 is finally available a navarro hopper 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:54.550
 say sponsors and who is kraft like 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:57.140
 these and that allows simply to 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:59.150
 ash to the world port that allows everything 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:08.209
 simply trophies the systems do not 

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:10.850
 never stop but here it does not have to 

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:14.440
 the nipple here it is on the 4th novelty 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:19.730
 which will simply allow us 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:22.540
 2-2 to be able to put systems and 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:26.540
 they are going to be directly inspired a 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:31.100
 sucked is directly connected true in 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:31.660
 the truck yesterday so so how that 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:34.290
 script 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:39.170
 simply may 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:42.020
 atx is like that 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:45.200
 and here we have our autpert note hopper 

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:48.349
 who is our o'byrne 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:50.090
 so let's go on the fifth so 

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:54.140
 here we are again on the sixth 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:55.370
 a role on the 6th 5th invention which 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:57.350
 is the blog of mrs ashton 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:03:00.020
 the ralston block that's just 

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:02.780
 beautiful and that will allow us to 

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:04.730
 make a lot of votes but for now 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:07.910
 I did not really prove a great 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:10.670
 utility to this block despite I sure 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:13.430
 that there is plenty to find a system 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:16.190
 with and this system I will show you 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:19.730
 well you late and so here we are again and 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:20.900
 there we have the iron plate the plate of 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:24.290
 iron that will allow us all 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:26.989
 just who's just going 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:28.880
 allow us to be here with 

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:31.160
 power systems turn on some 

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:33.260
 thing and that there that cost a little 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:36.459
 more expensive so had simply is 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:36.459
 the same thing here 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:43.310
 you need a certain number of items ah no 

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:46.400
 but not at the cobo I know more had to be 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:50.720
 changed so here is simply 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:54.730
 ugly I'm going to the sixth or seventh 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:54.730
 art and there we have the 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:01.410
 no are very very useful for everything 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:05.930
 what they wanted and that's called the 

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:05.930
 surfing tails and all that makes 

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:12.120
 something that can detect the 

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:14.130
 dram and the caylar possible points I 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:17.489
 will show you a quick system 

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:17.850
 which will allow you two very 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:25.470
 happy 

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:28.220
 So this is it 

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:28.220
 you do that 

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:31.110
 it 

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:40.389
 and here you have your choice look 

00:04:37.879 --> 00:04:40.389
 this clash 

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:52.110
 and here it is perfect so here I am 

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:52.110
 shows you a small system with 

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:59.949
 and to all and so here we are on the 

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:01.990
 news to wray the new rules 

00:04:59.949 --> 00:05:04.800
 which is called actuators a rail that 

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:06.060
 allows to activate something post plan 

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:09.850
 above 

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:11.860
 that's how it will be seal is so in 

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:13.419
 does when there is a monica that work 

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:15.130
 on it's going to activate something by 

00:05:13.419 --> 00:05:17.680
 example of the very practical quality for 

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:20.080
 the piech and so talking about traps 

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:22.810
 we have the new michael mann card 

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:25.810
 with TNT that can allow him to 

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:27.610
 lighthouses we trap even though I can still 

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:29.919
 really found the thing and that's the 

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:32.910
 mannequin technip a simple if there are 

00:05:29.919 --> 00:05:32.910
 steps that falls below 

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:37.759
 he's in the hopper and after that the year 

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:42.289
 put directly somewhere that can 

00:05:37.759 --> 00:05:44.270
 very well offered to lead c stÃ© sailing and 

00:05:42.289 --> 00:05:46.879
 so here we are on this video end 

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:48.560
 this video end that is sure the still 

00:05:46.879 --> 00:05:50.389
 once the trap of the end of video is 

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:52.220
 really a lot about the pitfalls and who 

00:05:50.389 --> 00:05:53.840
 speaks of the trap and the trapeze Chestres 

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:57.110
 just let them buy 

00:05:53.840 --> 00:06:00.259
 who traps you but we are on the end of 

00:05:57.110 --> 00:06:01.729
 the video of the 1.5 so the magic of 

00:06:00.259 --> 00:06:04.250
 the ain points 5 that talks a lot about 

00:06:01.729 --> 00:06:07.370
 redstone of external traps and so we 

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:09.440
 here is the end of video and so bah 

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:13.150
 me people I tell you next time 

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:13.150
 took 5 days good go paris 

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:18.870
 and 

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:21.270
 the
