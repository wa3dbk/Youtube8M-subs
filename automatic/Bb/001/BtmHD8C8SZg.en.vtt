00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:03.040
Ready go

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:04.580
Ta-da!

00:00:05.404 --> 00:00:07.404
I first thought you were drawing a rice ball.

00:00:07.404 --> 00:00:10.444
I am finished!  - How ugly!

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:14.160
Hellooooooooo I am Aoi, today's reporter.

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.620
I will ask people to draw pictures for us.

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.220
Today's topiiiic iiis...

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:28.500
Draw each other's faces!

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:33.120
How do you want to draw her?

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.420
I want to draw her in a cute way!

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:37.148
I want to draw her in a beautiful way.

00:00:37.177 --> 00:00:39.177
How have you become friends?

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.480
We went to the same high school and university.

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:44.060
From highschool!

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:46.960
So you know each others traits really well?

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.560
We ought to.

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.404
We are sisters.

00:00:51.404 --> 00:00:54.220
WHaaat? Sisters?

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:57.380
You are both so cute. Who is the older sister?   - Me!

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.700
How would you like to draw her?

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.620
Kind of leisurely.

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:06.800
I want to draw her like her university nick name.

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:10.920
I want to draw her in a cute way.

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.690
Same here.

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:16.740
Looking at your pictures .... They really look like you.

00:01:16.744 --> 00:01:18.062
They do!

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:20.580
What's her most charming feature? Her lashes!

00:01:21.132 --> 00:01:23.132
I will focus on her eyebrow.

00:01:23.684 --> 00:01:25.684
?In a soothing way?

00:01:25.684 --> 00:01:27.680
The hairstyle!

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:32.000
Is this the shape of her face? - Yes.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.200
I first thought you were drawing a rice ball.

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.200
This kinda looks gross.

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.032
Oh no, yours looks really cute!

00:01:38.174 --> 00:01:40.018
Finished!

00:01:40.018 --> 00:01:41.320
I am finished.

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:43.440
That's the worst!

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:44.945
That's quite bad.

00:01:44.945 --> 00:01:47.825
My hair nickname is coming through!

00:01:47.826 --> 00:01:49.826
I think it resembles you.

00:01:52.476 --> 00:01:55.676
Let's have a look. Ready go!

00:01:55.676 --> 00:02:00.996
Ta-daaaaaaaaaaa!

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
Could you please explain?

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.480
She looks like this today, but

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:09.300
usually she parts it in the middle and wears it in open fluffy curls.

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:13.680
Her lashes are quite long so I drew them on.

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.660
Here eyebrows are just like that in real life.

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:21.340
Did you think you managed to portray her fluffiness alright?

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:22.462
YES

00:02:22.462 --> 00:02:27.340
Her nickname is peanuts. So I tried to give her a peanuts like appereance.

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:29.340
She looks a little like a skeleton now.

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:33.000
It doesn't look cute, but she looks like her name!

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.420
I first thought this was an eggplant.

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:39.820
It looks like a proper peanut!

00:02:40.442 --> 00:02:42.442
Can you explain that again?

00:02:42.442 --> 00:02:45.102
This is the hair on her side.

00:02:45.102 --> 00:02:49.340
I picked up her slim face and the heavy eye makeup she wears.

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:52.460
The sparkles are used to explain her beauty?

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:57.780
My sister curls her hair quite a lot in strange ways.

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:59.310
I expressed it like that.

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:01.055
I looks a little bit like me!

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:04.300
No special curl today? - Princess curl!

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:05.030
That's cute.

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:08.980
The picture she drew of me looks very cute.

00:03:09.165 --> 00:03:11.165
You focused on the lashes...

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:16.720
You always have a straight fringe, and very memorable lashes.

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:24.120
She always smiles a lot. So I gave her a smile and today's hairstyle.

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:27.160
Thanks for drawing me in such a cute way.

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:35.340
We have been good friends for a while, but we have not drawn each others pictures before. It looks very natural.

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:53.420
Could you draw a picture?

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:56.900
Got it. What will we draw today?

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:58.600
Myself?

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:00.342
I mistook where my eyebrows are.

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:03.060
Whaaaat? My special trade...

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:04.941
Is that ok?

00:04:04.941 --> 00:04:06.888
I am finished

00:04:06.888 --> 00:04:08.833
Ready!

00:04:08.969 --> 00:04:10.969
Ta-Da!

00:04:11.389 --> 00:04:13.389
How is it?

00:04:15.921 --> 00:04:17.921
It doesn't look like me?

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:23.300
Could you show it to the camera?

00:04:25.648 --> 00:04:27.648
Eyes!

00:04:27.648 --> 00:04:29.479
You should have an easier face!

00:04:29.479 --> 00:04:31.289
Same goes for you!
