is gonna lift the ball up higher in the

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.170 
is gonna lift the ball up higher in the
air<00:01:03.809> put<00:01:04.199> some<00:01:04.350> trajectory<00:01:04.530> on<00:01:05.220> it<00:01:05.400> and<00:01:05.549> really

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
air put some trajectory on it and really

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.390 
air put some trajectory on it and really
use<00:01:06.540> that<00:01:06.570> topspin<00:01:07.260> to<00:01:07.680> bring<00:01:07.860> the<00:01:07.979> ball<00:01:08.130> back

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400
