00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:13.840
 It's a start I'll start with the first one 

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:16.000
 daniel figueiredo what the star is 

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:17.590
 finding this new partnership curitiba and 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.490
 and this shows that large 

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:25.170
 athlete is and human being that he is congratulations 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:28.810
 daniel wolff inherits fantastic 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:33.970
 I played in Coritiba from 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:37.150
 Ten years of eight years is to have an empathy 

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:39.850
 great with the study cause and now they 

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:41.649
 are waiting for the team I 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:43.780
 I was playing and now you know that Coritiba 

00:00:41.649 --> 00:00:47.079
 already creating this relationship really 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:49.120
 It's fantastic for me to see that I did the 

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:51.160
 Well done things both here and there right? 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:54.070
 so I'm quite satisfied and I hope 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:55.090
 that the partnership beliefs and keep for a 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:57.399
 long period 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:59.010
 on a nice question you already said 

00:00:57.399 --> 00:01:01.899
 enough about this from vilson jÃºnior 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.890
 alex the project is for brazilian champion 

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:05.500
 liberators 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:08.140
 Thank you, if I may say, it 's the difference. 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:10.270
 between the champion and second a champion 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:13.420
 if the fifth is sometimes too small 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:15.840
 You always have to work with the 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:18.520
 goal to reach the highest point 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:21.130
 It's too early to talk in layers. 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:23.649
 Brazilian who does not know what to 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:26.679
 will happen from January 

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:28.450
 but my individual thought that 

00:01:26.679 --> 00:01:31.899
 I passed the president is to make a 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:33.310
 curitiba strong a competitive curitiba and 

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:35.830
 with the objective of winning the competitions 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:36.670
 independent depending on the competition 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:40.300
 that is 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:43.539
 I have here that maybe it's Turkish and it 's 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:48.670
 so say the boy's name here and translate 

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:52.360

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:58.300

 Fenerbache's brother club and will take 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:03.220
 God, I succeed with this new 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:04.390
 shirt and curitiba pass is to reach your 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:06.130
 goals 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:08.110
 we have one more here from lucas lima 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:10.000
 what is your real expectation for the 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:12.280
 next season is a team of Coritiba 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.900
 strong competitive team in which I fought 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:15.900
 in the first positions 

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:25.409
 it he said it has a witness 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:27.690
 here right sounds Sussumu Swiss mean 

00:02:25.409 --> 00:02:30.060
 which is the fan has a situation in the 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:32.580
 turkey that he says the last word 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:34.890
 is always fenerbache so it puts 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:37.170
 the more he is accompanying it 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:39.950
 he is liking it more than the fenerbahÃ§e 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:42.299
 is beyond any reason for him 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:44.519
 to end with that of the Julian 

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:46.829
 silva read because I liked excellence 

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:49.709
 His question is also to answer well. 

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:51.840
