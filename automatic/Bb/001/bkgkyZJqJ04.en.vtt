summer camp and i have made a video in a
while<00:00:08.790> i<00:00:09.179> decided<00:00:09.750> to<00:00:09.809> do<00:00:09.900> something

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.080 
while i decided to do something

while i decided to do something
different<00:00:10.200> so<00:00:10.950> here<00:00:11.130> it<00:00:11.219> is<00:00:11.280> this<00:00:11.940> build<00:00:12.179> is

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
different so here it is this build is

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:13.490 
different so here it is this build is
aimed<00:00:12.480> at<00:00:12.630> giving<00:00:12.719> you<00:00:12.900> similar<00:00:13.230> performance

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
aimed at giving you similar performance

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.560 
aimed at giving you similar performance
and<00:00:13.950> looks<00:00:14.250> to<00:00:14.429> the<00:00:14.519> new<00:00:14.670> ps4<00:00:14.910> which<00:00:15.299> is<00:00:15.389> coming

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
and looks to the new ps4 which is coming

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.779 
and looks to the new ps4 which is coming
out<00:00:15.690> of<00:00:15.750> the<00:00:15.870> holiday<00:00:16.170> season<00:00:16.529> this<00:00:17.400> although

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
out of the holiday season this although

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:19.130 
out of the holiday season this although
this<00:00:17.970> does<00:00:18.240> cost<00:00:18.480> forward<00:00:18.779> them<00:00:18.900> the<00:00:19.020> actual

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
this does cost forward them the actual

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.170 
this does cost forward them the actual
vs<00:00:19.439> for<00:00:19.680> itself<00:00:19.949> it<00:00:20.220> will<00:00:20.609> give<00:00:20.820> you<00:00:20.939> improve

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
vs for itself it will give you improve

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:22.429 
vs for itself it will give you improve
performance<00:00:21.480> because<00:00:21.869> it<00:00:21.990> has<00:00:22.170> its<00:00:22.320> own

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
performance because it has its own

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:24.230 
performance because it has its own
dedicated<00:00:22.590> graphics<00:00:23.250> card<00:00:23.400> and<00:00:23.609> because<00:00:24.150> it

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
dedicated graphics card and because it

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.509 
dedicated graphics card and because it
has<00:00:24.359> other<00:00:24.480> improved<00:00:24.810> components<00:00:25.320> this<00:00:26.310> build

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
has other improved components this build

will be able to run the best games out
there<00:00:28.019> on<00:00:28.380> the<00:00:28.470> market<00:00:28.590> at<00:00:28.980> high<00:00:29.609> or<00:00:30.000> maybe

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
there on the market at high or maybe

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:31.669 
there on the market at high or maybe
normal<00:00:30.630> settings<00:00:30.960> depending<00:00:31.140> on<00:00:31.500> how

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
normal settings depending on how

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.470 
normal settings depending on how
graphically<00:00:32.099> intensive<00:00:32.430> they<00:00:32.579> are<00:00:32.730> for

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
graphically intensive they are for

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.150 
graphically intensive they are for
example<00:00:33.570> Crysis<00:00:34.140> 3<00:00:34.170> will<00:00:34.500> be<00:00:34.530> able<00:00:34.739> to<00:00:34.920> run<00:00:35.040> at

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
example Crysis 3 will be able to run at

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.130 
example Crysis 3 will be able to run at
normal<00:00:35.460> settings<00:00:35.790> but<00:00:36.360> battlefield<00:00:36.750> 3<00:00:37.020> and

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
normal settings but battlefield 3 and

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:38.479 
normal settings but battlefield 3 and
far<00:00:37.260> cry<00:00:37.410> 3<00:00:37.469> you<00:00:37.680> should<00:00:37.829> be<00:00:37.980> able<00:00:38.070> to<00:00:38.250> run<00:00:38.399> on

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
far cry 3 you should be able to run on

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.819 
far cry 3 you should be able to run on
high<00:00:38.640> just<00:00:38.969> fine<00:00:39.149> so<00:00:40.079> this<00:00:40.230> build<00:00:40.440> will<00:00:40.559> cost

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
high just fine so this build will cost

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:42.110 
high just fine so this build will cost
you<00:00:40.980> around<00:00:41.040> five<00:00:41.340> hundred<00:00:41.610> thirty<00:00:41.790> dollars

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
let's get on with the build to start it

let's get on with the build to start it
all<00:00:50.190> off<00:00:50.340> we're<00:00:50.579> going<00:00:50.670> to<00:00:50.760> be<00:00:50.820> using<00:00:51.030> an<00:00:51.239> AMD

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
all off we're going to be using an AMD

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:01.910 
FX 83 real cores just like the ps4 does

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:04.189 
FX 83 real cores just like the ps4 does
this<00:01:02.910> process<00:01:03.120> or<00:01:03.449> handles<00:01:03.719> pretty<00:01:03.809> much<00:01:04.019> any

game that's on the market today that you

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.000 
game that's on the market today that you
throw<00:01:05.970> at<00:01:06.119> it<00:01:06.229> out<00:01:07.229> of<00:01:07.350> the<00:01:07.409> box<00:01:07.619> it<00:01:07.890> comes

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
throw at it out of the box it comes

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:09.350 
throw at it out of the box it comes

which<00:01:09.689> is<00:01:09.840> quite<00:01:10.110> a<00:01:10.170> lot<00:01:10.380> and<00:01:10.590> it<00:01:10.770> should<00:01:10.950> be

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
which is quite a lot and it should be

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.200 
which is quite a lot and it should be
enough<00:01:11.220> for<00:01:11.280> running<00:01:11.700> like<00:01:11.880> normal

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
enough for running like normal

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.800 
enough for running like normal
day-to-day<00:01:12.390> tasks<00:01:12.780> and<00:01:13.880> sorry<00:01:14.880> and<00:01:15.119> most

battlefield 3 even Crysis 3 as long as

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:25.469 
battlefield 3 even Crysis 3 as long as
you<00:01:23.259> turn<00:01:23.409> the<00:01:23.439> settings<00:01:23.799> down<00:01:23.920> a<00:01:23.979> bit<00:01:24.479> but

00:01:25.469 --> 00:01:25.479 
you turn the settings down a bit but

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:27.240 
you turn the settings down a bit but
should<00:01:25.869> you<00:01:25.899> choose<00:01:26.229> to<00:01:26.289> overclock<00:01:26.770> it<00:01:26.799> it<00:01:27.100> is

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:27.250 
should you choose to overclock it it is

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:28.859 
should you choose to overclock it it is
a<00:01:27.280> lot<00:01:27.579> so<00:01:27.789> that<00:01:27.909> makes<00:01:28.060> it<00:01:28.179> easy<00:01:28.360> to<00:01:28.479> overclock

00:01:28.859 --> 00:01:28.869 
a lot so that makes it easy to overclock

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:30.690 
a lot so that makes it easy to overclock
it<00:01:28.899> up<00:01:29.200> to<00:01:29.409> 4<00:01:29.619> gigahertz<00:01:29.890> and<00:01:30.219> possibly<00:01:30.549> even

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:14.480 
reason we're using a gigabytes of this

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:16.090 
reason we're using a gigabytes of this
Ram<00:03:14.660> is<00:03:14.870> because<00:03:15.380> it's<00:03:15.530> basically<00:03:15.830> the

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:16.100 
Ram is because it's basically the

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:17.950 
Ram is because it's basically the
perfect<00:03:16.760> amount<00:03:17.000> for<00:03:17.330> any<00:03:17.510> game<00:03:17.780> out<00:03:17.930> there

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:17.960 
perfect amount for any game out there

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:20.410 
perfect amount for any game out there
and<00:03:18.320> because<00:03:19.040> the<00:03:19.130> ps4<00:03:19.370> has<00:03:19.550> just<00:03:20.000> as<00:03:20.120> much<00:03:20.240> in

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:20.420 
and because the ps4 has just as much in

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:22.900 
and because the ps4 has just as much in
it<00:03:20.510> obviously<00:03:21.320> we're<00:03:21.500> doing<00:03:21.740> a<00:03:21.890> copy<00:03:22.340> of<00:03:22.490> the

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:22.910 
it obviously we're doing a copy of the

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:24.490 
it obviously we're doing a copy of the
ps4<00:03:23.180> so<00:03:23.660> we're<00:03:23.780> trying<00:03:23.870> to<00:03:24.020> get<00:03:24.140> as<00:03:24.230> close<00:03:24.260> to

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:24.500 
ps4 so we're trying to get as close to

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:26.530 
ps4 so we're trying to get as close to
it<00:03:24.530> as<00:03:24.620> we<00:03:24.770> can<00:03:24.980> of<00:03:25.760> course<00:03:25.850> you<00:03:26.120> can<00:03:26.270> install

optional I decided to include it because
it<00:05:28.100> is<00:05:28.220> useful<00:05:28.640> to<00:05:28.670> have<00:05:28.850> a<00:05:28.910> CD<00:05:29.210> /<00:05:29.660> DVD<00:05:29.720> burner

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:32.600 
around just in case and because we are

around just in case and because we are

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:35.000 
in a way copying the ps4 so I thought it

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.480 
in a way copying the ps4 so I thought it
would<00:05:35.090> be<00:05:35.180> a<00:05:35.210> nice<00:05:35.450> final<00:05:35.840> touch<00:05:35.990> the<00:05:36.800> CD<00:05:37.190> /<00:05:37.430> DVD

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:40.280 
reader is a slim design because that's

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:42.550 
reader is a slim design because that's
all<00:05:40.400> that<00:05:40.550> our<00:05:40.640> case<00:05:40.760> will<00:05:40.910> support<00:05:41.410> but<00:05:42.410> even

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:42.560 
all that our case will support but even

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:44.200 
all that our case will support but even
so<00:05:42.890> it<00:05:43.250> does<00:05:43.550> look<00:05:43.730> nice<00:05:43.880> from<00:05:44.060> the<00:05:44.090> outside

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:44.210 
so it does look nice from the outside

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:46.210 
so it does look nice from the outside
and<00:05:44.690> it<00:05:44.990> functions<00:05:45.200> it's<00:05:45.500> just<00:05:45.680> as<00:05:45.800> well<00:05:45.830> as<00:05:46.160> a

and it functions it's just as well as a
