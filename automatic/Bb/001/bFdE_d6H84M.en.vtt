buff<00:00:47.730> but<00:00:48.149> I'd<00:00:48.329> ignore<00:00:48.510> that<00:00:48.870> one<00:00:48.989> hand<00:00:49.289> loaded

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
buff but I'd ignore that one hand loaded

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.260 
buff but I'd ignore that one hand loaded
this<00:00:49.739> one<00:00:49.950> is<00:00:50.100> effective<00:00:50.520> at<00:00:50.640> an<00:00:50.760> extended

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
this one is effective at an extended

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.000 
this one is effective at an extended
range<00:00:51.480> that<00:00:51.750> one<00:00:51.870> is<00:00:51.989> very<00:00:52.289> very<00:00:52.469> important

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
range that one is very very important

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.010 
range that one is very very important
but<00:00:53.579> the<00:00:53.699> reload<00:00:54.090> i<00:00:54.270> think<00:00:54.480> is<00:00:54.600> far<00:00:54.840> more

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
but the reload i think is far more

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.450 
but the reload i think is far more
important<00:00:55.500> for<00:00:55.649> a<00:00:55.680> weapon<00:00:55.980> that<00:00:56.039> shoots<00:00:56.309> at

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
important for a weapon that shoots at

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.010 
important for a weapon that shoots at
this<00:00:56.610> rate<00:00:56.820> of<00:00:56.940> fire<00:00:57.149> so<00:00:57.390> personally<00:00:57.780> I<00:00:57.809> say

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
this rate of fire so personally I say

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.990 
this rate of fire so personally I say
you<00:00:58.109> fluctuate<00:00:58.530> between<00:00:58.649> Henry<00:00:59.190> load<00:00:59.399> and<00:00:59.579> the

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
you fluctuate between Henry load and the

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.389 
you fluctuate between Henry load and the
reload<00:01:00.359> buff<00:01:00.840> it's<00:01:01.320> your<00:01:01.590> choice<00:01:01.649> return<00:01:02.250> to

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
reload buff it's your choice return to

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
one rarely happens and even when it does

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.070 
one rarely happens and even when it does
happen<00:01:08.400> it's<00:01:08.820> probably<00:01:09.570> not<00:01:09.810> going<00:01:09.960> to

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
happen it's probably not going to

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.140 
happen it's probably not going to
benefit<00:01:10.380> you<00:01:10.530> in<00:01:10.650> any<00:01:10.830> fashion<00:01:11.280> so<00:01:11.700> generally

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
that one just means nothing to me to be

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.890 
that one just means nothing to me to be
completely<00:01:14.070> honest<00:01:14.460> so<00:01:15.060> where<00:01:15.689> does<00:01:15.840> that

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
completely honest so where does that

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.899 
completely honest so where does that
leave<00:01:16.020> this<00:01:16.350> gun<00:01:16.590> which<00:01:17.040> perks<00:01:17.340> are<00:01:17.520> best<00:01:17.700> and

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
leave this gun which perks are best and

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:21.560 
leave this gun which perks are best and
why<00:01:18.180> this<00:01:18.960> gun<00:01:19.290> shoots<00:01:19.700> extremely<00:01:20.700> rapid<00:01:21.240> fire

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
why this gun shoots extremely rapid fire

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.120 
why this gun shoots extremely rapid fire
like<00:01:21.960> this<00:01:21.990> gun<00:01:22.439> just<00:01:22.619> blows<00:01:22.890> through

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
like this gun just blows through

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:24.980 
like this gun just blows through
ammunition<00:01:23.850> so<00:01:24.030> again<00:01:24.270> the<00:01:24.420> recoil<00:01:24.869> and

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
ammunition so again the recoil and

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.960 
ammunition so again the recoil and
stability<00:01:25.530> maybe<00:01:26.100> something<00:01:26.520> some<00:01:26.729> players

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
stability maybe something some players

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.090 
stability maybe something some players
want<00:01:27.240> to<00:01:27.330> go<00:01:27.450> with<00:01:27.689> personally<00:01:28.290> I<00:01:28.320> say<00:01:28.770> avoid

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
want to go with personally I say avoid

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.649 
want to go with personally I say avoid
it<00:01:29.250> I<00:01:29.369> think<00:01:29.430> the<00:01:29.729> impact<00:01:30.090> and<00:01:30.270> everything

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
it I think the impact and everything

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.149 
it I think the impact and everything
like<00:01:30.810> that<00:01:30.869> really<00:01:31.229> matters<00:01:31.680> a<00:01:31.710> little<00:01:31.890> bit

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
like that really matters a little bit

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.370 
like that really matters a little bit
more<00:01:32.430> so<00:01:33.270> I<00:01:33.299> go<00:01:33.570> with<00:01:33.750> the<00:01:33.869> final<00:01:34.229> one<00:01:34.350> the

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
more so I go with the final one the

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:35.810 
more so I go with the final one the
field<00:01:34.680> choke<00:01:34.950> for<00:01:35.159> the<00:01:35.220> first<00:01:35.460> one<00:01:35.670> of<00:01:35.790> course

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
field choke for the first one of course

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.850 
field choke for the first one of course
moving<00:01:36.360> on<00:01:36.479> over<00:01:36.720> to<00:01:36.810> the<00:01:36.840> final<00:01:37.259> one<00:01:37.380> I<00:01:37.470> go

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
moving on over to the final one I go

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.149 
moving on over to the final one I go
speed<00:01:38.250> reload<00:01:38.729> over<00:01:39.630> the<00:01:39.960> alternative<00:01:40.619> where

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
speed reload over the alternative where

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:42.950 
speed reload over the alternative where
you<00:01:41.280> have<00:01:41.490> that<00:01:41.700> additional<00:01:41.939> range<00:01:42.450> but<00:01:42.750> that

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
you have that additional range but that

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.719 
you have that additional range but that
is<00:01:43.140> good<00:01:43.350> for<00:01:43.380> a<00:01:43.799> player<00:01:44.100> that<00:01:44.130> needs<00:01:44.490> if<00:01:44.610> that

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
is good for a player that needs if that

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.160 
is good for a player that needs if that
range<00:01:44.970> is<00:01:45.149> really<00:01:45.450> really<00:01:45.600> important<00:01:46.079> the

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
range is really really important the

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.380 
range is really really important the
only<00:01:46.350> thing<00:01:46.560> is<00:01:46.590> is<00:01:46.979> I<00:01:47.340> find<00:01:47.610> speed<00:01:47.939> reload<00:01:48.270> to

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
only thing is is I find speed reload to

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:49.550 
only thing is is I find speed reload to
be<00:01:48.509> a<00:01:48.540> little<00:01:48.720> bit<00:01:48.840> more<00:01:49.020> important<00:01:49.439> because

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
be a little bit more important because

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.139 
be a little bit more important because
this<00:01:49.770> gun<00:01:49.950> blows<00:01:50.220> through<00:01:50.399> ammo<00:01:50.700> extremely

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
this gun blows through ammo extremely

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:53.030 
this gun blows through ammo extremely
fast<00:01:51.420> you<00:01:51.869> need<00:01:51.990> to<00:01:52.110> be<00:01:52.200> able<00:01:52.290> to<00:01:52.439> reload<00:01:52.829> to

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
fast you need to be able to reload to

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.889 
fast you need to be able to reload to
catch<00:01:53.220> multiple<00:01:53.579> people<00:01:54.180> so<00:01:54.360> in<00:01:54.540> most

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
catch multiple people so in most

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:56.780 
catch multiple people so in most
situations<00:01:55.110> in<00:01:55.799> certain<00:01:56.219> maps<00:01:56.460> you're<00:01:56.670> going

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
situations in certain maps you're going

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.219 
situations in certain maps you're going
to<00:01:56.850> be<00:01:56.939> using<00:01:57.090> this<00:01:57.299> you<00:01:57.479> need<00:01:57.600> to<00:01:57.719> debate<00:01:58.020> on

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
to be using this you need to debate on

00:01:58.229 --> 00:01:59.569 
to be using this you need to debate on
whether<00:01:58.409> or<00:01:58.560> not<00:01:58.649> you<00:01:58.890> need<00:01:58.920> to<00:01:59.159> use<00:01:59.310> this<00:01:59.460> so

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
whether or not you need to use this so

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:00.440 
whether or not you need to use this so
if<00:01:59.640> you're<00:01:59.759> playing<00:01:59.909> on<00:02:00.090> something<00:02:00.329> like

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
if you're playing on something like

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:01.789 
if you're playing on something like
Delphi<00:02:00.869> we're<00:02:01.049> going<00:02:01.259> to<00:02:01.320> be<00:02:01.380> around<00:02:01.530> the<00:02:01.680> be

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
Delphi we're going to be around the be

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:03.800 
Delphi we're going to be around the be
objective<00:02:02.219> on<00:02:02.340> control<00:02:02.729> I'd<00:02:03.270> say<00:02:03.420> the<00:02:03.570> speed

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
objective on control I'd say the speed

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.380 
objective on control I'd say the speed
reload<00:02:04.229> really<00:02:04.740> really<00:02:05.040> matters<00:02:05.790> a<00:02:05.820> lot<00:02:06.090> more

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
reload really really matters a lot more

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:07.789 
reload really really matters a lot more
than<00:02:06.600> the<00:02:06.689> range<00:02:06.960> would<00:02:07.229> in<00:02:07.350> that<00:02:07.469> situation

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
than the range would in that situation

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:09.619 
than the range would in that situation
because<00:02:08.280> the<00:02:08.429> reload<00:02:08.729> is<00:02:08.910> significantly

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
because the reload is significantly

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:12.380 
because the reload is significantly
weaker<00:02:10.319> now<00:02:10.470> if<00:02:10.590> you<00:02:10.709> had<00:02:10.890> some<00:02:11.099> nice<00:02:11.390> gloves

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
weaker now if you had some nice gloves

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:13.820 
weaker now if you had some nice gloves
that<00:02:12.660> increase<00:02:13.050> the<00:02:13.230> reload

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
that increase the reload

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.310 
that increase the reload
time<00:02:14.160> I'd<00:02:14.520> say<00:02:14.730> go<00:02:14.880> with<00:02:15.000> the<00:02:15.150> range<00:02:15.360> one<00:02:15.600> again

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:16.320 
time I'd say go with the range one again

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:18.320 
time I'd say go with the range one again
this<00:02:16.500> thing<00:02:16.710> can<00:02:17.010> drop<00:02:17.460> people<00:02:17.790> just<00:02:18.030> like<00:02:18.150> you

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
this thing can drop people just like you

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.270 
this thing can drop people just like you
saw<00:02:18.540> right<00:02:18.810> there<00:02:19.020> consistently<00:02:19.650> while<00:02:20.040> still

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
saw right there consistently while still

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.850 
saw right there consistently while still
having<00:02:20.460> that<00:02:20.670> range<00:02:21.090> reduction<00:02:21.680> you<00:02:22.680> got<00:02:22.830> a

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
having that range reduction you got a

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.250 
having that range reduction you got a
pic<00:02:23.160> and<00:02:23.300> adjust<00:02:24.300> your<00:02:24.420> play<00:02:24.660> style<00:02:24.930> to<00:02:25.140> which

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
pic and adjust your play style to which

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:26.810 
pic and adjust your play style to which
one<00:02:25.470> you<00:02:25.590> go<00:02:25.740> with<00:02:25.920> so<00:02:26.040> honestly<00:02:26.400> I'd<00:02:26.580> see<00:02:26.700> it's

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:26.820 
one you go with so honestly I'd see it's

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:27.770 
one you go with so honestly I'd see it's
a<00:02:26.880> little<00:02:27.060> bit<00:02:27.180> safer<00:02:27.300> for<00:02:27.600> the<00:02:27.660> average

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
a little bit safer for the average

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.080 
a little bit safer for the average
player<00:02:28.140> to<00:02:28.680> go<00:02:28.830> with<00:02:29.040> the<00:02:29.190> range<00:02:29.460> version<00:02:29.970> on

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
player to go with the range version on

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:31.550 
player to go with the range version on
the<00:02:30.120> second<00:02:30.510> part<00:02:30.690> of<00:02:30.750> the<00:02:30.840> tree<00:02:31.020> versus<00:02:31.470> the

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
the second part of the tree versus the

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.170 
the second part of the tree versus the
reload<00:02:31.890> but<00:02:32.130> personally<00:02:32.460> for<00:02:32.580> my<00:02:32.700> play<00:02:32.940> style

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
reload but personally for my play style

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:34.760 
reload but personally for my play style
if<00:02:33.570> you're<00:02:33.690> going<00:02:33.840> with<00:02:33.930> like<00:02:34.140> a<00:02:34.170> blink<00:02:34.500> build

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:34.770 
if you're going with like a blink build

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:36.170 
if you're going with like a blink build
or<00:02:35.040> something<00:02:35.310> like<00:02:35.430> that<00:02:35.490> it's<00:02:36.060> an

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
or something like that it's an

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.240 
or something like that it's an
incredible<00:02:36.600> way<00:02:36.780> to<00:02:36.810> go<00:02:37.050> with<00:02:37.230> it<00:02:37.260> so<00:02:37.500> overall

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
incredible way to go with it so overall

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:40.610 
incredible way to go with it so overall
how<00:02:38.430> does<00:02:38.940> this<00:02:39.060> gun<00:02:39.270> perform<00:02:39.720> again<00:02:40.290> this<00:02:40.410> gun

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
how does this gun perform again this gun

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.230 
how does this gun perform again this gun
is<00:02:40.650> probably<00:02:41.190> good<00:02:41.430> for<00:02:41.460> team<00:02:41.820> deathmatch

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:42.240 
is probably good for team deathmatch

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:44.570 
is probably good for team deathmatch
skirmish<00:02:42.810> would<00:02:42.990> not<00:02:43.230> be<00:02:43.380> half<00:02:43.650> bad<00:02:43.680> but<00:02:44.490> you

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580 
skirmish would not be half bad but you

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:45.740 
skirmish would not be half bad but you
want<00:02:44.700> to<00:02:44.760> stick<00:02:44.940> to<00:02:45.030> certain<00:02:45.210> close<00:02:45.450> quarter

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
want to stick to certain close quarter

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:47.480 
want to stick to certain close quarter
maps<00:02:45.960> because<00:02:46.110> this<00:02:46.410> range<00:02:46.680> is<00:02:46.890> the<00:02:46.920> worst<00:02:47.280> for

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:47.490 
maps because this range is the worst for

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:50.270 
maps because this range is the worst for
shotguns<00:02:47.970> period<00:02:48.480> so<00:02:48.990> the<00:02:49.530> way<00:02:49.680> I<00:02:49.710> look<00:02:50.040> at<00:02:50.250> it

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
shotguns period so the way I look at it

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.850 
shotguns period so the way I look at it
play<00:02:50.790> on<00:02:50.940> like<00:02:51.120> firebase<00:02:51.540> Delphi<00:02:51.990> close

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
play on like firebase Delphi close

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:54.830 
play on like firebase Delphi close
quarters<00:02:53.220> TDM<00:02:53.580> is<00:02:53.700> something<00:02:54.000> great<00:02:54.300> this

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
quarters TDM is something great this

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.390 
quarters TDM is something great this
thing<00:02:55.050> does<00:02:55.290> have<00:02:55.500> its<00:02:55.680> limitations<00:02:55.740> though

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
thing does have its limitations though

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:59.150 
thing does have its limitations though
because<00:02:56.550> it<00:02:56.820> is<00:02:56.940> range<00:02:57.300> reliant<00:02:58.230> you<00:02:58.770> have<00:02:59.010> to

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160 
because it is range reliant you have to

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:00.949 
because it is range reliant you have to
be<00:02:59.280> really<00:02:59.820> really<00:02:59.940> close<00:03:00.209> quarters<00:03:00.660> to<00:03:00.840> do

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:00.959 
be really really close quarters to do

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:02.990 
be really really close quarters to do
this<00:03:01.110> so<00:03:01.290> in<00:03:01.470> comparison<00:03:02.160> to<00:03:02.670> the<00:03:02.760> like<00:03:02.850> the

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
this so in comparison to the like the

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.520 
this so in comparison to the like the
invective<00:03:03.480> which<00:03:03.630> is<00:03:03.750> another<00:03:03.959> weapon<00:03:04.230> that's

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
invective which is another weapon that's

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:06.860 
invective which is another weapon that's
very<00:03:04.740> similar<00:03:04.950> this<00:03:05.310> is<00:03:05.490> also<00:03:05.760> an<00:03:06.030> exotic<00:03:06.450> the

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
very similar this is also an exotic the

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:08.449 
very similar this is also an exotic the
invective<00:03:07.350> seems<00:03:07.590> to<00:03:07.709> perform<00:03:08.040> a<00:03:08.160> little<00:03:08.340> bit

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:08.459 
invective seems to perform a little bit

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:10.730 
invective seems to perform a little bit
better<00:03:08.610> than<00:03:08.910> this<00:03:09.030> one<00:03:09.270> overall<00:03:10.050> so<00:03:10.440> you<00:03:10.500> have

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:10.740 
better than this one overall so you have

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:12.380 
better than this one overall so you have
an<00:03:10.860> exclusive<00:03:11.220> that's<00:03:11.820> not<00:03:11.970> as<00:03:12.120> good<00:03:12.300> as

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:12.390 
an exclusive that's not as good as

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:13.730 
an exclusive that's not as good as
another<00:03:12.630> gun<00:03:12.870> that<00:03:13.020> almost<00:03:13.200> does<00:03:13.410> the<00:03:13.530> same

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:13.740 
another gun that almost does the same

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:15.830 
another gun that almost does the same
exact<00:03:14.190> thing<00:03:14.580> and<00:03:14.880> then<00:03:15.330> in<00:03:15.510> the<00:03:15.660> same

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 
exact thing and then in the same

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:18.050 
exact thing and then in the same
category<00:03:16.080> you<00:03:16.590> have<00:03:16.740> legendary<00:03:17.370> raid<00:03:17.670> weapons

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060

down sight to focus that spread that

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:42.830 
down sight to focus that spread that
cone<00:04:40.920> so<00:04:41.190> you<00:04:41.250> are<00:04:41.550> more<00:04:41.850> on<00:04:42.030> point<00:04:42.300> with<00:04:42.600> these

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:46.820 
shots and I find that when I aim down
sight<00:04:45.270> just<00:04:45.540> a<00:04:45.630> pro<00:04:45.840> tip<00:04:46.110> for<00:04:46.140> you<00:04:46.410> guys<00:04:46.590> when<00:04:46.800> I

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:46.830 
sight just a pro tip for you guys when I

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:49.220 
sight just a pro tip for you guys when I
aim<00:04:47.040> down<00:04:47.220> sight<00:04:47.520> I<00:04:47.700> find<00:04:48.240> that<00:04:48.420> the<00:04:48.540> recoil<00:04:48.990> is

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:49.230 
aim down sight I find that the recoil is

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:51.140 
aim down sight I find that the recoil is
much<00:04:49.500> more<00:04:49.740> manageable<00:04:50.010> so<00:04:50.520> again<00:04:50.820> that's

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:51.150 
much more manageable so again that's

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:53.000 
much more manageable so again that's

personally recommend it I almost always

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:09.350 
personally recommend it I almost always
run<00:05:08.130> it<00:05:08.250> that<00:05:08.370> way<00:05:08.490> but<00:05:08.550> the<00:05:08.760> range<00:05:09.000> is<00:05:09.180> good

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:09.360 
run it that way but the range is good

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:10.850
