 Vettel I almost had the know-how 

00:02:15.249 --> 00:02:17.730
 yes that would be the whole playing field you have to see this one 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:20.730
 therefore find 

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:26.689
 and watch out 

00:02:26.689 --> 00:02:28.809
 with the corresponding markets 

00:02:28.809 --> 00:02:31.189
 that means fighting for customers 

00:02:31.189 --> 00:02:34.189
 You should be through high time 

00:02:37.109 --> 00:02:40.109
 but you can not be visited 

00:02:40.619 --> 00:02:42.049
 Of course, there are currently with Buy 

00:02:42.049 --> 00:02:44.419
 Luc Besson has a thousand seconds 

00:02:44.419 --> 00:02:47.639
 we would have 4 already 

00:02:47.639 --> 00:02:49.429
 so built up 

00:02:49.429 --> 00:02:52.429
 30 chapels too 

00:03:03.189 --> 00:03:04.869
 how everything works fine 

00:03:04.869 --> 00:03:06.509
 that's me at the moment 

00:03:06.509 --> 00:03:09.509
 would have to flow for Kacar times 

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:12.749

00:03:12.749 --> 00:03:15.749

00:03:18.159 --> 00:03:20.179
 the next fights 

00:03:20.179 --> 00:03:22.919
 something like that should be crumb is it is called 

00:03:22.919 --> 00:03:25.919

 Eating cherries 

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:54.199
 the games gets from me 

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:56.379
 what can I give in the game in front of me 

00:03:56.379 --> 00:03:59.729
 Zacher will end worry here 

00:03:59.729 --> 00:04:03.039
 von Vonn l 15 points lottery 

00:04:07.539 --> 00:04:08.879
 yes 4 

00:04:08.879 --> 00:04:10.699
 critically examine more points 

00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:13.629
 the next scene that we even more on from IZ 

00:04:13.629 --> 00:04:16.919
 her spokesman Stuart Sports Events it few the resemblance to the 

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:18.639
 RPG from my childhood 

00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:22.449
 and this noticed it was true sprout Principe Rietdorf and that of 

00:04:22.449 --> 00:04:25.319
 Play Garfield for the Gameboy 

00:04:25.319 --> 00:04:27.479
 one to one the same 

00:04:27.479 --> 00:04:30.599
 we were allowed to Poland's blessing Cantz 

00:04:30.599 --> 00:04:31.999
 is brings the victory 

00:04:31.999 --> 00:04:34.080
 only exchanged figure 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:37.080
 and the worry is even Garfield is only with village 

00:04:38.659 --> 00:04:41.680
 from the mile Polish track Mickey Mouse 4 

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:42.900
 awful or 

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:46.440
 three times the same game the child place in front of the child get in part 

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:49.629
 Gifts every three hours playtime must determine 

00:04:49.629 --> 00:04:52.629
 What is that and it is good you have to save 

00:04:54.349 --> 00:04:55.580
 dreadful 

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:57.719
 you could have made a lot more of it 

00:04:57.719 --> 00:05:00.020
 per year for about 2 9 

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:02.779
 It should have been the first overpriced crew 

00:05:02.779 --> 00:05:04.759
 the myth Basterds 

00:05:04.759 --> 00:05:05.649
 that was nothing
