00:05:54.399 --> 00:06:03.359 

so<00:05:55.399> 3<00:05:57.219> 1<00:05:59.589> 1<00:06:00.589> on<00:06:00.889> the<00:06:01.009> a-string

00:06:03.359 --> 00:06:03.369 

00:06:03.369 --> 00:06:42.080

00:06:44.010 --> 00:06:44.020 
so then at the end there's just a

00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:45.870 
so then at the end there's just a
variety<00:06:44.170> of<00:06:44.620> stops<00:06:45.100> and<00:06:45.340> I'm<00:06:45.490> not<00:06:45.610> gonna<00:06:45.760> go

00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:45.880 
variety of stops and I'm not gonna go

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:47.990 
variety of stops and I'm not gonna go
for<00:06:46.000> all<00:06:46.060> of<00:06:46.120> them<00:06:46.360> because<00:06:46.630> there's<00:06:46.960> loes<00:06:47.140> but

00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:48.000

just ever listen to the song

00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:52.560 
just ever listen to the song
so<00:06:50.470> the<00:06:50.980> riff<00:06:51.400> is<00:06:51.490> the<00:06:51.610> same<00:06:51.850> that<00:06:52.150> is<00:06:52.210> putting

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:52.570

00:06:52.570 --> 00:06:54.600 
so the riff is the same that is putting
different<00:06:52.690> stops<00:06:53.080> in<00:06:53.290> there<00:06:53.410> at<00:06:53.530> the<00:06:53.620> end<00:06:53.740> so

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:54.610 
different stops in there at the end so

00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:58.170 
different stops in there at the end so
that<00:06:54.640> is<00:06:54.910> how<00:06:55.030> to<00:06:55.090> play<00:06:55.330> the<00:06:55.510> end<00:06:55.690> complete
