00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:15.220
 jett so I can talk to you about 

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:17.560
 jet maintenance that the famous review 

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:20.470
 where we think it is the 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:22.480
 review periodically simply change the 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:24.970
 film and change oil 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:28.210
 Mistake if someone is doing this. 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:31.270
 out there be very careful with this review 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:34.300
 the name itself says review review is a 

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:37.239
 blackmail of a series of items that 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:41.320
 They usually like to give trouble. 

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:42.730
 ok so basically we want 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:46.329
 inform you 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:47.410
 about procedures and what to check 

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:50.379
 this review 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:51.879
 here in the object I made a point of doing 

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:56.050
 this video directly from our 

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:58.030
 where you can see the 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:00.370
 every investment that has been made 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:02.620
 to take care of your jet ski 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:05.590
 Okay, basically we have a machine for 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:09.150
 clean nozzle lubricators we have 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:12.040
 battery chargers a tooling 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:15.579
 complete we have the computer to 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:17.770
 scan your central office where the 

00:01:15.579 --> 00:01:21.009
 log all errors all failures 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:23.290
 whether it is a sensor or a power nozzle 

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:25.470
 fuel pump pressure all 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:28.329
 this informed in our computers 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:30.610
 we are able to do review 

00:01:28.329 --> 00:01:34.119
 any jet ski brand 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:40.329
 because our computer our scanner 

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:44.290
 it is able to scan the 

00:01:40.329 --> 00:01:45.399
 kawasaki been and polar moors any 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:47.890
 jet ski brand 

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:49.869
 ok the only thing we have not and 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:53.110
 ready stocks are all accessories 

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:55.450
 and all parts for all brands 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:59.700
 this would be possible but we have 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:03.039
 always a great variety of pieces that 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.490
 minimizes jet repair time 

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:05.890
 ski 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:08.440
 but let's go to what matters in this video 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:09.430
 which is actually checked in a review 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:12.910
 OK 

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:16.989
 Look, basically, just let me tell you 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:19.300
 time this vision is made we are the 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:21.730
 manufacturer manufacturers general mode 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:24.430
 be the kawasaki brand 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:29.349
 afraid that the revisions will be made 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:31.209
 maximum of six months since pa 

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:32.319
 loss of lubrication quality 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:36.459
 eyes 

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:38.110
 the oil filter among other problems 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:40.810
 that can happen 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:44.650
 if it takes more than six months or 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:48.310
 another option is by the amount of hours it is 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:49.540
 with the project that basically 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:51.310
 You 're a gesture that was in us. 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:54.519
 united states with the quality of 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:56.950
 better fuel and all this 

00:02:54.519 --> 00:03:00.519
 review is made of 50 and 50 hours where 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:02.379
 six months of the Brazilian situation where 

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:05.230
 we have the addition of alcohol, what will 

00:03:02.379 --> 00:03:07.989
 helped in gasoline is a little lower 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:10.030
 really this review has to be done 

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:14.530
 of the earliest form that is exactly 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:17.680
 every six months or 25 and 25 years 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:20.290
 ok what is done in this review we 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:25.180
 check the expenses 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:28.690
 feel the turbine shaft bearing since 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:33.519
 the line of the motor shaft 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:34.450
 we check the battery level of 

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:39.880
 fluid 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:43.630
 we checked the borges quoted born 

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:45.340
 and automatically rusted 

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:46.359
 battery system has charged with the 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:48.010
 match 

00:03:46.359 --> 00:03:50.859
 this same farmhouse that we do in 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:53.980
 battery make the starter for 

00:03:50.859 --> 00:03:58.359
 check for any kind of fires 

00:03:53.980 --> 00:04:01.060
 and the action that generates a weak match 

00:03:58.359 --> 00:04:03.629
 in addition we checked the system of 

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:07.180
 cooling are blows 

00:04:03.629 --> 00:04:08.019
 the water capturing 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:10.419
 sea 

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:13.359
 in the case of the mooring it captures water from 

00:04:10.419 --> 00:04:15.669
 to cool the engine and water from the 

00:04:13.359 --> 00:04:19.959
 to cool the exhaust system 

00:04:15.669 --> 00:04:21.489
 in the case of the acid is that funding is 

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:23.080
 so simply for general and for 

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:26.349
 cool the exhaust 

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:27.250
 then this blackmail of 

00:04:26.349 --> 00:04:29.890
 goto top 

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:31.090
 In addition, we check the 

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:33.219
 motor 

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:34.360
 basically formerly were very 

00:04:33.219 --> 00:04:36.250
 break they broke 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:37.719
 very big facility today I'm more 

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:40.599
 tough but I still want 

00:04:37.719 --> 00:04:42.129
 if you skip waves if you use the 

00:04:40.599 --> 00:04:45.460
 objects that to the extreme 

00:04:42.129 --> 00:04:47.710
 These sent that chaos of the engine may come 

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:50.189
 drown or break 

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:54.099
 we do a system check 

00:04:50.189 --> 00:04:56.860
 electrical and general that are all 

00:04:54.099 --> 00:04:59.800
 b lashes the fitting recesses of 

00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:01.870
 nozzles of pump coils 

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:05.500
 fuel as I said on the 

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:08.050
 the battery panel from the 

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:10.689
 starting current cut it all ends 

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:13.689
 furthermore suggests that bce at any 

00:05:10.689 --> 00:05:16.870
 type of leakage is by some joint 

00:05:13.689 --> 00:05:19.629
 some return or burst 

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:21.279
 either wear it or because it 

00:05:19.629 --> 00:05:23.770
 you have checked to see if there 

00:05:21.279 --> 00:05:26.050
 leakage of oil or water 

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:30.550
 no matter any leakage beyond 

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:32.919
 In addition, we will lubricate the 

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:36.039
 direction cable dr 

00:05:32.919 --> 00:05:37.900
 this steering cable it has to 

00:05:36.039 --> 00:05:39.699
 work softly 

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:42.430
 if it is not if the subject is not 

00:05:39.699 --> 00:05:44.949
 because it was never amplified and then 

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:47.830
 we work automatically with jet 

00:05:44.949 --> 00:05:50.199
 ski in salt water in totally 

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:52.750
 adverse events if there was no 

00:05:50.199 --> 00:05:54.310
 it may break down and become 

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:57.240
 you will lose control of the 

00:05:54.310 --> 00:06:00.750
 projects that we exchange 

00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:02.740
 The oil and film are automatically obvious. 

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:06.129
 You see I put it there for the end. 

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:10.029
 really it is done but it is one of the last 

00:06:06.129 --> 00:06:13.180
 items to be done to replace it if 

00:06:10.029 --> 00:06:15.939
 your g1 is stored here in object a 

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:18.490
 our navy she already sprays with 

00:06:15.939 --> 00:06:21.580
 liquid petroleum jelly last season 

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:23.919
 each time it is given the dossier made 

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:26.500
 designs washing what if designs 

00:06:23.919 --> 00:06:29.110
 which is not stored here and is came here 

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:30.550
 to do review we spray up 

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:33.610
 for you to know how our 

00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:36.279
 work in addition to giving a general polish 

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:38.800
 It's a toast we give every time it's 

00:06:36.279 --> 00:06:41.110
 done a review of the rock project then 

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:43.149
 how can you really see our 

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:45.459
 work is serious work, it's a 

00:06:43.149 --> 00:06:48.169
 work with the commitment to 

00:06:45.459 --> 00:06:51.229
 quality and with safety then 

00:06:48.169 --> 00:06:53.090
 the way we conduct your business. 

00:06:51.229 --> 00:06:56.060
 review here on object 

00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:57.080
 Thank you very much for your attention and until the 

00:06:56.060 --> 00:06:59.860
 next contact 

00:06:57.080 --> 00:06:59.860
 a hug thanks
