00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:50.740 
all right now the next trick is actually

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:52.590 
all right now the next trick is actually
getting<00:01:50.979> into<00:01:51.100> it<00:01:51.340> like<00:01:51.820> I<00:01:51.970> said<00:01:52.149> before<00:01:52.450> you

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:52.600 
getting into it like I said before you

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:54.179 
getting into it like I said before you
need<00:01:52.689> a<00:01:52.750> ramp<00:01:52.930> that's<00:01:53.110> deep<00:01:53.350> enough<00:01:53.470> to<00:01:53.950> double

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:54.189 
need a ramp that's deep enough to double

00:01:54.189 --> 00:01:56.310 
need a ramp that's deep enough to double
peg<00:01:54.369> way<00:01:54.789> to<00:01:54.850> check<00:01:55.090> that<00:01:55.240> you<00:01:55.930> should<00:01:56.110> be<00:01:56.229> able

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:56.320 
peg way to check that you should be able

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:58.139 
peg way to check that you should be able
to<00:01:56.439> put<00:01:56.530> your<00:01:56.619> bike<00:01:56.799> in<00:01:56.829> and<00:01:57.189> have<00:01:57.850> at<00:01:58.090> least

to put your bike in and have at least
like<00:01:58.750> mid<00:01:58.990> peg<00:01:59.229> on<00:01:59.439> the<00:01:59.470> coping<00:01:59.909> because<00:02:00.909> like

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:01.060 
like mid peg on the coping because like

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:02.219 
like mid peg on the coping because like
if<00:02:01.180> you<00:02:01.270> can<00:02:01.390> only<00:02:01.479> get<00:02:01.630> that<00:02:01.750> much<00:02:01.960> in<00:02:02.110> you're

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:02.229 
if you can only get that much in you're

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:04.859 
if you can only get that much in you're
just<00:02:02.350> gonna<00:02:02.470> go<00:02:03.179> this<00:02:04.179> game's<00:02:04.390> perfect

00:02:04.859 --> 00:02:04.869

come up to the top of the ramp with a
decent<00:02:11.860> amount<00:02:11.920> of<00:02:12.099> speed<00:02:12.280> but<00:02:12.489> not<00:02:12.519> too<00:02:12.849> much

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
decent amount of speed but not too much

that looks like I know you're gonna do

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:26.580 
that looks like I know you're gonna do
this<00:02:24.370> maybe<00:02:25.360> one<00:02:25.840> of<00:02:25.870> you<00:02:25.989> guys<00:02:26.019> won't<00:02:26.380> but<00:02:26.560> I

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:26.590 
this maybe one of you guys won't but I

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:31.610 
this maybe one of you guys won't but I
know<00:02:26.680> you<00:02:26.799> are

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:35.280 

well<00:02:32.620> oh<00:02:32.860> hopefully<00:02:33.849> that<00:02:34.120> will<00:02:34.239> happen<00:02:34.569> but

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
well oh hopefully that will happen but

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:37.400 
well oh hopefully that will happen but
uh<00:02:35.349> yeah<00:02:36.130> if<00:02:36.190> that<00:02:36.340> happens<00:02:36.700> then<00:02:36.910> you're<00:02:37.060> just

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
uh yeah if that happens then you're just

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:43.580 
uh yeah if that happens then you're just
stupid

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:47.130 

so<00:02:44.590> yeah<00:02:44.830> like<00:02:45.660> that<00:02:46.660> just<00:02:46.840> means<00:02:47.020> you're

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:47.140 
so yeah like that just means you're

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:48.240 
so yeah like that just means you're
leaning<00:02:47.350> too<00:02:47.470> far<00:02:47.500> out<00:02:47.860> and<00:02:47.890> you're<00:02:48.070> going<00:02:48.190> a

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.250 
leaning too far out and you're going a

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:50.550 
leaning too far out and you're going a
little<00:02:48.340> too<00:02:48.460> fast<00:02:48.790> with<00:02:49.240> this<00:02:49.360> trick<00:02:49.600> if<00:02:50.260> most

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:50.560 
little too fast with this trick if most

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:52.320 
little too fast with this trick if most
you<00:02:50.650> guys<00:02:50.800> can<00:02:51.040> double<00:02:51.250> peg<00:02:51.430> like<00:02:51.580> a<00:02:51.640> box<00:02:51.970> or

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:52.330 
you guys can double peg like a box or

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:54.270 
you guys can double peg like a box or
like<00:02:52.510> a<00:02:52.540> rail<00:02:52.840> or<00:02:52.870> something<00:02:53.320> you'll<00:02:54.070> know

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:54.280 
like a rail or something you'll know

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.370 
like a rail or something you'll know
like<00:02:54.580> kind<00:02:54.790> of<00:02:54.880> how<00:02:54.940> to<00:02:54.970> do<00:02:55.180> it<00:02:55.300> and<00:02:55.990> actually

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:56.380 
like kind of how to do it and actually

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:58.560 
like kind of how to do it and actually
it's<00:02:56.530> really<00:02:56.770> similar<00:02:56.980> to<00:02:57.100> that<00:02:57.390> like<00:02:58.390> what<00:02:58.540> I

00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:58.570 
it's really similar to that like what I

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:01.170 
it's really similar to that like what I
recommend<00:02:59.050> to<00:02:59.140> learn<00:02:59.290> it<00:02:59.440> is<00:02:59.770> just<00:03:00.700> like<00:03:00.850> get

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:01.180 
recommend to learn it is just like get

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:03.120 
recommend to learn it is just like get
the<00:03:01.330> feel<00:03:01.570> if<00:03:01.780> you're<00:03:02.650> putting<00:03:02.890> your<00:03:03.010> foot

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:03.130 
the feel if you're putting your foot

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:04.260 
the feel if you're putting your foot
down<00:03:03.190> go<00:03:03.460> a<00:03:03.490> little<00:03:03.610> bit<00:03:03.790> slower<00:03:04.000> and<00:03:04.180> if

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:04.270 
down go a little bit slower and if

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:06.060 
down go a little bit slower and if
you're<00:03:04.390> still<00:03:04.570> putting<00:03:04.780> it<00:03:04.900> down<00:03:05.110> one<00:03:05.890> thing

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:06.070 
you're still putting it down one thing

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:07.890 
you're still putting it down one thing
you<00:03:06.160> could<00:03:06.280> try<00:03:06.400> to<00:03:06.490> do<00:03:06.700> you<00:03:07.510> can<00:03:07.660> put<00:03:07.780> your

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:07.900 
you could try to do you can put your

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:09.660 
you could try to do you can put your
front<00:03:08.050> pedal<00:03:08.350> down<00:03:08.470> it's<00:03:09.070> kind<00:03:09.250> of<00:03:09.340> cheating

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:09.670 
front pedal down it's kind of cheating

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:11.400 
front pedal down it's kind of cheating
but<00:03:10.480> you<00:03:10.600> know<00:03:10.720> it'll<00:03:10.870> help<00:03:11.050> you<00:03:11.170> get<00:03:11.320> that

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:11.410 
but you know it'll help you get that

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:13.470 
but you know it'll help you get that
balance<00:03:11.800> before<00:03:11.920> you<00:03:12.130> tip<00:03:12.280> over<00:03:12.480> actually

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:13.480 
balance before you tip over actually

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:14.700 
balance before you tip over actually
what<00:03:13.570> I<00:03:13.630> do<00:03:13.690> sometimes<00:03:13.990> if<00:03:14.320> I'm<00:03:14.440> doing<00:03:14.680> that

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:14.710 
what I do sometimes if I'm doing that

I can keep my weight over the ramp but

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:22.140 
I can keep my weight over the ramp but
really<00:03:20.350> the<00:03:20.440> key<00:03:20.590> to<00:03:20.770> it<00:03:20.890> is<00:03:21.100> keeping<00:03:21.880> all<00:03:22.120> your

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:22.150 
really the key to it is keeping all your

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:25.320 
really the key to it is keeping all your
weight<00:03:22.510> in<00:03:23.380> the<00:03:23.620> ramp<00:03:23.860> while<00:03:24.730> your<00:03:24.910> arms<00:03:25.180> are

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:25.330 
weight in the ramp while your arms are

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:26.850 
weight in the ramp while your arms are
out<00:03:25.480> I<00:03:25.660> can't<00:03:25.930> really<00:03:26.050> say<00:03:26.350> here<00:03:26.530> like<00:03:26.710> that

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:26.860 
out I can't really say here like that

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:29.640 
out I can't really say here like that
but<00:03:27.430> when<00:03:27.550> I<00:03:27.580> do<00:03:27.700> a<00:03:27.790> few<00:03:27.940> you'll<00:03:28.240> see<00:03:28.650> it's

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:29.650 
but when I do a few you'll see it's

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:31.470 
but when I do a few you'll see it's
almost<00:03:29.890> like<00:03:30.130> you're<00:03:31.060> still<00:03:31.240> having<00:03:31.420> a

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:31.480 
almost like you're still having a

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:33.150 
almost like you're still having a
problem<00:03:31.540> with<00:03:31.750> going<00:03:31.900> too<00:03:32.050> fast<00:03:32.230> try<00:03:32.950> to<00:03:33.010> go

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:33.160 
problem with going too fast try to go

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:34.470 
problem with going too fast try to go
slow<00:03:33.490> on<00:03:33.520> the<00:03:33.700> ramp<00:03:33.820> and<00:03:34.000> literally<00:03:34.240> like

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:34.480 
slow on the ramp and literally like

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:36.750 
slow on the ramp and literally like
bunny<00:03:34.870> hawk<00:03:35.110> up<00:03:35.650> to<00:03:35.950> the<00:03:36.040> coping<00:03:36.370> and<00:03:36.520> land

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:36.760 
bunny hawk up to the coping and land

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:38.670 
bunny hawk up to the coping and land
like<00:03:36.910> going<00:03:37.300> down<00:03:37.810> in<00:03:38.020> it<00:03:38.140> instead<00:03:38.290> of<00:03:38.500> like

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:38.680 
like going down in it instead of like

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:40.710 
like going down in it instead of like
going<00:03:38.800> out<00:03:39.090> then<00:03:40.090> you<00:03:40.150> go<00:03:40.270> out<00:03:40.450> you're<00:03:40.600> gonna

and went down a little that was just me

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:05.490 
and went down a little that was just me
checking<00:04:03.610> my<00:04:03.730> speed<00:04:03.970> so<00:04:04.810> again<00:04:05.110> this<00:04:05.230> tricks

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:05.500 
checking my speed so again this tricks

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:07.920 
checking my speed so again this tricks
pretty<00:04:05.739> basic<00:04:05.950> and<00:04:06.340> you<00:04:07.150> know<00:04:07.270> it's<00:04:07.599> not<00:04:07.750> too

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:07.930 
pretty basic and you know it's not too

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:09.449 
pretty basic and you know it's not too
hard<00:04:08.110> to<00:04:08.200> get<00:04:08.319> hurt<00:04:08.530> but<00:04:08.890> it<00:04:09.040> will<00:04:09.220> get

00:04:09.449 --> 00:04:09.459 
hard to get hurt but it will get

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:10.530 
hard to get hurt but it will get
frustrating<00:04:10.030> when<00:04:10.150> you're<00:04:10.270> trying<00:04:10.420> to

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:10.540 
frustrating when you're trying to

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:15.160 
like I said that happened up just go

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:16.860 
like I said that happened up just go
slower<00:04:15.459> than<00:04:15.700> you<00:04:15.760> think<00:04:15.940> I<00:04:16.180> mean<00:04:16.660> the<00:04:16.750> worst

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:16.870 
slower than you think I mean the worst

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:17.849 
slower than you think I mean the worst
thing<00:04:17.019> that's<00:04:17.200> going<00:04:17.350> to<00:04:17.410> happen<00:04:17.530> is<00:04:17.769> you're

00:04:17.849 --> 00:04:17.859 
thing that's going to happen is you're

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:19.349 
thing that's going to happen is you're
going<00:04:17.950> to<00:04:18.010> miss<00:04:18.190> your<00:04:18.220> back<00:04:18.459> peg<00:04:18.700> and<00:04:19.299> you

00:04:19.349 --> 00:04:19.359 
going to miss your back peg and you

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:20.479 
going to miss your back peg and you
might<00:04:19.570> slide<00:04:19.780> out<00:04:19.810> down<00:04:20.079> the<00:04:20.169> ramp<00:04:20.320> a<00:04:20.410> little

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:20.489 
might slide out down the ramp a little

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:23.370 
might slide out down the ramp a little
might<00:04:21.489> get<00:04:21.639> a<00:04:21.669> few<00:04:21.820> little<00:04:21.940> scrapes<00:04:22.330> I'm<00:04:23.200> not

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:23.380 
might get a few little scrapes I'm not

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:24.540 
might get a few little scrapes I'm not
going<00:04:23.530> to<00:04:23.590> call<00:04:23.710> you<00:04:24.100> if<00:04:24.220> you<00:04:24.310> are<00:04:24.430> elbow

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:24.550 
going to call you if you are elbow

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:25.830 
going to call you if you are elbow
pads<00:04:24.820> because<00:04:25.030> I<00:04:25.150> did<00:04:25.330> what<00:04:25.450> I<00:04:25.510> learned<00:04:25.720> them

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:25.840 
pads because I did what I learned them

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:29.490 
pads because I did what I learned them
but<00:04:26.560> uh<00:04:27.060> yeah<00:04:28.060> um<00:04:28.330> the<00:04:28.810> smaller<00:04:29.080> the<00:04:29.260> ramp<00:04:29.410> the

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:29.500 
but uh yeah um the smaller the ramp the

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:30.990 
but uh yeah um the smaller the ramp the
harder<00:04:29.740> it's<00:04:29.830> going<00:04:29.919> to<00:04:29.980> be<00:04:30.040> if<00:04:30.790> you<00:04:30.850> have<00:04:30.940> a

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:31.000 
harder it's going to be if you have a

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.430 
harder it's going to be if you have a
bigger<00:04:31.210> ramp<00:04:31.419> it'll<00:04:31.600> be<00:04:31.720> easier<00:04:32.020> but<00:04:32.200> again

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:32.440 
bigger ramp it'll be easier but again

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:33.360 
bigger ramp it'll be easier but again
you're<00:04:32.560> gonna<00:04:32.620> have<00:04:32.710> that<00:04:32.830> problem<00:04:32.979> taking

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:33.370 
you're gonna have that problem taking

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:36.000 
you're gonna have that problem taking
your<00:04:33.460> foot<00:04:33.550> off<00:04:33.700> so<00:04:34.389> the<00:04:34.450> trick<00:04:34.660> is<00:04:34.690> just<00:04:35.010> arms

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:36.010 
your foot off so the trick is just arms

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:38.520 
your foot off so the trick is just arms
out<00:04:36.190> all<00:04:36.400> your<00:04:36.669> body<00:04:36.850> weight<00:04:37.060> in<00:04:37.240> and<00:04:37.720> if<00:04:38.380> you

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:38.530 
out all your body weight in and if you

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:40.320 
out all your body weight in and if you
can<00:04:38.680> already<00:04:38.830> double<00:04:39.160> peg<00:04:39.370> on<00:04:39.760> a<00:04:39.820> quarter<00:04:40.150> and

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:40.330 
can already double peg on a quarter and

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:41.909 
can already double peg on a quarter and
you<00:04:40.780> want<00:04:40.960> to<00:04:41.050> work<00:04:41.320> on<00:04:41.440> something<00:04:41.650> else<00:04:41.770> and

00:04:41.909 --> 00:04:41.919 
you want to work on something else and

00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:43.980 
you want to work on something else and
you<00:04:42.040> want<00:04:42.130> to<00:04:42.250> try<00:04:42.370> just<00:04:42.479> double<00:04:43.479> peg<00:04:43.630> grinds

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:43.990 
you want to try just double peg grinds

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:45.570 
you want to try just double peg grinds
it's<00:04:44.740> hard<00:04:44.919> to<00:04:45.010> show<00:04:45.130> you<00:04:45.190> on<00:04:45.280> this<00:04:45.340> ramp

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:45.580 
it's hard to show you on this ramp

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:47.700 
it's hard to show you on this ramp
because<00:04:45.669> like<00:04:46.000> it<00:04:46.870> catches<00:04:47.169> a<00:04:47.200> wood<00:04:47.440> but<00:04:47.680> uh

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:47.710 
because like it catches a wood but uh

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:49.469 
because like it catches a wood but uh
basically<00:04:48.370> it's<00:04:48.820> the<00:04:48.940> same<00:04:49.090> exact<00:04:49.419> thing

00:04:49.469 --> 00:04:49.479 
basically it's the same exact thing

00:04:49.479 --> 00:04:51.180 
basically it's the same exact thing
except<00:04:50.200> when<00:04:50.290> you're<00:04:50.410> going<00:04:50.530> into<00:04:50.770> it<00:04:50.889> try<00:04:51.130> to

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:51.190 
except when you're going into it try to

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:52.440 
except when you're going into it try to
go<00:04:51.370> a<00:04:51.400> little<00:04:51.580> more<00:04:51.700> parallel<00:04:52.240> with<00:04:52.360> the

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:52.450 
go a little more parallel with the

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:54.990 
go a little more parallel with the
coping<00:04:52.780> and<00:04:53.100> hold<00:04:54.100> your<00:04:54.280> arms<00:04:54.520> out<00:04:54.610> even<00:04:54.970> more

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:55.000 
coping and hold your arms out even more

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.580 
coping and hold your arms out even more
so<00:04:55.330> still<00:04:55.570> your<00:04:55.720> body<00:04:55.840> weights<00:04:56.139> in<00:04:56.290> the<00:04:56.380> ramp

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:56.590 
so still your body weights in the ramp

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:58.379 
so still your body weights in the ramp
because<00:04:57.190> what<00:04:57.340> you<00:04:57.400> actually<00:04:57.430> want<00:04:57.940> to<00:04:58.000> do<00:04:58.180> is

00:04:58.379 --> 00:04:58.389 
because what you actually want to do is

00:04:58.389 --> 00:05:00.750 
because what you actually want to do is
it's<00:04:59.229> not<00:04:59.380> all<00:04:59.590> grind<00:04:59.889> sometimes<00:05:00.370> your<00:05:00.520> tires

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:00.760 
it's not all grind sometimes your tires

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:02.219 
it's not all grind sometimes your tires
will<00:05:01.030> touch<00:05:01.180> the<00:05:01.300> ramp<00:05:01.450> and<00:05:01.870> what<00:05:02.020> kind<00:05:02.169> of

00:05:02.219 --> 00:05:02.229 
will touch the ramp and what kind of

00:05:02.229 --> 00:05:04.740 
will touch the ramp and what kind of
roll<00:05:02.440> out<00:05:02.680> it's<00:05:03.190> like<00:05:03.280> if<00:05:03.460> you<00:05:03.580> come<00:05:03.729> up<00:05:03.850> watch

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:04.750 
roll out it's like if you come up watch

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:19.130 
roll out it's like if you come up watch
you'll<00:05:04.960> get<00:05:05.140> a<00:05:05.169> feel<00:05:05.380> for<00:05:05.410> it

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:19.140 

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:21.900
