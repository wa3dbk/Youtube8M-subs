question you know will madden 16 respect
you<00:00:34.589> know<00:00:34.739> momentum<00:00:35.370> and<00:00:35.550> wait<00:00:35.790> a<00:00:36.089> little

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:36.659 
you know momentum and wait a little

00:00:36.659 --> 00:00:38.299 
you know momentum and wait a little
better<00:00:36.960> than<00:00:37.170> it<00:00:37.260> did<00:00:37.409> well<00:00:37.710> i<00:00:37.739> would<00:00:38.040> like<00:00:38.190> to

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
better than it did well i would like to

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.399 
better than it did well i would like to
say<00:00:38.460> a<00:00:38.489> lot<00:00:38.699> better<00:00:38.940> than<00:00:39.210> it<00:00:39.239> does<00:00:39.510> currently

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:40.409 
say a lot better than it does currently

00:00:40.409 --> 00:00:42.439 
say a lot better than it does currently
with<00:00:40.559> the<00:00:40.680> infinity<00:00:41.159> engine<00:00:41.370> you<00:00:42.120> know<00:00:42.210> will

00:00:42.439 --> 00:00:42.449 
with the infinity engine you know will

00:00:42.449 --> 00:00:44.960 
with the infinity engine you know will
it<00:00:42.540> be<00:00:42.690> more<00:00:42.960> of<00:00:43.260> a<00:00:43.680> physical<00:00:44.010> presence

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:44.970 
it be more of a physical presence

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:48.410 
it be more of a physical presence
including<00:00:46.250> weight<00:00:47.250> and<00:00:47.519> momentum<00:00:48.089> of<00:00:48.239> things

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
including weight and momentum of things

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.540 
including weight and momentum of things
of<00:00:48.600> that<00:00:48.720> nature<00:00:48.800> all<00:00:49.800> right<00:00:50.039> so<00:00:50.190> let's<00:00:50.280> take<00:00:50.489> a

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
of that nature all right so let's take a

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.430 
of that nature all right so let's take a
look<00:00:50.850> at<00:00:50.910> what<00:00:50.969> i'm<00:00:51.179> talking<00:00:51.539> about<00:00:51.600> here<00:00:51.989> with

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
look at what i'm talking about here with

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.040 
look at what i'm talking about here with
the<00:00:52.590> example<00:00:53.100> here<00:00:53.309> in<00:00:53.399> this<00:00:53.519> video<00:00:53.879> all<00:00:54.870> right

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
the example here in this video all right

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.660 
the example here in this video all right
now<00:00:55.199> as<00:00:55.320> you<00:00:55.500> can<00:00:55.620> see<00:00:55.679> here<00:00:56.070> you<00:00:56.190> got<00:00:56.339> to<00:00:56.460> see

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
now as you can see here you got to see

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.410 
now as you can see here you got to see
running<00:00:57.600> back<00:00:57.780> you<00:00:58.500> know<00:00:58.679> he<00:00:58.859> runs<00:00:59.129> into

00:00:59.410 --> 00:00:59.420 
running back you know he runs into

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:02.119 
running back you know he runs into
uncommon<00:01:00.420> defendant<00:01:01.019> and<00:01:01.679> what<00:01:01.949> that

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
uncommon defendant and what that

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.160 
uncommon defendant and what that
defended<00:01:02.670> basically<00:01:03.239> you<00:01:03.660> know<00:01:03.749> he<00:01:03.870> kind<00:01:04.080> of

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
defended basically you know he kind of

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.680 
defended basically you know he kind of
bounces<00:01:04.649> off<00:01:04.830> and<00:01:05.100> it<00:01:05.970> looks<00:01:06.210> pretty

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:06.690 
bounces off and it looks pretty

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:08.749 
bounces off and it looks pretty
realistic<00:01:07.050> in<00:01:07.470> my<00:01:07.619> opinion<00:01:07.950> as<00:01:08.160> far<00:01:08.399> as<00:01:08.550> what

00:01:08.749 --> 00:01:08.759 
realistic in my opinion as far as what

00:01:08.759 --> 00:01:11.450 
realistic in my opinion as far as what
could<00:01:09.060> happen<00:01:09.330> you<00:01:10.289> know<00:01:10.409> it<00:01:10.679> always<00:01:10.950> going<00:01:11.399> to

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
could happen you know it always going to

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.330 
could happen you know it always going to
be<00:01:11.490> questionable<00:01:12.030> about<00:01:12.770> you<00:01:13.770> know<00:01:13.890> how<00:01:14.070> often

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
be questionable about you know how often

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.370 
be questionable about you know how often
something<00:01:14.759> like<00:01:15.000> this<00:01:15.119> would<00:01:15.300> happen<00:01:15.380> what

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
something like this would happen what

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.710 
something like this would happen what
factors<00:01:16.920> will<00:01:17.069> determine<00:01:17.610> it<00:01:17.759> but<00:01:18.300> as<00:01:18.390> you<00:01:18.600> can

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
factors will determine it but as you can

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.990 
factors will determine it but as you can
see<00:01:18.960> here<00:01:19.259> you<00:01:19.950> know<00:01:20.039> it<00:01:20.130> definitely<00:01:20.369> looks

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
see here you know it definitely looks

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.270 
see here you know it definitely looks
like<00:01:21.119> something<00:01:21.270> that<00:01:21.720> could<00:01:22.079> happen<00:01:22.409> you

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
like something that could happen you

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:24.740 
like something that could happen you
know<00:01:23.430> he<00:01:23.640> leased<00:01:23.909> his<00:01:24.000> guy<00:01:24.270> at<00:01:24.420> the<00:01:24.540> line<00:01:24.720> of

something like that happening so the
point<00:01:57.689> that<00:01:57.810> i<00:01:57.930> want<00:01:57.960> to<00:01:58.229> make<00:01:58.409> in<00:01:58.619> this<00:01:58.740> video

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
point that i want to make in this video

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.179 
point that i want to make in this video
is<00:01:59.430> basically<00:02:00.149> you<00:02:01.109> know<00:02:01.229> will<00:02:01.530> we<00:02:01.710> see<00:02:01.979> this

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
is basically you know will we see this

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:05.240 
is basically you know will we see this
more<00:02:02.729> in<00:02:03.030> madden<00:02:03.420> 16<00:02:03.600> will<00:02:04.590> the<00:02:04.770> physical

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
more in madden 16 will the physical

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.419 
more in madden 16 will the physical
aspect<00:02:05.820> be<00:02:06.420> more<00:02:06.719> prevalent<00:02:07.020> you<00:02:07.920> know<00:02:08.070> as<00:02:08.190> far

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
aspect be more prevalent you know as far

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:11.240 
aspect be more prevalent you know as far
as<00:02:08.609> the<00:02:08.940> players<00:02:09.329> wait<00:02:09.600> in<00:02:09.840> his<00:02:10.350> momentum<00:02:10.979> and

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
as the players wait in his momentum and

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.370 
as the players wait in his momentum and
things<00:02:11.579> of<00:02:11.760> that<00:02:11.790> nature<00:02:11.910> cuz<00:02:12.660> i<00:02:12.780> feel<00:02:13.049> like<00:02:13.200> as

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
things of that nature cuz i feel like as

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.979 
things of that nature cuz i feel like as
long<00:02:13.410> as<00:02:13.799> we're<00:02:14.010> progressing<00:02:14.540> the<00:02:15.540> physics

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:15.989 
long as we're progressing the physics

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:18.440 
long as we're progressing the physics
engine<00:02:16.170> and<00:02:16.650> as<00:02:17.220> long<00:02:17.400> as<00:02:17.640> games<00:02:17.910> are<00:02:18.090> moving

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
engine and as long as games are moving

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:19.940 
engine and as long as games are moving
towards<00:02:18.930> more<00:02:19.109> of<00:02:19.230> a<00:02:19.260> physical<00:02:19.470> presence

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
towards more of a physical presence

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:22.759 
towards more of a physical presence
these<00:02:20.850> things<00:02:21.180> have<00:02:21.420> to<00:02:21.570> matter<00:02:21.810> because<00:02:22.739> of

00:02:22.759 --> 00:02:22.769 
these things have to matter because of

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:25.580 
these things have to matter because of
these<00:02:22.980> things<00:02:23.340> don't<00:02:23.730> matter<00:02:24.060> then<00:02:24.900> you<00:02:25.470> know

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
these things don't matter then you know

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:27.409 
these things don't matter then you know
if<00:02:25.709> it's<00:02:25.859> always<00:02:26.310> somewhat<00:02:26.970> of<00:02:27.090> a<00:02:27.180> scripted

00:02:27.409 --> 00:02:27.419 
if it's always somewhat of a scripted

00:02:27.419 --> 00:02:29.509 
if it's always somewhat of a scripted
sequence<00:02:28.109> we're<00:02:28.709> not<00:02:28.859> really<00:02:29.070> going<00:02:29.250> to<00:02:29.310> get

00:02:29.509 --> 00:02:29.519 
sequence we're not really going to get

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:29.820 
sequence we're not really going to get
the

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:29.830 
the

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:31.440 
the
I<00:02:29.860> have<00:02:30.040> a<00:02:30.070> physical<00:02:30.520> game<00:02:30.940> that<00:02:31.180> we<00:02:31.300> are

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.450 
I have a physical game that we are

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:34.350 
I have a physical game that we are
designed<00:02:31.900> so<00:02:32.890> these<00:02:33.100> things<00:02:33.460> have<00:02:33.850> to<00:02:33.880> work

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:34.360 
designed so these things have to work

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:36.360 
designed so these things have to work
and<00:02:34.630> they<00:02:34.720> have<00:02:34.930> to<00:02:35.110> play<00:02:35.260> out<00:02:35.530> you<00:02:36.100> know<00:02:36.250> the

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:36.370 
and they have to play out you know the

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:38.070 
and they have to play out you know the
way<00:02:36.520> we<00:02:36.730> want<00:02:36.940> them<00:02:36.970> to<00:02:37.060> play<00:02:37.240> out<00:02:37.510> so<00:02:37.780> again

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:38.080 
way we want them to play out so again

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:39.900 
way we want them to play out so again
you<00:02:38.590> know<00:02:38.710> you<00:02:38.770> looking<00:02:39.130> at<00:02:39.250> this<00:02:39.370> interaction

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:39.910 
you know you looking at this interaction

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:44.100 
you know you looking at this interaction
here<00:02:40.300> once<00:02:40.960> again<00:02:41.280> you<00:02:42.280> don't<00:02:42.630> he<00:02:43.630> bumps<00:02:44.020> into

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:44.110 
here once again you don't he bumps into

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:46.650 
here once again you don't he bumps into
noise<00:02:44.530> 10<00:02:44.830> minutes<00:02:45.070> bounces<00:02:45.490> off<00:02:45.670> to<00:02:45.820> him<00:02:46.030> kind

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:46.660 
noise 10 minutes bounces off to him kind

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:48.360 
noise 10 minutes bounces off to him kind
of<00:02:46.750> bounces<00:02:47.230> off<00:02:47.380> for<00:02:47.560> the<00:02:47.650> next<00:02:47.830> one<00:02:48.130> coming

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:48.370 
of bounces off for the next one coming

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:51.540 
of bounces off for the next one coming
tackler<00:02:48.940> and<00:02:49.480> then<00:02:49.720> of<00:02:50.320> course<00:02:50.380> Mike<00:02:51.310> Mitchell

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:51.550 
tackler and then of course Mike Mitchell

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:54.180 
tackler and then of course Mike Mitchell
is<00:02:51.820> able<00:02:52.090> to<00:02:52.180> get<00:02:52.330> him<00:02:52.510> down<00:02:52.750> in<00:02:53.380> the<00:02:53.650> last<00:02:53.860> play

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:54.190 
is able to get him down in the last play

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:56.250 
is able to get him down in the last play
well<00:02:54.760> the<00:02:54.940> last<00:02:55.120> you<00:02:55.480> know<00:02:55.510> interaction<00:02:56.200> of

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:56.260 
well the last you know interaction of

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.470 
well the last you know interaction of
the<00:02:56.380> plate<00:02:56.620> so<00:02:56.830> like<00:02:56.980> I<00:02:57.010> said<00:02:57.190> man<00:02:57.700> you<00:02:57.940> know

00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:58.480 
the plate so like I said man you know

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:00.110 
the plate so like I said man you know
this<00:02:58.720> is<00:02:58.900> something<00:02:59.110> to<00:02:59.350> me<00:02:59.530> that<00:02:59.560> looks<00:02:59.980> very

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
this is something to me that looks very

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.640 
this is something to me that looks very
possible<00:03:01.120> this<00:03:01.840> is<00:03:02.050> something<00:03:02.410> that<00:03:02.440> you

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:02.650 
possible this is something that you

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:04.080 
possible this is something that you
definitely<00:03:02.860> would<00:03:03.280> be<00:03:03.430> able<00:03:03.610> to<00:03:03.700> see<00:03:03.880> on<00:03:04.060> a

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:04.090 
definitely would be able to see on a

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:07.949 
definitely would be able to see on a
Sunday<00:03:04.570> and<00:03:05.820> if<00:03:06.820> we<00:03:06.880> want<00:03:07.270> the<00:03:07.360> game<00:03:07.540> to<00:03:07.570> get<00:03:07.930> to

00:03:07.949 --> 00:03:07.959 
Sunday and if we want the game to get to

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:10.170 
Sunday and if we want the game to get to
that<00:03:08.170> point<00:03:08.550> that's<00:03:09.550> what<00:03:09.760> we're<00:03:09.880> gonna<00:03:10.000> have

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:10.180 
that point that's what we're gonna have

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:13.050 
that point that's what we're gonna have
to<00:03:10.330> move<00:03:10.510> towards<00:03:11.160> all<00:03:12.160> right<00:03:12.400> guys<00:03:12.610> so<00:03:12.880> that's

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:13.060 
to move towards all right guys so that's

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:15.080 
to move towards all right guys so that's
all<00:03:13.240> I<00:03:13.270> got<00:03:13.570> for<00:03:13.780> you<00:03:13.840> today<00:03:13.959> and<00:03:14.440> like<00:03:14.590> I<00:03:14.620> said

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
all I got for you today and like I said

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:19.530 
all I got for you today and like I said
the<00:03:16.090> question<00:03:16.570> remains<00:03:17.100> will<00:03:18.100> the<00:03:18.970> physics

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:19.540 
the question remains will the physics

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:22.860 
the question remains will the physics
will<00:03:20.320> match<00:03:20.560> 16<00:03:21.130> you<00:03:22.090> know<00:03:22.209> respective

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:22.870 
will match 16 you know respective

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:25.320 
will match 16 you know respective
physical<00:03:23.430> aspect<00:03:24.430> of<00:03:24.550> the<00:03:24.640> game<00:03:24.670> a<00:03:25.090> little

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:25.330
