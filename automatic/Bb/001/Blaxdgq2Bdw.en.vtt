and then a vinyl frame glass block
window<00:00:07.049> the<00:00:07.470> unframed<00:00:08.130> windows<00:00:08.550> can<00:00:08.910> be<00:00:08.940> built

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:09.269 
window the unframed windows can be built

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:12.020 
window the unframed windows can be built

either using mortar and put put together
with<00:00:12.210> mortar<00:00:12.570> or<00:00:12.750> they<00:00:13.559> can<00:00:13.740> be<00:00:13.860> silicone

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
with mortar or they can be silicone

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:17.750 
with mortar or they can be silicone
together<00:00:14.759> or<00:00:15.750> lastly<00:00:16.440> they<00:00:16.590> can<00:00:16.770> be<00:00:16.920> put

together<00:00:17.910> with<00:00:18.180> a<00:00:18.330> system<00:00:18.750> called<00:00:18.779> vinyl

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
together with a system called vinyl

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.830 
together with a system called vinyl
stack<00:00:19.830> and<00:00:20.160> vinyl<00:00:20.430> stacked<00:00:20.699> on<00:00:20.970> vinyl<00:00:21.300> members

additional strength to the window and
what's<00:00:29.310> nice<00:00:29.490> about<00:00:29.550> that<00:00:29.910> system<00:00:30.240> is<00:00:30.420> because

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
what's nice about that system is because

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.389 
what's nice about that system is because
of<00:00:30.840> these<00:00:30.960> vinyl<00:00:31.260> sections<00:00:32.099> that<00:00:32.160> are<00:00:32.219> put

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
of these vinyl sections that are put

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.490 
of these vinyl sections that are put
together<00:00:32.489> and<00:00:32.850> silicone<00:00:33.300> together<00:00:33.630> those

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
together and silicone together those

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.410 
together and silicone together those
unframed<00:00:35.219> windows<00:00:35.550> with<00:00:35.700> the<00:00:35.790> vinyl<00:00:36.059> stack

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
unframed windows with the vinyl stack

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.510 
unframed windows with the vinyl stack
can<00:00:36.989> be<00:00:37.200> literally<00:00:37.559> shipped<00:00:38.010> across<00:00:38.190> the

with<00:02:20.160> with<00:02:21.060> a<00:02:21.270> larger<00:02:21.720> thicker<00:02:22.020> glass<00:02:22.320> block

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
with with a larger thicker glass block

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:25.550 
with with a larger thicker glass block
now<00:02:23.580> with<00:02:23.760> the<00:02:23.880> advent<00:02:24.270> of<00:02:24.450> the<00:02:24.960> 2<00:02:25.290> inch<00:02:25.470> thick

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
now with the advent of the 2 inch thick

glass block that window may weigh about
105<00:02:28.740> pounds<00:02:28.980> so<00:02:29.250> it's<00:02:29.400> a<00:02:29.460> lot<00:02:29.670> easier<00:02:29.970> for<00:02:30.660> a

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
105 pounds so it's a lot easier for a

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.590 
105 pounds so it's a lot easier for a
homeowner<00:02:31.800> or<00:02:32.150> do-it-yourselfer<00:02:33.150> to<00:02:33.270> do<00:02:33.390> that

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
project so that thickness of the block

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:44.309 
project so that thickness of the block
has<00:02:36.270> really<00:02:36.540> helped<00:02:36.780> out

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:47.309 

now<00:02:45.319> the<00:02:45.379> advantage<00:02:46.189> of<00:02:46.310> the<00:02:46.430> acrylic<00:02:46.760> block

now the advantage of the acrylic block

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:49.780 
now the advantage of the acrylic block
in<00:02:48.319> addition<00:02:48.769> to<00:02:48.829> the<00:02:48.920> glass<00:02:49.099> block<00:02:49.340> is<00:02:49.549> it's
