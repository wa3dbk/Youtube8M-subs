00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:34.440 
over the retention clips of the memory

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:36.440 
over the retention clips of the memory
modules<00:01:34.830> and<00:01:35.100> then<00:01:35.790> we<00:01:35.850> can<00:01:35.970> adjust<00:01:36.090> the

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
modules and then we can adjust the

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.120 
modules and then we can adjust the
position<00:01:36.600> of<00:01:36.960> the<00:01:37.080> fan<00:01:37.290> block<00:01:37.530> to<00:01:37.740> best<00:01:37.950> suit

position of the fan block to best suit
our<00:01:38.370> needs<00:01:38.480> then<00:01:39.480> we<00:01:39.870> simply<00:01:40.290> further<00:01:40.560> tighten

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
our needs then we simply further tighten

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.160 
our needs then we simply further tighten
the<00:01:41.250> thumbscrews<00:01:41.940> that<00:01:42.150> we<00:01:42.270> left<00:01:42.480> previously

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
the thumbscrews that we left previously

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:44.960 
the thumbscrews that we left previously
a<00:01:43.200> little<00:01:43.530> bit<00:01:43.650> loose<00:01:43.860> so<00:01:44.490> that<00:01:44.520> we<00:01:44.730> can<00:01:44.880> adjust

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
a little bit loose so that we can adjust

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.300 
a little bit loose so that we can adjust
during<00:01:45.720> the<00:01:45.840> installation<00:01:46.110> process<00:01:46.560> and

the<00:02:17.900> temperature<00:02:18.500> was<00:02:18.710> recorded<00:02:19.070> at<00:02:19.430> 29

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:20.120 
the temperature was recorded at 29

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:23.020 
the temperature was recorded at 29
degrees<00:02:20.480> and<00:02:20.750> with<00:02:21.680> load<00:02:21.980> the<00:02:22.580> temperature

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.030 
degrees and with load the temperature

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:25.240 
degrees and with load the temperature
was<00:02:23.180> still<00:02:23.450> 29<00:02:24.260> degrees<00:02:24.650> so<00:02:25.220> that

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:25.250 
was still 29 degrees so that

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:27.520 
was still 29 degrees so that
demonstrates<00:02:25.910> that<00:02:26.030> with<00:02:26.720> or<00:02:26.990> without<00:02:27.200> the

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:27.530 
demonstrates that with or without the

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:28.840 
demonstrates that with or without the
cooler<00:02:27.770> there<00:02:28.100> is<00:02:28.220> quite<00:02:28.520> a<00:02:28.550> bit<00:02:28.760> of

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:28.850 
cooler there is quite a bit of

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:30.400 
cooler there is quite a bit of
difference<00:02:29.210> and<00:02:29.420> the<00:02:29.720> cooler<00:02:29.930> is<00:02:30.110> doing<00:02:30.350> a

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:30.410 
difference and the cooler is doing a

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:32.110 
difference and the cooler is doing a
good<00:02:30.530> job<00:02:30.590> it's<00:02:30.980> keeping<00:02:31.220> the<00:02:31.460> temperature

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.120 
good job it's keeping the temperature

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:34.030 
good job it's keeping the temperature
quite<00:02:32.750> near<00:02:32.960> the<00:02:32.990> room<00:02:33.290> temperature<00:02:33.470> just

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:34.040 
quite near the room temperature just

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:36.130 
quite near the room temperature just
four<00:02:34.640> degrees<00:02:34.760> separate<00:02:35.240> and<00:02:35.450> even<00:02:35.780> in<00:02:35.900> load

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:36.140 
four degrees separate and even in load

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:37.870 
four degrees separate and even in load
conditions<00:02:36.590> the<00:02:36.830> temperature<00:02:37.280> still<00:02:37.490> go<00:02:37.700> up

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:37.880 
conditions the temperature still go up

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:39.850 
conditions the temperature still go up
which<00:02:38.150> was<00:02:38.390> expected<00:02:38.750> to<00:02:38.930> go<00:02:39.140> up<00:02:39.170> and<00:02:39.560> it<00:02:39.710> was

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:39.860 
which was expected to go up and it was

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:42.580 
which was expected to go up and it was
very<00:02:40.010> very<00:02:40.160> quiet<00:02:40.580> all<00:02:40.790> along<00:02:41.060> so<00:02:41.780> this<00:02:42.290> may<00:02:42.560> be

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:42.590 
very very quiet all along so this may be

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:44.950 
very very quiet all along so this may be
appealing<00:02:43.310> to<00:02:43.460> enthusiasts<00:02:44.450> who<00:02:44.570> don't<00:02:44.780> want

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:44.960 
appealing to enthusiasts who don't want

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:47.020 
appealing to enthusiasts who don't want
to<00:02:45.110> leave<00:02:45.230> anything<00:02:45.500> on<00:02:45.740> chance<00:02:46.010> cooling<00:02:46.940> the

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:47.030 
to leave anything on chance cooling the

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:49.510 
to leave anything on chance cooling the
memory<00:02:47.330> can<00:02:47.810> be<00:02:48.110> the<00:02:48.230> difference<00:02:48.320> and<00:02:48.800> this

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:49.520 
memory can be the difference and this

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:51.570 
memory can be the difference and this
product<00:02:50.120> seems<00:02:50.270> to<00:02:50.420> do<00:02:50.540> that<00:02:50.690> job<00:02:50.840> quite<00:02:51.170> well

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:51.580 
product seems to do that job quite well

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:53.830 
product seems to do that job quite well
