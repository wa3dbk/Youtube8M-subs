00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:10.100
 ah 

00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:13.100
 [Music] 

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:13.100
 and 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:23.930
 hello to all youtube friends today 

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:27.199
 I bring another edition of course to websites 

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:30.649
 from lehman and 31 and today we will talk about west 

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:33.530
 germany 27 next to number 11 the worst 

00:00:30.649 --> 00:00:36.290
 of all time and to begin with 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:38.989
 bad the logo in heres for the title of 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:41.150
 the heavy weights between Alberto's 

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:44.750
 river who had won the royal rumble 

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:46.909
 40 men very little fighting time 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:49.280
 It would be a good fight if they had put it 

00:00:46.909 --> 00:00:52.640
 in the middle but being for the title 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:54.949
 disappointed a lot and once again try 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:56.989
 dulling west's penis he had ten 

00:00:54.949 --> 00:00:59.989
 but at the moment they do not get it 

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:03.019
 finally he takes her with a spear 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:06.200
 the following is the fight between cody ross 

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:09.050
 and king mysterio cody needed the fight 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:11.780
 to be someone important but more than 

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:13.970
 a fight needed a rivalry cody 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:16.130
 he could reach high but but we see what 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:16.940
 what does he do now with the character of star 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:19.880
 gas 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:22.970
 it's not bad mystery fight it showed off and 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:24.950
 cody also put his own at the end 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:27.640
 cody gives you mystery with the protector 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:30.560
 of his knee and applies a cross road 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:33.020
 then we had a fight 4 against 4 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.930
 Between big show game 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:37.670
 santino marella and kofi kingston 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:40.160
 facing the core that 'stable' 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:43.160
 formed by the supposed way leader 

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:45.710
 barrett justin gay good bosses leader and 

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:48.020
 ezequiel jackson the truth was 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:50.270
 interesting to see the core but it's a 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:51.530
 stuffed fight and stuffed more stuffed 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:54.110
 what star fights 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:56.660
 I would have faced de coria 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:59.630
 nexus that were the two tables that 

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:02.240
 had but it was not like that they took it 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:05.150
 good guys after a ko pick fans 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:08.050
 show about slider the following is a 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:11.090
 good fight between ccm punk and randy orton 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:13.430
 much luchistic quality one of the 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:16.010
 best fights of the night and next to the 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:18.230
 of triple h against a undertaker was the 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:19.069
 that saved this one because it used to be the 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:21.409
 worst 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:23.749
 He highlighted, above all, how the 

00:02:21.409 --> 00:02:25.760
 rivalry until the event when ortho 

00:02:23.749 --> 00:02:28.459
 is hurting all members of 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:31.579
 the nexus is taken by the viper after 

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:34.129
 apply a ere the corporal then the 

00:02:31.579 --> 00:02:37.069
 fight between quotes the fight between 

00:02:34.129 --> 00:02:39.920
 michael counter and laura the only thing 

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:41.810
 It was worth it was seeing Steve Austin 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:44.359
 the lawler leads but they give him the victory 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:47.359
 to cold by the help of the snakes of 

00:02:44.359 --> 00:02:50.209
 bell did not taste nor fight nor 

00:02:47.359 --> 00:02:52.129
 rivalry and they are 14 minutes that could you 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:55.879
 have given the fight for the title of 

00:02:52.129 --> 00:02:57.590
 the usa between james and brian after 

00:02:55.879 --> 00:03:00.349
 we have the best fight of the night 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:02.930
 triple h was facing undertaker by 

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:05.000
 second time in ures lehman and the fight 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:07.579
 it's a massacre but very good 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:10.250
 quality I have to admit that I feared for 

00:03:07.579 --> 00:03:12.650
 the dead man's streak resists nothing 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:14.959
 more or less than 3 pedigrees a 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:17.689
 tombstone and a tremendous beating of 

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:20.750
 triple h as for example the recital of 

00:03:17.689 --> 00:03:22.969
 sillazos and competed with the resin against 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:25.819
 punk in made in the bank for being the 

00:03:22.969 --> 00:03:28.999
 best of 2011 otherwise the 2000 

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:31.999
 It was bullshit this fight was great 

00:03:28.999 --> 00:03:34.280
 never had taker so touched and it was the 

00:03:31.999 --> 00:03:36.709
 carries the germ when triple h is going to 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:39.139
 hit the hammer and make it his hell's 

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:42.139
 gate to make the brain killer 

00:03:39.139 --> 00:03:43.969
 surrender it is worth noting that at the end of 

00:03:42.139 --> 00:03:47.959
 the undertaker fight came out on stretcher 

00:03:43.969 --> 00:03:50.870
 but the streak increased to 19 to 0 then 

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:53.030
 we have a fight of 3 against 3 between 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:56.689
 john morrison along with trish stratus 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:59.060
 who came back after 5 years and it's never 

00:03:56.689 --> 00:04:01.189
 belonged to a reality show and it 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:03.829
 they faced dolph ziggler michelle 

00:04:01.189 --> 00:04:06.109
 mccool and laila is a bit of a struggle 

00:04:03.829 --> 00:04:08.540
 controversial because the conflict starts 

00:04:06.109 --> 00:04:11.419
 between strata and morrison that caused the 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:13.540
 melina output of the wwf and with the 

00:04:11.419 --> 00:04:16.849
 time also to morrison 

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:18.979
 finally snooki covered macul and by 

00:04:16.849 --> 00:04:21.520
 last in the main event we also have 

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:25.039
 against jones and na for the title of the 

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:27.830
 wwf one of the worst men events of the 

00:04:25.039 --> 00:04:30.500
 storyline the storyline was good but the 

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:31.520
 shit with the return of the rock the 

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:34.190
 fight just 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:36.680
 tie for double disqualification out 

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:39.110
 of the ring on account of 10 but of rock 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:41.419
 orders start fighting again and 

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:43.310

00:04:41.419 --> 00:04:46.310
