hello this is a tutorial on how to make

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:09.110 
hello this is a tutorial on how to make
a<00:00:06.810> kirby<00:00:07.290> out<00:00:07.470> of<00:00:07.620> polymer<00:00:08.040> clay<00:00:08.189> what<00:00:08.970> you're

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.120 
a kirby out of polymer clay what you're

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.830 
a kirby out of polymer clay what you're
gonna<00:00:09.240> need<00:00:09.480> is<00:00:09.540> like<00:00:10.230> a<00:00:10.469> pink<00:00:10.830> color<00:00:11.370> and<00:00:11.840> a

gonna need is like a pink color and a

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.129 
gonna need is like a pink color and a
like<00:00:13.650> reddish<00:00:14.040> color<00:00:14.370> of<00:00:14.910> polymer<00:00:15.780> clay<00:00:15.929> I'm

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
like reddish color of polymer clay I'm

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:18.859 
like reddish color of polymer clay I'm
using<00:00:16.350> sculpey<00:00:17.130> and<00:00:17.670> I<00:00:18.060> actually<00:00:18.240> didn't<00:00:18.690> have

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
using sculpey and I actually didn't have

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:21.769 
using sculpey and I actually didn't have
like<00:00:19.350> a<00:00:19.560> pink<00:00:20.160> color<00:00:20.430> so<00:00:20.580> I<00:00:20.850> just<00:00:21.180> mixed

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
like a pink color so I just mixed

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:26.810 
like a pink color so I just mixed
together<00:00:22.100> red<00:00:23.100> and<00:00:23.490> white<00:00:24.060> and<00:00:24.439> a<00:00:25.439> lot<00:00:25.820> but

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
together red and white and a lot but

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.939 
together red and white and a lot but
then<00:00:27.000> it'll<00:00:27.330> turn<00:00:27.810> pink<00:00:28.140> eventually<00:00:28.769> and<00:00:28.890> it

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
then it'll turn pink eventually and it

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.130 
then it'll turn pink eventually and it
looks<00:00:29.130> kind<00:00:29.369> of<00:00:29.490> just<00:00:29.670> like<00:00:29.789> regular<00:00:30.179> clay<00:00:30.390> so

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
looks kind of just like regular clay so

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.170 
looks kind of just like regular clay so
I've<00:00:31.470> already<00:00:31.859> made<00:00:32.099> out<00:00:32.250> the<00:00:32.460> parts<00:00:32.940> these

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
I've already made out the parts these

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.209 
I've already made out the parts these
need<00:00:33.420> one<00:00:33.690> big<00:00:34.140> pink<00:00:34.770> circle<00:00:35.309> for<00:00:35.730> the<00:00:35.940> body

00:00:37.209 --> 00:00:37.219 
need one big pink circle for the body

00:00:37.219 --> 00:00:40.670 
need one big pink circle for the body
two<00:00:38.219> little<00:00:38.940> pieces<00:00:39.149> of<00:00:39.329> pink<00:00:39.690> for<00:00:39.780> his<00:00:40.110> arms

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
two little pieces of pink for his arms

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.389 
two little pieces of pink for his arms
and<00:00:41.239> then<00:00:42.239> just<00:00:42.270> two<00:00:42.750> pieces<00:00:42.930> of<00:00:43.110> red<00:00:43.350> for<00:00:44.250> the

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
and then just two pieces of red for the

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:48.049 
and then just two pieces of red for the
feet<00:00:44.610> so<00:00:46.010> these<00:00:47.010> parts<00:00:47.370> are<00:00:47.489> already<00:00:47.760> like

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
feet so these parts are already like

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.569 
feet so these parts are already like
made<00:00:48.329> they're<00:00:48.629> all<00:00:48.780> circles<00:00:49.260> but<00:00:50.129> I'll<00:00:50.399> make

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
made they're all circles but I'll make

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.360 
made they're all circles but I'll make
the<00:00:50.789> feet<00:00:51.149> there<00:00:51.510> I'm<00:00:52.079> pretty<00:00:52.980> sure<00:00:53.160> they're

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
the feet there I'm pretty sure they're

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.729 
the feet there I'm pretty sure they're
like<00:00:53.579> kind<00:00:53.910> of<00:00:54.030> oval<00:00:54.750> II<00:00:54.899> and<00:00:55.199> then<00:00:55.350> at<00:00:55.530> the<00:00:55.680> end

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
like kind of oval II and then at the end

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.849 
like kind of oval II and then at the end
Pope's<00:00:56.640> eye<00:00:56.850> at<00:00:57.809> the<00:00:58.020> end<00:00:58.170> you<00:00:58.410> just<00:00:58.440> kind<00:00:58.829> of

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
Pope's eye at the end you just kind of

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.069 
Pope's eye at the end you just kind of
like<00:00:59.039> pinch<00:00:59.789> it<00:00:59.910> a<00:01:00.030> little<00:01:00.210> bit<00:01:00.420> and<00:01:00.629> it's<00:01:00.870> like

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
like pinch it a little bit and it's like

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.820 
like pinch it a little bit and it's like
a<00:01:01.489> little<00:01:02.489> pointed<00:01:03.379> try<00:01:04.379> to<00:01:04.439> make<00:01:04.559> the<00:01:04.680> bottom

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
a little pointed try to make the bottom

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:12.440 
a little pointed try to make the bottom
flat<00:01:07.430> kinda<00:01:08.430> like<00:01:08.520> that<00:01:10.790> and<00:01:11.790> then<00:01:12.000> just<00:01:12.240> try

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
flat kinda like that and then just try

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:13.850 
flat kinda like that and then just try
to<00:01:12.510> make<00:01:12.689> two<00:01:12.869> of<00:01:12.960> them<00:01:13.080> that<00:01:13.260> look<00:01:13.439> pretty

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
to make two of them that look pretty

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.240 
to make two of them that look pretty
similar<00:01:14.570> and<00:01:15.570> his<00:01:15.720> feet<00:01:15.960> are<00:01:15.990> actually<00:01:16.320> kind

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
similar and his feet are actually kind

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:22.520 
similar and his feet are actually kind
of<00:01:17.369> big<00:01:18.770> so<00:01:20.270> even<00:01:21.270> if<00:01:21.360> they<00:01:21.509> look<00:01:21.689> kind<00:01:21.990> of<00:01:22.140> like

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
of big so even if they look kind of like

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:23.899 
of big so even if they look kind of like
too<00:01:22.799> big<00:01:23.070> I<00:01:23.189> don't<00:01:23.340> know<00:01:23.400> I<00:01:23.430> guess<00:01:23.640> you<00:01:23.759> can

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
too big I don't know I guess you can

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.030 
too big I don't know I guess you can
change<00:01:24.150> it<00:01:24.270> if<00:01:24.330> you<00:01:24.360> want<00:01:24.479> to<00:01:24.780> but<00:01:24.960> I<00:01:25.259> think

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
change it if you want to but I think

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.260 
change it if you want to but I think
Kirby<00:01:26.580> has<00:01:26.759> big<00:01:27.060> feet

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:29.270 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:31.789 

so<00:01:30.270> they<00:01:30.659> don't<00:01:30.840> have<00:01:30.960> to<00:01:31.049> be<00:01:31.140> exactly<00:01:31.619> the

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
so they don't have to be exactly the

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:37.069 
so they don't have to be exactly the
same<00:01:31.829> but<00:01:32.340> I<00:01:35.600> don't<00:01:36.600> know<00:01:36.659> they're<00:01:36.840> pretty

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
same but I don't know they're pretty

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:42.980 
same but I don't know they're pretty
similar<00:01:37.650> looking<00:01:40.729> and<00:01:41.729> then<00:01:42.240> after<00:01:42.600> you<00:01:42.750> kind

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
similar looking and then after you kind

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.330 
similar looking and then after you kind
of<00:01:43.079> you<00:01:43.200> know<00:01:43.290> like<00:01:43.409> round<00:01:43.649> out<00:01:43.799> the<00:01:43.950> edges<00:01:44.220> and

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
of you know like round out the edges and

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:45.880 
of you know like round out the edges and
get<00:01:44.430> out<00:01:44.579> how<00:01:44.700> you<00:01:44.759> like<00:01:44.880> it

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:45.890 
get out how you like it

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:53.990 
get out how you like it
then<00:01:49.579> set<00:01:50.579> them<00:01:50.909> down<00:01:51.180> and<00:01:52.430> take<00:01:53.430> your<00:01:53.490> pink

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
then set them down and take your pink

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:02.240 
then set them down and take your pink
ball<00:01:56.180> and<00:01:57.320> just<00:01:58.320> push<00:01:59.130> it<00:01:59.159> on<00:01:59.399> it

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.740 

you<00:02:03.250> can<00:02:03.370> want<00:02:03.580> to<00:02:03.670> make<00:02:03.820> it<00:02:04.000> so<00:02:04.150> that<00:02:04.300> it<00:02:04.450> kind

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:04.750 
you can want to make it so that it kind

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:08.190 
you can want to make it so that it kind
of<00:02:04.840> like<00:02:05.880> it's<00:02:06.880> in<00:02:07.120> the<00:02:07.240> clay<00:02:07.450> good<00:02:07.720> so<00:02:07.960> what

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:08.200 
of like it's in the clay good so what

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:10.169 
of like it's in the clay good so what
that<00:02:08.649> when<00:02:08.800> you<00:02:08.920> bake<00:02:09.130> it<00:02:09.160> it<00:02:09.399> doesn't<00:02:09.580> fall

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:10.179 
that when you bake it it doesn't fall

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:17.720 
that when you bake it it doesn't fall
out

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:21.740 

all<00:02:18.390> right<00:02:18.510> so<00:02:19.819> then<00:02:20.819> try<00:02:21.060> to<00:02:21.120> keep<00:02:21.360> as<00:02:21.540> much<00:02:21.690> of

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
all right so then try to keep as much of

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:26.390 
all right so then try to keep as much of
the<00:02:22.080> circle<00:02:22.530> as<00:02:22.709> possible<00:02:24.080> and<00:02:25.190> then<00:02:26.190> just

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
the circle as possible and then just

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.039 
the circle as possible and then just
take<00:02:26.610> the<00:02:26.730> two<00:02:26.909> little<00:02:27.180> arms<00:02:27.510> and<00:02:27.659> put<00:02:27.900> them

00:02:28.039 --> 00:02:28.049 
take the two little arms and put them

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:29.449 
take the two little arms and put them
off<00:02:28.230> you<00:02:28.409> want<00:02:28.620> it<00:02:28.739> I<00:02:28.830> think<00:02:29.040> I'm<00:02:29.099> gonna<00:02:29.220> have
