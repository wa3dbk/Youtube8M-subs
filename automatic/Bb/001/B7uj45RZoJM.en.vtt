well<00:00:00.149> the<00:00:00.420> furnace<00:00:00.780> is<00:00:00.930> heating<00:00:01.439> up<00:00:01.530> right<00:00:01.829> now

00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:02.040 
well the furnace is heating up right now

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:03.740 
well the furnace is heating up right now
we're<00:00:02.280> going<00:00:02.429> to<00:00:02.550> start<00:00:02.760> melting<00:00:03.240> some<00:00:03.449> metal

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:03.750 
we're going to start melting some metal

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:05.030 
we're going to start melting some metal
but<00:00:03.899> in<00:00:03.990> the<00:00:04.080> meantime<00:00:04.259> while<00:00:04.770> I'm<00:00:04.920> waiting

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:05.040 
but in the meantime while I'm waiting

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:07.280 
but in the meantime while I'm waiting
for<00:00:05.220> that<00:00:05.400> to<00:00:05.640> warm<00:00:05.879> up<00:00:06.089> I'd<00:00:06.690> like<00:00:06.750> to<00:00:07.080> show<00:00:07.259> you

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:07.290 
for that to warm up I'd like to show you

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:09.919 
for that to warm up I'd like to show you
guys<00:00:07.589> a<00:00:08.040> little<00:00:08.550> bit<00:00:08.849> about<00:00:09.179> flasks<00:00:09.809> and

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:09.929 
guys a little bit about flasks and

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:10.759 
guys a little bit about flasks and

a<00:00:11.420> flask<00:00:12.420> is<00:00:12.840> a<00:00:13.469> container<00:00:13.950> I<00:00:14.780> don't<00:00:15.780> know

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
a flask is a container I don't know

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:18.019 
a flask is a container I don't know
really<00:00:16.529> a<00:00:16.680> better<00:00:16.890> way<00:00:17.070> to<00:00:17.130> describe<00:00:17.609> it<00:00:17.789> maybe

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
really a better way to describe it maybe

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.189 
really a better way to describe it maybe
a<00:00:18.119> box<00:00:18.590> that<00:00:19.670> holds<00:00:20.670> the<00:00:20.880> sand<00:00:21.180> it<00:00:21.570> holds<00:00:21.990> the

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
a box that holds the sand it holds the

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:27.410 
a box that holds the sand it holds the
mold<00:00:23.300> inside<00:00:24.300> of<00:00:24.480> it<00:00:24.630> a<00:00:25.619> flask<00:00:26.240> consists<00:00:27.240> of

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
mold inside of it a flask consists of

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.320 
mold inside of it a flask consists of
two<00:00:27.779> parts<00:00:28.050> there's<00:00:28.500> a<00:00:28.800> cope<00:00:29.189> and<00:00:29.460> a<00:00:29.519> drag<00:00:29.880> or<00:00:30.269> a

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
two parts there's a cope and a drag or a

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:37.970 
two parts there's a cope and a drag or a
top<00:00:30.660> and<00:00:30.869> a<00:00:30.929> bottom<00:00:31.550> and<00:00:33.380> they<00:00:34.380> fit<00:00:34.680> together

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.260 

pretty<00:00:38.610> much<00:00:38.880> just<00:00:39.780> like<00:00:40.110> this<00:00:40.670> and<00:00:41.670> I<00:00:42.090> have

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
pretty much just like this and I have

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.340 
pretty much just like this and I have
the<00:00:42.630> alignment<00:00:43.140> pins<00:00:43.650> on<00:00:43.950> there<00:00:44.220> you<00:00:44.370> can<00:00:44.550> see

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:45.350 
the alignment pins on there you can see

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:48.770 
the alignment pins on there you can see
and<00:00:46.350> what<00:00:46.680> that<00:00:46.829> does<00:00:47.129> is<00:00:47.940> it<00:00:48.090> helps<00:00:48.120> to<00:00:48.420> align

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
and what that does is it helps to align

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.869 
and what that does is it helps to align
the<00:00:48.989> flask<00:00:49.260> and<00:00:49.559> make<00:00:49.710> sure<00:00:49.890> that<00:00:50.040> the<00:00:50.309> the<00:00:50.670> two

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
the flask and make sure that the the two

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.320 
the flask and make sure that the the two
halves<00:00:51.150> go<00:00:51.480> back<00:00:51.720> together<00:00:51.960> only<00:00:52.559> one<00:00:52.829> way<00:00:53.330> so

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:54.330 
halves go back together only one way so

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:57.829 
halves go back together only one way so
this<00:00:54.750> is<00:00:54.809> the<00:00:55.140> flask<00:00:55.470> and<00:00:55.980> that's<00:00:56.839> assembled

00:00:57.829 --> 00:00:57.839 
this is the flask and that's assembled

00:00:57.839 --> 00:01:00.049 
this is the flask and that's assembled
like<00:00:58.050> that<00:00:58.320> over<00:00:59.160> here<00:00:59.309> you<00:00:59.460> can<00:00:59.640> see<00:00:59.850> the

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
like that over here you can see the

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:00.860 
like that over here you can see the
green<00:01:00.300> sand

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
green sand

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.790 
green sand
now<00:01:01.530> it's<00:01:02.190> called<00:01:03.059> green<00:01:03.449> sand<00:01:03.809> not<00:01:04.259> because

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:04.800 
now it's called green sand not because

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.800 
now it's called green sand not because
of<00:01:04.949> its<00:01:05.100> color<00:01:05.309> obviously<00:01:06.180> but<00:01:06.360> because<00:01:06.690> of

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
of its color obviously but because of

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.890 
of its color obviously but because of
the<00:01:06.869> fact<00:01:07.110> that<00:01:07.229> it's<00:01:07.440> reusable<00:01:08.330> the<00:01:09.330> sand

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
the fact that it's reusable the sand

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.430 
the fact that it's reusable the sand
that<00:01:10.050> foundries<00:01:10.740> use<00:01:11.039> is<00:01:11.720> recycled<00:01:12.720> and

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:14.440 
that foundries use is recycled and

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:18.780 
that foundries use is recycled and
used<00:01:15.130> over<00:01:15.700> and<00:01:15.790> over<00:01:15.880> again<00:01:16.150> until<00:01:17.790> there's

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:18.790 
used over and over again until there's

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:21.470 
used over and over again until there's
no<00:01:19.330> more<00:01:19.360> life<00:01:19.840> left<00:01:20.170> in<00:01:20.380> it<00:01:20.590> and<00:01:20.860> they<00:01:20.950> have

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:21.480 
no more life left in it and they have

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:26.540 
no more life left in it and they have
machinery<00:01:22.480> that<00:01:22.960> sorts<00:01:23.860> out<00:01:24.040> the<00:01:25.110> the<00:01:26.110> burnt

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:26.550 
machinery that sorts out the the burnt

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:30.090 
machinery that sorts out the the burnt
old<00:01:27.550> used<00:01:28.330> sand<00:01:28.870> that<00:01:29.140> can't<00:01:29.470> be<00:01:29.650> used<00:01:29.890> anymore

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:30.100 
old used sand that can't be used anymore

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:33.630 
old used sand that can't be used anymore
and<00:01:30.760> that<00:01:30.970> gets<00:01:31.810> thrown<00:01:32.500> away<00:01:32.740> or<00:01:33.130> sent<00:01:33.460> off<00:01:33.610> to

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:33.640 
and that gets thrown away or sent off to

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:36.000 
and that gets thrown away or sent off to
a<00:01:33.850> landfill<00:01:34.360> and<00:01:34.810> then<00:01:35.200> the<00:01:35.320> other<00:01:35.470> sand<00:01:35.830> is

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:36.010 
a landfill and then the other sand is

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:37.620 
a landfill and then the other sand is
run<00:01:36.220> through<00:01:36.460> what's<00:01:36.670> called<00:01:36.880> a<00:01:37.000> sand<00:01:37.300> mauler

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:37.630 
run through what's called a sand mauler

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:41.430 
run through what's called a sand mauler
which<00:01:37.990> basically<00:01:39.060> grinds<00:01:40.060> it<00:01:40.420> down<00:01:40.810> to<00:01:41.140> a<00:01:41.170> very

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:41.440 
which basically grinds it down to a very

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:45.300 
which basically grinds it down to a very
very<00:01:41.620> fine<00:01:42.220> texture<00:01:43.170> now<00:01:44.170> this<00:01:44.440> sand<00:01:44.800> has<00:01:45.100> not

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:45.310 
very fine texture now this sand has not

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:51.900 
very fine texture now this sand has not
been<00:01:45.610> mauled<00:01:46.650> but<00:01:47.650> I<00:01:47.980> do<00:01:48.580> have<00:01:48.940> a<00:01:48.970> video<00:01:49.410> in<00:01:50.910> on

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:51.910 
been mauled but I do have a video in on

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:55.200 
been mauled but I do have a video in on
my<00:01:52.240> channel<00:01:52.750> you<00:01:53.010> can<00:01:54.010> see<00:01:54.340> what<00:01:54.760> this<00:01:54.940> green

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:55.210 
my channel you can see what this green

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:57.330 
my channel you can see what this green
sand<00:01:55.570> looks<00:01:55.840> like<00:01:56.050> after<00:01:56.470> it's<00:01:56.620> been<00:01:56.770> sifted

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:57.340 
sand looks like after it's been sifted

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:03.480 
sand looks like after it's been sifted
all<00:01:57.780> but<00:01:58.780> basically<00:01:59.470> this<00:01:59.830> sand<00:02:00.580> is<00:02:02.490> a

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:03.490 
all but basically this sand is a

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:08.280 
all but basically this sand is a
combination<00:02:04.420> of<00:02:04.860> sand<00:02:05.860> and<00:02:06.430> clay<00:02:07.020> with<00:02:08.020> some

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:08.290 
combination of sand and clay with some

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:09.750 
combination of sand and clay with some
other<00:02:08.440> ingredients<00:02:09.070> added<00:02:09.399> to<00:02:09.610> improve

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:09.760 
other ingredients added to improve

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:13.540 
other ingredients added to improve
porosities<00:02:10.590> or<00:02:11.590> permeability

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:13.550 
porosities or permeability

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:16.750 
porosities or permeability
to<00:02:13.760> allow<00:02:14.240> the<00:02:14.300> venting<00:02:14.810> of<00:02:14.900> gases<00:02:15.580> blah<00:02:16.580> blah

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760 
to allow the venting of gases blah blah

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:19.360 
to allow the venting of gases blah blah
blah<00:02:17.000> we're<00:02:17.960> making<00:02:18.260> a<00:02:18.350> simple<00:02:18.560> video<00:02:18.800> here<00:02:19.190> so

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370 
blah we're making a simple video here so

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:21.660 
blah we're making a simple video here so
we<00:02:19.490> don't<00:02:19.670> need<00:02:19.850> to<00:02:19.970> know<00:02:20.090> all<00:02:20.360> of<00:02:20.390> that<00:02:20.570> but

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:21.670 
we don't need to know all of that but

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:27.670 
we don't need to know all of that but
this<00:02:22.670> sand<00:02:23.120> is<00:02:23.450> a<00:02:24.440> very<00:02:25.190> fine<00:02:25.520> texture<00:02:26.030> it<00:02:26.720> when

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:27.680 
this sand is a very fine texture it when

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:31.690 
this sand is a very fine texture it when
it's<00:02:28.000> moistened<00:02:29.000> it<00:02:29.240> sticks<00:02:30.080> to<00:02:30.290> itself<00:02:30.710> and

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
it's moistened it sticks to itself and

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:35.500 
it's moistened it sticks to itself and
it<00:02:32.540> makes<00:02:32.900> really<00:02:33.200> nice<00:02:33.520> material<00:02:34.520> for<00:02:34.880> making

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:35.510 
it makes really nice material for making

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:38.200 
it makes really nice material for making
molds<00:02:35.750> out<00:02:35.990> of<00:02:36.200> because<00:02:36.410> you<00:02:37.250> place<00:02:37.520> a<00:02:37.550> pattern

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:38.210 
molds out of because you place a pattern

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:41.140 
molds out of because you place a pattern
into<00:02:38.840> the<00:02:38.870> bowl<00:02:39.110> you<00:02:39.470> ran<00:02:40.460> the<00:02:40.670> sand<00:02:40.910> and

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:41.150 
into the bowl you ran the sand and

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:43.510 
into the bowl you ran the sand and
around<00:02:41.420> it<00:02:41.630> you<00:02:42.110> remove<00:02:42.410> the<00:02:42.590> pattern<00:02:42.830> and

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:43.520 
around it you remove the pattern and

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:45.520 
around it you remove the pattern and
then<00:02:43.760> the<00:02:43.820> sand<00:02:44.180> holds<00:02:44.660> the<00:02:44.780> shape<00:02:45.020> of<00:02:45.080> what

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:45.530 
then the sand holds the shape of what

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:50.210 
then the sand holds the shape of what
the<00:02:45.680> pattern<00:02:45.860> was<00:02:46.330> so

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:54.500 

I<00:02:50.310> I<00:02:51.210> don't<00:02:51.660> know<00:02:51.900> any<00:02:52.590> better<00:02:52.980> way<00:02:53.310> to<00:02:53.510> explain

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
I I don't know any better way to explain

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:55.070 
I I don't know any better way to explain
it

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:55.080 
it

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:59.180 
it
at<00:02:55.920> least<00:02:56.220> not<00:02:56.520> offhand<00:02:57.330> but<00:02:57.630> if<00:02:58.320> you<00:02:58.560> look<00:02:59.010> at

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
at least not offhand but if you look at

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:03.390 
at least not offhand but if you look at
some<00:02:59.430> of<00:02:59.550> my<00:02:59.580> other<00:02:59.760> videos<00:03:00.000> I

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:03.400 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:07.200 

I<00:03:03.459> have<00:03:04.209> examples

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:07.210 

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:09.290 

holding

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:09.300 
holding

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:12.800 
holding
making<00:03:10.080> moles<00:03:10.320> and<00:03:11.310> pouring<00:03:12.060> metal<00:03:12.240> into<00:03:12.630> them

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810 
making moles and pouring metal into them

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:15.380 
making moles and pouring metal into them
so<00:03:13.170> feel<00:03:13.590> free<00:03:13.650> to<00:03:13.890> check<00:03:14.040> those<00:03:14.430> out<00:03:14.670> we're

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:15.390 
so feel free to check those out we're

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:16.880 
so feel free to check those out we're
going<00:03:15.570> to<00:03:15.690> let<00:03:15.840> this<00:03:16.080> furnace<00:03:16.440> heat<00:03:16.650> up<00:03:16.770> a

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:16.890 
going to let this furnace heat up a

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:18.140 
going to let this furnace heat up a
little<00:03:17.130> bit<00:03:17.280> then<00:03:17.490> we're<00:03:17.610> going<00:03:17.820> to<00:03:17.880> start

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
little bit then we're going to start

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:21.470 
little bit then we're going to start
melting<00:03:18.330> down<00:03:18.570> some<00:03:18.930> soda<00:03:19.170> cans
