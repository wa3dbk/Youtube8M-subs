the<00:03:32.209> margins<00:03:32.890> for<00:03:33.890> errors<00:03:34.190> so<00:03:34.580> you<00:03:34.640> know<00:03:34.940> a

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:34.970 
the margins for errors so you know a

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:37.780

00:03:56.559 --> 00:03:56.569 
halftime they were going to wind it up

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:57.910 
halftime they were going to wind it up
back<00:03:56.780> so<00:03:57.019> we<00:03:57.140> were<00:03:57.200> going<00:03:57.319> to<00:03:57.380> pressure<00:03:57.590> a<00:03:57.680> lot

00:03:57.910 --> 00:03:57.920 
back so we were going to pressure a lot

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:59.410 
back so we were going to pressure a lot
so<00:03:58.370> I<00:03:58.400> was<00:03:58.610> pressuring<00:03:58.910> the<00:03:59.030> center<00:03:59.239> back<00:03:59.360> and

00:03:59.410 --> 00:03:59.420 
so I was pressuring the center back and

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:00.880 
so I was pressuring the center back and
he<00:03:59.690> passed<00:03:59.900> it<00:04:00.050> back<00:04:00.170> to<00:04:00.290> the<00:04:00.380> goalie<00:04:00.620> and<00:04:00.739> it

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:00.890 
he passed it back to the goalie and it

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:02.650 
he passed it back to the goalie and it
was<00:04:00.980> a<00:04:01.010> bit<00:04:01.310> of<00:04:01.430> a<00:04:01.489> short<00:04:01.700> pass<00:04:01.850> and<00:04:02.300> so<00:04:02.450> I<00:04:02.480> just

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:02.660 
was a bit of a short pass and so I just

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:05.470 
was a bit of a short pass and so I just
ran<00:04:02.810> on<00:04:02.989> to<00:04:03.170> it<00:04:03.290> go<00:04:03.440> he<00:04:03.530> decided<00:04:03.830> to<00:04:03.950> stay<00:04:04.220> I<00:04:04.480> got

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:05.480

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:10.940 
thought to cross it Nikko was making a

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:12.789

really<00:04:11.120> good<00:04:11.269> run<00:04:11.480> and<00:04:11.780> and<00:04:12.500> then<00:04:12.620> at<00:04:12.709> the<00:04:12.769> last

00:04:12.789 --> 00:04:12.799 
really good run and and then at the last

00:04:12.799 --> 00:04:14.259 
really good run and and then at the last
second<00:04:13.250> I<00:04:13.280> kind<00:04:13.489> of<00:04:13.519> thought<00:04:13.670> you<00:04:13.940> know<00:04:13.970> let's

00:04:25.029 --> 00:04:25.039 
we've been working on this was under

00:04:25.039 --> 00:04:26.830

difficult<00:04:25.460> circumstances<00:04:25.490> with<00:04:26.330> driving

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:26.840 
difficult circumstances with driving

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:29.350

00:04:31.719 --> 00:04:31.729 
yesterday and I think a better team that
