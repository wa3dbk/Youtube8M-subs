00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
was showing you my plans for making a

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:17.240 
was showing you my plans for making a
ugly<00:00:13.469> drum<00:00:13.830> smoker<00:00:14.219> and<00:00:14.809> I<00:00:15.809> had<00:00:16.590> some<00:00:16.800> specific

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
ugly drum smoker and I had some specific

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.000 
ugly drum smoker and I had some specific
ideas<00:00:17.609> about<00:00:17.789> how<00:00:17.940> I<00:00:17.970> was<00:00:18.090> gonna<00:00:18.180> use<00:00:18.420> this

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:19.010 
ideas about how I was gonna use this

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:23.060 
ideas about how I was gonna use this
weber<00:00:20.010> grill<00:00:20.670> and<00:00:21.650> actually<00:00:22.650> it's<00:00:22.740> worked<00:00:22.920> out

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
weber grill and actually it's worked out

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.040 
weber grill and actually it's worked out
probably<00:00:24.000> better<00:00:24.269> than<00:00:24.449> I<00:00:24.510> thought<00:00:24.779> it<00:00:24.930> would

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
probably better than I thought it would

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:26.980 
probably better than I thought it would
and<00:00:25.199> it's<00:00:25.350> really<00:00:25.710> really<00:00:26.279> simple<00:00:26.670> so<00:00:26.820> I<00:00:26.849> think

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:26.990 
and it's really really simple so I think

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:29.300 
and it's really really simple so I think
there<00:00:27.990> may<00:00:28.140> be<00:00:28.170> other<00:00:28.439> people<00:00:28.529> that<00:00:28.830> have<00:00:29.130> come

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
there may be other people that have come

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:30.620 
there may be other people that have come
up<00:00:29.340> with<00:00:29.550> this<00:00:29.699> I<00:00:29.880> haven't<00:00:30.119> found<00:00:30.330> that<00:00:30.449> when

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
up with this I haven't found that when

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:31.970 
up with this I haven't found that when
I've<00:00:30.720> looked<00:00:30.869> at<00:00:31.019> some<00:00:31.199> of<00:00:31.289> the<00:00:31.349> videos<00:00:31.710> online

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980

but I think I found a way to make one of

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.700 
but I think I found a way to make one of

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:06.640 
special changes or anything like that
I<00:03:04.760> realized<00:03:05.599> that<00:03:05.750> there's<00:03:05.989> a<00:03:06.079> possibility

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:06.650 
I realized that there's a possibility

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:09.580 
I realized that there's a possibility
that<00:03:06.919> it<00:03:07.159> could<00:03:07.280> fall<00:03:07.489> down<00:03:07.760> so<00:03:08.689> I<00:03:09.019> just<00:03:09.379> took

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:09.590 
that it could fall down so I just took

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:12.699 
that it could fall down so I just took
and<00:03:09.919> put<00:03:10.879> four<00:03:11.269> little<00:03:11.569> self-tapping<00:03:12.169> screws

00:03:12.699 --> 00:03:12.709 
and put four little self-tapping screws

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:15.879 
and put four little self-tapping screws
in<00:03:13.519> here<00:03:13.819> and<00:03:14.030> that<00:03:14.329> provides<00:03:15.049> just<00:03:15.319> enough<00:03:15.409> of

00:03:15.879 --> 00:03:15.889 
in here and that provides just enough of

00:03:15.889 --> 00:03:18.250 
in here and that provides just enough of
a<00:03:16.189> lip<00:03:16.430> that<00:03:17.000> this<00:03:17.150> thing<00:03:17.359> cannot<00:03:17.720> fall<00:03:18.049> down

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:18.260 
a lip that this thing cannot fall down

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:19.629 
a lip that this thing cannot fall down
in<00:03:18.470> there<00:03:18.680> you<00:03:18.739> can<00:03:18.889> see<00:03:19.069> that<00:03:19.220> I'm<00:03:19.340> flipping

00:03:59.830 --> 00:03:59.840 
think if you wanted to you could take

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:01.509 
think if you wanted to you could take
this<00:03:59.989> inside<00:04:00.379> clean<00:04:00.709> it<00:04:00.799> off<00:04:00.919> a<00:04:00.949> little<00:04:01.129> bit<00:04:01.370> if

00:04:01.509 --> 00:04:01.519 
this inside clean it off a little bit if

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:03.009 
this inside clean it off a little bit if
you<00:04:01.639> wanted<00:04:01.819> to<00:04:01.970> put<00:04:02.209> some<00:04:02.359> food<00:04:02.540> in<00:04:02.720> there<00:04:02.900> or

you wanted to put some food in there or

00:04:03.019 --> 00:04:04.899 
you wanted to put some food in there or
something<00:04:03.349> like<00:04:03.439> that<00:04:03.500> you<00:04:04.189> could<00:04:04.310> do<00:04:04.489> that<00:04:04.639> to

00:04:04.899 --> 00:04:04.909 
something like that you could do that to

00:04:04.909 --> 00:04:06.309 
something like that you could do that to
it<00:04:05.090> you'd<00:04:05.269> want<00:04:05.449> to<00:04:05.479> make<00:04:05.569> sure<00:04:05.659> that's<00:04:06.019> clean

00:04:06.309 --> 00:04:06.319 
it you'd want to make sure that's clean

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:08.469 
it you'd want to make sure that's clean
and<00:04:06.349> you<00:04:07.010> know<00:04:07.129> heat<00:04:07.790> it<00:04:07.909> up<00:04:08.000> and<00:04:08.120> everything

00:04:08.469 --> 00:04:08.479 
and you know heat it up and everything

got<00:04:38.380> these<00:04:38.590> other<00:04:38.890> guys<00:04:39.070> they're<00:04:39.310> having<00:04:39.580> to

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:39.640 
got these other guys they're having to

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:41.190 
got these other guys they're having to
do<00:04:39.760> things<00:04:40.030> like<00:04:40.150> drill<00:04:40.480> holes<00:04:40.720> in<00:04:40.900> the<00:04:40.990> top

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:43.350 
do things like drill holes in the top
and<00:04:41.230> put<00:04:41.620> it<00:04:41.710> there<00:04:41.800> lids<00:04:42.010> since<00:04:42.790> you<00:04:42.910> use<00:04:43.120> this

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:43.360 
and put it there lids since you use this

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:44.940

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:44.950 
then you've got to set extra clipping

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:47.370 
then you've got to set extra clipping
space<00:04:45.190> so<00:04:45.400> I<00:04:45.430> can<00:04:45.640> get<00:04:45.820> two<00:04:46.030> levels<00:04:46.420> to<00:04:46.660> which<00:04:47.200> I

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:47.380 
space so I can get two levels to which I

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:48.990 
space so I can get two levels to which I
like<00:04:47.560> and<00:04:47.770> this<00:04:47.860> is<00:04:47.980> already<00:04:48.160> mated<00:04:48.400> obviously

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:49.000 
like and this is already mated obviously

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.410 
like and this is already mated obviously
this<00:04:49.630> is<00:04:49.810> all<00:04:50.350> set<00:04:50.680> up<00:04:50.830> these<00:04:51.460> are<00:04:51.880> the<00:04:51.970> handles

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:52.420

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:04.960 
holes like this I may end up being

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:06.210 
holes like this I may end up being
making<00:05:05.260> them<00:05:05.440> a<00:05:05.470> little<00:05:05.650> bit<00:05:05.770> bigger<00:05:05.890> we'll

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:08.170 
see or I make more holes I don't know

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:12.690 
see or I make more holes I don't know
that<00:05:08.530> I<00:05:08.560> got<00:05:08.770> here's<00:05:09.010> my<00:05:10.140> handy<00:05:11.140> little<00:05:11.700> vent
