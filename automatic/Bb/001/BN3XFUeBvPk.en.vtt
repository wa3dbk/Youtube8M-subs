00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
pickup cover because I just like the

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.600 
pickup cover because I just like the
black<00:00:53.309> and<00:00:53.579> I<00:00:54.539> had<00:00:54.750> one<00:00:54.960> laying<00:00:55.170> around<00:00:55.320> and<00:00:55.739> I

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
black and I had one laying around and I

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.459 
black and I had one laying around and I
had<00:00:57.270> to<00:00:57.390> change<00:00:57.660> the<00:00:57.899> height<00:00:58.050> adjustment

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
had to change the height adjustment

00:00:58.469 --> 00:00:59.750 
had to change the height adjustment
screws<00:00:58.680> because<00:00:58.829> when<00:00:59.070> I<00:00:59.129> took<00:00:59.219> the<00:00:59.460> counter

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
screws because when I took the counter

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.430 
screws because when I took the counter
off<00:00:59.910> the<00:01:00.480> screws<00:01:00.780> went<00:01:00.989> with<00:01:01.140> it<00:01:01.320> just

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
off the screws went with it just

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.460 
off the screws went with it just
immediately<00:01:01.800> stripped<00:01:02.309> them<00:01:02.489> out<00:01:02.670> so<00:01:03.470> change

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
immediately stripped them out so change

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:05.929 
immediately stripped them out so change
that<00:01:04.680> but<00:01:04.860> apart<00:01:05.040> from<00:01:05.100> that<00:01:05.250> I<00:01:05.400> think<00:01:05.549> I

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
that but apart from that I think I

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:09.469 
that but apart from that I think I
rolled<00:01:06.630> the<00:01:06.840> fingerboard<00:01:08.060> so<00:01:09.060> it's<00:01:09.210> a<00:01:09.299> little

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
rolled the fingerboard so it's a little

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.390 
rolled the fingerboard so it's a little
bit<00:01:09.600> easier<00:01:09.630> to<00:01:09.900> play<00:01:10.170> a<00:01:10.200> little<00:01:10.470> bit<00:01:10.710> smoother

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
bit easier to play a little bit smoother

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.300 
bit easier to play a little bit smoother
it's<00:01:11.520> not<00:01:11.640> sharp<00:01:12.000> on<00:01:12.270> the<00:01:12.630> edges<00:01:13.409> in<00:01:14.010> between

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
it's not sharp on the edges in between

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.580 
it's not sharp on the edges in between
the<00:01:14.400> frets<00:01:14.610> but<00:01:15.299> yeah<00:01:15.450> still<00:01:16.200> like<00:01:16.380> this

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
the frets but yeah still like this

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.320 
the frets but yeah still like this

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
attenuated with an air brake so it's not

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.260 
attenuated with an air brake so it's not
too<00:01:34.020> long<00:01:34.140> but<00:01:34.439> still<00:01:34.770> pretty<00:01:35.340> very<00:01:35.610> loud<00:01:35.909> so

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.820 

so<00:02:06.250> yeah<00:02:06.820> this<00:02:07.030> thing<00:02:07.330> has<00:02:08.289> a<00:02:08.320> pretty<00:02:08.619> hot

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:08.830 
so yeah this thing has a pretty hot

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:10.440 
so yeah this thing has a pretty hot
pickup<00:02:09.220> I<00:02:09.340> think<00:02:09.580> like<00:02:09.880> I<00:02:09.910> said<00:02:10.209> in<00:02:10.330> the<00:02:10.420> last

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:10.450 
pickup I think like I said in the last

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:13.020 
pickup I think like I said in the last
video<00:02:10.959> when<00:02:11.170> I<00:02:11.260> first<00:02:11.500> got<00:02:11.680> this<00:02:11.860> thing<00:02:12.100> it's

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
video when I first got this thing it's

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:16.410 
video when I first got this thing it's
about<00:02:13.180> 9<00:02:13.570> K<00:02:14.230> so<00:02:14.739> it's<00:02:14.980> some<00:02:15.220> pretty<00:02:15.880> hot<00:02:16.150> pretty

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 
about 9 K so it's some pretty hot pretty

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:19.590 
about 9 K so it's some pretty hot pretty
beefy<00:02:16.750> um<00:02:17.190> the<00:02:18.190> guitar<00:02:18.489> itself<00:02:18.970> is<00:02:19.239> really

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:19.600 
beefy um the guitar itself is really

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:21.270 
beefy um the guitar itself is really
aggressive<00:02:19.959> and<00:02:20.440> kind<00:02:20.650> of<00:02:20.800> immediate

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280 
aggressive and kind of immediate

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:24.210 
aggressive and kind of immediate
sounding<00:02:21.730> um<00:02:22.420> the<00:02:22.989> jr.<00:02:23.440> is<00:02:23.770> a<00:02:23.800> little<00:02:24.100> bit

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220 
sounding um the jr. is a little bit

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:26.160 
sounding um the jr. is a little bit
softer<00:02:24.670> in<00:02:24.910> my<00:02:25.060> opinion<00:02:25.480> it<00:02:25.630> kind<00:02:25.900> of<00:02:25.959> has<00:02:26.140> a

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.170 
softer in my opinion it kind of has a

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:30.449 
softer in my opinion it kind of has a

00:02:30.449 --> 00:02:30.459 
more vintage and woody tone because I

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:32.280

00:04:04.309 --> 00:04:04.319 
right out of the gate I can just tell

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:06.530 
right out of the gate I can just tell
the<00:04:04.530> saying<00:04:04.830> is<00:04:05.190> more<00:04:05.550> alive<00:04:05.819> sounding<00:04:06.360> and<00:04:06.510> I

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:06.540 
the saying is more alive sounding and I

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:09.650 
the saying is more alive sounding and I
don't<00:04:06.720> know<00:04:06.870> if<00:04:07.110> it's<00:04:07.260> just<00:04:07.500> a<00:04:07.709> pickup<00:04:08.280> or<00:04:08.730> the

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:09.660 
don't know if it's just a pickup or the

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:11.510 
don't know if it's just a pickup or the
construction<00:04:10.290> because<00:04:10.500> it's<00:04:10.709> a<00:04:10.890> set<00:04:11.310> knack

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:11.520 
construction because it's a set knack

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:13.460 
construction because it's a set knack
instead<00:04:11.850> of<00:04:11.940> a<00:04:12.000> bolt<00:04:12.209> on<00:04:12.390> or<00:04:13.110> the<00:04:13.290> wood

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:13.470 
instead of a bolt on or the wood

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:16.610 
instead of a bolt on or the wood
whatever<00:04:14.209> it's<00:04:15.209> just<00:04:15.300> a<00:04:15.570> really<00:04:16.140> good<00:04:16.290> guitar

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:16.620 
whatever it's just a really good guitar

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:19.250 
whatever it's just a really good guitar
but<00:04:16.980> like<00:04:17.310> I<00:04:17.430> said<00:04:17.959> it's<00:04:18.959> a<00:04:18.989> little<00:04:19.169> more

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:19.260 
but like I said it's a little more

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.850 
but like I said it's a little more
expensive<00:04:19.410> than<00:04:19.859> this<00:04:19.950> like<00:04:20.220> this<00:04:20.400> thing<00:04:20.640> cost

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:21.860 
expensive than this like this thing cost

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:24.440 
expensive than this like this thing cost
like<00:04:22.860> ten<00:04:23.100> times<00:04:23.310> more<00:04:23.730> than<00:04:23.940> this<00:04:24.060> like<00:04:24.300> this

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:24.450 
like ten times more than this like this

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:26.030 
like ten times more than this like this
like<00:04:24.630> something<00:04:24.750> about<00:04:24.990> two<00:04:25.650> hundred<00:04:25.740> and

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:26.040 
like something about two hundred and

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:28.190 
like something about two hundred and
twenty<00:04:26.310> some<00:04:26.550> odd<00:04:26.580> bucks<00:04:26.970> after<00:04:27.390> shipping<00:04:28.020> I

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:28.200 
twenty some odd bucks after shipping I

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:30.440 
twenty some odd bucks after shipping I
think<00:04:28.830> I<00:04:28.950> think<00:04:29.130> it<00:04:29.220> was<00:04:29.310> right<00:04:29.790> at<00:04:29.910> $1.99

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:30.450 
think I think it was right at $1.99

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:33.650 
think I think it was right at $1.99
before<00:04:30.810> shipping<00:04:31.050> so<00:04:31.970> still<00:04:32.970> a<00:04:33.000> cool<00:04:33.480> guitar

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:33.660 
before shipping so still a cool guitar

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:38.750 
before shipping so still a cool guitar
it's<00:04:34.350> hard<00:04:34.650> to<00:04:35.210> compare<00:04:36.210> them<00:04:36.860> just<00:04:37.860> you<00:04:38.669> know

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:38.760 
it's hard to compare them just you know

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:41.440 
it's hard to compare them just you know
from<00:04:38.880> the<00:04:39.060> price<00:04:39.270> point<00:04:39.570> because<00:04:39.750> they<00:04:40.110> are<00:04:40.260> so

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:41.450 
from the price point because they are so

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:44.870 
from the price point because they are so
far<00:04:42.450> removed<00:04:42.600> from<00:04:42.960> one<00:04:43.140> another<00:04:43.350> but<00:04:43.880> they're

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:44.880 
far removed from one another but they're

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:46.940 
far removed from one another but they're
both<00:04:45.090> single<00:04:45.360> p90<00:04:45.870> is<00:04:45.930> they<00:04:46.080> both<00:04:46.260> really<00:04:46.710> rock
