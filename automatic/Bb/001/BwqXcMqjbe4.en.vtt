much<00:00:45.600> memory<00:00:46.020> put<00:00:46.320> into<00:00:46.649> it<00:00:46.680> so<00:00:47.399> yeah<00:00:48.059> this<00:00:48.210> is

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
much memory put into it so yeah this is

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.270 
much memory put into it so yeah this is
pretty<00:00:48.510> much<00:00:48.660> the<00:00:48.809> exterior<00:00:49.410> of<00:00:49.530> it<00:00:49.770> it's<00:00:50.129> got

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
pretty much the exterior of it it's got

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.150 
pretty much the exterior of it it's got
a<00:00:50.309> camera<00:00:50.550> here<00:00:50.879> in<00:00:50.969> the<00:00:51.059> top<00:00:51.270> left<00:00:51.510> corner<00:00:52.160> it

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
a camera here in the top left corner it

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.189 
a camera here in the top left corner it
looks<00:00:53.399> like<00:00:53.610> an<00:00:53.760> iphone<00:00:53.879> pretty<00:00:54.329> much<00:00:54.510> but

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
looks like an iphone pretty much but

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.950 
looks like an iphone pretty much but
it's<00:00:55.520> definitely<00:00:56.520> not<00:00:56.879> nothing<00:00:57.480> close<00:00:57.690> to<00:00:57.719> it

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
it's definitely not nothing close to it

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.860 
it's definitely not nothing close to it
so<00:00:58.620> why<00:00:58.890> it<00:00:58.949> is<00:00:59.160> a<00:00:59.190> bit<00:00:59.399> thicker<00:00:59.699> as<00:00:59.940> well<00:01:00.149> it's

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
so why it is a bit thicker as well it's

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.260 
so why it is a bit thicker as well it's
a<00:01:00.930> little<00:01:01.050> bit<00:01:01.260> longer<00:01:01.530> and<00:01:01.949> it's<00:01:02.460> got<00:01:02.640> the

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
a little bit longer and it's got the

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.119 
a little bit longer and it's got the
earpiece<00:01:03.660> there<00:01:03.899> and<00:01:04.439> we've<00:01:04.589> also<00:01:04.769> got<00:01:05.010> the

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
earpiece there and we've also got the

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.280 
earpiece there and we've also got the
home<00:01:05.250> button<00:01:05.430> so<00:01:05.580> let's<00:01:05.760> turn<00:01:05.939> it<00:01:06.000> on<00:01:06.240> and<00:01:06.450> here

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290
