00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:30.050

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:56.120
 the squares in damask for you as my 

00:05:53.599 --> 00:05:59.449

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:06.930
 then a man of the children of the 

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:07.409
 prophets said to his companion by word 

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:10.379
 of God

00:06:23.129 --> 00:06:27.629
 He found another man and told him and rm 

00:06:25.439 --> 00:06:30.659

00:06:27.629 --> 00:06:32.669
 He made a wound and the prophet left and 

00:06:30.659 --> 00:06:34.560
 put in front of the king on the road and he 

00:06:32.669 --> 00:06:38.219
 disguised by putting a bandage on 

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:40.620
 eyes and when the king passed he shouted 

00:06:38.219 --> 00:06:43.199
 to the king and said your servant went out in the middle 

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:45.210

00:07:04.409 --> 00:07:08.610
 suddenly the bandage over his eyes and 

00:07:06.719 --> 00:07:09.560
 the king of Israel knew that he was one of the 

00:07:08.610 --> 00:07:12.919
 prophets 

00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:14.810

00:07:12.919 --> 00:07:17.720
