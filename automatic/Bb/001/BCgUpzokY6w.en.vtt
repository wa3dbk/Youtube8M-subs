00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:19.260
 healthy and there were and lads today 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.990
 free topics once again quite a while 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:24.210
 I did not do all the plots that 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:27.480
 little time and you know now 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:29.250
 end of the school year a lot of general problems 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.160
 today we have an object susu hands on 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:34.670
 agenda and more specifically this is our 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.410
 sankom boysa instead on the map murovanka 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:39.750
 played was maybe a week or two 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:42.210
 weeks ago I store replay 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.550
 table I absolutely do not sign their date 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:47.280
 so I do not remember when this replay 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:49.140
 happened but I revised remembered and 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.840
 you will try as much as possible so 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.850
 atmospheric video make here a map 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.430
 murovka she is definitely such a template 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.449
 there is not such a big choice of position for 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.680
 medium tank 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:03.719
 but if you play a platoon then let's say 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:05.489
 variations go somewhere they become 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:07.080
 more because look around jordan 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.689
 I play with platoon Sonya 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.850
 and we press it to squares 2 that is, if 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:14.460
 would i play solo here obviously i 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.530
 probably did not risk to go here well though 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:19.530
 would be due to the fact that with action but more often 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.630
 Still, the lower base is rashid 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.689
 base on most often defy because 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.430
 more often it takes people well I hope you 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:30.509
 understand what I'm talking about that is more often 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:32.130
 total top rep goes to the greens and 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:34.200
 In general, the lower rep drives this. 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.229
 side as we see here a whole bunch 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.189
 name opponents in some way 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:39.750
 miraculously managed to kill 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:42.299
 enemy 140 I mean you 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:44.430
 with impunity him bending over 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:46.290
 I have a stabilizer drives 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.600
 I am still a supporter here 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:50.970
 the most comfortable shooting 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:54.360
 specifically for a tank object 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:56.549
 140 is awful just super like 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.920
 important because he has already 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:01.979
 good stabilization but i think that 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.990
 good characteristics need to say so a 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:06.719
 party if you can make 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:08.580
 better mixing it you need to make a soul and 

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:10.410
 so it's something I ride with 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.800
 stabilizer and actuators details 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:13.690
 just instant 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:15.490
 and it gives really colossal 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:18.190
 advantages on some such here 

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:21.070
 mountainous areas on the relief of their 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:23.770
 maps where stabilization is really important 

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:25.330
 there is a need to quickly go shoot and 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:27.760
 it does not get a splash 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:29.380
 Well, does not get a splash and it is unlikely that it 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:29.860
 goes about me because in this were 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:32.680
 a little bit 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:36.130
 snipped off from the enemy bulldog for good 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:37.630
 he will teach there shot out according to I 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:40.150
 general so now continuing more or less 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:43.000
 somehow here look out for something but saw 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:44.920
 I that he absolutely decided ohamel on him 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.510
 shoot asked sanka to that 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:48.880
 understand shot well in general we 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:51.430
 bulldog so you can already say 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:53.860
 smashed that's where my shell is now gone 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:56.680
 This of course guys at all question simply 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:57.670
 all my life where the projectile goes in the game 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:59.680
 world of tanks 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:02.020
 it always bothered me always cop 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:03.970
 the question worries because shooting 

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:05.710
 practically in the forehead there really are such 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:07.950
 cases when the projectile is flying somewhere in 

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:10.780
 the earth or he doesn't fly at all or he 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:13.270
 trassir as would be seen but not as anywhere 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:15.430
 falls visible in their effects 

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:17.170
 hitting an explosion there projectile and so on 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:19.660
 so on then but these are all guys cutters 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:21.850
 which depends very much on ping and 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:23.320
 so on so on in short not about 

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:25.209
 I'd like to talk now 

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:29.110
 I'm standing in the same position in the square 

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:31.540
 f3 and well, not very much right now for me 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:33.820
 it turns out he has discomfort 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:35.560
 smart and better yes and in principle the dynamics 

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:37.300
 the tank is not bad and as for 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:39.190
 stabilization everything is great there 

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:42.340
 british tank set there all good 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:44.470
 and I understand that her just picked up 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:47.080
 cheek is very very hard from this 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:50.410
 british and i still i just shift 

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:52.540
 there is usually a little closer to the green 

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:56.050
 because of our tanks there is not very 

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:58.300
 a lot of mouse and about something from a 8 watch 

00:03:56.050 --> 00:04:00.700
 they will soon be picked up because of 3 out of 8 

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:02.980
 they vanshot on and well , you know 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:05.530
 kill a pig does not make up any 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:08.560
 labor in general then I killed in the meantime 

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:10.360
 50100 and notices that t28 see 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:12.250
 four minutes of fighting have gone by for four 

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:13.390
 minutes from my base I was able to get to 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:16.750
 a7 square 

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:18.820
 but also the record lying watch sits on 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:20.859
 I actually understood his board 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:22.419
 I take away my fragment and accounting after that 

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:23.560
 we with sankom decide what you need somehow 

00:04:22.419 --> 00:04:25.870
 site on all 

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:28.240
 mountain powders lasted because they 

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:29.919
 all gathered in one crowd and somehow this 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:33.610
 not at all right away because they themselves 

00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:35.770
 you know that the crowd is always always something 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:38.139
 decides in battle especially if it's a mob 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:40.840
 autist which breaks others there 

00:04:38.139 --> 00:04:42.820
 shoot from the bushes shorter talk with 

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:45.730
 someone to us because very little is very soon 

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:48.070
 there will die well and there on the flank itself 

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:50.260
 understand himself wafer guides embroidered Barshchina 

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:52.419
 In short, not everything is as good as 

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:54.040
 I would like though the score is 97 and by 

00:04:52.419 --> 00:04:57.310
 positions we win yes and in principle 

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:58.840
 fear nothing but there are still two 

00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:00.669
 artillery who terrible me 

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:04.419
 worried so i always ask to 

00:05:00.669 --> 00:05:07.000
 then drove through the square to more precisely but by 

00:05:04.419 --> 00:05:09.070
 towards the very give time while he 

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:11.889
 I was driving, I decided to still glow for the house 

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:14.320
 due to the fact that in the t-54 maybe suddenly a 

00:05:11.889 --> 00:05:15.970
 somehow prove and rest on me but 

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:19.090
 very meanwhile sledge already 

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:21.160
 moved waited i waited waited i waited for 

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:23.139
 trace in short salute a little bit 

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:25.330
 I flashed my son and somehow it all started 

00:05:23.139 --> 00:05:27.220
 so artistic but after a second 

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:31.000
 I started to go and I noticed the enemy 

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:33.280
 borscht borsch and not stupid and snarls sledge 

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.840
 we will not leave screaming finish me finish me 

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:37.240
 I can't finish him off because he stands 

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:38.680
 over the hill and me its just really almost 

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:41.229
 not visible that is, there is little literally 

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:41.740
 A little field of arable land sticks out in which to get 

00:05:41.229 --> 00:05:43.840
 region 

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:46.930
 Well, it is difficult because there all threw off 

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:47.340
 artillery in general is-7 t-54 and shorter 

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:51.520
 wag 

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:54.669
 dies after all this all this 

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:57.100
 horror t-54 rode for yes oh naturally 

00:05:54.669 --> 00:06:00.190
 sin is not a sin not to get on Naquin 

00:05:57.100 --> 00:06:01.990
 Soviet ass I go through solidarity and 

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:05.229
 random guys this is random 

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:07.900
 there are no brothers 

00:06:05.229 --> 00:06:10.030
 but I took the fifth frag and the next one 

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:11.830
 Generally the firefly mx 30 takes over 

00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:14.500
 Sanka's role is very so-so 

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:16.510
 passive very active firefly well i 

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:19.510
 In general, then again, we are waiting for out 

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:22.180
 while he 'll shine I guys are here of course 

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:24.039
 stupid could of course I save them life 

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:27.580
 to your own co-op 

00:06:24.039 --> 00:06:30.100
 that I vanshotny can justify me here 

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:31.990
 the big one perishes in general and I am very 

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:33.789
 I want a warrior straight just burning with desire 

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:35.470
 take a warrior I understand that I have 

00:06:33.789 --> 00:06:36.940
 opportunities to take winona practically 

00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:40.210
 see them not yes because 

00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:43.120
 this m40 will soon be taken away on the right I see 

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:44.410
 I thought seriously but 40 41 but 

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:47.020
 I see a patch from and 

00:06:44.410 --> 00:06:48.460
 and on the blessing I take my sixth fragment there 

00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:51.580
 I take sign klassnosti Th 

00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:52.440
 white medal let's see what all 

00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:55.360
 is over 

00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:57.280
 familiar erasing and in this you didn't take your 

00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:59.740
 First Degree Badge and Medal 

00:06:57.280 --> 00:07:01.690
 Bruno also support old age and then 

00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:04.660
 and so on so on commands result 

00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:06.970
 5,700 homes which by the way ca n’t fail me 

00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:10.210
 please also threw in 9 thousand of damage 

00:07:06.970 --> 00:07:10.960
 more precisely sankom squandered on a platoon and 9000 

00:07:10.210 --> 00:07:13.060
 there are mages 

00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:15.370
 it was not in the top that is, it was 

00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:17.440
 the level of the battlefield is 10 

00:07:15.370 --> 00:07:19.450
 There were nine eights short in 

00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:23.230
 This level of battle in 9000 for two is 

00:07:19.450 --> 00:07:25.480
 very good i personally crayfish to 5 743 200 

00:07:23.230 --> 00:07:27.940
 in short, not bad here is such a fight 

00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:30.250
