let's<00:00:01.170> just<00:00:01.319> say<00:00:03.230> person<00:00:04.279> on<00:00:05.279> a<00:00:05.339> computer<00:00:07.069> true

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:08.069 
let's just say person on a computer true

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:13.220 
let's just say person on a computer true
created<00:00:08.820> this<00:00:09.000> world<00:00:11.030> we<00:00:12.030> can<00:00:12.210> never<00:00:12.389> see<00:00:13.200> that

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
created this world we can never see that

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.910 
created this world we can never see that
person<00:00:13.679> I<00:00:14.219> computer<00:00:15.199> America<00:00:16.199> how<00:00:16.650> much

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
person I computer America how much

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.120 
person I computer America how much
technology<00:00:17.279> we<00:00:17.970> come<00:00:18.210> up<00:00:18.420> with<00:00:19.130> another

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
technology we come up with another

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.140 
technology we come up with another
person<00:00:20.490> on<00:00:21.199> the<00:00:22.199> computer<00:00:23.130> created<00:00:23.850> that

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
person on the computer created that

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:29.509 
person on the computer created that
person<00:00:24.869> and<00:00:25.220> then<00:00:26.220> definitely<00:00:27.170> speaking<00:00:28.519> so

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
person and then definitely speaking so

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:35.450 
person and then definitely speaking so
we're<00:00:30.179> in<00:00:30.560> infinite<00:00:31.759> virtual<00:00:32.759> worlds<00:00:34.460> with

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
we're in infinite virtual worlds with

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:42.380 
we're in infinite virtual worlds with
infinite<00:00:36.180> on<00:00:39.200> creations<00:00:40.200> to<00:00:41.100> the<00:00:41.250> start<00:00:41.670> which

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
infinite on creations to the start which

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.130 
infinite on creations to the start which
is<00:00:42.600> where<00:00:42.870> the<00:00:43.290> question<00:00:43.980> is<00:00:44.160> how<00:00:44.340> we<00:00:44.399> get

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:45.140 
is where the question is how we get

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:49.610 
is where the question is how we get
nothing<00:00:46.140> how<00:00:47.129> something<00:00:47.820> or<00:00:48.110> it's<00:00:49.110> just<00:00:49.260> not

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
nothing how something or it's just not

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:55.270 
nothing how something or it's just not
that<00:00:49.649> exciting<00:00:50.520> this<00:00:51.329> is<00:00:51.629> it<00:00:52.789> but<00:00:53.789> that

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:55.280 
that exciting this is it but that

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:58.779 
that exciting this is it but that
discussion<00:00:56.280> bring<00:00:56.640> me<00:00:56.820> to<00:00:57.059> the<00:00:57.329> topic<00:00:57.629> of

00:00:58.779 --> 00:00:58.789 
discussion bring me to the topic of

00:00:58.789 --> 00:01:03.910 
discussion bring me to the topic of
aliens<00:00:59.789> and<00:01:00.120> ufos<00:01:00.719> in<00:01:01.170> the<00:01:02.010> fact<00:01:02.460> that<00:01:02.640> what<00:01:03.030> if

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:03.920 
aliens and ufos in the fact that what if

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:07.580 
aliens and ufos in the fact that what if
most<00:01:04.920> UFOs<00:01:05.610> and<00:01:05.939> aliens<00:01:06.420> we<00:01:06.570> can't<00:01:07.049> even<00:01:07.380> see

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
most UFOs and aliens we can't even see

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.469 
most UFOs and aliens we can't even see
them<00:01:07.860> just<00:01:08.100> like<00:01:08.310> the<00:01:08.520> person<00:01:08.729> i<00:01:09.000> prayed<00:01:09.299> this

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
them just like the person i prayed this

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:13.700 
them just like the person i prayed this
world<00:01:10.010> no<00:01:11.010> matter<00:01:11.040> how<00:01:11.670> much<00:01:12.000> technology<00:01:12.840> we

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
world no matter how much technology we

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:18.560 
world no matter how much technology we
come<00:01:13.979> up<00:01:14.159> with<00:01:14.930> we<00:01:15.930> can<00:01:16.170> never<00:01:17.119> read<00:01:18.119> on<00:01:18.299> this

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
come up with we can never read on this

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:24.020 
come up with we can never read on this
in<00:01:18.869> there<00:01:19.140> everywhere<00:01:19.970> yeah<00:01:21.650> so<00:01:22.729> we<00:01:23.729> have<00:01:23.850> that

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
in there everywhere yeah so we have that

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.770 
in there everywhere yeah so we have that
and<00:01:24.390> then<00:01:24.570> we<00:01:25.049> have<00:01:25.200> partial<00:01:26.630> within<00:01:27.630> this

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
and then we have partial within this

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.090 
and then we have partial within this
reality<00:01:28.049> or<00:01:28.530> may<00:01:28.740> we<00:01:28.770> could<00:01:29.100> feel<00:01:30.920> then<00:01:31.920> we

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
reality or may we could feel then we

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.219 
reality or may we could feel then we
have<00:01:32.189> ones<00:01:32.490> are<00:01:32.700> physically<00:01:33.479> in<00:01:33.600> the<00:01:33.630> reality

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
have ones are physically in the reality

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:38.300 
have ones are physically in the reality
like<00:01:34.530> own<00:01:35.090> the<00:01:36.090> UFOs<00:01:36.930> and<00:01:37.320> all<00:01:37.470> that<00:01:37.740> whether

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
like own the UFOs and all that whether

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.109 
like own the UFOs and all that whether
you<00:01:38.520> believe<00:01:38.790> or<00:01:38.850> not<00:01:39.030> it's<00:01:39.659> a<00:01:39.979> unimportant

00:01:41.109 --> 00:01:41.119 
you believe or not it's a unimportant

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:43.639 
you believe or not it's a unimportant
but<00:01:42.119> my<00:01:42.360> whole<00:01:42.570> points<00:01:43.049> that<00:01:43.229> we're<00:01:43.409> dealing

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
but my whole points that we're dealing

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:48.370 
but my whole points that we're dealing
with<00:01:45.200> infinite<00:01:46.520> creations<00:01:47.520> by<00:01:47.759> people<00:01:48.180> on

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:48.380 
with infinite creations by people on

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:55.359 
with infinite creations by people on
computers<00:01:49.380> in<00:01:51.439> maybe<00:01:52.439> a<00:01:52.560> virtual<00:01:53.490> reality

00:01:55.359 --> 00:01:55.369 
computers in maybe a virtual reality

00:01:55.369 --> 00:01:58.069 
computers in maybe a virtual reality
maybe<00:01:56.369> even<00:01:56.640> created<00:01:57.119> by<00:01:57.240> robots<00:01:57.810> on

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
maybe even created by robots on

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:03.950 
maybe even created by robots on
computers<00:01:59.210> so<00:02:00.210> i<00:02:00.630> think<00:02:00.810> it<00:02:01.259> makes<00:02:01.560> the<00:02:02.960> UFO

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
computers so i think it makes the UFO

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.940 
computers so i think it makes the UFO
situation<00:02:04.700> very<00:02:05.810> complicated<00:02:06.810> from<00:02:07.469> that

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
situation very complicated from that

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.530 
situation very complicated from that
perspective<00:02:09.200> i'll<00:02:10.200> come<00:02:10.530> up<00:02:10.560> with<00:02:10.890> the<00:02:11.009> part

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:11.540 
perspective i'll come up with the part

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:14.289 
perspective i'll come up with the part
hopefully<00:02:12.200> but<00:02:13.040> thank<00:02:13.340> you<00:02:13.489> for<00:02:13.519> watching<00:02:14.209> and

00:02:14.289 --> 00:02:14.299 
hopefully but thank you for watching and

00:02:14.299 --> 00:02:16.930 
hopefully but thank you for watching and
have<00:02:14.450> a<00:02:14.480> good<00:02:14.750> day
