cords<00:00:05.840> of<00:00:05.960> Orion<00:00:06.050> I<00:00:06.560> love<00:00:07.399> it<00:00:07.580> when<00:00:07.790> the

00:00:07.929 --> 00:00:07.939 
cords of Orion I love it when the

00:00:07.939 --> 00:00:10.509 
cords of Orion I love it when the
unexpected<00:00:08.660> occurs<00:00:09.170> during<00:00:09.559> the<00:00:09.740> process<00:00:10.280> of

unexpected occurs during the process of

00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:13.090 
unexpected occurs during the process of

writing and recording music that
happened<00:00:13.400> to<00:00:13.460> me<00:00:13.580> this<00:00:13.700> week<00:00:13.940> thought<00:00:14.390> I'd

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:14.540 
happened to me this week thought I'd

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:16.330

share it with you real quick see if it

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:18.790 
share it with you real quick see if it
provides<00:00:16.580> some<00:00:16.880> value<00:00:17.300> to<00:00:17.510> you<00:00:17.779> in<00:00:18.050> your

provides some value to you in your
recording<00:00:19.789> process<00:00:20.500> anyway<00:00:21.500> I<00:00:21.530> was<00:00:22.150> creating

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:23.150 
recording process anyway I was creating

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:24.940 
recording process anyway I was creating
and<00:00:23.390> recording<00:00:23.869> a<00:00:23.930> guitar<00:00:24.289> part<00:00:24.560> this<00:00:24.740> week

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:24.950 
and recording a guitar part this week

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:27.540 
and recording a guitar part this week
using<00:00:25.640> my<00:00:25.820> Telecaster<00:00:26.510> baritone<00:00:26.900> guitar<00:00:26.930> I

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:27.550 
using my Telecaster baritone guitar I

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:31.960 
using my Telecaster baritone guitar I
decided<00:00:28.550> to<00:00:28.789> add<00:00:28.940> a<00:00:29.390> 4<00:00:29.810> second<00:00:30.289> delay<00:00:30.850> onto<00:00:31.850> the

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:31.970 
decided to add a 4 second delay onto the

that old school band anyhow after I
recorded<00:01:16.680> it<00:01:16.830> I<00:01:16.980> decided<00:01:17.460> I<00:01:17.640> needed<00:01:17.670> something

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
recorded it I decided I needed something

convolution<00:01:25.200> reverb<00:01:25.380> and<00:01:26.300> I<00:01:27.300> went<00:01:27.570> to<00:01:27.870> the<00:01:28.080> IR

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:28.440 
convolution reverb and I went to the IR

convolution reverb and I went to the IR
sample<00:01:29.600> IR<00:01:30.600> samples<00:01:31.050> that<00:01:31.170> come<00:01:31.380> with<00:01:31.620> the

plug-in these are the impulse response
samples<00:01:35.240> that<00:01:36.240> provide<00:01:36.660> the<00:01:36.869> reverb<00:01:37.410> and<00:01:38.030> I

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
samples that provide the reverb and I

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.660 
samples that provide the reverb and I
kind<00:01:39.540> of<00:01:39.660> focused<00:01:40.020> on<00:01:40.200> one<00:01:40.680> called<00:01:41.070> space<00:01:41.400> comm

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
kind of focused on one called space comm

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.170 
kind of focused on one called space comm
it's<00:01:41.940> a<00:01:42.030> seven<00:01:42.390> second<00:01:42.979> impulse<00:01:43.979> so<00:01:44.850> a<00:01:44.880> pretty

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
it's a seven second impulse so a pretty

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.749 
it's a seven second impulse so a pretty
long<00:01:45.390> reverb<00:01:45.690> tail<00:01:46.140> and<00:01:46.440> it's<00:01:47.040> it<00:01:47.430> sounds

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
long reverb tail and it's it sounds

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.969 
long reverb tail and it's it sounds
pretty<00:01:47.970> nice<00:01:48.150> so<00:01:49.080> I<00:01:49.110> pulled<00:01:49.410> that<00:01:49.530> into<00:01:49.860> the

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
pretty nice so I pulled that into the

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.219 
pretty nice so I pulled that into the
plug-in<00:01:50.220> did<00:01:51.210> a<00:01:51.240> little<00:01:51.660> bit<00:01:51.780> of<00:01:51.869> massaging

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
plug-in did a little bit of massaging

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.950 
plug-in did a little bit of massaging
with<00:01:52.920> the<00:01:53.220> volume<00:01:53.729> envelope<00:01:54.360> here<00:01:54.630> you<00:01:54.810> can

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
with the volume envelope here you can

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.139 
with the volume envelope here you can
see<00:01:55.110> it<00:01:55.229> tails<00:01:55.530> off<00:01:55.860> towards<00:01:56.369> the<00:01:56.460> end<00:01:56.729> to

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
see it tails off towards the end to

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:59.870 
see it tails off towards the end to
provide<00:01:57.930> a<00:01:57.960> nice<00:01:58.200> tail<00:01:58.680> in<00:01:59.100> the<00:01:59.310> volume<00:01:59.700> of<00:01:59.820> the

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
provide a nice tail in the volume of the

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.200 
provide a nice tail in the volume of the
reverb<00:02:00.240> and<00:02:00.450> then<00:02:01.200> the<00:02:01.350> filter<00:02:02.060> we've<00:02:03.060> got

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
reverb and then the filter we've got

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:06.170 
reverb and then the filter we've got
that<00:02:03.420> set<00:02:03.750> to<00:02:04.050> kind<00:02:04.560> of<00:02:04.680> roll<00:02:05.610> off<00:02:05.640> the<00:02:05.850> high

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
that set to kind of roll off the high

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:10.340 
that set to kind of roll off the high
end<00:02:06.479> as<00:02:06.780> the<00:02:07.200> reverb<00:02:07.530> dies<00:02:07.890> out<00:02:08.690> also<00:02:09.690> adjusted

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:10.350 
end as the reverb dies out also adjusted

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:12.740

to EQ rolled off the low end a little

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:15.680 
to EQ rolled off the low end a little

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
bit roll off a little bit of mids let me

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:18.610 
bit roll off a little bit of mids let me
go<00:02:15.810> ahead<00:02:15.870> and<00:02:16.049> reset<00:02:16.380> that<00:02:16.620> here<00:02:16.920> and<00:02:17.510> then

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
go ahead and reset that here and then

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:22.220 
go ahead and reset that here and then
what<00:02:19.620> I<00:02:19.650> did<00:02:19.950> at<00:02:20.459> that<00:02:20.790> point<00:02:21.209> was<00:02:21.540> check<00:02:22.110> it

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
what I did at that point was check it

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:24.500 
what I did at that point was check it
out<00:02:22.380> with<00:02:22.709> my<00:02:23.220> guitar<00:02:23.430> part<00:02:23.850> so<00:02:24.060> let's<00:02:24.209> do<00:02:24.390> the

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
out with my guitar part so let's do the

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:30.309 
out with my guitar part so let's do the

based on what I discovered with this
particular<00:03:35.489> reverb<00:03:35.819> setting<00:03:36.290> here's<00:03:37.290> a

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:37.410 
particular reverb setting here's a

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:40.009 
particular reverb setting here's a
different<00:03:38.160> part<00:03:38.400> of<00:03:38.519> the<00:03:38.580> guitar<00:03:39.269> part<00:03:39.780> where

it's<00:03:40.140> really<00:03:40.410> just<00:03:40.530> kind<00:03:40.680> of<00:03:40.799> a<00:03:40.890> bass<00:03:41.099> line

00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:41.459 
it's really just kind of a bass line

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:49.540
