think<00:02:53.109> Westbrook<00:02:53.950> was<00:02:54.340> a<00:02:54.370> little<00:02:54.819> too<00:02:55.569> much<00:02:55.720> to

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:55.930 
think Westbrook was a little too much to

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:58.500 
think Westbrook was a little too much to
handle<00:02:56.170> man<00:02:56.560> Westbrook<00:02:57.040> was<00:02:57.299> player<00:02:58.299> of<00:02:58.329> the
