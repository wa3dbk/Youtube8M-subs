sneaking in four days and the way I do
it<00:01:06.290> you<00:01:07.290> have<00:01:07.439> a<00:01:07.470> really<00:01:07.799> good<00:01:07.890> chance<00:01:07.950> of

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
it you have a really good chance of

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.760 
it you have a really good chance of
winning<00:01:08.340> like<00:01:08.820> I<00:01:09.330> didn't<00:01:09.810> lose<00:01:09.930> you<00:01:10.260> could<00:01:10.380> see

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
winning like I didn't lose you could see

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.340 
winning like I didn't lose you could see
it<00:01:10.979> every<00:01:11.369> day<00:01:11.400> I<00:01:11.520> would<00:01:11.820> make<00:01:11.970> 400<00:01:12.659> to<00:01:12.720> 600<00:01:12.990> ml

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350

it every day I would make 400 to 600 ml
pretty<00:01:13.619> much<00:01:13.830> because<00:01:14.390> it<00:01:15.390> was<00:01:15.509> just<00:01:15.659> that

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
pretty much because it was just that

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.179 
pretty much because it was just that
easy<00:01:16.020> for<00:01:16.409> me<00:01:17.030> so<00:01:18.030> that's<00:01:18.720> my<00:01:18.990> bank<00:01:19.229> bid<00:01:19.470> so

say you stake 20 ml and you lose you
stake<00:01:54.570> for<00:01:54.810> DML<00:01:55.200> if<00:01:55.380> you<00:01:55.829> win<00:01:56.039> that<00:01:56.070> you<00:01:56.490> go

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
stake for DML if you win that you go

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.399 
stake for DML if you win that you go
back<00:01:56.820> to<00:01:56.850> 20<00:01:57.299> is<00:01:57.390> you<00:01:57.509> always<00:01:57.810> start<00:01:58.020> at<00:01:58.140> 20

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
back to 20 is you always start at 20

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:01.700 
back to 20 is you always start at 20
stay<00:01:58.740> at<00:01:58.860> 20<00:01:59.220> when<00:01:59.819> you<00:01:59.939> lose<00:02:00.149> 20<00:02:00.600> you<00:02:01.079> go<00:02:01.200> to<00:02:01.259> 40

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
stay at 20 when you lose 20 you go to 40
