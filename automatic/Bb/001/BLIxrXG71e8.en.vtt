say I like it's it's a little more
subtle<00:00:41.230> than<00:00:41.620> the<00:00:42.040> medium<00:00:42.340> we<00:00:42.460> saw<00:00:42.610> which<00:00:42.730> was

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:42.880 
subtle than the medium we saw which was

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:45.360 
subtle than the medium we saw which was
pink<00:00:43.149> and<00:00:43.300> had<00:00:43.510> me<00:00:43.750> killing<00:00:44.110> big<00:00:44.320> legends<00:00:44.829> that

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:45.370 
pink and had me killing big legends that

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:48.180 
pink and had me killing big legends that
was<00:00:45.550> still<00:00:45.940> fairly<00:00:46.390> obvious<00:00:46.870> oh<00:00:47.290> yeah<00:00:47.680> looks

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:48.190 
was still fairly obvious oh yeah looks

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:52.410 
was still fairly obvious oh yeah looks
wise<00:00:48.340> I<00:00:48.820> think<00:00:49.149> this<00:00:49.270> one<00:00:49.480> wins<00:00:49.750> although<00:00:51.420> I'd

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:52.420 
wise I think this one wins although I'd

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:53.819 
wise I think this one wins although I'd
probably<00:00:52.480> put<00:00:52.899> a<00:00:52.960> small<00:00:53.290> picture<00:00:53.500> of<00:00:53.649> you<00:00:53.800> in

they<00:01:55.779> keep<00:01:55.929> pointing<00:01:56.289> out<00:01:56.409> is<00:01:56.439> the<00:01:56.619> fact<00:01:56.649> that

00:01:56.879 --> 00:01:56.889 
they keep pointing out is the fact that

00:01:56.889 --> 00:01:59.039 
they keep pointing out is the fact that
it's<00:01:57.069> got<00:01:57.159> a<00:01:57.340> numeric<00:01:57.849> keyboard<00:01:58.119> so<00:01:58.689> whereas

00:01:59.039 --> 00:01:59.049 
it's got a numeric keyboard so whereas

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:01.440 
it's got a numeric keyboard so whereas
most<00:01:59.169> let<00:01:59.380> Alps<00:01:59.679> just<00:01:59.919> have<00:02:00.099> one<00:02:00.729> to<00:02:00.939> nine<00:02:01.119> or

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:01.450 
most let Alps just have one to nine or

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:02.969 
most let Alps just have one to nine or
want<00:02:01.599> to<00:02:01.659> see<00:02:01.840> our<00:02:01.869> low-cost<00:02:02.229> there<00:02:02.619> this<00:02:02.799> does

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:02.979 
want to see our low-cost there this does

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:05.519 
want to see our low-cost there this does
in<00:02:03.069> fact<00:02:03.159> have<00:02:03.399> a<00:02:03.579> numeric<00:02:04.060> keyboard<00:02:04.529> however

00:02:05.519 --> 00:02:05.529 
in fact have a numeric keyboard however

00:02:05.529 --> 00:02:07.469 
in fact have a numeric keyboard however
that<00:02:05.950> does<00:02:06.700> mean<00:02:06.939> that<00:02:06.969> they've<00:02:07.179> had<00:02:07.209> to

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:07.479 
that does mean that they've had to

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:08.940 
that does mean that they've had to
shrink<00:02:07.630> down<00:02:07.810> things<00:02:08.259> like<00:02:08.410> the<00:02:08.500> shift<00:02:08.739> button

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:08.950
