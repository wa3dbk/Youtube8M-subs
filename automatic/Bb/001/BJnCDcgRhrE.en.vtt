explanations of natural events for

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.700 
explanations of natural events for
example<00:01:05.280> the<00:01:06.240> astronomer<00:01:06.870> Edmund<00:01:07.440> Halley

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.010 
example the astronomer Edmund Halley
took<00:01:08.220> the<00:01:08.400> terror<00:01:08.670> out<00:01:08.880> of<00:01:09.090> comets<00:01:09.510> appearing

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
took the terror out of comets appearing

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.890 
took the terror out of comets appearing
in<00:01:10.170> the<00:01:10.290> sky<00:01:10.560> he<00:01:11.430> used<00:01:11.670> math<00:01:11.970> to<00:01:12.000> calculate<00:01:12.240> the

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
in the sky he used math to calculate the

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.940 
in the sky he used math to calculate the
length<00:01:13.050> of<00:01:13.350> one<00:01:13.650> comet's<00:01:14.130> orbit<00:01:14.750> 76<00:01:15.750> years<00:01:16.200> he

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
length of one comet's orbit 76 years he

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.530 
length of one comet's orbit 76 years he
was<00:01:17.100> then<00:01:17.340> able<00:01:17.580> to<00:01:17.910> predict<00:01:18.210> that<00:01:18.390> the

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
was then able to predict that the

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.360 
was then able to predict that the
comment<00:01:19.020> would<00:01:19.230> appear<00:01:19.530> in<00:01:19.650> certain<00:01:19.890> years

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:20.370 
comment would appear in certain years

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:23.420 
comment would appear in certain years
and<00:01:20.640> it<00:01:21.030> did<00:01:21.380> such<00:01:22.380> a<00:01:22.410> reasonable<00:01:22.890> explanation

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
and it did such a reasonable explanation

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.370 
and it did such a reasonable explanation
showed<00:01:24.090> that<00:01:24.390> there<00:01:24.570> was<00:01:24.720> no<00:01:25.020> connection

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
showed that there was no connection

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.730 
showed that there was no connection
between<00:01:26.070> the<00:01:26.430> comet<00:01:26.820> and<00:01:26.970> human<00:01:27.390> events<00:01:27.740> seen

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
between the comet and human events seen

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.190 
between the comet and human events seen
in<00:01:28.920> this<00:01:29.070> way<00:01:29.360> natural<00:01:30.360> events<00:01:30.690> became<00:01:30.930> much

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
in this way natural events became much

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.320 
in this way natural events became much
less<00:01:31.440> frightening<00:01:31.800> and<00:01:32.160> so<00:01:32.370> petitions<00:01:32.880> began

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:33.330 
less frightening and so petitions began

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:34.730 
less frightening and so petitions began
to<00:01:33.540> fail

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
to fail

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.410 
to fail

the new scientific explanations of
nature<00:01:37.840> began<00:01:38.259> to<00:01:38.439> affect<00:01:38.740> some<00:01:38.920> people's
