00:00:07.009 --> 00:00:11.900
 yes hello together to another 

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:14.059
 let's play off the place for us 2014 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:15.320
 We continue to order from Chandra 

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:17.600
 if I understood correctly and 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:20.410
 we are now trying the meeting 

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:23.690
 to defeat rolland zombies 

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:25.520
 and yes I do not want to somehow 

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:26.810
 It was about playing baroque now 

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:30.520
 the chandra deck we have the chandra 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:33.230
 deck it will continue in any case 

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:37.699
 peep encounters times there were already in 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:40.280
 last short on simple smokers and there 

00:00:37.699 --> 00:00:42.019
 Come I draw countries and yes in the 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:44.899
 it was typical that the 

00:00:42.019 --> 00:00:46.729
 opponents in a particular scheme always 

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:48.469
 so the same cards always lays when 

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:49.699
 We would restart the opponent 

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:50.960
 always the same cards in 

00:00:49.699 --> 00:00:52.670
 Laying same sequence 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:55.190
 I think that's the way it is here now 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:58.100
 and yes you zombies something with 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:01:00.309
 zombies always go with the 3 0 everything 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:02.690
 clear 

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:06.049
 maybe again shortly to our hand 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:07.430
 because it's the second wonderful so we 

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:09.740
 We also have a fact we can 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:11.450
 packed the incendiary already lies 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:15.620
 in the pieces people shoot the 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:17.680
 Phoenix for 442 flying in flames 

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:19.820
 very cool shoots a damage to two 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:23.420
 each stood on creature or player 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:25.790
 and then a laves face for five 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:27.500
 yes we want to aggressively play ours 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:28.010
 hand, I think that leaves it just fine 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:30.650
 to 

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:31.670
 I'm permanently on it now, too 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:34.220
 Maybe we do not know 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:38.000
 opponent permanently only picks up on it or 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:40.430
 Sweet Grabko escalated in English 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.600
 But it says yes sausage and yes we 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:46.490
 start the race with a hit for 1 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:47.560
 but now beats double what 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:51.820
 I know 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:51.820
 I do not know everything yet 

00:01:53.760 --> 00:02:00.250
 we play aggressively, we are that 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:01.630
 bernbeck we want to profit faster than 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:03.760
 the enemy is why I buy here now 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:06.640
 not from here comes for two of the 22nd 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:08.940
 the walking corpse is also right for me 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:08.940
 his 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:15.700
 no country moved 

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:17.470
 yes i believe in any case offer 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:20.530
 here the exchange in any case should 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:23.530
 He quietly makes exchange for the fiend 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:26.230
 from ok takes a bit of pressure from 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:28.090
 field freshman at the second 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:31.330
 incendiary life points beautiful 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:33.370
 balanced both at 18 now 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:35.250
 very much the third and best too 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:36.850
 to follow the fourth country 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:39.420
 in fact , in our review 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:42.120
 to have a fifth country someday 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:44.320
 here I take the exchange in any case 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:46.450
 watch what he lays for three men 

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:48.070
 namely if he lays a lord is the 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:50.530
 google equal to 33 then we can 

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:52.110
 not exchange one to one from 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:56.200
 like to shoot at a creature 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:58.930
 a song mama dingo what he is now 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:00.220
 puts three, so he is nothing 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:02.800
 pity I would like the flames of the 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:05.530
 Hitzkopf used to somehow something 

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:07.810
 Shooting away could not know that 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:09.190
 now necessarily the land pull so 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:11.140
 just keep us in bernsfeld 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:13.840
 open can not hurt 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:15.040
 There does not look like bad 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:17.920
 it can not look bad is not 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:21.970
 on the field except our little goblin 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:24.070
 megannem of fire puts so turn 4 what 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:29.260
 make the mall a zombies in this 

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:30.459
 meeting in kouvola speak picks up 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:35.020
 the google he wears again 

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:39.130
 plays out I guess times no, the 

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:41.840
 walking corpse ok here we go 

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:44.180
 look what phoenix would i say 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:46.670
 continue building pressure with hurry is okay 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:49.489
 I also offer the exchange again 

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:51.230
 our goblin against the 22 he should be me 

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:53.030
 Be right there will be for the 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:55.760
 harm people in the air quite well 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:57.290
 that would make us ourselves 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:01.370
 Do two damage with the boule 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:02.510
 we are right in any case 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:05.150
 especially because we are with the flames of the 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:07.940
 Hitzkopf may be equally enjoyable 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:10.069
 Swap to at least one 

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:12.530
 one of the cards here and in the new one 

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:14.410
 damage to my face should shoot me 

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:16.850
 be right 

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:21.320
 Of course, endless rows of death are hard 

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:23.660
 when parting always to the beat opens all 

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:25.130
 To see the short half is rounded 

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:27.610
 okay so he gets one at another 

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:27.610
 Nothing 

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:33.550
 sayings can quietly live the phoenix 

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:36.800
 can definitely put in phoenix 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:38.479
 he has no zombie so enough 

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:40.039
 it from next round 

00:04:38.479 --> 00:04:43.310
 Shoot the zombies off 

00:04:40.039 --> 00:04:44.539
 do not multiply so blatantly and after 

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:45.800
 Let's play the fans round of course 

00:04:44.539 --> 00:04:48.350
 earlier so the next round for four 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:51.530
 definitely can hit one 

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:52.940
 potential danger or ding here 

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:54.770
 first seen nothing against the 

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:59.180
 Of course, trigger went on the stack 

00:04:54.770 --> 00:05:00.820
 but rounded off by the half of 05 

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:05.120
 is still 0 

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:07.070
 I do not want to take this blog 

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:10.400
 about the two harm we have beautiful 

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:16.639
 word the corpse walking her so clearly 

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:18.470
 that comes the fifth time 

00:05:16.639 --> 00:05:19.820
 we could also use the flame cone 

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:22.340
 exchange properly 

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:23.680
 So I would like to hurt 

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:26.120
 shoot the player 

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:27.500
 I would like to break the two 

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:29.990
 shoot a force and the three 

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:33.370
 also harm a creature nicely 

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:35.960
 the card 1 to 2000 in the middle of the face 

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:37.700
 so you want such burns catfish of course 

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:38.570
 play for quasi cards advantage too 

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:40.039
 earn 

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:41.960
 Of course you can also use red or 

00:05:40.039 --> 00:05:42.650
 black with the models cards advantage 

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:45.110
 create 

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:47.119
 you do not necessarily have to go blue 

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:49.979
 play 

00:05:47.119 --> 00:05:52.379
 Gaddafi was a very solid country hothead 

00:05:49.979 --> 00:05:53.699
 make the bag to yourself in any case 

00:05:52.379 --> 00:05:56.069
 if somehow the board cleared but 

00:05:53.699 --> 00:06:00.719
 that will not happen because he himself 

00:05:56.069 --> 00:06:04.110
 somehow on mass plays 5 in the face 

00:06:00.719 --> 00:06:07.739
 just for fun fun 

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:10.610
 old texas caught yes that was the 

00:06:07.739 --> 00:06:12.809
 meeting against the murders of zombies 

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:14.309
 WCM we inferno leads all 

00:06:12.809 --> 00:06:17.899
 6 damage all creatures 

00:06:14.309 --> 00:06:20.969
 rather not 

00:06:17.899 --> 00:06:23.099
 no, even that was the encounter against 

00:06:20.969 --> 00:06:24.959
 The mall of zombies in the next video 

00:06:23.099 --> 00:06:27.959
 is it against the sg uster 

00:06:24.959 --> 00:06:29.099
 Cultists and yes I have the video through 

00:06:27.959 --> 00:06:32.569
 I like you and everyone 

00:06:29.099 --> 00:06:32.569
 Have a nice day until the next
