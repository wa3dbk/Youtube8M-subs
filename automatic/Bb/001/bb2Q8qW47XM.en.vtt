so<00:00:00.240> once<00:00:00.420> you<00:00:00.570> have<00:00:00.659> your<00:00:00.840> tower<00:00:01.110> leveled<00:00:01.680> and

00:00:01.969 --> 00:00:01.979 
so once you have your tower leveled and

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:04.070 
so once you have your tower leveled and
in<00:00:02.070> a<00:00:02.159> dry<00:00:02.370> place<00:00:02.429> you<00:00:03.330> can<00:00:03.449> add<00:00:03.600> your<00:00:03.750> potting

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:04.080 
in a dry place you can add your potting

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:09.860 
in a dry place you can add your potting
mix<00:00:07.670> we<00:00:08.670> go<00:00:08.849> into<00:00:09.150> a<00:00:09.179> lot<00:00:09.360> of<00:00:09.389> detail<00:00:09.840> on

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:09.870 
mix we go into a lot of detail on

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.150 
mix we go into a lot of detail on
potting<00:00:10.440> mixes<00:00:10.769> online<00:00:11.300> but<00:00:12.300> basically<00:00:13.170> the

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
potting mixes online but basically the

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.670 
potting mixes online but basically the
lighter<00:00:14.429> the<00:00:14.549> mix<00:00:14.910> you<00:00:15.059> can<00:00:15.179> find<00:00:15.540> the<00:00:16.500> better

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
lighter the mix you can find the better

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.620 
lighter the mix you can find the better
it's<00:00:16.859> going<00:00:16.949> to<00:00:17.010> be<00:00:17.070> for<00:00:17.400> the<00:00:17.460> tower<00:00:17.670> because

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
it's going to be for the tower because

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.240 
it's going to be for the tower because
you<00:00:19.260> can<00:00:19.410> keep<00:00:19.529> the<00:00:19.710> weight<00:00:19.859> of<00:00:20.039> the<00:00:20.100> tower

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
you can keep the weight of the tower

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.640 
you can keep the weight of the tower
down<00:00:20.609> when<00:00:21.330> you<00:00:21.449> need<00:00:21.630> to<00:00:21.660> move<00:00:21.840> the<00:00:22.050> tower<00:00:22.260> at

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
down when you need to move the tower at

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.349 
down when you need to move the tower at
the<00:00:22.710> end<00:00:22.980> of<00:00:23.039> the<00:00:23.130> growing<00:00:23.369> seasons<00:00:23.880> you<00:00:24.330> can

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
the end of the growing seasons you can

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:26.929 
the end of the growing seasons you can
let<00:00:24.600> it<00:00:24.720> dry<00:00:24.810> out<00:00:25.019> for<00:00:25.230> a<00:00:25.289> week<00:00:25.439> or<00:00:25.619> two<00:00:25.939> it

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
let it dry out for a week or two it

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:27.950 
let it dry out for a week or two it
doesn't<00:00:27.180> have<00:00:27.300> to<00:00:27.420> get<00:00:27.539> to<00:00:27.599> the<00:00:27.689> point<00:00:27.869> of

doesn't have to get to the point of
being<00:00:28.080> desiccated<00:00:28.769> but<00:00:29.340> it<00:00:29.490> will<00:00:29.580> lose<00:00:29.789> a<00:00:29.820> lot

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
being desiccated but it will lose a lot

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.330 
being desiccated but it will lose a lot
of<00:00:30.179> weight<00:00:30.420> if<00:00:30.689> your<00:00:31.170> media<00:00:31.769> is<00:00:31.920> nice<00:00:32.130> and

light a professional growers mix of some

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.119 
light a professional growers mix of some
kind<00:00:35.370> won't<00:00:36.149> have<00:00:36.360> clay<00:00:36.930> in<00:00:37.290> it<00:00:37.530> it<00:00:37.739> won't<00:00:37.890> have

kind won't have clay in it it won't have

any fillers in it and will generally be

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.130 
any fillers in it and will generally be
pretty<00:00:41.160> light<00:00:41.399> something<00:00:42.000> that<00:00:42.300> is<00:00:42.450> basically

pretty light something that is basically

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.110 
pretty light something that is basically
designed<00:00:43.379> for<00:00:43.920> hanging<00:00:44.370> baskets<00:00:44.940> or

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
designed for hanging baskets or

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.500 
designed for hanging baskets or
container<00:00:45.570> gardening<00:00:46.020> is<00:00:46.200> going<00:00:46.829> to<00:00:46.890> be<00:00:47.010> best

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:47.510 
container gardening is going to be best

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:51.080 
container gardening is going to be best
so<00:00:48.510> I'm<00:00:48.600> gonna<00:00:48.719> put<00:00:48.960> in<00:00:49.050> about<00:00:49.200> a<00:00:49.350> half<00:00:49.649> bag<00:00:50.090> or

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
so I'm gonna put in about a half bag or

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.990 
so I'm gonna put in about a half bag or
about<00:00:51.390> a<00:00:51.420> cubic<00:00:51.870> foot<00:00:52.079> and<00:00:52.260> a<00:00:52.289> half<00:00:52.469> perhaps

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:56.000 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.229 

and<00:00:57.000> then<00:00:57.570> because<00:00:58.410> we're<00:00:58.649> using<00:00:59.239> potting

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
and then because we're using potting

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.569 
and then because we're using potting
mixes<00:01:00.629> which<00:01:00.899> don't<00:01:01.649> have<00:01:01.890> amendments<00:01:02.280> in

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
mixes which don't have amendments in

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.000 
mixes which don't have amendments in
them<00:01:02.760> you<00:01:03.390> really<00:01:03.690> want<00:01:03.870> to<00:01:03.989> give<00:01:04.170> the<00:01:04.559> plants

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
them you really want to give the plants

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.160 
them you really want to give the plants
some<00:01:05.430> nutrients<00:01:06.000> to<00:01:06.180> get<00:01:06.299> things<00:01:06.570> going<00:01:07.049> and

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
some nutrients to get things going and

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.710 
some nutrients to get things going and
to<00:01:07.920> get<00:01:08.070> the<00:01:08.280> biology<00:01:08.790> and<00:01:08.820> ecology<00:01:09.119> of<00:01:09.630> the

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
to get the biology and ecology of the

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.410 
to get the biology and ecology of the
soil<00:01:09.990> active<00:01:10.880> so<00:01:12.470> here<00:01:13.470> I<00:01:13.500> have<00:01:13.710> a<00:01:13.740> mixture<00:01:14.159> of

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:14.420 
soil active so here I have a mixture of

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:17.539 
soil active so here I have a mixture of
vermiculite<00:01:15.860> with<00:01:16.860> a<00:01:16.890> lot<00:01:17.130> of<00:01:17.159> different

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
vermiculite with a lot of different

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:21.910 
vermiculite with a lot of different
composted<00:01:18.150> organics<00:01:19.729> there's<00:01:20.729> some<00:01:21.060> Alaskan

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:21.920 
composted organics there's some Alaskan

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:25.870 
composted organics there's some Alaskan
fish<00:01:22.920> fertilizer<00:01:23.400> in<00:01:24.000> here<00:01:24.330> in<00:01:24.479> pellet<00:01:25.020> form

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:25.880 
fish fertilizer in here in pellet form

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:29.060 
fish fertilizer in here in pellet form
so<00:01:26.880> basically<00:01:27.299> this<00:01:27.960> room<00:01:28.200> ikkyu<00:01:28.380> light<00:01:28.650> is

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
so basically this room ikkyu light is

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:30.319 
so basically this room ikkyu light is
just<00:01:29.310> going<00:01:29.430> to<00:01:29.490> make<00:01:29.670> this<00:01:29.850> soil<00:01:30.090> even

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
just going to make this soil even

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:34.069 
just going to make this soil even
lighter<00:01:31.579> and<00:01:32.579> vermiculite<00:01:33.060> is<00:01:33.360> great<00:01:33.630> because

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
lighter and vermiculite is great because

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.800 
lighter and vermiculite is great because
it<00:01:34.950> absorbs<00:01:35.159> many<00:01:35.880> times<00:01:36.180> its<00:01:36.420> own<00:01:36.540> weight<00:01:36.600> in

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
it absorbs many times its own weight in

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.890 
it absorbs many times its own weight in
water<00:01:37.369> so<00:01:38.369> it<00:01:38.939> helps<00:01:39.210> keep<00:01:39.390> your<00:01:39.540> plants

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
water so it helps keep your plants

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.770 
water so it helps keep your plants
hydrated<00:01:40.470> while<00:01:41.430> also<00:01:41.670> helping<00:01:42.210> to<00:01:42.240> lighten

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
hydrated while also helping to lighten

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.749 
hydrated while also helping to lighten
up<00:01:42.840> the<00:01:43.020> soil<00:01:43.200> and<00:01:43.439> increase<00:01:43.770> aeration<00:01:46.759> so

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
up the soil and increase aeration so

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:50.929 
up the soil and increase aeration so
every<00:01:48.270> row<00:01:48.600> of<00:01:48.630> soil<00:01:49.259> I<00:01:49.470> add<00:01:49.649> I'm<00:01:50.579> just<00:01:50.790> gonna

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
every row of soil I add I'm just gonna

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:56.480 
every row of soil I add I'm just gonna
add<00:01:51.090> some<00:01:51.329> amendment<00:01:54.020> really<00:01:55.040> the<00:01:56.040> innovation

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
add some amendment really the innovation

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:57.770 
add some amendment really the innovation
of<00:01:56.549> the<00:01:56.610> garden<00:01:56.880> tower<00:01:57.060> is<00:01:57.240> that<00:01:57.509> it<00:01:57.659> is

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
of the garden tower is that it is

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.660 
of the garden tower is that it is
composting<00:01:58.680> and<00:01:58.890> you<00:01:59.070> have<00:01:59.189> your<00:01:59.340> integrated

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
composting and you have your integrated

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.270 
composting and you have your integrated
composter<00:02:00.420> which<00:02:00.810> is<00:02:01.049> activated<00:02:01.649> with<00:02:02.009> worms

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
composter which is activated with worms

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.280 
composter which is activated with worms
and<00:02:02.700> that's<00:02:03.630> going<00:02:03.869> to<00:02:03.930> allow<00:02:04.079> you<00:02:04.140> to

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
and that's going to allow you to

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.080 
and that's going to allow you to
actually<00:02:04.710> make<00:02:04.860> more<00:02:05.130> nutrients<00:02:05.670> available

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
actually make more nutrients available

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.180 
actually make more nutrients available
in<00:02:06.149> the<00:02:06.240> system<00:02:06.450> and<00:02:06.869> actually<00:02:07.439> feed<00:02:07.680> it<00:02:07.829> to

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
in the system and actually feed it to

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.550
