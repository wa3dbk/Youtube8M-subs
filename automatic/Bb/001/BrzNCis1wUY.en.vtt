00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:17.250 
it's like if it's like they're saying
they<00:02:15.190> own<00:02:15.370> them<00:02:15.700> in<00:02:16.330> a<00:02:16.570> way<00:02:16.720> kind<00:02:16.990> of<00:02:17.080> I<00:02:17.230> don't

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:17.260 
they own them in a way kind of I don't

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:18.480 
they own them in a way kind of I don't
know<00:02:17.410> that's<00:02:17.680> what<00:02:17.830> it<00:02:17.920> kind<00:02:18.010> of<00:02:18.100> feels<00:02:18.250> like

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:18.490 
know that's what it kind of feels like

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:20.070
