00:02:48.939 --> 00:02:50.879 
area context like bat cave or like your
base<00:02:49.150> or<00:02:49.389> something<00:02:49.569> good<00:02:50.379> looks<00:02:50.650> pretty

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:50.889 
base or something good looks pretty

00:02:50.889 --> 00:02:52.679 
base or something good looks pretty
awesome<00:02:51.040> like<00:02:51.400> a<00:02:51.430> random<00:02:51.760> circular<00:02:52.209> area

00:02:52.679 --> 00:02:52.689
