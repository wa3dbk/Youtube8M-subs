just the same gay guy we've seen a

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.090 
just the same gay guy we've seen a
thousand<00:01:39.360> times<00:01:39.390> but<00:01:40.320> by<00:01:40.500> the<00:01:40.560> time<00:01:40.890> you've

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
thousand times but by the time you've

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.370 
thousand times but by the time you've
commented<00:01:41.640> on<00:01:42.000> it<00:01:42.180> enough<00:01:42.600> and<00:01:42.930> you<00:01:43.079> get<00:01:43.229> to

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
commented on it enough and you get to

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.499 
commented on it enough and you get to
the<00:01:43.470> end<00:01:43.680> and<00:01:43.920> there's<00:01:44.759> this<00:01:44.909> weird<00:01:45.119> twist

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
the end and there's this weird twist

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:48.770 
the end and there's this weird twist
people<00:01:45.899> go<00:01:46.020> oh<00:01:46.200> wait<00:01:46.619> wait<00:01:46.979> no<00:01:47.340> that's<00:01:47.780> that's

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
people go oh wait wait no that's that's

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:49.969 
people go oh wait wait no that's that's
not<00:01:48.960> what<00:01:49.020> I<00:01:49.140> thought<00:01:49.320> it<00:01:49.439> was<00:01:49.560> going<00:01:49.740> to<00:01:49.770> be

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
not what I thought it was going to be

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.010 
not what I thought it was going to be
and<00:01:50.610> I<00:01:51.000> think<00:01:51.090> that's<00:01:51.390> what<00:01:51.570> theater<00:01:51.840> should

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
and I think that's what theater should
