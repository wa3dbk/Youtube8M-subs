00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:05.640
 hello dear friends with you elena 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.740
 skulkina and project art lessons 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:10.710
 today I will tell you a few 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:12.330
 secrets of working with salt dough for 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:15.990
 children and adults 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:19.109
 in general, parents very rarely give salty 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:23.100
 dough for de creative activities of their 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:26.400
 children somehow they are more familiar plasticine 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:28.740
 but the dough in front of clay has a number 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.750
 the benefits are not so now 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.980
 little little thing you can do 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:36.870
 only small crafts yes it's flowers 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:39.870
 pretty limited look 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.250
 how much happiness how much can 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:45.360
 do all this 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:46.950
 you just can not imagine but actually 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:50.789
 so maybe not offer 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:52.680
 child about the difference clay and 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:55.770
 salt dough I will tell a little later 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:58.170
 now back to the test material though 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:00.780
 kind pleasant but he has a number 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.899
 nuances that need to be considered to 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.580
 the work was interesting 

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:08.880
 productive helpful and generally 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:12.210
 turned out in principle and so what on that 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:15.600
 need to pay attention first we 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:17.820
 Cooking dough recipe I already gave in 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.700
 one of the videos how can wires 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:23.159
 prepare the dough to mix color 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.979
 can be varied ie it is not 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:27.030
 Must be basic 

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:30.509
 yellow-green color for example you can 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.500
 add green color to yellow and you have when 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:34.890
 hanging 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:37.229
 and you will get more so warm 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.570
 shade or add blue to you 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:42.390
 get a dark green tint that's for 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:44.369
 about preparing dough now for that 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.049
 need to pay attention first you need 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:50.210
 make sure that the child is holding 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:53.000
 there were no wounds anywhere and the main ingredient 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:55.520
 dough this salt salt eats away wounds and 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.400
 the process of creativity can be spoiled 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:02.479
 second we will need to have a wet 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:05.900
 a cloth at hand salt in the process dries 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:08.149
 hands or can for example painted dough 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:10.700
 mess your hands so during the work we 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:13.459
 pens wipe and continue to work 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:17.360
 calm further well if you have on 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:19.040
 the table will be in the cardboard carton should 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:21.370
 be dense enough not much 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:26.900
 big what is it for 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:31.190
 look we make the finished product on 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:33.680
 carton it helps us to turn 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:36.140
 work from all sides and viewed 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:39.830
 somewhere something is missing somewhere something 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:43.000
 need to add so the child has 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:45.739
 opportunity to consider work on 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.590
 the completion of how the work dries and its 

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:51.470
 You can remove from the carton and finished work 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:54.470
 there is already so beautiful 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:58.160
 smart now in the course of work 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:03:00.860
 the first thing we do is from chip it to them 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:04.030
 piece of dough and solid piece 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:07.010
 the edge of such a piece has an uneven edge 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:09.709
 such a piece has an uneven surface 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:12.160
 so always before you do 

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:15.920
 some new detail we dough 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:20.720
 kneading I explain to the kids what you need 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:23.660
 warm the dough with him to make friends 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:25.280
 she became soft and elastic we 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:28.720
 knead the dough until 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:32.209
 the surface will not become smooth and now 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:35.840
 this dough is ready to go 

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:38.630
 roll the sausage or ball that you 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:43.880
 it is necessary on an idea this ball we 

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:44.690
 send to carton where we can 

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:46.910
 turn 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:53.920
 now we will need to attach another 

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:53.920
 Particle again pinch warm up 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:04:00.500
 and before you attach this detail 

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:04.160
 our previous item we need 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:07.160
 moisten wet much we do not need only 

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:11.030
 slightly dunk finger and wet 

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:13.340
 surface and after that we can 

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:16.329
 attach the next thing in this 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:19.449
 In our case , water serves as glue. 

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:22.940
 almost the fact is that during the work 

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:25.300
 the dough dries and crust 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:28.760
 then the parts stop sticking to each other 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:30.400
 such a reception and all your parts will be 

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:34.400
 glued together 

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:35.300
 well, that's all for now 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:38.740
 creativity 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:38.740
 all the best and see you
