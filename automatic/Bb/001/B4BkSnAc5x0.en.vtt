00:00:03.589 --> 00:00:10.290
 hi i'm francesco cola and i want to 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:12.960
 present you a tutorial on how to make a 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:15.600
 lens favor or even an idea 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:18.119
 gift but always contending for a 

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:20.220
 natural element of mind in his 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:22.769
 general composition 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:25.289
 today I want to introduce you for example how 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:27.659
 you make a captain to the Japanese that is 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:30.329
 a land of moss in which instead of 

00:00:27.659 --> 00:00:31.199
 see a map inside a 

00:00:30.329 --> 00:00:34.560
 jar 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:37.170
 let's say how you normally use video yes 

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:39.360
 commonly found on the other hand 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.400
 we're going to recreate a pearl of moss 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.770
 inside which we will see a map 

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:45.930
 fantastic to add then maybe a 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.730
 ceramic component an element 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.830
 ceramic accessory to create 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.990
 just a fantastic gift idea from or 

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:53.760
 even a wedding favor you live for 

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:55.560
 memo events such as weddings 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.400
 communions and how well we come to 

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:58.110
 therefore 

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:00.540
 let's get to the point at the pil is what there 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:02.220
 it is necessary to specify this blows 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:04.970
 Japanese weapon for moss 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:06.920
 then on ours 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:09.470
 on the right we practically have 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:11.960
 need to happen that is a soil 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:14.540
 particular that however everything is found 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:16.970
 what you will notice here will be found anyway 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:19.070
 in the market it is very easily in the 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:21.710
 garden or card shops and in the shops of 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:23.770
 flowers then happen but what a loam 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:26.690
 and very particular of metric grain 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:31.070
 variable and what years will be needed instead 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:32.780
 then go and maybe make it more fine 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:35.600
 maybe with a small hammer 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:39.470
 having said that we need then still 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:42.229
 universal pumice soil that 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:44.869
 will be very useful as a supplement and 

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:47.750
 of the moss note that it is of 

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:50.360
 natural moss alive as you can 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:52.310
 maybe collect nature or whatever 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:53.630
 or even moss or 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:55.729
 buy at the date does not have 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:58.009
 straight dehydrated moss type 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:02:01.190
 artificial clearly of the seedlings 

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:02.930
 learn genre may be ideal for 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:08.209
 who is also of the spathiphyllum genus 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:10.100
 tastes or even not just hear and then one 

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:12.769
 time we need cotton or 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:14.870
 as an alternative to the scissors string e 

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:17.690
 now we will take a pan of 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:19.790
 plastic where we are going to put I already have 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:21.110
 prepared a bit of the muscle I have 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:23.810
 talked about before 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:28.250
 we will hydrate it and make it rest 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:31.340
 for a few moments after that 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:33.260
 we will take another tray where 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:37.549
 we are going to position in this case that 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:37.940
 a soil the soil of which I spoke 

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:41.390
 before 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:43.970
 the soil we say universal and I say 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:50.030
 yes because he calls it paul inside 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:55.430
 of fraschetta 10 spoken of soil 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:58.430
 a part of pumice all things that you 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:02.000
 can find some acatama 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:04.600
 granular after which we go to do 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.600
 the dough 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:16.110
 it is preferable to put less and less water 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:19.080
 in the beginning in such a way that one must 

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:22.200
 choose the right density well now 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:24.180
 with this mixture we will go as we have 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:26.730
 precisely prepared deliberately we go to 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:30.090
 create a ball is fine a ball 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:31.830
 of this soil of this mixture 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:35.340
 that we're going to steer to get out 

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:37.950
 excess water made this way 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:41.790
 ok maybe we will position the 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:45.180
 prepared on our work plan 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:47.340
 then here is something not to dirty 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:49.650
 then we take one now 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:51.180
 of the plants in this case I go to 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:52.680
 take for example a spathiphyllum 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:56.790
 that we raise from his vessel 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:59.790
 ok we manipulate but it is with the scissors we give 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:02.310
 always a little a little let's say 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:05.930
 trimmed to the tips of the roots for 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:10.889
 allow precisely to invigorate even though 

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:15.810
 indicators well now let's say 

00:04:10.889 --> 00:04:20.840
 small ball of soil we are going to open e 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:26.520
 place the just inside 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:29.550
 seedling we'll break by doing 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:31.530
 get out of excess water well if it does 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:39.479
 we will still use earth we add 

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:43.710
 without problems it is fine and we try to 

00:04:39.479 --> 00:04:45.800
 make a spherical shape by compacting the 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:48.810
 all by letting excess water out 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:54.780
 the agreement after which we will take the 

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:56.610
 moss we squeeze it we see the moss 

00:04:54.780 --> 00:05:03.470
 that we are going to position it 

00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:03.470
 wide around the ball 

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:17.440
 once we have covered that 

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:20.560
 earth will not be seen anymore we always go to 

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:22.800
 squeeze further if it is too much 

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:22.800
 water 

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:29.500
 also in the lower part we go to 

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:32.110
 roll out this this moss of 

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:34.600
 coating that will be fundamental then 

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:37.030
 to subsequently hydrate the whole does 

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:43.000
 they always give a form with their hands 

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:46.960
 spherical to everything and we're almost there 

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:51.370
 well create a spherical shape at the 

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:52.870
 seedling we will take cotton a cotton 

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:55.870
 natural 

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:56.800
 maybe dark brown and green 

00:05:55.870 --> 00:06:02.860
 whatever 

00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:05.530
 let's go for lots of fast laps without it 

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:12.030
 no problem at all 

00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:19.080
 directions so as to block the moss 

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:22.080
 on the soil made this compacted again 

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:22.080
 further 

00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:31.300
 with a stick maybe they help you 

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:34.750
 give a form to insert better 

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:36.460
 inside the map 

00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:43.950
 that's for those who want to be a lot 

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:47.430
 precise a little further squeeze 

00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:47.430
 we 're almost there 

00:06:50.529 --> 00:06:52.949
 and then 

00:06:55.529 --> 00:07:02.579
 Andrea has positioned this land of 

00:06:58.859 --> 00:07:05.159
 moss on a ceramic saucer a 

00:07:02.579 --> 00:07:07.439
 accessory element to be able to recreate 

00:07:05.159 --> 00:07:09.389
 just normally we now thread 

00:07:07.439 --> 00:07:12.119
 we will position in the middle instead 

00:07:09.389 --> 00:07:14.129
 in art I do n't know East Asian feng 

00:07:12.119 --> 00:07:16.049
 shui is positioned laterally to 

00:07:14.129 --> 00:07:18.269
 give this kind of triangle 

00:07:16.049 --> 00:07:23.249
 and here is a magnificent and the gift 

00:07:18.269 --> 00:07:27.139
 i believe nature or living way like 

00:07:23.249 --> 00:07:27.139
 precisely this few Japanese lady
