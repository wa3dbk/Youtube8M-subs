now is you want to obviously mark all
the<00:02:36.510> beats<00:02:36.840> so<00:02:37.590> you<00:02:37.829> can<00:02:38.010> do<00:02:38.129> this<00:02:38.250> precisely

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
the beats so you can do this precisely

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:41.479 
the beats so you can do this precisely
by<00:02:39.030> just<00:02:39.359> listening<00:02:39.569> it<00:02:40.079> and<00:02:40.290> just<00:02:40.489> looking

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:41.489 
by just listening it and just looking

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:42.770 
by just listening it and just looking
down<00:02:41.670> here<00:02:41.939> and<00:02:41.970> just<00:02:42.180> trying<00:02:42.359> to<00:02:42.450> figure<00:02:42.599> it

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
down here and just trying to figure it

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:45.649 
down here and just trying to figure it
out<00:02:42.930> when<00:02:43.640> the<00:02:44.640> beat<00:02:44.790> is<00:02:45.000> of<00:02:45.269> course<00:02:45.420> that's

00:02:45.649 --> 00:02:45.659 
out when the beat is of course that's

00:02:45.659 --> 00:02:47.420 
out when the beat is of course that's
what<00:02:45.840> I<00:02:45.900> strongly<00:02:46.379> suggest<00:02:46.590> and<00:02:46.950> that<00:02:47.099> is<00:02:47.220> what

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430
