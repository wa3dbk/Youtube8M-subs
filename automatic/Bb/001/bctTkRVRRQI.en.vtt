gonna<00:01:28.530> get<00:01:28.800> from<00:01:29.429> a<00:01:29.909> beer<00:01:30.570> from<00:01:31.140> the<00:01:31.289> tank<00:01:31.500> and

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:31.830 
gonna get from a beer from the tank and

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:35.149 
gonna get from a beer from the tank and
then<00:01:32.670> they<00:01:32.940> they<00:01:33.479> put<00:01:33.750> air<00:01:34.080> on<00:01:35.009> the<00:01:35.100> outside

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
then they they put air on the outside

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:44.779 
then they they put air on the outside
right<00:01:40.759> so<00:01:41.759> the<00:01:42.330> air<00:01:42.539> pushes<00:01:43.460> around<00:01:44.460> the

00:01:44.779 --> 00:01:44.789 
right so the air pushes around the

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:46.760 
right so the air pushes around the
polypropylene<00:01:45.450> bag<00:01:45.899> to<00:01:46.110> create<00:01:46.440> enough

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
polypropylene bag to create enough

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.190

pressure<00:01:46.979> for<00:01:47.610> the<00:01:47.759> beer<00:01:48.300> to<00:01:48.509> go<00:01:48.630> up<00:01:48.750> to<00:01:49.050> the

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
pressure for the beer to go up to the

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.339 
pressure for the beer to go up to the
bar<00:01:49.950> and<00:01:50.429> the<00:01:50.849> fact<00:01:51.060> that<00:01:51.209> it<00:01:51.300> has<00:01:51.420> no<00:01:51.599> co2<00:01:51.869> in

00:01:52.339 --> 00:01:52.349

00:01:52.349 --> 00:01:55.279 
bar and the fact that it has no co2 in
it<00:01:52.470> means<00:01:53.039> that<00:01:53.399> there's<00:01:53.970> nothing<00:01:54.450> to<00:01:54.869> disturb

00:01:55.279 --> 00:01:55.289 
it means that there's nothing to disturb

00:01:55.289 --> 00:01:58.370 
it means that there's nothing to disturb
the<00:01:55.560> actual<00:01:55.950> flavor<00:01:56.250> of<00:01:56.509> the<00:01:57.509> beer<00:01:57.720> so<00:01:58.349> you

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
the actual flavor of the beer so you

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.719
