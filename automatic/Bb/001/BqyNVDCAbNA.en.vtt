00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:11.880
 damn they do not take us that seriously 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.650
 That's right 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.950
 this region is even spoiled 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:19.380
 But when I thought that was the reason 

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:21.090
 why I even chose her as 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.800
 Cadet you get everything to the head 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:26.220
 thrown a pity that I do not 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:28.289
 have known earlier abschauen 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:31.560
 This damned can only look on 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:33.809
 Weak ones think themselves 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.580
 Do you talk then because you decided 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:38.239
 that you are going to military police 

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:38.239
 no piece better 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:42.589
 i 'm better i 'm not a failure like that 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.430
 their 

00:00:42.589 --> 00:00:47.809
 I came here for the 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.809
 change military police 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:53.580
 I'm impressed Mario I knew 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.870
 not that our new hero is and how 

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:58.710
 do you want to do that 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:00.600
 I will work my way up when I do that 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.920
 I'll make sure that 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.559
 it's a harder workout and a 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:07.650
 there will be better training for everyone 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:11.789
 It's easy. I'll take care of that 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:14.689
 that we will be the elite with 

00:01:11.789 --> 00:01:14.689
 human gear 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:33.600
 I think it would be the end for us 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:37.170
 mean if a good person the 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.740
 obtained control then what should you have 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.670
 you a 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:46.170
 I think that you are right because the 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:47.189
 things that you say are what I know 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.340
 someone like You 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:51.289
 It takes great courage against the current too 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:56.640
 swim 

00:01:51.289 --> 00:02:00.179
 I respect that too if you only have one 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:02.609
 idiot maybe that one 

00:02:00.179 --> 00:02:04.999
 also just the idiot but i am 

00:02:02.609 --> 00:02:04.999
 not anymore 

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:17.140
 I just want the weak ones 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:22.050
 let yourself be carried away by the current as 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:22.050
 also be considered as human
