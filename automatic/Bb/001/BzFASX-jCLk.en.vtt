00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:07.710 
okay guys I built a Wi-Fi jammer another

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:10.520 
okay guys I built a Wi-Fi jammer another
one<00:00:07.919> of<00:00:08.069> my<00:00:08.309> little<00:00:08.910> evil<00:00:09.780> mad<00:00:09.990> scientist

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.530 
one of my little evil mad scientist

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:15.379 
one of my little evil mad scientist
projects<00:00:11.660> and<00:00:13.190> right<00:00:14.190> now<00:00:14.340> I'm<00:00:14.610> testing<00:00:15.269> it<00:00:15.330> to

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
projects and right now I'm testing it to

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:16.910 
projects and right now I'm testing it to
see<00:00:15.480> how<00:00:15.660> long<00:00:15.719> it'll<00:00:16.020> run<00:00:16.199> on<00:00:16.230> this<00:00:16.470> heat<00:00:16.650> sink

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
see how long it'll run on this heat sink

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.310 
see how long it'll run on this heat sink
for<00:00:17.250> it<00:00:17.369> starts<00:00:18.330> burning<00:00:18.510> my<00:00:18.779> hands<00:00:19.050> and<00:00:19.260> I

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
for it starts burning my hands and I

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.370 
for it starts burning my hands and I
have<00:00:19.439> to<00:00:19.650> get<00:00:20.490> a<00:00:20.520> bigger<00:00:20.760> one<00:00:21.060> for<00:00:21.090> it<00:00:21.390> let's

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
have to get a bigger one for it let's

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.730 
have to get a bigger one for it let's
see<00:00:22.590> if<00:00:23.250> I<00:00:23.580> need<00:00:24.090> a<00:00:24.119> bigger<00:00:24.359> one<00:00:24.539> or<00:00:24.689> not<00:00:24.779> right

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
see if I need a bigger one or not right

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.599 
see if I need a bigger one or not right
now<00:00:25.890> it's<00:00:26.039> two<00:00:26.070> pretty<00:00:26.460> good<00:00:27.170> it's<00:00:28.170> a<00:00:28.609> little

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
now it's two pretty good it's a little

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.110 
now it's two pretty good it's a little
warm<00:00:30.140> yeah<00:00:31.140> but<00:00:31.769> it's<00:00:31.859> writing<00:00:32.070> in<00:00:32.219> 350

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
warm yeah but it's writing in 350

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.790 
warm yeah but it's writing in 350
milliamps<00:00:34.280> it's<00:00:35.280> got<00:00:35.550> to<00:00:35.670> run<00:00:35.880> all<00:00:36.770> four<00:00:37.770> of

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
milliamps it's got to run all four of

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.400 
milliamps it's got to run all four of
these<00:00:38.100> and<00:00:39.500> these<00:00:40.500> are<00:00:40.920> 2.4<00:00:41.730> gigahertz

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:42.410 
these and these are 2.4 gigahertz

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:47.540 
these and these are 2.4 gigahertz
transmitters<00:00:43.969> they<00:00:44.969> each<00:00:45.329> have<00:00:46.370> see<00:00:47.370> if<00:00:47.430> it'll

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
transmitters they each have see if it'll

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.090 
transmitters they each have see if it'll
focus<00:00:47.840> probably<00:00:48.840> won't<00:00:48.989> my<00:00:49.680> camera<00:00:49.980> doesn't

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
focus probably won't my camera doesn't

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.180 
focus probably won't my camera doesn't
focus<00:00:50.399> on<00:00:50.670> anything<00:00:50.850> sorry<00:00:51.210> I<00:00:51.239> guess<00:00:51.890> but<00:00:52.890> each

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
focus on anything sorry I guess but each

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.840 
focus on anything sorry I guess but each
of<00:00:53.399> them<00:00:53.550> have<00:00:54.000> a<00:00:54.510> channel<00:00:55.410> which<00:00:55.890> one<00:00:56.670> two

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
of them have a channel which one two

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.770 
of them have a channel which one two
three<00:00:57.090> or<00:00:57.180> four<00:00:57.210> and<00:00:59.149> they<00:01:00.149> are<00:01:00.359> all<00:01:00.510> in<00:01:00.690> the

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
three or four and they are all in the

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.420 
three or four and they are all in the
2.4<00:01:01.320> gigahertz<00:01:01.379> spectrum<00:01:02.629> so<00:01:03.629> each<00:01:04.619> channel

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
2.4 gigahertz spectrum so each channel

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.500 
2.4 gigahertz spectrum so each channel
on<00:01:05.610> this<00:01:05.939> will<00:01:06.510> cover<00:01:07.159> you<00:01:08.159> know<00:01:08.280> two<00:01:09.150> or<00:01:09.180> three

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
on this will cover you know two or three

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.510 
on this will cover you know two or three
channels<00:01:09.869> or<00:01:10.260> whatever<00:01:10.979> it<00:01:11.130> is<00:01:11.189> on<00:01:11.460> the<00:01:11.700> main

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:13.520 
channels or whatever it is on the main

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:18.200 
channels or whatever it is on the main
Wi-Fi<00:01:15.020> spectrum<00:01:16.020> so<00:01:16.229> it<00:01:16.350> covers<00:01:17.150> more<00:01:18.150> than

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
Wi-Fi spectrum so it covers more than

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.530 
Wi-Fi spectrum so it covers more than
Wi-Fi<00:01:18.990> covers<00:01:19.650> in<00:01:20.030> fact<00:01:21.030> it<00:01:21.240> covers

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
Wi-Fi covers in fact it covers

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.350 
Wi-Fi covers in fact it covers
everything<00:01:22.340> so<00:01:23.340> as<00:01:23.520> you<00:01:23.670> can<00:01:23.790> see<00:01:24.000> right<00:01:24.030> now

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
everything so as you can see right now

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.850 
everything so as you can see right now
it's<00:01:25.020> on<00:01:25.470> and<00:01:26.479> you<00:01:27.479> have<00:01:27.659> no<00:01:28.049> network<00:01:28.380> let's

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
it's on and you have no network let's

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:36.620 
it's on and you have no network let's
deliver<00:01:29.630> nothing<00:01:33.439> and<00:01:34.439> just<00:01:34.470> make<00:01:35.070> sure<00:01:35.630> you

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
deliver nothing and just make sure you

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:44.990 
deliver nothing and just make sure you
can't<00:01:36.900> connect<00:01:38.570> nothing<00:01:39.570> works<00:01:40.460> so<00:01:43.850> seems<00:01:44.850> to

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
can't connect nothing works so seems to

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.990 
can't connect nothing works so seems to
be<00:01:45.090> doing<00:01:45.240> alright<00:01:45.590> so<00:01:46.590> we'll<00:01:46.710> take<00:01:46.950> the<00:01:47.610> power

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
be doing alright so we'll take the power

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.600 
be doing alright so we'll take the power
connector<00:01:48.570> off<00:01:50.570> and<00:01:51.979> there<00:01:52.979> you<00:01:53.070> go<00:01:53.130> now<00:01:53.549> the

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
connector off and there you go now the

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.490 
connector off and there you go now the
jammers<00:01:54.030> just<00:01:54.210> floating<00:01:54.930> no<00:01:55.290> power

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
jammers just floating no power

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.310 
jammers just floating no power
whatsoever<00:01:56.630> I'm<00:01:57.630> just<00:01:57.810> going<00:01:57.960> to<00:01:57.990> sit<00:01:58.170> there

Wi-Fi still no Wi-Fi it'll take them in
a<00:02:09.239> court<00:02:09.539> to<00:02:10.430> reset

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
a court to reset

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.750 
a court to reset
but<00:02:13.360> we'll<00:02:13.510> give<00:02:13.660> it<00:02:13.690> another<00:02:13.810> try<00:02:14.580> it's<00:02:15.580> not

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 
but we'll give it another try it's not

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:19.560 
but we'll give it another try it's not
so<00:02:16.690> will<00:02:16.960> refresh<00:02:17.380> the<00:02:17.590> Wi-Fi<00:02:17.920> now<00:02:18.390> as<00:02:19.390> you<00:02:19.480> can

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:19.570 
so will refresh the Wi-Fi now as you can

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:25.590 
so will refresh the Wi-Fi now as you can
see<00:02:19.660> bit<00:02:20.140> pops<00:02:20.560> right<00:02:20.770> up<00:02:23.730> and<00:02:24.730> give<00:02:25.450> it<00:02:25.480> a

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:25.600 
see bit pops right up and give it a

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:29.730 
see bit pops right up and give it a
second<00:02:26.020> what<00:02:26.260> connects<00:02:27.480> if<00:02:28.480> it<00:02:28.930> connects<00:02:29.230> ok

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:29.740 
second what connects if it connects ok

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:32.100 
second what connects if it connects ok
it's<00:02:29.860> connected<00:02:30.450> with<00:02:31.450> limited<00:02:31.660> access

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:32.110 
it's connected with limited access

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:38.180 
it's connected with limited access
apparently<00:02:33.540> so<00:02:34.540> it<00:02:34.630> works<00:02:35.580> they're<00:02:36.580> such<00:02:36.900> and

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
apparently so it works they're such and

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:42.720 
apparently so it works they're such and
we'll<00:02:39.300> kick<00:02:40.300> it<00:02:40.330> back<00:02:40.600> up<00:02:41.490> right<00:02:42.490> now<00:02:42.610> I've

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:42.730 
we'll kick it back up right now I've

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:45.060 
we'll kick it back up right now I've
just<00:02:42.760> got<00:02:42.970> you<00:02:43.330> know<00:02:43.390> 12<00:02:43.960> volts<00:02:44.380> going<00:02:44.560> into<00:02:44.950> it

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:45.070 
just got you know 12 volts going into it

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:47.210 
just got you know 12 volts going into it
i'm<00:02:45.160> going<00:02:45.280> to<00:02:45.370> write<00:02:45.490> on<00:02:45.670> nine<00:02:45.940> so<00:02:46.300> it'll<00:02:46.540> be

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
i'm going to write on nine so it'll be
