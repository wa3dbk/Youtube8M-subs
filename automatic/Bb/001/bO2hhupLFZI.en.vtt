00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
soon we start to realize that by doing

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:00.319 
soon we start to realize that by doing

less robust computing but many times
over<00:01:00.660> we<00:01:01.230> could<00:01:01.379> do<00:01:01.500> better<00:01:01.739> things<00:01:02.070> this<00:01:02.670> is

over we could do better things this is

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:06.260 
over we could do better things this is
that<00:01:03.030> same<00:01:03.329> demonstration<00:01:03.769> for<00:01:04.769> GPU<00:01:05.280> with

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
that same demonstration for GPU with

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.660 
that same demonstration for GPU with
thousands<00:01:07.049> of<00:01:07.290> paintballs<00:01:07.799> painting<00:01:08.520> the

thousands of paintballs painting the
Mona<00:01:08.820> Lisa<00:01:09.200> so<00:01:10.200> small<00:01:10.799> programs<00:01:11.340> but

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
Mona Lisa so small programs but

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.390 
Mona Lisa so small programs but
thousands<00:01:12.630> of<00:01:12.780> course<00:01:13.110> and<00:01:13.830> I<00:01:13.950> was<00:01:14.040> trying<00:01:14.250> to

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
thousands of course and I was trying to

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.010 
thousands of course and I was trying to
take<00:01:14.549> this<00:01:14.700> metaphor<00:01:15.060> a<00:01:15.270> little<00:01:15.630> bit<00:01:15.750> more

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
take this metaphor a little bit more

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.320 
take this metaphor a little bit more
because<00:01:16.500> if<00:01:16.770> you<00:01:16.890> had<00:01:17.040> one<00:01:17.340> core<00:01:17.640> at<00:01:17.729> the<00:01:17.850> CPU

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
because if you had one core at the CPU

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.320 
because if you had one core at the CPU
and<00:01:18.560> thousands<00:01:19.560> of<00:01:19.619> cores<00:01:19.890> of<00:01:20.040> the<00:01:20.100> GPU<00:01:20.610> how<00:01:21.270> do

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
and thousands of cores of the GPU how do

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.210 
and thousands of cores of the GPU how do
I<00:01:21.450> handle<00:01:21.990> a<00:01:22.170> trillion<00:01:23.159> trillion<00:01:24.080> trillion

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:25.220 
I handle a trillion trillion trillion

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:27.200 
I handle a trillion trillion trillion
trillion<00:01:26.220> cores

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
trillion cores

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.200 
trillion cores
I<00:01:28.130> think<00:01:29.130> you<00:01:29.250> have<00:01:29.400> to<00:01:29.579> look<00:01:29.700> at<00:01:29.880> something

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
I think you have to look at something

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.260 
I think you have to look at something
like<00:01:30.329> this<00:01:30.950> quantum<00:01:31.950> computing<00:01:32.369> is<00:01:32.790> a<00:01:32.850> whole

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
like this quantum computing is a whole

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.920 
like this quantum computing is a whole
new<00:01:33.509> world<00:01:33.840> of<00:01:34.110> very<00:01:35.009> small<00:01:35.369> programs

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:35.930 
new world of very small programs

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:39.380 
new world of very small programs
happening<00:01:36.930> at<00:01:37.140> a<00:01:37.200> whole<00:01:37.860> bunch<00:01:37.890> of<00:01:38.549> times<00:01:39.000> to

happening at a whole bunch of times to

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.319 
happening at a whole bunch of times to
get<00:01:39.659> a<00:01:39.840> single<00:01:40.110> result<00:01:41.030> I'm<00:01:42.030> going<00:01:42.090> to<00:01:42.240> take

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
get a single result I'm going to take

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:43.670 
get a single result I'm going to take
you<00:01:42.450> through<00:01:42.630> a<00:01:42.659> small<00:01:42.899> demonstration<00:01:43.140> of

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
you through a small demonstration of

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.240 
you through a small demonstration of
prime<00:01:44.040> factors<00:01:44.610> and<00:01:44.909> the<00:01:45.689> idea<00:01:45.960> here<00:01:46.259> is<00:01:46.530> what

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
prime factors and the idea here is what

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.100 
prime factors and the idea here is what
is<00:01:47.369> the<00:01:47.520> prime<00:01:47.759> factor<00:01:48.210> of<00:01:48.390> a<00:01:48.540> very<00:01:48.780> large

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
is the prime factor of a very large

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.319 
is the prime factor of a very large
number<00:01:49.560> and<00:01:50.009> this<00:01:50.159> is<00:01:50.310> a<00:01:50.340> very<00:01:50.610> hard<00:01:50.909> thing<00:01:50.970> for

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
number and this is a very hard thing for

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:54.200 
number and this is a very hard thing for
a<00:01:51.689> CPU<00:01:52.380> to<00:01:52.619> do<00:01:52.770> it's<00:01:52.979> going<00:01:53.130> to<00:01:53.189> take<00:01:53.340> tons<00:01:53.909> and

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
a CPU to do it's going to take tons and

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.289 
a CPU to do it's going to take tons and
tons<00:01:54.240> of<00:01:54.540> time<00:01:54.720> but<00:01:55.590> a<00:01:55.829> much<00:01:56.460> easier<00:01:56.640> question

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
tons of time but a much easier question

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:01.399 
tons of time but a much easier question
is<00:01:58.229> to<00:01:58.500> say<00:01:58.710> do<00:01:59.460> two<00:01:59.850> numbers<00:02:00.409> multiplied

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
is to say do two numbers multiplied

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:04.550 
is to say do two numbers multiplied
together<00:02:01.469> equal<00:02:02.070> this<00:02:02.640> number<00:02:03.060> and<00:02:03.270> if<00:02:04.229> you<00:02:04.350> do

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
together equal this number and if you do

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.389 
together equal this number and if you do
that<00:02:04.829> for<00:02:05.340> all<00:02:05.549> combinations<00:02:06.299> of<00:02:07.020> numbers<00:02:07.399> you

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
that for all combinations of numbers you

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.130 
that for all combinations of numbers you
will<00:02:08.550> eventually<00:02:08.789> find<00:02:09.179> what<00:02:09.750> the<00:02:09.899> prime

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
will eventually find what the prime

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.589 
will eventually find what the prime
factors<00:02:10.649> are<00:02:11.030> so<00:02:12.030> let's<00:02:12.330> see<00:02:12.450> that

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
factors are so let's see that

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:13.760 
factors are so let's see that
demonstration<00:02:13.200> but<00:02:13.319> let's<00:02:13.530> do<00:02:13.620> it

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
demonstration but let's do it

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.110 
demonstration but let's do it
a smaller<00:02:14.250> number<00:02:14.640> that<00:02:14.670> we<00:02:14.850> can<00:02:14.970> actually

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
a smaller number that we can actually

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.180 
a smaller number that we can actually
keep<00:02:15.450> in<00:02:15.600> our<00:02:15.690> head<00:02:15.870> so<00:02:16.800> we're<00:02:16.920> gonna<00:02:17.010> look<00:02:17.130> for

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
keep in our head so we're gonna look for

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:19.940 
keep in our head so we're gonna look for
the<00:02:17.340> prime<00:02:17.670> factors<00:02:18.210> of<00:02:18.390> 35<00:02:19.230> which<00:02:19.770> of<00:02:19.920> course

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
the prime factors of 35 which of course

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:23.630 
the prime factors of 35 which of course
are<00:02:20.370> five<00:02:20.970> and<00:02:21.180> seven<00:02:21.650> we<00:02:22.650> start<00:02:22.920> out<00:02:23.100> we<00:02:23.520> have

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
are five and seven we start out we have

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.420 
are five and seven we start out we have
six<00:02:24.000> cubits<00:02:24.540> here<00:02:24.870> the<00:02:25.740> first<00:02:25.980> three<00:02:26.250> are

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
six cubits here the first three are

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.160 
six cubits here the first three are
gonna<00:02:26.610> be<00:02:26.820> represent<00:02:27.390> our<00:02:27.480> first<00:02:27.720> number<00:02:28.050> and

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
gonna be represent our first number and

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:30.230 
gonna be represent our first number and
the<00:02:28.260> second<00:02:29.100> three<00:02:29.250> are<00:02:29.430> gonna<00:02:29.610> represent<00:02:29.940> our

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:30.240 
the second three are gonna represent our

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:33.140 
the second three are gonna represent our
second<00:02:30.660> number<00:02:30.780> and<00:02:31.410> when<00:02:31.620> we<00:02:31.740> are<00:02:31.860> done<00:02:32.150> we're

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
second number and when we are done we're

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:36.140 
second number and when we are done we're
gonna<00:02:33.300> end<00:02:33.540> up<00:02:33.750> with<00:02:33.990> the<00:02:34.890> first<00:02:35.280> one<00:02:35.550> being

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
gonna end up with the first one being

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.060 
gonna end up with the first one being
one<00:02:36.600> zero<00:02:36.930> one<00:02:37.200> although<00:02:37.560> in<00:02:37.740> quantum

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:38.070 
one zero one although in quantum

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:39.800 
one zero one although in quantum
computing<00:02:38.190> we<00:02:38.580> actually<00:02:38.850> think<00:02:39.030> of<00:02:39.120> it<00:02:39.270> as<00:02:39.420> one

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
computing we actually think of it as one

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:43.160 
computing we actually think of it as one
negative<00:02:40.560> one<00:02:40.800> one<00:02:41.370> and<00:02:41.670> the<00:02:42.330> second<00:02:43.050> one

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
negative one one and the second one

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:46.790 
negative one one and the second one
being<00:02:43.200> all<00:02:43.740> want<00:02:44.220> and<00:02:45.050> this<00:02:46.050> is<00:02:46.110> a<00:02:46.260> useful<00:02:46.500> way

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:46.800 
being all want and this is a useful way

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:48.890 
being all want and this is a useful way
for<00:02:46.830> me<00:02:47.160> to<00:02:47.190> think<00:02:47.520> of<00:02:47.640> it<00:02:47.760> as<00:02:47.940> a<00:02:48.330> programmer

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
for me to think of it as a programmer

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:52.700 
for me to think of it as a programmer
but<00:02:49.970> it's<00:02:50.970> not<00:02:51.300> actually<00:02:52.050> a<00:02:52.170> good<00:02:52.500> way<00:02:52.650> to

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:52.710 
but it's not actually a good way to

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:55.100 
but it's not actually a good way to
think<00:02:53.070> of<00:02:53.190> it<00:02:53.310> and<00:02:53.520> the<00:02:53.640> quantum<00:02:54.030> mechanics<00:02:54.600> so

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.110 
think of it and the quantum mechanics so

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:56.690 
think of it and the quantum mechanics so
let's<00:02:55.230> sort<00:02:55.350> of<00:02:55.470> expand<00:02:55.980> this<00:02:56.100> out<00:02:56.310> to<00:02:56.550> what

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
let's sort of expand this out to what

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:58.610 
let's sort of expand this out to what
the<00:02:56.850> full<00:02:57.120> story<00:02:57.510> is<00:02:57.630> going<00:02:57.780> to<00:02:57.870> be<00:02:58.050> what<00:02:58.530> we

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
the full story is going to be what we

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:01.340 
the full story is going to be what we
have<00:02:58.740> here<00:02:59.220> is<00:02:59.360> every<00:03:00.360> possible<00:03:01.020> combination

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:01.350 
have here is every possible combination

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:04.190 
have here is every possible combination
of<00:03:01.980> the<00:03:02.190> six<00:03:02.490> bits<00:03:02.730> and<00:03:03.060> you'll<00:03:03.810> see<00:03:03.960> that<00:03:04.080> the

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
of the six bits and you'll see that the

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:07.040 
of the six bits and you'll see that the
energy<00:03:04.470> probability<00:03:05.280> of<00:03:05.490> any<00:03:06.120> of<00:03:06.480> the<00:03:06.870> other

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:07.050 
energy probability of any of the other

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:09.770 
energy probability of any of the other
states<00:03:07.500> has<00:03:08.130> been<00:03:08.370> massively<00:03:09.060> reduced<00:03:09.540> to

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 
states has been massively reduced to

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:13.460 
states has been massively reduced to
zero<00:03:10.580> but<00:03:11.580> we<00:03:11.910> still<00:03:12.150> have<00:03:12.360> two<00:03:12.780> highly

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470 
zero but we still have two highly

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:17.420 
zero but we still have two highly
probable<00:03:14.330> situations<00:03:15.330> over<00:03:15.570> here<00:03:16.020> and<00:03:16.430> over

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 
probable situations over here and over

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:19.670 
probable situations over here and over
here<00:03:17.460> so<00:03:18.270> this<00:03:18.450> one<00:03:18.660> is<00:03:18.870> going<00:03:19.020> to<00:03:19.110> be<00:03:19.290> five<00:03:19.650> and

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 
here so this one is going to be five and

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.770 
here so this one is going to be five and
seven<00:03:20.250> and<00:03:20.459> this<00:03:20.610> one<00:03:20.850> is<00:03:20.970> gonna<00:03:21.060> be<00:03:21.270> seven<00:03:21.690> and

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
seven and this one is gonna be seven and

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:24.350 
seven and this one is gonna be seven and
five<00:03:22.020> and<00:03:22.380> which<00:03:23.040> one<00:03:23.280> of<00:03:23.310> those<00:03:23.490> is<00:03:23.790> actually

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:24.360 
five and which one of those is actually

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:27.050 
five and which one of those is actually
gonna<00:03:24.510> come<00:03:24.780> out<00:03:24.930> when<00:03:25.260> we<00:03:25.410> touch<00:03:25.620> it<00:03:25.830> only<00:03:26.550> God

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:27.060 
gonna come out when we touch it only God

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:32.300 
gonna come out when we touch it only God
knows<00:03:28.010> so<00:03:29.010> again<00:03:29.900> 128<00:03:30.900> qubits<00:03:31.470> is<00:03:31.650> the<00:03:31.830> current

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
knows so again 128 qubits is the current

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:35.690 
knows so again 128 qubits is the current
computer<00:03:33.030> the<00:03:33.390> d-wave<00:03:33.750> is<00:03:33.959> working<00:03:34.320> on<00:03:34.410> it's<00:03:35.340> a

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:35.700 
computer the d-wave is working on it's a

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:39.290 
computer the d-wave is working on it's a
lot<00:03:36.420> a<00:03:36.720> lot<00:03:37.200> of<00:03:37.470> cores<00:03:38.100> by<00:03:38.820> the<00:03:38.880> time<00:03:39.030> we<00:03:39.120> get<00:03:39.240> to

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:39.300 
lot a lot of cores by the time we get to

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:41.420 
lot a lot of cores by the time we get to
three<00:03:39.600> hundred<00:03:39.810> qubits<00:03:40.410> we<00:03:40.830> will<00:03:40.950> actually<00:03:41.130> be

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:41.430 
three hundred qubits we will actually be

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:43.880 
three hundred qubits we will actually be
able<00:03:41.520> to<00:03:41.730> handle<00:03:42.150> more<00:03:42.390> cores<00:03:42.870> then<00:03:43.560> there<00:03:43.770> are

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:43.890 
able to handle more cores then there are

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:48.260 
able to handle more cores then there are
observable<00:03:44.640> atoms<00:03:45.060> in<00:03:45.270> the<00:03:45.480> universe<00:03:45.750> and<00:03:47.270> how

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:48.270 
observable atoms in the universe and how

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:50.110 
observable atoms in the universe and how
will<00:03:48.480> this<00:03:48.540> impact<00:03:48.840> you<00:03:49.140> as<00:03:49.350> a<00:03:49.380> programmer

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:50.120 
will this impact you as a programmer

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:52.130 
will this impact you as a programmer
will<00:03:51.120> do<00:03:51.270> wave<00:03:51.450> is<00:03:51.660> looking<00:03:51.990> at

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:52.140 
will do wave is looking at

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:54.530 
will do wave is looking at
platform-as-a-service<00:03:52.950> and<00:03:53.730> just<00:03:54.270> to<00:03:54.330> get<00:03:54.450> an

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:54.540 
platform-as-a-service and just to get an

platform-as-a-service and just to get an

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:56.250 
idea of what that might actually look at

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:59.270 
idea of what that might actually look at
it's<00:03:56.880> worth<00:03:57.150> noting<00:03:57.540> that<00:03:57.600> Jeff<00:03:57.930> Bezos<00:03:58.170> is<00:03:58.620> a

00:03:59.270 --> 00:03:59.280 
it's worth noting that Jeff Bezos is a

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:02.180 
it's worth noting that Jeff Bezos is a
major<00:03:59.820> investor<00:04:00.450> in<00:04:00.480> d-wave<00:04:01.230> so<00:04:01.920> you<00:04:01.980> should

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:02.190 
major investor in d-wave so you should

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:04.520 
major investor in d-wave so you should
expect<00:04:02.400> that<00:04:02.850> part<00:04:03.420> of<00:04:03.630> your<00:04:03.750> Amazon<00:04:04.230> services

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:04.530 
expect that part of your Amazon services

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:06.890 
expect that part of your Amazon services
in<00:04:05.040> the<00:04:05.220> future<00:04:05.640> are<00:04:05.880> going<00:04:06.180> to<00:04:06.390> include<00:04:06.750> the

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:06.900 
in the future are going to include the

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:09.680 
in the future are going to include the
ability<00:04:06.990> to<00:04:07.350> run<00:04:08.010> a<00:04:08.280> quantum<00:04:08.910> computing<00:04:09.420> job

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:09.690 
ability to run a quantum computing job

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:12.650 
ability to run a quantum computing job
at<00:04:10.110> your<00:04:10.590> will<00:04:10.820> thanks<00:04:11.820> for<00:04:11.970> listening<00:04:12.330> and<00:04:12.540> I

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:12.660 
at your will thanks for listening and I

at your will thanks for listening and I
hope<00:04:12.690> there's<00:04:13.110> a<00:04:13.170> lot<00:04:13.350> more<00:04:13.590> quantum

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:14.070 
hope there's a lot more quantum

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:17.180 
hope there's a lot more quantum
