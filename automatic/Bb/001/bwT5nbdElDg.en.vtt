00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:05.720 
while whilst you're attacking and it

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:07.420

makes<00:04:05.900> a<00:04:06.020> massive<00:04:06.260> difference<00:04:06.410> it<00:04:06.890> stops<00:04:07.220> that

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:07.430 
makes a massive difference it stops that

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:09.700 
makes a massive difference it stops that
gap<00:04:07.670> from<00:04:08.240> being<00:04:08.840> opened<00:04:09.380> up<00:04:09.500> by<00:04:09.650> the
