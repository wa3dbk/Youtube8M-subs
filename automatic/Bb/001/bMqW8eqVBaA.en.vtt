00:00:01.970 --> 00:00:05.120 

like<00:00:02.970> I<00:00:03.149> is<00:00:03.210> just<00:00:03.480> doing<00:00:04.049> a<00:00:04.200> quick<00:00:04.560> video<00:00:04.890> on

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:05.130 
like I is just doing a quick video on

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.379 
like I is just doing a quick video on
this<00:00:05.660> UPS<00:00:06.919> which<00:00:07.919> I've<00:00:08.130> been<00:00:08.700> given<00:00:08.970> from<00:00:09.150> work

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:09.389 
this UPS which I've been given from work

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:11.030 
this UPS which I've been given from work
they're<00:00:09.780> throwing<00:00:10.110> it<00:00:10.200> out<00:00:10.320> because<00:00:10.679> it's<00:00:10.889> one

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040 
they're throwing it out because it's one

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.459 
they're throwing it out because it's one
of<00:00:11.160> those<00:00:11.370> Falcon<00:00:11.940> ones<00:00:12.389> which<00:00:12.690> are<00:00:12.929> designed

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
of those Falcon ones which are designed

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:15.620 
of those Falcon ones which are designed
to<00:00:13.590> not<00:00:14.009> have<00:00:14.400> the<00:00:14.549> batteries<00:00:14.940> replaced

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
to not have the batteries replaced

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:17.480 
to not have the batteries replaced
you've<00:00:16.350> got<00:00:16.529> to<00:00:16.650> literally<00:00:17.010> dig<00:00:17.190> out<00:00:17.340> the

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
you've got to literally dig out the

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:18.859 
you've got to literally dig out the
circuit<00:00:17.910> board<00:00:18.150> take<00:00:18.480> out<00:00:18.660> all<00:00:18.779> the

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
circuit board take out all the

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:20.900 
circuit board take out all the
connectors<00:00:19.500> take<00:00:20.039> the<00:00:20.189> transformer<00:00:20.820> out

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
connectors take the transformer out

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:22.640 
connectors take the transformer out
everything<00:00:21.359> basically<00:00:21.869> just<00:00:22.170> to<00:00:22.289> get<00:00:22.439> to<00:00:22.560> the

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
everything basically just to get to the

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.679 
everything basically just to get to the
batteries<00:00:23.039> much<00:00:23.880> like<00:00:24.090> taking<00:00:24.480> the<00:00:24.570> engine

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
batteries much like taking the engine

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:26.720 
batteries much like taking the engine
out<00:00:24.900> of<00:00:25.019> a<00:00:25.080> car<00:00:25.320> just<00:00:26.010> to<00:00:26.130> change<00:00:26.340> the<00:00:26.430> wheels

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
out of a car just to change the wheels

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.609 
out of a car just to change the wheels
it's<00:00:26.970> crazy<00:00:27.660> they're<00:00:27.960> not<00:00:28.080> designed<00:00:28.410> to<00:00:28.500> be

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
it's crazy they're not designed to be

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:31.700 
it's crazy they're not designed to be
maintained<00:00:29.490> at<00:00:29.670> all<00:00:29.990> so<00:00:30.990> you<00:00:31.109> buy<00:00:31.289> in<00:00:31.349> the<00:00:31.439> last

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
maintained at all so you buy in the last

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.229 
maintained at all so you buy in the last
of<00:00:31.859> three<00:00:32.219> years<00:00:32.460> as<00:00:32.610> long<00:00:32.730> as<00:00:32.820> the<00:00:32.880> batteries

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
of three years as long as the batteries

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:34.700 
of three years as long as the batteries
last<00:00:33.270> and<00:00:33.719> then<00:00:33.809> that's<00:00:33.989> it<00:00:34.230> you've<00:00:34.559> thrown

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
last and then that's it you've thrown

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.389 
last and then that's it you've thrown
away<00:00:34.860> buy<00:00:35.160> a<00:00:35.190> new<00:00:35.399> one<00:00:35.570> Burt<00:00:36.800> if<00:00:37.800> you<00:00:38.250> are

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
away buy a new one Burt if you are

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:41.240 
away buy a new one Burt if you are
patient<00:00:38.670> you<00:00:38.969> can<00:00:39.210> actually<00:00:39.980> take<00:00:40.980> all<00:00:41.160> that

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
patient you can actually take all that

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:42.950 
patient you can actually take all that
out<00:00:41.309> and<00:00:41.460> do<00:00:41.700> that<00:00:41.820> it<00:00:41.969> is<00:00:42.030> possible<00:00:42.600> it<00:00:42.719> just

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
out and do that it is possible it just

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.060 
out and do that it is possible it just
takes<00:00:43.440> a<00:00:43.559> long<00:00:43.680> time<00:00:43.980> so<00:00:45.739> that's<00:00:46.739> what<00:00:46.980> I'm

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
takes a long time so that's what I'm

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:48.470 
takes a long time so that's what I'm
going<00:00:47.219> to<00:00:47.280> be<00:00:47.340> doing<00:00:47.520> but<00:00:47.760> before<00:00:48.090> I<00:00:48.120> do<00:00:48.210> that<00:00:48.300> I

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
going to be doing but before I do that I

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.110 
going to be doing but before I do that I
just<00:00:48.690> want<00:00:48.840> to<00:00:48.899> him<00:00:49.110> just<00:00:50.100> check<00:00:50.700> the

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
just want to him just check the

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.029 
just want to him just check the
everything's<00:00:51.600> working<00:00:52.050> okay<00:00:52.320> I<00:00:52.739> know<00:00:52.860> that

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
everything's working okay I know that

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:56.420 
everything's working okay I know that
the<00:00:53.160> air<00:00:53.280> the<00:00:53.399> batteries<00:00:53.820> are<00:00:54.350> flat<00:00:55.350> at<00:00:56.219> the

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
the air the batteries are flat at the

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.040 
the air the batteries are flat at the
moment<00:00:56.730> to<00:00:56.820> see<00:00:56.940> what<00:00:56.969> I'm<00:00:57.239> doing<00:00:57.539> I've<00:00:57.750> got

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
moment to see what I'm doing I've got

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.049 
moment to see what I'm doing I've got
them<00:00:58.260> connected<00:00:58.829> up<00:00:58.980> to<00:01:00.079> a<00:01:01.079> power<00:01:01.859> supply

00:01:02.049 --> 00:01:02.059 
them connected up to a power supply

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:05.570 
them connected up to a power supply
which<00:01:03.059> is<00:01:03.210> going<00:01:03.329> to<00:01:03.420> simulate<00:01:03.629> the<00:01:04.580> battery

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
which is going to simulate the battery

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.310 
which is going to simulate the battery
voltage<00:01:05.610> here<00:01:06.090> there<00:01:06.570> are<00:01:06.630> two<00:01:06.780> 12-volt

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
voltage here there are two 12-volt

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.550 
voltage here there are two 12-volt
batteries<00:01:08.030> wired<00:01:09.030> up<00:01:09.210> in<00:01:09.360> series<00:01:09.750> which<00:01:10.290> makes

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
batteries wired up in series which makes

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.590 
batteries wired up in series which makes
it<00:01:10.740> 12<00:01:11.720> 12<00:01:12.720> to<00:01:12.930> 24<00:01:13.409> so<00:01:14.280> I'll<00:01:14.640> just<00:01:14.880> take<00:01:15.479> the

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
it 12 12 to 24 so I'll just take the

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:25.170 
it 12 12 to 24 so I'll just take the
lamp<00:01:16.970> 24<00:01:17.970> volts

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:25.180 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:27.330 

just<00:01:25.900> to<00:01:26.020> simulate<00:01:26.290> that<00:01:26.530> battery<00:01:26.950> voltage

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:27.340 
just to simulate that battery voltage

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:35.240 
just to simulate that battery voltage
first<00:01:31.050> okay<00:01:32.050> 24<00:01:32.500> volts<00:01:33.660> okay

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
first okay 24 volts okay

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.340 
first okay 24 volts okay
but<00:01:36.250> the<00:01:36.430> multimeter<00:01:37.240> set<00:01:37.720> to<00:01:37.870> measure<00:01:38.080> the

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:38.350 
but the multimeter set to measure the

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:41.070 
but the multimeter set to measure the
the<00:01:38.800> input<00:01:39.130> voltage<00:01:39.520> in<00:01:39.910> them<00:01:40.150> so<00:01:40.810> I'll<00:01:40.900> just

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:41.080 
the input voltage in them so I'll just

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:46.980 
the input voltage in them so I'll just
switch<00:01:41.290> that<00:01:41.320> on<00:01:42.420> power<00:01:43.420> to<00:01:43.630> the<00:01:43.720> UPS<00:01:45.990> twenty

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:46.990 
switch that on power to the UPS twenty

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:54.780 
switch that on power to the UPS twenty
fifty<00:01:47.260> volts<00:01:48.630> switch<00:01:49.630> the<00:01:49.810> UPS<00:01:50.229> on<00:01:53.790> okay

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:54.790 
fifty volts switch the UPS on okay

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:56.910 
fifty volts switch the UPS on okay
that's<00:01:55.660> two<00:01:55.780> hundred<00:01:55.840> fifty<00:01:56.229> volts<00:01:56.380> and<00:01:56.650> also

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:56.920 
that's two hundred fifty volts and also

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:00.359 
that's two hundred fifty volts and also
we<00:01:57.130> should<00:01:57.340> be<00:01:57.460> able<00:01:57.550> to<00:01:57.670> see<00:01:57.880> a<00:01:58.950> sine<00:01:59.950> wave<00:01:59.979> now

00:02:00.359 --> 00:02:00.369 
we should be able to see a sine wave now

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:05.999 
we should be able to see a sine wave now
a<00:02:03.869> reason<00:02:04.869> to<00:02:04.960> bleep<00:02:05.110> your<00:02:05.320> sine<00:02:05.619> wave<00:02:05.800> outs

00:02:05.999 --> 00:02:06.009 
a reason to bleep your sine wave outs

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:07.650 
a reason to bleep your sine wave outs
based<00:02:06.280> on<00:02:06.490> this<00:02:06.640> transformer<00:02:07.330> here<00:02:07.420> anything

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:07.660 
based on this transformer here anything

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:09.660 
based on this transformer here anything
has<00:02:07.930> a<00:02:07.960> little<00:02:08.350> bit<00:02:08.470> of<00:02:08.590> a<00:02:08.709> clipping<00:02:09.280> issue<00:02:09.459> on

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:09.670 
has a little bit of a clipping issue on

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:11.370 
has a little bit of a clipping issue on
the<00:02:09.790> top<00:02:09.970> that's<00:02:10.330> why<00:02:10.540> it<00:02:10.600> looks<00:02:10.810> slightly

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:11.380 
the top that's why it looks slightly

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:16.229 
the top that's why it looks slightly
flat-topped<00:02:12.480> but<00:02:14.520> that's<00:02:15.520> it<00:02:15.730> all<00:02:15.850> hooked<00:02:16.030> up

00:02:16.229 --> 00:02:16.239 
flat-topped but that's it all hooked up

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:25.949 
flat-topped but that's it all hooked up
so<00:02:21.840> we<00:02:22.840> will<00:02:22.989> try<00:02:23.140> it<00:02:24.420> to<00:02:25.420> see<00:02:25.600> what<00:02:25.720> happened

00:02:25.949 --> 00:02:25.959 
so we will try it to see what happened

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:29.720 
so we will try it to see what happened
so<00:02:25.989> we've<00:02:26.200> turned<00:02:26.530> the<00:02:26.650> power<00:02:26.830> off<00:02:26.950> the<00:02:27.250> UPS

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
so we've turned the power off the UPS

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:33.780 
so we've turned the power off the UPS
okay<00:02:31.380> that's<00:02:32.380> off<00:02:32.560> and<00:02:32.860> then<00:02:33.430> you<00:02:33.519> get<00:02:33.610> that

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 
okay that's off and then you get that

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:37.199 
okay that's off and then you get that
nasty<00:02:34.450> horrible<00:02:34.959> looking<00:02:35.440> square<00:02:35.799> wave<00:02:36.209> which

00:02:37.199 --> 00:02:37.209 
nasty horrible looking square wave which

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:39.570 
nasty horrible looking square wave which
is<00:02:37.239> basically<00:02:37.810> simulating<00:02:38.410> the<00:02:38.709> sine<00:02:39.340> wave

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:39.580 
is basically simulating the sine wave

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:41.850 
is basically simulating the sine wave
and<00:02:39.820> it's<00:02:40.510> beeping<00:02:40.900> at<00:02:41.049> is<00:02:41.290> telling<00:02:41.739> us<00:02:41.799> that

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:41.860 
and it's beeping at is telling us that

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:45.630 
and it's beeping at is telling us that
there's<00:02:42.250> no<00:02:42.400> power<00:02:42.610> on<00:02:42.850> there<00:02:44.459> look<00:02:45.459> at<00:02:45.549> this

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:45.640 
there's no power on there look at this

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:49.949 
there's no power on there look at this
sine<00:02:45.910> wave<00:02:46.320> and<00:02:47.320> see<00:02:47.590> how<00:02:48.280> awful<00:02:48.730> it<00:02:48.850> is<00:02:49.030> from

00:02:49.949 --> 00:02:49.959 
sine wave and see how awful it is from

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:51.840 
sine wave and see how awful it is from
wife<00:02:50.140> some<00:02:50.380> some<00:02:50.950> bits<00:02:51.160> of<00:02:51.250> equipment<00:02:51.340> don't

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:51.850 
wife some some bits of equipment don't

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:53.490 
wife some some bits of equipment don't
really<00:02:52.269> like<00:02:52.420> to<00:02:52.570> run<00:02:52.720> on<00:02:52.750> these<00:02:52.989> things<00:02:53.260> with

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:53.500 
really like to run on these things with

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:56.250 
really like to run on these things with
these<00:02:53.620> kind<00:02:53.890> of<00:02:53.920> sine<00:02:54.100> waves<00:02:54.510> that<00:02:55.510> generally

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:56.260 
these kind of sine waves that generally

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.500 
these kind of sine waves that generally
computers<00:02:56.769> can<00:02:56.950> handle<00:02:57.220> that<00:02:57.370> it's<00:02:58.090> designed

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:58.510 
computers can handle that it's designed

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:03.360 
computers can handle that it's designed
for<00:02:59.519> so<00:03:00.519> appears<00:03:01.360> to<00:03:01.480> be<00:03:01.570> working<00:03:02.370> it's

00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:55.579 
can run a computer on that or it can run

00:03:55.579 --> 00:03:59.199 
can run a computer on that or it can run
if<00:03:56.419> you<00:03:56.629> have<00:03:56.750> a<00:03:56.780> bits<00:03:57.019> and<00:03:57.200> pieces<00:03:57.379> bit<00:03:58.209> that's

00:03:59.199 --> 00:03:59.209 
if you have a bits and pieces bit that's

the plan I really ain't got one of these
actually<00:04:00.769> on<00:04:00.829> my<00:04:00.950> computer<00:04:01.489> so<00:04:01.609> I<00:04:01.639> might<00:04:01.909> give

00:04:02.369 --> 00:04:02.379 
actually on my computer so I might give

00:04:02.379 --> 00:04:06.970 
actually on my computer so I might give
give<00:04:03.379> one<00:04:03.560> to<00:04:04.120> my<00:04:05.120> brother<00:04:05.389> or<00:04:06.169> someone<00:04:06.439> my

give one to my brother or someone my

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:09.220 
give one to my brother or someone my
sister<00:04:07.340> possibly<00:04:07.790> might<00:04:08.750> like<00:04:08.930> one<00:04:09.079> of<00:04:09.139> those

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:09.230 
sister possibly might like one of those

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:13.860 
sister possibly might like one of those
are<00:04:09.409> their<00:04:09.530> computers<00:04:10.040> so<00:04:10.900> it's<00:04:11.900> pretty<00:04:12.079> cool

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:13.870 
are their computers so it's pretty cool
