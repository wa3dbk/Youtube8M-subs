00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.510
 Hello everyone, which video are you now? 

00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:06.120
 look she was not scheduled 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:08.670
 just now there was a small one 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:11.490
 the thing that made me shoot it 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:13.320
 video and talk to certain 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.929
 by people who may ever be 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:18.330
 watch me show name. possibly 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:20.789
 this video will be a bit like the first one 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.680
 videos but like i'm not really they don't 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:23.340
 similar they differ radically in their 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.039
 missions 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.930
 the fact that they had to bring these videos 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.960
 which merge now I want to express 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:32.969
 their support to all the guys who 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:35.309
 being bullied at school or being bullied at the institute 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:37.860
 loving life which treats both 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:40.559
 something obscene to something low 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:43.079
 who do not really respect I think 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:45.719
 that almost every school has such 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:47.940
 guys who do not like whose banter 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:50.370
 for the appearance and liza and some 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.199
 actions without understanding there what 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.070
 man if you are my viewer who 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:56.039
 now it looks 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:58.829
 treat such guys want 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:00.770
 just say you're awesome ones 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:04.290
 people who look down on you 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:07.229
 they are not worth anything worth Wahhabi 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:09.930
 they are not worth the tears of the project, they do not deserve 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:12.299
 your total experiences you should 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.950
 I really understand them 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:16.229
 that and the mountains maybe it's very difficult 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:19.470
 do not pay attention to the insults 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:22.500
 that really hurt you 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:24.750
 well this is important because you know 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.340
 probably what many have told you that 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.770
 if you don't pay attention then 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:32.280
 they calm down really no they don't 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.680
 calm down they will come up with new 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.570
 ways 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:39.990
 excel contrive to hurt you 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:42.270
 you just build a wall between you 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:46.140
 and these unpleasant people to you 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:50.730
 must leave their world when they are near 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:52.890
 if you do not want to think how many 

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:56.130
 that there are a bunch of friends a bunch of friends 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:58.200
 it is good not really it is very 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:00.270
 dangerous because when you have 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.790
 for example, even 10 close friends 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.540
 then you ca n't be sure of everyone on 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:08.550
 one hundred percent 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:10.780
 I think that man q is enough 2 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:14.380
 close friend 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:16.209
 but a lot is not all like you are close 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:17.950
 some friends will just be acquaintances 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:21.400
 then you will consider them close 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:23.620
 friends when you have one close 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:25.930
 friend can you talk to him and not 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:29.380
 tell him everything and for example if these 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:31.810
 problems at school with classmates or 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:34.569
 traces of the older such also happens on 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:36.580
 school there is such a case then just later 

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:39.459
 come to your friend and tell him everything 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:42.489
 what do you think about them is not bad when 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:44.050
 close and most importantly not the key or your 

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:47.190
 friend you just tell him what 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:49.810
 tell you you're sick of a friend 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:50.470
 help will help even your 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:52.660
 presence 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:55.510
 so that Wang and charges stub so that he 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:57.190
 he will listen to himself for now that you are not alone 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:58.840
 or are you just because I'm not here 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:00.040
 pay attention to those assholes 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:02.260
 who insult me 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:05.080
 I just have a friend or just 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:07.090
 close friend and he supports me and i 

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:09.459
 he needs such a doll there when 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:10.060
 change for the sake of all strangers 

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:12.489
 for the sake of 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:16.420
 classmates arabia people who you 

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:18.590
 condemn you get better when you 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:21.019
 you do the same 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:21.739
 if these people tell you that you 

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:24.800
 terrible 

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:26.810
 go and take care of yourself may not speak 

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:29.239
 you repeat 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:31.459
 you know it has to do for himself or 

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:33.860
 for them you will do it for them you are not 

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:36.230
 you will be happy you must love 

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:38.780
 first of all i have to love myself 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:41.090
 yourself with all your acne with all 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:43.459
 your problems with all your 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:45.230
 disadvantages you must love yourself 

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:47.330
 so what you are and then people around 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:48.440
 they really try to wash you 

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:52.160
 it sounds 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:54.530
 that on them and all well-known not 

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:57.110
 you think too everyone says that and that 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:58.550
 so really if you love yourself 

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:01.040
 people will love themselves 

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:04.040
 they will start to see that with really 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:07.519
 interesting person i can't say that 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:09.620
 looks she has no importance 

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:11.780
 In fact, as if I did not want to 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:14.480
 was the appearance she is really important 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:16.160
 not the most important thing of course per person with 

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:18.229
 first glance will not see fair 

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:21.269
 inner measure your beautiful soul 

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:24.810
 so look nice saying to each 

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:26.280
 although again as a skull comfortable I 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:29.009
 a bit off topic 

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:32.129
 I think it's time for the tank not to return those 

00:04:29.009 --> 00:04:34.830
 guys who condemn the school but what 

00:04:32.129 --> 00:04:38.099
 they are i appeal to you i want 

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:39.720
 say something personal and myself with you i 

00:04:38.099 --> 00:04:41.280
 always probably support you 

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:44.069
 there are people around you 

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:46.979
 simple support does not protrude not 

00:04:44.069 --> 00:04:50.000
 all brave not all declare to the world 

00:04:46.979 --> 00:04:53.210
 that they are different 

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:55.789
 Here's the overall vision of the masses 

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:58.039
 so as not to do as they do 

00:04:55.789 --> 00:05:00.770
 it's not bad for you to do it yourself especially 

00:04:58.039 --> 00:05:02.360
 it makes you interesting it makes 

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:04.160
 themselves stand out among 

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:06.650
 excessive should probably also thing on 

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:08.720
 this to the pain 

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:11.360
 never embarrass with it for what not 

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:14.270
 embarrass someone else i hope 

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:19.569
 that it was not advice I just hope 

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:22.880
 what are you guys who have problems with 

00:05:19.569 --> 00:05:25.069
 peer peers and understanding with 

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:27.860
 him just accept yourself as you are 

00:05:25.069 --> 00:05:30.830
 there is something to change in yourself if you 

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:33.080
 want this flight which side you 

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:35.680
 move i hope you all will 

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:35.680
 are happy
