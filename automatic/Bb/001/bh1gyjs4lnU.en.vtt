00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
half inches square and then it goes into

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.019 
half inches square and then it goes into
this<00:00:24.109> fire<00:00:25.109> stack<00:00:25.470> there<00:00:25.710> that's<00:00:26.010> it's<00:00:26.910> about

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
this fire stack there that's it's about

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:28.910 
this fire stack there that's it's about
four<00:00:27.359> and<00:00:27.480> a<00:00:27.510> half<00:00:27.570> inch<00:00:27.930> outside<00:00:28.470> diameter

inside diameter goes up into the pipe of

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.340 
inside diameter goes up into the pipe of
course<00:00:35.489> got<00:00:36.390> a<00:00:36.420> few<00:00:36.630> things<00:00:36.780> left<00:00:37.079> to<00:00:37.170> do<00:00:37.320> I

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
course got a few things left to do I

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.530 
course got a few things left to do I
haven't<00:00:37.800> built<00:00:38.010> a<00:00:38.190> good<00:00:38.730> hopper<00:00:39.090> yet<00:00:39.270> for<00:00:39.450> the

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
haven't built a good hopper yet for the

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.229 
haven't built a good hopper yet for the
pellets<00:00:39.899> and<00:00:40.340> I<00:00:41.480> might<00:00:42.480> move<00:00:42.629> that<00:00:43.190> exhaust

00:00:44.229 --> 00:00:44.239 
pellets and I might move that exhaust

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:47.090 
pellets and I might move that exhaust
down<00:00:45.239> lower<00:00:45.570> so<00:00:45.989> I<00:00:46.050> can<00:00:46.230> keep<00:00:46.710> more<00:00:46.950> of<00:00:46.980> that

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
down lower so I can keep more of that

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.119 
down lower so I can keep more of that
heat<00:00:47.629> as<00:00:48.629> it<00:00:48.899> is<00:00:49.050> it<00:00:49.530> seems<00:00:49.770> to<00:00:49.890> be<00:00:50.010> working

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
heat as it is it seems to be working

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.340 
heat as it is it seems to be working
pretty<00:00:50.520> well<00:00:50.640> this<00:00:51.570> will<00:00:51.690> be<00:00:51.780> the<00:00:51.899> first<00:00:52.110> real

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
pretty well this will be the first real

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.680 
pretty well this will be the first real
test<00:00:52.680> of<00:00:52.949> it<00:00:53.100> did<00:00:53.969> run<00:00:54.120> up<00:00:54.270> quite<00:00:54.480> a<00:00:54.510> bit

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
test of it did run up quite a bit

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.340 
test of it did run up quite a bit
yesterday<00:00:54.899> and<00:00:56.480> but<00:00:57.480> it<00:00:57.539> was<00:00:57.660> it<00:00:57.840> was<00:00:57.870> a<00:00:57.960> nicer

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
yesterday and but it was it was a nicer

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.619 
yesterday and but it was it was a nicer
afternoon<00:00:58.829> so<00:00:59.640> I<00:00:59.699> couldn't<00:00:59.910> really<00:01:00.059> tell<00:01:00.480> the

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
afternoon so I couldn't really tell the

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:03.189 
afternoon so I couldn't really tell the
effectiveness<00:01:01.050> of<00:01:01.289> the<00:01:01.410> heat<00:01:01.440> I<00:01:01.829> did<00:01:02.309> add<00:01:02.550> a

00:01:03.189 --> 00:01:03.199 
effectiveness of the heat I did add a

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:07.270 
effectiveness of the heat I did add a
couple<00:01:04.199> of<00:01:04.610> extra<00:01:05.610> air<00:01:05.970> intakes<00:01:06.390> right<00:01:06.600> here

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:07.280 
couple of extra air intakes right here

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:12.500 
couple of extra air intakes right here
and<00:01:08.570> it<00:01:09.570> seems<00:01:09.810> to<00:01:09.900> really<00:01:10.110> help<00:01:11.510> hopefully

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
and it seems to really help hopefully

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.170 
and it seems to really help hopefully
one<00:01:12.810> of<00:01:12.840> you<00:01:12.960> guys<00:01:13.080> can<00:01:13.350> explain<00:01:13.939> why<00:01:14.939> that

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
one of you guys can explain why that

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.160 
one of you guys can explain why that
helps<00:01:15.540> but<00:01:16.700> anyway<00:01:17.700> it<00:01:17.850> goes<00:01:18.000> for<00:01:18.600> rocket<00:01:18.990> full

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
helps but anyway it goes for rocket full

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.120 
helps but anyway it goes for rocket full
throb<00:01:20.060> inside<00:01:21.060> here<00:01:21.619> let's<00:01:22.619> add<00:01:22.770> the<00:01:22.860> pellet

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
throb inside here let's add the pellet

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:26.630 
here there's the seeing the poles there

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:31.460 
here there's the seeing the poles there
I<00:02:28.820> do<00:02:29.820> see<00:02:30.300> that<00:02:30.420> insulation<00:02:30.900> there<00:02:31.230> that's

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
I do see that insulation there that's

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:36.020 
I do see that insulation there that's
some<00:02:31.709> oh<00:02:32.250> it's<00:02:33.000> a<00:02:33.709> kill<00:02:34.709> liner<00:02:35.130> blanket<00:02:35.760> kind

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
some oh it's a kill liner blanket kind

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:37.520 
some oh it's a kill liner blanket kind
of<00:02:36.209> stuff<00:02:36.390> I<00:02:36.570> don't<00:02:36.630> remember<00:02:36.930> exactly<00:02:37.350> what

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
of stuff I don't remember exactly what

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:40.520 
of stuff I don't remember exactly what
the<00:02:37.650> right<00:02:37.800> name<00:02:38.040> of<00:02:38.190> it<00:02:38.310> is<00:02:38.459> but<00:02:39.320> it<00:02:40.320> doesn't

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
the right name of it is but it doesn't

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:43.460 
the right name of it is but it doesn't
burn<00:02:40.769> up<00:02:40.800> at<00:02:41.100> all<00:02:41.250> underneath<00:02:42.239> that<00:02:42.480> it's<00:02:42.720> you

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
burn up at all underneath that it's you

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:44.960 
burn up at all underneath that it's you
know<00:02:43.500> glowing<00:02:43.860> red<00:02:44.070> hot<00:02:44.100> anyway<00:02:44.610> that's<00:02:44.760> most

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
know glowing red hot anyway that's most

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:48.590 
know glowing red hot anyway that's most
of<00:02:45.120> the<00:02:45.180> rocket<00:02:45.450> stove<00:02:45.630> knows<00:02:45.900> that<00:02:46.700> and<00:02:47.700> so

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:48.600 
of the rocket stove knows that and so

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:51.020 
of the rocket stove knows that and so
that's<00:02:49.170> just<00:02:49.290> some<00:02:49.560> insulation<00:02:49.920> that's<00:02:50.730> a

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
that's just some insulation that's a

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:53.300 
that's just some insulation that's a
part<00:02:52.019> of<00:02:52.080> additional<00:02:52.560> stuff<00:02:52.830> I<00:02:52.950> need<00:02:53.130> to<00:02:53.220> do

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
part of additional stuff I need to do

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:55.699 
part of additional stuff I need to do
and<00:02:53.459> that's<00:02:53.549> make<00:02:53.820> a<00:02:53.989> steel<00:02:54.989> surround<00:02:55.440> for

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:55.709 
and that's make a steel surround for

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:58.550 
and that's make a steel surround for
that<00:02:56.570> now<00:02:57.570> I<00:02:57.600> just<00:02:57.750> kind<00:02:58.019> of<00:02:58.140> drape<00:02:58.290> it<00:02:58.470> over

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
that now I just kind of drape it over

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:05.030 
that now I just kind of drape it over
there<00:02:58.940> the<00:02:59.940> Bell<00:03:00.120> temperature<00:03:01.459> see<00:03:02.459> that<00:03:04.040> top

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
there the Bell temperature see that top

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:09.530 
there the Bell temperature see that top
of<00:03:05.160> the<00:03:05.220> Bell<00:03:05.370> is<00:03:05.489> about<00:03:05.549> 650<00:03:06.180> and<00:03:08.510> outside<00:03:09.510> I

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
of the Bell is about 650 and outside I

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:11.840 
of the Bell is about 650 and outside I
take<00:03:09.930> you<00:03:10.079> outside<00:03:10.200> and<00:03:10.680> show<00:03:10.890> you<00:03:11.730> the

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:11.850 
take you outside and show you the

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:14.270 
take you outside and show you the
exhaust<00:03:12.150> there's<00:03:12.900> really<00:03:13.739> nothing<00:03:14.100> coming

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
exhaust there's really nothing coming

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:17.449 
exhaust there's really nothing coming
out<00:03:14.459> so<00:03:15.420> anyway<00:03:15.840> it's<00:03:16.140> cooking<00:03:16.380> along<00:03:16.560> started

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:17.459 
out so anyway it's cooking along started

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:18.860 
out so anyway it's cooking along started
here<00:03:17.610> we're<00:03:17.850> about<00:03:17.940> 40<00:03:18.329> minutes<00:03:18.510> into<00:03:18.750> the

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
here we're about 40 minutes into the

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:21.979 
here we're about 40 minutes into the
burn<00:03:19.049> and<00:03:19.400> since<00:03:20.400> it<00:03:20.519> started<00:03:20.850> rocketing<00:03:21.329> I<00:03:21.630> do

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:21.989 
burn and since it started rocketing I do

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:23.900 
burn and since it started rocketing I do
run<00:03:22.200> that<00:03:22.260> fan<00:03:22.739> on<00:03:23.250> medium<00:03:23.549> I've<00:03:23.670> got<00:03:23.820> it

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:23.910 
run that fan on medium I've got it

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:26.000 
run that fan on medium I've got it
turned<00:03:24.120> off<00:03:24.269> just<00:03:24.660> the<00:03:24.989> video<00:03:25.290> here<00:03:25.560> so<00:03:25.769> don't

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010 
turned off just the video here so don't

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:29.150 
turned off just the video here so don't
get<00:03:26.130> the<00:03:26.280> wind<00:03:26.400> noise<00:03:26.640> but<00:03:27.530> 10<00:03:28.530> feet<00:03:28.739> away<00:03:28.829> over

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:29.160 
get the wind noise but 10 feet away over

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:33.229 
get the wind noise but 10 feet away over
my<00:03:29.280> main<00:03:29.459> work<00:03:29.670> area<00:03:30.260> it's<00:03:31.260> now<00:03:31.470> 47<00:03:32.310> degrees<00:03:32.430> so

00:03:33.229 --> 00:03:33.239 
my main work area it's now 47 degrees so

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:35.270 
my main work area it's now 47 degrees so
it's<00:03:33.390> about<00:03:33.570> I<00:03:34.019> think<00:03:34.260> it<00:03:34.440> was<00:03:34.530> 34<00:03:34.890> when<00:03:35.250> I

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280 
it's about I think it was 34 when I

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:38.770 
it's about I think it was 34 when I
started<00:03:35.610> 40<00:03:35.910> minutes<00:03:36.150> ago<00:03:36.360> and<00:03:36.690> I<00:03:37.470> think<00:03:37.680> it's

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:38.780 
started 40 minutes ago and I think it's

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:40.819 
started 40 minutes ago and I think it's
27<00:03:39.780> or<00:03:39.900> something<00:03:40.140> like<00:03:40.200> that<00:03:40.290> outside<00:03:40.590> I

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:40.829 
27 or something like that outside I

00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:44.750 
27 or something like that outside I
can't<00:03:41.190> read<00:03:41.340> anyway<00:03:43.459> that's<00:03:44.459> how<00:03:44.549> it's

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:44.760 
can't read anyway that's how it's

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:46.100 
can't read anyway that's how it's
working<00:03:44.940> so<00:03:45.480> I'm<00:03:45.570> going<00:03:45.690> to<00:03:45.720> call<00:03:45.930> it<00:03:46.049> a

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:46.110 
working so I'm going to call it a

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:49.009 
working so I'm going to call it a
success<00:03:46.470> stepping<00:03:47.370> up<00:03:47.489> in<00:03:47.670> here<00:03:47.880> on<00:03:48.630> a<00:03:48.690> cool

00:03:49.009 --> 00:03:49.019 
success stepping up in here on a cool

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:52.360 
success stepping up in here on a cool
morning<00:03:49.230> like<00:03:49.590> this<00:03:49.799> that<00:03:50.549> I<00:03:50.610> can<00:03:50.640> actually<00:03:51.120> do

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:52.370 
morning like this that I can actually do

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:55.970 
morning like this that I can actually do
the<00:03:53.370> bird<00:03:53.579> and<00:03:53.820> I<00:03:54.780> move<00:03:55.320> the<00:03:55.410> gauge<00:03:55.590> down<00:03:55.829> to

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:55.980 
the bird and I move the gauge down to

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:58.870 
the bird and I move the gauge down to
the<00:03:56.070> side<00:03:56.340> it's<00:03:56.970> about<00:03:57.090> 425<00:03:57.630> on<00:03:58.049> to<00:03:58.169> the<00:03:58.260> side

00:03:58.870 --> 00:03:58.880 
the side it's about 425 on to the side

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:01.789 
the side it's about 425 on to the side
right<00:03:59.880> now<00:04:00.030> it's<00:04:00.209> about<00:04:00.480> 50<00:04:00.930> degrees<00:04:01.019> 10<00:04:01.590> feet

00:04:01.789 --> 00:04:01.799 
right now it's about 50 degrees 10 feet

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:05.750 
right now it's about 50 degrees 10 feet
away<00:04:02.090> over<00:04:03.090> my<00:04:03.239> main<00:04:03.419> work<00:04:03.600> area<00:04:03.810> and<00:04:04.370> it's<00:04:05.370> 25

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:05.760 
away over my main work area and it's 25

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:07.819 
away over my main work area and it's 25
out<00:04:06.030> settings<00:04:06.329> so<00:04:06.690> I<00:04:07.019> think<00:04:07.290> that's<00:04:07.590> pretty

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:07.829 
out settings so I think that's pretty

00:04:07.829 --> 00:04:08.300 
out settings so I think that's pretty
darn<00:04:08.070> good

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:08.310 
darn good

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:12.530 
darn good
so<00:04:09.180> anyway<00:04:09.930> I<00:04:10.290> think<00:04:10.500> that's<00:04:11.030> about<00:04:12.030> it<00:04:12.359> for

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:12.540 
so anyway I think that's about it for

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:13.099 
so anyway I think that's about it for
this<00:04:12.660> video

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:13.109 
this video

00:04:13.109 --> 00:04:14.810 
this video
exhale<00:04:13.620> I'll<00:04:13.949> probably<00:04:14.160> move<00:04:14.310> that<00:04:14.489> exhaust

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:14.820 
exhale I'll probably move that exhaust

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:16.340 
exhale I'll probably move that exhaust
down<00:04:15.150> a<00:04:15.180> little<00:04:15.480> bit<00:04:15.690> I<00:04:15.900> need<00:04:16.109> to<00:04:16.230> add<00:04:16.320> a

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:16.350 
down a little bit I need to add a

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:18.920 
down a little bit I need to add a
clean-out<00:04:16.709> and<00:04:17.329> there<00:04:18.329> is<00:04:18.389> a<00:04:18.449> clean-out<00:04:18.690> on

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:18.930 
clean-out and there is a clean-out on

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:21.170 
clean-out and there is a clean-out on
the<00:04:18.989> bottom<00:04:19.260> of<00:04:19.290> the<00:04:19.380> burger<00:04:19.590> too<00:04:20.060> but<00:04:21.060> I<00:04:21.120> like

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:21.180 
the bottom of the burger too but I like

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:28.480 
the bottom of the burger too but I like
to<00:04:21.299> clean<00:04:21.510> up<00:04:21.630> the<00:04:21.780> bottom<00:04:22.049> of<00:04:22.109> the<00:04:22.199> tank

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:28.490 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:33.430 

wait<00:04:29.490> till<00:04:29.699> the<00:04:30.240> nicer<00:04:30.540> day<00:04:30.690> for<00:04:30.870> that

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:33.440 

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:35.450 

overall<00:04:34.440> I'm<00:04:34.590> pretty<00:04:34.740> impressed<00:04:34.980> with<00:04:35.340> the

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:35.460 
overall I'm pretty impressed with the
