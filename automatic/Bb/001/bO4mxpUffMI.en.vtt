00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
and that's an amazing thing when you

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.920 
and that's an amazing thing when you
really<00:02:14.250> see<00:02:14.519> what<00:02:14.730> this<00:02:14.879> section<00:02:15.330> says<00:02:15.569> the

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
really see what this section says the

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:17.809

first verse in chapter 4 brings that out

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:20.690 
first verse in chapter 4 brings that out
so<00:02:18.060> clearly<00:02:18.480> he<00:02:19.140> says<00:02:19.410> the<00:02:19.560> spirit<00:02:20.310> expressly

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
so clearly he says the spirit expressly

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:23.000 
so clearly he says the spirit expressly
says<00:02:21.150> that<00:02:21.180> in<00:02:21.569> the<00:02:21.690> latter<00:02:21.870> times<00:02:22.050> some<00:02:22.470> will

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
says that in the latter times some will

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:25.220 
says that in the latter times some will
depart<00:02:23.310> from<00:02:23.760> the<00:02:23.849> faith<00:02:23.970> all<00:02:24.870> right<00:02:25.019> how<00:02:25.170> will

depart from the faith all right how will
they<00:02:25.470> depart<00:02:25.769> from<00:02:25.860> the<00:02:26.010> faith<00:02:26.040> he<00:02:26.760> says

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
they depart from the faith he says

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:29.089 
they depart from the faith he says
giving<00:02:27.390> heed<00:02:27.660> to<00:02:27.870> deceiving<00:02:28.019> spirits<00:02:28.920> and

00:02:29.089 --> 00:02:29.099 
giving heed to deceiving spirits and

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:32.300 
giving heed to deceiving spirits and
doctrines<00:02:29.819> of<00:02:30.390> demons<00:02:30.660> and<00:02:31.230> part<00:02:32.069> of<00:02:32.160> those

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
doctrines of demons and part of those

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:34.130 
doctrines of demons and part of those
doctrines<00:02:32.879> that<00:02:33.180> influence<00:02:33.810> from<00:02:34.019> the

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
doctrines that influence from the

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:36.890 
doctrines that influence from the
demonic<00:02:34.410> realms<00:02:35.010> are<00:02:35.459> those<00:02:35.819> that<00:02:36.239> forbid<00:02:36.690> to

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
demonic realms are those that forbid to

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.170 
demonic realms are those that forbid to
marry<00:02:37.200> like<00:02:37.680> you<00:02:37.799> mentioned<00:02:38.129> in<00:02:38.190> verse<00:02:38.340> 3<00:02:38.640> so

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
marry like you mentioned in verse 3 so

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:40.839 
marry like you mentioned in verse 3 so
it<00:02:39.269> wasn't<00:02:39.540> just<00:02:39.690> about<00:02:39.870> foods<00:02:40.260> they<00:02:40.470> also

00:02:40.839 --> 00:02:40.849 
it wasn't just about foods they also

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:44.300 
it wasn't just about foods they also
forbid<00:02:41.849> marriage<00:02:42.330> and<00:02:42.599> then<00:02:43.049> it<00:02:43.230> says<00:02:43.500> abstain

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
forbid marriage and then it says abstain

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:46.699 
forbid marriage and then it says abstain
from<00:02:44.579> foods<00:02:44.970> and<00:02:45.390> that<00:02:45.930> word<00:02:46.110> for<00:02:46.319> foods<00:02:46.500> there

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:46.709 
from foods and that word for foods there

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:48.380 
from foods and that word for foods there
means<00:02:46.890> any<00:02:47.099> kinds<00:02:47.400> of<00:02:47.430> foods<00:02:47.610> not<00:02:47.790> just<00:02:48.060> just

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
means any kinds of foods not just just

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:50.930 
means any kinds of foods not just just
not<00:02:48.540> meats<00:02:48.870> and<00:02:49.230> so<00:02:49.739> that's<00:02:50.099> what<00:02:50.340> Paul<00:02:50.579> was

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
not meats and so that's what Paul was

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:52.910 
not meats and so that's what Paul was
was<00:02:51.450> arguing<00:02:51.959> against<00:02:52.170> pointing<00:02:52.590> out<00:02:52.680> very

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 
was arguing against pointing out very

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:54.380 
was arguing against pointing out very
clearly<00:02:53.250> don't<00:02:53.610> get<00:02:53.819> involved<00:02:54.060> with<00:02:54.209> that

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 
clearly don't get involved with that

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:56.479 
clearly don't get involved with that
sort<00:02:54.660> of<00:02:54.750> thing<00:02:54.810> it's<00:02:55.079> it's<00:02:55.290> not<00:02:55.500> good<00:02:55.829> really

00:02:56.479 --> 00:02:56.489 
sort of thing it's it's not good really

00:02:56.489 --> 00:02:58.100 
sort of thing it's it's not good really
the<00:02:56.730> whole<00:02:56.760> context<00:02:57.540> and<00:02:57.840> the<00:02:57.930> whole

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
the whole context and the whole

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:59.930 
the whole context and the whole
background<00:02:58.590> to<00:02:59.040> this<00:02:59.160> subject<00:02:59.430> of<00:02:59.670> Paul<00:02:59.819> is

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940 
background to this subject of Paul is

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:03.710 
background to this subject of Paul is
addressing<00:03:00.420> is<00:03:00.780> a<00:03:00.840> heresy<00:03:01.500> that<00:03:01.709> really<00:03:02.720> had

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 
addressing is a heresy that really had

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.720 
addressing is a heresy that really had
some<00:03:03.959> really<00:03:04.230> unbalanced<00:03:05.010> approaches<00:03:05.459> toward

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
some really unbalanced approaches toward

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:08.960 
some really unbalanced approaches toward
not<00:03:05.849> only<00:03:06.560> marriage<00:03:07.560> and<00:03:07.890> foods<00:03:08.220> but<00:03:08.430> all<00:03:08.640> of

not only marriage and foods but all of

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:11.390 
not only marriage and foods but all of
physical<00:03:09.390> life<00:03:09.569> in<00:03:10.079> itself<00:03:10.470> and<00:03:10.799> denying<00:03:11.129> the
