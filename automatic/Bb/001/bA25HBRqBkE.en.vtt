you're going to want to quick swap it
into<00:01:01.140> the<00:01:01.320> anvil<00:01:02.010> and<00:01:02.250> basically<00:01:02.879> what<00:01:03.120> you're

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
into the anvil and basically what you're

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:04.460 
into the anvil and basically what you're
going<00:01:03.239> to<00:01:03.390> want<00:01:03.480> to<00:01:03.539> do<00:01:03.690> is<00:01:03.870> keep<00:01:04.110> swapping

going to want to do is keep swapping

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.609 
going to want to do is keep swapping
each<00:01:05.270> individual<00:01:06.270> row<00:01:06.570> and<00:01:06.840> it<00:01:07.140> works<00:01:07.409> the

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
each individual row and it works the

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:10.010 
each individual row and it works the
best<00:01:07.770> also<00:01:08.280> if<00:01:08.460> you<00:01:08.490> only<00:01:08.820> do<00:01:09.210> eight<00:01:09.510> instead

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
best also if you only do eight instead

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.840 
best also if you only do eight instead
of<00:01:10.140> nine<00:01:10.320> if<00:01:10.590> it<00:01:10.740> goes<00:01:10.890> to<00:01:11.070> nine<00:01:11.250> sometimes<00:01:11.700> it

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
of nine if it goes to nine sometimes it

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.460 
of nine if it goes to nine sometimes it
still<00:01:12.030> works<00:01:12.240> but<00:01:12.600> i<00:01:12.630> find<00:01:12.900> the<00:01:13.020> glitch<00:01:13.229> works

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
still works but i find the glitch works

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.170 
still works but i find the glitch works
a<00:01:13.590> lot<00:01:13.740> better<00:01:13.799> if<00:01:14.189> you<00:01:14.340> only<00:01:14.549> quick<00:01:14.880> swap

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
a lot better if you only quick swap

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.179 
a lot better if you only quick swap
eight<00:01:15.479> then<00:01:16.229> once<00:01:16.470> the<00:01:16.650> pieces<00:01:17.009> are

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
eight then once the pieces are

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.700 
eight then once the pieces are
duplicated<00:01:17.880> your<00:01:18.090> actual<00:01:18.780> blocks<00:01:19.140> will<00:01:19.350> be<00:01:19.500> on

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
duplicated your actual blocks will be on

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.499 
duplicated your actual blocks will be on
the<00:01:19.950> ground<00:01:20.100> by<00:01:20.460> the<00:01:20.490> anvil<00:01:21.030> and<00:01:21.240> the

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
the ground by the anvil and the

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:22.940 
the ground by the anvil and the
duplicated<00:01:22.110> blocks<00:01:22.320> will<00:01:22.500> be<00:01:22.619> in<00:01:22.799> your

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
duplicated blocks will be in your

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.230 
duplicated blocks will be in your
inventories<00:01:23.520> then<00:01:23.790> what<00:01:23.970> you're<00:01:24.060> going<00:01:24.150> to

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.270 
and switch the block over to its
original<00:01:27.810> state<00:01:28.350> such<00:01:28.710> as<00:01:28.740> if<00:01:29.009> you<00:01:29.100> have<00:01:29.250> a

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
original state such as if you have a

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:30.679 
original state such as if you have a
diamond<00:01:29.729> block<00:01:29.939> you<00:01:30.060> want<00:01:30.210> to<00:01:30.270> switch<00:01:30.450> to<00:01:30.570> the

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
diamond block you want to switch to the

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.929 
diamond block you want to switch to the
Diamonds<00:01:31.229> or<00:01:31.350> as<00:01:31.740> in<00:01:31.890> this<00:01:31.950> case<00:01:32.340> we<00:01:32.729> used

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
Diamonds or as in this case we used

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:34.580 
Diamonds or as in this case we used
emerald<00:01:33.390> blocks<00:01:33.630> so<00:01:33.840> we<00:01:33.960> want<00:01:34.140> to<00:01:34.200> switch<00:01:34.439> it

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
emerald blocks so we want to switch it

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.200 
emerald blocks so we want to switch it
to<00:01:34.619> emeralds<00:01:35.100> because<00:01:35.400> the<00:01:35.549> ones<00:01:35.790> that<00:01:35.970> are<00:01:36.060> in

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
to emeralds because the ones that are in

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:37.880 
to emeralds because the ones that are in
your<00:01:36.329> inventory<00:01:36.810> off<00:01:37.020> the<00:01:37.170> duplicated<00:01:37.710> ones

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
your inventory off the duplicated ones

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.069 
your inventory off the duplicated ones
and<00:01:38.130> if<00:01:38.610> you<00:01:38.729> don't<00:01:38.970> switch<00:01:39.299> it<00:01:39.329> to<00:01:39.540> the<00:01:39.780> actual

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
and if you don't switch it to the actual

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:42.410 
and if you don't switch it to the actual
emeralds<00:01:40.650> you'll<00:01:41.009> lose<00:01:41.280> those<00:01:41.610> blocks<00:01:42.000> then

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
emeralds you'll lose those blocks then

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:43.789
