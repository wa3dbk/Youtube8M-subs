00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:11.790
 where together and welcome 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:14.040
 to another racket is the is 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.320
 now from the series the price my 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:19.080
 darling the successor of a 4 3 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.210
 roddick is now called pure drive tour 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.920
 basically that's still one 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.420
 normal prodrive so normal 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.960
 Quotes just a bit 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.000
 severe 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:32.009
 that means framework conditions here 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:34.260
 diverted as follows 315 grams 131 5 m 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.540
 balance and the typical 16 19 pages 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.820
 picture, however, is also msi here 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.040
 which has been installed in principle only 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.590
 means the sweet spot is from here 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.149
 been transferred bit high for what 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.590
 Modern tennis is the case 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.390
 you meet a bit further up there 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.980
 let's get on with it and 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.360
 in total, the pages or pages 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.360
 pattern up very small bit closer 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.800
 now even more control 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:58.140
 in advance I can already say that is 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.460
 my current favorite pure drive you 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.469
 Just like it when he's a little bit more 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.489
 weight has a stable one 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:05.189
 bit by then comes right 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:06.780
 a lot to get out of it very very full 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:09.060
 Feeling was a lot of fun 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.189
 has always tends to q drive 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.939
 to properly full karacho on the walls 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.619
 it going 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:15.240
 that's what he's made for 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.979
 Of course, also very variable play 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.409
 and and of course very much with spin 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:20.820
 my personal main feature 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.530
 a pure drive when I think about it 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.540
 is usually only power 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.040
 but you can do that very well 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.210
 just check the version for 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.740
 even a little better 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.020
 control than the normal four 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.670
 hit version serve is one 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.770
 insolence if you have a long 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:37.290
 swing has say that is generally included 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.479
 the condition that you take a long swing 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.130
 Rather, styles has that easy 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:43.439
 Really long and a lot myself 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.520
 now nothing is for people only 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:46.470
 to come out of hand for example 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:49.110
 there is still a light version or 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.490
 also the normal prodrive optically find 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.020
 I made that animal to 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:54.500
 Predecessor is my personal opinion 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.610
 but I think that looks very good 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:58.320
 We already have msi technology 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.000
 The sweet spot did not appeal 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.530
 bit earlier and pure wallis 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.820
 That means that yes 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.829
 beater head a little bit more 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:06.630
 speed can absorb or 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:07.829
 At the meeting point you have a small one 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.700
 a bit more speed at 

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:10.590
 same momentum 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:12.180
 So hits all the below in 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.799
 end effect still comes with it 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:16.049
 Power out is great to dose 

00:02:13.799 --> 00:02:17.750
 So there you realize that in any case 

00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:20.250
 a lot was done on the frame 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:22.560
 Overall, it is also I find the im 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.980
 friendly for a normal ball on 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.170
 bat 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:26.939
 I would not have any problems with it 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:28.439
 will not get any, you can 

00:02:26.939 --> 00:02:29.849
 here's police slap and 

00:02:28.439 --> 00:02:31.469
 then everyone would have to know themselves 

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:33.150
 but for me it is a very successful one 

00:02:31.469 --> 00:02:34.889
 First off, a little more 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:37.560
 power second, but no lack of power 

00:02:34.889 --> 00:02:39.569
 control while he brings the ps already 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:41.700
 Very good on the road so that here 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:46.400
 is my personal favorite with the 43 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:46.400
 that was the pure drive to 2015
