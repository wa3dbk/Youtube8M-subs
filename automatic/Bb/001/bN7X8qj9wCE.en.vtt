00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.200 
know the wife's got a drawer full of
them<00:01:06.650> and<00:01:07.650> this<00:01:08.159> is<00:01:08.220> what<00:01:08.430> you<00:01:08.520> get<00:01:08.700> so<00:01:08.970> as<00:01:09.090> you

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
them and this is what you get so as you

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.230 
them and this is what you get so as you
can<00:01:09.299> see<00:01:09.659> it<00:01:09.930> is<00:01:10.140> very<00:01:10.650> very<00:01:11.100> similar<00:01:11.369> to<00:01:11.700> the

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
can see it is very very similar to the

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.100 
can see it is very very similar to the
OtterBox<00:01:12.689> Defender<00:01:13.939> so<00:01:14.939> we<00:01:15.630> don't<00:01:15.750> clip<00:01:15.960> that

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
OtterBox Defender so we don't clip that

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.140 
OtterBox Defender so we don't clip that
from<00:01:16.320> there<00:01:16.530> so<00:01:17.220> you've<00:01:17.400> got<00:01:17.520> that<00:01:17.640> belt<00:01:17.939> clip

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
from there so you've got that belt clip

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.399 
from there so you've got that belt clip
there<00:01:18.770> and<00:01:20.240> fully<00:01:21.240> rotatable<00:01:21.810> so<00:01:22.049> you<00:01:22.140> can<00:01:22.259> put

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
there and fully rotatable so you can put

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.350 
there and fully rotatable so you can put
it<00:01:22.470> into<00:01:22.590> whichever<00:01:23.189> orientation<00:01:23.939> you<00:01:24.030> wanted

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
it into whichever orientation you wanted

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.499 
it into whichever orientation you wanted
so<00:01:24.659> I'm<00:01:24.720> not<00:01:24.869> sure<00:01:24.960> if<00:01:25.290> you<00:01:25.409> could<00:01:25.530> maybe<00:01:26.509> use

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
so I'm not sure if you could maybe use

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:28.850 
so I'm not sure if you could maybe use
that<00:01:27.659> as<00:01:27.720> a<00:01:27.780> stand<00:01:28.110> I<00:01:28.200> think<00:01:28.409> that's<00:01:28.590> the<00:01:28.710> whole

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
that as a stand I think that's the whole

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.670 
that as a stand I think that's the whole
idea<00:01:28.890> of<00:01:29.250> it<00:01:29.430> to<00:01:29.549> be<00:01:29.640> honest<00:01:29.850> guys<00:01:30.000> and<00:01:30.680> I've

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
idea of it to be honest guys and I've

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.740 
idea of it to be honest guys and I've
not<00:01:31.890> seen<00:01:32.070> anything<00:01:32.280> about<00:01:32.670> it<00:01:33.000> but<00:01:33.600> I'm

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
not seen anything about it but I'm

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.390 
not seen anything about it but I'm
guessing<00:01:34.079> that<00:01:34.290> that's<00:01:34.500> what<00:01:34.740> that's<00:01:34.860> for<00:01:35.130> so

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
guessing that that's what that's for so

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:36.490 
guessing that that's what that's for so
you<00:01:35.490> can<00:01:35.579> actually<00:01:35.700> fasten<00:01:36.090> the<00:01:36.150> clip<00:01:36.329> over

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:36.500 
you can actually fasten the clip over

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:39.109 
you can actually fasten the clip over
don't<00:01:37.500> see<00:01:37.560> in<00:01:37.650> a<00:01:37.680> standing<00:01:38.009> position<00:01:38.040> you<00:01:38.970> can

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
don't see in a standing position you can

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.960 
don't see in a standing position you can
watch<00:01:39.299> a<00:01:39.390> movie<00:01:39.420> or<00:01:39.750> something<00:01:39.780> on<00:01:40.729> on<00:01:41.729> the

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
watch a movie or something on on the

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.850 
watch a movie or something on on the
table<00:01:42.270> with<00:01:42.390> it<00:01:42.509> or<00:01:42.630> something<00:01:42.899> like<00:01:43.020> that<00:01:43.079> so

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
table with it or something like that so

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.539 
table with it or something like that so
anyway<00:01:43.979> let's<00:01:44.939> put<00:01:45.180> that<00:01:45.570> bit<00:01:45.750> aside<00:01:46.130> and<00:01:47.130> get

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
anyway let's put that bit aside and get

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:50.149 
anyway let's put that bit aside and get
down<00:01:47.729> to<00:01:47.880> the<00:01:47.970> actual<00:01:48.270> case<00:01:48.710> so<00:01:49.710> we've<00:01:50.040> got

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
down to the actual case so we've got

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:54.770 
down to the actual case so we've got
this<00:01:50.399> bit<00:01:50.640> here<00:01:50.790> now<00:01:51.000> that<00:01:51.149> is<00:01:51.270> a<00:01:51.299> stand<00:01:53.689> and<00:01:54.689> I

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
this bit here now that is a stand and I

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.130 
this bit here now that is a stand and I
do<00:01:54.840> know<00:01:55.140> that<00:01:55.170> that's<00:01:55.439> a<00:01:55.560> stand<00:01:56.240> and<00:01:57.240> I'm<00:01:57.960> not

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
do know that that's a stand and I'm not

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.050 
do know that that's a stand and I'm not
quite<00:01:58.560> sure<00:01:58.619> which<00:01:59.369> way<00:01:59.610> it's<00:01:59.729> supposed<00:02:00.000> to

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
quite sure which way it's supposed to

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.990 
quite sure which way it's supposed to
really<00:02:00.390> sort<00:02:00.780> of<00:02:01.490> stand<00:02:02.490> it<00:02:02.610> or<00:02:02.700> whether<00:02:02.820> it's

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
really sort of stand it or whether it's

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.340 
really sort of stand it or whether it's
just<00:02:03.149> supposed<00:02:03.240> to<00:02:03.450> give<00:02:03.600> it<00:02:03.689> a<00:02:03.750> very<00:02:03.990> sort<00:02:04.290> of

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
just supposed to give it a very sort of

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.679 
just supposed to give it a very sort of
low<00:02:04.530> angle<00:02:04.950> which<00:02:05.820> would<00:02:06.240> make<00:02:06.420> a<00:02:06.450> bit<00:02:06.659> of

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
low angle which would make a bit of

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:07.969 
low angle which would make a bit of
sense<00:02:06.780> actually<00:02:07.110> that<00:02:07.469> that<00:02:07.649> gives<00:02:07.829> you<00:02:07.950> a

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
sense actually that that gives you a

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:09.949 
sense actually that that gives you a
nice<00:02:08.160> low<00:02:08.429> angle<00:02:08.789> that<00:02:08.910> you<00:02:09.030> could<00:02:09.179> sit<00:02:09.420> at<00:02:09.899> a

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
nice low angle that you could sit at a

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:11.360 
nice low angle that you could sit at a
table<00:02:10.200> I<00:02:10.500> mean<00:02:10.530> now<00:02:10.739> I'm<00:02:10.800> at<00:02:10.920> the<00:02:11.009> right<00:02:11.069> height

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
table I mean now I'm at the right height

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:12.970 
table I mean now I'm at the right height
now<00:02:11.610> to<00:02:11.670> actually<00:02:11.970> sit

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980 
now to actually sit

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:15.130 
now to actually sit
and<00:02:13.069> view<00:02:13.340> a<00:02:13.519> video<00:02:13.670> on<00:02:14.000> there<00:02:14.269> you<00:02:14.900> know<00:02:14.930> or

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:15.140 
and view a video on there you know or

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:16.960 
and view a video on there you know or
even<00:02:15.170> possibly<00:02:15.709> play<00:02:16.190> a<00:02:16.220> game<00:02:16.459> if<00:02:16.580> I<00:02:16.670> wanted<00:02:16.909> to

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:16.970 
even possibly play a game if I wanted to

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:18.729 
even possibly play a game if I wanted to
rest<00:02:17.390> it<00:02:17.510> down<00:02:17.690> sometimes<00:02:18.170> there<00:02:18.379> are<00:02:18.500> some

00:02:18.729 --> 00:02:18.739 
rest it down sometimes there are some

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:20.860 
rest it down sometimes there are some
games<00:02:19.010> where<00:02:19.280> resting<00:02:20.239> it<00:02:20.330> on<00:02:20.420> the<00:02:20.540> table

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:20.870 
games where resting it on the table

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:23.979 
games where resting it on the table
would<00:02:21.040> being<00:02:22.040> very<00:02:22.430> helpful<00:02:22.610> really<00:02:23.060> so<00:02:23.930> as

00:02:23.979 --> 00:02:23.989 
would being very helpful really so as

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:25.089 
would being very helpful really so as
you<00:02:24.080> can<00:02:24.200> see<00:02:24.319> you've<00:02:24.440> got<00:02:24.470> the<00:02:24.590> you<00:02:24.950> like

00:02:25.089 --> 00:02:25.099 
you can see you've got the you like

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:27.220 
you can see you've got the you like
bundling<00:02:25.430> through<00:02:25.640> there<00:02:25.849> as<00:02:26.000> well<00:02:26.209> so<00:02:26.510> that

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:27.230 
bundling through there as well so that

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:30.160 
bundling through there as well so that
rotates<00:02:27.680> all<00:02:27.890> around<00:02:28.159> the<00:02:28.250> place<00:02:28.489> and<00:02:29.170> just

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.170 
rotates all around the place and just

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:31.420 
rotates all around the place and just
goes<00:02:30.290> back<00:02:30.500> in<00:02:30.620> like<00:02:30.769> that<00:02:30.950> so<00:02:31.010> pretty

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:31.430 
goes back in like that so pretty

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:34.900 
goes back in like that so pretty
straightforward<00:02:32.920> if<00:02:33.920> we<00:02:34.010> take<00:02:34.190> that<00:02:34.370> rubber

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:34.910 
straightforward if we take that rubber

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:39.039 
straightforward if we take that rubber
shell<00:02:35.150> off<00:02:35.239> the<00:02:35.420> outer<00:02:35.569> ah<00:02:36.160> ah<00:02:37.810> those<00:02:38.810> ones

00:02:39.039 --> 00:02:39.049 
shell off the outer ah ah those ones

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:42.119 
shell off the outer ah ah those ones
don't<00:02:39.200> clip<00:02:39.440> it<00:02:39.560> down<00:02:39.590> this<00:02:39.890> time<00:02:40.069> right<00:02:40.250> okay

00:02:42.119 --> 00:02:42.129 
don't clip it down this time right okay

00:02:42.129 --> 00:02:44.920 
don't clip it down this time right okay
the<00:02:43.129> last<00:02:44.030> case<00:02:44.209> I<00:02:44.239> did<00:02:44.420> I<00:02:44.510> cut<00:02:44.659> them<00:02:44.750> in<00:02:44.840> which

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:44.930 
the last case I did I cut them in which

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:46.600 
the last case I did I cut them in which
case<00:02:44.989> it<00:02:45.319> was<00:02:45.560> cold<00:02:45.829> now<00:02:46.010> but<00:02:46.160> the<00:02:46.250> last<00:02:46.370> one<00:02:46.459> in

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:46.610 
case it was cold now but the last one in

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:48.339 
case it was cold now but the last one in
one<00:02:46.700> of<00:02:46.790> my<00:02:46.910> previous<00:02:47.239> videos<00:02:47.810> I<00:02:47.959> did<00:02:48.019> a<00:02:48.200> you

00:02:48.339 --> 00:02:48.349 
one of my previous videos I did a you

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:50.710 
one of my previous videos I did a you
like<00:02:48.500> case<00:02:48.799> and<00:02:49.129> it<00:02:50.090> had<00:02:50.239> like<00:02:50.420> these<00:02:50.540> little

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:50.720 
like case and it had like these little

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:52.080 
like case and it had like these little
novels<00:02:51.049> on<00:02:51.170> here<00:02:51.349> but<00:02:51.470> they<00:02:51.560> were<00:02:51.620> actually<00:02:51.859> a

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:52.090 
novels on here but they were actually a

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:54.430 
novels on here but they were actually a
like<00:02:53.090> a<00:02:53.120> thumb<00:02:53.420> clip<00:02:53.629> you<00:02:53.780> you<00:02:54.079> um<00:02:54.140> clipped

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:54.440 
like a thumb clip you you um clipped

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:56.199 
like a thumb clip you you um clipped
part<00:02:54.650> of<00:02:54.890> the<00:02:54.980> case<00:02:55.160> there<00:02:55.430> but<00:02:55.910> this<00:02:56.030> one

00:02:56.199 --> 00:02:56.209 
part of the case there but this one

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:58.509 
part of the case there but this one
obviously<00:02:56.359> it<00:02:57.260> doesn't<00:02:57.440> it<00:02:57.590> just<00:02:57.680> sort<00:02:58.340> pulls

00:02:58.509 --> 00:02:58.519 
obviously it doesn't it just sort pulls

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:02.380 
obviously it doesn't it just sort pulls
apart<00:02:58.670> basically<00:02:59.799> okay<00:03:00.799> then<00:03:00.950> so<00:03:01.879> let's<00:03:02.209> cut

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:02.390 
apart basically okay then so let's cut

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:04.150 
apart basically okay then so let's cut
it<00:03:02.480> in<00:03:02.599> so<00:03:02.780> there's<00:03:02.959> no<00:03:03.079> there's<00:03:03.500> no<00:03:03.560> lining<00:03:03.859> or

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:04.160 
it in so there's no there's no lining or

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:05.140 
it in so there's no there's no lining or
anything<00:03:04.340> like<00:03:04.609> that

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:05.150 
anything like that

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:07.270 
anything like that
so<00:03:05.390> you<00:03:05.930> know<00:03:06.049> those<00:03:06.319> of<00:03:06.530> you<00:03:06.709> that<00:03:06.890> are<00:03:07.040> a<00:03:07.069> bit

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:07.280 
so you know those of you that are a bit

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:08.920 
so you know those of you that are a bit
shy<00:03:07.910> of<00:03:07.940> that<00:03:08.209> sort<00:03:08.510> of<00:03:08.569> thing<00:03:08.629> I'm<00:03:08.780> gonna

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:08.930 
shy of that sort of thing I'm gonna

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:11.940 
shy of that sort of thing I'm gonna
smooth<00:03:09.620> this<00:03:09.799> for<00:03:10.010> me<00:03:10.069> to<00:03:10.160> cause<00:03:10.340> any<00:03:10.579> damage

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:11.950 
smooth this for me to cause any damage

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:18.039 
smooth this for me to cause any damage
and<00:03:14.950> bang<00:03:15.950> back<00:03:16.340> together<00:03:16.519> there<00:03:16.970> now<00:03:17.329> it<00:03:17.450> it

00:03:18.039 --> 00:03:18.049 
and bang back together there now it it

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:21.129 
and bang back together there now it it
gives<00:03:18.260> more<00:03:19.120> the<00:03:20.120> other<00:03:20.359> you<00:03:20.599> like<00:03:20.750> what<00:03:20.930> I<00:03:20.959> did

00:03:21.129 --> 00:03:21.139 
gives more the other you like what I did

00:03:21.139 --> 00:03:23.920 
gives more the other you like what I did
left<00:03:21.440> this<00:03:21.590> bottom<00:03:21.919> part<00:03:22.099> open<00:03:22.660> this<00:03:23.660> warm

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:23.930 
left this bottom part open this warm

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:26.170 
left this bottom part open this warm
doesn't<00:03:24.470> however<00:03:24.829> and<00:03:25.250> the<00:03:25.819> only<00:03:25.940> real

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:26.180 
doesn't however and the only real

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:28.720 
doesn't however and the only real
difference<00:03:26.209> between<00:03:26.690> this<00:03:27.650> and<00:03:27.709> the<00:03:28.130> defender

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:28.730 
difference between this and the defender

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:31.180 
difference between this and the defender
the<00:03:29.660> the<00:03:29.959> otterbox<00:03:30.319> defender<00:03:30.410> is<00:03:30.829> the<00:03:30.859> fact

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:31.190 
the the otterbox defender is the fact

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:34.199 
the the otterbox defender is the fact
that<00:03:31.280> this<00:03:32.209> has<00:03:32.359> got<00:03:32.510> a<00:03:32.569> like<00:03:32.959> a<00:03:32.989> full<00:03:33.230> on<00:03:33.319> an

00:03:34.199 --> 00:03:34.209 
that this has got a like a full on an

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:37.839 
that this has got a like a full on an
open<00:03:35.500> face<00:03:36.500> there<00:03:36.799> whereas<00:03:37.069> the<00:03:37.190> the<00:03:37.220> defender

00:03:37.839 --> 00:03:37.849 
open face there whereas the the defender

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:41.020 
open face there whereas the the defender
is<00:03:38.200> has<00:03:39.200> is<00:03:39.500> like<00:03:39.799> I<00:03:40.010> think<00:03:40.489> it's<00:03:40.730> classes<00:03:41.000> a

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:41.030 
is has is like I think it's classes a

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:43.420 
is has is like I think it's classes a
fully<00:03:41.269> waterproof<00:03:41.569> on<00:03:41.900> actually<00:03:42.260> pretty<00:03:43.250> sure

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:43.430 
fully waterproof on actually pretty sure

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:44.890 
fully waterproof on actually pretty sure
I<00:03:43.459> can't<00:03:43.849> really<00:03:43.970> remember<00:03:44.209> for<00:03:44.450> sure<00:03:44.660> but<00:03:44.780> I'm

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:44.900 
I can't really remember for sure but I'm

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:46.150 
I can't really remember for sure but I'm
sure<00:03:45.200> the<00:03:45.349> defender<00:03:45.709> is<00:03:45.829> actually<00:03:46.099> a

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:46.160 
sure the defender is actually a

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:48.550 
sure the defender is actually a
waterproof<00:03:46.639> case<00:03:46.880> so<00:03:47.690> it<00:03:47.810> has<00:03:47.930> a<00:03:47.959> fully<00:03:48.230> sealed

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:48.560 
waterproof case so it has a fully sealed

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:52.720
