you want to see how to make one um ask
you<00:00:12.690> know<00:00:12.809> by<00:00:13.049> name<00:00:13.110> um<00:00:14.870> yep<00:00:15.870> I<00:00:16.139> think<00:00:16.440> that's

all um alright that's good steady so
this<00:00:21.960> is<00:00:22.080> the<00:00:22.230> first<00:00:22.470> one<00:00:22.680> it's<00:00:22.890> the<00:00:22.920> basic

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
this is the first one it's the basic

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.519 
this is the first one it's the basic
square<00:00:23.670> I<00:00:23.880> didn't<00:00:24.449> make<00:00:24.570> this<00:00:24.779> my<00:00:24.990> friend<00:00:25.289> did

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
square I didn't make this my friend did

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:28.160 
square I didn't make this my friend did
um<00:00:25.820> but<00:00:26.820> you<00:00:27.060> know<00:00:27.090> it's<00:00:27.300> just<00:00:27.420> the<00:00:27.539> square<00:00:27.840> and

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
um but you know it's just the square and

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:29.750 
um but you know it's just the square and
then<00:00:28.230> she<00:00:28.560> put<00:00:28.710> a<00:00:28.740> bead<00:00:28.949> on<00:00:28.980> it<00:00:29.099> and<00:00:29.369> she<00:00:29.550> tied

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
then she put a bead on it and she tied

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.810 
then she put a bead on it and she tied
off<00:00:29.880> the<00:00:30.060> ends<00:00:30.449> um<00:00:30.840> I<00:00:31.560> do<00:00:31.740> have<00:00:31.949> another<00:00:32.309> square

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
off the ends um I do have another square

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.610 
off the ends um I do have another square
in<00:00:33.210> my<00:00:33.420> pile<00:00:33.660> here<00:00:34.280> this<00:00:35.280> one<00:00:35.430> I<00:00:35.460> made<00:00:35.780> um<00:00:36.780> you

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
in my pile here this one I made um you

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.080 
in my pile here this one I made um you
know<00:00:37.710> it's<00:00:37.860> real<00:00:38.100> short<00:00:38.370> and<00:00:38.489> simple<00:00:38.610> and<00:00:38.910> then

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
know it's real short and simple and then

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.200 
know it's real short and simple and then
finished<00:00:39.480> off<00:00:39.629> the<00:00:39.960> way<00:00:40.530> that<00:00:41.070> do<00:00:41.790> not<00:00:41.969> glue

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
finished off the way that do not glue

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:53.180 
finished off the way that do not glue
say<00:00:42.540> to<00:00:42.600> finish<00:00:42.960> them

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.779 

okay<00:00:54.090> um<00:00:54.680> the<00:00:55.680> next<00:00:55.920> one<00:00:56.039> would<00:00:56.129> obviously<00:00:56.399> be

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
okay um the next one would obviously be

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:00.770 
okay um the next one would obviously be
circle<00:00:57.690> which<00:00:57.930> where<00:00:58.289> did<00:00:58.410> it<00:00:58.500> go<00:00:59.010> oh<00:00:59.719> here<00:01:00.719> it

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
circle which where did it go oh here it

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.319 
circle which where did it go oh here it
is<00:01:00.839> okay<00:01:01.199> um<00:01:02.100> you<00:01:02.370> can<00:01:02.489> just<00:01:02.610> see<00:01:02.730> how<00:01:02.850> it<00:01:02.879> spins

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
is okay um you can just see how it spins

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:07.340 
is okay um you can just see how it spins
around<00:01:03.480> on<00:01:04.229> its<00:01:04.650> axis<00:01:04.909> and<00:01:05.909> then<00:01:06.030> it<00:01:06.119> turns<00:01:06.390> um

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
around on its axis and then it turns um

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.560 
around on its axis and then it turns um
you<00:01:08.310> know<00:01:08.400> right<00:01:08.729> here<00:01:09.180> and<00:01:09.560> here<00:01:10.560> um

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:11.570 
you know right here and here um

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:13.940 
you know right here and here um
basically<00:01:12.570> it's<00:01:12.899> what<00:01:13.049> i<00:01:13.080> did<00:01:13.290> is<00:01:13.470> i<00:01:13.619> just<00:01:13.649> did

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
basically it's what i did is i just did

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.859 
basically it's what i did is i just did
the<00:01:14.070> circle<00:01:14.369> stitch<00:01:14.580> a<00:01:14.670> few<00:01:14.850> times<00:01:15.000> um<00:01:15.420> and

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
the circle stitch a few times um and

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.660 
the circle stitch a few times um and
then<00:01:16.259> put<00:01:16.590> a<00:01:16.619> square<00:01:16.830> stitch<00:01:17.159> in<00:01:17.369> and<00:01:17.580> then

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
then put a square stitch in and then

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.420 
then put a square stitch in and then
went<00:01:18.060> back<00:01:18.090> to<00:01:18.240> doing<00:01:18.540> circle<00:01:18.930> so<00:01:19.470> it<00:01:19.920> just

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
went back to doing circle so it just

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.980 
went back to doing circle so it just
turns<00:01:20.970> the<00:01:21.270> circle<00:01:21.600> back<00:01:21.810> on<00:01:22.110> a<00:01:22.470> different<00:01:22.830> way

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:23.990 
turns the circle back on a different way

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:30.950 
turns the circle back on a different way
okay<00:01:25.190> um<00:01:26.190> next<00:01:27.119> is<00:01:27.530> twist<00:01:29.390> this<00:01:30.390> is<00:01:30.600> made<00:01:30.780> from

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
okay um next is twist this is made from

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.020 
okay um next is twist this is made from
brick<00:01:31.319> and<00:01:31.649> it's<00:01:32.039> like<00:01:32.159> the<00:01:32.310> circle<00:01:32.640> version

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
brick and it's like the circle version

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.200 
brick and it's like the circle version
of<00:01:33.119> brick<00:01:33.740> this<00:01:34.740> one<00:01:34.979> I<00:01:35.009> also<00:01:35.250> do<00:01:35.490> not<00:01:35.610> make<00:01:35.909> i

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
of brick this one I also do not make i

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.450 
of brick this one I also do not make i
found<00:01:36.630> this<00:01:36.840> somewhere<00:01:37.289> I've<00:01:37.710> never<00:01:37.770> really

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
found this somewhere I've never really

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.630 
found this somewhere I've never really
made<00:01:38.610> this<00:01:38.880> on<00:01:39.119> its<00:01:39.300> own<00:01:39.479> um<00:01:39.899> and<00:01:40.380> you'll<00:01:41.310> see

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
made this on its own um and you'll see

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.450 
made this on its own um and you'll see
why<00:01:41.789> in<00:01:42.090> a<00:01:42.330> couple<00:01:42.569> of<00:01:42.630> videos<00:01:42.929> um<00:01:43.259> I<00:01:43.560> discussed

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
why in a couple of videos um I discussed

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.160 
why in a couple of videos um I discussed
like<00:01:44.670> why<00:01:44.880> don't<00:01:44.970> ever<00:01:45.420> really<00:01:45.690> make<00:01:45.899> them<00:01:46.050> on

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
like why don't ever really make them on

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.779 
like why don't ever really make them on
my<00:01:46.289> own<00:01:47.090> that<00:01:48.090> sounds<00:01:48.420> kind<00:01:48.569> of<00:01:48.600> weird<00:01:48.659> but

00:01:49.779 --> 00:01:49.789 
my own that sounds kind of weird but

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:54.200 
my own that sounds kind of weird but
yeah<00:01:51.259> so<00:01:52.259> this<00:01:52.350> is<00:01:52.409> twist<00:01:53.009> it's<00:01:53.819> just<00:01:54.000> three

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
yeah so this is twist it's just three

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.619 
yeah so this is twist it's just three
colors<00:01:54.509> it's<00:01:54.750> very<00:01:55.020> simple<00:01:55.350> it's<00:01:55.679> um<00:01:56.009> it's<00:01:56.629> you

00:01:57.619 --> 00:01:57.629 
colors it's very simple it's um it's you

00:01:57.629 --> 00:01:59.180 
colors it's very simple it's um it's you
know<00:01:57.720> I<00:01:57.929> think<00:01:58.110> it's<00:01:58.200> a<00:01:58.289> second<00:01:58.619> simplest<00:01:59.039> i

00:01:59.180 --> 00:01:59.190 
know I think it's a second simplest i

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:01.790 
know I think it's a second simplest i
think<00:01:59.759> that<00:02:00.030> the<00:02:00.509> straight<00:02:00.899> stitches<00:02:01.470> aren't

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:01.800 
think that the straight stitches aren't

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:04.639 
think that the straight stitches aren't
as<00:02:02.069> simple<00:02:02.250> as<00:02:02.610> the<00:02:02.940> curve<00:02:03.149> stitches<00:02:03.750> I'm<00:02:03.989> just

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
as simple as the curve stitches I'm just

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:07.609 
as simple as the curve stitches I'm just
because<00:02:05.300> there's<00:02:06.300> less<00:02:06.450> involved<00:02:07.110> and<00:02:07.319> making

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
because there's less involved and making

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:09.260 
because there's less involved and making
the<00:02:07.739> curved<00:02:07.979> ones<00:02:08.280> you<00:02:08.700> not<00:02:08.819> just<00:02:09.000> think<00:02:09.179> as

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
the curved ones you not just think as

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:10.400 
the curved ones you not just think as
much<00:02:09.300> when<00:02:09.629> you're<00:02:09.720> doing<00:02:09.989> it<00:02:10.110> you<00:02:10.229> can<00:02:10.379> just

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
much when you're doing it you can just

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:11.960 
much when you're doing it you can just

kind of you know Oh diagonal diagonal

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:23.150 
kind of you know Oh diagonal diagonal
diagonal

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:29.540 

okay<00:02:24.120> um<00:02:24.750> let's<00:02:25.560> see<00:02:26.220> what<00:02:26.430> comes<00:02:26.790> next<00:02:28.550> okay

okay um let's see what comes next okay

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:33.830 
okay um let's see what comes next okay
well<00:02:29.730> this<00:02:29.850> one<00:02:30.030> is<00:02:30.240> a<00:02:30.600> circle<00:02:31.110> with<00:02:32.690> beads<00:02:33.690> in

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
well this one is a circle with beads in

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.540 
well this one is a circle with beads in
it<00:02:33.930> I<00:02:34.050> did<00:02:34.200> make<00:02:34.350> this<00:02:34.470> one<00:02:34.680> I<00:02:34.830> tried<00:02:35.130> to<00:02:35.280> end<00:02:35.430> it

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:35.550 
it I did make this one I tried to end it

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:38.000 
it I did make this one I tried to end it
this<00:02:36.150> um<00:02:36.540> if<00:02:37.140> you<00:02:37.290> don't<00:02:37.440> pull<00:02:37.680> them<00:02:37.830> tight

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
this um if you don't pull them tight

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:39.800 
this um if you don't pull them tight
enough<00:02:38.250> and<00:02:38.460> let<00:02:38.910> them<00:02:39.060> sit<00:02:39.330> before<00:02:39.480> we<00:02:39.660> cut

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
enough and let them sit before we cut

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:41.900 
enough and let them sit before we cut
the<00:02:39.900> ends<00:02:40.230> you<00:02:40.380> will<00:02:40.470> get<00:02:40.620> this<00:02:41.010> this<00:02:41.490> happens

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
the ends you will get this this happens

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:45.560 
the ends you will get this this happens
and<00:02:42.090> it's<00:02:42.240> not<00:02:42.510> cool<00:02:42.840> I<00:02:43.740> just<00:02:44.430> put<00:02:44.670> some<00:02:44.820> small

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:45.570 
and it's not cool I just put some small

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:47.540 
and it's not cool I just put some small
pony<00:02:45.870> beads<00:02:46.170> into<00:02:46.350> here<00:02:46.530> large<00:02:47.040> pony<00:02:47.280> beads

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:47.550 
pony beads into here large pony beads

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:49.730 
pony beads into here large pony beads
are<00:02:48.150> larger<00:02:48.570> than<00:02:48.660> this<00:02:48.900> and<00:02:49.170> I<00:02:49.470> didn't<00:02:49.680> like

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:49.740 
are larger than this and I didn't like

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:50.900 
are larger than this and I didn't like
the<00:02:49.860> way<00:02:49.920> that<00:02:50.040> lip<00:02:50.220> so<00:02:50.400> i<00:02:50.460> bought<00:02:50.610> the<00:02:50.700> small

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:50.910 
the way that lip so i bought the small

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:53.450 
the way that lip so i bought the small
kind<00:02:51.120> to<00:02:51.180> put<00:02:51.330> them<00:02:51.420> in<00:02:51.480> um<00:02:52.260> yeah<00:02:53.070> I<00:02:53.220> could<00:02:53.370> show

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:53.460 
kind to put them in um yeah I could show

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:55.340 
kind to put them in um yeah I could show
you<00:02:53.490> how<00:02:53.580> to<00:02:53.670> do<00:02:53.760> this<00:02:53.940> to<00:02:54.240> this<00:02:54.540> is<00:02:54.750> kind<00:02:55.260> of

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:55.350 
you how to do this to this is kind of

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:57.500 
you how to do this to this is kind of
complicated<00:02:55.530> to<00:02:55.980> do<00:02:56.100> because<00:02:56.550> if<00:02:57.210> you're<00:02:57.480> not

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
complicated to do because if you're not

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:00.110 
complicated to do because if you're not
pulling<00:02:57.900> right<00:02:58.380> the<00:02:58.980> bee<00:02:59.160> pops<00:02:59.370> out<00:02:59.550> and<00:02:59.760> it

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
pulling right the bee pops out and it

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:10.979 
pulling right the bee pops out and it
Nestle's<00:03:00.510> up

00:03:10.979 --> 00:03:10.989 

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:14.589 

okay<00:03:11.989> um<00:03:12.230> now<00:03:12.890> this<00:03:13.010> is<00:03:13.069> triangle<00:03:13.640> and<00:03:13.909> you

00:03:14.589 --> 00:03:14.599 
okay um now this is triangle and you

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:16.119 
okay um now this is triangle and you
can't<00:03:14.840> see<00:03:15.170> the<00:03:15.349> actual<00:03:15.530> triangle<00:03:15.950> stitch

00:03:16.119 --> 00:03:16.129 
can't see the actual triangle stitch

00:03:16.129 --> 00:03:17.470 
can't see the actual triangle stitch
look<00:03:16.340> lik<00:03:16.489> because<00:03:16.760> I<00:03:16.879> do<00:03:16.939> have<00:03:17.060> it<00:03:17.299> finished

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:17.480 
look lik because I do have it finished

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:23.140 
look lik because I do have it finished
on<00:03:17.780> both<00:03:17.930> ends<00:03:19.209> but<00:03:20.829> basically<00:03:21.829> I<00:03:22.159> don't<00:03:23.060> know

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:23.150 
on both ends but basically I don't know

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:24.550 
on both ends but basically I don't know
if<00:03:23.239> you<00:03:23.329> can<00:03:23.420> you<00:03:23.540> until<00:03:23.840> there's<00:03:24.109> three<00:03:24.379> sides

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:24.560 
if you can you until there's three sides

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:28.330 
if you can you until there's three sides
to<00:03:24.829> this<00:03:25.209> um<00:03:26.209> you<00:03:26.299> know<00:03:26.930> here's<00:03:27.500> one<00:03:27.709> side<00:03:28.040> to

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:28.340 
to this um you know here's one side to

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:32.020 
to this um you know here's one side to
side<00:03:29.090> three<00:03:29.870> side<00:03:30.139> here<00:03:30.680> it<00:03:30.859> is<00:03:31.400> what<00:03:31.579> it<00:03:31.609> is<00:03:31.700> it

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:32.030 
side three side here it is what it is it

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:33.610 
side three side here it is what it is it
is<00:03:32.150> a<00:03:32.180> triangle<00:03:32.510> you<00:03:32.840> only<00:03:33.019> have<00:03:33.290> three

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:33.620 
is a triangle you only have three

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:35.500 
is a triangle you only have three
strands<00:03:34.040> to<00:03:34.310> it<00:03:34.430> um<00:03:34.609> it<00:03:35.120> is<00:03:35.269> a<00:03:35.299> lot<00:03:35.389> more

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:35.510 
strands to it um it is a lot more

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:37.629 
strands to it um it is a lot more
complicated<00:03:35.840> because<00:03:36.620> of<00:03:37.010> the<00:03:37.099> way<00:03:37.250> you<00:03:37.310> are

00:03:37.629 --> 00:03:37.639 
complicated because of the way you are

00:03:37.639 --> 00:03:39.670 
complicated because of the way you are
pulling<00:03:38.030> the<00:03:38.659> strands<00:03:39.169> you're<00:03:39.290> not<00:03:39.409> pulling

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:39.680 
pulling the strands you're not pulling

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:41.679 
pulling the strands you're not pulling
them<00:03:40.010> on<00:03:40.249> you<00:03:40.879> know<00:03:40.909> one<00:03:41.239> in<00:03:41.329> each<00:03:41.389> direction

00:03:41.679 --> 00:03:41.689 
them on you know one in each direction

00:03:41.689 --> 00:03:44.050 
them on you know one in each direction
you're<00:03:42.049> kind<00:03:42.260> of<00:03:42.319> three<00:03:43.280> strand<00:03:43.579> pulling<00:03:43.939> it

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:44.060 
you're kind of three strand pulling it

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:48.220 
you're kind of three strand pulling it
so<00:03:44.450> it's<00:03:45.019> kind<00:03:45.290> of<00:03:45.379> difficult<00:03:46.599> that<00:03:47.599> one<00:03:47.870> I

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:48.230 
so it's kind of difficult that one I

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:50.709 
so it's kind of difficult that one I
don't<00:03:48.739> think<00:03:48.769> I<00:03:48.980> learned<00:03:49.159> to<00:03:49.280> do<00:03:49.430> for<00:03:49.939> tells

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:50.719 
don't think I learned to do for tells

00:03:50.719 --> 00:04:01.110 
don't think I learned to do for tells
probably<00:03:51.019> 12

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:01.120 

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:03.210 

okay<00:04:01.930> now<00:04:02.080> this<00:04:02.290> one<00:04:02.500> it<00:04:02.680> just<00:04:02.739> looks<00:04:03.040> really

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:03.220 
okay now this one it just looks really

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:05.759 
okay now this one it just looks really
dumb<00:04:03.580> and<00:04:03.849> I<00:04:03.940> don't<00:04:03.970> know<00:04:04.239> why<00:04:04.450> this<00:04:05.110> is<00:04:05.170> zipper

00:04:05.759 --> 00:04:05.769 
dumb and I don't know why this is zipper

00:04:05.769 --> 00:04:08.220 
dumb and I don't know why this is zipper
it's<00:04:06.670> the<00:04:06.849> doubles<00:04:07.180> up<00:04:07.330> the<00:04:07.569> regular<00:04:07.690> zipper

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:08.230 
it's the doubles up the regular zipper

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:11.309 
it's the doubles up the regular zipper
and<00:04:08.379> then<00:04:08.890> I<00:04:08.920> have<00:04:09.159> some<00:04:10.080> triangle<00:04:11.080> on<00:04:11.140> the<00:04:11.170> end

00:04:11.309 --> 00:04:11.319 
and then I have some triangle on the end

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:12.899 
and then I have some triangle on the end
I<00:04:11.440> think<00:04:11.470> what<00:04:11.890> I<00:04:11.950> was<00:04:12.040> trying<00:04:12.280> to<00:04:12.400> do<00:04:12.519> what<00:04:12.879> I

00:04:12.899 --> 00:04:12.909 
I think what I was trying to do what I

00:04:12.909 --> 00:04:16.590 
I think what I was trying to do what I
was<00:04:13.120> trying<00:04:13.620> to<00:04:14.620> make<00:04:15.310> a<00:04:15.519> lot<00:04:15.730> of<00:04:16.000> boondoggle

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:16.600 
was trying to make a lot of boondoggle

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:19.080 
was trying to make a lot of boondoggle
to<00:04:17.109> fill<00:04:17.260> up<00:04:17.410> my<00:04:17.440> bag<00:04:17.739> because<00:04:18.370> I<00:04:18.549> do<00:04:18.609> keep<00:04:18.910> them

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:19.090 
to fill up my bag because I do keep them

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:24.360 
to fill up my bag because I do keep them
in<00:04:19.299> a<00:04:19.930> tues<00:04:20.709> juicy<00:04:21.040> bag<00:04:21.190> surprise<00:04:21.639> um<00:04:22.979> but<00:04:23.979> it

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:24.370

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:26.580 
in a tues juicy bag surprise um but it
didn't<00:04:25.180> really<00:04:25.330> help<00:04:25.630> I<00:04:25.870> don't<00:04:26.080> know<00:04:26.169> they

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:26.590 
didn't really help I don't know they

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:29.070 
didn't really help I don't know they
just<00:04:26.620> it<00:04:27.250> didn't<00:04:27.910> it<00:04:28.090> doesn't<00:04:28.419> look<00:04:28.479> good<00:04:28.780> I

normally when you make butterfly you
only<00:05:18.039> have<00:05:18.190> two<00:05:18.370> strands<00:05:18.700> and<00:05:18.880> this<00:05:19.090> one<00:05:19.270> is

brick so you have three strands you know

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:51.480 
brick so you have three strands you know
going<00:05:48.460> across<00:05:48.729> and<00:05:49.139> then<00:05:50.139> you<00:05:50.470> have<00:05:50.650> one<00:05:50.979> the

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:54.160 
other way and it's just like the circle

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:58.620 
other way and it's just like the circle
version<00:05:54.490> of<00:05:55.300> super<00:05:55.660> bright<00:05:56.520> it<00:05:57.520> is<00:05:57.580> super<00:05:58.090> the

00:05:58.620 --> 00:05:58.630 
version of super bright it is super the

00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:00.990 
version of super bright it is super the
circle<00:05:58.900> version<00:05:59.169> of<00:05:59.229> super<00:05:59.530> brick<00:05:59.710> and<00:05:59.919> it<00:06:00.789> is

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:01.000 
circle version of super brick and it is

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.750

00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:30.160 
look like when they are finished in

00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:32.940 
look like when they are finished in
there<00:07:30.340> longer<00:07:30.840> because<00:07:31.840> I<00:07:32.170> know<00:07:32.320> that<00:07:32.680> for<00:07:32.890> the

00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:32.950 
there longer because I know that for the

00:07:32.950 --> 00:07:34.770 
there longer because I know that for the
circle<00:07:33.340> in<00:07:33.430> the<00:07:33.490> square<00:07:33.700> I<00:07:34.000> didn't<00:07:34.330> really<00:07:34.450> do

00:07:34.770 --> 00:07:34.780 
circle in the square I didn't really do

00:07:34.780 --> 00:07:37.410 
circle in the square I didn't really do
um<00:07:35.050> you<00:07:35.920> know<00:07:36.010> a<00:07:36.190> long<00:07:36.460> length<00:07:36.790> I<00:07:37.060> basically

00:07:37.410 --> 00:07:37.420 
um you know a long length I basically

00:07:37.420 --> 00:07:40.710 
um you know a long length I basically
did<00:07:37.810> that<00:07:38.350> much<00:07:38.620> and<00:07:39.070> I<00:07:39.760> know<00:07:39.790> that<00:07:40.150> sometimes

00:07:40.710 --> 00:07:40.720 
did that much and I know that sometimes

00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:42.120 
did that much and I know that sometimes
it's<00:07:41.050> hard<00:07:41.230> to<00:07:41.290> tell<00:07:41.380> what<00:07:41.650> it<00:07:41.710> looks<00:07:41.920> like

00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:42.130 
it's hard to tell what it looks like
