00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
I'm using a headset microphone in this

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:06.230 
I'm using a headset microphone in this
case<00:01:01.559> it's<00:01:01.829> the<00:01:02.090> andrea<00:01:03.090> NZ<00:01:04.040> 61<00:01:05.040> now<00:01:05.970> what's

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
nice about this is that while it has

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.289 
nice about this is that while it has
analog<00:01:09.240> plugs<00:01:09.720> it<00:01:10.049> did<00:01:10.439> come<00:01:10.680> with<00:01:10.890> the<00:01:11.040> USB

00:01:11.289 --> 00:01:11.299 
analog plugs it did come with the USB

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:13.850 
analog plugs it did come with the USB
adapter<00:01:12.299> and<00:01:12.689> this<00:01:12.960> is<00:01:13.140> a<00:01:13.170> slightly<00:01:13.560> older

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
adapter and this is a slightly older

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.910 
adapter and this is a slightly older
headset<00:01:14.810> most<00:01:15.810> of<00:01:15.990> the<00:01:16.080> headsets<00:01:16.560> that<00:01:16.680> your

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
headset most of the headsets that your

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.100 
headset most of the headsets that your
find<00:01:17.250> today<00:01:17.820> are<00:01:18.090> USB<00:01:18.960> and<00:01:19.560> you<00:01:19.979> really<00:01:20.490> want<00:01:20.790> a

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:21.110 
find today are USB and you really want a

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:25.429 
find today are USB and you really want a
USB<00:01:22.250> headset<00:01:23.250> now<00:01:23.780> one<00:01:24.780> of<00:01:24.810> the<00:01:25.020> things<00:01:25.049> you'll

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
USB headset now one of the things you'll

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:28.249 
USB headset now one of the things you'll
notice<00:01:25.650> about<00:01:25.950> this<00:01:26.430> is<00:01:26.700> that<00:01:27.060> while<00:01:28.020> it's

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
notice about this is that while it's

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.410 
notice about this is that while it's
great<00:01:28.619> that<00:01:28.829> the<00:01:28.979> microphone<00:01:29.579> is<00:01:29.610> positioned

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
great that the microphone is positioned

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.890 
great that the microphone is positioned
a<00:01:30.689> set<00:01:31.350> distance<00:01:31.619> from<00:01:32.159> your<00:01:32.310> mouth<00:01:32.900> sometimes

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
a set distance from your mouth sometimes

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.800 
a set distance from your mouth sometimes
it's<00:01:34.229> too<00:01:34.799> close<00:01:35.100> so<00:01:35.729> one<00:01:36.329> of<00:01:36.360> the<00:01:36.570> drawbacks

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
it's too close so one of the drawbacks

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.340 
it's too close so one of the drawbacks
to<00:01:37.350> headsets<00:01:37.860> as<00:01:38.159> well<00:01:38.990> sometimes<00:01:39.990> you<00:01:40.170> might

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
to headsets as well sometimes you might

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.399 
to headsets as well sometimes you might
hear<00:01:40.650> people<00:01:41.070> breathe<00:01:41.579> and<00:01:42.030> and<00:01:42.570> so<00:01:42.960> we<00:01:43.229> don't

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
hear people breathe and and so we don't

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:44.990 
hear people breathe and and so we don't
want<00:01:43.590> to<00:01:43.680> hear<00:01:43.829> that<00:01:43.890> we<00:01:44.220> don't<00:01:44.460> want<00:01:44.759> to<00:01:44.850> hear

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
want to hear that we don't want to hear

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.550 
want to hear that we don't want to hear

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.200 
to use a USB adapter so the adapter that
I<00:02:25.200> have<00:02:25.440> for<00:02:25.650> the<00:02:25.770> headset<00:02:26.250> I'm<00:02:26.460> using<00:02:26.700> for<00:02:27.090> the

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:27.210 
I have for the headset I'm using for the

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:30.080 
I have for the headset I'm using for the
lapel<00:02:27.570> mic<00:02:27.840> as<00:02:28.080> well<00:02:28.460> but<00:02:29.460> I<00:02:29.520> think<00:02:29.610> you'll

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
lapel mic as well but I think you'll

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:32.240 
lapel mic as well but I think you'll
hear<00:02:30.450> that<00:02:30.660> the<00:02:30.810> audio<00:02:31.290> quality<00:02:31.350> is<00:02:31.980> really

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
hear that the audio quality is really

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:35.780 
hear that the audio quality is really
pretty<00:02:32.820> good<00:02:33.560> one<00:02:34.560> other<00:02:34.770> drawback<00:02:35.370> to<00:02:35.400> this

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
pretty good one other drawback to this

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:39.890 
pretty good one other drawback to this
device<00:02:36.210> is<00:02:36.450> that<00:02:36.900> it's<00:02:37.080> a<00:02:37.230> mono<00:02:37.860> output<00:02:38.700> so<00:02:39.570> I

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
device is that it's a mono output so I

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:43.970 
device is that it's a mono output so I
actually<00:02:40.440> had<00:02:40.950> to<00:02:40.980> get<00:02:41.310> a<00:02:41.720> stereo<00:02:42.720> adapter<00:02:43.050> at

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
actually had to get a stereo adapter at

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.910 
actually had to get a stereo adapter at
Radio<00:02:44.610> Shack<00:02:44.700> so<00:02:45.600> I<00:02:45.630> could<00:02:45.990> use<00:02:46.260> this<00:02:46.500> and<00:02:46.800> that

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
Radio Shack so I could use this and that

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.220 
Radio Shack so I could use this and that
will<00:02:47.040> convert<00:02:47.400> the<00:02:47.610> signal<00:02:48.030> to<00:02:48.240> a<00:02:48.270> stereo

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
will convert the signal to a stereo

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:53.090 
will convert the signal to a stereo
