00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:12.469
 hello finally we looked out 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:16.410
 the sun though it was very cold at night 

00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:18.600
 by spring standards it's very cold for now 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:22.020
 the sun looked out I want to take off immediately 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:27.539
 several and overlays show you 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:30.449
 which have been made lately these 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:33.510
 lining made for four different 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:35.219
 I will not call people today 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.550
 I want to quickly show because 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:40.200
 Now apparently here's the sun will run away 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:43.230
 carbon carbon carbon need to show when 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:47.550
 there is sunshine we will be mine 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:49.890
 barrage 581 with stalin 390 and on him 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:54.690
 Two sets were made for different 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:56.550
 people dink I usually used to put on 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.670
 we showed under the connector show 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:02.190
 lining without a knife 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:04.699
 because they are basically their 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:07.969
 the structure is very similar 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:11.180
 only one small nuance here was 

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:13.960
 done processing so let's say 3d 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:16.880
 but actually it's just like that 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:18.920
 rounded hilt effect 3d 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:21.439
 achieved by the fact that the depth 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:24.350
 the material seems to be not visually 

00:01:21.439 --> 00:01:26.049
 Because of this, I understand that 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:32.539
 called 3d 

00:01:26.049 --> 00:01:35.119
 looks very gorgeous cool then 

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:37.189
 a spacer was finally made here i 

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:40.310
 Found the name of this material is 

00:01:37.189 --> 00:01:42.500
 turns out to be the most durable composite in 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:46.069
 the world at the moment it is stronger than 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:49.759
 carbon pancake because I forgot what it's called 

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:51.709
 but never mind, I still thought why he 

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:54.489
 harder even cut than carbon 

00:01:51.709 --> 00:01:59.409
 now from java it found out this moment 

00:01:54.489 --> 00:02:00.649
 here were made on the lining 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:04.970
 glued 

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:08.660
 so to say spacers liners from 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:11.660
 red thin g10 that gives more 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:15.380
 more interesting look than just 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:18.319
 carbon lining and neatly everything 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:23.389
 processed along the contour looks very 

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:27.489
 cool exactly the same lining 

00:02:23.389 --> 00:02:31.970
 very similar to its processing yes it seems 

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:35.959
 were made for the same knife but for 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:39.850
 I want to show another customer 

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:44.540
 here I was glued to blue 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:46.069
 liner spacer liner blue liner of 10 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:49.430
 ten 

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:52.430
 but that looks thicker too 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:54.859
 cool blue color and carbon 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:58.939
 Looks great in my opinion on 

00:02:54.859 --> 00:03:01.930
 clicking will look even better these 

00:02:58.939 --> 00:03:07.040
 nladochki leave us in Kyrgyzstan 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:10.370
 danila yeti hello to you but they are cozy 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:12.980
 immediately there will be another knife made from exactly 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:15.049
 another lining for another knife 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:18.260
 there too it will be interesting to them 

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:20.450
 nations of materials show read not 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:22.700
 will and 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:26.000
 Do you have before him to do this 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:31.699
 Here is a spacer from the same material 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:36.889
 very durable this damn forgot how 

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:39.560
 called on one site just saw 

00:03:36.889 --> 00:03:44.030
 this material and there was given a description 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:46.250
 it is here and so looks 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:50.470
 lining for those who did not order from me 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:53.629
 work so here they come to the customer 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:58.040
 I want to show just as long as there is 

00:03:53.629 --> 00:04:02.359
 uses case so here it looks 

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:04.389
 processing inside all for the Chike all 

00:04:02.359 --> 00:04:08.780
 everything is done clearly 

00:04:04.389 --> 00:04:11.329
 here too spring by the screw 

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:14.479
 adjusting axial also all 

00:04:11.329 --> 00:04:17.709
 necessary technical holes 

00:04:14.479 --> 00:04:17.709
 made too 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:27.020
 so here is another knife from 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:28.030
 carbon fiber until light escaped show it 

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:33.110
 also 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:34.150
 This knife is made for if I am mistaken romance 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:37.130
 yes romance 

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:42.500
 name is customer lives in st. petersburg 

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:43.310
 we have it that strider sng is very cool 

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:45.090
 looks 

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:47.340
 interesting 

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:50.699
 the work is almost finished the only 

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:54.380
 the novel asked me to make a sharper one 

00:04:50.699 --> 00:04:56.699
 sharpening angle to make the knife easier to cut 

00:04:54.380 --> 00:05:00.870
 the cogs here were very shabby 

00:04:56.699 --> 00:05:04.500
 so now I will try to show if 

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:06.710
 the camera will catch i did the heat treatment and 

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:09.720
 now they are so purple and blue 

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:12.030
 golden shimmer 

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:14.040
 also did heat treatment on everyone 

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:19.500
 the remaining screws that are on 

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:22.050
 jars here i'm here too just 

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:27.240
 carbon here put it already 

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:32.160
 red liner looks to my 

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:35.970
 look very cool just carbon 

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:38.400
 it looks boring in my opinion here 

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:40.039
 This red liner does not sell 

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:43.490
 what kind of aggression 

00:05:40.039 --> 00:05:49.370
 maybe even a little bit of some kind 

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:49.370
 Carbon Fudge Looks Very Cool 

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:57.620
 honestly the sun plays all the most 

00:05:53.520 --> 00:06:01.410
 the fibers are very cool stuff 

00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:04.490
 the knife looks very harsh thanks 

00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:07.010
 to the fact that he is still drawing made 

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:13.979
 this is kevin john ovsky 

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:16.680
 through the trader and another knife one more 

00:06:13.979 --> 00:06:19.560
 night job this is my knife was done 

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:26.099
 still used black used here 

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:29.000
 g10 reptilian processing now i like 

00:06:26.099 --> 00:06:32.610
 always made a new spacer this time 

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:34.889
 such a proprietor applied the drawing but you 

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:36.930
 decided to try 

00:06:34.889 --> 00:06:40.099
 the look was interesting but the most 

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:45.659
 the main thing that the customer liked 

00:06:40.099 --> 00:06:49.229
 mechanics all as usual approved by 

00:06:45.659 --> 00:06:49.860
 the request of the customer on the barge assist was 

00:06:49.229 --> 00:06:52.499
 left 

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:54.599
 although if I have such a knife and 

00:06:52.499 --> 00:06:58.639
 my sister will definitely take off the knife without him 

00:06:54.599 --> 00:07:03.979
 just here it flies very nicely 

00:06:58.639 --> 00:07:03.979
 Here is such a composition 

00:07:05.389 --> 00:07:11.180
 Thank you all for your attention and to the new ones 

00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:11.180
 meetings yet
