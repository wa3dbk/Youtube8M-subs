00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
different kinds of texture to the glass

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:57.799 
different kinds of texture to the glass
I<00:00:56.699> mean<00:00:56.850> you<00:00:57.030> might<00:00:57.149> not<00:00:57.270> be<00:00:57.390> able<00:00:57.420> to<00:00:57.600> see<00:00:57.690> this

transparent<00:01:39.000> glass<00:01:39.200> but<00:01:40.200> you<00:01:40.770> know<00:01:40.860> they<00:01:41.040> can

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
transparent glass but you know they can

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.520 
transparent glass but you know they can
have<00:01:41.430> any<00:01:41.850> types<00:01:42.240> of<00:01:42.390> textures<00:01:42.810> to<00:01:43.170> them<00:01:43.320> so

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
have any types of textures to them so

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.830 
have any types of textures to them so
this<00:01:43.710> is<00:01:43.829> a<00:01:43.860> type<00:01:44.100> of<00:01:44.130> cathedral<00:01:44.880> clear<00:01:45.360> that

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
this is a type of cathedral clear that

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.319 
this is a type of cathedral clear that
kind<00:01:46.020> of<00:01:46.079> has<00:01:46.229> a<00:01:46.259> streaky<00:01:46.890> bubble<00:01:47.640> texture<00:01:48.149> to

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
kind of has a streaky bubble texture to

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:53.749 
kind of has a streaky bubble texture to
it<00:01:49.280> this<00:01:51.320> let's<00:01:52.320> see<00:01:52.560> here's<00:01:53.310> kind<00:01:53.610> of<00:01:53.670> a

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
it this let's see here's kind of a

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:57.380 
it this let's see here's kind of a
cathedral<00:01:55.009> kind<00:01:56.009> of<00:01:56.100> a<00:01:56.189> yellow<00:01:56.670> amber<00:01:56.939> color

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
cathedral kind of a yellow amber color

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.030 
cathedral kind of a yellow amber color
and<00:01:57.960> I<00:01:58.020> don't<00:01:58.140> know<00:01:58.200> if<00:01:58.290> you<00:01:58.350> can<00:01:58.469> see<00:01:58.710> this<00:01:58.860> but

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
and I don't know if you can see this but

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.649 
and I don't know if you can see this but
this<00:01:59.189> kind<00:01:59.460> of<00:01:59.579> has<00:01:59.759> some<00:02:00.119> I'll<00:02:00.329> move<00:02:00.540> it

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
this kind of has some I'll move it

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.149 
this kind of has some I'll move it
around<00:02:00.719> a<00:02:00.840> little<00:02:00.869> bit<00:02:01.170> it<00:02:01.710> kind<00:02:01.950> of<00:02:01.979> has

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
around a little bit it kind of has

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.190 
around a little bit it kind of has
almost<00:02:02.460> like<00:02:02.640> these<00:02:02.790> very<00:02:02.969> fine<00:02:03.390> little<00:02:03.689> wispy

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
almost like these very fine little wispy

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.740 
almost like these very fine little wispy
kind<00:02:04.829> of<00:02:04.920> like<00:02:05.040> spiderweb<00:02:05.670> lines<00:02:06.030> in<00:02:06.270> it<00:02:06.390> right

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
kind of like spiderweb lines in it right

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.540 
kind of like spiderweb lines in it right
but<00:02:07.170> it's<00:02:07.290> a<00:02:07.380> cathedral<00:02:07.829> glass<00:02:08.039> because<00:02:08.399> it's

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
but it's a cathedral glass because it's

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.580 
but it's a cathedral glass because it's
a<00:02:08.610> transparent<00:02:09.000> glass<00:02:09.450> here's<00:02:10.319> another

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
a transparent glass here's another

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.500 
a transparent glass here's another
cathedral<00:02:11.220> glass<00:02:11.640> one<00:02:11.879> of<00:02:11.970> the<00:02:12.030> first<00:02:12.209> ones<00:02:12.390> I

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
cathedral glass one of the first ones I

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:13.410 
cathedral glass one of the first ones I
showed<00:02:12.540> you<00:02:12.900> is<00:02:13.020> a<00:02:13.050> red

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.420 
showed you is a red

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:15.720 
showed you is a red
one<00:02:13.540> but<00:02:13.780> this<00:02:13.900> has<00:02:14.050> a<00:02:14.080> very<00:02:14.440> strong<00:02:14.890> kind<00:02:15.670> of

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 
one but this has a very strong kind of

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:18.150 
one but this has a very strong kind of
ripple<00:02:15.970> texture<00:02:16.720> to<00:02:16.900> it<00:02:16.930> and<00:02:17.200> it<00:02:17.680> doesn't<00:02:18.040> only

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.160 
ripple texture to it and it doesn't only

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:19.770 
ripple texture to it and it doesn't only
change<00:02:18.520> the<00:02:18.700> way<00:02:18.790> that<00:02:18.940> light<00:02:19.180> moves<00:02:19.420> through

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
change the way that light moves through

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:21.510 
change the way that light moves through
the<00:02:19.930> glass<00:02:20.170> but<00:02:20.440> it<00:02:20.560> actually<00:02:20.739> if<00:02:21.069> you<00:02:21.160> can<00:02:21.310> see

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:21.520 
the glass but it actually if you can see

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:24.900 
the glass but it actually if you can see
has<00:02:21.849> a<00:02:21.880> real<00:02:22.270> texture<00:02:23.200> to<00:02:23.500> it<00:02:23.530> okay<00:02:23.980> so<00:02:24.790> those

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:24.910 
has a real texture to it okay so those

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:26.309 
has a real texture to it okay so those
are<00:02:25.060> Cathedral<00:02:25.510> glasses<00:02:25.989> and<00:02:26.110> then<00:02:26.200> the

00:02:26.309 --> 00:02:26.319 
are Cathedral glasses and then the

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:28.320 
are Cathedral glasses and then the
second<00:02:26.680> type<00:02:26.830> of<00:02:26.980> glass<00:02:27.160> is<00:02:27.459> what<00:02:27.640> we<00:02:27.790> call<00:02:28.060> an

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:28.330 
second type of glass is what we call an

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:30.840 
second type of glass is what we call an
opalescent<00:02:29.200> glass<00:02:29.500> and<00:02:30.069> an<00:02:30.160> opalescent<00:02:30.550> glass

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:30.850 
opalescent glass and an opalescent glass

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:34.410 
opalescent glass and an opalescent glass
is<00:02:31.330> one<00:02:31.989> that<00:02:32.170> kind<00:02:32.350> of<00:02:32.440> has<00:02:32.560> a<00:02:32.590> milky<00:02:33.220> color<00:02:34.090> to

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420 
is one that kind of has a milky color to

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:38.699 
is one that kind of has a milky color to
it<00:02:34.540> kind<00:02:34.750> of<00:02:34.810> a<00:02:34.900> swirled<00:02:35.370> milky<00:02:36.370> um<00:02:36.640> trans<00:02:37.709> will

00:02:38.699 --> 00:02:38.709 
it kind of a swirled milky um trans will

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:40.710 
it kind of a swirled milky um trans will
actually<00:02:39.069> transparent<00:02:39.940> mix<00:02:40.180> with<00:02:40.450> them

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:40.720 
actually transparent mix with them

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:42.780 
actually transparent mix with them
opaque<00:02:41.200> so<00:02:41.709> here's<00:02:41.920> an<00:02:42.040> example<00:02:42.340> of<00:02:42.640> an

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790 
opaque so here's an example of an

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:44.940 
opaque so here's an example of an
opalescent<00:02:43.150> glass<00:02:43.420> you<00:02:44.170> see<00:02:44.349> it's<00:02:44.530> got<00:02:44.709> some

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950 
opalescent glass you see it's got some

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:47.309 
opalescent glass you see it's got some
transparency<00:02:45.640> to<00:02:45.940> it<00:02:46.090> but<00:02:46.660> it<00:02:46.780> also<00:02:46.900> kind<00:02:47.260> of

00:02:47.309 --> 00:02:47.319 
transparency to it but it also kind of

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:49.410 
transparency to it but it also kind of
has<00:02:47.500> some<00:02:47.830> these<00:02:47.980> milky<00:02:48.519> streaks<00:02:48.880> in<00:02:49.090> it<00:02:49.209> and

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:49.420 
has some these milky streaks in it and

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:52.199 
has some these milky streaks in it and
oh<00:02:50.069> this<00:02:51.069> one<00:02:51.310> here<00:02:51.580> and<00:02:51.700> some<00:02:51.940> of<00:02:52.030> them<00:02:52.150> are

00:02:52.199 --> 00:02:52.209 
oh this one here and some of them are

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:53.789 
oh this one here and some of them are
kind<00:02:52.480> of<00:02:52.540> in<00:02:52.660> the<00:02:52.690> middle<00:02:52.900> I<00:02:53.110> mean<00:02:53.260> this<00:02:53.380> one<00:02:53.620> is

00:02:53.789 --> 00:02:53.799 
kind of in the middle I mean this one is

00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:56.699 
kind of in the middle I mean this one is
sort<00:02:54.790> of<00:02:54.880> kind<00:02:55.630> of<00:02:55.690> opalescent<00:02:56.110> kind<00:02:56.620> of

00:02:56.699 --> 00:02:56.709 
sort of kind of opalescent kind of

00:02:56.709 --> 00:02:58.800 
sort of kind of opalescent kind of
Cathedral<00:02:57.250> and<00:02:57.280> it's<00:02:57.519> got<00:02:57.640> some<00:02:58.120> transparent
