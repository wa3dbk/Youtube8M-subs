on<00:01:21.000> the<00:01:21.180> same<00:01:21.479> principles<00:01:22.200> that<00:01:22.320> Amway<00:01:22.770> was

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979

now<00:01:27.150> sometimes<00:01:27.720> our<00:01:28.170> young<00:01:28.470> people<00:01:28.890> today

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
now sometimes our young people today

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.310 
now sometimes our young people today
especially<00:01:29.520> thinks<00:01:30.210> that's<00:01:30.390> kind<00:01:30.720> of<00:01:30.840> unusual

especially thinks that's kind of unusual

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.490 
especially thinks that's kind of unusual
but<00:01:32.189> in<00:01:32.490> those<00:01:33.030> years<00:01:33.450> what<00:01:33.930> was<00:01:34.079> the<00:01:34.229> same

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
but in those years what was the same

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.670 
but in those years what was the same
year<00:01:34.920> that<00:01:35.130> Fidel<00:01:35.939> Castro<00:01:36.479> took<00:01:36.540> over<00:01:36.869> in<00:01:37.200> Cuba

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
and the word in our country at that time

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.670 
and the word in our country at that time
was<00:01:41.579> that<00:01:41.610> capitalism<00:01:42.570> was<00:01:42.750> dead<00:01:43.049> and<00:01:43.439> free

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
was that capitalism was dead and free

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
enterprise was over and the age of

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.819 
enterprise was over and the age of
socialism<00:01:46.409> was<00:01:46.740> here<00:01:47.100> and<00:01:48.110> God<00:01:49.110> was<00:01:49.320> dead<00:01:49.560> too

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
socialism was here and God was dead too

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:54.350 
socialism was here and God was dead too
and<00:01:50.960> it<00:01:51.960> was<00:01:52.049> in<00:01:52.259> that<00:01:52.470> atmosphere<00:01:52.799> that<00:01:53.670> we

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
and it was in that atmosphere that we

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.420 
and it was in that atmosphere that we
formed<00:01:54.780> Amway<00:01:55.229> and<00:01:55.610> Arthur<00:01:56.610> and<00:01:56.759> Gary<00:01:57.000> formed

00:01:58.420 --> 00:01:58.430

Northwood University and so sometimes

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:04.359 
Northwood University and so sometimes

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
the strength of its based on capitalism

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.699 
the strength of its based on capitalism
but<00:02:07.890> we<00:02:08.220> were<00:02:08.399> fighting<00:02:08.970> at<00:02:09.179> that<00:02:09.420> time<00:02:09.780> to

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
but we were fighting at that time to

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:12.470 
but we were fighting at that time to
make<00:02:10.739> sure<00:02:10.920> that<00:02:11.370> in<00:02:11.520> this<00:02:11.730> country<00:02:12.270> those
