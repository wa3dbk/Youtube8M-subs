00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:35.280
 monthly and each volume costs 12 90 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:37.380
 I find it attractive and stands out in 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.850
 means to other sleeves by owning colors 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.739
 strong and simple 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.680
 the work was originally released in 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:45.989

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.390

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:51.360
 main competitor of dian piauÃ­

 works like iron and have its author 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:59.370
 flame on suzuki cover on history 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.079
 she is one of the medieval enough 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.539
 inspired by the stories of King Arthur and 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:05.580
 the knights of the English roundtable 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:07.890
 so much so that the name of the region is Britannia 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.720
 receive nelly yes means the seven 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.130
 deadly sins and in manga 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.229
 represented by a group of seven 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.630
 knights who fell apart because 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:18.990
 allegedly conspire to overthrow the 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:21.000
 lion llyods kingdom at last 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.070
 at the time some paladins who are 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.390
 Kingdom warriors got their fame 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.009
 of saviors 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.869
 however, it appears that they 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:29.509
 manipulated the facts and the very 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:30.990
 paladins who are the real 

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:33.180
 traitors 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.250
 so much that ten years later when it starts 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.259
 the timeline of the story is rumored 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.689
 that the Paladins are planning a coup 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:41.670
 state to overthrow the king and become 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:43.829
 tyrannical rulers 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:46.530
 to avoid this one of the king's daughters to 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:48.360
 princess elizabeth following the rumors of 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.850
 that the seven deadly sins were 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:53.399
 living out looking for them to avoid 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.829
 of the paladins and that is how they 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:57.540
 she knows girls the protagonist of 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:02:00.000
 history and joins the princess in 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:01.680
 search for his former companions and 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.960
 so we can go to my 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.579
 first impressions of fact as soon as 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.649
 I started reading I came across a 

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:09.179
 very beautiful and original art 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:11.370
 although the author has a style that 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:12.650
 reminds of akira toriyama the first 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:14.780
 chapter is very intense 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:17.750
 well presented with a crying face in two 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:19.310
 Legal good mags twitter short of 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:21.769
 seven deadly sins has a rhythm 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:23.930
 absurdly good and involved in such a way 

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:26.329
 which reminded me of the best lines 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:28.670
 best recent shonen readings want 

00:02:26.329 --> 00:02:30.799
 to keep up with the good shows is like 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:33.470
 before I did but it is very difficult to buy 

00:02:30.799 --> 00:02:36.470
 This long manga has no money to 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:38.810
 not too long too sadly 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:41.090
 about the period in which the protagonist 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:44.090
 he has one wants to have design that pleases me 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:46.370
 enough and is extremely powerful one 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:48.440
 thing that can be criticized is that 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:49.790
 constantly abused princess picking up 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:52.129
 on your breasts etc. 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:54.139
 and she does not react at all I know it's 

00:02:52.129 --> 00:02:55.639
 a joke I know it's a fan service for 

00:02:54.139 --> 00:02:57.530
 attract more readers 

00:02:55.639 --> 00:03:00.379
 but even so there is no message 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:02.930
 very good so said to pass from a hero 

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:04.549
 much less the objectification of women 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:06.920
 is a characteristic that also does not 

00:03:04.549 --> 00:03:07.909
 very well with the character so it was 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:10.340
 well forced 

00:03:07.909 --> 00:03:11.900
 finally just an observation and now 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:14.090
 coming back with the power of the god boy and 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:16.340
 of the powers of this world they are not 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:18.260
 landmarks or anything apparently are just 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:20.510
 very strong warriors 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:22.340
 the origin of this force was not 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:24.620
 Anyway, this does not have a big deal. 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:26.690
 relevance to the story in a first 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:28.159
 What matters is that it was beautiful. 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:29.569
 to see the action scenes 

00:03:28.159 --> 00:03:31.669
 I thought the author was able to create 

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:33.769
 charismatic characters and that although 

00:03:31.669 --> 00:03:36.409
 have enough critical elements x 

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:38.239
 It could well be unique to itself 

00:03:36.409 --> 00:03:40.909
 interpretation of it in relation to 

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:42.530
 medieval period is very interesting and 

00:03:40.909 --> 00:03:44.599
 Moreover, the first volume has 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:46.400
 an end to the good that makes the 

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:48.859
 reader is extremely curious to 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:50.419
 know what happens next remembered 

00:03:48.859 --> 00:03:52.699
 quite the end of American serials 

00:03:50.419 --> 00:03:54.650
 who usually do this very well 

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:56.900
 good as you may have noticed 

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:57.859
 my impressions with the manga went well 

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:59.090
 positive 

00:03:57.859 --> 00:04:00.919
 I've heard comments saying that 

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:03.019
 receives the intelli gray is a work that 

00:04:00.919 --> 00:04:05.150
 does not have a great purpose that does not 

00:04:03.019 --> 00:04:07.699
 there's a big message behind the plot 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:09.799
 being kind of pure action and really 

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:12.169
 at least in this first volume the manga 

00:04:09.799 --> 00:04:13.909
 It is sold only as action sleeve 

00:04:12.169 --> 00:04:16.760
 charismatic villains characters 

00:04:13.909 --> 00:04:19.010
 interesting absurd forces an art 

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:20.570
 fuck and a country in very dynamic 

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:22.400
 I will not say that you have overcome my 

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:23.330
 expectations because my expectations 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:25.159
 were high 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:26.030
 but certainly the first volume of the 

00:04:25.159 --> 00:04:28.520
 seven deadly sins 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:29.210
 confirmed all the hype they do with the 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:31.370
 work 

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:33.020
 for those who like chonin and want some 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:35.630
 new thing other than shonen jump 

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:36.280
 the seven deadly sins can be a good 

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:37.940
 option 

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:40.010
