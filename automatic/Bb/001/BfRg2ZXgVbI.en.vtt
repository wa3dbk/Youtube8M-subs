statistical<00:03:21.470> output<00:03:22.750> that<00:03:23.750> was<00:03:24.049> the

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:24.170 
statistical output that was the

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:29.410 
statistical output that was the
university<00:03:24.620> I<00:03:24.650> saw<00:03:26.650> but<00:03:27.650> this<00:03:27.890> is<00:03:28.040> not<00:03:28.420> the

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:29.420 
university I saw but this is not the

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:34.460 
university I saw but this is not the
university<00:03:29.900> I'm<00:03:30.079> seeing<00:03:30.350> today<00:03:32.049> it<00:03:33.049> said

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:34.470 
university I'm seeing today it said

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:38.150 
university I'm seeing today it said
right<00:03:35.270> so<00:03:36.270> once<00:03:36.630> you<00:03:36.870> destroy<00:03:37.110> that<00:03:37.710> fountain

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:38.160 
right so once you destroy that fountain

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:41.510 
right so once you destroy that fountain
of<00:03:38.310> knowledge<00:03:38.490> when<00:03:39.120> you<00:03:39.240> get<00:03:40.340> using<00:03:41.340> whatever

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:41.520 
of knowledge when you get using whatever

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:50.060 
of knowledge when you get using whatever
metaphor<00:03:44.510> it's<00:03:45.510> muddied<00:03:46.640> it's<00:03:47.640> muddy<00:03:48.050> okay<00:03:49.070> so

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:50.070 
metaphor it's muddied it's muddy okay so

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:53.900 
metaphor it's muddied it's muddy okay so
they<00:03:51.030> should<00:03:51.210> think<00:03:51.510> seriously<00:03:52.910> they

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:53.910 
they should think seriously they

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:58.490 
they should think seriously they
