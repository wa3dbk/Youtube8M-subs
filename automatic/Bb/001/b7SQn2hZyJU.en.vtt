00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:20.460 
a monumental undertaking there there and
basically<00:03:18.390> remaking<00:03:19.390> the<00:03:19.720> game<00:03:19.900> essentially

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:20.470 
basically remaking the game essentially

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:22.410 
basically remaking the game essentially
on<00:03:20.560> a<00:03:20.590> brand-new<00:03:20.980> engine<00:03:21.250> so<00:03:21.850> if<00:03:22.060> I<00:03:22.209> were<00:03:22.360> to

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:22.420 
on a brand-new engine so if I were to

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:25.140 
on a brand-new engine so if I were to
assume<00:03:23.050> anything<00:03:23.290> without<00:03:23.830> any<00:03:24.160> details

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:25.150 
assume anything without any details

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:27.480 
assume anything without any details
further<00:03:25.660> than<00:03:25.990> what<00:03:26.110> we<00:03:26.200> have<00:03:26.380> so<00:03:26.590> far<00:03:26.620> I<00:03:27.070> would

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:27.490 
further than what we have so far I would

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:29.009 
further than what we have so far I would
say<00:03:27.700> you<00:03:27.970> know<00:03:28.060> they<00:03:28.239> realize<00:03:28.540> this<00:03:28.720> is<00:03:28.840> going

00:03:29.009 --> 00:03:29.019 
say you know they realize this is going

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:30.750 
say you know they realize this is going
to<00:03:29.080> take<00:03:29.260> quite<00:03:29.620> a<00:03:29.680> long<00:03:29.830> time<00:03:30.010> they're

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:30.760 
to take quite a long time they're

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:33.420 
to take quite a long time they're
completely<00:03:31.290> overhauling<00:03:32.290> the<00:03:32.560> game<00:03:32.769> and<00:03:33.070> so

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:33.430 
completely overhauling the game and so

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:34.979 
completely overhauling the game and so
they<00:03:33.550> wanted<00:03:33.850> to<00:03:34.000> take<00:03:34.150> it<00:03:34.300> down<00:03:34.420> for<00:03:34.630> purchase

00:03:34.979 --> 00:03:34.989 
they wanted to take it down for purchase

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:36.540 
they wanted to take it down for purchase
so<00:03:35.140> people<00:03:35.440> aren't<00:03:35.590> buying<00:03:35.680> into<00:03:36.160> something

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:36.550 
so people aren't buying into something

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:38.759 
so people aren't buying into something
that<00:03:36.580> might<00:03:36.880> not<00:03:37.030> get<00:03:37.239> updated<00:03:37.840> for<00:03:38.230> a<00:03:38.440> long

00:03:38.759 --> 00:03:38.769 
that might not get updated for a long

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:40.560 
that might not get updated for a long
long<00:03:39.010> time<00:03:39.070> I<00:03:39.340> mean<00:03:39.670> again<00:03:39.940> they're<00:03:40.090> stopping

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:40.570 
long time I mean again they're stopping

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:42.060 
long time I mean again they're stopping
