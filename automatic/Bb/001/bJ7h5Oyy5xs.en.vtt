00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:09.189
 I would have to singleplayer people 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:10.899

00:01:09.189 --> 00:01:13.540

 appreciates that it sells again 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:22.450
 I heard so many people 

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:24.789
 for example in my videos or 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:26.770
 other videos because of murder gta4 again 

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:29.499
 bought on the pc rockstedt 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:30.850
 never would have made the sales 

00:01:29.499 --> 00:01:32.409
 that did not buy and now there already 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:33.609
 The first people say that well 

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:35.770
 draw now just he goes on about 

00:01:33.609 --> 00:01:37.630
 torrent and then fuck you 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:39.399
 rockstar so I can have want 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:41.139
 Do not say that somehow now that you 

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:43.240
 you should now what I should 

00:01:41.139 --> 00:01:44.979
 now it's like that rockstar 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:46.840
 Lose a lot of people through it 

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:48.219
 if they keep it that way 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:49.840
 we it is now to the now I want 

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:51.850
 tbc times do I hide you 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:53.950
 here again the pictures 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:55.479
 So here's just the course 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:57.520
 So above you can see the comment from 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:59.139
 the guy who has just asked himself whether 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:00.579
 you have to use the single player must 

00:01:59.139 --> 00:02:03.069
 he wrote that he was already in 

00:02:00.579 --> 00:02:04.450
 singleplayer has everything through and has 

00:02:03.069 --> 00:02:06.729
 then stop rockstar asked this 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:08.860
 Looks like you are a coach in the 

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:10.450
 blade player can do or like it 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:11.560
 then it looks like when you 're in private log 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:13.569
 applies with friends when you go to 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:16.209
 for example, a car sport or something 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:18.250
 not at the rp or money so does the 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:20.739
 rockstar's official response is that 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:22.470
 they do not recommend mods to use 

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:24.540
 No matter if it is set 5 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:25.920
 in singleplayer is or goes online 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:28.770
 he says he's sorry 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:31.170
 yes, but they just do not want to 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:34.410
 that people are changing that 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:36.750
 I know why, and that just because 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:38.640
 that if something is changed she will 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:40.200
 allegedly not distinguished in this way 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:42.570
 whether it is multi or im 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:44.220
 singleplayer is yes thereby becomes 

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:46.260
 your account is spotted and it may be too 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:48.870
 come to a band and then stands down 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:51.510
 again so who have no train 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:53.580
 it does not want to be in the future 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:54.150
 So it does not recommend it to anyone wet 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:57.540
 close 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:59.310
 so now you have that on the table like 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:01.290
 it looks like now so people exists 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:03.120
 now the tracks danger if you only 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:05.190
 it is installed in the singleplayer mod 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:07.020
 no matter as if it is a graphic mod or 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:08.520
 an effort or whether it is a trainer 

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:10.620
 you can become the band for that now 

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:12.420
 and I just think that shit 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:15.630
 how boxer deals with the model 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:17.940
 community rockstar something of many people 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:19.920
 has only bought the pc on the pc 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:21.000
 wants to have the order as I do 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:22.620
 example I actually have it myself 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.970
 not bought because of the artwork and 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:26.250
 just that I can kill again 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:28.830
 You have to think you are buying from 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:30.810
 rockstar every every game i have mine 

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:32.519
 bought by rockstar extremely ps4 that 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:33.540
 I go again to witness the ps4 

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:36.150
 ready for the I would have never been a 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:37.590
 psp bought and so on then you buy 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:40.019
 you the game with the third time 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:41.880
 so that it still hate on the pc and must 

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:43.560
 then you'll have to pay for that 

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:45.330
 You can be if you planned this 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:47.820
 I mean, that does not matter 

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:51.360
 meaning people the modder community at the pc 

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:53.940
 that is simply because so murdered 

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:55.820
 it simply game there remains where it is 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:58.530
 I will not do my box there 

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:59.940
 10,000 goal of still hewing out that we 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:01.739
 now have some of the game at some point 

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:04.290
 gets very boring so what do we do 

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:05.780
 then when it gets boring what should 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:08.280
 we still do that I mean 

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:10.650
 live moths and that was like gta 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:12.420
 4 the case is think the a4 was a 

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:14.280
 I have to play real trek 

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:15.859
 honestly on pc you could do that 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:17.790
 Just did not play it was game 

00:04:15.859 --> 00:04:18.600
 abysmal ugly or graphic yes 

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:20.850
 one would like to say 

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:22.500
 and he crashes all the time 

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:23.580
 always you still have no fix 

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:25.080
 rausged that at all 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:27.300
 graphics card is detected today is must 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:29.130
 you have to think because you have to if if 

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:30.390
 that does not work on your pc you have to 

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:31.860
 write rockstar and write 

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:33.830
 you then yes you have to come then 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:36.260
 do not write that the ladies 

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:37.490
 According to read out for that would not be 

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:39.650
 so much was spent on a video card 

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:41.780
 reinzuhauen I people I say as 

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:43.010
 I think that is the abysmal side of 

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:44.720
 I would not have thought rockstar 

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:46.840
 that's how I handle it 

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:49.550
 thought that they do it that way 

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:51.110
 as a solution to the modern 

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:53.270
 together that they for example the 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:55.460
 share singleplayer and multiplayer 

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:58.190
 as well as with cod that for example the case 

00:04:55.460 --> 00:05:00.260
 is that once it's a singleplayer 

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:02.090
 Whimsy gives and a multiplayer 

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:03.740
 launcher or that for example even 

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:05.390
 can not shy away from the data 

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:06.950
 First, be checked by the folder 

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:09.080
 that you are even here in the 

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:10.760
 multiplayer can go yes or to 

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:12.440
 example, better anti cheat system that 

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:13.760
 if you go in multiplayer with mods 

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:16.820
 that one is done for that I know 

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:19.100
 I find this behavior that one 

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:22.310
 then everything wants to go the same way 

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:24.410
 yes that's just bad and me 

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:26.740
 can you honestly say so 

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:29.480
 rockstar shot himself 

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:31.550
 and I hope that remember that too and 

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:33.080
 should honestly try rockstar too 

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:36.530
 I already have mail 

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:38.300
 rockstar skill with things that you 

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:40.640
 that could change as I said 

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:42.530
 that in the singleplayer own lounge 

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:43.910
 so multiplayer you have to stop that 

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:46.040
 Writing everything in English does that 

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:49.010
 simply people just write in the 

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:51.170
 comments gt5 mobbings not a 

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:53.450
 Crime without joke makes it easy 

00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:55.340
 spam that he goes under every humor 

00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:58.100
 fucking going on the 5 as that is something 

00:05:55.340 --> 00:06:00.350
 No matter we just have to go to the people 

00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:02.480
 Show that we are not just like that 

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:04.430
 make wonder sound where max since we 

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:06.500
 really want to kill again without him 

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:08.300
 how to be spellbound and should it 

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:10.400
 That's really what it's really like 

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:12.020
 very last of orchestra and have 

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:13.490
 I really did not expect so much people 

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:16.400
 that you get the latest information for 

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:17.870
 So you used when you leave the 

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:20.000
 just want to play online 

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:21.380
 no mods at the moment i also know boxer 

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.660
 that will ever change, I hope 

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:24.920
 if not then rockstar must me 

00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:28.280
 died honestly 

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:29.310
 So people skin in, I thank you 

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:32.370
 for to see 

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:35.250
 and it just makes it happen 

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:36.360
 and write box because we just do it 

00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:39.200
 want to do something 

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:39.200
 so people
