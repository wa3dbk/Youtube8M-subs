00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:05.660
 you do not occupy being a lover of movies 

00:00:03.139 --> 00:00:09.440
 disney so you've managed to see the 

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:11.660
 movie of recreating or entangled said 

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:15.170
 movie was released in November 

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:15.950
 2010 and distributed by various cinemas of 

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:19.220
 Latin America 

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:21.730
 even in Europe since all 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:24.619
 walt disney production usually 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:27.859
 transcends the movie worldwide 

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:30.439
 It was a total success but the raw 

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:34.039
 reality is that the history of entangled 

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:36.979
 or rapunzel already existed for a long time 

00:00:34.039 --> 00:00:40.850
 time and I'll tell you how it was 

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:42.990
 originally that is before disney 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:45.810
 the purchase 

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:48.420
 in medieval times it used to 

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:51.360
 that adults will tell you many 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:53.880
 stories invented to their children just 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:56.460
 so they understood some dangers 

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:59.460
 that they should not run in their next 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.050
 years of life because at that 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:04.770
 then most children 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:07.920
 they worked hard in forests and 

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:10.350
 faced dangers day by day these 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:13.140
 stories were usually very 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:16.710
 Terrifying if morbidly so that 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:18.360
 they learned better the lesson was in that 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.270
 then when the brothers grimm 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:24.600
 they collected stories to sell them to 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:27.869
 the rich and one of them was the story 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:30.780
 from rapunzel the original story of 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:34.260
 rapunzel is carried out in Germany 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:37.590
 the middle age where rapunzel not even 

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:40.350
 she is a princess rather she is the daughter of 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:43.170
 peasants which were 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:45.360
 very poor in fact on one occasion the 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:48.600
 poor peasants were dead of 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:52.280
 hungry and decide to give rapunzel to a 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:55.590
 witch just in exchange for food 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:02:00.270
 specifically in exchange for some turnips 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:02.789
 which in German are called rapunzel is 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:06.450
 That's where the name of this 

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:09.629
 disney princess just that as in the 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:12.480
 movie this never happens then disney 

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:15.810
 and he does not tell you or rather you do not 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:20.010
 tells the origins of his scary name 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:22.830
 no but wait for this to just start 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:24.870
 unlike the movie in the book 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:27.209
 the first time he reposes he has 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:29.310
 contact with someone from royalty is 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:31.769
 when the prince meets casually 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:35.370
 the tower where he was 

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:37.920
 locked because the witch was leaving 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:39.810
 the tower alone at night in that 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:43.230
 moment was when the prince and 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:46.200
 rapunzel took the opportunity to see each other but 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:49.590
 little by little they fell in love and the 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:52.349
 witch on one occasion I will notice that 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:56.250
 she was seeing herself with someone like 

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:59.849
 he knew it simple rapunzel had 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:01.090
 grown up the belly like that is 

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:02.950
 pregnant 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:05.560
 obviously the movie has been seen 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:09.730
 you will know that all this was omitted by 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:13.150
 disney in the end the witch angered 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:15.550
 He cut rapunzel's hair and tied it to 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:17.410
 the tower window waiting for 

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:20.349
 the prince will arrive the following night 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:23.069
 and will climb by this same since the 

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:27.099
 Prince did not know what happened came 

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:30.700
 He rose and met the witch herself 

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:34.049
 He pushed the prince through the window 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:36.610
 fell on a plant of thorns which 

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:39.400
 they cushioned his fall but also 

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:43.660
 they had managed to hurt in the deepest 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:46.480
 of her eyes leaving him blind the witch 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:48.730
 took rapunzel away from that tower the 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:51.069
 prince in his eagerness to follow his love 

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:53.890
 and regardless of his seriousness he followed 

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:57.910
 searching for several years until he 

00:03:53.890 --> 00:04:01.840
 He finally found her but she was not alone 

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:03.700
 she was accompanied by her two babies, so 

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:05.770
 I had twins 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:08.470
 in the end things do not end so 

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:10.870
 gloomy because rapunzel drops 

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:13.569
 a drop of his tears in the eyes of 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:16.959
 your prince and you can already imagine what 

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:19.150
 what happened but it's definitely interesting 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:22.540
 that as Disney modifies the stories 

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:24.800
 to a very childlike point which 

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:26.509
 has given great results
