drum solo and this video will be

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.190 
drum solo and this video will be
especially<00:00:11.460> useful<00:00:11.759> for<00:00:12.360> beginners<00:00:12.480> but

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
especially useful for beginners but

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.839 
especially useful for beginners but
advanced<00:00:13.559> drivers<00:00:14.009> will<00:00:14.160> still<00:00:14.400> be<00:00:14.549> able<00:00:14.639> to

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
advanced drivers will still be able to

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:17.240 
advanced drivers will still be able to
incorporate<00:00:15.179> it<00:00:15.690> into<00:00:15.900> their<00:00:16.379> drumming<00:00:17.039> beats

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
incorporate it into their drumming beats

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.670 
incorporate it into their drumming beats
and<00:00:17.520> their<00:00:17.730> drum<00:00:18.000> soles<00:00:18.300> so<00:00:18.960> I<00:00:19.260> can<00:00:19.560> get

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
and their drum soles so I can get

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:20.990 
and their drum soles so I can get
straight<00:00:19.920> to<00:00:20.070> the<00:00:20.160> point<00:00:20.369> when<00:00:20.850> you're

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
straight to the point when you're

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.490 
straight to the point when you're
playing<00:00:21.240> a<00:00:21.330> drum<00:00:21.570> solo<00:00:21.840> you're<00:00:22.050> going<00:00:22.170> to<00:00:22.230> want

playing a drum solo you're going to want
to<00:00:22.590> start<00:00:22.859> off<00:00:23.010> with<00:00:23.220> what<00:00:24.150> I<00:00:24.180> like<00:00:24.390> to<00:00:24.510> call

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
to start off with what I like to call

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.990 
to start off with what I like to call
the<00:00:24.779> backbone<00:00:25.439> of<00:00:25.470> your<00:00:25.769> solo<00:00:26.099> and<00:00:26.400> that<00:00:26.460> is<00:00:26.970> a

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
the backbone of your solo and that is a

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.509 
the backbone of your solo and that is a
consistent<00:00:27.570> base<00:00:28.140> drum<00:00:28.529> beat<00:00:28.800> that<00:00:29.310> goes

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
consistent base drum beat that goes

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:32.630 
consistent base drum beat that goes
something<00:00:29.789> long<00:00:30.090> lines<00:00:30.390> up<00:00:30.630> one<00:00:31.170> two<00:00:31.830> three

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
something long lines up one two three

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.740 
something long lines up one two three
four<00:00:33.329> one<00:00:34.050> two<00:00:34.710> three<00:00:35.180> four<00:00:36.180> and<00:00:36.450> it<00:00:36.600> should

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
four one two three four and it should

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:43.910 
four one two three four and it should
sound<00:00:36.960> like<00:00:37.110> this<00:00:37.350> and<00:00:42.500> that<00:00:43.500> is<00:00:43.620> basically

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
sound like this and that is basically

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.029 
sound like this and that is basically
the<00:00:44.219> backbone<00:00:44.670> of<00:00:45.300> your<00:00:45.390> drum<00:00:45.960> solo<00:00:46.350> now

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
the backbone of your drum solo now

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.400 
the backbone of your drum solo now
unless<00:00:47.610> you<00:00:47.879> have<00:00:48.059> that<00:00:48.090> backbone<00:00:48.780> down<00:00:49.110> pad

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
unless you have that backbone down pad

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.380 
unless you have that backbone down pad
which<00:00:49.620> I'm<00:00:49.770> sure<00:00:50.129> you'll<00:00:50.579> have<00:00:50.670> dumped<00:00:51.059> out<00:00:51.270> in

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
which I'm sure you'll have dumped out in

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.330 
which I'm sure you'll have dumped out in
a<00:00:51.449> matter<00:00:51.660> of<00:00:51.750> a<00:00:51.870> minute<00:00:52.079> or<00:00:52.350> so<00:00:52.559> you're<00:00:53.160> going
