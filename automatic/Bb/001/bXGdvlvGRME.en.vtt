00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:23.150
 my dear friends who 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:25.430
 accompany this program of our 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:28.250
 publisher would feel comfortable with 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:30.619
 Clesia is with great joy that we 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:34.790
 We want to wish you a merry Christmas. 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:37.520
 a holy saint, but it is also necessary that 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:38.540
 we understand the depth of this 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:41.230
 party 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:44.330
 actually christmas is one hour 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:46.580
 event in the history of mankind 

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:49.670
 for those who have faith of those who 

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:52.309
 believe in God of those who say that 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:54.559
 our lord jesus christ is god is 

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:58.579
 our redeemer and savior 

00:00:54.559 --> 00:01:01.489
 Christmas is the big party because the party 

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:04.550
 in which god became man the deity if 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:07.009
 united with humanity is a mystery 

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:09.670
 It is a great mystery that we do not 

00:01:07.009 --> 00:01:12.740
 we can understand how God 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:15.920
 in all its potentiality its 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:22.430
 infinitude to omnipotence omniscience 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:26.090
 omnipresence can be in a human being or 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:29.330
 that boy from the manger of Bethlehem are 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:34.600
 Paulo says that he has become poor for us. 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:37.790
 enriching descended to our humanity 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:39.590
 wounded for original sin to 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:42.829
 lift up this humanity 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:46.039
 come back to atheists do not expect like me 

00:01:42.829 --> 00:01:49.670
 said it is ineffable we do not have conditions 

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:51.619
 teleteatros of understanding them but there 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:52.909
 a country explanation is a mystery of 

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:54.530
 love 

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:56.899
 what the intelligence of man does not 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:59.890
 can explain what understanding 

00:01:56.899 --> 00:02:03.920
 human can not understand God's love 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:08.090
 can reveal are John where the gospel 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:11.720
 lucas chapter 3116 god loved the 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:15.620
 world to such an extent that he gave his son 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:19.700
 only here for everyone who believes in him 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:21.200
 do not have death on earth but have 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:24.379
 eternal life 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:28.190
 So it's a mystery of God's love that 

00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:31.610
 comes down to us and he who is rich has become 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:34.849
 poor he who is god became man he 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:37.099
 who is all powerful has become fragile and is 

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:40.670
 awesome how jesus was born small 

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:43.489
 born poor was born poor did not have 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:45.920
 no bed to be much less one 

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:48.530
 maternity to be born and in a house 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:50.090
 born in a stable was born in a grotto 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:52.160
 Cold of Bethlehem 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:54.350
 when we go to the holy land visit 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:57.440
 to that cave we see that it really is 

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:59.239
 one was a rectangle of animals a hole 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:02.420
 in the stone right? 

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:03.769
 was the only thing left for the 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:06.410
 King of the world 

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:10.069
 the kingdom of heaven gave me the son on the sixth 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:12.380
 of us, why does Jesus say Nasser? 

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:15.049
 above you also had to leave to 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:17.840
 us a lesson in alexandra o 

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:21.530
 disregard the lesson of simplicity 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:22.880
 humility election sao paulo in letter 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:25.819
 to the Philippians a very 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:27.739
 interesting he being god did not 

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:32.780
 Proud of being God 

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:35.359
 but he became a man and becoming a 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:37.200
 slave and making the slaves 

00:03:35.359 --> 00:03:41.519
 invented death 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:44.180
 existed in his time to death on the cross 

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:47.010
 the Roman citizen was not crucified 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:49.890
 because the cross is an unworthiness for the 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:52.110
 Roman citizen Jesus walks because he was not 

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:54.090
 because it helps the citizen robot 

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:56.640
 Roman was the beheaded 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:59.940
 but Jesus came through all this 

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:03.810
 went through every phase of our life 

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:08.400
 human being to resist rescuing all 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:11.430
 our human life and the goal of Jesus 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:12.989
 What was the ordeal was to take the 

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:16.820
 sin of the world 

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:20.519
 he was born says expanded and died disposes 

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:22.620
 the opportunist and jesus had nothing 

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:25.500
 In this life all that he had was 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:27.660
 the manger where he was born was 

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:29.729
 provided that fight was interviewed 

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:31.380
 that little donkey he set up for 

00:04:29.729 --> 00:04:34.050
 entering the city of jerusalem was 

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:37.139
 borrowed everything that Jesus used did not 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:39.840
 had lent said that the only thing 

00:04:37.139 --> 00:04:44.340
 that he was in fact the cross. 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:46.500
 to have been nailed to the cross he 

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:50.070
 said whoever wants to be my disciple takes 

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:51.960
 his cross every day and follow me then 

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:54.210
 siblings, the Christmas party is the 

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:59.690
 the cheerleading party and the light because 

00:04:54.210 --> 00:05:02.700
 he is the light of the world said I am abuse 

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:05.280
 he that followeth me shall not walk in 

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:07.770
 and said very clearly that I did not 

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:09.960
 follow now in the dark 

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:12.720
 Pope John Paul II once said a 

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:15.990
 very beautiful sentence from our first 

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:18.750
 encyclical that he wrote the pope 

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:20.430
 encyclical jesus redeemer of the men pope 

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:23.490
 joao paulo 2o said 

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:26.880
 so the man jesus christ remains 

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:30.660
 for himself an unknown one 

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:34.680
 secret can not be revealed one 

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:39.150
 an indecipherable puzzle because it is Christ who 

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:42.880
 reveals the man that he is that we are the 

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:45.790
 that we make here where we go 

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:48.430
 in nine games who knows jesus christ 

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:50.380
 Your message has an answer for all 

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:54.040
 the questions 

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:57.370
