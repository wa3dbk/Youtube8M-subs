so<00:02:49.080> but<00:02:50.080> in<00:02:50.380> my<00:02:50.410> experience<00:02:50.950> especially<00:02:51.610> with

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:52.090 
so but in my experience especially with

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:55.820 
so but in my experience especially with
the<00:02:53.050> Pro<00:02:53.290> Series<00:02:53.530> you<00:02:54.100> know<00:02:54.250> the<00:02:54.280> the<00:02:55.030> g<00:02:55.480> series

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:55.830 
the Pro Series you know the the g series

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:59.070 
the Pro Series you know the the g series
pro<00:02:56.830> they<00:02:57.640> have<00:02:57.820> these<00:02:58.000> electrolytes<00:02:58.750> that

00:02:59.070 --> 00:02:59.080 
pro they have these electrolytes that

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:03.000 
pro they have these electrolytes that
they<00:02:59.470> use<00:03:00.690> they<00:03:01.690> don't<00:03:01.900> necessarily<00:03:02.260> make<00:03:02.860> it

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.010 
they use they don't necessarily make it

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:05.160 
they use they don't necessarily make it
taste<00:03:03.220> any<00:03:03.460> better<00:03:03.600> maybe<00:03:04.600> a<00:03:04.690> little<00:03:04.750> more

for you know kinda like that salty taste
account<00:03:09.310> as<00:03:09.520> but<00:03:10.210> that's<00:03:10.420> the<00:03:10.540> electrolyzer

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:11.080 
account as but that's the electrolyzer

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:12.990 
account as but that's the electrolyzer
and<00:03:11.410> that's<00:03:11.530> the<00:03:11.650> sodium<00:03:12.130> and<00:03:12.370> the<00:03:12.430> potassium

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:13.000 
and that's the sodium and the potassium

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.130 
and that's the sodium and the potassium
both<00:03:13.420> of<00:03:13.570> us<00:03:13.690> the<00:03:14.290> pro<00:03:14.530> has<00:03:15.780> and<00:03:16.780> they're

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:17.140 
both of us the pro has and they're

which is more the potassium finally and
this<00:03:28.000> is<00:03:28.180> my<00:03:28.270> favorite<00:03:28.540> part<00:03:28.780> check<00:03:29.110> this<00:03:29.260> out

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:29.500 
this is my favorite part check this out

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:32.940 
this is my favorite part check this out
this<00:03:30.130> is<00:03:30.340> so<00:03:30.550> cool<00:03:30.790> gatorade<00:03:31.600> prime<00:03:31.950> contains

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:32.950 
this is so cool gatorade prime contains

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:35.550 
this is so cool gatorade prime contains
both<00:03:33.250> carbohydrates<00:03:34.030> are<00:03:34.209> fast<00:03:34.570> burning<00:03:34.870> like

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:35.560 
both carbohydrates are fast burning like

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:38.850 
both carbohydrates are fast burning like
regular<00:03:35.950> gatorade<00:03:36.340> you<00:03:37.120> know<00:03:37.239> but<00:03:37.510> prime<00:03:38.410> is

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:38.860 
regular gatorade you know but prime is

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:40.590 
regular gatorade you know but prime is
specialized<00:03:39.550> that<00:03:39.820> also<00:03:40.209> contains

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:40.600 
specialized that also contains

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:42.330 
specialized that also contains
slow-burning<00:03:41.320> carbohydrate<00:03:42.010> so<00:03:42.100> this<00:03:42.250> is

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:42.340 
slow-burning carbohydrate so this is

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:45.330 
slow-burning carbohydrate so this is
absolutely<00:03:43.030> awesome<00:03:43.320> this<00:03:44.320> is<00:03:44.560> clearly<00:03:44.980> seen

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:45.340 
absolutely awesome this is clearly seen

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:47.940 
absolutely awesome this is clearly seen
in<00:03:45.370> that<00:03:45.580> Prime<00:03:45.970> has<00:03:46.270> 43<00:03:46.900> grams<00:03:47.140> of<00:03:47.320> sugars<00:03:47.590> so

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:47.950 
in that Prime has 43 grams of sugars so

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:49.920 
in that Prime has 43 grams of sugars so
that's<00:03:48.700> what<00:03:48.880> this<00:03:49.030> stuff<00:03:49.239> has<00:03:49.420> you<00:03:49.570> know<00:03:49.720> like

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:49.930 
that's what this stuff has you know like

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:52.199 
that's what this stuff has you know like
we<00:03:50.620> have<00:03:50.830> 43<00:03:51.220> grams<00:03:51.400> of<00:03:51.580> sugars<00:03:51.820> drinking<00:03:52.120> that

00:03:52.199 --> 00:03:52.209 
we have 43 grams of sugars drinking that

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:53.520 
we have 43 grams of sugars drinking that
easily<00:03:52.570> you<00:03:52.600> know<00:03:52.750> and<00:03:52.989> you'll<00:03:53.110> go<00:03:53.260> up<00:03:53.440> and

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:53.530 
easily you know and you'll go up and

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:55.710 
easily you know and you'll go up and
you'll<00:03:53.650> come<00:03:53.830> back<00:03:53.920> down<00:03:54.130> in<00:03:54.370> a<00:03:54.430> crash<00:03:54.720> you

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:55.720 
you'll come back down in a crash you

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:56.820 
you'll come back down in a crash you
know<00:03:55.810> it's<00:03:55.959> made<00:03:56.110> more<00:03:56.350> for<00:03:56.560> during

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:56.830 
know it's made more for during

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:58.650 
know it's made more for during
competition<00:03:57.370> but<00:03:57.489> this<00:03:57.580> is<00:03:57.760> an<00:03:58.030> array<00:03:58.390> for

00:03:58.650 --> 00:03:58.660 
competition but this is an array for

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:02.490 
competition but this is an array for
competition<00:03:59.350> so<00:03:59.950> also<00:04:00.220> has<00:04:00.580> 82<00:04:01.150> grams<00:04:01.540> of

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:02.500 
competition so also has 82 grams of

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:04.320 
competition so also has 82 grams of
carbohydrates<00:04:03.190> overall<00:04:03.520> so<00:04:03.700> there's<00:04:03.850> 43

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:04.330 
carbohydrates overall so there's 43

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:06.390 
carbohydrates overall so there's 43
grams<00:04:04.480> of<00:04:04.630> sugars<00:04:04.930> that's<00:04:05.470> your<00:04:05.650> first<00:04:05.830> 43

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:06.400 
grams of sugars that's your first 43

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:08.580 
grams of sugars that's your first 43
carbohydrates<00:04:07.060> but<00:04:07.600> then<00:04:07.780> there's<00:04:07.959> all<00:04:08.260> these

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:08.590 
carbohydrates but then there's all these

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:11.030 
carbohydrates but then there's all these
other<00:04:08.830> carbohydrates<00:04:09.610> that<00:04:09.700> equal<00:04:10.090> up<00:04:10.390> to<00:04:10.420> 82

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:11.040 
other carbohydrates that equal up to 82

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:14.430 
other carbohydrates that equal up to 82
