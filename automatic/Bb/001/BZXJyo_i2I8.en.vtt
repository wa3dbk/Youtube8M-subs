one<00:01:59.020> in<00:01:59.170> it<00:02:00.180> but<00:02:01.180> there<00:02:01.330> you<00:02:01.420> go<00:02:01.479> I<00:02:01.570> just<00:02:01.659> want

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:01.930 
one in it but there you go I just want

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:03.360 
one in it but there you go I just want
to<00:02:02.020> show<00:02:02.140> you<00:02:02.200> that<00:02:02.350> in<00:02:02.500> case<00:02:02.650> you<00:02:02.799> were<00:02:02.920> trying

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:03.370 
to show you that in case you were trying

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:04.289 
to show you that in case you were trying
to<00:02:03.430> figure<00:02:03.610> out<00:02:03.640> how<00:02:03.790> to<00:02:03.850> do<00:02:04.000> this<00:02:04.120> for

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:04.299 
to figure out how to do this for

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:06.510 
to figure out how to do this for
yourself<00:02:04.390> just<00:02:05.260> pop<00:02:05.470> that<00:02:05.680> cap<00:02:05.920> off<00:02:06.190> and<00:02:06.430> your

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:06.520 
yourself just pop that cap off and your

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:07.770 
yourself just pop that cap off and your
points<00:02:06.850> are<00:02:06.940> right<00:02:07.090> under<00:02:07.360> there<00:02:07.540> and<00:02:07.659> I'm

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:07.780 
points are right under there and I'm

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:09.359 
points are right under there and I'm
gonna<00:02:07.900> go<00:02:08.409> ahead<00:02:08.530> and<00:02:08.619> change<00:02:08.860> them<00:02:09.039> right<00:02:09.190> now

00:02:09.359 --> 00:02:09.369 
gonna go ahead and change them right now

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:12.360 
gonna go ahead and change them right now
so<00:02:09.989> here<00:02:10.989> it<00:02:11.080> is<00:02:11.230> got<00:02:11.680> the<00:02:11.739> new<00:02:11.860> points<00:02:12.250> and

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.370 
so here it is got the new points and

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:14.640 
so here it is got the new points and
condenser<00:02:12.819> in<00:02:13.000> it<00:02:13.200> and<00:02:14.200> that's<00:02:14.319> running

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:14.650 
condenser in it and that's running

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:17.040 
condenser in it and that's running
pretty<00:02:15.130> decent<00:02:15.730> I've<00:02:16.150> had<00:02:16.330> it<00:02:16.450> going<00:02:16.750> for

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:17.050 
pretty decent I've had it going for

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:18.990 
pretty decent I've had it going for
maybe<00:02:17.980> 20<00:02:18.430> minutes<00:02:18.700> now

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.000 
maybe 20 minutes now

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.460 
maybe 20 minutes now
I've<00:02:19.180> I've<00:02:19.600> mode<00:02:19.870> a<00:02:19.900> little<00:02:20.260> bit<00:02:20.440> with<00:02:21.430> it

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
I've I've mode a little bit with it

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:25.830 
I've I've mode a little bit with it
seems<00:02:23.470> to<00:02:23.560> be<00:02:23.650> running<00:02:23.940> better<00:02:24.940> the<00:02:25.450> longer<00:02:25.630> I

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840 
seems to be running better the longer I

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:30.180 
seems to be running better the longer I
use<00:02:26.170> it<00:02:28.170> so<00:02:29.170> I<00:02:29.230> don't<00:02:29.410> know<00:02:29.500> I<00:02:29.530> figured<00:02:29.830> I'd<00:02:29.950> set

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.190 
use it so I don't know I figured I'd set

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:32.340 
use it so I don't know I figured I'd set
this<00:02:30.340> up<00:02:30.610> and<00:02:30.820> get<00:02:31.720> a<00:02:31.750> little<00:02:32.020> bit<00:02:32.170> of<00:02:32.290> the

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:32.350 
this up and get a little bit of the

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:38.790 
this up and get a little bit of the
video<00:02:32.530> going<00:02:33.490> here<00:02:33.970> for<00:02:34.180> the<00:02:34.270> first<00:02:34.480> time<00:02:37.800> I'll

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:38.800 
video going here for the first time I'll

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:58.630 
video going here for the first time I'll
show<00:02:39.010> you<00:02:39.070> a<00:02:39.190> quick<00:02:39.400> video<00:02:39.550> of<00:02:39.880> it

00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:58.640 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:02.050

passes<00:03:02.540> of<00:03:02.690> it<00:03:02.810> mowing<00:03:03.140> it<00:03:03.290> it's<00:03:04.100> running

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:04.490 
passes of it mowing it it's running

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:06.880 
passes of it mowing it it's running
pretty<00:03:04.670> good<00:03:04.790> it<00:03:05.450> seems<00:03:06.050> a<00:03:06.290> little<00:03:06.440> lackluster

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:06.890 
pretty good it seems a little lackluster

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:11.110 
pretty good it seems a little lackluster
yet<00:03:07.520> in<00:03:07.730> in<00:03:08.000> power<00:03:09.010> I'm<00:03:10.010> kind<00:03:10.640> of<00:03:10.700> wondering<00:03:10.880> if

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:11.120 
yet in in power I'm kind of wondering if

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:12.790 
yet in in power I'm kind of wondering if
there<00:03:11.270> might<00:03:11.450> be<00:03:11.480> a<00:03:11.630> you<00:03:12.290> know<00:03:12.470> like

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:14.890 
there might be a you know like
compression<00:03:13.459> related<00:03:14.090> problem<00:03:14.450> maybe<00:03:14.600> in<00:03:14.810> the

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:14.900 
compression related problem maybe in the

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:17.080 
compression related problem maybe in the
exhaust<00:03:15.290> side<00:03:15.560> of<00:03:15.680> things<00:03:15.890> I<00:03:16.130> don't<00:03:16.850> know<00:03:16.910> but

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:17.090 
exhaust side of things I don't know but

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:19.300 
exhaust side of things I don't know but
