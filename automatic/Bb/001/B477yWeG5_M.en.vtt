00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
today so let's get started so what we've

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.530 
today so let's get started so what we've
done<00:01:25.409> here<00:01:25.680> is<00:01:25.830> we've<00:01:26.400> removed<00:01:26.729> all<00:01:27.030> the<00:01:27.090> pits

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540

done here is we've removed all the pits
the<00:01:28.290> bird<00:01:28.740> will<00:01:28.890> probably<00:01:29.189> handle<00:01:29.460> the<00:01:29.549> pits

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759

the bird will probably handle the pits
we'll<00:01:29.939> try<00:01:30.210> that<00:01:30.390> in<00:01:30.509> just<00:01:30.750> a<00:01:30.840> minute

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
we'll try that in just a minute

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:32.929 
we'll try that in just a minute
but<00:01:31.590> what<00:01:31.740> we<00:01:31.860> did<00:01:32.070> to<00:01:32.280> make<00:01:32.460> things<00:01:32.700> much

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
but what we did to make things much

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.330 
but what we did to make things much
easier<00:01:33.000> is<00:01:33.509> we<00:01:34.049> just<00:01:34.229> basically<00:01:34.470> removed<00:01:35.100> all

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340

half-hour<00:01:46.140> ago<00:01:46.350> and<00:01:46.740> even<00:01:46.860> though<00:01:47.070> we<00:01:47.189> just

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
half-hour ago and even though we just

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.429 
half-hour ago and even though we just
did<00:01:47.520> it<00:01:47.610> a<00:01:47.670> half-hour<00:01:48.060> ago<00:01:48.240> the<00:01:49.110> fruit

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
did it a half-hour ago the fruit

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.620 
did it a half-hour ago the fruit
basically<00:01:49.979> oxidizes<00:01:50.790> and<00:01:50.970> is<00:01:51.060> turning<00:01:51.390> brown

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
basically oxidizes and is turning brown

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.200 
basically oxidizes and is turning brown
really<00:01:52.140> fast<00:01:52.470> so<00:01:53.220> that's<00:01:53.399> one<00:01:53.610> reason<00:01:53.820> why<00:01:54.149> you

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
really fast so that's one reason why you

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.179 
really fast so that's one reason why you
probably<00:01:54.720> never<00:01:54.840> seen<00:01:55.170> loquats<00:01:55.619> in<00:01:55.799> the<00:01:55.890> store

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
probably never seen loquats in the store

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.760 
probably never seen loquats in the store
is<00:01:56.430> because<00:01:57.090> once<00:01:57.360> you<00:01:57.509> pick<00:01:57.750> them<00:01:57.960> they<00:01:58.560> go

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
is because once you pick them they go

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.080 
is because once you pick them they go
bad<00:01:58.950> really<00:01:59.219> fast<00:01:59.340> especially

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
bad really fast especially

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.179 
bad really fast especially
they're<00:02:00.210> single<00:02:00.659> and<00:02:00.869> separate<00:02:01.649> so<00:02:02.070> if<00:02:02.159> you

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
they're single and separate so if you

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:03.980 
they're single and separate so if you
are<00:02:02.460> taking<00:02:02.850> these<00:02:02.969> and<00:02:03.270> buying<00:02:03.509> these<00:02:03.719> you

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
are taking these and buying these you

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.779 
are taking these and buying these you
want<00:02:04.140> to<00:02:04.200> try<00:02:04.350> to<00:02:04.409> pick<00:02:04.649> them<00:02:04.799> and<00:02:05.009> buy<00:02:05.460> them<00:02:05.490> on

00:02:05.779 --> 00:02:05.789 
want to try to pick them and buy them on

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:07.700 
want to try to pick them and buy them on
the<00:02:05.820> branch<00:02:06.179> much<00:02:06.450> like<00:02:06.719> buying<00:02:07.140> Tomatoes<00:02:07.350> on

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
the branch much like buying Tomatoes on

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.320 
the branch much like buying Tomatoes on
the<00:02:07.799> volume<00:02:08.160> they're<00:02:08.640> going<00:02:08.789> to<00:02:08.849> stay<00:02:09.000> fresher

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
the volume they're going to stay fresher

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.119 
the volume they're going to stay fresher
a<00:02:09.629> little<00:02:09.989> bit<00:02:10.110> longer<00:02:10.319> but<00:02:10.500> that<00:02:10.679> thing<00:02:10.890> said

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
a little bit longer but that thing said

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:12.770 
a little bit longer but that thing said
they<00:02:11.250> have<00:02:11.340> a<00:02:11.400> relatively<00:02:11.849> short<00:02:12.180> shelf<00:02:12.660> life

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
they have a relatively short shelf life

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:14.990 
they have a relatively short shelf life
so<00:02:13.530> they<00:02:13.680> don't<00:02:13.920> ship<00:02:14.160> well<00:02:14.400> so<00:02:14.610> unless<00:02:14.849> you

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
so they don't ship well so unless you

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.309 
so they don't ship well so unless you
live<00:02:15.150> in<00:02:15.180> a<00:02:15.330> place<00:02:15.510> where<00:02:15.750> there's<00:02:15.930> a<00:02:16.019> farmers

live in a place where there's a farmers

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:19.130 
live in a place where there's a farmers
market<00:02:16.379> or<00:02:16.890> you<00:02:17.400> could<00:02:17.519> grow<00:02:17.700> a<00:02:17.730> tree<00:02:18.140> you're

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
market or you could grow a tree you're

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:20.890 
market or you could grow a tree you're
probably<00:02:19.319> never<00:02:19.530> going<00:02:19.739> to<00:02:19.799> be<00:02:19.860> able<00:02:19.950> to<00:02:20.069> enjoy

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:20.900 
probably never going to be able to enjoy

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:23.270 
probably never going to be able to enjoy
local<00:02:21.900> on<00:02:22.140> fruits<00:02:22.440> they<00:02:22.560> have<00:02:22.650> a<00:02:22.680> nice<00:02:22.890> flavor

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
local on fruits they have a nice flavor

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.430 
local on fruits they have a nice flavor
you<00:02:23.760> want<00:02:23.910> to<00:02:24.060> get<00:02:24.180> them<00:02:24.269> as<00:02:24.390> dark<00:02:24.690> as<00:02:24.900> possible

can see the pits coming out here in the
pole<00:04:59.550> so<00:05:00.550> the<00:05:00.669> pits<00:05:00.910> while<00:05:01.120> they<00:05:01.210> aren't<00:05:01.419> being
