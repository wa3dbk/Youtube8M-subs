00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.220
 What do you think will happen to your three children was the first 

00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:04.990
 contracted to weight of fine gold 

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:06.370
 I think we have to do it. 

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:08.559
 Let's put the ideas back in touch 

00:00:08.559 --> 00:00:11.559
 for interest in embryonic stem cells 

00:00:13.189 --> 00:00:14.289
 they 

00:00:14.289 --> 00:00:16.839
 allow us to clarify 

00:00:16.839 --> 00:00:19.650
 how are we ready and differentiate 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.560
 the dialogue its collections are easy to understand then in banks 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:24.349
 with one voice 

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:25.689
 I remember guilty 

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:28.319
 the national strength of the patient 

00:00:28.319 --> 00:00:31.659
 we can not clear all types of fabric 

00:00:31.659 --> 00:00:34.659
 mason associate employees 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:37.820
 a book that would go in its first chapter 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:41.070
 If I did not get my first chapter, it would be very difficult to 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:42.190
 understand the case 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:44.420
 so far favorable 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:47.800
 In fact, Brazilian law is a law that he 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:48.920
 he warns 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:50.510
 fundamentally allow 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:52.730
 that you do your research 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:54.540
 with a lawn at best 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:58.960
 because I have no biological future they are the banana of the amounts in the 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:01.430
 world 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:02.810
 first because they were not 

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:03.970
 used 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:06.220
 it is a process can be assisted in bringing a train 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:09.240
 but a viability they do not have a better future 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.630
 in the forest ii and cutting did not do what was called the opponent in the therapy 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:14.340
 cell phone 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:15.840
 it's important to understand 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.080
 that struck are Pedro / are important at that moment 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.150
 to understand how in the future we manipulate the muse the trunks can 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:24.670
 allow acceleration 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:27.480
 in the case of research 

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:31.200
 another thing that he would have important and of synop gives team 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.369
 there are alternatives 

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:36.360
 but they are still not the proper say 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.670
 to solve the problems 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.469
 the science journal that showed 

00:01:40.469 --> 00:01:44.939
 in a next to you notisa a room with a billionaire consoles of the skin 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:49.420
 the narration of the facts authors December but that is to introduce the general victory 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:52.030
 then it will adapt to how 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:55.560
 of this touch magazine number and the black thunder would always have to be the last 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:56.930
 journal number 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:58.790
 and was not effective was chosen 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:02.500
 I found it interesting that shows how we go all the different 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:03.340
 medicines 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:07.250
 genetically they are not from there without thinking and therefore the debate 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:08.759
 of this important type 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.659
 jeferson henrique prada 

00:02:10.659 --> 00:02:13.399
 it fundamentally warns 

00:02:13.399 --> 00:02:16.369
 that you do your research 

00:02:16.369 --> 00:02:17.409
 embryos 

00:02:17.409 --> 00:02:22.709
 who does not have a glorious future they are in the banana of the amounts in 1 to 1 

00:02:24.169 --> 00:02:25.680
 first because they were not 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:29.089
 used is a process can watch singers yesterday 

00:02:29.089 --> 00:02:32.099
 one more viability they do not have a future north 

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:35.530
 I think it's very important not to do what you call it. 

00:02:35.529 --> 00:02:38.529
 embryonic stem cells 

00:02:40.029 --> 00:02:42.599
 allow us to clarify 

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:45.399
 how are we ready and differentiate 

00:02:45.399 --> 00:02:48.249
 the dialogue its collections easily obtainable 

00:02:48.249 --> 00:02:49.290
 then in banks 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:51.429
 as action 12 I remember guilt 

00:02:51.429 --> 00:02:54.039
 the national strength of the patient 

00:02:54.039 --> 00:02:57.409
 we could not generate all kinds of fabric 

00:02:57.409 --> 00:02:59.779
 messina to satiate employees 

00:02:59.779 --> 00:03:01.429
 be 

00:03:01.429 --> 00:03:03.559
 the book what this is the first chapter 

00:03:03.559 --> 00:03:06.819
 If I did not get my first chapter, it would be very difficult to 

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:07.869
 understand the case 

00:03:07.869 --> 00:03:10.159
 so far favorable 

00:03:10.159 --> 00:03:12.029
 by Brazilian law 

00:03:12.029 --> 00:03:13.160
 is one produced 

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:15.479
 and the way in the eyes 

00:03:15.479 --> 00:03:18.709
 we know if the patient answered is not a therapy 

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:21.049
 seeing the genome project it is used today 

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:23.449
 in medicine 

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:26.219
 there is a genomic medicine not granted 

00:03:26.219 --> 00:03:28.089
 All in all 

00:03:28.089 --> 00:03:32.699
 the pressure that there was the time I had stopped there these searches 

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:35.790
 we would be in a difficult situation today 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:38.389
 in several areas such as vaccine history 

00:03:38.389 --> 00:03:39.699
 I think here to me 

00:03:39.699 --> 00:03:41.219
 same situation 

00:03:41.219 --> 00:03:44.579
 we are at a time when there is this room are important 

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:47.479
 this is very important for developing 

00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:49.439
 certain knowledge 

00:03:49.439 --> 00:03:51.179
 Who's going to ISI? 

00:03:51.179 --> 00:03:53.289
 to generate new therapies 

00:03:53.289 --> 00:03:56.099
 The issue that is under debate in Brazil 

00:03:56.099 --> 00:03:59.099
 I think the dose found 

00:04:01.059 --> 00:04:05.239
 we can not direct society by what a scientist is a 

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:06.369
 technocracy 

00:04:06.369 --> 00:04:08.949
 mentor of a particle claiming to be a 

00:04:08.949 --> 00:04:11.949
 mathew quÃ©rcia what is expected is a common sense 

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:15.569
 now it's very important 

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:16.709
 we see 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:20.640
 in this evolutionary process of science and if dialogue 

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:25.240
 with what remained static presence is intrinsically modified 

00:04:26.189 --> 00:04:29.090
 we arrived revolutionary being decent 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:30.250
 the bus had to do 

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:33.150
 but recovery seems to have hit but it is important that society 

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:36.460
 Brazilian realize what this debate wants 

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:39.460
 in all surveys they are occurring in the world 

00:04:40.569 --> 00:04:45.430
 the goal of all and after the bullet with stamps easy to use months 

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:47.830
 you work with embryonic stem cells moment 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:49.779
 because we need them 

00:04:49.779 --> 00:04:52.439
 there are some steps in this process 

00:04:52.439 --> 00:04:55.749
 they will occur and this will be the third glory mission 

00:04:55.749 --> 00:04:59.509
 As it was said very well the problem she could only have to be Pope 

00:04:59.509 --> 00:05:02.289
 This whole story is not played in Brazil. 

00:05:02.289 --> 00:05:03.199
 or will be 

00:05:03.199 --> 00:05:07.270
 why is not everyone in china in concentration korea united states 

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:11.379
 because the common state funds the caliphate and allocated 3 billion 

00:05:11.379 --> 00:05:12.430
 dollars this year 

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:15.370
 then it would happen anyway 

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:16.969
 so we need to see 

00:05:16.969 --> 00:05:19.969
 what is at stake here is the question of the lay state 

00:05:20.639 --> 00:05:23.460
 interesting tarar 

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:25.779
 Is there a standard in Brazil? 

00:05:25.779 --> 00:05:27.610
 but cindy consensus 

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:30.400
 that after three years the holy citizens' freedom 

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:32.059
 before falling 

00:05:32.059 --> 00:05:35.550
 that after four years the clinics will be 

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:38.550
 may not be discarded 

00:05:39.319 --> 00:05:40.439
 this discussion 

00:05:40.439 --> 00:05:42.620
 in a country like Sweden 

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:45.180
 92% of the embryos in this situation 

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:47.159
 are donated voluntarily 

00:05:47.159 --> 00:05:50.259
 by parents for research 

00:05:50.259 --> 00:05:51.770
 mayors 

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:54.059
 the question is the following to spread 

00:05:54.059 --> 00:05:57.619
 it seems that they are important for studies of cell differentiation 

00:05:58.219 --> 00:05:59.839
 the commotion we have made 

00:05:59.839 --> 00:06:01.559
 the expression 

00:06:01.559 --> 00:06:04.539
 charisma of turning on and off genes 

00:06:04.539 --> 00:06:08.490
 when receiving the first chapter said then accept important results 

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:10.490
 about this process 

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:12.240
 the therapy 

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:14.680
 the remaining people 

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:18.119
 the games are made consolation products is important to explain 

00:06:18.119 --> 00:06:20.290
 importance of the locked room in the 

00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:24.490
 she is in the study in understanding the mechanisms that will allow 

00:06:25.219 --> 00:06:27.110
 the lower control of stem cells 

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:30.020
 we also do not know if by certain therapies 

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:33.740
 will have to be resort to sanction that my nose but that's not the point here 

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:38.260
 the importance of this material for researches that are currently 

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:42.139
 beyond the gerdau 

00:06:42.139 --> 00:06:45.139
 he thinks that China also in the chapter the newborn 

00:06:47.199 --> 00:06:48.839
 the website is going to happen 

00:06:48.839 --> 00:06:49.979
 it's a question 

00:06:49.979 --> 00:06:54.479
 the u2 will dispute it the question the animals were planetary scale 

00:06:54.479 --> 00:06:57.719
 they can not be adopted pimpinoni societies 

00:06:59.389 --> 00:07:00.819
 it's very heterogeneous 

00:07:00.819 --> 00:07:02.300
 If you try opinions 

00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:04.220
 hehehe in many religions 

00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:07.740
 and many people, but it is an exemplary secular state at the 

00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:08.569
 exceptions 

00:07:08.569 --> 00:07:11.719
 defeated the trading discard of swedish wheels which is a given 

00:07:11.719 --> 00:07:12.639
 proven 

00:07:12.639 --> 00:07:16.250
 I think that this is not the point the most important point this posture 

00:07:18.629 --> 00:07:21.550
 henry we had here what was the moratorium 

00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:24.789
 you can collect the houses or sunbathe in that area during 

00:07:24.789 --> 00:07:27.919
 a decade now its defense the shows
