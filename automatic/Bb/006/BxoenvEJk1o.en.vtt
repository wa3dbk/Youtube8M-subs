it was way off from Journal - Jeremy no
I<00:00:41.769> went<00:00:42.039> back<00:00:42.250> and<00:00:42.460> double-checked<00:00:43.030> it<00:00:44.879> 90

00:00:45.869 --> 00:00:45.879

degrees was 90 degrees than 90 degrees
to<00:00:49.749> the<00:00:49.839> next<00:00:50.140> one<00:00:50.320> and<00:00:50.820> so<00:00:51.820> on<00:00:52.079> and<00:00:53.079> even<00:00:53.320> when

00:00:53.549 --> 00:00:53.559 
to the next one and so on and even when

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:58.619 
to the next one and so on and even when
I<00:00:53.589> put<00:00:54.579> it<00:00:54.699> back<00:00:54.730> in<00:00:56.219> finish<00:00:57.219> grinding<00:00:57.629> it

00:00:58.619 --> 00:00:58.629 
I put it back in finish grinding it

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:02.189 
I put it back in finish grinding it
still<00:00:59.019> showed<00:00:59.260> up<00:00:59.699> as<00:01:00.699> right<00:01:01.120> on<00:01:01.300> to<00:01:01.690> the<00:01:01.809> index

00:01:02.189 --> 00:01:02.199 
still showed up as right on to the index

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:04.320 
still showed up as right on to the index
on<00:01:02.440> the<00:01:02.559> checks<00:01:02.999> yeah<00:01:03.999> I'm<00:01:04.089> being<00:01:04.210> a<00:01:04.300> little

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:04.330 
on the checks yeah I'm being a little

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:06.360 
on the checks yeah I'm being a little
distracted<00:01:05.050> by<00:01:05.140> the<00:01:05.199> cat<00:01:05.500> here<00:01:05.770> she<00:01:05.980> wants

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:06.370 
distracted by the cat here she wants

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:06.950 
distracted by the cat here she wants
attention

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
attention

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.069 
attention
anyway<00:01:07.960> just<00:01:08.770> thought<00:01:08.890> I'd<00:01:09.060> double<00:01:10.060> check<00:01:10.810> in

00:01:11.069 --> 00:01:11.079 
anyway just thought I'd double check in

00:01:11.079 --> 00:01:18.569 
anyway just thought I'd double check in
the<00:01:11.380> block<00:01:12.119> to<00:01:13.119> see<00:01:13.540> if<00:01:15.540> you<00:01:16.540> know<00:01:16.920> when<00:01:17.920> I<00:01:17.950> find

00:01:18.569 --> 00:01:18.579 
the block to see if you know when I find

00:01:18.579 --> 00:01:20.370 
the block to see if you know when I find
top<00:01:18.939> dead<00:01:19.180> center<00:01:19.509> absolutely<00:01:20.020> top<00:01:20.170> dead

00:01:23.249 --> 00:01:23.259 
center on one cylinder that would be the

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:26.370 
center on one cylinder that would be the
same<00:01:23.500> on<00:01:23.710> all<00:01:23.829> the<00:01:23.979> others<00:01:25.079> so<00:01:26.079> what<00:01:26.170> I've<00:01:26.290> done

is I got the positive stop here we've
already<00:01:29.979> found<00:01:30.189> top<00:01:30.490> dead<00:01:30.729> center<00:01:31.030> for<00:01:31.180> number

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:31.360 
already found top dead center for number

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:35.490 
already found top dead center for number
one<00:01:32.009> we're<00:01:33.009> showing<00:01:33.039> right<00:01:33.909> at<00:01:34.360> 44<00:01:35.079> and<00:01:35.110> a<00:01:35.259> half

have to use parts from other engines
okay

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:24.260 
okay

now let's bring this up this one should

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:30.830 
now let's bring this up this one should
be<00:02:26.850> a<00:02:26.970> hundred<00:02:27.180> and<00:02:27.390> eighty<00:02:27.780> off<00:02:29.209> stops<00:02:30.209> and

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
be a hundred and eighty off stops and

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:37.340 
be a hundred and eighty off stops and
we're<00:02:31.050> at<00:02:31.170> 140<00:02:32.130> exactly<00:02:35.900> come<00:02:36.900> back<00:02:37.110> around

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:37.350 
we're at 140 exactly come back around

00:03:59.850 --> 00:03:59.860 
and over right at 47 so so far we're

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:21.660 
and over right at 47 so so far we're
doing<00:03:59.890> pretty<00:04:00.220> good

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:21.670 

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:24.490 

we're<00:04:22.670> at<00:04:22.760> 140<00:04:23.450> again<00:04:23.690> that<00:04:23.900> we're<00:04:24.020> we're<00:04:24.170> on

140 on the other side

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:28.240 
140 on the other side
it<00:04:26.330> stops<00:04:26.570> not<00:04:26.780> going<00:04:26.930> to<00:04:26.990> be<00:04:27.080> perfect<00:04:27.920> but

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:28.250 
it stops not going to be perfect but

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:35.520 
it stops not going to be perfect but
it's<00:04:28.400> long<00:04:28.580> as<00:04:28.790> it<00:04:28.940> checks<00:04:29.300> both<00:04:29.600> ways<00:04:32.950> at<00:04:33.950> 140

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:35.530 
it's long as it checks both ways at 140

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:39.400 
it's long as it checks both ways at 140
okay<00:04:36.530> so<00:04:36.590> what<00:04:36.830> I<00:04:36.860> found<00:04:37.130> out<00:04:37.430> here<00:04:37.790> the<00:04:38.570> 90

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:39.410

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:21.159 

fortunately<00:05:18.680> I'm<00:05:18.890> grinding<00:05:19.550> 180<00:05:20.419> thousands

00:05:21.159 --> 00:05:21.169 
fortunately I'm grinding 180 thousands

fortunately I'm grinding 180 thousands
off<00:05:21.380> of<00:05:21.560> each<00:05:21.710> journal<00:05:22.340> so<00:05:22.550> it<00:05:22.669> gave<00:05:22.820> me<00:05:22.970> a<00:05:23.000> lot

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:23.180 
off of each journal so it gave me a lot

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:26.830 
off of each journal so it gave me a lot
of<00:05:23.210> leeway<00:05:23.620> to<00:05:24.620> straighten<00:05:25.550> it<00:05:25.610> up<00:05:25.780> now<00:05:26.780> it

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:26.840 
of leeway to straighten it up now it

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:29.080 
of leeway to straighten it up now it
just<00:05:26.870> goes<00:05:27.140> to<00:05:27.290> show<00:05:27.470> either<00:05:27.860> how<00:05:28.070> sloppy<00:05:28.490> the

just goes to show either how sloppy the

just goes to show either how sloppy the
cranks<00:05:29.479> are<00:05:29.600> made<00:05:29.780> at<00:05:29.960> the<00:05:30.080> factory<00:05:30.680> or<00:05:31.280> the

cranks are made at the factory or the
fact<00:05:32.360> that<00:05:32.419> they<00:05:32.600> twist<00:05:32.930> a<00:05:33.110> little<00:05:33.140> bit<00:05:33.530> over
