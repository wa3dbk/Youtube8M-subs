 we need to be prepared to know 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:30.659
 manipulate all the information so that 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:32.670
 this child is still being 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:35.039
 developing its path so that the 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.860
 people not ready to bring her things 

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:41.940
 outside her reality for example 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:44.130

 a booklet but today we need 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:49.890
 know that we are mediators one 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:54.289
 learning process that requires 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:54.289
 much more skill of us teachers 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:06.790

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:09.670
 strengthening us in the knowledge to 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:11.410
 not to get behind the knowledge to 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:12.250
 children behind the development of 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:14.590

 What are you missing, and constantly 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:38.760
