00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:28.310 
things as many times I noticed that
while<00:01:27.330> sniping<00:01:27.750> and<00:01:27.840> everything<00:01:28.110> like<00:01:28.260> that

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
while sniping and everything like that

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.410 
while sniping and everything like that
it<00:01:28.560> was<00:01:28.650> a<00:01:28.680> clear<00:01:28.920> obvious<00:01:29.340> head<00:01:29.490> shot<00:01:29.760> or<00:01:29.970> any

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
it was a clear obvious head shot or any

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:31.430 
it was a clear obvious head shot or any
sort<00:01:30.600> of<00:01:30.750> shot<00:01:30.960> and<00:01:31.080> it<00:01:31.140> just<00:01:31.290> seemed<00:01:31.410> like

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:31.440 
sort of shot and it just seemed like

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:32.840 
sort of shot and it just seemed like
sometimes<00:01:31.890> things<00:01:32.190> just<00:01:32.280> didn't<00:01:32.700> register

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
sometimes things just didn't register

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.150 
sometimes things just didn't register
properly<00:01:33.510> but<00:01:34.050> the<00:01:34.170> game<00:01:34.350> was<00:01:34.560> great<00:01:34.740> I<00:01:34.830> loved

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:35.160 
properly but the game was great I loved

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:36.560 
properly but the game was great I loved
how<00:01:35.250> everything<00:01:35.610> worked<00:01:35.820> out<00:01:36.030> I<00:01:36.090> think<00:01:36.480> there

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
how everything worked out I think there

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.240 
how everything worked out I think there
was<00:01:36.660> a<00:01:36.720> nice<00:01:36.870> balance<00:01:37.230> pace<00:01:37.590> but<00:01:37.770> above<00:01:38.010> all<00:01:38.190> it

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
was a nice balance pace but above all it

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:39.860 
was a nice balance pace but above all it
was<00:01:38.490> the<00:01:38.610> maps<00:01:38.850> that<00:01:39.030> made<00:01:39.210> this<00:01:39.330> game<00:01:39.420> stand

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:39.870 
was the maps that made this game stand

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:53.100 
that but it doesn't mean you can't do it

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:55.280 
that but it doesn't mean you can't do it
at<00:03:53.280> the<00:03:53.490> odd<00:03:53.580> feeling<00:03:54.120> is<00:03:54.270> that<00:03:54.480> awkward
