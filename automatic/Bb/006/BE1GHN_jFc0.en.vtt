00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:16.690
 in my name and dreamer and from this 

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:18.490
 invited guest choreographer team in 

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:20.800
 conservatory to tackle a piece 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:25.539
 During two weeks 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:26.859
 the title of the watch is a piece that has 

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:28.720
 sprung up a little inspiration from another 

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:32.520
 piece created a year ago that 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:34.730
 they call double and now the idea is a bit 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.800
 the surreal character 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:39.980
 of the characters that appear in the 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:42.710
 Piece the step are now like 18 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:44.329
 dancers who are the 5th grade and 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:46.070
 good has been two weeks very intensive 

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:48.940
 but wonderful because also with the 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:52.720
 opportunity to work as a dancer 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:52.720
 of the brothers 

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:26.710
 during the creation of the pieces in a 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:29.290
 very short period two weeks and I think that 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:32.500
 with the students has been very intensive and 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:35.260
 now because it's a challenge for both 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:37.510
 them as for me as far as I 

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:39.570
 I think that adapt to my way of 

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:42.790
 move because I have given all the material 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:45.820
 has achieved this different kind of style 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:48.760
 of dance for them and for me a little 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:51.700
 also have both to spin ine or 18 

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:56.790
 dancers create that everyone can 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:56.790
 participate and a little exchange 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.610
 the students of the house 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:29.200
 we have created the piece they have been for me 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:35.830
 open to have new knowledge are 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:40.630

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:41.890
 feed on what he could give us very 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:44.260
 productive 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:46.770

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:50.280
