00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.009
 hello guys come back with another first 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:07.980
 printing and revise the lipstick today 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:10.590
 revlon called color state ultimate and the 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:13.230
 color that I have here is number 35 and 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:16.920
 it's called backstage I bought it in target 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:19.500
 by 850 or so and contains says that 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.939
 is an instant color moisturizer that 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.100
 daylong 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:25.590
 contains butters it is already soft 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:29.720
 soft finished and available mind 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.720
 everything I have nothing on my lips now 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:39.000
 and my lips are very dry as you can 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:39.000
 watch 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:45.000
 you know it feels very soft 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:02.010
 these are two to three layers and in 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.970
 I really wanted a stronger color like 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.970
 the one seen in the labial 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.970
 if it actually shows much more 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:14.610
 light of what I anticipated and you have to 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:18.300
 put a lot of product because it seems that 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:20.760
 it's more a color that is built and it 

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:25.050
 feels good feels soft as 

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:27.750
 suede as he acclaims it so let's see if 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:29.760
 this really works all day not 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.700
 says how many hours it is supposed to last 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:35.939
 but we will see it 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:39.320
 or we want the time is 2 pm and 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:39.320
 I'll be back in a few hours 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:46.869
 so it's been several hours and they're 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:49.840
 641 pm and the labial is still on 

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:52.659
 when he laughed he definitely notes the 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:57.009
 moist parts of my lips like the ones 

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:58.899
 corners and you see that it fell a bit what 

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:00.570
 which is typical for long labials 

00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:03.090
 duration 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:05.450
 and also note that when you see beijing 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:08.090
 it was not transferred 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:10.099
 did not transfer at all in reality 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:12.349
 I'm happy with what this has lasted 

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:15.390
 product feels good and smooth in my 

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:18.990
 lips and still 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:20.819
 I feel that soft type consistency is not 

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:24.209
 moisturizer in the sense that it 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:26.970
 it feels like a butter but it 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:30.720
 It has dried but it is not drying me if it is 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:32.730
 that that makes sense I do not know until now 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:36.290
 I'm happy with the lipstick we'll see in 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:36.290
 a few hours at the end of the night 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:43.420
 it's the end of the night and now it's the 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:46.680
 11 20 pm and it really looks really good 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:49.270
 for the time it has been and 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:52.030
 I noticed that the inside parts are 

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:54.550
 starts to dry and I found myself taking off 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:58.570
 the bits and still removing the 

00:02:54.550 --> 00:03:01.780
 I want to say I still have 90% of my 

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:03.360
 lipstick and it did not fade or 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:07.230
 up or down 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:07.230
 let's see how it is removed 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:11.550
 I would recommend them to use 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:13.950
 make-up remover to remove it from another 

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:16.020
 way your lips will end up very dry 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:18.060
 when trying to remove it in this way 

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:21.000
 revlon you did a magnificent job 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:23.220
