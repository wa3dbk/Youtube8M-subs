00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
three colors blue red and yellow which

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.790 
three colors blue red and yellow which
are<00:00:50.910> the<00:00:51.000> primary<00:00:51.390> colors<00:00:51.780> so<00:00:52.380> that<00:00:52.410> way<00:00:52.740> you

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
are the primary colors so that way you

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.380 
are the primary colors so that way you
can<00:00:53.280> show<00:00:53.430> your<00:00:53.550> children<00:00:53.610> how<00:00:54.060> to<00:00:54.090> make

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
can show your children how to make

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.300

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:56.310 
secondary colors out of these three

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:59.240 
secondary colors out of these three
colors<00:00:56.790> so<00:00:57.060> it's<00:00:57.210> a<00:00:57.360> great<00:00:57.920> way<00:00:58.920> to<00:00:58.980> learn

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
colors so it's a great way to learn

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.330 
colors so it's a great way to learn
colors<00:00:59.640> and<00:01:00.150> the<00:01:00.630> how<00:01:01.620> they<00:01:01.770> change<00:01:02.040> when<00:01:02.280> you

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
colors and the how they change when you

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.539 
colors and the how they change when you
mix<00:01:02.460> them<00:01:02.550> together<00:01:02.700> so<00:01:03.480> here's<00:01:04.350> the<00:01:04.549> process

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
mix them together so here's the process

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.550 
mix them together so here's the process
will<00:01:06.299> show<00:01:06.450> you<00:01:06.659> right<00:01:06.780> now<00:01:06.840> all<00:01:06.960> you<00:01:07.200> need<00:01:07.259> for

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
there I'm going to whisk it and we'll

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:32.510 
there I'm going to whisk it and we'll
have<00:01:25.500> to<00:01:25.799> brave<00:01:26.610> this<00:01:26.790> mixture<00:01:27.750> to<00:01:28.049> a<00:01:28.080> boil<00:01:31.520> and

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
have to brave this mixture to a boil and

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.070 
have to brave this mixture to a boil and
once<00:01:32.700> it<00:01:32.940> boils<00:01:33.210> you're<00:01:33.659> going<00:01:33.840> to<00:01:33.930> keep

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:34.080 
once it boils you're going to keep

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:40.060 
once it boils you're going to keep
whisking<00:01:34.320> it<00:01:34.680> until<00:01:35.280> the<00:01:35.940> mixture<00:01:36.119> thickens

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:40.070 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:43.340 

soit's<00:01:41.070> boiling<00:01:41.580> and<00:01:42.090> it<00:01:42.690> literally<00:01:43.140> only

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
soit's boiling and it literally only

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.700 
soit's boiling and it literally only
took<00:01:43.619> about<00:01:43.770> two<00:01:44.760> minutes<00:01:44.940> and<00:01:45.570> see<00:01:46.500> that

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
took about two minutes and see that

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.620 
took about two minutes and see that
mixture<00:01:47.280> is<00:01:47.430> already<00:01:47.640> thick<00:01:47.880> in<00:01:48.060> so<00:01:48.420> you<00:01:48.510> can

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
mixture is already thick in so you can

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.330 
mixture is already thick in so you can
remove<00:01:48.990> it<00:01:49.049> from<00:01:49.200> the<00:01:49.290> heat<00:01:49.380> sorry<00:01:50.100> I'm

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
remove it from the heat sorry I'm

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.990 
remove it from the heat sorry I'm
holding<00:01:50.610> the<00:01:50.700> camera<00:01:50.909> with<00:01:51.090> the<00:01:51.119> other<00:01:51.299> hand

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:53.000 
holding the camera with the other hand

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.240 
holding the camera with the other hand
so<00:01:54.000> you<00:01:54.119> just<00:01:54.180> keep<00:01:55.020> whisking<00:01:55.260> it<00:01:55.590> until<00:01:56.159> you

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
so you just keep whisking it until you

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.320 
so you just keep whisking it until you
have<00:01:56.400> a<00:01:56.430> smooth<00:01:57.420> consistency<00:01:59.030> this<00:02:00.030> is<00:02:00.180> pretty

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:00.330 
have a smooth consistency this is pretty

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:03.710 
have a smooth consistency this is pretty
much<00:02:00.450> done<00:02:00.780> see<00:02:01.200> that<00:02:02.119> and<00:02:03.119> we'll<00:02:03.270> let<00:02:03.360> it<00:02:03.509> cool

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:03.720 
much done see that and we'll let it cool

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:05.539 
much done see that and we'll let it cool
for<00:02:03.780> a<00:02:04.110> little<00:02:04.229> bit<00:02:04.470> and<00:02:04.920> we'll<00:02:05.130> split<00:02:05.310> it<00:02:05.400> up

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
for a little bit and we'll split it up

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:09.229 
for a little bit and we'll split it up
on<00:02:05.700> our<00:02:06.860> little<00:02:07.860> cups<00:02:08.189> so<00:02:08.700> we<00:02:08.819> can<00:02:08.939> add<00:02:09.090> the

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
on our little cups so we can add the

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:12.050 
on our little cups so we can add the
food<00:02:09.390> coloring<00:02:09.810> so<00:02:10.679> now<00:02:10.799> that<00:02:10.830> the<00:02:11.159> mixture

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
food coloring so now that the mixture

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:12.809 
food coloring so now that the mixture
has<00:02:12.180> cool

00:02:12.809 --> 00:02:12.819 
has cool

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:14.729 
has cool
I<00:02:12.849> went<00:02:13.510> ahead<00:02:13.599> and<00:02:13.840> put<00:02:14.319> some<00:02:14.349> food<00:02:14.680> coloring

00:02:14.729 --> 00:02:14.739 
I went ahead and put some food coloring

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:17.580 
I went ahead and put some food coloring
in<00:02:15.189> these<00:02:15.340> little<00:02:15.609> cups<00:02:16.139> and<00:02:17.139> we're<00:02:17.409> just

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590 
in these little cups and we're just

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:21.390 
in these little cups and we're just
going<00:02:17.709> to<00:02:18.069> combine<00:02:18.400> it<00:02:18.639> together<00:02:19.709> so<00:02:20.709> I<00:02:21.219> think

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
going to combine it together so I think

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.780 
going to combine it together so I think
I<00:02:22.019> you<00:02:23.019> know<00:02:23.139> what<00:02:23.319> i<00:02:23.349> overcook<00:02:23.980> the<00:02:24.159> mixture<00:02:24.760> a

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790 
I you know what i overcook the mixture a

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:26.940 
I you know what i overcook the mixture a
little<00:02:25.090> bit<00:02:25.209> because<00:02:25.329> it's<00:02:25.599> kind<00:02:25.780> of<00:02:25.870> lumpy<00:02:26.499> I

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
little bit because it's kind of lumpy I

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:30.059 
little bit because it's kind of lumpy I
noticed<00:02:27.609> that<00:02:27.819> so<00:02:28.239> once<00:02:29.109> on<00:02:29.409> the<00:02:29.769> mixture

00:02:30.059 --> 00:02:30.069 
noticed that so once on the mixture

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:31.369 
noticed that so once on the mixture
thickens<00:02:30.250> you<00:02:30.489> got<00:02:30.639> to<00:02:30.760> get<00:02:30.879> it<00:02:30.969> off<00:02:31.090> the

00:02:31.369 --> 00:02:31.379 
thickens you got to get it off the

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:34.170 
thickens you got to get it off the
burner<00:02:32.379> get<00:02:33.129> it<00:02:33.219> off<00:02:33.340> the<00:02:33.489> heat<00:02:33.700> as<00:02:33.939> soon<00:02:34.060> as

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
burner get it off the heat as soon as

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:36.449 
burner get it off the heat as soon as
possible<00:02:34.719> but<00:02:35.319> you<00:02:35.439> know<00:02:35.560> what<00:02:35.769> this<00:02:36.099> is<00:02:36.250> not

00:02:36.449 --> 00:02:36.459

have another channel it's also learn to

00:03:45.129 --> 00:03:47.240 
have another channel it's also learn to
grow<00:03:45.310> its<00:03:45.579> the<00:03:45.699> first<00:03:45.879> channel<00:03:46.180> that<00:03:46.599> I
