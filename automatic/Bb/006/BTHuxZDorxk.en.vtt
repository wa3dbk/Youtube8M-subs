got the idea

00:06:38.729 --> 00:06:41.039 
got the idea
start<00:06:39.729> off<00:06:39.849> by<00:06:40.059> going<00:06:40.179> really<00:06:40.479> slow<00:06:40.809> when<00:06:40.989> you

00:06:41.039 --> 00:06:41.049 
start off by going really slow when you

00:06:41.049 --> 00:06:42.509 
start off by going really slow when you
start<00:06:41.259> to<00:06:41.349> mix<00:06:41.529> your<00:06:41.709> left<00:06:41.919> and<00:06:42.009> right<00:06:42.069> hand<00:06:42.189> in

start to mix your left and right hand in
together<00:06:42.779> it<00:06:43.779> took<00:06:43.959> me<00:06:44.110> a<00:06:44.139> while<00:06:44.289> to<00:06:44.349> get<00:06:44.559> it

00:06:44.639 --> 00:06:44.649 
together it took me a while to get it

00:06:44.649 --> 00:06:47.789 
together it took me a while to get it
down<00:06:45.569> let's<00:06:46.569> just<00:06:46.749> practice<00:06:47.139> a<00:06:47.409> lot<00:06:47.529> and

00:06:47.789 --> 00:06:47.799 
down let's just practice a lot and

00:06:47.799 --> 00:06:50.879 
down let's just practice a lot and
you'll<00:06:47.979> eventually<00:06:48.489> get<00:06:48.819> it<00:06:49.499> but<00:06:50.499> as<00:06:50.739> I<00:06:50.829> said

00:06:50.879 --> 00:06:50.889 
you'll eventually get it but as I said

00:06:50.889 --> 00:06:53.549 
you'll eventually get it but as I said
start<00:06:51.369> slow<00:06:51.669> don't<00:06:52.419> try<00:06:52.629> to<00:06:52.689> go<00:06:52.809> too<00:06:52.869> faster<00:06:53.439> at

00:06:53.549 --> 00:06:53.559 
start slow don't try to go too faster at

00:06:53.559 --> 00:06:55.619 
start slow don't try to go too faster at
the<00:06:53.619> normal<00:06:53.889> speed<00:06:53.919> or<00:06:54.819> start<00:06:55.059> as<00:06:55.179> slow<00:06:55.389> as<00:06:55.539> you

00:06:55.619 --> 00:06:55.629 
the normal speed or start as slow as you
