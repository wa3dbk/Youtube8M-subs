because<00:01:09.820> could<00:01:10.660> be<00:01:10.810> offending<00:01:12.300> but<00:01:13.300> that

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:13.630 
because could be offending but that

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:15.930 
because could be offending but that
seems<00:01:13.900> real<00:01:14.140> hypocritical<00:01:14.860> because<00:01:15.010> if<00:01:15.610> you

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:15.940 
seems real hypocritical because if you

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:18.360 
seems real hypocritical because if you
don't<00:01:16.000> have<00:01:16.150> to<00:01:16.300> say<00:01:16.330> it<00:01:16.480> y<00:01:16.750> con<00:01:17.020> someone<00:01:17.830> who's

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:18.370 
don't have to say it y con someone who's

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:20.670 
don't have to say it y con someone who's
just<00:01:18.520> a<00:01:18.700> lighter<00:01:19.030> skin<00:01:19.810> tone<00:01:20.050> will<00:01:20.230> ever<00:01:20.380> say

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:20.680 
just a lighter skin tone will ever say

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:23.220 
just a lighter skin tone will ever say
it<00:01:20.910> just<00:01:21.910> because<00:01:22.060> like<00:01:22.540> maybe<00:01:22.840> if<00:01:23.050> their

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:23.230 
it just because like maybe if their

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:26.130 
it just because like maybe if their
ancestors<00:01:23.890> even<00:01:24.310> wear<00:01:24.550> sleeve<00:01:25.330> on<00:01:25.540> this<00:01:25.750> it

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:26.140 
ancestors even wear sleeve on this it

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:28.650 
ancestors even wear sleeve on this it
doesn't<00:01:26.470> mean<00:01:26.590> that<00:01:26.620> they<00:01:27.070> are<00:01:27.300> songs<00:01:28.300> why

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:28.660 
doesn't mean that they are songs why

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:31.350 
doesn't mean that they are songs why
they<00:01:28.840> can't<00:01:29.080> use<00:01:29.200> it<00:01:29.640> but<00:01:30.640> I<00:01:30.970> don't<00:01:31.210> even<00:01:31.270> think

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:31.360 
they can't use it but I don't even think

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:34.500 
they can't use it but I don't even think
it<00:01:31.540> should<00:01:31.660> be<00:01:31.690> used<00:01:32.010> the<00:01:33.010> way<00:01:33.190> it<00:01:33.310> is<00:01:33.510> because

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:34.510 
it should be used the way it is because

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:37.380 
it should be used the way it is because
if<00:01:35.260> you're<00:01:35.530> about<00:01:35.710> to<00:01:35.920> it's<00:01:36.190> like<00:01:36.490> I'm<00:01:37.150> black

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:37.390

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:31.390 
think that in the future I think not

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:33.810 
think that in the future I think not
like<00:03:31.600> 20<00:03:32.200> years<00:03:32.320> 30<00:03:32.620> years<00:03:32.770> I<00:03:32.950> mean<00:03:33.130> like<00:03:33.280> five

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:33.820 
like 20 years 30 years I mean like five

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:38.100 
like 20 years 30 years I mean like five
maybe<00:03:34.150> ten<00:03:34.390> years<00:03:34.570> or<00:03:34.690> not<00:03:34.840> um<00:03:35.470> I<00:03:36.780> think<00:03:37.780> the

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:38.110 
maybe ten years or not um I think the

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:41.940 
maybe ten years or not um I think the
use<00:03:38.320> of<00:03:38.350> is<00:03:38.680> going<00:03:38.890> to<00:03:38.980> be<00:03:39.690> to<00:03:40.690> slow<00:03:41.470> down<00:03:41.620> a<00:03:41.680> lot

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:41.950 
use of is going to be to slow down a lot

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:44.580 
use of is going to be to slow down a lot
because<00:03:42.310> the<00:03:42.370> whole<00:03:42.790> I<00:03:43.000> this<00:03:43.240> thing<00:03:43.510> like<00:03:44.290> I

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:44.590 
because the whole I this thing like I

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:46.980 
because the whole I this thing like I
don't<00:03:45.490> know<00:03:45.670> why<00:03:45.850> that<00:03:45.880> people<00:03:46.630> just<00:03:46.780> don't

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:46.990

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:49.560 
don't know why that people just don't
understand<00:03:47.380> like<00:03:47.470> how<00:03:48.060> stupid<00:03:49.060> it<00:03:49.150> sounds<00:03:49.180> if

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:49.570 
understand like how stupid it sounds if

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:51.990 
understand like how stupid it sounds if

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:12.720 
this close they're so quick overview I

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:16.020 
this close they're so quick overview I
think<00:04:13.720> that<00:04:13.840> term<00:04:14.620> the<00:04:15.280> n-word<00:04:15.610> shouldn't<00:04:15.940> be

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:16.030 
think that term the n-word shouldn't be

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:19.590 
think that term the n-word shouldn't be
used<00:04:16.270> if<00:04:17.049> you're<00:04:17.950> black<00:04:18.280> and<00:04:18.609> you<00:04:19.120> use<00:04:19.330> the

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:19.600 
used if you're black and you use the

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:23.100 
used if you're black and you use the
n-word<00:04:19.810> I<00:04:20.230> think<00:04:20.890> that's<00:04:21.040> wrong<00:04:21.310> because<00:04:22.110> if

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:23.110 
n-word I think that's wrong because if

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:23.910 
n-word I think that's wrong because if
you<00:04:23.290> don't<00:04:23.410> know<00:04:23.590> where

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:23.920
