00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
the in the in the season but as as it

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:11.630 
the in the in the season but as as it
goes<00:02:10.500> now<00:02:10.679> like<00:02:10.920> I'm<00:02:11.129> just<00:02:11.250> trying<00:02:11.459> to<00:02:11.489> have<00:02:11.610> a

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
goes now like I'm just trying to have a

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.790 
goes now like I'm just trying to have a
lens<00:02:11.879> from<00:02:12.239> when<00:02:12.810> they<00:02:12.900> call<00:02:13.050> up

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
lens from when they call up

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.920 
lens from when they call up
ok<00:02:14.490> so<00:02:14.790> then<00:02:14.910> actually<00:02:15.210> it's<00:02:15.360> a<00:02:15.480> pass<00:02:15.720> for<00:02:15.900> a

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
ok so then actually it's a pass for a

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:17.630 
ok so then actually it's a pass for a
little<00:02:16.020> bit<00:02:16.140> in<00:02:16.290> the<00:02:16.380> game<00:02:16.500> to<00:02:16.830> the<00:02:17.280> first<00:02:17.490> of

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
little bit in the game to the first of

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.520 
little bit in the game to the first of
many<00:02:17.700> or<00:02:17.970> I<00:02:18.210> guess<00:02:18.450> one<00:02:18.660> of<00:02:18.780> many<00:02:18.930> Baron<00:02:19.290> fights

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
many or I guess one of many Baron fights

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.380 
many or I guess one of many Baron fights
this<00:02:19.710> is<00:02:19.800> one<00:02:19.980> where<00:02:20.490> you<00:02:20.610> get<00:02:20.820> i<00:02:20.850> believe<00:02:21.240> it's

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
this is one where you get i believe it's

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:22.880 
this is one where you get i believe it's
to<00:02:21.540> catch<00:02:21.720> that<00:02:21.750> we<00:02:22.170> can<00:02:22.290> pull<00:02:22.410> the<00:02:22.470> replay<00:02:22.740> up

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
to catch that we can pull the replay up

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:24.950 
to catch that we can pull the replay up

altec<00:03:06.150> I'd<00:03:06.420> kill<00:03:06.900> myself<00:03:06.930> to<00:03:07.350> kill<00:03:07.530> him<00:03:07.710> but<00:03:07.980> it

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:08.490 
altec I'd kill myself to kill him but it

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:10.610 
altec I'd kill myself to kill him but it
was<00:03:08.610> really<00:03:08.790> it<00:03:09.090> was<00:03:09.120> the<00:03:09.270> last<00:03:09.540> ignite<00:03:10.020> tix<00:03:10.380> so

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
was really it was the last ignite tix so

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:12.290 
was really it was the last ignite tix so
I'm<00:03:10.860> not<00:03:11.070> sure<00:03:11.220> I<00:03:11.370> was<00:03:11.460> worth<00:03:11.580> it<00:03:11.640> either<00:03:11.760> but<00:03:12.030> I

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:12.300 
I'm not sure I was worth it either but I

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:13.790 
I'm not sure I was worth it either but I
think<00:03:12.660> after<00:03:12.780> killing<00:03:13.080> krepo<00:03:13.410> we<00:03:13.530> could<00:03:13.680> have

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:13.800 
think after killing krepo we could have

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:16.040 
think after killing krepo we could have
we<00:03:14.520> had<00:03:14.670> plenty<00:03:14.880> of<00:03:14.970> time<00:03:15.030> to<00:03:15.180> like<00:03:15.510> recall<00:03:15.840> and

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:16.050 
we had plenty of time to like recall and

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:17.450 
we had plenty of time to like recall and
just<00:03:16.230> set<00:03:16.560> up<00:03:16.680> all<00:03:16.800> the<00:03:16.890> vision<00:03:17.100> together<00:03:17.340> we

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:17.460 
just set up all the vision together we

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:18.820 
just set up all the vision together we
could<00:03:17.550> do<00:03:17.640> the<00:03:17.730> exact<00:03:17.970> same<00:03:18.000> thing<00:03:18.330> again<00:03:18.570> but

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:18.830 
could do the exact same thing again but

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:21.380 
could do the exact same thing again but
possibly<00:03:19.830> get<00:03:20.010> a<00:03:20.040> pic<00:03:20.250> on<00:03:20.370> either<00:03:20.820> in<00:03:21.030> Oxford

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:21.390 
possibly get a pic on either in Oxford

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:23.000 
possibly get a pic on either in Oxford

and<00:03:35.640> it<00:03:35.700> probably<00:03:35.880> wasn't<00:03:36.090> the<00:03:36.209> best<00:03:36.270> decision

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:36.720

kind<00:04:31.770> of<00:04:31.800> gangs<00:04:31.980> in<00:04:32.130> so<00:04:32.580> we<00:04:32.700> had<00:04:32.790> like<00:04:32.820> the<00:04:33.090> 2v

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:33.300 
kind of gangs in so we had like the 2v

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:34.790 
kind of gangs in so we had like the 2v
two<00:04:33.330> potential<00:04:33.840> top<00:04:34.050> but<00:04:34.260> we<00:04:34.380> never<00:04:34.500> really

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:34.800 
two potential top but we never really

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:36.500 
two potential top but we never really
focus<00:04:35.070> anyone<00:04:35.340> down<00:04:35.490> so<00:04:36.090> there<00:04:36.270> was<00:04:36.360> no

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:36.510 
focus anyone down so there was no

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:38.420 
focus anyone down so there was no
scaling<00:04:36.810> for<00:04:37.020> an<00:04:37.080> egg<00:04:37.200> 10<00:04:37.380> which<00:04:38.220> we<00:04:38.370> should

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:38.430 
scaling for an egg 10 which we should

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:39.950 
scaling for an egg 10 which we should
have<00:04:38.610> had<00:04:38.760> during<00:04:38.940> mid<00:04:39.150> game<00:04:39.330> where<00:04:39.690> you<00:04:39.810> could

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:39.960 
have had during mid game where you could

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:42.470 
have had during mid game where you could
have<00:04:40.080> like<00:04:40.260> trash<00:04:41.130> Kazakhs<00:04:41.610> basically<00:04:41.970> but

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:42.480 
have like trash Kazakhs basically but

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:45.020 
have like trash Kazakhs basically but
that<00:04:42.600> never<00:04:42.720> happened<00:04:42.890> so<00:04:43.890> we<00:04:44.430> just<00:04:44.640> wasted

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:45.030 
that never happened so we just wasted

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:46.970 
that never happened so we just wasted
our<00:04:45.120> potential<00:04:45.570> early<00:04:45.750> game<00:04:45.930> and<00:04:46.110> Kasich<00:04:46.860> was

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:46.980 
our potential early game and Kasich was

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:49.700 
our potential early game and Kasich was
able<00:04:47.220> to<00:04:47.310> do<00:04:47.460> something<00:04:47.820> with<00:04:47.910> game<00:04:48.440> ok<00:04:49.440> so

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:49.710 
able to do something with game ok so

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:50.630

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:33.030 
three and one you're only lost to cloud

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:35.390 
three and one you're only lost to cloud
nine<00:05:33.060> the<00:05:33.900> cloud<00:05:34.680> nine<00:05:34.830> that<00:05:34.950> looks<00:05:35.160> to<00:05:35.280> be

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:35.400

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:37.250 
nine the cloud nine that looks to be
actually<00:05:35.520> struggling<00:05:35.970> right<00:05:36.300> now<00:05:36.330> after

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:37.260 
actually struggling right now after

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:39.740 
actually struggling right now after
seeing<00:05:37.410> especially<00:05:37.650> the<00:05:38.040> last<00:05:38.280> game<00:05:38.700> with<00:05:39.570> the

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:39.750 
seeing especially the last game with the

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:41.420 
seeing especially the last game with the
mix<00:05:40.169> ups<00:05:40.380> with<00:05:40.530> shotcalling<00:05:40.890> what<00:05:41.250> are<00:05:41.340> your

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:41.430 
mix ups with shotcalling what are your

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:43.790 
mix ups with shotcalling what are your
takes<00:05:41.700> on<00:05:41.910> cloud<00:05:42.630> nine<00:05:42.840> coming<00:05:43.230> back<00:05:43.440> from<00:05:43.650> All

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:43.800 
takes on cloud nine coming back from All

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:46.400 
takes on cloud nine coming back from All
Stars<00:05:44.100> I<00:05:45.060> just<00:05:45.480> think<00:05:45.570> they<00:05:45.720> took<00:05:45.900> a<00:05:46.140> break

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:46.410 
Stars I just think they took a break

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:48.320 
Stars I just think they took a break
after<00:05:46.650> all<00:05:46.980> stars<00:05:47.250> and<00:05:47.520> so<00:05:47.790> they<00:05:47.910> only<00:05:48.060> had<00:05:48.300> I

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:48.330 
after all stars and so they only had I

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:50.360 
after all stars and so they only had I
think<00:05:48.540> their<00:05:48.780> practice<00:05:49.080> is<00:05:49.200> not<00:05:49.350> that<00:05:49.680> much<00:05:49.860> at

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:50.370 
think their practice is not that much at

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:52.220 
think their practice is not that much at
least<00:05:50.430> not<00:05:50.669> as<00:05:50.910> much<00:05:50.940> as<00:05:51.090> other<00:05:51.360> teams<00:05:51.630> and<00:05:51.870> I

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:52.230 
least not as much as other teams and I

00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:54.020 
least not as much as other teams and I
feel<00:05:52.380> like<00:05:52.530> they<00:05:52.830> should<00:05:53.130> have<00:05:53.640> maybe<00:05:53.790> used

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:54.030 
feel like they should have maybe used

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:55.670 
feel like they should have maybe used
more<00:05:54.210> time<00:05:54.390> going<00:05:54.690> are<00:05:54.930> practicing<00:05:55.410> for<00:05:55.590> the

00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:55.680 
more time going are practicing for the

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:56.659 
more time going are practicing for the
super<00:05:55.919> weak<00:05:56.040> and<00:05:56.160> that's<00:05:56.280> why<00:05:56.370> they're<00:05:56.550> not

00:05:56.659 --> 00:05:56.669 
super weak and that's why they're not

00:05:56.669 --> 00:05:58.940 
super weak and that's why they're not
looking<00:05:56.910> as<00:05:57.060> strong<00:05:57.300> but<00:05:57.620> c9<00:05:58.620> is<00:05:58.740> always<00:05:58.919> a

00:05:58.940 --> 00:05:58.950 
looking as strong but c9 is always a

00:05:58.950 --> 00:06:00.860 
looking as strong but c9 is always a
team<00:05:59.160> that<00:05:59.340> if<00:05:59.460> they<00:05:59.669> lose<00:05:59.820> one<00:06:00.060> game<00:06:00.090> they

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:00.870 
team that if they lose one game they

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:02.150 
team that if they lose one game they
just<00:06:01.050> step<00:06:01.230> it<00:06:01.350> up<00:06:01.380> they<00:06:01.500> focus<00:06:01.830> only<00:06:02.010> on

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:02.160 
just step it up they focus only on

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:03.830 
just step it up they focus only on
League<00:06:02.430> they<00:06:02.700> just<00:06:02.910> become<00:06:03.300> back<00:06:03.480> to<00:06:03.630> being

00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:39.600 
opinión fourth or fifth as the season

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:41.150 
opinión fourth or fifth as the season

we'll<00:06:41.250> get<00:06:41.460> together<00:06:41.910> even<00:06:42.300> better<00:06:42.450> and

00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:42.720 
we'll get together even better and

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:45.590 
we'll get together even better and
really<00:06:43.140> try<00:06:43.380> to<00:06:43.410> focus<00:06:43.530> on<00:06:44.220> getting<00:06:44.910> better<00:06:45.060> as

00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:45.600 
really try to focus on getting better as

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:47.960 
really try to focus on getting better as
individuals<00:06:46.110> and<00:06:46.230> then<00:06:46.380> focuses<00:06:46.920> focus<00:06:47.820> to

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:47.970 
individuals and then focuses focus to

00:06:47.970 --> 00:06:49.580 
individuals and then focuses focus to
get<00:06:48.150> better<00:06:48.300> as<00:06:48.420> a<00:06:48.510> team<00:06:48.540> and<00:06:49.050> if<00:06:49.260> that<00:06:49.290> happens

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:49.590 
get better as a team and if that happens

00:06:49.590 --> 00:06:52.010 
get better as a team and if that happens
I<00:06:50.040> think<00:06:50.340> we<00:06:50.490> could<00:06:50.670> we<00:06:50.940> should<00:06:51.000> finish<00:06:51.450> top

00:06:52.010 --> 00:06:52.020 
I think we could we should finish top

00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:54.350 
I think we could we should finish top
two<00:06:52.230> and<00:06:52.470> really<00:06:53.250> get<00:06:53.370> our<00:06:53.490> words<00:06:53.730> words

00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:54.360 
two and really get our words words

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:56.870 
two and really get our words words
placement<00:06:54.840> your<00:06:55.530> exit<00:06:55.710> habit<00:06:55.920> you<00:06:56.010> I<00:06:56.430> will

00:06:56.870 --> 00:06:56.880 
placement your exit habit you I will

00:06:56.880 --> 00:06:58.850 
placement your exit habit you I will
also<00:06:57.030> say<00:06:57.150> third<00:06:57.630> or<00:06:57.780> fourth<00:06:57.960> place<00:06:58.170> we<00:06:58.710> have

00:06:58.850 --> 00:06:58.860 
also say third or fourth place we have

00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:00.230 
also say third or fourth place we have
Dignitas<00:06:59.340> coming<00:06:59.640> up<00:06:59.700> looking<00:06:59.910> really<00:06:59.970> strong

00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:00.240 
Dignitas coming up looking really strong

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:02.090 
Dignitas coming up looking really strong
lmq<00:07:00.840> also<00:07:01.080> looking<00:07:01.320> really<00:07:01.500> strong<00:07:01.560> going<00:07:01.890> 40

00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:02.100 
lmq also looking really strong going 40

00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:04.010 
lmq also looking really strong going 40
so<00:07:02.730> I<00:07:02.760> think<00:07:02.850> if<00:07:03.120> we<00:07:03.210> were<00:07:03.330> going<00:07:03.720> to<00:07:03.780> be<00:07:03.870> at<00:07:03.960> the

00:07:04.010 --> 00:07:04.020 
so I think if we were going to be at the

00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:04.850 
so I think if we were going to be at the
strength<00:07:04.230> of<00:07:04.290> the<00:07:04.350> hour<00:07:04.410> now<00:07:04.590> we<00:07:04.650> would

00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:04.860 
strength of the hour now we would

00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:07.370 
strength of the hour now we would
probably<00:07:05.040> be<00:07:05.250> fourth<00:07:05.850> place<00:07:06.060> I<00:07:06.210> would<00:07:06.330> say<00:07:06.510> but

00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:07.380 
probably be fourth place I would say but

00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:08.900 
probably be fourth place I would say but
we're<00:07:07.800> really<00:07:07.950> aiming<00:07:08.100> to<00:07:08.310> get<00:07:08.400> that<00:07:08.550> top<00:07:08.730> two

00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:08.910 
we're really aiming to get that top two

00:07:08.910 --> 00:07:10.640 
we're really aiming to get that top two
and<00:07:09.210> with<00:07:09.480> the<00:07:09.570> new<00:07:09.600> team<00:07:09.900> we<00:07:10.170> have<00:07:10.200> a<00:07:10.320> lot<00:07:10.470> more

00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:10.650 
and with the new team we have a lot more

00:07:10.650 --> 00:07:13.400 
and with the new team we have a lot more
planning<00:07:11.400> going<00:07:11.520> into<00:07:11.760> games<00:07:11.940> and<00:07:12.300> I<00:07:12.780> think<00:07:13.320> we

00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:13.410 
planning going into games and I think we

00:07:13.410 --> 00:07:14.720 
planning going into games and I think we
just<00:07:13.500> look<00:07:13.710> we're<00:07:14.190> gonna<00:07:14.280> look<00:07:14.490> stronger

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:14.730 
just look we're gonna look stronger

00:07:14.730 --> 00:07:16.280 
just look we're gonna look stronger
overall<00:07:15.060> as<00:07:15.240> we<00:07:15.420> progress<00:07:15.690> with<00:07:15.930> the<00:07:16.020> season
