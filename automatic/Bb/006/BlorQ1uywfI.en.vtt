00:00:24.089 --> 00:00:27.089
 human consumption 

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:32.530
 as our motto says 

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:35.530
 we get behind the wheel for men a tip 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:50.210
 the minister what we would like to do to all pass by the gas stations 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:52.480
 View as little as possible 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:55.860
 cheapen a few euros since we are in crisis 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.200
 poles see it some guidelines that some secrets to get a driving 

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:02.220
 more economical 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:04.210
 start the march 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:07.210
 gently and progressively 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:09.890
 immediately 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:13.580
 and going up on marches to the longest march in order to 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:18.170
 that the consumption is very tight in the case of the diesel engine does not exceed 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:21.810
 atomic revolutions and in the case of the atomic gasoline engine five hundred 

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:23.910
 hirsch always 

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:27.210
 rising of marches of progressive form 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.210
 Above all, maintain a uniform rhythm 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.210
 Do not give violent accelerations or sudden braking 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.770
 this will allow higher consumption to be better 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:39.770
 never forget about car shoes 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.360
 bring correct pressures

 with the final purpose 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.460
 translated into more pleasant and the consumptions are lower 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:50.230
 serene 

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:53.230
 progressively 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:58.030
 the more we accelerate the more we consume the shorter the march 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:01.890
 we consume in short if we intend to achieve consumption 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:08.140
 approved not low consumption the best will be to accelerate the less better to go to 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:10.049
 the longest possible march 

00:02:10.049 --> 00:02:13.689
 do not forget our next appointment the cross we will make a new advice in 

00:02:13.689 --> 00:02:15.629
 exclusive for the tobacconist 

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:18.169
 so that you are better drivers 

00:02:18.169 --> 00:02:19.329
 coastal 

00:02:19.329 --> 00:02:20.409
 see you soon 

00:02:20.409 --> 00:02:21.719
 remember
