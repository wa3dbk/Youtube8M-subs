00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
see here shortly so how this works is by

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.670 
see here shortly so how this works is by
using<00:01:33.210> the<00:01:33.479> pearlescent<00:01:33.869> Rick<00:01:34.290> and<00:01:34.439> of<00:01:34.500> course

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
using the pearlescent Rick and of course

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:35.840 
using the pearlescent Rick and of course
to<00:01:34.799> do<00:01:34.890> that<00:01:35.040> all<00:01:35.159> you<00:01:35.220> want<00:01:35.369> to<00:01:35.430> do<00:01:35.520> is<00:01:35.700> go<00:01:35.820> back

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
to do that all you want to do is go back

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.520 
to do that all you want to do is go back
into<00:01:36.180> your<00:01:36.360> primary<00:01:36.630> section<00:01:36.900> again<00:01:37.140> go<00:01:37.380> down

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
into your primary section again go down

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:38.960 
into your primary section again go down

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.670 
to the metallic section watch your no
metallic<00:01:39.180> section<00:01:39.630> simply<00:01:39.990> back<00:01:40.200> out<00:01:40.439> back

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
metallic section simply back out back

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.859 
metallic section simply back out back
out<00:01:40.860> again<00:01:41.009> then<00:01:41.790> patches<00:01:42.060> anything<00:01:42.600> on<00:01:42.750> the

with the gameplay at this point in the
combination<00:02:01.469> it<00:02:02.009> kind<00:02:02.250> of<00:02:02.310> stands<00:02:02.549> out<00:02:02.640> a

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
combination it kind of stands out a

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.069 
combination it kind of stands out a
little<00:02:02.850> bit<00:02:03.000> more<00:02:03.149> in<00:02:03.240> the<00:02:03.299> secondary<00:02:03.810> and

with<00:02:06.149> the<00:02:06.240> chrome<00:02:06.479> but<00:02:06.689> it<00:02:06.780> will<00:02:06.869> all<00:02:07.049> come

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
with the chrome but it will all come

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:08.930 
with the chrome but it will all come
together<00:02:07.409> nicely<00:02:07.740> at<00:02:08.099> the<00:02:08.220> very<00:02:08.459> end<00:02:08.640> when<00:02:08.879> you

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940
