these two additional connectors should

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.870 
these two additional connectors should
you<00:00:12.030> need<00:00:12.179> it<00:00:12.440> but<00:00:13.440> in<00:00:13.679> most<00:00:13.950> cases<00:00:14.070> you<00:00:14.759> will

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
you need it but in most cases you will

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:16.790

not<00:00:15.030> have<00:00:15.269> anything<00:00:15.540> connected<00:00:16.109> to<00:00:16.139> them<00:00:16.350> so

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
not have anything connected to them so

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.529 
not have anything connected to them so
you<00:00:16.830> can<00:00:17.010> rest<00:00:17.190> assured<00:00:17.550> there's<00:00:18.060> more<00:00:18.359> than

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:02.250 

now<00:01:59.950> to<00:02:00.430> get<00:02:00.580> the<00:02:00.670> old<00:02:00.820> psu<00:02:01.210> out<00:02:01.390> I<00:02:01.600> just<00:02:01.990> slide

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:02.260 
now to get the old psu out I just slide

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:05.840 
now to get the old psu out I just slide
it<00:02:02.409> forward<00:02:02.560> a<00:02:02.740> little<00:02:02.770> bit<00:02:03.159> and<00:02:03.340> it<00:02:03.820> pops<00:02:04.060> free

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
it forward a little bit and it pops free

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.520 
it forward a little bit and it pops free
putting<00:02:06.850> the<00:02:06.940> 280<00:02:07.630> watt<00:02:07.810> version<00:02:07.840> in<00:02:08.259> is<00:02:08.470> just

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:08.530 
putting the 280 watt version in is just

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:10.850 
putting the 280 watt version in is just
as<00:02:09.069> simple<00:02:09.220> with<00:02:09.940> a<00:02:09.970> couple<00:02:10.300> of<00:02:10.360> differences

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
as simple with a couple of differences

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.350 
as simple with a couple of differences
because<00:02:11.860> the<00:02:12.040> slots<00:02:12.340> on<00:02:12.520> the<00:02:12.550> underside<00:02:13.090> are

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
because the slots on the underside are

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.420 
because the slots on the underside are

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430 
different the piece you will not be

different the piece you will not be
sliding<00:02:15.850> on<00:02:16.000> to<00:02:16.180> them<00:02:16.330> instead<00:02:16.989> it<00:02:17.920> will<00:02:18.040> just

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.220 
sliding on to them instead it will just

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:20.460 
sliding on to them instead it will just
ride<00:02:18.520> on<00:02:18.730> top<00:02:18.940> of<00:02:19.120> them<00:02:19.300> this<00:02:20.020> will<00:02:20.200> make<00:02:20.350> the

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:20.470 
ride on top of them this will make the

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:22.770 
ride on top of them this will make the
PSU<00:02:20.830> sit<00:02:21.069> a<00:02:21.100> little<00:02:21.280> bit<00:02:21.400> higher<00:02:21.520> maybe<00:02:22.480> an

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:22.780 
PSU sit a little bit higher maybe an

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:24.240 
PSU sit a little bit higher maybe an
eighth<00:02:22.989> of<00:02:23.140> an<00:02:23.260> inch<00:02:23.350> higher<00:02:23.739> than<00:02:23.770> the<00:02:24.100> other

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250 
eighth of an inch higher than the other

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:27.210 
eighth of an inch higher than the other
version<00:02:24.900> don't<00:02:25.900> worry<00:02:26.080> about<00:02:26.170> that<00:02:26.470> because

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:27.220 
version don't worry about that because

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:29.430 
version don't worry about that because
once<00:02:27.430> the<00:02:27.580> case<00:02:27.730> is<00:02:27.760> closed<00:02:28.209> it<00:02:28.600> will<00:02:28.870> hold<00:02:29.260> it

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:29.440 
once the case is closed it will hold it

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:32.790 
once the case is closed it will hold it
even<00:02:29.590> more<00:02:29.920> tightly<00:02:30.190> in<00:02:30.370> place<00:02:31.290> next<00:02:32.290> we<00:02:32.739> are

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:32.800 
even more tightly in place next we are

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:35.009 
even more tightly in place next we are
going<00:02:33.010> to<00:02:33.130> utilize<00:02:33.640> this<00:02:34.150> little<00:02:34.450> chassis<00:02:34.810> tab

00:02:35.009 --> 00:02:35.019 
going to utilize this little chassis tab

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:37.890 
going to utilize this little chassis tab
this<00:02:35.860> tab<00:02:36.160> keeps<00:02:36.430> the<00:02:36.580> PSU<00:02:37.000> from<00:02:37.420> sliding<00:02:37.810> in

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:37.900 
this tab keeps the PSU from sliding in

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:41.890 
this tab keeps the PSU from sliding in
this<00:02:37.989> direction

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:41.900 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:52.120 

now<00:02:42.900> we<00:02:43.410> can<00:02:43.590> reconnect<00:02:44.010> all<00:02:44.250> the<00:02:44.459> connectors

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:52.130 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:03:20.430 

you

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:20.440 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:23.530 

because<00:03:21.440> there<00:03:21.590> are<00:03:21.680> no<00:03:21.800> screws<00:03:22.160> the<00:03:22.970> PSU<00:03:23.390> will

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:23.540 
because there are no screws the PSU will

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:25.390 
because there are no screws the PSU will
appear<00:03:23.870> to<00:03:24.020> just<00:03:24.230> float<00:03:24.500> here<00:03:24.770> in<00:03:24.860> place<00:03:25.130> at

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:25.400 
appear to just float here in place at

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:28.090 
appear to just float here in place at
the<00:03:25.820> top<00:03:26.030> of<00:03:26.150> the<00:03:26.240> chassis<00:03:26.420> but<00:03:27.320> if<00:03:27.770> you<00:03:27.950> think

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:28.100 
the top of the chassis but if you think

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:29.980 
the top of the chassis but if you think
about<00:03:28.400> it<00:03:28.550> once<00:03:28.940> the<00:03:29.120> cover<00:03:29.300> is<00:03:29.450> placed<00:03:29.780> back

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:29.990 
about it once the cover is placed back

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:32.380 
about it once the cover is placed back
it<00:03:30.530> is<00:03:30.680> really<00:03:31.010> secure<00:03:31.190> because<00:03:31.790> it<00:03:32.090> is<00:03:32.210> held

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:32.390 
it is really secure because it is held

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:35.170 
it is really secure because it is held
in<00:03:32.480> place<00:03:32.600> on<00:03:32.930> all<00:03:33.290> six<00:03:33.680> sides<00:03:33.890> it<00:03:34.700> can't<00:03:35.060> move

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:35.180 
in place on all six sides it can't move

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:38.080 
in place on all six sides it can't move
this<00:03:35.390> way<00:03:35.600> nor<00:03:36.440> this<00:03:36.620> way<00:03:36.860> nor<00:03:37.520> this<00:03:37.730> way

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:38.090 
this way nor this way nor this way

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:40.270 
this way nor this way nor this way
let's<00:03:39.080> close<00:03:39.260> the<00:03:39.440> cover<00:03:39.650> and<00:03:39.860> I'll<00:03:40.100> show<00:03:40.250> you

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:40.280 
let's close the cover and I'll show you

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:43.020 
let's close the cover and I'll show you
what<00:03:40.490> I<00:03:40.520> mean<00:03:40.780> see<00:03:41.780> check<00:03:42.260> it<00:03:42.380> out

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:43.030 
what I mean see check it out

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:45.790 
what I mean see check it out
now<00:03:44.030> this<00:03:44.270> pc<00:03:44.630> is<00:03:44.870> ready<00:03:45.200> for<00:03:45.380> regular<00:03:45.590> use

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:45.800 
now this pc is ready for regular use

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:50.410 
now this pc is ready for regular use
again<00:03:47.620> now<00:03:48.620> a<00:03:48.830> thing<00:03:49.040> to<00:03:49.160> note<00:03:49.370> because<00:03:50.060> the

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:50.420 
again now a thing to note because the

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:52.030 
again now a thing to note because the
side<00:03:50.630> cover<00:03:50.930> is<00:03:51.110> used<00:03:51.350> as<00:03:51.590> one<00:03:51.830> of<00:03:51.860> the

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:52.040 
side cover is used as one of the
