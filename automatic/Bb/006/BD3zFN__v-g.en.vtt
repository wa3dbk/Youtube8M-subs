00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:21.049 
approaches the reason the garmin was so

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:23.760 
approaches the reason the garmin was so
is<00:01:21.260> so<00:01:21.470> excited<00:01:22.009> about<00:01:22.100> the<00:01:22.729> vertical<00:01:23.360> power

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:23.770 
is so excited about the vertical power

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:26.620 
is so excited about the vertical power
interfaces<00:01:24.770> that<00:01:24.799> we<00:01:25.549> really<00:01:25.939> it's<00:01:26.119> a<00:01:26.210> request

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:26.630 
interfaces that we really it's a request

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:29.440 
interfaces that we really it's a request
that<00:01:26.869> came<00:01:27.079> from<00:01:27.409> people<00:01:28.130> who<00:01:28.340> were<00:01:28.460> wanting

00:01:31.749 --> 00:01:31.759 
to buy the g 3x and it already purchased

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:34.620 
to buy the g 3x and it already purchased
the<00:01:31.880> vertical<00:01:32.299> power<00:01:32.479> system<00:01:33.049> so<00:01:33.590> in<00:01:33.920> order<00:01:34.130> to

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:34.630 
the vertical power system so in order to

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:37.420 
the vertical power system so in order to
accommodate<00:01:35.630> them<00:01:36.109> and<00:01:36.380> as<00:01:36.740> we<00:01:36.950> can<00:01:37.130> in<00:01:37.369> the

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:37.430 
accommodate them and as we can in the

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:40.450 
accommodate them and as we can in the
experimental<00:01:37.909> market<00:01:38.420> we<00:01:38.930> got<00:01:39.890> with<00:01:40.100> vertical

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:40.460 
experimental market we got with vertical

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:42.520 
experimental market we got with vertical
power<00:01:40.759> and<00:01:41.119> develop<00:01:41.659> an<00:01:41.810> interface<00:01:42.200> that's

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:42.530 
power and develop an interface that's

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:43.990 
power and develop an interface that's
quite<00:01:42.770> intuitive<00:01:43.100> and<00:01:43.549> very

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:44.000
