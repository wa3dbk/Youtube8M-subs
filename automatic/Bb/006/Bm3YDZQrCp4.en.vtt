and<00:01:28.070> these<00:01:29.070> things<00:01:29.310> are<00:01:29.549> not<00:01:29.700> cheap<00:01:30.000> so<00:01:30.060> this

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
and these things are not cheap so this

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.690 
and these things are not cheap so this
is<00:01:30.780> about<00:01:31.020> 1700<00:01:31.560> rupees<00:01:32.040> which<00:01:32.220> is<00:01:32.400> freaking

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
is about 1700 rupees which is freaking

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.910 
is about 1700 rupees which is freaking
expensive<00:01:32.880> for<00:01:33.299> just<00:01:33.509> a<00:01:33.630> swappable<00:01:34.259> cover<00:01:34.619> but

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
expensive for just a swappable cover but

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.620 
expensive for just a swappable cover but
then<00:01:35.159> again<00:01:36.680> you<00:01:37.680> have<00:01:37.710> to<00:01:38.540> understand<00:01:39.540> the

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
then again you have to understand the

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.090 
then again you have to understand the
fact<00:01:39.659> that<00:01:39.930> the<00:01:40.049> company<00:01:40.229> sells<00:01:40.500> the<00:01:40.920> phone

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
fact that the company sells the phone

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.590 
fact that the company sells the phone
are<00:01:41.220> really<00:01:41.520> attractive<00:01:41.909> price<00:01:42.090> point<00:01:42.390> so<00:01:42.570> I

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
are really attractive price point so I

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.210 
are really attractive price point so I
think<00:01:42.720> probably<00:01:42.960> they're<00:01:43.200> making<00:01:43.470> a<00:01:43.649> lot<00:01:44.189> more

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
think probably they're making a lot more

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.490 
think probably they're making a lot more
modules<00:01:44.970> from<00:01:45.149> the<00:01:45.240> AK<00:01:45.630> series<00:01:45.810> itself<00:01:46.140> so

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
modules from the AK series itself so

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:47.510 
modules from the AK series itself so
that's<00:01:46.710> way<00:01:46.920> I<00:01:46.950> think<00:01:47.100> the<00:01:47.340> price<00:01:47.490> is

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
that's way I think the price is

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.120 
that's way I think the price is
justified<00:01:48.119> and<00:01:48.390> the<00:01:49.290> beauty<00:01:49.710> is<00:01:49.799> that<00:01:49.829> you<00:01:49.979> can

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
justified and the beauty is that you can

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.560 
justified and the beauty is that you can
actually<00:01:50.250> in<00:01:50.460> case<00:01:50.610> you<00:01:50.700> get<00:01:50.790> bored<00:01:51.000> of<00:01:51.390> this

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
actually in case you get bored of this

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.870 
actually in case you get bored of this
regular<00:01:52.110> back<00:01:52.320> cover<00:01:52.590> of<00:01:52.649> the<00:01:52.770> phone<00:01:52.860> you<00:01:53.759> can

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
regular back cover of the phone you can

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.550 
regular back cover of the phone you can
just<00:01:54.030> wrap<00:01:54.149> the<00:01:54.299> covers<00:01:54.570> and<00:01:54.810> change<00:01:55.049> the<00:01:55.259> way

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
just wrap the covers and change the way

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.319 
just wrap the covers and change the way
you<00:01:55.619> feel<00:01:55.770> the<00:01:56.219> phone<00:01:56.399> I<00:01:56.579> am<00:01:56.610> actually<00:01:56.820> exactly

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
you feel the phone I am actually exactly

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:59.719 
you feel the phone I am actually exactly
about<00:01:57.509> the<00:01:57.780> rows<00:01:58.409> for<00:01:58.649> Amanda<00:01:59.009> Kevlar<00:01:59.369> as<00:01:59.549> well

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
about the rows for Amanda Kevlar as well

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:02.450 
about the rows for Amanda Kevlar as well
not<00:02:00.270> really<00:02:00.570> a<00:02:00.630> fan<00:02:00.810> of<00:02:00.840> the<00:02:01.049> bamboo<00:02:01.380> so<00:02:02.040> but

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
not really a fan of the bamboo so but

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.370 
not really a fan of the bamboo so but
let's<00:02:02.670> actually<00:02:02.880> go<00:02:03.210> ahead<00:02:03.270> and<00:02:03.479> take<00:02:04.229> this

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
let's actually go ahead and take this

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.399 
let's actually go ahead and take this
guy<00:02:04.439> out<00:02:04.710> of<00:02:04.799> the<00:02:05.119> packaging<00:02:06.119> so<00:02:06.750> here<00:02:07.170> we<00:02:07.290> have

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
guy out of the packaging so here we have

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:09.839 
guy out of the packaging so here we have
the<00:02:07.560> back<00:02:07.740> cover<00:02:07.979> itself

00:02:09.839 --> 00:02:09.849 
the back cover itself

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:14.099 
the back cover itself
so<00:02:10.509> it<00:02:10.869> looks<00:02:11.019> like<00:02:11.170> a<00:02:11.200> NFC<00:02:11.890> tag<00:02:12.450> so<00:02:13.450> really

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:14.109 
so it looks like a NFC tag so really

00:02:14.109 --> 00:02:16.709 
so it looks like a NFC tag so really
nice<00:02:14.230> feel<00:02:15.010> but<00:02:15.849> expect<00:02:16.150> it<00:02:16.239> to<00:02:16.329> be<00:02:16.450> a<00:02:16.480> little

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:16.719 
nice feel but expect it to be a little

00:02:16.719 --> 00:02:19.559 
nice feel but expect it to be a little
bit<00:02:16.840> more<00:02:17.109> rough<00:02:17.379> but<00:02:18.069> it's<00:02:18.189> a<00:02:18.250> bit<00:02:18.430> soft<00:02:18.730> so

00:02:19.559 --> 00:02:19.569 
bit more rough but it's a bit soft so

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:24.959 
bit more rough but it's a bit soft so
let's<00:02:19.719> actually<00:02:20.310> swap<00:02:21.310> this<00:02:21.519> guy<00:02:22.140> out<00:02:23.969> only

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:24.969 
let's actually swap this guy out only

00:02:24.969 --> 00:02:26.670 
let's actually swap this guy out only
fear<00:02:25.329> for<00:02:25.569> me<00:02:25.689> I'm<00:02:25.900> gonna<00:02:26.049> be<00:02:26.140> breaking<00:02:26.319> one<00:02:26.650> of

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680 
fear for me I'm gonna be breaking one of

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:28.170 
fear for me I'm gonna be breaking one of
these<00:02:26.890> covers<00:02:27.189> when<00:02:27.430> I<00:02:27.489> actually<00:02:27.670> remove<00:02:28.090> it

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180 
these covers when I actually remove it

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:31.470 
these covers when I actually remove it
it's<00:02:28.989> really<00:02:29.260> hard<00:02:29.650> to<00:02:30.519> not<00:02:30.700> worry<00:02:31.060> about<00:02:31.150> it

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.480 
it's really hard to not worry about it

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:34.380 
it's really hard to not worry about it
well<00:02:32.349> it<00:02:32.560> is<00:02:32.799> solid<00:02:33.220> compared<00:02:33.700> to<00:02:33.909> the<00:02:34.269> regular

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.390 
well it is solid compared to the regular

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:36.300 
well it is solid compared to the regular
one<00:02:34.750> it's<00:02:34.930> so<00:02:35.079> thin<00:02:35.379> the<00:02:35.560> regular<00:02:35.829> one<00:02:36.010> but

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:36.310 
one it's so thin the regular one but

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:38.970 
one it's so thin the regular one but
this<00:02:37.000> doesn't<00:02:37.239> flex<00:02:37.599> much<00:02:37.750> so<00:02:38.260> it's<00:02:38.379> I<00:02:38.650> think

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:38.980 
this doesn't flex much so it's I think

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:40.470 
this doesn't flex much so it's I think
adds<00:02:39.189> a<00:02:39.370> bit<00:02:39.519> of<00:02:39.579> thickness<00:02:39.790> to<00:02:39.969> the<00:02:40.120> device<00:02:40.329> I

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:40.480 
adds a bit of thickness to the device I

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:43.559 
adds a bit of thickness to the device I
would<00:02:40.569> say<00:02:40.810> wow<00:02:41.590> this<00:02:42.519> thing<00:02:42.819> makes<00:02:43.120> the<00:02:43.329> phone

00:02:43.559 --> 00:02:43.569 
would say wow this thing makes the phone

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:46.649 
would say wow this thing makes the phone
look<00:02:43.989> really<00:02:44.319> nice<00:02:45.180> let's<00:02:46.180> actually<00:02:46.359> click

00:02:46.649 --> 00:02:46.659 
look really nice let's actually click

00:02:46.659 --> 00:02:50.670 
look really nice let's actually click
compare<00:02:47.879> in<00:02:48.879> terms<00:02:48.909> of<00:02:49.299> thickness<00:02:49.480> no<00:02:50.349> I<00:02:50.379> don't

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:50.680 
compare in terms of thickness no I don't

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:52.770 
compare in terms of thickness no I don't
know<00:02:50.739> if<00:02:50.859> it's<00:02:50.950> fully<00:02:51.129> seated<00:02:51.400> or<00:02:51.669> not<00:02:51.819> for<00:02:52.599> is

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:52.780 
know if it's fully seated or not for is

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:55.140 
know if it's fully seated or not for is
it<00:02:52.959> the<00:02:53.340> cover<00:02:54.340> itself<00:02:54.669> I<00:02:54.879> think<00:02:54.939> it's

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.150 
it the cover itself I think it's

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:56.129 
it the cover itself I think it's
actually<00:02:55.269> adding<00:02:55.720> a<00:02:55.780> little<00:02:55.959> bit<00:02:56.079> of

00:02:56.129 --> 00:02:56.139 
actually adding a little bit of

00:02:56.139 --> 00:02:57.449 
actually adding a little bit of
thickness<00:02:56.319> to<00:02:56.620> the<00:02:56.709> device<00:02:56.919> as<00:02:57.099> you<00:02:57.159> can<00:02:57.310> see

00:02:57.449 --> 00:02:57.459 
thickness to the device as you can see

00:02:57.459 --> 00:02:59.789 
thickness to the device as you can see
in<00:02:57.579> the<00:02:57.700> back<00:02:57.970> the<00:02:58.810> sides<00:02:59.049> so<00:02:59.500> let's<00:02:59.530> actually

00:02:59.789 --> 00:02:59.799 
in the back the sides so let's actually

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:03.869 
in the back the sides so let's actually
take<00:03:00.010> another<00:03:00.280> 1+2<00:03:00.579> behavior<00:03:01.120> I<00:03:02.549> actually<00:03:03.549> see

00:03:03.869 --> 00:03:03.879 
take another 1+2 behavior I actually see

00:03:03.879 --> 00:03:05.729 
take another 1+2 behavior I actually see
it's<00:03:04.060> adding<00:03:04.419> some<00:03:04.599> amount<00:03:04.900> of<00:03:05.079> thickness<00:03:05.319> to

00:03:05.729 --> 00:03:05.739 
it's adding some amount of thickness to

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:10.409 
it's adding some amount of thickness to
the<00:03:05.859> device<00:03:06.209> but<00:03:07.209> then<00:03:07.419> feels<00:03:09.269> really<00:03:10.269> nice<00:03:10.359> in

00:03:10.409 --> 00:03:10.419 
the device but then feels really nice in

00:03:10.419 --> 00:03:13.800 
the device but then feels really nice in
the<00:03:10.599> hand<00:03:10.629> so<00:03:11.069> I<00:03:12.069> think<00:03:12.280> I<00:03:12.730> mean<00:03:13.480> without

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:13.810 
the hand so I think I mean without

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:16.050 
the hand so I think I mean without
trying<00:03:14.079> the<00:03:14.260> other<00:03:14.739> cases<00:03:15.040> I<00:03:15.430> mean<00:03:15.669> the<00:03:15.849> side

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:16.060 
trying the other cases I mean the side

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:17.969 
trying the other cases I mean the side
stripes<00:03:16.389> for<00:03:16.569> our<00:03:16.629> covers<00:03:16.930> I<00:03:17.169> would<00:03:17.709> probably

00:03:17.969 --> 00:03:17.979 
stripes for our covers I would probably

00:03:17.979 --> 00:03:20.729 
stripes for our covers I would probably
recommend<00:03:18.190> the<00:03:18.459> kevlar<00:03:19.209> one<00:03:19.379> and<00:03:20.379> I<00:03:20.560> think

00:03:20.729 --> 00:03:20.739 
recommend the kevlar one and I think

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:24.020 
recommend the kevlar one and I think
it's<00:03:20.829> not<00:03:21.220> a<00:03:21.250> fingerprint<00:03:21.909> magnet<00:03:22.090> too<00:03:23.010> so

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:24.030 
it's not a fingerprint magnet too so

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:29.699 
it's not a fingerprint magnet too so
feels<00:03:25.030> really<00:03:25.829> nice<00:03:26.829> to<00:03:27.159> have<00:03:27.639> use<00:03:27.909> so<00:03:28.709> let's

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:29.709 
feels really nice to have use so let's

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:32.640 
feels really nice to have use so let's
leave<00:03:29.919> this<00:03:30.069> like<00:03:30.280> this<00:03:30.489> selects<00:03:31.150> and<00:03:32.109> take<00:03:32.620> a

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:32.650 
leave this like this selects and take a

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:35.809 
leave this like this selects and take a
look<00:03:32.829> now<00:03:32.949> at<00:03:32.979> the<00:03:33.280> car<00:03:33.699> with<00:03:33.819> Rosewood<00:03:34.209> first

00:03:35.809 --> 00:03:35.819 
look now at the car with Rosewood first

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:39.539 
look now at the car with Rosewood first
so<00:03:36.819> here<00:03:37.000> we<00:03:37.120> have<00:03:37.269> the<00:03:37.540> Rosewood<00:03:38.199> cover<00:03:38.590> for

00:03:39.539 --> 00:03:39.549 
so here we have the Rosewood cover for

00:03:39.549 --> 00:03:41.610 
so here we have the Rosewood cover for
the<00:03:39.639> oneplus<00:03:40.000> 2<00:03:40.180> the<00:03:40.299> Stiles<00:03:40.540> fat<00:03:40.810> cover<00:03:41.109> this

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:41.620 
the oneplus 2 the Stiles fat cover this

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:44.039 
the oneplus 2 the Stiles fat cover this
feels<00:03:41.889> nice<00:03:42.099> too<00:03:42.310> is<00:03:42.459> this<00:03:42.669> nice<00:03:42.909> sticker<00:03:43.329> on

00:03:44.039 --> 00:03:44.049 
feels nice too is this nice sticker on

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:47.069 
feels nice too is this nice sticker on
oneplus<00:03:44.440> logo<00:03:44.829> but<00:03:45.760> this<00:03:45.970> is<00:03:46.150> also<00:03:46.449> solid<00:03:46.659> in

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:47.079 
oneplus logo but this is also solid in

00:03:47.079 --> 00:03:49.890 
oneplus logo but this is also solid in
terms<00:03:47.349> of<00:03:47.620> the<00:03:48.209> construction<00:03:49.209> doesn't<00:03:49.419> really

if you're a fan of the wood texture on
phones<00:04:11.259> like<00:04:11.620> I<00:04:11.739> think<00:04:11.799> the<00:04:12.009> Moto<00:04:12.220> X<00:04:12.459> moto

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:13.000 
phones like I think the Moto X moto

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.050 
phones like I think the Moto X moto
maker<00:04:13.180> I<00:04:13.359> think<00:04:13.750> had<00:04:13.900> a<00:04:13.930> good<00:04:14.769> addition<00:04:15.060> so

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:16.060 
maker I think had a good addition so

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:18.089 
maker I think had a good addition so
very<00:04:16.269> similar<00:04:16.599> to<00:04:16.720> that<00:04:16.870> in<00:04:17.079> terms<00:04:17.229> of<00:04:17.470> the

00:04:18.089 --> 00:04:18.099 
very similar to that in terms of the

00:04:18.099 --> 00:04:20.670 
very similar to that in terms of the
feel<00:04:18.340> and<00:04:18.639> the<00:04:18.729> looks<00:04:18.940> and<00:04:19.469> beautifully<00:04:20.469> done

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:20.680 
feel and the looks and beautifully done

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:21.400 
feel and the looks and beautifully done
so

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:21.410 
so

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:23.170 
so
really<00:04:22.070> different<00:04:22.400> personality<00:04:22.850> it<00:04:22.910> gives<00:04:23.060> to

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:23.180 
really different personality it gives to

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:27.190 
really different personality it gives to
the<00:04:23.240> phone<00:04:23.510> this<00:04:24.290> is<00:04:24.470> the<00:04:24.620> oneplus<00:04:25.190> two<00:04:26.200> rows

similar again
so<00:04:50.300> let's<00:04:50.480> actually<00:04:50.660> put<00:04:51.020> this<00:04:51.170> on<00:04:51.400> and<00:04:52.400> take<00:04:52.610> a

so let's actually put this on and take a

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:56.770 
so let's actually put this on and take a
look<00:04:54.130> so<00:04:55.130> this<00:04:55.160> is<00:04:55.430> d<00:04:55.580> 1<00:04:55.700> +<00:04:55.910> 2<00:04:56.090> with<00:04:56.240> the<00:04:56.360> Bamboo

Stylus back cover fitted so yeah I think

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:06.070

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:06.080 
even this adds that would have bulk to

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:09.490 
even this adds that would have bulk to
the<00:05:06.170> actual<00:05:06.470> device<00:05:07.210> but<00:05:08.210> then<00:05:08.510> I<00:05:08.900> still<00:05:09.290> work

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:09.500 
the actual device but then I still work

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:11.950 
the actual device but then I still work
for<00:05:09.650> the<00:05:09.710> Kevlar<00:05:10.300> in<00:05:11.300> case<00:05:11.510> you're<00:05:11.660> a<00:05:11.690> fan<00:05:11.930> of

forward<00:05:17.810> I<00:05:18.020> think<00:05:18.260> you<00:05:18.320> should<00:05:18.470> go<00:05:18.590> for<00:05:18.830> the

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:20.110 
forward I think you should go for the

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:22.480 
forward I think you should go for the
crossword<00:05:21.110> one<00:05:21.260> that<00:05:21.620> also<00:05:21.770> another<00:05:22.100> one

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:22.490 
crossword one that also another one

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:24.490 
crossword one that also another one
I<00:05:22.520> think<00:05:22.970> apricot<00:05:23.690> wood<00:05:24.050> which<00:05:24.230> is<00:05:24.350> very

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:24.500 
I think apricot wood which is very

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:26.050 
I think apricot wood which is very
similar<00:05:24.710> to<00:05:24.830> this<00:05:25.040> but<00:05:25.100> in<00:05:25.370> a<00:05:25.430> black<00:05:25.610> texture

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:26.060 
similar to this but in a black texture

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:28.090 
similar to this but in a black texture
so<00:05:26.960> that's<00:05:27.140> also<00:05:27.320> available<00:05:27.440> we<00:05:27.920> didn't

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:28.100 
so that's also available we didn't

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:30.610 
so that's also available we didn't
manage<00:05:28.190> to<00:05:28.370> get<00:05:28.610> that<00:05:28.790> but<00:05:29.380> these<00:05:30.380> are<00:05:30.440> the

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:30.620 
manage to get that but these are the

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:33.700 
manage to get that but these are the
other<00:05:30.800> three<00:05:31.040> which<00:05:31.250> are<00:05:31.370> on<00:05:31.520> sale<00:05:31.760> so<00:05:32.660> so<00:05:33.620> that
