00:00:01.119 --> 00:00:04.450
 one to all and they're not ovid is behind on the improvements that already 

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:08.069
 they add puppet problems in the final version like that is a beta 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:11.519
 will be to collect fault recover things recover 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:15.939
 in all kinds of complaints from people such as 1% to complaints have been 

00:00:15.939 --> 00:00:17.599
 heard 

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:19.150
 everything has been 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:20.470
 analyzed 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:23.650
 and in the final version the following errors have already been corrected 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:26.880
 we are and in the beta will be corrected Jewish settlers and they will be corrected 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.839
 and he will proceed to read them 

00:00:28.839 --> 00:00:31.869
 I hope this is going to take a lot of interest for the drunk people that 

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:35.320
 quite interesting because a lot of people who think of buying such little 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:36.260
 which one does not look 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.079
 it is a truth or they do not show that the final result 

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:44.199
 I had some demo, I am not so always, the final result is cheaper - eat 

00:00:44.199 --> 00:00:45.360
 in which an abyss 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.500
 the goal we have some errors that is normal 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:51.750
 but the athletes when we warned as customers of the service 

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:56.950
 the activity that is proven right the easiest work that killed us he 

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:57.960
 is dead 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.340
 that time sometimes with bushes on the ground 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:01.750
 provoked 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:04.859
 problems with ad with counting dead teammates 

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:10.110
 the error that sometimes a beggar movement shot caused more damage than 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.170
 the normal kisses that I hit grade to run and that the morning 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:17.050
 and made a decision is to come back here 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:20.660
 the first video of which says that there were honest people very very fast 

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:22.580
 well your agenda 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:25.840
 the crosshairs of the kites or replaced by a new one more faithful 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:31.580
 it will be there where it is subtle under the screen to show the health 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:33.480
 it's pretty good 

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:35.090
 rose curious to see 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:40.060
 adjusted adjusted d of dozens of minors and adjusted logos of the progression 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.170
 the loss of fixation of the squad leader after the worst that 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:46.950
 I understand the in certain movements 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.140
 the stable president of the pretextex train shelf 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:53.030
 with the video you can see a video that sometimes on the top 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:54.680
 short concentre 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:59.070
 oo small flashes as if to overcome the train to guard against fraud 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.110
 too much alive does not provoke 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:02.870
 Causes especially when watching videos 

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:06.500
 I think it's a little fucked up because when you catch a billion k catches 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:09.850
 Anyway, it's really Jose's already low and put them 

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:12.999
 lowest still looks very fucking 

00:02:12.999 --> 00:02:15.709
 so they are in soap accorsi 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:19.420
 the three icons we had so festive problems with disappearances 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:22.900
 spontaneous the squad we talked about the specified surface 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:25.039
 row specializations 

00:02:25.039 --> 00:02:27.189
 the activity see as pipe 

00:02:27.189 --> 00:02:31.339
 and the dead teammates and well some menu options 

00:02:31.339 --> 00:02:33.259
 privacy of the games 

00:02:33.259 --> 00:02:37.689
 it's about all that is missing that I do not know if I can nap a possible 

00:02:37.689 --> 00:02:40.559
 plot of us that's why I found out that the product is not 

00:02:40.559 --> 00:02:41.700
 at least we are going to do 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:42.900
 that may be what he knows 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:46.310
 I put it on and if you can not fuck it, they talk about love, which is that it's a 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:48.989
 true party because sometimes 

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:52.069
 in the volume quite a tubi diego still 

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:54.359
 I know how to measure so much 

00:02:54.359 --> 00:02:55.779
 United 

00:02:55.779 --> 00:02:57.059
 the sip 

00:02:57.059 --> 00:02:59.209
 like solid and weird stuff 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:01.029
 blacksmiths 

00:03:01.029 --> 00:03:03.170
 but that there is video 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:08.070
 and I went through the temper and today's resident evil 4 part 2 is that great 

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:10.859
 screen per hour a tournament that has come out 

00:03:10.859 --> 00:03:12.079
 the bonus that 

00:03:12.079 --> 00:03:14.369
 give him his long this very good video 

00:03:14.369 --> 00:03:18.209
 I think there are people very concerned about the final outcome of the game in 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:21.579
 Many people come to take their hands to Ivan's head 

00:03:21.579 --> 00:03:24.539
 not for that some graphics are not 

00:03:24.539 --> 00:03:28.789
 solitos alcoba will improve something in the final version since being 

00:03:28.789 --> 00:03:30.289
 disposable and 

00:03:30.289 --> 00:03:33.399
 it showed the final version will be much smaller to download so it 

00:03:33.399 --> 00:03:38.129
 submit a little bit on the other hand nacho mañó second many yes bays and 

00:03:38.129 --> 00:03:40.889
 obsessive for celebrations 

00:03:40.889 --> 00:03:42.599
 yes to say that 

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:47.219
 palace portion for bad now attached city also bad we play what 

00:03:47.219 --> 00:03:48.200
 buy mohmand 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:52.010
 is the program very well that relationships as well as knows and as 

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:55.189
 is chaired and we have to change 

00:03:55.189 --> 00:03:57.349
 the mono version 

00:03:57.349 --> 00:04:00.449
 it happened to him of ready before that garzón has not committed a theft not only not 

00:04:00.449 --> 00:04:02.359
 solves the final version 

00:04:02.359 --> 00:04:06.439
 two for other things do not go with the mep things happen to me to hold servers 

00:04:06.439 --> 00:04:09.249
 dedicated and do not go 

00:04:09.249 --> 00:04:10.999
 sometimes 

00:04:10.999 --> 00:04:14.619
 sometimes yes I notice something that I met him uploading logical means he was wearing and 

00:04:14.619 --> 00:04:16.560
 this is grass before the ticos 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:20.060
 if you have a market only 3 of the dunga do not go well of all is 

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:22.109
 quite 

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:24.750
 the stars of houston - the next
