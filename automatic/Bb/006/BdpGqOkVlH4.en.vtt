it's<00:02:28.019> upgraded<00:02:28.380> through<00:02:28.980> cydia<00:02:29.420> you<00:02:30.420> have<00:02:30.660> to

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
it's upgraded through cydia you have to

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:32.630 
it's upgraded through cydia you have to
manually<00:02:31.140> check<00:02:31.290> for<00:02:31.739> your<00:02:31.890> upgrades<00:02:32.280> so<00:02:32.580> you

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
manually check for your upgrades so you

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:35.509 
manually check for your upgrades so you
every<00:02:33.360> day<00:02:33.660> or<00:02:33.840> two<00:02:33.980> probably<00:02:34.980> checking<00:02:35.280> it

00:02:35.509 --> 00:02:35.519 
every day or two probably checking it

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:38.390 
every day or two probably checking it
already<00:02:35.819> but<00:02:36.630> just<00:02:37.080> be<00:02:37.200> sure<00:02:37.230> to<00:02:37.560> check<00:02:37.590> so
