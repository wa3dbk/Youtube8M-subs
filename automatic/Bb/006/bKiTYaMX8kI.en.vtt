00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:05.249
 we also see a spokesman for the vw-werk Ingo quite openly 

00:00:05.249 --> 00:00:09.190
 mourns what many Germans are mourning in the last beetle 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.960
 Gerold today in Puebla from the band 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.060
 and that is indeed the one in which he is except this author 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:21.009
 it's not just a car but a cult item 

00:00:21.009 --> 00:00:24.709
 The beetle is nearly 22 million times 

00:00:25.509 --> 00:00:29.029
 been built largely unchanged and 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:32.029
 then matured into a legend 

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:37.770
 To become a myth if you can put it that way, the OSC started working in 38 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.510
 Circumstance that is still standing out of a factory 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:45.330
 The Nazis had designed and built the car itself 

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:49.700
 Power through joy bring many people who later Germany has 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:54.210
 it brought simply mobility who has not experiences with these Kefer 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.920
 connected and still connects them today 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:01.060
 Mockers have said they never had so much laughter around 

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:04.340
 built to give them so little room but 

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:07.700
 Miquel Ferrer one of the most reliable cars from German production 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.800
 and that no one she can plentifully told her she with this model 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:14.810
 last words in Mexico 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:19.040
 again and again roles there are much colder today than taxis 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:23.420
 through the streets and will probably do so for years 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:28.610
 Boxer engine was indestructible if you like the car but corresponds 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:31.900
 no longer the modern technical requirements 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:36.910
 and is therefore sent by the vw board on the old part before today's El 

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:40.000
 not assistant they see there the last beetle 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.300
 from Mexican production with a plaque against Wolfsburg shows his 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:47.460
 By the way, they Nazis specially for the production this August 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:48.830
 have founded 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:49.900
 mourner 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:51.110
 a little sadness 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:53.930
 but these are sections 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:54.820
 Sometime 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:55.960
 it is over 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:57.080
 and since 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:59.550
 The beetle seems to be moving 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:02.290
 injured 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:07.540
 he will not move to a street in Mexico or anywhere but the one 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:10.399
 vw group gentlemen have decided 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:12.759
 this beetle you see there 

00:02:12.759 --> 00:02:14.129
 with a few others 

00:02:14.129 --> 00:02:15.969
 directly to the museum 

00:02:15.969 --> 00:02:17.239
 Wolfsburg 

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:20.239
 where he belongs 

00:02:20.929 --> 00:02:22.759
 a car alone but small 

00:02:22.759 --> 00:02:25.839
 historical events can say something 

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:28.709
 that is the live pictures 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:31.709
 from Mexico with the appropriate music 

00:02:32.509 --> 00:02:35.429
 this pleasing sounds at this farewell 

00:02:35.429 --> 00:02:38.659
 a tv team is a mobile cult object 

00:02:38.659 --> 00:02:40.599
 many Germans I am quite sure 

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:42.489
 a bit too today 

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:45.489
 wistful 

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:02.430
 Often ladies and gentlemen know why 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:05.059
 married in the beetle returns 

00:03:05.059 --> 00:03:08.749
 he got his name from English there he was called by 

00:03:08.749 --> 00:03:09.589
 one 

00:03:09.589 --> 00:03:14.209
 to do the hunting Franz already do everything to heat America Beetle designates exactly 

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:18.099
 as a screaming child has afforded help for the first time and that is 

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:19.829
 translated 

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:22.859
 and this name has then prevailed in Germany and if you 

00:03:22.859 --> 00:03:24.389
 Look closely at him 

00:03:24.389 --> 00:03:27.949
 Can one empathize with what this choice is thought to have by name 

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:51.809
 there are no robots 

00:03:51.809 --> 00:03:55.589
 Helpers including Hesse built longer were almost unchanged as very 

00:03:55.589 --> 00:03:56.809
 exemplary 

00:03:56.809 --> 00:03:59.649
 Ships planes and work can 

00:03:59.649 --> 00:04:01.969
 it is not a car 5 

00:04:01.969 --> 00:04:04.149
 to have been produced 

00:04:04.149 --> 00:04:08.349
 Hofdichter successor to the beetle of the VW Golf could still make it 

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:09.429
 but he already has 

00:04:09.429 --> 00:04:12.849
 now reaches the fifth generation and is thorough inside and out 

00:04:12.849 --> 00:04:16.900
 renovated and changed that Canon Kefer did not say the engine remained 

00:04:16.899 --> 00:04:19.899
 easily the body remained the same except for a few 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:23.099
 and write something bigger 

00:04:23.099 --> 00:04:24.650
 leave this car 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:28.800
 38 now could keep in the production of meat 

00:04:29.389 --> 00:04:30.949
 and that speaks Prof 

00:04:30.949 --> 00:04:33.949
 if we are talking about the reliability of this vehicle 

00:04:34.719 --> 00:04:40.150
 the beetle would not have been constructed so stably, he would surely have this time 

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:42.930
 not so under pressure in production either 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:46.770
 But now he is finally over more and this man has the task 

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:52.169
 the kitty beetles 

00:04:52.169 --> 00:04:55.169
 to make another final check Moto Astron 

00:04:56.539 --> 00:04:58.860
 quite obviously, though the beetle 

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:01.889
 the Nevada controlled this mother will no longer need there we are 

00:05:01.889 --> 00:05:03.319
 sure rolls as I said 

00:05:03.319 --> 00:05:04.419
 in the museum 

00:05:04.419 --> 00:05:06.809
 to Wolfsburg 

00:05:06.809 --> 00:05:09.529
 accompany both teenagers 

00:05:09.529 --> 00:05:12.150
 to be taken seriously 

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:15.449
 while still a badge on it 

00:05:15.449 --> 00:05:18.789
 so that everything has its correctness that applies also in Mexico not only in 

00:05:18.789 --> 00:05:19.919
 Wolfsburg 

00:05:19.919 --> 00:05:23.160
 and the corporate owners do not see much Mexicans too tenth 

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:25.529
 Emissaries out 

00:05:25.529 --> 00:05:27.569
 the vw-works 

00:05:27.569 --> 00:05:29.839
 Erwin Group headquarters 

00:05:29.839 --> 00:05:31.069
 For this 

00:05:31.069 --> 00:05:32.279
 moment 

00:05:32.279 --> 00:05:35.279
 obviously with experience 

00:05:35.819 --> 00:05:41.240
 since it is exactly the production volume 21 million 529 thousands thankful 

00:05:43.069 --> 00:05:47.139
 that is the last beetle nearly 22 million 

00:05:47.139 --> 00:05:49.979
 the vehicles had given this war 

00:05:49.979 --> 00:05:51.290
 gone days 

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:55.069
 I think that was right to appreciate this moment son 

00:05:55.069 --> 00:05:57.539
 that was the news only 

00:05:57.539 --> 00:06:00.490
 make the beetle with a bit of economy third or returns as 

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:02.550
 also to economic parliament 

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:05.090
 detailed news that in turn with us 

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:08.540
 17 o'clock ORF with the economy and now it continues with a documentation 

00:06:09.319 --> 00:06:10.150
 the truth 

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:11.469
 Schenz Bank it's about 

00:06:11.469 --> 00:06:12.389
 which games 

00:06:12.389 --> 00:06:12.949
 23
