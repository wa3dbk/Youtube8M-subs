00:00:01.839 --> 00:00:05.660
 or the national sports center papendal became vitesse daily training sessions 

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:08.760
 and this week they are completely devoted to the competition 

00:00:10.739 --> 00:00:15.449
 is the team of john van de hum and old ajax goalkeeper stanley menzo it still has 

00:00:15.449 --> 00:00:19.469
 not lost and moreover Jan van der Heijden pulled the midfielder 

00:00:19.469 --> 00:00:22.489
 already switched last week and ajax left where is is the 13th playro 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.319
 the pain of having to leave ajax 

00:00:27.319 --> 00:00:30.300
 thus has a few years 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.110
 look i saw al haj come that i do not differ much and then get it 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:36.870
 you have to choose for yourself 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.450
 hence not with vitesse 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:43.460
 and germany or that conversation with the trainer and actor thereby becomes every 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:46.450
 perspectives were with ajax 

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:49.829
 I have drawn my conclusions looking for a new club 

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:53.050
 nevertheless I can imagine how long the youth education sure it isn't 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:55.090
 was easy to leave 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:58.170
 beijing anp ajax has a festive club and 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:02.350
 but good not for yourself something disadvantaged 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:06.540
 if i am not going to play thereby have to go to another club official jade 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.780
 minutes of play work along with it and where is that orphan? 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.930
 Perspective Some players who have to leave Ajax are severely disappointed 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.640
 but in the case of jan arie van eijden there is no question of no 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:18.850
 on the contrary 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:22.220
 It is of course realistic young un people I think 

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:27.420
 but to be the game but guess it reveals that to him 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.300
 and this season then you can sit down for a very long time but you 

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:33.510
 can also 

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:37.250
 The use you make of the movie is running at that time 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:40.050
 The fact that we had a very different club also interested in January 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:41.860
 says i think enough 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:45.680
 that that he was open that he was ready to take he 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:46.610
 in the end 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:49.090
 maybe quite a bit disappointing you always hope you 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:50.270
 of course with ajax 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:52.380
 it can stay 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:57.500
 yes entered into action and received by the boys and years from now it is 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:59.240
 vitesse player and 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:02.149
 yes ribbon and then he will be there for them is very special that it is forthcoming 

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:03.540
 friday wallays 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.870
 but i have nothing of a disappointment and that he is really somewhere 

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:09.829
 absolutely was not the case with ajax 

00:02:09.829 --> 00:02:11.079
 I am now 

00:02:11.079 --> 00:02:14.829
 not a single game run in the past week is good 

00:02:15.329 --> 00:02:20.650
 i want the whole country to see what i am worth also good football and also 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:25.040
 keep developing well-known couple of guys so I don't know anyone 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.989
 astra nice boys and 

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:30.949
 wait well taken care of 

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:33.859
 mollema who always found interesting player and his staff before 

00:02:33.859 --> 00:02:38.629
 That made his debut made as well as substitute although helped to 

00:02:38.629 --> 00:02:41.629
 dragging out that victory against Utrecht 

00:02:42.159 --> 00:02:43.650
 I am very happy with him 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:47.440
 for me we are a multifunctional player to vote a little naively 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:50.309
 remain animals that can play in multiple positions 

00:02:50.309 --> 00:02:53.549
 He can be a decentral four points behind on six one left on it 

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:58.040
 Midfield are previous trainers that are yes the ideal players 

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:01.689
 van der heijden has played in the past two seasons 

00:03:01.689 --> 00:03:05.919
 rental base for Willem 2 but that is not comparable with his current transfer 

00:03:06.639 --> 00:03:09.659
 but now vitesse is a very nice club for me 

00:03:09.659 --> 00:03:12.369
 yes that's right because otherwise 

00:03:12.369 --> 00:03:15.369
 I did a second campaign again and it goes with vitesse 

00:03:16.749 --> 00:03:19.849
 it is perhaps a stepping stone thought vitesse is now good about a new plan 

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:21.249
 about one from the source 

00:03:21.249 --> 00:03:24.249
 that is really a step higher than it took with a second study 

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:30.069
 yes is right think that good team csw have many ambitions good players too 

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:30.809
 set 

00:03:30.809 --> 00:03:34.589
 think it's definitely a step higher and that is not least because of john 

00:03:34.589 --> 00:03:35.230
 van den brom 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:38.750
 last season he played European football with the ado and now work with it 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:41.910
 vitesse a good start to the competition but what is his secret 

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:48.089
 that is often asked I am just training that is intensively busy 

00:03:48.089 --> 00:03:49.729
 is with those guests 

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:55.839
 during the training also made fun but I do expect a lot yes number 

00:03:55.839 --> 00:03:57.900
 points much experience 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:00.900
 8 8 

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:06.179
 a lower rate is possible 

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:10.459
 the 

00:04:12.469 --> 00:04:14.859
 normal 

00:04:14.859 --> 00:04:19.539
 apple devices bart koubaa agreement can come get franc 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:22.309
 anp 

00:04:22.309 --> 00:04:23.749
 adha 

00:04:23.749 --> 00:04:26.749
 fall 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:31.069
 they looked carefully at how they are doing 

00:04:31.069 --> 00:04:34.129
 Friday's statements are still unclear 

00:04:34.129 --> 00:04:37.869
 anyway nice to be this anyway thanks my him at ajax 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:40.350
 and 

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:44.890
 that at another time comes to us that there are with great confidence 

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:47.659
 gained the last one 

00:04:47.659 --> 00:04:51.080
 two weeks in the last matches are actually three Flemish 

00:04:51.789 --> 00:04:55.129
 so save in good spirits towards next Friday only 

00:04:55.129 --> 00:04:57.599
 what will that happen next Friday 

00:04:57.599 --> 00:04:59.819
 three points 

00:04:59.819 --> 00:05:02.879
 everyone says that in itself for a year now with a little bit of amsterdam 

00:05:02.879 --> 00:05:04.379
 promote 

00:05:04.379 --> 00:05:10.060
 nea good i think we should go and play for fruit and the ajax 

00:05:10.059 --> 00:05:11.949
 make it difficult and you never know the case
