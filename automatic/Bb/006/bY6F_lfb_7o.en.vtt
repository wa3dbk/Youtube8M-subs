00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.010

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:26.280

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:56.820
 and continue kneading until a 

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:56.820
 soft dough 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:13.090

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:16.179

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:46.049

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:56.440

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:04.990
