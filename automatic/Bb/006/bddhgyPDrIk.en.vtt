thread<00:03:25.870> through<00:03:26.019> a<00:03:26.079> hole<00:03:26.319> in<00:03:26.349> the<00:03:26.650> back<00:03:26.829> and

00:03:27.089 --> 00:03:27.099 
thread through a hole in the back and

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:29.339 
thread through a hole in the back and
then<00:03:27.849> basically<00:03:28.660> put<00:03:28.840> the<00:03:28.900> breast<00:03:29.019> piece<00:03:29.200> back

00:03:29.339 --> 00:03:29.349 
then basically put the breast piece back

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:32.580 
then basically put the breast piece back
on<00:03:29.470> so<00:03:30.459> be<00:03:31.209> careful<00:03:31.540> with<00:03:31.900> that<00:03:31.959> because<00:03:32.260> I

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:32.590 
on so be careful with that because I

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:34.050 
on so be careful with that because I
didn't<00:03:32.799> know<00:03:32.919> that<00:03:33.069> was<00:03:33.340> her<00:03:33.459> breast<00:03:33.700> piece<00:03:33.880> I

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:34.060 
didn't know that was her breast piece I

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:35.099 
didn't know that was her breast piece I
knew<00:03:34.359> that<00:03:34.480> something<00:03:34.630> had<00:03:34.780> to<00:03:34.870> come<00:03:35.019> off

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:35.109 
knew that something had to come off

00:03:35.109 --> 00:03:36.690 
knew that something had to come off
because<00:03:35.260> otherwise<00:03:35.530> accessory<00:03:36.400> you<00:03:36.489> want<00:03:36.639> to

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:36.700 
because otherwise accessory you want to

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:39.059 
because otherwise accessory you want to
fit<00:03:36.819> in<00:03:36.940> but<00:03:37.750> I<00:03:38.139> didn't<00:03:38.650> know<00:03:38.709> was<00:03:38.829> the<00:03:38.889> breast

00:03:39.059 --> 00:03:39.069 
fit in but I didn't know was the breast

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:40.289 
fit in but I didn't know was the breast
pieces<00:03:39.250> I<00:03:39.370> tried<00:03:39.549> taking<00:03:39.669> off<00:03:39.940> their<00:03:40.120> whole

00:03:40.289 --> 00:03:40.299 
pieces I tried taking off their whole

00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:42.479 
pieces I tried taking off their whole
wad<00:03:40.599> her<00:03:40.810> whole<00:03:40.989> body<00:03:41.200> which<00:03:41.799> could<00:03:42.400> have

00:03:42.479 --> 00:03:42.489 
wad her whole body which could have

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:45.370 
wad her whole body which could have
ended<00:03:42.819> very<00:03:42.880> badly<00:03:43.209> so<00:03:44.199> just<00:03:44.440> be<00:03:44.530> aware<00:03:44.560> about

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:45.380 
ended very badly so just be aware about

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:48.670 
ended very badly so just be aware about
in<00:03:46.190> terms<00:03:46.430> of<00:03:46.640> the<00:03:47.450> figure<00:03:47.750> overall<00:03:48.170> itself<00:03:48.500> is

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:48.680 
in terms of the figure overall itself is

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:52.000 
in terms of the figure overall itself is
as<00:03:48.890> I<00:03:49.190> said<00:03:49.400> it's<00:03:49.520> very<00:03:49.670> pretty<00:03:50.350> so<00:03:51.350> some<00:03:51.950> of

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:52.010 
as I said it's very pretty so some of

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:55.480 
as I said it's very pretty so some of
the<00:03:52.100> details<00:03:52.430> that<00:03:52.460> they<00:03:52.610> added<00:03:52.880> was<00:03:54.490> you

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:55.490 
the details that they added was you

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:56.920 
the details that they added was you
might<00:03:55.640> have<00:03:55.760> seen<00:03:55.910> it<00:03:56.030> it's<00:03:56.360> coming<00:03:56.690> it's

might have seen it it's coming it's

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:58.060 
might have seen it it's coming it's

00:03:58.060 --> 00:03:58.070 
probably gonna be in the beginning of

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:00.880 
probably gonna be in the beginning of
the<00:03:58.190> video<00:03:58.310> but<00:03:58.580> the<00:03:59.420> base<00:03:59.600> itself<00:04:00.020> it<00:04:00.710> has<00:04:00.860> a

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:00.890 
the video but the base itself it has a

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:04.090 
the video but the base itself it has a
space<00:04:01.250> like<00:04:02.110> hemisphere<00:04:03.110> basically<00:04:03.650> and<00:04:03.920> yeah

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:04.100 
space like hemisphere basically and yeah

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:05.770 
space like hemisphere basically and yeah

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:15.350 
unnatural base itself and again like the

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:17.710 
unnatural base itself and again like the
other<00:04:15.860> one<00:04:16.160> this<00:04:17.030> is<00:04:17.090> pretty<00:04:17.300> much<00:04:17.360> the<00:04:17.540> same

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:30.880 
this one so this you have two sorts ones
I<00:04:28.970> guess<00:04:29.750> a<00:04:29.780> broadsword<00:04:30.290> I<00:04:30.560> don't<00:04:30.770> know<00:04:30.830> we

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:30.890 
I guess a broadsword I don't know we

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:33.220 
I guess a broadsword I don't know we
call<00:04:31.130> it<00:04:31.160> and<00:04:31.790> ones<00:04:32.060> like<00:04:32.240> a<00:04:32.360> more<00:04:32.570> curved<00:04:32.930> kind

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:33.230 
call it and ones like a more curved kind

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:36.820 
call it and ones like a more curved kind
of<00:04:33.290> thing<00:04:34.030> so<00:04:35.030> the<00:04:35.360> sword<00:04:35.600> itself<00:04:35.960> they're

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:36.830 
of thing so the sword itself they're

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:38.650 
of thing so the sword itself they're
kind<00:04:37.070> of<00:04:37.100> different<00:04:37.400> in<00:04:37.760> the<00:04:37.850> sense<00:04:38.090> that<00:04:38.180> one

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:38.660 
kind of different in the sense that one

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:41.050 
kind of different in the sense that one
is<00:04:38.840> sort<00:04:39.050> a<00:04:39.290> -<00:04:39.470> well<00:04:40.280> they're<00:04:40.400> both<00:04:40.430> two<00:04:40.760> parts

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:41.060 
is sort a - well they're both two parts

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:42.850 
is sort a - well they're both two parts
but<00:04:41.210> one<00:04:41.600> of<00:04:41.630> the<00:04:41.780> swords<00:04:42.050> for<00:04:42.380> this<00:04:42.530> one<00:04:42.710> on

end<00:05:05.870> this<00:05:06.560> one<00:05:06.740> in<00:05:06.980> there<00:05:07.760> as<00:05:07.940> well<00:05:08.150> and<00:05:08.360> then

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:08.510 
end this one in there as well and then

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:11.140 
end this one in there as well and then
just<00:05:08.540> fading<00:05:08.900> it<00:05:08.990> together<00:05:09.970> and<00:05:10.970> then

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:11.150 
just fading it together and then

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:13.270 
just fading it together and then
basically<00:05:11.840> the<00:05:12.110> other<00:05:12.320> two<00:05:12.620> ports<00:05:12.950> that<00:05:13.100> came

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:13.280 
basically the other two ports that came

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:16.330 
basically the other two ports that came
with<00:05:13.460> her<00:05:13.670> was<00:05:14.030> or<00:05:14.450> rather<00:05:15.020> were<00:05:15.320> the<00:05:16.100> two

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:16.340 
with her was or rather were the two

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:18.880 
with her was or rather were the two
wings<00:05:16.580> on<00:05:16.760> the<00:05:17.090> back<00:05:17.380> these<00:05:18.380> wings<00:05:18.680> were<00:05:18.860> a

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:18.890 
wings on the back these wings were a

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:21.520 
wings on the back these wings were a
pain<00:05:19.220> to<00:05:19.370> put<00:05:19.520> in<00:05:19.610> especially<00:05:20.270> I<00:05:20.660> believe<00:05:21.260> her

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:21.530 
pain to put in especially I believe her

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:25.300 
pain to put in especially I believe her
right<00:05:21.770> so<00:05:22.730> her<00:05:23.000> right<00:05:23.180> yeah<00:05:23.360> this<00:05:23.540> one<00:05:24.310> because

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:25.310 
right so her right yeah this one because

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:27.760 
right so her right yeah this one because
at<00:05:25.760> least<00:05:25.880> from<00:05:26.120> mine<00:05:26.300> the<00:05:26.480> whole<00:05:26.690> is<00:05:26.930> not<00:05:27.080> was

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:27.770 
at least from mine the whole is not was

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:30.460 
at least from mine the whole is not was
not<00:05:27.980> big<00:05:28.340> enough<00:05:28.370> or<00:05:28.790> it<00:05:29.120> was<00:05:29.420> you<00:05:30.200> could<00:05:30.350> fit

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:30.470 
not big enough or it was you could fit

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:31.900 
not big enough or it was you could fit
it<00:05:30.590> in<00:05:30.710> bow<00:05:30.860> it's<00:05:31.040> kind<00:05:31.220> of<00:05:31.280> loose<00:05:31.460> I<00:05:31.730> was

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:31.910 
it in bow it's kind of loose I was

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:33.100 
it in bow it's kind of loose I was
afraid<00:05:32.090> that<00:05:32.180> my<00:05:32.360> fall<00:05:32.540> out<00:05:32.690> if<00:05:32.780> I<00:05:32.870> just<00:05:32.990> look

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:33.110 
afraid that my fall out if I just look

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:34.090 
afraid that my fall out if I just look
left<00:05:33.650> it<00:05:33.800> there

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:34.100 
left it there

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:35.590 
left it there
so<00:05:34.280> they<00:05:34.370> connected<00:05:34.820> kind<00:05:35.120> of<00:05:35.210> had<00:05:35.330> to<00:05:35.420> shove

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:35.600 
so they connected kind of had to shove

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:37.630 
so they connected kind of had to shove
it<00:05:35.780> in<00:05:35.870> and<00:05:36.050> they<00:05:36.170> make<00:05:36.740> the<00:05:36.890> hole<00:05:37.040> bigger<00:05:37.310> or

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:37.640 
it in and they make the hole bigger or

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:39.340 
it in and they make the hole bigger or
force<00:05:37.910> the<00:05:38.060> hole<00:05:38.240> to<00:05:38.690> be<00:05:38.720> a<00:05:38.840> little<00:05:38.990> bit<00:05:39.110> bigger

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:39.350 
force the hole to be a little bit bigger

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:41.200 
force the hole to be a little bit bigger
which<00:05:39.530> I'm<00:05:40.040> not<00:05:40.250> comfortable<00:05:40.460> with<00:05:40.820> because

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:41.210 
which I'm not comfortable with because

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:43.180 
which I'm not comfortable with because
because<00:05:41.960> of<00:05:41.990> the<00:05:42.080> way<00:05:42.380> that<00:05:42.590> the<00:05:42.770> wing<00:05:42.980> is

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:43.190 
because of the way that the wing is

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:44.830 
because of the way that the wing is
shaped<00:05:43.790> I<00:05:43.970> was<00:05:44.210> afraid<00:05:44.360> that<00:05:44.450> as<00:05:44.630> I<00:05:44.750> was

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:44.840 
shaped I was afraid that as I was

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:46.480 
shaped I was afraid that as I was
forcing<00:05:45.560> it<00:05:45.650> in<00:05:45.740> there<00:05:45.860> that<00:05:46.010> would<00:05:46.070> break<00:05:46.310> off

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:46.490 
forcing it in there that would break off

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:48.690 
forcing it in there that would break off
like<00:05:47.000> a<00:05:47.090> part<00:05:47.360> of

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:48.700 
like a part of

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:51.210 
like a part of
I<00:05:48.760> guess<00:05:49.240> so<00:05:50.230> yeah<00:05:50.260> be<00:05:50.710> careful<00:05:50.830> with<00:05:51.100> that

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:51.220 
I guess so yeah be careful with that

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:57.990 
I guess so yeah be careful with that
maybe<00:05:51.520> that's<00:05:51.760> just<00:05:51.850> mine<00:05:52.120> but<00:05:55.410> also<00:05:56.700> there<00:05:57.700> is

00:05:57.990 --> 00:05:58.000 
maybe that's just mine but also there is

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.800 
maybe that's just mine but also there is
I<00:05:58.450> noticed<00:05:59.380> one<00:05:59.800> of<00:06:00.040> one<00:06:00.730> obvious<00:06:01.120> kind<00:06:01.540> of<00:06:01.660> not

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:01.810 
I noticed one of one obvious kind of not

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:11.360 
I noticed one of one obvious kind of not
quality<00:06:02.170> issue<00:06:02.320> but<00:06:02.650> flaw<00:06:02.980> is<00:06:03.610> that<00:06:08.430> is<00:06:09.430> that

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:11.370 
quality issue but flaw is that is that

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:16.170 
quality issue but flaw is that is that
on<00:06:12.370> her<00:06:13.360> left<00:06:13.810> breast<00:06:14.680> piece<00:06:15.090> there<00:06:16.090> are

00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:16.180 
on her left breast piece there are

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:22.130 
on her left breast piece there are
speckles<00:06:16.690> Oh

00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:22.140 

00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:24.390 

it's<00:06:23.140> not<00:06:23.320> gonna<00:06:23.440> come<00:06:23.620> out<00:06:23.740> of<00:06:23.770> the<00:06:23.950> camera<00:06:24.340> I

00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:24.400 
it's not gonna come out of the camera I

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:27.390 
it's not gonna come out of the camera I
think<00:06:24.720> but<00:06:25.720> anyways<00:06:26.200> under<00:06:26.500> her<00:06:26.920> left<00:06:27.160> side

00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:27.400 
think but anyways under her left side

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:30.180 
think but anyways under her left side
there<00:06:28.240> are<00:06:28.270> speckles<00:06:29.080> of<00:06:29.170> gold<00:06:29.230> paints<00:06:29.920> that

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:30.190 
there are speckles of gold paints that

00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:33.270 
there are speckles of gold paints that
should<00:06:31.000> not<00:06:31.150> be<00:06:31.180> on<00:06:31.420> there<00:06:31.810> so<00:06:32.770> yeah<00:06:32.950> there<00:06:33.190> is

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:33.280 
should not be on there so yeah there is

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:38.670 
should not be on there so yeah there is
so<00:06:34.030> I<00:06:34.390> mean<00:06:35.200> it's<00:06:35.650> okay<00:06:36.330> but<00:06:37.330> at<00:06:38.200> the<00:06:38.320> same<00:06:38.470> time

00:06:38.670 --> 00:06:38.680 
so I mean it's okay but at the same time

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:41.640 
so I mean it's okay but at the same time
that's<00:06:38.920> still<00:06:39.160> this<00:06:39.760> is<00:06:39.910> $140<00:06:40.630> 15<00:06:40.930> I<00:06:41.020> figure<00:06:41.350> I

00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:41.650 
that's still this is $140 15 I figure I

00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:44.370 
that's still this is $140 15 I figure I
expected<00:06:42.520> there<00:06:43.240> to<00:06:43.270> be<00:06:43.450> no<00:06:43.660> politician<00:06:44.260> at

00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:44.380 
expected there to be no politician at

00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:46.470 
expected there to be no politician at
all<00:06:44.500> but<00:06:44.710> it's<00:06:45.370> a<00:06:45.400> very<00:06:45.580> minor<00:06:45.790> one<00:06:45.910> unless<00:06:46.300> you

00:06:46.470 --> 00:06:46.480 
all but it's a very minor one unless you

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:47.970 
all but it's a very minor one unless you
look<00:06:46.600> very<00:06:46.840> closely<00:06:47.080> you<00:06:47.350> can't<00:06:47.590> really<00:06:47.710> tell

00:06:47.970 --> 00:06:47.980 
look very closely you can't really tell

00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:51.420 
look very closely you can't really tell
so<00:06:48.610> it's<00:06:48.790> okay<00:06:49.590> it's<00:06:50.590> okay

00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:51.430 
so it's okay it's okay

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:54.180 
so it's okay it's okay
and<00:06:51.880> I<00:06:52.180> believe<00:06:52.450> there<00:06:52.690> was<00:06:52.720> one<00:06:52.950> this<00:06:53.950> you

00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:54.190 
and I believe there was one this you

00:06:54.190 --> 00:06:55.740 
and I believe there was one this you
definitely<00:06:54.550> can't<00:06:54.700> get<00:06:54.790> this<00:06:54.970> on<00:06:55.120> video<00:06:55.360> but

00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:55.750 
definitely can't get this on video but

00:06:55.750 --> 00:06:57.780 
definitely can't get this on video but
on<00:06:56.110> one<00:06:56.410> of<00:06:56.440> our<00:06:56.620> sites<00:06:56.860> there's<00:06:57.220> also<00:06:57.370> a<00:06:57.490> good

00:06:57.780 --> 00:06:57.790 
on one of our sites there's also a good

00:06:57.790 --> 00:07:01.470 
on one of our sites there's also a good
streak<00:06:58.450> kind<00:06:58.960> of<00:06:59.050> which<00:06:59.890> is<00:07:00.070> again<00:07:00.340> kind<00:07:01.330> of

00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:01.480 
streak kind of which is again kind of

00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:03.570 
streak kind of which is again kind of
not<00:07:01.660> what<00:07:01.810> I<00:07:01.840> expected<00:07:02.320> but<00:07:02.500> okay

00:07:03.570 --> 00:07:03.580 
not what I expected but okay

00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:05.340 
not what I expected but okay
