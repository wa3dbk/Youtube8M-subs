00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:05.630
 or pretty well happy for the bowl and 

00:00:03.919 --> 00:00:10.260
 most of all also happy for the 

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:13.380
 result that puts us up there 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:16.170
 an important difference of points 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:18.510
 about the second over the third and there's 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.520
 to keep working and every day 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.010
 we are closer to the goal that we 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.720
 we draw but we have to keep working 

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:27.510
 when we say with the hobby delivery 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.289
 of the crop nothing that very happy 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:33.600
 that ovation 

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:35.860
 thank you very much for all that applause 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.150
 I had said it when when I arrived 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:39.670
 do not 

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:41.730
 it was going to cost me a lot to adapt to the field 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:44.070
 synthetic 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:48.030
 I was 10 years old that did not come here to the 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:51.600
 Mexican league was a matter of adapting 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:54.600
 and I think it cost me a lot 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:58.329
 during last season but this one 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:00.790
 season with the new position 

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:05.480
 I have improved a lot and 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:09.920
 and is already fully adapted but already 

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:13.159
 80 or 90 percent already called adapted 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:15.100
 yes I also think that the first 

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:18.630
 had not done much for 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:21.490
 get a bowl but good sometimes 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:25.630
 a thing 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:29.170
 for badly stopped I was they are to the 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:33.189
 situation of the criminal and the tie but the 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:37.020
 team kept calm and with Carlos I 

00:01:33.189 --> 00:01:38.640
 like when I play convert 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.740
 in this case it serves to give a 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.020
 team tranquility after really 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.909
 interests me and prioritizes much more than the 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.710
 Danish team but good if I can 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:50.880
 convert and help to win 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:52.530
 points much better if it 's from all 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.900
 Really 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:57.180
 this good is a team we also 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:02:01.049
 we lost in the cup because we wanted 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:03.720
 all go through and keep fighting her 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:06.390
 but good today we have another party 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:08.459
 another important commitment that good 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:11.640
 was for something they want to follow first and 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:14.069
 today really came back to do the 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:17.069
 cholos that brought us to the tip 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:19.620
 after two not-so-good matches or 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:22.650
 to the best that we give away but today today 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:25.319
 it was a great match against a great rival and 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:25.799
 very happy for everything say the goal that you 

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:28.790
 I say 

00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:28.790
 it's part of football
