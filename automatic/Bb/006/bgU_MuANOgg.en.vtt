 of religion with the theme of internet 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:12.300

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.680
 extraterrestrial intervention 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:16.730
 extraterrestrial that is that in a moment 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:19.200
 we were intervened by superior beings 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:19.739
 extraterrestrials and that's why we're like 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.530
