00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
also a bit things I haven't had a chance

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:39.410 
also a bit things I haven't had a chance
to<00:00:35.190> videotape<00:00:35.670> so<00:00:35.940> far<00:00:37.579> but<00:00:38.579> before<00:00:39.210> that

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
to videotape so far but before that

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.770 
to videotape so far but before that
let's<00:00:40.230> establish<00:00:40.769> what<00:00:41.670> goldfish<00:00:42.210> need<00:00:42.539> to

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
let's establish what goldfish need to

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.360 
let's establish what goldfish need to
survive<00:00:43.289> so<00:00:44.219> what<00:00:44.789> does<00:00:45.089> goldfish<00:00:46.219> need<00:00:47.219> in

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
survive so what does goldfish need in

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.790 
survive so what does goldfish need in
the<00:00:47.550> food<00:00:47.899> well<00:00:48.899> that's<00:00:49.140> a<00:00:49.260> pretty<00:00:49.499> good

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
the food well that's a pretty good

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.579 
the food well that's a pretty good
question<00:00:50.609> and<00:00:51.329> something<00:00:51.719> that<00:00:51.899> you<00:00:52.199> need<00:00:52.409> to

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:52.589 
question and something that you need to

00:00:52.589 --> 00:00:55.180 
question and something that you need to
consider<00:00:52.859> before<00:00:53.399> feeding<00:00:53.940> your<00:00:54.179> fish

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:55.190 
consider before feeding your fish

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:57.590 
consider before feeding your fish
goldfish<00:00:56.190> are<00:00:56.399> pretty<00:00:56.579> much<00:00:56.730> like<00:00:56.969> humans<00:00:57.420> and

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
goldfish are pretty much like humans and

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.660 
goldfish are pretty much like humans and
that<00:00:57.690> they<00:00:57.989> need<00:00:58.170> protein<00:00:58.739> vegetables<00:00:59.429> and

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
that they need protein vegetables and

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.009 
that they need protein vegetables and
minerals<00:01:00.030> to<00:01:00.920> survive<00:01:02.359> so<00:01:03.359> let's<00:01:03.569> take<00:01:03.809> a<00:01:03.839> look

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
minerals to survive so let's take a look

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:07.639 
minerals to survive so let's take a look
at<00:01:04.229> some<00:01:04.439> dried<00:01:04.799> foods<00:01:05.600> right<00:01:06.600> now<00:01:06.780> use<00:01:07.200> two

00:01:07.639 --> 00:01:07.649 
at some dried foods right now use two

00:01:07.649 --> 00:01:11.600 
at some dried foods right now use two
different<00:01:07.799> kinds<00:01:08.369> Hikari<00:01:09.000> gold<00:01:10.340> this<00:01:11.340> is<00:01:11.490> the

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
different kinds Hikari gold this is the

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.940 
different kinds Hikari gold this is the
green<00:01:11.850> bag<00:01:12.000> and<00:01:12.390> then<00:01:12.840> we<00:01:12.990> have<00:01:13.140> this<00:01:13.290> premium

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
green bag and then we have this premium

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.760 
green bag and then we have this premium
fancy<00:01:14.460> large<00:01:15.180> which<00:01:15.960> we<00:01:16.140> wanted<00:01:16.439> off<00:01:16.590> the

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
fancy large which we wanted off the

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.440 
fancy large which we wanted off the
internet<00:01:17.869> here<00:01:18.869> you<00:01:19.079> can<00:01:19.290> see<00:01:19.530> the<00:01:20.149> pandas<00:01:21.149> and

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
internet here you can see the pandas and

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.429 
internet here you can see the pandas and
we'll<00:01:21.659> hum<00:01:21.899> getting<00:01:22.409> fed<00:01:22.770> the<00:01:23.270> premium<00:01:24.439> it

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
we'll hum getting fed the premium it

we'll hum getting fed the premium it
stings<00:01:25.920> really<00:01:26.549> really<00:01:26.850> fast<00:01:27.119> it's<00:01:27.689> a<00:01:27.899> sinking

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
stings really really fast it's a sinking

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.770 
stings really really fast it's a sinking
pellet<00:01:28.680> I<00:01:29.000> haven't<00:01:30.000> pretty<00:01:30.270> soaked<00:01:30.600> these

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
pellet I haven't pretty soaked these

pellet I haven't pretty soaked these
this<00:01:31.110> is<00:01:31.320> how<00:01:31.530> fast<00:01:31.950> they<00:01:32.310> sink<00:01:32.759> fish<00:01:33.600> all<00:01:33.810> of

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
this is how fast they sink fish all of

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.550 
this is how fast they sink fish all of
them<00:01:34.140> so<00:01:34.860> and<00:01:35.240> here<00:01:36.240> just<00:01:36.990> to<00:01:37.170> show<00:01:37.200> some

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
them so and here just to show some

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.429 
them so and here just to show some
variation<00:01:38.009> this<00:01:38.670> is<00:01:38.909> the<00:01:39.270> other<00:01:39.509> tank<00:01:39.899> getting

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
variation this is the other tank getting

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:43.130 
variation this is the other tank getting
that<00:01:40.649> carrot<00:01:41.219> green<00:01:41.549> also<00:01:42.299> use<00:01:42.630> the<00:01:42.840> yellow

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
one before fish like them both reading

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.230 
one before fish like them both reading
and<00:01:46.590> they're<00:01:46.829> very<00:01:46.979> good<00:01:47.130> products<00:01:47.789> they<00:01:47.909> sink

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
and they're very good products they sink
