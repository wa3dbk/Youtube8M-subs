00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:54.280 

and<00:00:51.620> they<00:00:51.770> try<00:00:51.980> this<00:00:52.040> mud<00:00:53.080> the<00:00:54.080> mother

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:54.290

Trackmaster to locomotives and we'll see

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:01.810 
Trackmaster to locomotives and we'll see
how<00:01:00.230> it<00:01:00.290> goes<00:01:00.380> let's<00:01:00.980> have<00:01:01.190> a<00:01:01.220> good<00:01:01.400> look<00:01:01.580> at<00:01:01.730> in

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:01.820 
how it goes let's have a good look at in

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:13.460 
how it goes let's have a good look at in
there

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.050 

I'll<00:01:14.470> be<00:01:14.650> using<00:01:14.770> part<00:01:15.160> of<00:01:15.280> the<00:01:15.340> layout<00:01:15.580> today

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:16.060 
I'll be using part of the layout today

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:18.180 
I'll be using part of the layout today
got<00:01:16.720> it<00:01:16.810> all<00:01:16.930> coming<00:01:17.260> up<00:01:17.380> because<00:01:17.770> we've<00:01:18.010> been

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:18.190 
got it all coming up because we've been

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:29.420 
got it all coming up because we've been
doing<00:01:18.430> working<00:01:18.850> here

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.760 

all<00:01:30.430> right<00:01:30.670> so<00:01:30.880> this<00:01:31.060> is<00:01:31.119> the<00:01:31.390> stuff<00:01:31.600> I<00:01:31.810> used<00:01:32.140> on

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:32.770 
all right so this is the stuff I used on

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:34.740 
all right so this is the stuff I used on
these<00:01:32.950> rear<00:01:33.219> wheels<00:01:33.460> I<00:01:33.850> painted<00:01:34.570> them

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:34.750 
these rear wheels I painted them

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:39.719 
these rear wheels I painted them
completely<00:01:35.729> perhaps<00:01:36.729> in<00:01:37.000> the<00:01:37.119> future<00:01:37.299> I<00:01:38.729> will

00:01:39.719 --> 00:01:39.729 
completely perhaps in the future I will

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:42.300 
completely perhaps in the future I will
paint<00:01:40.420> them<00:01:40.600> less<00:01:40.869> just<00:01:41.649> on<00:01:41.860> the<00:01:42.039> treads

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:42.310 
paint them less just on the treads

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:46.350 
paint them less just on the treads
themselves<00:01:43.890> now<00:01:44.890> it's<00:01:45.100> a<00:01:45.189> rubber<00:01:45.429> paint<00:01:45.820> or

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:46.360 
themselves now it's a rubber paint or

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:50.940 
themselves now it's a rubber paint or
rubber<00:01:46.840> coating<00:01:49.140> as<00:01:50.140> you<00:01:50.380> can<00:01:50.500> see<00:01:50.740> it

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:50.950 
rubber coating as you can see it

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:53.010 
rubber coating as you can see it
probably<00:01:51.280> doubled<00:01:51.640> the<00:01:51.759> grip<00:01:51.939> that<00:01:52.119> he<00:01:52.210> had<00:01:52.420> it

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:53.020 
probably doubled the grip that he had it

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:55.200 
probably doubled the grip that he had it
didn't<00:01:53.350> make<00:01:53.470> it<00:01:53.679> as<00:01:53.799> grippy<00:01:54.189> as<00:01:54.399> the<00:01:54.819> original

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:55.210 
didn't make it as grippy as the original

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:59.490 
didn't make it as grippy as the original
track<00:01:55.420> master<00:01:55.899> or<00:01:56.020> Tomi's<00:01:56.909> but<00:01:58.020> very<00:01:59.020> grippy

00:01:59.490 --> 00:01:59.500 
track master or Tomi's but very grippy

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:05.160 
track master or Tomi's but very grippy
indeed<00:01:59.829> still<00:02:03.060> I've<00:02:04.060> also<00:02:04.330> gone<00:02:04.810> ahead<00:02:04.990> and

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:05.170 
indeed still I've also gone ahead and

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:11.550 
indeed still I've also gone ahead and
weighted<00:02:05.890> him<00:02:06.009> up<00:02:09.269> out<00:02:10.269> of<00:02:10.420> a<00:02:10.569> seven<00:02:11.349> gram

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:11.560 
weighted him up out of a seven gram

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:18.180 
weighted him up out of a seven gram
weight<00:02:12.090> to<00:02:13.090> each<00:02:13.360> side<00:02:15.959> and<00:02:16.959> I<00:02:17.380> did<00:02:17.799> just<00:02:17.950> snip

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.190 
weight to each side and I did just snip

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:20.130 
weight to each side and I did just snip
these<00:02:18.459> little<00:02:18.760> bits<00:02:18.940> out<00:02:19.269> of<00:02:19.480> the<00:02:19.540> shell<00:02:19.780> to<00:02:19.989> my

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.140 
these little bits out of the shell to my

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:26.080 
these little bits out of the shell to my
clothes<00:02:20.410> fit<00:02:20.829> you<00:02:21.959> can<00:02:22.959> see<00:02:23.200> where<00:02:23.380> I<00:02:23.410> did<00:02:23.680> that

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.090 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:30.350 

I'm<00:02:27.090> pretty<00:02:27.300> happy<00:02:27.510> with<00:02:27.720> that<00:02:28.880> now<00:02:29.880> for

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
I'm pretty happy with that now for

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:34.340 
I'm pretty happy with that now for
Timothy<00:02:31.730> laws<00:02:32.730> didn't<00:02:33.240> say<00:02:33.450> I<00:02:33.750> said<00:02:34.080> I<00:02:34.110> wasn't

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:34.350 
Timothy laws didn't say I said I wasn't

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:37.030 
Timothy laws didn't say I said I wasn't
going<00:02:34.620> to<00:02:34.890> I<00:02:35.190> did<00:02:35.640> because<00:02:36.060> it<00:02:36.150> was<00:02:36.210> on<00:02:36.390> sale

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:37.040 
going to I did because it was on sale

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:43.210 
going to I did because it was on sale
I'm<00:02:38.040> gonna<00:02:38.540> do<00:02:39.540> that<00:02:39.780> review<00:02:40.290> unboxing<00:02:40.860> next

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:43.220 
I'm gonna do that review unboxing next

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:45.890 
I'm gonna do that review unboxing next
for<00:02:44.220> now<00:02:44.340> I<00:02:44.400> just<00:02:44.550> wanted<00:02:44.910> to<00:02:45.030> give<00:02:45.210> you<00:02:45.300> guys<00:02:45.510> a

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
for now I just wanted to give you guys a

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:52.960 
for now I just wanted to give you guys a
quick<00:02:46.230> update<00:02:46.550> about<00:02:47.550> the<00:02:48.020> Plasti<00:02:49.020> Dip<00:02:49.070> test

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:52.970 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:57.040 

so<00:02:53.970> you<00:02:54.300> stand<00:02:54.540> quite<00:02:54.810> a<00:02:54.840> few<00:02:55.080> laps<00:02:55.260> also<00:02:55.890> I

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:57.050 
so you stand quite a few laps also I

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:59.360 
so you stand quite a few laps also I
don't<00:02:58.050> see<00:02:58.230> any<00:02:58.470> obvious<00:02:58.710> where<00:02:59.130> at<00:02:59.280> the

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
don't see any obvious where at the

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:14.360 
don't see any obvious where at the
moment

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:17.310 

so<00:03:15.370> it's<00:03:15.640> still<00:03:15.880> a<00:03:15.940> good<00:03:16.030> decent<00:03:16.540> amount<00:03:17.020> of<00:03:17.140> it

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:17.320 
so it's still a good decent amount of it

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:21.980 
so it's still a good decent amount of it
on<00:03:17.440> there<00:03:19.080> and<00:03:20.080> we<00:03:20.200> get<00:03:20.290> to<00:03:20.350> see<00:03:20.680> how<00:03:21.010> performs

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:21.990 
on there and we get to see how performs

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:27.420 
on there and we get to see how performs
overtime<00:03:23.070> if<00:03:24.070> it<00:03:24.250> all<00:03:24.370> rubs<00:03:24.640> off<00:03:24.910> and<00:03:26.430> if

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:27.430 
overtime if it all rubs off and if

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:29.910 
overtime if it all rubs off and if
multiple<00:03:28.300> coats<00:03:28.570> will<00:03:28.840> make<00:03:29.050> it<00:03:29.230> more<00:03:29.500> rubbery

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:29.920 
multiple coats will make it more rubbery

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:34.260 
multiple coats will make it more rubbery
oh<00:03:31.620> yeah<00:03:32.680> I'll<00:03:32.890> let<00:03:33.400> you<00:03:33.490> the<00:03:33.640> guys<00:03:33.820> know<00:03:34.120> in
