this<00:00:48.090> is<00:00:48.210> what<00:00:48.390> we<00:00:48.510> call<00:00:48.780> the<00:00:48.989> ribbon<00:00:49.379> stage

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:50.270 
this is what we call the ribbon stage

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:53.479 
this is what we call the ribbon stage
when<00:00:51.270> you<00:00:51.420> lift<00:00:51.719> your<00:00:51.870> beaters<00:00:52.230> up<00:00:52.469> the<00:00:53.280> batter

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
when you lift your beaters up the batter

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.630

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
kind dribbles down like ribbons so this

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.250 
kind dribbles down like ribbons so this
