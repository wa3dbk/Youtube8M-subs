that when I go outdoors I put a four
windscreen<00:01:11.520> on<00:01:11.549> it<00:01:11.880> to<00:01:12.240> wipe<00:01:13.229> out<00:01:13.439> the<00:01:13.799> wind

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
windscreen on it to wipe out the wind

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.789 
windscreen on it to wipe out the wind
noise<00:01:14.509> but<00:01:15.509> it's<00:01:15.659> a<00:01:15.720> phenomenal<00:01:16.259> microphone

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
noise but it's a phenomenal microphone

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:20.240 
noise but it's a phenomenal microphone
now<00:01:17.400> there<00:01:17.729> is<00:01:17.880> one<00:01:18.299> issue<00:01:18.840> with<00:01:19.680> the<00:01:19.830> etm001

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
now there is one issue with the etm001

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.490 
now there is one issue with the etm001
and<00:01:21.210> that's<00:01:21.420> because<00:01:21.750> it<00:01:21.869> is<00:01:21.990> a<00:01:22.020> high<00:01:22.290> gain

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
and that's because it is a high gain

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.340 
and that's because it is a high gain
microphone<00:01:23.009> when<00:01:23.460> you're<00:01:23.610> on<00:01:23.790> a<00:01:23.820> bus<00:01:24.210> in<00:01:24.750> a<00:01:24.960> car

whereas<00:01:53.460> ETM<00:01:54.000> is<00:01:54.180> omnidirectional<00:01:54.570> so<00:01:55.560> you

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
whereas ETM is omnidirectional so you

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:58.069 
whereas ETM is omnidirectional so you
need<00:01:55.920> to<00:01:56.009> have<00:01:56.159> it<00:01:56.280> on<00:01:56.369> a<00:01:56.670> cable<00:01:57.030> and<00:01:57.329> that's

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
need to have it on a cable and that's

00:01:58.079 --> 00:01:59.480 
need to have it on a cable and that's
actually<00:01:58.290> kind<00:01:58.619> of<00:01:58.740> cool<00:01:58.950> for<00:01:59.159> a<00:01:59.219> number<00:01:59.460> of

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
actually kind of cool for a number of

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.160 
actually kind of cool for a number of
reasons<00:01:59.549> so<00:01:59.969> the<00:02:00.090> way<00:02:00.180> I<00:02:00.210> actually<00:02:00.719> use<00:02:01.049> the

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
reasons so the way I actually use the

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.560 
reasons so the way I actually use the
camera<00:02:01.469> is<00:02:01.619> I<00:02:01.799> plug<00:02:02.159> it<00:02:02.280> in<00:02:02.430> to<00:02:03.060> the<00:02:03.180> side<00:02:03.420> of

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
camera is I plug it in to the side of

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.560 
camera is I plug it in to the side of
the<00:02:03.659> GoPro<00:02:03.930> hero2<00:02:04.229> and<00:02:04.740> then<00:02:05.640> I<00:02:05.729> loop<00:02:06.090> the

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
the GoPro hero2 and then I loop the

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.139 
the GoPro hero2 and then I loop the
microphone<00:02:07.110> cord<00:02:07.439> around<00:02:07.740> the<00:02:08.190> base<00:02:08.550> of<00:02:08.580> the

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
microphone cord around the base of the

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:13.280 
microphone cord around the base of the
tripod<00:02:09.750> extension<00:02:10.319> so<00:02:10.890> this<00:02:11.129> allows<00:02:11.550> me

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
tripod extension so this allows me

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.559 
tripod extension so this allows me
position<00:02:13.920> the<00:02:14.280> microphone<00:02:14.849> so<00:02:15.060> it's<00:02:15.209> facing

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:15.569 
position the microphone so it's facing

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:19.520 
position the microphone so it's facing
the<00:02:15.780> front<00:02:16.079> so<00:02:17.040> when<00:02:17.400> I<00:02:17.430> log<00:02:17.819> with<00:02:18.180> the<00:02:18.629> ETM<00:02:19.109> 0<00:02:19.349> 0

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
the front so when I log with the ETM 0 0

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.649 
the front so when I log with the ETM 0 0
8<00:02:19.680> the<00:02:20.010> microphone<00:02:20.459> is<00:02:20.640> facing<00:02:21.060> towards<00:02:21.629> the

00:02:21.649 --> 00:02:21.659 
8 the microphone is facing towards the

00:02:21.659 --> 00:02:23.119 
8 the microphone is facing towards the
front<00:02:21.750> of<00:02:22.079> me<00:02:22.170> and<00:02:22.349> I<00:02:22.409> still<00:02:22.469> get<00:02:22.799> the<00:02:22.920> great

00:02:23.119 --> 00:02:23.129 
front of me and I still get the great

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:26.599 
front of me and I still get the great
sound<00:02:23.629> if<00:02:24.629> I<00:02:24.810> point<00:02:25.019> the<00:02:25.170> camera<00:02:25.349> away<00:02:25.590> I<00:02:26.219> try

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:26.609 
sound if I point the camera away I try

00:02:26.609 --> 00:02:28.399 
sound if I point the camera away I try
to<00:02:26.670> have<00:02:26.849> my<00:02:26.879> voice<00:02:27.150> close<00:02:27.719> to<00:02:27.930> the<00:02:27.989> microphone

00:02:28.399 --> 00:02:28.409 
to have my voice close to the microphone

00:02:28.409 --> 00:02:29.860 
to have my voice close to the microphone
so<00:02:28.439> it<00:02:28.920> still<00:02:29.129> picks<00:02:29.370> it<00:02:29.519> up

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
so it still picks it up

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:33.259 
so it still picks it up
however<00:02:30.870> ideally<00:02:31.819> you<00:02:32.819> should<00:02:32.849> really<00:02:33.209> be

00:02:33.259 --> 00:02:33.269 
however ideally you should really be

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:36.170 
however ideally you should really be
using<00:02:33.390> the<00:02:34.200> cord<00:02:34.680> to<00:02:35.099> clip<00:02:35.340> the<00:02:35.459> microphone<00:02:35.489> to

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
using the cord to clip the microphone to

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.300 
using the cord to clip the microphone to
your<00:02:36.359> body<00:02:36.689> and<00:02:37.079> that's<00:02:37.530> actually<00:02:38.010> kind<00:02:38.250> of

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
your body and that's actually kind of

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.129 
your body and that's actually kind of
cool<00:02:38.519> as<00:02:38.730> well<00:02:38.939> because<00:02:39.359> if<00:02:39.599> you're<00:02:39.870> using

00:02:40.129 --> 00:02:40.139 
cool as well because if you're using

00:02:40.139 --> 00:02:42.740 
cool as well because if you're using
another<00:02:40.409> camera<00:02:41.310> you<00:02:41.700> can<00:02:41.819> actually<00:02:41.849> use<00:02:42.420> this

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
another camera you can actually use this

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:46.039 
another camera you can actually use this
as<00:02:43.049> your<00:02:43.439> lav<00:02:43.680> mic<00:02:44.040> which<00:02:44.459> is<00:02:44.760> very<00:02:45.209> helpful<00:02:45.569> in

00:02:46.039 --> 00:02:46.049 
as your lav mic which is very helpful in

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:48.589 
as your lav mic which is very helpful in
number<00:02:46.409> of<00:02:46.530> different<00:02:46.889> situations<00:02:47.069> so<00:02:47.700> these

00:02:48.589 --> 00:02:48.599 
number of different situations so these

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:51.170 
number of different situations so these
are<00:02:48.870> the<00:02:48.930> microphones<00:02:49.230> that<00:02:49.620> I<00:02:49.980> like<00:02:50.700> to<00:02:51.150> use

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
are the microphones that I like to use

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:53.890 
are the microphones that I like to use
they're<00:02:51.750> both<00:02:51.930> fairly<00:02:52.290> affordable<00:02:52.859> I<00:02:53.250> think

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:53.900 
they're both fairly affordable I think

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:56.240 
they're both fairly affordable I think
this<00:02:54.900> is<00:02:55.049> the<00:02:55.169> more<00:02:55.379> affordable<00:02:55.620> of<00:02:55.950> the<00:02:56.069> tube

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
this is the more affordable of the tube

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:00.500 
this is the more affordable of the tube
and<00:02:56.459> this<00:02:56.609> one<00:02:56.760> comes<00:02:56.970> with<00:02:57.349> the<00:02:58.970> cord<00:02:59.970> here<00:03:00.329> as

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
and this one comes with the cord here as

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:02.839 
and this one comes with the cord here as
well<00:03:00.780> to<00:03:01.680> get<00:03:01.769> information<00:03:02.040> on<00:03:02.430> these

00:03:02.839 --> 00:03:02.849 
well to get information on these

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:05.569 
well to get information on these
microphones<00:03:03.840> you<00:03:04.139> can<00:03:04.169> head<00:03:05.010> on<00:03:05.099> over<00:03:05.310> to<00:03:05.340> Chi
