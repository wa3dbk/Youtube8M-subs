how to fill up a glass flask with water
and<00:00:24.630> eventually<00:00:25.140> that<00:00:25.350> will<00:00:25.470> help<00:00:25.619> you<00:00:25.859> into

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
for this is glass flat a glass flask how

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.240 
for this is glass flat a glass flask how
you<00:00:39.989> get<00:00:40.230> a<00:00:40.260> glass<00:00:40.469> flask<00:00:40.800> they're<00:00:41.010> really

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
you get a glass flask they're really

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:42.709 
you get a glass flask they're really
really<00:00:41.430> cheap<00:00:41.670> you<00:00:41.940> can<00:00:42.120> get<00:00:42.239> them<00:00:42.360> from<00:00:42.570> the

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
really cheap you can get them from the

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
icon over here well it's kind of a small

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:58.670 
icon over here well it's kind of a small
I<00:00:57.390> cancel<00:00:57.809> don't<00:00:57.960> know<00:00:58.020> if<00:00:58.079> you<00:00:58.140> guys<00:00:58.230> can<00:00:58.469> see

be able to if you scroll up sorry you'll
be<00:01:15.600> able<00:01:15.689> the<00:01:15.960> first<00:01:16.200> thing<00:01:16.380> there<00:01:16.530> is<00:01:16.619> a<00:01:16.650> glass

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
be able the first thing there is a glass

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.340 
be able the first thing there is a glass
flask<00:01:17.159> and<00:01:17.430> it's<00:01:17.549> only<00:01:17.909> two<00:01:18.210> copper<00:01:18.570> so<00:01:18.869> that's

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
flask and it's only two copper so that's

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:20.719 
flask and it's only two copper so that's
really<00:01:19.560> easy<00:01:19.740> if<00:01:19.920> you<00:01:19.979> just<00:01:20.040> sell<00:01:20.369> a<00:01:20.400> bunch<00:01:20.580> of

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
really easy if you just sell a bunch of

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.450 
really easy if you just sell a bunch of
your<00:01:20.909> stuff<00:01:21.030> that<00:01:21.360> you<00:01:21.390> collected<00:01:22.100> maybe<00:01:23.100> here

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
your stuff that you collected maybe here

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:24.649 
your stuff that you collected maybe here
for<00:01:23.640> example<00:01:23.820> if<00:01:24.000> I<00:01:24.090> sell<00:01:24.270> this<00:01:24.420> that's

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
for example if I sell this that's

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.810 
for example if I sell this that's
already<00:01:24.840> two<00:01:25.110> copper<00:01:25.369> and<00:01:26.369> here<00:01:26.610> you<00:01:26.700> have

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820

already two copper and here you have
your<00:01:26.970> money<00:01:27.150> obviously<00:01:27.600> and<00:01:28.320> you<00:01:28.409> just<00:01:28.560> buy<00:01:28.710> a

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
your money obviously and you just buy a

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.890 
your money obviously and you just buy a
bunch<00:01:29.040> of<00:01:29.100> glass<00:01:29.369> flasks<00:01:29.939> so<00:01:30.420> here<00:01:30.689> you<00:01:30.780> can

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
bunch of glass flasks so here you can

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:35.060 
bunch of glass flasks so here you can
see<00:01:31.110> I<00:01:31.140> got<00:01:31.380> fourteen<00:01:31.890> glass<00:01:32.130> flasks<00:01:32.460> on<00:01:34.070> and

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
see I got fourteen glass flasks on and

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.130 
see I got fourteen glass flasks on and
then<00:01:35.310> once<00:01:35.729> you<00:01:35.880> have<00:01:36.000> that<00:01:36.150> you<00:01:36.479> have<00:01:36.810> to<00:01:36.960> find

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
then once you have that you have to find

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.690 
then once you have that you have to find
some<00:01:37.320> water<00:01:37.500> so<00:01:37.770> you<00:01:37.829> can<00:01:38.070> there's<00:01:38.340> plenty<00:01:38.670> of

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
some water so you can there's plenty of

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.160 
some water so you can there's plenty of
ways<00:01:39.030> you<00:01:39.210> can<00:01:39.329> find<00:01:39.570> water<00:01:39.750> you<00:01:39.900> can<00:01:40.020> just

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
ways you can find water you can just

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.289 
ways you can find water you can just
look<00:01:40.290> for<00:01:40.350> water<00:01:40.740> so<00:01:41.250> a<00:01:41.280> river<00:01:41.610> or<00:01:41.820> a<00:01:41.909> lake<00:01:41.939> or

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
look for water so a river or a lake or

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:47.389 
look for water so a river or a lake or
whatever<00:01:42.479> or<00:01:42.930> you<00:01:42.990> can<00:01:43.680> find<00:01:43.979> a<00:01:45.680> well<00:01:46.680> so<00:01:47.189> let's

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
whatever or you can find a well so let's

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:50.679 
whatever or you can find a well so let's
go<00:01:47.520> to<00:01:47.579> the<00:01:47.790> closest<00:01:48.329> water<00:01:48.600> over<00:01:48.899> here<00:01:49.170> I

00:01:50.679 --> 00:01:50.689 
go to the closest water over here I

00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:53.719 
go to the closest water over here I
think<00:01:51.689> there's<00:01:51.840> a<00:01:51.899> wall<00:01:52.079> over<00:01:52.350> this<00:01:52.470> here<00:01:52.799> the

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
think there's a wall over this here the

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.670 
think there's a wall over this here the
wells<00:01:53.939> have<00:01:54.240> like<00:01:54.450> a<00:01:54.479> little<00:01:54.930> red<00:01:55.140> roof<00:01:55.380> so

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
wells have like a little red roof so

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.520 
wells have like a little red roof so
there<00:01:55.860> should<00:01:56.009> be<00:01:56.040> red<00:01:56.909> roof<00:01:57.600> sorry<00:01:58.020> this

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
there should be red roof sorry this

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.590 
there should be red roof sorry this
should<00:01:58.590> be<00:01:58.740> pretty<00:01:58.950> easy<00:01:59.189> to<00:01:59.430> spot

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
should be pretty easy to spot

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.399 
should be pretty easy to spot
if<00:02:01.159> you're<00:02:02.159> lucky<00:02:02.310> enough<00:02:02.490> to<00:02:02.880> find<00:02:03.119> one<00:02:03.409> but

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
if you're lucky enough to find one but

if you're lucky enough to find one but
I'm<00:02:04.829> just<00:02:04.890> going<00:02:05.130> to<00:02:05.219> go<00:02:05.310> to<00:02:05.340> the

to the river let's see if I can find
find<00:02:09.700> any<00:02:09.940> wells<00:02:10.170> close<00:02:11.170> by<00:02:12.480> apparently<00:02:13.480> not

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
find any wells close by apparently not

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:17.880 
find any wells close by apparently not
let's<00:02:15.010> just<00:02:15.130> go<00:02:15.250> to<00:02:15.310> the<00:02:15.430> water<00:02:15.820> oh<00:02:16.740> there<00:02:17.740> is<00:02:17.860> a

let's just go to the water oh there is a

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:19.590 
let's just go to the water oh there is a
well<00:02:18.100> okay<00:02:18.400> there<00:02:18.640> you<00:02:18.670> go<00:02:18.790> that's<00:02:19.300> good

enough so you're gonna have to find a

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:23.160 
enough so you're gonna have to find a
well<00:02:21.790> they<00:02:22.120> look<00:02:22.330> something<00:02:22.540> like<00:02:22.690> this<00:02:22.990> or
