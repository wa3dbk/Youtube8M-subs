 What we do is very simple. 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:11.729

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:14.220
 tasty, that's ok, I love it, I 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:16.590
 I prefer the roast beef because the steak 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.810

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:22.860

 was not hidden the tip of my 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:34.110
 so come what I was looking for 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:36.420
 so one of mine is like there is a cut 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:43.860
 almost a triangle with a dot 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:45.930
 agent tempered with salt honey salt here stays 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.670
 all passionate world condition but 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:51.090
 really it 's very practical I 'm not 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:56.369
 advertising nothing but he's good 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:59.310
 we put some garlic that does not like 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:59.729
 of garlic plays outside, no problem 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.159
 none 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:05.340
 but those that one my good 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:07.439
 tempered snake're here with garlic but has 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:10.140
 many people who like right 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:15.360
 boots that come from both sides are 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:18.890
 understanding the garlic other side will bounce 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:18.890
 I'm also from the other side. 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:26.700
 It was good that I did not like it here. 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:28.050
 in that it is expensive and without faceless also does not have 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:35.640
 no thanks 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:42.989
 the ground peppercorn tap turns again and 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:48.540
 Let's go now, let's face it. 

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:51.420
 sprigs of rosemary basil and all 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:54.480
 the paths you want to put 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:57.329
 want to put on the veil I have saved is that 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:03:00.180
 I just do not boil parsley because I'm from 

00:02:57.329 --> 00:03:04.290
 club sausen it 's just for the front I do not 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:09.180
 like a belt in roland garros and ta 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:14.849
 So I put it that way and then I'll get a movie. 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:18.480
 Plastic and well-enveloped envelope mania 

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:23.310
 as in the plastic film and then this 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:27.329
 mine stays like this from day to day 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:29.400
 It's very close because it's without 

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:31.980
 closed that she will get everyone and 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:33.930
 tasty that came back hermetically 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:36.540
 closed within the movie 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:40.260
 so let's leave mine here nothing 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:42.540
 day to day is in the light fridge 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:46.919
 Do not leave outside the refrigerator while 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:48.419
 You're the account that now is not 

00:03:46.919 --> 00:03:52.470
 meanwhile now yes 

00:03:48.419 --> 00:03:56.790
 The other day, we'll do it. 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:59.819
 next we get potatoes with peel 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:03.030
 so sliced someone bacquets shoots 

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:07.169
 attacked the case that barkat one 

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:09.239
 cut for you yeah 

00:04:07.169 --> 00:04:12.030
 This has to be a good process. 

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:13.620
 fast because leaving too much time to 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:16.049
 potato is going to get dark 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:22.680
 You will put a yarn here in the potato 

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:27.240
 of olive oil opa that phil grosso is 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:29.370
 a moon and let's do it here oh well 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:32.340
 because this will prevent 

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:35.610
 Is the potato choosing this one? 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:41.660
 salty little salt because the line is 

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:45.060
 tinted in the salt and so the potatoes are 

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:48.330
 involved in salt we can also put 

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:53.210
 a little rosemary these battles to 

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:53.210
 a z-ring and do not want to vote can not 

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:59.669
 rosemary automates a lot here too 

00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:00.570
 not very well managed is a 

00:04:59.669 --> 00:05:04.470
 delicious 

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:06.120
 of course you can not put too much but 

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:10.620
 a little bit always good 

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:13.530
 The other day I put mine that was 

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:18.919
 tempered one day to the next we 

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:24.840
 will take the seasoning out and will 

00:05:18.919 --> 00:05:31.440
 square the branches all over without 

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:34.410
 No problem, there's no way to go. 

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:35.910
 this potato all we will put the 

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:39.840
 little sister 

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:43.200
 Look how raw and this dish is already beautiful. 

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:47.010
 Let's get the potatoes ready for them. 

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:48.720
 Do not be too close, it 's still there. 

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:55.849
 they leave equally 

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:59.760
 so here're're done this dish maninha 

00:05:55.849 --> 00:06:02.789
 roasted with herbs and potatoes 

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:03.419
 now it goes to the oven during a 

00:06:02.789 --> 00:06:06.750
 hour 

00:06:03.419 --> 00:06:09.360
