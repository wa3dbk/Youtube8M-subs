 he called me to inform him 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:26.409
 that had nested in the story 

00:00:26.409 --> 00:00:29.409
 between the Colombian army 

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:31.789
 and forces 

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:32.760
 of the farc 

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:35.670
 the revolutionary armed forces of colombia 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.770
 that said meeting had been found near

 and when attacked the guerrilla fled towards our territory 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:47.690
 and would 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:51.380
 continued responded with fire for which the Colombian armed force was 

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:52.810
 they have to defend 

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:56.000
 and the product of the shock was a dead Colombian soldier 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:59.690
 17 guerrillas killed the wounded 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:03.950

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:05.330
 of the farc 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:07.730
 this was already the quarry 

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:10.870
 but in a chase that ended up military and hotter up 

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:11.900
 understandable 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:13.650

 in a transaction that is understood 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:27.100
 in a hot chase 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:29.369
 applying prudence 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.470
 premieres in these cases 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:32.980
 we have waited

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:47.210
 to verify in situ 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:50.590
 although what really had concurred 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:52.150
 to surprise 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:54.280
