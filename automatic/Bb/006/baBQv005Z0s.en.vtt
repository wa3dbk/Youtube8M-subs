00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
frustrations it's hard sometimes when we

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.760 
frustrations it's hard sometimes when we
see<00:01:36.650> what<00:01:37.650> feels<00:01:38.189> to<00:01:38.490> be<00:01:38.520> true<00:01:38.970> and<00:01:39.500> so<00:01:40.500> many

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
see what feels to be true and so many

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.710 
see what feels to be true and so many
people<00:01:41.369> don't<00:01:42.180> see<00:01:42.600> that<00:01:42.630> truth<00:01:43.229> and<00:01:43.909> we<00:01:44.909> have

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
people don't see that truth and we have

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.410 
people don't see that truth and we have
a<00:01:45.750> strong<00:01:46.290> understanding<00:01:46.850> that<00:01:47.850> that<00:01:47.880> truth

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
a strong understanding that that truth

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.490 
a strong understanding that that truth
would<00:01:49.409> perhaps<00:01:50.000> help<00:01:51.000> people<00:01:51.450> suffer<00:01:51.840> less<00:01:52.049> I

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
would perhaps help people suffer less I

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.580 
would perhaps help people suffer less I
can<00:01:53.310> relate<00:01:53.640> to<00:01:53.700> that<00:01:53.880> feeling<00:01:54.290> so<00:01:55.290> I<00:01:55.320> do

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
can relate to that feeling so I do

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.219 
can relate to that feeling so I do
understand<00:01:56.399> that<00:01:56.640> but<00:01:57.600> I<00:01:57.630> thought<00:01:57.990> it<00:01:58.200> might

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
understand that but I thought it might

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:02.270 
understand that but I thought it might
be<00:01:58.860> a<00:01:58.890> good<00:01:59.009> idea<00:01:59.329> because<00:02:00.740> you<00:02:01.740> seemed<00:02:02.130> a

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:11.660 
that your mother maybe even was going to

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:15.080 
that your mother maybe even was going to
commit<00:03:12.660> suicide<00:03:12.810> at<00:03:13.590> one<00:03:13.739> point<00:03:14.040> right<00:03:14.519> and

think that when if child realizes that

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:33.289 
think that when if child realizes that
her<00:03:30.120> own<00:03:30.299> mother<00:03:30.660> was<00:03:31.590> willing<00:03:31.980> or<00:03:32.790> at<00:03:33.030> least

00:03:33.289 --> 00:03:33.299 
her own mother was willing or at least

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:40.130 
her own mother was willing or at least
to<00:03:33.510> consider<00:03:34.220> to<00:03:35.220> die<00:03:36.200> that<00:03:37.489> maybe<00:03:38.489> she<00:03:39.180> may

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:40.140 
to consider to die that maybe she may

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:43.970 
to consider to die that maybe she may
have<00:03:40.440> some<00:03:40.739> anger<00:03:41.010> about<00:03:41.609> that<00:03:42.680> that<00:03:43.680> that

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:43.980 
have some anger about that that that

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:46.849 
have some anger about that that that
someone<00:03:44.640> would<00:03:44.850> rather<00:03:45.299> choose<00:03:45.900> to<00:03:46.200> die<00:03:46.410> than

all the way back to when you were a

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:25.850 
all the way back to when you were a
little<00:04:23.400> baby<00:04:23.840> you're<00:04:24.840> a<00:04:24.900> little<00:04:25.199> baby<00:04:25.379> kid

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:25.860

00:04:30.649 --> 00:04:30.659 
to die but she didn't and that's the

00:04:30.659 --> 00:04:32.390 
to die but she didn't and that's the
important<00:04:31.139> thing<00:04:31.199> to<00:04:31.349> remember<00:04:31.500> is<00:04:32.069> that<00:04:32.099> she

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:32.400 
important thing to remember is that she

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:36.050 
important thing to remember is that she
didn't<00:04:32.970> and<00:04:33.180> she<00:04:33.599> chose<00:04:33.960> life<00:04:34.680> and<00:04:35.159> you<00:04:35.909> know

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:36.060 
didn't and she chose life and you know

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:39.050 
didn't and she chose life and you know
that<00:04:36.389> might<00:04:36.659> be<00:04:36.870> why<00:04:37.370> you<00:04:38.370> know<00:04:38.580> that<00:04:38.849> people

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:39.060 
that might be why you know that people

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:41.990 
that might be why you know that people
can<00:04:39.509> choose<00:04:39.870> life<00:04:40.229> because<00:04:41.159> you<00:04:41.340> know<00:04:41.580> that

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:42.000 
can choose life because you know that

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.330 
can choose life because you know that
your<00:04:42.120> mother<00:04:42.360> chose<00:04:42.449> life<00:04:43.080> and<00:04:43.500> her<00:04:44.099> life<00:04:44.129> was

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:44.340 
your mother chose life and her life was

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:47.450 
your mother chose life and her life was
hard<00:04:44.729> but<00:04:45.030> she<00:04:45.270> still<00:04:45.569> chose<00:04:45.930> to<00:04:46.229> to<00:04:46.830> live<00:04:47.099> and

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:47.460 
hard but she still chose to to live and

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:49.580 
hard but she still chose to to live and
she's<00:04:47.639> continuing<00:04:48.479> to<00:04:48.659> choose<00:04:49.020> and<00:04:49.379> she's

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:49.590 
she's continuing to choose and she's

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:51.999 
she's continuing to choose and she's
growing<00:04:50.250> and<00:04:50.490> she's<00:04:50.639> learning<00:04:51.270> and<00:04:51.509> she's<00:04:51.690> a

00:04:51.999 --> 00:04:52.009 
growing and she's learning and she's a

00:04:52.009 --> 00:04:55.790 
growing and she's learning and she's a
grandma<00:04:53.009> and<00:04:53.400> so<00:04:53.789> you<00:04:54.509> know<00:04:54.750> that<00:04:55.050> that<00:04:55.469> choice

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:55.800 
grandma and so you know that that choice

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:57.680 
grandma and so you know that that choice
is<00:04:55.860> out<00:04:56.310> there<00:04:56.550> for<00:04:56.729> people<00:04:56.759> so<00:04:57.360> it<00:04:57.479> makes

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:57.690 
is out there for people so it makes

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:00.529 
is out there for people so it makes
sense<00:04:57.810> then<00:04:58.199> that<00:04:58.440> you<00:04:59.129> would<00:04:59.310> want<00:04:59.490> to<00:05:00.300> share

00:05:00.529 --> 00:05:00.539 
sense then that you would want to share

00:05:00.539 --> 00:05:04.760 
sense then that you would want to share
that<00:05:01.129> that's<00:05:02.129> very<00:05:02.400> nice<00:05:02.669> but<00:05:03.169> you<00:05:04.169> might<00:05:04.500> want

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:04.770 
that that's very nice but you might want

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:07.520 
that that's very nice but you might want
to<00:05:04.860> think<00:05:05.009> about<00:05:05.219> the<00:05:05.520> fact<00:05:05.729> that<00:05:05.969> your<00:05:06.960> anger

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:07.530 
to think about the fact that your anger

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:11.300 
to think about the fact that your anger
might<00:05:07.740> scare<00:05:08.219> some<00:05:08.250> people<00:05:08.490> away<00:05:09.150> I<00:05:10.310> checked

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:11.310 
might scare some people away I checked

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:14.300 
might scare some people away I checked
our<00:05:11.520> subscriber<00:05:12.120> list<00:05:12.599> and<00:05:13.080> it<00:05:13.919> looks<00:05:14.190> like

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:14.310 
our subscriber list and it looks like

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:17.740 
our subscriber list and it looks like
you've<00:05:14.699> both<00:05:15.120> lost<00:05:15.479> a<00:05:16.110> few<00:05:16.319> subscribers<00:05:16.590> and

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:17.750 
you've both lost a few subscribers and

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:21.080 
you've both lost a few subscribers and
you've<00:05:18.750> gained<00:05:19.020> some<00:05:19.469> so<00:05:20.099> I<00:05:20.460> guess<00:05:20.639> there's<00:05:21.030> a

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:21.090 
you've gained some so I guess there's a

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:23.300 
you've gained some so I guess there's a
balancing<00:05:21.810> out<00:05:22.020> that's<00:05:22.319> taking<00:05:22.830> place<00:05:22.860> right

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:23.310 
balancing out that's taking place right

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:27.350 
balancing out that's taking place right
