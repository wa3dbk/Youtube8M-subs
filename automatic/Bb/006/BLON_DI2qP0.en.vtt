I want to show you a recipe using quick
flaky<00:00:02.490> pastry<00:00:03.000> and<00:00:03.179> this<00:00:03.750> is<00:00:03.899> called<00:00:04.200> I've

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:08.760 
and they're little discs of pastry very

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.570 
and they're little discs of pastry very
very<00:00:09.090> thin<00:00:09.450> that<00:00:10.320> can<00:00:10.500> have<00:00:10.710> any<00:00:11.010> number<00:00:11.550> of

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580

very thin that can have any number of
interesting<00:00:12.059> fillings<00:00:12.630> put<00:00:12.870> on<00:00:12.990> the<00:00:13.110> top<00:00:13.349> and

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.559 
interesting fillings put on the top and

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:16.340 
interesting fillings put on the top and
the<00:00:14.490> way<00:00:14.610> you<00:00:14.670> make<00:00:14.969> them<00:00:15.210> is<00:00:15.420> to<00:00:15.809> roll<00:00:16.080> it<00:00:16.230> out

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
the way you make them is to roll it out

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.220 
the way you make them is to roll it out
very<00:00:16.650> very<00:00:16.920> thinly<00:00:17.130> like<00:00:17.520> this<00:00:17.760> and<00:00:18.060> then<00:00:18.840> they

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
very very thinly like this and then they

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.290 
very very thinly like this and then they
need<00:00:19.350> to<00:00:19.410> be<00:00:19.590> about<00:00:19.770> six<00:00:20.340> inches<00:00:20.880> in<00:00:21.060> diameter

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
need to be about six inches in diameter

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.630 
need to be about six inches in diameter
so<00:00:21.810> I've<00:00:21.900> got<00:00:22.050> a<00:00:22.080> plate<00:00:22.439> that<00:00:22.800> is<00:00:22.949> exactly<00:00:23.460> that

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
so I've got a plate that is exactly that

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.490 
so I've got a plate that is exactly that
size<00:00:23.939> don't<00:00:24.240> worry<00:00:24.449> if<00:00:24.600> it<00:00:24.779> if<00:00:25.080> it's<00:00:25.260> a<00:00:25.350> bit

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
size don't worry if it if it's a bit

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.460 
size don't worry if it if it's a bit
more<00:00:25.769> a<00:00:25.800> bit<00:00:26.039> less<00:00:26.570> and<00:00:27.570> then<00:00:27.750> what<00:00:27.900> you<00:00:28.050> do<00:00:28.230> is

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
more a bit less and then what you do is

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.830 
more a bit less and then what you do is
you<00:00:28.710> cut<00:00:29.160> round<00:00:30.090> the<00:00:31.050> plate<00:00:31.289> like<00:00:31.800> that<00:00:32.040> and

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:32.840 
you cut round the plate like that and

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:37.430 
you cut round the plate like that and
this<00:00:33.840> recipe<00:00:34.260> will<00:00:35.190> actually<00:00:35.610> make<00:00:36.260> six<00:00:37.260> of

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
this recipe will actually make six of

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:43.970 
this recipe will actually make six of
these<00:00:38.780> altogether<00:00:40.399> six<00:00:41.399> like<00:00:41.700> that<00:00:41.910> and<00:00:42.980> then

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
these altogether six like that and then

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.860 
these altogether six like that and then
I'm<00:00:44.129> going<00:00:44.309> to<00:00:44.370> put<00:00:44.610> them<00:00:44.789> onto<00:00:45.030> a<00:00:45.480> baking

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
I'm going to put them onto a baking

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.590 
I'm going to put them onto a baking
sheet<00:00:46.410> and<00:00:46.710> I'm<00:00:47.340> going<00:00:47.489> to<00:00:47.550> cut<00:00:47.760> one<00:00:47.789> more<00:00:48.120> out

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
sheet and I'm going to cut one more out

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.110 
sheet and I'm going to cut one more out
now<00:00:50.809> and<00:00:51.809> what<00:00:51.930> I<00:00:51.960> like<00:00:52.170> to<00:00:52.199> do<00:00:52.379> with<00:00:52.500> these<00:00:52.649> is

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
the oven

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:14.430 
the oven
this<00:02:13.150> one<00:02:13.420> I'm<00:02:13.630> going<00:02:13.840> to<00:02:13.900> start<00:02:14.200> off<00:02:14.410> with

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440 
this one I'm going to start off with

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:16.950 
this one I'm going to start off with
basil<00:02:15.130> leaves<00:02:15.510> and<00:02:16.510> they're<00:02:16.630> going<00:02:16.750> to<00:02:16.840> be

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:16.960 
basil leaves and they're going to be

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:19.980 
basil leaves and they're going to be
just<00:02:17.230> arranged<00:02:17.770> on<00:02:17.980> top<00:02:18.220> of<00:02:18.460> the<00:02:19.270> pastry<00:02:19.480> like

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:19.990 
just arranged on top of the pastry like

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:25.440 
just arranged on top of the pastry like
that<00:02:20.230> and<00:02:21.990> then<00:02:22.990> on<00:02:23.200> top<00:02:23.440> of<00:02:23.620> the<00:02:23.740> basil<00:02:24.450> I'm

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.450 
that and then on top of the basil I'm

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:28.260 
that and then on top of the basil I'm
going<00:02:25.750> to<00:02:25.840> put<00:02:25.930> tomatoes<00:02:26.410> and<00:02:26.880> if<00:02:27.880> the<00:02:28.030> first

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:28.270 
going to put tomatoes and if the first

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:30.810 
going to put tomatoes and if the first
one<00:02:28.570> has<00:02:29.410> a<00:02:29.440> Greek<00:02:29.740> influence<00:02:30.310> I<00:02:30.460> think<00:02:30.490> this

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:30.820 
one has a Greek influence I think this

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:35.340 
one has a Greek influence I think this
one<00:02:31.060> is<00:02:31.090> more<00:02:31.770> Provencal<00:02:33.600> because<00:02:34.600> after<00:02:35.230> the

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:35.350 
one is more Provencal because after the

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:38.100 
one is more Provencal because after the
tomatoes<00:02:35.500> have<00:02:35.890> gone<00:02:36.370> on<00:02:36.540> the<00:02:37.540> next<00:02:37.900> thing

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.110 
tomatoes have gone on the next thing

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:40.530 
tomatoes have gone on the next thing
that's<00:02:38.230> going<00:02:38.350> to<00:02:38.560> go<00:02:38.710> on<00:02:38.890> is<00:02:39.330> some<00:02:40.330> goats

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:40.540 
that's going to go on is some goats

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:43.860 
that's going to go on is some goats

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:35.390 

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:39.320

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:39.330 
so there we have savoury galets

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:42.170 
so there we have savoury galets
and<00:03:39.540> i'm<00:03:39.660> just<00:03:39.810> going<00:03:40.050> to<00:03:40.140> transfer<00:03:41.100> a<00:03:41.730> couple

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:42.180 
and i'm just going to transfer a couple

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:45.200 
and i'm just going to transfer a couple
over<00:03:42.390> to<00:03:42.690> the<00:03:42.810> plate<00:03:43.080> here<00:03:43.560> because<00:03:44.430> the

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:45.210 
over to the plate here because the

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:48.800 
over to the plate here because the
spinach<00:03:45.660> version<00:03:46.290> I<00:03:46.470> think<00:03:46.980> is<00:03:47.130> nice<00:03:47.460> if<00:03:48.450> it's

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:48.810 
spinach version I think is nice if it's

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:51.860 
spinach version I think is nice if it's
served<00:03:49.350> just<00:03:50.220> sprinkled<00:03:51.030> with<00:03:51.270> a<00:03:51.570> little

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:51.870 
served just sprinkled with a little

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:54.410 
served just sprinkled with a little
Parmesan<00:03:52.560> cheese<00:03:53.040> as<00:03:53.400> it<00:03:53.610> goes<00:03:53.760> to<00:03:53.940> the<00:03:54.030> table

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:54.420 
Parmesan cheese as it goes to the table

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:56.690 
Parmesan cheese as it goes to the table
so<00:03:54.540> that<00:03:54.570> would<00:03:54.780> be<00:03:54.900> a<00:03:54.930> very<00:03:55.230> lovely<00:03:55.950> light

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:56.700 
so that would be a very lovely light

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:07.290 
so that would be a very lovely light
lunch<00:03:57.650> served<00:03:58.650> perhaps<00:03:59.040> with<00:03:59.400> the<00:03:59.490> salad

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:07.300
