here's the Windows Firewall little brick

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:11.839 
here's the Windows Firewall little brick
wall<00:00:09.660> in<00:00:09.780> front<00:00:09.960> of<00:00:10.019> the<00:00:10.110> earth<00:00:10.550> I'll<00:00:11.550> pull

wall in front of the earth I'll pull
that<00:00:11.880> down<00:00:12.300> so<00:00:12.540> you<00:00:12.599> can<00:00:12.780> see<00:00:12.960> it<00:00:13.080> well<00:00:13.860> there's

three tabs on the general tab you want

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:19.070 
three tabs on the general tab you want
to<00:00:15.900> make<00:00:16.020> sure<00:00:16.260> that<00:00:16.619> the<00:00:16.949> firewall<00:00:17.400> is<00:00:17.580> on<00:00:18.080> the

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
only time you turn this off is if you're

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.670 
only time you turn this off is if you're

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
using some other firewall software but

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.500 
using some other firewall software but
you<00:00:22.710> absolutely<00:00:23.279> should<00:00:23.580> be<00:00:23.730> using<00:00:23.910> firewall

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
you absolutely should be using firewall

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:25.820 
you absolutely should be using firewall
software<00:00:24.720> if<00:00:25.109> you're<00:00:25.260> gonna<00:00:25.380> be<00:00:25.560> on<00:00:25.590> the

networks like in airports and the
exceptions<00:00:43.050> tab<00:00:43.320> are<00:00:43.590> exceptions<00:00:44.309> that<00:00:44.430> are

allowed to cross the firewall like FTP

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.260 
allowed to cross the firewall like FTP

Remote Desktop Skype Yahoo Messenger and

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.000 
Remote Desktop Skype Yahoo Messenger and
so<00:00:56.699> on<00:00:56.879> you<00:00:57.600> can<00:00:57.780> add<00:00:58.020> a<00:00:58.079> program<00:00:58.649> by<00:00:58.949> clicking

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
so on you can add a program by clicking

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.280 
so on you can add a program by clicking
add<00:00:59.600> it'll<00:01:00.600> bring<00:01:00.719> up<00:01:00.870> a<00:01:00.960> list<00:01:01.199> of<00:01:01.500> programs

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:03.290 
add it'll bring up a list of programs

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:06.950 
add it'll bring up a list of programs
you<00:01:04.290> can<00:01:04.439> select<00:01:04.619> that<00:01:04.979> and<00:01:05.159> continue<00:01:05.930> you<00:01:06.930> can

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
you can select that and continue you can

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.520 
you can select that and continue you can
add<00:01:07.439> a<00:01:07.500> port<00:01:08.100> so<00:01:08.970> for<00:01:09.180> example<00:01:09.659> you<00:01:10.320> have<00:01:10.500> a

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
add a port so for example you have a

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.300 
add a port so for example you have a
program<00:01:10.830> that<00:01:11.430> says<00:01:12.350> it<00:01:13.350> needs<00:01:13.560> to<00:01:13.799> use<00:01:13.950> port

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
program that says it needs to use port

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.510 
program that says it needs to use port
521<00:01:15.180> well<00:01:15.390> you<00:01:15.479> can<00:01:15.630> go<00:01:15.780> in<00:01:15.930> here<00:01:16.320> give<00:01:17.310> it<00:01:17.460> a

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
521 well you can go in here give it a

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:23.170 
521 well you can go in here give it a
name<00:01:17.780> put<00:01:18.780> in<00:01:18.930> I<00:01:19.229> will<00:01:19.740> say<00:01:19.860> 522<00:01:20.640> port<00:01:21.630> 520<00:01:22.229> to

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:23.180 
name put in I will say 522 port 520 to

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:25.969 
name put in I will say 522 port 520 to
decide<00:01:24.180> whether<00:01:24.360> it's<00:01:24.540> TCP<00:01:25.110> or<00:01:25.259> UDP<00:01:25.290> and<00:01:25.860> I'll

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
decide whether it's TCP or UDP and I'll

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:27.789 
decide whether it's TCP or UDP and I'll
talk<00:01:26.189> about<00:01:26.220> those<00:01:26.640> in<00:01:26.880> another<00:01:26.909> tutorial

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:27.799 
talk about those in another tutorial

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:31.609 
talk about those in another tutorial
click<00:01:28.799> ok<00:01:29.220> so<00:01:30.150> now<00:01:30.270> we've<00:01:30.420> added<00:01:30.630> that<00:01:30.930> one<00:01:31.110> you

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
click ok so now we've added that one you

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.399 
click ok so now we've added that one you
can<00:01:31.799> edit<00:01:32.180> the<00:01:33.180> listings<00:01:33.630> in<00:01:33.810> here<00:01:34.079> I<00:01:34.229> don't

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
can edit the listings in here I don't

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:38.569 
can edit the listings in here I don't
suggest<00:01:34.829> it<00:01:35.390> but<00:01:36.390> changing<00:01:36.900> the<00:01:36.930> scope<00:01:37.579> talks

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
suggest it but changing the scope talks

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.520 
suggest it but changing the scope talks
about<00:01:38.880> the<00:01:39.000> different<00:01:39.329> ports<00:01:39.869> and<00:01:40.079> so<00:01:40.200> on<00:01:40.350> you

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
about the different ports and so on you

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:41.870 
about the different ports and so on you
don't<00:01:40.560> want<00:01:40.860> to<00:01:40.950> really<00:01:41.130> fiddle<00:01:41.579> around<00:01:41.729> with

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
don't want to really fiddle around with

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.639 
don't want to really fiddle around with
those<00:01:42.090> most<00:01:42.360> programs<00:01:42.899> that<00:01:43.200> are<00:01:43.320> going<00:01:43.500> to

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
those most programs that are going to

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:47.600 
those most programs that are going to
use<00:01:44.100> and<00:01:44.460> go<00:01:45.060> through<00:01:45.360> the<00:01:45.450> firewall<00:01:46.490> have<00:01:47.490> the

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
use and go through the firewall have the

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.190 
use and go through the firewall have the
ports<00:01:47.909> specifically<00:01:48.509> configured<00:01:48.869> because

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
ports specifically configured because

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.609 
ports specifically configured because
it's<00:01:49.530> an<00:01:49.680> exact<00:01:50.070> number<00:01:51.200> it<00:01:52.200> isn't<00:01:52.470> something

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
it's an exact number it isn't something

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:55.069 
it's an exact number it isn't something
you<00:01:52.829> just<00:01:53.040> guess<00:01:53.310> at<00:01:53.579> and<00:01:53.820> then<00:01:54.420> if<00:01:54.689> you<00:01:54.899> want

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
you just guess at and then if you want

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:56.929 
you just guess at and then if you want
to<00:01:55.170> get<00:01:55.290> rid<00:01:55.439> of<00:01:55.470> a<00:01:55.860> listing<00:01:56.460> that's<00:01:56.490> in<00:01:56.759> there

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
to get rid of a listing that's in there

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:58.550 
to get rid of a listing that's in there
you<00:01:57.090> can<00:01:57.240> just<00:01:57.390> highlight<00:01:57.600> it<00:01:57.899> and<00:01:58.380> click

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
you can just highlight it and click

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.280 
you can just highlight it and click
delete<00:01:59.119> you'll<00:02:00.119> find<00:02:00.390> that<00:02:00.479> some<00:02:00.540> listings<00:02:01.049> in

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
delete you'll find that some listings in

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.289 
delete you'll find that some listings in
there<00:02:01.500> are<00:02:01.649> protected<00:02:02.219> and<00:02:02.369> can't<00:02:02.700> be<00:02:02.850> deleted
