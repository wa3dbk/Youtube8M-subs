 this time I meet the 

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:21.369
 recognized pediatrician neonatologist enrique 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:22.900
 ruiz dÃ­az like this total doctor a lot 

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:24.939
 I'm glad to be with you today I'm glad 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:27.820
 much that is here with us that 

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:30.790
 must be able to make a physical child and 

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:32.950
 mentally in some moments a month 

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:35.800
 of born at three months to say it 

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:39.579
 the mayos all right one always 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:41.920
 try to create flags or goals about the 

00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:44.020
 what to get if you know what the 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:45.880
 way to go and what is your goal the 

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:48.579
 you have to get there you will not miss 

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:51.220
 the way and usually the child should 

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:53.890
 be able to smile the first month 

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:56.410
 when your dad your mom or your nanny or the 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:59.260
 person who is very close to you speaks to you 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:02.440
 our same smile with the mobile of the 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:06.220
 cradle not only smile with the face 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:08.680
 human known that is a goal a milestone 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:11.320
 important the first kiss 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:13.780
 it is normal for the child to smile with other things 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:16.210
 but important our humans and already 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:16.930
 at the end of the first month and a half two 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:19.630
 months 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:21.990
 must be able to not only smile they should 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:24.820
 be able to emit sound 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:27.010
 what does not call a babble when a 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:29.229
 person of your liking and face known 

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:32.229
 he looks at it for that reason we always say mom 

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:34.150
 paint your mouth red every time you 

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:37.510
 speak to your baby so that when you 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:38.860
 gesticulate with the ileana community the 

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:40.420
 baby knows that's the way 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:43.210
 communication that you have are asking 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:46.030
 if at two months your baby can 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:47.619
 evaluate you get rid of fear 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:49.210
 that can probably cause you 

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:51.850
 think that you may have disorder of the 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:53.500
 development like infantile autism that 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:55.780
 it has always existed but it has not 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:57.640
 discovered until very late when the 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:00.729
 child did not respond to anything in the middle 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:03.520
 environment already for the three months should 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:06.940
 as a main interest to be able to turn around 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:09.640
 upside down to face up as a goal 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:11.739
 motorboat and I forgot that the two 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:12.810
 months as a motor goal should be able 

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:14.790
 lift them 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:17.910
 of a firm surface like doing 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:19.470
 many lizards and you must do it 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:22.890
 easily to both and three 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:24.930
 turn around after four months and once 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:27.720
 You are known and if you turn helps you 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:30.450
 sit and look very straight at the baby 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:32.940
 true and can already smile not only 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:35.940
 does not give light but emits sounds 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:38.160
 they see laughter and after five months 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:40.200
 very firm with his hands from the knee to 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:42.540
 sit down and watch the program of course 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:44.430
 if he took out one hand he fell down and at six 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:47.519
 months you can take your hands and grab 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:51.239
 things and not to fall and you're already able to say 

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:53.850
 is my mom if the most repetitive 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:56.340
 mom not necessarily because I want her 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:57.569
 mom but because a syllable that can 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:59.370
 say but first you will say dad 

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:02.250
 because it 's easier not because I want it 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:04.650
 rather then already about 108 months 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:06.239
 the one able to sit and grab everything with 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:08.370
 hands and take to the mouth without 

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:11.130
 jail from the sides and start the 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:14.100
 rocking chair to try to crawl 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:16.290
 until nine months when he should crawl 

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:18.870
 if the same of the neighbor changed to the 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:20.310
 six months I congratulate you but you do not have 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:23.190
 to be distressed at nine months 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:25.890
 yet it is just beginning and 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:28.770
 two months like I told you before you get your 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:32.100
 graduation diploma when I walk 12 

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:33.510
 months walking a few days before are 

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:36.480
 a few days later they are variations 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:39.870
 normal at 15 months or from 9 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:42.840
 but well papers 12 months or so 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:45.720
 start walking in walking gives you his 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:47.540
 autonomy I do not need you also your 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:48.720
 character and the child becomes totally 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:50.850
 dependent 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:52.890
 I like only I brush my teeth only 

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:55.500
 and you do not send me because she is 

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:58.590
 a self-sufficient person with respect 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:04:01.740
 to talk like that month or because 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:02.890
 they are mom mom dad but 

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:04.720
 then 

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:07.390
 it will always depend if the parents 

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:09.640
 they handle only one single language 

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:12.130
 tongue the baby should start talking a 

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:13.870
 little faster than babies whose 

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:15.730
 dads by different nationalities 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:18.040
 they handle two languages 

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:19.660
 sometimes you live in a Hispanic country and 

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:23.020
 you have a nanny who handles another language 

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:24.669
 or change the dad to an English guy does not give 

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:26.169
 he wins learn Spanish wins her 

00:04:24.669 --> 00:04:28.570
 speaks in Spanish the mother speaks to him in 

00:04:26.169 --> 00:04:31.180
 Chinese and there is a little bit of delay in 

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:35.710
 development but by legal rule it is said 

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:39.370
 that at 24 months they should say 24 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:41.740
 words words are included wow wow 

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:44.980
 what the dog has bundled me that is cat 

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:46.840
 montÃ©s carrÃ³n soccer goal but those 

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:50.169
 words onomatopoeia of sounds 

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:52.180
 known 24 to 24 months but if you 

00:04:50.169 --> 00:04:54.220
 you realize that at 18 months it does not say 

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:56.770
 none is very difficult that in six 

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:58.600
 months mom grab or 24 then when 

00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:01.710
 a year and a half your destiny there is a 

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:01.710
 clear language 

00:05:03.639 --> 00:05:11.060
 at 18 months and a half years have not been able 

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:12.880
 clarify your language clear language 

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:14.660
 then there is a language disorder 

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:18.169
 generally more frequent in 

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:20.419
 males and even more so if your male father had 

00:05:18.169 --> 00:05:22.340
 language delay is more late 

00:05:20.419 --> 00:05:24.560
 came at the end to the filling lady 

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:25.940
 three years the kindness of but that's not 

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:29.460
 normal that you have to treat it in time 

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:32.090
 because it may not be so come 

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:32.090
 and
