00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.090 
how we come up with this idea and back

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:10.490 
how we come up with this idea and back
in<00:00:09.300> January<00:00:09.719> we<00:00:09.900> were<00:00:09.960> sitting<00:00:10.139> around<00:00:10.290> a

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:10.500 
in January we were sitting around a

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.680 
in January we were sitting around a
kitchen<00:00:10.590> table<00:00:10.889> and<00:00:11.490> one<00:00:12.059> of<00:00:12.150> the<00:00:12.210> fellows<00:00:12.540> had

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
kitchen table and one of the fellows had

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:14.509 
kitchen table and one of the fellows had
an<00:00:12.809> idea<00:00:12.960> because<00:00:13.500> we<00:00:13.920> had<00:00:14.040> seen<00:00:14.219> this<00:00:14.340> on

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
an idea because we had seen this on

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:16.820 
an idea because we had seen this on
youtube<00:00:14.700> of<00:00:15.089> these<00:00:15.839> combines<00:00:16.289> going<00:00:16.560> out<00:00:16.680> and

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
youtube of these combines going out and

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.640 
youtube of these combines going out and
combining<00:00:17.160> 160<00:00:17.910> acres<00:00:18.240> and<00:00:19.170> he<00:00:19.289> had<00:00:19.410> a<00:00:19.439> great

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
combining 160 acres and he had a great

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.320 
combining 160 acres and he had a great
idea<00:00:19.800> that<00:00:20.130> we<00:00:20.250> would<00:00:20.369> be<00:00:20.520> able<00:00:20.580> to<00:00:20.730> do<00:00:20.850> this<00:00:21.060> I

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
idea that we would be able to do this I

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.420 
idea that we would be able to do this I
wanted<00:00:21.869> to<00:00:21.930> have<00:00:22.590> the<00:00:22.710> money<00:00:22.890> go<00:00:23.070> to<00:00:23.130> a<00:00:23.220> good

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
wanted to have the money go to a good

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.340 
wanted to have the money go to a good
cause<00:00:23.670> so<00:00:24.300> we<00:00:24.449> picked<00:00:24.750> the<00:00:24.840> Canadian<00:00:25.170> food

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
cause so we picked the Canadian food

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:26.599 
cause so we picked the Canadian food
grains<00:00:25.590> bank<00:00:25.859> and<00:00:26.039> the<00:00:26.099> wonderful<00:00:26.340> work<00:00:26.580> that

grains bank and the wonderful work that
they<00:00:26.849> do<00:00:26.960> the<00:00:27.960> idea<00:00:28.199> seems<00:00:28.500> simple<00:00:28.830> enough<00:00:28.859> at

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
they do the idea seems simple enough at

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.740 
they do the idea seems simple enough at
the<00:00:29.250> time<00:00:29.279> we<00:00:29.640> are<00:00:29.670> going<00:00:29.789> to<00:00:29.939> get<00:00:30.060> 50<00:00:30.330> combines

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
the time we are going to get 50 combines

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.240 
the time we are going to get 50 combines
together<00:00:30.990> harvest<00:00:31.529> the<00:00:31.590> crop<00:00:31.800> and<00:00:32.009> sell<00:00:32.160> the

beans and by the end of that first
meeting<00:00:33.960> we<00:00:34.230> had<00:00:34.500> bigger<00:00:35.040> visions<00:00:35.460> we<00:00:35.610> thought

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
meeting we had bigger visions we thought

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:36.740 
meeting we had bigger visions we thought
well<00:00:35.969> we<00:00:36.000> could<00:00:36.210> probably<00:00:36.300> get<00:00:36.540> a<00:00:36.570> hundred

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
well we could probably get a hundred

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.920 
well we could probably get a hundred
combines<00:00:37.370> and<00:00:38.370> it's<00:00:38.489> been<00:00:38.670> a<00:00:38.700> really<00:00:39.390> exciting

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
combines and it's been a really exciting

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.360 
combines and it's been a really exciting
journey<00:00:40.110> to<00:00:40.320> get<00:00:40.469> from<00:00:40.620> that<00:00:40.739> points<00:00:41.100> where<00:00:41.250> we

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
journey to get from that points where we

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:42.560 
journey to get from that points where we
are<00:00:41.489> today<00:00:41.640> where<00:00:41.940> we<00:00:41.969> have<00:00:42.239> I<00:00:42.480> believe

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
are today where we have I believe

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.860 
are today where we have I believe
there's<00:00:43.140> over<00:00:43.379> 120<00:00:44.040> combines<00:00:44.550> and<00:00:44.879> we<00:00:45.539> didn't

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
there's over 120 combines and we didn't

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.990 
there's over 120 combines and we didn't
imagine<00:00:46.710> quite<00:00:46.860> this<00:00:47.070> many<00:00:47.309> people<00:00:47.489> coming

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
imagine quite this many people coming

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.389 
imagine quite this many people coming
and<00:00:48.090> this<00:00:48.210> is<00:00:48.360> true<00:00:48.510> we're<00:00:48.870> just<00:00:49.170> a<00:00:49.399> possible

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
and this is true we're just a possible

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:51.889 
and this is true we're just a possible
minute<00:00:50.550> and<00:00:50.760> a<00:00:50.789> half<00:00:50.820> into<00:00:51.270> this<00:00:51.390> so<00:00:51.600> here<00:00:51.780> they

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
minute and a half into this so here they
