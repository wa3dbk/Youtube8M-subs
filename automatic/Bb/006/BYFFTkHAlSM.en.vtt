so<00:02:35.800> I'm<00:02:36.800> going<00:02:36.950> to<00:02:37.040> write<00:02:37.160> the<00:02:37.310> number<00:02:39.580> so<00:02:40.580> it

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:40.730 
so I'm going to write the number so it

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:43.300 
so I'm going to write the number so it
is<00:02:41.000> both<00:02:41.390> sim<00:02:41.690> card<00:02:41.960> sim<00:02:42.260> one<00:02:42.530> two<00:02:42.830> SIM<00:02:43.040> card

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:43.310 
is both sim card sim one two SIM card

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:46.870 
is both sim card sim one two SIM card
two<00:02:43.520> SIM<00:02:44.360> card<00:02:44.660> to<00:02:44.870> two<00:02:45.110> SIM<00:02:45.320> card<00:02:45.560> one<00:02:45.800> so<00:02:46.790> you

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:46.880 
two SIM card to two SIM card one so you

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:50.890 
two SIM card to two SIM card one so you
can<00:02:47.230> select<00:02:48.230> both<00:02:48.590> sim<00:02:48.920> card<00:02:49.190> so<00:02:49.970> that<00:02:50.180> the

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:50.900 
can select both sim card so that the

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:52.660 
can select both sim card so that the
calls<00:02:51.140> would<00:02:51.350> come<00:02:51.650> to<00:02:51.920> eat<00:02:52.100> up<00:02:52.280> the<00:02:52.430> SIM<00:02:52.640> card

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:52.670 
calls would come to eat up the SIM card

00:02:52.670 --> 00:03:03.500 
calls would come to eat up the SIM card

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:15.220 
then you have a SIM card manager that

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:48.110 

let's<00:04:42.870> check<00:04:43.319> out<00:04:43.530> if<00:04:43.710> it's<00:04:46.669> it's<00:04:47.669> not<00:04:47.759> enabled

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:48.120 
let's check out if it's it's not enabled

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:51.290 
let's check out if it's it's not enabled
yet<00:04:48.600> because<00:04:49.139> I<00:04:49.169> left<00:04:49.650> the<00:04:50.460> earlier<00:04:50.819> set<00:04:51.030> up<00:04:51.180> in

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:51.300 
yet because I left the earlier set up in

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:58.400 
yet because I left the earlier set up in
between<00:04:53.780> so<00:04:54.780> now<00:04:54.960> you'll<00:04:55.199> see<00:04:56.990> the<00:04:57.990> incoming

going<00:05:50.900> to<00:05:50.990> show<00:05:51.200> you<00:05:51.230> how<00:05:51.620> this<00:05:51.920> model<00:05:52.490> sim

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:52.880 
going to show you how this model sim

00:05:52.880 --> 00:06:01.950 
going to show you how this model sim
feature<00:05:53.270> works<00:05:54.430> so<00:05:55.430> let<00:05:59.230> let's<00:06:00.230> deactivate<00:06:00.620> it

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:01.960 
feature works so let let's deactivate it

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:07.600 
feature works so let let's deactivate it
now<00:06:02.960> come<00:06:03.260> call<00:06:03.710> on<00:06:03.860> scene<00:06:04.190> to<00:06:04.550> and<00:06:06.310> the<00:06:07.310> phone

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:07.610 
now come call on scene to and the phone

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:09.730 
now come call on scene to and the phone
should<00:06:08.030> the<00:06:08.630> call<00:06:08.870> should<00:06:09.110> be<00:06:09.170> diverted<00:06:09.710> to

00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:09.740 
should the call should be diverted to

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:13.390 
should the call should be diverted to
same<00:06:10.070> one<00:06:10.340> instead<00:06:11.590> so<00:06:12.590> I'm<00:06:12.680> going<00:06:12.890> to<00:06:12.950> call<00:06:13.220> on

same one instead so I'm going to call on

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:30.810 
same one instead so I'm going to call on
sim<00:06:13.790> to

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:30.820 

00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:35.140 

it<00:06:31.820> still<00:06:32.120> calls<00:06:32.420> our<00:06:33.670> because<00:06:34.670> the<00:06:34.820> college

00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:35.150 
it still calls our because the college

00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:42.560 
devoted to scene 1 no same thing if I go

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:51.910 
devoted to scene 1 no same thing if I go
ahead<00:06:42.710> and<00:06:47.680> do<00:06:48.680> they<00:06:48.860> deactivate<00:06:49.580> sim1<00:06:50.740> on<00:06:51.740> if

ahead and do they deactivate sim1 on if

00:06:51.920 --> 00:07:10.120 
ahead and do they deactivate sim1 on if
I<00:06:52.070> call<00:06:52.370> on<00:06:52.550> same<00:06:52.940> one
