good<00:01:37.380> old<00:01:37.590> days<00:01:37.680> I<00:01:38.189> reckon<00:01:38.610> if<00:01:38.700> we<00:01:38.790> polled

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
good old days I reckon if we polled

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.219 
good old days I reckon if we polled
people<00:01:39.360> as<00:01:39.630> to<00:01:39.720> whether<00:01:39.869> they<00:01:40.020> thought

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
people as to whether they thought

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.350 
people as to whether they thought
Britain<00:01:40.680> had<00:01:40.829> got<00:01:40.950> more<00:01:41.220> or<00:01:41.400> less<00:01:41.610> creamy<00:01:42.000> over

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
the last 50 years

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.050 
the last 50 years
they'd<00:01:43.530> say<00:01:43.740> less<00:01:44.040> and<00:01:44.399> they'd<00:01:44.700> be<00:01:44.820> sorry

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
they'd say less and they'd be sorry

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
as being creamy and make that sound like

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:54.469 
as being creamy and make that sound like
a<00:01:53.670> good<00:01:53.970> thing

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479
