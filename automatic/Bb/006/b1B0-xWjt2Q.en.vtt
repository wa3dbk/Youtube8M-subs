 of my five favorite characters from 

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:19.130
 several categories I have to say that I have 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:21.110
 done a little bit of cheating because they are not 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:23.090
 my favorite favorites but as I have 

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:24.680
 many favorites I have chosen perhaps the 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:26.750
 that I like the most so well 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:28.610

 and that then well you know there are 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.840
 variety I start my favorite character 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:37.190
 of a book is magnus 20 the saga of 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:39.260
 Shadowhunters by Cassandra Clare 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:41.480
 is a character that besides having 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:43.550
 presence in nine of the books of the 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:45.650
 saga has a book of its own with stories 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:47.540
 short so the construction of that 

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:50.840
 character is very cool lives during 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:52.910
 many years is a super wonderful wizard 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:55.040
 is bisexual and therefore tells you 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:57.410
 Absolutely all kinds of experiences 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:01:00.230
 of both sexes has all the glitter 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:02.360
 is wonderful is wonderful 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:03.680
 it's great and if you have not read the 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:05.630
 cassandra clare books please 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:07.759
 read them my favorite character from a 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:09.079
 movie would be v of vendetta v because 

00:01:07.759 --> 00:01:10.939
 although the graphic novel has also 

00:01:09.079 --> 00:01:12.950
 liked a lot I think the character in 

00:01:10.939 --> 00:01:15.079
 the movie is much better 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:16.670
 carried in the sense that it is super 

00:01:15.079 --> 00:01:19.009
 I live and will go through life as planned 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:20.840
 being a divo and the moment is at 

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:22.310
 beginning of the movie when one 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:23.479
 You need at the beginning but good 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:25.610
 moment is where it gets like 

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:27.920
 direct the orchestra and what happens then 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:30.140
 I think it's wonderful and great and I do not 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:32.299
 I know is a super super super character 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:33.829
 super cool if you have not seen I'm going to 

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:35.780
 vendetta well also see it because it is 

00:01:33.829 --> 00:01:37.969
 wonderful my favorite character of 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:39.590
 Animation movie is from inbound 

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:42.229
 of how to train your dragon '1 and 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:43.880
 they will comment your dragon 2 is a character 

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:45.319
 because he really is a dragon, so 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:47.750
 it does not feel like the character category 

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:50.149
 but I do not know is someone good to sponsor 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:52.819
 is something I want to embrace I want 

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:54.349
 be with him and I want not to shrink him 

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:56.990
 and it's already there to have a toothless 

00:01:54.349 --> 00:01:58.849
 valuable I want one is that I need it 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:59.929
 I need it 

00:01:58.849 --> 00:02:01.310
 Now I have to say a character 

00:01:59.929 --> 00:02:03.679
 favorite of a series and I think I'm going to 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:05.299
 say grade the mind facayvi that is a 

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:06.649
 British series consisting of two 

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:08.360
 seasons and a third one 

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:09.739
 will debut shortly is a character 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:11.090
 with which I really do not have many 

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:13.280
 things in common but that really 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:14.750
 I get to understand I get to put on their 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:17.389
 skin and I think it's that the writers 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:19.280
 they are fabulous and they get that close 

00:02:17.389 --> 00:02:21.650
 that character although you do not have say 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:23.180
 a relationship I do not know if I'm 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:25.250
 explaining but good what I want 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:26.930
 to say is that this character is great 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:28.700
 very well carried very well built and 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:30.560
 therefore it is my favorite character of 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:32.810
 a series I think because it's right now 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:34.340
 I do not remember many series and 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:38.450
 last of the historical character 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:40.880
 favorite is lady gaga and sting I'm going to 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:42.440
 say lady gaga because affection has done 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:45.470
 history and is what there is 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:47.690
 napoleon ju cleopatra jo are nobody to 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:49.850
 side of this diva not seriously anymore in 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:51.380
 serious I did not know exactly who to put and 

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:53.209
 I say good because I'm going to put Lady Gaga 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:55.040
 how to put britney spears or michael 

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:56.900
 jackson really are characters that have 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:03:00.050
 made history so I think it 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:01.220
 deserves this position only beautiful friend and 

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:02.720
 This is where my collaboration comes in 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:04.519
 recruited has been very cool to have the 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:06.140
 opportunity to get out a little bit of what 

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:07.670
 I usually do because I have a channel 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:09.170
 books where he spoke after literature 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:10.610
 and those things are obviously called books 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:12.050
 for reading and below you will have the link 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:13.880
 surely for them to subscribe if 

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:16.640
 you want and then go out a little 

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:18.290
 of being the only literary environment is 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:20.209
 cool sometimes it has been a very 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:22.980
 entertaining has cost me enough to do 

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:25.470
 my top 5 and still and everything has not been 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:26.670
 5 because it would have to be 200 or 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:28.440
 something like that but I hope that I have 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:31.310
