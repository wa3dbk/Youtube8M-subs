walkthrough of the new iphone 5 okay so
with<00:01:49.680> that<00:01:49.799> let's<00:01:50.130> go<00:01:50.310> ahead<00:01:50.340> and<00:01:50.759> take<00:01:50.850> a<00:01:51.360> look

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
with that let's go ahead and take a look

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:54.319 
with that let's go ahead and take a look
at<00:01:51.630> what<00:01:51.659> else<00:01:51.930> is<00:01:52.049> in<00:01:52.200> the<00:01:52.290> box<00:01:52.939> this<00:01:53.939> here<00:01:54.299> is

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
at what else is in the box this here is

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:57.139 
at what else is in the box this here is
the<00:01:54.509> new<00:01:54.780> earpods<00:01:55.200> took<00:01:56.130> Apple<00:01:56.520> two<00:01:56.909> or<00:01:56.969> three

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
the new earpods took Apple two or three

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:00.170 
the new earpods took Apple two or three
years<00:01:57.299> to<00:01:57.659> develop<00:01:58.640> let's<00:01:59.640> put<00:01:59.790> that<00:01:59.909> sign

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
years to develop let's put that sign

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:03.319 
years to develop let's put that sign
come<00:02:00.450> back<00:02:00.600> to<00:02:00.750> it<00:02:00.840> later<00:02:01.009> this<00:02:02.009> year<00:02:02.070> you<00:02:02.790> may

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
come back to it later this year you may

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:06.560 
come back to it later this year you may
have<00:02:03.360> already<00:02:03.659> seen<00:02:03.990> the<00:02:04.799> charger<00:02:05.250> and<00:02:05.570> of

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
have already seen the charger and of

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:12.650 
have already seen the charger and of
course<00:02:06.979> the<00:02:07.979> you<00:02:08.989> lightning<00:02:10.250> cable<00:02:11.660> it's

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
course the you lightning cable it's

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:13.700 
course the you lightning cable it's
eight<00:02:12.900> percent<00:02:13.260> smaller

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
eight percent smaller

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:19.310 
eight percent smaller
the<00:02:14.130> 30-pin<00:02:14.760> connector<00:02:14.820> is<00:02:15.690> reversible<00:02:18.320> keep

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:19.320 
the 30-pin connector is reversible keep

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:21.920 
the 30-pin connector is reversible keep
in<00:02:19.470> mind<00:02:19.710> that<00:02:19.860> it<00:02:20.070> doesn't<00:02:20.580> charge<00:02:21.510> the

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
in mind that it doesn't charge the

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:25.910 
in mind that it doesn't charge the
iphone<00:02:22.050> 5<00:02:22.440> any<00:02:22.650> faster<00:02:23.160> nor<00:02:23.460> does<00:02:23.790> it<00:02:24.620> sync<00:02:25.620> any

iphone 5 any faster nor does it sync any

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.430 
iphone 5 any faster nor does it sync any
faster<00:02:26.490> than<00:02:26.670> the<00:02:26.790> 30-pin<00:02:27.240> connector<00:02:27.320> but<00:02:28.320> as

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
faster than the 30-pin connector but as

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.730 
faster than the 30-pin connector but as
I've<00:02:28.800> already<00:02:29.100> mentioned<00:02:29.220> it's<00:02:29.880> more<00:02:30.150> durable

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:30.740 
I've already mentioned it's more durable

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:35.930 
I've already mentioned it's more durable
it's<00:02:31.740> reversible<00:02:32.310> and<00:02:34.460> it's<00:02:35.460> eighty<00:02:35.730> percent

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
it's reversible and it's eighty percent

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:49.310 
it's reversible and it's eighty percent
smaller<00:02:46.340> I'm<00:02:47.340> gonna<00:02:47.460> go<00:02:47.700> ahead<00:02:47.850> and<00:02:48.330> unbox<00:02:48.840> the

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:49.320 
smaller I'm gonna go ahead and unbox the

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:51.380 
smaller I'm gonna go ahead and unbox the
earpods<00:02:49.920> and<00:02:50.310> show<00:02:50.700> you<00:02:50.760> what<00:02:51.000> they<00:02:51.150> look<00:02:51.180> like
