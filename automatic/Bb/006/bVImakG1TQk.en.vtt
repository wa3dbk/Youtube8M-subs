Lucario you're a bullet punch in mind
but<00:01:20.160> I<00:01:20.369> think<00:01:20.640> that<00:01:20.910> was<00:01:21.000> one<00:01:21.090> of<00:01:21.119> Jodi's<00:01:21.540> main

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
but I think that was one of Jodi's main

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.990 
but I think that was one of Jodi's main
trick<00:01:22.020> to<00:01:22.140> this<00:01:22.259> matchup<00:01:22.650> the<00:01:22.770> ability<00:01:23.040> to<00:01:23.100> use

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
trick to this matchup the ability to use

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.880 
trick to this matchup the ability to use
that<00:01:24.030> mega<00:01:24.570> lucario<00:01:25.140> which<00:01:25.320> hadn't<00:01:25.710> seen

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
that mega lucario which hadn't seen

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.469 
that mega lucario which hadn't seen
before<00:01:25.920> and<00:01:26.580> try<00:01:26.910> to<00:01:26.970> get<00:01:27.090> a<00:01:27.119> quick<00:01:27.300> knockout

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
before and try to get a quick knockout

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.359 
before and try to get a quick knockout
of<00:01:27.750> that<00:01:27.840> guard<00:01:28.020> apart<00:01:28.320> once<00:01:28.800> again<00:01:29.009> we<00:01:29.100> see<00:01:29.280> it

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
of that guard apart once again we see it

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.370 
of that guard apart once again we see it
very<00:01:29.670> low<00:01:29.940> and<00:01:30.180> range<00:01:30.360> of<00:01:30.509> Sam<00:01:30.660> storm<00:01:30.960> damage

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
very low and range of Sam storm damage

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:32.840 
very low and range of Sam storm damage
but<00:01:31.560> this<00:01:31.890> time<00:01:32.100> the<00:01:32.220> damage<00:01:32.399> looks<00:01:32.670> like<00:01:32.759> it

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
but this time the damage looks like it

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.999 
but this time the damage looks like it
may<00:01:32.970> have<00:01:33.060> been<00:01:33.180> done<00:01:33.740> Garchomp<00:01:34.740> still<00:01:34.920> in

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
may have been done Garchomp still in
