big boots on it those are called

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:21.560 
big boots on it those are called
floaters<00:00:18.900> floaters<00:00:19.170> yeah<00:00:20.039> you<00:00:20.730> got<00:00:21.179> it<00:00:21.210> really

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
floaters floaters yeah you got it really

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:22.970 
floaters floaters yeah you got it really
close<00:00:21.779> to<00:00:21.929> not<00:00:22.080> call<00:00:22.259> floaters<00:00:22.619> with<00:00:22.769> the<00:00:22.859> all

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
close to not call floaters with the all

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.070 
close to not call floaters with the all
card<00:00:23.250> floats<00:00:23.550> and<00:00:23.970> predominantly<00:00:24.390> use<00:00:24.810> floats

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
card floats and predominantly use floats

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.960

just fine now that we're up in the air
the<00:01:19.940> only<00:01:20.030> thing<00:01:20.240> you<00:01:20.330> may<00:01:20.450> notice<00:01:20.570> is<00:01:20.780> floats

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:21.020 
the only thing you may notice is floats

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:22.210 
the only thing you may notice is floats
is<00:01:21.200> you<00:01:21.320> have<00:01:21.500> to<00:01:21.560> set<00:01:21.710> your<00:01:21.800> trims<00:01:22.040> a<00:01:22.070> little

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:22.220 
is you have to set your trims a little

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:24.700 
is you have to set your trims a little
bit<00:01:22.310> different<00:01:22.640> you<00:01:22.759> may<00:01:23.240> have<00:01:23.420> to<00:01:23.630> address<00:01:24.440> it

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:24.710 
bit different you may have to address it

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:27.040 
bit different you may have to address it
for<00:01:25.009> the<00:01:25.759> way<00:01:25.880> the<00:01:26.000> floats<00:01:26.240> tend<00:01:26.479> to<00:01:26.600> cut<00:01:26.960> out

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:27.050 
for the way the floats tend to cut out

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:28.450 
for the way the floats tend to cut out
this<00:01:27.200> lifting<00:01:27.560> body<00:01:27.740> a<00:01:27.860> little<00:01:27.979> bit<00:01:28.070> create<00:01:28.430> a

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:28.460 
this lifting body a little bit create a

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:29.650 
this lifting body a little bit create a
little<00:01:28.610> more<00:01:28.729> drag<00:01:28.940> so<00:01:29.180> you<00:01:29.270> may<00:01:29.360> have<00:01:29.450> to<00:01:29.540> fly

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:29.660 
little more drag so you may have to fly

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:35.590 
little more drag so you may have to fly
with<00:01:29.780> a<00:01:29.810> little<00:01:29.960> more<00:01:30.050> power<00:01:30.280> so<00:01:34.600> dogs

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:35.600 
with a little more power so dogs
