00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
everywhere let's just get dead and now

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.710 
everywhere let's just get dead and now
to<00:01:34.799> make<00:01:35.070> you<00:01:35.250> put<00:01:35.460> two<00:01:35.640> blocks<00:01:35.880> down<00:01:35.970> you

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
to make you put two blocks down you

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:37.999 
to make you put two blocks down you
right-click<00:01:37.170> on<00:01:37.259> it<00:01:37.350> with<00:01:37.500> the<00:01:37.590> hammer<00:01:37.710> and

then<00:01:38.850> we<00:01:38.939> can<00:01:39.060> start<00:01:39.299> making<00:01:39.509> this<00:01:39.810> now<00:01:40.070> I'll

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
then we can start making this now I'll

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.830 
then we can start making this now I'll
try<00:01:41.850> to<00:01:41.909> explain<00:01:42.000> everything<00:01:42.329> if<00:01:42.600> you<00:01:42.689> guys

try to explain everything if you guys

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.240 
try to explain everything if you guys
have<00:01:42.990> used<00:01:43.170> like<00:01:43.259> an<00:01:43.350> animation<00:01:43.680> program<00:01:44.100> it's

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
have used like an animation program it's

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:45.710 
have used like an animation program it's
sort<00:01:44.399> of<00:01:44.490> like<00:01:44.579> this<00:01:45.000> but<00:01:45.180> a<00:01:45.240> little<00:01:45.450> bit<00:01:45.540> more

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
sort of like this but a little bit more

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.469 
sort of like this but a little bit more
simplistic<00:01:46.649> so<00:01:47.009> this<00:01:47.399> one<00:01:47.610> controls<00:01:48.180> the

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
simplistic so this one controls the

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.210 
simplistic so this one controls the
right<00:01:48.750> arm<00:01:48.810> this<00:01:49.200> one<00:01:49.350> controls<00:01:49.740> the<00:01:49.799> left<00:01:50.009> arm

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
right arm this one controls the left arm

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:51.920 
right arm this one controls the left arm
you<00:01:50.909> guys<00:01:51.060> can<00:01:51.240> position<00:01:51.420> these<00:01:51.659> house<00:01:51.810> you

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
you guys can position these house you

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:53.389 
you guys can position these house you
want<00:01:52.079> it's<00:01:52.229> a<00:01:52.290> little<00:01:52.619> bit<00:01:52.710> confusing<00:01:53.130> to<00:01:53.280> get

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
want it's a little bit confusing to get

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.160 
want it's a little bit confusing to get
right<00:01:53.640> sort<00:01:54.270> of<00:01:54.329> tricky<00:01:54.630> so<00:01:54.689> let's<00:01:54.930> just<00:01:55.049> do

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
right sort of tricky so let's just do

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.469 
right sort of tricky so let's just do
something<00:01:55.200> like<00:01:55.439> this<00:01:55.850> this<00:01:56.850> one<00:01:57.030> controls

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
something like this this one controls

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.780 
something like this this one controls

the<00:02:02.549> head<00:02:03.049> and<00:02:04.049> this<00:02:04.380> one<00:02:04.560> controls<00:02:05.040> the<00:02:05.219> way

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
the head and this one controls the way

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.370 
the head and this one controls the way
the<00:02:05.640> play<00:02:05.850> is<00:02:05.969> rotated<00:02:06.450> the<00:02:06.570> body's<00:02:06.990> rotated
