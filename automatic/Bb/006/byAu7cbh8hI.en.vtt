expect rolling into the set usually

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:33.580 
expect rolling into the set usually
they're<00:00:31.460> more<00:00:32.000> predominant<00:00:32.599> cards<00:00:32.930> that<00:00:33.140> got

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:33.590 
they're more predominant cards that got

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:36.009

you know evaluated or you considered on
the<00:00:36.110> banned<00:00:36.290> list<00:00:36.460> I'm<00:00:37.460> kind<00:00:37.820> of<00:00:37.970> thinking

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:38.210 
the banned list I'm kind of thinking

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:40.960 
the banned list I'm kind of thinking
about<00:00:38.660> that<00:00:38.870> all<00:00:38.900> T<00:00:39.199> my<00:00:39.379> geeky<00:00:39.760> it's<00:00:40.760> been<00:00:40.940> a

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:40.970 
about that all T my geeky it's been a

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:43.960 
about that all T my geeky it's been a
little<00:00:41.210> bit<00:00:41.330> you<00:00:42.320> know<00:00:42.350> it's<00:00:43.010> been<00:00:43.220> out<00:00:43.430> hasn't

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:43.970 
little bit you know it's been out hasn't

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:46.270 
little bit you know it's been out hasn't
done<00:00:44.150> much<00:00:44.420> I<00:00:45.080> think<00:00:45.710> it<00:00:45.830> would<00:00:45.920> be<00:00:45.949> a<00:00:46.070> good

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:46.280 
done much I think it would be a good

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:49.630 
done much I think it would be a good
looking<00:00:46.580> all<00:00:46.699> T<00:00:46.850> my<00:00:47.780> own<00:00:48.019> personal<00:00:48.769> request<00:00:49.220> I

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:49.640 
looking all T my own personal request I

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:52.060 
looking all T my own personal request I
would<00:00:50.930> bricks<00:00:51.199> over<00:00:51.559> an<00:00:51.650> ultimate

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:52.070 
would bricks over an ultimate

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:55.000 
would bricks over an ultimate
course<00:00:52.339> I<00:00:52.879> think<00:00:53.330> that<00:00:53.479> would<00:00:53.629> be<00:00:53.839> like<00:00:54.769> the

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:55.010 
course I think that would be like the

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:58.149 
course I think that would be like the
spicy<00:00:55.309> meatball<00:00:55.940> on<00:00:56.210> top<00:00:56.299> of<00:00:56.989> the<00:00:57.170> you<00:00:58.040> know

00:00:58.149 --> 00:00:58.159

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:01.670 
sugar coated candy cane tree but it's

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:03.579 
sugar coated candy cane tree but it's
just<00:01:02.000> some<00:01:02.510> of<00:01:02.629> the<00:01:02.689> more<00:01:02.839> realistic<00:01:03.290> stuff

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:03.589
