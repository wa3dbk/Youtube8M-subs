Florida<00:00:30.890> Mouse<00:00:31.039> out<00:00:31.310> here<00:00:31.670> you<00:00:31.759> might<00:00:31.939> also

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:32.090 
Florida Mouse out here you might also

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:34.150 
Florida Mouse out here you might also
have<00:00:32.360> old<00:00:32.660> filled<00:00:32.930> mice<00:00:33.140> and<00:00:33.620> we<00:00:33.800> have<00:00:33.920> cotton

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:34.160 
have old filled mice and we have cotton

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:36.549 
have old filled mice and we have cotton
rats<00:00:34.430> occasionally<00:00:35.269> and<00:00:35.480> we<00:00:36.199> also<00:00:36.320> have

00:00:36.549 --> 00:00:36.559 
rats occasionally and we also have

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:39.729 
rats occasionally and we also have
harvest<00:00:36.980> mice<00:00:37.129> so<00:00:37.580> we<00:00:38.239> identify<00:00:38.809> it<00:00:38.870> first<00:00:39.229> we

00:00:39.729 --> 00:00:39.739 
harvest mice so we identify it first we

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:41.770 
harvest mice so we identify it first we
tag<00:00:40.129> everything<00:00:40.699> with<00:00:40.820> unique<00:00:41.120> ear<00:00:41.299> tag<00:00:41.540> so

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:41.780 
tag everything with unique ear tag so

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:43.240 
tag everything with unique ear tag so
that<00:00:41.809> we<00:00:41.989> can<00:00:42.170> tell<00:00:42.589> when<00:00:42.769> we<00:00:42.860> capture<00:00:43.190> it

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:43.250 
that we can tell when we capture it

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:45.969 
that we can tell when we capture it
again<00:00:43.489> we<00:00:44.059> look<00:00:44.479> for<00:00:44.780> gender<00:00:45.199> and<00:00:45.559> whether<00:00:45.860> or

00:00:45.969 --> 00:00:45.979 
again we look for gender and whether or

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:48.189 
again we look for gender and whether or
not<00:00:46.040> it's<00:00:46.250> reproductively<00:00:46.850> active<00:00:47.080> we<00:00:48.080> get

00:00:48.189 --> 00:00:48.199 
not it's reproductively active we get

00:00:48.199 --> 00:00:50.490 
not it's reproductively active we get
the<00:00:48.320> age<00:00:48.440> on<00:00:48.710> the<00:00:48.830> animal<00:00:49.129> is<00:00:49.820> that<00:00:50.000> a<00:00:50.030> female

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:50.500 
the age on the animal is that a female

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:52.479 
the age on the animal is that a female
actually<00:00:51.500> it<00:00:51.799> is<00:00:51.949> a<00:00:51.979> female

00:00:52.479 --> 00:00:52.489 
actually it is a female

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:54.789 
actually it is a female
we<00:00:53.390> are<00:00:53.510> trapping<00:00:53.989> at<00:00:54.170> gopher<00:00:54.379> tortoise

00:00:54.789 --> 00:00:54.799 
we are trapping at gopher tortoise

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:56.049 
we are trapping at gopher tortoise
burrows<00:00:55.070> which<00:00:55.220> is<00:00:55.339> a<00:00:55.369> little<00:00:55.640> different<00:00:55.790> than

00:00:56.049 --> 00:00:56.059 
burrows which is a little different than

00:00:56.059 --> 00:00:57.250 
burrows which is a little different than
some<00:00:56.269> small<00:00:56.390> mammal<00:00:56.750> trapping<00:00:56.839> where<00:00:57.199> you

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:57.260 
some small mammal trapping where you

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:58.869 
some small mammal trapping where you
would<00:00:57.379> just<00:00:57.530> trap<00:00:57.769> straight<00:00:58.339> grids<00:00:58.610> or<00:00:58.820> a

00:00:58.869 --> 00:00:58.879 
would just trap straight grids or a

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:00.460 
would just trap straight grids or a
transect<00:00:59.360> one<00:00:59.510> so<00:00:59.720> we're<00:00:59.839> trapping<00:01:00.049> at<00:01:00.229> gopher

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:00.470 
transect one so we're trapping at gopher

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:02.500 
transect one so we're trapping at gopher
tortoise<00:01:00.710> burrows<00:01:01.010> and<00:01:01.400> we<00:01:02.150> make<00:01:02.299> sure<00:01:02.390> there

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:02.510 
tortoise burrows and we make sure there

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:04.149 
tortoise burrows and we make sure there
are<00:01:02.600> no<00:01:02.689> fire<00:01:02.900> ants<00:01:03.110> that<00:01:03.229> are<00:01:03.290> there<00:01:03.530> if<00:01:03.920> we

00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:04.159 
are no fire ants that are there if we

are no fire ants that are there if we
find<00:01:04.430> fire<00:01:04.699> ants<00:01:04.939> we<00:01:05.269> move<00:01:06.140> the<00:01:06.290> traps<00:01:06.560> away

00:01:06.969 --> 00:01:06.979 
find fire ants we move the traps away

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:08.289 
find fire ants we move the traps away
from<00:01:07.189> that<00:01:07.310> particular<00:01:07.490> gopher<00:01:08.060> tortoise

00:01:08.289 --> 00:01:08.299 
from that particular gopher tortoise

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:10.570 
from that particular gopher tortoise
burrow<00:01:08.479> and<00:01:08.750> when<00:01:09.229> we<00:01:09.560> take<00:01:10.010> them<00:01:10.189> out<00:01:10.310> of<00:01:10.369> the

field<00:01:10.789> during<00:01:11.000> the<00:01:11.179> day<00:01:11.329> we<00:01:11.479> put<00:01:11.659> them<00:01:11.780> up<00:01:11.929> in<00:01:12.020> a

00:01:12.099 --> 00:01:12.109 
field during the day we put them up in a

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:14.169 
field during the day we put them up in a
tree<00:01:12.350> so<00:01:12.590> that<00:01:12.619> the<00:01:12.829> fire<00:01:13.280> ants<00:01:13.579> don't<00:01:13.700> don't

get to them we also never bait with
anything<00:01:16.250> but<00:01:16.429> seed<00:01:16.759> so<00:01:17.270> sometimes<00:01:17.869> people

00:01:18.039 --> 00:01:18.049 
anything but seed so sometimes people

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:19.810 
anything but seed so sometimes people
want<00:01:18.259> to<00:01:18.380> bait<00:01:18.530> small<00:01:18.950> mammal<00:01:19.280> traps<00:01:19.549> with

we never use that in Florida because of

we never use that in Florida because of

mouse and if we have a mouse mortality
related<00:01:30.920> to<00:01:31.219> fire<00:01:31.369> ants<00:01:31.579> we<00:01:31.670> pull<00:01:31.880> the<00:01:31.999> traps

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:32.210 
related to fire ants we pull the traps

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:33.730 
related to fire ants we pull the traps
and<00:01:32.390> we<00:01:32.450> do<00:01:32.570> not<00:01:32.689> trap<00:01:32.929> that<00:01:33.049> station<00:01:33.439> anymore

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:33.740 
and we do not trap that station anymore

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:37.779 
and we do not trap that station anymore
here's<00:01:34.340> your<00:01:34.429> trap<00:01:34.670> and<00:01:36.039> we<00:01:37.039> would<00:01:37.159> put<00:01:37.340> seeds

00:01:37.779 --> 00:01:37.789 
here's your trap and we would put seeds

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:40.209 
here's your trap and we would put seeds
in<00:01:38.030> and<00:01:38.270> bedding<00:01:38.929> because<00:01:39.409> it's<00:01:39.619> it's<00:01:39.950> cool

00:01:40.209 --> 00:01:40.219 
in and bedding because it's it's cool

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:42.669 
in and bedding because it's it's cool
for<00:01:40.579> the<00:01:41.299> mouse<00:01:41.450> so<00:01:41.869> we<00:01:41.990> put<00:01:42.200> the<00:01:42.319> seeds<00:01:42.499> and

00:01:42.669 --> 00:01:42.679 
for the mouse so we put the seeds and

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:44.620 
for the mouse so we put the seeds and
the<00:01:42.740> bedding<00:01:43.009> in<00:01:43.159> and<00:01:43.399> then<00:01:44.090> we<00:01:44.210> have<00:01:44.359> to<00:01:44.479> make

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:44.630 
the bedding in and then we have to make

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:46.989 
the bedding in and then we have to make
sure<00:01:44.810> that<00:01:44.960> the<00:01:45.079> trap<00:01:45.319> closes<00:01:45.789> fairly<00:01:46.789> easily

00:01:46.989 --> 00:01:46.999 
sure that the trap closes fairly easily

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:49.029 
sure that the trap closes fairly easily
so<00:01:47.659> the<00:01:47.749> mouse<00:01:47.929> is<00:01:48.109> to<00:01:48.259> run<00:01:48.439> in<00:01:48.590> here<00:01:48.829> and

00:01:49.029 --> 00:01:49.039 
so the mouse is to run in here and

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:51.309 
so the mouse is to run in here and
there's<00:01:49.880> a<00:01:49.939> plate<00:01:50.240> at<00:01:50.389> the<00:01:50.509> back<00:01:50.659> that<00:01:51.139> when

00:01:51.309 --> 00:01:51.319 
there's a plate at the back that when

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:52.690 
there's a plate at the back that when
the<00:01:51.409> mouse<00:01:51.560> steps<00:01:51.859> on<00:01:52.009> it<00:01:52.130> causes<00:01:52.429> the<00:01:52.520> door

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:52.700 
the mouse steps on it causes the door

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:55.610 
the mouse steps on it causes the door
closed

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:55.620 

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:58.530 

keep<00:01:56.620> it<00:01:56.770> flat<00:01:57.610> on<00:01:57.670> the<00:01:57.970> front<00:01:58.210> because<00:01:58.420> the

00:01:58.530 --> 00:01:58.540 
keep it flat on the front because the

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:00.000 
keep it flat on the front because the
mice<00:01:58.690> don't<00:01:58.930> necessarily<00:01:59.440> like<00:01:59.590> to<00:01:59.710> go<00:01:59.800> up

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:00.010 
mice don't necessarily like to go up

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:03.060 
mice don't necessarily like to go up
over<00:02:00.220> a<00:02:00.400> seal<00:02:00.700> and<00:02:00.940> this<00:02:01.360> is<00:02:01.510> actually<00:02:01.870> we<00:02:02.070> put

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:03.070 
over a seal and this is actually we put

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:05.040 
over a seal and this is actually we put
cover<00:02:03.400> over<00:02:03.820> it<00:02:03.940> to<00:02:04.390> make<00:02:04.540> sure<00:02:04.570> it<00:02:04.810> stays
