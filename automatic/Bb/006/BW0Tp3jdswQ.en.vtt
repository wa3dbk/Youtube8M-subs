00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:12.450
 Hi, people here at home, but we give a good 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:14.190
 recently invented the 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.109
 chicken and sausage hamburger that stays 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.150
 sensational and to accompany a 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:23.820
 sada potato with lemon is one 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:27.119
 delicious Let's go there 500 grams of breast of 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:32.669
 chicken 3 tablespoons of flour 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:36.170
 oatmeal 3 sausage chicken parsley juice 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:38.489
 of lemon salt and pepper to taste 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:40.140
 to make a great chicken I go 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.059
 I need to grind the chicken so I go 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.129
 drop a blender here 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:46.559
 but if you find it already crushed then 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:49.140
 You skip this part I'm going to put the 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:51.559
 few keystrokes until the 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.559
 well crushed 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:01:01.989
 the chicken I 've already caught will now prepare 

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:04.269
 the sausage I'll take her the skin 

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:05.680
 Only you squeeze it out 

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:07.630
 and here I am using a sausage 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:10.740
 chicken but if you want you can use 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:10.740
 robots friends cane too 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:16.609
 and now I'm going to give a piccadinha because at 

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:18.350
 Sometimes it comes very close together in pieces. 

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:21.880
 big there so you give a good 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:21.880
 prepared to be okay reading 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:25.990
 I'll join as a chicken and now I'll just 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:28.579
 temperature 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:30.229
 I'll add that the temperinhas but 

00:01:28.579 --> 00:01:32.179
 you can add whatever you want 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:37.780
 What do you like, I'm going to put a 

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:37.780
 little parsley lemon juice 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:47.179
 salt and pepper and if you want 

00:01:43.579 --> 00:01:49.429
 you can put another 500 also just not 

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:51.110
 forget that the sausage is already seasoned 

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:54.349
 then you have to take care were also 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:56.119
 used and for the league I'm going to use here 

00:01:54.349 --> 00:01:58.039
 oatmeal but you can use 

00:01:56.119 --> 00:02:00.439
 also the flour or flour 

00:01:58.039 --> 00:02:01.759
 of wheat that works too, I'm going 

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:04.849
 adding gradually because I do not 

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:10.149
 I want it to be very hard then 

00:02:04.849 --> 00:02:10.149
 I'll leave it firm but soft 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:19.090
 the point of mass is when you can 

00:02:17.379 --> 00:02:19.780
 make the balls to model the 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:21.640
 hamburger 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:23.379
 so I'll model here I will not change 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:28.150
 a very high burger because otherwise 

00:02:23.379 --> 00:02:30.220
 It's difficult to eat, I'll finish 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:32.079
 model all my hamburgers 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:34.269
 put in a paper-lined form 

00:02:32.079 --> 00:02:36.390
 butter and take pro 15 while preparing 

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:39.579
 potato 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:41.079
 I will prepare potato I've cooked it 

00:02:39.579 --> 00:02:42.940
 a little bit in the water for about ten 

00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:45.549
 long enough to stay 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:48.160
 little but I was going to do it in the shell more 

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:50.819
 there is optional you do if you want me 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:53.140
 I'll put it here on a platter. 

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:57.640
 juice the juice of half a lemon 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:03:00.390
 leftovers and scrapings of an animal can be 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:03.569
 also a little spicy paprika 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:03.569
 pepper 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:08.200
 I'll use a bit of margarine 

00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:13.030
 but you can also use olive oil if you 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:16.440
 Preferences 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:16.440
 mix everything very well 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:21.470
 now it 's okay, I'll go 

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:23.870
 take it out and put it all a layer 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:25.879
 Just to be all right, Radinho, and that's it. 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:28.849
 bake at the highest temperature 

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:31.069
 that you have it preheated for 15 

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:33.700
 minutes and it's good to come to the potato half 

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:36.379
 time to get golden on both sides 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:39.110
 while the potato ends, I alone 

00:03:36.379 --> 00:03:41.030
 I'll be a bug, I'll put it on 

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:43.099
 then nonstick skillet so 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:45.620
 I do not want fat because 

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:48.590
 opening this tournament has fat and I'm going 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:51.109
 Let it fry until it starts to feel good 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:54.109
 here in the middle for later 

00:03:51.109 --> 00:03:58.849
 turning already started to get white here 

00:03:54.109 --> 00:04:02.180
 below now is the time to become a 

00:03:58.849 --> 00:04:04.370
 Just shave it just a little bit 

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:05.959
 punch 

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:07.730
 I 'm going to start cheese cheese now. 

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:11.260
 You put what you want I'm 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:11.260
 using same mozzarella 

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:16.070
 and now just put the cap to drown 

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:18.609
 the melting cheese assembling your snack 

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:18.609
 enjoy 

00:04:24.009 --> 00:04:28.310
 I packed my lunch the way I did 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:29.840
 I like you, but you can ride your own way. 

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:32.350
 and tell me in the comments how 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:32.350
 you did 

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:42.110

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:52.040
