Shazam a big big as lightning bolt just
strikes<00:02:48.900> on<00:02:49.080> whoever<00:02:49.410> he<00:02:49.620> wants<00:02:49.890> and<00:02:50.070> that's

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:50.820 
strikes on whoever he wants and that's

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:52.130 
strikes on whoever he wants and that's
pretty<00:02:51.090> that's<00:02:51.330> pretty<00:02:51.660> cool<00:02:51.780> if<00:02:51.900> you<00:02:51.930> think

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
pretty that's pretty cool if you think

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:54.350 
pretty that's pretty cool if you think
about<00:02:52.170> his<00:02:52.740> weakness<00:02:53.190> I<00:02:53.430> believed<00:02:54.240> his

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360 
about his weakness I believed his

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:57.830 
about his weakness I believed his
weakness<00:02:54.720> is<00:02:54.780> just<00:02:55.490> if<00:02:56.490> he<00:02:56.550> talked<00:02:57.480> to<00:02:57.660> him<00:02:57.780> I

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
weakness is just if he talked to him I

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.290 
weakness is just if he talked to him I
guess<00:02:58.020> cuz<00:02:58.380> he<00:02:58.470> think<00:02:59.160> about<00:02:59.190> the<00:02:59.460> kid<00:02:59.730> stuck

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:00.300 
guess cuz he think about the kid stuck

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:02.300 
guess cuz he think about the kid stuck
in<00:03:00.330> a<00:03:00.480> grown<00:03:00.720> man's<00:03:00.960> body<00:03:01.290> so<00:03:01.740> I<00:03:01.770> guess<00:03:01.950> he

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 
in a grown man's body so I guess he

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:04.010 
in a grown man's body so I guess he
doesn't<00:03:02.460> have<00:03:02.670> the<00:03:02.700> mentality<00:03:02.970> of<00:03:03.300> a<00:03:03.630> grown-up

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:04.020 
doesn't have the mentality of a grown-up

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:06.890 
doesn't have the mentality of a grown-up
so<00:03:04.680> i<00:03:04.710> guess<00:03:04.980> like<00:03:05.220> when<00:03:06.090> he<00:03:06.150> fights<00:03:06.450> is<00:03:06.660> it's

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
so i guess like when he fights is it's

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:08.930 
so i guess like when he fights is it's
just<00:03:07.110> so<00:03:07.230> funny<00:03:07.590> and<00:03:07.680> corny<00:03:08.220> i<00:03:08.400> remember

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 
just so funny and corny i remember

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:11.450 
just so funny and corny i remember
watching<00:03:09.090> when<00:03:09.420> I<00:03:09.480> was<00:03:09.570> a<00:03:09.630> kid<00:03:09.660> huh<00:03:10.460> Shazam

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:11.460 
watching when I was a kid huh Shazam

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:13.190 
watching when I was a kid huh Shazam
kept<00:03:11.730> him<00:03:11.850> or<00:03:11.940> whatever<00:03:12.210> was<00:03:12.450> on<00:03:12.570> on<00:03:12.930> the

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200

kept him or whatever was on on the
Justice<00:03:13.470> League<00:03:13.680> and<00:03:13.950> he<00:03:14.190> was<00:03:14.310> just<00:03:14.340> they

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
Justice League and he was just they

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:16.040 
Justice League and he was just they
found<00:03:14.970> out<00:03:15.120> that<00:03:15.270> he<00:03:15.390> was<00:03:15.420> a<00:03:15.540> kid<00:03:15.780> and<00:03:16.020> then

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:16.050
