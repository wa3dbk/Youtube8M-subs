00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
just want to go ahead and curl it while

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:55.450 
just want to go ahead and curl it while

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:55.460 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:57.370 

so<00:01:56.180> what<00:01:56.390> we're<00:01:56.570> going<00:01:56.660> to<00:01:56.720> do<00:01:56.930> is<00:01:57.110> we're<00:01:57.290> going

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:57.380 
so what we're going to do is we're going

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:00.160 
so what we're going to do is we're going
to<00:01:57.440> take<00:01:57.710> the<00:01:58.250> first<00:01:58.550> section<00:01:58.940> which<00:01:59.780> is<00:01:59.930> over

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:00.170 
to take the first section which is over

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:01.990 
to take the first section which is over
here<00:02:00.290> we're<00:02:00.410> gonna<00:02:00.470> bring<00:02:00.740> it<00:02:00.950> I'll<00:02:01.520> do<00:02:01.790> it<00:02:01.820> in

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:02.000 
here we're gonna bring it I'll do it in

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.580 
here we're gonna bring it I'll do it in
the<00:02:02.060> mirror<00:02:02.330> I<00:02:02.510> think<00:02:02.720> it's<00:02:02.840> probably<00:02:03.110> easier

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:03.590 
the mirror I think it's probably easier

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:04.570
