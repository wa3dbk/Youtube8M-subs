 great reading will provoke from vat 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:37.120
 The team plays the ball calmly. 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:42.010

 wellington nor to play poker pec 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:57.760
 Counter-attacking seemed to be the preferred strategy of

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:10.960
 this tie in the first half is 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:12.520
 Surprised, Caio Thiago is not enough. 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:16.050
 Not surprised but I expected both 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:16.050
 teams seeking more victory 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:22.409

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:27.880
 the most toxic of active bacteria 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:30.600

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.400
 It's going pretty, it goes straight. 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:48.390
 0 to 0 does not like what we are 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:52.160
 seeing on the pitch since the defense is 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.160
 messy against attack promises 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:02.750
 the g4 the goalkeeper countered 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:12.490
 the head goal 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:19.620
 went to get the victory 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:27.329
 the scoreboard was opened my son fell 

00:02:24.719 --> 00:02:28.980
 Brook 1-0 than 100 really do not 

00:02:27.329 --> 00:02:31.819
 It suited what we were seeing.
