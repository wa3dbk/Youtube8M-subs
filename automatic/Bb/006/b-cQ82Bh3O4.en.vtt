walk<00:00:13.289> you<00:00:13.469> back<00:00:13.590> to<00:00:13.799> inversion<00:00:14.280> 101<00:00:14.850> and<00:00:15.119> today

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
walk you back to inversion 101 and today

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.000 
walk you back to inversion 101 and today
we're<00:00:15.510> going<00:00:15.600> to<00:00:15.660> discuss<00:00:15.809> some<00:00:16.500> in-depth

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
we're going to discuss some in-depth

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.910 
we're going to discuss some in-depth
strategies<00:00:17.550> on<00:00:18.020> offensive<00:00:19.020> gameplay<00:00:19.560> for

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
strategies on offensive gameplay for

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.650 
strategies on offensive gameplay for
inversion<00:00:20.340> alright<00:00:21.120> so<00:00:21.360> let's<00:00:21.540> talk<00:00:21.600> about

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
inversion alright so let's talk about

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.150 
inversion alright so let's talk about
the<00:00:21.870> graveling<00:00:22.200> first<00:00:22.500> I<00:00:22.650> mean<00:00:22.770> the<00:00:22.830> gravel

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
the graveling first I mean the gravel

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:24.680 
the graveling first I mean the gravel
inc<00:00:23.250> is<00:00:23.400> what<00:00:23.550> everybody<00:00:23.940> is<00:00:24.030> always<00:00:24.270> asking

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:24.690 
inc is what everybody is always asking

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:26.090 
inc is what everybody is always asking
about<00:00:24.780> right<00:00:25.110> randomly<00:00:25.590> because<00:00:25.770> essentially

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:26.100 
about right randomly because essentially

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:27.920 
about right randomly because essentially
what's<00:00:26.400> gonna<00:00:26.550> let<00:00:26.760> you<00:00:26.880> command<00:00:27.270> gravity<00:00:27.780> I

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
what's gonna let you command gravity I

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:29.090 
what's gonna let you command gravity I
mean<00:00:28.230> you're<00:00:28.350> gonna<00:00:28.470> always<00:00:28.710> have<00:00:28.950> it<00:00:29.070> with

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:29.100 
mean you're gonna always have it with

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:31.100 
mean you're gonna always have it with
you<00:00:29.369> you<00:00:30.030> have<00:00:30.119> it<00:00:30.240> with<00:00:30.270> you<00:00:30.360> pretty<00:00:30.840> much<00:00:30.900> at

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:31.110 
you you have it with you pretty much at

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:32.389 
you you have it with you pretty much at
the<00:00:31.170> start<00:00:31.380> of<00:00:31.440> the<00:00:31.470> game<00:00:31.650> and<00:00:32.039> you<00:00:32.070> take<00:00:32.369> it

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
the start of the game and you take it

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.729 
the start of the game and you take it
from<00:00:32.669> the<00:00:32.820> enemy<00:00:32.940> take<00:00:33.510> it<00:00:33.660> use<00:00:33.989> it<00:00:34.140> as<00:00:34.230> a<00:00:34.260> tool

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
from the enemy take it use it as a tool

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:35.960 
from the enemy take it use it as a tool
as<00:00:34.949> we<00:00:35.039> rent<00:00:35.219> right<00:00:35.430> it's<00:00:35.610> going<00:00:35.760> to<00:00:35.820> let<00:00:35.910> you

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:35.970 
as we rent right it's going to let you

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:38.210 
as we rent right it's going to let you
do<00:00:36.090> all<00:00:36.120> these<00:00:36.450> cool<00:00:36.630> things<00:00:36.690> and<00:00:37.230> grab<00:00:38.010> link

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:38.220 
do all these cool things and grab link

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:40.430 
do all these cool things and grab link
itself<00:00:38.489> is<00:00:38.760> actually<00:00:39.210> a<00:00:39.480> weapon<00:00:39.780> so<00:00:40.110> the<00:00:40.260> grab

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
itself is actually a weapon so the grab

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:41.930 
itself is actually a weapon so the grab
link<00:00:40.680> is<00:00:40.800> a<00:00:40.829> weapon<00:00:41.250> so<00:00:41.370> just<00:00:41.579> in<00:00:41.670> case<00:00:41.790> you

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
link is a weapon so just in case you

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.190 
link is a weapon so just in case you
didn't<00:00:42.120> know<00:00:42.210> use<00:00:42.450> the<00:00:42.480> grav<00:00:42.780> link<00:00:43.050> and

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
didn't know use the grav link and

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.720 
didn't know use the grav link and
experiment<00:00:43.710> with<00:00:43.739> the<00:00:43.890> pick<00:00:44.100> things<00:00:44.280> up<00:00:44.520> and

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
experiment with the pick things up and

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.880 
experiment with the pick things up and
show<00:00:45.239> it<00:00:45.360> all<00:00:45.450> around<00:00:45.750> let's<00:00:46.350> talk<00:00:46.530> about<00:00:46.680> the

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
show it all around let's talk about the

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.590 
show it all around let's talk about the
combinations<00:00:47.489> that<00:00:47.550> you<00:00:47.670> can<00:00:47.910> use<00:00:48.180> with<00:00:48.510> the

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
combinations that you can use with the

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.720 
combinations that you can use with the
graveling<00:00:48.960> so<00:00:49.230> right<00:00:49.739> now<00:00:49.770> an<00:00:50.010> example<00:00:50.579> that<00:00:50.670> I

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
graveling so right now an example that I

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.520 
graveling so right now an example that I
want<00:00:50.970> to<00:00:51.030> jump<00:00:51.210> into<00:00:51.390> is<00:00:51.780> the<00:00:52.140> use<00:00:52.290> of<00:00:52.320> the

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
want to jump into is the use of the

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.280 
want to jump into is the use of the
graveling<00:00:52.980> and<00:00:53.220> low<00:00:54.120> gravity<00:00:54.420> so<00:00:54.870> the<00:00:54.989> gravel

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:55.290 
graveling and low gravity so the gravel

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:56.930 
graveling and low gravity so the gravel
inc<00:00:55.410> is<00:00:55.620> strategic<00:00:56.309> you<00:00:56.520> can't<00:00:56.730> use<00:00:56.850> the

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
inc is strategic you can't use the

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.370 
inc is strategic you can't use the
gravelly<00:00:57.270> anywhere<00:00:57.660> you<00:00:57.750> want<00:00:57.989> what<00:00:58.230> you<00:00:58.350> have

00:00:58.370 --> 00:00:58.380 
gravelly anywhere you want what you have

00:00:58.380 --> 00:00:59.959 
gravelly anywhere you want what you have
to<00:00:58.530> do<00:00:58.649> is<00:00:58.860> you<00:00:59.219> have<00:00:59.309> to<00:00:59.399> kind<00:00:59.489> of<00:00:59.579> plan<00:00:59.790> out

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
to do is you have to kind of plan out

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.780 
to do is you have to kind of plan out
exactly<00:01:00.360> where<00:01:00.719> and<00:01:00.960> how<00:01:01.590> best<00:01:01.950> to<00:01:02.129> users<00:01:02.460> so

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:02.790 
exactly where and how best to users so

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:04.639 
exactly where and how best to users so
for<00:01:03.000> example<00:01:03.090> when<00:01:04.079> you're<00:01:04.199> starting<00:01:04.350> on<00:01:04.559> the

00:01:04.639 --> 00:01:04.649 
for example when you're starting on the

00:01:04.649 --> 00:01:05.749 
for example when you're starting on the
game<00:01:04.829> you're<00:01:05.040> probably<00:01:05.189> gonna<00:01:05.369> have<00:01:05.460> about

00:01:05.749 --> 00:01:05.759 
game you're probably gonna have about

00:01:05.759 --> 00:01:08.539 
game you're probably gonna have about
two<00:01:06.030> or<00:01:06.210> three<00:01:06.479> shots<00:01:06.750> of<00:01:07.170> low<00:01:07.770> gravity<00:01:08.039> so

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
two or three shots of low gravity so

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.010 
two or three shots of low gravity so
what<00:01:08.700> you<00:01:08.819> can<00:01:08.909> do<00:01:09.030> is<00:01:09.149> you<00:01:09.270> can<00:01:09.299> use<00:01:09.420> that<00:01:09.719> on

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
what you can do is you can use that on

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.169 
what you can do is you can use that on
that<00:01:10.439> sniper<00:01:10.770> that's<00:01:11.340> hiding<00:01:11.549> behind<00:01:11.819> cover

00:01:12.169 --> 00:01:12.179 
that sniper that's hiding behind cover

00:01:12.179 --> 00:01:14.449 
that sniper that's hiding behind cover
you<00:01:12.420> can<00:01:12.569> pull<00:01:12.749> up<00:01:12.780> on<00:01:13.020> a<00:01:13.049> cover<00:01:13.350> and<00:01:14.069> then<00:01:14.340> you

00:01:14.449 --> 00:01:14.459 
you can pull up on a cover and then you

00:01:14.459 --> 00:01:16.669 
you can pull up on a cover and then you
can<00:01:14.609> use<00:01:14.999> that<00:01:15.179> as<00:01:15.359> a<00:01:15.749> way<00:01:15.899> to<00:01:16.020> distract<00:01:16.499> them

00:01:16.669 --> 00:01:16.679 
can use that as a way to distract them

00:01:16.679 --> 00:01:19.519 
can use that as a way to distract them
his<00:01:17.159> aim<00:01:17.459> isn't<00:01:17.700> gonna<00:01:17.850> be<00:01:17.999> as<00:01:18.090> good<00:01:18.319> later<00:01:19.319> on

00:01:19.519 --> 00:01:19.529 
his aim isn't gonna be as good later on

00:01:19.529 --> 00:01:20.870 
his aim isn't gonna be as good later on
what<00:01:19.709> you<00:01:19.829> get<00:01:19.950> a<00:01:19.979> little<00:01:20.100> bit<00:01:20.249> better<00:01:20.369> obvious

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
what you get a little bit better obvious

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.309 
what you get a little bit better obvious
you<00:01:20.999> can<00:01:21.179> put<00:01:21.600> them<00:01:21.719> up<00:01:21.810> in<00:01:21.929> the<00:01:22.020> low<00:01:22.109> gravity

00:01:22.309 --> 00:01:22.319 
you can put them up in the low gravity

00:01:22.319 --> 00:01:24.620 
you can put them up in the low gravity
and<00:01:23.009> then<00:01:23.189> grab<00:01:23.670> an<00:01:23.819> object<00:01:24.299> out<00:01:24.420> of<00:01:24.539> the

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
and then grab an object out of the

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.090 
and then grab an object out of the
environment<00:01:25.109> and<00:01:25.170> throw<00:01:25.350> it<00:01:25.469> at<00:01:25.590> them<00:01:25.679> for<00:01:25.920> one

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
environment and throw it at them for one

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.649 
environment and throw it at them for one
shot<00:01:26.279> kill<00:01:26.549> that's<00:01:26.969> a<00:01:27.090> really<00:01:27.359> really<00:01:27.539> cool

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
shot kill that's a really really cool

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:28.969 
shot kill that's a really really cool
thing<00:01:27.990> now<00:01:28.109> lets<00:01:28.350> you<00:01:28.560> know<00:01:28.649> we<00:01:28.740> touch<00:01:28.950> a

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
thing now lets you know we touch a

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.129 
thing now lets you know we touch a
little<00:01:29.219> bit<00:01:29.340> up<00:01:29.549> on<00:01:29.729> low<00:01:30.329> gravity<00:01:30.630> let's<00:01:30.929> film

00:01:31.129 --> 00:01:31.139 
little bit up on low gravity let's film

00:01:31.139 --> 00:01:32.690 
little bit up on low gravity let's film
it<00:01:31.289> on<00:01:31.409> high<00:01:31.649> like<00:01:32.039> what's<00:01:32.279> a<00:01:32.399> cool

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
it on high like what's a cool

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.690 
it on high like what's a cool
situational<00:01:33.630> thing<00:01:33.659> that<00:01:34.020> I'll<00:01:34.380> be<00:01:34.679> put<00:01:34.950> in<00:01:35.099> to

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
situational thing that I'll be put in to

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.149 
situational thing that I'll be put in to
one<00:01:35.969> opt<00:01:36.270> out<00:01:36.479> to<00:01:36.659> use<00:01:36.929> high<00:01:37.259> gravity<00:01:37.529> so<00:01:38.009> high

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
one opt out to use high gravity so high

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:39.559 
one opt out to use high gravity so high
gravity<00:01:38.399> what<00:01:38.700> that's<00:01:38.880> going<00:01:38.999> to<00:01:39.060> do<00:01:39.209> is<00:01:39.359> going

00:01:39.559 --> 00:01:39.569 
gravity what that's going to do is going

00:01:39.569 --> 00:01:41.149 
gravity what that's going to do is going
to<00:01:39.630> increase<00:01:39.929> the<00:01:40.200> weight<00:01:40.380> you<00:01:40.740> know<00:01:40.859> three

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
to increase the weight you know three

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.010 
to increase the weight you know three
four<00:01:41.490> times<00:01:41.789> once<00:01:42.149> you<00:01:42.209> hit<00:01:42.329> an<00:01:42.450> enemy<00:01:42.599> with<00:01:42.869> it

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
four times once you hit an enemy with it

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.809 
four times once you hit an enemy with it
you<00:01:43.079> will<00:01:43.170> see<00:01:43.200> them<00:01:43.409> step<00:01:44.189> the<00:01:44.310> ground<00:01:44.579> it

00:01:44.809 --> 00:01:44.819 
you will see them step the ground it

00:01:44.819 --> 00:01:46.339 
you will see them step the ground it
kind<00:01:44.999> of<00:01:45.029> struggling<00:01:45.359> got<00:01:45.899> about<00:01:46.049> five

00:01:46.339 --> 00:01:46.349 
kind of struggling got about five

00:01:46.349 --> 00:01:48.109 
kind of struggling got about five
seconds<00:01:46.859> to<00:01:47.099> decide<00:01:47.520> what<00:01:47.729> you<00:01:47.819> want<00:01:47.969> to<00:01:47.999> do

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
seconds to decide what you want to do

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:48.640 
seconds to decide what you want to do
with<00:01:48.240> them

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:48.650 
with them

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:50.950 
with them
point<00:01:48.860> so<00:01:49.490> for<00:01:49.910> example<00:01:50.000> Richard<00:01:50.570> I<00:01:50.660> know<00:01:50.750> if

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:50.960 
point so for example Richard I know if

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:52.330 
point so for example Richard I know if
you're<00:01:51.080> really<00:01:51.260> good<00:01:51.500> at<00:01:51.530> up<00:01:51.770> close<00:01:52.010> combat

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:52.340 
you're really good at up close combat

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:53.920 
you're really good at up close combat
you<00:01:52.610> you're<00:01:53.030> like<00:01:53.150> they're<00:01:53.360> just<00:01:53.510> a<00:01:53.570> master<00:01:53.900> of

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:53.930 
you you're like they're just a master of

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:55.810 
you you're like they're just a master of
the<00:01:54.050> shotgun<00:01:54.470> mm-hmm<00:01:54.950> what<00:01:55.190> i<00:01:55.220> can<00:01:55.520> do<00:01:55.610> is<00:01:55.640> i

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:55.820 
the shotgun mm-hmm what i can do is i

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:57.640 
the shotgun mm-hmm what i can do is i
can<00:01:55.850> hit<00:01:56.060> him<00:01:56.150> with<00:01:56.300> heavy<00:01:56.480> gravity<00:01:56.690> you'll<00:01:57.530> be

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:57.650 
can hit him with heavy gravity you'll be

00:01:57.650 --> 00:01:58.840 
can hit him with heavy gravity you'll be
stuck<00:01:57.860> the<00:01:57.980> ground<00:01:58.190> and<00:01:58.340> i<00:01:58.400> can<00:01:58.520> just<00:01:58.640> kind<00:01:58.820> of

00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:58.850 
stuck the ground and i can just kind of

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:05.490 
stuck the ground and i can just kind of
you<00:01:59.000> to<00:01:59.120> run<00:01:59.270> up<00:01:59.420> and<00:01:59.600> take<00:01:59.780> care<00:01:59.930> of<00:01:59.990> them

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:05.500 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:07.870 

movement<00:02:06.500> mobility<00:02:07.039> is<00:02:07.250> an<00:02:07.460> important<00:02:07.850> thing

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:07.880 
movement mobility is an important thing

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:09.550 
movement mobility is an important thing
but<00:02:08.450> another<00:02:08.720> thing<00:02:08.959> you<00:02:09.110> need<00:02:09.229> to<00:02:09.349> touch<00:02:09.530> up

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:09.560 
but another thing you need to touch up

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:12.640 
but another thing you need to touch up
on<00:02:09.860> is<00:02:10.130> zero<00:02:10.520> gravity<00:02:10.849> zero<00:02:11.209> gravity<00:02:11.690> is<00:02:12.020> these

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:12.650 
on is zero gravity zero gravity is these

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:13.960 
on is zero gravity zero gravity is these
entire<00:02:12.950> portions<00:02:13.340> of<00:02:13.459> the<00:02:13.550> level<00:02:13.819> with<00:02:13.910> the

floating everything is always going to
be<00:02:17.810> constantly<00:02:18.200> floating<00:02:18.590> that<00:02:18.709> means

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:18.890 
be constantly floating that means

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:21.040 
be constantly floating that means
grenades<00:02:19.280> they<00:02:20.090> don't<00:02:20.239> land<00:02:20.450> they<00:02:20.810> go<00:02:20.959> and

grenades they don't land they go and

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:22.479 
grenades they don't land they go and
float<00:02:21.290> until<00:02:21.440> they<00:02:21.590> blow<00:02:21.769> up<00:02:21.800> so<00:02:22.220> how<00:02:22.340> am<00:02:22.430> I

00:02:22.479 --> 00:02:22.489 
float until they blow up so how am I

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:26.470 
float until they blow up so how am I
going<00:02:22.640> to<00:02:22.730> kill<00:02:22.910> people<00:02:23.319> easiest<00:02:24.319> way<00:02:25.480> instead

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:26.480 
going to kill people easiest way instead

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:27.820 
going to kill people easiest way instead
of<00:02:26.510> trying<00:02:26.630> to<00:02:26.750> flank<00:02:26.930> them<00:02:27.080> okay<00:02:27.500> I<00:02:27.530> can<00:02:27.650> flank

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:27.830 
of trying to flank them okay I can flank

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:29.620

you can check out your sniper rifle and

00:02:40.549 --> 00:02:42.460 
you can check out your sniper rifle and
you've<00:02:40.670> got<00:02:40.790> these<00:02:40.910> cool<00:02:41.150> mid<00:02:41.480> air<00:02:41.690> battles

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:42.470 
you've got these cool mid air battles

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:44.259 
you've got these cool mid air battles
where<00:02:42.650> you're<00:02:42.830> kind<00:02:42.980> of<00:02:43.069> shooting<00:02:43.489> into<00:02:43.760> your

00:02:44.259 --> 00:02:44.269 
where you're kind of shooting into your

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:45.339 
where you're kind of shooting into your
enemy<00:02:44.599> and<00:02:44.720> they'll<00:02:44.870> be<00:02:44.959> doing<00:02:45.049> the<00:02:45.200> same

00:02:45.339 --> 00:02:45.349 
enemy and they'll be doing the same

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:47.289 
enemy and they'll be doing the same
thing<00:02:45.590> to<00:02:45.680> you<00:02:45.799> so<00:02:46.549> it's<00:02:46.670> not<00:02:46.700> a<00:02:46.819> common<00:02:47.090> be

00:02:47.289 --> 00:02:47.299 
thing to you so it's not a common be

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:48.580 
thing to you so it's not a common be
darting<00:02:47.630> back<00:02:47.780> in<00:02:47.930> the<00:02:47.989> fourth<00:02:48.230> and<00:02:48.349> trying<00:02:48.530> to

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:48.590 
darting back in the fourth and trying to

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:50.470 
darting back in the fourth and trying to
get<00:02:48.680> that<00:02:48.890> line<00:02:49.280> up<00:02:49.430> that<00:02:49.580> perfect<00:02:49.940> shot<00:02:49.970> and

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:50.480 
get that line up that perfect shot and

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:55.800 
get that line up that perfect shot and
it<00:02:50.959> just<00:02:51.140> it<00:02:51.440> looks<00:02:51.620> cool<00:02:51.830> and<00:02:52.069> it<00:02:52.220> plays<00:02:52.370> great

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:55.810 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:57.789 

so<00:02:56.810> the<00:02:56.959> next<00:02:57.140> thing<00:02:57.260> that<00:02:57.380> we're<00:02:57.590> going<00:02:57.709> to

00:02:57.789 --> 00:02:57.799 
so the next thing that we're going to

00:02:57.799 --> 00:03:00.460 
so the next thing that we're going to
cover<00:02:57.980> is<00:02:58.250> vector<00:02:58.760> ships<00:02:59.239> so<00:02:59.989> vector<00:03:00.200> ships
