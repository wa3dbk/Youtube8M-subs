design director for the Lincoln MKT and

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:07.880 
design director for the Lincoln MKT and
I'm<00:00:06.750> going<00:00:06.899> to<00:00:06.960> take<00:00:07.140> you<00:00:07.319> around<00:00:07.440> a<00:00:07.770> little

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:07.890 
I'm going to take you around a little

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.070 
I'm going to take you around a little
bit<00:00:08.099> we're<00:00:08.250> very<00:00:08.460> excited<00:00:08.940> about<00:00:09.030> the<00:00:09.389> the<00:00:09.960> new

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.080 
bit we're very excited about the the new

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.350 
bit we're very excited about the the new
Lincoln<00:00:10.440> MKT<00:00:10.830> I<00:00:11.010> think<00:00:11.250> it's<00:00:11.370> important<00:00:11.880> to

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
Lincoln MKT I think it's important to

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.660 
Lincoln MKT I think it's important to
start<00:00:12.599> out<00:00:12.809> by<00:00:13.080> saying<00:00:13.160> that<00:00:14.160> no<00:00:14.190> longer

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
start out by saying that no longer

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.150 
start out by saying that no longer
Ford's<00:00:15.509> and<00:00:15.719> Lincoln's<00:00:16.230> they<00:00:16.830> will<00:00:17.010> no<00:00:17.130> longer

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
Ford's and Lincoln's they will no longer

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.720 
Ford's and Lincoln's they will no longer
share<00:00:17.760> sheetmetal<00:00:18.590> so<00:00:19.590> we've<00:00:20.130> had<00:00:20.369> two

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
share sheetmetal so we've had two

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.670 
share sheetmetal so we've had two
versions<00:00:20.939> of<00:00:21.300> that<00:00:21.449> the<00:00:21.630> MKS<00:00:22.020> is<00:00:22.380> the<00:00:22.500> very

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
versions of that the MKS is the very

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.590 
versions of that the MKS is the very
first<00:00:23.010> Lincoln<00:00:23.939> that's<00:00:24.119> that<00:00:24.390> had<00:00:24.570> a

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
first Lincoln that's that had a

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.900 
first Lincoln that's that had a
completely<00:00:25.080> different<00:00:25.199> top<00:00:25.710> hat<00:00:25.980> the<00:00:26.490> MKT

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
completely different top hat the MKT

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.650 
completely different top hat the MKT
that<00:00:27.330> I'm<00:00:27.449> with<00:00:27.660> today<00:00:28.019> is<00:00:28.230> the<00:00:28.740> second<00:00:29.660> now

little bit of the of the DNA that we use

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.560 
little bit of the of the DNA that we use
for<00:00:34.860> all<00:00:34.890> of<00:00:35.010> our<00:00:35.219> lincoln<00:00:35.670> design<00:00:36.059> products

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
we decided it so it's just this clean

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:58.370 
we decided it so it's just this clean
surface<00:01:56.820> coming<00:01:57.119> all<00:01:57.390> the<00:01:57.630> way<00:01:57.659> through<00:01:58.170> and

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
surface coming all the way through and

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.230 
surface coming all the way through and
it<00:01:58.799> just<00:01:59.040> gives<00:01:59.250> the<00:01:59.399> whole<00:01:59.430> vehicle<00:02:00.000> an

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
it just gives the whole vehicle an

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.749 
it just gives the whole vehicle an
extremely<00:02:01.110> modern<00:02:01.140> very<00:02:01.890> very<00:02:02.219> cosmopolitan

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
extremely modern very very cosmopolitan

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:07.370 
extremely modern very very cosmopolitan
look<00:02:03.570> to<00:02:03.810> it<00:02:05.329> you<00:02:06.329> can<00:02:06.509> see<00:02:06.750> that<00:02:06.780> there's<00:02:07.170> no

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
look to it you can see that there's no

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:11.869 
look to it you can see that there's no
rear<00:02:08.009> bumper<00:02:08.489> on<00:02:08.670> on<00:02:08.940> the<00:02:09.629> vehicle<00:02:10.140> at<00:02:10.379> all<00:02:10.879> and

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879 
rear bumper on on the vehicle at all and

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:13.230 
rear bumper on on the vehicle at all and
if<00:02:12.030> you<00:02:12.150> notice<00:02:12.569> that

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.240 
if you notice that

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:15.420 
if you notice that
tailgate<00:02:13.840> sheet<00:02:14.200> metal<00:02:14.560> is<00:02:14.650> actually<00:02:14.800> flushed

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430 
tailgate sheet metal is actually flushed

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:17.940 
tailgate sheet metal is actually flushed
to<00:02:15.640> that<00:02:15.820> to<00:02:16.300> that<00:02:16.330> bum<00:02:16.870> perlis<00:02:17.230> rear-end<00:02:17.740> and

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 
to that to that bum perlis rear-end and

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:20.100 
to that to that bum perlis rear-end and
look<00:02:18.340> at<00:02:18.460> how<00:02:18.550> clean<00:02:18.910> and<00:02:19.120> smooth<00:02:19.510> that<00:02:19.840> makes

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:20.110 
look at how clean and smooth that makes

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:22.170 
look at how clean and smooth that makes
that<00:02:20.320> whole<00:02:20.560> surface<00:02:21.100> now<00:02:21.550> we<00:02:21.610> were<00:02:21.850> able<00:02:22.000> to

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180 
that whole surface now we were able to

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:25.770 
that whole surface now we were able to
achieve<00:02:22.390> that<00:02:22.930> by<00:02:23.500> using<00:02:24.220> magnesium<00:02:24.910> on<00:02:25.450> the

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780 
achieve that by using magnesium on the

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:28.140 
achieve that by using magnesium on the
on<00:02:25.990> as<00:02:26.410> the<00:02:26.770> substructure<00:02:27.280> for<00:02:27.760> the<00:02:27.910> tailgate

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.150 
on as the substructure for the tailgate

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:31.050 
on as the substructure for the tailgate
it's<00:02:28.600> lighter<00:02:28.960> and<00:02:29.260> stronger<00:02:30.040> and<00:02:30.460> then<00:02:30.850> what

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060 
it's lighter and stronger and then what

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:33.780 
it's lighter and stronger and then what
we<00:02:31.210> have<00:02:31.480> across<00:02:31.840> here<00:02:32.170> is<00:02:32.200> what<00:02:32.470> we<00:02:32.590> on<00:02:33.550> the

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 
we have across here is what we on the

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:36.540 
we have across here is what we on the
surface<00:02:34.240> is<00:02:34.420> what<00:02:34.840> call<00:02:35.080> a<00:02:35.380> sacrifice<00:02:36.010> panel

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:36.550 
surface is what call a sacrifice panel

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:38.850 
surface is what call a sacrifice panel
because<00:02:37.150> it's<00:02:37.360> made<00:02:37.600> out<00:02:37.750> of<00:02:37.780> soft<00:02:38.110> material

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:38.860 
because it's made out of soft material

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:40.920 
because it's made out of soft material
so<00:02:39.250> this<00:02:39.580> will<00:02:39.760> actually<00:02:39.940> take<00:02:40.210> a<00:02:40.450> hit

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
so this will actually take a hit

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:43.170 
so this will actually take a hit
just<00:02:41.290> like<00:02:41.470> the<00:02:41.650> bumper<00:02:42.010> that's<00:02:42.340> why<00:02:42.700> we

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180 
just like the bumper that's why we

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:44.940 
just like the bumper that's why we
weren't<00:02:43.390> we<00:02:43.930> didn't<00:02:44.170> have<00:02:44.260> to<00:02:44.410> set<00:02:44.650> the

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950 
weren't we didn't have to set the

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:47.340 
weren't we didn't have to set the
tailgate<00:02:45.880> further<00:02:46.390> forward<00:02:46.900> and<00:02:47.020> have<00:02:47.200> an

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:47.350 
tailgate further forward and have an

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:50.670 
tailgate further forward and have an
offset<00:02:47.770> to<00:02:48.310> to<00:02:49.000> the<00:02:49.120> bumper<00:02:49.450> and<00:02:49.630> you<00:02:50.290> can<00:02:50.470> see

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:50.680 
offset to to the bumper and you can see

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:53.640 
offset to to the bumper and you can see
those<00:02:51.070> between<00:02:51.790> the<00:02:51.910> magnesium<00:02:52.690> and<00:02:52.870> and<00:02:53.470> the

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:53.650 
those between the magnesium and and the

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:55.590 
those between the magnesium and and the
sacrifice<00:02:54.250> panel<00:02:54.670> that<00:02:54.970> allowed<00:02:55.270> us<00:02:55.300> to<00:02:55.480> have

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:55.600 
sacrifice panel that allowed us to have

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:58.520 
sacrifice panel that allowed us to have
this<00:02:55.840> beautiful<00:02:56.440> beautiful<00:02:56.710> clean<00:02:57.220> design
