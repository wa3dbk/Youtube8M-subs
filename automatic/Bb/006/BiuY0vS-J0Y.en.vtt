00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.850
 hello how am I a chef air and the day of 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:05.720
 Today I am going to teach you how to make a 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:05.720
 double jelly 

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:12.980
 that the center goes with water jelly and 

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:14.570
 fruits and outside a milk jelly 

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:16.730
 has a very good view for some 

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:18.380
 occasion especially I am doing the 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:20.420
 easier recipe that is using 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:22.130
 gelatins to spare but you 

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:24.439
 can do with natural jellies 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:26.240
 using fruit pulps and tubs 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:27.590
 remember that you are the ones in 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:29.930
 your house and can do the combinations 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:32.270
 that you want this is only a 

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:34.040
 example of this jelly then they can 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:35.840
 prepare them with water gelatins 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:37.640
 different flavors as in the 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:39.830
 part of outside milk gelatins 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:41.809
 different flavors and colors so 

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:44.030
 you prepare the way you want 

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:45.920
 with the flavors that you want this 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:47.510
 is a quick video express you 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:49.190
 they want to leave it like this or decorate them 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:51.290
 his taste even to put a little 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:52.820
 whipped cream and fruits will look great 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:54.920
 I'm going to send you special greetings 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:57.830
 for carla bobadilla of the district 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:59.930
 federal for marta arriola garcia and for 

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:01.070
 the ex of the lyon who sees us from yuta a 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:02.960
 greeting you three who were 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:05.330
 always aware of what happened with 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:07.340
 the camera on the bottom I leave 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:09.740
 the links so they need in the taste 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:11.450
 of Roger on Facebook and remember that if 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:13.910
 they liked the video like it commented 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:15.260
 share and subscribe to the channel so 

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:17.900
 soon I am beginning with 

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:19.820
 the chao jelly we are going to make a 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:22.510
 water jelly in the way that the 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:25.370
 that you do, let's put to boil 

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:28.100
 900 milliliters of water me regularly 

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:30.730
 the water so I feel that dissolves a 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:30.730
 a little better 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:41.430
 we will let it cool and meanwhile 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:43.980
 we will chop the fruits that we go to 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:46.200
 want them to be in now I'm going to 

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:48.450
 clean a few photos again 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:51.450
 all these are some I'm going to get 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:54.000
 of strawberries pineapple slices a mango 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:56.700
 and green ball or fresh alabaster be 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.280
 nothing else for the fruit to feel 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:03.320
 when i 'm latina 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.320
 it's the same as pineapple 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:10.380
 we go 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:21.330
 it's good we take out our mango 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:30.930
 and we tested it 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:35.430
 we preserve 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:59.530
 and with pieces and everything is ready and that 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:02.950
 cool it's not water jello I'm going to 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:05.650
 add in another mold which has to 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:08.380
 be smaller than where I'm going to finish my 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:10.360
 gelatin I'm going to put it in the middle 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:12.970
 only since I'm going to fill it 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:15.560
 fruits and now I'm going to add all 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:20.020
 our fruit 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:20.020
 to our Chinese city 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:26.560
 mix very well to stir 

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:29.790
 all the products and so we are going to 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:33.190
 refrigerate this jelly until it set 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:34.959
 and now I'm going to prepare a jelly 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:37.840
 milk the flavors of both that you have 

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:39.610
 They can be independent or combine 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:42.190
 this time I'm going to use a jelly 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:44.110
 of strawberry water and one of milk of track 

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:46.060
 we will do likewise as you 

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:48.459
 do your Latinas I'm going to put 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:50.799
 boil 900 milliliters of milk since it is 

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:53.830
 boiling our milk we turn off and 

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:56.319
 we add our gelatin mix very 

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:58.330
 ok and now if we are going to let this 

00:03:56.319 --> 00:04:00.970
 Gelatin is cooled to temperature 

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:02.950
 environment and meanwhile our other 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:05.079
 gelatin is going to curdle this is going to be 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:07.450
 our mold that we are going to use for 

00:04:05.079 --> 00:04:10.180
 do our creative I'm going to give you a 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:11.890
 small trick to demold more 

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:14.530
 easily your gelatin is not 

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:16.930
 indispensable but it will help them 

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:20.440
 quite more when where they are going to 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:22.389
 prepare have many figurines made 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:25.300
 this is the cover of a cake is not a 

00:04:22.389 --> 00:04:28.509
 mold but it will work 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:34.590
 I will have a great time so above all 

00:04:28.509 --> 00:04:34.590
 on the shores where you have little figures 

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:42.510
 for what we will do is put a little 

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:45.180
 of gelatin and it's cold at the base and 

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:47.370
 we're going to let it set because when 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:49.800
 let's put our Latin costume on us 

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:52.500
 lower by the weight of the fruits so 

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:55.110
 refrigera moss and we take this base well 

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:57.510
 of gelatine and thus rennet our base of 

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:59.790
 our gelatin has also curdled 

00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:01.860
 our other jelly and we're going to 

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:05.670
 unmold now yes what we will do will be 

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:09.240
 put our gelatin at the center of the 

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:11.400
 another and our other gelatin our 

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:15.270
 another part of the gelatine was already due 

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:18.410
 have cooled down let's put and it's 

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:21.000
 ready now we are going to refrigerate 

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:24.000
 we let it set and we'll see how we 

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:26.820
 our gelatine has already set 

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:29.130
 can see is already solid is relative 

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:31.680
 have figurines or design we are going to 

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:34.290
 take off gently and with the small 

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:37.620
 smeared with oil that we gave ourselves 

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:39.740
 is going to take off this without any problem 

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:43.370
 we take off everything 

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:46.039
 we are going to disassemble this gelatin we are going to 

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:48.590
 put our mold and remember a 

00:05:46.039 --> 00:05:51.740
 fast movement we will mount so that 

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:54.830
 fall on your bus so at one o'clock 

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:57.949
 two and all three here is our 

00:05:54.830 --> 00:06:00.500
 Unmold gelatine as you will see outside 

00:05:57.949 --> 00:06:03.139
 it looks like a simple milk jelly and it 's 

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:04.910
 you like you can decorate 

00:06:03.139 --> 00:06:06.020
 This is I have that this is the way 

00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:08.720
 plane that can be made of 

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:11.599
 any kind of flavors and now we're going 

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:16.060
 to see how it looks inside observe 

00:06:11.599 --> 00:06:16.060
 how our jelly has stayed 

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:22.360
 Y 

00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:30.960
 the one of fruits below the right above and 

00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:30.960
 It looks very special 

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:39.680
 you will win and that is all we see to the 

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:39.680
 next
