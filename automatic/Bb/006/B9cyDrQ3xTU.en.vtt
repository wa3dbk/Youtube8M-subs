so<00:00:01.199> iseman<00:00:01.709> asked<00:00:01.979> me<00:00:02.070> if<00:00:02.159> I<00:00:02.310> would<00:00:02.909> it's

00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:03.179 
so iseman asked me if I would it's

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:04.849 
so iseman asked me if I would it's
iseman<00:00:03.600> asked<00:00:03.780> me<00:00:03.870> if<00:00:03.929> I<00:00:04.049> would<00:00:04.200> you<00:00:04.740> know

iseman asked me if I would you know

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:07.760 
iseman asked me if I would you know
pulled<00:00:05.100> up<00:00:05.310> pulled<00:00:05.879> up<00:00:06.060> the<00:00:06.990> probe<00:00:07.230> apart<00:00:07.560> here

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:07.770 
pulled up pulled up the probe apart here

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:10.100 
pulled up pulled up the probe apart here
and<00:00:07.980> you<00:00:08.550> can<00:00:08.670> see<00:00:08.790> I<00:00:08.820> got<00:00:09.059> the<00:00:09.300> got<00:00:09.750> the<00:00:09.780> wire

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.110 
and you can see I got the got the wire

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:11.540 
and you can see I got the got the wire
you<00:00:10.469> know<00:00:10.559> disconnected<00:00:11.099> out<00:00:11.190> of<00:00:11.250> the<00:00:11.309> clamp

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550 
you know disconnected out of the clamp

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:13.640 
you know disconnected out of the clamp
probe<00:00:11.849> I<00:00:11.940> just<00:00:12.120> have<00:00:12.269> the<00:00:12.450> clamp<00:00:13.200> probe<00:00:13.440> just

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
probe I just have the clamp probe just

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:15.560 
probe I just have the clamp probe just
here<00:00:13.769> to<00:00:13.860> take<00:00:13.980> the<00:00:14.130> weight<00:00:14.309> off<00:00:14.340> of<00:00:14.670> it<00:00:14.790> ran<00:00:15.420> it

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
here to take the weight off of it ran it

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.180 
here to take the weight off of it ran it
underneath<00:00:15.750> some<00:00:15.990> flip<00:00:16.470> tied<00:00:16.650> it<00:00:16.800> to<00:00:16.890> the<00:00:16.980> line

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
underneath some flip tied it to the line

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:18.769 
underneath some flip tied it to the line
I<00:00:17.609> have<00:00:17.910> it<00:00:18.029> foil<00:00:18.330> tape

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
I have it foil tape

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:20.660 
I have it foil tape
I<00:00:18.810> have<00:00:19.050> it<00:00:19.170> wrapped<00:00:19.740> with<00:00:19.949> foam<00:00:20.160> that<00:00:20.460> I<00:00:20.490> have

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
I have it wrapped with foam that I have

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.320 
I have it wrapped with foam that I have
some<00:00:20.820> foil<00:00:21.029> tape<00:00:21.240> so<00:00:21.480> we're<00:00:22.080> keeping<00:00:22.230> away<00:00:22.890> the

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:23.330 
some foil tape so we're keeping away the

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:26.570 
some foil tape so we're keeping away the
you<00:00:24.330> know<00:00:24.449> the<00:00:24.570> heat<00:00:25.470> by<00:00:25.680> conductivity<00:00:26.369> and

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
you know the heat by conductivity and

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.570 
you know the heat by conductivity and
also<00:00:27.060> the<00:00:27.300> thermal<00:00:27.570> radiation<00:00:27.840> you<00:00:28.410> know<00:00:28.580> just

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
also the thermal radiation you know just

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.220 
also the thermal radiation you know just
because<00:00:29.820> it's<00:00:29.939> reflective<00:00:30.480> and<00:00:30.960> I<00:00:31.050> want<00:00:31.170> to

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
because it's reflective and I want to

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:32.900 
because it's reflective and I want to
see<00:00:31.349> how<00:00:31.560> close<00:00:31.590> the<00:00:32.130> thermistor<00:00:32.430> matched

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
see how close the thermistor matched

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.200 
see how close the thermistor matched
with<00:00:33.239> the<00:00:33.590> nebera<00:00:34.590> thermistor<00:00:34.950> matched<00:00:35.880> with

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
with the nebera thermistor matched with

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.330 
with the nebera thermistor matched with
the<00:00:36.420> with<00:00:37.200> the<00:00:37.320> saturation<00:00:37.950> temperature<00:00:38.070> the

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
the with the saturation temperature the

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.760 
the with the saturation temperature the
refrigerant<00:00:38.879> and<00:00:39.110> you<00:00:40.110> know<00:00:40.200> how<00:00:40.290> accurate

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
refrigerant and you know how accurate

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.290 
refrigerant and you know how accurate
this<00:00:40.920> gauge<00:00:41.160> really<00:00:41.520> really<00:00:41.910> is<00:00:42.059> and<00:00:42.210> then

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
this gauge really really is and then

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.030 
this gauge really really is and then
sort<00:00:42.480> of<00:00:42.629> get<00:00:42.780> an<00:00:42.840> idea<00:00:42.930> what<00:00:43.350> the<00:00:43.440> impact<00:00:43.860> is

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
sort of get an idea what the impact is

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.520 
sort of get an idea what the impact is
of<00:00:44.100> using<00:00:44.760> a<00:00:44.850> temperature<00:00:45.239> clamp<00:00:45.480> bro<00:00:45.750> so<00:00:46.440> if

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
of using a temperature clamp bro so if

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.880 
of using a temperature clamp bro so if
you<00:00:46.620> look<00:00:46.829> over<00:00:47.100> here<00:00:48.289> and<00:00:49.289> I'm<00:00:49.469> gonna<00:00:49.590> put<00:00:49.800> it

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
you look over here and I'm gonna put it

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.229 
you look over here and I'm gonna put it
on<00:00:49.920> the<00:00:50.039> back<00:00:50.250> right<00:00:50.489> here<00:00:50.700> just<00:00:50.879> to<00:00:50.969> make<00:00:51.120> this

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
on the back right here just to make this

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.090 
on the back right here just to make this
a<00:00:51.300> little<00:00:51.510> brighter<00:00:51.780> and<00:00:52.079> refocus<00:00:52.949> the<00:00:53.070> camera

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
a little brighter and refocus the camera

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.029 
a little brighter and refocus the camera
and<00:00:53.789> you<00:00:54.239> see<00:00:54.300> evey<00:00:54.989> right<00:00:55.590> here<00:00:55.829> is

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
and you see evey right here is

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:57.889 
and you see evey right here is
evaporator<00:00:56.699> temperature<00:00:57.480> so<00:00:57.600> that's<00:00:57.750> the

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
evaporator temperature so that's the

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.290 
evaporator temperature so that's the
saturation<00:00:58.590> temperature<00:00:58.739> refrigerant<00:00:59.579> I<00:00:59.879> hit

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
saturation temperature refrigerant I hit

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.540 
saturation temperature refrigerant I hit
the<00:01:00.420> down<00:01:00.660> arrow<00:01:00.690> t1<00:01:01.620> that's<00:01:02.010> the<00:01:02.340> measure

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
the down arrow t1 that's the measure

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:08.390 
the down arrow t1 that's the measure
temp<00:01:02.850> so<00:01:03.030> 39<00:01:03.480> six<00:01:03.840> back<00:01:04.619> up<00:01:04.860> 39<00:01:05.369> 739<00:01:06.299> 639<00:01:07.400> 739

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
temp so 39 six back up 39 739 639 739

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:15.170 
temp so 39 six back up 39 739 639 739
six<00:01:09.799> pretty<00:01:10.799> stable<00:01:11.390> 39<00:01:12.390> six<00:01:13.820> so<00:01:14.820> these<00:01:15.030> are

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
six pretty stable 39 six so these are

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.179 
six pretty stable 39 six so these are
literally<00:01:15.630> within<00:01:16.020> a<00:01:16.229> tenth<00:01:16.530> of<00:01:16.680> a<00:01:16.770> degree<00:01:16.890> of

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
literally within a tenth of a degree of

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:20.330 
literally within a tenth of a degree of
each<00:01:17.340> other<00:01:17.580> right<00:01:17.880> almost<00:01:18.420> dead<00:01:19.189> it's<00:01:20.189> dead

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
each other right almost dead it's dead

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:21.830 
each other right almost dead it's dead
perfect<00:01:20.820> you<00:01:21.000> can't<00:01:21.210> get<00:01:21.330> any<00:01:21.479> closer<00:01:21.689> than

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
perfect you can't get any closer than

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.710 
perfect you can't get any closer than
this<00:01:21.990> I<00:01:22.380> mean<00:01:22.740> it's<00:01:22.920> literally<00:01:23.159> 39<00:01:23.670> 630<00:01:24.119> 97<00:01:24.659> you

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
this I mean it's literally 39 630 97 you

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.630 
this I mean it's literally 39 630 97 you
gotta<00:01:24.869> remember<00:01:24.990> this<00:01:25.229> is<00:01:25.350> a<00:01:25.640> tempter

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
gotta remember this is a tempter

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.429 
gotta remember this is a tempter
pressure<00:01:26.880> relationship<00:01:27.570> so<00:01:27.780> you<00:01:27.990> know<00:01:28.080> tiny

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
pressure relationship so you know tiny

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.560 
pressure relationship so you know tiny
tiny<00:01:28.770> changes<00:01:29.189> in<00:01:29.250> pressure<00:01:29.549> we're<00:01:30.299> seeing

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
tiny changes in pressure we're seeing

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.270 
tiny changes in pressure we're seeing
those<00:01:30.689> tiny<00:01:30.930> changes<00:01:31.409> in<00:01:31.470> saturation

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
those tiny changes in saturation

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.859 
those tiny changes in saturation
temperature<00:01:32.430> and<00:01:32.850> there's<00:01:33.360> our<00:01:33.509> measured

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
temperature and there's our measured

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.950 
temperature and there's our measured
temperature<00:01:34.320> so<00:01:34.890> this<00:01:35.130> is<00:01:35.400> true<00:01:36.000> a<00:01:36.030> picture<00:01:36.840> of

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
temperature so this is true a picture of

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.800 
temperature so this is true a picture of
saturation<00:01:37.650> as<00:01:37.740> you<00:01:37.890> can<00:01:38.070> get<00:01:38.250> and<00:01:38.640> just<00:01:39.630> goes

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
saturation as you can get and just goes

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.569 
saturation as you can get and just goes
to<00:01:39.960> show<00:01:40.140> you<00:01:40.200> how<00:01:40.439> accurate<00:01:41.070> the<00:01:41.189> digital

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
to show you how accurate the digital

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:44.929 
to show you how accurate the digital
gauge<00:01:41.759> like<00:01:42.030> the<00:01:42.270> testam<00:01:42.659> 550<00:01:43.290> really<00:01:44.280> is<00:01:44.490> so

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
gauge like the testam 550 really is so

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:48.620 
gauge like the testam 550 really is so
pretty<00:01:45.720> slick<00:01:46.729> that<00:01:47.729> chose<00:01:48.090> to<00:01:48.210> show<00:01:48.360> us<00:01:48.479> the

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
pretty slick that chose to show us the

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:49.910 
pretty slick that chose to show us the
temperature<00:01:48.840> clamp<00:01:49.259> you<00:01:49.409> know<00:01:49.530> using<00:01:49.799> that

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
temperature clamp you know using that

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.550 
temperature clamp you know using that
using<00:01:50.340> the<00:01:50.399> clamp<00:01:50.640> probe<00:01:50.970> has<00:01:51.630> an<00:01:51.899> effect<00:01:52.259> of

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
using the clamp probe has an effect of

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:57.560 
using the clamp probe has an effect of
about<00:01:53.220> a<00:01:53.250> degree<00:01:53.909> of<00:01:55.100> change<00:01:56.100> and<00:01:56.520> that's<00:01:57.329> why

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
about a degree of change and that's why

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.469 
about a degree of change and that's why
the<00:01:57.630> 570<00:01:58.469> as<00:01:58.619> that<00:01:59.340> temperature<00:02:00.240> clamp

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
the 570 as that temperature clamp

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.450 
the 570 as that temperature clamp
compensation<00:02:01.290> built<00:02:01.500> in<00:02:01.680> for<00:02:01.860> that<00:02:01.979> increased

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
compensation built in for that increased

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.899 
compensation built in for that increased
accuracy<00:02:03.290> but<00:02:04.290> I<00:02:04.560> mean<00:02:05.159> you're<00:02:05.490> talking<00:02:05.670> about

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
accuracy but I mean you're talking about

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:07.850 
accuracy but I mean you're talking about
a<00:02:06.060> degree<00:02:06.479> here<00:02:06.750> so<00:02:06.990> it's<00:02:07.200> not<00:02:07.350> quibble<00:02:07.740> over

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
a degree here so it's not quibble over

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.449 
a degree here so it's not quibble over
something<00:02:08.700> that<00:02:08.819> tiny<00:02:09.090> but<00:02:09.840> pretty<00:02:10.770> slick<00:02:11.099> how

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
something that tiny but pretty slick how

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.130 
something that tiny but pretty slick how
accurate<00:02:11.940> that<00:02:12.120> thing

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
accurate that thing

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.770 
accurate that thing
accurate<00:02:13.560> that<00:02:13.710> really<00:02:14.069> is<00:02:14.250> mean<00:02:15.090> BAM<00:02:15.450> right

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
accurate that really is mean BAM right

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.559 
accurate that really is mean BAM right
there<00:02:16.050> perfect<00:02:16.710> picture<00:02:17.670> of<00:02:17.700> saturation

00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:18.569 
there perfect picture of saturation

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:20.840 
there perfect picture of saturation
temperature<00:02:18.690> going<00:02:19.290> back<00:02:19.560> and<00:02:19.740> forth<00:02:20.010> those

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:20.850 
temperature going back and forth those

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:27.140 
temperature going back and forth those
things<00:02:21.240> are<00:02:21.560> absolutely<00:02:23.180> identical<00:02:26.150> awesome

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
things are absolutely identical awesome

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:30.860 
things are absolutely identical awesome
all<00:02:27.870> right<00:02:27.930> thanks
