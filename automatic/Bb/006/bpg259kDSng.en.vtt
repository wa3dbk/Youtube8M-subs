elevator pitch sofa tato in the
beginning<00:00:37.870> it's<00:00:37.989> an<00:00:38.079> iphone<00:00:38.230> app<00:00:38.940> that<00:00:39.940> lets

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:40.690 
beginning it's an iphone app that lets

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:42.150 
beginning it's an iphone app that lets
you<00:00:40.780> take<00:00:41.200> a<00:00:41.260> picture<00:00:41.649> of<00:00:41.680> what<00:00:41.829> you<00:00:41.950> eat<00:00:42.130> and

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:42.160 
you take a picture of what you eat and

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:45.029 
you take a picture of what you eat and
we'll<00:00:42.730> tell<00:00:43.180> you<00:00:43.210> how<00:00:43.360> fat<00:00:43.719> you'll<00:00:43.960> get<00:00:44.140> so<00:00:44.769> we

00:00:45.029 --> 00:00:45.039 
we'll tell you how fat you'll get so we

00:00:45.039 --> 00:00:46.740 
we'll tell you how fat you'll get so we
identify<00:00:45.579> your<00:00:45.760> food<00:00:46.000> we<00:00:46.300> tell<00:00:46.510> you<00:00:46.600> how<00:00:46.690> many

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:46.750 
identify your food we tell you how many

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:49.739 
identify your food we tell you how many
calories<00:00:47.250> carbs<00:00:48.250> proteins<00:00:48.850> and<00:00:49.480> let<00:00:49.629> you

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:49.749 
calories carbs proteins and let you

00:00:49.749 --> 00:00:51.689 
calories carbs proteins and let you
track<00:00:50.050> all<00:00:50.350> your<00:00:50.379> eating<00:00:50.920> and<00:00:51.070> then<00:00:51.100> we're

00:00:51.689 --> 00:00:51.699 
track all your eating and then we're

00:00:51.699 --> 00:00:54.029 
track all your eating and then we're
trying<00:00:51.730> to<00:00:52.149> make<00:00:52.329> sense<00:00:52.600> of<00:00:52.899> that<00:00:53.170> data<00:00:53.469> trying

00:00:54.029 --> 00:00:54.039 
trying to make sense of that data trying

00:00:54.039 --> 00:00:55.860 
trying to make sense of that data trying
to<00:00:54.129> find<00:00:54.370> out<00:00:54.489> how<00:00:54.640> your<00:00:54.760> body<00:00:55.030> works<00:00:55.149> what<00:00:55.690> you

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:55.870 
to find out how your body works what you

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:59.399 
to find out how your body works what you
should<00:00:55.929> eat<00:00:56.320> what<00:00:57.219> is<00:00:58.050> unnecessary<00:00:59.050> in<00:00:59.289> your

00:00:59.399 --> 00:00:59.409 
should eat what is unnecessary in your

00:00:59.409 --> 00:01:01.680 
should eat what is unnecessary in your
diet<00:00:59.649> and<00:01:00.100> make<00:01:00.460> recommendations<00:01:00.640> and<00:01:01.390> at

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:01.690 
diet and make recommendations and at

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:03.329 
diet and make recommendations and at
some<00:01:01.929> point<00:01:02.109> we'll<00:01:02.350> also<00:01:02.679> be<00:01:02.920> able<00:01:03.069> to

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:03.339 
some point we'll also be able to

00:01:03.339 --> 00:01:06.960 
some point we'll also be able to
recommend<00:01:03.640> and<00:01:03.999> do<00:01:04.960> dishes<00:01:05.290> and<00:01:05.710> meals<00:01:05.970> around

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:06.970 
recommend and do dishes and meals around

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:09.540 
recommend and do dishes and meals around
you<00:01:07.450> that<00:01:07.659> fit<00:01:07.900> to<00:01:08.080> your<00:01:08.200> diet<00:01:08.470> it<00:01:09.159> tell<00:01:09.340> us<00:01:09.460> a

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:09.550 
you that fit to your diet it tell us a

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:10.680 
you that fit to your diet it tell us a
little<00:01:09.640> bit<00:01:09.790> about<00:01:09.970> the<00:01:10.090> technology<00:01:10.360> behind

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:10.690 
little bit about the technology behind

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:12.750 
little bit about the technology behind
the<00:01:11.020> app<00:01:11.140> because<00:01:11.620> I'm<00:01:11.830> do<00:01:12.460> you<00:01:12.520> have<00:01:12.610> some

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:12.760 
the app because I'm do you have some

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:16.140 
the app because I'm do you have some
sort<00:01:12.880> of<00:01:12.970> crazy<00:01:13.240> photo<00:01:13.750> algorithm<00:01:14.910> yes<00:01:15.910> of

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:16.150 
sort of crazy photo algorithm yes of

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:20.160 
sort of crazy photo algorithm yes of
course<00:01:16.570> and<00:01:16.810> we<00:01:17.260> do<00:01:17.680> image<00:01:18.070> recognition<00:01:18.780> so<00:01:19.780> we

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:20.170 
course and we do image recognition so we

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:22.170 
course and we do image recognition so we
have<00:01:20.260> a<00:01:20.320> lot<00:01:20.440> of<00:01:20.490> image<00:01:21.490> similarity

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:22.180 
have a lot of image similarity

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:24.120 
have a lot of image similarity
algorithms<00:01:22.840> that<00:01:22.900> can<00:01:23.020> tell<00:01:23.320> okay<00:01:23.680> this<00:01:23.920> is

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:24.130 
algorithms that can tell okay this is

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:26.310 
algorithms that can tell okay this is
the<00:01:24.400> same<00:01:24.610> picture<00:01:25.030> or<00:01:25.240> the<00:01:25.420> same<00:01:25.840> dish<00:01:26.050> as

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:26.320 
the same picture or the same dish as

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:29.040 
the same picture or the same dish as
other<00:01:26.560> pictures<00:01:26.950> but<00:01:27.460> we're<00:01:27.760> what<00:01:28.060> the<00:01:28.780> big

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:29.050 
other pictures but we're what the big

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:32.160 
other pictures but we're what the big
vision<00:01:29.320> is<00:01:29.680> is<00:01:30.000> really<00:01:31.000> modeling<00:01:31.540> the<00:01:31.690> visual

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:32.170 
vision is is really modeling the visual

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:35.190 
vision is is really modeling the visual
cortex<00:01:32.350> of<00:01:32.770> humans<00:01:33.160> so<00:01:33.850> be<00:01:34.120> being<00:01:34.600> able<00:01:34.960> to

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:35.200 
cortex of humans so be being able to

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:39.650 
cortex of humans so be being able to
identify<00:01:35.710> objects<00:01:37.170> like<00:01:38.170> without<00:01:38.490> having

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:39.660 
identify objects like without having

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:45.210 
identify objects like without having
exact<00:01:41.700> pictures<00:01:42.700> of<00:01:42.940> the<00:01:43.060> object<00:01:44.020> before<00:01:44.220> Wow

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:45.220 
exact pictures of the object before Wow

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:47.160 
exact pictures of the object before Wow
kaito<00:01:45.670> talk<00:01:46.090> to<00:01:46.240> me<00:01:46.330> a<00:01:46.360> little<00:01:46.390> bit<00:01:46.570> about<00:01:46.810> how

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:47.170 
kaito talk to me a little bit about how

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:48.810 
kaito talk to me a little bit about how
the<00:01:47.230> human<00:01:47.650> does<00:01:47.830> that<00:01:48.010> first<00:01:48.310> and<00:01:48.580> how<00:01:48.670> you're

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:48.820 
the human does that first and how you're

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:49.830 
the human does that first and how you're
going<00:01:48.910> to<00:01:49.000> replicate<00:01:49.450> that<00:01:49.480> with<00:01:49.660> your

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:49.840 
going to replicate that with your

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:52.890 
going to replicate that with your
technology<00:01:50.080> yeah<00:01:50.980> so<00:01:51.670> like<00:01:52.270> the<00:01:52.480> most

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:52.900 
technology yeah so like the most

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:55.170 
technology yeah so like the most
abstract<00:01:53.440> model<00:01:54.130> is<00:01:54.370> something<00:01:55.060> called

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:55.180 
abstract model is something called

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:57.270 
abstract model is something called
neural<00:01:55.570> networks<00:01:56.020> that<00:01:56.560> was<00:01:56.710> invented<00:01:57.130> in<00:01:57.220> the

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:57.280 
neural networks that was invented in the

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:00.390 
neural networks that was invented in the
70s<00:01:57.730> but<00:01:58.300> turned<00:01:58.600> out<00:01:58.750> that<00:01:59.160> humans<00:02:00.160> don't

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:00.400 
70s but turned out that humans don't

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:02.550 
70s but turned out that humans don't
actually<00:02:00.880> work<00:02:01.030> like<00:02:01.270> that<00:02:01.300> so<00:02:02.110> we<00:02:02.260> have<00:02:02.380> a<00:02:02.410> lot

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:02.560 
actually work like that so we have a lot

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:06.180 
actually work like that so we have a lot
of<00:02:03.240> research<00:02:04.240> on<00:02:04.990> how<00:02:05.350> the<00:02:05.410> visual<00:02:05.950> cortex

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:06.190 
of research on how the visual cortex

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:09.330 
of research on how the visual cortex
only<00:02:06.760> the<00:02:07.170> image<00:02:08.170> recognition<00:02:08.379> part<00:02:08.950> of<00:02:09.190> the

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:09.340 
only the image recognition part of the

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:12.500 
only the image recognition part of the
brain<00:02:09.580> works<00:02:10.030> and<00:02:10.390> has<00:02:11.170> like<00:02:11.440> several<00:02:12.010> layers

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
brain works and has like several layers

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:15.630 
brain works and has like several layers
especially<00:02:13.510> the<00:02:14.080> one<00:02:14.379> it's<00:02:14.620> called<00:02:14.680> where<00:02:15.459> we

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640 
especially the one it's called where we

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:19.140 
especially the one it's called where we
try<00:02:15.849> to<00:02:15.910> model<00:02:16.300> that<00:02:16.560> very<00:02:17.670> close<00:02:18.670> to<00:02:19.030> the

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:19.150 
try to model that very close to the

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:20.990 
try to model that very close to the
actual<00:02:19.269> biological

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
actual biological

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.800 
actual biological
function<00:02:21.930> of<00:02:22.050> the<00:02:22.170> brain<00:02:22.350> so<00:02:23.130> it's

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:23.810 
function of the brain so it's

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:26.840 
function of the brain so it's
biologically<00:02:24.810> inspired<00:02:25.490> Nord<00:02:26.490> neural

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:26.850 
biologically inspired Nord neural

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:30.100 
biologically inspired Nord neural
networks<00:02:27.210> how<00:02:27.690> do<00:02:27.750> you<00:02:27.990> train<00:02:28.530> a<00:02:28.590> computer<00:02:29.550> to

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:30.110 
networks how do you train a computer to

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:34.210 
networks how do you train a computer to
you<00:02:31.110> know<00:02:31.260> become<00:02:31.500> biological<00:02:32.420> know<00:02:33.420> so<00:02:33.780> I

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:34.220 
you know become biological know so I

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:36.980 
you know become biological know so I
mean<00:02:35.220> you<00:02:35.370> have<00:02:35.490> different<00:02:35.730> layers<00:02:36.210> that<00:02:36.660> have

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:36.990 
mean you have different layers that have

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:39.620 
mean you have different layers that have
different<00:02:37.440> layers<00:02:37.860> of<00:02:38.100> abstraction<00:02:38.630> just

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:39.630 
different layers of abstraction just

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:42.020 
different layers of abstraction just
like<00:02:39.780> the<00:02:39.900> human<00:02:40.350> brain<00:02:40.500> lick<00:02:41.490> on<00:02:41.700> the<00:02:41.730> first

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
like the human brain lick on the first

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:44.390 
like the human brain lick on the first
layer<00:02:42.209> you<00:02:42.420> just<00:02:42.630> see<00:02:42.959> pixels<00:02:43.530> the<00:02:44.070> second

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
layer you just see pixels the second

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.430 
layer you just see pixels the second
layer<00:02:44.580> you<00:02:44.790> would<00:02:44.940> see<00:02:45.270> edges<00:02:45.780> and<00:02:46.110> on<00:02:46.290> the

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
layer you would see edges and on the

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:50.660 
layer you would see edges and on the
third<00:02:46.650> layer<00:02:46.890> you<00:02:47.190> see<00:02:47.790> shaves<00:02:48.690> and<00:02:49.220> that<00:02:50.220> gets

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
third layer you see shaves and that gets

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:52.699 
third layer you see shaves and that gets
more<00:02:51.030> abstract<00:02:51.540> and<00:02:51.750> at<00:02:52.020> some<00:02:52.200> point<00:02:52.440> you

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:52.709 
more abstract and at some point you

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:55.010 
more abstract and at some point you
identify<00:02:53.220> ok<00:02:53.459> this<00:02:53.670> is<00:02:53.850> a<00:02:53.880> table<00:02:54.390> this<00:02:54.600> is<00:02:54.810> the

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:55.020 
identify ok this is a table this is the

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:58.940 
identify ok this is a table this is the
chair<00:02:55.260> and<00:02:55.790> that<00:02:56.790> is<00:02:56.970> how<00:02:57.480> we<00:02:57.810> also<00:02:58.320> train<00:02:58.800> our

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
chair and that is how we also train our

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:01.570 
chair and that is how we also train our
system<00:02:59.340> so<00:02:59.670> we<00:02:59.700> successively<00:03:00.390> train<00:03:00.930> it<00:03:01.140> and

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:01.580 
system so we successively train it and

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:06.410 
system so we successively train it and
combine<00:03:02.580> like<00:03:03.530> different<00:03:04.530> cups<00:03:05.160> to<00:03:05.940> actually

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420 
combine like different cups to actually

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:10.610 
combine like different cups to actually
at<00:03:06.570> one<00:03:06.959> level<00:03:07.850> be<00:03:08.850> the<00:03:09.000> same<00:03:09.239> now<00:03:09.959> um<00:03:10.290> I'm

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
at one level be the same now um I'm

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:12.670 
at one level be the same now um I'm
noticed<00:03:10.980> that<00:03:11.070> Facebook<00:03:11.520> have<00:03:11.760> an<00:03:11.880> extremely

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:12.680 
noticed that Facebook have an extremely

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:15.860 
noticed that Facebook have an extremely
amazing<00:03:13.680> facial<00:03:14.459> recognition<00:03:14.790> now<00:03:15.300> I<00:03:15.540> upload

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870 
amazing facial recognition now I upload

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:18.740 
amazing facial recognition now I upload
a<00:03:15.900> bunch<00:03:16.080> of<00:03:16.260> photos<00:03:16.470> and<00:03:17.239> sometimes<00:03:18.239> a<00:03:18.390> person

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750 
a bunch of photos and sometimes a person

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:20.660 
a bunch of photos and sometimes a person
can<00:03:18.900> be<00:03:18.989> a<00:03:19.170> completely<00:03:19.739> different<00:03:20.040> pose<00:03:20.250> a

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:20.670 
can be a completely different pose a

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:23.860 
can be a completely different pose a
mouth<00:03:21.480> open<00:03:21.989> or<00:03:22.320> like<00:03:22.530> smiling<00:03:22.950> or<00:03:23.310> frowning

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:23.870 
mouth open or like smiling or frowning

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:27.259 
mouth open or like smiling or frowning
hair-covered<00:03:24.870> and<00:03:25.290> it<00:03:25.620> still<00:03:26.030> recognizes<00:03:27.030> the

00:03:27.259 --> 00:03:27.269 
hair-covered and it still recognizes the

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:29.449 
hair-covered and it still recognizes the
face<00:03:27.450> is<00:03:27.780> that<00:03:28.470> the<00:03:28.650> same<00:03:28.799> technologies<00:03:29.370> you

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:29.459 
face is that the same technologies you

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:32.390 
face is that the same technologies you
are<00:03:29.549> using<00:03:29.730> no<00:03:30.660> not<00:03:30.959> at<00:03:31.080> all<00:03:31.170> I<00:03:31.380> mean<00:03:31.560> face

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:32.400 
are using no not at all I mean face

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:35.690 
are using no not at all I mean face
recognition<00:03:32.850> is<00:03:33.540> I<00:03:33.840> think<00:03:34.739> compared<00:03:35.459> to<00:03:35.549> that

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:35.700 
recognition is I think compared to that

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:39.020 
recognition is I think compared to that
is<00:03:36.150> a<00:03:36.180> simple<00:03:36.630> problem<00:03:36.810> and<00:03:37.459> you<00:03:38.459> just<00:03:38.640> I<00:03:38.880> mean

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.030 
is a simple problem and you just I mean

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:41.900 
is a simple problem and you just I mean
you<00:03:39.330> kind<00:03:40.110> of<00:03:40.170> know<00:03:40.380> how<00:03:40.799> face<00:03:41.130> generally

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:41.910 
you kind of know how face generally

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:45.110 
you kind of know how face generally
looks<00:03:42.120> can<00:03:42.720> calculate<00:03:43.410> a<00:03:43.590> 3d<00:03:44.040> model<00:03:44.250> I<00:03:44.610> mean<00:03:45.030> an

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:45.120 
looks can calculate a 3d model I mean an

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.000 
looks can calculate a 3d model I mean an
avocado<00:03:45.540> looks<00:03:45.810> like<00:03:45.930> an<00:03:46.049> avocado<00:03:46.140> doesn't

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:47.010 
avocado looks like an avocado doesn't

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:50.509 
avocado looks like an avocado doesn't
look<00:03:47.070> like<00:03:47.130> a<00:03:47.250> banana<00:03:47.810> okay<00:03:48.810> but<00:03:48.870> maybe<00:03:49.280> if<00:03:50.280> you

00:03:50.509 --> 00:03:50.519 
look like a banana okay but maybe if you

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:53.150 
look like a banana okay but maybe if you
have<00:03:50.670> I<00:03:50.970> don't<00:03:51.660> know<00:03:51.840> spaghetti<00:03:52.380> or<00:03:52.560> snow<00:03:52.799> and

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:53.160 
have I don't know spaghetti or snow and

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:56.270 
have I don't know spaghetti or snow and
not<00:03:53.970> all<00:03:54.329> food<00:03:55.140> look<00:03:55.590> the<00:03:55.709> same<00:03:55.920> right<00:03:56.160> you

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:56.280 
not all food look the same right you

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:57.740 
not all food look the same right you
have<00:03:56.400> so<00:03:56.610> many<00:03:56.730> different<00:03:57.030> foods<00:03:57.360> but<00:03:57.480> every

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:57.750 
have so many different foods but every

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:00.650 
have so many different foods but every
food<00:03:58.049> every<00:03:58.560> face<00:03:59.100> has<00:03:59.730> two<00:03:59.940> eyes<00:04:00.150> and<00:04:00.480> nose

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:00.660 
food every face has two eyes and nose

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:05.150 
food every face has two eyes and nose
mouth<00:04:01.440> and<00:04:02.540> yeah<00:04:03.540> you<00:04:03.810> can<00:04:03.840> kind<00:04:04.650> of<00:04:04.680> calculate

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:05.160 
mouth and yeah you can kind of calculate

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:07.610 
mouth and yeah you can kind of calculate
from<00:04:05.280> the<00:04:05.430> shades<00:04:05.930> everything<00:04:06.930> you<00:04:07.440> don't

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:07.620 
from the shades everything you don't

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:10.039 
from the shades everything you don't
have<00:04:07.769> to<00:04:07.920> actually<00:04:08.180> to<00:04:09.180> artificial

00:04:10.039 --> 00:04:10.049 
have to actually to artificial

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:13.940 
have to actually to artificial
intelligence<00:04:10.739> to<00:04:11.630> calculate<00:04:12.630> your<00:04:13.470> face

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:13.950 
intelligence to calculate your face

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:15.740 
intelligence to calculate your face
structure<00:04:14.489> and<00:04:14.940> compare<00:04:15.540> it<00:04:15.630> to<00:04:15.720> other

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:15.750 
structure and compare it to other

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:17.900 
structure and compare it to other
pictures<00:04:16.440> face<00:04:16.650> structures<00:04:17.160> tell<00:04:17.669> us<00:04:17.790> a

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:17.910 
pictures face structures tell us a

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:19.460 
pictures face structures tell us a
little<00:04:18.000> bit<00:04:18.120> about<00:04:18.359> how<00:04:19.079> you<00:04:19.109> got<00:04:19.290> to<00:04:19.350> where

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:19.470 
little bit about how you got to where

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:20.840 
little bit about how you got to where
you<00:04:19.590> are<00:04:19.680> today<00:04:19.769> because<00:04:20.280> you<00:04:20.489> said<00:04:20.669> you<00:04:20.760> were

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:20.850 
you are today because you said you were

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:23.000 
you are today because you said you were
four<00:04:21.060> or<00:04:21.180> five<00:04:21.329> people<00:04:21.570> now<00:04:21.870> when<00:04:22.590> I<00:04:22.620> met<00:04:22.680> you<00:04:22.860> a

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:23.010 
four or five people now when I met you a

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:25.040 
four or five people now when I met you a
couple<00:04:23.190> of<00:04:23.550> months<00:04:24.210> ago<00:04:24.270> you<00:04:24.780> were<00:04:24.840> just

working<00:04:51.340> on<00:04:51.400> the<00:04:51.520> prototype<00:04:51.760> and<00:04:52.530> getting

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:53.530 
working on the prototype and getting

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:56.210 
working on the prototype and getting
people<00:04:53.650> excited<00:04:53.890> about<00:04:54.280> the<00:04:54.520> technology<00:04:54.820> and

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:56.220 
people excited about the technology and

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:58.410 
people excited about the technology and
apparently<00:04:57.220> there<00:04:57.880> are<00:04:57.910> some<00:04:58.060> good<00:04:58.090> people

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:01.240 
who want to work on big problems and

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:03.870 
who want to work on big problems and
that's<00:05:01.810> how<00:05:02.020> I<00:05:02.050> found<00:05:02.290> those<00:05:02.830> people<00:05:03.160> and<00:05:03.760> now

do more than just this app or is this

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:27.240 
do more than just this app or is this
app<00:05:24.790> just<00:05:25.120> your<00:05:25.270> main<00:05:25.420> product<00:05:26.040> so<00:05:27.040> this<00:05:27.220> is

app just your main product so this is
only<00:05:27.520> a<00:05:28.030> way<00:05:28.570> to<00:05:28.630> actually<00:05:29.440> find<00:05:29.860> out<00:05:30.040> how<00:05:30.520> your

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:30.640 
only a way to actually find out how your

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:33.090 
only a way to actually find out how your
body<00:05:30.850> works<00:05:30.970> so<00:05:31.420> we<00:05:31.570> want<00:05:32.380> to<00:05:32.470> integrate<00:05:32.740> with

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:33.100 
body works so we want to integrate with

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:35.820 
body works so we want to integrate with
a<00:05:33.280> lot<00:05:33.490> of<00:05:33.610> data<00:05:34.420> from<00:05:34.810> other<00:05:35.050> startups<00:05:35.680> like

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:35.830 
a lot of data from other startups like

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:38.370 
a lot of data from other startups like
fitness<00:05:36.580> tracking<00:05:36.850> startups<00:05:37.480> or<00:05:37.780> health

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:38.380 
fitness tracking startups or health

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:42.780 
fitness tracking startups or health
startups<00:05:38.980> to<00:05:39.960> ya<00:05:40.960> be<00:05:41.290> able<00:05:41.560> to<00:05:41.650> find<00:05:41.890> out<00:05:42.100> how

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:42.790 
startups to ya be able to find out how

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:46.260 
startups to ya be able to find out how
your<00:05:43.000> body<00:05:43.390> works<00:05:43.510> and<00:05:44.080> I<00:05:44.560> think<00:05:45.310> we<00:05:46.150> will

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:46.270 
your body works and I think we will

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:50.100 
your body works and I think we will
start<00:05:46.600> out<00:05:46.840> with<00:05:47.440> our<00:05:48.390> first<00:05:49.390> target<00:05:49.600> group<00:05:49.900> is

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:50.110 
start out with our first target group is

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:52.530 
start out with our first target group is
those<00:05:50.920> quantified<00:05:51.430> self<00:05:51.670> people<00:05:52.030> who<00:05:52.150> track

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:52.540 
those quantified self people who track

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:55.170 
those quantified self people who track
everything<00:05:52.870> who<00:05:53.560> will<00:05:53.740> actually<00:05:54.310> give<00:05:55.060> us

00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:55.180 
everything who will actually give us

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:57.540 
everything who will actually give us
feedback<00:05:55.390> and<00:05:55.900> correct<00:05:56.290> our<00:05:56.830> system<00:05:57.370> and

00:05:57.540 --> 00:05:57.550 
feedback and correct our system and

00:05:57.550 --> 00:05:59.880 
feedback and correct our system and
that's<00:05:58.270> how<00:05:58.420> our<00:05:58.540> system<00:05:58.720> will<00:05:58.960> learn<00:05:59.200> but

00:05:59.880 --> 00:05:59.890 
that's how our system will learn but

00:05:59.890 --> 00:06:04.620 
that's how our system will learn but
yeah<00:06:00.220> I<00:06:00.430> agree<00:06:00.670> health<00:06:01.330> and<00:06:01.720> food<00:06:02.350> is<00:06:02.650> a<00:06:03.630> big

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:04.630 
yeah I agree health and food is a big

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:07.740 
yeah I agree health and food is a big
topic<00:06:04.960> at<00:06:05.410> the<00:06:05.500> moment<00:06:05.860> and<00:06:06.270> but<00:06:07.270> tracking

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:07.750 
topic at the moment and but tracking

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:10.470 
topic at the moment and but tracking
food<00:06:08.080> is<00:06:08.290> very<00:06:08.770> hard<00:06:09.130> so<00:06:09.790> we<00:06:09.970> want<00:06:10.150> to<00:06:10.180> make<00:06:10.300> it

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:10.480 
food is very hard so we want to make it

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:13.290 
food is very hard so we want to make it
available<00:06:11.170> to<00:06:11.470> the<00:06:11.650> masses<00:06:11.800> and<00:06:12.250> make<00:06:12.970> it<00:06:13.120> easy

groupon clone or the clone what are you
going<00:06:17.350> to<00:06:17.410> stop<00:06:17.710> to<00:06:18.150> what<00:06:19.150> are<00:06:19.240> you<00:06:19.450> going<00:06:19.570> to

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:19.630 
going to stop to what are you going to

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:21.120 
going to stop to what are you going to
prevent<00:06:19.810> other<00:06:20.140> people<00:06:20.230> from<00:06:20.500> copying<00:06:21.010> your

prevent other people from copying your
idea<00:06:22.140> they<00:06:23.140> can<00:06:23.290> try<00:06:23.470> but<00:06:24.040> I<00:06:24.760> like<00:06:25.150> that<00:06:25.300> they

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:26.050 
idea they can try but I like that they

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:29.310 
idea they can try but I like that they
can<00:06:26.200> try<00:06:26.470> I<00:06:26.890> don't<00:06:27.580> think<00:06:27.870> they<00:06:28.870> will<00:06:28.990> be<00:06:29.110> able

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:29.320 
can try I don't think they will be able

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:31.320 
can try I don't think they will be able
to<00:06:29.500> replicate<00:06:29.920> our<00:06:30.220> technology<00:06:30.880> could<00:06:31.210> you

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:31.330 
to replicate our technology could you

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:33.720 
to replicate our technology could you
algorithm<00:06:31.810> is<00:06:31.900> a<00:06:31.930> better<00:06:32.170> right<00:06:32.440> we<00:06:33.340> got<00:06:33.520> there

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:33.730 
algorithm is a better right we got there

00:06:33.730 --> 00:06:37.410 
algorithm is a better right we got there
you<00:06:33.910> need<00:06:34.090> yeah<00:06:34.980> it's<00:06:35.980> not<00:06:36.130> as<00:06:36.280> easy<00:06:36.310> as

00:06:37.410 --> 00:06:37.420 
you need yeah it's not as easy as

00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:40.260 
you need yeah it's not as easy as
well<00:06:37.690> cloning<00:06:38.530> groupon<00:06:38.970> really<00:06:39.970> well<00:06:40.150> thanks

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:40.270 
well cloning groupon really well thanks

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:41.580 
well cloning groupon really well thanks
