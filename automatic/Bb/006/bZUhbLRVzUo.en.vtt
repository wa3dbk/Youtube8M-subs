they're<00:00:18.900> both<00:00:19.140> headed<00:00:19.470> in<00:00:19.560> earth<00:00:19.710> now<00:00:20.310> you'll

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
they're both headed in earth now you'll

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.370 
they're both headed in earth now you'll
see<00:00:20.640> the<00:00:20.789> Sun<00:00:21.000> dive<00:00:21.180> and<00:00:21.359> comet<00:00:21.689> come<00:00:21.900> up<00:00:22.080> here

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
see the Sun dive and comet come up here

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.320 
see the Sun dive and comet come up here
that<00:00:22.619> is<00:00:22.769> the<00:00:22.890> first<00:00:23.130> earth<00:00:23.340> directed<00:00:23.850> CME

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
that is the first earth directed CME

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.509 
that is the first earth directed CME
that's<00:00:25.140> the<00:00:25.350> coronal<00:00:25.710> mass<00:00:25.859> ejection<00:00:26.340> on<00:00:26.430> the

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
that's the coronal mass ejection on the

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:28.310 
that's the coronal mass ejection on the
endless<00:00:26.849> spiral<00:00:27.090> you<00:00:27.390> just<00:00:27.599> saw<00:00:27.779> and<00:00:28.019> there

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
endless spiral you just saw and there

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.710 
endless spiral you just saw and there
goes<00:00:28.500> on<00:00:28.650> a<00:00:28.680> third<00:00:29.150> coronal<00:00:30.150> mass<00:00:30.269> ejection

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
goes on a third coronal mass ejection

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.569 
goes on a third coronal mass ejection
the<00:00:30.840> second<00:00:31.199> one<00:00:31.289> aimed<00:00:31.470> at<00:00:31.619> the<00:00:31.740> Sun<00:00:31.980> are

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
the second one aimed at the Sun are

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:35.450 
the second one aimed at the Sun are
aimed<00:00:32.880> at<00:00:33.120> the<00:00:33.270> the<00:00:33.450> earth<00:00:33.600> excuse<00:00:34.079> me<00:00:34.460> there

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
aimed at the the earth excuse me there

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.000 
aimed at the the earth excuse me there
it<00:00:35.550> is<00:00:35.579> again<00:00:35.640> one<00:00:36.120> two<00:00:36.469> that's<00:00:37.469> the<00:00:37.680> one<00:00:37.829> that

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
it is again one two that's the one that

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.000 
it is again one two that's the one that
you<00:00:38.250> see<00:00:38.430> on<00:00:38.579> the<00:00:38.610> spiral<00:00:39.590> now<00:00:40.590> those<00:00:40.739> two

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
you see on the spiral now those two

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.650 
you see on the spiral now those two
headed<00:00:41.309> at<00:00:41.399> the<00:00:41.489> earth<00:00:41.670> over<00:00:41.969> to<00:00:42.360> the<00:00:42.450> right

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
headed at the earth over to the right

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.180 
headed at the earth over to the right
aren't<00:00:43.050> being<00:00:43.200> tracked<00:00:43.530> no<00:00:43.770> this<00:00:43.950> is<00:00:44.070> the

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
aren't being tracked no this is the

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:45.709 
aren't being tracked no this is the
stereo<00:00:44.550> a<00:00:44.730> and<00:00:44.940> earth<00:00:45.059> is<00:00:45.239> over<00:00:45.450> to<00:00:45.600> the<00:00:45.629> left

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
stereo a and earth is over to the left

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.660 
stereo a and earth is over to the left
you<00:00:46.079> see<00:00:46.110> one<00:00:46.440> coronal<00:00:46.860> mass<00:00:46.980> ejection<00:00:47.010> go<00:00:47.520> out

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
you see one coronal mass ejection go out

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.729 
you see one coronal mass ejection go out
that<00:00:47.879> way<00:00:48.030> that's<00:00:48.870> the<00:00:49.140> big<00:00:49.289> one<00:00:49.320> you<00:00:49.559> see<00:00:49.710> on

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
that way that's the big one you see on

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.310 
that way that's the big one you see on
the<00:00:49.860> spiral<00:00:50.370> and<00:00:50.430> then<00:00:50.550> there's<00:00:50.700> another<00:00:50.940> one

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:51.320 
the spiral and then there's another one

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:55.010 
the spiral and then there's another one
coming<00:00:52.320> right<00:00:52.500> at<00:00:52.770> the<00:00:52.890> earth<00:00:53.750> what<00:00:54.750> to<00:00:54.899> watch

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
coming right at the earth what to watch

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:00.770 
coming right at the earth what to watch
it<00:00:55.230> again

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.619 

now<00:01:01.410> the<00:01:01.469> one<00:01:01.739> in<00:01:01.890> the<00:01:01.980> middle<00:01:02.160> is<00:01:02.430> the<00:01:03.210> one

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
now the one in the middle is the one

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.420 
now the one in the middle is the one
that<00:01:03.870> you<00:01:03.960> see<00:01:04.199> here<00:01:04.530> you<00:01:04.710> can<00:01:04.860> see<00:01:05.010> that<00:01:05.220> the

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
that you see here you can see that the

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.399 
that you see here you can see that the
two<00:01:05.640> coming<00:01:06.060> at<00:01:06.150> earth<00:01:06.270> are<00:01:06.540> not<00:01:07.080> being

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
two coming at earth are not being

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:12.800 
two coming at earth are not being
tracked<00:01:10.220> it's<00:01:11.220> very<00:01:11.400> simple<00:01:11.700> to<00:01:11.850> see<00:01:12.090> what

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
tracked it's very simple to see what

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.780 
tracked it's very simple to see what
we're<00:01:12.930> going<00:01:13.020> to<00:01:13.110> show<00:01:13.259> you<00:01:13.320> here<00:01:13.740> is<00:01:13.860> some

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
we're going to show you here is some

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.710 
we're going to show you here is some
shots<00:01:15.630> from<00:01:15.840> the<00:01:15.900> ghost<00:01:16.229> in<00:01:16.530> the<00:01:16.770> sdo<00:01:17.600> you<00:01:18.600> can

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
shots from the ghost in the sdo you can

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.180 
shots from the ghost in the sdo you can
check<00:01:18.899> the<00:01:19.020> time<00:01:19.229> stamp<00:01:19.259> down<00:01:19.710> at<00:01:19.890> the<00:01:19.979> bottom

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:20.190 
check the time stamp down at the bottom

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:24.139 
check the time stamp down at the bottom
and<00:01:21.350> you<00:01:22.350> can<00:01:22.500> even<00:01:22.619> see<00:01:22.950> a<00:01:23.460> little<00:01:23.729> bit<00:01:23.909> that

00:01:24.139 --> 00:01:24.149 
and you can even see a little bit that

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:26.300 
and you can even see a little bit that
you<00:01:24.810> can't<00:01:24.990> usually<00:01:25.140> see<00:01:25.470> ejections<00:01:25.979> on<00:01:26.130> that

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
you can't usually see ejections on that

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:27.469 
you can't usually see ejections on that
but<00:01:26.430> you<00:01:26.520> kind<00:01:26.700> of<00:01:26.759> can<00:01:26.970> there<00:01:27.240> and<00:01:27.420> you

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
but you kind of can there and you

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:31.460 
but you kind of can there and you
definitely<00:01:27.750> can<00:01:28.290> hear<00:01:28.560> in<00:01:28.649> the<00:01:28.740> sto<00:01:30.259> this<00:01:31.259> is

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
definitely can hear in the sto this is

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.730 
definitely can hear in the sto this is
the<00:01:31.590> first<00:01:31.890> one<00:01:32.159> mind<00:01:32.460> you<00:01:32.670> this<00:01:33.270> is<00:01:33.330> before

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:33.740 
the first one mind you this is before

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:37.969 
the first one mind you this is before
and<00:01:34.740> then<00:01:34.860> here<00:01:35.130> we<00:01:35.160> go<00:01:35.399> this<00:01:35.640> is<00:01:36.860> all<00:01:37.860> right

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
and then here we go this is all right

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:39.770 
and then here we go this is all right
that<00:01:38.220> little<00:01:38.520> wave<00:01:38.700> back<00:01:39.000> there<00:01:39.270> on<00:01:39.390> the<00:01:39.509> left

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
that little wave back there on the left

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.740 
that little wave back there on the left
was<00:01:40.229> the<00:01:40.700> CMA<00:01:41.700> that<00:01:41.880> came<00:01:42.090> from<00:01:42.450> when<00:01:42.659> the

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
was the CMA that came from when the

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.499 
was the CMA that came from when the
comet<00:01:42.990> hit<00:01:43.289> and<00:01:43.470> that<00:01:44.070> one<00:01:44.280> right<00:01:44.490> there<00:01:44.820> was

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
comet hit and that one right there was

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.649 
comet hit and that one right there was
the<00:01:45.750> last<00:01:45.929> one<00:01:46.170> we<00:01:46.289> saw<00:01:46.319> headed<00:01:46.920> at<00:01:47.009> Earth

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:47.659 
the last one we saw headed at Earth
