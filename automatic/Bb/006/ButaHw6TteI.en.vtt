00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:16.969

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:16.969

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:33.850

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:34.840
 Apart from that, we all need it when we are 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:36.940
 are out and about 

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:38.680
 because all of us are like that 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:41.879
 people spend when we are outside 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:48.780
 are or are traveling most of the time 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:48.780
 here on the feast 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:00.010
 and that's where you should not save 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:01.659
 I also had to pay some money 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:03.129
 with different schools and am on 

00:01:01.659 --> 00:01:05.620
 landed on a trekking boot 

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:07.090
 and i can do it any beginner or even 

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:08.320

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:19.090
 already in more or less comfortable way 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:21.580
 pretty much always there were always limits 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:23.560
 the one was not really for mud 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:25.150
 and better suited to sneakers 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:26.950
 example even if a bit higher 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:29.170
 was the army boots I have me as 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:30.909
 the working shoes run 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:32.560
 we were the waterproof still comfortable there 

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:35.170
 i'm all in the ass for a ass 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:36.070
 thanked in the specialty shop and at the 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:38.829
 I have to say that was the sport 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:41.380
 pretty times so on the edge for the out 

00:01:38.829 --> 00:01:43.840
 the acl my child come sport 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:48.070
 had a very useful school department 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:49.929
 he is in loveless there I have too 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:51.310
 I would try on some shoes 

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:53.109
 recommend to anyone to do 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:54.880
 advise tastes different shoes 

00:01:53.109 --> 00:01:56.590
 request these shoes 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:58.509
 As a rule, one can also follow suit 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:00.820
 Take home and wear for a few hours 

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:04.320
 to look around and is really good and 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:07.710
 what the ultimate schufa for me 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:09.780
 Of course, the same will show soon or 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:12.420
 In other words, I almost had that 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.890
 bought school had cost around 120 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.840
 he was already super comfortable at hardly 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.470
 noticed very easily have been me well 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.510
 like 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:20.430
 But then I'm on my shoe 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:21.870
 we just go from the 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:23.790
 looks a bit better 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:27.120
 because he has a bit of leather design 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:29.640
 even if the gore tex he is warm 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:32.280
 Tick â€‹â€‹driver is worth every penny 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:34.080
 we're talking about a shoe from here 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.650
 Reindl is a well-known 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.300
 Manufacturer 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:49.250
 I have to put it on the march shortly 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:49.250
 mass effect 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:57.780
 if you and a shoe so who is for 

00:02:56.159 --> 00:02:58.200
 I sat in the first with extremely if that 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:59.340
 leather 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:02.370
 I have a little more to do 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:03.900
 but it is before the mesh but it is 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:05.489
 gore tex and that's fine too 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:06.420
 cortex is properly waterproof 

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:08.519
 breathable 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:10.739
 the thing is really cool I have the 

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:12.810
 for months in use and also sends 

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:14.599
 like to get up here in the mud 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:16.829
 or in a puddle 

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:18.480
 I have indicated that in Norway 

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:20.519
 Norway videos seen during the day and night 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:22.370
 and here on every tour I have this 

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:24.959
 Shoe on as you can see 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:28.319
 that is always fuller is already 

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:32.040
 clean in the relationship yes and that has 

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:36.200
 already that has really good services 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:43.489
 did mfs region or expectation 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:43.489
 so we always looked again 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:50.180
 is a high heel of so-called stands 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:50.180
 again and again the feet cold and so 

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:55.590
 it happened so far as I 

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:58.049
 I also received advice 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:04:00.840
 is he so wandering and soft 

00:03:58.049 --> 00:04:03.860
 mild our b is then more to 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:06.540
 climb the grill or you really do 

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:07.709
 Connection stiff shoes needs with 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:10.920
 a relatively tight son 

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:12.510
 So that's a combination and me 

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:13.980
 personally very happy for him 

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:15.750
 not so hard I really have one 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:17.729
 beige shoes attached then this is without 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:20.310
 visa board was not very pleasant 

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:21.720
 it is very flexible 

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:23.280
 but if you climb a bit 

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:25.710
 Spilled or slightly stirred or something 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:26.010
 is only slight support already quite 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:27.900
 Well 

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:30.240
 Let me advise you there draws the 

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:34.190
 Shoe request the miles and decide 

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:37.860
 you beautiful for this school year 

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:38.870
 I found these loops here very much 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:41.100
 enjoyable 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:42.750
 that was it can pull a really 

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:44.669
 should of course in rosales is clear 

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:46.320
 do not hold on but worry 

00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:49.050
 really a weird rome with that 

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:51.720
 stability has very nice at the side 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:53.970
 I liked that shoe that 

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:56.190
 Vacuum system that means one sees 

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:58.200
 this shoe turns down cut 

00:04:56.190 --> 00:05:00.210
 The festival will remain for about five minutes 

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:04.590
 and then the upper part of the fits 

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:06.120
 Shoe my foot shape then we pull 

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:07.800
 then go back and then there is 

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:09.180
 adjusted and up for 56 minutes 

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:11.520
 is that what happened and you are him 

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:12.979
 permanently adapted and I have to completely 

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:14.880
 to say honestly when I wear a shoe 

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:15.780
 I do not want to be that is not 

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:18.240
 especially difficult 

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:19.650
 nothing is super stable the water 

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:21.270
 Judge I'm already as I said 

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:22.650
 I ended up in a puddle 

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:25.289
 mud and dirt stood 

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:26.790
 with that I am already 20 kilometers the 

00:05:25.289 --> 00:05:29.160
 ran 

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:32.340
 super super comfortable from my point of view 

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:33.480
 top shoe 180 euros he has tasted like 

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:35.430
 i said i have a nice sport 

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:39.750
 Bought because that just here in the vicinity 

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:41.040
 is and specialty shops with the form i 

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:42.690
 I saw it here, too 

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:44.850
 are in break kit who out of the corner 

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:46.200
 is also mac track that there is yes 

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:46.980
 everywhere they have a lot 

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:48.840
 selection 

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:50.520
 because HOCHTIEF is even very large needs 

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:51.000
 but I say they did not have that 

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:54.570
 shoe 

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.770
 had searched little because this is here 

00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:58.350
 just wait for me like first 

00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:59.790
 I like the look of this leather look 

00:05:58.350 --> 00:06:01.680
 would have liked to have a real leather shoe 

00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:03.390
 but these are essential 

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:04.890
 easy-care and also correct water 

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:06.420
 really does not have to do anything there 

00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:09.240
 will not be washed or anything else 

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:09.660
 the running in this sense I can only 

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:12.330
 say 

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:13.650
 From my point of view, a top shoe who 

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:16.140
 I really want to buy that 

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:17.940
 recommend as I said 180 euro is one 

00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:19.620
 at the same time bought in the right size 

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:21.050
 that I have to be a little too small 

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:23.880
 have some air for the socks think about that 

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:25.830
 and then you have summer and winter and 

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:26.580
 Topcu worried the city to ask the 

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:29.100
 right socks 

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:30.120
 I have sock socks I can 

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:32.250
 also recommend 

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:34.410
 They are very comfortable to wear 

00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:35.940
 cost about 20 euro and then you have 

00:06:34.410 --> 00:06:37.320
 not only a good shoe but has 

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:39.900
 Also a good fit with the shoe 

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:41.820
 it does not bring anything super horny 

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:43.890
 bought trekking shoes has any 

00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:45.810
 socks griÃ±Ã¡n where the seams then press 

00:06:43.890 --> 00:06:48.360
 or where you get blown so pay attention 

00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:50.220
 When buying shoes also sincere socks 

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:52.430
 usually the specialist seller 

00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:55.230
 Specialist saleswoman will instruct you 

00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:57.390

00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:03.600
