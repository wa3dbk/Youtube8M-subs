going to export these files into my

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:48.580 
going to export these files into my
tutorial<00:00:43.440> file<00:00:43.620> in<00:00:44.059> a<00:00:45.059> sub<00:00:45.870> map<00:00:46.200> called<00:00:46.649> import

tutorial file in a sub map called import

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:51.400 
tutorial file in a sub map called import
so<00:00:49.590> let's<00:00:49.890> make<00:00:50.129> this<00:00:50.340> input<00:00:50.610> map<00:00:50.969> right<00:00:51.239> here

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:51.410 
so let's make this input map right here

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:55.459 
so let's make this input map right here
input<00:00:52.410> and<00:00:52.680> and<00:00:53.250> now<00:00:53.910> I'm<00:00:54.239> going<00:00:54.570> to<00:00:54.750> direct<00:00:55.410> it

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
input and and now I'm going to direct it

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:58.040 
input and and now I'm going to direct it
towards<00:00:55.920> the<00:00:56.579> input<00:00:56.879> file<00:00:57.059> now<00:00:57.600> it's<00:00:57.629> starting

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
towards the input file now it's starting

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.930 
towards the input file now it's starting
to<00:00:58.079> load<00:00:58.350> and<00:00:58.620> this<00:00:58.980> could<00:00:59.160> take<00:00:59.340> a<00:00:59.399> while<00:00:59.520> so

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
to load and this could take a while so

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:05.710 
to load and this could take a while so
I'll<00:01:00.180> paste<00:01:01.079> forward

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:05.720 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:08.560 

so<00:01:06.350> now<00:01:06.470> it's<00:01:06.710> done<00:01:07.190> so<00:01:07.850> let's<00:01:08.060> just<00:01:08.240> go<00:01:08.480> in

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:08.570 
so now it's done so let's just go in

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:12.220 
so now it's done so let's just go in
there<00:01:08.840> and<00:01:08.990> go<00:01:09.290> into<00:01:10.180> models<00:01:11.180> heroes<00:01:11.630> and<00:01:11.990> then

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:12.230 
there and go into models heroes and then

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:17.080 
there and go into models heroes and then
choose<00:01:13.130> X<00:01:14.830> probably<00:01:15.830> the<00:01:16.070> best<00:01:16.340> thing<00:01:16.760> to<00:01:16.820> do

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:17.090 
choose X probably the best thing to do

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:22.360 
choose X probably the best thing to do
would<00:01:17.450> be<00:01:17.510> to<00:01:17.690> just<00:01:18.430> drag<00:01:19.430> the<00:01:19.790> file<00:01:21.130> let's<00:01:22.130> now

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:22.370 
would be to just drag the file let's now

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:25.060 
would be to just drag the file let's now
just<00:01:22.610> make<00:01:22.850> a<00:01:22.880> new<00:01:23.150> file<00:01:23.420> called<00:01:23.840> X<00:01:24.140> exported

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:25.070 
just make a new file called X exported

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:29.710 
just make a new file called X exported
in<00:01:25.600> here<00:01:26.600> we<00:01:26.780> will<00:01:26.960> put<00:01:27.170> our<00:01:27.380> SMD<00:01:27.950> files<00:01:27.980> and<00:01:28.720> to

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:29.720 
in here we will put our SMD files and to

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:31.930 
in here we will put our SMD files and to
get<00:01:29.870> them<00:01:30.110> we'll<00:01:30.380> need<00:01:30.590> the<00:01:31.130> program<00:01:31.400> called

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:31.940 
get them we'll need the program called

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:36.390 
get them we'll need the program called
studio<00:01:32.540> compiler<00:01:33.640> so<00:01:34.640> let's<00:01:34.820> just<00:01:35.090> boot<00:01:35.420> it<00:01:35.570> up

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:36.400 
studio compiler so let's just boot it up

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:39.820 
studio compiler so let's just boot it up
let's<00:01:37.400> just<00:01:37.640> close<00:01:37.970> those<00:01:38.330> windows<00:01:38.830> then

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:39.830 
let's just close those windows then

let's just close those windows then
press<00:01:40.130> here<00:01:40.460> and<00:01:40.730> now<00:01:40.940> we're<00:01:41.090> just<00:01:41.120> going<00:01:41.570> to

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:41.660 
press here and now we're just going to

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:47.220 
press here and now we're just going to
direct<00:01:42.380> it<00:01:42.620> to<00:01:43.100> our<00:01:43.280> MDL<00:01:44.000> files<00:01:45.160> right<00:01:46.160> there

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:47.230 
direct it to our MDL files right there

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:51.780 
direct it to our MDL files right there
the<00:01:48.230> X<00:01:48.410> MDL<00:01:49.010> and<00:01:49.780> then<00:01:50.780> press<00:01:51.140> ok<00:01:51.320> and<00:01:51.590> now

we're<00:01:52.790> just<00:01:52.820> going<00:01:53.210> to<00:01:53.390> choose<00:01:53.870> the<00:01:54.080> export

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:54.500 
we're just going to choose the export

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:58.650 
we're just going to choose the export
location<00:01:55.120> so<00:01:56.120> I'll<00:01:56.180> just<00:01:56.360> copy<00:01:56.710> the<00:01:57.710> exported

00:01:58.650 --> 00:01:58.660 
location so I'll just copy the exported

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:01.990 
location so I'll just copy the exported
location<00:01:59.660> and<00:01:59.840> paste<00:02:00.350> it<00:02:00.560> and<00:02:01.010> then<00:02:01.250> it<00:02:01.640> starts

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:02.000 
location and paste it and then it starts

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.560 
location and paste it and then it starts
to<00:02:02.090> load<00:02:02.710> well<00:02:03.710> it<00:02:03.860> won't<00:02:04.130> work<00:02:04.550> since<00:02:05.390> you

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:05.570 
to load well it won't work since you

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:10.660 
to load well it won't work since you
need<00:02:05.930> to<00:02:06.110> change<00:02:06.530> the<00:02:07.130> name<00:02:07.820> from<00:02:08.179> DX<00:02:09.170> 90<00:02:09.890> to<00:02:10.070> DX

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:10.670 
need to change the name from DX 90 to DX

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:14.080 
need to change the name from DX 90 to DX
80<00:02:11.330> after<00:02:11.750> changing<00:02:12.590> the<00:02:12.739> name<00:02:12.920> it<00:02:13.190> won't<00:02:13.820> be<00:02:14.060> a

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
80 after changing the name it won't be a

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:17.260 
80 after changing the name it won't be a
problem<00:02:14.360> and<00:02:15.160> the<00:02:16.160> name<00:02:16.340> change<00:02:16.370> is<00:02:16.850> needed

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:17.270 
problem and the name change is needed

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:20.229 
problem and the name change is needed
since<00:02:17.840> the<00:02:18.230> studio<00:02:18.890> compiler<00:02:19.070> is<00:02:19.670> a<00:02:19.940> little

00:02:20.229 --> 00:02:20.239 
since the studio compiler is a little

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:23.920 
since the studio compiler is a little
bit<00:02:20.360> outdated<00:02:20.680> compared<00:02:21.680> to<00:02:21.950> dota<00:02:22.190> 2<00:02:22.750> so<00:02:23.750> now

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:23.930 
bit outdated compared to dota 2 so now

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:26.110 
bit outdated compared to dota 2 so now
we<00:02:23.989> don't<00:02:24.440> need<00:02:24.709> a<00:02:24.770> studio<00:02:25.280> compiler<00:02:25.459> for<00:02:25.910> this

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:26.120 
we don't need a studio compiler for this

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:28.830 
we don't need a studio compiler for this
tutorial<00:02:26.270> anymore<00:02:27.020> so<00:02:27.530> let's<00:02:27.709> just<00:02:28.010> close<00:02:28.310> it

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 
tutorial anymore so let's just close it

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:31.449 
tutorial anymore so let's just close it
now<00:02:29.840> we<00:02:29.900> just<00:02:30.170> need<00:02:30.530> one<00:02:30.560> thing<00:02:31.100> more<00:02:31.280> and

00:02:31.449 --> 00:02:31.459 
now we just need one thing more and

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:33.850 
now we just need one thing more and
that's<00:02:32.120> the<00:02:32.330> texture<00:02:32.690> so<00:02:33.410> let's<00:02:33.560> create<00:02:33.770> a

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:33.860 
that's the texture so let's create a

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:36.699 
that's the texture so let's create a
fast<00:02:34.100> file<00:02:34.370> a<00:02:34.400> name<00:02:34.700> a<00:02:34.850> texture<00:02:35.450> and<00:02:35.709> the

00:02:36.699 --> 00:02:36.709 
fast file a name a texture and the

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:39.509 
fast file a name a texture and the
texture<00:02:37.100> file<00:02:37.370> can<00:02:37.670> be<00:02:37.790> founded<00:02:38.180> in<00:02:38.420> import

00:02:39.509 --> 00:02:39.519 
texture file can be founded in import

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:44.890 
texture file can be founded in import
route<00:02:40.930> materials<00:02:41.980> modal's<00:02:43.060> heroes<00:02:44.060> and<00:02:44.390> then

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
route materials modal's heroes and then

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:49.030 
route materials modal's heroes and then
just<00:02:45.500> choose<00:02:45.739> X<00:02:46.070> and<00:02:47.200> to<00:02:48.200> open<00:02:48.530> these<00:02:48.739> files

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.040 
just choose X and to open these files

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:54.430 
just choose X and to open these files
we'll<00:02:49.820> need<00:02:50.060> the<00:02:50.680> vtf<00:02:51.680> edit<00:02:52.600> so<00:02:53.600> just<00:02:54.080> press

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:54.440 
we'll need the vtf edit so just press

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:59.520 
we'll need the vtf edit so just press
open<00:02:55.510> then<00:02:56.510> we'll<00:02:57.050> just<00:02:57.430> find<00:02:58.430> these<00:02:59.060> files

00:02:59.520 --> 00:02:59.530 
open then we'll just find these files

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:03.520 
open then we'll just find these files
completely<00:03:00.530> and<00:03:00.880> choose<00:03:01.880> the<00:03:02.180> right<00:03:02.360> one<00:03:02.630> oops

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:03.530 
completely and choose the right one oops

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:06.970 
completely and choose the right one oops
this<00:03:03.890> was<00:03:04.190> the<00:03:04.340> wrong<00:03:04.459> one<00:03:04.750> it's<00:03:05.750> the<00:03:06.170> X<00:03:06.590> body

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:06.980 
this was the wrong one it's the X body

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:09.729 
this was the wrong one it's the X body
color<00:03:07.330> and<00:03:08.330> now<00:03:08.540> we'll<00:03:08.780> just<00:03:08.959> export<00:03:09.560> it<00:03:09.680> to

00:03:09.729 --> 00:03:09.739 
color and now we'll just export it to

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:14.680 
color and now we'll just export it to
the<00:03:10.180> texture<00:03:11.260> map<00:03:12.280> can<00:03:13.280> get<00:03:13.459> normals<00:03:14.180> and

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:14.690 
the texture map can get normals and

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:16.440 
the texture map can get normals and
other<00:03:15.260> stuff<00:03:15.650> like<00:03:15.890> that

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:16.450 
other stuff like that

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:19.320 
other stuff like that
it's<00:03:16.750> called<00:03:17.050> X<00:03:17.319> body<00:03:17.620> mask<00:03:17.890> -<00:03:18.190> and<00:03:18.520> export

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:19.330 
it's called X body mask - and export

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:22.949 
it's called X body mask - and export
mask<00:03:19.569> normal<00:03:20.410> but<00:03:21.340> those<00:03:21.670> things<00:03:22.150> we<00:03:22.630> will<00:03:22.810> go

00:03:22.949 --> 00:03:22.959 
mask normal but those things we will go

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:26.910 
mask normal but those things we will go
through<00:03:23.290> in<00:03:23.500> another<00:03:23.680> clip<00:03:24.989> so<00:03:25.989> here<00:03:26.380> I<00:03:26.650> have

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:26.920 
through in another clip so here I have

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:30.180 
through in another clip so here I have
the<00:03:27.220> older<00:03:27.640> textures<00:03:28.120> to<00:03:28.390> the<00:03:29.319> body<00:03:29.920> color

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:30.190 
the older textures to the body color

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:33.300 
the older textures to the body color
body<00:03:30.610> mask<00:03:30.940> and<00:03:31.300> then<00:03:31.599> body<00:03:31.870> normal<00:03:32.310> whoops

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:33.310 
body mask and then body normal whoops

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:36.120 
body mask and then body normal whoops
boot<00:03:33.610> it<00:03:33.730> up<00:03:33.850> Photoshop<00:03:34.420> accidently<00:03:35.020> and<00:03:35.200> now

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:36.130 
boot it up Photoshop accidently and now

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:39.540 
boot it up Photoshop accidently and now
we<00:03:36.190> just<00:03:36.459> start<00:03:36.880> bender<00:03:37.680> so<00:03:38.680> let<00:03:39.280> me<00:03:39.430> just

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:39.550 
we just start bender so let me just

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:42.479 
we just start bender so let me just
resize<00:03:39.970> the<00:03:40.120> screen<00:03:40.150> and<00:03:40.980> the<00:03:41.980> one<00:03:42.010> thing<00:03:42.430> we

00:03:42.479 --> 00:03:42.489 
resize the screen and the one thing we

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:45.509 
resize the screen and the one thing we
left<00:03:42.819> now<00:03:43.090> is<00:03:43.450> to<00:03:43.900> just<00:03:44.080> import<00:03:44.860> the<00:03:45.069> SMD<00:03:45.489> files

00:03:45.509 --> 00:03:45.519 
left now is to just import the SMD files

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:49.770 
left now is to just import the SMD files
of<00:03:46.120> X<00:03:47.099> let<00:03:48.099> me<00:03:48.340> just<00:03:48.519> prepare<00:03:49.000> for<00:03:49.300> the<00:03:49.360> model

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:49.780 
of X let me just prepare for the model

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:53.580 
of X let me just prepare for the model
to<00:03:49.959> be<00:03:50.680> shown<00:03:50.920> here<00:03:51.250> and<00:03:51.840> so<00:03:52.840> now<00:03:53.019> when<00:03:53.319> this<00:03:53.530> is

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:53.590 
to be shown here and so now when this is

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:58.800 
to be shown here and so now when this is
fixed<00:03:54.100> we<00:03:54.400> can<00:03:54.640> start<00:03:55.239> to<00:03:55.390> import<00:03:57.030> the<00:03:58.030> SMD

00:03:58.800 --> 00:03:58.810 
fixed we can start to import the SMD

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:03.030 
fixed we can start to import the SMD
file<00:04:00.299> yeah<00:04:01.299> right<00:04:01.600> here<00:04:01.780> then<00:04:02.319> we'll<00:04:02.590> just

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:03.040 
file yeah right here then we'll just

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:10.670 
file yeah right here then we'll just
find<00:04:03.459> the<00:04:04.000> files<00:04:04.239> we<00:04:04.660> made<00:04:07.230> desktop<00:04:08.370> tutorial

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:10.680 
find the files we made desktop tutorial

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:14.460 
find the files we made desktop tutorial
1x<00:04:11.680> exported<00:04:12.580> and<00:04:12.870> then<00:04:13.870> we'll<00:04:14.170> choose<00:04:14.410> the

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:14.470 
1x exported and then we'll choose the

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:21.150 
1x exported and then we'll choose the
biggest<00:04:15.190> file<00:04:15.459> let's<00:04:16.239> see<00:04:16.419> here<00:04:16.690> this<00:04:17.680> one<00:04:20.160> so

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:21.160 
biggest file let's see here this one so

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:24.360 
biggest file let's see here this one so
now<00:04:21.340> when<00:04:21.549> he<00:04:21.700> is<00:04:21.760> imported<00:04:22.360> we<00:04:22.720> could<00:04:23.370> just

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:24.370 
now when he is imported we could just

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:27.930 
now when he is imported we could just
tilt<00:04:24.970> the<00:04:25.120> camera<00:04:25.330> right<00:04:25.780> and<00:04:26.370> then<00:04:27.370> fix<00:04:27.640> his

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:27.940 
tilt the camera right and then fix his

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:31.230 
tilt the camera right and then fix his
rotation<00:04:28.720> and<00:04:29.460> that<00:04:30.460> should<00:04:30.700> be<00:04:30.820> done<00:04:31.000> by

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:31.240 
rotation and that should be done by

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:35.490 
rotation and that should be done by
pressing<00:04:31.840> this<00:04:32.650> feed<00:04:33.280> bone<00:04:34.020> then<00:04:35.020> pressing

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:35.500 
pressing this feed bone then pressing

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:41.730 
pressing this feed bone then pressing
all<00:04:35.710> the<00:04:35.770> our<00:04:36.310> button<00:04:37.169> then<00:04:38.340> X<00:04:39.340> and<00:04:40.560> then<00:04:41.560> nine

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:41.740 
all the our button then X and then nine

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:46.530 
all the our button then X and then nine
right<00:04:42.310> 19<00:04:42.910> and<00:04:43.150> he'll<00:04:43.570> stand<00:04:44.229> up

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:46.540 
right 19 and he'll stand up

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:50.490 

and<00:04:46.830> that's<00:04:47.830> how<00:04:48.100> you<00:04:48.160> import<00:04:48.930> the<00:04:49.930> delta2

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:50.500 
and that's how you import the delta2

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:54.030 
and that's how you import the delta2
file<00:04:50.830> into<00:04:51.370> blender<00:04:51.760> I<00:04:52.170> just<00:04:53.170> fast<00:04:53.530> show<00:04:53.980> you

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:54.040 
file into blender I just fast show you

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:57.200 
file into blender I just fast show you
how<00:04:54.610> it<00:04:54.760> looks<00:04:55.000> like<00:04:55.240> with<00:04:55.450> the<00:04:55.570> textures<00:04:56.170> on

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:57.210 
how it looks like with the textures on

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:01.350 
how it looks like with the textures on
remove<00:04:58.210> the<00:04:58.510> light<00:04:59.550> go<00:05:00.550> to<00:05:00.610> one<00:05:00.940> of<00:05:00.970> these

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:01.360 
remove the light go to one of these

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:02.250 
remove the light go to one of these
areas

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:02.260 
areas

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:07.320 
areas
select<00:05:02.950> the<00:05:03.370> image<00:05:03.910> editor<00:05:05.430> the<00:05:06.430> fastest<00:05:06.940> way

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:07.330 
select the image editor the fastest way

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:09.630 
select the image editor the fastest way
to<00:05:07.360> do<00:05:07.660> it<00:05:07.780> is<00:05:07.990> to<00:05:08.260> click<00:05:08.890> on<00:05:09.040> him<00:05:09.190> mark

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:09.640 
to do it is to click on him mark

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:13.610 
to do it is to click on him mark
everything<00:05:10.030> and<00:05:10.360> then<00:05:11.020> open<00:05:11.800> up<00:05:11.950> an<00:05:12.310> image

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:13.620 
everything and then open up an image

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:16.530 
everything and then open up an image
this<00:05:14.620> image<00:05:14.950> will<00:05:15.310> then<00:05:15.490> be<00:05:15.700> overlapped<00:05:16.240> over

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:16.540 
this image will then be overlapped over

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:20.430 
this image will then be overlapped over
the<00:05:16.780> UV<00:05:17.590> and<00:05:17.890> thus<00:05:18.640> give<00:05:19.030> him<00:05:19.300> his<00:05:19.570> texture

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:20.440 
the UV and thus give him his texture

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:24.170 
the UV and thus give him his texture
look<00:05:20.800> here's<00:05:21.550> the<00:05:21.790> file<00:05:22.030> and<00:05:22.210> now<00:05:23.170> it's<00:05:23.560> done<00:05:23.830> I

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:24.180 
look here's the file and now it's done I

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:26.310 
look here's the file and now it's done I
hope<00:05:25.180> I<00:05:25.390> helped<00:05:25.600> you<00:05:25.780> much<00:05:25.930> with<00:05:26.170> this

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:26.320 
hope I helped you much with this
