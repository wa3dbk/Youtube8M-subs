00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:21.430 
it was a coughing fit Fowler clapping so

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:23.280

scratches<00:01:23.740> the<00:01:24.189> urban<00:01:25.119> architecture<00:01:25.390> as<00:01:25.990> you

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:26.080 
scratches the urban architecture as you

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:29.640 
scratches the urban architecture as you
go<00:01:26.229> past<00:01:26.470> it<00:01:26.680> like<00:01:26.890> that<00:01:28.170> by<00:01:29.170> then<00:01:29.500> when<00:01:29.590> you

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:29.650 
go past it like that by then when you

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:30.929 
go past it like that by then when you
come<00:01:29.799> off<00:01:29.830> the<00:01:30.040> end<00:01:30.159> it's<00:01:30.369> best<00:01:30.549> to<00:01:30.640> land<00:01:30.820> on

00:01:30.929 --> 00:01:30.939 
come off the end it's best to land on

00:01:30.939 --> 00:01:32.910 
come off the end it's best to land on
four<00:01:31.180> wheels<00:01:31.450> and<00:01:32.140> not<00:01:32.350> on<00:01:32.439> the<00:01:32.499> side<00:01:32.710> of<00:01:32.740> the

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:32.920 
four wheels and not on the side of the

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:34.349 
four wheels and not on the side of the
board<00:01:33.130> otherwise<00:01:33.429> you<00:01:33.549> just<00:01:33.700> stop<00:01:33.969> really

00:01:34.349 --> 00:01:34.359 
board otherwise you just stop really

00:01:34.359 --> 00:01:36.270 
board otherwise you just stop really
fall<00:01:34.539> over<00:01:34.869> any<00:01:35.320> can<00:01:35.560> hurt<00:01:35.770> yourself<00:01:35.859> doing

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:36.280 
fall over any can hurt yourself doing

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:37.830 
fall over any can hurt yourself doing
that<00:01:36.429> so<00:01:36.729> just<00:01:36.880> be<00:01:37.060> careful<00:01:37.240> out<00:01:37.539> there<00:01:37.600> all

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:37.840 
that so just be careful out there all

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:44.370 
that so just be careful out there all
right<00:01:37.960> shaka-brah<00:01:38.920> and<00:01:40.049> we<00:01:41.049> do<00:01:42.509> 150

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:44.380 
right shaka-brah and we do 150

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:45.959 
right shaka-brah and we do 150
approach<00:01:44.860> the<00:01:44.890> obstacle<00:01:45.430> the<00:01:45.460> same<00:01:45.759> way<00:01:45.909> you

00:01:45.959 --> 00:01:45.969 
approach the obstacle the same way you

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:48.539 
approach the obstacle the same way you
did<00:01:46.210> for<00:01:46.450> fifty<00:01:46.719> fifty<00:01:47.110> as<00:01:47.799> you<00:01:48.009> find<00:01:48.219> yourself

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:48.549 
did for fifty fifty as you find yourself

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:50.850 
did for fifty fifty as you find yourself
a<00:01:48.640> foot<00:01:48.939> from<00:01:49.149> the<00:01:49.240> chosen<00:01:49.509> object<00:01:50.079> aim<00:01:50.530> to<00:01:50.770> be

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:50.860 
a foot from the chosen object aim to be

a foot from the chosen object aim to be
landing<00:01:51.189> on<00:01:51.250> the<00:01:51.399> back<00:01:51.549> truck<00:01:51.899> it's<00:01:52.899> basically

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:53.320 
landing on the back truck it's basically

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:55.620 
landing on the back truck it's basically
about<00:01:53.530> the<00:01:53.799> same<00:01:54.009> as<00:01:54.189> a<00:01:54.220> 50-50<00:01:54.939> difference

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:55.630 
about the same as a 50-50 difference

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:57.149 
about the same as a 50-50 difference
being<00:01:55.869> you<00:01:56.110> need<00:01:56.259> to<00:01:56.380> land<00:01:56.560> more<00:01:56.920> weight

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:57.159 
being you need to land more weight

00:01:57.159 --> 00:01:59.219 
being you need to land more weight
towards<00:01:57.399> the<00:01:57.700> back<00:01:57.880> foot<00:01:58.119> and<00:01:58.420> not<00:01:58.899> too<00:01:59.079> much
