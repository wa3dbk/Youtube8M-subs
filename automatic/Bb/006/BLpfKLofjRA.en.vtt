00:00:00.849 --> 00:00:04.440
 reflecting the proposal 8 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:05.800
 8 

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:06.999
 the 

00:00:06.999 --> 00:00:09.999
 8 it 

00:00:11.399 --> 00:00:14.699
 actually 

00:00:14.699 --> 00:00:17.439
 for example, you like playing 

00:00:17.439 --> 00:00:20.779
 two years it should actually have fallen three years its own typical 

00:00:21.409 --> 00:00:22.250
 what kind 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:26.570
 or is now very liked and further on the television I saw a flute I thought 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:28.079
 I like that 

00:00:28.079 --> 00:00:30.939
 that sounds nice that looks nice 9 

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:33.290
 at5 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:35.720
 actually a list 

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:38.860
 it sounded a nice overview the singer that sounded 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.110
 cheerful 

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:43.890
 I thought it was pleasant 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.570
 own 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:48.780
 this is a film adaptation 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.380
 has made of wood 

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:53.480
 with its silver flaps 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:55.840
 he can also be completely wild 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:58.880
 He can also be the biggest and it is not a fact 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:02.080
 it is played on the side 

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:03.900
 worked in purpose 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:06.400
 just imagine that you have a beer bottle 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:09.750
 tried that kind of thing and you place it on a beer bottle like that 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.050
 and I showed him out 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:13.380
 but that 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.600
 sitting beer bottle when I am here 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.600
 then you get this done 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:27.360
 well then go out to blow a tower and that moment with all these clubs 

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:29.810
 can I then 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:32.810
 make other notes 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.410
 this made the german men 

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:43.720
 if you close all clubs 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:46.840
 it is a longer can match with a beer bottle 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:50.340
 the more water everyone does 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.340
 the higher the tone becomes the levi beer bottle 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:02.580
 difficult instrument 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:06.050
 make great big customers in a good way 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:09.479
 that's hard at the window it's not that we have a violin 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:12.830
 according to the broadcaster de botton nothing to one I know that all must do 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:16.360
 but to make a beautiful sound goes through the years 

00:02:23.539 --> 00:02:25.699
 thirteen goals 

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:28.799
 then I really want to be in the North Holland youth orchestra 

00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:31.319
 and luckily there was a place free 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:32.889
 and then I was allowed to play there 

00:02:32.889 --> 00:02:35.639
 ice creams 

00:02:35.639 --> 00:02:41.009
 it's really about laughter I focus on the games I just get goosebumps on 

00:02:41.009 --> 00:02:44.009
 my back so difficult next to one 

00:02:44.889 --> 00:02:47.889
 and there is a fall in love begins 

00:02:48.539 --> 00:02:50.909
 the experts 8 

00:02:50.909 --> 00:02:53.039
 I played 

00:02:53.039 --> 00:02:54.469
 there is only
