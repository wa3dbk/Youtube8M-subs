00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.169 
screen obviously you can do all sorts of
different<00:00:49.559> options<00:00:49.710> with<00:00:50.100> this<00:00:50.249> one<00:00:51.030> of<00:00:51.120> the

00:00:51.169 --> 00:00:51.179 
different options with this one of the

00:00:51.179 --> 00:00:53.329 
different options with this one of the
fun<00:00:51.420> ones<00:00:51.629> with<00:00:51.780> that<00:00:51.870> it's<00:00:52.079> touchscreen<00:00:52.620> yeah

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:53.339 
fun ones with that it's touchscreen yeah

00:00:53.339 --> 00:00:55.340 
fun ones with that it's touchscreen yeah
one<00:00:53.519> of<00:00:53.550> the<00:00:53.670> things<00:00:53.699> we<00:00:53.969> know<00:00:54.149> is<00:00:54.179> because<00:00:55.170> of

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
one of the things we know is because of

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.770 
one of the things we know is because of
iPhones<00:00:55.829> and<00:00:56.159> other<00:00:56.280> things<00:00:56.670> people<00:00:57.210> like<00:00:57.480> to

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
iPhones and other things people like to

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.689 
iPhones and other things people like to
be<00:00:57.929> able<00:00:58.019> to<00:00:58.140> touch<00:00:58.409> and<00:00:58.769> change<00:00:58.829> the<00:00:59.550> way

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
be able to touch and change the way

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.969 
be able to touch and change the way
they're<00:01:00.300> supreme<00:01:00.780> look<00:01:01.050> so<00:01:01.350> we<00:01:01.499> have<00:01:01.620> a<00:01:01.649> full

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:01.979 
they're supreme look so we have a full

00:01:01.979 --> 00:01:04.700 
they're supreme look so we have a full
touchscreen<00:01:02.870> setup<00:01:03.870> which<00:01:04.050> allows<00:01:04.350> you<00:01:04.680> to

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
touchscreen setup which allows you to

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.010 
touchscreen setup which allows you to
customize<00:01:05.340> the<00:01:05.610> colors<00:01:06.030> the<00:01:06.330> type<00:01:06.540> of<00:01:06.810> gauge

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
customize the colors the type of gauge

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.070 
customize the colors the type of gauge
the<00:01:07.380> location<00:01:07.950> of<00:01:08.100> those<00:01:08.280> gauges<00:01:08.630> on<00:01:09.630> your

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
the location of those gauges on your

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.050 
the location of those gauges on your
display<00:01:10.440> to<00:01:10.560> make<00:01:10.860> it<00:01:11.070> unique<00:01:11.370> for<00:01:11.580> your<00:01:11.790> car

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
display to make it unique for your car

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.930 
display to make it unique for your car
and<00:01:12.360> then<00:01:13.230> onward<00:01:13.890> to<00:01:14.070> different<00:01:14.460> options

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:14.940 
and then onward to different options

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:16.430 
and then onward to different options
you've<00:01:15.210> got<00:01:15.360> shift<00:01:15.660> lights<00:01:15.960> you've<00:01:16.290> got

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:16.440 
you've got shift lights you've got

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:18.350 
you've got shift lights you've got
different<00:01:16.830> boxes<00:01:17.730> so<00:01:17.850> that<00:01:18.000> you<00:01:18.090> can<00:01:18.210> plug

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
different boxes so that you can plug

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.630 
different boxes so that you can plug
this<00:01:18.480> into<00:01:18.690> your<00:01:18.960> vehicle<00:01:19.590> hardwire<00:01:20.250> what

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
this into your vehicle hardwire what

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.400 
this into your vehicle hardwire what
else<00:01:20.790> can<00:01:21.000> you<00:01:21.030> do<00:01:21.180> yeah<00:01:21.600> so<00:01:21.780> what<00:01:21.930> we<00:01:22.050> know<00:01:22.200> is

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:22.410 
else can you do yeah so what we know is

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:24.200 
else can you do yeah so what we know is
not<00:01:22.590> every<00:01:22.980> vehicle<00:01:23.190> is<00:01:23.400> the<00:01:23.520> same<00:01:23.760> so<00:01:24.120> you

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
not every vehicle is the same so you

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.660 
not every vehicle is the same so you
have<00:01:24.450> the<00:01:24.630> option<00:01:25.170> of<00:01:25.350> having<00:01:25.860> a

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
have the option of having a

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.730 
have the option of having a
plug-and-play<00:01:26.970> solution<00:01:27.570> or<00:01:28.200> a<00:01:28.230> traditional

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
plug-and-play solution or a traditional

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.670 
plug-and-play solution or a traditional
sensor<00:01:29.520> driven<00:01:29.940> through<00:01:30.570> two<00:01:30.750> different<00:01:31.170> ways

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
sensor driven through two different ways

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.980 
sensor driven through two different ways
we<00:01:32.100> have<00:01:32.130> a<00:01:32.280> Bluetooth<00:01:32.820> module<00:01:33.030> that<00:01:33.540> can<00:01:33.720> plug

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
we have a Bluetooth module that can plug

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.830 
we have a Bluetooth module that can plug
into<00:01:34.230> the<00:01:34.470> OBD<00:01:34.920> port<00:01:34.950> and<00:01:35.490> then<00:01:36.120> wirelessly

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
into the OBD port and then wirelessly

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.790 
into the OBD port and then wirelessly
feed<00:01:37.260> our<00:01:37.500> display<00:01:37.980> or<00:01:38.940> if<00:01:39.570> you<00:01:39.840> have<00:01:40.140> an<00:01:40.380> ECU

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:40.800 
feed our display or if you have an ECU

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:43.730 
feed our display or if you have an ECU
and<00:01:41.370> you<00:01:41.580> need<00:01:41.760> to<00:01:41.910> hardwire<00:01:42.420> that<00:01:43.320> we<00:01:43.530> can

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
and you need to hardwire that we can

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.280 
and you need to hardwire that we can
hardwire<00:01:44.040> to<00:01:44.460> an<00:01:44.520> ECU<00:01:44.910> and<00:01:45.300> then<00:01:45.930> for

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
hardwire to an ECU and then for

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.470 
hardwire to an ECU and then for
carburetors<00:01:47.100> or<00:01:47.250> more<00:01:47.400> traditional<00:01:47.970> cars<00:01:48.210> we

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:48.480 
carburetors or more traditional cars we

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:50.660 
carburetors or more traditional cars we
have<00:01:48.630> a<00:01:48.660> sensor<00:01:49.080> module<00:01:49.560> where<00:01:50.220> you<00:01:50.310> can<00:01:50.460> plug

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
have a sensor module where you can plug

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.420 
have a sensor module where you can plug
into<00:01:50.910> up<00:01:51.210> to<00:01:51.660> eight<00:01:51.870> different<00:01:52.410> sensors<00:01:53.130> and

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
into up to eight different sensors and

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.570 
into up to eight different sensors and
if<00:01:53.640> you<00:01:53.730> need<00:01:53.880> more<00:01:54.090> you<00:01:54.300> can<00:01:54.330> stack<00:01:54.810> those<00:01:55.050> my

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:55.580 
if you need more you can stack those my

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:57.700 
if you need more you can stack those my
on<00:01:55.850> top<00:01:56.120> of<00:01:56.150> each<00:01:56.450> other<00:01:56.720> so<00:01:56.840> you<00:01:57.500> can<00:01:57.620> either

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:57.710 
on top of each other so you can either

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:58.660 
on top of each other so you can either
be<00:01:57.860> plug-and-play

00:01:58.660 --> 00:01:58.670 
be plug-and-play
