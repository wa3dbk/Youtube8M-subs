00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
work like signs so it depends on the

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.870 
work like signs so it depends on the
angle<00:01:15.450> of<00:01:15.840> where<00:01:16.049> you<00:01:16.170> place<00:01:16.409> it<00:01:16.680> like<00:01:17.549> if<00:01:17.759> I

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
angle of where you place it like if I

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.520 
angle of where you place it like if I

were to place it this way then the head

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.710 
were to place it this way then the head
would<00:01:19.680> point<00:01:19.890> this<00:01:20.070> way<00:01:20.369> or<00:01:21.119> to<00:01:21.240> place<00:01:21.450> it<00:01:21.600> this

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
would point this way or to place it this

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.120 
would point this way or to place it this
way<00:01:21.840> they<00:01:21.990> have<00:01:22.170> a<00:01:22.259> point<00:01:22.439> that<00:01:22.650> way<00:01:22.799> just<00:01:23.040> like

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:05.660 
ahead and I these pigs in using the

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:07.600 
ahead and I these pigs in using the
carrot<00:04:05.930> on<00:04:06.049> a<00:04:06.079> stick<00:04:06.350> you<00:04:06.890> can<00:04:07.040> now<00:04:07.190> control

carrot on a stick you can now control

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:09.670 
carrot on a stick you can now control
the<00:04:07.819> direction<00:04:08.000> you<00:04:08.959> want<00:04:08.989> your<00:04:09.349> pic<00:04:09.530> to

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:09.680 
the direction you want your pic to

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:12.760 
the direction you want your pic to
travel<00:04:10.129> and<00:04:10.360> I<00:04:11.360> think<00:04:11.690> like<00:04:12.050> the<00:04:12.170> best<00:04:12.440> use<00:04:12.739> for

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:12.770 
travel and I think like the best use for

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:17.680 
travel and I think like the best use for
this<00:04:13.099> would<00:04:13.340> be<00:04:13.520> oh<00:04:14.590> I<00:04:16.150> think<00:04:17.150> the<00:04:17.239> best<00:04:17.450> use

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:17.690 
this would be oh I think the best use

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:19.990 
this would be oh I think the best use
for<00:04:17.720> this<00:04:18.020> would<00:04:18.229> be<00:04:18.380> like<00:04:18.680> a<00:04:18.950> FK<00:04:19.370> travelling

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:20.000 
for this would be like a FK travelling

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.810 
for this would be like a FK travelling
