00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
and it goes all the way around so it

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:18.679 
and it goes all the way around so it
makes<00:01:17.219> it<00:01:17.369> look<00:01:17.549> like<00:01:17.610> the<00:01:17.909> case<00:01:18.119> is<00:01:18.329> too<00:01:18.509> big

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689
