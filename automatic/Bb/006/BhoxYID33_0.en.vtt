00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:41.990 
why not start with some wet cleansing

because<00:00:55.949> I've<00:00:56.039> seen<00:00:56.250> a<00:00:56.280> few<00:00:56.460> people<00:00:56.879> on

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
because I've seen a few people on

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.180 
because I've seen a few people on
YouTube<00:00:57.390> tried<00:00:58.109> or<00:00:58.350> use<00:00:58.559> this<00:00:58.739> brush<00:00:58.949> with

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
YouTube tried or use this brush with

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:00.410 
YouTube tried or use this brush with
their<00:00:59.309> powders<00:00:59.670> and<00:00:59.699> I<00:00:59.910> really<00:01:00.149> like<00:01:00.239> the<00:01:00.390> way

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
their powders and I really like the way

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.660 
their powders and I really like the way
the<00:01:00.660> powder<00:01:00.899> applies<00:01:01.379> to<00:01:01.649> their<00:01:01.770> faces<00:01:02.039> so<00:01:02.460> I

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
the powder applies to their faces so I

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.429

most of them these three looked really

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:59.509 
most of them these three looked really
really<00:02:57.840> beautiful<00:02:58.110> a<00:02:58.560> nice<00:02:58.800> highlight<00:02:59.130> nice

really beautiful a nice highlight nice
pink<00:02:59.880> nice<00:03:00.150> coral<00:03:00.570> and<00:03:00.720> possibly<00:03:01.709> this<00:03:01.890> could

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
pink nice coral and possibly this could

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:03.650 
pink nice coral and possibly this could
work<00:03:02.250> for<00:03:02.430> people<00:03:02.670> who<00:03:02.730> don't<00:03:02.880> mind<00:03:03.239> glitter

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:03.660 
work for people who don't mind glitter

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:05.210

trying to think how many years but i
don't<00:03:32.700> know<00:03:32.790> it's<00:03:32.970> been<00:03:33.120> a<00:03:33.150> very<00:03:33.239> very<00:03:33.660> long

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:33.989 
don't know it's been a very very long

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:36.440 
don't know it's been a very very long
time<00:03:34.049> it<00:03:34.620> doesn't<00:03:35.010> stink<00:03:35.519> or<00:03:35.820> taste<00:03:36.060> weird<00:03:36.299> or

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:36.450

anything<00:03:36.480> like<00:03:36.780> that<00:03:36.900> the<00:03:37.200> 1i<00:03:37.380> own<00:03:37.650> but<00:03:37.860> I<00:03:37.890> just

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:38.040 
anything like that the 1i own but I just

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:40.009 
anything like that the 1i own but I just
figured<00:03:38.280> it's<00:03:38.790> kind<00:03:39.000> of<00:03:39.060> gross<00:03:39.299> so<00:03:39.630> it's<00:03:39.959> about

00:03:40.009 --> 00:03:40.019 
figured it's kind of gross so it's about

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:41.930 
figured it's kind of gross so it's about
time<00:03:40.410> I<00:03:40.530> throw<00:03:40.680> that<00:03:40.739> one<00:03:41.010> out<00:03:41.040> and<00:03:41.400> replace<00:03:41.910> it

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:41.940 
time I throw that one out and replace it

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:44.120 
time I throw that one out and replace it
so<00:03:42.780> I<00:03:42.810> just<00:03:43.140> picked<00:03:43.320> up<00:03:43.410> a<00:03:43.560> new<00:03:43.739> one<00:03:43.890> and<00:03:44.040> if

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:51.740 
not a very opaque lip gloss it's just
kind<00:03:49.950> of<00:03:49.980> like<00:03:50.130> a<00:03:50.160> sheer<00:03:50.549> wash<00:03:50.850> of<00:03:50.880> pink<00:03:51.570> with<00:03:51.720> a

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:51.750 
kind of like a sheer wash of pink with a

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:54.020 
kind of like a sheer wash of pink with a
little<00:03:52.290> bit<00:03:52.440> of<00:03:52.470> sheen<00:03:52.860> to<00:03:52.890> it<00:03:53.160> but<00:03:53.790> i<00:03:53.820> just

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:54.030 
little bit of sheen to it but i just

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:55.819 
little bit of sheen to it but i just
love<00:03:54.329> the<00:03:54.480> way<00:03:54.510> it<00:03:54.720> where's<00:03:55.079> the<00:03:55.350> way<00:03:55.470> it<00:03:55.590> feels
