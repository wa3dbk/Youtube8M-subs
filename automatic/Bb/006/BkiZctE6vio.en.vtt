00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
the game from the game which mod made

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.270 
the game from the game which mod made
sense<00:00:36.899> anyway<00:00:37.380> like<00:00:37.739> the<00:00:37.920> smoke<00:00:38.100> crystal

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
sense anyway like the smoke crystal

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.880 
sense anyway like the smoke crystal
smoke<00:00:39.030> -<00:00:39.239> in<00:00:39.510> the<00:00:39.690> smoke<00:00:39.870> chain<00:00:40.140> so<00:00:40.649> what<00:00:40.739> Jane

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
smoke - in the smoke chain so what Jane

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.000 
smoke - in the smoke chain so what Jane
does<00:00:41.040> 14<00:00:41.460> hundreds<00:00:42.030> of<00:00:42.239> damage<00:00:42.890> which<00:00:43.890> is

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
does 14 hundreds of damage which is

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.520 
does 14 hundreds of damage which is
pretty<00:00:44.460> impressive<00:00:45.230> since<00:00:46.230> they<00:00:46.350> can

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
pretty impressive since they can

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.410

here<00:01:26.639> so<00:01:27.030> this<00:01:27.179> is<00:01:27.240> how<00:01:27.299> you<00:01:27.359> get<00:01:27.450> a<00:01:27.539> smoke

00:01:27.739 --> 00:01:27.749 
here so this is how you get a smoke

00:01:27.749 --> 00:01:29.300 
here so this is how you get a smoke
crystal<00:01:28.139> which<00:01:28.289> is<00:01:28.439> for<00:01:28.740> fire<00:01:28.859> charges

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
crystal which is for fire charges

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.359 
crystal which is for fire charges
surrounding<00:01:29.999> a<00:01:30.030> diamond<00:01:30.420> or<00:01:30.600> D<00:01:30.840> Mondays<00:01:31.369> like

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
surrounding a diamond or D Mondays like

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.580 
surrounding a diamond or D Mondays like
this<00:01:32.579> and<00:01:32.880> then<00:01:33.209> you're<00:01:34.170> going<00:01:34.289> to<00:01:34.380> take<00:01:34.560> a

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
this and then you're going to take a

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.649 
this and then you're going to take a
smoke<00:01:34.799> crystal<00:01:35.159> put<00:01:35.520> in<00:01:35.670> this<00:01:35.880> to<00:01:36.209> get<00:01:36.329> and

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
smoke crystal put in this to get and

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.539 
smoke crystal put in this to get and
another<00:01:37.439> crafting<00:01:37.770> table<00:01:38.039> and<00:01:38.159> it's<00:01:38.340> probably

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
another crafting table and it's probably

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.449 
another crafting table and it's probably
close<00:01:38.880> them<00:01:39.030> to<00:01:39.119> get<00:01:39.240> the<00:01:39.299> neon<00:01:39.420> crystal

00:01:40.449 --> 00:01:40.459 
close them to get the neon crystal

00:01:40.459 --> 00:01:43.309 
close them to get the neon crystal
there's<00:01:41.459> neon<00:01:41.670> blocks<00:01:41.939> in<00:01:42.270> the<00:01:42.389> in<00:01:42.990> the<00:01:43.139> game

00:01:43.309 --> 00:01:43.319 
there's neon blocks in the in the game

00:01:43.319 --> 00:01:45.319 
there's neon blocks in the in the game
but<00:01:43.709> like<00:01:44.249> they're<00:01:44.549> not<00:01:44.700> implemented<00:01:45.149> into

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
but like they're not implemented into

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:46.609 
but like they're not implemented into
the<00:01:45.359> game<00:01:45.450> there<00:01:45.779> in<00:01:45.869> like<00:01:45.990> to<00:01:46.079> configure<00:01:46.380> I

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
the game there in like to configure I

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.230 
the game there in like to configure I
don't<00:01:46.770> know<00:01:46.829> why<00:01:47.009> I<00:01:47.219> think<00:01:47.789> I<00:01:47.939> think<00:01:48.179> that's

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
don't know why I think I think that's

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:49.609 
don't know why I think I think that's
going<00:01:48.689> to<00:01:48.779> be<00:01:48.840> a<00:01:48.869> supposed<00:01:49.109> to<00:01:49.170> change<00:01:49.350> me<00:01:49.529> and

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
going to be a supposed to change me and

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:52.129 
going to be a supposed to change me and
eventually<00:01:49.859> anyone<00:01:50.789> and<00:01:51.029> then<00:01:51.630> you<00:01:51.990> take

00:01:52.129 --> 00:01:52.139 
eventually anyone and then you take

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:01.460 
forward
you<00:03:59.850> can't<00:04:00.060> look<00:04:00.180> around<00:04:00.450> and<00:04:00.780> you<00:04:01.170> just<00:04:01.230> do

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:01.470 
you can't look around and you just do

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:03.260 
you can't look around and you just do
this<00:04:01.500> and<00:04:01.980> you<00:04:02.130> still<00:04:02.310> take<00:04:02.460> fall<00:04:02.640> damage<00:04:02.670> so<00:04:03.240> I

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:03.270 
this and you still take fall damage so I

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:05.690 
this and you still take fall damage so I
think<00:04:03.510> they<00:04:03.690> should<00:04:03.840> fix<00:04:04.170> that<00:04:04.310> so<00:04:05.310> hopefully

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:05.700 
think they should fix that so hopefully

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:07.430 
think they should fix that so hopefully
if<00:04:05.790> the<00:04:05.880> guy<00:04:06.000> who<00:04:06.570> makes<00:04:06.810> this<00:04:06.990> mod<00:04:07.200> is

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:07.440 
if the guy who makes this mod is

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:10.730 
if the guy who makes this mod is
watching<00:04:07.800> this<00:04:07.890> he<00:04:08.430> might<00:04:08.730> want<00:04:08.970> to<00:04:09.030> think<00:04:09.740> I'd

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:10.740 
watching this he might want to think I'd

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:12.500 
watching this he might want to think I'd
I<00:04:10.950> think<00:04:11.160> it<00:04:11.250> would<00:04:11.340> be<00:04:11.400> a<00:04:11.430> cool<00:04:11.820> idea<00:04:11.850> to<00:04:12.120> fix

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:12.510 
I think it would be a cool idea to fix

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:14.090 
I think it would be a cool idea to fix
that<00:04:12.720> because<00:04:13.170> it's<00:04:13.500> kind<00:04:13.710> of<00:04:13.740> annoying<00:04:13.980> when

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:14.100 
that because it's kind of annoying when

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:17.240 
that because it's kind of annoying when
you're<00:04:14.280> trying<00:04:14.310> to<00:04:14.510> not<00:04:15.510> dying<00:04:15.780> okay<00:04:16.160> so<00:04:17.160> now

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:19.440 
we'll use the concrete crystal crystal

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:21.949 
we'll use the concrete crystal crystal
he<00:04:19.709> do<00:04:19.830> this<00:04:19.980> you<00:04:20.220> get<00:04:20.310> clay<00:04:20.580> I<00:04:20.850> don't<00:04:21.750> know<00:04:21.810> why

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:26.180 
something get the concrete chain

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:28.970 
something get the concrete chain

the Pleader

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:34.880 
the Pleader
now<00:04:30.390> with<00:04:31.200> a<00:04:31.230> concrete<00:04:31.500> -<00:04:32.030> you<00:04:33.030> get<00:04:33.210> a<00:04:33.890> little

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:34.890 
now with a concrete - you get a little

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:38.380 
now with a concrete - you get a little
bit<00:04:34.980> of<00:04:35.070> speed<00:04:35.400> and<00:04:35.669> you<00:04:36.390> also<00:04:36.510> get<00:04:36.660> resistance

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:38.390 
bit of speed and you also get resistance

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:42.110 
bit of speed and you also get resistance
and<00:04:39.390> that<00:04:39.990> it's<00:04:40.860> not<00:04:41.010> like<00:04:41.220> super<00:04:41.520> fast<00:04:41.850> speed

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:42.120 
and that it's not like super fast speed

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:44.000 
and that it's not like super fast speed
but<00:04:42.419> it<00:04:43.080> is<00:04:43.200> a<00:04:43.230> really<00:04:43.410> good<00:04:43.620> way<00:04:43.710> to<00:04:43.770> get<00:04:43.890> out

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:44.010

but it is a really good way to get out
of<00:04:44.040> a<00:04:44.160> fight<00:04:44.190> if<00:04:44.520> you<00:04:44.610> need<00:04:44.730> to<00:04:44.850> say<00:04:45.720> ah<00:04:45.750> that's

hope<00:06:18.880> the<00:06:19.880> Creator<00:06:20.570> watches<00:06:21.200> this<00:06:21.380> I<00:06:21.620> didn't

00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:22.520 
hope the Creator watches this I didn't

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:24.190

like<00:06:22.640> him<00:06:23.060> so<00:06:23.090> much<00:06:23.240> suggestions<00:06:23.840> for<00:06:23.990> the<00:06:24.050> mod

00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:27.260 
but I don't know we'll see if he does

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:30.520 
but I don't know we'll see if he does
them<00:06:27.580> like<00:06:28.580> some<00:06:28.850> I<00:06:29.180> think<00:06:29.960> there<00:06:30.230> should<00:06:30.260> be<00:06:30.440> a

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:30.530 
them like some I think there should be a

00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:32.830 
them like some I think there should be a
little<00:06:30.740> bit<00:06:30.830> of<00:06:31.430> a<00:06:31.580> karma<00:06:31.940> system<00:06:32.300> but<00:06:32.660> I'm

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:32.840 
little bit of a karma system but I'm

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:34.600 
little bit of a karma system but I'm
weird<00:06:33.320> like<00:06:33.410> that<00:06:33.530> and<00:06:33.860> I<00:06:33.890> think<00:06:34.190> everything

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:34.610 
weird like that and I think everything

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:36.070 
weird like that and I think everything
should<00:06:34.640> be<00:06:34.820> kind<00:06:35.150> of<00:06:35.210> more<00:06:35.480> based<00:06:35.690> off<00:06:35.840> game

00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:36.080 
should be kind of more based off game

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:38.860 
should be kind of more based off game
but<00:06:36.410> yeah<00:06:36.890> but<00:06:37.670> that's<00:06:37.850> this<00:06:38.060> mod<00:06:38.240> I<00:06:38.540> actually
