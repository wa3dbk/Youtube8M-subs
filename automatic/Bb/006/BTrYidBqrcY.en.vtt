00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
well so my favorite one is obviously the

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:52.910 
well so my favorite one is obviously the
speed<00:01:51.659> boost<00:01:51.869> because<00:01:52.200> I<00:01:52.320> used<00:01:52.560> it<00:01:52.710> in<00:01:52.829> this

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
speed boost because I used it in this

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.830 
speed boost because I used it in this
one<00:01:53.070> there's<00:01:53.520> also<00:01:53.700> going<00:01:53.939> to<00:01:54.000> be<00:01:54.149> a<00:01:54.479> there's

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
one there's also going to be a there's

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.510 
one there's also going to be a there's
an<00:01:55.049> ammo<00:01:55.500> regeneration<00:01:56.159> a<00:01:56.340> health

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
an ammo regeneration a health

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.700 
an ammo regeneration a health
regeneration<00:01:56.790> and<00:01:57.329> a<00:01:57.420> damage<00:01:57.869> increase<00:01:58.140> one

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
regeneration and a damage increase one

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.499 
regeneration and a damage increase one
so<00:01:58.950> the<00:01:59.460> damage<00:01:59.670> increase<00:02:00.030> one<00:02:00.240> is<00:02:00.360> good

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
so the damage increase one is good

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:01.760 
so the damage increase one is good
especially<00:02:00.630> if<00:02:00.990> you're<00:02:01.079> like<00:02:01.200> the<00:02:01.320> siren<00:02:01.649> or

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
especially if you're like the siren or

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.499 
especially if you're like the siren or
something<00:02:02.009> like<00:02:02.100> that<00:02:02.159> or<00:02:02.520> you<00:02:03.420> know

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
something like that or you know

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:04.280 
something like that or you know
something<00:02:03.780> you<00:02:03.840> don't<00:02:03.869> have<00:02:04.079> that<00:02:04.140> much

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
something you don't have that much

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.679 
something you don't have that much
damage<00:02:04.649> on<00:02:05.009> but<00:02:05.850> I<00:02:05.880> really<00:02:06.270> like<00:02:06.390> this<00:02:06.509> one

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
damage on but I really like this one

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:07.940 
damage on but I really like this one
because<00:02:06.810> the<00:02:06.960> speed<00:02:07.170> boost<00:02:07.350> helps<00:02:07.619> out<00:02:07.740> a<00:02:07.770> lot

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
because the speed boost helps out a lot

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.410 
because the speed boost helps out a lot
and<00:02:08.069> I'm<00:02:08.160> able<00:02:08.280> to<00:02:08.429> dodge<00:02:08.670> all<00:02:08.879> the<00:02:08.910> bullets<00:02:09.270> so

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
and I'm able to dodge all the bullets so

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.720 
and I'm able to dodge all the bullets so
the<00:02:09.569> speed<00:02:09.780> it<00:02:09.989> really<00:02:10.289> ain't<00:02:10.470> helps<00:02:11.160> with

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
the speed it really ain't helps with

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.770 
the speed it really ain't helps with
anything<00:02:12.120> so<00:02:12.270> as<00:02:12.420> you<00:02:12.540> see<00:02:12.690> right<00:02:12.720> here<00:02:13.080> we're
