00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:18.380
 i 

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:20.750
 I love living in Malibu, for sure. 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:22.040
 and tell me about the dolls here that 

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:26.540
 science interests education 

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:30.980
 superior the arts all that looks at this a 

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:33.260
 spending that does breakdance that today she 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:35.900
 it's what it looks like but if we have 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:39.560
 deep thinkers in malibu sports 

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:44.149
 on television like it I do not feel my 

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:47.330
 legs people need to leave their 

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:49.460
 screens and stimulate their minds or by 

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:51.850
 at least stop seeing so many videos of 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:51.850
 cats 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.030
 if there was only one store 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.860
 food for the mind a place with 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.770
 games and toys that will teach 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:04.890
 really enough if you had to do 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:09.140
 the Malibu difference opens a spa for 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.140
 Persian pocket dogs brunilda 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:17.480
 what coincidence would surprise you what 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.480
 frequent things like that happen here 

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:29.340
 welcome friends the scientific room 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:32.180
 of grace open those 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:35.000
 [Music] 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:37.060
 well it's early I'm sure that the 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.390
 place will be full very soon 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:43.510
 [Music] 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:43.510
 I do not understand it or a customer in sight 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:49.119
 I love the new store thanks 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:51.250
 let me show you some fun 

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:54.659
 scientific toys like this 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:54.659
 glitter particle accelerator 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:59.070
 it's so educational 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:06.690
 No one here is interested in 

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:06.690
 science 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:12.010
 have had the inauguration but town 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:16.660
 and I really wanted to win the triple 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:18.490
 land're right I also am 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:20.740
 beginning to think that the malibú senses 

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:23.150
 they do not care about science 

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:27.210
 we just need to spread the word 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:30.060
 [Music] 

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:32.070

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:33.420
 number one of malibú for all the 

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:35.850
 shopping and science 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:39.750
 I'm great and if you love learning what 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:42.570
 others already join it to their own direct with 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:44.970
 the dinosaur dna chip does not 

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:48.330
 worry rex and we will make a best friend 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:49.890
 ideal for you and will have hours of 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:53.790
 fun with this mini reactor 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:56.100
 cold fusion that is also over and 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:03:00.270
 do not forget that we also have delivery 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:03.060

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:12.730
 [Music] 

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:16.450
 the commercial increased sales in a 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:18.750
 125 percent and converted to malibu in 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:21.220
 a place of science fans 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:24.330
 excellent until Rachel bought a kit 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:24.330

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:29.250
