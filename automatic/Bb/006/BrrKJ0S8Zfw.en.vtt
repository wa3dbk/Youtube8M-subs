like<00:04:34.090> a<00:04:34.180> limit<00:04:34.450> of<00:04:34.560> 15<00:04:35.560> spaces<00:04:36.010> and<00:04:36.100> it<00:04:36.220> just

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:36.400 
like a limit of 15 spaces and it just

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:38.940 
like a limit of 15 spaces and it just
makes<00:04:36.580> that<00:04:36.820> one<00:04:36.940> right<00:04:37.030> there<00:04:37.270> and<00:04:37.870> it<00:04:38.770> does

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:38.950 
makes that one right there and it does

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:45.840 
makes that one right there and it does
not<00:04:39.130> continue<00:04:39.820> and<00:04:40.240> change<00:04:40.990> that<00:04:41.170> one

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:45.850 

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:54.850 

but<00:04:46.850> then<00:04:49.420> change<00:04:50.420> them<00:04:50.860> the<00:04:51.860> third<00:04:52.460> one<00:04:53.860> you

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:54.860 
but then change them the third one you

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:58.360 
but then change them the third one you
can<00:04:54.980> tell<00:04:55.190> it<00:04:55.600> changes<00:04:56.600> the<00:04:57.500> first<00:04:57.770> only<00:04:58.190> the

00:04:58.360 --> 00:04:58.370 
can tell it changes the first only the

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:01.080 
can tell it changes the first only the
first<00:04:58.580> one<00:04:58.760> but<00:04:58.880> also<00:04:59.030> the<00:04:59.210> second<00:04:59.600> one

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:01.090 
first one but also the second one

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:03.790 
first one but also the second one
continues<00:05:02.090> to<00:05:02.240> go<00:05:02.390> through<00:05:02.690> the<00:05:03.350> redstone

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:03.800 
continues to go through the redstone

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:06.250 
continues to go through the redstone
repeater<00:05:04.130> just<00:05:04.910> makes<00:05:05.090> it<00:05:05.240> this<00:05:05.840> is<00:05:05.990> kind<00:05:06.200> of

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:06.260 
repeater just makes it this is kind of

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:09.400 
repeater just makes it this is kind of
kind<00:05:06.980> of<00:05:07.100> add<00:05:07.160> to<00:05:07.190> make<00:05:07.400> it<00:05:07.550> a<00:05:07.670> just<00:05:08.480> right<00:05:08.690> it's

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:09.410 
kind of add to make it a just right it's

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:11.980 
kind of add to make it a just right it's
not<00:05:09.530> really<00:05:09.860> a<00:05:10.330> you<00:05:11.330> know<00:05:11.420> thing<00:05:11.630> that<00:05:11.780> you<00:05:11.840> can

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:11.990 
not really a you know thing that you can

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:13.630 
not really a you know thing that you can
just<00:05:12.110> slap<00:05:12.770> down<00:05:12.950> you<00:05:13.160> have<00:05:13.220> to<00:05:13.340> make<00:05:13.460> sure<00:05:13.490> you

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:13.640 
just slap down you have to make sure you

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:15.460 
just slap down you have to make sure you
get<00:05:13.820> all<00:05:13.940> the<00:05:13.970> redstone<00:05:14.390> to<00:05:14.990> make<00:05:15.140> sure<00:05:15.290> it's

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:15.470 
get all the redstone to make sure it's

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:18.010 
get all the redstone to make sure it's
all<00:05:15.620> perfect<00:05:16.220> and<00:05:16.310> everything<00:05:16.550> and<00:05:16.870> you<00:05:17.870> could

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:18.020 
all perfect and everything and you could

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:20.710 
all perfect and everything and you could
tell<00:05:18.170> both<00:05:18.350> tracks<00:05:18.770> are<00:05:18.920> changed<00:05:19.570> over<00:05:20.570> there

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:20.720 
tell both tracks are changed over there

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:27.010 
tell both tracks are changed over there
and<00:05:20.930> over<00:05:20.960> here<00:05:23.650> um<00:05:25.270> the<00:05:26.270> fourth<00:05:26.540> one<00:05:26.750> I<00:05:26.780> have

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:27.020 
and over here um the fourth one I have

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:28.720 
and over here um the fourth one I have
not<00:05:27.170> added<00:05:27.470> yet<00:05:27.650> or<00:05:28.070> the<00:05:28.250> fifth<00:05:28.430> one<00:05:28.550> of<00:05:28.670> the

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:28.730 
not added yet or the fifth one of the

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:31.060 
not added yet or the fifth one of the
six<00:05:28.940> 1<00:05:29.120> i'm<00:05:29.990> going<00:05:30.050> to<00:05:30.380> be<00:05:30.530> planning<00:05:31.040> to

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:31.070 
six 1 i'm going to be planning to

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:38.629 
six 1 i'm going to be planning to
hopefully<00:05:31.340> change<00:05:32.090> make<00:05:32.450> that<00:05:32.660> soon<00:05:32.990> not<00:05:33.770> sure

00:05:38.629 --> 00:05:38.639 

00:05:38.639 --> 00:05:40.580 

it's<00:05:39.270> pretty<00:05:39.599> much<00:05:39.780> for<00:05:40.050> the<00:05:40.110> underground

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:40.590 
it's pretty much for the underground

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:43.689 
it's pretty much for the underground
part<00:05:41.539> just<00:05:42.539> kind<00:05:42.749> of<00:05:42.780> give<00:05:42.930> you<00:05:43.020> a<00:05:43.080> little

00:05:43.689 --> 00:05:43.699 
part just kind of give you a little

00:05:43.699 --> 00:05:47.959 
part just kind of give you a little
visual<00:05:44.870> overlook<00:05:45.870> and<00:05:46.669> basically<00:05:47.669> this<00:05:47.819> is

00:05:47.959 --> 00:05:47.969 
visual overlook and basically this is

00:05:47.969 --> 00:05:49.010 
visual overlook and basically this is
all<00:05:48.060> you<00:05:48.150> want<00:05:48.300> to<00:05:48.360> make<00:05:48.479> it<00:05:48.629> pretty<00:05:48.840> much

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:49.020 
all you want to make it pretty much

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:52.040 
all you want to make it pretty much
pretty<00:05:49.560> much<00:05:49.680> exactly<00:05:50.099> like<00:05:50.340> this<00:05:50.789> or<00:05:51.749> may<00:05:52.020> not

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:52.050 
pretty much exactly like this or may not

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:55.869 
pretty much exactly like this or may not
work<00:05:52.289> oh<00:05:53.180> yeah<00:05:54.180> and<00:05:54.210> if<00:05:54.360> you're<00:05:54.389> wondering

00:05:55.869 --> 00:05:55.879 
work oh yeah and if you're wondering

00:05:55.879 --> 00:05:58.249 
work oh yeah and if you're wondering
where<00:05:56.879> the<00:05:56.969> red<00:05:57.090> stone<00:05:57.300> works<00:05:57.539> it's<00:05:57.810> just<00:05:57.900> you

00:05:58.249 --> 00:05:58.259 
where the red stone works it's just you

00:05:58.259 --> 00:06:00.080 
where the red stone works it's just you
know<00:05:58.409> goes<00:05:58.919> right<00:05:59.099> up<00:05:59.219> there<00:05:59.370> and<00:05:59.520> it's<00:05:59.849> that

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:00.090 
know goes right up there and it's that

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:08.529 
know goes right up there and it's that
one<00:06:00.800> not<00:06:01.800> too<00:06:02.009> much<00:06:02.159> not<00:06:02.520> too<00:06:03.270> hard<00:06:03.659> to<00:06:03.719> take<00:06:04.319> in

00:06:08.529 --> 00:06:08.539 

00:06:08.539 --> 00:06:18.309 

if<00:06:09.539> we<00:06:09.749> go<00:06:09.870> up<00:06:09.990> here<00:06:11.180> show<00:06:12.180> you<00:06:12.270> one<00:06:12.389> more<00:06:12.419> thing

00:06:18.309 --> 00:06:18.319 

00:06:18.319 --> 00:06:21.019 

this<00:06:19.319> is<00:06:19.560> the<00:06:19.740> button<00:06:20.069> for<00:06:20.279> the<00:06:20.400> first<00:06:20.639> one<00:06:20.849> and

00:06:21.019 --> 00:06:21.029 
this is the button for the first one and

00:06:21.029 --> 00:06:23.709 
this is the button for the first one and
you<00:06:21.300> can<00:06:21.419> see<00:06:21.539> the<00:06:21.569> red<00:06:21.810> stone<00:06:22.050> goes<00:06:22.860> up<00:06:23.069> here

00:06:23.709 --> 00:06:23.719 
you can see the red stone goes up here

00:06:23.719 --> 00:06:26.570 
you can see the red stone goes up here
goes<00:06:24.719> connects<00:06:25.139> to<00:06:25.319> the<00:06:25.439> the<00:06:26.039> block<00:06:26.250> under<00:06:26.460> it

00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:26.580 
goes connects to the the block under it

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:30.829 
goes connects to the the block under it
and<00:06:26.789> it<00:06:27.000> still<00:06:27.500> makes<00:06:28.500> the<00:06:28.819> piston<00:06:29.819> go<00:06:30.000> the

00:06:30.829 --> 00:06:30.839 
and it still makes the piston go the

00:06:30.839 --> 00:06:37.610 
and it still makes the piston go the
piston<00:06:31.169> pushes<00:06:31.289> it<00:06:31.589> down<00:06:31.710> goes<00:06:32.669> in<00:06:36.529> also<00:06:37.529> for

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:37.620 
piston pushes it down goes in also for

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:40.969 
piston pushes it down goes in also for
the<00:06:37.740> second<00:06:38.039> one<00:06:38.249> the<00:06:38.699> piston<00:06:38.999> does<00:06:39.180> it<00:06:39.979> of

00:06:40.969 --> 00:06:40.979 
the second one the piston does it of

00:06:40.979 --> 00:06:43.249 
the second one the piston does it of
course<00:06:41.330> the<00:06:42.330> second<00:06:42.659> one<00:06:42.750> actually<00:06:43.050> I<00:06:43.080> to<00:06:43.139> use

00:06:43.249 --> 00:06:43.259 
course the second one actually I to use

00:06:43.259 --> 00:06:45.529 
course the second one actually I to use
a<00:06:43.289> redstone<00:06:43.589> repeater<00:06:43.949> because<00:06:44.310> it<00:06:45.120> would<00:06:45.330> not

00:06:45.529 --> 00:06:45.539 
a redstone repeater because it would not

00:06:45.539 --> 00:06:47.240 
a redstone repeater because it would not
make<00:06:45.779> it<00:06:45.990> completely<00:06:46.379> because<00:06:46.710> you<00:06:46.949> know<00:06:47.069> the

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:47.250 
make it completely because you know the

00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:49.730 
make it completely because you know the
15<00:06:47.819> redstone<00:06:48.509> limit<00:06:48.839> I'm<00:06:49.259> pretty<00:06:49.469> sure<00:06:49.650> you

00:06:49.730 --> 00:06:49.740 
15 redstone limit I'm pretty sure you

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:52.189 
15 redstone limit I'm pretty sure you
would<00:06:49.830> know<00:06:49.949> that<00:06:49.979> already<00:06:50.870> same<00:06:51.870> thing<00:06:52.080> for

00:06:52.189 --> 00:06:52.199 
would know that already same thing for

00:06:52.199 --> 00:06:55.129 
would know that already same thing for
the<00:06:52.259> third<00:06:52.469> one<00:06:53.389> the<00:06:54.389> fourth<00:06:54.659> one<00:06:54.839> is<00:06:54.990> still

00:06:55.129 --> 00:06:55.139 
the third one the fourth one is still

00:06:55.139 --> 00:06:57.950 
the third one the fourth one is still
being<00:06:55.289> added<00:06:55.589> of<00:06:55.800> course<00:06:56.330> but<00:06:57.330> it's<00:06:57.750> still

00:06:57.950 --> 00:06:57.960 
being added of course but it's still

00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:00.679 
being added of course but it's still
almost<00:06:58.949> done<00:06:59.279> just<00:07:00.000> got<00:07:00.089> to<00:07:00.180> add<00:07:00.270> some<00:07:00.449> tracks

00:07:00.679 --> 00:07:00.689 
almost done just got to add some tracks

00:07:00.689 --> 00:07:03.230 
almost done just got to add some tracks
in<00:07:00.839> the<00:07:00.930> piston<00:07:01.460> we<00:07:02.460> got<00:07:02.610> the<00:07:02.669> redstone<00:07:03.029> part

00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:03.240 
in the piston we got the redstone part

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:06.580 
in the piston we got the redstone part
of<00:07:03.360> it
