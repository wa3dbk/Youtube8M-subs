00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:08.660
 hello guys or girls welcome to 

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:09.950
 apple 5 x 1 in this video I bring you one 

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:12.950
 tool that will allow us 

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:15.589
 recover all the files that we have 

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:18.230
 could be erased by mistake or by some 

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:21.079
 inconvenience of our team ios 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:22.880
 agreement this this program you are going to 

00:00:21.079 --> 00:00:24.079
 can find on this website in the 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:25.970
 that I am right now that I am going to 

00:00:24.079 --> 00:00:28.610
 leave in the description and I say we're going 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:31.099
 to allow to be able to recover for example 

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:35.150
 call history messages 

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:36.680
 deleted photos we have good years 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:37.820
 I will teach directly in what 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:40.970
 consists 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:43.460
 without further ado beating around finally this 

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:45.710
 is form rescue according to this program 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:48.140
 allows us three ways to recover from 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:49.700
 files from the icloud cloud from 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:52.700
 a backup that we have in 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:55.460
 this case for example in our in 

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:56.870
 our computer and then from the 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:57.920
 own device once we connect it 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:00.440
 via usb 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:02.180
 I'm going to agree here and I 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:04.460
 you can select what type of files 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:06.200
 I want him to recover in agreement between 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:07.580
 contacts that you could erase or have 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:10.010
 could lose 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:13.250
 safari data for calls messages 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:14.930
 messages attached in order all this that 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:17.230
 you are seeing here in agreement is very 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:19.160
 easy we can go dialing or 

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:21.470
 unmarking depending on what 

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:23.300
 we want or not to recover, I'm going 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:25.040
 example to want to recover some 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:26.690
 certain notes it's worth that I've 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:29.180
 deleted in agreement and I will try 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:31.010
 recover from here then so I 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:32.630
 would uncheck all this if I just 

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:34.340
 That would also make him the best 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:35.720
 I can recover or I want to recover photos 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:38.390
 I have here because nothing left him 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:39.950
 marked good but to streamline the 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:41.210
 video and that is not too long because the 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:43.640
 scan by logically carries a 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:45.080
 I'm going to optimize a little bit 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:47.330
 the whole search so that only me 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:49.670
 find what refers to the notes 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:52.700
 so he unchecked all this and I give him 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:54.170
 here to start scan it automatically goes 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:56.540
 to try to search my information 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:58.100
 personal on my phone is the records 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:00.440
 of the notes that I could erase 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:03.530
 We will go back once before 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:05.540
 finish the percentage of loading good 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:06.860
 guys have already finished loading this 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:09.440
 here you are seeing that he has recovered 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:12.739
 three notes and there are all three notes that 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:14.180
 I had here agree then good as 

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:17.239
 you are watching here we can choose 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:18.799
 we want to see them see them all see only 

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:21.530
 those that are deleted or see the 

00:02:18.799 --> 00:02:23.150
 existing good and here's the rope 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:25.510
 so I just had to give it 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:27.980
 to the recovery button is valid to be able 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:29.540
 retrieve it then here we have 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:33.230
 different options to be able 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:35.389
 customize the type of extension in the 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:37.519
 that we want for example to export and 

00:02:35.389 --> 00:02:38.329
 where we want to export all this from 

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:40.489
 agreement because we also 

00:02:38.329 --> 00:02:42.230
 We could export in certain 

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:43.609
 formats what we are going to recover from 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:44.989
 our team and save it in our 

00:02:43.609 --> 00:02:48.260
 computer for the future according 

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:49.579
 let's go back and as I say also 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:52.250
 we could do it from copies of 

00:02:49.579 --> 00:02:54.500
 icloud security sorry for icloud and 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:56.090
 of itunes is as I say in the 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:58.010
 description is to leave this software me 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:01.730
 it seems very very useful that's why I bring it to 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:03.139
 this channel more than anything because it would not be 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:04.549
 the first time it has happened to us that 

00:03:03.139 --> 00:03:06.680
 we have deleted, we have lost some 

00:03:04.549 --> 00:03:08.780
 file that we would later like to recover 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:10.549
 At some point it comes to me 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:12.919
 example to the david head recently 

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:14.329
 had a problem with the photos of his 

00:03:12.919 --> 00:03:16.909
 woman some pictures of work very 

00:03:14.329 --> 00:03:18.829
 important is that he lost and with a 

00:03:16.909 --> 00:03:20.960
 program of this type as font risk that 

00:03:18.829 --> 00:03:23.030
 he was able to recover them 

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:25.280
 guys here I leave it in the description 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:27.650
 all the data and for my part nothing else 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:29.720
 guys for me this is all to give 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:32.030
 a like it has liked and we see ourselves in a 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:33.920
 next video here in apple 5 x 1 because 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:36.250
 you know that they and fernando and I promise 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:36.250
 do what
