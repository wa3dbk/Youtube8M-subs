hi<00:00:01.050> Jeff<00:00:01.319> here<00:00:01.469> with<00:00:01.620> Corsair<00:00:02.100> I'm<00:00:02.700> going<00:00:02.820> to

00:00:02.869 --> 00:00:02.879 
hi Jeff here with Corsair I'm going to

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:04.640 
hi Jeff here with Corsair I'm going to
build<00:00:03.030> a<00:00:03.090> system<00:00:03.389> using<00:00:03.570> the<00:00:03.750> Corsair<00:00:04.200> Carbide

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:04.650 
build a system using the Corsair Carbide

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:07.369 
build a system using the Corsair Carbide
series<00:00:05.100> 400<00:00:05.640> our<00:00:05.759> case<00:00:06.029> it's<00:00:06.930> a<00:00:07.020> mid<00:00:07.200> tower

00:00:07.369 --> 00:00:07.379 
series 400 our case it's a mid tower

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:08.960 
series 400 our case it's a mid tower
case<00:00:07.500> but<00:00:07.950> it<00:00:08.010> has<00:00:08.099> a<00:00:08.130> lot<00:00:08.340> of<00:00:08.370> internal<00:00:08.760> volume

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:08.970 
case but it has a lot of internal volume

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:10.190 
case but it has a lot of internal volume
so<00:00:09.480> we're<00:00:09.570> going<00:00:09.660> to<00:00:09.750> take<00:00:09.870> the<00:00:09.990> opportunity

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200 
so we're going to take the opportunity

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.339 
so we're going to take the opportunity
to<00:00:10.800> fill<00:00:10.980> it<00:00:11.099> with<00:00:11.219> some<00:00:11.370> large<00:00:11.580> components

00:00:12.339 --> 00:00:12.349 
to fill it with some large components

00:00:12.349 --> 00:00:15.350 
to fill it with some large components
400<00:00:13.349> are<00:00:13.469> also<00:00:13.650> has<00:00:13.950> superior<00:00:14.490> airflow<00:00:15.030> with

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
400 are also has superior airflow with
