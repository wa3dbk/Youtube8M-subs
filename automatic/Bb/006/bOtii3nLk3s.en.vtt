00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:07.170
 Hello, my name is Jannik and today I want to demonstrate to you, like Cortana 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:10.900
 or the search box can be removed from the taskbar. 

00:00:11.149 --> 00:00:14.550
 Cortana is a language assistant programmed by Microsoft 

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:17.600
 and should facilitate the everyday life of people depending on the situation. 

00:00:17.939 --> 00:00:21.720
 Cortana creates appointments or reminders through voice input, 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.329
 searches the Internet for desired information 

00:00:24.329 --> 00:00:28.329
 or stores user's interests and preferences locally on the device, 

00:00:28.329 --> 00:00:31.500
 for example, to display current messages user-related. 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:37.390
 The software service will be steadily expanded and will be extended in the future with additional functions. 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:42.800
 Microsoft's Cortana comes with Windows 10, in addition to Windows Phone 8.1 and Windows 10 Mobile, 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.400
 Now also available on desktop systems. 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.700
 Among other things, it is located on the taskbar and can be called from there. 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.020
 Those who do not use Cortana on their desktop system 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:57.820
 or you want to use the space on your taskbar instead, 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:01.800
 can partially or completely remove the language assistant. 

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:07.600
 To customize Cortana's appearance on the taskbar, 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:12.100
 must first be right-clicked on a free space on the taskbar. 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:17.400
 Then a menu will appear, in which we point with the mouse pointer to the entry "Cortana". 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:21.159
 Now there are three options available, which differ in appearance 

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:24.150
 Cortana on the taskbar. 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.250
 "Show Search Box" represents the default setting. 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:31.500
 The Cortana search box is fully visible, as is the microphone icon. 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.700
 This option requires the most space on the taskbar. 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:41.300
 The "Show Cortana Icon" setting is a space-saving compromise for Cortana on the taskbar. 

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:47.300
 The search box and the microphone icon are removed, but the typical Cortanas symbol remains 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:50.700
 about which the language assistant can still be called. 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:02:00.890
 The last option "Hide" removes Cortana completely from the taskbar. 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:04.490
 There is no search box and no icon available. 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.100
 The vacated space can now be used again without restriction. 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:12.600
 Cortana can still be started from the app tile if needed. 

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:18.800
 Should changes in Cortana's presentation be desired at a later date, 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:23.689
 can be done at any time with a right click on the taskbar via the menu.
