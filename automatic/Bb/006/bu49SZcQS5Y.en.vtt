00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:28.730
 good guys who are standing today as branches and 

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:31.520
 today we are going to see the map of one of my 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:33.350
 dear subscribers that is the green 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:35.059
 duch who is with his friend the onion 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:37.160
 who also cooperated a lot in this 

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:38.449
 map and we will teach the 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:40.390
 constructions that has but what 

00:00:38.449 --> 00:00:42.980
 main thing is that you see that mill 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:46.790
 giant you can see that it passes over 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:49.820
 the clouds your huge mill that the truth 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:51.920
 that caught my attention is a model of 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:52.820
 mill other than normal is not the 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:54.949
 typical that can be found by 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:58.190
 example here in Spain in a place of the 

00:00:54.949 --> 00:00:59.420
 stain but good is a construction 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:01.339
 which is quite curious then I wanted 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:06.290
 share with you right now we 

00:01:01.339 --> 00:01:08.720
 we found on a floating island that 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:10.370
 It is in the air built by him 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:12.440
 green duch 

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:13.790
 the truth that good is pretty good 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:15.260
 It's a good enough construction 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:18.110
 curious what happens that tells me not to 

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:20.930
 he is born grass does not know the reason but 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:22.280
 well let's do a somersault 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:24.260
 there I am the day that still gives me a 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:26.260
 little bit of vertigo there we have our 

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:30.260
 friend the pig that always accompanies us 

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:33.170
 and nothing we will see in the first place what 

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:35.720
 that is the mill inside is 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:38.250
 built as you see for the most part 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:41.370
 with obsidian what 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:43.830
 in my opinion it is a construction that 

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:46.560
 Well, it can look pretty because it's a 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:48.720
 black color with let's say you have ones 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.990
 pretty significant details of the 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:53.340
 city ​​but it is quite laborious to me 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.350
 I do not like to build with obsidian 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.240
 very big buildings because for now 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:00.930
 It's like you're wrong in a 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:02.460
 single stone say in a single block you 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:05.310
 brings about that bitterness because the 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:08.250
 chop it has a time that for me is 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:09.810
 excessive then I try to ignore the 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.160
 build known but good the truth 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:14.610
 it's pretty good that you're there 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:17.100
 below has what is your portal of the 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:20.400
 hell and he has as is he told me that 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:21.989
 It is a central lava lamp that 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:24.420
 traverses from top to bottom 

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:25.770
 totally what is the mill of 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.910
 moment has not decorated inside 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:29.070
 because the truth is that I have it 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:31.850
 time what is the right outside 

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:35.340
 you see this room is amazing 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:36.480
 all all all full of lava the 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:38.640
 truth that it looks pretty good 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:41.040
 contrast to the black 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:43.230
 and black obsidian that pretty 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:44.340
 well that contrast and good that takes you 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:46.500
 totally from top to bottom 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:48.510
 good as it is quite long enough 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:50.910
 let's say let's cut there is a little 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:54.230
 video this is the beginning is the start 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:58.290
 of the most higher part you have of the 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:59.760
 mill and well let's go down to see 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:02.340
 other constructions that have to 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:04.190
 they're pretty good so I do not hit 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:06.660
 that we see black no no I do not see it well 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:09.150
 be a little bit I'm a bit accelerated 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:11.090
 but well let's get out of the mill 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:14.430
 let's see the rest of the world that has 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:18.040
 has built there likewise is 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:20.530
 he built shouted in giant size 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:22.120
 his doll in a huge size the 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:25.359
 truth that as you see now that comes by 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:27.250
 here it looks like it's the same and nothing 

00:03:25.359 --> 00:03:29.349
 let's see again the other area of the map that 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:31.480
 have you have contrast has a lot of 

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:33.040
 things but good the truth that what good 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:34.239
 it's one in a rotation curious people 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:36.220
 we cross the wooden bridge that is 

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:38.230
 pretty well we came to a church that 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:41.379
 it's good in the construction phase 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:43.900
 still but good is one is a project 

00:03:41.379 --> 00:03:45.220
 of church that has and we will go now 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:47.980
 good tonight doing but let's 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:50.560
 go up to this tower to see from afar 

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:54.340
 both that which is the floating island as 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:55.930
 the mill is worth so that you of them 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:58.989
 you realize the magnitude of the 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:04:00.760
 build the truth that tells me that 

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:03.400
 it took a long time 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:05.530
 a lot with this map is already with the help 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:07.260
 from apart from other onion people 

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:08.790
 that was already beside me 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:10.920
 and how good I have had some 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:12.239
 mistake what I said before to 

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:13.829
 place the obsidian what has 

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:15.989
 delayed enough in construction 

00:04:13.829 --> 00:04:18.000
 but he says he wants to expand 

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:19.859
 much more the map to do with some 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.299
 much more amazing constructions and 

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:23.639
 then no longer swallows a little more 

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:25.860
 forward good let's do that to 

00:04:23.639 --> 00:04:27.900
 move forward a little bit and we have slept not 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:29.280
 we are neat wash our teeth and so on 

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:31.440
 etcetera and now for what I wanted 

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:33.840
 to teach you is there is what is the 

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:34.910
 doll green tuc the giant that was made 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:36.660
 that the truth that he has been 

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:39.270
 fantastic I think that has been 

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:40.860
 fantastic there are you see the mill and what 

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:44.400
 was next is a style I do not know 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:45.960
 call him joe or a transformer you see 

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:48.180
 from there the truth that is also very 

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:50.100
 great it looks great and nothing there 

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:53.400
 we have the three who joined in the end 

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:57.150

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:05.220
 tomorrow when it has grown much more 

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:07.770
 on this map we will teach it and nothing else 

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:10.529
