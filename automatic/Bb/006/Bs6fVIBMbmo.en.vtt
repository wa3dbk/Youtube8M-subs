incredible ancient most likely pre-inca
you<00:01:13.020> can<00:01:13.170> see<00:01:13.350> it's<00:01:13.500> not<00:01:13.620> the<00:01:13.770> easiest<00:01:14.160> place

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
you can see it's not the easiest place

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.600 
you can see it's not the easiest place
to<00:01:14.490> get<00:01:14.729> to<00:01:15.290> but<00:01:16.290> it's<00:01:16.500> well<00:01:16.680> worth<00:01:16.920> the<00:01:16.950> effort

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
to get to but it's well worth the effort

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.520 
to get to but it's well worth the effort
this<00:01:18.479> little<00:01:18.720> aqueduct<00:01:20.119> follows<00:01:21.500> the<00:01:22.500> ancient

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
this little aqueduct follows the ancient

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.820 
this little aqueduct follows the ancient
Inca<00:01:23.310> Trail<00:01:23.550> were<00:01:23.820> on<00:01:24.290> and<00:01:25.290> it's<00:01:25.440> something

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
Inca Trail were on and it's something

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:31.340 
Inca Trail were on and it's something
that<00:01:25.979> the<00:01:26.100> Inca<00:01:26.400> did<00:01:26.900> wherever<00:01:27.900> possible<00:01:30.350> so

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
that the Inca did wherever possible so

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.350 
that the Inca did wherever possible so
then<00:01:31.530> it's<00:01:31.710> down<00:01:31.950> this<00:01:32.700> little<00:01:33.180> Inca<00:01:33.600> Trail

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:35.360 
then it's down this little Inca Trail

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:39.440 
then it's down this little Inca Trail
and<00:01:36.360> then<00:01:36.540> below<00:01:37.340> that's<00:01:38.340> an<00:01:38.610> ancient<00:01:38.820> Inca

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
and then below that's an ancient Inca

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:52.120 
and then below that's an ancient Inca
Trail

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:52.130 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:02:18.110 

and<00:01:52.430> around<00:01:52.970> this<00:01:53.180> corner<00:01:54.130> is<00:01:55.130> the<00:01:55.490> cave

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.300 

so<00:02:18.629> now<00:02:19.019> actually<00:02:19.290> we're<00:02:19.620> high<00:02:19.769> above<00:02:20.129> the

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
so now actually we're high above the

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:22.880 
so now actually we're high above the
cave<00:02:20.750> because<00:02:21.750> we're<00:02:22.140> entering<00:02:22.500> from<00:02:22.739> the

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
cave because we're entering from the

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:26.920 
cave because we're entering from the
other<00:02:23.040> side<00:02:23.370> and<00:02:24.260> here<00:02:25.260> if<00:02:26.040> you<00:02:26.099> look<00:02:26.280> closely

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:26.930 
other side and here if you look closely

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:32.059 
other side and here if you look closely
you<00:02:27.930> can<00:02:28.110> see<00:02:28.519> how<00:02:29.519> the<00:02:29.580> bedrock<00:02:30.330> is<00:02:31.319> enhanced

00:02:32.059 --> 00:02:32.069 
you can see how the bedrock is enhanced

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:37.100 
you can see how the bedrock is enhanced
with<00:02:32.550> inca<00:02:33.300> work<00:02:33.690> those<00:02:34.590> cube<00:02:35.040> stones<00:02:35.750> are<00:02:36.750> the

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
with inca work those cube stones are the

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:39.740 
with inca work those cube stones are the

here you see the inca stonework and as i
pull<00:02:44.580> back<00:02:44.819> with<00:02:45.000> the<00:02:45.060> zoom

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:53.180 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:03:02.050 

the<00:02:53.659> entrance<00:02:54.319> to<00:02:54.819> the<00:02:55.819> massive<00:02:56.299> cave<00:03:00.790> this<00:03:01.790> is

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.060 
the entrance to the massive cave this is

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:05.039 
the entrance to the massive cave this is
an<00:03:02.330> inca<00:03:02.720> site<00:03:02.989> but<00:03:03.349> it's<00:03:03.470> been<00:03:03.650> so<00:03:03.860> heavily

00:03:05.039 --> 00:03:05.049 
an inca site but it's been so heavily

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:07.600 
an inca site but it's been so heavily
recycled<00:03:06.049> the<00:03:06.230> stone<00:03:06.440> walls<00:03:06.769> have<00:03:07.040> been<00:03:07.190> taken

00:03:17.619 --> 00:03:17.629 
five hundred years what this finally is

00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:31.059 
five hundred years what this finally is
the<00:03:17.840> entrance<00:03:18.349> to<00:03:19.310> this<00:03:19.459> quite<00:03:19.849> massive<00:03:20.739> cave

00:03:31.059 --> 00:03:31.069 

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:34.550 

the<00:03:31.430> cave<00:03:31.700> entrance<00:03:31.879> is<00:03:32.870> here

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560 
the cave entrance is here

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:39.530 
the cave entrance is here
and<00:03:35.040> then<00:03:35.190> the<00:03:35.340> actual<00:03:35.700> cave<00:03:35.910> itself<00:03:38.540> over

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:39.540 
and then the actual cave itself over

and then the actual cave itself over
here

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:44.360 

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:47.290 

I<00:03:44.390> don't<00:03:45.050> think<00:03:45.140> you<00:03:45.350> get<00:03:45.560> the<00:03:45.940> magnitude<00:03:46.940> of

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:47.300 
I don't think you get the magnitude of

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:50.260 
I don't think you get the magnitude of
the<00:03:48.290> scale<00:03:48.620> of<00:03:48.980> it<00:03:49.130> but<00:03:49.910> I'll<00:03:50.030> show<00:03:50.210> you

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:50.270 
the scale of it but I'll show you

00:03:50.270 --> 00:04:04.610 
the scale of it but I'll show you
because<00:03:50.690> I'll<00:03:50.960> go<00:03:51.110> deeper<00:03:51.470> in

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:04.620 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:06.589 

and<00:04:05.099> now<00:04:05.280> I'm<00:04:05.550> more<00:04:05.790> or<00:04:05.910> less<00:04:05.970> at<00:04:06.239> the<00:04:06.269> back

00:04:06.589 --> 00:04:06.599 
and now I'm more or less at the back

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:11.390 
and now I'm more or less at the back
wall<00:04:07.640> but<00:04:08.640> it's<00:04:08.819> not<00:04:09.030> simply<00:04:09.870> a<00:04:10.319> wall<00:04:11.160> that

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:11.400 
wall but it's not simply a wall that

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:14.300 
wall but it's not simply a wall that
ends<00:04:11.870> the<00:04:12.870> stream<00:04:13.260> and<00:04:13.620> the<00:04:13.800> tunnel<00:04:14.220> will

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:14.310 
ends the stream and the tunnel will

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:16.310 
ends the stream and the tunnel will
continue<00:04:14.879> that<00:04:15.150> way<00:04:15.209> you<00:04:15.480> might<00:04:15.870> be<00:04:15.930> able<00:04:16.109> to

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:16.320 
continue that way you might be able to

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:19.009 
continue that way you might be able to
