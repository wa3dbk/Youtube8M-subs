00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.750
 hello to you konstantin shaburov and 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:05.850
 youtube brain channel and today we talk about 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:08.639
 snowballs but not about the usual snowballs and snowballs 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.260
 for $ 100 or is my microphone blu 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:12.090
 snowball ice that is perfect 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.860
 for recording podcasts in computer games 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:21.180
 just to talk on skype so 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:22.710
 We look and here and set delivery 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.240
 big enough colorful box 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.269
 tripod instruction 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.619
 cable and the microphone itself cable 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:30.810
 about a meter long enough 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:33.149
 eighty performed very qualitatively in 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.670
 so thick transparent braids inside 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:38.309
 There is a metal braid so what 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.320
 unlikely to tear the landing are made of 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.899
 plastic with rubber feet which 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.430
 confidently stand on the table she 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:46.860
 don't go anywhere and neither will 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.420
 scratch the surfaces here itself 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.760
 microphone case is made of plastic 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.949
 blu company logo also 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.730
 there is a metal mesh which 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.860
 there is also behind 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:59.280
 there are no switches on it here 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:02.640
 we have access to tripod socket 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.870
 also this is one caps microphone microphone 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.309
 diode directivity that is 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.220
 accordingly, the sound is recorded only 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:10.890
 front and rear mesh is made for 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:13.010
 beauty is also a microphone enough 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.150
 weighty and look unique and 

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:17.310
 solid enough so if you where 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.890
 you will record the sound in the cafe you 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.810
 will also attract attention 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:25.460
 put a microphone and a tripod we will see 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:27.540
 that you can adjust the angle 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:30.810
 also the microphone goes small 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:33.590
 instruction where there is an installation advice 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:37.650
 also some small writing tips 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:39.180
 podcasts and music so now let's 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.350
 test sound quality quality 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.329
 recording this microphone now 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:45.000
 directly sound is written through our 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:46.680
 snow through the microphone showed me the sound 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.090
 very good you can write 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.399
 enough quality podcasts 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.140
 computer games just chat by 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:54.899
 Internet via skype with very good 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:57.090
 sound but it seemed to me that for this 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:59.939
 a microphone would be good to use 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:02.280
 podcast pop filter turns out more 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:04.020
 clean let's read you the creation 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.810
 without filters with filter and you will see 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.009
 the difference if you see once 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:11.300
 cold winter 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:13.700
 I came out of the forest was a bitter cold 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:16.610
 once in a cold winter time i am from the forest 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:18.260
 there was a bitter cold it seemed to me 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:20.630
 sound better quality under the filter but 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:22.100
 this is purely my subjective opinion now 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:24.500
 let's come to the pros to the cons to 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:27.140
 I would like to attribute very good points 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:29.030
 high quality audio is available 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:31.280
 stand not to all the microphone of this 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:33.290
 class go coasters nice long 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:35.510
 sturdy cable that is unlikely to break 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:37.160
 very simple installation you do not need 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:39.530
 no software no 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:41.750
 drivers just stuck and he writes 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:44.360
 and a good price for a microphone of this 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:46.460
 a class of this level to the minuses would like 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:48.560
 attributed but these are not quite such cons 

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:50.960
 cons still seems to need me 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:52.310
 pop filter then he has a plastic 

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:55.700
 body would like a body metal 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:57.050
 but it will be a different price and he only 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:58.220
 the diode corrector is directed accordingly 

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:00.380
 microphone for one person if you 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:01.190
 want to do some kind of interview or 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:03.920
 conference 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:05.540
 This microphone doesn't suit you at all. 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:07.220
 whole aggregate cool if budget 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:10.670
 lets advise taking it 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:12.140
 and what else but leave your opinions in 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:14.690
 comments about the microphone 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:18.400
 on this me all with you was constantin and 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:18.400
 channel youtube brain all good bye
