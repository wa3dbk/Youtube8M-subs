00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
gonna use this plate here these plates

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.280 
gonna use this plate here these plates
have<00:00:36.030> rivets<00:00:36.480> on<00:00:36.630> them<00:00:36.780> and<00:00:36.960> they're

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
have rivets on them and they're

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.350 
have rivets on them and they're
extremely<00:00:37.739> simple<00:00:38.190> to<00:00:38.219> push<00:00:38.489> out<00:00:38.730> I<00:00:38.940> just<00:00:39.180> used

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
extremely simple to push out I just used

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.750 
extremely simple to push out I just used
a<00:00:39.450> pin<00:00:39.660> punch<00:00:39.870> and<00:00:40.230> their<00:00:40.320> twist<00:00:40.620> rivets<00:00:41.040> take

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
a pin punch and their twist rivets take

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.220 
a pin punch and their twist rivets take
a<00:00:41.790> look<00:00:42.030> at<00:00:42.210> it<00:00:42.360> you<00:00:42.450> can<00:00:42.570> see<00:00:42.780> that<00:00:42.989> it's<00:00:43.110> a

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
a look at it you can see that it's a

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.319 
a look at it you can see that it's a
little<00:00:43.379> bit<00:00:43.500> rough<00:00:43.800> it's<00:00:44.640> a<00:00:44.700> lot<00:00:44.879> better<00:00:45.120> than

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
little bit rough it's a lot better than

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.150 
little bit rough it's a lot better than
the<00:00:45.420> other<00:00:45.450> plate<00:00:45.930> though<00:00:46.200> the<00:00:46.800> other<00:00:46.920> plate

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
the other plate though the other plate

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.190 
the other plate though the other plate
was<00:00:47.340> almost<00:00:47.610> illegible<00:00:48.030> so<00:00:48.780> we'll<00:00:48.930> get<00:00:49.050> this

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
was almost illegible so we'll get this

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.260 
was almost illegible so we'll get this
one<00:00:49.379> cleaned<00:00:49.710> up<00:00:49.890> looking<00:00:50.700> nice<00:00:50.850> and<00:00:51.059> shiny

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
one cleaned up looking nice and shiny

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.779 
one cleaned up looking nice and shiny
and<00:00:51.629> put<00:00:51.870> a<00:00:51.899> good<00:00:52.110> coat<00:00:52.320> of<00:00:52.350> epoxy<00:00:52.739> over<00:00:53.190> it<00:00:53.579> to

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
and put a good coat of epoxy over it to

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.360 
and put a good coat of epoxy over it to
keep<00:00:54.719> it<00:00:54.899> well<00:00:55.140> protected<00:00:55.530> for<00:00:55.829> the<00:00:55.890> long<00:00:56.070> term

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
keep it well protected for the long term

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.799 
keep it well protected for the long term
the<00:00:56.760> first<00:00:56.969> step<00:00:57.239> I<00:00:57.390> will<00:00:57.539> do<00:00:57.690> is<00:00:57.960> use<00:00:58.379> a<00:00:58.649> gray

00:00:59.799 --> 00:00:59.809 
the first step I will do is use a gray

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:04.070 
the first step I will do is use a gray
coarse<00:01:00.809> roughing<00:01:01.800> block<00:01:02.340> on<00:01:03.059> this<00:01:03.359> wheel<00:01:03.629> here

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
coarse roughing block on this wheel here

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.219 
coarse roughing block on this wheel here
to<00:01:04.650> get<00:01:04.860> most<00:01:05.460> of<00:01:05.760> the<00:01:06.360> remaining<00:01:06.720> gunk<00:01:07.080> and

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
to get most of the remaining gunk and

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.770 
to get most of the remaining gunk and
scratches<00:01:07.830> off<00:01:08.010> of<00:01:08.189> it<00:01:08.340> then<00:01:09.150> I<00:01:09.180> will<00:01:09.479> change

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
scratches off of it then I will change

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.010 
scratches off of it then I will change
to<00:01:09.930> a<00:01:10.530> white<00:01:10.890> polishing<00:01:11.610> stone<00:01:11.880> on<00:01:12.180> a<00:01:12.600> separate

to a white polishing stone on a separate

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.649 
to a white polishing stone on a separate
wheel<00:01:13.200> over<00:01:13.560> here<00:01:13.950> with<00:01:14.400> a<00:01:14.430> softer<00:01:14.970> cotton

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
wheel over here with a softer cotton

wheel and that'll put the polish on and

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:25.730 
wheel and that'll put the polish on and
give<00:01:18.840> the<00:01:18.960> good<00:01:19.110> Sheen

that<00:01:39.140> I<00:01:39.230> don't<00:01:39.290> transfer<00:01:39.950> it<00:01:40.070> on<00:01:40.190> to<00:01:40.430> the

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:40.610 
that I don't transfer it on to the

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:44.860 
that I don't transfer it on to the
polishing<00:01:41.210> wheel<00:01:42.640> and<00:01:43.640> so<00:01:44.060> you<00:01:44.090> can<00:01:44.450> see<00:01:44.660> this

polishing wheel and so you can see this

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:47.110 
polishing wheel and so you can see this
plate<00:01:45.590> is<00:01:45.800> already<00:01:46.250> starting<00:01:46.640> to<00:01:46.700> look<00:01:46.850> pretty

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.680 
this polishing scenario but for somebody
on<00:02:13.860> a<00:02:13.890> budget<00:02:14.280> I<00:02:14.459> think<00:02:14.940> this<00:02:15.269> works<00:02:15.480> pretty

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
on a budget I think this works pretty

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:16.420 
on a budget I think this works pretty
good

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:16.430 
good

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:20.030 
good
there<00:02:17.430> you<00:02:17.580> can<00:02:17.760> see<00:02:17.970> that<00:02:18.299> this<00:02:18.480> is<00:02:19.040> very

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
there you can see that this is very

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.030 
there you can see that this is very
shiny<00:02:21.019> doesn't<00:02:22.019> look<00:02:22.140> quite<00:02:22.260> new<00:02:22.590> but<00:02:22.890> it

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
shiny doesn't look quite new but it

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:24.800 
shiny doesn't look quite new but it
looks<00:02:23.190> a<00:02:23.280> whole<00:02:23.310> lot<00:02:23.519> better<00:02:23.790> than<00:02:24.120> it<00:02:24.390> did

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
looks a whole lot better than it did

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:27.619 
looks a whole lot better than it did
now<00:02:25.049> that<00:02:25.260> the<00:02:25.349> plate<00:02:25.620> is<00:02:25.650> all<00:02:26.010> clean<00:02:26.629> I'm

00:02:27.619 --> 00:02:27.629 
now that the plate is all clean I'm

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:30.229 
now that the plate is all clean I'm
going<00:02:28.140> to<00:02:28.379> go<00:02:28.709> ahead<00:02:28.799> and<00:02:29.040> mix<00:02:29.190> the<00:02:29.370> epoxy<00:02:29.489> I

00:02:30.229 --> 00:02:30.239 
going to go ahead and mix the epoxy I

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:33.380 
going to go ahead and mix the epoxy I
use<00:02:31.019> the<00:02:31.200> stems<00:02:31.500> of<00:02:31.680> old<00:02:31.920> foam<00:02:32.310> brushes<00:02:32.790> I<00:02:33.030> cut

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
use the stems of old foam brushes I cut

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:35.479 
use the stems of old foam brushes I cut
off<00:02:33.510> the<00:02:33.660> foam<00:02:33.900> portion<00:02:34.410> of<00:02:34.560> it<00:02:34.709> because<00:02:35.400> I

00:02:35.479 --> 00:02:35.489 
off the foam portion of it because I

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:37.460 
off the foam portion of it because I
want<00:02:35.670> something<00:02:35.910> round<00:02:36.269> to<00:02:36.690> mix<00:02:36.900> with<00:02:37.110> I<00:02:37.380> think

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
want something round to mix with I think

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:39.890 
want something round to mix with I think
that<00:02:37.799> it<00:02:37.920> creates<00:02:38.579> a<00:02:38.670> few<00:02:38.910> less<00:02:39.180> air<00:02:39.480> bubbles

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
that it creates a few less air bubbles

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:41.839 
that it creates a few less air bubbles
in<00:02:40.049> the<00:02:40.140> epoxy<00:02:40.500> than<00:02:40.890> using<00:02:41.190> something<00:02:41.430> square

00:02:41.839 --> 00:02:41.849 
in the epoxy than using something square

pumps<00:02:54.720> don't<00:02:54.870> work<00:02:55.230> exactly<00:02:55.709> all<00:02:55.980> that<00:02:56.190> well

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:56.459

you<00:02:56.670> have<00:02:56.790> to<00:02:56.879> be<00:02:56.970> kind<00:02:57.150> of<00:02:57.239> particular<00:02:57.540> how

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
you have to be kind of particular how

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.170 
you have to be kind of particular how
you<00:02:57.900> use<00:02:58.230> them<00:02:58.379> so<00:02:58.560> you<00:02:58.680> can<00:02:58.799> get<00:02:58.950> the<00:02:59.160> just<00:03:00.000> the

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
you use them so you can get the just the

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:02.840 
you use them so you can get the just the
right<00:03:00.360> amount<00:03:00.690> of<00:03:01.040> mixture<00:03:02.040> since<00:03:02.549> this<00:03:02.670> is<00:03:02.819> a

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:02.850 
right amount of mixture since this is a

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:06.699 
right amount of mixture since this is a
three<00:03:03.180> to<00:03:03.299> one<00:03:03.329> ratio<00:03:04.220> so<00:03:05.220> I'll<00:03:05.519> pump<00:03:05.819> in<00:03:05.970> here

00:03:06.699 --> 00:03:06.709 
three to one ratio so I'll pump in here

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:14.030 
three to one ratio so I'll pump in here
this<00:03:07.709> one<00:03:07.950> pumped<00:03:08.340> good<00:03:08.549> this<00:03:08.790> time<00:03:12.650> good<00:03:13.650> both

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.040 
this one pumped good this time good both

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:18.440 
this one pumped good this time good both
of<00:03:14.280> them<00:03:14.400> did<00:03:14.579> this<00:03:14.819> time<00:03:15.739> and<00:03:16.739> then<00:03:17.190> I<00:03:17.579> will

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
of them did this time and then I will

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:22.039 
of them did this time and then I will
mix<00:03:18.660> up<00:03:18.900> for<00:03:19.519> probably<00:03:20.519> about<00:03:20.730> three<00:03:21.269> solid

00:03:22.039 --> 00:03:22.049 
mix up for probably about three solid

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:25.009 
mix up for probably about three solid
minutes<00:03:22.400> now<00:03:23.400> I<00:03:23.430> will<00:03:23.910> pour<00:03:24.150> the<00:03:24.269> epoxy<00:03:24.900> in

00:03:25.009 --> 00:03:25.019 
minutes now I will pour the epoxy in

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:27.409 
minutes now I will pour the epoxy in
here<00:03:25.349> there's<00:03:25.639> several<00:03:26.639> air<00:03:26.790> bubbles<00:03:27.180> that

00:03:27.409 --> 00:03:27.419 
here there's several air bubbles that

00:03:27.419 --> 00:03:29.900 
here there's several air bubbles that
did<00:03:28.139> show<00:03:28.440> up<00:03:28.650> in<00:03:28.799> here<00:03:28.980> from<00:03:29.190> mixing<00:03:29.579> I<00:03:29.730> think

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:29.910 
did show up in here from mixing I think

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:31.580 
did show up in here from mixing I think
it's<00:03:30.030> because<00:03:30.329> I<00:03:30.480> got<00:03:30.599> a<00:03:30.660> low<00:03:30.840> temperature<00:03:31.230> in

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590 
it's because I got a low temperature in

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:41.720 
it's because I got a low temperature in
my<00:03:31.769> shop<00:03:39.230> using<00:03:40.230> a<00:03:40.319> foam<00:03:40.560> brush<00:03:40.829> I'll<00:03:41.250> put<00:03:41.489> this

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:41.730 
my shop using a foam brush I'll put this

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:49.610 
my shop using a foam brush I'll put this
on<00:03:42.680> as<00:03:43.680> even<00:03:44.069> as<00:03:44.220> I<00:03:44.340> can<00:03:47.870> this<00:03:48.870> stuff<00:03:49.139> levels

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:49.620 
on as even as I can this stuff levels

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:51.949 
on as even as I can this stuff levels
out<00:03:49.799> pretty<00:03:50.160> easily<00:03:50.459> so<00:03:50.790> I'll<00:03:51.480> have<00:03:51.660> to<00:03:51.750> worry

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:51.959 
out pretty easily so I'll have to worry

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:55.640 
out pretty easily so I'll have to worry
too<00:03:52.200> much<00:03:52.230> about<00:03:52.470> brush<00:03:53.130> strokes<00:03:54.169> just<00:03:55.169> doing

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:55.650 
too much about brush strokes just doing

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:59.809 
too much about brush strokes just doing
a<00:03:55.739> very<00:03:56.130> light<00:03:56.549> touch<00:03:56.910> with<00:03:57.239> this<00:03:58.669> pretty<00:03:59.669> much

00:03:59.809 --> 00:03:59.819 
a very light touch with this pretty much

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:01.640 
a very light touch with this pretty much
the<00:03:59.849> weight<00:04:00.239> of<00:04:00.389> the<00:04:00.450> brush<00:04:00.750> is<00:04:01.079> doing<00:04:01.470> the

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:01.650 
the weight of the brush is doing the

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:04.039 
the weight of the brush is doing the
work<00:04:01.859> couple<00:04:02.760> little<00:04:03.030> air<00:04:03.209> bubbles<00:04:03.630> within

00:04:04.039 --> 00:04:04.049 
work couple little air bubbles within

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:07.309 
work couple little air bubbles within
the<00:04:04.260> epoxy<00:04:04.980> so

00:04:07.309 --> 00:04:07.319 
the epoxy so

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:13.729 

a<00:04:07.349> quick<00:04:07.680> torch<00:04:08.040> run<00:04:08.340> on<00:04:08.519> it<00:04:12.019> that<00:04:13.019> cleaned<00:04:13.620> it

00:04:13.729 --> 00:04:13.739 
a quick torch run on it that cleaned it

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:15.800 
a quick torch run on it that cleaned it
up<00:04:13.859> I'll<00:04:14.340> transfer<00:04:14.790> this<00:04:14.969> to<00:04:15.150> a<00:04:15.180> clean<00:04:15.510> piece

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:15.810 
up I'll transfer this to a clean piece

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:18.590 
up I'll transfer this to a clean piece
of<00:04:15.959> cardboard<00:04:16.560> and<00:04:16.769> let<00:04:17.519> it<00:04:17.639> dry<00:04:17.850> for<00:04:18.269> at<00:04:18.570> least

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:21.499 
of cardboard and let it dry for at least
24<00:04:18.900> hours<00:04:19.400> usually<00:04:20.400> the<00:04:20.519> West<00:04:20.729> system<00:04:21.150> becomes

00:04:21.499 --> 00:04:21.509 
24 hours usually the West system becomes

00:04:21.509 --> 00:04:24.499 
24 hours usually the West system becomes

longer well here's the panel's completed

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:28.550 
longer well here's the panel's completed
they've<00:04:27.150> got<00:04:27.300> the<00:04:27.449> epoxy<00:04:27.930> coating<00:04:28.289> on<00:04:28.410> them

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:28.560 
they've got the epoxy coating on them

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:32.570 
they've got the epoxy coating on them
and<00:04:28.680> is<00:04:28.770> dried<00:04:30.800> came<00:04:31.800> out<00:04:31.919> pretty<00:04:32.099> good<00:04:32.250> and

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:32.580 
and is dried came out pretty good and

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:35.529 
and is dried came out pretty good and
they<00:04:32.880> still<00:04:33.150> maintain<00:04:33.660> some<00:04:33.900> flexibility<00:04:34.620> so

00:04:35.529 --> 00:04:35.539 
they still maintain some flexibility so
