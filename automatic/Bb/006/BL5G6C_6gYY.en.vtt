00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:07.900 
weekend I think we will struck a little

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:11.070 
weekend I think we will struck a little
bit<00:04:08.020> but<00:04:08.200> we<00:04:08.560> try<00:04:08.980> to<00:04:09.670> set<00:04:09.940> the<00:04:10.060> car<00:04:10.270> as<00:04:10.510> good<00:04:10.960> as

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:11.080 
bit but we try to set the car as good as

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:14.550 
bit but we try to set the car as good as
possible<00:04:11.560> for<00:04:12.430> the<00:04:12.490> slow<00:04:12.730> corners<00:04:13.060> and<00:04:13.570> now<00:04:14.350> in

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:14.560 
possible for the slow corners and now in

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:16.680 
possible for the slow corners and now in
the<00:04:14.860> free<00:04:15.460> practice<00:04:15.640> I<00:04:15.910> have<00:04:16.030> to<00:04:16.180> say<00:04:16.330> the<00:04:16.540> car

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:16.690 
the free practice I have to say the car

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:19.080 
the free practice I have to say the car
was<00:04:16.750> getting<00:04:17.200> better<00:04:17.320> and<00:04:17.500> better<00:04:18.090> especially

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:19.090 
was getting better and better especially

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:20.910 
was getting better and better especially
at<00:04:19.540> the<00:04:19.690> end<00:04:19.720> with<00:04:20.080> new<00:04:20.230> tires<00:04:20.440> it<00:04:20.739> was

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:20.920 
at the end with new tires it was

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:23.430 
at the end with new tires it was
actually<00:04:21.370> okay<00:04:21.720> if<00:04:22.720> you<00:04:22.870> can<00:04:23.020> improve<00:04:23.320> a

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:23.440 
actually okay if you can improve a

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:25.530 
actually okay if you can improve a
little<00:04:23.560> bit<00:04:23.800> for<00:04:23.980> the<00:04:24.040> qualifying<00:04:24.640> I<00:04:24.880> think<00:04:25.420> we

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:25.540 
little bit for the qualifying I think we

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:27.900 
little bit for the qualifying I think we
are<00:04:25.660> in<00:04:25.690> good<00:04:26.050> good<00:04:26.650> pace<00:04:26.890> and<00:04:26.920> then<00:04:27.460> for<00:04:27.820> the

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:27.910 
are in good good pace and then for the

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:30.180 
are in good good pace and then for the
rates<00:04:28.120> we<00:04:28.270> will<00:04:28.450> see<00:04:28.630> but<00:04:29.260> I<00:04:29.590> think<00:04:29.890> it's<00:04:30.010> not

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:30.190 
rates we will see but I think it's not

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:32.719 
rates we will see but I think it's not
gonna<00:04:30.400> be<00:04:30.580> easy<00:04:30.610> this<00:04:30.970> weekend<00:04:31.330> for<00:04:31.480> sure
