00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.470
 Well then 

00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:11.190
 Yes Yes Aliens and ufos have been found in Mexico 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:15.330
 Yes you this Well that famous story of you is but a little around here 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:19.230
 It is a red circle place names because you can introduce this Mexican baby 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:22.710
 Guddo that has been discovered in Akanbarou 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:27.460
 Of course it is made by humans because it is a dog 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:29.670
 Do you think that this is a dinosaur, whatever you think 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:34.230
 That's right Dinosaur 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:41.370
 So there is no reason why I have seen dinosaurs 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:48.120
 It seems that the bridge has been destroyed 65 million years ago when human beings were born 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:49.890
 So it is basically impossible for humans to look at dinosaurs and make their shapes. 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.829
 Many dinosaur dogs 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:55.039
 Nana 

00:00:51.829 --> 00:01:01.100
 As one of the so-called parts in that 

00:00:55.039 --> 00:01:06.680
 Whether known that Tteyuu this tool with the dinosaurs of this Atanbara is that dating 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:08.180
 I'm doing something in a few ways, but I'm already saying it's hot 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:14.870
 Yeah it is 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:20.350
 2 chat that there is no while care about 4500 years roughly from now the place was a method 

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:24.400
 And I say come from is about large-generation 7 million yen of me another human history 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:32.710
 Within that, civilization has already started 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:40.340
 Recently dinosaurs become this or is this soft body system that's either lived up to the march'm not a House of Councilors Ne' 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:45.770
 There are some of them already gone, but there are 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:47.149
 Exhibition doing full terms What is this kind of wind in the management of Campi that like a few more year is out 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:48.400
 And being 

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:54.160
 Yes 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:56.820
 So this is pretty much like that, but if you've actually seen it or you don't 

00:01:54.160 --> 00:02:01.530
 That imagination is abundant 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:06.770
 As long as a guy like Tsuburaya- Pro is making it, I can not make such a thing. 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:12.319
 It's there, but tries to cut off that easily whether or not the real thing it is this in the sense that so 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:17.599
 Yes I This'm also still of scientists opinion say not close to the real thing in Doya 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:19.610
 Of course not an ordinary person 普通 It is quite difficult to make only this one, so get on 

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:24.170
 Something new this time 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:26.120
 It is this kind of wind Without this Yes and mixed in this dinosaur tool 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:30.050
 What do you think 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:31.680
 ufo there is a sauce 5 u 4 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:38.340
 Oh dear 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:43.109
 I'd are if I do not know what that imitates what the pike be considered a jerk Ni to see in the 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:47.180
 So you can see that this is also ufo if you really see it, but it is dome-shaped 

00:02:43.109 --> 00:02:49.550
 Year version Gataiu how'm disk there is a dome 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:54.050
 I like this such a variety this disk 

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:57.610
 Yeah but there they Though I do not know what was used in any application 

00:02:54.050 --> 00:03:00.700
 It is very close like this to see the shape 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:03.750
 If you look at it now, I can not see it as an ashtray 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:10.410
 there ashtray of ufo type 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:18.720
 People who are next to the next to the next world how of those days slipped Ettoko is what this 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:19.830
 Also it looks as wearing basically the here in what countries Fuppoi from this Well modeling 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:23.770
 The 

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:28.300
 Also symbolically he's a little 

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:30.300
 Well the fact that because the universal human Tom countenance is different 

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:32.880
 It is considering one set 

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:34.710
 Well disc type ufo 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:39.440
 I made a sad face 

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:42.569
 It this is I'm a determined by the sacrifice business name Speaking of strange clay figures Yes 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:46.920
 It is a much set in this is possibly that 

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:48.140
 It may not have been seen that person 4500 years ago 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:49.520
 Well that's right 

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:54.580
 actually 

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:54.580
 It's a story, so I'm smiling laugh Opper 2 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:04:01.780
 that 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:04.840
 I'll go ahead for a moment, but in this way humans and that 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:08.739
 This is the reason why dinosaurs are 

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:14.470
 Whether the mother has seemed at any good of different but it is not it it is if you look at dinosaur Akanbaru 

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:16.060
 I say Happla tone came out that little place but I'm away in the direction of Pell 

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:16.280
 After all this is out 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:18.280
 this 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:23.530
 It's about the same age, isn't it? 

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:24.020
 What are you doing it is this number do not know a little that of Koch of the person you'd challenges measurement 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:24.850
 The 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:33.460
 Ah 

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:36.610
 With respect to the Ica Stones that just came out together have been quite detailed analysis in its modern 

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:42.220
 It is already understood that it is not made 

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:44.140
 I see in but I was out the story of how that that Cabrera Ston I okay with it net now 

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:44.870
 I like it great with a brush or 

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:46.820
 From what age 

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:52.970
 I got a photo 

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:55.230
 I'm eating a human head like this , but on the contrary, because I'm a dinosaur head 

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:56.560
 I'm sorry 

00:04:55.230 --> 00:05:01.330
 I later 

00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:05.310
 This this I kinda scapegoat in various types but I know I dinosaurs a little this 

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:09.270
 I arranged from the dinosaur picture book , but this is that 

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:13.080
 That according to the legal academic classification 

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:17.160
 Is it Tyrannosaurus or Triceratops? 

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:18.760
 Hey Since this is is so little fate that I say platypus reason 

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:22.690
 Intractable disease service 

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:27.990
 Well since the close supply-demand animation, but that was 

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:27.990
 It is a little small animal legs, but the bottom is 

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:35.430
 But so it is taking Gozaru One stearyl 

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:36.620
 In I'd seen and you'll look mirror everyone in comparison with this is I left this is you have all 

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:39.360
 you know 

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:41.440
 In Cabrera Stone 

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:46.240
 It's amazing . 

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:46.810
 It seems that I imagined that it was a recovery , so it's too much done to imagine this 

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:49.249
 From 

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:51.639
 As Mikami said 

00:05:49.249 --> 00:05:57.999
 I wonder if it is a mitan 

00:05:51.639 --> 00:05:59.830
 So not I had eaten the hunting dinosaurs actually together with the green beans like this ahead 

00:05:57.999 --> 00:06:05.920
 It is not to say selfish 

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:06.760
 When I come to see this, I'm wondering if I come back to the people after the fact when I come back first 

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:10.340
 Say 

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:13.350
 Oh Well Well it all Sanmaa It is such a story 

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:17.250
 That opus Juie place 

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:21.590
 I guess that is to say Junior No. 2 early in the wave of Mr. Gyoki's shop 

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:23.110
 It 's right that I was in charge of this nervous area 

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:27.610
 of 

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:28.910
 I asked if this was a bit more interesting as it came in and it was a bit more interesting 

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:31.240
 Though 

00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:33.449
 Hey this doll 

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:36.080
 Well this is kinda 

00:06:33.449 --> 00:06:36.080
 With aliens 

00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:59.590
 here are wildebeest 

00:06:55.390 --> 00:07:03.160
 It's a little dim burner like no other 

00:06:59.590 --> 00:07:04.270
 I think that there is very orbiting I also this is 

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:10.370
 Yes 

00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:13.449
 Even if you look at it after the Dubbo, it will not start to begin fighting with the aliens 

00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:17.319
 Then 2 industries please 

00:07:13.449 --> 00:07:18.370

00:07:18.370 --> 00:07:26.909
 Well Well now Well what made imitations Te for souvenirs or current 

00:07:24.009 --> 00:07:26.909
