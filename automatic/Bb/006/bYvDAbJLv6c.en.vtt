00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.279
 And then, beauty, I'll go today. 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:08.730
 to teach you how to get the 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:11.639
 your future from the PS3 or your box and when 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:15.870
 It's on your computer that playing is what 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:17.820
 so is a lot of people like me who have 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.680
 game that is not worth even spending 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:24.150
 money is not that it is not worth knowing 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:27.599
 to buy the ps3 is that the one here 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:30.480
 the df should note the institute here was 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:32.850
 released by 6 3 also only that he is 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.070
 so in a game that does not have no one 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.440
 cooperative mode has an online mode 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.750
 then it is worth spending 180 reais in 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.989
 game that I'm going to do final it goes 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:45.870
 stay so low income for 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:48.300
 computer is easy for me to play when 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.590
 has a cable other than connecting 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.140
 do the same 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:59.059
 several times here is the description of the 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:01:06.949
 video and here comes this faithful version below 

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:06.949

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:10.329

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:20.200
 I was full here beauty then went down 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:26.020
 your neighborhood and download it for sure 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:26.020
 this is the folder is there 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:34.909

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:38.780

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:44.350
 Be there because I already have it. See you there. 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:44.350
 access the program connects the control 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:50.840
 you're connecting the patrol will stay 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:57.619
 that orange belly 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:59.630
 You pick up the belly and I do not think the 

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:03.470
 has been a research 3 has been 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:05.990
 favored in 2001 before 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:08.660
 update an older version today 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:12.709
 of this program I had to customize 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:14.180
 all you have to say is that the move 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:17.480
 with him he knows why he came 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:20.180
 all set up and if you put in the 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:22.459
 because here it is already here 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:25.370
 if I put what I leave 3 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:27.380
 the computer did not recognize the right to 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:29.030

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:32.090

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:36.890
 he recognized as if it were m1 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:39.320
 understood then it does not work very well 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:40.190
 the school that is the case for which 

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:42.920
