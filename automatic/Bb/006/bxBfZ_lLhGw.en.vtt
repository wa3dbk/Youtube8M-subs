and<00:02:49.660> they<00:02:50.080> don't<00:02:50.140> know<00:02:50.230> what<00:02:50.350> to<00:02:50.410> do<00:02:50.590> so<00:02:50.860> that's

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.010 
and they don't know what to do so that's

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:52.140 
and they don't know what to do so that's
why<00:02:51.130> Michelle<00:02:51.400> wants<00:02:51.670> to<00:02:51.730> go<00:02:51.819> to<00:02:51.880> Washington

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:52.150 
why Michelle wants to go to Washington

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:53.520 
why Michelle wants to go to Washington
because<00:02:52.840> she<00:02:52.989> thinks<00:02:53.260> that<00:02:53.290> there's

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:53.530 
because she thinks that there's

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:54.780 
because she thinks that there's
something<00:02:53.799> there<00:02:53.980> that<00:02:54.010> maybe<00:02:54.310> they<00:02:54.519> can<00:02:54.670> look

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:54.790 
something there that maybe they can look

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:56.550 
something there that maybe they can look
forward<00:02:55.060> to<00:02:55.299> like<00:02:55.480> staying<00:02:55.840> at<00:02:56.080> and<00:02:56.319> like

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:56.560 
forward to like staying at and like

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:57.990 
forward to like staying at and like
starting<00:02:56.920> up<00:02:57.010> a<00:02:57.069> whole<00:02:57.220> community<00:02:57.400> so<00:02:57.910> the

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:58.000 
starting up a whole community so the

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.460 
starting up a whole community so the
next<00:02:58.209> couple<00:02:58.480> episodes<00:02:58.959> of<00:02:59.049> them<00:02:59.200> are<00:02:59.380> gonna

00:02:59.460 --> 00:02:59.470 
next couple episodes of them are gonna

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:01.979 
next couple episodes of them are gonna
be<00:02:59.650> going<00:03:00.069> to<00:03:00.220> Washington<00:03:00.610> if<00:03:01.209> anything<00:03:01.750> and

00:03:01.979 --> 00:03:01.989 
be going to Washington if anything and

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:03.479 
be going to Washington if anything and
probably<00:03:02.440> I<00:03:02.560> think<00:03:02.620> the<00:03:02.830> final<00:03:02.980> season<00:03:03.370> will

00:03:03.479 --> 00:03:03.489 
probably I think the final season will

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:05.039 
probably I think the final season will
probably<00:03:03.760> get<00:03:03.819> them<00:03:03.970> at<00:03:04.330> Washington<00:03:04.930> if

00:03:05.039 --> 00:03:05.049 
probably get them at Washington if

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:06.210 
probably get them at Washington if
anything<00:03:05.380> else<00:03:05.590> they're<00:03:05.769> not<00:03:05.890> that<00:03:06.010> far<00:03:06.190> from
