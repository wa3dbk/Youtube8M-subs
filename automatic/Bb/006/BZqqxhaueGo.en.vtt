00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:05.279
 hello friends in this video i want 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:08.610
 show you recently acquired by me 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:11.940
 model this model of tractor mtz-50 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:15.990
 scale 1 43 of the recently launched in 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:19.010
 Russian magazine series about tractors and 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:21.060
 This tractor went under the first number and 

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:22.970
 recommended price from the first release 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.380
 makes 99 rubles 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:28.699
 subsequent issues will cost in 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:31.080
 about 300 rubles and my collection 

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:34.980
 there is only one tractor 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:38.160
 This is a plastic Kirovets who 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.870
 was made from the time of the USSR and 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:43.860
 principle i don't collect tractor from but 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:46.700
 I decided to buy this model because in 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:49.200
 first it has an attractive price and 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:52.579
 for its price category 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:55.980
 the tractor is of very good quality 

00:00:52.579 --> 00:01:00.420
 in size it fits well scale 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:05.610
 ding 43 all main dimensions are exactly 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:09.060
 complied with a well-recognized model and this 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:13.170
 tractor from the regular series as many 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:16.920
 know the previous year was a pilot 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:20.610
 a series of these tractors if not mistaken 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:24.810
 It was sold to Yekaterinburg and tractors 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:25.560
 from the pilot series they were lighter 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:30.079
 coloring 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:32.210
 had no headlights and they had a little bit 

00:01:30.079 --> 00:01:34.650
 modified exhaust system 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:36.659
 This tractor manufacturer is a little bit 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:39.960
 improve finalized 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:42.600
 the main drawbacks in the model but 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:45.689
 less model she is pretty simple but 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:48.960
 looks and perceived pretty 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:53.430
 good tractor cab made of 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:55.979
 plastic and what's interesting is that the doors on 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:59.850
 models are made as separate 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:00.390
 parts and just pasted the part itself 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.960
 cabins 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:05.899
 if you wish you can disconnect them 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:09.720
 make in a static position 

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:12.990
 half open or make loops and 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:16.030
 make the doors open 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:17.800
 hood and frame model made of 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:20.680
 metal and all other elements 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:23.530
 made of plastic the model has 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:24.370
 pretty well-developed wheel 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:27.550
 discs 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:30.150
 the disc itself is shod in a rubber tire that I 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:35.260
 Drill do it on their models 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:38.940
 hole like a prototype and i think it 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:43.480
 slightly improve the perception of the model 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:47.680
 mutation of engine moldings and what 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:51.160
 Interesting on the model made molding 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:52.209
 which imitates the number plate 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:54.780
 body model 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:57.580
 something, too, in principle, pretty 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:03:01.380
 positive element in terms of 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:04.330
 production of this model and another 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:07.530
 A good nuance is that on this 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:10.570
 models with a little effort you can 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:13.890
 make the front wheels swivel 

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:16.959
 and the front axle itself also make 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:19.680
 workers need to do this 

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:23.550
 separate the front axle from the bottom of the model 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:27.459
 drill a hole put pins 

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:29.680
 both on the frame and on the swivel 

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:31.390
 mechanisms and in principle such 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:34.300
 small manipulations you can 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:36.400
 make a turning brain on this 

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:41.019
 models further on your model me too 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:42.880
 I will do this operation and make a video like 

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:45.000
 i did it and show you the final 

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:45.000
 result 

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:59.260
 such a cute tractor and who collects 

00:03:54.550 --> 00:04:01.550
 agricultural machinery or various 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:06.800
 tractors pay attention to this 

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:09.590
 the manufacturer has 60 issues announced 

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:13.790
 first eight issues already known 

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:16.820
 Such models will likely I do not 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:18.500
 I will collect this series maybe 

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:20.900
 single copies which to me 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:23.810
 but nevertheless like models 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:24.500
 quite interesting and in principle few 

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:29.420
 releases 

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:30.740
 tractor of the Russian market and tractor 

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:35.200
 which were produced by the Soviet Union 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:37.610
 so basically i find it pretty 

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:40.010
 good model to fill up your 

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:41.510
 collection and it was a review of the model 

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:43.520
 tractor mtz 

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:45.790
 thank you for your attention see you next 

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:45.790
