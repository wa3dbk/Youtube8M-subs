you're<00:02:40.940> done<00:02:40.970> you<00:02:41.800> can<00:02:42.800> hit<00:02:42.890> exit<00:02:44.020> and<00:02:45.400> then

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:46.400 
you're done you can hit exit and then

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.430 
you're done you can hit exit and then
it's<00:02:46.550> going<00:02:46.670> to<00:02:46.730> do<00:02:46.990> if<00:02:47.990> you<00:02:48.170> do<00:02:48.320> the

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:48.440 
it's going to do if you do the

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:50.980 
it's going to do if you do the
convergence<00:02:49.150> right<00:02:50.150> there<00:02:50.360> for<00:02:50.570> all<00:02:50.720> of<00:02:50.750> them

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:50.990 
convergence right there for all of them

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:54.040 
convergence right there for all of them
but<00:02:51.260> you<00:02:51.320> have<00:02:51.530> to<00:02:51.680> hit<00:02:51.860> the<00:02:51.980> buttons<00:02:52.310> one<00:02:53.210> puts

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:54.050 
but you have to hit the buttons one puts

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:55.060 
but you have to hit the buttons one puts
you<00:02:54.140> on<00:02:54.200> the<00:02:54.380> top<00:02:54.590> left

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:55.070 
you on the top left

00:02:55.070 --> 00:03:00.550 
you on the top left
so<00:02:55.520> you<00:02:55.640> hit<00:02:55.820> one<00:02:56.440> the<00:02:57.440> number<00:02:57.770> one<00:02:58.010> button<00:02:59.560> see

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:00.560 
so you hit one the number one button see

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:02.290 
so you hit one the number one button see
how<00:03:00.650> the<00:03:00.710> red<00:03:01.160> convergence<00:03:01.730> is<00:03:01.880> out<00:03:02.030> to<00:03:02.180> the

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:02.300 
how the red convergence is out to the

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:07.360 
how the red convergence is out to the
right<00:03:03.010> so<00:03:04.010> hit<00:03:04.460> select<00:03:04.790> and<00:03:05.740> choose<00:03:06.740> right<00:03:07.100> and

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:07.370 
right so hit select and choose right and

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:11.680 
right so hit select and choose right and
so<00:03:07.640> now<00:03:07.940> it's<00:03:08.120> in<00:03:08.240> red<00:03:08.510> mode<00:03:08.920> so<00:03:09.920> now<00:03:10.480> using<00:03:11.480> the

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:11.690 
so now it's in red mode so now using the

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:15.820 
so now it's in red mode so now using the
d-pad<00:03:12.080> directional<00:03:12.890> pad<00:03:14.170> since<00:03:15.170> the<00:03:15.440> red<00:03:15.620> is

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:15.830 
d-pad directional pad since the red is

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:19.470 
d-pad directional pad since the red is
to<00:03:16.040> the<00:03:16.160> right<00:03:16.370> side<00:03:16.730> of<00:03:17.090> the<00:03:17.660> white<00:03:18.370> crosshair

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:19.480 
to the right side of the white crosshair

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:22.420 
to the right side of the white crosshair
you<00:03:20.480> want<00:03:20.690> to<00:03:20.810> go<00:03:20.930> left<00:03:21.290> left<00:03:21.440> left<00:03:21.800> left<00:03:22.100> left

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:22.430 
you want to go left left left left left

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:25.449 
you want to go left left left left left
left<00:03:22.760> left<00:03:23.060> left<00:03:23.390> left<00:03:23.720> on<00:03:24.170> the<00:03:24.260> d-pad<00:03:24.470> then<00:03:25.220> up

00:03:25.449 --> 00:03:25.459 
left left left left on the d-pad then up

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:29.350 
left left left left on the d-pad then up
up<00:03:26.590> and<00:03:27.590> that's<00:03:27.770> it<00:03:28.010> and<00:03:28.220> the<00:03:28.940> blue<00:03:29.120> looks

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:29.360 
up and that's it and the blue looks

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:31.330 
up and that's it and the blue looks
pretty<00:03:29.660> good<00:03:29.840> on<00:03:29.900> that<00:03:30.200> so<00:03:30.800> we'll<00:03:30.950> leave<00:03:31.130> the

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:31.340 
pretty good on that so we'll leave the

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:37.540 
pretty good on that so we'll leave the
blue<00:03:32.020> and<00:03:33.020> then<00:03:33.140> you<00:03:33.200> would<00:03:33.680> have<00:03:33.830> to<00:03:33.950> hit<00:03:34.100> exit

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:37.550 

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:40.480 

and<00:03:37.670> then<00:03:38.210> just<00:03:38.570> do<00:03:38.810> the<00:03:39.200> same<00:03:39.320> thing<00:03:39.500> you<00:03:40.460> can

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:40.490 
and then just do the same thing you can

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:44.230 
and then just do the same thing you can
do<00:03:40.700> the<00:03:40.940> number<00:03:41.540> two<00:03:42.610> but<00:03:43.610> the<00:03:43.790> number<00:03:44.090> two

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:44.240 
do the number two but the number two

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:46.690 
do the number two but the number two
looks<00:03:44.450> okay<00:03:44.780> I<00:03:45.020> mean<00:03:45.650> from<00:03:45.980> this<00:03:46.160> point<00:03:46.400> on<00:03:46.550> you

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:46.700 
looks okay I mean from this point on you

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:48.670 
looks okay I mean from this point on you
could<00:03:46.820> just<00:03:47.030> do<00:03:47.180> one<00:03:47.900> two<00:03:48.080> three<00:03:48.290> four<00:03:48.500> five

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:48.680 
could just do one two three four five

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:51.420 
could just do one two three four five
six<00:03:48.890> seven<00:03:49.070> eight<00:03:49.310> nine<00:03:49.340> and<00:03:50.000> then<00:03:50.360> exit<00:03:50.720> out

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:51.430 
six seven eight nine and then exit out

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:54.430 
six seven eight nine and then exit out
but<00:03:52.430> some<00:03:52.880> people<00:03:53.150> say<00:03:53.360> do<00:03:53.660> it<00:03:53.810> this<00:03:53.930> way<00:03:54.110> hit

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:54.440 
but some people say do it this way hit

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:57.550 
but some people say do it this way hit
one<00:03:54.860> then<00:03:55.370> nine<00:03:55.670> and<00:03:56.060> then<00:03:56.690> three<00:03:57.170> and<00:03:57.470> then

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:57.560 
one then nine and then three and then

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:01.300 
one then nine and then three and then
seven<00:03:58.430> and<00:03:58.610> then<00:03:59.000> they<00:03:59.150> do<00:03:59.210> four<00:03:59.630> six<00:04:00.620> I<00:04:00.920> mean

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:01.310 
seven and then they do four six I mean

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:04.810 
seven and then they do four six I mean
there's<00:04:01.670> different<00:04:02.150> ways<00:04:02.540> to<00:04:02.600> do<00:04:02.930> it<00:04:03.820> but

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:04.820 
there's different ways to do it but

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:06.910 
there's different ways to do it but
that's<00:04:05.720> pretty<00:04:05.960> much<00:04:06.080> it<00:04:06.320> once<00:04:06.500> you<00:04:06.620> like

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:06.920 
that's pretty much it once you like

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:10.390 
that's pretty much it once you like
really<00:04:07.250> mainly<00:04:07.490> do<00:04:07.760> the<00:04:07.910> center<00:04:09.100> you<00:04:10.100> can<00:04:10.250> just

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:10.400 
really mainly do the center you can just

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:12.310 
really mainly do the center you can just
leave<00:04:10.610> this<00:04:10.760> Center<00:04:11.090> B<00:04:11.240> and<00:04:11.450> sometimes<00:04:12.110> if

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:12.320 
leave this Center B and sometimes if

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:14.350 
leave this Center B and sometimes if
it's<00:04:12.530> you<00:04:13.340> know<00:04:13.430> just<00:04:13.460> off<00:04:13.820> a<00:04:13.850> little<00:04:14.120> bit<00:04:14.300> that

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:14.360 
it's you know just off a little bit that

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:16.120 
it's you know just off a little bit that
should<00:04:14.630> fix<00:04:14.870> it<00:04:15.110> but<00:04:15.350> if<00:04:15.470> it's<00:04:15.590> really<00:04:15.860> off

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:16.130 
should fix it but if it's really off

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:18.100 
should fix it but if it's really off
then<00:04:16.430> you<00:04:16.580> have<00:04:16.730> to<00:04:16.880> go<00:04:17.090> into<00:04:17.270> this<00:04:17.540> grid<00:04:17.930> and

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:18.110 
then you have to go into this grid and

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:21.850 
then you have to go into this grid and
just<00:04:18.310> go<00:04:19.310> one<00:04:20.299> number<00:04:20.570> at<00:04:20.840> a<00:04:20.870> time<00:04:20.989> and<00:04:21.410> just<00:04:21.470> do

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:21.860 
just go one number at a time and just do

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:23.590 
just go one number at a time and just do
the<00:04:21.980> crosshairs<00:04:22.520> all<00:04:22.790> over<00:04:23.120> the<00:04:23.270> screen

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:23.600 
the crosshairs all over the screen

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:28.740 
the crosshairs all over the screen
