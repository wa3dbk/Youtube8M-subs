00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:11.580
 I'm not very happy to be back 

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:14.930
 here again 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:18.570
 and it's easy I think my decision from 

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:20.610
 I ccoo the mind for clear that creates by 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.180
 here for the treatment that you see so much with 

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:26.230
 the bosch group 

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:28.000
 with colleagues and more because we 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:29.980
 awaits a very exciting season 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.619
 brack for here and for us that 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:35.110
 same as the last say as europe 

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:39.370
 since you have to take advantage of it, not like that if 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:42.070
 I had been my name and well that is your 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:43.930
 house part and happy to be back 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:47.410
 here I already said it and to have the same way 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:50.379
 the one that did not go through his head is 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:52.270
 timely and have clear there was 

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:55.180
 circumstances 

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:56.920
 I did not like them because in the end 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:01:00.810
 I played everything a player wanted but 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:03.690
 well you never should have knots 

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:05.130
 to see how to start over and for 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.590
 here he also gave me a lot and above all 

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:09.750
 for the treatment that I have of the club of 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:12.360
 fellow of the hobby and I'm 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:15.260
 grateful for that treatment he had not 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:19.830
 they did not tell me much either, I think 

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:22.830
 both me and the real one had the same 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:25.680
 intention to follow here that is 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:28.080
 very easy to reach an agreement and already as 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.940
 I said before I'm happy to be here 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:33.780
 and especially for good to show that 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:36.570
 I can play and put the teammates that 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.550
 It is a little what most annoys me the 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:41.760
 last year I could not help a little more and 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:44.700
 good for helping the whole team and 

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:46.680
 good to have a little more minutes would be 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.869
 important I think we're going to have 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.360
 many competitions will play all the 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:53.880
 people alike or you have to help 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:56.430
 you have to be prepared every Wednesday and 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:59.240
 every Saturday I go 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:02.600
 and add and add and that the team goes 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:02.600
 pulling up 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:09.479
 efficient here for good without seeing me 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:14.010
 because I'm excited and good too 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:16.860
 It makes you motivate and wanting to 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:18.300
 Carranque all this and be able to 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:20.910
 dispute minutes that in the end is what 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:24.510
 the most important thing as a tourist if it is 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:26.870
 demanding I think we do not have to 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:29.430
 be playing from Sunday to Sunday and 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:32.220
 let's move on to play sunday wednesday 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:34.920
 and I was going to be demanding but well I think 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:38.070
 that there is enough equipment to like 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:41.100
 to hold that rhythm and it must be 

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:43.170
 well prepared physically and sure that 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:44.630
 we will be good at normal I think that 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:47.540
 the amateur 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:49.910
 You have the right to look for yourself because I believe 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:52.190
 which already summarizes a player and then 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:54.170
 It also makes you afraid that 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:57.260
 that can reach the pilot I do not have 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:59.300
 has to happen are things of the club what 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:02.300
 what I can see is that the club does not 

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:03.470
 intends to sell you would be 

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:06.380
 delighted if he stays here because I 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:10.100
 I think your view with a lot of talent 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:11.960
 for the real and especially that is going 

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:16.250
 help a lot, but I think that 

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:17.960
 the real one is where he has a contract and I 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:20.450
 I think he's going to want to follow me 

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:23.390
 I know I do not know what's going to happen 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:27.170
 neither is it my subject, I think it's a 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:28.880
 theme of both reality madriz and me 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:30.770
 I think I want him to stay here 

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:33.140
 because I think you can help us 

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:35.470
 a lot and villamarÃ­a has much less 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:35.470
 centers
