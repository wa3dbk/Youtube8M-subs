00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:06.220
 and the neighborhood bag launch one of the 

00:00:02.890 --> 00:00:08.200
 four historic districts that have long been 

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:11.019
 should be revitalized for 

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:13.929
 bring back people and neighborhoods anyway 

00:00:11.019 --> 00:00:17.529
 structurally very beautiful and we see a 

00:00:13.929 --> 00:00:22.900
 very very particular sign 

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:26.080
 house for sale for free and there is Mr. 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:28.720
 Marian professor of bari that I imagine is 

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:29.650
 the buyer never the one who has the house 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:32.259
 I'm the donor 

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:34.450
 the donor why this this sale 

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:37.030
 a clearly ironic sign for free 

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:38.920
 we have n't met before three years ago 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:41.380
 being lancianese and wishing well the 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:44.110
 city denounces a complaint situation e 

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:46.660
 of degradation and now we have reached beyond 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:48.360
 we arrived I don't know whose fault it is but 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:51.250
 that I can no longer sleep at night 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.810
 there is no desperation for my house 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:54.040
 led me to make this gesture 

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:56.500
 clearly ironic 

00:00:54.040 --> 00:01:00.190
 but if they give me something by having 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:01.540
 gladly too little to have the 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:03.400
 right to sleep and eat 

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:09.790
 appearing year is always the same 

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:12.460
 cackling noises from now on 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:14.830
 I can't express any more but I am 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:17.620
 also increased thanks to a let's say 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:21.460
 so to a repopulation esterophile perhaps 

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:24.010
 exaggerated and still other problems 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:27.670
 dirt to neglect and bins 

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:29.420
 increase in untrained people increase 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:31.939
 the night 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:34.400
 strange things happen including the 

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:37.340
 transfer of any material 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:39.080
 gender without any control 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:41.479
 from 23 in the morning and become like 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:43.399
 noon but I don't have it with 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:45.159
 nobody i have a lot i turned to 

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:48.170
 all authorities including the police headquarters 

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:50.990
 but I also receive only because then many 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:52.009
 friends and many say so collaborators 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:53.899
 in the area there are not 

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:56.000
 nobody sees anything nobody hears anything 

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:56.600
 and I wouldn't want to go through the idiot of the 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.369
 village 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:00.500
 you know that I am not so then 

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:02.539
 professor of bari selling home for free 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:05.509
 with the sign and if he follows me marcello 

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:10.039
 paciucci because I am also seeing you have 

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:14.330
 renamed a bit of garibaldi vichy 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:17.410
 that and manhole chernobyl virus deadly 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:20.630
 from a to z a meter give le 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:22.010
 directions and we also see this area 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:25.010
 lampedusa 2 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:28.370
 in short they were also redone 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:31.060
 a map of the city with a pinch 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:33.560
 of irony but that certainly is 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:37.299
 symptomatic of a general state of 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:37.299
 malaise of residents
