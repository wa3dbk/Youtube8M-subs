00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.270
 according to 6h17 on 7 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:59.800

 he is above his m 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.690
 it appears from these two civilians 

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:36.580
 but it will probably be necessary 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:39.580
 tens of thousands 

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:43.230

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:46.750

 the Swiss silvan zurbriggen 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:06.230
 but it is also used 

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:08.049
 by then 

00:02:08.049 --> 00:02:12.149
 they broke the interests of my country and the Muslim world 

00:02:12.149 --> 00:02:13.759
 but it is difficult 

00:02:13.759 --> 00:02:15.520
