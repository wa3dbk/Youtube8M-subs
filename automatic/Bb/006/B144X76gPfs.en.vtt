gauge comm and today I'm going to show
you<00:00:05.490> guys<00:00:05.819> a<00:00:06.350> neat<00:00:07.350> little<00:00:07.529> feature<00:00:07.890> that<00:00:08.300> Lyon

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:09.300 
you guys a neat little feature that Lyon

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.799 
you guys a neat little feature that Lyon
has<00:00:10.190> running<00:00:11.190> on<00:00:11.429> Macintosh<00:00:12.059> computers

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
has running on Macintosh computers

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:17.529 
has running on Macintosh computers
it's<00:00:13.500> called<00:00:13.860> airdrop<00:00:14.309> and<00:00:15.770> most<00:00:16.770> of<00:00:16.949> the<00:00:17.039> new

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:17.539 
it's called airdrop and most of the new

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:21.560 
it's called airdrop and most of the new
computers<00:00:18.859> 2010<00:00:19.859> and<00:00:20.220> up<00:00:20.460> I<00:00:20.640> believe<00:00:20.970> will

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
computers 2010 and up I believe will

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.429 
computers 2010 and up I believe will
support<00:00:21.990> it<00:00:22.230> right<00:00:22.859> out<00:00:23.010> the<00:00:23.160> box<00:00:23.400> but<00:00:24.390> on<00:00:24.779> your

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
support it right out the box but on your

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:29.000 
support it right out the box but on your
older<00:00:25.769> computers<00:00:26.250> 2010<00:00:27.180> and<00:00:27.330> older<00:00:28.010> they

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
older computers 2010 and older they

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.060 
older computers 2010 and older they
don't<00:00:29.519> support<00:00:29.730> Apple<00:00:30.449> just<00:00:30.779> didn't<00:00:31.320> couldn't

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
don't support Apple just didn't couldn't

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:33.560 
don't support Apple just didn't couldn't
I<00:00:32.309> guess<00:00:32.550> they<00:00:32.730> didn't<00:00:32.910> want<00:00:32.940> to<00:00:33.090> support<00:00:33.210> it

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
I guess they didn't want to support it

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.770 
I guess they didn't want to support it
because<00:00:33.870> it<00:00:34.500> doesn't<00:00:35.130> have<00:00:35.280> the<00:00:35.489> new<00:00:35.780> Wi-Fi

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
because it doesn't have the new Wi-Fi

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.340 
because it doesn't have the new Wi-Fi
features<00:00:37.200> that<00:00:37.380> allow<00:00:38.040> the<00:00:38.100> airdrop<00:00:38.610> to<00:00:38.790> work

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:39.350 
features that allow the airdrop to work

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:44.569 
features that allow the airdrop to work
seamlessly<00:00:40.370> so<00:00:42.140> if<00:00:43.140> you<00:00:43.500> look<00:00:43.680> here<00:00:43.710> on<00:00:44.010> my<00:00:44.040> new

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
seamlessly so if you look here on my new

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.680 
seamlessly so if you look here on my new
MacBook<00:00:45.090> Air<00:00:45.329> and<00:00:45.719> I<00:00:46.320> go<00:00:46.500> to<00:00:46.559> finder<00:00:47.690> you'll

says airdrop and you'll see that there's
a<00:00:53.280> circle<00:00:54.120> here<00:00:54.360> with<00:00:54.539> your<00:00:54.719> name<00:00:54.870> on<00:00:55.110> it<00:00:55.140> of

on my older iMac if I go to finder I
don't<00:01:48.720> have<00:01:48.990> airdrop<00:01:49.619> it<00:01:49.770> doesn't<00:01:50.040> support<00:01:50.369> it

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
don't have airdrop it doesn't support it

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:53.719 
don't have airdrop it doesn't support it
so<00:01:51.180> there's<00:01:51.689> an<00:01:51.810> easy<00:01:51.960> way<00:01:52.110> to<00:01:52.290> to<00:01:53.100> make<00:01:53.310> your

00:03:46.949 --> 00:03:46.959 
could do the same thing back so I can

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:52.650 
could do the same thing back so I can
send<00:03:47.319> this<00:03:47.500> one<00:03:47.709> to<00:03:48.639> my<00:03:49.540> Mac<00:03:50.730> ok<00:03:51.730> so<00:03:51.970> this<00:03:52.480> is

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:52.660 
send this one to my Mac ok so this is

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:54.090 
send this one to my Mac ok so this is
one<00:03:52.810> of<00:03:52.959> the<00:03:53.019> problems<00:03:53.470> and<00:03:53.620> this<00:03:53.680> is<00:03:53.739> probably

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:54.100 
one of the problems and this is probably

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:57.960 
one of the problems and this is probably
why<00:03:55.139> Apple<00:03:56.139> ended<00:03:56.650> up<00:03:56.799> not<00:03:57.250> letting<00:03:57.459> the<00:03:57.730> older

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:57.970 
why Apple ended up not letting the older

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:01.530 
why Apple ended up not letting the older
Macintosh<00:03:58.420> computers<00:03:58.930> um<00:03:59.910> use<00:04:00.910> airdrop<00:04:01.180> is

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:01.540 
Macintosh computers um use airdrop is

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:04.470 
Macintosh computers um use airdrop is
because<00:04:01.870> as<00:04:02.079> you<00:04:02.470> could<00:04:02.620> see<00:04:02.859> the<00:04:03.250> my<00:04:04.090> older

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:04.480 
because as you could see the my older

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:06.479 
because as you could see the my older
Macintosh<00:04:05.019> computer<00:04:05.530> just<00:04:05.769> disappeared<00:04:06.370> off

copying the deactivate code so just
right-click<00:05:50.110> copy<00:05:50.350> it<00:05:50.650> and<00:05:50.800> then<00:05:51.360> go<00:05:52.360> to<00:05:52.420> the
