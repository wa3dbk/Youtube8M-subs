00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
me if they do that they don't have to

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.540 
me if they do that they don't have to
wait<00:00:46.050> another<00:00:46.230> 15<00:00:46.649> seconds<00:00:47.039> before<00:00:47.190> they<00:00:47.430> can

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
wait another 15 seconds before they can

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:48.920 
wait another 15 seconds before they can
go<00:00:47.670> back<00:00:47.850> into<00:00:47.969> what<00:00:48.180> it's<00:00:48.270> called<00:00:48.420> egg<00:00:48.660> mode

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
go back into what it's called egg mode

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.990 
go back into what it's called egg mode
once<00:00:49.800> they're<00:00:49.920> in<00:00:50.010> Begg<00:00:50.190> mode<00:00:50.370> you<00:00:50.520> can<00:00:50.789> then

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
once they're in Begg mode you can then

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.270 
once they're in Begg mode you can then
tame<00:00:51.270> them<00:00:51.590> says<00:00:52.590> try<00:00:52.800> and<00:00:52.890> get<00:00:53.010> these<00:00:53.129> guys

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
tame them says try and get these guys

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.889 
tame them says try and get these guys
both<00:00:53.640> into<00:00:54.090> it<00:00:55.309> okay<00:00:56.309> I<00:00:56.340> think<00:00:56.640> he's<00:00:56.910> now<00:00:57.239> once

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
both into it okay I think he's now once

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:59.420 
both into it okay I think he's now once
he's<00:00:58.079> hops<00:00:58.289> out<00:00:58.469> that's<00:00:58.770> it<00:00:58.920> so<00:00:59.070> you<00:00:59.160> have<00:00:59.340> to

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
he's hops out that's it so you have to

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.160 
he's hops out that's it so you have to
kind<00:00:59.640> of<00:00:59.670> walk<00:00:59.820> so<00:01:00.000> I<00:01:00.210> think<00:01:00.690> he's<00:01:00.780> dialed<00:01:01.020> away

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
kind of walk so I think he's dialed away

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:02.240 
kind of walk so I think he's dialed away
again<00:01:01.410> so<00:01:01.440> he's<00:01:01.770> gonna<00:01:01.859> have<00:01:01.920> to<00:01:02.039> wait<00:01:02.100> another

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
again so he's gonna have to wait another

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:03.200 
again so he's gonna have to wait another
15<00:01:02.699> seconds

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
15 seconds

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:04.640 
15 seconds
there's<00:01:03.899> probably<00:01:04.140> because<00:01:04.290> I<00:01:04.350> was<00:01:04.439> moving

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
there's probably because I was moving

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.050 
there's probably because I was moving
too<00:01:04.769> quickly<00:01:05.040> what<00:01:05.309> I'd<00:01:05.400> recommend<00:01:05.549> is

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
too quickly what I'd recommend is

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.160 
too quickly what I'd recommend is
sitting<00:01:06.750> shift<00:01:07.080> and<00:01:08.420> then<00:01:09.420> just<00:01:09.600> kind<00:01:09.810> of<00:01:09.869> wait

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
sitting shift and then just kind of wait

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.380 
sitting shift and then just kind of wait
for<00:01:10.200> them<00:01:10.890> to<00:01:11.070> come<00:01:11.310> so<00:01:11.610> now<00:01:11.880> I<00:01:11.909> believe<00:01:12.299> this

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
for them to come so now I believe this

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.090

the black markers round and yeah and
then<00:01:23.790> you<00:01:23.970> got<00:01:24.060> to<00:01:24.180> keep<00:01:24.689> clicking<00:01:25.049> with<00:01:25.170> the

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
then you got to keep clicking with the

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.530 
then you got to keep clicking with the
carrots<00:01:25.560> as<00:01:25.799> quickly<00:01:26.250> as<00:01:26.400> you<00:01:26.430> can<00:01:26.640> so<00:01:27.450> make

sure you have enough on you hopefully
this<00:01:29.520> guy's<00:01:29.729> I<00:01:30.060> think<00:01:30.390> we<00:01:30.479> tame<00:01:30.659> this<00:01:30.810> white

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
this guy's I think we tame this white

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:32.749 
this guy's I think we tame this white
one<00:01:31.290> but<00:01:31.470> I<00:01:31.530> don't<00:01:31.740> think<00:01:31.860> we<00:01:32.009> can<00:01:32.220> manage<00:01:32.400> tame

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
one but I don't think we can manage tame

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.929 
one but I don't think we can manage tame
this<00:01:32.970> one<00:01:33.829> so<00:01:34.829> sometimes<00:01:35.280> it<00:01:35.369> can<00:01:35.400> take<00:01:35.670> many

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
this one so sometimes it can take many

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:37.370 
this one so sometimes it can take many
carrots<00:01:36.390> sometimes<00:01:36.780> it<00:01:36.869> will<00:01:36.930> take<00:01:37.079> one<00:01:37.259> or

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
carrots sometimes it will take one or

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.730 
carrots sometimes it will take one or
two<00:01:37.590> or<00:01:38.220> one<00:01:38.460> or<00:01:38.579> two<00:01:38.610> attempts<00:01:39.560> so<00:01:40.560> it<00:01:40.650> is

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
two or one or two attempts so it is

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.499 
two or one or two attempts so it is
pretty<00:01:40.979> challenging<00:01:41.280> the<00:01:41.909> only<00:01:42.150> way<00:01:42.270> you<00:01:42.329> can

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
pretty challenging the only way you can

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.389 
pretty challenging the only way you can
kind<00:01:42.720> of<00:01:42.780> tell<00:01:43.380> that<00:01:43.560> I've<00:01:43.710> noticed<00:01:43.979> whether

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
kind of tell that I've noticed whether

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.310 
kind of tell that I've noticed whether
they're<00:01:44.640> tamed<00:01:44.909> or<00:01:45.090> not<00:01:45.299> is<00:01:45.659> whether<00:01:46.079> they

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
they're tamed or not is whether they

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.770 
they're tamed or not is whether they
breed<00:01:46.619> once<00:01:46.890> you've<00:01:47.159> fed<00:01:47.670> them<00:01:47.790> both<00:01:47.939> so<00:01:48.299> as

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
breed once you've fed them both so as

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.179 
breed once you've fed them both so as
hopefully<00:01:49.380> these<00:01:49.530> guys<00:01:49.590> will<00:01:49.829> get<00:01:50.130> back<00:01:50.280> in<00:01:50.460> to

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:52.189 
hopefully these guys will get back in to

00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:54.740 
hopefully these guys will get back in to
see<00:01:53.189> if<00:01:53.220> he's<00:01:53.399> gonna<00:01:53.520> hop<00:01:53.759> back<00:01:53.909> over<00:01:54.030> I'm

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
see if he's gonna hop back over I'm

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:55.940 
see if he's gonna hop back over I'm
pretty<00:01:54.990> sure<00:01:55.110> this<00:01:55.229> one's<00:01:55.409> time<00:01:55.590> because<00:01:55.860> he's

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
pretty sure this one's time because he's

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.920 
pretty sure this one's time because he's
not<00:01:56.070> ran<00:01:56.250> away<00:01:56.369> so<00:01:57.149> we<00:01:57.240> just<00:01:57.450> kind<00:01:57.659> of<00:01:57.719> want<00:01:57.899> to

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
not ran away so we just kind of want to

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.789 
not ran away so we just kind of want to
get<00:01:58.049> this<00:01:58.229> one<00:01:58.439> over<00:01:58.740> here<00:01:59.509> hopefully<00:02:00.509> in<00:02:00.840> Begg

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
get this one over here hopefully in Begg

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:06.910 
get this one over here hopefully in Begg
mode<00:02:02.509> so<00:02:03.509> this<00:02:03.630> was<00:02:03.810> definitely<00:02:03.990> definitely

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:06.920 
mode so this was definitely definitely

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.260 
mode so this was definitely definitely
okay<00:02:07.920> I<00:02:07.950> guess<00:02:08.250> so<00:02:08.429> once<00:02:08.610> again<00:02:08.819> I<00:02:08.849> didn't<00:02:09.179> do

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
okay I guess so once again I didn't do

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.059 
okay I guess so once again I didn't do
it<00:02:09.390> right<00:02:09.569> this<00:02:10.319> one's<00:02:10.530> definitely<00:02:10.679> tame

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
it right this one's definitely tame

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:12.260 
it right this one's definitely tame
though<00:02:11.310> because<00:02:11.580> he's<00:02:11.700> not<00:02:11.849> absolute<00:02:12.180> he's

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
though because he's not absolute he's

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.490 
though because he's not absolute he's
not<00:02:12.420> scared<00:02:12.660> at<00:02:12.750> all<00:02:12.870> we<00:02:13.050> just<00:02:13.170> need<00:02:13.290> to<00:02:13.379> wait

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
not scared at all we just need to wait

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.850 
not scared at all we just need to wait
for<00:02:13.530> the

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
for the

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.430 
for the
Haas<00:02:14.070> had<00:02:14.400> dynam<00:02:14.850> from<00:02:15.090> to<00:02:15.210> hop<00:02:15.360> back<00:02:15.480> over<00:02:15.660> so

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
Haas had dynam from to hop back over so

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:17.750 
Haas had dynam from to hop back over so
eager<00:02:16.680> I<00:02:16.740> believe<00:02:16.980> now<00:02:17.130> he's<00:02:17.280> in<00:02:17.370> bed<00:02:17.550> mode

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
eager I believe now he's in bed mode

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.820 
eager I believe now he's in bed mode
against<00:02:18.090> there<00:02:18.330> if<00:02:18.510> we<00:02:18.630> spam<00:02:18.900> click<00:02:19.170> and<00:02:19.470> now

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
against there if we spam click and now

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:21.530 
against there if we spam click and now
think<00:02:20.130> that<00:02:20.280> he<00:02:20.400> is<00:02:20.520> tame<00:02:20.730> so<00:02:20.970> if<00:02:21.060> we<00:02:21.180> breed<00:02:21.420> the

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
think that he is tame so if we breed the

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:24.020 
think that he is tame so if we breed the
two<00:02:21.720> clicker<00:02:21.990> make<00:02:22.410> the<00:02:22.530> to<00:02:22.680> having<00:02:23.190> Haas<00:02:23.370> then

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
two clicker make the to having Haas then

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:25.340 
two clicker make the to having Haas then
they<00:02:24.240> should<00:02:24.570> there<00:02:24.870> we<00:02:24.990> go

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:25.350 
they should there we go

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:28.310 
they should there we go
they've<00:02:25.830> bred<00:02:26.160> so<00:02:26.670> it<00:02:26.940> is<00:02:27.420> really<00:02:27.810> easy<00:02:27.960> to<00:02:28.080> do

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:28.320 
they've bred so it is really easy to do

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:31.940 
they've bred so it is really easy to do
but<00:02:29.220> it's<00:02:29.400> just<00:02:29.460> the<00:02:29.790> initial<00:02:30.680> getting<00:02:31.680> them

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
but it's just the initial getting them

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:35.830 
but it's just the initial getting them
to<00:02:32.100> taint<00:02:32.400> in<00:02:32.580> taming<00:02:32.970> them<00:02:33.120> is<00:02:33.270> the<00:02:33.390> challenge

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:35.840 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:38.600 

so<00:02:36.840> yeah<00:02:37.020> I<00:02:37.530> hope<00:02:37.860> they're<00:02:38.040> kind<00:02:38.190> of<00:02:38.220> help<00:02:38.520> just

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580 
and then you can use go on character or

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:47.000 
and then you can use go on character or
dandy<00:02:44.910> lines<00:02:45.120> as<00:02:45.360> well<00:02:45.600> as<00:02:45.900> carrots<00:02:46.260> for<00:02:46.830> I'm

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
dandy lines as well as carrots for I'm

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:51.080 
dandy lines as well as carrots for I'm
actually<00:02:47.459> breeding<00:02:47.910> them<00:02:48.230> so<00:02:49.230> can<00:02:49.770> see<00:02:50.090> yeah

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
actually breeding them so can see yeah

actually breeding them so can see yeah
so<00:02:51.240> these<00:02:51.360> two<00:02:51.480> definitely<00:02:51.750> tame<00:02:52.050> so<00:02:52.200> what<00:02:52.320> I'd

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380 
so these two definitely tame so what I'd

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:54.080 
so these two definitely tame so what I'd
recommend<00:02:52.530> is<00:02:52.770> just<00:02:52.950> keep<00:02:53.130> tame<00:02:53.610> rabbits<00:02:54.000> in

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
recommend is just keep tame rabbits in

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:56.260 
recommend is just keep tame rabbits in
one<00:02:54.239> place<00:02:54.480> and<00:02:54.810> non<00:02:55.320> ten<00:02:55.560> ones<00:02:55.739> in<00:02:55.860> another

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:56.270 
one place and non ten ones in another

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:58.760 
one place and non ten ones in another
even<00:02:57.270> if<00:02:57.360> they're<00:02:57.480> not<00:02:57.630> tamed<00:02:57.900> you<00:02:58.080> can<00:02:58.410> attach

00:02:58.760 --> 00:02:58.770 
even if they're not tamed you can attach

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:00.500 
even if they're not tamed you can attach
a<00:02:58.890> lead<00:02:59.070> and<00:02:59.340> drag<00:02:59.640> them<00:02:59.760> around<00:02:59.880> so<00:03:00.209> you<00:03:00.300> can

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
a lead and drag them around so you can

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:02.150 
a lead and drag them around so you can
kind<00:03:00.750> of<00:03:00.840> still<00:03:00.989> move<00:03:01.230> them<00:03:01.500> to<00:03:01.680> locate<00:03:01.980> to

kind of still move them to locate to
wherever<00:03:02.340> they<00:03:02.520> need<00:03:02.670> to<00:03:02.820> be<00:03:04.310> so<00:03:05.310> you<00:03:05.400> can<00:03:05.520> see
