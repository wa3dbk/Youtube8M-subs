00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:07.440

 edra Shcherbakova 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.680
 but then suddenly refused 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:25.019
 talk judge Zeynalov said that 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.599

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:34.350
 Moscow court now works our 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.370
 correspondent Valery Alekhina and both relays 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.260
 now it appeared unexpectedly 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.090
 information about what's there today 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.649

 Zeinalov was supposed to start at 12 o'clock 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.760
 but quite unexpectedly at this time in 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.350
 the hall held a completely different person 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:57.629
 as we found out this is some mahomed 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.920
 churilov one of the leaders of the very 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:01.829
 vegetable base in turquoise 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.489

 taken went unprecedented action 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:24.900
 security is most likely related 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:27.229
 so that Zeynalov still detained himself 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.520
 behaved very aggressively and possibly 

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:31.220
 law enforcement also feared some 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.470
