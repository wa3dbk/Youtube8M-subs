00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:44.540 
know maybe maybe like narrowed down like

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:46.539 
know maybe maybe like narrowed down like
20<00:03:44.780> region<00:03:45.260> because<00:03:45.739> it's<00:03:45.949> like<00:03:46.099> a<00:03:46.129> lot<00:03:46.340> easier

00:03:46.539 --> 00:03:46.549 
20 region because it's like a lot easier

00:03:46.549 --> 00:03:48.580 
20 region because it's like a lot easier
