00:00:55.989 --> 00:00:55.999 
so for example if you were writing your

00:00:55.999 --> 00:00:58.119 
so for example if you were writing your
own<00:00:56.149> music<00:00:56.329> it<00:00:57.049> would<00:00:57.260> be<00:00:57.379> a<00:00:57.409> way<00:00:57.649> of<00:00:57.679> keeping

00:00:58.119 --> 00:00:58.129 
own music it would be a way of keeping

00:00:58.129 --> 00:00:59.829 
own music it would be a way of keeping
track<00:00:58.549> of<00:00:58.609> what<00:00:58.909> you've<00:00:59.059> been<00:00:59.209> playing<00:00:59.449> you

is<00:01:01.699> useful<00:01:02.269> and<00:01:02.420> I<00:01:02.510> promise<00:01:02.989> you<00:01:03.139> it's<00:01:03.379> really

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:03.589 
is useful and I promise you it's really

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:05.800 
is useful and I promise you it's really
simple<00:01:04.070> it'll<00:01:04.729> only<00:01:04.879> take<00:01:05.030> me<00:01:05.180> five<00:01:05.479> minutes

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:05.810 
simple it'll only take me five minutes

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:07.510 
simple it'll only take me five minutes
to<00:01:05.990> explain<00:01:06.260> it<00:01:06.560> to<00:01:06.680> you<00:01:06.830> and<00:01:07.010> you'll<00:01:07.130> get<00:01:07.369> it

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:12.860 
lines now each one of those lines

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:15.490 
lines now each one of those lines

and the top line is the first string now
a<00:01:19.790> lot<00:01:20.150> of<00:01:20.180> my<00:01:20.390> students<00:01:20.870> get<00:01:21.050> confused<00:01:21.080> by

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:21.740 
a lot of my students get confused by

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:23.800 
a lot of my students get confused by
that<00:01:21.920> because<00:01:22.160> they<00:01:22.430> say<00:01:22.640> you<00:01:22.940> know<00:01:23.060> why<00:01:23.570> is<00:01:23.630> it

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:23.810 
that because they say you know why is it

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:26.290 
that because they say you know why is it
back<00:01:23.990> to<00:01:24.170> front<00:01:24.320> that<00:01:24.800> on<00:01:25.370> a<00:01:25.430> real<00:01:25.700> guitar<00:01:25.910> the

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:26.300 
back to front that on a real guitar the

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:27.940 
back to front that on a real guitar the
sixth<00:01:26.600> string<00:01:26.660> is<00:01:26.960> at<00:01:27.080> the<00:01:27.170> top<00:01:27.350> and<00:01:27.650> the<00:01:27.740> first

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:27.950 
sixth string is at the top and the first

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:29.500 
sixth string is at the top and the first
rings<00:01:28.160> at<00:01:28.250> the<00:01:28.340> bottom<00:01:28.730> so<00:01:28.910> why<00:01:29.060> did<00:01:29.270> they<00:01:29.360> do

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:29.510 
rings at the bottom so why did they do

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:31.630 
rings at the bottom so why did they do
it<00:01:29.540> the<00:01:29.720> other<00:01:29.750> way<00:01:29.900> round<00:01:29.990> and<00:01:30.500> my<00:01:31.100> answer<00:01:31.340> is

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:31.640 
it the other way round and my answer is

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:33.760 
it the other way round and my answer is
I<00:01:32.120> don't<00:01:32.150> know<00:01:32.480> I<00:01:32.600> didn't<00:01:33.080> design<00:01:33.380> the<00:01:33.590> system

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:33.770 
I don't know I didn't design the system

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:36.130 
I don't know I didn't design the system
but<00:01:34.400> what<00:01:34.790> I<00:01:34.820> will<00:01:35.000> say<00:01:35.060> is<00:01:35.300> don't<00:01:35.570> worry<00:01:35.780> about

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:36.140 
but what I will say is don't worry about

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:37.930 
but what I will say is don't worry about
it<00:01:36.320> because<00:01:36.470> you'll<00:01:36.800> quickly<00:01:37.100> get<00:01:37.400> used<00:01:37.640> to<00:01:37.820> it

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:37.940 
it because you'll quickly get used to it

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:39.130 
it because you'll quickly get used to it

now<00:01:44.240> what<00:01:44.420> happens<00:01:44.870> is<00:01:45.080> we<00:01:45.320> put<00:01:45.500> a<00:01:45.530> number<00:01:45.830> on

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:46.340 
now what happens is we put a number on

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:48.580 
now what happens is we put a number on
the<00:01:46.880> line<00:01:47.120> and<00:01:47.510> the<00:01:47.540> number<00:01:47.900> represents<00:01:48.470> the

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:48.590 
the line and the number represents the

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:51.160 
the line and the number represents the
fret<00:01:48.860> we<00:01:49.010> playing<00:01:49.280> so<00:01:49.909> for<00:01:50.090> example<00:01:50.120> if<00:01:50.750> we

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:51.170 
fret we playing so for example if we

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:52.480 
fret we playing so for example if we
were<00:01:51.320> to<00:01:51.440> play<00:01:51.620> the<00:01:51.770> sixth<00:01:52.100> string<00:01:52.190> at<00:01:52.460> fret

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:52.490 
were to play the sixth string at fret

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:56.190 
were to play the sixth string at fret
one<00:01:53.320> what<00:01:54.320> you<00:01:54.440> would<00:01:54.560> see<00:01:54.770> is<00:01:54.920> this

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:56.200 
one what you would see is this

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:59.520 
one what you would see is this
the<00:01:57.009> number<00:01:57.369> one<00:01:57.610> on<00:01:57.909> the<00:01:58.750> bottom<00:01:58.930> line<00:01:59.289> of

00:01:59.520 --> 00:01:59.530 
the number one on the bottom line of

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:01.499 
the number one on the bottom line of
course<00:01:59.740> that<00:01:59.950> represents<00:02:00.460> fret<00:02:00.700> one<00:02:00.939> on<00:02:01.210> the

00:02:01.499 --> 00:02:01.509 
course that represents fret one on the

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:03.810 
course that represents fret one on the
sixth<00:02:01.810> string<00:02:01.840> and<00:02:02.289> if<00:02:03.070> we<00:02:03.219> were<00:02:03.310> to<00:02:03.340> play<00:02:03.549> fret

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:03.820 
sixth string and if we were to play fret

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:06.840 
sixth string and if we were to play fret
2<00:02:04.030> on<00:02:04.270> the<00:02:04.360> sixth<00:02:04.630> string<00:02:05.250> ET<00:02:06.250> and<00:02:06.399> number<00:02:06.640> two

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
you another example the second string at

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:21.630 
you another example the second string at
fret<00:02:17.950> 3<00:02:19.380> you'd<00:02:20.380> see<00:02:20.590> a<00:02:20.620> number<00:02:20.860> three<00:02:21.310> on<00:02:21.340> the

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:21.640 
fret 3 you'd see a number three on the

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:25.699 
fret 3 you'd see a number three on the
second<00:02:22.209> line<00:02:22.739> the<00:02:23.739> fifth<00:02:24.010> string<00:02:24.220> at<00:02:24.519> fret<00:02:24.549> too

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:25.709 
second line the fifth string at fret too

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:28.350 
second line the fifth string at fret too
you'd<00:02:26.709> see<00:02:26.890> a<00:02:26.920> number<00:02:27.129> two<00:02:27.459> on<00:02:27.760> the<00:02:27.790> fifth<00:02:28.180> line

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:28.360 
you'd see a number two on the fifth line

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.440 
you'd see a number two on the fifth line
okay<00:02:28.989> so<00:02:29.049> that<00:02:29.319> is<00:02:29.349> it<00:02:29.500> it<00:02:29.799> straightforward
