Froch three times you can just leave you

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:44.740 
Froch three times you can just leave you
know<00:02:41.840> leave<00:02:42.650> Duke<00:02:43.160> in<00:02:43.370> chest<00:02:43.640> you<00:02:44.330> can<00:02:44.540> just

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:49.780 
reload it and you can get started all
again<00:02:48.080> so<00:02:48.320> that's<00:02:48.560> something<00:02:48.980> I<00:02:49.280> really<00:02:49.519> think

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:49.790 
again so that's something I really think

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:52.750 
again so that's something I really think
is<00:02:50.000> a<00:02:50.030> quite<00:02:50.540> a<00:02:50.570> nice<00:02:50.840> bonus<00:02:51.489> because<00:02:52.489> you<00:02:52.640> know

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:52.760 
is a quite a nice bonus because you know

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:54.370 
is a quite a nice bonus because you know
if<00:02:52.910> it<00:02:53.239> was<00:02:53.420> you<00:02:53.510> had<00:02:53.690> to<00:02:53.720> expend<00:02:54.110> the<00:02:54.230> clip

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:54.380 
if it was you had to expend the clip

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:56.290 
if it was you had to expend the clip
every<00:02:54.620> time<00:02:54.800> it<00:02:54.920> wouldn't<00:02:55.220> be<00:02:55.340> nearly<00:02:55.580> as<00:02:55.790> fun

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:56.300 
every time it wouldn't be nearly as fun

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:58.210 
every time it wouldn't be nearly as fun
so<00:02:56.540> you<00:02:56.989> could<00:02:57.230> have<00:02:57.260> your<00:02:57.380> first<00:02:57.709> two<00:02:57.950> or

00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:58.220 
so you could have your first two or

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:59.949 
so you could have your first two or
three<00:02:58.430> rounds<00:02:58.880> be<00:02:59.060> all<00:02:59.330> the<00:02:59.480> bonus<00:02:59.780> damage

00:02:59.949 --> 00:02:59.959 
three rounds be all the bonus damage

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:02.140 
three rounds be all the bonus damage
that<00:03:00.320> you<00:03:00.440> can<00:03:00.620> put<00:03:00.830> out<00:03:00.980> reload<00:03:01.700> that<00:03:01.730> thing

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:02.150 
that you can put out reload that thing

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:03.880 
that you can put out reload that thing
and<00:03:02.330> then<00:03:02.570> start<00:03:03.350> going<00:03:03.590> to<00:03:03.680> town<00:03:03.709> on

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:03.890 
and then start going to town on

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:06.340 
and then start going to town on
everybody<00:03:04.430> again<00:03:04.790> and<00:03:05.030> that<00:03:05.840> is<00:03:06.050> one<00:03:06.230> of<00:03:06.290> the

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:06.350 
everybody again and that is one of the

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:07.900 
everybody again and that is one of the
reasons<00:03:06.620> why<00:03:06.709> the<00:03:06.769> hawk<00:03:06.980> moon<00:03:07.190> is<00:03:07.370> so<00:03:07.550> kind<00:03:07.790> of

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:07.910 
reasons why the hawk moon is so kind of

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:10.600 
reasons why the hawk moon is so kind of
coveted<00:03:08.330> and<00:03:08.510> enjoyable<00:03:09.100> if<00:03:10.100> you<00:03:10.400> are<00:03:10.579> a
