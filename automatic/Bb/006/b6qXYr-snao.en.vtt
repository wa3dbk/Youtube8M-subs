they're looking for and feel with when

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:24.830 
they're looking for and feel with when
they<00:03:21.750> play<00:03:22.050> and<00:03:22.470> that<00:03:23.280> type<00:03:23.580> of<00:03:23.610> thing<00:03:23.940> but<00:03:23.970> you

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:31.110 
have the option to go with either or

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:33.530 
have the option to go with either or
because<00:03:31.740> when<00:03:31.890> you<00:03:32.040> buy<00:03:32.250> them<00:03:32.610> you'll<00:03:33.240> get

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:33.540 
because when you buy them you'll get

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:38.780 
because when you buy them you'll get
both<00:03:33.750> anyway<00:03:34.230> so<00:03:35.570> but<00:03:36.570> that's<00:03:36.750> pretty<00:03:37.080> much<00:03:37.260> it

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:38.790 
both anyway so but that's pretty much it

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:41.840
