so they live on the pitch and the rocks
and<00:00:28.769> the<00:00:28.859> beaches<00:00:29.099> of<00:00:29.460> South<00:00:29.670> America<00:00:32.660> let<00:00:33.660> me

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
and the beaches of South America let me

so<00:00:42.660> let<00:00:42.809> me<00:00:42.930> decide<00:00:43.230> the<00:00:43.440> enclosure<00:00:43.980> there

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
so let me decide the enclosure there

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:45.709 
so let me decide the enclosure there
behind<00:00:44.309> me<00:00:44.700> you<00:00:44.820> have<00:00:44.850> to<00:00:45.149> think<00:00:45.360> about<00:00:45.450> how

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
behind me you have to think about how

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.540 
behind me you have to think about how
they<00:00:45.899> live<00:00:46.140> so<00:00:46.920> the<00:00:47.039> course<00:00:47.280> there's<00:00:47.520> a

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
they live so the course there's a

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.310 
they live so the course there's a
separate<00:00:47.940> lecture<00:00:48.090> solving<00:00:48.570> on<00:00:48.750> the<00:00:48.840> walk<00:00:49.020> so

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
separate lecture solving on the walk so

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.260 
separate lecture solving on the walk so
we<00:00:49.440> need<00:00:49.590> you<00:00:49.680> two<00:00:49.829> nice<00:00:50.010> big<00:00:50.250> bucks<00:00:50.520> for<00:00:51.149> that

we need you two nice big bucks for that

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.049 
we need you two nice big bucks for that
very<00:00:51.510> purpose<00:00:52.039> but<00:00:53.039> also<00:00:53.219> once<00:00:53.610> you<00:00:53.730> get<00:00:53.910> to

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059

very purpose but also once you get to
the<00:00:54.149> mid<00:00:54.360> game<00:00:55.430> because<00:00:56.430> a<00:00:56.460> bit<00:00:56.699> too<00:00:56.940> hot<00:00:57.210> they

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
the mid game because a bit too hot they

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:11.149 
the mid game because a bit too hot they
need<00:00:57.780> somewhere<00:00:58.140> to<00:00:58.199> shave<00:01:09.470> because<00:01:10.470> hundreds

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
need somewhere to shave because hundreds

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.370 
need somewhere to shave because hundreds
of<00:01:11.310> them<00:01:11.490> in<00:01:11.670> colonies<00:01:12.240> and<00:01:12.420> so<00:01:12.630> these<00:01:12.990> the

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
of them in colonies and so these the

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.710 
of them in colonies and so these the
problem<00:01:13.890> of<00:01:14.250> human<00:01:14.640> will<00:01:14.880> build<00:01:15.210> up<00:01:15.390> quite<00:01:15.659> the

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
problem of human will build up quite the

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.260 
problem of human will build up quite the
play<00:01:16.080> of<00:01:16.229> fabric<00:01:16.710> rushed<00:01:17.040> the<00:01:17.670> Penguins<00:01:18.090> will

Willoughby's is their guano as I
mentioned<00:02:23.700> it<00:02:23.790> builds<00:02:24.060> upon<00:02:24.090> the<00:02:24.300> box<00:02:24.540> and

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
mentioned it builds upon the box and

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:26.630 
mentioned it builds upon the box and
they<00:02:25.050> dig<00:02:25.260> down<00:02:25.470> into<00:02:25.650> it<00:02:25.830> to<00:02:25.980> lay<00:02:26.130> their<00:02:26.370> eggs

they dig down into it to lay their eggs

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.210

this<00:02:29.340> guano<00:02:29.700> makes<00:02:30.060> fantastic<00:02:30.380> fertilizer<00:02:31.380> so

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
this guano makes fantastic fertilizer so

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:34.670 
this guano makes fantastic fertilizer so
they<00:02:32.670> take<00:02:33.390> it<00:02:33.450> all<00:02:33.660> in<00:02:33.810> they<00:02:33.930> harvest<00:02:34.380> it<00:02:34.530> may

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
they take it all in they harvest it may

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:37.040 
they take it all in they harvest it may
put<00:02:34.890> it<00:02:35.040> on<00:02:35.160> their<00:02:35.340> crops<00:02:35.580> and<00:02:36.030> it's<00:02:36.570> great<00:02:36.900> for

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.050 
put it on their crops and it's great for

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:38.600 
put it on their crops and it's great for
that<00:02:37.170> big<00:02:37.380> it<00:02:37.500> might<00:02:37.680> have<00:02:37.890> big<00:02:38.040> crops<00:02:38.340> all

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
that big it might have big crops all

that big it might have big crops all
year<00:02:38.790> round<00:02:39.030> but<00:02:39.900> the<00:02:40.020> plane<00:02:40.230> would<00:02:40.470> have<00:02:40.500> been

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:40.740 
year round but the plane would have been

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:43.490 
year round but the plane would have been
got<00:02:40.890> nowhere<00:02:41.280> to<00:02:41.430> lay<00:02:41.610> their<00:02:41.850> eggs<00:02:42.120> and<00:02:42.570> so

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
got nowhere to lay their eggs and so

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:45.650 
got nowhere to lay their eggs and so
that<00:02:43.920> means<00:02:44.130> less<00:02:44.340> penguins<00:02:44.880> each<00:02:45.060> year<00:02:45.360> who

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
that means less penguins each year who

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:48.130 
that means less penguins each year who
lay<00:02:45.840> their<00:02:45.870> eggs<00:02:46.230> at<00:02:46.410> have<00:02:46.590> you<00:02:46.730> unless<00:02:47.730> young
