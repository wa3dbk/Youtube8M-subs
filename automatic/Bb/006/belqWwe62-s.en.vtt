hello my name is Ron went through the
wire<00:00:12.179> USA<00:00:12.690> and<00:00:12.960> in<00:00:13.080> this<00:00:13.200> video<00:00:13.559> I'm<00:00:13.740> going<00:00:13.830> to

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
wire USA and in this video I'm going to

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:16.160 
wire USA and in this video I'm going to
show<00:00:14.099> you<00:00:14.130> how<00:00:14.460> to<00:00:14.519> use<00:00:14.759> one<00:00:15.000> of<00:00:15.030> our<00:00:15.240> one<00:00:15.960> by

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
show you how to use one of our one by

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.240 
show you how to use one of our one by
two<00:00:16.640> DisplayPort<00:00:17.640> to<00:00:17.699> HDMI<00:00:17.840> splitters<00:00:19.250> the

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
two DisplayPort to HDMI splitters the

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.359 
two DisplayPort to HDMI splitters the
splitter<00:00:20.609> allows<00:00:20.970> you<00:00:21.180> to<00:00:21.330> take<00:00:21.539> one

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:22.369 
splitter allows you to take one

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:26.689 
splitter allows you to take one
DisplayPort<00:00:23.369> signal<00:00:23.850> and<00:00:24.890> split<00:00:25.890> it<00:00:26.010> to<00:00:26.250> two

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
DisplayPort signal and split it to two

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:32.930 
DisplayPort signal and split it to two
hdmi<00:00:27.570> signals<00:00:29.449> now<00:00:30.449> you<00:00:30.539> can<00:00:31.550> view<00:00:32.550> the<00:00:32.700> same

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
hdmi signals now you can view the same

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.510 
hdmi signals now you can view the same
signal<00:00:33.390> on<00:00:33.510> two<00:00:33.719> different<00:00:33.899> displays<00:00:34.440> or<00:00:34.829> you

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
signal on two different displays or you

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.720 
signal on two different displays or you
can<00:00:35.760> do<00:00:36.000> what<00:00:36.239> is<00:00:36.329> called<00:00:36.390> extend<00:00:37.050> mode<00:00:37.730> where

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
can do what is called extend mode where

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:44.650 
can do what is called extend mode where
you<00:00:39.050> use<00:00:40.050> two<00:00:40.980> monitors<00:00:41.540> in<00:00:42.540> as<00:00:43.110> one<00:00:43.829> monitor

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:44.660 
you use two monitors in as one monitor

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:50.470 
you use two monitors in as one monitor
to<00:00:45.660> a<00:00:45.690> resolution<00:00:46.200> of<00:00:46.440> up<00:00:46.620> to<00:00:46.940> 38<00:00:47.940> 40<00:00:48.420> by<00:00:48.719> 1080

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:50.480 
to a resolution of up to 38 40 by 1080

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:52.580 
to a resolution of up to 38 40 by 1080
now<00:00:51.480> the<00:00:51.539> first<00:00:51.840> thing<00:00:51.960> that<00:00:52.140> we'll<00:00:52.260> do<00:00:52.410> is

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
now the first thing that we'll do is

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.750 
now the first thing that we'll do is
I'll<00:00:52.710> plug<00:00:52.980> in<00:00:53.100> the<00:00:53.190> power<00:00:55.250> I'll<00:00:56.250> plug<00:00:56.520> in<00:00:56.670> the

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
I'll plug in the power I'll plug in the

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:02.420 
I'll plug in the power I'll plug in the
cable<00:00:57.149> coming<00:00:57.539> from<00:00:57.780> the<00:00:58.170> PC<00:00:58.710> to<00:00:59.129> the<00:00:59.370> input<00:01:01.430> on

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
cable coming from the PC to the input on

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.420 
cable coming from the PC to the input on
the<00:01:02.609> in<00:01:02.730> it

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:04.430 
the in it

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:07.720 
the in it
and<00:01:04.910> I'll<00:01:05.030> plug<00:01:05.270> this<00:01:05.750> monitor<00:01:06.290> into<00:01:06.770> output

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:07.730 
and I'll plug this monitor into output

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:12.550 
and I'll plug this monitor into output
one

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:12.560 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:16.430 

go<00:01:13.560> ahead<00:01:13.799> and<00:01:13.950> plug<00:01:14.159> in<00:01:14.630> that<00:01:15.630> one<00:01:15.869> an<00:01:16.020> output

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:16.440 
go ahead and plug in that one an output

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:23.760 
go ahead and plug in that one an output
to

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:23.770 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:26.780 

now<00:01:24.340> as<00:01:24.490> you<00:01:24.579> can<00:01:24.759> see<00:01:25.030> we're<00:01:25.360> in<00:01:25.390> clone<00:01:26.110> mode

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
now as you can see we're in clone mode

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.730 
now as you can see we're in clone mode
is<00:01:27.790> basically<00:01:27.850> the<00:01:28.509> same<00:01:28.780> signal<00:01:29.500> being

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:29.740 
is basically the same signal being

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:33.060 
is basically the same signal being
viewed<00:01:29.979> on<00:01:30.250> two<00:01:30.670> different<00:01:30.850> monitors<00:01:31.979> now<00:01:32.979> I'm

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:33.070 
viewed on two different monitors now I'm

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:37.380 
viewed on two different monitors now I'm
going<00:01:33.220> to<00:01:33.310> go<00:01:33.460> to<00:01:34.649> display<00:01:35.649> settings<00:01:36.390> and

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:37.390

you're going to notice here that you

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:41.429 
you're going to notice here that you
have<00:01:38.860> more<00:01:39.159> options<00:01:39.670> as<00:01:40.299> far<00:01:40.360> as<00:01:40.659> resolution

00:01:41.429 --> 00:01:41.439 
have more options as far as resolution

00:01:41.439 --> 00:01:44.789 
have more options as far as resolution
and<00:01:42.159> all<00:01:42.310> you<00:01:42.460> have<00:01:42.580> to<00:01:42.729> do<00:01:42.880> is<00:01:43.350> click<00:01:44.350> it<00:01:44.560> and

to the right and you're going to get a

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:56.399 
to the right and you're going to get a
resolution<00:01:52.630> of<00:01:52.920> 3840<00:01:53.920> by<00:01:54.100> 1080<00:01:55.020> then<00:01:56.020> you<00:01:56.229> just

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:56.409 
resolution of 3840 by 1080 then you just

click<00:01:56.619> OK<00:02:01.259> now<00:02:02.259> as<00:02:02.409> you<00:02:02.560> can<00:02:02.740> see<00:02:04.920> these<00:02:05.920> two

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
click OK now as you can see these two

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:11.900 
click OK now as you can see these two
monitors<00:02:07.750> are<00:02:08.080> basically<00:02:08.709> acting<00:02:09.190> as<00:02:09.340> one

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:14.330 

it's<00:02:12.910> not<00:02:13.090> just<00:02:13.390> an<00:02:13.540> extended<00:02:14.080> desktop

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
it's not just an extended desktop

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:17.880 
it's not just an extended desktop
because<00:02:15.340> if<00:02:15.459> I<00:02:15.580> maximize<00:02:16.239> this<00:02:16.450> here<00:02:16.840> it<00:02:17.709> will

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
because if I maximize this here it will

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:25.570 
because if I maximize this here it will
go<00:02:18.069> across<00:02:18.630> the<00:02:19.630> entire<00:02:20.519> both<00:02:21.519> monitors

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:25.580 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:31.960 

this<00:02:26.120> will<00:02:26.330> work<00:02:26.540> with<00:02:27.850> movies<00:02:28.850> games<00:02:30.760> it<00:02:31.760> all

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:31.970 
this will work with movies games it all

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:35.190 
this will work with movies games it all
pretty<00:02:32.180> much<00:02:32.360> works<00:02:32.630> the<00:02:32.810> same

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:40.450

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:40.460 
and again we're at 38 40 by 1080 and we

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:42.940 
and again we're at 38 40 by 1080 and we
do<00:02:40.640> have<00:02:40.940> this<00:02:41.300> splitter<00:02:42.080> available<00:02:42.680> and
