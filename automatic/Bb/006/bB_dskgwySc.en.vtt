bit different if you haven't done this
before<00:00:09.679> chromatic<00:00:10.679> scales<00:00:11.010> are<00:00:11.309> a<00:00:11.340> brilliant

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
before chromatic scales are a brilliant

exercise<00:00:12.809> for<00:00:13.049> you<00:00:13.139> to<00:00:13.170> work<00:00:13.380> on<00:00:13.620> they<00:00:14.250> cover

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
exercise for you to work on they cover

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:16.070 
exercise for you to work on they cover
every<00:00:14.940> note<00:00:15.120> on<00:00:15.360> the<00:00:15.450> instrument<00:00:15.839> in<00:00:15.900> fact

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
every note on the instrument in fact

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:17.450 
every note on the instrument in fact
that's<00:00:16.230> what<00:00:16.350> a<00:00:16.379> chromatic<00:00:16.680> scale<00:00:16.800> is<00:00:17.220> where

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
that's what a chromatic scale is where

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.790 
that's what a chromatic scale is where
we<00:00:17.550> go<00:00:17.640> from<00:00:17.820> one<00:00:18.029> note<00:00:18.240> up<00:00:18.720> in<00:00:19.080> half<00:00:19.320> steps<00:00:19.650> or

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
we go from one note up in half steps or

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.220 
we go from one note up in half steps or
semitones<00:00:20.279> all<00:00:20.520> the<00:00:20.850> way<00:00:21.000> up<00:00:21.210> so<00:00:21.960> it<00:00:22.080> means

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
semitones all the way up so it means

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:23.599 
semitones all the way up so it means
you're<00:00:22.410> going<00:00:22.500> to<00:00:22.560> play<00:00:22.740> every<00:00:23.160> note<00:00:23.340> on<00:00:23.490> the

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
you're going to play every note on the

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:25.880 
you're going to play every note on the
saxophone<00:00:24.150> and<00:00:24.390> it's<00:00:25.080> a<00:00:25.140> good<00:00:25.380> way<00:00:25.560> to<00:00:25.619> get

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
saxophone and it's a good way to get

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.439 
saxophone and it's a good way to get
your<00:00:26.070> fingers<00:00:26.460> warmed<00:00:26.730> up<00:00:26.849> as<00:00:27.000> well<00:00:27.150> because

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
your fingers warmed up as well because

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:28.910 
your fingers warmed up as well because
you're<00:00:27.599> moving<00:00:27.960> in<00:00:28.050> a<00:00:28.109> way<00:00:28.140> which<00:00:28.439> feels<00:00:28.740> a

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
you're moving in a way which feels a

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.609 
you're moving in a way which feels a
little<00:00:29.279> bit<00:00:29.460> unnatural<00:00:30.470> stretching<00:00:31.470> your

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
little bit unnatural stretching your

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:33.470 
little bit unnatural stretching your
fingers<00:00:31.769> in<00:00:32.099> different<00:00:32.430> directions<00:00:32.700> so<00:00:33.360> it's

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
fingers in different directions so it's

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.299 
fingers in different directions so it's
a<00:00:33.540> great<00:00:33.719> little<00:00:33.840> little<00:00:34.500> scale<00:00:34.800> to<00:00:34.920> practice

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
a great little little scale to practice

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:36.680 
a great little little scale to practice
the<00:00:35.790> other<00:00:35.910> thing<00:00:36.090> is<00:00:36.210> that<00:00:36.360> school<00:00:36.540> back

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
the other thing is that school back

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.270 
the other thing is that school back
chromatic<00:00:37.020> scales<00:00:37.230> is<00:00:37.440> there<00:00:37.680> are<00:00:37.860> one

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
chromatic scales is there are one

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.819 
chromatic scales is there are one
there's<00:00:38.670> only<00:00:38.910> one<00:00:39.239> chromatic<00:00:39.690> scale<00:00:39.930> how

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
there's only one chromatic scale how

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:41.990 
there's only one chromatic scale how
cool<00:00:41.070> is<00:00:41.190> that<00:00:41.219> you<00:00:41.520> don't<00:00:41.700> need<00:00:41.820> to<00:00:41.879> learn

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
cool is that you don't need to learn

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.760 
cool is that you don't need to learn
loads<00:00:42.270> of<00:00:42.360> them<00:00:42.450> there's<00:00:42.660> only<00:00:42.840> one<00:00:43.110> because

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
loads of them there's only one because

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.369 
loads of them there's only one because
it<00:00:43.890> uses<00:00:44.160> every<00:00:44.700> note<00:00:44.940> on<00:00:45.149> the<00:00:45.300> saxophone<00:00:45.629> so

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
it uses every note on the saxophone so

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:47.720 
it uses every note on the saxophone so
really<00:00:46.739> quickly<00:00:47.070> I'm<00:00:47.219> going<00:00:47.280> to<00:00:47.430> cover<00:00:47.550> the

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
really quickly I'm going to cover the

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.700 
really quickly I'm going to cover the
notes<00:00:47.910> for<00:00:48.270> a<00:00:48.329> chromatic<00:00:48.960> scale<00:00:49.079> starting<00:00:49.559> on

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
notes for a chromatic scale starting on

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.010 
notes for a chromatic scale starting on
the<00:00:49.829> note<00:00:49.950> G<00:00:50.219> and<00:00:50.520> here<00:00:51.360> are<00:00:51.420> the<00:00:51.480> notes<00:00:51.600> so

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.240 
the note G and here are the notes so
start<00:00:52.230> on<00:00:52.350> G<00:00:52.680> it<00:00:53.579> goes<00:00:53.850> to<00:00:54.120> G<00:00:54.329> sharp<00:00:54.800> then<00:00:55.800> to<00:00:56.219> a

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
start on G it goes to G sharp then to a

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.860 
start on G it goes to G sharp then to a
and<00:00:56.760> then<00:00:57.719> up<00:00:57.870> to<00:00:57.899> three<00:00:58.770> flat<00:00:59.100> or<00:00:59.550> a<00:00:59.609> sharp

then to B then to C then to C sharp then
to<00:01:06.450> D<00:01:07.110> with<00:01:07.320> that<00:01:07.439> octave<00:01:07.740> key<00:01:07.890> on<00:01:08.210> D<00:01:09.210> to<00:01:09.390> d

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
to D with that octave key on D to d

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:14.810 
to D with that octave key on D to d
sharp<00:01:10.070> d<00:01:11.070> sharp<00:01:11.100> to<00:01:11.549> e<00:01:11.760> e<00:01:12.060> to<00:01:12.930> F<00:01:13.290> F<00:01:14.010> to<00:01:14.340> F<00:01:14.490> sharp

sharp d sharp to e e to F F to F sharp

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.050 
sharp d sharp to e e to F F to F sharp
and<00:01:15.090> that<00:01:15.509> brings<00:01:15.720> us<00:01:15.840> back<00:01:15.990> to<00:01:16.229> G<00:01:16.920> so<00:01:17.189> you're

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
and that brings us back to G so you're

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.260 
and that brings us back to G so you're
going<00:01:18.210> back<00:01:18.360> down<00:01:18.509> the<00:01:18.630> mg<00:01:19.049> down<00:01:19.680> to<00:01:19.860> F<00:01:19.979> sharp

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:20.270 
going back down the mg down to F sharp

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:26.330 
going back down the mg down to F sharp
down<00:01:21.270> to<00:01:21.450> F<00:01:21.950> down<00:01:22.950> to<00:01:23.130> e<00:01:23.330> down<00:01:24.330> to<00:01:24.509> d<00:01:24.689> sharp<00:01:25.340> down

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
down to F down to e down to d sharp down

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.550 
down to F down to e down to d sharp down
to<00:01:26.549> D<00:01:26.790> then<00:01:27.720> we<00:01:27.780> take<00:01:27.900> all<00:01:28.049> the<00:01:28.170> fingers<00:01:28.439> off

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
to D then we take all the fingers off

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:36.020 
to D then we take all the fingers off
for<00:01:28.740> C<00:01:28.950> sharp<00:01:29.280> down<00:01:30.180> to<00:01:30.329> C<00:01:30.860> B<00:01:32.090> B<00:01:33.090> flat<00:01:33.450> a<00:01:33.890> G<00:01:35.030> sharp

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
for C sharp down to C B B flat a G sharp

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.410 
for C sharp down to C B B flat a G sharp
and<00:01:36.360> G<00:01:37.640> so<00:01:38.640> you<00:01:38.729> can<00:01:38.850> see<00:01:38.970> we're<00:01:39.119> going<00:01:39.240> from

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
and G so you can see we're going from

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.170 
and G so you can see we're going from
one<00:01:39.540> note<00:01:39.750> up<00:01:40.049> a<00:01:40.259> semitone<00:01:40.530> to<00:01:41.009> a<00:01:41.250> half-step<00:01:41.759> up

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
one note up a semitone to a half-step up

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:43.609 
one note up a semitone to a half-step up
another<00:01:42.420> semitone<00:01:42.899> it's<00:01:43.140> always<00:01:43.409> up<00:01:43.530> a

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
another semitone it's always up a

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.499 
another semitone it's always up a
semitone<00:01:43.920> there's<00:01:44.850> different<00:01:45.119> ways<00:01:45.180> to<00:01:45.329> think

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
semitone there's different ways to think
