00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:05.439
 in this video we are going to practice 

00:00:02.950 --> 00:00:08.080
 perfect cadence with preparation from 

00:00:05.439 --> 00:00:10.800
 the fourth grade or sub dominant and what 

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:13.410
 we will do in the key of greater sun 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.019
 we analyze the link between each of 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.660
 the chords 

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:20.150
 to place the accordÃ© of sun we will put 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:25.460
 the fingers in the following order heart 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:27.860
 they are index yes and ring sun but you know 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:30.590
 that our goal will be that before 

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:33.620
 finish this chapter we are able 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:36.460
 to put the chords in low block 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:39.100
 fundamental in sixth string 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:41.469
 to pass the chord do we must place 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:43.650
 again all the fingers since not 

00:00:41.469 --> 00:00:46.170
 we have no notes in common 

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:49.740
 the order until we can put them in 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:53.970
 block will be finger ring finger heart 

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:57.000
 me and index finger low fundamental bass in 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:58.610
 fifth string the sixth string should not 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.310
 touch 

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:04.220
 when we move on to remember seventh we have 

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:07.430
 one finger guides the end of the second string 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:09.530
 is common to both chords so 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:12.770
 we only have to move the fingers 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:15.350
 heart to the side and nullify a fa 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:18.320
 sustained the fundamental bass of re 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:21.229
 seventh is on the fourth string and the 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:23.850
 Fifth and sixth strings should not be touched 

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:26.909
 in this chord 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:29.369
 watch how the thumb moves while 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:33.530
 we keep the existing guiding finger between 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:33.530
 the chords of do and re seventh 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:42.799
 the network change seventh sun has 

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:45.110
 the ring finger as a guiding finger in this 

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:47.450
 occasion moves on the first 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:51.500
 rope going from a sharp F to a 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:53.780
 Sun looks closely at the images and 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:56.509
 You will see that we only have to place the 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:59.229
 fingers heart and index to form the 

00:01:56.509 --> 00:01:59.229
 I remembered the sun 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:06.190
 look closely at the images 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:22.560
 at the time of making the changes 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:25.830
 we should always relax the pressure of 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:28.290
 thumb that will move in each agreed that 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:30.480
 will move on each chord looking for the 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:33.360
 most comfortable and stable position of the 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:37.370
 doll as we saw in the construction 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:37.370
 individual of each of the chords 

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:52.400
 we show you now several patterns for 

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:56.240
 make the change of sun chords 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:58.760
 and re seventh follows the instructions of 

00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:01.330
 the score and count out loud to the 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:01.330
 four times 

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:06.519
 i 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.890
 Y 

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:13.209
 Y 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:16.820
 Y 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:23.620
 i 

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:40.010
 and 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:49.739
 Y 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:53.159
 i 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:00.290
 Y 

00:04:37.139 --> 00:04:39.680
 i 

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:42.410
 here 

00:05:01.969 --> 00:05:04.929
 Y 

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:17.220
 Y 

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:24.349
 when you master these patterns it happens to 

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:26.660
 practice them with the rhythmic bases of 

00:05:24.349 --> 00:05:29.470
 accompaniment that we have sent you in 

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:29.470
 mp3 format 

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:42.760
 i 

00:05:57.740 --> 00:05:59.830
 Y 

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:02.790
 ah 

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:09.840
 practice the four patterns with the 

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:12.980
 accompaniment before moving to 

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:12.980
 intonation exercises
