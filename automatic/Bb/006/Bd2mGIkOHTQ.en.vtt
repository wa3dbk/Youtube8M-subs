00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.080 

first<00:00:00.930> step<00:00:01.230> is<00:00:01.800> to<00:00:01.860> take<00:00:02.159> this<00:00:02.370> guard<00:00:02.700> that<00:00:02.970> we

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:03.090 
first step is to take this guard that we

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:06.380 
first step is to take this guard that we
have<00:00:03.330> which<00:00:04.259> has<00:00:04.410> already<00:00:04.560> been<00:00:04.710> fitted<00:00:05.390> for

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:06.390 
have which has already been fitted for

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:13.669 
have which has already been fitted for
our<00:00:06.480> knives<00:00:10.639> and<00:00:11.639> what<00:00:11.849> we<00:00:12.090> do<00:00:12.360> is<00:00:12.660> we<00:00:13.349> put<00:00:13.559> it

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
our knives and what we do is we put it

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:21.630 
our knives and what we do is we put it
in<00:00:13.769> this<00:00:13.920> block<00:00:14.250> right<00:00:14.280> here

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:21.640 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:27.089 

and<00:00:22.640> then<00:00:22.789> we<00:00:22.910> have<00:00:22.939> to<00:00:23.180> polish<00:00:24.019> this<00:00:24.579> guard<00:00:25.579> up

00:00:27.089 --> 00:00:27.099 
and then we have to polish this guard up

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:29.560 
and then we have to polish this guard up
so<00:00:28.099> we<00:00:28.220> don't<00:00:28.369> have<00:00:28.430> to<00:00:28.579> do<00:00:28.669> that<00:00:28.699> later<00:00:29.090> to

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:29.570 
so we don't have to do that later to

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:47.930 
so we don't have to do that later to
ruin<00:00:29.810> our<00:00:29.899> blade

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:55.650 

Wolof<00:00:53.520> next<00:00:54.520> step<00:00:54.730> is<00:00:55.240> I'm<00:00:55.360> going<00:00:55.450> to<00:00:55.510> take

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:55.660 
Wolof next step is I'm going to take

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:57.900 
Wolof next step is I'm going to take
this<00:00:55.840> pioneer<00:00:56.440> and<00:00:57.280> I'll<00:00:57.400> put<00:00:57.550> it<00:00:57.640> on<00:00:57.730> what's

00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:57.910 
this pioneer and I'll put it on what's

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:00.330 
this pioneer and I'll put it on what's
called<00:00:58.090> a<00:00:58.180> red<00:00:58.360> wheel<00:00:58.600> to<00:00:59.530> make<00:00:59.710> sure<00:00:59.890> all<00:01:00.190> the

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:00.340 
called a red wheel to make sure all the

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:02.460 
called a red wheel to make sure all the
scratches<00:01:01.000> are<00:01:01.360> out<00:01:01.480> of<00:01:01.630> here<00:01:01.810> before<00:01:01.990> we<00:01:02.290> put

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:02.470 
scratches are out of here before we put

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:24.360 
scratches are out of here before we put
that<00:01:02.500> guard<00:01:02.860> on

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:24.370 

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:32.580 

now<00:01:25.370> we<00:01:25.820> put<00:01:26.030> the<00:01:26.150> guard<00:01:26.390> on

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:32.590 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:36.580 

and<00:01:33.590> I<00:01:33.740> use<00:01:33.950> a<00:01:33.980> tool<00:01:34.310> like<00:01:34.580> this<00:01:34.640> which<00:01:35.530> is<00:01:36.530> a

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:36.590 
and I use a tool like this which is a

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:39.010 
and I use a tool like this which is a
pretty<00:01:36.800> big<00:01:37.040> hole<00:01:37.250> so<00:01:37.640> goes<00:01:38.240> over<00:01:38.510> the<00:01:38.600> tang<00:01:38.900> of

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:39.020 
pretty big hole so goes over the tang of

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:50.340 
pretty big hole so goes over the tang of
the<00:01:39.080> knife<00:01:39.290> and<00:01:39.620> pushes<00:01:40.250> that<00:01:40.400> guard<00:01:40.700> down

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:50.350 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:53.340 

just<00:01:51.350> make<00:01:51.560> sure<00:01:51.590> that<00:01:51.860> everything<00:01:52.520> is<00:01:52.550> flush

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:53.350 
just make sure that everything is flush

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:59.290 
just make sure that everything is flush
and<00:01:54.610> that<00:01:55.610> there<00:01:55.790> are<00:01:55.940> no<00:01:56.150> gaps<00:01:58.030> looks<00:01:59.030> good

00:01:59.290 --> 00:01:59.300 
and that there are no gaps looks good

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:01.870 
and that there are no gaps looks good
means<00:01:59.960> you<00:02:00.140> got<00:02:00.290> a<00:02:00.320> welt<00:02:00.740> this<00:02:01.010> stud<00:02:01.370> on<00:02:01.550> here

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:01.880 
means you got a welt this stud on here

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:04.450 
means you got a welt this stud on here

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:04.460 
which I'm not very good at but we go to

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:23.559 
which I'm not very good at but we go to
