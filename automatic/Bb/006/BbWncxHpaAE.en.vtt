00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.990
 how about friends welcome once again 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:05.430
 to the channel and good as you can see them 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:08.309
 I bring an excellent application for 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:11.009
 can configure our device 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:13.289
 like a wireless mouse or keyboard for 

00:00:11.009 --> 00:00:14.580
 our pc so good I what they 

00:00:13.289 --> 00:00:18.049
 I want to show in this video is going to be 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.049
 how I configured it 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:23.200
 to begin with we have to download the 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.330
 program for our pc that is 

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:26.980
 You can download it on this page 

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:28.890
 I will leave them in the description of 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:31.230
 video 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.000
 once they are there where dogma says 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.430
 click on the arrow and there you 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.650
 you can on this little arrow and there you 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.150
 you can download and there you can 

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:42.960
 download the program just give you click 

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:45.079
 in the download it starts so once 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.749
 Discharged 

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:50.570
 it is installed by an installation such as windows 

00:00:47.749 --> 00:00:53.910
 normal windows and well once 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:55.800
 have installed it they will have 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:59.600
 in the program when you open it for the first time 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:03.030
 once he asks us for permission to be able 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:04.650
 connect to the network or to be able to 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.810
 interact with the device and we 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.400
 says but if you do not appear 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:12.060
 they can go to the beginning and there they will write 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:14.420
 you only write will write 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.420
 this 

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:19.310
 they are going to write this and they are going to see that they 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:22.190
 this option will appear to allow a 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:23.720
 application through what it says is going to 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:25.760
 appear this window and here in this 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:27.770
 window let's go to us to look for the 

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:30.440
 application we are going to look for the program 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:32.530
 that we just installed and we see that 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:32.530
 here 

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:37.000
 and some who appear 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:43.510
 to make it work we have 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:47.410
 if it does not work for me 

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:50.140
 seems to work, we have to stop 

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:52.300
 palomeras these options these two 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:53.950
 options as you can see to be able to 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:55.510
 change here as you will see is day where 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:57.630
 he says change the configuration they give me 

00:01:55.510 --> 00:02:02.020
 there to be able to modify these options 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:04.300
 they select them and they accept and 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:07.240
 then we can use the program 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:09.850
 and connect it with this device a 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:11.890
 Once this is done we have already executed the 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:13.260
 program and we see that it appears to us from this 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:16.439
 shape 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:18.030
 to be able to see the ip that we 

00:02:16.439 --> 00:02:19.860
 we have to configure that now we are going to 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:22.140
 see in the application that we are going to 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:26.120
 install the device we have to see 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:28.440
 this ip to be able to put it in our 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:32.860
 device so good now let's 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:36.250
 move on to install the application 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:38.920
 to later see how this works 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:40.420
 program so let's move the mobile 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:42.160
 and good now that we are in the 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:44.800
 device as you can see I already have 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:46.780
 installed the application 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:48.310
 I will also leave the link of the 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:50.560
 video because if they download it directory 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:53.210
 repressor so well let's go now to 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:55.910
 configure the application 

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:58.370
 we open it and when what we need 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:00.350
 it's going to be connected to the same network 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:01.640
 it is not necessary to have connection to 

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:04.340
 internet but if it is necessary to be 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:06.980
 connected to the same network and good for 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:08.570
 add to our team as we already 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:12.550
 we had seen earlier here we go 

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:12.550
 to write a name 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:18.270
 and as we had seen as I said 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:20.670
 in the option here we're going to have to 

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:23.370
 put the ip address that appears 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:26.280
 when we give to 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:28.200
 to the pc program options that 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:30.599
 today we are going to give you the window and we 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:32.790
 ip appears and good that is going to be the ip 

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:36.560
 that we are going to put here 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:36.560
 example in my pc's appears as 

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:45.310
 1 190 and 3.168 16 1 ss once I have already 

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:47.580
 we have put here we give the popcorn 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:50.670
 Y 

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:53.880
 the network is saved and we see that it says here 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:55.290
 pce in network of that name that has here 

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:57.180
 we can put any 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:59.700
 name but once it's saved 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:01.830
 we just select it and it's going to 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:02.880
 connect to the pc if it appears here in 

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:04.920
 the 

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:08.060
 the little popcorn is that it has already been 

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:10.800
 connected to the pc we can already use 

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:12.420
 our device with a mouse or as 

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:14.930
 keyboard 

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:16.919
 now once we have already configured 

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:19.280
 we have no one where it says 

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:21.720
 we select them and we see them here 

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:23.190
 that when we open it, the 

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:26.240
 options how can we use our 

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:28.880
 device and here we have 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:30.259
 and mouse and keyboard that is down here 

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:32.900
 but this option is not recommended 

00:04:30.259 --> 00:04:34.250
 a lot since you can can change the 

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:35.479
 configurations of our keyboard and 

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:37.729
 we would have to restart our 

00:04:35.479 --> 00:04:39.740
 device so that it works so 

00:04:37.729 --> 00:04:41.319
 Well this is the first is that I 

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:44.030
 I recommend that you use what is 

00:04:41.319 --> 00:04:45.500
 to be able to use it as humans and 

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:47.599
 also as a keyboard that here 

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:49.759
 appears disappears in purple 

00:04:47.599 --> 00:04:53.780
 we select the keyboard and we can 

00:04:49.759 --> 00:04:56.570
 be writing in the tpc 

00:04:53.780 --> 00:05:00.639
 and well now let's make a small 

00:04:56.570 --> 00:05:02.379
 test I'm going to use it and I'm going to 

00:05:00.639 --> 00:05:05.360
 and show them how it looks on the tab 

00:05:02.379 --> 00:05:07.099
 so let's see 

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:08.810
 and well here we can see that if it is 

00:05:07.099 --> 00:05:10.099
 working as you can see I'm 

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:12.650
 moving the mouse by means of my 

00:05:10.099 --> 00:05:14.000
 device and well let's use the 

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:16.129
 keyboard so that it orient if 

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.710
 it works we're going here to make a 

00:05:16.129 --> 00:05:20.330
 search let's select and how 

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:22.939
 you can see I'm doing everything for the 

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:24.439
 device we press who is the 

00:05:22.939 --> 00:05:27.789
 keyboard and we see the keyboard that in 

00:05:24.439 --> 00:05:27.789
 the device we are going to write something 

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:33.500
 I wrote badly 

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:42.970
 and we select here we see that we 

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:42.970
 appear 

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:48.510
 we select them 

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:50.600
 and as you can see it is working very 

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:50.600
 all right 

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:58.550
 well my internet is somewhat slow now 

00:05:56.910 --> 00:06:00.860
 but good 

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:03.430
 let's find something else let's look 

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:03.430
 the channel 

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:15.820
 and we go to client 

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:18.330
 and we see that here it appears 

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:21.190
 and as you can see it works excellent 

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:23.200
 it works excellent 

00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:25.570
 this 

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:28.000
 this program for that for our 

00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:29.830
 device and good I think a very 

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.610
 good application as you can see that 

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:34.289
 we can be using 

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:36.930
 I hope you download it 

00:06:34.289 --> 00:06:39.949
 prove that I recommend conforama and 

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:39.949
 it works excellent 

00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:43.180
 here for our 

00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:49.790
 device and we can do everything and 

00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:52.300
 doing all the functions that we have 

00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:52.300
 with the mouse 

00:06:52.449 --> 00:06:56.590
 here directly on the device and 

00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:58.360
 I think it's a very good application 

00:06:56.590 --> 00:06:59.199
 I hope you download it and well this has 

00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:02.020
 been the video that today he wanted 

00:06:59.199 --> 00:07:03.729
 bring them I hope you liked it if 

00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:07.349
 it is like this he commented in shared subscribe 

00:07:03.729 --> 00:07:07.349
 and see you until the next video
