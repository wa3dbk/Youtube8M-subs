00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 
because you save over 10 seconds each

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:18.500 
because you save over 10 seconds each
trip<00:02:16.770> and<00:02:16.980> as<00:02:17.459> you<00:02:17.550> can<00:02:17.700> see<00:02:17.730> it<00:02:17.940> took<00:02:18.090> about<00:02:18.209> 10

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
only use like two or three seconds every

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:26.479 
only use like two or three seconds every
trip<00:02:22.910> simply<00:02:23.959> right-click<00:02:24.959> make<00:02:25.319> X<00:02:25.620> and<00:02:26.250> then

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:28.640 
will take one loader and will fire runic
then<00:03:26.910> you<00:03:27.060> can<00:03:27.209> use<00:03:27.329> an<00:03:27.480> air<00:03:27.690> stuff<00:03:28.019> the<00:03:28.410> house

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:28.650 
then you can use an air stuff the house

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:30.979 
then you can use an air stuff the house
step<00:03:28.950> will<00:03:29.160> take<00:03:29.400> one<00:03:29.579> lauren<00:03:30.000> one<00:03:30.359> area<00:03:30.780> and

00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:30.989 
step will take one lauren one area and

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:33.080 
step will take one lauren one area and
you'll<00:03:31.620> need<00:03:31.799> an<00:03:31.920> earth<00:03:32.160> stuff<00:03:32.430> for<00:03:32.609> that<00:03:32.730> the

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.090 
you'll need an earth stuff for that the

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:35.090 
you'll need an earth stuff for that the
catalog<00:03:33.450> tab<00:03:33.720> will<00:03:33.989> take<00:03:34.260> you<00:03:34.380> one<00:03:34.590> low<00:03:34.829> rune

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:35.100 
catalog tab will take you one low rune

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:37.460 
catalog tab will take you one low rune
and<00:03:35.220> usually<00:03:35.940> it<00:03:36.060> takes<00:03:36.090> five<00:03:36.450> Ares<00:03:36.989> so<00:03:37.260> that's

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:37.470 
and usually it takes five Ares so that's

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:39.800 
and usually it takes five Ares so that's
why<00:03:37.620> need<00:03:37.829> and<00:03:38.130> stuff<00:03:38.430> and<00:03:38.730> that<00:03:39.390> way<00:03:39.540> it<00:03:39.660> will

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:39.810 
why need and stuff and that way it will

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:41.750 
why need and stuff and that way it will
only<00:03:39.959> take<00:03:40.109> one<00:03:40.470> lower<00:03:40.680> and<00:03:41.010> the<00:03:41.400> watchtower

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:41.760 
only take one lower and the watchtower

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:44.420 
only take one lower and the watchtower
tab<00:03:42.090> will<00:03:42.359> cost<00:03:42.600> to<00:03:42.840> laurens<00:03:43.319> and<00:03:43.620> you<00:03:43.920> use<00:03:44.250> an

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:44.430 
tab will cost to laurens and you use an

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:46.940 
tab will cost to laurens and you use an
earth<00:03:44.609> stuff<00:03:44.940> and<00:03:45.209> the<00:03:45.359> RT<00:03:45.690> tab<00:03:45.930> will<00:03:46.170> cost<00:03:46.500> to

have to this guide so i just estimated

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:17.569 
have to this guide so i just estimated
that<00:04:15.690> mid<00:04:15.959> price<00:04:16.229> and<00:04:17.160> we're<00:04:17.310> just<00:04:17.430> keeping

00:04:17.569 --> 00:04:17.579 
that mid price and we're just keeping

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:19.969 
that mid price and we're just keeping
two<00:04:17.850> minutes<00:04:18.150> ahead<00:04:18.299> because<00:04:18.570> it's<00:04:18.930> not<00:04:19.139> kind

00:04:19.969 --> 00:04:19.979 
two minutes ahead because it's not kind

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:23.010 
the soft clay will rise you'll make even

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:25.430 
the soft clay will rise you'll make even
more<00:05:23.040> profit<00:05:23.670> so<00:05:24.270> for<00:05:24.540> this<00:05:24.600> example<00:05:24.750> we're

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:25.440 
more profit so for this example we're

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:29.240 
more profit so for this example we're
buying<00:05:25.680> 1k<00:05:26.160> clave<00:05:26.520> and<00:05:26.880> you<00:05:27.630> need<00:05:27.810> 37<00:05:28.680> astral

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:29.250 
buying 1k clave and you need 37 astral

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:32.240 
buying 1k clave and you need 37 astral
rooms<00:05:29.490> per<00:05:29.820> 1k<00:05:30.270> clay<00:05:30.600> so<00:05:30.960> that's<00:05:31.590> a<00:05:31.770> total<00:05:31.920> cost

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:32.250 
rooms per 1k clay so that's a total cost

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:35.210

of<00:05:32.460> 34<00:05:33.060> k<00:05:33.270> and<00:05:33.510> by<00:05:34.020> the<00:05:34.080> way<00:05:34.290> I<00:05:34.320> also<00:05:34.800> recommend

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:35.220 
of 34 k and by the way I also recommend

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:37.790

using a steam staff so you should have

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:39.380 
using a steam staff so you should have

your steam staff equipped and your
infant<00:05:39.780> should<00:05:39.960> be<00:05:40.110> 27<00:05:40.890> clay<00:05:41.130> and<00:05:41.400> a<00:05:41.760> few<00:05:42.000> astro

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:42.450 
infant should be 27 clay and a few astro

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:47.390 
infant should be 27 clay and a few astro
rooms<00:05:42.690> and<00:05:43.250> here<00:05:44.250> the<00:05:44.580> total<00:05:45.420> cost<00:05:45.660> is<00:05:45.980> 919<00:05:46.980> GP

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:47.400
