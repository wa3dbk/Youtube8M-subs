00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
just look at some conversions we're

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:28.960 
just look at some conversions we're
going<00:00:28.110> to<00:00:28.170> do<00:00:28.290> the<00:00:28.410> same<00:00:28.440> thing

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:28.970 
going to do the same thing

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:30.680 
going to do the same thing
biomechanically<00:00:29.970> that<00:00:30.120> we<00:00:30.210> did<00:00:30.360> you<00:00:30.480> force

you<00:00:32.700> know<00:00:32.820> the<00:00:33.360> first<00:00:33.570> thing<00:00:33.629> I<00:00:33.780> want<00:00:33.899> to<00:00:34.020> do<00:00:34.140> is

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
you know the first thing I want to do is

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:35.630 
you know the first thing I want to do is
maybe<00:00:34.500> I'm<00:00:34.680> not<00:00:34.829> going<00:00:34.980> to<00:00:35.040> even<00:00:35.129> come<00:00:35.370> from<00:00:35.489> a

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
maybe I'm not going to even come from a

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:36.919 
maybe I'm not going to even come from a
stands<00:00:35.879> but<00:00:36.030> I'm<00:00:36.149> going<00:00:36.300> to<00:00:36.360> come<00:00:36.510> from<00:00:36.660> here

00:00:36.919 --> 00:00:36.929 
stands but I'm going to come from here

00:00:36.929 --> 00:00:39.470 
stands but I'm going to come from here
all<00:00:37.140> right<00:00:37.320> what<00:00:38.039> I<00:00:38.070> want<00:00:38.370> to<00:00:38.489> do<00:00:38.609> is<00:00:38.640> look<00:00:39.239> at

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
all right what I want to do is look at

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.200 
all right what I want to do is look at
the<00:00:40.429> possibilities<00:00:41.429> when<00:00:41.640> you're<00:00:41.789> going<00:00:42.059> with

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
the possibilities when you're going with

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.079 
the possibilities when you're going with
an<00:00:42.329> open<00:00:42.690> hand<00:00:42.899> all<00:00:43.649> right<00:00:43.829> I<00:00:44.010> like<00:00:44.399> going<00:00:44.879> with

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:45.089 
an open hand all right I like going with

00:00:45.089 --> 00:00:47.660 
an open hand all right I like going with
an<00:00:45.210> open<00:00:45.510> hand<00:00:45.659> first<00:00:45.989> the<00:00:46.589> reason<00:00:46.949> why<00:00:47.129> if<00:00:47.519> I

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
an open hand first the reason why if I

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.279 
an open hand first the reason why if I
was<00:00:47.789> using<00:00:47.969> a<00:00:48.210> cover<00:00:48.449> jamming<00:00:48.839> school<00:00:49.019> sport

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
was using a cover jamming school sport

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.860 
was using a cover jamming school sport
for<00:00:49.409> a<00:00:49.440> second<00:00:49.710> a<00:00:49.739> cover<00:00:49.980> jab<00:00:50.280> right<00:00:50.909> so<00:00:51.179> that's

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
for a second a cover jab right so that's

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.540 
for a second a cover jab right so that's
going<00:00:52.019> to<00:00:52.079> block<00:00:52.289> his<00:00:52.499> line<00:00:52.710> of<00:00:52.890> vision<00:00:53.039> then

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
going to block his line of vision then

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.180 
going to block his line of vision then
maybe<00:00:53.760> my<00:00:53.940> next<00:00:53.999> shot<00:00:54.329> he<00:00:54.480> doesn't<00:00:54.809> see<00:00:55.039> we<00:00:56.039> can

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
maybe my next shot he doesn't see we can

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.099 
maybe my next shot he doesn't see we can
use<00:00:56.339> that<00:00:56.370> same<00:00:56.760> principle<00:00:56.819> with<00:00:57.780> a<00:00:57.809> palm

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
use that same principle with a palm

00:00:58.109 --> 00:00:59.660 
use that same principle with a palm
you'll<00:00:58.319> now<00:00:58.440> see<00:00:58.649> I<00:00:58.769> started<00:00:59.190> to<00:00:59.280> pull<00:00:59.489> back

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
you'll now see I started to pull back

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.790 
you'll now see I started to pull back
there<00:00:59.999> you<00:01:00.300> know<00:01:00.420> maybe<00:01:01.140> that's<00:01:01.499> what<00:01:01.649> we're

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
there you know maybe that's what we're

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.529 
there you know maybe that's what we're
going<00:01:01.979> for<00:01:02.129> or<00:01:02.760> maybe<00:01:02.969> I'm<00:01:03.149> just<00:01:03.179> trying<00:01:03.479> to

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
going for or maybe I'm just trying to

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.840 
going for or maybe I'm just trying to
throw<00:01:03.690> a<00:01:03.749> quick<00:01:03.960> shot<00:01:04.170> and<00:01:04.350> back<00:01:04.500> out<00:01:04.739> okay<00:01:05.190> but

throw a quick shot and back out okay but
the<00:01:06.000> conversion<00:01:06.479> is<00:01:06.510> going<00:01:06.780> to<00:01:06.840> be<00:01:06.990> like<00:01:07.140> this

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:07.440 
the conversion is going to be like this

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:11.630 
the conversion is going to be like this
once<00:01:08.220> i<00:01:08.430> get<00:01:08.670> on<00:01:08.880> here<00:01:09.750> I<00:01:10.049> now<00:01:10.920> have<00:01:11.100> secondary

once i get on here I now have secondary
option<00:01:11.939> scam<00:01:12.450> got<00:01:12.659> race<00:01:12.899> and<00:01:13.259> then<00:01:13.409> from<00:01:13.590> there

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
option scam got race and then from there

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.639 
option scam got race and then from there
I<00:01:14.130> can<00:01:14.159> go<00:01:14.520> into<00:01:14.670> palm<00:01:14.939> heels<00:01:15.270> I<00:01:15.619> gouges<00:01:16.619> and

00:01:16.639 --> 00:01:16.649 
I can go into palm heels I gouges and

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:18.830 
I can go into palm heels I gouges and
that<00:01:16.920> kind<00:01:17.130> of<00:01:17.189> stuff<00:01:17.250> so<00:01:18.000> you're<00:01:18.210> to<00:01:18.420> you<00:01:18.600> now
