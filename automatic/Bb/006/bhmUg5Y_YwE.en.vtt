00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:05.549
 hey people welcome to one 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:10.099
 video very special kind and that the 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:10.099
 top five toys from february 

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:19.140
 Let's start with the 5 of these pictures 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.840
 we get really lust on the 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:24.600
 we'll give you that knee z out of the art 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.160
 removed from silver presented with 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.769
 We can set this game with one 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.279
 Much fun from our own ice kneading 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:31.619
 do 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:33.570
 We especially liked that we the 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.090
 can also mix a new one 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.040
 to create color 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:48.590
 this looks really delicious, or 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:48.590
 we do not come to the 4 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:54.629
 The rate of sand was a real one though 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.829
 cool alternative to the kneading we 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.320
 to have met 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:00.359
 deceptively affects our concocts 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:03.030
 which we train quite cool form 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:05.040
 The sand rate can also dry 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.570
 not from that means also after weeks 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.720
 you can still have fun with it 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:14.250
 like here with our tv tower 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:18.500
 that looks really cool from the kinetics 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.500
 Sand the magic sand for the home and 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:23.540
 now the 3 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:30.160
 May I introduce playmobil number 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.650
 5555 what is that? 

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:34.270
 this is the sweetness of plans 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:36.460
 from the summer fun series 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:38.770
 we not only have shape size or 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:41.920
 candy from kneading with us too 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:45.720
 playmobil offers sweet 2 but beware 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:45.720
 not suitable for consuming 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:02:00.070
 it still looks so delicious when 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:02:02.259
 we come to 2 of the mood and of 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:05.950
 schejbal another cool alternative 

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:09.910
 to knead what we find really cool that 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:11.860
 is simply the red color of the user and 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:14.350
 also our number 2 is distinguished 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:17.110
 by the fact that he never dries out so 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:22.570
 weeks of fun for months 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:26.580
 guaranteed the muses of shape bodenborn 

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:26.580

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:35.280
