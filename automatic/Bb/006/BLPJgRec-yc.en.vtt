00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
movie it felt as though perhaps we had

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:21.679 
movie it felt as though perhaps we had
too<00:00:20.369> rich<00:00:20.670> a<00:00:20.880> mixture<00:00:21.240> for<00:00:21.539> this

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
too rich a mixture for this

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:24.740 
too rich a mixture for this
feather-light<00:00:22.260> tale<00:00:22.789> sometimes<00:00:23.789> less<00:00:24.480> is

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
feather-light tale sometimes less is

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.029 
feather-light tale sometimes less is
more<00:00:25.400> but<00:00:26.400> what<00:00:26.640> you're<00:00:26.820> about<00:00:26.970> to<00:00:27.119> see<00:00:27.300> now<00:00:27.510> is

more but what you're about to see now is

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:30.589 
more but what you're about to see now is
firstly<00:00:29.039> an<00:00:29.220> alternative<00:00:29.939> opening<00:00:30.390> to<00:00:30.510> the

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
firstly an alternative opening to the

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.110 
firstly an alternative opening to the
movie<00:00:30.900> and<00:00:31.080> this<00:00:31.740> was<00:00:31.980> an<00:00:32.130> experiment<00:00:32.700> we

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
movie and this was an experiment we

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.120 
movie and this was an experiment we
wanted<00:00:33.450> to<00:00:33.540> see<00:00:33.750> if<00:00:33.989> seeing<00:00:34.410> more<00:00:34.710> of<00:00:34.920> young

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
wanted to see if seeing more of young

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.069 
wanted to see if seeing more of young
Ella<00:00:35.430> in<00:00:35.700> the<00:00:35.820> early<00:00:36.180> stages<00:00:36.450> of<00:00:36.690> her<00:00:36.809> life

Ella in the early stages of her life

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.410 
Ella in the early stages of her life
would<00:00:37.649> perhaps<00:00:37.829> have<00:00:38.040> us<00:00:38.250> invest<00:00:38.700> more<00:00:38.940> in<00:00:39.210> her

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
would perhaps have us invest more in her

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.900 
would perhaps have us invest more in her
life<00:00:39.450> and<00:00:39.930> her<00:00:40.050> family<00:00:40.440> relationships<00:00:41.010> and<00:00:41.579> we

life and her family relationships and we

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.430 
life and her family relationships and we
also<00:00:42.059> wanted<00:00:42.450> to<00:00:42.480> experiment<00:00:42.870> with<00:00:43.230> how<00:00:43.260> we

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
also wanted to experiment with how we

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.670 
also wanted to experiment with how we
might<00:00:43.739> introduce<00:00:44.340> our<00:00:44.579> mice<00:00:44.969> family<00:00:45.750> in<00:00:46.500> the

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
might introduce our mice family in the

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.590 
might introduce our mice family in the
end<00:00:46.860> the<00:00:47.399> shorthand<00:00:47.910> that<00:00:48.000> we<00:00:48.180> used<00:00:48.360> in<00:00:48.510> the

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
end the shorthand that we used in the

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.540 
end the shorthand that we used in the
finished<00:00:48.930> movie<00:00:49.140> allowed<00:00:49.770> us<00:00:49.950> to<00:00:49.980> establish

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
finished movie allowed us to establish
