00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:19.110
 the goal in this year after these 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:21.840
 last two participations that we have 

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:25.050
 the top ten with a ninth 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:27.439
 and a seventh and to be first in the 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:30.509
 class of series derivative trucks 

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:32.340
 well oysters we are very excited about 

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:34.559
 this truck really is a truck 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.320
 to do the first five but yes 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:39.000
 which is a very complicated race is a 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:42.330
 very long career where many 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.149
 things and where our trick most 

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:48.680
 important is trying to get this 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.680
 rhythm of not breaking things 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.870
 in February we had one found 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:59.370
 call of gerard de rooy proposing us 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:01.210
 throwing forward the project this 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.070
 team 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:06.710
 to try to make things difficult 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:08.810
 to those who love the Russians especially 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:11.780
 and well and we are proud that there 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:14.299
 told us and it's a challenge to 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:17.420
 same time because we really go with 

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:19.100
 a frontline truck then well 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:21.670
 this is an opportunity that we could not 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:21.670
 let go 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:41.730
 if in September the team opens to 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:43.200
 the race if the wake is in in the 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:45.660
 departures in St. Petersburg and the 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:48.420
 arrivals in shock in the Black Sea 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:52.410
 they are about 4000 kilometers of race and 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:54.330
 about 2500 special and comes and will be the 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:57.420
 start-up of this team and see 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:59.550
 where we are and to shoot not if I think 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:01.410
 which can be very interesting as 

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:06.120
 start up having this 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:08.910
 experience then in December because nothing 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:11.340
 we will go towards Argentina for the 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:15.120
 dakar 2011 how good that this is the 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:17.700
 career and everything is focused on this 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:20.250
 dakar to see how we face the 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:22.700

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:22.700
