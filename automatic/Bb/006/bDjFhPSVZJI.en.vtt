00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
about events like this is that you get

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.389 
about events like this is that you get
to<00:01:57.540> see<00:01:57.750> so<00:01:58.049> many<00:01:58.200> different<00:01:58.350> people<00:01:58.740> in<00:01:59.189> all

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
to see so many different people in all

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:00.770 
to see so many different people in all
of<00:01:59.430> their<00:01:59.759> different<00:02:00.240> fashions<00:02:00.659> because

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
of their different fashions because

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.649 
of their different fashions because
everyone<00:02:01.439> has<00:02:01.680> their<00:02:02.040> own<00:02:02.149> style<00:02:03.149> and<00:02:03.509> I<00:02:03.630> think

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
everyone has their own style and I think

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.810 
everyone has their own style and I think
that<00:02:03.930> is<00:02:04.079> so<00:02:04.259> important<00:02:04.860> even<00:02:05.009> though<00:02:05.490> we<00:02:05.640> live

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
that is so important even though we live

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.580 
that is so important even though we live
in<00:02:05.850> a<00:02:06.030> society<00:02:06.360> where<00:02:06.719> everyone<00:02:07.020> is<00:02:07.170> trying<00:02:07.469> to

in a society where everyone is trying to

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.260 
in a society where everyone is trying to
be<00:02:07.799> like<00:02:08.009> someone<00:02:08.250> else<00:02:08.550> sometimes<00:02:08.789> and

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
be like someone else sometimes and

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.240 
be like someone else sometimes and
that's<00:02:09.599> what's<00:02:09.959> popular<00:02:10.200> the<00:02:10.770> thing<00:02:10.950> I<00:02:11.039> love

you recently changed from urban your mat

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:31.470 
you recently changed from urban your mat
to<00:02:28.960> the<00:02:28.990> top<00:02:29.380> four<00:02:29.740> yes<00:02:30.280> this<00:02:30.580> is<00:02:30.700> a<00:02:31.000> very<00:02:31.030> big

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.480 
to the top four yes this is a very big

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:32.790 
to the top four yes this is a very big
deal<00:02:31.630> I<00:02:31.810> used<00:02:31.930> to<00:02:31.990> work<00:02:32.140> in<00:02:32.230> radio<00:02:32.320> so<00:02:32.770> I

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:32.800 
deal I used to work in radio so I

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:35.520 
deal I used to work in radio so I
totally<00:02:33.400> understand<00:02:33.850> sometimes<00:02:34.180> we<00:02:34.870> can<00:02:35.170> get

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530 
totally understand sometimes we can get

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:38.250 
totally understand sometimes we can get
stuck<00:02:36.010> in<00:02:36.040> a<00:02:36.220> bubble<00:02:36.400> and<00:02:36.820> I<00:02:37.630> think<00:02:37.960> just

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260 
stuck in a bubble and I think just

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.690 
stuck in a bubble and I think just
because<00:02:39.090> you<00:02:40.090> were<00:02:40.300> raised<00:02:40.600> in<00:02:40.959> a<00:02:41.080> particular

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
because you were raised in a particular

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:44.190 
because you were raised in a particular
secular<00:02:42.700> of<00:02:42.940> music<00:02:43.360> does<00:02:43.570> not<00:02:43.720> mean<00:02:43.959> that<00:02:43.990> you

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:44.200 
secular of music does not mean that you

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:45.960 
secular of music does not mean that you
can't<00:02:44.470> branch<00:02:44.740> out<00:02:44.950> and<00:02:45.100> do<00:02:45.190> other<00:02:45.310> things<00:02:45.430> and

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:45.970 
can't branch out and do other things and

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:48.240 
can't branch out and do other things and
I<00:02:46.270> also<00:02:46.480> believe<00:02:46.959> that<00:02:46.990> music<00:02:47.380> now<00:02:47.860> is

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.250 
I also believe that music now is

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:50.580 
I also believe that music now is
becoming<00:02:48.670> more<00:02:49.030> of<00:02:49.330> a<00:02:49.480> lifestyle<00:02:50.020> and<00:02:50.350> less

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:50.590 
becoming more of a lifestyle and less

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:52.680 
becoming more of a lifestyle and less
about<00:02:50.890> what<00:02:51.489> color<00:02:51.700> you<00:02:51.940> are<00:02:51.970> what<00:02:52.150> kind<00:02:52.540> of

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:52.690 
about what color you are what kind of

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:54.690 
about what color you are what kind of
music<00:02:53.080> you<00:02:53.110> like<00:02:53.230> and<00:02:53.680> it's<00:02:54.010> really<00:02:54.340> becoming

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:54.700 
music you like and it's really becoming

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:58.050 
music you like and it's really becoming
a<00:02:55.000> lifestyle<00:02:55.540> so<00:02:55.660> I<00:02:55.840> think<00:02:56.850> eventually<00:02:57.850> there

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:58.060 
a lifestyle so I think eventually there

00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:59.880 
a lifestyle so I think eventually there
will<00:02:58.180> come<00:02:58.390> a<00:02:58.450> time<00:02:58.540> when<00:02:59.050> music<00:02:59.440> will<00:02:59.620> be<00:02:59.739> all

00:02:59.880 --> 00:02:59.890 
will come a time when music will be all

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:01.740 
will come a time when music will be all
things<00:03:00.160> to<00:03:00.310> all<00:03:00.340> people<00:03:00.459> so<00:03:01.300> for<00:03:01.510> me
