under the hood of the car I took the

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:48.299 
under the hood of the car I took the
original<00:00:45.370> gas<00:00:45.969> tank<00:00:46.350> gutted<00:00:47.350> it<00:00:47.469> put<00:00:47.949> a<00:00:47.979> fuel

00:00:48.299 --> 00:00:48.309 
original gas tank gutted it put a fuel

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:50.160

safe<00:00:48.549> fuel<00:00:48.819> cell<00:00:49.089> in<00:00:49.239> it<00:00:49.329> and<00:00:49.449> then<00:00:49.780> put<00:00:49.929> a<00:00:49.960> gas

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:50.170 
safe fuel cell in it and then put a gas

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:51.750 
safe fuel cell in it and then put a gas
filler<00:00:50.469> through<00:00:50.739> the<00:00:50.799> hood<00:00:50.979> now<00:00:51.429> I<00:00:51.460> put<00:00:51.670> the

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:51.760 
filler through the hood now I put the

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:54.090 
filler through the hood now I put the
fuel<00:00:51.999> filler<00:00:52.510> over<00:00:52.749> to<00:00:53.289> one<00:00:53.469> side<00:00:53.739> to<00:00:53.920> make<00:00:53.949> it

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:54.100 
fuel filler over to one side to make it

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:57.539 
fuel filler over to one side to make it
a<00:00:54.249> little<00:00:54.370> easier<00:00:54.519> to<00:00:54.850> fuel<00:00:55.299> it<00:00:55.449> up<00:00:56.339> up<00:00:57.339> in<00:00:57.459> the

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:57.549 
a little easier to fuel it up up in the

00:00:57.549 --> 00:00:59.160 
a little easier to fuel it up up in the
front<00:00:57.789> we've<00:00:57.940> got<00:00:57.969> a<00:00:58.329> front-mounted<00:00:58.780> oil

00:00:59.160 --> 00:00:59.170 
front we've got a front-mounted oil

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:01.559 
front we've got a front-mounted oil
cooler<00:00:59.469> and<00:00:59.679> we<00:01:00.339> have<00:01:00.549> brake<00:01:01.089> ducts<00:01:01.420> to

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:01.569 
cooler and we have brake ducts to

00:01:01.569 --> 00:01:04.259 
cooler and we have brake ducts to
cool-cool<00:01:02.350> the<00:01:02.499> brakes<00:01:02.739> now<00:01:03.280> this<00:01:03.459> car<00:01:03.760> is<00:01:03.969> a

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:04.269 
cool-cool the brakes now this car is a

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:06.240 
cool-cool the brakes now this car is a
1962<00:01:05.229> so<00:01:05.379> it<00:01:05.470> would<00:01:05.560> have<00:01:05.650> originally<00:01:05.860> had

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:06.250 
1962 so it would have originally had

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:08.070 
1962 so it would have originally had
drum<00:01:06.549> brakes<00:01:06.820> but<00:01:07.000> we<00:01:07.120> built<00:01:07.420> it<00:01:07.630> to<00:01:07.780> run<00:01:07.960> in

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:08.080 
drum brakes but we built it to run in

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:10.950 
drum brakes but we built it to run in
the<00:01:08.170> disc<00:01:08.380> brake<00:01:08.530> class<00:01:09.000> it<00:01:10.000> has<00:01:10.180> disc<00:01:10.540> brakes

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:24.220 
nice simple gauge package in it so you

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:26.550

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.040 
also takes less drag on the engine so

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:31.620
