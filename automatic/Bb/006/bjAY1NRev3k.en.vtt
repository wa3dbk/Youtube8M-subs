00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780
 hello my name is Valery and today 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:06.060
 we have unpacking such a package 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:09.090
 here is a copy of the headphones under 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:12.300
 name earpods means these headphones i 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:14.639
 ordered for 5 bucks is about 160 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.719
 rubles and this package reached me for 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:18.359
 fifty two days 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:20.490
 Headphones ordered on the site aliexpress 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:22.859
 I will leave a reference in the video description 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:25.340
 so well, in general, here is such and such 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:27.510
 bag I'm surprised by the thickness 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:30.449
 because there is a box still 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:34.340
 I think plastic will be more 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:37.969
 bag okay if I smeared 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:42.950
 an address so that you do not sleep where and live 

00:00:37.969 --> 00:00:53.879
 water let us open the headphones now 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:55.640
 open the package so well here 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:59.910
 They look 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:04.110
 yes such a box is nothing like that 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:06.950
 business card as I understand it yes yes business card cool 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:09.330
 Cruise the first time I try business card 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:12.420
 so here are the headphones themselves 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:17.280
 boxes as i said mean 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:19.290
 original headphones from this they are in 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:22.380
 the box is the same as this apple 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:25.770
 It painted a bull's-eye here and there is no more like 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:30.360
 you can already assure notice these like 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:33.630
 say black stripes on the original 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:35.540
 Headphones that there's nothing here charge 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.540
 give now we will open the headphones 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:38.540

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:53.210

00:01:53.210 --> 00:02:05.200

00:01:53.619 --> 00:02:11.420

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:14.739

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:18.140

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:20.750
 inaccuracy alloy here these black 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:22.850
 stripes but that's it okay fig 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:27.380
 same just cheap copies which cost 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:28.970
 160 rubles can already forgive well in general 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:33.800
 then they look very, very 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:36.950
 even okay so now let's them 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:43.030

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:50.019
 something is set well clear 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:54.579
 no, it's not like that now I'll show them 

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:57.829
 that's what it is but to 

00:02:54.579 --> 00:03:00.530
 adjust the length of the headphones there is such 

00:02:57.829 --> 00:03:02.209
 rubber thing 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:04.970
 I can say so now we are 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:07.700
 listen to these headphones i will tell you what 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:09.560
 there bass how sensitive music and so 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:12.260
 further and also we will compare some more 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:14.510
 headphones and so i can say on 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:17.989
 Through these headphones, I listened to them for a long time. 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:20.540
 listened a long time and I can say 

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:23.150
 only one sound in them is not the worst 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:25.190
 Even there is a database of bases of course not 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:27.769
 powerful but still present but 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:30.380
 the clarity of the music here is generally excellent 

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:33.519
 here we also have a regulator 

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:35.720
 volume plus or minus and microphone 

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:38.660
 volume control for some reason not 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:44.269
 works but the stop button is in the middle 

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:46.340
 the button is it works here it is 

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:50.790
 the volume control is working unfortunately 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:53.680
 don't work right now you hear music 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:55.540
 that is, the volume in these headphones then 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:58.180
 there is normally already they are loud headphones 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:04:00.520
