00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 
drive now is fully enclosed so there is

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:07.270 
drive now is fully enclosed so there is

and keeps it from flexing and snapping
like<00:03:22.920> we<00:03:23.100> said<00:03:23.310> the<00:03:23.459> chain<00:03:23.700> is<00:03:23.970> enclosed<00:03:24.739> on

00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:25.739 
like we said the chain is enclosed on

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:28.880 
like we said the chain is enclosed on
