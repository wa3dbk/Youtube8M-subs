00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:05.430
 hello today we want to present you a new 

00:00:02.679 --> 00:00:08.410
 tool called jean with chrome that 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:10.690
 it works through the chrome browser and 

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:13.509
 so it belongs to google and it ends 

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:15.940
 to be launched because recently this 

00:00:13.509 --> 00:00:17.590
 tool is a web tool for 

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:19.330
 therefore you do not have to install anything in 

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:21.520
 your browser but simply 

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:24.190
 you access this page jan with chrome 

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:25.960
 dotcom and from there you can use it 

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:27.760
 and what is it good for? 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:29.650
 interpret music collaboratively 

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:31.210
 as we will see there is a series of 

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:35.140
 musical instruments that can be 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:36.910
 select and we can touch them online and 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:38.650
 we also do not have to do it alone 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:40.720
 but we can invite our 

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:42.160
 session up to a maximum number of 

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:43.810
 three friends 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:45.970
 we enter then where it says enter 

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:48.880
 You will see that it is in English, but it is 

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:52.680
 It has a very very intuitive use and is very 

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:55.050
 easy to make it work without knowing English 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.690
 once we are inside you see that already 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:02.239
 the first instrument sounds we are going to 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:04.739
 to lower our voice we have guitars batteries 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:07.229
 basically and low synthesizers 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.940
 also that we can select in these 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.280
 controls 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:14.869
 then we would choose an instrument for 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.869
 example I will choose this guitar 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:29.080
 I enter a name for my session 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:29.080
 and I go in 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.539
 and once I'm inside 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:41.520
 as you will see as soon as loading appears 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:44.429
 my guitar here a series of controls 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:46.950
 in the bottom part I see what is my 

00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:48.780
 user at this time I chose as 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.929
 name the echo and the instrument that I 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:54.000
 I touch I can invite friends up to three 

00:01:51.929 --> 00:01:55.860
 to play in the same session as 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.170
 I would then be everything to put on 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:00.600
 agreement about what we are going to do and 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:03.030
 take it out so you can see how 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:05.310
 it could be a collaborative session here 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:08.039
 in a youtube video previously 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:10.760
 uploaded by a user we see what 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:13.710
 it would be a group session 

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:17.330
 we see the instrument that is playing in 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:17.330
 every moment if there are several users 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:23.670
 the person who created this session 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:26.520
 synthesizer and the other people have 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:29.310
 these are the instruments we come back to 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:31.770
 our session and I can touch 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:33.990
 directly 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:37.900
 dragging the mouse 

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:39.939
 and holding the left button 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:43.890
 You see here I have a scale of 

00:02:39.939 --> 00:02:43.890
 chords I can change the scale 

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:52.570
 and put it being for example in two 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:52.570
 then I could start as is 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:59.060
 and keep changing of accord 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:01.160
 each one as more 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:04.280
 I can activate the help to give me 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:06.980
 tips on the progress are in English 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:08.300
 but they are brief tips that even 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:10.459
 you can translate with the translator of 

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:13.510
 google if you do not understand them well here 

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:13.510
 we control the tempo 

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:20.180
 and here we can activate a metronome 

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:23.420
 if it helps us we have two modes 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:25.130
 to touch one is the professional pro 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:28.100
 which in this case is the one that is activated 

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:30.260
 and you just leave us alone alone 

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:35.840
 before the danger with the instrument in 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:38.480
 change in easy mode as they give us the 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:41.600
 guidelines for playing the notes each of 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:43.670
 the notes and beige that have either 

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:48.010
 numbers or letters that means 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:48.010
 that we can activate the ones from him 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:53.990
 from the mouse or else we can 

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:56.720
 enter through the keys those 

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:59.350
 letters or those numbers for example I'm 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:02.870
 now pressing the letter the number three 

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:05.300
 the letter b then thinking about you 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:07.010
 students who are so skilled normally 

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:09.290
 in working with in playing with the 

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:11.450
 consoles and use the keyboard of a 

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:14.210
 absolutely juggler's way 

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:16.160
 It can be a lot easier for them to play 

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:19.310
 with this with this application through 

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:23.090
 of the keyboard I have some minimal controls 

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:25.070
 in each of the instruments and this 

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:27.110
 would be in principle everything here I can 

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:30.430
 change the instrument and I go by 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:30.430
 example to a synthesizer 

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:38.320
 it takes a few seconds to appear but 

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:41.530
 we have it here then at this moment 

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:44.020
 I am in two and I have two sun fa 

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:46.600
 think for example an example that would be 

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:48.790
 very easy imagine the song stand by 

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:50.290
 me that is known by many people to what 

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:51.850
 better among your students is no longer 

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:54.250
 so much because it's an old song but 

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:56.830
 I know that you will understand me if 

00:04:54.250 --> 00:05:00.020
 I select auto play mode which is something 

00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:03.860
 that had not yet been commented 

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:06.680
 will play the instrument only within 

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:09.259
 the note that you give as a guide within 

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:11.210
 the scale that I am using then 

00:05:09.259 --> 00:05:13.639
 if for example I tell you to start do 

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:18.689
 you see that I have different patterns for 

00:05:13.639 --> 00:05:22.379
 give for autoplay 1s that other would be this one 

00:05:18.689 --> 00:05:24.259
 another would be this other would be this I have 

00:05:22.379 --> 00:05:27.599
 the same in all instruments 

00:05:24.259 --> 00:05:31.369
 then imagine that I choose this and 

00:05:27.599 --> 00:05:31.369
 that it lowered a little here the tempo 

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:35.960
 Oh 

00:05:37.759 --> 00:05:42.929
 let's imagine that I want a group of 

00:05:41.369 --> 00:05:44.789
 students of four students with four 

00:05:42.929 --> 00:05:46.919
 different instruments touch the 

00:05:44.789 --> 00:05:48.659
 chords follow the melody and play the 

00:05:46.919 --> 00:05:51.359
 chords of the song stand by me that you 

00:05:48.659 --> 00:05:53.599
 I said before then we would start at all 

00:05:51.359 --> 00:05:53.599
 for example 

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:57.930
 we would change to the lower 

00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:00.880
 fa 

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:05.840
 Sun 

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:05.840
 you 

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:11.270
 the least 

00:06:08.729 --> 00:06:11.270
 fa 

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:16.760
 and sun all this can be done 

00:06:14.419 --> 00:06:21.740
 rhythmically 

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:25.850
 and they can get the melody now stopped the 

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:27.860
 auto play and they can get the same 

00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:30.080
 song at the same pace in the same 

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:32.360
 session and using instruments 

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:33.560
 different as I said to a maximum 

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:34.940
 of 4 people 

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:38.420
 if we invite you through here 

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:40.160
 sharing a link or even 

00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:41.390
 sharing through social networks 

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:44.720
 like twitter 

00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:46.840
 google + and facebook the possibilities are 

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:49.100
 very large is not an instrument 

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:51.320
 professional nor much less is 

00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:53.510
 posed as a game to experience 

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:56.540
 with the rhythms with the melodies with the 

00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:59.360
 different timbres and sounds of each 

00:06:56.540 --> 00:07:01.760
 instrument and think that it can be very 

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:03.650
 interesting inside a classroom where no 

00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:05.390
 there are instruments but you have 

00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:08.240
 computers such as the classroom of 

00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:10.460
 computing that each student is with a 

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:12.680
 computer that groups them jce in groups 

00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:14.900
 of four that you put to each his 

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:17.420
 headphones and that in a class in 

00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:19.280
 silence in apparent silence from 

00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:21.980
 out for those who do not have headphones 

00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:23.360
 are giving what they are taking place 

00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:26.150
 at that moment 

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:28.370
 with certain or so many jam session 

00:07:26.150 --> 00:07:30.500
 experiments or so many games of 

00:07:28.370 --> 00:07:32.449
 a musical game like groups of four 

00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:34.819
 you can form and that you can coordinate 

00:07:32.449 --> 00:07:38.659
 well because obviously as a 

00:07:34.819 --> 00:07:40.789
 they are not going to hinder others as nothing 

00:07:38.659 --> 00:07:43.939
 I encourage you to experiment with this branch 

00:07:40.789 --> 00:07:47.449
 this tool that you play with it and 

00:07:43.939 --> 00:07:49.310
 that if you want us to pass that 

00:07:47.449 --> 00:07:51.349
 let us get there as you 

00:07:49.310 --> 00:07:52.189
 experimentations because if at any 

00:07:51.349 --> 00:07:53.689
 moment 

00:07:52.189 --> 00:07:56.419
 in which you are carrying out one of 

00:07:53.689 --> 00:07:58.219
 these sessions record the sound of 

00:07:56.419 --> 00:08:00.439
 your computer with an application of 

00:07:58.219 --> 00:08:03.529
 recording audio or recording 

00:08:00.439 --> 00:08:05.469
 Desktop video capture as as 

00:08:03.529 --> 00:08:08.629
 we have seen some already in some other 

00:08:05.469 --> 00:08:11.569
 tutorial or resource project as 

00:08:08.629 --> 00:08:13.849
 you can send us the video of 

00:08:11.569 --> 00:08:15.469
 your musical compositions many 

00:08:13.849 --> 00:08:18.129
 thank you for your attention and until 

00:08:15.469 --> 00:08:18.129
 another moment
