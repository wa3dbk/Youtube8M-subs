the wedge anchor because it's just going

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.350 
the wedge anchor because it's just going
to<00:01:06.960> get<00:01:07.080> hammered<00:01:07.260> in<00:01:07.500> there<00:01:08.150> before<00:01:09.150> you

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
to get hammered in there before you

tip and then it's really hard to thread

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:27.830 
tip and then it's really hard to thread
the<00:01:21.960> nut<00:01:22.110> on<00:01:22.580> and<00:01:25.850> really<00:01:26.850> everything<00:01:27.090> say<00:01:27.570> if

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840
