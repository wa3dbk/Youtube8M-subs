00:01:48.639 --> 00:01:48.649 
a long time these are actually

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:52.139 
a long time these are actually
interspersed<00:01:49.190> with<00:01:49.460> my<00:01:49.640> horseradish<00:01:50.680> plants

hopefully you'll be easier than my

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:16.110 
hopefully you'll be easier than my
horseradish<00:02:10.100> oh<00:02:10.340> yeah<00:02:13.570> well<00:02:14.570> that<00:02:15.080> didn't<00:02:15.410> get

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
horseradish oh yeah well that didn't get

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:23.949 
horseradish oh yeah well that didn't get
too<00:02:17.120> crazy<00:02:17.390> big<00:02:17.780> but<00:02:19.209> interesting<00:02:22.480> it's<00:02:23.480> one<00:02:23.720> I

00:02:23.949 --> 00:02:23.959 
too crazy big but interesting it's one I

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:26.289 
too crazy big but interesting it's one I
think<00:02:24.049> I<00:02:24.260> planted<00:02:24.620> four<00:02:24.920> seeds<00:02:25.370> so

00:02:26.289 --> 00:02:26.299 
think I planted four seeds so

00:02:26.299 --> 00:02:28.259 
think I planted four seeds so
considering<00:02:27.170> there<00:02:27.260> are<00:02:27.320> four<00:02:27.500> little<00:02:27.709> seeds

00:02:28.259 --> 00:02:28.269 
considering there are four little seeds

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:31.300 
considering there are four little seeds
it's<00:02:29.269> pretty<00:02:29.510> impressive<00:02:29.750> I<00:02:30.080> think<00:02:30.290> what<00:02:31.190> you

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:31.310 
it's pretty impressive I think what you

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:36.009 
it's pretty impressive I think what you
get<00:02:32.530> another<00:02:33.530> one<00:02:34.150> and<00:02:35.150> by<00:02:35.660> the<00:02:35.720> way<00:02:35.870> these

00:02:36.009 --> 00:02:36.019 
get another one and by the way these

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:40.720 
get another one and by the way these

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:23.449 
take over there we go I'll do a little
more<00:03:21.599> breathing<00:03:21.750> room<00:03:21.959> for<00:03:22.110> these<00:03:22.459> yeah

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:23.459 
more breathing room for these yeah

more breathing room for these yeah
normally<00:03:23.790> my<00:03:23.940> hearse<00:03:24.120> rash<00:03:24.360> is<00:03:24.569> much<00:03:24.750> more

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 
advanced right now but yeah they got

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:32.120 
advanced right now but yeah they got
choked<00:03:27.420> out<00:03:27.569> by<00:03:28.130> both<00:03:29.130> light<00:03:29.400> and<00:03:29.700> the<00:03:31.130> roots

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:32.130 
choked out by both light and the roots

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:37.400 
choked out by both light and the roots
from<00:03:32.430> these<00:03:32.790> other<00:03:33.260> radishes<00:03:35.870> so<00:03:36.870> not<00:03:37.290> about

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:37.410 
from these other radishes so not about

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:40.220 
from these other radishes so not about
Hulk<00:03:37.739> a<00:03:38.420> lot<00:03:39.420> easier<00:03:39.750> to<00:03:39.840> pull<00:03:39.989> out<00:03:40.080> of<00:03:40.110> the

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:40.230 
Hulk a lot easier to pull out of the

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:41.809 
Hulk a lot easier to pull out of the
ground<00:03:40.440> the<00:03:40.560> horse<00:03:40.769> rush<00:03:40.980> that's<00:03:41.280> for<00:03:41.459> sure

00:03:41.809 --> 00:03:41.819 
ground the horse rush that's for sure

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:44.300 
ground the horse rush that's for sure

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:44.310 
so I Missy basically gonna be simpler

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:46.309 
so I Missy basically gonna be simpler
separating<00:03:44.880> these<00:03:45.000> into<00:03:45.390> four<00:03:46.170> different

00:03:46.309 --> 00:03:46.319 
separating these into four different

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:48.080 
separating these into four different
things<00:03:46.530> I'm<00:03:46.980> gonna<00:03:47.220> take<00:03:47.459> the<00:03:47.610> roots<00:03:47.790> to

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:48.090 
things I'm gonna take the roots to

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:50.020 
things I'm gonna take the roots to
harvest<00:03:48.480> I'm<00:03:49.170> gonna<00:03:49.349> harvest<00:03:49.530> some<00:03:49.799> leaves

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:50.030 
harvest I'm gonna harvest some leaves

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:54.170 
harvest I'm gonna harvest some leaves
I'm<00:03:51.030> gonna<00:03:51.239> harvest<00:03:51.480> the<00:03:52.069> pods<00:03:53.069> for<00:03:53.610> seeds<00:03:53.880> and

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:54.180 
I'm gonna harvest the pods for seeds and

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:56.539 
I'm gonna harvest the pods for seeds and
then<00:03:55.019> whatever's<00:03:55.470> left<00:03:55.680> over<00:03:55.830> that<00:03:56.010> goes<00:03:56.340> my

00:03:56.539 --> 00:03:56.549

00:03:56.549 --> 00:04:01.970 
then whatever's left over that goes my
compost<00:03:58.579> so<00:03:59.579> there<00:03:59.790> we<00:03:59.910> go<00:04:00.060> I<00:04:00.359> got<00:04:01.200> the<00:04:01.470> seed

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:01.980 
compost so there we go I got the seed

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:04.699 
compost so there we go I got the seed
pods<00:04:02.220> in<00:04:02.549> this<00:04:02.820> paper<00:04:03.030> bag<00:04:03.269> that<00:04:04.170> he's<00:04:04.350> out<00:04:04.560> to

00:04:04.699 --> 00:04:04.709 
pods in this paper bag that he's out to

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:07.130 
pods in this paper bag that he's out to
dry<00:04:04.890> things<00:04:04.950> out<00:04:05.250> kind<00:04:06.060> of<00:04:06.120> cure<00:04:06.329> them<00:04:06.510> it's

00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:17.780 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:23.800 

there<00:04:18.650> we<00:04:18.739> go<00:04:18.890> and<00:04:21.430> yeah<00:04:22.430> not<00:04:22.970> gonna<00:04:23.150> win<00:04:23.630> any

there we go and yeah not gonna win any
awards<00:04:24.260> for<00:04:25.300> yield<00:04:26.300> but<00:04:26.660> I<00:04:26.900> think<00:04:27.650> was<00:04:27.740> a<00:04:27.800> good

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:27.920 
awards for yield but I think was a good

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:31.030 
awards for yield but I think was a good
first<00:04:28.160> try<00:04:28.960> probably<00:04:29.960> just<00:04:30.110> need<00:04:30.260> to<00:04:30.410> start<00:04:30.830> a

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:31.040 
first try probably just need to start a

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:33.010 
first try probably just need to start a
little<00:04:31.430> earlier<00:04:31.760> with<00:04:32.120> these<00:04:32.300> they<00:04:32.750> really

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:33.020 
little earlier with these they really

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:35.310 
little earlier with these they really
don't<00:04:33.140> seem<00:04:33.470> to<00:04:33.620> mind<00:04:33.740> the<00:04:33.890> fold<00:04:34.400> at<00:04:34.550> all<00:04:34.670> and

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:35.320 
don't seem to mind the fold at all and

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:37.960 
don't seem to mind the fold at all and
probably<00:04:36.320> a<00:04:36.680> little<00:04:36.860> more<00:04:37.070> fertilizer<00:04:37.610> I

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:37.970 
probably a little more fertilizer I

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:39.760 
probably a little more fertilizer I
didn't<00:04:38.690> really<00:04:38.840> use<00:04:38.990> much<00:04:39.170> other<00:04:39.440> than<00:04:39.500> some

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:39.770 
didn't really use much other than some

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:42.190 
didn't really use much other than some
compost<00:04:40.130> so<00:04:40.550> I'll<00:04:41.300> keep<00:04:41.630> that<00:04:41.720> in<00:04:41.780> mind<00:04:41.900> next

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:42.200 
compost so I'll keep that in mind next

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:45.460 
compost so I'll keep that in mind next
time<00:04:42.700> well<00:04:43.700> I<00:04:43.760> guess<00:04:43.910> that's<00:04:44.150> it<00:04:44.270> have<00:04:45.200> a<00:04:45.260> great

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:45.470 
time well I guess that's it have a great

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:47.680 
time well I guess that's it have a great
day
