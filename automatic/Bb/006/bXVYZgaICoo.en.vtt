00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:17.890
 friend to me for the unboxing video of

 schumi mi 3 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:22.900

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:25.720
 we have a dub cdm version with us 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:28.990
 or the version compatible with the 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:30.789
 Italian 3G networks the first thing that jumps 

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:33.670
 to the eye are the dimensions of the 

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:35.829
 box that compared to the boxes of the 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:38.770
 schumi terminals that we saw up 

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:40.870
 at the moment it is thinner and slightly more 

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:43.540
 wide and taller 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:45.610
 we will understand why in a very short time 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:46.270
 but in the meantime let's open it and see what 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:49.750
