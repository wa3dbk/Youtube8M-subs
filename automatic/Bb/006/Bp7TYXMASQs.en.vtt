00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.009
 hey hi boy scouts with you qyubayt and 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:06.930
 welcome lego worlds we 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:09.059
 we continue to watch it we continue it 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:11.190
 study and today I would like to show you 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:13.440
 how can you earn coins here 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.160
 buy new characters you already 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.650
 found 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.720
 or buy some items for 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.460
 Iâ€™ll just start to tell you about the game 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.949
 about my impressions first how much 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:25.050
 how much did she play play her five 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:27.630
 days that is, it came out on June 1 now 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:30.150
 5 and honestly the game is not really that 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.920
 changed in these 5 days there were some 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.230
 updates that just fixed 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.420
 some bugs in the game 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:39.180
 people had a black screen when i run this 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:41.129
 already it seems like the update was not fixed 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.320
 there was nothing super yet new 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:45.930
 added no character items 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.340
 creatures or something else 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.860
 the game remains in the same stage in which 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.629
 Basically released but this is the first 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.270
 stage it is really good because 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:56.699
 that for the very first version of the game this one 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:59.609
 pasta we now see it pretty good it 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:01.559
 really not bad but I think the game will be soon 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:03.270
 already begin to somehow grow rapidly 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:06.000
 because all the same it is known that 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.530
 By the beginning of 2016, it will already be in 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.100
 the final version that is, it will be 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:13.080
 fully accessible to all non early 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.750
 version here is completely free sale and 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:19.650
 there will be multiplayer even that is 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:21.270
 probably by the end of 2015 will already be 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.439
 somehow work the beta multiplayer test 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.240
 or something like that 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:27.270
 that is, we will see how it will all be me 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.520
 now katif desert about what game 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:32.970
 I found it so interesting in 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:35.159
 In general, I have already opened all the items of all 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:37.200
 characters of all creatures and so far only 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:39.600
 one transport did not open which by the way 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:42.000
 I saw this last transport 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.159
 skateboard I saw him and imagine I 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.740
 I ran after him and he fell into the sea and 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:48.590
 crashed here I couldn't it like 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.820
 study and get yourself 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:52.110
 I probably now they will show 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.390
 because I want to make separate videos 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:57.000
 on characters creatures and transport he 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.770
 so on you understand and basically more 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.479
 there is nothing to learn here, that is, I am for the sake of 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.310
 this and played the game to find 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:04.500
 characters find creatures and so on 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.630
 because while here is a special purpose in the game 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.489
 no how can you build of course but with 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.840
 construction is not all bad i'm not very 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:12.239
 beautifully build 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.830
 Now what else can show you the way yes 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:15.870
 now i can create super cool 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:17.459
 characters now this is a dracula very 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:20.730
 cool character for some reason the truth is not 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:22.860
 you can see his abilities oh well we don't 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:24.810
 for this came here I want to show you 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:27.690
 how can you earn some coins 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:29.190
 because here we are flying 37,000 a very 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:31.110
 problem run and direct current 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:32.610
 murder you need to beat and get 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:36.090
 coins the more you get very 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:37.349
 little very little and if i will you 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:39.420
 use this method which i 

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:41.280
 Well, he found, in principle, very simple 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:43.380
 maybe you yourself guessed yes let's 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:44.400
 probably he started we need to build 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:46.380
 such a little thing 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:48.599
 so where do we put it with you let's 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:50.519
 here here here please 

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:54.209
 wait don't you want to stand there right here 

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:57.209
 Let's thank you, though it is very beautiful 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:03:00.209
 the pyramid here volumes in the game is very 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:01.980
 many biomes about 8 probably for the first 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:03.720
 version there is a lot and by the way these 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:07.709
 cassettes for characters that are in 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:10.860
 the game and they were taken from the axes of the minifigure then 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:15.000
 there are these networks 7:13 they go out already 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:18.780
 over 5 years and here from this of these 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:20.519
 13 series collected 3323 no thirty 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:22.350
 two figures because my one 

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:24.930
 personal i mean i can create 

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:26.819
 a figurine 32 original figurines they 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:28.139
 chose from there and put them in the game 

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:29.970
 then of course it will probably be 

00:03:28.139 --> 00:03:32.190
 added and will be added and 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:34.620
 superhero probably there are all sorts of ninjago and 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:37.680
 star wars maybe i don't know how with that 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:39.299
 things will come down to here a lot of things 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:39.859
 interesting we need here it is 

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:44.180
 here 

00:03:39.859 --> 00:03:47.010
 sausage we open it close and 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:48.780
 we get coins for it 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:51.720
 by the way when you approach it you will study 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:53.130
 and then you can buy and put well, I 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:54.419
 I think that you can accumulate some 

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:56.849
 amount somewhat she stands there 

00:03:54.419 --> 00:03:59.489
 now I find you here then sign 

00:03:56.849 --> 00:04:01.829
 here here in the objects there behind the boy 

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:02.430
 ran and here it is sausage let's 

00:04:01.829 --> 00:04:05.730
 put it 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:10.700
 I donâ€™t know where is more even here 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:12.800
 great set and we go go to her 

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:15.170
 and to get some money and she 

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:16.660
 here are the parties yes a little uncomfortable to 

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:18.489
 get some money we open it 

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:21.859
 shutting down 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:24.500
 I get out of it in my 400 here I 

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:26.810
 now not nearly 400 I think they are 30 

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:28.669
 coins apologizing the coin falls when 

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:30.290
 we do the second time already falls 4 s 

00:04:28.669 --> 00:04:32.000
 half thousand that is see here 

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:35.330
 there is a blue coin which gives thousands 

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:38.290
 here you see here these dads 43 see we 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:40.669
 first time open immediately close 

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:41.960
 we get with thirty coins this 

00:04:40.669 --> 00:04:44.389
 guaranteed meaning nothing changes 

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:46.610
 This is not a random and open again 

00:04:44.389 --> 00:04:47.360
 closing we get four and a half 

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:49.010
 thousands 

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:52.100
 and like this you can stuff in principle 

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:53.300
 imagine yourself well somehow but wisely 

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:56.240
 There is no need for a lot of money here 

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:59.060
 there is a maximum of one character or 

00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:01.610
 any object worth 10,000 is you 

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:03.110
 Look, you got there five times 

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:04.940
 yes and all you can buy yourself 

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:06.710
 dear character basically here 

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:08.270
 a lot do not need you here 40,000 

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:11.090
 probably enough to all 

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:13.970
 buy well or 50 thousand for sure enough 

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:15.950
 you can buy anything you want so 

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:18.080
 that here it is very quick money 

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:20.060
 but I showed it to you so that you would not run 

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:21.320
 didn't hit different trees didn't kill 

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:22.880
 characters I'm just like this 

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:25.220
 quickly saved a bought all that you 

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:27.320
 wanted because on this one on this one 

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:29.510
 this tree tree beats are wasted 

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:32.060
 a lot of time and you think better 

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:34.100
 would you look for characters 

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:36.139
 search for characters and you can easily 

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:38.330
 find if you walk up by 

00:05:36.139 --> 00:05:41.750
 Every house has its own character 

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:43.700
 transportation and your kicked items 

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:46.160
 By the way, here are the items that are here, but I 

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:47.810
 I will not show there very cool items you 

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:50.870
 look better video objects and 

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:53.510
 there are different things there are different 

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:55.340
 banana weapons and even eat them you can 

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:56.870
 find only in big chests there is here 

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:59.360
 I will try such small chests now 

00:05:56.870 --> 00:06:00.710
 find him here and show you somewhere 

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:02.720
 there should be a little one 

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:04.130
 a chest with coins just there coins 

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:06.229
 maybe if you already played them 

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:07.940
 greeted there are still big chests 

00:06:06.229 --> 00:06:10.639
 which are probably two or three times 

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:13.340
 more than these and they somehow have a little bit 

00:06:10.639 --> 00:06:15.260
 the wall looks like you can find them 

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:17.570
 some ruins of some buildings and so 

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:19.640
 further and there you open and receive as 

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:21.080
 since the same thing I do not stand to deliver 

00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:22.240
 such a chest I can not unfortunately but 

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:27.460
 to find 

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:29.169
 find it possible and somewhere okay in 

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:30.520
 principle, I know I think you know such 

00:06:29.169 --> 00:06:33.280
 little chests stand and from there 

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:34.150
 drop a coin that's just wow us 

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:38.110
 then the bugs fell 

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:39.430
 To go nuts yes here if I so also ran 

00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:41.650
 Vogue fell on his head would not be very 

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:43.389
 nice okay did not find i give a chest and 

00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:44.949
 probably this finish I showed you 

00:06:43.389 --> 00:06:47.410
 how can you easily get coins and 

00:06:44.949 --> 00:06:49.259
 buy with the help of them you have already found 

00:06:47.410 --> 00:06:52.240
 characters and objects 

00:06:49.259 --> 00:06:55.330
 what else is animal transport 

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:57.699
 various built object and all this you 

00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:59.860
 can buy with the help of coins that you 

00:06:57.699 --> 00:07:01.509
 received using such lifehack 

00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:03.550
 small, I think it does not 

00:07:01.509 --> 00:07:04.539
 the same no bug i just 

00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:06.550
 such 

00:07:04.539 --> 00:07:08.199
 and you know you are studying some subject 

00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:10.449
 use them and get it for it 

00:07:08.199 --> 00:07:12.190
 coins are in principle honest to this i 

00:07:10.449 --> 00:07:14.259
 I think that we say goodbye if you 

00:07:12.190 --> 00:07:16.240
 want me to show you something 

00:07:14.259 --> 00:07:17.229
 still talked about this game then write to 

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:19.840
 comment because i have 

00:07:17.229 --> 00:07:22.750
 some opinion which was formed 

00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:25.330
 for while i played well i of course 

00:07:22.750 --> 00:07:26.680
 show items characters and creatures and 

00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:28.570
 transport when transport is all on 

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:30.310
 youtube will also show on 

00:07:28.570 --> 00:07:32.409
 this I probably finish until they release
