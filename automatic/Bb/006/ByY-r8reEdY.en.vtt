00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:06.820

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:09.040

 take the character that I had little 

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:43.360
 by admiration but there was that secret 

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:45.640
 that no no I did not have them and that helped me 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:48.370
 much to polish staff and in the 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:51.390
