00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
is that it gives you a new control if

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.109 
is that it gives you a new control if
you<00:01:49.259> go<00:01:49.350> to<00:01:49.409> options<00:01:50.100> right<00:01:50.670> here<00:01:50.700> and<00:01:50.970> you<00:01:51.030> go

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
you go to options right here and you go

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:52.580 
you go to options right here and you go

the<00:02:23.950> standard<00:02:24.310> one<00:02:24.519> there's<00:02:24.790> the<00:02:24.970> smooth<00:02:25.269> one

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.510 
the standard one there's the smooth one

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:28.410 
the standard one there's the smooth one
there's<00:02:25.840> the<00:02:26.019> multi-core<00:02:26.620> in<00:02:26.800> which<00:02:26.950> I<00:02:27.130> use<00:02:27.550> in

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420 
there's the multi-core in which I use in

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:30.509 
there's the multi-core in which I use in
my<00:02:28.480> opinion<00:02:29.050> I<00:02:29.230> think<00:02:29.260> the<00:02:29.590> multi-core<00:02:30.220> is

00:02:30.509 --> 00:02:30.519 
my opinion I think the multi-core is

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:32.940 
my opinion I think the multi-core is
somewhat<00:02:31.390> the<00:02:31.510> best<00:02:31.720> because<00:02:31.930> it<00:02:32.140> extends<00:02:32.769> the

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950 
somewhat the best because it extends the

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:34.860 
somewhat the best because it extends the
smooth<00:02:33.220> one<00:02:33.459> and<00:02:33.670> if<00:02:33.940> you<00:02:34.030> go<00:02:34.209> back<00:02:34.420> and<00:02:34.600> smooth

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:34.870 
smooth one and if you go back and smooth

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:36.840 
smooth one and if you go back and smooth
it<00:02:35.080> extends<00:02:35.530> a<00:02:35.620> standard<00:02:35.980> one<00:02:36.130> if<00:02:36.430> you<00:02:36.580> go<00:02:36.670> back

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:36.850 
it extends a standard one if you go back

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:38.699 
it extends a standard one if you go back
and<00:02:37.030> standard<00:02:37.420> the<00:02:37.780> sander<00:02:38.080> has<00:02:38.200> all<00:02:38.470> this

00:02:38.699 --> 00:02:38.709 
and standard the sander has all this

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:41.340 
and standard the sander has all this
which<00:02:38.950> has<00:02:39.790> built-in<00:02:40.299> support<00:02:40.510> for<00:02:40.750> HD

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:41.350 
which has built-in support for HD

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:42.509 
which has built-in support for HD
texture<00:02:41.769> packs<00:02:41.950> and<00:02:42.100> all<00:02:42.160> that<00:02:42.280> other<00:02:42.370> stuff
