honestly<00:02:19.550> writing<00:02:20.550> is<00:02:21.890> the<00:02:22.890> sort<00:02:23.250> of<00:02:23.340> the<00:02:23.550> real

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
honestly writing is the sort of the real

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:26.450 
honestly writing is the sort of the real
the<00:02:24.090> truest<00:02:24.810> thing<00:02:24.870> I<00:02:25.110> do<00:02:25.170> when<00:02:25.920> I<00:02:25.950> do<00:02:26.040> it<00:02:26.250> well

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:26.460 
the truest thing I do when I do it well

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:29.320 
the truest thing I do when I do it well
and<00:02:26.760> it's<00:02:26.940> I<00:02:27.210> don't<00:02:27.390> always<00:02:27.660> do<00:02:27.930> it<00:02:27.960> well<00:02:28.220> but

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:29.330 
and it's I don't always do it well but

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:32.390 
and it's I don't always do it well but
so<00:02:30.330> I<00:02:30.360> think<00:02:30.480> you<00:02:30.900> know<00:02:30.990> coming<00:02:31.890> to<00:02:32.010> a<00:02:32.100> moment

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
when I could I could produce something

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:37.370 
when I could I could produce something
that<00:02:33.840> was<00:02:34.050> mine<00:02:34.370> and<00:02:35.630> someone<00:02:36.630> wanted<00:02:37.200> to

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
print it out and that I was you know I I

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:43.070 
print it out and that I was you know I I
could<00:02:40.440> actually<00:02:40.560> say<00:02:40.890> I<00:02:40.920> made<00:02:41.520> this<00:02:41.870> has<00:02:42.870> been

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.080 
could actually say I made this has been

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:45.140 
could actually say I made this has been
you<00:02:43.560> know<00:02:43.620> it's<00:02:43.800> profoundly<00:02:44.520> life<00:02:44.760> changing
