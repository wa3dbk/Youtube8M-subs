00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
megahertz so let's super got any

00:00:49.440 --> 00:01:01.530 
megahertz so let's super got any
batteries<00:00:49.890> in<00:00:50.039> it

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:01.540 

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:09.700 

little<00:01:02.540> bit<00:01:02.660> of<00:01:03.430> green<00:01:04.430> on<00:01:04.460> there<00:01:08.380> and<00:01:09.380> we<00:01:09.530> need

little bit of green on there and we need

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:12.990 
little bit of green on there and we need
one<00:01:10.190> two<00:01:10.430> three<00:01:10.820> four<00:01:11.150> five<00:01:11.480> six<00:01:11.780> seven<00:01:12.200> eight

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:13.000 
one two three four five six seven eight

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:33.440 
one two three four five six seven eight
okay<00:01:15.280> let<00:01:16.280> it<00:01:16.310> go<00:01:16.400> and<00:01:16.610> get<00:01:16.700> eight<00:01:16.880> batteries

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:54.200 

some<00:01:34.450> of<00:01:34.570> these<00:01:34.659> look<00:01:34.869> a<00:01:34.990> little<00:01:35.020> bit<00:01:35.320> rusty

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:02:01.480 

not<00:01:55.210> looking<00:01:55.540> good

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:01.490 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:31.670 

it's<00:02:02.030> 27<00:02:02.630> megahertz

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.140 

so<00:02:32.680> it's<00:02:32.950> just<00:02:33.069> a<00:02:33.220> bit<00:02:33.340> of<00:02:33.430> corrosion<00:02:33.670> along

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
so it's just a bit of corrosion along

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:49.530 
so it's just a bit of corrosion along
there<00:02:46.800> well<00:02:47.800> that<00:02:47.920> looks<00:02:48.130> good<00:02:48.370> might<00:02:49.270> need<00:02:49.420> to

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:49.540 
there well that looks good might need to

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:52.020 
there well that looks good might need to
clean<00:02:50.200> up<00:02:50.470> those<00:02:50.650> contacts<00:02:51.250> but<00:02:51.520> we'll<00:02:51.670> try<00:02:52.000> it

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.030 
clean up those contacts but we'll try it

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:58.470 
clean up those contacts but we'll try it
exactly<00:02:52.630> as<00:02:52.780> it<00:02:52.930> is<00:02:56.280> some<00:02:57.280> fortunate<00:02:57.790> is<00:02:57.910> 27

00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:58.480 
exactly as it is some fortunate is 27

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:00.479 
exactly as it is some fortunate is 27
megahertz<00:02:59.019> cuz<00:02:59.170> that's<00:02:59.290> what<00:02:59.440> that<00:02:59.590> big<00:02:59.800> truck

00:03:00.479 --> 00:03:00.489 
megahertz cuz that's what that big truck

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:03.660 
megahertz cuz that's what that big truck
is<00:03:00.730> I<00:03:00.910> thought<00:03:02.010> it<00:03:03.010> would<00:03:03.100> have<00:03:03.190> been<00:03:03.280> nice<00:03:03.489> if

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:03.670 
is I thought it would have been nice if

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:05.370 
is I thought it would have been nice if
it<00:03:03.790> was<00:03:03.850> 40<00:03:04.360> or<00:03:04.390> something<00:03:04.810> so<00:03:04.959> we<00:03:05.080> could<00:03:05.170> race

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:05.380 
it was 40 or something so we could race

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:32.069 
it was 40 or something so we could race
them<00:03:05.590> both<00:03:05.769> together

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:32.079 

00:03:32.079 --> 00:03:39.640 

well<00:03:33.079> that<00:03:33.829> looks<00:03:34.040> like<00:03:34.129> that<00:03:34.310> works<00:03:38.650> let's

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:39.650 
well that looks like that works let's

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:41.229 
well that looks like that works let's
try<00:03:39.889> putting<00:03:40.069> a<00:03:40.219> little<00:03:40.250> camera<00:03:40.790> on<00:03:40.939> it<00:03:41.090> and

00:03:41.229 --> 00:03:41.239 
try putting a little camera on it and

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:44.589 
try putting a little camera on it and
see<00:03:41.450> what<00:03:41.569> it's<00:03:41.689> like<00:03:43.090> I'm<00:03:44.090> not<00:03:44.239> sure<00:03:44.420> if<00:03:44.480> this

00:03:44.589 --> 00:03:44.599 
see what it's like I'm not sure if this

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:47.409 
see what it's like I'm not sure if this
one's<00:03:44.810> charged<00:03:45.260> up<00:03:45.530> oh<00:03:45.799> yeah<00:03:46.790> lights<00:03:47.150> coming

00:03:47.409 --> 00:03:47.419 
one's charged up oh yeah lights coming

00:03:47.419 --> 00:04:00.309 
one's charged up oh yeah lights coming
on

00:04:00.309 --> 00:04:00.319 

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:13.600 

should<00:04:01.099> be<00:04:01.280> Chuck<00:04:01.579> should<00:04:01.969> be<00:04:02.120> recording

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:13.610 

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:33.159 

let's<00:04:14.210> go<00:04:14.420> for<00:04:14.720> it<00:04:21.010> recording

00:04:33.159 --> 00:04:33.169 

00:04:33.169 --> 00:05:56.670 

that's<00:04:33.560> good<00:04:33.800> for<00:04:34.099> it

00:05:56.670 --> 00:05:56.680 

00:05:56.680 --> 00:06:15.390 

I<00:06:04.380> should<00:06:05.380> do<00:06:11.280> so<00:06:12.280> quick<00:06:12.520> summary<00:06:13.289> the<00:06:14.400> range

00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:15.400 
I should do so quick summary the range

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:17.610 
I should do so quick summary the range
was<00:06:15.669> a<00:06:15.699> bit<00:06:15.910> short<00:06:16.210> and<00:06:17.199> I<00:06:17.229> think<00:06:17.470> that's

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:17.620 
was a bit short and I think that's

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:20.879 
was a bit short and I think that's
because<00:06:18.270> the<00:06:19.270> area<00:06:19.630> was<00:06:19.780> missing<00:06:20.199> it<00:06:20.680> should

00:06:20.879 --> 00:06:20.889 
because the area was missing it should

00:06:20.889 --> 00:06:22.680 
because the area was missing it should
be<00:06:21.009> coming<00:06:21.310> up<00:06:21.400> through<00:06:21.580> a<00:06:21.669> hole<00:06:21.850> just<00:06:22.120> there

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:22.690 
be coming up through a hole just there

00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:28.350 
be coming up through a hole just there
I<00:06:22.720> did<00:06:23.530> notice<00:06:23.770> earlier<00:06:24.930> there<00:06:25.930> is<00:06:27.000> side<00:06:28.000> look

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:28.360 
I did notice earlier there is side look

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:30.390 
I did notice earlier there is side look
I'll<00:06:28.630> probably<00:06:29.289> have<00:06:29.500> to<00:06:29.560> put<00:06:29.680> a<00:06:29.710> new<00:06:29.919> aerial

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:30.400 
I'll probably have to put a new aerial

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:33.270 
I'll probably have to put a new aerial
on<00:06:30.550> it<00:06:30.699> long<00:06:31.210> a<00:06:31.240> bit<00:06:31.449> of<00:06:31.539> wire<00:06:32.009> but<00:06:33.009> other<00:06:33.130> than

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:33.280 
on it long a bit of wire but other than

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:39.120 
on it long a bit of wire but other than
that<00:06:33.389> it<00:06:34.389> works<00:06:35.490> so<00:06:37.110> 2-pound<00:06:38.110> from<00:06:38.979> the

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:39.130 
that it works so 2-pound from the

00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:41.730 
that it works so 2-pound from the
charity<00:06:39.550> shop<00:06:39.759> and<00:06:40.750> we<00:06:40.870> got<00:06:41.020> another<00:06:41.229> working

00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:41.740 
charity shop and we got another working

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:48.480 
charity shop and we got another working
car<00:06:46.680> but<00:06:47.680> we<00:06:47.770> could<00:06:47.889> do<00:06:48.009> with<00:06:48.130> a<00:06:48.160> bit<00:06:48.250> more

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:48.490 
car but we could do with a bit more

00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:50.490 
car but we could do with a bit more
range<00:06:48.759> on<00:06:49.030> our<00:06:49.150> to<00:06:49.419> run<00:06:49.599> behind<00:06:49.930> it<00:06:50.229> to<00:06:50.320> keep

00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:50.500 
range on our to run behind it to keep

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:52.979 
range on our to run behind it to keep
control
