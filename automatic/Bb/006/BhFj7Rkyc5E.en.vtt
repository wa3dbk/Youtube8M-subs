solving compound inequalities here are
some<00:00:13.290> absolute<00:00:13.710> value<00:00:14.009> inequalities<00:00:14.610> and

inequality by adding 12 to both sides

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:09.940

and<00:03:07.550> we<00:03:08.270> cancel<00:03:08.720> the<00:03:08.810> negative<00:03:09.170> 12<00:03:09.380> plus<00:03:09.680> 12

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:09.950 
and we cancel the negative 12 plus 12

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:12.520 
and we cancel the negative 12 plus 12
for<00:03:10.220> each<00:03:10.400> inequality<00:03:11.090> and<00:03:12.080> we<00:03:12.170> bring<00:03:12.350> down

what's<00:03:12.770> left<00:03:16.180> now<00:03:17.180> we<00:03:17.240> now<00:03:17.540> divide<00:03:17.750> each

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:18.110 
what's left now we now divide each

now<00:03:47.870> let's<00:03:48.020> look<00:03:48.110> at<00:03:48.230> this<00:03:48.380> one<00:03:48.650> the<00:03:48.950> absolute

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:49.340 
now let's look at this one the absolute

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:54.090 
now let's look at this one the absolute
value<00:03:49.730> of<00:03:49.760> 3x<00:03:50.600> plus<00:03:51.080> 4<00:03:51.350> is<00:03:51.620> less<00:03:52.400> than<00:03:52.459> 10<00:03:53.030> is

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:54.100 
value of 3x plus 4 is less than 10 is

00:03:54.100 --> 00:04:00.400 
value of 3x plus 4 is less than 10 is
this<00:03:55.540> one<00:03:56.540> more<00:03:56.840> or<00:03:57.080> or<00:03:57.920> is<00:03:58.160> it<00:03:58.310> less<00:03:59.230> it's<00:04:00.230> less

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:00.410 
this one more or or is it less it's less

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:02.860 
this one more or or is it less it's less
so<00:04:00.830> we<00:04:00.950> should<00:04:01.130> remember<00:04:01.220> that<00:04:01.520> less<00:04:02.000> is<00:04:02.209> neste

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:02.870 
so we should remember that less is neste

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:06.190 
so we should remember that less is neste
remember<00:04:03.320> less<00:04:03.530> is<00:04:03.800> nest<00:04:04.510> for<00:04:05.510> less<00:04:05.810> is<00:04:05.959> nest

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:06.200 
remember less is nest for less is nest

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:08.290 
remember less is nest for less is nest
we<00:04:06.380> start<00:04:06.800> with<00:04:07.010> the<00:04:07.130> negative<00:04:07.520> of<00:04:07.730> the<00:04:07.850> number

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:08.300 
we start with the negative of the number

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:11.080 
we start with the negative of the number
on<00:04:08.450> the<00:04:08.540> right<00:04:08.720> which<00:04:09.440> is<00:04:09.650> negative<00:04:10.130> 10<00:04:10.340> then

on the right which is negative 10 then

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:17.380 
on the right which is negative 10 then

the video see if you can solve this

on<00:05:44.800> a<00:05:44.860> number<00:05:44.950> line<00:05:45.190> then<00:05:45.550> restart<00:05:46.030> it<00:05:46.120> to<00:05:46.240> see

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:46.390 
on a number line then restart it to see

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:52.040 
on a number line then restart it to see
if<00:05:46.510> you<00:05:46.660> solved<00:05:47.020> it<00:05:47.110> correctly

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:52.050 

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:54.800 

this<00:05:52.650> is<00:05:52.889> less<00:05:53.160> than<00:05:53.370> Seoul<00:05:53.699> s<00:05:53.910> is<00:05:54.060> nest<00:05:54.330> so<00:05:54.690> we

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:54.810 
this is less than Seoul s is nest so we

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:57.279 
this is less than Seoul s is nest so we
bring<00:05:55.020> bring<00:05:55.470> it<00:05:55.560> down<00:05:55.710> like<00:05:55.740> this

00:05:57.279 --> 00:05:57.289 
bring bring it down like this

00:05:57.289 --> 00:05:59.360 
bring bring it down like this
so<00:05:58.289> we<00:05:58.410> have<00:05:58.590> our<00:05:58.620> three-headed<00:05:59.220> monster

00:05:59.360 --> 00:05:59.370 
so we have our three-headed monster

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:04.249 
so we have our three-headed monster
again<00:06:00.949> we<00:06:01.949> get<00:06:02.159> rid<00:06:02.340> of<00:06:02.370> the<00:06:02.490> negative<00:06:02.819> 3<00:06:03.259> by

00:06:04.249 --> 00:06:04.259 
again we get rid of the negative 3 by

00:06:04.259 --> 00:06:05.960 
again we get rid of the negative 3 by
adding<00:06:04.470> 3<00:06:04.830> to<00:06:04.979> each<00:06:05.039> expression<00:06:05.639> and<00:06:05.789> bring

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:05.970 
adding 3 to each expression and bring

00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:09.980 
adding 3 to each expression and bring
the<00:06:06.090> rest<00:06:06.300> down<00:06:07.940> then<00:06:08.940> we<00:06:09.210> need<00:06:09.389> to<00:06:09.479> divide<00:06:09.750> by

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:09.990 
the rest down then we need to divide by

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:11.839 
the rest down then we need to divide by
6<00:06:10.289> then<00:06:10.590> cancel<00:06:11.009> the<00:06:11.069> sixes<00:06:11.430> bring<00:06:11.699> down

00:06:11.839 --> 00:06:11.849 
6 then cancel the sixes bring down

00:06:11.849 --> 00:06:14.390 
6 then cancel the sixes bring down

is<00:07:05.069> the<00:07:05.190> absolute<00:07:05.550> value<00:07:05.669> inequality<00:07:06.360> graphed

is the absolute value inequality graphed

on the number line here we have greater

on the number line here we have greater
than<00:07:09.779> 10<00:07:10.050> and<00:07:10.259> less<00:07:10.349> than<00:07:11.310> negative<00:07:11.969> 2<00:07:13.580> this

inequalities<00:07:16.650> I<00:07:16.740> hope<00:07:16.919> the<00:07:17.039> lesson<00:07:17.310> has<00:07:17.370> been

00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:17.430 
inequalities I hope the lesson has been

00:07:17.430 --> 00:07:20.630 
inequalities I hope the lesson has been
helpful<00:07:17.759> thanks
