to<00:05:08.710> an<00:05:08.830> ape<00:05:08.949> to<00:05:08.979> because<00:05:09.430> they're<00:05:09.610> you<00:05:09.789> know

00:05:09.899 --> 00:05:09.909 
to an ape to because they're you know

00:05:09.909 --> 00:05:11.760 
to an ape to because they're you know
like<00:05:10.599> they're<00:05:10.719> turning<00:05:10.960> into<00:05:11.169> humans<00:05:11.620> but

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:11.770 
like they're turning into humans but

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:14.070 
like they're turning into humans but
they<00:05:11.919> it's<00:05:12.520> kind<00:05:12.729> of<00:05:12.759> like<00:05:12.909> they<00:05:13.719> haven't<00:05:13.900> made

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:14.080

the mistakes we have and they don't have
the<00:05:15.669> brain<00:05:16.180> I<00:05:16.389> guess<00:05:16.599> like<00:05:16.779> or<00:05:16.960> the

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:17.050

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:18.959 
the brain I guess like or the
Linguistics<00:05:17.620> to<00:05:17.800> get<00:05:18.009> to<00:05:18.129> there<00:05:18.279> but<00:05:18.520> they're

00:05:18.959 --> 00:05:18.969 
Linguistics to get to there but they're

00:05:18.969 --> 00:05:20.429 
Linguistics to get to there but they're
still<00:05:19.210> like<00:05:19.360> an<00:05:19.449> aggressive<00:05:19.629> species<00:05:20.050> against

00:05:20.429 --> 00:05:20.439 
still like an aggressive species against

00:05:20.439 --> 00:05:22.290

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:22.300 
an aggressive species that haven't had

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:23.700 
an aggressive species that haven't had
that<00:05:22.539> competition<00:05:22.930> right<00:05:23.259> they're<00:05:23.469> still

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:23.710 
that competition right they're still

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:25.649 
that competition right they're still
like<00:05:23.860> they<00:05:24.339> can<00:05:24.520> be<00:05:24.639> wounded<00:05:25.029> unlike<00:05:25.419> unlike
