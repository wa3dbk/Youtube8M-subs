itself so we are going to fold the paper
the<00:02:43.620> long<00:02:43.950> way<00:02:44.220> so<00:02:44.760> that<00:02:45.030> it<00:02:45.120> makes<00:02:45.269> a<00:02:45.420> long

00:02:45.649 --> 00:02:45.659 
the long way so that it makes a long

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
skinny rectangle and we're going to fold

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:54.259 
skinny rectangle and we're going to fold
it<00:02:48.090> in<00:02:48.269> half<00:02:52.129> once<00:02:53.129> again<00:02:53.400> that<00:02:53.819> long<00:02:54.060> skinny

00:02:54.259 --> 00:02:54.269 
it in half once again that long skinny

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:58.759 
it in half once again that long skinny
rectangle<00:02:54.450> is<00:02:55.170> key<00:02:56.040> in<00:02:56.370> this<00:02:56.609> case<00:02:57.769> once

00:02:58.759 --> 00:02:58.769 
rectangle is key in this case once

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:00.170

back up again so now you can see this

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:07.580 
back up again so now you can see this
crease<00:03:03.989> here<00:03:05.120> we<00:03:06.120> are<00:03:06.150> going<00:03:06.569> to<00:03:06.750> fold<00:03:07.079> the

crease here we are going to fold the
paper<00:03:07.799> in<00:03:08.250> half<00:03:13.940> very<00:03:14.940> neatly<00:03:15.239> so<00:03:15.810> that<00:03:16.019> it's<00:03:16.200> a

00:03:16.309 --> 00:03:16.319 
paper in half very neatly so that it's a

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:18.680 
paper in half very neatly so that it's a
short<00:03:16.790> rectangle<00:03:17.790> instead<00:03:18.000> of<00:03:18.180> a<00:03:18.239> long<00:03:18.419> skinny

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690 
short rectangle instead of a long skinny

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:20.620 
short rectangle instead of a long skinny

00:03:23.809 --> 00:03:23.819 
now without opening it up I'm turning it

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:26.390 
now without opening it up I'm turning it
so<00:03:24.120> it's<00:03:24.660> folded<00:03:25.319> like<00:03:25.470> a<00:03:25.500> book<00:03:25.739> I'm<00:03:26.099> going<00:03:26.310> to

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:17.959 
neatness counts with this one guys

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:22.820 
neatness counts with this one guys
so<00:04:18.959> you've<00:04:19.349> created<00:04:19.560> what<00:04:20.250> looks<00:04:20.280> like<00:04:20.549> a<00:04:21.590> W<00:04:22.590> on

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:22.830 
so you've created what looks like a W on

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:25.030 
so you've created what looks like a W on
the<00:04:23.099> side<00:04:23.340> or<00:04:23.700> and

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:25.040 
the side or and

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:27.810 
the side or and
them<00:04:25.130> and<00:04:25.900> it's<00:04:26.900> sort<00:04:27.200> of<00:04:27.230> an<00:04:27.380> accordion

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:27.820 
them and it's sort of an accordion

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:31.510 
them and it's sort of an accordion
folded<00:04:28.820> sheet<00:04:29.030> of<00:04:29.150> paper<00:04:29.950> now<00:04:30.950> here's<00:04:31.310> where

folded sheet of paper now here's where

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:34.780 
folded sheet of paper now here's where
the<00:04:31.700> cut<00:04:31.910> comes<00:04:32.240> in<00:04:32.480> and<00:04:32.720> it<00:04:33.200> is<00:04:33.410> so<00:04:33.950> super

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:34.790 
the cut comes in and it is so super

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:37.990 
the cut comes in and it is so super
important<00:04:35.510> to<00:04:35.570> cut<00:04:36.020> in<00:04:36.200> the<00:04:36.410> right<00:04:36.590> place<00:04:37.070> okay

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:38.000

I'm<00:04:38.840> going<00:04:39.200> to<00:04:39.260> unfold<00:04:39.770> these<00:04:40.310> two<00:04:41.620> flaps<00:04:42.620> like

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:43.250 
I'm going to unfold these two flaps like

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:46.240 
I'm going to unfold these two flaps like
so<00:04:43.580> and<00:04:43.850> I'm<00:04:44.810> going<00:04:44.840> to<00:04:45.140> start<00:04:45.380> my<00:04:45.560> scissors<00:04:46.040> at

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:46.250 
so and I'm going to start my scissors at

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:50.860 
so and I'm going to start my scissors at
the<00:04:46.580> fold<00:04:47.200> once<00:04:48.200> again<00:04:48.530> at<00:04:48.800> a<00:04:49.220> fold<00:04:49.600> super<00:04:50.600> key

the fold once again at a fold super key

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:53.290 
the fold once again at a fold super key
if<00:04:51.140> you<00:04:51.410> fold<00:04:51.770> in<00:04:52.040> from<00:04:52.310> the<00:04:52.460> two<00:04:52.610> flaps<00:04:52.910> it

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:53.300 
if you fold in from the two flaps it

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:55.690 
if you fold in from the two flaps it
will<00:04:53.660> not<00:04:54.380> do<00:04:54.620> what<00:04:54.770> it's<00:04:54.950> supposed<00:04:55.010> to<00:04:55.280> do<00:04:55.430> and

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:55.700 
will not do what it's supposed to do and

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:57.070 
will not do what it's supposed to do and
you'll<00:04:56.180> need<00:04:56.330> to<00:04:56.450> get<00:04:56.570> another<00:04:56.780> piece<00:04:57.020> of

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:57.080 
you'll need to get another piece of

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:57.700 
you'll need to get another piece of
paper

00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:57.710

so<00:04:58.670> starting<00:04:59.570> the<00:04:59.690> scissors<00:05:00.020> at<00:05:00.200> the<00:05:00.500> fold<00:05:00.800> you

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:01.190 
so starting the scissors at the fold you

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:05.740 
so starting the scissors at the fold you
are<00:05:02.090> going<00:05:02.330> to<00:05:02.450> cut<00:05:04.270> okay<00:05:05.270> for<00:05:05.510> viewing

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:05.750 
are going to cut okay for viewing

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:08.860 
are going to cut okay for viewing
purposes<00:05:06.790> I'm<00:05:07.790> just<00:05:08.060> going<00:05:08.240> to<00:05:08.330> draw<00:05:08.510> a<00:05:08.660> line

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:08.870 
purposes I'm just going to draw a line

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:10.960 
purposes I'm just going to draw a line
where<00:05:09.260> the<00:05:09.470> fold<00:05:09.740> is<00:05:09.950> you<00:05:10.610> won't<00:05:10.790> actually

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:10.970 
where the fold is you won't actually

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:13.030 
where the fold is you won't actually
need<00:05:11.270> to<00:05:11.420> draw<00:05:11.630> a<00:05:11.660> line<00:05:11.960> because<00:05:12.230> you<00:05:12.680> have

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:13.040 
need to draw a line because you have

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:15.940 
need to draw a line because you have
already<00:05:13.490> folded<00:05:13.700> it<00:05:14.000> so<00:05:14.210> I<00:05:14.450> can<00:05:15.260> see<00:05:15.440> the<00:05:15.560> folds

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:15.950 
already folded it so I can see the folds

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:18.190 
already folded it so I can see the folds
but<00:05:16.220> you<00:05:17.030> guys<00:05:17.180> can't<00:05:17.540> see<00:05:17.780> the<00:05:17.900> folds

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:18.200 
but you guys can't see the folds

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:22.060 
but you guys can't see the folds
unfortunately<00:05:18.980> so<00:05:19.190> that's<00:05:19.400> where<00:05:19.780> the<00:05:21.070> lines

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:22.070 
unfortunately so that's where the lines

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:24.120 
unfortunately so that's where the lines
coming<00:05:22.400> in<00:05:22.610> I'm<00:05:22.820> just<00:05:23.000> going<00:05:23.180> to<00:05:23.210> draw<00:05:23.420> a<00:05:23.450> line

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:24.130 
coming in I'm just going to draw a line

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:29.110 
coming in I'm just going to draw a line
from<00:05:25.130> where<00:05:25.430> the<00:05:25.640> two<00:05:25.960> folds<00:05:27.100> meet<00:05:28.100> out<00:05:28.550> to<00:05:29.000> the

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:29.120 
from where the two folds meet out to the

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:34.780 
from where the two folds meet out to the
edge<00:05:29.270> and<00:05:29.830> this<00:05:30.830> is<00:05:31.010> the<00:05:31.220> folded<00:05:32.180> edge<00:05:33.490> okay<00:05:34.490> so

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:34.790 
edge and this is the folded edge okay so

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:36.790 
edge and this is the folded edge okay so
I'm<00:05:35.180> just<00:05:35.240> going<00:05:35.750> to<00:05:35.810> cut<00:05:35.990> along<00:05:36.200> that<00:05:36.410> line

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:36.800 
I'm just going to cut along that line

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:38.800 
I'm just going to cut along that line
again<00:05:37.580> you<00:05:37.730> don't<00:05:37.850> need<00:05:38.090> to<00:05:38.180> draw<00:05:38.360> this<00:05:38.540> line

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:38.810 
again you don't need to draw this line

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:41.830 
again you don't need to draw this line
it<00:05:39.050> will<00:05:39.470> be<00:05:39.740> in<00:05:40.010> obvious<00:05:40.370> to<00:05:41.030> you<00:05:41.210> when<00:05:41.750> you

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:41.840 
it will be in obvious to you when you

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:43.720 
it will be in obvious to you when you
fold<00:05:42.050> it<00:05:42.230> where<00:05:42.620> the<00:05:42.800> fold<00:05:43.010> line<00:05:43.220> is<00:05:43.400> so<00:05:43.610> you're

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:43.730 
fold it where the fold line is so you're

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:45.970 
fold it where the fold line is so you're
just<00:05:43.910> cutting<00:05:44.090> along<00:05:44.360> the<00:05:44.510> fold<00:05:44.720> line<00:05:44.960> up<00:05:45.200> to

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:45.980 
just cutting along the fold line up to

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:48.490 
just cutting along the fold line up to
the<00:05:46.070> middle<00:05:46.250> of<00:05:46.430> the<00:05:46.550> paper<00:05:46.790> and<00:05:47.350> you'll<00:05:48.350> know

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:48.500 
the middle of the paper and you'll know

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:50.050 
the middle of the paper and you'll know
it's<00:05:48.680> the<00:05:48.770> middle<00:05:48.980> because<00:05:49.400> that's<00:05:49.640> where<00:05:49.910> the

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:50.060 
it's the middle because that's where the

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:55.270 
it's the middle because that's where the
two<00:05:50.240> folds<00:05:50.690> intersect<00:05:51.320> just<00:05:53.110> like<00:05:54.110> that<00:05:54.290> here

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:55.280 
two folds intersect just like that here

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:56.700 
two folds intersect just like that here
comes<00:05:55.670> the<00:05:55.910> fun<00:05:56.090> part

00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:56.710 
comes the fun part

00:05:56.710 --> 00:05:59.350 
comes the fun part
super<00:05:57.710> super<00:05:57.920> simple<00:05:58.280> you're<00:05:58.640> going<00:05:58.760> to<00:05:58.820> fold

00:05:59.350 --> 00:05:59.360 
super super simple you're going to fold

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:02.830 
super super simple you're going to fold
it<00:05:59.510> back<00:05:59.540> out<00:05:59.870> to<00:05:59.900> a<00:06:00.880> full<00:06:01.880> sheet<00:06:02.150> so<00:06:02.600> now<00:06:02.780> you

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:02.840 
it back out to a full sheet so now you

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:04.450 
it back out to a full sheet so now you
have<00:06:03.050> a<00:06:03.080> slit<00:06:03.380> in<00:06:03.590> the<00:06:03.650> middle<00:06:03.800> of<00:06:04.130> the<00:06:04.280> sheet

00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:04.460 
have a slit in the middle of the sheet

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:06.490 
have a slit in the middle of the sheet
so<00:06:04.910> now<00:06:05.270> that<00:06:05.330> your<00:06:05.570> like<00:06:05.720> this<00:06:05.900> you<00:06:06.140> just<00:06:06.290> go

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:06.500 
so now that your like this you just go

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:08.470 
so now that your like this you just go
the<00:06:06.680> way<00:06:06.800> the<00:06:06.950> fold<00:06:07.190> wants<00:06:07.610> to<00:06:07.760> go<00:06:07.910> along<00:06:08.270> the

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:08.480 
the way the fold wants to go along the

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:13.830 
the way the fold wants to go along the
long<00:06:08.690> line<00:06:09.020> like<00:06:09.890> this<00:06:10.220> and<00:06:10.960> then<00:06:11.960> press<00:06:12.890> your

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:13.840 
long line like this and then press your

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:16.360 
long line like this and then press your
two<00:06:14.840> sides<00:06:15.140> together<00:06:15.410> so<00:06:15.860> see<00:06:16.010> how<00:06:16.130> I<00:06:16.160> have<00:06:16.310> a

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:16.370 
two sides together so see how I have a

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:18.670 
two sides together so see how I have a
plus<00:06:16.610> sign<00:06:17.050> just<00:06:18.050> going<00:06:18.200> to<00:06:18.260> do<00:06:18.350> that<00:06:18.500> real

00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:18.680 
plus sign just going to do that real

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:20.110 
plus sign just going to do that real
quickly<00:06:18.890> so<00:06:19.130> you<00:06:19.220> don't<00:06:19.370> have<00:06:19.490> to<00:06:19.610> rewind<00:06:19.940> it

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:20.120 
quickly so you don't have to rewind it
