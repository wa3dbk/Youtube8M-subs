00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:07.819
 the first piece that we're going to 

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:10.460
 model is the worst the method is the 

00:00:07.819 --> 00:00:13.270
 next we set out to create 

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:13.270
 James 

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:16.750
 we just need 

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:22.520
 in the first half 

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:25.400
 of our figure and then we're going to 

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:27.700
 add a modifier to do the 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.700
 revolution 

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:33.079
 The fewer clicks you see, the better 

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:35.180
 because later it's easier to edit or 

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:39.110
 to configure 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:42.400
 if they want to make straight lines when 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:42.400
 ronald is only about xy 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:51.090
 in the music panel 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.329
 we can change the vertices of this 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.250
 figure 

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:58.880
 and among the most common methods for 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:01:02.030
 create curves one of them is select 

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:05.120
 the real vertices right click and 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:08.020
 convert smoothed curves this 

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:12.689
 works well for open curves 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:12.689
 in the case of tight curves like these 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:16.350
 we would be another method that is 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:19.390
 the tool 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:25.080
 having selected at the vertices 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:26.700
 if we give them sustained click and 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.659
 we drag the 2 up or towards 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:32.909
 down 

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:32.909
 of the two vertices that are created 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.869
 the vertices once they have been 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.960
 created these can be moved from the place 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:49.530
 with the tool 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:49.530
 Let's see 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:17.020
 another one of the methods to create or generate 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:19.140
 curves 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:22.100
 use 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:22.100
 the type of curve 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:30.620
 the curve times comes with modifiers 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:30.620
 like the one that I can move them 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:36.060
 adjust 

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:36.060
 the curve format 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:49.520
 in the case of the corners I can 

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:49.520
 use corners times 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:55.640
 can generate curves but with efe 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:01.629
 to the line 

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:14.600
 this is the result but so we see 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.760
 the alignment to minimum 

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:19.190
 this would be the result and this is the 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:20.960
 result we are looking for there are only two 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:23.290
 things to do here 

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:24.790
 3 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:27.900
 on Mondays 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:31.840
 increase that you have immense 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:35.319
 a number of segments is going to be that 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:40.170
 our curve segments are 

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:40.170
 precisely the curves or more straight 

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:46.030
 x is more than welcome activate 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:51.239
 and finally 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:56.520
 modifier 

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:56.520
 and it's called fields 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:06.450
 This is 

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:10.580
 Y
