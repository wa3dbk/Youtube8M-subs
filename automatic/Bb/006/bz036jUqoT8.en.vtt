want the width and the height to be a
multiple<00:00:24.240> of<00:00:24.510> 16<00:00:25.080> so<00:00:26.070> for<00:00:26.340> mine<00:00:26.550> I'm<00:00:26.849> going<00:00:26.970> to

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
multiple of 16 so for mine I'm going to

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.689 
multiple of 16 so for mine I'm going to
do<00:00:27.269> 320<00:00:28.199> by<00:00:28.439> 160<00:00:29.250> because<00:00:29.429> they're<00:00:29.580> both

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
do 320 by 160 because they're both

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:34.280 
do 320 by 160 because they're both
multiples<00:00:30.150> of<00:00:30.210> 16<00:00:30.570> and<00:00:31.640> then<00:00:33.050> make<00:00:34.050> a<00:00:34.079> new

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
multiples of 16 and then make a new

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:35.990 
multiples of 16 and then make a new
layer<00:00:34.500> and<00:00:34.770> then<00:00:35.010> delete<00:00:35.340> the<00:00:35.460> original<00:00:35.550> layer

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
layer and then delete the original layer

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.069 
layer and then delete the original layer
that<00:00:36.180> was<00:00:36.329> there<00:00:36.510> sages<00:00:36.840> have<00:00:36.960> this

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
that if you spray this a lot of colors

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:51.830 
that if you spray this a lot of colors
or<00:00:50.579> it's<00:00:50.700> really<00:00:50.910> high<00:00:51.059> detail<00:00:51.449> it's<00:00:51.629> going<00:00:51.780> to

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
or it's really high detail it's going to

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.229 
or it's really high detail it's going to
look<00:00:51.960> really<00:00:52.199> bad<00:00:52.469> in<00:00:52.710> game<00:00:52.980> because<00:00:53.399> the

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
look really bad in game because the

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:57.950 
look really bad in game because the
counter-strike<00:00:54.750> 1.6<00:00:55.020> won't<00:00:56.750> accept<00:00:57.750> very

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
counter-strike 1.6 won't accept very

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.260 
counter-strike 1.6 won't accept very
many<00:00:58.140> colors<00:00:58.530> so<00:00:58.770> your<00:00:59.609> sprays<00:00:59.940> are<00:01:00.090> going<00:01:00.210> to

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
many colors so your sprays are going to

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.180 
many colors so your sprays are going to
look<00:01:00.390> really<00:01:00.660> really<00:01:00.989> weird<00:01:01.199> in

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
look really really weird in

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:03.229 
look really really weird in
counter-strike<00:01:02.579> and<00:01:02.640> they're<00:01:02.789> gonna<00:01:02.879> be<00:01:03.059> like

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
counter-strike and they're gonna be like

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:06.230 
counter-strike and they're gonna be like

00:01:57.999 --> 00:01:58.009 
gonna do a gradient on my spray and I'm

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:00.580 
gonna do a gradient on my spray and I'm
gonna<00:01:58.159> make<00:01:58.429> a<00:01:58.569> that<00:01:59.569> angle<00:01:59.990> and<00:02:00.170> then<00:02:00.350> click

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:00.590

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:02.740 
gonna make a that angle and then click
the<00:02:00.709> gradient<00:02:01.130> and<00:02:01.700> you<00:02:01.819> can<00:02:02.000> change<00:02:02.509> these

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:02.750 
the gradient and you can change these

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:04.630 
the gradient and you can change these
two<00:02:02.990> colors<00:02:03.350> or<00:02:03.530> you<00:02:03.830> can<00:02:03.979> even<00:02:04.100> click<00:02:04.490> on<00:02:04.610> a

light blue and dark blue and I'm gonna
change<00:02:20.269> the<00:02:20.420> angle<00:02:20.920> so<00:02:21.920> it's<00:02:22.100> like<00:02:22.340> that<00:02:24.130> then

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:25.130 
change the angle so it's like that then

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:26.650 
change the angle so it's like that then
scale<00:02:25.549> you<00:02:25.850> can<00:02:26.000> do<00:02:26.090> whatever<00:02:26.239> you<00:02:26.420> want<00:02:26.600> for

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:26.660 
scale you can do whatever you want for

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:29.199 
scale you can do whatever you want for
scale<00:02:27.040> that's<00:02:28.040> like<00:02:28.190> how<00:02:28.340> big<00:02:28.579> the<00:02:28.640> gradient

00:02:29.199 --> 00:02:29.209 
scale that's like how big the gradient

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:30.729 
scale that's like how big the gradient
is<00:02:29.299> in<00:02:29.420> between<00:02:29.720> as<00:02:29.900> you<00:02:29.989> can<00:02:30.079> see<00:02:30.230> it's<00:02:30.440> just<00:02:30.530> a

00:02:30.729 --> 00:02:30.739 
is in between as you can see it's just a

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:33.310 
is in between as you can see it's just a
line<00:02:30.980> right<00:02:31.280> there<00:02:31.549> when<00:02:32.329> it's<00:02:32.480> on<00:02:32.600> the<00:02:32.810> 10%

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:33.320 
line right there when it's on the 10%

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:37.930 
line right there when it's on the 10%
and<00:02:33.739> then<00:02:34.489> 150%<00:02:35.180> it<00:02:36.049> looks<00:02:36.440> pretty<00:02:36.799> nice<00:02:36.980> so

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:37.940 
and then 150% it looks pretty nice so

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:42.360 
and then 150% it looks pretty nice so
I'm<00:02:38.030> actually<00:02:38.120> gonna<00:02:38.390> put<00:02:38.660> mine<00:02:38.840> at<00:02:38.950> 150%<00:02:40.959> okay

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.370 
I'm actually gonna put mine at 150% okay

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:45.280 
I'm actually gonna put mine at 150% okay
and<00:02:43.370> that<00:02:43.549> looks<00:02:43.730> pretty<00:02:43.790> good<00:02:43.970> and<00:02:44.359> now<00:02:44.720> it

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.290 
and that looks pretty good and now it

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:46.569 
and that looks pretty good and now it
has<00:02:45.410> a<00:02:45.440> transparent<00:02:45.739> background<00:02:46.040> what<00:02:46.489> we're
