today I'm just gonna go through a few
quick<00:00:11.219> tips<00:00:11.309> for<00:00:11.790> aligning<00:00:12.000> your<00:00:12.150> driving

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
quick tips for aligning your driving

quick tips for aligning your driving
lights<00:00:12.599> now<00:00:12.990> there's<00:00:13.139> countless<00:00:13.290> ways<00:00:13.590> you

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
lights now there's countless ways you

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:15.200 
lights now there's countless ways you
can<00:00:13.860> go<00:00:13.950> about<00:00:14.040> doing<00:00:14.190> this<00:00:14.549> but<00:00:14.849> we<00:00:14.910> have<00:00:15.030> two

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
can go about doing this but we have two

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:16.580 
can go about doing this but we have two
that<00:00:15.420> seem<00:00:15.570> to<00:00:15.750> have<00:00:15.900> worked<00:00:16.139> well<00:00:16.320> for<00:00:16.350> us

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
that seem to have worked well for us

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.349 
that seem to have worked well for us
method<00:00:17.160> one<00:00:17.340> this<00:00:17.880> one's<00:00:18.090> probably<00:00:18.180> the

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
method one this one's probably the

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:20.120 
method one this one's probably the
simplest<00:00:18.600> one<00:00:18.810> firstly<00:00:19.710> make<00:00:19.859> sure<00:00:19.980> your

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
simplest one firstly make sure your

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.099 
simplest one firstly make sure your
vehicle<00:00:20.279> is<00:00:20.430> parked<00:00:20.640> on<00:00:20.910> a<00:00:21.510> dead<00:00:21.689> level<00:00:21.840> ground

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
vehicle is parked on a dead level ground

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:23.120 
vehicle is parked on a dead level ground
otherwise<00:00:22.320> it's<00:00:22.590> probably<00:00:22.830> think<00:00:22.949> it'll<00:00:23.070> work

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
otherwise it's probably think it'll work

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:24.380 
otherwise it's probably think it'll work
particularly<00:00:23.580> when<00:00:23.820> we<00:00:23.939> try<00:00:24.090> to<00:00:24.150> get<00:00:24.330> the

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
particularly when we try to get the

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.210 
particularly when we try to get the
vertical<00:00:24.779> measurement<00:00:25.170> going<00:00:25.410> grab<00:00:25.890> yourself

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
vertical measurement going grab yourself

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:27.769 
vertical measurement going grab yourself
a<00:00:26.369> straightedge<00:00:26.640> or<00:00:26.970> in<00:00:27.090> this<00:00:27.210> case<00:00:27.390> I've<00:00:27.720> just

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
a straightedge or in this case I've just

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:28.939 
a straightedge or in this case I've just
got<00:00:28.050> a<00:00:28.080> piece<00:00:28.260> of<00:00:28.380> timber<00:00:28.500> from<00:00:28.680> the<00:00:28.740> shed

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
got a piece of timber from the shed

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:30.650 
got a piece of timber from the shed
basically<00:00:29.609> you<00:00:29.670> hold<00:00:29.789> it<00:00:29.939> horizontally<00:00:30.510> to

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
basically you hold it horizontally to

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.389 
basically you hold it horizontally to
the<00:00:30.750> lamps<00:00:31.080> in<00:00:31.230> this<00:00:31.380> case<00:00:31.590> you<00:00:31.740> can<00:00:31.890> see<00:00:32.070> all

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
the lamps in this case you can see all

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:33.799 
the lamps in this case you can see all
that<00:00:32.579> well<00:00:32.820> out<00:00:32.940> of<00:00:32.969> whack<00:00:33.180> so<00:00:33.450> basically<00:00:33.690> you

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
that well out of whack so basically you

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:35.540 
that well out of whack so basically you
just<00:00:33.960> got<00:00:34.079> to<00:00:34.170> line<00:00:34.290> them<00:00:34.440> up<00:00:34.530> and<00:00:34.770> get<00:00:35.280> it<00:00:35.399> so

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
just got to line them up and get it so

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.840 
just got to line them up and get it so
that<00:00:35.670> each<00:00:35.820> of<00:00:36.000> the<00:00:36.570> the<00:00:37.020> corners<00:00:37.380> here

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:37.850 
that each of the the corners here

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:40.369 
that each of the the corners here
perfectly<00:00:38.850> lined<00:00:39.090> up<00:00:39.270> and<00:00:39.510> aligned<00:00:40.079> with<00:00:40.230> one

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
perfectly lined up and aligned with one

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.770 
perfectly lined up and aligned with one
another<00:00:40.640> once<00:00:41.640> you've<00:00:41.790> done<00:00:41.910> that<00:00:41.969> you<00:00:42.660> can

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
another once you've done that you can

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.170 
another once you've done that you can
get<00:00:42.899> rid<00:00:42.989> of<00:00:43.050> that<00:00:43.250> find<00:00:44.250> yourself<00:00:44.610> a<00:00:44.820> level

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
get rid of that find yourself a level

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:46.700 
get rid of that find yourself a level
you<00:00:45.300> hold<00:00:45.539> this<00:00:45.690> one<00:00:45.840> vertically<00:00:46.320> to<00:00:46.440> the<00:00:46.469> lamp

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
you hold this one vertically to the lamp

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.290 
you hold this one vertically to the lamp
and<00:00:46.890> in<00:00:47.219> the<00:00:47.309> case<00:00:47.460> of<00:00:47.640> these<00:00:47.760> lamps<00:00:47.969> they<00:00:48.210> have

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
and in the case of these lamps they have

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.090 
and in the case of these lamps they have
a<00:00:48.329> quick<00:00:48.719> adjustment<00:00:49.140> knob<00:00:49.260> which<00:00:49.469> makes<00:00:49.680> this

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
a quick adjustment knob which makes this

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.430 
a quick adjustment knob which makes this
particularly<00:00:50.610> easy<00:00:50.899> especially<00:00:51.899> when<00:00:52.050> you've

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
particularly easy especially when you've

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:53.240 
particularly easy especially when you've
got<00:00:52.469> a<00:00:52.590> vehicle<00:00:52.770> where<00:00:53.039> you're<00:00:53.160> constantly

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
got a vehicle where you're constantly

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:54.830 
got a vehicle where you're constantly
loading<00:00:53.820> the<00:00:53.910> back<00:00:54.090> where<00:00:54.480> it's<00:00:54.600> going<00:00:54.719> to<00:00:54.780> be

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
loading the back where it's going to be

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.209 
loading the back where it's going to be
dropping<00:00:55.050> and<00:00:55.379> lifting<00:00:55.739> and<00:00:55.890> you<00:00:55.949> always<00:00:56.100> are

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
dropping and lifting and you always are

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:57.470 
dropping and lifting and you always are
going<00:00:56.309> to<00:00:56.399> have<00:00:56.520> to<00:00:56.640> align<00:00:56.820> your<00:00:57.000> lamp<00:00:57.149> you

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
going to have to align your lamp you

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:58.790 
going to have to align your lamp you
just<00:00:57.660> don't<00:00:57.809> do<00:00:57.930> this<00:00:58.140> and<00:00:58.410> you'll<00:00:58.590> line<00:00:58.770> up

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
just don't do this and you'll line up

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.500 
just don't do this and you'll line up
with<00:00:59.070> the<00:00:59.160> bubbles<00:00:59.460> so<00:00:59.969> you've<00:01:00.090> got<00:01:00.210> that<00:01:00.329> one

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
with the bubbles so you've got that one

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.020 
with the bubbles so you've got that one
done<00:01:00.660> do<00:01:01.469> it<00:01:01.590> with<00:01:01.739> the<00:01:01.859> next<00:01:02.039> one<00:01:02.219> finally

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
done do it with the next one finally

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.549 
done do it with the next one finally
just<00:01:03.239> to<00:01:03.329> be<00:01:03.449> sure<00:01:03.480> that<00:01:03.809> you<00:01:03.870> haven't<00:01:04.019> stuffed

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
just to be sure that you haven't stuffed

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.469 
just to be sure that you haven't stuffed
up<00:01:04.710> the<00:01:04.799> horizontal<00:01:05.339> line<00:01:05.549> give<00:01:06.030> it<00:01:06.150> one<00:01:06.330> more

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
up the horizontal line give it one more

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.270 
up the horizontal line give it one more
look<00:01:06.750> in<00:01:07.080> which<00:01:07.260> this<00:01:07.380> case<00:01:07.619> just<00:01:07.950> a<00:01:08.040> little

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
look in which this case just a little

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.719 
look in which this case just a little
bit<00:01:08.430> once<00:01:09.360> that's<00:01:09.479> done<00:01:10.369> tighten<00:01:11.369> it<00:01:11.460> all<00:01:11.549> up

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
bit once that's done tighten it all up

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:17.910 
bit once that's done tighten it all up
and<00:01:11.909> you're<00:01:12.360> as<00:01:12.450> good<00:01:12.479> as<00:01:12.689> gold

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:17.920 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:20.529 

method<00:01:18.920> number<00:01:19.039> two<00:01:19.189> is<00:01:19.850> finding<00:01:20.240> yourself

00:01:20.529 --> 00:01:20.539 
method number two is finding yourself

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:22.690 
method number two is finding yourself
again<00:01:20.869> a<00:01:21.109> level<00:01:21.499> stretch<00:01:21.890> of<00:01:22.009> ground<00:01:22.249> and<00:01:22.460> in

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:22.700 
again a level stretch of ground and in

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:24.760 
again a level stretch of ground and in
this<00:01:22.789> case<00:01:23.030> for<00:01:23.270> me<00:01:23.539> I<00:01:23.780> often<00:01:24.140> do<00:01:24.229> it<00:01:24.319> against<00:01:24.649> a

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:24.770 
this case for me I often do it against a

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:26.559 
this case for me I often do it against a
garage<00:01:25.579> wall<00:01:25.850> basically<00:01:26.240> you<00:01:26.299> just<00:01:26.329> need<00:01:26.539> a

00:01:26.559 --> 00:01:26.569 
garage wall basically you just need a

00:01:26.569 --> 00:01:28.090 
garage wall basically you just need a
wall<00:01:26.840> you<00:01:27.140> need<00:01:27.259> to<00:01:27.350> try<00:01:27.530> and<00:01:27.590> step<00:01:27.770> yourself

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:28.100 
wall you need to try and step yourself

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:30.099 
wall you need to try and step yourself
out<00:01:28.310> about<00:01:28.670> eight<00:01:28.880> meters<00:01:29.060> back<00:01:29.450> measure<00:01:29.840> a

00:01:30.099 --> 00:01:30.109 
out about eight meters back measure a

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:32.859 
out about eight meters back measure a
rough<00:01:30.380> measurement<00:01:30.740> 105<00:01:31.399> in<00:01:31.609> this<00:01:31.729> case<00:01:31.939> you

00:01:32.859 --> 00:01:32.869 
rough measurement 105 in this case you

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:34.599 
rough measurement 105 in this case you
then<00:01:33.049> go<00:01:33.200> to<00:01:33.259> the<00:01:33.409> wall<00:01:33.619> just<00:01:34.250> a<00:01:34.310> piece<00:01:34.490> of

00:01:34.599 --> 00:01:34.609 
then go to the wall just a piece of

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:36.339 
then go to the wall just a piece of
electrical<00:01:34.969> tape<00:01:35.030> from<00:01:35.509> the<00:01:35.600> ground<00:01:35.810> up<00:01:36.020> again

00:01:36.339 --> 00:01:36.349 
electrical tape from the ground up again

00:01:36.349 --> 00:01:38.859 
electrical tape from the ground up again
you<00:01:36.649> measure<00:01:36.890> out<00:01:37.069> the<00:01:37.099> distance<00:01:37.520> 105<00:01:38.000> run<00:01:38.689> a

00:01:38.859 --> 00:01:38.869 
you measure out the distance 105 run a

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:40.870 
you measure out the distance 105 run a
horizontal<00:01:39.560> line<00:01:39.679> all<00:01:39.950> the<00:01:40.159> way<00:01:40.250> across<00:01:40.520> and

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:40.880 
horizontal line all the way across and

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:41.980 
horizontal line all the way across and
to<00:01:41.030> get<00:01:41.149> that<00:01:41.270> extra<00:01:41.539> bit<00:01:41.630> of<00:01:41.689> accuracy

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:41.990 
to get that extra bit of accuracy

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:43.599 
to get that extra bit of accuracy
measure<00:01:42.500> from<00:01:42.709> the<00:01:42.829> center<00:01:42.950> to<00:01:43.159> the<00:01:43.250> center<00:01:43.399> of

00:01:43.599 --> 00:01:43.609 
measure from the center to the center of

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:46.089 
measure from the center to the center of
your<00:01:43.729> driving<00:01:43.939> lamps<00:01:44.179> which<00:01:44.569> is<00:01:44.750> 55<00:01:45.409> go<00:01:45.859> to<00:01:45.920> the

00:01:46.089 --> 00:01:46.099 
your driving lamps which is 55 go to the

00:01:46.099 --> 00:01:47.830 
your driving lamps which is 55 go to the
wall<00:01:46.340> measure<00:01:46.700> the<00:01:46.819> distance<00:01:46.909> there<00:01:47.450> put<00:01:47.810> some

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:47.840 
wall measure the distance there put some

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:49.449 
wall measure the distance there put some
vertical<00:01:48.469> lines<00:01:48.679> going<00:01:48.920> down<00:01:49.069> there

00:01:49.449 --> 00:01:49.459 
vertical lines going down there

00:01:49.459 --> 00:01:50.800 
vertical lines going down there
basically<00:01:49.939> this<00:01:50.030> is<00:01:50.149> best<00:01:50.360> done<00:01:50.479> at<00:01:50.629> nighttime

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:50.810 
basically this is best done at nighttime

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:52.389 
basically this is best done at nighttime
once<00:01:51.379> you've<00:01:51.530> done<00:01:51.649> that<00:01:51.709> flick<00:01:52.099> your<00:01:52.219> lights

00:01:52.389 --> 00:01:52.399 
once you've done that flick your lights

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.779 
once you've done that flick your lights
on

00:01:52.779 --> 00:01:52.789 
on

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:54.429 
on
make<00:01:53.030> sure<00:01:53.209> the<00:01:53.329> vehicles<00:01:53.719> straight<00:01:53.959> on<00:01:54.110> with

00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:54.439 
make sure the vehicles straight on with

00:01:54.439 --> 00:01:55.479 
make sure the vehicles straight on with
the<00:01:54.560> wall<00:01:54.770> to<00:01:54.979> where<00:01:55.159> you've<00:01:55.250> got<00:01:55.369> your

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:55.489 
the wall to where you've got your

00:01:55.489 --> 00:01:57.130 
the wall to where you've got your
markings<00:01:55.879> and<00:01:56.149> with<00:01:56.270> the<00:01:56.360> crosses<00:01:56.719> basically

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:57.140 
markings and with the crosses basically

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:58.690 
markings and with the crosses basically
all<00:01:57.289> you<00:01:57.379> do<00:01:57.530> is<00:01:57.739> you<00:01:57.860> line<00:01:58.039> up<00:01:58.069> the<00:01:58.280> beam<00:01:58.549> of

00:01:58.690 --> 00:01:58.700 
all you do is you line up the beam of

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:00.130 
all you do is you line up the beam of
the<00:01:58.729> lamps<00:01:59.090> and<00:01:59.209> get<00:01:59.390> them<00:01:59.539> spot<00:01:59.840> onto<00:02:00.049> the

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:00.140 
the lamps and get them spot onto the

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:01.300 
the lamps and get them spot onto the
crosses<00:02:00.469> and<00:02:00.679> that'll<00:02:00.890> have<00:02:01.009> your<00:02:01.129> lamp

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:01.310 
crosses and that'll have your lamp

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:03.940 
crosses and that'll have your lamp
aligned<00:02:01.579> as<00:02:01.819> good<00:02:01.969> as<00:02:02.060> gold<00:02:02.590> okay<00:02:03.590> so<00:02:03.649> both<00:02:03.890> of

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:03.950 
aligned as good as gold okay so both of

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:06.219 
aligned as good as gold okay so both of
these<00:02:04.099> methods<00:02:04.520> they<00:02:04.729> may<00:02:04.969> need<00:02:05.450> a<00:02:05.719> little<00:02:06.140> bit

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:06.229 
these methods they may need a little bit

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:07.990 
these methods they may need a little bit
of<00:02:06.319> further<00:02:06.590> adjustment<00:02:07.189> so<00:02:07.340> it's<00:02:07.489> advised<00:02:07.759> it

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:08.000 
of further adjustment so it's advised it

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.339 
of further adjustment so it's advised it
if<00:02:08.179> you<00:02:08.299> can<00:02:08.450> find<00:02:08.629> yourself<00:02:08.750> a<00:02:09.109> straight

00:02:09.339 --> 00:02:09.349 
if you can find yourself a straight

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:10.900 
if you can find yourself a straight
stretch<00:02:09.530> of<00:02:09.709> road<00:02:09.920> one<00:02:10.220> that<00:02:10.369> doesn't<00:02:10.609> see<00:02:10.729> too

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:10.910 
stretch of road one that doesn't see too

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:12.490 
stretch of road one that doesn't see too
much<00:02:11.030> traffic<00:02:11.299> blind<00:02:11.629> yourself<00:02:11.720> up<00:02:12.109> and<00:02:12.290> just

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:12.500 
much traffic blind yourself up and just

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:13.930 
much traffic blind yourself up and just
do<00:02:12.650> a<00:02:12.680> little<00:02:12.920> bit<00:02:13.069> of<00:02:13.099> tweaking<00:02:13.340> to<00:02:13.609> make<00:02:13.760> sure

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:13.940 
do a little bit of tweaking to make sure

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:15.280 
do a little bit of tweaking to make sure
that<00:02:14.090> there<00:02:14.239> shoot<00:02:14.720> in<00:02:14.810> the<00:02:14.870> way<00:02:14.989> you<00:02:15.049> want<00:02:15.200> it

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290 
that there shoot in the way you want it

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:17.080 
that there shoot in the way you want it
to<00:02:15.349> go<00:02:15.530> now<00:02:15.859> in<00:02:16.040> the<00:02:16.160> case<00:02:16.310> of<00:02:16.489> these<00:02:16.640> really

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:17.090 
to go now in the case of these really

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:18.699 
to go now in the case of these really
it's<00:02:17.209> not<00:02:17.329> overly<00:02:17.780> important<00:02:18.319> to<00:02:18.410> get<00:02:18.560> your

00:02:18.699 --> 00:02:18.709 
it's not overly important to get your

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:20.170 
it's not overly important to get your
broad<00:02:19.099> beam<00:02:19.340> because<00:02:19.670> obviously<00:02:19.910> it's

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180 
broad beam because obviously it's

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:21.879 
broad beam because obviously it's
shooting<00:02:20.359> a<00:02:20.599> wide<00:02:21.079> spectrum<00:02:21.470> of<00:02:21.709> light

00:02:21.879 --> 00:02:21.889 
shooting a wide spectrum of light

00:02:21.889 --> 00:02:23.410 
shooting a wide spectrum of light
everywhere<00:02:22.340> so<00:02:22.609> that<00:02:22.910> needed<00:02:23.150> it<00:02:23.239> and<00:02:23.359> I'm

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420 
everywhere so that needed it and I'm
