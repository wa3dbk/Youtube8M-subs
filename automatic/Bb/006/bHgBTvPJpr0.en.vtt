00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
bath I was thinking what should i do

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:00.319 
bath I was thinking what should i do
what<00:00:59.820> should<00:00:59.850> I<00:00:59.969> do

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
what should I do

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.280 
so I thought I would match face - first
because<00:01:02.550> it's<00:01:02.699> my<00:01:02.820> main<00:01:03.000> more<00:01:03.239> patek<00:01:03.539> so<00:01:04.080> why

you<00:01:53.970> can<00:01:54.119> see<00:01:54.299> here<00:01:54.509> you<00:01:54.659> were<00:01:54.810> still<00:01:55.020> using

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
you can see here you were still using

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.429 
you can see here you were still using
the<00:01:55.439> third<00:01:55.860> choice<00:01:56.369> -<00:01:56.729> it's<00:01:56.969> still<00:01:57.119> awesome

00:01:57.429 --> 00:01:57.439 
the third choice - it's still awesome

00:01:57.439 --> 00:01:59.690 
the third choice - it's still awesome
almost<00:01:58.439> I<00:01:58.500> didn't<00:01:58.890> the<00:01:58.950> songs<00:01:59.159> yet<00:01:59.399> because

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
almost I didn't the songs yet because

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.819 
almost I didn't the songs yet because
well<00:01:59.909> this<00:02:00.030> chapters<00:02:00.479> already<00:02:00.899> made<00:02:01.079> before

well this chapters already made before

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:03.679 
well this chapters already made before
the<00:02:01.979> advancement<00:02:02.549> or<00:02:02.759> before<00:02:03.210> the<00:02:03.329> banging

maybe<00:02:03.899> that's<00:02:04.170> why<00:02:04.350> most<00:02:04.770> of<00:02:04.920> the<00:02:05.009> points<00:02:05.759> are

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
maybe that's why most of the points are

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.930 
maybe that's why most of the points are
in<00:02:06.119> strength<00:02:06.509> of<00:02:06.750> course<00:02:07.259> and<00:02:07.590> X<00:02:07.890> and<00:02:08.250> X<00:02:08.489> don't
