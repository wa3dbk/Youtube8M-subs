look<00:02:29.370> at<00:02:29.489> a<00:02:29.519> couple<00:02:29.760> more<00:02:29.940> I<00:02:31.340> thought<00:02:32.340> this<00:02:32.489> one

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
look at a couple more I thought this one

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.310 
look at a couple more I thought this one
was<00:02:32.730> quite<00:02:33.000> clever<00:02:33.239> it's<00:02:33.780> really<00:02:34.049> good<00:02:34.230> in

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:34.320 
was quite clever it's really good in

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:35.720 
was quite clever it's really good in
that<00:02:34.440> yeah<00:02:34.620> because<00:02:34.829> you<00:02:35.070> got<00:02:35.190> the<00:02:35.340> sort<00:02:35.670> of

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
that yeah because you got the sort of

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:38.300 
that yeah because you got the sort of
afterglow<00:02:36.209> of<00:02:36.570> the<00:02:36.780> the<00:02:37.049> red<00:02:37.320> embers<00:02:37.620> of<00:02:38.010> the

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
afterglow of the the red embers of the

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.160 
afterglow of the the red embers of the
matchsticks<00:02:38.910> am<00:02:39.239> I<00:02:39.390> still<00:02:39.630> a<00:02:39.690> more<00:02:39.870> thoughtful

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
matchsticks am I still a more thoughtful

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:42.530 
matchsticks am I still a more thoughtful
and<00:02:40.620> just<00:02:40.769> the<00:02:40.980> frames<00:02:41.310> yeah<00:02:41.850> yeah<00:02:42.209> a<00:02:42.239> little

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
and just the frames yeah yeah a little

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:45.559 
and just the frames yeah yeah a little
bit<00:02:42.630> more<00:02:42.840> clever<00:02:43.170> and<00:02:43.530> that<00:02:43.560> was<00:02:44.400> that<00:02:45.300> was<00:02:45.390> by

00:02:45.559 --> 00:02:45.569 
bit more clever and that was that was by

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:49.150 
bit more clever and that was that was by
Daniel<00:02:46.080> ball<00:02:46.410> well<00:02:46.860> done<00:02:47.069> Hugh<00:02:47.400> Daniel<00:02:47.879> and

then
this<00:02:51.870> was<00:02:52.080> quite<00:02:52.230> an<00:02:52.380> interesting<00:02:52.530> one

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 
this was quite an interesting one

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:54.300 
there's a little bit unusual because

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:57.200 
there's a little bit unusual because
it's<00:02:55.140> like<00:02:55.320> a<00:02:55.350> hot<00:02:55.650> car<00:02:56.040> and<00:02:56.070> this<00:02:56.580> girl<00:02:56.910> and

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:55.800 
glass all goes in keeping that was by

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:59.660 
glass all goes in keeping that was by
Andrzej<00:03:56.870> odder<00:03:57.870> Matt<00:03:58.440> I<00:03:58.620> think<00:03:58.890> it<00:03:59.070> was<00:03:59.250> from

00:03:59.660 --> 00:03:59.670 
Andrzej odder Matt I think it was from

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:07.050 
have a look at what else have we got

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:09.590 
have a look at what else have we got
oh<00:04:07.140> yeah<00:04:07.320> this<00:04:07.500> corn-on-the-cob<00:04:08.340> image<00:04:09.060> that

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:09.600 
oh yeah this corn-on-the-cob image that

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:11.060 
oh yeah this corn-on-the-cob image that
was<00:04:09.750> quite<00:04:09.930> clever<00:04:10.260> because<00:04:10.680> you<00:04:10.860> got<00:04:10.980> the

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:11.070 
was quite clever because you got the

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:14.870 
was quite clever because you got the
melting<00:04:11.670> yeah<00:04:11.850> the<00:04:12.330> melting<00:04:12.930> butter<00:04:13.400> now<00:04:14.400> if<00:04:14.760> I

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:14.880 
melting yeah the melting butter now if I

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:16.580 
melting yeah the melting butter now if I
got<00:04:15.030> that<00:04:15.150> widely<00:04:15.510> textures<00:04:16.080> now<00:04:16.290> isn't<00:04:16.500> it

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:16.590 
got that widely textures now isn't it

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:18.050 
got that widely textures now isn't it
that<00:04:16.859> might<00:04:17.130> have<00:04:17.310> been<00:04:17.430> Daniel<00:04:17.700> bought

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:18.060 
that might have been Daniel bought

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:19.460 
that might have been Daniel bought
rather<00:04:18.600> than<00:04:18.780> the<00:04:18.840> other<00:04:18.959> one<00:04:19.080> I<00:04:19.169> don't<00:04:19.230> know<00:04:19.440> I

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:19.470 
rather than the other one I don't know I

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:20.420 
rather than the other one I don't know I
don't<00:04:19.590> know<00:04:19.770> he<00:04:19.890> took<00:04:20.100> it

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:20.430 
don't know he took it
