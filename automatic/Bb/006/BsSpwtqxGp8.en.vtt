00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:04.540
 welcome to game life here I bring you 

00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:08.620
 another video guys and this time we're in 

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:10.300
 multiplayer of halo 4 this time is not what 

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:11.980
 that we usually play what I have brought more 

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:14.620
 to the channel that is infinity murderer this 

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:16.209
 once is a game of regicide a way 

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:20.320
 whom I have been fond of a little while ago 

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:21.880
 because there was a weekly challenge a 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:24.460
 weekly challenge of war games 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:26.560
 in which you had to get 80 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:28.060
 requisitios that is to kill the king in these 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:32.169
 Regicide games if someone does not know 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:34.690
 how is the king is good the king is who 

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:37.469
 takes more score of the game already me 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:39.609
 you have given me several interesting shots 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:41.769
 good the one that takes more score of the 

00:00:39.609 --> 00:00:42.399
 regicide games is what is the 

00:00:41.769 --> 00:00:44.799
 king 

00:00:42.399 --> 00:00:48.190
 leave marquitas on the map to know 

00:00:44.799 --> 00:00:50.409
 where it is at the moment we do not see any 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:52.329
 Mark now you will see it because nobody will 

00:00:50.409 --> 00:00:53.769
 killed nobody but the one that 

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:56.469
 score carries as I tell you is the king 

00:00:53.769 --> 00:00:59.049
 and we have special bonuses for 

00:00:56.469 --> 00:01:01.390
 kill him if he kills a lot for example 

00:00:59.049 --> 00:01:04.930
 good good good good 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:06.520
 fatal good we keep guys and the 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:08.229
 marquita del rey good help with the 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:10.060
 reviewer just charged the king has 

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:12.100
 reappeared out there 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:13.750
 the more the king kills the one who carries more 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:15.520
 score the reward increasing 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:18.509
 Right now, as you can see, he has 20 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:21.640
 reward I will try to kill him 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:25.110
 yes sir regicide well is perfect no 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:28.630
 no no no no no no no no no no 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:30.909
 I do not know how I do not know how I had 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:32.440
 come out that and this that taking advantage of 

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:36.039
 shield down there is has reappeared 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:39.250
 just and perfect good as I tell you and the 

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:41.890
 truth is that it is a way that is 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:43.330
 surprising the truth is that it is at 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:45.970
 least I thought it was a bit 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:48.250
 addictive and maybe he has a little 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:50.950
 more action than team duels 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:52.750
 as they are a murderer by infinity yes that 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:54.280
 I'm liking a little bit more is 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:55.920
 pretty funny how is it all against 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:58.660
 all because the truth is that they would be 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:01.760
 incredible here I have one marked 

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:04.430
 out there it's worth I have I go there 

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:06.860
 and as I say the challenges, I'm going 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:09.380
 looking from time to time good perfect 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:11.680
 great they are not giving me all 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:11.680
 sides 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:18.880
 escapes the king bonus of 35 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:21.580
 I have to load melo already 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:23.770
 as I say I'm playing quite 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:25.660
 regicide for that challenge always 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:28.090
 I try to emphasize that the 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:29.560
 challenges at least to level up 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:31.390
 to climb the experience of truth 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:32.710
 that are very good so yes that 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:35.110
 I would recommend that you take a look at 

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:37.930
 once in a while to the good there good 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:40.270
 great there are challenges to the best that are 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:42.100
 daily war games diaries 

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:44.380
 even monthly there are some like me 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:47.600
 that one had to earn certain hundred 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:49.730
 I do not know how many games the monthly 

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:52.130
 so I was trying to get 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:56.090
 good a record that good with the 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:57.260
 granada equal I am the king yes sir as 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:59.240
 I mean, I was trying to get that 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:02.360
 weekly challenge that I think gives 

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:04.160
 quite experience and total we do not take long 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:06.320
 nothing in getting 80 regicide is 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:08.510
 throwing several games we are killing the 

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:10.690
 good king in a week not in the temple 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:12.560
 to get it 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:14.300
 well they are giving me for all 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:16.820
 endorsements that I am the king I have to have 

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:18.680
 more careful is no longer the king and if 

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:20.210
 you see guys you can see the 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:22.070
 difference of score that I have 

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:25.070
 with which is the king I have 115 for 

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:27.560
 example now and the 130 and has a 

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:30.020
 reward of 20 so I charge it and 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:32.610
 I am the king yes sir no no no no no me 

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:34.620
 they are coming here all 

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:38.730
 I believe that at least in these modes of 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:40.500
 game that is the king never gets bored 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:42.570
 because because how is the marquita and 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:44.990
 everybody comes for you because the 

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:47.460
 truth is that they would be incredible 

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:50.130
 look here as they come to me they are all 

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:51.440
 shooting from afar even good no 

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:54.290
 I know if 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:55.730
 today I do not know how to do it right when I'm 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:57.650
 the king the truth I do not have so much 

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:59.600
 experience in this game mode but 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:01.010
 yes it's funny I've been called a lot 

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:03.080
 I recommend that if you have not 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:04.910
 played good we killed each other at the same time 

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:08.180
 incredible I love these things from 

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:09.530
 gelu 42 the deaths to the bird the shots to 

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:12.100
 head at the same time that kind of thing 

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:12.100
 it's very good 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:17.530
 if you do not open what I said if you have not 

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:18.699
 tried regicide I would recommend that you 

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:21.160
 you try because the truth that is very 

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:23.979
 well as you see, there is practically no 

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:26.530
 a second that is if we go without being 

00:04:23.979 --> 00:04:28.840
 shooting standing is here pretty 

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:30.550
 impossible and less being the king as 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:33.190
 I am now good I am watching very released 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:34.460
 until then good the good grenade good 

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:36.830
 good 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:39.669
 so I've caught sight I promise that 

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:39.669
 it's one thing that I like 

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:47.389
 I have taken the promised view because 

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:48.710
 example when I'm the king yes that is 

00:04:47.389 --> 00:04:50.419
 quite interesting to see through 

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:52.009
 the walls to defend yourself from the people 

00:04:50.419 --> 00:04:54.080
 that comes for you because the truth is 

00:04:52.009 --> 00:04:55.759
 what is good good good is good 

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:57.680
 complicated because in addition if you kill one 

00:04:55.759 --> 00:04:59.599
 Well, it usually comes back, you have those 

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:02.479
 marquitas as I tell you that they come out in all 

00:04:59.599 --> 00:05:03.919
 the good map has stuck on yes sir 

00:05:02.479 --> 00:05:05.270
 to see my shield comes more people come 

00:05:03.919 --> 00:05:07.970
 good good good good good 

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:10.550
 good good good and he starts to kill him 

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:14.509
 A has killed him double death 

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:15.800
 Fortunately for great slaughter that 

00:05:14.509 --> 00:05:17.900
 uncle has set out to murder the other 

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:22.220
 because if he had not died 

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:26.449
 very good they have in mind or not or what 

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:29.870
 You say, I have not seen them, my mother. How bad 

00:05:26.449 --> 00:05:32.720
 good luck I'm still the king if I'm 

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:35.030
 ten points away from the one who follows me like that 

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:38.240
 that we are going well I will see where we are going 

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:40.780
 around here for example how they see the mission 

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:44.100
 good good that shot has given me 

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:47.040
 one that was on the roof 

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:49.889
 As you can see people are usually grouped in 

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:51.930
 areas of the map and it's quite complicated 

00:05:49.889 --> 00:05:53.490
 good good and the regime is out there 

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:55.469
 removed what from the king 

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:56.999
 when we are in zones so there are 

00:05:55.469 --> 00:05:59.719
 pretty people grouped the truth is that 

00:05:56.999 --> 00:06:04.289
 it's quite complicated to get out alive 

00:05:59.719 --> 00:06:06.870
 worth a downcast of 15 points and a help 

00:06:04.289 --> 00:06:09.379
 with the king and good good good good 

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:09.379
 good good good 

00:06:09.689 --> 00:06:14.430
 a rocket launcher see for small fields 

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:17.520
 you have to try regicide I think 

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:19.289
 as you see a lot of action we are going to 

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:20.400
 see how we can finish this game 

00:06:19.289 --> 00:06:21.930
 so I recommend you have a lot 

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:24.150
 be careful when you are the drei yo 

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:26.280
 Now I'm not, I'm 30 

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:28.290
 points of the king 

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:31.020
 and it's going to be quite complicated to go back to 

00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:32.400
 be king but now we see it either 

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:33.960
 it seems that the king kills a lot has a 

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:37.740
 bonus of 25 so I'll go to 

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:39.389
 for him I can not killed him good good 

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:42.800
 Well, I removed all the shield, I think 

00:06:39.389 --> 00:06:45.450
 yes he received day 5 to 5 of that king 

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:48.080
 Good, good, I get on, I get on, they kill me 

00:06:45.450 --> 00:06:53.120
 where they kill 

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:56.009
 from behind good good people there are three or 

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:57.930
 four one shooting from far away good 

00:06:56.009 --> 00:07:00.119
 I have to kill the king whatever it is guys 

00:06:57.930 --> 00:07:01.469
 good good good good good if you 

00:07:00.119 --> 00:07:03.659
 pay the state 

00:07:01.469 --> 00:07:06.029
 God has an advantage of 30 very 

00:07:03.659 --> 00:07:08.099
 important always go to or at least 

00:07:06.029 --> 00:07:09.930
 try to kill the king and always good 

00:07:08.099 --> 00:07:11.580
 Here they already sting me but I've taken 

00:07:09.930 --> 00:07:14.309
 the bonus of this already five points 

00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:16.199
 of winning guys is 300 points 

00:07:14.309 --> 00:07:17.849
 I'm going to go super fast to give up a help 

00:07:16.199 --> 00:07:19.370
 to whatever I do not know where there are people worth 

00:07:17.849 --> 00:07:21.410
 there's one there 

00:07:19.370 --> 00:07:24.680
 try to catch him I have not been given 

00:07:21.410 --> 00:07:26.810
 nothing good good the one that follows me only 

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:28.550
 he took 10 points could he win if I 

00:07:26.810 --> 00:07:30.620
 kill me right now for example good 

00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:32.600
 good good good good good things 

00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:35.780

00:07:35.780 --> 00:07:40.520
 good has gone well good good good 

00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:43.010
 I won but for very little guys 

00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:44.720
 see how I was following the 

00:07:43.010 --> 00:07:47.930
 heels this guy who was called 

00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:49.370
 madness or something like that and what else to say 

00:07:47.930 --> 00:07:50.780
 Well, nothing, guys, the truth is that 

00:07:49.370 --> 00:07:53.090
 departure I liked it, I hope 

00:07:50.780 --> 00:07:55.400
 that if you do not play this kind of 

00:07:53.090 --> 00:07:57.979
 Regicide mode , try it 

00:07:55.400 --> 00:08:01.250
