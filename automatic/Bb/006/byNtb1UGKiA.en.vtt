00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
based on fantasy league so we can start

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:30.500

the top assist or top goalscorer and

the top assist or top goalscorer and

again<00:04:56.610> they<00:04:56.699> don't<00:04:56.909> have<00:04:57.060> benches<00:04:57.449> so<00:04:57.840> imagine

00:04:58.070 --> 00:04:58.080 
again they don't have benches so imagine

00:04:58.080 --> 00:04:59.600 
again they don't have benches so imagine
most<00:04:58.349> of<00:04:58.439> the<00:04:58.560> PFA<00:04:58.860> wants<00:04:59.069> to<00:04:59.159> miss<00:04:59.310> that<00:04:59.460> will

00:04:59.600 --> 00:04:59.610 
most of the PFA wants to miss that will

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:01.100 
most of the PFA wants to miss that will
probably<00:04:59.849> get<00:04:59.939> into<00:05:00.090> this<00:05:00.240> one<00:05:00.449> and<00:05:00.750> the<00:05:00.930> likes

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:01.110 
probably get into this one and the likes

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:02.809 
probably get into this one and the likes
