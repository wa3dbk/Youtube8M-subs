the<00:04:01.750> reason<00:04:02.349> this<00:04:02.500> is<00:04:02.680> is<00:04:03.129> because<00:04:03.389> how<00:04:04.389> you're

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:04.540 
the reason this is is because how you're

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:06.750 
the reason this is is because how you're
going<00:04:04.629> to<00:04:04.690> get<00:04:04.840> back<00:04:05.049> well<00:04:05.859> one<00:04:06.370> thing's<00:04:06.639> for

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:06.760 
going to get back well one thing's for

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:08.219 
going to get back well one thing's for
sure<00:04:06.940> and<00:04:07.299> I<00:04:07.329> don't<00:04:07.599> have<00:04:07.780> enough<00:04:07.959> ender

00:04:08.219 --> 00:04:08.229 
sure and I don't have enough ender

00:04:08.229 --> 00:04:10.050 
sure and I don't have enough ender
pearls<00:04:08.440> to<00:04:08.620> demonstrate<00:04:09.159> this<00:04:09.250> you<00:04:09.819> can't

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:10.060 
pearls to demonstrate this you can't

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:11.490 
pearls to demonstrate this you can't
just

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:11.500 
just

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:14.380 
just
why<00:04:12.500> you<00:04:12.920> can't<00:04:13.129> just<00:04:13.370> shoot<00:04:13.879> your<00:04:14.030> way<00:04:14.180> back

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:14.390 
why you can't just shoot your way back

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:17.170 
why you can't just shoot your way back
in<00:04:14.659> to<00:04:15.079> teleporting<00:04:15.680> doesn't<00:04:16.549> work<00:04:16.699> it's<00:04:17.090> a

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:17.180 
in to teleporting doesn't work it's a

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:20.199 
in to teleporting doesn't work it's a
one-way<00:04:17.690> thing<00:04:18.310> maybe<00:04:19.310> there<00:04:19.549> is<00:04:19.669> a<00:04:19.699> technique

00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:20.209 
one-way thing maybe there is a technique

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:22.360 
one-way thing maybe there is a technique
you<00:04:20.389> can<00:04:20.600> teleport<00:04:21.049> your<00:04:21.350> way<00:04:21.500> because<00:04:21.799> you

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:22.370 
you can teleport your way because you

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:24.219 
you can teleport your way because you
can<00:04:22.550> get<00:04:22.759> here<00:04:23.000> you<00:04:23.389> could<00:04:23.539> probably<00:04:23.720> get<00:04:24.050> back

00:04:24.219 --> 00:04:24.229 
can get here you could probably get back

00:04:24.229 --> 00:04:27.279 
can get here you could probably get back
but<00:04:25.100> the<00:04:25.639> easiest<00:04:26.030> way<00:04:26.180> is<00:04:26.300> to<00:04:26.479> make<00:04:26.750> a<00:04:26.780> portal

00:04:27.279 --> 00:04:27.289 
but the easiest way is to make a portal

00:04:27.289 --> 00:04:29.830 
but the easiest way is to make a portal
and<00:04:27.440> to<00:04:28.160> make<00:04:28.340> this<00:04:28.520> portal<00:04:29.000> close<00:04:29.300> enough<00:04:29.600> to

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:29.840 
and to make this portal close enough to

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:33.129 
and to make this portal close enough to
your<00:04:29.960> old<00:04:30.259> portal<00:04:30.770> down<00:04:31.070> stairs<00:04:31.880> the<00:04:32.840> reason

00:04:33.129 --> 00:04:33.139 
your old portal down stairs the reason

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:35.290 
your old portal down stairs the reason
why<00:04:33.259> is<00:04:33.320> you<00:04:33.560> do<00:04:33.710> not<00:04:33.919> want<00:04:33.979> people<00:04:34.310> making<00:04:34.970> a

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:35.300 
why is you do not want people making a

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:39.550 
why is you do not want people making a
portal<00:04:35.750> that<00:04:36.620> could<00:04:36.889> come<00:04:37.160> here<00:04:37.810> yes<00:04:38.810> so<00:04:39.350> if

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:39.560 
portal that could come here yes so if

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:41.529 
portal that could come here yes so if
you're<00:04:39.710> on<00:04:39.830> a<00:04:39.860> multiplayer<00:04:40.400> server<00:04:40.460> they<00:04:41.360> know

00:04:41.529 --> 00:04:41.539 
you're on a multiplayer server they know

00:04:41.539 --> 00:04:43.510 
you're on a multiplayer server they know
you<00:04:41.600> have<00:04:41.780> a<00:04:41.840> portal<00:04:42.229> up<00:04:42.380> here<00:04:42.650> so<00:04:43.130> they<00:04:43.310> make

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:43.520 
you have a portal up here so they make

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:46.480 
you have a portal up here so they make
their<00:04:43.729> own<00:04:43.940> and<00:04:44.440> teleport<00:04:45.440> here<00:04:45.800> and<00:04:46.039> they

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:46.490 
their own and teleport here and they

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:48.580 
their own and teleport here and they
walk<00:04:46.820> out<00:04:47.000> of<00:04:47.120> your<00:04:47.240> portal<00:04:47.630> to<00:04:47.810> loot<00:04:48.440> your

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:48.590 
walk out of your portal to loot your

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:52.420 
walk out of your portal to loot your
stuff<00:04:48.919> no<00:04:49.849> that's<00:04:50.780> not<00:04:51.020> very<00:04:51.050> cool<00:04:51.440> or<00:04:51.710> fun<00:04:52.220> is

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:52.430 
stuff no that's not very cool or fun is

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:56.499 
stuff no that's not very cool or fun is
it<00:04:52.820> so<00:04:53.660> basically<00:04:53.930> how<00:04:54.470> it<00:04:54.620> works<00:04:54.650> is<00:04:55.479> you<00:04:56.479> just

00:04:56.499 --> 00:04:56.509 
it so basically how it works is you just

00:04:56.509 --> 00:04:58.390 
it so basically how it works is you just
have<00:04:56.810> to<00:04:56.960> have<00:04:57.080> an<00:04:57.199> old<00:04:57.380> portal<00:04:57.919> underneath

00:04:58.390 --> 00:04:58.400 
have to have an old portal underneath

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:02.439 
have to have an old portal underneath
now<00:04:59.300> you're<00:04:59.960> like<00:05:00.139> okay<00:05:00.590> my<00:05:00.949> mind's<00:05:01.490> destroyed

00:05:02.439 --> 00:05:02.449 
now you're like okay my mind's destroyed

00:05:02.449 --> 00:05:05.650 
now you're like okay my mind's destroyed
why<00:05:02.870> why<00:05:03.770> is<00:05:04.280> can't<00:05:04.849> why<00:05:04.940> can<00:05:05.180> you<00:05:05.270> build<00:05:05.419> up

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:05.660 
why why is can't why can you build up

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:07.150 
why why is can't why can you build up
here<00:05:05.870> why<00:05:05.990> doesn't<00:05:06.410> it<00:05:06.440> prevent<00:05:07.009> you<00:05:07.130> from

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:07.160 
here why doesn't it prevent you from

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:10.650 
here why doesn't it prevent you from
building<00:05:07.789> like<00:05:08.330> the<00:05:08.479> overworld<00:05:08.930> does<00:05:09.310> well

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:10.660 
building like the overworld does well

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:13.629 
building like the overworld does well
simply<00:05:11.660> put<00:05:11.900> the<00:05:12.110> overworld<00:05:12.560> used<00:05:13.070> to<00:05:13.340> stop

00:05:13.629 --> 00:05:13.639 
simply put the overworld used to stop

00:05:13.639 --> 00:05:16.480 
simply put the overworld used to stop
you<00:05:13.940> from<00:05:14.150> building<00:05:14.599> in<00:05:15.380> fact<00:05:15.650> right<00:05:16.460> now

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:16.490 
you from building in fact right now

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:19.300 
you from building in fact right now
we're<00:05:16.970> above<00:05:17.330> the<00:05:17.570> old<00:05:17.780> cap<00:05:18.110> limit<00:05:18.560> we're<00:05:19.250> at

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:19.310 
we're above the old cap limit we're at

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:26.950 
we're above the old cap limit we're at
128<00:05:20.240> the<00:05:20.930> cap<00:05:21.229> limit<00:05:21.710> ends<00:05:24.699> what<00:05:25.699> Oh<00:05:26.000> the<00:05:26.690> cap

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:26.960 
128 the cap limit ends what Oh the cap

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:31.300 
128 the cap limit ends what Oh the cap
limit<00:05:27.409> ends<00:05:27.860> at<00:05:28.330> 127<00:05:29.330> I<00:05:29.570> believe<00:05:29.870> or<00:05:30.110> a<00:05:30.949> little

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:31.310 
limit ends at 127 I believe or a little

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:33.460 
limit ends at 127 I believe or a little
bit<00:05:31.460> down<00:05:31.669> here<00:05:31.940> but<00:05:32.240> you're<00:05:32.659> supposed<00:05:32.900> to<00:05:33.260> not

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:33.470 
bit down here but you're supposed to not

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:35.980 
bit down here but you're supposed to not
be<00:05:33.500> able<00:05:33.800> to<00:05:33.949> build<00:05:34.159> up<00:05:34.340> here<00:05:34.639> well<00:05:35.270> I<00:05:35.300> am<00:05:35.630> and

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:35.990 
be able to build up here well I am and

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:39.460 
be able to build up here well I am and
here's<00:05:36.320> why<00:05:36.590> back<00:05:37.520> then<00:05:37.880> in<00:05:38.180> the<00:05:39.050> game<00:05:39.229> you

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:39.470 
here's why back then in the game you

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:41.200 
here's why back then in the game you
weren't<00:05:39.650> supposed<00:05:39.860> to<00:05:39.919> build<00:05:40.130> up<00:05:40.280> here<00:05:40.550> but

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:41.210 
weren't supposed to build up here but

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:45.100 
weren't supposed to build up here but
now<00:05:41.449> you<00:05:41.509> can<00:05:42.020> ever<00:05:42.409> since<00:05:42.889> the<00:05:43.070> update<00:05:43.280> of<00:05:44.110> 1.1

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:45.110 
now you can ever since the update of 1.1

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:49.570 
now you can ever since the update of 1.1
I<00:05:45.349> believe<00:05:45.770> or<00:05:46.070> 1.2<00:05:46.970> they<00:05:47.690> implemented<00:05:48.650> double

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:49.580 
I believe or 1.2 they implemented double

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:51.999 
I believe or 1.2 they implemented double
the<00:05:49.880> height<00:05:50.060> in<00:05:50.360> Minecraft<00:05:51.139> where<00:05:51.740> you<00:05:51.830> could

00:05:51.999 --> 00:05:52.009 
the height in Minecraft where you could

00:05:52.009 --> 00:05:54.550 
the height in Minecraft where you could
build<00:05:52.130> two<00:05:52.490> times<00:05:52.789> higher<00:05:53.120> well<00:05:53.990> that

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:54.560 
build two times higher well that

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:57.999 
build two times higher well that
explains<00:05:55.070> it<00:05:55.340> you<00:05:55.789> can<00:05:55.970> build<00:05:56.620> 128<00:05:57.620> more

00:05:57.999 --> 00:05:58.009 
explains it you can build 128 more

00:05:58.009 --> 00:06:01.390 
explains it you can build 128 more
blocks<00:05:58.400> on<00:05:58.729> top<00:05:59.090> of<00:05:59.300> the<00:05:59.419> nether<00:05:59.680> but<00:06:00.680> you

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:01.400 
blocks on top of the nether but you

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:03.879 
blocks on top of the nether but you
can't<00:06:01.669> access<00:06:02.180> this<00:06:02.720> without<00:06:03.139> ender<00:06:03.590> pearls

00:06:03.879 --> 00:06:03.889 
can't access this without ender pearls

00:06:03.889 --> 00:06:07.029 
can't access this without ender pearls
so<00:06:04.639> well<00:06:05.419> you've<00:06:05.900> got<00:06:06.110> a<00:06:06.139> base<00:06:06.409> you<00:06:06.650> can<00:06:06.800> build

00:06:07.029 --> 00:06:07.039 
so well you've got a base you can build

00:06:07.039 --> 00:06:09.249 
so well you've got a base you can build
as<00:06:07.250> high<00:06:07.639> as<00:06:07.699> you<00:06:08.030> want<00:06:08.060> you<00:06:08.810> can<00:06:08.930> even<00:06:09.080> build

00:06:09.249 --> 00:06:09.259 
as high as you want you can even build

00:06:09.259 --> 00:06:11.290 
as high as you want you can even build
it<00:06:09.470> floating<00:06:09.979> so<00:06:10.220> people<00:06:10.580> who<00:06:10.699> get<00:06:10.909> up<00:06:11.030> here

00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:11.300 
it floating so people who get up here

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:13.420 
it floating so people who get up here
they<00:06:11.509> don't<00:06:11.630> see<00:06:11.990> it<00:06:12.110> or<00:06:12.289> you<00:06:12.320> know<00:06:13.070> whatever

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:13.430 
they don't see it or you know whatever

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:16.300 
they don't see it or you know whatever
you<00:06:13.699> whatever<00:06:14.030> you<00:06:14.360> do<00:06:15.009> but<00:06:16.009> it's<00:06:16.190> the

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:16.310 
you whatever you do but it's the

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:18.730 
you whatever you do but it's the
absolute<00:06:16.940> most<00:06:17.240> hidden<00:06:17.750> base<00:06:17.960> in<00:06:18.199> Minecraft

00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:18.740 
absolute most hidden base in Minecraft

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:21.100 
absolute most hidden base in Minecraft
now<00:06:19.070> I<00:06:19.639> don't<00:06:19.789> want<00:06:20.029> to<00:06:20.090> ramble<00:06:20.479> on<00:06:20.539> too<00:06:20.779> long

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:21.110 
now I don't want to ramble on too long

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:23.680 
now I don't want to ramble on too long
but<00:06:21.500> as<00:06:21.740> you<00:06:22.010> could<00:06:22.099> get<00:06:22.340> the<00:06:22.820> concept<00:06:23.450> is

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:23.690 
but as you could get the concept is

00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:24.940 
but as you could get the concept is
really<00:06:23.779> basic

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:24.950 
really basic

00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:27.580 
really basic
enderpearl<00:06:25.400> you're<00:06:25.970> way<00:06:26.120> up<00:06:26.150> here<00:06:26.540> make<00:06:27.410> sure

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:27.590 
enderpearl you're way up here make sure

00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:30.600 
enderpearl you're way up here make sure
that<00:06:27.710> you<00:06:27.830> find<00:06:28.160> the<00:06:28.370> highest<00:06:28.730> a<00:06:29.230> bedrock

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:30.610 
that you find the highest a bedrock

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:33.820 
that you find the highest a bedrock
piece<00:06:31.610> because<00:06:32.120> you<00:06:32.270> can't<00:06:32.480> just<00:06:32.780> do<00:06:32.960> it<00:06:33.110> at

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:33.830 
piece because you can't just do it at

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:35.950 
piece because you can't just do it at
the<00:06:34.280> second-highest<00:06:35.060> you<00:06:35.180> have<00:06:35.300> to<00:06:35.390> find<00:06:35.630> them

00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:35.960 
the second-highest you have to find them

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:38.200 
the second-highest you have to find them
utmost<00:06:36.160> bedrock<00:06:37.160> piece<00:06:37.460> if<00:06:37.670> that<00:06:37.850> makes<00:06:38.090> any

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:38.210 
utmost bedrock piece if that makes any

00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:41.650 
utmost bedrock piece if that makes any
sense<00:06:38.360> and<00:06:39.190> here<00:06:40.190> let's<00:06:40.430> see<00:06:40.580> what<00:06:40.700> else<00:06:40.910> this

00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:41.660 
sense and here let's see what else this

00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:43.870 
sense and here let's see what else this
is<00:06:41.720> great<00:06:42.170> for<00:06:42.440> the<00:06:42.530> faction<00:06:43.130> plugin<00:06:43.580> because

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:43.880 
is great for the faction plugin because

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:46.630 
is great for the faction plugin because
you<00:06:44.030> can<00:06:44.180> claim<00:06:44.510> land<00:06:44.870> so<00:06:45.830> I<00:06:45.860> would<00:06:46.340> come<00:06:46.490> in

00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:46.640 
you can claim land so I would come in

00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:48.490 
you can claim land so I would come in
here<00:06:46.850> and<00:06:46.940> I<00:06:47.030> would<00:06:47.090> claim<00:06:47.450> this<00:06:47.660> entire<00:06:48.140> Shack

00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:48.500 
here and I would claim this entire Shack

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:52.270 
here and I would claim this entire Shack
and<00:06:50.200> hopefully<00:06:51.200> won't<00:06:51.440> get<00:06:51.590> found<00:06:51.890> and

00:06:52.270 --> 00:06:52.280 
and hopefully won't get found and

00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:54.490 
and hopefully won't get found and
claimed<00:06:52.940> by<00:06:53.180> somebody<00:06:53.450> else<00:06:53.780> but<00:06:54.080> anybody

00:06:54.490 --> 00:06:54.500 
claimed by somebody else but anybody

00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:57.070 
claimed by somebody else but anybody
else<00:06:54.710> who<00:06:55.070> just<00:06:55.100> finds<00:06:55.910> it<00:06:56.060> they<00:06:56.690> probably

00:06:57.070 --> 00:06:57.080 
else who just finds it they probably

00:06:57.080 --> 00:06:59.500 
else who just finds it they probably
can't<00:06:57.470> claim<00:06:57.710> it<00:06:57.770> so<00:06:58.190> that's<00:06:58.760> just<00:06:59.000> for<00:06:59.120> extra

00:06:59.500 --> 00:06:59.510 
can't claim it so that's just for extra
