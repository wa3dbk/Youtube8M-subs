00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:05.600
 greetings guys, I saw very well today 

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:08.029
 we will see the slams the islands are 

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:09.980
 basically climate for vehicles but I've 

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:13.250
 seen that in many maps people do not 

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:15.259
 know how they work do not get confused 

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:17.539
 they are like the anti-tank mines that arrive 

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:20.119
 you put them on the ground and that your enemy 

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:22.580
 then see the mock tips 

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:25.490
 they exploit these devices are put 

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:28.039
 vertically on walls in trees in 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:30.920
 rocks what you want only not 

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:33.350
 put it on the floor please have a 

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:35.690
 radius of action of 10 meters on average 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:36.530
 at 11 meters it will not cause any 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:38.630
 hurt 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:40.910
 the enemy on will hear the explosion 

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:43.640
 and each time it will cause damage in 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:46.410
 average 35 points whether the vehicles 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:48.970
 that have armor 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:51.280
 have active protection 

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:53.080
 that is, in hanging as an earring a 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:55.720
 his grandmother's tooth blessed by the 

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:58.630
 Dad for good luck always 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:01:00.790
 will always have the same damage so 

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:02.380
 takes advantage of the situation by putting slam 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:04.900
 where you see your enemies pass 

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:07.180
 try to put us a little at the level of 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:09.070
 floor so they do not look much or under 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:11.740
 of the bridges you will see that they cause a 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:14.350
 irremediable fury in your enemy now 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:16.300
 as a bonus if you want to leave a surprise 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:19.480
 magical musical comic to your enemy 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:21.310
 about your vehicle and for 3-6 the cndh 

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:23.350
 get away running like I did when I told 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:26.050
 your mother who did not want to eat the soup and 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:28.180
 wait patiently your enemy will be 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:30.760
 dead without you having done anything else 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:32.410
 and what happens is that now the slam has 

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:34.509
 error if the surface 

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:36.940
 move the slam will explode causing your 

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:39.250
 maximum damage the tank your enemy will feel 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:41.619
 little by little the blow of each of the 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:43.810
 slam will feel like a direct hit from 

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:46.150
 another tank and how can you not stop 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:49.690
 move is simply detonate to the 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:51.670
 2 other slam remaining now is not good 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:54.220
 idea that you do it with your vehicles 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:56.130
 because they will simply explode and good 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:58.200

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.789
