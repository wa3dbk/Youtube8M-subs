00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:08.020 

there<00:01:05.960> are<00:01:06.110> three<00:01:06.440> main<00:01:06.770> advantages<00:01:07.580> to

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:08.030 
there are three main advantages to

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:22.790 
the alternatives I think this is

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:25.120 
the alternatives I think this is
important<00:01:23.330> reason<00:01:23.750> because<00:01:24.590> Ecuadorian

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:25.130 
important reason because Ecuadorian

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:30.820

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:36.940 
because you have you don't have to wait

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:40.570 
because you have you don't have to wait

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:46.550 
restaurant this is different the third

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:50.230 
restaurant this is different the third
advantage<00:01:46.880> is<00:01:47.650> there<00:01:48.650> are<00:01:48.830> many<00:01:49.130> healthy<00:01:49.850> fast

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:50.240 
advantage is there are many healthy fast

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:53.890 
advantage is there are many healthy fast
food<00:01:50.390> options<00:01:50.869> now<00:01:51.759> so<00:01:52.759> it's<00:01:53.090> not<00:01:53.300> necessary

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:53.900 
food options now so it's not necessary

I<00:01:58.790> think<00:01:58.940> is<00:01:59.360> the<00:01:59.509> main<00:02:00.220> advantages

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:02.659 
I think is the main advantages

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:07.199 
I think is the main advantages
let's<00:02:03.590> see<00:02:03.950> some<00:02:05.020> disadvantages<00:02:06.020> of
