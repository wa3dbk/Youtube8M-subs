00:00:00.839 --> 00:00:04.890
 Ai Hello this is an investment of opening the road of Three Kingdoms War 

00:00:04.889 --> 00:00:06.150
 I would like 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:08.249
 This time is it 

00:00:08.249 --> 00:00:11.249
 It started in Korea as a result 

00:00:12.369 --> 00:00:14.529
 We announced this time this time 

00:00:14.529 --> 00:00:17.240
 This time 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:19.060
 I wish it was a cover-up 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:21.679
 There was one meeting 

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:24.220
 It's also a filter but it's not hit 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:27.750
 I think it would be nice if it was done and it was empty in one night 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.750
 I want to go 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:36.539
 It is a trip 

00:00:36.539 --> 00:00:39.539
 I'll publish it 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:42.850
 I will pull 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:45.850
 Then it is the second piece 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:51.400
 Oh, I'm taking a little out with this 

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:54.190
 here 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:57.190
 I will go in the rain 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:02.320
 This too 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:04.410
 You are father 

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:07.750
 Personally, the previous revised high-speed response was good 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:10.750
 I think 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.400
 It is good to four places 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:21.450
 Tsuneyuki 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.280
 It is transmission 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.280
 Pretty good 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.990
 Rear king of vegetables 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:31.990
 I want to go on bamboo 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:37.800
 It is registration challenge regardless of nine days 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:42.110
 It's a hot water store 

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:46.550
 Suspicion of the most powerful force in the second quarter of October-December 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:50.710
 Two of the six have been incorporated with launch speed and energy 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:56.960
 I think that it is excellent for the development that considered the straw well 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:02.720
 Locally overwhelming and want to get on the truck 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:05.720
 I think it is not suitable for a while 

00:02:09.079 --> 00:02:11.680
 Well from now on, isn't it like this? 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:13.459
 I hit in front 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:16.459
 I think it's pretty good 

00:02:17.089 --> 00:02:20.219
 Because I was only going to change in this direction later 

00:02:20.929 --> 00:02:22.999
 This time is appropriate 

00:02:22.999 --> 00:02:26.489
 It is not, but I think it was a good result this time 

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:28.499
 I want to finish it here
