to prevent anything like that I'm gonna

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:44.980 
to prevent anything like that I'm gonna
use<00:01:43.070> a<00:01:43.100> plastic<00:01:43.400> scraper<00:01:43.880> I<00:01:44.300> like<00:01:44.570> to<00:01:44.690> take<00:01:44.869> my

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:52.180 

there<00:01:50.840> are<00:01:50.930> two<00:01:51.110> ways<00:01:51.320> you<00:01:51.530> can<00:01:51.650> spray<00:01:51.950> it<00:01:51.979> you

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:52.190 
there are two ways you can spray it you

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:54.400 
there are two ways you can spray it you
can<00:01:52.369> push<00:01:52.670> the<00:01:52.910> scraper<00:01:53.210> along<00:01:53.600> the<00:01:53.750> ski<00:01:53.990> or

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:54.410 
can push the scraper along the ski or

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:56.440 
can push the scraper along the ski or
you<00:01:54.590> can<00:01:54.770> pull<00:01:55.040> it<00:01:55.190> I'll<00:01:55.400> demonstrate<00:01:55.670> pulling

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:56.450 
you can pull it I'll demonstrate pulling

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:57.730 
you can pull it I'll demonstrate pulling
and<00:01:56.630> then<00:01:56.690> I'll<00:01:56.810> demonstrate<00:01:57.020> pushing

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:57.740 
and then I'll demonstrate pushing

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:11.350 
and then I'll demonstrate pushing
starting<00:01:58.580> at<00:01:58.700> the<00:01:58.820> tip<00:02:09.429> when<00:02:10.429> I<00:02:10.460> spray<00:02:10.850> the

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:11.360 
starting at the tip when I spray the

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:48.220 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:51.910 

okay<00:02:49.220> that's<00:02:49.670> the<00:02:49.849> pulling<00:02:50.030> technique<00:02:50.920> now

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:51.920 
okay that's the pulling technique now

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:54.569 
okay that's the pulling technique now
the<00:02:51.980> pushing<00:02:52.459> technique<00:02:52.819> is<00:02:53.239> just<00:02:53.540> the<00:02:53.659> same

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:54.579 
the pushing technique is just the same

00:02:54.579 --> 00:02:57.160 
the pushing technique is just the same
except<00:02:55.579> I'm<00:02:55.760> cutting<00:02:56.120> with<00:02:56.329> this<00:02:56.540> portion<00:02:56.900> of

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:57.170 
except I'm cutting with this portion of

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:59.440 
except I'm cutting with this portion of
the<00:02:57.290> blade<00:02:57.500> and<00:02:57.829> pressing<00:02:58.670> down<00:02:58.849> onto<00:02:59.359> the

00:02:59.440 --> 00:02:59.450 
the blade and pressing down onto the

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:01.000 
the blade and pressing down onto the
base<00:02:59.629> you<00:02:59.900> want<00:03:00.079> to<00:03:00.170> be<00:03:00.230> careful<00:03:00.590> not<00:03:00.709> to<00:03:00.769> press

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.010 
base you want to be careful not to press

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:01.750 
base you want to be careful not to press
too<00:03:01.099> hard

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:01.760 
too hard

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:11.339 
too hard
use<00:03:02.090> your<00:03:02.269> thumbs<00:03:02.569> to<00:03:02.780> pressure<00:03:03.200> up<00:03:03.439> the<00:03:03.590> blade

00:03:11.339 --> 00:03:11.349 

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:13.780 

we're<00:03:12.349> now<00:03:12.439> ready<00:03:12.650> to<00:03:12.799> brush<00:03:13.069> the<00:03:13.340> structure

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:13.790 
we're now ready to brush the structure

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:15.670 
we're now ready to brush the structure
of<00:03:14.359> the<00:03:15.230> ski

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:15.680 
of the ski

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:18.160 
of the ski
so<00:03:16.040> we've<00:03:16.790> taken<00:03:16.970> wax<00:03:17.329> off<00:03:17.569> the<00:03:17.720> surface<00:03:18.019> at

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:18.170 
so we've taken wax off the surface at

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:20.619 
so we've taken wax off the surface at
the<00:03:18.260> ski<00:03:18.500> now<00:03:19.370> we<00:03:19.430> need<00:03:19.639> to<00:03:19.730> take<00:03:19.879> the<00:03:20.060> wax<00:03:20.299> off

00:03:20.619 --> 00:03:20.629 
the ski now we need to take the wax off

00:03:20.629 --> 00:03:23.289 
the ski now we need to take the wax off
the<00:03:21.250> topography<00:03:22.250> of<00:03:22.280> the<00:03:22.549> structure<00:03:23.060> of<00:03:23.180> the

00:03:23.289 --> 00:03:23.299 
the topography of the structure of the

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:27.670 
the topography of the structure of the
ski<00:03:23.560> so<00:03:24.560> that<00:03:24.769> we<00:03:25.549> only<00:03:25.700> need<00:03:26.000> wax<00:03:26.359> in<00:03:27.170> the

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:27.680 
ski so that we only need wax in the

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:28.990 
ski so that we only need wax in the
structure<00:03:28.099> itself<00:03:28.430> we're<00:03:28.670> in<00:03:28.790> the

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:29.000 
structure itself we're in the

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.059 
structure itself we're in the
polyethylene<00:03:29.659> material<00:03:29.840> but<00:03:30.709> not<00:03:30.739> at<00:03:31.010> the

00:03:31.059 --> 00:03:31.069 
polyethylene material but not at the

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:33.610 
polyethylene material but not at the
surface<00:03:31.280> so<00:03:31.909> we're<00:03:32.569> gonna<00:03:32.659> we're<00:03:33.200> gonna<00:03:33.319> brush

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:33.620 
surface so we're gonna we're gonna brush

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:36.009 
surface so we're gonna we're gonna brush
all<00:03:34.340> that<00:03:34.579> extra<00:03:34.909> wax<00:03:35.030> out<00:03:35.359> of<00:03:35.420> the<00:03:35.659> structure

00:03:36.009 --> 00:03:36.019 
all that extra wax out of the structure

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:37.960 
all that extra wax out of the structure
of<00:03:36.109> the<00:03:36.200> ski<00:03:36.379> now<00:03:36.889> start<00:03:37.189> off<00:03:37.280> with<00:03:37.489> a<00:03:37.519> copper

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:37.970 
of the ski now start off with a copper

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:45.759 
of the ski now start off with a copper
metal<00:03:38.329> brush<00:03:43.060> you<00:03:44.060> can<00:03:44.239> see<00:03:44.540> quite<00:03:45.470> a<00:03:45.530> bit<00:03:45.620> of

00:03:45.759 --> 00:03:45.769 
metal brush you can see quite a bit of

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:49.479 
metal brush you can see quite a bit of
wax<00:03:46.129> left<00:03:46.489> in<00:03:46.699> the<00:03:46.790> structure<00:03:48.099> all<00:03:49.099> of<00:03:49.310> that

00:03:49.479 --> 00:03:49.489 
wax left in the structure all of that

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:51.520 
wax left in the structure all of that
wax<00:03:49.760> eventually<00:03:50.480> you<00:03:50.599> would<00:03:50.780> ski<00:03:51.049> off<00:03:51.230> but

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:51.530 
wax eventually you would ski off but

00:03:51.530 --> 00:04:00.380 
wax eventually you would ski off but
it's<00:03:51.680> very<00:03:51.949> slow<00:03:52.310> especially<00:03:52.639> for<00:03:53.060> a<00:03:53.180> skis

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:00.390 

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:06.330 

two<00:04:01.390> passions<00:04:01.959> with<00:04:02.110> each<00:04:02.290> brush<00:04:04.890> is<00:04:05.890> probably

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:06.340 
two passions with each brush is probably

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:10.260 
two passions with each brush is probably
sufficient<00:04:06.580> for<00:04:07.150> recreational<00:04:07.780> skis<00:04:09.270> you

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:10.270 
sufficient for recreational skis you

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:11.790 
sufficient for recreational skis you
notice<00:04:10.569> I'm<00:04:10.690> using<00:04:10.720> overlapping<00:04:11.319> strokes

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:11.800 
notice I'm using overlapping strokes

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:15.780 
notice I'm using overlapping strokes
going<00:04:12.190> from<00:04:12.430> tip<00:04:12.640> to<00:04:12.670> tail<00:04:14.459> now<00:04:15.459> I'm<00:04:15.580> gonna<00:04:15.670> use

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:15.790 
going from tip to tail now I'm gonna use

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:24.210 
going from tip to tail now I'm gonna use
a<00:04:15.910> stiff<00:04:16.389> nylon<00:04:16.630> brush<00:04:22.620> put<00:04:23.620> my<00:04:23.770> hand<00:04:24.010> under

a stiff nylon brush put my hand under
the<00:04:24.340> strap<00:04:24.669> a<00:04:24.850> little<00:04:24.880> better<00:04:25.270> purchase<00:04:25.690> on

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:25.810 
the strap a little better purchase on

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:29.520 
the strap a little better purchase on
the<00:04:25.900> brush<00:04:26.110> I'm<00:04:26.669> using<00:04:27.669> a<00:04:27.880> stroke<00:04:28.300> that's<00:04:28.570> kind

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:29.530 
the brush I'm using a stroke that's kind

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:31.560 
the brush I'm using a stroke that's kind
of<00:04:29.590> a<00:04:29.919> rotating<00:04:30.790> stroke<00:04:31.090> let's<00:04:31.270> start<00:04:31.480> with

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:31.570 
of a rotating stroke let's start with

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:42.870 
of a rotating stroke let's start with
the<00:04:31.630> front<00:04:31.870> of<00:04:31.900> the<00:04:31.990> brush<00:04:32.200> and<00:04:32.560> finish<00:04:32.830> up

as<00:04:43.880> you<00:04:43.970> can<00:04:44.120> see<00:04:44.300> I'm<00:04:44.420> still<00:04:44.690> pulling<00:04:44.990> wax<00:04:45.320> out

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:45.590 
as you can see I'm still pulling wax out

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:49.750 
as you can see I'm still pulling wax out
of<00:04:45.620> the<00:04:45.740> scripture<00:04:47.680> but<00:04:48.680> less<00:04:48.950> and<00:04:49.250> less<00:04:49.400> wax

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:49.760 
of the scripture but less and less wax

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:52.300 
of the scripture but less and less wax
each<00:04:50.090> time<00:04:50.390> I<00:04:50.540> change<00:04:50.810> my<00:04:51.020> brush<00:04:51.260> soft<00:04:51.950> nylon

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:48.420 
wax out of the base as you ski

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:50.780 
wax out of the base as you ski
so<00:05:49.290> yes<00:05:49.680> you<00:05:49.890> do<00:05:50.040> need<00:05:50.250> to<00:05:50.340> wax<00:05:50.580> your<00:05:50.760> skis

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:50.790
