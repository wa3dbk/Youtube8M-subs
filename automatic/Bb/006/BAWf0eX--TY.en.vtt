00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:21.120 
differences between the triple jump
without<00:02:19.239> the<00:02:19.569> boots<00:02:19.780> and<00:02:20.170> the<00:02:20.260> quadruped<00:02:20.950> will

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:21.130 
without the boots and the quadruped will

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:23.729 
without the boots and the quadruped will
jump<00:02:21.370> with<00:02:21.580> the<00:02:21.610> boots<00:02:22.019> the<00:02:23.019> triple<00:02:23.350> jump<00:02:23.500> was

00:02:23.729 --> 00:02:23.739 
jump with the boots the triple jump was

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:26.130 
jump with the boots the triple jump was
already<00:02:24.010> pretty<00:02:24.280> decent<00:02:24.849> and<00:02:25.090> I<00:02:25.450> never<00:02:25.840> really

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.140 
already pretty decent and I never really

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:27.390 
already pretty decent and I never really
used<00:02:26.290> it<00:02:26.440> that<00:02:26.560> much<00:02:26.739> because<00:02:26.890> it's<00:02:27.160> three

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400 
used it that much because it's three

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.370 
used it that much because it's three
small<00:02:27.730> bursts<00:02:28.150> and<00:02:28.299> it<00:02:28.569> just<00:02:28.750> annoying<00:02:29.049> me<00:02:29.230> to

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:29.380 
small bursts and it just annoying me to

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:31.319 
small bursts and it just annoying me to
be<00:02:29.500> honest<00:02:29.680> with<00:02:29.799> you<00:02:29.980> but<00:02:30.519> here<00:02:30.700> we<00:02:30.790> go<00:02:30.940> anyway

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:31.329 
be honest with you but here we go anyway

00:02:31.329 --> 00:02:33.930 
be honest with you but here we go anyway
there's<00:02:31.900> the<00:02:32.200> triple<00:02:33.010> jump<00:02:33.130> set<00:02:33.430> on<00:02:33.579> the

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:33.940 
there's the triple jump set on the

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:37.020 
there's the triple jump set on the
gunslinger<00:02:34.510> class<00:02:35.250> without<00:02:36.250> the<00:02:36.640> bones<00:02:36.850> of

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.030 
gunslinger class without the bones of

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:41.099 
gunslinger class without the bones of
you<00:02:37.209> and<00:02:37.510> here<00:02:38.170> we<00:02:38.200> go<00:02:38.470> so<00:02:38.769> so<00:02:39.100> one<00:02:39.400> A<00:02:39.640> two<00:02:40.060> and<00:02:40.600> A

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:41.109 
you and here we go so so one A two and A

00:02:41.109 --> 00:02:42.990 
you and here we go so so one A two and A
three<00:02:41.140> and<00:02:41.680> you<00:02:41.799> drop<00:02:42.100> off<00:02:42.280> literally<00:02:42.670> just

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.000 
three and you drop off literally just

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.030 
three and you drop off literally just
before<00:02:43.359> the<00:02:43.450> build<00:02:43.660> in<00:02:43.870> there<00:02:44.109> can't<00:02:44.680> get<00:02:44.920> up

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.040 
before the build in there can't get up

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:48.060 
before the build in there can't get up
there<00:02:45.220> with<00:02:45.340> a<00:02:45.370> triple<00:02:45.609> jump<00:02:46.030> and<00:02:46.590> but<00:02:47.590> you

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:48.070 
there with a triple jump and but you

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:50.880 
there with a triple jump and but you
know<00:02:48.250> with<00:02:49.090> the<00:02:49.239> bones<00:02:49.420> of<00:02:49.540> you<00:02:49.810> it's<00:02:50.410> a<00:02:50.620> breeze

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:50.890 
know with the bones of you it's a breeze

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:53.130 
know with the bones of you it's a breeze
I<00:02:51.190> mean<00:02:51.609> literally<00:02:52.060> I<00:02:52.150> think<00:02:52.450> it's<00:02:52.840> ridiculous

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:53.140 
I mean literally I think it's ridiculous

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:55.740 
I mean literally I think it's ridiculous
how<00:02:53.620> far<00:02:53.950> you<00:02:54.010> can<00:02:54.100> go<00:02:54.250> with<00:02:54.280> the<00:02:54.519> quad<00:02:54.730> drum<00:02:55.000> to

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:55.750 
how far you can go with the quad drum to

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:58.530 
how far you can go with the quad drum to
a<00:02:55.780> pop<00:02:56.049> those<00:02:56.260> on<00:02:56.579> that<00:02:57.579> turns<00:02:57.880> your<00:02:58.120> normal

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:58.540 
a pop those on that turns your normal

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:01.800 
a pop those on that turns your normal
triple<00:02:58.870> jump<00:02:59.190> onto<00:03:00.190> a<00:03:00.220> quad<00:03:00.910> jump<00:03:01.209> so<00:03:01.540> I<00:03:01.569> should

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:01.810 
triple jump onto a quad jump so I should

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:03.180 
triple jump onto a quad jump so I should
show<00:03:01.989> you<00:03:02.019> the<00:03:02.200> difference<00:03:02.530> on<00:03:02.680> that<00:03:02.709> one<00:03:03.010> now

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:03.190 
show you the difference on that one now

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:07.590 
show you the difference on that one now
if<00:03:04.180> we<00:03:04.359> go<00:03:04.390> one<00:03:04.810> two<00:03:05.670> three<00:03:06.670> and<00:03:06.970> the<00:03:07.329> fourth

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:07.600 
if we go one two three and the fourth

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:10.770 
if we go one two three and the fourth
one<00:03:07.900> BAM<00:03:08.410> here<00:03:09.069> we<00:03:09.190> go<00:03:09.370> i<00:03:09.400> mean<00:03:09.700> probably<00:03:10.180> I

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:10.780 
one BAM here we go i mean probably I

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:12.960 
one BAM here we go i mean probably I
think<00:03:11.470> definitely<00:03:11.680> further<00:03:12.160> than<00:03:12.459> the<00:03:12.639> the

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:12.970 
think definitely further than the the

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:14.940 
think definitely further than the the
double<00:03:13.690> jump<00:03:13.900> into<00:03:14.109> a<00:03:14.260> triple<00:03:14.560> because

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:14.950 
double jump into a triple because

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:16.680 
double jump into a triple because
obviously<00:03:15.130> that's<00:03:15.489> still<00:03:15.760> a<00:03:15.790> further<00:03:16.090> triple

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:16.690 
obviously that's still a further triple

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:18.000 
obviously that's still a further triple
jump<00:03:16.900> than<00:03:17.049> the<00:03:17.170> normal<00:03:17.530> trouble<00:03:17.829> jump

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.010 
jump than the normal trouble jump

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:19.470 
jump than the normal trouble jump
because<00:03:18.220> one<00:03:18.370> of<00:03:18.400> them<00:03:18.609> has<00:03:18.760> extended<00:03:19.299> the

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:19.480 
because one of them has extended the

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:21.870 
because one of them has extended the
second<00:03:19.840> jump<00:03:20.049> but<00:03:20.739> yeah<00:03:20.980> I<00:03:21.190> really<00:03:21.519> love<00:03:21.730> these

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:21.880 
second jump but yeah I really love these

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:24.120 
second jump but yeah I really love these
boots<00:03:22.120> guys<00:03:22.480> you<00:03:23.350> know<00:03:23.500> if<00:03:23.590> you've<00:03:23.709> got<00:03:23.920> hella
