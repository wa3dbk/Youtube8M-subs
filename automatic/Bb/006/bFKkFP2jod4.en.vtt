00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:20.840 
features that i like is that now another
portal<00:00:19.230> instead<00:00:19.560> of<00:00:19.650> just<00:00:19.830> only<00:00:20.189> being<00:00:20.640> able

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
portal instead of just only being able

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:22.759 
portal instead of just only being able
to<00:00:20.910> be<00:00:21.000> ignited<00:00:21.420> from<00:00:21.539> the<00:00:21.660> bottom<00:00:22.080> it<00:00:22.560> could

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
to be ignited from the bottom it could

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:24.759 
to be ignited from the bottom it could
be<00:00:22.859> done<00:00:23.130> from<00:00:23.369> any<00:00:23.640> block<00:00:23.939> within<00:00:24.180> the<00:00:24.359> frame

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:07.880 
button twice just to get rid of the
water<00:01:06.210> now<00:01:06.780> what<00:01:06.960> you<00:01:07.049> could<00:01:07.260> do<00:01:07.380> to<00:01:07.409> improve

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
water now what you could do to improve

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.370 
water now what you could do to improve
this<00:01:08.189> system<00:01:08.580> is<00:01:08.760> to<00:01:09.240> hook<00:01:09.420> this<00:01:09.750> button<00:01:10.140> up<00:01:10.229> to

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
this system is to hook this button up to

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.679 
this system is to hook this button up to
like<00:01:10.530> a<00:01:10.560> double<00:01:10.680> pulse<00:01:11.310> thing<00:01:11.610> where<00:01:12.240> it<00:01:12.540> would

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
like a double pulse thing where it would

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:15.320 
like a double pulse thing where it would
pulse<00:01:12.990> this<00:01:13.229> dispenser<00:01:13.619> twice<00:01:14.100> so<00:01:14.909> would<00:01:15.119> pick

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
pulse this dispenser twice so would pick

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.060 
pulse this dispenser twice so would pick
up<00:01:15.479> the<00:01:15.600> water<00:01:15.810> before<00:01:16.080> you<00:01:16.380> can<00:01:16.500> got<00:01:16.650> outside

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
up the water before you can got outside

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.219 
up the water before you can got outside
the<00:01:17.250> portal<00:01:17.610> frame<00:01:17.850> like<00:01:18.720> I<00:01:18.840> said<00:01:19.020> this<00:01:19.170> is

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
the portal frame like I said this is

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:20.870 
the portal frame like I said this is
just<00:01:19.409> something<00:01:19.590> simple<00:01:19.860> that<00:01:20.040> I<00:01:20.220> came<00:01:20.820> up

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
just something simple that I came up

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.789 
just something simple that I came up
with<00:01:21.030> you<00:01:21.509> know<00:01:21.540> if<00:01:21.960> I<00:01:22.259> could<00:01:22.439> figure<00:01:22.560> it<00:01:22.710> out

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
with you know if I could figure it out

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.039 
with you know if I could figure it out
you<00:01:22.979> could<00:01:23.280> so<00:01:23.640> it's<00:01:24.299> nothing<00:01:24.420> special<00:01:24.810> just

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
you could so it's nothing special just

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.620 
you could so it's nothing special just
you<00:01:25.470> know<00:01:25.950> it<00:01:26.189> can<00:01:26.310> be<00:01:26.340> improved<00:01:26.640> upon<00:01:26.880> easily

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
you know it can be improved upon easily

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.620 
you know it can be improved upon easily
but<00:01:28.110> um<00:01:28.320> that's<00:01:28.650> my<00:01:28.740> little<00:01:29.070> system<00:01:29.460> I<00:01:29.610> like<00:01:30.479> it

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
but um that's my little system I like it

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.469 
but um that's my little system I like it
maybe<00:01:30.780> I'll<00:01:30.960> use<00:01:31.110> it<00:01:31.140> and<00:01:31.970> nether<00:01:32.970> portal<00:01:33.329> can

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
maybe I'll use it and nether portal can

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:34.819 
maybe I'll use it and nether portal can
also<00:01:33.630> be<00:01:33.840> in<00:01:33.930> different<00:01:34.110> shapes<00:01:34.530> but

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
also be in different shapes but

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:36.859 
also be in different shapes but
unfortunately<00:01:35.640> you<00:01:36.180> can't<00:01:36.420> make<00:01:36.600> them<00:01:36.750> on

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
unfortunately you can't make them on

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.249 
unfortunately you can't make them on
their<00:01:37.020> sites<00:01:37.290> like<00:01:37.560> this<00:01:37.770> like<00:01:37.979> end<00:01:38.159> portals

00:01:39.249 --> 00:01:39.259 
their sites like this like end portals

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:42.920 
their sites like this like end portals
but<00:01:40.259> what<00:01:40.409> you<00:01:40.530> can<00:01:40.770> do<00:01:41.659> actually<00:01:42.659> here's<00:01:42.840> a

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
but what you can do actually here's a

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.929 
but what you can do actually here's a
few<00:01:43.140> of<00:01:43.439> what<00:01:43.680> you<00:01:43.950> cannot<00:01:44.220> do<00:01:44.460> you<00:01:44.579> can't<00:01:44.820> make

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
few of what you cannot do you can't make

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:49.580 
few of what you cannot do you can't make
them<00:01:45.119> like<00:01:45.240> this<00:01:46.399> unfortunately<00:01:47.399> um<00:01:48.409> this<00:01:49.409> is

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
them like this unfortunately um this is

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.469 
them like this unfortunately um this is
basically<00:01:49.950> just<00:01:50.070> a<00:01:50.310> one<00:01:50.520> wide<00:01:50.729> another<00:01:51.030> portal

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
basically just a one wide another portal

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:52.850 
basically just a one wide another portal
which<00:01:51.630> is<00:01:51.810> the<00:01:52.020> same<00:01:52.320> height<00:01:52.530> of<00:01:52.649> a<00:01:52.829> standard

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
which is the same height of a standard

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.060 
which is the same height of a standard
one<00:01:53.509> this<00:01:54.509> is<00:01:54.869> a<00:01:54.930> one<00:01:55.290> high<00:01:55.439> another<00:01:55.680> portal

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
one this is a one high another portal

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.749 
one this is a one high another portal
this<00:01:56.219> is<00:01:56.899> actually<00:01:57.899> the<00:01:58.829> portal<00:01:59.189> frame<00:01:59.430> itself

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
this is actually the portal frame itself

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:03.319 
this is actually the portal frame itself
would<00:01:59.969> be<00:02:00.000> the<00:02:00.119> player<00:02:00.540> sized<00:02:02.000> but<00:02:03.000> you<00:02:03.119> can't

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
would be the player sized but you can't

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:05.300 
would be the player sized but you can't
do<00:02:03.450> that<00:02:03.479> unfortunately<00:02:04.200> either<00:02:04.409> but<00:02:05.219> now

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
do that unfortunately either but now

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.029 
do that unfortunately either but now
what<00:02:05.430> you<00:02:05.549> can<00:02:05.579> do<00:02:05.939> is<00:02:06.119> this<00:02:06.420> is<00:02:06.540> pretty<00:02:06.780> cool

00:02:07.029 --> 00:02:07.039 
what you can do is this is pretty cool

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:09.680 
what you can do is this is pretty cool
here<00:02:08.039> I<00:02:08.069> have<00:02:08.250> two<00:02:08.459> portal<00:02:08.879> frames<00:02:09.149> as<00:02:09.450> you<00:02:09.569> can

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
here I have two portal frames as you can

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.479 
here I have two portal frames as you can
see<00:02:09.899> I'm<00:02:10.289> gonna<00:02:10.500> light<00:02:10.679> the<00:02:10.800> back<00:02:10.950> one<00:02:11.190> first

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
see I'm gonna light the back one first

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:13.370 
see I'm gonna light the back one first
and<00:02:11.760> as<00:02:11.849> you<00:02:11.940> can<00:02:12.060> see<00:02:12.090> you<00:02:12.450> know<00:02:12.569> so

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
and as you can see you know so

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.430 
and as you can see you know so
purple<00:02:13.770> portal<00:02:14.130> frame<00:02:14.340> blocks<00:02:14.850> you<00:02:15.270> know

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:15.440 
purple portal frame blocks you know

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:18.760 
purple portal frame blocks you know
normal<00:02:16.440> but<00:02:17.220> when<00:02:17.640> you<00:02:17.730> light<00:02:17.970> this<00:02:18.180> portal

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:18.770 
normal but when you light this portal

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:23.060 
normal but when you light this portal
gone<00:02:19.790> the<00:02:20.790> portal<00:02:21.360> frame<00:02:21.840> blocks<00:02:22.200> disappear<00:02:22.920> I

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:23.070 
gone the portal frame blocks disappear I

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:26.120 
gone the portal frame blocks disappear I
don't<00:02:23.340> know<00:02:23.430> why<00:02:23.670> this<00:02:23.730> might<00:02:24.540> be<00:02:24.750> a<00:02:24.780> bug<00:02:25.260> but

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.130 
don't know why this might be a bug but

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:27.830 
don't know why this might be a bug but
if<00:02:26.430> you<00:02:26.790> go<00:02:26.970> through<00:02:27.240> this<00:02:27.360> it'll<00:02:27.540> still

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
if you go through this it'll still

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:31.010 
if you go through this it'll still
teleport<00:02:28.440> you<00:02:28.590> so<00:02:28.980> um<00:02:29.310> there's<00:02:30.120> that<00:02:30.420> and<00:02:30.690> you

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:31.020 
teleport you so um there's that and you

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:32.720 
teleport you so um there's that and you
can<00:02:31.140> also<00:02:31.440> destroy<00:02:31.830> blocks<00:02:32.160> and<00:02:32.370> creative

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
can also destroy blocks and creative

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:35.750 
can also destroy blocks and creative
apparently<00:02:33.350> now<00:02:34.350> this<00:02:34.740> nether<00:02:35.040> portal<00:02:35.460> is<00:02:35.610> the

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
apparently now this nether portal is the

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.340 
apparently now this nether portal is the
same<00:02:35.940> height<00:02:36.180> of<00:02:36.300> a<00:02:36.360> standard<00:02:36.390> nether<00:02:36.900> portal

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:37.350 
same height of a standard nether portal

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:39.560 
same height of a standard nether portal
except<00:02:37.830> it<00:02:38.040> is<00:02:38.190> three<00:02:38.640> blocks<00:02:38.790> wide<00:02:39.210> as

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:39.570 
except it is three blocks wide as

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:42.440 
except it is three blocks wide as
opposed<00:02:40.560> to<00:02:40.920> so<00:02:41.250> in<00:02:41.550> other<00:02:41.700> words<00:02:41.970> in<00:02:42.210> odd

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
opposed to so in other words in odd

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:45.140 
opposed to so in other words in odd
block<00:02:43.220> nether<00:02:44.220> portal<00:02:44.640> let's<00:02:44.850> see<00:02:44.970> if<00:02:45.030> this

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
block nether portal let's see if this

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:49.550 
block nether portal let's see if this
one<00:02:45.300> will<00:02:45.420> work<00:02:46.340> yep<00:02:47.340> very<00:02:48.030> nice<00:02:48.380> this<00:02:49.380> is

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
one will work yep very nice this is

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.710 
one will work yep very nice this is
going<00:02:49.680> to<00:02:49.770> revolutionize<00:02:49.920> nether<00:02:50.910> hubs<00:02:51.210> it

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
going to revolutionize nether hubs it

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:55.220 
going to revolutionize nether hubs it
really<00:02:52.080> is<00:02:52.200> you<00:02:52.470> get<00:02:52.710> the<00:02:53.540> the<00:02:54.540> odd<00:02:54.690> shape<00:02:55.020> and

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
really is you get the the odd shape and

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:56.870 
really is you get the the odd shape and
then<00:02:55.320> everyone<00:02:55.830> knows<00:02:55.950> it's<00:02:56.160> easier<00:02:56.550> to<00:02:56.760> work

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
then everyone knows it's easier to work

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:59.900 
then everyone knows it's easier to work
with<00:02:56.940> odd<00:02:57.420> numbers<00:02:57.960> so<00:02:58.170> um<00:02:58.620> this<00:02:59.340> is<00:02:59.580> going<00:02:59.820> to

00:02:59.900 --> 00:02:59.910 
with odd numbers so um this is going to

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:01.700 
with odd numbers so um this is going to
loop<00:03:00.150> this<00:03:00.690> is<00:03:00.900> going<00:03:01.110> to<00:03:01.230> be<00:03:01.320> really<00:03:01.440> awesome

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:01.710 
loop this is going to be really awesome

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:04.310 
loop this is going to be really awesome
let's<00:03:02.070> keep<00:03:02.250> that<00:03:02.400> one<00:03:02.580> with<00:03:02.790> this<00:03:03.720> one<00:03:03.990> is<00:03:04.170> the

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:04.320 
let's keep that one with this one is the

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:05.780 
let's keep that one with this one is the
same<00:03:04.500> thing<00:03:04.530> as<00:03:04.740> this<00:03:04.920> one<00:03:05.160> essentially<00:03:05.640> but

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
same thing as this one essentially but

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:07.190 
same thing as this one essentially but
one<00:03:05.940> block<00:03:06.150> higher<00:03:06.390> to<00:03:06.600> make<00:03:06.720> it<00:03:06.840> look<00:03:07.050> a

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 
one block higher to make it look a

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.140 
one block higher to make it look a
little<00:03:07.320> bit<00:03:07.560> better<00:03:07.700> cuz<00:03:08.700> that<00:03:08.850> thing<00:03:09.030> one

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
little bit better cuz that thing one

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:10.730 
little bit better cuz that thing one
looks<00:03:09.360> to<00:03:09.450> square<00:03:09.840> this<00:03:09.960> looks<00:03:10.200> more<00:03:10.290> correct

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:10.740 
looks to square this looks more correct

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:12.740 
looks to square this looks more correct
table<00:03:11.070> and<00:03:11.190> as<00:03:11.280> you<00:03:11.400> can<00:03:11.520> see<00:03:11.550> this<00:03:12.360> one<00:03:12.540> works

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
table and as you can see this one works

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:16.460 
table and as you can see this one works
as<00:03:12.930> well<00:03:13.370> now<00:03:14.370> I<00:03:14.760> bet<00:03:15.450> you're<00:03:15.600> wondering<00:03:15.930> just

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
as well now I bet you're wondering just

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:17.780 
as well now I bet you're wondering just
how<00:03:16.620> big<00:03:16.800> can<00:03:17.070> you<00:03:17.220> make<00:03:17.370> these<00:03:17.520> nether

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790 
how big can you make these nether

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:21.850 
how big can you make these nether
portals<00:03:19.430> you<00:03:20.430> can<00:03:20.640> make<00:03:20.790> them<00:03:21.030> this<00:03:21.420> big

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:21.860 
portals you can make them this big

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:24.230 
portals you can make them this big
that's<00:03:22.860> pretty<00:03:23.220> big<00:03:23.340> nether<00:03:23.580> portal<00:03:23.940> isn't<00:03:24.090> it

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:24.240 
that's pretty big nether portal isn't it

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:29.480 
that's pretty big nether portal isn't it
let's<00:03:25.050> turn<00:03:25.260> it<00:03:25.380> on<00:03:26.750> there<00:03:27.750> you<00:03:27.930> go<00:03:28.160> that's<00:03:29.160> a

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:29.490 
let's turn it on there you go that's a

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:31.070 
let's turn it on there you go that's a
pretty<00:03:29.670> big<00:03:29.880> portal<00:03:30.330> if<00:03:30.390> I<00:03:30.480> do<00:03:30.540> say<00:03:30.810> so<00:03:30.840> myself

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:31.080 
pretty big portal if I do say so myself

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:34.990 
pretty big portal if I do say so myself
and<00:03:32.540> basically<00:03:33.540> the<00:03:33.750> portals<00:03:34.110> can<00:03:34.260> now<00:03:34.410> be

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:35.000 
and basically the portals can now be

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.580 
and basically the portals can now be
between<00:03:36.000> anywhere<00:03:36.600> from<00:03:36.750> the<00:03:36.930> standard<00:03:37.320> size

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 
between anywhere from the standard size

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:41.000 
between anywhere from the standard size
which<00:03:37.920> is<00:03:38.210> like<00:03:39.210> three<00:03:39.840> by<00:03:40.020> four<00:03:40.080> I<00:03:40.440> think<00:03:40.860> or

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.010 
which is like three by four I think or

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:45.320 
which is like three by four I think or

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:33.090 
they're spawning as I talk here but i

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:37.640 
they're spawning as I talk here but i
have<00:04:34.790> i've<00:04:35.790> set<00:04:36.150> the<00:04:36.180> game<00:04:36.570> mode<00:04:36.870> to<00:04:37.110> hard<00:04:37.140> as

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:37.650 
have i've set the game mode to hard as

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:39.440 
have i've set the game mode to hard as
soon<00:04:37.890> as<00:04:38.040> i<00:04:38.130> started<00:04:38.460> talking<00:04:38.790> at<00:04:39.150> the<00:04:39.240> very

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:39.450 
soon as i started talking at the very

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:41.120 
soon as i started talking at the very
beginning<00:04:39.570> of<00:04:39.810> the<00:04:39.870> video<00:04:39.990> and<00:04:40.410> basically

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:41.130 
beginning of the video and basically

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:43.970 
beginning of the video and basically
what<00:04:41.460> this<00:04:41.820> does<00:04:42.120> is<00:04:42.390> it<00:04:42.720> allows<00:04:42.780> an<00:04:43.320> infinite

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:43.980 
what this does is it allows an infinite

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:46.850 
what this does is it allows an infinite
number<00:04:44.010> of<00:04:44.370> zombie<00:04:45.300> pigmen<00:04:45.690> to<00:04:45.810> spawn<00:04:46.110> and<00:04:46.410> it

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:46.860 
number of zombie pigmen to spawn and it

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:48.970 
number of zombie pigmen to spawn and it
won't<00:04:47.040> count<00:04:47.340> towards<00:04:47.730> the<00:04:47.850> mob<00:04:48.030> cap<00:04:48.360> and

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:48.980 
won't count towards the mob cap and

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:52.220 
won't count towards the mob cap and
basically<00:04:49.980> it's<00:04:50.400> an<00:04:50.820> overworld<00:04:51.419> gold<00:04:51.870> farm

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:52.230 
basically it's an overworld gold farm

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:54.469 
basically it's an overworld gold farm
which<00:04:52.560> is<00:04:52.710> revolutionary<00:04:53.580> which<00:04:53.880> it's<00:04:54.240> just

at<00:05:37.830> a<00:05:37.860> few<00:05:37.919> commands<00:05:38.490> here<00:05:38.850> as<00:05:39.320> you<00:05:40.320> can<00:05:40.350> see<00:05:40.500> at

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:40.770 
at a few commands here as you can see at

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:44.120 
at a few commands here as you can see at
the<00:05:40.800> top<00:05:40.919> I<00:05:41.550> have<00:05:41.580> in<00:05:42.330> the<00:05:43.080> red<00:05:43.289> the<00:05:43.620> set<00:05:43.919> block

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:44.130 
the top I have in the red the set block

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:46.960 
the top I have in the red the set block
command<00:05:44.580> and<00:05:44.820> the<00:05:45.330> test<00:05:45.600> for<00:05:45.870> block<00:05:46.140> command

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:46.970 
command and the test for block command

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:49.279 
command and the test for block command
what<00:05:47.970> the<00:05:48.090> set<00:05:48.300> block<00:05:48.510> command<00:05:48.870> does<00:05:49.050> is

00:05:49.279 --> 00:05:49.289 
what the set block command does is

00:05:49.289 --> 00:05:50.990 
what the set block command does is
allows<00:05:49.590> you<00:05:49.770> to<00:05:49.890> set<00:05:50.100> blocks<00:05:50.370> without<00:05:50.580> the<00:05:50.850> use

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:51.000 
allows you to set blocks without the use

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.500 
allows you to set blocks without the use
of<00:05:51.030> falling<00:05:51.600> sand<00:05:51.930> which<00:05:52.970> to<00:05:53.970> be<00:05:54.090> honest<00:05:54.360> I'm

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:54.510 
of falling sand which to be honest I'm

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:55.850 
of falling sand which to be honest I'm
not<00:05:54.539> quite<00:05:54.870> sure<00:05:54.900> I<00:05:55.080> know<00:05:55.229> what<00:05:55.410> that<00:05:55.470> means

00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:55.860 
not quite sure I know what that means

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:57.770 
not quite sure I know what that means
but<00:05:56.190> that's<00:05:56.820> what<00:05:57.000> it<00:05:57.090> said<00:05:57.330> in<00:05:57.450> the<00:05:57.479> change

00:05:57.770 --> 00:05:57.780 
but that's what it said in the change

00:05:57.780 --> 00:05:59.089 
but that's what it said in the change
log<00:05:58.020> and<00:05:58.260> I'm<00:05:58.320> I<00:05:58.560> just<00:05:58.979> thought<00:05:59.039> of

00:05:59.089 --> 00:05:59.099 
log and I'm I just thought of

00:05:59.099 --> 00:06:01.010 
log and I'm I just thought of
significant<00:05:59.729> enough<00:05:59.880> to<00:05:59.940> bring<00:06:00.180> up<00:06:00.360> and<00:06:00.599> the

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:01.020 
significant enough to bring up and the

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:01.999 
significant enough to bring up and the
test<00:06:01.289> for<00:06:01.500> block

00:06:01.999 --> 00:06:02.009 
test for block

00:06:02.009 --> 00:06:04.159 
test for block
test<00:06:02.189> for<00:06:02.520> whatever<00:06:03.330> block<00:06:03.629> you<00:06:03.779> want<00:06:03.990> a

00:06:04.159 --> 00:06:04.169 
test for whatever block you want a

00:06:04.169 --> 00:06:07.969 
test for whatever block you want a
certain<00:06:04.499> area<00:06:04.979> so<00:06:05.369> um<00:06:06.319> there's<00:06:07.319> that<00:06:07.619> too<00:06:07.800> and

00:06:07.969 --> 00:06:07.979 
certain area so um there's that too and

00:06:07.979 --> 00:06:09.619 
certain area so um there's that too and
there's<00:06:08.129> also<00:06:08.339> an<00:06:08.580> improved<00:06:08.939> chat<00:06:09.300> system
