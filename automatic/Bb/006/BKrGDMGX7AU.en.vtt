00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:16.129 
from the left hand needle to the right

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:18.550 
from the left hand needle to the right
hand<00:00:16.430> needle<00:00:16.789> without<00:00:17.240> being<00:00:17.779> worked<00:00:18.079> that

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:18.560 
hand needle without being worked that

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:21.490 
hand needle without being worked that
means<00:00:18.770> you<00:00:19.130> do<00:00:19.310> not<00:00:19.340> knit<00:00:19.820> or<00:00:20.029> purl<00:00:20.360> it<00:00:20.750> there

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:21.500 
means you do not knit or purl it there

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:24.130 
means you do not knit or purl it there
is<00:00:21.590> a<00:00:21.619> general<00:00:22.160> rule<00:00:22.400> in<00:00:22.910> knitting<00:00:23.210> that

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:24.140 
is a general rule in knitting that

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:26.890 
is a general rule in knitting that
states<00:00:24.590> you<00:00:24.890> should<00:00:25.130> always<00:00:25.369> slip<00:00:26.210> as<00:00:26.240> if<00:00:26.539> to

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:26.900 
states you should always slip as if to

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:30.310 
states you should always slip as if to
purl<00:00:27.099> with<00:00:28.099> yarn<00:00:28.429> and<00:00:28.640> back<00:00:28.910> so<00:00:29.839> that<00:00:30.050> means

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:30.320 
purl with yarn and back so that means

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:32.770 
purl with yarn and back so that means
enter<00:00:30.919> the<00:00:31.189> stitch<00:00:31.490> on<00:00:31.730> the<00:00:31.970> left<00:00:32.269> hand<00:00:32.570> needle

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:32.780 
enter the stitch on the left hand needle

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:37.060 
enter the stitch on the left hand needle
as<00:00:33.140> if<00:00:33.199> to<00:00:33.620> purl<00:00:35.260> keeping<00:00:36.260> your<00:00:36.379> working<00:00:36.680> yarn

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:37.070 
as if to purl keeping your working yarn

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:41.799 
as if to purl keeping your working yarn
in<00:00:37.400> the<00:00:37.460> back<00:00:38.409> so<00:00:39.409> that<00:00:39.680> would<00:00:39.860> be<00:00:40.070> slip<00:00:40.489> 1<00:00:40.820> I'm

00:00:41.799 --> 00:00:41.809 
in the back so that would be slip 1 I'm

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:47.500 
in the back so that would be slip 1 I'm
going<00:00:41.960> to<00:00:42.079> knit<00:00:42.199> a<00:00:42.260> stitch<00:00:42.620> in<00:00:42.860> between<00:00:46.510> now

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:47.510 
going to knit a stitch in between now

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:49.420 
going to knit a stitch in between now
sometimes<00:00:48.050> it<00:00:48.199> can<00:00:48.350> be<00:00:48.440> tricky<00:00:48.710> in<00:00:48.920> a<00:00:48.980> pattern

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:49.430 
sometimes it can be tricky in a pattern

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:52.000 
sometimes it can be tricky in a pattern
because<00:00:49.609> it<00:00:49.969> will<00:00:50.210> just<00:00:50.239> say<00:00:50.660> slip<00:00:51.140> if<00:00:51.379> there

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:52.010 
because it will just say slip if there

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:54.610 
because it will just say slip if there
are<00:00:52.129> no<00:00:52.370> specific<00:00:52.699> directions<00:00:53.600> you<00:00:54.170> always

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:54.620 
are no specific directions you always

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:57.970 
are no specific directions you always
slip<00:00:55.250> as<00:00:55.309> if<00:00:55.550> to<00:00:55.910> purl<00:00:56.090> with<00:00:57.050> yarn<00:00:57.500> and<00:00:57.769> back

00:00:57.970 --> 00:00:57.980 
slip as if to purl with yarn and back

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:01.569 
slip as if to purl with yarn and back
the<00:00:58.940> reason<00:00:59.239> for<00:00:59.629> this<00:00:59.809> is<00:01:00.140> is<00:01:00.379> when<00:01:01.129> you<00:01:01.280> slip

00:01:01.569 --> 00:01:01.579 
the reason for this is is when you slip

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:04.180 
the reason for this is is when you slip
a<00:01:01.789> stitch<00:01:01.969> as<00:01:02.539> if<00:01:02.600> to<00:01:02.840> purl<00:01:03.019> it<00:01:03.980> is

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:04.190 
a stitch as if to purl it is

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:06.880 
a stitch as if to purl it is
automatically<00:01:05.089> seated<00:01:05.780> on<00:01:05.990> the<00:01:06.259> right<00:01:06.560> hand

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:06.890 
automatically seated on the right hand

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:10.240 
automatically seated on the right hand
needle<00:01:07.100> in<00:01:07.520> the<00:01:07.759> correct<00:01:08.240> position<00:01:08.899> and<00:01:09.250> when

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:10.250 
needle in the correct position and when

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:11.830 
needle in the correct position and when
you<00:01:10.399> have<00:01:10.610> your<00:01:10.789> working<00:01:11.240> yarn<00:01:11.479> in<00:01:11.690> the<00:01:11.720> back

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:11.840 
you have your working yarn in the back

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:14.730 
you have your working yarn in the back
or<00:01:12.560> on<00:01:12.800> the<00:01:12.830> wrong<00:01:13.130> side<00:01:13.460> of<00:01:13.610> the<00:01:13.729> work<00:01:13.940> that

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:14.740 
or on the wrong side of the work that

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:18.520 
or on the wrong side of the work that
strand<00:01:15.740> is<00:01:16.069> hidden<00:01:16.640> on<00:01:16.789> the<00:01:17.240> back<00:01:17.500> so<00:01:18.500> again

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:18.530 
strand is hidden on the back so again

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:22.449 
strand is hidden on the back so again
I'll<00:01:18.920> knit<00:01:19.220> a<00:01:19.250> stitch<00:01:19.670> and<00:01:20.679> slip<00:01:21.679> as<00:01:22.099> if<00:01:22.130> to

00:01:22.449 --> 00:01:22.459 
I'll knit a stitch and slip as if to

00:01:22.459 --> 00:01:28.170 
I'll knit a stitch and slip as if to
purl<00:01:23.619> with<00:01:24.619> yarn<00:01:25.039> and<00:01:25.520> back

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:28.180 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:30.720 

stitch<00:01:28.570> to<00:01:28.870> end<00:01:28.900> it<00:01:29.320> and<00:01:29.680> then<00:01:30.610> I'll

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:30.730 
stitch to end it and then I'll

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:32.820 
stitch to end it and then I'll
demonstrate<00:01:30.970> that<00:01:31.480> when<00:01:31.690> we<00:01:31.870> turn<00:01:32.230> our<00:01:32.260> work

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:32.830 
demonstrate that when we turn our work

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:35.160 
demonstrate that when we turn our work
and<00:01:33.160> we<00:01:33.400> are<00:01:33.430> on<00:01:33.790> the<00:01:34.060> wrong<00:01:34.270> side

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:35.170 
and we are on the wrong side

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:39.660 
and we are on the wrong side
if<00:01:35.290> the<00:01:36.220> pattern<00:01:36.520> says<00:01:37.060> just<00:01:37.990> slip<00:01:38.410> you<00:01:39.280> should

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:39.670 
if the pattern says just slip you should

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:43.560 
if the pattern says just slip you should
slip<00:01:40.600> as<00:01:40.810> if<00:01:40.870> to<00:01:41.260> purl<00:01:41.470> but<00:01:42.460> with<00:01:42.670> your<00:01:42.940> yarn<00:01:43.210> in
