primary that the adjuster shoe sets in

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.330 
primary that the adjuster shoe sets in
and<00:00:24.359> you'll<00:00:24.510> go<00:00:24.689> one<00:00:25.140> go<00:00:25.470> up<00:00:25.619> one<00:00:25.890> at<00:00:26.010> a<00:00:26.099> time

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
and you'll go one go up one at a time

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.740 
and you'll go one go up one at a time
and<00:00:26.630> at<00:00:27.630> each<00:00:27.869> adjustment<00:00:29.330> you<00:00:30.330> know<00:00:30.449> when<00:00:30.660> you

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
and at each adjustment you know when you

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.389 
and at each adjustment you know when you
check<00:00:31.109> your<00:00:31.260> adjustment<00:00:33.649> the<00:00:34.649> higher<00:00:34.890> the

look for the tightest spot in the chain
that<00:01:11.040> that<00:01:11.430> is<00:01:11.580> a<00:01:11.610> method<00:01:12.060> to<00:01:12.150> use<00:01:12.680> but<00:01:13.680> this

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
that that is a method to use but this

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.450 
that that is a method to use but this
method<00:01:14.100> also<00:01:14.340> works<00:01:14.549> just<00:01:14.939> fine<00:01:16.189> all<00:01:17.189> right

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
method also works just fine all right

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:18.890 
method also works just fine all right
now<00:01:17.610> now<00:01:18.210> what<00:01:18.360> we're<00:01:18.450> going<00:01:18.540> to<00:01:18.630> do<00:01:18.720> is<00:01:18.810> we're
