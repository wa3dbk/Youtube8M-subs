00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:03.900 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:07.229 

so<00:04:04.900> I<00:04:04.930> wondered<00:04:05.440> now<00:04:05.470> I<00:04:05.620> wonder<00:04:05.980> what<00:04:06.910> would<00:04:07.060> do

00:04:07.229 --> 00:04:07.239 
so I wondered now I wonder what would do

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:08.849 
so I wondered now I wonder what would do
more<00:04:07.510> damage<00:04:07.569> that<00:04:08.169> you're<00:04:08.319> gouging<00:04:08.410> we<00:04:08.709> can

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:08.859 
more damage that you're gouging we can

00:04:08.859 --> 00:04:10.589 
more damage that you're gouging we can
go<00:04:08.919> for<00:04:09.099> a<00:04:09.129> stab<00:04:09.430> Dragon<00:04:09.849> Claw<00:04:10.000> which<00:04:10.180> is<00:04:10.299> super

00:04:10.589 --> 00:04:10.599 
go for a stab Dragon Claw which is super

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:12.300 
go for a stab Dragon Claw which is super
effective<00:04:11.019> we<00:04:11.650> can<00:04:11.769> go<00:04:11.889> for<00:04:12.040> an<00:04:12.099> earthquake

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:12.310 
effective we can go for an earthquake

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:14.129 
effective we can go for an earthquake
which<00:04:12.819> isn't<00:04:13.000> stab<00:04:13.329> but<00:04:13.510> it<00:04:13.599> is<00:04:13.690> still<00:04:13.870> super

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:14.139 
which isn't stab but it is still super

00:04:14.139 --> 00:04:15.300 
which isn't stab but it is still super
effective<00:04:14.470> because<00:04:14.560> the<00:04:14.739> drug<00:04:14.889> algae<00:04:15.190> is<00:04:15.250> a

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:15.310 
effective because the drug algae is a

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:18.949 
effective because the drug algae is a
poison<00:04:15.669> type<00:04:15.819> or<00:04:16.449> you<00:04:16.870> can<00:04:16.959> go<00:04:17.049> for<00:04:17.229> a<00:04:17.260> return

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:18.959 
poison type or you can go for a return

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:23.760 
poison type or you can go for a return
which<00:04:20.880> gets<00:04:21.880> the<00:04:22.060> pixelate<00:04:22.599> boost

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:23.770 
which gets the pixelate boost

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:25.800 
which gets the pixelate boost
and<00:04:24.340> it's<00:04:24.819> probably<00:04:24.970> stronger<00:04:25.539> because<00:04:25.660> it

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:25.810 
and it's probably stronger because it

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:28.080 
and it's probably stronger because it
goes<00:04:26.080> off<00:04:26.289> of<00:04:26.440> affection<00:04:27.250> or<00:04:27.520> not<00:04:27.669> affecting

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:28.090 
goes off of affection or not affecting

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:31.999 
goes off of affection or not affecting

the happiness what I want to see is

00:04:32.009 --> 00:04:37.529 
the happiness what I want to see is
poison<00:04:33.009> does<00:04:33.190> in<00:04:33.370> fact<00:04:33.520> resist<00:04:35.940> huh<00:04:36.940> I'm<00:04:37.419> gonna
