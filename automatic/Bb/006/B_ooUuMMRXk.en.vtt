00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:05.839
 or the a kina barrillo and today I bring you 

00:00:03.019 --> 00:00:08.390
 another video more of the city I bring you the 

00:00:05.839 --> 00:00:11.390
 discotheque 

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:14.270
 she's beautiful we go here a red factory 

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:16.070
 is going to enter and I go back to the elevator very 

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:18.230
 basic, I do not think there is a lack 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:19.610
 explain just go jumping and then 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:22.640
 you're hooking a water with the 

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:26.750
 Another one so that the water does not fall 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:29.660
 puts a poster and point solved and 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:32.119
 we enter green soil so that for 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:36.000
 it looks pretty and as you see here we have 

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:39.150
 the whole thing a bar 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.140
 we have a bar here and now we have 

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:44.950
 for example over here 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:48.079
 and look, look, look, look, look how 

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:50.629
 they change the roof lions 

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:52.269
 look at the cart that piece to another and it 

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:54.469
 they change all the colors again and 

00:00:52.269 --> 00:00:56.500
 We are celebrating you go around here 

00:00:54.469 --> 00:00:58.540
 party with your colleagues 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:03.130
 it's around parties stepping on the 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:04.720
 other floor plates over here my dad then 

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:07.180
 they were changing the union these times and 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:10.370
 here you play a party that mother 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:14.270
 mine does not look at her look at me Ã¡vila 

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:16.670
 and again and now you will see the mechanism 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:18.560
 how is it we go to the maintenance as 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:21.600
 always and here you will discover a 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:24.150
 plugin that we have installed also 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.909
 it's an elevator plugin be leaf 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:29.810
 call elevator or not the plugin sorry and 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:34.009
 nothing you put here you give the button 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:36.640
 tatxan and you go up flower bastard not yet 

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:36.640
 the day had gone 

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:47.159
 I'm already here and now look look there's 26 

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:51.159
 dotti or why not because I can not fly 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:53.319
 look here you have all the mechanism 

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:55.960
 it's simply the same mechanism that 

00:01:53.319 --> 00:01:58.929
 before in the other video that is taught 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:01.509
 from the library but more sophisticated to 

00:01:58.929 --> 00:02:03.310
 all united, this is what we did 

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:06.520
 afterwards and we discovered it we were 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:07.929
 trying to make it more optimal and 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:10.899
 can put a lot more lights and here is 

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:11.650
 the result and then the paranoia of what 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:13.670
 down 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:15.530
 although you have it 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:17.980
 to all all the squares that 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:21.780
 interconnected among them 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:23.780
 at the same time connect the lights 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:26.810
 it has not taken us long enough 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:29.280
 carry out all of this arrest or 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:32.790
 the truth that we are not very good but 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:36.690
 we like it and we are learning and 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:39.000
 there it is here you have another video more and os 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:40.810
 I leave here with these beautiful views of 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.120
 the whole circuit 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:45.989
 and nothing else we see in another delivery 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.989
 see you later
