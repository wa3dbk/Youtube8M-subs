good<00:04:31.210> for<00:04:31.420> facetime<00:04:32.520> the<00:04:33.520> facetime<00:04:33.970> thing<00:04:34.180> is

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:34.300 
good for facetime the facetime thing is

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:40.080 
good for facetime the facetime thing is
a<00:04:35.040> big<00:04:36.040> upgrade<00:04:38.160> there's<00:04:39.160> pictures<00:04:39.520> you<00:04:39.970> can

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:48.910 
here and then you could switch the

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:51.120 
here and then you could switch the
camera<00:04:49.150> whenever<00:04:49.660> you<00:04:49.930> need<00:04:50.110> and<00:04:50.950> also
