stand mixer to mix this but you can use
a<00:02:14.060> food<00:02:14.330> processor<00:02:14.390> or<00:02:15.370> this<00:02:16.370> type<00:02:16.550> of<00:02:16.580> mixer

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.060 
a food processor or this type of mixer

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:21.040 
a food processor or this type of mixer
and<00:02:17.170> basically<00:02:18.790> just<00:02:19.790> turn<00:02:20.000> it<00:02:20.090> on<00:02:20.209> and<00:02:20.900> kind

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:22.690 
and basically just turn it on and kind
of<00:02:21.140> let<00:02:21.290> it<00:02:21.350> slowly<00:02:21.769> work<00:02:22.160> together<00:02:22.340> it's

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
of let it slowly work together it's

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:24.820 
of let it slowly work together it's
going<00:02:22.819> to<00:02:22.880> see<00:02:23.030> it<00:02:23.209> basically<00:02:23.540> a<00:02:23.660> fumble<00:02:24.290> type

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:24.830
