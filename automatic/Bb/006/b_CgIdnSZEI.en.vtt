00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
and this is pretty much how IQ it's

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.260 
and this is pretty much how IQ it's
actually<00:02:10.800> very<00:02:10.979> easy<00:02:11.100> to<00:02:11.610> queue<00:02:11.819> up<00:02:11.850> so<00:02:12.150> I'll

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
actually very easy to queue up so I'll

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:14.300 
actually very easy to queue up so I'll
just<00:02:12.450> do<00:02:12.569> like<00:02:12.600> one<00:02:13.380> of<00:02:13.530> these<00:02:13.650> two<00:02:14.130> of<00:02:14.220> these

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 
just do like one of these two of these

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:18.830 
just do like one of these two of these
and<00:02:14.640> then<00:02:14.760> I'll<00:02:14.880> do<00:02:15.350> 46<00:02:17.630> archers<00:02:18.630> or

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840

then the next one be 40 if you know what
I<00:02:33.360> mean<00:02:33.450> it's<00:02:33.630> it's<00:02:33.930> interchangeable<00:02:34.200> you<00:02:34.680> can

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 
I mean it's it's interchangeable you can

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.710 
I mean it's it's interchangeable you can
make<00:02:34.920> it<00:02:35.040> to<00:02:35.100> already<00:02:35.280> have<00:02:35.400> more<00:02:35.880> Giants<00:02:36.510> or

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.110 
one actually was good design a lot in my
collectors<00:03:07.709> but<00:03:08.370> just<00:03:08.580> look<00:03:08.760> at<00:03:08.880> all<00:03:09.000> these

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
collectors but just look at all these

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:12.199 
collectors but just look at all these
attacks<00:03:09.480> they<00:03:09.660> only<00:03:09.900> go<00:03:10.230> for<00:03:10.440> the<00:03:10.470> tonal<00:03:11.209> and

00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:12.209

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:13.640 
attacks they only go for the tonal and
it<00:03:12.510> worked<00:03:12.690> really<00:03:12.780> well

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
it worked really well

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:15.560 
it worked really well

so this one is okay look at that there's
all<00:03:36.390> in<00:03:36.540> the<00:03:36.630> collectors<00:03:37.760> but<00:03:38.760> when<00:03:38.910> I<00:03:38.940> see<00:03:39.180> a

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:39.209 
all in the collectors but when I see a

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:42.050 
all in the collectors but when I see a
base<00:03:39.480> like<00:03:39.780> this<00:03:39.810> I<00:03:40.260> have<00:03:40.799> to<00:03:40.950> think<00:03:41.190> am<00:03:41.670> I

like I have now you can drop lightnings

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:15.170 
like I have now you can drop lightnings
on<00:05:12.600> really<00:05:12.960> weak<00:05:13.140> buildings<00:05:13.560> and<00:05:14.030> things<00:05:15.030> will

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:15.180 
on really weak buildings and things will

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:15.890 
on really weak buildings and things will
turn<00:05:15.270> out<00:05:15.330> just<00:05:15.450> fine

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:15.900 
turn out just fine

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:18.400

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:18.410 
so I don't need a deploy anymore I

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:20.660 
so I don't need a deploy anymore I
turned<00:05:19.410> out<00:05:19.530> pretty<00:05:19.590> low<00:05:19.980> so<00:05:20.250> it<00:05:20.430> looks<00:05:20.580> like

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:20.670
