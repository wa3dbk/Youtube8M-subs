00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:12.030
 heat the milk with the pods 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.320
 vanilla from which you can remove the 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.669
 grains to incorporate them 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.669
 directly in the milk 

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:25.470
 the ideal is to infuse the vanilla 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.730
 in the milk for an hour to 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.230
 ambient temperature 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.230
 after bringing the milk to a boil 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:40.360
 while warm milk mix in 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:42.480
 a salad bowl the egg yolks and the 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:42.480
 sugar 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:53.059
 as soon as the milk is boiling you 

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:54.649
 can pass it to Chinese to remove 

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:57.260
 the impurities brought by the Corsican 

00:00:54.649 --> 00:01:00.760
 vanilla pods then add the 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:03.260
 very gradually to the sugar mixture 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:04.250
 if you pay all of the 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:08.200
 yellow shoes 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:08.200
 these are going to cook and coagulated 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:21.710
 you can now return the whole thing 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:24.470
 in the pan and will heat again 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:26.180
 on a soft fire the difficulty with the 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:27.740
 custard and cook 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:30.350
 just enough so that she did not have the 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:33.560
 spoon but not too much not to do 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:35.840
 cook the yolks 2 you have to mix the 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:37.340
 cream during cooking because otherwise she 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:39.620
 will only take it to the bottom of the pan 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:41.570
 and be careful not to do it 

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:43.520
 boil 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:45.620
 as soon as the cream thickens you can 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:47.780
 stop cooking if you find it 

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:49.810
 still too much liquid that's normal she's going 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:52.130
 thicken a little while cooling 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:54.229
 custard accompanies very well 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:56.600
 a chocolate cake or eggs to the 

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:59.830
 snow that you can achieve with the 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:59.830
 whites unused eggs
