00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:21.330
 so who 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:24.720
 installing an indicator of 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:27.289
 committed report the hymn djipro the 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:30.359
 specific models of kawasaki 

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:35.340
 the installation is quite simple there 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:39.899
 just disassemble some vices ones 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:47.539
 have removed the river that are found 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:52.010
 here with a screwdriver removed Saturday 6 6 

00:00:47.539 --> 00:00:56.719
 then this one for easy access 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:56.719
 to the bowels of the kawa 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:02.699
 I chose to pass the thread under 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:08.310
 this plastic piece that we can 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:11.210
 disassemble by removing seven eclipse screws 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:13.850
 the whole is past the son behind 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:18.320
 this piece 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:22.200
 the son will come out under the wind look 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:27.479
 and we can go back under the saddle of this 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:29.930
 side cable and pass that party and 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:33.810
 so we learned this diagnosis 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:35.909
 that of climbs this one has it and the 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.970
 little life if to rock a little bit 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:41.820
 the bottom cover and finally move 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:46.649
 properly the business that is going to be related to the 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:49.770
 taking a gnostic of the bike it takes 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:54.799
 quarter of an hour twenty minutes time 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:54.799
 to choose your path 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:05.140
 and then because everything is fine 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:05.140
 plugged in by turning on the bike 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:16.370
 we can see the figures of 0.6 and then 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:20.240
 come back 0.20 for this model none 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:21.310
 calibration case the installation was 

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:24.500
 direct 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:26.420
 there was no need to do 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:32.270
 notifications the indications that one 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:34.820
 done on the little booklet provided so 

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:39.860
 it works well until the sixth 

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:40.900
 report obviously on this model this is 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:44.900
 very convenient 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:47.500
 I recommend it to all that avoids the 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:47.500
 search at 7th 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:51.640
