00:00:11.489 --> 00:00:14.489
 there h 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:18.949
 to come to a knife customer today would like to show it really well 

00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:20.310
 to cut 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:25.080
 we are doing a Japanese aperto today is a market with salmon and what said 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.480
 It goes directly with the little knife my favorite topic when 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:30.759
 He knows goals from home 

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:34.820
 bavarian pretty often schultes often a blunt knife and the wrong 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:36.230
 Announce technique 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:39.990
 small knife Paul for this Ceylan Rand can definitely hand 

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:43.210
 In between Apcom I can be offered on the vegan ground 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:47.590
 important when cutting with a small knife to better put on the hand 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:51.420
 and also snow not go down basic structure the work path then seemed 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.700
 The juice does not come out and I have to cry for that and also one 

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:59.830
 Cut motion a small Ackermann Chrissie Wellington sale and has 

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:05.129
 thus a better halt unplanned back Sochi prepared up to far 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:09.300
 for larger, the beginning of the previous day will continue to rise 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:10.860
 love me a little bit easier 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.810
 but now to sign for the throws of the doctors to Klein which means 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:16.110
 want to swap 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.500
 against a chef's knife on advantage of the chef's knife to a mishap my 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.640
 Hand perched here has accordingly a nice movement to come not 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.650
 on hand from Prato comes the Klinger on the board 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.090
 and I can support myself at the front meant to climb in the back 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:35.810
 Area look ahead for whom my hand is going on and can start now 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:38.790
 because of love because of either Thorner 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.470
 or backwards I can not push so well but better forward 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:44.000
 and so dashing 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.270
 my onions in fine cubes 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:49.619
 A classic on this subject is also the topic chives evil tongues 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:52.220
 also say price red-red or mercury hose 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:54.130
 he really needs to be cut 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:57.660
 Every host should show better you should only be in this area 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:01.289
 If I'm too far forward now, the surveyors would not move much 

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:03.619
 move so far so really go back 

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:06.610
 at this area as close as possible to that together 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:09.829
 and that's what the seamstress is still after 

00:02:09.829 --> 00:02:14.029
 in front and Wanderer it succeeded then with the hand back important again 

00:02:14.029 --> 00:02:17.629
 sharp otherwise you can turn that the herbs hackers and then it will 

00:02:17.629 --> 00:02:20.599
 To be fat again that means really nice cut 

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:23.799
 then the sign has given for my party can 

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:27.689
 Here I have a knife with cool because Poland means you can already see 

00:02:27.689 --> 00:02:31.959
 that they are small depressions by deepening it is one less seller 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:35.950
 Friction that is known from Kieser knives Allnoch overlap from the cut 

00:02:35.949 --> 00:02:40.259
 Do not like him technology many investors on the side and in turn start that 

00:02:40.259 --> 00:02:44.900
 Whole by sliding in fine strips Chrome again fold his life 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:48.479
 back the back area and then finely dice the cool ones 

00:02:48.479 --> 00:02:50.709
 small the whole better 

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:51.760
 then he clarified 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:55.900
 OM Saartoto even prepared two ingredients that have ever been used by the community 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:56.949
 Bowl 

00:02:56.949 --> 00:02:59.839
 What we have now, of course, lax the salmon too far from the preparer 

00:02:59.839 --> 00:03:02.279
 speaks fried and spiced 

00:03:02.279 --> 00:03:06.519
 Problem that everyone knows that the parishes and very unstable to cut 

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:10.569
 the MusikWoche respects their industries long knife for the beautiful cuts 

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:14.420
 Young cattle are pretty slim that means show up now and here 

00:03:14.419 --> 00:03:16.489
 also really pull out 

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:17.759
 and 7 

00:03:17.759 --> 00:03:20.870
 7 and pull and so I come without problems 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:23.719
 Kriftel action that looks great 

00:03:23.719 --> 00:03:26.090
 says we'll do that a little bit now 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:27.290
 Soy sauce us 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:28.309
 sesame 

00:03:28.309 --> 00:03:31.779
 I found that the first thing to do on the publishers 

00:03:32.359 --> 00:03:34.739
 and that's where we put ours 

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:39.749
 At the end of the day, Laux will lose a little bit with that 

00:03:39.749 --> 00:03:41.179
 Serbia 

00:03:41.179 --> 00:03:43.139
 and a bit 

00:03:43.139 --> 00:03:44.049
 Taiwan lie
