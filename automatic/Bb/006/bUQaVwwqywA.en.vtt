now<00:00:00.450> the<00:00:00.539> final<00:00:01.079> round<00:00:01.110> here<00:00:01.560> is<00:00:01.650> just<00:00:01.829> a

00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:01.890 
now the final round here is just a

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:04.579 
now the final round here is just a
formality<00:00:02.280> as<00:00:02.730> I've<00:00:02.909> clearly<00:00:03.629> already<00:00:04.380> broken

00:00:04.579 --> 00:00:04.589 
formality as I've clearly already broken

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:07.730 
formality as I've clearly already broken
the<00:00:04.770> world<00:00:04.920> record<00:00:05.339> so<00:00:06.200> really<00:00:07.200> what<00:00:07.379> else<00:00:07.529> can

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:07.740 
the world record so really what else can

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.610 
the world record so really what else can
I<00:00:07.830> possibly<00:00:08.130> do<00:00:08.790> here<00:00:09.210> build<00:00:10.019> up<00:00:10.170> my<00:00:10.290> speed

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620 
I possibly do here build up my speed

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:12.080 
I possibly do here build up my speed
which<00:00:10.950> my<00:00:11.190> finger<00:00:11.490> is<00:00:11.550> killing<00:00:11.820> me<00:00:11.910> at<00:00:12.000> this

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
which my finger is killing me at this

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:13.190 
which my finger is killing me at this
point<00:00:12.330> so<00:00:12.450> it's<00:00:12.540> not<00:00:12.630> gonna<00:00:12.750> probably<00:00:12.929> be<00:00:13.139> as

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
point so it's not gonna probably be as

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.120 
point so it's not gonna probably be as
powerful<00:00:13.460> see<00:00:14.460> if<00:00:14.549> I<00:00:14.610> can<00:00:14.700> get<00:00:14.820> up<00:00:14.969> and<00:00:16.130> just

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
of his head which will cause him to go

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.359 
of his head which will cause him to go
into<00:01:05.939> a<00:01:05.970> turbo<00:01:06.750> mode<00:01:07.020> and<00:01:07.350> start<00:01:07.920> you<00:01:08.280> know

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
into a turbo mode and start you know

into a turbo mode and start you know
getting<00:01:08.400> him<00:01:08.820> to<00:01:09.090> fly<00:01:09.659> very<00:01:10.080> quickly<00:01:11.090> over<00:01:12.090> in

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.160 
getting him to fly very quickly over in
every<00:01:12.869> single<00:01:13.140> obstacle<00:01:13.650> so<00:01:14.600> yeah<00:01:15.600> it<00:01:15.869> ends<00:01:16.110> up

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
every single obstacle so yeah it ends up

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.320 
every single obstacle so yeah it ends up
being<00:01:16.380> a<00:01:16.530> pretty<00:01:16.830> easy<00:01:17.100> race<00:01:17.520> once<00:01:17.850> I<00:01:18.060> was<00:01:18.210> able

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
being a pretty easy race once I was able

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.300 
being a pretty easy race once I was able
to<00:01:18.479> figure<00:01:18.630> out<00:01:18.869> that<00:01:19.650> I<00:01:19.710> guess<00:01:20.040> for<00:01:20.280> some

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
to figure out that I guess for some

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:21.980 
to figure out that I guess for some
reason<00:01:20.700> as<00:01:20.790> a<00:01:20.820> kid<00:01:21.030> I<00:01:21.060> just<00:01:21.150> didn't<00:01:21.689> get<00:01:21.869> that

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
reason as a kid I just didn't get that

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.490 
reason as a kid I just didn't get that
concept<00:01:22.500> but<00:01:22.710> either<00:01:22.920> way<00:01:23.840> you<00:01:24.840> get<00:01:24.960> him<00:01:25.080> going

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
concept but either way you get him going

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.620 
concept but either way you get him going
he<00:01:25.770> runs<00:01:26.040> uncontrollably<00:01:27.000> as<00:01:27.210> you<00:01:27.299> can<00:01:27.450> see

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
he runs uncontrollably as you can see

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.649 
he runs uncontrollably as you can see
has<00:01:27.960> I<00:01:27.990> just<00:01:28.259> tripped<00:01:28.680> and<00:01:29.009> st.<00:01:29.759> Grunk<00:01:30.060> flying

trying to rub the sticks together to get
sparks<00:02:36.120> going<00:02:36.360> my<00:02:37.320> strategy<00:02:37.830> is<00:02:38.040> to<00:02:38.070> if<00:02:38.580> the

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:38.850 
sparks going my strategy is to if the

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:40.100 
sparks going my strategy is to if the
opponent<00:02:39.240> goes<00:02:39.330> for<00:02:39.630> of<00:02:39.720> course<00:02:39.750> you're<00:02:39.960> going

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
opponent goes for of course you're going

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:42.770 
opponent goes for of course you're going
to<00:02:40.170> start<00:02:40.560> duck<00:02:41.160> down<00:02:41.400> by<00:02:41.730> which<00:02:42.090> is<00:02:42.210> also<00:02:42.480> what

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
to start duck down by which is also what

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:44.060 
to start duck down by which is also what
you<00:02:42.870> need<00:02:42.990> to<00:02:43.050> do<00:02:43.170> in<00:02:43.290> order<00:02:43.440> to<00:02:43.560> start<00:02:43.830> blowing

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:44.070 
you need to do in order to start blowing

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:46.340 
you need to do in order to start blowing
on<00:02:44.430> through<00:02:45.150> these<00:02:45.330> sparks<00:02:45.840> that<00:02:45.930> are<00:02:46.050> slowly

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:46.350 
on through these sparks that are slowly

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:49.340 
on through these sparks that are slowly
starting<00:02:46.560> to<00:02:46.950> build<00:02:47.070> up<00:02:47.510> over<00:02:48.510> on<00:02:48.930> the<00:02:49.080> fire

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.350 
starting to build up over on the fire

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:52.040 
starting to build up over on the fire
once<00:02:50.250> you<00:02:50.400> get<00:02:50.550> the<00:02:50.640> fire<00:02:50.850> going<00:02:50.880> though<00:02:51.480> you

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:52.050 
once you get the fire going though you

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:53.570 
once you get the fire going though you
just<00:02:52.230> have<00:02:52.350> to<00:02:52.470> focus<00:02:52.680> on<00:02:52.980> actually<00:02:53.400> just

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:53.580

always your opponent seemingly knocks
you<00:04:34.980> back<00:04:35.010> quickly<00:04:35.610> but<00:04:36.510> once<00:04:37.230> you<00:04:37.350> go<00:04:37.710> up<00:04:37.860> to

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:38.010 
you back quickly but once you go up to

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:39.650 
you back quickly but once you go up to
him<00:04:38.160> if<00:04:38.250> you<00:04:38.400> actually<00:04:38.700> pressed<00:04:38.940> me<00:04:39.150> Amy

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:39.660 
him if you actually pressed me Amy

him if you actually pressed me Amy
buttons<00:04:39.960> together<00:04:40.260> you<00:04:40.890> can<00:04:41.070> usually<00:04:41.280> do<00:04:41.910> an

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:42.030 
buttons together you can usually do an

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:44.420 
buttons together you can usually do an
elbow<00:04:42.450> that<00:04:42.480> knocked<00:04:43.050> him<00:04:43.470> back<00:04:43.500> instead<00:04:44.130> as

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:44.430 
elbow that knocked him back instead as

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:46.700 
elbow that knocked him back instead as
you<00:04:45.210> saw<00:04:45.390> he<00:04:45.570> already<00:04:45.840> got<00:04:46.080> eaten<00:04:46.500> by<00:04:46.650> the

you saw he already got eaten by the

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:49.160 
you saw he already got eaten by the
saber-toothed<00:04:47.250> tiger<00:04:47.610> I<00:04:47.640> guess<00:04:48.000> clunk<00:04:48.390> can

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:49.170 
saber-toothed tiger I guess clunk can

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:51.860 
saber-toothed tiger I guess clunk can
survive<00:04:49.650> you<00:04:50.190> know<00:04:50.400> you<00:04:50.940> know<00:04:51.030> two<00:04:51.090> falls<00:04:51.570> off

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:51.870 
survive you know you know two falls off

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:53.630 
survive you know you know two falls off
of<00:04:51.900> a<00:04:52.110> giant<00:04:52.320> cliff<00:04:52.680> but<00:04:52.980> he<00:04:53.100> can't<00:04:53.340> survive

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:53.640 
of a giant cliff but he can't survive

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:55.810 
of a giant cliff but he can't survive
being<00:04:53.970> eaten<00:04:54.180> by<00:04:54.270> a<00:04:54.300> signature<00:04:54.660> tiger

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:55.820 
being eaten by a signature tiger

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:58.040 
being eaten by a signature tiger
my<00:04:56.820> guess<00:04:57.060> is<00:04:57.090> though<00:04:57.420> he's<00:04:57.630> still<00:04:57.780> on<00:04:58.020> the

00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:58.050 
my guess is though he's still on the

00:04:58.050 --> 00:04:59.510 
my guess is though he's still on the
inside<00:04:58.500> of<00:04:58.530> that<00:04:58.650> tiger<00:04:59.070> and<00:04:59.220> he<00:04:59.340> will

00:04:59.510 --> 00:04:59.520 
inside of that tiger and he will

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:02.120 
inside of that tiger and he will
eventually<00:04:59.610> burst<00:05:00.210> out<00:05:00.480> of<00:05:00.630> it<00:05:00.780> and<00:05:00.960> face<00:05:01.920> me

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:02.130 
eventually burst out of it and face me

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:04.640 
eventually burst out of it and face me
again<00:05:02.780> but<00:05:03.780> we<00:05:03.930> won't<00:05:04.110> get<00:05:04.170> to<00:05:04.290> see<00:05:04.440> that

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:04.650 
again but we won't get to see that

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:07.340 
again but we won't get to see that
because<00:05:04.980> I'm<00:05:05.310> running<00:05:05.910> and<00:05:06.210> this<00:05:06.960> Tigers

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:07.350 
because I'm running and this Tigers

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:09.110 
because I'm running and this Tigers
chasing<00:05:07.740> me<00:05:07.890> it's<00:05:08.310> pretty<00:05:08.520> simple<00:05:08.880> event

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:09.120 
chasing me it's pretty simple event

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:10.190 
chasing me it's pretty simple event
especially<00:05:09.240> after<00:05:09.660> you've<00:05:09.810> already<00:05:09.900> knocked

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:10.200 
especially after you've already knocked

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:12.110 
especially after you've already knocked
your<00:05:10.440> opponent<00:05:10.860> and<00:05:11.070> he's<00:05:11.460> eliminated<00:05:12.030> from

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:12.120 
your opponent and he's eliminated from

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:14.660 
your opponent and he's eliminated from
the<00:05:12.300> event<00:05:12.570> you<00:05:13.200> make<00:05:13.380> it<00:05:13.500> to<00:05:13.620> a<00:05:13.650> tree<00:05:14.010> you

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:14.670 
the event you make it to a tree you

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:16.220 
the event you make it to a tree you
climb<00:05:14.970> up<00:05:15.000> the<00:05:15.180> tree<00:05:15.450> you<00:05:15.600> started<00:05:15.960> the<00:05:16.020> wave

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:16.230 
climb up the tree you started the wave

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:19.280 
climb up the tree you started the wave
Tigers<00:05:17.010> not<00:05:17.190> quite<00:05:17.460> there<00:05:17.640> yet<00:05:17.870> you<00:05:18.870> wave<00:05:19.080> at

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:19.290 
Tigers not quite there yet you wave at

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:21.830 
Tigers not quite there yet you wave at
the<00:05:19.410> tiger<00:05:19.800> Tiger<00:05:20.670> is<00:05:20.970> probably<00:05:21.600> gonna<00:05:21.720> get

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:21.840 
the tiger Tiger is probably gonna get

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:23.330 
the tiger Tiger is probably gonna get
pretty<00:05:22.170> ticked<00:05:22.470> off<00:05:22.650> and<00:05:22.890> you<00:05:23.010> think<00:05:23.040> that

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:23.340 
pretty ticked off and you think that

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:25.310 
pretty ticked off and you think that
tiger<00:05:23.610> will<00:05:23.730> somehow<00:05:23.880> be<00:05:24.120> able<00:05:24.330> to<00:05:24.450> reach<00:05:25.080> me

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:25.320 
tiger will somehow be able to reach me

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:26.630 
tiger will somehow be able to reach me
still<00:05:25.590> even<00:05:25.860> you<00:05:25.980> know<00:05:26.160> when<00:05:26.370> you<00:05:26.430> think<00:05:26.580> about

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:26.640 
still even you know when you think about

it bestowed upon his hind legs you're

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:29.600 
it bestowed upon his hind legs you're
probably<00:05:28.320> still<00:05:28.560> reach<00:05:28.770> that<00:05:28.950> top<00:05:29.160> branch<00:05:29.430> I'm

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:29.610 
probably still reach that top branch I'm

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:33.110
