this is that the heating is done

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:01.020 
this is that the heating is done
differently<00:01:59.469> there's<00:02:00.159> on<00:02:00.250> a<00:02:00.280> different<00:02:00.640> scale

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:01.030 
differently there's on a different scale

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:03.899 
differently there's on a different scale
which<00:02:01.509> is<00:02:01.540> kind<00:02:01.869> of<00:02:01.960> weird<00:02:02.170> I<00:02:02.799> don't<00:02:03.250> like<00:02:03.670> that

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:03.909 
which is kind of weird I don't like that

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:06.630 
which is kind of weird I don't like that
when<00:02:04.090> you're<00:02:04.240> using<00:02:04.420> the<00:02:04.869> dial<00:02:05.680> it's<00:02:06.399> the<00:02:06.460> same

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:06.640 
when you're using the dial it's the same

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:07.770 
when you're using the dial it's the same
thing<00:02:06.789> with<00:02:06.880> the<00:02:06.969> other<00:02:07.060> side<00:02:07.360> iron<00:02:07.539> but<00:02:07.750> I

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:07.780 
thing with the other side iron but I

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:09.509 
thing with the other side iron but I
don't<00:02:08.049> this<00:02:08.259> is<00:02:08.410> just<00:02:08.560> a<00:02:08.619> general<00:02:08.920> complaint<00:02:09.100> I

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:09.519 
don't this is just a general complaint I

00:02:09.519 --> 00:02:10.889 
don't this is just a general complaint I
don't<00:02:09.940> like<00:02:10.149> that<00:02:10.269> when<00:02:10.390> you're<00:02:10.509> using<00:02:10.600> the

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:10.899 
don't like that when you're using the

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:12.900 
don't like that when you're using the
dial<00:02:11.170> it's<00:02:11.500> not<00:02:11.680> clear<00:02:12.070> enough<00:02:12.160> clearly

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910 
dial it's not clear enough clearly

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:14.850 
dial it's not clear enough clearly
with<00:02:13.090> the<00:02:13.180> numbers<00:02:13.510> because<00:02:13.930> if<00:02:14.170> let's<00:02:14.740> say<00:02:14.800> a

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:14.860 
with the numbers because if let's say a

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:16.860 
with the numbers because if let's say a
friend<00:02:15.070> uses<00:02:15.490> it<00:02:15.610> or<00:02:15.790> you<00:02:16.000> put<00:02:16.420> it<00:02:16.480> in<00:02:16.570> your<00:02:16.690> bag

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:16.870 
friend uses it or you put it in your bag

friend uses it or you put it in your bag
and<00:02:16.900> some<00:02:17.230> an<00:02:17.350> excellent<00:02:17.710> turnstile<00:02:18.190> you

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 
and some an excellent turnstile you

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:19.980 
and some an excellent turnstile you
don't<00:02:18.880> know<00:02:19.000> exactly<00:02:19.120> what<00:02:19.570> he<00:02:19.690> even

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:19.990 
don't know exactly what he even

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:21.330 
don't know exactly what he even
straightening<00:02:20.320> your<00:02:20.410> hair<00:02:20.470> and<00:02:20.860> like<00:02:20.950> for<00:02:21.160> you

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:25.690 
I'll try to show you if you see mine is

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:28.290 
I'll try to show you if you see mine is
somewhere<00:02:26.080> in<00:02:26.200> between<00:02:26.320> 20<00:02:26.860> and<00:02:26.890> 25<00:02:27.460> I<00:02:27.880> don't

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:28.300 
somewhere in between 20 and 25 I don't

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:29.610 
somewhere in between 20 and 25 I don't
know<00:02:28.450> I<00:02:28.630> mean<00:02:28.750> you<00:02:29.020> would<00:02:29.140> guess<00:02:29.350> it<00:02:29.470> that's

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.620 
know I mean you would guess it that's

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:31.710 
know I mean you would guess it that's
like<00:02:29.740> 23<00:02:30.280> but<00:02:30.760> if<00:02:30.850> I<00:02:30.910> turn<00:02:30.970> it<00:02:31.240> slightly<00:02:31.420> to<00:02:31.690> the

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720 
like 23 but if I turn it slightly to the

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:36.450 
like 23 but if I turn it slightly to the
right<00:02:32.610> I'm<00:02:33.610> still<00:02:33.940> not<00:02:34.120> quite<00:02:34.360> 1<00:02:34.720> 25<00:02:35.260> yet<00:02:35.620> so

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:36.460 
right I'm still not quite 1 25 yet so

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:38.760 
right I'm still not quite 1 25 yet so
how<00:02:37.120> am<00:02:37.330> I<00:02:37.420> supposed<00:02:37.780> to<00:02:37.870> know<00:02:38.140> what<00:02:38.470> he<00:02:38.620> don't

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:38.770 
how am I supposed to know what he don't

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:40.560 
how am I supposed to know what he don't
want<00:02:39.070> I<00:02:39.250> turn<00:02:39.460> it<00:02:39.550> back<00:02:39.580> rub<00:02:39.970> rub<00:02:40.120> my<00:02:40.240> hair<00:02:40.420> off

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:40.570 
want I turn it back rub rub my hair off

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:42.570 
want I turn it back rub rub my hair off
but<00:02:41.140> yes<00:02:41.350> my<00:02:41.530> concern<00:02:41.950> is<00:02:42.100> that<00:02:42.130> I<00:02:42.340> might

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:42.580 
but yes my concern is that I might

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:44.880 
but yes my concern is that I might
potentially<00:02:43.000> go<00:02:43.300> too<00:02:43.450> high<00:02:43.780> one<00:02:44.080> day<00:02:44.320> or<00:02:44.740> go

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:44.890 
potentially go too high one day or go

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:46.440 
potentially go too high one day or go
too<00:02:44.950> low<00:02:45.250> and<00:02:45.400> have<00:02:45.490> to<00:02:45.550> go<00:02:45.670> over<00:02:45.880> over<00:02:46.330> and

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:46.450 
too low and have to go over over and

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:48.270 
too low and have to go over over and
over<00:02:46.750> again<00:02:46.810> wondering<00:02:47.380> why<00:02:47.470> my<00:02:47.620> flat<00:02:47.980> hands

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:48.280 
over again wondering why my flat hands

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:49.950 
over again wondering why my flat hands
not<00:02:48.520> working<00:02:48.790> the<00:02:48.880> same<00:02:49.090> way<00:02:49.120> so<00:02:49.780> it<00:02:49.870> would

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:49.960 
not working the same way so it would

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:50.850 
not working the same way so it would
have<00:02:50.050> been<00:02:50.140> nice<00:02:50.320> if<00:02:50.350> they<00:02:50.590> have<00:02:50.710> been

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:50.860 
have been nice if they have been

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:52.230 
have been nice if they have been
consistent<00:02:51.340> with<00:02:51.430> the<00:02:51.520> numbering<00:02:51.940> and<00:02:52.120> then

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:52.240 
consistent with the numbering and then

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:55.080 
consistent with the numbering and then
also<00:02:52.450> for<00:02:53.260> the<00:02:53.380> dial<00:02:53.620> I<00:02:53.950> mean<00:02:54.370> really<00:02:54.580> it

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:55.090 
also for the dial I mean really it

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:56.760 
also for the dial I mean really it
shouldn't<00:02:55.450> be<00:02:55.540> too<00:02:55.960> hard<00:02:55.990> to<00:02:56.260> just<00:02:56.350> put<00:02:56.650> some

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:56.770 
shouldn't be too hard to just put some

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:58.320 
shouldn't be too hard to just put some
extra<00:02:56.890> numbers<00:02:57.310> on<00:02:57.400> here<00:02:57.550> so<00:02:57.700> we<00:02:57.790> know<00:02:57.880> exactly

00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:58.330 
extra numbers on here so we know exactly

00:02:58.330 --> 00:02:59.490 
extra numbers on here so we know exactly
what<00:02:58.510> number<00:02:58.750> we're<00:02:58.900> using<00:02:59.080> because<00:02:59.320> that

00:02:59.490 --> 00:02:59.500 
what number we're using because that

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:01.770 
what number we're using because that
actually<00:02:59.740> is<00:03:00.070> really<00:03:00.340> super<00:03:01.300> important

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:01.780 
actually is really super important

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:04.320 
actually is really super important
otherwise<00:03:02.470> the<00:03:02.980> flat<00:03:03.160> iron<00:03:03.370> is<00:03:03.610> wonderful<00:03:04.210> I

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:04.330 
otherwise the flat iron is wonderful I

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:06.630
