and Mississippi

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.939

straight<00:00:38.520> on<00:00:38.670> across<00:00:38.970> they<00:00:39.900> used<00:00:40.200> to<00:00:40.379> be<00:00:40.500> that

00:00:40.939 --> 00:00:40.949 
straight on across they used to be that

00:00:40.949 --> 00:00:43.580 
straight on across they used to be that
ships<00:00:41.280> would<00:00:41.610> use<00:00:42.030> sand<00:00:42.510> in<00:00:42.840> the<00:00:42.930> ballast<00:00:43.350> and

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
ships would use sand in the ballast and

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.590 
ships would use sand in the ballast and
the<00:00:44.280> reason<00:00:44.640> they<00:00:44.730> did<00:00:44.910> that<00:00:44.940> was<00:00:45.120> they<00:00:45.420> made

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
the reason they did that was they made

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.119 
the reason they did that was they made
it<00:00:45.720> more<00:00:45.750> effective<00:00:46.470> as<00:00:46.590> they<00:00:46.739> traveled

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
it more effective as they traveled

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:48.350 
it more effective as they traveled
through<00:00:47.159> the<00:00:47.309> sea<00:00:47.580> instead<00:00:47.909> of<00:00:48.030> coming<00:00:48.300> you

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
through the sea instead of coming you

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.299 
through the sea instead of coming you
know<00:00:48.480> they<00:00:48.930> would<00:00:49.110> swap<00:00:49.290> the<00:00:49.500> cargo<00:00:49.890> from

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
know they would swap the cargo from

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.969 
know they would swap the cargo from
cargo<00:00:50.760> to<00:00:50.970> sand<00:00:51.269> any<00:00:51.540> way<00:00:51.720> that<00:00:52.379> sand

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:52.979 
cargo to sand any way that sand

00:00:52.979 --> 00:00:56.329

harvested the fire ant the red important

00:00:56.339 --> 00:00:57.439 
harvested the fire ant the red important
that's<00:00:56.460> why<00:00:56.640> it's<00:00:56.760> actually<00:00:56.879> called<00:00:57.180> a<00:00:57.300> red

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
that's why it's actually called a red

for<00:01:11.790> instance<00:01:12.150> they're<00:01:12.330> not<00:01:12.450> all<00:01:12.630> the<00:01:12.720> way<00:01:12.780> to

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
for instance they're not all the way to

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.300 
for instance they're not all the way to
California<00:01:13.110> yet<00:01:13.680> although<00:01:13.860> I've<00:01:14.130> heard

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
California yet although I've heard

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.310 
California yet although I've heard
they've<00:01:14.520> made<00:01:14.729> it<00:01:14.850> as<00:01:14.970> far<00:01:15.000> as<00:01:15.270> Arizona<00:01:15.600> so

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
they've made it as far as Arizona so

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.320 
they've made it as far as Arizona so
they<00:01:16.920> are<00:01:17.100> moving<00:01:17.549> across<00:01:17.760> in<00:01:18.060> a<00:01:18.120> movement

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
they are moving across in a movement

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.450 
they are moving across in a movement
across<00:01:18.479> pretty<00:01:18.990> fast<00:01:19.289> one<00:01:19.979> thing<00:01:20.189> they<00:01:20.310> don't

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
across pretty fast one thing they don't

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.399 
across pretty fast one thing they don't
tolerate<00:01:20.759> is<00:01:21.210> cold<00:01:21.479> temperature<00:01:21.990> so<00:01:22.380> you

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
tolerate is cold temperature so you

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.350 
tolerate is cold temperature so you
they're<00:01:22.829> not<00:01:22.950> really<00:01:23.250> very<00:01:23.369> far<00:01:23.820> north<00:01:24.060> feel

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
they're not really very far north feel

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.539 
they're not really very far north feel
they've<00:01:24.750> they're<00:01:25.350> up<00:01:25.500> in<00:01:25.619> Kansas<00:01:25.920> but<00:01:26.340> that's

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
they've they're up in Kansas but that's

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:27.289 
they've they're up in Kansas but that's
about<00:01:26.820> it

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
about it

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.810 
about it
the<00:01:28.020> red<00:01:28.200> imported<00:01:28.500> fire<00:01:28.710> ants<00:01:29.189> are<00:01:29.280> dangerous

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
the red imported fire ants are dangerous

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.240 
the red imported fire ants are dangerous
because<00:01:30.180> they<00:01:30.630> can<00:01:31.320> actually<00:01:31.649> form

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
because they can actually form

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:33.920 
because they can actually form
there's<00:01:32.700> many<00:01:33.030> instances<00:01:33.600> where<00:01:33.810> they've

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
there's many instances where they've

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.660 
there's many instances where they've
killed<00:01:34.170> the<00:01:34.350> elderly<00:01:34.859> and<00:01:35.159> they've<00:01:35.399> killed

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670

young infants as well the fire ants

00:01:37.859 --> 00:01:40.340 
young infants as well the fire ants
themselves<00:01:38.609> are<00:01:38.820> actually<00:01:39.450> easy<00:01:39.840> to<00:01:40.049> control

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
themselves are actually easy to control

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.219 
themselves are actually easy to control
nowadays<00:01:40.979> they<00:01:41.729> just<00:01:41.969> you<00:01:42.299> know<00:01:42.420> just<00:01:42.689> have<00:01:43.140> to

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.450 
not like most people think most people

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:34.750 
not like most people think most people

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:34.760 
think that crawl from one property to

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:36.280 
think that crawl from one property to
the<00:02:34.940> other<00:02:35.060> la<00:02:35.240> that<00:02:35.450> can<00:02:35.600> happen<00:02:35.990> that's<00:02:36.110> not

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:36.290 
the other la that can happen that's not

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:39.040 
the other la that can happen that's not
actually<00:02:36.920> the<00:02:37.070> most<00:02:37.250> common<00:02:37.700> way<00:02:37.880> the<00:02:38.660> Queens

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:39.050 
actually the most common way the Queens

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:43.090 
actually the most common way the Queens
can<00:02:39.440> fly<00:02:39.710> so<00:02:40.640> what<00:02:41.450> happens<00:02:41.930> is<00:02:42.170> that<00:02:42.440> and<00:02:42.860> one

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:43.100 
can fly so what happens is that and one

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:45.070 
can fly so what happens is that and one
colony<00:02:43.460> can<00:02:43.640> have<00:02:43.820> multiple<00:02:44.180> Queens<00:02:44.660> as<00:02:44.870> well

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:45.080 
colony can have multiple Queens as well

colony can have multiple Queens as well
what<00:02:45.740> happens<00:02:46.160> is<00:02:46.370> the<00:02:46.550> Queen<00:02:46.790> will<00:02:47.030> fly

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:47.300 
what happens is the Queen will fly

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:50.560 
what happens is the Queen will fly
already<00:02:48.050> impregnated<00:02:48.800> in<00:02:49.400> the<00:02:49.550> air<00:02:49.700> with<00:02:50.540> a

male the male drops dead is it all in

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:55.540 
male the male drops dead is it all in
the<00:02:53.600> insect<00:02:54.080> Kingdom<00:02:54.350> as<00:02:54.650> that<00:02:54.800> often<00:02:55.160> happens

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:55.550 
the insect Kingdom as that often happens

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:59.410 
the insect Kingdom as that often happens
the<00:02:56.350> female<00:02:57.350> will<00:02:57.560> land<00:02:57.800> pregnant<00:02:58.550> she'll<00:02:59.150> lay

00:02:59.410 --> 00:02:59.420 
the female will land pregnant she'll lay

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:02.740 
the female will land pregnant she'll lay
her<00:02:59.660> eggs<00:02:59.900> and<00:03:00.880> another<00:03:01.880> colony<00:03:02.240> will<00:03:02.450> start

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:02.750 
her eggs and another colony will start

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:05.950 
her eggs and another colony will start
that's<00:03:03.740> one<00:03:04.670> of<00:03:04.760> the<00:03:04.820> biggest<00:03:05.030> problems<00:03:05.810> with

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:05.960 
that's one of the biggest problems with

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:07.510 
that's one of the biggest problems with
top<00:03:06.200> choices<00:03:06.500> it<00:03:06.860> takes<00:03:07.070> a<00:03:07.190> couple<00:03:07.340> of<00:03:07.460> weeks

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:07.520 
top choices it takes a couple of weeks

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:10.650 
top choices it takes a couple of weeks
for<00:03:07.850> it<00:03:07.910> to<00:03:08.000> work<00:03:08.270> and<00:03:08.600> so<00:03:08.810> oftentimes<00:03:09.260> clients

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:10.660 
for it to work and so oftentimes clients

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:12.970 
for it to work and so oftentimes clients
think<00:03:11.660> that<00:03:11.900> it<00:03:12.050> didn't<00:03:12.350> work<00:03:12.470> because<00:03:12.620> of<00:03:12.860> a

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:12.980 
think that it didn't work because of a

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:15.340 
think that it didn't work because of a
firing<00:03:13.370> mound<00:03:13.610> to<00:03:13.730> pop<00:03:13.910> up<00:03:14.120> it's<00:03:14.870> not<00:03:15.050> that<00:03:15.260> it

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:15.350 
firing mound to pop up it's not that it

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:17.830 
firing mound to pop up it's not that it
didn't<00:03:15.770> work<00:03:15.980> it's<00:03:16.250> that<00:03:16.340> that<00:03:16.910> Queen<00:03:17.420> laid

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:17.840 
didn't work it's that that Queen laid

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:21.010 
didn't work it's that that Queen laid
her<00:03:18.200> eggs<00:03:18.440> and<00:03:18.980> it's<00:03:19.220> and<00:03:19.760> they<00:03:20.390> hatched<00:03:20.600> and

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:21.020 
her eggs and it's and they hatched and

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:22.870 
her eggs and it's and they hatched and
so<00:03:21.140> that<00:03:21.290> new<00:03:21.470> colony<00:03:22.280> was<00:03:22.400> allowed<00:03:22.670> just

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:22.880 
so that new colony was allowed just

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:25.030 
so that new colony was allowed just
allowed<00:03:23.330> to<00:03:23.480> start<00:03:23.780> now<00:03:24.410> the<00:03:24.500> way<00:03:24.680> the<00:03:24.860> newer

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:25.040 
allowed to start now the way the newer

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:26.590 
allowed to start now the way the newer
technology<00:03:25.790> and<00:03:25.940> some<00:03:26.120> of<00:03:26.210> these<00:03:26.300> newer

technology and some of these newer
pesticides<00:03:27.350> work<00:03:27.920> is<00:03:28.250> they<00:03:28.940> attack<00:03:29.330> a

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:29.630 
pesticides work is they attack a

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:32.470 
pesticides work is they attack a
specific<00:03:30.440> characteristic<00:03:31.070> of<00:03:31.670> a<00:03:31.820> specific

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:32.480 
specific characteristic of a specific

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:35.110 
specific characteristic of a specific
insect<00:03:33.170> in<00:03:33.890> other<00:03:34.070> words<00:03:34.340> that's<00:03:34.610> why<00:03:34.820> we<00:03:34.970> can

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:35.120 
insect in other words that's why we can

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:36.970 
insect in other words that's why we can
use<00:03:35.240> fipronil<00:03:35.720> on<00:03:35.870> our<00:03:35.990> pets<00:03:36.230> with<00:03:36.470> no<00:03:36.620> worries

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:36.980 
use fipronil on our pets with no worries

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:40.180 
use fipronil on our pets with no worries
is<00:03:37.220> because<00:03:37.930> it<00:03:38.930> attacks<00:03:39.320> a<00:03:39.530> neuro<00:03:39.740> receptor

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:40.190 
is because it attacks a neuro receptor

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:43.180 
is because it attacks a neuro receptor
that's<00:03:40.310> not<00:03:40.520> present<00:03:41.210> in<00:03:41.270> mammals<00:03:41.780> so<00:03:42.170> the<00:03:42.920> in

would come into contact and it would

would come into contact and it would
actually<00:04:04.190> just<00:04:04.370> kill<00:04:04.670> those<00:04:04.880> worker<00:04:05.420> ants<00:04:05.840> the

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:06.020 
actually just kill those worker ants the

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:08.260 
actually just kill those worker ants the
way<00:04:06.140> the<00:04:06.320> top<00:04:06.530> choice<00:04:06.830> works<00:04:07.220> is<00:04:07.760> kind<00:04:08.060> of<00:04:08.150> a

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:08.270 
way the top choice works is kind of a

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:11.110 
way the top choice works is kind of a
domino<00:04:08.690> effect<00:04:08.720> the<00:04:09.410> workers<00:04:09.770> will<00:04:10.160> come<00:04:10.970> into

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:11.120 
domino effect the workers will come into

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:13.060 
domino effect the workers will come into
contact<00:04:11.390> with<00:04:11.720> the<00:04:11.900> product<00:04:12.320> they'll<00:04:12.770> bring

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:13.070 
contact with the product they'll bring

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:16.690 
contact with the product they'll bring
it<00:04:13.250> back<00:04:13.459> to<00:04:13.820> the<00:04:14.120> mound<00:04:14.600> to<00:04:15.410> the<00:04:15.950> colony<00:04:16.489> and

it back to the mound to the colony and

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:18.910 
it back to the mound to the colony and
then<00:04:17.270> because<00:04:17.690> ants<00:04:18.140> are<00:04:18.320> actually<00:04:18.590> very<00:04:18.830> very

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:18.920 
then because ants are actually very very

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:21.220 
then because ants are actually very very
clean<00:04:19.549> they<00:04:19.580> groom<00:04:20.060> themselves<00:04:20.330> they'll

clean they groom themselves they'll

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:23.410 
clean they groom themselves they'll

spread it through that whole colony and

that delay that several week delay was

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:30.190 
that delay that several week delay was
intentional<00:04:28.610> it's<00:04:28.880> so<00:04:29.240> that<00:04:29.510> it<00:04:29.840> can<00:04:30.020> spread

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:30.200 
intentional it's so that it can spread

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:32.920 
intentional it's so that it can spread
entirely<00:04:30.920> through<00:04:31.580> the<00:04:31.610> whole<00:04:32.000> mound<00:04:32.510> and
