00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:30.690 
we're going we could work with it but
for<00:01:27.760> me<00:01:27.850> there's<00:01:28.030> a<00:01:28.090> couple<00:01:28.240> of<00:01:29.700> directions

for me there's a couple of directions
that<00:01:30.820> I<00:01:30.850> think<00:01:31.060> would<00:01:31.180> work<00:01:31.360> really<00:01:31.570> well

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:31.720 
that I think would work really well

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:33.719 
that I think would work really well
personally<00:01:32.320> because<00:01:32.979> we're<00:01:33.310> looking<00:01:33.580> to

personally because we're looking to
pretty<00:01:33.970> light<00:01:34.149> and<00:01:34.360> then<00:01:34.479> kind<00:01:34.899> of<00:01:35.050> lift<00:01:35.290> out<00:01:35.530> a

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:35.560 
pretty light and then kind of lift out a

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:37.139 
pretty light and then kind of lift out a
bit<00:01:35.890> we<00:01:36.070> could<00:01:36.220> work<00:01:36.430> with<00:01:36.460> the<00:01:36.729> beyond<00:01:36.970> all

00:01:37.139 --> 00:01:37.149 
bit we could work with the beyond all

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:38.550 
bit we could work with the beyond all
three<00:01:37.420> lights<00:01:37.630> which<00:01:37.930> will<00:01:38.110> give<00:01:38.290> us<00:01:38.320> a<00:01:38.530> better
