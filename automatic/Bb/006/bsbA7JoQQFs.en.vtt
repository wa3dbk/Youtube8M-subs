hey guys I'm back with another video and
this<00:00:02.520> is<00:00:02.760> my<00:00:03.060> second<00:00:03.720> time<00:00:04.220> reviewing<00:00:05.220> a<00:00:05.609> pop

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:08.419 
this is my second time reviewing a pop
basic<00:00:06.509> collection<00:00:07.109> and<00:00:07.379> if<00:00:07.980> you<00:00:08.069> haven't<00:00:08.220> in

00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:08.429 
basic collection and if you haven't in

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:10.310 
basic collection and if you haven't in
the<00:00:08.460> first<00:00:08.790> one<00:00:09.000> I<00:00:09.179> will<00:00:09.420> link<00:00:09.599> that<00:00:09.690> for<00:00:10.110> you

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320 
the first one I will link that for you

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.629 
the first one I will link that for you
here<00:00:11.160> but<00:00:11.610> basically<00:00:12.090> pop<00:00:12.780> basic<00:00:13.469> is<00:00:13.980> an

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
here but basically pop basic is an

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:17.779 
here but basically pop basic is an
online<00:00:15.570> website<00:00:15.900> that<00:00:16.590> does<00:00:16.619> I<00:00:17.279> think<00:00:17.609> its

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
online website that does I think its

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:20.810 
online website that does I think its
monthly<00:00:18.359> collections<00:00:19.199> and<00:00:19.500> it's<00:00:20.490> not<00:00:20.789> a

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
monthly collections and it's not a

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.580 
monthly collections and it's not a
subscription<00:00:21.480> service<00:00:21.510> you<00:00:22.050> don't<00:00:22.289> need<00:00:22.439> to

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
subscription service you don't need to

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.310 
subscription service you don't need to
subscribe<00:00:22.890> to<00:00:23.880> purchase<00:00:24.090> the<00:00:24.539> collection<00:00:25.080> but

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
subscribe to purchase the collection but

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:26.950 
subscribe to purchase the collection but
i<00:00:25.500> think<00:00:25.949> it's<00:00:26.099> every<00:00:26.400> month<00:00:26.640> or<00:00:26.849> every

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:26.960 
i think it's every month or every

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:30.200 
i think it's every month or every
specific<00:00:27.960> time<00:00:28.470> frame<00:00:28.800> they<00:00:29.310> come<00:00:29.550> out<00:00:29.699> with<00:00:29.730> a

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
specific time frame they come out with a

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:31.880 
specific time frame they come out with a
new<00:00:30.269> collection<00:00:30.750> which<00:00:31.019> you<00:00:31.170> can<00:00:31.349> purchase<00:00:31.529> if

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
that's already in your wardrobe so hence

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:48.979 
that's already in your wardrobe so hence
the<00:00:45.930> name<00:00:46.079> pop<00:00:46.379> basic<00:00:46.829> so<00:00:47.399> the<00:00:47.879> package<00:00:48.600> comes

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
the name pop basic so the package comes

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:52.670 
the name pop basic so the package comes
in<00:00:49.289> this<00:00:49.559> box<00:00:49.980> and<00:00:50.340> I<00:00:50.579> always<00:00:51.090> love<00:00:51.570> a<00:00:51.809> branded

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680

in this box and I always love a branded
box<00:00:52.890> I<00:00:53.219> think<00:00:53.760> those<00:00:54.329> little<00:00:54.840> details<00:00:55.020> just

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
box I think those little details just

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.950 
box I think those little details just
make<00:00:55.949> a<00:00:55.980> difference<00:00:56.460> so<00:00:57.030> it<00:00:57.210> comes<00:00:57.510> in<00:00:57.690> a<00:00:57.780> box

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
make a difference so it comes in a box

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.979 
make a difference so it comes in a box

it feels really comfortable to wear and
it's<00:01:43.320> also<00:01:43.579> quite<00:01:44.579> a<00:01:44.670> thick<00:01:45.229> material<00:01:46.229> it's

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
it's also quite a thick material it's

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:49.550 
it's also quite a thick material it's
not<00:01:46.619> like<00:01:46.770> super<00:01:47.130> thick<00:01:47.520> but<00:01:47.850> it's<00:01:48.210> not<00:01:48.780> like<00:01:49.200> a

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
not like super thick but it's not like a

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.760 
not like super thick but it's not like a
thin<00:01:50.310> t-shirt<00:01:50.729> material<00:01:51.180> so<00:01:51.960> the<00:01:52.470> quality

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
thin t-shirt material so the quality

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.160 
thin t-shirt material so the quality
feels<00:01:53.369> really<00:01:53.850> nice<00:01:54.119> and<00:01:54.479> it's<00:01:54.750> got<00:01:54.990> an

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
feels really nice and it's got an

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.830 
feels really nice and it's got an
exposed<00:01:55.740> a<00:01:55.950> zipper<00:01:56.250> at<00:01:56.399> the<00:01:56.549> back<00:01:56.790> and<00:01:57.030> a<00:01:57.329> love

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
exposed a zipper at the back and a love

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.069 
exposed a zipper at the back and a love
exposed<00:01:58.439> zipper<00:01:58.829> so<00:01:59.159> I<00:02:00.090> think<00:02:00.299> this<00:02:00.840> is<00:02:01.049> a

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
exposed zipper so I think this is a

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:03.050 
exposed zipper so I think this is a
really<00:02:01.350> nice<00:02:01.530> touch<00:02:01.829> to<00:02:02.130> the<00:02:02.219> dress<00:02:02.460> so<00:02:03.000> you

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
really nice touch to the dress so you

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:07.399 
really nice touch to the dress so you
know<00:02:03.329> just<00:02:03.659> a<00:02:03.869> normal<00:02:04.490> basic<00:02:05.490> dress<00:02:06.060> but<00:02:06.990> you

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
know just a normal basic dress but you

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:09.320 
know just a normal basic dress but you
can<00:02:07.590> style<00:02:07.890> this<00:02:08.190> in<00:02:08.429> so<00:02:08.759> many<00:02:09.000> ways<00:02:09.270> and

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
can style this in so many ways and

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.479 
can style this in so many ways and
