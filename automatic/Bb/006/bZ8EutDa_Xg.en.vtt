00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:07.430
 xstrata more sun air a new reality 

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:09.110
 called the artist of the year with the 

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:11.510
 driving the always smiling 

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:13.160
 mariana fabbiani seconded by nacha 

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:15.950
 guevara line and with respect to the seasoning 

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:17.750
 officiating heartily the program kicked off 

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:19.789
 with some technical problems and 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:21.289
 they were overcome what could not be 

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:23.119
 apparently correct by one side of 

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:25.279
 shame of nacha and the apathy of 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:27.289
 suddenly that is not fixed because the 

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:30.439
 truth is that an actor what he exposes is 

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:33.910
 also the instrument requires a lot 

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:33.910
 courage to be an artist 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:38.430
 here is happening there 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:45.020
 the air 

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:47.230
 talking about excuse me sir is this going 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:47.230
 Live 

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:58.000
 well what I was looking for 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:04.229
 and not the seronda of the malicious jury 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.479
 he did not limit the chacha of the tail of 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:08.220
 this wild animal because it 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:10.320
 accentuated with those hungry for fame who 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.479
 they were presented then keep that 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.040
 nico also contributed his glass granite 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:18.060
 ground 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:21.180
 the nights, ladies and gentlemen 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:24.210
 I have a super offer to offer 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:26.420
 five characters at the price of one 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.420
 body 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:38.700
 tonight do not tell me anything about your 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:41.850
 acting does not make sense for you 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:45.270
 did you think that happened to you in life 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:48.060
 that's why bubba camps was my best 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:51.180
 friend cuba's mom cooked shrimp 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:55.409
 with potatoes shrimp with onion sauce 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:02:00.479
 Rivas and tasty shrimp just 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:02:04.359
 I ask God Canary 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:07.090
 different new anger and know that a 

00:02:04.359 --> 00:02:09.789
 Arming, I'm going to enter this 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:13.030
 conservatory like that my name is me 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:15.970
 I'm in chat and it's just repetitive not 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:20.940
 they disrespected the mentor in the 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:20.940
 you know I will never give you saracatunga 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:27.840
 we can not leave it 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:38.879
 lower the frequency level of 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:38.879
 positional turbulence 

00:02:39.579 --> 00:02:43.349
 I think I'm going to kill you 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:50.860
 and he does not know why he wants me not to be 

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:53.860
 in the house 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:53.860
 ricardito 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:01.760
 this seems to me already too much three things 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:05.580
 that I found very interesting and 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:09.349
 that one kitchens well another one that was 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:09.349
 well and another that goes well 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:14.600
 lift up every day like all 

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:16.370
 inhabitants of our country that 

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:18.550
 they get up early to work I have to 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:21.330
 confess something 

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:23.860
 I do not like the imitators we say 

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:27.100
 inventing 

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:29.610
 is breaking a very clock to know 

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:29.610
 what 

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:34.910
 of coffee 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:44.920
 just wait for the first thing that you are 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:47.730
 receiving it with resistance do not you 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:47.730
 like what I'm saying 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:52.019
 but no 

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:59.150
 no need 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:06.050
 this would not be a reality with all the 

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:08.180
 lyrics if sooner or later there is no appeal 

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:10.190
 the cry of catalog and emotion 

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:12.920
 bought in the corner of the snow the 

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:14.599
 Youngest of all 18 year old boys 

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:18.370
 just finished the secondary as 

00:04:14.599 --> 00:04:23.810
 beautiful newly sold girl in josé c.paz 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:26.980
 blessed in josé c.paz so tranquility 

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:26.980
 yesterday I was selling 

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:31.569
 if so 

00:04:32.379 --> 00:04:35.590
 let's burn 

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:10.870
 as a team in josé c.paz yesterday I was 

00:05:07.039 --> 00:05:13.860
 selling something will be 

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:13.860
 and more guys 

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:22.740
 and I get excited and from the Cinderella with 

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:24.480
 two fairy godmothers for want of a we 

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:26.490
 we are going to a participant who like 

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:29.660
 that our beloved blue mazda tinelli and 

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:29.660
 the maipo does not stop 

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:45.720
 Nadia because I do not know I did not like the 

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:48.590
 number I thought of another program 

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:48.590
 to be honest 

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:55.470
 of those programs that we are 

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:57.479
 personally very tired to see by 

00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:59.189
 favor 

00:05:57.479 --> 00:06:01.430
 do not let them put you so much 

00:05:59.189 --> 00:06:03.620
 accent here 

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:07.840
 mehdi that I put the accent here 

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:07.840
 that estimate forces our thirst 

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:12.840
 but the main course came with the 

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:14.460
 return of this new imitator in 

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:18.650
 where no one is the one who ends 

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:18.650
 getting advice pretty well 

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:23.130
 music 

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:38.070
 yes no 

00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:55.680
 I do not like to let you humiliate suddenly 

00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:58.110
 this poor man with this is a mistake 

00:06:55.680 --> 00:07:00.570
 that many people commit and many 

00:06:58.110 --> 00:07:05.419
 we commit if it is confusing to force 

00:07:00.570 --> 00:07:05.419
 with having strength or I 

00:07:07.639 --> 00:07:12.360
 someone spoke that in the study is not 

00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:14.130
 one thing that is heard from the control 

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:16.940
 it's a sound is talking to others 

00:07:14.130 --> 00:07:16.940
 entities speak like this 

00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:24.780
 dear manners if the people look at it 

00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:26.400
 other things since we have to be 

00:07:24.780 --> 00:07:28.100
 working I hope it is not for me 

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:32.480
 old not 

00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:34.730
 obviously do not stay that by the exabrupto 

00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:37.070
 because that did not happen to you crushing 

00:07:34.730 --> 00:07:39.620
 throughout the program and a true 

00:07:37.070 --> 00:07:42.610
 artist is the one who brings out everything 

00:07:39.620 --> 00:07:42.610
 that burns inside
