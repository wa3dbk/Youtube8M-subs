 hello today we find ourselves 

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:10.590
 for a little sauce recipe 

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:12.370
 lemon 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.500
 I will make you like that small 

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:17.410
 recipes series of sauces minutes 

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:18.850
 which are done quickly and who 

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:19.410
 can be kept for a few days at 

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:22.030
 fridge 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:24.510
 we will need for that 

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:28.090
 ingredients that fit on the side 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:31.619
 so we'll start by putting our 

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:34.390
 let's mention that we will use in full 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:37.600
 ie with the skin you have to think 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:40.949
 to remove the glitch so there is some 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.949
 just a man 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:56.979
 that's it for the lemon so I put my 

00:00:45.249 --> 00:00:59.370
 small tomato but reserve my quarter of 

00:00:56.979 --> 00:00:59.370

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:11.700
 it happens 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:14.450

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:21.110

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:27.140
 a little pinch of salt and now 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.140
 we pass everything to the blender 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:42.649
 I will add a little bit 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.649
