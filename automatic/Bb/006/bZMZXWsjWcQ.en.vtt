00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:06.870
 very welcome to an informations 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:09.210
 video for the original 4 and the 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.580
 so-called new development phase 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:14.370
 johann has the studio manager of paris 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.020
 itself a new era of the eu four 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.390
 Development announced in the them 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:21.119
 some basic concepts of game 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.640
 want to revise and stop too 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:25.140
 really basic things and so 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.070
 also playful for elementary 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.170
 want to change 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.609
 it is not known exactly what they are 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:32.369
 will do all that they are 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:35.340
 enter the time again accurately known 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:38.070
 It will be about every week from now on 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:40.140
 Not every week but almost every one 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.120
 week is just about developing again 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.700
 diaries to jo fir give as in the 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.800
 development phase at that time probably still 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.030
 not to a dlc he announced though 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.430
 most likely , I just take 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.020
 at times as we previously lived with it the 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.489
 patch will appear, but it will 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.829
 will definitely be some times 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:58.949
 change again and eu 4 will be back 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:01.170
 learn some changes about the 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:02.399
 First in which John in the measure 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.760
 i want to have diary spoken i want 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:07.020
 just explain with you shortly 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:08.490
 and it keeps a short sketch in 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.409
 which you can explain most things 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.790
 and there is a flag with it 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:13.979
 extent can differ 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.810
 this was discussed in the city council 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:18.180
 have to go clearly 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.460
 one of the most basic things is that 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.450
 the property tax now in three values 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:25.580
 is divided 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:29.369
 and in the well-known property tax 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:32.909
 base production and base manpower 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:35.070
 so to speak the well-known property tax becomes 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:37.079
 as previously tax influenced 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:43.890
 Meteorite on the belly indicated by 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:45.930
 are yearly and additionally also like 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.030
 Good the bruins against spying 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:50.369
 styling can be that means there too 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.079
 I do not know about spy processing 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:54.350
 sounds like that to me but is not yet 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:54.350
 known exactly 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:02:00.390
 the basic production determines the number 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.130
 the produced goods are no longer in place 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.270
 kinda weird or plastic else 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:06.180
 really one more 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:08.280
 and how fast ships produced here 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:11.250
 can be whereas the reason 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:13.170
 manpower or base manpower determined 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:16.530
 just manpower results in this province 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:19.230
 and how fast how to get here 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:22.950
 We can recruit regiments 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:26.069
 can see these little plus symbols 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:28.230
 these values ​​are increased through and through 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:29.989
 the use of eight points administration 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:33.630
 diplomacy military 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:35.040
 the costs are still being planned 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:37.530
 you can still do that as a moment 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:39.239
 do not say how expensive that is exactly with 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:41.970
 Arma may be able to use points 

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:42.750
 to add to these values ​​of the province 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:44.430
 increase 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:46.440
 These costs are different 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:49.200
 factors are dependent on the example 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:52.170
 higher costs more expensive and worse that 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:54.269
 Terra, like desert, also costs money 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:56.069
 expensive good starts cheaper the first 

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:58.530
 hour are cheaper so it depends 

00:02:56.069 --> 00:03:00.660
 that just off and these three values 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:03.989
 together enter the new one 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:05.640
 value of the development stage is 

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:07.680
 just the addition of these three 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:09.450
 values ​​and that determines that 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:11.430
 support limit so how much so 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:14.069
 You know that much to be trained 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:16.170
 because the troops can limit the army 

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:19.290
 and marine and the number of possible 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:22.049
 building that we take in the next 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:23.510
 big point you can see it here already 

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:26.760
 a bit unfolded by this 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:29.549
 building massively overworked 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:31.530
 already there are very few and sarah the 

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:33.239
 Number of buildings significantly reduced 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:35.100
 because they just run that Act 

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:37.049
 most just have such a function 

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:39.030
 and do not seriously do what I say 

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:41.519
 now and there are only very 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:43.530
 comparable are few buildings that 

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:44.130
 but also a higher impact 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:46.049
 to have 

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:48.450
 and they do not cost you eight more points 

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:50.310
 So contrary to the previous makes points 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:52.680
 for building one has used 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:54.930
 in your 8.1 upgrade 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:56.780
 so to speak exchange a bit 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:58.920
 they have their own buildings 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:01.019
 meanings hanging there as well take 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:03.540
 So far from the government you have to 

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:04.769
 decide which buildings you build 

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:07.859
 can only have a certain number 

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:10.859
 Building the current build the base 

00:04:07.859 --> 00:04:14.010
 is a bad terra can do the whole thing 

00:04:10.859 --> 00:04:17.060
 even by 1 will reduce good farmland 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:18.810
 can increase to 1 and every tenth 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:24.750
 development stage therefore hereby to 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:28.440
 example 13/4 1.3 it can again at 1 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:33.690
 As a base 12 prairie is good and once 

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:35.730
 +1 at 3.3 because we are still the forests 

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:36.900
 the developmental stage have as at 

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:40.920
 go to school for example in 

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:44.070
 paris 14 44 building six buildings 

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:45.510
 whereas in figure I can do that 

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:50.880
 a province of north africa not a single one 

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:52.410
 can build and that is as good as long 

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:53.490
 Where have systems to one in so 

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:55.860
 to take a bit of the basic idea 

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:58.200
 now by raising this defense 

00:04:55.860 --> 00:05:00.360
 Participate in points instead of new provinces 

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:02.430
 if he old provinces just so strong 

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:04.169
 can also increasingly increase with 

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:06.570
 small rich which are well developed 

00:05:04.169 --> 00:05:08.220
 just as competitive as an example 

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:09.690
 For a short time, for example 

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:12.090
 Marketplace Canada diplomacy technology 

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:16.740
 four builds gives lustful trade power 

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:19.110
 costs 50 gold 50 gold or central from 

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:21.150
 technology as administrative technology 19 + 

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:23.550
 3 mm thickness and plus 40 percent control 

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:26.640
 brings 200 gold has only once as 

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:28.470
 example, the give and in are also heart 

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:31.800
 and a total of five examples in 

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:35.100
 linked friedrichsfeld and that was 

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:37.979
 it's also the things that are here 

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:39.900
 in the set have been announced one 

00:05:37.979 --> 00:05:41.700
 things that may be a few things 

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:44.040
 they may still be up because they too 

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:48.300
 is not discussed is one 

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:53.100
 garnison of 10,000 somehow acts as 

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:55.440
 would be the siege systematics 

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:57.540
 change at least one way 

00:05:55.440 --> 00:06:01.260
 it is not quite known yet what this 

00:05:57.540 --> 00:06:03.210
 small checkbox is just for 

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:05.280
 Show this building it could be 

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:06.419
 I could somehow imagine 

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:09.930
 take the indicator so to speak 

00:06:06.419 --> 00:06:11.820
 can hide again and very much 

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:15.240
 interesting in my eyes is up 

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:17.790
 this thing that in my eyes on itself 

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:20.340
 So if the magnifying glass is a blind one 

00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:22.050
 how to know from kusel kings 2 what 

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:23.700
 somehow it sounds like you 're blooming it 

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:25.280
 to fundamentally rework after one 

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:27.900
 yes, before has practically removed what 

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:29.310
 it really comes from what else happens 

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:32.910
 we will only one on it 

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:34.530
 see the following developer diary so 

00:06:32.910 --> 00:06:36.270
 much to the first league diary too 

00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:37.330
 By the way, this symbol is not known 

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:38.620
 what he should be 

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:40.270
 but as I said it will continue with the 

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:42.430
 diaries give further information 

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:44.800
 if you read exactly they wanted 

00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:47.319
 the link in a description and 

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:49.500
 otherwise much fun not a bit 

00:06:47.319 --> 00:06:49.500
 times
