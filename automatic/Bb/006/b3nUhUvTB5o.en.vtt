thing<00:00:16.230> I<00:00:16.289> forgot<00:00:16.320> to<00:00:16.560> mention<00:00:16.680> I<00:00:17.300> was<00:00:18.300> out<00:00:18.539> at

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
thing I forgot to mention I was out at

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.130 
thing I forgot to mention I was out at
the<00:00:19.260> Blue<00:00:19.529> Mountain<00:00:19.560> recently<00:00:20.430> and<00:00:21.050> it's<00:00:22.050> on

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
the Blue Mountain recently and it's on

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.210 
the Blue Mountain recently and it's on
the<00:00:22.230> binding<00:00:22.680> this<00:00:22.859> had<00:00:23.010> to<00:00:23.220> a<00:00:23.250> tree<00:00:23.760> run<00:00:24.000> with

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:25.220 
the binding this had to a tree run with

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:29.179 
the binding this had to a tree run with
not<00:00:26.220> a<00:00:26.250> trail<00:00:27.109> wasn't<00:00:28.109> the<00:00:28.199> greatest<00:00:28.560> idea<00:00:28.949> i

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
not a trail wasn't the greatest idea i

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:32.209 
not a trail wasn't the greatest idea i
had<00:00:29.460> my<00:00:29.670> binding<00:00:30.150> and<00:00:30.470> at<00:00:31.470> one<00:00:31.650> point<00:00:31.679> I

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
had my binding and at one point I

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:36.799 
had my binding and at one point I
smacked<00:00:33.030> a<00:00:33.180> branch<00:00:34.130> and<00:00:35.130> it<00:00:35.340> fell<00:00:35.670> off<00:00:35.880> and<00:00:36.300> I

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
smacked a branch and it fell off and I

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.280 
smacked a branch and it fell off and I
almost<00:00:36.989> lost<00:00:37.410> my<00:00:37.680> contour<00:00:38.219> on<00:00:38.340> camera<00:00:38.820> so

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:39.290 
almost lost my contour on camera so

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:42.680 
almost lost my contour on camera so
there's<00:00:40.290> one<00:00:40.800> thing<00:00:41.280> I<00:00:41.430> should've<00:00:41.700> done<00:00:41.730> which

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
there's one thing I should've done which

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.209 
there's one thing I should've done which
I<00:00:42.870> never<00:00:43.140> did<00:00:43.379> and<00:00:43.620> i'm<00:00:43.860> going<00:00:43.980> to<00:00:44.070> show<00:00:44.190> you

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
I never did and i'm going to show you

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:49.729 
I never did and i'm going to show you
what<00:00:44.460> that<00:00:44.489> is<00:00:47.660> so<00:00:48.660> this<00:00:48.809> is<00:00:48.989> the<00:00:49.170> clip<00:00:49.559> in

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
what that is so this is the clip in

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.000 
what that is so this is the clip in
question<00:00:50.870> starts<00:00:51.870> off<00:00:52.050> nice<00:00:52.230> and<00:00:52.289> easy<00:00:52.590> as

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
question starts off nice and easy as

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.790 
question starts off nice and easy as
just<00:00:53.270> lightly<00:00:54.270> wooded<00:00:54.629> area<00:00:55.170> and<00:00:55.350> that's<00:00:55.530> so

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
just lightly wooded area and that's so

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.319 
just lightly wooded area and that's so
bad<00:00:57.890> sped<00:00:58.890> up<00:00:59.070> just<00:00:59.370> so<00:00:59.550> it<00:00:59.789> doesn't<00:00:59.820> go

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
bad sped up just so it doesn't go

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:07.570 
bad sped up just so it doesn't go
forever

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:07.580 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:09.820 

now<00:01:08.180> here<00:01:08.510> he<00:01:08.540> cross<00:01:08.900> over<00:01:09.320> to<00:01:09.350> the<00:01:09.620> more

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:09.830 
now here he cross over to the more

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:11.800 
now here he cross over to the more
heavily<00:01:10.250> wooded<00:01:10.520> areas<00:01:11.000> no<00:01:11.450> one's<00:01:11.630> been

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:11.810 
heavily wooded areas no one's been

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:15.700 
heavily wooded areas no one's been
through<00:01:12.020> here<00:01:12.260> at<00:01:12.350> all<00:01:12.760> I<00:01:14.620> wasn't<00:01:15.620> feeling

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:15.710 
through here at all I wasn't feeling

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:19.750 
through here at all I wasn't feeling
greatest<00:01:16.280> about<00:01:16.610> it<00:01:18.100> really<00:01:19.100> didn't<00:01:19.460> go<00:01:19.580> well

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:19.760 
greatest about it really didn't go well

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:22.660 
greatest about it really didn't go well
I'm<00:01:20.090> speeding<00:01:20.630> up<00:01:20.780> really<00:01:21.140> quick<00:01:21.470> here<00:01:21.740> and<00:01:22.010> to

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:22.670 
I'm speeding up really quick here and to

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:25.660 
I'm speeding up really quick here and to
the<00:01:22.790> point<00:01:23.150> in<00:01:23.420> a<00:01:23.480> second<00:01:24.020> where<00:01:24.260> I<00:01:24.670> will

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:25.670 
the point in a second where I will

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:39.370 
the point in a second where I will
actually<00:01:25.880> lose<00:01:26.180> it<00:01:30.310> right<00:01:31.310> there<00:01:31.550> oh<00:01:38.380> thank

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:39.380 
actually lose it right there oh thank

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:46.780 
actually lose it right there oh thank
god<00:01:43.120> how<00:01:44.120> wouldn't<00:01:44.330> be<00:01:44.420> good<00:01:45.280> so<00:01:46.280> the<00:01:46.400> camera

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:46.790 
god how wouldn't be good so the camera

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:48.490 
god how wouldn't be good so the camera
originally<00:01:47.450> came<00:01:47.630> with<00:01:47.690> one<00:01:47.990> of<00:01:48.080> these<00:01:48.170> loops

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:48.500 
originally came with one of these loops

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:50.620 
originally came with one of these loops
that<00:01:49.490> you<00:01:49.640> can<00:01:49.790> loop<00:01:49.970> around<00:01:50.150> the<00:01:50.360> various

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:50.630 
that you can loop around the various

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:53.080 
that you can loop around the various
mountains<00:01:51.080> and<00:01:51.260> then<00:01:51.500> put<00:01:52.280> one<00:01:52.430> on<00:01:52.550> the<00:01:52.640> camera

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:53.090 
mountains and then put one on the camera

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:56.020 
mountains and then put one on the camera
and<00:01:53.560> it<00:01:54.560> will<00:01:54.710> hook<00:01:54.920> together<00:01:55.130> nicely<00:01:55.580> to<00:01:55.880> give

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:56.030 
and it will hook together nicely to give

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:58.180 
and it will hook together nicely to give
the<00:01:56.210> second<00:01:56.960> level<00:01:57.080> of<00:01:57.320> protection<00:01:57.530> in<00:01:58.160> case

00:01:58.180 --> 00:01:58.190 
the second level of protection in case

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:01.510 
the second level of protection in case
the<00:01:58.580> camera<00:01:58.940> falls<00:01:59.150> up<00:01:59.330> the<00:01:59.450> mound<00:02:00.490> now<00:02:01.490> I

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:01.520 
the camera falls up the mound now I

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:03.280 
the camera falls up the mound now I
admitted<00:02:02.150> to<00:02:02.180> do<00:02:02.420> this<00:02:02.570> when<00:02:02.780> mounting<00:02:03.170> it<00:02:03.260> to

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:03.290 
admitted to do this when mounting it to

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:09.529 
admitted to do this when mounting it to
the<00:02:03.440> Flex<00:02:03.740> trap<00:02:03.979> mount<00:02:04.280> on<00:02:04.550> my<00:02:05.210> binding

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:13.490 

so<00:02:10.539> just<00:02:10.750> to<00:02:10.869> install<00:02:11.260> this<00:02:11.500> you<00:02:12.190> uh

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
so just to install this you uh

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:22.170 
so just to install this you uh
get<00:02:14.220> the<00:02:14.340> end<00:02:14.520> together<00:02:15.060> tightly

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:29.729 

and<00:02:22.530> loop<00:02:23.530> it<00:02:23.680> around<00:02:25.469> itself<00:02:26.760> secure<00:02:27.760> it<00:02:28.739> now

00:02:29.729 --> 00:02:29.739 
and loop it around itself secure it now

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:32.099 
and loop it around itself secure it now
when<00:02:29.950> you<00:02:29.980> mount<00:02:30.189> the<00:02:30.370> camera<00:02:30.840> the<00:02:31.840> Fleck

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:32.109 
when you mount the camera the Fleck

00:02:32.109 --> 00:02:40.679 
when you mount the camera the Fleck
strap<00:02:32.379> mount<00:02:36.030> it<00:02:37.030> locks<00:02:37.359> in<00:02:37.599> place<00:02:39.030> and<00:02:40.030> you

00:02:40.679 --> 00:02:40.689 
strap mount it locks in place and you

00:02:40.689 --> 00:02:46.770 
strap mount it locks in place and you
lock<00:02:40.930> the<00:02:41.079> clip<00:02:41.319> together<00:02:45.209> now<00:02:46.209> even<00:02:46.629> if<00:02:46.719> it

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:46.780 
lock the clip together now even if it

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:49.110 
lock the clip together now even if it
gets<00:02:46.930> knocked<00:02:47.170> off<00:02:47.379> the<00:02:47.530> mound<00:02:47.790> like<00:02:48.790> it<00:02:48.969> did

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:49.120 
gets knocked off the mound like it did

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:52.830 
gets knocked off the mound like it did
for<00:02:49.150> me<00:02:49.379> it<00:02:50.379> should<00:02:50.920> theoretically<00:02:51.840> just

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:52.840 
for me it should theoretically just

00:02:52.840 --> 00:03:00.319 
for me it should theoretically just
dangle<00:02:53.319> along<00:02:53.590> with<00:02:53.829> it<00:02:56.639> and<00:02:57.639> it's<00:02:58.510> fairly

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:00.329 
dangle along with it and it's fairly

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:03.750 
dangle along with it and it's fairly
fairly<00:03:01.329> strong<00:03:01.840> I'm<00:03:02.310> trying<00:03:03.310> to<00:03:03.430> pull<00:03:03.639> it

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:03.760 
fairly strong I'm trying to pull it

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:05.610 
fairly strong I'm trying to pull it
apart<00:03:03.819> but<00:03:04.239> it's<00:03:04.419> not<00:03:04.450> happening<00:03:05.200> so<00:03:05.439> this

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:05.620 
apart but it's not happening so this

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:08.819 
apart but it's not happening so this
would<00:03:05.889> uh<00:03:06.810> this<00:03:07.810> would<00:03:08.049> have<00:03:08.169> helped<00:03:08.469> me<00:03:08.620> and

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:08.829 
would uh this would have helped me and

00:03:08.829 --> 00:03:10.830

not losing the cameras I'm not to dig

through<00:03:11.079> in<00:03:11.200> the<00:03:11.349> snow<00:03:11.620> which<00:03:11.980> I<00:03:12.189> was<00:03:12.519> lucky<00:03:12.909> I

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:12.969 
through in the snow which I was lucky I

00:03:12.969 --> 00:03:16.920 
through in the snow which I was lucky I
found<00:03:13.590> so<00:03:14.590> this<00:03:14.859> is<00:03:15.159> a<00:03:15.239> recommended<00:03:16.239> step<00:03:16.719> do

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:16.930 
found so this is a recommended step do

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:20.159 
found so this is a recommended step do
this<00:03:17.079> loop<00:03:17.379> otherwise<00:03:17.919> you<00:03:18.310> might<00:03:18.930> does<00:03:19.930> fall

00:03:20.159 --> 00:03:20.169 
this loop otherwise you might does fall

00:03:20.169 --> 00:03:21.629 
this loop otherwise you might does fall
off<00:03:20.290> you<00:03:20.530> might<00:03:20.680> lose<00:03:20.919> your<00:03:20.980> camera<00:03:21.400> which<00:03:21.519> is

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:21.639 
off you might lose your camera which is

00:03:21.639 --> 00:03:24.090 
off you might lose your camera which is
