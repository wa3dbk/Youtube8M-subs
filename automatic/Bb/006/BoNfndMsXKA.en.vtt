00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
when I was making it I had to make sure

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.869 
when I was making it I had to make sure
everything<00:00:58.469> fit<00:00:58.710> up<00:00:58.859> for<00:00:59.039> the<00:00:59.100> most<00:00:59.280> part<00:00:59.609> and

the front here where the poles start is
because<00:01:36.659> when<00:01:36.840> this<00:01:36.960> is<00:01:37.110> all<00:01:37.259> done<00:01:37.500> I'm<00:01:37.799> gonna

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
because when this is all done I'm gonna

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.340 
because when this is all done I'm gonna
enclose<00:01:38.400> it<00:01:38.640> in<00:01:38.729> plywood<00:01:39.329> it's<00:01:40.049> like<00:01:40.229> an

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
enclose it in plywood it's like an

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.280 
enclose it in plywood it's like an
angled<00:01:40.740> roof<00:01:40.920> on<00:01:41.220> it<00:01:41.570> so<00:01:42.570> if<00:01:42.840> it's<00:01:42.990> out<00:01:43.140> in<00:01:43.229> the

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
angled roof on it so if it's out in the

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.889 
angled roof on it so if it's out in the
snow<00:01:43.590> or<00:01:43.740> the<00:01:43.829> rain<00:01:43.860> it<00:01:44.250> won't<00:01:45.240> get<00:01:45.509> all<00:01:45.659> wet

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
snow or the rain it won't get all wet

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:52.359 
snow or the rain it won't get all wet
and<00:01:46.200> rained<00:01:46.619> on<00:01:49.460> but<00:01:50.460> I<00:01:50.520> was<00:01:50.729> gonna<00:01:50.880> put<00:01:51.210> a

Kohler Magnum on it which is back there

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.609 
Kohler Magnum on it which is back there
Jay<00:01:57.390> got<00:01:57.570> it<00:01:57.659> running<00:01:57.810> doesn't<00:01:58.500> have

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
Jay got it running doesn't have

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.609 
Jay got it running doesn't have
everything<00:01:58.890> on<00:01:59.189> it<00:01:59.369> like<00:01:59.549> a<00:01:59.759> lot<00:02:00.360> of<00:02:00.509> the

00:02:00.609 --> 00:02:00.619 
everything on it like a lot of the

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:03.580 
everything on it like a lot of the
throttle<00:02:01.619> stuff's<00:02:01.890> missing<00:02:02.369> in<00:02:02.520> the<00:02:02.579> gas<00:02:02.790> tank

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:03.590 
throttle stuff's missing in the gas tank

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:07.880 
throttle stuff's missing in the gas tank
but<00:02:04.590> I<00:02:04.829> had<00:02:05.729> a<00:02:05.759> Honda<00:02:06.270> and<00:02:06.479> I<00:02:06.509> just<00:02:06.770> assumed<00:02:07.770> to

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
but I had a Honda and I just assumed to

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.290 
but I had a Honda and I just assumed to
put<00:02:08.069> this<00:02:08.220> on<00:02:08.459> cuz<00:02:08.700> they're<00:02:08.819> more<00:02:09.000> reliable

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
put this on cuz they're more reliable

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.360 
put this on cuz they're more reliable
you<00:02:10.140> know<00:02:10.259> it<00:02:10.379> usually<00:02:10.560> starts<00:02:10.950> the<00:02:11.099> first

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
you know it usually starts the first

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.500 
you know it usually starts the first
pull<00:02:11.700> so

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
pull so

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:16.170 
pull so
and<00:02:14.510> the<00:02:14.750> giri<00:02:14.989> duck<00:02:15.290> well<00:02:15.530> the<00:02:15.799> belt

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
and the giri duck well the belt

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:18.610 
and the giri duck well the belt
reduction<00:02:17.180> with<00:02:17.330> the<00:02:17.360> put<00:02:17.599> to<00:02:17.750> paly<00:02:18.049> is<00:02:18.290> about

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
reduction with the put to paly is about

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:21.670 
reduction with the put to paly is about
a<00:02:18.650> two<00:02:19.069> to<00:02:19.099> one<00:02:19.430> for<00:02:19.870> the<00:02:20.870> engine<00:02:21.530> and

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680 
a two to one for the engine and

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:23.860 
a two to one for the engine and
alternator<00:02:22.430> so<00:02:22.700> it<00:02:22.790> spins<00:02:23.060> pretty<00:02:23.299> quick<00:02:23.659> at

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:23.870 
alternator so it spins pretty quick at

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:25.990 
alternator so it spins pretty quick at
an<00:02:23.989> idle<00:02:24.319> so<00:02:25.250> you<00:02:25.340> really<00:02:25.549> shouldn't<00:02:25.760> have<00:02:25.819> to

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:26.000 
an idle so you really shouldn't have to

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:59.720 
an idle so you really shouldn't have to
run<00:02:26.120> it<00:02:26.239> that<00:02:26.360> fast<00:02:48.160> 40<00:02:49.160> degrees<00:02:49.519> out<00:02:49.810> actually

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:02.190 

now<00:03:00.730> that<00:03:00.910> was<00:03:01.030> tension<00:03:01.240> on<00:03:01.660> the<00:03:01.750> belt<00:03:01.870> yet

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:02.200 
now that was tension on the belt yet

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:31.220 
now that was tension on the belt yet
that'll<00:03:02.980> stop<00:03:03.220> when<00:03:03.460> I<00:03:03.550> get<00:03:03.790> a<00:03:04.200> working<00:03:05.200> off

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.230 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:35.850 

mm-hmm<00:03:32.230> so<00:03:32.740> I<00:03:32.950> plan<00:03:33.250> to<00:03:33.280> use<00:03:33.430> this<00:03:34.590> up<00:03:35.590> in<00:03:35.770> the

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:35.860 
mm-hmm so I plan to use this up in the

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:38.220 
mm-hmm so I plan to use this up in the
woods<00:03:36.069> really<00:03:36.340> for<00:03:37.090> around<00:03:37.300> my<00:03:37.510> garage<00:03:37.780> I<00:03:38.110> have

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:38.230 
woods really for around my garage I have

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:39.930 
woods really for around my garage I have
some<00:03:38.410> lights<00:03:38.620> I<00:03:38.800> made<00:03:39.010> for<00:03:39.370> it<00:03:39.459> that<00:03:39.610> run<00:03:39.760> off

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:39.940 
some lights I made for it that run off

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:44.010 
some lights I made for it that run off
12<00:03:40.270> volts<00:03:41.130> but<00:03:42.130> uh<00:03:42.360> I'm<00:03:43.360> gonna<00:03:43.540> mount<00:03:43.720> them<00:03:43.930> up

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:44.020 
12 volts but uh I'm gonna mount them up

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:46.770 
12 volts but uh I'm gonna mount them up
on<00:03:44.200> some<00:03:44.410> tree<00:03:44.650> so<00:03:44.950> when<00:03:45.190> I'm<00:03:45.310> up<00:03:45.430> there<00:03:45.780> during

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:46.780 
on some tree so when I'm up there during

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:48.600 
on some tree so when I'm up there during
the<00:03:47.020> night<00:03:47.200> if<00:03:47.440> I'm<00:03:47.590> doing<00:03:47.890> something<00:03:48.160> I<00:03:48.400> can

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:48.610 
the night if I'm doing something I can

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:51.660 
the night if I'm doing something I can
fire<00:03:49.150> this<00:03:49.360> up<00:03:49.540> and<00:03:49.750> turn<00:03:49.900> them<00:03:50.050> on<00:03:50.580> I'm<00:03:51.580> just

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:51.670 
fire this up and turn them on I'm just

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:54.750 
fire this up and turn them on I'm just
gonna<00:03:51.850> have<00:03:52.090> this<00:03:52.300> push<00:03:52.569> out<00:03:52.780> a<00:03:53.220> 12<00:03:54.220> volts<00:03:54.610> for

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:54.760 
gonna have this push out a 12 volts for

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:57.809 
gonna have this push out a 12 volts for
the<00:03:54.850> most<00:03:55.060> part<00:03:55.440> and<00:03:56.440> I<00:03:57.100> can<00:03:57.250> always<00:03:57.400> get<00:03:57.700> in

00:03:57.809 --> 00:03:57.819 
the most part and I can always get in

00:03:57.819 --> 00:04:00.180 
the most part and I can always get in
the<00:03:58.000> inverter<00:03:58.780> for<00:03:59.170> later<00:03:59.500> on<00:03:59.739> and<00:03:59.920> that<00:03:59.950> does

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:00.190 
the inverter for later on and that does

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:03.960 
the inverter for later on and that does
maybe<00:04:00.840> mmm<00:04:01.930> 2,000<00:04:02.920> watts<00:04:03.070> I<00:04:03.310> guess<00:04:03.519> he<00:04:03.700> can<00:04:03.820> run

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:03.970 
maybe mmm 2,000 watts I guess he can run

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:07.530 
maybe mmm 2,000 watts I guess he can run
a<00:04:04.000> drill<00:04:04.330> or<00:04:04.360> something<00:04:06.239> well<00:04:07.239> there<00:04:07.390> you<00:04:07.510> have

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:07.540 
a drill or something well there you have

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:08.430 
a drill or something well there you have
it<00:04:07.750> for<00:04:08.050> now

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:08.440 
it for now

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:10.140 
it for now
you<00:04:08.860> know<00:04:09.010> probably<00:04:09.519> be<00:04:09.610> putting<00:04:09.790> video

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:10.150 
you know probably be putting video

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:13.470 
you know probably be putting video
updates<00:04:10.570> on<00:04:10.780> this<00:04:10.959> as<00:04:11.200> I<00:04:11.350> go<00:04:11.500> along<00:04:11.650> so<00:04:12.480> the

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:13.480 
updates on this as I go along so the

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:14.759 
updates on this as I go along so the
only<00:04:13.600> thing<00:04:13.900> that's<00:04:14.110> really<00:04:14.290> holding<00:04:14.620> this

00:04:14.759 --> 00:04:14.769 
only thing that's really holding this

00:04:14.769 --> 00:04:16.590 
only thing that's really holding this
project<00:04:15.280> up<00:04:15.459> is<00:04:15.670> the<00:04:15.790> alternator<00:04:16.180> because

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:16.600 
project up is the alternator because

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:19.259 
project up is the alternator because
once<00:04:16.780> they<00:04:16.900> get<00:04:17.019> ahold<00:04:17.169> of<00:04:17.470> one<00:04:18.000> this<00:04:19.000> will<00:04:19.180> go

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:19.269 
once they get ahold of one this will go

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:20.819 
once they get ahold of one this will go
together<00:04:19.450> real<00:04:19.810> quick<00:04:19.840> I<00:04:20.230> just<00:04:20.410> don't<00:04:20.590> want<00:04:20.739> to

00:04:20.819 --> 00:04:20.829 
together real quick I just don't want to

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:22.950 
together real quick I just don't want to
buy<00:04:20.980> one<00:04:21.250> because<00:04:21.700> they're<00:04:21.910> quite<00:04:22.540> expensive

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:22.960 
buy one because they're quite expensive

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:24.690 
buy one because they're quite expensive
and<00:04:23.410> I<00:04:23.560> don't<00:04:23.890> feel<00:04:24.010> like<00:04:24.130> spending<00:04:24.370> a<00:04:24.520> ton<00:04:24.640> of

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:24.700 
and I don't feel like spending a ton of

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:28.260 
and I don't feel like spending a ton of
money<00:04:24.880> on<00:04:25.000> this<00:04:25.300> so<00:04:25.600> it's<00:04:26.410> pretty<00:04:26.560> much<00:04:26.800> a<00:04:27.270> low

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:28.270 
money on this so it's pretty much a low

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:31.889 
money on this so it's pretty much a low
cost<00:04:28.510> project<00:04:29.169> for<00:04:29.320> the<00:04:29.410> most<00:04:29.590> part
