careful with the throttle because I was

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:06.240 
like about this castle SCT system was

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:08.480 
like about this castle SCT system was
that<00:05:06.570> the<00:05:06.750> speed<00:05:07.080> control<00:05:07.500> ran<00:05:07.770> a<00:05:07.800> little<00:05:08.310> bit

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:08.490 
that the speed control ran a little bit

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:09.380 
that the speed control ran a little bit
too<00:05:08.820> warm

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:09.390 
too warm

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:12.170

I<00:05:09.540> saw<00:05:09.870> the<00:05:09.960> heatsinks<00:05:10.590> get<00:05:10.770> over<00:05:11.160> 150<00:05:11.850> degrees

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:12.180 
I saw the heatsinks get over 150 degrees

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:14.630 
I saw the heatsinks get over 150 degrees
which<00:05:12.480> is<00:05:12.690> not<00:05:12.960> dangerous<00:05:13.320> but<00:05:13.920> it<00:05:14.010> is<00:05:14.160> much

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:14.640 
which is not dangerous but it is much

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:16.910 
which is not dangerous but it is much
hotter<00:05:15.000> than<00:05:15.120> any<00:05:15.450> other<00:05:15.690> ESC<00:05:16.410> that<00:05:16.560> I've<00:05:16.680> run

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:16.920

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:21.840 
figured out an easy and cheap solution

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:22.850 
figured out an easy and cheap solution
to<00:05:22.260> that<00:05:22.290> problem

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:22.860 
to that problem

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:25.400 
to that problem
in<00:05:23.130> fact<00:05:23.340> it's<00:05:23.670> completely<00:05:23.820> free<00:05:24.300> see<00:05:25.020> the

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:25.410 
in fact it's completely free see the

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:27.950 
in fact it's completely free see the
motor<00:05:25.650> runs<00:05:26.010> perfectly<00:05:26.580> cool<00:05:26.910> but<00:05:27.300> the<00:05:27.390> ESC

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:27.960 
motor runs perfectly cool but the ESC

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:31.220 
motor runs perfectly cool but the ESC
runs<00:05:28.320> hot<00:05:28.650> so<00:05:29.070> you<00:05:29.160> just<00:05:29.550> take<00:05:29.760> the<00:05:30.000> motor<00:05:30.720> fan

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:31.230 
runs hot so you just take the motor fan

runs hot so you just take the motor fan

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:35.840 
that's included in the package and you
attach<00:05:33.660> it<00:05:33.870> to<00:05:34.020> the<00:05:34.110> ESC<00:05:34.650> it<00:05:35.190> fits<00:05:35.430> right<00:05:35.790> over

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:49.850 
that keeps it nice and secure and there
you<00:05:47.970> go<00:05:48.180> this<00:05:48.750> can<00:05:48.960> drop<00:05:49.200> your<00:05:49.350> ESC
