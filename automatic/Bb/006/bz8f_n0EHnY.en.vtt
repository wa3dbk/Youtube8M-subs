streak<00:03:42.100> because<00:03:42.670> of<00:03:42.910> mousse<00:03:43.120> so<00:03:43.960> it<00:03:44.020> goes<00:03:44.230> on

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:44.530 
streak because of mousse so it goes on

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:47.160

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:34.170 
clothes on again we'll sit down so I'll

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:35.570 
clothes on again we'll sit down so I'll
walk<00:04:34.290> around<00:04:34.470> your<00:04:34.740> room<00:04:34.860> maybe<00:04:35.070> do<00:04:35.160> some<00:04:35.310> star

jumps or something then sleep in it or

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:39.830 
jumps or something then sleep in it or
you<00:04:38.400> can<00:04:38.580> leave<00:04:38.610> it<00:04:38.790> to<00:04:39.000> four<00:04:39.210> to<00:04:39.360> eight<00:04:39.480> hours

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:39.840 
you can leave it to four to eight hours

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:41.780 
you can leave it to four to eight hours
I<00:04:39.960> think<00:04:40.200> I<00:04:40.320> sleep<00:04:40.680> in<00:04:40.890> it<00:04:41.040> and<00:04:41.250> then<00:04:41.580> in<00:04:41.760> the

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:41.790 
I think I sleep in it and then in the

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:44.240 
I think I sleep in it and then in the
morning<00:04:42.030> or<00:04:42.660> whenever<00:04:42.960> print<00:04:43.680> it<00:04:43.830> off<00:04:43.950> without

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:44.250 
morning or whenever print it off without

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:46.430 
morning or whenever print it off without
so<00:04:44.670> you<00:04:45.000> just<00:04:45.330> rinse<00:04:45.480> it<00:04:45.660> off<00:04:45.810> and<00:04:46.080> then<00:04:46.230> later

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:46.440 
so you just rinse it off and then later

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:48.350 
so you just rinse it off and then later
on<00:04:46.680> then<00:04:47.040> you<00:04:47.190> can<00:04:47.370> I<00:04:47.460> guess<00:04:47.670> wash<00:04:47.940> yourself

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:48.360 
on then you can I guess wash yourself

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:49.640 
on then you can I guess wash yourself
you<00:04:48.540> just<00:04:48.720> don't<00:04:48.870> want<00:04:48.990> it<00:04:49.050> to<00:04:49.140> fall<00:04:49.260> short<00:04:49.320> of
