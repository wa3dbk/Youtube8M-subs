of this to do with MS 1 but the basics
may<00:00:46.179> be<00:00:47.179> a<00:00:47.210> little<00:00:47.389> bit<00:00:47.600> the<00:00:47.749> same<00:00:47.989> but<00:00:48.289> this<00:00:48.440> is

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:48.589 
may be a little bit the same but this is

00:00:48.589 --> 00:00:52.329 
may be a little bit the same but this is
mainly<00:00:49.069> aimed<00:00:49.339> at<00:00:49.550> M<00:00:49.609> s2<00:00:49.909> and<00:00:50.059> s3<00:00:51.159> but<00:00:52.159> we're

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:52.339 
mainly aimed at M s2 and s3 but we're

00:00:52.339 --> 00:00:53.680 
mainly aimed at M s2 and s3 but we're
going<00:00:52.460> to<00:00:52.550> do<00:00:52.609> it<00:00:52.699> start<00:00:52.969> with<00:00:53.179> we're<00:00:53.449> going<00:00:53.600> to

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:53.690 
going to do it start with we're going to

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:57.369 
going to do it start with we're going to
and<00:00:54.289> just<00:00:54.559> have<00:00:54.649> a<00:00:54.710> quick<00:00:54.979> look<00:00:55.219> I'm<00:00:55.760> just<00:00:56.449> just

00:00:57.369 --> 00:00:57.379 
and just have a quick look I'm just just

00:00:57.379 --> 00:00:58.989 
and just have a quick look I'm just just
going<00:00:57.530> to<00:00:57.620> this<00:00:57.949> is<00:00:58.069> what<00:00:58.249> you'd<00:00:58.399> end<00:00:58.639> up<00:00:58.760> with

00:00:58.989 --> 00:00:58.999 
going to this is what you'd end up with

00:00:58.999 --> 00:01:00.759 
going to this is what you'd end up with
your<00:00:59.569> screen<00:00:59.870> be<00:01:00.109> slightly<00:01:00.350> different<00:01:00.620> to

00:01:00.759 --> 00:01:00.769 
your screen be slightly different to

00:01:00.769 --> 00:01:03.039 
your screen be slightly different to
this<00:01:00.949> because<00:01:01.190> I've<00:01:01.609> registered<00:01:01.940> in<00:01:02.659> studio

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:03.049 
this because I've registered in studio

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:04.810 
this because I've registered in studio
and<00:01:03.199> added<00:01:03.469> a<00:01:03.589> lot<00:01:03.739> of<00:01:03.769> features<00:01:03.949> so<00:01:04.460> as<00:01:04.549> we<00:01:04.699> can

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:04.820 
and added a lot of features so as we can

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:08.380 
and added a lot of features so as we can
do<00:01:04.970> all<00:01:05.120> this<00:01:05.269> stuff<00:01:06.369> or<00:01:07.369> add<00:01:07.520> a<00:01:07.549> lot<00:01:07.820> of<00:01:07.939> dials

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:08.390 
do all this stuff or add a lot of dials

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:11.950 
do all this stuff or add a lot of dials
rather<00:01:08.920> but<00:01:09.920> you<00:01:10.670> fuel<00:01:11.329> load<00:01:11.570> and<00:01:11.869> your

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:11.960 
rather but you fuel load and your

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:16.179 
rather but you fuel load and your
throttle<00:01:12.229> position<00:01:14.409> may<00:01:15.409> look<00:01:15.590> a<00:01:15.680> bit<00:01:15.710> funky

00:01:16.179 --> 00:01:16.189 
throttle position may look a bit funky

00:01:16.189 --> 00:01:17.649 
throttle position may look a bit funky
when<00:01:16.340> you<00:01:16.430> switch<00:01:16.610> the<00:01:16.759> power<00:01:16.939> on<00:01:17.210> when<00:01:17.600> you

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:17.659 
when you switch the power on when you

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:19.359 
when you switch the power on when you
first<00:01:17.810> get<00:01:17.990> the<00:01:18.109> per<00:01:18.229> ignition<00:01:18.740> switched<00:01:19.159> on

00:01:19.359 --> 00:01:19.369 
first get the per ignition switched on

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:21.880 
first get the per ignition switched on
and<00:01:19.549> the<00:01:19.670> ECU<00:01:20.090> connected<00:01:20.619> basically<00:01:21.619> if<00:01:21.770> you

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:21.890 
and the ECU connected basically if you

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:24.389 
and the ECU connected basically if you
load<00:01:22.189> if<00:01:22.490> you're<00:01:22.820> in<00:01:22.909> manifold<00:01:23.420> airflow<00:01:23.869> and

00:01:24.389 --> 00:01:24.399 
load if you're in manifold airflow and

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:28.179 
load if you're in manifold airflow and
if<00:01:25.399> you're<00:01:25.549> in<00:01:25.700> speed<00:01:26.539> density<00:01:26.719> mode<00:01:27.200> let's

00:01:28.179 --> 00:01:28.189 
if you're in speed density mode let's

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:34.740 
if you're in speed density mode let's
just<00:01:28.399> change<00:01:28.549> the<00:01:28.759> speed<00:01:29.030> density

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:34.750 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:41.050 

to<00:01:35.750> Sahgal<00:01:36.200> power<00:01:39.190> you'll<00:01:40.190> see<00:01:40.520> the<00:01:40.670> fuel<00:01:40.880> load

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:41.060 
to Sahgal power you'll see the fuel load

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:44.290 
to Sahgal power you'll see the fuel load
goes<00:01:41.240> up<00:01:41.450> to<00:01:41.570> 100%<00:01:41.930> on<00:01:42.710> 99.9<00:01:43.520> that's<00:01:43.790> basically

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:44.300 
goes up to 100% on 99.9 that's basically

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:47.440 
goes up to 100% on 99.9 that's basically
barometric<00:01:44.720> plus<00:01:45.710> the<00:01:46.210> atmospheric<00:01:47.210> pressure

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:47.450 
barometric plus the atmospheric pressure

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:49.870 
barometric plus the atmospheric pressure
because<00:01:47.750> then<00:01:48.110> engines<00:01:48.650> not<00:01:48.800> running<00:01:48.950> soon<00:01:49.730> as

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:49.880 
because then engines not running soon as

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:51.340 
because then engines not running soon as
the<00:01:49.940> engine<00:01:50.150> starts<00:01:50.390> running<00:01:50.690> the<00:01:50.720> fuel<00:01:51.110> load

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:51.350 
the engine starts running the fuel load

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:54.490 
the engine starts running the fuel load
in<00:01:51.620> speed<00:01:52.160> density<00:01:52.370> mode<00:01:52.810> your<00:01:53.810> manifold<00:01:54.320> air

00:01:59.110 --> 00:01:59.120 
the vacuum in the engine and that come

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:04.870 
the vacuum in the engine and that come
down<00:01:59.330> to<00:01:59.390> 40<00:01:59.990> 50<00:02:00.170> 30<00:02:00.920> kPa<00:02:01.400> which<00:02:01.730> be<00:02:02.390> 34<00:02:03.460> in<00:02:04.460> your

atmospheric<00:02:18.140> pressure<00:02:18.410> if<00:02:19.250> I<00:02:19.340> start<00:02:19.610> the

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:19.760 
atmospheric pressure if I start the

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:21.430 
atmospheric pressure if I start the
engine<00:02:20.060> up<00:02:20.150> that<00:02:20.330> come<00:02:20.600> back<00:02:20.750> down<00:02:20.959> that<00:02:21.170> come

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:21.440 
engine up that come back down that come

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:23.230 
engine up that come back down that come
down<00:02:21.590> here<00:02:21.860> here<00:02:22.220> somewhere<00:02:22.730> because<00:02:22.910> so

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:23.240 
down here here somewhere because so

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:24.970 
down here here somewhere because so
that's<00:02:23.450> where<00:02:23.660> my<00:02:23.840> engine<00:02:24.170> would<00:02:24.320> run<00:02:24.560> the

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:24.980 
that's where my engine would run the

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:27.520 
that's where my engine would run the
idle<00:02:25.430> well<00:02:26.090> actually<00:02:26.810> there<00:02:27.140> because<00:02:27.230> there's

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:27.530 
idle well actually there because there's

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:30.460 
idle well actually there because there's
five<00:02:27.709> hundred<00:02:28.010> rpms<00:02:28.459> it<00:02:29.270> roughly<00:02:29.930> idle<00:02:30.350> around

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:30.470 
five hundred rpms it roughly idle around

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:34.000 
five hundred rpms it roughly idle around
there<00:02:31.660> and<00:02:32.660> then<00:02:32.959> if<00:02:33.140> I<00:02:33.260> have<00:02:33.380> one<00:02:33.530> went<00:02:33.709> over

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.010 
there and then if I have one went over

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:36.940 
there and then if I have one went over
as<00:02:34.370> his<00:02:34.910> speed<00:02:35.600> density<00:02:35.780> mode<00:02:36.200> would<00:02:36.530> use<00:02:36.800> the

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:36.950 
as his speed density mode would use the

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:40.300 
as his speed density mode would use the
manifold<00:02:37.310> air<00:02:37.430> pressure<00:02:37.700> media<00:02:38.600> sensor<00:02:39.590> if<00:02:39.830> I

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
manifold air pressure media sensor if I

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:42.930 
manifold air pressure media sensor if I
went<00:02:40.519> over<00:02:40.790> 100<00:02:41.150> kPa<00:02:41.450> then<00:02:41.660> that's<00:02:41.870> boost<00:02:42.110> so

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:42.940 
went over 100 kPa then that's boost so

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:47.650 
went over 100 kPa then that's boost so
150<00:02:43.940> kPa<00:02:44.390> is<00:02:44.720> basically<00:02:46.269> half<00:02:47.269> of<00:02:47.510> that

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:47.660 
150 kPa is basically half of that

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:49.930 
150 kPa is basically half of that
mascara<00:02:48.019> pressure<00:02:48.410> which<00:02:48.800> absolute<00:02:49.670> pressure

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:49.940 
mascara pressure which absolute pressure

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:54.340 
mascara pressure which absolute pressure
is<00:02:51.010> fourteen<00:02:52.010> point<00:02:52.250> seven<00:02:52.780> so<00:02:53.780> that<00:02:53.810> would<00:02:54.200> be

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:54.350 
is fourteen point seven so that would be

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:59.949 
is fourteen point seven so that would be
roughly<00:02:54.830> about<00:02:55.220> a<00:02:55.250> seven<00:02:55.850> psi<00:02:56.420> of<00:02:57.160> boost<00:02:58.959> but

00:02:59.949 --> 00:02:59.959 
roughly about a seven psi of boost but

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:05.650 
roughly about a seven psi of boost but
enough<00:03:00.709> of<00:03:00.830> that<00:03:00.890> we<00:03:01.340> are<00:03:01.730> going<00:03:02.150> to<00:03:02.500> also<00:03:04.660> go

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:05.660 
enough of that we are going to also go

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:07.990 
enough of that we are going to also go
back<00:03:05.810> to<00:03:05.930> alpha<00:03:06.170> N<00:03:06.290> and<00:03:06.709> you'll<00:03:07.280> see<00:03:07.640> that<00:03:07.850> the

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:08.000 
back to alpha N and you'll see that the

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.140 
back to alpha N and you'll see that the
fuel<00:03:08.330> load<00:03:08.570> is<00:03:08.750> now<00:03:08.930> gone<00:03:09.830> to<00:03:10.280> the<00:03:10.640> same<00:03:10.820> as<00:03:11.030> the

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:11.150 
fuel load is now gone to the same as the

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:12.520 
fuel load is now gone to the same as the
throttle<00:03:11.420> position<00:03:11.510> sensor<00:03:12.170> just<00:03:12.260> lease

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:12.530 
throttle position sensor just lease

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:19.449 
throttle position sensor just lease
local<00:03:13.630> power

00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:19.459 

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:21.699 

so<00:03:20.090> fuel<00:03:20.450> load<00:03:20.659> is<00:03:20.840> now<00:03:21.019> in<00:03:21.200> the<00:03:21.260> same<00:03:21.469> as<00:03:21.590> the

00:03:21.699 --> 00:03:21.709 
so fuel load is now in the same as the

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:24.160 
so fuel load is now in the same as the
throttle<00:03:21.890> position<00:03:22.040> sensor<00:03:22.730> so<00:03:23.540> basically

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:24.170 
throttle position sensor so basically

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:25.569 
throttle position sensor so basically
what<00:03:24.439> we've<00:03:24.590> got<00:03:24.769> here<00:03:25.010> if<00:03:25.129> I<00:03:25.250> alt<00:03:25.430> the

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:25.579 
what we've got here if I alt the

00:03:25.579 --> 00:03:28.059 
what we've got here if I alt the
throttle<00:03:25.909> position<00:03:26.170> the<00:03:27.170> fuel<00:03:27.409> load<00:03:27.620> all<00:03:27.890> of

00:03:28.059 --> 00:03:28.069 
throttle position the fuel load all of

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:34.750 
throttle position the fuel load all of
us<00:03:28.159> as<00:03:28.310> well<00:03:28.489> so<00:03:32.170> in<00:03:33.170> alpha<00:03:33.799> alpha<00:03:34.069> alpha<00:03:34.400> Ren

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:34.760 
us as well so in alpha alpha alpha Ren

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:39.250 
us as well so in alpha alpha alpha Ren
mode<00:03:35.409> we<00:03:36.409> that<00:03:37.370> control<00:03:37.849> algorithm<00:03:38.629> uses<00:03:39.049> the

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:39.260 
mode we that control algorithm uses the

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.080 
mode we that control algorithm uses the
flaw<00:03:39.469> position<00:03:39.950> so<00:03:40.280> if<00:03:40.430> you<00:03:40.609> had<00:03:40.849> an

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:41.090 
flaw position so if you had an

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:42.610

throttle bodies the rover alot engines

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:48.399 
throttle bodies the rover alot engines
actually<00:03:46.370> respond<00:03:46.730> better<00:03:46.969> to<00:03:47.120> alpha<00:03:47.780> n<00:03:47.959> if

00:03:48.409 --> 00:03:50.170 
actually respond better to alpha n if
the<00:03:48.650> booster<00:03:49.099> then<00:03:49.280> you<00:03:49.430> got<00:03:49.639> you<00:03:49.909> speed

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:50.180 
the booster then you got you speed

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:51.399 
the booster then you got you speed

you're in boost and when you're not but
a<00:03:57.200> lot<00:03:57.739> of<00:03:57.769> setup<00:03:58.069> seem<00:03:58.430> to<00:03:58.639> react<00:03:59.000> better<00:03:59.269> to

a lot of setup seem to react better to

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:02.920 
a lot of setup seem to react better to
our<00:03:59.689> friend<00:04:00.049> because<00:04:01.269> when<00:04:02.269> you<00:04:02.389> stab<00:04:02.810> the

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:02.930 
our friend because when you stab the

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:06.149 
our friend because when you stab the
throttle<00:04:03.349> the<00:04:03.769> ECU<00:04:04.280> instantly<00:04:04.939> sees<00:04:05.540> that<00:04:05.810> and

00:04:06.149 --> 00:04:06.159 
throttle the ECU instantly sees that and

00:04:06.159 --> 00:04:08.800 
throttle the ECU instantly sees that and
follows<00:04:07.159> that<00:04:07.400> in<00:04:07.760> the<00:04:07.879> map<00:04:08.090> in<00:04:08.329> the<00:04:08.419> fuel<00:04:08.629> map

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:08.810 
follows that in the map in the fuel map

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:10.750 
follows that in the map in the fuel map
whereas<00:04:09.739> there's<00:04:09.950> always<00:04:10.099> a<00:04:10.219> slight<00:04:10.489> delay

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:10.760 
whereas there's always a slight delay

whereas there's always a slight delay
with<00:04:11.180> manifold<00:04:11.659> air<00:04:11.810> pressure<00:04:12.139> so<00:04:14.919> okay<00:04:15.919> we're

00:04:16.089 --> 00:04:16.099 
with manifold air pressure so okay we're

00:04:16.099 --> 00:04:19.900 
with manifold air pressure so okay we're
going<00:04:16.190> to<00:04:16.250> calibrate<00:04:16.549> through<00:04:16.880> opposition<00:04:18.910> so

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:19.910 
going to calibrate through opposition so

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:22.839 
going to calibrate through opposition so
this<00:04:20.720> is<00:04:20.870> my<00:04:21.079> stimulate<00:04:21.530> but<00:04:21.739> basically<00:04:22.610> when

00:04:22.839 --> 00:04:22.849 
this is my stimulate but basically when

00:04:22.849 --> 00:04:24.969 
this is my stimulate but basically when
you<00:04:22.970> switch<00:04:23.150> the<00:04:23.270> power<00:04:23.419> on<00:04:23.659> your<00:04:24.500> throttle

00:04:24.969 --> 00:04:24.979 
you switch the power on your throttle

00:04:24.979 --> 00:04:27.700 
you switch the power on your throttle
position<00:04:25.039> sensor<00:04:25.639> won't<00:04:25.849> follow<00:04:26.500> what<00:04:27.500> may

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:27.710 
position sensor won't follow what may

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:30.159 
position sensor won't follow what may
but<00:04:28.070> you'd<00:04:28.280> be<00:04:28.400> lucky<00:04:28.520> if<00:04:28.729> it<00:04:28.820> does<00:04:29.000> so<00:04:29.690> first

00:04:30.159 --> 00:04:30.169 
but you'd be lucky if it does so first

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:31.510 
but you'd be lucky if it does so first
thing<00:04:30.380> do<00:04:30.500> is<00:04:30.560> calibrate<00:04:30.800> through<00:04:31.130> opposition

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:31.520 
thing do is calibrate through opposition

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:34.810 
thing do is calibrate through opposition
sensor<00:04:31.880> so<00:04:32.030> we're<00:04:32.240> going<00:04:32.389> to<00:04:33.669> off<00:04:34.669> the

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:34.820 
sensor so we're going to off the

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:37.719 
sensor so we're going to off the
throttle<00:04:35.060> throttle<00:04:35.860> only<00:04:36.860> clone<00:04:37.099> state<00:04:37.460> we're

00:04:37.719 --> 00:04:37.729 
throttle throttle only clone state we're

00:04:37.729 --> 00:04:41.200 
throttle throttle only clone state we're
going<00:04:37.760> to<00:04:37.940> get<00:04:38.389> the<00:04:38.539> current<00:04:38.900> and<00:04:39.560> then<00:04:40.210> with

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:41.210 
going to get the current and then with

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:42.279 
going to get the current and then with
the<00:04:41.300> engine<00:04:41.659> not<00:04:41.870> running

00:04:42.279 --> 00:04:42.289 
the engine not running

00:04:42.289 --> 00:04:45.159 
the engine not running
put<00:04:43.099> your<00:04:43.190> foot<00:04:43.280> all<00:04:43.460> the<00:04:43.490> way<00:04:43.669> down<00:04:44.169> hundred

00:04:45.159 --> 00:04:45.169 
put your foot all the way down hundred

00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:49.480 
put your foot all the way down hundred
percent<00:04:45.470> get<00:04:46.310> current<00:04:47.050> accept<00:04:48.050> so<00:04:48.409> now<00:04:48.650> my

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:49.490 
percent get current accept so now my

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:51.700 
percent get current accept so now my
throttle<00:04:49.940> position<00:04:50.060> and<00:04:50.570> the<00:04:51.229> fuel<00:04:51.470> load

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:51.710 
throttle position and the fuel load

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:57.600 
throttle position and the fuel load
follows<00:04:52.690> naught<00:04:53.690> to<00:04:54.289> 100<00:04:54.440> percent

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:57.610 

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:02.249 

so<00:04:58.210> that's<00:04:58.509> that<00:04:58.720> calibrate<00:05:00.870> and<00:05:01.870> also

00:05:02.249 --> 00:05:02.259 
so that's that calibrate and also

00:05:02.259 --> 00:05:04.950 
so that's that calibrate and also
double-check<00:05:02.770> that<00:05:02.800> year<00:05:03.159> MF<00:05:03.960> temperature

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:04.960 
double-check that year MF temperature

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:06.240 
double-check that year MF temperature
and<00:05:05.139> your<00:05:05.229> current<00:05:05.560> temperatures<00:05:05.949> read

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:06.250 
and your current temperatures read

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:08.339 
and your current temperatures read
roughly<00:05:06.849> the<00:05:06.909> same<00:05:07.210> and<00:05:07.599> whatever<00:05:08.229> the

00:05:08.339 --> 00:05:08.349 
roughly the same and whatever the

roughly the same and whatever the
temperature<00:05:08.590> is<00:05:08.770> emit<00:05:09.039> these<00:05:09.189> really<00:05:09.460> fall<00:05:09.669> in

00:05:09.899 --> 00:05:09.909 
temperature is emit these really fall in

00:05:09.909 --> 00:05:11.969 
temperature is emit these really fall in
your<00:05:10.180> in<00:05:10.270> the<00:05:10.300> UK<00:05:10.810> certainly<00:05:11.560> this<00:05:11.740> summer

00:05:11.969 --> 00:05:11.979 
your in the UK certainly this summer

00:05:11.979 --> 00:05:16.490 
your in the UK certainly this summer
then<00:05:12.639> you<00:05:12.759> know<00:05:12.909> something<00:05:13.210> really<00:05:13.629> wrong

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:16.500 

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:21.029 

right<00:05:18.509> so<00:05:19.509> you're<00:05:20.379> just<00:05:20.500> going<00:05:20.650> to<00:05:20.680> go<00:05:20.800> through

00:05:21.029 --> 00:05:21.039

00:05:21.039 --> 00:05:28.140 
right so you're just going to go through
a<00:05:21.099> few<00:05:21.340> settings<00:05:23.729> required<00:05:24.729> fuel<00:05:27.090> this<00:05:28.090> is

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:28.150 
a few settings required fuel this is

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:32.610 
a few settings required fuel this is
what<00:05:28.479> the<00:05:28.629> ECU<00:05:29.050> uses<00:05:29.500> to<00:05:29.710> figure<00:05:30.039> out<00:05:31.259> so<00:05:32.259> the

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:32.620 
what the ECU uses to figure out so the

that's<00:07:16.450> used<00:07:16.720> in<00:07:16.870> the<00:07:16.960> calculation<00:07:17.560> so<00:07:18.090> as

00:07:27.930 --> 00:07:27.940 
values of forty or 1 then this you've

00:07:27.940 --> 00:07:29.220
