00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:14.740
 and this all started through the hobbit 

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:16.630
 with a group of friends to practice the 

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:19.360
 mountain biking with the passing of 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:22.270
 years we realized that this could 

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:23.890
 be a training school we started to 

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:25.390
 work with children we follow and all the 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:28.990
 priority of working with children and with 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:30.580
 young people and what he started now is a 

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:32.559
 informative educational program 

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:35.760
 especially with children and with young people 

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:35.760
 of the retirement municipality 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:57.469
 they invited me 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:01:00.379
 and I saw that it was a beautiful experience 

00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:02.120
 and I wanted to go back and we're happy 

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:04.339
 for example this school they were in 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:08.060
 roadrunners I share many with 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:11.270
 friends I also get many new ones and 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:15.430
 calm down by being more and more athletic and 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:15.430
 It is also very good for health 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:29.399
 we benefit annually about 1000 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:32.399
 people 120 of them are in the part 

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:34.890
 recreational and sports are distributed 

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:35.759
 in 5 groups that go children from 5 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.630
 years 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:38.630
 onwards 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.109
 none of them pays a monthly payment 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:54.750
 an inscription is not just me 

00:01:52.109 --> 00:01:57.090
 get closer to the desire to ride 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:59.549
 that are studying the child that is not 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:03.920
 studying we can not have it if there is not 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:03.920
 there is a good academic result 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:12.830
 me encouraged me by my dear little friend 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:16.240
 home and I talked with raise myself then 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:16.240
 he has received me very cordially 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:22.770
 I think the experience is very bacano 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:25.560
 good because one does not always teach 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:30.060
 to win to win and win but to know 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:32.450
 lose teach you values ​​from very 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.450
 low 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:40.640
 We have 50 bicycles and helmets for 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:42.650
 lend to children that they do not have is 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:44.870
 simply what they do is they go to 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:46.579
 do it here they take her bicycle and 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:49.120
 after each training they have a 

00:02:46.579 --> 00:02:49.120
 refreshment 

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:58.980
 I love challenges I love the 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:02.450
 cycling i love to practice a sport 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:02.450
 and it's not around without doing it 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:13.700
 prayer we train twice a week 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:17.019
 and every time he does not meet with everyone 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:17.019
 It is very good up 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:21.069
 so there is no there there is one that 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:22.780
 decide in the next course 

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:24.579
 because they always have new things to 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:26.879
 always teach us one learns everything 

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:26.879
 new 

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:35.190
 we have three programs the program the 

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:37.020
 love bike school donated 1600 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:38.940

 one of the largest schools that 

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:52.860
 has the country at this time we have 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:55.050
 two boys based in italy so 

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:56.310
 generally 50 to 70 percent of the 

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:59.600
 Colombian elections are with 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:59.600
 members of our corporation 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:06.870

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:10.470
 be like him being champion like him when 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:15.769
 big wanted to travel and carve player 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:15.769
 paris and I saw all the mattresses 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:22.680
 a professional cyclist 

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:26.050
 I would like to also know 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:28.810
 a good cyclist and to be able to get 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:30.920
 much farther than our peers 

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:33.500
 they are in europe 

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:37.080
 we have a program that is the school of 

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:40.949
 bicycle mechanics 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:42.870
 we have teachers who are also from 

00:04:40.949 --> 00:04:45.590
 same club that teach us especially in 

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:45.590
 the bicycles 

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:56.199
 we have a productive project that is a 

00:04:53.389 --> 00:04:59.990
 bicycle workshop and whoever is 

00:04:56.199 --> 00:05:03.550
 better is learning a lot goes to the 

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:05.980
 workshop and start to win 

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:08.410
 a little money for what he does and already 

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:11.640
 you can hold one and it's in the study 

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:11.640
 and that following the vision 

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:17.630
 how I managed to reinforce all this work 

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:19.520
 social that we have in retirement thanks 

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:21.350
 to private enterprise among companies 

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:24.470
 who help us and the foundations 

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:26.420
 these Suarez this recognized company of 

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:29.330
 uniforms comes to help you from 

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:31.010
 two years ago through uniforms for 

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:32.780
 the children who are starting and also 

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:34.520
 with the good discounts in the 

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:36.410
 uniforms that we do competition 

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:38.630
 for a group of approximately 100 

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:40.640
 boys, this has been a fundamental pillar 

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:43.090
 to encourage our children and 

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:43.090
 Our youth 

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:54.810
 the main objective and the dream more 

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:57.230
 great that we have in roadrunners is 

00:05:54.810 --> 00:06:02.180
 see these children turned into adults 

00:05:57.230 --> 00:06:02.180
 useful to society that move forward 

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:12.770
 we go very far with all this and I'm 

00:06:10.669 --> 00:06:15.050
 sure we will continue to train children 

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:17.229
 forming young people and having a better 

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:17.229
 society
