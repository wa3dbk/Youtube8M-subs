00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.800
Today I will be making mushroom corn cashew curry.

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.200
Mushrooms and corn cooked in spicy tomato cashew gravy.

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:22.700
Cashew adds a creamy and rich texture to this delicious main dish.

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:25.520
This is a quick and easy recipe.

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:30.440
This dish goes well with any Indian flat bread or plain rice.

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:33.420
This recipe will serve 2-3.

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:36.280
To make this dish we will need:

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:39.200
3 cups of sliced mushroom

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:41.340
1 cup of corn kernels

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.900
I am using the frozen corn kernels.

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:45.960
For gravy we will need

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:48.190
2 cups of chopped tomatoes

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:50.460
1/4 cup of cashews

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:53.300
1 tablespoon of chopped ginger

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:55.900
And 1 tablespoon of chopped green chilli

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:57.840
For seasoning

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.900
2 tablespoons of oil

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:03.330
1/2 teaspoon of cumin seed (jeera)

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:07.100
1/8 teaspoon of asafoetida (hing)

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.640
1/4 teaspoon of turmeric (haldi)

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:14.380
1/4 teaspoon of chilli powder (lal mirch)

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:17.840
2 teaspoons of coriander powder (dhania)

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:19.979
1 teaspoon of salt

00:01:20.289 --> 00:01:21.669
and for garnishing

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:25.640
about 2 tablespoons of chopped cilantro (hara dhania)

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.370
This is a very simple recipe.

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:33.660
First I will blend tomato and cashew together to make a paste

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:38.371
and then season the paste to prepare the gravy.

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:45.479
After gravy is ready, I will add the mushroom and corn in the gravy

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:46.970
and cook till it is ready.

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:50.680
First I will grind the cashews.

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:54.380
For few seconds.

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:02.120
Cashews have became almost a powder.

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.529
Now I am going to add the green chilli.

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:07.100
Ginger

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:09.120
And tomatoes.

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:14.880
Blend it together to make a fine paste.

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:28.440
It is done. I almost blended this for a minute.

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.040
It looks good, just like a paste.

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:37.120
So now I am ready to season it.

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:39.800
Heat is on, medium high.

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:40.940
Oil

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:44.940
And let’s wait till oil is moderately hot.

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:47.500
It should take almost a minute.

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.480
Cumin seeds (jeera)

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:52.400
Asafoetida

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:58.420
And as it cracks, now we are going to put the tomato paste.

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:02.120
Add turmeric

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:04.140
Red chilli

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:06.280
Coriander powder

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:07.940
And salt.

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.720
Mix it.

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:19.380
And stir occasionally and cook till the spices and the

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:21.880
paste starts leaving the sides of the pan.

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:26.200
This should take about 3 minutes.

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:28.900
Spice mix is ready.

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:33.520
As you see it has start leaving the side and you can see the oil.

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:36.240
It has taken me about 3 minutes.

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:38.780
Make sure you do stir it.

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:42.060
Now we are going to add the mushrooms.

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:43.820
And corn.

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:47.720
Mix it together.

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:54.120
This is all mixed and it has a very nice aroma.

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:58.180
And now I am going to add the water about 1.5 cups.

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:04.240
Let the gravy come to boil

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:08.080
and then we are going to lower the heat to medium.

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:13.480
Gravy has come to boil and I will reduce the heat to medium.

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:19.260
Cover the pan, let it cook till mushrooms are tender.

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.300
This should take about 8 minutes.

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:25.439
This has been about 10 minutes.

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:27.900
So let’s check.

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:32.820
Mushrooms are looking very tender

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:36.200
and gravy is looking very nice and thick.

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:41.220
I am going to add the green cilantro and just mix it.

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:47.620
It gives a nice flavor and gives nice color to the dish.

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:52.040
Mushroom corn cashew curry is ready.

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:57.400
