the net you see my racket is parallel to

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:50.790 
the net you see my racket is parallel to
than<00:00:49.059> that<00:00:49.179> it's<00:00:49.329> not<00:00:49.510> tilted<00:00:49.899> here<00:00:50.230> that

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:50.800 
than that it's not tilted here that

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:52.439 
than that it's not tilted here that
would<00:00:50.920> cause<00:00:51.070> it<00:00:51.100> to<00:00:51.309> hit<00:00:51.429> the<00:00:51.460> fence<00:00:51.699> and<00:00:52.269> it's

00:00:52.439 --> 00:00:52.449 
would cause it to hit the fence and it's

00:00:52.449 --> 00:00:54.119 
would cause it to hit the fence and it's
not<00:00:52.659> tilted<00:00:53.050> down<00:00:53.230> that<00:00:53.589> would<00:00:53.710> cause<00:00:53.890> it<00:00:54.039> has

00:00:54.119 --> 00:00:54.129 
not tilted down that would cause it has

00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:55.829 
not tilted down that would cause it has
been<00:00:54.309> straight<00:00:54.579> down<00:00:54.730> into<00:00:54.940> the<00:00:55.030> floor<00:00:55.239> this
