00:02:28.259 --> 00:02:28.269 
fiber looks so good so we get closer

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:35.570 
fiber looks so good so we get closer
look<00:02:28.420> at<00:02:28.510> that

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:06.400 
I'd let you see the first stage of

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:09.539 
I'd let you see the first stage of
transformation<00:03:07.209> before<00:03:07.720> like<00:03:08.019> I<00:03:08.170> say<00:03:08.409> I<00:03:08.680> send

00:03:09.539 --> 00:03:09.549 
transformation before like I say I send

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:13.039 
transformation before like I say I send
it<00:03:09.730> deep<00:03:10.659> into<00:03:10.870> the<00:03:11.109> heart<00:03:11.230> of<00:03:11.409> Texas

00:03:13.039 --> 00:03:13.049 
it deep into the heart of Texas

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:15.089 
it deep into the heart of Texas
hopefully<00:03:14.049> it<00:03:14.200> won't<00:03:14.379> take<00:03:14.469> me<00:03:14.799> a<00:03:14.829> bit<00:03:14.859> about

00:03:15.089 --> 00:03:15.099 
hopefully it won't take me a bit about

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:16.940 
hopefully it won't take me a bit about
two<00:03:15.430> weeks<00:03:15.579> to<00:03:15.760> get<00:03:15.909> it<00:03:15.970> back<00:03:16.209> though<00:03:16.480> so

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:16.950 
two weeks to get it back though so

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:20.520 
two weeks to get it back though so
that's<00:03:17.950> her<00:03:18.099> hopefully<00:03:19.090> our<00:03:19.120> plan<00:03:19.599> you<00:03:20.439> know

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:20.530 
that's her hopefully our plan you know
