00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:08.730
 How about dear friends of 'youtube' 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:10.719
 my name is green out 

00:00:10.719 --> 00:00:13.610
 I come to talk about the influenza virus 

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:17.980
 I know it is a subject of little interest to some however 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:22.360
 there are things that people do not know about the virus and about the terrible advantages 

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:24.239
 this presents 

00:00:24.239 --> 00:00:27.969
 I'm going to talk about its morphological properties which are the modifications 

00:00:27.969 --> 00:00:32.649
 and transformations that physiognomic skehel presents its physical appearance 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.210
 and physiological that are its functions I would like to share this information 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.230
 since it is very interesting and clear important 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:46.820
 the virus is of the mex or virus type since they are constituted by a chain of 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:47.580
 art 

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:52.730
 e md and camps and of symmetry the ico go to the presented subunits that is the 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:55.450
 hemagglutinin and neuraminidase 

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:59.870
 hemagglutinin is a glucose antigenic protein that is found 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:04.119
 on the surface of the virus and has a structure characterized by rods 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:09.280
 The crazy proteins are molecules composed of a protein and 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:12.340
 antigens refers to having opposite properties 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:17.980
 to neuraminidase is in the capsid or core capsid of the virus is 

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:21.880
 heterogeneous and has the function of breaking the molecular bond between 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:25.770
 morning and sialic acid which is an acid monosaccharide 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:29.460
 but because it was believed to be and if it is 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.460
 this is done for three main reasons 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.100
 the binding of hemagglutinin and sialic acid allows the virus to enter 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:38.780
 in a target cell 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:40.329
 the new virions 

00:01:40.329 --> 00:01:42.260
 produced inside the cell 

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.570
 when leaving, they remain bound to it at the level of sialic acid 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:49.760
 thanks to the fact that neuraminidase breaks the molecular bond 

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:53.960
 these virions can detach from the cell and replicate within other 

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:59.580
 a virion a morphologically complete and infectious virus particle 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:03.649
 the released virions are coated with sialic acid 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:08.890
 neuraminidase helps to remove this acid from the surface of the vibrio 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:12.039
 to prevent them from adding to each other 

00:02:12.039 --> 00:02:15.429
 the mucus of the respiratory system is rich in sialic acid 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:20.260
 what makes the hemagglutinin molecules and therefore the cridem virus 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:21.619
 stuck to him 

00:02:21.619 --> 00:02:22.879
 here again to 

00:02:22.879 --> 00:02:24.359
 you to the neuraminidase 

00:02:24.359 --> 00:02:27.659
 that by breaking the liberal union by the organism to the trapped virus 

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:32.799
 this can give us an idea of ​​the non-destructive units of this 

00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:33.389
 virus 

00:02:33.389 --> 00:02:36.719
 They work together to finally put us in terminal phase 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:38.260
 but nevertheless 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:39.989
 we can fight against it 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:44.230
 there are ways to fight it with other antigen compounds 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:49.430
 as he does not say sodium sulfate this compound surfactants dissociates by means 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:50.069
 of scripts 

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:54.209
 molecules or substances when dissolved and used in hygiene products 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:58.209
 personal like toothpaste shampoo and bath soaps 

00:02:59.189 --> 00:03:04.809
 the hemagglutinin once dispersed is a and worthy this means they are bodies 

00:03:04.809 --> 00:03:08.959
 simple and have only one free valence so you can join the red blood cells 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:11.100
 what are the red blood cells 

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:13.389
 but it is not capable of agglutinating the 

00:03:13.389 --> 00:03:18.109
 once it eliminates aldo say sodium sulfate the semar lüthi mine secrete 

00:03:18.109 --> 00:03:22.239
 radial groups pointed like a multivalent rod 

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:24.709
 and they produce the morning action 

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:28.079
 after the elimination of not saying sodium sulfate 

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:33.149
 the neuraminidase subunits are added forming wheel-shaped structures 

00:03:33.649 --> 00:03:37.729
 however the units of newham and sights have enzymatic activity 

00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:42.039
 whether they are isolated or focus in aggregate form 

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:47.430
 how the properties of these two subunits can be explained 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:50.499
 Our organism circulates in an extraordinary way 

00:03:50.499 --> 00:03:53.639
 fulfilling only destructive functions 

00:03:53.639 --> 00:03:55.449
 from young cells 

00:03:55.449 --> 00:03:57.829
 up to our own blood 

00:03:57.829 --> 00:04:00.209
 and what does this create 

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:03.519
 in the nasopharynx they spread to sensitive cells 

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:05.919
 by contacting 

00:04:05.919 --> 00:04:09.269
 combine with viral particles 

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:14.249
 the time period if acute lasts less than five days semi acute more than 

00:04:14.249 --> 00:04:17.639
 a week and chronic more than a month or a year 

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:20.310
 If the person has many defenses 

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:24.639
 the fight is still inside while the guest has a slight cold 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:30.470
 at a systematic level it attacks the membranes to the red blood cells and arrives 

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:32.189
 the multifaceted 

00:04:32.189 --> 00:04:36.979
 Infections can be mild with short incubation periods 

00:04:36.979 --> 00:04:38.870
 but they are very infectious 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:41.029
 this causes them to spread 

00:04:41.029 --> 00:04:43.729
 they frequently invade the whole world 

00:04:43.729 --> 00:04:47.139
 every four years there is an epidemic of the type 

00:04:47.139 --> 00:04:51.250
 now that they listen in health alert that according to we are in yellow 

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:56.440
 I would actually consider that we are already in red however I would not prefer 

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:57.300
 alarm 

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:00.300
 just have some precautions 

00:05:00.839 --> 00:05:01.979
 the groups to 

00:05:01.979 --> 00:05:05.069
 they usually cover larger areas and be more serious 

00:05:05.069 --> 00:05:08.069
 mortality is more towards young people 

00:05:08.949 --> 00:05:11.949
 now its physical and chemical characteristics 

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:17.400
 the intact spherical particles contain approximately 0 

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:21.409
 75 to 0 9% of rn 

00:05:21.409 --> 00:05:24.139
 75 percent protein 

00:05:24.139 --> 00:05:25.040
 a 6 

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:29.010
 5 percent carbohydrates and 18 percent lipids 

00:05:30.259 --> 00:05:31.979
 thanks for your attention 

00:05:31.979 --> 00:05:36.539
 I hope this information can be useful for you, have a nice day and 

00:05:36.539 --> 00:05:37.050
 see you later
