00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:12.460
 today we will see how the squid are fished 

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:14.559
 To begin, let's determine the time 

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:17.140
 departure is essential to leave early in the morning 

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:19.000
 for so far together with the sunset are 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:21.450
 the two most active moments for 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.450
 the squids 

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:26.330
 one of the basic preliminaries is 

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:28.130
 charge our ultraviolet light 

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:30.260
 birds and leads as they come 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:32.780
 provided with a luminescent paint 

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:34.280
 that along with the black light will be charged 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:37.760
 right away and they will draw more attention 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:40.040
 underwater know where they are 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:41.809
 squid is paramount and for this 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:45.100
 the simplest thing is to follow the 

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:45.100
 fishermen with experiences 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:51.050
 i 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:57.170
 but if you think we start with the 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.170
 theory of how they are fished for more 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:08.469
 [Music] 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:10.899
 let's start with the assembly are usually 

00:01:08.469 --> 00:01:12.640
 ride two birds of a lead but 

00:01:10.899 --> 00:01:16.550
 there are different ways to mount them 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:20.690
 let's see first the most traditional 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:22.610
 this consists of a little bird united by 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:24.890
 a piece of flower or carbon to a pearlite 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:26.780
 and this in turn when cutting up and 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:29.090
 down by two barrel knots which 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:30.890
 will allow oscillating movement without 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:33.370
 no such problem and as we see in 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:33.370
 the images 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:38.740
 this other one against we see that it is a 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:40.360
 different mount in this case there is no 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:43.299
 single carbon piece that separates the 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:45.880
 little birds but they are simply helped 

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:48.250
 to a yellow that is bounded by two 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:50.110
 plastic pieces that make the top of 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:52.060
 way that they allow the oscillation of a 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:54.909
 different mode to the previous 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:57.970
 I advise to use pot covers which 

00:01:54.909 --> 00:01:59.409
 makes the management of these 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:01.920
 devilish little birds that all 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:01.920
 hook 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:09.170
 [Music] 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:10.520
 once a day put into flour if we go to 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:13.340
 talk about the canes we will have to 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:15.470
 use very light action rods because 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:18.080
 the leads that are usually used are usually 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:24.710
 be between 70 and 150 grams depending 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:26.720
 of the drift as we see the action of the 

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:28.520
 cane is very soft which is going to 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:32.260
 help the movement not be 

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:32.260
 violent or always very rhythmic 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:36.970
 we can see two different movements 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:39.100
 the one on the cane on the left I'm 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:41.110
 performing with your hands while the 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:43.420
 of the cane of the right practically 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:45.280
 it does not move is the movement it makes is 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:47.590
 simply the cane resting on the 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:49.180
 pneumatic ball in this way 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:51.220
 It is also very practical and there are people who 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:52.880
 comes to fish with three and four rods 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:56.220
 one person 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:56.220
 [Music] 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:01.920
 the wrist movement as we said 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:03.840
 it is essential that it be slow slowly 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:04.690
 so that the animal gives them time to 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:07.819
 engage 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:07.819
 [Music] 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:18.480
 to see when the minced cane 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:21.000
 double a little more than normal never 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:23.250
 is an excessive achievement since the 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.290
 animals are not very big but it is 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:28.220
 enough for the fisherman to be 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:28.220
 able to detect it 

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:34.790
 we will always keep the squids 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:37.220
 in the fridge with clean, closed water 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:39.160
 so that the heat does not spoil them today 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:41.960
 Our dear friend Aitor accompanies us 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:43.370
 we went fishing with scuba is a 

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:45.860
 company that among other things has 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:47.690
 rental boats we go out by 

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:50.390
 a boat of 8 meters and a half that 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:53.180
 facilitates but also known by the 

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:57.100
 friends as they were already a great guy and which 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:57.100
 We will laugh at this day fishing 

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:02.400
 and as not if dinator could not 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:19.860
 miss when your father a great fisherman 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:21.600
 and best friend once we notice that 

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:24.630
 come fish the crank pickup 

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:27.420
 should always be slow if possible 

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:29.670
 It is advised to use a saucer or 

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:32.690
 sacdera that greatly facilitates the 

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:32.690
 fish collection 

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:46.599
 [Music] 

00:04:44.529 --> 00:04:48.609
 this time we see how the reel of 

00:04:46.599 --> 00:04:50.559
 Jeronimo goes up easy from the toe 

00:04:48.609 --> 00:04:53.969
 is well flexed which wants 

00:04:50.559 --> 00:04:53.969
 say that they bring evil face 

00:04:55.120 --> 00:05:00.030
 this time we see the squid but not 

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:02.080
 we have a hip which makes 

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:06.190
 unfortunately at the moment of taking it out 

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:08.020
 of the water slips and escapes with this 

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:10.360
 underwater camera we can see what is the 

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:12.190
 natural and ideal movement that they have 

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:20.860
 have to make the birds to be able 

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:23.440
 fish depth will depend on each 

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:25.870
 day rule is usually fish 

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:28.180
 more in the background and half water or in 

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:30.540
 surface anyway this should be 

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:33.230
 to try every day 

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:37.420
 [Music] 

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:41.130
 we see in this case a rise of squid 

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:41.130
 as it does not offer any resistance 

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:48.289
 and as we mentioned by the 

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:50.710
 We guarantee that there is no 

00:05:48.289 --> 00:05:50.710
 no mistake 

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:02.640
 [Music] 

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:10.930
 [Music] 

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:15.890
 good friends I hope these brief 

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:19.340
 notions about how squid is fished 

00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:21.910
 encourage you to go out and try your luck and 

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:21.910
 good fishing
