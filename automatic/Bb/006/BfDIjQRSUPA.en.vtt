know what chemical process happens but
it<00:04:43.560> makes<00:04:43.710> it<00:04:43.860> so<00:04:43.919> it's<00:04:44.250> smooth<00:04:45.030> again<00:04:45.620> and

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:46.620 
it makes it so it's smooth again and

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:50.120 
it makes it so it's smooth again and
that's<00:04:47.490> smooth<00:04:47.760> enough<00:04:48.030> that<00:04:48.810> we<00:04:49.500> can<00:04:49.710> drizzle

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:50.130 
that's smooth enough that we can drizzle

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:52.070 
that's smooth enough that we can drizzle
this<00:04:50.370> over<00:04:50.550> the<00:04:50.790> top<00:04:50.970> so<00:04:51.570> I<00:04:51.600> just<00:04:51.750> put<00:04:51.870> it<00:04:51.960> into

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:52.080 
this over the top so I just put it into

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:54.830 
this over the top so I just put it into
a<00:04:52.169> sandwich<00:04:52.950> bag<00:04:53.190> like<00:04:53.400> that<00:04:53.430> I'm<00:04:54.389> going<00:04:54.660> to

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:54.840 
a sandwich bag like that I'm going to

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:57.650 
a sandwich bag like that I'm going to
snip<00:04:55.770> off<00:04:55.889> the<00:04:56.070> corner<00:04:56.460> and<00:04:57.210> hope<00:04:57.389> that<00:04:57.540> it

00:04:57.650 --> 00:04:57.660 
snip off the corner and hope that it

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:01.280 
snip off the corner and hope that it
doesn't<00:04:57.690> land<00:04:58.169> in<00:04:58.350> the<00:04:58.530> truffles<00:04:59.479> and<00:05:00.479> you<00:05:01.169> can

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:01.290 
doesn't land in the truffles and you can

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:03.590 
doesn't land in the truffles and you can
flavor<00:05:01.560> this<00:05:01.830> drizzle<00:05:02.820> if<00:05:02.940> you<00:05:03.030> want<00:05:03.240> with

flavor this drizzle if you want with
