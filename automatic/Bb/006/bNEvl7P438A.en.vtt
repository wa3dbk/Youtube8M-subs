00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
pretty much better battery life better

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:27.620 
pretty much better battery life better
performance<00:00:26.119> there's<00:00:27.119> actually<00:00:27.510> no

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630

if I review this one I think this was

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.770 
if I review this one I think this was

reviewing 1.2 so this one you can kind

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.520 
reviewing 1.2 so this one you can kind
of<00:00:43.649> change<00:00:43.980> the<00:00:44.610> scenario<00:00:45.020> let's<00:00:46.020> say<00:00:46.230> you<00:00:46.289> I

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
of change the scenario let's say you I

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.190 
of change the scenario let's say you I
and<00:00:47.039> then<00:00:47.910> you<00:00:48.059> can<00:00:48.239> set<00:00:48.539> the<00:00:48.719> mode<00:00:48.870> right<00:00:49.140> now

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
and then you can set the mode right now

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.049 
and then you can set the mode right now
its<00:00:49.469> standard<00:00:49.860> you<00:00:50.039> can<00:00:50.160> sell<00:00:50.370> it<00:00:50.399> set<00:00:50.789> it<00:00:50.910> to

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
its standard you can sell it set it to

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:55.610 
its standard you can sell it set it to
dynamic<00:00:53.120> natural<00:00:54.120> so<00:00:54.539> change<00:00:54.809> the<00:00:54.989> colors<00:00:55.350> a

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
dynamic natural so change the colors a

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.540 
dynamic natural so change the colors a
little<00:00:55.860> bit<00:00:56.300> um<00:00:57.300> I<00:00:57.870> also<00:00:58.800> all<00:00:59.070> these<00:00:59.250> stuff

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
little bit um I also all these stuff

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:04.579 
little bit um I also all these stuff
outdoor<00:01:00.000> mode<00:01:01.129> touch<00:01:02.129> sensitivity<00:01:03.589> radio

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
outdoor mode touch sensitivity radio

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:09.560 
outdoor mode touch sensitivity radio
sensors<00:01:05.489> um<00:01:06.920> pretty<00:01:07.920> cool<00:01:08.250> there<00:01:08.760> and<00:01:09.000> rom

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
sensors um pretty cool there and rom

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.130 
sensors um pretty cool there and rom
control<00:01:10.049> of<00:01:10.320> course<00:01:10.680> um<00:01:11.510> allows<00:01:12.510> you<00:01:12.689> do<00:01:12.810> a<00:01:12.840> lot

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
control of course um allows you do a lot

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.929 
control of course um allows you do a lot
of<00:01:13.170> stuff<00:01:14.180> general<00:01:15.180> you<00:01:15.420> I<00:01:15.860> LCD<00:01:16.860> density<00:01:17.220> and

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
of stuff general you I LCD density and

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:21.249 
of stuff general you I LCD density and
change<00:01:18.240> the<00:01:18.390> LCD<00:01:18.570> density<00:01:18.920> make<00:01:19.920> it<00:01:20.070> into<00:01:20.369> arm

00:01:21.249 --> 00:01:21.259 
change the LCD density make it into arm

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:26.350 
change the LCD density make it into arm
what<00:01:22.259> is<00:01:22.350> it<00:01:22.520> like<00:01:23.520> a<00:01:24.000> tablet<00:01:24.270> UI<00:01:25.259> if<00:01:25.530> you<00:01:25.650> want

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:26.360 
what is it like a tablet UI if you want

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:31.450 
what is it like a tablet UI if you want
um<00:01:27.360> so<00:01:29.119> oops

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:31.460 
um so oops

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:34.390 
um so oops
so<00:01:32.299> that's<00:01:32.600> this<00:01:32.930> pretty<00:01:33.409> much<00:01:33.560> it<00:01:33.950> i<00:01:33.979> think

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:34.400 
so that's this pretty much it i think

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:36.730 
so that's this pretty much it i think
and<00:01:34.670> you<00:01:34.820> get<00:01:34.940> the<00:01:35.119> standard<00:01:35.479> DSP<00:01:36.290> manager

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:36.740 
and you get the standard DSP manager

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:40.630 
and you get the standard DSP manager
what's<00:01:36.979> different<00:01:37.430> from<00:01:37.490> 1.2<00:01:38.119> to<00:01:38.420> 1.7<00:01:39.640> for

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:40.640 
what's different from 1.2 to 1.7 for

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:44.710 
what's different from 1.2 to 1.7 for
video<00:01:40.909> recording<00:01:40.990> you<00:01:41.990> do<00:01:42.200> get<00:01:42.440> the<00:01:43.509> you<00:01:44.509> get

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:44.720 
video recording you do get the you get

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:50.710 
video recording you do get the you get
mp4<00:01:45.680> files<00:01:45.979> instead<00:01:46.369> of<00:01:46.490> 3gp<00:01:47.150> and<00:01:47.900> also<00:01:49.720> you

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:50.720 
mp4 files instead of 3gp and also you

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:52.570 
mp4 files instead of 3gp and also you
can<00:01:50.899> play<00:01:51.170> with<00:01:51.440> these<00:01:51.619> extra<00:01:52.070> settings<00:01:52.430> here

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:52.580 
can play with these extra settings here

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:54.370 
can play with these extra settings here
now<00:01:52.790> you<00:01:53.360> can<00:01:53.509> actually<00:01:53.960> store<00:01:54.170> it<00:01:54.259> to

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:54.380 
now you can actually store it to

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:56.620 
now you can actually store it to
external<00:01:54.860> SD<00:01:55.159> power<00:01:55.520> shuttle<00:01:56.060> shutter

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:56.630 
external SD power shuttle shutter

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:00.280 
external SD power shuttle shutter
shutter<00:01:57.880> store<00:01:58.880> location<00:01:59.570> you<00:01:59.659> can<00:01:59.780> set<00:02:00.050> where

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:00.290 
shutter store location you can set where

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:02.830 
shutter store location you can set where
you<00:02:00.409> want<00:02:00.619> to<00:02:00.710> store<00:02:00.950> it<00:02:01.009> um<00:02:01.580> so<00:02:02.060> now<00:02:02.210> if<00:02:02.270> I<00:02:02.690> want

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:02.840 
you want to store it um so now if I want

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.260 
you want to store it um so now if I want
to<00:02:02.869> take<00:02:02.990> a<00:02:03.020> photo<00:02:03.380> I<00:02:04.190> can<00:02:04.729> use<00:02:04.850> my<00:02:04.880> power

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:05.270 
to take a photo I can use my power

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:09.370 
to take a photo I can use my power
button<00:02:06.729> so<00:02:07.729> which<00:02:08.000> is<00:02:08.030> kind<00:02:08.390> of<00:02:08.450> cool<00:02:08.509> just<00:02:09.259> a

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:09.380 
button so which is kind of cool just a

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:11.110 
button so which is kind of cool just a
small<00:02:09.590> feature<00:02:09.920> that's<00:02:10.220> been<00:02:10.489> upgraded<00:02:10.940> but

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:11.120 
small feature that's been upgraded but

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.150 
small feature that's been upgraded but
its<00:02:11.269> prequel<00:02:11.989> it's<00:02:12.560> supposed<00:02:12.830> to<00:02:12.890> give<00:02:13.010> you<00:02:13.100> a
