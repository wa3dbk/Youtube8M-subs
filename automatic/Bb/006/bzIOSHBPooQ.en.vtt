that's the antennas for all this if you

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:05.090 
that's the antennas for all this if you
can<00:05:04.440> see<00:05:04.590> them<00:05:04.740> up<00:05:04.860> there

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:05.100

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:13.650 
it but the antennas for this thing are

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:17.900 
it but the antennas for this thing are
all<00:05:13.830> in<00:05:13.920> these<00:05:14.070> little<00:05:14.280> clear<00:05:16.730> it's<00:05:17.730> almost

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:17.910 
all in these little clear it's almost

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:20.750 
all in these little clear it's almost
like<00:05:18.180> a<00:05:18.240> cell<00:05:18.420> phone<00:05:18.630> screen<00:05:19.170> protector<00:05:19.830> and

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:20.760 
like a cell phone screen protector and

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:22.100 
like a cell phone screen protector and
I'm<00:05:20.910> touching<00:05:21.270> it<00:05:21.330> right<00:05:21.510> here<00:05:21.720> it's<00:05:21.960> like<00:05:22.050> a

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:22.110 
I'm touching it right here it's like a

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:23.660 
I'm touching it right here it's like a
screen<00:05:22.470> protector<00:05:22.620> over<00:05:23.070> the<00:05:23.280> top<00:05:23.460> of<00:05:23.490> the

screen protector over the top of the
window<00:05:23.940> with<00:05:24.090> this<00:05:24.210> little<00:05:24.720> tiny<00:05:25.020> tiny

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:25.440 
window with this little tiny tiny

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:27.530 
window with this little tiny tiny
monofilament<00:05:26.130> wire<00:05:26.580> buried<00:05:27.000> in<00:05:27.120> it<00:05:27.270> and<00:05:27.420> I'm

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:27.540 
monofilament wire buried in it and I'm

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:30.620 
monofilament wire buried in it and I'm
tracing<00:05:27.810> it<00:05:28.050> right<00:05:28.680> now<00:05:28.920> that's<00:05:29.400> how<00:05:29.630> almost

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:30.630 
tracing it right now that's how almost

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:32.450 
tracing it right now that's how almost
impossible<00:05:31.110> it<00:05:31.170> is<00:05:31.260> to<00:05:31.320> see<00:05:31.590> I'm<00:05:32.190> actually

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:32.460 
impossible it is to see I'm actually

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:34.550 
impossible it is to see I'm actually
touching<00:05:32.790> it<00:05:33.060> and<00:05:33.150> tracing<00:05:33.540> it<00:05:33.630> there's<00:05:34.260> some

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:34.560 
touching it and tracing it there's some

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:36.830 
touching it and tracing it there's some
this<00:05:35.310> one's<00:05:35.550> shaped<00:05:35.610> like<00:05:35.970> a<00:05:36.000> C<00:05:36.330> and<00:05:36.540> then

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:36.840 
this one's shaped like a C and then

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:39.170 
this one's shaped like a C and then
there's<00:05:37.050> like<00:05:37.430> three<00:05:38.430> more<00:05:38.700> that<00:05:39.030> are

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:39.180 
there's like three more that are

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:41.240 
there's like three more that are
rectangular<00:05:39.990> all<00:05:40.350> the<00:05:40.470> way<00:05:40.530> across<00:05:40.740> the<00:05:41.040> car

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:41.250 
rectangular all the way across the car

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:51.500 
rectangular all the way across the car
and

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:51.510 

00:05:51.510 --> 00:06:01.980 

perhaps<00:05:52.510> you<00:05:52.630> can<00:05:52.750> see<00:05:52.810> this<00:05:53.110> and<00:06:00.840> here's<00:06:01.840> the

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:01.990 
perhaps you can see this and here's the

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:08.630 
perhaps you can see this and here's the
hard<00:06:02.140> drive<00:06:02.440> back<00:06:02.680> here<00:06:03.040> and<00:06:05.490> what<00:06:06.490> is<00:06:06.730> it<00:06:06.850> a

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:08.640 
hard drive back here and what is it a

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:11.250 
hard drive back here and what is it a
hard<00:06:09.640> disk<00:06:09.880> I<00:06:10.000> guess<00:06:10.120> this<00:06:10.270> is<00:06:10.390> the<00:06:10.480> GPS<00:06:10.660> I

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:11.260 
hard disk I guess this is the GPS I

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:12.780 
hard disk I guess this is the GPS I
don't<00:06:11.620> I<00:06:11.770> have<00:06:11.980> no<00:06:12.160> idea<00:06:12.400> what<00:06:12.520> that<00:06:12.550> is

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:12.790 
don't I have no idea what that is

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:13.860 
don't I have no idea what that is
something<00:06:13.000> I'm<00:06:13.090> gonna<00:06:13.240> bother<00:06:13.450> with<00:06:13.600> it<00:06:13.750> like

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:13.870 
something I'm gonna bother with it like

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:20.160 
something I'm gonna bother with it like
I<00:06:13.900> said<00:06:14.140> I<00:06:14.230> can't<00:06:14.440> even<00:06:14.620> understand<00:06:15.310> it<00:06:15.400> so<00:06:19.170> so

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:20.170 
I said I can't even understand it so so
