00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:04.490
 we continue with more pitch fields from and we continue talking about livestock 

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:08.270
 repeatedly we hear that the technicians talk about that nutrition 

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:13.070
 This is one of the main factors that affect the improvement of 

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:14.309
 production 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:17.939
 and also on this subject the brave doctor spoke in the framework of 

00:00:17.939 --> 00:00:23.349
 last expo north conception and the example that was known grains summarizes the 

00:00:23.349 --> 00:00:26.349
 technical guidance on this subject 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:34.290
 within the framework of the twentieth edition of the northern expo 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.910
 Dr. Oscar Brave gave a technical talk on supplementation of 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.060
 beef cattle grazing 

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:46.300
 the professional manifested and the feeding is one of the factors of 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:49.840
 production that most affects the performance of livestock 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:55.230
 the base of the feeding of our means is the pasture but it is very seasonal 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.100
 and the nutritional requirements are important so the 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.100
 seasonal supplementation is a valid alternative 

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:08.580
 and supplementation was important in Paraguay and fundamentally in the 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.610
 era of the forage crisis we know what happens periodically and it 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:15.350
 repeats year after year during 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:16.710
 winter 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.079
 so 

00:01:18.079 --> 00:01:22.530
 To face this crisis situation, supplementation is important 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:27.530
 fundamentally in that category of livestock that need it most, which are 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:30.060
 the animals that are growing 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.450
 or those that are the production or 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:34.320
 i 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.830
 supplementation obviously has a number of objectives not 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:40.940
 one the fundamental thing is to keep the animal load 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:44.650
 in an establishment if it is inferred that it is 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:46.650
 the minimum 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:51.460
 i also like a handling tool in such a way not to spoil a lot 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:52.970
 the astur 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:58.030
 and on the other hand also to achieve weight gain or fresh and I other 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:00.660
 late 

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:04.750
 will end before the animals said that the agenda of the production goal 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:06.910
 can enter at a younger age 

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:08.569
 according to the vice mayor 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:13.480
 supplementation involves many things such as being able to digest the forage and 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:17.640
 deported toÃ±o in such a way that supplementation that is if the mind 

00:02:17.639 --> 00:02:22.480
 face because it also implies a whole change in what is the organization and 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.579
 the operation of a stay 

00:02:24.579 --> 00:02:28.669
 He also explained that the types of supplementation vary according to the 

00:02:28.669 --> 00:02:33.209
 availability of pasture and production objectives I saw that you always have 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:37.150
 have to take into account some basic rules when supplementing the 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:38.009
 won 

00:02:38.009 --> 00:02:41.379
 normally if one does a supplementation has to start 

00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:43.490
 thinking about the subject already 

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:46.969
 before the end of this summer autumn start not 

00:02:46.969 --> 00:02:51.119
 with the objective for example of preserving fodder in reserve by which to 

00:02:51.119 --> 00:02:52.899
 when the critical time arrives 

00:02:52.899 --> 00:02:58.019
 and start with supplementation at the end this one in the fall may be the 

00:02:58.019 --> 00:02:59.479
 last month of autumn 

00:02:59.479 --> 00:03:03.769
 throughout the winter and if the first surgery is delayed even 

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:05.849
 until the first month 

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:07.619
 of spring 

00:03:07.619 --> 00:03:12.359
 and fundamentally the nutrients are good are the classical nutrients not 

00:03:12.359 --> 00:03:15.000
 protein energy minerals 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.619
 vitamins 

00:03:16.619 --> 00:03:21.359
 is what is most needed not because the pact is lacking in all this in this 

00:03:21.359 --> 00:03:24.159
 time 

00:03:24.159 --> 00:03:28.629
 if the supplementation is going to be more protein or energy energetic depends on 

00:03:28.629 --> 00:03:33.120
 how winter comes depends on the forage reserve with which one arrives the 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:36.009
 winter if there is good fodder reserve 

00:03:36.009 --> 00:03:41.679
 It has been a solidified mature forage with an energetic value and proteic 

00:03:41.679 --> 00:03:43.040
 relatively low 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:44.849
 you can take advantage 

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:47.289
 the digestibility this pasture 

00:03:47.289 --> 00:03:51.619
 and as a consequence of this consumption with a protein supplementation or with 

00:03:51.619 --> 00:03:54.009
 unasur with a multiple supplement 

00:03:54.009 --> 00:03:56.519
 known as protein salts not 

00:03:56.519 --> 00:04:01.639
 but if he continued with his face high and without a previous reservation of grass 

00:04:01.639 --> 00:04:04.949
 logically there is a problem of energy then supplementation 

00:04:04.949 --> 00:04:07.729
 should be more energetic in that case
