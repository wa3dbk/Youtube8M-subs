00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.020
 Hi guys, I'm good, I'm doing 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:07.230
 some videos today so I'll look like 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:09.570
 The same outfit with a lipstick is in some 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.070
 videos is if the first time you 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.200
 Are you watching my video I wanted? 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:16.830
 clarify that I'm not a professional 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:19.830
 and I do things my hair with 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:22.109
 experience is personal 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.449
 I do not do it in other people 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:27.689
 It's up to me and I risk it. 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:30.300
 I always think it is clear why 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:32.070
 I speak chemistry is something very serious is 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.719
 something you really have without looking 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:38.969
 a professional I with my account 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:41.969
 risk is since March 2013 is 1 year 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:42.870
 and 1 month 13 months that I neither use nor 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.760
 my hair 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.739
 my intention to stop using and baby 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.050
 It was because I wanted to change the color of my 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:50.879
 hair I wanted to do other chemistry 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.160
 Then I took advantage I became pregnant that the 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:55.739
 doctor did not release the use of enem and 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:59.550
 I took this time to stay without using 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:01.739
 he was and I entered the hair transition 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.780
 during the hair transition I used 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.880
 botox and the student who helped me a lot 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.790
 That saved my hair. 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:12.060
 my root during this transition and 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:15.509
 Last month I bought this product here 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:18.020
 what is the tense she sells da l'oreéal 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:20.700
 This one on the blue ball is for hair 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:24.689
 the trade is the cream 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:27.689
 smoothing is continuous and ammonia colatto 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:28.500
 This product is not compatible with 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:31.320
 he' 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:33.479
 if you have and do not use this product 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.970
 because your hair will melt and it will 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:38.220
 fall then so is not compatible with 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:45.509
 people are not compatible 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:50.299
 I paid and 53 and 90 53 and 90 and in my 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:50.299
 talisman before I paid 15 and 90 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:57.869
 the two have to be used together 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:02:00.840
 Can not use it separately then I 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:01.890
 bought more levinho is okay then 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.040
 come on 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:07.680
 is this product is a definite he has 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:11.009
 two ways of using it as relaxation with 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:14.280
 as definitive as smoothing I 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:17.069
 I used the final smoothing here or the 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:19.290
 which is the smoothing that will not come out with 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:22.709
 he washes it in my hair 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:24.660
 He is going to stay in my hair and that's it. 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:26.550
 that I was wanting I changed and chemistry 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:29.129
 I could have stayed with and could not even 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:30.000
 curiously definitive but I solved it 

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:32.400
 stay 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.230
 change chemistry because because it is in it 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:36.330
 is progressively failing to 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:38.430
 once I was having difficulty 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:41.190
 use the back of my root and 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:43.650
 everything else then I solved it really 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:45.330
 have a product that you 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:46.800
 first in my hair that 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:48.480
 I was not a tone for a while longer with 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:50.700
 Patience and waiting for my hair 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:53.099
 smoothed to it it is different from 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:54.930
 progressive because it is progressive it comes out 

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:57.330
 with the washes and this product he does not 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:59.360
 he leaves with the washes it 's fine he does not go out 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:02.250
 with the washes 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:03.330
 I did the mecha test done people. 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:05.550
 wick test 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:09.150
 I took a lock of my hair and I did 

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:11.760
 the way you say is as 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:15.300
 directions son of chen kaige the time and 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:17.370
 I was surprised that my hair like that 

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:19.409
 where I wanted to know where I had to 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:22.290
 do where the hair melts is where it does not 

00:03:19.409 --> 00:03:24.420
 there is more where he still has at the time 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:26.519
 where the TV channel is where you meet 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:28.799
 none did not melt in the hair did not 

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:32.489
 broke did not have anything i did not go there 

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:34.379
 nothing in the wick is i cut my hair right 

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:37.920
 I did not even tell you I cut my 

00:03:34.379 --> 00:03:39.299
 hair I cut I would cut more and more 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:42.659
 I wanted to do a test to see where 

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:44.340
 I was baby and I do not know the mother of my 

00:03:42.659 --> 00:03:46.890
 hair is with him I believe not 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:49.500
 be because he was with him ' 

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:51.780
 it would melt where the product touches 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:53.700
 Not so good night there 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:56.189
 waiting for her husband to arrive because 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:58.110
 product has to be done is that 

00:03:56.189 --> 00:04:00.510
 and if this chemistry has to be done with 

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:05.819
 slow caution I can not do 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:07.170
 rushing to do it slowly understood 

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:08.340
 so we have to be very careful 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:10.890
 in the awards 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:13.650
 arrive to be able to stay with my son I 

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:15.269
 I can do the procedure right then I 

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:18.359
 I did the procedure I did the procedure 

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:22.430
 so risks with a year manufacturer not 

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:24.990
 I changed nothing, I will have nothing people I did 

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:27.840
 right because she was full of fear but 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:30.150
 I only did in root I did not in my 

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:34.020
 hair is all new noncompliance I 

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:36.710
 I made it even further and then made it right and 

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:40.290
 everything went fine and I just stayed 

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:43.200
 delighted with the final result was 

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:45.030
 super bright was very happy in my 

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:46.710
 Hair I like my hair so I 

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:48.570
 I like my straight hair I do not like 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:50.310
 my hair with curls I do not like my 

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:52.860
 curly hair I like him so 

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:55.169
 the way I like my hair the 

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:57.900
 His name is very well then the 

00:04:55.169 --> 00:05:00.600
 I really loved it, I just came right here. 

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:02.639
 to share with you is for you 

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:05.910
 to know that I changed the fifth counted 

00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:07.740
 now using ammonium thioglycolate 

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:10.440
 automating neither point nor much 

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:13.320
 time you are 11 years old and tauane coconut 

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:16.590
 my hair has reacted very well to the extensive is 

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:18.060
 Of course before I do my hair 

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:21.539
 already hired I made a 

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:24.960
 reconstruction of my hair is this from here 

00:05:21.539 --> 00:05:27.870
 extreme of Italy and this reconstruction is 

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:29.580
 very good when you can when you go 

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:31.139
 do a chemistry before you do 

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:33.210
 a chemistry is good for you to make a 

00:05:31.139 --> 00:05:35.729
 reconstruction then the sesi under construction 

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:38.700
 so my hair is not cut 

00:05:35.729 --> 00:05:40.200
 chemist had no break had no fall 

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:42.840
 did not have any of this 

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:46.770
 my hair reacted very very well 

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:50.610
 even the tiger colatto of ammonia and I 

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:53.310
 I decided to buy this da l'oréal because 

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:55.500
 I researched a lot before 

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:58.200
 see that it is by indication of many 

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:59.400
 People are commanding capillary year 

00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:00.930
 this was the best 

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:02.070
 so that's why I bought because at 

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:04.950
 Sometimes we will buy a product 

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:06.870
 very cheap and if it hurts, you know 

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:09.690
 this chemistry business is 

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:11.930
 complicated and also people and is 

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:14.330
 a professional I did not look for myself and 

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:16.009
 If you do not, I'll do it. 

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:18.259
 in me and ready 

00:06:16.009 --> 00:06:19.610
 but so thank god it gave everything 

00:06:18.259 --> 00:06:21.020
 right right 

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:23.270
 but I will not tell you how it is 

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:25.220
 which was a step by step how and 

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:27.770
 that is done because it is a procedure that 

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:29.840
 it 's not easy to make it a little complicated 

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:32.300
 so I'd rather not tell you how 

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:34.850
 which makes it known whether in video that is 

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:37.160
 very complicated because sl leaves a 

00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:39.889
 difficult chemistry in a clinic 

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:42.380
 easy not then so I put my account 

00:06:39.889 --> 00:06:44.120
 It's risk and thank God it worked out, and my 

00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:46.940
 hair not fell is here for you 

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:49.340
 are with many neighbors without 

00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:52.789
 no curl no it's naturally 

00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:54.410
 cent we did not do anything in it no 

00:06:52.789 --> 00:06:57.289
 Clipboard did nothing 

00:06:54.410 --> 00:06:59.660
 I took the product out and let it dry 

00:06:57.289 --> 00:07:01.430
 naturally it is so very bright to 

00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:04.820
 Only thing I did was one there. 

00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:07.990
 you had a clamp 

00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:10.669
 same way that I like the way that I 

00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:13.490
 I like my hair then so this 

00:07:10.669 --> 00:07:16.250
 The time I spent eight years I spent 

00:07:13.490 --> 00:07:18.260
 with him it was cool, it was good, I loved it 

00:07:16.250 --> 00:07:20.210
 I would use and not imagine that I was 

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:22.400
 stop using and never in my life 

00:07:20.210 --> 00:07:25.159
 I imagined but it will not change because I 

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:29.030
 I want to change the color of my hair. 

00:07:25.159 --> 00:07:31.580
 now I do not expect that I will resist 

00:07:29.030 --> 00:07:33.740
 change now but so the coloring I go 

00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:36.590
 do in the hall heart does not have the courage 

00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:38.750
 to do at home is not to do in the hall 

00:07:36.590 --> 00:07:41.120
 What I want to do is something different. 

00:07:38.750 --> 00:07:44.240
 so I'm not going to make it at home today 

00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:46.310
 room to do what I think is there 

00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:48.380
 one for me more complicated I do not know 

00:07:46.310 --> 00:07:50.780
 mess with this girl know not to mess with 

00:07:48.380 --> 00:07:53.120
 these things so I prefer and in the hall 

00:07:50.780 --> 00:07:54.860
 in doing now is to put the faces of the 

00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:57.080
 treatments because it is also a 

00:07:54.860 --> 00:07:59.419
 heavy a family that damages are not 

00:07:57.080 --> 00:08:00.919
 Be careful so you have to continue. 

00:07:59.419 --> 00:08:03.169
 with my care whenever it is 

00:08:00.919 --> 00:08:05.389
 It's impossible that my hair is then 

00:08:03.169 --> 00:08:09.520
 this a kiss for you, hold on to 

00:08:05.389 --> 00:08:09.520
 God, until the next video, bye-bye
