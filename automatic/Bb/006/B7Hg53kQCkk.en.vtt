00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:31.510 
some less misunderstood is that if you

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:33.720 
some less misunderstood is that if you

00:00:38.589 --> 00:00:40.439 
is competent and usable on the streets
and<00:00:38.769> probably<00:00:39.399> better<00:00:39.640> than<00:00:39.819> a<00:00:39.940> lot<00:00:40.059> of<00:00:40.120> street

00:00:40.439 --> 00:00:40.449 
and probably better than a lot of street

00:00:40.449 --> 00:00:42.209 
and probably better than a lot of street
fighters<00:00:40.870> one<00:00:41.079> because<00:00:41.440> your<00:00:41.589> training<00:00:42.039> it's

00:00:42.209 --> 00:00:42.219

a<00:00:42.370> there's<00:00:42.940> a<00:00:42.999> whole<00:00:43.179> lot<00:00:43.390> of<00:00:43.420> things<00:00:43.569> that<00:00:43.809> go

00:00:43.919 --> 00:00:43.929 
a there's a whole lot of things that go

00:00:43.929 --> 00:00:46.799 
a there's a whole lot of things that go
into<00:00:44.230> fighting<00:00:44.499> besides<00:00:45.039> just<00:00:45.429> drills<00:00:46.269> and<00:00:46.659> I

00:00:46.799 --> 00:00:46.809 
into fighting besides just drills and I

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:49.110 
into fighting besides just drills and I
think<00:00:47.109> this<00:00:47.260> is<00:00:47.319> where<00:00:47.649> like<00:00:47.949> the<00:00:48.399> wind<00:00:48.640> tunnel

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:49.120 
think this is where like the wind tunnel

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:51.479 
think this is where like the wind tunnel
even<00:00:49.420> any<00:00:49.870> other<00:00:50.140> seismic<00:00:50.710> charge<00:00:50.979> by<00:00:51.190> white

00:00:51.479 --> 00:00:51.489 
even any other seismic charge by white

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:55.709 
even any other seismic charge by white
men<00:00:52.229> other<00:00:53.229> come<00:00:53.620> food<00:00:54.420> styles<00:00:55.420> of<00:00:55.539> martial

art styles of science boxing boxing

00:00:59.429 --> 00:01:02.489 
art styles of science boxing boxing
overrides<00:01:00.429> them<00:01:00.819> because<00:01:01.269> boxers<00:01:01.870> in<00:01:02.260> each

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:02.499 
overrides them because boxers in each

00:01:02.499 --> 00:01:05.190 
overrides them because boxers in each
other<00:01:02.769> and<00:01:03.219> work<00:01:03.549> with<00:01:03.850> things<00:01:04.600> that<00:01:04.809> happen
