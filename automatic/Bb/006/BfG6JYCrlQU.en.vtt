 it will not be offended 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:40.110
 let's break this page into 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.270
 individual modules and blocks 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.260
 the first stage on top will be a cap 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:46.710
 headline 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:47.980
 will go on 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:50.450
 second menu module 

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:53.140
 below is under quotes yet 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:53.750
 one 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:56.750
 so even lower 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.950
 pages divided into two parts 

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:01.500
 left pictures 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.100
 on right 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:06.100
 let's look even lower 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.050
 flat block with text 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:14.050
 the main block of the site further 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.110
 stand out in the blog where we will form 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:20.060
 subscription stand 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:21.880
 below 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:25.120
 5 text module again subscription form 

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:27.890
 based on a table of text blocks with 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:29.300
 coordinates by 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:32.000
 thus conditionally structure the future 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.400
 site can be represented like this 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:36.210
 here are rectangles 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.460
 upper neck cap headings 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:39.770
 the photo 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:41.960
 text where it will be located in 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:42.800
 registration form 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:44.790
 registration forms and t 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.530
 it is more rectangular zone 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.760
 plain text will be located 

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:50.960
 well all the structures got let's 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:52.390
 let's get started 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:54.800
 as the frame of our future site 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:56.439
 let's countries table 

00:01:56.439 --> 00:01:59.140
 in the table we will be two columns sofia 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:00.480
 9 lines 

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:03.480
 framing let's remove 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:06.380
 hockey 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:09.539
 the table is created do not be confused to survive 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:12.769
 black non printed character 

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:14.469
 I used to take off work and not just 

00:02:14.469 --> 00:02:17.439
 shows blank lines when 

00:02:17.439 --> 00:02:18.989
 you can disable them in 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:20.549
 the final form of them 

00:02:20.549 --> 00:02:22.029
 will be unnoticed 

00:02:22.029 --> 00:02:23.629
 tables ready 

00:02:23.629 --> 00:02:26.629
 we will set the main properties 

00:02:27.479 --> 00:02:30.189
 for the whole table 

00:02:30.189 --> 00:02:32.099
 centered it must be selected 

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:34.949
 let's take wider but equal 

00:02:34.949 --> 00:02:37.139
 17 7 meters 

00:02:37.139 --> 00:02:40.289
 so further on the tab framing 

00:02:40.289 --> 00:02:42.059
 choose 

00:02:42.059 --> 00:02:43.969
 only external frame 

00:02:43.969 --> 00:02:45.750
 framing thickness 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:47.969
 0 5 

00:02:47.969 --> 00:02:50.109
 tab in 

00:02:50.109 --> 00:02:53.389
 let's set the color for the table 

00:02:53.389 --> 00:02:55.199
 we type the table 

00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:57.080
 and select lyrics 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:58.969
 anything low-key 

00:02:58.969 --> 00:03:01.609
 We confirm the button 

00:03:01.609 --> 00:03:02.890
 let's ask 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:06.019
 background color 

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:09.019
 whole page 

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:11.709
 we would be here 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:14.709
 move on site 

00:03:16.289 --> 00:03:18.609
 copy the chick header 

00:03:18.609 --> 00:03:21.179
 contour auctions copy 

00:03:21.179 --> 00:03:24.079
 come to our layouts and here 

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:25.769
 is necessary 

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:27.849
 insert the top 

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:30.179
 combine the cells in one 

00:03:30.179 --> 00:03:32.339
 and execute the command 

00:03:32.339 --> 00:03:33.359
 rate 

00:03:33.359 --> 00:03:36.989
 and in the pack as text without formatting 

00:03:38.049 --> 00:03:41.099
 we take the extra space we set the nobility 

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:42.749
 necessary elements 

00:03:42.749 --> 00:03:45.579
 let's make a drove taken into account 

00:03:45.579 --> 00:03:47.919
 Washington 

00:03:47.919 --> 00:03:50.239
 height from predecessors 

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:51.399
 centered 

00:03:51.399 --> 00:03:54.859
 that y sewn was similar to the one in which 

00:03:54.859 --> 00:03:55.900
 bulygin 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:57.630
 original site highlighted 

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:01.440
 Headset Jordan Key slightly embellished 

00:04:02.869 --> 00:04:06.009
 but 

00:04:06.009 --> 00:04:09.009
 we will eliminate among scrap 

00:04:09.629 --> 00:04:12.729
 Muftiyat not that and so it seems 

00:04:12.729 --> 00:04:15.729
 let us also to the light of the claim 

00:04:17.599 --> 00:04:19.849
 we will do the usual 

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:22.099
 tall 

00:04:22.099 --> 00:04:25.090
 13 

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:26.840
 headset 

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:28.639
 early verdict 

00:04:28.639 --> 00:04:30.610
 the canvas we have is there 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:31.479
 text 

00:04:31.479 --> 00:04:34.659
 let's rush a little 

00:04:34.659 --> 00:04:36.160
 for this we choose 

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:39.160
 and paragraph and after paragraph give 

00:04:39.889 --> 00:04:41.759
 two millimeters ikao 

00:04:41.759 --> 00:04:43.270
 interval 

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:45.830
 so let's see what we have next farther 

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:48.449
 we have a menu bar 

00:04:48.449 --> 00:04:51.270
 line me here two main points 

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:54.520
 page there was a page for me 

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:57.569
 if we consider that we have this page and 

00:04:57.569 --> 00:05:00.229
 glorious will probably be enough 

00:05:00.229 --> 00:05:01.849
 just one point 

00:05:01.849 --> 00:05:04.559
 Obama is not 

00:05:04.559 --> 00:05:07.460
 do this those reached the mailing list for this 

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:08.660

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:11.660
 click the hyperlink button 

00:05:13.599 --> 00:05:16.710
 for educational purposes, I put 

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:19.770
 link to your site 

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:22.490

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:24.960
 form to new page 

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:26.319
 opened a new window 

00:05:26.319 --> 00:05:29.319
 click to apply some close 

00:05:30.089 --> 00:05:31.520
 it's clear that 

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:33.490
 the text has become a hyperlink 

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:35.439
 let's denote 

00:05:35.439 --> 00:05:38.439
 the string as we had in the original 

00:05:39.659 --> 00:05:42.400
 select colors 

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:45.400

00:05:45.999 --> 00:05:47.319
 we choose 

00:05:47.319 --> 00:05:49.889
 line 

00:05:49.889 --> 00:05:52.169
 what color but any 

00:05:52.169 --> 00:05:54.059
 either caught the eye 

00:05:54.059 --> 00:05:56.199
 in the future, the couple can each choose 

00:05:56.199 --> 00:05:58.759
 such what he likes and my task 

00:05:58.759 --> 00:06:02.009
 show how this is done in principle 

00:06:02.009 --> 00:06:05.009
 so go to the site 

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:10.219
