not long ago I think it's the best
rmz450<00:00:30.189> that<00:00:30.520> that<00:00:30.789> I've<00:00:30.880> ridden<00:00:31.150> it's

rmz450 that that I've ridden it's

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:33.229 
rmz450 that that I've ridden it's
definitely<00:00:31.779> the<00:00:31.869> best<00:00:31.990> one<00:00:32.140> out<00:00:32.169> of<00:00:32.320> the<00:00:32.439> box

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
definitely the best one out of the box

definitely the best one out of the box
you<00:00:34.239> know<00:00:34.360> they've<00:00:34.690> made<00:00:35.410> a<00:00:35.440> lot<00:00:35.680> of<00:00:35.710> little

changes with this bike but all together

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:39.479 
changes with this bike but all together
it's<00:00:38.140> added<00:00:38.350> up<00:00:38.470> to<00:00:38.650> some<00:00:38.830> some<00:00:39.250> pretty

00:00:39.479 --> 00:00:39.489

it's added up to some some pretty
drastic<00:00:39.699> improvements<00:00:40.479> and<00:00:40.659> and<00:00:40.949> I'm

00:00:41.939 --> 00:00:41.949 
drastic improvements and and I'm

00:00:41.949 --> 00:00:43.619

things that you can try with the bikes
suspension<00:01:15.850> wise<00:01:16.000> that<00:01:16.570> one<00:01:16.930> of<00:01:17.079> the<00:01:17.140> main

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:17.350 
suspension wise that one of the main

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:18.870 
suspension wise that one of the main
things<00:01:17.590> I've<00:01:17.740> done<00:01:17.770> so<00:01:18.159> far<00:01:18.189> this<00:01:18.460> morning<00:01:18.640> is

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:18.880 
things I've done so far this morning is

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:21.029 
things I've done so far this morning is
just<00:01:18.909> play<00:01:19.240> around<00:01:19.299> with<00:01:19.630> suspension<00:01:20.200> with

00:01:21.029 --> 00:01:21.039 
just play around with suspension with

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:23.520 
just play around with suspension with
the<00:01:21.159> different<00:01:21.490> sff<00:01:22.030> fork<00:01:22.719> allows<00:01:23.140> you<00:01:23.350> with

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:23.530 
the different sff fork allows you with

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:25.289 
the different sff fork allows you with
spring<00:01:23.770> preload<00:01:23.950> so<00:01:24.280> I've<00:01:24.490> done<00:01:24.909> quite<00:01:24.969> a<00:01:25.210> bit

00:01:25.289 --> 00:01:25.299 
spring preload so I've done quite a bit

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:27.240 
spring preload so I've done quite a bit
of<00:01:25.420> work<00:01:25.659> with<00:01:25.840> that<00:01:25.990> just<00:01:26.259> to<00:01:26.439> find<00:01:27.039> the

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:27.250 
of work with that just to find the

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:28.800 
of work with that just to find the
different<00:01:27.549> settings<00:01:27.880> and<00:01:28.030> see<00:01:28.479> what<00:01:28.630> they

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:28.810 
different settings and see what they

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:30.749 
different settings and see what they
what<00:01:29.409> they<00:01:29.439> do<00:01:29.619> it's<00:01:30.189> great<00:01:30.369> having<00:01:30.549> that

00:01:30.749 --> 00:01:30.759 
what they do it's great having that

00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:32.940 
what they do it's great having that
adjustability<00:01:31.600> on<00:01:31.840> a<00:01:32.229> standard<00:01:32.679> motorcycle

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:32.950 
adjustability on a standard motorcycle

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:36.389 
adjustability on a standard motorcycle
and<00:01:33.399> probably<00:01:34.299> one<00:01:34.450> of<00:01:34.509> the<00:01:34.689> key<00:01:35.140> benefits<00:01:35.399> so

00:01:36.389 --> 00:01:36.399 
and probably one of the key benefits so

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:39.029 
and probably one of the key benefits so
far<00:01:36.640> that<00:01:36.999> I<00:01:37.090> found<00:01:37.359> look<00:01:38.229> for<00:01:38.439> fifty<00:01:38.740> engines

00:01:39.029 --> 00:01:39.039 
far that I found look for fifty engines

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:40.739 
far that I found look for fifty engines
are<00:01:39.159> all<00:01:39.280> you<00:01:39.880> know<00:01:39.909> they<00:01:40.240> could<00:01:40.390> nearly<00:01:40.539> come

00:01:40.739 --> 00:01:40.749 
are all you know they could nearly come

00:01:40.749 --> 00:01:41.940 
are all you know they could nearly come
out<00:01:40.899> of<00:01:40.990> the<00:01:41.049> same<00:01:41.200> factory<00:01:41.590> and<00:01:41.679> it<00:01:41.740> wouldn't

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:41.950 
out of the same factory and it wouldn't

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:43.219 
out of the same factory and it wouldn't
you<00:01:42.159> wouldn't<00:01:42.310> really<00:01:42.460> pick<00:01:42.729> them<00:01:42.850> these<00:01:42.969> days

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
you wouldn't really pick them these days

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:46.830 
you wouldn't really pick them these days
very<00:01:44.229> tractable<00:01:45.090> it's<00:01:46.090> nice<00:01:46.390> that<00:01:46.420> they've

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:46.840 
very tractable it's nice that they've

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:48.389 
very tractable it's nice that they've
got<00:01:46.990> the<00:01:47.109> coupler<00:01:47.439> system<00:01:47.799> now<00:01:47.950> that<00:01:48.159> gives

00:01:48.389 --> 00:01:48.399 
got the coupler system now that gives

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:50.520 
got the coupler system now that gives
you<00:01:48.490> the<00:01:48.549> options<00:01:48.969> of<00:01:49.119> a<00:01:49.240> rich<00:01:49.960> setting<00:01:50.409> which

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:50.530 
you the options of a rich setting which

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:52.559 
you the options of a rich setting which
makes<00:01:50.770> it<00:01:50.890> a<00:01:50.979> little<00:01:51.130> bit<00:01:51.280> flatter<00:01:51.579> through<00:01:52.390> to

00:01:52.559 --> 00:01:52.569 
makes it a little bit flatter through to

00:01:52.569 --> 00:01:53.880 
makes it a little bit flatter through to
the<00:01:52.689> standard<00:01:53.079> setting<00:01:53.350> and<00:01:53.469> then<00:01:53.590> and<00:01:53.770> then

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:53.890 
the standard setting and then and then

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:55.200 
the standard setting and then and then
have<00:01:54.009> also<00:01:54.249> got<00:01:54.399> a<00:01:54.429> lean<00:01:54.640> a<00:01:54.670> couple<00:01:55.030> of<00:01:55.090> which

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:55.210 
have also got a lean a couple of which

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:56.880 
have also got a lean a couple of which
which<00:01:55.780> definitely<00:01:56.140> gives<00:01:56.409> it<00:01:56.499> a<00:01:56.560> fair<00:01:56.770> bit

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:56.890 
which definitely gives it a fair bit

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:58.200 
which definitely gives it a fair bit
more<00:01:57.130> punch<00:01:57.340> off<00:01:57.579> the<00:01:57.609> bottom<00:01:57.969> and<00:01:58.060> in<00:01:58.149> the

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:58.210 
more punch off the bottom and in the

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:01.469 
more punch off the bottom and in the
mid-range<00:01:59.340> look<00:02:00.340> I<00:02:00.490> ended<00:02:00.759> up<00:02:00.819> I<00:02:01.060> really<00:02:01.359> like

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:01.479 
mid-range look I ended up I really like

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:03.450 
mid-range look I ended up I really like
the<00:02:01.659> standard<00:02:02.109> as<00:02:02.499> an<00:02:02.710> overall<00:02:03.069> couple

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:03.460 
the standard as an overall couple

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:05.580 
the standard as an overall couple
because<00:02:03.729> it<00:02:03.850> just<00:02:03.969> gives<00:02:04.240> you<00:02:04.389> it's<00:02:05.259> just<00:02:05.530> a

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:05.590 
because it just gives you it's just a

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:07.830 
because it just gives you it's just a
really<00:02:05.799> nice<00:02:06.100> broad<00:02:06.460> spread<00:02:06.700> of<00:02:06.880> power<00:02:07.090> this

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:07.840 
really nice broad spread of power this

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:09.690 
really nice broad spread of power this

been an issue for this blog has always
produced<00:02:11.230> good<00:02:11.620> horsepower<00:02:11.890> it<00:02:12.250> feels<00:02:12.880> a

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
produced good horsepower it feels a

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:14.520 
produced good horsepower it feels a
little<00:02:13.420> bit<00:02:13.599> smoother<00:02:13.989> this<00:02:14.140> year<00:02:14.379> and

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.530 
little bit smoother this year and

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:17.640 
little bit smoother this year and
definitely<00:02:14.830> it<00:02:15.569> tracks<00:02:16.569> well<00:02:16.840> it<00:02:17.110> comes<00:02:17.470> off

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.650 
definitely it tracks well it comes off

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:18.540 
definitely it tracks well it comes off
the<00:02:17.799> corners<00:02:18.190> really

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:18.550 
the corners really

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:21.660 
the corners really
well<00:02:18.930> and<00:02:19.930> and<00:02:20.230> look<00:02:20.380> it<00:02:20.560> still<00:02:20.680> it<00:02:21.130> still<00:02:21.460> revs

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:21.670 
well and and look it still it still revs

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:23.220 
well and and look it still it still revs
out<00:02:21.850> and<00:02:22.030> produces<00:02:22.450> horsetail<00:02:22.810> quite<00:02:23.050> high<00:02:23.200> up

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.230 
out and produces horsetail quite high up

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:24.990 
out and produces horsetail quite high up
as<00:02:23.500> well<00:02:23.680> so<00:02:23.830> overall<00:02:24.220> I<00:02:24.250> think<00:02:24.370> it's<00:02:24.820> a<00:02:24.910> great

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000 
as well so overall I think it's a great

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.050 
as well so overall I think it's a great
engine<00:02:25.390> yeah<00:02:26.230> look<00:02:26.470> I<00:02:26.500> think<00:02:27.250> retail<00:02:27.550> we<00:02:27.790> found

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
engine yeah look I think retail we found

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:31.890 
engine yeah look I think retail we found
last<00:02:28.240> night<00:02:28.390> was<00:02:28.600> 11<00:02:28.930> 790<00:02:29.550> I'm<00:02:30.600> top<00:02:31.600> me<00:02:31.750> head

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 
last night was 11 790 I'm top me head

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:33.000 
last night was 11 790 I'm top me head
can't<00:02:32.110> tell<00:02:32.260> you<00:02:32.320> what<00:02:32.440> all<00:02:32.560> the<00:02:32.650> other<00:02:32.680> ones

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.010 
can't tell you what all the other ones

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:36.510 
can't tell you what all the other ones
are<00:02:33.190> I<00:02:33.400> think<00:02:33.880> they're<00:02:34.030> all<00:02:34.150> about<00:02:34.810> that<00:02:35.520> and

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:36.520 
are I think they're all about that and

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:38.460 
are I think they're all about that and
look<00:02:36.820> it's<00:02:36.970> you<00:02:37.480> know<00:02:37.570> I<00:02:37.780> think<00:02:38.200> it's

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.470 
look it's you know I think it's

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:39.840 
look it's you know I think it's
competitive<00:02:38.980> and<00:02:39.130> I<00:02:39.190> think<00:02:39.460> that<00:02:39.610> that

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:39.850 
competitive and I think that that

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:43.050 
competitive and I think that that
they've<00:02:40.450> done<00:02:40.660> a<00:02:40.690> good<00:02:40.930> job<00:02:40.990> in<00:02:41.790> making<00:02:42.790> some

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.060 
they've done a good job in making some

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:45.660 
they've done a good job in making some
changes<00:02:43.270> that<00:02:43.510> were<00:02:44.230> probably<00:02:44.530> going<00:02:45.370> to<00:02:45.490> help

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:45.670 
changes that were probably going to help

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:48.390 
changes that were probably going to help
it<00:02:46.140> it<00:02:47.140> already<00:02:47.410> gets<00:02:47.650> good<00:02:47.830> results<00:02:48.220> on<00:02:48.310> the

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:48.400 
it it already gets good results on the

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.250 
it it already gets good results on the
racetrack<00:02:48.580> but<00:02:48.820> I<00:02:49.150> think<00:02:49.540> that<00:02:49.720> for<00:02:50.200> the

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:50.260 
racetrack but I think that for the

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.590 
racetrack but I think that for the
general<00:02:50.740> punter<00:02:51.100> I<00:02:51.280> think<00:02:51.760> it's<00:02:52.060> the<00:02:52.150> best<00:02:52.420> one

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:52.600 
general punter I think it's the best one

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:55.170 
general punter I think it's the best one
that<00:02:52.630> I've<00:02:53.170> written<00:02:53.350> for<00:02:53.560> sure<00:02:53.850> yeah<00:02:54.850> look<00:02:55.030> I<00:02:55.150> I

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.180 
that I've written for sure yeah look I I

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:57.600 
that I've written for sure yeah look I I
have<00:02:55.810> not<00:02:56.050> touched<00:02:56.380> the<00:02:56.620> rear<00:02:56.770> suspension<00:02:57.340> all

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:57.610 
have not touched the rear suspension all

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:59.190 
have not touched the rear suspension all
morning<00:02:58.030> I've<00:02:58.270> played<00:02:58.600> around<00:02:58.780> quite<00:02:59.050> a<00:02:59.080> lot

00:02:59.190 --> 00:02:59.200 
morning I've played around quite a lot

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:00.570 
morning I've played around quite a lot
with<00:02:59.410> the<00:02:59.500> front<00:02:59.710> because<00:02:59.980> the<00:03:00.130> front<00:03:00.340> is<00:03:00.400> very

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:00.580 
with the front because the front is very

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:02.880 
with the front because the front is very
easy<00:03:00.790> to<00:03:00.940> change<00:03:01.210> we're<00:03:02.110> basically<00:03:02.260> just<00:03:02.590> set

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:02.890 
easy to change we're basically just set

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:04.200 
easy to change we're basically just set
with<00:03:02.980> joy<00:03:03.220> and<00:03:03.280> the<00:03:03.430> boys<00:03:03.580> we<00:03:03.790> just<00:03:03.970> set<00:03:04.090> the
