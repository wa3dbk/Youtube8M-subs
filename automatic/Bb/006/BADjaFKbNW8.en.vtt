00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
I'm going to glue all these parts

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.170 
I'm going to glue all these parts
together<00:02:42.600> so<00:02:42.990> that<00:02:43.740> it's<00:02:44.250> solid<00:02:44.760> and<00:02:45.030> it

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
together so that it's solid and it

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.150 
together so that it's solid and it
doesn't<00:02:45.510> leak<00:02:46.050> or<00:02:46.350> stink<00:02:46.680> or<00:02:46.800> anything<00:02:46.950> like

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
doesn't leak or stink or anything like

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:49.430 
doesn't leak or stink or anything like
that<00:02:47.270> then<00:02:48.270> I'm<00:02:48.390> going<00:02:48.510> to<00:02:48.570> cut<00:02:49.050> this<00:02:49.200> pipe<00:02:49.380> to

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
that then I'm going to cut this pipe to

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:52.130 
that then I'm going to cut this pipe to
size<00:02:49.830> glue<00:02:50.340> it<00:02:50.459> on<00:02:50.550> to<00:02:50.730> this<00:02:50.880> then<00:02:51.750> set<00:02:51.990> the

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
size glue it on to this then set the

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:55.310 
size glue it on to this then set the
sink<00:02:53.150> we<00:02:54.150> don't<00:02:54.330> want<00:02:54.450> any<00:02:54.600> leak<00:02:54.840> or<00:02:55.020> stink

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:55.320 
sink we don't want any leak or stink

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:58.160 
sink we don't want any leak or stink
that's<00:02:55.860> right<00:02:56.209> so<00:02:57.209> here's<00:02:57.420> the<00:02:57.600> laundry<00:02:57.959> room

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
that's right so here's the laundry room

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:02.320 
that's right so here's the laundry room
and<00:02:58.580> we<00:02:59.580> decided<00:02:59.970> to<00:03:00.120> get<00:03:00.360> this<00:03:00.690> vent<00:03:01.110> thing

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:02.330 
and we decided to get this vent thing

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:05.870 
and we decided to get this vent thing
this<00:03:03.330> is<00:03:03.510> a<00:03:03.540> lint<00:03:03.840> trap<00:03:04.170> kit<00:03:04.560> it's<00:03:05.250> ideal<00:03:05.610> for

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:05.880 
this is a lint trap kit it's ideal for

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:07.970 
this is a lint trap kit it's ideal for
use<00:03:06.030> where<00:03:06.330> outside<00:03:06.750> venting<00:03:07.230> is<00:03:07.320> impossible

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 
use where outside venting is impossible

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:13.430 
use where outside venting is impossible
the<00:03:09.110> dryer<00:03:10.110> vent<00:03:10.880> goes<00:03:11.880> out<00:03:12.060> here<00:03:12.420> into<00:03:13.320> this

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440 
the dryer vent goes out here into this

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:14.780 
the dryer vent goes out here into this
thing<00:03:13.739> that's<00:03:13.950> filled<00:03:14.250> with<00:03:14.370> an<00:03:14.459> inch<00:03:14.640> of

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790 
thing that's filled with an inch of

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:16.940 
thing that's filled with an inch of
water<00:03:15.000> and<00:03:15.720> then<00:03:16.140> there's<00:03:16.440> a<00:03:16.500> little<00:03:16.650> bit<00:03:16.769> of

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:16.950 
water and then there's a little bit of

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:19.610 
water and then there's a little bit of
vent<00:03:17.130> that<00:03:17.280> comes<00:03:17.459> out<00:03:17.610> here<00:03:17.959> so<00:03:18.959> there<00:03:19.470> is

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620 
vent that comes out here so there is

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:22.670 
vent that comes out here so there is
lint<00:03:19.980> everywhere<00:03:20.550> it<00:03:21.150> feels<00:03:22.019> like<00:03:22.350> a<00:03:22.380> wet

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 
lint everywhere it feels like a wet

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:23.690 
lint everywhere it feels like a wet
sauna<00:03:23.040> in<00:03:23.340> here

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:23.700 
sauna in here

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:28.370 
sauna in here
this<00:03:24.570> thing<00:03:24.870> sucks<00:03:26.660> ultimately<00:03:27.660> we<00:03:28.019> vented

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:28.380 
this thing sucks ultimately we vented

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:37.000 
this thing sucks ultimately we vented
the<00:03:28.470> dryer<00:03:28.709> outside

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:37.010 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:04:16.500 

you

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:16.510 

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:18.570
