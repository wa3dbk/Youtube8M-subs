00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:19.170 
actually I got on ebay and craigslist
and<00:01:13.630> Amazon<00:01:14.490> so<00:01:16.290> the<00:01:17.290> the<00:01:18.130> monitor<00:01:18.549> arms<00:01:18.940> i

and Amazon so the the monitor arms i

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:21.870 
and Amazon so the the monitor arms i
actually<00:01:19.840> purchased<00:01:20.229> on<00:01:20.620> craigslist<00:01:21.310> this

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:21.880 
actually purchased on craigslist this

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:25.080 
actually purchased on craigslist this
one<00:01:22.120> I<00:01:22.150> already<00:01:22.450> owned<00:01:22.890> these<00:01:23.890> are<00:01:24.130> the<00:01:24.220> m7<00:01:24.970> by

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:25.090 
one I already owned these are the m7 by

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:28.290 
one I already owned these are the m7 by
human<00:01:25.480> scale<00:01:25.810> and<00:01:26.020> I<00:01:26.800> like<00:01:27.760> them<00:01:27.970> so<00:01:28.240> much

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:28.300 
human scale and I like them so much

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:30.450 
human scale and I like them so much
better<00:01:28.690> than<00:01:28.900> a<00:01:29.080> hydraulic<00:01:29.650> systems<00:01:30.100> because

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:30.460 
better than a hydraulic systems because

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:34.830 
better than a hydraulic systems because
the<00:01:30.580> hydraulic<00:01:31.120> systems<00:01:32.670> tend<00:01:33.670> to<00:01:33.940> sag<00:01:34.480> or

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:34.840 
the hydraulic systems tend to sag or

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:38.340 
the hydraulic systems tend to sag or
move<00:01:35.410> over<00:01:35.860> time<00:01:36.100> so<00:01:37.060> these<00:01:37.450> ones<00:01:37.750> are<00:01:37.900> rigid

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:38.350 
move over time so these ones are rigid

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:42.000 
move over time so these ones are rigid
and<00:01:38.550> they<00:01:39.930> their<00:01:40.930> rigidity<00:01:41.470> works<00:01:41.680> really

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:42.010 
and they their rigidity works really

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:45.240 
and they their rigidity works really
well<00:01:42.130> for<00:01:42.400> me<00:01:42.700> they<00:01:43.450> don't<00:01:43.570> they<00:01:43.990> don't<00:01:44.250> sag

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:45.250 
well for me they don't they don't sag

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:48.960 
well for me they don't they don't sag
and<00:01:45.610> they<00:01:46.330> just<00:01:46.510> pivot<00:01:47.080> very<00:01:47.290> nicely<00:01:47.530> arm<00:01:48.370> this

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:48.970 
and they just pivot very nicely arm this

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:52.530 
and they just pivot very nicely arm this
used<00:01:49.180> to<00:01:49.300> hold<00:01:49.510> my<00:01:49.720> apple<00:01:50.560> monitor<00:01:50.770> and<00:01:51.190> now<00:01:51.540> by

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:52.540 
used to hold my apple monitor and now by

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:56.940 
used to hold my apple monitor and now by
buying<00:01:53.700> an<00:01:54.700> attachment<00:01:55.150> kit<00:01:55.720> for<00:01:56.470> the<00:01:56.500> plate

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:56.950 
buying an attachment kit for the plate

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:02.340 
buying an attachment kit for the plate
and<00:01:59.520> also<00:02:00.520> an<00:02:00.820> attachment<00:02:01.180> for<00:02:01.780> the<00:02:01.870> laptop

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:02.350 
and also an attachment for the laptop

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:06.930 
and also an attachment for the laptop
which<00:02:03.310> probably<00:02:03.790> cost<00:02:04.150> me<00:02:04.330> about<00:02:04.650> $35<00:02:05.850> for<00:02:06.850> the

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:06.940 
which probably cost me about $35 for the

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:09.449 
which probably cost me about $35 for the
arm<00:02:07.300> and<00:02:07.750> in<00:02:07.870> about<00:02:08.080> twelve<00:02:08.739> dollars<00:02:09.190> so<00:02:09.369> it

00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:09.459 
arm and in about twelve dollars so it

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:10.830 
arm and in about twelve dollars so it
was<00:02:09.580> like<00:02:09.670> around<00:02:09.849> 40<00:02:10.330> something<00:02:10.659> dollars

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:10.840 
was like around 40 something dollars

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:13.559 
was like around 40 something dollars
just<00:02:11.709> to<00:02:11.830> convert<00:02:12.220> this<00:02:12.370> arm<00:02:12.730> but<00:02:13.300> I<00:02:13.330> got<00:02:13.540> to

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:13.569 
just to convert this arm but I got to

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:50.620 
so I can work on this I can work on that

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:52.559 
so I can work on this I can work on that
boot<00:03:50.950> plywood's<00:03:51.430> only<00:03:51.670> three-quarters<00:03:52.180> of<00:03:52.359> an

00:03:52.559 --> 00:03:52.569 
boot plywood's only three-quarters of an

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:54.750 
boot plywood's only three-quarters of an
inch<00:03:52.719> so<00:03:53.590> I<00:03:53.620> laminated<00:03:54.280> the<00:03:54.370> two<00:03:54.519> pieces

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:54.760 
inch so I laminated the two pieces

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:57.330 
inch so I laminated the two pieces
together<00:03:55.140> to<00:03:56.140> get<00:03:56.290> the<00:03:56.469> full<00:03:56.709> edge<00:03:56.980> detail

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:57.340 
together to get the full edge detail

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:59.899 
together to get the full edge detail
that<00:03:57.790> I<00:03:57.819> wanted<00:03:58.269> and<00:03:58.450> also<00:03:58.930> some<00:03:59.140> rigidity

00:03:59.899 --> 00:03:59.909 
that I wanted and also some rigidity

00:03:59.909 --> 00:04:01.949 
that I wanted and also some rigidity
since<00:04:00.909> it<00:04:01.060> was<00:04:01.180> going<00:04:01.329> to<00:04:01.390> hold<00:04:01.569> so<00:04:01.810> much

00:04:01.949 --> 00:04:01.959 
since it was going to hold so much

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:06.240 
since it was going to hold so much
weight<00:04:02.290> and<00:04:02.700> on<00:04:03.700> the<00:04:03.849> sides<00:04:04.120> I<00:04:04.859> had<00:04:05.859> a<00:04:05.890> piece

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:06.250 
weight and on the sides I had a piece

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:11.280 
weight and on the sides I had a piece
cut<00:04:06.579> left<00:04:06.849> over<00:04:07.269> that<00:04:07.930> was<00:04:08.230> a<00:04:09.750> two<00:04:10.750> feet<00:04:11.049> by

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:11.290 
cut left over that was a two feet by

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:14.429 
cut left over that was a two feet by
four<00:04:11.709> feet<00:04:11.739> and<00:04:12.359> I<00:04:13.359> created<00:04:13.810> these<00:04:14.049> shelves

00:04:14.429 --> 00:04:14.439 
four feet and I created these shelves

00:04:14.439 --> 00:04:19.199 
four feet and I created these shelves
that<00:04:15.370> emulate<00:04:16.000> the<00:04:16.209> radius<00:04:17.609> so<00:04:18.609> these<00:04:18.820> little

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:19.209 
that emulate the radius so these little

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:23.249 
that emulate the radius so these little
tubs<00:04:19.630> are<00:04:19.930> our<00:04:20.590> kind<00:04:21.160> of<00:04:21.310> like<00:04:21.489> my<00:04:22.020> idea<00:04:23.020> of

00:04:23.249 --> 00:04:23.259 
tubs are our kind of like my idea of

00:04:23.259 --> 00:04:26.760 
tubs are our kind of like my idea of
replacing<00:04:23.560> drawers<00:04:24.690> so<00:04:25.690> the<00:04:25.930> little<00:04:26.080> tubs<00:04:26.470> get

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:26.770 
replacing drawers so the little tubs get

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:28.560 
replacing drawers so the little tubs get
each<00:04:26.979> things<00:04:27.430> in<00:04:27.610> categories<00:04:28.300> and<00:04:28.479> then

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:28.570 
each things in categories and then

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:30.270 
each things in categories and then
stacked<00:04:28.930> on<00:04:29.139> the<00:04:29.259> side<00:04:29.470> so<00:04:29.800> when<00:04:29.979> I<00:04:30.009> need<00:04:30.250> them

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:30.280 
stacked on the side so when I need them

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:32.430 
stacked on the side so when I need them
they're<00:04:30.580> there<00:04:30.820> and<00:04:31.060> of<00:04:31.840> course<00:04:32.080> the<00:04:32.259> whole

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:32.440 
they're there and of course the whole

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:35.400 
they're there and of course the whole
desk<00:04:32.860> are<00:04:33.190> on<00:04:33.550> these<00:04:33.759> wheels<00:04:34.229> now<00:04:35.229> these

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:35.410 
desk are on these wheels now these

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:38.159 
desk are on these wheels now these
wheels<00:04:35.740> are<00:04:36.240> really<00:04:37.240> high<00:04:37.389> quality<00:04:37.419> I<00:04:37.930> mean<00:04:38.139> I

00:04:38.159 --> 00:04:38.169 
wheels are really high quality I mean I

00:04:38.169 --> 00:04:39.870 
wheels are really high quality I mean I
gotta<00:04:38.380> tell<00:04:38.560> you<00:04:38.650> they<00:04:38.770> roll<00:04:39.520> around<00:04:39.550> the

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:39.880 
gotta tell you they roll around the

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:42.810 
gotta tell you they roll around the
carpet<00:04:40.300> very<00:04:40.570> easily<00:04:41.610> hopefully<00:04:42.610> eventually

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:42.820 
carpet very easily hopefully eventually

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:44.909 
carpet very easily hopefully eventually
will<00:04:43.240> be<00:04:43.330> getting<00:04:43.630> hardwood<00:04:44.440> floors<00:04:44.740> and

00:04:44.909 --> 00:04:44.919 
will be getting hardwood floors and

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:49.339 
will be getting hardwood floors and
they'll<00:04:45.070> roll<00:04:45.340> around<00:04:45.400> even<00:04:45.759> more<00:04:46.630> easy<00:04:47.280> so

00:04:49.339 --> 00:04:49.349 
they'll roll around even more easy so

00:04:49.349 --> 00:04:51.960 
they'll roll around even more easy so
the<00:04:50.349> desk<00:04:50.620> is<00:04:50.830> kind<00:04:51.070> of<00:04:51.130> like<00:04:51.220> a<00:04:51.280> kidney<00:04:51.729> bean

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:51.970 
the desk is kind of like a kidney bean

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:57.000 
the desk is kind of like a kidney bean
shape<00:04:52.770> I<00:04:53.880> used<00:04:55.199> one<00:04:56.199> of<00:04:56.229> the<00:04:56.440> straight<00:04:56.800> edges

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:57.010 
shape I used one of the straight edges

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:58.589 
shape I used one of the straight edges
there's<00:04:57.370> a<00:04:57.460> straight<00:04:57.820> edge<00:04:57.970> on<00:04:58.150> this<00:04:58.360> side

00:04:58.589 --> 00:04:58.599 
there's a straight edge on this side

00:04:58.599 --> 00:05:00.450 
there's a straight edge on this side
it's<00:04:59.080> just<00:04:59.380> straight<00:04:59.710> so<00:04:59.889> I<00:04:59.949> can<00:05:00.130> put<00:05:00.280> it<00:05:00.370> up

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:00.460 
it's just straight so I can put it up

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:03.629 
it's just straight so I can put it up
against<00:05:00.820> anything<00:05:01.000> if<00:05:01.210> I<00:05:01.360> ever<00:05:01.810> wanted<00:05:02.440> to<00:05:02.639> but

00:05:03.629 --> 00:05:03.639 
against anything if I ever wanted to but

00:05:03.639 --> 00:05:05.310 
against anything if I ever wanted to but
the<00:05:03.789> radius<00:05:04.270> actually<00:05:04.750> helps<00:05:05.050> when<00:05:05.199> you're

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:05.320 
the radius actually helps when you're

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:06.870 
the radius actually helps when you're
getting<00:05:05.440> through<00:05:05.740> doorways<00:05:06.039> are<00:05:06.550> the

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:06.880 
getting through doorways are the

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:12.180 
getting through doorways are the
controls<00:05:07.360> and<00:05:09.240> then<00:05:10.240> I<00:05:10.419> got<00:05:10.630> my<00:05:10.840> have<00:05:11.770> a<00:05:11.800> card

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:12.190 
controls and then I got my have a card

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:16.140 
controls and then I got my have a card
reader<00:05:12.370> that<00:05:13.150> will<00:05:13.389> read<00:05:13.800> for<00:05:15.150> photographic

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:16.150 
reader that will read for photographic

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:22.860 
reader that will read for photographic
and<00:05:16.389> video<00:05:17.340> cards<00:05:18.340> and<00:05:20.280> then<00:05:21.870> mounted

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:22.870 
and video cards and then mounted

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:24.930 
and video cards and then mounted
underneath<00:05:23.139> I<00:05:23.409> use<00:05:23.620> plumber's<00:05:24.159> tape<00:05:24.190> to<00:05:24.699> mount

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:24.940 
underneath I use plumber's tape to mount

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:26.700 
underneath I use plumber's tape to mount
underneath<00:05:25.210> there<00:05:25.840> it's<00:05:26.050> very<00:05:26.380> inexpensive

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:26.710 
underneath there it's very inexpensive

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:30.659 
underneath there it's very inexpensive
and<00:05:27.460> it<00:05:28.330> works<00:05:28.539> very<00:05:28.659> well<00:05:29.039> to<00:05:30.039> protect<00:05:30.490> the

00:05:30.659 --> 00:05:30.669 
and it works very well to protect the

00:05:30.669 --> 00:05:34.140 
and it works very well to protect the
equipment<00:05:31.599> I<00:05:31.750> used<00:05:32.099> like<00:05:33.099> gaffers<00:05:33.639> tape<00:05:33.669> or

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:34.150 
equipment I used like gaffers tape or

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:37.620 
equipment I used like gaffers tape or
even<00:05:34.659> duct<00:05:34.930> tape<00:05:35.199> between<00:05:36.130> the<00:05:36.580> the<00:05:37.240> unit

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:37.630 
even duct tape between the the unit

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:39.689 
even duct tape between the the unit
itself<00:05:37.750> and<00:05:38.380> the<00:05:38.710> plumbers<00:05:39.099> tape<00:05:39.310> that

00:05:39.689 --> 00:05:39.699 
itself and the plumbers tape that

00:05:39.699 --> 00:05:44.330 
itself and the plumbers tape that
protects<00:05:40.210> the<00:05:40.530> that<00:05:41.530> part<00:05:41.830> of<00:05:41.889> the<00:05:41.949> unit

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:48.860 

here's<00:05:44.970> a<00:05:45.030> g6<00:05:45.600> keyboard<00:05:46.230> and<00:05:46.699> that<00:05:47.699> is<00:05:47.940> worked

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:48.870 
here's a g6 keyboard and that is worked

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:52.370 
here's a g6 keyboard and that is worked
out<00:05:49.050> very<00:05:49.110> well<00:05:49.730> monitors<00:05:50.730> and<00:05:51.150> once<00:05:52.110> in<00:05:52.290> a

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:52.380 
out very well monitors and once in a

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:55.010 
out very well monitors and once in a
sous<00:05:52.650> monitor<00:05:53.220> and<00:05:53.510> that's<00:05:54.510> just<00:05:54.750> for

00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:55.020 
sous monitor and that's just for

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:56.780 
sous monitor and that's just for
economic<00:05:55.650> reasons<00:05:55.860> otherwise<00:05:56.370> I<00:05:56.550> would<00:05:56.669> be

00:05:56.780 --> 00:05:56.790 
economic reasons otherwise I would be

00:05:56.790 --> 00:05:59.780 
economic reasons otherwise I would be
having<00:05:57.660> to<00:05:57.990> Apple<00:05:58.350> monitors<00:05:58.830> but<00:05:59.160> eventually

00:05:59.780 --> 00:05:59.790 
having to Apple monitors but eventually

00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:03.920 
having to Apple monitors but eventually
i'll<00:06:00.120> have<00:06:00.270> a<00:06:00.320> 4k<00:06:01.320> monitor<00:06:01.979> now<00:06:02.370> the<00:06:02.930> circuit

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:03.930 
i'll have a 4k monitor now the circuit

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:07.280 
i'll have a 4k monitor now the circuit
Ron<00:06:04.139> arm<00:06:04.410> that's<00:06:04.770> my<00:06:05.250> macbook<00:06:05.699> pro<00:06:06.030> I<00:06:06.389> did<00:06:07.260> a

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:07.290 
Ron arm that's my macbook pro I did a

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:09.950 
Ron arm that's my macbook pro I did a
2-inch<00:06:07.620> hole<00:06:07.830> so<00:06:08.130> in<00:06:08.250> case<00:06:08.460> later<00:06:09.360> on<00:06:09.630> I<00:06:09.660> can

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:09.960 
2-inch hole so in case later on I can

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:11.390 
2-inch hole so in case later on I can
convert<00:06:10.380> that<00:06:10.530> to<00:06:10.710> something<00:06:10.949> that<00:06:11.100> I<00:06:11.280> would

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:11.400 
convert that to something that I would

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:16.340 
convert that to something that I would
want<00:06:11.660> it<00:06:13.010> here<00:06:14.010> just<00:06:14.340> for<00:06:14.490> the<00:06:14.840> macbook<00:06:15.840> and

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:16.350 
want it here just for the macbook and

00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:20.750 
want it here just for the macbook and
the<00:06:17.190> hard<00:06:17.550> drives<00:06:17.880> and<00:06:18.860> then<00:06:19.860> there's<00:06:20.580> a<00:06:20.610> lot

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:20.760 
the hard drives and then there's a lot

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:23.120 
the hard drives and then there's a lot
of<00:06:20.790> grommets<00:06:21.210> throughout<00:06:21.570> the<00:06:21.750> whole<00:06:22.130> which

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:23.130 
of grommets throughout the whole which

00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:27.800 
of grommets throughout the whole which
I'll<00:06:23.310> show<00:06:23.550> a<00:06:23.580> picture<00:06:23.880> of<00:06:24.180> I<00:06:26.540> have<00:06:27.540> the<00:06:27.660> way<00:06:27.780> a

I'll show a picture of I have the way a

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:30.340 
I'll show a picture of I have the way a

comp tab before it's a medium sized
tablet<00:06:31.350> and<00:06:31.530> this<00:06:32.400> is<00:06:32.610> for<00:06:32.790> drawing<00:06:33.320> I<00:06:34.320> put<00:06:35.310> the

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:35.490 
tablet and this is for drawing I put the

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:40.190 
tablet and this is for drawing I put the
pen<00:06:37.070> visually<00:06:38.070> along<00:06:38.760> with<00:06:38.910> this<00:06:39.060> base<00:06:39.360> so

00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:40.200 
pen visually along with this base so

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:41.629 
pen visually along with this base so
that<00:06:40.229> when<00:06:40.530> I<00:06:40.560> can<00:06:40.770> grab<00:06:41.010> it<00:06:41.130> and<00:06:41.250> when<00:06:41.400> I'm<00:06:41.490> not

that when I can grab it and when I'm not
using<00:06:41.700> it<00:06:42.240> you<00:06:42.449> don't<00:06:42.630> pay<00:06:42.810> attention<00:06:42.900> to<00:06:43.289> it

00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:43.500 
using it you don't pay attention to it

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:45.740 
using it you don't pay attention to it
because<00:06:43.530> it's<00:06:43.949> for<00:06:44.669> once<00:06:44.850> the<00:06:44.970> same<00:06:45.180> color<00:06:45.479> and
