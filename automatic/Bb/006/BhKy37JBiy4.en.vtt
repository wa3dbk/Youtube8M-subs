awaiting fans of the settlers like the
new<00:00:31.590> victory<00:00:32.099> point<00:00:32.340> system<00:00:32.790> but<00:00:33.719> how<00:00:33.899> do

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
new victory point system but how do

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.310 
new victory point system but how do
victory<00:00:34.590> points<00:00:34.950> work<00:00:35.160> I<00:00:35.960> think<00:00:36.960> it<00:00:37.050> gives<00:00:37.170> a

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
victory points work I think it gives a

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.290 
victory points work I think it gives a
player<00:00:37.530> of<00:00:37.710> flexibility<00:00:38.280> different<00:00:38.940> ways<00:00:39.089> to

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
player of flexibility different ways to

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.930 
player of flexibility different ways to
win<00:00:39.679> you<00:00:40.679> can<00:00:40.829> you<00:00:41.070> can<00:00:41.219> adjust<00:00:41.309> the<00:00:41.760> way<00:00:41.879> you

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
win you can you can adjust the way you

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.819 
win you can you can adjust the way you
play<00:00:42.300> it<00:00:42.449> to<00:00:42.539> your<00:00:42.660> particular<00:00:42.870> style<00:00:43.379> if<00:00:43.679> you

play it to your particular style if you

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.250

you like the planning and the detail you
can<00:00:50.399> work<00:00:50.609> on<00:00:50.789> trade<00:00:51.629> possibly<00:00:52.260> or<00:00:52.859> the

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
can work on trade possibly or the

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.470 
can work on trade possibly or the
technology<00:00:53.519> that<00:00:53.550> just<00:00:53.850> we<00:00:54.120> just<00:00:54.300> give<00:00:54.390> the

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
work let's get more detailed of course

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.340 
work let's get more detailed of course
the<00:01:02.670> numerous<00:01:03.059> gameplay<00:01:03.629> opportunities

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
the numerous gameplay opportunities

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.250 
the numerous gameplay opportunities
bring<00:01:04.890> a<00:01:05.010> lot<00:01:05.220> of<00:01:05.250> variety<00:01:05.940> into<00:01:06.090> the<00:01:06.300> game<00:01:06.510> so

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
bring a lot of variety into the game so

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.150 
bring a lot of variety into the game so
we<00:01:07.409> asked<00:01:07.800> how<00:01:08.370> does<00:01:08.670> that<00:01:08.880> work<00:01:09.210> in<00:01:09.450> practice

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:10.160 
we asked how does that work in practice

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:12.680 
we asked how does that work in practice
ok<00:01:11.160> the<00:01:11.250> victor<00:01:11.760> point<00:01:11.970> system<00:01:12.240> is<00:01:12.330> like<00:01:12.480> is

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:12.690 
ok the victor point system is like is

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:14.090 
ok the victor point system is like is
borrowed<00:01:13.050> a<00:01:13.170> little<00:01:13.350> bit<00:01:13.440> from<00:01:13.590> board<00:01:13.830> gaming

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
borrowed a little bit from board gaming

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.740 
borrowed a little bit from board gaming
so<00:01:14.880> you<00:01:14.940> can<00:01:15.120> think<00:01:15.150> of<00:01:15.360> a<00:01:15.390> plan<00:01:15.540> a<00:01:15.600> strategy

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
so you can think of a plan a strategy

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.780 
so you can think of a plan a strategy
board<00:01:16.320> game<00:01:16.440> and<00:01:16.680> how<00:01:16.950> the<00:01:17.010> victory<00:01:17.430> points

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
board game and how the victory points

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.400 
board game and how the victory points
are<00:01:17.880> in<00:01:18.000> play<00:01:18.270> and<00:01:18.570> you're<00:01:18.720> striving<00:01:19.110> for

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:19.410 
are in play and you're striving for

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:21.110 
are in play and you're striving for
different<00:01:19.650> goals<00:01:19.860> now<00:01:20.550> it<00:01:20.700> works<00:01:20.880> in<00:01:21.060> a

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:21.120 
different goals now it works in a

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:23.510 
different goals now it works in a
computer<00:01:21.150> game<00:01:21.800> like<00:01:22.800> an<00:01:22.950> example<00:01:23.340> was

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
computer game like an example was

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.100 
computer game like an example was
yesterday<00:01:23.850> we<00:01:23.910> were<00:01:24.000> playing<00:01:24.210> a<00:01:24.270> game<00:01:24.300> and<00:01:24.510> I

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
yesterday we were playing a game and I

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.740 
yesterday we were playing a game and I
was<00:01:25.320> expanding<00:01:26.130> along<00:01:26.370> the<00:01:26.490> trade<00:01:26.820> an<00:01:27.120> Avenue

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
was expanding along the trade an Avenue

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.870 
was expanding along the trade an Avenue
one<00:01:28.350> of<00:01:28.440> my<00:01:28.500> competitors<00:01:28.830> are<00:01:29.160> expanding<00:01:29.790> in

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
one of my competitors are expanding in

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.030 
one of my competitors are expanding in
technology<00:01:30.510> and<00:01:30.720> then<00:01:31.290> we<00:01:31.380> had<00:01:31.500> to<00:01:31.590> cross<00:01:31.770> over

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
technology and then we had to cross over

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.350 
technology and then we had to cross over
a<00:01:32.190> little<00:01:32.310> bit<00:01:32.460> because<00:01:32.640> I<00:01:32.880> wanted<00:01:33.150> to<00:01:33.240> take

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
a little bit because I wanted to take

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:34.670 
a little bit because I wanted to take
some<00:01:33.600> of<00:01:33.630> the<00:01:33.750> technology<00:01:34.200> from<00:01:34.350> him<00:01:34.560> he

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
some of the technology from him he

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:35.870 
some of the technology from him he
wanted<00:01:34.920> to<00:01:34.980> take<00:01:35.070> some<00:01:35.190> trade<00:01:35.460> away<00:01:35.550> from<00:01:35.730> me

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
wanted to take some trade away from me

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.270 
wanted to take some trade away from me
and<00:01:36.630> in<00:01:36.930> the<00:01:37.020> meantime<00:01:37.110> we're<00:01:37.500> both<00:01:37.680> pursuing

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
and in the meantime we're both pursuing

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.280 
and in the meantime we're both pursuing
military<00:01:38.790> options<00:01:39.270> trying<00:01:39.630> to<00:01:39.720> first<00:01:40.200> to

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
military options trying to first to

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:41.510 
military options trying to first to
defend<00:01:40.530> ourselves<00:01:40.650> and<00:01:41.070> then<00:01:41.160> maybe<00:01:41.310> be

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
defend ourselves and then maybe be

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.160 
defend ourselves and then maybe be
aggressive<00:01:41.970> about<00:01:42.060> taking<00:01:42.540> space<00:01:42.900> away<00:01:43.080> from

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
aggressive about taking space away from

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.530 
aggressive about taking space away from
someone<00:01:43.590> else<00:01:43.740> i<00:01:43.980> mean<00:01:44.880> i<00:01:44.940> think<00:01:45.030> that<00:01:45.360> the

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
someone else i mean i think that the

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.270 
someone else i mean i think that the
game<00:01:45.720> just<00:01:45.900> gives<00:01:46.200> it<00:01:46.290> the<00:01:46.590> victory<00:01:47.010> points

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280

give you a lot more a whole strategic
way<00:01:49.170> of<00:01:49.320> thinking<00:01:49.650> about<00:01:49.710> playing<00:01:50.100> it's<00:01:50.370> not

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
way of thinking about playing it's not

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.600 
way of thinking about playing it's not
so<00:01:50.730> much<00:01:50.940> just<00:01:51.630> a<00:01:51.750> small<00:01:52.140> game<00:01:52.470> or<00:01:52.830> a<00:01:52.920> finite

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
so much just a small game or a finite

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.760
