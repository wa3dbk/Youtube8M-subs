trilogy but that doesn't necessarily

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:42.600 
trilogy but that doesn't necessarily
mean<00:00:40.870> that<00:00:40.930> there<00:00:41.260> won't<00:00:41.290> be<00:00:41.620> more<00:00:41.920> games<00:00:42.220> in<00:00:42.460> E

jak and daxter universe that even

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:47.460 
jak and daxter universe that even
feature<00:00:45.579> and<00:00:46.059> focus<00:00:46.540> on<00:00:46.690> the<00:00:46.780> same<00:00:46.989> characters

after<00:00:47.800> you<00:00:48.159> complete<00:00:48.670> jak<00:00:48.879> 3<00:00:48.909> you'll

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:49.300 
after you complete jak 3 you'll

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:51.149 
after you complete jak 3 you'll
understand<00:00:49.780> how<00:00:49.899> this<00:00:50.019> is<00:00:50.170> possible<00:00:50.350> but<00:00:50.920> I

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:51.159 
understand how this is possible but I

00:00:51.159 --> 00:00:52.950 
understand how this is possible but I
can't<00:00:51.640> really<00:00:51.730> get<00:00:51.940> into<00:00:51.970> that<00:00:52.269> because<00:00:52.480> the

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:52.960 
can't really get into that because the

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:54.479 
can't really get into that because the
game<00:00:53.140> has<00:00:53.170> a<00:00:53.350> lot<00:00:53.589> of<00:00:53.620> twists<00:00:54.070> in<00:00:54.159> terms<00:00:54.339> of

00:00:54.479 --> 00:00:54.489 
game has a lot of twists in terms of

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:57.930 
game has a lot of twists in terms of
storylines<00:00:55.140> what<00:00:56.140> it<00:00:56.260> does<00:00:56.440> do<00:00:56.649> is<00:00:56.680> wrap<00:00:57.609> up<00:00:57.850> a

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:57.940 
storylines what it does do is wrap up a

00:00:57.940 --> 00:00:59.670 
storylines what it does do is wrap up a
lot<00:00:58.090> of<00:00:58.120> the<00:00:58.300> loose<00:00:58.449> ends<00:00:58.780> from<00:00:58.899> Jack<00:00:59.170> to<00:00:59.350> and

great<00:01:18.039> segment<00:01:18.720> unfortunately<00:01:19.720> the<00:01:19.810> gameplay

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:20.140 
great segment unfortunately the gameplay

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:22.200 
great segment unfortunately the gameplay

about<00:01:24.399> 10<00:01:24.729> hours<00:01:24.940> maybe<00:01:25.450> 15<00:01:25.990> if<00:01:26.170> you<00:01:26.200> take

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:26.500 
about 10 hours maybe 15 if you take

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:27.690 
about 10 hours maybe 15 if you take

are pretty exciting the hoverboarding is
more<00:02:48.940> developed<00:02:49.210> and<00:02:49.630> it<00:02:49.870> wasn't<00:02:50.200> Jack<00:02:50.380> to

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:50.560 
more developed and it wasn't Jack to

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:52.050 
more developed and it wasn't Jack to
it's<00:02:50.800> a<00:02:50.890> lot<00:02:51.040> easier<00:02:51.070> to<00:02:51.460> come<00:02:51.610> to<00:02:51.730> grips<00:02:51.850> with

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:52.060 
it's a lot easier to come to grips with

around<00:02:54.310> it<00:02:54.670> or<00:02:54.850> seemed<00:02:55.350> balance<00:02:56.350> a<00:02:56.470> little

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:56.680 
around it or seemed balance a little

better the on Rails shooting components
are<00:02:58.630> more<00:02:58.780> exciting<00:02:59.290> the<00:02:59.530> actual<00:03:00.430> platforming

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:01.090 
are more exciting the actual platforming

really<00:03:07.810> much<00:03:08.410> bigger<00:03:08.800> than<00:03:08.890> it<00:03:09.190> was<00:03:09.310> before

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:11.740 
even if the actual experience is so much

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:13.650

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:24.670 
involves dying a lot because it's pretty

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:26.449 
involves dying a lot because it's pretty
challenging<00:03:25.209> game<00:03:25.420> it's<00:03:25.720> not<00:03:25.810> nearly<00:03:26.050> as<00:03:26.170> a

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:26.459

frustratingly difficult as Jack to was
but<00:03:29.709> it's<00:03:29.830> so<00:03:30.010> challenging<00:03:30.220> that<00:03:30.810> I'd<00:03:31.810> say

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:32.080 
but it's so challenging that I'd say

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:34.410 
but it's so challenging that I'd say
roughly<00:03:32.500> seventy<00:03:33.370> five<00:03:33.520> eighty<00:03:33.819> percent<00:03:34.090> of

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:34.420 
roughly seventy five eighty percent of

all of the missions that you undertake

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:37.710 
all of the missions that you undertake

enough to allow me to win the only thing
i<00:04:16.000> am<00:04:16.120> thinking<00:04:16.299> is<00:04:16.599> that<00:04:16.630> everything's<00:04:17.380> so

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:17.560 
i am thinking is that everything's so

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:19.229 
i am thinking is that everything's so
responsive<00:04:18.160> but<00:04:18.280> the<00:04:18.430> only<00:04:18.609> way<00:04:18.880> i'm<00:04:19.030> actually

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:19.239 
responsive but the only way i'm actually

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:21.569 
responsive but the only way i'm actually
losing<00:04:19.930> is<00:04:20.289> because<00:04:20.530> i'm<00:04:20.680> simply<00:04:21.130> not<00:04:21.310> good

00:04:21.569 --> 00:04:21.579 
losing is because i'm simply not good

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:23.520 
losing is because i'm simply not good
enough<00:04:21.880> to<00:04:22.030> defeat<00:04:22.330> this<00:04:22.509> challenge<00:04:22.990> as<00:04:23.470> i

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:23.530 
enough to defeat this challenge as i

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:24.990 
enough to defeat this challenge as i
mentioned<00:04:23.650> in<00:04:23.979> my<00:04:24.009> review<00:04:24.370> it's<00:04:24.699> a<00:04:24.789> little

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:25.000

tough<00:04:25.180> to<00:04:25.210> admit<00:04:25.419> this<00:04:25.750> just<00:04:26.020> off<00:04:26.169> the<00:04:26.289> bat<00:04:26.470> you

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:26.650 
tough to admit this just off the bat you

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:28.290 
tough to admit this just off the bat you
know<00:04:26.680> what<00:04:26.860> i<00:04:26.889> suck<00:04:27.250> at<00:04:27.280> a<00:04:27.460> game<00:04:27.669> but<00:04:28.060> it's<00:04:28.180> not

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:28.300 
know what i suck at a game but it's not

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:29.730 
know what i suck at a game but it's not
really<00:04:28.419> like<00:04:28.509> that<00:04:28.690> it's<00:04:29.020> that<00:04:29.169> the<00:04:29.380> game<00:04:29.560> gets

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:29.740 
really like that it's that the game gets

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:31.800 
really like that it's that the game gets
harder<00:04:29.919> and<00:04:30.190> harder<00:04:30.250> so<00:04:31.150> that<00:04:31.180> when<00:04:31.509> you<00:04:31.630> do

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:31.810 
harder and harder so that when you do

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:33.870 
harder and harder so that when you do
lose<00:04:32.050> you<00:04:32.289> feel<00:04:32.500> compelled<00:04:32.919> to<00:04:33.039> jump<00:04:33.340> back<00:04:33.490> in
