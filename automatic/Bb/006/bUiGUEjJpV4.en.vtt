all<00:00:02.010> right<00:00:02.480> let's<00:00:03.480> take<00:00:03.570> apart<00:00:03.810> some<00:00:03.870> stress<00:00:04.170> I

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:04.350 
all right let's take apart some stress I

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:07.130 
all right let's take apart some stress I
figured<00:00:04.620> I'd<00:00:04.740> do<00:00:05.069> a<00:00:05.100> quick<00:00:05.339> video<00:00:05.819> on<00:00:06.000> it<00:00:06.270> this

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:07.140 
figured I'd do a quick video on it this

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:08.690 
figured I'd do a quick video on it this
is<00:00:07.259> pretty<00:00:07.500> easy<00:00:07.740> but<00:00:08.099> it<00:00:08.250> can<00:00:08.280> seem<00:00:08.519> pretty

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:08.700 
is pretty easy but it can seem pretty

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.150 
is pretty easy but it can seem pretty
daunting<00:00:09.349> really<00:00:10.349> the<00:00:10.440> only<00:00:10.650> tools<00:00:10.860> you<00:00:11.010> need

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160 
daunting really the only tools you need

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.240 
daunting really the only tools you need
to<00:00:11.280> take<00:00:11.429> them<00:00:11.580> apart<00:00:12.769> spring<00:00:13.769> compressors

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
to take them apart spring compressors

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.180 
to take them apart spring compressors
you<00:00:14.849> can<00:00:14.969> rent<00:00:15.150> these<00:00:15.240> it<00:00:15.740> auto<00:00:16.740> parts<00:00:17.039> or

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
you can rent these it auto parts or

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.090 
you can rent these it auto parts or
Cregan<00:00:17.789> wherever<00:00:18.660> Oh<00:00:18.900> Riley's<00:00:19.320> and<00:00:19.560> then<00:00:20.070> I

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
Cregan wherever Oh Riley's and then I

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.929 
Cregan wherever Oh Riley's and then I
use<00:00:20.460> a<00:00:21.230> wireless<00:00:22.230> impact<00:00:22.859> it's<00:00:23.369> pretty<00:00:23.640> handy

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
use a wireless impact it's pretty handy

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:26.300 
use a wireless impact it's pretty handy
you<00:00:24.300> can<00:00:24.449> do<00:00:24.539> it<00:00:24.660> in<00:00:24.750> just<00:00:24.869> a<00:00:24.960> few<00:00:25.109> minutes<00:00:25.310> this

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
you can do it in just a few minutes this

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.019 
you can do it in just a few minutes this
is<00:00:26.490> the<00:00:26.580> front<00:00:26.820> strut<00:00:27.150> for<00:00:27.420> an<00:00:27.510> mr2<00:00:28.849> this<00:00:29.849> one

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
is the front strut for an mr2 this one

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:31.820 
is the front strut for an mr2 this one
is<00:00:30.150> really<00:00:30.539> together<00:00:30.779> I<00:00:31.080> just<00:00:31.439> put<00:00:31.560> the<00:00:31.679> nut

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
is really together I just put the nut

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.860 
is really together I just put the nut
back<00:00:31.859> on<00:00:32.219> just<00:00:32.430> to<00:00:32.610> kind<00:00:32.850> of<00:00:32.880> show<00:00:33.059> you<00:00:33.120> this<00:00:33.719> is

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
back on just to kind of show you this is

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.299 
back on just to kind of show you this is
more<00:00:34.110> tricky<00:00:34.380> because<00:00:34.739> you<00:00:34.890> don't<00:00:35.040> have<00:00:35.190> as

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
more tricky because you don't have as

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:38.119 
more tricky because you don't have as
many<00:00:35.430> coils<00:00:36.329> on<00:00:36.630> the<00:00:36.660> spring<00:00:37.050> but<00:00:37.739> the<00:00:37.829> basic

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
many coils on the spring but the basic

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:43.040 
many coils on the spring but the basic
idea<00:00:38.430> is<00:00:39.020> you<00:00:40.020> get<00:00:40.350> the<00:00:40.940> on<00:00:41.940> one<00:00:42.210> side<00:00:42.480> when<00:00:42.960> the

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
idea is you get the on one side when the

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.110 
idea is you get the on one side when the
spring<00:00:43.320> comes<00:00:43.500> up<00:00:43.710> close<00:00:44.489> the<00:00:44.640> spring<00:00:44.910> mount

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
spring comes up close the spring mount

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.830 
spring comes up close the spring mount
get<00:00:45.980> one<00:00:46.980> of<00:00:47.370> these<00:00:47.850> as<00:00:48.090> high<00:00:48.270> up<00:00:48.420> as<00:00:48.510> you<00:00:48.660> can

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
get one of these as high up as you can

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.310 
get one of these as high up as you can
against<00:00:49.680> that<00:00:49.890> one<00:00:50.129> and<00:00:50.690> then<00:00:51.690> on<00:00:51.809> the<00:00:51.930> second

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
against that one and then on the second

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.000 
against that one and then on the second
side<00:00:53.059> you<00:00:54.059> get<00:00:54.320> where<00:00:55.320> the<00:00:55.410> spring<00:00:55.649> comes<00:00:55.829> down

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
side you get where the spring comes down

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.689 
side you get where the spring comes down
to<00:00:56.129> the<00:00:56.219> bottom<00:00:56.370> here<00:00:56.610> you<00:00:57.050> get<00:00:58.050> this<00:00:58.469> one<00:00:58.770> as

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
to the bottom here you get this one as

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.049 
to the bottom here you get this one as
part<00:01:00.030> over<00:01:00.690> as<00:01:00.809> you<00:01:00.960> can<00:01:01.170> there<00:01:01.500> and<00:01:02.030> grab<00:01:03.030> it

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
part over as you can there and grab it

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:06.230 
part over as you can there and grab it
like<00:01:03.449> this<00:01:03.930> and<00:01:04.229> then<00:01:04.830> using<00:01:05.309> the<00:01:05.880> impact

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
like this and then using the impact

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.929 
like this and then using the impact
which<00:01:06.540> is<00:01:06.570> 19<00:01:07.260> millimeter<00:01:07.710> you<00:01:08.280> can<00:01:08.460> zap<00:01:08.670> these

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
which is 19 millimeter you can zap these

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:11.539 
which is 19 millimeter you can zap these
things<00:01:09.360> down<00:01:09.689> compress<00:01:10.500> the<00:01:10.650> spring<00:01:10.860> and<00:01:11.189> then

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
things down compress the spring and then

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.060 
things down compress the spring and then
conveniently<00:01:11.850> enough<00:01:12.450> the<00:01:12.720> nut<00:01:13.350> on<00:01:13.500> top<00:01:13.530> is

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
conveniently enough the nut on top is

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:15.649 
conveniently enough the nut on top is
also<00:01:14.369> 19<00:01:14.760> millimeter<00:01:15.150> you<00:01:15.270> might<00:01:15.450> have<00:01:15.630> a

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
also 19 millimeter you might have a

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.770 
also 19 millimeter you might have a
tough<00:01:16.200> time<00:01:16.409> getting<00:01:16.770> it<00:01:16.860> off<00:01:16.979> without<00:01:17.220> a

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:17.780 
tough time getting it off without a

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:19.640 
tough time getting it off without a
impact

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
impact

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.380 
impact
you<00:01:20.040> don't<00:01:20.220> need<00:01:20.310> an<00:01:20.430> impact<00:01:20.729> obviously<00:01:21.210> for

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
you don't need an impact obviously for

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.170 
you don't need an impact obviously for
these<00:01:21.570> it<00:01:21.780> just<00:01:22.259> makes<00:01:22.619> life<00:01:22.890> a<00:01:22.979> lot<00:01:23.070> faster<00:01:23.580> so

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
these it just makes life a lot faster so

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.940 
these it just makes life a lot faster so
that's<00:01:24.360> how<00:01:24.570> you<00:01:24.630> do<00:01:24.900> the<00:01:25.200> front<00:01:25.680> I'll

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
that's how you do the front I'll

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.609 
that's how you do the front I'll
actually<00:01:26.130> show<00:01:26.310> you<00:01:26.520> right<00:01:27.270> now<00:01:27.330> how<00:01:28.320> to<00:01:28.350> do

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
actually show you right now how to do

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.319 
actually show you right now how to do
the<00:01:28.740> rears<00:01:29.540> let<00:01:30.540> me<00:01:30.630> just<00:01:30.840> get<00:01:30.990> these<00:01:31.140> things

00:01:32.319 --> 00:01:32.329 
the rears let me just get these things

00:01:32.329 --> 00:01:34.490 
the rears let me just get these things
again<00:01:33.329> this<00:01:33.450> one's<00:01:33.659> actually<00:01:33.810> only<00:01:34.170> held<00:01:34.380> on

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
again this one's actually only held on

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.560 
again this one's actually only held on
luckily<00:01:34.920> these<00:01:35.100> Springs<00:01:35.850> aren't<00:01:36.060> compressed

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
luckily these Springs aren't compressed

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.530 
luckily these Springs aren't compressed
too<00:01:36.930> crazy<00:01:37.549> but<00:01:38.549> I<00:01:38.579> wouldn't<00:01:38.880> suggest<00:01:39.030> doing

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
too crazy but I wouldn't suggest doing

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.179 
too crazy but I wouldn't suggest doing
it<00:01:39.750> without<00:01:40.049> the<00:01:40.229> spring<00:01:40.470> compressor<00:01:40.950> you<00:01:41.040> can

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
it without the spring compressor you can

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:44.300 
it without the spring compressor you can
see<00:01:41.600> is<00:01:42.600> I<00:01:42.750> don't<00:01:42.810> have<00:01:42.960> the<00:01:43.049> top<00:01:43.829> strut<00:01:44.130> mount

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
see is I don't have the top strut mount

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:44.749 
see is I don't have the top strut mount
on<00:01:44.460> here

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
on here

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:49.810 
on here
but<00:01:45.750> boom<00:01:45.990> it<00:01:46.530> comes<00:01:46.740> off

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:49.820 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:55.149 

now<00:01:51.590> the<00:01:52.590> bottoms<00:01:52.950> this<00:01:53.040> one<00:01:53.250> is<00:01:53.400> still<00:01:54.390> live

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:55.159 
now the bottoms this one is still live

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:59.539 
now the bottoms this one is still live
you<00:01:56.159> have<00:01:56.220> a<00:01:56.310> lot<00:01:56.460> more<00:01:56.990> coils<00:01:58.009> this<00:01:59.009> is<00:01:59.190> real

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
you have a lot more coils this is real

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:03.070 
you have a lot more coils this is real
easy<00:02:00.170> just<00:02:01.170> pick<00:02:01.770> a<00:02:01.799> couple<00:02:02.040> convenient<00:02:02.700> one

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:03.080 
easy just pick a couple convenient one

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:06.499 
easy just pick a couple convenient one
since<00:02:04.080> this<00:02:04.290> thing<00:02:04.470> is<00:02:04.680> still<00:02:05.070> kind<00:02:05.340> of<00:02:05.390> set<00:02:06.390> up

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
since this thing is still kind of set up

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:19.460 
since this thing is still kind of set up
for<00:02:06.950> what<00:02:07.950> the<00:02:08.100> front<00:02:17.959> putting<00:02:18.959> just<00:02:19.110> a<00:02:19.230> little

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:11.950 
cars the rusting and all that so how do

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:14.610 
cars the rusting and all that so how do
you<00:04:12.070> deal<00:04:12.220> with<00:04:12.250> that<00:04:12.660> we<00:04:13.660> can<00:04:13.810> see<00:04:13.960> here<00:04:14.290> I<00:04:14.320> got

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:14.620 
you deal with that we can see here I got

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:17.250 
you deal with that we can see here I got
the<00:04:14.860> the<00:04:15.550> spring<00:04:15.790> compressors<00:04:16.270> on<00:04:16.450> and<00:04:16.720> the

the the spring compressors on and the

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.710 
the the spring compressors on and the
spring<00:04:17.470> is<00:04:17.590> compressed<00:04:17.910> the<00:04:18.910> first<00:04:19.120> issue<00:04:19.360> was

00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:19.720 
spring is compressed the first issue was

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:22.170 
spring is compressed the first issue was
that<00:04:19.989> this<00:04:20.260> not<00:04:20.830> was<00:04:21.070> a<00:04:21.100> 23<00:04:21.760> millimeter

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:22.180 
that this not was a 23 millimeter

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:24.120 
that this not was a 23 millimeter
instead<00:04:22.420> of<00:04:22.510> the<00:04:22.600> 19<00:04:22.930> rex<00:04:23.170> is<00:04:23.320> probably<00:04:23.620> a<00:04:23.710> 20

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:24.130 
instead of the 19 rex is probably a 20

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:27.330 
instead of the 19 rex is probably a 20
but<00:04:24.280> the<00:04:24.370> 23<00:04:24.760> 722<00:04:25.690> but<00:04:26.290> the<00:04:26.350> 23<00:04:26.740> seems<00:04:27.100> to<00:04:27.220> be

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:27.340 
but the 23 722 but the 23 seems to be

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:30.480 
but the 23 722 but the 23 seems to be
working<00:04:27.640> just<00:04:27.670> fine<00:04:29.040> when<00:04:30.040> I<00:04:30.070> started

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:30.490 
working just fine when I started

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:33.030 
working just fine when I started
loosening<00:04:31.390> this<00:04:31.630> top<00:04:31.900> nut<00:04:32.140> with<00:04:32.320> the<00:04:32.500> impact

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:33.040 
loosening this top nut with the impact

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:35.820 
loosening this top nut with the impact
of<00:04:33.340> course<00:04:33.910> the<00:04:34.270> entire<00:04:34.600> strut<00:04:35.110> damper

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:35.830 
of course the entire strut damper

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:37.200 
of course the entire strut damper
cylinder<00:04:36.220> started<00:04:36.490> spinning<00:04:36.730> so<00:04:37.030> this

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:37.210 
cylinder started spinning so this

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:40.230 
cylinder started spinning so this
portion<00:04:37.510> up<00:04:37.870> here<00:04:38.220> started<00:04:39.220> spinning<00:04:39.520> along

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:40.240 
portion up here started spinning along

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:41.790 
portion up here started spinning along
with<00:04:40.450> the<00:04:40.570> nut<00:04:40.810> so<00:04:41.110> I<00:04:41.140> wasn't<00:04:41.440> getting

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:41.800 
with the nut so I wasn't getting

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:44.340 
with the nut so I wasn't getting
anywhere<00:04:42.630> there's<00:04:43.630> a<00:04:43.690> couple<00:04:43.990> of<00:04:44.080> different

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:44.350 
anywhere there's a couple of different

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:46.950 
anywhere there's a couple of different
ways<00:04:44.440> you<00:04:44.470> could<00:04:44.710> try<00:04:44.890> to<00:04:45.390> to<00:04:46.390> prevent<00:04:46.840> that

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:46.960 
ways you could try to to prevent that

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:48.450 
ways you could try to to prevent that
from<00:04:47.020> happening<00:04:47.200> one<00:04:47.740> is<00:04:47.770> if<00:04:48.040> you<00:04:48.130> have<00:04:48.160> enough

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:48.460 
from happening one is if you have enough

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:50.430 
from happening one is if you have enough
piece<00:04:48.700> of<00:04:48.820> rubber<00:04:49.030> around<00:04:49.300> you<00:04:49.990> can<00:04:50.170> try<00:04:50.380> to

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:50.440 
piece of rubber around you can try to

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:53.370 
piece of rubber around you can try to
wrap<00:04:50.710> it<00:04:51.180> and<00:04:52.180> take<00:04:52.390> some<00:04:52.420> vice<00:04:52.720> grips<00:04:52.750> to<00:04:53.230> it

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:53.380 
wrap it and take some vice grips to it

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:56.370 
wrap it and take some vice grips to it
and<00:04:53.590> then<00:04:54.490> try<00:04:55.240> it<00:04:55.270> again<00:04:55.390> just<00:04:55.780> a<00:04:56.110> little<00:04:56.140> bit

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:56.380 
and then try it again just a little bit

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:58.320 
and then try it again just a little bit
tension<00:04:56.830> maybe<00:04:57.130> all<00:04:57.400> it<00:04:57.430> needs<00:04:57.790> to<00:04:58.030> get<00:04:58.150> that

00:04:58.320 --> 00:04:58.330 
tension maybe all it needs to get that

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:01.140 
tension maybe all it needs to get that
nut<00:04:58.540> loose<00:04:58.780> in<00:04:59.560> my<00:04:59.740> case<00:05:00.010> it's<00:05:00.730> got<00:05:00.850> to<00:05:01.060> the

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:01.150 
nut loose in my case it's got to the

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:03.840 
nut loose in my case it's got to the
point<00:05:01.300> where<00:05:01.540> that<00:05:01.870> wasn't<00:05:02.110> working<00:05:02.560> so<00:05:02.850> what

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:03.850 
point where that wasn't working so what

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:08.010 
point where that wasn't working so what
I<00:05:03.880> have<00:05:04.120> to<00:05:04.270> end<00:05:04.450> up<00:05:04.540> doing<00:05:04.900> is<00:05:05.520> um<00:05:07.020> the

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:08.020 
I have to end up doing is um the

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:10.680 
I have to end up doing is um the
cylinder<00:05:08.500> notice<00:05:09.130> is<00:05:09.250> nicely<00:05:09.460> polished<00:05:09.910> it's

cylinder notice is nicely polished it's
because<00:05:11.050> there's<00:05:11.410> a<00:05:11.470> seal<00:05:11.860> here<00:05:12.370> that<00:05:13.270> the

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:13.420 
because there's a seal here that the

leaking<00:05:22.690> now<00:05:23.650> you<00:05:24.580> don't<00:05:24.730> want<00:05:24.850> to<00:05:24.910> damage

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:25.090 
leaking now you don't want to damage

we're not allowed to seal and you start

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:37.320 
we're not allowed to seal and you start
getting<00:05:32.740> leakage<00:05:33.220> that<00:05:34.090> is<00:05:34.450> bad<00:05:35.820> however<00:05:36.820> at

getting leakage that is bad however at
the<00:05:37.420> very<00:05:37.600> top<00:05:37.900> here<00:05:38.230> there's<00:05:38.530> a<00:05:38.590> rubber<00:05:38.920> bump

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:39.340 
the very top here there's a rubber bump

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:41.610 
the very top here there's a rubber bump
stop<00:05:39.640> and<00:05:39.880> it's<00:05:40.510> right<00:05:40.720> here<00:05:40.960> now<00:05:41.110> I<00:05:41.140> pushed<00:05:41.440> it

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:41.620 
stop and it's right here now I pushed it

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:44.520 
stop and it's right here now I pushed it
down<00:05:41.830> it's<00:05:42.100> normally<00:05:42.430> sitting<00:05:42.760> up<00:05:42.880> inside<00:05:43.660> up

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:44.530 
down it's normally sitting up inside up

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:46.490 
down it's normally sitting up inside up
against<00:05:45.010> the<00:05:45.130> top<00:05:45.310> here<00:05:45.580> of<00:05:45.610> the<00:05:45.850> strut<00:05:46.090> mount

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:46.500 
against the top here of the strut mount

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:50.370 
against the top here of the strut mount
and<00:05:47.610> I'm<00:05:48.610> clamping<00:05:48.940> a<00:05:49.240> vise<00:05:49.390> grips<00:05:49.720> directly

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:50.380 
and I'm clamping a vise grips directly

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:52.950 
and I'm clamping a vise grips directly
to<00:05:50.650> the<00:05:51.100> cylinder<00:05:51.490> now<00:05:51.610> that<00:05:52.090> extra<00:05:52.480> bite<00:05:52.720> and

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:52.960 
to the cylinder now that extra bite and

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:55.200 
to the cylinder now that extra bite and
you<00:05:53.050> have<00:05:53.140> to<00:05:53.230> get<00:05:53.350> it<00:05:53.440> real<00:05:53.680> tight<00:05:53.980> is<00:05:54.430> what<00:05:55.060> it

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:55.210 
you have to get it real tight is what it

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:58.380 
you have to get it real tight is what it
required<00:05:55.780> to<00:05:56.020> get<00:05:56.140> this<00:05:56.350> file<00:05:56.560> nut<00:05:56.890> up<00:05:57.040> so<00:05:57.390> that

00:05:58.380 --> 00:05:58.390 
required to get this file nut up so that

00:05:58.390 --> 00:06:00.330 
required to get this file nut up so that
would<00:05:58.570> be<00:05:58.780> one<00:05:59.230> suggestion<00:05:59.650> if<00:06:00.010> you're<00:06:00.160> having

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:00.340 
would be one suggestion if you're having

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:03.480 
would be one suggestion if you're having
a<00:06:00.550> particularly<00:06:01.540> difficult<00:06:02.490> strut

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:03.490 
a particularly difficult strut

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:05.670 
a particularly difficult strut
disassembly<00:06:04.180> so<00:06:04.420> all<00:06:05.080> right<00:06:05.230> good<00:06:05.410> luck<00:06:05.500> with

00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:05.680 
disassembly so all right good luck with

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:08.439 
disassembly so all right good luck with
all<00:06:05.770> your<00:06:05.830> endeavors

00:06:08.439 --> 00:06:08.449
