00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:53.740 
one weird thing I noticed what this goes
it<00:03:50.280> was<00:03:50.400> red<00:03:50.640> in<00:03:50.790> the<00:03:50.880> front<00:03:51.180> so<00:03:52.160> maybe<00:03:53.160> that's

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:53.750 
it was red in the front so maybe that's

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:56.089 
it was red in the front so maybe that's
something<00:03:54.750> for<00:03:54.900> our<00:03:55.110> future<00:03:55.230> deals<00:03:55.560> he<00:03:55.770> may<00:03:56.040> be

00:03:56.089 --> 00:03:56.099 
something for our future deals he may be

00:03:56.099 --> 00:04:03.320 
something for our future deals he may be
like<00:03:56.280> the<00:03:58.489> house<00:03:59.489> of<00:03:59.850> I<00:04:02.090> forgot<00:04:03.090> what<00:04:03.239> was
