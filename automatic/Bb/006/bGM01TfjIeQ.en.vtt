and some of them have wood but these

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.420 
and some of them have wood but these
things<00:00:51.750> are<00:00:51.960> reinforced<00:00:52.649> with<00:00:52.769> those<00:00:52.980> slats

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
things are reinforced with those slats

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.709 
things are reinforced with those slats
with<00:00:54.420> the<00:00:54.570> metal<00:00:55.190> rivets<00:00:56.190> paint<00:00:57.090> there's<00:00:57.629> a

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
with the metal rivets paint there's a

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.990 
with the metal rivets paint there's a
lot<00:00:58.109> of<00:00:58.289> material<00:00:58.829> that<00:00:59.250> it<00:00:59.340> takes<00:00:59.550> to<00:00:59.730> build<00:00:59.879> a

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
lot of material that it takes to build a

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.110 
lot of material that it takes to build a
trunk<00:01:00.710> which<00:01:01.710> is<00:01:01.859> why<00:01:02.039> you<00:01:02.100> haven't<00:01:02.699> seen<00:01:02.940> any

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
trunk which is why you haven't seen any

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.550 
trunk which is why you haven't seen any
reproduction<00:01:03.839> ones<00:01:04.230> like<00:01:04.949> that<00:01:05.250> from<00:01:05.880> China

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:06.560 
reproduction ones like that from China

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:09.830 
reproduction ones like that from China
just<00:01:07.560> the<00:01:07.740> components<00:01:08.490> alone<00:01:08.880> would<00:01:09.810> be

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
just the components alone would be

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.060 
just the components alone would be
expensive

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
expensive

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.340 
expensive
now<00:01:11.190> remember<00:01:11.580> people<00:01:11.940> moved<00:01:12.270> used<00:01:12.810> to<00:01:12.900> travel

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
now remember people moved used to travel

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:14.690 
now remember people moved used to travel
with<00:01:13.380> these<00:01:13.620> trunks<00:01:14.040> all<00:01:14.280> right

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
with these trunks all right

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.060 
with these trunks all right
so<00:01:15.300> that's<00:01:15.450> when<00:01:15.630> Porter's<00:01:16.079> you<00:01:16.590> know<00:01:16.890> we're

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
so that's when Porter's you know we're

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.149 
so that's when Porter's you know we're
busy<00:01:17.460> I<00:01:17.750> mean<00:01:18.750> imagine<00:01:19.020> picking<00:01:19.470> these<00:01:19.710> trunks

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
busy I mean imagine picking these trunks

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.730 
busy I mean imagine picking these trunks
up<00:01:20.310> plus<00:01:20.670> you<00:01:21.659> got<00:01:21.840> to<00:01:21.869> make<00:01:22.079> the<00:01:22.259> handles

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
up plus you got to make the handles

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.880 
up plus you got to make the handles
which<00:01:23.220> are<00:01:23.460> like<00:01:23.820> two<00:01:24.210> belts<00:01:24.600> put<00:01:25.229> together<00:01:25.439> in

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
which are like two belts put together in

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.819 
which are like two belts put together in
leather<00:01:26.210> they've<00:01:27.210> got<00:01:27.450> to<00:01:27.570> be<00:01:27.689> riveted<00:01:28.380> all

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
leather they've got to be riveted all

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:30.859 
leather they've got to be riveted all
the<00:01:29.009> way<00:01:29.159> through<00:01:29.490> to<00:01:29.729> support<00:01:30.180> the<00:01:30.390> weight<00:01:30.630> of

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
the way through to support the weight of

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:34.609 
the way through to support the weight of
the<00:01:31.470> trunk<00:01:31.799> itself<00:01:32.780> so<00:01:33.780> what<00:01:33.960> I<00:01:33.990> generally<00:01:34.259> do

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
the trunk itself so what I generally do

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.620 
the trunk itself so what I generally do
instead<00:01:35.070> of<00:01:35.159> buying<00:01:35.340> the<00:01:35.520> leather<00:01:35.729> I'm<00:01:36.390> gonna

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
instead of buying the leather I'm gonna

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.710 
instead of buying the leather I'm gonna
sell<00:01:36.810> nation<00:01:37.079> army<00:01:37.229> a<00:01:37.380> buy<00:01:37.590> old<00:01:37.740> leather<00:01:38.009> belts

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
one belt and you fold it in half and cut

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.499 
one belt and you fold it in half and cut
it<00:01:46.320> it's<00:01:47.159> enough<00:01:47.490> to<00:01:47.610> make<00:01:47.640> to<00:01:47.939> handle<00:01:48.299> all<00:01:48.420> the

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
it it's enough to make to handle all the

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:52.270 
it it's enough to make to handle all the
leftovers<00:01:49.170> into<00:01:49.710> making<00:01:49.890> these<00:01:50.159> handles<00:01:50.729> now

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:52.280 
leftovers into making these handles now

00:01:52.280 --> 00:02:03.139 
leftovers into making these handles now
when<00:01:53.280> you<00:01:53.719> go<00:01:54.719> in<00:01:54.899> here<00:02:01.820> usually<00:02:02.820> don't<00:02:02.969> see

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
when you go in here usually don't see

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:06.350 
when you go in here usually don't see
the<00:02:03.270> inside<00:02:03.659> now<00:02:04.649> but<00:02:05.549> if<00:02:05.640> you<00:02:05.759> look<00:02:06.030> at<00:02:06.210> the

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
the inside now but if you look at the

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:10.249 
the inside now but if you look at the
handle<00:02:06.840> here<00:02:07.170> it's<00:02:07.829> not<00:02:08.130> done<00:02:08.550> right<00:02:08.580> see<00:02:09.300> the

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
handle here it's not done right see the

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:13.700 
handle here it's not done right see the
rivets<00:02:10.710> don't<00:02:11.160> go<00:02:11.370> all<00:02:11.550> the<00:02:11.580> way<00:02:11.700> through<00:02:12.710> so

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
rivets don't go all the way through so

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:15.770 
rivets don't go all the way through so
when<00:02:13.890> we<00:02:14.070> do<00:02:14.280> them<00:02:14.430> I<00:02:14.610> came<00:02:15.060> up<00:02:15.210> with<00:02:15.240> a<00:02:15.420> new<00:02:15.600> way

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
when we do them I came up with a new way

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.170 
when we do them I came up with a new way
you<00:02:16.680> ever<00:02:16.860> see<00:02:17.100> a<00:02:17.130> screwed<00:02:17.580> it<00:02:17.730> goes<00:02:17.880> into<00:02:18.060> a

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
you ever see a screwed it goes into a

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.710 
you ever see a screwed it goes into a
screw

screw

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.839 
screw
yes<00:02:19.200> Chicago<00:02:19.830> screw<00:02:20.099> or<00:02:20.280> something<00:02:20.459> I<00:02:20.640> saw

00:02:20.839 --> 00:02:20.849 
yes Chicago screw or something I saw

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:22.660 
like they're usually aluminum yeah

like they're usually aluminum yeah
well<00:02:23.140> that<00:02:23.590> is<00:02:23.800> the<00:02:23.950> best<00:02:24.160> screw<00:02:24.670> because<00:02:25.390> it's

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.140 
well that is the best screw because it's

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:28.830 
well that is the best screw because it's
got<00:02:26.380> a<00:02:26.410> flat<00:02:26.770> head<00:02:27.040> put<00:02:27.280> them<00:02:27.460> together<00:02:27.840> they

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 
got a flat head put them together they

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:30.960 
got a flat head put them together they
go<00:02:29.080> perfect<00:02:29.740> and<00:02:29.920> they<00:02:30.160> don't<00:02:30.400> stick<00:02:30.820> out

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:30.970 
go perfect and they don't stick out

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:33.600 
go perfect and they don't stick out
because<00:02:31.480> if<00:02:31.660> they<00:02:31.870> stuck<00:02:32.230> out<00:02:32.410> you<00:02:33.370> won't<00:02:33.460> be

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:33.610 
because if they stuck out you won't be

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:35.730 
because if they stuck out you won't be
able<00:02:33.730> to<00:02:33.820> get<00:02:33.970> the<00:02:34.060> tray<00:02:34.270> in<00:02:34.420> there

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:35.740 
able to get the tray in there

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:38.940 
able to get the tray in there
oh<00:02:35.770> that's<00:02:36.190> war<00:02:36.700> you<00:02:37.150> cut<00:02:37.420> your<00:02:37.540> hand<00:02:37.780> yeah

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:38.950 
oh that's war you cut your hand yeah

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:42.840 
oh that's war you cut your hand yeah
so<00:02:40.230> now<00:02:41.230> case<00:02:42.160> in<00:02:42.400> point

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:42.850 
so now case in point

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:44.940 
so now case in point
see<00:02:42.970> the<00:02:43.150> hinges<00:02:43.660> they<00:02:44.230> put<00:02:44.470> them<00:02:44.560> all<00:02:44.710> the<00:02:44.740> way

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950 
see the hinges they put them all the way

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:48.420 
see the hinges they put them all the way
through<00:02:45.210> with<00:02:46.210> the<00:02:46.360> rivet<00:02:46.690> see<00:02:47.100> so<00:02:48.100> that<00:02:48.250> was

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:48.430 
through with the rivet see so that was

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:52.530 
through with the rivet see so that was
actually<00:02:48.640> a<00:02:49.210> a<00:02:49.780> rivet<00:02:50.410> and<00:02:51.120> then<00:02:52.120> they<00:02:52.300> put<00:02:52.510> a

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:52.540 
actually a a rivet and then they put a

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:56.130 
actually a a rivet and then they put a
washer<00:02:53.140> then<00:02:53.740> they<00:02:54.190> cut<00:02:54.700> it<00:02:54.880> heated<00:02:55.780> it<00:02:55.930> and

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:56.140 
washer then they cut it heated it and

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:01.350 
washer then they cut it heated it and
hammered<00:02:56.860> it<00:02:57.010> oh<00:02:57.720> come<00:02:58.720> out<00:02:59.910> almost<00:03:00.910> like<00:03:01.090> a

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:01.360 
hammered it oh come out almost like a

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:04.740 
hammered it oh come out almost like a
like<00:03:01.930> a<00:03:01.960> cotton<00:03:02.470> dress<00:03:03.210> now<00:03:04.210> these<00:03:04.570> are

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:04.750 
like a cotton dress now these are

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:07.440 
like a cotton dress now these are
usually<00:03:04.930> brass<00:03:05.410> plated<00:03:05.950> steel<00:03:06.280> they<00:03:07.030> they

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:07.450 
usually brass plated steel they they

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:09.060 
usually brass plated steel they they
didn't<00:03:07.720> use<00:03:07.870> a<00:03:07.900> lot<00:03:08.050> of<00:03:08.200> brass<00:03:08.590> on<00:03:08.890> these

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:09.070 
didn't use a lot of brass on these

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:11.490 
didn't use a lot of brass on these
because<00:03:09.310> it<00:03:09.430> was<00:03:09.580> expensive<00:03:10.030> so<00:03:10.500> everything

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:11.500 
because it was expensive so everything

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:14.610 
because it was expensive so everything
was<00:03:12.070> brass<00:03:12.550> plated<00:03:13.540> over<00:03:13.660> steel<00:03:14.230> because

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:14.620 
was brass plated over steel because

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:18.750 
was brass plated over steel because
brass<00:03:14.860> don't<00:03:15.100> last<00:03:15.660> so<00:03:16.770> you've<00:03:17.770> got<00:03:17.980> all<00:03:18.220> these

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:18.760 
brass don't last so you've got all these

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:21.510 
brass don't last so you've got all these
different<00:03:18.820> things<00:03:19.860> then<00:03:20.860> you've<00:03:21.070> got<00:03:21.280> this

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:21.520 
different things then you've got this

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:25.560 
different things then you've got this
strip<00:03:21.880> of<00:03:21.910> tin<00:03:22.750> down<00:03:23.470> the<00:03:23.770> center<00:03:24.330> which<00:03:25.330> was

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:25.570 
strip of tin down the center which was

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:29.450 
strip of tin down the center which was
another<00:03:26.760> extra<00:03:27.760> piece<00:03:28.000> of<00:03:28.270> reinforcement

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:29.460 
another extra piece of reinforcement

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:32.580 
another extra piece of reinforcement
because<00:03:30.460> this<00:03:30.940> is<00:03:31.150> where<00:03:31.360> your<00:03:31.570> lock<00:03:31.810> system

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:32.590 
because this is where your lock system

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:35.610 
because this is where your lock system
was<00:03:32.770> so<00:03:33.070> they<00:03:33.760> ran<00:03:34.270> the<00:03:34.510> Tinnell<00:03:34.960> and<00:03:35.320> and<00:03:35.530> not

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:35.620 
was so they ran the Tinnell and and not

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:37.890 
was so they ran the Tinnell and and not
all<00:03:35.800> of<00:03:35.830> them<00:03:36.040> had<00:03:36.430> this<00:03:36.760> this<00:03:37.090> was<00:03:37.300> more<00:03:37.570> for

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:37.900 
all of them had this this was more for

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:41.910 
all of them had this this was more for
show<00:03:38.260> than<00:03:39.190> for<00:03:39.850> strength<00:03:40.500> so<00:03:41.500> you've<00:03:41.680> got<00:03:41.890> all

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:41.920 
show than for strength so you've got all

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:46.110 
show than for strength so you've got all
your<00:03:42.280> tin<00:03:42.610> here<00:03:43.530> so<00:03:44.530> they<00:03:45.490> would<00:03:45.700> just<00:03:45.910> take

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:46.120 
your tin here so they would just take

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:51.180 
your tin here so they would just take
tin<00:03:46.900> stock<00:03:47.940> cut<00:03:48.940> it<00:03:49.120> to<00:03:49.660> the<00:03:49.690> size<00:03:50.020> and<00:03:50.440> it's

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:51.190 
tin stock cut it to the size and it's

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:53.160 
tin stock cut it to the size and it's
and<00:03:51.430> it<00:03:51.550> goes<00:03:51.730> underneath<00:03:52.240> the<00:03:52.390> slats<00:03:52.870> too

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:53.170 
and it goes underneath the slats too

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:55.410 
and it goes underneath the slats too
right<00:03:53.800> and<00:03:54.160> then<00:03:54.459> they<00:03:54.610> would<00:03:54.790> have<00:03:54.970> a<00:03:55.000> jig

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:55.420 
right and then they would have a jig

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:57.360 
right and then they would have a jig
where<00:03:55.630> they<00:03:55.720> would<00:03:55.870> just<00:03:55.900> bend<00:03:56.290> it<00:03:56.470> you<00:03:57.280> know

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:57.370 
where they would just bend it you know

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:00.930 
where they would just bend it you know
you<00:03:57.490> would<00:03:57.610> know<00:03:57.700> with<00:03:57.850> a<00:03:57.880> piece<00:03:58.090> of<00:03:58.270> steel<00:03:59.940> in

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:00.940 
you would know with a piece of steel in

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:02.640 
you would know with a piece of steel in
the<00:04:01.090> wood<00:04:01.270> in<00:04:01.420> half<00:04:01.600> out<00:04:01.900> so<00:04:02.140> you<00:04:02.230> didn't<00:04:02.470> see

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:02.650 
the wood in half out so you didn't see

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:05.010 
the wood in half out so you didn't see
them<00:04:02.760> so<00:04:03.760> that<00:04:03.940> when<00:04:04.090> they<00:04:04.240> stacked<00:04:04.660> the

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:05.020 
them so that when they stacked the

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:09.630 
them so that when they stacked the
trunks<00:04:05.709> in<00:04:05.860> a<00:04:06.070> boat<00:04:07.290> the<00:04:08.290> wheel<00:04:08.560> would<00:04:09.100> fit<00:04:09.370> in

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:09.640 
trunks in a boat the wheel would fit in

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:14.280 
trunks in a boat the wheel would fit in
here<00:04:10.000> and<00:04:10.420> they<00:04:11.290> wouldn't<00:04:11.530> roll<00:04:11.680> off<00:04:13.140> so<00:04:14.140> they

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:14.290 
here and they wouldn't roll off so they

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:16.320 
here and they wouldn't roll off so they
had<00:04:14.530> to<00:04:14.709> be<00:04:14.890> made<00:04:15.100> where<00:04:15.370> they<00:04:15.430> were<00:04:15.520> stackable

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:16.330 
had to be made where they were stackable

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:20.820 
had to be made where they were stackable
also<00:04:18.299> without<00:04:19.299> rolling<00:04:19.690> around<00:04:19.750> exactly<00:04:20.680> the

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:20.830 
also without rolling around exactly the

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:22.650 
also without rolling around exactly the
same<00:04:21.100> thing<00:04:21.370> right<00:04:21.580> there<00:04:21.880> right<00:04:22.180> absolutely

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:22.660 
same thing right there right absolutely

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:26.310 
same thing right there right absolutely

now look at this wood superior look at
this<00:04:26.470> heavy<00:04:26.680> gauge<00:04:27.010> this<00:04:27.670> is<00:04:27.910> twice<00:04:28.180> as<00:04:28.240> thick

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:28.510 
this heavy gauge this is twice as thick

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:30.869 
this heavy gauge this is twice as thick
as<00:04:29.020> this

00:04:30.869 --> 00:04:30.879 
as this

00:04:30.879 --> 00:04:32.339 
as this
