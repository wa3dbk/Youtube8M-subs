00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:42.060 
really not sure if it takes off

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:44.660 
really not sure if it takes off
waterproof<00:03:42.569> mascara<00:03:42.780> because<00:03:43.769> I<00:03:44.010> don't<00:03:44.430> wear

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:44.670 
waterproof mascara because I don't wear

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:46.699 
waterproof mascara because I don't wear
it<00:03:44.849> but<00:03:45.209> you<00:03:45.450> can<00:03:45.629> always<00:03:45.780> try<00:03:46.140> it<00:03:46.230> out<00:03:46.409> I

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:46.709 
it but you can always try it out I

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:51.440 
it but you can always try it out I
believe<00:03:47.430> this<00:03:47.579> is<00:03:47.640> under<00:03:48.090> five<00:03:48.329> dollars<00:03:48.959> and<00:03:50.450> I

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:51.450 
believe this is under five dollars and I

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:53.780 
believe this is under five dollars and I
think<00:03:51.930> the<00:03:52.319> refills<00:03:52.950> are<00:03:53.129> actually<00:03:53.519> even

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:53.790 
think the refills are actually even

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:56.059 
think the refills are actually even
cheaper<00:03:54.209> so<00:03:54.510> this<00:03:55.290> is<00:03:55.500> actually<00:03:55.650> something

00:03:56.059 --> 00:03:56.069 
cheaper so this is actually something

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:57.920 
cheaper so this is actually something
that<00:03:56.340> you<00:03:56.579> might<00:03:56.760> want<00:03:56.969> to<00:03:57.060> go<00:03:57.180> check<00:03:57.209> out<00:03:57.599> the
