be so unreasonable to make that's

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
because I never competed in a match at

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:49.860 
got to do it it takes the win and if

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:51.400 
got to do it it takes the win and if
that<00:02:50.010> means<00:02:50.220> bending<00:02:50.610> the<00:02:50.730> rules<00:02:50.910> of<00:02:51.120> bet
