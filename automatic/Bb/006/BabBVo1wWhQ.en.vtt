foots actually going to slide across the
pedal<00:01:04.760> throughout<00:01:05.210> the<00:01:05.330> course<00:01:05.540> of<00:01:05.690> the<00:01:05.780> two

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:05.930 
pedal throughout the course of the two

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:13.000 
pedal throughout the course of the two
hits<00:01:06.170> it's<00:01:06.410> going<00:01:06.560> to<00:01:06.620> sound<00:01:06.680> like<00:01:06.860> this<00:01:12.010> now

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:13.010 
hits it's going to sound like this now

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:14.650 
hits it's going to sound like this now
to<00:01:13.400> take<00:01:13.610> that<00:01:13.760> really<00:01:13.910> slow<00:01:14.270> you're<00:01:14.480> just

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:14.660 
to take that really slow you're just

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:16.330 
to take that really slow you're just
making<00:01:14.960> sort<00:01:15.200> of<00:01:15.260> this<00:01:15.380> rocking<00:01:16.010> motion

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:16.340 
making sort of this rocking motion

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:19.000 
making sort of this rocking motion
you're<00:01:16.490> hitting<00:01:16.790> down<00:01:17.390> once<00:01:17.750> and<00:01:18.380> then<00:01:18.890> you're

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:19.010 
you're hitting down once and then you're

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:21.220 
you're hitting down once and then you're
doing<00:01:19.190> another<00:01:19.370> quick<00:01:19.670> hit<00:01:20.050> but<00:01:21.050> you're<00:01:21.170> not

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:21.230 
doing another quick hit but you're not

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:23.350 
doing another quick hit but you're not
actually<00:01:21.470> taking<00:01:21.740> your<00:01:22.010> foot<00:01:22.760> off<00:01:22.970> the<00:01:23.030> pedal

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:23.360 
actually taking your foot off the pedal

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:25.660 
actually taking your foot off the pedal
so<00:01:24.320> you're<00:01:24.440> not<00:01:24.500> doing<00:01:24.740> two<00:01:24.890> separate<00:01:25.310> strikes

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:25.670 
so you're not doing two separate strikes

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:28.390 
so you're not doing two separate strikes
that<00:01:25.970> would<00:01:26.120> slow<00:01:26.360> you<00:01:26.420> down<00:01:27.190> you're<00:01:28.190> just

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:28.400 
that would slow you down you're just

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:31.990 
that would slow you down you're just
kind<00:01:28.610> of<00:01:29.860> really<00:01:30.860> rocking<00:01:31.550> your<00:01:31.640> foot<00:01:31.880> over

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:32.000 
kind of really rocking your foot over

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.300 
kind of really rocking your foot over
that<00:01:32.240> it'll<00:01:32.840> take<00:01:32.870> a<00:01:33.050> while<00:01:33.410> to<00:01:33.800> really<00:01:34.010> get

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:34.310 
that it'll take a while to really get

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:36.280 
that it'll take a while to really get
this<00:01:34.490> down<00:01:34.700> now<00:01:35.390> let<00:01:35.540> me<00:01:35.630> show<00:01:35.810> you<00:01:35.870> what<00:01:36.170> it

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:36.290 
this down now let me show you what it

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:38.350 
this down now let me show you what it
sounds<00:01:36.530> like<00:01:36.590> in<00:01:36.800> the<00:01:36.860> context<00:01:37.490> of<00:01:37.610> a<00:01:38.120> drum

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:38.360 
sounds like in the context of a drum

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:40.720 
sounds like in the context of a drum
beat<00:01:38.510> and<00:01:38.690> once<00:01:39.290> you<00:01:39.410> get<00:01:39.530> those<00:01:39.680> those<00:01:40.220> double

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:40.730 
beat and once you get those those double

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:42.520 
beat and once you get those those double
hits<00:01:41.000> down<00:01:41.240> how<00:01:41.510> you<00:01:41.540> can<00:01:41.870> start<00:01:42.050> working<00:01:42.410> on

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:42.530 
hits down how you can start working on

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:44.530 
hits down how you can start working on
this<00:01:42.650> some<00:01:42.830> exercises<00:01:43.550> you're<00:01:44.150> going<00:01:44.180> to<00:01:44.330> play

slower<00:01:53.360> as<00:01:53.660> we<00:01:54.050> speed<00:01:54.350> it<00:01:54.380> up<00:01:54.530> we'll<00:01:54.680> have<00:01:54.830> to

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:55.040 
slower as we speed it up we'll have to

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:56.470 
slower as we speed it up we'll have to
go<00:01:55.190> to<00:01:55.250> the<00:01:55.400> slide<00:01:55.610> technique<00:01:55.820> watch<00:01:56.150> how<00:01:56.330> my

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:56.480 
go to the slide technique watch how my

00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:02.560 
go to the slide technique watch how my
foot<00:01:56.690> changes<00:01:56.960> its<00:01:57.260> position

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:02.570 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:10.369 

okay<00:02:03.570> so<00:02:04.079> high-hat<00:02:08.929> another<00:02:09.929> way<00:02:10.110> you<00:02:10.170> can

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
okay so high-hat another way you can

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:12.020 
okay so high-hat another way you can
another<00:02:10.649> exercise<00:02:11.160> you<00:02:11.430> can<00:02:11.550> put<00:02:11.730> that<00:02:11.819> into

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
another exercise you can put that into

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.970 
another exercise you can put that into
in<00:02:12.420> the<00:02:12.840> context<00:02:13.319> of<00:02:13.379> a<00:02:13.470> beat<00:02:13.650> would<00:02:13.860> be

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
in the context of a beat would be

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:28.900 
in the context of a beat would be
something<00:02:14.190> like<00:02:14.310> this

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:28.910 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:31.580 

all<00:02:29.910> right<00:02:30.120> work<00:02:30.450> on<00:02:30.660> that<00:02:30.840> and<00:02:30.989> have<00:02:31.200> fun<00:02:31.260> with

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
all right work on that and have fun with

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:33.589 
all right work on that and have fun with
it<00:02:31.650> I'd<00:02:32.190> like<00:02:32.370> to<00:02:32.519> encourage<00:02:32.910> you<00:02:33.120> to<00:02:33.299> take

00:02:33.589 --> 00:02:33.599 
it I'd like to encourage you to take

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:35.780 
it I'd like to encourage you to take
these<00:02:33.810> exercises<00:02:34.620> that<00:02:34.739> we<00:02:34.829> looked<00:02:35.040> at<00:02:35.190> for

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
these exercises that we looked at for

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:37.610 
these exercises that we looked at for
the<00:02:35.849> double<00:02:36.150> kick<00:02:36.299> pedal<00:02:36.480> and<00:02:36.780> implement<00:02:37.500> them

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
the double kick pedal and implement them

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:39.530 
the double kick pedal and implement them
every<00:02:37.950> day<00:02:38.099> just<00:02:38.549> a<00:02:38.730> little<00:02:39.060> bit<00:02:39.239> with

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
every day just a little bit with

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.750 
every day just a little bit with
consistency<00:02:40.200> goes<00:02:40.560> a<00:02:40.590> long<00:02:40.860> way<00:02:41.130> and<00:02:41.370> is<00:02:41.489> much

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
consistency goes a long way and is much

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.880 
consistency goes a long way and is much
better<00:02:42.000> than<00:02:42.569> just<00:02:42.780> taking<00:02:43.049> one<00:02:43.440> day<00:02:43.650> and

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
better than just taking one day and

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:45.229 
better than just taking one day and
doing<00:02:44.130> like<00:02:44.280> three<00:02:44.549> or<00:02:44.640> four<00:02:44.700> hours<00:02:45.120> of

00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:45.239 
doing like three or four hours of

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:47.300 
doing like three or four hours of
practice<00:02:45.660> so<00:02:46.170> keep<00:02:46.440> at<00:02:46.620> it<00:02:46.650> and<00:02:46.920> you'll<00:02:47.069> see

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
practice so keep at it and you'll see

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:49.430 
practice so keep at it and you'll see
your<00:02:47.489> speed<00:02:47.880> and<00:02:48.150> your<00:02:48.630> control<00:02:49.049> and<00:02:49.319> your

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
your speed and your control and your

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:53.750 
your speed and your control and your
technique<00:02:49.829> and<00:02:50.069> feel<00:02:50.329> increasing<00:02:51.329> over<00:02:51.720> time
