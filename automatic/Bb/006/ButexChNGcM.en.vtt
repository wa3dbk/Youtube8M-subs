brilliantly
it<00:00:29.640> fires<00:00:30.060> three<00:00:31.050> arrows<00:00:31.470> a<00:00:31.619> second<00:00:32.070> so<00:00:32.790> that's

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
it fires three arrows a second so that's

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.490 
it fires three arrows a second so that's
the<00:00:33.149> equivalent<00:00:33.540> of<00:00:33.600> like<00:00:33.750> three<00:00:34.020> stacks<00:00:34.350> a

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
the equivalent of like three stacks a

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.979 
the equivalent of like three stacks a
minute<00:00:34.770> or<00:00:34.890> something<00:00:35.420> like<00:00:36.420> just<00:00:36.660> over<00:00:36.899> that

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
minute or something like just over that

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.170 
minute or something like just over that

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
that way and one that way that's gonna

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:51.139 
that way and one that way that's gonna
be<00:01:47.880> your<00:01:48.000> clock<00:01:48.299> and<00:01:48.619> just<00:01:49.619> stick<00:01:49.860> redstone<00:01:50.369> on

sticky<00:02:01.860> piston<00:02:02.189> facing<00:02:02.340> upwards<00:02:03.079> stick<00:02:04.079> a

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
sticky piston facing upwards stick a

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.139 
sticky piston facing upwards stick a
nice<00:02:04.799> long<00:02:05.040> green<00:02:05.310> wall<00:02:05.520> or<00:02:05.700> whatever<00:02:05.939> block

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
you using on top of that and then two

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.760 
you using on top of that and then two
repeaters<00:02:09.390> are<00:02:09.750> facing<00:02:10.170> this<00:02:10.319> way

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
repeaters are facing this way

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.710 
repeaters are facing this way
none<00:02:11.730> of<00:02:11.760> the<00:02:11.879> repeaters<00:02:12.150> and<00:02:12.360> this<00:02:12.480> needs<00:02:12.660> to

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
none of the repeaters and this needs to

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:13.730 
none of the repeaters and this needs to
be<00:02:12.780> set<00:02:13.080> 20<00:02:13.290> ticks

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
be set 20 ticks

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.070 
be set 20 ticks
so<00:02:13.890> don't<00:02:14.610> worry<00:02:14.700> about<00:02:14.820> that<00:02:14.970> what<00:02:15.870> this<00:02:15.960> is

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
so don't worry about that what this is

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:17.480 
so don't worry about that what this is
gonna<00:02:16.200> do<00:02:16.410> is<00:02:16.500> just<00:02:16.710> like<00:02:16.890> a<00:02:16.920> relay<00:02:17.280> for<00:02:17.310> the

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:17.490 
gonna do is just like a relay for the

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:19.790 
gonna do is just like a relay for the
button<00:02:17.760> kind<00:02:17.970> of<00:02:18.090> like<00:02:18.180> a<00:02:18.210> T<00:02:18.390> flip-flop<00:02:18.800> just

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
button kind of like a T flip-flop just

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:22.280 
button kind of like a T flip-flop just
like<00:02:20.010> in<00:02:20.250> there<00:02:20.790> now<00:02:21.240> for<00:02:21.540> the<00:02:21.600> pink<00:02:21.810> wool<00:02:21.990> part
