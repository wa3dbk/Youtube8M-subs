00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.799
 the human diet has changed more in the 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:07.140
 last 50 years than in the last 10 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:09.090
 thousand as a result today we are 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:10.950
 suffering from diseases that never before 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.719
 we had suffered especially the 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.000
 new generations with the growing 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:17.130
 industrialization new seeds and 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.990
 then they were created food in 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.689
 laboratories using products 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.550
 chemicals and artificial ingredients that 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.590
 mimic the taste and texture of 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:32.430
 food but that actually of 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:34.980
 food have nothing when 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.960
 we consume those foods of ours 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:40.290
 bodies do not know what to do with them 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:42.030
 after all for thousands of years the 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.160
 human being evolved based on 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.590
 natural foods that either cultivate 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.600
 A healthy mouth is why when inf 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:51.210
 we are to our system with these 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:54.329
 new chemical substances not only 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:56.760
 we get fat unless we get sick so 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:58.530
 in this video we are going to see 7 reasons for 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.989
 health to stop consuming products 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.910
 processed and I'll also give you 10 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:05.640
 tips to help you reduce your 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.810
 Consumption 7 health reasons to stop 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.930
 consume food 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.970
 to 21 food manufacturers spend 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.829
 huge amounts of resources in the 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.780
 engineering products that are so 

00:01:13.829 --> 00:01:17.369
 incredibly rewarding for the 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.409
 brain that affects our mechanism 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:23.610
 innate satiety which makes us 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:25.860
 eat more and more and more 21 can become 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.600
 addicted to processed foods the 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.890
 super rewarding character of the 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.840
 junk foods that usually 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.929
 they contain a combination of what 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:36.179
 they call the evil trinity sugar oil 

00:01:33.929 --> 00:01:37.920
 and salt can affect the biochemistry of 

00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:40.440
 brain and lead to addiction and 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.119
 loss of portion control 3 the 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:44.130
 lack of nutrients from these pseudo 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:45.659
 food makes us feel weak and 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.000
 hungry because of its structure 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:50.220
 we can eat more in less time and 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.200
 burn less energy by digesting the 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.899
 what we would take and burn if 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.159
 we ate real foods 4 so 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:58.709
 general processed foods 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:00.869
 contain high levels of sugar and 

00:01:58.709 --> 00:02:02.939
 high fructose corn syrup the 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:04.740
 Sugar is the number one enemy of 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:06.599
 our health can have serious 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:09.509
 adverse effects on metabolism and 

00:02:06.599 --> 00:02:11.310
 cause obesity and diabetes 5 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:13.090
 Processed foods are high in 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:14.830
 simple carbohydrates 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:17.379
 and carbohydrates in food 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:19.569
 processed are therefore refined low 

00:02:17.379 --> 00:02:21.519
 in nutrients and low in fiber what 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:24.640
 leads to rapid increases in levels 

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:27.099
 of blood sugar and insulin 6 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:29.140
 processed foods are high in 

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:31.060
 unhealthy fats usually 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:32.830
 they contain cheap refined fats from 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:35.349
 seeds or vegetables like oil 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:37.660
 soybeans that are often hydrogenated what 

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:39.220
 that makes trans fats these 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:42.010
 thanks they contain excessive amounts 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:43.930
 of omega 6 fatty acids that increase the 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:46.390
 oxidation and inflammation in the body 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:48.430
 and finally 7 foods highly 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:50.380
 processed are loaded with products 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:52.690
 artificial chemicals including 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:54.459
 coloring texturing flavorings and 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:56.799
 preservatives that increase toxicity 

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:58.239
 of our bodies 10 tips for 

00:02:56.799 --> 00:03:00.610
 reduce food intake 

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:03.370
 processed 1 if you can not do it 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:05.950
 easily in your kitchen do not eat it if 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:08.739
 It is made in a plant and not in a 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:10.870
 plant do not eat it and if the animal was not 

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:12.050
 fed with your natural diet not what 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:14.900
 commas 

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:17.030
 as the real thing eats chicken instead of 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:19.250
 chicken nuggets fish instead of 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:20.450
 fish sticks strawberries instead of 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:22.370
 Strawberry jam 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:24.140
 etcetera 3 if the label has 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:26.240
 ingredients that you can not pronounce not 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:28.070
 buy it how many more ingredients 

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:30.530
 processed is very likely to be 

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:32.210
 loaded with empty calories sodium sugar 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:35.030
 artificial ingredients and products 

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:38.120
 chemicals 4 do not consume refined grains 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:40.910
 that is white rice white bread flour 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:42.950
 white pastry cereals and so on 

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:44.810
 whole grains contain the bran and 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:46.580
 the germ of the grain they contain 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:48.620
 valuable nutrients and fiber 

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:50.600
 instead the refined grains just 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:52.730
 contain the endosperm and go through a 

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:54.830
 chemical bleaching process that not only 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:57.230
 impoverishes their nutrition but also 

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:59.150
 leaves a toxic residue of a substance 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:00.950
 dangerous called 'the healthy ok that has 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:03.170
 been associated with the development of 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:05.270
 Type 2 diabetes consumes whole grains 

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:08.170
 like brown rice or rice 

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:10.940
 Chinese wild to my son buckwheat 

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:13.220
 amaranth and pep you can consume wheat 

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:15.560
 integral if you do not mind the gluten but 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:17.690
 take into account that today wheat 

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:18.889
 it is one of the most genetically 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:20.840
 modified 

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:22.939
 and many autoimmune diseases like 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:25.069
 celiac have been associated with the 

00:04:22.939 --> 00:04:27.259
 5 stay away from the 

00:04:25.069 --> 00:04:28.939
 syrup artificial sweeteners 

00:04:27.259 --> 00:04:31.610
 high fructose corn and syrup 

00:04:28.939 --> 00:04:33.949
 agave aspartame sucralose make your 

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:35.599
 famous saccharin high corn syrup 

00:04:33.949 --> 00:04:37.479
 fructose and agave syrup 

00:04:35.599 --> 00:04:39.979
 all those are artificial sweeteners 

00:04:37.479 --> 00:04:41.719
 some health experts suggest that 

00:04:39.979 --> 00:04:43.580
 the cakes slowly destroys me 

00:04:41.719 --> 00:04:45.560
 neurons and long- term exposure 

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:47.900
 can lead to diseases like 

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:50.150
 Parkinson's Multiple Sclerosis 

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:52.159
 Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and 

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:55.069
 Alzheimer's agave syrup contains 

00:04:52.159 --> 00:04:58.099
 up to 90% fructose the syrup 

00:04:55.069 --> 00:04:59.840
 High fructose corn contains 55% 

00:04:58.099 --> 00:05:01.879
 fructose which is the natural sugar 

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:04.129
 present in fruits is only found 

00:05:01.879 --> 00:05:06.259
 in small quantities the body knows 

00:05:04.129 --> 00:05:07.699
 how to process when you consume quantities 

00:05:06.259 --> 00:05:10.159
 huge as the concentrations 

00:05:07.699 --> 00:05:12.560
 present in these syrups imposes its 

00:05:10.159 --> 00:05:14.839
 colossal discharge to your liver so serious 

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:17.749
 that can cause metabolic syndrome and 

00:05:14.839 --> 00:05:20.150
 type 2 diabetes best stevia test is 

00:05:17.749 --> 00:05:23.029
 lukewarm in English that is a sweet herb 

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:25.280
 or raw coconut sugar that is low and 

00:05:23.029 --> 00:05:28.130
 fructose and above contains minerals 

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:31.010
 and 26 stay away from the oils 

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:32.840
 refined or hydrogenated do not cook me 

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:35.120
 buy products that contain oils 

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:37.130
 vegetable oil soybean oil corn 

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:39.260
 or canola oil vegetable oils 

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:41.169
 They are loaded with the trans fat 

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:43.850
 Trans fats are unsaturated fats 

00:05:41.169 --> 00:05:45.380
 highly toxic and are associated with 

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:48.620
 an increased risk of diseases 

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:51.320
 heart cancer diabetes and obesity 7 no 

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:53.419
 buy low fat or light products 

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:55.310
 without fat as the author points out 

00:05:53.419 --> 00:05:58.160
 journalist and activist michael pollán 

00:05:55.310 --> 00:06:00.530
 We have fattened based on products 

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:02.450
 low-fat products low in 

00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:04.100
 fats are very rich in carbohydrates and 

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:05.930
 the excess of carbohydrates becomes 

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:08.060
 in fats in the liver that elevate 

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:09.080
 triglyceride levels in blood one 

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:11.060
 important risk factor 

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:13.010
 cardiovascular foods that are 

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:14.630
 naturally rich in saturated fats and 

00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:16.729
 cholesterol tend to be highly 

00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:18.500
 nutritious and perfectly healthy 

00:06:16.729 --> 00:06:21.200
 the low- fat products are 

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:23.419
 deprived of these nutrients 8 south 

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:25.040
 of tea in your little market on wheels 

00:06:23.419 --> 00:06:27.680
 there is nothing like buying products 

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:29.479
 cool hands that you trust you not only go 

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:31.130
 to find seasonal products that 

00:06:29.479 --> 00:06:31.580
 is when they are more nutritious but 

00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:33.259
 also in 

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:35.060
 against free fruits and vegetables 

00:06:33.259 --> 00:06:36.289
 pesticides and maybe even products 

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:39.020
 animals that were properly 

00:06:36.289 --> 00:06:40.580
 also fed is also better for 

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:42.710
 our environment consuming 

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:44.449
 locally grown products instead 

00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:46.789
 of supermarket products that 

00:06:44.449 --> 00:06:48.830
 sometimes they travel hundreds of kilometers to 

00:06:46.789 --> 00:06:50.840
 buy these products we contribute to the 

00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:53.629
 fuel consumption energy and 

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:56.930
 packaging that requires transport 

00:06:53.629 --> 00:06:59.389
 preserve and pack these products 9 

00:06:56.930 --> 00:07:01.159
 do not consume soft drinks and drinks 

00:06:59.389 --> 00:07:03.800
 energy some energy measures 

00:07:01.159 --> 00:07:06.199
 labeled as healthy can 

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:08.180
 contain up to 62 grams of sugar per 

00:07:06.199 --> 00:07:10.250
 every 12 ounces to give you an idea 

00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:12.979
 a cocacola of the same size contains 

00:07:10.250 --> 00:07:15.469
 39 grams better add fruit slices 

00:07:12.979 --> 00:07:17.449
 fresh or ginger to your water not only 

00:07:15.469 --> 00:07:19.789
 will lose the toxins but in addition to 

00:07:17.449 --> 00:07:21.800
 hydrate you have really and finally 10 

00:07:19.789 --> 00:07:23.960
 do it yourself 

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:25.669
 you can prepare your own dressing 

00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:27.979
 own cereal your own sauce for 

00:07:25.669 --> 00:07:30.229
 pasta your own yunus and your snacks 

00:07:27.979 --> 00:07:32.930
 not only will they be healthier but 

00:07:30.229 --> 00:07:35.120
 they will be tastier and cost less unless 

00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:37.370
 that will also give you the right to 

00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:41.120
 brag the solutions very well 

00:07:37.370 --> 00:07:43.040
 and eat real food and we can change the 

00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:45.620
 supply of our food to 

00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:47.660
 demand only what we choose and what 

00:07:45.620 --> 00:07:50.540
 best of all is that when you improve
