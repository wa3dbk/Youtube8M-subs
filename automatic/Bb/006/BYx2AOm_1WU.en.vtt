00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:16.869
 the six ice creams is a small step to the 

00:00:14.709 --> 00:00:18.250
 funky give a little spice 

00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:19.990
 when you are in a box 

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:22.540
 so to work this parent in the 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:24.820
 right foot of me tip tip the 

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:25.990
 talent only left foot is first 

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:29.109
 made only the right foot 

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:30.519
 you return to the initial position and 

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:32.080
 you repeat again the step left to 

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:36.040
 do it dozens of times that a 

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:37.660
 good nothing complex buddy boom that level 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:39.610
 there one country after another we 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:41.199
 decorating up 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:43.360
 can you then remember at the level 

00:00:41.199 --> 00:00:44.769
 of the left foot so you clear for 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:47.170
 avoid the talent we had 

00:00:44.769 --> 00:00:49.150
 tilted right so hop did not want 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:51.339
 so that's what makes a shot of me 

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:52.720
 point on heels and idem you redone 

00:00:51.339 --> 00:00:56.140
 the same thing explains left of 

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:58.500
 dozens of times a buddy hop you 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:58.500
 delete 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:04.750
 you have to feel good that you 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:06.400
 have already realized that so you 're 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:09.430
 passed directly both feet in 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:11.650
 same time but first right then 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:15.190
 left still shelled up 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:18.250
 then you rock the left ok ok 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:22.780
 you bring back lake and you redo 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:25.270
 new left right is closed so 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:27.640
 your 2000 tickets tip right and 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:30.910
 then only heel up to happen and 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:34.810
 you come back hockey boom boom but you 

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:36.700
 come back hop hop that one time you 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:39.690
 are comfortable in the you are really 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:39.690
 in the step and you go there 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:51.070
 obviously on the other side it's the same 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:57.369
 thing so the same explanation always 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:58.810
 up heel the foot boom tac that is top up 

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:00.130
 so that wants to do on one side you know 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:05.950
 also do the other side so that's 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:07.570
 the same visual bit weak but good 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:09.819

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:10.869
