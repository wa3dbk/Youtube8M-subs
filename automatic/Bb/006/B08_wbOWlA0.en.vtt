00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.800
Sort the data in a document

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:09.080
Web Intelligence enables us to sort data based on ascending or descending values for a specific column.

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:14.760
If a default sort does not meet our needs, we can also create and apply a custom sort order.

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:20.480
In this example, we will sort the sales revenue in the document to show lowest to highest, and then highest to lowest values. 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:25.000
We will also create a custom sort order to arrange the stores from West to East.

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:35.320
Note that the Sales Revenue values are now arranged from lowest to highest within each section.

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.320
Now we will change the order to sort values from highest to lowest.

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:45.560
The Sales Revenue values are now arranged from highest to lowest within each section.

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:48.640
We can use the same menu to remove existing sorts.

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.240
Now we will create a custom sort order to arrange stores from West to East.

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:02.680
We need to add a new sort for the Store name dimension.

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:10.040
Now we will review the current order of the values for the dimension.

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:14.560
Note that the stores are currently in ascending alphabetic order.

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.720
You can use the arrows to move the store names up and down in the list.

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.760
We will move San Francisco to the top of the list.

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:31.000
The next stores in the West to East order should be Los Angeles and Colorado Springs.

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:39.720
The remainder of the custom sort order has been completed.

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:44.320
We will apply the new sort order and then review the results.

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:53.160
Note that the custom sort order has been applied.

00:01:55.480 --> 00:02:05.120
