 list files this for what it is useful 

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:22.650
 so it's useful for us in a sheet of 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.840
 excel can list us all our 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.960
 documents that are in a 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:31.080
 folder of our computer 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:34.649
 we are going to press list files and in 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:38.820
 this form we are going to examine and we are going 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:42.690
 to choose the folder that we want to list 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:45.690
 your files we are going to choose this from 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:48.090
 tests and we accept 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:52.469
 within the options that we have is 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:55.379
 that we can indicate some extension or 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:56.940
 if we will bring all desmarcamos 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:59.060
 the files that are inside the 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.790
 binder 

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:03.320
 and we mark even your folders are going to 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:05.840
 bring everything contained 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:07.670
 inside the main folder as 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:10.090
 within the subfolders that are 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:13.539
 inside her 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:15.780
 let's do the filter without extension is 

00:01:13.539 --> 00:01:18.690
 say show us all 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.580
 and that includes the subfolders we're going to 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:24.540
 to accept 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:27.500
 and if they are fixed they brought the files of 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:30.110
 the evidence folder 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:32.750
 comes the full path with the name and 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:35.900
 the extension has the name of the file 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:38.090
 and the extension comes in addition to coming 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:41.690
 the size in bytes and the date of 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:46.160
 modification we're going down and 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:48.800
 comes also the files that were 

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:51.670
 within the subfolders in this case 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:54.920
 it was folder let's do another test 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:58.130
 we go again file list 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:00.460
 files we're going to go to the same 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:00.460
 binder 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:06.060
 tests 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:10.410
 let's say we want it to be the 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:13.610
 extension xls x but this time not 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:17.450
 we include subfolders we will accept 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:20.190
 he created us a new file where 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:21.890
 we have the same options as the 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:24.650
 past filter 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:28.730
 the documents included in the folder 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:32.720
 of tests the name of each file the 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:35.410
 extension size in bytes and the date of 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:35.410
