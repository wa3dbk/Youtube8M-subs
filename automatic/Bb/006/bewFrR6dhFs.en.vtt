00:00:13.539 --> 00:00:13.549 
will I pick some scraps of collage

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:18.130 
will I pick some scraps of collage
papers<00:00:14.530> that<00:00:15.530> I<00:00:15.650> have<00:00:15.860> left<00:00:16.219> over<00:00:16.430> here<00:00:17.140> and

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:18.140 
papers that I have left over here and

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:19.420 
papers that I have left over here and
what<00:00:18.290> I'm<00:00:18.410> going<00:00:18.470> to<00:00:18.619> do<00:00:18.860> is<00:00:19.040> I'm<00:00:19.220> going<00:00:19.340> to

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:19.430 
what I'm going to do is I'm going to

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:22.390 
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
tack<00:00:19.790> them<00:00:20.090> down<00:00:20.330> to<00:00:20.720> the<00:00:21.110> polymer<00:00:21.950> surface

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:22.400 
tack them down to the polymer surface

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:26.859 
tack them down to the polymer surface
that's<00:00:22.640> dried<00:00:23.410> so<00:00:24.410> I<00:00:24.859> will<00:00:25.310> just<00:00:25.609> randomly<00:00:26.390> put

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:26.869 
that's dried so I will just randomly put

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:33.660 
that's dried so I will just randomly put
some<00:00:27.140> papers<00:00:27.650> down<00:00:28.060> on<00:00:29.060> each<00:00:29.480> one<00:00:29.779> of<00:00:29.960> these

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:33.670 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:36.700 

I'm<00:00:34.670> eventually<00:00:34.970> going<00:00:35.510> to<00:00:35.629> use<00:00:36.050> acrylic

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:36.710 
I'm eventually going to use acrylic

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:40.030 
I'm eventually going to use acrylic
paint<00:00:37.220> and<00:00:37.519> push<00:00:37.879> this<00:00:38.750> back<00:00:39.140> and<00:00:39.530> actually

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:40.040 
paint and push this back and actually

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:43.720 
paint and push this back and actually
even<00:00:40.340> cover<00:00:40.790> over<00:00:41.239> these<00:00:41.420> papers<00:00:41.989> a<00:00:42.730> practice

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:43.730 
even cover over these papers a practice

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:48.790 
even cover over these papers a practice
that's<00:00:44.860> I'm<00:00:45.860> learning<00:00:46.399> to<00:00:47.329> do<00:00:47.540> and<00:00:47.840> it<00:00:48.469> is<00:00:48.559> hard

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:48.800 
that's I'm learning to do and it is hard

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.940 
that's I'm learning to do and it is hard
to<00:00:48.920> do<00:00:49.219> for<00:00:49.610> a<00:00:49.879> lot<00:00:50.690> of<00:00:50.870> us<00:00:51.020> is<00:00:51.320> to<00:00:51.590> lay<00:00:51.920> down

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:51.950 
to do for a lot of us is to lay down

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:56.590 
to do for a lot of us is to lay down
papers<00:00:52.870> and<00:00:53.870> then<00:00:54.340> push<00:00:55.340> them<00:00:55.610> back<00:00:55.910> or<00:00:56.270> cover

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:56.600 
papers and then push them back or cover

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:04.299 
papers and then push them back or cover
them<00:00:56.870> up<00:01:02.050> alright<00:01:03.050> then<00:01:03.379> I'll<00:01:03.559> be<00:01:03.710> back<00:01:04.009> for

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:04.309 
them up alright then I'll be back for

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:12.330 
them up alright then I'll be back for
that<00:01:04.369> one<00:01:04.729> there<00:01:06.250> tear<00:01:07.690> some<00:01:08.690> paper<00:01:09.050> here

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:12.340 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:25.230 

actually<00:01:14.619> here<00:01:15.619> to<00:01:16.520> the<00:01:16.670> Sun<00:01:17.060> make<00:01:19.180> neck<00:01:20.180> back

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:25.240 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:32.950 

there's<00:01:26.240> a<00:01:26.360> white<00:01:26.630> shapes<00:01:27.020> in<00:01:30.640> and<00:01:31.640> do<00:01:32.479> a<00:01:32.509> hint

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:32.960 
there's a white shapes in and do a hint

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:39.219 
there's a white shapes in and do a hint
of<00:01:33.729> this<00:01:34.729> here<00:01:35.500> okay<00:01:37.540> now<00:01:38.540> again<00:01:38.659> these<00:01:39.020> are

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:39.229 
of this here okay now again these are

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:43.120 
of this here okay now again these are
exercises<00:01:40.450> so<00:01:41.450> it<00:01:41.659> really<00:01:41.990> doesn't<00:01:42.409> matter

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:43.130 
exercises so it really doesn't matter

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:47.859 
exercises so it really doesn't matter
too<00:01:43.520> much<00:01:43.549> about<00:01:44.030> placement<00:01:44.540> as<00:01:46.750> what<00:01:47.750> I'm

00:01:47.859 --> 00:01:47.869 
too much about placement as what I'm

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:49.090 
too much about placement as what I'm
going<00:01:48.049> to<00:01:48.079> do<00:01:48.259> I'm<00:01:48.409> just<00:01:48.439> going<00:01:48.770> to<00:01:48.829> practice

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:49.100 
going to do I'm just going to practice

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:59.109 
going to do I'm just going to practice
on<00:01:49.610> here<00:01:55.299> we've<00:01:56.299> got<00:01:56.540> it<00:01:56.720> going<00:01:57.850> vertical<00:01:58.850> and

00:01:59.109 --> 00:01:59.119 
on here we've got it going vertical and

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:22.600 
on here we've got it going vertical and
got<00:01:59.479> a<00:01:59.509> horizontal

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:22.610 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:32.050 

I<00:02:25.990> never<00:02:26.990> know<00:02:27.370> how<00:02:28.370> the<00:02:28.430> papers<00:02:30.730> need<00:02:31.730> to<00:02:31.910> be

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:32.060 
I never know how the papers need to be

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:37.510 
I never know how the papers need to be
laid<00:02:32.300> out<00:02:32.350> until<00:02:33.350> I<00:02:33.740> place<00:02:34.700> them<00:02:36.100> and<00:02:37.100> I<00:02:37.220> really

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:37.520 
laid out until I place them and I really

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:39.430 
laid out until I place them and I really
kind<00:02:37.760> of<00:02:37.820> go<00:02:37.970> on<00:02:38.000> you<00:02:38.510> know<00:02:38.570> that's<00:02:39.110> nothing

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:39.440 
kind of go on you know that's nothing

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:44.200 
kind of go on you know that's nothing
that's<00:02:40.280> too<00:02:40.700> much<00:02:42.310> so<00:02:43.310> imma<00:02:43.520> leave<00:02:43.790> this<00:02:43.970> at

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:44.210 
that's too much so imma leave this at

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:47.530 
that's too much so imma leave this at
this<00:02:44.480> right<00:02:44.930> now<00:02:45.910> and<00:02:46.910> what<00:02:47.120> I'm<00:02:47.210> going<00:02:47.390> to<00:02:47.420> do

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:47.540 
this right now and what I'm going to do

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:50.890 
this right now and what I'm going to do
is<00:02:47.690> bring<00:02:47.960> in<00:02:48.080> a<00:02:48.200> safety<00:02:48.620> relation<00:02:49.660> this<00:02:50.660> is<00:02:50.870> a

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:50.900 
is bring in a safety relation this is a

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:53.950 
is bring in a safety relation this is a
technique<00:02:51.760> I<00:02:52.760> learned<00:02:52.820> from<00:02:53.390> Jonathan's

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:53.960 
technique I learned from Jonathan's

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:57.850 
technique I learned from Jonathan's
Melville<00:02:54.380> I<00:02:55.190> was<00:02:55.910> already<00:02:56.270> creating<00:02:57.050> collage

00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:57.860 
Melville I was already creating collage

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:02.560 
Melville I was already creating collage
papers<00:02:58.460> found<00:02:58.820> papers<00:02:59.390> repurposing<00:03:00.200> them<00:03:01.570> and

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:02.570 
papers found papers repurposing them and

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:05.440 
papers found papers repurposing them and
coding<00:03:03.140> them<00:03:03.320> with<00:03:03.680> just<00:03:03.950> matte<00:03:04.160> medium<00:03:04.459> but

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:05.450 
coding them with just matte medium but

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:07.510 
coding them with just matte medium but
this<00:03:05.630> technique<00:03:06.140> of<00:03:06.320> using<00:03:06.380> the<00:03:06.830> tack<00:03:07.100> iron

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:07.520 
this technique of using the tack iron

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:11.980 
this technique of using the tack iron
and<00:03:07.700> fusing<00:03:08.180> them<00:03:08.330> in<00:03:08.480> place<00:03:09.790> I'm<00:03:10.790> quite<00:03:11.690> fond

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:11.990 
and fusing them in place I'm quite fond

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:14.860 
and fusing them in place I'm quite fond
of<00:03:12.200> so<00:03:12.950> I've<00:03:13.640> been<00:03:13.790> using<00:03:14.000> that<00:03:14.180> now<00:03:14.540> for<00:03:14.600> the

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:14.870 
of so I've been using that now for the

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:21.510 
of so I've been using that now for the
last<00:03:15.050> ten<00:03:15.920> years<00:03:16.870> this<00:03:17.870> is<00:03:18.080> a<00:03:18.110> tear<00:03:18.440> my<00:03:18.680> turn

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:21.520 

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:24.390 

we've<00:03:22.330> got<00:03:22.510> it<00:03:22.630> set<00:03:22.870> about<00:03:23.170> you<00:03:23.440> know<00:03:23.620> 350

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:24.400 
we've got it set about you know 350

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:32.730 
we've got it set about you know 350
which<00:03:24.790> is<00:03:24.940> about<00:03:25.090> 350<00:03:25.750> degrees<00:03:26.260> and<00:03:31.560> now<00:03:32.560> what

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:32.740 
which is about 350 degrees and now what

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:33.870 
which is about 350 degrees and now what
I'm<00:03:32.860> going<00:03:32.920> to<00:03:33.040> do<00:03:33.220> is<00:03:33.340> I'm<00:03:33.520> just<00:03:33.550> going<00:03:33.850> to

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:33.880 
I'm going to do is I'm just going to

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:36.480 
I'm going to do is I'm just going to
fuse<00:03:34.300> this<00:03:34.660> to<00:03:35.080> the<00:03:35.350> surface<00:03:35.860> that's<00:03:36.130> already

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:36.490 
fuse this to the surface that's already

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:42.840 
fuse this to the surface that's already
been<00:03:36.790> dried<00:03:37.180> with<00:03:37.540> the<00:03:38.260> polymer<00:03:38.800> medium<00:03:41.730> and<00:03:42.730> I

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:42.850 
been dried with the polymer medium and I

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:46.530 
been dried with the polymer medium and I
really<00:03:43.210> need<00:03:43.420> to<00:03:43.450> heat<00:03:43.900> this<00:03:44.140> up<00:03:45.390> so<00:03:46.390> the

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:46.540 
really need to heat this up so the

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:48.750 
really need to heat this up so the
safety<00:03:46.780> release<00:03:47.080> she<00:03:47.470> allows<00:03:47.920> the<00:03:48.250> heat<00:03:48.460> to<00:03:48.640> go

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:48.760 
safety release she allows the heat to go

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:53.040 
safety release she allows the heat to go
through<00:03:49.920> look<00:03:50.920> that's<00:03:51.340> hot<00:03:51.610> but<00:03:52.570> it<00:03:52.690> doesn't

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:53.050 
through look that's hot but it doesn't
