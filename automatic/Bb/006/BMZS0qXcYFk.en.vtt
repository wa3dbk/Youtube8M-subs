00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.589
 hello how about youtube friends in this 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:06.180
 video tutorial I will teach you how to 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:11.940
 do a factory restoration to 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:14.039
 our Huawei 730 and good let's start 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:17.770
 The first thing we have to do is 

00:00:14.039 --> 00:00:20.650
 go to our game and ge 730 

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:24.830
 we turn it off and once it's off 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:29.950
 we press the power key and volume more 

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:29.950
 at the same time power and volume more 

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:37.680
 once it's on, we wait for it 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:40.770
 come out an Android monitor with this menu 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:44.260
 let go of the keys 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:47.489
 and we go to the part that says 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:47.489
 to see if it focuses 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:52.019
 to the part that I made 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.579
 uy true factor and reset 

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:01.800
 let's hope that approach 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:09.790
 with the factory racing we go up 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:11.470
 we press power with the program key of 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:13.119
 select we will not move towards 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:15.040
 up and down with the keys 

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:16.700
 volume less to lower the volume more 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:20.409
 to go up 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:20.409
 oppressed diaz 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:26.860
 with the power key and it will start doing 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:26.860
 factory restoration 

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:31.890
 are the things to expect 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:40.220
 Once done, the 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:44.350
 menu 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:46.310
 and we give it where it says bounce system 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:50.870
 The first option 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:54.580
 we give you with the power key and the cell phone 

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:54.580
 it will begin to restart 

00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:03.550
 this method may take several several 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:03.550
 minutes but it 's normal because
