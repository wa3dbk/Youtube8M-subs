00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:17.220
 project b max 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:19.050
 first of all it goes to complete the family 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.660
 of the maxi family ford then given the 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:25.289
 yours the s max in 2006 and after the c max 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:32.940
 of 2010 the b max goes to complete the 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:35.660
 family of max family ford is a 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.800
 project that is totally innovative not 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:41.129
 conventional non-traditional one 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.780
 car that belongs to the card 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:47.640
 baggage segment 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:52.129
 but surely will have the ability to 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.129
 go different foods 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:17.009
 pure transversal as well as typology 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:20.159
 consumer will not surprise me 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:21.570
 fact that will choose the b max is a 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.009
 customer who comes from a car of 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.590
 upper segment because it believes 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:31.229
 correct the size of the car 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:33.690
 still the car is 4 meters long and 0 77 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:36.959
 therefore extremely actor from the segment 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:39.450
 from the segment be it doesn't surprise me either 

00:01:36.959 --> 00:01:41.819
 the fact that some customer of the 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:45.600
 traditional b segment choose to 

00:01:41.819 --> 00:01:50.190
 take the b max because he wants from the 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:53.459
 car one management is a fruition 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:55.799
 of the space that bimax has succeeded in 

00:01:53.459 --> 00:01:58.700
 give compared to the segment car b 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:58.700
 traditional 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:09.810
 I like to say that it is a car 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:13.019
 totally innovative and not 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:14.370
 conventional among other things own aldina 

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:16.920
 of the car's characteristic 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:19.739
 this retractable upright that gives the 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:21.720
 possibility of having a meter and a half of 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:24.120
 accessibility space to enter 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:26.220
 in the car or the 2 meters and 30 of 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:28.440
 space in length because they succeed 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:30.780
 to break down the rear seats and the 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:33.450
 front passenger seat in 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:35.340
 totally flat elements 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:37.920
 related to AIDS technologies in this 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:40.500
 connectivity system that allows you 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:42.019
 voice control of making a series 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:45.100
 of operations related to phone calls 

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:48.010
 to the transfer of music 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:51.660
 inside the car the milk xi of 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:53.920
 stop that allows the vehicle to be locked 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:57.370
 at low speeds to avoid the 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:59.320
 collisions the top methods controls which it is 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:02.320
 a system that we have already launched with 

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:06.040
 the focus is a traction control that 

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:08.140
 acts on the front wheels a 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:10.510
 braking torque that gives you the chance 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:12.280
 to have control of the car in 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:14.770
 curve from the premium segment car 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:17.230
 therefore all elements of technology that 

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:19.560
 they are unexpected for a car of 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:19.560
 this segment 

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:23.800
 the engines available on b 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:27.460
 max will be two petrol engines 

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:29.770
 1400 and 1800 three- cylinder bust e 

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:32.380
 1400 90 horses while the thousand ecoboosts 

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:35.020
 100 action mode will be available 

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:38.350
 and 120 horses the modeling and the 

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:39.850
 1600 95 degree diesel engine 

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:44.970
 the price at the entrance of the engine 

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:44.970
 petrol and 1400 90 horses and 16,250 euros
