00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:07.600
 hi everyone i hope you 

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:08.950
 be fine then today I 'm going 

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:10.090
 show you how I trace my 

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:11.950
 work nar it's a step 

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:13.660
 indispensable in my makeup and 

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:14.140
 it's like I 'm naked when I 

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:15.730
 do not do 

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:17.980
 so I'm doing almost more time 

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:20.109
 I use today my honor 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:22.869
 favorite is the original title to our 

00:00:20.109 --> 00:00:25.989
 young people already much for his tip that 

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:28.829
 refute a little bit and the pot that helps 

00:00:25.989 --> 00:00:30.849
 measure the amount you want 

00:00:28.829 --> 00:00:32.619
 strangely I always place a point 

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:34.540
 in the inner corner of the eye and in fact there 

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:38.580
 I use as a reference to trace a pretty 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:38.580
 fine line at the rating level 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:58.380
 I then trace another trait that goes 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:05.190
 a little closer to the eyebrow and I 

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:05.850
 join the first very big step of 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:07.590
 this step 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.370
 so many times until you have a beautiful 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.370
 comma form 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:23.940
 that's what gives it closer and 

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:25.860
 then what I do is 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:28.470
 still reach the last places 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.870
 who need to be joined all 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:33.840
 simply and I also fulfill some 

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:35.340
 holes that need to be filled and 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.780
 that's what gives both eyes done 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.030
 of course it's not perfect 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.860
 perfect but you try to do the 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.250
 more best possible and that's what 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.250
 I did 

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:51.390
 one last tip that I could you 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.070
 to give is to take your time 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.050
 as you can see the tutorial was 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.400
 done in accelerated so I took my 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:58.140
 time and I advise rappers 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:01.200
 likewise are all this is your first 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.430
 time you will see that it will pay to give a 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.200
 green light at this ussel city you 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.310
