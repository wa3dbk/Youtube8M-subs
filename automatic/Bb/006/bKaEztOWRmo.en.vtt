series i basically talked about the
weapon<00:01:41.040> and<00:01:41.189> then<00:01:41.340> I<00:01:41.400> get<00:01:41.549> my<00:01:41.670> ranking<00:01:42.030> of<00:01:42.180> the

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
weapon and then I get my ranking of the

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:45.740 
weapon and then I get my ranking of the
weapon<00:01:42.600> so<00:01:43.140> for<00:01:43.439> the<00:01:43.649> CBJ<00:01:44.430> submachine<00:01:45.390> gun<00:01:45.540> my

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
weapon so for the CBJ submachine gun my

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.899 
weapon so for the CBJ submachine gun my
ranking<00:01:46.140> of<00:01:46.290> this<00:01:46.470> weapon<00:01:46.680> is<00:01:46.920> probably<00:01:47.729> going

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
ranking of this weapon is probably going

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.240 
ranking of this weapon is probably going
to<00:01:48.060> be<00:01:48.149> a<00:01:48.180> six<00:01:48.570> out<00:01:48.720> of<00:01:48.750> ten<00:01:49.020> now<00:01:49.259> the<00:01:49.860> reason

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
to be a six out of ten now the reason

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.039 
to be a six out of ten now the reason
it's<00:01:50.520> a<00:01:50.610> 6<00:01:50.820> out<00:01:50.939> of<00:01:50.970> 10<00:01:51.180> because<00:01:51.390> it<00:01:51.689> doesn't

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
it's a 6 out of 10 because it doesn't

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:53.660 
it's a 6 out of 10 because it doesn't
hit<00:01:52.229> like<00:01:52.470> every<00:01:52.799> other<00:01:52.950> weapon<00:01:53.340> and<00:01:53.490> call<00:01:53.579> of

duty's I really love submachine guns and
I<00:02:02.700> really<00:02:02.939> thought<00:02:03.060> this<00:02:03.240> was<00:02:03.420> just<00:02:03.630> going<00:02:03.750> to

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
I really thought this was just going to

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.649 
I really thought this was just going to
be<00:02:03.930> the<00:02:04.049> gun<00:02:04.229> be<00:02:04.590> that<00:02:04.770> mp7<00:02:05.369> of<00:02:06.149> call<00:02:06.390> of<00:02:06.420> duty

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
be the gun be that mp7 of call of duty

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:09.080 
be the gun be that mp7 of call of duty
ghosts<00:02:07.020> and<00:02:07.140> just<00:02:07.350> allow<00:02:07.649> me<00:02:07.680> to<00:02:08.129> get<00:02:08.340> enemies

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
ghosts and just allow me to get enemies

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:10.910 
ghosts and just allow me to get enemies
down<00:02:09.300> at<00:02:09.509> range<00:02:09.720> but<00:02:09.959> it<00:02:10.140> really<00:02:10.379> just<00:02:10.590> isn't

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
down at range but it really just isn't

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.490 
down at range but it really just isn't
and<00:02:11.129> this<00:02:11.700> weapon<00:02:12.090> wax<00:02:12.360> at<00:02:12.599> range<00:02:12.870> all

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
and this weapon wax at range all

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:14.900 
and this weapon wax at range all
so<00:02:13.590> the<00:02:13.710> fire<00:02:13.890> rate<00:02:14.100> isn't<00:02:14.280> all<00:02:14.550> that<00:02:14.580> good

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910 
so the fire rate isn't all that good

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:17.240 
so the fire rate isn't all that good
it's<00:02:15.180> just<00:02:15.240> the<00:02:15.480> overall<00:02:15.770> weapon<00:02:16.770> that<00:02:16.950> meets

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
it's just the overall weapon that meets

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.010 
it's just the overall weapon that meets
a<00:02:17.430> ton<00:02:17.610> of<00:02:17.640> improvements<00:02:18.330> and<00:02:18.480> in<00:02:18.720> my<00:02:18.810> personal

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.020 
a ton of improvements and in my personal

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:20.750 
a ton of improvements and in my personal
opinion<00:02:19.260> if<00:02:19.650> I<00:02:19.740> was<00:02:19.890> to<00:02:20.010> improve<00:02:20.250> this<00:02:20.340> weapon

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
opinion if I was to improve this weapon

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.690 
opinion if I was to improve this weapon
I<00:02:20.910> would<00:02:21.300> add<00:02:21.450> a<00:02:21.690> slightly<00:02:22.380> higher<00:02:22.860> fire<00:02:23.490> rate

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
I would add a slightly higher fire rate

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.130 
I would add a slightly higher fire rate
on<00:02:23.880> it<00:02:24.000> and<00:02:24.150> I'll<00:02:24.240> add<00:02:24.450> a<00:02:24.480> little<00:02:24.810> bit<00:02:24.990> more

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
on it and I'll add a little bit more

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:26.720 
on it and I'll add a little bit more
damage<00:02:25.530> and<00:02:25.650> that<00:02:25.830> would<00:02:25.980> I<00:02:26.010> think<00:02:26.130> make<00:02:26.550> that

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
damage and that would I think make that

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:28.550 
damage and that would I think make that
weapon<00:02:27.240> a<00:02:27.300> little<00:02:27.540> bit<00:02:27.630> more<00:02:27.810> equal<00:02:28.230> compared

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
weapon a little bit more equal compared

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:29.810 
weapon a little bit more equal compared
to<00:02:28.680> all<00:02:28.800> the<00:02:28.830> other<00:02:28.950> weapons<00:02:29.430> and<00:02:29.580> call<00:02:29.700> of

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:29.820 
to all the other weapons and call of

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:31.040 
to all the other weapons and call of
duty<00:02:29.970> ghosts<00:02:30.180> because<00:02:30.540> in<00:02:30.750> my<00:02:30.840> personal

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.050 
duty ghosts because in my personal

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:33.140 
duty ghosts because in my personal
opinion<00:02:31.290> this<00:02:31.620> weapon<00:02:31.980> is<00:02:32.100> just<00:02:32.550> it<00:02:32.970> doesn't

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
opinion this weapon is just it doesn't

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:34.340 
opinion this weapon is just it doesn't
have<00:02:33.330> that<00:02:33.360> humph<00:02:33.720> if<00:02:33.930> you<00:02:34.080> know<00:02:34.200> what<00:02:34.290> I<00:02:34.320> mean

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:34.350 
have that humph if you know what I mean

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:36.500 
have that humph if you know what I mean
it<00:02:34.560> just<00:02:34.590> doesn't<00:02:35.190> have<00:02:35.340> that<00:02:35.370> that<00:02:36.150> extra

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
it just doesn't have that that extra

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:38.630 
it just doesn't have that that extra
bullet<00:02:36.810> damage<00:02:37.020> so<00:02:37.530> running<00:02:38.100> dead<00:02:38.340> eye<00:02:38.370> on
