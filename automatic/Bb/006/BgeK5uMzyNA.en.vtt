00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
photosphere so we'll test it down a

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.050 
photosphere so we'll test it down a
little<00:01:51.810> bit<00:01:52.110> that's<00:01:52.770> the<00:01:52.860> senator<00:01:53.280> okay<00:01:53.850> it's

little bit that's the senator okay it's
already<00:01:54.270> set<00:01:54.479> up<00:01:54.600> and<00:01:54.750> photosphere<00:01:55.500> because<00:01:55.950> I

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
already set up and photosphere because I

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.260 
already set up and photosphere because I
was<00:01:56.130> just<00:01:56.219> trying<00:01:56.490> it<00:01:56.579> out<00:01:56.670> just<00:01:56.939> make<00:01:57.149> sure

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:51.600 
have to be choosing performance so now

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:53.990 
have to be choosing performance so now
performance<00:03:52.230> is<00:03:52.410> going<00:03:52.590> to<00:03:52.680> go<00:03:52.800> to<00:03:52.860> the<00:03:53.040> max<00:03:53.370> so

you can see still on blue I don't know
if<00:05:12.900> it's<00:05:13.050> a<00:05:13.080> problem<00:05:13.290> or<00:05:13.650> it<00:05:13.770> has<00:05:13.860> to<00:05:13.950> be

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:14.010 
if it's a problem or it has to be

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:15.920 
if it's a problem or it has to be
charging<00:05:14.460> something<00:05:15.300> like<00:05:15.390> that<00:05:15.570> but<00:05:15.780> let's

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:15.930 
charging something like that but let's

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:17.720 
charging something like that but let's
try<00:05:16.080> it<00:05:16.140> one<00:05:16.350> more<00:05:16.440> time<00:05:16.560> exchanges<00:05:17.370> orange

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:17.730 
try it one more time exchanges orange

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:20.390 
try it one more time exchanges orange
and<00:05:17.970> it<00:05:18.840> still<00:05:19.080> does<00:05:19.200> not<00:05:19.380> change<00:05:19.620> um<00:05:19.980> could<00:05:20.310> be

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:20.400 
and it still does not change um could be

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:22.100 
and it still does not change um could be
just<00:05:20.610> something<00:05:20.880> wrong<00:05:21.180> with<00:05:21.390> it<00:05:21.510> not<00:05:21.900> really

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:22.110 
just something wrong with it not really

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:27.560 
just something wrong with it not really
sure<00:05:22.880> let's<00:05:23.880> go<00:05:24.120> and<00:05:24.420> change<00:05:25.260> LED<00:05:26.220> this<00:05:26.700> up<00:05:27.030> we

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:27.570 
sure let's go and change LED this up we

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:30.080 
sure let's go and change LED this up we
all<00:05:27.660> like<00:05:27.810> to<00:05:27.840> change<00:05:28.050> LEDs<00:05:28.530> I'm<00:05:29.010> LED<00:05:29.700> on<00:05:29.820> let's

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:30.090 
all like to change LEDs I'm LED on let's

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:33.200 
all like to change LEDs I'm LED on let's
change<00:05:30.270> it<00:05:30.420> to<00:05:30.480> three<00:05:31.410> seconds<00:05:31.920> and<00:05:32.160> led<00:05:32.880> off

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:33.210 
change it to three seconds and led off

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:36.050 
change it to three seconds and led off
for<00:05:33.860> one<00:05:34.860> second<00:05:35.340> so<00:05:35.550> it's<00:05:35.670> going<00:05:35.760> to<00:05:35.820> be<00:05:35.910> a<00:05:35.940> lot

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:36.060 
for one second so it's going to be a lot

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:37.280 
for one second so it's going to be a lot
quicker<00:05:36.240> as<00:05:36.570> you<00:05:36.660> can<00:05:36.810> see<00:05:36.990> there's<00:05:37.200> an

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:37.290 
quicker as you can see there's an

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:39.380 
quicker as you can see there's an
example<00:05:37.740> of<00:05:37.800> it<00:05:37.950> right<00:05:37.980> there<00:05:38.280> so<00:05:39.120> it's<00:05:39.300> going

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:39.390 
example of it right there so it's going

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:40.520 
example of it right there so it's going
to<00:05:39.450> be<00:05:39.570> very<00:05:39.600> quick<00:05:39.990> and<00:05:40.140> that's<00:05:40.290> gonna<00:05:40.410> be

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:40.530 
to be very quick and that's gonna be

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:42.410 
to be very quick and that's gonna be
example<00:05:40.980> you'll<00:05:41.250> see<00:05:41.460> on<00:05:41.670> your<00:05:41.850> device<00:05:42.180> on

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:42.420 
example you'll see on your device on

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:44.720 
example you'll see on your device on
your<00:05:42.510> Galaxy<00:05:42.870> Nexus<00:05:42.930> on<00:05:43.260> the<00:05:43.380> bottom<00:05:43.710> and<00:05:43.860> we

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:44.730 
your Galaxy Nexus on the bottom and we

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:46.400 
your Galaxy Nexus on the bottom and we
can<00:05:44.880> have<00:05:45.000> to<00:05:45.180> change<00:05:45.420> the<00:05:45.540> brightness<00:05:45.690> you

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:46.410 
can have to change the brightness you

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:49.000 
can have to change the brightness you
can<00:05:46.530> change<00:05:46.740> the<00:05:46.860> medium<00:05:47.220> laser<00:05:47.880> beam<00:05:48.210> even

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:49.010 
can change the medium laser beam even

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:52.160 
can change the medium laser beam even
and<00:05:50.010> hassey<00:05:50.490> grant<00:05:50.850> some<00:05:51.120> superuser<00:05:51.990> access

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:52.170 
and hassey grant some superuser access

00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:54.830 
and hassey grant some superuser access
as<00:05:52.680> well<00:05:52.740> but<00:05:53.670> it<00:05:53.820> does<00:05:54.000> complete<00:05:54.390> rooted<00:05:54.690> see

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:15.450 
should LED should be working so let's

00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:16.820 
should LED should be working so let's
give<00:06:15.600> that<00:06:15.750> a<00:06:15.780> few<00:06:15.960> seconds<00:06:16.350> hopefully<00:06:16.650> does

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:16.830 
give that a few seconds hopefully does

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:18.320 
give that a few seconds hopefully does
work<00:06:17.070> I'm<00:06:17.310> not<00:06:17.550> very<00:06:17.700> sure<00:06:17.850> if<00:06:18.090> it's<00:06:18.210> gonna

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:18.330 
work I'm not very sure if it's gonna

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:21.410
