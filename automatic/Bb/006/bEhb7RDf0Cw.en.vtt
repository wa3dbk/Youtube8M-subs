 many of you do you see many times 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.740
 I recommend that you see more often because 

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:30.750
 this is a basic performance when to perform 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.520

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:37.199
 This you can already without problems on 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:39.510
 make and wave options smoothly and 

00:00:37.199 --> 00:00:42.620
