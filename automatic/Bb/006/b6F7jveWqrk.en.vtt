00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:07.500
 today we are going to prepare some ribs 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:09.870
 roast pork with mustard and honey for 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.090
 we're going to need a piece of 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.250
 pork ribs in this case I would 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:17.250
 I have asked to leave it we are going to 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:19.589
 need a little honey this is 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.869
 natural heather honey then you have to 

00:00:19.589 --> 00:00:23.849
 be careful that if it is a natural honey 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:27.230
 we will always need less than if 

00:00:23.849 --> 00:00:30.380
 out an industrial honey 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:34.200
 a little olive oil mustard a 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:38.700
 little rosemary a glass of white wine 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:40.100
 and a broth or soy salt pill goes on 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.320
 pleasures 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:46.570
 let's start by putting the oven 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:46.570
 preheated to 180 degrees 

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:53.219
 we put the ribs in a source of 

00:00:50.109 --> 00:00:53.219
 refractory reflection 

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:01.020
 we put a little salt 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.270
 a little bit of olive oil 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:18.970
 and we put it to speak it 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.540
 we are going to prepare the potatoes we are going to 

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:26.840
 peel wash and we'll cut them in 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.340
 blades 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:31.670
 once we have the potatoes 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:34.500
 laminated and washed we will place them 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:36.180
 at the source of the roast 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:42.650
 once we have placed the potatoes 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:42.650
 in the tray as the background around 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.520
 we reinsert the tray with the 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.229
 potatoes and ribs in the oven and 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:53.600
 let's raise the temperature of the oven 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:53.600
 of 180 degrees we had it to 200 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.270
 Now let's prepare the broth with the 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:01.580
 that we're going to water the ribs 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:01.580
 let's take a teaspoon of rosemary 

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:08.050
 the broth pill discarded 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:10.360
 to see the broth pill if you have 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:12.910
 homemade broth can always be substituted 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:16.680
 and gives better result but in absence 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:16.680
 then we manage with this 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:25.950
 we add a spoonful 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:25.950
 of honey 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:35.280
 and using it as a reference we're going to 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.280
 add also two tablespoons of mustard 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:41.770
 and now let's take the second 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:43.959
 as we see well in this first mix 

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:45.690
 before adding the olive oil and the 

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:47.430
 wine 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:50.100
 Now that everything is well mixed 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:53.360
 we add the wine 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:53.360
 we mix again 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:03:00.010
 and we also add a drop of oil one 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:00.010
 good spoon 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:10.219
 we mix and with this broth let's go 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:10.219
 watering the meat every 10 minutes 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:18.109
 let's water and now every ten minutes 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:20.540
 we will repeat the process of watering 

00:03:18.109 --> 00:03:22.400
 We will leave the meat on this side 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:24.590
 half an hour and then we'll turn it around 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:26.620
 and we will do it on the other hand another half 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:26.620
 hour 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:33.190
 and spent about an hour this 

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:33.190
 it is the result 

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:44.340
 I hope you like it and until next time
