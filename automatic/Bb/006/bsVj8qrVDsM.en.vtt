owner<00:01:14.909> so<00:01:15.180> I<00:01:15.420> don't<00:01:15.990> think<00:01:16.170> she's<00:01:16.290> gonna<00:01:16.470> do

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
easy so I don't think it's gonna be an

00:01:21.390 --> 00:02:34.160 
easy so I don't think it's gonna be an
issue

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:37.310 

really<00:02:35.070> not<00:02:35.280> all<00:02:35.700> backed<00:02:36.060> up<00:02:36.270> hardly<00:02:37.230> any

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:37.320 
really not all backed up hardly any

00:02:37.320 --> 00:03:23.960 
really not all backed up hardly any
pressure<00:02:37.680> all<00:02:38.220> arrangements

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:23.970 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:27.420 

she's<00:03:24.970> got<00:03:25.150> a<00:03:25.180> really<00:03:25.569> show<00:03:26.230> your<00:03:26.349> job<00:03:26.680> really

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:27.430 
she's got a really show your job really

00:03:27.430 --> 00:04:36.540 
she's got a really show your job really
not

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:36.550 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:38.939 

like<00:04:37.150> it<00:04:37.300> says<00:04:37.509> never<00:04:37.960> trying<00:04:38.289> to<00:04:38.349> fold<00:04:38.590> run

00:04:38.939 --> 00:04:38.949 
like it says never trying to fold run

00:04:38.949 --> 00:04:42.119 
like it says never trying to fold run
off<00:04:39.099> a<00:04:39.250> meter<00:04:39.490> under<00:04:40.440> another<00:04:41.440> reason<00:04:41.800> I<00:04:41.889> think

00:04:42.119 --> 00:04:42.129 
off a meter under another reason I think

00:04:42.129 --> 00:04:43.950 
off a meter under another reason I think
that<00:04:42.400> would<00:04:42.550> be<00:04:42.580> her<00:04:42.819> nature<00:04:43.090> or<00:04:43.360> instinct

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:43.960 
that would be her nature or instinct

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:46.710 
that would be her nature or instinct
when<00:04:44.770> we<00:04:44.919> wit<00:04:45.129> the<00:04:45.280> catcher<00:04:45.550> not<00:04:46.090> me<00:04:46.330> actually

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:46.720 
when we wit the catcher not me actually

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:48.330 
when we wit the catcher not me actually
could<00:04:46.900> sure<00:04:47.050> but<00:04:47.199> the<00:04:47.289> guy<00:04:47.440> that<00:04:47.470> owner<00:04:47.949> would

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:48.340 
could sure but the guy that owner would

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:50.100 
could sure but the guy that owner would
catch<00:04:48.639> her<00:04:48.789> and<00:04:49.330> they<00:04:49.419> were<00:04:49.509> trying<00:04:49.780> to<00:04:49.840> lead
