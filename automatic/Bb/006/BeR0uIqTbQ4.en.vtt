00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:13.000
 hello everyone I searched and searched the 

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:15.730
 network I have not found a game in format 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.860
 ghost for xbox 360 the most annoying is 

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:20.860
 that when you downloaded an iso that weigh by 

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:22.570
 typically 6 to 7 gigas decompresses 

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:24.670
 and when it comes to converting something that 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:26.949
 actually games come out with less than one 

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:29.320
 giga is the example of plants against 

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:31.750
 zombies that in iso weighed 7 gigas but to 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:34.449
 the time to convert weighs about 500 megabytes 

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:36.610
 the truth to me is a loss of 

00:00:34.449 --> 00:00:39.370
 time download that kind of games that 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:40.960
 it does not really weigh so I've uploaded a 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:43.420
 game in got so that you what 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:45.730
 download in a short time is the 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:47.440
 plants against zombies I hope that you 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:50.050
 like and receive your thanks 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:51.969
 because apparently there is no goal online 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:54.489
 in the same way I hope not to be 

00:00:51.969 --> 00:00:56.890
 doing something else I have several games 

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:58.149
 gotti I'm going to go up since 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:00.219
 we are here I want to give a 

00:00:58.149 --> 00:01:02.620
 thanks to the developers of 

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:05.110
 rgh and those who are dedicated to raising 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:07.140
 games without them it would not be possible to 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:07.140
 this 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.530
 the following is very easy I have already given them 

00:01:11.579 --> 00:01:16.200
 the game fit everything so just 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:18.899
 is to copy the game to the xbox 360 in my 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:21.630
 case I'm going to copy it via ftp there are several 

00:01:18.899 --> 00:01:24.299
 videos how to make the ftp connection and 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:27.270
 xbox appears with a computer so 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:29.429
 I do not need any program one speaks in 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:32.729
 the plans versus zombie folder these 

00:01:29.429 --> 00:01:36.270
 open the folder content 3 open the 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:39.840
 folder of the 1604 copy the four 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:42.420
 folders in the directory and xbox360 hdd 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:46.200
 1 content and paste it inside the folder 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:48.330
 with 16 zeros 5 copy the rest of the 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.850
 folders in the folder where they store the 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:52.830
 games of your xbox in my case I keep them 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:57.090
 in content inside the folder of the 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:59.039
 16 06 reboot in the freestyle so that 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.229
 the game appears in my case already 

00:01:59.039 --> 00:02:03.750
 has the cover to you can you 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:05.939
 appear to them without it they should only go down 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:08.470
 puntocom the album art cover and put it 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:10.899
 from the web csd 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:13.630
 that's all remember I'll keep going up 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:15.910
 games I hope the users 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:19.980
 download the games because that is going to 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:19.980
