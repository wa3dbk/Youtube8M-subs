there<00:02:24.959> now<00:02:25.260> yeah<00:02:25.860> there<00:02:26.069> are<00:02:26.130> places<00:02:26.340> that<00:02:26.549> you

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
there now yeah there are places that you

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:29.210 
there now yeah there are places that you
can<00:02:26.970> operate<00:02:27.239> freely<00:02:27.630> and<00:02:27.900> I<00:02:27.989> think<00:02:28.290> that<00:02:28.530> the

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
can operate freely and I think that the

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.069 
can operate freely and I think that the
missionary<00:02:29.670> that<00:02:29.880> you've<00:02:30.000> recorded<00:02:30.720> earlier

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:31.079 
missionary that you've recorded earlier

00:02:31.079 --> 00:02:33.350 
missionary that you've recorded earlier
is<00:02:31.890> correct<00:02:32.220> and<00:02:32.640> that<00:02:32.700> you<00:02:32.940> have<00:02:33.090> to<00:02:33.209> work

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
is correct and that you have to work

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.449 
is correct and that you have to work
with<00:02:33.540> people<00:02:33.720> you<00:02:33.870> can<00:02:34.140> trust<00:02:34.290> that's<00:02:35.040> people

00:02:35.449 --> 00:02:35.459 
with people you can trust that's people

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:37.490 
with people you can trust that's people
that<00:02:35.489> you<00:02:35.670> can<00:02:35.819> put<00:02:35.970> your<00:02:36.209> life<00:02:36.870> in<00:02:37.079> their<00:02:37.230> care

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
that you can put your life in their care

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.400 
that you can put your life in their care
but<00:02:38.510> there<00:02:39.510> are<00:02:39.630> a<00:02:39.660> lot<00:02:39.780> of<00:02:39.810> places<00:02:40.019> that<00:02:40.290> you

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
but there are a lot of places that you

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:42.349 
but there are a lot of places that you
can't<00:02:40.680> go<00:02:40.920> and<00:02:41.190> it's<00:02:41.489> very<00:02:41.760> dangerous<00:02:41.940> you

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:42.359 
can't go and it's very dangerous you

00:02:42.359 --> 00:02:44.210 
can't go and it's very dangerous you
know<00:02:42.420> just<00:02:42.600> because<00:02:42.840> Afghanistan<00:02:43.530> has<00:02:44.190> a
