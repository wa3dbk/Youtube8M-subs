00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.120
 hello thank you for watching now what we're going 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:08.550
 to make is a rich turkey marinated first 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:11.280
 What we are going to do first is contribute 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.750
 the marinade all the ingredients and 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.450
 amounts will be in the 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:18.960
 video instructions first we're going to 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:21.750
 put a little to heat a pan or a 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:25.740
 pot where we are going to put everything and heat 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:29.400
 about three cups of water for when 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:31.460
 let's put it on, we're going to put a 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:34.440
 little oil here we already have 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:37.930
 preheated 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:40.650
 let's take a little bit of the chiles that 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:40.650
 medium-high 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:59.210
 careful course that has the 

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:59.210
 fan 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:08.350
 let's put an onion quarter already 

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:10.970
 you sell involved so that those who 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:14.050
 Work was done then do not bother 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:14.050
 garlic cloves 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:28.270
 the hidden ones 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:28.270
 the oregano 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:40.070
 what are missing the cloves the pepper does not 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:40.070
 you have and we're going to put the water 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:48.399
 I dont know 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:48.399
 but I went back to this side 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.310
 the hot water 

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:59.340
 we are not going to boil 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:02.980
 until they are the ones that do not 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:05.420
 We serve for like 5 minutes 

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:09.349
 they are already tender 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:13.190
 are ready to pass them to our 

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:15.709
 blender and morelia in the glass of the 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:18.290
 blender and let it cool a bit 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:22.200
 to not put it hot that can be 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:27.450
 dangerous and we're going to put 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:31.450
 a cup of orange juice 2 tablespoons 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:35.870
 tureens of consuming chicken powder 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:39.240
 and then we're going to skip this so that 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:41.870
 do not make much noise in the ear here 

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:45.909
 It smells delicious 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:45.909
 Now what we are going to do is strain it 

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:56.980
 since it is very clear we are going to 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:03:02.560
 let's marinate our and we already have the 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:02.560
 logo has strained we have our 

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:08.090
 approximately 20 pounds is a little 

00:03:05.829 --> 00:03:11.930
 more than 20 and a half 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:16.590
 we are going to put two and not 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:18.750
 the bacon we are going to put it between the skin 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:22.520
 there are people who put butter 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:25.700
 also for butter but 

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:30.440
 also it has only worked much more 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:32.030
 put the bacon because I do not know 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:35.120
 butter melts and goes to 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:39.980
 down and the bacon is not left there it goes 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:43.580
 they are cooking and they are going to stay there and go 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:45.690
 to avoid that the breast of the turkey 

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:47.520
 I know that 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:49.230
 in this way we do not need to inject 

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:53.300
 Nothing of that 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:53.300
 remember to inject fat 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:59.690
 it does not help at all because as it is a 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:59.690
 dead animal does not run 

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:05.640
 but covering 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:05.640
 the breast 

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:20.410
 and we are going to put 

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:23.650
 the marinade and we will distribute it well 

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:25.850
 all the payment and we will leave all the 

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:30.050
 night marinating 

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:32.350
 we would do well with him with everything 

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:32.350
 what are we going 

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:39.930
 abundance we are going to put it to 

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:43.229
 refrigerator and we're going to 

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:45.780
 all night or at least about 10 

00:04:43.229 --> 00:04:48.350
 hours we cover them and we go in the 

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:48.350
 desperate 

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:51.900
 and we're going 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:55.910
 and even in 

00:05:01.969 --> 00:05:04.749
 all the filling 

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:16.440
 fill in the old invoices of 

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:18.930
 loose that we did not put salt because 

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:21.770
 the consommÃ© powder already salty if 

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:25.260
 like to put a little more 

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:28.250
 we're not going to cover and we're going to bake it 

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:28.250
 we have the oven 

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:31.910
 a nail 

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:39.969
 we will bake us 

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:43.120
 six hours east 

00:05:39.969 --> 00:05:50.360
 the payment is 20 pounds 

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:53.620
 We're going to give you 20 minutes for every pound 

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:53.620
 we're going to bake it 

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:57.050
 6 hours 

00:05:57.460 --> 00:06:04.420
 67 minutes we are going to uncover it as 15 

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:09.700
 minutes before to 

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:12.190
 bake it uncovered and it becomes a little 

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:14.340
 caramelize the skin let's put it to 

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:18.919
 oven 

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:18.919
 and we will give in 6 hours 

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:26.470
 this is already a day after 125 degrees 

00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:28.969
 for 6 hours 

00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:32.199
 we are going to 

00:06:28.969 --> 00:06:32.199
 we are going to cover it 

00:06:32.409 --> 00:06:36.070
 for 

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:39.580
 s 

00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:42.040
 I toasted a little about ten minutes 

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:46.060
 fifteen to touch a little more 

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:49.510

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:52.330
