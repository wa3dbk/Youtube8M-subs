00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:09.610 
beat this base now the first thing we're

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:11.070 
beat this base now the first thing we're
going<00:01:09.700> to<00:01:09.789> be<00:01:09.880> doing<00:01:10.000> here<00:01:10.300> is<00:01:10.360> funneling<00:01:10.930> in

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:11.080 
going to be doing here is funneling in

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:13.740 
going to be doing here is funneling in
our<00:01:11.229> dragons<00:01:11.710> and<00:01:11.920> what<00:01:12.460> this<00:01:12.640> means<00:01:12.940> is<00:01:13.330> we're

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:13.750 
our dragons and what this means is we're

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:15.359 
our dragons and what this means is we're
trying<00:01:13.899> to<00:01:14.140> take<00:01:14.320> out<00:01:14.470> these<00:01:14.649> outside

00:01:15.359 --> 00:01:15.369 
trying to take out these outside

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:17.760 
trying to take out these outside
structures<00:01:15.970> here<00:01:16.330> so<00:01:16.869> that<00:01:17.050> we<00:01:17.080> can<00:01:17.350> easily

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:17.770 
structures here so that we can easily

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:19.080 
structures here so that we can easily
get<00:01:17.920> to<00:01:18.039> the<00:01:18.160> core<00:01:18.340> and<00:01:18.369> take<00:01:18.610> out<00:01:18.759> these<00:01:18.880> air

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:19.090 
get to the core and take out these air

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:21.450 
get to the core and take out these air
defenses<00:01:19.600> now<00:01:20.380> it's<00:01:20.680> an<00:01:20.770> all<00:01:20.890> dragon<00:01:21.220> attack

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:21.460 
defenses now it's an all dragon attack

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:22.800 
defenses now it's an all dragon attack
so<00:01:21.640> we<00:01:21.759> don't<00:01:21.910> need<00:01:22.060> to<00:01:22.119> worry<00:01:22.240> about<00:01:22.360> pulling

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:22.810 
so we don't need to worry about pulling

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:24.630 
so we don't need to worry about pulling
the<00:01:22.840> CC<00:01:23.289> so<00:01:23.860> we're<00:01:24.009> not<00:01:24.100> going<00:01:24.250> to<00:01:24.310> mess<00:01:24.460> with

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:24.640 
the CC so we're not going to mess with

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:27.600 
the CC so we're not going to mess with
that<00:01:25.020> what<00:01:26.020> we<00:01:26.140> are<00:01:26.259> going<00:01:26.410> to<00:01:26.470> do<00:01:26.619> is<00:01:26.649> drop<00:01:27.399> a

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:27.610 
that what we are going to do is drop a

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:30.060 
that what we are going to do is drop a
dragon<00:01:28.060> here<00:01:28.270> on<00:01:28.450> the<00:01:28.570> outside<00:01:28.960> on<00:01:29.229> both

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:30.070 
dragon here on the outside on both

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:31.529 
dragon here on the outside on both
outsides<00:01:30.550> here<00:01:30.820> and<00:01:31.060> they're<00:01:31.179> going<00:01:31.270> to<00:01:31.360> take

00:01:31.529 --> 00:01:31.539 
outsides here and they're going to take

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:33.660 
outsides here and they're going to take
out<00:01:31.690> a<00:01:31.720> building<00:01:32.229> no<00:01:32.770> or<00:01:32.920> essentially<00:01:33.520> doing

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:33.670 
out a building no or essentially doing

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:35.490 
out a building no or essentially doing
here<00:01:33.970> is<00:01:34.090> creating<00:01:34.479> a<00:01:34.570> funnel<00:01:34.960> to<00:01:35.110> the<00:01:35.229> middle

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:35.500 
here is creating a funnel to the middle

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:37.440 
here is creating a funnel to the middle
and<00:01:35.649> the<00:01:36.100> reason<00:01:36.399> I<00:01:36.490> chose<00:01:36.670> this<00:01:36.729> side<00:01:37.149> to<00:01:37.300> come

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:37.450 
and the reason I chose this side to come

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:39.150 
and the reason I chose this side to come
in<00:01:37.630> you<00:01:37.869> could<00:01:38.020> have<00:01:38.110> also<00:01:38.259> chosen<00:01:38.619> this<00:01:38.920> side

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:39.160 
in you could have also chosen this side

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:40.770 
in you could have also chosen this side
doesn't<00:01:39.729> really<00:01:40.030> matter<00:01:40.209> which<00:01:40.420> side<00:01:40.630> you

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:40.780 
doesn't really matter which side you

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:42.630 
doesn't really matter which side you
choose<00:01:40.810> but<00:01:41.709> you<00:01:41.830> want<00:01:42.009> to<00:01:42.099> come<00:01:42.250> in<00:01:42.369> on<00:01:42.520> the

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:44.590 
side that has two adjacent air defenses

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:46.760 
side that has two adjacent air defenses
and<00:01:44.830> you're<00:01:45.550> going<00:01:45.670> to<00:01:45.729> want<00:01:45.880> to<00:01:45.940> be<00:01:46.060> coming<00:01:46.390> in

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
and you're going to want to be coming in

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.969 
and you're going to want to be coming in
where<00:01:47.770> the<00:01:48.039> clan<00:01:48.489> castle<00:01:49.649> like<00:01:50.649> if<00:01:50.770> you<00:01:50.890> were

00:01:50.969 --> 00:01:50.979 
where the clan castle like if you were

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:52.350 
where the clan castle like if you were
to<00:01:51.069> draw<00:01:51.250> a<00:01:51.280> line<00:01:51.580> between<00:01:51.610> the<00:01:52.060> two<00:01:52.179> air

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:52.360 
to draw a line between the two air

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:53.760 
to draw a line between the two air
defenses<00:01:52.810> and<00:01:52.989> then<00:01:53.110> one<00:01:53.319> from<00:01:53.500> the<00:01:53.560> clan

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:53.770 
defenses and then one from the clan

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:55.410 
defenses and then one from the clan
castle<00:01:53.800> you<00:01:54.729> want<00:01:54.910> it<00:01:54.970> to<00:01:55.090> be<00:01:55.119> perpendicular

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:55.420 
castle you want it to be perpendicular

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:57.180 
castle you want it to be perpendicular
with<00:01:56.050> the<00:01:56.200> line<00:01:56.380> between<00:01:56.619> the<00:01:56.920> two<00:01:57.039> air

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:57.190 
with the line between the two air

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:59.010 
with the line between the two air
defenses<00:01:57.640> so<00:01:58.209> that's<00:01:58.420> what<00:01:58.569> I'm<00:01:58.630> coming<00:01:58.929> in

00:01:59.010 --> 00:01:59.020 
defenses so that's what I'm coming in

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:00.930 
defenses so that's what I'm coming in
from<00:01:59.170> this<00:01:59.319> side<00:01:59.530> there's<00:02:00.099> two<00:02:00.280> air<00:02:00.459> defenses

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:00.940 
from this side there's two air defenses

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:03.389 
from this side there's two air defenses
and<00:02:01.209> the<00:02:01.330> line<00:02:01.770> would<00:02:02.770> be<00:02:02.830> straight<00:02:03.220> through

00:02:03.389 --> 00:02:03.399 
and the line would be straight through

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:05.760 
and the line would be straight through
the<00:02:03.520> middle<00:02:03.550> right<00:02:03.970> here<00:02:04.000> so<00:02:04.899> what<00:02:05.679> we're

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:05.770 
the middle right here so what we're

you'll see here how I

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:48.360 
you'll see here how I
on<00:02:46.450> my<00:02:46.599> dragons<00:02:47.080> we<00:02:47.709> want<00:02:47.860> to<00:02:47.920> keep<00:02:48.069> them<00:02:48.160> all

together but definitely not on top of
each<00:02:50.110> other<00:02:50.260> because<00:02:50.590> those<00:02:50.739> Wizards<00:02:51.130> could

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 
each other because those Wizards could

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:53.040 
each other because those Wizards could
do<00:02:51.430> some<00:02:51.610> serious<00:02:51.790> damage<00:02:52.000> to<00:02:52.569> the<00:02:52.690> Dragons

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:53.050
