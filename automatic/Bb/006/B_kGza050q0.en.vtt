00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:33.400 
mini tech review so this isn't about

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:36.330 
mini tech review so this isn't about
scores<00:00:33.850> is<00:00:34.090> looking<00:00:34.450> about<00:00:34.740> you<00:00:35.740> know<00:00:35.860> useful

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:36.340 
scores is looking about you know useful

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:38.040

bits of tag that you can use every day

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:40.830 
bits of tag that you can use every day
to<00:00:38.230> enhance<00:00:39.040> your<00:00:39.460> peripherals<00:00:40.030> and<00:00:40.300> just

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:40.840 
to enhance your peripherals and just

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:41.820 
to enhance your peripherals and just
generally<00:00:41.110> going<00:00:41.230> to<00:00:41.290> help<00:00:41.440> you<00:00:41.500> out<00:00:41.530> which<00:00:41.740> is

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:41.830 
generally going to help you out which is

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:43.290 
generally going to help you out which is
why<00:00:41.980> don't<00:00:42.310> necessarily<00:00:42.640> give<00:00:42.730> them<00:00:42.880> a<00:00:43.000> score

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:43.300 
why don't necessarily give them a score

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:45.240 
why don't necessarily give them a score
but<00:00:43.900> normally<00:00:44.440> I<00:00:44.470> end<00:00:44.710> up<00:00:44.770> giving<00:00:44.920> them<00:00:45.160> a

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:45.250 
but normally I end up giving them a

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
but normally I end up giving them a
recommendation<00:00:45.900> so<00:00:46.900> this<00:00:47.200> is<00:00:47.290> the<00:00:47.410> box<00:00:48.270> for

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:49.270 
recommendation so this is the box for

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:51.600 
recommendation so this is the box for
the<00:00:49.600> device<00:00:50.200> not<00:00:50.740> much<00:00:50.950> really<00:00:50.980> to<00:00:51.310> tell<00:00:51.490> you

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:51.610 
the device not much really to tell you

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:54.510 
the device not much really to tell you
from<00:00:51.820> this<00:00:52.390> rather<00:00:53.320> than<00:00:53.470> a<00:00:53.620> few<00:00:53.920> little<00:00:54.190> key

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:54.520 
from this rather than a few little key

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:56.790 
from this rather than a few little key
points<00:00:55.090> on<00:00:55.270> the<00:00:55.870> corner<00:00:56.200> here<00:00:56.230> which<00:00:56.500> is<00:00:56.650> that

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:56.800 
points on the corner here which is that

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:59.970 
points on the corner here which is that
it<00:00:57.040> supports<00:00:57.930> USB<00:00:58.930> 3.0<00:00:59.290> so<00:00:59.770> obviously

00:00:59.970 --> 00:00:59.980 
it supports USB 3.0 so obviously

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:01.980 
it supports USB 3.0 so obviously
backwards<00:01:00.370> compatible<00:01:00.790> with<00:01:00.910> 2<00:01:01.480> point<00:01:01.720> 0<00:01:01.780> and

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:01.990 
backwards compatible with 2 point 0 and

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:04.950 
backwards compatible with 2 point 0 and
1<00:01:02.110> point<00:01:02.290> 1<00:01:02.440> devices<00:01:02.860> hot-swap<00:01:03.960> compatible

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:04.960 
1 point 1 devices hot-swap compatible

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:07.230 
1 point 1 devices hot-swap compatible
its<00:01:05.140> driver<00:01:05.409> free<00:01:05.740> which<00:01:05.950> is<00:01:05.979> great<00:01:06.130> and<00:01:06.429> its

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:07.240 
its driver free which is great and its

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:12.239 
its driver free which is great and its
high<00:01:07.840> quality<00:01:08.079> now<00:01:08.729> bye-bye<00:01:09.729> box<00:01:10.350> this<00:01:11.350> is<00:01:11.590> the

high quality now bye-bye box this is the

00:01:12.249 --> 00:01:13.980 
high quality now bye-bye box this is the

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:13.990 
device this is the hub now you have

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:17.429 
device this is the hub now you have
three<00:01:14.020> USB<00:01:14.950> ports<00:01:15.270> along<00:01:16.270> the<00:01:16.390> top<00:01:16.570> and<00:01:16.689> one<00:01:17.259> at

00:01:17.429 --> 00:01:17.439 
three USB ports along the top and one at

00:01:17.439 --> 00:01:19.440 
three USB ports along the top and one at
the<00:01:17.710> end<00:01:17.740> which<00:01:18.189> is<00:01:18.340> useful<00:01:18.640> because<00:01:18.999> this<00:01:19.299> is

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:19.450 
the end which is useful because this is

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:21.749 
the end which is useful because this is
in<00:01:20.259> a<00:01:20.380> sec<00:01:20.499> I've<00:01:20.619> sort<00:01:21.219> of<00:01:21.249> said<00:01:21.460> on<00:01:21.640> though

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:35.950 
got out I on what's this but you plug it

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:38.249 
got out I on what's this but you plug it
on<00:01:36.009> the<00:01:36.100> end<00:01:36.249> of<00:01:36.759> the<00:01:37.389> USB<00:01:37.689> adapter<00:01:38.079> and<00:01:38.170> then

00:01:38.249 --> 00:01:38.259 
on the end of the USB adapter and then

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:39.719 
on the end of the USB adapter and then
you<00:01:38.319> can<00:01:38.469> plug<00:01:38.649> it<00:01:38.770> into<00:01:38.920> your<00:01:39.039> phone<00:01:39.310> so<00:01:39.549> for

of<00:02:02.350> plugging<00:02:02.889> this<00:02:02.979> in<00:02:03.130> to<00:02:03.249> charge<00:02:03.490> my<00:02:03.819> device

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:04.090 
of plugging this in to charge my device

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:07.109 
of plugging this in to charge my device
because<00:02:04.600> this<00:02:04.810> is<00:02:04.959> the<00:02:05.109> output<00:02:05.409> cable<00:02:06.069> I<00:02:06.219> wish

00:02:07.109 --> 00:02:07.119 
because this is the output cable I wish

because this is the output cable I wish
you'd<00:02:07.240> normally<00:02:07.359> have<00:02:07.600> plugged<00:02:07.899> into<00:02:08.080> your

you<00:02:16.070> know<00:02:16.160> you<00:02:16.220> can<00:02:16.490> transfer<00:02:16.910> data<00:02:16.940> easily<00:02:17.420> to

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:17.840 
you know you can transfer data easily to

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:21.580 
you know you can transfer data easily to
any<00:02:18.140> device<00:02:18.830> that<00:02:18.860> uses<00:02:19.130> a<00:02:19.340> mini<00:02:19.880> USB<00:02:20.470> which<00:02:21.470> is

any device that uses a mini USB which is
great<00:02:21.770> and<00:02:21.860> I<00:02:21.890> love<00:02:22.040> the<00:02:22.130> way<00:02:22.220> they've<00:02:22.370> just

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:22.640 
great and I love the way they've just

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:24.730 
great and I love the way they've just
attached<00:02:22.910> it<00:02:23.090> I'm<00:02:23.720> not<00:02:23.960> too<00:02:24.080> sure<00:02:24.260> necessarily

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:24.740 
attached it I'm not too sure necessarily

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:27.640 
attached it I'm not too sure necessarily
about<00:02:24.800> this<00:02:25.010> cable<00:02:25.460> i<00:02:25.640> am<00:02:26.330> quite<00:02:26.750> wary<00:02:27.110> taking

about this cable i am quite wary taking
on<00:02:27.770> and<00:02:27.920> off<00:02:28.010> because<00:02:28.160> i<00:02:28.190> don't<00:02:28.310> want<00:02:28.340> to

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:28.490 
on and off because i don't want to

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:31.330 
on and off because i don't want to
necessarily<00:02:28.580> rip<00:02:29.030> it<00:02:29.150> off<00:02:29.300> and<00:02:29.920> but<00:02:30.920> I<00:02:30.950> mean<00:02:31.160> it

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:31.340 
necessarily rip it off and but I mean it

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:33.220 
necessarily rip it off and but I mean it
seems<00:02:31.820> okay<00:02:32.120> and<00:02:32.150> it<00:02:32.330> just<00:02:32.480> hangs<00:02:32.690> there<00:02:32.810> when

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:33.230 
seems okay and it just hangs there when

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:35.110 
seems okay and it just hangs there when
you're<00:02:33.380> done<00:02:33.410> so<00:02:33.860> that's<00:02:34.190> cool<00:02:34.370> but<00:02:35.030> obviously

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:35.120 
you're done so that's cool but obviously

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:37.450

samsung galaxy s4 my ipad air and have

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:01.930 
samsung galaxy s4 my ipad air and have
it<00:03:00.350> plugged<00:03:00.590> in<00:03:00.830> with<00:03:01.040> you<00:03:01.400> know<00:03:01.490> some<00:03:01.670> USB

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:01.940 
it plugged in with you know some USB

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:03.820 
it plugged in with you know some USB
sticks<00:03:02.270> and<00:03:02.390> stuff<00:03:02.480> and<00:03:02.540> it<00:03:02.750> runs<00:03:02.900> fine<00:03:03.140> but

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:03.830 
sticks and stuff and it runs fine but

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:05.770 
sticks and stuff and it runs fine but
they<00:03:04.070> do<00:03:04.130> sort<00:03:04.580> of<00:03:04.640> say<00:03:04.730> I<00:03:04.760> think<00:03:04.850> it's<00:03:05.180> to

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:05.780 
they do sort of say I think it's to

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:07.660 
they do sort of say I think it's to
external<00:03:06.350> hard<00:03:06.530> drives<00:03:06.800> running<00:03:07.340> off<00:03:07.430> this

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:07.670 
external hard drives running off this

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:11.440 
external hard drives running off this
would<00:03:07.940> be<00:03:08.120> would<00:03:08.390> meet<00:03:08.600> its<00:03:08.920> maximum<00:03:10.450> power

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:11.450 
would be would meet its maximum power

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:14.110 
would be would meet its maximum power
output<00:03:11.920> basically<00:03:12.920> so<00:03:13.460> but<00:03:13.610> you<00:03:13.700> can<00:03:13.850> read<00:03:13.940> all

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:14.120 
output basically so but you can read all

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:15.610 
output basically so but you can read all
the<00:03:14.240> information<00:03:14.450> about<00:03:14.840> that<00:03:15.080> as<00:03:15.230> I<00:03:15.320> said<00:03:15.350> on

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:15.620 
the information about that as I said on

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:17.770 
the information about that as I said on
the<00:03:15.740> product<00:03:16.040> page<00:03:16.070> but<00:03:16.730> as<00:03:16.820> i<00:03:16.910> said<00:03:16.940> i<00:03:17.210> plugged

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:17.780 
the product page but as i said i plugged

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:19.570 
the product page but as i said i plugged
in<00:03:17.930> with<00:03:18.050> all<00:03:18.200> the<00:03:18.230> peripherals<00:03:18.920> and<00:03:19.250> devices

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:19.580 
in with all the peripherals and devices

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:21.550 
in with all the peripherals and devices
i<00:03:19.670> wanted<00:03:20.090> to<00:03:20.180> plug<00:03:20.360> in<00:03:20.510> around<00:03:20.870> my<00:03:21.050> pc<00:03:21.440> and

i wanted to plug in around my pc and

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:23.560 
i wanted to plug in around my pc and
it's<00:03:22.070> fine<00:03:22.250> now<00:03:22.790> the<00:03:22.850> cable<00:03:23.209> that<00:03:23.300> comes<00:03:23.360> out

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:23.570 
it's fine now the cable that comes out

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:24.940 
it's fine now the cable that comes out
of<00:03:23.600> it<00:03:23.750> they<00:03:23.989> say<00:03:24.230> it's<00:03:24.440> around<00:03:24.590> about<00:03:24.650> 30

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:24.950 
of it they say it's around about 30

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:27.850 
of it they say it's around about 30
centimeters<00:03:25.280> with<00:03:26.030> yes<00:03:26.720> it's<00:03:27.170> about<00:03:27.410> that<00:03:27.620> and

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:27.860 
centimeters with yes it's about that and

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:30.370 
centimeters with yes it's about that and
probably<00:03:28.010> the<00:03:28.190> whole<00:03:28.250> device<00:03:28.520> as<00:03:28.700> well<00:03:29.080> so<00:03:30.080> if

and a mouse work fine so something worth

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:35.270 
my phone and accessed it that way and I

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:37.120 
my phone and accessed it that way and I
could<00:04:35.420> transfer<00:04:35.780> documents<00:04:36.290> on<00:04:36.440> and<00:04:36.710> off<00:04:36.830> and

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:37.130 
could transfer documents on and off and

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:38.770 
could transfer documents on and off and

power consumptions if they're not

power consumptions if they're not
externally<00:05:08.360> powered<00:05:08.390> and<00:05:08.720> in<00:05:08.780> fact<00:05:08.900> I've<00:05:09.080> had

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:09.410 
externally powered and in fact I've had

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:10.990 
externally powered and in fact I've had
problems<00:05:09.560> with<00:05:09.800> external<00:05:10.070> powered<00:05:10.490> USB<00:05:10.610> hubs

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:11.000 
problems with external powered USB hubs

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.460 
problems with external powered USB hubs
it<00:05:11.120> seems<00:05:11.390> USB<00:05:11.750> hubs<00:05:11.900> and<00:05:12.050> me<00:05:12.110> don't<00:05:12.260> get<00:05:12.410> along

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:12.470 
it seems USB hubs and me don't get along

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:13.900 
it seems USB hubs and me don't get along
but<00:05:13.070> it's<00:05:13.220> the<00:05:13.310> first<00:05:13.520> one<00:05:13.670> that<00:05:13.700> I've<00:05:13.850> been

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:13.910 
but it's the first one that I've been

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:16.000 
but it's the first one that I've been
able<00:05:14.030> to<00:05:14.120> plug<00:05:14.330> in<00:05:14.510> and<00:05:14.720> it<00:05:15.080> works<00:05:15.290> really<00:05:15.710> nice

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:16.010 
able to plug in and it works really nice

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:18.640 
able to plug in and it works really nice
and<00:05:16.190> easily<00:05:16.280> plus<00:05:16.940> i<00:05:17.300> think<00:05:18.260> for<00:05:18.350> its<00:05:18.470> price

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:18.650 
and easily plus i think for its price

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:21.070 
and easily plus i think for its price
which<00:05:18.950> is<00:05:18.980> 12<00:05:19.460> pounds<00:05:19.970> and<00:05:20.150> ninety<00:05:20.510> nine<00:05:20.690> pence

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:21.080 
which is 12 pounds and ninety nine pence

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:23.470 
which is 12 pounds and ninety nine pence
so<00:05:21.380> 13<00:05:21.770> pounds<00:05:22.220> i<00:05:22.340> think<00:05:22.790> that's<00:05:23.000> pretty<00:05:23.210> darn

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:23.480 
so 13 pounds i think that's pretty darn

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:24.910 
so 13 pounds i think that's pretty darn
reasonable<00:05:23.900> considering<00:05:24.470> it<00:05:24.590> comes<00:05:24.770> with

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:24.920 
reasonable considering it comes with

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:27.250 
reasonable considering it comes with
that<00:05:25.010> adapter<00:05:25.490> and<00:05:25.700> you<00:05:26.540> know<00:05:26.660> it<00:05:26.810> they're

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:27.260 
that adapter and you know it they're

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:29.170 
that adapter and you know it they're
saying<00:05:27.470> it's<00:05:27.620> high<00:05:27.740> quality<00:05:27.770> I<00:05:28.370> do<00:05:28.670> like<00:05:28.940> kind

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:29.180 
saying it's high quality I do like kind

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:31.090 
saying it's high quality I do like kind
