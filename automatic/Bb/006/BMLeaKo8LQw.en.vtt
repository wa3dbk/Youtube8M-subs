Reapers or Chris lives they're
completely<00:00:50.260> useless<00:00:50.380> in<00:00:50.890> multiplayer<00:00:51.220> same

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:51.670 
completely useless in multiplayer same

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:53.010 
completely useless in multiplayer same
as<00:00:51.820> if<00:00:51.910> you<00:00:51.940> were<00:00:52.120> just<00:00:52.330> mind<00:00:52.540> control<00:00:52.870> them

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:53.020 
as if you were just mind control them

as if you were just mind control them
you<00:00:53.110> can't<00:00:53.320> really<00:00:53.530> do<00:00:53.680> anything<00:00:53.860> with<00:00:54.130> them

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.040 

which<00:00:57.340> is<00:00:57.370> unfortunate<00:00:58.030> because<00:00:58.059> me<00:00:58.690> versus

00:00:59.040 --> 00:00:59.050 
which is unfortunate because me versus

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:01.200 
which is unfortunate because me versus
guava<00:00:59.290> on<00:00:59.590> a<00:00:59.830> like<00:01:00.070> a<00:01:00.100> snake<00:01:00.670> man<00:01:00.700> terror

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:01.210 
guava on a like a snake man terror

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:03.049 
guava on a like a snake man terror
mation<00:01:01.600> would<00:01:01.720> use<00:01:01.900> the<00:01:02.080> fucking<00:01:02.530> awesome

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
mation would use the fucking awesome

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:06.330

massacre<00:01:04.059> of<00:01:04.089> everything<00:01:04.750> it<00:01:05.680> would<00:01:05.830> not<00:01:06.100> be

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:06.340 
massacre of everything it would not be

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:09.639 
massacre of everything it would not be
fun

00:01:09.639 --> 00:01:09.649

gosh oh he's gonna feeling like guys yet
yeah<00:01:13.170> I<00:01:13.200> think<00:01:13.259> this<00:01:13.469> is<00:01:13.649> this<00:01:14.009> is<00:01:14.219> what<00:01:14.460> my

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
yeah I think this is this is what my

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.770 
yeah I think this is this is what my
third<00:01:14.880> turn<00:01:15.119> yeah<00:01:17.000> well<00:01:18.000> you<00:01:18.180> started<00:01:18.539> moving

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
third turn yeah well you started moving

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.090 
third turn yeah well you started moving
closer<00:01:19.020> to<00:01:19.140> the<00:01:19.229> ship<00:01:19.530> so<00:01:19.680> it<00:01:19.770> started<00:01:19.979> getting

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
closer to the ship so it started getting

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.700 
closer to the ship so it started getting
harder<00:01:20.549> to<00:01:20.579> see<00:01:20.880> you<00:01:21.030> my<00:01:21.689> idea<00:01:21.960> was<00:01:22.020> to<00:01:22.289> edge<00:01:22.409> up

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
harder to see you my idea was to edge up

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.410 
harder to see you my idea was to edge up
take<00:01:23.070> a<00:01:23.100> couple<00:01:23.369> shots<00:01:23.460> downloads<00:01:24.179> and<00:01:24.299> then

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
take a couple shots downloads and then

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.029 
take a couple shots downloads and then
head<00:01:24.570> back<00:01:24.600> so<00:01:25.229> that<00:01:25.259> you<00:01:25.439> couldn't<00:01:25.619> see<00:01:25.890> my

00:01:26.029 --> 00:01:26.039 
head back so that you couldn't see my

00:01:26.039 --> 00:01:28.160 
head back so that you couldn't see my
guys<00:01:26.220> there's<00:01:26.640> two<00:01:26.880> guys<00:01:27.060> beside<00:01:27.509> that<00:01:27.720> person

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
guys there's two guys beside that person

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.940 
guys there's two guys beside that person
against<00:01:28.590> the<00:01:28.740> ship<00:01:28.799> that<00:01:28.950> you<00:01:29.130> can't<00:01:29.369> see<00:01:30.950> yeah

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950

i<00:03:15.430> also<00:03:16.430> had<00:03:16.670> one<00:03:16.850> big<00:03:17.060> advantage<00:03:17.360> is<00:03:17.570> that

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:18.020 
i also had one big advantage is that

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:19.960 
i also had one big advantage is that
like<00:03:18.260> guava<00:03:18.560> said<00:03:18.920> the<00:03:19.400> grenades<00:03:19.700> weren't

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:19.970 
like guava said the grenades weren't

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:21.670 
like guava said the grenades weren't
working<00:03:20.300> so<00:03:20.330> i<00:03:20.570> think<00:03:20.810> he<00:03:21.140> figured<00:03:21.350> it<00:03:21.590> out

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:21.680 
working so i think he figured it out

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:25.960 
working so i think he figured it out
after<00:03:21.920> this<00:03:22.310> turn<00:03:22.580> or<00:03:22.900> register<00:03:23.900> turn<00:03:24.200> yeah<00:03:24.970> so

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:25.970 
after this turn or register turn yeah so

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:28.600 
after this turn or register turn yeah so
if<00:03:26.210> he<00:03:26.360> had<00:03:26.600> he<00:03:26.870> could<00:03:27.050> have<00:03:27.170> blindly<00:03:28.010> the

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:28.610 
if he had he could have blindly the

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:31.180 
if he had he could have blindly the
throwing<00:03:29.180> grenades<00:03:29.360> up<00:03:29.840> here<00:03:30.080> and<00:03:30.530> you<00:03:31.160> know

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:31.190 
throwing grenades up here and you know

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:32.380 
throwing grenades up here and you know
that<00:03:31.400> would<00:03:31.490> have<00:03:31.580> been<00:03:31.640> hit-or-miss<00:03:31.850> pretty

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:32.390 
that would have been hit-or-miss pretty

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:34.800 
that would have been hit-or-miss pretty
bad<00:03:32.600> but<00:03:32.930> it<00:03:33.140> would<00:03:33.290> have<00:03:33.380> been<00:03:33.470> something

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:34.810 
bad but it would have been something

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:40.660
