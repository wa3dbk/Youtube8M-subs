feeling<00:02:08.140> it's<00:02:09.140> all<00:02:09.289> in<00:02:09.500> the<00:02:09.830> expression<00:02:10.399> and

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:10.610 
feeling it's all in the expression and

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:16.050 
feeling it's all in the expression and
the<00:02:10.759> rhythm<00:02:11.240> of<00:02:11.390> his<00:02:11.540> walk

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:16.060 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:19.920 

the<00:02:16.570> idea<00:02:16.870> is<00:02:16.960> to<00:02:17.110> find<00:02:17.460> these<00:02:18.460> moments<00:02:18.930> where

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:19.930 
the idea is to find these moments where

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:22.470 
the idea is to find these moments where
person<00:02:20.800> is<00:02:20.920> articulated<00:02:21.610> in<00:02:21.730> their<00:02:22.120> emotion

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480 
person is articulated in their emotion

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:26.460 
person is articulated in their emotion
in<00:02:22.600> their<00:02:22.810> appearance<00:02:24.390> so<00:02:25.390> it's<00:02:25.810> just<00:02:26.230> a<00:02:26.290> way

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:26.470 
in their appearance so it's just a way

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:30.620 
in their appearance so it's just a way
to<00:02:27.210> articulate<00:02:28.470> film<00:02:29.470> images<00:02:29.890> using

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 
to articulate film images using

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:33.630 
to articulate film images using
incredibly<00:02:31.770> antiquated<00:02:32.770> but<00:02:32.920> still

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:33.640

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:58.290 
my life welcome from the family of
painters<00:02:55.450> and<00:02:56.250> film<00:02:57.250> was<00:02:57.400> the<00:02:57.430> last<00:02:57.760> frontier

00:02:58.290 --> 00:02:58.300 
painters and film was the last frontier

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:01.620 
painters and film was the last frontier
so<00:02:58.660> it<00:02:59.080> was<00:02:59.260> really<00:02:59.610> an<00:03:00.610> instant<00:03:01.060> match<00:03:01.239> for<00:03:01.510> me

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:01.630 
so it was really an instant match for me

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:04.920 
so it was really an instant match for me
it's<00:03:02.350> a<00:03:02.440> way<00:03:02.560> to<00:03:02.890> make<00:03:03.489> paintings<00:03:04.360> come<00:03:04.630> alive

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:04.930 
it's a way to make paintings come alive

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:07.890 
it's a way to make paintings come alive
which<00:03:05.410> is<00:03:05.440> really<00:03:06.100> exciting<00:03:06.880> this<00:03:07.600> box

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:07.900 
which is really exciting this box

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:09.510 
which is really exciting this box
represents<00:03:08.260> the<00:03:08.680> entire<00:03:08.950> film<00:03:09.190> which<00:03:09.340> is<00:03:09.489> a

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:09.520 
represents the entire film which is a

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:12.840 
represents the entire film which is a
minute<00:03:09.970> and<00:03:10.090> change<00:03:11.020> and<00:03:11.650> then<00:03:11.770> 20<00:03:12.489> something

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:12.850 
minute and change and then 20 something

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:19.199 
minute and change and then 20 something
and<00:03:13.150> it's<00:03:14.610> probably<00:03:15.610> around<00:03:16.020> $1,500<00:03:17.820> and<00:03:18.820> it's

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:19.209 
and it's probably around $1,500 and it's

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:22.380 
and it's probably around $1,500 and it's
all<00:03:19.360> on<00:03:19.830> watercolor<00:03:20.830> paper<00:03:21.040> of<00:03:21.850> one<00:03:22.060> sort<00:03:22.299> or

all on watercolor paper of one sort or

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:24.130 
all on watercolor paper of one sort or
another

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:24.140 
another

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:26.980 
another
I'm<00:03:24.860> paid<00:03:25.160> as<00:03:25.310> if<00:03:25.430> I<00:03:25.550> were<00:03:25.700> you<00:03:26.270> know<00:03:26.390> a<00:03:26.569> regular

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:26.990 
I'm paid as if I were you know a regular

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:29.920 
I'm paid as if I were you know a regular
columnist<00:03:27.740> I<00:03:28.459> guess<00:03:29.000> public<00:03:29.540> junior-level

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:29.930 
columnist I guess public junior-level

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:31.900 
columnist I guess public junior-level
even<00:03:30.440> so<00:03:30.740> the<00:03:31.040> money<00:03:31.190> doesn't<00:03:31.430> it's<00:03:31.850> just

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:31.910 
even so the money doesn't it's just

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:37.600 
even so the money doesn't it's just
about<00:03:32.270> covers<00:03:33.819> the<00:03:34.819> rent<00:03:35.030> and<00:03:35.240> the<00:03:36.020> and<00:03:36.920> I<00:03:37.400> give

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:37.610 
about covers the rent and the and I give

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:39.130 
about covers the rent and the and I give
half<00:03:38.000> of<00:03:38.090> it<00:03:38.209> to<00:03:38.270> my<00:03:38.450> composer

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:39.140 
half of it to my composer

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:41.980 
half of it to my composer
so<00:03:39.319> it<00:03:40.160> actually<00:03:40.310> I<00:03:40.730> sort<00:03:41.060> of<00:03:41.120> lose<00:03:41.360> money<00:03:41.660> each

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:41.990 
so it actually I sort of lose money each

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:44.560 
so it actually I sort of lose money each
month<00:03:42.020> on<00:03:42.560> making<00:03:43.010> these<00:03:43.130> films<00:03:43.310> the<00:03:43.700> funds

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:44.570 
month on making these films the funds

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:47.250 
month on making these films the funds
are<00:03:44.720> very<00:03:44.959> visible<00:03:45.740> and<00:03:45.860> very<00:03:46.070> viewed<00:03:46.459> and

idea of evolving a language of images

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:41.530 
idea of evolving a language of images
that<00:04:39.380> isn't<00:04:40.220> necessarily<00:04:40.580> parallel<00:04:41.300> to<00:04:41.450> the

that isn't necessarily parallel to the
language<00:04:41.810> of<00:04:41.990> words<00:04:42.200> but<00:04:42.710> it's<00:04:43.520> something

00:04:43.659 --> 00:04:43.669 
language of words but it's something

00:04:43.669 --> 00:04:46.140 
language of words but it's something
different<00:04:44.210> something<00:04:44.419> unique<00:04:44.570> unto<00:04:45.110> itself

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:46.150 
different something unique unto itself

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:48.550 
different something unique unto itself
has<00:04:47.150> been<00:04:47.360> the<00:04:47.479> line<00:04:47.660> of<00:04:47.810> exploration<00:04:48.380> from

know this idea of trying to make these

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:56.290 
know this idea of trying to make these
short<00:04:53.419> films<00:04:53.870> that<00:04:54.500> the<00:04:55.280> palette<00:04:55.729> was<00:04:55.940> as<00:04:56.090> much

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:56.300 
short films that the palette was as much

00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:00.360 
short films that the palette was as much
of<00:04:56.620> emotions<00:04:57.620> and<00:04:57.860> memories<00:04:58.520> as<00:04:58.970> it<00:04:59.570> is<00:04:59.720> of

of emotions and memories as it is of
