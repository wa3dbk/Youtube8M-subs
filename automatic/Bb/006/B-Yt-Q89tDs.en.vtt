00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
looks mainly the same right not a big

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.220 
looks mainly the same right not a big
deal<00:00:43.670> but<00:00:44.670> it's<00:00:44.940> the<00:00:45.059> UI<00:00:45.210> that<00:00:45.480> really<00:00:45.989> really

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
deal but it's the UI that really really

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.520 
deal but it's the UI that really really
looks<00:00:46.440> different<00:00:46.829> so<00:00:47.309> you'll<00:00:47.700> see<00:00:47.960> not<00:00:48.960> quite

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
different versions and the apps wonder

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:18.380 
different versions and the apps wonder
if<00:01:17.549> that's<00:01:17.700> because<00:01:17.850> we're<00:01:18.060> using<00:01:18.210> different

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
if that's because we're using different

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.160 
if that's because we're using different
phones<00:01:18.720> I'm<00:01:18.930> not<00:01:19.080> sure<00:01:19.280> but<00:01:20.280> as<00:01:20.549> soon<00:01:20.820> as<00:01:20.909> you

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:21.170 
phones I'm not sure but as soon as you

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:23.929 
phones I'm not sure but as soon as you
tap<00:01:22.170> on<00:01:22.320> a<00:01:22.380> video<00:01:22.920> and<00:01:23.189> decide<00:01:23.369> to<00:01:23.549> watch<00:01:23.700> it

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
tap on a video and decide to watch it

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:25.340 
tap on a video and decide to watch it
that's<00:01:24.060> where<00:01:24.330> things<00:01:24.540> get<00:01:24.750> really<00:01:24.810> different

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
that's where things get really different

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:26.570 
that's where things get really different
so<00:01:25.470> on<00:01:25.590> the<00:01:25.680> old<00:01:25.799> version<00:01:25.920> it<00:01:26.220> immediately

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
so on the old version it immediately

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.789 
so on the old version it immediately
launches<00:01:26.970> the<00:01:27.090> video<00:01:27.330> in<00:01:27.630> wide<00:01:28.290> screen<00:01:28.439> mode
