I<00:00:23.580> just<00:00:24.580> assembled<00:00:25.119> it<00:00:25.210> and<00:00:25.300> I<00:00:25.360> cleaned<00:00:25.600> all

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:25.750 
I just assembled it and I cleaned all

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:31.290 
I just assembled it and I cleaned all
the<00:00:25.840> potting<00:00:26.170> material<00:00:26.290> out<00:00:27.330> and<00:00:30.000> they<00:00:31.000> turn

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:31.300 
the potting material out and they turn

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:35.640 
the potting material out and they turn
around<00:00:31.450> a<00:00:31.630> little<00:00:31.869> easier<00:00:32.140> to<00:00:32.230> say<00:00:34.410> I'll<00:00:35.410> point

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:35.650 
around a little easier to say I'll point

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:40.319 
around a little easier to say I'll point
out<00:00:35.860> a<00:00:35.920> few<00:00:36.010> things<00:00:38.640> all<00:00:39.640> right<00:00:39.790> this<00:00:40.180> right

00:00:40.319 --> 00:00:40.329 
out a few things all right this right

out a few things all right this right
here<00:00:40.930> I<00:00:41.970> had<00:00:42.970> a<00:00:43.000> problem<00:00:43.270> with<00:00:43.480> this<00:00:43.600> at<00:00:43.810> my

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:44.020 
here I had a problem with this at my

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:46.050 
here I had a problem with this at my
voltage<00:00:44.410> was<00:00:44.560> flickering<00:00:45.070> at<00:00:45.190> like<00:00:45.370> 14<00:00:45.820> and<00:00:46.030> a

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:46.060 
voltage was flickering at like 14 and a

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:48.480 
voltage was flickering at like 14 and a
half<00:00:46.120> going<00:00:46.510> to<00:00:46.660> fifteen<00:00:47.110> and<00:00:47.260> a<00:00:47.320> half<00:00:47.350> so<00:00:48.100> one

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:48.490 
half going to fifteen and a half so one

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:50.010 
half going to fifteen and a half so one
of<00:00:48.520> these<00:00:48.730> components<00:00:49.330> is<00:00:49.390> faulty<00:00:49.810> and<00:00:49.930> I'm

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:50.020 
of these components is faulty and I'm

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:51.830 
of these components is faulty and I'm
just<00:00:50.140> gonna<00:00:50.230> desolder<00:00:50.770> the<00:00:50.890> faulty<00:00:51.340> one<00:00:51.490> and

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
just gonna desolder the faulty one and

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.570 
just gonna desolder the faulty one and
soldering<00:00:52.840> a<00:00:52.960> new<00:00:53.140> one<00:00:53.320> and<00:00:54.070> I<00:00:54.220> should<00:00:54.370> be<00:00:54.430> good

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:54.580 
soldering a new one and I should be good

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:59.160 
soldering a new one and I should be good
to<00:00:54.700> go<00:00:55.470> this<00:00:56.470> is<00:00:56.530> a<00:00:56.740> transistor<00:00:57.340> right<00:00:57.640> here<00:00:58.170> if

00:00:59.160 --> 00:00:59.170 
to go this is a transistor right here if

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:01.680 
to go this is a transistor right here if
you<00:00:59.320> can<00:00:59.620> see<00:00:59.800> right<00:00:59.830> on<00:01:00.220> here<00:01:00.700> they<00:01:01.300> solder

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:01.690 
you can see right on here they solder

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:05.100 
you can see right on here they solder
the<00:01:02.020> tab<00:01:02.440> to<00:01:02.830> the<00:01:02.860> board<00:01:03.220> and<00:01:03.629> the<00:01:04.629> whole<00:01:04.780> board

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:05.110 
the tab to the board and the whole board

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:08.640 
the tab to the board and the whole board
is<00:01:05.290> glued<00:01:05.590> down<00:01:05.619> to<00:01:06.189> the<00:01:06.790> heatsink<00:01:07.150> plate<00:01:07.650> the

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:08.650 
is glued down to the heatsink plate the

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:10.620 
is glued down to the heatsink plate the
middle<00:01:08.979> tab<00:01:09.189> is<00:01:09.369> not<00:01:09.520> connected<00:01:10.030> because<00:01:10.330> the

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:10.630 
middle tab is not connected because the

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:12.810 
middle tab is not connected because the
I<00:01:11.020> mean<00:01:11.409> the<00:01:11.500> middle<00:01:11.770> pin<00:01:12.009> is<00:01:12.130> not<00:01:12.310> connected

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:12.820 
I mean the middle pin is not connected

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:18.360 
I mean the middle pin is not connected
because<00:01:13.270> the<00:01:13.600> tab<00:01:13.900> is<00:01:14.229> the<00:01:14.829> same<00:01:16.650> same<00:01:17.650> same<00:01:17.920> as

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:18.370 
because the tab is the same same same as

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:21.870 
because the tab is the same same same as
this<00:01:19.380> the<00:01:20.380> middle<00:01:20.740> lead<00:01:20.920> here<00:01:21.250> is<00:01:21.370> the<00:01:21.490> same<00:01:21.730> as

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:21.880 
this the middle lead here is the same as

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:23.730 
this the middle lead here is the same as
the<00:01:22.000> tap<00:01:22.210> so<00:01:22.810> that's<00:01:22.960> why<00:01:23.110> they<00:01:23.260> cut<00:01:23.440> that<00:01:23.560> off

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:23.740 
the tap so that's why they cut that off

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:25.080 
the tap so that's why they cut that off
because<00:01:23.890> they<00:01:24.100> soldered<00:01:24.460> that<00:01:24.610> to<00:01:24.760> the<00:01:24.850> board

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:25.090 
because they soldered that to the board

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:29.610 
because they soldered that to the board
and<00:01:26.340> two<00:01:27.340> leads<00:01:27.580> connected<00:01:28.030> here<00:01:28.350> that's<00:01:29.350> an

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:29.620 
and two leads connected here that's an

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:33.120 
and two leads connected here that's an
EM<00:01:29.850> JD<00:01:30.850> or<00:01:31.390> 4-h<00:01:32.110> 11

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:33.130 
EM JD or 4-h 11

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:37.500 
EM JD or 4-h 11
it's<00:01:33.550> an<00:01:33.700> NPN<00:01:34.360> transistor<00:01:36.120> this<00:01:37.120> is<00:01:37.270> just<00:01:37.420> a

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:37.510 
it's an NPN transistor this is just a

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:43.590 
it's an NPN transistor this is just a
regular<00:01:37.690> 400<00:01:38.530> 5<00:01:39.190> or<00:01:39.490> a<00:01:39.520> 407<00:01:40.510> diode<00:01:42.420> you<00:01:43.420> have<00:01:43.540> a

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:43.600 
regular 400 5 or a 407 diode you have a

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:47.070 
regular 400 5 or a 407 diode you have a
couple<00:01:43.870> little<00:01:44.080> capacitors<00:01:44.920> in<00:01:45.040> here<00:01:46.080> you

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:47.080 
couple little capacitors in here you

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:48.300 
couple little capacitors in here you
have<00:01:47.200> a<00:01:47.229> couple<00:01:47.380> of<00:01:47.590> transistors<00:01:48.130> you<00:01:48.220> have

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:48.310 
have a couple of transistors you have

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:52.350 
have a couple of transistors you have
one<00:01:48.460> here<00:01:49.770> which<00:01:50.770> is<00:01:50.799> a<00:01:51.010> NPN<00:01:51.940> and<00:01:52.210> then<00:01:52.299> you

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:52.360 
one here which is a NPN and then you

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:54.080 
one here which is a NPN and then you
have<00:01:52.450> another<00:01:52.510> one<00:01:52.750> here<00:01:52.930> which<00:01:52.990> is<00:01:53.110> a<00:01:53.229> PNP<00:01:53.590> and

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
have another one here which is a PNP and

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.430 
have another one here which is a PNP and
you<00:01:55.090> have<00:01:55.180> this<00:01:55.330> down<00:01:55.540> here<00:01:55.840> is<00:01:55.960> a<00:01:55.990> Zener<00:01:56.290> diode

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:56.440 
you have this down here is a Zener diode

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:59.899 
you have this down here is a Zener diode
as<00:01:56.920> a<00:01:56.950> six<00:01:57.280> point<00:01:57.549> two<00:01:57.729> volts<00:01:57.760> as<00:01:58.360> efore<00:01:58.869> on<00:01:59.049> it

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
as a six point two volts as efore on it

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:03.960 
as a six point two volts as efore on it
and<00:02:01.200> capacitor<00:02:02.200> here<00:02:02.560> so<00:02:03.159> it's<00:02:03.280> fairly<00:02:03.640> simple

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:03.970 
and capacitor here so it's fairly simple

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:06.990 
and capacitor here so it's fairly simple
circuit<00:02:04.450> not<00:02:05.260> too<00:02:05.470> much<00:02:05.650> to<00:02:05.799> go<00:02:05.920> wrong<00:02:05.950> so<00:02:06.880> I'm

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:07.000 
circuit not too much to go wrong so I'm

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.639 
circuit not too much to go wrong so I'm
going<00:02:07.119> to<00:02:07.180> put<00:02:07.510> my<00:02:07.600> component<00:02:08.140> tester<00:02:08.409> on<00:02:08.530> each

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:08.649 
going to put my component tester on each

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:10.889 
going to put my component tester on each
one<00:02:08.890> of<00:02:09.009> these<00:02:09.159> the<00:02:09.819> capacitors<00:02:10.450> are<00:02:10.599> likely

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:10.899 
one of these the capacitors are likely

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:12.630 
one of these the capacitors are likely
nothing<00:02:11.200> wrong<00:02:11.349> with<00:02:11.500> them<00:02:11.680> and<00:02:11.860> the<00:02:12.430> diode

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.640 
nothing wrong with them and the diode

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:15.509 
nothing wrong with them and the diode
was<00:02:12.909> probably<00:02:13.209> fine<00:02:13.920> more<00:02:14.920> than<00:02:15.069> likely<00:02:15.250> the

00:02:15.509 --> 00:02:15.519 
was probably fine more than likely the

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:18.030 
was probably fine more than likely the
Zener<00:02:15.760> is<00:02:15.909> bad<00:02:16.120> or<00:02:16.599> one<00:02:17.230> of<00:02:17.319> the<00:02:17.409> true<00:02:17.620> two

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
Zener is bad or one of the true two

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:20.550 
Zener is bad or one of the true two

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
transistors or the big one so I'm just

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.680 
transistors or the big one so I'm just
going<00:02:20.739> to<00:02:20.799> put<00:02:21.010> my<00:02:21.240> component<00:02:22.240> tester<00:02:22.569> and

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:22.690 
going to put my component tester and

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:25.110 
going to put my component tester and
check<00:02:22.840> it<00:02:22.959> out<00:02:23.140> change<00:02:24.099> the<00:02:24.280> component<00:02:24.819> put

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120 
check it out change the component put

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:27.290 
check it out change the component put
the<00:02:25.240> cover<00:02:25.420> back<00:02:25.510> on<00:02:25.870> I'll<00:02:26.110> be<00:02:26.230> good<00:02:26.349> to<00:02:26.500> go

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300 
the cover back on I'll be good to go

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:31.740 
the cover back on I'll be good to go
but<00:02:28.300> now<00:02:28.480> you<00:02:28.540> can<00:02:28.750> see<00:02:28.780> with<00:02:29.050> the<00:02:29.200> inside<00:02:29.680> of<00:02:30.750> a

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
but now you can see with the inside of a

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:34.200 
but now you can see with the inside of a
voltage<00:02:32.080> regulator<00:02:32.410> on<00:02:32.710> 10<00:02:33.070> si<00:02:33.430> and<00:02:33.700> 12<00:02:33.940> si

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:34.210 
voltage regulator on 10 si and 12 si

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:36.630 
voltage regulator on 10 si and 12 si
looks<00:02:34.450> like
