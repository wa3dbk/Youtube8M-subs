00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.649
 new clog 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.780
 the truth is that one day I was very 

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:14.010
 boring let's say I cut myself I do not know if I 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.380
 like I hope 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:19.250
 and so I'll be for a little while to see 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:22.650
 how it's going to take me is very fast so 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:25.050
 in a week we no longer have it so 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:28.220
 Well, it started and I liked it 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:30.650
 see them see you at the end of the video 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:32.390
 these are the materials that we are going to 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:36.710
 need 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:40.560
 we need black thread and needle scissors 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:43.670
 black felt white felt and wadding or 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:46.700
 filling for our pads 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:48.020
 and we start with our video what 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:49.909
 first thing we're going to do is cut 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:52.369
 our felt in half and we're going to 

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:53.930
 put science and half of each other and 

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:56.240
 then let's grab the needle with 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:58.640
 pretty black thread and we're going to start 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:00.560
 sew the edge of our pillows 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:03.500
 we start around a corner and go 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:06.350
 taking the whole shore and in need of 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:08.710
 Catherine and we are going to cook everything 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:08.710
 our america 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:19.540
 once I have reached this point 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:21.879
 where you only have about 5 centimeters 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:23.560
 before sewing there you will stop sewing 

00:02:21.879 --> 00:02:25.150
 but you will not remove the thread what 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:28.540
 next is that we are going to add all the 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:31.030
 Wadding or filling to our pillow 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:33.459
 you have to leave it very fluffy to 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:38.489
 that is better and a better grip 

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:38.489
 way so you stuff them very well 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:41.840
 once you've finished something like that 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:43.880
 nothing else we are going to pull a little 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:46.400
 our thread and we will continue 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:49.489
 doing our pad 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:51.830
 you take the ends of our fabrics and 

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:53.720
 you start sewing again 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:56.950
 closes very well so you do not go to 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:56.950
 leave the filling too 

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:04.720
 since we have finished the only thing 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:06.430
 let's do is the remaining thread what 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:10.590
 we are going to cut and we are going to make a 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:10.590
 knot to the corner of our pillow 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:16.180
 and we cut the excess after we 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:18.040
 There were a little bit of white stuff left 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:21.130
 because we are going to take to make it look 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:23.590
 very black our felt 

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:25.000
 and we will have something like that then what 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:28.660
 next thing to do is take our 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:31.630
 white felt a pen or pencil and let's go 

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:33.810
 to draw the letters of the debt there to 

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:37.000
 it made me so much easier 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:38.860
 cut them off like that of the fabric with the 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.200
 scissors nothing else so let's go the 

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:43.570
 cut out like this and then I put them in the 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:46.390
 order and I started to paste them with a 

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:47.950
 I resist the white with silicone is a 

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:49.510
 little harder but you can also 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:52.300
 but it worked for me the most 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:55.170
 it resisted white and that's how it was hitting lyrics 

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:55.170
 by letter by letter 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:11.299
 once I 'm finished I 'm left with something 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:12.769
 well the truth to me super taste but 

00:04:11.299 --> 00:04:15.079
 He already tells me how everything is here 

00:04:12.769 --> 00:04:17.449
 then he decides to make one of it with the 

00:04:15.079 --> 00:04:19.639
 letter of him and the truth this was my 

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:22.340
 favorite I loved nothing but the one that 

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:24.380
 the letter of l and cut the filter and it 

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:27.080
