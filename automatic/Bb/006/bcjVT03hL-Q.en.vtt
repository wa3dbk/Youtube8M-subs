00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:33.140 
smallest dab and then another thing i
really<00:03:31.380> like<00:03:31.710> is<00:03:31.950> that<00:03:31.980> it's<00:03:32.310> very<00:03:32.400> sanitary

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.150 
really like is that it's very sanitary

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:34.640

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:34.650 
because it just comes out of this little

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:37.130 
because it just comes out of this little
tube<00:03:35.160> here<00:03:35.610> so<00:03:36.270> you're<00:03:36.450> not<00:03:36.570> dipping<00:03:36.930> your

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:37.140

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:40.830 
you're using that on blemishes that

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:44.030

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:05.970 
shade vanilla I'm not gonna lie i wasn't

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:08.210 
shade vanilla I'm not gonna lie i wasn't
even<00:04:06.000> color<00:04:06.390> match<00:04:06.660> to<00:04:06.900> this<00:04:07.050> i<00:04:07.260> just<00:04:07.470> grabbed

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:08.220 
even color match to this i just grabbed

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:09.440 
even color match to this i just grabbed
it<00:04:08.370> because<00:04:08.640> it<00:04:08.790> looked<00:04:08.940> like<00:04:09.030> it<00:04:09.180> would<00:04:09.270> be

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:09.450 
it because it looked like it would be

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:12.020 
it because it looked like it would be
the<00:04:09.630> right<00:04:09.780> shade<00:04:10.170> this<00:04:10.980> is<00:04:11.130> much<00:04:11.490> much<00:04:11.730> paler

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:12.030 
the right shade this is much much paler

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:13.550 
the right shade this is much much paler
than<00:04:12.209> the<00:04:12.450> other<00:04:12.600> one<00:04:12.810> as<00:04:12.930> you<00:04:13.050> can<00:04:13.200> see<00:04:13.380> so

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:13.560 
than the other one as you can see so

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:15.170 
than the other one as you can see so
this<00:04:13.680> will<00:04:13.860> probably<00:04:14.070> be<00:04:14.310> friendlier<00:04:14.850> for<00:04:15.090> the

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:15.180 
this will probably be friendlier for the

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:17.840 
this will probably be friendlier for the
summer<00:04:15.390> or<00:04:15.690> winter<00:04:15.750> months<00:04:16.470> because<00:04:17.310> this<00:04:17.700> is

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:17.850 
summer or winter months because this is

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:18.090 
summer or winter months because this is
a

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:18.100
