now<00:00:06.390> I<00:00:06.690> made<00:00:07.200> this<00:00:07.500> method<00:00:08.010> easy<00:00:08.250> enough<00:00:08.519> so

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:08.970 
now I made this method easy enough so

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.080 
now I made this method easy enough so
that<00:00:09.000> whenever<00:00:09.960> you're<00:00:10.469> solving<00:00:10.740> one<00:00:11.670> of<00:00:11.940> the

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
that whenever you're solving one of the

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:13.580 
that whenever you're solving one of the
seven<00:00:12.420> different<00:00:12.599> patterns<00:00:13.200> of<00:00:13.380> yellow

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
seven different patterns of yellow

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:16.099 
seven different patterns of yellow
stickers<00:00:14.070> on<00:00:14.340> the<00:00:14.549> cube<00:00:14.820> you<00:00:15.630> will<00:00:15.809> always

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
stickers on the cube you will always

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:19.730 
stickers on the cube you will always
start<00:00:16.619> with<00:00:16.949> the<00:00:17.550> right<00:00:18.180> fish<00:00:18.570> algorithm<00:00:19.350> so

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
start with the right fish algorithm so

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.710 
start with the right fish algorithm so
in<00:00:20.300> this<00:00:21.300> case<00:00:21.630> of<00:00:21.960> yellow<00:00:22.560> stickers<00:00:23.720> you'll

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
in this case of yellow stickers you'll

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.710 
in this case of yellow stickers you'll
see<00:00:24.930> this<00:00:25.140> pattern<00:00:25.380> with<00:00:25.980> the<00:00:26.010> sticker<00:00:26.480> on<00:00:27.480> the

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
see this pattern with the sticker on the

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.700 
see this pattern with the sticker on the
left<00:00:27.930> side<00:00:28.109> and<00:00:28.410> on<00:00:28.890> the<00:00:28.949> right<00:00:29.220> side<00:00:29.519> now<00:00:30.710> to

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
left side and on the right side now to

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.400 
left side and on the right side now to
solve<00:00:31.949> this<00:00:32.279> pattern<00:00:33.079> you're<00:00:34.079> going<00:00:34.200> to<00:00:34.260> take

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
solve this pattern you're going to take

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.380 
solve this pattern you're going to take
the<00:00:34.559> cube<00:00:34.890> and<00:00:35.100> you're<00:00:35.850> going<00:00:36.000> to<00:00:36.059> look<00:00:36.149> at<00:00:36.300> the

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
the cube and you're going to look at the

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.299 
the cube and you're going to look at the
right<00:00:36.570> sticker<00:00:36.870> and<00:00:37.170> make<00:00:37.530> sure<00:00:37.680> that<00:00:37.980> sticker

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
right sticker and make sure that sticker

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:41.860 
right sticker and make sure that sticker
is<00:00:38.550> facing<00:00:39.000> you<00:00:39.149> and<00:00:39.680> like<00:00:40.680> I<00:00:40.710> said<00:00:40.890> every

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:41.870 
is facing you and like I said every

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:44.360 
is facing you and like I said every
every<00:00:42.870> pattern<00:00:43.110> you'll<00:00:43.410> see<00:00:43.620> you'll<00:00:43.890> always

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
every pattern you'll see you'll always

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.029 
every pattern you'll see you'll always
start<00:00:45.090> off<00:00:45.239> with<00:00:45.600> the<00:00:45.719> right<00:00:45.930> fish<00:00:46.230> algorithm

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
start off with the right fish algorithm

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:54.910 
start off with the right fish algorithm
so<00:00:47.700> you're<00:00:48.570> going<00:00:48.690> to<00:00:48.750> do<00:00:48.899> are<00:00:49.910> you<00:00:51.199> are<00:00:52.199> I<00:00:53.480> you

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:54.920 
so you're going to do are you are I you

00:00:54.920 --> 00:01:00.830 
so you're going to do are you are I you
are<00:00:56.180> you<00:00:57.180> two<00:00:57.449> all<00:00:58.230> right<00:00:58.289> and<00:00:59.539> what<00:01:00.539> that<00:01:00.719> will

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
are you two all right and what that will

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.569 
are you two all right and what that will
do<00:01:01.020> is<00:01:01.050> give<00:01:01.350> you<00:01:01.620> the<00:01:01.770> fish<00:01:01.949> pattern<00:01:02.219> and

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
do is give you the fish pattern and

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.179 
do is give you the fish pattern and
solve<00:01:03.420> that<00:01:03.570> fish<00:01:03.870> and<00:01:04.199> all<00:01:04.769> you<00:01:04.860> have<00:01:04.979> to<00:01:05.070> do

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
solve that fish and all you have to do

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.820 
solve that fish and all you have to do
solve<00:01:05.460> that<00:01:05.580> fish<00:01:05.820> now<00:01:06.030> so<00:01:06.420> you<00:01:07.409> look<00:01:07.590> for

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
solve that fish now so you look for

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.570 
solve that fish now so you look for
which<00:01:08.600> which<00:01:09.600> side<00:01:10.320> the<00:01:10.560> yellow<00:01:10.979> stickers<00:01:11.369> on

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
which which side the yellow stickers on

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.820 
which which side the yellow stickers on
and<00:01:11.820> on<00:01:12.299> this<00:01:12.479> case<00:01:12.810> it's<00:01:13.140> on<00:01:13.290> the<00:01:13.409> right<00:01:13.560> side

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
and on this case it's on the right side

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.820 
and on this case it's on the right side
or<00:01:13.950> left<00:01:14.040> side<00:01:14.900> take<00:01:15.900> that<00:01:15.930> sticker<00:01:16.380> make<00:01:16.680> sure

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
or left side take that sticker make sure

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.460 
or left side take that sticker make sure
it's<00:01:16.979> facing<00:01:17.159> me<00:01:17.549> and<00:01:17.759> do<00:01:18.600> the<00:01:18.780> left<00:01:19.020> fish

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
it's facing me and do the left fish

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:25.870 
it's facing me and do the left fish
algorithm<00:01:20.340> you're<00:01:21.299> going<00:01:21.420> to<00:01:21.509> do<00:01:22.189> Li<00:01:23.189> you<00:01:23.909> I<00:01:24.740> l

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
yellow stickers now on this case on this

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.090 
yellow stickers now on this case on this
pattern<00:01:42.150> the<00:01:42.630> stickers<00:01:43.049> are<00:01:43.259> on<00:01:43.710> the<00:01:43.799> front

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
pattern the stickers are on the front

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.289 
pattern the stickers are on the front
now<00:01:44.310> and<00:01:45.110> to<00:01:46.110> solve<00:01:46.350> this<00:01:47.119> you're<00:01:48.119> going<00:01:48.240> to

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
now and to solve this you're going to

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:49.760 
now and to solve this you're going to
take<00:01:48.420> that<00:01:48.450> cube<00:01:48.899> and<00:01:49.110> make<00:01:49.350> sure<00:01:49.530> those<00:01:49.710> two

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
take that cube and make sure those two

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.749 
take that cube and make sure those two
stickers<00:01:50.460> are<00:01:50.850> facing<00:01:51.479> you<00:01:51.630> so<00:01:52.549> like<00:01:53.549> I<00:01:53.579> said

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
stickers are facing you so like I said

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:55.999 
stickers are facing you so like I said
for<00:01:54.329> every<00:01:54.360> pattern<00:01:54.990> you'll<00:01:55.470> always<00:01:55.799> start

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
for every pattern you'll always start

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:57.920 
for every pattern you'll always start
with<00:01:56.100> the<00:01:56.310> right<00:01:56.490> sticker<00:01:56.909> or<00:01:57.240> with<00:01:57.600> the<00:01:57.719> right

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
with the right sticker or with the right

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:02.289 
with the right sticker or with the right
fish<00:01:58.909> algorithm<00:01:59.909> so<00:02:00.180> we're<00:02:00.270> going<00:02:00.360> to<00:02:00.450> do<00:02:01.100> are

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:02.299 
fish algorithm so we're going to do are

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:08.109 
fish algorithm so we're going to do are
you<00:02:03.500> are<00:02:04.500> I<00:02:04.880> you<00:02:06.079> are

00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:08.119 
you are I you are

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:12.070 
you are I you are
to<00:02:08.619> all<00:02:09.619> right<00:02:10.209> so<00:02:11.209> and<00:02:11.480> that<00:02:11.659> should<00:02:11.840> give<00:02:11.989> you

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:12.080 
to all right so and that should give you

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:14.500 
to all right so and that should give you
a<00:02:12.170> fish<00:02:12.349> pattern<00:02:12.650> and<00:02:13.120> you<00:02:14.120> just<00:02:14.239> have<00:02:14.420> to

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.510 
a fish pattern and you just have to

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:17.649 
a fish pattern and you just have to
solve<00:02:14.750> that<00:02:14.840> fish<00:02:15.080> pattern<00:02:15.379> so<00:02:16.390> you<00:02:17.390> look<00:02:17.569> at

00:02:17.649 --> 00:02:17.659 
solve that fish pattern so you look at

00:02:17.659 --> 00:02:19.690 
solve that fish pattern so you look at
that<00:02:17.810> fish<00:02:18.049> pattern<00:02:18.319> you<00:02:18.680> look<00:02:18.830> for<00:02:19.069> which

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:19.700 
that fish pattern you look for which

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:21.610 
that fish pattern you look for which
side<00:02:19.940> the<00:02:20.209> yellow<00:02:20.450> stickers<00:02:20.840> on<00:02:21.049> and<00:02:21.290> in<00:02:21.409> this

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 
side the yellow stickers on and in this

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:24.190 
side the yellow stickers on and in this
case<00:02:21.860> is<00:02:22.129> on<00:02:22.280> the<00:02:22.400> left<00:02:22.580> side<00:02:22.900> you<00:02:23.900> face<00:02:24.170> that

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.200 
case is on the left side you face that

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:27.520 
case is on the left side you face that
sticker<00:02:24.769> and<00:02:25.129> you<00:02:25.819> do<00:02:26.000> the<00:02:26.239> left<00:02:26.530> fish

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:27.530 
sticker and you do the left fish

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:29.890 
sticker and you do the left fish
algorithm<00:02:28.370> again<00:02:28.790> so<00:02:29.269> we're<00:02:29.360> going<00:02:29.450> to<00:02:29.569> do<00:02:29.659> a

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:29.900 
algorithm again so we're going to do a

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:39.729 
algorithm again so we're going to do a
lie<00:02:30.769> you<00:02:31.099> I<00:02:32.079> el<00:02:33.310> you<00:02:34.310> I<00:02:34.870> li<00:02:35.870> you<00:02:36.860> to<00:02:37.239> l<00:02:38.239> and<00:02:38.739> that

00:02:39.729 --> 00:02:39.739 
lie you I el you I li you to l and that

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:44.319 
lie you I el you I li you to l and that
should<00:02:40.129> solve<00:02:40.370> three<00:02:41.180> yellow<00:02:41.420> stickers<00:02:43.329> now

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:44.329 
should solve three yellow stickers now

00:02:44.329 --> 00:02:47.530 
should solve three yellow stickers now
this<00:02:44.840> next<00:02:45.290> set<00:02:45.680> of<00:02:45.859> two<00:02:46.459> different<00:02:46.940> patterns

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:47.540 
this next set of two different patterns

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:50.410 
this next set of two different patterns
will<00:02:48.290> just<00:02:48.590> be<00:02:48.769> across<00:02:49.099> but<00:02:50.060> the<00:02:50.209> yellow

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:50.420 
will just be across but the yellow

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:52.059 
will just be across but the yellow
stickers<00:02:50.870> are<00:02:51.140> going<00:02:51.319> to<00:02:51.379> be<00:02:51.500> placed<00:02:51.799> on

00:02:52.059 --> 00:02:52.069 
stickers are going to be placed on

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:57.430 
stickers are going to be placed on
different<00:02:52.430> spot<00:02:52.700> so<00:02:54.549> to<00:02:55.549> solve<00:02:55.790> this<00:02:56.440> this

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:57.440 
different spot so to solve this this

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:01.839 
different spot so to solve this this
cross<00:02:58.220> this<00:02:58.760> pattern<00:02:59.269> of<00:02:59.510> cross<00:03:00.700> you're<00:03:01.700> going

00:03:01.839 --> 00:03:01.849 
cross this pattern of cross you're going

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:03.369 
cross this pattern of cross you're going
to<00:03:01.940> look<00:03:02.030> at<00:03:02.150> the<00:03:02.269> stickers<00:03:02.690> and<00:03:02.930> you're<00:03:03.260> going

00:03:03.369 --> 00:03:03.379 
to look at the stickers and you're going

00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:06.309 
to look at the stickers and you're going
to<00:03:03.440> determine<00:03:03.769> and<00:03:04.840> you're<00:03:05.840> going<00:03:05.959> to<00:03:06.019> look<00:03:06.140> at

00:03:06.309 --> 00:03:06.319 
to determine and you're going to look at

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:08.860 
to determine and you're going to look at
it<00:03:06.500> and<00:03:06.650> you'll<00:03:07.220> see<00:03:07.489> these<00:03:08.239> two<00:03:08.540> stickers

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:08.870 
it and you'll see these two stickers

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:13.180 
it and you'll see these two stickers
right<00:03:09.530> here<00:03:09.859> and<00:03:11.590> another<00:03:12.590> two<00:03:12.919> stickers

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:13.190 
right here and another two stickers

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:16.629 
right here and another two stickers
right<00:03:13.609> behind<00:03:14.540> it<00:03:14.750> so<00:03:14.959> two<00:03:15.829> stickers<00:03:16.099> are<00:03:16.400> here

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:16.639 
right behind it so two stickers are here

00:03:16.639 --> 00:03:20.920 
right behind it so two stickers are here
to<00:03:17.090> stickers<00:03:17.480> are<00:03:17.630> here<00:03:17.840> and<00:03:19.480> to<00:03:20.480> hold<00:03:20.690> that

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:20.930 
to stickers are here and to hold that

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:23.080 
to stickers are here and to hold that
cube<00:03:21.290> to<00:03:21.500> solve<00:03:21.769> it<00:03:21.950> you're<00:03:22.549> going<00:03:22.700> to<00:03:22.790> hold<00:03:22.910> it

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:23.090 
cube to solve it you're going to hold it

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:25.240 
cube to solve it you're going to hold it
so<00:03:23.269> that<00:03:23.450> this<00:03:23.690> two<00:03:23.930> stickers<00:03:24.230> are<00:03:24.590> facing<00:03:25.069> to

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:25.250 
so that this two stickers are facing to

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:27.640 
so that this two stickers are facing to
the<00:03:25.310> left<00:03:25.400> and<00:03:25.910> the<00:03:25.940> other<00:03:26.540> two<00:03:27.019> stickers<00:03:27.379> are

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:27.650 
the left and the other two stickers are

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:29.650 
the left and the other two stickers are
facing<00:03:28.040> to<00:03:28.160> the<00:03:28.190> right<00:03:28.310> and<00:03:28.669> like<00:03:29.480> I<00:03:29.599> said

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:29.660 
facing to the right and like I said

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:31.420 
facing to the right and like I said
you're<00:03:30.109> always<00:03:30.169> going<00:03:30.680> to<00:03:30.739> start<00:03:31.010> off<00:03:31.129> with

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:31.430 
you're always going to start off with

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:33.909 
you're always going to start off with
the<00:03:31.579> right<00:03:31.790> fish<00:03:32.060> algorithm<00:03:32.810> so<00:03:33.650> you're<00:03:33.829> going

00:03:33.909 --> 00:03:33.919 
the right fish algorithm so you're going

00:03:33.919 --> 00:03:41.470 
the right fish algorithm so you're going
to<00:03:33.980> do<00:03:34.129> are<00:03:35.290> you<00:03:36.609> all<00:03:37.609> right<00:03:37.970> you<00:03:38.959> are<00:03:40.090> you<00:03:41.090> two

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:41.480 
to do are you all right you are you two

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:44.800 
to do are you all right you are you two
all<00:03:42.079> right<00:03:42.340> and<00:03:43.340> that<00:03:44.269> should<00:03:44.419> give<00:03:44.629> you<00:03:44.780> a

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:44.810 
all right and that should give you a

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:46.869 
all right and that should give you a
fish<00:03:45.410> pattern<00:03:45.709> you're<00:03:46.310> going<00:03:46.459> to<00:03:46.549> solve<00:03:46.730> that

00:03:46.869 --> 00:03:46.879 
fish pattern you're going to solve that

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:49.479 
fish pattern you're going to solve that
fish<00:03:47.199> you<00:03:48.199> look<00:03:48.379> where<00:03:48.709> the<00:03:48.949> yellow<00:03:49.220> sticker

00:03:49.479 --> 00:03:49.489 
fish you look where the yellow sticker

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:51.849 
fish you look where the yellow sticker
is<00:03:49.730> this<00:03:50.449> case<00:03:50.690> it's<00:03:50.930> on<00:03:51.049> the<00:03:51.169> right<00:03:51.349> side<00:03:51.620> you

00:03:51.849 --> 00:03:51.859 
is this case it's on the right side you

00:03:51.859 --> 00:03:55.930 
is this case it's on the right side you
take<00:03:52.280> that<00:03:52.639> fit<00:03:53.449> or<00:03:53.690> that<00:03:53.989> sticker<00:03:54.579> face<00:03:55.579> it<00:03:55.819> to

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:55.940 
take that fit or that sticker face it to

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:58.420 
take that fit or that sticker face it to
you<00:03:56.120> and<00:03:56.510> you<00:03:56.989> do<00:03:57.139> the<00:03:57.290> right<00:03:57.470> fish<00:03:57.739> algorithm

00:03:58.420 --> 00:03:58.430 
you and you do the right fish algorithm

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:04.740 
you and you do the right fish algorithm
again<00:03:58.910> when<00:03:59.660> you<00:03:59.750> do<00:03:59.930> are<00:04:00.310> you<00:04:01.359> are<00:04:02.359> I<00:04:02.620> you<00:04:03.620> are

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:04.750 
again when you do are you are I you are

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:11.000 
again when you do are you are I you are
you<00:04:05.750> two<00:04:05.980> alright<00:04:06.980> and<00:04:07.819> that<00:04:08.480> should<00:04:08.690> solve<00:04:08.870> it

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:11.010 
you two alright and that should solve it

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:15.750 
you two alright and that should solve it
now<00:04:12.010> on<00:04:12.340> this<00:04:12.760> case<00:04:13.290> you'll<00:04:14.290> find<00:04:14.710> that<00:04:15.370> there

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:15.760 
now on this case you'll find that there

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:18.990 
now on this case you'll find that there
will<00:04:15.910> be<00:04:15.940> two<00:04:16.390> stickers<00:04:16.690> right<00:04:17.019> here<00:04:17.380> and<00:04:18.000> two

00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:19.000 
will be two stickers right here and two

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.230 
will be two stickers right here and two
side<00:04:19.750> stickers<00:04:20.320> like<00:04:20.590> left<00:04:21.160> on<00:04:21.370> the<00:04:21.850> left<00:04:22.000> side

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:22.240 
side stickers like left on the left side

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:24.570 
side stickers like left on the left side
and<00:04:22.480> on<00:04:22.600> the<00:04:22.660> right<00:04:22.870> side<00:04:23.140> so<00:04:23.800> two<00:04:24.250> stickers

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:24.580 
and on the right side so two stickers

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:28.320 
and on the right side so two stickers
are<00:04:24.940> here<00:04:25.240> in<00:04:25.390> one<00:04:26.170> right<00:04:26.350> here<00:04:26.740> and<00:04:26.890> one<00:04:27.370> right

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:28.330 
are here in one right here and one right

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:32.340 
are here in one right here and one right
here<00:04:28.600> and<00:04:29.640> to<00:04:30.640> hold<00:04:30.910> this<00:04:31.240> cube<00:04:31.630> and<00:04:31.900> solve<00:04:32.170> it

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:32.350 
here and to hold this cube and solve it

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:34.890 
here and to hold this cube and solve it
you<00:04:32.890> take<00:04:33.160> those<00:04:33.340> two<00:04:33.670> stickers<00:04:33.970> that<00:04:34.360> face

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:34.900 
you take those two stickers that face

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:37.140 
you take those two stickers that face
the<00:04:35.080> same<00:04:35.290> way<00:04:35.530> and<00:04:35.830> you're<00:04:36.700> going<00:04:36.850> to<00:04:36.940> hold

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:37.150 
the same way and you're going to hold

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:41.250 
the same way and you're going to hold
that<00:04:37.270> away<00:04:37.780> from<00:04:37.840> you<00:04:38.700> so<00:04:39.700> that<00:04:39.960> it's<00:04:40.960> away

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:41.260 
that away from you so that it's away

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:43.050 
that away from you so that it's away
from<00:04:41.290> you<00:04:41.590> those<00:04:41.890> two<00:04:42.070> seconds<00:04:42.460> away<00:04:42.580> from<00:04:42.730> you

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:43.060 
from you those two seconds away from you

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:45.000 
from you those two seconds away from you
and<00:04:43.270> you're<00:04:44.140> going<00:04:44.230> to<00:04:44.290> do<00:04:44.500> the<00:04:44.650> right<00:04:44.770> fish

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:45.010 
and you're going to do the right fish

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:47.010 
and you're going to do the right fish
algorithm<00:04:45.670> first<00:04:45.910> like<00:04:46.240> I<00:04:46.390> said<00:04:46.450> so<00:04:46.870> you're

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:47.020 
algorithm first like I said so you're

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:53.040 
algorithm first like I said so you're
going<00:04:47.110> to<00:04:47.170> do<00:04:47.320> are<00:04:47.790> you<00:04:48.840> are<00:04:49.840> I<00:04:50.310> you<00:04:51.310> are<00:04:52.050> you

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:53.050 
going to do are you are I you are you

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:55.890 
going to do are you are I you are you
two<00:04:53.290> all<00:04:53.560> right<00:04:53.620> and<00:04:54.400> that<00:04:55.330> will<00:04:55.480> give<00:04:55.660> you<00:04:55.810> a

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:55.900 
two all right and that will give you a

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:57.600 
two all right and that will give you a
fish<00:04:56.080> pattern<00:04:56.380> and<00:04:56.770> you're<00:04:57.250> going<00:04:57.340> to<00:04:57.400> solve

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:57.610 
fish pattern and you're going to solve

00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:59.790 
fish pattern and you're going to solve
that<00:04:57.730> fish<00:04:58.030> the<00:04:58.930> yellow<00:04:59.140> stickers<00:04:59.560> on<00:04:59.710> the

00:04:59.790 --> 00:04:59.800 
that fish the yellow stickers on the

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:03.450 
that fish the yellow stickers on the
right<00:04:59.980> side<00:05:00.220> so<00:05:00.520> take<00:05:01.240> that<00:05:01.270> sticker<00:05:02.460> make

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:03.460 
right side so take that sticker make

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:05.370 
right side so take that sticker make
that<00:05:03.640> sticker<00:05:03.880> face<00:05:04.150> you<00:05:04.420> and<00:05:04.660> do<00:05:05.020> the<00:05:05.170> right

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:05.380 
that sticker face you and do the right

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:10.920 
that sticker face you and do the right
fish<00:05:05.710> algorithm<00:05:06.520> and<00:05:07.000> do<00:05:07.120> are<00:05:07.890> you<00:05:09.420> all<00:05:10.420> right

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:10.930 
fish algorithm and do are you all right

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:16.200 
fish algorithm and do are you all right
you<00:05:11.920> are<00:05:12.720> you<00:05:13.720> two<00:05:13.960> alright<00:05:14.320> and<00:05:15.100> that<00:05:15.850> should

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:16.210 
you are you two alright and that should

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:20.550 
you are you two alright and that should
solve<00:05:16.480> you<00:05:16.930> yellow<00:05:17.200> stickers<00:05:18.780> now<00:05:19.780> this<00:05:20.320> last

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:20.560 
solve you yellow stickers now this last

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:23.310 
solve you yellow stickers now this last
pattern<00:05:20.890> is<00:05:21.250> to<00:05:21.940> me<00:05:22.090> is<00:05:22.120> very<00:05:22.750> easy<00:05:23.140> to

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:23.320 
pattern is to me is very easy to

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:25.409 
pattern is to me is very easy to
recognize<00:05:23.830> because<00:05:24.070> it<00:05:24.850> looks<00:05:25.060> like<00:05:25.210> the

00:05:25.409 --> 00:05:25.419 
recognize because it looks like the

00:05:25.419 --> 00:05:28.860 
recognize because it looks like the
number<00:05:25.720> 8<00:05:25.990> and<00:05:26.220> the<00:05:27.220> way<00:05:27.400> to<00:05:27.940> hold<00:05:28.180> this<00:05:28.360> to

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:28.870 
number 8 and the way to hold this to

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:34.680 
number 8 and the way to hold this to
solve<00:05:29.169> it<00:05:29.380> is<00:05:30.840> take<00:05:31.840> the<00:05:32.320> top<00:05:32.560> four<00:05:32.950> and<00:05:33.690> make

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:34.690 
solve it is take the top four and make

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:37.230 
solve it is take the top four and make
sure<00:05:34.720> it's<00:05:34.990> on<00:05:35.050> the<00:05:35.200> top<00:05:35.470> left<00:05:35.740> and<00:05:35.950> the<00:05:36.880> bottom

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:37.240 
sure it's on the top left and the bottom

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:40.530 
sure it's on the top left and the bottom
for<00:05:37.450> it<00:05:37.600> it's<00:05:37.930> on<00:05:38.080> the<00:05:38.140> bottom<00:05:38.320> right<00:05:38.650> and<00:05:39.540> hold

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:40.540 
for it it's on the bottom right and hold

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:42.140 
for it it's on the bottom right and hold
it<00:05:40.720> so<00:05:40.960> that<00:05:41.169> there's<00:05:41.500> a<00:05:41.560> yellow<00:05:41.800> sticker

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:42.150 
it so that there's a yellow sticker

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:45.960 
it so that there's a yellow sticker
facing<00:05:43.150> or<00:05:43.330> on<00:05:43.930> the<00:05:44.440> left<00:05:44.650> side<00:05:44.830> so<00:05:45.190> you<00:05:45.430> can't

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:45.970 
facing or on the left side so you can't

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:47.310 
facing or on the left side so you can't
hold<00:05:46.180> it<00:05:46.300> like<00:05:46.450> this<00:05:46.480> because<00:05:46.870> there's<00:05:47.200> no

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:47.320 
hold it like this because there's no

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:49.470 
hold it like this because there's no
sticker<00:05:47.620> right<00:05:47.800> there<00:05:48.090> even<00:05:49.090> though<00:05:49.210> those

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:49.480 
sticker right there even though those

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:53.490 
sticker right there even though those
are<00:05:49.540> facing<00:05:50.380> the<00:05:50.410> right<00:05:50.650> way<00:05:50.760> so<00:05:52.350> stickers<00:05:53.350> on

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:53.500 
are facing the right way so stickers on

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:55.920 
are facing the right way so stickers on
the<00:05:53.620> left<00:05:53.800> side<00:05:53.950> so<00:05:54.880> you<00:05:54.910> do<00:05:55.330> the<00:05:55.480> right<00:05:55.660> fish

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:55.930 
the left side so you do the right fish

00:05:55.930 --> 00:06:01.579 
the left side so you do the right fish
algorithm<00:05:56.620> which<00:05:56.860> is

00:06:01.579 --> 00:06:01.589 

00:06:01.589 --> 00:06:03.749 

and<00:06:02.589> that<00:06:02.770> should<00:06:02.949> give<00:06:03.099> you<00:06:03.249> a<00:06:03.279> fish<00:06:03.490> pattern

00:06:03.749 --> 00:06:03.759 
and that should give you a fish pattern

00:06:03.759 --> 00:06:06.149 
and that should give you a fish pattern
and<00:06:04.120> you<00:06:04.900> just<00:06:05.110> saw<00:06:05.229> that<00:06:05.259> fish<00:06:05.680> pattern<00:06:05.949> you

00:06:06.149 --> 00:06:06.159 
and you just saw that fish pattern you

00:06:06.159 --> 00:06:08.429 
and you just saw that fish pattern you
look<00:06:06.279> for<00:06:06.430> the<00:06:06.460> yellow<00:06:06.699> sticker<00:06:07.029> and<00:06:07.599> on<00:06:08.289> this

00:06:08.429 --> 00:06:08.439 
look for the yellow sticker and on this

00:06:08.439 --> 00:06:10.950 
look for the yellow sticker and on this
case<00:06:08.740> it's<00:06:09.159> on<00:06:09.339> the<00:06:09.520> left<00:06:09.729> side<00:06:09.939> take<00:06:10.930> that

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:10.960 
case it's on the left side take that

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:13.709 
case it's on the left side take that
sticker<00:06:11.469> face<00:06:12.249> it<00:06:12.430> to<00:06:12.550> you<00:06:12.699> and<00:06:12.969> do<00:06:13.360> the<00:06:13.539> right

00:06:13.709 --> 00:06:13.719 
sticker face it to you and do the right

00:06:13.719 --> 00:06:19.170 
sticker face it to you and do the right
fish<00:06:14.050> or<00:06:14.319> left<00:06:14.919> fish<00:06:15.189> algorithm<00:06:15.909> so<00:06:16.979> L<00:06:17.979> I<00:06:18.370> you<00:06:19.120> I
