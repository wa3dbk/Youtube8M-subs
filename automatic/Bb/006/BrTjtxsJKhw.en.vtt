my<00:01:39.259> dad<00:01:39.289> showed<00:01:40.100> me<00:01:40.130> how<00:01:41.000> to<00:01:41.060> launch<00:01:41.509> it<00:01:41.750> you

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:42.080 
my dad showed me how to launch it you

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:43.749 
my dad showed me how to launch it you
flip<00:01:42.289> the<00:01:42.590> top<00:01:42.920> upside<00:01:43.369> down<00:01:43.490> and<00:01:43.550> get<00:01:43.670> the

00:01:43.749 --> 00:01:43.759 
flip the top upside down and get the

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:48.100 
flip the top upside down and get the
nail<00:01:43.910> on<00:01:44.060> top<00:01:44.300> and<00:01:44.569> you<00:01:45.289> go<00:01:45.500> this<00:01:45.950> way<00:01:46.280> and<00:01:47.110> it's

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:48.110 
nail on top and you go this way and it's

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:50.770 
nail on top and you go this way and it's
like<00:01:48.229> hot<00:01:48.709> but<00:01:49.280> does<00:01:49.490> it<00:01:49.640> make<00:01:49.789> sense<00:01:49.850> you

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:50.780 
like hot but does it make sense you

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:53.980 
like hot but does it make sense you
would<00:01:51.190> typically<00:01:52.190> launch<00:01:52.880> it<00:01:53.090> this<00:01:53.119> way<00:01:53.600> which

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:53.990 
would typically launch it this way which

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:59.290 
would typically launch it this way which
kind<00:01:54.380> of<00:01:54.530> makes<00:01:54.679> more<00:01:55.750> hans<00:01:57.369> sense<00:01:58.369> right<00:01:58.970> you

00:01:59.290 --> 00:01:59.300 
kind of makes more hans sense right you

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:04.150 
kind of makes more hans sense right you
just<00:01:59.569> spin<00:01:59.959> it<00:02:00.140> this<00:02:00.500> way<00:02:00.740> but<00:02:02.170> well<00:02:03.170> I<00:02:03.470> haven't

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:04.160 
just spin it this way but well I haven't

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:07.330 
just spin it this way but well I haven't
done<00:02:04.399> it<00:02:04.550> for<00:02:05.709> actually<00:02:06.709> got<00:02:07.009> to<00:02:07.190> the<00:02:07.220> point

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:07.340 
done it for actually got to the point

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:10.839 
done it for actually got to the point
where<00:02:07.700> actually<00:02:08.050> I've<00:02:09.050> done<00:02:09.289> it<00:02:09.520> all<00:02:10.520> that<00:02:10.729> I'm

00:02:10.839 --> 00:02:10.849 
where actually I've done it all that I'm

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:15.370 
where actually I've done it all that I'm
trying<00:02:11.120> to<00:02:11.270> wrap<00:02:11.420> this<00:02:11.599> with<00:02:11.750> one<00:02:11.990> hand

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:15.380 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:17.660 

and<00:02:16.380> one<00:02:16.740> of<00:02:16.770> the<00:02:16.920> problem<00:02:17.250> with<00:02:17.370> this<00:02:17.490> one

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
and one of the problem with this one

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:19.460 
and one of the problem with this one
there's<00:02:17.910> a<00:02:18.000> recoil<00:02:18.420> there's<00:02:18.840> a<00:02:18.900> possible

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
there's a recoil there's a possible

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:22.340 
there's a recoil there's a possible
recoil<00:02:20.010> and<00:02:20.250> you<00:02:20.580> just<00:02:20.820> watch<00:02:20.970> your<00:02:21.240> head<00:02:21.420> like

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:22.350 
recoil and you just watch your head like

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:25.010 
recoil and you just watch your head like
I<00:02:22.440> hit<00:02:22.590> my<00:02:22.710> head<00:02:22.830> my<00:02:23.310> forehead<00:02:23.640> one<00:02:23.820> time<00:02:24.030> so

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:25.020 
I hit my head my forehead one time so

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:31.000 
I hit my head my forehead one time so
let's<00:02:25.800> see<00:02:25.980> if<00:02:26.070> this<00:02:26.220> works<00:02:28.700> there<00:02:29.700> we<00:02:29.880> go

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.010 
let's see if this works there we go

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:35.810 
let's see if this works there we go
amazing<00:02:33.230> and<00:02:34.230> same<00:02:34.530> thing<00:02:34.800> you<00:02:35.370> can<00:02:35.520> have<00:02:35.670> the

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:35.820 
amazing and same thing you can have the

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:41.330 
amazing and same thing you can have the
spin<00:02:36.060> on<00:02:36.210> your<00:02:36.330> hand<00:02:37.670> yeah<00:02:38.670> so<00:02:38.940> got<00:02:39.150> it
