00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:11.130
 This time I'm going to start a video again 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:13.139
 little nervous because I did not to 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.660
 accessing more of the 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:18.090

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.430
 ask filipe where is part 78 because 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.830
 You do not have to leave the headquarters anymore. 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:25.350
 guide yes if it is because from the beginning 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:28.800
 this week in the region is a sack of a 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:31.289
 The whole bank I play a little bit and the 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.309
 bull cities have to revert it to 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.899
 other states 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:35.670
 and today there is a city that I 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:38.489
 I can not enter the city of 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.760
 electronics that is making the video is 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:43.140
 enter simply can not enter 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:45.420
 full of bugs then this kind of thing 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.980
 So, because I do not want to do the 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.200
 other videos because I'm rolling 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:52.140
 something if it is not because the game 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.730
 It really is not letting me play. 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.370
 I have other cities that are not 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.050
 connected but in my region is whole 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:01.410
 if I can not do practically 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.250
 nothing happened a blog as soon as 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.159
 to fix 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.750
 I come back with the videos of the series but this one 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.830
 video also want to talk about other 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:12.060
 things 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:15.000
 today pet 1.7 entered in the game that 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:17.340
 whose greatest promise is the improvements in 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.860
 traffic system I have been following 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:23.369
 and that the development of this pet 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:25.170
 pet in the sim siri and tatinha's blog 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:27.900
 shown things like that did not have the 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:30.540
 cars and had a crowded lower road 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:33.900
 So the guy and make an avenue owns 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:36.000
 come back and decide the cars with the time he 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:38.280
 with that they started to take the avenue 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.409
 and the congestion started 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:43.290
 take it as if they learned that 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:45.060
 what the avenue is a better way of 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:49.229
 that that way of a congested 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:51.600
 only with the smallest best stroke then 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:55.020
 these pet came in today I made some 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:57.390
 I did not notice anything different. 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.909
 I practically did not notice I saw some 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.890
 people there in the head also of the simple go 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:03.719
 doing tests said they did not change 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.820
 Nothing, then I do not know if I really 

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:07.649
 come into practice or if we have to 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.399
 will activate some condition for this 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:10.770
 to function 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:13.920
 other things that these pet does is also 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:17.040
 dae is more priority than GM vehicles 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:18.380
 delivery vehicles agency I also 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.989
 am I can not mention because 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:23.670
 would need to see enough and 

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:26.459
 also the pet promises to improve 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:29.190
 performance on computers there that have 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:31.920
 Honest is lower and cheaper 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:33.810
 Also this one has no way to test me but 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:35.970
 I hope it's working 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:38.880
 Another thing I want to talk about today is 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:40.530
 about that free game I think 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:45.090
 If you're playing yes if you 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:46.890
 received this medium of maxieira is 19 wins 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:49.050
 a game of grace how does this 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:51.120
 story how does week work 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:53.819
 and said that it is to give this game of 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:56.040
 grace to compensate for the problems of 

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:57.840
 The simple island launch knows that 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.590
 week that no one could even enter 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:01.200
 in the game 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:02.730
 knows the bugs that until now permeate all 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:05.130
 place and that's why I can not do 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:07.739
 more videos because she is giving a 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:10.110
 free game to see if it softens this 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:12.030
 this situation with its consumers 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:14.010
 how will it work you have already received 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:19.109
