00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.180 
simple toy kids love it this is one of
those<00:00:45.989> second<00:00:46.410> versions<00:00:46.710> that<00:00:46.829> came<00:00:47.070> in

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
those second versions that came in

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:48.979 
those second versions that came in
actually<00:00:47.340> because<00:00:47.670> if<00:00:47.820> you<00:00:47.910> remember<00:00:48.090> someone

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
actually because if you remember someone

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:50.420 
actually because if you remember someone
that<00:00:49.110> really<00:00:49.320> all<00:00:49.500> ones<00:00:49.710> had<00:00:49.920> a<00:00:49.950> string<00:00:50.309> that

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
that really all ones had a string that

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.549 
that really all ones had a string that
you<00:00:50.579> pull<00:00:50.879> and<00:00:51.210> that<00:00:51.719> would<00:00:51.809> go<00:00:51.930> back<00:00:52.110> in<00:00:52.350> and

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
you pull and that would go back in and

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.410 
you pull and that would go back in and
this<00:00:53.039> thing<00:00:53.250> would<00:00:53.399> you<00:00:53.460> know<00:00:53.640> spin<00:00:54.300> around

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
this thing would you know spin around

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.569 
this thing would you know spin around
