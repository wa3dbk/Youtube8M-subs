00:05:02.629 --> 00:05:02.639 
and that nightmare isn't falling as fast

00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:04.550 
and that nightmare isn't falling as fast
as<00:05:02.820> one<00:05:02.940> would<00:05:03.060> expect<00:05:03.120> is<00:05:03.810> that<00:05:03.870> about<00:05:04.139> 50%

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:04.560

turned its guns on the macari all now it

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:14.300 
turned its guns on the macari all now it
looks<00:05:13.229> as<00:05:13.410> if<00:05:13.500> the<00:05:13.560> nightmares<00:05:13.949> gonna<00:05:14.130> lose
