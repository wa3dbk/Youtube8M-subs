case shut so this is gonna add a lot of

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:40.010 
case shut so this is gonna add a lot of
protection<00:01:35.040> to<00:01:35.600> your<00:01:36.600> phone<00:01:36.659> and<00:01:38.720> you<00:01:39.720> see

protection to your phone and you see

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.520 
protection to your phone and you see
there's<00:01:40.229> a<00:01:40.460> honeycomb<00:01:41.460> look<00:01:41.790> on<00:01:42.630> the<00:01:43.259> inside

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
of the plastic case and I guess that

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.060 
of the plastic case and I guess that
adds<00:01:48.479> a<00:01:48.630> little<00:01:48.720> bit<00:01:48.840> more<00:01:49.049> flexibility<00:01:49.860> to

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
adds a little bit more flexibility to

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.560 
adds a little bit more flexibility to
the<00:01:50.159> case<00:01:52.790> there<00:01:53.790> you<00:01:53.909> can<00:01:54.030> see<00:01:54.210> there's<00:01:54.420> the

button on the side there and then you

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.700 
button on the side there and then you
can<00:01:58.259> see<00:01:58.439> there<00:01:59.009> is<00:01:59.250> the<00:01:59.780> volume<00:02:00.780> and<00:02:00.990> the
