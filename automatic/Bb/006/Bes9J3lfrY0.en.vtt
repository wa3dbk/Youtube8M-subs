so<00:00:19.619> pregnancy<00:00:20.010> brain<00:00:20.160> is<00:00:20.310> one<00:00:20.460> of<00:00:20.550> those

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
so pregnancy brain is one of those

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:22.250 
so pregnancy brain is one of those
things<00:00:20.820> that<00:00:20.970> people<00:00:21.270> discuss<00:00:21.630> anecdotally

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
things that people discuss anecdotally

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.109 
things that people discuss anecdotally
so<00:00:22.410> often<00:00:22.859> that<00:00:22.890> we<00:00:23.039> just<00:00:23.130> accept<00:00:23.699> that<00:00:23.820> it's<00:00:24.000> a

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
so often that we just accept that it's a

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:27.170 
so often that we just accept that it's a
medical<00:00:24.779> side<00:00:25.260> effect<00:00:25.680> of<00:00:25.830> pregnancy<00:00:26.180> but

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
medical side effect of pregnancy but

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.240 
medical side effect of pregnancy but
gives<00:00:27.570> it<00:00:27.750> to<00:00:28.170> find<00:00:28.410> out<00:00:28.560> we<00:00:28.710> interviewed<00:00:29.099> dr.

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
gives it to find out we interviewed dr.

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:30.800

yeah<00:00:33.300> with<00:00:33.510> with<00:00:33.840> better<00:00:34.340> neuroimaging

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
yeah with with better neuroimaging

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.819 
yeah with with better neuroimaging
techniques<00:00:35.640> we're<00:00:36.420> able<00:00:36.570> now<00:00:36.840> to<00:00:36.870> see<00:00:37.559> in<00:00:37.649> real

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
techniques we're able now to see in real

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.340 
techniques we're able now to see in real
time<00:00:38.300> what<00:00:39.300> the<00:00:39.420> effects<00:00:39.780> are<00:00:39.989> of<00:00:40.200> different

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
time what the effects are of different

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.200 
time what the effects are of different
phases<00:00:40.710> of<00:00:40.920> life<00:00:41.160> and<00:00:41.460> what<00:00:41.550> they<00:00:41.670> found<00:00:41.879> in<00:00:42.120> a

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
phases of life and what they found in a

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.720 
phases of life and what they found in a
study<00:00:42.450> in<00:00:42.600> Canada<00:00:42.989> was<00:00:43.110> it<00:00:43.640> there's<00:00:44.640> a

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
study in Canada was it there's a

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.060 
study in Canada was it there's a
diminishment<00:00:45.300> and<00:00:45.660> the<00:00:45.809> volume<00:00:46.289> of<00:00:46.710> the<00:00:46.800> brain

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
diminishment and the volume of the brain

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.490 
diminishment and the volume of the brain
of<00:00:47.399> about<00:00:47.879> four<00:00:48.149> percent<00:00:48.300> in<00:00:48.809> particular<00:00:49.379> is<00:00:49.469> a

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
of about four percent in particular is a

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.740 
of about four percent in particular is a
diminishment<00:00:50.370> the<00:00:50.610> volume<00:00:50.940> of<00:00:51.059> hippocampus

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
diminishment the volume of hippocampus

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.209 
diminishment the volume of hippocampus
which<00:00:51.899> is<00:00:52.050> an<00:00:52.140> area<00:00:52.350> that's<00:00:52.469> responsible<00:00:52.590> for

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
which is an area that's responsible for

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.490 
which is an area that's responsible for
new<00:00:54.030> memories<00:00:54.480> and<00:00:54.840> for<00:00:55.050> spatial

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
new memories and for spatial

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.950 
new memories and for spatial
relationships<00:00:56.250> it<00:00:56.760> would<00:00:56.879> seem<00:00:57.090> logical<00:00:57.449> but

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
relationships it would seem logical but

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.779 
relationships it would seem logical but
if<00:00:58.079> that's<00:00:58.230> shrinking<00:00:58.500> then<00:00:59.219> it's<00:00:59.460> not<00:00:59.609> as

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
if that's shrinking then it's not as

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.400 
if that's shrinking then it's not as
effective<00:01:00.270> and<00:01:00.539> that<00:01:00.690> would<00:01:00.809> account<00:01:01.079> then

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
effective and that would account then

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.759 
effective and that would account then

know<00:03:00.519> Bill<00:03:00.760> Cosby's<00:03:01.180> say<00:03:01.450> the<00:03:01.570> kids<00:03:01.840> all<00:03:02.110> have

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:02.290 
know Bill Cosby's say the kids all have

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:03.600 
know Bill Cosby's say the kids all have
brain<00:03:02.560> damage<00:03:02.590> but<00:03:03.040> i<00:03:03.070> think<00:03:03.220> he<00:03:03.280> got<00:03:03.310> exactly

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:03.610 
brain damage but i think he got exactly

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:06.390 
brain damage but i think he got exactly
wrong<00:03:04.060> kids<00:03:04.810> cause<00:03:05.140> brain<00:03:05.500> damage<00:03:05.680> I<00:03:06.130> think

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:06.400 
wrong kids cause brain damage I think

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:07.860 
wrong kids cause brain damage I think
it's<00:03:06.519> quantifiable<00:03:07.209> I<00:03:07.269> think<00:03:07.450> you<00:03:07.510> can<00:03:07.630> find

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:07.870 
it's quantifiable I think you can find

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:10.259 
it's quantifiable I think you can find

00:03:24.479 --> 00:03:24.489 
lobotomy is that why i drew a lot

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:26.729 
lobotomy is that why i drew a lot
probably<00:03:25.030> so<00:03:25.180> yeah<00:03:25.480> you<00:03:25.930> know<00:03:26.019> what<00:03:26.140> this<00:03:26.590> is
