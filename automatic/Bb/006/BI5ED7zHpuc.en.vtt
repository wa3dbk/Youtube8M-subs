00:00:49.229 --> 00:00:49.239 
a light hold and that's mainly why i

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:52.560 
a light hold and that's mainly why i
needed<00:00:49.539> to<00:00:49.809> operate<00:00:50.160> ok<00:00:51.160> so<00:00:51.910> first<00:00:52.210> of<00:00:52.359> all<00:00:52.390> you

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:52.570 
needed to operate ok so first of all you

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:56.340 
needed to operate ok so first of all you
smell<00:00:52.870> it<00:00:53.050> smells<00:00:53.379> delicious<00:00:54.129> if<00:00:54.730> the<00:00:55.350> avocado

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:56.350 
smell it smells delicious if the avocado

whipped<00:00:56.769> cream<00:00:56.980> smell<00:00:57.340> like<00:00:57.579> this<00:00:57.789> like<00:00:58.059> i

00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:58.210 
whipped cream smell like this like i

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:00.029 
whipped cream smell like this like i
would<00:00:58.359> definitely<00:00:58.719> be<00:00:59.019> all<00:00:59.289> over<00:00:59.649> it<00:00:59.739> all<00:00:59.920> the

00:01:00.029 --> 00:01:00.039 
would definitely be all over it all the

00:01:00.039 --> 00:01:02.250 
would definitely be all over it all the
time<00:01:00.100> so<00:01:00.940> it's<00:01:01.300> very<00:01:01.600> it's<00:01:01.840> a<00:01:01.899> little<00:01:02.140> bit

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:02.260 
time so it's very it's a little bit

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:08.160 
time so it's very it's a little bit
thicker<00:01:03.239> to<00:01:04.239> see<00:01:04.480> it<00:01:04.600> um<00:01:06.060> it<00:01:07.060> doesn't<00:01:07.270> move<00:01:07.600> and

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:08.170 
thicker to see it um it doesn't move and

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:11.130 
thicker to see it um it doesn't move and
so<00:01:08.530> it's<00:01:08.770> like<00:01:08.979> it's<00:01:09.640> less<00:01:09.909> creamy<00:01:10.360> than<00:01:10.960> the

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:11.140 
so it's like it's less creamy than the

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:16.200 
so it's like it's less creamy than the
although<00:01:11.500> cream<00:01:11.850> um<00:01:12.850> but<00:01:13.810> I<00:01:14.700> mean<00:01:15.700> the<00:01:16.180> reason

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:16.210 
although cream um but I mean the reason

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:18.870 
although cream um but I mean the reason
why<00:01:17.200> I'm<00:01:17.560> always<00:01:18.070> like<00:01:18.310> on<00:01:18.460> the<00:01:18.549> fence<00:01:18.759> with

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:18.880 
why I'm always like on the fence with

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:20.190 
why I'm always like on the fence with
this<00:01:19.030> bright<00:01:19.210> like<00:01:19.360> I<00:01:19.450> like<00:01:19.659> it<00:01:19.810> but<00:01:19.960> then<00:01:20.110> I

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:20.200 
this bright like I like it but then I

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:21.510 
this bright like I like it but then I
don't<00:01:20.409> really<00:01:20.560> like<00:01:20.770> it<00:01:20.890> because<00:01:21.009> I<00:01:21.189> really

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:21.520 
don't really like it because I really

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:24.840 
don't really like it because I really
think<00:01:21.700> the<00:01:22.240> beeswax<00:01:22.840> me<00:01:23.680> makes<00:01:24.130> it<00:01:24.400> harder<00:01:24.820> for

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:24.850 
think the beeswax me makes it harder for

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:26.910 
think the beeswax me makes it harder for
it<00:01:25.270> to<00:01:25.570> run<00:01:25.990> my<00:01:26.170> fingers<00:01:26.590> through<00:01:26.799> my<00:01:26.829> hair

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:26.920 
it to run my fingers through my hair

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:29.130 
it to run my fingers through my hair
like<00:01:27.189> it's<00:01:27.369> harder<00:01:27.729> to<00:01:27.759> distribute<00:01:28.509> and<00:01:28.689> I

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:29.140 
like it's harder to distribute and I

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:31.590 
like it's harder to distribute and I
don't<00:01:29.470> really<00:01:29.860> like<00:01:30.310> that<00:01:30.850> when<00:01:31.030> I<00:01:31.060> had<00:01:31.570> that

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:31.600 
don't really like that when I had that

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.510 
don't really like that when I had that
same<00:01:32.020> problem<00:01:32.049> with<00:01:32.770> you<00:01:33.070> know<00:01:33.159> the<00:01:33.340> whip

quickly<00:01:40.780> um<00:01:41.140> and<00:01:41.560> also<00:01:41.979> because<00:01:42.909> of<00:01:43.090> that<00:01:43.240> you

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:43.450 
quickly um and also because of that you

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:48.600 
quickly um and also because of that you
know<00:01:43.479> how<00:01:43.860> aloe<00:01:44.860> vera<00:01:45.549> gel<00:01:45.820> is<00:01:46.119> not<00:01:47.159> very<00:01:48.159> it

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:48.610 
know how aloe vera gel is not very it

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:51.240 
know how aloe vera gel is not very it
does<00:01:49.240> like<00:01:49.540> it'll<00:01:49.840> give<00:01:50.439> you<00:01:50.500> some<00:01:50.680> hole<00:01:50.890> but

does like it'll give you some hole but

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:53.310 
does like it'll give you some hole but

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:53.320 
it doesn't have a lot of pumping with it

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:55.020 
it doesn't have a lot of pumping with it
because<00:01:53.469> it's<00:01:53.770> basically<00:01:54.100> it's<00:01:54.430> almost<00:01:54.729> just

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:55.030 
because it's basically it's almost just

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:56.940

gives<00:02:15.230> me<00:02:15.410> a<00:02:15.650> really<00:02:16.460> good<00:02:16.580> definition<00:02:17.510> but

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:18.080 
gives me a really good definition but

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:19.600 
gives me a really good definition but
then<00:02:18.260> there's<00:02:18.470> not<00:02:18.650> a<00:02:18.680> lot<00:02:18.860> of<00:02:18.890> comfy<00:02:19.310> and<00:02:19.460> then

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:19.610 
then there's not a lot of comfy and then

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:21.640 
then there's not a lot of comfy and then
there's<00:02:19.790> a<00:02:19.850> little<00:02:20.240> stray<00:02:20.540> hairs<00:02:20.900> in<00:02:21.170> the

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:54.260 
because I know last time I travel to

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.800 
because I know last time I travel to
Florida<00:02:54.830> I<00:02:55.100> didn't<00:02:55.700> I<00:02:56.030> think<00:02:56.420> I<00:02:56.510> might<00:02:56.780> have

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:56.810 
Florida I didn't I think I might have

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:58.330 
Florida I didn't I think I might have
has<00:02:57.110> a<00:02:57.140> formulation<00:02:57.650> wrong<00:02:57.920> I<00:02:58.040> didn't<00:02:58.250> really

00:02:58.330 --> 00:02:58.340 
has a formulation wrong I didn't really

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:59.920 
has a formulation wrong I didn't really
look<00:02:58.610> at<00:02:58.760> the<00:02:58.880> dew<00:02:59.090> points<00:02:59.480> and<00:02:59.570> I<00:02:59.600> think<00:02:59.840> they

00:02:59.920 --> 00:02:59.930 
look at the dew points and I think they

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:02.470 
look at the dew points and I think they
might<00:03:00.110> have<00:03:00.140> been<00:03:00.380> too<00:03:01.010> high<00:03:01.340> for<00:03:01.910> me<00:03:01.940> to<00:03:02.120> be

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:02.480 
might have been too high for me to be

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:05.830 
might have been too high for me to be
using<00:03:03.820> multiple<00:03:04.820> products<00:03:05.240> with<00:03:05.360> glycerin<00:03:05.720> on

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:05.840 
using multiple products with glycerin on

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:07.510 
using multiple products with glycerin on
my<00:03:05.930> hair<00:03:06.170> I<00:03:06.200> think<00:03:06.560> I<00:03:06.710> should<00:03:07.010> have<00:03:07.130> just<00:03:07.190> kept

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:07.520 
my hair I think I should have just kept

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:09.430 
my hair I think I should have just kept
it<00:03:07.640> at<00:03:07.760> one<00:03:07.970> in<00:03:08.210> my<00:03:08.390> hair<00:03:08.570> was<00:03:08.750> a<00:03:08.780> mess<00:03:08.900> like<00:03:09.320> I

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:09.440 
it at one in my hair was a mess like I

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:11.440 
it at one in my hair was a mess like I
had<00:03:09.560> to<00:03:09.680> like<00:03:09.830> deep<00:03:10.040> condition<00:03:10.550> when<00:03:11.180> I<00:03:11.210> got

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:11.450 
had to like deep condition when I got

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:12.910 
had to like deep condition when I got
there<00:03:11.660> and<00:03:11.810> it<00:03:11.870> was<00:03:11.930> discoursing<00:03:12.380> it's<00:03:12.680> even

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:12.920 
there and it was discoursing it's even

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:15.340 
there and it was discoursing it's even
more<00:03:13.130> humid<00:03:13.610> here<00:03:14.060> than<00:03:14.540> it<00:03:14.630> was<00:03:14.780> in<00:03:14.810> Florida

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:15.350 
more humid here than it was in Florida

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:18.280 
more humid here than it was in Florida
so<00:03:16.040> I<00:03:16.490> mean<00:03:17.000> it<00:03:17.180> did<00:03:17.360> a<00:03:17.390> really<00:03:17.570> good<00:03:17.750> job<00:03:17.810> this

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:18.290 
so I mean it did a really good job this

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:20.980 
so I mean it did a really good job this
stuff<00:03:18.760> the<00:03:19.760> only<00:03:20.090> seriously<00:03:20.840> the<00:03:20.960> only

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:20.990 
stuff the only seriously the only

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:23.530 
stuff the only seriously the only
problem<00:03:21.800> I<00:03:21.920> have<00:03:22.160> with<00:03:22.190> it<00:03:22.460> i<00:03:22.610> think<00:03:23.180> i<00:03:23.420> think

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:23.540 
problem I have with it i think i think

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:27.070 
problem I have with it i think i think
it's<00:03:24.020> the<00:03:24.110> beeswax<00:03:24.770> I<00:03:25.070> really<00:03:26.000> do<00:03:26.210> I<00:03:26.540> mean<00:03:26.870> it's

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:27.080 
it's the beeswax I really do I mean it's

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:29.140 
it's the beeswax I really do I mean it's
a<00:03:27.170> really<00:03:27.470> good<00:03:27.770> moisturizer<00:03:28.580> is<00:03:28.940> where<00:03:29.120> I

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:29.150 
a really good moisturizer is where I

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:30.790 
a really good moisturizer is where I
think<00:03:29.480> it<00:03:29.600> would<00:03:29.690> be<00:03:29.810> great<00:03:30.050> for<00:03:30.410> twist

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:30.800 
think it would be great for twist

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:32.710 
think it would be great for twist
because<00:03:31.430> if<00:03:31.760> you're<00:03:31.910> doing<00:03:32.180> twins<00:03:32.450> like<00:03:32.600> you

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:32.720 
because if you're doing twins like you

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:33.940 
because if you're doing twins like you
won't<00:03:32.870> have<00:03:32.960> to<00:03:33.050> worry<00:03:33.260> about<00:03:33.350> you<00:03:33.800> know<00:03:33.830> the

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:33.950 
won't have to worry about you know the

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:36.040 
won't have to worry about you know the
little<00:03:34.280> hairs<00:03:35.000> in<00:03:35.210> between<00:03:35.480> because<00:03:35.630> you're

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:36.050 
little hairs in between because you're

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:39.210 
little hairs in between because you're
you<00:03:36.410> know<00:03:36.530> styling<00:03:37.250> your<00:03:37.370> hair<00:03:37.540> that<00:03:38.540> are<00:03:38.720> um

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:39.220 
you know styling your hair that are um

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:41.680 
you know styling your hair that are um
and<00:03:40.220> also<00:03:40.640> you<00:03:40.700> don't<00:03:40.910> have<00:03:41.060> to<00:03:41.330> worry<00:03:41.510> about

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:41.690 
and also you don't have to worry about

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:44.140 
and also you don't have to worry about
you<00:03:42.140> know<00:03:42.170> having<00:03:43.100> to<00:03:43.310> run<00:03:43.580> your<00:03:43.760> fingers

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:44.150 
you know having to run your fingers

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:45.370 
you know having to run your fingers
through<00:03:44.180> your<00:03:44.330> hair<00:03:44.420> to<00:03:44.690> distribute<00:03:45.170> because

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:45.380 
through your hair to distribute because

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:48.670 
through your hair to distribute because
you're<00:03:45.640> twisting<00:03:46.640> it<00:03:46.810> so<00:03:47.810> I<00:03:47.840> mean<00:03:48.350> it's<00:03:48.590> a

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:48.680 
you're twisting it so I mean it's a

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:51.820 
you're twisting it so I mean it's a
holding<00:03:49.040> butter<00:03:49.250> it<00:03:49.610> says<00:03:50.090> the<00:03:50.590> beeswax<00:03:51.590> is

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:51.830 
holding butter it says the beeswax is

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:54.850 
holding butter it says the beeswax is
for<00:03:52.070> a<00:03:52.100> like<00:03:52.490> hold<00:03:52.880> but<00:03:53.300> I<00:03:53.620> could<00:03:54.620> do<00:03:54.740> without

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:54.860 
for a like hold but I could do without

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:57.040 
for a like hold but I could do without
it<00:03:55.100> if<00:03:55.430> she<00:03:55.640> just<00:03:55.760> took<00:03:55.970> the<00:03:56.150> beeswax<00:03:56.630> out<00:03:56.810> this

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:57.050 
it if she just took the beeswax out this

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:58.690 
it if she just took the beeswax out this
would<00:03:57.170> probably<00:03:57.350> be<00:03:57.590> a<00:03:57.710> lighter<00:03:58.010> product<00:03:58.550> but

00:03:58.690 --> 00:03:58.700 
would probably be a lighter product but

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:02.320 
would probably be a lighter product but
i<00:03:58.760> think<00:03:59.030> i<00:03:59.120> would<00:03:59.180> like<00:03:59.450> it<00:03:59.510> better<00:03:59.810> um<00:04:01.330> but

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:02.330 
i think i would like it better um but
