original game that's what it was about

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.300 
original game that's what it was about
even<00:01:10.020> though<00:01:10.110> it<00:01:10.170> was<00:01:10.260> a<00:01:10.290> 2d<00:01:10.770> platformer<00:01:11.250> but

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
of course back then 1989 i think it was

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.340 
of course back then 1989 i think it was
first<00:01:14.340> released<00:01:14.900> parkour<00:01:15.900> didn't<00:01:16.080> exist
