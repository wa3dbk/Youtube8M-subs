00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:05.060
 the roots of the mid-series go back to the year 1987 as the Schlei 

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:07.850
 Shooter for SMS 6 2 was released 

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:13.020
 later followed porting for other systems including the c64 and SNES 

00:00:13.649 --> 00:00:17.759
 In 1998, the series made the leap into the third dimension with Metal Gear Solid 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.509
 just recently added a voice over 

00:00:21.509 --> 00:00:25.039
 Ten years later, this mobile version was released for the ND -eschbach 

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:28.039
 been 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.199
 the plot of the game is critical 

00:00:32.199 --> 00:00:34.540
 lonely special agent is saving the world 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:37.620
 Of course, an obscure woman plays the role as well 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.520
 like a new technical achievement 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:43.180
 Here is the improved version of the Metal Gear MESZ with Dom rockets 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:44.760
 Threatening world peace 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.530
 Throughout the mission you can contact God in May 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:51.139
 and in this way has important information 

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:54.139
 which you would have had before the mission 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:59.100
 Also the gameplay holds itself a well-known conventions since the opponents in 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.920
 the majority you are at the beginning only one application deadline or has it applies 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:05.680
 to sneak it as undetected as possible to the target 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:08.970
 Fortunately, the rooms had plenty of opportunities to hide 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.550
 Kistner are everywhere around as if you were in the central warehouse of 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:13.320
 Amazon 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.650
 and left a secret military installations 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.520
 as the watchful obedience the soldiers are always on the same track 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:21.609
 Patrol go 

00:01:21.609 --> 00:01:24.940
 can be found out with a little patience and observation 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:27.900
 when you can walk where long without being discovered 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.520
 If necessary, the guards also worked out seminars from their position way 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:32.049
 Curls 

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:35.049
 if they block a single passage 

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:39.680
 A nice feature of the game is that you get the color of its camouflage suit 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:41.520
 Sammy environment can adapt 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.650
 you just stand in front of a wall 

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:48.280
 Switched during the observation period and then photographed the wall 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:50.310
 camouflage changed its color 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.810
 and then, when you hit a wall, you press it against your opponents 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:55.579
 invisible but unfortunately just 

00:01:55.579 --> 00:01:58.579
 then if you look at the bank 

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:03.300
 Observing Smola It's always a nice thing to get a better one 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:05.230
 To make picture of a room 

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:07.929
 in the plan view in the normally played 

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:11.670
 you see only too small image sections the radar I find 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:15.099
 something additional and to be able to do something with it 

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:18.730
 As a cool feature, you can change the camera of his mobile phone 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:20.049
 Use perspective 

00:02:20.049 --> 00:02:23.810
 However, I wonder if the game is not secretly taking pictures of mine 

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:25.759
 Environment makes and Ankum sends names 

00:02:25.759 --> 00:02:28.759
 because they want to know where I like to play 

00:02:38.009 --> 00:02:40.129
 I actually like Schleich Shooter 

00:02:40.129 --> 00:02:44.409
 but Gerd and Sam Fisher got me on PC with the EU or at least one 

00:02:44.409 --> 00:02:48.559
 Persecutor's perspective spoiled from the I can watch the opponents better 

00:02:48.559 --> 00:02:52.349
 the switching between plan view and observation post therefore increases 

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:53.299
 takes time 

00:02:53.299 --> 00:02:56.769
 and I have in the rush first has unwanted observation mode 

00:02:56.769 --> 00:03:00.839
 turned on instead of bringing me to cover what then always the alarm 

00:03:00.839 --> 00:03:03.189
 has triggered 

00:03:03.189 --> 00:03:06.839
 and so I memorized the levels but in my opinion 

00:03:06.839 --> 00:03:08.699
 not so creeping missed 

00:03:08.699 --> 00:03:12.089
 You also have to get used to the markets in Estoril and the abstruse ones 

00:03:12.089 --> 00:03:13.009
 characters 

00:03:13.009 --> 00:03:16.009
 but that's just part of Metal Gear Solid 4 Yuichi 

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:19.439
 the VR started 

00:03:19.439 --> 00:03:22.199
 yes, but unfortunately not 

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:25.779
 the replay value is high that various awards are the one 

00:03:25.779 --> 00:03:28.129
 can not reach everyone during a game 

00:03:28.129 --> 00:03:31.730
 I would like to emphasize here only the award you get for it 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:34.730
 play through the game in less than 5 40 minutes 

00:03:37.159 --> 00:03:40.260
 All in all, the English version of Metal Gear Solid is not 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:41.279
 bad game 

00:03:41.279 --> 00:03:44.989
 Dances series can safely access and fans of Schleich shooters 

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:46.669
 for lack of competition as well 

00:03:46.669 --> 00:03:50.180
 the use of the handy camera fell over and should look in the sea 

00:03:50.179 --> 00:03:51.609
 to introduce play 

00:03:51.609 --> 00:03:55.430
 Who does not want to spend ten euros for the title but should at least times 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:56.739
 have tried the demo
