00:00:00.649 --> 00:00:03.470
 for a first try this fisherman 12 euros 

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:06.720
 the occasion of a day dedicated to the fishermen of frogs 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:09.709
 because right now it's still too narrow 

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:12.379
 youtube shows a technique 

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:15.019
 yahoo 

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:17.789
 this course is for adults only 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:19.820
 expensive tourcoing jump 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:22.820
 your questions to your jerseys and that the relationship film 

00:00:23.329 --> 00:00:26.329
 for me it must be 

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:30.710
 so here are the frogs 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:33.710
 I do not know if you see them very well 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:36.710
 it's very, very early 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.790
 we do not see anything at all 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.350
 100 seats nothing more 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.910
 still had a touch 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:53.910
 color but to give the hymns 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.870
 tickle them rotate the milk 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:58.950
 the balance of the cud hart 

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:00.820
 and that's how the country 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:04.280
 still dead 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:07.480
 all gently 

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:10.480
 my subject is not technical 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:21.340
 and again the fisherman 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:24.340
 it would be too big too plump 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:27.340
 they learn that world champion as we can do 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.470
 it's a sum only if your entry 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:45.200
 also we can small mouse then shoe 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:48.680
 the mini picnic a bit like us 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:51.680
 it's paul jorion 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:55.770
 ben ameur 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.770
 marc lopez 

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:04.540
 more sober that I hold the camera with my right hand 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:07.200
 I am right-handed can not keep up 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.200
 for a southpaw 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:14.709
 and then we have at least put forward 

00:02:15.549 --> 00:02:17.759
 our emotion 

00:02:17.759 --> 00:02:20.759
 in the same department as this 

00:02:22.389 --> 00:02:25.769
 there are plenty of rennais frogs yet open 

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:29.039
 and the rout 

00:02:29.039 --> 00:02:31.059
 tokyo to create all
