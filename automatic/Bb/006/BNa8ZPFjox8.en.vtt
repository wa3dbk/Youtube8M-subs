00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.020 
bit off more than I could chew this
morning<00:00:06.509> I<00:00:06.600> think<00:00:06.839> I've<00:00:07.049> got<00:00:07.200> a<00:00:07.230> 2001<00:00:08.099> Chevy

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:09.030 
morning I think I've got a 2001 Chevy

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.440 
morning I think I've got a 2001 Chevy
Tahoe<00:00:09.300> with<00:00:09.780> a<00:00:09.870> 5.3<00:00:10.590> v8<00:00:11.160> with<00:00:11.670> the<00:00:11.880> heavy<00:00:12.210> duty

Tahoe with a 5.3 v8 with the heavy duty

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.499 
Tahoe with a 5.3 v8 with the heavy duty
towing<00:00:12.630> package<00:00:12.900> and<00:00:13.790> I<00:00:14.790> thought<00:00:15.269> it<00:00:15.389> was<00:00:15.450> a

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
towing package and I thought it was a

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:17.660 
towing package and I thought it was a
heavy<00:00:15.719> duty<00:00:15.990> transmission<00:00:16.279> but<00:00:17.279> I've<00:00:17.460> learned

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
heavy duty transmission but I've learned

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.050 
heavy duty transmission but I've learned
it's<00:00:17.910> a<00:00:18.000> 4l60e<00:00:18.980> which<00:00:19.980> is<00:00:20.189> not<00:00:20.400> the<00:00:20.609> heavy<00:00:20.789> one

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
it's a 4l60e which is not the heavy one

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.029 
it's a 4l60e which is not the heavy one
that<00:00:21.300> would<00:00:21.420> be<00:00:21.539> in<00:00:21.660> mated<00:00:22.529> with<00:00:22.560> the<00:00:22.800> six

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
that would be in mated with the six

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:24.470 
that would be in mated with the six
liter<00:00:23.279> Chev<00:00:23.580> engine<00:00:23.939> which<00:00:24.090> would<00:00:24.269> be<00:00:24.359> the

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
liter Chev engine which would be the

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.670 
liter Chev engine which would be the
four<00:00:24.920> late-2008<00:00:25.920> this<00:00:26.519> is<00:00:26.670> the<00:00:26.789> 4l60<00:00:27.500> and<00:00:28.500> the

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
four late-2008 this is the 4l60 and the

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.230 
four late-2008 this is the 4l60 and the
first<00:00:28.890> problem<00:00:29.279> I<00:00:29.369> encountered<00:00:29.910> was<00:00:30.029> when<00:00:30.210> I

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
first problem I encountered was when I

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.260 
first problem I encountered was when I
went<00:00:30.390> to<00:00:30.539> buy<00:00:30.660> the<00:00:30.740> automatic<00:00:31.740> transmission

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:32.270 
went to buy the automatic transmission

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:35.060 
went to buy the automatic transmission
filter<00:00:33.270> and<00:00:33.510> I<00:00:33.809> was<00:00:33.930> asked<00:00:34.290> is<00:00:34.350> it<00:00:34.500> a<00:00:34.530> deep<00:00:34.770> pan

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
filter and I was asked is it a deep pan

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:36.830 
filter and I was asked is it a deep pan
or<00:00:35.280> a<00:00:35.309> shallow<00:00:35.579> pan<00:00:35.940> and<00:00:36.329> I<00:00:36.420> don't<00:00:36.540> know<00:00:36.719> it

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
or a shallow pan and I don't know it

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.990 
or a shallow pan and I don't know it
didn't<00:00:37.079> say<00:00:37.260> on<00:00:37.469> it<00:00:37.649> and<00:00:37.800> I<00:00:38.579> did<00:00:38.760> quite<00:00:38.879> a<00:00:38.940> bit

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
didn't say on it and I did quite a bit

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.340 
didn't say on it and I did quite a bit
of<00:00:39.180> reading<00:00:39.270> on<00:00:39.510> the<00:00:39.600> web<00:00:39.750> and<00:00:39.960> what<00:00:40.079> I<00:00:40.110> could

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
of reading on the web and what I could

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.709 
of reading on the web and what I could
find<00:00:40.710> was<00:00:41.040> people<00:00:41.340> that<00:00:41.460> say<00:00:41.670> that<00:00:41.700> the<00:00:42.480> pan

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
find was people that say that the pan

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.080 
find was people that say that the pan
has<00:00:42.960> a<00:00:42.989> step<00:00:43.410> up<00:00:43.649> like<00:00:43.950> obviously<00:00:44.670> this<00:00:44.850> is<00:00:44.969> the

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
has a step up like obviously this is the

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.119 
has a step up like obviously this is the
inside<00:00:45.390> of<00:00:45.420> a<00:00:45.539> pan<00:00:45.719> I've<00:00:45.870> got<00:00:46.020> it<00:00:46.140> off<00:00:46.260> they'd

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
inside of a pan I've got it off they'd

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:50.450 
inside of a pan I've got it off they'd
say<00:00:47.340> that<00:00:47.520> this<00:00:47.640> is<00:00:47.820> a<00:00:47.850> step<00:00:48.210> up<00:00:49.039> and<00:00:50.039> on<00:00:50.370> the

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
say that this is a step up and on the

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.100 
say that this is a step up and on the
underside<00:00:50.910> of<00:00:50.940> this<00:00:51.120> would<00:00:51.300> be<00:00:51.420> a<00:00:51.449> crossmember

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
underside of this would be a crossmember

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.490 
underside of this would be a crossmember
for<00:00:52.289> your<00:00:52.410> exhaust<00:00:53.309> I<00:00:53.579> guess<00:00:53.789> I'm<00:00:54.690> hearing

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
for your exhaust I guess I'm hearing

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.000 
for your exhaust I guess I'm hearing
people<00:00:55.710> call<00:00:55.890> that<00:00:56.039> a<00:00:56.070> deep<00:00:56.309> pan<00:00:56.579> and<00:00:58.010> anyway

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
people call that a deep pan and anyway

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.069 
people call that a deep pan and anyway
so<00:00:59.160> that's<00:00:59.579> what<00:00:59.820> people<00:01:00.300> say<00:01:00.539> is<00:01:00.629> a<00:01:00.690> deep<00:01:00.870> pan

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
so that's what people say is a deep pan

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:02.630 
so that's what people say is a deep pan
there<00:01:01.500> are<00:01:01.620> people<00:01:01.949> that<00:01:02.010> don't<00:01:02.129> seem<00:01:02.370> to<00:01:02.489> know

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
there are people that don't seem to know

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.479 
there are people that don't seem to know
and<00:01:02.910> I<00:01:03.719> don't<00:01:04.470> claim<00:01:04.619> to<00:01:04.680> be<00:01:04.769> the<00:01:04.920> expert<00:01:05.309> but

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489

fuller Drive and I have the shallow pan
and<00:01:25.979> anyway<00:01:26.280> there's<00:01:26.549> a<00:01:26.610> bunch<00:01:26.790> of<00:01:26.970> the<00:01:27.689> only

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
and anyway there's a bunch of the only

and anyway there's a bunch of the only
thing<00:01:28.080> that<00:01:28.200> seems<00:01:28.380> to<00:01:28.409> be<00:01:28.530> consistent<00:01:29.100> is

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
thing that seems to be consistent is

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.039 
thing that seems to be consistent is
people<00:01:29.460> say<00:01:29.610> that<00:01:29.790> this<00:01:29.939> lip<00:01:30.180> tells<00:01:30.780> you<00:01:30.930> that

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
people say that this lip tells you that

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:32.690 
people say that this lip tells you that
it's<00:01:31.200> a<00:01:31.259> deep<00:01:31.409> pan<00:01:31.650> so<00:01:32.280> I<00:01:32.310> thought<00:01:32.490> I'd<00:01:32.610> just

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
it's a deep pan so I thought I'd just

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:38.420 
it's a deep pan so I thought I'd just
measure<00:01:32.970> it<00:01:33.150> for<00:01:33.329> you<00:01:33.479> and<00:01:36.799> there<00:01:37.799> we<00:01:37.890> go<00:01:38.100> it

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430

just about at the three inch mark deep
that's<00:01:47.759> at<00:01:47.909> the<00:01:48.030> deep<00:01:48.210> end<00:01:48.420> of<00:01:48.540> the<00:01:48.600> pan<00:01:48.840> and<00:01:49.110> I

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
that's at the deep end of the pan and I

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:53.149 
that's at the deep end of the pan and I
saw<00:01:50.399> one<00:01:51.119> guy<00:01:51.149> who<00:01:51.390> said<00:01:51.780> the<00:01:51.990> shallow<00:01:52.560> pan<00:01:52.920> was

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
saw one guy who said the shallow pan was

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.069 
saw one guy who said the shallow pan was
two<00:01:53.310> and<00:01:53.430> a<00:01:53.490> quarter<00:01:53.670> inches<00:01:54.030> deep<00:01:54.270> and<00:01:54.450> the

deep<00:01:57.600> I'm<00:01:58.110> calling<00:01:58.500> this<00:01:58.619> three<00:01:58.920> so<00:01:59.250> I<00:01:59.490> guess<00:01:59.909> I

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
deep I'm calling this three so I guess I

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:01.670 
deep I'm calling this three so I guess I
would<00:02:00.360> agree<00:02:00.630> with<00:02:00.750> that<00:02:00.810> guy<00:02:01.110> that<00:02:01.380> would<00:02:01.530> say

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
would agree with that guy that would say

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.760 
would agree with that guy that would say
this<00:02:01.829> is<00:02:01.979> a<00:02:02.030> deep<00:02:03.030> pan<00:02:03.299> now<00:02:03.659> you<00:02:04.170> got<00:02:04.320> a<00:02:04.350> magnet

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
this is a deep pan now you got a magnet

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.490 
this is a deep pan now you got a magnet
here<00:02:04.799> that<00:02:05.189> picks<00:02:05.460> up<00:02:05.640> junk<00:02:06.240> and<00:02:06.509> you<00:02:06.540> get<00:02:07.409> the

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
here that picks up junk and you get the

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.589 
here that picks up junk and you get the
drain<00:02:07.710> plug<00:02:07.890> here<00:02:08.250> and<00:02:08.429> this<00:02:09.060> drain<00:02:09.270> plug<00:02:09.509> I

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
drain plug here and this drain plug I

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:10.960 
drain plug here and this drain plug I
believe<00:02:09.959> was<00:02:10.440> 15

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:10.970 
believe was 15

probably ought to find it now to sit no
it's<00:03:53.480> right<00:03:53.660> about<00:03:53.930> that<00:03:54.310> anyway<00:03:55.310> I<00:03:55.340> actually

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:55.640 
it's right about that anyway I actually

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:58.660 
it's right about that anyway I actually
bent<00:03:56.120> my<00:03:56.360> T<00:03:56.930> 40<00:03:57.320> socket<00:03:57.799> it's<00:03:57.920> not<00:03:58.100> straight

bent my T 40 socket it's not straight
anymore<00:03:58.700> that<00:03:59.269> thought<00:03:59.900> it<00:03:59.959> was<00:03:59.989> going<00:04:00.200> to

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:00.260 
anymore that thought it was going to

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:02.590 
anymore that thought it was going to

actually twist off those down bolts are
in<00:04:02.690> there<00:04:02.840> so<00:04:02.989> tight<00:04:03.350> I<00:04:03.590> could<00:04:04.010> not<00:04:04.190> get<00:04:04.459> them

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:04.580 
in there so tight I could not get them

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:07.870 
in there so tight I could not get them
off<00:04:05.140> okay<00:04:06.140> what<00:04:06.500> I<00:04:06.530> ended<00:04:06.769> up<00:04:06.860> doing<00:04:07.190> is<00:04:07.370> I

cover<00:04:13.610> so<00:04:14.209> that<00:04:14.239> I<00:04:14.360> could<00:04:14.570> get<00:04:14.750> it<00:04:14.840> off<00:04:14.959> I

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:15.170 
cover so that I could get it off I

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:17.080 
cover so that I could get it off I
really<00:04:15.470> feel<00:04:15.650> sick<00:04:15.950> of<00:04:16.130> doing<00:04:16.430> that<00:04:16.700> bending

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:17.090 
really feel sick of doing that bending

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:19.270 
really feel sick of doing that bending
that's<00:04:17.269> poor<00:04:18.109> practice<00:04:18.680> and<00:04:18.890> I'm<00:04:18.979> kind<00:04:19.220> of

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:19.280 
that's poor practice and I'm kind of

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:21.039 
that's poor practice and I'm kind of
embarrassed<00:04:19.430> to<00:04:19.760> say<00:04:19.910> it<00:04:19.940> but<00:04:20.239> I've<00:04:20.900> heard

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:21.049 
embarrassed to say it but I've heard

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:22.460 
embarrassed to say it but I've heard
about<00:04:21.169> other<00:04:21.470> people<00:04:21.739> doing<00:04:21.859> it<00:04:22.010> and<00:04:22.160> that's

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:22.470 
about other people doing it and that's

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:24.650 
about other people doing it and that's
exactly<00:04:22.830> how<00:04:22.920> I<00:04:22.950> had<00:04:23.250> to<00:04:23.280> do<00:04:23.460> it<00:04:23.610> so<00:04:24.180> I<00:04:24.210> bent<00:04:24.480> it

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:24.660 
exactly how I had to do it so I bent it

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:26.030 
exactly how I had to do it so I bent it
and<00:04:24.780> in<00:04:24.900> fact<00:04:25.110> in<00:04:25.350> order<00:04:25.470> to<00:04:25.620> get<00:04:25.740> enough<00:04:25.890> room

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:26.040 
and in fact in order to get enough room

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:27.830 
and in fact in order to get enough room
to<00:04:26.070> work<00:04:26.310> there<00:04:26.520> had<00:04:26.910> to<00:04:27.030> detach<00:04:27.330> my<00:04:27.570> front

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:27.840 
to work there had to detach my front

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:30.320 
to work there had to detach my front
drive<00:04:28.080> shaft<00:04:28.370> strangely<00:04:29.370> enough<00:04:29.550> the<00:04:29.850> not<00:04:30.150> the

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:30.330 
drive shaft strangely enough the not the

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:31.790 
drive shaft strangely enough the not the
bolts<00:04:30.600> that<00:04:30.660> hold<00:04:30.780> the<00:04:30.870> front<00:04:30.960> drive<00:04:31.350> shaft<00:04:31.620> on

bolts that hold the front drive shaft on

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:36.050 
bolts that hold the front drive shaft on
are<00:04:32.070> 11<00:04:32.940> millimeter<00:04:33.680> bolts<00:04:34.680> head's<00:04:35.060> feels

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:36.060 
are 11 millimeter bolts head's feels

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:37.910 
are 11 millimeter bolts head's feels
like<00:04:36.210> a<00:04:36.270> 10<00:04:36.450> will<00:04:36.600> go<00:04:36.690> on<00:04:36.840> and<00:04:37.110> my<00:04:37.620> chef

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:37.920 
like a 10 will go on and my chef

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:40.160 
like a 10 will go on and my chef
quarter-ton<00:04:38.370> had<00:04:38.610> tens<00:04:38.850> but<00:04:39.180> these<00:04:39.780> are<00:04:39.930> 11

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:40.170 
quarter-ton had tens but these are 11

quarter-ton had tens but these are 11
millimeter<00:04:40.680> bolts<00:04:41.040> so<00:04:41.280> I<00:04:41.460> would<00:04:42.210> bring<00:04:42.360> the<00:04:42.510> X

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:42.660 
millimeter bolts so I would bring the X

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:44.840 
millimeter bolts so I would bring the X
out<00:04:42.810> of<00:04:42.960> that<00:04:43.080> but<00:04:43.320> that's<00:04:43.980> it<00:04:44.190> and<00:04:44.310> while<00:04:44.700> I'm

out of that but that's it and while I'm
down<00:04:45.030> here<00:04:47.030> again<00:04:48.030> probably<00:04:48.420> can't<00:04:48.570> see<00:04:48.690> it

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:48.720 
down here again probably can't see it

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:52.070 
down here again probably can't see it

to<00:05:15.300> get<00:05:15.419> the<00:05:15.510> top<00:05:15.690> connector<00:05:16.200> off<00:05:16.350> and<00:05:16.880> and<00:05:17.880> it

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:18.540 
to get the top connector off and and it

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:20.240 
to get the top connector off and and it
I<00:05:18.810> felt<00:05:19.050> I<00:05:19.169> was<00:05:19.200> going<00:05:19.380> to<00:05:19.440> fire<00:05:19.620> it's<00:05:19.800> fracture

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:20.250 
I felt I was going to fire it's fracture

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:22.159 
I felt I was going to fire it's fracture
the<00:05:20.340> whole<00:05:20.490> housing<00:05:20.700> anyway<00:05:21.660> the<00:05:21.870> good<00:05:21.990> news

00:05:22.159 --> 00:05:22.169 
the whole housing anyway the good news

00:05:22.169 --> 00:05:23.510 
the whole housing anyway the good news
is<00:05:22.350> those<00:05:22.590> connectors<00:05:22.980> don't<00:05:23.190> have<00:05:23.340> to<00:05:23.400> come

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:23.520 
is those connectors don't have to come

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:25.070 
is those connectors don't have to come
off<00:05:23.640> to<00:05:23.760> do<00:05:23.850> the<00:05:23.970> transmission<00:05:24.480> fluid<00:05:24.600> filter

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:25.080 
off to do the transmission fluid filter

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:30.170 
off to do the transmission fluid filter
but<00:05:26.180> but<00:05:27.260> yeah<00:05:28.260> it's<00:05:28.710> a<00:05:28.800> real<00:05:28.980> pain<00:05:29.160> now<00:05:29.880> the

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:30.180 
but but yeah it's a real pain now the

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:33.020 
but but yeah it's a real pain now the
next<00:05:30.419> problem<00:05:30.540> I<00:05:30.810> got<00:05:30.990> here<00:05:31.290> is<00:05:31.640> I<00:05:32.640> read<00:05:32.850> online

that if you're not careful when you take

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:37.040 
that if you're not careful when you take
this<00:05:35.490> pan<00:05:35.760> off<00:05:35.940> you<00:05:36.360> can<00:05:36.540> fracture<00:05:36.960> the

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:37.050 
this pan off you can fracture the

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:39.350 
this pan off you can fracture the
solenoids<00:05:37.590> and<00:05:37.770> here<00:05:38.340> are<00:05:38.430> two<00:05:38.550> solenoids<00:05:38.850> and

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:39.360 
solenoids and here are two solenoids and

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:44.330 
solenoids and here are two solenoids and
this<00:05:40.229> one<00:05:40.470> is<00:05:40.890> very<00:05:41.070> rigid<00:05:42.030> in<00:05:42.300> its<00:05:43.340> housing

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:44.340 
this one is very rigid in its housing

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:47.210 
this one is very rigid in its housing
this<00:05:45.270> one<00:05:45.600> you<00:05:46.080> can<00:05:46.260> see<00:05:46.290> I<00:05:46.500> can<00:05:46.860> move<00:05:46.979> it<00:05:47.160> a

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:47.220 
this one you can see I can move it a

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:51.140 
this one you can see I can move it a
little<00:05:47.250> bit<00:05:47.720> and<00:05:49.340> I'm<00:05:50.340> not<00:05:50.550> pulling<00:05:50.940> on<00:05:51.030> it

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:51.150 
little bit and I'm not pulling on it

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:52.670 
little bit and I'm not pulling on it
very<00:05:51.270> hard<00:05:51.390> but<00:05:51.690> I<00:05:51.840> can<00:05:52.080> wiggle<00:05:52.260> it<00:05:52.440> back<00:05:52.470> and

00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:52.680 
very hard but I can wiggle it back and

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:55.310 
very hard but I can wiggle it back and
forth<00:05:52.919> and<00:05:53.580> I<00:05:54.090> hope<00:05:54.330> I<00:05:54.479> didn't<00:05:54.840> but<00:05:54.990> maybe<00:05:55.140> I

anybody knows if that amount of play is
normal<00:06:10.250> you<00:06:11.250> can<00:06:11.400> actually<00:06:11.550> see<00:06:11.880> the<00:06:12.000> little

whether that play is normal I'd love to
know<00:06:25.610> and<00:06:27.010> hopefully<00:06:28.010> your<00:06:28.160> transmission

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:28.730 
know and hopefully your transmission

00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:30.910 
know and hopefully your transmission

00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:35.480 
pan back on all that stuff and then I'm

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:36.820 
pan back on all that stuff and then I'm
going<00:06:35.600> to<00:06:35.660> disconnect<00:06:36.020> the<00:06:36.260> line<00:06:36.440> from<00:06:36.770> the

going to disconnect the line from the

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:39.700 
going to disconnect the line from the
radiator<00:06:37.760> and<00:06:38.110> hopefully<00:06:39.110> pump<00:06:39.380> the<00:06:39.500> torque

00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:39.710

sessions of pumping it out I've read
online<00:06:57.530> that<00:06:57.860> these<00:06:58.280> GM's<00:06:59.090> need<00:06:59.390> a<00:06:59.420> special

00:06:59.860 --> 00:06:59.870

online that these GM's need a special
tool<00:07:00.110> to<00:07:00.920> disconnect<00:07:01.100> the<00:07:02.020> red<00:07:03.020> connection

for the for the transmission line I

00:07:05.630 --> 00:07:07.510 
for the for the transmission line I
guess<00:07:05.990> I'll<00:07:06.170> figure<00:07:06.770> that<00:07:07.010> out<00:07:07.130> when<00:07:07.340> I<00:07:07.370> get

00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:07.520 
guess I'll figure that out when I get

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:08.740 
guess I'll figure that out when I get
there<00:07:07.580> I<00:07:07.760> haven't<00:07:08.060> looked<00:07:08.210> that<00:07:08.300> far<00:07:08.360> yet<00:07:08.690> but
