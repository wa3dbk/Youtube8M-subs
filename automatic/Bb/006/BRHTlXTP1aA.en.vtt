00:00:07.989 --> 00:00:12.059
 a feat accomplished by jenson barton is certainly destined to remain in the 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:16.650
 history of formula 1 for a long time probably never was forever 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.110
 having seen a driver in a Formula 1 race on a city track he will succeed in 

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:25.310
 win on the last lap after making 6 pit stops in the same race 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:29.279
 having had two bankruptcy incidents punctured a penalty with passing into 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:33.590
 pit lane is a recovery of the twenty-first position to the first 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:36.870
 we would just miss someone saying he was lucky 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:42.170
 a superb test of speedy stubbornness and above all intelligence 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:46.980
 to come first from the twenty-first place means that jenson has done at least 10 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.510
 overtaking in asphalt conditions in constant evolution firefighter essence 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:52.170
 Rome 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.980
 just think that a single dubbing here was perhaps a little bit 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:59.740
 a dubbing is not an overtaking for the position 

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:04.070
 a friend of mine tennis player davide carpi often repeats in the field in sport 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:08.800
 the categories exist and he is quite right batonnage had been accused 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:12.690
 not even so veiled as to do that insiders have won a 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:16.580
 world-wide only because labrone was irregular is fortunately 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:20.470
 proving to be a pilot worthy of the title of champion of 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:20.960
 world 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:25.000
 and having to be absolutely considered as one of the favorites for the 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.740
 winning another world title in the near future a day 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.520
 euphoric for fan drivers who could also have ended up with the 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.200
 disqualifies a penalty imposed on English 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:39.730
 due to the two container accidents with alonso in both cases it was 

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:43.180
 considered that the clashes were categorized as normal episodes of 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:46.619
 clear between the two incidents we had seemed more at risk than with 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:47.310
 hemilton 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.890
 as at first sight the trajectory set. he wanted to lead too much 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:52.710
 the outside 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.910
 in reality the conditions of the asphalt required a setting of the 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:01:59.900
 trajectory pointing to a straight line initially to the left 

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:04.760
 to tackle perfectly straight wheels the corner of curve 1 later 

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:07.080
 having made a slight bend to the right 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:11.080
 jenson in the past has never performed obvious misconduct on the track in the 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:14.259
 race direction test certainly taken into account 

00:02:14.259 --> 00:02:18.299
 a superb race with commitment and deserved winner which seemed to be missing on 

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:22.829
 white horse the blue cape in those last 4 5 seemed to hunt a 

00:02:22.829 --> 00:02:25.749
 good and not a young world champion colleague 

00:02:25.749 --> 00:02:29.679
 the pressure those who have been able to put better battona already done 

00:02:29.679 --> 00:02:33.339
 jump on the chair with prey to the dance of san vito and see vettel that 

00:02:33.339 --> 00:02:37.379
 now it is no longer likeable even Canadian go to the pope was one 

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:40.450
 libido sometimes the sportiness should be left the part 

00:02:46.979 --> 00:02:49.979
 good
