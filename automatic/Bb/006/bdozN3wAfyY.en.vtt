00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.690 

I<00:00:08.990> like<00:00:09.990> to<00:00:10.139> think<00:00:10.410> of<00:00:10.530> painting<00:00:11.070> as<00:00:11.219> being

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700 
I like to think of painting as being

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.540 
I like to think of painting as being
this<00:00:12.469> this<00:00:13.469> kind<00:00:13.769> of<00:00:13.799> wonderful<00:00:14.370> and<00:00:15.139> bizarre

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:16.550 
this this kind of wonderful and bizarre

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:19.040 
this this kind of wonderful and bizarre
contradictory<00:00:17.550> thing<00:00:17.910> you<00:00:18.359> know<00:00:18.480> it's<00:00:18.720> it's

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
contradictory thing you know it's it's

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.290 
contradictory thing you know it's it's
like<00:00:19.199> it's<00:00:19.560> an<00:00:19.740> object<00:00:19.890> it's<00:00:20.400> a<00:00:20.490> window<00:00:20.880> you

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
like it's an object it's a window you

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.810 
like it's an object it's a window you
know<00:00:21.420> it's<00:00:21.630> it's<00:00:22.020> it's<00:00:22.470> you<00:00:23.430> know<00:00:23.550> this

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
know it's it's it's you know this

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.960 
know it's it's it's you know this
physical<00:00:24.449> object<00:00:25.170> but<00:00:25.500> also<00:00:25.529> it<00:00:26.099> becomes<00:00:26.820> a

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
physical object but also it becomes a

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.810 
physical object but also it becomes a
space<00:00:27.269> this<00:00:27.689> kind<00:00:27.900> of<00:00:28.019> you<00:00:28.830> know<00:00:28.859> removed

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
space this kind of you know removed

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.060 
space this kind of you know removed
space<00:00:30.269> in<00:00:30.599> a<00:00:30.689> way<00:00:30.720> so<00:00:30.869> it's<00:00:31.349> kind<00:00:31.650> of<00:00:31.769> here<00:00:32.040> and

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
space in a way so it's kind of here and

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.639 
space in a way so it's kind of here and
not<00:00:32.520> at<00:00:32.820> the<00:00:32.850> same<00:00:33.000> time<00:00:33.510> and<00:00:33.930> I<00:00:34.170> think<00:00:34.200> there's

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
not at the same time and I think there's

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:35.900 
not at the same time and I think there's
there's<00:00:35.280> something<00:00:35.579> that's<00:00:35.700> always

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
there's something that's always

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.729 
there's something that's always
fascinating<00:00:36.719> about<00:00:36.840> that<00:00:37.110> I<00:00:37.140> think<00:00:37.380> you<00:00:37.620> know

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
fascinating about that I think you know

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:43.340 
fascinating about that I think you know
there's<00:00:37.980> there's<00:00:38.430> a<00:00:38.489> whole<00:00:38.550> universe<00:00:38.730> in<00:00:39.450> that

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.350 

trying<00:00:43.530> to<00:00:43.620> figure<00:00:43.800> out<00:00:43.920> a<00:00:43.980> way<00:00:44.070> to<00:00:44.300> make<00:00:45.300> a

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
trying to figure out a way to make a

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.350 
trying to figure out a way to make a
painting<00:00:45.810> that<00:00:46.400> kind<00:00:47.400> of<00:00:47.460> developed<00:00:48.030> out<00:00:48.180> of

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
painting that kind of developed out of

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.979 
painting that kind of developed out of
itself<00:00:48.720> and<00:00:49.170> and<00:00:49.440> so<00:00:49.739> I<00:00:50.180> had<00:00:51.180> this<00:00:51.330> idea<00:00:51.510> of<00:00:51.840> the

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
itself and and so I had this idea of the

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:53.900 
itself and and so I had this idea of the
painting<00:00:52.410> having<00:00:52.620> an<00:00:52.800> internal<00:00:53.160> logic<00:00:53.400> that

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
painting having an internal logic that

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.610 
painting having an internal logic that
it<00:00:54.030> kind<00:00:54.239> of<00:00:54.300> grew<00:00:54.809> out<00:00:54.840> of<00:00:55.050> so<00:00:57.260> working<00:00:58.260> around

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
it kind of grew out of so working around

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.250 
it kind of grew out of so working around
this<00:00:58.710> kind<00:00:58.920> of<00:00:59.100> ideas<00:00:59.790> loose<00:01:00.629> notion<00:01:01.140> of

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
this kind of ideas loose notion of

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.729 
this kind of ideas loose notion of
symmetry<00:01:01.830> I<00:01:01.860> think<00:01:02.420> was<00:01:03.420> what<00:01:03.660> what<00:01:04.019> spawned

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
symmetry I think was what what spawned

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.630 
symmetry I think was what what spawned
these<00:01:05.040> paintings<00:01:06.410> but<00:01:07.410> then<00:01:07.590> I<00:01:07.619> you<00:01:08.100> know<00:01:08.250> in

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
these paintings but then I you know in

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.969 
these paintings but then I you know in
playing<00:01:09.570> around<00:01:09.780> with<00:01:09.960> that<00:01:10.140> idea<00:01:10.530> I<00:01:10.619> got

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
playing around with that idea I got

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:15.620 
playing around with that idea I got
really<00:01:11.280> interested<00:01:11.610> in<00:01:13.880> kind<00:01:14.880> of<00:01:14.970> you<00:01:15.479> know

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
really interested in kind of you know

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.109 
really interested in kind of you know
this<00:01:16.229> replication<00:01:16.830> of<00:01:17.070> the<00:01:17.250> mark<00:01:17.520> going<00:01:17.940> back

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
this replication of the mark going back

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.150 
this replication of the mark going back
and<00:01:18.360> forth<00:01:18.660> you<00:01:18.869> know<00:01:19.170> I'll<00:01:19.500> make<00:01:19.530> a<00:01:19.710> mark<00:01:19.950> on

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:20.160 
and forth you know I'll make a mark on

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:22.190 
and forth you know I'll make a mark on
one<00:01:20.369> side<00:01:20.670> move<00:01:21.090> to<00:01:21.270> the<00:01:21.390> other<00:01:21.479> side<00:01:21.780> and<00:01:22.020> try

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
one side move to the other side and try

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.529 
one side move to the other side and try
to<00:01:22.350> replicate<00:01:22.979> it<00:01:23.369> to<00:01:23.729> you<00:01:24.000> know<00:01:24.119> to<00:01:24.180> some

00:01:24.529 --> 00:01:24.539 
to replicate it to you know to some

00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:28.820 
to replicate it to you know to some
degree<00:01:24.930> and<00:01:25.580> the<00:01:26.580> kind<00:01:27.390> of<00:01:27.830> inherent

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:28.830 
degree and the kind of inherent

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:32.749 
degree and the kind of inherent
impossibility<00:01:29.430> of<00:01:29.789> that<00:01:30.920> that<00:01:31.920> that<00:01:32.250> scheme

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
impossibility of that that that scheme

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:36.230 
impossibility of that that that scheme
that<00:01:33.060> plan<00:01:34.280> things<00:01:35.280> start<00:01:35.550> to<00:01:35.610> get<00:01:35.759> thrown<00:01:36.060> off

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
that plan things start to get thrown off

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.260 
that plan things start to get thrown off
then<00:01:36.600> the<00:01:36.840> symmetry<00:01:37.200> is<00:01:37.470> there<00:01:37.710> more<00:01:37.920> of<00:01:38.070> an

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:38.270 
then the symmetry is there more of an

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:41.870 
then the symmetry is there more of an
idea<00:01:39.270> than<00:01:39.390> an<00:01:39.750> actual<00:01:40.140> fact<00:01:40.440> you<00:01:40.800> know<00:01:41.039> so

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
idea than an actual fact you know so

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.600 
idea than an actual fact you know so
there's<00:01:42.479> just<00:01:42.690> so<00:01:42.810> this<00:01:43.080> it<00:01:43.950> starts<00:01:44.280> to<00:01:44.429> get

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
there's just so this it starts to get

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.859 
there's just so this it starts to get
kind<00:01:44.759> of<00:01:44.880> absurd<00:01:45.270> in<00:01:45.539> a<00:01:45.630> way<00:01:47.000> and<00:01:48.000> and<00:01:48.509> I<00:01:48.630> think

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
kind of absurd in a way and and I think

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.080 
kind of absurd in a way and and I think
that's<00:01:49.049> really<00:01:49.530> where<00:01:49.740> that<00:01:49.979> the<00:01:50.250> work<00:01:50.460> hinges

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
that's really where that the work hinges

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:52.910 
that's really where that the work hinges
it<00:01:51.390> hinges<00:01:51.780> on<00:01:51.960> that<00:01:52.020> not<00:01:52.439> the<00:01:52.619> fact<00:01:52.830> that

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
it hinges on that not the fact that

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.200 
it hinges on that not the fact that
they're<00:01:53.130> symmetrical<00:01:53.729> but<00:01:53.820> the<00:01:53.939> fact<00:01:54.150> that

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
they're symmetrical but the fact that

00:01:54.210 --> 00:02:00.419 
they're symmetrical but the fact that
they're<00:01:54.450> really<00:01:54.960> not<00:01:55.380> symmetrical<00:01:56.100> at<00:01:56.220> all

00:02:00.419 --> 00:02:00.429 

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:04.789 

I've<00:02:00.969> often<00:02:01.750> kind<00:02:02.109> of<00:02:02.289> thought<00:02:02.560> one<00:02:02.799> of<00:02:02.920> the

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
I've often kind of thought one of the

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:08.070 
I've often kind of thought one of the
central<00:02:05.799> mysteries<00:02:06.549> of<00:02:07.060> painting<00:02:07.600> if<00:02:07.750> she<00:02:07.899> was

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:08.080 
central mysteries of painting if she was

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:12.030 
central mysteries of painting if she was
the<00:02:08.470> the<00:02:08.769> idea<00:02:09.250> of<00:02:09.399> the<00:02:09.750> mark<00:02:10.840> can<00:02:11.140> a<00:02:11.440> mark<00:02:11.739> or<00:02:11.950> a

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.040 
the the idea of the mark can a mark or a

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:15.150 
the the idea of the mark can a mark or a
gesture<00:02:12.519> a<00:02:12.550> blob<00:02:13.420> of<00:02:13.450> paint<00:02:13.720> can<00:02:14.200> be<00:02:14.230> two

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:15.160 
gesture a blob of paint can be two

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:17.550 
gesture a blob of paint can be two
things<00:02:15.400> at<00:02:15.700> once<00:02:15.910> it<00:02:16.150> can<00:02:16.300> be<00:02:16.690> that<00:02:16.900> material

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
things at once it can be that material

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:20.900 
things at once it can be that material
and<00:02:17.709> then<00:02:17.799> it<00:02:17.980> can<00:02:18.160> you<00:02:19.120> know<00:02:19.180> take<00:02:19.480> on<00:02:19.660> another

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
and then it can you know take on another

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:23.430 
and then it can you know take on another
you<00:02:21.910> know<00:02:22.000> their<00:02:22.180> kind<00:02:22.330> of<00:02:22.450> existence<00:02:23.080> in<00:02:23.349> a

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.440 
you know their kind of existence in a
