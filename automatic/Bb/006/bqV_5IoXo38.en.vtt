00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:55.190 
there's going to be some adversity and
so<00:01:54.299> it's<00:01:54.389> going<00:01:54.479> to<00:01:54.539> be<00:01:54.659> interesting<00:01:54.810> to<00:01:55.020> see

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
so it's going to be interesting to see

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.949 
so it's going to be interesting to see
how<00:01:55.229> we<00:01:55.350> handle<00:01:55.710> that<00:01:55.859> and<00:01:56.450> you<00:01:57.450> know<00:01:57.569> bottle

00:01:57.949 --> 00:01:57.959 
how we handle that and you know bottle

00:01:57.959 --> 00:01:59.719 
how we handle that and you know bottle
that<00:01:58.079> hopefully<00:01:58.560> into<00:01:58.979> a<00:01:59.009> positive<00:01:59.249> attitude

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
that hopefully into a positive attitude

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:02.599 
that hopefully into a positive attitude
and<00:02:00.149> not<00:02:00.959> let<00:02:01.109> its<00:02:01.259> you<00:02:01.889> know<00:02:02.009> snowball<00:02:02.429> into<00:02:02.520> a

00:02:02.599 --> 00:02:02.609 
and not let its you know snowball into a

00:02:02.609 --> 00:02:04.669 
and not let its you know snowball into a
negative<00:02:02.939> one<00:02:03.109> one<00:02:04.109> of<00:02:04.170> the<00:02:04.289> stats<00:02:04.560> that

00:02:04.669 --> 00:02:04.679 
negative one one of the stats that

00:02:04.679 --> 00:02:06.379 
negative one one of the stats that
really<00:02:04.920> jumps<00:02:05.249> out<00:02:05.340> off<00:02:05.579> the<00:02:05.759> page<00:02:05.969> to<00:02:06.209> you<00:02:06.299> is

00:02:06.379 --> 00:02:06.389 
really jumps out off the page to you is

00:02:06.389 --> 00:02:09.020 
really jumps out off the page to you is
the<00:02:06.509> fact<00:02:06.689> that<00:02:06.899> no<00:02:07.259> team<00:02:07.590> in<00:02:07.619> 17<00:02:08.369> games<00:02:08.399> so<00:02:09.000> far

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
the fact that no team in 17 games so far

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:10.669 
the fact that no team in 17 games so far
against<00:02:09.479> the<00:02:09.539> Tigers<00:02:09.959> has<00:02:10.110> shot<00:02:10.350> better<00:02:10.560> than

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
against the Tigers has shot better than

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:13.490 
against the Tigers has shot better than
fifty<00:02:11.190> percent<00:02:11.520> from<00:02:12.209> the<00:02:12.270> field<00:02:12.630> in<00:02:13.080> both<00:02:13.319> the

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
fifty percent from the field in both the

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.140 
fifty percent from the field in both the
head<00:02:13.650> coach<00:02:13.890> and<00:02:14.130> his<00:02:14.310> players<00:02:14.580> will<00:02:14.850> tell<00:02:15.000> you

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
head coach and his players will tell you

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:16.640 
head coach and his players will tell you
it's<00:02:15.360> all<00:02:15.510> because<00:02:15.900> of<00:02:15.930> the<00:02:16.110> defense<00:02:16.200> of

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
it's all because of the defense of

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:19.670 
it's all because of the defense of
philosophy<00:02:17.280> I<00:02:17.690> think<00:02:18.690> we've<00:02:18.780> had<00:02:18.900> good<00:02:19.470> ball

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
philosophy I think we've had good ball

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:23.630 
philosophy I think we've had good ball
pressure<00:02:20.300> in<00:02:21.300> terms<00:02:21.689> of<00:02:22.010> not<00:02:23.010> allowing<00:02:23.340> guys

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
pressure in terms of not allowing guys

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.460 
pressure in terms of not allowing guys
to<00:02:23.849> get<00:02:23.939> too<00:02:24.120> many<00:02:24.239> easy<00:02:24.450> look<00:02:24.720> certainly<00:02:25.230> and

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
to get too many easy look certainly and

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:26.990 
to get too many easy look certainly and
I<00:02:25.769> think<00:02:25.950> we've<00:02:26.069> had<00:02:26.159> good<00:02:26.340> preparation<00:02:26.939> I

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
I think we've had good preparation I

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.480 
I think we've had good preparation I
think

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:27.490 
think

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:29.430 
think
have<00:02:27.580> done<00:02:27.760> a<00:02:27.790> good<00:02:27.940> job<00:02:28.000> of<00:02:28.230> coming<00:02:29.230> into

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:29.440 
have done a good job of coming into

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:31.740 
have done a good job of coming into
every<00:02:29.710> game<00:02:29.950> with<00:02:30.190> a<00:02:30.640> good<00:02:31.000> scouting<00:02:31.270> report

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
every game with a good scouting report

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:34.920 
every game with a good scouting report
we<00:02:31.930> spend<00:02:32.350> time<00:02:32.560> on<00:02:32.770> it<00:02:32.970> we<00:02:33.970> probably<00:02:34.240> walk

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:34.930 
we spend time on it we probably walk

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:36.630 
we spend time on it we probably walk
through<00:02:35.290> the<00:02:35.410> other<00:02:35.560> teams<00:02:35.890> actions<00:02:36.400> and

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640 
through the other teams actions and

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:37.890 
through the other teams actions and
things<00:02:36.820> and<00:02:37.000> how<00:02:37.060> we<00:02:37.120> want<00:02:37.360> to<00:02:37.420> guard<00:02:37.600> things

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:37.900 
things and how we want to guard things

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:41.430 
things and how we want to guard things
more<00:02:38.740> than<00:02:38.770> most<00:02:39.040> people<00:02:39.630> and<00:02:40.630> then<00:02:41.080> our<00:02:41.260> guys

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:41.440 
more than most people and then our guys

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:43.440 
more than most people and then our guys
have<00:02:41.710> begun<00:02:42.070> to<00:02:42.130> to<00:02:42.880> gain<00:02:43.090> some<00:02:43.270> confidence

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450 
have begun to to gain some confidence

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:45.000 
have begun to to gain some confidence
defensively<00:02:44.230> I<00:02:44.290> think<00:02:44.560> what<00:02:44.680> they've<00:02:44.800> tried

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.010 
defensively I think what they've tried

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:47.010 
defensively I think what they've tried
to<00:02:45.070> do<00:02:45.280> is<00:02:45.460> is<00:02:46.090> understand<00:02:46.570> that's<00:02:46.750> a<00:02:46.840> way<00:02:46.990> to

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:47.020 
to do is is understand that's a way to

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:48.900 
to do is is understand that's a way to
to<00:02:47.380> be<00:02:47.530> successful<00:02:48.130> maybe<00:02:48.460> when<00:02:48.640> you're<00:02:48.760> not

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:48.910 
to be successful maybe when you're not

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:50.970 
to be successful maybe when you're not
as<00:02:49.230> efficient<00:02:50.230> offensively<00:02:50.710> as<00:02:50.860> you'd<00:02:50.950> like

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:50.980 
as efficient offensively as you'd like

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:52.470 
as efficient offensively as you'd like
to<00:02:51.220> be<00:02:51.370> and<00:02:51.520> it's<00:02:51.640> just<00:02:51.910> become<00:02:52.150> a<00:02:52.180> little<00:02:52.390> bit

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 
to be and it's just become a little bit

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:55.470 
to be and it's just become a little bit
more<00:02:52.630> of<00:02:52.720> our<00:02:52.840> mindset<00:02:53.260> you<00:02:53.470> well<00:02:54.340> coach<00:02:55.300> Brown

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:55.480 
more of our mindset you well coach Brown

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:57.390 
more of our mindset you well coach Brown
never<00:02:55.690> really<00:02:55.930> talked<00:02:56.200> about<00:02:56.500> us<00:02:56.680> having<00:02:57.190> an

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:57.400 
never really talked about us having an

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:00.630 
never really talked about us having an
identity<00:02:57.910> and<00:02:58.600> you<00:02:59.470> know<00:02:59.590> we<00:03:00.100> really<00:03:00.280> go<00:03:00.520> into

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:00.640 
identity and you know we really go into

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:02.460 
identity and you know we really go into
every<00:03:00.850> game<00:03:01.120> with<00:03:01.330> a<00:03:01.360> defensive<00:03:01.720> mind<00:03:02.110> focus

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:02.470 
every game with a defensive mind focus

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:03.750 
every game with a defensive mind focus
and<00:03:02.680> we're<00:03:02.770> starting<00:03:03.040> to<00:03:03.130> take<00:03:03.280> pride<00:03:03.520> in<00:03:03.580> that

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:03.760 
and we're starting to take pride in that

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:06.900 
and we're starting to take pride in that
and<00:03:04.060> so<00:03:04.750> you<00:03:05.260> know<00:03:05.290> whenever<00:03:05.650> no<00:03:06.310> team<00:03:06.550> starts

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:06.910 
and so you know whenever no team starts

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:08.700 
and so you know whenever no team starts
shooting<00:03:07.120> well<00:03:07.330> on<00:03:07.630> us<00:03:08.200> you<00:03:08.410> know<00:03:08.560> we<00:03:08.680> really

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:08.710 
shooting well on us you know we really

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:10.500 
shooting well on us you know we really
get<00:03:09.100> upset<00:03:09.190> and<00:03:09.550> we<00:03:09.850> really<00:03:10.090> want<00:03:10.270> to<00:03:10.300> buckle

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:10.510 
get upset and we really want to buckle

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:12.810 
get upset and we really want to buckle
down<00:03:10.660> and<00:03:10.810> really<00:03:11.800> try<00:03:11.980> and<00:03:12.100> get<00:03:12.220> stops<00:03:12.520> and

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:12.820 
down and really try and get stops and

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:14.400 
down and really try and get stops and
you<00:03:13.180> know<00:03:13.270> I<00:03:13.330> think<00:03:13.630> that's<00:03:13.810> been<00:03:14.020> a<00:03:14.050> big<00:03:14.110> part

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:14.410 
you know I think that's been a big part

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:17.030 
you know I think that's been a big part
of<00:03:14.530> our<00:03:14.680> success<00:03:14.790> our<00:03:15.790> team<00:03:16.090> defenses<00:03:16.690> just

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 
of our success our team defenses just

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:19.380 
of our success our team defenses just
has<00:03:18.040> improved<00:03:18.400> throughout<00:03:18.700> the<00:03:18.850> season<00:03:19.210> I

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:19.390 
has improved throughout the season I

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:21.330 
has improved throughout the season I
think<00:03:19.630> you<00:03:19.750> know<00:03:19.900> when<00:03:20.110> we<00:03:20.230> played<00:03:20.470> we<00:03:21.310> played

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:21.340 
think you know when we played we played

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:23.550 
think you know when we played we played
Michigan<00:03:21.970> and<00:03:22.360> most<00:03:22.870> of<00:03:22.960> our<00:03:23.050> losses<00:03:23.290> you

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:23.560 
Michigan and most of our losses you

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:24.600 
Michigan and most of our losses you
could<00:03:23.710> see<00:03:23.890> we<00:03:24.010> were<00:03:24.040> kind<00:03:24.280> of<00:03:24.310> letting<00:03:24.520> down

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:24.610 
could see we were kind of letting down

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:27.300 
could see we were kind of letting down
the<00:03:24.670> defensive<00:03:25.240> end<00:03:25.330> and<00:03:25.980> brown<00:03:26.980> ale<00:03:27.160> is

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:27.310 
the defensive end and brown ale is

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:29.010 
the defensive end and brown ale is
really<00:03:27.640> harped<00:03:27.910> on<00:03:28.030> that<00:03:28.210> and<00:03:28.540> made<00:03:28.720> sure<00:03:28.750> that
