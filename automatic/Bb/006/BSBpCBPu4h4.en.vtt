is that a correct assessment yeah for

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.010 
is that a correct assessment yeah for
the<00:00:19.890> first<00:00:20.010> game<00:00:20.189> yeah<00:00:20.369> I<00:00:20.430> was<00:00:20.699> six<00:00:21.660> and<00:00:21.840> bands

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
the first game yeah I was six and bands

the first game yeah I was six and bands
were<00:00:22.140> really<00:00:22.439> bad<00:00:22.590> and<00:00:22.830> then<00:00:23.490> even<00:00:23.760> the<00:00:23.880> way<00:00:24.000> we

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
were really bad and then even the way we

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:27.200 
were really bad and then even the way we
play<00:00:24.330> wasn't<00:00:24.660> the<00:00:24.750> vessel<00:00:25.140> it's<00:00:25.920> it<00:00:26.369> was<00:00:26.519> a<00:00:26.550> bit

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
play wasn't the vessel it's it was a bit

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:28.609 
play wasn't the vessel it's it was a bit
of<00:00:27.300> everything<00:00:27.689> not<00:00:27.720> just<00:00:27.900> pick<00:00:28.199> somebody<00:00:28.380> who

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
of everything not just pick somebody who

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.080 
of everything not just pick somebody who
ya<00:00:28.740> when<00:00:29.220> i<00:00:29.250> was<00:00:29.400> talking<00:00:29.640> to<00:00:29.670> high<00:00:29.849> after

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
ya when i was talking to high after

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:31.820 
ya when i was talking to high after
because<00:00:30.570> you<00:00:30.689> picked<00:00:30.900> her<00:00:31.019> in<00:00:31.140> exon<00:00:31.439> versus

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
because you picked her in exon versus

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.340 
because you picked her in exon versus
kassadin<00:00:32.279> and<00:00:32.489> i<00:00:33.090> actually<00:00:33.360> thought<00:00:33.690> that<00:00:33.899> her

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
kassadin and i actually thought that her

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:35.630 
kassadin and i actually thought that her
next<00:00:34.500> one<00:00:34.620> will<00:00:34.710> do<00:00:34.800> pretty<00:00:35.010> well<00:00:35.160> and<00:00:35.309> I<00:00:35.399> said

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
next one will do pretty well and I said

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.400 
next one will do pretty well and I said
no<00:00:35.820> I<00:00:36.090> was<00:00:36.390> pretty<00:00:36.540> sure<00:00:36.780> I<00:00:36.809> was<00:00:36.930> going<00:00:37.170> to<00:00:37.260> beat

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
no I was pretty sure I was going to beat

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.880 
no I was pretty sure I was going to beat
him<00:00:37.820> well<00:00:38.820> I<00:00:39.300> think<00:00:39.420> it<00:00:39.809> will<00:00:39.930> have<00:00:40.110> equal<00:00:40.379> work

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
him well I think it will have equal work

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.040 
him well I think it will have equal work
a<00:00:41.070> lot<00:00:41.219> better<00:00:41.340> but<00:00:41.610> the<00:00:42.149> problem<00:00:42.480> is<00:00:42.600> I<00:00:42.690> didn't

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
a lot better but the problem is I didn't

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.220 
a lot better but the problem is I didn't
practice<00:00:43.649> it<00:00:43.739> enough<00:00:43.980> and<00:00:44.250> i<00:00:44.730> will<00:00:45.450> need<00:00:45.600> Sinai

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
practice it enough and i will need Sinai

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:47.779 
practice it enough and i will need Sinai
to<00:00:46.260> come<00:00:46.590> meet<00:00:46.739> a<00:00:46.920> lot<00:00:47.070> more<00:00:47.219> because<00:00:47.670> i<00:00:47.760> think

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
to come meet a lot more because i think

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:49.760 
to come meet a lot more because i think
we<00:00:48.000> can<00:00:48.149> kill<00:00:48.329> him<00:00:48.360> really<00:00:48.660> easily<00:00:48.960> early

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
just because of that because he also got

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:36.920 
just because of that because he also got
one<00:01:35.520> or<00:01:35.670> two<00:01:35.790> more<00:01:35.909> kills<00:01:36.119> after<00:01:36.479> on<00:01:36.600> cyanide

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
so that's so much coal I couldn't at

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:46.370 
so that's so much coal I couldn't at
that<00:01:45.540> point<00:01:45.689> I<00:01:45.810> couldn't<00:01:46.020> do<00:01:46.079> anything<00:01:46.110> I
