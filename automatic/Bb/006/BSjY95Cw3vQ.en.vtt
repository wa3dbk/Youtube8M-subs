on a glitch that i saw on some video
it's<00:00:11.309> a<00:00:11.670> rail<00:00:12.620> duplication<00:00:13.620> glitch<00:00:15.350> i<00:00:16.350> didn't

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
it's a rail duplication glitch i didn't

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:20.080 
it's a rail duplication glitch i didn't
find<00:00:17.220> this<00:00:17.430> i<00:00:17.699> have<00:00:18.630> came<00:00:19.140> up<00:00:19.410> with<00:00:19.650> my<00:00:19.920> own

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:20.090 
find this i have came up with my own

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:23.090 
find this i have came up with my own
idea<00:00:21.090> for<00:00:21.449> this<00:00:21.570> of<00:00:21.900> how<00:00:22.500> to<00:00:22.560> must<00:00:22.920> produce

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
idea for this of how to must produce

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.370 
idea for this of how to must produce
them<00:00:23.580> as<00:00:23.730> you<00:00:24.539> can<00:00:24.689> see<00:00:24.960> it<00:00:25.260> does<00:00:25.590> not<00:00:25.980> work<00:00:26.550> for

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:27.380 
them as you can see it does not work for

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:33.770 
them as you can see it does not work for
standard<00:00:28.380> rails<00:00:31.910> so<00:00:32.910> as<00:00:33.059> you<00:00:33.180> can<00:00:33.300> see<00:00:33.570> I've

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
standard rails so as you can see I've

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.319 
standard rails so as you can see I've
got<00:00:33.960> quite<00:00:34.110> a<00:00:34.200> big<00:00:34.350> setup<00:00:34.710> here<00:00:35.010> so<00:00:35.880> now<00:00:36.120> you'll

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
got quite a big setup here so now you'll

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.740 
got quite a big setup here so now you'll
be<00:00:36.390> building<00:00:36.840> your<00:00:37.850> minecraft<00:00:38.850> tracks<00:00:39.270> out<00:00:39.510> of

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
be building your minecraft tracks out of

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.410 
be building your minecraft tracks out of
powered<00:00:40.170> rails<00:00:40.410> instead<00:00:40.860> of<00:00:41.040> other<00:00:41.610> rails<00:00:42.180> if

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
powered rails instead of other rails if

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.840 
powered rails instead of other rails if
you<00:00:42.540> use<00:00:42.780> this<00:00:43.020> because<00:00:43.829> you<00:00:44.160> can<00:00:44.309> gather<00:00:44.489> so

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
you use this because you can gather so

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.170 
you use this because you can gather so
many<00:00:45.120> in<00:00:45.329> about<00:00:45.510> five<00:00:45.780> seconds<00:00:46.289> you<00:00:46.620> can<00:00:47.180> get

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
many in about five seconds you can get

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.490 
many in about five seconds you can get
easily<00:00:48.930> over<00:00:49.860> a<00:00:49.920> stack<00:00:50.449> or<00:00:51.449> more<00:00:51.840> probably

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
easily over a stack or more probably

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.799 
easily over a stack or more probably
quicker<00:00:52.949> than<00:00:53.190> that<00:00:53.250> actually<00:00:53.660> lejacq<00:00:54.660> see

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
quicker than that actually lejacq see

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:59.840 
quicker than that actually lejacq see
i'll<00:00:54.899> turn<00:00:55.110> it<00:00:55.289> on<00:00:55.469> here<00:00:58.430> see<00:00:59.430> it<00:00:59.550> start

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
i'll turn it on here see it start

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.539 
i'll turn it on here see it start
producing<00:01:00.270> them<00:01:00.859> you<00:01:01.859> run<00:01:02.070> down<00:01:02.100> there<00:01:02.550> and

00:01:04.539 --> 00:01:04.549 
producing them you run down there and

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:10.280 
producing them you run down there and
i've<00:01:05.549> got<00:01:05.850> over<00:01:06.479> a<00:01:06.630> start<00:01:07.049> easily<00:01:08.750> so<00:01:09.750> I've<00:01:10.049> let

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
i've got over a start easily so I've let

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.440 
i've got over a start easily so I've let
them<00:01:10.320> build<00:01:10.680> up<00:01:10.979> a<00:01:11.130> little<00:01:11.400> bit<00:01:11.549> now<00:01:11.729> and<00:01:11.970> we'll

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
them build up a little bit now and we'll

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.300 
them build up a little bit now and we'll
just<00:01:12.600> run<00:01:12.750> down<00:01:12.960> there<00:01:13.020> quickly<00:01:13.470> and<00:01:13.680> grab<00:01:14.280> a

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
just run down there quickly and grab a

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.880 
just run down there quickly and grab a
few<00:01:14.580> that<00:01:15.450> I<00:01:15.509> literally<00:01:16.200> was<00:01:16.409> gone<00:01:16.650> for<00:01:16.799> about

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
few that I literally was gone for about

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:24.649 
few that I literally was gone for about
20<00:01:17.580> seconds<00:01:18.030> mov<00:01:20.810> and<00:01:21.810> we've<00:01:22.409> got<00:01:22.650> loads<00:01:23.659> now

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
20 seconds mov and we've got loads now

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.679 
20 seconds mov and we've got loads now
the<00:01:25.259> way<00:01:25.409> in<00:01:25.590> which<00:01:26.040> this<00:01:26.310> works<00:01:26.729> or<00:01:27.180> the<00:01:27.540> way<00:01:27.659> I

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
the way in which this works or the way I

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.679 
the way in which this works or the way I
believe<00:01:28.049> it<00:01:28.439> works<00:01:28.799> is<00:01:29.220> all<00:01:29.790> gather<00:01:30.150> here<00:01:30.509> and

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
believe it works is all gather here and

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:33.380 
believe it works is all gather here and
show<00:01:30.840> you<00:01:30.990> want<00:01:31.140> a<00:01:31.200> singular<00:01:31.740> one<00:01:32.390> collector

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
show you want a singular one collector

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.649 
show you want a singular one collector
please<00:01:34.220> this<00:01:35.220> is<00:01:35.549> all<00:01:35.850> I<00:01:35.880> think<00:01:36.150> it<00:01:36.240> works<00:01:36.450> so

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
please this is all I think it works so

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:40.310 
please this is all I think it works so
basically<00:01:37.850> you<00:01:38.850> give<00:01:39.030> power<00:01:39.329> to<00:01:39.479> this<00:01:39.750> button

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
basically you give power to this button

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.160 
basically you give power to this button
and<00:01:40.590> it<00:01:41.100> keeps<00:01:41.369> it<00:01:42.150> down<00:01:42.360> and<00:01:42.720> it<00:01:42.960> gives<00:01:43.110> a

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
and it keeps it down and it gives a

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.480 
and it keeps it down and it gives a
really<00:01:43.200> quick<00:01:43.680> pulse<00:01:44.420> where<00:01:45.420> it<00:01:46.310> retract<00:01:47.310> by

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
really quick pulse where it retract by

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.780 
really quick pulse where it retract by
the<00:01:47.549> pistons<00:01:48.000> retract<00:01:48.479> and<00:01:48.840> it<00:01:49.590> is<00:01:49.790> extended

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
the pistons retract and it is extended

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.620 
the pistons retract and it is extended
for<00:01:50.970> a<00:01:51.000> long<00:01:51.180> time<00:01:51.450> so<00:01:51.780> and<00:01:52.110> then<00:01:52.619> when<00:01:52.829> the

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:53.630 
for a long time so and then when the

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:58.130 
for a long time so and then when the
Pistons<00:01:54.630> are<00:01:54.810> retracting<00:01:55.969> the<00:01:56.969> button<00:01:57.840> will

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
Pistons are retracting the button will

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.709 
Pistons are retracting the button will
power<00:01:58.439> the<00:01:58.920> blocks<00:01:59.490> to<00:01:59.820> the<00:01:59.850> side<00:01:59.969> of<00:02:00.240> it<00:02:00.570> in

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
power the blocks to the side of it in

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:02.990 
power the blocks to the side of it in
front<00:02:01.020> of<00:02:01.229> the<00:02:01.320> Pistons<00:02:01.799> as<00:02:01.979> well<00:02:02.219> which<00:02:02.790> will

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
front of the Pistons as well which will

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.600 
front of the Pistons as well which will
power<00:02:03.210> the<00:02:03.360> tracks<00:02:03.810> and<00:02:04.170> because<00:02:04.979> powered

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
power the tracks and because powered

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.809 
power the tracks and because powered
tracks<00:02:05.939> or<00:02:06.659> my<00:02:07.530> guesses<00:02:07.799> shouldn't<00:02:08.429> be<00:02:08.550> moved

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
tracks or my guesses shouldn't be moved

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:11.400 
tracks or my guesses shouldn't be moved
by<00:02:09.270> rail<00:02:09.750> and<00:02:10.200> by<00:02:10.530> a<00:02:10.770> pissed

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:11.410 
by rail and by a pissed

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:14.970 
by rail and by a pissed
and<00:02:11.470> they<00:02:11.950> pop<00:02:12.280> off<00:02:12.960> now<00:02:13.960> the<00:02:14.500> way<00:02:14.650> I<00:02:14.680> had<00:02:14.860> to

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:14.980 
and they pop off now the way I had to

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:17.610 
and they pop off now the way I had to
build<00:02:15.190> this<00:02:15.520> because<00:02:16.000> you<00:02:16.210> can't<00:02:16.480> have<00:02:16.900> it<00:02:17.230> has

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:17.620 
build this because you can't have it has

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:21.150 
build this because you can't have it has
to<00:02:17.770> be<00:02:17.860> a<00:02:17.890> quick<00:02:18.280> pulse<00:02:18.790> I<00:02:19.150> had<00:02:19.750> to<00:02:19.930> build<00:02:20.920> this

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:21.160 
to be a quick pulse I had to build this

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:24.060 
to be a quick pulse I had to build this
pole<00:02:21.520> short<00:02:21.880> and<00:02:22.000> the<00:02:22.060> hair<00:02:22.830> now<00:02:23.830> I<00:02:23.860> can

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:24.070 
pole short and the hair now I can

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:25.770 
pole short and the hair now I can
quickly<00:02:24.280> show<00:02:24.460> you<00:02:24.670> how<00:02:24.910> to<00:02:24.970> build<00:02:25.270> that<00:02:25.570> if

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780 
quickly show you how to build that if

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:27.630 
quickly show you how to build that if
you<00:02:26.020> would<00:02:26.170> like<00:02:26.350> so<00:02:27.010> I'll<00:02:27.100> just<00:02:27.160> get<00:02:27.520> the

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:30.450 
you would like so I'll just get the
materials<00:02:28.240> on<00:02:28.420> need<00:02:28.750> which<00:02:29.680> will<00:02:29.920> be<00:02:30.100> a

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:30.460 
materials on need which will be a

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:34.440 
materials on need which will be a
repeater<00:02:31.270> a<00:02:31.660> redstone<00:02:32.110> torch<00:02:32.470> and<00:02:33.190> a<00:02:34.120> pissed

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:34.450 
repeater a redstone torch and a pissed

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:38.130 
repeater a redstone torch and a pissed
on<00:02:35.550> the<00:02:36.550> repeater<00:02:36.910> takes<00:02:37.510> a<00:02:37.690> power<00:02:37.900> out

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:38.140 
on the repeater takes a power out

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:40.890 
on the repeater takes a power out
basically<00:02:38.590> so<00:02:39.400> you<00:02:39.460> just<00:02:39.880> thick<00:02:40.480> down<00:02:40.720> the

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:40.900 
basically so you just thick down the

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:45.270 
basically so you just thick down the
hole<00:02:41.080> in<00:02:42.010> a<00:02:42.670> hole<00:02:43.230> put<00:02:44.230> piston<00:02:44.740> to<00:02:44.890> the<00:02:44.980> side<00:02:45.250> of

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.280 
hole in a hole put piston to the side of

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.580 
hole in a hole put piston to the side of
it<00:02:45.550> very<00:02:45.790> Peter<00:02:46.750> on<00:02:46.930> the<00:02:47.020> side<00:02:47.230> way<00:02:47.380> you're<00:02:47.500> on

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 
it very Peter on the side way you're on

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:51.300 
it very Peter on the side way you're on
the<00:02:47.680> output<00:02:47.890> to<00:02:48.400> be<00:02:48.550> set<00:02:49.210> it<00:02:49.390> did<00:02:49.570> in<00:02:50.290> fact<00:02:50.500> i'll

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:51.310 
the output to be set it did in fact i'll

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:54.090 
the output to be set it did in fact i'll
explain<00:02:51.910> think<00:02:52.210> in<00:02:52.330> a<00:02:52.390> minute<00:02:52.720> and<00:02:52.900> then<00:02:53.100> you

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:54.100 
explain think in a minute and then you

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:57.630 
explain think in a minute and then you
put<00:02:54.310> that<00:02:54.550> there<00:02:54.870> that<00:02:55.870> here<00:02:56.260> and<00:02:56.890> this<00:02:57.190> block

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:57.640 
put that there that here and this block

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:59.640 
put that there that here and this block
this<00:02:58.120> side<00:02:58.390> of<00:02:58.540> the<00:02:58.600> block<00:02:58.780> here<00:02:59.110> will<00:02:59.350> be<00:02:59.500> your

00:02:59.640 --> 00:02:59.650 
this side of the block here will be your

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:04.680 
this side of the block here will be your
input<00:03:00.190> so<00:03:00.940> i<00:03:00.970> can<00:03:01.150> be<00:03:01.270> a<00:03:01.300> button<00:03:02.940> or<00:03:03.940> a<00:03:04.000> redstone

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:04.690 
input so i can be a button or a redstone

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:11.010 
input so i can be a button or a redstone
line<00:03:05.080> like<00:03:05.650> here<00:03:07.110> so<00:03:08.110> as<00:03:08.440> you<00:03:09.010> can<00:03:09.130> see<00:03:10.020> it

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:11.020 
line like here so as you can see it

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:13.830 
line like here so as you can see it
gives<00:03:11.320> a<00:03:11.440> very<00:03:11.470> short<00:03:11.950> pulse<00:03:12.280> out<00:03:12.490> to<00:03:12.670> this<00:03:12.850> and

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:13.840 
gives a very short pulse out to this and

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:16.650 
gives a very short pulse out to this and
now<00:03:13.960> when<00:03:14.110> this<00:03:14.260> travels<00:03:14.740> along<00:03:15.120> the<00:03:16.120> line<00:03:16.630> of

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:16.660 
now when this travels along the line of

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:24.960 
now when this travels along the line of
redstone<00:03:18.540> down<00:03:19.540> here<00:03:22.470> into<00:03:23.470> their<00:03:23.970> just

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:24.970 
redstone down here into their just

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:31.050 
redstone down here into their just
disconnect<00:03:25.600> that<00:03:28.890> it<00:03:29.890> will<00:03:30.040> only<00:03:30.160> Paul<00:03:30.670> this

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:31.060 
disconnect that it will only Paul this

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:34.230 
disconnect that it will only Paul this
I'll<00:03:31.540> just<00:03:31.780> use<00:03:32.080> these<00:03:32.290> to<00:03:32.350> demonstrate<00:03:33.240> okay

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:34.240 
I'll just use these to demonstrate okay

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:36.480 
I'll just use these to demonstrate okay
so<00:03:34.750> we'll<00:03:34.870> go<00:03:35.020> over<00:03:35.050> here<00:03:35.590> and<00:03:35.800> press<00:03:36.220> the

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:36.490 
so we'll go over here and press the

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:41.040 
so we'll go over here and press the
button<00:03:38.340> nothing<00:03:39.340> happens<00:03:39.600> you<00:03:40.600> have<00:03:40.720> to<00:03:40.870> set

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:41.050 
button nothing happens you have to set

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:43.170 
button nothing happens you have to set
this<00:03:41.170> to<00:03:41.380> two<00:03:41.709> and<00:03:41.980> that<00:03:42.489> gives<00:03:42.700> the<00:03:42.910> right

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:43.180 
this to two and that gives the right

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:50.820 
this to two and that gives the right
pulse<00:03:44.020> length<00:03:44.350> for<00:03:44.980> this<00:03:45.130> to<00:03:45.280> work<00:03:45.310> so<00:03:45.840> I<00:03:49.830> night

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:50.830 
pulse length for this to work so I night

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:54.750 
pulse length for this to work so I night
wait<00:03:51.610> what's<00:03:52.180> gone<00:03:52.450> wrong<00:03:52.480> I<00:03:53.640> laughter<00:03:54.640> you

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:54.760 
wait what's gone wrong I laughter you

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:57.570 
wait what's gone wrong I laughter you
need<00:03:54.940> an<00:03:55.060> inverter<00:03:55.480> that's<00:03:55.870> right<00:03:56.430> yep<00:03:57.430> you

00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:57.580 
need an inverter that's right yep you

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:00.510 
need an inverter that's right yep you
need<00:03:57.730> inverted<00:03:58.420> so<00:03:58.600> the<00:03:58.720> pulse<00:03:59.020> is<00:03:59.770> like<00:04:00.160> when

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:00.520 
need inverted so the pulse is like when

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:05.130 
need inverted so the pulse is like when
they<00:04:00.670> come<00:04:00.970> in<00:04:01.150> that's<00:04:01.750> right<00:04:03.840> now<00:04:04.840> it<00:04:04.900> should

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:05.140 
they come in that's right now it should

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:10.320 
they come in that's right now it should
work<00:04:06.300> yep<00:04:07.300> see<00:04:08.170> that<00:04:08.350> works

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:10.330 
work yep see that works

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:13.089 
work yep see that works
so<00:04:11.330> that<00:04:11.510> is<00:04:11.660> basically<00:04:11.690> how<00:04:12.290> you<00:04:12.500> build<00:04:12.890> it

00:04:13.089 --> 00:04:13.099 
so that is basically how you build it

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:15.370 
so that is basically how you build it
and<00:04:13.220> to<00:04:14.030> set<00:04:14.239> this<00:04:14.390> far<00:04:14.630> up<00:04:14.660> you<00:04:14.959> just<00:04:15.080> do<00:04:15.349> a

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:15.380 
and to set this far up you just do a

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:18.789 
and to set this far up you just do a
simple<00:04:15.620> clock<00:04:16.269> so<00:04:17.269> you'd<00:04:17.480> have<00:04:17.510> that<00:04:18.500> there

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:18.799 
simple clock so you'd have that there

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:22.540 
simple clock so you'd have that there
this<00:04:19.760> here<00:04:20.150> a<00:04:20.950> repeat<00:04:21.950> you're<00:04:22.100> coming<00:04:22.400> off<00:04:22.520> of

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:22.550 
this here a repeat you're coming off of

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:26.200 
this here a repeat you're coming off of
it<00:04:23.470> back<00:04:24.470> coming<00:04:24.770> around<00:04:25.010> here<00:04:25.430> and<00:04:25.760> this<00:04:26.030> can

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:26.210 
it back coming around here and this can

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:28.870 
it back coming around here and this can
be<00:04:26.360> output<00:04:26.900> here<00:04:27.110> say<00:04:27.620> it<00:04:27.680> two<00:04:27.860> three<00:04:28.100> so<00:04:28.790> it

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:28.880 
be output here say it two three so it

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:32.440 
be output here say it two three so it
doesn't<00:04:29.120> burn<00:04:29.270> out<00:04:29.540> like<00:04:29.810> it<00:04:29.960> just<00:04:30.169> did<00:04:31.450> and

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:32.450 
doesn't burn out like it just did and

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:38.650 
doesn't burn out like it just did and
then<00:04:33.410> this<00:04:33.560> would<00:04:33.770> come<00:04:34.100> into<00:04:34.460> your<00:04:37.360> into<00:04:38.360> here

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:38.660 
then this would come into your into here

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:42.909 
then this would come into your into here
basically<00:04:39.200> along<00:04:40.010> a<00:04:40.310> wall<00:04:41.120> like<00:04:41.740> the<00:04:42.740> wire

00:04:42.909 --> 00:04:42.919 
basically along a wall like the wire

00:04:42.919 --> 00:04:45.400 
basically along a wall like the wire
would<00:04:43.100> come<00:04:43.280> along<00:04:43.400> here<00:04:43.760> so<00:04:44.410> that's

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:45.410 
would come along here so that's

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:48.000 
would come along here so that's
basically<00:04:45.560> how<00:04:45.860> to<00:04:46.130> get<00:04:46.370> infinite<00:04:47.000> rails<00:04:47.270> in

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:48.010 
basically how to get infinite rails in

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:51.430 
basically how to get infinite rails in
minecraft<00:04:49.010> 1.1<00:04:49.639> i<00:04:50.120> don't<00:04:50.930> know<00:04:51.020> when<00:04:51.139> this<00:04:51.229> we
