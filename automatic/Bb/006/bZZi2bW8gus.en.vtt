00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:05.160
 how about movie friends that mercy 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:08.370
 welcome to a Saturday of wars that 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:10.259
 it's a lot a lot a lot but a lot of time 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:13.049
 that is not it would be a Saturday of wars 

00:00:10.259 --> 00:00:15.089
 and this is good as you see in the 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:18.090
 description of the video we are doing 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:20.009
 we keep trying to do this with we go 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.420
 I do not know why I put it like this 

00:00:20.009 --> 00:00:23.880
 some say tell cope uy 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:26.910
 because he still uses freckles but the perch 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.980
 is not so strong in action on the basis of 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.740
 this attack if it's not the golems are the 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.900
 wizards towards sin could also 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.630
 remove takes magicians themes or take one 

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:39.330
 after another because you would not feel that 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:43.410
 be so strong the pk why is that 

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:45.510
 do not mention it here and well then 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:48.090
 war is more or less even and come 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:50.010
 as it is good for an extra attack that 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.390
 they have been doing them and we are 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.730
 still we are won by two stars 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.800
 is a Spanish clan of this alive yes 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.450
 We won and we would go pretty well because 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.610
 company I would be taking something but 

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:02.160
 that's not important we're going to attacks 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:03.640
 so let's move on to the clouds here 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:07.220
 a small edition 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:09.800
 and after removing the clouds this good 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:11.450
 This was number one and it was my turn 

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:14.390
 number two this is also the one that 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:16.520
 I just wanted to start with this one because 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:18.350
 well I think I made some mistakes 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:21.650
 Sometimes I wanted to share with 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:24.860
 you this quickly did not take the 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:26.979
 50% because because if I'm going to attack her 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:29.810
 up and maybe it was not the best option 

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:33.350
 possibly the best option would have 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:35.360
 been attacked from here below and good with 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:37.550
 the magicians everything else this while 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:39.650
 cultural then in all the damage of was 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:41.659
 very possible that city I made the 50 

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:43.100
 percent but also as per the 

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:44.930
 top part even if it's like more 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:46.280
 easy to get to the town hall and want 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:48.890
 be good even if it's a star 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:50.440
 I decided to make the attack for the part of 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:52.940
 up here how are you guys watching 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:54.649
 then good we launch the golems 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:57.229
 then we launched to that the position of 

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:58.670
 jump so they pass as fast 

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:00.380
 possible 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:01.570
 this part remember that here good what 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:03.530
 we break are not that important 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:05.090
 fortunately and how can you see good 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:08.030
 the magicians can without any problem 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:10.009
 so clean the area since all 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:11.510
 all this is attacking the golems 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:14.440
 we reach the following position of 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:16.480
 jump that if they realize it comes 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:18.730
 to reach the center sometimes going up 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:21.790
 the town hall and let's go here is 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:23.770
 both the lightning and the anger position 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:24.640
 so that in one way or another they are 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:27.190
 zeros 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:28.870
 good and to be the theory magicians remain 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:31.120
 whatever they can say the 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:33.250
 town hall and we already got there in 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:35.560
 it was good then this one can not be achieved 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:38.470
 much more from that position the 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:40.030
 truth is that there is almost nothing now very 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:42.190
 little of what can be achieved to 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:43.720
 attack 15 this may have come out 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:47.380
 better if I had done it from another side 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:48.610
 if the truth is that it was not the best other 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:50.740
 the same thing if they realize it is how 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:53.080
 be carrying six goals because a 7 

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:55.540
 kilo of valence whether they are 5 or 6 being 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:58.900
 that are more important we are going to check 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:01.540
 the attack that I made to my mirror 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:02.730
 which is the most important that I think that 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:04.710
 is going to be more than one you will like 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:07.930
 then we go to the ships 

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:11.260
 we are going to remove the nine chairs and 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:12.940
 other let's put a small stop and 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:15.700
 again five goals is coming 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:18.400
 another golem home with six goals 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:19.720
 is it already you can see it 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:21.640
 well compartmentalized is being 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:23.709
 contains many parts this has many 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:25.959
 compartments on the other hand as it is already 

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:28.629
 a village that has even many walls 

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:32.080
 level 11 practically everyone has 

00:03:28.629 --> 00:03:35.019
 to the minimum 10 I live practically because 

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:36.670
 he still has about 80 or if not me 

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:39.069
 I'm not saying I'm not going to tell them but 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:41.410
 has 80 as 9 staff where the 

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:44.830
 modes can be a big problem and I think 

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:47.290
 I really liked this attack because 

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:51.310
 good has towers sick to the fullest and 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:53.739
 has good heroes and has subtraction the 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:55.720
 level 20 higher the queen the 21 to 0 if 

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:57.880
 it's a village that if you say u and it's not like 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:59.260
 he attacked not even good already has a 

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:01.870
 of the air defenses already has it 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:05.079
 also to the top and well what I 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:07.269
 I did watching it well and that was it 

00:04:05.079 --> 00:04:09.670
 gamble in the center that will see 

00:04:07.269 --> 00:04:12.220
 then in this part of here we go 

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:14.560
 to give him play and the first thing they're going to 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:16.780
 to do is again released the golems 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:18.280
 there are the first ones here that what 

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:21.739
 what I loved was this position of 

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:23.690
 you see that jump was very lucky 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:25.789
 but I think it's lucky not what 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:28.610
 boast of something else because because if 

00:04:25.789 --> 00:04:31.490
 they realize we are both covering the 

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:33.710
 part of the canyon and this tower see that 

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:36.349
 we are covering the part where the 

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:39.740
 defense and to the fullest we are covering the 

00:04:36.349 --> 00:04:42.139
 part where is also that of the 

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:45.080
 Two wizard towers plus the mortar but 

00:04:42.139 --> 00:04:46.970
 interestingly, even for the same 

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:51.069
 Sometimes this tiny space species 

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:54.110
 that we are covering what would be the 

00:04:51.069 --> 00:04:55.970
 crossbow then we are covering all 

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:58.490
 this section with only one position of 

00:04:55.970 --> 00:05:01.370
 jump which in the end will make us the 

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:04.400
 I completely stop there that heavy position 

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:06.830
 it was very well thrown the truth this I had 

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:09.770
 good luck in throwing it in place 

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:11.389
 just because a little fake move 

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:13.789
 and something has come out completely 

00:05:11.389 --> 00:05:16.370
 different we also throw there are here and 

00:05:13.789 --> 00:05:18.919
 the bullet is seeing the position of 

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:20.599
 rage here I honestly yes I was 

00:05:18.919 --> 00:05:24.979
 as concentrated seeing other things and not 

00:05:20.599 --> 00:05:26.389
 I looked very well at the castle to get it out 

00:05:24.979 --> 00:05:28.370
 but at least that gives me time to 

00:05:26.389 --> 00:05:30.350
 come out this skeleton trap and 

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:32.000
 so when I cast her she killed so much 

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:35.930
 to the skeletons and that the king is not 

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:38.000
 as distracted as what was left of the 

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:41.150
 castle we already destroyed the town hall to 

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:43.669
 a 30 21 percent the question is 

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:46.100
 I will make 50 percent we will 

00:05:43.669 --> 00:05:47.300
 go a little faster to an ip houses 

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:49.520
 you will remove the equipment at its best 

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:54.169
 effort although it is also 

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:54.919
 eating very fast and 46 percent almost 

00:05:54.169 --> 00:05:57.020
 we do it 

00:05:54.919 --> 00:05:58.310
 there is 50 percent after that 

00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:00.620
 if we need to, I was not going to be able to 

00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:02.389
 do the great thing but good we 

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:04.310
 We have two stars for a village 

00:06:02.389 --> 00:06:06.979
 that it had very heavy walls without 

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:09.800
 take us one breaks walls then 

00:06:06.979 --> 00:06:12.800
 I think that's the interesting thing about this 

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:16.430
 army to change the music to wear 

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:17.780
 ice positions and well here is the 

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:20.930
 attack that I hope you're liking 

00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:23.150
 I would like to know if you are interested 

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:25.520
 do it if they think it's worth it 

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:27.510
 try it if they tell me peter and I am 

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:29.550
 Town hall level 

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:32.340
 8 this as you would for a 

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:35.070
 city ​​hall level 8 and I say obviously 

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:37.950
 it asks 10 people night because 

00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:40.050
 I'm not going to 1.0 try doing this same 

00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:42.270
 attack whether in war or even what 

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:43.680
 I can do personally I do not say no no 

00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:46.170
 it is necessarily that I have to do it 

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:47.820
 at war but there we can make several 

00:06:46.170 --> 00:06:49.470
 things do not have to change a bit 

00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:51.110
 because we do not have jumping position but 

00:06:49.470 --> 00:06:53.400
 we could make some modifications 

00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:55.620
 I still hope you liked it 

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:57.600
 these two attacks that I shared with you I know 

00:06:55.620 --> 00:06:59.910
 that the first street pretty but 

00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:01.620
 Good thing now we have to learn from the 

00:06:59.910 --> 00:07:03.120
 errors and if you see attacked in the first 

00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:05.940
 on the bottom part I would have left 

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:07.890
 much better the second good thing 

00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:09.720
 two stars this I think it was 

00:07:07.890 --> 00:07:12.240
 great for a village with so cute monkeys 

00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:14.340
 bastards the truth is that I do not even 

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:16.950
 I hoped I thought that angel was going to 

00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:19.110
 take one out and I keep trying this 

00:07:16.950 --> 00:07:20.490
 army of truth in short I was his 

00:07:19.110 --> 00:07:23.630
 friend peter that I'm fine and up 

00:07:20.490 --> 00:07:23.630
 the next video bye bye
