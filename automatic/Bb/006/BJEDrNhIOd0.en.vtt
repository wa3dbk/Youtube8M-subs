00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:01.620 
hey there's Matt Munson for the project

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:03.169 
hey there's Matt Munson for the project
workbench<00:00:02.220> and<00:00:02.370> today<00:00:02.700> what<00:00:02.909> we're<00:00:03.000> going<00:00:03.030> to

00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:03.179 
workbench and today what we're going to

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:05.960 
workbench and today what we're going to
do<00:00:03.360> is<00:00:03.600> pull<00:00:04.049> off<00:00:04.380> the<00:00:04.620> mold<00:00:04.859> our<00:00:05.130> first<00:00:05.640> test

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:05.970 
do is pull off the mold our first test

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:09.020 
do is pull off the mold our first test
of<00:00:06.210> urethane<00:00:06.600> scale<00:00:07.589> skin<00:00:08.309> what<00:00:08.849> we've<00:00:09.000> got

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:09.030 
of urethane scale skin what we've got

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:11.749 
of urethane scale skin what we've got
here<00:00:09.210> is<00:00:09.480> on<00:00:09.929> the<00:00:10.290> bottom<00:00:10.500> is<00:00:10.860> the<00:00:11.160> silicone

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:11.759 
here is on the bottom is the silicone

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:14.780 
here is on the bottom is the silicone
mold<00:00:12.059> on<00:00:12.360> top<00:00:13.080> of<00:00:13.290> that<00:00:13.469> is<00:00:13.710> a<00:00:13.740> layer<00:00:14.099> of<00:00:14.130> bright

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
mold on top of that is a layer of bright

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.000 
mold on top of that is a layer of bright
red<00:00:15.089> urethane<00:00:15.660> which<00:00:15.870> was<00:00:16.049> just<00:00:16.260> a<00:00:16.410> test<00:00:16.650> color

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
red urethane which was just a test color

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.120 
red urethane which was just a test color
I<00:00:17.310> want<00:00:17.820> to<00:00:17.880> try<00:00:18.029> and<00:00:18.270> then<00:00:18.570> on<00:00:18.660> top<00:00:18.900> of<00:00:18.960> that<00:00:19.170> we

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
I want to try and then on top of that we

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.370 
I want to try and then on top of that we
have<00:00:20.160> a<00:00:20.520> layer<00:00:20.760> of<00:00:20.970> black<00:00:21.510> millis<00:00:22.109> skin

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
have a layer of black millis skin

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.590 
have a layer of black millis skin
pressed<00:00:23.010> into<00:00:23.400> it<00:00:23.699> so<00:00:23.850> the<00:00:23.970> idea<00:00:24.090> is<00:00:24.300> that<00:00:24.390> I'll

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
pressed into it so the idea is that I'll

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.810 
pressed into it so the idea is that I'll
add<00:00:24.750> some<00:00:24.779> some<00:00:25.590> rigidity<00:00:26.010> to<00:00:26.369> it<00:00:26.519> so<00:00:26.699> it<00:00:26.789> can

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
add some some rigidity to it so it can

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.400 
add some some rigidity to it so it can
stretch<00:00:27.180> and<00:00:27.510> pull<00:00:27.869> it<00:00:28.019> together<00:00:28.140> without

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
stretch and pull it together without

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.160 
stretch and pull it together without
tearing<00:00:28.800> or<00:00:29.310> at<00:00:29.400> least<00:00:29.519> will<00:00:29.640> be<00:00:29.730> stronger<00:00:30.240> ok

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
tearing or at least will be stronger ok

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.910 
tearing or at least will be stronger ok
so<00:00:31.230> let's<00:00:31.679> uh<00:00:31.890> let's<00:00:32.189> give<00:00:32.730> it<00:00:32.759> a<00:00:32.820> try<00:00:32.940> come<00:00:33.180> on

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:33.920 
so let's uh let's give it a try come on

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:39.350 
so let's uh let's give it a try come on
ok<00:00:34.920> it<00:00:35.040> looks<00:00:35.100> like<00:00:35.460> it's<00:00:35.640> all<00:00:36.410> cured<00:00:38.149> so<00:00:39.149> let's

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
ok it looks like it's all cured so let's

00:00:39.360 --> 00:01:00.650 
ok it looks like it's all cured so let's
see<00:00:39.629> what<00:00:39.930> happens

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.340 

actually<00:01:01.660> made<00:01:01.780> a<00:01:01.809> pretty<00:01:02.050> interesting

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:02.350 
actually made a pretty interesting

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:06.690 
actually made a pretty interesting
texture<00:01:03.040> so<00:01:03.880> come<00:01:04.059> in<00:01:04.150> closer<00:01:05.460> so<00:01:06.460> you<00:01:06.490> can<00:01:06.580> see

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:06.700 
texture so come in closer so you can see

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:08.730 
texture so come in closer so you can see
what<00:01:06.970> happened<00:01:07.450> and<00:01:07.540> here<00:01:07.900> is<00:01:08.050> what<00:01:08.320> it<00:01:08.410> is<00:01:08.530> we

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:08.740 
what happened and here is what it is we

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:11.460 
what happened and here is what it is we
brushed<00:01:09.040> in<00:01:09.280> the<00:01:09.670> urethane<00:01:10.000> and<00:01:10.450> then<00:01:10.990> put<00:01:11.320> the

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:11.470 
brushed in the urethane and then put the

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:13.590 
brushed in the urethane and then put the
middle<00:01:11.800> of<00:01:11.830> skin<00:01:12.040> on<00:01:12.100> top<00:01:12.160> and<00:01:12.580> unrolled<00:01:13.150> it<00:01:13.420> on

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:13.600 
middle of skin on top and unrolled it on

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.540 
middle of skin on top and unrolled it on
top<00:01:13.869> of<00:01:13.930> it<00:01:14.080> to<00:01:14.200> press<00:01:14.410> it<00:01:14.560> in<00:01:14.680> I<00:01:14.860> think<00:01:15.400> what

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:15.550 
top of it to press it in I think what

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:19.200 
top of it to press it in I think what
happened<00:01:15.880> is<00:01:15.910> we<00:01:16.060> I<00:01:16.270> pressed<00:01:16.750> it<00:01:16.900> into<00:01:16.990> hard<00:01:18.210> as

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:19.210 
happened is we I pressed it into hard as

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:21.240 
happened is we I pressed it into hard as
you<00:01:19.330> can<00:01:19.479> see<00:01:19.810> where<00:01:20.020> you<00:01:20.350> can<00:01:20.530> see<00:01:20.710> the<00:01:20.740> fabric

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:21.250 
you can see where you can see the fabric

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:23.370 
you can see where you can see the fabric
is<00:01:21.400> real<00:01:22.060> close<00:01:22.330> and<00:01:22.390> they're<00:01:22.690> just<00:01:22.869> real<00:01:23.050> thin

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:23.380 
is real close and they're just real thin

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:25.920 
is real close and they're just real thin
and<00:01:23.619> up<00:01:24.040> in<00:01:24.220> here<00:01:24.670> you<00:01:24.850> can<00:01:25.509> see<00:01:25.750> where<00:01:25.899> I

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:25.930 
and up in here you can see where I

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:28.410 
and up in here you can see where I
didn't<00:01:26.170> quite<00:01:26.380> get<00:01:26.619> enough<00:01:27.000> urethane<00:01:28.000> in<00:01:28.330> the

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:28.420 
didn't quite get enough urethane in the

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:31.139 
didn't quite get enough urethane in the
mold<00:01:28.630> and<00:01:29.250> another<00:01:30.250> thing<00:01:30.430> i<00:01:30.550> didn't<00:01:30.850> do<00:01:30.940> is<00:01:31.060> I

00:01:31.139 --> 00:01:31.149 
mold and another thing i didn't do is I

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:32.969 
mold and another thing i didn't do is I
didn't<00:01:31.390> iron<00:01:31.660> the<00:01:31.869> fabric<00:01:31.899> before<00:01:32.440> I<00:01:32.649> put<00:01:32.890> it

00:01:32.969 --> 00:01:32.979 
didn't iron the fabric before I put it

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:35.400 
didn't iron the fabric before I put it
in<00:01:33.070> you<00:01:33.670> can<00:01:33.820> see<00:01:33.940> this<00:01:34.060> wrinkles<00:01:34.690> and<00:01:34.899> those

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:35.410 
in you can see this wrinkles and those

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:39.389 
in you can see this wrinkles and those
show<00:01:35.770> up<00:01:35.979> on<00:01:36.550> the<00:01:37.119> material<00:01:37.600> like<00:01:37.780> this<00:01:38.399> so

00:01:39.389 --> 00:01:39.399 
show up on the material like this so

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:41.580 
show up on the material like this so
that's<00:01:39.670> not<00:01:39.910> ideal<00:01:40.180> but<00:01:40.720> I<00:01:40.780> think<00:01:41.050> as<00:01:41.200> a<00:01:41.229> as<00:01:41.500> a

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:41.590 
that's not ideal but I think as a as a

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:43.560 
that's not ideal but I think as a as a
first<00:01:42.039> test<00:01:42.340> I<00:01:42.700> think<00:01:42.910> this<00:01:43.030> turned<00:01:43.180> out<00:01:43.300> real

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:43.570 
first test I think this turned out real

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:47.460 
first test I think this turned out real
good<00:01:43.810> and<00:01:44.130> actually<00:01:45.130> now<00:01:45.880> that<00:01:45.910> I<00:01:46.149> see<00:01:46.479> it<00:01:46.600> this

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:47.470 
good and actually now that I see it this

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:49.200 
good and actually now that I see it this
also<00:01:47.710> makes<00:01:48.130> for<00:01:48.490> a<00:01:48.520> very<00:01:48.729> interesting

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:49.210 
also makes for a very interesting

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:53.730 
also makes for a very interesting
looking<00:01:50.550> texture<00:01:52.170> like<00:01:53.170> with<00:01:53.380> the<00:01:53.500> black

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:53.740 
looking texture like with the black

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:55.920 
looking texture like with the black
peeking<00:01:54.460> out<00:01:54.550> from<00:01:54.610> under<00:01:54.970> the<00:01:55.060> red<00:01:55.299> I<00:01:55.570> think

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:55.930 
peeking out from under the red I think

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:58.140 
peeking out from under the red I think
what<00:01:56.080> I<00:01:56.110> would<00:01:56.170> do<00:01:56.470> in<00:01:56.619> the<00:01:56.710> future<00:01:56.890> my<00:01:57.790> next

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:58.150 
what I would do in the future my next

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:01.590 
what I would do in the future my next
test<00:01:58.360> I'll<00:01:58.650> roll<00:01:59.650> in<00:01:59.920> a<00:02:00.040> layer<00:02:00.280> of<00:02:00.600> urethane

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:01.600 
test I'll roll in a layer of urethane

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:04.980 
test I'll roll in a layer of urethane
and<00:02:02.110> then<00:02:02.950> let<00:02:03.189> it<00:02:03.220> cure<00:02:03.670> and<00:02:04.150> then<00:02:04.659> roll<00:02:04.840> in

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:04.990 
and then let it cure and then roll in

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:06.719 
and then let it cure and then roll in
another<00:02:05.350> layer<00:02:05.710> and<00:02:05.979> put<00:02:06.159> the<00:02:06.250> fabric<00:02:06.400> on<00:02:06.700> top

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:06.729 
another layer and put the fabric on top

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:09.800 
another layer and put the fabric on top
of<00:02:07.030> it<00:02:07.090> that<00:02:07.270> way<00:02:07.450> I'll<00:02:07.659> get<00:02:07.990> a<00:02:08.049> rock<00:02:08.320> solid<00:02:08.679> red

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
of it that way I'll get a rock solid red

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.850 
of it that way I'll get a rock solid red
but<00:02:10.810> this<00:02:10.929> would<00:02:11.080> be<00:02:11.140> good<00:02:11.320> because<00:02:11.500> I<00:02:11.650> can

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:11.860 
but this would be good because I can

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:14.670 
but this would be good because I can
test<00:02:12.160> paint<00:02:13.000> and<00:02:13.660> see<00:02:14.019> how<00:02:14.110> it<00:02:14.230> sticks<00:02:14.440> to<00:02:14.590> that

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:14.680 
test paint and see how it sticks to that

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:19.710 
test paint and see how it sticks to that
ceiling<00:02:15.190> cover<00:02:15.370> some<00:02:15.610> that<00:02:15.730> step<00:02:15.970> up

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:24.050 

okay<00:02:20.350> but<00:02:20.410> you<00:02:20.530> can<00:02:20.740> see<00:02:20.950> it's<00:02:21.130> real<00:02:21.340> flexible

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:28.380 

balls<00:02:25.060> up<00:02:25.240> real<00:02:25.450> nicely<00:02:25.860> very<00:02:26.860> flexible<00:02:27.460> so

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:28.390 
balls up real nicely very flexible so

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:31.740 
balls up real nicely very flexible so
interesting<00:02:29.020> definitely<00:02:29.980> not<00:02:30.730> perfect<00:02:31.090> first

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
interesting definitely not perfect first

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:35.790 
interesting definitely not perfect first
time<00:02:31.990> out<00:02:32.580> but<00:02:33.580> a<00:02:33.610> very<00:02:33.880> interesting<00:02:34.770> set<00:02:35.770> of

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:35.800 
time out but a very interesting set of

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:37.770 
time out but a very interesting set of
lessons<00:02:36.070> learned<00:02:36.390> overall<00:02:37.390> and<00:02:37.540> really

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:37.780 
lessons learned overall and really

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:39.180 
lessons learned overall and really
pleased<00:02:38.020> with<00:02:38.050> the<00:02:38.290> results<00:02:38.620> obviously<00:02:39.070> this

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:39.190 
pleased with the results obviously this

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:41.730 
pleased with the results obviously this
is<00:02:39.400> not<00:02:39.430> a<00:02:39.610> final<00:02:40.210> product<00:02:40.510> I<00:02:40.930> would<00:02:41.350> not<00:02:41.470> use

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:41.740 
is not a final product I would not use

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:44.040 
is not a final product I would not use
this<00:02:42.010> to<00:02:42.220> make<00:02:42.340> something<00:02:42.700> but<00:02:43.450> uh<00:02:43.480> but

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:44.050 
this to make something but uh but

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:45.450 
this to make something but uh but
definitely<00:02:44.440> a<00:02:44.470> lot<00:02:44.590> of<00:02:44.770> lessons<00:02:44.920> learned<00:02:45.160> i

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:45.460 
definitely a lot of lessons learned i

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:46.770 
definitely a lot of lessons learned i
think<00:02:45.490> it<00:02:45.730> turned<00:02:45.910> out<00:02:45.940> real<00:02:46.180> great<00:02:46.300> for<00:02:46.570> first

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:46.780 
think it turned out real great for first

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:49.140 
think it turned out real great for first
effort
