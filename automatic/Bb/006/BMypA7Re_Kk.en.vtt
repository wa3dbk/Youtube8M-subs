 you are going to see special and then also 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:57.409
 let's use one of the best 

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:58.909
 butters of the world that is what I 

00:00:57.409 --> 00:01:01.009
 I use ur in my restaurant for 

00:00:58.909 --> 00:01:02.720
 they are easy to spread you know that also 

00:01:01.009 --> 00:01:05.030
 you have it with a little salt in this 

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:06.979
 case we are going to use it without salt and then 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:08.659
 we also have, as you already know, 

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:10.369
 good blueberries we know that the 

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:12.560
 product we always look for the best 

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:15.229
 product a quality cranberry 'good 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:18.110
 you can not use other fruits if 

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:19.590
 you want cherry plum first thing 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:23.700
 let's do is 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:25.770
 put the egg we will use 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:29.340
 a vanilla branch will cut towards the 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:31.890
 half what we do here now is with 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:34.259
 the help of the lace we take everything 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.289
 that is the essence of the ring with this is 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.289
 enough 

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:41.929
 here we have a little yeast we have 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:44.299
 the sugar with the flour we're going to 

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:49.219
 mix everything and now when the 

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:50.450
 beaten egg add we are going to fade 

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:54.340
 a little bit and we will add the 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:57.570
 butter and cheese a little later 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:02:01.400
 let's throw the cream so that 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.400
 go riding a bit with the yolk 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:10.030
 and the yeast the sugar and the flour 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:17.920
 but let's preheat the oven 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:18.850
 to cook it at 180 degrees for about 45 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.890
 minutes 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:23.110
 we are not going to add, we cover it well 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:25.980
 the bottom part even if it is filled three 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:27.930
 fourth parts then go up 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:29.640
 we are going to introduce it inside because if 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:31.680
 the cranberry does not release much juice 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:35.110
 so if we are interested in not seeing 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:39.690
 you almost know what we're going to put in the oven 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:44.250
 45 minutes but all in one pint 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:44.250
 extraordinary let's see how 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:48.489
 it's a little hot then there's 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:52.180
 I carefully cut theirs 

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:54.159
 is to let it sit for 20 minutes and 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:57.069
 could cut better good this is 

00:02:54.159 --> 00:02:59.290
