00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:25.529
 holistic personality

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:56.330
 when he wants to dissolve in it 

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:58.640

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:18.180
 These are the emotions that are exactly for this. 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.760
 need you to meet 

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:22.130
 and become together 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:24.109
 what happens next when 

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:26.880
 so and people some time together 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.390

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:37.770
 stay 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.340
 yes the fact that they lived not in time 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:43.080
 and then uman them and not notice that here 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:44.590
 Each of them 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:47.530
 it's still a man 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:50.440
 and if here I found my soul mate 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:53.440
 who then comes to me that 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:56.700
 i have me 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.250
 and he has him 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:01:59.830
 and they start moving in different 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:02.830
 parties 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.840

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:09.690
 here 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.780
 and here it all begins 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:14.220
 date conflicts with when 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:15.620
 when you dissolve 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:17.479
 man check 

00:02:17.479 --> 00:02:18.469
 when you dissolve 

00:02:18.469 --> 00:02:20.959
 man completely you do not notice that there 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:22.669
 they threw us away from us 

00:02:22.669 --> 00:02:25.499
 so I missed it in the red square 

00:02:25.499 --> 00:02:28.149
 yes and then all this all this is all forgiven 

00:02:28.149 --> 00:02:28.729
 this one 

00:02:28.729 --> 00:02:31.879
 a 3 st 

00:02:31.879 --> 00:02:34.510

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:45.230
 from another 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:47.190
 and now this movement in different directions but 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:48.789
 it can be painful 

00:02:48.789 --> 00:02:51.059
 that is, personally rolling up the conflict there 

00:02:51.059 --> 00:02:52.069
 and so on 

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:55.069
 here if there is no deterrent force 

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:58.399

 I know men who don't go 

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:44.089
 farther 

00:03:44.089 --> 00:03:45.829

 communication so on 

00:03:49.079 --> 00:03:50.799
 and then go no further 

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:53.529

00:03:58.329 --> 00:04:01.329
 what can be common 

00:04:06.199 --> 00:04:09.199
 sh 

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:13.349
 interests may be 

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:15.870
 there are interests 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:18.120
 that is, you are cool together yes you have 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:19.560
 what to do and so on 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:20.739
 may be 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:23.739
 may be what that matter 

00:04:25.629 --> 00:04:28.039
 watch TV together 

00:04:28.039 --> 00:04:29.759
 what else there without knowing it is possible there 

00:04:29.759 --> 00:04:32.990
 do business 

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:35.440
 this is something you have been to here 

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:36.059
 year 

00:04:36.059 --> 00:04:38.209
 you've been together been dissolved 

00:04:38.209 --> 00:04:40.159
 each other and you are there powder group 

00:04:40.159 --> 00:04:42.799
 trust very cool trust and on this 

00:04:42.799 --> 00:04:44.930
 things are done very well fed up 

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:46.930
 you learn 

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:49.930
 this is what else can be 

00:04:52.919 --> 00:04:55.919
 corn trash with 

00:04:58.809 --> 00:05:01.809
 more more more not worth it 

00:05:02.819 --> 00:05:05.009
 quite right 

00:05:05.009 --> 00:05:08.009
 can it so still hold revenge 

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:12.520
 children 

00:05:13.559 --> 00:05:15.399
 very real interests too 

00:05:15.399 --> 00:05:18.169
 begin to cross 

00:05:18.169 --> 00:05:21.169
 what else do you need to stick together 

00:05:21.169 --> 00:05:25.939
 kada yes debts there and so on 

00:05:28.669 --> 00:05:31.669
 what else 

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:34.520
 she is 

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:37.520
 can hold restrictions 

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:46.680
 someone there said social hate 

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:49.979
 no one for sex 

00:05:49.979 --> 00:05:51.610
 quite a limitation 

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:53.550
 I 

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:55.320
 we have common losses there 

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:57.080
 here are your limitations 

00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:00.020
 some other restrictions 

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:02.309
 also quite 

00:06:02.309 --> 00:06:05.339
 that the volume dad will kill you how heavy 

00:06:05.339 --> 00:06:07.309
 those relationships 

00:06:07.309 --> 00:06:10.309
 so that's just 

00:06:12.789 --> 00:06:16.029
 if you grow together 

00:06:16.029 --> 00:06:19.029
 if you invest each other's demand 

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:21.869
 then this relationship 

00:06:21.869 --> 00:06:23.110
 holding on 

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:24.479
 and develop 

00:06:24.479 --> 00:06:27.740
 if every man for himself 

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:30.590
 I have my own way for my own 

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:32.300
 something important 

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:34.349
 or in relation to hold on the site 

00:06:34.349 --> 00:06:36.039
 and then it appears that it is interpreted 

00:06:36.039 --> 00:06:37.710
 it is better 

00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:39.469
 then it all collapses 

00:06:39.469 --> 00:06:42.909
 so here you are when setting your mission 

00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:47.590
 and the development of another person and another 

00:06:47.590 --> 00:06:49.729
 man puts his mission this 

00:06:49.729 --> 00:06:50.999
 respect yourself 

00:06:50.999 --> 00:06:52.909
 and you do something for each other 

00:06:52.909 --> 00:06:54.860
 then it goes on then 

00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:56.919
 these relationships grow develop along with 

00:06:56.919 --> 00:06:58.589
 growth your development 

00:06:58.589 --> 00:07:00.399
 very many relationships are crumbling 

00:07:00.399 --> 00:07:01.550
 because 

00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:05.250
 1 grows and develops the author of beer operas on 

00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:07.809
 shop does not want to do 

00:07:07.809 --> 00:07:09.219
 most offensive 

00:07:09.219 --> 00:07:12.529
 the coolest is when you're cool 

00:07:12.529 --> 00:07:14.770
 next to this person 

00:07:14.770 --> 00:07:17.379
 and the further the more cool 

00:07:17.379 --> 00:07:19.830
 this is what works 

00:07:19.830 --> 00:07:22.830
 I suggest a break 

00:07:27.129 --> 00:07:27.639
 mayor
