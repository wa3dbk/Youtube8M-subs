 two-time world champion from elsendorp 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.640

 the grumpy van valcke six times in a row 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.930
 hard to win 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.210
 five years to win now go hope 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.400
 I nice for the sixth time will be difficult 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.720
 property competitions strong but we go 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.180
 do our best and 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.700
 pay attention again miss how stand up 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:38.040
 you yourself physically not yet 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.590
 as 100% should be but I am pain free and 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:43.110
 also had a certainly bad winter 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:45.270
 we are now constructive and 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:47.520
 way their best but I don't see that far 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.979
 from hellings can still with some after effects 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.350
 of an upper leg injury that a previous one 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:54.149
 year's championship cost anyway 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.470
 it just whether the competition 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:58.350
 can benefit 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:59.940
 paul rake is in a class by a 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:02.430
 man who takes the people to the circuit 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:05.700
 come and stand in line he is 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:08.369
 simply the best example 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:10.830
 ja ron preview watching matches from 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.690
 world and he comes to Netherlands 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:14.820
 my driver is young and he is still whole 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:16.980
 come far and child career 

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:18.299
 even from 5 that puts a performance here 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.950
 throw down sign put I stand 

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:21.600
 here on a wind that night 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:22.830
 I would have been a nerve by region 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:24.930
 to hand against so I can no longer 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:26.940
 drive and he gets in again 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:28.620
 yes always a fan of your own audience 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:30.030
 has been able to drive in you notice 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:32.580
 just when the Dutch village comes I can 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:35.130
 pull a little extra support and yes that is 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:36.269
 really for the super and the stained 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:38.370
 champion 

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:40.080
 to the rookie brian bogers 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:43.590
 Eindhoven is driving for the first time this year 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:46.380
 a whole ramkisoen in the mx2 class 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:47.670
 it goes better and better every match 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:50.430
 in the beginning of course true tension 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:52.320
 full year in the grip in the gp 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:54.540
 are actually the cover level what is there 

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:54.959
 I have a good result a few times 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:57.209
 driven 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:59.069
 and it was also my goal to say so 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:02.310
 to put in tenth place and 

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:05.310
 nice until now and again though and now 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:07.650
 I hope for a final ranking 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:09.629
 in the top 10 for sale and then 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:12.719

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:18.599
 first round of the grand prix of 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:21.060
 valkenswaard 

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:23.189
 and they are gone with a super start 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:25.919
 for the rest tons of cabbage from the Brabant 

00:03:23.189 --> 00:03:27.930
 wilvo nest husqvarna team but 

00:03:25.919 --> 00:03:31.500
 Jeffrey de Bullet's seat is on him 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:34.849
 wheels and here herlings are already there again 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:34.849
 along and gone is it 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:42.970
 not everyone got away well the brit

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:48.670
 pond flown and also the LED 

00:03:45.159 --> 00:03:50.950
 joris has a whole lot of heart 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:55.379
 brian boris here is a fight with the 

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:55.379
 Fransman's change is in fifth place 

00:03:58.629 --> 00:04:03.310
 in the meantime herlings is just walking 

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:06.239
 more and is not a measure of the 

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:06.239
 crucell from elsendorp 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:10.269
 he wins with two fingers in the nose 

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:12.280
 first moto 

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:14.440
 boog glass finally comes in sixth 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:16.060
 across the finish line to Wednesday was already 

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:17.889
 processed immediately from test round at the 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:20.169
 management and since then just normal 

00:04:17.889 --> 00:04:21.190
 done my thing and a small 40 

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:23.110
 seconds won 

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:24.940
 super well done so well two smart 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:26.320
 home care if you see you driving like that 

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:29.470
 You don't think you have a hundred 

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:30.550
 percent and yet it is not just yet 

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:32.650
 we are working hard to get back 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:34.900
 often had minor injuries 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:36.669
 but now follow me on percent maya 

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:38.260
 the train is a new under percent 

00:04:36.669 --> 00:04:40.060
 I was hoping to make his asbestos model 

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:41.740
 and for a good second second moto more 

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:44.289
 good stuff i best result so far 

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:45.280
 I actually have my own each 

00:04:44.289 --> 00:04:49.889
 match improved 

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:52.990
 because of yes was a little center to 

00:04:49.889 --> 00:04:54.490
 lm80 after 6 so z more and more 

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:57.099
 improvements 

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:59.440
 in mx1 world champion thyme oil had one 

00:04:57.099 --> 00:05:01.240
 tough day after crash in the first 

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:05.169
 moto he came to his own alleged 

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:07.120
 park his motorcycle in the pit lane 

00:05:05.169 --> 00:05:07.599
 glencore still hot has a piece 

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:09.340
 better 

00:05:07.599 --> 00:05:10.840
 he drove back to the French 

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:13.960
 poles to a handsome 

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:15.789
 seventh place in the royal class 

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:17.949
 he can do that in the second month 

00:05:15.789 --> 00:05:20.289
 you don't repeat coldenhoff being there 

00:05:17.949 --> 00:05:22.960
 in tenths and may with a 9th place 

00:05:20.289 --> 00:05:24.880
 totally satisfied back home the 

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:28.050
 Frenchman Poland was also in the second 

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:28.050
 manche the strongest 

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:40.990
 faq 

00:05:52.689 --> 00:05:55.349
 Yes 

00:05:58.149 --> 00:06:03.889
 the second moto then in the mx2 

00:06:02.029 --> 00:06:09.949
 herlings still sleeps a bit like it 

00:06:03.889 --> 00:06:11.990
 fence falls down and is badly gone then in 

00:06:09.949 --> 00:06:14.599
 his hunt for leadership another mistake 

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:19.059
 in a bad slope stretched into it 

00:06:14.599 --> 00:06:19.059
 sand is still exciting 

00:06:22.459 --> 00:06:26.959
 brian bogers drives his study into 

00:06:24.319 --> 00:06:28.279
 debut year and chance I want to measure with the 

00:06:26.959 --> 00:06:30.499
 fastest riders 

00:06:28.279 --> 00:06:34.129
 he is among the top five but gets here 

00:06:30.499 --> 00:06:38.059
 caught up by herlings 

00:06:34.129 --> 00:06:40.369
 there is again no measure on them 

00:06:38.059 --> 00:06:43.219
 despite two mistakes, he drives it again 

00:06:40.369 --> 00:06:45.289
 whole field to pieces 

00:06:43.219 --> 00:06:48.229
 for the sixth year in a row, jeffrey 

00:06:45.289 --> 00:06:49.789
 herlings the grand prix of valkenswaard 

00:06:48.229 --> 00:06:51.919
 yes it was a lake anyway 

00:06:49.789 --> 00:06:54.319
 satisfaction as the first bit 

00:06:51.919 --> 00:06:56.599
 bad way my start and yes I had 

00:06:54.319 --> 00:06:58.699
 look a little between the 

00:06:56.599 --> 00:07:00.680
 toppers and and long until I fought hard 

00:06:58.699 --> 00:07:02.839
 for the spots and first my dear 

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:04.490
 so do comfort on your own thing 

00:07:02.839 --> 00:07:06.649
 small mistake school away for this but 

00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:08.659
 that their back yet again and 

00:07:06.649 --> 00:07:09.680
 battled and ultimately dimanche 

00:07:08.659 --> 00:07:11.629
 so win 

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:14.240
 full 50 points and like me in a row 

00:07:11.629 --> 00:07:16.909
 won slope again on one 

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:20.659
 brian bogers fell just outside the podium 

00:07:16.909 --> 00:07:23.269
 but was pretty fourth in two months 

00:07:20.659 --> 00:07:25.249
 no I certainly did not expect I am going 

00:07:23.269 --> 00:07:27.159
 I did finish when I was in the top ten 

00:07:25.249 --> 00:07:29.539
 by top 5 solea that's just 

00:07:27.159 --> 00:07:33.709
 naturally great it is my first 

00:07:29.539 --> 00:07:36.349
 years complete andries and yes just super 

00:07:33.709 --> 00:07:39.309
 six years in a row unbeatable here six 

00:07:36.349 --> 00:07:42.319
 Wilhelmus has been riding it ever for years 

00:07:39.309 --> 00:07:44.179
 difficult question but yes super score 

00:07:42.319 --> 00:07:45.979
 Pub for the eighth time P victory 

00:07:44.179 --> 00:07:48.619

00:07:45.979 --> 00:07:50.449
 career now so yes we continue to stay ahead 

00:07:48.619 --> 00:07:52.279
 fight and hopefully again next year 

00:07:50.449 --> 00:07:54.229
 jeffrey leaves with a red place 

00:07:52.279 --> 00:07:55.249
 herlings to spain for the next 

00:07:54.229 --> 00:07:56.899
 grumpy 

00:07:55.249 --> 00:07:59.089
