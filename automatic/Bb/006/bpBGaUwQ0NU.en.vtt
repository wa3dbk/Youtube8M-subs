year<00:01:06.560> so<00:01:07.490> as<00:01:07.640> a<00:01:07.670> result<00:01:07.850> we<00:01:08.180> end<00:01:08.300> up<00:01:08.420> with<00:01:08.570> a<00:01:08.600> lot

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:08.810 
year so as a result we end up with a lot

year so as a result we end up with a lot
of<00:01:08.840> ramps<00:01:09.200> left<00:01:09.410> over<00:01:09.740> and<00:01:09.890> that's<00:01:10.070> why<00:01:10.250> it<00:01:10.310> was

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:10.430 
of ramps left over and that's why it was

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:12.400 
of ramps left over and that's why it was
a<00:01:10.460> good<00:01:10.610> idea<00:01:10.940> to<00:01:11.060> get<00:01:11.479> the<00:01:11.630> ramps<00:01:11.810> to<00:01:11.960> the<00:01:12.170> city

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:12.410

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:21.980 
the city has decided that perhaps they

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:23.470 
the city has decided that perhaps they
should<00:01:22.010> invest<00:01:22.400> our<00:01:22.520> own<00:01:22.670> money<00:01:22.940> rather<00:01:23.390> than

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:23.480 
should invest our own money rather than

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:25.360 
should invest our own money rather than
just<00:01:23.720> relying<00:01:23.870> on<00:01:24.290> an<00:01:24.470> individual<00:01:25.100> or<00:01:25.220> an

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:25.370 
just relying on an individual or an

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:27.580
