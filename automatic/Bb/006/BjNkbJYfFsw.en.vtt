metal iron

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:15.330 
metal iron
and<00:02:12.190> then<00:02:12.640> you'll<00:02:12.820> also<00:02:13.030> get<00:02:13.480> wood<00:02:14.410> I<00:02:14.650> guess

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:15.340 
and then you'll also get wood I guess

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:17.640 
and then you'll also get wood I guess
it's<00:02:15.490> called<00:02:15.640> sanded<00:02:16.230> listen<00:02:17.230> it<00:02:17.320> would<00:02:17.440> but

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.650 
it's called sanded listen it would but

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:19.410 
it's called sanded listen it would but
you'll<00:02:18.160> see<00:02:18.340> when<00:02:18.520> I<00:02:18.550> break<00:02:18.760> him<00:02:18.910> down<00:02:18.940> but<00:02:19.300> you

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420 
you'll see when I break him down but you

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:20.790 
you'll see when I break him down but you
just<00:02:19.570> want<00:02:19.750> to<00:02:19.810> steal<00:02:19.990> everything<00:02:20.290> and<00:02:20.710> this

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:20.800 
just want to steal everything and this

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:22.590 
just want to steal everything and this
is<00:02:20.980> similar<00:02:21.160> to<00:02:21.280> a<00:02:21.370> video<00:02:21.640> I've<00:02:21.760> done<00:02:21.790> in<00:02:22.540> the

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:22.600 
is similar to a video I've done in the

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:24.450 
is similar to a video I've done in the
past<00:02:22.660> but<00:02:23.110> when<00:02:23.590> I<00:02:23.620> first<00:02:23.860> did<00:02:24.130> this<00:02:24.280> video

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:24.460 
past but when I first did this video

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:26.490 
past but when I first did this video
about<00:02:25.000> how<00:02:25.210> to<00:02:25.240> steal<00:02:25.600> and<00:02:25.960> make<00:02:26.350> money

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500 
about how to steal and make money

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:28.740 
about how to steal and make money
infinitely<00:02:26.980> it<00:02:27.730> was<00:02:27.850> it<00:02:28.180> was<00:02:28.270> the<00:02:28.360> first<00:02:28.600> day

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:28.750 
infinitely it was it was the first day

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:30.180 
infinitely it was it was the first day
that<00:02:28.780> the<00:02:29.020> game<00:02:29.140> had<00:02:29.290> come<00:02:29.470> out<00:02:29.560> on<00:02:29.620> console

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.190 
that the game had come out on console

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:32.550 
that the game had come out on console
and<00:02:30.460> it<00:02:30.790> wasn't<00:02:31.000> a<00:02:31.180> viable<00:02:31.390> method<00:02:31.690> to<00:02:32.050> log<00:02:32.290> out

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:32.560 
and it wasn't a viable method to log out

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:34.800 
and it wasn't a viable method to log out
and<00:02:32.800> log<00:02:33.070> back<00:02:33.100> in<00:02:33.550> because<00:02:33.820> it<00:02:34.210> was<00:02:34.390> taking<00:02:34.780> me

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:34.810 
and log back in because it was taking me

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:38.160 
and log back in because it was taking me
three<00:02:35.230> four<00:02:35.560> minutes<00:02:36.550> to<00:02:36.910> log<00:02:37.210> in<00:02:37.480> and<00:02:37.750> log<00:02:37.810> out

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:38.170 
three four minutes to log in and log out

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:40.290 
three four minutes to log in and log out
because<00:02:38.920> the<00:02:39.100> servers<00:02:39.460> were<00:02:39.610> so<00:02:39.790> jacked<00:02:40.090> up

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:40.300 
because the servers were so jacked up

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:41.670 
because the servers were so jacked up
and<00:02:40.450> it<00:02:40.540> was<00:02:40.630> giving<00:02:40.870> me<00:02:40.900> some<00:02:41.140> error<00:02:41.380> message

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680 
and it was giving me some error message

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:43.920 
and it was giving me some error message
this<00:02:42.130> may<00:02:42.310> take<00:02:42.490> a<00:02:42.550> while<00:02:42.700> and<00:02:42.880> it<00:02:43.180> was<00:02:43.210> so<00:02:43.720> I

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:43.930 
this may take a while and it was so I

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:45.540 
this may take a while and it was so I
didn't<00:02:44.380> really<00:02:44.530> recommend<00:02:44.950> that<00:02:44.980> method<00:02:45.370> yet

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:45.550 
didn't really recommend that method yet

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:47.700 
didn't really recommend that method yet
but<00:02:45.940> now<00:02:46.180> I<00:02:46.210> do<00:02:46.450> because<00:02:46.930> the<00:02:47.050> server's<00:02:47.410> aren't

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:47.710 
but now I do because the server's aren't

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:50.490 
but now I do because the server's aren't
as<00:02:47.980> convoluted<00:02:48.550> and<00:02:48.970> not<00:02:49.900> everybody's<00:02:50.320> trying

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.500 
as convoluted and not everybody's trying

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:51.900 
as convoluted and not everybody's trying
to<00:02:50.530> get<00:02:50.650> on<00:02:50.740> there<00:02:50.890> at<00:02:50.950> once<00:02:51.160> so<00:02:51.430> once<00:02:51.670> you<00:02:51.760> get

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:51.910 
to get on there at once so once you get

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:53.610 
to get on there at once so once you get
done<00:02:52.060> stealing<00:02:52.360> everything<00:02:52.720> you're<00:02:53.470> gonna

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:53.620 
done stealing everything you're gonna

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:55.290 
done stealing everything you're gonna
want<00:02:53.890> to<00:02:53.950> log<00:02:54.220> out<00:02:54.430> of<00:02:54.460> your<00:02:54.670> character<00:02:55.120> and

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:55.300 
want to log out of your character and

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:57.030 
want to log out of your character and
then<00:02:55.420> just<00:02:55.570> log<00:02:55.780> back<00:02:56.020> in<00:02:56.260> and<00:02:56.470> that's<00:02:56.590> taking

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.040 
then just log back in and that's taking

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:59.850 
then just log back in and that's taking
right<00:02:57.730> around<00:02:58.030> 30<00:02:58.300> seconds<00:02:58.750> to<00:02:58.900> 45<00:02:59.350> seconds

00:02:59.850 --> 00:02:59.860 
right around 30 seconds to 45 seconds

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:02.790 
right around 30 seconds to 45 seconds
much<00:03:00.790> faster<00:03:01.300> than<00:03:01.480> it<00:03:01.660> was<00:03:01.840> before<00:03:02.140> and<00:03:02.410> now

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:02.800 
much faster than it was before and now

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:04.230 
much faster than it was before and now
I'm<00:03:02.980> this<00:03:03.550> is<00:03:03.700> which<00:03:03.850> is<00:03:03.970> why<00:03:04.120> I'm

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:04.240 
I'm this is which is why I'm

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:06.480 
I'm this is which is why I'm
recommending<00:03:04.510> it<00:03:04.840> now<00:03:05.130> once<00:03:06.130> you<00:03:06.220> have<00:03:06.250> all

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:06.490

the artisans area and that's where
you'll<00:03:15.430> break<00:03:15.610> everything<00:03:15.910> down<00:03:16.060> and

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:16.390 
you'll break everything down and

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:18.870 
you'll break everything down and
deconstruct<00:03:16.900> them<00:03:17.100> if<00:03:18.100> the<00:03:18.430> more<00:03:18.640> inventory

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:21.690 
deconstruct them if the more inventory
spots<00:03:19.360> you<00:03:19.510> have<00:03:19.540> the<00:03:20.140> better<00:03:20.320> so<00:03:21.070> if<00:03:21.370> you<00:03:21.520> can

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:21.700 
spots you have the better so if you can

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:23.130 
spots you have the better so if you can
upgrade<00:03:21.910> your<00:03:22.150> inventory<00:03:22.690> I've<00:03:22.960> only

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:23.140 
upgrade your inventory I've only

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:25.800 
upgrade your inventory I've only
upgraded<00:03:23.620> once<00:03:23.860> on<00:03:24.070> this<00:03:24.160> character<00:03:24.810> you

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:25.810 
upgraded once on this character you

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:28.440 
upgraded once on this character you
spend<00:03:26.080> the<00:03:26.170> money<00:03:26.290> 400<00:03:26.980> coin<00:03:27.220> or<00:03:27.550> 4<00:03:27.820> gold<00:03:28.210> is

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:28.450 
spend the money 400 coin or 4 gold is

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:32.400 
spend the money 400 coin or 4 gold is
well<00:03:28.810> worth<00:03:29.050> it<00:03:29.320> for<00:03:29.350> 10<00:03:29.950> more<00:03:30.130> spots<00:03:31.410> so

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:32.410 
well worth it for 10 more spots so

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:33.690 
well worth it for 10 more spots so
recommend<00:03:32.830> doing<00:03:33.040> at<00:03:33.160> least<00:03:33.370> the<00:03:33.490> first

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:33.700 
recommend doing at least the first

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:35.310 
recommend doing at least the first
upgrade<00:03:34.090> the<00:03:34.210> second<00:03:34.540> upgrade<00:03:34.660> I<00:03:34.870> think<00:03:35.170> is

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:35.320 
upgrade the second upgrade I think is

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:37.410 
upgrade the second upgrade I think is
like<00:03:35.560> two<00:03:35.770> thousand<00:03:36.310> gold<00:03:36.550> somewhere<00:03:37.240> in<00:03:37.390> that

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:37.420 
like two thousand gold somewhere in that

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:38.910 
like two thousand gold somewhere in that
range<00:03:37.660> so<00:03:37.840> it<00:03:38.020> gets<00:03:38.170> kind<00:03:38.230> of<00:03:38.410> expensive<00:03:38.620> but

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:38.920 
range so it gets kind of expensive but

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:41.460 
range so it gets kind of expensive but
it's<00:03:39.670> worth<00:03:39.790> it<00:03:40.120> to<00:03:40.240> crease<00:03:40.690> your<00:03:40.810> inventory<00:03:41.230> I

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:41.470 
it's worth it to crease your inventory I

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:43.620 
it's worth it to crease your inventory I
happen<00:03:42.130> to<00:03:42.160> like<00:03:42.460> this<00:03:42.730> armor<00:03:43.180> that<00:03:43.300> I<00:03:43.360> got

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:43.630 
happen to like this armor that I got

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:45.900 
happen to like this armor that I got
which<00:03:43.930> is<00:03:43.960> another<00:03:44.320> good<00:03:44.470> reason<00:03:44.530> to<00:03:44.830> steal<00:03:45.160> so

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:45.910 
which is another good reason to steal so

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:49.320 
which is another good reason to steal so
I'm<00:03:46.300> gonna<00:03:46.450> put<00:03:46.690> this<00:03:46.840> armor<00:03:47.350> on<00:03:48.090> you<00:03:49.090> can<00:03:49.210> see

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:50.700 
I'm gonna put this armor on you can see
it's<00:03:49.480> much<00:03:49.660> better<00:03:49.930> than<00:03:50.110> what<00:03:50.260> I<00:03:50.290> have<00:03:50.530> so<00:03:50.650> I'm

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:50.710 
it's much better than what I have so I'm

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:52.140 
it's much better than what I have so I'm
gonna<00:03:50.800> put<00:03:50.950> this<00:03:51.010> armor<00:03:51.400> on<00:03:51.550> and<00:03:51.940> then<00:03:52.030> I'm

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:52.150 
gonna put this armor on and then I'm

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:54.000 
gonna put this armor on and then I'm
gonna<00:03:52.240> take<00:03:52.480> it<00:03:52.630> to<00:03:52.690> the<00:03:52.780> refuge<00:03:53.170> not<00:03:53.770> in<00:03:53.890> this

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:54.010 
gonna take it to the refuge not in this

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:57.900 
gonna take it to the refuge not in this
video<00:03:54.250> but<00:03:54.430> later<00:03:54.670> and<00:03:55.030> then<00:03:55.150> have<00:03:55.420> it<00:03:56.760> have<00:03:57.760> it

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:57.910 
video but later and then have it have it

00:03:57.910 --> 00:03:59.310 
video but later and then have it have it
laundered<00:03:58.120> and<00:03:58.450> then<00:03:58.690> it<00:03:58.810> won't<00:03:58.900> be<00:03:59.080> stolen

00:03:59.310 --> 00:03:59.320 
laundered and then it won't be stolen

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:01.130 
laundered and then it won't be stolen
anymore<00:03:59.740> so<00:03:59.980> it's<00:04:00.220> well<00:04:00.370> worth<00:04:00.400> it<00:04:00.820> for<00:04:00.970> the

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:01.140 
anymore so it's well worth it for the

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:03.630 
anymore so it's well worth it for the
four<00:04:02.140> or<00:04:02.320> five<00:04:02.530> gold<00:04:02.950> I<00:04:03.130> need<00:04:03.280> to<00:04:03.370> spend

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:03.640 
four or five gold I need to spend

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:05.100 
four or five gold I need to spend
because<00:04:03.820> that<00:04:04.060> armor<00:04:04.480> would<00:04:04.600> be<00:04:04.750> a<00:04:04.780> lot<00:04:04.960> more

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:05.110 
because that armor would be a lot more

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:07.350 
because that armor would be a lot more
expensive<00:04:05.290> I<00:04:05.740> bought<00:04:05.770> it<00:04:06.160> so<00:04:07.000> now<00:04:07.120> I've<00:04:07.240> got

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:07.360 
expensive I bought it so now I've got

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:08.880 
expensive I bought it so now I've got
everything<00:04:07.480> broken<00:04:07.870> down<00:04:08.140> it's<00:04:08.500> just<00:04:08.530> a<00:04:08.680> quick

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:08.890 
everything broken down it's just a quick

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:10.260

out over and over again you can at least

00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:58.570 
out over and over again you can at least
make<00:04:57.020> a<00:04:57.170> couple<00:04:57.440> of<00:04:57.590> trips<00:04:57.740> before<00:04:58.310> you<00:04:58.460> need

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:38.480 
levels you get some really awesome

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:40.600 
levels you get some really awesome
weapons<00:05:39.020> that<00:05:39.200> will<00:05:39.320> let<00:05:39.680> that<00:05:40.010> will<00:05:40.190> drop<00:05:40.400> and

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:40.610 
weapons that will let that will drop and

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:42.010 
weapons that will let that will drop and
then<00:05:40.730> won't<00:05:41.150> be<00:05:41.270> stolen<00:05:41.510> because<00:05:41.780> they're

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:42.020 
then won't be stolen because they're

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:45.880 
then won't be stolen because they're
dropped<00:05:42.260> by<00:05:42.380> characters<00:05:42.860> or<00:05:43.340> NPCs<00:05:43.940> but<00:05:44.890> that's

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:45.890 
dropped by characters or NPCs but that's

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:48.100 
dropped by characters or NPCs but that's
again<00:05:46.220> at<00:05:46.370> higher<00:05:46.550> levels<00:05:47.000> so<00:05:47.300> at<00:05:47.870> the<00:05:47.960> lower

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:48.110 
again at higher levels so at the lower

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:50.080 
again at higher levels so at the lower
levels<00:05:48.500> of<00:05:48.590> the<00:05:48.650> game<00:05:48.860> where<00:05:49.820> you're<00:05:49.970> really

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:50.090 
levels of the game where you're really

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:51.580 
levels of the game where you're really
grinding<00:05:50.540> out<00:05:50.720> this<00:05:50.960> is<00:05:51.080> still<00:05:51.320> the<00:05:51.440> best

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:51.590 
grinding out this is still the best

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:53.830 
grinding out this is still the best
method<00:05:52.010> that<00:05:52.100> I've<00:05:52.250> found<00:05:52.490> to<00:05:53.090> make<00:05:53.240> gold<00:05:53.510> fast

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:53.840 
method that I've found to make gold fast

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:55.780 
method that I've found to make gold fast
and<00:05:54.170> really<00:05:54.800> you're<00:05:54.920> exploiting<00:05:55.460> the<00:05:55.580> system

00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:55.790 
and really you're exploiting the system

00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:57.580 
and really you're exploiting the system
because<00:05:56.210> you're<00:05:56.330> logging<00:05:56.570> out<00:05:56.870> long<00:05:57.140> back<00:05:57.380> in

00:05:57.580 --> 00:05:57.590 
because you're logging out long back in

00:05:57.590 --> 00:05:59.260 
because you're logging out long back in
and<00:05:57.830> then<00:05:57.950> the<00:05:58.010> items<00:05:58.310> are<00:05:58.430> there<00:05:58.580> some<00:05:59.150> will

00:05:59.260 --> 00:05:59.270 
and then the items are there some will

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:00.970 
and then the items are there some will
say<00:05:59.390> it's<00:05:59.510> part<00:05:59.660> of<00:05:59.720> the<00:05:59.810> game<00:05:59.930> mechanics<00:06:00.110> some

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:00.980 
say it's part of the game mechanics some

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:02.680 
say it's part of the game mechanics some
won't<00:06:01.220> well<00:06:01.520> I<00:06:01.550> call<00:06:01.940> it<00:06:01.970> exploiting<00:06:02.510> means

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:02.690 
won't well I call it exploiting means

00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:04.450 
won't well I call it exploiting means
you're<00:06:02.840> taking<00:06:03.110> advantage<00:06:03.380> every<00:06:03.740> advantage

00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:04.460 
you're taking advantage every advantage

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:06.790 
you're taking advantage every advantage
of<00:06:04.580> what's<00:06:04.790> given<00:06:05.060> to<00:06:05.180> you<00:06:05.410> well<00:06:06.410> that's<00:06:06.530> it

00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:06.800 
of what's given to you well that's it

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:08.860 
of what's given to you well that's it
guys<00:06:06.830> I<00:06:07.370> hope<00:06:07.700> you<00:06:08.000> enjoyed<00:06:08.360> it<00:06:08.480> I'm<00:06:08.570> gonna<00:06:08.690> do

guys I hope you enjoyed it I'm gonna do

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:10.780 
guys I hope you enjoyed it I'm gonna do
a<00:06:08.900> video<00:06:09.170> on<00:06:09.290> all<00:06:09.590> three<00:06:09.920> cities<00:06:10.190> and<00:06:10.610> all

00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:10.790 
a video on all three cities and all

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:13.330 
a video on all three cities and all
three<00:06:11.000> alliances<00:06:11.270> so<00:06:11.720> look<00:06:11.900> for<00:06:12.080> that<00:06:12.340> it's

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:13.340 
three alliances so look for that it's

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:15.610 
three alliances so look for that it's
hard<00:06:13.580> to<00:06:13.670> do<00:06:13.820> just<00:06:14.120> one<00:06:14.780> video<00:06:14.990> because

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:15.620 
hard to do just one video because

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:16.930 
hard to do just one video because
obviously<00:06:15.980> everybody's<00:06:16.730> in<00:06:16.850> a<00:06:16.910> different

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:16.940 
obviously everybody's in a different

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:19.150
