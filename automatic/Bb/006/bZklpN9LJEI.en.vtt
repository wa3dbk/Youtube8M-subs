00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:18.580
 and that's the continuation of our support 

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:20.790
 barn for my assistant sides 

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:23.079
 preferred under 

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:25.720
 now let's see how to change the 

00:00:23.079 --> 00:00:27.489
 meaning of the seams of happiness specify 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:28.689
 only with a band bra 

00:00:27.489 --> 00:00:30.399
 whole 

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:34.030
 the frame are outside the 

00:00:30.399 --> 00:00:38.350
 cap isolate for a moment the cap to 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:41.859
 from point b measured 5 cm and put 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:44.670
 their peers x connect point x to the point 

00:00:41.859 --> 00:00:46.960
 that's the point it's at point i 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.530
 take the opportunity to ask their peers 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:53.769
 corresponding on the central plate 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:57.820
 like this then starting from the point g 

00:00:53.769 --> 00:01:01.269
 measured 4 cm in the direction of 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:03.609
 their father there to avoid any possible 

00:01:01.269 --> 00:01:06.280
 confusion marcourt the center of the cap 

00:01:03.609 --> 00:01:08.380
 with a fancy landmark Grab you 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:10.270
 of a pair of paper scissors is 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:14.500
 carefully cut along the 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:17.350
 yx line rotates the news 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:19.750
 parts of the cup thus released and 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:23.460
 secure them with scotch 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:23.460
 on the legs 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:29.800
 it's time to connect y point to 

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:31.960
 winners point why exactly 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:33.850
 we where we are cut 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:38.140
 carefully this little piece and the 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:39.820
 throw in the trash a space have a little 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:43.270
 parts for clarity 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:46.780
 now we will round soften 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:47.800
 the line y b with the parrot you 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:49.630
 remember that it's manning who 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:54.100
 corresponds to the neckline a balloon at 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:56.350
 far are softened are also the 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:02:00.320
 organs that correspond to the tip of the 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:02.970
 breast and we get these 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:05.700
 achieve this step with the biggest 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:09.450
 care because it is imperative that both 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:13.110
 lines ix be exactly the same 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:16.100
 length otherwise the cap would be everything 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:16.100
 distorted any possible case 

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:21.710
 and so that's how one goes from one 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:26.050
 cup shape a vertical seam at 

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:26.050
 that of a horizontal seam there 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:32.020
 suppose we want to trade the 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.090
 plate height 

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:35.650
 it would be tempting is not it 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:41.200
 simply extend this line 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:44.770
 but that does not look like no no no 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:47.230
 like that at the end of the contract is not going because 

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:50.320
 we distort the room and reduce it 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:53.200
 what is needed is going down the line 

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:56.140
 down here in blue and connect it to the 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:59.010
 plate like that no shift and no 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:59.010
 loss of measures 

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:04.630
 martin 

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:07.440
 a drama there I'm tired I have them 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:10.390
 eyes that cross their arms 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:14.070
 no game are so now eh bah I 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:14.070
 will do it tomorrow I'm full 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:44.949
