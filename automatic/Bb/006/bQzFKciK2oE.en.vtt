after<00:02:34.750> and<00:02:35.140> I<00:02:35.530> feel<00:02:35.710> like<00:02:35.770> I<00:02:35.830> did<00:02:36.040> that<00:02:36.160> for<00:02:36.190> the

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:36.370 
after and I feel like I did that for the

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:38.790 
after and I feel like I did that for the
most<00:02:36.490> part<00:02:36.580> where<00:02:37.090> it<00:02:37.570> went<00:02:37.780> good<00:02:38.050> defense<00:02:38.620> I

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:38.800
