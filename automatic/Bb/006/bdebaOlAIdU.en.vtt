right there right here right here now
this<00:02:28.959> is<00:02:29.110> the<00:02:29.230> opposite<00:02:29.799> end<00:02:30.269> of<00:02:31.269> where<00:02:31.510> the

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:31.660 
this is the opposite end of where the

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:35.280 
this is the opposite end of where the
USB<00:02:32.200> plug<00:02:32.859> is<00:02:33.359> put<00:02:34.359> it<00:02:34.510> outside<00:02:34.630> there's<00:02:35.079> two

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
USB plug is put it outside there's two

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:41.900 
USB plug is put it outside there's two
right<00:02:35.410> there<00:02:39.840> kind<00:02:40.840> of<00:02:40.870> pry<00:02:41.109> that<00:02:41.290> one<00:02:41.410> off

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
right there kind of pry that one off

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:48.930 
right there kind of pry that one off
it's<00:02:42.910> a<00:02:42.970> little<00:02:43.269> bit

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:48.940 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:52.510 

there's<00:02:49.940> another<00:02:50.150> one<00:02:50.330> right<00:02:50.480> there<00:02:51.340> tip<00:02:52.340> same

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:52.520 
there's another one right there tip same

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:59.650 
there's another one right there tip same
side<00:02:54.099> when<00:02:55.099> tail<00:02:55.310> falling<00:02:55.730> off<00:02:58.060> open<00:02:59.060> it<00:02:59.150> now

00:02:59.650 --> 00:02:59.660 
side when tail falling off open it now

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:02.199 
side when tail falling off open it now
don't<00:02:59.870> just<00:03:00.140> pull<00:03:00.500> it<00:03:00.620> like<00:03:00.739> this<00:03:00.970> I'll<00:03:01.970> break

00:03:02.199 --> 00:03:02.209 
don't just pull it like this I'll break

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:03.699 
don't just pull it like this I'll break
it<00:03:02.330> off<00:03:02.390> cuz<00:03:02.630> it<00:03:02.720> will<00:03:02.810> break<00:03:03.020> right<00:03:03.470> in<00:03:03.620> the

00:03:03.699 --> 00:03:03.709 
it off cuz it will break right in the

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:05.650 
it off cuz it will break right in the
middle<00:03:03.860> and<00:03:04.640> you<00:03:04.760> won't<00:03:04.970> really<00:03:05.150> be<00:03:05.390> able<00:03:05.420> to

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:05.660 
middle and you won't really be able to

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:26.310 
middle and you won't really be able to
use<00:03:05.780> a<00:03:05.810> case<00:03:06.080> that<00:03:06.290> well

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:26.320 

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:29.890 

so<00:03:27.320> there's<00:03:27.470> some<00:03:27.590> glue<00:03:27.830> stuck<00:03:28.570> see<00:03:29.570> the<00:03:29.690> drive

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:29.900 
so there's some glue stuck see the drive

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:36.010 
so there's some glue stuck see the drive
in<00:03:30.020> there<00:03:30.550> there<00:03:31.720> pops<00:03:32.720> up<00:03:34.180> the<00:03:35.180> case<00:03:35.390> is<00:03:35.630> metal

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:36.020 
in there there pops up the case is metal

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:37.630 
in there there pops up the case is metal
so<00:03:36.230> it's<00:03:36.560> okay<00:03:36.830> if<00:03:36.860> it<00:03:37.010> looks<00:03:37.160> a<00:03:37.250> little<00:03:37.340> bent

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:37.640 
so it's okay if it looks a little bent

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:38.910 
so it's okay if it looks a little bent
afterwards<00:03:38.090> you<00:03:38.300> can<00:03:38.390> straighten<00:03:38.720> that<00:03:38.810> out

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:38.920 
afterwards you can straighten that out

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:40.990 
afterwards you can straighten that out
it's<00:03:39.920> not<00:03:40.010> going<00:03:40.220> to<00:03:40.280> snap<00:03:40.490> it's<00:03:40.670> not<00:03:40.790> a<00:03:40.820> piece

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:41.000 
it's not going to snap it's not a piece

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.140 
it's not going to snap it's not a piece
of<00:03:41.030> plastic<00:03:42.550> anyway<00:03:43.550> so<00:03:43.610> you<00:03:43.730> could<00:03:43.850> discard

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:44.150 
of plastic anyway so you could discard

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:46.480 
of plastic anyway so you could discard
that<00:03:44.350> when<00:03:45.350> you<00:03:45.410> look<00:03:45.560> inside<00:03:45.740> you'll<00:03:46.370> see

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:46.490 
that when you look inside you'll see

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:48.280 
that when you look inside you'll see
that<00:03:46.610> the<00:03:46.730> drive<00:03:46.940> is<00:03:47.090> actually<00:03:47.690> a<00:03:47.720> samsung

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:48.290 
that the drive is actually a samsung

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:50.830 
that the drive is actually a samsung
don't<00:03:49.160> know<00:03:49.310> why<00:03:49.460> seek<00:03:50.270> it<00:03:50.390> doesn't<00:03:50.630> use<00:03:50.720> their

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:50.840 
don't know why seek it doesn't use their

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:52.930 
don't know why seek it doesn't use their
own<00:03:50.930> drives<00:03:51.200> but<00:03:51.380> hey<00:03:51.580> who<00:03:52.580> would<00:03:52.730> complain

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:52.940 
own drives but hey who would complain

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:56.530 
own drives but hey who would complain
it's<00:03:53.240> a<00:03:53.390> samsung<00:03:53.990> mementos<00:03:55.180> so<00:03:56.180> you'll<00:03:56.300> see<00:03:56.480> it
