as<00:00:16.059> we<00:00:16.390> continue<00:00:16.750> our<00:00:16.780> series<00:00:16.900> comparing<00:00:17.740> the

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:17.830 
as we continue our series comparing the

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:19.890 
as we continue our series comparing the
two<00:00:18.010> devices<00:00:18.160> now<00:00:18.940> they've<00:00:19.180> both<00:00:19.360> been<00:00:19.420> just

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:19.900 
two devices now they've both been just

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:21.960 
two devices now they've both been just
soft<00:00:20.230> reset<00:00:20.710> and<00:00:20.890> they're<00:00:21.010> running<00:00:21.310> the<00:00:21.789> same

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:21.970 
soft reset and they're running the same

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:23.940 
soft reset and they're running the same
sort<00:00:22.330> of<00:00:22.420> third<00:00:22.780> party<00:00:23.140> program<00:00:23.560> so<00:00:23.800> there's

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:23.950 
sort of third party program so there's

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:25.500 
sort of third party program so there's
no<00:00:24.100> background<00:00:24.490> processes<00:00:25.090> running<00:00:25.240> that

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:25.510 
no background processes running that

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:27.840 
no background processes running that
would<00:00:25.630> compromise<00:00:26.380> one<00:00:26.800> of<00:00:26.890> the<00:00:26.980> devices<00:00:27.250> and

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:27.850 
would compromise one of the devices and

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:29.400 
would compromise one of the devices and
we're<00:00:27.970> going<00:00:28.090> to<00:00:28.120> start<00:00:28.420> off<00:00:28.600> in<00:00:28.870> the<00:00:28.960> program

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:29.410 
we're going to start off in the program

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:31.290 
we're going to start off in the program
screen<00:00:29.770> and<00:00:29.890> we're<00:00:29.980> going<00:00:30.100> to<00:00:30.130> go<00:00:30.310> to<00:00:30.370> various

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:31.300 
screen and we're going to go to various

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:32.519 
screen and we're going to go to various
other<00:00:31.540> screens<00:00:31.900> and<00:00:32.110> test<00:00:32.290> different

00:00:32.519 --> 00:00:32.529 
other screens and test different

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:36.740 
other screens and test different
scenarios<00:00:33.070> here<00:00:34.410> about<00:00:35.410> the<00:00:35.559> same<00:00:35.770> their

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
scenarios here about the same their

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.950 
scenarios here about the same their
Xperia<00:00:37.750> was<00:00:37.870> slightly<00:00:38.140> faster<00:00:38.469> they're<00:00:39.960> about

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:40.960 
Xperia was slightly faster they're about

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:47.520 
Xperia was slightly faster they're about
the<00:00:41.170> same<00:00:41.589> maybe<00:00:42.219> expiry<00:00:46.050> Xperia<00:00:47.050> was<00:00:47.199> faster

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:47.530 
the same maybe expiry Xperia was faster

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:50.579 
the same maybe expiry Xperia was faster
their<00:00:48.780> overall<00:00:49.780> they're<00:00:49.960> about<00:00:50.109> the<00:00:50.289> same<00:00:50.440> the

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:50.589 
their overall they're about the same the

00:00:50.589 --> 00:00:52.919 
their overall they're about the same the
Xperia<00:00:50.949> is<00:00:51.010> slightly<00:00:51.399> faster<00:00:51.850> let's<00:00:52.600> try

00:00:52.919 --> 00:00:52.929 
Xperia is slightly faster let's try

00:00:52.929 --> 00:00:54.329 
Xperia is slightly faster let's try
something<00:00:53.199> else<00:00:53.440> let's<00:00:53.649> go<00:00:53.769> to<00:00:53.859> opera<00:00:54.309> and

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:54.339 
something else let's go to opera and

00:00:54.339 --> 00:00:57.149 
something else let's go to opera and
load<00:00:54.699> the<00:00:54.850> same<00:00:55.059> web<00:00:55.300> page<00:00:55.539> over<00:00:55.870> Wi-Fi<00:00:56.100> ok<00:00:57.100> so

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:57.159 
load the same web page over Wi-Fi ok so

00:00:57.159 --> 00:00:59.009 
load the same web page over Wi-Fi ok so
here<00:00:57.429> we<00:00:57.519> are<00:00:57.670> on<00:00:57.819> CNN<00:00:58.239> com<00:00:58.600> a<00:00:58.629> somewhat

00:00:59.009 --> 00:00:59.019 
here we are on CNN com a somewhat

00:00:59.019 --> 00:01:00.809 
here we are on CNN com a somewhat
complex<00:00:59.499> web<00:00:59.800> page<00:01:00.039> and<00:01:00.219> let's<00:01:00.370> see<00:01:00.519> how<00:01:00.670> they

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:00.819 
complex web page and let's see how they

00:01:00.819 --> 00:01:07.740 
complex web page and let's see how they
do<00:01:00.879> in<00:01:01.089> the<00:01:01.179> rotation<00:01:01.510> of<00:01:01.780> this<00:01:06.420> x1<00:01:07.420> a<00:01:07.540> little

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:07.750 
do in the rotation of this x1 a little

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:23.580 
do in the rotation of this x1 a little
faster

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:23.590 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:26.069 

so<00:01:24.250> overall<00:01:24.399> I<00:01:24.520> think<00:01:24.609> the<00:01:24.820> x1<00:01:25.210> is<00:01:25.329> faster<00:01:25.780> in

00:01:26.069 --> 00:01:26.079 
so overall I think the x1 is faster in

00:01:26.079 --> 00:01:28.349 
so overall I think the x1 is faster in
Opera<00:01:26.409> Mobile<00:01:26.560> okay<00:01:27.460> here<00:01:27.609> both<00:01:27.789> devices<00:01:28.119> are

00:01:28.349 --> 00:01:28.359 
Opera Mobile okay here both devices are

00:01:28.359 --> 00:01:31.410 
Opera Mobile okay here both devices are
on<00:01:28.509> the<00:01:28.600> same<00:01:28.840> PDF<00:01:29.439> in<00:01:29.679> the<00:01:30.039> same<00:01:30.280> view<00:01:30.609> zoomed

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:31.420 
on the same PDF in the same view zoomed

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:32.849 
on the same PDF in the same view zoomed
in<00:01:31.600> one<00:01:31.780> time<00:01:32.049> so<00:01:32.229> let's<00:01:32.409> see<00:01:32.560> how<00:01:32.649> they<00:01:32.799> do

00:01:32.849 --> 00:01:32.859 
in one time so let's see how they do

00:01:32.859 --> 00:01:41.760 
in one time so let's see how they do
with<00:01:33.670> this<00:01:33.939> PDF<00:01:39.360> well<00:01:40.360> let's<00:01:41.289> try<00:01:41.409> to<00:01:41.469> get<00:01:41.649> it

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:41.770 
with this PDF well let's try to get it

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:50.420 
with this PDF well let's try to get it
together

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:53.860 

the<00:01:50.880> x1<00:01:51.180> is<00:01:51.270> slightly<00:01:51.450> faster<00:01:51.720> once<00:01:52.080> again

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:53.870 
the x1 is slightly faster once again

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:56.270 
the x1 is slightly faster once again
okay<00:01:54.870> so<00:01:54.930> both<00:01:55.200> of<00:01:55.230> these<00:01:55.380> devices<00:01:55.740> exhibit

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
okay so both of these devices exhibit

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.190 
okay so both of these devices exhibit
very<00:01:56.310> fast<00:01:56.820> screen<00:01:57.120> rotation<00:01:57.450> faster<00:01:57.960> than<00:01:58.170> a

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
very fast screen rotation faster than a

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.350 
very fast screen rotation faster than a
lot<00:01:58.470> of<00:01:58.590> devices<00:01:58.950> out<00:01:59.100> there<00:01:59.130> but<00:01:59.700> the<00:01:59.820> x1<00:02:00.240> is

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
lot of devices out there but the x1 is

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.080 
lot of devices out there but the x1 is
just<00:02:00.570> slightly<00:02:00.900> faster<00:02:01.580> most<00:02:02.580> of<00:02:02.760> the<00:02:02.880> time

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
just slightly faster most of the time

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.060 
just slightly faster most of the time
then<00:02:03.420> the<00:02:03.600> touch<00:02:03.780> pro<00:02:03.990> so<00:02:04.530> that's<00:02:04.710> it<00:02:04.800> for<00:02:04.860> this

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
then the touch pro so that's it for this

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.940 
then the touch pro so that's it for this
part<00:02:05.310> of<00:02:05.370> the<00:02:05.430> comparison
