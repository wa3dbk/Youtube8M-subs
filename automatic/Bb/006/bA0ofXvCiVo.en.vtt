on<00:00:04.980> Hellena<00:00:05.759> we<00:00:06.210> wanted<00:00:06.569> to<00:00:06.660> give<00:00:06.870> her<00:00:07.049> length

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:07.440 
on Hellena we wanted to give her length

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.299 
on Hellena we wanted to give her length
and<00:00:07.770> under<00:00:08.309> color<00:00:08.550> so<00:00:09.330> the<00:00:09.750> first<00:00:10.110> row<00:00:10.500> was

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
and under color so the first row was

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:14.240 
and under color so the first row was
started<00:00:11.759> off<00:00:11.940> using<00:00:12.300> a<00:00:12.690> solid<00:00:13.049> row<00:00:13.530> of<00:00:13.860> a

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
started off using a solid row of a

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.060 
started off using a solid row of a
copper<00:00:14.790> red<00:00:15.000> we<00:00:15.750> first<00:00:16.020> began<00:00:16.410> by<00:00:16.680> relaxing

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
copper red we first began by relaxing

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.790 
copper red we first began by relaxing
her<00:00:17.430> hair<00:00:17.730> and<00:00:17.970> then<00:00:18.630> flat<00:00:19.050> ironing<00:00:19.590> it

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
her hair and then flat ironing it

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.890 
her hair and then flat ironing it
especially<00:00:20.310> at<00:00:20.699> the<00:00:20.910> roots<00:00:21.150> so<00:00:21.359> that<00:00:21.630> when<00:00:21.779> we

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
especially at the roots so that when we

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.390 
especially at the roots so that when we
apply<00:00:22.170> the<00:00:22.289> bonds<00:00:23.100> it<00:00:23.250> has<00:00:23.730> a<00:00:23.760> nice<00:00:24.150> connection

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:25.400 
apply the bonds it has a nice connection

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:29.419 
apply the bonds it has a nice connection
the<00:00:26.400> first<00:00:26.730> row<00:00:27.090> is<00:00:27.480> just<00:00:27.990> at<00:00:28.170> the<00:00:28.410> mid<00:00:28.740> year<00:00:29.039> we

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
the first row is just at the mid year we

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:32.290 
the first row is just at the mid year we
didn't<00:00:29.730> have<00:00:29.910> to<00:00:30.060> start<00:00:30.330> real<00:00:30.689> low<00:00:30.990> on<00:00:31.260> her

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:32.300 
didn't have to start real low on her

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:36.410 
didn't have to start real low on her
with<00:00:33.300> our<00:00:33.469> resin<00:00:34.469> which<00:00:35.219> is<00:00:35.399> not<00:00:35.670> a<00:00:35.700> glue<00:00:36.090> it's

naturally derived when you go to retouch
her<00:00:39.719> hair<00:00:40.140> you<00:00:40.920> would<00:00:41.070> apply<00:00:41.309> the<00:00:41.430> relaxer<00:00:41.700> to

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
her hair you would apply the relaxer to

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.270 
her hair you would apply the relaxer to
the<00:00:42.840> roots<00:00:43.079> which<00:00:43.410> would<00:00:43.620> then<00:00:43.829> be<00:00:44.040> on<00:00:44.250> the

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
the roots which would then be on the

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.389 
the roots which would then be on the
other<00:00:44.550> side<00:00:44.760> of<00:00:45.570> the<00:00:46.230> bonds<00:00:46.770> because<00:00:47.070> the<00:00:47.190> hair

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
other side of the bonds because the hair

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.610 
other side of the bonds because the hair
is<00:00:47.430> now<00:00:47.640> grown<00:00:48.000> off<00:00:48.239> from<00:00:48.450> the<00:00:48.570> head<00:00:48.840> and<00:00:49.110> if

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
is now grown off from the head and if

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.760 
is now grown off from the head and if
you<00:00:49.860> were<00:00:50.010> to<00:00:50.129> get<00:00:50.340> any<00:00:50.640> of<00:00:50.969> the<00:00:51.270> relaxer<00:00:52.110> on

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
you were to get any of the relaxer on

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:58.790 
you were to get any of the relaxer on
the<00:00:53.129> bonds<00:00:53.760> it<00:00:53.940> will<00:00:54.390> not<00:00:54.660> remove<00:00:57.410> so<00:00:58.410> here<00:00:58.620> you

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
the bonds it will not remove so here you

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.630 
the bonds it will not remove so here you
can<00:00:58.980> see<00:00:59.340> Tammy<00:00:59.910> she's<00:01:00.660> applying<00:01:01.640> each

can see Tammy she's applying each

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.030 
can see Tammy she's applying each
extension<00:01:03.420> one<00:01:03.780> at<00:01:03.930> a<00:01:04.019> time<00:01:04.229> she<00:01:04.680> takes<00:01:04.920> a
