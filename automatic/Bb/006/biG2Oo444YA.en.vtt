00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:36.990 
yeah they're like that was how it was I

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:38.450 
yeah they're like that was how it was I
mean<00:02:37.320> you<00:02:37.380> had<00:02:37.500> plenty<00:02:37.740> of<00:02:37.860> speed<00:02:38.100> the<00:02:38.280> boat

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:38.460 
mean you had plenty of speed the boat

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:39.680 
mean you had plenty of speed the boat
looked<00:02:38.670> really<00:02:38.940> quick<00:02:39.150> to<00:02:39.270> me<00:02:39.390> I<00:02:39.420> don't<00:02:39.570> know

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
looked really quick to me I don't know

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:40.970 
looked really quick to me I don't know
how<00:02:39.780> fast<00:02:40.020> you<00:02:40.200> were<00:02:40.230> going<00:02:40.560> but<00:02:40.650> it<00:02:40.770> looks

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
how fast you were going but it looks

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.310 
how fast you were going but it looks
certainly<00:02:41.400> well<00:02:41.580> up<00:02:41.760> there<00:02:41.970> but<00:02:42.510> into<00:02:43.230> the

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:43.320 
certainly well up there but into the

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:44.720 
certainly well up there but into the
corners<00:02:43.710> they<00:02:43.860> just<00:02:44.100> seem<00:02:44.310> that<00:02:44.430> you<00:02:44.520> have<00:02:44.640> to

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
corners they just seem that you have to

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:45.980 
corners they just seem that you have to
get<00:02:44.820> on<00:02:44.940> the<00:02:45.000> brakes<00:02:45.210> a<00:02:45.300> bit<00:02:45.330> earlier<00:02:45.780> and<00:02:45.870> they

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:45.990 
get on the brakes a bit earlier and they

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:48.650 
get on the brakes a bit earlier and they
just<00:02:46.200> come<00:02:46.350> up<00:02:46.500> on<00:02:46.620> you<00:02:47.150> yeah<00:02:48.150> I<00:02:48.180> do

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
just come up on you yeah I do

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:50.630 
just come up on you yeah I do
the<00:02:49.170> right<00:02:49.470> way<00:02:49.590> as<00:02:49.740> you<00:02:49.890> can<00:02:50.010> see<00:02:50.190> I've<00:02:50.460> never

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 
the right way as you can see I've never

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:51.920 
the right way as you can see I've never
seen<00:02:50.940> like<00:02:51.090> there's<00:02:51.270> not<00:02:51.450> too<00:02:51.570> many<00:02:51.660> tunnels

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
seen like there's not too many tunnels

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:53.390 
seen like there's not too many tunnels
in<00:02:52.170> the<00:02:52.260> start<00:02:52.500> Australia<00:02:52.950> the<00:02:53.040> container<00:02:53.310> as

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
in the start Australia the container as

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.630 
in the start Australia the container as
quick<00:02:53.550> as<00:02:53.640> those<00:02:53.790> two<00:02:53.940> blokes<00:02:54.180> you<00:02:54.690> know<00:02:54.810> so

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:55.640 
quick as those two blokes you know so

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:57.710 
quick as those two blokes you know so
you<00:02:56.640> know<00:02:56.700> I<00:02:56.790> went<00:02:57.000> a<00:02:57.060> little<00:02:57.090> bit<00:02:57.300> deeper<00:02:57.390> than

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
you know I went a little bit deeper than

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:59.120 
you know I went a little bit deeper than
what<00:02:57.780> I<00:02:57.870> was<00:02:57.960> doing<00:02:58.080> in<00:02:58.170> the<00:02:58.230> other<00:02:58.350> races<00:02:58.620> and

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.130 
what I was doing in the other races and

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:03.650 
what I was doing in the other races and
I<00:03:00.410> just<00:03:01.410> go<00:03:01.770> have<00:03:02.430> a<00:03:02.490> judgement<00:03:03.030> to<00:03:03.180> see<00:03:03.360> that<00:03:03.570> I

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:03.660 
I just go have a judgement to see that I

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:04.460 
I just go have a judgement to see that I
don't<00:03:03.780> go<00:03:03.930> too<00:03:03.990> deep

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470 
don't go too deep

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:05.810 
don't go too deep
otherwise<00:03:04.860> I'll<00:03:05.100> do<00:03:05.220> a<00:03:05.250> bit<00:03:05.400> of<00:03:05.490> a<00:03:05.520> whoopsie

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:05.820 
otherwise I'll do a bit of a whoopsie

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:07.790 
otherwise I'll do a bit of a whoopsie
locative<00:03:06.180> down<00:03:06.390> there<00:03:06.630> and<00:03:07.020> the<00:03:07.110> other<00:03:07.230> one<00:03:07.320> if

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:07.800 
locative down there and the other one if

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:09.710 
locative down there and the other one if
I<00:03:07.860> go<00:03:07.980> too<00:03:08.040> deep<00:03:08.400> you<00:03:08.460> know<00:03:09.180> I'm<00:03:09.300> out<00:03:09.510> of<00:03:09.600> the

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 
I go too deep you know I'm out of the

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.960 
I go too deep you know I'm out of the
water<00:03:09.900> absolutely<00:03:10.710> right<00:03:11.370> so<00:03:11.610> it's<00:03:11.730> a<00:03:11.790> real

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:11.970 
water absolutely right so it's a real

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:13.700 
water absolutely right so it's a real
balance<00:03:12.300> between<00:03:12.450> power<00:03:12.900> and<00:03:13.200> finesse<00:03:13.380> and

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:13.710 
balance between power and finesse and

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:15.020 
balance between power and finesse and
trying<00:03:13.920> to<00:03:13.980> get<00:03:14.100> the<00:03:14.160> boat<00:03:14.280> round<00:03:14.460> the<00:03:14.640> Karuna

and<00:03:15.210> putting<00:03:15.480> the<00:03:15.540> power<00:03:15.690> down<00:03:15.870> coming<00:03:16.260> out

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:16.350 
and putting the power down coming out

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:19.040 
and putting the power down coming out
again<00:03:16.590> yeah<00:03:17.250> you<00:03:17.310> know<00:03:17.520> it<00:03:17.640> is<00:03:17.760> it's<00:03:18.060> yeah<00:03:18.959> and
