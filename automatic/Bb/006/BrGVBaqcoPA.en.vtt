00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:09.750
 hi all so today I 'm not 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:12.509
 happy to find you a new 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.860
 video that will be a duel so it's not 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:16.199
 badly of time I had not made a death 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.240
 ndiaye if I can say that because in 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:19.140
 my previous video to the five ideas for 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.600
 decorate your room 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.640
 where did I put pictures on 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.630
 the walls so it was not really a 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.789
 via rail itself 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:30.179
 so here I can if you understand me 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:32.009
 in short, say yes, it's me who told them 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.610
 invented in any case I did not see on 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.590
 other channels 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.450
 before then so in fact I got 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.910
 inspired by a t-shirt that comes from 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.800
 my city is listened to in the 30 euros 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.079
 I'm talking 30 dollar so that's close 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.489
 from 30 euros 

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:45.960
 and I thought, well, why not 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:48.840
 do it myself if I had to 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.160
 others it was perfect and then it's 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.570
 always better I find to do the 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.370
 things yourself rather than the 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.670
 buy on the whole woman cost less 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:58.800
 dear you buy so here's so 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.449
 you never want to realize and parent 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.149
 do not hesitate to post a photo of this 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:05.159
 that you did on instagram with the 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:07.850
 hashtag of the rather justin flocks 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:09.990
 the artist by identifying on the photo 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:12.960
 so my account is just this 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:15.930
 type an artist so here I hope that 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.530
 this job will please you and we find at the 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.479
 end of the video 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.700
 to make this t shirt I used 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:22.830
 so just a white t-shirt a 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:26.640
 pencil and textile felt 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:29.549
 black is what you need 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.259
 also a model for drawing the 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:32.909
 reason you want to sign them so 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:34.920
 I just took a model on 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:37.290
 my phone to start i have 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.490
 drawn at most a paper the pattern that 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.670
 I want to put on a tee shirt 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:43.020
 so I 'm doing them by show of hands so if 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.189
 never have you a little trouble for them 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.590
 sounded in spite of you can all 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:49.700
 simply print 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:50.990
 the good format pattern for after the 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:53.509
 cut into a stencil 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:55.460
 to help you so if you ever 

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:57.799
 still want to draw freehand 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:00.380
 I'll give you a tip that's 

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:02.450
 first do two straight lines 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:05.539
 actually one in gold and one down for 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:06.920
 although the letters are about the same 

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:09.289
 on the same alignment 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:11.209
 and if you ever have a doubt 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:12.440
 do not hesitate to try your t-shirt 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:13.819
 to see how that gives me 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:14.690
 that's what I did to see if he 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:16.310
 there are no letters that are a little 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:18.410
 Too much left or right etc 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:20.180
 after having defined the letters 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:22.069
 paper documents I come to take a 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:24.200
 fairly thick cardboard paper that I put 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:25.730
 inside my t-shirt to avoid 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:27.260
 that fire too one base on the other 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:30.560
 side and so I come then take 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:32.510
 my textile felt to draw everything 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:36.760
 first the outline of the letters and 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:36.760
 then fill them in coloring 

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:06.590
 after you finish drawing the pattern of 

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:08.420
 shirt I only have their past to 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:12.010
 upside down for five minutes for good 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:12.010
 that the patterns are embedded in the fabric 

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:22.189
 result so as you can see 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:24.530
 I would not say that I did 

00:03:22.189 --> 00:03:27.650
 the t-shirt so it helps me 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:29.450
 save about 20 euros and I 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:31.459
 am super happy with the result we see 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:32.840
 the video and I hope she will have you 

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:35.569
 more as usual you put everything in 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:38.049
 info bar so things you 

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:40.760
 buy so what's the style at 

00:03:38.049 --> 00:03:42.049
 textile and all sources 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:43.579
 of information that music I have 

00:03:42.049 --> 00:03:44.750
 left and so on do not hesitate to go 

00:03:43.579 --> 00:03:47.420
 see my info bar 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:49.310
 thank you for your mails on my mailbox 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:51.950
 that I received it is super nice I you 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:54.560
 have responded normally and do not hesitate 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:56.389
 to send me others I do not find myself 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:58.639
 unfortunately next week because 

00:03:56.389 --> 00:03:59.269
 I will go on vacation I will come back 

00:03:58.639 --> 00:04:01.280
 end of August 

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:03.950
 so do not worry, it's not 

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:07.819
 as far as I have not lost the site 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:09.109
 videos finally I hope I would have you 

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:10.760
 filming videos during the holidays 

00:04:09.109 --> 00:04:13.010
 where I'm going to go maybe in bulk 

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:15.620
 I know and I pastors and when 

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:18.139
 I would have come back so maybe there will be 

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:19.609
 more videos at once to catch up 

00:04:18.139 --> 00:04:21.049
 precisely the fact that I made one 

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:24.169
 little less during the holidays 

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:26.930
 so here you do not want to say but 

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:27.650
 next year so I suprise 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:32.060
 General High School 

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:34.039
 in European English section so that 

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:35.630
 add two more hours in 

00:04:34.039 --> 00:04:37.000
 the schedule and I also took 

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:39.500
 the plastic arts option that adds me 

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.360
 three hours so that does not give me 5 

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:42.530
 hours on my employee because normal of 

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:44.300
 two seconds 

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:46.580
 so I think maybe I'll 

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:49.190
 have less opposite of video do you 

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:51.139
 would not I will try anyway in 

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:52.849
 to keep up a steady pace maybe 

00:04:51.139 --> 00:04:54.409
 not had this once a week and 

00:04:52.849 --> 00:04:56.570
 maybe more a joust both 

00:04:54.409 --> 00:04:58.639
 weeks something like that short I 

00:04:56.570 --> 00:05:00.020
 would see well when I'm here but 

00:04:58.639 --> 00:05:01.880
 that was just to keep you 

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:04.550
 not that you're touring that at the 

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:06.919
 back home jean the post less than 

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:08.900
 What good now but hopefully it 

00:05:06.919 --> 00:05:11.120
 going too disturbing even if they are in 

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:13.250
 not here yet so here I am doing you 

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:17.139
 big kisses and I come back so late August 

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:17.139
 for a new video lease
