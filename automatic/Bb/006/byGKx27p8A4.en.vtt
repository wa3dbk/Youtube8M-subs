00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:15.120
 deeply mistaken if he thinks that 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:15.990
 for the sake of this expensive rubbish

 comments 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.900
 party or country will continue to endure 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.550
 this useless expensive 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:29.609
 illegal and extremely dangerous military 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:31.500
 the toy on its territory is so sharp 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.660
 the reaction could have been caused by accusations 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.380
 on the part of the British submariner pour out 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.420
 and darks 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.489
 the whistleblower posted on wikileaks 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.469
 detailed report in which talked about 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.899
 security flaws on 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:44.820
 aboard British submarines in 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:46.860
 the document says that these submarines 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.379
 poorly guarded on them does not exist 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.750
 seafarers ’search and baggage check system 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.670
 most of the equipment is faulty and 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.010
 unknown whether start 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.390
 missiles without consequences 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:59.550
 the whistleblower also reported that the text 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.800
 nuclear missiles was turned sailors 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.539
 to the gym the authorities conducted an investigation 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.309
 on charges dubbed 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:08.070
 and said they didn't find any 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.930
 security breaches while doing so 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.880
 the whistleblower did not receive a statement 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.619
 proper coverage in the British media 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.049
 so wikileaks founder julian 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:18.420
 Assange believes that the Ministry of Defense 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:20.100
 make a warning prohibiting 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.650
 touch on safety issues 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.270
 nuclear facilities according to representatives 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.950
 wikileaks media should be carefully 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.590
 investigate this information and 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.990
 official service if it is not an order 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.299
 above that the British media simply 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.130
 ignores important statements they don't 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:36.840
 bother to study carefully 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.360
 detailed qualified report 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.909
 submariner macnile doubt that 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:44.189
 London’s position on this issue will weaken 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:46.200
 anxiety the people of scotland who 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.759
 forced to live side by side with potential 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.649
 threatened 

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:51.570
 I hope the media will get down to business and yet 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:53.909
 try to thoroughly investigate this 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:57.380
 the Government had also apparently 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:57.380
 trying to mislead us
