finger<00:03:47.459> across<00:03:47.639> the<00:03:47.730> status<00:03:48.299> bar<00:03:48.329> there<00:03:48.660> which

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:48.810 
finger across the status bar there which

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:50.720 
finger across the status bar there which
some<00:03:49.290> people<00:03:49.410> like<00:03:49.709> I<00:03:49.889> don't<00:03:50.010> really<00:03:50.400> care

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:50.730 
some people like I don't really care

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:52.490 
some people like I don't really care
about<00:03:50.940> it<00:03:51.329> either<00:03:51.569> way<00:03:51.870> but<00:03:51.930> some<00:03:52.290> people

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:52.500 
about it either way but some people

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:54.650 
about it either way but some people
think<00:03:52.620> it's<00:03:52.829> useful<00:03:53.060> so<00:03:54.060> let's<00:03:54.209> back<00:03:54.329> at<00:03:54.540> it

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:54.660 
think it's useful so let's back at it

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:56.809 
think it's useful so let's back at it
there<00:03:54.959> and<00:03:55.170> moving<00:03:55.650> too<00:03:55.769> quick<00:03:56.010> settings<00:03:56.340> this

00:03:56.809 --> 00:03:56.819 
there and moving too quick settings this

00:03:56.819 --> 00:03:58.280 
there and moving too quick settings this
is<00:03:56.970> pretty<00:03:57.209> standard<00:03:57.450> everything<00:03:58.139> you<00:03:58.230> would

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:58.290 
is pretty standard everything you would

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:00.440 
is pretty standard everything you would
imagine<00:03:58.560> in<00:03:58.980> here<00:03:59.250> you<00:03:59.370> can<00:03:59.549> add<00:03:59.910> or<00:04:00.299> remove

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:00.450 
imagine in here you can add or remove

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:02.660 
imagine in here you can add or remove
them<00:04:00.989> you<00:04:01.260> can<00:04:01.410> rearrange<00:04:01.709> them<00:04:02.220> and<00:04:02.340> so<00:04:02.489> on

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:02.670 
them you can rearrange them and so on

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:04.520 
them you can rearrange them and so on

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.150 
brightness modes and things like that so

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:07.309 
brightness modes and things like that so
I'm<00:04:06.209> not<00:04:06.299> going<00:04:06.450> to<00:04:06.510> dwell<00:04:06.660> on<00:04:06.810> that<00:04:06.989> for<00:04:07.200> too

00:04:07.309 --> 00:04:07.319
