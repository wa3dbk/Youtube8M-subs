00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:06.180
 welcome to 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:08.460
 launch it 15 d 15 15 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.080
 my name is jens like rock and me 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:10.910
 I will guide you through this product launch 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.309
 accompany 

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:16.770
 the following products are presented s15 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:20.250
 de flex mount with 5 megapixel sensor 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:23.340
 module the 15 the dual mount with 5 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:25.560
 megapixel sensor module and 15 d 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:28.800
 Vandalism with 5 megapixel sensor 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:31.920
 Modules like already with the model 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.870
 v14 DE can connect two sensor modules to three 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.329
 attached to different positions 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.219
 become 

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:42.270
 which advantages offers the 5 megapixel 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:44.550
 sensor 3 megapixel image resolution for 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:48.120
 live image and storage for color and 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:50.489
 black and white sensors higher frame rates 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:53.969
 with up to 30 pictures per second in 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:56.120
 megapixel resolution a four times higher 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:58.109
 Photosensitivity for color sensors 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:59.579
 and a two times higher 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:01.530
 Photosensitivity for black and white 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:06.840
 sensors against the twelve 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:09.840
 respectively 24 models 27 better 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.549
 zoom at color sensors and 200 percent 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:15.560
 better zoom with black and white sensors 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:18.390
 compared to the twelve and 24 models 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:20.640
 regardless of the selected sensor color 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.650
 or black and white is a three megapixel 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.970
 Image resolution for live image and 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.549
 storage available 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:29.759
 this means in the black and white sensor 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:33.990
 an increase of 1 3 megapixels to 3 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:36.509
 megapixel more pictures per second 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.579
 even at high resolution by a 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:40.290
 pre-processing already in the sensor module 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:41.970
 the pictures can be faster to the 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:44.220
 actual image editing software 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.670
 transferred to the camera main board 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.979
 become 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.140
 through this mechanism we reach 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:50.630
 30 pictures per second in megapixels 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:54.090
 resolution 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:55.520
 the 5 megapixel sensor module offers one 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.710
 four times higher photosensitivity 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:01.290
 opposite the 3.1 megapixel color sensor 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:03.329
 module here on the pictures is on the 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:05.759
 right side the 5 megapixel sensor 

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:07.970
 module and on the left the 3.1 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:10.950
 megapixel sensor module pictured 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:11.970
 under the same lighting conditions that is 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.950
 picture of the 5th 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:17.990
 the pixel sensor module is much brighter 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:20.400
 than that of the 3.1 megapixel sensor module 

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:22.650
 here the light intensity continued 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:25.800
 reduced one can recognize that in the 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:28.080
 3.1 megapixel sensor module already something 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:30.180
 noise arises during the 5 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:33.540
 megapixel sensor module still a rush 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:35.760
 Price image provides the light intensity 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:37.620
 further reduced can be seen on the 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:40.080
 left side a strong picture noise 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:42.570
 which the identification of the person 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:44.490
 aggravates while at the five megapixels 

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:48.330
 Sensor module only a slight noise 

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:52.680
 can be recognized by the 5 megapixels 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:54.959
 Sensorics creates a 27 larger 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:58.260
 zoom factor with color sensors opposite 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:03:00.240
 the 3.1 megapixel color sensors 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:02.959
 We reach black-and-white sensors 

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:05.790
 even a zoom factor larger by 200 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:06.680
 opposite the 1 3 megapixel black and white 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:09.209
 sensor 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:11.750
 This allows the camera to be further away 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:14.670
 be mounted by the protected object 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:19.110
 which provides greater flexibility 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:21.570
 the planning and installation allows the 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:24.600
 5 megapixel sensor has slightly smaller 

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:26.940
 Measure as the 3.1 or 1.3 megapixel 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:29.010
 sensor results in something 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:31.260
 smaller picture angle as you can on this 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:32.880
 images can be seen on the poster 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:35.250
 But this also becomes a reality 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:39.480
 shown larger which is a better 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:41.250
 Detailed accuracy allows here 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:43.920
 I briefly explain why the 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:46.140
 Image angle changed by the lens 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:48.570
 a picture is generated on the sensor 

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:51.570
 and the complete sensor will 

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:53.940
 exploited accordingly since the 5th 

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:55.080
 megapixel sensor is slightly smaller 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:57.350
 accordingly a smaller one 

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:59.420
 Image section projected on the sensor 

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:01.799
 By changing the sensor size 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:04.680
 then, of course, it changes too 

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:07.350
 Picture angle accordingly we fit 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:08.670
 our objective table and this on 

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:10.680
 to show an example 

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:14.730
 we look at the left side the 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:17.760
 l22 lens at 3.1 megapixel which 

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:20.970
 with the 5 megapixel sensor to an 11 

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:25.200
 25 becomes objectively that is the 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:26.610
 focal length changes from 22 mm to 25 

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:29.940
 which is in a horizontal 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:33.570
 Image angle change from 90 degrees to 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:37.430
 82 degrees shows on the right side 

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:42.600
 Let's see the telephoto lens with 1135 

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:45.900
 3.1 megapixels and 1160 at 5 megapixels 

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:47.910
 The focal length changes from 135 mm 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:51.510
 on 160 mm 

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:53.490
 the picture angle from 15 degrees to 13 degrees 

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:56.780
 This will allow more 

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:59.390
 Detect details in greater distance 

00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:02.400
 the most important facts at a glance 

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:06.320
 the hemisphere models ass 15 um and 

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:09.120
 s15 de are available from july 2013 

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:12.320
 the hemisphere models s 14 m and the 

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:15.690
 vcd are still available 

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:17.310
 the new 5 megapixel sensors are only 

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:18.590
 with the newly introduced models 

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:22.140
 compatible 

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:26.850
 s14 sensor modules can not handle ass 15 

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:28.140
 Models are used many thanks 

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:30.030
 for your attention 

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:32.510
 I hope you liked it until the 

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:32.510
 next time
