warfare<00:01:36.109> 2<00:01:36.499> was<00:01:36.740> so<00:01:37.069> i<00:01:37.279> bet<00:01:38.060> that<00:01:38.240> they're<00:01:38.420> not

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:38.659 
warfare 2 was so i bet that they're not

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:40.719 
warfare 2 was so i bet that they're not
going<00:01:39.049> to<00:01:39.170> be<00:01:39.529> putting<00:01:40.099> those<00:01:40.279> insanely

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:40.729 
going to be putting those insanely

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:42.219 
going to be putting those insanely
powered<00:01:41.270> new<00:01:41.479> tubes<00:01:41.719> in<00:01:41.869> the<00:01:41.929> game<00:01:42.109> anymore

00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:42.229 
powered new tubes in the game anymore

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:43.660 
powered new tubes in the game anymore
they're<00:01:42.619> probably<00:01:42.889> going<00:01:43.130> to<00:01:43.219> exhale<00:01:43.429> them

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:43.670 
they're probably going to exhale them

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:45.309 
they're probably going to exhale them
back<00:01:43.880> a<00:01:43.909> little<00:01:44.149> bit<00:01:44.329> and<00:01:44.569> hopefully<00:01:44.899> will<00:01:45.229> be

00:01:45.309 --> 00:01:45.319 
back a little bit and hopefully will be

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:46.690 
back a little bit and hopefully will be
a<00:01:45.349> little<00:01:45.590> bit<00:01:45.740> more<00:01:45.889> like<00:01:46.099> world<00:01:46.369> at<00:01:46.490> war<00:01:46.670> or

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:46.700 
a little bit more like world at war or

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:48.219 
a little bit more like world at war or
black<00:01:47.119> ops<00:01:47.359> 2<00:01:47.569> where<00:01:47.689> they're<00:01:47.810> not<00:01:47.959> very

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:48.229 
black ops 2 where they're not very

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:50.589 
black ops 2 where they're not very
useful<00:01:48.469> now<00:01:49.459> this<00:01:49.579> next<00:01:49.729> one<00:01:49.969> oh<00:01:50.060> this<00:01:50.270> just

00:01:50.589 --> 00:01:50.599 
useful now this next one oh this just

00:01:50.599 --> 00:01:52.419 
useful now this next one oh this just
kind<00:01:50.749> of<00:01:50.840> goes<00:01:51.049> along<00:01:51.169> with<00:01:51.409> that<00:01:51.469> balancing

00:01:52.419 --> 00:01:52.429 
kind of goes along with that balancing

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:54.459 
kind of goes along with that balancing

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:49.100 
stopping power is what makes Cod

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:51.610 
stopping power is what makes Cod
fast-paced<00:02:49.730> and<00:02:49.970> it<00:02:50.180> does<00:02:50.390> and<00:02:50.690> he<00:02:51.200> replies

stopping<00:02:52.520> power<00:02:52.640> is<00:02:52.850> not<00:02:53.030> what<00:02:53.240> makes<00:02:53.480> modern

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:53.840 
stopping power is not what makes modern

warfare<00:02:53.990> fast<00:02:54.350> paced<00:02:54.680> weapon<00:02:55.430> damage<00:02:55.640> does

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:56.060 
warfare fast paced weapon damage does

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:57.790 
warfare fast paced weapon damage does
that<00:02:56.300> it<00:02:56.480> can<00:02:56.720> be<00:02:56.810> fast<00:02:57.080> without<00:02:57.320> a<00:02:57.500> single

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:57.800 
that it can be fast without a single

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:00.130 
that it can be fast without a single
perk<00:02:58.130> so<00:02:58.970> what<00:02:59.120> that<00:02:59.150> means<00:02:59.450> is<00:02:59.600> is<00:02:59.810> there's

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:00.140 
perk so what that means is is there's

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:01.660 
perk so what that means is is there's
not<00:03:00.290> going<00:03:00.410> to<00:03:00.470> be<00:03:00.560> stopping<00:03:01.010> power<00:03:01.190> but<00:03:01.580> at

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:02.980 
not going to be stopping power but at
the<00:03:01.790> same<00:03:01.970> time<00:03:02.180> they're<00:03:02.450> probably<00:03:02.720> going<00:03:02.900> to

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:02.990 
the same time they're probably going to

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:04.810 
the same time they're probably going to
up<00:03:03.200> the<00:03:03.410> damage<00:03:03.650> on<00:03:03.950> the<00:03:04.040> weapons<00:03:04.430> so<00:03:04.700> the

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:04.820 
up the damage on the weapons so the

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:06.340 
up the damage on the weapons so the
weapons<00:03:05.150> are<00:03:05.210> going<00:03:05.330> to<00:03:05.390> kill<00:03:05.630> faster<00:03:05.870> the

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:06.350 
weapons are going to kill faster the

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:07.690 
weapons are going to kill faster the
bullets<00:03:06.650> are<00:03:06.710> going<00:03:06.860> to<00:03:06.920> be<00:03:07.010> stronger<00:03:07.430> and

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:07.700 
bullets are going to be stronger and

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:09.460 
bullets are going to be stronger and
there's<00:03:08.150> it's<00:03:08.390> just<00:03:08.600> like<00:03:08.720> having<00:03:08.870> stopping

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:09.470 
there's it's just like having stopping

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:10.870 
there's it's just like having stopping
power<00:03:09.620> built<00:03:10.070> into<00:03:10.460> the<00:03:10.580> game<00:03:10.730> without

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:10.880 
power built into the game without

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:12.640 
power built into the game without
actually<00:03:11.360> happening<00:03:11.600> to<00:03:11.780> waste<00:03:12.080> the<00:03:12.260> perk<00:03:12.470> on

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:12.650 
actually happening to waste the perk on

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:14.410 
actually happening to waste the perk on
it<00:03:12.800> and<00:03:12.950> that's<00:03:13.370> awesome<00:03:13.700> because<00:03:13.820> now<00:03:14.120> we<00:03:14.180> can

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:14.420 
it and that's awesome because now we can

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:16.420 
it and that's awesome because now we can
mess<00:03:14.630> around<00:03:14.660> with<00:03:15.080> those<00:03:15.230> second<00:03:15.560> perks<00:03:15.800> even

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:16.430 
mess around with those second perks even

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:18.010 
mess around with those second perks even
though<00:03:16.550> it<00:03:16.640> might<00:03:16.760> end<00:03:16.820> up<00:03:17.120> like<00:03:17.360> black<00:03:17.570> ops<00:03:17.810> 2

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:18.020 
though it might end up like black ops 2

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:19.720 
though it might end up like black ops 2
where<00:03:18.230> there's<00:03:18.620> no<00:03:18.740> stopping<00:03:19.130> power<00:03:19.250> so<00:03:19.550> just

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:19.730 
where there's no stopping power so just

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:23.050 
where there's no stopping power so just
you<00:03:19.910> slide<00:03:20.210> a<00:03:20.240> hand<00:03:20.330> all<00:03:20.630> the<00:03:20.720> time<00:03:21.910> now<00:03:22.910> this

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:23.060 
you slide a hand all the time now this

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:24.880 
you slide a hand all the time now this
next<00:03:23.210> one<00:03:23.420> says<00:03:23.630> incorrect<00:03:24.350> it<00:03:24.650> will<00:03:24.770> be

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:24.890 
next one says incorrect it will be

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:27.310 
next one says incorrect it will be
