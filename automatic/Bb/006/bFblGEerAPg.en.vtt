great I mean we both appreciate that but
I<00:00:29.510> mean<00:00:29.660> I<00:00:29.720> think<00:00:29.830> realistically<00:00:34.719> which<00:00:35.719> one

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:35.870 
I mean I think realistically which one

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:37.509

you<00:00:35.989> want<00:00:36.139> but<00:00:36.440> I<00:00:36.649> think<00:00:36.679> it's<00:00:36.949> like<00:00:37.129> a<00:00:37.159> buffet

00:00:37.509 --> 00:00:37.519 
you want but I think it's like a buffet

you want but I think it's like a buffet
right<00:00:37.699> we<00:00:38.059> gotta<00:00:38.269> just<00:00:38.479> pick<00:00:38.690> and<00:00:38.870> choose<00:00:38.899> and

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:39.319 
right we gotta just pick and choose and

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:49.069 
right we gotta just pick and choose and
take<00:00:39.469> it<00:00:39.589> out

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079
