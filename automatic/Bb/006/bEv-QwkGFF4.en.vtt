00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:12.070
 hello friends welcome to the orchard in 

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:14.800
 house on this occasion we are going to collect 

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:17.050
 something different but very necessary for 

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:19.150
 our crops the seeds of 

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:21.520
 our plants to ensure that 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:24.150
 we will have harvest after harvest, not what 

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:24.150
 you can lose 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.900
 There are many inquiries we receive 

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:33.480
 on facebook about how we can get 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.520
 those seeds from which they will sprout 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.260
 those magnificent fruits in this case 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:40.010
 let's work with some of those that 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:42.840
 we have already started because of the time 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:44.820
 this plant that I have laid down so that 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.879
 they were drying but as is still 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:50.460
 is in the land of the garden is a 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:53.010
 Mallorca long radish plant and 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.980
 you saw how big they came out and delicious 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:58.710
 well in this case we have a seed 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:01.200
 in pod would work as in many 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.750
 legumes next as the ies as much as 

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:06.840
 you see we have 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:09.090
 the pods these would be some pods 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.970
 dry others are still a bit green 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.620
 and inside this pod that is where it 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.020
 find the seeds 

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:18.000
 the seeds that we have to collect 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.550
 and save so that next year 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.590
 we can have again because we can 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:24.360
 I explain this because not all plants 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:27.390
 They work the same when it comes to collecting 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:29.340
 its seeds in this case the plant them 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.080
 we teach the flowers through photos 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.580
 of facebook and we even ask to see 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:36.010
 If I knew which plant it was 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:38.170
 and makes the flower in this area here the 

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:40.570
 inflorescences and then generates this 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:43.180
 pod is not the seed inside the 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:45.130
 flower is important to know for the 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:46.840
 time to collect these seeds now not 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:48.670
 we have to go find them in the case 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:50.500
 for example of tomatoes you all know 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:52.990
 that the seeds are inside the fruit 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:54.940
 is another operation different from that of 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:57.640
 raval if it always comes later then we 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:59.830
 let the issue of the lettuce 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:02.200
 readings will not generate a pod in 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:04.420
 which we will collect the seed but 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:06.130
 that will be inside the flower itself at 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:08.200
 same as happens for example with plants 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:10.390
 ornamental but friends of the garden as 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:12.400
 the card that we explained to you that there was 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:14.050
 to open the flower and there they were inside 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:15.880
 the seeds that we will connect 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:18.100
 this case I can only teach you the 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:20.380
 flowers because they have not germinated yet 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:22.870
 As you can see, they have to 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:25.570
 finish opening and start to dry 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:28.330
 to be able to pick up this seed another 

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:32.190
 case of plant with pod would be that of the 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:32.190
 arugula and right now I explain it 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:40.840
 although you see it, they are at this plant 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:42.580
 Arugula has given me delicious leaves to 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:44.140
 the salads and now the 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:46.540
 time to collect your seeds 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:49.480
 to get again these magnificent 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:51.459
 You set your sheets and I told you before 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:54.220
 there are pods here again 

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:56.800
 we can see the flower is still dry 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:58.690
 the inflorescence and how it has been doing 

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:00.910
 by we would do the same as with the 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:04.570
 radish we take the pod this case 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:06.910
 much smaller and the open 

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:08.860
 we take out the seeds the seeds 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:10.959
 simply in my case I return them to 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:13.330
 put in the same pot and cut 

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:15.730
 totally the plant so that I go 

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:18.100
 sprouting and it's fix this plus here already 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:20.560
 I have a small plant Arugula is 

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:22.690
 starting to sprout this other is a 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:24.250
 Jewish remember that he always planted 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:25.950
 beans to give nitrogen to the 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:27.950
 plants 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:27.950
 Y 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:36.129
 in this case the plant or kill it better 

00:03:33.159 --> 00:03:38.049
 said radishes bothers me if I have to 

00:03:36.129 --> 00:03:39.700
 leave and wait for it to dry in these 

00:03:38.049 --> 00:03:41.500
 pods we could comment in part if 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:43.810
 they're dry so what I'm going to do 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:46.769
 converge using this space is to cut the 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:46.769
 plant that I had already worked 

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:52.920
 and leave it in the sun to dry 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:55.200
 after collecting the rest of 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:58.590
 seeds also remember that we have 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:04:00.360
 that pluck root ball for 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:03.300
 to be able to continue using our land 

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:05.670
 of cultivation these seeds once dry 

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:08.040
 once we have opened them we can 

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:10.530
 keep them in bags that we can 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:13.200
 prepare simply with baking paper 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:15.450
 this waxed paper we put them and 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:17.370
 we place the name and date very well 

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:20.609
 in which we collected the 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:22.950
 Seeds vary in life span of 

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:25.350
 some species to others but the average is 

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:27.390
 between 2 and 3 years have to 

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:28.740
 be well guarded in the shade and not 

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:31.140
 can give them the heat because then 

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:32.940
 could germinate or break down so 

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:35.250
 for example in a metal tin is what 

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:36.840
 Ideal, I hope you liked it 

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:39.030
 keep in touch with us through 

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:41.690
 of facebook and not later lose the 

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:41.690
 next chapter
