to the center again the same thing only

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:15.680 
to the center again the same thing only
this<00:02:14.459> is<00:02:14.640> going<00:02:14.760> to<00:02:14.819> make<00:02:14.940> a<00:02:15.000> little<00:02:15.569> bit

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
this is going to make a little bit

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:24.220 
this is going to make a little bit
tighter<00:02:16.099> like<00:02:17.099> that<00:02:19.670> okay<00:02:20.670> into<00:02:21.420> the<00:02:21.540> fold<00:02:21.840> and

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:24.230 
tighter like that okay into the fold and

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:26.690 
tighter like that okay into the fold and
once<00:02:25.230> again<00:02:25.379> on<00:02:25.590> this<00:02:25.769> side<00:02:26.040> fold<00:02:26.370> to<00:02:26.580> the

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
once again on this side fold to the

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:28.970 
once again on this side fold to the
center<00:02:26.940> just<00:02:27.299> gonna<00:02:27.989> make<00:02:28.110> a<00:02:28.140> neater<00:02:28.560> little

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
center just gonna make a neater little

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:34.880 
center just gonna make a neater little
point<00:02:29.310> to<00:02:29.580> it<00:02:30.890> folds<00:02:31.890> this<00:02:32.160> air<00:02:33.560> so<00:02:34.560> this<00:02:34.739> is

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
point to it folds this air so this is

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:37.660 
point to it folds this air so this is
what<00:02:35.069> it<00:02:35.190> looks<00:02:35.430> like

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:37.670 
what it looks like

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:42.380 
what it looks like
on<00:02:38.670> the<00:02:38.819> other<00:02:38.910> side<00:02:40.519> okay<00:02:41.519> so<00:02:41.849> now<00:02:42.090> we're

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
on the other side okay so now we're

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:46.069 
on the other side okay so now we're
gonna<00:02:42.510> flip<00:02:42.870> it<00:02:43.140> over<00:02:43.970> and<00:02:44.970> if<00:02:45.690> you've<00:02:45.870> done<00:02:46.049> it

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:46.079 
gonna flip it over and if you've done it

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:47.240 
gonna flip it over and if you've done it
right<00:02:46.290> you<00:02:46.349> should<00:02:46.590> have<00:02:46.620> a<00:02:46.739> little<00:02:46.980> pyramid

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
right you should have a little pyramid

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:49.789 
right you should have a little pyramid
down<00:02:47.549> there<00:02:48.110> and<00:02:49.110> you're<00:02:49.230> going<00:02:49.319> to<00:02:49.410> take<00:02:49.620> the

00:02:49.789 --> 00:02:49.799 
down there and you're going to take the

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:52.250 
down there and you're going to take the
end<00:02:50.010> and<00:02:50.670> when<00:02:50.940> you're<00:02:51.030> going<00:02:51.150> to<00:02:51.269> fold<00:02:51.569> it<00:02:51.810> up

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
end and when you're going to fold it up

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:59.300 
end and when you're going to fold it up
and<00:02:52.709> under<00:02:54.019> this<00:02:55.019> little<00:02:55.260> flop<00:02:57.560> there<00:02:58.560> you<00:02:58.829> go

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
and under this little flop there you go

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:02.720 
and under this little flop there you go
and<00:03:00.260> then<00:03:01.260> you're<00:03:01.859> going<00:03:01.980> to<00:03:02.069> fold<00:03:02.400> it<00:03:02.549> in<00:03:02.700> half

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
and then you're going to fold it in half

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:05.240 
and then you're going to fold it in half
again<00:03:03.120> the<00:03:03.540> same<00:03:03.780> way<00:03:04.049> up<00:03:04.319> and<00:03:04.560> under<00:03:05.099> this

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
again the same way up and under this

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:09.830 
again the same way up and under this
little<00:03:05.459> flap<00:03:07.670> now<00:03:08.670> make<00:03:08.880> sure<00:03:08.910> you<00:03:09.450> don't<00:03:09.630> pull

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840 
little flap now make sure you don't pull

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:12.979 
little flap now make sure you don't pull
up<00:03:09.870> too<00:03:10.200> tight<00:03:10.440> so<00:03:10.799> that<00:03:11.459> you<00:03:11.760> don't<00:03:11.970> get<00:03:12.329> you

00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:12.989 
up too tight so that you don't get you

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:16.339 
up too tight so that you don't get you
don't<00:03:13.019> want<00:03:13.290> to<00:03:13.380> tear<00:03:14.010> it<00:03:14.040> and<00:03:15.019> then<00:03:16.019> you

00:03:16.339 --> 00:03:16.349 
don't want to tear it and then you

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:18.740 
don't want to tear it and then you
crease<00:03:16.620> again<00:03:16.799> and<00:03:17.480> then<00:03:18.480> you're<00:03:18.599> going<00:03:18.690> to

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750 
crease again and then you're going to

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:22.309 
crease again and then you're going to
fold<00:03:18.959> it<00:03:19.109> one<00:03:19.380> more<00:03:19.620> time<00:03:19.889> the<00:03:20.160> same<00:03:20.459> way<00:03:20.900> up<00:03:21.900> to

00:03:22.309 --> 00:03:22.319 
fold it one more time the same way up to

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:27.470 
fold it one more time the same way up to
that<00:03:24.290> okay<00:03:25.290> and<00:03:25.519> this<00:03:26.519> is<00:03:26.910> what<00:03:27.150> it<00:03:27.269> should

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 
that okay and this is what it should

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:30.920 
that okay and this is what it should
look<00:03:27.510> like<00:03:27.660> and<00:03:28.669> you<00:03:29.669> kind<00:03:29.910> of<00:03:30.000> bend<00:03:30.630> it<00:03:30.840> a

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930 
look like and you kind of bend it a

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:34.339 
look like and you kind of bend it a
little<00:03:31.169> bit<00:03:31.410> hope<00:03:32.209> for<00:03:33.209> later<00:03:33.450> okay<00:03:33.780> what

00:03:34.339 --> 00:03:34.349 
little bit hope for later okay what

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:35.390 
little bit hope for later okay what
you're<00:03:34.440> going<00:03:34.620> to<00:03:34.650> do<00:03:34.769> now<00:03:34.919> is<00:03:35.069> you<00:03:35.190> can<00:03:35.220> do

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.400 
you're going to do now is you can do

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:38.000 
you're going to do now is you can do
five<00:03:35.849> of<00:03:35.910> these<00:03:36.150> so<00:03:36.690> rewind<00:03:37.530> back<00:03:37.739> to<00:03:37.799> the

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:38.010 
five of these so rewind back to the

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:40.879 
five of these so rewind back to the
beginning<00:03:38.310> of<00:03:38.400> this<00:03:38.549> video<00:03:38.910> and<00:03:39.590> do<00:03:40.590> it<00:03:40.709> again

00:03:40.879 --> 00:03:40.889 
beginning of this video and do it again

00:03:40.889 --> 00:03:46.490 
beginning of this video and do it again
four<00:03:41.489> more<00:03:41.730> times<00:03:43.940> okay<00:03:44.940> now<00:03:45.540> that<00:03:45.750> you<00:03:45.900> have

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:46.500 
four more times okay now that you have

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:49.250 
four more times okay now that you have
all<00:03:46.799> five<00:03:47.190> pieces<00:03:47.549> done<00:03:48.060> and<00:03:48.599> we're<00:03:48.989> going<00:03:49.169> to

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:49.260 
all five pieces done and we're going to

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.589 
all five pieces done and we're going to
put<00:03:49.380> them<00:03:49.500> together<00:03:49.709> now<00:03:50.130> and<00:03:50.459> this<00:03:50.970> is<00:03:51.150> why

00:03:51.589 --> 00:03:51.599 
put them together now and this is why

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:54.199 
put them together now and this is why
it's<00:03:51.780> called<00:03:51.930> modular<00:03:52.639> origami<00:03:53.639> because

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:54.209 
it's called modular origami because

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:56.150 
it's called modular origami because
you're<00:03:54.419> putting<00:03:54.540> five<00:03:54.930> pieces<00:03:55.260> together<00:03:55.709> and

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:56.160 
you're putting five pieces together and

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:58.339 
you're putting five pieces together and
front<00:03:56.579> they're<00:03:56.730> called<00:03:56.910> modules<00:03:57.419> so<00:03:58.169> what<00:03:58.319> I

00:03:58.339 --> 00:03:58.349 
front they're called modules so what I

00:03:58.349 --> 00:04:01.280 
front they're called modules so what I
always<00:03:58.620> do<00:03:58.980> is<00:03:59.250> I<00:03:59.579> start<00:04:00.329> with<00:04:00.389> the<00:04:00.660> back<00:04:00.810> first

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:01.290 
always do is I start with the back first

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:03.559 
always do is I start with the back first
on<00:04:01.739> the<00:04:02.099> back<00:04:02.280> you'll<00:04:02.459> see<00:04:02.639> two<00:04:02.879> little<00:04:03.269> flaps

00:04:03.559 --> 00:04:03.569 
on the back you'll see two little flaps

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:06.740 
on the back you'll see two little flaps
right<00:04:04.049> there<00:04:04.290> one<00:04:04.530> two<00:04:05.120> I<00:04:06.120> always<00:04:06.419> put<00:04:06.629> my

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:06.750 
right there one two I always put my

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:10.630 
right there one two I always put my
right<00:04:07.079> into<00:04:08.040> the<00:04:08.190> back<00:04:08.430> and<00:04:09.139> then

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:10.640 
right into the back and then

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:14.530 
right into the back and then
on<00:04:10.760> the<00:04:11.180> front<00:04:11.540> you<00:04:11.780> put<00:04:12.020> this<00:04:12.230> left<00:04:13.540> into

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:14.540 
on the front you put this left into

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:16.479 
on the front you put this left into
under<00:04:15.020> here<00:04:15.410> be<00:04:15.950> careful<00:04:16.130> when<00:04:16.370> you're

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:16.489 
under here be careful when you're

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:18.130 
under here be careful when you're
lifting<00:04:16.700> it<00:04:17.030> once<00:04:17.299> again<00:04:17.420> make<00:04:17.750> sure<00:04:17.780> you

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:18.140 
lifting it once again make sure you

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:21.880 
lifting it once again make sure you
don't<00:04:18.380> rip<00:04:19.130> it's<00:04:19.430> pretty<00:04:19.700> strong<00:04:20.030> though<00:04:20.890> okay

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:21.890 
don't rip it's pretty strong though okay

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:23.830 
don't rip it's pretty strong though okay
so<00:04:22.640> then<00:04:22.790> let's<00:04:22.820> grab<00:04:23.270> another<00:04:23.600> piece

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:23.840 
so then let's grab another piece

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:27.840 
so then let's grab another piece
actually<00:04:24.170> look<00:04:24.950> around<00:04:25.100> this<00:04:25.370> way<00:04:25.550> and<00:04:26.530> I

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:27.850 
actually look around this way and I

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:30.490 
actually look around this way and I
start<00:04:28.850> with<00:04:28.940> the<00:04:29.060> back<00:04:29.240> so<00:04:29.570> I<00:04:29.630> put<00:04:29.810> this<00:04:30.110> left

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:30.500 
start with the back so I put this left

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:36.340 
start with the back so I put this left
in<00:04:30.860> the<00:04:31.820> back<00:04:33.820> in<00:04:34.820> the<00:04:34.880> back<00:04:35.120> flap<00:04:35.450> flip<00:04:36.170> it
