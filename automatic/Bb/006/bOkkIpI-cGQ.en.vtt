00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:12.990
 Let's meet a giant of the world of 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:14.700
 sony xperia t2 ultra dual smartphone 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.710
 He is very old with a screen of 6 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.660
 inches and has a configurable 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.520
 to meet the majority of users 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.560
 he is also one of the first models to 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:30.330
 debut the case in the six inches between 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:32.460
 smartphones not factory the other side t2 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.230
 Much remembers to undress and ultra that 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.809
 we analyze here but without the same 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.370
 glass finish aluminum board a 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:40.230
 construction is entirely made of 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.960
 plastic and although it has 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.760
 simple is not enough to be ugly the screen of 6 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.200
 inch makes it a great model 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.000
 sufficient to cause some 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.440
 inconveniences since it does not fit in the pocket 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.090
 of some pants 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.370
 this is a common problem for those who choose 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:56.190
 for a smartphone with such a big screen 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:58.039
 Why talk on screen has hd resolution? 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.930
 results in a pixel density of 

00:00:58.039 --> 00:01:02.309
 245 dots per inch and there are already 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.549
 known breeding technologies 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:07.170
 of the sony screen as a trillo - and bravia 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:09.510
 mobile and 2 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.610
 this makes the t2 an auger to have 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:14.520
 a color quality that is between a 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:17.390
 xperia z1 and another but with a resolution 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.390
 much smaller 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:25.260
 the xperia t2 processor on the other side is 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:27.660
 a version slightly or see placed 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:31.590
 of the four-core snapdragon 400 

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:34.440
 running at 1.4 ghz 1 gb of ram and 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:36.990
 adriano 305 graphics is a configuration 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:38.460
 slightly better than the engine g but 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.830
 taking into account that the sony 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.900
 uses the time escape interface ue by 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:44.310
 top of android the overall performance is 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:46.350
 basically the same 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.300
 the user hardly feels the lack of 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.250
 performance on most tasks and 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:52.920
 seven very heavy games 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.570
 the factory android is the 4.3 of l min 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:58.229
 but the update to the latest version 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:02:00.180
 4.4 qat has already been confirmed by sony 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:01.920
 we consider it a failure he does not travel 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:05.510
 with the last version since it was 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.510
 announced in 2013 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:13.110
 the quality of the rear camera of 3 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:15.180
 megapixels is surprisingly good 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:17.520
 whereas we have in hand a model 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:18.810
 intermediate it is lower than the 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:21.930
 which equip the most advanced models 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:24.390
 as you would expect not filming in 4k 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:26.850
 nor bringing the more than 20 megapixels 12 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:29.250
 years and 2 but is able to take good pictures 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:31.680
 record videos without major glitches 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:35.610
 possibility of using everyone in 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:37.769
 results in photos of 3920 by 2204 or 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:40.950
 use the high top- pull mode 

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:42.330
 8.6 megapixel photos with hdr com 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:44.160
 very good quality 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:47.519
 basically the same options at the time of 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:49.260
 can choose between 1080p and 30 

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:51.720
 frames per second, which results in a 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:55.380
 average quality but with greater fluidity or 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:57.540
 1080p at 24 frames per second with hdr 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:59.790
 which automates a number of functions and 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:02.040
 lets the final video more vividly the 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:03.900
 camera software is the same as z2 so 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:06.630
 as the front camera while providing 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:09.390
 only 1.1 megapixels and records videos in 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:12.290
 720p results in a final quality only 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:12.290
 slightly lower 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:18.330
 something that is becoming standard in the 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:20.580
 sony models even middlemen 

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:21.600
 as t2 other is the presence of batteries 

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:23.700
 massive 

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:26.310
 we have one with capacity of 3 thousand 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:27.750
 enough women for up to one day and 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:29.460
 heavy duty medium 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:31.920
 it has a good management of 

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:34.890
 sony energy but unfortunately it is not 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:36.720
 removable as internal storage t2 

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:39.630
 another does not or does not escape its category 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:42.330
 Bringing 8GB Card Support 

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:44.220
 micro sd of up to 32 gigabytes 

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:46.500
 enough to meet most of the 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:49.380
 users in the extras we miss 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:51.480
 a 4g connection that was abandoned to 

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:54.360
 give preference to support for two chips 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:58.200
 of which one is supposed to connect 3g 

00:03:54.360 --> 00:04:01.500
 for rest we have nfc pps with gps and caps 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:07.230
 fm radio with rds wifi dual band us 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:14.730
 abgn bluetooth 4.0 dna and mh standards 

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:16.770
 he found the sony xperia t2 ultra 

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:18.209
 donated for an average price of 1,200 reais 

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:20.070
 worth it 

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:22.020
 well he is one of the few models that 

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:24.270
 bring such a big screen since it is a 

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:26.280
 relatively new segment 

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:28.350
 comparing both datasheet and 

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:30.540
 it's a bit pricey so 

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:32.850
 already offers cheaper options and 

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:34.560
 better than the Edson bike, even though it 

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:37.110
 come with the main attraction of t2 

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:39.180
 Ultra Your 6 Inch Screen 

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:41.100
 if you liked short on low so our 

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:43.730
 youtube channel every day has video 

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:43.730
 new to you
