 I went to make a football match 

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:11.659
 the wolf in the lot in the corridors on the bottom of italy 

00:00:12.419 --> 00:00:14.729
 and there I bought myself on credit

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:21.820
 loved cameras and personal belongings 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:24.439

00:00:28.449 --> 00:00:30.859

 work comfort save time for this exceptional 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:50.440
 this year marks the 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:53.880
 and then you can transmit your images in any conditions 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.650
 all you need is a laptop 

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:02.580
 to plug your laptop back into your computer you have everything from 

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:03.970
 following the line 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:06.970
 of the press organ for which you work 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.930
 in a few moments for the photo is paris or london or elsewhere 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:17.330

00:01:17.329 --> 00:01:21.659
 still the case the star match was always held around 10 am to 12 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:22.780
 hours and a half

 don quixote the newspaper was waiting to buckle 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:30.650

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:34.610
 we were still in Argentina needed to provide 20 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:37.469
 in a locker room in the laboratory 

00:01:37.469 --> 00:01:39.620
 so that we can transmit AIDS 

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:40.880
 we were 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:44.990
 to a transmission because we called happiness 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:47.680
 and it was asking because 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:50.680
 in the lab but they fired a test 

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.710
 positive on his magpie 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:56.880

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:13.149
 e receipt in the newspaper for whom you collaborate cool agency missed at 

00:02:13.149 --> 00:02:14.349

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:17.349
 so all that was fine 

00:02:24.499 --> 00:02:27.769
 it was a revolution because it brought us working comfort 

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:30.409

00:02:38.679 --> 00:02:40.189
 refractory to the idea 

00:02:40.189 --> 00:02:43.809

00:02:43.809 --> 00:02:45.389
 see digital devices 

00:02:45.389 --> 00:02:49.919
 ah yes it takes to participate there is a time lag on the solid margins 

00:02:51.039 --> 00:02:53.379
