00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:08.170
 hello everyone in this video I'm going to 

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:10.030
 teach how to make a banana of gummies 

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:12.869
 for this craft I will use the 

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:16.270
 following materials 4 brown rubber bands 

00:00:12.869 --> 00:00:18.310
 15 yellow rubber bands a hook of which 

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:21.400
 They come in the bags of gummies 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:23.820
 one of crochet the one you want and for 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:27.279
 of course our two- fork loom 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:29.140
 we started the first thing I'm going to do is 

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:31.240
 take a brown rubber and I'll put it 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:34.990
 on the two ends of the right of a 

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:37.870
 fork I turn in the form of 8 I do what 

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:40.540
 go through the two ends I take another turn 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:43.900
 in the form of 8 I'll go through the two 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:45.670
 tips I give another turn in the form of 8 and 

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:48.130
 I'm going to go through both ends like that 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:49.620
 we have a total of four rubber 

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:53.219
 turns 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:55.079
 Now I take two yellow rubber bands and I'm going 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:57.420
 to put on the two ends of the right 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:59.489
 of a fork and on both ends of the 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.649
 another side of the other fork that we have left 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:04.530
 in this way 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:06.720
 I take the hook and take out the brown rubber that 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:09.720
 I have four laps over 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.940
 the yellow of the two yellow 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.580
 and we are already rolled in the two 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:17.630
 yellow in the middle 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.630
 now I'm going to catch 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:24.090
 four yellow rubber bands 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.829
 all four together and I'm going to put it in 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.500
 the two ends of the right of gift 

00:01:25.829 --> 00:01:29.780
 fork 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:32.090
 and on the two ends on the other side of the 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:35.689
 another fork 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:39.770
 well and I'm going to take out the two that I had 

00:01:35.689 --> 00:01:42.630
 below these two that were below the 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:45.329
 He passed over four 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:48.270
 on that fork and he without having reached the 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:51.390
 I take the two I had under the two 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:53.310
 rubbers and passed them over the 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.679
 four yellow gums that put now 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:59.260
 there are we are left in the middle the two 

00:01:55.679 --> 00:02:05.760
 rubbers and now I'm going to catch 

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:05.760
 four other gums as before a 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.390
 two 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:17.230
 3 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:22.100
 and 4 that we have over 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:26.370
 of the others more so 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:29.730
 and I'm going to take the four from below 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:33.810
 and taking out the 34 that I have under the 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:36.510
 pulled out above 4 that will open 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:42.010
 a fork turn around and in the fool 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:43.659
 equal fork I take the 4 rubbers from below 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:46.830
 if we keep the four 

00:02:43.659 --> 00:02:46.830
 gums that we have put now 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:51.050
 I'm going to catch 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:03:00.920
 three other yellow gums 

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:02.989
 and they take it off I'm going to put it here 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:05.150
 on the two ends of the right of this 

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:06.650
 fork and on both ends of the other 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:08.090
 side of the other fork over the 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:12.530
 others 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:13.970
 and he pulled underneath the four above 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:18.550
 of the three that I have put now of this 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:18.550
 fork and the other fork 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:26.150
 and I will put 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:27.739
 two other yellow rubber bands and in both 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:29.120
 tips on the right is the fork and the 

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:34.790
 two tips on the other side of the other 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:38.980
 fork and pulled the three from under a 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:38.980
 fork and the other loser 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:45.970
 now I'm going to catch 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:47.950
 two brown commas 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:49.780
 and I'm going to put them on both ends of 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:52.420
 the right of the two ends of the 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:57.130
 another side of the other fork 

00:03:52.420 --> 00:04:01.680
 and I take out the two yellow ones from under a 

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:01.680
 fork and the other fork 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:06.180
 and now I'm going to put a single brown gum 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:08.239
 on the two points on the right of the 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:10.880
 fork on the two ends of the other side 

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:15.440
 of the other fork 

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:18.560
 and I'm going to take out the two browns from below 

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:21.500
 of one fork and the other walk 

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:24.530
 now carefully do not let us go 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:26.210
 to remove the brown gum from a fork and 

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:28.850
 we are going to place it on the other side 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:32.129
 of the rubber on the other fork here the 

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:34.439
 two points on the left 

00:04:32.129 --> 00:04:37.580
 and we take out the part under the rubber 

00:04:34.439 --> 00:04:40.190
 above the other to make a knot 

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:43.120
 now we get out of the loom 

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:46.250
 we tighten the knot 

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:48.590
 we put the banana a little bit 

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:51.510
 a little shape 

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:54.990
 of the banana 

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:57.100
 and we would have finished it like that 

00:04:54.990 --> 00:05:00.450
 it would be 

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:00.450
 I hope you liked it
