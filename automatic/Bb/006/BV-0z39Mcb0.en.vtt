 Victorian London and Lewis Fairy Tales 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:14.219

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.220
 our mirrors are very beautifully drawn 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:25.710
 the town look for items we will be on 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:28.109
 plot locations and believe them very much and 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:31.500
 very much but openly at the beginning of the game 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:33.930
 just a few first walk on the menu 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.100
 there is an inventory with useful belongings 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.190
 your character 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.480
 collections of valuable social items 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.149
 menu friends and gifts 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.309
 and there is still a play shop with a lot 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:48.300
 cool unnecessary items truth 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:50.430
 most are not cheap with this 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.079
 figured out let's do the game mirrors 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.879
 Albion is a story game so 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.460
 Most of the tasks are written in the canvas 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:58.920
 stories here are an example of a job by means 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:03.090
 of the detective we undertake to carry out 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:05.010
 on location and look for hidden items further 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:07.530
 seeing slightly accelerated in fact all 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:09.600
 happening more slowly hidden things 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:12.570
 represented by silhouettes names 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:15.330
 or pictures here as lucky from the level 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:17.340
 their quantity also depends our task 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.920
 carry all items as quickly as possible 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:23.330
 if something is painfully well hidden 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.330
 use the tips 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:28.620
 but for example a few other 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:28.620
 locations 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:38.119
 the game is generally free but for what 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:39.829
 you can pay real money easily 

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:42.020
 converted into game gold and 

00:01:39.829 --> 00:01:44.750
 crystals and for them you can buy 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:47.149
 tips artifacts energy needed 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:49.640
 access room can be played without 

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:51.610
 Donata but the speed of the passage of the plot from 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:54.110
 this drops significantly 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:56.509
 hope and play the video you liked 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:58.280
