regular panoramic square photo video

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:22.630 
regular panoramic square photo video
slo-mo<00:00:20.869> but<00:00:21.079> now<00:00:21.200> we<00:00:21.259> have<00:00:21.560> a<00:00:21.740> new<00:00:21.949> time-lapse

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:22.640 
slo-mo but now we have a new time-lapse

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:24.249 
slo-mo but now we have a new time-lapse
mode<00:00:22.880> which<00:00:23.360> is<00:00:23.480> going<00:00:23.630> to<00:00:23.720> allow<00:00:23.810> us<00:00:24.079> to

00:00:24.249 --> 00:00:24.259 
mode which is going to allow us to

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:26.530 
mode which is going to allow us to
create<00:00:24.680> a<00:00:24.829> time-lapse<00:00:25.550> video<00:00:25.970> so<00:00:26.450> I<00:00:26.480> went

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:26.540 
create a time-lapse video so I went

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:28.209 
create a time-lapse video so I went
ahead<00:00:26.779> and<00:00:26.960> created<00:00:27.290> one<00:00:27.680> here<00:00:27.950> we'll<00:00:28.099> go

00:00:28.209 --> 00:00:28.219 
ahead and created one here we'll go

00:00:28.219 --> 00:00:29.709 
ahead and created one here we'll go
ahead<00:00:28.309> and<00:00:28.460> hit<00:00:28.610> play<00:00:28.849> and<00:00:28.939> you'll<00:00:29.210> see<00:00:29.480> the

00:00:29.709 --> 00:00:29.719 
ahead and hit play and you'll see the

00:00:29.719 --> 00:00:32.350 
ahead and hit play and you'll see the
clouds<00:00:30.110> are<00:00:30.439> moving<00:00:30.770> in<00:00:31.250> the<00:00:31.309> distance<00:00:31.910> pretty

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:32.360 
clouds are moving in the distance pretty

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:35.080 
clouds are moving in the distance pretty
quickly<00:00:32.829> in<00:00:33.829> terms<00:00:34.160> of<00:00:34.489> how<00:00:34.730> long<00:00:34.910> it<00:00:35.030> was

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:35.090 
quickly in terms of how long it was

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:36.100 
quickly in terms of how long it was
actually<00:00:35.420> out<00:00:35.540> there<00:00:35.570> was<00:00:35.750> out<00:00:35.840> there<00:00:35.960> for

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:36.110 
actually out there was out there for

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:37.959 
actually out there was out there for
about<00:00:36.230> three<00:00:36.590> minutes<00:00:36.770> and<00:00:37.190> you<00:00:37.579> can<00:00:37.700> see<00:00:37.850> the

00:00:37.959 --> 00:00:37.969 
about three minutes and you can see the

00:00:37.969 --> 00:00:41.020 
about three minutes and you can see the
clouds<00:00:38.120> are<00:00:38.480> moving<00:00:38.780> along<00:00:39.530> quite<00:00:40.219> nicely<00:00:40.280> and

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:41.030 
clouds are moving along quite nicely and

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:43.569 
clouds are moving along quite nicely and
sort<00:00:41.239> of<00:00:41.300> giving<00:00:41.539> that<00:00:41.690> time<00:00:41.960> lapse<00:00:42.260> feel<00:00:42.589> next

00:00:43.569 --> 00:00:43.579 
sort of giving that time lapse feel next

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:45.040 
sort of giving that time lapse feel next
up<00:00:43.670> let's<00:00:43.820> take<00:00:44.059> a<00:00:44.089> quick<00:00:44.390> look<00:00:44.629> at<00:00:44.839> some<00:00:44.870> of

these shadows we can actually go across
here<00:01:08.200> select<00:01:09.200> shadows<00:01:09.680> and<00:01:10.010> then<00:01:10.220> just<00:01:10.520> sort

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:10.700 
here select shadows and then just sort

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:12.280 
here select shadows and then just sort
of<00:01:10.790> move<00:01:10.970> that<00:01:11.150> around<00:01:11.299> again<00:01:11.810> we<00:01:11.930> can<00:01:12.049> go<00:01:12.140> back

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:12.290 
of move that around again we can go back

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:14.710 
of move that around again we can go back
into<00:01:12.530> it<00:01:12.830> play<00:01:13.100> with<00:01:13.130> the<00:01:13.370> exposure<00:01:13.880> bring

back some light we can go back into it
again<00:01:17.180> here<00:01:17.870> and<00:01:18.020> we<00:01:18.860> can<00:01:19.010> go<00:01:19.130> to<00:01:19.190> the<00:01:19.490> color

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:19.760 
again here and we can go to the color

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:21.460 
again here and we can go to the color
section<00:01:20.090> which<00:01:20.420> will<00:01:20.570> show<00:01:20.780> you<00:01:20.840> the<00:01:21.170> color

up sort of emphasizing more colors and

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:27.160 
up sort of emphasizing more colors and
then<00:01:25.520> again<00:01:25.760> tapping<00:01:26.240> over<00:01:26.600> there<00:01:26.780> will<00:01:26.960> bring

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:27.170 
then again tapping over there will bring

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:28.630 
then again tapping over there will bring
up<00:01:27.290> some<00:01:27.470> more<00:01:27.650> features<00:01:28.010> within<00:01:28.250> the<00:01:28.430> color

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:28.640 
up some more features within the color

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:30.220 
up some more features within the color
so<00:01:28.850> if<00:01:28.940> you<00:01:29.000> want<00:01:29.150> it<00:01:29.210> to<00:01:29.300> change<00:01:29.330> the<00:01:29.690> vibrancy
