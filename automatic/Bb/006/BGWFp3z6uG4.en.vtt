00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:07.990
 all dads and especially all 

00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:09.759
 dads gamers with their kids gamers and 

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:12.129
 we go with what we are going to 

00:00:09.759 --> 00:00:14.349
 the news satoru iwata recognizes no 

00:00:12.129 --> 00:00:16.030
 be satisfied with the current situation 

00:00:14.349 --> 00:00:17.800
 of wii and well they are some 

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:20.590
 statements that the truth is that they are going to 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:22.330
 form a lot of controversy because that the 

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:24.520
 own president of nintendo what 

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:26.440
 recognize in this way so clearly the 

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:29.530
 it's true that it's good 

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:31.270
 some attentive opinions because satoru 

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:33.610
 iwata has spoken in an interview with 

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:35.770
 the time magazine about the current state 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:37.690
 of the nintendo consoles and has left 

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:39.850
 a headline that will go around the 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:42.460
 world during this day precisely today 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:44.770
 father's day has said the father of 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:48.010
 wii one one of the parents of wii one has 

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:50.590
 said that the performance of wiiu in what 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:52.540
 commercial is not what they expect they are 

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:55.090
 somewhat disappointed with your console 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:57.100
 after dinner and if we add his 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:59.350
 recent announcement of a new console 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:01.750
 nintendo already then the controversy arises 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:03.969
 of the century has said certainly I'm not 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:06.340
 satisfied with the current situation of the 

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:06.909
 machine what is admitted may not be the 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:09.490
 console 

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:11.679
 the choice for people but they recognize 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:14.259
 that maybe it is the second console 

00:01:11.679 --> 00:01:16.420
 in being selected by the 

00:01:14.259 --> 00:01:18.700
 users the truth is that man what 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:20.409
 you want me to tell you obviously this what 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:22.209
 we know we all know that wii one is the 

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:24.130
 preferred console of the users to the 

00:01:22.209 --> 00:01:27.069
 time to opt for a console between 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:29.740
 playstation 4 xbox one or will you and 

00:01:27.069 --> 00:01:31.869
 obviously we also know that it is usually 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:33.849
 the second because the play station 4 and 

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:35.829
 xbox one let's say they are going more to the 

00:01:33.849 --> 00:01:37.240
 couple are more like each other 

00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:39.159
 not then who is bought to 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:41.799
 playstation 4 normally not 

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:43.119
 you necessarily buy xbox one but 

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:45.819
 yes it is true that the catalog that 

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:47.679
 has wifi is very independent to which 

00:01:45.819 --> 00:01:50.170
 can have these other two consoles 

00:01:47.679 --> 00:01:52.270
 so good, well, you have to give those 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:54.429
 statements what is surprising is that what 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:57.069
 say openly in such a way 

00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:59.079
 normal and especially with that recent 

00:01:57.069 --> 00:02:01.659
 announcement that they are already working on 

00:01:59.079 --> 00:02:04.000
 nintendo nx it seems that they are no longer 

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:06.069
 preparing in some way for the new 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.780
 nintendo desktop console something 

00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:11.819
 which of course scandalizes the 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:11.819
 users and scandalizes the media
