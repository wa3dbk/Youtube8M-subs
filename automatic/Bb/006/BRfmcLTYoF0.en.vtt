 crystal physics capable of composing us troy 

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:21.590
 in the figurative sense a way of seeing the 

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:23.480

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:25.369
 point of view for the Brazilian market 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:26.570
 and the meaning automotive industry is 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:28.489
 much wider 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:30.700
 in chevrolet then prism is synonymous with 

00:00:28.489 --> 00:00:30.700
 success 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:39.640
 ae 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:59.370

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.750
 broke the streets and country roads 

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:06.510
 equipped with an econo.flex 1.4 engine 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:09.390
 videos and eighty-nine horses 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:11.970
 power in the alcohol version and 87 horses 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.400
 in gasoline but already from 2009 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:17.220
 gained more power by 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:19.650
 develop 95 horses with gasoline and 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.180
 they sold us 7 alcohol and that was not all 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.920
 that has changed not along its trajectory 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:26.340
 the arrest went through several modifications 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:28.710
 important but the most significant was 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:31.259
 line 2012 when it incorporated this 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.750
 new grille front panel lighting 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:36.119
 in blue color and this chrome bar in

 cover of the trunk that left 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:40.500
 more elegant is but it 's not just the visual 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.060
 that catches the attention of the 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.560
 pilot carlos who made a point of showing 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.560
 this in practice reminds 

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:59.010
 we will test the prism chevrolet making 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:04.290
 on here 

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:05.820
 ballet looks at the suspension that the person 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:11.160
 of the prism 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:13.530
 this assembly having rear 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:16.890
 of the car there has more weight and function 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:18.960
 holds a safe place for 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:20.280
 this big car saw Danadinho 

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:23.250
 rolling right 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:26.160
 the steering course needs looks like it is 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:29.600
 need to have a right pull looks 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:32.610
 need travel looks right loss 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:34.830
 just a touch in the direction and now 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:37.440
 pull all the way to the right 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:40.160
 Look, you do not need the car any more. 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:40.160
 really 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:48.010
 and for those who like the prism it has a good 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:49.660
 and bad news first bad since 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:52.630
 October last year the production of this 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:54.580
 model was now closed already good it already 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:56.560
 is back in the next program back 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:58.950
 showing all the details for you
