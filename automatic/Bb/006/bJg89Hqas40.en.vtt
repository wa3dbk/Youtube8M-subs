our belt i think is huge moving forward
when<00:02:18.510> you<00:02:18.600> watch<00:02:18.750> Wisconsin's<00:02:19.410> defense<00:02:19.770> on

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
when you watch Wisconsin's defense on

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:20.900 
when you watch Wisconsin's defense on
film<00:02:20.190> what's<00:02:20.340> the<00:02:20.460> biggest<00:02:20.760> thing<00:02:20.880> that

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
film what's the biggest thing that

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:22.940 
film what's the biggest thing that
stands<00:02:21.180> out<00:02:21.360> I<00:02:21.690> think<00:02:22.050> that<00:02:22.350> they're<00:02:22.650> they

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
stands out I think that they're they

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.220 
stands out I think that they're they
play<00:02:23.190> really<00:02:23.370> well<00:02:23.580> as<00:02:23.730> a<00:02:23.760> unit<00:02:24.180> um<00:02:24.360> you<00:02:25.110> know

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
play really well as a unit um you know

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:26.480 
play really well as a unit um you know
their<00:02:25.410> physical<00:02:25.830> they're<00:02:25.980> big<00:02:26.100> they're<00:02:26.130> big

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:26.490 
their physical they're big they're big

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:28.910 
their physical they're big they're big
players<00:02:27.080> you<00:02:28.080> know<00:02:28.170> pretty<00:02:28.350> athletic<00:02:28.530> guys

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
players you know pretty athletic guys

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:30.470 
players you know pretty athletic guys
but<00:02:29.250> I<00:02:29.280> think<00:02:29.550> their<00:02:29.850> biggest<00:02:30.120> strength<00:02:30.360> is

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
but I think their biggest strength is

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:31.490 
but I think their biggest strength is
that<00:02:30.540> they<00:02:30.810> they<00:02:30.960> don't<00:02:31.050> make<00:02:31.230> many<00:02:31.350> mistakes

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
that they they don't make many mistakes

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:35.120 
that they they don't make many mistakes
they<00:02:31.920> asks<00:02:32.130> you<00:02:32.280> well<00:02:32.520> and<00:02:33.440> you<00:02:34.440> know<00:02:34.590> they're

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
there they're really good team and the

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.510 
there they're really good team and the
record<00:02:37.020> shows<00:02:37.230> that<00:02:37.260> so<00:02:37.680> it's<00:02:38.250> gonna<00:02:38.370> be<00:02:38.460> a

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:38.520
