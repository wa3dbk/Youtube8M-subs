let me show you also the first finger
positions<00:00:37.050> and<00:00:37.739> then<00:00:38.219> they're<00:00:38.700> picking

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:39.260 
positions and then they're picking

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.920 
positions and then they're picking
pattern<00:00:40.260> and<00:00:41.129> then<00:00:41.430> I<00:00:41.460> also<00:00:41.610> show<00:00:42.360> you<00:00:42.390> some

through which strings player so let's re
one<00:00:50.160> finger<00:00:50.670> is<00:00:50.969> played<00:00:51.390> on<00:00:51.690> the<00:00:51.989> g<00:00:52.199> string

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
one finger is played on the g string

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:57.020 
one finger is played on the g string
second<00:00:52.949> fret<00:00:53.840> one<00:00:54.840> on<00:00:55.140> the<00:00:55.410> spirit<00:00:55.920> on<00:00:56.280> the

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
second fret one on the spirit on the

fourth<00:01:00.449> fret<00:01:01.379> of<00:01:02.390> them<00:01:03.890> for<00:01:05.540> strain<00:01:07.610> from<00:01:08.610> the

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
fourth fret of them for strain from the

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:14.750 
fourth fret of them for strain from the
pot<00:01:09.740> so<00:01:11.360> now<00:01:12.360> we<00:01:12.869> have<00:01:13.170> checked<00:01:13.920> out<00:01:14.130> the

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
pot so now we have checked out the

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.940 
pot so now we have checked out the
finger<00:01:15.119> positions<00:01:15.630> we're<00:01:16.439> going<00:01:16.650> to<00:01:16.770> use

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
finger positions we're going to use

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.550 
finger positions we're going to use
throughout<00:01:17.520> the<00:01:17.580> intro<00:01:18.090> now<00:01:18.960> we<00:01:19.020> have<00:01:19.290> to<00:01:19.439> look

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
throughout the intro now we have to look

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.690 
throughout the intro now we have to look
at<00:01:20.119> think<00:01:21.119> the<00:01:21.990> finger<00:01:22.259> pattern<00:01:22.700> finger

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
at think the finger pattern finger

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:30.350 
at think the finger pattern finger
picking<00:01:24.659> cotton<00:01:25.220> so<00:01:26.330> what's<00:01:27.330> this<00:01:28.939> this<00:01:29.939> was

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
picking cotton so what's this this was

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:37.870 
picking cotton so what's this this was
this<00:01:30.840> was<00:01:30.900> and<00:01:31.770> this<00:01:32.040> voice<00:01:32.400> it's<00:01:32.759> not<00:01:32.970> just

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:37.880 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:44.179 

you<00:01:38.880> go<00:01:39.240> by<00:01:39.570> the<00:01:39.600> rhythm<00:01:40.110> with<00:01:40.290> say<00:01:41.009> that<00:01:43.189> so

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
you go by the rhythm with say that so

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:51.620 
you go by the rhythm with say that so
see<00:01:44.939> you<00:01:45.030> get<00:01:45.180> it<00:01:45.299> right<00:01:48.680> no<00:01:50.090> put<00:01:51.090> the<00:01:51.119> rhythm

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630

see you get it right no put the rhythm
as<00:01:51.810> in<00:01:52.409> the<00:01:52.619> song<00:01:52.799> we<00:01:53.009> don't<00:01:53.189> want<00:01:53.310> to<00:01:53.369> go<00:01:53.460> there

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
as in the song we don't want to go there

00:01:54.090 --> 00:02:00.139 
as in the song we don't want to go there
on<00:01:54.240> my<00:01:54.540> cell<00:01:54.720> phone<00:01:56.659> if<00:01:57.659> so<00:01:58.250> totally<00:01:59.250> just<00:01:59.490> not

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
on my cell phone if so totally just not

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:05.680 
on my cell phone if so totally just not
only<00:02:00.509> difference<00:02:02.360> anyways

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:05.690 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:15.370 

we<00:02:06.410> do<00:02:06.860> this<00:02:07.840> based<00:02:08.840> on<00:02:09.020> the<00:02:09.200> position<00:02:14.380> not

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:15.380 
we do this based on the position not

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:25.780 
we do this based on the position not
then<00:02:16.010> we<00:02:16.220> remove<00:02:16.490> this<00:02:18.370> and<00:02:19.370> we<00:02:19.970> play<00:02:24.790> without

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:25.790 
then we remove this and we play without

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:28.780 
then we remove this and we play without
you<00:02:26.240> here<00:02:26.600> instead<00:02:26.810> of<00:02:27.200> that<00:02:27.860> second<00:02:28.580> thought

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790 
you here instead of that second thought

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:33.400 
you here instead of that second thought
we<00:02:28.940> had<00:02:29.090> and<00:02:29.450> we<00:02:30.250> fell<00:02:31.250> twice<00:02:31.760> not<00:02:32.330> like<00:02:32.750> the

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:33.410 
we had and we fell twice not like the

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:37.470 
we had and we fell twice not like the
one<00:02:33.590> before<00:02:33.920> which<00:02:34.370> we<00:02:34.550> did<00:02:34.760> once<00:02:35.030> folded<00:02:35.680> so

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480 
one before which we did once folded so

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:48.910 
one before which we did once folded so
the<00:02:38.480> two<00:02:38.870> of<00:02:38.900> them<00:02:39.260> together<00:02:39.470> sound<00:02:40.130> right<00:02:47.920> so

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:48.920 
the two of them together sound right so

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:54.520 
the two of them together sound right so
anyway<00:02:49.600> once<00:02:50.600> set<00:02:51.410> on<00:02:51.590> your<00:02:51.770> new<00:02:52.040> place<00:02:53.530> it's

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:54.530 
anyway once set on your new place it's

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:59.890 
anyway once set on your new place it's
the<00:02:54.710> same<00:02:55.010> shadow<00:02:55.780> second<00:02:56.780> 50<00:02:57.790> friends<00:02:58.900> any

00:02:59.890 --> 00:02:59.900 
the same shadow second 50 friends any

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:03.790 
the same shadow second 50 friends any
open<00:03:00.230> string<00:03:01.570> then<00:03:02.570> we<00:03:02.900> are<00:03:02.960> going<00:03:03.170> to<00:03:03.290> move<00:03:03.440> on

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:03.800 
open string then we are going to move on

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:08.740 
open string then we are going to move on
to<00:03:04.150> this<00:03:05.150> finger<00:03:05.630> position<00:03:07.060> which<00:03:08.060> is<00:03:08.090> quite

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:08.750 
to this finger position which is quite

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:11.729 
to this finger position which is quite
the<00:03:08.810> same<00:03:08.960> thing<00:03:09.230> but<00:03:09.440> in<00:03:09.830> that

00:03:11.729 --> 00:03:11.739 
the same thing but in that

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:14.500 
the same thing but in that
finger-picking<00:03:12.739> pattern<00:03:13.030> it's<00:03:14.030> different

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:14.510 
finger-picking pattern it's different

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:18.070 
finger-picking pattern it's different
cause<00:03:14.709> we<00:03:15.709> are<00:03:15.890> gonna<00:03:16.070> miss<00:03:16.370> out<00:03:16.670> a<00:03:17.090> string<00:03:17.630> we

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:18.080 
cause we are gonna miss out a string we

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:22.120 
cause we are gonna miss out a string we
did<00:03:18.320> from<00:03:18.560> the<00:03:18.830> previous<00:03:19.340> two<00:03:19.600> which<00:03:20.600> is<00:03:21.130> this

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:22.130 
did from the previous two which is this

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:25.690 
did from the previous two which is this
swing<00:03:22.910> which<00:03:23.270> is<00:03:23.450> a<00:03:23.480> t-shirt<00:03:24.160> so<00:03:25.160> it's<00:03:25.580> like

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:25.700 
swing which is a t-shirt so it's like

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:43.440 
swing which is a t-shirt so it's like
this<00:03:26.030> one<00:03:31.000> which<00:03:32.000> they<00:03:32.239> will<00:03:32.450> stop<00:03:32.840> us<00:03:33.100> so<00:03:34.100> this

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:43.450 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:47.229 

okay<00:03:44.530> so<00:03:45.530> this<00:03:45.980> is<00:03:46.160> this<00:03:46.400> get<00:03:46.640> the<00:03:46.760> first<00:03:47.030> part

00:03:47.229 --> 00:03:47.239 
okay so this is this get the first part

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:51.360 
okay so this is this get the first part
the<00:03:47.900> second<00:03:48.260> part<00:03:48.290> a<00:03:48.850> not<00:03:49.850> much<00:03:50.450> different<00:03:50.989> one

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:51.370 
the second part a not much different one

00:03:51.370 --> 00:04:05.830 
the second part a not much different one
instead<00:03:52.370> of<00:03:52.610> doing<00:03:54.010> with<00:03:59.980> to<00:04:00.980> do<00:04:01.130> this<00:04:03.489> as<00:04:04.840> in

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:05.840 
instead of doing with to do this as in

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:09.880 
instead of doing with to do this as in
that<00:04:06.080> where<00:04:06.860> the<00:04:07.519> lead<00:04:08.239> singer<00:04:08.540> is<00:04:08.660> gonna<00:04:08.890> come

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:09.890 
that where the lead singer is gonna come

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:39.640
