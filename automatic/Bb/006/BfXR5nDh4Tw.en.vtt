00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:52.780 
deep in that these particular elements

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:54.750 
deep in that these particular elements
are<00:02:52.900> perhaps<00:02:53.650> it<00:02:53.890> was<00:02:54.010> only<00:02:54.069> a<00:02:54.220> couple<00:02:54.489> of

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.760 
are perhaps it was only a couple of

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:56.250 
are perhaps it was only a couple of
sections<00:02:55.000> of<00:02:55.360> the<00:02:55.480> game<00:02:55.660> that<00:02:55.930> they<00:02:56.049> fought

sections of the game that they fought

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:01.170 
sections of the game that they fought
almost<00:02:56.410> pushing<00:02:57.400> it<00:02:57.489> a<00:02:57.579> bit<00:02:57.610> too<00:02:57.760> far<00:02:59.700> mmm<00:03:00.700> but

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:01.180 
almost pushing it a bit too far mmm but

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:02.369 
almost pushing it a bit too far mmm but
I<00:03:01.209> don't<00:03:01.480> know<00:03:01.629> they<00:03:01.870> haven't<00:03:02.079> really<00:03:02.290> said

00:03:02.369 --> 00:03:02.379 
I don't know they haven't really said

00:03:02.379 --> 00:03:04.740 
I don't know they haven't really said
all<00:03:02.799> they<00:03:02.920> said<00:03:03.129> is<00:03:03.310> that<00:03:03.459> it<00:03:03.610> has<00:03:03.819> a<00:03:04.060> couple<00:03:04.690> of

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:04.750 
all they said is that it has a couple of

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:06.000 
all they said is that it has a couple of
things<00:03:04.780> which<00:03:05.140> I<00:03:05.290> don't<00:03:05.470> think<00:03:05.680> I<00:03:05.769> right<00:03:05.980> that

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.010 
things which I don't think I right that

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:08.100 
things which I don't think I right that
the<00:03:06.310> implied<00:03:06.579> sexual<00:03:06.970> violence<00:03:07.329> and<00:03:07.750> the<00:03:07.930> use

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:08.110 
the implied sexual violence and the use

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:11.850 
the implied sexual violence and the use
of<00:03:08.140> drugs<00:03:08.500> and<00:03:08.920> so<00:03:09.700> on<00:03:09.879> all<00:03:10.090> these<00:03:10.959> related<00:03:11.620> to

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:11.860 
of drugs and so on all these related to

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:14.190 
of drugs and so on all these related to
incentives<00:03:12.430> or<00:03:12.640> rewards<00:03:12.670> so<00:03:13.450> maybe<00:03:13.840> those<00:03:14.170> two

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:14.200 
incentives or rewards so maybe those two

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:16.710 
incentives or rewards so maybe those two
bits<00:03:14.739> will<00:03:15.099> only<00:03:15.610> have<00:03:15.819> to<00:03:15.849> remove<00:03:16.209> me<00:03:16.390> remove

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:16.720 
bits will only have to remove me remove

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:18.539 
bits will only have to remove me remove
but<00:03:16.930> for<00:03:17.049> all<00:03:17.140> I<00:03:17.260> know<00:03:17.319> those<00:03:18.040> kind<00:03:18.340> of<00:03:18.370> bits

00:03:18.539 --> 00:03:18.549 
but for all I know those kind of bits

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:20.039 
but for all I know those kind of bits
are<00:03:18.700> all<00:03:18.819> over<00:03:19.000> the<00:03:19.269> game<00:03:19.450> and<00:03:19.629> a<00:03:19.660> lots<00:03:19.840> going

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:21.790 
to have to be cut out it's really tough

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:25.620 
to have to be cut out it's really tough
to<00:03:21.819> say<00:03:22.120> what<00:03:22.780> I<00:03:22.810> hope<00:03:23.170> is<00:03:23.530> that<00:03:24.329> the<00:03:25.329> final

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:25.630 
to say what I hope is that the final

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:27.690 
to say what I hope is that the final
product<00:03:26.079> will<00:03:26.230> not<00:03:26.530> be<00:03:26.680> affected<00:03:27.220> too<00:03:27.250> much

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:27.700 
product will not be affected too much

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:30.270 
product will not be affected too much
that<00:03:28.299> the<00:03:28.480> game<00:03:28.690> will<00:03:28.870> still<00:03:29.139> be<00:03:29.290> the<00:03:29.859> same<00:03:29.889> at

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:30.280 
that the game will still be the same at

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:32.879 
that the game will still be the same at
heart<00:03:30.519> of<00:03:30.670> just<00:03:30.880> a<00:03:31.000> few<00:03:31.299> minor<00:03:31.750> tweaks<00:03:32.079> to<00:03:32.739> get

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:32.889 
heart of just a few minor tweaks to get

00:03:32.889 --> 00:03:34.860

it released in the country I'm sure

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:37.710 
it released in the country I'm sure
they're<00:03:35.079> going<00:03:35.290> to<00:03:35.650> try<00:03:36.430> that<00:03:36.700> at<00:03:37.150> first<00:03:37.359> and

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:37.720 
they're going to try that at first and

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:39.569 
they're going to try that at first and
see<00:03:37.840> if<00:03:37.900> they<00:03:38.019> can<00:03:38.170> then<00:03:38.380> get<00:03:38.560> it<00:03:38.739> released<00:03:39.069> and

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:39.579 
see if they can then get it released and

00:03:39.579 --> 00:03:41.819 
see if they can then get it released and
then<00:03:39.700> if<00:03:40.299> it<00:03:40.569> get<00:03:40.690> failed<00:03:40.930> again<00:03:41.170> taking<00:03:41.560> more

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:41.829 
then if it get failed again taking more

00:03:41.829 --> 00:03:44.819 
then if it get failed again taking more
out<00:03:42.010> but<00:03:42.340> let's<00:03:42.849> just<00:03:42.940> hope<00:03:43.269> that's<00:03:43.690> the<00:03:43.930> full

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:44.829 
out but let's just hope that's the full

00:03:44.829 --> 00:03:47.640 
out but let's just hope that's the full
game<00:03:45.040> isn't<00:03:45.700> tarnished<00:03:46.480> too<00:03:46.900> much<00:03:47.200> for<00:03:47.560> the

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:47.650 
game isn't tarnished too much for the

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:49.199 
game isn't tarnished too much for the
Australian<00:03:48.430> audience<00:03:48.819> because<00:03:49.090> obviously

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:49.209 
Australian audience because obviously

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:50.879 
Australian audience because obviously
they<00:03:49.540> want<00:03:49.750> to<00:03:49.840> play<00:03:49.959> center<00:03:50.349> for<00:03:50.590> as<00:03:50.680> much<00:03:50.829> as

00:03:50.879 --> 00:03:50.889 
they want to play center for as much as

00:03:50.889 --> 00:03:53.430 
they want to play center for as much as
we<00:03:51.099> do<00:03:51.280> and<00:03:51.489> unfortunately<00:03:52.410> they're<00:03:53.410> not

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:53.440 
we do and unfortunately they're not

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:55.440 
we do and unfortunately they're not
going<00:03:53.739> to<00:03:53.829> get<00:03:54.069> to<00:03:54.280> the<00:03:54.430> same<00:03:54.700> game<00:03:54.970> that<00:03:55.180> we<00:03:55.299> do

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:55.450 
going to get to the same game that we do

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:57.449 
going to get to the same game that we do
due<00:03:55.690> to<00:03:55.840> this<00:03:55.989> problem<00:03:56.230> so<00:03:57.130> let's<00:03:57.310> just

00:03:57.449 --> 00:03:57.459 
due to this problem so let's just

00:03:57.459 --> 00:03:59.879 
due to this problem so let's just
fingers<00:03:57.910> crossed<00:03:58.209> for<00:03:58.329> them<00:03:58.660> that's<00:03:59.139> not<00:03:59.709> too

00:03:59.879 --> 00:03:59.889 
fingers crossed for them that's not too

00:03:59.889 --> 00:04:01.589 
fingers crossed for them that's not too
much<00:04:00.040> the<00:04:00.250> gamer<00:04:00.459> has<00:04:00.910> to<00:04:01.090> actually<00:04:01.239> be

00:04:01.589 --> 00:04:01.599 
much the gamer has to actually be

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:04.589 
much the gamer has to actually be
changed<00:04:02.079> or<00:04:02.230> taken<00:04:02.709> out<00:04:02.950> to<00:04:03.730> make<00:04:04.000> it<00:04:04.269> actually

00:04:04.589 --> 00:04:04.599 
changed or taken out to make it actually

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:06.870 
changed or taken out to make it actually
sellable<00:04:05.470> in<00:04:05.650> that<00:04:05.829> country<00:04:06.430> because<00:04:06.700> that

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:06.880 
sellable in that country because that

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:09.780 
sellable in that country because that
would<00:04:07.030> just<00:04:07.060> be<00:04:07.299> a<00:04:07.419> real<00:04:07.750> shame<00:04:07.780> and<00:04:08.790> although

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:09.790 
would just be a real shame and although

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:11.640 
would just be a real shame and although
this<00:04:10.060> is<00:04:10.299> great<00:04:10.599> that<00:04:10.900> they've<00:04:11.079> got<00:04:11.230> this<00:04:11.410> new

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:11.650 
this is great that they've got this new

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:13.470 
this is great that they've got this new
classification<00:04:12.160> because<00:04:12.700> before<00:04:13.239> this

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:13.480 
classification because before this

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:16.229 
classification because before this
obviously<00:04:13.959> there<00:04:14.380> were<00:04:15.030> disallowing<00:04:16.030> games

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:16.239 
obviously there were disallowing games

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:17.550 
obviously there were disallowing games
left<00:04:16.510> right<00:04:16.660> and<00:04:16.780> center<00:04:17.019> because<00:04:17.169> there<00:04:17.440> was

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:17.560 
left right and center because there was

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:19.979 
left right and center because there was
no<00:04:17.709> adult<00:04:18.070> category<00:04:18.459> obviously<00:04:19.389> since<00:04:19.630> then

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:19.989 
no adult category obviously since then

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:21.779 
no adult category obviously since then
more<00:04:20.530> games<00:04:20.799> have<00:04:21.130> been<00:04:21.250> been<00:04:21.430> able<00:04:21.609> to

00:04:21.779 --> 00:04:21.789 
more games have been been able to

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:23.010 
more games have been been able to
release<00:04:22.060> on<00:04:22.210> Australia<00:04:22.570> which<00:04:22.720> is<00:04:22.840> fantastic

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:23.020 
release on Australia which is fantastic

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:25.649 
release on Australia which is fantastic
however<00:04:23.979> I<00:04:24.280> suppose<00:04:25.060> there<00:04:25.270> had<00:04:25.300> to<00:04:25.510> be<00:04:25.539> a

00:04:25.649 --> 00:04:25.659 
however I suppose there had to be a

00:04:25.659 --> 00:04:27.810 
however I suppose there had to be a
first<00:04:26.050> game<00:04:26.440> to<00:04:26.740> fall<00:04:27.130> foul<00:04:27.430> of<00:04:27.460> that

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:27.820 
first game to fall foul of that

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:29.969 
first game to fall foul of that
classification<00:04:28.270> and<00:04:28.930> say<00:04:29.530> its<00:04:29.650> row<00:04:29.770> for

00:04:29.969 --> 00:04:29.979 
classification and say its row for

00:04:29.979 --> 00:04:30.690 
classification and say its row for
unsurprised

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:30.700 
unsurprised

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:32.490 
unsurprised
I<00:04:30.730> suppose<00:04:31.360> given<00:04:31.570> the<00:04:31.870> nature<00:04:32.080> of<00:04:32.260> that

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:32.500 
I suppose given the nature of that

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:35.340 
I suppose given the nature of that
series<00:04:32.920> has<00:04:33.820> been<00:04:34.180> that<00:04:34.420> one<00:04:34.720> so<00:04:34.990> let's<00:04:35.170> just

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:35.350 
series has been that one so let's just

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:37.080 
series has been that one so let's just
see<00:04:35.530> what<00:04:35.710> happens<00:04:35.740> at<00:04:36.190> the<00:04:36.280> curious<00:04:36.640> to<00:04:36.910> you
