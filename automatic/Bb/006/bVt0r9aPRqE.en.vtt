00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:18.320 
before giving its of the black string

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:20.650 
before giving its of the black string
that<00:02:18.860> is<00:02:18.920> just<00:02:19.250> a<00:02:19.400> magical<00:02:19.700> device<00:02:20.330> to<00:02:20.540> me

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:20.660 
that is just a magical device to me

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:22.960 
that is just a magical device to me
obviously<00:02:21.560> the<00:02:21.830> choice<00:02:22.040> is<00:02:22.190> clear<00:02:22.220> the

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:22.970 
obviously the choice is clear the

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:25.660 
obviously the choice is clear the
iphones<00:02:23.360> will<00:02:23.600> win<00:02:23.810> this<00:02:24.080> test<00:02:24.440> but<00:02:24.950> let's<00:02:25.490> see

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670 
iphones will win this test but let's see

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:27.340 
iphones will win this test but let's see
how<00:02:25.850> many<00:02:26.060> more<00:02:26.240> stress<00:02:26.540> test<00:02:26.810> this<00:02:26.959> device

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:27.350 
how many more stress test this device

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:31.510 
how many more stress test this device
can<00:02:27.560> handle<00:02:28.420> we<00:02:29.420> are<00:02:29.510> doing<00:02:29.720> the<00:02:30.530> xbox<00:02:31.040> 360

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:31.520 
can handle we are doing the xbox 360

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:34.180 
can handle we are doing the xbox 360
kinect<00:02:31.970> versus<00:02:32.510> the<00:02:32.600> iphone<00:02:32.959> 4<00:02:33.200> gyroscope<00:02:33.770> we

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:34.190 
kinect versus the iphone 4 gyroscope we

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:36.729 
kinect versus the iphone 4 gyroscope we
will<00:02:34.370> see<00:02:34.550> who<00:02:34.730> the<00:02:34.880> clear<00:02:35.090> winner<00:02:35.300> is<00:02:35.570> ok<00:02:36.350> so

00:02:36.729 --> 00:02:36.739 
will see who the clear winner is ok so

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:38.140 
will see who the clear winner is ok so
the<00:02:36.890> kinect<00:02:37.250> it's<00:02:37.550> a<00:02:37.610> bunch<00:02:37.820> of<00:02:37.940> little

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.150 
the kinect it's a bunch of little

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:43.690 
the kinect it's a bunch of little
sensors<00:02:38.660> that<00:02:39.020> are<00:02:39.350> oh<00:02:42.040> ok<00:02:43.040> so<00:02:43.520> i<00:02:43.550> will

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:43.700 
sensors that are oh ok so i will

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:45.550 
sensors that are oh ok so i will
continue<00:02:44.000> on<00:02:44.360> the<00:02:44.510> mothership<00:02:44.989> before<00:02:45.470> the

faster this is amazing look at the

00:03:49.579 --> 00:03:51.100 
faster this is amazing look at the
kinect<00:03:49.940> tracking<00:03:50.329> all<00:03:50.450> this<00:03:50.570> the<00:03:50.720> kinect<00:03:51.019> is

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:51.110 
kinect tracking all this the kinect is

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:56.640 
kinect tracking all this the kinect is
just<00:03:51.320> oh<00:03:51.500> no<00:03:52.160> don't<00:03:52.430> kill<00:03:52.670> each<00:03:52.730> other<00:03:52.940> no<00:03:53.239> no

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:56.650

ok<00:03:57.650> so<00:03:58.040> now<00:03:58.190> we<00:03:58.250> are<00:03:58.430> going<00:03:58.610> to<00:03:58.730> compare<00:03:59.030> the

00:03:59.170 --> 00:03:59.180 
ok so now we are going to compare the

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:02.110 
ok so now we are going to compare the
graphics<00:03:59.569> the<00:04:00.080> xbox<00:04:00.500> 360<00:04:01.160> versity<00:04:01.760> the<00:04:01.819> iphone

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:02.120 
graphics the xbox 360 versity the iphone

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:04.640 
graphics the xbox 360 versity the iphone
for<00:04:02.390> this<00:04:02.720> would<00:04:02.900> surely<00:04:03.050> be<00:04:03.290> an<00:04:03.500> amazing<00:04:03.709> test

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:04.650 
for this would surely be an amazing test

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:06.530 
for this would surely be an amazing test
everyone<00:04:04.950> just<00:04:05.189> might<00:04:05.459> be<00:04:05.670> clear<00:04:06.060> winner<00:04:06.269> but

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:06.540 
everyone just might be clear winner but

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:08.179 
everyone just might be clear winner but
we<00:04:06.659> don't<00:04:06.810> know<00:04:07.049> it<00:04:07.379> is<00:04:07.530> tied<00:04:07.769> right<00:04:08.040> now

00:04:08.179 --> 00:04:08.189 
we don't know it is tied right now

00:04:08.189 --> 00:04:10.520 
we don't know it is tied right now
