thread a bobbin I'll put the thread here

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:21.810 
thread a bobbin I'll put the thread here
on<00:00:18.640> the<00:00:18.880> spool<00:00:19.180> pin<00:00:19.210> at<00:00:19.720> the<00:00:19.779> base<00:00:20.110> and<00:00:20.699> here<00:00:21.699> is

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:21.820 
on the spool pin at the base and here is

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:24.060 
on the spool pin at the base and here is
the<00:00:21.970> bobbin<00:00:22.359> you<00:00:23.140> will<00:00:23.289> see<00:00:23.470> it<00:00:23.560> has<00:00:23.740> holes

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:24.070 
the bobbin you will see it has holes

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:26.970 
the bobbin you will see it has holes
inside<00:00:24.730> and<00:00:25.210> I'm<00:00:26.170> going<00:00:26.380> to<00:00:26.439> thread<00:00:26.800> the

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:26.980 
inside and I'm going to thread the

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:29.880 
inside and I'm going to thread the
thread<00:00:27.310> through<00:00:28.180> one<00:00:28.480> of<00:00:28.510> the<00:00:28.720> holes<00:00:28.930> in<00:00:29.470> the

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:29.890 
thread through one of the holes in the

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:33.660 
thread through one of the holes in the
side<00:00:30.300> so<00:00:31.300> it<00:00:31.420> comes<00:00:31.689> out<00:00:31.960> from<00:00:32.769> the<00:00:32.949> center<00:00:33.370> to

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:33.670 
side so it comes out from the center to

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:39.030 
side so it comes out from the center to
the<00:00:33.850> side<00:00:36.000> now<00:00:37.000> I<00:00:37.390> will<00:00:37.600> put<00:00:37.900> the<00:00:38.320> bobbin<00:00:38.530> onto

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:39.040 
the side now I will put the bobbin onto

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:43.740 
the side now I will put the bobbin onto
the<00:00:39.489> bobbin<00:00:39.909> winder<00:00:39.940> and<00:00:41.250> turn<00:00:42.250> it<00:00:42.750> because

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:43.750 
the bobbin winder and turn it because

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:45.509 
the bobbin winder and turn it because
there<00:00:43.960> is<00:00:43.989> a<00:00:44.080> little<00:00:44.409> pin<00:00:44.589> that<00:00:44.620> engages<00:00:45.190> it

00:00:45.509 --> 00:00:45.519 
there is a little pin that engages it

00:00:45.519 --> 00:00:47.549 
there is a little pin that engages it
into<00:00:45.820> place<00:00:46.059> it's<00:00:46.390> just<00:00:46.690> gone<00:00:46.870> straight<00:00:47.170> into

00:00:47.549 --> 00:00:47.559 
into place it's just gone straight into

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:50.700 
into place it's just gone straight into
place<00:00:47.830> and<00:00:48.299> I'm<00:00:49.299> now<00:00:49.479> going<00:00:49.720> to<00:00:49.809> engage<00:00:50.199> the

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:50.710 
place and I'm now going to engage the

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:53.939 
place and I'm now going to engage the
bobbin<00:00:51.010> winder<00:00:51.430> by<00:00:51.580> pushing<00:00:51.909> it<00:00:52.150> down<00:00:52.830> so<00:00:53.830> it

00:00:53.939 --> 00:00:53.949 
bobbin winder by pushing it down so it

00:00:53.949 --> 00:00:56.399 
bobbin winder by pushing it down so it
comes<00:00:54.190> the<00:00:54.670> rubber<00:00:54.909> tire<00:00:55.239> comes<00:00:55.659> into<00:00:55.960> contact

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:56.409 
comes the rubber tire comes into contact

00:00:56.409 --> 00:00:59.399 
comes the rubber tire comes into contact
with<00:00:56.530> the<00:00:56.769> balance<00:00:57.070> wheel<00:00:57.309> here<00:00:58.350> now<00:00:59.350> the

00:00:59.399 --> 00:00:59.409 
with the balance wheel here now the

00:00:59.409 --> 00:01:02.759 
with the balance wheel here now the
thread<00:01:00.000> needs<00:01:01.000> to<00:01:01.299> go<00:01:01.479> underneath<00:01:01.780> this

00:01:02.759 --> 00:01:02.769 
thread needs to go underneath this

00:01:02.769 --> 00:01:06.030 
thread needs to go underneath this
thread<00:01:03.189> guide<00:01:03.489> here<00:01:04.000> at<00:01:04.269> the<00:01:04.510> bottom<00:01:04.869> and<00:01:05.110> up

thread guide here at the bottom and up
to<00:01:06.280> the<00:01:06.369> right<00:01:06.930> so<00:01:07.930> I'll<00:01:08.049> pull<00:01:08.380> that<00:01:08.590> a<00:01:09.030> little

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:10.030 
to the right so I'll pull that a little

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:16.320 
to the right so I'll pull that a little
tauter<00:01:14.280> so<00:01:15.280> now<00:01:15.460> you<00:01:15.580> can<00:01:15.790> see<00:01:15.970> that<00:01:16.210> the

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:16.330 
tauter so now you can see that the

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:20.580 
tauter so now you can see that the
thread<00:01:16.660> goes<00:01:17.170> underneath<00:01:18.040> the<00:01:18.370> guide<00:01:19.020> up<00:01:20.020> from

the balance wheel and I have a spare
tail<00:01:30.040> here<00:01:30.610> to<00:01:31.510> make<00:01:31.690> sure<00:01:31.720> it<00:01:31.990> doesn't<00:01:32.170> come

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:32.290 
tail here to make sure it doesn't come

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:36.780 
tail here to make sure it doesn't come
and<00:01:32.590> thread<00:01:32.860> it<00:01:33.690> now<00:01:34.690> I'm<00:01:34.990> going<00:01:35.200> to<00:01:35.610> turn<00:01:36.610> the

and thread it now I'm going to turn the

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:40.770 
and thread it now I'm going to turn the
balance<00:01:37.120> wheel<00:01:37.590> gently<00:01:38.590> towards<00:01:39.250> me<00:01:39.570> so<00:01:40.570> that

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:40.780 
balance wheel gently towards me so that

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:45.149 
balance wheel gently towards me so that
it<00:01:40.960> starts<00:01:41.320> winding<00:01:41.860> onto<00:01:42.700> the<00:01:42.790> bobbin<00:01:44.159> it's

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:45.159 
it starts winding onto the bobbin it's

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:48.600 
it starts winding onto the bobbin it's
now<00:01:45.430> winding<00:01:46.060> and<00:01:46.770> because<00:01:47.770> it's<00:01:47.920> all<00:01:48.100> in

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:03.980 
make sure that the balance wheel is

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:07.630 
make sure that the balance wheel is
coming<00:02:04.310> towards<00:02:04.790> you<00:02:05.860> get<00:02:06.860> the<00:02:07.070> motion<00:02:07.250> with

it's<00:02:15.200> a<00:02:15.349> noisy<00:02:15.739> machine<00:02:16.120> so<00:02:17.120> I<00:02:17.150> think<00:02:17.450> we'll

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:17.630 
it's a noisy machine so I think we'll
