00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.620
 ah 

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:14.420
 hello on this occasion he taught you how 

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:16.929
 make an easy and original cake 

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:16.929
 inflatable 

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:20.950
 i 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:26.720
 for this tutorial you're going to need a 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:28.220
 colored sheet although you can also 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:30.439
 use a larger sheet of paper 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:34.689
 that depends on the size of what you want 

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:34.689
 your letter also down and scissors 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.489
 let's start with a little origami 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:43.380
 take your colored sheet and take the corner 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:46.910
 top right to the other end 

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:46.910
 of the leaf like this 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:58.320
 when you are sure it is okay 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:01:00.420
 aligned marks the fold 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:04.550
 until now you must have this figure 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.550
 cut this rectangle with your scissors 

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:10.850
 now you must have this figure and the 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:15.119
 unfold you have a diagonal line in 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:17.409
 medium and the shape of a square 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:20.439
 take the upper right corner and 

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:22.159
 take it to the opposite corner of this 

00:01:20.439 --> 00:01:26.109
 way 

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:26.109
 once there he marks the doubles 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:32.990
 if it unfolds it must look like this with a 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:35.990
 x in the middle 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:37.790
 now fold it in half like that when 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:40.149
 Be sure that it is aligned brand 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:40.149
 the fold 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:47.170
 now take the upper right corner 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:50.490
 we are going to put it in 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:54.020
 push it in like this 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:54.020
 now mark the folds 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:56.940
 and ready 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:01.310
 actually this is one of the parties 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:03.620
 most important of the letter why here 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:05.870
 goes again slower takes the corner and 

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:09.790
 push it in and since it's 

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:09.790
 in it marks the folds 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:18.880
 ready you should stay this way 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:20.470
 triangular on one side now repeats the 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:22.650
 procedure with the corner of the other 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:22.650
 side 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:34.569
 half 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:34.569
 you must have something like that 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:41.410
 now take the lower right corner and 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:45.569
 take it up in this way 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:45.569
 Mark the bend when you're ready 

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:51.780
 Now do the same with the corner of the 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:51.780
 other side 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:57.730
 make sure to mark the folds well 

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:06.389
 when ready turn the figure and 

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:06.389
 repeat the procedure on the other side 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:16.500
 you must have this until now by the 

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:16.500
 two sides 

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:21.540
 Take this corner and see that there are two 

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:24.390
 one up and one down takes the 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:26.820
 up and fold it to the center that the 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:29.180
 point touch the center line and mark 

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:29.180
 the fold 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:35.180
 repeat the procedure on the other side 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:39.520
 flip the figure is the same 

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:46.650
 you must have this figure so far 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:49.200
 now notice that on this side we have 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:52.030
 an opening that is more noticeable when 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:54.430
 we open the papers look 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:57.910
 and on the other side we do not have any 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:04:00.069
 opening is closed so now it takes 

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:02.140
 your scissors and cut a little more to 

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:03.640
 the opening is made larger must 

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:05.180
 of having become a little bit bigger 

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:07.640
 how is it 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:09.849
 now take it this way and inflated 

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:09.849
 A) Yes 

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:16.209
 already inflated it will look like this now brand 

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:18.340
 the side opposite the opening 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:21.510
 edges to be made as a way 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:21.510
 square like that 

00:04:23.139 --> 00:04:26.909
 should start to look like this 

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:34.030
 since you have marked it well then of 

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:34.030
 those the figure completely 

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:36.290
 yes 

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:42.650
 you will be left with a picture in 

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:45.550
 half there with your lungs starts to 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:45.550
 write your letter 

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:49.930
 remember to use a color of the down 

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:53.169
 dark so that when it is isolated to 

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:54.689
 the letter can read it 

00:04:53.169 --> 00:04:56.759
 r 

00:04:54.689 --> 00:04:58.380
 also decorated to make it look more 

00:04:56.759 --> 00:05:00.090
 cute 

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:02.160
 when you have finished writing your 

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:03.480
 letter reassembles the figure following 

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:05.900
 the same steps you did to the 

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:05.900
 beginning 

00:05:09.229 --> 00:05:12.229
 here 

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:23.470
 yes 

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:32.530
 when they have this figure, they pay a lot 

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:34.660
 attention that we are going to double in the 

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:37.450
 inward corners in this opening 

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:41.290
 what we are going to do is take the corner 

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:46.009
 and take the tip to the shore where 

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:49.069
 there is this peak and it marks the fold 

00:05:46.009 --> 00:05:51.169
 now take it like that folded and take it 

00:05:49.069 --> 00:05:52.969
 towards the side where the opening is 

00:05:51.169 --> 00:05:55.629
 bone in this case is the left side 

00:05:52.969 --> 00:05:55.629
 A) Yes 

00:05:55.700 --> 00:06:00.940
 re- mark the fold and then 

00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:00.940
 insert it in the invoice 

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:07.040
 when you have inserted it, repeat the 

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:10.340
 procedure but on the other side 

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:12.860
 look, take your corner on the right and 

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:17.590
 bend the tip to the other end of 

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:17.590
 this guy who is there marks the doubles 

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:24.849
 now fold this you did towards the 

00:06:23.169 --> 00:06:26.590
 side of the opening in this case will be 

00:06:24.849 --> 00:06:30.449
 right side and redial your doubles 

00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:30.449
 then put the virtue 

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:39.550
 you 

00:06:39.569 --> 00:06:45.800
 now it must be seen like this repeats the 

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:45.800
 procedure on the other side of the figure 

00:06:46.889 --> 00:06:52.680
 When you are finished, it should look like this 

00:06:49.389 --> 00:06:52.680
 with the opening on this side 

00:06:53.889 --> 00:06:58.379
 now take your markers and start 

00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:58.379
 decorate 

00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:11.110
 when you finish decorating your letter is 

00:07:09.010 --> 00:07:13.090
 ready to give away remember to explain to 

00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:15.850
 the person who must inflate the first 

00:07:13.090 --> 00:07:18.520
 blowing through the hole to be able to read 

00:07:15.850 --> 00:07:20.860
 the content once it's inflated 

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:23.580
 just improve the hole and read what 

00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:23.580
 says your letter 

00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:28.420
 m 

00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:30.520
 remember that it was necessary to do it in 

00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:34.440
 a sheet size letter you can make it more 

00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:34.440
 big and decorate it in different ways 

00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:48.090
 and camps whom I had as a PAN 

00:07:45.580 --> 00:07:48.090
 as well
