tighter alright
yeah<00:01:29.980> tire<00:01:30.980> back<00:01:31.280> right<00:01:31.550> just<00:01:32.510> so<00:01:32.570> I<00:01:32.600> know<00:01:32.660> what

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:32.780 
yeah tire back right just so I know what

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:35.200 
yeah tire back right just so I know what
your<00:01:32.930> tire<00:01:33.080> is<00:01:33.520> I'm<00:01:34.520> gonna<00:01:34.700> position<00:01:34.940> the

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:35.210 
your tire is I'm gonna position the

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:38.920 
your tire is I'm gonna position the
wheel<00:01:35.410> where<00:01:36.410> I<00:01:36.440> wanted<00:01:36.800> to<00:01:36.950> or<00:01:37.160> you<00:01:37.220> or<00:01:37.490> to<00:01:37.930> I'm

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:38.930 
wheel where I wanted to or you or to I'm

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:42.370 
wheel where I wanted to or you or to I'm
gonna<00:01:39.350> rotate<00:01:39.650> it<00:01:39.980> 90<00:01:40.700> degrees<00:01:40.730> so<00:01:41.210> shift<00:01:41.690> and

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:42.380 
gonna rotate it 90 degrees so shift and

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:53.470 
gonna rotate it 90 degrees so shift and
rotate<00:01:44.470> move<00:01:45.470> it

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:53.480 

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:57.550 

rotate<00:01:54.700> see<00:01:56.140> that's<00:01:57.140> not<00:01:57.230> even<00:01:57.290> that

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:57.560 
rotate see that's not even that

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.100 
rotate see that's not even that
complicated<00:01:58.130> but<00:01:58.480> real<00:01:59.480> I<00:01:59.510> said<00:01:59.810> what<00:01:59.960> four

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:00.110 
complicated but real I said what four

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:01.570 
complicated but real I said what four
days<00:02:00.230> made<00:02:00.440> it<00:02:00.530> really<00:02:00.680> simple<00:02:01.010> to<00:02:01.310> do<00:02:01.430> this

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:01.580 
days made it really simple to do this

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:10.990 
days made it really simple to do this
kind<00:02:01.760> of<00:02:01.790> stuff

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:11.000 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.460 

then<00:02:11.540> you're<00:02:11.660> gonna<00:02:11.750> most<00:02:11.960> like<00:02:12.080> so<00:02:12.350> that

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:12.470 
then you're gonna most like so that

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:15.550 
then you're gonna most like so that
connector<00:02:12.950> there<00:02:13.880> I<00:02:13.910> picked<00:02:14.150> a<00:02:14.440> you<00:02:15.440> gotta

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 
connector there I picked a you gotta

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:18.090 
connector there I picked a you gotta
delete<00:02:15.890> it<00:02:16.130> more<00:02:16.310> like<00:02:16.430> -<00:02:16.610> it's<00:02:16.820> like<00:02:16.970> on

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:18.100 
delete it more like - it's like on

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:29.380 
delete it more like - it's like on
because<00:02:19.100> a<00:02:19.130> body<00:02:22.420> and<00:02:23.420> for<00:02:23.600> object<00:02:23.960> B<00:02:28.060> is<00:02:29.060> gonna

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:29.390 
because a body and for object B is gonna

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:34.030 
because a body and for object B is gonna
be<00:02:29.510> the<00:02:29.810> tile<00:02:30.050> tire<00:02:30.950> not<00:02:31.670> tile<00:02:31.940> tiger<00:02:32.800> or<00:02:33.800> the

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:34.040 
be the tile tire not tile tiger or the

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:40.980 
be the tile tire not tile tiger or the
wheel<00:02:34.190> whatever<00:02:34.760> you<00:02:34.880> call<00:02:35.090> it

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:40.990 

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:42.940 

next<00:02:41.990> you're<00:02:42.110> gonna<00:02:42.200> want<00:02:42.320> to<00:02:42.500> lick<00:02:42.620> the<00:02:42.740> body

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:42.950 
next you're gonna want to lick the body

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:47.200 
next you're gonna want to lick the body
and<00:02:43.400> the<00:02:43.850> tire<00:02:44.390> or<00:02:44.870> the<00:02:44.930> wheel<00:02:45.260> wherever<00:02:46.210> and

and the tire or the wheel wherever and

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:53.650 
and the tire or the wheel wherever and
give<00:02:47.420> them<00:02:48.460> dynamic<00:02:49.460> cakes<00:02:50.290> so<00:02:53.420> flick

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:53.660 
give them dynamic cakes so flick

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:58.620 
give them dynamic cakes so flick

wheel<00:03:17.940> suspension<00:03:18.210> I<00:03:18.720> was<00:03:18.930> wondering<00:03:19.260> I<00:03:19.470> knew

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:20.070 
wheel suspension I was wondering I knew

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:24.140 
wheel suspension I was wondering I knew
there<00:03:20.250> was<00:03:20.340> something<00:03:20.550> wrong<00:03:22.700> not<00:03:23.700> what<00:03:24.120> I

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
there was something wrong not what I

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:27.890 
there was something wrong not what I
really<00:03:24.510> want<00:03:26.270> connector<00:03:27.270> is<00:03:27.480> wheel

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:27.900 
really want connector is wheel

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:36.050 
really want connector is wheel
suspension<00:03:28.140> I<00:03:30.680> rotate<00:03:31.820> okay<00:03:34.790> okay<00:03:35.790> then<00:03:35.940> I

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.060 
suspension I rotate okay okay then I

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:39.200 
suspension I rotate okay okay then I
need<00:03:36.090> agrees<00:03:37.760> there<00:03:38.760> we<00:03:38.850> go

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:39.210 
need agrees there we go

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:42.530 
need agrees there we go
I<00:03:40.190> think<00:03:41.190> I'm<00:03:41.280> just<00:03:41.400> gonna<00:03:41.520> move<00:03:41.820> this<00:03:42.090> down<00:03:42.480> a

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:21.280 
so yeah you know never one just to make

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:26.120 
so yeah you know never one just to make
this<00:04:21.459> quicker<00:04:23.370> not<00:04:24.370> gonna<00:04:24.580> do<00:04:24.789> that

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:26.130 
this quicker not gonna do that

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:29.640 
this quicker not gonna do that
you<00:04:27.130> know<00:04:27.190> same<00:04:27.400> gonna<00:04:27.550> rotate<00:04:27.850> this<00:04:28.530> it's<00:04:29.530> on

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:29.650

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:31.930 
the opposite side I don't know if that

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:34.860 
the opposite side I don't know if that
makes<00:04:32.080> a<00:04:32.169> difference<00:04:33.510> probably<00:04:34.510> should<00:04:34.780> know

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:34.870
