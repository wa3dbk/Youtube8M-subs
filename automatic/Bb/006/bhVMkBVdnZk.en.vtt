00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430 
alright guys so at first I started

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:52.150 
alright guys so at first I started
recording<00:02:49.880> with<00:02:50.300> fraps<00:02:50.660> however<00:02:51.380> I<00:02:51.500> felt<00:02:51.980> like

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:52.160 
recording with fraps however I felt like

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:55.060 
recording with fraps however I felt like
the<00:02:52.370> game<00:02:52.580> was<00:02:52.790> lying<00:02:53.120> with<00:02:53.420> fraps<00:02:53.830> maybe<00:02:54.830> it

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:55.070 
the game was lying with fraps maybe it

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:58.660 
the game was lying with fraps maybe it
was<00:02:55.250> just<00:02:55.280> because<00:02:55.970> I<00:02:56.360> was<00:02:56.390> recording<00:02:56.900> and<00:02:57.670> it

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:58.670 
was just because I was recording and it

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:00.880 
was just because I was recording and it
seems<00:02:58.940> that<00:02:59.060> the<00:02:59.360> video<00:02:59.750> to<00:02:59.840> actually<00:03:00.620> turned

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:00.890 
seems that the video to actually turned

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:04.540 
seems that the video to actually turned
out<00:03:01.040> well<00:03:01.430> but<00:03:02.330> I<00:03:02.540> decided<00:03:03.110> to<00:03:03.470> stop<00:03:04.340> recording

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:04.550 
out well but I decided to stop recording

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:06.340 
out well but I decided to stop recording
with<00:03:04.970> fraps<00:03:05.240> and<00:03:05.540> put<00:03:05.690> the<00:03:05.840> game<00:03:06.020> in<00:03:06.050> to

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:06.350 
with fraps and put the game in to

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:08.380 
with fraps and put the game in to
windowed<00:03:06.740> mode<00:03:06.980> and<00:03:07.280> record<00:03:07.730> with<00:03:07.880> Camtasia

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:08.390 
windowed mode and record with Camtasia

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:10.960 
windowed mode and record with Camtasia
and<00:03:08.810> I'm<00:03:09.770> sure<00:03:10.070> that<00:03:10.250> you<00:03:10.370> guys<00:03:10.550> know<00:03:10.940> that

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:10.970 
and I'm sure that you guys know that

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:14.200 
and I'm sure that you guys know that
games<00:03:11.810> run<00:03:12.140> better<00:03:12.380> in<00:03:12.650> full<00:03:12.920> screen<00:03:13.310> so<00:03:14.000> the

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:14.210 
games run better in full screen so the

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:16.000 
games run better in full screen so the
fact<00:03:14.480> that<00:03:14.570> i'm<00:03:14.750> recording<00:03:15.290> with<00:03:15.440> camtasia

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:16.010 
fact that i'm recording with camtasia

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:18.940 
fact that i'm recording with camtasia
and<00:03:16.430> running<00:03:17.000> in<00:03:17.090> window<00:03:17.390> mode<00:03:17.560> means<00:03:18.560> that

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:18.950 
and running in window mode means that

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:21.790 
and running in window mode means that
it's<00:03:19.280> running<00:03:19.850> pretty<00:03:19.880> well<00:03:20.320> also<00:03:21.320> will<00:03:21.620> keep

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:21.800 
it's running pretty well also will keep

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:24.460 
it's running pretty well also will keep
fraps<00:03:22.160> on<00:03:22.400> so<00:03:22.640> that<00:03:22.790> you<00:03:22.910> can<00:03:23.090> look<00:03:23.690> at<00:03:23.870> the<00:03:23.990> FPS

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:24.470 
fraps on so that you can look at the FPS

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:28.960 
fraps on so that you can look at the FPS
with<00:03:24.740> me<00:03:24.920> and<00:03:26.050> just<00:03:27.050> disclaimer<00:03:27.740> my<00:03:28.310> GPU<00:03:28.940> is

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:28.970 
with me and just disclaimer my GPU is

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:34.090 
with me and just disclaimer my GPU is
not<00:03:29.600> overclocked<00:03:30.550> and<00:03:32.410> also<00:03:33.410> my<00:03:33.680> native

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:34.100 
not overclocked and also my native

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:38.530 
not overclocked and also my native
screen<00:03:34.459> resolution<00:03:35.120> is<00:03:35.240> 1366<00:03:35.930> x<00:03:36.709> 768<00:03:37.540> which

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:38.540 
screen resolution is 1366 x 768 which

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:40.870 
screen resolution is 1366 x 768 which
means<00:03:38.840> that<00:03:38.959> if<00:03:39.290> your<00:03:39.470> screen<00:03:39.830> is<00:03:39.980> 1080p<00:03:40.520> you

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:40.880 
means that if your screen is 1080p you

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:42.970 
means that if your screen is 1080p you
may<00:03:41.060> have<00:03:41.330> lower<00:03:41.540> performance<00:03:42.290> than<00:03:42.530> me<00:03:42.709> so

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:42.980 
may have lower performance than me so

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:45.120 
may have lower performance than me so
you<00:03:43.040> may<00:03:43.280> have<00:03:43.310> to<00:03:43.550> play<00:03:43.880> on<00:03:44.030> lower<00:03:44.209> settings

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:45.130 
you may have to play on lower settings

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:47.500 
you may have to play on lower settings
the<00:03:46.130> settings<00:03:46.550> in<00:03:46.700> the<00:03:46.820> description<00:03:47.360> of<00:03:47.480> this
