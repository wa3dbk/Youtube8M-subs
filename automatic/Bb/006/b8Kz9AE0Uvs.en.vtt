00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:13.769
 hello friends what to say 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:16.020
 30 thousand I happened today in the morning 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:19.440
 went there 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:23.610
 turned on the computer and it was already more of us 

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:26.820
 30 years old and when I went to bed it was without 

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:31.160
 five people thirty thousand 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:33.150
 In general, such a century is good and I think that 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:35.350
 it's like responsibility for us 

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:37.480
 a big 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:39.219
 well what's the meaning of what to say and 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:42.989
 trusts so many people will start 

00:00:39.219 --> 00:00:47.690
 match not let and i 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:49.070
 back to our idea 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:51.710
 contests 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:53.720
 and the only thing is that we are a little different 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:56.270
 will we do it we have a reason for 

00:00:53.720 --> 00:01:02.690
 contest for quiz for prizes yes here 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:04.760
 our 30 1000 subscribers but if earlier 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:09.080
 we got a number of prizes there 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:11.270
 up to 40 and it's not even in the price there flags 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:14.690
 there is a dozen flag 15 dollars to send 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:17.300
 but it just takes a lot of effort 

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:19.640
 to gather information there she is 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:22.250
 returns there is something else you thought 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:25.390
 what will we do otherwise will we do 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:29.140
 prizes are few and prizes themselves are expensive 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:31.820
 so that's just been less 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:35.210
 organizational hassle and to themselves 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:38.660
 prizes which were more joyful 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:42.070
 therefore, as such a seed 

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:42.070
 I suggest 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:48.100
 speak out about how what 

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:50.810
 competitive announce me honestly 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:53.870
 no such idea actually this 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:56.690
 last competition where we spoke 

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:59.870
 send your videos and there these videos 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:01.940
 It was so a thing under 40 that in general, too 

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:05.180
 quite some kind of buy 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:05.720
 I don't know what to do 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:08.330
 such a 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:11.270
 that is, a competition that does not require 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:13.400
 some kind of titanic administrative 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:18.410
 effort but at the same time enough 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:22.400
 creative and but such a cap is interesting 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:25.370
 It was and those who are involved and those who 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:28.880
 looks at the result here I have 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:32.959
 since there are no ideas, I kind of declare 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:35.420
 competition for competition means who 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:38.870
 will come up with the competition that will be 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:40.459
 the breeze will be good 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:41.480
 there will be a competition itself there will be more 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:46.180
 several prizes 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:48.959
 so here I congratulate all of us on 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:52.959
 this anniversary encore happy new year and 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:56.469

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:59.560

00:02:56.469 --> 00:03:03.910
 all the practices that are 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:06.390
 all this is all good and bright so i 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:07.740
