00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
to the minifigures we're gonna go ahead

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.080 
to the minifigures we're gonna go ahead
and<00:00:50.610> start<00:00:50.820> with<00:00:50.910> the<00:00:51.000> commando<00:00:51.680> droid<00:00:53.090> I

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
and start with the commando droid I

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.260 
and start with the commando droid I
really<00:00:55.020> really<00:00:55.890> really<00:00:56.430> wish<00:00:56.789> they<00:00:57.090> had<00:00:57.239> a

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
really really really wish they had a

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.020 
really really really wish they had a
black<00:00:57.570> one<00:00:57.840> instead<00:00:58.199> of<00:00:58.260> a<00:00:58.379> brown<00:00:58.710> one<00:00:58.920> I<00:00:59.160> just

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
black one instead of a brown one I just

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.490 
black one instead of a brown one I just
think<00:01:00.180> the<00:01:00.270> brown<00:01:00.420> looks<00:01:00.719> weird<00:01:00.960> it's<00:01:01.350> like<00:01:01.469> a

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
think the brown looks weird it's like a

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.609 
think the brown looks weird it's like a
chocolate<00:01:01.980> brown<00:01:02.870> and<00:01:03.870> we<00:01:04.049> all<00:01:04.229> know<00:01:04.439> it's

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
chocolate brown and we all know it's

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.429 
chocolate brown and we all know it's
more<00:01:04.830> accurate<00:01:05.070> but<00:01:06.000> when<00:01:06.720> it<00:01:06.810> comes<00:01:07.020> down<00:01:07.229> to

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
more accurate but when it comes down to

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:11.510 
more accurate but when it comes down to
it<00:01:09.170> accuracy<00:01:10.170> we<00:01:10.380> could<00:01:10.530> care<00:01:10.710> less<00:01:10.740> if<00:01:11.189> black

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
it accuracy we could care less if black

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.520 
it accuracy we could care less if black
looks<00:01:11.790> better<00:01:12.000> we<00:01:12.240> want<00:01:12.450> black<00:01:12.689> I'll<00:01:13.200> tell<00:01:13.439> you

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
looks better we want black I'll tell you

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.330 
looks better we want black I'll tell you
the<00:01:13.590> truth<00:01:15.290> you<00:01:16.290> do<00:01:16.439> get<00:01:16.619> them<00:01:16.860> they're<00:01:17.189> the

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
the truth you do get them they're the

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.260 
the truth you do get them they're the
same<00:01:17.520> on<00:01:17.580> both<00:01:19.520> they're<00:01:20.520> both<00:01:20.670> exactly<00:01:21.000> the

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
same on both they're both exactly the

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.289 
same on both they're both exactly the
same<00:01:22.369> they<00:01:23.369> did<00:01:23.520> a<00:01:23.549> very<00:01:23.729> good<00:01:23.909> job<00:01:23.970> on<00:01:24.240> the

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
same they did a very good job on the

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.570 
same they did a very good job on the
head<00:01:24.450> I<00:01:24.689> think<00:01:25.409> that's<00:01:25.680> the<00:01:25.799> only<00:01:25.830> like<00:01:26.159> Jewish

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
head I think that's the only like Jewish

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.140 
head I think that's the only like Jewish
thing<00:01:27.000> they<00:01:27.180> actually<00:01:27.509> made<00:01:27.930> like<00:01:29.150> everything

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
thing they actually made like everything

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:31.340 
thing they actually made like everything
else<00:01:30.240> they<00:01:30.450> had<00:01:30.630> they<00:01:30.810> just<00:01:30.840> had<00:01:31.079> to<00:01:31.170> change

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
else they had they just had to change

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.530 
else they had they just had to change
colors<00:01:31.740> a<00:01:31.829> little<00:01:31.920> bit<00:01:33.470> then<00:01:34.470> we<00:01:34.590> have<00:01:34.829> the

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:35.540 
colors a little bit then we have the

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:40.450 
colors a little bit then we have the
I'll<00:01:36.540> show<00:01:36.810> you<00:01:36.900> the<00:01:37.340> earth<00:01:38.340> tripper<00:01:39.170> China

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:40.460 
I'll show you the earth tripper China

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:46.190 
I'll show you the earth tripper China
does<00:01:41.460> have<00:01:41.640> a<00:01:41.960> sweet-ass<00:01:42.960> helmet<00:01:43.500> though<00:01:45.200> is

does have a sweet-ass helmet though is

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:55.200 
does have a sweet-ass helmet though is
this<00:01:46.470> really<00:01:46.890> as<00:01:46.979> a<00:01:47.009> sick<00:01:47.340> helmet

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:55.210 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:58.300 

all<00:01:56.210> right<00:01:56.380> spec<00:01:57.380> to<00:01:57.500> the<00:01:57.590> helmet<00:01:57.979> I<00:01:58.100> mean

00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:58.310 
all right spec to the helmet I mean

all right spec to the helmet I mean
really<00:01:58.610> the<00:01:58.850> only<00:01:58.880> thing<00:01:59.150> on<00:01:59.270> this<00:01:59.420> is<00:01:59.570> the

00:01:59.679 --> 00:01:59.689 
really the only thing on this is the

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:01.870 
really the only thing on this is the
helmet<00:01:59.990> again<00:02:00.290> like<00:02:00.470> last<00:02:00.500> year<00:02:01.009> got<00:02:01.759> the

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:01.880 
helmet again like last year got the

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:04.300 
helmet again like last year got the
plain<00:02:02.060> body<00:02:02.360> it<00:02:02.570> just<00:02:02.780> has<00:02:02.930> red<00:02:03.140> arms<00:02:03.409> it<00:02:04.130> has<00:02:04.280> a

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:04.310 
plain body it just has red arms it has a

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:10.779 
plain body it just has red arms it has a
sig<00:02:04.820> helmet<00:02:08.800> the<00:02:09.800> helmets<00:02:10.190> are<00:02:10.310> getting<00:02:10.550> nice

00:02:10.779 --> 00:02:10.789 
sig helmet the helmets are getting nice

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:15.780 
sig helmet the helmets are getting nice
though<00:02:11.120> I<00:02:11.360> must<00:02:11.540> say<00:02:12.280> and<00:02:13.280> then<00:02:14.000> we<00:02:14.180> have<00:02:14.420> the

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:15.790 
though I must say and then we have the

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:18.010 
though I must say and then we have the
highly<00:02:16.790> and<00:02:17.120> I<00:02:17.390> think<00:02:17.600> this<00:02:17.690> is<00:02:17.810> most

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:18.020 
highly and I think this is most

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:20.380 
highly and I think this is most
anticipated<00:02:18.319> figure<00:02:18.920> of<00:02:19.130> 2012<00:02:19.790> it's<00:02:20.000> the<00:02:20.120> arc

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:20.390 
anticipated figure of 2012 it's the arc

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:24.460 
anticipated figure of 2012 it's the arc
trooper<00:02:21.050> a<00:02:21.080> RC<00:02:21.560> not<00:02:21.830> a<00:02:22.010> RF<00:02:22.310> now<00:02:23.239> a<00:02:23.600> lot<00:02:24.350> of

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:24.470 
trooper a RC not a RF now a lot of

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:25.780 
trooper a RC not a RF now a lot of
people<00:02:24.739> have<00:02:24.830> been<00:02:24.950> anticipating<00:02:25.670> this

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:25.790 
people have been anticipating this

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:27.820 
people have been anticipating this
figure<00:02:26.420> and<00:02:26.510> saying<00:02:26.720> it<00:02:27.019> is<00:02:27.140> better<00:02:27.350> than<00:02:27.680> you

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:27.830 
figure and saying it is better than you

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:30.580 
figure and saying it is better than you
Boba<00:02:28.250> Fett<00:02:28.550> from<00:02:29.090> it<00:02:29.720> I<00:02:29.959> mean<00:02:30.080> it's<00:02:30.260> the<00:02:30.380> best

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:30.590 
Boba Fett from it I mean it's the best

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:33.640 
Boba Fett from it I mean it's the best
figure<00:02:31.069> since<00:02:31.340> the<00:02:31.550> Boba<00:02:31.880> Fett<00:02:32.510> from<00:02:32.750> the

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:33.650 
figure since the Boba Fett from the

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:36.160 
figure since the Boba Fett from the
sleeve<00:02:34.130> one<00:02:34.400> the<00:02:34.790> new<00:02:35.180> sleep<00:02:35.360> one<00:02:35.540> which<00:02:35.840> I<00:02:35.959> did

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:36.170 
sleeve one the new sleep one which I did

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:38.170 
sleeve one the new sleep one which I did
not<00:02:36.319> get<00:02:36.440> my<00:02:36.560> hands<00:02:36.860> on<00:02:36.950> and<00:02:37.340> probably<00:02:37.880> won't

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.180 
not get my hands on and probably won't

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:40.420 
not get my hands on and probably won't
so<00:02:38.810> I<00:02:38.840> don't<00:02:39.080> know<00:02:39.200> what<00:02:39.739> the<00:02:39.890> difference<00:02:40.010> is

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:40.430 
so I don't know what the difference is

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:43.059 
so I don't know what the difference is
but<00:02:41.209> I<00:02:41.269> must<00:02:41.480> say<00:02:41.600> this<00:02:41.780> figure<00:02:42.080> is<00:02:42.140> absolutely

00:02:43.059 --> 00:02:43.069 
but I must say this figure is absolutely

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:44.020 
but I must say this figure is absolutely
amazing

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:44.030 
amazing

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:47.020 
amazing
they<00:02:44.870> put<00:02:45.080> feet<00:02:45.769> printing<00:02:46.190> leg<00:02:46.580> printing

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:47.030 
they put feet printing leg printing

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:53.030 
printing on if they added arm printing

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:54.699 
printing on if they added arm printing
this<00:02:53.209> would<00:02:53.360> be<00:02:53.480> the<00:02:53.630> best<00:02:53.870> figure<00:02:54.200> of<00:02:54.500> all

00:02:54.699 --> 00:02:54.709 
this would be the best figure of all

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:57.130 
this would be the best figure of all
time<00:02:55.010> and<00:02:55.910> they<00:02:56.030> are<00:02:56.060> back<00:02:56.239> friendly<00:02:56.570> they

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:58.730 
have so much renting on this it's not

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:01.720 
have so much renting on this it's not
even<00:02:58.940> funny<00:03:00.100> but<00:03:01.100> let's<00:03:01.220> go<00:03:01.400> ahead<00:03:01.430> and<00:03:01.640> just

on to the Canon which is the feature of

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:50.300 
on to the Canon which is the feature of
the<00:03:48.660> set<00:03:48.900> go<00:03:49.470> ahead<00:03:49.740> and<00:03:49.830> show<00:03:49.950> you<00:03:50.040> a<00:03:50.070> box

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:50.310 
the set go ahead and show you a box

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:52.970 
the set go ahead and show you a box
after<00:03:50.790> I<00:03:50.820> do<00:03:50.910> all<00:03:50.970> this<00:03:51.210> on<00:03:51.450> the<00:03:52.170> Canon<00:03:52.650> looks

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:52.980 
after I do all this on the Canon looks

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:55.670 
after I do all this on the Canon looks
quite<00:03:53.550> nice<00:03:54.000> I<00:03:54.330> must<00:03:54.480> say<00:03:54.780> it's<00:03:55.380> a<00:03:55.410> little<00:03:55.590> bit

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:55.680 
quite nice I must say it's a little bit

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:59.420 
quite nice I must say it's a little bit
stubby<00:03:56.130> small<00:03:56.700> I<00:03:56.970> guess<00:03:57.180> not<00:03:58.020> much<00:03:58.350> else<00:03:58.650> the

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430 
stubby small I guess not much else the

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:03.260 
stubby small I guess not much else the
clear<00:03:59.730> piece<00:03:59.940> is<00:04:00.150> to<00:04:00.330> hold<00:04:00.570> it<00:04:00.690> up<00:04:02.030> to<00:04:03.030> support

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:03.270 
clear piece is to hold it up to support

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:05.300 
clear piece is to hold it up to support
it<00:04:03.420> I<00:04:03.510> mean<00:04:03.630> it<00:04:03.780> can<00:04:04.020> go<00:04:04.290> without<00:04:04.560> it<00:04:04.620> but<00:04:05.160> it's

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:05.310 
it I mean it can go without it but it's

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:07.640 
it I mean it can go without it but it's
not<00:04:05.700> nearly<00:04:06.210> as<00:04:06.390> support<00:04:06.930> us<00:04:07.110> a<00:04:07.290> little<00:04:07.440> bit

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:07.650 
not nearly as support us a little bit

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:10.610 
not nearly as support us a little bit
more<00:04:08.060> flimsy<00:04:09.060> it's<00:04:09.540> not<00:04:09.720> that<00:04:09.960> much<00:04:10.140> flimsier

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:10.620 
more flimsy it's not that much flimsier

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:12.470 
more flimsy it's not that much flimsier
so<00:04:10.860> I<00:04:10.890> don't<00:04:11.100> even<00:04:11.190> know<00:04:11.430> why<00:04:11.610> they<00:04:11.790> did<00:04:12.000> that<00:04:12.030> I

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:12.480 
so I don't even know why they did that I

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:15.080 
so I don't even know why they did that I
guess<00:04:13.110> if<00:04:13.260> a<00:04:13.290> little<00:04:13.530> kids<00:04:13.680> going<00:04:13.860> mmm

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:15.090 
guess if a little kids going mmm

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:17.690 
guess if a little kids going mmm
it's<00:04:15.780> gonna<00:04:15.930> collapse<00:04:16.680> in<00:04:17.100> on<00:04:17.190> itself<00:04:17.250> and

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:17.700 
it's gonna collapse in on itself and

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:20.600 
it's gonna collapse in on itself and
break<00:04:17.910> yeah<00:04:18.209> which<00:04:18.870> would<00:04:18.959> not<00:04:19.140> be<00:04:19.170> it<00:04:19.520> so<00:04:20.520> as

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:20.610 
break yeah which would not be it so as

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:22.550 
break yeah which would not be it so as
usual<00:04:20.760> go<00:04:21.299> ahead<00:04:21.450> and<00:04:21.570> take<00:04:21.690> the<00:04:21.870> are<00:04:22.110> chipper

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:22.560 
usual go ahead and take the are chipper

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:26.150 
usual go ahead and take the are chipper
and<00:04:23.190> you<00:04:24.030> can<00:04:24.240> put<00:04:24.540> him<00:04:24.810> in<00:04:25.050> the<00:04:25.170> cockpit<00:04:25.860> or

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:26.160 
and you can put him in the cockpit or

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:29.980 
and you can put him in the cockpit or
