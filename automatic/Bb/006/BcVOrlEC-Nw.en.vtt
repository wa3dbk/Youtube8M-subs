 er 

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:37.720

 It's actually a cup and political society. 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:43.890
 You had a lot of sayings about Never Never when you put your pants on. 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:48.940
 The ball in the hole 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:54.820
 If it is short, it never enters. 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:57.100
 So long , I've heard a lot of things like this. 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:01:01.690
 I 'll show you a few things by hand. 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:03.270
 Now that my body is not'll Rail Short Inside Look For How to create it 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:07.290

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:12.060
 Okay, see how the ball does not go too short now 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:18.180
 If I go a little Yes I passed the muzzle of the hole cup 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:23.659
 For the past 02 why not just deuleogajyo my insurance Hall seems my nose area 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:28.049
 Properly baked past the hole shell in its uncontrolled state 

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:30.990
 If you do not come out of the Constitution, you will pass through the hole cup. 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:35.850
 I've passed reinserting 0 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:37.170
 I do not want to do that. 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:43.229
 Because of 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:46.800
 I do not go into my friendship for a long time because I think of my underwear. 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:53.819
 Yeah. It's hard to put it in second. 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:58.409
 For John, let's just do this, why can not chair the hole cup is about 10cm 

00:01:53.819 --> 00:02:03.780
 Yes, but my insurance Nobel dream is now 0 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:07.259
 Even if it is only a position, it is all this way. 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:11.220
 Ditto, if you do not mind, run away. 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:14.879
 Eventually, though, when viewed as a whole right will hold examples 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:18.780
 Then I'll have exactly 0 correctly 

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:23.250
 Beans, etc. The above are all examples denied 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:28.040
 Going to go away turning tool away a glass of water 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:28.040
 Backstroke hardening and so on or over 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:36.570
 The Palace that was condemned next to the hall 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:40.770
 If half succeeded, half of it would be all falling apart. 

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:43.920
 For example, recommended by gravity did away 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:50.720
 Yes. All right. All Evans. 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:55.430
 Creating falling Otto van did you end up using the hole cup to the brain about the size examples 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:59.989
 Would you like to use a small Klong call cup with a probability of 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:07.489
 Or would you like to use one cup? 

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:10.210
 The obvious conclusion to Ball No. 1 out of Never Never too nan attachment hole cock 

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:16.180
 The Fugitive 10005 

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:17.800
 Fine so I thought I'd put a hole cup cups around the hole and hit all Zebbug on Fire 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:23.740
 It falls into the hole cup. 

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:29.950
 In the end I use my visible resource hall cups 

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:32.860
 Butler putting on a cupper team is using a big cup. 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:36.190
 Your choice is yours 

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:41.170
 For many people, leaving the two did the will you choose 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:44.320
 I will always try to stick to the holder's state . 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:49.150
 Attachment putting is just black 

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:49.420
 This is why you can be right back in the second because you stay like this 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:53.800
 That's it. 

00:03:49.420 --> 00:04:00.280
 Because Pak easily say there is no dew putting 

00:03:53.800 --> 00:04:01.210
 In my example of the example round, I constantly suffer from three-button pressure 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:08.170
 I can not help it. 

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:11.200
 I do not like too much of it. Yeah . 

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:16.989
 Putting on chip shot all over cover 

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:23.520
 2 putting maxi bar. It's always good . 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:23.520
 Yes, you should always put the putt on the hole cup.
