00:04:19.089 --> 00:04:19.099 
are brilliant thing it it fixes itself

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:21.580 
are brilliant thing it it fixes itself
and<00:04:19.549> if<00:04:19.760> you<00:04:19.880> put<00:04:20.180> in<00:04:20.299> the<00:04:20.419> work<00:04:20.630> you<00:04:21.169> can<00:04:21.349> you
