feathers a nice variety of fall colors
we<00:00:38.160> always<00:00:38.399> recommend<00:00:38.700> using<00:00:39.030> light<00:00:39.360> colors

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
we always recommend using light colors

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.020 
we always recommend using light colors
first<00:00:39.989> and<00:00:40.320> then<00:00:40.530> dark<00:00:40.800> colors<00:00:41.190> this<00:00:41.969> is

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
first and then dark colors this is

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:43.850 
first and then dark colors this is
because<00:00:42.450> the<00:00:42.629> darker<00:00:42.960> colors<00:00:43.230> will<00:00:43.410> cover<00:00:43.649> up

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
because the darker colors will cover up

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.520 
because the darker colors will cover up
the<00:00:43.890> lighter<00:00:44.190> colors<00:00:44.579> so<00:00:45.050> yellow<00:00:46.050> is<00:00:46.260> first
