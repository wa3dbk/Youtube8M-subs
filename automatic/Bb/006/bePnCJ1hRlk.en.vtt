and<00:04:41.289> it<00:04:41.500> will<00:04:41.590> crash<00:04:41.860> and<00:04:42.190> not<00:04:42.460> work<00:04:42.990> so<00:04:43.990> the

00:04:44.249 --> 00:04:44.259 
and it will crash and not work so the

00:04:44.259 --> 00:04:46.800

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:23.129 
get everything right but basically what
we<00:05:20.979> did<00:05:21.130> is<00:05:21.340> we<00:05:21.400> took<00:05:21.669> away<00:05:22.150> three<00:05:22.479> sets<00:05:22.720> and<00:05:23.020> we

00:05:23.129 --> 00:05:23.139 
we did is we took away three sets and we

00:05:23.139 --> 00:05:25.379 
we did is we took away three sets and we
put<00:05:23.349> back<00:05:23.530> three<00:05:23.919> and<00:05:24.099> these<00:05:24.759> things<00:05:25.120> need<00:05:25.330> to

00:05:25.379 --> 00:05:25.389 
put back three and these things need to

00:05:25.389 --> 00:05:29.010 
put back three and these things need to
be<00:05:25.509> changed<00:05:26.280> so<00:05:27.280> that<00:05:27.310> they<00:05:27.789> are<00:05:28.090> those

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:29.020 
be changed so that they are those

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:35.279 
be changed so that they are those
numbers<00:05:29.520> the<00:05:30.520> file<00:05:30.880> save<00:05:31.870> as<00:05:32.110> and<00:05:33.720> save<00:05:34.720> it<00:05:35.139> as

00:05:35.279 --> 00:05:35.289 
numbers the file save as and save it as

00:05:35.289 --> 00:05:44.070 
numbers the file save as and save it as
a<00:05:37.349> mdl<00:05:40.830> 06<00:05:41.830> or<00:05:42.159> whatever<00:05:42.520> and<00:05:42.789> now<00:05:43.479> again<00:05:43.720> this

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:44.080 
a mdl 06 or whatever and now again this

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:46.020 
a mdl 06 or whatever and now again this
only<00:05:44.260> saves<00:05:44.590> us<00:05:44.740> all<00:05:44.889> files<00:05:45.250> because<00:05:45.580> almost

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:46.030 
only saves us all files because almost

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:48.149 
only saves us all files because almost
every<00:05:46.419> file<00:05:46.599> can<00:05:46.900> be<00:05:46.930> opening<00:05:47.440> the<00:05:47.590> hex<00:05:47.770> editor

00:05:48.149 --> 00:05:48.159 
every file can be opening the hex editor

00:05:48.159 --> 00:05:52.520 
every file can be opening the hex editor
almost<00:05:48.880> everything<00:05:49.180> is<00:05:49.270> made<00:05:49.389> out<00:05:49.539> of<00:05:49.570> hex<00:05:51.330> dot

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:52.530 
almost everything is made out of hex dot

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:58.379 
almost everything is made out of hex dot
BR<00:05:53.530> dar<00:05:53.800> es<00:05:55.500> save<00:05:56.500> all<00:05:56.919> those<00:05:57.760> red<00:05:57.970> things<00:05:58.000> went

BR dar es save all those red things went
away<00:05:58.449> now<00:05:59.050> we<00:05:59.110> can<00:05:59.320> close<00:05:59.500> x<00:05:59.770> for<00:06:00.039> the<00:06:00.099> time

away now we can close x for the time

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:05.570 
away now we can close x for the time

now<00:06:06.580> remember<00:06:06.820> how<00:06:07.030> when<00:06:07.150> we<00:06:07.240> want<00:06:07.479> to<00:06:07.659> preview

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:08.020 
now remember how when we want to preview

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:10.529 
now remember how when we want to preview
that<00:06:08.349> model<00:06:08.770> it<00:06:08.949> crashed<00:06:09.310> right<00:06:10.270> click

00:06:10.529 --> 00:06:10.539 
that model it crashed right click

00:06:10.539 --> 00:06:17.100 
that model it crashed right click
preview<00:06:11.699> it<00:06:12.699> will<00:06:12.820> still<00:06:13.060> crash<00:06:14.430> but<00:06:15.990> look<00:06:16.990> at

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:17.110 
preview it will still crash but look at

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:25.310 
preview it will still crash but look at
that<00:06:18.570> you<00:06:19.570> now<00:06:19.690> have<00:06:19.720> the<00:06:19.870> bones<00:06:22.680> pretty<00:06:23.680> sweet

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:25.320 
that you now have the bones pretty sweet

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:28.379 
that you now have the bones pretty sweet
let<00:06:26.320> me<00:06:26.440> open<00:06:26.590> this<00:06:26.919> this<00:06:27.669> is<00:06:27.849> the<00:06:27.940> important

00:06:28.379 --> 00:06:28.389 
let me open this this is the important

00:06:28.389 --> 00:06:30.000 
let me open this this is the important
part<00:06:28.419> right<00:06:28.599> here<00:06:28.750> not<00:06:29.380> really<00:06:29.650> that<00:06:29.770> we<00:06:29.889> can

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:30.010 
part right here not really that we can

00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:32.279 
part right here not really that we can
preview<00:06:30.370> it<00:06:30.490> but<00:06:31.240> we<00:06:31.360> can<00:06:31.570> now<00:06:31.780> we<00:06:31.840> actually

00:06:32.279 --> 00:06:32.289 
preview it but we can now we actually

00:06:32.289 --> 00:06:34.620 
preview it but we can now we actually
see<00:06:32.440> something<00:06:32.800> that<00:06:33.190> we<00:06:33.430> can<00:06:33.550> open<00:06:33.729> this<00:06:34.000> we

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:34.630 
see something that we can open this we

00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:36.750 
see something that we can open this we
can<00:06:34.779> find<00:06:35.080> all<00:06:35.289> of<00:06:35.320> these<00:06:35.560> things<00:06:35.889> this<00:06:36.550> is<00:06:36.700> the

00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:36.760 
can find all of these things this is the

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:38.399 
can find all of these things this is the
most<00:06:36.880> important<00:06:37.270> part<00:06:37.300> because<00:06:38.050> on<00:06:38.139> our<00:06:38.229> next

00:06:38.399 --> 00:06:38.409 
most important part because on our next

00:06:38.409 --> 00:06:39.580 
most important part because on our next
tutorial<00:06:38.529> will<00:06:39.070> need<00:06:39.250> to<00:06:39.400> be

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:39.590 
tutorial will need to be

00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:43.990 
tutorial will need to be
hexing<00:06:40.010> the<00:06:40.310> materials<00:06:42.670> what<00:06:43.670> we're<00:06:43.820> going<00:06:43.910> to
