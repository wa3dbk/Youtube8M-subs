your rear suspension the most important
thing<00:00:04.110> to<00:00:04.200> do<00:00:04.319> first<00:00:04.799> is<00:00:05.009> make<00:00:05.220> sure<00:00:05.250> your

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:05.850 
thing to do first is make sure your

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:06.980 
thing to do first is make sure your
spring<00:00:06.120> rates<00:00:06.270> correct<00:00:06.540> that<00:00:06.720> you're<00:00:06.839> getting

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:06.990 
spring rates correct that you're getting

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:08.810 
spring rates correct that you're getting
the<00:00:07.140> right<00:00:07.170> amount<00:00:07.500> of<00:00:07.560> sag<00:00:07.799> and<00:00:08.040> that<00:00:08.700> you're

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:08.820 
the right amount of sag and that you're

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:10.129 
the right amount of sag and that you're
consistently<00:00:09.360> bottoming<00:00:09.809> out<00:00:09.900> your

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:10.139 
consistently bottoming out your

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:12.950 
consistently bottoming out your
suspension<00:00:10.590> unit<00:00:11.059> then<00:00:12.059> from<00:00:12.360> there<00:00:12.540> you<00:00:12.750> sort

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
suspension unit then from there you sort

of tweak the settings of the damper you

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:16.519 
of tweak the settings of the damper you

your<00:00:58.440> fork<00:00:58.680> is<00:00:58.800> coming<00:00:59.160> back<00:00:59.309> quick<00:00:59.760> and

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
your fork is coming back quick and

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.479 
your fork is coming back quick and
quickly<00:01:00.390> enough<00:01:00.649> that<00:01:01.649> you<00:01:01.920> know<00:01:02.039> you're<00:01:02.280> not

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
quickly enough that you know you're not

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.579 
quickly enough that you know you're not
that<00:01:03.180> you're<00:01:03.329> getting<00:01:03.510> most<00:01:03.989> of<00:01:04.110> the<00:01:04.170> travel

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
that you're getting most of the travel

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.700 
that you're getting most of the travel
that<00:01:04.799> you<00:01:04.860> need<00:01:05.100> between<00:01:05.810> between<00:01:06.810> bumps<00:01:07.229> but

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
that you need between between bumps but

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.770 
that you need between between bumps but
not<00:01:07.830> so<00:01:08.100> slowly<00:01:08.490> that<00:01:08.760> when<00:01:09.240> you<00:01:09.330> hit<00:01:09.450> a<00:01:09.510> really

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
not so slowly that when you hit a really

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.560 
not so slowly that when you hit a really
big<00:01:10.080> hole<00:01:10.260> it<00:01:10.560> stays<00:01:10.830> in<00:01:10.979> the<00:01:11.070> hole<00:01:11.270> so<00:01:12.270> you<00:01:12.360> set

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
big hole it stays in the hole so you set

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.120 
big hole it stays in the hole so you set
your<00:01:12.600> rebound<00:01:12.990> first<00:01:13.260> and<00:01:13.530> then<00:01:13.979> your

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
your rebound first and then your

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.030 
your rebound first and then your
compression<00:01:14.640> damping<00:01:15.030> is<00:01:15.240> basically<00:01:16.040> the

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
compression damping is basically the

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.560 
compression damping is basically the
compression<00:01:17.460> damping<00:01:17.759> is<00:01:17.880> the<00:01:18.000> resistance<00:01:18.420> of

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
compression damping is the resistance of

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.469 
compression damping is the resistance of
the<00:01:18.659> fork<00:01:18.930> to<00:01:19.229> compression<00:01:20.240> which<00:01:21.240> makes

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
the fork to compression which makes

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:22.880 
the fork to compression which makes
sense<00:01:21.689> so<00:01:21.840> here<00:01:22.170> I<00:01:22.200> have<00:01:22.290> my<00:01:22.409> compression

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
sense so here I have my compression

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.499 
sense so here I have my compression
damping<00:01:23.130> turned<00:01:23.369> up<00:01:23.490> really<00:01:23.610> hard<00:01:23.850> you<00:01:24.479> can

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
damping turned up really hard you can

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.420 
damping turned up really hard you can
see<00:01:24.750> it's<00:01:24.869> really<00:01:25.110> you<00:01:25.830> know<00:01:25.860> pretty<00:01:26.100> hard<00:01:26.310> to

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
see it's really you know pretty hard to

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.370 
see it's really you know pretty hard to
compress<00:01:26.700> the<00:01:26.850> fork<00:01:27.090> and<00:01:27.270> as<00:01:27.420> I<00:01:27.450> turn<00:01:28.170> the

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
compress the fork and as I turn the

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.380 
compress the fork and as I turn the
compression<00:01:28.799> damping<00:01:29.100> to<00:01:29.670> a<00:01:29.700> lighter<00:01:30.000> setting

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
compression damping to a lighter setting

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.950 
compression damping to a lighter setting
makes<00:01:31.140> it<00:01:31.259> considerably<00:01:31.470> easier<00:01:31.890> to<00:01:32.960> compress

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
makes it considerably easier to compress

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.319 
makes it considerably easier to compress
the<00:01:34.110> fork<00:01:34.320> so<00:01:34.850> compression<00:01:35.850> damping<00:01:36.060> a<00:01:36.119> lot<00:01:36.240> of

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
the fork so compression damping a lot of

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.510 
the fork so compression damping a lot of
people<00:01:36.540> use<00:01:36.750> it<00:01:36.900> as<00:01:37.020> a<00:01:37.049> you<00:01:37.770> know<00:01:37.799> substitute

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
people use it as a you know substitute

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:39.740 
people use it as a you know substitute
for<00:01:38.670> the<00:01:38.759> right<00:01:38.850> spring<00:01:39.119> rate<00:01:39.299> you<00:01:39.479> don't<00:01:39.630> want

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
for the right spring rate you don't want

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:40.249 
for the right spring rate you don't want
to<00:01:39.810> do<00:01:39.930> that

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
to do that

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.260 
to do that
basically<00:01:40.920> what<00:01:41.220> compression<00:01:41.790> damping<00:01:42.060> does

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
basically what compression damping does

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.700 
basically what compression damping does
is<00:01:42.479> add<00:01:42.720> stability<00:01:43.350> to<00:01:43.500> the<00:01:43.619> fork<00:01:45.290> it<00:01:46.290> you<00:01:46.619> know

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
is add stability to the fork it you know

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.160 
is add stability to the fork it you know
it's<00:01:47.549> low<00:01:47.970> speed<00:01:48.299> compression<00:01:48.780> damping<00:01:49.049> so

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
it's low speed compression damping so

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.020 
it's low speed compression damping so
it's<00:01:49.290> more<00:01:49.439> like<00:01:49.590> gradual<00:01:50.220> undulations<00:01:50.700> and

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
it's more like gradual undulations and

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.100 
it's more like gradual undulations and
stuff<00:01:51.270> in<00:01:51.390> the<00:01:51.479> trail<00:01:51.689> when<00:01:51.899> you<00:01:51.990> hit

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
stuff in the trail when you hit

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.359 
stuff in the trail when you hit
something<00:01:52.290> really<00:01:52.590> hard<00:01:52.770> like<00:01:52.979> a<00:01:53.009> square

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
something really hard like a square

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:54.950 
something really hard like a square
edged<00:01:53.490> rock<00:01:53.790> you<00:01:54.600> don't<00:01:54.720> really<00:01:54.810> have

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
edged rock you don't really have

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.560 
edged rock you don't really have
adjustment<00:01:55.439> of<00:01:55.530> those<00:01:55.649> settings<00:01:56.009> so<00:01:56.939> you<00:01:57.390> know

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
adjustment of those settings so you know

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.480 
adjustment of those settings so you know
compression<00:01:58.350> damping<00:01:58.649> that's<00:01:58.829> somewhere<00:01:59.189> on

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
compression damping that's somewhere on

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.850 
compression damping that's somewhere on
the<00:01:59.729> lighter<00:01:59.969> end<00:02:00.210> of<00:02:00.299> things<00:02:00.619> low<00:02:01.619> speed

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
the lighter end of things low speed

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.539 
the lighter end of things low speed
compression<00:02:02.340> is<00:02:02.630> going<00:02:03.630> to<00:02:04.219> make<00:02:05.219> it<00:02:05.340> easier

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
compression is going to make it easier

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.130 
compression is going to make it easier
for<00:02:05.700> you<00:02:05.790> to<00:02:05.820> compress<00:02:06.180> your<00:02:06.360> bike<00:02:06.540> and<00:02:06.990> push

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
for you to compress your bike and push

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:08.990 
for you to compress your bike and push
it<00:02:07.259> around<00:02:07.350> and<00:02:07.680> stuff<00:02:07.829> like<00:02:07.979> that<00:02:08.220> and<00:02:08.429> a

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
it around and stuff like that and a

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.820 
it around and stuff like that and a
higher<00:02:09.209> setting<00:02:09.690> is<00:02:09.840> going<00:02:10.080> to<00:02:10.229> make<00:02:10.530> it<00:02:10.619> Bob

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
higher setting is going to make it Bob

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.309 
higher setting is going to make it Bob
less<00:02:11.099> and<00:02:11.520> probably<00:02:12.239> keep<00:02:12.420> you<00:02:12.750> know<00:02:12.870> your

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
less and probably keep you know your

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:13.880 
less and probably keep you know your
bike<00:02:13.410> a<00:02:13.440> little<00:02:13.680> bit

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
bike a little bit

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.410 
bike a little bit
stable<00:02:14.310> it's<00:02:14.400> gonna<00:02:14.520> be<00:02:14.670> less<00:02:14.790> likely<00:02:15.000> to<00:02:15.150> die

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
stable it's gonna be less likely to die

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.840 
stable it's gonna be less likely to die
I<00:02:15.780> prefer<00:02:16.440> setting<00:02:17.250> somewhere<00:02:17.520> in<00:02:17.580> the<00:02:17.640> middle

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:17.850 
I prefer setting somewhere in the middle

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:21.170 
I prefer setting somewhere in the middle
so<00:02:18.810> that's<00:02:19.319> you<00:02:20.100> know<00:02:20.160> the<00:02:20.340> basics<00:02:20.760> of<00:02:20.850> damper

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
so that's you know the basics of damper

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:25.280 
so that's you know the basics of damper
adjustment<00:02:21.720> on<00:02:22.050> your<00:02:22.280> bike
