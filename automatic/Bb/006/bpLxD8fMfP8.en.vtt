00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:05.460 
okay we're going to talk about how to

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:07.849 
okay we're going to talk about how to
remove<00:00:05.790> and<00:00:06.390> remount<00:00:06.779> your<00:00:07.200> bicycle<00:00:07.710> wheels

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:07.859 
remove and remount your bicycle wheels

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:11.450 
remove and remount your bicycle wheels
so<00:00:08.790> this<00:00:09.210> is<00:00:09.330> a<00:00:09.360> road<00:00:09.960> bike<00:00:10.200> most<00:00:11.099> Road<00:00:11.280> bikes

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460 
so this is a road bike most Road bikes

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.640 
so this is a road bike most Road bikes
have<00:00:11.670> caliper<00:00:12.179> brakes<00:00:12.420> which<00:00:13.320> is<00:00:13.469> going<00:00:13.590> to

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
have caliper brakes which is going to

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.160 
have caliper brakes which is going to
have<00:00:13.830> a<00:00:14.009> quick-release<00:00:14.809> usually<00:00:15.809> like<00:00:15.960> this

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
have a quick-release usually like this

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.080 
have a quick-release usually like this
which<00:00:17.130> basically<00:00:17.369> is<00:00:17.520> going<00:00:17.640> to<00:00:17.699> open<00:00:17.789> up<00:00:17.970> your

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
which basically is going to open up your

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:19.790 
which basically is going to open up your
brake<00:00:18.300> calipers<00:00:18.720> to<00:00:18.990> allow<00:00:19.260> you<00:00:19.320> to<00:00:19.470> get<00:00:19.650> the

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
brake calipers to allow you to get the

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.000 
brake calipers to allow you to get the
tire<00:00:20.039> out<00:00:20.609> of<00:00:20.670> the<00:00:21.630> actual<00:00:22.050> brake<00:00:22.199> calipers<00:00:22.590> so

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
tire out of the actual brake calipers so

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:28.640 
tire out of the actual brake calipers so
you<00:00:23.240> twist<00:00:24.240> that<00:00:24.359> to<00:00:24.570> the<00:00:24.779> top<00:00:25.109> and<00:00:25.460> then<00:00:27.650> this

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
you twist that to the top and then this

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.439 
you twist that to the top and then this
is<00:00:28.830> a<00:00:28.859> quick-release<00:00:29.099> lever<00:00:29.400> so<00:00:30.090> basically

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
is a quick-release lever so basically

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.299 
is a quick-release lever so basically
you<00:00:30.630> all<00:00:31.019> you're<00:00:31.230> going<00:00:31.320> to<00:00:31.380> do<00:00:31.500> is<00:00:31.619> just<00:00:31.800> get

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
you all you're going to do is just get

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.130 
you all you're going to do is just get
your<00:00:32.399> fingers<00:00:32.700> behind<00:00:32.820> it<00:00:33.090> pull<00:00:33.600> it<00:00:33.719> down<00:00:33.870> and

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
your fingers behind it pull it down and

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.240 
your fingers behind it pull it down and
then<00:00:34.950> unscrew<00:00:35.700> it<00:00:35.940> slightly<00:00:36.210> and<00:00:37.129> your<00:00:38.129> wheel

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
then unscrew it slightly and your wheel

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.260 
then unscrew it slightly and your wheel
just<00:00:38.370> falls<00:00:38.579> right<00:00:38.730> out<00:00:40.430> so<00:00:41.430> then<00:00:41.579> to<00:00:41.910> remount

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
just falls right out so then to remount

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.330 
just falls right out so then to remount
the<00:00:42.480> front<00:00:42.690> wheel<00:00:43.129> basically<00:00:44.129> what<00:00:44.250> you're

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
the front wheel basically what you're

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:45.229 
the front wheel basically what you're
going<00:00:44.460> to<00:00:44.489> do<00:00:44.579> is<00:00:44.670> going<00:00:44.760> to<00:00:44.820> have<00:00:44.910> the<00:00:45.030> lever

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
going to do is going to have the lever

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:46.549 
going to do is going to have the lever
all<00:00:45.390> the<00:00:45.420> way<00:00:45.510> up<00:00:45.660> so<00:00:45.870> you're<00:00:46.230> not<00:00:46.289> gonna<00:00:46.410> hit

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
all the way up so you're not gonna hit

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:49.360 
all the way up so you're not gonna hit
your<00:00:46.649> brake<00:00:46.770> pads<00:00:47.450> have<00:00:48.450> your<00:00:48.690> quick-release

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:49.370 
your brake pads have your quick-release

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:52.220 
your brake pads have your quick-release
open<00:00:50.370> enough<00:00:50.760> so<00:00:51.000> we<00:00:51.660> can<00:00:51.780> get<00:00:51.870> over<00:00:52.050> the

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
open enough so we can get over the

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.639 
open enough so we can get over the
little<00:00:52.469> tabs<00:00:52.710> that<00:00:52.890> are<00:00:53.010> on<00:00:53.070> the<00:00:53.160> bottom<00:00:53.250> here

00:00:54.639 --> 00:00:54.649 
little tabs that are on the bottom here

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:59.180 
little tabs that are on the bottom here
pull<00:00:55.649> it<00:00:55.680> straight<00:00:56.340> up<00:00:56.579> and<00:00:57.239> through<00:00:57.809> and<00:00:58.190> then

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
pull it straight up and through and then

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.369 
pull it straight up and through and then
you're<00:00:59.309> going<00:00:59.460> to<00:00:59.550> screw<00:01:00.120> down<00:01:00.379> the

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
you're going to screw down the

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:06.140 
you're going to screw down the
quick-release<00:01:04.010> not<00:01:05.010> too<00:01:05.220> tight<00:01:05.460> because<00:01:05.760> it's

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
quick-release not too tight because it's

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:07.850 
quick-release not too tight because it's
a<00:01:06.210> lever<00:01:06.450> system<00:01:06.840> so<00:01:07.140> basically<00:01:07.560> it's<00:01:07.740> going

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
a lever system so basically it's going

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.630 
a lever system so basically it's going
to<00:01:08.150> push<00:01:09.150> down<00:01:09.360> and<00:01:09.650> cinch<00:01:10.650> on<00:01:10.799> it<00:01:10.920> by<00:01:11.369> itself

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
to push down and cinch on it by itself

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.539 
to push down and cinch on it by itself
so<00:01:12.570> just<00:01:13.470> kind<00:01:13.590> of<00:01:13.650> get<00:01:13.740> that<00:01:13.830> feel<00:01:14.100> this<00:01:14.430> is<00:01:14.520> a

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
so just kind of get that feel this is a

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:15.770 
so just kind of get that feel this is a
little<00:01:14.729> bit<00:01:14.820> too<00:01:14.939> tight<00:01:15.119> see<00:01:15.360> I<00:01:15.420> can't<00:01:15.600> push<00:01:15.750> it

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
little bit too tight see I can't push it

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.649 
little bit too tight see I can't push it
easily<00:01:17.000> so<00:01:18.000> I'm<00:01:18.150> going<00:01:18.270> to<00:01:18.299> unscrew<00:01:18.630> it

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
easily so I'm going to unscrew it

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:22.130 
easily so I'm going to unscrew it
slightly<00:01:18.960> and<00:01:20.030> then<00:01:21.030> that's<00:01:21.689> just<00:01:21.930> way<00:01:22.080> too

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
slightly and then that's just way too

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.380 
slightly and then that's just way too
easy<00:01:22.409> that's<00:01:22.740> really<00:01:23.009> dangerous<00:01:23.220> because<00:01:24.180> it

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
easy that's really dangerous because it

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.620 
easy that's really dangerous because it
could<00:01:24.479> flop<00:01:24.689> open<00:01:24.840> at<00:01:24.990> a<00:01:25.110> time<00:01:26.060> so<00:01:27.060> just<00:01:27.299> right

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
could flop open at a time so just right

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.780 
could flop open at a time so just right
in<00:01:27.750> the<00:01:27.810> middle<00:01:27.990> of<00:01:28.080> those<00:01:28.229> two<00:01:28.579> it's<00:01:29.579> better

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
in the middle of those two it's better

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.190 
in the middle of those two it's better
to<00:01:29.909> have<00:01:30.000> it<00:01:30.119> a<00:01:30.180> little<00:01:30.270> bit<00:01:30.450> tight<00:01:30.659> just<00:01:30.960> to<00:01:31.110> be

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
to have it a little bit tight just to be

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.050 
to have it a little bit tight just to be
safe<00:01:31.439> also<00:01:32.280> you<00:01:32.520> want<00:01:32.640> to<00:01:32.700> make<00:01:32.790> sure<00:01:32.820> that

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
safe also you want to make sure that

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.420 
safe also you want to make sure that
when<00:01:33.210> you<00:01:33.360> pull<00:01:33.570> it<00:01:33.659> up<00:01:33.750> straight<00:01:34.049> it's

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:34.430 
when you pull it up straight it's

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:37.340 
when you pull it up straight it's
sitting<00:01:35.430> straight<00:01:35.700> in<00:01:35.939> the<00:01:36.360> fork<00:01:36.659> so

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
sitting straight in the fork so

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.219 
sitting straight in the fork so
basically<00:01:37.770> you<00:01:38.640> can<00:01:38.759> see<00:01:38.939> the<00:01:39.090> line<00:01:39.299> from

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
basically you can see the line from

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.530 
basically you can see the line from
where<00:01:40.409> the<00:01:40.470> bolt<00:01:40.650> is<00:01:40.829> on<00:01:41.130> the<00:01:41.400> brakes<00:01:41.820> and<00:01:42.060> make

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
where the bolt is on the brakes and make

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:43.880 
where the bolt is on the brakes and make
sure<00:01:42.630> this<00:01:42.810> is<00:01:42.930> really<00:01:43.049> straight<00:01:43.380> you<00:01:43.770> don't

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
sure this is really straight you don't

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.069 
sure this is really straight you don't
want<00:01:44.009> to<00:01:44.130> have<00:01:44.430> it<00:01:44.549> sideways<00:01:44.850> like<00:01:45.180> that<00:01:45.390> or<00:01:45.899> on

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
want to have it sideways like that or on

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:47.300 
want to have it sideways like that or on
the<00:01:46.170> other<00:01:46.229> side<00:01:46.439> sideways<00:01:46.860> because<00:01:47.130> then

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
the other side sideways because then

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:48.859 
the other side sideways because then
it's<00:01:47.909> not<00:01:48.000> going<00:01:48.149> to<00:01:48.210> sit<00:01:48.299> properly<00:01:48.420> and<00:01:48.780> also

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
it's not going to sit properly and also

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.109 
it's not going to sit properly and also
it's<00:01:49.079> not<00:01:49.140> gonna<00:01:49.290> ride<00:01:49.439> properly<00:01:50.000> so<00:01:51.000> make

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
it's not gonna ride properly so make

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:52.700 
it's not gonna ride properly so make
sure<00:01:51.149> you<00:01:51.299> since<00:01:51.479> that<00:01:51.600> closed<00:01:51.869> you<00:01:52.530> don't

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
sure you since that closed you don't
