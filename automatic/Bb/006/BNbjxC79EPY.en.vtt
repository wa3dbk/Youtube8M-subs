00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
mentioned in the very next sentence so I

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:23.960 
mentioned in the very next sentence so I
mean<00:02:22.230> I<00:02:22.260> can<00:02:22.530> understand<00:02:23.130> why<00:02:23.340> people<00:02:23.370> will<00:02:23.850> be

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970

skeptical<00:02:24.600> and<00:02:24.630> not<00:02:24.870> believing<00:02:25.290> in<00:02:25.410> that

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
skeptical and not believing in that

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.370 
skeptical and not believing in that
because<00:02:25.920> I'm<00:02:26.550> on<00:02:26.790> and<00:02:27.240> here<00:02:27.870> we<00:02:27.990> have<00:02:28.170> two

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:28.380 
because I'm on and here we have two

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:30.110 
because I'm on and here we have two
different<00:02:28.590> last<00:02:28.890> names<00:02:29.190> although<00:02:29.550> they<00:02:29.940> are

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
different last names although they are

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.600 
different last names although they are
similar<00:02:30.630> and<00:02:31.050> Yuri<00:02:31.709> did<00:02:32.040> mention<00:02:32.250> that<00:02:32.400> his

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
similar and Yuri did mention that his

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:35.840 
similar and Yuri did mention that his
father<00:02:32.880> died<00:02:33.530> by<00:02:34.530> the<00:02:34.590> owl<00:02:35.010> but<00:02:35.370> even<00:02:35.670> with

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:35.850 
father died by the owl but even with

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:37.760 
father died by the owl but even with
that<00:02:35.880> being<00:02:36.240> said<00:02:36.330> I'm<00:02:36.660> pretty<00:02:36.810> sure<00:02:37.080> the<00:02:37.260> CCG

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:37.770 
that being said I'm pretty sure the CCG

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:39.410 
that being said I'm pretty sure the CCG
couldn't<00:02:38.100> have<00:02:38.190> bent<00:02:38.610> the<00:02:38.700> truth<00:02:39.030> just

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
couldn't have bent the truth just

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.479 
couldn't have bent the truth just
slightly<00:02:39.900> because<00:02:40.080> the<00:02:40.530> last<00:02:40.739> big<00:02:41.040> fight<00:02:41.310> we

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:41.489 
slightly because the last big fight we

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:44.240 
slightly because the last big fight we
saw<00:02:41.700> Amon<00:02:42.030> in<00:02:42.450> he<00:02:42.989> was<00:02:43.260> fighting<00:02:43.650> Kenichi<00:02:44.040> and

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
saw Amon in he was fighting Kenichi and

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:45.650 
saw Amon in he was fighting Kenichi and
I'm<00:02:44.310> pretty<00:02:44.580> sure<00:02:44.700> they<00:02:45.060> would<00:02:45.270> not<00:02:45.420> mention

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
I'm pretty sure they would not mention

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:48.199 
I'm pretty sure they would not mention
Kenickie<00:02:46.380> because<00:02:46.920> of<00:02:47.220> reasons<00:02:47.820> that<00:02:47.910> may

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:48.209 
Kenickie because of reasons that may

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:50.960 
Kenickie because of reasons that may
make<00:02:48.450> Satsuki<00:02:49.320> go<00:02:49.530> insane<00:02:50.160> so<00:02:50.550> they<00:02:50.700> could've

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
make Satsuki go insane so they could've

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:53.150 
make Satsuki go insane so they could've
just<00:02:51.120> told<00:02:51.330> URI<00:02:51.660> that<00:02:51.930> he<00:02:52.260> died<00:02:52.500> in<00:02:52.890> the<00:02:52.920> owl

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
just told URI that he died in the owl

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:54.680 
just told URI that he died in the owl
fight<00:02:53.580> and<00:02:53.820> they<00:02:53.970> could<00:02:54.150> have<00:02:54.239> changed<00:02:54.600> his

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
fight and they could have changed his

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:57.229 
fight and they could have changed his
last<00:02:54.840> name<00:02:55.019> for<00:02:55.470> many<00:02:55.709> reasons<00:02:56.190> I<00:02:56.340> mean<00:02:56.730> he<00:02:57.000> is

00:02:57.229 --> 00:02:57.239 
last name for many reasons I mean he is

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:00.560 
last name for many reasons I mean he is
a<00:02:57.540> project<00:02:58.230> because<00:02:58.470> the<00:02:58.800> cwienke<00:02:59.450> project<00:03:00.450> is

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:00.570 
a project because the cwienke project is

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:03.650 
a project because the cwienke project is
relatively<00:03:01.140> new<00:03:01.650> so<00:03:02.370> I<00:03:02.700> can<00:03:02.970> understand<00:03:03.480> why

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:03.660 
relatively new so I can understand why

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:04.970 
relatively new so I can understand why
they<00:03:03.870> would<00:03:04.019> want<00:03:04.050> to<00:03:04.290> change<00:03:04.410> his<00:03:04.590> name<00:03:04.620> we

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
they would want to change his name we

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:06.800 
they would want to change his name we
kind<00:03:05.220> of<00:03:05.310> bent<00:03:05.489> the<00:03:05.580> truth<00:03:05.790> about<00:03:05.940> a<00:03:06.269> mom<00:03:06.480> being

is obviously this same character and we

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:28.340 
is obviously this same character and we
just<00:03:26.489> saw<00:03:26.700> like<00:03:27.299> the<00:03:27.480> bottom<00:03:27.840> half<00:03:28.079> of<00:03:28.230> his

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:28.350 
just saw like the bottom half of his

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:30.560 
just saw like the bottom half of his
face<00:03:28.590> in<00:03:28.829> his<00:03:28.860> hair<00:03:29.190> he<00:03:29.430> looks<00:03:29.640> exactly<00:03:30.120> like<00:03:30.390> a

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:30.570 
face in his hair he looks exactly like a

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:33.440 
face in his hair he looks exactly like a
mind<00:03:30.900> so<00:03:31.140> this<00:03:31.320> means<00:03:31.590> Amon<00:03:32.489> is<00:03:32.519> half<00:03:33.000> goals

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:33.450 
mind so this means Amon is half goals

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:36.860 
mind so this means Amon is half goals
and<00:03:33.900> that<00:03:34.799> would<00:03:35.070> make<00:03:35.340> the<00:03:35.700> Kenichi<00:03:36.420> and<00:03:36.660> a

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870 
and that would make the Kenichi and a

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:38.840 
and that would make the Kenichi and a
mine<00:03:37.110> talk<00:03:37.560> that<00:03:37.920> we've<00:03:38.040> all<00:03:38.310> been<00:03:38.549> waiting

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:38.850 
mine talk that we've all been waiting

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:40.789 
mine talk that we've all been waiting
for<00:03:38.880> all<00:03:39.329> the<00:03:39.540> more<00:03:39.720> meaningful<00:03:39.750> now<00:03:40.500> that

00:03:40.789 --> 00:03:40.799 
for all the more meaningful now that

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:43.970 
for all the more meaningful now that
Amon<00:03:41.700> can<00:03:42.120> understand<00:03:42.810> where<00:03:43.260> Kenichi<00:03:43.739> was

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:43.980 
Amon can understand where Kenichi was

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:45.590 
Amon can understand where Kenichi was
coming<00:03:44.370> from<00:03:44.549> back<00:03:44.850> then<00:03:45.090> when<00:03:45.269> he<00:03:45.390> didn't

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:45.600 
coming from back then when he didn't

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:47.120 
coming from back then when he didn't
want<00:03:45.660> to<00:03:45.780> eat<00:03:45.959> humans<00:03:46.350> because<00:03:46.709> Amon<00:03:47.100> is

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:47.130 
want to eat humans because Amon is

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:49.250 
want to eat humans because Amon is
eating<00:03:48.000> a<00:03:48.120> goodie<00:03:48.540> member<00:03:48.930> so<00:03:49.110> he's

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:49.260 
eating a goodie member so he's

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.620 
eating a goodie member so he's
committing<00:03:49.880> cannibalism<00:03:50.880> not<00:03:51.030> necessarily

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:51.630 
committing cannibalism not necessarily

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:54.560 
committing cannibalism not necessarily
eating<00:03:51.840> humans<00:03:52.500> and<00:03:52.739> I'm<00:03:53.579> guessing<00:03:54.180> he<00:03:54.450> was

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:54.570 
eating humans and I'm guessing he was

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:56.660 
eating humans and I'm guessing he was
experimented<00:03:55.380> on<00:03:55.500> by<00:03:55.769> Cano<00:03:56.100> and<00:03:56.310> escaped

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:56.670 
experimented on by Cano and escaped

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:58.759 
experimented on by Cano and escaped
that's<00:03:57.030> why<00:03:57.209> he<00:03:57.390> has<00:03:57.510> his<00:03:57.720> hatred<00:03:57.959> towards<00:03:58.620> a

00:03:58.759 --> 00:03:58.769 
that's why he has his hatred towards a

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:00.350 
that's why he has his hatred towards a
guinea<00:03:59.040> that's<00:03:59.459> what<00:03:59.610> I'm<00:03:59.670> guessing<00:03:59.940> I<00:04:00.239> have

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:00.360 
guinea that's what I'm guessing I have

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:02.750 
guinea that's what I'm guessing I have
no<00:04:00.540> idea<00:04:00.930> and<00:04:01.260> if<00:04:01.650> that<00:04:01.769> is<00:04:01.980> the<00:04:02.010> case<00:04:02.370> this

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:02.760 
no idea and if that is the case this

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:05.330 
no idea and if that is the case this
means<00:04:03.060> Amon<00:04:03.480> has<00:04:03.690> Kaku<00:04:04.290> Jay<00:04:04.500> I<00:04:04.530> cannot<00:04:04.920> wait<00:04:05.190> to

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:05.340 
means Amon has Kaku Jay I cannot wait to

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:07.819 
means Amon has Kaku Jay I cannot wait to
see<00:04:05.549> Kenickie<00:04:06.450> and<00:04:06.690> a<00:04:06.840> mon<00:04:07.049> go<00:04:07.350> in<00:04:07.590> together

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:07.829 
see Kenickie and a mon go in together

00:04:07.829 --> 00:04:09.830 
see Kenickie and a mon go in together
because<00:04:08.280> I'm<00:04:08.609> sure<00:04:08.970> it's<00:04:09.150> going<00:04:09.359> to<00:04:09.540> happen

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:09.840 
because I'm sure it's going to happen

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:11.569 
because I'm sure it's going to happen
and<00:04:10.140> I<00:04:10.230> think<00:04:10.260> we're<00:04:10.650> going<00:04:10.829> to<00:04:10.980> get<00:04:11.130> a<00:04:11.190> big

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:11.579 
and I think we're going to get a big

00:04:11.579 --> 00:04:15.080 
and I think we're going to get a big
reveal<00:04:12.090> and<00:04:12.420> chapter<00:04:13.230> 36<00:04:14.190> simply<00:04:14.730> because

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:15.090 
reveal and chapter 36 simply because

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:19.410 
reveal and chapter 36 simply because
chapter<00:04:15.780> 63<00:04:16.289> was<00:04:17.039> the<00:04:17.370> chapter<00:04:18.060> that<00:04:18.390> Kenickie

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:19.420 
chapter 63 was the chapter that Kenickie

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:23.430 
chapter 63 was the chapter that Kenickie

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:23.440 
Gulen accepted Ruiz a and ate heroin did

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:25.470 
Gulen accepted Ruiz a and ate heroin did
the<00:04:23.590> badass<00:04:23.980> shit<00:04:24.250> he<00:04:24.460> did<00:04:24.610> to<00:04:24.820> your<00:04:25.030> Maury<00:04:25.270> and

the badass shit he did to your Maury and
stuff<00:04:25.720> like<00:04:25.900> that<00:04:26.080> although<00:04:26.380> I<00:04:26.410> could<00:04:26.680> be

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:26.710 
stuff like that although I could be

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:28.860 
stuff like that although I could be
looking<00:04:27.130> too<00:04:27.550> much<00:04:27.730> into<00:04:28.090> that<00:04:28.240> but<00:04:28.600> you<00:04:28.780> will

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:28.870 
looking too much into that but you will

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:31.740 
looking too much into that but you will
be<00:04:29.020> surprised<00:04:29.500> at<00:04:29.890> how<00:04:30.040> many<00:04:30.700> times<00:04:31.060> like

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:31.750 
be surprised at how many times like

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:34.140 
be surprised at how many times like
manga<00:04:32.200> authors<00:04:32.620> have<00:04:32.800> done<00:04:33.070> that<00:04:33.310> like<00:04:33.610> taking

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:34.150 
manga authors have done that like taking

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:36.420 
manga authors have done that like taking
their<00:04:34.390> original<00:04:35.230> work<00:04:35.440> and<00:04:35.710> reversing<00:04:36.400> the

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:36.430 
their original work and reversing the

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:38.250 
their original work and reversing the
numbers<00:04:36.820> and<00:04:37.060> making<00:04:37.270> an<00:04:37.600> epic<00:04:37.930> thing<00:04:38.110> to

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:38.260 
numbers and making an epic thing to

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:40.740 
numbers and making an epic thing to
happen<00:04:38.410> like<00:04:38.620> that<00:04:38.830> like<00:04:38.980> and<00:04:39.310> one<00:04:39.910> piece<00:04:40.210> that

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:40.750 
happen like that like and one piece that

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:42.900 
happen like that like and one piece that
happened<00:04:41.170> very<00:04:41.230> recently<00:04:41.650> with<00:04:42.160> a<00:04:42.190> gear<00:04:42.610> 4th

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:42.910 
happened very recently with a gear 4th

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:44.580 
happened very recently with a gear 4th
and<00:04:43.060> whatnot<00:04:43.330> so<00:04:43.750> I<00:04:43.780> wouldn't<00:04:44.110> be<00:04:44.200> surprised

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:44.590 
and whatnot so I wouldn't be surprised

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:46.410 
and whatnot so I wouldn't be surprised
but<00:04:44.830> overall<00:04:45.040> this<00:04:45.340> chapter<00:04:45.670> was<00:04:45.850> pretty<00:04:46.150> cool

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:46.420 
but overall this chapter was pretty cool

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:49.620 
but overall this chapter was pretty cool
I<00:04:46.870> like<00:04:47.200> how<00:04:47.620> when<00:04:47.830> Kenickie<00:04:48.310> saw<00:04:48.880> this<00:04:49.180> young

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:49.630 
I like how when Kenickie saw this young

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:52.650 
I like how when Kenickie saw this young
white-haired<00:04:50.410> Kenichi<00:04:50.950> I<00:04:50.980> guess<00:04:51.400> he<00:04:52.360> was<00:04:52.480> like

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:52.660 
white-haired Kenichi I guess he was like

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:54.720 
white-haired Kenichi I guess he was like
I<00:04:52.870> don't<00:04:53.020> want<00:04:53.440> to<00:04:53.560> disappear<00:04:54.010> please<00:04:54.220> don't

make me disappear protect me and then

00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:58.560 
make me disappear protect me and then
that's<00:04:57.100> when<00:04:57.340> community<00:04:57.700> really<00:04:58.060> got<00:04:58.270> up<00:04:58.420> and

00:04:58.560 --> 00:04:58.570 
that's when community really got up and

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:00.210 
that's when community really got up and
started<00:04:58.660> whooping<00:04:59.050> ass<00:04:59.200> but<00:04:59.590> that's<00:05:00.040> really

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:00.220 
started whooping ass but that's really

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:02.400 
started whooping ass but that's really
the<00:05:00.400> only<00:05:00.460> epic<00:05:00.970> thing<00:05:01.150> we<00:05:01.330> saw<00:05:01.540> him<00:05:01.780> do<00:05:02.050> I<00:05:02.080> was

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:02.410 
the only epic thing we saw him do I was

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:03.930 
the only epic thing we saw him do I was
expecting<00:05:02.920> a<00:05:03.010> little<00:05:03.100> bit<00:05:03.340> more<00:05:03.490> like<00:05:03.610> I<00:05:03.700> said

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:03.940 
expecting a little bit more like I said

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:06.030 
expecting a little bit more like I said
and<00:05:04.390> what's<00:05:04.600> going<00:05:04.780> on<00:05:05.110> with<00:05:05.410> that<00:05:05.440> young

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:06.040 
and what's going on with that young

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:09.390 
and what's going on with that young
konnichi<00:05:06.700> because<00:05:07.060> I<00:05:07.980> thought<00:05:08.980> that<00:05:09.220> it<00:05:09.340> was

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:09.400 
konnichi because I thought that it was
