00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.060 

in<00:00:00.269> this<00:00:00.900> lesson<00:00:01.140> we're<00:00:01.439> going<00:00:01.469> to<00:00:01.620> go<00:00:02.040> ahead

00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:02.070 
in this lesson we're going to go ahead

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:03.919 
in this lesson we're going to go ahead
and<00:00:02.250> do<00:00:02.429> a<00:00:02.460> little<00:00:02.669> bit<00:00:02.879> of<00:00:02.909> cleanup<00:00:03.179> before<00:00:03.540> we

00:00:03.919 --> 00:00:03.929 
and do a little bit of cleanup before we

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:06.820 
and do a little bit of cleanup before we
we<00:00:04.650> actually<00:00:05.009> go<00:00:05.130> ahead<00:00:05.310> and<00:00:05.430> make<00:00:05.609> our<00:00:05.640> doors

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:06.830 
we actually go ahead and make our doors

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:10.250 
we actually go ahead and make our doors
and<00:00:08.420> you<00:00:09.420> can<00:00:09.570> see<00:00:09.719> that<00:00:09.750> i'm<00:00:09.929> just<00:00:09.960> going<00:00:10.200> to

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260 
and you can see that i'm just going to

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.410 
and you can see that i'm just going to
simply<00:00:10.440> delete<00:00:11.280> one<00:00:11.550> half<00:00:11.790> a<00:00:11.910> little<00:00:12.150> model

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
simply delete one half a little model

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:14.990 
simply delete one half a little model
again<00:00:12.889> for<00:00:13.889> what<00:00:14.040> seems<00:00:14.280> like<00:00:14.400> the<00:00:14.730> the

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
again for what seems like the the

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.400 
again for what seems like the the
10,000th<00:00:15.719> time<00:00:15.900> but<00:00:16.350> that's<00:00:16.500> okay<00:00:18.230> it's<00:00:19.230> just

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
10,000th time but that's okay it's just

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.250 
10,000th time but that's okay it's just
a<00:00:19.500> process<00:00:19.680> that<00:00:19.949> i<00:00:20.160> use<00:00:20.460> and<00:00:20.750> it<00:00:21.750> doesn't<00:00:22.109> take

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
a process that i use and it doesn't take

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.689 
a process that i use and it doesn't take
too<00:00:22.439> long<00:00:23.630> we<00:00:24.630> just<00:00:24.920> and<00:00:25.920> that's<00:00:26.160> just<00:00:26.340> so<00:00:26.550> that

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
too long we just and that's just so that

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:27.920 
too long we just and that's just so that
i<00:00:26.730> only<00:00:26.849> have<00:00:27.060> to<00:00:27.150> do<00:00:27.269> it<00:00:27.390> on<00:00:27.449> one<00:00:27.630> side<00:00:27.689> i

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
i only have to do it on one side i

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:29.240 
i only have to do it on one side i
actually<00:00:28.289> won't<00:00:28.439> have<00:00:28.619> to<00:00:28.740> do<00:00:28.830> it<00:00:28.949> on<00:00:29.010> both

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
actually won't have to do it on both

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:30.830 
actually won't have to do it on both
sides<00:00:29.550> which<00:00:29.849> you<00:00:30.150> know<00:00:30.240> is<00:00:30.359> going<00:00:30.570> to<00:00:30.630> save<00:00:30.810> us

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
sides which you know is going to save us

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:39.360 
sides which you know is going to save us
a<00:00:31.019> lot<00:00:31.050> of<00:00:31.230> time

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:39.370 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:41.700 

I'm<00:00:39.969> just<00:00:40.149> editing<00:00:40.629> the<00:00:40.840> geometry<00:00:41.379> here<00:00:41.530> so

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:41.710 
I'm just editing the geometry here so

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:44.450 
I'm just editing the geometry here so
that<00:00:41.800> I<00:00:41.890> get<00:00:42.070> a<00:00:42.100> better<00:00:42.640> layout<00:00:42.879> of<00:00:43.180> quads<00:00:43.540> and

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
that I get a better layout of quads and

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:52.460 
that I get a better layout of quads and
not<00:00:45.460> that<00:00:45.699> sort<00:00:46.360> of<00:00:46.480> like<00:00:46.750> super<00:00:47.410> sharp<00:00:47.680> edge

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:52.470 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:55.190 

let's<00:00:53.100> just<00:00:53.280> draw<00:00:53.460> across

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:55.200 
let's just draw across

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.870 
let's just draw across
and<00:00:55.800> go<00:00:56.670> ahead<00:00:56.700> and<00:00:56.970> delete<00:00:57.090> those<00:00:57.420> edges<00:00:58.880> do

00:00:59.870 --> 00:00:59.880 
and go ahead and delete those edges do

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:03.500 
and go ahead and delete those edges do
the<00:01:00.030> same<00:01:00.240> thing<00:01:00.510> here<00:01:00.690> on<00:01:00.810> the<00:01:00.930> top<00:01:02.420> just<00:01:03.420> a

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
the same thing here on the top just a

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.240 
the same thing here on the top just a
little<00:01:03.630> bit<00:01:03.810> of<00:01:03.930> simple<00:01:04.760> geometric<00:01:05.760> editing

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:07.250 
little bit of simple geometric editing

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:09.980 
little bit of simple geometric editing
and<00:01:08.250> you<00:01:08.430> just<00:01:08.820> really<00:01:09.090> want<00:01:09.120> flow<00:01:09.570> in<00:01:09.750> terms

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
and you just really want flow in terms

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.020 
and you just really want flow in terms
of<00:01:10.200> you<00:01:10.530> know<00:01:10.560> your<00:01:10.860> geometry<00:01:11.160> you<00:01:11.580> don't<00:01:11.820> want

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
of you know your geometry you don't want

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.680 
of you know your geometry you don't want
it<00:01:12.090> to<00:01:12.210> be<00:01:12.420> I<00:01:14.030> don't<00:01:15.030> want<00:01:15.150> to<00:01:15.210> say<00:01:15.330> goofy

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:15.690 
it to be I don't want to say goofy

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:17.810 
it to be I don't want to say goofy
looking<00:01:15.990> but<00:01:16.229> you<00:01:16.380> just<00:01:16.950> you<00:01:17.340> want<00:01:17.550> it<00:01:17.610> to<00:01:17.700> flow

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
looking but you just you want it to flow

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.640 
looking but you just you want it to flow
better<00:01:18.090> than<00:01:18.360> it<00:01:18.510> da<00:01:20.450> the<00:01:21.450> most<00:01:21.780> polygon

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
better than it da the most polygon

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.020 
better than it da the most polygon
geometry<00:01:22.680> you<00:01:23.220> want<00:01:23.370> it<00:01:23.460> to<00:01:23.550> flow<00:01:23.670> correctly

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
geometry you want it to flow correctly

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.330 
geometry you want it to flow correctly
you<00:01:24.390> don't<00:01:24.600> want<00:01:24.780> it<00:01:24.840> to<00:01:24.960> have<00:01:25.140> to<00:01:25.770> be<00:01:25.920> sort<00:01:26.250> of

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
you don't want it to have to be sort of

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.609 
you don't want it to have to be sort of
like<00:01:26.460> weirded<00:01:27.000> out<00:01:27.150> and<00:01:27.479> sometimes<00:01:28.080> if<00:01:28.500> you

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
like weirded out and sometimes if you

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.020 
like weirded out and sometimes if you
haven't<00:01:28.979> weirded<00:01:29.280> out<00:01:29.369> it's<00:01:29.550> going<00:01:29.759> to<00:01:29.820> end<00:01:29.910> up

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
haven't weirded out it's going to end up

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:35.450 
haven't weirded out it's going to end up
causing<00:01:31.729> rendering<00:01:32.729> issues<00:01:33.950> and<00:01:34.950> that's<00:01:35.220> the

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
causing rendering issues and that's the

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:36.950 
causing rendering issues and that's the
main<00:01:35.610> key<00:01:35.850> here<00:01:36.090> is<00:01:36.119> you<00:01:36.300> really<00:01:36.450> want<00:01:36.570> you

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
main key here is you really want you

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.490 
main key here is you really want you
know<00:01:37.020> flow<00:01:37.410> in<00:01:37.590> your<00:01:37.650> geometry<00:01:39.020> now<00:01:40.020> go<00:01:40.380> ahead

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
know flow in your geometry now go ahead

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:46.330 
know flow in your geometry now go ahead
and<00:01:41.509> move<00:01:42.509> these<00:01:42.720> votes<00:01:43.020> here<00:01:43.290> a<00:01:43.320> little<00:01:43.830> bit

know really well this is just a little
bit<00:02:20.940> of<00:02:21.060> simple<00:02:21.360> editing<00:02:22.670> that's<00:02:23.670> looking

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
bit of simple editing that's looking

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.840 
bit of simple editing that's looking
good

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:29.850 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:33.140 

lets<00:02:30.360> you<00:02:30.600> know<00:02:30.630> pretty<00:02:31.320> clean<00:02:31.620> I<00:02:32.150> don't

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
lets you know pretty clean I don't

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:39.050 
lets you know pretty clean I don't
really<00:02:33.240> see<00:02:33.510> any<00:02:33.860> any<00:02:34.860> major<00:02:35.040> issues<00:02:35.550> there

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:44.440 

omer<00:02:40.060> back<00:02:40.269> the<00:02:40.480> geometry<00:02:41.159> merge<00:02:42.159> it<00:02:42.430> and

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:44.450 
omer back the geometry merge it and

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:47.300 
omer back the geometry merge it and
basically<00:02:45.450> there<00:02:45.659> you<00:02:45.810> go<00:02:45.989> there's<00:02:46.379> a<00:02:46.530> little

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
basically there you go there's a little

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:54.130 
basically there you go there's a little
bit<00:02:47.519> of<00:02:47.549> editing<00:02:47.700> for<00:02:48.230> pre<00:02:49.230> door<00:02:49.549> construction

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:54.140 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:55.840 

I'm<00:02:54.530> still<00:02:54.890> need<00:02:55.100> to<00:02:55.190> go<00:02:55.310> ahead<00:02:55.430> and<00:02:55.640> select

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:55.850 
I'm still need to go ahead and select

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:59.740 
I'm still need to go ahead and select
all<00:02:56.180> these<00:02:56.390> farts<00:02:56.890> properly<00:02:57.890> and<00:02:58.450> then<00:02:59.450> we<00:02:59.569> can

00:02:59.740 --> 00:02:59.750 
all these farts properly and then we can

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:04.110 
all these farts properly and then we can
go<00:02:59.780> ahead<00:02:59.990> and<00:03:00.110> merge<00:03:00.440> them

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:04.120 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:06.180 

and<00:03:04.239> there<00:03:04.690> we<00:03:04.810> go

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:06.190 
and there we go

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:10.710 
and there we go
then<00:03:06.760> we<00:03:06.850> can<00:03:06.970> go<00:03:07.120> ahead<00:03:07.240> and<00:03:07.360> make<00:03:08.290> our<00:03:08.440> door
