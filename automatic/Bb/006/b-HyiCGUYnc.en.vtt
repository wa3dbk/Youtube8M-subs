00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
so this time I'm not gonna be breaking

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.860 
so this time I'm not gonna be breaking
on<00:00:37.710> every<00:00:38.520> single<00:00:38.879> ability<00:00:39.540> in<00:00:39.719> the<00:00:39.840> game

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
on every single ability in the game

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.889 
on every single ability in the game
because<00:00:40.320> most<00:00:41.309> of<00:00:41.489> these<00:00:41.700> don't<00:00:42.600> actually

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
because most of these don't actually

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:44.959 
because most of these don't actually
work<00:00:43.320> I've<00:00:43.559> tried<00:00:43.860> them<00:00:44.100> I<00:00:44.280> tested<00:00:44.670> them<00:00:44.760> like

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
work I've tried them I tested them like

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.150 
work I've tried them I tested them like
I<00:00:45.270> don't<00:00:45.750> actually<00:00:45.960> have<00:00:46.170> an<00:00:46.440> effect<00:00:46.559> to<00:00:47.010> them

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
I don't actually have an effect to them

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.639 
I don't actually have an effect to them
like<00:00:47.370> you<00:00:47.489> can't<00:00:47.700> see<00:00:47.879> a<00:00:47.910> visual<00:00:48.300> effect<00:00:48.719> for

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
like you can't see a visual effect for

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.400 
like you can't see a visual effect for
example<00:00:50.399> I<00:00:50.789> don't<00:00:51.059> know<00:00:51.180> the<00:00:51.510> solar<00:00:51.750> wind<00:00:52.020> you

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
example I don't know the solar wind you

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.500 
example I don't know the solar wind you
can't<00:00:52.680> actually<00:00:52.920> see<00:00:53.160> them<00:00:53.579> being<00:00:54.000> hit<00:00:54.300> back

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
can't actually see them being hit back

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.330 
can't actually see them being hit back
all<00:00:54.719> the<00:00:54.809> time<00:00:54.930> whatever<00:00:55.140> sort<00:00:55.559> decided<00:00:56.039> and

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
all the time whatever sort decided and

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:57.950 
all the time whatever sort decided and
you<00:00:56.820> can't<00:00:57.030> see<00:00:57.239> them<00:00:57.329> explode<00:00:57.780> with

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
you can't see them explode with

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.170 
you can't see them explode with
brimstone<00:00:58.260> either<00:00:58.739> so<00:00:59.489> it's<00:00:59.640> kind<00:00:59.940> of<00:01:00.030> just

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
brimstone either so it's kind of just

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.689 
brimstone either so it's kind of just
stupid<00:01:00.890> trying<00:01:01.890> to<00:01:02.010> show<00:01:02.160> you<00:01:02.219> something<00:01:02.579> that

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
stupid trying to show you something that

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.070 
stupid trying to show you something that
you're<00:01:02.789> not<00:01:02.910> gonna<00:01:03.030> be<00:01:03.120> able<00:01:03.270> to<00:01:03.420> see<00:01:03.600> so<00:01:03.840> I

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
you're not gonna be able to see so I

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.020 
you're not gonna be able to see so I
just<00:01:04.619> limited<00:01:04.979> it<00:01:05.070> down<00:01:05.220> to<00:01:05.369> a<00:01:05.400> few<00:01:05.700> things<00:01:05.909> I

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
just limited it down to a few things I

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.520 
just limited it down to a few things I
already<00:01:06.240> got<00:01:06.330> the<00:01:06.450> clips<00:01:06.659> for<00:01:06.780> my<00:01:07.020> stress<00:01:07.290> to

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
already got the clips for my stress to

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.130 
already got the clips for my stress to
the<00:01:07.619> all<00:01:07.770> I<00:01:07.799> and<00:01:08.130> I've<00:01:08.220> got<00:01:08.369> the<00:01:08.490> clips<00:01:08.729> ready

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:09.140 
the all I and I've got the clips ready

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:11.780 
the all I and I've got the clips ready
so<00:01:10.140> anything<00:01:10.560> that<00:01:10.710> does<00:01:10.920> a<00:01:11.130> visual<00:01:11.490> effect

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
and I think that I think is worth

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.100 
and I think that I think is worth
showing<00:01:13.770> I'm<00:01:14.159> going<00:01:14.340> to<00:01:14.400> show<00:01:14.610> you<00:01:14.640> so<00:01:15.450> first

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
which is the basic grenade which is what

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.170 
which is the basic grenade which is what
we're<00:01:19.080> going<00:01:19.110> to<00:01:19.259> be<00:01:19.320> using<00:01:19.560> and<00:01:20.060> you'll<00:01:21.060> see

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180

the<00:01:21.270> game<00:01:21.390> plays<00:01:21.600> out

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:29.420 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:31.510 

next<00:01:30.140> we<00:01:30.260> have<00:01:30.380> the<00:01:30.500> Firebug<00:01:30.950> grenaded<00:01:31.400> a

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:31.520 
next we have the Firebug grenaded a

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:33.100 
next we have the Firebug grenaded a
grenade<00:01:31.880> that<00:01:31.909> unleashes<00:01:32.450> bolts<00:01:32.780> of<00:01:32.900> solar

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:33.110 
grenade that unleashes bolts of solar

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:35.850 
grenade that unleashes bolts of solar
light<00:01:33.380> at<00:01:33.590> nearby<00:01:33.890> enemies<00:01:34.460> just<00:01:34.850> like<00:01:35.000> the

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:35.860 
light at nearby enemies just like the

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:38.109 
light at nearby enemies just like the
think<00:01:36.860> it's<00:01:36.950> the<00:01:37.100> third<00:01:37.280> ability<00:01:37.550> of<00:01:37.820> the<00:01:37.940> void

00:01:38.109 --> 00:01:38.119 
think it's the third ability of the void

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:41.560 
think it's the third ability of the void
Walker<00:01:39.040> and<00:01:40.040> lastly<00:01:40.850> we<00:01:41.030> have<00:01:41.180> the<00:01:41.330> fusion
