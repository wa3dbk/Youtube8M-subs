overcome this obstacle we need to

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.240 
overcome this obstacle we need to
increase<00:01:21.210> the<00:01:21.330> frequency<00:01:21.720> and<00:01:22.350> size<00:01:22.950> of<00:01:23.189> the

increase the frequency and size of the
experiment<00:01:23.909> to<00:01:24.600> this<00:01:24.750> end<00:01:24.990> I<00:01:25.290> suggest<00:01:26.100> we<00:01:26.250> find

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
experiment to this end I suggest we find

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.050 
experiment to this end I suggest we find
not<00:01:26.970> only<00:01:27.000> a<00:01:27.450> regular<00:01:27.960> supply<00:01:28.170> of<00:01:28.440> 115<00:01:29.310> but

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
not only a regular supply of 115 but

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.240 
not only a regular supply of 115 but
that<00:01:30.210> we<00:01:30.360> also<00:01:30.390> find<00:01:30.960> a<00:01:31.080> larger<00:01:31.470> conduit<00:01:31.860> to

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
that we also find a larger conduit to

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.000 
that we also find a larger conduit to
channel<00:01:32.640> the<00:01:32.790> energy<00:01:33.210> our<00:01:34.140> operatives<00:01:34.890> in

channel the energy our operatives in

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:37.370 
channel the energy our operatives in
America<00:01:35.550> have<00:01:35.700> informed<00:01:36.240> us<00:01:36.330> that<00:01:36.540> the<00:01:37.020> US

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
America have informed us that the US

have a large supply of the element at

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.620 
have a large supply of the element at
the<00:01:40.110> Nevada<00:01:40.440> base<00:01:40.820> so<00:01:41.820> time<00:01:42.150> is<00:01:42.450> of<00:01:42.480> the
