00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:06.600 
but so I don't know if it was the

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:08.300 
but so I don't know if it was the
Hairston<00:03:07.080> with<00:03:07.200> that<00:03:07.320> helped<00:03:07.530> kind<00:03:07.830> of<00:03:07.950> loosen

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
Hairston with that helped kind of loosen

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:11.090 
Hairston with that helped kind of loosen
up<00:03:08.520> the<00:03:09.209> tangles<00:03:09.690> and<00:03:09.959> the<00:03:10.560> whole<00:03:10.709> big<00:03:11.070> thing

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:11.100 
up the tangles and the whole big thing

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:14.510 
up the tangles and the whole big thing
all<00:03:11.430> that<00:03:11.610> better<00:03:11.850> I<00:03:12.800> don't<00:03:13.800> know<00:03:13.890> it's<00:03:14.220> just<00:03:14.340> a

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:14.520 
all that better I don't know it's just a

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:16.670 
all that better I don't know it's just a
theory<00:03:14.790> so<00:03:15.420> don't<00:03:15.600> quote<00:03:15.720> me<00:03:15.870> on<00:03:15.900> that<00:03:15.989> but<00:03:16.380> I

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
theory so don't quote me on that but I

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:18.830 
theory so don't quote me on that but I
plan<00:03:16.980> on<00:03:17.220> like<00:03:17.459> after<00:03:17.760> using<00:03:18.000> it<00:03:18.180> again<00:03:18.510> um

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840 
plan on like after using it again um

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:22.970 
plan on like after using it again um
just<00:03:19.830> to<00:03:20.010> see<00:03:20.300> if<00:03:21.300> that's<00:03:21.600> really<00:03:21.810> true<00:03:21.980> you

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:22.980 
just to see if that's really true you

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:27.590 
just to see if that's really true you
know<00:03:23.239> um<00:03:24.239> but<00:03:24.690> so<00:03:24.840> far<00:03:25.110> I<00:03:25.410> do<00:03:25.500> like<00:03:25.830> it<00:03:26.120> um<00:03:27.120> this

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:27.600 
know um but so far I do like it um this

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:30.380 
know um but so far I do like it um this
is<00:03:27.780> just<00:03:27.930> based<00:03:28.140> on<00:03:28.290> the<00:03:28.410> first<00:03:28.650> time<00:03:28.890> use<00:03:29.160> so<00:03:29.880> I

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:30.390 
is just based on the first time use so I

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:31.790 
is just based on the first time use so I
just<00:03:30.660> beating<00:03:30.930> on<00:03:31.050> my<00:03:31.110> hair<00:03:31.290> putting<00:03:31.590> the

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:31.800 
just beating on my hair putting the

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:33.740 
just beating on my hair putting the
twist<00:03:32.100> so<00:03:32.459> I<00:03:32.489> keep<00:03:32.760> it<00:03:32.910> in<00:03:32.940> my<00:03:33.000> sections<00:03:33.510> and

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:33.750 
twist so I keep it in my sections and

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:35.840 
twist so I keep it in my sections and
I'm<00:03:33.900> gonna<00:03:34.050> rinse<00:03:34.230> the<00:03:34.380> conditioner<00:03:34.500> out<00:03:34.850> but

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:35.850 
I'm gonna rinse the conditioner out but

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:37.760 
I'm gonna rinse the conditioner out but
so<00:03:35.970> far<00:03:36.150> the<00:03:36.330> hair<00:03:36.480> steamer<00:03:36.720> seems<00:03:37.140> like<00:03:37.530> a

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:37.770 
so far the hair steamer seems like a
