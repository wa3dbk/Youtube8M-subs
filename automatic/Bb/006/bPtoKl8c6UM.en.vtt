00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:05.970
 I have 

00:00:10.199 --> 00:00:13.579
 Hi everyone I am a fan of saffron yellow welcome to our kitchen 

00:00:13.579 --> 00:00:18.079
 to prepare the plum jam together and it's true 

00:00:18.079 --> 00:00:21.519
 this is a jam that you can easily use in the morning 

00:00:21.519 --> 00:00:25.249
 like breakfast on toasted bread or to make some 

00:00:25.249 --> 00:00:29.119
 fantastic tarts why not post them add to seasoned cheeses but 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:32.400
 let's see the cacio curno ingredients together 

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:34.760
 the juice of a squeezed lemon 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:36.610
 a pound of sugar 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:41.860
 a kilo of pitted black plums and 30 grams of ginger root well de 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:44.860
 paganis and free plum jam 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.980
 first we need to wash it by pitting and cutting into quarters 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:53.700
 prunes 

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:59.300
 then we have to bucciarelli ginger finely grate as you can see 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:02.300
 at this point you can put everything in the pot 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:06.050
 let's start with him 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.280
 we combine grated ginger if you believe it used peel like my mother 

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:16.090
 the juice of a lemon 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:19.090
 - - 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.220
 at this point 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.210
 we cook the vacuum very sweet fire feel tuning will be completely 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.210
 pulped 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:37.420
 as you can see lie to me they have been crushed more than 20 minutes have passed on fire 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:38.530
 bass 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:43.150
 hours sparrow and all because I want to keep a smooth jam but if you want 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:47.040
 prefer the jam with the torrent pieces do not pass everything left 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.920
 so to cook until everything is ready and good text 

00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:59.500
 Facebook 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:03.130
 and here is how you see I got all the ingredients got one 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:04.460
 beautiful sciacca sauce 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:06.229
 now there will be nothing else left 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:09.519
 to cook everything on a fairly gentle heat 

00:02:09.519 --> 00:02:11.450
 It is a necessary period for us to 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:13.100
 everything becomes must 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:16.450
 so I think that dipping a spoon letting a drop fall 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:20.310
 on a reclining plate the shower does not leave the trail but remains instead 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:21.599
 circular 

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:25.020
 at that moment our jam will obviously be ready 

00:02:25.689 --> 00:02:30.240
 while everything here is also necessary to foam, ie to remove that 

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:33.430
 half white cost that forms on the surface and asks would render 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:36.749
 otherwise it is quite cloudy 

00:02:36.749 --> 00:02:39.749
 in this way instead it will be crystal clear 

00:02:40.549 --> 00:02:42.219
 there remains therefore 

00:02:42.219 --> 00:02:45.219
 if you let cook as much as you are 

00:02:48.399 --> 00:02:50.700
 it took about half an hour 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:54.270
 but as a lookout already done the test by dipping the spoon and releasing 

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:55.429
 a drop 

00:02:55.429 --> 00:02:57.269
 of jam on 

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:01.080
 29 of the time remains firm and does not make any wake 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:02.930
 so you're afraid to eat 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:04.309
 at this point 

00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:09.279
 we take hey grass sterilized septa you can do it by putting in the naphtha ville 

00:03:09.279 --> 00:03:13.129
 you can boil them in the water to use even the microwave oven for a couple of 

00:03:13.129 --> 00:03:15.169
 minutes at maximum power 

00:03:15.169 --> 00:03:18.619
 after which then we go to fill them 

00:03:18.619 --> 00:03:22.789
 as you can see I am using a funnel for key jams a lot 

00:03:22.789 --> 00:03:23.679
 wide 

00:03:23.679 --> 00:03:26.679
 once it is said it will be full 

00:03:28.029 --> 00:03:29.109
 we will 

00:03:29.109 --> 00:03:34.039
 the lid we will tighten well 3 the tip evoque so we will not leave 

00:03:34.039 --> 00:03:37.039
 cool and the vacuum will form 

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:45.569
 when the jars have completely cooled you will have to e 

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:48.900
 practically to verify if the vacuum has been created 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:52.769
 crushing the center of your lid if you do not feel alcohol 

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:56.620
 vacuum morelli you will have created in the penis it feels that it sucks tic tac 

00:03:57.259 --> 00:04:00.499
 it will mean that the vacuum has not been created perfectly therefore you have to 

00:04:00.499 --> 00:04:04.369
 to put your jars a pot to cover them with waterfredda is to make them 

00:04:04.369 --> 00:04:07.269
 boil for at least an hour then checking 

00:04:07.269 --> 00:04:11.870
 fag. vacuum has now been created so our jam ready for 

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:16.370
 be preserved or because no ja vu was present on some excellent slices 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:17.079
 of bread 

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:18.400
 so the story 

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:21.280
 and saffron yellow a salute to the next video recipe
