model is you can't teleport yeah it was

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.690 
model is you can't teleport yeah it was
a<00:02:03.420> problem<00:02:03.659> well<00:02:04.170> my<00:02:04.679> army<00:02:04.979> has<00:02:05.130> a<00:02:05.159> lot<00:02:05.670> of

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
a problem well my army has a lot of

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.779 
a problem well my army has a lot of
lances<00:02:06.329> and<00:02:06.719> melted<00:02:07.079> weapons<00:02:07.350> but<00:02:08.280> now<00:02:08.610> that

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
lances and melted weapons but now that

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:11.930 
lances and melted weapons but now that
was<00:02:08.879> a<00:02:08.910> really<00:02:09.090> fun<00:02:09.330> game<00:02:09.509> though<00:02:09.569> I<00:02:10.610> think<00:02:11.610> the

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
was a really fun game though I think the

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.820 
was a really fun game though I think the
I<00:02:12.420> think<00:02:12.750> the<00:02:12.810> biggest<00:02:12.959> weakness<00:02:13.349> of<00:02:13.470> the<00:02:13.620> list

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
I think the biggest weakness of the list

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.400 
I think the biggest weakness of the list
is<00:02:14.069> I<00:02:14.700> had<00:02:15.180> way<00:02:15.420> more<00:02:15.450> wood<00:02:15.840> units<00:02:16.170> than<00:02:16.260> you

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
is I had way more wood units than you

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:18.860 
is I had way more wood units than you
did<00:02:16.590> right<00:02:17.129> so<00:02:17.400> it<00:02:17.760> was<00:02:17.910> hard<00:02:17.940> for<00:02:18.269> you<00:02:18.360> to<00:02:18.480> take

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
did right so it was hard for you to take

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:20.720 
did right so it was hard for you to take
him<00:02:19.019> out<00:02:19.110> the<00:02:19.410> Harley's<00:02:19.769> oh<00:02:20.040> yeah<00:02:20.280> i<00:02:20.519> forgot<00:02:20.610> to

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
far as me far as Reese what I would have

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.120 
far as me far as Reese what I would have
done<00:02:32.489> differently<00:02:33.290> that<00:02:34.290> give<00:02:34.530> backup<00:02:34.890> role

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 
done differently that give backup role

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:38.059 
done differently that give backup role
with<00:02:35.310> you<00:02:35.420> with<00:02:36.420> the<00:02:36.599> necrons<00:02:37.530> now<00:02:37.709> is<00:02:37.860> really

00:02:38.059 --> 00:02:38.069 
with you with the necrons now is really

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:40.130 
with you with the necrons now is really
good<00:02:38.280> I<00:02:38.519> wouldn't<00:02:39.180> even<00:02:39.269> bother<00:02:39.569> shooting

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
good I wouldn't even bother shooting

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:41.750 
good I wouldn't even bother shooting
trails<00:02:40.440> he<00:02:40.680> would<00:02:40.890> have<00:02:40.980> just<00:02:41.160> assaulted<00:02:41.610> with

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
trails he would have just assaulted with

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:42.860 
trails he would have just assaulted with
the<00:02:41.849> Holocaust<00:02:42.269> I<00:02:42.420> think<00:02:42.599> they<00:02:42.660> could<00:02:42.780> have

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
the Holocaust I think they could have

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:46.780 
the Holocaust I think they could have
killed<00:02:43.019> him<00:02:43.200> yeah<00:02:43.470> um<00:02:43.860> other<00:02:44.819> than<00:02:44.910> that<00:02:45.110> I

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:46.790 
killed him yeah um other than that I

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:48.830 
killed him yeah um other than that I
think<00:02:47.790> I<00:02:48.090> maybe<00:02:48.239> would<00:02:48.480> have<00:02:48.510> played<00:02:48.690> a<00:02:48.720> little

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
think I maybe would have played a little

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.059 
think I maybe would have played a little
bit<00:02:48.989> more<00:02:49.079> aggressively<00:02:49.470> and<00:02:49.620> gone<00:02:49.709> after<00:02:49.860> the

00:02:50.059 --> 00:02:50.069 
bit more aggressively and gone after the

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:52.970 
bit more aggressively and gone after the
mana<00:02:50.280> was<00:02:50.720> um<00:02:51.720> I<00:02:51.780> kind<00:02:52.349> of<00:02:52.380> home<00:02:52.530> I<00:02:52.680> kind<00:02:52.920> of

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980 
mana was um I kind of home I kind of

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:54.289 
mana was um I kind of home I kind of
hung<00:02:53.130> out<00:02:53.250> my<00:02:53.400> army<00:02:53.610> in<00:02:53.700> the<00:02:53.730> middle<00:02:54.000> okay<00:02:54.090> yeah

he's gonna shine with those tracks is
pretty<00:03:08.340> damn<00:03:08.519> good<00:03:08.700> because<00:03:09.540> he<00:03:09.660> can<00:03:09.810> soak<00:03:10.019> up

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
pretty damn good because he can soak up

thought Allah this whole book is
surprised<00:03:40.319> me<00:03:40.470> there<00:03:40.620> was<00:03:40.709> a<00:03:40.769> lot<00:03:40.920> of<00:03:40.950> stuff<00:03:41.190> in

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 
surprised me there was a lot of stuff in

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:42.440 
surprised me there was a lot of stuff in
here<00:03:41.370> that<00:03:41.489> I<00:03:41.700> didn't<00:03:41.970> think<00:03:42.000> was<00:03:42.150> gonna<00:03:42.329> be

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:42.450 
here that I didn't think was gonna be

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:45.259 
here that I didn't think was gonna be
any<00:03:42.569> good<00:03:42.630> at<00:03:42.870> first<00:03:43.079> and<00:03:43.819> it's<00:03:44.819> there's<00:03:45.120> like

00:03:45.259 --> 00:03:45.269 
any good at first and it's there's like

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:46.729 
any good at first and it's there's like
a<00:03:45.299> lot<00:03:45.450> of<00:03:45.480> little<00:03:45.660> tricky<00:03:45.930> combos<00:03:46.349> you<00:03:46.470> can<00:03:46.590> do

00:03:46.729 --> 00:03:46.739 
a lot of little tricky combos you can do

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:49.099 
a lot of little tricky combos you can do
I<00:03:46.950> think<00:03:47.549> it's<00:03:47.639> an<00:03:47.730> army<00:03:48.000> that<00:03:48.239> is<00:03:48.510> very<00:03:48.930> easy

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:49.109 
I think it's an army that is very easy

00:03:49.109 --> 00:03:50.780 
I think it's an army that is very easy
to<00:03:49.230> make<00:03:49.380> a<00:03:49.410> bad<00:03:49.620> list<00:03:49.919> but<00:03:50.310> if<00:03:50.370> you're<00:03:50.489> a<00:03:50.579> good

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:50.790 
to make a bad list but if you're a good

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:53.839 
to make a bad list but if you're a good
list<00:03:51.030> builder<00:03:51.799> in<00:03:52.799> a<00:03:52.859> good<00:03:53.010> player<00:03:53.220> this<00:03:53.700> is

00:03:53.839 --> 00:03:53.849 
list builder in a good player this is

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:55.370 
list builder in a good player this is
Army's<00:03:54.150> really<00:03:54.480> fun<00:03:54.720> because<00:03:54.930> there's<00:03:55.200> a<00:03:55.260> lot

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:55.380 
Army's really fun because there's a lot

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:56.420 
Army's really fun because there's a lot
of<00:03:55.410> depth<00:03:55.680> to<00:03:55.799> it<00:03:55.950> there's<00:03:56.280> a<00:03:56.310> lot<00:03:56.370> of
