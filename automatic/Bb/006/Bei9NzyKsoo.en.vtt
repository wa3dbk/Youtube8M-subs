to<00:03:54.690> review<00:03:55.110> properly<00:03:55.970> what<00:03:56.970> I<00:03:57.000> like<00:03:57.209> about<00:03:57.329> it

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:57.480 
to review properly what I like about it

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:59.330 
to review properly what I like about it
is<00:03:57.570> they've<00:03:57.750> they've<00:03:58.079> retained<00:03:58.650> a<00:03:58.920> 16

00:03:59.330 --> 00:03:59.340 
is they've they've retained a 16

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:01.190 
is they've they've retained a 16
megapixel<00:03:59.489> sensor<00:04:00.420> which<00:04:00.600> is<00:04:00.630> what<00:04:00.900> I've<00:04:01.019> got

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:01.200 
megapixel sensor which is what I've got

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:03.890 
megapixel sensor which is what I've got
in<00:04:01.350> here<00:04:01.380> so<00:04:01.860> my<00:04:02.010> dear<00:04:02.420> d7000<00:04:03.420> is<00:04:03.540> 16

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:03.900 
in here so my dear d7000 is 16

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:07.670 
in here so my dear d7000 is 16
megapixels<00:04:04.590> my<00:04:05.400> GX<00:04:05.730> 1<00:04:05.910> is<00:04:06.030> 16<00:04:06.299> megapixels<00:04:07.079> my

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:07.680 
megapixels my GX 1 is 16 megapixels my

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:09.680 
megapixels my GX 1 is 16 megapixels my
file<00:04:07.950> sizes<00:04:08.250> are<00:04:08.430> all<00:04:08.670> sort<00:04:09.030> of<00:04:09.090> similar<00:04:09.420> sizes

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:09.690 
file sizes are all sort of similar sizes

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:11.960 
file sizes are all sort of similar sizes
which<00:04:10.079> is<00:04:10.260> nice<00:04:10.470> and<00:04:10.829> it<00:04:11.220> still<00:04:11.430> works<00:04:11.670> nicely

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:11.970 
which is nice and it still works nicely

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:14.390 
which is nice and it still works nicely
for<00:04:12.150> me<00:04:12.299> and<00:04:12.750> I<00:04:13.260> like<00:04:13.440> the<00:04:13.620> fact<00:04:13.799> that<00:04:14.010> they've

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:14.400 
for me and I like the fact that they've

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:16.909 
for me and I like the fact that they've
the<00:04:15.030> GX<00:04:15.390> 7<00:04:15.600> they've<00:04:15.900> kept<00:04:16.229> with<00:04:16.380> that<00:04:16.500> 16

00:04:16.909 --> 00:04:16.919 
the GX 7 they've kept with that 16

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:19.219 
the GX 7 they've kept with that 16
megapixel<00:04:17.519> zoom<00:04:17.820> in<00:04:17.940> my<00:04:18.060> opinion<00:04:18.479> unless

00:04:19.219 --> 00:04:19.229 
megapixel zoom in my opinion unless

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:22.219 
megapixel zoom in my opinion unless
you're<00:04:19.590> printing<00:04:20.570> eight-foot<00:04:21.570> posters<00:04:22.049> you

00:04:22.219 --> 00:04:22.229 
you're printing eight-foot posters you

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:24.050 
you're printing eight-foot posters you
really<00:04:22.560> don't<00:04:22.740> need<00:04:22.979> any<00:04:23.430> more<00:04:23.760> megapixels

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:24.060 
really don't need any more megapixels

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:26.100 
really don't need any more megapixels
than<00:04:24.539> there

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:26.110 
than there

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:29.230 
than there
what<00:04:27.110> else<00:04:27.290> the<00:04:27.860> autofocus<00:04:28.550> system<00:04:28.850> is

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:29.240 
what else the autofocus system is

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:31.780 
what else the autofocus system is
similar<00:04:29.630> to<00:04:29.780> that<00:04:29.960> it's<00:04:30.170> fantastic

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:31.790 
similar to that it's fantastic

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:34.300 
similar to that it's fantastic
it's<00:04:32.630> a<00:04:32.840> fairly<00:04:33.170> fast<00:04:33.350> camera<00:04:33.770> it<00:04:33.980> can<00:04:34.100> do<00:04:34.220> up

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:34.310 
it's a fairly fast camera it can do up

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:36.670 
it's a fairly fast camera it can do up
to<00:04:34.340> five<00:04:34.580> frames<00:04:34.850> per<00:04:35.060> second<00:04:35.570> the<00:04:35.960> ISRO

to five frames per second the ISRO
it<00:04:36.890> states<00:04:37.280> as<00:04:37.490> one<00:04:37.640> twenty<00:04:37.910> five<00:04:38.060> to<00:04:38.270> twenty

five thousand six hundred that's all

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:42.250 
five thousand six hundred that's all
nonsense<00:04:40.340> why<00:04:41.330> cameras<00:04:41.750> I<00:04:41.840> have<00:04:41.930> twenty<00:04:42.140> five

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:42.260

I've<00:04:57.410> got<00:04:57.650> problem<00:04:57.890> with<00:04:58.040> that<00:04:59.860> well

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:00.860 
I've got problem with that well

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:03.010 
I've got problem with that well
obviously<00:05:01.130> you've<00:05:01.460> got<00:05:01.490> raw<00:05:01.880> you've<00:05:02.720> got<00:05:02.840> some

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:03.020 
obviously you've got raw you've got some

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:06.550 
obviously you've got raw you've got some
decent<00:05:03.230> video<00:05:03.740> AVC<00:05:04.700> HD<00:05:04.850> in<00:05:05.150> mp4<00:05:05.480> you've<00:05:06.440> got<00:05:06.530> a

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:06.560 
decent video AVC HD in mp4 you've got a

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:09.720 
decent video AVC HD in mp4 you've got a
nice<00:05:06.830> screen<00:05:07.280> and<00:05:07.760> it's<00:05:07.940> a<00:05:08.060> flippy<00:05:08.390> screen

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:09.730 
nice screen and it's a flippy screen

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:13.120 
nice screen and it's a flippy screen
yeah<00:05:10.730> so<00:05:11.060> it's<00:05:11.630> I<00:05:12.230> wouldn't<00:05:12.830> say<00:05:12.950> it's<00:05:13.070> a

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:13.130 
yeah so it's I wouldn't say it's a

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:14.500 
yeah so it's I wouldn't say it's a
revolutionary<00:05:13.700> thing<00:05:13.940> it's<00:05:14.120> more<00:05:14.330> of<00:05:14.420> an

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:14.510 
revolutionary thing it's more of an

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:16.390 
revolutionary thing it's more of an
evolution<00:05:14.780> it<00:05:15.200> seems<00:05:15.500> to<00:05:15.680> me<00:05:15.860> like<00:05:16.010> what

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:16.400 
evolution it seems to me like what

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:18.010 
evolution it seems to me like what
they've<00:05:16.550> done<00:05:16.730> is<00:05:16.880> they've<00:05:17.150> firstly<00:05:17.930> that

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:18.020 
they've done is they've firstly that

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:19.660 
they've done is they've firstly that
made<00:05:18.170> it<00:05:18.260> look<00:05:18.380> like<00:05:18.560> the<00:05:18.680> Sony<00:05:18.890> NEX<00:05:19.100> system

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:19.670 
made it look like the Sony NEX system

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:20.710 
made it look like the Sony NEX system
because<00:05:19.850> obviously<00:05:19.970> that's<00:05:20.270> really<00:05:20.540> popular

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:20.720 
because obviously that's really popular

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:23.560 
because obviously that's really popular
that's<00:05:21.050> a<00:05:21.170> stunning<00:05:21.440> system<00:05:22.150> but<00:05:23.150> really<00:05:23.300> what

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:23.570 
that's a stunning system but really what

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:25.030 
that's a stunning system but really what
they've<00:05:23.690> done<00:05:23.810> is<00:05:23.960> I've<00:05:24.080> taken<00:05:24.110> the<00:05:24.470> GX<00:05:24.770> one

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:25.040 
they've done is I've taken the GX one

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:26.530 
they've done is I've taken the GX one
and<00:05:25.370> they<00:05:25.460> thought<00:05:25.640> well<00:05:25.790> where<00:05:25.970> can<00:05:26.180> we<00:05:26.300> put

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:26.540 
and they thought well where can we put

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:28.000 
and they thought well where can we put
the<00:05:26.720> viewfinder<00:05:26.930> so<00:05:27.530> they've<00:05:27.680> made<00:05:27.860> it

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:28.010 
the viewfinder so they've made it

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:31.060 
the viewfinder so they've made it
slightly<00:05:28.130> longer<00:05:28.580> and<00:05:28.940> wider<00:05:29.410> and<00:05:30.410> then<00:05:30.680> put

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:31.070 
slightly longer and wider and then put

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:33.850 
slightly longer and wider and then put
the<00:05:31.220> viewfinder<00:05:31.790> on<00:05:31.820> the<00:05:32.030> corner<00:05:32.620> which<00:05:33.620> is

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:33.860 
the viewfinder on the corner which is

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:36.670 
the viewfinder on the corner which is
again<00:05:34.400> you<00:05:34.490> know<00:05:34.610> it's<00:05:34.760> a<00:05:34.850> nice<00:05:34.970> feature<00:05:35.680> but

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:36.680 
again you know it's a nice feature but

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:38.440 
again you know it's a nice feature but
this<00:05:37.040> does<00:05:37.250> everything<00:05:37.550> that<00:05:37.730> that<00:05:38.090> does<00:05:38.300> I

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:38.450 
this does everything that that does I

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:40.840 
this does everything that that does I
mean<00:05:38.600> I<00:05:38.810> can<00:05:39.260> flip<00:05:39.530> flip<00:05:40.010> my<00:05:40.130> viewfinder<00:05:40.400> up

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:40.850 
mean I can flip flip my viewfinder up

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:42.880
