00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:08.960
 good is a new mario gameplay 

00:00:06.379 --> 00:00:11.900
 kart wii here we see that he sees castle 

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:12.589
 with being 3 you will see that during the 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:15.679
 gameplay 

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:17.970
 it's going to be pretty mediocre enough 

00:00:15.679 --> 00:00:22.650
 mediocre I'm going to do it 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:25.079
 let's say more badly I do not know if I'm going to do what 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.080
 bad I'm going to have bad luck but let's go 

00:00:25.079 --> 00:00:28.990
 what 

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:33.070
 my intention let's say was to focus on 

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:35.710
 see if you could get out if they could get me out 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:37.480
 the shortcut that surely all 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:40.360
 you will know and if I am not going to leave you 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:44.220
 annotation top left with a 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:46.809
 video of me in which he teaches how to do the 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:49.570
 shortcut here we see that I do not get out and I fall 

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:52.680
 to the lava and well then if I go I'm going tenth 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:52.680
 I'm going last 

00:00:55.769 --> 00:00:59.910
 even threw a ray 

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:03.510
 silva the right now 

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:10.560
 and some of you are going to ask and for 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:12.820
 what will not be understood with display with you 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:16.360
 making the potatoes 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:20.620
 Well, it's a gameplay that, as I do not 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:24.130
 has an epic epic ending if maybe 

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:26.470
 I can call it epic I do not know but you go 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:28.920
 to see what you're going to see in the end you're going to 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:28.920
 see at the end 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:33.700
 and in the end that peak you will see 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:36.789
 final surprise me 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:41.079
 You see, I'm going fifth between the quarters 

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:45.399
 fifth fifths the best sevenths who 

00:01:41.079 --> 00:01:46.990
 know but the truth go ahead what 

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:49.689
 it would be forward 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:52.810
 I'm not going I'm not going in the whole game I'm not going 

00:01:49.689 --> 00:01:55.479
 ahead and much less I'm always with 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:57.850
 the heap or even behind the heap 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:02:00.840
 put it in some way 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:05.359
 so that's good 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:07.350
 well this is one is a sample that 

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:10.920
 being of the heap 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:13.110
 you can also can win says clear 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:15.390
 clear if the end is epic I will win 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:18.440
 how will I not win 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:21.770
 the end is epic 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:24.120
 but but being of the pile also it 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:26.970
 can win 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:28.830
 a little bit of luck a little bit of risk 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:31.290
 sometimes also 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:34.319
 you have to risk one who does not 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:36.450
 risk does not win 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:39.709
 and well, especially when you're in 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:42.209
 these moments that you feel the heap 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:46.560
 you have to take a chance if you go first to 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:50.069
 the best you should preserve a little 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:53.630
 your integrity here we see last round 

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:56.150
 I'm going fifth, I have a mushroom and 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:59.480
 I put myself first I put myself first 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:00.830
 lack of very few laps to the end 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:05.390
 of the career 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:07.700
 yes yes quite epic, I can prove it 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:09.800
 once in the first round no power 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:12.860
 try it in the second try it the 

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:16.970
 third in my fifth position and what is 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:18.350
 what I get this way Galician
