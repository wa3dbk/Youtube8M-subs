00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
which I I don't think it's fair because

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.180 
which I I don't think it's fair because
I've<00:00:12.780> already<00:00:12.929> defeated<00:00:13.410> it<00:00:13.679> why<00:00:13.889> do<00:00:13.950> I<00:00:14.099> need

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
I've already defeated it why do I need

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.369 
I've already defeated it why do I need
to<00:00:14.370> burn<00:00:14.610> it<00:00:14.759> to<00:00:14.849> the<00:00:14.910> ground<00:00:15.000> but<00:00:15.990> then<00:00:16.139> I<00:00:16.170> had

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
to burn it to the ground but then I had

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:18.769 
to burn it to the ground but then I had
an<00:00:16.470> interesting<00:00:16.680> idea<00:00:16.980> which<00:00:17.880> was<00:00:18.119> what<00:00:18.600> if<00:00:18.690> i

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
an interesting idea which was what if i

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:21.490 
an interesting idea which was what if i
took<00:00:18.840> this<00:00:19.109> switch<00:00:19.770> for<00:00:20.160> the<00:00:20.189> door<00:00:20.520> and<00:00:20.789> if<00:00:21.270> i

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:21.500 
took this switch for the door and if i

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:25.370 
took this switch for the door and if i
accidentally<00:00:22.500> burned<00:00:22.949> it<00:00:23.960> leaving<00:00:24.960> my<00:00:25.080> only

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
accidentally burned it leaving my only

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.890 
accidentally burned it leaving my only
way<00:00:25.859> out<00:00:25.890> of<00:00:26.130> this<00:00:26.310> burning<00:00:26.760> building<00:00:27.330> to<00:00:27.539> be

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
way out of this burning building to be

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.080 
way out of this burning building to be
to<00:00:28.080> actually<00:00:28.230> complete<00:00:28.980> the<00:00:29.160> course<00:00:29.640> before

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
to actually complete the course before

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.560 
to actually complete the course before
the<00:00:30.539> burn<00:00:30.750> building<00:00:31.410> burns<00:00:31.679> to<00:00:31.949> the<00:00:31.980> ground<00:00:32.570> so

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
the burn building burns to the ground so

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
I thought hey let's give that a try now

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.180 
I thought hey let's give that a try now
i'm<00:00:37.620> not<00:00:38.070> sure<00:00:38.550> if<00:00:38.850> i'm<00:00:39.059> going<00:00:39.210> to<00:00:39.300> have<00:00:39.480> enough

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:40.190 
i'm not sure if i'm going to have enough

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:48.529 
i'm not sure if i'm going to have enough
time<00:00:41.190> oh<00:00:43.219> shoot<00:00:44.219> ok<00:00:46.850> to<00:00:47.850> make<00:00:48.030> all<00:00:48.300> of<00:00:48.329> these

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
time oh shoot ok to make all of these

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:51.319 
time oh shoot ok to make all of these
jumps<00:00:49.110> because<00:00:49.230> i'm<00:00:49.440> not<00:00:49.620> sure<00:00:49.860> how<00:00:50.250> fast<00:00:50.610> the

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
jumps because i'm not sure how fast the

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.020 
jumps because i'm not sure how fast the
fire<00:00:51.629> is<00:00:52.110> going<00:00:52.379> to<00:00:52.469> spread<00:00:52.829> plus<00:00:53.820> i<00:00:54.000> don't
