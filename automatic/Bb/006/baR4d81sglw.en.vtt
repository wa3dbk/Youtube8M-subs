00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
on some texts it might be a mix of you

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.220 
on some texts it might be a mix of you
know<00:00:29.400> both<00:00:29.640> it<00:00:29.880> might<00:00:30.449> even<00:00:30.599> have<00:00:30.840> you<00:00:31.109> know

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
know both it might even have you know

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:32.810 
know both it might even have you know
mix<00:00:31.470> it<00:00:31.619> both<00:00:31.740> and<00:00:31.949> then<00:00:32.040> you<00:00:32.189> know<00:00:32.340> one<00:00:32.550> or<00:00:32.700> two

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
mix it both and then you know one or two

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.940 
mix it both and then you know one or two
spots<00:00:33.270> or<00:00:33.510> stuff<00:00:33.690> like<00:00:33.840> that<00:00:33.899> so<00:00:34.590> I<00:00:34.620> think<00:00:34.829> it's

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
spots or stuff like that so I think it's

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:36.889 
spots or stuff like that so I think it's
going<00:00:35.100> to<00:00:35.190> be<00:00:35.309> a<00:00:35.340> really<00:00:35.910> cool<00:00:36.180> series<00:00:36.540> and<00:00:36.780> I'm

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
from C domination point to be domination

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:46.850 
from C domination point to be domination
point<00:00:45.809> and<00:00:45.989> the<00:00:46.079> reason<00:00:46.350> that<00:00:46.379> I<00:00:46.530> like<00:00:46.710> this

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
point and the reason that I like this

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.770 
point and the reason that I like this
grenade<00:00:47.309> is<00:00:47.520> because<00:00:47.940> Doyle<00:00:48.270> related<00:00:48.660> from

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
grenade is because Doyle related from

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.720 
grenade is because Doyle related from
this<00:00:48.960> area<00:00:49.320> to<00:00:49.559> be<00:00:49.860> domination<00:00:50.399> point<00:00:50.610> has

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
this area to be domination point has

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.639 
this area to be domination point has
always<00:00:50.969> been<00:00:51.090> a<00:00:51.149> struggle<00:00:51.480> and<00:00:51.840> with<00:00:52.260> this<00:00:52.410> one

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
always been a struggle and with this one

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.799 
always been a struggle and with this one
it<00:00:52.860> makes<00:00:53.010> it<00:00:53.219> far<00:00:53.460> easier<00:00:53.730> so<00:00:54.510> you<00:00:54.570> want<00:00:54.750> a

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
it makes it far easier so you want a

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.990 
it makes it far easier so you want a
position<00:00:55.170> reticle<00:00:55.559> over<00:00:55.829> this<00:00:56.070> red<00:00:56.520> doorway

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
position reticle over this red doorway

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.090 
position reticle over this red doorway
throw<00:00:57.750> it<00:00:57.960> and<00:00:58.109> it<00:00:58.260> should<00:00:58.289> bounce<00:00:58.680> right<00:00:59.039> off

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
throw it and it should bounce right off

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.490 
throw it and it should bounce right off
the<00:00:59.820> tower<00:01:00.239> in<00:01:00.600> the<00:01:00.629> middle<00:01:00.750> of<00:01:00.989> the<00:01:01.050> map<00:01:01.289> and

the tower in the middle of the map and

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.889 
the tower in the middle of the map and
the<00:01:02.010> angle<00:01:02.309> the<00:01:02.460> tower<00:01:02.670> wall<00:01:03.030> makes<00:01:03.600> it<00:01:03.719> land

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
the angle the tower wall makes it land

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:05.719 
the angle the tower wall makes it land
right<00:01:04.080> on<00:01:04.110> be<00:01:04.379> as<00:01:04.650> we<00:01:05.100> take<00:01:05.250> a<00:01:05.280> look<00:01:05.460> here<00:01:05.519> in

right on be as we take a look here in

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.370 
right on be as we take a look here in
third<00:01:06.030> person<00:01:06.270> you'll<00:01:06.600> see<00:01:06.750> it<00:01:06.840> bounces<00:01:07.170> right

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
third person you'll see it bounces right

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.530 
third person you'll see it bounces right
off<00:01:07.439> that<00:01:07.770> too<00:01:08.070> and<00:01:08.310> then<00:01:08.790> goes<00:01:09.000> right<00:01:09.270> on<00:01:09.420> the

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
off that too and then goes right on the

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.090 
off that too and then goes right on the
be<00:01:09.689> dominating<00:01:10.260> point<00:01:10.530> it's<00:01:10.710> a<00:01:10.740> very<00:01:11.010> good

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
be dominating point it's a very good

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.039 
be dominating point it's a very good
need<00:01:11.760> and<00:01:12.000> it's<00:01:12.420> one<00:01:12.570> that<00:01:12.689> if<00:01:12.840> you<00:01:12.930> has

need and it's one that if you has

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.560 
need and it's one that if you has
learned<00:01:13.380> should<00:01:13.979> be<00:01:14.100> very<00:01:14.400> very<00:01:14.580> useful<00:01:14.939> so

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
learned should be very very useful so

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.469 
learned should be very very useful so
anyways<00:01:16.560> this<00:01:16.799> next<00:01:17.189> frag<00:01:17.490> is<00:01:17.700> also<00:01:18.240> on<00:01:18.450> that

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
anyways this next frag is also on that

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.230 
anyways this next frag is also on that
firing<00:01:19.110> range<00:01:19.290> you<00:01:19.799> take<00:01:19.979> a<00:01:20.009> look<00:01:20.250> here<00:01:20.610> you

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
firing range you take a look here you

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.330 
firing range you take a look here you
throw<00:01:21.540> it<00:01:21.659> from<00:01:21.780> top<00:01:22.080> would<00:01:22.439> you'll<00:01:22.979> see<00:01:23.159> that

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
throw it from top would you'll see that

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.340 
throw it from top would you'll see that
my<00:01:23.430> reticle<00:01:23.909> goes<00:01:24.180> pretty<00:01:24.570> much<00:01:24.840> all<00:01:25.080> the<00:01:25.259> way

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
my reticle goes pretty much all the way

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.679 
my reticle goes pretty much all the way
up<00:01:25.560> but<00:01:26.130> you<00:01:26.250> wanted<00:01:26.610> what<00:01:27.240> you<00:01:27.330> want<00:01:27.509> to<00:01:27.570> do

there<00:01:47.220> throw<00:01:47.670> it<00:01:47.850> it<00:01:48.420> does<00:01:48.570> take<00:01:48.750> a<00:01:48.780> little<00:01:48.960> bit

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
there throw it it does take a little bit

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.289 
there throw it it does take a little bit
to<00:01:49.380> to<00:01:49.770> detonate<00:01:50.189> but<00:01:50.430> all<00:01:50.880> in<00:01:51.000> all<00:01:51.060> it's<00:01:51.240> a

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
pretty useful made so anyways this is

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.160 
pretty useful made so anyways this is

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
it should land right on B and this is

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.429 
it should land right on B and this is
one<00:02:05.850> that<00:02:05.969> a<00:02:06.060> lot<00:02:06.240> of<00:02:06.270> people<00:02:06.420> know<00:02:06.659> but

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
one that a lot of people know but

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:08.960 
one that a lot of people know but
nonetheless<00:02:07.649> it's<00:02:08.069> useful<00:02:08.489> to<00:02:08.580> give<00:02:08.729> you<00:02:08.819> as

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
nonetheless it's useful to give you as

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:10.400 
nonetheless it's useful to give you as
kind<00:02:09.119> of<00:02:09.209> a<00:02:09.330> visual<00:02:09.509> cue<00:02:10.020> and<00:02:10.140> you<00:02:10.200> saw<00:02:10.349> the

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
kind of a visual cue and you saw the

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.350 
kind of a visual cue and you saw the
triangle<00:02:10.979> that<00:02:11.190> was<00:02:11.400> kind<00:02:11.700> of<00:02:11.760> created<00:02:12.150> by<00:02:12.300> the

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
triangle that was kind of created by the

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.490 
triangle that was kind of created by the
palm<00:02:12.720> leaves

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
palm leaves

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.050 
palm leaves
that's<00:02:13.860> a<00:02:13.950> really<00:02:14.220> really<00:02:14.370> good<00:02:14.580> Nate<00:02:14.730> as<00:02:14.880> well

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
that's a really really good Nate as well

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.300 
that's a really really good Nate as well
now<00:02:15.720> this<00:02:15.870> is<00:02:15.930> by<00:02:16.200> far<00:02:16.440> the<00:02:16.500> hardest<00:02:16.650> Canadian

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
now this is by far the hardest Canadian

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:19.100 
now this is by far the hardest Canadian
that<00:02:17.430> I<00:02:17.460> will<00:02:17.730> ever<00:02:17.760> show<00:02:18.090> you<00:02:18.420> guys<00:02:18.690> but<00:02:18.990> it's

that I will ever show you guys but it's

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:20.720 
that I will ever show you guys but it's
pretty<00:02:19.290> useful<00:02:19.560> if<00:02:19.860> the<00:02:20.010> opponents<00:02:20.400> have<00:02:20.550> your

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
pretty useful if the opponents have your

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:22.490 
pretty useful if the opponents have your
flag<00:02:21.000> what<00:02:21.690> you're<00:02:21.780> going<00:02:21.900> to<00:02:21.960> do<00:02:22.050> is<00:02:22.170> get<00:02:22.350> on

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
flag what you're going to do is get on

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.800 
flag what you're going to do is get on
the<00:02:22.530> railing<00:02:22.950> here<00:02:23.340> and<00:02:23.580> as<00:02:24.090> you<00:02:24.150> sprint<00:02:24.690> up

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
the railing here and as you sprint up

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.840 
the railing here and as you sprint up
and<00:02:25.050> turn<00:02:25.320> position<00:02:26.100> reticle<00:02:26.460> over<00:02:26.670> that

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:26.850 
and turn position reticle over that

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:28.850 
and turn position reticle over that
little<00:02:27.090> top<00:02:27.570> HUD<00:02:27.900> I<00:02:27.930> guess<00:02:28.170> you<00:02:28.290> would<00:02:28.410> say<00:02:28.440> and

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
little top HUD I guess you would say and

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:30.590 
little top HUD I guess you would say and
it<00:02:29.280> lands<00:02:29.460> right<00:02:29.760> on<00:02:29.790> the<00:02:30.000> opponent's<00:02:30.240> fly

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:30.600 
it lands right on the opponent's fly

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.870 
it lands right on the opponent's fly
just<00:02:31.080> in<00:02:31.230> case<00:02:31.380> they're<00:02:31.440> about<00:02:31.800> to<00:02:32.010> cap<00:02:32.250> it<00:02:32.280> as

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880 
just in case they're about to cap it as

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:34.490 
just in case they're about to cap it as

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.290 
body the frag goes over the middle stage
area<00:02:37.560> and<00:02:37.890> it's<00:02:38.310> going<00:02:38.430> to<00:02:38.520> bounce<00:02:38.640> off<00:02:39.000> this

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:39.300
