fresh tomato here's a shopping tip when

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:26.800 
fresh tomato here's a shopping tip when
looking<00:02:25.099> for<00:02:25.280> catch-up<00:02:25.489> the<00:02:25.880> deeper<00:02:26.420> red

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810 
looking for catch-up the deeper red

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:28.870 
looking for catch-up the deeper red
color<00:02:27.140> tends<00:02:27.530> to<00:02:27.680> go<00:02:27.800> with<00:02:27.980> higher<00:02:28.250> lycopene

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:28.880 
color tends to go with higher lycopene

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:32.080 
color tends to go with higher lycopene
levels<00:02:29.560> so<00:02:30.560> this<00:02:30.890> simple<00:02:31.400> switch<00:02:31.670> could<00:02:31.970> make

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:32.090 
levels so this simple switch could make

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:34.089 
levels so this simple switch could make
a<00:02:32.120> big<00:02:32.450> difference<00:02:32.510> because<00:02:33.440> tomatoes<00:02:33.769> are

00:02:34.089 --> 00:02:34.099 
a big difference because tomatoes are
