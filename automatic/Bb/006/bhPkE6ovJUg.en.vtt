the same price point I think they're

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.250 
the same price point I think they're
crazy<00:00:20.880> but<00:00:21.270> I<00:00:21.330> actually<00:00:21.480> like<00:00:21.900> how<00:00:22.080> they

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
crazy but I actually like how they

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.259 
crazy but I actually like how they
differentiated<00:00:23.010> so<00:00:23.340> this<00:00:23.490> is<00:00:23.640> the<00:00:23.730> 14<00:00:24.119> it

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
differentiated so this is the 14 it

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:26.000 
differentiated so this is the 14 it

it's<00:01:42.329> Snell<00:01:42.570> they<00:01:42.750> left<00:01:42.960> it<00:01:43.140> out<00:01:43.320> again<00:01:43.710> you

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
it's Snell they left it out again you

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:45.830 
it's Snell they left it out again you
can<00:01:43.950> get<00:01:44.070> that<00:01:44.220> on<00:01:44.369> the<00:01:44.490> 1600<00:01:45.240> that<00:01:45.420> is<00:01:45.600> one<00:01:45.750> of

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
can get that on the 1600 that is one of

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.420 
can get that on the 1600 that is one of
the<00:01:45.899> differentiating<00:01:46.470> factors<00:01:46.829> but<00:01:47.100> I<00:01:47.159> will

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
the differentiating factors but I will

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.609 
the differentiating factors but I will
say<00:01:47.640> the<00:01:47.850> venting<00:01:48.299> scheme<00:01:48.630> we<00:01:49.020> like<00:01:49.229> a<00:01:49.380> lot

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
them on the front here that are gonna

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.530 
them on the front here that are gonna
flow<00:01:58.619> more<00:01:58.950> air<00:01:59.219> through<00:01:59.579> this<00:01:59.700> channel<00:02:00.030> more

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
flow more air through this channel more

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.450 
flow more air through this channel more
air<00:02:00.810> through<00:02:00.840> the<00:02:01.200> helmet<00:02:01.530> and<00:02:01.619> the<00:02:01.890> EPS<00:02:02.280> has

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
air through the helmet and the EPS has

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:03.889 
air through the helmet and the EPS has
some<00:02:02.640> grooves<00:02:02.909> in<00:02:03.060> it<00:02:03.119> it's<00:02:03.360> gonna<00:02:03.450> perform<00:02:03.659> a

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
some grooves in it it's gonna perform a

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:05.450 
some grooves in it it's gonna perform a
little<00:02:04.020> bit<00:02:04.140> better<00:02:04.200> than<00:02:04.530> its<00:02:04.680> 1600<00:02:05.250> which<00:02:05.340> is

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
little bit better than its 1600 which is

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:06.980 
little bit better than its 1600 which is
its<00:02:05.640> counterpart<00:02:06.090> so<00:02:06.329> again<00:02:06.570> there's<00:02:06.750> a<00:02:06.810> bit

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
its counterpart so again there's a bit

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.510 
its counterpart so again there's a bit
of<00:02:07.079> that<00:02:07.170> back<00:02:07.380> and<00:02:07.409> forth<00:02:07.829> there<00:02:08.039> but<00:02:08.369> that's

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
of that back and forth there but that's

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:09.800 
of that back and forth there but that's
one<00:02:08.700> of<00:02:08.789> the<00:02:08.849> things<00:02:09.030> that<00:02:09.149> we<00:02:09.239> really<00:02:09.509> like<00:02:09.690> we

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
one of the things that we really like we

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:10.699 
one of the things that we really like we
like<00:02:09.959> the<00:02:10.050> price<00:02:10.229> point<00:02:10.470> we<00:02:10.530> like<00:02:10.619> the

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
like the price point we like the

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:12.860 
like the price point we like the
protective<00:02:11.190> profile<00:02:11.970> first<00:02:12.270> time<00:02:12.420> Snell<00:02:12.690> from

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
protective profile first time Snell from

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:13.820 
protective profile first time Snell from
speed<00:02:13.110> and<00:02:13.200> strength<00:02:13.290> and<00:02:13.620> we

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
speed and strength and we

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.470 
speed and strength and we
the<00:02:13.980> airflow<00:02:14.280> through<00:02:14.550> the<00:02:14.640> helmet<00:02:14.940> I'm<00:02:15.060> also

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
the airflow through the helmet I'm also

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.450 
the airflow through the helmet I'm also
going<00:02:15.870> to<00:02:15.960> call<00:02:16.260> out<00:02:16.530> that<00:02:16.890> the<00:02:17.010> interior<00:02:17.430> is

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
cool core on this helmet the 1400 it's

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:20.900 
cool core on this helmet the 1400 it's
gonna<00:02:19.800> be<00:02:19.950> a<00:02:19.980> little<00:02:20.160> bit<00:02:20.340> more<00:02:20.460> plush<00:02:20.730> it's

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
gonna be a little bit more plush it's

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:22.280 
gonna be a little bit more plush it's
actually<00:02:21.150> one<00:02:21.240> of<00:02:21.300> the<00:02:21.390> most<00:02:21.480> plush<00:02:21.840> interiors

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
actually one of the most plush interiors

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:25.160 
actually one of the most plush interiors
we've<00:02:22.680> seen<00:02:23.010> from<00:02:23.430> speed<00:02:23.850> and<00:02:24.090> strength<00:02:24.780> which

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
we've seen from speed and strength which

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:27.320 
we've seen from speed and strength which
is<00:02:25.290> a<00:02:25.320> nice<00:02:25.650> touch<00:02:25.950> tying<00:02:26.370> it<00:02:26.520> all<00:02:26.730> together<00:02:26.940> in

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 
is a nice touch tying it all together in

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:29.090 
is a nice touch tying it all together in
their<00:02:27.480> line<00:02:27.660> again<00:02:28.050> around<00:02:28.290> the<00:02:28.350> $200<00:02:28.830> mark

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:29.100 
their line again around the $200 mark

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:30.320 
their line again around the $200 mark
now<00:02:29.490> we<00:02:29.550> look<00:02:29.820> at<00:02:29.940> some<00:02:30.090> of<00:02:30.150> the<00:02:30.210> other

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330 
now we look at some of the other

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:32.120 
now we look at some of the other
features<00:02:30.660> here<00:02:30.690> on<00:02:30.900> the<00:02:30.990> outside<00:02:31.590> on<00:02:31.980> the

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130 
features here on the outside on the

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:34.010 
features here on the outside on the
exterior<00:02:32.670> you're<00:02:33.150> gonna<00:02:33.240> see<00:02:33.450> a<00:02:33.480> chin<00:02:33.810> bent

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:34.020 
exterior you're gonna see a chin bent

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:35.840 
exterior you're gonna see a chin bent
down<00:02:34.290> here<00:02:34.560> along<00:02:34.740> the<00:02:34.890> front<00:02:34.950> you<00:02:35.550> notice

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:35.850 
down here along the front you notice

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:37.310

our knit picks it's a little low it's a

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:39.860 
our knit picks it's a little low it's a
little<00:02:38.880> hard<00:02:39.060> to<00:02:39.180> find<00:02:39.330> with<00:02:39.480> a<00:02:39.570> gloved<00:02:39.780> hand

little hard to find with a gloved hand

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:41.840 
little hard to find with a gloved hand
but<00:02:40.290> that's<00:02:40.380> okay<00:02:40.710> again<00:02:41.220> there's<00:02:41.460> a<00:02:41.550> bang<00:02:41.700> for

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:41.850 
but that's okay again there's a bang for

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:42.950 
but that's okay again there's a bang for
the<00:02:41.910> buck<00:02:41.940> factor<00:02:42.390> here<00:02:42.570> you<00:02:42.660> can't<00:02:42.900> get

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:42.960 
the buck factor here you can't get

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:45.380 
the buck factor here you can't get
everything<00:02:43.200> you<00:02:43.410> need<00:02:43.790> when<00:02:44.790> we<00:02:44.910> open<00:02:45.300> our

that<00:02:52.680> I<00:02:52.800> think<00:02:52.860> that<00:02:53.130> they<00:02:53.250> could<00:02:53.310> do<00:02:53.490> a<00:02:53.520> better

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
that I think that they could do a better

that I think that they could do a better
job<00:02:53.850> with<00:02:54.180> moving<00:02:54.480> forward<00:02:54.510> now<00:02:55.080> we<00:02:55.140> turn<00:02:55.380> the
