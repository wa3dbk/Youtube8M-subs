00:01:58.990 --> 00:01:59.000 
are owned by Fox but they might have

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.819 
are owned by Fox but they might have
like<00:01:59.180> a<00:01:59.210> veto<00:01:59.750> ability<00:02:00.290> to<00:02:00.409> say<00:02:00.560> wait<00:02:00.710> a<00:02:00.740> minute

00:02:00.819 --> 00:02:00.829 
like a veto ability to say wait a minute

00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:04.929 
like a veto ability to say wait a minute
you<00:02:01.460> cannot<00:02:02.090> have<00:02:02.540> Wolverine<00:02:03.380> in<00:02:03.890> a<00:02:04.549> movie

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:04.939 
you cannot have Wolverine in a movie

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:06.819 
you cannot have Wolverine in a movie
with<00:02:05.030> Batman<00:02:05.600> like<00:02:06.079> they<00:02:06.290> might<00:02:06.530> but<00:02:06.680> they

00:02:06.819 --> 00:02:06.829 
with Batman like they might but they

00:02:06.829 --> 00:02:08.440 
with Batman like they might but they
might<00:02:07.040> not<00:02:07.250> have<00:02:07.310> that<00:02:07.790> creative<00:02:08.149> control

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:08.450 
might not have that creative control

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:10.600 
might not have that creative control
they<00:02:08.720> may<00:02:08.840> not<00:02:08.989> have<00:02:09.050> that<00:02:09.470> veto<00:02:09.649> ability<00:02:10.099> so

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:10.610 
they may not have that veto ability so

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:13.300 
they may not have that veto ability so

you see how this is gonna involve Dennis

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:16.449 
you see how this is gonna involve Dennis
when<00:02:14.930> you<00:02:15.020> heard<00:02:15.230> about<00:02:15.410> this<00:02:15.680> like<00:02:15.890> how<00:02:16.010> what

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:17.090 
do you think of some of the

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:18.370 
do you think of some of the
possibilities<00:02:17.750> and<00:02:17.900> what<00:02:18.020> do<00:02:18.080> you<00:02:18.170> think<00:02:18.290> is

possibilities and what do you think is

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:20.260

actually<00:02:18.470> gonna<00:02:18.739> happen<00:02:19.010> here<00:02:19.130> well<00:02:19.819> I'm

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:20.270 
actually gonna happen here well I'm

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:24.120 
actually gonna happen here well I'm
actually<00:02:20.840> hoping<00:02:21.560> that<00:02:21.950> they<00:02:22.160> don't<00:02:22.430> merge<00:02:22.819> I

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:24.130 
actually hoping that they don't merge I

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:27.370 
actually hoping that they don't merge I
think<00:02:25.130> Fox<00:02:25.540> does<00:02:26.540> certain<00:02:26.870> things<00:02:27.080> well<00:02:27.349> and

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:27.380 
think Fox does certain things well and

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:28.930 
think Fox does certain things well and
they<00:02:27.770> have<00:02:27.920> some<00:02:28.099> weaknesses<00:02:28.610> and<00:02:28.760> staying

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:28.940 
they have some weaknesses and staying

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:30.370 
they have some weaknesses and staying
with<00:02:29.060> one<00:02:29.270> of<00:02:29.360> ours<00:02:29.480> and<00:02:29.599> they<00:02:29.690> have<00:02:29.810> totally

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:30.380 
with one of ours and they have totally

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:31.839 
with one of ours and they have totally
different<00:02:30.410> fields<00:02:31.069> this<00:02:31.160> company<00:02:31.610> and<00:02:31.730> the

00:02:31.839 --> 00:02:31.849 
different fields this company and the

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:33.280 
different fields this company and the
type<00:02:32.030> of<00:02:32.060> entertainment<00:02:32.599> they<00:02:32.840> put<00:02:33.080> out<00:02:33.200> and

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.290 
type of entertainment they put out and

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:35.080 
type of entertainment they put out and
they<00:02:33.349> both<00:02:33.530> put<00:02:34.069> out<00:02:34.190> good<00:02:34.370> stuff<00:02:34.610> but<00:02:34.819> just<00:02:34.849> in

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.090 
they both put out good stuff but just in

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:37.150 
they both put out good stuff but just in
different<00:02:35.269> ways<00:02:35.599> and<00:02:35.870> so<00:02:35.989> I<00:02:36.019> think<00:02:36.200> if<00:02:36.890> they<00:02:37.099> do

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:37.160 
different ways and so I think if they do

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:40.089 
different ways and so I think if they do
merge<00:02:37.640> I<00:02:37.880> I'm<00:02:38.480> kind<00:02:38.840> of<00:02:38.989> worried<00:02:39.410> actually<00:02:39.890> I

00:02:40.089 --> 00:02:40.099 
merge I I'm kind of worried actually I

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:41.949 
merge I I'm kind of worried actually I
mean<00:02:40.280> in<00:02:40.670> the<00:02:41.060> short<00:02:41.300> term<00:02:41.480> having<00:02:41.690> something

00:02:41.949 --> 00:02:41.959 
mean in the short term having something

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:43.509 
mean in the short term having something
cool<00:02:42.200> like<00:02:42.230> a<00:02:42.410> Justice<00:02:42.860> League<00:02:43.069> x-men

00:02:43.509 --> 00:02:43.519 
cool like a Justice League x-men

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:45.070 
cool like a Justice League x-men
crossover<00:02:44.060> that<00:02:44.209> might<00:02:44.420> be<00:02:44.569> really<00:02:44.810> cool<00:02:45.019> and

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:45.080 
crossover that might be really cool and

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:49.180 
crossover that might be really cool and
fun<00:02:45.590> on<00:02:45.860> paper<00:02:46.220> on<00:02:46.489> paper<00:02:46.840> but<00:02:48.069> ultimately<00:02:49.069> I

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:49.190 
fun on paper on paper but ultimately I

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:50.830 
fun on paper on paper but ultimately I
don't<00:02:49.489> know<00:02:49.670> I<00:02:49.700> think<00:02:49.910> it'd<00:02:50.150> be<00:02:50.180> a<00:02:50.299> big<00:02:50.600> mess

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:50.840 
don't know I think it'd be a big mess

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:53.020 
don't know I think it'd be a big mess
honestly<00:02:51.380> yeah<00:02:52.040> I<00:02:52.069> agree<00:02:52.580> it<00:02:52.640> would<00:02:52.819> just

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:53.030 
honestly yeah I agree it would just

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:55.270 
honestly yeah I agree it would just
