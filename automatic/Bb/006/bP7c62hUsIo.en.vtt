00:04:18.259 --> 00:04:20.360 
between sleight of hand and marathon
startup<00:04:19.259> and<00:04:19.380> Pro<00:04:19.560> is<00:04:19.709> essentially<00:04:20.220> useless

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:20.370 
startup and Pro is essentially useless

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:22.879 
startup and Pro is essentially useless
but<00:04:21.329> the<00:04:21.419> faster<00:04:21.720> reload<00:04:22.049> can<00:04:22.289> be<00:04:22.410> useful

00:04:22.879 --> 00:04:22.889 
but the faster reload can be useful

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:24.950 
but the faster reload can be useful
I'd<00:04:23.820> recommend<00:04:24.120> sleight<00:04:24.419> of<00:04:24.449> hand<00:04:24.720> if<00:04:24.840> you're

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:24.960 
I'd recommend sleight of hand if you're

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:28.820 
I'd recommend sleight of hand if you're
using<00:04:25.169> the<00:04:25.350> m1014<00:04:25.680> as<00:04:26.220> a<00:04:26.340> backup<00:04:27.650> if<00:04:28.650> you're

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:28.830 
using the m1014 as a backup if you're

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:30.350 
using the m1014 as a backup if you're
using<00:04:29.039> it<00:04:29.250> as<00:04:29.370> more<00:04:29.610> of<00:04:29.669> a<00:04:29.759> primary<00:04:30.210> weapon

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:30.360

however<00:04:30.830> marathon<00:04:31.830> is<00:04:32.039> probably<00:04:32.430> the<00:04:32.520> better
