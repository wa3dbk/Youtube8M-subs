 bacon is not recommended for a diet 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:27.860
 It is generally known to all but 

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:30.980
 you knew you had to drink every day 

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:34.079

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:36.030
 the same goes for some types of coffee 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:37.800
 we must be careful what 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.379
 we drink when we are in the process of 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:43.019
 weight loss since we do not give ourselves 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:45.659
 account and taking a couple of healthy juices and 

00:00:43.019 --> 00:00:47.339
 a coffee we can get to ingest the 

00:00:45.659 --> 00:00:49.440
 same number of calories as a meal 

00:00:47.339 --> 00:00:51.299
 so clear 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.879
 then we will talk about some 

00:00:51.299 --> 00:00:56.549
 How many tips regarding drinks that 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:01:00.089
 We usually take it daily to avoid 

00:00:56.549 --> 00:01:02.969
 Ingest those other calories on purpose 

00:01:00.089 --> 00:01:06.390
 if you do not want to be wrong about 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:09.780
 drinks drink water or infusions of 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:13.049
 fruits and herbs and sweetened with stevia 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:16.290
 or saccharin never with sugar or any 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:19.530
 another sweetener with a lot 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:21.660
 the juice is very healthy and has many 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.240
 properties but it's not a drink 

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:27.150
 advisable to take when you want 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:30.570
 quench thirst a glass of 200 milliliters 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:34.110
 of fruit juice has between 90 and 100 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:36.990
 calories try to reduce the amount of 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.820
 juice with your life or dilute it in water and 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.970
 consume them always without sugars 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:44.190
 added this is very important but 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:46.620
 better still do it in the juices 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:48.960
 natural as we put in 

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:51.090
 our channel another very option 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.550
 interesting is to consume juices of 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:56.660
 vegetables since they contain half of 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:56.660
 calories than those of fruits 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:05.710
 cappuccino latte macchiato or chinese maca 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:08.230
 Beware of some types of coffee a 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:11.770
 latte macchiato glass of 300 

00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:14.470
 milliliters reaches 180 calories and 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:17.020
 similar thing happens with the Chinese mocha and a 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:20.950
 200 milliliter cappuccino reaches 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:24.460
 50 calories the smartest thing would be 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:28.140
 take your coffee alone free practically 

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:28.140
 of calories if you throw Karim
