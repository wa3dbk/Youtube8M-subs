 hello to all the friends 16 take 

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:18.700
 that they find today for a 

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:20.350
 new video on a fashion so kate 

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:22.390
 to quests of cagnes to remember more 

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:23.950
 late May 30 at the club made on the infinite 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:25.660
 this mode we have it directly to little 

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:26.700
 got the contract for the right talked to 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:29.560
 two pnj on the map 

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:32.800
 so the teacher me globe is the new 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:35.110
 companion of the 2.18 shire make a 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:38.140
 video soon on these different and 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:39.850
 fachos who is pretty friendly so 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:43.660
 for probably what I am in 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:45.719
 train there wheat blix drum 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:48.969
 you do not touch his name 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:50.829
 we must have done all the 

00:00:48.969 --> 00:00:52.120
 issues from kate before themes you 

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:54.969
 will not have more or less for four hours 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:56.739
 I think even a greater gift 

00:00:54.969 --> 00:00:59.460
 as canicula dungeons of offers when 

00:00:56.739 --> 00:01:01.300
 even long enough to get here 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.530
 now I do not think it's too much 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:05.910
 duos and more level cadres or 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:08.320
 less than 160 170 not against the blair 

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:12.490
 hurt on the mount I never know ashore 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:14.860
 his name bikes and mooch not the cannas 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:15.659
 session i'm going to tell you these 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:17.980
 different business 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:21.640
 so you have to know that you can 

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:24.460
 not kill him in a vulnerable state and 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:26.200
 only Gala Gala I think who 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:29.650
 is called the knight people 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:31.690
 him off then already rocking 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:32.920
 yes he has 2 pm and then vast and 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:34.930
 report who win they made us 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:36.190
 win a third then he will not do 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:37.420
 in a straight line through the walls and a 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:38.970
 diagonal through the walls has a 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:41.170
 range of 5 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:43.870
 it's not very important for example 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:44.620
 300 by then with 50% of erosion it is necessary 

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:47.350
 do a little more attention 

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:49.840
 and yet another spell at 2 theo around 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:51.720
 of him of tea in any case yes in 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:55.120
 diagonally and online when I believe 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:56.950
 that they strike at neutral striking luxor 

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:58.420
 and but also a poison when 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:01.770
 way comes out in a straight line or in 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:03.520
 diagonal with 50% of relations 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.440
 now it's not really that the 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:07.870
 full principal is that he can 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:10.269
 attract from and united from the 

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:12.700
 second turn one passes he can activate 

00:02:10.269 --> 00:02:14.170
 the characters of the first towers is there 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:15.430
 from the second round he has to 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:18.730
 power or one shot in hand-to-hand 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:20.620
 save galaade so precisely the 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:22.510
 knight against him he must do 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:24.010
 a little more attention he has that 2300 for 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:25.500
 him and he's actually going 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:28.170
 allow to remove the maple tables 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:32.190
 blame the excess I believe this loan as 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:33.960
 so that's actually it just needs to be 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:37.350
 again accord to turn 5 

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:38.580
 and after all the turns a father so 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:39.990
 ie around it's around 8 and 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:42.150
 serves to it's going to take him off is 

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:44.160
 invulnerable for a ride so by 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:45.180
 example here is going to take away the flaws 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:47.430
 vulnerable like that we can hit 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:50.730
 turn 6 so you 'll be able to each 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:55.500
 times caught self that open 6 8 10 12 and 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:58.170
 now the problem is that 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:00.350
 black semou translated and printing 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:04.230
 steadily and damages 2,900 

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:05.790
 so we are that can china so I 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:08.100
 would say if you do not have iob with 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:10.470
 rukoko for example to tread rather the 

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:13.650
 play erosion handing erosion 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:14.940
 hitting in the rounds loses so there 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:16.680
 precisely the horde placed a coconut 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:19.500
 leaps they are not very well played there 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:23.510
 before and fabien moustrou cox and with the 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:25.170
 cold in the cabin of 5000 da lage 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:26.550
 so then you have to be careful 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:28.350
 not to stay with him who have nothing 

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:29.730
 again one-shot and put back well 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:31.019
 the knight every time so the 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:33.780
 technique we use it is that we put 

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:37.830
 the mob in a corner as could law 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:39.120
 is it is blocked by by royal gall 

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:43.470
 a lot of corners in the map 1 there is some 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:46.760
 1 2 3 4 5 and 6 6 corner we can beat him 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:49.160
 two so our cloud a little bit the bar 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:51.090
 and as maintenance and others and makes 

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:52.350
 so you may have noticed at 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:53.459
 every time for the carpet there is a 200 

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:55.560
 deep resistance in moments 

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:56.329
 where we hit and 10% weakness in 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:58.769
 other elements 

00:03:56.329 --> 00:04:01.709
 so that means if we type for example 

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:03.450
 we will win 200% at and lose 10% 

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:05.579
 of resistance in all the others 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:06.780
 elements and all for 2 towers val us 

00:04:05.579 --> 00:04:09.450
 around the person is hitting her and 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:11.820
 start again sophie for example magnificent 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:12.390
 strikes around sets at turn 9 at the beginning of 

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:15.810
 turn 9 

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:17.820
 he will recover these resistances so that 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:19.859
 it can be very useful for precisely 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:21.930
 well placed a coconut we take for example 

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:23.130
 all with Christian bagadoÃ¹ and 

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:28.350
 hamburg he comes so that does not make him 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:29.850
 sore eyes and here they are against this 

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:32.040
 that you have to be careful is that there's 

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:34.680
 the other aed with so volumes him 

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:35.010
 but 50% erosion with, among others, 

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:36.840
 poisons 

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:38.350
 so that can be many times that the 

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:39.940
 debug to avoid poisons 

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:41.850
 the sacrificed they could put a 

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:44.260
 evasion at sight etc 

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:46.570
 it's actually the knight is 

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:49.210
 invulnerable during the rounds during 

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:50.920
 which finally the knight becomes 

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:53.230
 vulnerable tower where he will render 

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:54.940
 vulnerable the mob ie around up 

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:57.430
 the end of the turn that will make a big 

00:04:54.940 --> 00:05:00.240
 we go out that makes him vulnerable the mob 

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:02.380
 enemies there Berberism August 

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:04.930
 but he himself will be vulnerable 

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:06.240
 during turn 6 so that is to say at 

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:08.500
 start of tour66 will receive damage 

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:09.880
 years acropolis sacrifice or put him some 

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:12.070
 resistances to prevent them from killing 

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:16.030
 would still mostly because of 

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:17.410
 erosion it goes down pretty quickly we I 

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:19.300
 really advise you to play either 

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:20.980
 erosion either with cocos so of 

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:23.830
 preference with a nokia is when 

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:25.780
 even simpler also know that the 

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:28.390
 knight toul and where he will take away 

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:30.850
 5% tavita max even if they had not served 

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:33.100
 at max current so at first it's I 

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:36.360
 18000 points 19 for the 950 points said 

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:38.680
 is true it decreases a little so 907 etc. 

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:41.470
 so that's why anyway his 

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:43.260
 vita will diminish in you with the 

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:45.550
 knight not much since it holds 

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:47.320
 precisely on the contrary exponentially this 

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:49.830
 amazing silhouettes of heavyweights 

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:49.830
 is negative 

00:05:54.870 --> 00:06:02.289
 short so if you have to do that is the 

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:03.430
 always strike with other elements 

00:06:02.289 --> 00:06:06.550
 so to pick up some characters that are 

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:08.020
 not necessarily term like that or well 

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:10.630
 especially for example take three 

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:12.550
 characters that will fire is a person who 

00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:14.340
 hit them multi elements so that's it 

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:16.180
 is the other four elements like that 

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:18.370
 he'll be able to hit four times in 

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:19.539
 the trick is it's true that here we 

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:21.400
 strikes that earth can also 

00:06:19.539 --> 00:06:23.110
 hit our a little bit it's not very 

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:25.000
 so many years that refutes 

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:27.669
 still the damage of 900 I do not know 

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:31.090
 not so if it's constant it's a way 

00:06:27.669 --> 00:06:32.729
 to remove this harm reduction bug from 

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:35.199
 ruin I did not find 

00:06:32.729 --> 00:06:36.430
 we can also summoned 20 of opel 

00:06:35.199 --> 00:06:37.090
 for example sacred it is useful for 

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:40.150
 masters of vulnerabilities 

00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:42.370
 extra so then down the 

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:43.389
 fight is going on like that here we go the 

00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:47.289
 kill at the next coconut that is 

00:06:43.389 --> 00:06:49.000
 by the way the 12 around with them thank you 

00:06:47.289 --> 00:06:52.449
 in the kingdom besides not so that's 

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:55.330
 thanks to marie sy for for helping me 

00:06:52.449 --> 00:06:57.220
 for this fight is bitter so she will have 

00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:58.630
 my cosmo globe after a lot of teeth 

00:06:57.220 --> 00:07:01.389
 of kate I hold it screams and on the 

00:06:58.630 --> 00:07:05.139
 nests make it look really pale 2% 

00:07:01.389 --> 00:07:08.199
 over 50% of them resist weaknesses 

00:07:05.139 --> 00:07:10.360
 takes the game pushes well but perso and 

00:07:08.199 --> 00:07:11.440
 magneto goal is really I you 

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:12.520
 advise to sell elsewhere for you 

00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:14.440
 for this piece of furniture 

00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:16.719
 it's a bit what they prefer 

00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:19.539
 perhaps also a fact that for 

00:07:16.719 --> 00:07:20.979
 reduce a little galade here I hope 

00:07:19.539 --> 00:07:25.169
 that you liked in his boat for a 

00:07:20.979 --> 00:07:25.169
 next video it was sm caen
