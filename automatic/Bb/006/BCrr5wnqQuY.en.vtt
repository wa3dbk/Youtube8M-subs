BFA in drawing and painting and today
I'll<00:00:07.500> be<00:00:07.560> showing<00:00:07.770> you<00:00:08.069> how<00:00:08.340> to<00:00:08.370> draw<00:00:08.670> solids

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.120 
I'll be showing you how to draw solids

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.810 
I'll be showing you how to draw solids
today<00:00:09.690> will<00:00:09.870> be<00:00:09.990> the<00:00:10.170> cone<00:00:10.580> I'll<00:00:11.580> be<00:00:11.700> using

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820 
today will be the cone I'll be using

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.790 
today will be the cone I'll be using
soft<00:00:12.240> compressed<00:00:12.809> charcoal<00:00:15.199> and<00:00:16.199> any<00:00:16.470> marks

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
soft compressed charcoal and any marks

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.140 
soft compressed charcoal and any marks
that<00:00:16.890> you're<00:00:17.010> unhappy<00:00:17.130> with<00:00:17.460> can<00:00:17.789> be<00:00:17.820> erased

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
that you're unhappy with can be erased

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.179 
that you're unhappy with can be erased
simply<00:00:18.630> using<00:00:18.900> a<00:00:18.990> kneaded<00:00:19.260> eraser<00:00:19.650> which<00:00:20.070> is

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
simply using a kneaded eraser which is

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.340 
simply using a kneaded eraser which is
the<00:00:20.310> best<00:00:20.520> eraser<00:00:20.910> to<00:00:21.029> use<00:00:21.240> for<00:00:22.020> compressed

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
the best eraser to use for compressed

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.089 
the best eraser to use for compressed
charcoal<00:00:22.710> a<00:00:24.080> cone<00:00:25.080> can<00:00:25.289> be<00:00:25.410> set<00:00:25.650> in<00:00:25.800> many

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
charcoal a cone can be set in many

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:27.920 
charcoal a cone can be set in many
different<00:00:26.310> orientations<00:00:27.090> in<00:00:27.240> space<00:00:27.510> since<00:00:27.779> it

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
different orientations in space since it

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.620 
different orientations in space since it
is<00:00:28.050> a<00:00:28.080> three<00:00:28.349> dimensional<00:00:28.769> object<00:00:29.090> so<00:00:30.090> I'm

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
is a three dimensional object so I'm

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.240 
is a three dimensional object so I'm
going<00:00:30.960> to<00:00:31.019> focus<00:00:31.380> today<00:00:31.500> on<00:00:31.619> most<00:00:31.859> impossible

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
going to focus today on most impossible

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:33.830 
going to focus today on most impossible
which<00:00:32.669> is<00:00:32.820> straight<00:00:33.059> upside<00:00:33.390> down<00:00:33.540> with<00:00:33.809> the

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
which is straight upside down with the

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.630 
which is straight upside down with the
point<00:00:34.230> on<00:00:34.410> the<00:00:34.829> ground<00:00:37.340> so<00:00:38.340> we're<00:00:38.489> going<00:00:38.579> to

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
point on the ground so we're going to

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.819 
point on the ground so we're going to
start<00:00:38.910> from<00:00:39.570> the<00:00:39.690> apex<00:00:40.020> of<00:00:40.200> the<00:00:40.260> cone<00:00:40.530> which<00:00:40.770> is

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
start from the apex of the cone which is

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:48.260 
start from the apex of the cone which is
its<00:00:41.010> point<00:00:41.899> and<00:00:42.899> go<00:00:43.050> out<00:00:46.640> now<00:00:47.640> the<00:00:47.700> base<00:00:47.969> of<00:00:48.180> the

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
its point and go out now the base of the

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.330 
its point and go out now the base of the
cone<00:00:48.450> is<00:00:48.480> this<00:00:48.750> angle<00:00:49.110> will<00:00:49.440> not<00:00:49.590> be<00:00:49.800> a<00:00:49.829> circle

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
cone is this angle will not be a circle

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.010 
cone is this angle will not be a circle
as<00:00:50.579> it<00:00:50.730> is<00:00:50.820> in<00:00:50.969> real<00:00:51.090> life<00:00:51.270> if<00:00:51.449> you<00:00:51.539> look<00:00:51.690> at<00:00:51.870> it

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
as it is in real life if you look at it

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.930 
as it is in real life if you look at it
head-on<00:00:52.199> from<00:00:52.620> the<00:00:52.710> top<00:00:52.890> from<00:00:53.730> the<00:00:53.850> bottom

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
head-on from the top from the bottom

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:59.779 
head-on from the top from the bottom
really<00:00:54.239> but<00:00:54.690> it<00:00:54.780> will<00:00:54.930> be<00:00:55.050> an<00:00:55.289> ellipse<00:00:58.789> drawn

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
really but it will be an ellipse drawn

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:04.090 
really but it will be an ellipse drawn
something<00:01:00.059> like<00:01:00.270> a<00:01:00.300> very<00:01:00.660> narrow<00:01:00.989> football

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:04.100 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:06.350 

now<00:01:05.100> this<00:01:05.369> cone<00:01:05.549> is<00:01:05.580> still<00:01:05.909> looking<00:01:06.180> a<00:01:06.240> little

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
now this cone is still looking a little

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:07.820 
now this cone is still looking a little
two-dimensional<00:01:07.110> it<00:01:07.200> could<00:01:07.320> be<00:01:07.439> something

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
two-dimensional it could be something

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.469 
two-dimensional it could be something
that<00:01:07.860> was<00:01:08.159> stepped<00:01:08.700> on<00:01:08.820> it<00:01:09.000> could<00:01:09.119> be<00:01:09.180> a<00:01:09.210> flat

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
that was stepped on it could be a flat

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.539 
that was stepped on it could be a flat
cone<00:01:09.720> so<00:01:10.710> we're<00:01:10.830> going<00:01:10.950> to<00:01:11.010> add<00:01:11.130> a<00:01:11.159> little<00:01:11.369> bit

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
cone so we're going to add a little bit

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.160 
cone so we're going to add a little bit
of<00:01:11.580> shading<00:01:11.850> and<00:01:12.180> I'm<00:01:12.570> going<00:01:12.689> to<00:01:12.750> do<00:01:12.900> that<00:01:13.020> in

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
of shading and I'm going to do that in

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.380 
of shading and I'm going to do that in
the<00:01:13.260> simplest<00:01:13.710> method<00:01:14.010> possible<00:01:14.520> which<00:01:15.119> is<00:01:15.270> to

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
the simplest method possible which is to

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.570 
the simplest method possible which is to
use<00:01:15.420> the<00:01:15.630> side<00:01:15.869> of<00:01:16.140> your<00:01:16.259> utensil<00:01:16.770> if<00:01:17.430> you're

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
use the side of your utensil if you're

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.700 
use the side of your utensil if you're
using<00:01:17.700> compressed<00:01:18.150> charcoal<00:01:18.560> will<00:01:19.560> give<00:01:19.680> a

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
using compressed charcoal will give a

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.870 
using compressed charcoal will give a
very<00:01:19.799> smooth<00:01:20.250> even<00:01:20.700> tone<00:01:22.430> you<00:01:23.430> can<00:01:23.460> go<00:01:23.729> over

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
very smooth even tone you can go over

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.149 
very smooth even tone you can go over
that<00:01:23.939> as<00:01:24.119> many<00:01:24.299> times<00:01:24.509> you<00:01:24.630> need<00:01:24.900> to<00:01:25.140> get<00:01:26.070> the

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
that as many times you need to get the

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:32.319 
that as many times you need to get the
right<00:01:26.340> kind<00:01:26.549> of<00:01:26.790> shadow

00:01:32.319 --> 00:01:32.329 

00:01:32.329 --> 00:01:34.670 

I'm<00:01:33.329> pretty<00:01:33.570> happy<00:01:33.869> with<00:01:33.930> that<00:01:33.990> for<00:01:34.380> the<00:01:34.439> sides

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
I'm pretty happy with that for the sides

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.969 
I'm pretty happy with that for the sides
of<00:01:34.860> the<00:01:34.950> cone<00:01:35.659> the<00:01:36.659> lips<00:01:37.079> the<00:01:37.290> top<00:01:37.470> will<00:01:37.680> also

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
of the cone the lips the top will also

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:39.440 
of the cone the lips the top will also
not<00:01:38.130> be<00:01:38.159> perfectly<00:01:38.759> lit<00:01:38.970> it<00:01:39.149> will<00:01:39.270> have<00:01:39.390> a

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
not be perfectly lit it will have a

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:48.590 
not be perfectly lit it will have a
little<00:01:39.659> bit<00:01:39.780> of<00:01:39.869> shadow<00:01:40.110> as<00:01:40.380> well<00:01:46.009> and<00:01:47.539> it<00:01:48.539> will

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
little bit of shadow as well and it will

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.719 
little bit of shadow as well and it will
generally<00:01:49.080> be<00:01:49.259> the<00:01:49.500> shadow<00:01:49.860> that<00:01:50.070> is<00:01:50.130> on<00:01:50.429> the

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
generally be the shadow that is on the

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:53.660 
generally be the shadow that is on the
side<00:01:50.990> opposite<00:01:51.990> the<00:01:52.229> shadow<00:01:52.920> on<00:01:53.159> the<00:01:53.280> sides<00:01:53.490> of

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
side opposite the shadow on the sides of

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.819 
side opposite the shadow on the sides of
the<00:01:53.759> cone<00:01:53.939> and<00:01:54.210> that's<00:01:54.899> because<00:01:55.289> of<00:01:55.530> light

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
the cone and that's because of light

00:01:55.829 --> 00:02:00.740 
the cone and that's because of light
diffusion<00:01:58.220> so<00:01:59.220> we<00:01:59.310> show<00:01:59.520> that<00:01:59.729> and<00:02:00.479> you<00:02:00.600> can

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
diffusion so we show that and you can

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.529 
diffusion so we show that and you can
get<00:02:00.899> to<00:02:01.049> begin<00:02:01.789> kind<00:02:02.789> of<00:02:02.850> to<00:02:02.939> see<00:02:03.090> a<00:02:03.119> sense<00:02:03.390> of

00:02:03.529 --> 00:02:03.539 
get to begin kind of to see a sense of

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:06.800 
get to begin kind of to see a sense of
space<00:02:03.869> in<00:02:04.110> the<00:02:04.200> cone<00:02:04.380> now<00:02:05.190> the<00:02:05.250> last<00:02:05.520> thing<00:02:05.810> not

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
space in the cone now the last thing not

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.120 
space in the cone now the last thing not
really<00:02:07.080> letting<00:02:07.259> you<00:02:07.380> understand<00:02:07.830> where<00:02:08.009> it

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:08.130 
really letting you understand where it

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:10.490 
really letting you understand where it
sits<00:02:08.310> in<00:02:08.489> space<00:02:08.759> is<00:02:09.149> that<00:02:09.600> this<00:02:09.750> object<00:02:09.959> has<00:02:10.229> no

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
sits in space is that this object has no

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.650 
sits in space is that this object has no
shadow<00:02:10.880> if<00:02:11.880> they<00:02:12.000> were<00:02:12.060> actually<00:02:12.420> light

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
shadow if they were actually light

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:16.190 
shadow if they were actually light
hitting<00:02:12.900> it<00:02:13.110> from<00:02:13.470> this<00:02:13.709> side<00:02:14.810> it<00:02:15.810> would<00:02:15.959> throw

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
hitting it from this side it would throw

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:17.870 
hitting it from this side it would throw
it<00:02:16.319> shadow<00:02:16.620> into<00:02:17.010> the<00:02:17.099> room<00:02:17.310> on<00:02:17.519> whatever

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:17.880 
it shadow into the room on whatever

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:20.870 
it shadow into the room on whatever
surface<00:02:18.239> it's<00:02:18.599> on<00:02:18.799> so<00:02:19.799> maybe<00:02:20.040> this<00:02:20.489> is<00:02:20.700> the

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 
surface it's on so maybe this is the

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:27.470 
surface it's on so maybe this is the
edge<00:02:21.000> of<00:02:21.090> our<00:02:21.209> table<00:02:25.610> the<00:02:26.610> shadow<00:02:26.849> itself<00:02:27.299> will

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
edge of our table the shadow itself will

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:36.229 
edge of our table the shadow itself will
go<00:02:27.599> right<00:02:27.930> to<00:02:28.140> the<00:02:28.230> edge<00:02:28.380> of<00:02:28.650> that<00:02:28.739> table<00:02:35.239> it

00:02:36.229 --> 00:02:36.239 
go right to the edge of that table it

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:37.849 
go right to the edge of that table it
won't<00:02:36.420> just<00:02:36.600> stop<00:02:36.930> at<00:02:37.200> that<00:02:37.320> table<00:02:37.709> though

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:37.859 
won't just stop at that table though

00:02:37.859 --> 00:02:50.760 
won't just stop at that table though
it'll<00:02:38.820> be<00:02:38.940> thrown<00:02:39.180> onto<00:02:39.359> the<00:02:39.480> wall<00:02:39.690> behind<00:02:39.870> it

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:50.770 

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:52.710 

the<00:02:51.430> further<00:02:51.730> away<00:02:51.910> a<00:02:52.060> shadow<00:02:52.390> from<00:02:52.630> the

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:52.720 
the further away a shadow from the

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:57.540 
the further away a shadow from the
object<00:02:53.110> the<00:02:54.040> lighter<00:02:54.280> the<00:02:54.460> shadow<00:02:54.700> and<00:02:56.550> again

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:57.550 
object the lighter the shadow and again

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:58.950 
object the lighter the shadow and again
that's<00:02:57.730> because<00:02:57.940> of<00:02:58.210> the<00:02:58.330> way<00:02:58.420> light<00:02:58.690> works

00:02:58.950 --> 00:02:58.960 
that's because of the way light works

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:01.710 
that's because of the way light works
the<00:02:59.920> further<00:03:00.220> away<00:03:00.400> the<00:03:00.910> more<00:03:01.090> influence<00:03:01.540> of

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:01.720 
the further away the more influence of

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:05.790 
the further away the more influence of
other<00:03:01.900> sources<00:03:02.290> of<00:03:02.500> light<00:03:03.600> very<00:03:04.600> close<00:03:04.930> the

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:05.800 
other sources of light very close the

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:07.140 
other sources of light very close the
only<00:03:06.100> light<00:03:06.280> that's<00:03:06.490> really<00:03:06.670> affecting<00:03:07.030> that

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:07.150 
only light that's really affecting that

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:08.850 
only light that's really affecting that
shadow<00:03:07.420> is<00:03:07.690> the<00:03:07.870> direct<00:03:08.230> light<00:03:08.440> hitting<00:03:08.650> that

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:08.860 
shadow is the direct light hitting that

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:16.550 
shadow is the direct light hitting that
cone<00:03:09.070> so<00:03:09.910> that's<00:03:10.090> your<00:03:10.210> darkest<00:03:10.630> shadow<00:03:15.210> and

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
cone so that's your darkest shadow and

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:20.610 
cone so that's your darkest shadow and
there's<00:03:17.560> your<00:03:17.710> cone<00:03:19.620> three-dimensional

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:20.620 
there's your cone three-dimensional

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:24.830 
there's your cone three-dimensional
solid<00:03:20.770> in<00:03:21.070> space

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:24.840 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:26.900
