00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
straight and guess what I don't think

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.510 
straight and guess what I don't think
that's<00:00:38.910> true<00:00:39.350> the<00:00:40.350> reason<00:00:40.590> we<00:00:40.860> often<00:00:41.100> think

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
straight sometimes it comes from

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.139 
straight sometimes it comes from
marching<00:00:45.450> band<00:00:45.750> because<00:00:46.590> honestly<00:00:47.550> it<00:00:47.850> looks

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
marching band because honestly it looks

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.150 
marching band because honestly it looks
a<00:00:48.300> lot<00:00:48.450> better<00:00:48.510> to<00:00:49.289> have<00:00:49.440> a<00:00:49.469> whole<00:00:49.770> row<00:00:50.129> of

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
a lot better to have a whole row of

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.580 
a lot better to have a whole row of
flutist<00:00:51.030> with<00:00:51.570> everyone<00:00:52.050> with<00:00:52.170> their<00:00:52.289> flutes

straight so if your marching band
director<00:00:55.440> tells<00:00:55.800> you<00:00:55.980> that<00:00:56.129> you<00:00:56.250> need<00:00:56.430> to<00:00:56.550> keep

what<00:02:55.260> I<00:02:55.290> need<00:02:55.590> to<00:02:55.709> do<00:02:55.890> is<00:02:56.190> if<00:02:56.370> my<00:02:56.519> head<00:02:56.730> tilts<00:02:57.150> I

00:02:57.349 --> 00:02:57.359 
what I need to do is if my head tilts I

00:02:57.359 --> 00:03:01.300 
what I need to do is if my head tilts I
need<00:02:58.230> to<00:02:58.349> make<00:02:58.500> sure<00:02:58.530> that<00:02:58.829> the<00:02:58.950> flute<00:02:59.959> stays

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:01.310 
need to make sure that the flute stays

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:05.119 
need to make sure that the flute stays
aligned<00:03:02.310> here<00:03:02.930> which<00:03:03.930> actually<00:03:04.349> means<00:03:04.530> it's

00:03:05.119 --> 00:03:05.129 
aligned here which actually means it's

00:03:05.129 --> 00:03:07.009 
aligned here which actually means it's
going<00:03:05.340> to<00:03:05.489> drop<00:03:05.790> down<00:03:06.150> a<00:03:06.209> little<00:03:06.690> bit<00:03:06.840> because

00:03:07.009 --> 00:03:07.019 
going to drop down a little bit because

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:11.860 
going to drop down a little bit because
I<00:03:07.200> tilt<00:03:07.440> my<00:03:07.500> head<00:03:07.790> toward<00:03:08.790> my<00:03:08.940> right<00:03:09.150> shoulder

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:11.870 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:20.659 

that<00:03:17.599> already<00:03:18.599> sounds<00:03:18.930> a<00:03:18.989> lot<00:03:19.109> better<00:03:19.349> so<00:03:20.160> you

00:03:20.659 --> 00:03:20.669 
that already sounds a lot better so you

00:03:20.669 --> 00:03:22.520 
that already sounds a lot better so you
might<00:03:20.880> need<00:03:21.060> to<00:03:21.239> get<00:03:21.419> a<00:03:21.450> sense<00:03:21.780> of<00:03:21.989> where<00:03:22.290> your

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 
might need to get a sense of where your

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:24.830 
might need to get a sense of where your
head<00:03:22.769> placement<00:03:23.370> is<00:03:23.489> and<00:03:23.700> that<00:03:24.329> also<00:03:24.510> means

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:24.840 
head placement is and that also means

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:26.809 
head placement is and that also means
that<00:03:24.900> if<00:03:25.079> your<00:03:25.230> band<00:03:25.410> director<00:03:25.950> in<00:03:26.190> marching

parallel to the ground you better make

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:34.940 
parallel to the ground you better make
sure<00:03:31.680> your<00:03:32.010> head<00:03:32.310> also<00:03:33.290> doesn't<00:03:34.290> tilt<00:03:34.500> because

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:34.950 
sure your head also doesn't tilt because

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:35.900

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:23.300 
straight to the audience but tilting a
little<00:04:21.060> bit<00:04:21.180> at<00:04:21.299> an<00:04:21.389> angle<00:04:21.770> it's<00:04:22.770> good<00:04:23.069> for

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:23.310 
little bit at an angle it's good for

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:25.010 
little bit at an angle it's good for
playing<00:04:23.580> in<00:04:23.759> a<00:04:23.819> group<00:04:23.970> because<00:04:24.419> then<00:04:24.660> your

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:25.020 
playing in a group because then your

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:27.800 
playing in a group because then your
flute<00:04:25.379> goes<00:04:25.710> between<00:04:26.250> the<00:04:26.849> players<00:04:27.629> and

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:27.810 
flute goes between the players and

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:29.659 
flute goes between the players and
you're<00:04:28.199> not<00:04:28.349> bumping<00:04:28.830> somebody<00:04:29.280> in<00:04:29.400> the<00:04:29.490> head

00:04:29.659 --> 00:04:29.669 
you're not bumping somebody in the head

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:31.820 
you're not bumping somebody in the head
but<00:04:30.180> there's<00:04:30.389> a<00:04:30.569> more<00:04:30.900> important<00:04:31.349> reason<00:04:31.530> to

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:31.830 
but there's a more important reason to

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:33.260 
but there's a more important reason to
play<00:04:31.979> this<00:04:32.129> way<00:04:32.280> that<00:04:32.460> has<00:04:32.580> to<00:04:32.699> do<00:04:32.819> with<00:04:32.909> sound

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:33.270 
play this way that has to do with sound

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:36.020 
play this way that has to do with sound
and<00:04:33.690> I'd<00:04:34.500> like<00:04:35.039> you<00:04:35.220> to<00:04:35.340> look<00:04:35.580> at<00:04:35.789> some

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:36.030 
and I'd like you to look at some

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:38.450 
and I'd like you to look at some
pictures<00:04:36.479> of<00:04:36.780> one<00:04:36.930> of<00:04:37.080> the<00:04:37.560> greatest<00:04:37.949> flutist

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:38.460 
pictures of one of the greatest flutist

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:40.309 
pictures of one of the greatest flutist
of<00:04:38.550> all<00:04:38.699> time<00:04:39.000> one<00:04:39.330> of<00:04:39.419> my<00:04:39.509> favorite<00:04:39.900> flutist

00:04:40.309 --> 00:04:40.319 
of all time one of my favorite flutist

00:04:40.319 --> 00:04:44.089 
of all time one of my favorite flutist
jean-pierre<00:04:41.120> Rampal<00:04:42.409> look<00:04:43.409> first<00:04:43.830> of<00:04:43.949> all

00:04:44.089 --> 00:04:44.099 
jean-pierre Rampal look first of all

00:04:44.099 --> 00:04:46.850 
jean-pierre Rampal look first of all
when<00:04:44.250> he<00:04:44.400> plays<00:04:44.669> at<00:04:44.940> how<00:04:45.870> his<00:04:46.169> flute<00:04:46.470> is<00:04:46.650> not

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:46.860 
when he plays at how his flute is not

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:48.830 
when he plays at how his flute is not
parallel<00:04:47.340> to<00:04:47.370> the<00:04:47.520> ground<00:04:47.759> because<00:04:48.509> his<00:04:48.659> head

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:48.840 
parallel to the ground because his head

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:51.710 
parallel to the ground because his head
tilts<00:04:49.199> but<00:04:50.069> then<00:04:50.190> also<00:04:50.639> look<00:04:50.970> at<00:04:51.180> how<00:04:51.659> he

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:51.720 
tilts but then also look at how he

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:54.439 
tilts but then also look at how he
aligns<00:04:52.199> his<00:04:52.470> shoulders<00:04:52.919> when<00:04:53.099> he<00:04:53.250> plays<00:04:53.490> this

00:04:54.439 --> 00:04:54.449 
aligns his shoulders when he plays this

00:04:54.449 --> 00:04:56.480 
aligns his shoulders when he plays this
is<00:04:54.509> what<00:04:54.810> he<00:04:54.930> does<00:04:55.110> and<00:04:55.380> what<00:04:55.440> I<00:04:55.530> think<00:04:55.949> is<00:04:56.130> a

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:56.490 
is what he does and what I think is a

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:59.089 
is what he does and what I think is a
wonderful<00:04:56.990> little<00:04:57.990> adjustment<00:04:58.620> to<00:04:58.710> posture

00:04:59.089 --> 00:04:59.099 
wonderful little adjustment to posture

00:04:59.099 --> 00:05:01.939 
wonderful little adjustment to posture
that<00:04:59.220> can<00:04:59.430> have<00:04:59.610> a<00:04:59.639> big<00:04:59.729> impact<00:05:00.150> on<00:05:00.599> sac<00:05:00.949> first

00:05:01.939 --> 00:05:01.949 
that can have a big impact on sac first

00:05:01.949 --> 00:05:06.589 
that can have a big impact on sac first
of<00:05:02.099> all<00:05:02.250> instead<00:05:03.060> of<00:05:03.270> playing<00:05:04.069> straight<00:05:05.599> angle

00:05:06.589 --> 00:05:06.599 
of all instead of playing straight angle

00:05:06.599 --> 00:05:10.159 
of all instead of playing straight angle
yourself<00:05:07.110> so<00:05:07.919> that<00:05:08.130> your<00:05:08.430> left<00:05:08.960> shoulder<00:05:09.960> is

00:05:10.159 --> 00:05:10.169 
yourself so that your left shoulder is

00:05:10.169 --> 00:05:12.499 
yourself so that your left shoulder is
forward<00:05:10.800> toward<00:05:11.130> the<00:05:11.280> audience<00:05:11.430> and<00:05:11.940> your

00:05:12.499 --> 00:05:12.509 
forward toward the audience and your

00:05:12.509 --> 00:05:14.180 
forward toward the audience and your
right<00:05:12.690> shoulder<00:05:13.110> is<00:05:13.319> pointed<00:05:13.740> back<00:05:13.919> a<00:05:13.949> little

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:14.190 
right shoulder is pointed back a little

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:15.320 
right shoulder is pointed back a little
bit<00:05:14.340> so<00:05:14.460> you're<00:05:14.550> actually<00:05:14.909> going<00:05:15.060> to<00:05:15.120> turn

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:15.330 
bit so you're actually going to turn

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:19.550 
bit so you're actually going to turn
your<00:05:15.599> feet<00:05:16.490> to<00:05:17.490> point<00:05:17.759> that<00:05:18.419> way<00:05:18.690> a<00:05:19.020> little<00:05:19.409> bit

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:19.560 
your feet to point that way a little bit

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:21.529 
your feet to point that way a little bit
sideways<00:05:20.069> my<00:05:20.250> feet<00:05:20.550> are<00:05:20.759> no<00:05:20.909> longer<00:05:21.210> pointing

00:05:21.529 --> 00:05:21.539 
sideways my feet are no longer pointing

00:05:21.539 --> 00:05:23.959 
sideways my feet are no longer pointing
the<00:05:21.810> audience<00:05:22.340> they're<00:05:23.340> pointing<00:05:23.699> to<00:05:23.849> the

00:05:23.959 --> 00:05:23.969 
the audience they're pointing to the

00:05:23.969 --> 00:05:26.149 
the audience they're pointing to the
side<00:05:24.180> and<00:05:24.479> so<00:05:25.050> my<00:05:25.199> left<00:05:25.409> shoulder<00:05:25.710> is<00:05:26.009> now

00:05:26.149 --> 00:05:26.159 
side and so my left shoulder is now

00:05:26.159 --> 00:05:28.360 
side and so my left shoulder is now
closer<00:05:26.550> to<00:05:26.699> you<00:05:26.969> than<00:05:27.599> my<00:05:27.780> right<00:05:27.930> shoulder

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:28.370 
closer to you than my right shoulder

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:31.219 
closer to you than my right shoulder
then<00:05:29.370> what<00:05:29.550> I'm<00:05:29.669> going<00:05:29.909> to<00:05:29.969> do<00:05:30.180> is<00:05:30.630> I'm<00:05:31.020> going

00:05:31.219 --> 00:05:31.229 
then what I'm going to do is I'm going

00:05:31.229 --> 00:05:33.589 
then what I'm going to do is I'm going
to<00:05:31.319> tilt<00:05:31.650> my<00:05:31.830> head<00:05:31.860> a<00:05:32.310> little<00:05:32.940> bit<00:05:33.210> toward<00:05:33.509> the

00:05:33.589 --> 00:05:33.599 
to tilt my head a little bit toward the

00:05:33.599 --> 00:05:37.010 
to tilt my head a little bit toward the
audience<00:05:33.810> toward<00:05:34.620> this<00:05:34.860> shoulder<00:05:35.190> and<00:05:36.020> I'm

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:37.020 
audience toward this shoulder and I'm

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:39.559 
audience toward this shoulder and I'm
going<00:05:37.259> to<00:05:37.380> play<00:05:37.560> that<00:05:38.069> way<00:05:38.340> so<00:05:39.029> now<00:05:39.300> I'm

00:05:39.559 --> 00:05:39.569 
going to play that way so now I'm

00:05:39.569 --> 00:05:41.899 
going to play that way so now I'm
playing<00:05:39.900> across<00:05:40.349> my<00:05:40.740> shoulder<00:05:41.219> instead<00:05:41.729> of

00:05:41.899 --> 00:05:41.909 
playing across my shoulder instead of

00:05:41.909 --> 00:05:45.320 
playing across my shoulder instead of
across<00:05:42.500> straight<00:05:43.500> from<00:05:43.710> my<00:05:43.860> chest<00:05:44.330> you're

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:45.330 
across straight from my chest you're

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:47.149 
across straight from my chest you're
going<00:05:45.360> to<00:05:45.630> see<00:05:45.840> that<00:05:45.990> it<00:05:46.139> does<00:05:46.319> something<00:05:46.919> to

00:05:47.149 --> 00:05:47.159 
going to see that it does something to

00:05:47.159 --> 00:05:49.850 
going to see that it does something to
the<00:05:47.250> airflow<00:05:47.909> and<00:05:47.940> it<00:05:48.240> opens<00:05:48.539> up<00:05:48.659> the<00:05:48.810> sound<00:05:49.080> so

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:49.860 
the airflow and it opens up the sound so

00:05:49.860 --> 00:06:03.100 
the airflow and it opens up the sound so
this<00:05:50.009> is<00:05:50.130> playing<00:05:50.310> straight<00:05:57.620> again

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:03.110 

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:07.250 

now<00:06:04.110> I'm<00:06:04.230> going<00:06:04.470> to<00:06:04.530> try<00:06:05.390> tilting<00:06:06.390> my<00:06:06.870> chin

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:07.260 
now I'm going to try tilting my chin

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:39.270 
now I'm going to try tilting my chin
toward<00:06:07.680> this<00:06:07.830> left<00:06:08.430> shoulder<00:06:15.440> again

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:39.280 

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:45.480 

yeah

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:45.490 

00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:48.369 

it<00:06:46.490> really<00:06:46.849> opens<00:06:47.150> up<00:06:47.240> the<00:06:47.389> sound<00:06:47.629> I<00:06:47.870> hope<00:06:48.199> you

00:06:48.369 --> 00:06:48.379 
it really opens up the sound I hope you

00:06:48.379 --> 00:06:50.230 
it really opens up the sound I hope you
can<00:06:48.560> hear<00:06:48.830> it<00:06:48.949> through<00:06:49.220> the<00:06:49.280> video<00:06:49.550> camera

00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:50.240 
can hear it through the video camera

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:52.480 
can hear it through the video camera
I<00:06:50.270> can<00:06:50.810> hear<00:06:50.990> it<00:06:51.020> really<00:06:51.440> well<00:06:51.620> here<00:06:52.220> in<00:06:52.370> this

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:52.490 
I can hear it really well here in this

00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:55.270 
I can hear it really well here in this
room<00:06:52.759> so<00:06:53.509> experiment<00:06:54.139> with<00:06:54.169> that<00:06:54.470> and<00:06:54.740> tell<00:06:55.250> me

00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:55.280 
room so experiment with that and tell me

00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:57.819 
room so experiment with that and tell me
what<00:06:55.400> you<00:06:55.580> think
