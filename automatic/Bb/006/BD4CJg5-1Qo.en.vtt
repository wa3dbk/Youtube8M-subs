00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:08.670 
of Mexico then different types of

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:11.900 
of Mexico then different types of
textures<00:00:09.300> in<00:00:09.570> this<00:00:09.690> one<00:00:09.870> using<00:00:10.230> the<00:00:10.320> g25<00:00:10.830> I<00:00:11.370> see

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
textures in this one using the g25 I see

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.840 
textures in this one using the g25 I see
how<00:00:11.970> we<00:00:12.060> get<00:00:12.180> on<00:00:12.290> so<00:00:13.290> on<00:00:13.590> to<00:00:13.950> the<00:00:14.190> third<00:00:14.490> rally

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:14.850 
how we get on so on to the third rally

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:18.710 
how we get on so on to the third rally
of<00:00:15.120> course<00:00:15.390> Mexico<00:00:16.789> and<00:00:17.789> waiting<00:00:18.300> for<00:00:18.630> the

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
of course Mexico and waiting for the

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.650 
of course Mexico and waiting for the
light<00:00:19.020> to<00:00:19.050> change<00:00:19.350> and<00:00:19.980> away<00:00:20.640> we<00:00:20.820> go<00:00:20.849> straight

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660

light to change and away we go straight
away<00:00:21.810> up<00:00:22.289> into<00:00:22.619> first<00:00:22.859> and<00:00:23.390> getting<00:00:24.390> through

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
away up into first and getting through

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:25.669 
away up into first and getting through
these<00:00:24.689> first<00:00:24.839> couple<00:00:25.050> of<00:00:25.199> quarters<00:00:25.410> which<00:00:25.560> are

00:00:25.669 --> 00:00:25.679 
these first couple of quarters which are

00:00:25.679 --> 00:00:27.769 
these first couple of quarters which are
quickly<00:00:25.859> upon<00:00:26.279> you<00:00:26.460> straight<00:00:27.390> away<00:00:27.509> we're

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
quickly upon you straight away we're

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:29.929 
quickly upon you straight away we're
away<00:00:27.990> from<00:00:28.259> that<00:00:28.380> snow<00:00:28.740> away<00:00:29.039> from<00:00:29.339> that<00:00:29.429> ice<00:00:29.579> I

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
away from that snow away from that ice I

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:31.970 
away from that snow away from that ice I
feel<00:00:30.119> much<00:00:30.359> more<00:00:30.630> comfortable<00:00:30.810> now<00:00:31.349> with<00:00:31.589> the

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
feel much more comfortable now with the

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.360 
feel much more comfortable now with the
texture<00:00:32.840> this<00:00:33.840> wasn't<00:00:34.079> my<00:00:34.320> best<00:00:34.590> driver<00:00:34.980> did<00:00:35.310> a

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
texture this wasn't my best driver did a

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:41.540 
texture this wasn't my best driver did a
couple<00:00:35.520> of<00:00:35.730> drives<00:00:35.940> on<00:00:36.180> this<00:00:36.329> stage<00:00:37.079> but<00:00:37.649> I<00:00:40.550> was

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
couple of drives on this stage but I was

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.580 
couple of drives on this stage but I was
actually<00:00:41.640> more<00:00:42.269> used<00:00:42.629> at<00:00:42.840> this<00:00:42.960> point<00:00:43.230> to<00:00:43.440> the

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
actually more used at this point to the

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.619 
actually more used at this point to the
CSR<00:00:44.430> elite<00:00:44.730> wheel<00:00:44.940> which<00:00:45.149> I<00:00:45.269> felt<00:00:45.510> more

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
CSR elite wheel which I felt more

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.950 
CSR elite wheel which I felt more
comfortable<00:00:45.780> with<00:00:46.609> so<00:00:47.609> I<00:00:47.640> was<00:00:47.760> using<00:00:47.940> the<00:00:48.149> old

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
comfortable with so I was using the old

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.340 
comfortable with so I was using the old
sport<00:00:49.320> rstand<00:00:50.570> had<00:00:51.570> to<00:00:51.690> slow<00:00:51.840> down<00:00:52.019> for<00:00:52.260> that

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
sport rstand had to slow down for that

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:53.810 
sport rstand had to slow down for that
jump<00:00:52.590> now<00:00:52.800> if<00:00:52.859> you<00:00:53.070> don't<00:00:53.250> cause<00:00:53.550> you<00:00:53.579> some

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
jump now if you don't cause you some

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.610 
jump now if you don't cause you some
damage<00:00:54.210> and<00:00:54.239> and<00:00:54.780> then<00:00:55.050> just<00:00:55.199> to<00:00:55.350> gain<00:00:55.500> up

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
damage and and then just to gain up

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.579 
damage and and then just to gain up
speed<00:00:56.010> on<00:00:56.190> that<00:00:56.309> slide<00:00:56.640> so<00:00:57.059> it<00:00:57.719> over<00:00:58.050> steer<00:00:58.320> for

00:00:58.579 --> 00:00:58.589 
speed on that slide so it over steer for

00:00:58.589 --> 00:01:00.380 
speed on that slide so it over steer for
me<00:00:58.769> into<00:00:58.980> the<00:00:59.070> corner<00:00:59.489> and<00:00:59.519> I<00:00:59.670> to<00:00:59.730> correct<00:01:00.239> that

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
me into the corner and I to correct that

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:05.360 
me into the corner and I to correct that
possibly<00:01:01.289> did<00:01:01.469> some<00:01:01.649> damage<00:01:03.830> it's<00:01:04.830> completely

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:05.370 
possibly did some damage it's completely

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:06.500 
possibly did some damage it's completely
different<00:01:05.489> texture<00:01:05.910> you<00:01:06.000> need<00:01:06.120> to<00:01:06.180> be<00:01:06.270> very

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
different texture you need to be very

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.890 
different texture you need to be very
aggressive<00:01:06.840> from<00:01:07.380> the<00:01:07.409> power<00:01:08.329> the<00:01:09.329> cars<00:01:09.689> much

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
aggressive from the power the cars much

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.100 
aggressive from the power the cars much
slower<00:01:10.259> on<00:01:10.530> this<00:01:10.650> texture<00:01:11.630> right<00:01:12.630> down<00:01:12.900> into

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
slower on this texture right down into

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:14.569 
slower on this texture right down into
first<00:01:13.470> there<00:01:13.799> I'll<00:01:13.950> just<00:01:14.100> want<00:01:14.280> to<00:01:14.369> make<00:01:14.520> sure

00:01:14.569 --> 00:01:14.579 
first there I'll just want to make sure

00:01:14.579 --> 00:01:16.870 
first there I'll just want to make sure
what<00:01:15.090> it<00:01:15.210> makes<00:01:15.420> straight<00:01:15.810> off<00:01:16.020> the<00:01:16.049> edge

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:16.880 
what it makes straight off the edge

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:22.880 
what it makes straight off the edge
listening<00:01:17.880> intently<00:01:18.270> to<00:01:18.869> my<00:01:19.710> co-driver<00:01:21.890> you

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
listening intently to my co-driver you

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.490 
listening intently to my co-driver you
can<00:01:23.070> fall<00:01:23.220> off<00:01:23.250> at<00:01:23.490> any<00:01:23.549> time<00:01:23.909> so<00:01:24.500> you're

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
can fall off at any time so you're

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.760 
can fall off at any time so you're
really<00:01:25.829> focusing<00:01:26.790> entirely<00:01:27.210> on<00:01:27.450> that<00:01:28.229> if

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
really focusing entirely on that if

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.020 
really focusing entirely on that if
you're<00:01:29.009> not<00:01:29.100> listening<00:01:29.490> to<00:01:29.520> your<00:01:29.700> co-driver

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
you're not listening to your co-driver

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.590 
you're not listening to your co-driver
you're<00:01:30.509> going<00:01:30.659> to<00:01:30.750> be<00:01:30.920> into<00:01:31.920> a<00:01:31.950> wall<00:01:32.850> or<00:01:32.880> off<00:01:33.540> a

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
you're going to be into a wall or off a

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.410 
you're going to be into a wall or off a
cliff<00:01:34.020> so<00:01:34.500> and<00:01:34.979> this<00:01:35.579> is<00:01:35.729> a<00:01:35.759> really<00:01:36.180> technical

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
cliff so and this is a really technical

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:41.209 
cliff so and this is a really technical
course<00:01:37.409> there<00:01:37.850> so<00:01:38.850> you're<00:01:39.590> you're<00:01:40.590> really

00:01:41.209 --> 00:01:41.219 
course there so you're you're really

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:43.100 
course there so you're you're really
focusing<00:01:41.640> constantly<00:01:42.119> there's<00:01:42.659> always<00:01:42.810> a

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
focusing constantly there's always a

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.469 
focusing constantly there's always a
different<00:01:43.530> corner<00:01:43.740> upon<00:01:44.159> you<00:01:44.340> and<00:01:45.210> you<00:01:45.329> could

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
different corner upon you and you could

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:48.050 
different corner upon you and you could
take<00:01:45.659> a<00:01:45.689> lot<00:01:45.930> slower<00:01:46.320> but<00:01:46.740> that's<00:01:47.729> not<00:01:47.880> what

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
take a lot slower but that's not what

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.469 
take a lot slower but that's not what
it's<00:01:48.180> all<00:01:48.270> about<00:01:48.299> is<00:01:48.719> it<00:01:48.750> it's<00:01:49.020> always<00:01:49.320> about

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:50.479 
it's all about is it it's always about

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:53.420 
it's all about is it it's always about
hammering<00:01:51.479> the<00:01:51.630> car<00:01:51.920> getting<00:01:52.920> the<00:01:53.009> most<00:01:53.039> you

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
hammering the car getting the most you

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.330 
hammering the car getting the most you
can<00:01:53.460> out<00:01:53.789> of<00:01:53.850> it<00:01:54.060> oh<00:01:54.829> I'll<00:01:55.829> pretty<00:01:56.039> close<00:01:56.219> to

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
can out of it oh I'll pretty close to

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:57.679 
can out of it oh I'll pretty close to
the<00:01:56.399> edge<00:01:56.549> again<00:01:56.850> there<00:01:57.090> but<00:01:57.270> kept<00:01:57.450> it<00:01:57.570> on

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
the edge again there but kept it on

00:01:57.689 --> 00:01:59.420 
the edge again there but kept it on
there<00:01:57.899> because<00:01:58.200> I<00:01:58.469> was<00:01:58.560> in<00:01:58.649> the<00:01:58.740> wrong<00:01:58.770> gear<00:01:59.159> so

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
there because I was in the wrong gear so

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:02.090 
there because I was in the wrong gear so
I<00:01:59.460> just<00:01:59.609> had<00:01:59.759> to<00:01:59.789> select<00:02:00.320> that's<00:02:01.320> a<00:02:01.439> second<00:02:01.950> a

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
I just had to select that's a second a

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.580 
I just had to select that's a second a
lot<00:02:02.460> of<00:02:02.490> gear<00:02:02.700> changes<00:02:03.270> on<00:02:03.509> this<00:02:03.659> particular

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
lot of gear changes on this particular

rally<00:02:47.310> stages<00:02:48.000> oh<00:02:49.579> the<00:02:50.579> easier<00:02:50.970> part<00:02:51.209> is

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
rally stages oh the easier part is

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:54.199 
rally stages oh the easier part is
obviously<00:02:51.750> coming<00:02:52.049> down<00:02:52.260> the<00:02:52.470> hill<00:02:52.650> now<00:02:52.890> I<00:02:53.209> say

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:54.209 
obviously coming down the hill now I say

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:57.020 
obviously coming down the hill now I say
that<00:02:54.239> as<00:02:54.420> I<00:02:54.569> make<00:02:54.780> a<00:02:54.810> mistake<00:02:55.019> and<00:02:55.880> you<00:02:56.880> see

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
that as I make a mistake and you see

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:59.059 
that as I make a mistake and you see
it's<00:02:57.150> a<00:02:57.239> kind<00:02:57.510> of<00:02:57.860> concentration<00:02:58.860> where<00:02:58.980> you

00:02:59.059 --> 00:02:59.069 
it's a kind of concentration where you

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:00.890 
it's a kind of concentration where you
think<00:02:59.250> it's<00:02:59.370> easier<00:02:59.730> and<00:02:59.760> then<00:02:59.970> it<00:03:00.120> jumps<00:03:00.720> that

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
think it's easier and then it jumps that

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:02.690 
think it's easier and then it jumps that
in<00:03:01.049> your<00:03:01.200> way<00:03:01.319> suddenly<00:03:01.680> you've<00:03:02.220> got<00:03:02.370> st.<00:03:02.610> to

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
in your way suddenly you've got st. to

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:05.960 
in your way suddenly you've got st. to
avoid<00:03:03.019> so<00:03:04.019> last<00:03:04.440> few<00:03:04.650> corners<00:03:04.890> leatherby<00:03:05.730> slow

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970

didn't<00:03:07.560> turning<00:03:07.920> sometimes<00:03:08.310> you<00:03:08.459> need<00:03:08.579> to

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640 
didn't turning sometimes you need to

didn't turning sometimes you need to
punch<00:03:09.090> the<00:03:09.360> break<00:03:09.569> a<00:03:09.599> bit<00:03:09.870> harder<00:03:10.260> to<00:03:10.410> get<00:03:10.530> the

experience and learning h texture works

00:03:16.109 --> 00:03:18.050 
experience and learning h texture works
but<00:03:16.350> that's<00:03:16.530> stage<00:03:16.799> one<00:03:16.829> from<00:03:17.579> the<00:03:17.670> rally<00:03:17.880> of

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060 
but that's stage one from the rally of

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:23.210 
but that's stage one from the rally of
mexico<00:03:19.940> so<00:03:20.940> that<00:03:21.180> was<00:03:21.329> mexico<00:03:22.079> using<00:03:22.650> the<00:03:22.769> g25

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
mexico so that was mexico using the g25

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:25.789 
mexico so that was mexico using the g25
was<00:03:23.670> using<00:03:23.910> the<00:03:24.000> l<00:03:24.150> RS<00:03:24.930> will<00:03:25.139> stand<00:03:25.500> which<00:03:25.680> is

00:03:25.789 --> 00:03:25.799 
was using the l RS will stand which is

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:26.930 
was using the l RS will stand which is
quite<00:03:25.920> handy<00:03:25.980> when<00:03:26.400> swapping<00:03:26.549> the<00:03:26.760> wheels

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:26.940 
quite handy when swapping the wheels

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:30.650 
quite handy when swapping the wheels
over<00:03:28.190> quite<00:03:29.190> challenging<00:03:29.400> lots<00:03:29.880> of<00:03:30.060> blind

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:30.660 
over quite challenging lots of blind

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:32.479 
over quite challenging lots of blind
corners<00:03:31.290> and<00:03:31.590> you're<00:03:31.769> on<00:03:31.889> the<00:03:32.040> edge<00:03:32.130> of<00:03:32.310> this

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:32.489 
corners and you're on the edge of this

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:33.979 
corners and you're on the edge of this
constantly<00:03:33.450> on<00:03:33.600> the<00:03:33.630> edge<00:03:33.780> of<00:03:33.840> this<00:03:33.930> cliff

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:33.989 
constantly on the edge of this cliff

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:36.590 
constantly on the edge of this cliff
face<00:03:34.410> so<00:03:34.650> it's<00:03:34.769> quite<00:03:34.980> a<00:03:35.060> risky<00:03:36.060> place<00:03:36.269> to<00:03:36.510> do

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:36.600 
face so it's quite a risky place to do

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:38.990 
face so it's quite a risky place to do
your<00:03:36.630> alley<00:03:37.220> either<00:03:38.220> way<00:03:38.430> it's<00:03:38.670> a<00:03:38.760> good

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.000 
your alley either way it's a good

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.750 
your alley either way it's a good
challenge<00:03:39.180> a<00:03:39.450> lot<00:03:39.600> of<00:03:39.720> fun<00:03:39.900> and<00:03:40.670> certainly<00:03:41.670> I

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:41.760 
challenge a lot of fun and certainly I

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:42.979 
challenge a lot of fun and certainly I
think<00:03:41.850> there's<00:03:42.150> a<00:03:42.180> lot<00:03:42.209> more<00:03:42.389> time<00:03:42.720> to<00:03:42.900> be

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:42.989 
think there's a lot more time to be

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:44.390 
think there's a lot more time to be
gained<00:03:43.200> on<00:03:43.380> it<00:03:43.470> as<00:03:43.560> well<00:03:43.739> that<00:03:43.950> was<00:03:44.040> literally

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:44.400 
gained on it as well that was literally

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.699 
gained on it as well that was literally
just<00:03:44.639> learning<00:03:45.299> it<00:03:45.450> learning<00:03:46.170> the<00:03:46.260> stage<00:03:46.500> and

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:46.709 
just learning it learning the stage and

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:48.800 
just learning it learning the stage and
seeing<00:03:46.920> how<00:03:47.040> the<00:03:47.100> car<00:03:47.370> handles<00:03:47.790> but<00:03:48.030> on<00:03:48.420> to<00:03:48.720> the

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:48.810 
seeing how the car handles but on to the
