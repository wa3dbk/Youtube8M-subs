the<00:01:41.759> year<00:01:41.909> 2011<00:01:42.780> so<00:01:42.960> plutonium<00:01:43.619> and<00:01:43.710> a<00:01:43.799> flux

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
the year 2011 so plutonium and a flux

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.800 
the year 2011 so plutonium and a flux
capacitor<00:01:44.100> is<00:01:44.729> available<00:01:45.240> in<00:01:45.360> any<00:01:45.509> corner

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
capacitor is available in any corner

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.429 
capacitor is available in any corner
drugstore<00:01:46.409> isn't<00:01:46.710> it<00:01:46.799> well<00:01:47.220> I<00:01:47.460> think<00:01:48.299> not<00:01:48.750> but

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
drugstore isn't it well I think not but

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:52.100 
drugstore isn't it well I think not but
anyway<00:01:49.850> wouldn't<00:01:50.850> it<00:01:50.939> be<00:01:51.030> amazing<00:01:51.060> to<00:01:51.689> be<00:01:51.990> able

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
anyway wouldn't it be amazing to be able

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.830 
anyway wouldn't it be amazing to be able
to<00:01:52.290> say<00:01:52.470> hey<00:01:52.710> I<00:01:52.950> want<00:01:53.040> to<00:01:53.340> go<00:01:53.460> back<00:01:53.490> in<00:01:53.970> our<00:01:54.360> into

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
to say hey I want to go back in our into

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.719 
to say hey I want to go back in our into
the<00:01:54.960> past<00:01:55.229> and<00:01:55.530> make<00:01:55.920> sure<00:01:55.950> that<00:01:56.369> I<00:01:56.399> didn't

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
the past and make sure that I didn't

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.429 
the past and make sure that I didn't
screw<00:01:56.969> up<00:01:57.030> that<00:01:57.119> date<00:01:57.540> with<00:01:57.719> that<00:01:57.869> really<00:01:58.229> hot

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
screw up that date with that really hot

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.109 
screw up that date with that really hot
girl<00:01:58.710> that<00:01:58.979> I<00:01:59.009> was<00:01:59.189> going<00:01:59.340> to<00:01:59.399> try<00:01:59.549> and<00:01:59.670> you

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
girl that I was going to try and you

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:03.889 
girl that I was going to try and you
know<00:02:00.149> do<00:02:00.600> the<00:02:00.750> dirty<00:02:00.930> dirty<00:02:01.259> with<00:02:01.880> or<00:02:02.899> maybe

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
know do the dirty dirty with or maybe

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:06.260 
know do the dirty dirty with or maybe
you<00:02:04.020> could<00:02:04.200> even<00:02:04.259> go<00:02:04.500> back<00:02:04.530> to<00:02:04.880> 1776<00:02:05.880> and<00:02:06.090> see

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
you could even go back to 1776 and see

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:07.580 
you could even go back to 1776 and see
when<00:02:06.420> they<00:02:06.509> signed<00:02:06.750> the<00:02:06.899> Declaration<00:02:07.530> of

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
when they signed the Declaration of

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.320 
when they signed the Declaration of
Independence<00:02:08.039> or<00:02:08.399> whatever<00:02:08.849> they<00:02:09.030> signed

Independence or whatever they signed

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:10.790 
Independence or whatever they signed
back<00:02:09.569> then<00:02:09.810> i'm<00:02:09.989> pretty<00:02:10.200> sure<00:02:10.440> that<00:02:10.470> that's

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
back then i'm pretty sure that that's

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.200 
back then i'm pretty sure that that's
right<00:02:11.190> my<00:02:11.940> history<00:02:12.330> is<00:02:12.599> a<00:02:12.660> little

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.210 
right my history is a little

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:14.760 
right my history is a little
out<00:02:13.330> of<00:02:13.450> whack<00:02:13.630> because<00:02:13.660> I<00:02:14.260> haven't<00:02:14.470> been<00:02:14.710> in

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:14.770 
out of whack because I haven't been in

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:18.480 
out of whack because I haven't been in
school<00:02:15.010> in<00:02:15.340> a<00:02:15.460> long<00:02:15.610> time<00:02:16.590> but<00:02:17.590> anyway<00:02:17.920> back<00:02:18.310> to

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:18.490 
school in a long time but anyway back to

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:20.790 
school in a long time but anyway back to
the<00:02:18.580> whole<00:02:18.730> time<00:02:19.060> travelling<00:02:19.780> situation<00:02:20.440> now

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:20.800 
the whole time travelling situation now

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:22.950 
the whole time travelling situation now
i<00:02:20.890> love<00:02:21.100> how<00:02:21.250> back<00:02:21.490> to<00:02:21.670> the<00:02:21.760> future<00:02:22.180> they<00:02:22.660> kind

i love how back to the future they kind
of<00:02:23.050> took<00:02:23.320> it<00:02:23.380> in<00:02:23.650> a<00:02:23.920> different<00:02:24.250> angle<00:02:25.120> they

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:25.330 
of took it in a different angle they

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:27.090 
of took it in a different angle they
said<00:02:25.540> well<00:02:25.690> you<00:02:25.840> know<00:02:25.870> what<00:02:26.050> let's<00:02:26.200> turn<00:02:26.440> a<00:02:26.650> car

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:27.100 
said well you know what let's turn a car

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:29.520 
said well you know what let's turn a car
into<00:02:27.460> the<00:02:27.700> time<00:02:28.030> machine<00:02:28.180> device<00:02:28.810> well<00:02:29.500> I

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.530 
into the time machine device well I

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:31.500 
into the time machine device well I
think<00:02:29.770> that<00:02:30.100> this<00:02:30.220> was<00:02:30.430> absolutely<00:02:30.610> an

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:31.510 
think that this was absolutely an

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:33.600 
think that this was absolutely an
amazing<00:02:31.630> idea<00:02:32.230> I<00:02:32.680> mean<00:02:32.920> just<00:02:33.100> the<00:02:33.340> fact<00:02:33.370> that

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:33.610 
amazing idea I mean just the fact that

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:35.310 
amazing idea I mean just the fact that
you<00:02:33.790> could<00:02:33.940> hop<00:02:34.150> in<00:02:34.300> a<00:02:34.360> car<00:02:34.570> get<00:02:34.930> it<00:02:35.050> up<00:02:35.170> to<00:02:35.200> a

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:35.320 
you could hop in a car get it up to a

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:37.680 
you could hop in a car get it up to a
certain<00:02:35.650> miles<00:02:35.980> per<00:02:36.250> hour<00:02:36.400> which<00:02:36.790> 88<00:02:37.450> miles

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:37.690 
certain miles per hour which 88 miles

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:40.350 
certain miles per hour which 88 miles
per<00:02:37.810> hour<00:02:38.050> happened<00:02:38.620> to<00:02:38.710> be<00:02:38.890> the<00:02:39.490> speed<00:02:39.820> that

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:40.360 
per hour happened to be the speed that

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:43.200 
per hour happened to be the speed that
Marty<00:02:40.720> McFly<00:02:41.110> and<00:02:41.140> Doc<00:02:41.380> Brown<00:02:41.890> had<00:02:42.520> said<00:02:42.940> well

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:43.210 
Marty McFly and Doc Brown had said well

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:44.940 
Marty McFly and Doc Brown had said well
what<00:02:43.420> Doc<00:02:43.690> Brown<00:02:43.960> had<00:02:44.200> said<00:02:44.440> it<00:02:44.560> but<00:02:44.680> Marty

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950 
what Doc Brown had said it but Marty

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:48.480 
what Doc Brown had said it but Marty
McFly<00:02:45.310> executed<00:02:46.030> it<00:02:46.410> to<00:02:47.410> you<00:02:47.860> know<00:02:47.950> be<00:02:48.100> able<00:02:48.370> to

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:48.490 
McFly executed it to you know be able to

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:50.940 
McFly executed it to you know be able to
activate<00:02:49.240> the<00:02:49.360> flux<00:02:49.570> capacitor<00:02:49.660> to<00:02:50.470> make<00:02:50.830> them

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:50.950 
activate the flux capacitor to make them

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:53.220 
activate the flux capacitor to make them
travel<00:02:51.310> through<00:02:51.490> time<00:02:51.670> which<00:02:52.480> I<00:02:52.600> thought<00:02:52.810> was

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:53.230 
travel through time which I thought was

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:58.940 
travel through time which I thought was
a<00:02:54.690> quirky<00:02:55.690> quirky<00:02:56.620> but<00:02:57.220> awesome<00:02:57.490> concept<00:02:58.360> and

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
a quirky quirky but awesome concept and

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:01.860 
a quirky quirky but awesome concept and
just<00:02:59.950> the<00:03:00.070> fact<00:03:00.340> of<00:03:00.550> that<00:03:00.880> whole<00:03:01.090> trilogy<00:03:01.390> that

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:01.870 
just the fact of that whole trilogy that

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:04.080 
just the fact of that whole trilogy that
they<00:03:02.590> saw<00:03:02.860> so<00:03:03.160> many<00:03:03.280> different<00:03:03.520> things<00:03:03.760> so

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:04.090 
they saw so many different things so

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:05.760 
they saw so many different things so
many<00:03:04.240> different<00:03:04.450> times<00:03:04.810> the<00:03:05.080> future<00:03:05.410> the<00:03:05.560> past

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:05.770 
many different times the future the past

three<00:03:09.430> movies<00:03:09.760> I<00:03:10.000> thought<00:03:10.210> it<00:03:10.330> was<00:03:10.390> just

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:10.540 
three movies I thought it was just

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:12.960 
three movies I thought it was just
absolutely<00:03:11.050> incredible<00:03:11.140> and<00:03:11.800> all<00:03:12.550> through<00:03:12.850> my

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:12.970 
absolutely incredible and all through my

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:14.430 
absolutely incredible and all through my
life<00:03:13.000> I've<00:03:13.450> always<00:03:13.570> been<00:03:13.870> jealous<00:03:14.140> of<00:03:14.350> the

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:14.440 
life I've always been jealous of the

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:16.950 
life I've always been jealous of the
fact<00:03:14.470> that<00:03:14.860> although<00:03:15.220> it<00:03:15.460> is<00:03:15.550> fiction<00:03:16.030> it<00:03:16.210> just

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:16.960 
fact that although it is fiction it just

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:19.080 
fact that although it is fiction it just
felt<00:03:17.290> so<00:03:17.380> real<00:03:17.800> it<00:03:18.010> felt<00:03:18.220> like<00:03:18.370> we<00:03:18.520> were<00:03:18.550> a<00:03:18.700> part

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:19.090 
felt so real it felt like we were a part

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:20.210 
felt so real it felt like we were a part
of<00:03:19.210> it<00:03:19.360> and<00:03:19.510> that<00:03:19.540> we<00:03:19.690> were<00:03:19.840> actually

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220 
of it and that we were actually

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:22.710 
of it and that we were actually
experiencing<00:03:21.220> what<00:03:21.700> Marty<00:03:22.060> McFly<00:03:22.450> and<00:03:22.480> Doc

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:22.720

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:25.170 
Brown were experiencing in the movies
