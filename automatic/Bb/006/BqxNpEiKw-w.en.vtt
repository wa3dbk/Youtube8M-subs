patchy looking job differently colored
gels<00:02:27.980> create<00:02:28.520> different<00:02:28.970> effects<00:02:29.320> this

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:30.320 
gels create different effects this

so<00:02:33.020> it's<00:02:33.200> more<00:02:33.410> like<00:02:33.590> indoor<00:02:34.040> lighting<00:02:34.310> that's

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:34.970 
so it's more like indoor lighting that's
