00:00:08.199 --> 00:00:11.019
 legend has discussed what is considered full-fledged in 

00:00:11.019 --> 00:00:12.419
 past 

00:00:12.419 --> 00:00:15.280
 I think there will be those who want the whole plan. 

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:18.280
 now directed by Nazism 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:37.920
 what is plasma cutting 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.670
 now it is the most effective way 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:41.900
 metal section 

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:43.410
 high temperature flow 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.480
 plasma reaching twenty thousand 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.860
 degrees centigrade allows us to cut 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:50.300
 metal thinner than thick pair 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:50.969
 millimeters 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.969
 with high speed 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:57.600
 manufacturability bank Soviet gymnast 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.190
 serdyuk material processing height 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:02.179
 low cost of material processing 

00:01:02.179 --> 00:01:04.379
 flexibility but in terms of applying different 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.000
 figure cutting drawings range 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.680
 processed thickness 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:10.400
 range of materials that we 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.480
 we can process one plasma 

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:14.310
 machine allows us 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.310
 says something not the instrument itself 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:20.189
 plasma cutting speed 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:23.250
 ten times higher than hectares of land 51 close 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.580
 four times cheaper than laser cutting 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:28.010
 and 10 5 cheaper to buy for Brazil 

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:30.280
 it acts as a get 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:31.350
 nutrition 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:32.900
 countries failed 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:35.630
 cost of making holes in detail 4 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:36.450
 times less 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.450
 and the speed is 10 times higher 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:44.049
 after the arrest is good because she can 

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:45.070
 process 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:47.510
 any metal only conductive it can 

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:49.440
 be and aluminum pedals menu properly 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:51.640
 Mityaev brass alloy 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:53.010
 any constructional 

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:53.580
 slept 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:56.770
 and in the flesh to b tank armor titanium 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:00.760
 the main source is 

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:02.380
 difficult period and mechanically 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:03.690
 units using 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:05.540
 electrical high voltage and 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:06.570
 big three 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.719
 various gas mixtures and year 

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:10.699
 such freedom 

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:13.029
 tape media farms using accurate 

00:02:13.029 --> 00:02:14.430
 coordinates and machine tools 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:16.270
 plasma applications which can 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:17.399
 produce 

00:02:17.399 --> 00:02:18.489
 for sheet cutting 

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:20.090
 rolled metal with pretentious 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:23.090
 accuracy of physical persons 

00:02:25.969 --> 00:02:28.569
 but this details are visible three times 

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:30.439
 processing is mechanical 

00:02:30.439 --> 00:02:32.919
 we probably had this treatment 

00:02:32.919 --> 00:02:35.579
 made simple with Bulgarian translation 

00:02:35.579 --> 00:02:37.040
 a small piece did 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:39.290
 he just has to cut this cut 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:41.730
 made recognized and sharpness 150 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:43.760
 millimeters with a thickness of 30 millimeters 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:46.420
 mean and the thickness of the material here with 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:49.420
 means he was done in 30 seconds 

00:02:50.909 --> 00:02:52.790
 besides high cutting speed 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:53.700
 metal i would 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.439
 worth of paid 

00:02:55.439 --> 00:02:56.719
 can be attributed receiving 

00:02:56.719 --> 00:02:58.289
 quality 

00:02:58.289 --> 00:03:00.129
 the example shows the details 

00:03:00.129 --> 00:03:02.189
 clearly visible quality 

00:03:02.189 --> 00:03:04.389
 this smooth and even surface is not 

00:03:04.389 --> 00:03:06.409
 requiring additional work 

00:03:06.409 --> 00:03:08.790
 can be optimal for kindergartens 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:11.650
 metal rolling ranging from 30 to 35 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:13.059
 population 

00:03:13.059 --> 00:03:15.419
 while this technology is great 

00:03:15.419 --> 00:03:17.339
 copes with profit processing 

00:03:17.339 --> 00:03:18.979
 no part areas 

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:20.939
 on the example of several products made 

00:03:20.939 --> 00:03:23.420
 Interfax specialists no 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:25.069
 we can rate the satellite or 

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:28.079
 we have no opportunity 

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:30.169
 with all the advantages of a place to cut 

00:03:30.169 --> 00:03:32.259
 metals class of them he is also extremely 

00:03:32.259 --> 00:03:33.369
 economical 

00:03:33.369 --> 00:03:34.199
 task 

00:03:34.199 --> 00:03:36.910
 plasma cutting cheaper processing 

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:39.720
 simple metal for us can not cope 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:40.809
 cavities 

00:03:40.809 --> 00:03:42.969
 technology on soviet us more 

00:03:42.969 --> 00:03:43.549
 effectively 

00:03:43.549 --> 00:03:44.569
 we have for building 

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:46.219
 organizations for production 

00:03:46.219 --> 00:03:46.889
 mortgages 

00:03:46.889 --> 00:03:49.199
 further lats as a city 

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:51.209
 just design elements first 

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:51.929
 corners 

00:03:51.929 --> 00:03:52.989
 called 

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:55.809
 after italy with holes 

00:03:55.809 --> 00:03:56.979
 at production facilities 

00:03:56.979 --> 00:03:58.809
 contract basis 

00:03:58.809 --> 00:04:00.749
 metal products are made 

00:04:00.749 --> 00:04:02.339
 for various purposes 

00:04:02.339 --> 00:04:04.229
 produced and parts for mass 

00:04:04.229 --> 00:04:06.409
 production but technology allows 

00:04:06.409 --> 00:04:08.589
 quick and economical extra 

00:04:08.589 --> 00:04:09.719
 most katya 

00:04:09.719 --> 00:04:12.279
 designer metal items for 

00:04:12.279 --> 00:04:14.639
 complex equipment 

00:04:14.639 --> 00:04:16.939
 upon receipt of order 

00:04:16.939 --> 00:04:19.929
 we get drawings constructor translation 

00:04:19.929 --> 00:04:21.739
 TEC 4 electronic view 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:24.949
 can translate and file format 

00:04:24.949 --> 00:04:27.680
 the market can already read the country 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:29.100
 if necessary 

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:29.879
 of the material 

00:04:29.879 --> 00:04:32.080
 even the most complex products can be 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:34.539
 made in a short time 

00:04:34.539 --> 00:04:35.350
 what for 

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:37.340
 one day can process an order 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:39.980
 in the morning arrived in the evening the details are ready 

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:42.790
 Mike drove the details for the rest of the matches 

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:45.309

 metal structures which are made 

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:39.970
 it is our enterprises that are ours to us 

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:42.850
 equipment amounts are proud that we 

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:44.160
 use not only modern 

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:45.309
 achievements but 

00:05:45.309 --> 00:05:46.840
 what plasma arrest 

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:48.590
 but also that our momentum 

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:50.080
 he is the most
