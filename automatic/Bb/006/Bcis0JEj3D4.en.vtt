00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:05.240
 welcome to dream here we see if we are 

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:08.990
 here in the simple plugin region market 

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:11.300
 good I will tell you the plugins that you need 

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:15.830
 I will put everything down and you need the 

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:19.070
 bau the icon my 8 I recommend myself and then 

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:22.490
 the simple mart region that version 3.0 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:24.080
 down you have everything and well let's go with 

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:25.789
 they have done here a region let's go 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:27.439
 to save us a little time 

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:29.689
 because they make a region I imagine that 

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:32.809
 you know and the only thing I have done is me 

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:35.300
 region defines the crazy the called and 

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:37.370
 then it gives priority 1 vale 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:40.190
 Then what we are going to do is 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:43.579
 put a sign you do not call someone 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:46.940
 if we do not put it like that the name of the 

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:49.340
 crazy region and the price for example 100 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:51.500
 dollars we are going to remove 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:54.579
 lopez 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:56.590
 as you all know 

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:58.750
 we are going to 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:00.850
 for trying the plot to see if there is 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:03.550
 luck as you see I have bought it without being 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:05.320
 just a member and they bought it for me 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:06.910
 I'm going to give opep to teach them to 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:09.370
 make a hotel because it has changed 

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:11.380
 it is also the good command we are already 

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:13.330
 here again and now the next thing that 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:15.880
 we must do is to work with two 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:20.310
 commands but I created a region here 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:24.240
 the called crazy and works with led 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:27.780
 and also with a network, I've both tried them and 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.460
 It works and should be put would rent 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.700
 that put the region my name I've 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:36.570
 put follies then the price that would be 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:38.850
 I know 100 and a day for example as 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:41.009
 you see down one day this then 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:44.280
 we will catch you and love you and tell us you 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:45.720
 there are 23 hours left one day the bad 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.250
 is that if you press very fast because 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.619
 you want to buy many days is going to be a 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:53.549
 little boring and good another of the 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:56.340
 What's new that it seems to be like that? 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:59.069
 very new we are going to catch this here and 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.479
 do some auction and auction regions 

00:01:59.069 --> 00:02:04.380
 region 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:06.200
 define auction this very well very well 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.179
 by the server 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:10.429
 and let's put good let's leave it 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:14.480
 priorities I would have to put the 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:20.629
 priority 1 region 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:23.030
 and his robe his robe the auction now there 

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:26.980
 that put it in one and now the next 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:29.080
 poster that is this the joyful command 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:31.450
 beat 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:37.110
 I do not know very well how the 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:37.110
 region that is auction I think it was 

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:40.080
 and says 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:48.660
 a start price we're going to put 100 and 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:50.720
 how long will it end? 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:53.480
 2 days 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:56.870
 and the name of the player I imagine that 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:59.720
 would be if he wants to sell a player and 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:02.630
 As you see, the vine is at auction 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:04.940
 is then you will see here I imagine 

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:07.340
 that has already offered that and if it came to 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:09.710
 another player you see has been offered more 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:11.900
 I offer more and so until I buy it 

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:13.880
 truth is that this plugin is very good 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:17.630
 and see you in the next video that 

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:19.250
 will be with how to create stores and you know 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:23.650
