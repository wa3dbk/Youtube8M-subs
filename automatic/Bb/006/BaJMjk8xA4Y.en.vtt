00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:40.660 
need to do it before I print the part is

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:43.440 
need to do it before I print the part is
you<00:00:40.750> need<00:00:40.899> to<00:00:41.760> orient<00:00:42.760> the<00:00:42.850> part<00:00:43.120> the<00:00:43.270> way<00:00:43.390> you

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:43.450 
you need to orient the part the way you

want it to be printed so I want be
printed<00:00:47.020> standing<00:00:47.320> up<00:00:47.440> so<00:00:47.590> we<00:00:47.650> had<00:00:47.740> to<00:00:47.830> go<00:00:47.950> to

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
printed standing up so we had to go to

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.200 
printed standing up so we had to go to
orientation<00:00:49.920> and<00:00:50.920> I<00:00:51.040> sucked<00:00:51.310> the<00:00:51.460> bottom

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:52.210 
orientation and I sucked the bottom

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:53.250 
orientation and I sucked the bottom
surface<00:00:52.480> over<00:00:52.900> here

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:53.260

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:56.470 
my bottom shirts then click on that then

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:58.650 
my bottom shirts then click on that then
it'll<00:00:56.620> make<00:00:56.739> it<00:00:56.920> stand<00:00:57.579> up<00:00:57.730> printing<00:00:58.239> stand<00:00:58.570> it

00:00:58.650 --> 00:00:58.660 
it'll make it stand up printing stand it

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:02.750 
it'll make it stand up printing stand it
up<00:00:58.780> as<00:00:59.470> you<00:00:59.560> can<00:00:59.650> see<00:00:59.860> there<00:01:00.360> zoom<00:01:01.360> back<00:01:01.570> in

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
I'm gonna head back to orientation then

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:35.330 
I'm gonna head back to orientation then
I<00:01:29.850> had<00:01:30.390> to<00:01:30.630> pack<00:01:31.250> now<00:01:32.250> pack<00:01:33.260> is<00:01:34.260> a<00:01:34.440> pack<00:01:35.310> of

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
I had to pack now pack is a pack of

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.270 
I had to pack now pack is a pack of
parts<00:01:35.820> say<00:01:36.480> I<00:01:36.510> want<00:01:36.720> to<00:01:36.780> print<00:01:37.130> three<00:01:38.130> these

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
parts say I want to print three these

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.090 
parts say I want to print three these
cups<00:01:39.170> those<00:01:40.170> three<00:01:40.350> cups<00:01:40.590> will<00:01:40.710> be<00:01:40.800> the<00:01:40.890> pack

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
cups those three cups will be the pack

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.590 
cups those three cups will be the pack
so<00:01:41.670> I'll<00:01:41.790> go<00:01:41.880> into<00:01:42.030> packs<00:01:42.300> tab<00:01:42.690> over<00:01:42.930> here<00:01:44.600> now

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
so I'll go into packs tab over here now

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.219 
so I'll go into packs tab over here now
these<00:01:45.810> four<00:01:46.470> squares<00:01:47.750> represent<00:01:48.750> the<00:01:48.870> bottom

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
these four squares represent the bottom

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:55.969 
these four squares represent the bottom
plane<00:01:49.790> of<00:01:50.790> the<00:01:51.600> model<00:01:52.229> base<00:01:53.570> each<00:01:54.570> one<00:01:54.840> is<00:01:55.050> 2

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
plane of the model base each one is 2

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:59.240 
plane of the model base each one is 2
inches<00:01:56.250> by<00:01:56.460> 2<00:01:56.490> inches<00:01:56.870> so<00:01:57.870> it's<00:01:58.050> 8<00:01:58.320> inches<00:01:58.620> by<00:01:59.100> 8

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
inches by 2 inches so it's 8 inches by 8

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.730 
inches by 2 inches so it's 8 inches by 8
inches<00:01:59.510> that's<00:02:00.510> how<00:02:00.750> small<00:02:00.990> the<00:02:01.110> cup<00:02:01.290> is<00:02:01.440> there

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
inches that's how small the cup is there

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.950 
inches that's how small the cup is there
I<00:02:01.920> can<00:02:02.820> click<00:02:02.940> on<00:02:03.060> this<00:02:03.180> Cup<00:02:03.390> and<00:02:03.570> drag<00:02:03.780> it

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
I can click on this Cup and drag it

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.370 
I can click on this Cup and drag it
anywhere<00:02:05.150> I<00:02:06.150> want<00:02:06.750> to<00:02:06.840> build<00:02:06.990> and<00:02:07.140> I<00:02:07.170> want<00:02:07.320> to

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
anywhere I want to build and I want to

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.040 
anywhere I want to build and I want to
build<00:02:07.470> it<00:02:07.560> over<00:02:07.619> here<00:02:08.179> over<00:02:09.179> here<00:02:09.330> over<00:02:09.540> here

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
build it over here over here over here

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:11.870 
build it over here over here over here
and<00:02:10.170> this<00:02:10.560> corner<00:02:10.950> is<00:02:11.040> always<00:02:11.310> the<00:02:11.430> fastest

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:11.880 
and this corner is always the fastest

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:13.400 
and this corner is always the fastest
because<00:02:12.030> that's<00:02:12.330> where<00:02:12.540> the<00:02:12.690> Machine<00:02:13.140> machine

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
because that's where the Machine machine

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:19.699 
because that's where the Machine machine
homes<00:02:16.820> and<00:02:17.959> over<00:02:18.959> here<00:02:19.110> doesn't<00:02:19.410> tell<00:02:19.530> me<00:02:19.560> how

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:19.709 
homes and over here doesn't tell me how

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:22.190 
homes and over here doesn't tell me how
long<00:02:19.860> it<00:02:19.980> needs<00:02:20.010> to<00:02:20.220> take<00:02:20.400> to<00:02:20.520> build<00:02:21.050> how<00:02:22.050> much

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
long it needs to take to build how much

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:25.160 
long it needs to take to build how much
material<00:02:22.680> will<00:02:22.800> take<00:02:23.510> and<00:02:24.510> the<00:02:24.810> name<00:02:24.989> of<00:02:25.080> the

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
material will take and the name of the

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:29.690 
material will take and the name of the
file<00:02:26.060> now<00:02:27.060> I<00:02:27.090> want<00:02:27.510> to<00:02:27.540> print<00:02:27.780> it<00:02:27.870> so<00:02:28.830> go<00:02:29.670> over

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
file now I want to print it so go over

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.720 
file now I want to print it so go over
here<00:02:29.910> to<00:02:29.970> print
