00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
one thing it's a good-looking smart

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.320 
one thing it's a good-looking smart
phone<00:00:22.050> it's<00:00:22.410> nice<00:00:22.830> thin<00:00:23.279> and<00:00:23.519> lightweight<00:00:23.789> I

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
phone it's nice thin and lightweight I

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.960 
phone it's nice thin and lightweight I
do<00:00:24.750> miss<00:00:25.109> a<00:00:25.140> soft<00:00:25.890> touch<00:00:26.099> finish<00:00:26.369> since<00:00:26.849> I

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
do miss a soft touch finish since I

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:28.519 
do miss a soft touch finish since I
think<00:00:27.180> it<00:00:27.300> gives<00:00:27.390> the<00:00:27.599> phone<00:00:27.750> a<00:00:27.779> nice<00:00:28.080> texture

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
think it gives the phone a nice texture

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.230 
think it gives the phone a nice texture
but<00:00:28.890> that's<00:00:29.039> just<00:00:29.220> a<00:00:29.340> minor<00:00:29.550> complaint<00:00:30.000> on

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
but that's just a minor complaint on

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.060 
but that's just a minor complaint on
front<00:00:31.230> you've<00:00:31.529> got<00:00:31.769> a<00:00:31.800> 4<00:00:32.219> inch<00:00:32.460> qhd<00:00:33.420> display

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:34.070 
front you've got a 4 inch qhd display

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:36.770 
front you've got a 4 inch qhd display
qhd<00:00:35.070> means<00:00:35.280> quarter<00:00:35.640> HD<00:00:36.059> so<00:00:36.329> you're<00:00:36.450> getting<00:00:36.570> a

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
qhd means quarter HD so you're getting a

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.190 
qhd means quarter HD so you're getting a
real<00:00:36.960> sharp<00:00:37.370> 960<00:00:38.370> x<00:00:38.520> 540<00:00:39.210> pixel<00:00:39.690> resolution

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
real sharp 960 x 540 pixel resolution

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.770 
real sharp 960 x 540 pixel resolution
here<00:00:40.379> it's<00:00:41.040> beautiful<00:00:41.219> and<00:00:41.610> bright<00:00:41.820> I'd<00:00:42.570> say

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
here it's beautiful and bright I'd say

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.420 
here it's beautiful and bright I'd say
it's<00:00:42.930> on<00:00:43.050> par<00:00:43.320> with<00:00:43.379> the<00:00:43.590> iphones<00:00:44.070> retina

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
it's on par with the iphones retina

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.369 
it's on par with the iphones retina
display<00:00:44.850> but<00:00:45.450> since<00:00:45.629> the<00:00:45.780> atrix<00:00:46.200> has<00:00:46.350> a

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
display but since the atrix has a

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.410 
display but since the atrix has a
slightly<00:00:46.680> bigger<00:00:46.920> screen<00:00:47.340> the<00:00:47.670> pixel<00:00:48.000> density

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
slightly bigger screen the pixel density

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.510 
slightly bigger screen the pixel density
isn't<00:00:48.629> as<00:00:48.899> great<00:00:49.079> so<00:00:49.440> text<00:00:49.800> and<00:00:49.920> images<00:00:50.250> aren't

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
isn't as great so text and images aren't

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.369 
isn't as great so text and images aren't
quite<00:00:50.910> as<00:00:50.940> smooth<00:00:51.390> as<00:00:51.600> they<00:00:51.719> are<00:00:51.930> on<00:00:52.199> the

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
quite as smooth as they are on the

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:55.430 
quite as smooth as they are on the
iPhone<00:00:53.210> one<00:00:54.210> other<00:00:54.449> design<00:00:54.840> feature<00:00:55.079> i<00:00:55.170> wanted

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
iPhone one other design feature i wanted

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.049 
iPhone one other design feature i wanted
to<00:00:55.559> point<00:00:55.710> out<00:00:55.920> before<00:00:56.250> moving<00:00:56.489> on<00:00:56.640> is<00:00:56.879> the

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
to point out before moving on is the

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:58.970 
to point out before moving on is the
power<00:00:57.239> button<00:00:57.449> here<00:00:57.750> on<00:00:57.780> back<00:00:58.050> this<00:00:58.710> actually

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
power button here on back this actually

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.099 
power button here on back this actually
doubles<00:00:59.550> as<00:00:59.760> a<00:00:59.789> fingerprint<00:01:00.359> scanner<00:01:00.690> so<00:01:01.020> if

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
doubles as a fingerprint scanner so if

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.080 
doubles as a fingerprint scanner so if
you<00:01:01.260> want<00:01:01.440> some<00:01:01.620> added<00:01:01.949> security<00:01:02.309> you<00:01:02.760> can<00:01:02.969> go

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
you want some added security you can go

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:04.850 
you want some added security you can go
into<00:01:03.270> the<00:01:03.420> settings<00:01:03.629> menu<00:01:03.870> and<00:01:04.350> register<00:01:04.739> your

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
into the settings menu and register your

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.710 
into the settings menu and register your
fingerprint<00:01:05.369> along<00:01:05.909> with<00:01:06.060> the<00:01:06.150> pin<00:01:06.330> number<00:01:06.360> to

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
fingerprint along with the pin number to

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.130 
fingerprint along with the pin number to
add<00:01:07.530> some<00:01:07.890> extra<00:01:08.100> security<00:01:08.460> and<00:01:08.610> phone<00:01:09.140> but

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
add some extra security and phone but

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.810 
add some extra security and phone but
this<00:01:10.260> phone<00:01:10.439> isn't<00:01:10.680> about<00:01:10.979> design<00:01:11.369> it's<00:01:11.670> about

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
this phone isn't about design it's about

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.750 
this phone isn't about design it's about
power<00:01:12.090> and<00:01:12.240> speed<00:01:12.750> the<00:01:13.260> motorola<00:01:13.530> atrix<00:01:13.920> 4g<00:01:14.220> is

one of the first smartphones to feature
a<00:01:16.439> dual-core<00:01:16.979> processor<00:01:17.670> it's<00:01:18.420> equipped<00:01:18.750> with

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
a dual-core processor it's equipped with

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
Nvidia's Tegra 2 chipset and I don't

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:22.789 
Nvidia's Tegra 2 chipset and I don't
want<00:01:21.210> to<00:01:21.270> get<00:01:21.390> too<00:01:21.600> technical<00:01:21.630> here<00:01:22.140> so<00:01:22.680> I'll

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
want to get too technical here so I'll

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:24.050 
want to get too technical here so I'll
just<00:01:22.830> say<00:01:23.040> that<00:01:23.280> having<00:01:23.549> this<00:01:23.759> chipset

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
just say that having this chipset

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.120 
just say that having this chipset
improves<00:01:24.659> overall<00:01:25.049> performance<00:01:25.530> of<00:01:25.860> the
