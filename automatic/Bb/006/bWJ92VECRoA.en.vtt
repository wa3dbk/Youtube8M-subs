aaliyah's perm rods that video and she

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.130 
aaliyah's perm rods that video and she
did<00:00:47.909> this<00:00:47.969> perm<00:00:48.210> rod<00:00:48.390> set<00:00:48.629> like<00:00:48.839> a<00:00:48.870> while<00:00:49.109> ago

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
did this perm rod set like a while ago

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.930 
did this perm rod set like a while ago
not<00:00:49.920> too<00:00:50.039> long<00:00:50.159> ago<00:00:50.219> but<00:00:50.550> she<00:00:50.640> did<00:00:50.760> it<00:00:50.850> awhile

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
not too long ago but she did it awhile

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.599 
not too long ago but she did it awhile
ago<00:00:51.089> and<00:00:51.539> i<00:00:52.289> really<00:00:52.620> like<00:00:52.769> those<00:00:52.920> curls<00:00:53.370> so<00:00:53.550> i

00:00:53.599 --> 00:00:53.609 
ago and i really like those curls so i

00:00:53.609 --> 00:00:57.229 
ago and i really like those curls so i
figured<00:00:53.969> i<00:00:54.710> would<00:00:55.710> have<00:00:55.829> to<00:00:55.859> get<00:00:56.100> a<00:00:56.249> new<00:00:56.309> set<00:00:57.089> of

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
figured i would have to get a new set of

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:00.709 
figured i would have to get a new set of
curls<00:00:57.600> to<00:00:57.809> achieve<00:00:58.199> that<00:00:58.440> tight<00:00:58.739> curl<00:00:59.579> look<00:00:59.909> so

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
curls to achieve that tight curl look so

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:04.580 
curls to achieve that tight curl look so
i<00:01:00.749> ended<00:01:01.229> up<00:01:01.379> buying<00:01:02.089> this<00:01:03.089> size<00:01:03.479> as<00:01:03.839> opposed

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:04.590 
i ended up buying this size as opposed

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:08.230 
i ended up buying this size as opposed
to<00:01:05.030> this<00:01:06.030> size<00:01:06.540> that<00:01:06.930> i've<00:01:07.020> already<00:01:07.230> had<00:01:07.620> and

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:08.240 
to this size that i've already had and

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:13.400 
to this size that i've already had and
so<00:01:10.700> so<00:01:11.700> this<00:01:12.060> one<00:01:12.330> produced<00:01:12.690> that<00:01:12.900> tighter

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:13.410 
so so this one produced that tighter

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:15.800 
so so this one produced that tighter
curl<00:01:13.950> that<00:01:14.160> i<00:01:14.250> was<00:01:14.370> looking<00:01:14.580> for<00:01:14.610> so<00:01:15.510> that<00:01:15.690> the

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
curl that i was looking for so that the

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.710 
curl that i was looking for so that the
curls<00:01:16.050> the<00:01:16.200> last<00:01:16.410> a<00:01:16.590> long<00:01:16.770> time<00:01:17.540> because<00:01:18.540> i'm

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
curls the last a long time because i'm

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.610 
curls the last a long time because i'm
planning<00:01:18.990> on<00:01:19.020> doing<00:01:19.290> much<00:01:19.800> to<00:01:20.010> it<00:01:21.230> so<00:01:22.230> i<00:01:22.260> ended

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:22.620 
planning on doing much to it so i ended

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:27.200 
planning on doing much to it so i ended
up<00:01:22.740> curling<00:01:23.040> my<00:01:23.160> hair<00:01:23.420> with<00:01:24.420> that<00:01:25.850> all<00:01:26.850> across

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.890 
one two three four five I was flat
twists<00:01:37.130> going<00:01:38.130> like<00:01:38.580> in<00:01:38.790> this<00:01:38.970> side<00:01:39.270> and<00:01:39.630> then

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
twists going like in this side and then

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:43.040 
twists going like in this side and then
I<00:01:40.020> left<00:01:40.200> these<00:01:40.410> out<00:01:41.150> so<00:01:42.150> um<00:01:42.510> that's<00:01:42.810> pretty

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:43.050 
I left these out so um that's pretty

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:46.580 
I left these out so um that's pretty
much<00:01:43.140> what<00:01:43.320> I<00:01:43.350> used<00:01:43.890> um<00:01:44.690> to<00:01:45.690> achieve<00:01:46.350> this

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
much what I used um to achieve this

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.690 
much what I used um to achieve this
style<00:01:47.040> I<00:01:47.720> used<00:01:48.720> was<00:01:49.020> the<00:01:49.230> perm<00:01:49.530> rods<00:01:49.890> and<00:01:50.280> then

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
style I used was the perm rods and then

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:56.390 
style I used was the perm rods and then
I<00:01:51.410> used<00:01:52.410> I<00:01:53.070> think<00:01:54.000> it<00:01:54.090> was<00:01:54.210> the<00:01:54.360> motions<00:01:55.400> style

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:56.400

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:01.370 
I used I think it was the motions style
and<00:01:56.760> set<00:01:57.090> hold<00:01:57.720> mousse<00:01:59.150> but<00:02:00.150> I've<00:02:00.750> also<00:02:01.230> used

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
this one too I don't have the motions to

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.860 
this one too I don't have the motions to
show<00:02:04.710> but<00:02:05.340> I've<00:02:05.430> also<00:02:05.640> used<00:02:05.820> this<00:02:06.210> one<00:02:06.450> so<00:02:06.690> this

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:06.870

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
this because at the time I thought my

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.050 
this because at the time I thought my
hair<00:02:22.320> was<00:02:22.350> too<00:02:22.560> short<00:02:22.709> to<00:02:22.890> do<00:02:23.010> much<00:02:23.610> of

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
hair was too short to do much of

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:25.699 
hair was too short to do much of
anything<00:02:24.510> and<00:02:24.990> I<00:02:25.080> didn't<00:02:25.290> like<00:02:25.350> how<00:02:25.500> nothing

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:25.709

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:31.770 
um so I just held on to this and until I

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:33.800 
um so I just held on to this and until I
saw<00:02:31.920> her<00:02:32.070> video<00:02:32.400> but<00:02:32.760> oh<00:02:32.940> I<00:02:33.209> have<00:02:33.450> one<00:02:33.480> of<00:02:33.720> these

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:37.880 
let me use this so I used it for my perm
rod<00:02:35.910> set<00:02:36.180> I<00:02:36.360> didn't<00:02:36.840> use<00:02:36.959> it<00:02:36.990> for<00:02:37.260> this<00:02:37.410> one<00:02:37.680> but

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
rod set I didn't use it for this one but

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:41.140 
rod set I didn't use it for this one but
I<00:02:37.950> did<00:02:38.250> one<00:02:38.430> previously<00:02:38.970> and<00:02:39.270> it<00:02:39.360> works

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:41.150 
I did one previously and it works

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:43.670 
I did one previously and it works
they're<00:02:42.150> really<00:02:42.239> good<00:02:42.540> um<00:02:42.930> it<00:02:43.200> works<00:02:43.380> just<00:02:43.470> as

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
they're really good um it works just as

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.550 
they're really good um it works just as
fine<00:02:43.739> as<00:02:44.160> the<00:02:44.280> motions<00:02:44.640> I<00:02:44.910> didn't<00:02:45.330> I<00:02:45.560> didn't

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
fine as the motions I didn't I didn't

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.630 
fine as the motions I didn't I didn't
really<00:02:46.650> see<00:02:46.739> that<00:02:46.920> much<00:02:46.980> of<00:02:47.070> a<00:02:47.220> difference<00:02:47.250> but

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:49.640 
really see that much of a difference but

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:52.580 
really see that much of a difference but
if<00:02:50.640> you<00:02:50.760> already<00:02:50.910> have<00:02:51.150> this<00:02:51.360> use<00:02:51.600> it<00:02:51.810> it<00:02:52.050> does

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
if you already have this use it it does

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:54.920 
if you already have this use it it does
work<00:02:52.830> and<00:02:53.010> it<00:02:53.340> gives<00:02:54.120> a<00:02:54.180> better<00:02:54.300> hold<00:02:54.570> to<00:02:54.780> me

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
work and it gives a better hold to me

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:59.509 
work and it gives a better hold to me
than<00:02:55.110> just<00:02:55.550> regular<00:02:56.750> water<00:02:57.750> I<00:02:58.020> think<00:02:58.410> cuz<00:02:58.650> with

than just regular water I think cuz with
water<00:02:59.820> might<00:03:00.150> would<00:03:00.330> have<00:03:02.120> fallen<00:03:03.120> a<00:03:03.540> long

00:03:04.009 --> 00:03:04.019 
water might would have fallen a long

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:06.280 
water might would have fallen a long
