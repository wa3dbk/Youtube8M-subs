00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:05.029
 hello friends today we are going to prepare a 

00:00:02.390 --> 00:00:07.729
 Typical Peruvian dessert that is called 

00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:09.110
 I sigh to the Lima well we need the 

00:00:07.729 --> 00:00:11.150
 following ingredients that would come out more 

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:12.500
 or less about six glasses well we have 

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:14.419
 our ingredients and our 

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:16.910
 prepared utensils we will put in a 

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:18.880
 pot to heat and we will put what is 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:22.810
 evaporated milk 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:25.029
 followed by condensed milk 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:27.599
 and then the three teaspoons of 

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:29.890
 vanilla that has to be liquid 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.750
 we will remove a little bit to mix the 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:35.489
 ingredients and then the half dram of 

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:38.920
 port wine and we will continue stirring 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:42.070
 while that heats up we'll put in a 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:44.110
 saucepan with water to boil to make the 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:47.940
 next step always stirring 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:47.940
 we will separate the whites from the yolks 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:56.300
 and we will remove a little to mix and 

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:59.030
 break what is the yolk once you are 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:00.880
 hot water we will put the buds to 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:03.440
 bain- marie to make them a little 

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:06.260
 dissolve them a little bit and they adapt 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:08.150
 a little to the temperature as you see is 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:11.930
 liquid that means that it is already 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:15.890
 suitable to mix it we will put it together 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:18.920
 with milk and vanilla and port and 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:21.500
 we will continue stirring and now you have to 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:26.210
 throw a good time stirring for 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:27.979
 that you see that this begins to take shape and is 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:29.990
 always on medium heat and always 

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:32.830
 removing that you do not forget so that 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:35.450
 do not burn once it's enough 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:36.979
 We will change it from the source and 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:40.009
 we will cover it with a fill 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:41.540
 transparent so it does not create a crust 

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:44.840
 above and we'll put it in the fridge 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:46.920
 to cool once it is already cold 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:50.810
 we will serve it 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:54.090
 we will put a few glasses that is to say that 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:56.700
 possibly not the typical Peruvian I 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:59.220
 six glasses have come out as you see now 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:01.530
 with the clear ones what we are going to do is 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:03.780
 mount the whites to the point of snow and a 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:06.720
 Once it is already frothy we will put the 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:09.509
 sugar the three tablespoons of sugar and 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:11.819
 that is 5 minutes beating will be 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:14.400
 pretty fixed when you see it is 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:16.620
 and durito is that it is ready 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:19.769
 we will put in the pastry bag with a 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:22.709
 wide mouthpiece so that to decorate it and 

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:26.280
 that is very well we will put in the sleeve 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:28.830
 and then we'll close the sleeve and let's go 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:30.690
 squeezing very slowly from above 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:34.850
 down to fill what is 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:38.400
 it stays and it is already and it is to do dots of 

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:40.049
 merengue and it's that simple 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:42.330
 I decorated with a little cinnamon 

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:42.900
 so that it is like that a little bit of color and 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:44.489
 It is done 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:46.950
 You have to try it because it's your typical 

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:50.610
 Peruvian dessert that is very good as well 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:52.650
