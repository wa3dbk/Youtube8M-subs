00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:09.290
 yummy if you want to make a mayonnaise 

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:12.200
 you are afraid that it will cut 

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:16.180
 that we leave because I'm going to prepare a 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:16.180
 that comes out yes or yes 

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:27.829
 sunflower oil two eggs 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:30.050
 droplets of lemon and a pinch of salt the 

00:00:27.829 --> 00:00:31.489
 oil if you want to give it more flavor that 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:33.949
 depends on the taste you can use 

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:36.620
 also extra virgin olive oil 

00:00:33.949 --> 00:00:39.739
 we have a glass of normal blender in 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:41.770
 all the houses we add first the 

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:44.310
 eggs 

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:44.310
 do not 

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:49.810
 and two the eggs have to be at the 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:51.610
 same temperature as the oil ones 

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:53.020
 warm eggs or take it out half an hour 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:56.140
 before the fridge to do the 

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:59.620
 mayonnaise that as you see we have 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:04.530
 the low egg we add the oil well with 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:07.200
 cuidadito suddenly see well 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.970
 and a few drops of lemon if we like the 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.250
 You can make citrus lemon 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.330
 with a little bit of vinegar a pinch of 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:16.440
 Salt 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:20.490
 and the blender we put it to the ass 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:23.150
 the vessel there without moving the still, 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.150
 we started to beat 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:30.030
 without separating 

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:32.909
 the photo 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:37.469
 we started to move up and to 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.469
 down 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:53.630
 We would try to see if it's good salt 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:56.659
 It was very good once installed and already 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:59.090
 we have homemade mayonnaise sauce another day 

00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:01.189
 I will explain how to make it without egg for 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:02.960
 those who have allergies to this 

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:06.020
 product 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:07.549
 we add eggs first eggs 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:11.300
 they have to be at the same temperature 

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:13.550
 that the oil we add the oil well with 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:16.160
 careful and a few drops of lemon a 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:20.600
 pinch of salt and the blender never makes 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:23.300
 for the blender of the ass of the glass up 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:26.270
 that starts emulsifying good here the 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:27.980
 you have a super creamy cream that like 

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:30.500
 all the preparations that in which 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:33.500
 we use raw fire should go to the 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:38.230
 fridge we avoid salmonellosis that is so 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:42.140
 typical in many places in summer like 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:44.390
 and of course you will be out of 10 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:46.700
 points and the first one another bit of 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:48.010
