00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:16.910
 We like to have a look with our Camara guide 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:20.050
 We are here in Hamburg in a disco 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:22.929
 the only evening event 

00:00:22.929 --> 00:00:25.970
 Party and the dwarves in the league connects 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:28.669
 You have to say we are you before the actual opening time 

00:00:28.669 --> 00:00:32.449
 there it would be the real traffic diversion so the event 

00:00:32.449 --> 00:00:34.230
 is very popular 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.390
 Here you can also see who supports this event 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:39.740
 "That's all in the past and name

 this record and the love of Bastian 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:47.770
 so and he becomes and that you give us a logical and if it was so good at that time - 

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:50.229
 but I would say she continued 

00:00:50.229 --> 00:00:53.769
 yes we are always a flop in Hamburg that it's the dance floors 

00:00:53.769 --> 00:00:57.549

 Linde and fun driving pleasure what it took the river of the year took the 

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:06.220
 Miserable of Normandy, there we need migrant workers as Darius altogether 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:10.110
 good Sunder international cameraman so da national cadre leadership 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.330

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:15.500
 what's going on the internet 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:19.530
 I'm in favor of having to be tough on people, but more and more you have to 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:20.290
 admit 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:24.060
 he looked immense Helpers gave especially Henderson 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.200
 No they did not need these we would have to change 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.549
 in a first summary of its members 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:30.800
 Pauli and comprehensive 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:32.680

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:41.640
 Hosts know the effeff 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.820
 but we fall into disrepair No it's a volunteer's way or Zara's heard 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.280
 Wesertal II wants that's not good 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:52.630
 because thus as well as ordinary since also an end of the event becomes 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:54.850
 So everybody is active on the internet or 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:57.830

 just run and stuff like that 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:11.290
 First of all the location is a bit of a hiccup. Maybe you have one 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:13.959
 something similar seen by the Brussels on 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:17.650

 the club of the city 

00:03:29.279 --> 00:03:31.929
 If so, then the first trip was the Dutchman 

00:03:31.929 --> 00:03:35.379
