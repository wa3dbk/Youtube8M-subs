00:00:00.569 --> 00:00:02.830
 denise - living room 6 

00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:04.550
 but if evil about 

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:05.759
 best set 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:08.009
 and overshadowed 

00:00:08.009 --> 00:00:10.389
 so nothing 

00:00:10.389 --> 00:00:13.999
 if you do not understand much so if he even had you do a lot 

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:15.049
 with them 

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:17.869
 but are also very simple to use 

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:20.529
 so I'll start here by drawing and painting 

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:23.529
 Here's a myth about a semicolon six 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:28.029
 I'm going to draw too. 

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:30.939
 two lines 

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:33.939
 just for us to test some options of craft is to test 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.470
 also do some others 

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:41.470
 random squares 

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:46.720
 So you think he does? 

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:49.010
 it from two objects 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:51.100
 in any case two lines 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:54.920
 if your using ct will do what he would repeat are mine 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.260
 so much inside out 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.530
 themselves 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:02.440
 if you do here in that 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:04.790
 then he will repeat the four 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:06.680
 air lines 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:10.030
 so much buying power out so let's go 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:13.030
 without injuring anything I vote I will use ct 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.030
 all be difficult to get close to the profiles apply 

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:20.250
 I can not put it inside. 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.060
 not out 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:23.490
 I'm crazy 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:24.880
 put in here 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:26.420
 little shame kings 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:28.719
 draining is a medical wall 15 

00:01:28.719 --> 00:01:32.110
 centimeters 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:33.240
 cool 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.850
 then the hour and already did what he parted 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.850
 on the surface already induces 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:41.210
 if you want to do 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:42.310
 what cq 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:43.610
 in these two lines 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:46.600
 Please note you can not 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:50.010
 you will only get it if you select them before 

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:51.480
 I selected 

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:54.480
 photo 7 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:57.060
 cool, right? 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.079
 I wish that no line you can not or not 

00:02:00.079 --> 00:02:01.980
 leaves no option 

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:05.469
 as you do this if you want a mini museum use or fine 

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:08.069
 Leah movie with coconut 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:09.149
 Hey you 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:10.849
 can move 

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:12.499
 I'll do it here, too. 

00:02:12.499 --> 00:02:15.499
 then dispose of the apparatus to the mold 

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:19.019
 I took the team 

00:02:20.309 --> 00:02:22.379
 and the macaé in this test 

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:24.359
 note here 

00:02:24.359 --> 00:02:27.359
 deic rossetto it stores information 

00:02:28.159 --> 00:02:30.619
 so if I use ctb two clicks 

00:02:30.619 --> 00:02:32.879
 in october local 

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:34.569
 and will repeat 

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:36.429
 the last die 

00:02:36.429 --> 00:02:37.939
 I'm going because it did not work. 

00:02:37.939 --> 00:02:40.619
 I stayed stopped but at last 

00:02:40.619 --> 00:02:42.889
 tiger always repeats 

00:02:42.889 --> 00:02:44.759
 the last one you date 

00:02:44.759 --> 00:02:46.979
 - three here 

00:02:46.979 --> 00:02:49.979
 and so on 

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:54.489
 hulk or burial in if recurring feature 

00:02:55.129 --> 00:02:57.969
 nice, then to the tst 

00:02:57.969 --> 00:03:00.839
 and it's very simple to use and it only really has 

00:03:00.839 --> 00:03:02.309
 this course 

00:03:02.309 --> 00:03:04.349
 from you 

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:06.129
 copy visitors 

00:03:06.129 --> 00:03:09.129
 out the purchase inside the object is 

00:03:11.579 --> 00:03:14.579
 so we're going to go get pigs now 

00:03:16.469 --> 00:03:19.749
 he as well as seven has taken care of the selected before or after 

00:03:21.309 --> 00:03:24.469
 remembering that this pre-selection course of the 

00:03:24.469 --> 00:03:27.779
 stayed there only has this version 8 92 and I have not had 

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:32.209
 I do not know if it harms anything. 

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:34.409
 if I put my feet tight 

00:03:34.409 --> 00:03:35.619
 physically 

00:03:35.619 --> 00:03:37.569
 cliff nothing at all 

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:39.369
 and I'll give you a kit 

00:03:39.369 --> 00:03:42.469
 the emtu that happened whose audience is for you to make a good mood 

00:03:46.259 --> 00:03:47.910
 It's difficult, so I clicked. 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:49.829
 yes, I'll tell him 

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:51.839
 buffon dana to avoid yes 

00:03:51.839 --> 00:03:54.839
 to work 

00:03:55.669 --> 00:03:58.269
 the case wishes paquito fazendão 

00:03:58.269 --> 00:03:59.869
 these moments 

00:03:59.869 --> 00:04:02.979
 I told you about it and type three and it's not internal. 

00:04:03.919 --> 00:04:05.319
 they said that he 

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:08.779
 pulled all those profiles up 

00:04:08.779 --> 00:04:10.959
 on the court 

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:13.059
 so it also has access 

00:04:13.059 --> 00:04:15.759
 it's garnished I promote crowded 

00:04:15.759 --> 00:04:18.759
 that the z then only given explanation 

00:04:19.809 --> 00:04:22.809
 all objects at the same height 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:26.539
 We did not count here to show a 

00:04:26.539 --> 00:04:28.389
 another important thing 

00:04:28.389 --> 00:04:31.389
 in these I remember two beaver from the scene profiles 

00:04:32.229 --> 00:04:33.990
 so you 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:36.900
 right-click on the profiles if you revert 

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:39.900
 he got charged up, huh? 

00:04:40.659 --> 00:04:42.210
 that is what happened 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:45.629
 it was positive here the two went up 

00:04:45.629 --> 00:04:48.629
 and that's where it goes down 

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:52.400
 so that's why it's important to work with the FARC 

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:53.310
 always focused 

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:56.789
 same place 

00:04:56.789 --> 00:04:58.830
 Now yes 

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:01.830
 khanna 

00:05:02.569 --> 00:05:03.999
 tec 

00:05:03.999 --> 00:05:05.879
 To believe that no 

00:05:05.879 --> 00:05:08.879
 the dry weather and the next to the injured and travelers 

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:13.449
 I click on the landing well I'll be able to take the course because she 

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:16.069
 when you click 

00:05:16.069 --> 00:05:19.069
 that selection in marriage 

00:05:19.669 --> 00:05:22.089
 but you have how to disable 

00:05:22.089 --> 00:05:24.639
 in this function 

00:05:24.639 --> 00:05:27.919
 he is lucky 

00:05:27.919 --> 00:05:30.370
 abilone hindu 

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:32.539
 Do you have that young man in the 

00:05:32.539 --> 00:05:34.810
 note that these two new options 

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:36.809
 are from tav site that eight 

00:05:36.809 --> 00:05:39.809
 for me to disable the mayor is not 

00:05:41.349 --> 00:05:44.349
 I did not vote then right now selecting before 

00:05:45.319 --> 00:05:48.419
 pick up anywhere 

00:05:48.419 --> 00:05:52.089
 and another very cool tool to read here. 

00:05:52.089 --> 00:05:53.779
 in prose 

00:05:53.779 --> 00:05:54.620
 which is what 

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:57.819
 I help you in your guidance in the rodeo of winning 

00:05:57.819 --> 00:05:59.050
 if I take the line 

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:00.800
 seeing that he makes a 

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:02.580
 simulation of axes here 

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:05.860
 so it gets much easier you think the lines are better 

00:06:06.389 --> 00:06:07.939
 assad orbit 

00:06:07.939 --> 00:06:10.059
 it gets much easier 

00:06:10.059 --> 00:06:12.199
 very cool 

00:06:12.199 --> 00:06:14.050
 And then you come the line. 

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:16.379
 and she continues to draw 

00:06:16.379 --> 00:06:19.379
 you can also say enable this option here at 

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:21.389
 preferences 

00:06:21.389 --> 00:06:23.520
 still slowly 

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:25.289
 military success 

00:06:25.289 --> 00:06:27.550
 when you make a line 

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:30.550
 He does not continue anymore 

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:34.919
 so to end alla ibope there is no example 

00:06:34.919 --> 00:06:36.550
 here d 

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:38.520
 already the skeptic bury 

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:40.059
 I'll paint it 7 

00:06:40.059 --> 00:06:43.159
 on this wall here you ride a one trough 

00:06:45.719 --> 00:06:47.949
 two options 

00:06:47.949 --> 00:06:50.909
 What I do there was not drunk, right? 

00:06:50.909 --> 00:06:52.020
 profiles 

00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:53.509
 please delete her 

00:06:53.509 --> 00:06:56.789
 even so no 

00:06:56.789 --> 00:06:58.210
 does not work 

00:06:58.210 --> 00:07:01.479
 So let me do this in a year. 

00:07:01.479 --> 00:07:03.259
 I click on the surface 

00:07:03.259 --> 00:07:05.389
 just got stuck 

00:07:05.389 --> 00:07:06.580
 and notes 

00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:07.520
 when it arrived 

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:08.430
 next 

00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:11.909
 founded it appears a 

00:07:11.909 --> 00:07:13.979
 keita wind if I stay 

00:07:13.979 --> 00:07:14.960
 it was too much 

00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:17.520
 delete already 

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:20.330
 if you have trouble finding this is a feat 

00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:22.830
 turn against the little one 

00:07:22.830 --> 00:07:26.289
 if you can refuse the next course you click 

00:07:26.289 --> 00:07:29.300
 and you go in the line here on the last line that there are 

00:07:30.379 --> 00:07:31.960
 Where is it to go neither red 

00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:33.999
 and you click 

00:07:33.999 --> 00:07:37.289
 got that part here and pulled the 3 

00:07:37.289 --> 00:07:39.379
 eliminating here doing 

00:07:39.379 --> 00:07:41.930
 the hole 

00:07:41.930 --> 00:07:43.309
 So I went to class
