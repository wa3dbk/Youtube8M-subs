00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.160 
silver bronze your iron you qualify an
iron<00:02:02.640> or<00:02:02.759> bronze<00:02:02.909> I<00:02:03.270> probably<00:02:03.899> would

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
iron or bronze I probably would

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:05.420 
iron or bronze I probably would
recommend<00:02:04.560> working<00:02:04.710> on<00:02:04.979> your<00:02:05.130> game<00:02:05.159> a<00:02:05.310> little

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
recommend working on your game a little

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.479 
recommend working on your game a little
more<00:02:06.229> so<00:02:07.229> each<00:02:07.380> divisions<00:02:07.920> broke<00:02:08.160> up<00:02:08.340> into

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
more so each divisions broke up into

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:10.130 
more so each divisions broke up into
about<00:02:08.700> 200<00:02:09.360> players<00:02:09.539> are<00:02:09.810> each<00:02:09.869> subdivision

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
about 200 players are each subdivision

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:11.210 
about 200 players are each subdivision
more<00:02:10.800> or<00:02:10.920> less

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
more or less

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:16.010 
more or less
I<00:02:13.010> don't<00:02:14.010> know<00:02:14.130> what<00:02:14.340> happens<00:02:14.790> if<00:02:15.000> you<00:02:15.180> if<00:02:15.870> you

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.020 
I don't know what happens if you if you

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:18.650 
I don't know what happens if you if you
qualify<00:02:16.320> one<00:02:17.250> let<00:02:17.400> me<00:02:17.430> know<00:02:17.550> please<00:02:17.940> I<00:02:18.180> would

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
qualify one let me know please I would

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:19.850 
qualify one let me know please I would
actually<00:02:18.840> like<00:02:19.110> to<00:02:19.170> notice<00:02:19.470> because<00:02:19.560> I<00:02:19.710> could

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
actually like to notice because I could

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:22.340 
actually like to notice because I could
find<00:02:20.040> anything<00:02:20.340> out<00:02:20.460> she<00:02:21.300> qualified<00:02:21.870> beyond

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:22.350 
find anything out she qualified beyond

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:26.030 
find anything out she qualified beyond
the<00:02:23.130> spectrum<00:02:23.640> of<00:02:23.730> the<00:02:23.850> 200<00:02:24.240> players<00:02:24.980> for<00:02:25.980> each

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
the spectrum of the 200 players for each

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:29.090 
the spectrum of the 200 players for each
subdivision<00:02:26.370> because<00:02:27.090> if<00:02:27.450> you<00:02:28.200> have<00:02:28.350> 2,000

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:29.100 
subdivision because if you have 2,000

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:31.220 
subdivision because if you have 2,000
people<00:02:29.250> playing<00:02:29.640> and<00:02:30.210> you<00:02:30.450> only<00:02:30.570> have<00:02:30.630> six

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
people playing and you only have six

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:33.920 
people playing and you only have six
subdivisions<00:02:32.180> unless<00:02:33.180> I'm<00:02:33.390> really<00:02:33.720> bad<00:02:33.900> at

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
subdivisions unless I'm really bad at

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:36.290 
subdivisions unless I'm really bad at
math<00:02:34.260> it's<00:02:34.440> only<00:02:34.590> 1200<00:02:35.040> players<00:02:35.220> so<00:02:35.490> where<00:02:36.150> the

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:36.300 
math it's only 1200 players so where the

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:38.450 
math it's only 1200 players so where the
800<00:02:36.750> remaining<00:02:37.020> players<00:02:37.440> go<00:02:37.860> I<00:02:37.890> don't<00:02:38.160> know

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:38.460 
800 remaining players go I don't know

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:42.020 
800 remaining players go I don't know
I'll<00:02:39.420> have<00:02:39.600> to<00:02:39.720> find<00:02:39.960> that<00:02:40.050> out<00:02:40.880> but<00:02:41.880> each

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
I'll have to find that out but each

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:44.510 
I'll have to find that out but each
division<00:02:42.360> is<00:02:42.900> is<00:02:43.260> broken<00:02:43.740> up<00:02:43.830> and<00:02:44.130> like<00:02:44.370> I<00:02:44.459> said

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:44.520 
division is is broken up and like I said

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:46.660 
division is is broken up and like I said
in<00:02:44.760> two<00:02:44.850> subdivisions<00:02:45.180> of<00:02:45.510> 200<00:02:45.900> players<00:02:46.050> so

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:46.670 
in two subdivisions of 200 players so

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:50.390 
in two subdivisions of 200 players so
league<00:02:47.670> play<00:02:47.910> extends<00:02:48.630> according<00:02:49.590> the<00:02:50.220> black

calendar days after those season there's

a<00:02:56.760> waiting<00:02:56.970> process<00:02:57.270> which<00:02:57.720> is<00:02:57.870> the<00:02:57.990> preseason

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440 
a waiting process which is the preseason

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:00.530 
a waiting process which is the preseason
during<00:02:59.280> that<00:02:59.400> preseason<00:02:59.820> you<00:03:00.030> can<00:03:00.180> still<00:03:00.420> get

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
during that preseason you can still get

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:02.990 
during that preseason you can still get
in<00:03:00.690> and<00:03:00.870> play<00:03:01.050> you<00:03:01.620> can<00:03:01.800> actually<00:03:02.000> can't

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
in and play you can actually can't

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.390 
in and play you can actually can't
really<00:03:03.270> rank<00:03:03.510> up<00:03:03.750> because<00:03:04.709> once<00:03:04.890> they<00:03:05.010> reset

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
really rank up because once they reset

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.880 
really rank up because once they reset
this<00:03:05.520> season<00:03:05.880> because<00:03:06.500> it<00:03:07.500> will<00:03:07.740> actually

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:07.890 
this season because it will actually

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:10.340 
this season because it will actually
cleave<00:03:08.430> your<00:03:08.550> stats<00:03:08.850> again<00:03:09.050> but<00:03:10.050> during<00:03:10.170> the

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:10.350 
cleave your stats again but during the

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:12.590 
cleave your stats again but during the
preseason<00:03:10.590> what<00:03:11.070> they'll<00:03:11.190> do<00:03:11.370> is<00:03:11.610> they'll

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:12.600 
preseason what they'll do is they'll

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:14.900 
preseason what they'll do is they'll
change<00:03:12.810> map<00:03:13.020> rotations<00:03:13.590> if<00:03:13.910> necessary

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:14.910 
change map rotations if necessary

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:16.940 
change map rotations if necessary
they'll<00:03:15.480> actually<00:03:15.690> change<00:03:16.440> any<00:03:16.590> of<00:03:16.680> the<00:03:16.739> rules

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:16.950 
they'll actually change any of the rules

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:18.979 
they'll actually change any of the rules
that<00:03:17.130> they<00:03:17.220> need<00:03:17.519> be<00:03:17.730> so<00:03:18.269> I<00:03:18.300> guess<00:03:18.570> kind<00:03:18.900> of

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:18.989 
that they need be so I guess kind of

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:22.310 
that they need be so I guess kind of
hone<00:03:19.170> in<00:03:19.440> the<00:03:20.750> the<00:03:21.750> competitive<00:03:22.290> environment

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:22.320 
hone in the the competitive environment

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:27.680 
hone in the the competitive environment
and<00:03:24.830> it<00:03:25.830> allows<00:03:26.100> you<00:03:26.310> to<00:03:26.550> you<00:03:27.269> know<00:03:27.300> get<00:03:27.630> a

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:27.690 
and it allows you to you know get a

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:29.479 
and it allows you to you know get a
little<00:03:27.900> practice<00:03:28.019> in<00:03:28.410> figure<00:03:29.070> out<00:03:29.190> what<00:03:29.340> gun

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:29.489 
little practice in figure out what gun

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:30.710 
little practice in figure out what gun
do<00:03:29.610> you<00:03:29.670> want<00:03:29.820> to<00:03:29.880> use<00:03:30.060> figure<00:03:30.450> out<00:03:30.540> what's

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:30.720 
do you want to use figure out what's

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:44.070 
best with right now the MSMC and the PDW

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:45.410 
best with right now the MSMC and the PDW
are<00:03:44.130> the<00:03:44.250> most<00:03:44.400> used<00:03:44.549> guns<00:03:44.910> gamebattles

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:45.420 
are the most used guns gamebattles

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:47.449 
are the most used guns gamebattles
they're<00:03:46.200> also<00:03:46.320> probably<00:03:46.709> the<00:03:46.830> most<00:03:46.980> used<00:03:47.250> guns

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:47.459 
they're also probably the most used guns

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:51.650 
they're also probably the most used guns
in<00:03:47.640> the<00:03:47.730> game<00:03:48.000> I<00:03:49.010> use<00:03:50.010> two<00:03:50.220> guns<00:03:50.459> I<00:03:50.730> use<00:03:50.940> the<00:03:51.090> PDW

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:51.660 
in the game I use two guns I use the PDW

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:54.080 
in the game I use two guns I use the PDW
and<00:03:51.810> the<00:03:51.870> MSMC<00:03:52.320> both<00:03:52.980> with<00:03:53.220> silencers<00:03:53.700> both

with<00:03:54.299> quick<00:03:54.510> draw<00:03:54.720> I<00:03:54.989> think<00:03:55.470> quick<00:03:55.680> draw<00:03:55.920> is<00:03:56.160> a

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:56.220 
with quick draw I think quick draw is a

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:58.490 
with quick draw I think quick draw is a
must<00:03:56.850> in<00:03:57.120> a<00:03:57.840> competitive<00:03:58.170> gameplay

00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:58.500 
must in a competitive gameplay

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:00.410
