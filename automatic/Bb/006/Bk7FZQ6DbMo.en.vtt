00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
 how about how they are or I'll teach you 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:06.420
 how to hide your last connection in 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:09.179
 whatsapp without it coming out that is 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:11.830
 online typing and that kind of 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:14.139
 annoying you cases 

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:17.200
 the first thing they will need to be to have 

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:18.760
 jailbreak for those who do not know what is 

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:20.410
 the jailbreak is having AIDS and this is 

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:21.970
 good but it involves many cases but not 

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:24.910
 I'm to get into this in these 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:26.800
 moments so we'll need another 

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:27.980
 tweet called flex this that is 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:30.949
 here 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:33.510
 and that is the big repository 

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:36.630
 vast but 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:39.670
 it has a price to say so 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:41.350
 but in other repositories it may be 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:44.290
 free but I recommend that you 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:47.500
 buy now that with it they can create twix 

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:50.350
 it will be like saying it or patches as you want 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:54.580
 tell him and so to start over 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:57.310
 preamble let's go to the application and to 

00:00:54.580 --> 00:01:00.310
 open it we give you a tap in flex 

00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:03.610
 here once inside let's go to the 

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:05.380
 cloud if you are not here we are going to look 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:08.650
 down to whatsapp that those are the 

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:10.540
 that we are installed whatsapp well of 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:14.710
 here we will find many many 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:17.350
 clicks of patches as they want to tell you in 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:19.390
 the various of them do very 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:23.070
 interesting but we 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:23.070
 We focus on having the d 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:28.770
 and invisibly this 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.299
 they tell me they do not know you're online 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.930
 Do not know what you are writing 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.930
 invisible 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:38.940

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:40.950

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:43.680

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:46.850
 flechita if we give in disney 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.850

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:52.650
 well we give it here on the little arrow 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:57.760

00:01:52.650 --> 00:02:01.510
 and we close this we go to whatsapp 

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:04.840

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:06.400
