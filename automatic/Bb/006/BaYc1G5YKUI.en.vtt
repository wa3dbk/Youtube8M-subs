might<00:00:38.020> seem<00:00:38.230> like<00:00:38.260> a<00:00:38.440> good<00:00:38.650> idea<00:00:38.710> at<00:00:39.070> the<00:00:39.190> time

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:39.250 
might seem like a good idea at the time

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:40.380 
might seem like a good idea at the time
and<00:00:39.640> you've<00:00:39.730> probably<00:00:39.910> been<00:00:40.120> a<00:00:40.180> bit

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:40.390 
and you've probably been a bit

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:42.210 
and you've probably been a bit
optimistic<00:00:40.510> but<00:00:41.260> when<00:00:41.710> you<00:00:41.770> actually<00:00:41.890> break

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:42.220 
optimistic but when you actually break

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:44.220 
optimistic but when you actually break
it<00:00:42.460> down<00:00:42.670> and<00:00:42.940> think<00:00:43.210> about<00:00:43.300> it<00:00:43.630> you<00:00:44.140> were

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:44.230 
it down and think about it you were

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:45.420 
it down and think about it you were
probably<00:00:44.470> better<00:00:44.740> off<00:00:44.830> doing<00:00:45.040> what<00:00:45.250> you<00:00:45.340> were

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:45.430 
probably better off doing what you were

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:47.820 
probably better off doing what you were
doing<00:00:45.460> before<00:00:45.670> you<00:00:46.510> know<00:00:46.660> go<00:00:47.320> back<00:00:47.500> to<00:00:47.650> what

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:47.830 
doing before you know go back to what

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:50.880 
doing before you know go back to what

00:01:04.469 --> 00:01:04.479 
battlefield 3 up I've been having

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:06.539 
battlefield 3 up I've been having
software<00:01:04.960> issues<00:01:05.289> as<00:01:05.439> you<00:01:05.740> know<00:01:05.920> my<00:01:06.159> recording

00:01:06.539 --> 00:01:06.549 
software issues as you know my recording

00:01:06.549 --> 00:01:08.730 
software issues as you know my recording
device<00:01:06.789> has<00:01:06.969> been<00:01:07.000> buggy<00:01:07.390> not<00:01:07.689> a<00:01:07.899> knock<00:01:08.590> I

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:08.740 
device has been buggy not a knock I

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:10.349 
device has been buggy not a knock I
think<00:01:09.070> I<00:01:09.130> can<00:01:09.310> probably<00:01:09.429> say<00:01:09.789> that<00:01:09.820> one<00:01:10.149> of<00:01:10.270> the

00:01:10.349 --> 00:01:10.359 
think I can probably say that one of the

00:01:10.359 --> 00:01:12.480 
think I can probably say that one of the
worst<00:01:10.600> games<00:01:10.899> to<00:01:11.170> sit<00:01:11.409> and<00:01:11.530> dissect<00:01:12.189> through

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:12.490 
worst games to sit and dissect through

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:14.639 
worst games to sit and dissect through
and<00:01:12.640> get<00:01:12.820> game<00:01:13.060> plays<00:01:13.329> for<00:01:13.630> he's<00:01:14.079> battlefield

00:01:14.639 --> 00:01:14.649 
and get game plays for he's battlefield

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:16.590 
and get game plays for he's battlefield
3<00:01:14.890> because<00:01:15.219> the<00:01:15.369> maps<00:01:15.579> are<00:01:15.729> so<00:01:15.880> big<00:01:16.240> and<00:01:16.450> it's

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:16.600 
3 because the maps are so big and it's

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:19.289 
3 because the maps are so big and it's
quite<00:01:16.840> slow<00:01:17.170> paced<00:01:17.560> it's<00:01:18.189> enjoyable<00:01:18.670> but<00:01:19.119> it's

00:01:19.289 --> 00:01:19.299 
quite slow paced it's enjoyable but it's

00:01:19.299 --> 00:01:21.270 
quite slow paced it's enjoyable but it's
not<00:01:19.539> like<00:01:19.719> rush<00:01:20.049> rush<00:01:20.289> action<00:01:20.770> bang<00:01:21.009> bang

I've<00:01:35.890> kind<00:01:36.159> of<00:01:36.280> found<00:01:36.520> a<00:01:36.670> way<00:01:36.789> around<00:01:36.819> it<00:01:37.240> you

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:37.420 
I've kind of found a way around it you

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:39.149 
I've kind of found a way around it you
know<00:01:37.569> I've<00:01:37.749> tried<00:01:38.140> and<00:01:38.380> tested<00:01:38.590> that<00:01:38.950> many

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:39.159 
know I've tried and tested that many

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:40.739 
know I've tried and tested that many
different<00:01:39.579> methods<00:01:39.969> and<00:01:40.119> I<00:01:40.179> think<00:01:40.479> I<00:01:40.569> might've

00:01:40.739 --> 00:01:40.749 
different methods and I think I might've

00:01:40.749 --> 00:01:42.569 
different methods and I think I might've
sussed<00:01:41.109> it<00:01:41.229> now<00:01:41.409> hence<00:01:41.799> the<00:01:41.890> reason<00:01:42.130> why<00:01:42.520> you

00:01:42.569 --> 00:01:42.579 
sussed it now hence the reason why you

00:01:42.579 --> 00:01:44.459 
sussed it now hence the reason why you
got<00:01:42.789> two<00:01:42.939> videos<00:01:43.329> yesterday<00:01:43.600> and<00:01:44.049> one<00:01:44.350> that

somebody and I think I emptied half of
my<00:02:28.870> clip<00:02:29.140> of<00:02:29.260> my<00:02:29.410> gun<00:02:29.800> into<00:02:30.100> him<00:02:30.459> and<00:02:30.670> he<00:02:30.880> turned

having it go with that if they're not

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:58.559 
having it go with that if they're not
used<00:02:57.519> to<00:02:57.700> be<00:02:57.760> they're<00:02:58.000> going<00:02:58.090> to<00:02:58.209> find<00:02:58.390> it

00:02:58.559 --> 00:02:58.569 
used to be they're going to find it

00:02:58.569 --> 00:02:59.970 
used to be they're going to find it
completely<00:02:58.810> different<00:02:59.350> because<00:02:59.530> it's<00:02:59.709> faster

00:02:59.970 --> 00:02:59.980 
completely different because it's faster

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:01.920 
completely different because it's faster
paced<00:03:00.430> there's<00:03:00.700> more<00:03:00.880> action<00:03:01.090> but<00:03:01.750> at<00:03:01.840> the

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:01.930 
paced there's more action but at the

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:03.720 
paced there's more action but at the

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:47.360 
close eventually on the fourth game it
