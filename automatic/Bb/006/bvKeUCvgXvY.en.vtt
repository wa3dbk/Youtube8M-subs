I<00:04:03.430> do<00:04:03.849> these<00:04:04.030> little<00:04:04.329> batteries<00:04:04.659> take<00:04:04.840> so<00:04:04.959> long

00:04:05.039 --> 00:04:05.049 
I do these little batteries take so long

00:04:05.049 --> 00:04:06.599 
I do these little batteries take so long
to<00:04:05.200> charge<00:04:05.379> how<00:04:05.680> many<00:04:05.829> hours<00:04:06.069> and<00:04:06.189> 45<00:04:06.579> minutes

oh it's not that it takes so long the

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:11.099 
oh it's not that it takes so long the
charges<00:04:08.739> just<00:04:08.919> they<00:04:09.040> have<00:04:09.159> low<00:04:09.430> uh<00:04:09.870> low<00:04:10.870> and

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:11.109 
charges just they have low uh low and

00:04:11.109 --> 00:04:13.890 
charges just they have low uh low and
chargers<00:04:11.620> you<00:04:12.069> know<00:04:12.220> I<00:04:12.450> you<00:04:13.450> know<00:04:13.480> that<00:04:13.720> kind

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:13.900 
chargers you know I you know that kind

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:17.009 
chargers you know I you know that kind
of<00:04:13.959> helps<00:04:14.230> it<00:04:14.489> lifetime<00:04:15.489> I<00:04:15.760> think<00:04:15.840> well<00:04:16.840> yeah<00:04:16.959> I

00:04:17.009 --> 00:04:17.019 
of helps it lifetime I think well yeah I

of helps it lifetime I think well yeah I
think<00:04:17.289> the<00:04:17.409> slores<00:04:17.769> batteries<00:04:18.280> are<00:04:18.489> pluck<00:04:18.940> the

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:19.120 
think the slores batteries are pluck the

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:21.060 
think the slores batteries are pluck the
longer<00:04:19.510> they<00:04:19.659> will<00:04:19.810> add<00:04:20.199> I<00:04:20.409> don't<00:04:20.620> know<00:04:20.709> a<00:04:20.739> ton

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:21.070 
longer they will add I don't know a ton

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:23.070 
longer they will add I don't know a ton
but<00:04:21.430> I<00:04:21.609> believe<00:04:22.030> in<00:04:22.150> each<00:04:22.210> fast<00:04:22.570> charge<00:04:22.900> and

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:23.080 
but I believe in each fast charge and

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:24.300 
but I believe in each fast charge and
