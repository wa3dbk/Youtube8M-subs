00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:25.690 
actually had a brain aneurysm at one

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:27.060 
actually had a brain aneurysm at one
point<00:02:25.900> which<00:02:26.140> kept<00:02:26.350> him<00:02:26.440> from<00:02:26.620> working<00:02:26.800> ever

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:27.070

lowercase B in either case I remember

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:59.400 
lowercase B in either case I remember
going<00:03:58.030> over<00:03:58.269> there<00:03:58.420> seeing<00:03:58.690> that<00:03:58.870> photo<00:03:59.110> and

00:03:59.400 --> 00:03:59.410 
going over there seeing that photo and

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:03.870 
going over there seeing that photo and
it<00:03:59.590> had<00:03:59.739> such<00:04:00.100> an<00:04:00.400> impact<00:04:00.760> on<00:04:01.180> me<00:04:01.709> this<00:04:02.880> very

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:03.880 
it had such an impact on me this very

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:06.569 
it had such an impact on me this very
curious<00:04:04.690> tightly<00:04:05.680> designed<00:04:05.829> black-and-white

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:06.579 
curious tightly designed black-and-white

00:04:06.579 --> 00:04:08.880 
curious tightly designed black-and-white
work<00:04:06.850> that<00:04:07.180> I<00:04:07.360> mean<00:04:07.840> I<00:04:07.900> think<00:04:07.959> that<00:04:08.170> that<00:04:08.350> photo

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:08.890 
work that I mean I think that that photo

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:10.350 
work that I mean I think that that photo
probably<00:04:09.250> is<00:04:09.489> what<00:04:09.670> made<00:04:09.850> me<00:04:10.000> want<00:04:10.209> to<00:04:10.239> become

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:10.360 
probably is what made me want to become

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:11.819 
probably is what made me want to become
a<00:04:10.510> photographer<00:04:10.660> later<00:04:11.230> there<00:04:11.440> was<00:04:11.500> something

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:11.829 
a photographer later there was something

00:04:11.829 --> 00:04:13.710 
a photographer later there was something
that<00:04:11.860> just<00:04:11.980> you<00:04:12.850> couldn't<00:04:13.180> get<00:04:13.269> your<00:04:13.390> mind<00:04:13.570> off

that just you couldn't get your mind off
about<00:04:14.170> that<00:04:14.350> and<00:04:14.470> obviously<00:04:14.829> it's<00:04:14.950> one<00:04:15.070> of

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:15.160 
about that and obviously it's one of

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:16.560

actually<00:06:54.570> having<00:06:54.840> to<00:06:54.990> show<00:06:55.170> it<00:06:55.230> to<00:06:55.350> you<00:06:55.440> on<00:06:55.530> my

00:06:55.610 --> 00:06:55.620 
actually having to show it to you on my

00:06:55.620 --> 00:06:57.110 
actually having to show it to you on my
wall<00:06:55.800> but<00:06:56.010> I<00:06:56.070> think<00:06:56.340> getting<00:06:56.610> a<00:06:56.760> sense<00:06:56.970> of<00:06:57.060> the

00:06:57.110 --> 00:06:57.120 
wall but I think getting a sense of the

00:06:57.120 --> 00:06:59.650 
wall but I think getting a sense of the
scale<00:06:57.390> is<00:06:58.260> pretty<00:06:58.500> interesting<00:06:59.010> as<00:06:59.100> well

00:06:59.650 --> 00:06:59.660 
scale is pretty interesting as well

00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:02.090 
scale is pretty interesting as well
unfortunately<00:07:00.660> Greg's<00:07:01.530> career<00:07:01.830> was<00:07:01.980> cut

00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:02.100 
unfortunately Greg's career was cut

00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:03.710 
unfortunately Greg's career was cut
pretty<00:07:02.340> short<00:07:02.670> right<00:07:03.030> around<00:07:03.300> the<00:07:03.480> time<00:07:03.660> the

00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:03.720 
pretty short right around the time the

00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:06.710 
pretty short right around the time the
internet<00:07:04.200> was<00:07:04.260> becoming<00:07:04.770> popular<00:07:05.150> and<00:07:06.150> he<00:07:06.540> had

00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:06.720 
internet was becoming popular and he had

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:08.120 
internet was becoming popular and he had
a<00:07:06.750> brain<00:07:06.960> aneurysm<00:07:07.500> that<00:07:07.530> actually<00:07:07.860> put<00:07:08.010> him

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:08.130 
a brain aneurysm that actually put him

00:07:08.130 --> 00:07:09.770 
a brain aneurysm that actually put him
out<00:07:08.220> of<00:07:08.310> work<00:07:08.460> for<00:07:09.060> ibed<00:07:09.180> another<00:07:09.420> 10<00:07:09.630> years

00:07:09.770 --> 00:07:09.780 
out of work for ibed another 10 years

00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:12.650 
out of work for ibed another 10 years
before<00:07:09.900> he<00:07:10.200> passed<00:07:10.410> away<00:07:10.640> but<00:07:11.640> I<00:07:12.000> think<00:07:12.480> it<00:07:12.570> was

00:07:12.650 --> 00:07:12.660 
before he passed away but I think it was

00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:15.050 
before he passed away but I think it was
very<00:07:12.750> difficult<00:07:13.110> and<00:07:14.010> unfortunately<00:07:14.970> I<00:07:15.000> think

00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:15.060 
very difficult and unfortunately I think

00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:16.670 
very difficult and unfortunately I think
the<00:07:15.420> in<00:07:15.600> Greg<00:07:15.870> would<00:07:16.020> have<00:07:16.110> never<00:07:16.290> said<00:07:16.530> this

00:07:16.670 --> 00:07:16.680 
the in Greg would have never said this

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:19.160 
the in Greg would have never said this
but<00:07:17.130> I<00:07:17.190> will<00:07:17.460> that<00:07:18.420> you<00:07:18.720> know<00:07:18.810> I<00:07:18.840> think<00:07:19.050> it's

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:19.170 
but I will that you know I think it's

00:07:19.170 --> 00:07:20.150 
but I will that you know I think it's
very<00:07:19.230> unfortunate<00:07:19.530> there's<00:07:19.920> a<00:07:20.010> whole

00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:20.160 
very unfortunate there's a whole

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:21.530 
very unfortunate there's a whole
generation<00:07:20.340> of<00:07:20.730> photographers<00:07:21.210> who<00:07:21.300> don't

00:07:21.530 --> 00:07:21.540 
generation of photographers who don't

00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:22.370 
generation of photographers who don't
know<00:07:21.690> who<00:07:21.810> he<00:07:21.930> is

00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:22.380 
know who he is

00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:24.980 
know who he is
and<00:07:22.620> I<00:07:23.130> thought<00:07:23.430> I<00:07:23.940> think<00:07:24.300> because<00:07:24.690> he<00:07:24.840> was<00:07:24.960> a

00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:24.990 
and I thought I think because he was a

00:07:24.990 --> 00:07:26.630 
and I thought I think because he was a
personal<00:07:25.350> friend<00:07:25.530> I<00:07:25.800> haven't<00:07:26.130> really

together<00:07:32.910> an<00:07:33.180> enormous<00:07:33.480> amount<00:07:33.630> of<00:07:33.750> projects

00:07:34.130 --> 00:07:34.140 
together an enormous amount of projects

00:07:34.140 --> 00:07:36.020 
together an enormous amount of projects
and<00:07:34.320> you<00:07:35.160> know<00:07:35.250> Kara<00:07:35.490> went<00:07:35.670> on<00:07:35.730> to<00:07:35.850> run<00:07:36.000> the

00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:36.030 
and you know Kara went on to run the

00:07:36.030 --> 00:07:38.060 
and you know Kara went on to run the
studio<00:07:36.420> and<00:07:36.870> actually<00:07:37.380> did<00:07:37.770> that<00:07:37.860> up<00:07:37.980> until

00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:38.070 
studio and actually did that up until

00:07:38.070 --> 00:07:39.980 
studio and actually did that up until
recently<00:07:38.610> and<00:07:38.910> I<00:07:39.240> think<00:07:39.450> she<00:07:39.570> would<00:07:39.690> be<00:07:39.720> a<00:07:39.840> good

00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:39.990 
recently and I think she would be a good

00:07:39.990 --> 00:07:41.690 
recently and I think she would be a good
person<00:07:40.320> to<00:07:40.380> have<00:07:40.440> on<00:07:40.560> here<00:07:40.950> not<00:07:41.130> only<00:07:41.250> to<00:07:41.490> talk

00:07:41.690 --> 00:07:41.700 
person to have on here not only to talk

00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:43.880 
person to have on here not only to talk
about<00:07:41.880> Greg's<00:07:42.450> philosophy<00:07:43.050> and<00:07:43.380> his<00:07:43.620> way<00:07:43.800> of

00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:43.890 
about Greg's philosophy and his way of

00:07:43.890 --> 00:07:46.640 
about Greg's philosophy and his way of
taking<00:07:44.040> pictures<00:07:44.520> but<00:07:45.150> also<00:07:45.420> I<00:07:46.170> think<00:07:46.560> she

00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:46.650 
taking pictures but also I think she

00:07:46.650 --> 00:07:48.440 
taking pictures but also I think she
would<00:07:46.770> be<00:07:46.800> a<00:07:46.890> good<00:07:47.070> interview<00:07:47.430> because<00:07:47.850> she

00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:48.450 
would be a good interview because she

00:07:48.450 --> 00:07:50.450 
would be a good interview because she
has<00:07:48.750> experience<00:07:49.260> with<00:07:49.680> business<00:07:50.100> and<00:07:50.280> running

00:07:50.450 --> 00:07:50.460 
has experience with business and running

00:07:50.460 --> 00:07:51.830 
has experience with business and running
a<00:07:50.490> photography<00:07:50.940> studio<00:07:51.210> which<00:07:51.420> I<00:07:51.540> think<00:07:51.720> is

00:07:51.830 --> 00:07:51.840 
a photography studio which I think is

00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:54.680 
a photography studio which I think is
really<00:07:52.290> important<00:07:52.800> as<00:07:53.010> well<00:07:53.220> so<00:07:53.460> anyway<00:07:54.360> I

00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:54.690 
really important as well so anyway I

00:07:54.690 --> 00:07:56.120 
really important as well so anyway I
