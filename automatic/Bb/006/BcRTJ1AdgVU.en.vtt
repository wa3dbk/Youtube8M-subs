real time or for virtualization support
in<00:00:54.610> hardware<00:00:54.970> and<00:00:55.180> then<00:00:55.630> we<00:00:55.780> have<00:00:55.989> the<00:00:56.140> M<00:00:56.260> force

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:56.590 
in hardware and then we have the M force

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:58.860 
in hardware and then we have the M force
which<00:00:56.829> gives<00:00:57.070> us<00:00:57.220> very<00:00:57.270> responsive<00:00:58.270> low-power

00:00:58.860 --> 00:00:58.870 
which gives us very responsive low-power

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:00.600 
which gives us very responsive low-power
offload<00:00:59.469> so<00:01:00.040> it's<00:01:00.160> a<00:01:00.219> really<00:01:00.430> unique

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:00.610 
offload so it's a really unique

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:02.430 
offload so it's a really unique

built<00:01:14.499> upon<00:01:14.799> the<00:01:14.829> omap4<00:01:15.329> so<00:01:16.329> customers<00:01:16.749> that

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:16.840 
built upon the omap4 so customers that

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:18.539 
built upon the omap4 so customers that
are<00:01:16.959> doing<00:01:17.200> oh<00:01:17.350> my<00:01:17.530> for<00:01:17.770> today<00:01:18.009> can<00:01:18.189> actually

are doing oh my for today can actually

00:01:18.549 --> 00:01:20.489 
are doing oh my for today can actually
migrate<00:01:18.939> very<00:01:19.149> quickly<00:01:19.479> to<00:01:19.659> take<00:01:20.049> advantage

00:01:23.699 --> 00:01:23.709 
of the cortex a15 it takes it to the

00:01:23.709 --> 00:01:24.989 
of the cortex a15 it takes it to the
next<00:01:23.799> level<00:01:24.039> though<00:01:24.369> it's<00:01:24.520> not<00:01:24.549> just<00:01:24.880> about

00:01:24.989 --> 00:01:24.999 
next level though it's not just about

00:01:24.999 --> 00:01:26.940 
next level though it's not just about
performance<00:01:25.749> performance<00:01:26.049> comes<00:01:26.590> with<00:01:26.770> it

performance performance comes with it

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:28.949 
performance performance comes with it
it's<00:01:27.399> about<00:01:27.549> a<00:01:27.700> 2<00:01:27.909> to<00:01:27.999> 3<00:01:28.179> X<00:01:28.329> performance<00:01:28.840> and

00:01:28.949 --> 00:01:28.959 
it's about a 2 to 3 X performance and

00:01:28.959 --> 00:01:32.370 
it's about a 2 to 3 X performance and
cpu<00:01:29.439> 5x<00:01:30.429> performance<00:01:30.999> in<00:01:31.179> GPU<00:01:31.929> and<00:01:32.319> the
