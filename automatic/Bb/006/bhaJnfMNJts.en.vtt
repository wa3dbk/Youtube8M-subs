that's what a mobile quarterback can do

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:16.320 
that's what a mobile quarterback can do
for<00:05:14.860> you<00:05:14.920> because<00:05:15.490> very<00:05:15.700> close<00:05:15.970> to<00:05:16.090> the<00:05:16.120> first

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:16.330 
for you because very close to the first

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:18.180

now but he does pick it up with work
than<00:05:18.340> inches<00:05:18.640> I<00:05:18.820> should<00:05:19.390> have<00:05:19.450> stopped<00:05:19.720> it<00:05:19.870> but

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:19.930 
than inches I should have stopped it but

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:21.360 
than inches I should have stopped it but
I<00:05:20.020> don't<00:05:20.230> have<00:05:20.320> my<00:05:20.440> Detroit<00:05:20.740> playbook<00:05:21.070> damn<00:05:21.220> it

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:31.000 
lagging so what I usually do is I pause

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:32.820

previously<00:05:52.930> I<00:05:53.020> usually<00:05:53.410> piece<00:05:53.620> together<00:05:53.800> like

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:54.610 
previously I usually piece together like

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:56.070 
previously I usually piece together like
the<00:05:54.760> next<00:05:55.000> game<00:05:55.150> but<00:05:55.330> the<00:05:55.419> next<00:05:55.690> game<00:05:55.840> is<00:05:55.870> a

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:56.080 
the next game but the next game is a

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:59.760 
the next game but the next game is a
full<00:05:56.410> game<00:05:56.680> and<00:05:57.040> it's<00:05:57.550> an<00:05:57.729> amazing<00:05:58.540> game<00:05:58.780> and<00:05:59.050> I

00:05:59.760 --> 00:05:59.770 
full game and it's an amazing game and I

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:01.680 
full game and it's an amazing game and I
felt<00:05:59.950> like<00:06:00.220> it<00:06:00.400> deserves<00:06:00.760> a<00:06:00.910> video<00:06:01.180> on<00:06:01.330> its<00:06:01.510> own

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:01.690 
felt like it deserves a video on its own

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:03.719 
felt like it deserves a video on its own
so<00:06:01.720> I<00:06:01.930> didn't<00:06:02.140> want<00:06:02.260> to<00:06:02.320> piece<00:06:02.530> this<00:06:03.160> game<00:06:03.490> in

00:06:03.719 --> 00:06:03.729 
so I didn't want to piece this game in

00:06:03.729 --> 00:06:05.820 
so I didn't want to piece this game in
the<00:06:03.910> other<00:06:04.030> game<00:06:04.240> together<00:06:04.450> like<00:06:05.350> you<00:06:05.680> guys
