well thanks for having me here today
alright<00:01:05.570> so<00:01:05.960> the<00:01:06.590> bounce<00:01:07.130> test<00:01:07.520> why<00:01:08.210> does<00:01:08.450> it

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:08.630 
alright so the bounce test why does it

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:10.899 
alright so the bounce test why does it
fail<00:01:08.869> you<00:01:09.290> know<00:01:09.439> originally<00:01:10.310> we<00:01:10.430> call<00:01:10.670> this<00:01:10.850> a

00:01:10.899 --> 00:01:10.909 
fail you know originally we call this a

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:13.420 
fail you know originally we call this a
bouncing<00:01:11.540> Jones<00:01:11.840> test<00:01:12.259> and<00:01:12.649> what<00:01:13.220> it<00:01:13.340> is

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:13.430 
bouncing Jones test and what it is

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:15.550 
bouncing Jones test and what it is
basically<00:01:13.729> is<00:01:14.149> when<00:01:14.360> you<00:01:14.479> take<00:01:14.720> one<00:01:15.049> corner<00:01:15.409> of

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:15.560 
basically is when you take one corner of

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:17.680 
basically is when you take one corner of
the<00:01:15.680> vehicle<00:01:15.860> and<00:01:16.280> move<00:01:16.729> it<00:01:16.909> aggressively<00:01:17.450> up

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:17.690 
the vehicle and move it aggressively up

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:20.170 
the vehicle and move it aggressively up
and<00:01:17.900> down<00:01:18.020> release<00:01:18.860> that<00:01:19.310> movement<00:01:19.850> and<00:01:20.000> then

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:20.180 
and down release that movement and then

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:22.120 
and down release that movement and then
see<00:01:20.450> how<00:01:20.600> many<00:01:20.780> times<00:01:21.080> it<00:01:21.320> moves<00:01:21.560> to<00:01:21.770> recover

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:22.130 
see how many times it moves to recover

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:24.250 
see how many times it moves to recover
was<00:01:22.729> a<00:01:22.760> was<00:01:23.330> a<00:01:23.360> test<00:01:23.659> we've<00:01:23.840> been<00:01:23.990> doing<00:01:24.229> for

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:24.260 
was a was a test we've been doing for

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.410 
was a was a test we've been doing for
years<00:01:24.770> to<00:01:25.040> estimate<00:01:25.700> the<00:01:25.880> condition<00:01:26.300> of

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:26.420 
years to estimate the condition of

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:28.360 
years to estimate the condition of
shocks<00:01:26.630> and<00:01:26.900> struts<00:01:27.110> all<00:01:27.650> right<00:01:27.770> but<00:01:27.979> that

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:28.370 
shocks and struts all right but that

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:30.640 
shocks and struts all right but that
really<00:01:28.670> only<00:01:28.790> checks<00:01:29.210> part<00:01:29.630> of<00:01:29.900> the<00:01:30.140> shock<00:01:30.380> or

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:30.650 
really only checks part of the shock or

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:32.170 
really only checks part of the shock or
the<00:01:30.710> strut<00:01:31.070> right<00:01:31.340> yeah<00:01:31.640> that's<00:01:31.790> a<00:01:31.940> very<00:01:32.060> good

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:32.180 
the strut right yeah that's a very good

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:34.420 
the strut right yeah that's a very good
point<00:01:32.570> in<00:01:32.810> fact<00:01:32.990> here<00:01:33.440> we<00:01:33.560> have<00:01:33.740> an<00:01:33.860> example<00:01:34.190> of

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:34.430 
point in fact here we have an example of

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:37.690 
point in fact here we have an example of
a<00:01:34.520> twin<00:01:34.760> tube<00:01:34.970> shock<00:01:35.270> and<00:01:35.510> strut<00:01:35.780> from<00:01:36.250> KYB<00:01:37.250> and

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:37.700 
a twin tube shock and strut from KYB and

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:40.270 
a twin tube shock and strut from KYB and
the<00:01:38.210> way<00:01:38.330> it<00:01:38.450> works<00:01:38.690> is<00:01:39.049> basically<00:01:39.470> one<00:01:39.799> end<00:01:40.070> is

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:40.280 
the way it works is basically one end is

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:42.160 
the way it works is basically one end is
attached<00:01:40.670> to<00:01:40.850> a<00:01:40.940> wheel<00:01:41.240> the<00:01:41.540> other<00:01:41.690> end<00:01:41.930> to<00:01:42.080> the

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:42.170 
attached to a wheel the other end to the

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:44.289 
attached to a wheel the other end to the
body<00:01:42.380> and<00:01:42.680> it's<00:01:43.190> moving<00:01:43.430> up<00:01:43.700> and<00:01:43.850> down<00:01:43.940> with

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:44.299 
body and it's moving up and down with

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:46.840 
body and it's moving up and down with
every<00:01:44.630> body<00:01:44.840> movement<00:01:45.470> every<00:01:46.070> wheel<00:01:46.310> movement

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:46.850 
every body movement every wheel movement

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:49.750 
every body movement every wheel movement
it<00:01:47.299> moves<00:01:47.600> actually<00:01:48.200> anywhere<00:01:48.590> from<00:01:48.830> 1,500<00:01:49.729> to

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:49.760 
it moves actually anywhere from 1,500 to

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:52.840 
it moves actually anywhere from 1,500 to
1,900<00:01:50.570> times<00:01:50.840> a<00:01:51.049> mile<00:01:51.320> and<00:01:51.650> inside<00:01:52.610> the

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:52.850 
1,900 times a mile and inside the

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:55.420 
1,900 times a mile and inside the
valving<00:01:53.390> that<00:01:54.080> moves<00:01:54.380> the<00:01:54.530> hydraulic<00:01:55.100> fluid

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:55.430 
valving that moves the hydraulic fluid

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:57.550 
valving that moves the hydraulic fluid
to<00:01:55.460> each<00:01:55.700> side<00:01:56.000> of<00:01:56.180> the<00:01:56.240> piston<00:01:56.420> are<00:01:56.900> a<00:01:57.020> series

to each side of the piston are a series

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:59.500 
to each side of the piston are a series
of<00:01:57.590> valves<00:01:58.070> there's<00:01:58.250> a<00:01:58.310> first<00:01:58.640> second<00:01:59.299> third

00:01:59.500 --> 00:01:59.510 
of valves there's a first second third

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:02.260 
of valves there's a first second third
stage<00:01:59.900> sometimes<00:02:00.320> even<00:02:00.890> more<00:02:01.130> the<00:02:01.820> second

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:02.270 
stage sometimes even more the second

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:04.359 
stage sometimes even more the second
third<00:02:02.570> stages<00:02:02.930> are<00:02:03.380> the<00:02:03.770> are<00:02:04.100> the<00:02:04.159> real

00:02:04.359 --> 00:02:04.369 
third stages are the are the real

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:06.789 
third stages are the are the real
workhorse<00:02:04.640> the<00:02:05.150> ones<00:02:05.390> that<00:02:05.780> that<00:02:06.290> control

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:06.799 
workhorse the ones that that control

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:08.800 
workhorse the ones that that control
those<00:02:07.070> heavy<00:02:07.369> movements<00:02:08.000> big<00:02:08.239> bumps<00:02:08.599> and<00:02:08.750> all

those heavy movements big bumps and all

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:10.240 
those heavy movements big bumps and all
and<00:02:09.080> really<00:02:09.170> that's<00:02:09.470> what<00:02:09.649> you're<00:02:09.799> checking

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:10.250 
and really that's what you're checking

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:12.670 
and really that's what you're checking

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.320 
with the bouncing Jones test but the
valve<00:02:12.920> that<00:02:13.220> works<00:02:13.400> the<00:02:13.580> hardest<00:02:13.610> is<00:02:14.209> the

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:14.330 
valve that works the hardest is the

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:16.390 
valve that works the hardest is the
first<00:02:14.629> stage<00:02:14.930> the<00:02:15.260> one<00:02:15.709> that's<00:02:15.920> controlling

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.400 
first stage the one that's controlling

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.130 
first stage the one that's controlling
all<00:02:16.700> that<00:02:16.909> little<00:02:17.120> bit<00:02:17.330> of<00:02:17.360> tire<00:02:17.659> movement

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:18.140 
all that little bit of tire movement

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:20.110 
all that little bit of tire movement
that<00:02:18.349> little<00:02:18.650> bit<00:02:18.799> of<00:02:18.890> body<00:02:19.069> movement<00:02:19.639> that

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:20.120 
that little bit of body movement that

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:21.909 
that little bit of body movement that
really<00:02:20.540> adds<00:02:20.719> stability<00:02:21.019> of<00:02:21.439> the<00:02:21.499> vehicle

00:02:21.909 --> 00:02:21.919 
really adds stability of the vehicle

00:02:21.919 --> 00:02:24.129 
really adds stability of the vehicle
that's<00:02:22.310> the<00:02:22.639> one<00:02:22.909> we're<00:02:23.150> concerned<00:02:23.599> about<00:02:23.779> but

00:02:24.129 --> 00:02:24.139 
that's the one we're concerned about but

00:02:24.139 --> 00:02:24.730 
that's the one we're concerned about but
you<00:02:24.290> can't

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:24.740 
you can't

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:26.320 
you can't
check<00:02:25.010> it<00:02:25.130> with<00:02:25.250> the<00:02:25.340> bouncing<00:02:25.730> Jones<00:02:25.940> test

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:26.330 
check it with the bouncing Jones test

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:29.290 
check it with the bouncing Jones test
okay<00:02:27.050> well<00:02:27.530> if<00:02:27.800> we<00:02:28.070> can't<00:02:28.310> do<00:02:28.490> it<00:02:28.640> with<00:02:29.180> the

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:29.300 
okay well if we can't do it with the

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:32.050 
okay well if we can't do it with the
bounce<00:02:29.480> test<00:02:29.780> what<00:02:30.710> do<00:02:30.890> we<00:02:31.040> do<00:02:31.220> well<00:02:31.640> the<00:02:31.850> best

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:32.060 
bounce test what do we do well the best

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:34.030 
bounce test what do we do well the best
way<00:02:32.150> is<00:02:32.390> to<00:02:32.420> give<00:02:32.630> it<00:02:32.750> a<00:02:32.780> good<00:02:32.930> road<00:02:33.170> test<00:02:33.500> and

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:34.040 
way is to give it a good road test and

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:35.830 
way is to give it a good road test and
what<00:02:34.550> you'd<00:02:34.700> want<00:02:34.730> to<00:02:34.970> be<00:02:35.090> looking<00:02:35.420> for<00:02:35.660> is<00:02:35.810> a

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:35.840 
what you'd want to be looking for is a

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:37.360 
what you'd want to be looking for is a

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:56.390 
conditions but you'd want to make sure

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:58.360 
conditions but you'd want to make sure
that<00:02:56.540> you're<00:02:56.690> comparing<00:02:57.260> that<00:02:57.530> current

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:58.370 
that you're comparing that current

that you're comparing that current

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:00.170 
condition the vehicle to the vehicle's

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:02.320 
condition the vehicle to the vehicle's
original<00:03:00.740> capability<00:03:01.430> or<00:03:01.610> what<00:03:01.910> it<00:03:02.030> would<00:03:02.150> be

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:02.330 
original capability or what it would be

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:04.000 
original capability or what it would be
like<00:03:02.540> if<00:03:02.750> you<00:03:02.840> replace<00:03:03.290> the<00:03:03.530> shocks<00:03:03.800> and

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:04.010 
like if you replace the shocks and

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:05.950 
like if you replace the shocks and
struts<00:03:04.280> well<00:03:04.520> this<00:03:04.670> is<00:03:04.820> pretty<00:03:04.970> subjective<00:03:05.330> so

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:05.960 
struts well this is pretty subjective so

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:08.590 
struts well this is pretty subjective so
this<00:03:06.140> means<00:03:06.380> you<00:03:06.650> want<00:03:06.920> a<00:03:07.160> good<00:03:07.610> qualified

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:08.600
