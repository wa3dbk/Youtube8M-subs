00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
be riding it for a while as it's winter

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.370 
be riding it for a while as it's winter
but<00:00:20.850> if<00:00:21.060> you<00:00:21.210> want<00:00:21.390> to<00:00:21.510> see<00:00:21.689> it<00:00:21.810> running<00:00:22.050> and

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
but if you want to see it running and

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.429 
but if you want to see it running and
driving<00:00:22.519> go<00:00:23.519> check<00:00:23.760> out<00:00:23.939> the<00:00:24.180> spark<00:00:24.960> plug<00:00:25.199> kids

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
driving go check out the spark plug kids

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:30.470 
driving go check out the spark plug kids
channel<00:00:26.510> so<00:00:27.859> there<00:00:28.859> you<00:00:29.130> can<00:00:29.310> see<00:00:29.550> it<00:00:29.760> driving

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
channel so there you can see it driving

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.340 
channel so there you can see it driving
and<00:00:30.689> me<00:00:31.050> riding<00:00:31.260> it<00:00:32.360> but<00:00:33.360> there's<00:00:33.870> no<00:00:33.989> gas<00:00:34.320> in

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
and me riding it but there's no gas in

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.910 
and me riding it but there's no gas in
it<00:00:34.649> right<00:00:34.770> now<00:00:34.829> I<00:00:35.219> took<00:00:35.579> all<00:00:35.969> the<00:00:36.090> plastics<00:00:36.660> off

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:36.920 
it right now I took all the plastics off

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:40.959 
it right now I took all the plastics off
because<00:00:38.000> they<00:00:39.000> were<00:00:39.120> pretty<00:00:39.719> rough

00:00:40.959 --> 00:00:40.969 
because they were pretty rough

00:00:40.969 --> 00:00:45.729 
because they were pretty rough
frighteners<00:00:41.969> craft<00:00:42.870> and<00:00:43.320> scratched<00:00:44.239> so<00:00:45.239> I

00:00:45.729 --> 00:00:45.739 
frighteners craft and scratched so I

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:47.840 
frighteners craft and scratched so I
think<00:00:46.739> it<00:00:46.800> looks<00:00:46.829> a<00:00:47.039> little<00:00:47.190> better<00:00:47.460> without

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
think it looks a little better without

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.830 
think it looks a little better without
them<00:00:48.170> mounted<00:00:49.170> the<00:00:49.289> seat<00:00:49.530> on<00:00:50.449> gas<00:00:51.449> tank

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
them mounted the seat on gas tank

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:57.549 
them mounted the seat on gas tank
strapped<00:00:52.710> on<00:00:52.949> there<00:00:53.539> um<00:00:55.280> runs<00:00:56.280> pretty<00:00:57.090> good

00:00:57.549 --> 00:00:57.559 
strapped on there um runs pretty good

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:00.260 
strapped on there um runs pretty good
doesn't<00:00:58.559> really<00:00:59.129> idle<00:00:59.579> for<00:00:59.789> a<00:00:59.850> very<00:01:00.030> long<00:01:00.210> time

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
doesn't really idle for a very long time

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:05.060 
doesn't really idle for a very long time
and<00:01:00.840> sometimes<00:01:01.050> leaks<00:01:01.649> gas<00:01:01.980> so<00:01:02.430> I<00:01:02.460> put<00:01:02.820> a<00:01:04.070> screw

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
and sometimes leaks gas so I put a screw

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.070 
and sometimes leaks gas so I put a screw
in<00:01:05.100> there<00:01:05.369> this<00:01:05.580> is<00:01:05.729> these<00:01:05.880> aren't<00:01:06.330> like<00:01:06.510> you

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
in there this is these aren't like you

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.100 
in there this is these aren't like you
can't<00:01:07.320> really<00:01:07.710> depend<00:01:07.920> on<00:01:08.340> these<00:01:08.460> kind<00:01:08.760> of

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:09.110 
can't really depend on these kind of

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:11.570 
can't really depend on these kind of
pocket<00:01:10.110> bikes<00:01:10.320> for<00:01:10.680> like<00:01:10.890> dependability

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
pocket bikes for like dependability

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.870 
pocket bikes for like dependability
because<00:01:12.090> they're<00:01:12.240> very<00:01:12.510> cheap<00:01:13.729> carbs<00:01:14.729> are

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
because they're very cheap carbs are

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.730 
because they're very cheap carbs are
very<00:01:15.060> cheap<00:01:15.390> so<00:01:15.420> I<00:01:17.180> would<00:01:18.180> not<00:01:18.450> never<00:01:19.020> spend<00:01:19.530> a

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
very cheap so I would not never spend a

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:20.990 
very cheap so I would not never spend a
lot<00:01:19.920> of<00:01:19.950> money<00:01:20.070> on<00:01:20.310> one<00:01:20.520> of<00:01:20.640> these<00:01:20.759> things

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
lot of money on one of these things

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.070 
lot of money on one of these things
maybe<00:01:21.740> if<00:01:22.740> you<00:01:23.130> race<00:01:23.460> them<00:01:23.490> and<00:01:24.119> you<00:01:24.900> have

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
maybe if you race them and you have

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.840 
maybe if you race them and you have
different<00:01:25.470> motors<00:01:25.770> and<00:01:25.920> stuff<00:01:26.009> that<00:01:26.310> maybe<00:01:26.610> it

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
different motors and stuff that maybe it

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.950 
different motors and stuff that maybe it
would<00:01:26.909> be<00:01:27.060> worth<00:01:27.240> it<00:01:27.450> but<00:01:27.659> I<00:01:27.869> would<00:01:28.200> never<00:01:28.939> so

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:29.960 
would be worth it but I would never so

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:32.539 
would be worth it but I would never so
it<00:01:30.960> was<00:01:31.079> kind<00:01:31.380> of<00:01:31.439> dirty<00:01:31.650> when<00:01:31.890> I<00:01:31.979> got<00:01:32.189> it<00:01:32.400> I

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
it was kind of dirty when I got it I

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:36.170 
it was kind of dirty when I got it I
tried<00:01:33.479> polishing<00:01:34.079> up<00:01:34.200> the<00:01:34.759> expansion<00:01:35.759> chamber

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
tried polishing up the expansion chamber

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.690 
tried polishing up the expansion chamber
and<00:01:36.270> got<00:01:36.509> to<00:01:36.689> use<00:01:36.810> pretty<00:01:37.110> shiny<00:01:37.460> you<00:01:38.460> can<00:01:38.579> see

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
and got to use pretty shiny you can see

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.950 
and got to use pretty shiny you can see
my<00:01:38.850> reflection<00:01:41.210> so<00:01:42.210> I'm<00:01:42.360> pretty<00:01:42.540> happy<00:01:42.659> about

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
my reflection so I'm pretty happy about

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.770 
my reflection so I'm pretty happy about
that<00:01:43.640> can't<00:01:44.640> start<00:01:45.000> it<00:01:45.119> because<00:01:45.329> i<00:01:45.450> drained

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
that can't start it because i drained

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.460 
that can't start it because i drained
all<00:01:45.930> the<00:01:45.960> gas<00:01:46.229> out<00:01:46.500> of<00:01:46.560> it<00:01:46.799> to<00:01:47.990> tempt<00:01:48.990> me<00:01:49.079> from

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
all the gas out of it to tempt me from

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.999 
all the gas out of it to tempt me from
riding<00:01:49.710> it<00:01:49.950> around<00:01:51.020> rear<00:01:52.020> suspension<00:01:52.799> this

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
riding it around rear suspension this

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:55.490 
riding it around rear suspension this
was<00:01:53.250> apparently<00:01:53.970> the<00:01:54.060> limit<00:01:54.420> edition<00:01:54.659> what

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
was apparently the limit edition what

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:00.350 
was apparently the limit edition what
they<00:01:55.680> do<00:01:55.890> over<00:01:55.950> your<00:01:56.310> exhaust

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:07.200 

it<00:02:01.360> is<00:02:01.690> a<00:02:02.070> 2005<00:02:03.070> so<00:02:03.550> I've<00:02:03.670> got<00:02:04.480> some<00:02:04.690> age<00:02:04.870> to<00:02:04.900> it
