00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:52.050 
yeah so i'm using 357 you know the
predator<00:04:50.210> missile<00:04:50.540> obviously<00:04:51.020> it's<00:04:51.320> a<00:04:51.410> pretty

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:52.060 
predator missile obviously it's a pretty

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:54.640 
predator missile obviously it's a pretty
it's<00:04:53.060> a<00:04:53.180> really<00:04:53.720> useful<00:04:53.960> killstreak<00:04:54.500> for

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:54.650 
it's a really useful killstreak for

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:56.620 
it's a really useful killstreak for
getting<00:04:54.830> your<00:04:54.920> 7<00:04:55.280> because<00:04:55.460> it<00:04:56.150> pretty<00:04:56.540> much

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:56.630 
getting your 7 because it pretty much

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:59.290 
getting your 7 because it pretty much
guarantees<00:04:57.080> you<00:04:57.290> one<00:04:57.500> or<00:04:57.620> two<00:04:57.650> kills<00:04:58.300> usually

00:04:59.290 --> 00:04:59.300 
guarantees you one or two kills usually

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:02.770 
guarantees you one or two kills usually
one<00:04:59.570> but<00:05:00.230> you<00:05:00.800> just<00:05:00.920> got<00:05:01.550> to<00:05:01.580> go<00:05:01.820> for<00:05:01.850> the

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:02.780 
one but you just got to go for the

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:04.660 
one but you just got to go for the
person<00:05:03.110> you<00:05:03.230> can<00:05:03.620> go<00:05:03.860> for<00:05:04.100> with<00:05:04.280> the<00:05:04.370> predator

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:04.670 
person you can go for with the predator

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:05.830 
person you can go for with the predator
