00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
distance without a flashlight this is

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:18.859 
distance without a flashlight this is
gonna<00:00:17.279> go<00:00:17.490> inside<00:00:17.820> the<00:00:17.970> jug<00:00:18.270> I<00:00:18.510> mean<00:00:18.690> to<00:00:18.750> make

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
gonna go inside the jug I mean to make

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:22.189 
gonna go inside the jug I mean to make
the<00:00:18.990> jug<00:00:19.199> separately<00:00:20.689> you<00:00:21.689> see<00:00:21.900> it's<00:00:22.080> just

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
the jug separately you see it's just

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.620 
the jug separately you see it's just
like<00:00:22.439> a<00:00:22.590> sealed<00:00:23.160> capsule<00:00:23.369> I<00:00:23.789> made<00:00:24.060> it<00:00:24.210> with

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
like a sealed capsule I made it with

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.189 
like a sealed capsule I made it with
parts<00:00:25.170> really<00:00:25.800> random<00:00:26.099> parts<00:00:26.519> lying<00:00:26.730> around

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:27.199 
parts really random parts lying around

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:29.300 
parts really random parts lying around
so<00:00:28.199> I'm<00:00:28.410> not<00:00:28.560> really<00:00:28.710> gonna<00:00:28.920> show<00:00:29.099> you<00:00:29.160> how<00:00:29.220> to

so I'm not really gonna show you how to

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:30.710 
so I'm not really gonna show you how to
make<00:00:29.519> it<00:00:29.699> because<00:00:30.029> there's<00:00:30.210> nothing<00:00:30.570> really

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
make it because there's nothing really

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.290

specific<00:00:31.080> about<00:00:31.470> it<00:00:31.650> I<00:00:31.859> just<00:00:32.099> made<00:00:32.340> it<00:00:32.940> out<00:00:33.120> of

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
specific about it I just made it out of

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.049 
specific about it I just made it out of
whatever<00:00:33.480> I<00:00:33.660> had<00:00:33.950> it<00:00:34.950> sealed<00:00:35.370> with<00:00:35.880> silicone

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
whatever I had it sealed with silicone

whatever I had it sealed with silicone
and<00:00:36.390> wrapped<00:00:36.750> in<00:00:36.960> electrical<00:00:37.140> tape<00:00:37.559> so<00:00:37.800> it<00:00:37.920> is

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
and wrapped in electrical tape so it is

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:44.990 
and wrapped in electrical tape so it is
waterproof<00:00:38.660> and<00:00:41.329> this<00:00:42.329> little<00:00:43.940> this<00:00:44.940> little

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
waterproof and this little this little

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.209 
waterproof and this little this little
piece<00:00:45.329> of<00:00:45.360> metal<00:00:45.510> coming<00:00:46.079> out<00:00:46.200> here<00:00:46.559> just<00:00:47.100> a

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
piece of metal coming out here just a

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:52.970 
piece of metal coming out here just a
paper<00:00:47.430> clip<00:00:48.020> when<00:00:49.020> that<00:00:49.170> gets<00:00:49.289> pulled<00:00:49.680> on<00:00:51.980> just

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
paper clip when that gets pulled on just

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.420 
paper clip when that gets pulled on just
a<00:00:53.100> little<00:00:53.129> bit<00:00:53.460> it<00:00:54.000> starts<00:00:54.329> flashing<00:00:54.510> green

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:55.430 
a little bit it starts flashing green

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:57.560 
a little bit it starts flashing green
obviously<00:00:56.430> I'm<00:00:56.520> gonna<00:00:56.670> hook<00:00:56.820> up<00:00:57.000> the<00:00:57.149> line<00:00:57.360> on

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
obviously I'm gonna hook up the line on

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.420 
obviously I'm gonna hook up the line on
the<00:00:57.690> jug<00:00:57.960> to<00:00:58.320> this<00:00:58.500> and<00:00:58.770> that's<00:00:58.920> this<00:00:59.219> not

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
the jug to this and that's this not

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.160 
the jug to this and that's this not
gonna<00:00:59.579> hold<00:00:59.850> the<00:01:00.059> weight<00:01:00.480> of<00:01:00.660> the<00:01:00.780> line<00:01:00.930> is

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
gonna hold the weight of the line is

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:02.959 
gonna hold the weight of the line is
just<00:01:01.410> gonna<00:01:01.559> be<00:01:01.739> clamped<00:01:02.160> on<00:01:02.280> a<00:01:02.309> little<00:01:02.609> bit<00:01:02.760> so

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
just gonna be clamped on a little bit so

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:06.350 
just gonna be clamped on a little bit so
the<00:01:03.090> Lund<00:01:03.270> can<00:01:03.539> give<00:01:03.690> it<00:01:03.809> a<00:01:03.899> tug<00:01:04.760> and<00:01:05.760> then<00:01:06.030> the

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
the Lund can give it a tug and then the

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:07.850 
the Lund can give it a tug and then the
rest<00:01:06.570> of<00:01:06.659> the<00:01:06.750> line<00:01:06.900> will<00:01:07.049> be<00:01:07.080> fastened<00:01:07.650> to<00:01:07.680> the

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
rest of the line will be fastened to the

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.760 
rest of the line will be fastened to the
jug<00:01:08.130> so<00:01:08.640> it's<00:01:08.790> more<00:01:08.939> secure<00:01:09.330> and<00:01:10.020> whenever

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
jug so it's more secure and whenever

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.920 
jug so it's more secure and whenever
fish<00:01:11.159> takes<00:01:11.400> it<00:01:11.580> the<00:01:11.939> jugs<00:01:12.270> gonna<00:01:12.510> be<00:01:12.600> designed

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
fish takes it the jugs gonna be designed

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.740 
fish takes it the jugs gonna be designed
so<00:01:13.110> it<00:01:13.140> flips<00:01:13.470> over<00:01:13.710> and<00:01:14.549> starts<00:01:14.939> blinking<00:01:15.180> so

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
so it flips over and starts blinking so
