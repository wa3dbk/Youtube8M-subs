hi it's John Chrysostom a tardy well

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:15.740 
hi it's John Chrysostom a tardy well
today<00:00:13.559> we<00:00:13.950> have<00:00:13.980> some<00:00:14.519> little<00:00:15.089> screws<00:00:15.450> here

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
today we have some little screws here

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.099 
today we have some little screws here
that<00:00:16.010> we're<00:00:17.010> going<00:00:17.130> to<00:00:17.220> modify<00:00:17.609> I'm<00:00:18.539> making<00:00:18.960> up

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
that we're going to modify I'm making up

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:22.540 
that we're going to modify I'm making up
a<00:00:19.230> new<00:00:19.760> tool<00:00:20.760> for<00:00:21.180> our<00:00:21.210> CNC<00:00:21.930> milling<00:00:22.320> machine

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:22.550 
a new tool for our CNC milling machine

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:25.300 
a new tool for our CNC milling machine
so<00:00:23.550> it<00:00:23.640> can<00:00:23.789> do<00:00:23.939> sleeves<00:00:24.600> a<00:00:24.720> little<00:00:24.930> bit<00:00:25.019> more

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:25.310 
so it can do sleeves a little bit more

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:29.750 
so it can do sleeves a little bit more
efficiently<00:00:26.310> and<00:00:26.910> this<00:00:27.840> is<00:00:28.019> what<00:00:28.230> the<00:00:28.760> cutter

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
efficiently and this is what the cutter

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.350 
efficiently and this is what the cutter
head<00:00:29.910> looks<00:00:30.210> like<00:00:30.269> up<00:00:31.170> into<00:00:31.590> a<00:00:31.969> kap-40<00:00:32.969> holder

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
head looks like up into a kap-40 holder

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:38.510 
head looks like up into a kap-40 holder
and<00:00:35.480> anyway<00:00:36.480> there's<00:00:36.719> a<00:00:36.950> screw<00:00:37.950> that<00:00:38.129> goes<00:00:38.250> in

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
and anyway there's a screw that goes in

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.369 
and anyway there's a screw that goes in
the<00:00:38.640> end<00:00:38.760> here<00:00:39.000> to<00:00:39.270> make<00:00:39.420> the<00:00:39.600> adjustments<00:00:40.200> for

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
the end here to make the adjustments for

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.740 
the end here to make the adjustments for
adjusting<00:00:40.860> the<00:00:40.890> size<00:00:41.190> now<00:00:42.180> what<00:00:42.329> we<00:00:42.420> did<00:00:42.570> was

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
adjusting the size now what we did was

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.369 
adjusting the size now what we did was
we<00:00:42.780> started<00:00:42.960> out<00:00:43.290> with<00:00:43.379> a<00:00:44.510> 5/16<00:00:45.510> fine<00:00:46.050> thread

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
we started out with a 5/16 fine thread

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:49.430 
we started out with a 5/16 fine thread
bolt<00:00:46.620> we<00:00:47.579> cut<00:00:47.789> the<00:00:47.910> head<00:00:48.030> off<00:00:48.090> and<00:00:48.930> now<00:00:49.110> we<00:00:49.170> need

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
bolt we cut the head off and now we need

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.220 
bolt we cut the head off and now we need
to<00:00:49.530> take<00:00:49.739> and<00:00:49.980> cut<00:00:50.010> some<00:00:50.399> holes<00:00:51.300> in<00:00:51.690> here<00:00:51.899> so

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
to take and cut some holes in here so

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.410 
to take and cut some holes in here so
that<00:00:52.260> we<00:00:52.410> can<00:00:52.559> adjust<00:00:52.739> this<00:00:53.129> thing<00:00:53.399> so<00:00:54.360> I'm

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
that we can adjust this thing so I'm

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.150 
that we can adjust this thing so I'm
going<00:00:54.600> to<00:00:54.629> show<00:00:54.809> you<00:00:54.870> how<00:00:54.989> that's<00:00:55.140> done<00:00:55.289> using

going to show you how that's done using

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.529 
going to show you how that's done using
a<00:00:56.399> simple<00:00:56.879> little<00:00:57.379> spin<00:00:58.379> indexer<00:00:58.980> here<00:00:59.539> this

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
a simple little spin indexer here this

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.360 
a simple little spin indexer here this
is<00:01:00.690> a<00:01:00.719> real<00:01:00.960> handy<00:01:01.230> little<00:01:01.379> tool<00:01:01.649> space<00:01:02.219> show

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
is a real handy little tool space show

for you guys that are home machinist
works<00:01:05.610> really<00:01:05.880> well<00:01:08.030> I'm<00:01:09.030> going<00:01:09.299> to<00:01:09.360> load<00:01:09.510> up

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
works really well I'm going to load up

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.950 
works really well I'm going to load up
the<00:01:09.780> part<00:01:10.049> here

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.109 

you<00:01:13.960> don't<00:01:14.140> have<00:01:14.320> to<00:01:14.499> be<00:01:14.619> real<00:01:15.549> critical<00:01:15.999> as

00:01:16.109 --> 00:01:16.119 
you don't have to be real critical as

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:19.289 
you don't have to be real critical as
far<00:01:16.420> as<00:01:16.569> the<00:01:17.140> X<00:01:17.409> direction<00:01:18.009> the<00:01:18.579> Y<00:01:18.759> direction

00:01:19.289 --> 00:01:19.299 
far as the X direction the Y direction

00:01:19.299 --> 00:01:24.569 
far as the X direction the Y direction
you<00:01:19.420> do<00:01:19.600> need<00:01:19.810> to<00:01:19.899> eat<00:01:19.929> that<00:01:20.200> centered<00:01:22.500> VR<00:01:23.579> tool

00:01:24.569 --> 00:01:24.579 
you do need to eat that centered VR tool

00:01:24.579 --> 00:01:27.840 
you do need to eat that centered VR tool
down<00:01:25.799> and<00:01:26.799> then<00:01:27.039> we'll<00:01:27.159> make<00:01:27.250> a<00:01:27.310> small

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:27.850 
down and then we'll make a small

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:30.389 
down and then we'll make a small
adjustment<00:01:28.090> here<00:01:28.719> to<00:01:28.840> get<00:01:28.990> the<00:01:29.200> hole<00:01:30.039> so

00:01:30.389 --> 00:01:30.399 
adjustment here to get the hole so

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:32.999 
adjustment here to get the hole so
that's<00:01:30.609> centered<00:01:30.909> here<00:01:31.090> in<00:01:31.179> the<00:01:31.240> middle<00:01:32.009> and

00:01:32.999 --> 00:01:33.009 
that's centered here in the middle and

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:37.410 
that's centered here in the middle and
now<00:01:33.130> let's<00:01:33.369> break<00:01:33.670> it<00:01:34.140> and<00:01:35.909> that<00:01:36.909> we'll<00:01:37.090> do<00:01:37.359> is

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:37.420 
now let's break it and that we'll do is

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:41.219 
now let's break it and that we'll do is
we'll<00:01:37.599> take<00:01:37.840> our<00:01:39.509> countersink<00:01:40.509> and<00:01:40.719> touch<00:01:40.929> off

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:41.229 
we'll take our countersink and touch off

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:44.749 
we'll take our countersink and touch off
and<00:01:41.560> we're<00:01:41.679> going<00:01:41.799> to<00:01:41.890> zero<00:01:42.250> out<00:01:42.310> our<00:01:43.200> Z<00:01:44.200> on

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
and we're going to zero out our Z on

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:52.819 
and we're going to zero out our Z on
machine<00:01:46.079> and<00:01:47.079> throughout<00:01:47.979> the<00:01:48.340> X<00:01:51.239> all<00:01:52.239> right

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
machine and throughout the X all right

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.749 
machine and throughout the X all right
now<00:01:53.829> we're<00:01:53.950> going<00:01:54.039> to<00:01:54.099> be<00:01:54.219> drilling<00:01:54.459> down

00:01:54.749 --> 00:01:54.759 
now we're going to be drilling down

00:01:54.759 --> 00:02:40.990 
now we're going to be drilling down
about<00:01:55.119> 150<00:01:55.719> thousands<00:01:56.319> from<00:01:56.890> this<00:01:57.159> point

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:41.000 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.420 

I<00:02:41.260> reset<00:02:42.260> my<00:02:42.290> ex<00:02:42.830> so<00:02:43.550> that<00:02:43.850> are<00:02:44.780> my<00:02:45.170> Z<00:02:45.440> rather<00:02:45.620> so

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:46.430 
I reset my ex so that are my Z rather so

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:47.950 
I reset my ex so that are my Z rather so
that<00:02:46.550> I<00:02:46.580> can<00:02:46.730> come<00:02:46.910> down<00:02:46.940> to<00:02:47.120> the<00:02:47.330> same<00:02:47.600> point

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:47.960 
that I can come down to the same point

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:55.710 
that I can come down to the same point
on<00:02:48.260> the<00:02:49.190> backside<00:02:49.930> this<00:02:50.930> indexer<00:02:54.100> it's

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:55.720 
on the backside this indexer it's

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:59.380 
on the backside this indexer it's
graduated<00:02:56.720> in<00:02:56.780> degrees<00:02:57.170> and<00:02:58.180> we're<00:02:59.180> going<00:02:59.300> to

00:02:59.380 --> 00:02:59.390 
graduated in degrees and we're going to

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:00.810 
graduated in degrees and we're going to
be<00:02:59.450> doing<00:02:59.630> here<00:02:59.990> is<00:03:00.230> we're<00:03:00.320> going<00:03:00.440> to<00:03:00.530> be

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:00.820 
be doing here is we're going to be

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:06.640 
be doing here is we're going to be
turning<00:03:01.820> this<00:03:01.940> thing<00:03:02.000> from<00:03:02.840> zero<00:03:05.440> over<00:03:06.440> to

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:06.650 
turning this thing from zero over to

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:14.860 
turning this thing from zero over to
ninety<00:03:09.160> I'll<00:03:10.160> shove<00:03:10.430> our<00:03:10.550> pin<00:03:10.790> back<00:03:11.000> in<00:03:13.870> right

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:14.870 
ninety I'll shove our pin back in right

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:18.670 
ninety I'll shove our pin back in right
there<00:03:15.170> and<00:03:16.420> what<00:03:17.420> I've<00:03:17.540> done<00:03:17.750> here<00:03:17.810> to<00:03:18.290> speed

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:18.680 
there and what I've done here to speed

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:21.070 
there and what I've done here to speed
myself<00:03:19.130> up<00:03:19.340> a<00:03:19.430> little<00:03:19.580> bit<00:03:19.730> as<00:03:19.880> I've<00:03:20.510> taken<00:03:20.720> a

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:21.080 
myself up a little bit as I've taken a

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:24.610 
myself up a little bit as I've taken a
marker<00:03:21.800> and<00:03:22.270> politico<00:03:23.270> here<00:03:23.450> at<00:03:23.540> 90<00:03:23.810> degrees<00:03:24.140> 1
