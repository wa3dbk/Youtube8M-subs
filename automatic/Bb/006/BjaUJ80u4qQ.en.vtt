00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
something I think and create a bit more

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.780 
something I think and create a bit more
a<00:01:15.600> bit<00:01:15.720> more<00:01:16.110> and<00:01:16.430> what<00:01:17.430> you've<00:01:17.520> gotta<00:01:17.700> learn

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
a bit more and what you've gotta learn

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.240 
a bit more and what you've gotta learn
is<00:01:18.000> that<00:01:18.060> you<00:01:18.150> can't<00:01:18.299> really<00:01:18.360> do<00:01:18.630> that<00:01:18.689> because

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:19.250 
is that you can't really do that because

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:23.960 
is that you can't really do that because
it's<00:01:20.250> not<00:01:20.400> good<00:01:20.610> but<00:01:21.740> and<00:01:22.740> I'm<00:01:23.490> happy<00:01:23.850> I'm
