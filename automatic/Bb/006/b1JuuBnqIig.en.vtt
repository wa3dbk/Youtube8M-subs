00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:09.559
 the franchise of l has not been the most 

00:00:06.649 --> 00:00:11.600
 successful in terms of video games the series 

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:14.030
 of him in versus predator was fine 

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:16.610
 but the lyon without fe station in inmates 

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:18.770
 10 and especially the yen is colonial 

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:20.779
 martins really destroyed our 

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:23.000
 enthusiasm but now we have reasons 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:25.279
 well-founded to be excited about 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.250
 again here are the 5 good reasons 

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:30.250
 because the link in your review will be 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:30.250
 amazing 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:38.040
 yoga and his injury goes back to the roots 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:39.570
 of the series and it is a fight for 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.489
 survival in a spaceship 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.800
 abandoned where you are 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:45.239
 prisoner with a mail that is more lethal 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.760
 that anything you have 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:52.460
 experienced does not carry super weapons by 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.460
 so the best thing is to be terrified 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:58.059
 the in colonial marines was a south was the 

00:00:55.839 --> 00:01:00.039
 color and located the enea franchise 

00:00:58.059 --> 00:01:03.609
 where players must shoot 

00:01:00.039 --> 00:01:05.680
 hordes of ehlers over and over again but the 

00:01:03.609 --> 00:01:08.710
 inai selection is a horror game and 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:10.299
 survival as amnesia and outlast in 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:12.490
 most of the game you do not have so 

00:01:10.299 --> 00:01:14.830
 even a weapon and you can only create 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:17.670
 distractions or cheating to deceive the 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:17.670
 bastard to him 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.840
 for the development of the inga isolation 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:28.170
 the developers are watching the 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.910
 original movie again and again every 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.030
 object in the game is based on the 

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:34.440
 spaceship that visited a replay 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:36.030
 even the static of the screens of 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:38.610
 television was extracted from the 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:41.960
 real vhs recorders to add 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.960
 authenticity to the game 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:52.770
 one of the things that have said outlast 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:55.200
 do mine is to generate tension and provide 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.480
 unexpected situations in helena 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:00.060
 insulation you need to be sure that 

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:02.690
 you move without making any noise and without 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.690
 To be seen 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:14.030
 at the same time you are continuously 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:16.819
 watching your scanner to see when 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:18.709
 may be the damn aerate the yen was 

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:20.780
 programmed so that each 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:25.000
 Situation moment situation will be 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:25.000
 different for each game session 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:32.270
 as a community 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:39.200
 fans have elena movies 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:41.360
 I had high hopes for the games 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:42.890
 based on the franchise of great up 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:44.870
 the moment everything has been in vain 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:47.510
 but every promise of a new game of 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:49.820
 the yen makes us anxious again 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:51.680
 success of amnesia and outlast shows that 

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:53.560
 it is possible to create a survival game 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:56.090
 jordÃ¡ where the players are 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:57.770
 absolutely vulnerable and now it's the 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:00.170
 moment for developers to 

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:01.880
 creative assembly fulfill the promise and 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:05.830
 bring us the game that we have been 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:05.830
 waiting all these years 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:11.819
 the test box replay
