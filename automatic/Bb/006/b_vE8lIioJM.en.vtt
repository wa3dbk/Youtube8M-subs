Kevin O'Shea has his just Japan podcast
and<00:00:55.260> he<00:00:55.890> started<00:00:56.280> using<00:00:56.430> a<00:00:57.079> blue<00:00:58.100> microphone<00:00:59.100> I

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.760 
and he started using a blue microphone I
really<00:01:00.180> got<00:01:00.329> to<00:01:00.449> thinking<00:01:00.780> maybe<00:01:00.960> she<00:01:01.590> should

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
really got to thinking maybe she should

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.130 
really got to thinking maybe she should
get<00:01:01.949> me<00:01:02.219> a<00:01:02.480> microphone<00:01:03.480> to<00:01:03.719> do<00:01:03.930> better

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
get me a microphone to do better

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.920 
get me a microphone to do better
voiceovers<00:01:04.949> do<00:01:05.400> better<00:01:05.820> things<00:01:06.150> with<00:01:06.540> the

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
voiceovers do better things with the

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:12.649 
voiceovers do better things with the
podcast<00:01:07.530> and<00:01:08.330> I<00:01:09.330> really<00:01:10.490> agreed<00:01:11.490> that<00:01:11.909> it<00:01:12.450> was

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
podcast and I really agreed that it was

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.270 
podcast and I really agreed that it was
the<00:01:12.810> time<00:01:12.990> because<00:01:13.200> i've<00:01:13.650> been<00:01:13.680> using<00:01:14.040> a

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
the time because i've been using a

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.789 
the time because i've been using a
microphone<00:01:14.610> since<00:01:15.270> 2008<00:01:16.229> i<00:01:16.259> hadn't<00:01:16.619> upgraded

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
microphone since 2008 i hadn't upgraded

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.359 
microphone since 2008 i hadn't upgraded
so<00:01:17.369> this<00:01:17.580> would<00:01:17.700> be<00:01:17.729> the<00:01:17.909> first<00:01:17.939> upgrade<00:01:18.509> in

00:01:19.359 --> 00:01:19.369 
so this would be the first upgrade in

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:22.520 
so this would be the first upgrade in
sound<00:01:20.369> technology<00:01:20.549> since<00:01:21.360> then<00:01:21.570> so<00:01:21.960> i<00:01:21.990> opted

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
sound technology since then so i opted

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.999 
sound technology since then so i opted
to<00:01:22.710> get<00:01:22.890> the<00:01:23.369> Yeti<00:01:23.880> now<00:01:24.240> i<00:01:24.630> had<00:01:25.560> several

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
to get the Yeti now i had several

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:27.590 
to get the Yeti now i had several
different<00:01:26.310> options<00:01:26.430> and<00:01:26.909> we<00:01:27.030> talked<00:01:27.390> it<00:01:27.509> over

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
different options and we talked it over

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.609 
different options and we talked it over
but<00:01:28.470> really<00:01:28.979> i<00:01:29.009> settled<00:01:29.909> on<00:01:30.060> the<00:01:30.689> Yeti<00:01:31.020> because

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
but really i settled on the Yeti because

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:36.800 
but really i settled on the Yeti because
of<00:01:31.979> its<00:01:32.549> varying<00:01:33.320> sound<00:01:34.320> profiles<00:01:35.189> now<00:01:36.090> you

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
of its varying sound profiles now you

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
because i've been using it already but i

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.359 
because i've been using it already but i
really<00:01:45.000> wanted<00:01:45.329> to<00:01:45.420> do<00:01:45.570> a<00:01:45.600> video<00:01:45.930> showing<00:01:46.560> you

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369

the<00:01:48.030> comparison<00:01:48.420> between<00:01:49.110> the<00:01:49.470> different

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
the comparison between the different

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.289 
the comparison between the different
sound<00:01:50.220> modes<00:01:50.460> there's<00:01:50.640> actually<00:01:50.970> four

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
sound modes there's actually four

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:54.410 
sound modes there's actually four
there's<00:01:51.509> a<00:01:51.570> stereo<00:01:52.079> omnidirectional<00:01:53.420> carotid

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
there's a stereo omnidirectional carotid

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.289 
there's a stereo omnidirectional carotid
and<00:01:54.630> bi-directional<00:01:55.280> now<00:01:56.280> right<00:01:56.700> now<00:01:56.969> I<00:01:57.000> am

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
and bi-directional now right now I am

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.990 
and bi-directional now right now I am
actually<00:01:57.689> using<00:01:58.049> the<00:01:58.530> carotid<00:01:59.310> so<00:01:59.520> basically

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
actually using the carotid so basically

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.749 
actually using the carotid so basically
all<00:02:00.030> the<00:02:00.329> sound<00:02:00.600> is<00:02:00.840> the<00:02:01.409> microphone<00:02:01.860> is<00:02:01.890> keyed

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
all the sound is the microphone is keyed

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:06.459 
all the sound is the microphone is keyed
towards<00:02:03.689> my<00:02:04.170> voice<00:02:04.590> and<00:02:05.520> everything<00:02:05.880> behind

00:02:06.459 --> 00:02:06.469 
towards my voice and everything behind

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:09.680 
towards my voice and everything behind
the<00:02:07.469> microphone<00:02:07.680> really<00:02:08.429> is<00:02:08.580> minimized<00:02:09.149> so

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
the microphone really is minimized so

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.410 
the microphone really is minimized so
what<00:02:09.929> I<00:02:09.959> thought<00:02:10.229> I'd<00:02:10.289> do<00:02:10.619> is<00:02:10.649> play<00:02:11.640> some<00:02:11.970> music

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
what I thought I'd do is play some music

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.470 
what I thought I'd do is play some music
some<00:02:12.810> music

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
some music

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:16.290 
some music

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:21.940 
the microphone modes and talk so you can

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:24.660 
the microphone modes and talk so you can
actually<00:02:22.090> hear<00:02:22.900> the<00:02:23.260> difference<00:02:23.680> so<00:02:23.860> this<00:02:24.430> is

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670

I'm<00:02:41.650> already<00:02:42.099> talking<00:02:42.340> louder<00:02:42.790> so<00:02:43.409> for<00:02:44.409> the

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:44.980 
I'm already talking louder so for the

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:47.190 
I'm already talking louder so for the
imac<00:02:45.370> i<00:02:45.610> have<00:02:45.819> this<00:02:46.000> at<00:02:46.269> about<00:02:46.750> fifty<00:02:47.170> percent

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:47.200 
imac i have this at about fifty percent

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.949 
imac i have this at about fifty percent
volume<00:02:48.190> and<00:02:48.640> I'm<00:02:49.120> going<00:02:49.269> to<00:02:49.299> keep<00:02:49.510> the<00:02:49.780> volume

00:02:49.949 --> 00:02:49.959 
volume and I'm going to keep the volume

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:53.880 
volume and I'm going to keep the volume
for<00:02:50.379> the<00:02:50.440> imac<00:02:50.849> the<00:02:51.849> same<00:02:52.150> so<00:02:52.660> this<00:02:53.260> is<00:02:53.560> the

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:53.890 
for the imac the same so this is the

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:57.080 
for the imac the same so this is the
carotid<00:02:54.519> mode<00:02:54.819> so<00:02:55.209> you<00:02:55.239> should<00:02:56.019> hear<00:02:56.650> me

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
carotid mode so you should hear me

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:01.259 
carotid mode so you should hear me
predominantly<00:02:58.090> instead<00:02:59.019> of<00:02:59.260> me<00:02:59.799> versus<00:03:00.760> the

00:03:01.259 --> 00:03:01.269 
predominantly instead of me versus the

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:03.569 
predominantly instead of me versus the
sound<00:03:01.780> so<00:03:02.470> i'm<00:03:02.709> gonna<00:03:02.829> go<00:03:02.920> ahead<00:03:03.010> and<00:03:03.190> change

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:03.579 
sound so i'm gonna go ahead and change

00:03:03.579 --> 00:03:06.509 
sound so i'm gonna go ahead and change
the<00:03:03.879> microphone<00:03:04.450> to<00:03:05.280> bi-directional<00:03:06.280> so<00:03:06.430> it'd

00:03:06.509 --> 00:03:06.519 
the microphone to bi-directional so it'd

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:19.470 
the microphone to bi-directional so it'd
be<00:03:06.579> me<00:03:07.000> and<00:03:07.239> the<00:03:08.190> computer<00:03:11.250> well<00:03:12.250> that's<00:03:12.430> game

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:19.480 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:22.460 

there<00:03:20.110> we<00:03:20.230> go<00:03:20.379> so<00:03:20.980> this<00:03:21.280> is<00:03:21.310> bi-directional<00:03:21.670> so

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
there we go so this is bi-directional so

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:24.690 
there we go so this is bi-directional so
predominantly<00:03:23.470> the<00:03:23.739> microphone<00:03:24.159> is<00:03:24.190> still

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:24.700 
predominantly the microphone is still

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:27.539 
predominantly the microphone is still
more<00:03:25.510> towards<00:03:25.900> me<00:03:26.110> but<00:03:26.290> you<00:03:26.470> hear<00:03:26.799> a<00:03:26.830> lot<00:03:27.250> more

00:03:27.539 --> 00:03:27.549 
more towards me but you hear a lot more

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:30.600 
more towards me but you hear a lot more
sound<00:03:28.209> coming<00:03:28.930> from<00:03:29.080> the<00:03:29.739> computer<00:03:29.950> at<00:03:30.430> this

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:30.610 
sound coming from the computer at this

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:32.399 
sound coming from the computer at this
point<00:03:30.959> so<00:03:31.959> there<00:03:32.140> you<00:03:32.170> have<00:03:32.290> it

00:03:32.399 --> 00:03:32.409 
point so there you have it

00:03:32.409 --> 00:03:34.949 
point so there you have it
bi-directional<00:03:33.040> mode<00:03:34.030> now<00:03:34.599> I'm<00:03:34.720> going<00:03:34.870> to

00:03:34.949 --> 00:03:34.959 
bi-directional mode now I'm going to

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:37.830 
bi-directional mode now I'm going to
switch<00:03:35.170> things<00:03:35.200> to<00:03:36.060> omnidirectional<00:03:37.060> mode

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:37.840 
switch things to omnidirectional mode

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:40.800 
switch things to omnidirectional mode
meaning<00:03:38.080> everything<00:03:39.360> everything<00:03:40.360> including

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:40.810 
meaning everything everything including

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:52.830 
meaning everything everything including
the<00:03:40.930> kitchen<00:03:40.959> sink<00:03:50.819> okay<00:03:51.819> so<00:03:51.879> this<00:03:52.480> is

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:52.840 
the kitchen sink okay so this is

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:56.030 
the kitchen sink okay so this is
omnidirectional<00:03:53.470> mode<00:03:54.099> again<00:03:54.819> it<00:03:55.299> picks<00:03:55.840> up

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.040 
omnidirectional mode again it picks up

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:58.770 
omnidirectional mode again it picks up
360<00:03:57.040> and<00:03:57.370> while<00:03:57.730> the<00:03:57.910> music<00:03:58.239> is<00:03:58.420> a<00:03:58.450> little<00:03:58.660> bit

00:03:58.770 --> 00:03:58.780 
360 and while the music is a little bit

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:00.869 
360 and while the music is a little bit
softer<00:03:59.290> here<00:03:59.470> at<00:03:59.560> this<00:03:59.650> portion<00:04:00.129> of<00:04:00.310> the<00:04:00.370> song

00:04:00.869 --> 00:04:00.879 
softer here at this portion of the song

00:04:00.879 --> 00:04:04.680 
softer here at this portion of the song
you<00:04:01.450> get<00:04:02.109> an<00:04:02.200> idea<00:04:02.739> that<00:04:03.250> it<00:04:03.609> still<00:04:04.000> isn't<00:04:04.540> as

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:04.690 
you get an idea that it still isn't as

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:07.860 
you get an idea that it still isn't as
nice<00:04:05.109> as<00:04:05.470> the<00:04:05.980> carotid<00:04:06.730> and<00:04:06.910> finally<00:04:07.599> the

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:07.870 
nice as the carotid and finally the

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:15.000 
nice as the carotid and finally the
stereo<00:04:08.500> mode<00:04:12.840> so<00:04:13.840> this<00:04:14.019> is<00:04:14.049> stereo<00:04:14.590> mode<00:04:14.799> I've

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:15.010 
stereo mode so this is stereo mode I've

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:16.949 
stereo mode so this is stereo mode I've
pretty<00:04:15.430> much<00:04:15.519> tried<00:04:15.640> to<00:04:16.120> keep<00:04:16.299> the<00:04:16.479> microphone

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:16.959 
pretty much tried to keep the microphone

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:21.509 
pretty much tried to keep the microphone
in<00:04:17.109> the<00:04:17.139> same<00:04:18.720> position<00:04:20.190> that's<00:04:21.190> what<00:04:21.489> she

00:04:21.509 --> 00:04:21.519 
in the same position that's what she

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:24.240 
in the same position that's what she
said<00:04:22.270> hey<00:04:22.930> wait<00:04:23.110> the<00:04:23.320> same<00:04:23.530> position<00:04:24.010> so<00:04:24.130> you

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:24.250 
said hey wait the same position so you

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:25.680 
said hey wait the same position so you
can<00:04:24.370> kind<00:04:24.550> of<00:04:24.669> hear<00:04:25.030> that<00:04:25.270> there's<00:04:25.450> still<00:04:25.539> a

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:25.690 
can kind of hear that there's still a

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:27.930 
can kind of hear that there's still a
lot<00:04:25.840> of<00:04:25.870> background<00:04:26.229> noise<00:04:26.800> so<00:04:27.610> I'm<00:04:27.700> gonna<00:04:27.789> go

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:27.940 
lot of background noise so I'm gonna go

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:41.150 
lot of background noise so I'm gonna go
ahead<00:04:28.030> and<00:04:28.120> switch<00:04:28.389> things<00:04:28.630> back<00:04:28.870> to<00:04:29.080> carotid

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:41.160 

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:43.260 

alright<00:04:42.160> so<00:04:42.340> there<00:04:42.460> you<00:04:42.520> have<00:04:42.550> it<00:04:42.670> this<00:04:43.030> is<00:04:43.180> the

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:43.270 
alright so there you have it this is the

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:45.930 
alright so there you have it this is the
carotid<00:04:43.660> mode<00:04:43.900> once<00:04:44.260> more<00:04:44.950> and<00:04:45.400> you<00:04:45.610> should

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:45.940 
carotid mode once more and you should

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:49.140 
carotid mode once more and you should
hear<00:04:46.240> the<00:04:46.360> sound<00:04:46.630> dip<00:04:47.050> down<00:04:47.380> from<00:04:48.370> the<00:04:48.790> music

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:49.150 
hear the sound dip down from the music

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:51.240 
hear the sound dip down from the music
as<00:04:49.330> it<00:04:49.540> builds<00:04:49.840> up<00:04:50.140> in<00:04:50.380> the<00:04:50.530> background<00:04:51.040> so

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:51.250 
as it builds up in the background so

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:55.500 
as it builds up in the background so
