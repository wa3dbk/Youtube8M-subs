00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
Panorama paper and I've cut this to 11

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:33.920 
Panorama paper and I've cut this to 11
and<00:00:28.949> 3/4<00:00:29.640> by<00:00:30.480> 4<00:00:30.960> and<00:00:31.320> 3/4<00:00:32.189> and<00:00:32.489> I've<00:00:33.090> used<00:00:33.540> some

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
quarter of an inch bigger so we have 12

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.860 
quarter of an inch bigger so we have 12
inches<00:00:39.899> by<00:00:40.649> 5<00:00:41.040> inches<00:00:41.070> and<00:00:41.879> you're<00:00:42.390> just<00:00:42.629> going

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
inches by 5 inches and you're just going

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.260 
inches by 5 inches and you're just going
to<00:00:42.930> glue<00:00:43.290> those<00:00:43.469> together<00:00:43.800> and<00:00:44.309> you'll<00:00:45.000> use<00:00:45.239> a

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
to glue those together and you'll use a

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.350 
to glue those together and you'll use a
circle<00:00:45.899> punch<00:00:46.200> to<00:00:46.710> create<00:00:47.160> the<00:00:47.850> piece<00:00:48.149> that

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
circle punch to create the piece that

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.200 
circle punch to create the piece that
you<00:00:48.480> can<00:00:48.690> hang<00:00:48.899> on<00:00:48.989> the<00:00:49.050> door<00:00:49.610> so<00:00:50.610> once<00:00:50.910> those

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
you can hang on the door so once those

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:52.910 
you can hang on the door so once those
are<00:00:51.420> adhered<00:00:51.809> together<00:00:52.020> you're<00:00:52.680> going<00:00:52.860> to

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
are adhered together you're going to

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.920 
are adhered together you're going to
create<00:00:53.160> the<00:00:53.489> pockets<00:00:54.260> so<00:00:55.260> the<00:00:55.739> back<00:00:55.949> pocket

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:56.930

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:31.130 
you only glue these back flaps because

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:34.750 
you only glue these back flaps because

took some straight scissors to make it

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:37.330 
took some straight scissors to make it
look<00:03:33.799> more<00:03:34.070> like<00:03:34.850> a<00:03:35.239> tag<00:03:36.010> so<00:03:37.010> you're<00:03:37.190> going<00:03:37.310> to

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:37.340 
look more like a tag so you're going to

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:39.610 
look more like a tag so you're going to
cut<00:03:37.609> individual<00:03:38.150> pieces<00:03:38.359> of<00:03:38.510> paper<00:03:38.810> you're

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:39.620 
cut individual pieces of paper you're

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:42.550 
cut individual pieces of paper you're
going<00:03:39.829> to<00:03:39.890> glue<00:03:40.160> that<00:03:40.190> down<00:03:40.730> when<00:03:41.510> I<00:03:41.540> fit<00:03:42.380> them

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:42.560 
going to glue that down when I fit them

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:44.140 
going to glue that down when I fit them
to<00:03:42.709> the<00:03:42.829> paper<00:03:43.040> I<00:03:43.190> like<00:03:43.489> to<00:03:43.640> have<00:03:43.790> a<00:03:43.820> tiny

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:44.150 
to the paper I like to have a tiny

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:46.390 
to the paper I like to have a tiny
little<00:03:44.329> border<00:03:45.019> so<00:03:45.590> you<00:03:45.650> can<00:03:45.920> kind<00:03:46.130> of<00:03:46.190> cut

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:46.400 
little border so you can kind of cut

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:48.160 
little border so you can kind of cut
them<00:03:46.549> to<00:03:46.760> size<00:03:46.790> if<00:03:47.209> you<00:03:47.359> like<00:03:47.570> that<00:03:47.810> or<00:03:47.989> if<00:03:48.049> you

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:48.170 
them to size if you like that or if you

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:49.599 
them to size if you like that or if you
don't<00:03:48.380> you<00:03:48.530> can<00:03:48.709> cut<00:03:48.920> it<00:03:49.010> right<00:03:49.190> to<00:03:49.370> the<00:03:49.459> edge

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:49.609 
don't you can cut it right to the edge

00:03:49.609 --> 00:03:52.240 
don't you can cut it right to the edge
again<00:03:50.420> you<00:03:50.750> can<00:03:50.930> use<00:03:51.049> scrap<00:03:51.410> papers<00:03:51.799> for<00:03:52.130> this

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:52.250 
again you can use scrap papers for this

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:54.910 
again you can use scrap papers for this
because<00:03:52.730> they<00:03:52.880> are<00:03:52.930> just<00:03:53.930> tiny<00:03:54.200> little<00:03:54.410> pieces

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:54.920 
because they are just tiny little pieces

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:57.580 
because they are just tiny little pieces
so<00:03:55.760> you<00:03:55.790> would<00:03:56.090> glue<00:03:56.359> that<00:03:56.540> down<00:03:56.870> I<00:03:57.350> took

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:57.590 
so you would glue that down I took

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:59.680 
so you would glue that down I took
another<00:03:58.280> piece<00:03:58.549> of<00:03:58.609> paper<00:03:58.910> and<00:03:59.209> I've<00:03:59.299> used<00:03:59.510> a

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:02.840 
scalloped edge you'd glue that down and

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:05.470
