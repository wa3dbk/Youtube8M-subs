00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:46.260 
other side is the end result as you
mentioned<00:04:42.240> basically<00:04:43.800> we<00:04:44.800> are<00:04:45.270> totally

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:46.270 
mentioned basically we are totally

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:47.540 
mentioned basically we are totally
different

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:47.550 
different

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:50.390 
different
in<00:04:47.759> a<00:04:47.910> way<00:04:48.120> that<00:04:48.780> our<00:04:48.960> apps<00:04:49.379> are<00:04:49.650> first<00:04:50.220> of<00:04:50.340> all

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:50.400 
in a way that our apps are first of all

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:54.110 
in a way that our apps are first of all
truly<00:04:50.699> native<00:04:51.060> and<00:04:51.949> what<00:04:52.949> they're<00:04:53.280> using<00:04:53.910> is

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:54.120 
truly native and what they're using is

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:58.999 
truly native and what they're using is
the<00:04:54.810> way<00:04:55.139> we<00:04:55.889> thought<00:04:56.159> that<00:04:57.680> publishers<00:04:58.680> will

00:04:58.999 --> 00:04:59.009 
the way we thought that publishers will

00:04:59.009 --> 00:05:03.050 
the way we thought that publishers will
like<00:04:59.250> to<00:04:59.610> have<00:04:59.759> an<00:05:00.360> engagement<00:05:01.220> part<00:05:02.220> of<00:05:02.490> the

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:03.060 
like to have an engagement part of the

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:06.080 
like to have an engagement part of the
app<00:05:03.180> so<00:05:03.870> when<00:05:04.560> I<00:05:04.590> say<00:05:04.800> engagement<00:05:05.370> this<00:05:05.849> means

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:06.090 
app so when I say engagement this means

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:10.089 
app so when I say engagement this means
that<00:05:06.330> the<00:05:06.629> publisher<00:05:07.310> can<00:05:08.310> post<00:05:08.669> through<00:05:09.240> that

00:05:10.089 --> 00:05:10.099 
that the publisher can post through that

00:05:10.099 --> 00:05:13.159 
that the publisher can post through that
anyone<00:05:11.099> can<00:05:11.340> comment<00:05:11.699> and<00:05:12.120> interact<00:05:12.389> with<00:05:12.750> the

00:05:13.159 --> 00:05:13.169 
anyone can comment and interact with the

00:05:13.169 --> 00:05:15.800 
anyone can comment and interact with the
content<00:05:13.349> as<00:05:13.770> it<00:05:14.370> would<00:05:14.669> be<00:05:14.909> done<00:05:15.330> on<00:05:15.360> the

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:15.810 
content as it would be done on the

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:17.899 
content as it would be done on the
website<00:05:16.199> and<00:05:16.379> the<00:05:17.099> other<00:05:17.250> part<00:05:17.520> is<00:05:17.610> the<00:05:17.759> push

00:05:17.899 --> 00:05:17.909 
website and the other part is the push

00:05:17.909 --> 00:05:19.730 
website and the other part is the push
notifications<00:05:18.569> so<00:05:18.720> each<00:05:19.319> and<00:05:19.530> every

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:19.740 
notifications so each and every

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:21.710

publisher<00:05:20.400> will<00:05:20.880> have<00:05:21.030> the<00:05:21.150> ability<00:05:21.240> to

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:21.720 
publisher will have the ability to

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:24.050 
publisher will have the ability to
utilize<00:05:22.560> that<00:05:22.590> the<00:05:23.039> push<00:05:23.340> notification<00:05:23.909> and
