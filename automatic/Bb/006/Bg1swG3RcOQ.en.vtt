you're not ready for an engagement that

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:54.889 
you're not ready for an engagement that
does<00:00:53.309> sound<00:00:53.550> pretty<00:00:53.820> overpowered<00:00:54.239> in<00:00:54.660> my

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
does sound pretty overpowered in my

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.020 
does sound pretty overpowered in my
opinion<00:00:55.350> 343<00:00:56.070> heads<00:00:56.430> so<00:00:56.640> that<00:00:56.789> they<00:00:56.879> are<00:00:57.000> going

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
opinion 343 heads so that they are going

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.060 
opinion 343 heads so that they are going
to<00:00:57.390> tweak<00:00:57.719> various<00:00:58.440> items<00:00:58.649> in<00:00:58.949> the<00:00:59.039> game

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
to tweak various items in the game

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.470 
to tweak various items in the game
though<00:01:00.020> next<00:01:01.020> topic<00:01:01.289> the<00:01:01.949> DMR<00:01:02.609> is<00:01:02.879> actually<00:01:03.449> a

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
though next topic the DMR is actually a

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.329 
though next topic the DMR is actually a
very<00:01:03.719> powerful<00:01:04.080> weapon<00:01:04.650> from<00:01:04.799> what<00:01:05.010> I<00:01:05.040> have

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
very powerful weapon from what I have

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.700 
very powerful weapon from what I have
seen<00:01:05.369> I<00:01:05.939> actually<00:01:06.420> kind<00:01:06.900> of<00:01:06.990> might<00:01:07.229> use<00:01:07.500> the

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
seen I actually kind of might use the

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.800 
seen I actually kind of might use the
DMR<00:01:08.159> first<00:01:08.490> in<00:01:08.729> the<00:01:08.820> various<00:01:09.150> gameplays<00:01:09.600> I've

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
DMR first in the various gameplays I've

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.750 
DMR first in the various gameplays I've
seen<00:01:10.049> the<00:01:10.200> DMR<00:01:10.650> has<00:01:10.890> been<00:01:11.070> able<00:01:11.189> to<00:01:11.310> take<00:01:11.549> care

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
seen the DMR has been able to take care

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.240 
seen the DMR has been able to take care
of<00:01:11.820> enemies<00:01:12.180> with<00:01:12.840> strong<00:01:13.260> power<00:01:13.500> and<00:01:13.890> very

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
of enemies with strong power and very

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.760 
of enemies with strong power and very
quickly<00:01:14.670> and<00:01:15.030> with<00:01:15.450> precision<00:01:15.840> the<00:01:16.409> bloom

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
quickly and with precision the bloom

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.710 
quickly and with precision the bloom
isn't<00:01:17.189> as<00:01:17.310> strong<00:01:17.640> as<00:01:17.880> it<00:01:18.030> was<00:01:18.060> in<00:01:18.390> Halo<00:01:18.689> Reach

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
isn't as strong as it was in Halo Reach

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.120 
isn't as strong as it was in Halo Reach
so<00:01:19.110> I<00:01:19.170> think<00:01:19.229> that<00:01:19.439> that<00:01:19.590> is<00:01:19.710> definitely<00:01:20.070> a

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
so I think that that is definitely a

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.730 
so I think that that is definitely a
plus<00:01:20.460> for<00:01:20.759> the<00:01:20.880> weapon<00:01:21.240> the<00:01:21.720> BR<00:01:22.110> for<00:01:22.590> some

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
plus for the weapon the BR for some

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.679 
plus for the weapon the BR for some
reason<00:01:23.070> the<00:01:23.159> BR<00:01:23.460> seems<00:01:23.759> a<00:01:23.850> little<00:01:24.000> strange<00:01:24.390> or

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
reason the BR seems a little strange or

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.300 
reason the BR seems a little strange or
off<00:01:24.900> to<00:01:25.259> me<00:01:25.380> for<00:01:25.590> some<00:01:25.710> reason<00:01:25.770> it<00:01:26.070> doesn't

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
off to me for some reason it doesn't

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.520 
off to me for some reason it doesn't
seem<00:01:26.580> right<00:01:26.909> but<00:01:27.150> the<00:01:27.509> DMR<00:01:27.960> makes<00:01:28.170> me<00:01:28.320> feel

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
seem right but the DMR makes me feel

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.060 
seem right but the DMR makes me feel
right<00:01:28.860> at<00:01:28.920> home<00:01:30.140> next<00:01:31.140> topic<00:01:31.380> the<00:01:31.680> sniper

of<00:01:41.610> it<00:01:41.700> it's<00:01:42.119> big<00:01:42.479> and<00:01:42.689> boxy<00:01:42.869> yes<00:01:43.500> but<00:01:43.770> it<00:01:43.890> still

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
of it it's big and boxy yes but it still

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.069 
of it it's big and boxy yes but it still
is<00:01:44.280> a<00:01:44.310> halo<00:01:44.549> sniper<00:01:44.939> rifle<00:01:45.360> isn't<00:01:45.720> that<00:01:45.869> bad

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
is a halo sniper rifle isn't that bad

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:47.780 
is a halo sniper rifle isn't that bad
it's<00:01:46.290> just<00:01:46.530> an<00:01:46.680> aesthetic<00:01:46.890> it<00:01:47.520> doesn't

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
it's just an aesthetic it doesn't

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.600 
it's just an aesthetic it doesn't
actually<00:01:47.970> direct<00:01:48.630> gameplay<00:01:49.590> so<00:01:49.649> not<00:01:50.460> much

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
actually direct gameplay so not much

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.580 
actually direct gameplay so not much
there<00:01:50.909> it<00:01:51.149> is<00:01:51.450> similar<00:01:51.780> to<00:01:52.020> the<00:01:52.110> halo<00:01:52.409> reach

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590

mode though next topic the new helmet
look<00:03:33.840> when<00:03:34.050> I<00:03:34.170> think<00:03:34.470> about<00:03:34.560> them<00:03:34.860> well

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
look when I think about them well

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:36.979 
look when I think about them well
personally<00:03:35.550> the<00:03:35.820> new<00:03:35.940> helmets<00:03:36.300> look<00:03:36.480> kind<00:03:36.840> of

00:03:36.979 --> 00:03:36.989 
personally the new helmets look kind of

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:39.199 
personally the new helmets look kind of
big<00:03:37.560> they're<00:03:38.070> very<00:03:38.220> bulky<00:03:38.610> and<00:03:38.820> the<00:03:38.940> visor

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:39.209 
big they're very bulky and the visor

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:41.870 
big they're very bulky and the visor
seem<00:03:39.750> very<00:03:40.050> small<00:03:40.709> on<00:03:40.980> them<00:03:41.190> even<00:03:41.700> though<00:03:41.760> that

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:41.880 
seem very small on them even though that

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:43.550 
seem very small on them even though that
they<00:03:42.000> do<00:03:42.060> have<00:03:42.360> cool<00:03:42.660> designs<00:03:43.110> I'm<00:03:43.410> not

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560 
they do have cool designs I'm not

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:45.530 
they do have cool designs I'm not
exactly<00:03:43.950> sure<00:03:44.160> how<00:03:44.640> the<00:03:44.700> Spartans<00:03:45.360> could

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:45.540 
exactly sure how the Spartans could

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:47.000 
exactly sure how the Spartans could
actually<00:03:45.690> see<00:03:46.110> out<00:03:46.320> of<00:03:46.350> them<00:03:46.560> because<00:03:46.709> the

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:47.010 
actually see out of them because the

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:49.370 
actually see out of them because the
visor<00:03:47.220> seems<00:03:47.700> so<00:03:47.940> tiny<00:03:48.269> but<00:03:48.570> yeah<00:03:49.110> I<00:03:49.140> do

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:49.380 
visor seems so tiny but yeah I do

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:51.199 
visor seems so tiny but yeah I do
actually<00:03:49.500> think<00:03:50.070> that<00:03:50.310> the<00:03:50.430> visors<00:03:50.850> and<00:03:50.880> the

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:51.209 
actually think that the visors and the

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:52.820 
actually think that the visors and the
helmets<00:03:51.570> overall<00:03:51.959> they<00:03:52.080> look<00:03:52.230> pretty<00:03:52.500> darn

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:52.830 
helmets overall they look pretty darn

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:54.860 
helmets overall they look pretty darn
cool<00:03:53.220> I<00:03:53.280> think<00:03:53.430> they're<00:03:54.209> definitely<00:03:54.420> a<00:03:54.660> step

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:54.870 
cool I think they're definitely a step

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:57.229 
cool I think they're definitely a step
up<00:03:54.930> from<00:03:55.230> the<00:03:55.380> halo<00:03:55.709> reach<00:03:56.010> their<00:03:56.820> kind<00:03:57.030> of<00:03:57.090> on

00:03:57.229 --> 00:03:57.239 
up from the halo reach their kind of on

00:03:57.239 --> 00:04:01.699 
up from the halo reach their kind of on
par<00:03:57.600> with<00:03:57.630> the<00:03:57.840> halo<00:03:58.200> 3<00:03:58.590> helmets<00:03:59.100> I<00:03:59.250> think<00:04:00.709> next

00:04:01.699 --> 00:04:01.709 
par with the halo 3 helmets I think next

topic the controller layouts are out and

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:06.680 
topic the controller layouts are out and
there's<00:04:04.140> a<00:04:04.200> lot<00:04:04.530> of<00:04:04.800> stuff<00:04:05.730> controversy<00:04:06.660> over

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:06.690 
there's a lot of stuff controversy over

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:08.660 
there's a lot of stuff controversy over
these<00:04:06.989> controller<00:04:07.410> layouts<00:04:07.739> mainly<00:04:08.519> because

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:08.670 
these controller layouts mainly because

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:10.850 
these controller layouts mainly because
it's<00:04:08.910> very<00:04:09.150> hard<00:04:09.450> for<00:04:09.540> 343<00:04:10.140> to<00:04:10.440> find<00:04:10.709> the

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:10.860 
it's very hard for 343 to find the

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:12.740 
it's very hard for 343 to find the

now that sprint is default they have to

now that sprint is default they have to

particularly<00:04:16.709> I<00:04:16.830> want<00:04:17.130> to<00:04:17.190> focus<00:04:17.370> on<00:04:17.640> bumper

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:18.150

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:22.440 
controller configuration that is very

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:23.960 
controller configuration that is very
interesting<00:04:22.950> in<00:04:23.100> that<00:04:23.130> they<00:04:23.310> switch<00:04:23.940> the

interesting in that they switch the

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:26.280 
grenade and armor ability button so the

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:27.620 
grenade and armor ability button so the
grenade<00:04:26.640> is<00:04:26.880> now<00:04:27.060> X

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:27.630

like that at all next topic the joint in

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:34.610 
like that at all next topic the joint in
progress<00:04:33.300> has<00:04:33.510> some<00:04:33.720> new<00:04:33.870> features<00:04:34.140> as

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:34.620 
progress has some new features as

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:36.740 
progress has some new features as
Frankie<00:04:35.130> has<00:04:35.310> revealed<00:04:35.670> there<00:04:36.240> was<00:04:36.390> a<00:04:36.420> feature

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:36.750 
Frankie has revealed there was a feature

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:38.210 
Frankie has revealed there was a feature
on<00:04:36.960> the<00:04:37.080> joint<00:04:37.290> progress<00:04:37.650> that<00:04:37.770> says<00:04:37.950> do<00:04:38.190> not

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:38.220 
on the joint progress that says do not

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:40.010 
on the joint progress that says do not
join<00:04:38.670> in<00:04:38.850> progress<00:04:39.300> so<00:04:39.480> that's<00:04:39.630> a<00:04:39.750> setting

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:40.020 
join in progress so that's a setting

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:41.180 
join in progress so that's a setting
that<00:04:40.080> you<00:04:40.170> can<00:04:40.350> put<00:04:40.500> on<00:04:40.590> the<00:04:40.620> game<00:04:40.860> so<00:04:41.040> I<00:04:41.070> think

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:41.190 
that you can put on the game so I think

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:43.220 
that you can put on the game so I think
we're<00:04:41.430> going<00:04:41.520> to<00:04:41.610> see<00:04:41.640> that<00:04:41.820> on<00:04:42.150> some<00:04:42.630> classic

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:43.230 
we're going to see that on some classic

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:46.070 
we're going to see that on some classic
halo<00:04:43.590> type<00:04:43.890> games<00:04:44.280> and<00:04:44.630> competitive<00:04:45.630> games<00:04:45.900> or

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:46.080
