00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:26.150
 good friends split fish set 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:30.500
 let's make a global video about this 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:33.230
 about this lead barium if it's true 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:34.579
 that then we are going to make videos of each 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:36.530
 one of the models but good 

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:38.449
 they commented in general why so much 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:40.100
 variety of lead because there are many 

00:00:38.449 --> 00:00:43.530
 people who do not understand with many 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:46.780
 amateurs who do not understand and see 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:50.050
 they see too many similar in all these 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:53.020
 types of promo models but yes that is 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:56.350
 true that everyone has their reason for 

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:59.560
 be its your reason to use it in each 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:02.080
 moment and especially also adapting 

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:03.580
 to the bars to the street stirrups that 

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:05.530
 we have available now to the 

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:07.720
 selling either the fishing leader here 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:10.420
 punto.com as in any other of the 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:12.670
 stores that you frequent and then set 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:15.420
 the most important thing the most interesting is 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:17.979
 that you know that this has a utility 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:20.830
 starting from the leads that are for the 

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:22.030
 currents like the staple here not 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:26.110
 we have for example now still 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:28.030
 available in this in this framework but 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:29.710
 knowing that the staple is for some 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:31.000
 terms 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:32.740
 in which fishing is very very 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.900
 complicated the current is very strong 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:37.030
 then we would go directly to the 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:40.300
 pyramid we will continue with the balls 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:42.550
 then the golf leads are the ones behind 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:44.800
 of the ball the most stable leads then 

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:47.080
 we would look for days of little current and 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:48.640
 about everything we want to achieve 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:50.260
 longer hauls 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:53.680
 there is very little current that we already 

00:01:50.260 --> 00:02:00.240
 we would go to the fine leads from 100 130 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:02:00.240
 and 120 135 140 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:04.830
 and then days when there is a 

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:08.850
 slight current the leads are 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:11.160
 models you want us good too we 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:12.690
 we make it easy to get the subway a lot 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.370
 our haul but at the same time they have 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:16.710
 more stability than the promos 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:19.200
 fine leads this is quite important 

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:21.090
 that air control it because it 's clear 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.920
 that if we do not know that lead should 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:24.540
 use at all times also 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:26.490
 depending on the action of the cane is 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:28.620
 very likely that we will not be able to fix the 

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:30.240
 rigging in the sand if we look at the 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:32.670
 rigging in the sand and the rig is 

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:34.500
 completely quiet the function of the 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:37.530
 cookie is not the correct one and it's very 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:41.190
 likely that the couple in networks do not 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:43.080
 Let us fish and make it difficult for us 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:47.030
 make our catch then that 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:47.030
 it's the best and easiest to know 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:54.100
 we talk about fine lead streams for 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:57.550
 Long cast with low current and lead 

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:59.320
 want to do longs too but with 

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:01.090
 days a little more current and 

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:03.340
 we need to fix a little more 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:05.140
 progres this is the proposal that has 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:07.480
 the leader fishes right now on his page 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:10.540
 web these models you have available 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:12.940
 on your website and good is important 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:14.830
 that we learn to differentiate the utility 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:17.440
 from each of them we are going to make some 

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:19.510
 explanatory videos in for each of 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:21.100
 the leads and also comment a little 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:23.200
 good that the theme of colors still 

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:25.090
 it's a little live and you know that every 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:28.120
 fisherman has a different experience 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:29.890
 It is true that can accommodate you in 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:32.410
 certain moments with certain 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:34.270
 water colors or certain species 

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:35.770
 some colors or others but it is true 

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:38.590
 that with the leads, no matter also 

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:39.960
 they are fishing 12 well this is already a bit 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:42.090
 plus 

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:43.470
 to lesson of the fisherman the people who 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:45.090
 has a lot of faith in red people who 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:47.940
 prefer with water is to use the 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:49.740
 white people who bet to mimic 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:51.690
 the leads with dark colored colors 

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:53.190
 colors chains clear then good that 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:55.560
 it's a little more ambiguous but good 

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:57.510
 Here you have a fishing leader who is betting 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:58.920
 all these colors the dogs to you 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:01.400
 disposition any model in 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:04.590
 any color and well just that 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:06.510
 You know that this is what you have here 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:09.270
 we worry a little why why 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:13.290
 you have variety and that you have it 

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:15.600
 your disposition and nothing on the page 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:17.100

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:18.960
 order of any type of lead to a 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:21.230
 good price 

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:21.230
 once
