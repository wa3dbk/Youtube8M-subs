that I think and to tidy up that bit of

that I think and to tidy up that bit of
silver<00:02:55.300> blade<00:02:55.540> I'm<00:02:55.690> just<00:02:55.840> going<00:02:55.959> to<00:02:55.989> get<00:02:56.110> a

carefully<00:03:01.780> continue<00:03:02.530> on<00:03:02.709> around<00:03:03.010> this<00:03:03.370> little

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:03.550 
carefully continue on around this little

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:10.120 
enough detail to lift it up from what it

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:12.150 
enough detail to lift it up from what it
was<00:03:10.269> another<00:03:11.110> way<00:03:11.260> of<00:03:11.320> cleaning<00:03:11.530> up<00:03:11.739> is<00:03:11.890> using

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:12.160 
was another way of cleaning up is using

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:15.900 
was another way of cleaning up is using
a<00:03:12.220> cotton<00:03:12.430> bud<00:03:12.760> and<00:03:12.790> I<00:03:13.090> dip<00:03:13.299> it<00:03:13.420> in<00:03:13.980> wd-40<00:03:14.980> and

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:15.910 
a cotton bud and I dip it in wd-40 and

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:17.970 
a cotton bud and I dip it in wd-40 and
that<00:03:16.000> will<00:03:16.120> take<00:03:16.239> away<00:03:16.390> texture<00:03:16.900> while<00:03:17.799> it's

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:17.980 
that will take away texture while it's

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:21.990 
that will take away texture while it's
fresh<00:03:19.829> just<00:03:20.829> in<00:03:20.920> my<00:03:21.100> silver<00:03:21.430> sharpie<00:03:21.820> here

fresh just in my silver sharpie here
it's<00:03:22.120> seen<00:03:22.390> better<00:03:22.989> days<00:03:23.140> because<00:03:23.500> I've<00:03:23.620> used

00:03:23.789 --> 00:03:23.799 
it's seen better days because I've used

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:26.580 
it's seen better days because I've used
it<00:03:23.950> for<00:03:24.010> detailing<00:03:24.549> like<00:03:24.790> this<00:03:25.500> plenty<00:03:26.500> of

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:26.590 
it for detailing like this plenty of

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:30.180 
it for detailing like this plenty of
times<00:03:26.860> before<00:03:27.070> if<00:03:27.970> I'm<00:03:28.090> very<00:03:28.329> careful<00:03:28.870> I<00:03:29.190> can

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:30.190 
times before if I'm very careful I can

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:32.970 
times before if I'm very careful I can
still<00:03:30.430> pull<00:03:30.790> it<00:03:30.850> off<00:03:31.000> I<00:03:31.590> still<00:03:32.590> find<00:03:32.859> the

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:32.980 
still pull it off I still find the

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:35.520 
still pull it off I still find the
knife's<00:03:33.280> the<00:03:33.370> best<00:03:33.579> way<00:03:33.760> to<00:03:33.790> remove<00:03:34.530> the

knife's the best way to remove the

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:37.949 
knife's the best way to remove the
silver<00:03:35.980> I<00:03:36.250> think<00:03:36.940> the<00:03:37.000> one<00:03:37.120> thing<00:03:37.239> I<00:03:37.420> notice<00:03:37.750> is

00:03:37.949 --> 00:03:37.959 
silver I think the one thing I notice is

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:40.890 
silver I think the one thing I notice is
to<00:03:38.230> let<00:03:38.680> less<00:03:39.010> and<00:03:39.220> less<00:03:39.310> detail<00:03:39.820> going<00:03:40.540> on<00:03:40.720> to

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:40.900 
to let less and less detail going on to

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:44.340 
to let less and less detail going on to
toys<00:03:41.140> these<00:03:41.680> days<00:03:41.980> I<00:03:42.100> dare<00:03:42.400> say<00:03:43.140> it<00:03:44.140> be

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:44.350 
toys these days I dare say it be

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:47.460 
toys these days I dare say it be
associated<00:03:44.709> with<00:03:44.859> cost<00:03:45.820> or<00:03:46.630> we<00:03:47.109> could<00:03:47.290> spin

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:47.470 
associated with cost or we could spin

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:52.319 
associated with cost or we could spin
around<00:03:47.560> and<00:03:47.890> saying<00:03:48.540> profit<00:03:51.000> but<00:03:52.000> I<00:03:52.120> thought

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:52.329 
around and saying profit but I thought

00:03:52.329 --> 00:03:55.319 
around and saying profit but I thought
certainly<00:03:52.750> think<00:03:53.019> that<00:03:53.140> toys<00:03:54.060> good<00:03:55.060> toys

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:55.329 
certainly think that toys good toys

00:03:55.329 --> 00:03:58.440 
certainly think that toys good toys
expensive<00:03:55.989> toys<00:03:56.170> deserve<00:03:56.620> good<00:03:57.100> detail<00:03:57.489> and

00:03:58.440 --> 00:03:58.450 
expensive toys deserve good detail and

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:43.480 
of gold I've got a bit of cleanup to do

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:46.140 
of gold I've got a bit of cleanup to do
on<00:04:43.570> that<00:04:43.600> roof<00:04:43.900> line<00:04:44.140> and<00:04:44.170> again<00:04:44.830> I<00:04:44.860> just<00:04:45.150> pull

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:46.150 
on that roof line and again I just pull

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:50.780 
on that roof line and again I just pull
a<00:04:46.210> knife<00:04:46.390> through<00:04:47.790> it<00:04:48.790> for<00:04:49.000> the<00:04:49.120> excess<00:04:49.450> for<00:04:49.690> me

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:50.790 
a knife through it for the excess for me

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:53.640 
a knife through it for the excess for me
and<00:04:51.790> I'm<00:04:51.880> also<00:04:52.000> going<00:04:52.270> to<00:04:52.419> freshen<00:04:53.020> up<00:04:53.260> this

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:53.650 
and I'm also going to freshen up this

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:57.860 
and I'm also going to freshen up this
all<00:04:53.890> black<00:04:54.280> and<00:04:54.810> very<00:04:55.810> boring<00:04:56.110> little<00:04:57.100> caboose

00:04:57.860 --> 00:04:57.870 
all black and very boring little caboose

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:02.280 
all black and very boring little caboose
so<00:04:58.870> how<00:04:59.500> does<00:04:59.560> one<00:04:59.770> color<00:05:00.750> apply<00:05:01.750> to<00:05:01.810> this<00:05:02.050> can

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:02.290 
so how does one color apply to this can

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:06.900 
so how does one color apply to this can
completely<00:05:03.100> transform<00:05:03.760> it<00:05:05.460> just<00:05:06.460> to<00:05:06.550> explain

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:06.910 
completely transform it just to explain

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:08.700 
completely transform it just to explain

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:53.440 
would put a little bit more attention to

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:56.159 
would put a little bit more attention to
detail<00:05:53.530> into<00:05:54.250> the<00:05:55.120> toys<00:05:55.330> at<00:05:55.600> dishing<00:05:55.750> out<00:05:55.990> to
