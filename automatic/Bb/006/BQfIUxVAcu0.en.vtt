some minor tweaks there now I'm gonna
swap<00:02:50.340> layers<00:02:50.640> so<00:02:50.850> I'm<00:02:50.940> using<00:02:51.150> apostrophe<00:02:51.480> key

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
swap layers so I'm using apostrophe key

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:53.300 
swap layers so I'm using apostrophe key
so<00:02:52.320> now<00:02:52.350> that<00:02:52.500> the<00:02:52.710> splines<00:02:53.010> are<00:02:53.160> in<00:02:53.220> the

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
so now that the splines are in the

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:57.020 
so now that the splines are in the
background<00:02:53.520> and<00:02:54.650> I'm<00:02:55.650> going<00:02:56.010> to<00:02:56.280> go<00:02:56.970> to

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
background and I'm going to go to

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:05.290 
background and I'm going to go to
multiply<00:02:58.490> Riel<00:02:59.490> extrude<00:03:00.500> and<00:03:01.500> just<00:03:02.490> hit<00:03:02.610> okay

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:15.500 
I mean I worked always exactly but it's
really<00:03:14.190> easy<00:03:14.340> to<00:03:14.460> either<00:03:14.730> delete<00:03:14.970> those<00:03:15.180> out

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
really easy to either delete those out

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:20.090 
really easy to either delete those out
or<00:03:16.790> undo<00:03:17.790> and<00:03:18.150> do<00:03:19.050> a<00:03:19.080> real<00:03:19.290> extrude<00:03:19.650> again<00:03:19.890> I'm

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:20.100 
or undo and do a real extrude again I'm

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:22.250 
or undo and do a real extrude again I'm
going<00:03:20.220> to<00:03:20.280> try<00:03:20.460> it<00:03:20.580> without<00:03:20.960> turning<00:03:21.960> without

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.260 
going to try it without turning without

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:23.840 
going to try it without turning without
these<00:03:22.560> being<00:03:22.800> on<00:03:22.980> and<00:03:23.310> see<00:03:23.460> what<00:03:23.550> it<00:03:23.610> does

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:23.850 
these being on and see what it does

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:28.160 
these being on and see what it does
there<00:03:24.330> we<00:03:24.420> go<00:03:26.660> that's<00:03:27.660> what<00:03:27.720> it<00:03:27.870> does<00:03:27.990> it

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:28.170 
there we go that's what it does it

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:29.780 
there we go that's what it does it
creates<00:03:28.260> this<00:03:28.470> massive<00:03:28.530> hair<00:03:29.220> that<00:03:29.550> would<00:03:29.640> be

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:29.790 
creates this massive hair that would be

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:32.710 
creates this massive hair that would be
my<00:03:29.970> base<00:03:30.750> layer<00:03:31.050> of<00:03:31.170> hair<00:03:31.500> and<00:03:31.770> then

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:32.720 
my base layer of hair and then

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:35.990 
my base layer of hair and then
afterwards<00:03:33.720> I<00:03:34.020> would<00:03:34.080> go<00:03:34.410> and<00:03:34.820> do<00:03:35.820> that<00:03:35.940> a

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 
afterwards I would go and do that a

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.970 
afterwards I would go and do that a
similar<00:03:36.480> thing<00:03:36.810> like<00:03:36.870> this<00:03:37.350> and<00:03:37.620> so<00:03:37.710> we<00:03:37.830> do<00:03:37.950> it

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:37.980 
similar thing like this and so we do it

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:42.860 
similar thing like this and so we do it
in<00:03:38.130> sections<00:03:39.020> so<00:03:40.020> I<00:03:40.050> would<00:03:40.260> add<00:03:41.300> let's<00:03:42.300> say<00:03:42.450> for

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:42.870 
in sections so I would add let's say for

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:53.530 
in sections so I would add let's say for
example<00:03:43.290> let<00:03:43.530> me<00:03:47.690> say<00:03:48.690> select<00:03:48.960> these<00:03:49.230> here<00:03:51.290> and

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:53.540 
example let me say select these here and

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:57.320 
example let me say select these here and
doing<00:03:54.540> one<00:03:54.660> just<00:03:54.870> that<00:03:55.020> side<00:03:55.550> and<00:03:56.550> hit<00:03:57.210> the

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:57.330 
doing one just that side and hit the

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:01.250 
doing one just that side and hit the
equals<00:03:57.720> key<00:03:57.750> to<00:03:58.080> hide<00:03:58.290> the<00:03:58.440> unselected<00:03:59.990> and<00:04:00.990> so

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:01.260 
equals key to hide the unselected and so

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:02.960 
equals key to hide the unselected and so
I<00:04:01.500> would<00:04:01.710> do<00:04:01.950> another<00:04:02.130> layer<00:04:02.610> background

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:02.970 
I would do another layer background

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:08.150 
I would do another layer background
layer<00:04:03.240> that<00:04:03.480> and<00:04:03.660> swap<00:04:03.930> them<00:04:04.110> and<00:04:04.830> go<00:04:05.490> to<00:04:07.160> let's

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:08.160 
layer that and swap them and go to let's

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:13.250 
layer that and swap them and go to let's
see<00:04:08.460> creates

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:13.260 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:20.969 

okay<00:04:14.819> chief<00:04:15.819> remove<00:04:16.150> that<00:04:16.299> spline<00:04:19.680> y4o<00:04:20.680> tape

00:04:20.969 --> 00:04:20.979 
okay chief remove that spline y4o tape

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:24.900 
okay chief remove that spline y4o tape
chief<00:04:21.310> remove<00:04:22.710> and<00:04:23.710> let<00:04:23.919> me<00:04:23.979> do<00:04:24.160> a<00:04:24.190> copy-paste

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:24.910 
chief remove and let me do a copy-paste

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:29.820 
chief remove and let me do a copy-paste
and<00:04:27.060> I<00:04:28.060> have<00:04:28.540> to<00:04:28.720> paste<00:04:29.020> and<00:04:29.440> this<00:04:29.500> movie<00:04:29.800> out

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:29.830 
and I have to paste and this movie out

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:37.320 
and I have to paste and this movie out
there<00:04:30.100> now<00:04:30.910> I<00:04:30.970> can<00:04:31.449> kind<00:04:31.780> of<00:04:35.820> style<00:04:36.820> this<00:04:37.060> one<00:04:37.300> a

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:37.330 
there now I can kind of style this one a

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:45.090 
there now I can kind of style this one a
little<00:04:37.540> bit<00:04:42.300> just<00:04:43.300> like<00:04:43.449> so<00:04:43.690> just<00:04:44.410> very<00:04:44.740> simple

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:45.100 
little bit just like so just very simple

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:49.820 
little bit just like so just very simple
little<00:04:46.800> say<00:04:47.800> wave<00:04:48.040> in<00:04:48.250> the<00:04:48.340> hair<00:04:48.550> or<00:04:48.700> something

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:49.830 
little say wave in the hair or something

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:52.230 
little say wave in the hair or something
swap<00:04:50.830> layers<00:04:51.160> and<00:04:51.639> let's<00:04:51.850> do<00:04:51.940> the<00:04:52.030> same<00:04:52.180> thing

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:52.240 
swap layers and let's do the same thing

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:59.280 
swap layers and let's do the same thing
again<00:04:52.419> let's<00:04:52.780> do<00:04:52.930> a<00:04:53.070> multi<00:04:54.070> rail<00:04:54.220> extrude<00:04:58.290> and

00:04:59.280 --> 00:04:59.290 
again let's do a multi rail extrude and

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:02.550 
again let's do a multi rail extrude and
you<00:04:59.650> can<00:04:59.740> see<00:04:59.889> that<00:05:00.040> the<00:05:00.580> those<00:05:01.169> points<00:05:02.169> right

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:02.560 
you can see that the those points right

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:07.170 
you can see that the those points right
those<00:05:02.770> follies<00:05:03.780> try<00:05:04.780> and<00:05:04.930> follow<00:05:05.110> that<00:05:05.500> I<00:05:06.180> can

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:07.180 
those follies try and follow that I can

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:12.450 
those follies try and follow that I can
also<00:05:07.300> turn<00:05:09.240> or<00:05:10.240> in<00:05:10.630> scaling<00:05:11.199> back<00:05:11.350> on<00:05:11.590> and<00:05:11.949> that

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:12.460 
also turn or in scaling back on and that

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:14.340 
also turn or in scaling back on and that
kind<00:05:12.729> of<00:05:12.789> ease<00:05:13.060> it<00:05:13.180> a<00:05:13.240> try<00:05:13.510> let<00:05:13.750> me<00:05:13.780> try<00:05:13.840> turning

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:14.350 
kind of ease it a try let me try turning

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:17.580 
kind of ease it a try let me try turning
off<00:05:14.500> scaling<00:05:15.010> there<00:05:15.220> we<00:05:15.370> go<00:05:16.260> so<00:05:17.260> if<00:05:17.350> you<00:05:17.440> do

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:17.590 
off scaling there we go so if you do

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:19.529 
off scaling there we go so if you do
this<00:05:17.740> with<00:05:17.950> a<00:05:17.979> with<00:05:18.430> more<00:05:18.910> points<00:05:19.360> you<00:05:19.419> can

00:05:19.529 --> 00:05:19.539 
this with a with more points you can

00:05:19.539 --> 00:05:24.420 
this with a with more points you can
just<00:05:19.690> basically<00:05:19.860> build<00:05:20.860> up<00:05:22.950> the<00:05:23.950> style<00:05:24.250> you

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:24.430 
just basically build up the style you

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:27.560 
just basically build up the style you
want<00:05:24.460> on<00:05:24.760> top<00:05:24.789> of<00:05:25.090> the<00:05:25.150> base<00:05:25.330> here<00:05:25.500> from<00:05:26.500> there

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:27.570 
want on top of the base here from there

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:32.219 
want on top of the base here from there
but<00:05:28.570> you<00:05:28.810> can<00:05:28.930> see<00:05:29.110> that<00:05:29.260> it<00:05:29.410> took<00:05:31.020> just<00:05:32.020> a<00:05:32.200> few

00:05:32.219 --> 00:05:32.229 
but you can see that it took just a few

00:05:32.229 --> 00:05:39.450 
but you can see that it took just a few
seconds<00:05:33.900> to<00:05:34.900> produce<00:05:35.740> that<00:05:36.160> so<00:05:37.889> not<00:05:38.889> not<00:05:39.190> very

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:39.460 
seconds to produce that so not not very

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:42.180 
seconds to produce that so not not very
difficult<00:05:39.880> to<00:05:40.000> do
