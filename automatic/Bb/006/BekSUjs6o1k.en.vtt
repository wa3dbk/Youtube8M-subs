00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:14.450
 Hello, today's video lesson we 

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:17.029
 we will learn to knit twisted column 

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:18.830
 for this, I have a chain of 

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:23.720
 air loops and i will knit 

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:28.580
 crochet number 5 so we have a hook straight 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:33.920
 so I am now performing 5 naquids 1 2 

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:38.920
 3 4 and 5 enter the hook into the fourth 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:42.280
 air loop pull the thread 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:45.830
 now grabbing a working thread 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:50.120
 I knit 2 loops nearest and now 

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:52.580
 starting to rotate the hook from myself and this 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:56.269
 the hook must be pushed through here 

00:00:52.580 --> 00:01:00.710
 these are our nakida and so here i am scrolling 

00:00:56.269 --> 00:01:03.070
 you and our little loop seemed so 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:06.049
 we performed the first twisted column 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:08.630
 Now I am performing one air 

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:14.780
 loop to secure the first column 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:17.920
 now again doing 5 nakidov 1 2 3 4 and 5 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:22.180
 I insert the hook into the next air loop 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:24.890
 pull the thread grab the thread 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:27.710
 I knit two nearest loops and 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:31.579
 now starting to turn the hook off 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:34.719
 yourself putting a hook through all the bows on 

00:01:31.579 --> 00:01:37.939
 our hook which were here seemed 

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:40.189
 loop and we performed 2 turns 

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:47.990
 column now doing one air 

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:49.999
 loop do again 5 nakidov 1 2 3 4 and 5 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:52.070
 I enter the hook into the next air 

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:54.890
 pull the loop 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:57.470
 thread grabbing thread and tying two 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:02:01.250
 coming loops now starting to twist 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:04.070
 hook by itself stretches across the force 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:08.209
 these loops and so ours seemed 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:12.709
 thread completed 3 twisted column and now 

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:14.209
 perform one air loop and so 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:16.370
 Now I'll show you how even different 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:20.360
 can be made twisted column 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:26.090
 for this we need a needle we take 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:28.340
 thick needle and attach it to our 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:30.980
 hook lugs desirable to attach 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:41.709
 to this hook and now we 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:44.600
 we make 5 naquids 1 2 3 4 and 5 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:45.830
 Now I insert the hook into the next 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:47.930
 air loop 

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:52.940
 a small needle away so that it does not 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:56.030
 prevented pulling the thread working needle 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:59.180
 I return the original position that is 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:02.180
 moving the circle back and now the thread 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:06.650
 which I stretched through 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:08.870
 loops on our hooks and needles and so here 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:12.890
 I stretched it turned out two loops on 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:14.810
 hook needle I remove grab thread and 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:17.780
 I knit these two loops 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:19.299
 now take again and put a needle 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:28.400
 to our hook 

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:30.380
 I do 5 nakidov 1 2 3 4 and 5 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:33.260
 a small needle moving back to the right to 

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:36.970
 she did not interfere introduce the hook into the next 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:40.640
 air loop pull the needle 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:43.880
 I move to the left back now the thread that 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:46.519
 I pulled her through 

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:50.060
 the loops that we had on the hook and 

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:52.790
 on needles and so here stretched a needle 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:55.579
 I'm cleaning up two loops 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:57.980
 on the hook now I grab the thread and 

00:03:55.579 --> 00:04:01.160
 I knit 2 loops here 

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:03.669
 again twisted column now take again 

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:03.669
 needle 

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:14.419
 I do 5 nakidov I do 1 nakid 2 3 4 and 5 

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:16.880
 I insert the hook into the next air loop 

00:04:14.419 --> 00:04:20.000
 needle moving back to the right so as not to 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:24.280
 interfered and pulling the working thread now 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:27.350
 I move the needle to the left and back now 

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:30.470
 the thread that I pulled it stretch 

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:33.230
 through all the loops on the hook and on the needle 

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:35.840
 so here is pulled out two loops 

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:38.150
 on the hook needle clean now 

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:38.630
 grab the thread and knit these two 

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:41.060
 peaks 

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:43.130
 here we are twisted here 

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:46.430
 columns that is they can be taken either with 

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:50.030
 using a needle or just turning 

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:52.729
 the hook from myself is so necessary to knit 

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:56.479
 if you have a hook straight if you 

00:04:52.729 --> 00:04:59.479
 the hook has a tapered shape is not 

00:04:56.479 --> 00:05:01.610
 use of a needle is not for use 

00:04:59.479 --> 00:05:03.979
 you do not need to turn the hook 

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:06.710
 because the diameter of the hook on the right and on 

00:05:03.979 --> 00:05:08.210
 much more than the left and therefore you are without 

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:11.720
 problems stretch 

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:14.090
 thread through the loop that you scored on 

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:16.300
 hook so on this our video lesson 

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:18.680
 finished thanks everyone for attention
