00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:06.299
 Hmm 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:25.820
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:27.130
 To sing 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:44.650
 Yeah yeah yeah 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:47.890
 Pon's Noodle 

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:51.190
 So let's actually go by the first code to use first 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:54.610
 d code ad code is 4 strings open 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:59.850
 And 3 strings 2 frets 

00:00:54.610 --> 00:01:05.089
 2 fret of the first string in two hotels of Sanbe and middle finger in medicine Date 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:10.250
 Hold down like this and with your right hand you will predict your thumb 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:18.360
 Please set your index finger to 3 out of 3 and set the ring finger in one place. 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:20.120
 With this set up, first let the prophetic thumb and then the 3rd string, 1 st 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:23.510
 At first glance with 2 cases 

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:26.850
 Middle digit toxicity together 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:29.880
 It sounds and 2nd is 3 strings and 1 sting 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:32.659
 At the beginning of this 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.659
 Yen 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:42.080
 Let's put in the wind The right hand keeps the shape while keeping the code 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:45.560
 It will be a good diminish of d minutes from d code 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:51.500
 How to hold the Diminish is also 4 strings open 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:56.979
 And the 3 3 fret this middle finger and 1 in the equipment 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:56.979
 Scattering with 2 frets and ring finger of 2 strings 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:01.159
 Like this 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:06.310
 Also in this state 4 

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:06.310
 3 and 21 together 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:11.780
 It has 8 minutes of timing 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:11.780
 3 Boo 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:20.629
 I will repeat this alternately 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:20.629
 d from W 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:23.220
 Minutes 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:28.340
 3 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:28.340
 pa 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:32.280
 Got 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:47.670
 And how to play will change a little at the last d code 

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:48.670
 a First, let 's talk this fret to the middle finger reduced by 1 from the state of d code 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:50.240
 Please give me 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:56.150
 Right hand 

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:58.770
 We will start at the beginning timing like 4 strings 3 strings 2 strings 1 string 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:02.240
 Wow 

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:02.240
 And next place 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:09.410
 I will put it in the wind 

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:12.690
 First look 

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:16.930
 Ring open and next time 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:21.100
 Hammer this during 2 frets of a string 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:23.020
 Hammering is only one pitching with the left hand only 

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:26.400
 I will make a sound 

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:26.400
 This to 16 parts of tie 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:33.060
 4th 

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:35.700
 And three times again at the timing of the garden 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:38.819
 And 2 more with 4 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:40.520
 And also choose for 8 minutes 

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:44.240
 I'm interested 

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:48.070
 When this goes, it's a circle 

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:48.070
 ase 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:56.290
 I will go again 2 more 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:56.290
 cm 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:03.440
 Now that you 've got an intall putter, let's go through a member and row slowly 

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:05.620
 I think I want to do first 

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:05.620
 water 

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:09.190
 me 

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:18.410
 Pooh 

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:26.410
 I will try to raise the tempo Well 

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:33.700
 me 

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:36.510
 me 

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:36.510
 Good good 

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.470
 2 

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:51.870
 The point here is that it is an arpeggio 

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:56.030
 I think it would be nice to have the image of taking each one long 

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:56.030
 One by one is short 

00:04:56.689 --> 00:04:58.989
 Phew 

00:04:59.289 --> 00:05:08.789
 It is distance 2 reel tool such as pan-pan pompon 

00:05:04.689 --> 00:05:08.789
 Jump to one by one and long 

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:13.820
 me 

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:17.370
 me 

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:29.690
 Come on by capturing the sound long like this 

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:34.720
 You of the I think that to way of feeling that goes into song 

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:34.720
 It specifies please first try to practice Inter pattern
