perhaps taking down some of these work

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:31.469

should<00:04:33.729> be<00:04:34.120> taking<00:04:34.389> down<00:04:34.479> very<00:04:34.780> very<00:04:34.840> easily

00:04:35.189 --> 00:04:35.199 
should be taking down very very easily

00:04:35.199 --> 00:04:37.320 
should be taking down very very easily
and<00:04:35.560> now<00:04:35.979> we<00:04:36.039> have<00:04:36.130> a<00:04:36.250> nidus<00:04:36.580> worm<00:04:36.910> coming<00:04:37.210> in

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:37.330 
and now we have a nidus worm coming in

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:39.060 
and now we have a nidus worm coming in
that's<00:04:37.599> going<00:04:37.780> to<00:04:37.870> be<00:04:37.960> very<00:04:38.229> very<00:04:38.590> effective

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:39.070 
that's going to be very very effective

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:40.740 
that's going to be very very effective
and<00:04:39.280> now<00:04:39.580> taking<00:04:39.849> down<00:04:40.060> this<00:04:40.210> gateway<00:04:40.479> and

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:40.750 
and now taking down this gateway and

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:42.330 
and now taking down this gateway and
this<00:04:40.900> pylon<00:04:41.229> so<00:04:41.410> pylon<00:04:41.770> getting<00:04:42.009> taking<00:04:42.220> down

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:42.340 
this pylon so pylon getting taking down

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:44.070 
this pylon so pylon getting taking down
