00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:11.130
 hello hello everybody's not gone by 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:13.920
 again I didn't care again 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.619
 no I'm here I put so much for you 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.749
 publish this or this video 

00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:20.519
 because I was working on two necklaces one 

00:00:18.749 --> 00:00:22.529
 given the other I was finishing 

00:00:20.519 --> 00:00:25.289
 but since they are two pollar I would be 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:26.880
 enjoyed making a video where showing 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:28.739
 together he showed v2 collars 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.929
 together, however, for the second 

00:00:28.739 --> 00:00:32.489
 but realization that it will take a while 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:34.920
 of time among other things I don't even know if 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:37.800
 the material I don't even know is enough for me 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:41.219
 if I really see the light if it comes 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.629
 But hopefully complete view of the fact 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:44.190
 long times of the second necklace 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:46.800
 meanwhile of a monster now first has 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.899
 made a collar that then ours 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:53.059
 and most of all water obviously 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:55.140
 I don't see anything or it 

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:57.179
 nice of this collar and that I have 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.219
 used only for a lot of lines 

00:00:57.179 --> 00:01:01.769
 very cheap, that is, there are some 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:05.269
 Measurement rocaille beads and classic mouse 

00:01:01.769 --> 00:01:07.250
 11 0 and then used 

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:10.399
 not all, however, almost all sedans 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:13.789
 cheap outlets you know the stalls or 

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:17.539
 those little shops that sell beads 

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:20.569
 sachets of affordable prices e 

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:21.049
 I don't know tot for there not only 50 for a 

00:01:20.569 --> 00:01:23.509
 EUR 

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:26.420
 so they are all for non-regular lines 

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:28.159
 often and the hole is bad there are for 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:32.020
 example of the gods most worthy are 

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:32.020
 originals barred ski absolutely 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:36.259
 but the final effect on the collar 

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:38.649
 according to me very very nice because 

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:40.670
 all these inaccuracies are not seen 

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:42.350
 considering that the processing anyway 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:44.000
 composed of all elements rather 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:45.740
 large in quotation marks 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:50.450
 in short, we are always in my action 4 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:52.009
 mm around we say the only product that 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:56.119
 used by a little more quality 

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:59.869
 they would be on pole in English 

00:01:56.119 --> 00:02:02.000
 help me half the crystals means 

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:04.369
 red crystals 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.590
 nothing now shows with the neighbor 

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:07.819
 so we avoid art time 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:09.679
 this is the collar we say seen 

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:11.569
 from above 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:14.660
 then this is the matrix of the necklace 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:17.660
 as you can easily see the first row 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:21.230
 of the work is composed of a matrix i 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:23.090
 square, that is, follow me for a moment 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:25.400
 is the first continuous square with the 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:27.860
 second and then I repeat the first again 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:30.560
 is the second again as you see then 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:33.709
 are two squares that alternate as 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:35.989
 starting with a golden bead here for 

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:40.340
 the black cai 11 0 then I inserted a 

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:42.680
 donut a faceted donut 2 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:45.170
 rocaille beads size 11 0 this 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:48.530
 green oval sedan 2 rock beads 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:51.620
 indices 0 this half crystal measure 4 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:53.709
 mm 2 for Niero dear 11 0 again 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:56.780
 bead is worth and then another sedan 

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:59.540
 rocaille 11 0 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:01.549
 I went with the lake through the 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:04.870
 rockery bead 11 0 located here 

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:07.670
 near the neck the woman 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:09.380
 the other rockery counter measures 11 0 then 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:12.970
 a rocaille bead inserted into the work 

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:16.639
 15 0 red which recalled the red of the 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:18.889
 half crystal and I started the 

00:03:16.639 --> 00:03:23.269
 sequence then again for line 11 0 

00:03:18.889 --> 00:03:25.940
 donut 2 beads 11 0 perrino is worth one 

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:28.160
 bead 11 0 here I entered the cone bb 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:31.700
 not bar ski here filippi with 

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:35.060
 cheap an icon a bead size 11 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:38.299
 0 another b cone berlin 11 0 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:40.430
 for linen it is worth 11 gilded then 

00:03:38.299 --> 00:03:41.780
 instead of going through the pen 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:44.930
 red I went directly 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:46.609
 through the golden pawn donut 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:48.769
 for nature tae I started the 

00:03:46.609 --> 00:03:51.409
 sequence with the m crystal then like 

00:03:48.769 --> 00:03:54.560
 you see very simple and so I finished 

00:03:51.409 --> 00:03:58.939
 the first line in the processing for the 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:04:02.510
 second I left from this say ho 

00:03:58.939 --> 00:04:04.069
 on the lake there seem to be 5 beads 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:05.719
 rocaille 11 0 

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:07.909
 another b cone that i went into 

00:04:05.719 --> 00:04:09.560
 in the bead 11 0 that was already present 

00:04:07.909 --> 00:04:11.450
 at work then I started mine 

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:14.930
 sequence that I repeated until the end 

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:19.609
 icon bead 11 0 perino applies to the 

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:22.250
 11 0 beautiful oval for the 11 0 b cone 

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:24.139
 I returned in the first 11 0 that was 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:25.729
 already present at work and I repeated 

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:29.930
 this sequence to complete the 

00:04:25.729 --> 00:04:32.090
 so simple simple lap for the 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:34.970
 closing he used I did 

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:38.150
 first of all sorry I did it first 

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:39.620
 these two alone with the beads with 

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:43.389
 of the years in line or hooked mine 

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:43.389
 closure which is a screw closure 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:51.830
 here it is and this is the series then 

00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:53.389
 as you see very simple materials 

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:56.270
 cheap can also be found easily 

00:04:53.389 --> 00:04:58.520
 because they are very common on the line 

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:59.750
 the effect in my opinion is very nice not 

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:03.080
 they seem 

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:06.530
 let's say it's a child if you scream 

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:12.100
 a little girl continues to scream in for 

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:12.100
 technique I told you the necklace and 

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:19.850
 perplexity 

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:22.400
 the column is simple the defects of the gods 

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:24.860
 components are there but not seen 

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:26.150
 because I assure you that if you look carefully 

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:28.460
 close to the term we see that not 

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:30.080
 they are regular sayings we see that 

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:32.900
 these oval beads are not 

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:35.840
 however, the effect is properly regular 

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:37.400
 final is very very very harmonious 

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:39.169
 nice I wanted to show you too 

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:41.419
 the other collar I was in 

00:05:39.169 --> 00:05:43.340
 even though I will explain it later in 

00:05:41.419 --> 00:05:46.040
 next video hoping I can 

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:48.530
 to complete this we say the first row 

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:51.650
 I've always used these washers these 

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:53.180
 they say they are not barred and then oh well 

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:55.850
 I have to add another component here 

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:57.890
 in the lower part I already know how it will be 

00:05:55.850 --> 00:06:00.169
 in short, how it will be composed in the meantime 

00:05:57.890 --> 00:06:02.810
 I finish the first row hoping to 

00:06:00.169 --> 00:06:05.419
 be able to complete for that collar 

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:09.350
 because I don't have many of these 

00:06:05.419 --> 00:06:11.240
 donuts unfortunately I realized that 

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:14.000
 maybe they won't be enough to finish the 

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:15.620
 necklace and I can't buy those 

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.930
 regular because they are a little different 

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:20.870
 they are slightly smaller than most items 

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:22.460
 large so they would probably do the 

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:25.450
 also the difference in tone 

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:29.240
 color is not exactly the same 

00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:30.650
 let's cross our fingers well as usual 

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:33.320
 I hope the design necklace of 

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:34.790
 inspiration and I hope to finish with 

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:38.350
 the other with the area as soon as possible 

00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:38.350
 see you at the next video
