the AI reservoir we're good you know

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:29.220 
the AI reservoir we're good you know
that's<00:02:20.500> it<00:02:20.740> done

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.230 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:51.230 

you

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:53.690 

all<00:02:51.780> right<00:02:51.990> the<00:02:52.110> solvus<00:02:52.530> feed<00:02:52.740> leader<00:02:53.040> got

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
all right the solvus feed leader got

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.790 
all right the solvus feed leader got
installed<00:02:54.060> here<00:02:54.540> just<00:02:55.140> make<00:02:55.320> sure<00:02:55.560> it<00:02:55.680> was

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:55.800 
installed here just make sure it was

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:57.740 
installed here just make sure it was
tight<00:02:56.040> in<00:02:56.250> its<00:02:56.400> place<00:02:56.670> you<00:02:57.030> don't<00:02:57.570> put<00:02:57.720> too

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
tight in its place you don't put too

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:59.480 
tight in its place you don't put too
much<00:02:57.870> torque<00:02:58.200> on<00:02:58.380> this<00:02:58.500> top<00:02:58.740> piece<00:02:59.010> here<00:02:59.040> but

00:02:59.480 --> 00:02:59.490 
much torque on this top piece here but

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:01.190 
much torque on this top piece here but
you<00:02:59.670> loosen<00:02:59.970> it<00:03:00.030> about<00:03:00.240> a<00:03:00.270> half<00:03:00.450> turn<00:03:00.840> and

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
you loosen it about a half turn and

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:04.490 
you loosen it about a half turn and
it'll<00:03:02.160> allow<00:03:02.430> the<00:03:03.180> ball<00:03:03.390> valve<00:03:03.690> in<00:03:03.990> there<00:03:04.170> to

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
it'll allow the ball valve in there to

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:07.370 
it'll allow the ball valve in there to
function<00:03:04.920> properly<00:03:05.340> so<00:03:05.840> once<00:03:06.840> it<00:03:07.050> hits<00:03:07.260> the

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:07.380 
function properly so once it hits the

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:09.740 
function properly so once it hits the
point<00:03:07.830> where<00:03:08.010> it<00:03:08.100> will<00:03:08.190> work<00:03:08.400> you'll<00:03:08.670> see<00:03:08.940> now

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
point where it will work you'll see now

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:11.270 
point where it will work you'll see now
you're<00:03:09.990> going<00:03:10.110> to<00:03:10.200> see<00:03:10.290> this<00:03:10.410> hose<00:03:10.650> fill<00:03:11.100> up

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
you're going to see this hose fill up

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:15.290 
you're going to see this hose fill up
with<00:03:11.520> fluid<00:03:12.030> an<00:03:12.330> inch<00:03:12.960> up<00:03:13.230> every<00:03:13.650> time<00:03:13.920> as<00:03:14.300> I

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:15.300 
with fluid an inch up every time as I

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:18.110 
with fluid an inch up every time as I
press<00:03:15.630> it<00:03:15.840> but<00:03:16.050> not<00:03:16.230> suck<00:03:16.620> back<00:03:16.860> in<00:03:17.130> that's<00:03:17.880> the

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.120 
press it but not suck back in that's the

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:21.740 
press it but not suck back in that's the
valve<00:03:18.330> working<00:03:18.840> one<00:03:19.020> way<00:03:19.230> correctly<00:03:20.570> this<00:03:21.570> is

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
valve working one way correctly this is

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:23.930 
valve working one way correctly this is
how<00:03:21.900> you<00:03:21.960> solve<00:03:22.320> a<00:03:22.530> system<00:03:22.740> functions<00:03:23.610> to

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:23.940 
how you solve a system functions to

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:26.330 
how you solve a system functions to
bleed<00:03:24.180> your<00:03:24.330> brakes<00:03:24.390> as<00:03:24.870> a<00:03:24.900> speed<00:03:25.200> leader<00:03:25.500> you

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 
bleed your brakes as a speed leader you

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:29.750 
bleed your brakes as a speed leader you
can<00:03:26.490> see<00:03:26.760> it<00:03:26.880> there<00:03:27.120> it<00:03:27.210> goes<00:03:28.550> and<00:03:29.550> we'll

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:29.760 
can see it there it goes and we'll

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:38.360 
can see it there it goes and we'll
tighten<00:03:29.970> it<00:03:30.150> up

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:38.370 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:40.380 

we're<00:03:39.370> going<00:03:39.489> to<00:03:39.550> believe<00:03:39.670> the<00:03:39.909> farthest

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:40.390 
we're going to believe the farthest

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:47.220 
we're going to believe the farthest
caliper<00:03:41.319> now<00:03:42.299> and<00:03:43.299> get<00:03:43.450> this<00:03:43.709> ranch<00:03:44.709> on<00:03:44.950> the

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:47.230 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:49.290 

drain<00:03:47.920> valve<00:03:48.220> portion<00:03:48.819> of<00:03:48.910> this<00:03:49.030> here

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:49.300 
drain valve portion of this here

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:51.510 
drain valve portion of this here
basically<00:03:50.260> you've<00:03:50.650> got<00:03:50.800> to<00:03:50.920> turn<00:03:51.100> this<00:03:51.280> thing

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:51.520 
basically you've got to turn this thing

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:56.610 
basically you've got to turn this thing
a<00:03:51.640> half<00:03:51.850> turn<00:03:52.680> to<00:03:53.680> allow<00:03:53.950> it<00:03:54.130> to<00:03:54.250> bleed<00:03:55.410> so<00:03:56.410> imma

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:56.620 
a half turn to allow it to bleed so imma

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:59.790 
a half turn to allow it to bleed so imma
turn<00:03:56.800> this<00:03:56.890> one<00:03:57.130> half<00:03:57.370> turn<00:03:57.580> like<00:03:58.510> that<00:03:58.800> side

00:03:59.790 --> 00:03:59.800 
turn this one half turn like that side

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:12.560 
turn this one half turn like that side
marker<00:04:00.160> start<00:04:00.400> pumping

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:12.570
