00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:13.370 
first plug which I just lift out of the

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:18.300 
first plug which I just lift out of the
tray<00:01:13.729> pop<00:01:14.510> into<00:01:14.930> the<00:01:15.080> hole<00:01:15.530> and<00:01:15.890> gently<00:01:17.229> fill

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:22.690 
tray pop into the hole and gently fill
it<00:01:19.310> down<00:01:19.700> around<00:01:21.130> then<00:01:22.130> I'm<00:01:22.250> on<00:01:22.370> to<00:01:22.520> my<00:01:22.640> next

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:22.700 
it down around then I'm on to my next

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:26.740 
it down around then I'm on to my next
one<00:01:23.120> now<00:01:23.409> sometimes<00:01:24.490> it<00:01:25.490> can<00:01:26.060> be<00:01:26.270> a<00:01:26.299> little<00:01:26.510> bit

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:26.750 
one now sometimes it can be a little bit

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:29.289 
one now sometimes it can be a little bit
tricky<00:01:27.229> getting<00:01:27.470> plug<00:01:28.159> plants<00:01:28.670> out<00:01:28.909> of<00:01:29.090> these

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:29.299 
tricky getting plug plants out of these

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:33.340 
tricky getting plug plants out of these
trays<00:01:29.720> and<00:01:30.200> if<00:01:30.860> so<00:01:31.220> the<00:01:32.180> best<00:01:32.450> thing<00:01:32.690> to<00:01:32.720> do<00:01:33.049> is

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:33.350 
trays and if so the best thing to do is

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:36.910 
trays and if so the best thing to do is
to<00:01:33.619> get<00:01:33.799> a<00:01:33.830> pencil<00:01:34.190> and<00:01:34.820> just<00:01:35.080> gently<00:01:36.080> push<00:01:36.680> it

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:36.920 
to get a pencil and just gently push it

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.789 
to get a pencil and just gently push it
from<00:01:37.159> below<00:01:37.549> and<00:01:37.970> you<00:01:38.390> can<00:01:38.570> see<00:01:38.900> it<00:01:39.260> just<00:01:39.290> will

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:39.799 
from below and you can see it just will

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:44.080 
from below and you can see it just will
pop<00:01:40.040> up<00:01:40.070> very<00:01:40.549> easily<00:01:40.820> then<00:01:41.619> so<00:01:42.619> again<00:01:43.580> just

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:44.090 
pop up very easily then so again just

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:47.350 
pop up very easily then so again just
fill<00:01:44.330> the<00:01:44.479> compost<00:01:45.580> poke<00:01:46.580> a<00:01:46.610> little<00:01:46.760> hole<00:01:47.000> in

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:47.360 
fill the compost poke a little hole in

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:51.670 
fill the compost poke a little hole in
it<00:01:47.510> gently<00:01:48.470> lift<00:01:48.740> the<00:01:48.799> plug<00:01:49.100> out

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:51.680 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:58.320 

and<00:01:52.270> firm<00:01:53.270> it<00:01:53.450> down

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:58.330 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:01.470 

so<00:01:59.080> that's<00:01:59.620> it<00:01:59.890> here's<00:02:00.310> my<00:02:00.520> petunias<00:02:01.180> all
