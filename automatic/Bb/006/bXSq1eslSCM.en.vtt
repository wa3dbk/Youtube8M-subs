00:00:06.379 --> 00:00:11.559
 live today 

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:11.559
 I hold off 

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:13.980
 today 

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:17.110
 would reduce a 

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:24.860
 At first we broke the old ones 

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:24.860
 milled 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:33.840
 so that we can fly better is that 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:40.040
 now everything is dead here you see 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:45.239
 again pepper with flight once the ground 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:48.390
 check and then we will with 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:52.020
 a color combination that is behind the 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:55.850
 tug stands again the seedbed 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:01:00.180
 prepare and then a new passat 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:02.690
 which we will see you soon 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.690
 show 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:07.710
 you can not see treks early 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:11.460
 we'll look exactly where he is 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:14.630
 Coming back we mixed the ground upside down 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.630
 and aerate 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:19.580
 17 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:25.479
 once it works through me and also 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:40.400
 we have it now with an ointment 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:43.460
 combination once everything pulled through 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:46.790
 thus better dries now is it 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:49.130
 still completely the surface planiert 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:52.010
 Beautiful with this dozer blade 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:54.950
 After that we will do it again 

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:57.820
 edit with the combination and then 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:02:02.140
 finally we see the grass one 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:04.730
 and now slowly the weather has none 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:06.860
 said is no longer good with us and 

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:09.280
 now we have to slowly release the gas 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:09.280
 we finished 

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:30.409
 so it has equipment now we have to 

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:31.340
 hurry that you scrape, however 

00:02:30.409 --> 00:02:34.359
 get ready 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:37.459
 it will be a long night 

00:02:34.359 --> 00:02:39.620
 but it is just so I have 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:40.340
 That's why we talked too much 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:42.680
 very pleased 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:44.599
 I wish you all the best and to 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:46.750
 next time we would be us 

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:50.450
 into it you can cook the grass here 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:54.370
 arrived from ahlbeck I was 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:54.370
