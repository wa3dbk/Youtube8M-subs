00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:53.589 
in here because you don't want to put
velcro<00:01:50.789> on<00:01:51.119> this<00:01:51.360> part<00:01:51.690> either<00:01:52.140> and<00:01:53.009> then<00:01:53.310> I

00:01:53.589 --> 00:01:53.599 
velcro on this part either and then I

00:01:53.599 --> 00:01:59.089 
velcro on this part either and then I
pretty<00:01:54.599> much<00:01:54.950> secure<00:01:55.950> it<00:01:56.149> like<00:01:57.149> so<00:01:57.539> so<00:01:58.099> if

00:01:59.089 --> 00:01:59.099 
pretty much secure it like so so if

00:01:59.099 --> 00:02:04.820 
pretty much secure it like so so if
you'll<00:01:59.310> notice<00:01:59.700> um<00:02:00.060> all<00:02:00.599> my<00:02:00.869> curls<00:02:01.259> are<00:02:01.470> up<00:02:03.830> and

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:04.830 
you'll notice um all my curls are up and

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:07.070 
you'll notice um all my curls are up and
then<00:02:05.009> I'll<00:02:05.160> pull<00:02:05.369> it<00:02:05.399> up<00:02:05.729> so<00:02:06.539> it's<00:02:06.690> out<00:02:06.840> of<00:02:06.959> my

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:07.080 
then I'll pull it up so it's out of my

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:07.960 
then I'll pull it up so it's out of my
face

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:07.970 
face

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:11.540 
face
it<00:02:08.970> helps<00:02:09.360> push<00:02:09.539> more<00:02:09.720> curls<00:02:10.050> up<00:02:10.289> I'm<00:02:11.280> going<00:02:11.489> to

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
it helps push more curls up I'm going to

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:18.260 
it helps push more curls up I'm going to
make<00:02:11.670> sure<00:02:11.700> to<00:02:12.410> adjust<00:02:13.410> the<00:02:13.770> back<00:02:13.980> as<00:02:14.190> well<00:02:17.270> and

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:18.270 
make sure to adjust the back as well and

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:19.860 
make sure to adjust the back as well and
that's<00:02:18.480> the<00:02:18.660> first<00:02:18.900> step<00:02:19.080> that<00:02:19.379> I<00:02:19.500> do

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 
that's the first step that I do

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:22.050 
that's the first step that I do
so<00:02:20.110> I<00:02:20.470> mean<00:02:20.860> this<00:02:21.010> one's<00:02:21.280> pretty<00:02:21.430> also<00:02:21.940> it's

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:24.089 
so I mean this one's pretty also it's
not<00:02:22.209> as<00:02:22.450> secure<00:02:22.930> but<00:02:23.470> it's<00:02:23.590> not<00:02:23.739> going<00:02:23.890> to<00:02:23.950> come

00:02:24.089 --> 00:02:24.099 
not as secure but it's not going to come

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:31.000 
there's no curls down here because I

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.510 
there's no curls down here because I
pulled<00:04:31.300> everything<00:04:31.660> up<00:04:32.050> and<00:04:32.740> it<00:04:33.190> kind<00:04:33.430> of

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:33.520 
pulled everything up and it kind of

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:35.610 
pulled everything up and it kind of
looks<00:04:33.730> like<00:04:33.850> about<00:04:34.210> an<00:04:34.330> apple<00:04:34.480> but<00:04:34.750> again<00:04:35.410> it's

not<00:04:35.680> a<00:04:35.860> pineapple<00:04:36.160> I<00:04:36.520> guess<00:04:36.670> it's<00:04:36.850> a<00:04:36.970> generic

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:37.300

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:05.610 
can definitely feel like it's a little
more<00:05:01.450> snug<00:05:01.780> doesn't<00:05:02.740> have<00:05:02.890> this<00:05:03.040> much<00:05:03.310> room<00:05:04.620> as

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:05.620 
more snug doesn't have this much room as

more snug doesn't have this much room as
the<00:05:05.860> other<00:05:06.040> one<00:05:06.250> but<00:05:06.280> this<00:05:06.550> one<00:05:06.730> is<00:05:06.850> equally

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:07.240 
the other one but this one is equally

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:09.210
