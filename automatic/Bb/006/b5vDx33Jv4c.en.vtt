 channel and welcome to a new video on 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.820
 this case is about a new top 5 

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:16.680
 video games that has to do 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.029
 precisely with the e3 that is at 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.529
 around the corner as many 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:20.789
 you will know in fact this same afternoon 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:22.679
 I suppose you have already uploaded a 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:23.970
 small video in which he advanced them 

00:00:22.679 --> 00:00:25.829
 what would be the different 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.630
 conference schedules and also 

00:00:25.829 --> 00:00:28.980
 Of course I confirmed that I will go 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.079
 covering as they go 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.640
 taking place in the channel of fact os 

00:00:31.079 --> 00:00:34.710
 I'll leave that video in the description by 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.359
 if you want to take a look at part of 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.760
 that focusing us now so yes in 

00:00:36.359 --> 00:00:40.230
 the top 5 as such in this case before 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.090
 get fully into the e3 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.370
 I wanted to make a small video something 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.870
 more staff than usual and comment 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.480
 what are the 5 video games that more 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.949
 I hope for this next e3 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.449
 It should be noted that I have stayed 

00:00:49.949 --> 00:00:53.250
 only with video games that has been 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:55.260
 confirmed that appear so 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.960
 official in the e3 ie say for example 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:00.329
 I really want to see cyberpunk 2077 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.980
 but I know it will not appear in that 3 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.260
 because no one has said anything about it to 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.090
 not to be surprised so I've 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.259
 stayed with those 5 video games that you go 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.970
 to see below I hope you like it 

00:01:07.259 --> 00:01:10.560
 it's a totally personal opinion 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.090
 so do not hesitate to leave me in the 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.470
 comments yours so 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.790
 let's start in the fifth position in this 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.010
 case with a video game that possibly 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:19.170
 many of you do not even 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:21.450
 you will have paid the least attention but 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.430
 Do not be surprised if I tell you in this 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.740
 case that I have many very much desire 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.450
 to see more information about ex with two 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.010
 and is that this strategy title was 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.900
 announced relatively recently of the 

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:33.270
 hand of 2k games after having us 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:35.670
 showed that little teaser with the 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.890
 code name of advent that after 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.110
 discovered that he was indeed ex with 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.250
 two because in this case I have many 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.600
 want to see what it is that we are going to 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.800
 show a little more example and a 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.540
 little more history and especially 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:48.240
 the news that will include face 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:50.369
 to the second installment of ex com 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.470
 taking into account that the previous one between 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:54.990
 quotes canonically speaking was the 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.369
 of ex com enemy unknown the truth is that 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.560
 It was a title that I once enjoyed 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:00.420
 very much to lecce too many hours already 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.340
 Today I still enjoy the time in 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.170
 when for that reason I know it's not one of 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.400
 the titles that you win most will have 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.530
 many of you to see but 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:09.209
 I personally want to know a little bit 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.679
 more on this title we continue now 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:12.390
 with the fourth position in this case with 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:14.190
 star wars battlefront maybe os 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:15.720
 It will surprise you to put in this position 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:18.630
 relatively low 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:20.070
 the table or the top 5 to this video game 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:22.170
 I should have been taller 

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:23.250
 sincerely but the reason why 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:25.170
 has been a little behind has been 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:28.020
 especially because of the last 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:30.030
 details and leaks that are gone 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:31.650
 discovering during the last months 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:33.630
 about the video game the fact that no 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:35.370
 have a campaign as such but 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:36.480
 simply cooperative missions in the 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:38.400
 that you will discover a little bit of 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:40.680
 history that there are no specific classes 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:43.290
 as there were the originals that there 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:45.750
 fewer planets and fewer maps than in the 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:47.550
 original also in battlefront 2 from 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:49.350
 then I still want very much 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:51.360
 try them is undeniable and for that reason 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:53.550
 I want to put him in a position of this top 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:55.230
 5 , but I are taking a little 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:57.810
 you win or at least I'm scared what 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:03:00.090
 that we are going to see in a definitive way 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:02.130
 but well I still have hope and 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:03.540
 I wish I was wrong and really the 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:05.370
 video game is up to the 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:06.840
 expectations if we now come to the 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:08.760
 third position and in this case I 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:11.010
 I would like to continue with another saga 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:13.050
 that I have special love of course and 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:14.940
 it's about sexier is that as I already 

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:17.250
 many will know bayo wear has announced 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:19.980
 recently web in recent months 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:22.050
 that in this 3 was going to show more 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:24.870
 details and hopefully please 

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:27.840
 gameplay of the video game the mass efect 4 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:29.280
 this new trilogy or at least what 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:31.020
 it seems that the developers are going to 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:33.510
 try to make a new trilogy that 

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:34.950
 supposes that it is not going to be a sequel neither 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:38.040
 a prequel so possibly 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:39.960
 maybe it's set at the same time 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:41.820
 that the first trilogy at the moment 

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:44.220
 there are many official details many 

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:46.050
 speculations many rumors but nothing 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:48.450
 tangible as such so I have some 

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:49.950
 terrible hope that this 3 arrives already 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:51.300
 to discover what it is that we are 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:52.800
 preparing let's move on to the second 

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:55.320
 position that in this case I have doubted 

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:57.570
 pretty if you put both efe 4 here or 

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:59.940
 put this video game that it comes in 

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:01.470
 this case of mirror's edge catalyst and it's 

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:03.330
 that has recently been has already 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:05.550
 officially announced that this 

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:07.710
 video game is not going to be a sequel like 

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:11.700
 such but simply a kind of 

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:14.520
 reboot or redo the video game again 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:15.930
 I did not know exactly how to define it but 

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:17.700
 so you can understand what they mean 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:20.130
 the developers is with technology 

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:22.920
 with which currently have redo 

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:24.810
 the original video game maybe some of 

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:26.820
 you this has a little bit to you 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:28.650
 back and you've lost some hype but 

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:29.160
 personally it 's something that to me 

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:31.500
 called 

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:33.390
 the truth reliving the adventure that 

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:36.030
 we had in mirror's edge the original 

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:37.620
 as such but in this case with a better 

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:39.930
 adaptation in terms of playability 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:42.180
 better graphics let's hope it's a 

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:43.650
 quantum leap in terms of what 

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:45.180
 they will offer respect to the original 

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:47.460
 because if it does not really not deserve the 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:49.110
 sorry for that I have some expectation 

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:50.670
 and at the same time a little scary the truth 

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:52.050
 I hope they do not disappoint and finally 

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:53.640
 to finish in the first position in 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:55.080
 this case I would like to put a 

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:56.580
 video game that I guess a lot of 

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:59.010
 you also position 'aces' in 

00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:00.840
 this place and it's about fall out 4 and it's 

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:03.240
 that even though I'm not perhaps the 

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:06.060
 best fan of the saga I have not played just 

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:07.380
 to fall out 1 and fall out 2 yes that is 

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:09.600
 true that is for the new vegas and for 

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:12.900
 I've spent too many hours on all 3 of them 

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:14.250
 more than 300 between them and still for the 

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:16.440
 Univer has not happened to me yet so 

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:18.810
 complete is the pending task that I have 

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:20.400
 before they announce more information 

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:22.350
 about fall of 4 or at least before 

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:23.910
 come out fall out 4 and that is the rumors 

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:26.160
 point to that this could even come out 

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:27.870
 year at the moment there is not much apart from the 

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:30.480
 trailer that we saw a little bit ago that 

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:32.130
 fact has a motor in game and I what 

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:33.600
 I really look forward to this 13 is 

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:34.860
 give us more information about everything 

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:35.580
 around history since the 

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:37.289
 rumors 

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:39.840
 we could even control two 

00:05:37.289 --> 00:05:41.759
 characters one after the apocalypse and 

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:44.280
 another before now there is nothing 100 

00:05:41.759 --> 00:05:45.930
 confirmed so patience and let's leave 

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:47.520
 that bethesda surprise us the week that 

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:49.050
 comes and in order until this top 5 

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:50.580
 video game I hope it's liked as 

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:52.650
 you have already seen has been something more 

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:54.240
 staff than usual but really 

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:56.250
 this section is always true 

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:57.479
 subjective point so I hope that 

00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:59.099
 likewise you liked it if it has been 

00:05:57.479 --> 00:06:00.870
 so they would not have liked me in 

00:05:59.099 --> 00:06:02.430
 share the video on social networks 

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:04.289
 and also of course tell me in the 

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:06.060
 comments what are the 5 videogames 

00:06:04.289 --> 00:06:07.830
 that you are most eager to see in 

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:08.940
 this e3 in order nothing else because part of 

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:11.930
 thank you very much for having seen it be 

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:11.930
 happy and see you
