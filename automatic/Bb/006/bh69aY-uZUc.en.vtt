is just gonna take this one you just pop
it<00:00:40.320> right<00:00:40.500> out<00:00:40.649> like<00:00:41.010> this

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:41.960 
it right out like this

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:49.910 
it right out like this
safety<00:00:42.960> first<00:00:46.430> crazy<00:00:47.430> and<00:00:47.850> then<00:00:48.750> all<00:00:49.530> I<00:00:49.559> do<00:00:49.770> is

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
safety first crazy and then all I do is

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.920 
safety first crazy and then all I do is
I<00:00:50.070> open<00:00:50.730> up<00:00:50.789> the<00:00:50.940> blender<00:00:51.120> at<00:00:51.390> the<00:00:51.480> bottom<00:00:51.780> of

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
I open up the blender at the bottom of

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.540 
I open up the blender at the bottom of
it<00:00:53.030> by<00:00:54.030> the<00:00:54.090> way<00:00:54.360> do<00:00:54.750> not<00:00:54.780> plug<00:00:55.260> this<00:00:55.410> in<00:00:55.680> I've

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
it by the way do not plug this in I've

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.790 
it by the way do not plug this in I've
done<00:00:56.879> that<00:00:57.059> you<00:00:57.600> want<00:00:57.840> to<00:00:57.960> kind<00:00:58.320> of<00:00:58.440> rip<00:00:58.620> the

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
done that you want to kind of rip the

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.500 
done that you want to kind of rip the
two<00:00:58.949> wires<00:00:59.219> out<00:00:59.489> to<00:00:59.699> connect<00:00:59.969> to<00:01:00.120> the<00:01:00.210> switch

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
two wires out to connect to the switch

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.170 
two wires out to connect to the switch
of<00:01:00.780> the<00:01:00.930> blenders<00:01:01.289> that<00:01:01.410> turn<00:01:01.620> it<00:01:01.710> on<00:01:02.000> we<00:01:03.000> will

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
of the blenders that turn it on we will

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.950 
of the blenders that turn it on we will
wire<00:01:03.600> them<00:01:03.870> as<00:01:03.960> two<00:01:04.170> wires<00:01:04.379> up<00:01:04.739> to<00:01:05.100> this<00:01:05.220> relay

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:05.960 
wire them as two wires up to this relay

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:09.620 
wire them as two wires up to this relay
this<00:01:06.960> is<00:01:07.140> a<00:01:07.170> single-pole<00:01:07.770> double-throw<00:01:08.210> relay

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
this is a single-pole double-throw relay

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.760 
this is a single-pole double-throw relay
oh<00:01:09.680> yeah<00:01:10.680> and<00:01:11.610> then<00:01:12.390> we<00:01:12.479> just<00:01:12.630> wire<00:01:13.049> the<00:01:13.409> relay

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
oh yeah and then we just wire the relay

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.580 
oh yeah and then we just wire the relay
up<00:01:13.920> to<00:01:14.070> the<00:01:14.189> motor<00:01:14.430> output<00:01:14.880> from<00:01:15.150> a<00:01:15.270> Spiro<00:01:17.420> boom

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:18.590 
up to the motor output from a Spiro boom

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:22.370 
up to the motor output from a Spiro boom
on<00:01:19.590> there<00:01:20.040> as<00:01:20.570> dangerous<00:01:21.570> as<00:01:21.810> this<00:01:21.930> is<00:01:22.170> we're

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
on there as dangerous as this is we're

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:29.990 
on there as dangerous as this is we're
just<00:01:22.530> gonna<00:01:22.619> plug<00:01:22.890> this<00:01:23.070> in

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.870 

so<00:01:31.000> this<00:01:31.240> is<00:01:31.420> the<00:01:32.070> innards<00:01:33.070> of<00:01:33.370> your<00:01:33.670> old

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:33.880 
so this is the innards of your old

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:36.660 
so this is the innards of your old
blender<00:01:34.450> limbo<00:01:35.230> and<00:01:35.620> we've<00:01:36.160> got<00:01:36.280> a<00:01:36.310> sparrow

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:36.670 
blender limbo and we've got a sparrow

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:42.150 
blender limbo and we've got a sparrow
hanging<00:01:37.030> out<00:01:37.150> the<00:01:37.300> bottom<00:01:37.660> here<00:01:37.900> boy<00:01:38.710> golly<00:01:41.160> we

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:42.160 
hanging out the bottom here boy golly we

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:44.100 
hanging out the bottom here boy golly we
actually<00:01:42.490> have<00:01:42.610> direct<00:01:42.970> access<00:01:43.240> to<00:01:43.600> the<00:01:43.840> motor

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:44.110 
actually have direct access to the motor

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:46.140 
actually have direct access to the motor
commands<00:01:44.440> through<00:01:44.740> macro<00:01:45.100> lab<00:01:45.340> I'm<00:01:45.970> gonna

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:46.150 
commands through macro lab I'm gonna

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:50.990 
commands through macro lab I'm gonna
make<00:01:46.360> a<00:01:46.390> macro

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.600 

and<00:01:52.000> once<00:01:52.240> you've<00:01:52.480> connected<00:01:53.260> everything<00:01:53.650> up

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.810 

you're<00:01:57.610> going<00:01:57.730> to<00:01:57.790> need<00:01:57.970> to<00:01:58.830> hide<00:01:59.830> it<00:02:00.040> so<00:02:00.670> that

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:00.820 
you're going to need to hide it so that

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:02.700 
you're going to need to hide it so that
nobody<00:02:01.119> can<00:02:01.210> see<00:02:01.270> the<00:02:01.510> Sphero<00:02:01.750> put<00:02:02.530> your

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:02.710 
nobody can see the Sphero put your

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:05.880 
nobody can see the Sphero put your
redbull<00:02:03.010> there<00:02:03.220> and<00:02:03.810> crank<00:02:04.810> away<00:02:05.080> go<00:02:05.619> on<00:02:05.650> at

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:05.890 
redbull there and crank away go on at

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:16.460 
redbull there and crank away go on at
the<00:02:05.950> free<00:02:06.160> redbull

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:29.460 

that's<00:02:17.220> not<00:02:17.370> working

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:29.470 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:31.809 

this<00:02:30.470> is<00:02:30.620> a<00:02:30.650> cantaloupe<00:02:31.220> it<00:02:31.400> looks<00:02:31.580> like<00:02:31.790> a

00:02:31.809 --> 00:02:31.819 
this is a cantaloupe it looks like a

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:34.120 
this is a cantaloupe it looks like a
coconut
