a look at the thin fit satin silver
finish<00:00:42.960> model<00:00:43.320> my<00:00:43.530> first<00:00:43.770> impressions<00:00:44.309> of<00:00:44.430> the

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
finish model my first impressions of the

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.100 
finish model my first impressions of the
case<00:00:44.730> is<00:00:44.940> that<00:00:45.059> I<00:00:45.090> like<00:00:45.270> the<00:00:45.390> satin<00:00:45.629> silver

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
case is that I like the satin silver

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.020 
case is that I like the satin silver
finish<00:00:46.469> and<00:00:46.649> it<00:00:46.980> reminds<00:00:47.309> me<00:00:47.489> of<00:00:47.579> a<00:00:47.670> bumper

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
finish and it reminds me of a bumper

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.400 
finish and it reminds me of a bumper
style<00:00:48.300> case<00:00:48.570> that<00:00:48.809> would<00:00:48.930> be<00:00:48.960> on<00:00:49.140> a<00:00:49.170> phone

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
style case that would be on a phone

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.010 
style case that would be on a phone
rather<00:00:50.070> than<00:00:50.160> a<00:00:50.280> full<00:00:50.579> fledged<00:00:50.910> case<00:00:51.270> next<00:00:51.840> up

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
rather than a full fledged case next up

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.600 
rather than a full fledged case next up
let's<00:00:52.140> take<00:00:52.320> a<00:00:52.379> closer<00:00:52.649> look<00:00:52.890> at<00:00:53.039> the<00:00:53.160> thin<00:00:53.370> fit

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
let's take a closer look at the thin fit

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.760 
let's take a closer look at the thin fit

this<00:00:55.890> particular<00:00:56.190> case<00:00:56.579> spigen<00:00:57.120> has<00:00:57.300> several

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
this particular case spigen has several

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:58.939 
this particular case spigen has several
different<00:00:57.989> colors<00:00:58.230> to<00:00:58.410> choose<00:00:58.469> from

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
different colors to choose from

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.099 
different colors to choose from
including<00:00:59.190> a<00:00:59.910> black<00:01:00.180> model<00:01:00.570> as<00:01:00.750> well<00:01:00.960> as<00:01:01.020> a

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
including a black model as well as a

including a black model as well as a
clear<00:01:01.469> model<00:01:01.680> now<00:01:02.219> I<00:01:02.250> got<00:01:02.430> the<00:01:02.579> 42<00:01:03.030> millimeter

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
clear model now I got the 42 millimeter

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.390 
clear model now I got the 42 millimeter
Space<00:01:03.809> Gray<00:01:04.110> Apple<00:01:04.530> watch<00:01:04.680> sport<00:01:05.100> that

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
Space Gray Apple watch sport that

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.219 
Space Gray Apple watch sport that
obviously<00:01:05.850> comes<00:01:06.090> with<00:01:06.270> a<00:01:06.299> black<00:01:06.600> sports<00:01:06.960> band

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
obviously comes with a black sports band

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.800 
obviously comes with a black sports band
so<00:01:07.950> with<00:01:08.310> this<00:01:08.460> being<00:01:08.640> all<00:01:08.850> black<00:01:09.119> these<00:01:09.510> color

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
so with this being all black these color

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.450 
so with this being all black these color
combinations<00:01:10.080> are<00:01:10.680> gonna<00:01:10.799> match<00:01:11.070> a<00:01:11.250> little

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
combinations are gonna match a little

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.100 
combinations are gonna match a little
bit<00:01:11.580> easier<00:01:11.880> than<00:01:12.119> if<00:01:12.240> you<00:01:12.360> had<00:01:12.510> perhaps<00:01:12.780> a

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
bit easier than if you had perhaps a

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.380 
bit easier than if you had perhaps a
pink<00:01:13.439> blue<00:01:13.799> or<00:01:14.130> green<00:01:14.369> band<00:01:14.640> so<00:01:14.970> as<00:01:15.240> you've

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
pink blue or green band so as you've

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.359 
pink blue or green band so as you've
seen<00:01:15.540> installation<00:01:16.320> of<00:01:16.500> the<00:01:16.590> case<00:01:16.799> itself<00:01:17.189> is

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
seen installation of the case itself is

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.219 
seen installation of the case itself is
extremely<00:01:17.880> simple<00:01:18.150> all<00:01:18.570> you<00:01:18.720> have<00:01:18.840> to<00:01:18.960> do<00:01:19.110> is

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
extremely simple all you have to do is

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:20.960 
extremely simple all you have to do is
simply<00:01:19.560> place<00:01:19.710> the<00:01:20.009> case<00:01:20.220> over<00:01:20.490> the<00:01:20.670> front<00:01:20.880> of

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
simply place the case over the front of

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.670 
simply place the case over the front of
the<00:01:21.060> watch<00:01:21.240> and<00:01:21.450> it<00:01:21.570> slides<00:01:21.840> over<00:01:22.140> the<00:01:22.350> edges

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
the watch and it slides over the edges

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.560 
the watch and it slides over the edges
this<00:01:23.070> case<00:01:23.400> is<00:01:23.640> extremely<00:01:24.150> thin<00:01:24.390> and

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
this case is extremely thin and

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.149 
this case is extremely thin and
lightweight<00:01:24.750> and<00:01:25.290> it<00:01:25.409> definitely<00:01:25.590> looks<00:01:26.009> like

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
lightweight and it definitely looks like

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:27.560 
lightweight and it definitely looks like
it'll<00:01:26.400> protect<00:01:26.549> the<00:01:26.880> Apple<00:01:27.210> watch's<00:01:27.540> screen

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
it'll protect the Apple watch's screen

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.810 
it'll protect the Apple watch's screen
if<00:01:28.259> you<00:01:28.409> happen<00:01:28.740> to<00:01:28.770> bump<00:01:28.950> it<00:01:29.189> now<00:01:29.549> that<00:01:29.700> we've

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
if you happen to bump it now that we've

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.460
