00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:24.880 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:26.460 

I<00:00:24.970> think<00:00:25.300> it's<00:00:25.390> fair<00:00:25.539> to<00:00:25.660> say<00:00:25.689> whoever<00:00:26.199> this

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:26.470 
I think it's fair to say whoever this

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:29.729 
I think it's fair to say whoever this
goes<00:00:26.679> against<00:00:27.900> but<00:00:28.900> if<00:00:28.990> it's<00:00:29.140> Leinster<00:00:29.560> that's

00:00:29.729 --> 00:00:29.739 
goes against but if it's Leinster that's

00:00:29.739 --> 00:00:34.790 
goes against but if it's Leinster that's
that's<00:00:30.009> the<00:00:30.160> game<00:00:30.340> really<00:00:30.699> for<00:00:30.849> them

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:31.430 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:36.830 

what<00:02:32.430> I<00:02:32.460> saw<00:02:32.930> her<00:02:33.930> blue<00:02:34.290> rubbing<00:02:34.950> head<00:02:35.640> on<00:02:36.570> nine

what I saw her blue rubbing head on nine

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:41.150 
what I saw her blue rubbing head on nine
Queens<00:02:37.730> nine<00:02:38.730> Queens<00:02:39.060> punching<00:02:39.810> him<00:02:39.990> in<00:02:40.260> a

00:02:49.089 --> 00:02:49.099 

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:52.089 

we've<00:02:49.610> got<00:02:49.819> one<00:02:50.030> more<00:02:50.180> replay<00:02:50.599> that<00:02:50.780> I<00:02:51.099> think

00:02:52.089 --> 00:02:52.099 
we've got one more replay that I think

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:54.150 
we've got one more replay that I think
might

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:54.160 
might

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:56.070 
might
add<00:02:54.460> to<00:02:54.700> our<00:02:54.730> understanding<00:02:55.090> of<00:02:55.450> what<00:02:55.510> started

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:56.080
