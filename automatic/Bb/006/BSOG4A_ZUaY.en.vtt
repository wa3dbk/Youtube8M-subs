this is if you've done a defrag in your
VM<00:00:23.100> or<00:00:23.460> you've<00:00:23.820> added<00:00:24.029> a<00:00:24.210> lot<00:00:24.330> of<00:00:24.480> software<00:00:24.869> and

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
VM or you've added a lot of software and

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.920 
VM or you've added a lot of software and
you've<00:00:25.949> decided<00:00:26.279> that<00:00:26.519> since<00:00:26.849> you've<00:00:27.539> added<00:00:27.750> a

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
lot of software it's a good idea to

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.860 
lot of software it's a good idea to
