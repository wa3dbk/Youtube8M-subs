00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680
 hello to you tray today we will 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.330
 unpack the second collectible 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:11.580
 publications more precisely a special building 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:15.320
 prototype 2 prototype up to 2 which i 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.320
 also recently bought with tomb raider 

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:23.250
 worth one thousand one hundred rubles, and probably 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.619
 you understand why I bought in probably here 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:30.630
 rear 3 screenshots 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:33.630
 the hunt begins in principle because of this 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:39.390
 I guess maybe I bought but not a fact 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:41.930
 so well let's open it so 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:46.370
 let's put 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:50.399
 opens on us just like 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:52.079
 tomb raider that is , but in such 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:55.379
 Unlike the tomb raider we don't have it here. 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:59.219
 Screenshot of Artek someone, although it is clear 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:04.320
 why is the third so well then falls off 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:10.200
 we figure James Hiller main 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:14.869
 characters from the game and you won't believe it 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:17.750
 steelbook metal steve 

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:19.590
 stylized under very cool 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:21.840
 stylized in fact that is 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:26.250
 red color so here combined with 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:27.060
 black and white very cool cards very 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:31.189
 satisfied 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.189
 sickly let's start with steel book 

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:38.299
 so here we immediately drive under 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:42.679
 which does not have an activation code 

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:43.520
 activation is located under the manual more precisely 

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:46.189
 on the other side 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:48.020
 this is our extra materials are not 

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:53.140
 I know what is possible diaries 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:53.140
 developers and the manual itself 

00:01:55.329 --> 00:01:59.959
 black White 

00:01:56.829 --> 00:02:02.659
 small on the back of which 

00:01:59.959 --> 00:02:05.630
 is the activation key in the steam will not 

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:07.849
 happy show even that is even 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:12.500
 turn over here this we had 

00:02:07.849 --> 00:02:14.480
 steelbook further we probably go 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:17.090
 the most important component of this this 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:19.220
 Collectibles is a figurine 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:24.530
 James Hiller main characters from 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:26.239
 games why I didn't unpack something 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:30.620
 there is a show like a film I shoot everything 

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:33.110
 where I regretted that I did not 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:34.610
 do it because you have no idea 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:38.260
 how hard it is to open 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:41.690
 This is the main character that is a box 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:44.959
 it was a lot I don't know on video 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:49.989
 it was generally kapets sealing good 

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:49.989
 I wish I could have you pull it out 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:03:09.160
 cardboard and I apologize that I was born and 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:09.160
 actually she figure James body 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:20.349
 try it looks everyone got it 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:36.700
 it is not very stable because 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:42.079
 probably by the time it is worth it 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:48.699
 try to focus now yes you can 

00:03:42.079 --> 00:03:48.699
 see that paris scoop very soundly 

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:56.110
 very similar to the main characters then 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:58.240
 There is certainly a toy with 

00:03:56.110 --> 00:04:06.190
 Chinese market which in childhood were 

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:08.910
 but done think but very soundly then 

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:11.890
 there are these claws this is very cool 

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:15.040
 the main thing is not to break well, and in general 

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:17.260
 Of course it's a pity that without a stand of course 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:18.130
 because it will not be very stable 

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:21.070
 stand on the shelf 

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:24.400
 but anyway, I think it will be very 

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:27.120
 such a nice collectible gift 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:29.500
 edition if you and will stand 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:33.730
 the main character and especially if you 

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:37.960
 are you a prototype fan well it was 

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:41.820
 all that was part of this edition, let me 

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:47.370
 I will remove these boxes which stood 

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:55.120
 the main character so now 

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:57.600
 box in general about something like that 

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:57.600
 everything looks 

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:06.490
 focus well here as i said 

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:10.990
 At the beginning this edition cost me 1100 

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:13.360
 rubles, I did not regret it 

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:16.659
 took because 

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:17.250
 I liked me very much the first 

00:05:16.659 --> 00:05:20.530
 prototype 

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:23.289
 In the second prototype, I did not play at all 

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:25.919
 I looked at night did not like 

00:05:23.289 --> 00:05:30.099
 because the same as in the first 

00:05:25.919 --> 00:05:33.490
 Now programs may be my opinion 

00:05:30.099 --> 00:05:35.919
 will change with respect to the game and 

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:37.229
 here planted a collector such 

00:05:35.919 --> 00:05:40.360
 surprise as steelbook 

00:05:37.229 --> 00:05:44.080
 that's the main characters figure that 

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:45.719
 very cool well it was all with 

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:47.319
