hello just doing some maintenance here

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:10.070 
hello just doing some maintenance here
on<00:00:04.910> my<00:00:05.910> board<00:00:07.880> as<00:00:08.880> you<00:00:09.120> probably<00:00:09.420> saw<00:00:09.570> my<00:00:09.870> first

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.080 
on my board as you probably saw my first

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.650 
on my board as you probably saw my first
video<00:00:10.290> it<00:00:11.190> was<00:00:11.340> nice<00:00:11.670> and<00:00:11.700> shiny<00:00:12.360> and

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
video it was nice and shiny and

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.470 
video it was nice and shiny and
beautiful<00:00:13.019> and<00:00:13.530> everything<00:00:14.099> you<00:00:15.089> ever<00:00:15.120> wished

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
beautiful and everything you ever wished

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.980 
beautiful and everything you ever wished
for<00:00:16.279> but<00:00:17.279> of<00:00:17.369> course<00:00:17.609> all<00:00:18.000> the<00:00:18.539> things<00:00:18.750> have<00:00:18.930> to

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
for but of course all the things have to

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.200 
for but of course all the things have to
come<00:00:19.050> to<00:00:19.289> an<00:00:19.320> end<00:00:19.760> thus<00:00:20.760> my<00:00:21.410> the<00:00:22.410> board<00:00:22.680> has

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:23.210 
come to an end thus my the board has

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:26.509 
come to an end thus my the board has
turned<00:00:24.210> brown<00:00:24.539> from<00:00:25.199> white<00:00:25.439> to<00:00:25.470> brown<00:00:25.740> then

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
turned brown from white to brown then

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:29.990 
turned brown from white to brown then
this<00:00:27.269> typical<00:00:27.750> of<00:00:28.130> this<00:00:29.130> little<00:00:29.460> design<00:00:29.760> here

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
this typical of this little design here

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.759 
this typical of this little design here
of<00:00:30.119> course<00:00:30.179> if<00:00:30.510> you<00:00:30.599> have<00:00:30.630> white<00:00:31.289> grip<00:00:31.529> tape

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
of course if you have white grip tape

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:34.340 
of course if you have white grip tape
bro<00:00:32.329> whiteboard<00:00:33.329> or<00:00:33.450> anything<00:00:33.899> that's<00:00:33.989> white

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
bro whiteboard or anything that's white

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.590 
bro whiteboard or anything that's white
even<00:00:34.770> white<00:00:35.010> shirts<00:00:35.399> you<00:00:35.790> get<00:00:35.940> stains<00:00:36.300> on<00:00:36.570> it

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
even white shirts you get stains on it

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:42.970 
even white shirts you get stains on it
and<00:00:38.210> you<00:00:39.210> know<00:00:39.530> it's<00:00:41.149> basically<00:00:42.149> ruined

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:42.980 
and you know it's basically ruined

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:45.950 
and you know it's basically ruined
temporarily<00:00:43.980> to<00:00:44.879> wash<00:00:45.149> it<00:00:45.360> off<00:00:45.510> of<00:00:45.690> course

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
temporarily to wash it off of course

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.600 
temporarily to wash it off of course
that's<00:00:46.559> what<00:00:46.739> I'm<00:00:46.860> going<00:00:46.980> to<00:00:47.010> be<00:00:47.100> doing<00:00:47.250> here

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
that's what I'm going to be doing here

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.319 
that's what I'm going to be doing here
just<00:00:48.239> going<00:00:48.360> to<00:00:48.510> be<00:00:48.600> watching<00:00:49.020> this<00:00:49.140> off<00:00:49.379> I

00:00:50.319 --> 00:00:50.329 
just going to be watching this off I

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:54.619 
just going to be watching this off I

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
guess with napkins or well not napkins

00:00:54.629 --> 00:01:00.680 
guess with napkins or well not napkins
and<00:00:55.140> he's<00:00:55.260> a<00:00:55.289> hose<00:00:55.590> or<00:00:57.079> just<00:00:58.079> water<00:00:58.320> so<00:00:59.690> if

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
and he's a hose or just water so if

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:01.970 
and he's a hose or just water so if
you're<00:01:00.780> going<00:01:00.870> to<00:01:00.930> rub<00:01:01.079> your<00:01:01.199> board<00:01:01.469> down<00:01:01.680> or

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
you're going to rub your board down or

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.369 
you're going to rub your board down or
clean<00:01:02.460> it<00:01:02.579> up<00:01:02.730> it's<00:01:03.570> best<00:01:03.750> to<00:01:03.870> take<00:01:03.989> the<00:01:04.110> trucks

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
clean it up it's best to take the trucks

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.710 
clean it up it's best to take the trucks
everything<00:01:04.890> off<00:01:05.220> that<00:01:06.119> way<00:01:06.270> you<00:01:06.360> don't<00:01:06.540> mess

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
everything off that way you don't mess

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.719 
everything off that way you don't mess
up<00:01:06.750> your<00:01:06.990> bearings<00:01:07.380> or<00:01:08.840> basically<00:01:10.250> yeah<00:01:11.250> just

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
up your bearings or basically yeah just

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.929 
up your bearings or basically yeah just
mess<00:01:11.970> up<00:01:12.000> your<00:01:12.240> bearings<00:01:13.640> you<00:01:14.640> just<00:01:14.760> want<00:01:14.909> to

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
mess up your bearings you just want to

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:17.210 
mess up your bearings you just want to
isolate<00:01:15.060> board<00:01:15.509> of<00:01:15.750> course<00:01:16.200> pretty<00:01:17.040> sure<00:01:17.159> all

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
isolate board of course pretty sure all

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.730 
isolate board of course pretty sure all
y'all<00:01:17.670> know<00:01:17.939> how<00:01:18.210> to<00:01:19.610> take<00:01:20.610> part<00:01:20.820> the<00:01:20.939> trucks

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:21.740 
y'all know how to take part the trucks

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:27.020 
y'all know how to take part the trucks
um<00:01:23.810> of<00:01:24.810> course<00:01:24.869> the<00:01:25.310> angle<00:01:26.310> riser<00:01:26.520> pads<00:01:26.880> were

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
um of course the angle riser pads were

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.200 
um of course the angle riser pads were
right<00:01:27.210> under<00:01:27.509> it<00:01:27.630> they<00:01:28.590> were<00:01:28.650> like<00:01:29.210> sponge

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
right under it they were like sponge

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:31.880 
right under it they were like sponge
right<00:01:30.540> on<00:01:30.750> there<00:01:30.960> didn't<00:01:31.500> want<00:01:31.650> to<00:01:31.710> come<00:01:31.860> off

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
right on there didn't want to come off

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.319 
right on there didn't want to come off
so<00:01:32.490> you<00:01:32.700> had<00:01:32.850> had<00:01:33.360> it<00:01:33.479> like<00:01:33.600> rip<00:01:33.810> them<00:01:33.930> off<00:01:34.189> as

00:01:35.319 --> 00:01:35.329 
so you had had it like rip them off as

00:01:35.329 --> 00:01:38.660 
so you had had it like rip them off as
you<00:01:36.329> probably<00:01:36.630> assume<00:01:37.320> you'll<00:01:38.070> probably<00:01:38.310> find

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
you probably assume you'll probably find

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:43.219 
you probably assume you'll probably find
out<00:01:38.909> or<00:01:39.150> you<00:01:39.840> know<00:01:40.049> already<00:01:41.630> the<00:01:42.630> back<00:01:42.899> bolts

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
out or you know already the back bolts

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:46.340 
out or you know already the back bolts
or<00:01:43.619> the<00:01:44.460> bolts<00:01:44.759> on<00:01:44.909> on<00:01:45.479> the<00:01:45.720> big<00:01:45.869> side<00:01:46.079> or

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
or the bolts on on the big side or

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.649 
or the bolts on on the big side or
longer<00:01:46.799> than<00:01:47.070> the<00:01:47.130> ones<00:01:47.310> in<00:01:47.430> the<00:01:47.490> front<00:01:47.670> and<00:01:48.060> of

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
longer than the ones in the front and of

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:51.109 
longer than the ones in the front and of
course<00:01:48.930> that's<00:01:49.320> so<00:01:49.649> you<00:01:49.710> can<00:01:49.799> just<00:01:50.090> you<00:01:51.090> know

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
course that's so you can just you know

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:54.730 
course that's so you can just you know
tighten<00:01:52.110> it<00:01:52.229> down<00:01:52.430> without<00:01:53.430> running<00:01:53.850> out<00:01:54.030> of

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:54.740 
tighten it down without running out of

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:58.670 
tighten it down without running out of
bolt<00:01:56.719> and<00:01:57.719> that's<00:01:57.869> pretty<00:01:57.990> much<00:01:58.110> it<00:01:58.229> for<00:01:58.469> now

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
bolt and that's pretty much it for now

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:02.300 
bolt and that's pretty much it for now
oh<00:01:59.960> yeah<00:02:00.960> the<00:02:01.350> only<00:02:01.560> other<00:02:01.590> thing<00:02:01.799> I<00:02:02.009> noticed

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
oh yeah the only other thing I noticed

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:03.800 
oh yeah the only other thing I noticed
with<00:02:02.399> board<00:02:02.610> is<00:02:02.759> a<00:02:02.790> well<00:02:03.329> it's<00:02:03.420> not<00:02:03.479> the<00:02:03.540> board

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
with board is a well it's not the board

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.889 
with board is a well it's not the board
it's<00:02:04.079> the<00:02:04.530> wheels<00:02:04.799> and<00:02:04.890> bearings<00:02:05.630> of<00:02:06.630> course

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
it's the wheels and bearings of course

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:08.990 
it's the wheels and bearings of course
the<00:02:07.020> outside<00:02:07.409> gets<00:02:07.619> way<00:02:07.799> dirtier<00:02:08.250> than<00:02:08.789> the

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
the outside gets way dirtier than the

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.640 
the outside gets way dirtier than the
inside<00:02:09.360> right<00:02:09.539> here<00:02:09.780> but<00:02:10.500> in<00:02:10.770> between<00:02:11.120> the

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:12.650 
inside right here but in between the

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:15.220 
inside right here but in between the
2<00:02:12.829> outside<00:02:13.760> bearings<00:02:14.390> on<00:02:14.629> the<00:02:14.780> inside<00:02:15.079> where

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230 
2 outside bearings on the inside where

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:17.740 
2 outside bearings on the inside where
the<00:02:15.319> spacer<00:02:15.769> is<00:02:15.950> it's<00:02:16.760> relatively<00:02:17.269> like

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:17.750 
the spacer is it's relatively like

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:21.250 
the spacer is it's relatively like
always<00:02:18.170> clean<00:02:18.519> well<00:02:19.519> like<00:02:20.329> almost<00:02:20.870> almost

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260 
always clean well like almost almost

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.039 
always clean well like almost almost
clean<00:02:21.819> so<00:02:22.819> not<00:02:23.390> much<00:02:23.510> to<00:02:23.689> worry<00:02:23.840> about<00:02:23.900> that

00:02:24.039 --> 00:02:24.049 
clean so not much to worry about that
