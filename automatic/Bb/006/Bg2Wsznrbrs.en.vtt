00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:21.470
 awaited with help from game rama 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:24.060
 It was from there that I took this tutorial 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:26.790

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:30.240
 a pc drive in your xbox classic rock 

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:33.600
 the first box xbox does not live with 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:35.760
 360 that will not take in the face 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.250
 Everyone who knows me knows that I 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:41.070
 I recommend 10 thousand times you buy one 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:43.050
 hd is to put in your xbox and pass the 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:46.200
 cute games by ftp 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:48.060
 but if you want to put the pc drive 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.290
 so you can play on the disc since 

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:50.790
 You have many says that you are with 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:53.850
 laziness to do all the times of 

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:57.930
 get to the xbox at last let's get started 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:01:00.420
 with the patifaria soon as well first let's go 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.399
 advantages the main advantage is that 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.649
 You will not have any more problems with media. 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:07.049
 any media type and even voter 

00:01:04.649 --> 00:01:09.990
 16 times much faster than 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:12.240
 xbox original voter come now let's go 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.580
 disadvantages that are significant 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.900
 first that will not read original game 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.270
 unless you have a drive from the 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.850
 samsung with updated firmware there 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:24.420
 maybe in law and it is necessary to use 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:26.310
 a new get button and for some consoles 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.930
 to play the game you need 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.700
 ask northeast board is not able to boot 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.520
 to gecko in the game is there inside the 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:40.020
 trailer means that we will need clear 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:44.369
 xbox torque wrench 20 and 10 cable and power 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:46.350
 the idea drive of pc solder strange light 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:50.490
 and preferably also free apache 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:52.320
 drizzle thin cute little knife to 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:55.979
 We can close the conversation. 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:02:00.080
 heat it and also have sawdust 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:02.670
 also that you can use knife place 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:04.560
 The first step is to remove the reader 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:07.440
 xbox together with the power cord 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:09.780
 yellow there and then remove this 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:13.170
 front of the front of the reader. 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:14.880
 of xbox you will put in the utah well 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:16.470
 then you will take the front part of the 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:18.090
 pc reader too it will stay 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:21.720
 similar to xbox for you 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:23.490
 fit that front there, if you stay 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:25.140
 disproportionate you can break a 

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:29.160
 little piece collapse important question 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:31.110
 What fits you looks cute is you 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:33.330
 want to paint in black also the drawer 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:36.990
 It's no problem, just paint careful with 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:39.510
 Ethical inks come after and weld the 

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:41.520
 button wires as in the figure and that 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:43.709
 You see, you can see. 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:46.650
 that an audio club was used 

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:49.230
 placed on the back of the drive and a 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:53.190
 audio cable that comes with the dvd itself 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:55.110
 1 dp sia ok and now comes the part 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:57.120
 complicated you need to do 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:59.130
 some cash comparisons and with the 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:00.720
 drawer you have in case of the lg drive 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:02.370
 you have to make a small cut of the 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:03.930
 right side of the drawer as it is 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:05.700
 showing the image right 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:07.860
 But you see here is better for you. 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:09.989
 Like I said the important thing is to stay 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:15.360
 well coladinho well right very cute 

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:17.820
 is that trampoline dung well the result 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:21.570
 end should be compared to this to iacc 

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:23.190
 wonder as I said at the beginning 

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:25.380
 some modifications need to be made 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:27.510
 inside your xbox you will have to 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:29.430
 sacrifice some pins as you are 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:32.220
 seeing the image pay attention if it is 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:34.290
 right where the saw or the 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:37.110
 Hot Saw Knife You Can Heat Up 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:39.810
 she gives you the chance to cut that 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:41.940
 thorn leave the end result this 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:44.610
 How are you? 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:47.250
 cute and we're almost there 

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:49.200
 in this part you can use the pc button 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:50.700
 even to make adaptation the threads 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:53.100
 that you will use you can use a 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:55.500
 little mouse old son of 

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:58.140
 preference is the mouse is perfect for 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:59.850
 This is a drill, it's something else that 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:01.980
 you can stick to the side where you 

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:05.280
 want - xbox to make a new button 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:07.560
 get and the strange soldering iron and peace 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:08.910
 had as I said you can 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:11.360
 use your question is worth to 

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:14.630
 jett collaboration and the strange weld 

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:16.640
 and d highway solder paste 

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:19.730
 well now we're almost done 

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:21.799
 just pick up the power cord and put it 

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:23.690
 there on the cable that comes from the source I adapt 

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:26.540
 and there and it will be duplicate 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:28.670
 Then you connect one end to the other wpc 

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:30.890
 tip on the drive and the idea of rh 

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:33.830
 True, he's going to get this wonder. 

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:35.960
 All pretty little monkeys for you. 

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:37.430
 remembering that the left screw does not 

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:40.790
 will be needed more because people 

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:42.500
 missed the line of his performance there you 

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:45.200

 eject of the original xbox has put eject 

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:49.070

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:51.620

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:09.169
 if he got a glue or some other 

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:11.510
 waste and just play well remembering that
