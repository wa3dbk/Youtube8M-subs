reveal friend of mine came across this

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:18.380 
reveal friend of mine came across this
at<00:00:16.139> Twitter<00:00:16.650> this<00:00:16.860> year<00:00:17.070> and<00:00:17.280> the<00:00:17.880> company<00:00:18.270> was

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
at Twitter this year and the company was

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.210 
at Twitter this year and the company was
nice<00:00:18.600> enough<00:00:18.900> to<00:00:18.960> send<00:00:19.350> us<00:00:19.560> some<00:00:19.740> sample

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
nice enough to send us some sample

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.460 
nice enough to send us some sample
prototype<00:00:20.880> products<00:00:21.420> on<00:00:22.289> this

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
prototype products on this

prototype products on this
patent-pending<00:00:23.009> process<00:00:24.109> so<00:00:25.109> essentially<00:00:25.830> it

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
patent-pending process so essentially it

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:33.220 
patent-pending process so essentially it
comes<00:00:26.220> in<00:00:26.759> a<00:00:26.849> kit<00:00:27.710> with<00:00:28.710> drawing<00:00:29.460> paper<00:00:31.400> and

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:33.230 
comes in a kit with drawing paper and

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:42.220 
comes in a kit with drawing paper and
transfers<00:00:35.180> and<00:00:36.180> six<00:00:36.539> pencils<00:00:38.030> how<00:00:39.030> it<00:00:39.180> works

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:42.230 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:45.200 

take<00:00:43.230> this<00:00:43.440> transfer<00:00:44.129> we<00:00:44.460> use<00:00:44.789> the<00:00:44.940> stencil

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
take this transfer we use the stencil

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:54.830 
take this transfer we use the stencil
for<00:00:45.570> today<00:00:49.579> stenciling<00:00:50.579> something<00:00:53.570> it<00:00:54.570> allows

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
for today stenciling something it allows

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:00.049 
for today stenciling something it allows
you<00:00:55.050> to<00:00:55.199> draw<00:00:55.949> a<00:00:56.570> picture<00:00:57.570> on<00:00:58.640> this<00:00:59.640> specially

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
you to draw a picture on this specially

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:04.009 
you to draw a picture on this specially
formulated<00:01:00.359> pen<00:01:00.930> paper<00:01:02.149> and<00:01:03.149> transfer<00:01:03.870> it

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
formulated pen paper and transfer it

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.960 
formulated pen paper and transfer it
into<00:01:04.260> a<00:01:04.500> reposition<00:01:05.309> it<00:01:05.400> will<00:01:05.550> cling<00:01:07.790> in<00:01:08.790> an

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
into a reposition it will cling in an

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.840 
into a reposition it will cling in an
omni<00:01:09.360> or<00:01:09.479> image<00:01:09.869> which<00:01:10.799> I<00:01:10.979> thought<00:01:11.189> was<00:01:11.280> really

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
omni or image which I thought was really

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.300 
omni or image which I thought was really
cool<00:01:12.860> it's<00:01:13.860> really<00:01:13.950> easy<00:01:14.549> to<00:01:14.700> use<00:01:14.820> it<00:01:15.420> doesn't

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:16.310 
cool it's really easy to use it doesn't

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:20.060 
cool it's really easy to use it doesn't
require<00:01:17.310> any<00:01:17.640> chemicals<00:01:18.270> or<00:01:18.630> any<00:01:19.070> special

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
require any chemicals or any special

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.859 
require any chemicals or any special
process<00:01:22.189> and<00:01:23.189> I<00:01:24.000> think<00:01:24.060> it's<00:01:24.450> going<00:01:24.659> to<00:01:24.720> be

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
process and I think it's going to be

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:28.039 
process and I think it's going to be
pretty<00:01:25.079> big<00:01:26.420> I'm<00:01:27.420> going<00:01:27.600> to<00:01:27.720> show<00:01:27.810> you<00:01:27.930> how

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
pretty big I'm going to show you how

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:32.530 
pretty big I'm going to show you how
this<00:01:28.229> works

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:32.540 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:34.690 

right<00:01:33.140> now<00:01:33.320> I'm<00:01:33.470> just<00:01:33.620> stenciling<00:01:34.220> in<00:01:34.460> I'm

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:34.700 
right now I'm just stenciling in I'm

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:42.900 
right now I'm just stenciling in I'm
using<00:01:35.390> the<00:01:35.630> BBL<00:01:36.050> pencils<00:01:37.810> this<00:01:39.460> reveal<00:01:40.460> paper

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:42.910 

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:46.210 

and<00:01:43.910> now<00:01:44.570> I'm<00:01:44.750> not<00:01:44.960> saying<00:01:45.380> after<00:01:45.890> you<00:01:46.040> is

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:46.220 
and now I'm not saying after you is

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:49.330 
and now I'm not saying after you is
actually<00:01:46.610> going<00:01:46.880> to<00:01:47.000> spell<00:01:47.210> fun<00:01:48.130> this<00:01:49.130> is

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:49.340 
actually going to spell fun this is

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:54.940 
actually going to spell fun this is
pretty<00:01:49.580> cool<00:01:51.310> so<00:01:52.310> I<00:01:52.340> pick<00:01:52.850> this<00:01:53.470> last<00:01:54.470> but<00:01:54.800> not

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:54.950 
pretty cool so I pick this last but not

00:01:54.950 --> 00:02:05.679 
pretty cool so I pick this last but not
least<00:01:58.210> over<00:01:59.210> here

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:05.689 

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:16.790 

so<00:02:07.300> your<00:02:08.300> picture

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.550 

see<00:02:17.580> this<00:02:17.730> process<00:02:18.300> then<00:02:19.080> what<00:02:19.260> I'm<00:02:19.380> going<00:02:19.500> to

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
see this process then what I'm going to

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:24.140 
see this process then what I'm going to
do<00:02:19.710> is<00:02:19.860> take<00:02:20.040> one<00:02:20.250> of<00:02:20.340> these<00:02:20.430> transfers<00:02:21.090> I<00:02:23.150> have

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
do is take one of these transfers I have

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:32.570 
do is take one of these transfers I have
the<00:02:24.390> package<00:02:24.630> here<00:02:29.810> and<00:02:30.810> it's<00:02:30.990> just<00:02:31.110> a<00:02:31.580> almost

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
the package here and it's just a almost

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:37.490 
the package here and it's just a almost
like<00:02:32.820> a<00:02:33.080> piece<00:02:34.080> of<00:02:34.110> contact<00:02:34.860> paper<00:02:35.100> a<00:02:36.500> little

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
like a piece of contact paper a little

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:42.200 
like a piece of contact paper a little
bit<00:02:37.650> different<00:02:38.220> adhesive<00:02:38.910> on<00:02:39.060> here<00:02:40.970> feel<00:02:41.970> the

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:42.210 
bit different adhesive on here feel the

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:46.880 
bit different adhesive on here feel the
contact<00:02:42.900> paper<00:02:43.110> off<00:02:43.440> of<00:02:43.470> the<00:02:43.680> paper<00:02:45.680> place<00:02:46.680> it

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
contact paper off of the paper place it

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:53.090 
contact paper off of the paper place it
over<00:02:47.070> the<00:02:47.280> top<00:02:47.370> of<00:02:47.820> the<00:02:47.970> drawing<00:02:51.950> take<00:02:52.950> the

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:53.100 
over the top of the drawing take the

00:02:53.100 --> 00:03:00.320 
over the top of the drawing take the
burnisher<00:02:54.650> just<00:02:58.130> any<00:02:59.130> on<00:02:59.430> the<00:02:59.580> areas<00:03:00.030> that<00:03:00.180> are

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:00.330 
burnisher just any on the areas that are

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:15.900 
burnisher just any on the areas that are
colored

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:15.910 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:21.850 

and<00:03:16.570> simply

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:21.860 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:29.400 

feel<00:03:22.520> the<00:03:22.760> picture<00:03:23.240> back<00:03:26.950> off<00:03:27.950> on<00:03:27.980> the<00:03:28.220> paper

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:29.410 
feel the picture back off on the paper

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:33.820 
feel the picture back off on the paper
it<00:03:30.410> makes<00:03:30.650> just<00:03:31.100> look<00:03:31.250> it<00:03:31.430> image<00:03:31.970> of<00:03:32.960> the

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:33.830 
it makes just look it image of the

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:37.510 
it makes just look it image of the
original<00:03:34.010> drawing<00:03:36.100> one<00:03:37.100> of<00:03:37.190> the<00:03:37.250> cool<00:03:37.490> things

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:37.520 
original drawing one of the cool things

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:40.540 
original drawing one of the cool things
about<00:03:37.880> them<00:03:38.560> post<00:03:39.560> transfers<00:03:40.160> it<00:03:40.400> has<00:03:40.520> a

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:40.550 
about them post transfers it has a

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:42.570 
about them post transfers it has a
little<00:03:40.880> bit<00:03:41.030> of<00:03:41.120> stick<00:03:41.390> a<00:03:41.420> visa<00:03:41.720> to<00:03:42.020> it<00:03:42.140> still

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:42.580 
little bit of stick a visa to it still

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:46.990 
little bit of stick a visa to it still
so<00:03:43.580> it's<00:03:43.760> easy<00:03:44.030> to<00:03:44.600> place<00:03:45.170> it<00:03:45.410> on<00:03:45.620> top<00:03:45.920> of<00:03:46.220> other

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:47.000 
so it's easy to place it on top of other

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:52.960 
so it's easy to place it on top of other
surfaces<00:03:48.640> when<00:03:49.640> it's<00:03:49.760> all<00:03:49.940> done<00:03:50.260> and<00:03:51.970> actually

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:52.970 
surfaces when it's all done and actually

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:55.510 
surfaces when it's all done and actually
transfer<00:03:53.540> different<00:03:53.990> things<00:03:54.230> I<00:03:54.530> think<00:03:55.370> this

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:55.520 
transfer different things I think this

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:58.090 
transfer different things I think this
is<00:03:55.700> actually<00:03:55.850> really<00:03:56.420> cool<00:03:56.810> and<00:03:57.590> different

00:03:58.090 --> 00:03:58.100 
is actually really cool and different

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:03.729 
is actually really cool and different
but<00:03:58.490> it<00:03:58.610> peels<00:03:58.940> right<00:03:59.360> off<00:04:00.250> and<00:04:01.250> leaves<00:04:02.739> no

00:04:03.729 --> 00:04:03.739 
but it peels right off and leaves no

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:08.530 
but it peels right off and leaves no
residue<00:04:05.890> the<00:04:06.890> unique<00:04:07.190> thing<00:04:07.459> is<00:04:07.640> now<00:04:07.820> kids<00:04:08.209> are

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:08.540 
residue the unique thing is now kids are

residue the unique thing is now kids are
artists<00:04:09.440> I<00:04:09.620> should<00:04:09.830> say<00:04:10.040> crafters<00:04:10.610> can<00:04:10.970> take

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:11.720 
artists I should say crafters can take

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:15.070 
artists I should say crafters can take
this<00:04:11.989> and<00:04:12.340> it's<00:04:13.340> not<00:04:13.580> a<00:04:13.610> mirror<00:04:14.390> image<00:04:14.660> where

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:15.080 
this and it's not a mirror image where

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:17.440 
this and it's not a mirror image where
usually<00:04:15.470> you<00:04:15.920> have<00:04:16.070> to<00:04:16.160> draw<00:04:16.370> backwards<00:04:16.910> this

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:17.450 
usually you have to draw backwards this

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:20.259 
usually you have to draw backwards this
allows<00:04:17.810> you<00:04:17.959> to<00:04:17.989> draw<00:04:18.320> regular<00:04:19.190> and<00:04:19.430> peel<00:04:20.239> it

00:04:20.259 --> 00:04:20.269 
allows you to draw regular and peel it

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:23.050 
allows you to draw regular and peel it
off<00:04:20.480> and<00:04:20.720> then<00:04:20.810> put<00:04:21.049> it<00:04:21.169> on<00:04:21.260> other<00:04:21.530> surfaces<00:04:22.130> it

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:23.060 
off and then put it on other surfaces it

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:26.950 
off and then put it on other surfaces it
also<00:04:23.270> works<00:04:23.660> in<00:04:23.870> on<00:04:24.080> ceramics<00:04:25.419> quite<00:04:26.419> easily

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:26.960 
also works in on ceramics quite easily

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:29.140 
also works in on ceramics quite easily
you<00:04:27.770> could<00:04:27.919> just<00:04:28.070> take<00:04:28.310> it<00:04:28.340> and<00:04:28.610> place<00:04:28.850> it<00:04:29.030> on

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:29.150 
you could just take it and place it on

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:32.290 
you could just take it and place it on
top<00:04:29.330> of<00:04:29.390> a<00:04:29.600> plate<00:04:29.840> or<00:04:30.110> a<00:04:30.530> mug<00:04:31.340> or<00:04:31.729> whatever<00:04:32.030> and

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:32.300 
top of a plate or a mug or whatever and

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:34.540 
top of a plate or a mug or whatever and
then<00:04:32.419> you<00:04:33.410> don't<00:04:33.590> want<00:04:33.740> on<00:04:33.890> there<00:04:34.070> peels<00:04:34.370> right

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:34.550 
then you don't want on there peels right

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:39.820 
then you don't want on there peels right
off<00:04:35.290> works<00:04:36.290> on<00:04:36.500> fabric<00:04:36.979> as<00:04:37.160> well<00:04:38.229> so<00:04:39.229> that<00:04:39.620> is

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:39.830 
off works on fabric as well so that is

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:44.170 
off works on fabric as well so that is
drawing<00:04:40.669> transfer<00:04:42.130> that's<00:04:43.130> now<00:04:43.400> one<00:04:44.030> of<00:04:44.120> the

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:44.180 
drawing transfer that's now one of the

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:46.630 
drawing transfer that's now one of the
cool<00:04:44.390> thing
