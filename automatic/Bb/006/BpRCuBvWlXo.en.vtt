when we do the restorations that we

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:01.500 
when we do the restorations that we
overdo<00:02:57.100> them<00:02:57.280> and<00:02:58.320> so<00:02:59.320> that's<00:02:59.850> all<00:03:00.850> left<00:03:01.360> to

to<00:03:18.760> make<00:03:19.510> that<00:03:19.720> a<00:03:19.750> hundred<00:03:19.930> pointer<00:03:20.470> and<00:03:20.920> I

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:21.190 
to make that a hundred pointer and I

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:23.509 
to make that a hundred pointer and I
think<00:03:21.459> it<00:03:21.550> would<00:03:21.670> greatly<00:03:21.910> enhance<00:03:22.360> the

think it would greatly enhance the
