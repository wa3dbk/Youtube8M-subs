now<00:00:04.529> we're<00:00:04.680> going<00:00:04.799> to<00:00:04.859> go<00:00:04.980> to<00:00:05.009> what<00:00:05.220> we<00:00:05.339> call<00:00:05.580> a

00:00:05.599 --> 00:00:05.609 
now we're going to go to what we call a

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:09.080 
now we're going to go to what we call a
three-point<00:00:06.480> dribble<00:00:06.960> or<00:00:07.140> a<00:00:07.610> moving<00:00:08.610> dribble

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.090 
three-point dribble or a moving dribble

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:10.940 
three-point dribble or a moving dribble
we're<00:00:09.690> going<00:00:09.780> to<00:00:09.840> have<00:00:09.990> this<00:00:10.170> line<00:00:10.440> face<00:00:10.740> this

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:10.950 
we're going to have this line face this

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:16.160 
we're going to have this line face this
way<00:00:11.160> again<00:00:12.410> and<00:00:13.759> what<00:00:14.759> they<00:00:14.910> will<00:00:15.089> do<00:00:15.360> is<00:00:15.690> still

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
way again and what they will do is still

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:17.689 
way again and what they will do is still
bring<00:00:16.440> their<00:00:16.560> left<00:00:16.770> hand<00:00:17.039> out<00:00:17.220> in<00:00:17.250> front<00:00:17.400> of

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
bring their left hand out in front of

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:20.150 
bring their left hand out in front of
them<00:00:17.880> but<00:00:18.840> this<00:00:19.050> time<00:00:19.289> instead<00:00:19.560> of<00:00:19.740> dribbling

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
them but this time instead of dribbling

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:21.679 
them but this time instead of dribbling
just<00:00:20.400> straight<00:00:20.670> up<00:00:20.699> and<00:00:21.029> down<00:00:21.060> they're<00:00:21.510> going

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
just straight up and down they're going

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:23.120 
just straight up and down they're going
to<00:00:21.840> move<00:00:22.050> the<00:00:22.199> ball<00:00:22.230> in<00:00:22.650> all<00:00:22.859> different

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
to move the ball in all different

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.429 
to move the ball in all different
directions<00:00:23.310> this<00:00:24.269> is<00:00:24.420> our<00:00:24.570> moving<00:00:24.840> dribble

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
directions this is our moving dribble

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.560 
directions this is our moving dribble
this<00:00:26.189> is<00:00:26.340> where<00:00:26.519> they<00:00:26.609> learn<00:00:26.789> to<00:00:27.000> control<00:00:27.180> the

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
this is where they learn to control the

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.990 
this is where they learn to control the
ball<00:00:27.779> under<00:00:28.109> pressure<00:00:28.410> when<00:00:29.369> defense<00:00:29.849> is

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
ball under pressure when defense is

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.429 
ball under pressure when defense is
putting<00:00:30.300> pressure<00:00:30.449> on<00:00:30.750> them<00:00:31.050> they<00:00:31.199> can<00:00:31.349> learn

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
putting pressure on them they can learn

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.170 
putting pressure on them they can learn
to<00:00:31.560> control<00:00:31.710> it<00:00:31.980> and<00:00:32.250> keep<00:00:32.489> their<00:00:32.700> eyes<00:00:32.850> up

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
to control it and keep their eyes up

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.360 
to control it and keep their eyes up
let's<00:00:34.050> try<00:00:34.260> that<00:00:34.440> with<00:00:34.590> the<00:00:34.710> moving<00:00:35.040> dribble

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
let's try that with the moving dribble

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.100 
let's try that with the moving dribble
and<00:00:35.550> our<00:00:35.700> partners<00:00:35.940> will<00:00:36.570> really<00:00:36.870> have<00:00:36.989> to

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
and our partners will really have to

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:38.660 
and our partners will really have to
concentrate<00:00:37.140> on<00:00:37.710> getting<00:00:37.860> your<00:00:38.070> eyes<00:00:38.219> up<00:00:38.489> now

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
concentrate on getting your eyes up now

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.940 
concentrate on getting your eyes up now
left<00:00:39.480> hands<00:00:39.719> out<00:00:41.210> go<00:00:42.469> move<00:00:43.469> the<00:00:43.590> ball<00:00:43.770> all

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
left hands out go move the ball all

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.819 
left hands out go move the ball all
around<00:00:44.750> dribble<00:00:45.750> it<00:00:45.809> hard<00:00:46.079> you<00:00:46.559> got<00:00:46.710> to

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
around dribble it hard you got to

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.880 
around dribble it hard you got to
dribble<00:00:47.039> it<00:00:47.160> hard<00:00:48.140> go<00:00:49.140> higher<00:00:49.350> than<00:00:49.379> you<00:00:49.710> need

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
dribble it hard go higher than you need

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.979 
dribble it hard go higher than you need
yeah<00:00:50.340> knee<00:00:50.610> high<00:00:50.760> right<00:00:51.030> there<00:00:51.239> move<00:00:51.750> it<00:00:51.870> all

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
yeah knee high right there move it all

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:56.810 
yeah knee high right there move it all
over<00:00:54.620> now<00:00:55.620> once<00:00:55.860> we<00:00:56.039> add<00:00:56.190> movement<00:00:56.520> to<00:00:56.789> the

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
over now once we add movement to the

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.069 
over now once we add movement to the
dribble<00:00:57.300> it<00:00:57.390> becomes<00:00:57.719> a<00:00:57.840> little<00:00:57.989> more

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
dribble it becomes a little more

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.020 
dribble it becomes a little more
difficult<00:00:58.399> and<00:00:59.399> they<00:00:59.520> have<00:00:59.670> to<00:00:59.820> learn<00:00:59.969> to

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
difficult and they have to learn to

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:08.520 
difficult and they have to learn to
concentrate<00:01:00.329> on<00:01:00.840> this

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:08.530 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:12.760 

stop<00:01:10.000> let's<00:01:11.000> turn<00:01:11.240> the<00:01:11.390> other<00:01:11.510> way<00:01:11.600> now<00:01:12.590> we'll

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:12.770 
stop let's turn the other way now we'll

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:15.640 
stop let's turn the other way now we'll
work<00:01:12.950> on<00:01:13.130> our<00:01:13.280> left<00:01:13.490> hand<00:01:14.230> works<00:01:15.230> on<00:01:15.380> our<00:01:15.500> left

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:15.650 
work on our left hand works on our left

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:17.440 
work on our left hand works on our left
hand<00:01:15.950> this<00:01:16.430> becomes<00:01:16.850> a<00:01:16.970> little<00:01:17.120> bit<00:01:17.300> more

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:17.450 
hand this becomes a little bit more

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:19.570 
hand this becomes a little bit more
difficult<00:01:17.690> when<00:01:18.680> you<00:01:18.830> have<00:01:18.860> to<00:01:19.070> move<00:01:19.220> the<00:01:19.280> ball

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:19.580 
difficult when you have to move the ball

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:22.540 
difficult when you have to move the ball
around<00:01:19.930> so<00:01:20.930> I<00:01:21.350> think<00:01:21.650> if<00:01:22.070> you<00:01:22.220> ought<00:01:22.340> to<00:01:22.430> do

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:22.550 
around so I think if you ought to do

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:25.720 
around so I think if you ought to do
this<00:01:22.730> drill<00:01:22.910> for<00:01:23.180> at<00:01:23.270> least<00:01:23.360> about<00:01:24.490> you<00:01:25.490> got<00:01:25.640> to

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:25.730 
this drill for at least about you got to

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:27.850 
this drill for at least about you got to
do<00:01:25.790> this<00:01:25.880> bill<00:01:26.120> for<00:01:26.300> 60<00:01:26.630> seconds<00:01:27.050> the<00:01:27.830> first

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:27.860 
do this bill for 60 seconds the first

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:29.800 
do this bill for 60 seconds the first
grill<00:01:28.370> you<00:01:28.490> can<00:01:28.550> do<00:01:28.760> for<00:01:28.940> 30<00:01:29.180> seconds<00:01:29.630> on<00:01:29.750> each

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:29.810 
grill you can do for 30 seconds on each

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:31.510 
grill you can do for 30 seconds on each
hand<00:01:30.080> is<00:01:30.290> a<00:01:30.320> warm-up<00:01:30.740> this<00:01:31.040> one<00:01:31.280> you<00:01:31.400> ought<00:01:31.430> to

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:31.520 
hand is a warm-up this one you ought to

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:33.550 
hand is a warm-up this one you ought to
do<00:01:31.700> for<00:01:31.910> six<00:01:32.120> per<00:01:32.270> seconds<00:01:32.720> before<00:01:32.870> you<00:01:33.140> rotate
