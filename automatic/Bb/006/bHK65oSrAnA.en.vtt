this<00:01:31.560> is<00:01:31.740> cool<00:01:31.950> cuz<00:01:32.159> they're<00:01:32.340> blind<00:01:32.579> they're

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
this is cool cuz they're blind they're

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.340 
this is cool cuz they're blind they're
mystery<00:01:33.659> and<00:01:34.369> out<00:01:35.369> of<00:01:35.909> the<00:01:36.119> six<00:01:36.420> we<00:01:36.750> have<00:01:36.960> three

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
mystery and out of the six we have three

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.830 
mystery and out of the six we have three
that<00:01:37.770> you<00:01:37.950> can<00:01:38.250> see<00:01:38.549> and<00:01:39.140> out<00:01:40.140> of<00:01:40.259> these<00:01:40.470> three

00:06:08.869 --> 00:06:08.879 
got his bandana on underneath what

00:06:08.879 --> 00:06:11.899 
got his bandana on underneath what
levels<00:06:09.210> this<00:06:09.389> one<00:06:09.629> in<00:06:10.310> we<00:06:11.310> might<00:06:11.490> not<00:06:11.580> have<00:06:11.639> all

00:06:11.899 --> 00:06:11.909 
levels this one in we might not have all

00:06:11.909 --> 00:06:13.399 
levels this one in we might not have all
the<00:06:12.029> levels<00:06:12.360> we<00:06:12.599> might<00:06:12.750> have<00:06:12.870> to<00:06:12.960> play<00:06:13.139> some<00:06:13.349> of

00:06:13.399 --> 00:06:13.409 
the levels we might have to play some of

00:06:13.409 --> 00:06:15.499 
the levels we might have to play some of
the<00:06:13.500> other<00:06:13.620> versions<00:06:14.159> of<00:06:14.370> doodle<00:06:14.849> jump<00:06:15.060> yeah

00:06:15.499 --> 00:06:15.509 
the other versions of doodle jump yeah

00:06:15.509 --> 00:06:18.589 
the other versions of doodle jump yeah
so<00:06:16.500> I<00:06:16.529> guess<00:06:16.650> it's<00:06:16.919> my<00:06:17.069> turn<00:06:17.129> I<00:06:17.550> think<00:06:18.419> that's

00:06:18.589 --> 00:06:18.599 
so I guess it's my turn I think that's

00:06:18.599 --> 00:06:21.920 
so I guess it's my turn I think that's
it<00:06:18.779> and<00:06:18.960> then<00:06:19.139> we're<00:06:19.349> done<00:06:19.529> I<00:06:19.830> got<00:06:20.819> dr.<00:06:21.629> lair

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:21.930 
it and then we're done I got dr. lair

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:23.929 
it and then we're done I got dr. lair

we'll be getting any more unless maybe a
series<00:07:04.670> two<00:07:04.880> comes<00:07:05.150> out<00:07:05.390> because<00:07:06.020> it<00:07:06.320> might<00:07:06.470> be

00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:06.560 
series two comes out because it might be

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:08.680 
series two comes out because it might be
too<00:07:06.590> easy<00:07:06.800> to<00:07:07.010> get<00:07:07.130> some<00:07:07.310> doubles<00:07:07.700> so<00:07:08.270> I<00:07:08.300> mean

because it has the mystery you know I

00:07:30.290 --> 00:07:32.290 
because it has the mystery you know I
guess<00:07:30.650> yeah<00:07:31.040> but<00:07:31.220> then<00:07:31.370> I<00:07:31.400> guess<00:07:31.760> if<00:07:31.970> we<00:07:32.120> get

00:07:32.290 --> 00:07:32.300 
guess yeah but then I guess if we get

00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:39.340 
guess yeah but then I guess if we get
that<00:07:35.200> because<00:07:36.200> then<00:07:36.380> we<00:07:36.590> get<00:07:36.770> only<00:07:37.010> to<00:07:37.450> get<00:07:38.450> 350

00:07:39.340 --> 00:07:39.350 
that because then we get only to get 350

00:07:39.350 --> 00:07:40.720 
that because then we get only to get 350
