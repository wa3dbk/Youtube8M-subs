this<00:00:05.430> is<00:00:05.759> the<00:00:06.150> c500<00:00:06.660> versus<00:00:07.319> film<00:00:07.649> latitude

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:08.639 
this is the c500 versus film latitude

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:13.190 
this is the c500 versus film latitude
test<00:00:09.030> where<00:00:09.960> we<00:00:10.160> overexpose<00:00:11.160> and<00:00:11.960> this<00:00:12.960> is

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
test where we overexpose and this is

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.250 
test where we overexpose and this is
just<00:00:14.040> like<00:00:14.219> we<00:00:14.429> left<00:00:14.730> the<00:00:15.299> test<00:00:15.599> with<00:00:16.109> the

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
just like we left the test with the

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.890 
just like we left the test with the
dynamic<00:00:16.800> range<00:00:17.010> of<00:00:17.430> the<00:00:17.539> backlit<00:00:18.539> clouds

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
dynamic range of the backlit clouds

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.730 
dynamic range of the backlit clouds
you're<00:00:19.320> really<00:00:19.619> gonna<00:00:19.770> see<00:00:20.029> film<00:00:21.029> just<00:00:21.779> kick<00:00:22.500> a

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
you're really gonna see film just kick a

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.929 
you're really gonna see film just kick a
bootay<00:00:23.600> and<00:00:24.600> this<00:00:25.019> test<00:00:25.320> as<00:00:25.590> well<00:00:25.769> so<00:00:26.609> here<00:00:26.820> we

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
bootay and this test as well so here we

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.419 
bootay and this test as well so here we
have<00:00:27.090> film<00:00:27.449> at<00:00:27.840> plus<00:00:28.650> zero<00:00:29.039> so<00:00:29.310> that's

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
have film at plus zero so that's

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:32.930 
have film at plus zero so that's
basically<00:00:30.000> right<00:00:30.449> on<00:00:30.660> exposure<00:00:31.260> and<00:00:31.940> we're

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
basically right on exposure and we're

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.799 
basically right on exposure and we're
gonna<00:00:33.059> go<00:00:33.420> up<00:00:33.719> in<00:00:34.079> third<00:00:34.410> stop<00:00:34.800> increments

00:00:35.799 --> 00:00:35.809 
gonna go up in third stop increments

a third you know but again the way film

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.420 
a third you know but again the way film
reacts<00:01:50.340> is<00:01:50.670> it<00:01:50.790> doesn't<00:01:51.149> clip<00:01:51.540> out<00:01:51.750> it<00:01:52.200> it<00:01:52.740> over
