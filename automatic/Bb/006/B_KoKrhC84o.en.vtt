00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:56.050 
I think the reason so many people have
connected<00:01:54.979> to<00:01:55.130> it<00:01:55.250> is<00:01:55.369> because<00:01:55.729> it's

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:56.060 
connected to it is because it's

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:57.429 
connected to it is because it's
something<00:01:56.329> you<00:01:56.390> can<00:01:56.539> identify<00:01:56.689> with<00:01:57.170> it's

00:01:57.429 --> 00:01:57.439 
something you can identify with it's

00:01:57.439 --> 00:01:59.949 
something you can identify with it's
very<00:01:57.530> much<00:01:57.979> about<00:01:58.130> belonging<00:01:58.909> somewhere<00:01:59.719> and

00:01:59.949 --> 00:01:59.959 
very much about belonging somewhere and

00:01:59.959 --> 00:02:01.569 
very much about belonging somewhere and
making<00:02:00.259> that<00:02:00.530> choice<00:02:00.799> and<00:02:01.100> making<00:02:01.429> that

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:01.579 
making that choice and making that

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:03.340 
making that choice and making that
commitment<00:02:01.850> there's<00:02:02.689> a<00:02:02.750> hell<00:02:02.899> of<00:02:02.929> a<00:02:03.049> lot<00:02:03.170> to<00:02:03.259> be

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:03.350
