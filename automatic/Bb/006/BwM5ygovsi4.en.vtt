today we're gonna have a video on
checking<00:00:02.790> your<00:00:02.909> valve<00:00:03.120> clearances<00:00:03.830> probably

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:04.830 
checking your valve clearances probably

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:06.740 
checking your valve clearances probably
not<00:00:04.980> going<00:00:05.160> to<00:00:05.310> adjust<00:00:05.640> my<00:00:05.790> valves<00:00:06.270> but<00:00:06.540> I'm

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:06.750 
not going to adjust my valves but I'm

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:07.880 
not going to adjust my valves but I'm
going<00:00:06.899> to<00:00:06.960> show<00:00:07.080> you<00:00:07.170> how<00:00:07.290> to<00:00:07.319> check<00:00:07.710> the

going to show you how to check the

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:11.480 
going to show you how to check the
clearances<00:00:09.530> well<00:00:10.530> I'll<00:00:10.830> explain<00:00:11.010> the<00:00:11.250> steps

into<00:00:11.849> adjusting<00:00:12.360> them<00:00:12.480> it's<00:00:12.630> it's<00:00:13.380> fairly

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
into adjusting them it's it's fairly

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.390 
into adjusting them it's it's fairly
straightforward<00:00:15.560> somewhat<00:00:16.560> but<00:00:17.100> anyway

all figured out

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.209

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
to top dead center which I've got

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.060 
to top dead center which I've got
another<00:00:45.750> video<00:00:45.930> I'll<00:00:46.379> probably<00:00:46.590> put<00:00:46.800> a<00:00:46.860> link

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
another video I'll probably put a link

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.279 
another video I'll probably put a link
to<00:00:47.219> that<00:00:47.250> below<00:00:47.870> but<00:00:48.870> you've<00:00:48.960> got<00:00:49.079> to<00:00:49.170> have<00:00:49.260> a

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
to that below but you've got to have a

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:52.160 
to that below but you've got to have a
TDC<00:00:50.070> top<00:00:50.340> dead<00:00:50.550> center<00:00:50.850> the<00:00:51.329> easiest<00:00:51.570> way<00:00:51.840> is

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
TDC top dead center the easiest way is

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.709 
TDC top dead center the easiest way is
if<00:00:52.980> you<00:00:53.100> have<00:00:53.219> a<00:00:53.250> stock<00:00:53.579> cover<00:00:53.879> there's<00:00:54.539> an

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
if you have a stock cover there's an

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.959 
if you have a stock cover there's an
inspection<00:00:55.050> window<00:00:55.379> there<00:00:55.800> the<00:00:56.250> line<00:00:56.460> line

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
inspection window there the line line

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.139 
inspection window there the line line
those<00:00:57.149> up<00:00:57.360> for<00:00:57.629> TDC<00:00:58.219> another<00:00:59.219> way<00:00:59.430> to<00:00:59.489> check<00:00:59.969> it

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
those up for TDC another way to check it

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:03.439 
those up for TDC another way to check it
if<00:01:00.809> sending<00:01:01.440> your<00:01:01.739> time<00:01:02.100> correctly<00:01:02.579> or<00:01:03.120> your

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
if sending your time correctly or your

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:06.560 
if sending your time correctly or your
your<00:01:03.930> dots<00:01:04.309> will<00:01:05.309> both<00:01:05.519> be<00:01:05.670> facing<00:01:06.090> up<00:01:06.210> then

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
your dots will both be facing up then

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:07.700 
your dots will both be facing up then
you'll<00:01:06.720> have<00:01:06.780> your<00:01:06.960> other<00:01:07.049> dot<00:01:07.260> this<00:01:07.500> way

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
you'll have your other dot this way

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.880 
you'll have your other dot this way
facing<00:01:08.159> that<00:01:08.400> way<00:01:09.110> and<00:01:10.110> then<00:01:10.290> the<00:01:10.409> last<00:01:10.560> way<00:01:10.860> to

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
facing that way and then the last way to

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.130 
facing that way and then the last way to
verify<00:01:11.850> that<00:01:11.880> your<00:01:12.270> top<00:01:12.420> dead<00:01:12.630> center<00:01:12.900> we're

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
verify that your top dead center we're

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:14.359 
verify that your top dead center we're
gonna<00:01:13.260> go<00:01:13.320> ahead<00:01:13.439> and<00:01:13.650> go<00:01:13.710> around<00:01:13.860> the<00:01:14.280> other

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
gonna go ahead and go around the other

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:20.179 
gonna go ahead and go around the other
side<00:01:14.490> here<00:01:16.430> is<00:01:18.320> on<00:01:19.320> the<00:01:19.439> other<00:01:19.530> side<00:01:19.830> here

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
side here is on the other side here

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:23.810 
side here is on the other side here
which<00:01:20.340> is<00:01:20.520> world<00:01:20.729> will<00:01:20.850> be<00:01:20.970> mostly<00:01:21.570> working<00:01:22.820> is

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
which is world will be mostly working is

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.440 
which is world will be mostly working is
your<00:01:24.119> earlobes<00:01:25.049> and<00:01:25.409> your<00:01:25.799> cams<00:01:26.070> you<00:01:26.430> can<00:01:27.240> get

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:29.960 
gonna get that feeler gauge out what you

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:33.640 
gonna get that feeler gauge out what you
want<00:02:30.140> to<00:02:30.200> do<00:02:30.350> is<00:02:30.590> take<00:02:31.070> it<00:02:31.510> and<00:02:32.510> put<00:02:33.410> it<00:02:33.500> under

them<00:02:43.660> barely<00:02:45.280> touch<00:02:46.300> so<00:02:47.300> so<00:02:47.750> far<00:02:47.960> we're

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:48.140 
them barely touch so so far we're

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:51.580 
them barely touch so so far we're
looking<00:02:48.440> good<00:02:49.480> cuz<00:02:50.480> that<00:02:50.600> was<00:02:50.690> a<00:02:50.750> point<00:02:51.050> one

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:51.590 
looking good cuz that was a point one

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:53.950 
looking good cuz that was a point one
two<00:02:51.800> zero<00:02:52.000> which<00:02:53.000> was<00:02:53.180> a<00:02:53.240> little<00:02:53.390> too<00:02:53.600> big<00:02:53.810> for

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:53.960 
two zero which was a little too big for

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:57.970 
two zero which was a little too big for
that<00:02:54.340> and<00:02:55.340> that's<00:02:55.700> a<00:02:55.850> millimeters<00:02:56.770> we<00:02:57.770> need

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:57.980 
that and that's a millimeters we need

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:05.910 
that and that's a millimeters we need
something<00:02:58.370> a<00:02:58.400> little<00:02:58.640> smaller<00:03:00.220> there<00:03:01.220> we<00:03:01.310> go

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:05.920 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:13.449 

right<00:03:06.920> here<00:03:11.920> there<00:03:12.920> we<00:03:13.010> go

right here there we go
I'm<00:03:14.300> gonna<00:03:14.450> use<00:03:14.570> that<00:03:14.720> for<00:03:14.780> all<00:03:15.020> three<00:03:15.380> of<00:03:15.410> them

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:15.650 
I'm gonna use that for all three of them

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:19.530 
I'm gonna use that for all three of them
the<00:03:16.400> other<00:03:16.520> one<00:03:16.580> they're<00:03:16.880> good<00:03:17.660> they're<00:03:18.040> in

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:19.540 
the other one they're good they're in

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:23.410 
the other one they're good they're in
blast<00:03:20.540> load<00:03:21.880> plate<00:03:22.880> and<00:03:23.060> they'll<00:03:23.150> be<00:03:23.239> able<00:03:23.300> to

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:23.420 
blast load plate and they'll be able to

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:25.720 
blast load plate and they'll be able to
see<00:03:23.570> that<00:03:23.750> but<00:03:24.530> anyway<00:03:24.830> these<00:03:25.220> are<00:03:25.400> all<00:03:25.520> good

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:25.730 
see that but anyway these are all good

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:43.790 
millimeters giver gauge up and do the

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:45.610 
millimeters giver gauge up and do the
same<00:03:44.000> thing<00:03:44.239> if<00:03:44.480> you<00:03:44.600> could<00:03:44.720> see<00:03:44.959> this<00:03:45.440> one's

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:45.620 
same thing if you could see this one's

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:47.729 
same thing if you could see this one's
gonna<00:03:45.739> be<00:03:45.920> easier<00:03:46.190> to<00:03:46.310> see

00:03:47.729 --> 00:03:47.739 
gonna be easier to see

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:50.520 
gonna be easier to see
that's<00:03:48.739> perfect<00:03:49.190> there's<00:03:49.400> barely<00:03:49.880> catching

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:50.530 
that's perfect there's barely catching

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:52.810 
that's perfect there's barely catching
see<00:03:51.530> not<00:03:51.650> taking<00:03:51.950> that<00:03:52.010> feeler<00:03:52.340> gauge<00:03:52.610> and

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:52.820 
see not taking that feeler gauge and

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:56.770 
see not taking that feeler gauge and
just<00:03:53.140> going<00:03:54.140> right<00:03:54.320> under<00:03:54.650> there<00:03:55.630> see<00:03:56.630> them

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:56.780 
just going right under there see them

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:59.500 
just going right under there see them
below<00:03:57.350> there<00:03:57.890> and<00:03:58.670> we've<00:03:58.820> got<00:03:59.000> our<00:03:59.090> other<00:03:59.239> one

00:03:59.500 --> 00:03:59.510 
below there and we've got our other one

below there and we've got our other one
which<00:03:59.810> is<00:03:59.930> right<00:04:00.110> here<00:04:00.310> same<00:04:01.310> thing<00:04:01.640> yeah<00:04:02.630> that

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:02.660 
which is right here same thing yeah that

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:05.229 
which is right here same thing yeah that
one's<00:04:02.959> absolutely<00:04:03.440> perfect<00:04:03.940> and<00:04:04.940> that's<00:04:05.150> how

00:04:05.229 --> 00:04:05.239 
one's absolutely perfect and that's how

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:08.199 
one's absolutely perfect and that's how
you<00:04:05.300> check<00:04:05.540> your<00:04:05.750> clearances<00:04:06.940> kind<00:04:07.940> of<00:04:08.030> really

00:04:08.199 --> 00:04:08.209 
you check your clearances kind of really

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:10.300 
you check your clearances kind of really
hard<00:04:08.360> to<00:04:08.480> get<00:04:08.600> this<00:04:08.720> on<00:04:08.930> video<00:04:09.080> me<00:04:09.620> zoom<00:04:10.130> in<00:04:10.280> a

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:10.310 
hard to get this on video me zoom in a

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:13.080 
hard to get this on video me zoom in a
bit<00:04:10.400> so<00:04:10.940> you<00:04:11.900> get<00:04:12.019> the<00:04:12.170> load<00:04:12.320> there

them<00:05:22.030> hopefully<00:05:22.690> within<00:05:22.990> spec<00:05:23.350> then<00:05:24.039> you're

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:24.160 
them hopefully within spec then you're

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:29.070 
them hopefully within spec then you're

I believe if not to let me know maybe I

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:02.760 
I believe if not to let me know maybe I
can<00:06:01.450> put<00:06:01.750> something<00:06:01.960> together<00:06:02.200> eventually
