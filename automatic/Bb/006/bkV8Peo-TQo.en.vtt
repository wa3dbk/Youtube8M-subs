was a boat and then these cars are its

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:39.270 
was a boat and then these cars are its
wake<00:02:36.970> that's<00:02:37.600> right<00:02:37.959> not<00:02:38.260> water<00:02:38.560> but<00:02:38.890> a<00:02:39.070> wake

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:39.280 
wake that's right not water but a wake

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:42.860 
wake that's right not water but a wake
of<00:02:39.660> 60,000<00:02:40.660> pounds

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
of 60,000 pounds

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:47.120 
of 60,000 pounds
it's<00:02:43.870> kind<00:02:44.140> of<00:02:44.170> poetic

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.130 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:49.350
