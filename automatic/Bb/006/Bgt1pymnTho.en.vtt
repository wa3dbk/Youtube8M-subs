00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:32.699 
this is it's the acid gap kit on mob of

00:00:32.699 --> 00:00:35.209 
this is it's the acid gap kit on mob of
the<00:00:32.730> dead<00:00:32.790> you<00:00:33.149> have<00:00:33.329> to<00:00:33.540> to<00:00:33.870> find<00:00:34.110> all<00:00:34.590> three

the dead you have to to find all three
parts<00:00:35.610> and<00:00:35.820> build<00:00:36.059> the<00:00:36.269> acid<00:00:36.659> gat<00:00:36.839> kit<00:00:37.110> and

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
parts and build the acid gat kit and

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.500 
parts and build the acid gat kit and
then<00:00:37.710> you<00:00:37.829> have<00:00:38.010> to<00:00:38.190> get<00:00:38.309> the<00:00:38.430> blundergat<00:00:38.760> put

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
then you have to get the blundergat put

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.600 
then you have to get the blundergat put
the<00:00:39.629> blender<00:00:39.930> gap<00:00:40.110> inside<00:00:40.860> of<00:00:41.070> the<00:00:41.159> kit<00:00:41.400> and

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
the blender gap inside of the kit and

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.420 
the blender gap inside of the kit and
the<00:00:42.269> kit<00:00:42.780> will<00:00:42.960> convert<00:00:43.379> it<00:00:43.500> into<00:00:43.649> the<00:00:43.949> acid

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
the kit will convert it into the acid

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.479 
the kit will convert it into the acid
yet<00:00:44.690> and<00:00:45.690> I<00:00:46.140> basically<00:00:46.320> scripted<00:00:47.129> this<00:00:47.280> whole

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
yet and I basically scripted this whole

00:00:56.179 --> 00:00:56.189 
the parts right here for now just for

00:00:56.189 --> 00:00:58.670 
the parts right here for now just for
testing<00:00:56.580> purposes<00:00:57.229> so<00:00:58.229> let's<00:00:58.409> go<00:00:58.500> ahead<00:00:58.530> and

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
testing purposes so let's go ahead and

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:06.020 
testing purposes so let's go ahead and
pick<00:00:58.890> up<00:00:59.040> these<00:00:59.220> parts<00:01:00.379> 1<00:01:01.460> 2<00:01:02.460> 3<00:01:04.700> so<00:01:05.700> let's<00:01:05.939> go

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
pick up these parts 1 2 3 so let's go

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.280 
pick up these parts 1 2 3 so let's go
over<00:01:06.060> here<00:01:06.210> and<00:01:06.270> add<00:01:06.479> it<00:01:06.630> add<00:01:06.810> this<00:01:07.049> to<00:01:07.200> the

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:23.069 

okay<00:01:19.899> so<00:01:19.960> when<00:01:20.229> you<00:01:20.320> add<00:01:20.500> all<00:01:20.530> three<00:01:20.950> parts<00:01:22.079> the

00:01:23.069 --> 00:01:23.079 
okay so when you add all three parts the

00:01:23.079 --> 00:01:25.499 
okay so when you add all three parts the
case<00:01:23.320> will<00:01:23.530> open<00:01:23.860> up<00:01:23.979> and<00:01:24.220> it<00:01:24.790> says<00:01:25.000> go<00:01:25.210> find

00:01:25.499 --> 00:01:25.509 
case will open up and it says go find

00:01:25.509 --> 00:01:28.529 
case will open up and it says go find
the<00:01:25.659> blender<00:01:25.960> gap<00:01:26.220> so<00:01:27.220> what<00:01:27.729> I<00:01:27.759> did<00:01:27.909> was<00:01:28.180> I<00:01:28.420> put

00:01:28.529 --> 00:01:28.539 
the blender gap so what I did was I put

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:31.469 
the blender gap so what I did was I put
a<00:01:28.750> broken<00:01:29.229> blundergat<00:01:29.619> online<00:01:30.189> that<00:01:30.399> I'm<00:01:31.299> not

00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:31.479 
a broken blundergat online that I'm not

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:33.300 
a broken blundergat online that I'm not
going<00:01:31.659> to<00:01:31.720> have<00:01:31.869> blended<00:01:32.289> get<00:01:32.560> on<00:01:32.740> my<00:01:32.890> map<00:01:33.070> as<00:01:33.250> a

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:33.310 
going to have blended get on my map as a

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:39.719 
going to have blended get on my map as a
weapon<00:01:33.630> I<00:01:36.689> basically<00:01:37.689> just<00:01:38.320> put<00:01:38.950> a<00:01:39.130> model<00:01:39.490> on

00:01:39.719 --> 00:01:39.729 
weapon I basically just put a model on

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:42.719 
weapon I basically just put a model on
the<00:01:39.789> map<00:01:40.080> apart<00:01:41.080> that<00:01:41.829> looks<00:01:42.130> like<00:01:42.280> a<00:01:42.340> blender

00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:42.729 
the map apart that looks like a blender

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:44.819 
the map apart that looks like a blender
get<00:01:42.909> and<00:01:43.149> you<00:01:43.240> have<00:01:43.360> to<00:01:43.450> go<00:01:43.570> find<00:01:43.810> it<00:01:44.020> which<00:01:44.679> is

00:01:44.819 --> 00:01:44.829 
get and you have to go find it which is

00:01:44.829 --> 00:01:46.740 
get and you have to go find it which is
right<00:01:45.009> here<00:01:45.039> I<00:01:45.520> just<00:01:46.060> put<00:01:46.210> it<00:01:46.299> right<00:01:46.329> there<00:01:46.450> for

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:46.750 
right here I just put it right there for

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:49.350 
right here I just put it right there for
testing<00:01:47.110> purposes<00:01:47.530> again<00:01:48.149> then<00:01:49.149> when<00:01:49.270> you

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:49.360 
testing purposes again then when you

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:54.059 
testing purposes again then when you
find<00:01:49.630> that<00:01:51.299> you<00:01:52.299> bring<00:01:52.509> it<00:01:52.659> back<00:01:52.840> to<00:01:53.350> the

00:01:54.059 --> 00:01:54.069 
find that you bring it back to the

00:01:54.069 --> 00:02:01.499 
find that you bring it back to the
workbench<00:01:59.009> I<00:02:00.009> could<00:02:00.880> have<00:02:01.000> made<00:02:01.090> it<00:02:01.149> so<00:02:01.450> you

00:02:01.499 --> 00:02:01.509 
workbench I could have made it so you

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:03.570 
workbench I could have made it so you
actually<00:02:02.080> you<00:02:02.920> don't<00:02:03.039> have<00:02:03.130> to<00:02:03.369> get<00:02:03.459> the

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:03.580 
actually you don't have to get the

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:05.460 
actually you don't have to get the
blundergat<00:02:03.909> out<00:02:04.179> the<00:02:04.360> box<00:02:04.599> and<00:02:04.929> then<00:02:05.170> stick<00:02:05.439> it

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:05.470 
blundergat out the box and then stick it

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:07.559 
blundergat out the box and then stick it
in<00:02:05.649> here<00:02:05.920> but<00:02:06.610> like<00:02:06.819> I<00:02:06.970> said<00:02:07.000> I'm<00:02:07.330> not<00:02:07.360> gonna

00:02:07.559 --> 00:02:07.569 
in here but like I said I'm not gonna

00:02:07.569 --> 00:02:10.610 
in here but like I said I'm not gonna
have<00:02:07.720> the<00:02:07.810> blender<00:02:08.080> get<00:02:08.229> on<00:02:08.349> my<00:02:08.500> map<00:02:08.709> so<00:02:09.009> I<00:02:09.039> I

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:10.620 
have the blender get on my map so I I

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:14.670 
have the blender get on my map so I I
didn't<00:02:11.620> want<00:02:11.769> to<00:02:11.860> make<00:02:11.950> it<00:02:12.099> that<00:02:12.280> way<00:02:13.620> okay<00:02:14.620> so

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:14.680 
didn't want to make it that way okay so

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:19.710 
didn't want to make it that way okay so
let's<00:02:14.980> go<00:02:15.069> ahead<00:02:15.099> and<00:02:15.220> add<00:02:15.400> the<00:02:15.549> blundergat<00:02:18.720> so

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720 
let's go ahead and add the blundergat so

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:30.400 
let's go ahead and add the blundergat so
now<00:02:19.870> the<00:02:19.930> case<00:02:20.200> is<00:02:20.230> going<00:02:20.500> to<00:02:20.590> close

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:30.410 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:35.330 

and<00:02:31.410> there<00:02:31.920> we<00:02:32.040> go<00:02:33.050> we<00:02:34.050> got<00:02:34.230> ourselves<00:02:34.350> an<00:02:34.920> acid

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
and there we go we got ourselves an acid

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:45.020 
and there we go we got ourselves an acid
gap

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:47.030 

Oh
