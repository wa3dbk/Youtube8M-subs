00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:47.320 
field to do this I've been doing more

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:48.780 
field to do this I've been doing more
than<00:00:47.350> a<00:00:47.500> few<00:00:47.650> paintball<00:00:48.070> fields<00:00:48.339> it<00:00:48.430> also<00:00:48.640> had

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:50.670 
than a few paintball fields it also had
a<00:00:48.820> rule<00:00:49.059> very<00:00:49.330> similar<00:00:49.659> to<00:00:49.720> this<00:00:49.900> you<00:00:50.110> lose<00:00:50.320> you

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:50.680 
a rule very similar to this you lose you

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:53.160 
a rule very similar to this you lose you
get<00:00:50.769> put<00:00:50.949> on<00:00:50.979> a<00:00:51.070> firing<00:00:51.519> squad<00:00:51.659> the<00:00:52.659> end<00:00:52.809> result

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:53.170 
get put on a firing squad the end result

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:55.920 
get put on a firing squad the end result
is<00:00:53.290> that<00:00:53.320> people<00:00:53.710> will<00:00:53.860> do<00:00:54.070> anything<00:00:54.360> to<00:00:55.360> not

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:55.930 
is that people will do anything to not

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:59.009 
is that people will do anything to not

lose so when I read similar responses to
my<00:00:59.110> last<00:00:59.320> video<00:00:59.619> how<00:00:59.830> failure<00:01:00.070> penalties<00:01:00.610> are

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:00.729 
my last video how failure penalties are

00:01:00.729 --> 00:01:02.490 
my last video how failure penalties are
necessary<00:01:01.150> i<00:01:01.239> read<00:01:01.720> a<00:01:01.750> lot<00:01:02.140> of<00:01:02.290> the<00:01:02.379> same

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:02.500 
necessary i read a lot of the same

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:04.740 
necessary i read a lot of the same
apologetics<00:01:03.220> at<00:01:03.339> these<00:01:03.460> fields<00:01:03.939> used<00:01:04.180> it's<00:01:04.629> a

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:04.750 
apologetics at these fields used it's a

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:06.600 
apologetics at these fields used it's a
deterrent<00:01:05.350> it<00:01:05.470> makes<00:01:05.619> people<00:01:05.770> play<00:01:06.159> better<00:01:06.430> it

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:06.610 
deterrent it makes people play better it

deterrent it makes people play better it
gives<00:01:06.790> people<00:01:07.090> a<00:01:07.119> reason<00:01:07.299> to<00:01:07.510> not<00:01:07.720> fail<00:01:08.460> that

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:09.460 
gives people a reason to not fail that

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:10.889 
gives people a reason to not fail that
answer<00:01:09.820> is<00:01:09.850> just<00:01:10.060> not<00:01:10.210> satisfying<00:01:10.750> to<00:01:10.869> me

00:01:10.889 --> 00:01:10.899 
answer is just not satisfying to me

00:01:10.899 --> 00:01:12.749 
answer is just not satisfying to me
because<00:01:11.109> it<00:01:11.380> rips<00:01:11.649> away<00:01:11.770> part<00:01:12.250> of<00:01:12.369> what<00:01:12.549> makes

00:01:12.749 --> 00:01:12.759 
because it rips away part of what makes

00:01:31.349 --> 00:01:31.359 
because this is not a really great venue

00:01:31.359 --> 00:01:33.480 
because this is not a really great venue
for<00:01:31.479> this<00:01:31.600> but<00:01:31.899> you<00:01:32.469> want<00:01:32.619> the<00:01:32.799> true<00:01:33.069> crime<00:01:33.340> is

in my eyes it creates this culture where

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:37.980 
in my eyes it creates this culture where
we're<00:01:35.770> afraid<00:01:36.009> to<00:01:36.249> fail<00:01:36.520> I<00:01:36.789> think<00:01:37.659> this<00:01:37.749> is<00:01:37.869> the

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:37.990 
we're afraid to fail I think this is the

we're afraid to fail I think this is the
largest<00:01:38.259> crime<00:01:38.469> of<00:01:38.649> all<00:01:38.710> because<00:01:38.920> you<00:01:39.700> learn

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:39.909 
largest crime of all because you learn

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:41.429 
largest crime of all because you learn
more<00:01:40.179> from<00:01:40.299> failure<00:01:40.810> than<00:01:40.990> you<00:01:41.079> do<00:01:41.170> a<00:01:41.200> victory

00:01:41.429 --> 00:01:41.439 
more from failure than you do a victory

00:01:41.439 --> 00:01:44.249 
more from failure than you do a victory
you<00:01:42.310> learn<00:01:42.520> why<00:01:42.999> things<00:01:43.450> don't<00:01:43.689> work<00:01:44.020> which

00:01:44.249 --> 00:01:44.259 
you learn why things don't work which

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:46.260 
you learn why things don't work which
often<00:01:44.649> offers<00:01:45.310> clarity<00:01:45.819> when<00:01:45.999> you<00:01:46.119> see

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:46.270 
often offers clarity when you see

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:48.090 
often offers clarity when you see
something<00:01:46.479> that<00:01:46.600> does<00:01:46.899> work<00:01:47.139> the<00:01:47.920> most

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:48.100 
something that does work the most

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:50.039 
something that does work the most
successful<00:01:48.429> people<00:01:48.639> i<00:01:48.850> know<00:01:48.909> have<00:01:49.299> no<00:01:49.600> fear<00:01:50.020> of

failure<00:01:50.499> and<00:01:50.649> instead<00:01:51.130> they<00:01:51.249> embrace<00:01:51.789> it

00:01:52.099 --> 00:01:52.109 
failure and instead they embrace it
