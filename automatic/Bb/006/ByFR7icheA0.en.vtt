that<00:01:22.680> I<00:01:22.770> got<00:01:22.920> used<00:01:23.189> to<00:01:23.280> them<00:01:23.369> rather<00:01:23.549> quickly

00:01:23.679 --> 00:01:23.689 
that I got used to them rather quickly

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:25.910 
that I got used to them rather quickly
so<00:01:24.689> you<00:01:24.780> guys<00:01:24.930> can<00:01:25.049> see<00:01:25.170> here<00:01:25.380> it<00:01:25.530> does<00:01:25.560> have<00:01:25.740> a

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
so you guys can see here it does have a

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.170 
so you guys can see here it does have a
lot<00:01:26.100> of<00:01:26.130> the<00:01:26.250> features<00:01:26.369> from<00:01:26.729> the<00:01:26.850> standard

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
lot of the features from the standard

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:28.310 
lot of the features from the standard
minecraft<00:01:27.600> so<00:01:27.720> if<00:01:27.780> for<00:01:27.869> example<00:01:27.900> there's

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
minecraft so if for example there's

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.190 
minecraft so if for example there's
lighting<00:01:28.829> so<00:01:29.009> if<00:01:29.100> I<00:01:29.220> go<00:01:29.820> ahead<00:01:29.909> and<00:01:30.079> go<00:01:31.079> ahead

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
lighting so if I go ahead and go ahead

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.990 
lighting so if I go ahead and go ahead
and<00:01:31.320> kill<00:01:31.500> that<00:01:31.650> off<00:01:31.829> and<00:01:32.100> you'll<00:01:32.610> see<00:01:32.820> it<00:01:32.909> will

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
and kill that off and you'll see it will

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.420 
and kill that off and you'll see it will
get<00:01:33.240> darker<00:01:33.630> here<00:01:34.020> but<00:01:34.799> there<00:01:35.100> are<00:01:35.130> some

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
get darker here but there are some

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.100 
get darker here but there are some
problems<00:01:35.610> for<00:01:36.000> one<00:01:36.150> it<00:01:36.420> runs<00:01:36.780> a<00:01:36.869> little<00:01:36.930> bit

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
problems for one it runs a little bit

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:38.240 
problems for one it runs a little bit
laggy<00:01:37.320> from<00:01:37.530> time<00:01:37.710> to<00:01:37.829> time<00:01:37.860> you<00:01:38.189> know

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
laggy from time to time you know

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:39.260 
laggy from time to time you know
actually<00:01:38.520> right<00:01:38.640> now<00:01:38.759> it's<00:01:38.790> running<00:01:39.180> pretty

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
actually right now it's running pretty

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:40.999 
actually right now it's running pretty
much<00:01:39.360> perfectly<00:01:39.780> however<00:01:40.229> everyone's<00:01:40.799> small

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
much perfectly however everyone's small

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:42.830 
much perfectly however everyone's small
just<00:01:41.250> like<00:01:41.310> on<00:01:41.579> the<00:01:41.790> standard<00:01:42.240> minecraft<00:01:42.659> it

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
just like on the standard minecraft it

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.120 
just like on the standard minecraft it
will<00:01:42.930> get<00:01:43.110> a<00:01:43.140> little<00:01:43.229> bit<00:01:43.380> laggy<00:01:43.619> as<00:01:43.860> it's<00:01:44.040> you

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
will get a little bit laggy as it's you

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.219 
will get a little bit laggy as it's you
know<00:01:44.159> redrawing<00:01:44.820> and<00:01:45.270> a<00:01:45.450> lot<00:01:45.780> kind<00:01:45.990> of<00:01:46.049> stuff

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
know redrawing and a lot kind of stuff

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.170 
know redrawing and a lot kind of stuff
and<00:01:46.439> on<00:01:46.500> top<00:01:46.710> of<00:01:46.740> that<00:01:46.950> the<00:01:47.310> controls<00:01:47.729> well<00:01:48.060> I

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
and on top of that the controls well I

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:49.249 
and on top of that the controls well I
do<00:01:48.240> think<00:01:48.570> that<00:01:48.720> they're<00:01:48.869> pretty<00:01:49.079> good

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
do think that they're pretty good

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.740 
do think that they're pretty good
they're<00:01:49.320> not<00:01:49.530> quite<00:01:50.159> perfect<00:01:50.880> it<00:01:51.299> definitely

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
they're not quite perfect it definitely

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.450 
they're not quite perfect it definitely
will<00:01:51.840> take<00:01:52.049> you<00:01:52.229> a<00:01:52.470> little<00:01:52.770> bit<00:01:52.920> to<00:01:53.100> get<00:01:53.220> used

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
will take you a little bit to get used

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:54.679 
will take you a little bit to get used
to<00:01:53.579> them<00:01:53.729> but<00:01:53.880> overall<00:01:54.149> I<00:01:54.270> think<00:01:54.390> it's<00:01:54.630> a

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
to them but overall I think it's a

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:56.690 
to them but overall I think it's a
pretty<00:01:54.899> solid<00:01:55.110> port<00:01:55.470> of<00:01:55.619> minecraft<00:01:56.189> the<00:01:56.460> next

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
pretty solid port of minecraft the next

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.609 
pretty solid port of minecraft the next
game<00:01:56.820> I<00:01:56.939> will<00:01:57.060> be<00:01:57.240> showing<00:01:57.420> you<00:01:57.600> is<00:01:57.719> asphalt<00:01:57.960> 6

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
game I will be showing you is asphalt 6

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.410 
game I will be showing you is asphalt 6
now<00:01:59.130> unlike<00:01:59.430> minecraft<00:01:59.880> which<00:02:00.000> I<00:02:00.119> believe<00:02:00.299> is

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
now unlike minecraft which I believe is

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.209 
now unlike minecraft which I believe is
seven<00:02:00.719> or<00:02:00.780> eight<00:02:00.869> dollars<00:02:01.259> this<00:02:01.740> section<00:02:02.070> does

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
seven or eight dollars this section does

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:03.560 
seven or eight dollars this section does
come<00:02:02.460> free<00:02:02.759> with<00:02:02.790> the<00:02:03.030> phone<00:02:03.240> and<00:02:03.479> it's

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
come free with the phone and it's

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.569 
come free with the phone and it's
actually<00:02:03.810> a<00:02:03.869> decent<00:02:04.170> racing<00:02:04.649> game<00:02:04.829> so<00:02:05.460> if<00:02:05.520> you

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
actually a decent racing game so if you

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:07.100 
actually a decent racing game so if you
guys<00:02:05.670> have<00:02:05.820> ever<00:02:05.880> played<00:02:06.090> on<00:02:06.390> other<00:02:06.570> platforms

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
guys have ever played on other platforms

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:08.809 
guys have ever played on other platforms
it<00:02:07.229> is<00:02:07.320> a<00:02:07.350> very<00:02:07.619> similar<00:02:07.829> game<00:02:07.950> but<00:02:08.640> it<00:02:08.700> does

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
it is a very similar game but it does

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:10.160 
it is a very similar game but it does
benefit<00:02:09.270> from<00:02:09.330> having<00:02:09.629> the<00:02:09.840> physical

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
benefit from having the physical

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.070 
benefit from having the physical

little<00:02:44.550> bit<00:02:44.640> choppy<00:02:44.790> from<00:02:45.090> time<00:02:45.240> to<00:02:45.360> time<00:02:45.390> but

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
little bit choppy from time to time but

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:48.250 
little bit choppy from time to time but
that's<00:02:46.620> not<00:02:46.920> too<00:02:47.010> bad<00:02:47.190> alright<00:02:47.490> let's<00:02:47.610> widen

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:48.260 
that's not too bad alright let's widen

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.870 
that's not too bad alright let's widen
now<00:02:49.260> this<00:02:49.410> is<00:02:49.560> a<00:02:49.590> very<00:02:49.740> arcade-style<00:02:50.280> racing

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:50.880 
now this is a very arcade-style racing

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:53.810 
now this is a very arcade-style racing
game<00:02:51.390> so<00:02:52.020> you<00:02:52.590> know<00:02:52.680> the<00:02:52.830> power-ups<00:02:53.340> so<00:02:53.610> if<00:02:53.700> I

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:53.820 
game so you know the power-ups so if I

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:56.150 
game so you know the power-ups so if I
use<00:02:54.480> the<00:02:54.660> nitrous<00:02:55.230> or<00:02:55.410> whatever<00:02:55.740> they<00:02:55.830> call<00:02:56.040> it

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
use the nitrous or whatever they call it

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.550 
use the nitrous or whatever they call it
here<00:02:56.400> and<00:02:57.300> you<00:02:57.450> also<00:02:57.660> pick<00:02:57.840> up<00:02:57.959> like<00:02:58.140> money<00:02:58.440> and

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
here and you also pick up like money and

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.170 
here and you also pick up like money and
some<00:02:58.950> different<00:02:59.190> power-ups<00:02:59.490> that<00:02:59.670> are<00:02:59.820> along

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
some different power-ups that are along

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:03.530 
some different power-ups that are along
the<00:03:00.450> road<00:03:01.440> so<00:03:01.560> it's<00:03:01.680> not<00:03:01.800> quite<00:03:02.160> a<00:03:02.370> real<00:03:03.000> racing

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
the road so it's not quite a real racing

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:04.910 
the road so it's not quite a real racing
game<00:03:03.720> which<00:03:03.840> is<00:03:03.930> with<00:03:04.050> my<00:03:04.170> favorite<00:03:04.500> material

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:04.920 
game which is with my favorite material

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:06.980 
game which is with my favorite material
so<00:03:05.100> here's<00:03:05.580> some<00:03:05.730> nitrous<00:03:06.060> power-ups<00:03:06.450> some

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:06.990 
so here's some nitrous power-ups some

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:08.090 
so here's some nitrous power-ups some
reason<00:03:07.200> the<00:03:07.260> frame<00:03:07.440> works<00:03:07.590> a<00:03:07.650> little<00:03:07.740> bit<00:03:07.950> low

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:08.100 
reason the frame works a little bit low

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:11.180 
reason the frame works a little bit low
right<00:03:08.340> now<00:03:08.370> but<00:03:08.820> not<00:03:09.330> a<00:03:09.360> big<00:03:09.540> deal<00:03:09.860> alright<00:03:10.860> so

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.190 
right now but not a big deal alright so

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:12.080 
right now but not a big deal alright so
actually<00:03:11.310> it's<00:03:11.550> kind<00:03:11.700> of<00:03:11.730> funny<00:03:11.910> usually

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
actually it's kind of funny usually

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:13.520 
actually it's kind of funny usually

always kind of liked I thought was
pretty<00:04:16.919> interesting<00:04:17.040> almost<00:04:17.970> like<00:04:18.090> a<00:04:18.120> 3d

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:18.630 
pretty interesting almost like a 3d

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:21.170 
pretty interesting almost like a 3d
version<00:04:18.930> of<00:04:19.200> Mario<00:04:20.100> almost<00:04:20.549> it's<00:04:20.760> not<00:04:20.880> really

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:21.180 
version of Mario almost it's not really

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:22.670 
version of Mario almost it's not really
but<00:04:21.330> that's<00:04:21.390> that's<00:04:21.750> again<00:04:22.169> it's<00:04:22.320> an<00:04:22.440> awful

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:22.680 
but that's that's again it's an awful

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:24.529 
but that's that's again it's an awful
way<00:04:22.770> of<00:04:22.860> explaining<00:04:23.310> it<00:04:23.520> but<00:04:23.729> uh<00:04:23.760> I<00:04:24.090> have<00:04:24.419> to

00:04:24.529 --> 00:04:24.539 
way of explaining it but uh I have to

00:04:24.539 --> 00:04:26.510 
way of explaining it but uh I have to
jump<00:04:24.840> and<00:04:25.080> avoid<00:04:25.320> dying<00:04:25.830> in

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:26.520 
jump and avoid dying in

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:31.129 
jump and avoid dying in
so<00:04:26.849> see<00:04:27.090> if<00:04:27.180> we<00:04:27.300> can<00:04:27.889> go<00:04:28.889> kill<00:04:29.280> this<00:04:29.520> one<00:04:30.210> fall

00:04:31.129 --> 00:04:31.139 
so see if we can go kill this one fall

00:04:31.139 --> 00:04:33.290 
so see if we can go kill this one fall
in<00:04:31.229> there<00:04:31.490> this<00:04:32.490> is<00:04:32.610> actually<00:04:32.819> probably<00:04:32.940> my

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:33.300 
in there this is actually probably my

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:34.610 
in there this is actually probably my
