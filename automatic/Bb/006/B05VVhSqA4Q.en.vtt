counterclockwise direction around that

00:00:48.760 --> 00:01:14.120 
counterclockwise direction around that
loop

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.700

starting point but going in the opposite
direction<00:03:34.440> better<00:03:35.440> close<00:03:35.740> that<00:03:36.010> bridge<00:03:36.520> huh

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:56.800 

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:02.720 

a<00:03:56.890> sticky<00:03:57.880> point

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:44.190 
and now it's on familiar territory I

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:46.200 
and now it's on familiar territory I
thought<00:04:45.190> that<00:04:45.370> was<00:04:45.490> pretty<00:04:45.640> cool

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:51.760 
seconds of novel track before returning

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:55.170 
seconds of novel track before returning
to<00:04:51.880> a<00:04:51.970> spit<00:04:52.270> spot<00:04:52.540> it<00:04:52.690> had<00:04:52.720> been<00:04:53.020> before
