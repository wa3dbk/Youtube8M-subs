00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:07.009
 let's go dream how will the athletes 

00:00:03.379 --> 00:00:09.860
 fight in this final italians and germans 

00:00:07.009 --> 00:00:15.880
 were in alfalfa for with the team new 

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:18.350
 Zealand at 2 3 positions deuce steam room 

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:21.040
 me as a couples nickname their past 

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:27.550
 attitude to this kind of luxurious 

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:27.550
 besides the greatest traditions in this kind 

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:31.360
 laid by the greats 

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:36.920
 Stukalov and golden eagle point of view 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:39.110
 number of victories 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:42.520
 European Championship wins then they 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:42.520
 very open character 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:48.720
 Turin Dubrovsky maschinen Wait 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:53.100
 maschinen korshikov our ingenious 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:55.290
 Koptsev Popov's success is the last 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:01:00.030
 women's medal won in Moscow too 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:01:03.840
 curling doubles but now look how 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:06.060
 this six is ​​breaking 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:11.280
 apart because we have 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:13.350
 leader leader very serious well and already 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.930
 look that the team is new 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:19.820
 Zealand is inferior to the Norwegians 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:23.369
 in front of the body over well what is it 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:28.619
 not all kapkov and his paddle and ketila 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:32.160
 borscht is a very impressive beginning after 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:34.229
 first pyatisotki will be enough to endure and to 

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:36.270
 finish we will look there for far water 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:38.250
 also the Argentina national team is very 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.869
 strongly geographically finite tassic 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.930
 whenever I say this when mushroom 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:44.460
 reporting to mind 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:48.229
 but let's not call weather conditions 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.229
 very heavy today 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:56.640
 this is the german national team roll in the shadows but 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:58.740
 still understandably lead the fight on 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:03.390
 distant approaches to the finish for medals 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:06.840
 the Germans though as long as we see them thousands 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:08.850
 only five meters fit not very 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:11.450
 It turns out Italians rowed on yew 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:11.450
 foxy 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:29.819
 slicing team grew grew fight 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:29.819
 for the highest places 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:45.220
 solid advantage but we see that in 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:49.180
 general controls the situation and 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:51.340
 from the far water sua times rosso argentina 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:56.400
 and side by side 7 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:03:00.840
 but still lagging behind the Vikings 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:00.840
 World Cup winner Russia Manson 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:16.440
 very serious start considering that 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:18.540
 on international guys by and large 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:21.380
 the score is not very big this season iblis 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:21.380
 catching Norwegians 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:47.110
 but for now we see it trimmed 

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:49.510
 athletes who are fighting for 

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:54.810
 silver and bronze medals for this 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:54.810
 moment is all the benefits of the Norwegians 

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:03.430
 start getting tired a little bit like me 

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:03.430
 it seemed to take off 

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:09.000
 now going on the soul of all the guys 

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:12.900
 without exception in this finale to present 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:14.819
 easy as always brilliant wrote 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:17.730
 books are the best half of shit life 

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:19.650
 balling itself brilliant rower how often 

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:21.600
 vac during such moments even on 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:24.780
 world championships and even more 

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:27.660
 olympic guys athletes dying 

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:29.970
 just to the finish line promised to throw damn 

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:32.460
 mothers this work is ungrateful often 

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:35.310
 not such a high-paying cash 

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:39.090
 then something pulls into the boat again 

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:41.090
 feeling to see 500 meters to the finish 

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:44.400
 and now 

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:47.639
 Lithuanians inflated the pace and over 40 fungus 

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:50.520
 per minute they do but new zealand 

00:04:47.639 --> 00:04:51.180
 the team looks extremely weak on this 

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:55.680
 finish 

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:57.630
 then the finish garden meters begins very 

00:04:55.680 --> 00:05:01.639
 powerful work and see how by 

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:01.639
 Lithuanians clean the pace 

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:10.760
 Saul sweaters and Roland Smolensk with 

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:13.860
 your luck is my type Italians 

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:15.840
 because it would seem that losing a lot 

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:18.810
 new neighbor unexpected for many 

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:24.750
 got to cheer here how to change is dead 

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:26.580
 and 5 water and almost 6 exhausted guys 

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:28.680
 and after all there is a New Zealand team in 

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:30.990
 this season looked brilliant 

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:33.240
 just watch what they are doing but the body 

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:36.120
 still giving way to the Lithuanians Norwegian for 

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:38.490
 due to the density of the fungus is very powerful 

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:41.760
 work but little by little here 

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:44.310
 Lithuanians are taking this advantage 

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:47.880
 distance may not be enough twist finish 

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:50.130
 how can the germans the germans go spot on 

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:52.560
 fourth-fifth but we see that the national team 

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:55.110
 battisti team 

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:58.770

00:05:55.110 --> 00:06:03.600
 francesco pasi dreams of medals Lithuanians 

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:07.050
 twist the finish and now bite into these 

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:09.300
 the last meters Lithuanians yet understanding 

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:12.420
 that they are the second Italians the third 

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:15.870
 Germans 4 winners are the Norwegians 

00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:18.180
 please, but de lancy are obvious losers 

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:21.840

 great successes the floor of a chaff and 

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:26.700
 Friedrich Bakin and champions 

00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:29.040
 Olympic but what is phenomenal 

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:32.040
 completely one more Olympic view yet 

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:34.220
 some heroes from norway world champions 

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:37.020
 fantastic result 

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:41.960
 Lithuanians are great fellows are very pleased with their 

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:41.960
 second position congratulations guys 

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:52.600
 world champion zagrebnom 23 older 28 

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:54.540
 but this is the Grecian dawn often 

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:57.730
 which is after 30 

00:06:54.540 --> 00:07:03.730
 arises as to 

00:06:57.730 --> 00:07:05.470
 Lithuanians for mushroom zagrebnom 2521 

00:07:03.730 --> 00:07:07.690
 just exactly the sum of Achinsk with 

00:07:05.470 --> 00:07:12.850
 yesterday's junior is lovely perfect 

00:07:07.690 --> 00:07:18.490
 race before the world rowing championship 

00:07:12.850 --> 00:07:19.240
 academic this event we once again we 

00:07:18.490 --> 00:07:22.540

00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:27.660
 about the popularity of rowing even that legend 

00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:31.740
 It should probably be no need 

00:07:27.660 --> 00:07:31.740
 describe the obvious 

00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:40.430
 largest european american 

00:07:37.129 --> 00:07:42.639
 Universities unusually 

00:07:40.430 --> 00:07:46.250
 popular

 developed and spectacular sport oh 

00:07:46.250 --> 00:07:54.710
 Norwegians and I'm afraid that it is a long plant 

00:07:48.830 --> 00:07:57.469
 The first issue can not be for a long time than Kapkov 

00:07:54.710 --> 00:07:59.990
 can eat it for a mushroom but he understood this 

00:07:57.469 --> 00:08:01.580
 the situation and the whole moment for you 

00:07:59.990 --> 00:08:04.879
