00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:47.819 
just wasn't cute at all so a lot of you
guys<00:00:46.510> are<00:00:46.660> asking<00:00:46.809> them<00:00:47.200> I<00:00:47.380> know<00:00:47.440> to<00:00:47.559> change

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:51.630 
your hair color when it's due to do that
so<00:00:50.020> I<00:00:50.050> thought<00:00:50.470> I'd<00:00:50.530> just<00:00:50.649> do<00:00:51.280> a<00:00:51.309> video<00:00:51.460> about

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:53.520 
so I thought I'd just do a video about
it<00:00:51.760> so<00:00:52.090> if<00:00:52.149> you<00:00:52.239> remember<00:00:52.480> back<00:00:52.600> in<00:00:52.660> the<00:00:53.290> last

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:53.530 
it so if you remember back in the last

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:55.319

00:00:57.630 --> 00:00:57.640 
color highlights in magenta with the

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:00.389 
color highlights in magenta with the
volume<00:00:58.210> 30<00:00:58.480> developer<00:00:58.989> turns<00:00:59.980> out<00:01:00.100> the<00:01:00.219> 30

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:01.680 
volume 30 developer turns out the 30
developer<00:01:00.760> was<00:01:00.879> just<00:01:01.030> way<00:01:01.090> too<00:01:01.120> strong<00:01:01.390> for<00:01:01.600> my

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:01.690 
developer was just way too strong for my

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:02.910 
developer was just way too strong for my
hair<00:01:01.899> especially<00:01:02.379> considering<00:01:02.800> I'm

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:02.920 
hair especially considering I'm

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:04.639

naturally<00:01:03.100> blonde

00:01:04.639 --> 00:01:04.649 
naturally blonde

00:01:04.649 --> 00:01:07.020 
naturally blonde
it<00:01:05.649> was<00:01:05.740> just<00:01:05.890> looking<00:01:06.189> too<00:01:06.429> much<00:01:06.579> off<00:01:06.759> of<00:01:06.880> my

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:07.030 
it was just looking too much off of my

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:09.510 
it was just looking too much off of my
hair<00:01:07.240> so<00:01:07.420> that's<00:01:07.569> why<00:01:07.840> is<00:01:08.259> not<00:01:08.979> really<00:01:09.189> damaged

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:09.520 
hair so that's why is not really damaged

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:11.249 
hair so that's why is not really damaged
and<00:01:09.639> whatnot<00:01:09.880> so<00:01:10.149> I<00:01:10.359> wanted<00:01:10.840> to<00:01:10.899> figure<00:01:11.020> out

00:01:11.249 --> 00:01:11.259 
and whatnot so I wanted to figure out

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:13.260 
and whatnot so I wanted to figure out
how<00:01:11.380> to<00:01:11.439> color<00:01:11.679> my<00:01:11.859> hair<00:01:11.889> with<00:01:12.280> something<00:01:12.670> that

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:13.270 
how to color my hair with something that

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:15.629 
how to color my hair with something that
was<00:01:13.389> still<00:01:13.569> red<00:01:13.869> but<00:01:14.200> we<00:01:14.530> hold<00:01:14.859> my<00:01:15.100> color<00:01:15.340> so<00:01:15.579> I

00:01:15.629 --> 00:01:15.639 
was still red but we hold my color so I

00:01:15.639 --> 00:01:17.039 
was still red but we hold my color so I
went<00:01:15.789> to<00:01:15.819> Sally's<00:01:16.270> and<00:01:16.420> I<00:01:16.450> spoke<00:01:16.689> to<00:01:16.749> somebody

00:01:17.039 --> 00:01:17.049 
went to Sally's and I spoke to somebody

00:01:17.049 --> 00:01:18.959 
went to Sally's and I spoke to somebody
about<00:01:17.380> it<00:01:17.439> and<00:01:17.740> she<00:01:18.159> recommended<00:01:18.429> this<00:01:18.789> which

00:01:18.959 --> 00:01:18.969 
about it and she recommended this which

00:01:18.969 --> 00:01:21.059 
about it and she recommended this which
is<00:01:19.149> the<00:01:19.569> same<00:01:19.779> brand<00:01:19.959> the<00:01:20.259> L'Oreal<00:01:20.590> excellence

00:01:21.059 --> 00:01:21.069

is the same brand the L'Oreal excellence
hi<00:01:21.219> color<00:01:21.490> but<00:01:21.729> instead<00:01:22.029> of<00:01:22.709> highlights<00:01:23.709> it's

00:01:23.969 --> 00:01:23.979 
hi color but instead of highlights it's

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:25.590 
hi color but instead of highlights it's
just<00:01:24.189> hi<00:01:24.310> color<00:01:24.609> so<00:01:24.819> this<00:01:24.939> was<00:01:25.090> meant<00:01:25.270> for<00:01:25.420> more

sort of breath she was recommending me

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:51.059 
sort of breath she was recommending me
to<00:01:49.179> get<00:01:49.419> the<00:01:49.599> volume<00:01:49.869> 20<00:01:50.380> developer<00:01:50.770> since<00:01:50.919> my

00:01:51.059 --> 00:01:51.069 
to get the volume 20 developer since my

00:01:51.069 --> 00:01:53.010 
to get the volume 20 developer since my
hair<00:01:51.369> was<00:01:52.090> light<00:01:52.329> enough<00:01:52.359> that<00:01:52.719> didn't<00:01:52.899> need

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:53.020 
hair was light enough that didn't need

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:56.010 
hair was light enough that didn't need
to<00:01:53.049> get<00:01:53.229> a<00:01:53.259> 30<00:01:53.529> so<00:01:54.340> I<00:01:54.369> did<00:01:54.579> that<00:01:54.759> and<00:01:55.020> that's

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:56.020 
to get a 30 so I did that and that's

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:58.319 
to get a 30 so I did that and that's
pretty<00:01:56.289> much<00:01:56.409> it<00:01:56.649> so<00:01:56.859> I<00:01:57.429> actually<00:01:57.549> got<00:01:58.119> two

00:01:58.319 --> 00:01:58.329 
pretty much it so I actually got two

00:01:58.329 --> 00:02:01.080 
pretty much it so I actually got two
boxes<00:01:58.630> of<00:01:58.749> this<00:01:58.869> and<00:01:59.139> mix<00:01:59.229> it<00:01:59.409> with<00:01:59.499> the<00:02:00.090> volume

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:01.090 
boxes of this and mix it with the volume

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:02.609 
boxes of this and mix it with the volume
20<00:02:01.299> developer<00:02:01.749> and<00:02:01.929> that's<00:02:02.079> how<00:02:02.229> I<00:02:02.259> got<00:02:02.439> this

00:02:02.609 --> 00:02:02.619 
20 developer and that's how I got this

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:05.879 
20 developer and that's how I got this
result<00:02:03.039> so<00:02:04.079> that's<00:02:05.079> pretty<00:02:05.259> much<00:02:05.349> it<00:02:05.709> so<00:02:05.739> I

00:02:05.879 --> 00:02:05.889 
result so that's pretty much it so I

00:02:05.889 --> 00:02:08.669 
result so that's pretty much it so I
guess<00:02:06.569> the<00:02:07.569> hi<00:02:07.749> color<00:02:08.050> is<00:02:08.229> just<00:02:08.380> a<00:02:08.440> lot<00:02:08.560> better

00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:08.679 
guess the hi color is just a lot better

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:12.270 
guess the hi color is just a lot better
for<00:02:09.069> me<00:02:09.220> than<00:02:09.369> the<00:02:09.489> highlights<00:02:09.880> and<00:02:11.280> the

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:12.280 
for me than the highlights and the

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:13.800 
for me than the highlights and the
volume<00:02:12.610> 20<00:02:12.880> developers<00:02:13.270> a<00:02:13.300> lot<00:02:13.480> better<00:02:13.630> than

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
volume 20 developers a lot better than

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:14.210 
volume 20 developers a lot better than
the<00:02:13.870> 30

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 
the 30

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:15.980 
the 30
I<00:02:14.250> don't<00:02:14.490> need<00:02:14.580> it<00:02:14.760> so<00:02:14.940> that's<00:02:15.660> pretty<00:02:15.750> much

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:15.990 
I don't need it so that's pretty much

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:18.140
