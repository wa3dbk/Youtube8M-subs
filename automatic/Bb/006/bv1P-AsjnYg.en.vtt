00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.180 
starting from the back you got the Nike
Air<00:00:59.969> tab<00:01:00.270> right<00:01:00.539> there<00:01:00.809> and<00:01:01.350> it's<00:01:01.890> actually

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
Air tab right there and it's actually

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.189

nice<00:01:06.570> contrast<00:01:07.140> and<00:01:07.380> then<00:01:07.920> as<00:01:08.100> you<00:01:08.189> guys<00:01:08.310> can
