looking at half three to finish off the

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:11.060 
looking at half three to finish off the
set<00:00:07.620> so<00:00:08.580> once<00:00:09.150> again<00:00:09.389> I<00:00:09.840> am<00:00:10.170> going<00:00:10.469> to<00:00:10.650> skip

set so once again I am going to skip
ahead<00:00:11.190> until<00:00:11.940> the<00:00:12.360> path<00:00:12.570> actually<00:00:13.230> starts<00:00:13.559> to

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
ahead until the path actually starts to

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:15.410 
ahead until the path actually starts to
change<00:00:13.920> so<00:00:14.340> we're<00:00:14.490> covering<00:00:14.790> path<00:00:15.059> three

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
change so we're covering path three

or<00:01:39.409> set<00:01:39.590> of<00:01:39.679> two<00:01:40.189> locations<00:01:40.850> which<00:01:41.750> are

00:01:41.919 --> 00:01:41.929 
or set of two locations which are

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:46.230 
or set of two locations which are
gathering<00:01:42.409> some<00:01:42.710> form<00:01:43.039> of<00:01:43.479> fancy<00:01:45.130> ectoplasmic

gathering some form of fancy ectoplasmic

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:51.490 
gathering some form of fancy ectoplasmic
power<00:01:48.340> but<00:01:49.340> you<00:01:49.429> got<00:01:49.579> a<00:01:49.610> defendant<00:01:50.090> so<00:01:50.500> you'll

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:51.500 
power but you got a defendant so you'll

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:53.440 
power but you got a defendant so you'll
have<00:01:51.649> Borough<00:01:52.069> spawning<00:01:52.580> and<00:01:52.880> from<00:01:53.330> these

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:53.450 
have Borough spawning and from these

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:55.300 
have Borough spawning and from these
burrows<00:01:53.690> obviously<00:01:54.500> grave<00:01:54.740> wings<00:01:54.979> will<00:01:55.100> spawn

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:55.310 
burrows obviously grave wings will spawn

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:58.389 
burrows obviously grave wings will spawn

nuclear burrow next I'll kill that last
one<00:03:10.440> and<00:03:10.739> this<00:03:11.220> is<00:03:11.400> that<00:03:11.550> pattern

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.010 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:20.130 

remember<00:03:18.760> to<00:03:18.849> pick<00:03:18.940> up<00:03:19.030> your<00:03:19.090> chests<00:03:19.599> after

remember to pick up your chests after

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:25.570 
remember to pick up your chests after

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:25.580 

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:28.030 

so<00:03:26.210> we're<00:03:26.450> heading<00:03:26.690> down<00:03:26.870> into<00:03:27.410> the<00:03:27.710> grave

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:28.040 
so we're heading down into the grave

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:31.030 
so we're heading down into the grave
linked<00:03:28.310> and<00:03:28.430> also<00:03:28.670> once<00:03:28.940> again<00:03:29.830> skipping<00:03:30.830> all

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:31.040 
linked and also once again skipping all

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:32.740 
linked and also once again skipping all
this<00:03:31.160> trash<00:03:31.400> and<00:03:31.700> heading<00:03:32.090> straight<00:03:32.270> to<00:03:32.660> the

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:32.750 
this trash and heading straight to the

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:35.920 
this trash and heading straight to the
last<00:03:32.930> boss<00:03:33.730> path<00:03:34.730> 3<00:03:34.970> is<00:03:35.180> probably<00:03:35.390> the

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:35.930 
last boss path 3 is probably the

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:38.260 
last boss path 3 is probably the
shortest<00:03:36.590> path<00:03:36.980> if<00:03:37.340> you've<00:03:37.760> got<00:03:38.000> enough

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:38.270 
shortest path if you've got enough

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:39.870 
shortest path if you've got enough
damage<00:03:38.600> to<00:03:38.630> take<00:03:38.900> down<00:03:39.050> the<00:03:39.140> burros<00:03:39.410> quicker

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:39.880 
damage to take down the burros quicker

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:42.790 
damage to take down the burros quicker
the<00:03:40.880> trade-off<00:03:41.270> for<00:03:41.300> this<00:03:41.570> is<00:03:41.930> that<00:03:42.230> the<00:03:42.560> last

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:42.800 
the trade-off for this is that the last

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:46.260 
the trade-off for this is that the last
boss<00:03:43.040> actually<00:03:43.310> has<00:03:43.790> a<00:03:44.150> little<00:03:44.780> more<00:03:44.900> to<00:03:45.140> him

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:46.270 
boss actually has a little more to him

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:51.610 
boss actually has a little more to him
kind<00:03:47.270> of<00:03:47.680> so<00:03:48.820> you've<00:03:49.820> got<00:03:50.060> two<00:03:50.930> main<00:03:51.140> abilities

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:51.620 
kind of so you've got two main abilities

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:57.040 
kind of so you've got two main abilities
one<00:03:52.550> is<00:03:52.820> his<00:03:53.750> AoE<00:03:55.480> it's<00:03:56.480> kind<00:03:56.750> of<00:03:56.780> like<00:03:56.930> the

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:57.050 
one is his AoE it's kind of like the

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:59.620 
one is his AoE it's kind of like the
sonic<00:03:57.410> wave<00:03:57.680> attacks<00:03:58.100> so<00:03:58.640> if<00:03:59.120> that<00:03:59.270> hits<00:03:59.480> you

00:03:59.620 --> 00:03:59.630 
sonic wave attacks so if that hits you

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:01.990 
sonic wave attacks so if that hits you
that's<00:03:59.810> going<00:03:59.930> to<00:04:00.050> knock<00:04:00.200> you<00:04:00.320> down<00:04:01.000> that's

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:02.000 
that's going to knock you down that's

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.670 
that's going to knock you down that's
kind<00:04:02.180> of<00:04:02.240> dangerous<00:04:02.360> because<00:04:02.930> of<00:04:03.050> his<00:04:03.170> next

kind of dangerous because of his next

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:06.520 
kind of dangerous because of his next
ability<00:04:03.860> he<00:04:04.550> has<00:04:04.730> the<00:04:05.060> creates<00:04:05.840> a<00:04:05.990> seismic

you gonna kinda probably get hit by a

note<00:04:42.970> that<00:04:43.000> a<00:04:43.570> lot<00:04:44.350> of<00:04:44.380> the<00:04:44.590> area<00:04:45.010> is<00:04:45.250> covered

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:45.550 
note that a lot of the area is covered

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:48.450 
note that a lot of the area is covered
by<00:04:46.420> this<00:04:46.750> seismic<00:04:46.990> attack<00:04:47.500> it<00:04:48.010> seems<00:04:48.220> to<00:04:48.340> be

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:48.460 
by this seismic attack it seems to be

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:50.670 
by this seismic attack it seems to be
one<00:04:48.730> area<00:04:49.120> and<00:04:49.360> lightest<00:04:49.750> this<00:04:49.990> area<00:04:50.350> just

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:50.680 
one area and lightest this area just

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:53.700 
one area and lightest this area just
here<00:04:51.040> between<00:04:52.000> the<00:04:52.120> two<00:04:52.300> columns<00:04:52.690> on<00:04:52.990> this

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:53.710 
here between the two columns on this

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:57.330 
here between the two columns on this
little<00:04:53.950> rise<00:04:55.470> it<00:04:56.470> seems<00:04:56.770> to<00:04:56.890> be<00:04:57.010> that<00:04:57.250> the

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:57.340 
little rise it seems to be that the

00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:59.580 
little rise it seems to be that the
ceiling<00:04:57.700> doesn't<00:04:58.030> fall<00:04:58.420> here<00:04:58.720> so<00:04:59.260> this<00:04:59.380> is

00:04:59.580 --> 00:04:59.590 
ceiling doesn't fall here so this is

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:03.720 
ceiling doesn't fall here so this is
kind<00:04:59.890> of<00:05:00.010> the<00:05:00.190> safe<00:05:00.430> zone<00:05:01.920> the<00:05:02.920> wall<00:05:03.130> master<00:05:03.550> in

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:03.730 
kind of the safe zone the wall master in

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:05.640 
kind of the safe zone the wall master in
this<00:05:03.880> fight<00:05:04.090> will<00:05:04.390> actually<00:05:04.750> put<00:05:04.930> up<00:05:05.080> a<00:05:05.350> shield

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:05.650 
this fight will actually put up a shield

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:08.940 
this fight will actually put up a shield
bubble<00:05:06.550> similar<00:05:07.210> to<00:05:07.330> one's<00:05:07.570> guardians<00:05:08.440> can

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:08.950 
bubble similar to one's guardians can

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:11.370 
bubble similar to one's guardians can
use<00:05:09.190> now<00:05:09.820> this<00:05:10.360> will<00:05:10.630> protect<00:05:10.810> you<00:05:11.170> from<00:05:11.290> the

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:13.750 
falling rocks but it's incredibly

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:15.870 
falling rocks but it's incredibly
unreliable<00:05:14.050> if<00:05:15.010> the<00:05:15.280> wall<00:05:15.430> master<00:05:15.730> gets

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:15.880 
unreliable if the wall master gets

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:18.000 
unreliable if the wall master gets
knocked<00:05:16.090> back<00:05:16.210> he<00:05:16.870> starts<00:05:17.200> casting<00:05:17.590> out<00:05:17.800> of

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:18.010 
knocked back he starts casting out of

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:20.970 
knocked back he starts casting out of
sync<00:05:18.250> so<00:05:18.490> you<00:05:18.730> end<00:05:18.880> up<00:05:19.290> the<00:05:20.290> ceiling<00:05:20.680> starts

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:20.980

falling<00:05:21.430> a<00:05:21.730> few<00:05:22.360> rocks<00:05:22.570> will<00:05:22.810> come<00:05:22.990> down<00:05:23.760> half

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:24.760 
falling a few rocks will come down half

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:27.780 
falling a few rocks will come down half
the<00:05:24.790> duration<00:05:25.690> of<00:05:25.750> it'll<00:05:25.960> go<00:05:26.230> and<00:05:26.500> then<00:05:27.190> he'll

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:27.790 
the duration of it'll go and then he'll

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:29.370 
the duration of it'll go and then he'll
put<00:05:27.940> the<00:05:27.970> bubble<00:05:28.270> up<00:05:28.390> and<00:05:28.540> the<00:05:28.870> bubble<00:05:29.110> will<00:05:29.230> be

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:29.380 
put the bubble up and the bubble will be

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:32.550 
put the bubble up and the bubble will be
there<00:05:29.590> for<00:05:30.090> so<00:05:31.090> long<00:05:31.270> after<00:05:31.510> the<00:05:32.080> attack<00:05:32.350> has

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:32.560 
there for so long after the attack has

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:33.810 
there for so long after the attack has
finished<00:05:32.770> so<00:05:33.340> you're<00:05:33.580> not<00:05:33.640> actually

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:33.820 
finished so you're not actually

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:36.120 
finished so you're not actually
protected<00:05:34.570> for<00:05:34.720> the<00:05:34.750> entire<00:05:35.020> duration<00:05:35.170> but
