or tear canals that are too tight which

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:24.640 
or tear canals that are too tight which
means<00:03:22.849> that<00:03:23.060> my<00:03:23.180> eyes<00:03:23.419> run<00:03:24.079> really<00:03:24.620> really

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:24.650 
means that my eyes run really really

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:26.379 
means that my eyes run really really
easily<00:03:25.010> like<00:03:25.310> every<00:03:25.519> time<00:03:25.669> I<00:03:25.790> lie<00:03:25.970> down<00:03:26.000> on<00:03:26.359> the

00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:26.389 
easily like every time I lie down on the

00:03:26.389 --> 00:03:28.240 
easily like every time I lie down on the
side<00:03:26.690> they<00:03:26.989> start<00:03:27.230> running<00:03:27.590> if<00:03:27.769> it's<00:03:27.919> too<00:03:28.040> cold

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:28.250 
side they start running if it's too cold

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:30.460 
side they start running if it's too cold
if<00:03:28.400> it's<00:03:28.549> windy<00:03:28.760> my<00:03:29.269> eyes<00:03:29.389> run<00:03:29.870> all<00:03:30.139> the<00:03:30.290> time

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:32.389 
so for me it's really important to

00:03:32.389 --> 00:03:35.530 
so for me it's really important to
actually<00:03:33.349> find<00:03:33.620> a<00:03:33.739> waterproof<00:03:34.280> products<00:03:34.849> they
