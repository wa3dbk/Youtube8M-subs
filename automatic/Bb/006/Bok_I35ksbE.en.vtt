through it now and I can you can see a

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:28.500 
through it now and I can you can see a
little<00:02:25.870> bit<00:02:26.050> of<00:02:26.170> daylight<00:02:26.350> there<00:02:27.330> and<00:02:28.330> that's

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:28.510 
little bit of daylight there and that's

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:32.040 
little bit of daylight there and that's
that's<00:02:28.870> hitting<00:02:29.230> it<00:02:29.320> with<00:02:30.130> a<00:02:30.630> knife<00:02:31.630> point

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:32.050 
that's hitting it with a knife point

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:35.250 
that's hitting it with a knife point
stabbing<00:02:32.890> and<00:02:33.760> with<00:02:34.210> a<00:02:34.240> solid<00:02:34.750> behind<00:02:34.930> it

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:35.260 
stabbing and with a solid behind it

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:38.090 
stabbing and with a solid behind it
though<00:02:35.410> that<00:02:36.220> makes<00:02:37.000> the<00:02:37.120> point<00:02:37.330> of<00:02:37.450> impact

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:38.100 
though that makes the point of impact

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:40.260 
though that makes the point of impact
greatly<00:02:39.100> increased<00:02:39.580> compared<00:02:40.000> to<00:02:40.090> what<00:02:40.240> a

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:40.270 
greatly increased compared to what a

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:43.830 
greatly increased compared to what a
snakes<00:02:40.600> gonna<00:02:40.780> do<00:02:41.940> when<00:02:42.940> a<00:02:42.970> snake<00:02:43.300> bites<00:02:43.600> you

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
snakes gonna do when a snake bites you

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:45.840 
snakes gonna do when a snake bites you
with<00:02:44.440> these<00:02:44.680> it's<00:02:45.040> not<00:02:45.190> gonna<00:02:45.310> have<00:02:45.520> something

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:45.850 
with these it's not gonna have something

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:47.790 
with these it's not gonna have something
solid<00:02:46.000> behind<00:02:46.480> it<00:02:46.660> let<00:02:47.140> me<00:02:47.170> give<00:02:47.380> a<00:02:47.410> little<00:02:47.620> bit

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:47.800 
solid behind it let me give a little bit

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:50.310 
solid behind it let me give a little bit
like<00:02:47.980> that<00:02:48.190> that's<00:02:49.150> gonna<00:02:49.360> take<00:02:49.630> the<00:02:49.840> point<00:02:50.230> of

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:50.320 
like that that's gonna take the point of

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:52.580 
like that that's gonna take the point of
impact<00:02:50.650> that's<00:02:51.310> going<00:02:51.460> to<00:02:51.670> decrease<00:02:51.820> it

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
impact that's going to decrease it

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:53.850 
impact that's going to decrease it
tremendously

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:53.860 
tremendously

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:56.310 
tremendously
compared<00:02:54.550> to<00:02:54.640> hitting<00:02:55.450> it<00:02:55.540> flush<00:02:55.900> against<00:02:56.260> the

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:56.320 
compared to hitting it flush against the

00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:00.120 
compared to hitting it flush against the
table<00:02:56.560> BAM<00:02:57.070> it's<00:02:57.670> gonna<00:02:57.850> stop<00:02:58.270> it<00:02:58.510> dead<00:02:59.130> right

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:00.130 
table BAM it's gonna stop it dead right

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:02.490 
table BAM it's gonna stop it dead right
there<00:03:00.430> that's<00:03:00.850> why<00:03:01.120> I<00:03:01.450> believe<00:03:01.870> the<00:03:02.260> knife

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:02.500 
there that's why I believe the knife

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:04.530 
there that's why I believe the knife
went<00:03:03.040> right<00:03:03.160> through<00:03:03.310> it<00:03:03.550> plus<00:03:03.880> a<00:03:03.910> knife<00:03:04.150> a

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:04.540 
went right through it plus a knife a

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:05.880 
went right through it plus a knife a
little<00:03:04.870> bit<00:03:04.990> stronger<00:03:05.260> than<00:03:05.410> the<00:03:05.530> snake's

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:05.890 
little bit stronger than the snake's

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:11.150 
little bit stronger than the snake's
Fang<00:03:06.190> I<00:03:06.370> would<00:03:06.550> say<00:03:07.560> but<00:03:09.480> anyways<00:03:10.480> these<00:03:10.780> uh
