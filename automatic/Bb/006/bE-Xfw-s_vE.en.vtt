00:02:45.699 --> 00:02:45.709 
be guessing but our usual spots are

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:49.190 
be guessing but our usual spots are
kamloops<00:02:46.070> in<00:02:46.220> penticton<00:02:46.730> yeah

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200

and they have single engine and then the

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:56.150

california and that's once those trees

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.490 
california and that's once those trees
die<00:03:47.489> they<00:03:47.790> become<00:03:47.849> pretty<00:03:48.540> volatile<00:03:48.959> feel<00:03:49.260> not

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:49.500 
die they become pretty volatile feel not

00:03:49.500 --> 00:04:39.590 
die they become pretty volatile feel not
that<00:03:49.680> they<00:03:49.769> are<00:03:49.890> into<00:03:50.099> anyways<00:03:50.400> so<00:03:51.590> thank<00:03:52.590> you
