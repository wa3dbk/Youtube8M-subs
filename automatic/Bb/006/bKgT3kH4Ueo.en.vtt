however<00:01:38.430> I<00:01:38.700> added<00:01:39.360> a<00:01:39.540> little<00:01:39.689> bit<00:01:39.810> of

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
however I added a little bit of

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.859 
however I added a little bit of
saturation<00:01:40.619> in<00:01:40.770> I<00:01:40.950> moved<00:01:41.490> about<00:01:41.820> a<00:01:42.119> couple<00:01:42.780> of

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
saturation in I moved about a couple of

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.840 
saturation in I moved about a couple of
MIL<00:01:43.020> to<00:01:43.200> the<00:01:43.290> right<00:01:43.470> see<00:01:44.399> if<00:01:44.460> I<00:01:44.520> make<00:01:44.700> any

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
MIL to the right see if I make any

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.440 
MIL to the right see if I make any
difference<00:01:45.180> from<00:01:45.540> 0<00:01:46.079> to<00:01:46.409> 4<00:01:47.299> everything<00:01:48.299> else

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
difference from 0 to 4 everything else

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:53.420 
difference from 0 to 4 everything else
is<00:01:48.570> remain<00:01:48.869> the<00:01:48.960> same<00:01:51.680> so<00:01:52.680> that's<00:01:53.189> the

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
is remain the same so that's the

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.940 
is remain the same so that's the
software<00:01:54.210> self<00:01:54.570> it's<00:01:55.229> pretty<00:01:55.530> easy<00:01:55.649> to<00:01:55.920> use

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950
