fight sokoto losses ready on 160 doesn't
stop<00:01:47.250> there<00:01:47.520> or<00:01:47.909> it's<00:01:48.119> back<00:01:48.330> down<00:01:48.360> to<00:01:48.539> 150<00:01:49.080> for

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
stop there or it's back down to 150 for

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.520 
stop there or it's back down to 150 for
free<00:01:49.409> it's<00:01:49.619> still<00:01:49.799> wake<00:01:49.950> up<00:01:50.100> you<00:01:51.030> know<00:01:51.149> so<00:01:51.420> I

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:51.530 
free it's still wake up you know so I

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:56.420 
free it's still wake up you know so I
think<00:01:52.530> I<00:01:52.860> think

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.220 

I<00:01:56.490> think<00:01:57.060> I<00:01:57.270> think<00:01:57.720> he's<00:01:57.840> made<00:01:57.990> a<00:01:58.020> few

00:01:58.220 --> 00:01:58.230 
I think I think he's made a few

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:00.620 
I think I think he's made a few
adjustments<00:01:58.520> we're<00:01:59.520> just<00:01:59.610> diet<00:01:59.940> with<00:02:00.510> his

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
adjustments we're just diet with his

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.050 
adjustments we're just diet with his
strength<00:02:00.990> and<00:02:01.710> conditioning<00:02:02.340> coach<00:02:02.610> is<00:02:02.940> all

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
strength and conditioning coach is all

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.690 
strength and conditioning coach is all
that<00:02:03.240> sauce<00:02:03.510> I<00:02:03.780> think<00:02:04.410> they're<00:02:04.860> 150<00:02:05.100> more<00:02:05.430> for

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
that sauce I think they're 150 more for

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.200 
that sauce I think they're 150 more for
now<00:02:05.820> now<00:02:06.980> eventually<00:02:07.980> and<00:02:08.520> maybe<00:02:08.910> a<00:02:09.030> couple

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:09.210 
now now eventually and maybe a couple

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:11.540 
now now eventually and maybe a couple
years<00:02:09.500> but<00:02:10.500> he's<00:02:10.649> still<00:02:10.860> young<00:02:11.100> is<00:02:11.310> still

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
growing but I see him at 154 maybe I

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:24.050
