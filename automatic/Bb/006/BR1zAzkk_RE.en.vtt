so<00:00:01.770> I'm<00:00:02.070> here<00:00:02.280> to<00:00:02.429> describe<00:00:02.820> the<00:00:03.179> project<00:00:03.600> that

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:03.720 
so I'm here to describe the project that

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:07.700 
so I'm here to describe the project that
I<00:00:03.810> built<00:00:04.110> which<00:00:05.060> Bluetooth<00:00:06.060> enables<00:00:06.810> an<00:00:07.200> old

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:07.710 
I built which Bluetooth enables an old

is configured with a canon hack
development<00:00:14.759> kit<00:00:14.969> and<00:00:15.350> this<00:00:16.350> is<00:00:16.500> a<00:00:16.529> open

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
development kit and this is a open

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:19.519 
development kit and this is a open

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
source firmware which among other things

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:22.010 
source firmware which among other things
makes<00:00:20.220> it<00:00:20.460> possible<00:00:20.640> to<00:00:20.970> remotely<00:00:21.630> control

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
makes it possible to remotely control

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.250 
makes it possible to remotely control
the<00:00:22.050> camera<00:00:22.619> so<00:00:23.609> in<00:00:23.730> this<00:00:23.820> case<00:00:24.090> I've<00:00:24.359> made<00:00:25.019> a

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
the camera so in this case I've made a

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.460 
the camera so in this case I've made a

runs on this order you know is basically

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:49.160 
runs on this order you know is basically
configured<00:00:45.780> to<00:00:45.809> handle<00:00:47.000> the<00:00:48.000> ble<00:00:48.600> connection

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
configured to handle the ble connection

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.240 
configured to handle the ble connection
and<00:00:49.579> to<00:00:50.579> receive<00:00:50.969> commands<00:00:51.390> and<00:00:51.800> execute<00:00:52.800> the

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
signal that this camera is supposed to

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:03.110 
signal that this camera is supposed to
detect<00:01:00.420> and<00:01:00.809> perform<00:01:01.170> different<00:01:01.410> things<00:01:02.120> so

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
detect and perform different things so

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:04.070 
detect and perform different things so
on<00:01:03.270> the<00:01:03.390> client<00:01:03.780> side

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
on the client side

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.640 
on the client side
I<00:01:04.379> run<00:01:04.949> the<00:01:05.159> evil<00:01:05.640> things<00:01:06.170> workbench<00:01:07.170> on<00:01:07.439> my

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
I run the evil things workbench on my

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.570 
I run the evil things workbench on my
computer<00:01:08.070> which<00:01:09.439> and<00:01:10.439> I<00:01:10.650> have<00:01:10.799> a<00:01:10.830> client<00:01:11.130> on<00:01:11.549> my

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
computer which and I have a client on my

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.370 
computer which and I have a client on my
iPhone<00:01:12.119> here<00:01:12.330> which<00:01:12.479> are<00:01:12.630> connected<00:01:13.110> to<00:01:13.229> the

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
iPhone here which are connected to the

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.820 
iPhone here which are connected to the
workbench<00:01:13.799> and<00:01:14.130> I've<00:01:14.820> executed<00:01:15.119> my

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:15.830 
workbench and I've executed my

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:18.679 
workbench and I've executed my
application<00:01:16.830> that<00:01:17.310> is<00:01:17.430> written<00:01:17.640> in<00:01:17.880> HTML<00:01:18.659> and

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
application that is written in HTML and

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:23.240 
application that is written in HTML and
JavaScript<00:01:20.060> so<00:01:21.110> this<00:01:22.110> application<00:01:22.320> basically

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
JavaScript so this application basically

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.170 
JavaScript so this application basically
just<00:01:23.580> connects<00:01:24.210> to<00:01:24.450> the<00:01:25.640> billy<00:01:26.640> board<00:01:26.909> and

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
just connects to the billy board and

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.550 
just connects to the billy board and
send<00:01:27.810> commands<00:01:28.439> so<00:01:29.430> let's<00:01:29.670> try<00:01:30.049> so<00:01:31.049> first<00:01:31.380> we

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
send commands so let's try so first we

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.649 
send commands so let's try so first we
connect<00:01:32.369> the<00:01:32.640> client<00:01:33.210> to<00:01:33.540> the<00:01:33.689> ble<00:01:34.170> board<00:01:35.659> now

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
connect the client to the ble board now

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.179 
connect the client to the ble board now
I'm<00:01:36.810> connected<00:01:37.320> and<00:01:37.530> there's<00:01:37.680> various

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
I'm connected and there's various

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.640 
I'm connected and there's various
graphics<00:01:38.460> going<00:01:38.970> back<00:01:39.150> and<00:01:39.299> forth<00:01:39.509> here<00:01:39.689> so<00:01:40.409> at

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
graphics going back and forth here so at

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.010 
graphics going back and forth here so at
first<00:01:40.829> I<00:01:41.220> try<00:01:41.909> too<00:01:41.970> soon<00:01:42.329> the<00:01:42.630> camera

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
first I try too soon the camera

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:49.750 
first I try too soon the camera
completely

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:49.760 

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:52.219 

now<00:01:50.760> the<00:01:50.820> camera<00:01:51.120> is<00:01:51.300> completely<00:01:51.570> zoomed<00:01:52.020> out

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
now the camera is completely zoomed out

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.680 
now the camera is completely zoomed out
and<00:01:52.909> wirelessly<00:01:53.909> I'm<00:01:54.150> going<00:01:54.390> to<00:01:54.479> take<00:01:54.659> a

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:54.690 
and wirelessly I'm going to take a

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:56.660 
and wirelessly I'm going to take a
picture<00:01:54.960> now<00:01:55.320> by<00:01:55.650> pressing<00:01:55.830> a<00:01:56.100> button<00:01:56.220> here<00:01:56.520> so

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
picture now by pressing a button here so

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.040 
picture now by pressing a button here so
it's<00:01:57.950> it<00:01:58.950> just<00:01:58.979> took<00:01:59.400> a<00:01:59.520> picture<00:01:59.970> and<00:02:00.330> now<00:02:00.869> I'm

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:01.050 
it's it just took a picture and now I'm

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:04.910 
it's it just took a picture and now I'm
going<00:02:01.229> to<00:02:01.320> disconnect<00:02:03.229> that's<00:02:04.229> basically<00:02:04.770> a

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
going to disconnect that's basically a

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.600 
going to disconnect that's basically a
short<00:02:05.460> presentation<00:02:05.640> of<00:02:07.190> Billy<00:02:08.190> and<00:02:08.490> they

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
short presentation of Billy and they

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.390 
short presentation of Billy and they
both<00:02:08.910> hold<00:02:09.509> the<00:02:09.899> digital<00:02:10.380> camera<00:02:10.800> from<00:02:11.009> Canon

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
both hold the digital camera from Canon

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:22.460 
both hold the digital camera from Canon
running<00:02:11.970> the<00:02:12.090> Canon<00:02:12.510> hack<00:02:12.660> development<00:02:13.170> kit
