luck of the draw in this game unless
you're<00:03:07.709> playing<00:03:07.890> one<00:03:08.160> finger<00:03:08.549> you<00:03:08.640> have<00:03:08.760> a

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
you're playing one finger you have a

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:11.750 
you're playing one finger you have a
little<00:03:09.060> more<00:03:09.420> control<00:03:09.780> over<00:03:09.900> it<00:03:10.290> I'd<00:03:10.440> say<00:03:10.760> but

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
little more control over it I'd say but

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:14.210 
little more control over it I'd say but
definitely<00:03:12.410> it's<00:03:13.410> definitely<00:03:13.560> kind<00:03:14.100> of

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.220 
definitely it's definitely kind of

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:19.630 
definitely it's definitely kind of
pretty<00:03:14.400> hard<00:03:14.670> to<00:03:14.790> shoot<00:03:14.970> in<00:03:15.090> this<00:03:15.209> game

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:19.640 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:22.270 

the<00:03:20.300> analog<00:03:20.720> sticks<00:03:21.050> pretty<00:03:21.350> responsive<00:03:22.069> most

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:22.280 
the analog sticks pretty responsive most

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:24.280 
the analog sticks pretty responsive most
of<00:03:22.430> the<00:03:22.520> time<00:03:22.790> sometimes<00:03:23.450> it<00:03:23.900> does<00:03:24.050> get<00:03:24.230> a

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:24.290 
of the time sometimes it does get a

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:26.740 
of the time sometimes it does get a
little<00:03:24.470> glitched<00:03:24.860> up<00:03:25.160> and<00:03:25.459> sometimes<00:03:26.390> the

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:26.750 
little glitched up and sometimes the

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:29.620 
little glitched up and sometimes the
game<00:03:26.959> does<00:03:27.260> a<00:03:27.430> ghost<00:03:28.430> glitch<00:03:28.760> up<00:03:29.000> on<00:03:29.209> you<00:03:29.450> and

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:29.630 
game does a ghost glitch up on you and

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:32.350 
game does a ghost glitch up on you and
then<00:03:30.170> this<00:03:30.380> is<00:03:30.560> a<00:03:30.590> fuse<00:03:31.040> I<00:03:31.490> guess<00:03:32.060> you<00:03:32.209> could

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:32.360 
then this is a fuse I guess you could

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:35.770 
then this is a fuse I guess you could
say<00:03:32.600> things<00:03:33.230> that<00:03:33.319> are<00:03:33.560> happening<00:03:34.510> so<00:03:35.510> you<00:03:35.600> see

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:35.780 
say things that are happening so you see

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:38.230 
say things that are happening so you see

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:12.260 

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.679 

I<00:04:12.400> personally<00:04:13.400> do<00:04:13.549> not<00:04:13.580> do<00:04:14.180> not<00:04:14.330> personally

00:04:14.679 --> 00:04:14.689 
I personally do not do not personally

00:04:14.689 --> 00:04:16.990 
I personally do not do not personally
think<00:04:15.470> this<00:04:15.620> game<00:04:15.830> is<00:04:15.890> as<00:04:16.100> great<00:04:16.489> as<00:04:16.639> it<00:04:16.669> is<00:04:16.970> on

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:17.000 
think this game is as great as it is on

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.689 
think this game is as great as it is on
the<00:04:17.299> consoles<00:04:17.810> on<00:04:18.019> the<00:04:18.590> consoles<00:04:19.070> it<00:04:19.280> is<00:04:19.430> a<00:04:19.459> lot

00:04:19.689 --> 00:04:19.699 
the consoles on the consoles it is a lot

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:21.849 
the consoles on the consoles it is a lot
better<00:04:19.970> and<00:04:20.180> easier<00:04:20.299> to<00:04:20.540> use<00:04:20.690> although<00:04:21.380> that

00:04:21.849 --> 00:04:21.859 
better and easier to use although that

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:25.210 
better and easier to use although that
can<00:04:22.040> be<00:04:22.280> I<00:04:22.690> guess<00:04:23.690> that<00:04:24.080> could<00:04:24.260> be<00:04:24.290> obvious

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:25.220 
can be I guess that could be obvious

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:27.400 
can be I guess that could be obvious
since<00:04:25.490> this<00:04:25.669> is<00:04:25.880> so<00:04:26.090> small<00:04:26.810> the<00:04:27.050> screen<00:04:27.380> I

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:27.410 
since this is so small the screen I

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:29.529 
since this is so small the screen I
wouldn't<00:04:27.860> say<00:04:27.949> the<00:04:28.070> ipad<00:04:28.430> small<00:04:28.880> but<00:04:29.180> I<00:04:29.210> mean

00:04:29.529 --> 00:04:29.539 
wouldn't say the ipad small but I mean

00:04:29.539 --> 00:04:32.409 
wouldn't say the ipad small but I mean
compared<00:04:30.350> to<00:04:30.500> the<00:04:30.620> xbox<00:04:31.130> or<00:04:31.370> ps3<00:04:31.550> our<00:04:32.000> system

00:04:32.409 --> 00:04:32.419 
compared to the xbox or ps3 our system

00:04:32.419 --> 00:04:35.260 
compared to the xbox or ps3 our system
such<00:04:32.660> as<00:04:32.690> that<00:04:33.490> those<00:04:34.490> are<00:04:34.639> going<00:04:34.760> to<00:04:34.820> be<00:04:34.970> a<00:04:35.000> lot

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:35.270 
such as that those are going to be a lot

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:39.790 
such as that those are going to be a lot
more<00:04:35.300> in<00:04:36.080> detail<00:04:37.389> but<00:04:38.389> if<00:04:38.990> you<00:04:39.289> were<00:04:39.440> playing

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:39.800 
more in detail but if you were playing

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:41.740 
more in detail but if you were playing
this<00:04:40.010> game<00:04:40.220> on<00:04:40.430> an<00:04:40.550> ipod<00:04:40.910> touch<00:04:41.150> or<00:04:41.300> iphone<00:04:41.449> i

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:41.750 
this game on an ipod touch or iphone i

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:43.629 
this game on an ipod touch or iphone i
definitely<00:04:42.410> would<00:04:42.560> not<00:04:42.680> recommend<00:04:43.310> it<00:04:43.430> it

00:04:43.629 --> 00:04:43.639 
definitely would not recommend it it

00:04:43.639 --> 00:04:46.719 
definitely would not recommend it it
would<00:04:43.789> be<00:04:43.940> very<00:04:44.180> hard<00:04:44.449> to<00:04:44.570> play<00:04:45.729> considering

00:04:46.719 --> 00:04:46.729 
would be very hard to play considering

00:04:46.729 --> 00:04:49.120 
would be very hard to play considering
the<00:04:46.850> small<00:04:47.180> screen<00:04:47.510> size<00:04:47.900> if<00:04:48.770> you're<00:04:48.949> going<00:04:49.070> to

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:49.130 
the small screen size if you're going to

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:50.740 
the small screen size if you're going to
get<00:04:49.280> the<00:04:49.460> game<00:04:49.639> i<00:04:49.820> recommend<00:04:50.300> getting<00:04:50.419> it<00:04:50.660> on

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:50.750 
get the game i recommend getting it on

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:53.770 
get the game i recommend getting it on
pipe<00:04:51.380> add<00:04:51.650> it's<00:04:51.919> not<00:04:52.100> a<00:04:52.130> it's<00:04:52.580> not<00:04:53.360> any<00:04:53.690> more

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:53.780 
pipe add it's not a it's not any more

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:56.320 
pipe add it's not a it's not any more
than<00:04:54.289> it<00:04:54.410> would<00:04:54.590> be<00:04:54.770> on<00:04:55.430> an<00:04:55.610> ipod<00:04:55.940> touch<00:04:56.150> your

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:56.330 
than it would be on an ipod touch your

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:59.850 
than it would be on an ipod touch your
iphone<00:04:57.550> the<00:04:58.550> cool<00:04:58.729> part<00:04:58.760> about<00:04:59.060> that<00:04:59.240> is<00:04:59.479> it's

00:04:59.850 --> 00:04:59.860 
iphone the cool part about that is it's

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:04.060 
iphone the cool part about that is it's
compatible<00:05:00.860> over<00:05:01.550> to<00:05:01.729> both<00:05:02.120> devices<00:05:02.710> the<00:05:03.710> same

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:04.070 
compatible over to both devices the same

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:06.340 
compatible over to both devices the same
so<00:05:04.430> there's<00:05:04.610> no<00:05:04.789> HD<00:05:05.330> version<00:05:05.720> on<00:05:05.810> the<00:05:05.840> iPad

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:06.350 
so there's no HD version on the iPad

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:08.920 
so there's no HD version on the iPad
quite<00:05:06.740> yet<00:05:07.039> there<00:05:07.970> might<00:05:08.180> be<00:05:08.210> in<00:05:08.449> the<00:05:08.539> future

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:08.930 
quite yet there might be in the future

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:11.890 
quite yet there might be in the future
I'm<00:05:09.169> not<00:05:09.800> quite<00:05:10.100> sure<00:05:10.449> alright<00:05:11.449> so<00:05:11.600> this<00:05:11.750> is

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:11.900 
I'm not quite sure alright so this is

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:14.740 
I'm not quite sure alright so this is
basically<00:05:12.080> the<00:05:12.470> game<00:05:12.800> here<00:05:13.250> I<00:05:13.400> won't<00:05:14.240> make<00:05:14.570> you
