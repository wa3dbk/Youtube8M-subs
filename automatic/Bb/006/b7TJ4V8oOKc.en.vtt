00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:15.280 
a co-payment very simply is just what

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:18.120 
a co-payment very simply is just what
the<00:00:15.670> setup<00:00:15.940> is<00:00:16.209> of<00:00:16.689> the<00:00:17.349> pedals<00:00:17.680> and<00:00:17.890> knee

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:18.130 
the setup is of the pedals and knee

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:20.820 
the setup is of the pedals and knee
levers<00:00:18.520> and<00:00:19.180> what<00:00:19.660> is<00:00:19.810> the<00:00:19.990> role<00:00:20.200> that<00:00:20.259> each<00:00:20.800> of

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:20.830 
levers and what is the role that each of

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:24.089 
levers and what is the role that each of
those<00:00:21.160> does<00:00:21.519> there<00:00:22.330> are<00:00:22.539> this<00:00:23.350> guitar<00:00:23.769> is<00:00:23.890> set

00:00:24.089 --> 00:00:24.099 
those does there are this guitar is set

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:27.779 
those does there are this guitar is set
up<00:00:24.250> in<00:00:24.460> a<00:00:24.609> very<00:00:24.939> common<00:00:25.539> typical<00:00:26.140> setup<00:00:26.650> and<00:00:27.010> in

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:27.789 
up in a very common typical setup and in

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:30.540 
up in a very common typical setup and in
this<00:00:27.970> case<00:00:28.240> Mike<00:00:28.810> Hopi<00:00:29.199> dn't<00:00:29.349> involves<00:00:30.189> three

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:30.550 
this case Mike Hopi dn't involves three

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:33.090 
this case Mike Hopi dn't involves three
pedals<00:00:30.759> which<00:00:31.359> is<00:00:31.539> very<00:00:32.019> very<00:00:32.410> common<00:00:32.949> for

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:33.100 
pedals which is very very common for

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:36.440 
pedals which is very very common for
this<00:00:33.430> type<00:00:33.640> of<00:00:33.670> guitar<00:00:33.970> and<00:00:34.420> five<00:00:35.260> knee<00:00:35.620> levers

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
this type of guitar and five knee levers

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.139 
this type of guitar and five knee levers
so<00:00:37.450> in<00:00:37.780> this<00:00:37.960> case<00:00:38.230> the<00:00:38.500> COPI<00:00:38.860> dn't<00:00:39.010> it's<00:00:39.280> we

00:00:40.139 --> 00:00:40.149 
so in this case the COPI dn't it's we

00:00:40.149 --> 00:00:43.020 
so in this case the COPI dn't it's we
have<00:00:40.300> the<00:00:40.480> a<00:00:40.510> B<00:00:41.170> and<00:00:41.440> C<00:00:41.710> pedals<00:00:42.010> which<00:00:42.879> is<00:00:43.000> a

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:43.030 
have the a B and C pedals which is a

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:46.549 
have the a B and C pedals which is a
very<00:00:43.360> common<00:00:43.899> set<00:00:44.620> up<00:00:44.800> for<00:00:45.100> the<00:00:45.309> modern

very common set up for the modern

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:50.580 
very common set up for the modern
iteration<00:00:47.559> the<00:00:48.190> a<00:00:48.219> pedal<00:00:49.230> raises<00:00:50.230> the<00:00:50.379> B

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:50.590 
iteration the a pedal raises the B

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:57.330 
iteration the a pedal raises the B
strings<00:00:51.579> a<00:00:52.620> whole<00:00:53.620> step<00:00:54.719> the<00:00:55.719> B<00:00:56.260> pedal<00:00:56.530> will

00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:57.340 
strings a whole step the B pedal will

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:01.590 
strings a whole step the B pedal will
raise<00:00:57.579> the<00:00:57.910> the<00:00:59.190> G<00:01:00.190> sharp<00:01:00.219> strings<00:01:00.910> a<00:01:01.239> half

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:01.600 
raise the the G sharp strings a half

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:04.590 
raise the the G sharp strings a half
step<00:01:02.399> now<00:01:03.399> when<00:01:03.969> you're<00:01:04.089> playing<00:01:04.330> an<00:01:04.449> E<00:01:04.570> chord

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:04.600 
step now when you're playing an E chord

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:06.990 
step now when you're playing an E chord
if<00:01:05.259> both<00:01:05.830> of<00:01:05.860> those<00:01:06.160> things<00:01:06.369> happen<00:01:06.640> at<00:01:06.910> the

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:07.000 
if both of those things happen at the

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.240 
if both of those things happen at the
same<00:01:07.180> time<00:01:07.509> which<00:01:07.990> is<00:01:08.020> a<00:01:08.170> lot<00:01:08.470> in<00:01:08.709> pedal<00:01:09.069> steel

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:09.250 
same time which is a lot in pedal steel

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:11.279 
same time which is a lot in pedal steel
playing<00:01:09.580> you're<00:01:10.030> gonna<00:01:10.179> get<00:01:10.390> suddenly<00:01:10.929> an<00:01:11.110> a

00:01:11.279 --> 00:01:11.289 
playing you're gonna get suddenly an a

00:01:11.289 --> 00:01:14.090 
playing you're gonna get suddenly an a
chord

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:19.670 

the<00:01:15.060> third<00:01:15.270> petal<00:01:16.430> raises<00:01:17.430> the<00:01:18.080> the<00:01:19.080> e<00:01:19.110> string

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
the third petal raises the the e string

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.380 
the third petal raises the the e string
and<00:01:19.920> the<00:01:20.100> B<00:01:20.250> string<00:01:20.610> a<00:01:20.850> whole<00:01:21.810> step<00:01:23.240> you<00:01:24.240> can

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
and the B string a whole step you can

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:30.320 
and the B string a whole step you can
use<00:01:24.510> it<00:01:24.660> alone<00:01:27.680> but<00:01:28.680> it's<00:01:28.979> most<00:01:29.700> commonly<00:01:30.090> used

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:30.330 
use it alone but it's most commonly used

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:36.070 
use it alone but it's most commonly used
with<00:01:30.780> the<00:01:31.080> B<00:01:31.229> pedal<00:01:31.470> to<00:01:31.920> make<00:01:32.100> a<00:01:32.310> minor<00:01:32.850> chord

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:36.080 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:38.300 

so<00:01:37.080> if<00:01:37.170> you're<00:01:37.290> on<00:01:37.380> the<00:01:37.470> G<00:01:37.650> fret<00:01:37.950> and<00:01:38.040> you<00:01:38.160> use

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
so if you're on the G fret and you use

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:39.920 
so if you're on the G fret and you use
the<00:01:38.460> B<00:01:38.580> and<00:01:38.729> C<00:01:38.790> pedals<00:01:38.940> you<00:01:39.360> get<00:01:39.509> an<00:01:39.600> a<00:01:39.690> minor

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
the B and C pedals you get an a minor

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.859 
the B and C pedals you get an a minor
chord<00:01:40.940> you<00:01:41.940> also<00:01:42.180> hear<00:01:42.360> it<00:01:42.390> a<00:01:42.479> lot<00:01:42.600> in<00:01:42.660> this

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
chord you also hear it a lot in this

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:49.580 
chord you also hear it a lot in this
kind<00:01:43.080> of<00:01:43.170> leg

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.069 

okay<00:01:50.549> so<00:01:50.610> that's<00:01:50.880> it<00:01:51.030> for<00:01:51.180> the<00:01:51.299> petals<00:01:51.659> now<00:01:51.869> the

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
okay so that's it for the petals now the

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:53.630 
okay so that's it for the petals now the
knee<00:01:52.470> levers<00:01:52.829> do<00:01:53.100> a<00:01:53.130> bunch<00:01:53.369> of<00:01:53.490> different

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
knee levers do a bunch of different

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.350 
knee levers do a bunch of different
stuff<00:01:54.329> very<00:01:54.750> common<00:01:55.170> set<00:01:55.380> up<00:01:55.530> is<00:01:56.070> the<00:01:56.610> left

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
stuff very common set up is the left

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:58.969 
stuff very common set up is the left
knee<00:01:57.630> lever<00:01:57.840> going<00:01:58.140> left<00:01:58.350> will<00:01:58.530> raise<00:01:58.710> your

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
knee lever going left will raise your

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:03.499 
knee lever going left will raise your
ease<00:01:59.220> a<00:02:00.560> half<00:02:01.560> step<00:02:01.890> likewise<00:02:02.670> the<00:02:03.000> left<00:02:03.210> knee

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
ease a half step likewise the left knee

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:06.649 
ease a half step likewise the left knee
going<00:02:03.930> right<00:02:04.490> is<00:02:05.490> going<00:02:05.700> to<00:02:05.759> lower<00:02:06.090> the<00:02:06.450> ease<00:02:06.630> a

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
going right is going to lower the ease a

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:08.900 
going right is going to lower the ease a
half<00:02:07.049> step<00:02:07.350> the<00:02:08.069> right<00:02:08.250> knee<00:02:08.399> lever<00:02:08.610> going

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
half step the right knee lever going

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:13.520 
half step the right knee lever going
left<00:02:09.179> is<00:02:09.450> a<00:02:09.539> tricky<00:02:10.170> one<00:02:10.319> does<00:02:10.890> many<00:02:11.190> things<00:02:12.530> it

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
left is a tricky one does many things it

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.430 
left is a tricky one does many things it
lowers<00:02:14.040> the<00:02:14.280> six-string<00:02:14.760> a<00:02:14.849> whole<00:02:15.030> step<00:02:15.440> and

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
lowers the six-string a whole step and

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:20.030 
lowers the six-string a whole step and
on<00:02:16.800> my<00:02:17.010> guitar<00:02:17.480> it<00:02:18.480> raises<00:02:19.200> the<00:02:19.410> first<00:02:19.709> string

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
on my guitar it raises the first string

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:21.770 
on my guitar it raises the first string
a<00:02:20.130> whole<00:02:20.310> step<00:02:20.550> and<00:02:20.819> the<00:02:20.910> second<00:02:21.300> string<00:02:21.569> a

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
a whole step and the second string a

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:23.420 
a whole step and the second string a
half<00:02:21.959> step<00:02:22.260> so<00:02:22.530> you've<00:02:22.799> got<00:02:22.980> this<00:02:23.100> kind<00:02:23.280> of

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
half step so you've got this kind of

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:26.479 
half step so you've got this kind of
unusual<00:02:23.700> thing<00:02:24.590> where<00:02:25.590> that<00:02:25.769> goes<00:02:25.980> up<00:02:26.250> and

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:26.489 
unusual thing where that goes up and

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:30.289 
unusual thing where that goes up and
that<00:02:27.410> goes<00:02:28.410> down<00:02:28.709> luckily<00:02:29.519> you<00:02:29.610> don't<00:02:29.730> well

00:02:30.289 --> 00:02:30.299 
that goes down luckily you don't well

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:31.699 
that goes down luckily you don't well
for<00:02:30.540> obvious<00:02:30.810> reasons<00:02:31.110> you<00:02:31.230> don't<00:02:31.319> use<00:02:31.530> these

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:31.709 
for obvious reasons you don't use these

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:34.130 
for obvious reasons you don't use these
very<00:02:31.890> often<00:02:32.069> together<00:02:32.340> there<00:02:33.209> are<00:02:33.239> cases<00:02:33.959> of

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
very often together there are cases of

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:37.520 
very often together there are cases of
adding<00:02:34.620> another<00:02:35.430> knee<00:02:35.700> lever<00:02:35.940> further<00:02:36.810> in<00:02:37.049> to

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
adding another knee lever further in to

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:39.440 
adding another knee lever further in to
separate<00:02:37.980> those<00:02:38.160> functions<00:02:38.670> so<00:02:38.970> that<00:02:39.120> you<00:02:39.239> can

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
separate those functions so that you can

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:42.680 
separate those functions so that you can
have<00:02:40.250> more<00:02:41.250> flexibility<00:02:41.970> in<00:02:42.180> terms<00:02:42.209> of<00:02:42.569> what

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
have more flexibility in terms of what

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:43.190 
have more flexibility in terms of what
you're<00:02:42.870> doing

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
you're doing

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.280 
you're doing
finally<00:02:44.010> the<00:02:44.340> very<00:02:44.880> left<00:02:45.209> lever<00:02:45.690> the<00:02:46.019> right

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
finally the very left lever the right

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:48.620 
finally the very left lever the right
going<00:02:46.709> right<00:02:46.739> will<00:02:47.549> lower<00:02:47.819> your<00:02:48.150> second

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:48.630 
going right will lower your second

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:52.940 
going right will lower your second
string<00:02:48.900> a<00:02:49.220> half<00:02:50.220> step<00:02:50.519> and<00:02:51.319> then<00:02:52.319> you<00:02:52.620> feel

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
string a half step and then you feel

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:56.060 
string a half step and then you feel
that<00:02:53.549> it's<00:02:53.730> joining<00:02:54.180> the<00:02:54.600> ninth<00:02:54.840> string<00:02:55.230> in

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:56.070 
that it's joining the ninth string in

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:59.199 
that it's joining the ninth string in
the<00:02:56.880> unison<00:02:57.420> and<00:02:57.600> then<00:02:57.870> is<00:02:58.049> a<00:02:58.079> special<00:02:58.500> bonus

00:02:59.199 --> 00:02:59.209 
the unison and then is a special bonus

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:03.440 
the unison and then is a special bonus
they<00:03:00.209> will<00:03:00.390> both<00:03:01.280> go<00:03:02.280> down<00:03:02.579> yet<00:03:02.940> another<00:03:03.060> half

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
they will both go down yet another half

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:05.809 
they will both go down yet another half
step<00:03:03.600> so<00:03:04.440> that's<00:03:04.650> that's<00:03:05.010> you<00:03:05.519> get<00:03:05.670> your

00:03:05.809 --> 00:03:05.819 
step so that's that's you get your

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:08.470 
step so that's that's you get your
seventh<00:03:06.239> by<00:03:06.480> lowering<00:03:06.870> the<00:03:07.170> half<00:03:07.380> step<00:03:07.680> here

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:08.480 
seventh by lowering the half step here

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:11.170 
seventh by lowering the half step here
that's<00:03:09.480> a

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:11.180 
that's a

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:13.910 
that's a
that's<00:03:12.180> an<00:03:12.360> e<00:03:12.450> 7th<00:03:12.810> chord<00:03:13.140> and<00:03:13.350> if<00:03:13.560> you<00:03:13.650> lower

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920 
that's an e 7th chord and if you lower

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:16.790 
that's an e 7th chord and if you lower
it<00:03:14.100> just<00:03:14.220> a<00:03:14.370> little<00:03:14.610> more<00:03:15.380> that's<00:03:16.380> gonna<00:03:16.560> be

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:16.800 
it just a little more that's gonna be

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:21.290 
it just a little more that's gonna be
your<00:03:16.920> 6th<00:03:17.340> the<00:03:17.910> likewise<00:03:18.450> the<00:03:18.800> this<00:03:19.800> lower<00:03:20.300> D

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:21.300 
your 6th the likewise the this lower D

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:23.780 
your 6th the likewise the this lower D
string<00:03:21.630> gets<00:03:21.840> lowered<00:03:22.140> to<00:03:22.260> c-sharp<00:03:22.440> also<00:03:23.069> so

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
string gets lowered to c-sharp also so

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:25.580 
string gets lowered to c-sharp also so
that's<00:03:24.030> basically<00:03:24.480> it<00:03:24.600> for<00:03:24.900> the<00:03:25.050> COPI<00:03:25.440> dn't

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:25.590 
that's basically it for the COPI dn't

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:28.310 
that's basically it for the COPI dn't
