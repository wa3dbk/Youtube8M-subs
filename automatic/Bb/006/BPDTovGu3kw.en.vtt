00:00:09.349 --> 00:00:14.309
 hello people and welcome here at 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:16.680
 package today I want to show you kneading 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:18.750
 yes of course no normal play dough 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.400
 Here's what's called intelligent play dough 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.329
 intelligent knead a wonderful 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:26.430
 toys to relax or even a 

00:00:23.329 --> 00:00:28.200
 real gift because this knead 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.969
 show you here has a few completely 

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:31.410
 interesting features there are 

00:00:29.969 --> 00:00:33.960
 Of course in different colors I 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:37.050
 have now the blue variant and 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.789
 also the silver variant and the play dough 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.170
 can do a lot so you can of course 

00:00:38.789 --> 00:00:42.420
 for a normal 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.590
 Knead around here and any 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.390
 make shapes out of it 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.880
 but he also knows the example 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.010
 knead as long as a bubble gum 

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:53.100
 you can see that is very very elastic 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.970
 and with that you can do all sorts of things 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.680
 participate 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:57.750
 somehow merge and also 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.660
 Knead again together 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.610
 so far that is so first there is nothing 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.170
 special one of the special 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:06.600
 characteristics of the dough is theirs 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.950
 abnormal viscosity that means nothing 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.840
 more than that, I simply do it 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.549
 slowly pull apart 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.700
 but once I get it fast 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:17.969
 attract and exert pressure 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:20.369
 Well that did not work out again 

00:01:17.969 --> 00:01:23.670
 have you seen it, just travel ? 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:27.149
 who traveled very smoothly apart the 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:29.579
 means when you exercise a force quickly 

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:31.770
 then the material hardens and is hardened 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:32.579
 not anymore that was you you have it 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.889
 seen again 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:37.740
 So that's the one property 

00:01:34.889 --> 00:01:39.060
 abnormal viscosity to another one can 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.770
 Maybe we do not recognize that anymore 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.359
 You can go up here like this 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.999
 see a slight glitter 

00:01:42.359 --> 00:01:47.789
 where the whole thing is broken that lies 

00:01:44.999 --> 00:01:50.939
 in that in the play with half shavings 

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:54.029
 are involved and that makes that 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:55.020
 whole plasticine here magnetic that 

00:01:54.029 --> 00:01:56.700
 means he becomes a small magnet 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.799
 supplied itself already if I the 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.419
 here just starts to put it that way 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:03.029
 he also already directly in this mass 

00:02:00.419 --> 00:02:05.279
 to draw in and thus enable 

00:02:03.029 --> 00:02:06.539
 only a few gimmicks you 

00:02:05.279 --> 00:02:08.819
 So do it with it 

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:11.640
 For one thing, of course, you can do the whole thing 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:14.430
 make it look like year is like the dough 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.480
 a living being so to say to her 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:17.310
 You can do this a bit 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.140
 longer pull that we have one here 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:20.220
 have small brussels and then we go 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:23.430
 with the kneading just 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:27.140
 get a little closer and then get 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:30.080
 the whole a life as you see 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:33.720
 You see, if you do it right then 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:36.360
 so follows this proboscis then the 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:39.600
 magnets and the whole looks so very 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:41.310
 interesting and funny you can see 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:42.690
 do not even have to touch it if 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:46.380
 you can get it done then you can do it all 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:49.440
 So hover here or he just lays 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:50.460
 And then the crowd moves to the 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:52.590
 magnets down 

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:55.470
 So there you can play all sorts of games 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:57.959
 join in so that's the second one 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:01.650
 property the kneading the whole 

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:03.780
 plasticine here is very magnetic 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:06.510
 interesting as I said alone that rum 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:08.040
 kneading is fun but there are 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:09.330
 another special feature if you are now 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:12.990
 For example, here's a little one 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:15.000
 ball turns out then you can see 

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:17.400
 that the whole thing is very elastic 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:21.300
 and you can play with it as with 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:25.050
 a gum when you see it all 

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:26.760
 so jump around here like a gum and 

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:29.250
 You can still easily do it here 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:30.989
 flatten press and then you have too 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:32.459
 again the normal plasticine in 

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:33.900
 it really is a very 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:36.870
 interesting material if you are here 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:39.900
 now the whole thing a bit flat 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:41.400
 So we say like a piece of paper 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:43.610
 just a bit flat then you can 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:46.230
 tear it all up too 

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:48.989
 and you have a very smooth one here 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:51.000
 You can do that too 

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:54.060
 do it again and then you can do it too 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:56.160
 knead again directly into each other and 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:58.440
 twist and then has normal again 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:00.660
 You can already do this with plasticine 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:02.459
 See that the pious if you which 

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:04.049
 It builds up again very quickly 

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:07.080
 that means within a few 

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:09.390
 minutes it becomes a relative again 

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:10.950
 smooth mass and the whole runs 

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:12.239
 Again I just put it here 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:16.500
 in the background then you can do that 

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:18.600
 maybe see and that's the way it is yes 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:20.820
 these are the properties that the 

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:23.130
 knead here so with it so bring the 

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:25.110
 play around on the couch or something to 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:27.630
 relax this is really one 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:29.190
 very wonderful story and alone 

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:31.529
 already because of this magnetic 

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:33.989
 Features make it easy 

00:04:31.529 --> 00:04:36.209
 messing around with that is that 

00:04:33.989 --> 00:04:37.919
 magnetic dough people the intelligent 

00:04:36.209 --> 00:04:39.809
 knead those you can buy of course 

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:41.009
 also amazon for example I will 

00:04:39.809 --> 00:04:43.109
 I left the below in the video 

00:04:41.009 --> 00:04:44.879
 pack description and if you still 

00:04:43.109 --> 00:04:47.189
 a gift is looking for someone who 

00:04:44.879 --> 00:04:48.929
 something is interested in unusual 

00:04:47.189 --> 00:04:51.259
 hire or predisposed little jealous 

00:04:48.929 --> 00:04:53.309
 then i can give you the here 

00:04:51.259 --> 00:04:55.499
 ferromagnetic smart play 

00:04:53.309 --> 00:04:56.999
 absolutely recommend that really works 

00:04:55.499 --> 00:04:59.909
 fun to play with 

00:04:56.999 --> 00:05:01.679
 it does not fall that means there has 

00:04:59.909 --> 00:05:02.099
 no sticky feeling backwards 

00:05:01.679 --> 00:05:03.659
 fumble 

00:05:02.099 --> 00:05:06.359
 so you can easily with it 

00:05:03.659 --> 00:05:10.169
 play around and use the whole and so 

00:05:06.359 --> 00:05:11.699
 that's really fun and that's it 

00:05:10.169 --> 00:05:13.589
 then I have been again 

00:05:11.699 --> 00:05:14.999
 Hope you enjoyed it and you 

00:05:13.589 --> 00:05:17.099
 will also switch again next time 

00:05:14.999 --> 00:05:45.389
 a here with me the parquet and parquet 

00:05:17.099 --> 00:05:47.819
 I say at tutorials and 

00:05:45.389 --> 00:05:49.829
 instructions for you interesting 

00:05:47.819 --> 00:05:53.819

 also at facebook twitter and quiet 

00:05:56.699 --> 00:06:03.619
 and at www.realtech.de children popkomm 

00:06:00.359 --> 00:06:03.619
 her heaven
