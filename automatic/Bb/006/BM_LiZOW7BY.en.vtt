of that is embracing those parts that

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:33.740 
of that is embracing those parts that

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:56.340 
judgments we have on these parts of

00:05:56.340 --> 00:05:59.000 
judgments we have on these parts of
ourselves<00:05:56.510> and<00:05:57.510> you<00:05:57.660> know<00:05:57.780> it's<00:05:58.140> for<00:05:58.830> all<00:05:58.860> of

00:05:59.000 --> 00:05:59.010 
ourselves and you know it's for all of

00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:00.650 
ourselves and you know it's for all of
you<00:05:59.160> who<00:05:59.190> are<00:05:59.400> sitting<00:05:59.580> here<00:05:59.910> you<00:06:00.270> don't<00:06:00.420> see

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:00.660 
you who are sitting here you don't see

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:02.030 
you who are sitting here you don't see
it<00:06:00.780> that<00:06:00.810> way<00:06:00.930> because<00:06:01.140> that<00:06:01.410> may<00:06:01.530> not<00:06:01.710> be<00:06:01.860> your

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:02.040 
it that way because that may not be your

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:04.150 
it that way because that may not be your
stuff<00:06:02.400> you<00:06:02.940> don't<00:06:03.090> have<00:06:03.240> a<00:06:03.270> judgment<00:06:03.750> about

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:04.160 
stuff you don't have a judgment about

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:07.370 
stuff you don't have a judgment about
maybe<00:06:05.160> let's<00:06:05.490> say<00:06:05.580> if<00:06:05.880> you're<00:06:06.090> maybe<00:06:07.080> not<00:06:07.200> a

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:07.380 
maybe let's say if you're maybe not a

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:09.890 
maybe let's say if you're maybe not a
supermodel<00:06:07.920> you<00:06:08.730> you're<00:06:09.120> not<00:06:09.240> going<00:06:09.510> through

00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:09.900 
supermodel you you're not going through

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:12.380 
supermodel you you're not going through
the<00:06:10.620> wiring<00:06:11.340> that<00:06:11.520> that<00:06:11.700> person<00:06:12.090> is<00:06:12.180> going

00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:12.390 
the wiring that that person is going

00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:13.910 
the wiring that that person is going
through<00:06:12.480> in<00:06:12.720> their<00:06:12.840> heads<00:06:13.080> these<00:06:13.620> would<00:06:13.800> be

00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:13.920 
through in their heads these would be

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:15.290 
through in their heads these would be
how<00:06:14.160> they<00:06:14.340> are<00:06:14.460> perceived<00:06:14.670> in<00:06:15.000> the<00:06:15.060> world

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:15.300 
how they are perceived in the world

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:17.300 
how they are perceived in the world
you've<00:06:15.840> got<00:06:16.050> your<00:06:16.260> own<00:06:16.770> you<00:06:17.100> get<00:06:17.220> what

you've got your own you get what
I'm<00:06:17.400> saying<00:06:17.610> you<00:06:18.570> got<00:06:18.780> to<00:06:18.810> find<00:06:19.050> a<00:06:19.170> way<00:06:19.200> of

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:19.290 
I'm saying you got to find a way of

00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:21.590 
I'm saying you got to find a way of
coming<00:06:19.530> to<00:06:19.680> terms<00:06:19.710> with<00:06:20.010> that<00:06:20.130> people<00:06:20.490> I<00:06:20.700> still

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:21.600 
coming to terms with that people I still

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:25.790 
coming to terms with that people I still
know<00:06:21.690> what<00:06:21.810> you're<00:06:21.900> going<00:06:22.020> to<00:06:22.080> work<00:06:24.530> then<00:06:25.530> you

00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:25.800 
know what you're going to work then you

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:27.110 
know what you're going to work then you
know<00:06:25.950> the<00:06:26.190> interesting<00:06:26.310> thing<00:06:26.700> about<00:06:26.730> that<00:06:27.060> is

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:27.120 
know the interesting thing about that is

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:29.510 
know the interesting thing about that is
you<00:06:27.450> either<00:06:27.900> in<00:06:28.230> one<00:06:28.680> of<00:06:28.710> two<00:06:28.980> ways<00:06:29.010> in<00:06:29.220> the

you either in one of two ways in the
work<00:06:29.700> one<00:06:29.910> of<00:06:30.000> two<00:06:30.120> things<00:06:30.150> happens<00:06:30.419> if<00:06:30.990> you

00:06:31.159 --> 00:06:31.169 
work one of two things happens if you

00:06:31.169 --> 00:06:33.890 
work one of two things happens if you
can't<00:06:31.410> find<00:06:31.650> a<00:06:31.830> way<00:06:31.979> of<00:06:32.280> embracing<00:06:33.270> the<00:06:33.510> parts

00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:33.900 
can't find a way of embracing the parts

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:35.730 
can't find a way of embracing the parts
that<00:06:34.530> are

00:06:35.730 --> 00:06:35.740 
that are

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:38.580 
that are
fully<00:06:36.039> integrated<00:06:36.900> into<00:06:37.900> who<00:06:38.050> you<00:06:38.110> are<00:06:38.380> yet

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:38.590 
fully integrated into who you are yet

00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:39.990 
fully integrated into who you are yet
either<00:06:39.069> you're<00:06:39.280> going<00:06:39.400> to<00:06:39.460> overcompensate

that's<00:06:48.940> it<00:06:49.180> those<00:06:49.630> two<00:06:49.870> things<00:06:50.050> are<00:06:50.259> the<00:06:50.380> only

00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:50.500 
that's it those two things are the only

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:51.990 
that's it those two things are the only
two<00:06:50.680> things<00:06:50.860> that<00:06:50.979> happen<00:06:51.370> in<00:06:51.460> acting<00:06:51.819> work

00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:52.000 
two things that happen in acting work

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.570 
two things that happen in acting work
you<00:06:52.569> either<00:06:52.720> overcompensate<00:06:53.620> means<00:06:54.130> you<00:06:54.250> push

00:06:54.570 --> 00:06:54.580 
you either overcompensate means you push

00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:58.680 
you either overcompensate means you push
you<00:06:55.389> act<00:06:56.759> you<00:06:57.759> are<00:06:57.910> truant<00:06:58.240> you<00:06:58.539> are

you act you are truant you are

00:06:58.690 --> 00:07:01.559 
you act you are truant you are
essentially<00:06:59.620> hiding<00:07:00.130> the<00:07:00.490> part<00:07:00.819> that<00:07:01.090> is<00:07:01.389> the

00:07:01.559 --> 00:07:01.569 
essentially hiding the part that is the

00:07:01.569 --> 00:07:02.879 
essentially hiding the part that is the
stuff<00:07:01.810> that<00:07:01.840> you're<00:07:02.110> needing<00:07:02.440> but<00:07:02.710> you're
