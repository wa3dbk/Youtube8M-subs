00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:18.890

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:20.720
 sweet potato fries there you 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:23.750

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:25.580
 peeled and cut in fact 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:28.510
 roughly his highs a little bit of 

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:43.969
 potatoes then you will you the stalls and 

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:45.170
 well flat the goal if it is not necessary that she 

00:00:43.969 --> 00:00:51.559
 be on top of each other 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:58.699
 okay, we're a little spray 

00:00:51.559 --> 00:01:03.760
 of olive oil fight paurise on it 

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:03.760

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:48.040
 more if you do not contain a lot of 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:50.160
 monounsaturated fats so this is a 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:53.500
 strike that is good enough for health 

00:01:50.160 --> 00:02:06.670
