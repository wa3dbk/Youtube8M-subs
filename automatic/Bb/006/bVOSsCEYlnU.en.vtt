collector<00:01:32.600> a<00:01:34.000> little<00:01:35.000> drop<00:01:35.329> back<00:01:35.569> there<00:01:36.609> it

00:01:37.599 --> 00:01:37.609 
collector a little drop back there it

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:39.160 
collector a little drop back there it
might<00:01:37.759> be<00:01:37.909> because<00:01:38.240> of<00:01:38.270> the<00:01:38.420> camera<00:01:38.750> add<00:01:38.899> it<00:01:39.049> to

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:39.170 
might be because of the camera add it to

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:43.529 
might be because of the camera add it to
it<00:01:40.539> yeah<00:01:41.560> getting<00:01:42.560> a<00:01:42.590> lot<00:01:42.740> of<00:01:42.770> dropouts<00:01:43.250> there

00:01:43.529 --> 00:01:43.539 
it yeah getting a lot of dropouts there

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:45.880 
it yeah getting a lot of dropouts there
but<00:01:44.539> the<00:01:44.659> camera<00:01:45.020> on<00:01:45.110> this<00:01:45.530> has<00:01:45.739> happened

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:45.890 
but the camera on this has happened

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:50.979 
but the camera on this has happened
before<00:01:46.189> with<00:01:46.610> the<00:01:47.590> l<00:01:48.590> 60<00:01:49.039> 52<00:01:49.750> when<00:01:50.750> you<00:01:50.840> add<00:01:50.959> a

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:50.989 
before with the l 60 52 when you add a

00:01:50.989 --> 00:01:54.309 
before with the l 60 52 when you add a
camera<00:01:51.349> to<00:01:51.679> it<00:01:52.119> it<00:01:53.119> blocks<00:01:53.420> the<00:01:53.569> antenna<00:01:53.959> so<00:01:54.079> I

00:01:54.309 --> 00:01:54.319 
camera to it it blocks the antenna so I

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:56.770 
camera to it it blocks the antenna so I
might<00:01:54.799> want<00:01:54.950> to<00:01:54.979> open<00:01:55.250> up<00:01:55.369> this<00:01:55.520> quadcopter<00:01:55.789> to

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:56.780 
might want to open up this quadcopter to

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:03.520 
might want to open up this quadcopter to
look<00:01:56.959> at<00:01:57.110> its<00:01:57.259> antenna<00:02:02.140> pretty<00:02:03.140> high<00:02:03.319> right

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:03.530 
look at its antenna pretty high right

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:08.699 
look at its antenna pretty high right
now<00:02:03.560> but

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:08.709 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:10.800 

so<00:02:09.219> there<00:02:09.429> is<00:02:09.549> an<00:02:09.700> antenna<00:02:10.060> issue<00:02:10.299> on<00:02:10.659> the

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:10.810 
so there is an antenna issue on the

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:13.440 
so there is an antenna issue on the
quadcopter<00:02:11.379> itself<00:02:11.469> with<00:02:11.920> the<00:02:12.010> camera<00:02:12.450> and

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
quadcopter itself with the camera and

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:15.750 
quadcopter itself with the camera and
with<00:02:14.230> horizontal<00:02:14.560> flight<00:02:15.010> for<00:02:15.219> some<00:02:15.430> reason

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 
with horizontal flight for some reason

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.349 
with horizontal flight for some reason
I'm<00:02:16.480> a<00:02:16.540> good<00:02:16.930> vertical<00:02:17.349> flight<00:02:17.500> right<00:02:17.709> now

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:18.359 
I'm a good vertical flight right now

00:02:18.359 --> 00:02:20.670 
I'm a good vertical flight right now
I've<00:02:19.359> got<00:02:19.510> some<00:02:19.540> good<00:02:19.870> out<00:02:20.049> to<00:02:20.319> them<00:02:20.439> on<00:02:20.530> this

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:43.020 

I<00:03:41.010> don't<00:03:42.010> know<00:03:42.100> what<00:03:42.250> those<00:03:42.340> hiccups<00:03:42.730> were<00:03:42.880> on

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:43.030 
I don't know what those hiccups were on

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:45.030 
I don't know what those hiccups were on
the<00:03:43.120> other<00:03:43.240> end<00:03:43.420> of<00:03:43.480> the<00:03:43.570> field<00:03:43.810> there<00:03:44.050> okay

I'm<00:03:45.130> seeing<00:03:45.310> hiccups<00:03:45.640> out<00:03:45.940> there<00:03:46.710> so<00:03:47.710> I<00:03:47.740> think

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:48.130 
I'm seeing hiccups out there so I think

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:50.850 
I'm seeing hiccups out there so I think
the<00:03:48.220> camera<00:03:48.750> is<00:03:49.750> creating<00:03:50.320> some<00:03:50.530> interference

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:50.860 
the camera is creating some interference

00:03:50.860 --> 00:04:12.390 
the camera is creating some interference
in<00:03:51.100> the<00:03:51.190> antenna

hiccups<00:04:23.020> you<00:04:24.020> know<00:04:24.110> could<00:04:24.320> lift<00:04:24.530> easily<00:04:24.979> lift

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:25.190 
hiccups you know could lift easily lift

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:29.680 
hiccups you know could lift easily lift
the<00:04:25.310> camera<00:04:28.090> but<00:04:29.090> I<00:04:29.120> would<00:04:29.330> see<00:04:29.479> some

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:29.690 
the camera but I would see some

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:31.390 
the camera but I would see some
hesitation<00:04:30.260> so<00:04:30.380> I'm<00:04:30.470> not<00:04:30.590> able<00:04:30.860> to<00:04:31.040> get<00:04:31.250> that

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:31.400 
hesitation so I'm not able to get that

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:34.570 
hesitation so I'm not able to get that
150<00:04:32.389> 200<00:04:32.750> meter<00:04:32.900> range<00:04:33.169> that<00:04:33.440> I<00:04:33.530> normally<00:04:34.160> get

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:34.580 
150 200 meter range that I normally get

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:37.420 
150 200 meter range that I normally get
without<00:04:35.210> the<00:04:35.270> camera<00:04:35.949> I'm<00:04:36.949> only<00:04:37.130> getting

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:37.430 
without the camera I'm only getting

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:39.280 
without the camera I'm only getting
about<00:04:37.639> 70<00:04:37.970> meters<00:04:38.240> which<00:04:38.419> is<00:04:38.449> about<00:04:38.870> the<00:04:39.080> same

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:39.290 
about 70 meters which is about the same

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:42.640 
about 70 meters which is about the same
as<00:04:39.560> the<00:04:40.460> syma<00:04:41.060> x5c<00:04:41.419> which<00:04:41.840> this<00:04:42.020> is<00:04:42.229> a<00:04:42.260> clone<00:04:42.620> of

with<00:04:43.400> the<00:04:43.550> camera<00:04:43.880> attached<00:04:47.440> so<00:04:48.610> we're<00:04:49.610> not

00:04:49.689 --> 00:04:49.699 
with the camera attached so we're not

00:04:49.699 --> 00:04:52.270 
with the camera attached so we're not
talking<00:04:49.910> about<00:04:50.530> significant<00:04:51.530> reduction<00:04:52.160> in

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:52.280 
talking about significant reduction in

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:54.879 
talking about significant reduction in
performance<00:04:52.550> here<00:04:53.090> it's<00:04:53.870> just<00:04:54.080> it<00:04:54.260> with<00:04:54.770> the

00:04:54.879 --> 00:04:54.889 
performance here it's just it with the

00:04:54.889 --> 00:04:56.680 
performance here it's just it with the
camera<00:04:55.190> attached<00:04:55.550> it<00:04:55.760> performs<00:04:56.270> about<00:04:56.570> the

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:56.690 
camera attached it performs about the

00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:58.090 
camera attached it performs about the
same<00:04:56.930> as<00:04:57.110> the<00:04:57.229> syma<00:04:57.530> x5c

00:04:58.090 --> 00:04:58.100 
same as the syma x5c

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:00.670 
same as the syma x5c
and<00:04:58.340> that<00:04:59.330> makes<00:04:59.539> me<00:04:59.660> wonder<00:04:59.930> does<00:05:00.440> that

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:00.680 
and that makes me wonder does that

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:02.400 
and that makes me wonder does that
camera<00:05:01.190> on<00:05:01.220> the<00:05:01.460> syma<00:05:01.789> x5c

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:02.410 
camera on the syma x5c

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:04.659 
camera on the syma x5c
become<00:05:03.410> the<00:05:03.530> issue<00:05:03.710> of<00:05:04.130> why<00:05:04.340> it's<00:05:04.520> getting

00:05:04.659 --> 00:05:04.669 
become the issue of why it's getting

00:05:04.669 --> 00:05:08.950 
become the issue of why it's getting
such<00:05:05.030> why<00:05:05.840> the<00:05:05.900> x5c<00:05:06.620> gets<00:05:07.520> such<00:05:08.360> poor<00:05:08.630> range

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:08.960 
such why the x5c gets such poor range

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:11.650 
such why the x5c gets such poor range
maybe<00:05:09.410> it's<00:05:09.620> that<00:05:09.740> camera<00:05:10.010> blocking<00:05:10.660> blocking

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:11.660 
maybe it's that camera blocking blocking

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:24.600 
maybe it's that camera blocking blocking
the<00:05:11.960> signal<00:05:12.380> somehow

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:24.610

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:41.310 
with an 808 keychain camera yes it can

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:43.580 
with an 808 keychain camera yes it can
lift<00:06:41.520> it<00:06:41.669> there<00:06:42.330> are<00:06:42.569> there<00:06:43.169> is<00:06:43.199> an<00:06:43.470> issue

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:43.590 
lift it there are there is an issue

00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:46.010 
lift it there are there is an issue
there<00:06:43.919> though<00:06:44.160> with<00:06:44.430> horizontal<00:06:45.210> range<00:06:45.720> for

00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:46.020 
there though with horizontal range for

00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:47.900 
there though with horizontal range for
some<00:06:46.199> reason<00:06:46.500> I<00:06:46.680> was<00:06:47.190> only<00:06:47.340> getting<00:06:47.550> not<00:06:47.729> to

00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:47.910 
some reason I was only getting not to

00:06:47.910 --> 00:06:52.640 
some reason I was only getting not to
but<00:06:48.060> I'd<00:06:48.870> say<00:06:49.169> about<00:06:49.349> 60<00:06:49.710> 60<00:06:50.699> meters<00:06:51.470> close<00:06:52.470> to

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:52.650 
but I'd say about 60 60 meters close to

00:06:52.650 --> 00:06:56.300 
but I'd say about 60 60 meters close to
70<00:06:53.009> meters<00:06:53.130> but<00:06:53.970> again<00:06:54.509> that's<00:06:55.169> what<00:06:55.410> the<00:06:55.560> x5c

00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:56.310 
70 meters but again that's what the x5c

00:06:56.310 --> 00:06:57.800 
70 meters but again that's what the x5c
does<00:06:56.520> with<00:06:56.699> a<00:06:56.729> camera<00:06:57.090> attached<00:06:57.360> so<00:06:57.599> that's

00:06:57.800 --> 00:06:57.810 
does with a camera attached so that's

00:06:57.810 --> 00:07:00.409 
does with a camera attached so that's
not<00:06:58.229> really<00:06:58.470> a<00:06:58.500> big<00:06:58.620> issue<00:06:59.060> overhead<00:07:00.060> I<00:07:00.090> was

00:07:00.409 --> 00:07:00.419 
not really a big issue overhead I was

00:07:00.419 --> 00:07:01.730 
not really a big issue overhead I was
getting<00:07:00.660> great<00:07:00.750> range<00:07:01.050> overhead<00:07:01.530> I<00:07:01.560> was

00:07:01.730 --> 00:07:01.740 
getting great range overhead I was

00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:04.460 
getting great range overhead I was
getting<00:07:01.949> close<00:07:02.099> to<00:07:02.130> 100<00:07:02.490> meters<00:07:02.729> there<00:07:03.470> about

00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:04.470 
getting close to 100 meters there about

00:07:04.470 --> 00:07:08.390 
getting close to 100 meters there about
300<00:07:04.860> feet<00:07:04.949> up<00:07:05.130> so<00:07:05.930> it<00:07:06.930> can<00:07:07.169> lift<00:07:07.409> this<00:07:07.710> $26

00:07:08.390 --> 00:07:08.400 
300 feet up so it can lift this $26

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:11.210 
300 feet up so it can lift this $26
quadcopter<00:07:09.120> can<00:07:09.360> lift<00:07:09.659> a<00:07:09.930> camera<00:07:10.590> if<00:07:10.800> desired

00:07:11.210 --> 00:07:11.220 
quadcopter can lift a camera if desired

00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:13.790 
quadcopter can lift a camera if desired
an<00:07:12.060> 808<00:07:12.479> keychain<00:07:12.750> camera<00:07:13.110> I<00:07:13.289> wouldn't<00:07:13.620> go<00:07:13.680> any

00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:13.800 
an 808 keychain camera I wouldn't go any

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:15.260 
an 808 keychain camera I wouldn't go any
bigger<00:07:13.979> than<00:07:14.220> this<00:07:14.370> this<00:07:14.610> is<00:07:14.669> about<00:07:15.000> the<00:07:15.150> limit

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:15.270 
bigger than this this is about the limit

00:07:15.270 --> 00:07:17.510 
bigger than this this is about the limit
okay<00:07:16.050> I<00:07:16.259> hope<00:07:16.530> you<00:07:16.800> enjoyed<00:07:17.039> the<00:07:17.159> flight<00:07:17.310> this

00:07:17.510 --> 00:07:17.520 
okay I hope you enjoyed the flight this

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:21.500 
okay I hope you enjoyed the flight this
