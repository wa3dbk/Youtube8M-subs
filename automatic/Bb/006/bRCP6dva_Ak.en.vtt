it down to the ground it's installed new
pin<00:00:46.530> box<00:00:46.739> you'll<00:00:47.309> need<00:00:47.489> a<00:00:47.520> few<00:00:47.730> guys<00:00:47.940> to<00:00:47.969> help

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
pin box you'll need a few guys to help

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.180 
pin box you'll need a few guys to help
hold<00:00:48.600> it<00:00:48.719> up<00:00:48.840> and<00:00:49.050> then<00:00:49.379> put<00:00:49.620> it<00:00:49.680> into<00:00:49.770> place<00:00:50.010> in

hold it up and then put it into place in

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:51.439 
hold it up and then put it into place in
this<00:00:50.309> case<00:00:50.520> we'll<00:00:50.700> be<00:00:50.730> using<00:00:50.910> the<00:00:51.090> 4<00:00:51.270> truck

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
this case we'll be using the 4 truck

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.959 
this case we'll be using the 4 truck
again<00:00:51.800> now<00:00:52.800> there's<00:00:52.980> two<00:00:53.100> settings<00:00:53.520> on<00:00:53.699> height

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
again now there's two settings on height

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:55.910 
again now there's two settings on height
for<00:00:54.210> this<00:00:54.270> pin<00:00:54.629> box<00:00:54.840> it's<00:00:55.350> a<00:00:55.379> good<00:00:55.500> idea<00:00:55.590> to<00:00:55.800> go

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
for this pin box it's a good idea to go

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.500 
for this pin box it's a good idea to go
ahead<00:00:55.949> and<00:00:56.250> measure<00:00:56.430> up<00:00:56.579> the<00:00:56.879> original<00:00:57.059> pin

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
ahead and measure up the original pin

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.209 
ahead and measure up the original pin
box<00:00:57.719> and<00:00:58.050> pair<00:00:58.379> it<00:00:58.410> you<00:00:58.590> to<00:00:58.649> see<00:00:58.770> how<00:00:58.859> close<00:00:59.100> you

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
box and pair it you to see how close you

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:02.150 
box and pair it you to see how close you
can<00:00:59.309> get<00:00:59.489> with<00:00:59.850> the<00:01:00.030> new<00:01:00.180> one<00:01:00.949> we'll<00:01:01.949> go<00:01:02.070> ahead

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
can get with the new one we'll go ahead

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.250 
can get with the new one we'll go ahead
and<00:01:02.250> line<00:01:02.489> up<00:01:02.520> in<00:01:02.760> place<00:01:02.969> fin<00:01:03.600> loosely<00:01:03.989> install
