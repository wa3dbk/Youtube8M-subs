hi<00:00:00.719> my<00:00:01.350> name<00:00:01.530> is<00:00:01.560> Steven<00:00:02.040> McGee<00:00:02.340> and<00:00:02.639> I<00:00:02.879> am<00:00:02.939> the

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:03.120 
hi my name is Steven McGee and I am the

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.590 
hi my name is Steven McGee and I am the
author<00:00:03.360> of<00:00:03.750> toxic<00:00:04.589> electricity<00:00:05.430> now<00:00:06.330> I'm<00:00:06.450> here

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:06.600 
author of toxic electricity now I'm here

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.070 
author of toxic electricity now I'm here
today<00:00:06.779> to<00:00:07.410> measure<00:00:07.980> the<00:00:08.490> radio<00:00:09.150> fields<00:00:09.870> that

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.080 
today to measure the radio fields that

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.980 
today to measure the radio fields that
come<00:00:10.290> out<00:00:10.440> of<00:00:10.469> white<00:00:11.190> bulbs<00:00:11.580> and<00:00:11.730> to<00:00:12.690> do<00:00:12.809> that

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
come out of white bulbs and to do that

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.369 
come out of white bulbs and to do that
we<00:00:13.139> have<00:00:13.259> this<00:00:13.469> radio<00:00:14.370> field<00:00:15.000> meter<00:00:15.540> and<00:00:16.109> this

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
we have this radio field meter and this

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:19.640 
we have this radio field meter and this
will<00:00:16.619> record<00:00:17.070> anything<00:00:17.690> from<00:00:18.690> 10<00:00:19.289> megahertz

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
will record anything from 10 megahertz

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.330 
will record anything from 10 megahertz
through<00:00:20.310> to<00:00:20.580> 8<00:00:20.880> gigahertz<00:00:21.680> so<00:00:22.680> we're<00:00:23.160> going<00:00:23.250> to

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
through to 8 gigahertz so we're going to

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.599 
through to 8 gigahertz so we're going to
start<00:00:23.699> off<00:00:23.880> with<00:00:24.119> our<00:00:24.240> first<00:00:24.570> light<00:00:25.439> bulb<00:00:25.619> this

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
start off with our first light bulb this

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.210 
start off with our first light bulb this
is<00:00:26.789> a<00:00:26.820> conventional<00:00:27.480> 40<00:00:27.930> watt<00:00:28.050> light<00:00:28.230> bulb<00:00:28.439> so

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
is a conventional 40 watt light bulb so

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.350 
is a conventional 40 watt light bulb so
keep<00:00:29.609> an<00:00:29.699> eye<00:00:29.789> on<00:00:29.820> the<00:00:29.970> meter<00:00:30.150> and<00:00:30.439> let's<00:00:31.439> see

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:32.360 
keep an eye on the meter and let's see

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:37.549 
keep an eye on the meter and let's see
how<00:00:33.360> our<00:00:33.780> level<00:00:34.559> changes<00:00:35.420> so<00:00:36.559> there's

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
how our level changes so there's

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:38.930 
how our level changes so there's
actually<00:00:37.680> no<00:00:37.920> doubt<00:00:38.219> that<00:00:38.430> we<00:00:38.489> got<00:00:38.610> a<00:00:38.640> surge

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
actually no doubt that we got a surge

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.440 
actually no doubt that we got a surge
when<00:00:39.480> the<00:00:39.750> light<00:00:40.200> bulb<00:00:40.520> turned<00:00:41.520> on<00:00:41.790> that

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
when the light bulb turned on that

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.110 
when the light bulb turned on that
that's<00:00:42.629> now<00:00:42.809> passed<00:00:43.190> I'm<00:00:44.190> going<00:00:44.370> to<00:00:44.460> back<00:00:44.879> down

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
that's now passed I'm going to back down

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.590 
that's now passed I'm going to back down
to<00:00:45.690> normal<00:00:46.350> levels

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:47.600 
to normal levels

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.810 
to normal levels
so<00:00:48.600> why<00:00:49.110> boards<00:00:49.410> are<00:00:49.710> very<00:00:49.920> very<00:00:50.280> good

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
so why boards are very very good

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.540 
so why boards are very very good
once<00:00:51.420> they've<00:00:51.690> actually<00:00:52.620> passed<00:00:53.280> through

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
once they've actually passed through

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.369 
once they've actually passed through
their<00:00:53.820> initial<00:00:54.149> switch<00:00:54.570> ON<00:00:54.780> process<00:00:56.149> so

00:00:57.369 --> 00:00:57.379 
their initial switch ON process so

00:00:57.379 --> 00:00:59.930 
their initial switch ON process so
that's<00:00:58.379> our<00:00:58.530> conventional<00:00:59.010> filament<00:00:59.520> by<00:00:59.670> bulb

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
that's our conventional filament by bulb

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.280 
that's our conventional filament by bulb
my<00:01:00.210> CV<00:01:00.480> surge<00:01:01.020> again<00:01:01.410> passing<00:01:01.890> through<00:01:02.070> as<00:01:03.290> we

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
my CV surge again passing through as we

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.280 
my CV surge again passing through as we
turn<00:01:04.650> it<00:01:04.769> off<00:01:05.420> so<00:01:06.420> our<00:01:06.540> next<00:01:06.720> light<00:01:06.869> bulb<00:01:07.110> is

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
turn it off so our next light bulb is

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.730 
turn it off so our next light bulb is
going<00:01:07.619> to<00:01:07.740> be<00:01:07.890> this<00:01:08.520> LED<00:01:09.450> light<00:01:09.900> bulb<00:01:10.110> this<00:01:10.380> was

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
going to be this LED light bulb this was

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.130 
going to be this LED light bulb this was
just<00:01:10.950> a<00:01:11.040> random<00:01:11.280> LED<00:01:12.270> light<00:01:12.720> bulb<00:01:12.930> that<00:01:12.990> I

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
just a random LED light bulb that I

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.940 
just a random LED light bulb that I
purchased<00:01:13.799> and<00:01:14.780> let's<00:01:15.780> see<00:01:15.990> what<00:01:16.140> it<00:01:16.259> does<00:01:16.439> so

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
purchased and let's see what it does so

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.630 
purchased and let's see what it does so
Cuba<00:01:17.280> eye<00:01:17.490> on<00:01:18.180> the<00:01:18.270> meter<00:01:18.740> so<00:01:19.740> we<00:01:19.770> saw<00:01:20.250> the

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
Cuba eye on the meter so we saw the

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:26.359 
Cuba eye on the meter so we saw the
level<00:01:20.790> spike<00:01:21.450> at<00:01:21.720> and<00:01:24.320> we<00:01:25.320> continue<00:01:26.040> to<00:01:26.220> watch

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
level spike at and we continue to watch

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:30.980 
level spike at and we continue to watch
it<00:01:26.810> it<00:01:27.810> should<00:01:28.350> hopefully<00:01:29.280> drop<00:01:29.970> down<00:01:30.210> thought

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
it it should hopefully drop down thought

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.179 
it it should hopefully drop down thought
maybe<00:01:31.380> not<00:01:31.650> so<00:01:32.369> let's<00:01:32.549> watch<00:01:32.700> it<00:01:32.939> for<00:01:33.360> maybe<00:01:34.189> 10

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
maybe not so let's watch it for maybe 10

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:36.920 
maybe not so let's watch it for maybe 10
or<00:01:35.220> 20<00:01:35.520> seconds<00:01:35.909> and<00:01:36.270> all<00:01:36.479> the<00:01:36.630> things<00:01:36.720> I

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
or 20 seconds and all the things I

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.899 
or 20 seconds and all the things I
should<00:01:36.960> mention<00:01:37.229> about<00:01:37.560> LED<00:01:38.159> light<00:01:38.400> bulbs<00:01:38.729> is

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
should mention about LED light bulbs is

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:40.899 
should mention about LED light bulbs is
I<00:01:39.210> don't<00:01:39.840> particularly<00:01:40.110> like<00:01:40.350> them<00:01:40.590> because

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:40.909 
I don't particularly like them because

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:43.580 
I don't particularly like them because
generally<00:01:41.909> the<00:01:42.210> majority<00:01:42.299> of<00:01:42.750> them<00:01:42.930> have<00:01:43.110> far

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
generally the majority of them have far

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.010 
generally the majority of them have far
too<00:01:44.070> much<00:01:44.250> blue<00:01:44.700> white<00:01:44.909> in<00:01:45.180> the<00:01:45.689> color

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
too much blue white in the color

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.100 
too much blue white in the color
spectrum<00:01:46.320> an<00:01:47.250> exposure<00:01:48.000> to<00:01:48.149> too<00:01:48.600> much<00:01:48.780> blue

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
spectrum an exposure to too much blue

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.700 
spectrum an exposure to too much blue
light<00:01:49.430> can<00:01:50.430> actually<00:01:51.000> give<00:01:51.329> you<00:01:51.450> insomnia<00:01:52.020> it

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
light can actually give you insomnia it

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.649 
light can actually give you insomnia it
actually<00:01:53.189> causes<00:01:53.490> your<00:01:53.729> body<00:01:53.909> to<00:01:54.060> get<00:01:54.360> quite

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:58.130 
actually causes your body to get quite
confused<00:01:55.110> and<00:01:55.610> his<00:01:56.610> food<00:01:56.850> cycles<00:01:57.270> may<00:01:57.719> go<00:01:57.960> off

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
confused and his food cycles may go off

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.069 
confused and his food cycles may go off
and<00:01:58.439> you<00:01:59.040> may<00:01:59.219> find<00:01:59.729> yourself<00:01:59.850> locked<00:02:00.390> into<00:02:00.659> an

and you may find yourself locked into an

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:03.230 
and you may find yourself locked into an
endless<00:02:01.259> cycle<00:02:01.500> of<00:02:01.710> insomnia<00:02:02.189> so<00:02:03.090> there's

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
endless cycle of insomnia so there's

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:04.700 
endless cycle of insomnia so there's
something<00:02:03.390> to<00:02:03.509> be<00:02:03.600> worried<00:02:04.020> of<00:02:04.229> that<00:02:04.530> it's<00:02:04.680> not

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
something to be worried of that it's not

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.770 
something to be worried of that it's not
some<00:02:05.159> of<00:02:05.250> these<00:02:05.310> LED<00:02:05.670> light<00:02:05.909> bulbs<00:02:06.270> are<00:02:06.540> being

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
some of these LED light bulbs are being

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.889 
some of these LED light bulbs are being
reported<00:02:07.079> to<00:02:07.610> cause<00:02:08.610> insomnia<00:02:09.239> and<00:02:09.599> people

reported to cause insomnia and people

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.660 
reported to cause insomnia and people
messing<00:02:10.709> to<00:02:10.860> see<00:02:11.039> we're<00:02:11.610> actually<00:02:11.730> getting

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:12.670 
messing to see we're actually getting

initially unbeliev olds per meter so

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:21.630 
initially unbeliev olds per meter so
that<00:02:17.800> power<00:02:18.010> level<00:02:18.459> is<00:02:18.700> about<00:02:19.860> 770<00:02:20.860> millivolts

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:21.640 
that power level is about 770 millivolts

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:24.479 
that power level is about 770 millivolts
per<00:02:21.910> meter<00:02:22.150> and<00:02:22.650> it's<00:02:23.650> continuing<00:02:24.250> it's<00:02:24.370> not

00:02:24.479 --> 00:02:24.489 
per meter and it's continuing it's not

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:28.220 
per meter and it's continuing it's not
actually<00:02:24.849> dropping<00:02:25.120> as<00:02:25.830> time<00:02:26.830> goes<00:02:27.069> by<00:02:27.099> so

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
actually dropping as time goes by so

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:32.340 
actually dropping as time goes by so
since<00:02:29.230> we<00:02:29.319> can<00:02:29.470> all<00:02:29.560> feel<00:02:30.069> together<00:02:30.670> these<00:02:31.350> LED

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:32.350 
since we can all feel together these LED

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:35.910 
since we can all feel together these LED
light<00:02:32.830> bulbs<00:02:33.239> so<00:02:34.239> this<00:02:34.690> one<00:02:34.930> we've<00:02:35.110> got<00:02:35.290> this

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
light bulbs so this one we've got this

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.970 
light bulbs so this one we've got this
compact<00:02:36.340> fluorescent<00:02:37.270> light<00:02:37.420> bulb<00:02:37.660> and<00:02:37.980> these

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:38.980 
compact fluorescent light bulb and these

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:40.320 
compact fluorescent light bulb and these
are<00:02:39.130> the<00:02:39.220> curly<00:02:39.459> ones<00:02:39.730> that<00:02:39.940> you<00:02:40.000> see<00:02:40.150> in<00:02:40.239> the

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:40.330 
are the curly ones that you see in the

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:43.470 
are the curly ones that you see in the
shot<00:02:40.830> so<00:02:41.830> let's<00:02:42.280> see<00:02:42.640> what<00:02:42.819> this<00:02:42.910> one<00:02:43.090> does<00:02:43.120> so

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:43.480 
shot so let's see what this one does so

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:45.150 
shot so let's see what this one does so
keep<00:02:43.989> an<00:02:44.080> eye<00:02:44.170> on<00:02:44.200> the<00:02:44.380> meter<00:02:44.560> are<00:02:44.890> actually

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:45.160 
keep an eye on the meter are actually

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:48.840 
keep an eye on the meter are actually
reading<00:02:45.519> 88<00:02:45.970> right<00:02:46.480> now<00:02:46.950> okay<00:02:47.950> just<00:02:48.340> spiked<00:02:48.670> up

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:48.850 
reading 88 right now okay just spiked up

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:53.729 
reading 88 right now okay just spiked up
to<00:02:49.769> 755<00:02:50.769> and<00:02:51.630> with<00:02:52.630> a<00:02:52.660> bit<00:02:52.840> of<00:02:52.930> look<00:02:53.080> as<00:02:53.290> the

00:02:53.729 --> 00:02:53.739 
to 755 and with a bit of look as the

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:56.449 
to 755 and with a bit of look as the
white<00:02:53.890> board<00:02:54.100> warms<00:02:54.459> up<00:02:54.610> that<00:02:55.030> will<00:02:55.209> come<00:02:55.600> down

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:56.459 
white board warms up that will come down

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:59.460 
white board warms up that will come down
so<00:02:57.459> indeed<00:02:58.030> it<00:02:58.299> has<00:02:58.480> come<00:02:58.720> down<00:02:58.750> and<00:02:59.200> we're<00:02:59.350> now

00:02:59.460 --> 00:02:59.470 
so indeed it has come down and we're now

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:04.229 
so indeed it has come down and we're now
back<00:03:00.040> at<00:03:00.370> our<00:03:01.000> normal<00:03:01.600> levels<00:03:01.959> and<00:03:02.970> it<00:03:03.970> seems

00:03:04.229 --> 00:03:04.239 
back at our normal levels and it seems

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:07.789 
back at our normal levels and it seems
to<00:03:04.330> be<00:03:04.420> somewhat<00:03:04.989> better<00:03:05.140> the<00:03:05.880> LED<00:03:06.880> light<00:03:07.330> bulb

00:03:07.789 --> 00:03:07.799 
to be somewhat better the LED light bulb

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:11.600 
to be somewhat better the LED light bulb
so<00:03:08.799> I'm<00:03:09.610> going<00:03:09.790> to<00:03:09.850> take<00:03:10.030> this<00:03:10.150> one<00:03:10.360> out<00:03:10.390> and

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:11.610 
so I'm going to take this one out and

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:13.320 
so I'm going to take this one out and
try<00:03:12.610> the<00:03:12.670> next<00:03:12.880> one

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:13.330 
try the next one

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:15.059 
try the next one
so<00:03:13.630> we<00:03:13.720> sort<00:03:13.900> of<00:03:13.959> spiked<00:03:14.290> up<00:03:14.470> again<00:03:14.709> and<00:03:14.920> it

00:03:15.059 --> 00:03:15.069 
so we sort of spiked up again and it

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:19.170 
so we sort of spiked up again and it
disconnected<00:03:15.640> from<00:03:16.030> the<00:03:16.180> system<00:03:16.540> so<00:03:18.030> this<00:03:19.030> is

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:19.180 
disconnected from the system so this is

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:22.229 
disconnected from the system so this is
our<00:03:19.299> last<00:03:19.510> light<00:03:19.750> bulb<00:03:19.959> and<00:03:20.400> the<00:03:21.400> thing<00:03:22.060> about

00:03:22.229 --> 00:03:22.239 
our last light bulb and the thing about

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:23.970 
our last light bulb and the thing about
this<00:03:22.390> one<00:03:22.450> is<00:03:22.720> it<00:03:22.870> so<00:03:23.140> much<00:03:23.230> more<00:03:23.440> powerful

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:23.980 
this one is it so much more powerful

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:26.550 
this one is it so much more powerful
light<00:03:24.130> bulbs<00:03:24.459> much<00:03:24.670> larger<00:03:25.150> and<00:03:25.560> more

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:26.560 
light bulbs much larger and more

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:29.009 
light bulbs much larger and more
importantly<00:03:26.980> it's<00:03:27.250> very<00:03:27.549> very<00:03:27.940> old<00:03:28.180> so<00:03:28.810> let's

00:03:29.009 --> 00:03:29.019 
importantly it's very very old so let's

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:31.590 
importantly it's very very old so let's
see<00:03:29.170> what<00:03:29.320> I<00:03:29.350> very<00:03:30.010> old<00:03:30.340> compact<00:03:30.940> fluorescent

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:31.600 
see what I very old compact fluorescent

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:33.569 
see what I very old compact fluorescent
light<00:03:31.750> bulb<00:03:31.959> does<00:03:32.170> with<00:03:33.040> radiofrequency

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:33.579 
light bulb does with radiofrequency

00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:40.560 
light bulb does with radiofrequency
radiation<00:03:35.730> so<00:03:36.730> watch<00:03:36.850> the<00:03:37.030> meter<00:03:39.209> okay

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:40.570 
radiation so watch the meter okay

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:44.280 
radiation so watch the meter okay
so<00:03:41.260> we've<00:03:41.709> turned<00:03:41.920> on<00:03:42.190> and<00:03:42.519> we're<00:03:42.700> at<00:03:43.290> 760

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:44.290 
so we've turned on and we're at 760

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:47.460 
so we've turned on and we're at 760
approximately<00:03:45.190> for<00:03:46.120> our<00:03:46.299> radio<00:03:46.630> frequency

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:47.470 
approximately for our radio frequency

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:50.220 
approximately for our radio frequency
radiation<00:03:47.940> and<00:03:48.940> that's<00:03:49.329> now<00:03:49.570> rapidly

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:50.230 
radiation and that's now rapidly

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:53.970 
radiation and that's now rapidly
dropping<00:03:50.799> down<00:03:51.570> so<00:03:52.570> there's<00:03:53.079> something<00:03:53.290> about

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:53.980 
dropping down so there's something about

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:58.410 
dropping down so there's something about
the<00:03:54.670> LED<00:03:55.239> light<00:03:55.750> bulb<00:03:55.989> that<00:03:56.700> it<00:03:57.700> continually

00:03:58.410 --> 00:03:58.420 
the LED light bulb that it continually

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:01.319 
the LED light bulb that it continually
puts<00:03:58.810> out<00:03:59.019> a<00:03:59.260> lot<00:03:59.319> of<00:03:59.890> radio<00:04:00.640> frequency<00:04:01.180> energy

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:01.329 
puts out a lot of radio frequency energy

00:04:01.329 --> 00:04:05.729 
puts out a lot of radio frequency energy
that<00:04:01.810> can<00:04:01.930> be<00:04:02.019> picked<00:04:02.380> up<00:04:02.530> by<00:04:02.970> the<00:04:03.970> RF<00:04:04.390> meter<00:04:04.840> so

00:04:05.729 --> 00:04:05.739 
that can be picked up by the RF meter so

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:08.750 
that can be picked up by the RF meter so
let's<00:04:05.920> go<00:04:06.069> back<00:04:06.310> to<00:04:06.819> the<00:04:06.940> LED<00:04:07.420> light<00:04:07.660> bulb<00:04:07.900> and

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:08.760 
let's go back to the LED light bulb and

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:16.509 
let's go back to the LED light bulb and
check<00:04:09.760> it<00:04:09.880> out

00:04:16.509 --> 00:04:16.519 

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:18.249 

so<00:04:17.120> we're<00:04:17.269> going<00:04:17.389> to<00:04:17.449> put<00:04:17.569> it<00:04:17.660> back<00:04:17.780> here<00:04:18.019> and

00:04:18.249 --> 00:04:18.259 
so we're going to put it back here and

00:04:18.259 --> 00:04:19.509 
so we're going to put it back here and
we<00:04:18.380> should<00:04:18.440> see<00:04:18.709> it<00:04:18.799> spike<00:04:19.069> here<00:04:19.280> and

00:04:19.509 --> 00:04:19.519 
we should see it spike here and

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:23.860 
we should see it spike here and
hopefully<00:04:19.880> go<00:04:20.840> back<00:04:21.049> down<00:04:21.759> but<00:04:22.870> unfortunately

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:23.870 
hopefully go back down but unfortunately

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:25.870 
hopefully go back down but unfortunately
I<00:04:24.349> think<00:04:24.590> this<00:04:24.680> particular<00:04:24.889> LED<00:04:25.460> light<00:04:25.639> bulb

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:25.880 
I think this particular LED light bulb

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:28.270 
I think this particular LED light bulb
actually<00:04:26.630> gives<00:04:27.319> out<00:04:27.470> a<00:04:27.680> lot<00:04:27.860> of<00:04:27.949> radio

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:28.280 
actually gives out a lot of radio

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:30.999 
actually gives out a lot of radio
frequency<00:04:28.819> and<00:04:29.169> that's<00:04:30.169> just<00:04:30.380> a<00:04:30.470> feature<00:04:30.620> of

00:04:30.999 --> 00:04:31.009 
frequency and that's just a feature of

00:04:31.009 --> 00:04:33.029 
frequency and that's just a feature of
this<00:04:31.160> particular<00:04:31.430> light<00:04:31.759> bulb<00:04:31.970> so

00:04:33.029 --> 00:04:33.039 
this particular light bulb so

00:04:33.039 --> 00:04:34.960 
this particular light bulb so
unfortunately<00:04:34.039> you<00:04:34.220> know<00:04:34.340> I<00:04:34.370> don't<00:04:34.940> actually

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:34.970 
unfortunately you know I don't actually

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:37.240 
unfortunately you know I don't actually
recommend<00:04:35.330> that<00:04:35.660> people<00:04:35.870> buy<00:04:36.410> these<00:04:36.470> LED

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:37.250 
recommend that people buy these LED

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:39.279 
recommend that people buy these LED
light<00:04:37.639> bulbs<00:04:38.000> because<00:04:38.150> there's<00:04:38.930> so<00:04:39.169> many

00:04:39.279 --> 00:04:39.289 
light bulbs because there's so many

00:04:39.289 --> 00:04:41.740 
light bulbs because there's so many
problems<00:04:40.099> showing<00:04:40.699> over<00:04:40.970> them<00:04:41.180> and<00:04:41.419> there's

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:41.750 
problems showing over them and there's
