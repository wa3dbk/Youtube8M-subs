or something like that to jump off of
it's<00:00:22.470> really<00:00:22.710> helpful<00:00:22.949> to<00:00:23.189> have<00:00:23.250> a<00:00:23.310> front<00:00:23.640> flip

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730

before<00:00:23.970> you<00:00:24.180> learn<00:00:24.330> a<00:00:24.359> web<00:00:24.600> server<00:00:24.840> because

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
before you learn a web server because

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:26.689 
before you learn a web server because
the<00:00:25.199> Western<00:00:25.529> is<00:00:25.590> a<00:00:25.650> lot<00:00:25.800> more<00:00:25.949> technical<00:00:26.310> and

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
the Western is a lot more technical and

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:30.019 
the Western is a lot more technical and
much<00:00:27.000> harder<00:00:27.420> than<00:00:27.869> a<00:00:27.930> normal<00:00:28.320> front<00:00:28.529> flip<00:00:29.029> so

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
much harder than a normal front flip so

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:31.519 
much harder than a normal front flip so
before<00:00:30.390> you<00:00:30.539> do<00:00:30.660> the<00:00:30.779> wetsuit<00:00:31.170> you'll<00:00:31.320> want<00:00:31.470> to

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
before you do the wetsuit you'll want to

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.799 
before you do the wetsuit you'll want to
know<00:00:31.679> which<00:00:31.890> side<00:00:32.160> you<00:00:32.309> do<00:00:32.460> it<00:00:32.579> on<00:00:32.809> personally

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
know which side you do it on personally

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.410 
know which side you do it on personally
I<00:00:33.840> do<00:00:34.079> it<00:00:34.380> with<00:00:34.530> my<00:00:34.739> left<00:00:34.950> leg<00:00:35.130> forwards<00:00:35.790> so

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
I do it with my left leg forwards so

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.510 
I do it with my left leg forwards so
before<00:00:36.809> you<00:00:36.960> do<00:00:37.140> it<00:00:37.290> make<00:00:37.920> sure<00:00:37.950> you<00:00:38.219> stretch

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
before you do it make sure you stretch

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.260 
before you do it make sure you stretch
this<00:00:39.120> split<00:00:39.719> on<00:00:39.960> this<00:00:40.230> side<00:00:40.610> before<00:00:41.610> you<00:00:42.059> try

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
this split on this side before you try

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.600 
this split on this side before you try
the<00:00:42.329> Webster<00:00:42.920> so<00:00:43.920> the<00:00:44.010> reason<00:00:44.309> you<00:00:44.340> stretch

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
the Webster so the reason you stretch

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.790 
the Webster so the reason you stretch
your<00:00:44.760> splits<00:00:45.030> is<00:00:45.270> because<00:00:45.960> if<00:00:46.230> you're<00:00:46.410> able<00:00:46.530> to

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
your splits is because if you're able to

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.770 
your splits is because if you're able to
do<00:00:46.980> them<00:00:47.160> then<00:00:47.370> you<00:00:47.489> can<00:00:47.670> get<00:00:47.879> your<00:00:48.000> leg<00:00:48.180> way<00:00:48.600> up

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
do them then you can get your leg way up

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.260 
do them then you can get your leg way up
here<00:00:49.140> and<00:00:49.320> you<00:00:49.739> only<00:00:49.890> have<00:00:50.219> to<00:00:50.370> do<00:00:50.460> half<00:00:50.489> a<00:00:50.820> flip

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
here and you only have to do half a flip

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.020 
here and you only have to do half a flip
till<00:00:51.870> that<00:00:52.170> leg<00:00:52.440> reaches<00:00:52.860> the<00:00:52.980> ground<00:00:53.160> because

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
till that leg reaches the ground because

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.760 
till that leg reaches the ground because
you<00:00:54.180> can<00:00:54.329> land<00:00:54.480> split<00:00:54.780> put<00:00:55.050> it<00:00:55.170> on<00:00:55.320> the<00:00:55.410> Webster

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
you can land split put it on the Webster

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
your arms some people like to reach them

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.850 
your arms some people like to reach them
up<00:01:23.369> like<00:01:23.640> this<00:01:23.960> some<00:01:24.960> people<00:01:25.320> like<00:01:25.500> to<00:01:25.530> do<00:01:25.830> a

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
up like this some people like to do a

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.859 
up like this some people like to do a
Russian<00:01:26.220> stop<00:01:26.670> and<00:01:26.880> throw<00:01:27.090> them<00:01:27.299> backwards

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
Russian stop and throw them backwards

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:31.219 
Russian stop and throw them backwards
and<00:01:28.140> some<00:01:28.920> people<00:01:29.310> I<00:01:29.579> see<00:01:30.509> a<00:01:30.540> lot<00:01:30.750> of<00:01:30.780> triggers

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
and some people I see a lot of triggers

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:35.289 
and some people I see a lot of triggers
try<00:01:31.500> this<00:01:31.560> but<00:01:32.009> they<00:01:32.189> do<00:01:32.820> a<00:01:33.170> split<00:01:34.170> like<00:01:34.380> that<00:01:34.409> I

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:35.299 
try this but they do a split like that I

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:37.340 
try this but they do a split like that I
personally<00:01:36.299> will<00:01:36.479> show<00:01:36.659> you<00:01:36.780> with<00:01:36.960> the<00:01:37.079> arms

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
personally will show you with the arms

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.219 
personally will show you with the arms
backwards<00:01:37.920> and<00:01:38.220> I'm<00:01:38.369> gonna<00:01:38.490> tell<00:01:38.759> you<00:01:38.790> why<00:01:39.229> the

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
backwards and I'm gonna tell you why the

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:41.840 
backwards and I'm gonna tell you why the
reason<00:01:40.259> I<00:01:40.560> throw<00:01:40.740> my<00:01:40.890> arms<00:01:41.100> backwards<00:01:41.640> is

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
reason I throw my arms backwards is

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.359 
reason I throw my arms backwards is
because<00:01:42.270> I'm<00:01:42.689> turning<00:01:43.200> my<00:01:43.409> fourth<00:01:43.799> momentum

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
because I'm turning my fourth momentum

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:47.030 
because I'm turning my fourth momentum
in<00:01:44.759> to<00:01:45.240> hide<00:01:45.479> by<00:01:45.720> shooting<00:01:46.140> them<00:01:46.320> like<00:01:46.500> this<00:01:46.740> so

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
in to hide by shooting them like this so

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.389 
in to hide by shooting them like this so
it's<00:01:47.909> treating<00:01:48.390> a<00:01:48.509> blocking<00:01:49.200> motion<00:01:50.009> because

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
it's treating a blocking motion because

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:51.800 
it's treating a blocking motion because
you<00:01:50.490> can't<00:01:50.729> block<00:01:51.000> with<00:01:51.270> your<00:01:51.420> body

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
you can't block with your body

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.679 
you can't block with your body
since<00:01:52.439> you're<00:01:52.590> jumping<00:01:52.950> off<00:01:53.130> of<00:01:53.159> one<00:01:53.490> leg<00:01:53.689> so

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
since you're jumping off of one leg so

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:56.270 
since you're jumping off of one leg so
instead<00:01:54.960> of<00:01:55.020> blocking<00:01:55.290> with<00:01:55.649> your<00:01:55.799> body<00:01:56.009> like

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
instead of blocking with your body like

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:57.260 
instead of blocking with your body like
you<00:01:56.399> would<00:01:56.579> for<00:01:56.759> a<00:01:56.790> front<00:01:57.030> flip

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
you would for a front flip

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.660 
you would for a front flip
you're<00:01:57.689> blocking<00:01:58.200> with<00:01:58.409> your<00:01:58.560> arms<00:01:59.040> and<00:01:59.250> since

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
you're blocking with your arms and since

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.969 
you're blocking with your arms and since
they<00:01:59.880> stop<00:02:00.210> just<00:02:00.540> here<00:02:00.930> they're<00:02:01.380> actually

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
they stop just here they're actually

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.940 
they stop just here they're actually

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:10.350 
see you in that motion so you want to

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:13.070 
see you in that motion so you want to
practice<00:02:10.530> that<00:02:10.740> a<00:02:10.890> few<00:02:10.979> times<00:02:11.340> while<00:02:12.080> swinging

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
practice that a few times while swinging

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.040 
practice that a few times while swinging
your<00:02:13.200> arms<00:02:13.470> backwards<00:02:13.980> like<00:02:14.069> this<00:02:14.870> you<00:02:15.870> want

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
your arms backwards like this you want

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:17.530 
your arms backwards like this you want
to<00:02:16.110> make<00:02:16.230> sure<00:02:16.260> that<00:02:16.530> you<00:02:16.680> kick<00:02:17.040> your<00:02:17.190> leg

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540 
to make sure that you kick your leg

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:20.990 
to make sure that you kick your leg
backwards<00:02:18.540> as<00:02:18.750> hard<00:02:19.680> as<00:02:19.830> you<00:02:19.950> can<00:02:20.220> while

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
backwards as hard as you can while

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.760 
backwards as hard as you can while
swinging<00:02:21.330> your<00:02:21.600> arms<00:02:21.900> all<00:02:22.140> at<00:02:22.440> the<00:02:22.560> same<00:02:22.740> time

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:24.770 
swinging your arms all at the same time

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:27.560 
swinging your arms all at the same time
if<00:02:25.770> you<00:02:26.040> throw<00:02:26.490> them<00:02:26.610> all<00:02:26.880> at<00:02:27.030> the<00:02:27.150> same<00:02:27.360> time

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:27.570 
if you throw them all at the same time

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:29.180 
if you throw them all at the same time
then<00:02:27.840> you'll<00:02:27.990> have<00:02:28.110> that<00:02:28.380> much<00:02:28.440> more<00:02:28.620> power

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
then you'll have that much more power

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:31.100 
then you'll have that much more power
because<00:02:29.820> they're<00:02:30.209> not<00:02:30.330> separated<00:02:30.959> they're

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
because they're not separated they're

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:32.900 
because they're not separated they're
all<00:02:31.200> together<00:02:31.440> throwing<00:02:32.190> your<00:02:32.340> body<00:02:32.550> and

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
flipping it at the same time so you keep

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.530 
flipping it at the same time so you keep
your<00:02:36.180> back<00:02:36.780> leg<00:02:36.810> as<00:02:37.410> hard<00:02:38.310> as<00:02:38.430> you<00:02:38.520> can<00:02:38.819> over

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540

and<00:02:39.870> throw<00:02:40.830> your<00:02:40.920> arms<00:02:41.190> like<00:02:41.310> this<00:02:42.709> you<00:02:43.709> also

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 
and throw your arms like this you also

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:45.380 
and throw your arms like this you also
want<00:02:44.130> to<00:02:44.160> make<00:02:44.310> sure<00:02:44.520> that<00:02:44.820> when<00:02:45.030> you<00:02:45.150> put<00:02:45.360> your

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
front leg on the obstacle that is not

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:50.420 
front leg on the obstacle that is not
fully<00:02:48.030> straight<00:02:48.450> you<00:02:49.080> want<00:02:49.290> it<00:02:49.440> slightly<00:02:49.890> bent

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
fully straight you want it slightly bent

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:53.240 
fully straight you want it slightly bent
like<00:02:50.970> this<00:02:51.239> so<00:02:51.810> you<00:02:51.900> can<00:02:52.110> get<00:02:52.320> tight<00:02:52.680> by

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
like this so you can get tight by

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:56.710 
like this so you can get tight by
straightening<00:02:53.970> it<00:02:54.180> and<00:02:54.209> jumping<00:02:54.900> off<00:02:55.140> of<00:02:55.170> it

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:56.720 
straightening it and jumping off of it

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:59.509 
straightening it and jumping off of it
so<00:02:57.720> when<00:02:57.870> I<00:02:57.900> do<00:02:58.019> it<00:02:58.350> so<00:02:58.560> I<00:02:58.590> do<00:02:58.709> something<00:02:59.220> that<00:02:59.250> I

00:02:59.509 --> 00:02:59.519 
so when I do it so I do something that I

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:01.520 
so when I do it so I do something that I
call<00:02:59.760> it<00:02:59.790> a<00:02:59.970> dip<00:03:00.300> so<00:03:00.959> I'm<00:03:01.080> gonna<00:03:01.230> bring<00:03:01.470> my

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220 
chest down and then bring it back up as

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:08.330 
chest down and then bring it back up as
I'm<00:03:05.850> jumping<00:03:06.500> look<00:03:07.500> at<00:03:07.620> my<00:03:07.739> chest<00:03:08.040> when<00:03:08.250> I

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
I'm jumping look at my chest when I

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:12.979 
I'm jumping look at my chest when I
practice<00:03:08.970> it<00:03:11.420> so<00:03:12.420> then<00:03:12.570> when<00:03:12.750> you're<00:03:12.870> at<00:03:12.959> that

00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:12.989

so you're gonna kick that back leg as
hard<00:03:16.950> as<00:03:17.070> possible<00:03:17.310> and<00:03:17.820> it's<00:03:18.360> going<00:03:18.540> to<00:03:18.630> be

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720 
hard as possible and it's going to be

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:21.830 
hard as possible and it's going to be
the<00:03:18.840> first<00:03:19.170> limb<00:03:20.040> to<00:03:20.310> focus<00:03:20.670> the<00:03:20.820> ground<00:03:21.090> so

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
the first limb to focus the ground so

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:23.810 
the first limb to focus the ground so
your<00:03:21.959> back<00:03:22.170> leg<00:03:22.470> is<00:03:22.500> going<00:03:22.620> to<00:03:22.829> come<00:03:23.070> over<00:03:23.370> and

00:03:26.509 --> 00:03:26.519 
you're gonna land the flip split footed

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:30.080 
you're gonna land the flip split footed
like<00:03:27.120> this<00:03:28.160> so<00:03:29.160> it's<00:03:29.280> gonna<00:03:29.400> feel<00:03:29.640> a<00:03:29.670> lot<00:03:29.910> like

like this so it's gonna feel a lot like
a<00:03:30.120> front<00:03:30.480> flip<00:03:30.600> but<00:03:30.930> instead<00:03:31.200> of<00:03:31.350> bringing

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560 
a front flip but instead of bringing

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:33.710 
a front flip but instead of bringing
your<00:03:31.950> feet<00:03:32.130> together<00:03:32.340> like<00:03:32.790> this<00:03:33.030> you're

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:33.720 
your feet together like this you're

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:35.479 
your feet together like this you're
gonna<00:03:33.810> lend<00:03:34.110> them<00:03:34.350> one<00:03:34.650> at<00:03:34.799> a<00:03:34.829> time

00:03:35.479 --> 00:03:35.489 
gonna lend them one at a time

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:37.880 
gonna lend them one at a time
split<00:03:36.180> footed<00:03:36.630> it's<00:03:37.290> gonna<00:03:37.440> take<00:03:37.650> a<00:03:37.680> lot<00:03:37.860> of

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:37.890 
split footed it's gonna take a lot of

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:40.910 
split footed it's gonna take a lot of
practice<00:03:38.160> to<00:03:39.090> try<00:03:39.360> and<00:03:39.480> land<00:03:39.630> on<00:03:39.930> one<00:03:40.260> foot<00:03:40.620> at

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:40.920 
practice to try and land on one foot at

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:43.490 
practice to try and land on one foot at
a<00:03:41.130> time<00:03:41.250> but<00:03:42.209> the<00:03:42.690> more<00:03:42.840> you<00:03:42.959> practice<00:03:43.140> it<00:03:43.440> the

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:43.500 
a time but the more you practice it the

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:46.280 
a time but the more you practice it the
easier<00:03:43.920> will<00:03:44.010> become<00:03:44.870> there's<00:03:45.870> also<00:03:46.019> a<00:03:46.140> little

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:46.290 
easier will become there's also a little

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:47.210 
easier will become there's also a little
trick<00:03:46.530> that<00:03:46.560> you're<00:03:46.739> gonna<00:03:46.829> see<00:03:47.040> a<00:03:47.070> lot<00:03:47.190> of

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:47.220 
trick that you're gonna see a lot of

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:50.569 
trick that you're gonna see a lot of
parkour<00:03:47.670> guys<00:03:47.880> doing<00:03:48.239> what<00:03:48.930> they<00:03:49.110> do<00:03:49.170> is<00:03:49.709> after

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:50.579 
parkour guys doing what they do is after

00:03:50.579 --> 00:03:53.660 
parkour guys doing what they do is after
you<00:03:50.760> leave<00:03:50.970> the<00:03:51.150> ground<00:03:51.350> they<00:03:52.350> actually<00:03:53.040> grab

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:53.670 
you leave the ground they actually grab

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:56.330 
you leave the ground they actually grab
the<00:03:54.030> front<00:03:54.420> leg<00:03:54.660> and<00:03:54.900> that<00:03:55.230> simulates<00:03:55.769> a<00:03:56.070> ton

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:56.340 
the front leg and that simulates a ton

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:59.690 
the front leg and that simulates a ton
