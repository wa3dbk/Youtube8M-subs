 movement is like moving around in 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:17.280

 how are you going to do that because at 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:33.750
 Sometimes you make it No one is more 

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:36.030
 difficult because there are people 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:37.710
 difficulty to play and move 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:40.950
 a little to do tatá and if 

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:44.700
 move and recharge understood 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:51.930
 complicated the technique I use in 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:57.470
 6 2 on a boy scale lying on a 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:04:03.150

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:18.720
 plus the gameplay generally understood 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:23.340
 choose easier and is the enem is a 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:25.710
 common class is and I try to bring 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:29.610
 you can not play super and not come 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:33.270

 12 and more powerful and will charge for 

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:46.010

 take a look at the latest videos 

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:09.689
 I think that afterwards there is interest, it just gives a 

00:05:06.949 --> 00:05:15.229
 There you have a rival 

00:05:09.689 --> 00:05:20.129
 inside like it kills a guy that way 

00:05:15.229 --> 00:05:23.189
 we go there though that this part here 

00:05:20.129 --> 00:05:24.719
 melo protection is the playing naked 

00:05:23.189 --> 00:05:29.039
 that I took from a 

00:05:24.719 --> 00:05:30.990

00:05:29.039 --> 00:05:33.210
 new here on the channel that the gal liked 

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:36.599
 enough is already asking for the weapon is that 

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:38.340
 wants to play in the naked and playing naked is 

00:05:36.599 --> 00:05:46.500
