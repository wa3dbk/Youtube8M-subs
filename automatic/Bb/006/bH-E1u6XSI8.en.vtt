00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:23.690 
anyway I think hidden things that a

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:25.960 
anyway I think hidden things that a
rolling<00:02:24.019> pin<00:02:24.260> is<00:02:24.830> much<00:02:25.100> richer<00:02:25.430> atomic

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:25.970 
rolling pin is much richer atomic

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:32.140 
rolling pin is much richer atomic
potential<00:02:29.500> these<00:02:30.500> really<00:02:30.980> only<00:02:31.250> need<00:02:31.640> a

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.150 
potential these really only need a

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:34.030 
potential these really only need a
couple<00:02:32.450> of<00:02:32.690> minutes<00:02:32.959> each<00:02:33.080> side<00:02:33.410> just<00:02:33.440> so

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:34.040 
couple of minutes each side just so

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:36.070 
couple of minutes each side just so
they're<00:02:34.220> crispy<00:02:34.760> crunchy<00:02:35.540> coating<00:02:35.750> those

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:36.080 
they're crispy crunchy coating those

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:38.770 
they're crispy crunchy coating those
golden<00:02:36.590> and<00:02:36.920> for<00:02:37.760> that<00:02:37.880> reason<00:02:37.940> they<00:02:38.420> should

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:38.780 
golden and for that reason they should

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:40.060 
golden and for that reason they should
really<00:02:38.989> be<00:02:39.170> at<00:02:39.260> room<00:02:39.410> temperature<00:02:39.920> before
