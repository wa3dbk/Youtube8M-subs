00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:04.260
 one of the most durable earth fireplace 

00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:06.000
 This if time material modern 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.850
 interior designers 

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:09.330
 five building material he 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.200
 durable elegant and steadily acidic 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:15.200
 rains 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.850
 natural granite factory located on 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:22.859
 several kilometers deep 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:24.980
 molten rock magna under 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:26.329
 pressure rises through 

00:00:26.329 --> 00:00:28.119
 cracks and cracks in the earth's crust 

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:29.949
 as she rises she 

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:30.849
 rips off 

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:33.849
 and turns into faces 

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:45.880
 basically borders or r 

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:47.510
 water with ordinary rocks that 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:49.690
 make up most of the earth 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:52.690
 surface 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:56.280
 first get out 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.989
 part of a granite stele with a length of 30 and a width of 7 

00:00:58.989 --> 00:00:59.560
 meters 

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:01.320
 then burning with a gas torch 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.490
 long narrow grooves to delineate what 

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:05.590
 earlier on the perimeter of the cup are fighting 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:08.590
 holes depth and further they are dead 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.610
 then there is a typo 

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:30.310
 blast freeing rock 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:32.369
 using drills metropolitan clinics 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.720
 slave granite blocks size three on 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:36.220
 one and a half meters 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:37.560
 this size is optimal for 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.560
 most granite jawad 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:52.740
 although the blocks seem small each 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.740
 weigh at least twenty tons 

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:04.510
 The first stage of work in the factory sharply blocks 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:07.030
 to allow circles too five 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:09.169
 six meters apply it 

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:11.099
 working surface of the body and consists of 

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:12.869
 metal segment particles 

00:02:12.869 --> 00:02:14.439
 artificial diamonds that allows 

00:02:14.439 --> 00:02:16.839
 achieve the desired friction for cutting 

00:02:16.839 --> 00:02:18.949
 water not letting the surface of the feast 

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:19.729
 Greece 

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:21.450
 it's very slow past 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:23.739
 saw permits less than two square

00:02:27.139 --> 00:02:28.879
 for cutting a cat taller than five centimeters 

00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:31.609
 using his sixth place is not enough 

00:02:31.609 --> 00:02:33.539
 durable so as not to break through in the process 

00:02:33.539 --> 00:02:34.189
 small river 

00:02:34.189 --> 00:02:36.040
 thin enough to go as you can 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:37.359
 more precisely 

00:02:37.359 --> 00:02:39.839
 this saw cuts 8 square meters 

00:02:39.839 --> 00:02:42.629
 commercial in sections of the unit requires 6 

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:45.629
 up to 3 rubles 

00:02:58.079 --> 00:03:00.500
 stage loco discharged plate and 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:02.489
 but found the ass 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:05.489
 this process brings out the beauty of Ukraine 

00:03:07.369 --> 00:03:10.169
 bucket machine exulted 19 heads for each of 

00:03:10.169 --> 00:03:13.169
 which are 9 abrasive alimony 

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:18.519
 cars come in square meters 

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:20.179
 stones per minute 

00:03:20.179 --> 00:03:22.229
 for maximum bald block passes 

00:03:22.229 --> 00:03:24.149
 through the middle of our heads a for 

00:03:24.149 --> 00:03:27.149
 average only through the first 10 

00:03:36.789 --> 00:03:39.099
 and if you need a coffin polishing finish 

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:40.679
 replaces scoop 

00:03:40.679 --> 00:03:42.279
 surface rocks are processed 

00:03:42.279 --> 00:03:44.129
 flame gas burners and 

00:03:44.129 --> 00:03:46.069
 at the same time watered 

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:49.069
 avoid cracks 

00:03:56.499 --> 00:03:57.899
 now heat up 

00:03:57.899 --> 00:04:00.089
 examining a blasting check and 

00:04:00.089 --> 00:04:01.719
 becomes rough 

00:04:01.719 --> 00:04:03.269
 such granite is used when 

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:04.819
 making a little tougher 

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:07.819
 floors 

00:04:09.549 --> 00:04:11.790
 after finishing and while giving shape 

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:14.790
 depending on the destination 

00:04:31.699 --> 00:04:33.590
 granite substances 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:35.370
 give it a presentation and famous 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:37.740
 strength why granite will always be 

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:40.809
 the embodiment of style and durability
