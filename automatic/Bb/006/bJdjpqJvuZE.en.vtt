00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:07.280 
meaning to do this for a while but
you're<00:00:06.450> basically<00:00:06.720> going<00:00:06.870> to<00:00:06.930> want<00:00:07.080> to<00:00:07.140> set<00:00:07.259> a

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:07.290 
you're basically going to want to set a

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:09.830 
you're basically going to want to set a
waypoint<00:00:07.470> at<00:00:07.950> where<00:00:08.250> I<00:00:08.570> just<00:00:09.570> said<00:00:09.719> it

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:09.840 
waypoint at where I just said it

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.070 
waypoint at where I just said it
somewhere<00:00:10.620> around<00:00:10.679> there<00:00:10.920> it's<00:00:11.070> to<00:00:11.250> the<00:00:11.400> west

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:12.080 
somewhere around there it's to the west

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:15.499 
somewhere around there it's to the west
of<00:00:13.080> the<00:00:13.139> city<00:00:14.059> you're<00:00:15.059> going<00:00:15.179> to<00:00:15.240> hop<00:00:15.330> in<00:00:15.450> a

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
of the city you're going to hop in a

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:18.320 
of the city you're going to hop in a
boat<00:00:15.660> and<00:00:15.809> drive<00:00:16.170> over<00:00:16.910> the<00:00:17.910> a<00:00:17.940> drive<00:00:18.240> out

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
boat and drive over the a drive out

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:26.839 
boat and drive over the a drive out
there<00:00:18.449> I<00:00:18.510> guess<00:00:20.990> vroom<00:00:23.840> and<00:00:25.369> then<00:00:26.369> if<00:00:26.580> you<00:00:26.699> want

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
there I guess vroom and then if you want

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:28.550 
there I guess vroom and then if you want
you<00:00:26.910> can<00:00:27.029> try<00:00:27.420> to<00:00:27.480> do<00:00:27.660> a<00:00:27.689> ramp<00:00:27.930> like<00:00:28.080> I<00:00:28.260> did<00:00:28.439> but

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
you can try to do a ramp like I did but

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.580 
you can try to do a ramp like I did but
I<00:00:28.619> failed<00:00:29.039> horribly<00:00:30.170> just<00:00:31.170> pretty<00:00:31.410> rude

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
I failed horribly just pretty rude

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.110 
I failed horribly just pretty rude
because<00:00:31.710> I<00:00:31.859> figured<00:00:31.920> this<00:00:32.219> route<00:00:32.399> would<00:00:33.059> take

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
because I figured this route would take

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.229 
because I figured this route would take
a<00:00:33.270> ramp<00:00:33.930> nicely<00:00:34.380> but<00:00:34.530> i<00:00:34.559> guess<00:00:34.710> not<00:00:35.239> anyways

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
a ramp nicely but i guess not anyways

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:39.380 
a ramp nicely but i guess not anyways
keep<00:00:36.450> driving<00:00:36.719> out<00:00:36.809> there<00:00:37.910> it's<00:00:38.910> not<00:00:39.000> exactly

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
keep driving out there it's not exactly

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:40.490 
keep driving out there it's not exactly
where<00:00:39.600> I<00:00:39.660> SAT<00:00:39.719> the<00:00:39.899> way<00:00:39.989> point<00:00:40.260> but<00:00:40.379> it's

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
where I SAT the way point but it's

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:47.930 
where I SAT the way point but it's
around<00:00:40.800> that<00:00:40.950> area<00:00:41.250> oh<00:00:43.160> yeah<00:00:44.160> oh<00:00:46.760> my<00:00:47.760> always

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
around that area oh yeah oh my always

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.209 
around that area oh yeah oh my always
now<00:00:48.719> you<00:00:48.780> can<00:00:48.960> see<00:00:49.200> it<00:00:49.289> often<00:00:49.530> distance<00:00:50.039> it's

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
now you can see it often distance it's

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.700 
now you can see it often distance it's
those<00:00:50.399> little<00:00:50.520> islands<00:00:50.940> just<00:00:51.559> going<00:00:52.559> to<00:00:52.620> take

those little islands just going to take

00:00:52.710 --> 00:01:03.780 
those little islands just going to take

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
you go in behind the waterfall I see a

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:52.460 
you go in behind the waterfall I see a
volition<00:01:49.619> symbol<00:01:50.009> which<00:01:50.909> is<00:01:51.030> pretty<00:01:51.179> cool<00:01:51.470> but

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
volition symbol which is pretty cool but

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:53.539 
volition symbol which is pretty cool but
that's<00:01:52.649> not<00:01:52.740> the<00:01:52.890> main<00:01:52.979> easter<00:01:53.310> egg<00:01:53.369> that's

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549

that's not the main easter egg that's
just<00:01:53.819> the<00:01:54.179> first<00:01:54.209> part<00:01:54.630> i<00:01:54.810> guess<00:01:54.990> you<00:01:55.170> could

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
just the first part i guess you could

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:58.160 
just the first part i guess you could
say<00:01:56.270> not<00:01:57.270> much<00:01:57.390> else<00:01:57.420> other<00:01:57.630> than<00:01:57.750> that<00:01:57.899> so<00:01:58.079> we

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
say not much else other than that so we

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.469 
say not much else other than that so we
go<00:01:58.289> back<00:01:58.319> out<00:01:58.619> the<00:01:59.610> capture<00:01:59.939> card<00:01:59.970> had<00:02:00.270> a<00:02:00.299> bit

go back out the capture card had a bit

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:01.520 
go back out the capture card had a bit
of<00:02:00.509> a<00:02:00.659> seizure<00:02:00.840> there<00:02:01.079> i<00:02:01.110> don't<00:02:01.229> know<00:02:01.409> what
