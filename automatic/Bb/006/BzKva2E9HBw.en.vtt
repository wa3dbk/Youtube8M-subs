00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.049
 is good fact I will show how the 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:10.110
 people always do cell phones 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:12.480
 alone or easy to do and it is well 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:15.120
 fragile to leave on the table and also 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.250
 serves as a glasses holder and also serves 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:21.420
 like remote control door 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:27.510
 this is to leave the controls and stay in that 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:30.179
 format two pyramids for straight 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:32.700
 if you are starting to work 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:36.000
 with cane one thing I worked for 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:39.210
 enough with this thing of a time 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.940
 Ideally you should buy the paper already 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:44.250
 square paper they see in these houses 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:47.160
 of Japanese products as you can 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.930
 order because the Internet is because 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:52.710
 very difficult for you to get a 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:56.610
 absolutely square to work 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:58.500
 So when we have a 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.960
 when we are not an organism more 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.820
 experienced that we will do the same 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.729
 square champion always ends up leaving 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:09.720
 a tip that when you close is not 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:13.140
 cool so just so start this 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:15.869
 here I paid $ 18 well 70 leaves 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:19.049
 so it is more practical for those who are 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:20.460
 starting not have to worry about the 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:23.939
 perfect square 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:26.549
 good for mobile support 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:30.299
 I've done but the team did not fold works 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:34.590
 and drinking takes much paper work 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:37.110
 increase and a half after the dollar does what 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:40.439
 we call small window work here who 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.850
 was here're the drugs he win 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:44.040
 all have names 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:47.280
 This is one of them. 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:50.549
 little as we call then I have 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:52.649
 here my little window made of pitch 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:57.090
 Halfway through the points here 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:58.520
 so now I'm going to charge this to 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:06.259
 medium 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:06.259
 not even the right way 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:21.470
 I remember now I will do what I was doing 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:23.840
 Here's a shit I 'm going to get, this is not the only one here. 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:34.910
 Why this barbie does not matter 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:37.850
 then I 'll double from here to there 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:39.410
 heat that is in this city of Jesus in the 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:41.690
 sky 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:48.400
 now we do the other side the same 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:53.170
 Nothing at all x 1 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:53.170
 then the other at an angle 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:01.250
 now you will see that the mega track of the 

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:04.730
 morning by santinha on the ships lifted 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:07.340
 this one here maybe someone is strange 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:09.500
 this tutorial because I'm left-handed 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:12.709
 then my tendency as well as these 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:15.310
 All these things I raised this flap 

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:23.720
 I joined that part of the partner who 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:27.760
 I put it in and I find it now. 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:37.489
 Same thing about cinema I raised abin 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:40.220
 I threw it there in the wind in 2009 there 's a 

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:45.019
 bit I do it with a role more 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:50.239
 thick that does not make goals like him to 

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:58.760
 ink you can make with this paper is the 

00:03:50.239 --> 00:04:01.280
 practically practically 

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:03.850
 marco madeira ok 

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:03.850
 that's it
