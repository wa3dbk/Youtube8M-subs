simple stuff I don't know why like I
guess<00:01:15.329> I'd<00:01:15.600> is<00:01:15.840> for<00:01:16.049> challenge<00:01:16.500> obviously<00:01:16.649> but

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
guess I'd is for challenge obviously but

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:21.499 
guess I'd is for challenge obviously but
the<00:01:18.030> level<00:01:18.240> design<00:01:18.420> is<00:01:18.659> just<00:01:19.049> so<00:01:20.509> explore

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
the level design is just so explore

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.919 
the level design is just so explore
attic<00:01:21.869> in<00:01:22.020> all<00:01:22.140> over<00:01:22.350> the<00:01:22.439> place<00:01:23.750> this<00:01:24.750> would

00:01:24.919 --> 00:01:24.929 
attic in all over the place this would

00:01:24.929 --> 00:01:26.630 
attic in all over the place this would
be<00:01:24.959> a<00:01:25.079> simple<00:01:25.380> jump<00:01:25.770> with<00:01:25.890> that<00:01:26.069> giant<00:01:26.310> named

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
be a simple jump with that giant named

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:32.330 
be a simple jump with that giant named
weren't<00:01:26.939> even<00:01:27.209> there<00:01:31.100> initially<00:01:32.100> I<00:01:32.130> thought

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
you have had to build girls come out

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.889 
you have had to build girls come out
sequentially<00:01:34.319> but<00:01:34.890> it's<00:01:35.280> not<00:01:35.579> the<00:01:35.609> case<00:01:36.000> which

00:01:36.889 --> 00:01:36.899 
sequentially but it's not the case which

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:39.980 
sequentially but it's not the case which
