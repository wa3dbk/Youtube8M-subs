crafty<00:01:54.869> of<00:01:55.229> by<00:01:55.560> itself<00:01:55.920> and<00:01:56.130> the<00:01:56.189> kids<00:01:56.369> should

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
crafty of by itself and the kids should

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:57.889 
crafty of by itself and the kids should
totally<00:01:56.850> go<00:01:56.969> into<00:01:57.180> marketing<00:01:57.329> but<00:01:57.719> it<00:01:57.810> gets

even more complex and amazing than that

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:02.330 
even more complex and amazing than that
for<00:02:00.810> added<00:02:01.110> level<00:02:01.350> of<00:02:01.409> security<00:02:01.770> and<00:02:02.040> surely

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340
