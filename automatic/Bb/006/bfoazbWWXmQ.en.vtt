00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
that I thought would be a dupe and we're

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.160 
that I thought would be a dupe and we're
just<00:00:35.370> gonna<00:00:35.550> go<00:00:35.790> from<00:00:36.030> there<00:00:36.239> so<00:00:36.450> that's<00:00:36.840> the

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
just gonna go from there so that's the

just gonna go from there so that's the
color<00:00:37.440> right<00:00:37.649> there<00:00:37.920> and<00:00:38.160> so<00:00:38.340> first<00:00:38.579> I<00:00:38.820> decided

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:08.479 
thought were the closest so it'll be the

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:10.270 
thought were the closest so it'll be the
same<00:02:08.509> price<00:02:09.049> but<00:02:09.530> the<00:02:09.769> reason<00:02:10.069> I<00:02:10.129> miss
