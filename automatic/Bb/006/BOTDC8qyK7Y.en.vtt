want<00:02:10.300> to<00:02:11.290> go<00:02:11.590> to<00:02:11.650> search<00:02:12.430> and<00:02:12.940> notice<00:02:13.810> i'm

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:13.960 
want to go to search and notice i'm

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:17.100 
want to go to search and notice i'm
running<00:02:14.260> windows<00:02:14.290> 8<00:02:14.800> this<00:02:15.520> will<00:02:15.760> work<00:02:16.270> in<00:02:16.510> 72

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:17.110 
running windows 8 this will work in 72

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:22.920 
running windows 8 this will work in 72
so<00:02:17.410> right<00:02:17.680> now<00:02:17.710> I'm<00:02:18.070> a<00:02:18.100> search<00:02:19.590> system<00:02:20.590> and<00:02:21.930> the

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 
so right now I'm a search system and the

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:24.449 
so right now I'm a search system and the
search<00:02:23.140> system<00:02:23.680> and<00:02:23.890> then<00:02:23.980> you<00:02:24.100> should<00:02:24.310> get

00:02:24.449 --> 00:02:24.459 
search system and then you should get

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:27.930 
search system and then you should get
system<00:02:25.000> and<00:02:25.590> edit<00:02:26.590> of<00:02:26.680> that<00:02:26.860> added<00:02:27.580> system

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:27.940 
system and edit of that added system

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:30.630 
system and edit of that added system
environment<00:02:28.630> variables<00:02:29.170> and<00:02:29.650> if<00:02:30.160> your<00:02:30.310> window

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:30.640 
environment variables and if your window

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:33.120 
environment variables and if your window
Stefan<00:02:31.060> just<00:02:31.510> open<00:02:32.350> up<00:02:32.410> the<00:02:32.560> start<00:02:32.800> menu<00:02:32.980> and

Stefan just open up the start menu and
search<00:02:33.610> edit<00:02:34.320> environment<00:02:35.320> variables<00:02:36.010> and

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:36.310 
search edit environment variables and

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:39.360 
search edit environment variables and
you<00:02:36.610> should<00:02:36.930> this<00:02:37.930> dialogue<00:02:38.620> should<00:02:39.010> pop<00:02:39.340> up

java<00:03:16.540> 2<00:03:16.750> so<00:03:17.170> minus<00:03:17.350> Program<00:03:17.950> Files<00:03:18.130> Java<00:03:19.019> my<00:03:20.019> I

00:03:20.039 --> 00:03:20.049 
java 2 so minus Program Files Java my I

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:23.699 
java 2 so minus Program Files Java my I
set<00:03:20.650> my<00:03:20.830> I<00:03:20.860> left-<00:03:21.489> a<00:03:21.850> default<00:03:22.239> location<00:03:22.709> so
