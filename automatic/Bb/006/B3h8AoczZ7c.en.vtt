some his passes are off target some of

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:52.400 
some his passes are off target some of

with<00:03:55.470> I<00:03:55.680> think<00:03:55.950> that<00:03:56.040> the<00:03:56.130> Vikings<00:03:56.489> have<00:03:56.760> to

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:57.030 
with I think that the Vikings have to

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:59.750 
with I think that the Vikings have to
strongly<00:03:57.930> consider<00:03:58.190> putting<00:03:59.190> ponder<00:03:59.640> out

00:03:59.750 --> 00:03:59.760 
strongly consider putting ponder out

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:01.069 
strongly consider putting ponder out
there<00:04:00.030> even<00:04:00.480> though<00:04:00.570> he's<00:04:00.690> going<00:04:00.840> to<00:04:00.900> take<00:04:01.019> his

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:01.079 
there even though he's going to take his

00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:03.110 
there even though he's going to take his
lumps<00:04:01.500> it's<00:04:02.010> just<00:04:02.250> it's<00:04:02.459> a<00:04:02.549> different<00:04:02.880> sort<00:04:03.060> of

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:03.120 
lumps it's just it's a different sort of

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:04.699 
lumps it's just it's a different sort of
a<00:04:03.209> thing<00:04:03.239> was<00:04:03.660> there<00:04:03.810> a<00:04:03.840> market<00:04:04.290> difference

00:04:04.699 --> 00:04:04.709 
a thing was there a market difference

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:06.259 
a thing was there a market difference
from<00:04:04.890> when<00:04:05.010> Donovan<00:04:05.340> McNabb<00:04:05.549> was<00:04:05.760> in<00:04:06.000> the<00:04:06.090> game

00:04:06.259 --> 00:04:06.269 
from when Donovan McNabb was in the game

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:07.970 
from when Donovan McNabb was in the game
to<00:04:06.420> a<00:04:06.480> Christian<00:04:06.870> Ponder<00:04:07.230> was<00:04:07.380> in<00:04:07.530> the<00:04:07.620> game<00:04:07.799> in

to a Christian Ponder was in the game in

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:10.039 
to a Christian Ponder was in the game in
