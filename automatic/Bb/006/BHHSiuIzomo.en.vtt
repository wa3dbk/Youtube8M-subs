00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:50.630 
these directly into the cells so we're

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:53.080 
these directly into the cells so we're
micro<00:01:51.169> injecting<00:01:51.709> these<00:01:51.859> into<00:01:52.310> either<00:01:52.459> frog

cells or zebrafish cells so we know how
much<00:01:56.509> we're<00:01:56.749> delivering<00:01:57.200> so<00:01:57.679> we<00:01:57.829> hope<00:01:57.979> to

00:01:58.179 --> 00:01:58.189 
much we're delivering so we hope to

00:01:58.189 --> 00:02:00.399
