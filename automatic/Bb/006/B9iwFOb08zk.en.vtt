think that's what's really neat about it

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.150 
think that's what's really neat about it
and<00:01:51.360> I've<00:01:51.479> seen<00:01:51.690> I<00:01:51.990> did<00:01:52.350> a<00:01:52.380> workshop<00:01:52.500> down<00:01:53.010> in

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:53.160 
and I've seen I did a workshop down in

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:54.080 
and I've seen I did a workshop down in
South<00:01:53.370> America

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
South America

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:55.910 
South America
everybody<00:01:54.810> did<00:01:54.990> a<00:01:55.020> different<00:01:55.200> language<00:01:55.470> and

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
everybody did a different language and

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.460 
everybody did a different language and
it<00:01:56.580> was<00:01:56.700> it<00:01:57.000> was<00:01:57.090> it<00:01:57.510> was<00:01:57.570> really<00:01:57.840> neat<00:01:58.200> for<00:01:58.229> me

00:01:58.460 --> 00:01:58.470 
it was it was it was really neat for me

00:01:58.470 --> 00:01:59.690 
it was it was it was really neat for me
because<00:01:58.740> it<00:01:58.830> reminded<00:01:59.250> me<00:01:59.310> there's<00:01:59.520> other

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
because it reminded me there's other

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.090 
because it reminded me there's other
ways<00:01:59.880> to<00:01:59.940> do<00:02:00.270> it<00:02:00.300> than<00:02:00.420> the<00:02:00.660> way<00:02:00.780> I<00:02:00.810> do<00:02:00.960> it<00:02:01.110> okay

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
ways to do it than the way I do it okay

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.070 
ways to do it than the way I do it okay
and<00:02:03.090> we'll<00:02:03.210> take<00:02:03.360> a<00:02:03.420> shot

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:04.080 
and we'll take a shot

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:06.290 
and we'll take a shot
and<00:02:04.710> literally<00:02:05.100> imperfections<00:02:05.729> I<00:02:06.030> mean<00:02:06.180> you

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:06.300 
and literally imperfections I mean you

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:09.859 
and literally imperfections I mean you
can't<00:02:06.600> control<00:02:06.810> paint<00:02:07.640> to<00:02:08.640> the<00:02:08.820> to<00:02:09.420> the<00:02:09.540> degree

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
can't control paint to the to the degree

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:12.080 
can't control paint to the to the degree
you<00:02:10.080> can<00:02:10.229> control<00:02:10.709> like<00:02:10.770> sail<00:02:11.370> line<00:02:11.700> in

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
you can control like sail line in

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:14.990 
you can control like sail line in
classical<00:02:12.570> animation<00:02:12.950> so<00:02:13.950> it's<00:02:14.310> nice<00:02:14.520> just<00:02:14.550> to

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
classical animation so it's nice just to

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.310 
classical animation so it's nice just to
let<00:02:15.390> it<00:02:15.420> go<00:02:16.100> let<00:02:17.100> it<00:02:17.130> have<00:02:17.310> imperfections<00:02:18.320> let

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:19.320 
let it go let it have imperfections let

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:23.660 
let it go let it have imperfections let
it<00:02:19.440> just<00:02:19.650> just<00:02:20.220> happen<00:02:22.400> did<00:02:23.400> I<00:02:23.459> go<00:02:23.640> through

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
it just just happen did I go through

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:27.030 
it just just happen did I go through
boxes<00:02:24.300> and<00:02:24.480> boxes<00:02:24.600> and<00:02:24.900> q-tips<00:02:25.320> doing<00:02:25.830> this

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 
boxes and boxes and q-tips doing this

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:31.790 
boxes and boxes and q-tips doing this
our<00:02:28.040> swamp<00:02:28.310> cotton<00:02:28.760> swabs

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:31.800 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:34.580 

I<00:02:31.830> tend<00:02:32.580> to<00:02:32.670> mm-hmm<00:02:33.750> I<00:02:33.780> shouldn't<00:02:34.350> do<00:02:34.410> it<00:02:34.440> this

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
I tend to mm-hmm I shouldn't do it this

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:36.890 
I tend to mm-hmm I shouldn't do it this
with<00:02:34.800> my<00:02:34.950> mouth<00:02:35.280> but<00:02:36.000> I<00:02:36.180> tend<00:02:36.390> to<00:02:36.480> wet<00:02:36.690> it<00:02:36.720> with

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
with my mouth but I tend to wet it with

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:38.450 
with my mouth but I tend to wet it with
my<00:02:37.080> mouth<00:02:37.320> just<00:02:37.620> because<00:02:37.860> I<00:02:38.010> get<00:02:38.220> a<00:02:38.250> better

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:38.460 
my mouth just because I get a better

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:40.130 
my mouth just because I get a better
control<00:02:38.790> as<00:02:39.090> to<00:02:39.210> how<00:02:39.270> much<00:02:39.450> moisture<00:02:39.780> is<00:02:40.110> in

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
control as to how much moisture is in

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:43.490 
control as to how much moisture is in
there<00:02:40.440> that<00:02:40.650> can<00:02:41.460> dry<00:02:41.760> you<00:02:41.820> it<00:02:42.290> you<00:02:43.290> got<00:02:43.410> to

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
there that can dry you it you got to

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:46.040 
there that can dry you it you got to
make<00:02:43.620> sure<00:02:43.830> you<00:02:43.950> don't<00:02:44.240> have<00:02:45.240> paint<00:02:45.510> on<00:02:45.600> me<00:02:45.780> if

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:46.050 
make sure you don't have paint on me if

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:49.630 
make sure you don't have paint on me if
you<00:02:46.140> did<00:02:46.350> rather<00:02:47.160> sconce<00:02:47.610> fun<00:02:48.020> okay<00:02:49.020> over<00:02:49.350> here

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:49.640 
you did rather sconce fun okay over here

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:52.280 
you did rather sconce fun okay over here
so<00:02:50.640> we're<00:02:50.760> almost<00:02:50.880> there<00:02:51.240> you<00:02:52.050> can<00:02:52.170> see

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
so we're almost there you can see

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:53.720 
so we're almost there you can see
there's<00:02:52.440> a<00:02:52.530> little<00:02:52.680> bit<00:02:52.830> of<00:02:53.010> trailing<00:02:53.550> of<00:02:53.640> the

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
there's a little bit of trailing of the

00:02:53.730 --> 00:03:01.700 
there's a little bit of trailing of the
old<00:02:54.380> positions<00:02:55.670> there<00:02:56.670> that's<00:02:57.120> okay<00:03:00.620> now<00:03:01.620> I'm

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:01.710 
old positions there that's okay now I'm

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:03.170 
old positions there that's okay now I'm
doing<00:03:01.860> something<00:03:02.130> very<00:03:02.250> simple<00:03:02.700> of<00:03:02.940> course

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
doing something very simple of course

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:05.290 
doing something very simple of course
you<00:03:03.270> can<00:03:03.420> make<00:03:03.600> much<00:03:03.810> more<00:03:03.990> complicated

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:05.300 
you can make much more complicated

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:09.560 
you can make much more complicated
imagery<00:03:06.300> and<00:03:07.550> of<00:03:08.550> course<00:03:08.790> adding<00:03:08.940> color<00:03:09.270> is<00:03:09.540> a

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:09.570 
imagery and of course adding color is a

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:11.360 
imagery and of course adding color is a
whole<00:03:09.810> other<00:03:09.960> layer<00:03:10.200> of<00:03:10.380> complexity<00:03:10.950> to<00:03:11.220> this

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
whole other layer of complexity to this

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:11.930 
whole other layer of complexity to this
thing

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:11.940 
thing

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:14.060 
thing
okay<00:03:12.600> so<00:03:12.660> we've<00:03:12.960> almost<00:03:13.170> got<00:03:13.500> this<00:03:13.680> here<00:03:13.950> we're

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:14.070 
okay so we've almost got this here we're

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:16.640 
okay so we've almost got this here we're
going<00:03:14.190> to<00:03:14.250> take<00:03:14.340> a<00:03:14.370> shot<00:03:15.170> okay<00:03:16.170> and<00:03:16.410> then

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
going to take a shot okay and then

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:18.620 
going to take a shot okay and then
almost<00:03:17.550> there<00:03:17.820> we're<00:03:17.970> almost<00:03:18.090> in<00:03:18.270> the<00:03:18.330> corner

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:18.630 
almost there we're almost in the corner

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:25.280 
almost there we're almost in the corner
here<00:03:19.250> okay<00:03:22.250> the<00:03:23.250> edge<00:03:23.400> here<00:03:23.840> and<00:03:24.840> I<00:03:24.930> think<00:03:25.020> what

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290 
here okay the edge here and I think what

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:31.860 
here okay the edge here and I think what
I'll<00:03:25.440> do<00:03:25.680> is<00:03:26.420> just<00:03:27.420> have<00:03:27.600> the<00:03:27.750> eyes<00:03:27.870> claws<00:03:28.470> too

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:31.870 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:36.730 

that's<00:03:32.290> two

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:36.740 

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:40.500 

okay

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:40.510 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:41.990 

oops

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000 
oops

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.940 
oops
I<00:03:42.030> mean<00:03:42.570> I<00:03:42.690> just<00:03:42.720> get<00:03:43.230> good<00:03:43.380> at<00:03:43.530> knowing<00:03:43.680> which

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:43.950 
I mean I just get good at knowing which

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:46.730 
I mean I just get good at knowing which
much<00:03:44.460> spindle<00:03:44.790> the<00:03:44.880> q-tip<00:03:45.270> was<00:03:45.500> dirty<00:03:46.500> okay

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:46.740 
much spindle the q-tip was dirty okay

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:54.110 
much spindle the q-tip was dirty okay
and<00:03:47.400> we'll<00:03:47.640> take<00:03:47.700> a<00:03:47.760> shot<00:03:49.400> okay<00:03:52.550> now<00:03:53.550> to<00:03:53.880> close

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:54.120 
and we'll take a shot okay now to close

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:55.880 
and we'll take a shot okay now to close
the<00:03:54.390> eye<00:03:54.420> okay<00:03:55.290> that's<00:03:55.500> fine

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:55.890 
the eye okay that's fine

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:57.350 
the eye okay that's fine
so<00:03:56.250> what<00:03:56.370> we're<00:03:56.490> going<00:03:56.640> to<00:03:56.730> do<00:03:56.910> is<00:03:57.180> actually

00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:57.360 
so what we're going to do is actually

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:02.000 
so what we're going to do is actually
just<00:03:57.810> draw<00:03:58.050> the<00:03:58.470> line<00:03:58.680> down<00:03:59.070> a<00:03:59.100> minute<00:04:00.530> so<00:04:01.530> it's

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:02.010 
just draw the line down a minute so it's

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:03.770 
just draw the line down a minute so it's
really<00:04:02.160> simple<00:04:02.610> one<00:04:03.300> thing<00:04:03.480> you<00:04:03.540> have<00:04:03.630> to<00:04:03.750> be

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:03.780 
really simple one thing you have to be

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:06.110 
really simple one thing you have to be
careful<00:04:04.260> of<00:04:04.290> is<00:04:04.470> not<00:04:04.500> to<00:04:04.950> do<00:04:05.190> in<00:04:05.700> a<00:04:05.790> way<00:04:05.940> what

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:06.120 
careful of is not to do in a way what
