full<00:01:59.040> we<00:01:59.190> years<00:01:59.460> and<00:01:59.670> everything<00:01:59.870> reverse<00:02:00.870> is

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:01.050 
full we years and everything reverse is

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:04.520 
full we years and everything reverse is
real<00:02:01.260> pretty<00:02:01.580> happy<00:02:02.580> with<00:02:02.700> that<00:02:03.350> and<00:02:04.350> then<00:02:04.440> we

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
real pretty happy with that and then we

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.760 
real pretty happy with that and then we
get<00:02:04.650> a<00:02:04.710> crusty<00:02:05.610> 1942<00:02:06.570> and<00:02:06.900> of<00:02:06.990> course<00:02:07.290> can't

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
get a crusty 1942 and of course can't

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.560 
get a crusty 1942 and of course can't
get<00:02:08.520> it<00:02:08.640> Wheaties<00:02:08.970> without<00:02:09.270> hitting<00:02:09.450> the

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:09.570 
get it Wheaties without hitting the

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:12.680 
get it Wheaties without hitting the
forty<00:02:09.899> four<00:02:10.110> plane<00:02:11.090> and<00:02:12.090> then<00:02:12.450> a<00:02:12.480> little

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
forty four plane and then a little

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:16.010 
forty four plane and then a little
junker<00:02:13.350> ring<00:02:14.150> that<00:02:15.150> just<00:02:15.390> looks<00:02:15.630> like<00:02:15.690> a<00:02:15.780> piece

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.020 
junker ring that just looks like a piece

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:18.650 
junker ring that just looks like a piece
of<00:02:16.080> plastic<00:02:16.320> in<00:02:16.830> there<00:02:17.070> and<00:02:17.310> the<00:02:17.660> it's

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
of plastic in there and the it's

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.600 
of plastic in there and the it's
aluminum<00:02:19.170> if<00:02:19.710> this<00:02:19.890> would<00:02:20.070> have<00:02:20.130> been<00:02:20.250> a<00:02:20.280> zinc

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
aluminum if this would have been a zinc

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:22.010 
aluminum if this would have been a zinc
tone<00:02:20.790> on<00:02:20.970> the<00:02:21.000> surface<00:02:21.450> I<00:02:21.570> would<00:02:21.720> have<00:02:21.810> skipped

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:22.020 
tone on the surface I would have skipped

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:24.200 
tone on the surface I would have skipped
it<00:02:22.230> but<00:02:22.380> uh<00:02:22.410> I<00:02:22.830> checked<00:02:23.490> a<00:02:23.670> couple<00:02:23.940> different

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:24.210 
it but uh I checked a couple different

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:26.450 
it but uh I checked a couple different
directions<00:02:24.600> in<00:02:24.690> the<00:02:24.780> hit<00:02:24.930> 12:30<00:02:25.470> 1231<00:02:26.250> and

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:26.460 
directions in the hit 12:30 1231 and

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:27.950 
directions in the hit 12:30 1231 and
sinks<00:02:26.820> normally<00:02:27.120> don't<00:02:27.300> hit<00:02:27.420> that<00:02:27.450> low<00:02:27.660> unless

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:27.960 
sinks normally don't hit that low unless

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:30.140 
sinks normally don't hit that low unless
it<00:02:28.140> really<00:02:28.290> chewed<00:02:28.560> up<00:02:28.790> it<00:02:29.790> was<00:02:29.910> a<00:02:29.970> couple

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
it really chewed up it was a couple

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.450 
it really chewed up it was a couple
inches<00:02:30.330> deep<00:02:30.660> so<00:02:30.900> I<00:02:31.170> figured<00:02:31.440> it<00:02:31.560> was<00:02:31.650> not

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:32.460 
inches deep so I figured it was not

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:34.310 
inches deep so I figured it was not
gonna<00:02:32.670> be<00:02:32.760> a<00:02:32.880> zinc<00:02:33.180> penny<00:02:33.390> which<00:02:33.600> is<00:02:33.780> why<00:02:33.960> dug

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:34.320 
gonna be a zinc penny which is why dug

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:37.550 
gonna be a zinc penny which is why dug
it<00:02:35.480> because<00:02:36.480> uh<00:02:36.510> since<00:02:36.870> it<00:02:36.959> was<00:02:37.050> raining<00:02:37.230> out

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
it because uh since it was raining out

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:40.040 
it because uh since it was raining out
and<00:02:37.830> I<00:02:37.950> had<00:02:38.040> limited<00:02:38.400> time<00:02:38.640> I<00:02:38.670> was<00:02:38.970> just<00:02:39.150> kind

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050 
and I had limited time I was just kind

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:41.660 
and I had limited time I was just kind
of<00:02:40.110> getting<00:02:40.350> the<00:02:40.530> best<00:02:40.560> the<00:02:40.860> best<00:02:40.980> signals<00:02:41.520> and

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
of getting the best the best signals and

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:44.270 
of getting the best the best signals and
all<00:02:41.730> the<00:02:41.880> solid<00:02:42.660> deep<00:02:42.840> targets<00:02:43.320> well<00:02:44.190> it

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
all the solid deep targets well it

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.310 
all the solid deep targets well it
really<00:02:44.490> wasn't<00:02:44.670> watching<00:02:44.910> that<00:02:45.209> yard<00:02:45.420> pass

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:46.320 
really wasn't watching that yard pass

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:47.810 
really wasn't watching that yard pass
that<00:02:46.560> was<00:02:46.650> my<00:02:46.770> little<00:02:46.860> hunt<00:02:47.130> today<00:02:47.250> thanks
