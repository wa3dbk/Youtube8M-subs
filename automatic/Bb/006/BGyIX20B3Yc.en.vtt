00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:10.810
 The Power of Sea Salt - presented by Science at NASA. 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.510
 On Friday, June 10, when the Delta 2 rocket took off 

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:18.100
 of the Vandenberg Air Force Base in California, rumbling in 

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:22.230
 a morning of blue sky over a column of white smoke, some 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:25.110
 viewers felt that they could smell a pinch of salt between 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:27.380
 the combustion gas of the rocket. 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:30.150
 Was it sprayed from the nearby Pacific Ocean? 

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:33.390
 o Did it have to do with the rocket's payload itself? 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:36.700
 The rocket was carrying on board a detector called "Aquarius" in a 

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:39.820
 mission to make a map of the salt of the seas of our planet. 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.250
 Researchers suspect that the salinity of Earth's oceans has 

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:46.040
 a very profound impact on climate, as well as salt levels 

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:51.950
 in our bodies they influence the delicate internal balance. 

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:55.700
 This is why the Aquarius mission is so important. 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:59.180
 "Based on decades of historical data collected from the oceans by ships and 

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:02.460
 buoys, we know that salinity has changed 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:05.390
 in the last 40 years, "says the principal researcher 

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:09.130
 from Aquarius, Gary Lagerloef, a scientist from 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.430
 independent laboratory for Earth and Space Research, in Seattle. 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:17.810
 "Something fundamental is happening in the water cycle." 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:21.490
 In some regions, such as the subtropical Atlantic, salinity is 

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:24.610
 is increasing, which means that more fresh water is being lost 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.490
 by means of evaporation on the surface of the sea. 

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:30.150
 But nobody knows why this is happening; neither anyone 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:33.780
 manages to explain why rainfall has increased in other areas and 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:35.890
 decreased salinity. 

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:39.600
 To solve these mysteries, scientists need a comprehensive vision 

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:42.330
 of global salinity. 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:45.400
 Within a few months, Aquarius will collect as many measurements 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.510
 of the surface salinity of the sea as in all 125 years 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.430
 of historical records, which were collected by boats and buoys. 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:56.110
 Circulating the Earth on board the SAC-D satellite of Argentina, 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.260
 Aquarius is one of the most sensitive microwave radiometers 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.480
 that have been built, and it's the first NASA detector that will track the 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:04.900
 salinity of the sea from space. 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.820
 "It can detect concentrations as low as 0.2 parts of salt in 1,000 parts 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:13.590
 of water - which is equivalent to dissolving a pint of salt in a gallon of water. 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:16.650
 A human could not perceive a concentration of salt so low, 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:20.670
 however, Aquarius will be able to detect it by orbiting 408 miles 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:23.370
 on Earth, "says Lagerloef. 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:26.100
 Salinity, in conjunction with temperature, governs the 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:28.010
 density of sea water. 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:30.990
 The saltier the water, the denser it is. 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:33.650
 The density, in turn, is what drives the currents which carry the heat through 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:35.710
 of the planet. 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:38.690
 "For example," says Lagerloef, "The Gulf Stream carries 

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:41.860
 heat to higher latitudes and in this way moderates the climate. 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:43.240
 When these currents are diverted due to variations in density, 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:48.260
 climatic patterns such as precipitation and temperature are altered. " 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:51.300
 Could salinity be causing these changes? 

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:54.540
 To have the answers, the researchers look at the sky. 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:56.570
 Aquarius, who is expected to soon reveal the 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:59.030
 power of sea salt. 

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:02.170
