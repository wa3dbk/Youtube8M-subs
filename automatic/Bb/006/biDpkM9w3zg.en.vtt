00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:21.240 
which is right here you hook these two
together<00:02:18.480> and<00:02:19.480> this<00:02:20.380> whole<00:02:20.560> mechanism<00:02:20.740> here

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250 
together and this whole mechanism here

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:22.650 
together and this whole mechanism here
this<00:02:21.430> is<00:02:21.580> the<00:02:21.670> wire<00:02:21.850> comes<00:02:22.090> out<00:02:22.210> of<00:02:22.300> your<00:02:22.390> coil

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:22.660 
this is the wire comes out of your coil

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:26.250 
this is the wire comes out of your coil
that<00:02:23.290> goes<00:02:23.500> to<00:02:23.680> your<00:02:24.180> plugs<00:02:25.180> and<00:02:25.390> wires<00:02:25.420> so<00:02:26.170> we

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:26.260 
that goes to your plugs and wires so we

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:27.600 
that goes to your plugs and wires so we
have<00:02:26.350> a<00:02:26.410> spark<00:02:26.710> plug<00:02:26.770> here<00:02:27.010> to<00:02:27.220> demonstrate

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610 
have a spark plug here to demonstrate

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:30.449 
have a spark plug here to demonstrate
how<00:02:27.760> the<00:02:27.820> spark<00:02:28.410> travels<00:02:29.410> what<00:02:30.250> you're<00:02:30.340> going

00:02:30.449 --> 00:02:30.459 
how the spark travels what you're going

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:31.320 
how the spark travels what you're going
to<00:02:30.520> do<00:02:30.610> is<00:02:30.730> you're<00:02:30.820> going<00:02:30.910> to<00:02:30.970> take<00:02:31.120> your

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:31.330 
to do is you're going to take your

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:33.690 
to do is you're going to take your
jumper<00:02:31.720> wire<00:02:31.930> and<00:02:32.260> tap<00:02:33.070> it<00:02:33.220> against<00:02:33.400> clean

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:33.700 
jumper wire and tap it against clean

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:35.250 
jumper wire and tap it against clean
ground<00:02:34.000> on<00:02:34.360> your<00:02:34.630> engine<00:02:34.840> block<00:02:34.959> could<00:02:35.230> be

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:35.260 
ground on your engine block could be

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:39.750 
ground on your engine block could be
manifold<00:02:35.830> it<00:02:36.760> could<00:02:37.000> be<00:02:38.520> anywhere<00:02:39.520> on<00:02:39.640> the

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 
manifold it could be anywhere on the

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:42.270 
manifold it could be anywhere on the
engine<00:02:40.060> that's<00:02:40.180> clean<00:02:40.510> and<00:02:41.500> it<00:02:41.590> should<00:02:41.830> spark

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.280 
engine that's clean and it should spark

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:43.770 
engine that's clean and it should spark
just<00:02:42.880> like<00:02:43.030> we're<00:02:43.180> showing<00:02:43.360> here<00:02:43.510> in<00:02:43.690> the

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
just like we're showing here in the

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:44.280 
just like we're showing here in the
video

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:44.290 
video

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:46.650 
video
that's<00:02:44.950> demonstrating<00:02:45.610> that<00:02:45.730> the<00:02:45.940> spark<00:02:46.510> is

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:46.660 
that's demonstrating that the spark is

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:55.940 
that's demonstrating that the spark is
good<00:02:46.900> and<00:02:47.170> the<00:02:47.800> coil<00:02:48.100> is<00:02:48.340> working<00:02:48.760> properly

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:59.070 

and<00:02:56.950> that's<00:02:57.250> how<00:02:57.400> you<00:02:57.459> test<00:02:57.790> it<00:02:57.970> spark<00:02:58.300> I'm

00:02:59.070 --> 00:02:59.080 
and that's how you test it spark I'm

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:01.980 
and that's how you test it spark I'm
here<00:02:59.320> accel<00:02:59.650> coil
