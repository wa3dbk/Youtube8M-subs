like this and I decided to make this
same<00:01:14.960> so<00:01:15.960> yeah<00:01:16.520> and<00:01:17.520> I<00:01:17.700> think<00:01:18.290> it's<00:01:19.290> one<00:01:19.530> of<00:01:19.619> my

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
same so yeah and I think it's one of my

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.330 
same so yeah and I think it's one of my
best<00:01:20.070> mock<00:01:20.369> so<00:01:20.549> far<00:01:21.380> in<00:01:22.380> relation<00:01:22.830> to<00:01:22.860> load<00:01:23.220> of

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
best mock so far in relation to load of

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:28.160 
best mock so far in relation to load of
reinforced<00:01:24.650> because<00:01:25.650> King<00:01:26.220> I<00:01:26.610> can<00:01:27.090> I<00:01:27.479> can

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
reinforced because King I can I can

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.859 
reinforced because King I can I can
match<00:01:28.380> this<00:01:28.619> with<00:01:28.850> with<00:01:29.850> towers<00:01:30.270> bases<00:01:30.750> you

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
match this with with towers bases you

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:39.800 
match this with with towers bases you
know<00:01:37.400> it's<00:01:38.400> only<00:01:38.549> one<00:01:38.909> great<00:01:39.119> base<00:01:39.329> blip<00:01:39.600> big

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
know it's only one great base blip big

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.830 
know it's only one great base blip big
but<00:01:40.079> I<00:01:40.350> think<00:01:40.950> it's<00:01:41.130> it's<00:01:41.880> decent<00:01:42.390> for<00:01:42.600> this

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
but I think it's it's decent for this

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:48.170 
but I think it's it's decent for this
kind<00:01:43.049> of<00:01:43.079> muck<00:01:43.259> I<00:01:44.720> have<00:01:45.740> one<00:01:46.740> room<00:01:47.159> I<00:01:47.460> didn't
