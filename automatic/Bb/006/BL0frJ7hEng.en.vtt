00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
 We will do morning watering 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:05.180
 with a shower head, a shower, 

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:09.080
 which mimics rainwater. 

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:14.819
 Already, first thing is not to leave hot water in the pipe, 

00:00:14.819 --> 00:00:16.449
 if it's already heated in the morning ... 

00:00:16.449 --> 00:00:19.079
 Well, it's about ten o'clock! 

00:00:19.079 --> 00:00:22.079
 the sun is not yet very strong! 

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:25.220
 We will fill the pots, 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:27.560
 until it flows below. 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:30.829
 The water must absolutely flow under the pot, 

00:00:30.829 --> 00:00:33.449
 this way, you water your trees properly. 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:41.070
 It's a simple gesture, but it's actually relatively 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.780
 long to learn. 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:48.140
 You see that we do not water the leaf, 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:50.850
 nor the trunk, we water mainly as the pot. 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.750
 We can refresh the pot too! 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:56.540
 We give a large amount of water, 

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:12.330
 I have a habit, 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:14.780
 to refresh the foliage at night. 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:18.450
 in the morning I do not do it. Because as the sun goes up, 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.450
 it may burn the leaf. 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.950
 See that I come back to the trees, 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:28.390
 to give them a maximum 

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:29.720
 water ... 

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:38.890
 So approaching me like that 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:42.370
 I am wasting a minimum of water, even if it flows below. 

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:45.370
 At the same time, it is an effective maximum. 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:59.490
 As we said, this one is problematic, the water runs off the sides, 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.690
 because of the hull, so you have to come back to it 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:03.470
 often enough. 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.160
 Otherwise we will waste the substrate as watering. 

00:02:14.889 --> 00:02:16.749
 Maple trees need a lot of water. 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:20.719
 Especially in hot weather, 

00:02:20.719 --> 00:02:22.139
 juniper too, 

00:02:23.639 --> 00:02:26.639
 juniper, I cultivate it in the shade because of that. 

00:02:28.649 --> 00:02:31.649
 It needs a lot of water and not necessarily direct sun. 

00:02:35.369 --> 00:02:38.909
 We will come back to the exhibition of trees, it is important. 

00:02:39.759 --> 00:02:44.779
 So that everyone can understand where to expose their trees, 

00:02:45.039 --> 00:02:46.439
 in the garden. 

00:02:46.439 --> 00:02:49.439
 What are the proper positions for all trees? 

00:02:51.609 --> 00:02:54.039
 Some trees like this one for example 

00:02:54.039 --> 00:02:56.919
 the water tends to slide over the pot. 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:59.700
 If I water quickly like that, 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:01.260
 immediately the water slides! 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.720
 We are not efficient, so we are still waiting for the absorption of water, 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:07.320
 and we come back to it ... 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.500
 until it flows beneath. 

00:03:11.149 --> 00:03:14.149
 Olives need water, but less. 

00:03:14.949 --> 00:03:17.949
 We do not bother to drown them! 

00:03:18.609 --> 00:03:21.909
 The amount of water, 

00:03:21.909 --> 00:03:25.259
 it is not quite identical for trees. 

00:03:25.259 --> 00:03:28.919
 Anyway, when it's hot, the general rule is to water at least twice a day, 

00:03:28.919 --> 00:03:30.700
 three if you can ... 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:38.120
 There you go!
