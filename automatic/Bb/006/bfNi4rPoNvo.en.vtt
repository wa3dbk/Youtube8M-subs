msg

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:47.330 

some<00:02:44.040> fish<00:02:44.280> sauce

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:49.250 

exactly<00:02:47.760> sure<00:02:47.940> how<00:02:48.090> much<00:02:48.209> that<00:02:48.450> is<00:02:48.660> but<00:02:48.690> my

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
exactly sure how much that is but my

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:53.059 
exactly sure how much that is but my
guess<00:02:49.530> would<00:02:49.590> be<00:02:49.860> about<00:02:50.250> a<00:02:51.150> tablespoon<00:02:52.069> now

00:02:53.059 --> 00:02:53.069 
guess would be about a tablespoon now

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:54.830 
guess would be about a tablespoon now
the<00:02:53.129> reason<00:02:53.430> why<00:02:53.670> she<00:02:53.879> makes<00:02:54.120> all<00:02:54.330> of<00:02:54.360> this<00:02:54.569> up

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
the reason why she makes all of this up

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:58.699 
the reason why she makes all of this up
burst<00:02:55.790> into<00:02:56.790> one<00:02:57.050> before<00:02:58.050> she<00:02:58.230> quit<00:02:58.410> stuff<00:02:58.620> up

00:02:58.699 --> 00:02:58.709 
burst into one before she quit stuff up

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:02.570 
burst into one before she quit stuff up
I<00:02:58.860> again<00:02:59.250> is<00:02:59.489> that<00:02:59.550> she<00:03:00.239> likes<00:03:00.720> to<00:03:01.400> mix<00:03:02.400> this

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:02.580 
I again is that she likes to mix this

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:03.990 
I again is that she likes to mix this
all<00:03:02.790> up

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:04.000 
all up

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.180 
all up
put<00:03:04.240> the<00:03:04.330> plier<00:03:04.630> last<00:03:05.110> so<00:03:05.620> that<00:03:05.800> the<00:03:05.920> papaya

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:06.190 
put the plier last so that the papaya

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:08.730 
put the plier last so that the papaya
shreds<00:03:06.580> stay<00:03:06.940> crisp<00:03:07.410> depending<00:03:08.410> on<00:03:08.530> how<00:03:08.680> you

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:08.740 
shreds stay crisp depending on how you

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:10.290 
shreds stay crisp depending on how you
like<00:03:08.950> to<00:03:09.100> do<00:03:09.220> this<00:03:09.430> you<00:03:09.580> could<00:03:09.700> actually<00:03:09.940> put

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:10.300 
like to do this you could actually put

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:12.990 
like to do this you could actually put
the<00:03:10.390> papaya<00:03:10.750> shreds<00:03:11.740> in<00:03:11.950> and<00:03:12.280> add<00:03:12.760> these

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:13.000 
the papaya shreds in and add these

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.780 
the papaya shreds in and add these
ingredients<00:03:13.440> at<00:03:14.440> the<00:03:14.560> same<00:03:14.770> time

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:19.680 

so

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:19.690 
so

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:26.410 
so
you<00:03:19.780> for<00:03:20.020> my<00:03:20.200> room

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:26.420 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:30.850 

looks<00:03:26.720> like<00:03:27.430> half<00:03:28.430> a

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:30.860 

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:38.699 

shrimp<00:03:31.340> sauce

00:03:38.699 --> 00:03:38.709 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:41.770 

making<00:03:39.709> sure<00:03:39.890> that's<00:03:40.040> all<00:03:40.159> mixed<00:03:40.489> in<00:03:40.760> it<00:03:41.269> looks

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:41.780 
making sure that's all mixed in it looks

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:43.470 
making sure that's all mixed in it looks
like<00:03:41.840> she<00:03:42.110> doesn't<00:03:42.379> really<00:03:42.620> smash<00:03:43.099> the

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:43.480 
like she doesn't really smash the

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:49.000 
like she doesn't really smash the
tomatoes<00:03:46.780> very<00:03:47.780> much<00:03:48.110> so<00:03:48.470> there's<00:03:48.920> still

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:49.010 
tomatoes very much so there's still

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:51.140 
tomatoes very much so there's still
tomato<00:03:49.519> chunks<00:03:49.879> in<00:03:50.090> there

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:51.150

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:52.890 
it's just kind of the mixing of the

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:54.480 
it's just kind of the mixing of the
sauce<00:03:53.099> that<00:03:53.400> she's<00:03:53.579> come
