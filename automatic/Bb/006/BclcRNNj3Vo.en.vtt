00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:07.370
 not like the best read page 

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:09.679
 failed 

00:00:09.679 --> 00:00:11.799
 On such a game, the qualities are not only near me 

00:00:11.799 --> 00:00:15.169
 we were upset we had great moments 

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:17.310
 becomes more expensive 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:18.779
 in this case from the middle of the first 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:20.720
 In time we controlled 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:22.259
 match outcome 

00:00:22.259 --> 00:00:25.539
 and when they defended when they attacked but 

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:27.419
 not learned from this proceeded 

00:00:27.419 --> 00:00:30.219
 what happened after the team scored 

00:00:30.219 --> 00:00:33.020
 literally became parking spaces 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:34.449
 I have no one just 

00:00:34.449 --> 00:00:36.630
 many downtown 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.650
 by the way they imposed a penalty on me 

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:41.380
 a little bit like this 

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:44.100
 nervousness of course did not stop keeping 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.690
 to control 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:49.420
 first did not add but 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:51.180
 basically I think a lot of release 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.970
 penalty and angular echoes 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:55.880
 I'm sorry not surprised by his game because 

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:58.670
 that they played astride very much on 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:01.670
 ice dancing with a hitter 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:04.350
 iraq's names trust seemed not ready 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:05.840
 Pyshma is designed for short and medium 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:07.500
 pass 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.280
 it turned out that the board 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:12.560
 on tuesday the ball turns out right after all 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:15.130
 forward he's not a single attacker 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:18.460
 but to say that they purely won 

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:21.530
 there was a first half the picture was in general 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:22.750
 joyless 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:25.070
 interest phrasebook stays locker room 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:26.090
 serious 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:28.560
 on which aspects the main aspect of them 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.540
 will get more attention sought 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.130
 add movement and 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.420
 take control of the ball 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:36.659
 two questions harmonious game 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.750
 midfield under any condition 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:41.750
 Alexander years now while a matter of time 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:45.630
 I do not know 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.670
 principles today 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.460
 except for the middle of the first 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:52.790
 this year's halftime super altai y 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:54.900
 us, the center of the field of protection was obtained 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:56.600
 Mironov 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:59.470
 we can not play 90 minutes of something under 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:02.549
 ships whose country pyramid zenith spent 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:04.979
 weeks of the match in Portugal on the idea 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:07.159
 the stupidity was to stay more power 

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:08.910
 on the ending however from such 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.560
 no impressions 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.670
 turnover was the impression that neither 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:14.650
 the more locomotive arrange more than 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:16.889
 zenith 

00:02:16.889 --> 00:02:19.079
 absorption that the nomination team is not 

00:02:19.079 --> 00:02:21.359
 able to add dissatisfaction with the fact that 

00:02:21.359 --> 00:02:23.309
 at least a point he is 

00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:24.739
 I disagree 

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:27.060
 in the second half we had three 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:28.659
 one hundred percent of the moments of the zenith 

00:02:28.659 --> 00:02:29.619
 knew 

00:02:29.619 --> 00:02:31.439
 that's the whole picture 

00:02:31.439 --> 00:02:33.180
 I know I don't think we lost 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:34.469
 physically 

00:02:34.469 --> 00:02:37.469
 But after two for the third probably play 

00:02:38.499 --> 00:02:40.069
 not the fact that he 

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:43.009
 I don't think they didn't stop 

00:02:43.009 --> 00:02:45.109
 the owner and he seems to me 

00:02:45.109 --> 00:02:46.259
 a little bit 

00:02:46.259 --> 00:02:48.319
 Well tightened that he 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:50.609
 in 2 minutes two days 

00:02:50.609 --> 00:02:52.719
 played two days before the event of probable 

00:02:52.719 --> 00:02:54.249
 patent spiked 

00:02:54.249 --> 00:02:57.109
 get used to it and everything is fine pm expert 

00:02:57.109 --> 00:02:59.649
 zenith all the same there were two good points 

00:02:59.649 --> 00:03:02.809
 starting with our understanding 

00:03:02.809 --> 00:03:04.099
 you had a wonderful moment 

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:07.169
 why I decided to give up two cattle 

00:03:07.169 --> 00:03:10.519
 beautiful sunshine smoke 

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:13.229
 mass sports do not understand why 

00:03:13.229 --> 00:03:16.229
 usually greedy hit 

00:03:16.909 --> 00:03:20.069
 Arab four points in matches with CSKA and 

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:22.669
 Zenith on the road as a whole is probably 

00:03:22.669 --> 00:03:25.439
 the worst result 

00:03:25.439 --> 00:03:28.089
 No wonder the situation is our mission 

00:03:28.089 --> 00:03:29.679
 everyone to work 

00:03:29.679 --> 00:03:31.069
 and 

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:33.659
 Rubin will win Spartak 

00:03:33.659 --> 00:03:36.189
 Moscow escaped from the deck of Manchester 

00:03:36.189 --> 00:03:37.760
 according unsatisfactory 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:40.150
 a very pessimistic attitude may do something 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:41.130
 positive 

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:43.099
 there is what happened 

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:46.649
 1 1 played very short at the bottom not and not 

00:03:46.649 --> 00:03:49.699
 went to a resident 

00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:51.729
 we already have those that got worse 

00:03:51.729 --> 00:03:54.439
 seven matches without defeat 

00:03:54.439 --> 00:03:56.129
 I think that more 

00:03:56.129 --> 00:03:57.629
 can anyone supposedly 

00:03:57.629 --> 00:03:59.069
 whole 

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:02.069
 Lagging behind we do not believe that breakfast 

00:04:02.729 --> 00:04:05.009
 can't help but ask myself just about calling in 

00:04:05.009 --> 00:04:08.129
 team with what feelings took 

00:04:08.129 --> 00:04:10.819
 calmly accepted 

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:12.839
 not the first time in a season 

00:04:12.839 --> 00:04:15.029
 Here is an important match 

00:04:15.029 --> 00:04:17.449
 I don't know there 

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:20.689
 these two matches will determine who is his 

00:04:20.689 --> 00:04:23.150
 the balance of power will be clear basics house 2 and 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:26.139
 match all moments of particular shoot 

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:29.139
 how does he read that he played the challenge soon 

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:31.819
 if you notice that migrants
