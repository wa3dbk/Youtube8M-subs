another<00:01:39.080> very<00:01:39.200> effective<00:01:39.890> way<00:01:40.210> and<00:01:41.210> again

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:41.480 
another very effective way and again

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:43.030 
another very effective way and again
they're<00:01:41.840> going<00:01:41.960> to<00:01:42.020> hit<00:01:42.080> the<00:01:42.230> head<00:01:42.380> first<00:01:42.410> so

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:43.040 
they're going to hit the head first so

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:44.710 
they're going to hit the head first so
wait<00:01:43.220> an<00:01:43.370> extra<00:01:43.430> second<00:01:44.060> if<00:01:44.240> you<00:01:44.360> use<00:01:44.540> this

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:44.720 
wait an extra second if you use this

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:48.460 
wait an extra second if you use this
method<00:01:45.430> now<00:01:46.430> another<00:01:47.000> very<00:01:47.570> effective<00:01:47.720> method

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:48.470 
method now another very effective method

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:51.370 
method now another very effective method
is<00:01:49.060> to<00:01:50.060> go<00:01:50.210> just<00:01:50.540> straight<00:01:50.810> through<00:01:50.840> the<00:01:51.170> lips

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:51.380 
is to go just straight through the lips

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:53.860 
is to go just straight through the lips
just<00:01:51.830> go<00:01:52.070> right<00:01:52.250> underneath<00:01:52.580> the<00:01:53.450> chin<00:01:53.690> area

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:53.870 
just go right underneath the chin area

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:55.690 
just go right underneath the chin area
and<00:01:54.200> just<00:01:54.260> go<00:01:54.530> straight<00:01:54.800> up<00:01:54.860> through<00:01:55.190> both

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:55.700 
and just go straight up through both

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:56.800 
and just go straight up through both
lips<00:01:56.060> of<00:01:56.270> the<00:01:56.390> minnow

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:56.810 
lips of the minnow

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:59.080 
lips of the minnow
and<00:01:57.080> go<00:01:57.200> right<00:01:57.230> through<00:01:57.440> the<00:01:57.710> head<00:01:57.890> now<00:01:58.550> this

00:01:59.080 --> 00:01:59.090 
and go right through the head now this

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:01.600 
and go right through the head now this
is<00:01:59.300> very<00:01:59.570> effective<00:02:00.140> because<00:02:00.320> the<00:02:01.220> fish<00:02:01.460> are

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:01.610 
is very effective because the fish are

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:04.270 
is very effective because the fish are
going<00:02:01.730> to<00:02:01.790> hit<00:02:01.940> the<00:02:02.060> head<00:02:02.210> first<00:02:02.540> so<00:02:03.290> you<00:02:04.130> know

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:04.280 
going to hit the head first so you know

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:05.590 
going to hit the head first so you know
you're<00:02:04.460> going<00:02:04.580> to<00:02:04.640> have<00:02:04.760> to<00:02:04.910> pull<00:02:05.120> right<00:02:05.330> away

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:05.600 
you're going to have to pull right away

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:06.790 
you're going to have to pull right away
and<00:02:05.840> you're<00:02:05.990> going<00:02:06.110> to<00:02:06.140> have<00:02:06.290> a<00:02:06.320> good<00:02:06.530> chance

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:06.800 
and you're going to have a good chance

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:09.130 
and you're going to have a good chance
to<00:02:07.070> hook<00:02:07.640> that<00:02:07.850> fish<00:02:08.119> before<00:02:08.450> he<00:02:08.720> takes<00:02:08.960> your

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:09.140 
to hook that fish before he takes your

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:11.560 
to hook that fish before he takes your
bait<00:02:09.290> however<00:02:10.190> what<00:02:10.880> happens<00:02:11.270> is<00:02:11.420> because

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:11.570 
bait however what happens is because

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:13.900 
bait however what happens is because
you're<00:02:11.900> through<00:02:12.500> both<00:02:12.710> lips<00:02:13.010> the<00:02:13.730> minnow

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:13.910 
you're through both lips the minnow

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:17.740 
you're through both lips the minnow
won't<00:02:14.150> stay<00:02:14.710> alive<00:02:15.710> as<00:02:16.010> long<00:02:16.490> as<00:02:17.000> they<00:02:17.270> will<00:02:17.480> in

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:17.750 
won't stay alive as long as they will in

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:19.600 
won't stay alive as long as they will in
the<00:02:17.870> other<00:02:18.020> way<00:02:18.230> so<00:02:18.290> you<00:02:18.860> give<00:02:19.220> up<00:02:19.370> a<00:02:19.460> little

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:19.610 
the other way so you give up a little

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:21.730 
the other way so you give up a little
bit<00:02:19.850> of<00:02:19.970> that<00:02:20.150> with<00:02:20.450> this<00:02:20.660> method<00:02:20.870> but<00:02:21.500> again

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:21.740 
bit of that with this method but again

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:23.440 
bit of that with this method but again
very<00:02:22.010> very<00:02:22.220> effective<00:02:22.670> the<00:02:22.880> fish<00:02:23.060> hits<00:02:23.300> the

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450 
very very effective the fish hits the

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:26.080 
very very effective the fish hits the
head<00:02:23.600> first<00:02:23.870> good<00:02:24.620> chance<00:02:24.920> to<00:02:25.190> dock<00:02:25.610> that<00:02:25.820> fish

head first good chance to dock that fish

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:30.280 
head first good chance to dock that fish
now<00:02:26.750> another<00:02:27.200> very<00:02:27.980> effective<00:02:28.130> way<00:02:29.140> to<00:02:30.140> hook

now another very effective way to hook

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:33.040 
now another very effective way to hook
the<00:02:30.470> minnow<00:02:30.680> and<00:02:31.010> to<00:02:31.550> keep<00:02:31.730> it<00:02:31.910> Lively<00:02:32.390> this<00:02:32.870> is

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:33.050 
the minnow and to keep it Lively this is

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:34.990 
the minnow and to keep it Lively this is
one<00:02:33.200> of<00:02:33.320> Antonio's<00:02:33.830> favorite<00:02:34.250> ways<00:02:34.430> is<00:02:34.730> to

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:35.000 
one of Antonio's favorite ways is to

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.260 
one of Antonio's favorite ways is to
basically<00:02:35.840> take<00:02:36.230> your<00:02:36.410> minnow<00:02:36.650> and<00:02:37.130> go<00:02:37.910> just

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:38.270 
basically take your minnow and go just

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:40.840 
basically take your minnow and go just
in<00:02:38.600> front<00:02:38.959> of<00:02:39.050> the<00:02:39.200> eye<00:02:39.230> in<00:02:39.800> the<00:02:39.920> snow<00:02:40.190> area<00:02:40.459> and

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:40.850 
in front of the eye in the snow area and

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:42.790 
in front of the eye in the snow area and
just<00:02:41.060> go<00:02:41.180> through<00:02:41.540> that<00:02:41.570> area<00:02:42.170> and<00:02:42.350> then<00:02:42.560> out

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:42.800 
just go through that area and then out

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:46.000 
just go through that area and then out
the<00:02:43.550> mouth<00:02:43.730> just<00:02:44.209> like<00:02:44.390> so<00:02:44.660> so<00:02:45.470> now<00:02:45.709> what

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.010 
the mouth just like so so now what

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:48.430 
the mouth just like so so now what
happens<00:02:46.490> is<00:02:46.760> you're<00:02:47.360> not<00:02:47.540> closing<00:02:47.810> both<00:02:48.140> lips

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:48.440 
happens is you're not closing both lips

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:50.680 
happens is you're not closing both lips
you're<00:02:49.040> just<00:02:49.190> going<00:02:49.490> up<00:02:50.030> the<00:02:50.239> snow<00:02:50.480> and

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:50.690 
you're just going up the snow and

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:53.080 
you're just going up the snow and
through<00:02:51.110> the<00:02:51.320> mouth<00:02:51.530> so<00:02:52.160> now<00:02:52.370> the<00:02:52.430> minnow<00:02:52.730> can

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:53.090 
through the mouth so now the minnow can

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:56.350 
through the mouth so now the minnow can
move<00:02:53.720> around<00:02:53.959> freely<00:02:54.320> and<00:02:54.850> and<00:02:55.850> it's<00:02:56.180> got<00:02:56.330> a

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:56.360 
move around freely and and it's got a

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:01.180 
move around freely and and it's got a
good<00:02:56.650> a<00:02:57.650> good<00:02:58.640> solid<00:02:59.290> firm<00:03:00.290> setting<00:03:00.800> there<00:03:01.010> so

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:01.190 
good a good solid firm setting there so

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:02.380 
good a good solid firm setting there so
you're<00:03:01.310> not<00:03:01.400> going<00:03:01.550> to<00:03:01.640> lose<00:03:01.760> your<00:03:01.940> minnow<00:03:02.120> and

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:02.390 
you're not going to lose your minnow and

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:05.080 
you're not going to lose your minnow and
the<00:03:03.260> other<00:03:03.380> thing<00:03:03.650> is<00:03:03.830> the<00:03:04.340> bait<00:03:04.580> are<00:03:04.760> going<00:03:04.970> to

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:05.090 
the other thing is the bait are going to

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:06.729 
the other thing is the bait are going to
the<00:03:05.270> fish<00:03:05.420> are<00:03:05.600> going<00:03:05.750> to<00:03:05.840> hit<00:03:05.959> to<00:03:06.230> hit<00:03:06.590> the

00:03:06.729 --> 00:03:06.739 
the fish are going to hit to hit the

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:08.290 
the fish are going to hit to hit the
head<00:03:06.920> of<00:03:07.070> the<00:03:07.160> of<00:03:07.400> the<00:03:07.520> middle<00:03:07.790> so<00:03:08.180> you're

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:08.300 
head of the of the middle so you're

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:09.310 
head of the of the middle so you're
gonna<00:03:08.480> you're<00:03:08.810> going<00:03:08.930> to<00:03:08.989> have<00:03:09.080> a<00:03:09.140> good<00:03:09.260> chance

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:09.320 
gonna you're going to have a good chance

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:12.430 
gonna you're going to have a good chance
to<00:03:09.800> hook<00:03:10.310> that<00:03:10.489> fish<00:03:10.730> so<00:03:11.630> that's<00:03:11.959> very<00:03:12.230> very

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:12.440 
to hook that fish so that's very very

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:14.020 
to hook that fish so that's very very
effective<00:03:12.890> and<00:03:13.070> probably<00:03:13.520> one<00:03:13.670> of<00:03:13.700> the<00:03:13.820> best

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:14.030 
effective and probably one of the best

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:16.960 
effective and probably one of the best
because<00:03:14.300> it<00:03:14.690> keeps<00:03:14.840> the<00:03:15.050> middle<00:03:15.320> Lively<00:03:16.010> the

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:16.970 
because it keeps the middle Lively the

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:21.780 
because it keeps the middle Lively the
longest<00:03:17.709> one<00:03:18.970> last<00:03:19.970> method<00:03:20.390> if<00:03:20.540> you<00:03:20.780> have<00:03:20.989> dead

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:21.790 
longest one last method if you have dead

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:25.470 
longest one last method if you have dead
or<00:03:22.349> liveliness<00:03:23.349> isn't<00:03:23.830> an<00:03:24.610> issue<00:03:25.060> and<00:03:25.420> you
