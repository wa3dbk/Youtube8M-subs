00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.570
 Hello dear friends with you 

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:05.970
 gameplay my name is Yuri Aksenov and 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:06.420
 today will be mostly dark 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:09.450
 games 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:12.150
 probably connected with some riddles 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:14.309
 me but there will be some gonchki so 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.230
 what drove the first game called hound 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:18.539
 hardly this sequel is enough 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:21.119
 quality quest and how you see 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:24.800
 graphics this time became even cooler 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:27.900
 better but this time more developers 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:29.760
 well suited to the sound effect and 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.949
 for example when i played the first time me 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.980
 the volume was strong enough 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:37.649
 added on the phone and for a reason 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:40.500
 this I was very afraid of thunder 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:42.750
 which is very realistic here 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.629
 and and so what do we need to do here 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:48.809
 it's quite unusual here so here 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:50.280
 what do you need to bend by svayp of 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:54.090
 this one 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:56.699
 iron thing is a twig that us 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:59.399
 need, let's try it just once more 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:01.920
 bend back and after that we will be able to 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:05.519
 break off so for some reason did not work 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:07.920
 try again here's all twisted off a twig 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.630
 and now we can use it in 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.970
 one place 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:14.610
 but I specifically went a little bit to 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:17.159
 know what to do and not to blunt 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:19.920
 filming so insert by twig here 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:22.380
 here and now turn this lever 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.450
 and fall right down the well and right here 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:27.060
 here begins the most interesting now 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.900
 we will need to somehow get on 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.270
 surface 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.820
 the translation in the game is a bit clumsy but 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:36.420
 at least Russian is also in 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:40.409
 principle, you can understand the essence of the game 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:42.119
 plunge into my script and help 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:44.729
 our main character hold 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:47.670
 investigation of this mysterious house 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:50.909
 and find out what the hell is 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:52.740
 there is a qualitative quest interesting 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:55.439
 with many different puzzles 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:57.930
 which you have to solve as 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:02:00.810
 passing the second game is called 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:04.320
 four on four trophy this 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:05.729
 off-road racing I'm let's 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:08.520
 let's see leg here there are two modes 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:10.979
 games then freeride and company let's 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:13.739
 go to the company try to pass 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:16.650
 any mission hope we have it 

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:19.080
 succeed and now we can evaluate 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:20.790
 this toy is deservedly here to us 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.360
 need to choose a car on which we 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:23.880
 let's go 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:25.170
 there are plenty of them in principle 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:26.760
 must be unlocked 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:29.580
 and for this to go through a lot 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:31.500
 different missions missions what of yourself 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:35.340
 presents you need to drive on 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:38.010
 checkpoints and precisely due to this you and 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:40.500
 you will pass the data itself 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:42.299
 quests and win graphics in the game 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:45.660
 good enough control in 

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:47.610
 convenient principle and there is also a speedometer 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:47.870
 and all that is, you are such 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:51.290
 here 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:54.569
 convenient form you can drive to ride 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:57.360
 different such open roads 

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:59.790
 there are roads here as such there is no 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:01.739
 gps navigator that points you 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:05.299
 only direction and your task 

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:07.950
 drive through such checkpoints and 

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:09.870
 respectively reach the finish line 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:12.920
 but at first everything will be enough 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:15.450
 easy off-road will not be like that 

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:18.420
 boundless probably and then there will be 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:20.670
 this is now hardcore mess where 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:22.709
 Yeah, you can't drive the first time. 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:26.100
 you imagine to drive in almost 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:28.500
 sheer cliffs under up to 90 degrees and here 

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:30.329
 Now it will be really hard on it 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:32.880
 what we see now is in principle 

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:36.120
 driving is not that hard but fun 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:38.040
 after all the toy delivers enough 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:40.799
 a lot lately 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:43.680
 similar simulators are not more expensive but in my 

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:45.799
 look here this one probably from 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:48.230
 the highest quality and interesting 

00:03:45.799 --> 00:03:50.489
 I hope in the future something else 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:52.769
 more interesting out of the representatives 

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:54.989
 this genre as well to me very much 

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:57.840
 even like to drive off-road on 

00:03:54.989 --> 00:04:00.150
 There are such UAZ third game called 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:03.739
 mystery said in this game to you 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:07.739
 will need to escape from the castle and 

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:10.680
 accordingly find out what it is 

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:13.260
 such a game here is generally divided into 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:17.370
 rooms and the game is of itself 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:20.820
 genre room 100 shoots and that is, we 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:23.850
 looking for different clues hints and after 

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:26.580
 of this we can somehow escape from 

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:29.250
 this room and thanks to it go to 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:33.660
 the next mission in the game is quite a lot 

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:36.139
 and some kind of your own style and peculiar spirit 

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:39.750
 and the atmosphere in the game is present that is 

00:04:36.139 --> 00:04:41.100
 this is what distinguishes it from other games 

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:43.620
 of a similar genre 

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:46.340
 here there are digital codes that 

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:49.410
 you will need to enter to open 

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:52.710
 various doors and there raise 

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:54.870
 different things so let's see what 

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:58.830
 we have here here basically nothing 

00:04:54.870 --> 00:05:01.800
 so here is some kind of picture but to 

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:06.000
 take a picture we need to find something else 

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:08.610
 one so the chest is locked, that is us 

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:11.280
 does not fit so here basically burns 

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:13.560
 fire try to light a candle yes we have 

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:15.990
 it turned out and now we have 

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:18.780
 burning candle but what do we do with it 

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:21.000
 We only learn a little later as I have 

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:24.960
 said the graphics are rather unusual for 

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:27.000
 games of this genre and this is causing 

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:29.460
 interest so eighty five digits from us 

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:32.639
 appeared but what she will give us 

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:35.010
 you can probably only find out yourself 

00:05:32.639 --> 00:05:37.590
 after playing this game and guessing everything 

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:39.900
 riddles of this room and many many 

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:42.449
 other last game is called black 

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:43.110
 tower enigma in this game to you too 

00:05:42.449 --> 00:05:46.199
 is coming 

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:49.139
 run out of the rooms more accurately go up 

00:05:46.199 --> 00:05:51.330
 floors of the building's tower 

00:05:49.139 --> 00:05:53.460
 but this toy is like that 

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:55.680
 such an action performed in some 

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:58.280
 classic style and on each floor 

00:05:55.680 --> 00:06:01.440
 will attend their puzzles 

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:03.330
 deciding which you can open here 

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:06.030
 such here are the stairs and go 

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:09.750
 accordingly a level higher on the floor 

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:12.000
 there are also clues that are here 

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:16.080
 here there are reading them in principle can 

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:18.120
 will understand what is required of you 

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:20.219
 so here we are as you see there are 

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:22.120
 cubes and accordingly we need 

00:06:20.219 --> 00:06:24.460
 do something with them 

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:25.780
 need some numbers can put 

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:28.090
 be three sixes 

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:30.699
 also 3 hands alone unfortunately not 

00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:33.430
 triplets can be triggered and only 

00:06:30.699 --> 00:06:36.130
 then we can go to the floor above so 

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:39.430
 two sixes i did let's try 

00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:43.830
 one more and see what happens 

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:48.400
 but three sixes are number ominously enough 

00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:51.250
 scary yes actually this is it 

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:53.830
 go so that's easter girl that is when 

00:06:51.250 --> 00:06:57.490
 three sixes some kind of death comes and 

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:58.870
 trying to catch us let's try 

00:06:57.490 --> 00:07:01.510
 three triples enter 

00:06:58.870 --> 00:07:06.449
 To be honest, I already know what they are. 

00:07:01.510 --> 00:07:09.940
 you need to enter a pancake lick three 

00:07:06.449 --> 00:07:11.590
 so still C grade and then we will have 

00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:13.020
 the ladder with which we can 

00:07:11.590 --> 00:07:15.699
 go further 

00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:17.650
 why do I want to tell you the following 

00:07:15.699 --> 00:07:19.990
 mission want to demonstrate this for 

00:07:17.650 --> 00:07:22.090
 order to show what's on each 

00:07:19.990 --> 00:07:24.669
 puzzle floor will be enough 

00:07:22.090 --> 00:07:26.050
 varied and here we are written 

00:07:24.669 --> 00:07:29.380
 what we need to drive 

00:07:26.050 --> 00:07:31.870
 the ball in its designated position here 

00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:34.030
 this position but this one is a ball 

00:07:31.870 --> 00:07:36.490
 look he where you push he will 

00:07:34.030 --> 00:07:38.740
 go to the wall and in the end he 

00:07:36.490 --> 00:07:41.440
 will be at an impasse and you have to 

00:07:38.740 --> 00:07:43.150
 pereprohodit this level again but how 

00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:46.870
 you've probably already noticed here 

00:07:43.150 --> 00:07:48.729
 box and move in the box we 

00:07:46.870 --> 00:07:51.880
 we can basically quite easily 

00:07:48.729 --> 00:07:54.340
 pass this mission well, and how to pass 

00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:56.620
 The following mission you really do not think 

00:07:54.340 --> 00:07:58.060
 I want you to continue to spoil Well 

00:07:56.620 --> 00:07:59.979
 thank you very much for your attention 

00:07:58.060 --> 00:08:03.460
 subscribe to the channel do not forget 

00:07:59.979 --> 00:08:06.510
 put your finger up all bye luck 

00:08:03.460 --> 00:08:06.510
 and see you tomorrow
