00:00:12.039 --> 00:00:15.230
 hi everybody knows this quarter to 45 

00:00:14.119 --> 00:00:16.820
 and welcome to this new video 

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:20.030
 commented today we find ourselves 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:22.670
 for a challenge on black ops 2 then you 

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:24.440
 remember maybe a year ago I you 

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:27.080
 had also proposed a challenge on 

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:28.760
 modern warfare 3 which was to get a 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:30.080
 ripper without making it good 

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:32.329
 today I present to you the following of 

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:34.220
 this challenge that is getting a lot of stars 

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:35.300
 so the equivalent of a reaper even though I 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:36.050
 find that the author is a little bit 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:39.710
 better I do not know what you think 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:41.120
 you ben on black ops of good the method 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:43.340
 a little bit changed since bac like 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:44.780
 you probably know the system 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:48.050
 getting killstreaks scores 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:50.930
 frikha has changed we get I find 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:53.149
 one in our challenge it was I found 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:55.550
 easier to get the tarn lot 

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:56.930
 simply because if you 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:58.399
 remember to do too much 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:59.960
 had to take positions of 

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:01.700
 domination for example to raise 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:03.230
 the series of points and suddenly take 9 

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:05.239
 dominance position it was enough 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:08.060
 long and the displacements were rather 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:09.590
 risky so down there it was enough for me 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:11.270
 simply in confirmed eliminations 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:13.159
 for example to go pick up the 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:15.200
 medals that my teammates left by 

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:16.040
 earth to finally opt to do 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.570
 to assemble my series of points 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:20.420
 so there are some youtuber who have 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:22.190
 already realized similar challenges so 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:23.479
 there is my mafioso mate the rates that has 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:25.850
 got hunting groups doing 

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:28.909
 this technique the tail and then also 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:31.760
 line 75 years it seems to me so that's 

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:33.979
 nothing new a jump is sure to stay 

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:36.290
 just right ben that's story presented the 

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:38.210
 following this challenge and therefore the blow hard 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:40.880
 during this challenge actually we were in 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:42.770
 live on my youtube channel live and 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:45.290
 then the audience could we 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:46.700
 look to be realized this challenge 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:49.840
 the same time we are playing 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:51.920
 what is it nice enough 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:53.870
 and then here is what you see 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:55.820
 in fact I recorded while 

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:57.320
 I was streaming and I 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:58.910
 recorded what was going on the gameplay 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:59.840
 there are even the ways that gb is a 

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:00.710
 little bit are so that's why 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:04.190
 you may have heard a little 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:05.060
 few indications of the voices a not very 

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:08.830
 strong but you may have them 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:10.670
 hear a little bit and then so here 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:12.050
 what am I going to say add 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:14.750
 others I know more I'll maybe 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:16.160
 to talk to you a little bit about my class and 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:17.240
 Eggs must still that I 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:19.820
 thank my teammates who 

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:22.370
 accompanied during this challenge so I 

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:24.620
 thank this pebble it high toox gay 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:25.910
 china estelle yuki and mantallot of 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:27.980
 to have accompanied me because without them 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:30.350
 obviously stop much harder 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:32.090
 you finally got yourself the same forgiveness 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:33.230
 you imagine me well in the process of 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:34.820
 walk around the map to look for 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:36.709
 medals and as soon as I find myself facing 

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:37.160
 a low enemy no no one for 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:39.140
 lean 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:42.020
 it would have been really hard to 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:43.340
 to be able to realize the challenge so the same 

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:44.600
 if it was the first attempt so we 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:45.739
 was not very well organized it's 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:47.090
 for that you really accelerate 

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:48.890
 the whole first part because ben 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:50.239
 it was rather boring because I 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:52.310
 did that to die young I had 

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:54.650
 some drones but that's it 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:55.850
 does not really go much further and 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:57.049
 So here it's going to start 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:03:00.170
 become interesting is this part 

00:02:57.049 --> 00:03:01.820
 there so well yes it was actually time 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:03.950
 we start to organize ourselves 

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:07.910
 it is that our group is well ground 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:09.709
 what is the convoy there and once 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:11.900
 this break-in was done that was a lot 

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:14.600
 simpler to achieve the challenge and 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:16.190
 you will see that beats we will get this 

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:19.430
 lot store really very quickly a 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:20.900
 time it's going to be gone that you see 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:22.190
 there I have teammates around me 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:23.630
 we are in the middle of the map 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:25.459
 so crossing point had to I 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:26.750
 be very careful I liked when 

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:29.110
 even my shield for the pumps 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:31.340
 cover but the shield 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:32.989
 how to say he really lets it go 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:34.010
 finally live sometimes he passes 

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:34.970
 bullets it's a bit weird there is 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:36.079
 to whom I have the impression that they 

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:38.540
 was doing wahlberg is nothing 

00:03:36.079 --> 00:03:39.799
 shield sometimes good it was surely due 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:40.940
 I think because as I was in 

00:03:39.799 --> 00:03:42.290
 streamed train 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:44.480
 I was doing the live in 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:45.800
 same time i think i surely had 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:48.200
 a small shift from the war a little 

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:49.190
 little is normal and suddenly it's for 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:50.690
 that I had the impression of myself 

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:51.980
 take wahlberg with the shield 

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:53.000
 but in fact it was just that I had 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:55.580
 a little as soon as a little time of 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.870
 shift what so yes but this body 

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:58.610
 strict are also important the 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:00.020
 drone and microstation you see 

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:02.930
 the ulster been obtained you saw that has 

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:04.340
 been very fast very fast so I 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:07.940
 think we will try more challenges 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:09.820
 elevated finally has already tried them but I 

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:13.460
 will you propose them soon 

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:14.930
 so yes the drone and the microstation 

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:16.910
 was very important because 

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:18.680
 brought little more assistance 

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:21.739
 which is not a big thing a 10 points 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:23.840
 15 points but it really counts in 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:24.950
 the series of points and you saw that 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:27.110
 as soon as I got the microstation 

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:29.870
 it was really really fast yes the 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:31.010
 June + 90 without doing anything just right 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:33.170
 with my teammates who made some 

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:35.630
 frags so week is still very 

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:37.610
 interesting and I think this 

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:39.710
 technique if you have very good ones 

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:41.300
 good friends bankers teammates and 

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:43.310
 if you have trouble getting scores 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:44.960
 strict and well get strict scores 

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:46.550
 this way it's not very very hard to 

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:47.150
 this challenge we did it the first time 

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:49.880
 tell you well 

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:51.230
 so here I think if you have some 

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:53.030
 wrong to get strict scores that can 

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:54.890
 to be one maybe it's not the 

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:57.850
 best method but it can be 

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:59.960
 nice what may it help you maybe 

00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:03.470
 by trying like that so I you 

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:04.970
 advise to try if ever so bah 

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:07.310
 here I launch my reaper what 

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:08.300
 can return almost and ratio 

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:10.580
 because I'm still dead 

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:12.680
 a lot of times while I was doing the 

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:14.810
 attempt I'm going to make a score of 10 to 

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:16.250
 11 to finish even though I had done a 

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:17.510
 once I believe in returning a 

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:18.680
 grenade I was hungry they 

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:20.780
 unfortunately but you do not know 

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:22.430
 counted in the series that had allowed me 

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:24.830
 to get the lot of stars so everything goes 

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:26.210
 well the challenge is validated thank you 

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:27.530
 to have watched this video so there is 

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:29.180
 other challenges with other money scoring 

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:30.230
 who will arrive very soon I 

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:32.290
 tell you very soon hi all the 

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:32.290
 world
