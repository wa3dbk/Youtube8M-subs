buttons<00:01:29.220> on<00:01:29.340> it<00:01:29.369> and<00:01:29.520> so<00:01:30.210> what<00:01:30.840> I've<00:01:30.930> done<00:01:31.110> here

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
buttons on it and so what I've done here

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.740 
buttons on it and so what I've done here
is<00:01:31.560> it's<00:01:31.979> going<00:01:32.100> to<00:01:32.159> x2<00:01:32.369> this<00:01:32.460> out<00:01:32.689> all<00:01:33.689> of

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
is it's going to x2 this out all of

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.370 
is it's going to x2 this out all of
these<00:01:34.350> events<00:01:35.159> have<00:01:35.400> you<00:01:35.490> going<00:01:35.670> to<00:01:35.729> the<00:01:35.820> code

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:36.380 
these events have you going to the code

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:38.450 
these events have you going to the code
correspond<00:01:37.380> with<00:01:37.680> these<00:01:37.890> sprites<00:01:38.070> over<00:01:38.280> here

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
correspond with these sprites over here

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.539 
correspond with these sprites over here
so<00:01:38.670> when<00:01:39.509> you<00:01:39.540> go<00:01:39.750> left<00:01:40.049> on<00:01:40.380> your<00:01:40.860> gamepad<00:01:41.280> or

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
so when you go left on your gamepad or

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.069 
so when you go left on your gamepad or
joystick<00:01:42.240> for<00:01:42.360> anyone<00:01:42.570> who<00:01:42.630> actually<00:01:42.780> still

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
joystick for anyone who actually still

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:45.350 
joystick for anyone who actually still
has<00:01:43.320> sent<00:01:43.560> me<00:01:43.619> one<00:01:43.770> of<00:01:43.799> those<00:01:44.360> you're

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
has sent me one of those you're

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.240 
has sent me one of those you're
basically<00:01:45.720> going<00:01:45.899> to<00:01:46.020> have<00:01:46.649> this<00:01:46.829> right<00:01:47.100> here

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
basically going to have this right here

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.609 
basically going to have this right here
that's<00:01:47.490> nothing<00:01:47.850> sprite<00:01:48.149> right<00:01:48.840> here<00:01:49.020> changed

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
that's nothing sprite right here changed

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:52.429 
that's nothing sprite right here changed
to<00:01:49.860> the<00:01:50.100> left<00:01:50.579> sprite<00:01:50.880> right<00:01:51.149> here<00:01:51.360> so<00:01:52.020> that's

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
to the left sprite right here so that's

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:53.660 
to the left sprite right here so that's
pretty<00:01:52.590> much<00:01:52.680> how<00:01:52.890> this<00:01:53.009> works<00:01:53.220> I<00:01:53.399> think<00:01:53.579> you

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
pretty much how this works I think you

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.880 
pretty much how this works I think you
guys<00:01:53.790> pretty<00:01:54.240> much<00:01:54.390> get<00:01:54.570> to<00:01:54.600> just<00:01:55.020> of<00:01:55.200> how

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
guys pretty much get to just of how

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.010 
guys pretty much get to just of how
everything<00:01:56.189> plays<00:01:56.610> out<00:01:56.850> basically<00:01:57.240> depending

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
everything plays out basically depending

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.819 
everything plays out basically depending
on<00:01:58.170> what<00:01:58.530> button<00:01:58.890> you<00:01:59.009> press<00:01:59.719> will<00:02:00.829> basically

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
on what button you press will basically

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:04.249 
on what button you press will basically
change<00:02:02.460> the<00:02:02.610> sprite<00:02:03.119> from<00:02:03.689> there's<00:02:04.020> nothing

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
change the sprite from there's nothing

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:06.050 
change the sprite from there's nothing
one<00:02:04.439> to<00:02:04.799> the<00:02:04.950> one<00:02:05.040> over<00:02:05.189> here<00:02:05.399> and<00:02:05.610> it's

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
one to the one over here and it's

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.260 
one to the one over here and it's
labeled<00:02:06.570> so<00:02:06.930> when<00:02:07.649> you<00:02:07.770> press<00:02:07.979> like<00:02:08.310> say<00:02:08.580> I'm

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
labeled so when you press like say I'm

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.839 
labeled so when you press like say I'm
using<00:02:09.450> an<00:02:09.599> Xbox<00:02:09.840> gamepad<00:02:10.289> a<00:02:10.679> USB<00:02:11.039> gamepad<00:02:11.190> when

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
using an Xbox gamepad a USB gamepad when

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:12.980 
using an Xbox gamepad a USB gamepad when
I<00:02:11.879> press<00:02:12.090> the<00:02:12.239> B<00:02:12.420> key

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
it's going to go to a red block and let

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.360 
it's going to go to a red block and let
me<00:02:15.780> go<00:02:15.870> ahead<00:02:15.900> and<00:02:16.140> really<00:02:16.710> quickly<00:02:16.890> run<00:02:17.220> this

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
me go ahead and really quickly run this

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:06.570 
use the triggers you're kind of out of

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:08.330 
use the triggers you're kind of out of
luck<00:03:06.810> there<00:03:07.080> but<00:03:07.680> you<00:03:07.740> could<00:03:07.800> also<00:03:07.950> use<00:03:08.070> these

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
luck there but you could also use these

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:10.130 
luck there but you could also use these
start<00:03:08.730> and<00:03:08.940> I<00:03:09.300> just<00:03:09.450> called<00:03:09.630> it<00:03:09.750> back<00:03:09.930> here

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140 
start and I just called it back here

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:11.960 
start and I just called it back here
because<00:03:10.320> if<00:03:10.530> you<00:03:11.070> select<00:03:11.490> it<00:03:11.640> might<00:03:11.760> look<00:03:11.910> the

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:11.970 
because if you select it might look the

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:14.240 
because if you select it might look the
same<00:03:12.210> as<00:03:12.360> start<00:03:12.630> but<00:03:13.440> anyway<00:03:13.680> start<00:03:14.010> and

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250 
same as start but anyway start and

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:17.090 
same as start but anyway start and
select<00:03:14.610> so<00:03:15.090> I'm<00:03:15.840> not<00:03:16.050> necessarily<00:03:16.770> going<00:03:16.950> to

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:17.100 
select so I'm not necessarily going to

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:19.310 
select so I'm not necessarily going to
go<00:03:17.430> over<00:03:17.910> like<00:03:18.240> go<00:03:18.390> back<00:03:18.570> to<00:03:18.630> the<00:03:18.750> example<00:03:19.140> and

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:19.320 
go over like go back to the example and

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:20.690 
go over like go back to the example and
go<00:03:19.560> over<00:03:19.740> what<00:03:19.770> everything<00:03:20.190> does<00:03:20.220> because<00:03:20.610> you

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700 
go over what everything does because you

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:22.790 
go over what everything does because you
might<00:03:20.910> have<00:03:21.060> to<00:03:21.120> change<00:03:21.510> it<00:03:21.660> according<00:03:22.140> to<00:03:22.170> how

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:22.800 
might have to change it according to how

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:24.650 
might have to change it according to how
your<00:03:22.950> controller<00:03:23.280> set<00:03:23.520> up<00:03:23.670> but<00:03:24.180> that's

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:24.660 
your controller set up but that's

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:26.330 
your controller set up but that's
essentially<00:03:25.020> how<00:03:25.230> it<00:03:25.260> works<00:03:25.500> so<00:03:25.830> you<00:03:25.890> know<00:03:26.160> all

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 
essentially how it works so you know all

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:27.860 
essentially how it works so you know all
those<00:03:26.520> joypad<00:03:26.970> controls<00:03:27.390> I<00:03:27.570> showed<00:03:27.750> you

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870 
those joypad controls I showed you

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:30.590 
those joypad controls I showed you
events<00:03:28.440> are<00:03:28.610> basically<00:03:29.610> what<00:03:29.970> control<00:03:30.390> your

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:30.600 
events are basically what control your

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:33.970 
events are basically what control your
joypad<00:03:30.990> /<00:03:31.580> joystick<00:03:32.580> or<00:03:32.610> gamepad<00:03:32.790> yeah

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:33.980 
joypad / joystick or gamepad yeah

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:36.050 
joypad / joystick or gamepad yeah
totally<00:03:34.980> getting<00:03:35.220> just<00:03:35.400> confused<00:03:35.880> with<00:03:35.970> all
