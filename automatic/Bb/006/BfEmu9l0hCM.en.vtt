00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:07.470
 Hello dear children 

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:23.279
 Let's start with a new adventure 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:25.680
 does baby flitzer head the tractor free 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:29.760
 and will be happy by the village hello 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:31.099
 tractor tractor including what a beautiful 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:40.170
 butterfly 

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:42.980
 that definitely tickles the butterfly 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.980
 luckily it works well 

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:48.230
 The tractor slides directly into the fence 

00:00:46.219 --> 00:00:53.059
 hopefully the tractor will not work 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:54.739
 hurts what happens now this 

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:56.510
 do not spit 

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:58.909
 But then took advantage of the opportunity 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:03.820
 and turns off the dust 

00:00:58.909 --> 00:01:07.340
 the rascal sharp where do you want to go 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:11.869
 that on the mountain steep and slippery 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:14.170
 oh the sheep does not seem to us anymore 

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:14.170
 to listen 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:28.460
 hopefully nothing will happen to him without it 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:31.640
 sharp slipped but good that the 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:33.649
 tractor still close by is fast 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:34.700
 Tractor go with the fire 

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:36.619
 get a long ladder 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:39.670
 she can be certain from the 

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:39.670
 ledge would 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:47.509
 pity the ladder is too short but the 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:49.280
 tractor already has a new idea and 

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:51.979
 call another friend 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:54.770
 the helicopter is already starting 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:56.950
 that's the one with his line network 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:56.950
 solution 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:03.510
 Well hold on sharp you will be saved 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:08.940
 helicopter you come but quite nice 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:08.940
 into a sweat 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:14.050
 it is done the same 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:16.480
 fortunately, united forces still exist 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:18.730
 Everything went well and the sheep is 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:21.880
 again safe in his herd 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:24.480
