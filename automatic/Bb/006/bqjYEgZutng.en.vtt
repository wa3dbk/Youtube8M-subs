read your temperature to find out a few

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:16.010 
read your temperature to find out a few
of<00:01:12.900> a<00:01:12.960> fever<00:01:13.260> I'm<00:01:13.880> fairly<00:01:14.880> certain<00:01:15.150> that<00:01:15.689> ours

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
of a fever I'm fairly certain that ours

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.160 
of a fever I'm fairly certain that ours
is<00:01:16.259> broken<00:01:17.299> just<00:01:18.299> for<00:01:18.450> the<00:01:18.509> fact<00:01:18.659> that<00:01:18.840> it

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
is broken just for the fact that it

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.399 
is broken just for the fact that it
feels<00:01:19.500> like<00:01:19.680> any<00:01:19.950> time<00:01:20.220> mallar<00:01:20.490> I<00:01:21.170> feel<00:01:22.170> that

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
feels like any time mallar I feel that

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.580 
feels like any time mallar I feel that
we<00:01:22.590> have<00:01:22.619> a<00:01:22.860> fever<00:01:23.360> we<00:01:24.360> check<00:01:24.810> our<00:01:25.020> temperature

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
we have a fever we check our temperature

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.950 
we have a fever we check our temperature
and<00:01:25.770> it's<00:01:25.890> always<00:01:26.130> low<00:01:27.000> and<00:01:27.420> that's<00:01:27.630> like<00:01:27.810> it

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
and it's always low and that's like it

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.710 
and it's always low and that's like it
just<00:01:28.140> doesn't<00:01:28.500> feel<00:01:28.680> right<00:01:28.740> like<00:01:29.220> it<00:01:29.340> happens

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:29.720 
just doesn't feel right like it happens

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.120 
just doesn't feel right like it happens
consistently<00:01:30.720> every<00:01:30.869> time<00:01:31.200> and<00:01:31.409> I<00:01:31.560> know<00:01:31.890> that

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
consistently every time and I know that

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:33.950 
consistently every time and I know that
sometimes<00:01:32.610> people's<00:01:33.270> internal<00:01:33.780> body

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
sometimes people's internal body

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.600 
sometimes people's internal body
temperatures<00:01:34.409> can<00:01:34.650> be<00:01:34.680> a<00:01:34.829> little<00:01:35.040> off<00:01:35.310> you

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
temperatures can be a little off you

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.940 
temperatures can be a little off you
know<00:01:35.729> they<00:01:36.119> say<00:01:36.170> 98.6<00:01:37.170> is<00:01:37.350> like<00:01:37.500> super<00:01:37.770> healthy

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
know they say 98.6 is like super healthy

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.260 
know they say 98.6 is like super healthy
but<00:01:38.189> some<00:01:38.369> people<00:01:38.610> i<00:01:38.700> think<00:01:38.729> run<00:01:39.090> a<00:01:39.119> little

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
but some people i think run a little

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.780 
but some people i think run a little
cold<00:01:39.600> or<00:01:39.780> hot<00:01:39.930> or<00:01:39.990> whatever<00:01:40.350> and<00:01:40.829> i<00:01:41.400> think<00:01:41.640> that

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
cold or hot or whatever and i think that

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.960 
cold or hot or whatever and i think that
maybe<00:01:41.909> we<00:01:42.180> do<00:01:42.420> run<00:01:42.869> a<00:01:42.930> little<00:01:43.250> colder<00:01:44.250> normally

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
maybe we do run a little colder normally

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.020 
maybe we do run a little colder normally
but<00:01:45.869> still<00:01:46.259> I<00:01:46.290> mean<00:01:46.590> now<00:01:46.890> earlier<00:01:47.369> was<00:01:47.790> like

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
but still I mean now earlier was like

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.969 
but still I mean now earlier was like
really<00:01:48.540> burning<00:01:49.049> up<00:01:49.200> and<00:01:49.380> the<00:01:49.439> thermometer

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
really burning up and the thermometer

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.340 
really burning up and the thermometer
just<00:01:50.159> did<00:01:50.399> not<00:01:50.640> say<00:01:51.570> that<00:01:51.600> anything<00:01:52.049> was<00:01:52.259> wrong

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
just did not say that anything was wrong

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.929 
just did not say that anything was wrong
it<00:01:52.680> was<00:01:52.799> like<00:01:52.890> 98.2<00:01:53.790> or<00:01:54.270> something<00:01:54.890> so<00:01:55.890> I<00:01:56.399> don't

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
it was like 98.2 or something so I don't

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:59.120 
it was like 98.2 or something so I don't
know<00:01:57.060> she<00:01:57.180> felt<00:01:57.570> hot<00:01:57.750> and<00:01:58.020> she<00:01:58.649> just<00:01:58.860> didn't

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
know she felt hot and she just didn't

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:00.469 
know she felt hot and she just didn't
feel<00:01:59.250> very<00:01:59.280> good<00:01:59.490> today<00:01:59.610> she's<00:02:00.090> definitely
