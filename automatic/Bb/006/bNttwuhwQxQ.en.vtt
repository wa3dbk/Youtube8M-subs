00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.249 
sucking to the engine left the spark
plugs<00:01:37.860> in<00:01:38.040> place<00:01:38.280> as<00:01:38.549> you<00:01:38.729> can<00:01:39.000> see<00:01:39.180> and<00:01:40.110> then

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
plugs in place as you can see and then

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:43.550 
plugs in place as you can see and then
the<00:01:40.350> two<00:01:41.119> bolts<00:01:42.119> that<00:01:42.329> actually<00:01:42.780> connect<00:01:43.439> the

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
the two bolts that actually connect the

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.679 
the two bolts that actually connect the
valve<00:01:43.740> cover<00:01:44.070> excuse<00:01:44.909> me<00:01:45.030> the<00:01:45.119> timing<00:01:45.479> cover

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
valve cover excuse me the timing cover

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.719 
valve cover excuse me the timing cover
to<00:01:46.380> that<00:01:46.530> I<00:01:46.560> also<00:01:46.829> removed<00:01:47.220> and<00:01:47.399> I<00:01:47.430> have<00:01:47.579> those

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
to that I also removed and I have those

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.840 
to that I also removed and I have those
set<00:01:47.909> aside<00:01:48.180> so<00:01:48.570> I<00:01:48.600> don't<00:01:48.869> I<00:01:49.140> don't<00:01:49.290> lose<00:01:49.590> those

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:49.850 
set aside so I don't I don't lose those

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:52.550 
set aside so I don't I don't lose those
so<00:01:50.850> that's<00:01:50.939> where<00:01:51.149> I'm<00:01:51.240> at<00:01:51.299> right<00:01:51.360> now<00:01:51.560> and

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
so that's where I'm at right now and

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.410 
so that's where I'm at right now and
what<00:01:52.619> I'll<00:01:53.130> do<00:01:53.250> is<00:01:53.399> when<00:01:53.549> I<00:01:53.579> actually<00:01:54.119> go<00:01:54.360> ahead

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
what I'll do is when I actually go ahead

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.480 
what I'll do is when I actually go ahead
and<00:01:54.600> start<00:01:54.720> removing<00:01:54.840> that<00:01:55.140> bypass<00:01:55.590> tube<00:01:55.890> I'll

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
and start removing that bypass tube I'll

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.139 
and start removing that bypass tube I'll
show<00:01:56.759> you<00:01:56.820> one<00:01:57.509> thing<00:01:57.630> to<00:01:57.780> note<00:01:57.960> is<00:01:58.829> the<00:01:59.369> torque

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
show you one thing to note is the torque

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:03.620 
show you one thing to note is the torque
sequence<00:02:00.630> on<00:02:00.930> on<00:02:01.619> those<00:02:01.969> valve<00:02:02.969> covers<00:02:03.390> are

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
sequence on on those valve covers are

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.719 
sequence on on those valve covers are
actually

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
actually

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:09.109 
actually
specific<00:02:06.630> for<00:02:06.930> this<00:02:07.049> car<00:02:08.459> this<00:02:08.849> particular

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
specific for this car this particular

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:10.999 
specific for this car this particular
car<00:02:09.450> how<00:02:10.110> good<00:02:10.289> you<00:02:10.349> could<00:02:10.470> actually<00:02:10.590> see<00:02:10.860> this

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
car how good you could actually see this

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:14.210 
car how good you could actually see this
but<00:02:11.910> there's<00:02:12.569> the<00:02:12.750> sequence<00:02:13.110> for<00:02:13.500> one<00:02:14.010> of<00:02:14.130> the

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 
but there's the sequence for one of the

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:16.400 
but there's the sequence for one of the
banks<00:02:14.550> this<00:02:15.060> is<00:02:15.120> the<00:02:15.390> right<00:02:15.599> hand<00:02:15.780> bank<00:02:16.080> so

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
banks this is the right hand bank so

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:19.790 
banks this is the right hand bank so
this<00:02:16.530> would<00:02:16.650> be<00:02:16.739> the<00:02:16.830> bank<00:02:17.040> that<00:02:17.550> has<00:02:17.910> the<00:02:18.800> does

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
this would be the bank that has the does

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.470 
this would be the bank that has the does
it<00:02:19.860> not<00:02:19.950> have<00:02:20.099> the<00:02:20.220> oil<00:02:20.400> cap<00:02:20.670> on<00:02:20.910> it<00:02:21.060> and<00:02:21.270> this

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
it not have the oil cap on it and this

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:22.790 
it not have the oil cap on it and this
is<00:02:21.630> the<00:02:21.660> order<00:02:22.050> in<00:02:22.200> which<00:02:22.260> you<00:02:22.650> need<00:02:22.739> to

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 
is the order in which you need to

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:24.290 
is the order in which you need to
tighten<00:02:23.069> them<00:02:23.160> down<00:02:23.190> and<00:02:23.850> I<00:02:23.940> just<00:02:24.120> wrote<00:02:24.270> down

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300 
tighten them down and I just wrote down

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:28.580 
tighten them down and I just wrote down
43<00:02:25.050> to<00:02:25.290> 46<00:02:25.770> inch<00:02:26.190> pounds<00:02:26.850> of<00:02:27.060> torque<00:02:27.690> and<00:02:28.500> you

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
43 to 46 inch pounds of torque and you

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:30.830 
43 to 46 inch pounds of torque and you
do<00:02:28.680> that<00:02:28.830> in<00:02:28.950> three<00:02:29.220> steps<00:02:29.520> all<00:02:30.270> right<00:02:30.420> so<00:02:30.630> one

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
do that in three steps all right so one

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.199 
do that in three steps all right so one
two<00:02:31.020> three<00:02:31.350> pattern<00:02:32.340> and<00:02:32.760> then<00:02:33.000> the<00:02:33.090> other

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:33.209 
two three pattern and then the other

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:36.380 
two three pattern and then the other
side<00:02:34.310> same<00:02:35.310> idea<00:02:35.700> this<00:02:35.880> is<00:02:36.030> the<00:02:36.120> left-hand

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
side same idea this is the left-hand

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.920 
side same idea this is the left-hand
Bank

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
Bank

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:39.110 
Bank
that's<00:02:37.590> the<00:02:37.800> order<00:02:38.100> just<00:02:38.640> in<00:02:38.730> case<00:02:38.880> you<00:02:39.030> guys

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
that's the order just in case you guys

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:40.180 
that's the order just in case you guys
don't<00:02:39.300> have<00:02:39.390> access<00:02:39.780> to<00:02:39.930> this<00:02:40.019> information

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:40.190 
don't have access to this information

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:42.680 
don't have access to this information
just<00:02:41.190> want<00:02:41.370> to<00:02:41.459> show<00:02:41.610> you<00:02:41.670> that<00:02:41.819> the<00:02:42.300> order<00:02:42.540> for

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
just want to show you that the order for

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:43.820 
just want to show you that the order for
the<00:02:42.750> left-hand<00:02:43.140> bank<00:02:43.290> and<00:02:43.410> that's<00:02:43.470> the<00:02:43.650> side

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:43.830 
the left-hand bank and that's the side

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:46.580 
the left-hand bank and that's the side
that's<00:02:44.040> going<00:02:44.190> to<00:02:44.250> have<00:02:44.430> the<00:02:45.140> PVC<00:02:46.140> valve<00:02:46.350> in<00:02:46.500> it

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
that's going to have the PVC valve in it

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:49.519 
that's going to have the PVC valve in it
and<00:02:46.830> also<00:02:46.980> the<00:02:47.280> oil
