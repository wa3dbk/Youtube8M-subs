here's my bluetooth earpiece I just
layered<00:02:37.860> a<00:02:38.040> bunch<00:02:38.220> of<00:02:38.370> little<00:02:38.489> bits<00:02:38.790> of<00:02:38.910> foam

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
layered a bunch of little bits of foam

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.199 
layered a bunch of little bits of foam
on<00:02:39.390> it<00:02:39.450> that's<00:02:40.260> pretty<00:02:40.500> much<00:02:40.739> it<00:02:41.010> it'll<00:02:41.790> have<00:02:41.970> a

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:42.209 
on it that's pretty much it it'll have a

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:44.479 
on it that's pretty much it it'll have a
blue<00:02:42.630> LED<00:02:42.840> light<00:02:43.349> in<00:02:43.500> it<00:02:43.620> eventually<00:02:43.920> and

00:02:44.479 --> 00:02:44.489 
blue LED light in it eventually and

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:47.000 
blue LED light in it eventually and
it'll<00:02:45.030> make<00:02:45.180> a<00:02:45.209> wrap<00:02:45.510> around<00:02:45.540> ear<00:02:46.319> attachment

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
it'll make a wrap around ear attachment

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:48.920 
it'll make a wrap around ear attachment
so<00:02:47.160> this<00:02:47.310> fits<00:02:47.549> on<00:02:47.700> my<00:02:47.819> ear<00:02:48.060> just<00:02:48.299> like<00:02:48.569> this
