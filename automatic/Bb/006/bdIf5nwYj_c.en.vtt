if<00:00:10.679> you<00:00:10.860> want<00:00:11.099> to<00:00:11.280> get<00:00:11.550> better<00:00:11.929> bit<00:00:12.929> of

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
if you want to get better bit of

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:14.539 
if you want to get better bit of
penetration<00:00:13.559> then<00:00:13.980> you<00:00:14.099> use<00:00:14.219> the<00:00:14.370> cosmetic

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
penetration then you use the cosmetic

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:17.870 
penetration then you use the cosmetic
role<00:00:15.059> kit<00:00:15.299> because<00:00:16.260> medic<00:00:16.740> role<00:00:16.949> kit<00:00:17.190> is<00:00:17.520> going

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
role kit because medic role kit is going

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.320 
role kit because medic role kit is going
to<00:00:18.029> give<00:00:18.270> you<00:00:18.420> as<00:00:18.690> much<00:00:19.170> penetration<00:00:19.949> and<00:00:20.699> as

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
to give you as much penetration and as

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.599 
to give you as much penetration and as
higher<00:00:21.869> dose<00:00:22.380> as<00:00:22.650> you<00:00:23.640> probably<00:00:24.000> can<00:00:24.630> get<00:00:24.960> I

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:25.609 
higher dose as you probably can get I

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:29.210 
higher dose as you probably can get I
thought<00:00:26.609> if<00:00:26.789> I<00:00:26.970> make<00:00:27.210> the<00:00:27.449> role<00:00:28.080> kit<00:00:28.410> because

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
thought if I make the role kit because

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.389 
thought if I make the role kit because
already<00:00:29.460> had<00:00:30.470> designed<00:00:31.470> the<00:00:31.679> role<00:00:31.920> kit<00:00:32.189> and

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
already had designed the role kit and

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.970 
already had designed the role kit and
made<00:00:32.579> the<00:00:32.850> role<00:00:33.030> kit<00:00:33.410> years<00:00:34.410> before<00:00:34.770> that<00:00:34.950> I

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
made the role kit years before that I

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.639 
made the role kit years before that I
thought<00:00:35.280> I'd<00:00:35.399> just<00:00:35.579> shorten<00:00:36.000> the<00:00:36.120> needles<00:00:36.649> and

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
thought I'd just shorten the needles and

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.260 
thought I'd just shorten the needles and
I<00:00:37.770> showed<00:00:38.010> them<00:00:38.219> to<00:00:38.250> zero<00:00:38.670> point<00:00:38.910> two

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
I showed them to zero point two

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.920 
I showed them to zero point two
millimeters<00:00:40.140> and<00:00:40.379> then<00:00:40.910> only<00:00:41.910> a<00:00:42.149> fraction<00:00:42.600> of

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
millimeters and then only a fraction of

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.830 
millimeters and then only a fraction of
the<00:00:43.140> needle<00:00:43.500> will<00:00:44.160> get<00:00:44.399> into<00:00:44.730> the<00:00:44.879> skin<00:00:45.149> and<00:00:45.510> I

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
the needle will get into the skin and I

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.220 
the needle will get into the skin and I
just<00:00:45.980> want<00:00:46.980> to<00:00:47.219> puncture<00:00:47.840> the<00:00:48.840> stratum

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
just want to puncture the stratum

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.290 
just want to puncture the stratum
corneum<00:00:50.449> anyway<00:00:51.449> so<00:00:51.510> that's<00:00:52.079> changed

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:53.300 
corneum anyway so that's changed

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:56.150 
corneum anyway so that's changed
skincare<00:00:54.300> as<00:00:54.539> we<00:00:54.780> know<00:00:54.960> it<00:00:55.110> because<00:00:55.710> we<00:00:55.739> now

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
skincare as we know it because we now

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.849 
skincare as we know it because we now
can<00:00:56.460> achieve<00:00:56.820> results<00:00:56.850> that<00:00:57.660> previously<00:00:58.260> we

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
can achieve results that previously we

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:02.180 
can achieve results that previously we
couldn't<00:00:59.309> so<00:01:00.180> that's<00:01:00.390> the<00:01:00.539> initial<00:01:01.190> product

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
couldn't so that's the initial product

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.729 
couldn't so that's the initial product
and<00:01:02.579> it's<00:01:02.699> been<00:01:02.879> copied<00:01:03.300> by<00:01:03.660> many<00:01:04.110> people<00:01:04.559> and

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
and it's been copied by many people and

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.760 
and it's been copied by many people and
then<00:01:05.549> they<00:01:06.180> made<00:01:06.479> the<00:01:06.750> mistake<00:01:07.140> when<00:01:07.560> you

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
then they made the mistake when you

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.690 
then they made the mistake when you
puncture<00:01:08.490> only<00:01:09.150> the<00:01:09.299> stratum<00:01:09.750> corneum<00:01:10.700> you

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
puncture only the stratum corneum you

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.520 
puncture only the stratum corneum you
cannot<00:01:12.180> feel<00:01:12.869> that<00:01:13.350> hole<00:01:14.689> but<00:01:15.689> of<00:01:16.049> course<00:01:16.320> the

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
cannot feel that hole but of course the

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.510 
cannot feel that hole but of course the
the<00:01:17.369> same<00:01:18.090> thing<00:01:18.360> as<00:01:18.540> with<00:01:18.720> the<00:01:18.869> SPF<00:01:19.500> more<00:01:20.189> is

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
the same thing as with the SPF more is

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:26.510 
the same thing as with the SPF more is
better<00:01:20.880> and<00:01:22.280> no<00:01:23.280> pain<00:01:23.580> no<00:01:24.210> gain<00:01:25.009> became<00:01:26.009> their

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
better and no pain no gain became their

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:27.289 
better and no pain no gain became their
motto

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
motto

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.990 
motto
and<00:01:27.570> so<00:01:28.170> they<00:01:28.380> lengthen<00:01:29.009> the<00:01:29.159> needles<00:01:29.549> I<00:01:29.790> had

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
and so they lengthen the needles I had

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.210 
and so they lengthen the needles I had
to<00:01:30.119> work<00:01:30.329> through<00:01:30.720> different<00:01:31.320> lengths<00:01:31.650> to

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
to work through different lengths to

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:38.080 
to work through different lengths to
come<00:01:32.460> to<00:01:33.170> 0.2<00:01:34.170> and<00:01:34.850> I<00:01:35.850> can<00:01:36.299> tell<00:01:36.509> you<00:01:36.600> I<00:01:36.780> can't

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:38.090 
come to 0.2 and I can tell you I can't

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:44.330 
come to 0.2 and I can tell you I can't
take<00:01:39.799> 0.25<00:01:40.909> because<00:01:41.909> it<00:01:42.420> it<00:01:43.380> makes<00:01:43.770> my<00:01:43.950> skin

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
take 0.25 because it it makes my skin

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.370 
take 0.25 because it it makes my skin
too<00:01:44.579> pink<00:01:44.880> if<00:01:45.180> you're<00:01:45.450> going<00:01:45.600> to<00:01:45.780> do<00:01:45.930> it<00:01:46.020> every

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
too pink if you're going to do it every

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.410 
too pink if you're going to do it every
single<00:01:46.590> day<00:01:46.979> and<00:01:47.340> it's<00:01:48.270> also<00:01:48.659> uncomfortable

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:50.420 
single day and it's also uncomfortable

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:56.709 
single day and it's also uncomfortable
0.3<00:01:51.420> is<00:01:51.720> impossible<00:01:54.110> 0.5<00:01:55.110> is<00:01:55.590> a<00:01:55.649> waste<00:01:56.009> of<00:01:56.159> time

00:01:56.709 --> 00:01:56.719 
0.3 is impossible 0.5 is a waste of time

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:58.760 
0.3 is impossible 0.5 is a waste of time
you<00:01:57.719> know<00:01:57.869> because<00:01:58.229> you<00:01:58.380> know<00:01:58.409> you're<00:01:58.740> not

of this works on the number of holes

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:07.730 
of this works on the number of holes
that<00:02:04.799> you<00:02:04.860> make<00:02:05.219> and<00:02:05.579> if<00:02:06.210> you<00:02:06.390> can't<00:02:06.780> feel<00:02:07.320> how
