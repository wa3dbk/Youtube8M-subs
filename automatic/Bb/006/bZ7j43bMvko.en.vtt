00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
easy and simple and let's get started i

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:21.890 
easy and simple and let's get started i
guess<00:00:20.550> i<00:00:20.670> should<00:00:20.820> say<00:00:20.970> what<00:00:21.119> you<00:00:21.210> do<00:00:21.420> you

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
guess i should say what you do you

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.840

and then you think of a book for every
single<00:00:26.279> letter<00:00:26.490> it's<00:00:27.269> pretty

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449
