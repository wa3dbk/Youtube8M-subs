Olympic buzz going on let's starting it

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.090 
Olympic buzz going on let's starting it
quite<00:00:35.760> early<00:00:36.170> well<00:00:37.170> the<00:00:37.260> first<00:00:37.499> official<00:00:37.890> diet

quite early well the first official diet

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.860 
quite early well the first official diet
is<00:00:38.370> shown<00:00:38.519> on<00:00:38.550> BBC<00:00:38.699> and<00:00:39.480> so<00:00:39.570> there's<00:00:39.719> gonna<00:00:39.809> be

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
is shown on BBC and so there's gonna be

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.389 
is shown on BBC and so there's gonna be
a<00:00:39.960> lot<00:00:40.079> of<00:00:40.109> pressure<00:00:40.379> to<00:00:40.679> make<00:00:40.949> sure<00:00:41.100> I<00:00:41.129> do<00:00:41.280> a

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
a lot of pressure to make sure I do a

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.520 
a lot of pressure to make sure I do a
good<00:00:41.609> dive<00:00:41.909> but<00:00:42.210> I<00:00:42.329> guess<00:00:42.510> it's<00:00:42.719> good<00:00:42.899> to<00:00:43.109> have

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
good dive but I guess it's good to have

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.470 
good dive but I guess it's good to have
practice<00:00:44.370> for<00:00:44.550> those<00:00:44.670> kind<00:00:44.940> of<00:00:44.999> pressures<00:00:45.300> in

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
practice for those kind of pressures in

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:46.759 
practice for those kind of pressures in
the<00:00:45.600> Olympic<00:00:45.929> pool<00:00:46.109> because<00:00:46.440> that's<00:00:46.649> what
