with proper shooting series the process

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.570 
with proper shooting series the process
is<00:00:15.690> continuous<00:00:16.289> there<00:00:16.470> are<00:00:16.560> no<00:00:16.770> breaks<00:00:17.130> the

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
is continuous there are no breaks the

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.880 
intensity the ball quickness the idea of
keeping<00:00:20.880> the<00:00:21.210> ball<00:00:21.359> tight<00:00:21.779> and<00:00:22.050> low<00:00:22.230> in<00:00:22.619> tight

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
keeping the ball tight and low in tight

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:24.920 
keeping the ball tight and low in tight
places<00:00:23.130> and<00:00:23.789> attacking<00:00:24.210> the<00:00:24.510> rim<00:00:24.660> whether

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
places and attacking the rim whether

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:26.689 
places and attacking the rim whether
it's<00:00:25.109> off<00:00:25.230> a<00:00:25.320> jump<00:00:25.590> shot<00:00:25.830> or<00:00:26.099> to<00:00:26.430> the<00:00:26.550> rim

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
it's off a jump shot or to the rim

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:29.960 
it's off a jump shot or to the rim
itself<00:00:27.150> again<00:00:27.930> it<00:00:28.170> is<00:00:28.320> continuous<00:00:29.099> it<00:00:29.519> is<00:00:29.640> in

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
itself again it is continuous it is in

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.420 
itself again it is continuous it is in
the<00:00:30.119> other<00:00:30.269> groups<00:00:30.840> of<00:00:31.019> two<00:00:31.349> or<00:00:31.380> three<00:00:31.710> mainly

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
the other groups of two or three mainly

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.520 
the other groups of two or three mainly
so<00:00:32.880> you<00:00:32.940> do<00:00:33.360> get<00:00:33.570> a<00:00:33.630> little<00:00:33.840> bit<00:00:34.079> of<00:00:34.230> a<00:00:34.320> break

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
so you do get a little bit of a break

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.830 
so you do get a little bit of a break
but<00:00:34.770> also<00:00:34.920> have<00:00:35.280> timing<00:00:35.730> so<00:00:35.910> it<00:00:35.969> is<00:00:36.180> not<00:00:36.660> as<00:00:36.809> a

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
but also have timing so it is not as a

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.500 
but also have timing so it is not as a
random<00:00:37.380> pace<00:00:37.680> again<00:00:38.520> the<00:00:38.640> 50-minute<00:00:39.210> work<00:00:39.360> it

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
random pace again the 50-minute work it

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.180 
random pace again the 50-minute work it
out<00:00:39.600> is<00:00:39.719> something<00:00:39.960> that<00:00:40.200> goes<00:00:40.379> strictly<00:00:40.860> by

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
out is something that goes strictly by

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.880 
out is something that goes strictly by
time<00:00:41.510> rotate<00:00:42.510> each<00:00:42.660> drill<00:00:43.020> about<00:00:43.410> every

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
time rotate each drill about every

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.220 
time rotate each drill about every
minute<00:00:44.340> to<00:00:44.520> minute<00:00:44.730> and<00:00:44.879> a<00:00:45.000> half<00:00:45.180> do<00:00:45.870> both

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
minute to minute and a half do both

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.380 
minute to minute and a half do both
sides<00:00:46.680> of<00:00:47.010> the<00:00:47.129> floor<00:00:47.370> so<00:00:47.579> you<00:00:47.610> have<00:00:47.850> balance

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
sides of the floor so you have balance

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.900 
sides of the floor so you have balance
and<00:00:48.510> then<00:00:49.020> to<00:00:49.260> have<00:00:49.350> it<00:00:49.500> more<00:00:49.680> fun<00:00:49.980> clip<00:00:50.670> out<00:00:50.879> a

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
and then to have it more fun clip out a

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.209 
and then to have it more fun clip out a
50<00:00:51.329> minute<00:00:51.570> clip<00:00:51.780> music<00:00:52.050> that<00:00:52.469> you<00:00:52.680> want<00:00:52.949> and

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
50 minute clip music that you want and

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.010 
50 minute clip music that you want and
then<00:00:53.699> work<00:00:54.000> from<00:00:54.149> there<00:00:54.390> and<00:00:54.420> then<00:00:54.600> you<00:00:54.719> can<00:00:54.870> go

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
then work from there and then you can go

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.959 
then work from there and then you can go
by<00:00:55.199> the<00:00:55.230> change<00:00:55.620> of<00:00:55.739> music<00:00:55.890> the<00:00:56.340> 50<00:00:56.730> minute

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
by the change of music the 50 minute

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.209 
by the change of music the 50 minute
workout<00:00:57.329> again<00:00:58.170> the<00:00:58.320> 50<00:00:58.620> minute<00:00:58.890> workout

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
workout again the 50 minute workout

usually starts with two ball
simultaneous<00:01:01.410> we<00:01:01.590> usually<00:01:01.920> go<00:01:02.100> for<00:01:02.280> about<00:01:02.399> a

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
simultaneous we usually go for about a

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.240 
simultaneous we usually go for about a
minute<00:01:02.879> with<00:01:03.270> each<00:01:03.480> series<00:01:03.840> we<00:01:04.409> go<00:01:04.589> for<00:01:04.890> trips

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
minute with each series we go for trips

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.700 
minute with each series we go for trips
from<00:01:05.519> sideline<00:01:06.030> to<00:01:06.180> midpoint<00:01:06.420> ball<00:01:07.110> quick<00:01:07.470> and

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
from sideline to midpoint ball quick and

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.920 
from sideline to midpoint ball quick and
we're<00:01:08.159> going<00:01:08.400> as<00:01:08.490> fast<00:01:08.520> as<00:01:08.939> we<00:01:09.119> can<00:01:09.360> in<00:01:09.570> this

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
we're going as fast as we can in this

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.600 
we're going as fast as we can in this
case<00:01:10.170> we're<00:01:10.409> in<00:01:10.500> partners<00:01:10.950> we're<00:01:11.189> using<00:01:11.340> as

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
case we're in partners we're using as

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.060 
case we're in partners we're using as
much<00:01:11.790> time<00:01:12.119> and<00:01:12.299> space<00:01:12.630> as<00:01:12.900> we<00:01:13.080> can<00:01:13.380> again

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
much time and space as we can again

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.039 
much time and space as we can again
simultaneous<00:01:14.909> then<00:01:15.150> we'll<00:01:15.299> go<00:01:15.450> alternate

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
simultaneous then we'll go alternate

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.530 
simultaneous then we'll go alternate
then<00:01:16.619> we'll<00:01:16.830> go<00:01:16.950> stop<00:01:17.310> and<00:01:17.520> go<00:01:17.729> then<00:01:18.210> we'll<00:01:18.420> go

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
then we'll go stop and go then we'll go

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.990 
then we'll go stop and go then we'll go
stop<00:01:18.900> cross<00:01:19.799> and<00:01:20.159> go<00:01:20.280> and<00:01:20.460> then<00:01:20.580> we'll<00:01:20.759> add<00:01:20.970> a

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
stop cross and go and then we'll add a

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.390 
stop cross and go and then we'll add a
stop<00:01:21.689> one<00:01:22.110> between<00:01:22.380> the<00:01:22.530> legs<00:01:22.740> one<00:01:22.950> in<00:01:23.100> front

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
stop one between the legs one in front

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.700 
stop one between the legs one in front
then<00:01:24.000> we'll<00:01:24.270> you<00:01:24.390> stutter<00:01:24.810> again<00:01:25.500> your

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
then we'll you stutter again your

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.399 
then we'll you stutter again your
imagination<00:01:26.580> is<00:01:26.759> your<00:01:26.790> only<00:01:27.119> limit<00:01:27.689> again<00:01:28.290> the

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
imagination is your only limit again the

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.260 
imagination is your only limit again the
idea<00:01:28.740> is<00:01:28.799> that<00:01:28.979> continuous<00:01:29.610> change<00:01:29.970> it<00:01:30.119> up

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
idea is that continuous change it up

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.080 
idea is that continuous change it up
about<00:01:30.540> every<00:01:30.869> 60<00:01:31.320> to<00:01:31.500> 70<00:01:31.920> seconds<00:01:32.460> but<00:01:32.850> again

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
about every 60 to 70 seconds but again

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.800 
about every 60 to 70 seconds but again

we can go crossover between the legs the
idea<00:04:12.780> is<00:04:12.930> the<00:04:13.049> ball<00:04:13.290> toss<00:04:13.590> to<00:04:13.829> the<00:04:13.950> inside<00:04:14.280> and

00:04:14.449 --> 00:04:14.459 
idea is the ball toss to the inside and

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:16.520 
idea is the ball toss to the inside and
rip<00:04:14.640> it<00:04:14.790> to<00:04:14.880> the<00:04:15.000> outside<00:04:15.150> tight<00:04:16.109> dribble<00:04:16.440> and

and hit the pull-up jumper again you can

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:22.550 
and hit the pull-up jumper again you can
mix<00:04:20.760> it<00:04:20.850> up<00:04:20.970> between<00:04:21.330> between<00:04:21.660> legs<00:04:22.080> inside
