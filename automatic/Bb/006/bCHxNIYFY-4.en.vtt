granite hills countryside

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:16.440 
granite hills countryside
we've<00:01:15.190> had<00:01:15.340> some<00:01:15.550> geologists<00:01:16.060> had<00:01:16.150> and<00:01:16.330> they

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:16.450 
we've had some geologists had and they

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:18.210 
we've had some geologists had and they
reckon<00:01:16.810> that<00:01:16.840> goes<00:01:17.110> back<00:01:17.410> to<00:01:17.560> about<00:01:17.620> 300

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:18.220 
reckon that goes back to about 300

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:20.400 
reckon that goes back to about 300
million<00:01:18.400> years<00:01:18.520> old<00:01:18.850> this<00:01:19.150> countryside<00:01:19.540> and

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:20.410 
million years old this countryside and

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:22.620 
million years old this countryside and
in<00:01:20.590> it<00:01:20.710> study<00:01:20.980> they<00:01:21.190> say<00:01:21.400> these<00:01:21.610> ranges<00:01:22.480> would

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:22.630 
in it study they say these ranges would

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:24.150 
in it study they say these ranges would
have<00:01:22.750> been<00:01:22.870> as<00:01:22.990> I<00:01:23.170> found<00:01:23.530> every<00:01:23.800> season<00:01:23.950> now

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:24.160 
have been as I found every season now

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:26.280 
have been as I found every season now
sort<00:01:24.460> of<00:01:24.490> infinity<00:01:24.970> the<00:01:25.120> Himalayas<00:01:25.630> and<00:01:25.660> stuff

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:26.290 
sort of infinity the Himalayas and stuff

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:29.870 
sort of infinity the Himalayas and stuff
now<00:01:27.100> this<00:01:27.310> pink<00:01:27.610> granite<00:01:27.880> is<00:01:28.690> all<00:01:28.960> topaz<00:01:29.230> there

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
now this pink granite is all topaz there

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.460 
now this pink granite is all topaz there
so<00:01:30.880> they<00:01:31.090> reckon<00:01:31.420> that<00:01:31.450> when<00:01:31.780> the<00:01:31.960> hills<00:01:32.229> were

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:32.470 
so they reckon that when the hills were

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:35.040 
so they reckon that when the hills were
cooling<00:01:33.060> they<00:01:34.060> cooled<00:01:34.360> fairly<00:01:34.780> quickly

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:35.050 
cooling they cooled fairly quickly

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:37.200 
cooling they cooled fairly quickly
someone<00:01:35.410> that<00:01:35.619> makes<00:01:35.770> that<00:01:35.950> and<00:01:36.760> it<00:01:37.000> allowed<00:01:37.180> a

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:37.210 
someone that makes that and it allowed a

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:38.730 
someone that makes that and it allowed a
lot<00:01:37.390> of<00:01:37.479> cracks<00:01:37.780> which<00:01:38.020> will<00:01:38.170> a<00:01:38.290> lot<00:01:38.560> this

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:38.740 
lot of cracks which will a lot this

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:40.830 
lot of cracks which will a lot this
soupy<00:01:39.310> it<00:01:39.580> all<00:01:39.820> mixes<00:01:40.180> or<00:01:40.300> whatever<00:01:40.600> it<00:01:40.660> was<00:01:40.780> to

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:40.840 
soupy it all mixes or whatever it was to

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:43.440 
soupy it all mixes or whatever it was to
come<00:01:41.260> up<00:01:41.290> into<00:01:41.680> permeate<00:01:42.250> through<00:01:42.520> the<00:01:43.210> rocks

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:43.450 
come up into permeate through the rocks

come up into permeate through the rocks
and<00:01:43.660> the<00:01:43.780> crack<00:01:44.050> and<00:01:44.950> that<00:01:45.820> crystallized<00:01:46.690> and

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:46.720 
and the crack and that crystallized and

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:51.120 
and the crack and that crystallized and
did<00:01:47.140> its<00:01:47.290> thing<00:01:47.350> and<00:01:47.530> form<00:01:47.890> the<00:01:48.010> topaz<00:01:50.130> about

form or nice little crystals and it will

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:41.550 
form or nice little crystals and it will
cleave<00:02:39.280> on<00:02:39.519> that<00:02:39.940> sheet<00:02:40.269> and<00:02:40.450> just<00:02:40.840> very

cleave on that sheet and just very

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:44.340 
cleave on that sheet and just very
nicely<00:02:41.799> breaks<00:02:42.549> off<00:02:42.760> and<00:02:43.060> their<00:02:43.840> cracks<00:02:44.170> like

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:44.350 
nicely breaks off and their cracks like

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:45.630 
nicely breaks off and their cracks like
a<00:02:44.380> window<00:02:44.799> that
