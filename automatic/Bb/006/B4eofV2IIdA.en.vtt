finished<00:00:34.050> devices<00:00:34.710> and<00:00:35.010> material<00:00:35.460> science<00:00:35.850> is

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
finished devices and material science is

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.209 
finished devices and material science is
a<00:00:36.030> really<00:00:36.390> good<00:00:36.780> field<00:00:37.079> it's<00:00:37.649> kind<00:00:37.829> of<00:00:37.920> a<00:00:38.010> nice

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
a really good field it's kind of a nice

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:41.740 
a really good field it's kind of a nice
way<00:00:38.969> to<00:00:39.000> do<00:00:39.329> some<00:00:39.809> lab<00:00:40.469> work<00:00:40.500> and<00:00:41.190> some

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:41.750 
way to do some lab work and some

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:45.139 
way to do some lab work and some
manufacturing<00:00:42.750> work<00:00:43.079> so<00:00:44.070> I<00:00:44.160> came<00:00:44.340> to<00:00:44.700> material

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
manufacturing work so I came to material

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.540 
manufacturing work so I came to material
science<00:00:45.200> after<00:00:46.200> working<00:00:46.590> as<00:00:46.770> a<00:00:46.800> glass<00:00:47.129> artist

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
science after working as a glass artist

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:48.500 
science after working as a glass artist
for<00:00:47.700> 10<00:00:47.910> years

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
for 10 years

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.240 
for 10 years
so<00:00:48.780> I<00:00:48.840> could<00:00:48.989> have<00:00:49.020> a<00:00:49.170> technical<00:00:49.800> side<00:00:50.039> to

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
so I could have a technical side to

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.790 
so I could have a technical side to
complement<00:00:50.820> my<00:00:51.300> the<00:00:51.719> creative<00:00:52.140> understanding

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
complement my the creative understanding

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.459 
complement my the creative understanding
I<00:00:52.890> had<00:00:53.129> but<00:00:53.730> I<00:00:53.760> also<00:00:53.969> wanted<00:00:54.449> to<00:00:54.510> try<00:00:55.230> to<00:00:55.289> help

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
I had but I also wanted to try to help

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:58.639 
I had but I also wanted to try to help
contribute<00:00:56.210> to<00:00:57.210> reducing<00:00:57.690> our<00:00:57.840> impact<00:00:58.050> on<00:00:58.590> the

environment through studying material

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.349 
environment through studying material
science<00:01:01.309> there's<00:01:02.309> such<00:01:02.489> a<00:01:02.520> large<00:01:02.879> amount<00:01:03.300> of

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
science there's such a large amount of

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.390 
science there's such a large amount of
energy<00:01:03.539> from<00:01:04.470> the<00:01:04.559> Sun<00:01:04.890> that<00:01:05.070> hits<00:01:05.159> our<00:01:05.339> planet

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
energy from the Sun that hits our planet

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.700 
energy from the Sun that hits our planet
every<00:01:06.000> day<00:01:06.180> even<00:01:06.930> in<00:01:07.049> a<00:01:07.140> place<00:01:07.350> where<00:01:07.590> it's

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
every day even in a place where it's

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.080 
every day even in a place where it's
cloudy<00:01:07.950> you're<00:01:08.310> still<00:01:08.549> getting<00:01:08.700> a<00:01:08.909> lot<00:01:09.060> of

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
cloudy you're still getting a lot of

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.149 
cloudy you're still getting a lot of
energy<00:01:09.479> from<00:01:09.659> the<00:01:09.840> Sun<00:01:10.080> and<00:01:10.110> so<00:01:10.470> there's<00:01:11.070> just

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
energy from the Sun and so there's just

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.700 
energy from the Sun and so there's just
constant<00:01:11.760> free<00:01:12.360> energy<00:01:12.750> coming<00:01:12.990> in<00:01:13.260> so<00:01:13.530> if<00:01:13.590> we

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
constant free energy coming in so if we

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.920 
constant free energy coming in so if we
can<00:01:13.890> figure<00:01:14.310> out<00:01:14.490> a<00:01:14.549> way<00:01:14.700> to<00:01:14.760> use<00:01:15.060> that<00:01:15.330> that<00:01:15.750> we

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
can figure out a way to use that that we

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.539 
can figure out a way to use that that we
could<00:01:16.110> drastically<00:01:16.619> reduce<00:01:17.130> our<00:01:17.520> energy

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
could drastically reduce our energy

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:21.320 
could drastically reduce our energy
usage<00:01:18.150> and<00:01:18.990> our<00:01:19.170> need<00:01:19.380> for<00:01:19.409> fossil<00:01:20.220> fuels<00:01:20.490> I'm

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
usage and our need for fossil fuels I'm

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.570 
usage and our need for fossil fuels I'm
working<00:01:21.720> in<00:01:21.840> a<00:01:21.930> research<00:01:22.080> group<00:01:22.560> under<00:01:23.130> dr.

unconventional materials to make
electronic<00:01:28.799> devices<00:01:29.369> and<00:01:29.939> so<00:01:30.420> I'm<00:01:30.630> actually

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
electronic devices and so I'm actually

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.440 
electronic devices and so I'm actually
working<00:01:31.320> in<00:01:31.590> the<00:01:31.680> portion<00:01:32.040> of<00:01:32.130> the<00:01:32.220> group<00:01:32.460> that

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
working in the portion of the group that

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.730 
working in the portion of the group that

of<00:01:37.799> plastic<00:01:38.340> based<00:01:38.610> materials<00:01:39.299> so<00:01:39.990> that<00:01:40.170> they

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
of plastic based materials so that they

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:43.429 
of plastic based materials so that they
can<00:01:40.439> be<00:01:40.560> made<00:01:40.799> more<00:01:41.520> affordable<00:01:42.210> so<00:01:42.840> that<00:01:43.020> more

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
can be made more affordable so that more

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.350 
can be made more affordable so that more
consumers<00:01:44.040> can<00:01:44.250> actually<00:01:44.549> buy<00:01:44.700> them<00:01:44.970> and<00:01:45.180> use

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
consumers can actually buy them and use

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.080 
consumers can actually buy them and use
them<00:01:45.659> one<00:01:46.350> of<00:01:46.439> the<00:01:46.560> main<00:01:47.159> benefits<00:01:47.460> of<00:01:47.939> these

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
them one of the main benefits of these

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.920 
them one of the main benefits of these
is<00:01:48.390> that<00:01:48.600> they<00:01:49.049> can<00:01:49.229> be<00:01:49.259> made<00:01:49.560> on<00:01:49.740> flexible

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:50.930 
is that they can be made on flexible

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:54.980 
is that they can be made on flexible
substrates<00:01:51.930> and<00:01:52.229> so<00:01:53.180> you<00:01:54.180> could<00:01:54.360> have<00:01:54.540> them<00:01:54.780> a

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
substrates and so you could have them a

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.590 
substrates and so you could have them a
solar<00:01:55.950> panel<00:01:56.219> that<00:01:56.399> you<00:01:56.610> roll<00:01:56.880> up<00:01:56.909> and<00:01:57.329> put<00:01:57.509> in

solar panel that you roll up and put in
your<00:01:57.750> backpack<00:01:57.960> you<00:01:58.770> know<00:01:58.799> out<00:01:59.130> in<00:01:59.159> the<00:01:59.369> field

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
your backpack you know out in the field

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.789 
your backpack you know out in the field
and<00:02:00.000> you<00:02:00.240> just<00:02:00.450> want<00:02:00.630> to<00:02:00.689> get<00:02:01.110> on<00:02:01.200> your<00:02:01.229> laptop

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
and you just want to get on your laptop

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:03.920 
and you just want to get on your laptop
and<00:02:02.070> you<00:02:02.700> know<00:02:02.820> lay<00:02:03.000> in<00:02:03.119> the<00:02:03.210> grass<00:02:03.240> someplace

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
and you know lay in the grass someplace

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:05.660 
and you know lay in the grass someplace
so<00:02:04.170> that<00:02:04.290> you<00:02:04.380> can<00:02:04.530> power<00:02:04.740> your<00:02:04.890> computer<00:02:05.460> that

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
so that you can power your computer that

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.850 
so that you can power your computer that
way<00:02:05.880> and<00:02:06.270> that's<00:02:06.659> one<00:02:06.899> of<00:02:06.930> the<00:02:07.079> key<00:02:07.259> components

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
way and that's one of the key components

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.750 
way and that's one of the key components
of<00:02:07.920> engineering<00:02:08.640> is<00:02:08.759> kind<00:02:09.000> of<00:02:09.090> using<00:02:09.920> ideas

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
of engineering is kind of using ideas

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.509 
of engineering is kind of using ideas
from<00:02:12.090> research<00:02:12.390> science<00:02:13.140> and<00:02:13.519> implementing

from research science and implementing

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:17.149 
from research science and implementing
them<00:02:14.700> into<00:02:15.799> solutions<00:02:16.799> that<00:02:17.010> will<00:02:17.099> actually

00:02:17.149 --> 00:02:17.159 
them into solutions that will actually

00:02:17.159 --> 00:02:19.550 
them into solutions that will actually
be<00:02:17.849> used<00:02:17.879> by<00:02:18.390> society<00:02:19.049> and<00:02:19.260> will<00:02:19.379> make<00:02:19.530> a
