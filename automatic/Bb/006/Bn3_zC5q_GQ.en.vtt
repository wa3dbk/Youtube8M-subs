00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
all right guys we're gonna test out some

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.960 
all right guys we're gonna test out some
LEDs<00:01:03.870> right<00:01:04.049> now<00:01:04.229> we're<00:01:05.100> gonna<00:01:05.250> see<00:01:05.489> what<00:01:05.519> part

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
LEDs right now we're gonna see what part

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.360 
LEDs right now we're gonna see what part
we<00:01:06.120> getting<00:01:06.479> assume<00:01:06.960> that<00:01:07.200> at<00:01:07.740> the<00:01:08.010> same

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:08.370

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:22.260 
spot a little bit a little bit lower at

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:23.600 
spot a little bit a little bit lower at
the<00:01:22.380> face<00:01:22.530> it's<00:01:22.740> straight<00:01:22.950> up<00:01:23.070> and<00:01:23.220> down<00:01:23.250> gene

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
the face it's straight up and down gene

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.050 
yes exactly at the light you have to
meet<00:01:25.409> the<00:01:26.070> where's<00:01:26.310> the<00:01:26.400> light<00:01:26.549> face<00:01:26.760> in<00:01:26.909> there

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
meet the where's the light face in there

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:34.999 
meet the where's the light face in there
it's<00:01:27.600> facing<00:01:27.810> like<00:01:28.649> this<00:01:28.920> like<00:01:29.549> you<00:01:33.799> know<00:01:34.799> it's

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009

it's facing like this like you know it's
a<00:01:35.100> little<00:01:35.250> bit<00:01:35.430> lower<00:01:35.609> but<00:01:36.390> let's<00:01:37.200> put<00:01:37.320> it

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
a little bit lower but let's put it

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:38.810 
a little bit lower but let's put it
closer<00:01:37.649> to<00:01:37.799> see<00:01:37.979> what<00:01:38.310> the<00:01:38.399> part<00:01:38.609> is<00:01:38.700> waiting

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
closer to see what the part is waiting

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.039 
closer to see what the part is waiting
at<00:01:39.090> at<00:01:39.270> that<00:01:39.479> oh<00:01:39.750> right<00:01:40.679> right<00:01:41.009> there<00:01:41.250> it's<00:01:41.490> 200

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:42.049 
at at that oh right right there it's 200

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:45.889 
at at that oh right right there it's 200
later<00:01:43.049> okay<00:01:44.039> so<00:01:44.820> we<00:01:45.240> know<00:01:45.420> where<00:01:45.600> we're<00:01:45.750> aiming

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
later okay so we know where we're aiming

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.679 
later okay so we know where we're aiming
at<00:01:46.109> 200<00:01:46.679> but<00:01:47.310> I<00:01:47.340> don't<00:01:47.579> know<00:01:47.640> if<00:01:47.759> this<00:01:47.909> is<00:01:48.060> good

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
at 200 but I don't know if this is good

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.359 
at 200 but I don't know if this is good
because<00:01:48.869> the<00:01:49.049> way<00:01:49.170> the<00:01:49.350> LED<00:01:49.740> are<00:01:49.950> facing

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
because the way the LED are facing

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:53.870 
because the way the LED are facing
they're<00:01:50.549> not<00:01:50.729> facing<00:01:50.939> directly<00:01:51.359> down<00:01:51.780> so<00:01:52.880> this

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
they're not facing directly down so this

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.200 
they're not facing directly down so this
is<00:01:54.030> the<00:01:54.590> you<00:01:55.590> cannot<00:01:55.890> you<00:01:56.310> can't<00:01:56.520> can't<00:01:56.939> really
