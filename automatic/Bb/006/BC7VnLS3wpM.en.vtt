after I use the pin brush to remove any
tangled<00:02:42.599> hair<00:02:42.870> and<00:02:44.750> the<00:02:45.750> tail

00:02:53.759 --> 00:02:53.769 

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:57.460 

so<00:02:54.769> there<00:02:55.069> is<00:02:55.220> a<00:02:55.250> little<00:02:55.489> tank<00:02:55.879> of<00:02:56.060> code<00:02:56.470> based

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:57.470 
so there is a little tank of code based

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:59.679 
so there is a little tank of code based
on<00:02:57.680> the<00:02:57.769> tale<00:02:58.069> which<00:02:58.549> I<00:02:58.670> can<00:02:58.849> just<00:02:59.030> remove<00:02:59.390> with

00:02:59.679 --> 00:02:59.689 
on the tale which I can just remove with

00:02:59.689 --> 00:03:09.170 
on the tale which I can just remove with

actually the area around his anus has
been<00:03:34.239> trimmed<00:03:34.540> a<00:03:34.660> bit<00:03:34.920> just<00:03:35.920> prevent<00:03:36.489> species

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:36.940 
been trimmed a bit just prevent species

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:40.410 
been trimmed a bit just prevent species
from<00:03:37.180> catching<00:03:37.450> in<00:03:37.840> the<00:03:38.530> in<00:03:38.680> the<00:03:38.829> coat<00:03:39.209> laws<00:03:40.209> of

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:40.420 
from catching in the in the coat laws of

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:42.330 
from catching in the in the coat laws of
the<00:03:40.510> drop<00:03:40.750> to<00:03:40.930> the<00:03:41.049> ground<00:03:41.079> without<00:03:41.890> getting

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:42.340 
the drop to the ground without getting

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:45.000 
the drop to the ground without getting
stuck<00:03:42.640> in<00:03:42.819> the<00:03:42.910> coat<00:03:43.440> area<00:03:44.440> that's<00:03:44.709> trimmed

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:45.010 
stuck in the coat area that's trimmed

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:47.580 
stuck in the coat area that's trimmed
should<00:03:45.250> be<00:03:45.459> just<00:03:45.640> right<00:03:45.879> around<00:03:46.000> the<00:03:46.239> anus<00:03:46.599> and

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:47.590 
should be just right around the anus and

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:49.050 
should be just right around the anus and
if<00:03:47.739> you<00:03:47.859> have<00:03:47.950> an<00:03:48.069> intact<00:03:48.459> dog<00:03:48.790> you<00:03:49.030> always

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:49.060 
if you have an intact dog you always

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:50.940 
if you have an intact dog you always
want<00:03:49.540> to<00:03:49.569> check<00:03:49.750> from<00:03:49.959> the<00:03:50.109> testicles<00:03:50.680> to<00:03:50.829> make

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:50.950 
want to check from the testicles to make

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:52.440 
want to check from the testicles to make
sure<00:03:51.099> that<00:03:51.250> there<00:03:51.430> aren't<00:03:51.549> any<00:03:51.700> mats<00:03:52.030> between

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:52.450 
sure that there aren't any mats between

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:54.750 
sure that there aren't any mats between
the<00:03:52.540> testicles<00:03:53.140> and<00:03:53.319> the<00:03:53.379> legs<00:03:53.650> because<00:03:54.579> this

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:54.760 
the testicles and the legs because this

00:03:54.760 --> 00:04:03.960 
the testicles and the legs because this
array<00:03:55.000> can<00:03:55.209> actually<00:03:55.599> math<00:03:55.870> a<00:03:56.140> bit<00:04:02.910> okay<00:04:03.910> so

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:03.970 
array can actually math a bit okay so

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:05.789 
array can actually math a bit okay so
when<00:04:04.209> I<00:04:04.239> finished<00:04:04.750> actually<00:04:04.989> using<00:04:05.470> the<00:04:05.590> pin

00:04:05.789 --> 00:04:05.799 
when I finished actually using the pin

00:04:05.799 --> 00:04:10.080 
when I finished actually using the pin
brush<00:04:06.040> on<00:04:06.370> anguses<00:04:07.620> entire<00:04:08.620> coat<00:04:09.040> I<00:04:09.790> actually

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:02.800 
that I up and do at the very end let's

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:04.230 
that I up and do at the very end let's
just<00:05:02.950> make<00:05:03.100> sure<00:05:03.250> that<00:05:03.370> I've<00:05:03.490> gotten<00:05:03.820> all<00:05:04.030> the

fine mats out of his paws and for that

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:11.820 
fine mats out of his paws and for that
what<00:05:10.240> I<00:05:10.270> usually<00:05:10.690> use<00:05:10.930> is<00:05:11.200> just<00:05:11.350> a<00:05:11.530> slicker

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:11.830 
what I usually use is just a slicker

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:13.440 
what I usually use is just a slicker
brush<00:05:12.100> I<00:05:12.310> don't<00:05:12.520> use<00:05:12.640> the<00:05:12.760> slicker<00:05:13.060> brush<00:05:13.240> very

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:13.450 
brush I don't use the slicker brush very

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:15.960 
brush I don't use the slicker brush very
much<00:05:13.630> because<00:05:13.960> it's<00:05:14.140> supposedly<00:05:15.130> hard<00:05:15.670> on<00:05:15.880> the

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:15.970 
much because it's supposedly hard on the

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:18.060 
much because it's supposedly hard on the
coat<00:05:16.240> and<00:05:16.540> it<00:05:16.600> also<00:05:16.750> can<00:05:17.050> scratch<00:05:17.650> the<00:05:17.860> dog's

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:18.070 
coat and it also can scratch the dog's

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:20.730 
coat and it also can scratch the dog's
