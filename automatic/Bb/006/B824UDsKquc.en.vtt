at<00:01:32.479> first<00:01:33.170> glance<00:01:33.440> the<00:01:33.800> task<00:01:34.070> we<00:01:34.280> set

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:34.490 
at first glance the task we set

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:36.910 
at first glance the task we set
ourselves<00:01:34.640> looks<00:01:35.210> quite<00:01:35.600> simple<00:01:35.930> especially

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:36.920 
ourselves looks quite simple especially

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:38.770 
ourselves looks quite simple especially
when<00:01:37.040> you<00:01:37.130> have<00:01:37.280> to<00:01:37.550> cross<00:01:37.880> verses<00:01:38.330> high-tech

machinery<00:01:39.110> to<00:01:39.619> play<00:01:39.830> with<00:01:40.960> but<00:01:41.960> to<00:01:42.110> even<00:01:42.470> give

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:44.140 
machinery to play with but to even give
ourselves<00:01:42.830> a<00:01:43.250> fighting<00:01:43.759> chance

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:44.150 
ourselves a fighting chance

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:47.050 
ourselves a fighting chance
we<00:01:44.570> had<00:01:44.720> to<00:01:44.869> fit<00:01:45.050> every<00:01:45.619> one<00:01:45.860> of<00:01:45.890> the<00:01:46.130> SUVs<00:01:46.250> with

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:47.060 
we had to fit every one of the SUVs with

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:49.560 
we had to fit every one of the SUVs with
snow<00:01:47.390> chains

snow chains

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:52.330

but since our chains were homemade and

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:55.010

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:27.199 
to come to a grinding halt in about 20
meters<00:02:24.750> so<00:02:25.750> now<00:02:25.840> what<00:02:25.989> happened<00:02:26.380> is<00:02:26.470> that<00:02:26.680> the

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:57.780 
shining now let's be honest Bertie has
gone<00:04:56.710> through<00:04:56.890> this<00:04:57.040> part<00:04:57.280> with<00:04:57.490> the<00:04:57.610> Land

00:04:57.780 --> 00:04:57.790

gone through this part with the Land
Rover

00:04:58.140 --> 00:04:58.150 
Rover

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:01.800 
Rover
and<00:04:58.330> he<00:04:59.050> has<00:04:59.169> flattened<00:04:59.650> it<00:04:59.740> out<00:04:59.830> a<00:05:00.040> bit<00:05:00.810> but

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:01.810 
and he has flattened it out a bit but

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:03.750 
and he has flattened it out a bit but
let's<00:05:01.990> see<00:05:02.110> once<00:05:02.320> we<00:05:02.410> get<00:05:02.800> to<00:05:03.130> the<00:05:03.250> spot<00:05:03.580> that

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:03.760 
let's see once we get to the spot that

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:05.340 
let's see once we get to the spot that
he<00:05:03.880> got<00:05:04.120> scuffed<00:05:04.390> let's<00:05:04.960> see<00:05:05.080> how<00:05:05.200> much

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:05.350 
he got scuffed let's see how much

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:09.189 
he got scuffed let's see how much
further<00:05:05.710> can<00:05:05.890> he<00:05:06.190> go

00:05:09.189 --> 00:05:09.199 

00:05:09.199 --> 00:05:11.689 

so<00:05:10.199> we<00:05:10.319> have<00:05:10.409> come<00:05:10.529> to<00:05:10.649> the<00:05:10.739> first<00:05:10.979> 50<00:05:11.399> meters

00:05:11.689 --> 00:05:11.699 
so we have come to the first 50 meters

00:05:11.699 --> 00:05:14.479 
so we have come to the first 50 meters
and<00:05:11.939> has<00:05:12.149> been<00:05:12.359> no<00:05:12.659> problem<00:05:13.319> absolutely

00:05:14.479 --> 00:05:14.489

this massive v8 engine and the massive

00:05:17.189 --> 00:05:19.519 
this massive v8 engine and the massive
torque<00:05:17.639> that<00:05:17.819> is<00:05:17.879> make<00:05:18.209> is<00:05:18.629> just<00:05:18.689> monstering

00:05:19.519 --> 00:05:19.529 
torque that is make is just monstering

00:05:19.529 --> 00:05:23.230
