00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:04.060
 what a josé 

00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:08.820
 these holidays were to disconnect from work but during these days we 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.500
 spoke of disconnecting if what I'm living an unforgettable experience 

00:00:15.789 --> 00:00:20.599
 I am in the region of sources of Narcea in the heart of Asturias and 

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:24.170
 I have proposed to go through the three councils that form cangas de narcea 

00:00:24.169 --> 00:00:27.039
 of cane on days 

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:31.700
 from this quiet terrace you could see steep vineyards surround you the house 

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:33.000
 where I stay 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.190
 others instead are surrounded by lush forests Juan towns 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:38.330
 lovely 

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:43.260
 the service could not be more friendly and at night here really 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.780
 rest well 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.450
 the nature that this place 

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:49.050
 it is indescribable 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.110
 their eyes that their streams and their fauna 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.040
 you have to see them to create them 

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:57.890
 a simple walk between the councils becomes a gift for the eyes 

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:01.400
 inviting to lift the foot of the accelerator 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:04.400
 to fully enjoy the experience 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:08.180
 the gastronomy of the zone 10 exquisite 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:13.090
 It was also a pleasant surprise to discover that you saw corner translated video 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:17.020
 We have been able to visit their barrels and lock the characteristic taste of wine 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:18.270
 from asturias 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.270
 I'm looking forward to singing with you a box that bears your name 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:26.370
 you should be here and their villages and houses 

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:29.490
 stroll through its squares and cobbled streets 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.420
 It is an invitation to travel in time 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:35.850
 you have your own personality 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.160
 and looking without hurry it is not hard to find places where crafts 

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:42.920
 of place is a worker as it was centuries ago 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:47.549
 the barrel materazzi are more than raw material that simpre iras charros 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:50.020
 still omar girls 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:53.020
 I also witness a detail with which I hope I have succeeded 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:57.810
 but do not think that I spent my days looking at the landscape here as well 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.150
 there is time for sport with a wide range of active tourism 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.730
 and if you prefer something quieter you can try your luck with fishing in their 

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:07.710
 multiple rivers 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.950
 but before we leave we still have to visit the royal house 

00:02:11.469 --> 00:02:15.760
 and the nature classroom of the natural park of the sources of the narcea of 

00:02:15.759 --> 00:02:17.169
 cane on days 

00:02:17.169 --> 00:02:19.759
 the reception center of alejandro casona 

00:02:19.759 --> 00:02:21.759
 the san antolín palloza 

00:02:21.759 --> 00:02:25.129
 the center of interpretation of muniellos the center of interpretation 

00:02:25.129 --> 00:02:27.529
 of mountains gold 

00:02:27.529 --> 00:02:30.069
 I think we'll stay a couple of days more 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:34.599
 I will tell you my whole return but until then I will continue enjoying this 

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:37.599
 incredible said 

00:02:41.499 --> 00:02:44.369
