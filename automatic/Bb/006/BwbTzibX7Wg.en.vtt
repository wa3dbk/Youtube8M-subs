00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:51.719 
course it's an applied rules provides
doesn't<00:01:50.679> apply<00:01:50.830> because<00:01:50.890> it<00:01:51.130> was<00:01:51.220> nice<00:01:51.459> to<00:01:51.640> go

and<00:03:00.310> they<00:03:00.400> know<00:03:00.550> they<00:03:00.670> therefore<00:03:00.940> and<00:03:01.360> he'll

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:01.450 
and they know they therefore and he'll

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:06.090 
and they know they therefore and he'll
bounce<00:03:01.630> right<00:03:01.870> back<00:03:01.930> up<00:03:02.110> whereas<00:03:04.290> dolch<00:03:05.290> it

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:06.100 
bounce right back up whereas dolch it

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:07.920 
bounce right back up whereas dolch it
takes<00:03:06.370> them<00:03:06.520> a<00:03:06.610> little<00:03:06.730> longer<00:03:07.270> to<00:03:07.540> learn<00:03:07.690> and

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:07.930 
takes them a little longer to learn and

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:10.140 
takes them a little longer to learn and
ride<00:03:08.140> some<00:03:08.410> some<00:03:08.770> over<00:03:09.550> those<00:03:09.850> have<00:03:10.030> been
