00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
couldn't grow because the elk would

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.070 
couldn't grow because the elk would

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
the rivers and the ponds they started to

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.030 
the rivers and the ponds they started to
fill<00:01:20.759> up<00:01:20.790> with<00:01:21.180> mud<00:01:21.540> and<00:01:21.570> algae<00:01:22.200> all<00:01:22.409> the
