00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:13.530
 from the 90s to which we grow separated a 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:15.930
 lucio battisti 60s and 70s now 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.580
 we come directly to the 90's with 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.979

 famous and for a song a song 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:26.100
 very beautiful that saved the life of 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:27.869
 many guitarists since not 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.310
 you never know what to do i do that tea 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:31.290
 however, it is very difficult to sing 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.149
 beautiful to play so you're one 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.850
 woman who sings and the idea must do and yes 

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:39.050
 entitled whatsapp while many la 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.050
 they call what's going on 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:43.830
 see what happens whatsapp whatsapp e 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.300
 happens that the songs are three welcomes 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:46.830
 this then assured success 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:49.939
 the only difficulty is that there is a bar is 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:54.479
 however the first agreement is the largest 

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:56.880
 yes the second agreement and yes minor yes 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:02:00.390
 the less you do so you die a little already 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:05.250
 you're on the balls making a song 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:07.590
 without success murray si minor is a 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:09.209
 sea ​​second key anyway they broke 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:13.380
 the balls that guys don't know which ones 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:16.230
 missing then you live once 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:18.850
 the major king greater than less 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:21.470
 this is easy 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:24.160
 then the rhythm of this song here 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:24.160
 is the following one 

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:28.740

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:37.510

 beginners here is the first but is 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:01.260
 also the last agreement therefore being a 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:03.480
 ride when you get to the reconnects the 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:06.439
