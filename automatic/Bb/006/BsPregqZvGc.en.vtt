the face we age and that triangle starts

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:40.600 
the face we age and that triangle starts
instead<00:02:38.690> of<00:02:38.780> being<00:02:38.959> like<00:02:39.110> this<00:02:39.320> it<00:02:39.739> starts<00:02:40.310> to

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:40.610 
instead of being like this it starts to

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:42.670 
instead of being like this it starts to
become<00:02:41.000> more<00:02:41.600> of<00:02:41.720> an<00:02:41.810> oblong<00:02:42.110> we<00:02:42.350> lose<00:02:42.530> our

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:42.680 
become more of an oblong we lose our

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:45.520 
become more of an oblong we lose our
cheek<00:02:42.950> volume<00:02:43.299> we<00:02:44.299> get<00:02:44.510> wider<00:02:44.840> in<00:02:45.140> the<00:02:45.170> jowl

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:45.530 
cheek volume we get wider in the jowl

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:47.050 
cheek volume we get wider in the jowl
and<00:02:45.829> it's

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.060 
and it's

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:49.270 
and it's
kind<00:02:47.300> of<00:02:47.420> thing<00:02:47.660> we<00:02:47.930> associate<00:02:48.680> with<00:02:48.709> aging

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:49.280 
kind of thing we associate with aging

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:52.050 
kind of thing we associate with aging
but<00:02:49.880> actually<00:02:50.510> when<00:02:50.750> we<00:02:50.780> perceive<00:02:51.380> ourselves

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:52.060 
but actually when we perceive ourselves

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:56.680 
but actually when we perceive ourselves
to<00:02:53.060> be<00:02:53.180> sagging<00:02:53.480> and<00:02:53.840> drooping<00:02:55.390> actually<00:02:56.390> most

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:56.690 
to be sagging and drooping actually most

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:58.540 
to be sagging and drooping actually most
of<00:02:56.930> that<00:02:57.080> the<00:02:57.319> first<00:02:57.500> of<00:02:57.709> eight<00:02:57.860> years<00:02:58.069> or<00:02:58.340> so

00:02:58.540 --> 00:02:58.550 
of that the first of eight years or so

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:02.280 
of that the first of eight years or so
is<00:02:58.790> due<00:02:59.030> to<00:02:59.209> just<00:02:59.590> volume<00:03:00.590> loss<00:03:00.800> in<00:03:01.040> the<00:03:01.130> face

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:02.290 
is due to just volume loss in the face

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:04.720 
is due to just volume loss in the face
so<00:03:03.290> why<00:03:03.440> do<00:03:03.500> we<00:03:03.709> use<00:03:03.739> hyaluronic<00:03:04.099> acid<00:03:04.640> again

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:04.730 
so why do we use hyaluronic acid again

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:07.050 
so why do we use hyaluronic acid again
this<00:03:05.120> was<00:03:05.330> touched<00:03:05.569> on<00:03:05.750> we<00:03:05.870> use<00:03:06.019> it<00:03:06.140> because

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:07.060 
this was touched on we use it because

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:09.430 
this was touched on we use it because
large<00:03:08.060> molecular<00:03:08.569> weight<00:03:08.690> hyaluronic<00:03:09.140> acid

cannot cross the skin and that was said
earlier<00:03:11.390> it<00:03:12.170> has<00:03:12.349> to<00:03:12.500> be<00:03:12.620> injected<00:03:12.830> in<00:03:13.160> the

and address the aging process so the
