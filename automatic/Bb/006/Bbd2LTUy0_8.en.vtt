like these flooville u filters but
there's<00:00:57.420> many<00:00:57.809> options<00:00:58.320> and<00:00:58.559> just<00:00:58.620> try<00:00:59.039> to

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
there's many options and just try to

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.450 
there's many options and just try to

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
make sure you have at least double the

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.729 
make sure you have at least double the
filtration<00:01:02.940> amount<00:01:03.750> on<00:01:03.960> your<00:01:03.989> filter<00:01:04.290> rating

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
filtration amount on your filter rating

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.250 
filtration amount on your filter rating
as<00:01:04.860> the<00:01:05.280> amount<00:01:05.519> of<00:01:05.610> water<00:01:05.760> in<00:01:05.970> your<00:01:06.060> tank

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:06.260 
as the amount of water in your tank

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.420 
as the amount of water in your tank
because<00:01:07.260> Turtles<00:01:07.590> are<00:01:07.830> pretty<00:01:07.979> dirty<00:01:08.189> and

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
because Turtles are pretty dirty and

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.359 
because Turtles are pretty dirty and
that<00:01:08.760> helps<00:01:09.119> everything<00:01:09.390> get<00:01:09.630> filtered<00:01:09.840> on

00:01:10.359 --> 00:01:10.369 
that helps everything get filtered on

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:12.770 
that helps everything get filtered on
the<00:01:11.369> bottom<00:01:11.580> of<00:01:11.670> the<00:01:11.729> tank<00:01:11.909> some<00:01:12.240> people<00:01:12.600> do

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
the bottom of the tank some people do

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.140 
the bottom of the tank some people do
like<00:01:13.049> this<00:01:13.260> just<00:01:14.189> a<00:01:14.280> bare<00:01:14.490> bottom<00:01:14.909> for<00:01:15.060> the

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
like this just a bare bottom for the

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:16.850 
like this just a bare bottom for the
turtles<00:01:15.509> because<00:01:15.720> it<00:01:15.840> helps<00:01:16.080> keep<00:01:16.259> it<00:01:16.470> the

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
turtles because it helps keep it the

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.920 
turtles because it helps keep it the
tank<00:01:17.070> cleaner<00:01:17.400> nothing<00:01:18.150> gets<00:01:18.299> stuck<00:01:18.509> in<00:01:18.689> rocks

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
tank cleaner nothing gets stuck in rocks

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.840 
tank cleaner nothing gets stuck in rocks
and<00:01:19.259> everything<00:01:19.290> it's<00:01:19.650> cleaner<00:01:19.890> but<00:01:20.729> I'm

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
and everything it's cleaner but I'm

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.219 
and everything it's cleaner but I'm
actually<00:01:21.030> going<00:01:21.270> to<00:01:21.360> add<00:01:21.509> some<00:01:21.750> gravel<00:01:22.140> to

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
actually going to add some gravel to

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:25.760 
actually going to add some gravel to
this<00:01:22.350> because<00:01:22.799> in<00:01:23.040> gravel<00:01:24.770> biological

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
this because in gravel biological

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.289 
this because in gravel biological
bacteria<00:01:26.340> will<00:01:26.549> grow<00:01:26.580> and<00:01:27.030> they'll<00:01:27.180> actually

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
bacteria will grow and they'll actually

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:28.760 
bacteria will grow and they'll actually
help<00:01:27.600> clean<00:01:27.900> your<00:01:28.049> tank<00:01:28.290> so<00:01:28.500> it's<00:01:28.619> actually

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
good to have some gravel for turtles you

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.450 
good to have some gravel for turtles you
want<00:01:30.990> larger<00:01:31.200> gravel<00:01:31.770> stuff<00:01:32.100> they<00:01:32.220> hopefully

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
want larger gravel stuff they hopefully

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.450 
want larger gravel stuff they hopefully
can't<00:01:32.909> eat<00:01:33.210> so<00:01:34.020> you<00:01:34.079> can<00:01:34.439> find<00:01:34.680> turtle<00:01:35.040> gravel

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
can't eat so you can find turtle gravel

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.480 
can't eat so you can find turtle gravel
or<00:01:35.780> larger<00:01:36.780> rocks<00:01:37.079> that<00:01:37.380> they<00:01:37.560> you<00:01:38.280> know<00:01:38.310> that

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
or larger rocks that they you know that

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:39.800 
or larger rocks that they you know that
aren't<00:01:38.640> getting<00:01:38.790> smaller<00:01:39.150> than<00:01:39.420> that<00:01:39.720> they

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
you know one length of their body you

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.580 
you know one length of their body you
want<00:01:59.820> to<00:01:59.909> have<00:02:00.030> a<00:02:00.060> good<00:02:00.570> good<00:02:00.899> area<00:02:01.229> to<00:02:01.259> swim

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
shell and it's not good obviously so

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:36.020 
shell and it's not good obviously so
they<00:02:34.709> need<00:02:34.860> to<00:02:34.890> be<00:02:35.040> able<00:02:35.130> to<00:02:35.280> get<00:02:35.370> out<00:02:35.489> bask<00:02:35.760> and

they need to be able to get out bask and
get<00:02:36.150> 100<00:02:36.269> percent<00:02:36.540> dry<00:02:36.900> so<00:02:37.709> you<00:02:37.800> can<00:02:37.980> you<00:02:38.099> know

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
get 100 percent dry so you can you know

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.580 
get 100 percent dry so you can you know
make<00:02:38.550> sure<00:02:38.730> to<00:02:38.819> have<00:02:38.940> a<00:02:38.970> dock<00:02:39.269> that<00:02:39.590> allows

kind of sinks and stays wet it has to be
100<00:02:44.790> percent<00:02:44.819> dry<00:02:45.470> then<00:02:46.470> you're<00:02:46.560> going<00:02:46.650> to

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:46.709 
100 percent dry then you're going to

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:49.509 
100 percent dry then you're going to
need<00:02:46.890> proper<00:02:47.340> basking<00:02:47.819> area<00:02:47.910> temperature<00:02:48.510> and

00:02:49.509 --> 00:02:49.519 
need proper basking area temperature and

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:52.759 
need proper basking area temperature and
proper<00:02:50.519> UVB<00:02:51.090> now<00:02:51.690> you<00:02:51.750> can<00:02:51.930> accomplish<00:02:52.200> this<00:02:52.560> a

00:02:52.759 --> 00:02:52.769 
proper UVB now you can accomplish this a

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:57.199 
proper UVB now you can accomplish this a
couple<00:02:53.250> ways<00:02:53.430> I<00:02:54.560> prefer<00:02:55.560> these<00:02:55.769> lights<00:02:56.209> they

and<00:03:11.220> heat<00:03:11.610> the<00:03:12.329> only<00:03:12.569> thing<00:03:12.720> you<00:03:12.810> have<00:03:12.930> to<00:03:13.019> do

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 
and heat the only thing you have to do

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.339 
and heat the only thing you have to do
is<00:03:13.470> put<00:03:14.099> a<00:03:14.130> thermometer<00:03:14.849> in<00:03:15.209> there<00:03:15.360> and<00:03:15.569> if

is put a thermometer in there and if
it's<00:03:16.500> too<00:03:16.709> hot<00:03:16.980> raise<00:03:17.670> the<00:03:17.850> light<00:03:18.000> up<00:03:18.120> a<00:03:18.239> little

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:18.389 
it's too hot raise the light up a little

00:03:18.389 --> 00:03:20.840 
it's too hot raise the light up a little
bit<00:03:18.569> if<00:03:18.750> it's<00:03:18.900> too<00:03:19.079> cold<00:03:19.489> lower<00:03:20.489> the<00:03:20.700> light

bit if it's too cold lower the light
down<00:03:21.030> a<00:03:21.060> little<00:03:21.269> bit<00:03:21.480> and<00:03:21.690> get<00:03:21.870> it<00:03:21.900> to<00:03:22.109> the

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.230 
down a little bit and get it to the

needs very simple you need one light and
you<00:03:27.329> just<00:03:27.510> replace<00:03:27.870> that<00:03:28.109> light<00:03:28.290> about<00:03:28.530> every

00:03:28.759 --> 00:03:28.769 
you just replace that light about every

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:31.879 
you just replace that light about every
six<00:03:29.040> months<00:03:29.370> the<00:03:29.519> UVB<00:03:30.170> stops<00:03:31.170> working<00:03:31.500> about

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:31.889 
six months the UVB stops working about

00:03:31.889 --> 00:03:33.979 
six months the UVB stops working about
after<00:03:32.250> but<00:03:32.700> after<00:03:32.940> about<00:03:33.060> six<00:03:33.389> months<00:03:33.480> or<00:03:33.780> so

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:33.989 
after but after about six months or so

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:35.990 
after but after about six months or so
so<00:03:34.680> you<00:03:34.769> want<00:03:34.920> to<00:03:34.980> replace<00:03:35.220> the<00:03:35.459> bulb<00:03:35.670> every

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 
so you want to replace the bulb every

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.400 
so you want to replace the bulb every
six<00:03:36.239> to<00:03:36.269> nine<00:03:36.450> months<00:03:36.750> even<00:03:36.930> if<00:03:37.079> it's<00:03:37.230> still

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:37.410 
six to nine months even if it's still

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:39.039 
six to nine months even if it's still
giving<00:03:37.680> off<00:03:37.799> light

00:03:39.039 --> 00:03:39.049 
giving off light

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:42.830 
giving off light
the<00:03:40.049> other<00:03:40.200> option<00:03:41.299> this<00:03:42.299> is<00:03:42.450> just<00:03:42.660> sitting

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:42.840 
the other option this is just sitting

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:46.340 
the other option this is just sitting
here<00:03:43.049> but<00:03:43.139> the<00:03:43.230> other<00:03:43.350> option<00:03:43.799> is<00:03:44.040> these<00:03:45.350> kind

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:46.350 
here but the other option is these kind

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:49.550 
here but the other option is these kind
of<00:03:46.440> spiral<00:03:46.889> fluorescent<00:03:47.609> lights<00:03:47.790> and<00:03:48.440> you<00:03:49.440> can

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:49.560 
of spiral fluorescent lights and you can

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:51.080 
of spiral fluorescent lights and you can
get<00:03:49.680> the<00:03:49.799> ones<00:03:49.980> that<00:03:50.130> are<00:03:50.340> the<00:03:50.400> reptile<00:03:50.790> and

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.090 
get the ones that are the reptile and

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:54.349 
get the ones that are the reptile and
they<00:03:51.690> should<00:03:51.870> give<00:03:52.049> you<00:03:52.200> V<00:03:52.319> B<00:03:52.670> but<00:03:53.670> the<00:03:53.940> problem

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:54.359 
they should give you V B but the problem

00:03:54.359 --> 00:03:57.650 
they should give you V B but the problem
is<00:03:54.510> these<00:03:55.079> just<00:03:55.530> aren't<00:03:55.769> as<00:03:55.859> good<00:03:56.540> and<00:03:57.540> they

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:57.660 
is these just aren't as good and they

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:59.539 
is these just aren't as good and they
don't<00:03:57.780> give<00:03:57.959> heated<00:03:58.349> either<00:03:58.590> so<00:03:59.040> if<00:03:59.250> you<00:03:59.400> have

00:03:59.539 --> 00:03:59.549 
don't give heated either so if you have

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:02.180 
don't give heated either so if you have
one<00:03:59.700> of<00:03:59.790> these<00:04:00.349> that's<00:04:01.349> fine<00:04:01.709> I<00:04:01.739> mean<00:04:02.040> they<00:04:02.130> do

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:02.190 
one of these that's fine I mean they do

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:03.620 
one of these that's fine I mean they do
work<00:04:02.579> but<00:04:02.819> they're<00:04:02.970> they<00:04:03.120> don't<00:04:03.150> give<00:04:03.389> as<00:04:03.510> much

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:03.630 
work but they're they don't give as much

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:05.210 
work but they're they don't give as much
UVB<00:04:04.049> there's<00:04:04.260> not<00:04:04.440> as<00:04:04.560> good<00:04:04.799> as<00:04:04.950> the<00:04:05.099> other

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:05.220 
UVB there's not as good as the other

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:07.819 
UVB there's not as good as the other
light<00:04:05.430> I<00:04:05.459> just<00:04:05.760> showed<00:04:06.319> but<00:04:07.319> if<00:04:07.410> you<00:04:07.500> use<00:04:07.650> one

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:07.829 
light I just showed but if you use one

00:04:07.829 --> 00:04:09.620 
light I just showed but if you use one
of<00:04:07.859> those<00:04:07.980> that's<00:04:08.190> fine<00:04:08.489> but<00:04:09.150> now<00:04:09.299> you<00:04:09.359> need<00:04:09.540> a

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:09.630 
of those that's fine but now you need a

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:11.720 
of those that's fine but now you need a
second<00:04:09.989> light<00:04:10.139> of<00:04:10.620> asking<00:04:11.220> light<00:04:11.370> to<00:04:11.579> give

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:11.730 
second light of asking light to give

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:13.069 
second light of asking light to give
heat<00:04:11.970> because<00:04:12.269> these<00:04:12.450> do<00:04:12.660> not<00:04:12.690> give<00:04:12.989> enough

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:13.079 
heat because these do not give enough

00:04:13.079 --> 00:04:14.659 
heat because these do not give enough
heat<00:04:13.410> for<00:04:13.560> the<00:04:13.650> basking<00:04:14.010> area<00:04:14.130> so<00:04:14.459> you<00:04:14.519> need

00:04:14.659 --> 00:04:14.669 
heat for the basking area so you need

00:04:14.669 --> 00:04:16.729 
heat for the basking area so you need
two<00:04:14.880> lights<00:04:15.150> if<00:04:15.840> you're<00:04:16.049> going<00:04:16.169> to<00:04:16.229> use<00:04:16.410> one<00:04:16.620> of

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:16.739 
two lights if you're going to use one of

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:18.949 
two lights if you're going to use one of
these<00:04:16.859> instead<00:04:17.849> of<00:04:18.000> one<00:04:18.120> light<00:04:18.329> you<00:04:18.690> need<00:04:18.810> two

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:18.959 
these instead of one light you need two

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:22.940 
these instead of one light you need two
UVB<00:04:19.560> and<00:04:19.739> a<00:04:20.579> heat<00:04:20.789> light<00:04:21.000> so<00:04:21.930> again<00:04:22.590> you<00:04:22.800> would

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:22.950 
UVB and a heat light so again you would

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:26.120 
UVB and a heat light so again you would
set<00:04:23.400> them<00:04:23.550> up<00:04:23.700> test<00:04:23.970> your<00:04:24.150> temperature<00:04:24.539> and

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:26.130 
set them up test your temperature and

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:28.290 
set them up test your temperature and
adjust<00:04:27.130> the<00:04:27.400> height<00:04:27.730> of<00:04:27.790> the<00:04:28.030> light

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:28.300 
adjust the height of the light

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:30.180 
adjust the height of the light
accordingly<00:04:28.990> so<00:04:29.560> you<00:04:29.650> get<00:04:29.800> the<00:04:29.890> proper

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:30.190 
accordingly so you get the proper

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:34.380 
accordingly so you get the proper
temperature<00:04:32.580> other<00:04:33.580> than<00:04:33.820> that<00:04:33.940> you<00:04:34.150> need<00:04:34.300> to

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:34.390 
temperature other than that you need to

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:37.350 
temperature other than that you need to
do<00:04:34.480> water<00:04:34.720> changes<00:04:35.220> every<00:04:36.220> few<00:04:36.550> weeks<00:04:36.610> I'd<00:04:37.090> say

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:37.360 
do water changes every few weeks I'd say

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:38.970 
do water changes every few weeks I'd say
I<00:04:37.630> usually<00:04:37.990> do<00:04:38.080> once<00:04:38.470> or<00:04:38.620> twice<00:04:38.770> a<00:04:38.830> month

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:38.980 
I usually do once or twice a month

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:41.880 
I usually do once or twice a month
myself<00:04:39.580> like<00:04:39.760> a<00:04:39.790> 25%<00:04:40.270> water<00:04:40.750> change<00:04:41.080> because

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:41.890 
myself like a 25% water change because

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:43.410 
myself like a 25% water change because
just<00:04:42.160> like<00:04:42.280> fish<00:04:42.550> the<00:04:42.850> turtles<00:04:43.150> are<00:04:43.240> in<00:04:43.360> the

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:43.420 
just like fish the turtles are in the

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:44.940 
just like fish the turtles are in the
water<00:04:43.600> you<00:04:43.810> don't<00:04:43.930> want<00:04:44.020> really<00:04:44.500> bad<00:04:44.680> water

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:44.950 
water you don't want really bad water

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:46.800 
water you don't want really bad water
quality<00:04:45.460> you<00:04:46.060> want<00:04:46.210> to<00:04:46.300> be<00:04:46.360> changing<00:04:46.720> the

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:46.810 
quality you want to be changing the

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:49.380 
quality you want to be changing the
water<00:04:46.990> and<00:04:47.460> having<00:04:48.460> a<00:04:48.520> good<00:04:48.640> filters<00:04:49.060> so<00:04:49.240> your

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:49.390 
water and having a good filters so your

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:51.570 
water and having a good filters so your
water<00:04:49.480> quality<00:04:49.750> stays<00:04:50.200> good<00:04:50.410> I've<00:04:51.190> got<00:04:51.430> this

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:51.580 
water quality stays good I've got this

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:53.460 
water quality stays good I've got this
little<00:04:51.880> fish<00:04:52.060> in<00:04:52.210> here<00:04:52.360> for<00:04:52.540> my<00:04:52.630> freshwater

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:53.470 
little fish in here for my freshwater

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:56.640 
little fish in here for my freshwater
tank<00:04:53.740> my<00:04:53.890> other<00:04:54.040> tank<00:04:54.310> just<00:04:55.270> helping<00:04:55.630> set<00:04:56.620> up

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:56.650 
tank my other tank just helping set up

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:59.490 
tank my other tank just helping set up
this<00:04:56.920> tank<00:04:57.190> you<00:04:58.150> want<00:04:58.270> to<00:04:58.450> do<00:04:58.600> a<00:04:58.870> couple<00:04:59.290> weeks

00:04:59.490 --> 00:04:59.500 
this tank you want to do a couple weeks

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:02.340 
this tank you want to do a couple weeks
of<00:04:59.800> your<00:05:00.130> filter<00:05:00.460> running<00:05:00.790> and<00:05:00.990> let<00:05:01.990> your<00:05:02.140> tank

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:02.350 
of your filter running and let your tank

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:04.590 
of your filter running and let your tank
cycle<00:05:02.920> just<00:05:03.340> like<00:05:03.460> fish<00:05:03.790> turtles<00:05:04.240> live<00:05:04.510> in

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:04.600 
cycle just like fish turtles live in

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:06.150 
cycle just like fish turtles live in
water<00:05:04.810> and<00:05:05.020> if<00:05:05.080> they<00:05:05.200> got<00:05:05.290> bad<00:05:05.500> water<00:05:05.740> quality

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:06.160 
water and if they got bad water quality

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:07.860 
water and if they got bad water quality
again<00:05:06.340> it<00:05:06.490> can<00:05:06.610> be<00:05:06.640> bad<00:05:06.850> for<00:05:07.120> them<00:05:07.240> so<00:05:07.810> I'm

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:07.870 
again it can be bad for them so I'm

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:09.660 
again it can be bad for them so I'm
letting<00:05:08.110> this<00:05:08.200> tank<00:05:08.440> cycle<00:05:08.830> before<00:05:09.280> I<00:05:09.460> put<00:05:09.640> a

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:09.670 
letting this tank cycle before I put a
