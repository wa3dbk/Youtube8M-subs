so<00:01:24.340> what<00:01:24.520> are<00:01:24.579> you<00:01:24.670> with<00:01:24.880> what<00:01:25.179> makes

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:25.450 
so what are you with what makes

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:27.209 
so what are you with what makes
Shakespeare<00:01:26.049> so<00:01:26.229> different<00:01:26.590> besides<00:01:26.920> for<00:01:27.130> the

00:01:27.209 --> 00:01:27.219 
Shakespeare so different besides for the

00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:29.069 
Shakespeare so different besides for the
language<00:01:27.579> itself<00:01:27.969> compared<00:01:28.630> to<00:01:28.750> some<00:01:28.929> of<00:01:29.020> the

00:01:29.069 --> 00:01:29.079 
language itself compared to some of the

00:01:29.079 --> 00:01:31.440 
language itself compared to some of the
other<00:01:29.229> things<00:01:29.380> you<00:01:29.590> tell<00:01:29.799> it's<00:01:30.280> loaded<00:01:30.969> with

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:31.450 
other things you tell it's loaded with

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:34.380 
other things you tell it's loaded with
meaning<00:01:31.899> and<00:01:32.380> subtext<00:01:33.039> and<00:01:33.609> I<00:01:34.000> think<00:01:34.179> that<00:01:34.299> was

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:34.390 
meaning and subtext and I think that was

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:36.029 
meaning and subtext and I think that was
the<00:01:34.479> secret<00:01:34.659> to<00:01:34.810> actually<00:01:35.140> breaking<00:01:35.950> the

00:01:36.029 --> 00:01:36.039 
the secret to actually breaking the

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:37.529 
the secret to actually breaking the
barrier<00:01:36.310> back<00:01:36.459> to<00:01:36.549> trying<00:01:36.729> to<00:01:36.789> memorize<00:01:37.209> the

00:01:37.529 --> 00:01:37.539 
barrier back to trying to memorize the

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:40.800 
barrier back to trying to memorize the
dialogue<00:01:38.500> was<00:01:38.799> you<00:01:39.729> have<00:01:39.909> to<00:01:40.030> understand<00:01:40.569> what

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:40.810 
dialogue was you have to understand what

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:42.359 
dialogue was you have to understand what
it<00:01:40.929> is<00:01:40.990> you're<00:01:41.170> saying<00:01:41.409> it<00:01:41.530> is<00:01:41.649> certain<00:01:42.069> I<00:01:42.280> am

00:01:42.359 --> 00:01:42.369 
it is you're saying it is certain I am

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:46.109

well<00:01:46.840> pretty<00:01:47.349> much<00:01:47.560> anytime<00:01:48.159> Joss<00:01:48.640> calls<00:01:48.969> and

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:49.270 
well pretty much anytime Joss calls and

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:51.209 
well pretty much anytime Joss calls and
says<00:01:49.509> do<00:01:49.719> you<00:01:49.810> want<00:01:49.840> to<00:01:50.020> do<00:01:50.170> something<00:01:50.649> I<00:01:50.860> I

00:01:51.209 --> 00:01:51.219 
says do you want to do something I I

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:53.069 
says do you want to do something I I
usually<00:01:51.759> say<00:01:51.969> yes<00:01:52.149> before<00:01:52.390> he's<00:01:52.689> actually

00:01:53.069 --> 00:01:53.079 
usually say yes before he's actually

00:01:53.079 --> 00:01:54.779 
usually say yes before he's actually
asked<00:01:53.319> a<00:01:53.530> question<00:01:53.679> and<00:01:54.159> then<00:01:54.280> it's<00:01:54.489> awkward

00:01:54.779 --> 00:01:54.789 
asked a question and then it's awkward

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:56.160 
asked a question and then it's awkward
because<00:01:54.969> he<00:01:55.239> didn't<00:01:55.450> really<00:01:55.569> want<00:01:55.780> me<00:01:55.869> to<00:01:55.989> do

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:56.170 
because he didn't really want me to do

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:03.179 
because he didn't really want me to do
anything<00:01:58.020> but<00:01:59.250> so<00:02:00.360> this<00:02:01.360> happened<00:02:01.899> also<00:02:02.739> to<00:02:03.039> be

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:03.189 
anything but so this happened also to be

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:05.399 
anything but so this happened also to be
a<00:02:03.219> part<00:02:03.399> that<00:02:03.909> I've<00:02:04.030> always<00:02:04.599> wanted<00:02:05.049> to<00:02:05.289> play

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:05.409 
a part that I've always wanted to play

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:08.309 
a part that I've always wanted to play
