now<00:00:00.299> that<00:00:00.810> your<00:00:00.989> Luke<00:00:01.199> Skywalker<00:00:01.740> has<00:00:02.100> some

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:02.310 
now that your Luke Skywalker has some

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:04.670 
now that your Luke Skywalker has some
limbs<00:00:02.580> let's<00:00:03.210> get<00:00:03.389> started<00:00:03.720> on<00:00:03.870> details<00:00:04.319> like

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:04.680 
limbs let's get started on details like

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:07.249 
limbs let's get started on details like
boots<00:00:04.980> and<00:00:05.250> things<00:00:05.370> like<00:00:05.640> that<00:00:05.839> so<00:00:06.839> the<00:00:07.049> first

00:00:07.249 --> 00:00:07.259 
boots and things like that so the first

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:08.930 
boots and things like that so the first
thing<00:00:07.440> I'm<00:00:07.560> gonna<00:00:07.680> do<00:00:07.980> is<00:00:08.010> make<00:00:08.280> his<00:00:08.670> black

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:08.940 
thing I'm gonna do is make his black

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.499 
thing I'm gonna do is make his black
gloves<00:00:09.360> and<00:00:09.570> his<00:00:10.050> black<00:00:10.320> boots<00:00:10.759> so<00:00:11.759> I'll<00:00:12.120> pull

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
gloves and his black boots so I'll pull

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:15.770 
gloves and his black boots so I'll pull
out<00:00:12.750> two<00:00:13.110> black<00:00:13.440> pipe<00:00:13.769> cleaners<00:00:14.250> and<00:00:14.610> this<00:00:15.599> is

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
out two black pipe cleaners and this is

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:17.269 
out two black pipe cleaners and this is
a<00:00:15.809> technique<00:00:16.230> that<00:00:16.289> I<00:00:16.470> used<00:00:16.680> for<00:00:16.890> glove<00:00:17.100> and

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
a technique that I used for glove and

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:19.970 
a technique that I used for glove and
boots<00:00:17.430> watch<00:00:17.789> closely<00:00:18.210> children<00:00:18.779> you<00:00:19.650> fold

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
boots watch closely children you fold

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.720 
boots watch closely children you fold
both<00:00:20.160> of<00:00:20.369> them<00:00:20.550> in<00:00:20.730> half<00:00:21.029> like<00:00:21.390> this<00:00:21.420> and<00:00:22.730> then

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
both of them in half like this and then

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.779 
both of them in half like this and then
cut<00:00:24.119> right<00:00:25.109> there<00:00:25.140> so<00:00:25.740> I<00:00:25.769> may<00:00:25.920> have<00:00:25.949> four<00:00:26.430> equal

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
cut right there so I may have four equal

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:29.599 
cut right there so I may have four equal
pieces<00:00:27.000> then<00:00:27.900> you<00:00:27.930> fold<00:00:28.529> down<00:00:28.830> the<00:00:28.859> four<00:00:29.250> equal

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
pieces then you fold down the four equal

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:32.330 
pieces then you fold down the four equal
pieces<00:00:29.929> to<00:00:30.929> right<00:00:31.380> about<00:00:31.650> the<00:00:31.830> same<00:00:32.040> length

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
pieces to right about the same length

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.700 
pieces to right about the same length
exact<00:00:33.030> doesn't<00:00:33.390> really<00:00:33.510> need<00:00:33.719> to<00:00:33.780> be<00:00:33.899> it

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
exact doesn't really need to be it

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.350 
exact doesn't really need to be it
doesn't<00:00:35.010> need<00:00:35.130> to<00:00:35.219> be<00:00:35.340> really<00:00:35.640> all<00:00:35.790> that<00:00:35.940> exact

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
doesn't need to be really all that exact

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.340 
doesn't need to be really all that exact
and<00:00:36.719> you<00:00:37.350> cut<00:00:37.649> all<00:00:37.950> along<00:00:38.219> metal<00:00:38.750> so<00:00:39.750> now<00:00:39.930> you

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
and you cut all along metal so now you

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.240 
and you cut all along metal so now you
have<00:00:40.559> all<00:00:40.590> these<00:00:40.890> little<00:00:41.040> boots<00:00:41.399> and<00:00:41.610> things

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:43.250 
have all these little boots and things

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:45.950 
have all these little boots and things
so<00:00:44.250> I'll<00:00:44.340> fold<00:00:44.579> this<00:00:44.789> down<00:00:44.850> just<00:00:45.600> to<00:00:45.690> get<00:00:45.809> the

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
so I'll fold this down just to get the

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.630 
so I'll fold this down just to get the
right<00:00:46.110> about<00:00:46.350> size<00:00:46.590> don't<00:00:47.010> be<00:00:47.129> afraid<00:00:47.430> to<00:00:47.550> make

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
right about size don't be afraid to make

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.490 
right about size don't be afraid to make
your<00:00:47.850> look<00:00:48.030> a<00:00:48.149> little<00:00:48.360> bigger<00:00:48.539> taller<00:00:48.930> doesn't

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
your look a little bigger taller doesn't

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.950 
your look a little bigger taller doesn't
really<00:00:49.649> matter<00:00:49.890> and<00:00:50.219> we'll<00:00:50.910> just<00:00:51.149> simply<00:00:51.539> roll

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
really matter and we'll just simply roll

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:58.580 
really matter and we'll just simply roll
around<00:00:52.199> until<00:00:54.860> it's<00:00:55.860> covered<00:00:57.050> so<00:00:58.050> just<00:00:58.410> fold

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
around until it's covered so just fold

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:03.680 
around until it's covered so just fold
this<00:00:58.800> down<00:00:59.129> and<00:01:00.260> roll<00:01:01.260> this<00:01:01.440> around<00:01:01.649> and<00:01:02.690> you

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
this down and roll this around and you

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.149 
this down and roll this around and you
have<00:01:04.610> his<00:01:05.610> little<00:01:05.909> gloves<00:01:06.560> now<00:01:07.560> let's<00:01:07.979> get

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
started on the boots now this is pretty

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:12.830 
started on the boots now this is pretty
much<00:01:11.460> the<00:01:11.640> same<00:01:11.790> as<00:01:11.939> the<00:01:12.030> arms<00:01:12.360> except<00:01:12.659> for<00:01:12.780> at

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
much the same as the arms except for at

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.260 
much the same as the arms except for at
the<00:01:12.960> end<00:01:12.990> you'll<00:01:13.350> make<00:01:13.530> some<00:01:13.740> feet<00:01:14.060> so<00:01:15.060> you'll

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
worried if you don't have a thin white

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.760 
worried if you don't have a thin white
it<00:01:46.920> doesn't<00:01:47.130> really<00:01:47.369> matter<00:01:47.640> so<00:01:48.619> we'll<00:01:49.619> get

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
it doesn't really matter so we'll get

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.429 
it doesn't really matter so we'll get
two<00:01:49.979> white<00:01:50.549> thin<00:01:50.820> ones<00:01:51.060> like<00:01:51.299> this<00:01:51.630> and<00:01:51.930> use

two white thin ones like this and use

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:55.160 
two white thin ones like this and use
this<00:01:52.680> to<00:01:52.860> make<00:01:53.040> his<00:01:53.189> pilot<00:01:53.700> vest<00:01:54.049> so<00:01:55.049> we'll

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
this to make his pilot vest so we'll

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.300 
this to make his pilot vest so we'll
just<00:01:55.350> wrap<00:01:55.500> it<00:01:55.560> around<00:01:55.740> his<00:01:56.070> chest<00:01:58.070> just<00:01:59.070> keep
