00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
which is kind of good because I like the

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.350 
which is kind of good because I like the
way<00:00:43.829> this<00:00:43.980> looks<00:00:44.129> better<00:00:44.340> but<00:00:44.610> again<00:00:44.910> it's

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
way this looks better but again it's

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:50.270 
way this looks better but again it's
smart<00:00:45.600> stupid<00:00:46.670> smart<00:00:48.620> it<00:00:49.620> does<00:00:49.800> have<00:00:49.980> a<00:00:50.010> lot<00:00:50.250> of

smart stupid smart it does have a lot of
power<00:00:50.520> and<00:00:50.760> that<00:00:50.910> downforce<00:00:51.420> is<00:00:51.980> crucial<00:00:52.980> to

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
power and that downforce is crucial to

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.090

truly a beast of a car going around the

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.929 
truly a beast of a car going around the
track<00:02:00.719> is<00:02:01.020> where<00:02:01.259> it<00:02:01.380> really<00:02:01.560> shines<00:02:01.939> you're

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
track is where it really shines you're

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:04.340 
track is where it really shines you're
gonna<00:02:03.060> see<00:02:03.270> me<00:02:03.390> actually<00:02:03.600> struggle<00:02:04.259> with

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
gonna see me actually struggle with

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:05.370 
gonna see me actually struggle with
braking<00:02:04.799> distance

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:05.380 
braking distance

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:07.800 
braking distance
on<00:02:05.560> this<00:02:05.680> one<00:02:05.799> because<00:02:06.100> the<00:02:06.909> braking<00:02:07.360> zones<00:02:07.600> on

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:07.810 
on this one because the braking zones on

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:10.499 
on this one because the braking zones on
this<00:02:07.960> car<00:02:08.170> are<00:02:08.349> very<00:02:09.160> very<00:02:09.489> short<00:02:09.910> and<00:02:10.149> it

00:02:10.499 --> 00:02:10.509 
this car are very very short and it

this car are very very short and it
picks<00:02:10.750> up<00:02:10.869> speed<00:02:11.020> as<00:02:11.440> you<00:02:11.860> would<00:02:11.980> guess<00:02:12.190> really

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:12.880 
picks up speed as you would guess really

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:15.059 
picks up speed as you would guess really
quick<00:02:13.300> so<00:02:13.989> coming<00:02:14.290> out<00:02:14.349> of<00:02:14.470> these<00:02:14.530> corners<00:02:14.950> you

00:02:15.059 --> 00:02:15.069 
quick so coming out of these corners you

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:16.710 
quick so coming out of these corners you
know<00:02:15.099> you<00:02:15.760> places<00:02:16.300> where<00:02:16.420> you'd<00:02:16.540> lay

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 
know you places where you'd lay

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:18.300 
know you places where you'd lay
full<00:02:17.019> throttle<00:02:17.440> on<00:02:17.560> you<00:02:17.680> do<00:02:17.830> it<00:02:17.950> here<00:02:18.160> and

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 
full throttle on you do it here and

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:20.460 
full throttle on you do it here and
there<00:02:19.269> you're<00:02:19.599> going<00:02:19.780> too<00:02:19.930> fast<00:02:20.110> you<00:02:20.349> have<00:02:20.410> to

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:20.470 
there you're going too fast you have to

great and that little green bar I don't

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:39.750 
great and that little green bar I don't
know<00:03:36.430> where<00:03:36.579> it<00:03:36.670> came<00:03:36.760> from<00:03:36.819> but<00:03:38.549> fully<00:03:39.549> built

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:39.760 
know where it came from but fully built

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:41.789 
know where it came from but fully built
up<00:03:39.970> 775<00:03:40.780> horsepower<00:03:41.139> for<00:03:41.319> him<00:03:41.410> to<00:03:41.500> enforce

00:03:41.789 --> 00:03:41.799 
up 775 horsepower for him to enforce

00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:43.490 
up 775 horsepower for him to enforce
yeah<00:03:41.980> yeah<00:03:42.069> yeah<00:03:42.220> I<00:03:42.250> can<00:03:42.400> read<00:03:42.519> that

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:43.500 
yeah yeah yeah I can read that

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:45.990 
yeah yeah yeah I can read that
unfortunately<00:03:44.500> you<00:03:44.590> cannot<00:03:44.889> see<00:03:45.220> the<00:03:45.519> twin

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:46.000 
unfortunately you cannot see the twin

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.599 
unfortunately you cannot see the twin
turbo<00:03:46.389> kit<00:03:46.750> on<00:03:46.930> the<00:03:47.139> car<00:03:47.350> so<00:03:47.769> it's<00:03:48.280> kind<00:03:48.430> of<00:03:48.459> one

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:48.609 
turbo kit on the car so it's kind of one

00:03:48.609 --> 00:03:50.520 
turbo kit on the car so it's kind of one
of<00:03:48.670> the<00:03:48.730> things<00:03:48.940> you<00:03:49.120> know<00:03:49.239> ports<00:03:49.630> if<00:03:50.260> you<00:03:50.410> can

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:50.530 
of the things you know ports if you can

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:52.500 
of the things you know ports if you can
see<00:03:50.650> the<00:03:50.829> engine<00:03:51.220> the<00:03:51.670> probably<00:03:52.000> not<00:03:52.120> engine

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:52.510 
see the engine the probably not engine

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:54.720 
see the engine the probably not engine
swap<00:03:52.750> saying<00:03:53.139> you<00:03:53.380> know<00:03:53.560> you<00:03:54.430> won't<00:03:54.489> be<00:03:54.609> able

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:54.730 
swap saying you know you won't be able

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:56.460 
swap saying you know you won't be able
to<00:03:54.850> see<00:03:54.970> any<00:03:55.150> visual<00:03:55.450> modifications<00:03:56.079> done<00:03:56.230> to

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:56.470 
to see any visual modifications done to

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:57.059 
to see any visual modifications done to
it

00:03:57.059 --> 00:03:57.069 
it

00:03:57.069 --> 00:04:00.380 
it
so<00:03:57.610> that's<00:03:57.790> kind<00:03:58.090> of<00:03:58.150> a<00:03:58.269> thing<00:03:58.659> drag<00:03:58.900> racing

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:00.390 
so that's kind of a thing drag racing

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:02.520 
so that's kind of a thing drag racing
probably<00:04:01.390> should<00:04:01.540> meet<00:04:01.719> of<00:04:01.810> the<00:04:01.870> five<00:04:02.079> speed<00:04:02.409> I

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:02.530 
probably should meet of the five speed I

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:04.709 
probably should meet of the five speed I
kept<00:04:02.799> it<00:04:02.920> six<00:04:03.159> speed<00:04:03.400> and<00:04:03.730> it<00:04:04.000> just<00:04:04.239> did<00:04:04.689> not

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:04.719 
kept it six speed and it just did not

00:04:04.719 --> 00:04:07.229 
kept it six speed and it just did not
work<00:04:05.019> out<00:04:05.560> but<00:04:06.159> I<00:04:06.189> did<00:04:06.459> manage<00:04:06.579> to<00:04:06.700> pull<00:04:06.939> out<00:04:07.090> at

00:04:07.229 --> 00:04:07.239 
work out but I did manage to pull out at

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:10.199 
work out but I did manage to pull out at
eight<00:04:07.450> point<00:04:07.930> six<00:04:08.379> eight<00:04:08.650> three<00:04:08.680> so<00:04:09.250> extremely

00:04:10.199 --> 00:04:10.209 
eight point six eight three so extremely

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:13.229 
eight point six eight three so extremely
fast<00:04:10.659> little<00:04:10.870> car<00:04:11.640> and<00:04:12.640> that's<00:04:12.730> because<00:04:13.030> there

00:04:13.229 --> 00:04:13.239 
fast little car and that's because there

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:15.539 
fast little car and that's because there
is<00:04:13.420> no<00:04:13.450> tie<00:04:13.989> with<00:04:14.230> upgrades<00:04:14.709> so<00:04:15.129> if<00:04:15.280> I<00:04:15.370> could

00:04:15.539 --> 00:04:15.549 
is no tie with upgrades so if I could

00:04:15.549 --> 00:04:17.400 
is no tie with upgrades so if I could
have<00:04:15.670> increased<00:04:16.150> the<00:04:16.329> time<00:04:16.509> with<00:04:16.690> just<00:04:17.289> a

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:17.410 
have increased the time with just a

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:19.560 
have increased the time with just a
little<00:04:17.739> bit<00:04:17.889> I<00:04:18.100> think<00:04:18.789> we<00:04:18.910> could<00:04:19.090> have<00:04:19.180> walked

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:19.570 
little bit I think we could have walked

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:21.659 
little bit I think we could have walked
away<00:04:19.750> with<00:04:20.019> an<00:04:20.139> extremely<00:04:20.709> extremely<00:04:21.400> fast

00:04:21.659 --> 00:04:21.669 
away with an extremely extremely fast

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:23.580 
away with an extremely extremely fast
car<00:04:21.940> and<00:04:22.360> obviously<00:04:22.960> you<00:04:23.139> can't<00:04:23.320> make<00:04:23.470> an

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:23.590 
car and obviously you can't make an

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:24.870 
car and obviously you can't make an
all-wheel<00:04:23.889> drive<00:04:24.070> but<00:04:24.220> who<00:04:24.310> the<00:04:24.669> wants

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:24.880 
all-wheel drive but who the wants

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:26.840 
all-wheel drive but who the wants
to<00:04:24.970> drive<00:04:25.150> new<00:04:25.360> wheel<00:04:25.630> drive<00:04:25.960> in<00:04:26.199> a<00:04:26.289> drag<00:04:26.500> race

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:26.850 
to drive new wheel drive in a drag race

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:29.490 
to drive new wheel drive in a drag race
people<00:04:27.850> who<00:04:27.940> can't<00:04:28.240> tune<00:04:28.539> rear-wheel<00:04:28.960> drive

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:29.500 
people who can't tune rear-wheel drive

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:33.029 
people who can't tune rear-wheel drive
that's<00:04:29.860> who<00:04:31.380> but<00:04:32.380> going<00:04:32.500> around<00:04:32.650> the<00:04:32.800> track<00:04:32.919> in

00:04:33.029 --> 00:04:33.039 
that's who but going around the track in

00:04:33.039 --> 00:04:35.370 
that's who but going around the track in
this<00:04:33.250> thing<00:04:33.460> I<00:04:33.789> ran<00:04:34.330> into<00:04:34.570> a<00:04:34.599> lot<00:04:34.900> of<00:04:34.960> problems

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:35.380 
this thing I ran into a lot of problems

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:37.620 
this thing I ran into a lot of problems
one<00:04:35.620> the<00:04:35.800> braking<00:04:36.160> zones<00:04:36.430> are<00:04:36.729> even<00:04:37.240> smaller

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:37.630 
one the braking zones are even smaller

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:40.980 
one the braking zones are even smaller
and<00:04:37.930> this<00:04:38.410> thing<00:04:38.710> is<00:04:39.070> a<00:04:39.340> monster<00:04:40.180> around<00:04:40.870> the

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:40.990 
and this thing is a monster around the

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:42.689 
and this thing is a monster around the
 course<00:04:41.650> and<00:04:41.919> sorry<00:04:42.310> in<00:04:42.460> the<00:04:42.550> mic

00:04:42.689 --> 00:04:42.699 
 course and sorry in the mic

00:04:42.699 --> 00:04:46.310 
 course and sorry in the mic
that<00:04:42.729> I<00:04:43.150> don't<00:04:43.630> like<00:04:43.780> for<00:04:43.960> your<00:04:44.080> accordionist

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:46.320 
that I don't like for your accordionist

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:50.520 
that I don't like for your accordionist
and<00:04:47.320> third<00:04:47.860> gear<00:04:48.160> it<00:04:48.460> was<00:04:48.729> a<00:04:49.110> it<00:04:50.110> was

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:50.530 
and third gear it was a it was

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:52.680 
and third gear it was a it was
breaking<00:04:50.889> loose<00:04:51.130> even<00:04:51.820> with<00:04:51.940> the<00:04:52.030> tires<00:04:52.270> fully

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:52.690 
breaking loose even with the tires fully

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:55.080 
breaking loose even with the tires fully
warm<00:04:53.050> you<00:04:53.440> know<00:04:53.470> it's<00:04:54.250> just<00:04:54.400> too<00:04:54.699> much<00:04:54.820> power

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:55.090 
warm you know it's just too much power

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:58.170 
warm you know it's just too much power
for<00:04:55.449> too<00:04:56.349> much<00:04:56.440> time<00:04:56.740> or<00:04:56.949> too<00:04:57.160> much<00:04:57.639> power<00:04:57.970> for

00:04:58.170 --> 00:04:58.180 
for too much time or too much power for

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:00.300 
for too much time or too much power for
those<00:04:58.270> little<00:04:58.449> tires<00:04:58.780> I<00:04:59.169> need<00:04:59.860> to<00:04:59.919> go<00:05:00.039> to<00:05:00.099> bed<00:05:00.280> I

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:00.310 
those little tires I need to go to bed I

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:03.839 
those little tires I need to go to bed I
really<00:05:00.759> be<00:05:00.910> but<00:05:01.720> I<00:05:02.760> could<00:05:03.760> have

00:05:03.839 --> 00:05:03.849 
really be but I could have

00:05:03.849 --> 00:05:05.700 
really be but I could have
probably<00:05:03.940> fixed<00:05:04.419> it<00:05:04.479> by<00:05:04.630> making<00:05:04.840> this<00:05:05.169> you

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:05.710 
probably fixed it by making this you

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:07.529 
probably fixed it by making this you
know<00:05:05.830> the<00:05:05.949> track<00:05:06.190> version<00:05:06.430> of<00:05:06.669> this<00:05:06.789> as<00:05:07.030> no<00:05:07.510> a

00:05:07.529 --> 00:05:07.539 
know the track version of this as no a

00:05:07.539 --> 00:05:10.379 
know the track version of this as no a
5-speed<00:05:08.080> as<00:05:08.229> well<00:05:08.530> I<00:05:08.770> might<00:05:09.760> end<00:05:09.940> up<00:05:10.120> doing

00:05:10.379 --> 00:05:10.389 
5-speed as well I might end up doing

00:05:10.389 --> 00:05:12.510 
5-speed as well I might end up doing
that<00:05:10.539> but<00:05:10.720> as<00:05:10.900> of<00:05:11.229> right<00:05:11.349> now<00:05:11.409> if<00:05:11.740> you<00:05:11.889> do<00:05:12.099> find

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:12.520 
that but as of right now if you do find

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:15.210 
that but as of right now if you do find
this<00:05:12.820> tune<00:05:13.120> on<00:05:13.419> you<00:05:13.930> know<00:05:14.050> whatever<00:05:14.889> it<00:05:15.130> is
