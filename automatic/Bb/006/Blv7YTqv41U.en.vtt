00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
now I'm going to go through the pros and

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.730 
now I'm going to go through the pros and
cons<00:01:29.189> of<00:01:29.369> this<00:01:29.430> product<00:01:30.030> one<00:01:30.840> big<00:01:31.110> Pro<00:01:31.470> that<00:01:31.710> I

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
cons of this product one big Pro that I

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.289 
cons of this product one big Pro that I
really<00:01:32.159> really<00:01:32.189> like<00:01:32.520> is<00:01:32.759> that<00:01:32.790> the

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
really really like is that the

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.300 
really really like is that the
consistency<00:01:33.900> is<00:01:34.110> really<00:01:34.409> runny<00:01:34.799> and<00:01:34.920> it's

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
consistency is really runny and it's

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.399 
consistency is really runny and it's
very<00:01:35.579> thin<00:01:36.030> and<00:01:36.270> I<00:01:36.600> really<00:01:36.960> like<00:01:37.079> that<00:01:37.229> because

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
very thin and I really like that because

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.080 
very thin and I really like that because
it's<00:01:37.619> much<00:01:37.799> different<00:01:37.979> than<00:01:38.250> any<00:01:38.460> other<00:01:38.579> clay

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
it's much different than any other clay

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.550 
it's much different than any other clay
mask<00:01:39.329> I<00:01:39.479> views<00:01:39.720> because<00:01:39.869> typically<00:01:40.259> when<00:01:40.530> a

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
mask I views because typically when a

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.530 
mask I views because typically when a
mask<00:01:40.829> says<00:01:41.100> it's<00:01:41.280> a<00:01:41.340> clay<00:01:41.549> mask<00:01:41.729> it's<00:01:42.240> a<00:01:42.329> very

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
mask says it's a clay mask it's a very

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.600 
mask says it's a clay mask it's a very
thick<00:01:43.079> and<00:01:43.290> I<00:01:43.710> like<00:01:43.920> that<00:01:44.040> this<00:01:44.159> one's<00:01:44.399> thin

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
thick and I like that this one's thin

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.370 
thick and I like that this one's thin
because<00:01:44.759> it's<00:01:44.970> much<00:01:45.329> much<00:01:45.570> easier<00:01:45.630> to<00:01:46.110> apply<00:01:46.320> a

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
because it's much much easier to apply a

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.530 
because it's much much easier to apply a
thin<00:01:46.770> layer<00:01:46.979> and<00:01:47.399> make<00:01:47.579> it<00:01:47.729> even<00:01:48.119> so<00:01:48.299> that<00:01:48.450> it

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
thin layer and make it even so that it

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.090 
thin layer and make it even so that it
dries<00:01:48.810> evenly<00:01:49.259> I<00:01:49.439> feel<00:01:49.770> like<00:01:49.890> when<00:01:50.009> I<00:01:50.070> used

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
dries evenly I feel like when I used

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.560 
dries evenly I feel like when I used
other<00:01:50.399> clay<00:01:50.610> masks<00:01:51.000> I<00:01:51.090> put<00:01:51.270> it<00:01:51.360> on<00:01:51.509> really

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
other clay masks I put it on really

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.270 
other clay masks I put it on really
uneven<00:01:52.170> Lee<00:01:52.380> and<00:01:52.590> then<00:01:52.680> it<00:01:52.799> takes<00:01:52.979> forever<00:01:53.130> for

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
uneven Lee and then it takes forever for

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.830 
uneven Lee and then it takes forever for
one<00:01:53.610> spot<00:01:53.850> to<00:01:53.970> dry<00:01:54.149> and<00:01:54.329> then<00:01:54.390> that<00:01:54.570> breast

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
one spot to dry and then that breast

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.840 
one spot to dry and then that breast
isn't<00:01:55.170> drying<00:01:55.409> but<00:01:55.890> this<00:01:56.009> one<00:01:56.189> dried<00:01:56.460> so

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
isn't drying but this one dried so

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.490 
isn't drying but this one dried so
evenly<00:01:57.270> everything<00:01:57.750> was<00:01:57.869> completely<00:01:58.140> dry

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
evenly everything was completely dry

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.160 
evenly everything was completely dry
within<00:01:58.829> like<00:01:59.219> 13<00:01:59.700> minutes<00:02:00.000> after<00:02:00.750> taking<00:02:00.960> it

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170

was much less red and it also didn't
look<00:02:50.489> like<00:02:50.549> it<00:02:50.700> was<00:02:50.819> popping<00:02:51.150> out<00:02:51.209> of<00:02:51.329> my<00:02:51.420> face

as<00:02:51.810> much<00:02:52.019> right<00:02:52.290> away<00:02:52.319> I<00:02:52.530> felt<00:02:52.650> like<00:02:53.069> it<00:02:53.340> wasn't

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
as much right away I felt like it wasn't

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:55.849 
as much right away I felt like it wasn't
a<00:02:54.299> pimple<00:02:54.510> anymore<00:02:55.019> it<00:02:55.109> didn't<00:02:55.319> even<00:02:55.379> hurt<00:02:55.680> or

00:02:55.849 --> 00:02:55.859 
a pimple anymore it didn't even hurt or

00:02:55.859 --> 00:02:57.860 
a pimple anymore it didn't even hurt or
anything<00:02:55.890> so<00:02:56.370> that<00:02:56.760> was<00:02:56.970> definitely<00:02:57.359> a<00:02:57.660> pro

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
anything so that was definitely a pro

like it did dry my skin and I'm not sure

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:05.720 
like it did dry my skin and I'm not sure
if<00:03:04.470> it's<00:03:04.560> because<00:03:04.650> I<00:03:04.799> initially<00:03:05.280> have<00:03:05.459> dry

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
if it's because I initially have dry

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:08.240 
if it's because I initially have dry
skin<00:03:06.000> to<00:03:06.150> begin<00:03:06.540> with<00:03:06.750> but<00:03:07.410> I<00:03:07.680> just<00:03:08.010> felt<00:03:08.190> like

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
skin to begin with but I just felt like

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:09.770 
skin to begin with but I just felt like
it<00:03:08.430> was<00:03:08.549> drying<00:03:08.790> my<00:03:08.879> skin<00:03:09.269> I<00:03:09.299> did<00:03:09.629> have<00:03:09.750> a

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 
it was drying my skin I did have a

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:11.330 
it was drying my skin I did have a
little<00:03:09.930> bit<00:03:10.140> of<00:03:10.170> flakes<00:03:10.500> after<00:03:10.859> I<00:03:10.890> took<00:03:10.980> it<00:03:11.220> off

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
little bit of flakes after I took it off

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:13.220 
little bit of flakes after I took it off
and<00:03:11.549> i<00:03:11.819> had<00:03:12.000> to<00:03:12.150> moisturize<00:03:12.599> my<00:03:12.780> skin<00:03:12.810> that

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
and i had to moisturize my skin that

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:15.289 
and i had to moisturize my skin that
night<00:03:13.440> which<00:03:13.890> I<00:03:14.010> do<00:03:14.069> anyway<00:03:14.609> but<00:03:14.910> it's<00:03:15.090> just

00:03:15.289 --> 00:03:15.299 
night which I do anyway but it's just

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:16.610 
night which I do anyway but it's just
definitely<00:03:15.540> something<00:03:16.049> to<00:03:16.170> keep<00:03:16.319> an<00:03:16.440> eye<00:03:16.590> out

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
definitely something to keep an eye out

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:18.979 
definitely something to keep an eye out
for<00:03:17.040> I<00:03:17.280> don't<00:03:17.609> think<00:03:17.700> it's<00:03:18.030> a<00:03:18.120> big<00:03:18.329> con<00:03:18.630> just

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:18.989 
for I don't think it's a big con just

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:20.539 
for I don't think it's a big con just
because<00:03:19.290> you<00:03:19.530> can<00:03:19.709> easily<00:03:19.889> just<00:03:20.190> moisturize

00:03:20.539 --> 00:03:20.549 
because you can easily just moisturize
