00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
taking the thing apart ok I just could

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.750 
taking the thing apart ok I just could
needs<00:00:45.239> to<00:00:45.329> get<00:00:45.420> primed<00:00:45.690> up<00:00:45.870> first<00:00:46.140> so<00:00:47.010> it's<00:00:47.610> got

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
needs to get primed up first so it's got

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.049 
needs to get primed up first so it's got
a<00:00:47.789> little<00:00:48.440> dish<00:00:49.440> at<00:00:49.649> the<00:00:49.680> bottom<00:00:50.039> here<00:00:50.280> I'll

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
a little dish at the bottom here I'll

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.299 
a little dish at the bottom here I'll
just<00:00:51.300> give<00:00:51.480> it<00:00:51.570> a<00:00:51.719> bit<00:00:52.350> of<00:00:52.500> I'm<00:00:53.010> just<00:00:53.160> going<00:00:53.280> to

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
just give it a bit of I'm just going to

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:58.130 
just give it a bit of I'm just going to
give<00:00:53.489> it<00:00:53.579> some<00:00:53.610> methylated<00:00:54.210> spirits<00:00:55.100> and<00:00:57.140> get

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140

give it some methylated spirits and get
it<00:00:58.230> lit<00:00:58.440> up

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.810 

so<00:01:05.040> let's<00:01:05.790> burn<00:01:06.030> away<00:01:06.240> inside<00:01:06.690> there<00:01:06.960> now<00:01:07.820> now

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
so let's burn away inside there now now

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.070 
so let's burn away inside there now now
these<00:01:08.940> things<00:01:09.150> I<00:01:09.390> think<00:01:09.450> this<00:01:09.660> one's<00:01:09.840> from<00:01:10.020> the

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
these things I think this one's from the

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.430 
these things I think this one's from the
early<00:01:10.380> 70s<00:01:11.960> they<00:01:12.960> come<00:01:13.110> in<00:01:13.200> a<00:01:13.260> few<00:01:13.350> different

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:13.440 
early 70s they come in a few different

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:15.560 
early 70s they come in a few different
models<00:01:13.950> as<00:01:14.070> the<00:01:14.220> one-one-one<00:01:14.820> models<00:01:15.390> which

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
models as the one-one-one models which

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.920 
models as the one-one-one models which
are<00:01:15.780> a<00:01:15.840> larger<00:01:16.610> as<00:01:17.610> you<00:01:17.700> can<00:01:17.820> see<00:01:18.000> the<00:01:18.540> size<00:01:18.810> of

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
are a larger as you can see the size of

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.780 
are a larger as you can see the size of
this<00:01:19.050> is<00:01:19.290> about<00:01:21.380> well<00:01:22.380> that<00:01:23.130> it<00:01:23.250> broad<00:01:23.490> as<00:01:23.640> my

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
this is about well that it broad as my

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.230 
this is about well that it broad as my
hand<00:01:24.440> and<00:01:25.440> about<00:01:25.620> that<00:01:25.770> deep<00:01:25.980> so<00:01:26.340> that's<00:01:27.150> the

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
hand and about that deep so that's the

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.990 
hand and about that deep so that's the
kind<00:01:27.420> of<00:01:27.480> dimensions<00:01:28.020> you're<00:01:28.110> looking<00:01:28.350> at<00:01:29.000> all

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
kind of dimensions you're looking at all

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.300 
kind of dimensions you're looking at all
the<00:01:30.090> fittings<00:01:30.300> instead<00:01:30.720> of<00:01:30.810> the<00:01:30.930> tank<00:01:31.200> and<00:01:31.470> all

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
the fittings instead of the tank and all

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.090 
the fittings instead of the tank and all
those<00:01:32.460> fittings<00:01:32.730> inside<00:01:32.940> they're<00:01:33.270> all<00:01:33.390> brass

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:34.100 
those fittings inside they're all brass

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:37.550 
those fittings inside they're all brass
so<00:01:35.100> you<00:01:35.850> can<00:01:36.030> see<00:01:36.330> then<00:01:37.170> whether<00:01:37.320> you<00:01:37.410> noticed

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
so you can see then whether you noticed

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:38.900 
so you can see then whether you noticed
on<00:01:37.860> the<00:01:37.950> top<00:01:38.160> here<00:01:38.369> there's<00:01:38.520> a<00:01:38.550> little<00:01:38.729> bit<00:01:38.820> of

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:38.910 
on the top here there's a little bit of

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:40.880 
on the top here there's a little bit of
singeing<00:01:39.300> on<00:01:39.390> the<00:01:39.479> paint's<00:01:39.810> because<00:01:39.960> the<00:01:40.110> the

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
singeing on the paint's because the the

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.590 
singeing on the paint's because the the
lids<00:01:41.100> of<00:01:41.310> these<00:01:41.490> being<00:01:41.850> closed<00:01:42.119> a<00:01:42.300> few<00:01:42.420> too

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
lids of these being closed a few too

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.620 
lids of these being closed a few too
many<00:01:42.630> times<00:01:43.880> while<00:01:44.880> it's<00:01:45.030> still<00:01:45.240> hot<00:01:45.450> and

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
many times while it's still hot and

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.660 
many times while it's still hot and
scorch<00:01:46.020> the<00:01:46.140> paint<00:01:46.380> and<00:01:46.710> now<00:01:47.160> this<00:01:47.340> is<00:01:47.490> just

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
scorch the paint and now this is just

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.400
