00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:41.400 

so<00:02:39.940> yeah<00:02:40.090> as<00:02:40.300> you<00:02:40.360> can<00:02:40.570> hear<00:02:40.720> the<00:02:40.900> Sun<00:02:41.200> did

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:41.410 
so yeah as you can hear the Sun did

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:43.890 
so yeah as you can hear the Sun did
become<00:02:41.740> weak<00:02:41.920> over<00:02:42.310> here<00:02:42.460> at<00:02:42.730> this<00:02:42.880> spot<00:02:43.210> so
