00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
like Earth and beds and wicking beds now

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:15.799 
like Earth and beds and wicking beds now
wick<00:00:13.860> birthing<00:00:14.549> bed<00:00:14.670> is<00:00:14.849> basically<00:00:15.389> a<00:00:15.420> wicking

bed with water that flows underneath of
the<00:00:19.260> soil<00:00:19.710> I<00:00:22.070> like<00:00:23.150> airlift<00:00:24.150> punks<00:00:24.660> and<00:00:27.260> so

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
the soil I like airlift punks and so

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.680 
the soil I like airlift punks and so
I've<00:00:28.349> combined<00:00:28.830> these<00:00:29.789> two<00:00:29.849> in<00:00:30.480> order<00:00:31.669> to

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:32.690

I've combined these two in order to
create<00:00:33.690> my<00:00:33.960> perfect<00:00:34.440> garden<00:00:35.989> the<00:00:36.989> problem<00:00:37.469> I

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
create my perfect garden the problem I

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.700 
create my perfect garden the problem I
had<00:00:37.860> though<00:00:38.129> is<00:00:38.399> the<00:00:39.329> cost<00:00:39.570> I've<00:00:40.079> been<00:00:40.469> using

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
had though is the cost I've been using

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.790 
had though is the cost I've been using
ibc's<00:00:41.340> and<00:00:41.820> I've<00:00:42.300> been<00:00:42.510> making<00:00:43.050> wooden<00:00:43.350> boxes

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
ibc's and I've been making wooden boxes

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.779 
ibc's and I've been making wooden boxes
with<00:00:44.120> fiberglass<00:00:46.489> fiberglassed<00:00:47.489> wooden

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
with fiberglass fiberglassed wooden

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.990 
with fiberglass fiberglassed wooden
boxes<00:00:48.270> in<00:00:48.480> order<00:00:48.750> to<00:00:48.899> create<00:00:49.440> my<00:00:49.710> my<00:00:50.430> grow<00:00:50.730> beds

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
boxes in order to create my my grow beds

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.840 
boxes in order to create my my grow beds
well<00:00:51.270> a<00:00:51.510> four-by-four<00:00:52.379> error<00:00:52.800> area<00:00:53.370> ends<00:00:53.699> up

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
well a four-by-four error area ends up

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.610 
well a four-by-four error area ends up
costing<00:00:54.239> me<00:00:54.600> like<00:00:54.780> sixty<00:00:55.230> dollars<00:00:55.620> at<00:00:55.829> least

00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:57.620 
costing me like sixty dollars at least

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:02.479 
costing me like sixty dollars at least
so<00:00:58.620> my<00:00:58.739> idea<00:00:58.890> came<00:00:59.340> back<00:00:59.550> to<00:00:59.730> using<00:01:00.500> epdm<00:01:01.500> so<00:01:02.280> if

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
so my idea came back to using epdm so if

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:08.960 
so my idea came back to using epdm so if
this<00:01:03.290> were<00:01:04.290> a<00:01:04.530> trench<00:01:05.129> in<00:01:05.400> the<00:01:05.610> ground<00:01:07.280> and<00:01:08.280> it

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
this were a trench in the ground and it

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.410 
this were a trench in the ground and it
was<00:01:09.060> lined<00:01:09.689> with<00:01:09.840> a<00:01:10.159> Annie<00:01:11.159> PDM<00:01:11.549> pond<00:01:12.090> liner

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
was lined with a Annie PDM pond liner

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:17.230 
was lined with a Annie PDM pond liner
that<00:01:13.670> would<00:01:14.670> create<00:01:14.880> a<00:01:15.000> fairly<00:01:15.600> expensive

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:17.240 
that would create a fairly expensive

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:19.789 
that would create a fairly expensive
tank<00:01:18.240> say<00:01:18.570> about<00:01:18.750> a<00:01:18.810> hundred<00:01:19.049> dollars<00:01:19.560> would

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
tank say about a hundred dollars would

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:24.249 
tank say about a hundred dollars would
easily<00:01:20.490> do<00:01:20.970> a<00:01:21.659> couple<00:01:22.560> of

00:01:24.249 --> 00:01:24.259 
easily do a couple of

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
16-foot grow beds say that beds could be

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.920 
16-foot grow beds say that beds could be
like<00:01:31.079> three<00:01:31.680> feet<00:01:31.890> wide<00:01:32.189> and<00:01:33.000> 16<00:01:33.360> feet<00:01:33.659> long

like three feet wide and 16 feet long
and<00:01:34.970> I<00:01:35.970> go<00:01:36.329> about<00:01:36.509> 20<00:01:36.899> inches<00:01:37.170> deep<00:01:37.409> because

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
and I go about 20 inches deep because

of wat of rock or my water level would

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:48.440 
of wat of rock or my water level would
be<00:01:46.470> at<00:01:46.590> four<00:01:46.890> inches<00:01:47.250> my<00:01:47.460> rock<00:01:47.789> is<00:01:48.000> at<00:01:48.149> six

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
be at four inches my rock is at six

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.969 
be at four inches my rock is at six
inches<00:01:48.689> and<00:01:49.049> then<00:01:49.140> I've<00:01:49.320> got<00:01:49.670> say<00:01:50.670> another

inches and then I've got say another

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:56.779 
inches and then I've got say another
foot<00:01:52.979> of<00:01:53.869> nice<00:01:54.869> soil<00:01:55.140> a<00:01:55.530> combination<00:01:56.369> of<00:01:56.459> sand

00:01:56.779 --> 00:01:56.789 
foot of nice soil a combination of sand

00:01:56.789 --> 00:02:02.570 
foot of nice soil a combination of sand
clay<00:01:57.149> and<00:01:57.390> garden<00:01:58.140> soil<00:02:00.890> ok<00:02:01.890> so<00:02:01.950> this<00:02:02.189> reduces

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:02.580 
clay and garden soil ok so this reduces

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:06.139 
clay and garden soil ok so this reduces
the<00:02:02.880> cost<00:02:03.679> but<00:02:04.679> since<00:02:05.100> i<00:02:05.250> like<00:02:05.459> to<00:02:05.610> use<00:02:05.640> air

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
the cost but since i like to use air

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:09.020 
the cost but since i like to use air
lift<00:02:06.569> pumps<00:02:07.049> rather<00:02:07.259> than<00:02:07.530> mechanical<00:02:08.429> pumps

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
lift pumps rather than mechanical pumps

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.960 
lift pumps rather than mechanical pumps
which<00:02:09.179> in<00:02:09.450> my<00:02:09.630> opinion<00:02:09.780> break<00:02:10.289> down<00:02:10.700> and<00:02:11.700> cause

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
which in my opinion break down and cause

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:17.210 
which in my opinion break down and cause
a<00:02:12.000> lot<00:02:12.209> of<00:02:12.239> trouble<00:02:15.380> air<00:02:16.380> lift<00:02:16.590> pumps<00:02:16.950> to<00:02:17.069> me

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
a lot of trouble air lift pumps to me

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:21.920 
a lot of trouble air lift pumps to me
are<00:02:17.489> are<00:02:17.940> easier<00:02:18.750> to<00:02:18.780> maintain<00:02:19.080> and<00:02:20.930> basically

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
are are easier to maintain and basically

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:26.240 
are are easier to maintain and basically
they<00:02:22.319> cost<00:02:22.560> a<00:02:22.739> lot<00:02:22.860> less<00:02:23.330> so<00:02:24.620> that<00:02:25.620> being<00:02:25.890> said

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
they cost a lot less so that being said

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.280 
they cost a lot less so that being said

inch PVC put a cap on the bottom of it
run<00:02:53.940> it<00:02:54.030> up<00:02:54.180> through<00:02:54.209> a<00:02:54.920> hole<00:02:55.920> that's<00:02:56.160> cut<00:02:56.459> just

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
run it up through a hole that's cut just

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:00.080 
run it up through a hole that's cut just
slightly<00:02:57.000> larger<00:02:57.690> than<00:02:57.720> six<00:02:58.440> inches<00:02:58.739> and<00:02:59.130> run

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
slightly larger than six inches and run

the run it up the side of the pipe a
little<00:03:03.600> bit<00:03:03.780> so<00:03:04.139> that<00:03:04.170> you<00:03:04.440> can<00:03:04.620> clamp<00:03:05.010> it<00:03:05.220> with

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:05.459 
little bit so that you can clamp it with

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:08.750 
little bit so that you can clamp it with
a<00:03:05.489> stainless<00:03:06.000> steel<00:03:06.209> clamp<00:03:07.400> now<00:03:08.400> you've<00:03:08.549> got<00:03:08.730> a

here<00:03:19.340> let<00:03:20.340> it<00:03:20.870> flow<00:03:21.870> into<00:03:22.200> a<00:03:22.230> sister<00:03:23.130> in<00:03:23.190> here

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:23.579 
here let it flow into a sister in here

00:03:23.579 --> 00:03:25.120 
here let it flow into a sister in here
which<00:03:23.910> could<00:03:24.150> be<00:03:24.269> made<00:03:24.450> out<00:03:24.480> of<00:03:24.630> them<00:03:24.810> say<00:03:25.079> a

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:25.130 
which could be made out of them say a

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:32.340 
which could be made out of them say a
55-gallon<00:03:26.150> drum<00:03:27.150> a<00:03:27.420> plastic<00:03:28.290> one<00:03:28.819> and

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:32.350 

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:35.980 

and<00:03:33.350> it<00:03:33.590> would<00:03:33.709> circulate<00:03:34.330> back<00:03:35.330> through<00:03:35.660> here

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:35.990 
and it would circulate back through here

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:38.650 
and it would circulate back through here
and<00:03:36.380> then<00:03:36.950> drain<00:03:37.370> back<00:03:37.640> into<00:03:38.000> the<00:03:38.180> into<00:03:38.569> the

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:38.660 
and then drain back into the into the

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:43.600 
and then drain back into the into the
grow<00:03:38.840> bed<00:03:39.110> which<00:03:40.330> you<00:03:41.330> see<00:03:42.069> show<00:03:43.069> you<00:03:43.130> this<00:03:43.400> I

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:43.610 
grow bed which you see show you this I

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:45.699 
grow bed which you see show you this I
would<00:03:43.790> run<00:03:43.970> that<00:03:44.180> I<00:03:44.360> would<00:03:44.569> run<00:03:44.780> the<00:03:44.990> inlet

00:03:45.699 --> 00:03:45.709 
would run that I would run the inlet

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:53.250 
would run that I would run the inlet
pipe<00:03:45.920> all<00:03:46.190> the<00:03:46.340> way<00:03:46.400> down<00:03:46.610> to<00:03:46.640> the<00:03:46.790> end<00:03:47.709> so<00:03:48.709> that

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:53.260 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:57.900 

pardon<00:03:54.260> me<00:03:54.610> could<00:03:55.610> this<00:03:55.730> in<00:03:55.970> perspective<00:03:56.239> here

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:57.910 
pardon me could this in perspective here

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:02.080 
pardon me could this in perspective here
so<00:03:58.910> that's<00:03:59.120> so<00:03:59.569> that<00:03:59.720> the<00:04:00.310> the<00:04:01.310> intake<00:04:01.790> comes

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:02.090 
so that's so that the the intake comes

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:08.170 
so that's so that the the intake comes
from<00:04:02.270> this<00:04:02.420> other<00:04:02.600> end<00:04:02.959> and<00:04:05.800> flows<00:04:06.800> out<00:04:07.180> and

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:08.180 
from this other end and flows out and

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:11.500 
from this other end and flows out and
then<00:04:08.420> goes<00:04:08.630> all<00:04:08.900> the<00:04:08.930> way<00:04:09.110> down<00:04:09.550> and<00:04:10.550> flows

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:11.510 
then goes all the way down and flows

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:15.610 
then goes all the way down and flows
back<00:04:13.660> creating<00:04:14.660> a<00:04:14.720> nice<00:04:14.870> flow<00:04:15.170> through<00:04:15.440> the

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:15.620 
back creating a nice flow through the

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:21.099 
back creating a nice flow through the
through<00:04:16.040> the<00:04:16.220> rock<00:04:16.430> and<00:04:16.820> use<00:04:17.630> a<00:04:17.660> 2<00:04:17.989> inch<00:04:20.109> to

00:04:21.099 --> 00:04:21.109 
through the rock and use a 2 inch to

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:24.010 
through the rock and use a 2 inch to
inch<00:04:21.140> drain<00:04:21.680> rock<00:04:21.950> seems<00:04:22.250> to<00:04:22.400> be<00:04:22.550> a<00:04:22.910> good<00:04:23.419> good

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:24.020 
inch drain rock seems to be a good good

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:28.690 
inch drain rock seems to be a good good
rock<00:04:24.290> to<00:04:25.090> create<00:04:26.090> this<00:04:26.390> some<00:04:27.460> area<00:04:28.460> for<00:04:28.669> the

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:28.700 
rock to create this some area for the

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:32.290 
rock to create this some area for the
water<00:04:29.030> and<00:04:30.160> this<00:04:31.160> area<00:04:31.550> right<00:04:31.729> here<00:04:31.790> is

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:32.300 
water and this area right here is

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:35.890 
water and this area right here is
basically<00:04:32.570> rock<00:04:33.440> and<00:04:33.770> air<00:04:34.240> this<00:04:35.240> is<00:04:35.450> the<00:04:35.600> water

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:35.900 
basically rock and air this is the water

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:39.700 
basically rock and air this is the water
level<00:04:36.410> down<00:04:36.590> here<00:04:37.010> and<00:04:37.360> the<00:04:38.360> water<00:04:38.990> wicks<00:04:39.440> up

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:39.710 
level down here and the water wicks up

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:43.960 
level down here and the water wicks up
the<00:04:40.550> rock<00:04:40.870> passes<00:04:41.870> through<00:04:42.169> the<00:04:42.470> the<00:04:43.370> membrane

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:43.970 
the rock passes through the the membrane

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:48.130 
the rock passes through the the membrane
of<00:04:44.240> that<00:04:44.960> you<00:04:45.440> could<00:04:45.650> use<00:04:45.680> either<00:04:46.960> drain<00:04:47.960> field

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:48.140 
of that you could use either drain field

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:51.159 
of that you could use either drain field
cloth<00:04:49.010> or<00:04:49.370> shade<00:04:50.060> cloth<00:04:50.240> something<00:04:50.780> like<00:04:50.930> that

00:04:51.159 --> 00:04:51.169 
cloth or shade cloth something like that

00:04:51.169 --> 00:04:54.070 
cloth or shade cloth something like that
to<00:04:51.860> separate<00:04:52.430> this<00:04:52.610> area<00:04:53.030> and<00:04:53.210> then<00:04:53.750> it<00:04:53.870> wicks

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:54.080 
to separate this area and then it wicks

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:59.350 
to separate this area and then it wicks
up<00:04:54.260> into<00:04:54.610> this<00:04:55.610> soil<00:04:56.600> and<00:04:57.760> keeps<00:04:58.760> it<00:04:58.940> at<00:04:59.030> a<00:04:59.060> very

00:04:59.350 --> 00:04:59.360 
up into this soil and keeps it at a very

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:05.620 
up into this soil and keeps it at a very
very<00:04:59.750> nice<00:05:00.580> moisture<00:05:01.580> level<00:05:04.330> so<00:05:05.330> then<00:05:05.479> you

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:05.630 
very nice moisture level so then you

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:08.260 
very nice moisture level so then you
might<00:05:05.870> be<00:05:06.050> asking<00:05:06.470> well<00:05:06.680> why<00:05:07.640> do<00:05:07.700> you<00:05:07.910> even

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:08.270 
might be asking well why do you even

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:10.830 
might be asking well why do you even
need<00:05:08.600> the<00:05:08.870> sister<00:05:09.320> in<00:05:09.440> here<00:05:09.650> why<00:05:09.919> not<00:05:10.160> just

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:10.840 
need the sister in here why not just

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:14.680 
need the sister in here why not just
circulate<00:05:11.840> the<00:05:12.680> water<00:05:13.270> through<00:05:14.270> the<00:05:14.479> grill
