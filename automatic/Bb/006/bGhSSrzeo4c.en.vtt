and you know how to crap and this is I
don't<00:00:06.720> know<00:00:06.870> how<00:00:08.120> to<00:00:09.120> add<00:00:09.420> them<00:00:09.660> to<00:00:10.290> record

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710 
don't know how to add them to record

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.190 
don't know how to add them to record
this<00:00:10.980> so<00:00:11.340> hopefully<00:00:11.849> this<00:00:12.059> time<00:00:12.269> is<00:00:12.719> going<00:00:13.049> to

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
this so hopefully this time is going to

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.970 
this so hopefully this time is going to
be<00:00:13.320> good<00:00:13.530> now<00:00:14.400> it's<00:00:14.759> trying<00:00:14.969> to<00:00:15.420> show<00:00:15.750> you<00:00:16.619> how

be good now it's trying to show you how
to<00:00:17.010> make<00:00:17.340> lightning

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
to make lightning

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.150 
to make lightning
so<00:00:19.220> make<00:00:20.220> a<00:00:20.250> new<00:00:20.670> project<00:00:21.300> and<00:00:21.859> make<00:00:22.859> a<00:00:22.890> new

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
so make a new project and make a new

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.640 
so make a new project and make a new
sprite<00:00:23.900> first<00:00:24.900> what<00:00:25.080> you<00:00:25.170> want<00:00:25.320> to<00:00:25.410> do<00:00:25.529> is

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
sprite first what you want to do is

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.769 
sprite first what you want to do is
uncheck<00:00:25.949> princess<00:00:26.460> collision<00:00:26.849> checking<00:00:27.090> then

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
uncheck princess collision checking then

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.169 
uncheck princess collision checking then
make<00:00:28.500> it<00:00:28.710> whatever<00:00:29.039> we<00:00:29.220> want<00:00:29.460> it<00:00:29.609> to<00:00:29.640> look<00:00:29.760> like

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
make it whatever we want it to look like

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:34.670 
make it whatever we want it to look like
then<00:00:31.019> make<00:00:31.439> like<00:00:31.800> a<00:00:31.830> ground<00:00:32.279> sprite<00:00:33.500> name<00:00:34.500> it's

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
then make like a ground sprite name it's

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.280 
then make like a ground sprite name it's
bright<00:00:34.890> tile<00:00:35.360> the<00:00:36.360> first<00:00:36.630> one<00:00:36.809> will<00:00:36.989> be<00:00:37.020> name

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
bright tile the first one will be name

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:38.930 
bright tile the first one will be name
is<00:00:37.410> fred<00:00:37.649> wahl<00:00:37.680> uncheck<00:00:38.399> princess<00:00:38.760> Kuragin

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
is fred wahl uncheck princess Kuragin

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.530 
is fred wahl uncheck princess Kuragin
checking<00:00:39.450> with<00:00:39.690> sprite<00:00:40.050> tile<00:00:40.350> and<00:00:40.969> okay<00:00:41.969> now

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
checking with sprite tile and okay now

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.770 
checking with sprite tile and okay now
make<00:00:42.899> a<00:00:43.230> sprite<00:00:43.860> light<00:00:44.190> make<00:00:45.180> it<00:00:45.360> look<00:00:45.539> like<00:00:45.750> a

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
make a sprite light make it look like a

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.590 
make a sprite light make it look like a
torch<00:00:46.170> and<00:00:46.590> archer<00:00:47.520> participation<00:00:48.059> checking

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
torch and archer participation checking

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.690 
torch and archer participation checking
then<00:00:49.289> center<00:00:49.770> the<00:00:49.890> picture<00:00:50.219> because<00:00:50.550> it's

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
then center the picture because it's

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.600 
then center the picture because it's
going<00:00:50.850> to<00:00:50.940> for<00:00:51.180> our<00:00:51.360> mouse<00:00:51.660> and<00:00:52.020> then<00:00:53.010> okay<00:00:53.370> if

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
going to for our mouse and then okay if

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.450 
going to for our mouse and then okay if
you're<00:00:53.789> done<00:00:53.940> with<00:00:54.120> that<00:00:54.149> then<00:00:55.110> go<00:00:55.410> to<00:00:55.469> objects

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
you're done with that then go to objects

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.979 
you're done with that then go to objects
create<00:00:56.850> object<00:00:57.390> and<00:00:57.649> name<00:00:58.649> it<00:00:58.829> global<00:00:59.250> object

00:00:59.979 --> 00:00:59.989 
create object and name it global object

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:09.820 
create object and name it global object
and<00:01:02.239> add<00:01:03.239> event<00:01:03.750> draw<00:01:05.060> now<00:01:07.820> say<00:01:08.820> object<00:01:09.450> equals

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:09.830 
and add event draw now say object equals

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:16.730 
and add event draw now say object equals
instance<00:01:11.689> nearest<00:01:13.700> XY<00:01:14.700> i<00:01:15.030> got<00:01:15.330> damnit<00:01:15.740> XY

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
instance nearest XY i got damnit XY

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.410 
instance nearest XY i got damnit XY
objects<00:01:17.580> whoa<00:01:18.259> no<00:01:19.259> object<00:01:19.890> light<00:01:20.520> so<00:01:21.000> this<00:01:21.270> is

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
objects whoa no object light so this is

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:22.999 
objects whoa no object light so this is
going<00:01:21.600> to<00:01:21.689> look<00:01:21.900> like<00:01:22.049> for<00:01:22.259> the<00:01:22.380> news<00:01:22.530> light

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
going to look like for the news light

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.780 
going to look like for the news light
and<00:01:23.310> it's<00:01:23.430> going<00:01:23.610> to<00:01:23.759> focus<00:01:23.970> on<00:01:24.240> that<00:01:24.420> now<00:01:25.320> if

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:25.790 
and it's going to focus on that now if

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:32.960 
and it's going to focus on that now if
this<00:01:26.790> things<00:01:27.799> to<00:01:28.799> object<00:01:29.990> object<00:01:30.990> is<00:01:31.970> less

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
this things to object object is less

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:37.460 
this things to object object is less
than<00:01:33.350> 160<00:01:34.350> so<00:01:35.280> if<00:01:35.610> it's<00:01:35.790> nearby<00:01:36.090> it's<00:01:37.049> going<00:01:37.320> to

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
than 160 so if it's nearby it's going to

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.950 
than 160 so if it's nearby it's going to
light<00:01:37.650> up<00:01:37.829> and<00:01:38.220> we<00:01:39.119> don't<00:01:39.299> want<00:01:39.450> to<00:01:39.509> light<00:01:39.720> up

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
light up and we don't want to light up

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.730 
light up and we don't want to light up
the<00:01:40.140> blocks<00:01:40.409> that<00:01:40.619> our<00:01:41.070> character<00:01:41.780> let's<00:01:42.780> say

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
the blocks that our character let's say

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.340 
the blocks that our character let's say
it's<00:01:44.460> 2d<00:01:44.880> world<00:01:45.060> so<00:01:45.360> our<00:01:45.450> character<00:01:45.659> cannot

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
it's 2d world so our character cannot

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:51.289 
it's 2d world so our character cannot
really<00:01:46.590> look<00:01:48.290> behind<00:01:49.290> the<00:01:49.590> wall<00:01:49.890> so<00:01:50.430> we<00:01:51.090> also

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
really look behind the wall so we also

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:54.340 
really look behind the wall so we also
cannot<00:01:51.780> see<00:01:51.960> that<00:01:52.079> so<00:01:52.320> let's<00:01:52.560> say<00:01:52.880> collision

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:54.350 
cannot see that so let's say collision

00:01:54.350 --> 00:02:00.560 
cannot see that so let's say collision
line<00:01:56.390> so<00:01:57.390> from<00:01:57.689> our<00:01:57.930> x<00:01:58.710> and<00:01:59.520> the<00:01:59.700> wall<00:01:59.909> X<00:02:00.210> so

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
line so from our x and the wall X so

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.670 
line so from our x and the wall X so
also<00:02:01.560> from<00:02:02.070> the<00:02:02.250> middle<00:02:02.579> so<00:02:02.939> y<00:02:03.240> plus<00:02:03.270> 16<00:02:04.259> X<00:02:04.290> plus

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
also from the middle so y plus 16 X plus

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:05.930 
also from the middle so y plus 16 X plus
16

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:05.940 
16

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:08.000 
16
we're<00:02:06.420> going<00:02:06.660> to<00:02:07.050> have<00:02:07.350> a<00:02:07.380> collision<00:02:07.680> line

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:08.010 
we're going to have a collision line

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:10.340 
we're going to have a collision line
between<00:02:08.190> the<00:02:08.640> wall<00:02:08.910> and<00:02:08.940> the<00:02:09.180> object<00:02:09.720> so

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:10.350 
between the wall and the object so

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:15.980 
between the wall and the object so
object<00:02:10.979> X<00:02:11.330> and<00:02:12.330> object<00:02:13.260> Y<00:02:14.120> now<00:02:15.120> for<00:02:15.780> fear

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:15.990 
object X and object Y now for fear

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:19.300 
object X and object Y now for fear
colliding<00:02:16.500> with<00:02:16.740> will<00:02:17.340> be<00:02:17.520> object<00:02:18.030> wall<00:02:18.360> and

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310 
colliding with will be object wall and

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:24.470 
colliding with will be object wall and
then<00:02:20.310> one<00:02:21.030> for<00:02:21.720> true<00:02:21.990> and<00:02:22.230> 1<00:02:22.530> for<00:02:22.770> true<00:02:22.800> for<00:02:23.480> we

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
then one for true and 1 for true for we

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.030 
then one for true and 1 for true for we
don't<00:02:24.750> want<00:02:24.930> to<00:02:25.020> check<00:02:25.230> if<00:02:25.410> we're<00:02:25.620> colliding

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
don't want to check if we're colliding

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:30.740 
don't want to check if we're colliding
with<00:02:26.250> ourselves<00:02:27.380> so<00:02:28.380> that<00:02:29.120> looks<00:02:30.120> good<00:02:30.420> now

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
with ourselves so that looks good now

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:36.760 
with ourselves so that looks good now
temp<00:02:31.440> temporary<00:02:32.310> alpha<00:02:34.370> equals<00:02:35.370> distance

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:36.770 
temp temporary alpha equals distance

and<00:02:49.400> if<00:02:50.400> we're<00:02:50.880> if<00:02:51.540> it's<00:02:52.050> too<00:02:52.260> far<00:02:52.530> away<00:02:52.590> or

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
and if we're if it's too far away or

and if we're if it's too far away or
it's<00:02:53.970> it's<00:02:54.540> in<00:02:54.900> or<00:02:55.290> between<00:02:55.860> the<00:02:56.040> character

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:56.550 
it's it's in or between the character

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:59.720 
it's it's in or between the character
and<00:02:56.670> the<00:02:56.730> wall<00:02:56.940> is<00:02:57.210> a<00:02:57.240> another<00:02:57.870> wall<00:02:58.460> we<00:02:59.460> want

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
and the wall is a another wall we want

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:04.450 
and the wall is a another wall we want
to<00:02:59.850> have<00:03:00.000> the<00:03:00.450> object<00:03:00.810> black<00:03:01.380> so<00:03:01.800> then<00:03:03.050> alpha

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:04.460 
to have the object black so then alpha

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:08.930 
to have the object black so then alpha
equals<00:03:05.460> 1<00:03:05.960> now<00:03:06.960> let's<00:03:07.620> make<00:03:07.830> another<00:03:07.890> alpha<00:03:08.580> so

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 
equals 1 now let's make another alpha so

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:15.070 
equals 1 now let's make another alpha so
alpha<00:03:08.970> equals<00:03:09.750> alpha<00:03:10.440> 2<00:03:10.800> equals<00:03:11.190> 1<00:03:11.310> and<00:03:12.380> if

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:15.080 
alpha equals alpha 2 equals 1 and if

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:22.340 
then for a alpha is less than alpha 2

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:31.430 
then for a alpha is less than alpha 2
then<00:03:23.340> off<00:03:25.010> till<00:03:26.010> will<00:03:26.340> equal<00:03:26.820> temporary<00:03:27.600> off

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.440 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:35.570 

like<00:03:31.980> that<00:03:32.280> and<00:03:33.150> we<00:03:33.810> wanna<00:03:34.050> looks<00:03:35.040> like<00:03:35.280> it<00:03:35.430> it

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:35.580 
like that and we wanna looks like it it

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:40.580 
like that and we wanna looks like it it
something<00:03:36.000> wrong<00:03:36.240> there<00:03:36.630> Oh<00:03:36.980> too<00:03:37.980> close

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:40.590 
something wrong there Oh too close

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:44.810 
something wrong there Oh too close
oh<00:03:40.620> yeah<00:03:41.310> forget<00:03:42.150> that<00:03:42.600> delete<00:03:43.170> this<00:03:43.820> like

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:44.820 
oh yeah forget that delete this like

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:49.430 
oh yeah forget that delete this like
that<00:03:44.970> and<00:03:45.240> then<00:03:46.080> we<00:03:46.320> wanna<00:03:46.530> roll<00:03:47.100> ourselves<00:03:48.440> so

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:49.440 
that and then we wanna roll ourselves so

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:52.490 
that and then we wanna roll ourselves so
if<00:03:49.710> you<00:03:49.860> have<00:03:49.980> get<00:03:50.760> miracle<00:03:51.090> 8.1<00:03:52.020> you<00:03:52.200> could<00:03:52.380> do

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:52.500 
if you have get miracle 8.1 you could do

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:54.890 
if you have get miracle 8.1 you could do
it<00:03:52.650> yourself<00:03:52.860> and<00:03:53.490> that's<00:03:54.030> going<00:03:54.300> to<00:03:54.390> yourself

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:54.900 
it yourself and that's going to yourself

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:59.600 
it yourself and that's going to yourself
but<00:03:55.110> if<00:03:55.260> you<00:03:55.380> have<00:03:56.000> gaming<00:03:57.000> curve<00:03:58.340> 8.0<00:03:59.340> then

00:03:59.600 --> 00:03:59.610 
but if you have gaming curve 8.0 then

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:05.690 
but if you have gaming curve 8.0 then
you<00:03:59.790> can<00:04:00.030> do<00:04:00.410> draw<00:04:01.410> sprite<00:04:02.690> sprite
