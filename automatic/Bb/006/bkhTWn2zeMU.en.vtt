00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.090
 well this is some news i have already bought in disney's sinnema dictation color there are 

00:00:05.089 --> 00:00:08.089
 five pieces I have you baking I'm going to see what city in 

00:00:09.339 --> 00:00:12.499
 and so a big one I just had all the alderman 

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:14.589
 Goedzo viewers but if they ever 

00:00:14.589 --> 00:00:17.609
 and look what we all have here a puppet we have another 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:20.210
 doll we have another piece here 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:24.310
 at the table there is something else here and we have something fitter and instructions in it 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:29.189
 least instruction and he has to do it all by heart 9 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:31.509
 birthday I'm going to unpack 

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:35.710
 and this is, to begin with, an unknown figure I tried to unpack and 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:36.990
 so 

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:40.160
 this is in fact 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:41.460
 so watch 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:42.750
 pinocchio 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.760
 how to properly keep up with one 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.960
 one niche another one pussy 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:49.970
 he shows this man de facto we see that he is a man 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:55.480
 I have let you see the files of 10 on you but the film set are there for me 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:57.790
 no sense there was once such a 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:00.950
 kenny has an agreement on what you see 

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:05.800
 yes nice well and we have something also it is still in it but you look at that 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:07.020
 still had to 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.950
 I forgot what is this 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:11.950
 a little 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:15.610
 what a little should I think 

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:19.360
 look I did a little bit about it I know he had to get up 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:22.780
 make sure that the fun 7 i'm from in Tokyo 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.470
 and we will look at how this will sit I think this is a platform 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.390
 and there must be something on it I think this piece comes in on that 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:36.960
 the eatc thinking it speaks for itself 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.680
 after he smells through treasures 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:41.770
 where the hell is this ola toivonen at the back 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:43.940
 we look at 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:48.210
 I don't know exactly how this works, as you can see it went together 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:49.580
 look for the training 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:52.640
 too late we look the pass well so look 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:55.370
 I am now really stepping up 

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:58.910
 And this would be against this should you think that something like that is being trivial 

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:00.310
 from film 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:03.100
 come on the map 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:04.610
 juventus yes 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:09.030
 and that works and the car comes so that guy come and have a look 

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:12.349
 this is a good cause at school 

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:15.499
 he comes on the left with his sister-in-law who we put in this piece 

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:22.480
 all that there was reasonable asphalt and my work idea within this lake show it 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:25.379
 know in the comments because then I will just go on one more year like that 

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:29.200
 the corridor collapsed seems to give more than when the middle of it 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:29.729
 screen 

00:02:29.729 --> 00:02:31.540
 have you know that next time 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:32.280
 through the horn
