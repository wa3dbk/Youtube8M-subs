00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:09.870
 Hello and welcome today

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:17.340

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:20.840

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:24.359
 packet for the 350 g peeled tomatoes 

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:26.850

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:30.000

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:32.930

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.930
 pack of mozzarella 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:38.010
 we take our little ones here 

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:40.890
 sliced chicken fillet it and 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:44.329
 roast for about a minute 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.329
 every page briefly 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:51.700
 when that's done we pack the 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:54.879
 here on the plate 

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:58.360
 the whole thing will be integrated now 

00:00:54.879 --> 00:01:02.030
 and now I have a bit of oil here 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:03.460
 and brush here this little form 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:06.110
 therefore a 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:09.860
 I'll put it on a small cut 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:12.580
 tomatoes really nice that we all 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:12.580
 is covered 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:22.210
 then I take here our chicken fillet 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:22.210
 and distributes them here too in the form 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:35.560
 then I take about two tablespoons here 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:37.750
 salt and two tablespoons of pepper spread 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:40.990
 the whole on the chicken then comes 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:44.829
 here our 2 cloves of garlic still added 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:49.439
 and our parsley and chives 

00:01:44.829 --> 00:01:51.399
 and then our peeled tomatoes 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:53.469
 then they go again here the 

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:56.700
 mozzarella cheese and spread it too 

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:56.700
 again beautiful here 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:04.770
 So I have the grill for about 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:08.250
 ten minutes really nice heated 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:11.039
 By giving our form and partner the 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:13.290
 on the grill and then we close that 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:15.319
 whole for 20 minutes and put the 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:17.970
 Grill at the lowest level 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:21.450
 So the whole thing was after 20 minutes 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:26.190
 I have a few things up here 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:27.750
 Ik on leaves here now 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:28.470
 again the leaves and serve the 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.900
 sauce 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:32.760
 There is also a great aroma 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:36.870
 and then we close the lid 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:40.190
 time for 20 minutes after 20 more 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:44.390
 minutes it looks like this 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:47.430
 the cheese is already good to walk 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:49.920
 that is already really delicious me 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:55.170
 would say that's done that's it 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:56.640
 whole on the plate so me 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:58.709
 cut that again here with the 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:00.420
 reproducing for you here 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:03.550
 by that a bit so you can see 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:10.330
 that has become really soft so 

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:12.970
 really worth it to do yes 

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:16.050
 I only say good appetite and a lot 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:16.050
