but as you see that I have all other
colors<00:01:35.680> because<00:01:35.860> so<00:01:36.520> it<00:01:36.700> that<00:01:36.880> depends<00:01:37.240> on<00:01:37.330> you

00:01:37.469 --> 00:01:37.479 
colors because so it that depends on you

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:38.639 
colors because so it that depends on you
that<00:01:37.659> which<00:01:37.810> kind<00:01:38.020> of<00:01:38.110> color<00:01:38.259> you<00:01:38.409> want<00:01:38.590> to

00:01:38.639 --> 00:01:38.649

that which kind of color you want to
give<00:01:38.830> to<00:01:38.979> your<00:01:39.070> bottle<00:01:39.340> I<00:01:39.460> am<00:01:39.580> just<00:01:40.000> using<00:01:40.180> pink

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:40.600 
give to your bottle I am just using pink

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:44.730 
give to your bottle I am just using pink
and<00:01:40.840> the<00:01:41.409> brown<00:01:42.070> color<00:01:42.460> or<00:01:42.759> coffee<00:01:43.360> color<00:01:43.740> wool

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:44.740 
and the brown color or coffee color wool

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:46.950 
and the brown color or coffee color wool
so<00:01:45.369> it<00:01:45.460> depends<00:01:46.149> on<00:01:46.240> you<00:01:46.390> which<00:01:46.539> kind<00:01:46.690> of<00:01:46.840> color

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:46.960 
so it depends on you which kind of color

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:48.749 
so it depends on you which kind of color
you<00:01:47.020> want<00:01:47.350> to<00:01:47.470> give<00:01:47.619> to<00:01:47.770> your<00:01:47.860> bottle<00:01:48.190> so<00:01:48.640> it's

00:01:48.749 --> 00:01:48.759 
you want to give to your bottle so it's

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:52.320 
you want to give to your bottle so it's
easy<00:01:49.090> way<00:01:49.539> to<00:01:49.600> do<00:01:49.929> this<00:01:49.960> is<00:01:50.590> just<00:01:51.149> keep<00:01:52.149> it

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:52.330 
easy way to do this is just keep it

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:54.690 
easy way to do this is just keep it
standing<00:01:52.600> and<00:01:53.020> then<00:01:53.350> move<00:01:53.619> the<00:01:54.190> bottle<00:01:54.520> with

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:54.700 
standing and then move the bottle with

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:56.999 
standing and then move the bottle with
one<00:01:54.940> hand<00:01:55.240> and<00:01:55.390> the<00:01:56.020> bowl<00:01:56.229> with<00:01:56.470> the<00:01:56.500> other<00:01:56.740> one

00:01:56.999 --> 00:01:57.009 
one hand and the bowl with the other one

00:01:57.009 --> 00:01:59.160 
one hand and the bowl with the other one
otherwise<00:01:57.670> it<00:01:57.850> will<00:01:57.940> take<00:01:58.149> a<00:01:58.300> lot<00:01:58.539> of<00:01:58.690> time<00:01:58.929> to

00:01:59.160 --> 00:01:59.170 
otherwise it will take a lot of time to

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:01.380 
otherwise it will take a lot of time to
just<00:01:59.380> cover<00:01:59.590> the<00:01:59.830> whole<00:01:59.979> bottle<00:02:00.369> with<00:02:00.940> this

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:01.390 
just cover the whole bottle with this

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:13.059 
just cover the whole bottle with this
kind<00:02:01.750> of<00:02:01.810> method<00:02:02.110> that<00:02:02.140> I'm<00:02:02.380> using<00:02:02.590> right<00:02:02.920> now

00:02:13.059 --> 00:02:13.069 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:17.330 

if<00:02:14.069> you<00:02:14.219> don't<00:02:14.489> like<00:02:14.840> the<00:02:15.840> thread<00:02:16.290> very<00:02:16.980> far

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
if you don't like the thread very far

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.490 
if you don't like the thread very far
from<00:02:17.670> each<00:02:17.760> other<00:02:18.120> and<00:02:18.540> you<00:02:18.599> want<00:02:18.930> to<00:02:19.049> give<00:02:19.349> it

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
from each other and you want to give it

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.559 
from each other and you want to give it
a<00:02:19.620> tight<00:02:19.890> loop<00:02:20.219> then<00:02:20.459> you<00:02:20.579> can<00:02:20.760> just<00:02:20.939> push<00:02:21.180> the

00:02:21.559 --> 00:02:21.569 
a tight loop then you can just push the

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:24.559 
a tight loop then you can just push the
bull<00:02:22.200> or<00:02:22.530> the<00:02:22.799> thread<00:02:23.099> over<00:02:23.640> so<00:02:24.120> that<00:02:24.150> it<00:02:24.420> can

00:02:24.559 --> 00:02:24.569 
bull or the thread over so that it can

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:26.780 
bull or the thread over so that it can
fit<00:02:24.780> together<00:02:25.290> otherwise<00:02:25.739> later<00:02:26.189> you<00:02:26.489> can't

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
fit together otherwise later you can't

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:43.009 
fit together otherwise later you can't
do<00:02:26.970> that<00:02:27.150> so<00:02:27.629> just<00:02:27.900> keep<00:02:28.230> doing<00:02:28.590> that<00:02:28.620> I<00:02:42.019> found

00:02:43.009 --> 00:02:43.019 
do that so just keep doing that I found

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:45.319 
do that so just keep doing that I found
this<00:02:43.349> method<00:02:43.650> to<00:02:43.980> be<00:02:44.010> the<00:02:44.250> easiest<00:02:44.730> one<00:02:45.120> to

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:45.329 
this method to be the easiest one to

00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:47.629 
this method to be the easiest one to
just<00:02:45.689> roll<00:02:46.200> the<00:02:46.500> whole<00:02:46.739> thread<00:02:47.129> over<00:02:47.489> the

00:02:47.629 --> 00:02:47.639 
just roll the whole thread over the

00:02:47.639 --> 00:02:49.640 
just roll the whole thread over the
water<00:02:48.060> otherwise<00:02:48.359> it<00:02:48.599> was<00:02:49.049> taking<00:02:49.319> a<00:02:49.409> lot<00:02:49.530> of

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
water otherwise it was taking a lot of

00:02:49.650 --> 00:05:14.660 
water otherwise it was taking a lot of
time<00:02:49.889> for<00:02:50.099> me<00:02:50.310> to<00:02:50.519> just<00:02:50.730> keep<00:02:51.329> it<00:02:51.510> doing<00:02:51.750> that

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:14.670 

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:46.670
