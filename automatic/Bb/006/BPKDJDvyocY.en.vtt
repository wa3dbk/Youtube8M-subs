it migrates into dormant buds and so

we<00:00:55.760> can<00:00:55.940> also<00:00:56.090> apply<00:00:56.899> coppers<00:00:58.180> as<00:00:59.180> dormant

00:00:59.680 --> 00:00:59.690

and bacterial canker is a problem that

limits the effectiveness of coppers and

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:45.339 
limits the effectiveness of coppers and
also<00:01:42.670> as<00:01:43.670> we<00:01:43.849> use<00:01:44.030> coppers<00:01:44.569> they<00:01:45.020> can<00:01:45.229> be

also as we use coppers they can be

also as we use coppers they can be

North West Michigan horticultural
Research<00:01:58.160> Station<00:01:58.729> we<00:01:59.390> found<00:01:59.660> that<00:01:59.899> copper

00:02:00.279 --> 00:02:00.289 
Research Station we found that copper

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:02.589 
Research Station we found that copper
sprays<00:02:00.590> would<00:02:00.920> reduce<00:02:01.610> Pseudomonas<00:02:02.509> syringae

00:02:02.589 --> 00:02:02.599 
sprays would reduce Pseudomonas syringae

00:02:02.599 --> 00:02:04.900 
sprays would reduce Pseudomonas syringae
populations<00:02:03.470> but<00:02:03.679> they<00:02:03.860> very<00:02:04.129> quickly<00:02:04.310> within

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:04.910 
populations but they very quickly within

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:07.540 
populations but they very quickly within
two<00:02:05.330> days<00:02:05.539> they<00:02:06.319> rebounded<00:02:06.860> the<00:02:06.920> levels<00:02:07.369> where

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:07.550 
two days they rebounded the levels where

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:09.609 
two days they rebounded the levels where
as<00:02:07.819> if<00:02:08.209> we<00:02:08.239> had<00:02:08.479> not<00:02:08.599> sprayed<00:02:08.929> copper<00:02:09.319> at<00:02:09.440> all

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:09.619 
as if we had not sprayed copper at all

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:13.630 
as if we had not sprayed copper at all
so<00:02:10.420> it's<00:02:11.420> very<00:02:11.690> difficult<00:02:12.440> for<00:02:12.890> us<00:02:12.950> to<00:02:13.220> control

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640 
so it's very difficult for us to control

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:17.530 
so it's very difficult for us to control
this<00:02:13.879> organism<00:02:14.540> because<00:02:15.410> not<00:02:15.920> only<00:02:15.950> you<00:02:16.610> don't

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540 
this organism because not only you don't

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:19.300 
this organism because not only you don't
have<00:02:17.750> materials<00:02:18.319> that<00:02:18.379> can<00:02:18.590> target<00:02:18.859> it<00:02:19.069> when

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310 
have materials that can target it when
