00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:07.380
Hi! I am here to present you

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.000
the latest model of the Acer Company

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:12.050
which appeared to be a very nice surprise for us

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:14.540
This is the Acer Aspire 5738

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:19.050
and it continues the successful Gemestone Blue series

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:23.430
Lately, the Taiwan producer has a serious progress

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:26.450
and 5738 is the exact proof for that

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:30.050
May be this computer will be the leap forward

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:31.930
which is going to send Acer

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:34.390
into the list of the best laptop producers.

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:36.340
Why do we think so?

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:38.520
In creating the main body of the laptop

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:40.060
is used better plastic

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:42.610
which prevents the presence of windages

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:45.130
which we were able to find

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.040
in company's older products.

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:49.560
The keyboard is also totally renewed

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:53.620
and the keys have bigger size which means

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:56.040
more comfort for its users.

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:00.180
In addition, there is a numeric keyboard added,

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.450
which is something that you can't very often see in a laptop keyboard.

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:06.290
What kind of extra features has the new 5738?

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:08.380
Besides the fingerprint reader,

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.990
on the left side of the laptop body,

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:14.040
we can consecutively find an AC adapter jack,

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:18.820
LAN Card port, HDMI port for audio and video transmitting to multimedia devices,

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:23.100
VGA port, 2xUSB ports and jacks for microphone and stereo headphones.

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.020
On the right side there are two more USB ports,

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:30.560
a Blueray Drive, which burns CDs and DVDs,

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:33.660
a modem jack and a Kensington lock slot.

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.810
The display is ideal for people who like waching movies

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:41.120
because of the aspect ratio of 16:9

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:46.000
and the resolution of 1366 by 768 pixels.

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:54.250
This particular model is powered by an Intel Core 2 Duo T6400 processor.

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:58.140
It has 4GB of RAM and 500GB of a hard drive.

00:01:58.250 --> 00:01:59.290
But the most interesting part

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:01.670
is the presence of a 3G module.

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:03.600
This computer is a great choice for home users

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:08.170
who are looking for a stable and highly functional machine.

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:10.080
