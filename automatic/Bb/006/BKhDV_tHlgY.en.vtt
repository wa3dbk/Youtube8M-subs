glass<00:00:29.279> I<00:00:29.550> don't<00:00:30.029> really<00:00:30.240> think<00:00:30.539> there's<00:00:30.750> one

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
glass I don't really think there's one

glass I don't really think there's one
so<00:00:31.260> this<00:00:32.160> is<00:00:32.189> definitely<00:00:32.520> one<00:00:33.000> of<00:00:33.059> my<00:00:33.149> best

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390

game plates that I've ever gotten this
is<00:00:35.340> just<00:00:35.940> absolutely<00:00:36.180> amazing<00:00:36.469> and<00:00:37.469> the<00:00:37.649> funny

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
is just absolutely amazing and the funny

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.160 
is just absolutely amazing and the funny
thing<00:00:37.980> is<00:00:38.219> when<00:00:39.000> I<00:00:39.059> was<00:00:39.210> playing<00:00:39.360> this<00:00:39.660> I<00:00:39.899> was

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
thing is when I was playing this I was

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.830 
thing is when I was playing this I was
not<00:00:40.500> even<00:00:40.710> like<00:00:41.129> trying<00:00:41.579> that<00:00:41.910> hard<00:00:42.329> but<00:00:42.600> I

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
not even like trying that hard but I

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.660 
not even like trying that hard but I
started<00:00:43.410> trying<00:00:43.559> hard<00:00:43.829> after<00:00:44.010> the<00:00:44.219> second<00:00:44.550> mob

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
started trying hard after the second mob

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.150 
started trying hard after the second mob
and<00:00:44.910> the<00:00:45.750> way<00:00:46.020> that<00:00:46.200> they<00:00:46.500> actually<00:00:46.649> end<00:00:47.010> up

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
and the way that they actually end up

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.029 
and the way that they actually end up
playing<00:00:47.489> this<00:00:48.140> way<00:00:49.140> ended<00:00:49.620> up<00:00:49.710> playing<00:00:49.890> this

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
playing this way ended up playing this

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:53.959 
playing this way ended up playing this
um<00:00:50.340> basically<00:00:51.140> my<00:00:52.140> friend<00:00:52.500> predator<00:00:53.190> and<00:00:53.520> I

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
um basically my friend predator and I

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.330 
um basically my friend predator and I
were<00:00:54.390> playing<00:00:54.690> a<00:00:54.809> lot<00:00:55.020> of<00:00:55.140> call<00:00:55.379> duty<00:00:55.590> and<00:00:55.890> then

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
were playing a lot of call duty and then

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.729 
were playing a lot of call duty and then
we<00:00:56.579> were<00:00:56.760> basically<00:00:57.180> done<00:00:57.629> playing<00:00:57.960> and<00:00:58.289> I

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
we were basically done playing and I

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.260 
we were basically done playing and I
told<00:00:58.920> him<00:00:59.039> to<00:00:59.190> go<00:00:59.280> look<00:00:59.489> for<00:00:59.640> a<00:00:59.670> daisy<00:00:59.879> server

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
told him to go look for a daisy server

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:01.790 
told him to go look for a daisy server
so<00:01:00.510> we<00:01:00.600> can<00:01:00.719> switch<00:01:01.050> to<00:01:01.079> another<00:01:01.289> game<00:01:01.590> and

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
so we can switch to another game and

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.189 
so we can switch to another game and
meanwhile<00:01:02.760> one<00:01:03.270> while<00:01:03.570> he<00:01:03.690> was<00:01:03.780> looking<00:01:04.049> for<00:01:04.170> a

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
meanwhile one while he was looking for a

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.920 
meanwhile one while he was looking for a
server<00:01:04.439> I<00:01:04.739> stayed<00:01:05.309> up<00:01:05.489> I<00:01:05.850> say<00:01:06.180> for<00:01:06.390> I<00:01:06.479> think<00:01:06.540> one

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
server I stayed up I say for I think one

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.109 
server I stayed up I say for I think one
more<00:01:07.080> game<00:01:07.350> and<00:01:07.380> I<00:01:08.100> don't<00:01:08.369> probably<00:01:08.549> rage<00:01:08.909> with

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
more game and I don't probably rage with

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.330 
more game and I don't probably rage with
this<00:01:09.240> game<00:01:09.390> anyways<00:01:09.750> because<00:01:10.220> there's<00:01:11.220> only

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
this game anyways because there's only

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.070 
this game anyways because there's only
four<00:01:11.670> guys<00:01:11.850> at<00:01:12.060> the<00:01:12.119> beginning<00:01:12.510> like<00:01:12.750> it<00:01:12.930> was

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
four guys at the beginning like it was

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.100 
four guys at the beginning like it was
really<00:01:13.320> bad<00:01:13.470> so<00:01:13.770> I<00:01:14.520> just<00:01:15.479> stayed<00:01:15.780> for<00:01:16.080> like

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
really bad so I just stayed for like

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.740 
really bad so I just stayed for like
playing<00:01:16.710> like<00:01:16.890> randomly<00:01:17.280> and<00:01:17.520> somehow<00:01:18.240> I

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
playing like randomly and somehow I

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.120 
playing like randomly and somehow I
didn't<00:01:19.020> even<00:01:19.080> know<00:01:19.259> how<00:01:19.439> I<00:01:19.650> managed<00:01:19.860> to<00:01:19.950> pull

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
didn't even know how I managed to pull

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.880 
didn't even know how I managed to pull
off<00:01:20.189> to<00:01:20.520> mobs<00:01:20.820> at<00:01:21.299> the<00:01:21.390> beginning<00:01:21.810> and<00:01:22.049> I<00:01:22.439> Scott

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
off to mobs at the beginning and I Scott

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.890 
off to mobs at the beginning and I Scott
I<00:01:23.070> wanted<00:01:23.700> to<00:01:23.790> stay<00:01:24.000> on<00:01:24.119> a<00:01:24.180> streak<00:01:24.570> because<00:01:24.869> I

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
I wanted to stay on a streak because I

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.899 
I wanted to stay on a streak because I
had<00:01:25.170> still<00:01:25.350> had<00:01:25.500> a<00:01:25.530> lot<00:01:25.680> of<00:01:25.740> time<00:01:26.009> so<00:01:26.580> I<00:01:26.610> decided

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
had still had a lot of time so I decided

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:28.940

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
why not try to get up this quad mob that

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.950 
why not try to get up this quad mob that
I've<00:01:29.070> never<00:01:29.280> got<00:01:29.520> and<00:01:29.880> if<00:01:30.270> you<00:01:30.659> guys<00:01:30.780> don't

upload speed is terrible so it might

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:52.390

so<00:03:08.180> I<00:03:08.480> think<00:03:08.989> that's<00:03:09.169> the<00:03:09.439> best<00:03:09.530> way<00:03:09.739> to<00:03:09.799> make

00:03:10.149 --> 00:03:10.159 
so I think that's the best way to make

00:03:10.159 --> 00:03:13.000 
so I think that's the best way to make
it<00:03:10.340> and<00:03:10.669> this<00:03:11.209> the<00:03:11.480> server<00:03:11.720> had<00:03:12.049> custom<00:03:12.829> rule

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:13.010 
it and this the server had custom rule

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:15.520 
it and this the server had custom rule
so<00:03:13.250> this<00:03:13.909> was<00:03:14.030> played<00:03:14.209> on<00:03:14.239> photo<00:03:14.540> 21<00:03:14.720> and<00:03:15.109> this

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:15.530 
so this was played on photo 21 and this

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:17.800 
so this was played on photo 21 and this
ever<00:03:15.709> had<00:03:16.010> rules<00:03:16.909> basically<00:03:17.239> it's<00:03:17.629> team

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:17.810 
ever had rules basically it's team

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:20.409 
ever had rules basically it's team
deathmatch<00:03:18.199> there's<00:03:19.040> no<00:03:19.220> actual<00:03:19.519> score<00:03:20.120> limit

00:03:20.409 --> 00:03:20.419 
deathmatch there's no actual score limit

00:03:20.419 --> 00:03:22.270 
deathmatch there's no actual score limit
but<00:03:20.659> as<00:03:20.810> there's<00:03:21.139> a<00:03:21.229> 20-minute<00:03:21.769> time<00:03:21.949> limit<00:03:21.979> so

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:22.280 
but as there's a 20-minute time limit so

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:25.390 
but as there's a 20-minute time limit so
um<00:03:22.760> at<00:03:23.449> the<00:03:23.510> beginning<00:03:23.989> and<00:03:24.199> also<00:03:24.470> it's<00:03:24.590> 99<00:03:25.099> so

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:25.400 
um at the beginning and also it's 99 so

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:27.759 
um at the beginning and also it's 99 so
at<00:03:25.819> the<00:03:25.940> beginning<00:03:26.030> the<00:03:26.510> for<00:03:27.169> the<00:03:27.260> first<00:03:27.530> model

00:03:27.759 --> 00:03:27.769 
at the beginning the for the first model

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:29.589 
at the beginning the for the first model
basically<00:03:28.069> there<00:03:28.430> was<00:03:28.489> only<00:03:28.669> four<00:03:29.000> players<00:03:29.209> in

00:03:29.589 --> 00:03:29.599 
basically there was only four players in

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:32.259 
basically there was only four players in
the<00:03:30.260> enemy<00:03:30.500> team<00:03:30.650> only<00:03:30.889> four<00:03:31.159> guys<00:03:31.340> and<00:03:31.609> that's

00:03:32.259 --> 00:03:32.269 
the enemy team only four guys and that's

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:35.770 
the enemy team only four guys and that's
why<00:03:32.479> I<00:03:32.540> didn't<00:03:32.810> really<00:03:32.959> had<00:03:33.769> any<00:03:33.979> high<00:03:34.629> and<00:03:35.629> he

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:35.780 
why I didn't really had any high and he

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:37.569 
why I didn't really had any high and he
expect<00:03:36.079> anything<00:03:36.290> like<00:03:36.709> special<00:03:37.280> about<00:03:37.459> this

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:37.579 
expect anything like special about this

00:03:37.579 --> 00:03:39.939 
expect anything like special about this
gameplay<00:03:37.790> just<00:03:38.090> take<00:03:39.019> the<00:03:39.109> play<00:03:39.319> and<00:03:39.620> wait<00:03:39.799> for

00:03:39.939 --> 00:03:39.949 
gameplay just take the play and wait for

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:42.009 
gameplay just take the play and wait for
my<00:03:40.010> friend<00:03:40.220> upon<00:03:40.400> the<00:03:40.489> server<00:03:40.699> and<00:03:40.940> I'm<00:03:41.659> later

00:03:42.009 --> 00:03:42.019 
my friend upon the server and I'm later

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:43.780 
my friend upon the server and I'm later
on<00:03:42.229> I<00:03:42.440> think<00:03:42.680> after<00:03:42.829> the<00:03:43.040> second<00:03:43.400> walk<00:03:43.519> like

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:43.790 
on I think after the second walk like

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:45.939 
on I think after the second walk like
for<00:03:44.120> the<00:03:44.209> first<00:03:44.449> two<00:03:44.690> moves<00:03:44.930> there<00:03:45.530> was<00:03:45.650> four

00:03:45.939 --> 00:03:45.949 
for the first two moves there was four

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:47.890 
for the first two moves there was four
to<00:03:46.310> six<00:03:46.579> people<00:03:46.729> in<00:03:46.970> the<00:03:47.030> server<00:03:47.209> and<00:03:47.449> after

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:47.900 
to six people in the server and after

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:50.110 
to six people in the server and after
the<00:03:47.989> second<00:03:48.290> lab<00:03:48.470> more<00:03:49.190> people<00:03:49.489> joined<00:03:49.729> in<00:03:49.879> and

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:50.120 
the second lab more people joined in and

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:51.610 
the second lab more people joined in and
by<00:03:50.449> the<00:03:50.510> end<00:03:50.659> I<00:03:50.750> think<00:03:50.780> there<00:03:51.139> was<00:03:51.229> like<00:03:51.440> nine

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:51.620 
by the end I think there was like nine

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:52.990 
by the end I think there was like nine
people<00:03:52.010> or<00:03:52.099> seven<00:03:52.459> or<00:03:52.579> something<00:03:52.849> there's

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:53.000 
people or seven or something there's

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.140 
people or seven or something there's
quite<00:03:53.720> a<00:03:53.750> lot<00:03:53.870> of<00:03:53.989> people<00:03:54.109> so<00:03:54.470> um<00:03:54.909> you<00:03:55.909> can't

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:56.150 
quite a lot of people so um you can't

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:58.119 
quite a lot of people so um you can't
act<00:03:56.389> and<00:03:56.599> some<00:03:56.750> people<00:03:56.989> might<00:03:57.109> think<00:03:57.349> that<00:03:57.799> it

00:03:58.119 --> 00:03:58.129 
act and some people might think that it

00:03:58.129 --> 00:03:59.949 
act and some people might think that it
is<00:03:58.159> easy<00:03:58.549> because<00:03:58.790> you<00:03:59.030> had<00:03:59.150> 20<00:03:59.449> minutes<00:03:59.750> it's

00:03:59.949 --> 00:03:59.959 
is easy because you had 20 minutes it's

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:02.199 
is easy because you had 20 minutes it's
something<00:04:00.229> so<00:04:00.409> first<00:04:01.220> of<00:04:01.370> all<00:04:01.430> most<00:04:01.970> of<00:04:02.120> the

00:04:02.199 --> 00:04:02.209 
something so first of all most of the

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:05.140 
something so first of all most of the
domination<00:04:02.569> games<00:04:02.930> are<00:04:03.709> about<00:04:03.829> I<00:04:04.489> would<00:04:05.030> say

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:05.150 
domination games are about I would say

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:07.960 
domination games are about I would say
10<00:04:05.720> to<00:04:05.959> 15<00:04:06.319> minutes<00:04:06.530> so<00:04:07.159> if<00:04:07.340> you<00:04:07.430> add<00:04:07.549> an<00:04:07.729> extra

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:07.970 
10 to 15 minutes so if you add an extra

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:10.030 
10 to 15 minutes so if you add an extra
five<00:04:08.239> minutes<00:04:08.269> with<00:04:08.840> four<00:04:09.079> guys<00:04:09.259> it's<00:04:09.889> not

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:10.040 
five minutes with four guys it's not

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:11.979 
five minutes with four guys it's not
really<00:04:10.250> a<00:04:10.280> huge<00:04:10.759> difference<00:04:11.030> and<00:04:11.449> considering

00:04:11.979 --> 00:04:11.989 
really a huge difference and considering

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:14.020 
really a huge difference and considering
that<00:04:12.109> i'm<00:04:12.199> playing<00:04:12.319> solo<00:04:12.709> I<00:04:13.040> didn't<00:04:14.000> think

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:14.030 
that i'm playing solo I didn't think

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:15.520 
that i'm playing solo I didn't think
there's<00:04:14.329> a<00:04:14.419> huge<00:04:14.629> difference<00:04:14.810> at<00:04:15.109> all<00:04:15.139> so<00:04:15.500> I

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:15.530 
there's a huge difference at all so I

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:17.770 
there's a huge difference at all so I
think<00:04:15.889> this<00:04:15.979> is<00:04:16.039> a<00:04:16.190> really<00:04:16.370> good<00:04:16.579> gameplay<00:04:16.909> if

00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:17.780 
think this is a really good gameplay if

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:19.749 
think this is a really good gameplay if
you<00:04:17.959> I<00:04:18.199> don't<00:04:18.650> know<00:04:18.709> you<00:04:19.250> probably<00:04:19.459> know<00:04:19.639> my

00:04:19.749 --> 00:04:19.759 
you I don't know you probably know my

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:21.279 
you I don't know you probably know my
standards<00:04:20.209> by<00:04:20.450> looking<00:04:20.690> at<00:04:20.719> my<00:04:20.870> other<00:04:21.019> game

00:04:21.279 --> 00:04:21.289 
standards by looking at my other game

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:23.409 
standards by looking at my other game
place<00:04:21.500> so<00:04:22.039> you<00:04:22.099> will<00:04:22.370> see<00:04:22.400> that<00:04:22.700> if<00:04:23.090> you<00:04:23.270> eat

00:04:23.409 --> 00:04:23.419 
place so you will see that if you eat

00:04:23.419 --> 00:04:24.520 
place so you will see that if you eat
this<00:04:23.570> was

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:24.530 
this was

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:26.350 
this was
to<00:04:24.680> get<00:04:24.830> i<00:04:25.010> would<00:04:25.190> probably<00:04:25.730> get<00:04:25.820> it<00:04:25.970> a<00:04:26.120> lot<00:04:26.210> of

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:26.360 
to get i would probably get it a lot of

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:28.360 
to get i would probably get it a lot of
a<00:04:26.450> lot<00:04:26.570> more<00:04:26.600> times<00:04:27.050> and<00:04:27.320> you'll<00:04:28.010> see<00:04:28.160> that<00:04:28.280> i'm

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:28.370 
a lot more times and you'll see that i'm

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:30.160 
a lot more times and you'll see that i'm
actually<00:04:28.520> really<00:04:29.000> good<00:04:29.240> and<00:04:29.480> I'm<00:04:29.630> really

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:30.170 
actually really good and I'm really

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:31.960 
actually really good and I'm really
really<00:04:30.380> like<00:04:30.980> I<00:04:31.130> really<00:04:31.370> struggle<00:04:31.760> to<00:04:31.790> get

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:31.970 
really like I really struggle to get

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:34.420 
really like I really struggle to get
this<00:04:32.090> gameplay<00:04:32.330> and<00:04:32.690> um<00:04:32.900> auntie<00:04:33.889> Maude's<00:04:34.220> that

this gameplay and um auntie Maude's that

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:36.310 
this gameplay and um auntie Maude's that
God<00:04:34.669> are<00:04:35.210> not<00:04:35.419> really<00:04:35.630> that<00:04:35.780> fast<00:04:36.020> like

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:36.320 
God are not really that fast like

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:38.320 
God are not really that fast like
they're<00:04:36.560> just<00:04:36.800> really<00:04:37.100> consistent<00:04:37.730> I<00:04:37.910> did<00:04:38.240> he

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:38.330 
they're just really consistent I did he

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:40.060 
they're just really consistent I did he
had<00:04:38.450> no<00:04:38.630> mistakes<00:04:39.050> in<00:04:39.200> this<00:04:39.260> game<00:04:39.440> I<00:04:39.470> had<00:04:39.889> like

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:40.070 
had no mistakes in this game I had like

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:42.520

died as well on specialist but that's

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:50.200

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:54.310 
game was flawless like I didn't had any
mistakes<00:04:52.520> that's<00:04:53.210> what<00:04:53.450> made<00:04:53.630> it<00:04:53.660> so<00:04:53.930> good<00:04:54.080> on

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:54.320 
mistakes that's what made it so good on

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:56.650 
mistakes that's what made it so good on
actual<00:04:54.919> moms<00:04:55.160> are<00:04:55.280> not<00:04:55.400> with<00:04:55.580> that<00:04:55.610> fast<00:04:55.970> first

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:56.660 
actual moms are not with that fast first

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:58.720 
actual moms are not with that fast first
three<00:04:57.140> of<00:04:57.230> them<00:04:57.380> I<00:04:57.500> think<00:04:57.740> first<00:04:58.250> two<00:04:58.460> of<00:04:58.550> them

00:04:58.720 --> 00:04:58.730 
three of them I think first two of them

00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:01.690 
three of them I think first two of them
are<00:04:58.940> slow<00:04:59.720> and<00:04:59.960> then<00:05:00.470> because<00:05:01.040> I<00:05:01.280> was<00:05:01.490> playing

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:01.700 
are slow and then because I was playing

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:03.850 
are slow and then because I was playing
for<00:05:01.880> guys<00:05:02.150> and<00:05:02.390> then<00:05:02.660> after<00:05:03.200> that<00:05:03.230> I<00:05:03.560> think

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:03.860 
for guys and then after that I think

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:05.350 
for guys and then after that I think
they're<00:05:04.100> all<00:05:04.250> like<00:05:04.520> two<00:05:04.760> minutes<00:05:04.940> two<00:05:05.210> and<00:05:05.330> a

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:05.360 
they're all like two minutes two and a

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:07.570 
they're all like two minutes two and a
half<00:05:05.390> minutes<00:05:05.600> or<00:05:05.840> something<00:05:05.930> so<00:05:06.290> I<00:05:06.890> managed

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:07.580 
half minutes or something so I managed

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:09.070 
half minutes or something so I managed
to<00:05:07.610> speed<00:05:07.880> it<00:05:07.970> up<00:05:08.030> a<00:05:08.150> little<00:05:08.270> bit<00:05:08.390> and<00:05:08.660> fifth

to speed it up a little bit and fifth

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:12.940
