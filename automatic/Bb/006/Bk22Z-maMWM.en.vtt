to kismet

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:21.259 
to kismet
an<00:02:18.599> important<00:02:19.290> element<00:02:19.439> to<00:02:19.920> any<00:02:20.549> prototype<00:02:20.969> is

00:02:21.259 --> 00:02:21.269 
an important element to any prototype is

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:23.270 
an important element to any prototype is
communication<00:02:21.989> and<00:02:22.230> one<00:02:22.769> of<00:02:22.890> the<00:02:22.950> best<00:02:23.129> ways

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
communication and one of the best ways

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:24.500 
communication and one of the best ways
you<00:02:23.430> can<00:02:23.579> do<00:02:23.640> that<00:02:23.760> is<00:02:23.939> on-screen<00:02:24.239> information

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
you can do that is on-screen information

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:27.110 
you can do that is on-screen information
so<00:02:25.319> we<00:02:25.439> go<00:02:25.590> over<00:02:25.769> using<00:02:25.920> the<00:02:26.129> drawing<00:02:26.430> text

so we go over using the drawing text

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.349 
so we go over using the drawing text
