site like this I can maintain this file

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:38.520 
site like this I can maintain this file
myself<00:01:36.520> and<00:01:36.850> Google<00:01:37.240> will<00:01:37.270> actually<00:01:37.840> go<00:01:38.350> out

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:38.530 
myself and Google will actually go out

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:40.830 
myself and Google will actually go out
and<00:01:38.560> upload<00:01:39.190> upload<00:01:39.700> it<00:01:39.970> once<00:01:40.149> a<00:01:40.270> week<00:01:40.300> or<00:01:40.750> I

to their site once a week and then they

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:51.359 
to their site once a week and then they
can<00:01:48.429> they<00:01:48.640> can<00:01:48.670> actually<00:01:48.970> scan<00:01:49.810> my<00:01:50.020> pages<00:01:50.590> so

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:01.960 
pages are more important to me because I

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:06.029 
pages are more important to me because I
put<00:02:02.110> a<00:02:02.140> priority<00:02:02.440> in<00:02:02.770> there<00:02:02.979> and<00:02:04.979> you<00:02:05.979> know

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:07.689 
there's no guesswork as far as if I got

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:10.160 
there's no guesswork as far as if I got
broken<00:02:08.019> links<00:02:08.320> or<00:02:08.440> anything<00:02:08.709> like<00:02:08.739> that<00:02:09.119> so
