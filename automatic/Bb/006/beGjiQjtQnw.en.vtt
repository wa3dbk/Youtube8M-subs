make sure console is enabled if it isn't

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.640 
make sure console is enabled if it isn't
make<00:00:28.859> sure<00:00:29.070> it<00:00:29.279> is<00:00:29.970> then<00:00:30.750> you<00:00:31.019> got<00:00:31.170> a<00:00:31.199> click<00:00:31.439> the

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
make sure it is then you got a click the

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.770 
make sure it is then you got a click the
button<00:00:31.980> to<00:00:32.130> the<00:00:32.309> left<00:00:32.460> of<00:00:32.790> the<00:00:32.969> one<00:00:33.180> point

apostrophe you click that button the

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.490 
apostrophe you click that button the
