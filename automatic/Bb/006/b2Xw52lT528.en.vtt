00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
are the rumors normally these rumors are

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.080 
are the rumors normally these rumors are
they<00:00:28.560> normally<00:00:28.890> end<00:00:29.010> up<00:00:29.130> being<00:00:29.340> true<00:00:29.670> I<00:00:29.699> can't

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
they normally end up being true I can't

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:31.550 
they normally end up being true I can't
verify<00:00:30.359> these<00:00:30.630> one<00:00:30.900> hundred<00:00:30.929> percent<00:00:31.170> they

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
verify these one hundred percent they

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.740 
verify these one hundred percent they
are<00:00:31.710> not<00:00:31.920> official<00:00:32.460> but<00:00:32.640> it's<00:00:33.210> very<00:00:33.360> rare<00:00:33.690> that

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
are not official but it's very rare that

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.600 
are not official but it's very rare that
these<00:00:34.230> things<00:00:34.500> like<00:00:34.680> this<00:00:34.829> come<00:00:35.070> out<00:00:35.219> and<00:00:35.460> that

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
these things like this come out and that

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.400 
these things like this come out and that
there's<00:00:35.850> no<00:00:36.120> substance<00:00:36.719> to<00:00:36.840> them<00:00:37.050> whatsoever

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
there's no substance to them whatsoever

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.680 
there's no substance to them whatsoever
so<00:00:37.829> you<00:00:37.920> could<00:00:38.040> probably<00:00:38.329> you<00:00:39.329> could<00:00:39.450> probably

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
so you could probably you could probably

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.330 
so you could probably you could probably
presume<00:00:40.290> that<00:00:40.320> it's<00:00:40.559> safe<00:00:40.649> to<00:00:40.800> say<00:00:40.829> most<00:00:40.920> of

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
presume that it's safe to say most of

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:42.950 
presume that it's safe to say most of
this<00:00:41.489> stuff<00:00:41.700> is<00:00:41.850> probably<00:00:42.270> going<00:00:42.480> to<00:00:42.540> be<00:00:42.600> true

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
this stuff is probably going to be true

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.709 
this stuff is probably going to be true
if<00:00:43.140> not<00:00:43.410> one<00:00:43.680> hundred<00:00:43.920> percent<00:00:44.190> accurate<00:00:45.120> so

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
if not one hundred percent accurate so

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.389 
if not one hundred percent accurate so
anyway<00:00:46.020> baffled<00:00:46.530> for<00:00:46.800> is<00:00:47.010> going<00:00:47.190> to<00:00:47.250> be

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
anyway baffled for is going to be

around November 2013 which it makes

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.750 
around November 2013 which it makes
sense<00:01:03.719> to<00:01:03.960> be<00:01:04.140> honest<00:01:04.409> because<00:01:04.559> that's<00:01:05.549> what

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
sense to be honest because that's what

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.010 
sense to be honest because that's what
happened<00:01:06.060> last<00:01:06.150> time<00:01:06.330> they<00:01:06.570> kind<00:01:06.810> of<00:01:06.869> went

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
happened last time they kind of went

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.780

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.390 
after that call of duty audience and I
think<00:01:09.000> they're<00:01:09.180> trying<00:01:09.420> to<00:01:09.540> do<00:01:09.750> that<00:01:09.900> again

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:10.400 
think they're trying to do that again

of<00:02:17.620> all<00:02:17.740> just<00:02:17.980> gonna<00:02:18.100> kind<00:02:18.430> of<00:02:18.610> randomly

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
of all just gonna kind of randomly

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:21.180 
of all just gonna kind of randomly
involve<00:02:19.930> themselves<00:02:20.170> in<00:02:20.530> the<00:02:20.650> game<00:02:20.800> and<00:02:21.010> to<00:02:21.070> me

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:21.190 
involve themselves in the game and to me

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:22.560 
involve themselves in the game and to me
I<00:02:21.220> think<00:02:21.460> that's<00:02:21.640> a<00:02:21.760> nice<00:02:21.910> idea<00:02:22.060> i<00:02:22.270> can<00:02:22.420> imagine

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:22.570 
I think that's a nice idea i can imagine

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:24.570 
I think that's a nice idea i can imagine
quite<00:02:22.870> a<00:02:22.930> few<00:02:23.140> people<00:02:23.530> not<00:02:23.980> liking<00:02:24.280> that

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:24.580 
quite a few people not liking that

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:26.400 
quite a few people not liking that
because<00:02:24.970> it<00:02:25.210> might<00:02:25.660> be<00:02:25.720> just<00:02:25.870> a<00:02:26.080> random

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.410 
because it might be just a random

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:27.870 
because it might be just a random
gameplay<00:02:26.650> element<00:02:27.160> that<00:02:27.310> won't<00:02:27.490> help<00:02:27.670> but

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:27.880 
gameplay element that won't help but

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:29.190 
gameplay element that won't help but
with<00:02:28.000> a<00:02:28.030> game<00:02:28.210> right<00:02:28.330> battlefield<00:02:28.900> where<00:02:29.110> you

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200 
with a game right battlefield where you

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:30.780 
with a game right battlefield where you
really<00:02:29.440> want<00:02:29.590> to<00:02:29.710> be<00:02:30.130> a<00:02:30.160> part<00:02:30.520> of<00:02:30.610> the<00:02:30.760> action

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790 
really want to be a part of the action

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:32.760 
really want to be a part of the action
and<00:02:31.300> make<00:02:31.450> it<00:02:31.630> realistic<00:02:32.050> I<00:02:32.350> just<00:02:32.500> think<00:02:32.650> it's

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:32.770 
and make it realistic I just think it's

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:34.080 
and make it realistic I just think it's
gonna<00:02:32.860> make<00:02:33.070> it<00:02:33.190> more<00:02:33.310> realistic<00:02:33.640> which<00:02:33.970> will

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.090 
gonna make it more realistic which will

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:36.150 
gonna make it more realistic which will
be<00:02:34.180> great<00:02:34.390> especially<00:02:34.530> like<00:02:35.530> random<00:02:35.950> rain

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:36.160 
be great especially like random rain

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:37.740 
be great especially like random rain
storms<00:02:36.610> can<00:02:36.760> imagine<00:02:37.030> with<00:02:37.330> battlefield

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
storms can imagine with battlefield

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:39.000 
storms can imagine with battlefield
they'll<00:02:38.140> be<00:02:38.230> able<00:02:38.320> to<00:02:38.440> get<00:02:38.560> some<00:02:38.710> really<00:02:38.860> nice

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
they'll be able to get some really nice

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:40.770 
they'll be able to get some really nice
graphics<00:02:39.610> they<00:02:39.760> always<00:02:39.970> have<00:02:40.120> nice<00:02:40.300> graphics

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:40.780 
graphics they always have nice graphics

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:42.630 
graphics they always have nice graphics
in<00:02:40.960> there<00:02:41.170> the<00:02:41.590> battlefield<00:02:42.070> game<00:02:42.310> i<00:02:42.340> can

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.640 
in there the battlefield game i can

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:44.220 
in there the battlefield game i can
imagine<00:02:42.790> all<00:02:43.060> the<00:02:43.180> water<00:02:43.390> effects<00:02:43.810> and<00:02:44.080> maybe

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:44.230 
imagine all the water effects and maybe

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:45.750 
imagine all the water effects and maybe
will<00:02:44.410> that<00:02:44.590> change<00:02:44.800> gameplay<00:02:45.280> that<00:02:45.460> would<00:02:45.610> be

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:45.760 
will that change gameplay that would be

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:47.820 
will that change gameplay that would be
really<00:02:46.030> next<00:02:46.690> generation<00:02:47.260> if<00:02:47.380> say<00:02:47.530> the<00:02:47.680> rain

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:47.830 
really next generation if say the rain

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:49.230 
really next generation if say the rain
storm<00:02:48.160> came<00:02:48.430> in<00:02:48.670> and<00:02:48.850> there<00:02:48.910> was<00:02:48.970> massive

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:49.240 
storm came in and there was massive

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:51.690 
storm came in and there was massive
puddles<00:02:49.900> that<00:02:50.170> formed<00:02:50.590> and<00:02:50.800> you<00:02:51.100> had<00:02:51.280> to<00:02:51.400> drive

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:51.700 
puddles that formed and you had to drive

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:53.130 
puddles that formed and you had to drive
through<00:02:52.120> them<00:02:52.300> and<00:02:52.480> you<00:02:52.570> drove<00:02:52.810> a<00:02:52.870> little

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:53.140 
through them and you drove a little

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:55.050 
through them and you drove a little
slower<00:02:53.470> through<00:02:53.740> the<00:02:53.860> puddles<00:02:54.250> and<00:02:54.520> things

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:55.060 
slower through the puddles and things

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:56.510 
slower through the puddles and things
like<00:02:55.180> that<00:02:55.240> would<00:02:55.510> be<00:02:55.540> interesting

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:56.520 
like that would be interesting

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:58.410 
like that would be interesting
apparently<00:02:57.520> there's<00:02:57.730> going<00:02:57.940> to<00:02:58.000> be<00:02:58.060> more

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:58.420 
apparently there's going to be more

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:00.210 
apparently there's going to be more
realistic<00:02:58.720> destruction<00:02:59.500> but<00:02:59.620> i<00:02:59.680> suppose<00:02:59.860> that

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:00.220 
realistic destruction but i suppose that

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:02.430 
realistic destruction but i suppose that
is<00:03:00.580> to<00:03:00.850> be<00:03:00.880> expected<00:03:01.150> when<00:03:01.840> you're<00:03:02.020> going<00:03:02.200> for

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:02.440 
is to be expected when you're going for

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:04.590 
is to be expected when you're going for

interesting<00:03:17.980> I<00:03:18.100> love<00:03:18.340> the<00:03:18.489> idea<00:03:18.820> of<00:03:18.910> having

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:19.120 
interesting I love the idea of having

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:21.479 
interesting I love the idea of having
China<00:03:19.600> because<00:03:20.530> China<00:03:20.560> is<00:03:20.920> actually<00:03:21.250> really

00:03:21.479 --> 00:03:21.489 
China because China is actually really

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:23.670 
China because China is actually really
interesting<00:03:22.180> country<00:03:22.810> like<00:03:23.230> I<00:03:23.260> don't<00:03:23.470> think<00:03:23.620> I

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:23.680 
interesting country like I don't think I

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:24.840 
interesting country like I don't think I
can<00:03:23.860> make<00:03:23.950> for<00:03:24.130> some<00:03:24.280> really<00:03:24.640> good

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:24.850 
can make for some really good

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:27.150 
can make for some really good
multiplayer<00:03:25.270> maps<00:03:25.750> there's<00:03:26.530> a<00:03:26.590> lot<00:03:26.800> of<00:03:26.830> kind

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:27.160 
multiplayer maps there's a lot of kind

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:29.610 
multiplayer maps there's a lot of kind
of<00:03:27.310> jungle<00:03:27.610> landscapes<00:03:28.510> and<00:03:28.840> greenery<00:03:29.320> of<00:03:29.440> so

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:29.620 
of jungle landscapes and greenery of so

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:30.720 
of jungle landscapes and greenery of so
you've<00:03:29.739> got<00:03:29.770> things<00:03:30.010> like<00:03:30.160> the<00:03:30.370> Great<00:03:30.550> Wall<00:03:30.580> of

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:30.730 
you've got things like the Great Wall of

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:32.760 
you've got things like the Great Wall of
China<00:03:30.910> I<00:03:31.540> just<00:03:31.930> think<00:03:32.050> having<00:03:32.290> that<00:03:32.410> kind<00:03:32.620> of

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:32.770 
China I just think having that kind of

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:34.620 
China I just think having that kind of
asian<00:03:33.010> look<00:03:33.520> to<00:03:33.670> it<00:03:33.760> really<00:03:34.000> freshen<00:03:34.450> it<00:03:34.510> up

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:34.630 
asian look to it really freshen it up

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:35.790 
asian look to it really freshen it up
because<00:03:34.870> they're<00:03:35.140> so<00:03:35.320> long<00:03:35.530> we've<00:03:35.770> been

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:35.800 
because they're so long we've been

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:38.850 
because they're so long we've been
playing<00:03:36.160> as<00:03:36.340> Russians<00:03:36.880> and<00:03:37.840> obviously<00:03:38.290> USA

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:38.860 
playing as Russians and obviously USA

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:40.650 
playing as Russians and obviously USA
over<00:03:39.100> there<00:03:39.250> USA<00:03:39.640> win<00:03:39.790> again<00:03:40.090> but<00:03:40.270> I<00:03:40.300> think<00:03:40.570> the

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:40.660 
over there USA win again but I think the

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:42.900 
over there USA win again but I think the
idea<00:03:40.690> of<00:03:40.989> having<00:03:41.140> it<00:03:41.350> in<00:03:41.470> like<00:03:41.650> an<00:03:41.830> Asian<00:03:42.640> based

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:42.910 
idea of having it in like an Asian based

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:44.940 
idea of having it in like an Asian based
country<00:03:43.480> is<00:03:43.660> going<00:03:43.810> to<00:03:43.900> be<00:03:44.019> really<00:03:44.350> good<00:03:44.530> so<00:03:44.920> I

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:44.950 
country is going to be really good so I

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:47.070 
country is going to be really good so I
mean<00:03:45.310> in<00:03:45.519> my<00:03:45.730> mind<00:03:45.760> I<00:03:46.120> could<00:03:46.269> just<00:03:46.450> already<00:03:46.810> see

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:47.080 
mean in my mind I could just already see

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:49.259 
mean in my mind I could just already see
the<00:03:47.110> visions<00:03:47.560> of<00:03:47.680> all<00:03:48.130> these<00:03:48.400> amazing<00:03:48.790> maps

00:03:49.259 --> 00:03:49.269 
the visions of all these amazing maps

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:50.850 
the visions of all these amazing maps
based<00:03:49.570> around<00:03:49.810> tryouts<00:03:50.320> are<00:03:50.440> definitely

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:50.860 
based around tryouts are definitely

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:52.410 
based around tryouts are definitely
looking<00:03:50.980> forward<00:03:51.310> to<00:03:51.489> that<00:03:51.610> one<00:03:51.760> if<00:03:51.970> that

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:52.420 
looking forward to that one if that

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:55.170 
looking forward to that one if that
one's<00:03:52.600> ends<00:03:52.989> up<00:03:53.110> being<00:03:53.290> true<00:03:54.180> apparently

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:55.180 
one's ends up being true apparently

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:57.500 
one's ends up being true apparently
there<00:03:55.360> i<00:03:55.390> improved<00:03:56.110> modification<00:03:57.010> and

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:57.510 
there i improved modification and

00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:59.160 
there i improved modification and
customizations<00:03:58.510> but<00:03:58.720> again<00:03:58.989> that's

00:03:59.160 --> 00:03:59.170 
customizations but again that's

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:00.990 
customizations but again that's
something<00:03:59.500> that<00:03:59.530> pretty<00:03:59.830> much<00:03:59.980> most<00:04:00.400> games<00:04:00.790> at

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:01.000 
something that pretty much most games at

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.090 
something that pretty much most games at
the<00:04:01.090> moment<00:04:01.390> are<00:04:01.480> really<00:04:01.810> hammering<00:04:02.470> down<00:04:02.800> on

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:03.100 
the moment are really hammering down on

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:04.820 
the moment are really hammering down on
so<00:04:03.370> possibly<00:04:03.820> there's<00:04:04.239> going<00:04:04.390> to<00:04:04.450> be

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:04.830 
so possibly there's going to be

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:06.720 
so possibly there's going to be
microtransactions<00:04:05.830> i<00:04:05.980> mean<00:04:06.130> call<00:04:06.310> of<00:04:06.400> jr

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:06.730 
microtransactions i mean call of jr

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:08.699 
microtransactions i mean call of jr
doing<00:04:07.000> it<00:04:07.120> now<00:04:07.269> I<00:04:07.480> would<00:04:07.900> be<00:04:08.050> very<00:04:08.080> surprised

00:04:08.699 --> 00:04:08.709 
doing it now I would be very surprised

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:11.580 
doing it now I would be very surprised
if<00:04:08.890> a<00:04:09.220> black<00:04:09.459> of<00:04:09.730> black<00:04:10.420> ops<00:04:10.630> if<00:04:10.810> battlefield<00:04:11.320> 4

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:11.590 
if a black of black ops if battlefield 4

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:13.949 
if a black of black ops if battlefield 4
doesn't<00:04:12.310> end<00:04:12.459> up<00:04:12.610> doing<00:04:12.959> microtransactions

00:04:13.949 --> 00:04:13.959 
doesn't end up doing microtransactions

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:16.590 
doesn't end up doing microtransactions
as<00:04:14.200> well<00:04:14.440> and<00:04:15.340> there's<00:04:16.180> going<00:04:16.299> to<00:04:16.359> be<00:04:16.390> more
