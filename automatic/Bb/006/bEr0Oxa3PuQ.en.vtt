00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:09.630 
your clients are shown in Matt we're

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:12.680 
your clients are shown in Matt we're
here<00:00:09.870> to<00:00:09.990> do<00:00:10.230> a<00:00:10.260> cipher<00:00:10.740> tutorial<00:00:11.510> at<00:00:12.510> the

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
here to do a cipher tutorial at the

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:14.900 
here to do a cipher tutorial at the
start<00:00:13.020> you<00:00:13.410> need<00:00:13.680> just<00:00:14.070> like<00:00:14.280> a<00:00:14.309> surface<00:00:14.730> like

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
start you need just like a surface like

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.029 
start you need just like a surface like
this<00:00:15.080> this<00:00:16.080> is<00:00:16.199> because<00:00:16.470> we<00:00:16.590> don't<00:00:16.740> have<00:00:16.770> like

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
this this is because we don't have like

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:19.100 
this this is because we don't have like
a<00:00:17.070> proper<00:00:17.340> mattress<00:00:17.789> to<00:00:17.940> take<00:00:18.150> out<00:00:18.360> we're<00:00:18.990> just

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:19.110 
a proper mattress to take out we're just

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:20.960 
a proper mattress to take out we're just
using<00:00:19.289> this<00:00:19.560> soft<00:00:19.830> bark<00:00:20.100> but<00:00:20.369> jumping<00:00:20.699> off<00:00:20.850> the

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
using this soft bark but jumping off the

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.540 
using this soft bark but jumping off the
hard<00:00:21.150> grass<00:00:21.449> all<00:00:22.260> right<00:00:22.440> for<00:00:22.679> the<00:00:22.769> start<00:00:23.099> the

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
hard grass all right for the start the

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.550 
hard grass all right for the start the
person<00:00:23.880> doesn't<00:00:24.060> really<00:00:24.359> like<00:00:25.109> Matt<00:00:25.349> doesn't

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
person doesn't really like Matt doesn't

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.320 
person doesn't really like Matt doesn't
know<00:00:25.890> how<00:00:26.070> to<00:00:26.130> do<00:00:26.279> a<00:00:26.310> full<00:00:26.580> cycle<00:00:26.970> yet<00:00:27.119> so<00:00:27.269> i'm

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
know how to do a full cycle yet so i'm

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:28.300 
know how to do a full cycle yet so i'm
going<00:00:27.419> to<00:00:27.480> teach<00:00:27.630> him<00:00:27.779> through<00:00:27.960> this<00:00:28.080> tutorial

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:28.310 
going to teach him through this tutorial

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:30.499 
going to teach him through this tutorial
but<00:00:29.310> he<00:00:29.460> doesn't<00:00:29.789> know<00:00:29.820> where<00:00:30.029> to<00:00:30.060> jump<00:00:30.330> from

00:00:30.499 --> 00:00:30.509 
but he doesn't know where to jump from

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:32.870 
but he doesn't know where to jump from
and<00:00:30.779> where<00:00:30.929> to<00:00:31.019> land<00:00:31.230> so<00:00:31.980> i<00:00:32.009> always<00:00:32.250> put<00:00:32.579> a

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
and where to land so i always put a

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.319 
and where to land so i always put a
person<00:00:33.570> like<00:00:33.750> this<00:00:34.610> hunched<00:00:35.610> over<00:00:35.730> for<00:00:36.270> the

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
person like this hunched over for the

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:37.970 
person like this hunched over for the
person<00:00:36.660> to<00:00:36.690> side<00:00:36.930> flip<00:00:37.140> over<00:00:37.500> now<00:00:37.800> i'm<00:00:37.890> going

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
person to side flip over now i'm going

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.220 
person to side flip over now i'm going
to<00:00:38.040> get<00:00:38.190> mad<00:00:38.400> just<00:00:38.730> to<00:00:39.270> roll<00:00:39.539> over<00:00:39.570> my<00:00:40.020> back

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
to get mad just to roll over my back

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:49.010 
to get mad just to roll over my back
first<00:00:40.530> oh<00:00:46.129> alright<00:00:47.129> that's<00:00:47.520> scary<00:00:47.899> that's<00:00:48.899> the

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
first oh alright that's scary that's the

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.360 
first oh alright that's scary that's the
first<00:00:49.199> progression<00:00:49.649> it<00:00:49.739> looks<00:00:49.890> really<00:00:50.039> bad

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
first progression it looks really bad

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.220 
first progression it looks really bad
but<00:00:50.699> at<00:00:51.149> least<00:00:51.269> we<00:00:51.420> get<00:00:51.570> some<00:00:51.629> use<00:00:51.899> of<00:00:52.079> that

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
but at least we get some use of that

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.250 
but at least we get some use of that
sideways<00:00:53.190> like<00:00:53.969> you<00:00:54.359> people<00:00:54.629> who<00:00:54.870> use<00:00:55.079> the

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
sideways like you people who use the

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.919 
sideways like you people who use the
backwards<00:00:55.800> and<00:00:56.010> fun<00:00:56.219> twist<00:00:56.430> but<00:00:57.180> stive<00:00:57.660> ways

00:00:57.919 --> 00:00:57.929 
backwards and fun twist but stive ways

00:00:57.929 --> 00:00:59.450 
backwards and fun twist but stive ways
is<00:00:58.140> just<00:00:58.320> different<00:00:58.620> and<00:00:58.859> it's<00:00:59.070> really<00:00:59.250> hard

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
is just different and it's really hard

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.540 
is just different and it's really hard
to<00:00:59.609> learn<00:01:00.260> so<00:01:01.260> now<00:01:01.559> he's<00:01:01.800> just<00:01:02.010> going<00:01:02.129> to<00:01:02.219> roll

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
to learn so now he's just going to roll

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.819 
to learn so now he's just going to roll
a<00:01:02.579> bit<00:01:02.820> faster

00:01:06.819 --> 00:01:06.829 

00:01:06.829 --> 00:01:09.889 

whoa<00:01:07.829> okay<00:01:08.250> so<00:01:08.640> that's<00:01:08.820> the<00:01:08.850> first<00:01:09.060> thing<00:01:09.180> and

00:01:09.889 --> 00:01:09.899 
whoa okay so that's the first thing and

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:11.420 
whoa okay so that's the first thing and
now<00:01:10.110> he's<00:01:10.320> going<00:01:10.500> to<00:01:10.560> start<00:01:10.799> like<00:01:11.040> trying<00:01:11.369> to

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
now he's going to start like trying to

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.310 
now he's going to start like trying to
dive<00:01:12.030> over<00:01:12.360> my<00:01:12.479> back<00:01:12.659> and<00:01:12.810> actually<00:01:12.990> start

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
dive over my back and actually start

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.800 
dive over my back and actually start
going<00:01:13.740> for<00:01:13.920> the<00:01:13.979> side<00:01:14.189> flip<00:01:14.520> you<00:01:15.210> actually

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
going for the side flip you actually

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.200 
going for the side flip you actually
need<00:01:15.960> to<00:01:15.990> like<00:01:16.399> pluck<00:01:17.399> up<00:01:17.520> the<00:01:17.580> courage<00:01:17.670> to<00:01:18.030> do

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
need to like pluck up the courage to do

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:26.030 
need to like pluck up the courage to do
this<00:01:18.360> one<00:01:18.570> it's<00:01:18.750> not<00:01:18.840> easy

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.320 

oh<00:01:28.190> that's<00:01:29.190> why<00:01:29.400> you<00:01:29.460> need<00:01:29.760> to<00:01:29.850> always<00:01:30.000> have

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:30.330 
oh that's why you need to always have

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:31.940 
oh that's why you need to always have
like<00:01:30.510> a<00:01:30.540> mattress<00:01:30.840> or<00:01:31.170> soft<00:01:31.410> surface<00:01:31.770> here

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
like a mattress or soft surface here

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:37.160 
like a mattress or soft surface here
okay<00:01:33.110> so<00:01:34.110> after<00:01:34.410> you've<00:01:34.740> tried<00:01:34.980> that<00:01:35.130> a<00:01:35.190> bit<00:01:36.170> he

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
okay so after you've tried that a bit he

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:38.840 
okay so after you've tried that a bit he
should<00:01:37.350> start<00:01:37.620> getting<00:01:37.950> closer<00:01:38.310> to<00:01:38.460> land<00:01:38.730> in

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
should start getting closer to land in

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.460 
should start getting closer to land in
it<00:01:39.710> so<00:01:40.710> if<00:01:40.860> he<00:01:40.980> goes<00:01:41.160> up<00:01:41.690> always<00:01:42.690> like<00:01:43.260> with

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
it so if he goes up always like with

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.950 
it so if he goes up always like with
backflip<00:01:43.920> since<00:01:44.160> that<00:01:44.460> the<00:01:45.240> front<00:01:45.540> flips<00:01:45.780> it's

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
backflip since that the front flips it's

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.170 
backflip since that the front flips it's
that<00:01:46.200> with<00:01:46.620> side<00:01:46.860> flips<00:01:47.190> you<00:01:47.430> just<00:01:47.850> pull<00:01:48.090> the

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
that with side flips you just pull the

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.390 
that with side flips you just pull the
sideways<00:01:48.570> and<00:01:48.750> then<00:01:48.870> pull<00:01:49.080> in<00:01:49.229> so<00:01:50.070> he's<00:01:50.250> going

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:50.400 
sideways and then pull in so he's going

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:53.060 
sideways and then pull in so he's going
to<00:01:50.460> try<00:01:50.610> that<00:01:50.820> now<00:01:50.970> and<00:01:51.240> jump<00:01:51.479> stomp<00:01:52.320> two<00:01:52.770> feet

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
to try that now and jump stomp two feet

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:57.200 
to try that now and jump stomp two feet
you<00:01:53.370> either<00:01:53.550> got<00:01:54.080> one<00:01:55.080> too<00:01:55.440> or<00:01:55.800> you<00:01:56.580> can<00:01:56.729> run<00:01:57.000> up

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
you either got one too or you can run up

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.630 
you either got one too or you can run up
and<00:01:57.810> drop<00:01:58.050> off<00:01:58.200> two<00:01:58.440> feet<00:01:58.740> it<00:01:59.280> doesn't<00:01:59.550> really

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
and drop off two feet it doesn't really

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.520 
and drop off two feet it doesn't really
matter<00:01:59.850> which<00:02:00.060> one<00:02:00.240> you<00:02:00.270> do<00:02:00.450> Matt<00:02:01.259> here<00:02:01.500> I

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
matter which one you do Matt here I

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.370 
matter which one you do Matt here I
think<00:02:01.740> he's<00:02:01.860> trying<00:02:01.920> for<00:02:02.280> the<00:02:02.340> 12<00:02:02.960> okay<00:02:03.960> so

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
think he's trying for the 12 okay so

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.740 
think he's trying for the 12 okay so
he's<00:02:04.590> going<00:02:04.770> to<00:02:04.830> do<00:02:04.979> 12<00:02:05.430> and<00:02:05.700> put<00:02:06.210> his<00:02:06.330> hands<00:02:06.660> up

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
he's going to do 12 and put his hands up
