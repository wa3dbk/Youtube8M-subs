instead mangroves half an inch every
month<00:01:26.350> and<00:01:26.649> a<00:01:26.770> half<00:01:27.570> so<00:01:28.570> in<00:01:29.170> a<00:01:30.009> year's<00:01:30.340> time<00:01:30.450> my

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:31.450 
month and a half so in a year's time my

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:35.880 
month and a half so in a year's time my
hair<00:01:31.719> should<00:01:32.020> grow<00:01:32.700> four<00:01:33.700> inches<00:01:34.329> so<00:01:34.740> if<00:01:35.740> I

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:35.890 
hair should grow four inches so if I

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:37.889

00:01:37.889 --> 00:01:37.899 
were to put this at the bottom of my

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:41.520 
were to put this at the bottom of my
hair<00:01:38.140> right<00:01:38.469> here<00:01:39.179> and<00:01:40.179> that's<00:01:40.719> four<00:01:41.140> inches

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:41.530 
hair right here and that's four inches

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:44.910 
hair right here and that's four inches
down<00:01:42.210> technically<00:01:43.210> my<00:01:43.299> hair<00:01:43.689> should<00:01:43.929> be<00:01:44.049> right

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:44.920 
down technically my hair should be right

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:49.859 
down technically my hair should be right
here<00:01:44.950> a<00:01:45.490> year<00:01:46.299> from<00:01:46.359> now<00:01:46.569> so<00:01:48.030> well<00:01:49.030> I<00:01:49.450> don't

00:01:49.859 --> 00:01:49.869 
here a year from now so well I don't

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:53.129 
here a year from now so well I don't
think<00:01:49.899> it<00:01:50.229> made<00:01:50.439> my<00:01:50.619> hair<00:01:50.829> grow<00:01:51.039> faster<00:01:51.749> but<00:01:52.749> I

00:01:53.129 --> 00:01:53.139 
think it made my hair grow faster but I

00:01:53.139 --> 00:01:54.989 
think it made my hair grow faster but I
do<00:01:53.350> think<00:01:53.649> it<00:01:53.829> made<00:01:54.009> it<00:01:54.249> a<00:01:54.429> little<00:01:54.670> stronger

00:01:54.989 --> 00:01:54.999 
do think it made it a little stronger

00:01:54.999 --> 00:01:57.450 
do think it made it a little stronger
because<00:01:55.509> my<00:01:55.659> hair<00:01:55.869> used<00:01:56.049> to<00:01:56.109> shed<00:01:56.439> a<00:01:56.469> light<00:01:56.740> and

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:57.460 
because my hair used to shed a light and

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:59.429 
because my hair used to shed a light and
now<00:01:57.639> it<00:01:57.939> seems<00:01:58.179> like<00:01:58.359> my<00:01:59.020> hair<00:01:59.200> is<00:01:59.229> a<00:01:59.319> little

00:01:59.429 --> 00:01:59.439 
now it seems like my hair is a little

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:01.590 
now it seems like my hair is a little
stronger<00:01:59.889> than<00:02:00.189> it<00:02:00.310> with<00:02:00.490> fans<00:02:00.819> blow<00:02:01.270> drying

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:01.600 
stronger than it with fans blow drying

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:03.959 
stronger than it with fans blow drying
and<00:02:01.929> constant<00:02:02.649> combing<00:02:03.280> and<00:02:03.399> brushing<00:02:03.459> and

00:02:03.959 --> 00:02:03.969

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:06.749 
and constant combing and brushing and
wrapping<00:02:04.420> at<00:02:04.539> night<00:02:04.749> and<00:02:05.530> as<00:02:05.859> far<00:02:06.069> as<00:02:06.130> my<00:02:06.399> skin
