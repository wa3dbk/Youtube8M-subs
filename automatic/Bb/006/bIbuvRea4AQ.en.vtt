00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
never had troubles with them so here is

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:57.170 
never had troubles with them so here is
my<00:00:48.180> futaba<00:00:48.660> 10c<00:00:49.260> let's<00:00:49.680> check<00:00:52.610> Ella<00:00:53.610> ROM<00:00:56.180> and

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
my futaba 10c let's check Ella ROM and

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.479 
my futaba 10c let's check Ella ROM and
later

00:01:00.479 --> 00:01:00.489 

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:09.120

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:09.130 
and rudder all good and our trouble is

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:17.040 
and rudder all good and our trouble is
working<00:01:09.580> as<00:01:09.700> well<00:01:14.549> all<00:01:15.549> right<00:01:15.729> so<00:01:16.270> now<00:01:16.659> the

working as well all right so now the

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:19.590 
working as well all right so now the
next<00:01:17.320> stage<00:01:17.680> is<00:01:18.009> the<00:01:18.280> most<00:01:18.850> critical<00:01:19.180> one

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:19.600 
next stage is the most critical one

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.859 
next stage is the most critical one
which<00:01:19.990> is<00:01:20.460> installing<00:01:21.460> the<00:01:21.640> engine<00:01:22.060> so<00:01:22.540> there

00:01:22.859 --> 00:01:22.869 
which is installing the engine so there

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:25.320 
which is installing the engine so there
was<00:01:23.020> this<00:01:23.200> question<00:01:23.500> by<00:01:23.860> somebody<00:01:24.310> what<00:01:25.000> to<00:01:25.119> do

was this question by somebody what to do
and<00:01:25.570> how<00:01:25.930> to<00:01:25.960> prepare<00:01:26.380> microplane<00:01:27.100> for<00:01:27.369> the

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:27.460 
and how to prepare microplane for the

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:30.590 
and how to prepare microplane for the
beginners<00:01:27.850> I<00:01:28.060> mean<00:01:28.300> for<00:01:28.479> the<00:01:28.540> first<00:01:28.570> timers<00:01:29.070> so

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
beginners I mean for the first timers so

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.270

put the elevators very very equal or
parallel<00:02:16.870> to<00:02:16.930> them<00:02:17.290> okay<00:02:17.890> similarly<00:02:18.220> you<00:02:18.670> can

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:18.880 
parallel to them okay similarly you can

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:23.370 
parallel to them okay similarly you can
see<00:02:19.150> what<00:02:19.690> I<00:02:19.720> mean<00:02:20.049> rudder<00:02:20.410> is<00:02:20.500> right<00:02:21.310> exact<00:02:22.380> in

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:23.380 
see what I mean rudder is right exact in

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:25.949 
see what I mean rudder is right exact in
center<00:02:24.040> so<00:02:24.489> keep<00:02:24.820> all<00:02:25.030> the<00:02:25.150> surfaces<00:02:25.510> Center

00:02:25.949 --> 00:02:25.959 
center so keep all the surfaces Center

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:28.410 
center so keep all the surfaces Center
once<00:02:26.350> you<00:02:26.530> have<00:02:26.680> done<00:02:26.920> that<00:02:27.150> finally<00:02:28.150> comes

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420 
once you have done that finally comes

once you have done that finally comes
the<00:02:28.630> engine<00:02:28.959> now<00:02:29.470> for<00:02:29.890> me<00:02:30.010> whenever<00:02:30.610> I'm

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:30.940 
the engine now for me whenever I'm

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:34.800 
the engine now for me whenever I'm
installing<00:02:31.329> the<00:02:31.570> engine<00:02:31.930> I<00:02:33.030> always<00:02:34.030> ruin<00:02:34.329> the

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:34.810 
installing the engine I always ruin the

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:37.500 
installing the engine I always ruin the
beauty<00:02:35.230> of<00:02:35.440> the<00:02:35.620> plane<00:02:35.829> especially<00:02:36.489> I<00:02:37.000> always

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510 
beauty of the plane especially I always

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:41.250 
beauty of the plane especially I always
ruin<00:02:37.720> the<00:02:38.380> beautiful<00:02:38.769> cowling<00:02:39.340> so<00:02:40.150> here<00:02:41.019> we<00:02:41.110> go

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:41.260

the first thing you need to do about

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:45.569 
the first thing you need to do about
installing<00:02:43.720> the<00:02:43.959> engine<00:02:44.320> is<00:02:44.500> make<00:02:45.010> sure<00:02:45.040> which

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:45.579 
installing the engine is make sure which

00:02:45.579 --> 00:02:48.360 
installing the engine is make sure which
way<00:02:45.910> engine<00:02:46.180> will<00:02:46.600> actually<00:02:47.079> fit<00:02:47.440> without

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:48.370 
way engine will actually fit without

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:51.599 
way engine will actually fit without
harming<00:02:48.940> the<00:02:49.450> cowling<00:02:50.440> actually<00:02:50.890> okay

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:51.609 
harming the cowling actually okay

00:02:51.609 --> 00:02:53.520 
harming the cowling actually okay
so<00:02:51.970> basically<00:02:52.390> you<00:02:52.630> can<00:02:52.780> put<00:02:53.019> the<00:02:53.140> engine

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:53.530 
so basically you can put the engine

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:56.460 
so basically you can put the engine
somewhere<00:02:54.010> and<00:02:54.310> see<00:02:55.000> if<00:02:55.299> I<00:02:55.900> put<00:02:56.109> the<00:02:56.200> engine

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:56.470 
somewhere and see if I put the engine

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:58.800 
somewhere and see if I put the engine
this<00:02:56.650> way<00:02:56.890> here<00:02:57.280> I<00:02:57.310> will<00:02:57.609> see<00:02:57.850> the<00:02:58.299> engine<00:02:58.630> head

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:58.810 
this way here I will see the engine head

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:01.140 
this way here I will see the engine head
is<00:02:58.989> out<00:02:59.200> of<00:02:59.440> the<00:02:59.560> cowling<00:02:59.980> so<00:03:00.459> the<00:03:00.880> best

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:01.150 
is out of the cowling so the best

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:03.370 
is out of the cowling so the best
position<00:03:01.870> for<00:03:01.900> this<00:03:02.320> gas<00:03:02.650> guess

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:03.380 
position for this gas guess

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:06.100 
position for this gas guess
engine<00:03:03.800> is<00:03:04.040> that<00:03:04.730> I<00:03:04.790> mounted<00:03:05.390> upside<00:03:05.630> down

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:06.110 
engine is that I mounted upside down

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:09.940 
engine is that I mounted upside down
this<00:03:06.440> way<00:03:06.820> keeping<00:03:07.820> the<00:03:08.410> shaft<00:03:09.410> the<00:03:09.740> main

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:09.950 
this way keeping the shaft the main

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:12.610 
this way keeping the shaft the main
shaft<00:03:10.220> exactly<00:03:11.150> to<00:03:11.360> the<00:03:11.480> center<00:03:11.840> on<00:03:12.020> that<00:03:12.290> hole

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:12.620 
shaft exactly to the center on that hole

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:18.910 
shaft exactly to the center on that hole
okay<00:03:13.610> and<00:03:15.490> you<00:03:16.490> can<00:03:16.670> see<00:03:17.060> that<00:03:17.720> now<00:03:18.020> it<00:03:18.500> will

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:18.920 
okay and you can see that now it will

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:21.970 
okay and you can see that now it will
actually<00:03:19.210> basically<00:03:20.210> fix<00:03:20.800> inside<00:03:21.800> the

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:21.980 
actually basically fix inside the

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:24.580 
actually basically fix inside the
cowling<00:03:22.490> pretty<00:03:22.880> much<00:03:23.120> well<00:03:23.630> the<00:03:24.110> only<00:03:24.410> thing

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:24.590 
cowling pretty much well the only thing

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:28.660 
cowling pretty much well the only thing
is<00:03:24.860> the<00:03:25.450> muffler<00:03:26.450> is<00:03:26.630> going<00:03:27.620> upwards<00:03:28.220> well<00:03:28.640> I

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:28.670 
is the muffler is going upwards well I

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:30.850 
is the muffler is going upwards well I
can<00:03:28.970> always<00:03:29.120> change<00:03:29.630> the<00:03:29.870> screws<00:03:30.200> and<00:03:30.410> make<00:03:30.650> it

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:30.860 
can always change the screws and make it

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:34.510 
can always change the screws and make it
point<00:03:31.160> downwards<00:03:31.880> okay<00:03:32.750> so<00:03:33.290> I'm<00:03:33.680> gonna<00:03:34.010> do

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:34.520 
point downwards okay so I'm gonna do

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:37.450 
point downwards okay so I'm gonna do
this<00:03:34.850> way<00:03:35.120> and<00:03:35.590> for<00:03:36.590> all<00:03:36.740> the<00:03:36.890> beginners<00:03:37.280> here

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:37.460 
this way and for all the beginners here

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:39.400 
this way and for all the beginners here
first<00:03:37.730> thing<00:03:37.940> you<00:03:38.000> need<00:03:38.150> to<00:03:38.210> do<00:03:38.480> see<00:03:38.900> which<00:03:39.200> way

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:39.410 
first thing you need to do see which way

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:42.460 
first thing you need to do see which way
engine<00:03:39.650> will<00:03:39.920> mount<00:03:40.130> well<00:03:40.430> and<00:03:40.730> then<00:03:41.420> mark<00:03:42.080> the

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:42.470 
engine will mount well and then mark the

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:44.800 
engine will mount well and then mark the
engine<00:03:43.220> at<00:03:43.430> their<00:03:44.330> point

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:44.810 
engine at their point

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:46.900 
engine at their point
this<00:03:44.960> is<00:03:45.110> gasser<00:03:45.320> engine<00:03:45.770> so<00:03:45.980> it's<00:03:46.100> fixing<00:03:46.700> on

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:46.910 
this is gasser engine so it's fixing on

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:49.480 
this is gasser engine so it's fixing on
these<00:03:47.120> four<00:03:47.570> pillars<00:03:47.840> but<00:03:48.650> if<00:03:49.190> you<00:03:49.340> have<00:03:49.460> a

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:49.490 
these four pillars but if you have a

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:51.850 
these four pillars but if you have a
nitro<00:03:49.880> engine<00:03:50.210> it<00:03:50.330> will<00:03:50.480> fix<00:03:50.750> on<00:03:50.990> those<00:03:51.410> two

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:51.860 
nitro engine it will fix on those two

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:54.400 
nitro engine it will fix on those two
engine<00:03:52.760> mounts<00:03:53.060> so<00:03:53.420> anyway<00:03:53.780> first<00:03:54.020> you<00:03:54.230> need

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:54.410 
engine mounts so anyway first you need

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:57.280 
engine mounts so anyway first you need
to<00:03:54.560> mount<00:03:54.740> the<00:03:54.980> engine<00:03:55.160> okay<00:03:56.060> a<00:03:56.270> rough<00:03:56.870> draft

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:57.290 
to mount the engine okay a rough draft

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:59.800 
to mount the engine okay a rough draft
somehow<00:03:58.010> try<00:03:58.340> to<00:03:58.370> paste<00:03:58.850> it<00:03:59.120> and<00:03:59.330> use<00:03:59.480> some

00:03:59.800 --> 00:03:59.810 
somehow try to paste it and use some

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:01.900 
somehow try to paste it and use some
scotch<00:04:00.320> tape<00:04:00.470> or<00:04:00.920> whatever<00:04:01.130> tape<00:04:01.520> you<00:04:01.670> find

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:01.910 
scotch tape or whatever tape you find

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:04.270 
scotch tape or whatever tape you find
put<00:04:02.510> the<00:04:02.630> engine<00:04:02.930> there<00:04:03.140> and<00:04:03.350> put<00:04:03.590> the<00:04:03.710> cowling

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:04.280 
put the engine there and put the cowling

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:07.390 
put the engine there and put the cowling
on<00:04:04.550> to<00:04:04.940> see<00:04:05.240> if<00:04:05.660> engine<00:04:06.140> fits<00:04:06.380> right<00:04:06.680> in<00:04:07.040> and

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:07.400 
on to see if engine fits right in and

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:10.270 
on to see if engine fits right in and
all<00:04:07.670> you<00:04:07.880> have<00:04:08.060> to<00:04:08.210> do<00:04:08.330> minimum<00:04:09.160> you<00:04:10.160> know

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:10.280 
all you have to do minimum you know

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:12.400 
all you have to do minimum you know
modifications<00:04:11.030> on<00:04:11.210> the<00:04:11.360> cowling<00:04:11.720> once<00:04:12.260> you

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:12.410 
modifications on the cowling once you

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:14.380 
modifications on the cowling once you
find<00:04:12.650> the<00:04:12.770> right<00:04:12.920> place<00:04:13.280> you<00:04:13.760> can<00:04:13.970> go<00:04:14.210> ahead

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:14.390 
find the right place you can go ahead

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:17.320 
find the right place you can go ahead
drill<00:04:15.170> the<00:04:15.380> holes<00:04:15.590> and<00:04:15.970> mount<00:04:16.970> the<00:04:17.150> engine

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:17.330 
drill the holes and mount the engine

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:19.170 
drill the holes and mount the engine
there<00:04:17.720> the<00:04:18.080> next<00:04:18.350> step<00:04:18.650> is<00:04:18.770> of<00:04:18.950> course

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:19.180 
there the next step is of course

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:22.300 
there the next step is of course
mounting<00:04:20.180> or<00:04:20.420> bringing<00:04:20.810> in<00:04:21.049> the<00:04:21.530> connecting

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:22.310 
mounting or bringing in the connecting

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:25.600 
mounting or bringing in the connecting
rod<00:04:22.490> to<00:04:22.910> the<00:04:23.360> throttle<00:04:24.050> or<00:04:24.440> the<00:04:24.680> carb<00:04:24.980> carb<00:04:25.460> II

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:25.610 
rod to the throttle or the carb carb II

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:29.410 
rod to the throttle or the carb carb II
so<00:04:26.150> you<00:04:26.180> can<00:04:26.420> control<00:04:26.750> the<00:04:26.900> engine<00:04:27.200> or
