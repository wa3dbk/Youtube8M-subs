00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
there's a couple things I want to talk

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:17.779 
there's a couple things I want to talk
about<00:00:15.929> the<00:00:16.350> first<00:00:16.590> one<00:00:16.830> is<00:00:17.100> that<00:00:17.130> as<00:00:17.490> you<00:00:17.640> can

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
about the first one is that as you can

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:19.429 
about the first one is that as you can
see<00:00:18.029> the<00:00:18.240> squat<00:00:18.570> rack<00:00:18.810> was<00:00:19.050> really

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
see the squat rack was really

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:21.410 
see the squat rack was really
inconvenient<00:00:20.189> because<00:00:20.820> they've<00:00:21.150> set<00:00:21.390> a

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
inconvenient because they've set a

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.420 
inconvenient because they've set a
height<00:00:21.840> where<00:00:22.170> you<00:00:22.320> had<00:00:22.500> the<00:00:22.650> squat<00:00:22.980> maybe<00:00:23.310> a

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
height where you had the squat maybe a

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.970 
height where you had the squat maybe a
little<00:00:23.699> bit<00:00:23.939> high<00:00:24.180> or<00:00:24.570> you<00:00:25.230> had<00:00:25.350> to<00:00:25.470> back<00:00:25.710> all

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
little bit high or you had to back all

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.250 
little bit high or you had to back all
the<00:00:26.189> way<00:00:26.220> out<00:00:26.460> of<00:00:26.609> the<00:00:26.699> rack<00:00:26.939> so<00:00:27.750> what<00:00:27.930> I<00:00:27.960> ended

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
the way out of the rack so what I ended

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.380 
the way out of the rack so what I ended
up<00:00:28.380> doing<00:00:28.439> was<00:00:29.130> just<00:00:29.160> squatting<00:00:29.820> in<00:00:30.060> the<00:00:30.090> rack

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
up doing was just squatting in the rack

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.780 
up doing was just squatting in the rack
and<00:00:30.689> I<00:00:31.140> decided<00:00:31.560> to<00:00:31.679> just<00:00:32.009> switch<00:00:32.309> to<00:00:32.340> pause

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
and I decided to just switch to pause

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.180 
and I decided to just switch to pause
squats<00:00:33.329> so<00:00:34.020> then<00:00:34.170> I<00:00:34.260> could<00:00:34.440> go<00:00:34.530> as<00:00:34.680> deep<00:00:34.980> as

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
squats so then I could go as deep as

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:36.830 
squats so then I could go as deep as
possible<00:00:35.790> without<00:00:35.910> actually<00:00:36.390> hitting<00:00:36.630> the

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
possible without actually hitting the

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.139 
possible without actually hitting the
rack<00:00:37.110> now<00:00:37.770> I<00:00:37.800> will<00:00:38.040> say<00:00:38.190> right<00:00:38.399> now<00:00:38.460> that<00:00:38.640> made

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
rack now I will say right now that made

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.119 
rack now I will say right now that made
me<00:00:39.329> squat<00:00:39.629> higher<00:00:39.930> than<00:00:40.170> I<00:00:40.260> wanted<00:00:40.590> to<00:00:40.710> in<00:00:40.920> this

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
workout because I really didn't have a

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.650

because I think a lot of people
underestimate<00:01:45.000> him<00:01:45.630> and<00:01:45.780> underestimate<00:01:46.320> both

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
person like I said earlier the depth on

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:22.300 
person like I said earlier the depth on
these<00:02:20.430> squats<00:02:20.760> is<00:02:20.970> not<00:02:21.420> great<00:02:21.930> it's

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
squat in the IPF meet because the IPF

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.990 
squat in the IPF meet because the IPF
meet<00:02:27.660> of<00:02:27.810> course<00:02:28.110> is<00:02:28.290> extremely<00:02:28.590> strict<00:02:29.310> so

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
this is only as I said because of the

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.550 
this is only as I said because of the
squat<00:02:32.760> rack<00:02:33.090> that<00:02:33.450> I<00:02:33.750> had<00:02:33.959> to<00:02:34.110> cut<00:02:34.380> it<00:02:34.530> short

00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:37.739 
but anyways it still is a very big PR

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:40.460

later on I did a back offset of 504 too
and<00:02:46.560> that<00:02:47.070> felt<00:02:47.310> very<00:02:47.700> good<00:02:48.030> that<00:02:48.300> felt<00:02:48.540> very

now going into my next workout I'm

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:56.420 
now going into my next workout I'm
extremely<00:02:54.540> optimistic<00:02:54.840> as<00:02:55.709> I<00:02:55.980> said<00:02:56.220> this

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
extremely optimistic as I said this

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:58.490 
extremely optimistic as I said this
workout<00:02:56.790> felt<00:02:57.120> just<00:02:57.390> way<00:02:57.720> better<00:02:58.080> than<00:02:58.350> I

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
workout felt just way better than I

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:59.360 
workout felt just way better than I
anticipated

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
anticipated

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:01.100 
anticipated
and<00:02:59.580> this<00:03:00.090> brings<00:03:00.300> up<00:03:00.480> an<00:03:00.600> interesting<00:03:00.720> point

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:01.110 
and this brings up an interesting point

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:03.560 
and this brings up an interesting point
I<00:03:01.620> was<00:03:01.769> thinking<00:03:02.100> to<00:03:02.190> myself<00:03:02.239> afterwards<00:03:03.239> and

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:03.570 
I was thinking to myself afterwards and

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:05.960 
I was thinking to myself afterwards and
that's<00:03:04.019> the<00:03:04.260> fact<00:03:04.500> that<00:03:04.650> maybe<00:03:05.070> it<00:03:05.340> felt<00:03:05.610> a<00:03:05.730> lot

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
that's the fact that maybe it felt a lot

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:08.449 
that's the fact that maybe it felt a lot
better<00:03:06.300> because<00:03:06.900> I<00:03:07.200> was<00:03:07.350> working<00:03:08.130> out<00:03:08.250> with

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:08.459 
better because I was working out with

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:10.759 
better because I was working out with
like-minded<00:03:08.760> individuals<00:03:09.390> and<00:03:10.170> just<00:03:10.200> had

00:03:10.759 --> 00:03:10.769 
like-minded individuals and just had

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:12.920 
like-minded individuals and just had
people<00:03:10.950> around<00:03:11.250> me<00:03:11.850> encouraging<00:03:12.510> me<00:03:12.570> and

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930 
people around me encouraging me and

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:14.780 
people around me encouraging me and
that's<00:03:13.560> something<00:03:13.650> that<00:03:14.070> I've<00:03:14.220> never<00:03:14.430> really

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790 
that's something that I've never really

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:16.580 
that's something that I've never really
thought<00:03:15.000> about<00:03:15.060> before<00:03:15.810> because<00:03:15.959> I<00:03:16.140> always

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:16.590 
thought about before because I always

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:18.740 
thought about before because I always
work<00:03:16.829> out<00:03:17.010> alone<00:03:17.400> and<00:03:17.760> it's<00:03:18.329> just<00:03:18.510> what<00:03:18.630> I've

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750 
work out alone and it's just what I've

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:20.479 
work out alone and it's just what I've
always<00:03:18.900> done<00:03:19.320> I've<00:03:19.500> always<00:03:19.769> trained<00:03:20.160> on<00:03:20.340> my

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:20.489 
always done I've always trained on my

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:23.090 
always done I've always trained on my
own<00:03:20.670> schedule<00:03:21.120> and<00:03:21.600> I<00:03:21.930> like<00:03:22.200> the<00:03:22.440> flexibility

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:23.100 
own schedule and I like the flexibility

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:25.460 
own schedule and I like the flexibility
in<00:03:23.280> doing<00:03:23.700> that<00:03:23.880> but<00:03:24.750> it<00:03:24.959> really<00:03:25.170> was

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:25.470 
in doing that but it really was

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:27.530 
in doing that but it really was
interesting<00:03:26.190> the<00:03:26.310> fact<00:03:26.489> that<00:03:26.670> this<00:03:26.940> just<00:03:27.239> went

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:27.540 
interesting the fact that this just went

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:30.110 
interesting the fact that this just went
way<00:03:27.810> better<00:03:28.110> than<00:03:28.350> expected<00:03:28.579> so<00:03:29.579> maybe<00:03:29.880> an

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120 
way better than expected so maybe an

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:32.569 
way better than expected so maybe an
ideal<00:03:30.480> situation<00:03:30.810> for<00:03:31.200> me<00:03:31.680> is<00:03:31.890> training<00:03:32.459> with

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:32.579 
ideal situation for me is training with

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:35.000 
ideal situation for me is training with
other<00:03:32.730> people<00:03:33.269> as<00:03:33.420> you<00:03:33.750> guys<00:03:34.140> know<00:03:34.380> promoting

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010 
other people as you guys know promoting

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:36.800 
other people as you guys know promoting
raw<00:03:35.190> powerlifting<00:03:35.640> is<00:03:36.030> one<00:03:36.269> of<00:03:36.390> the<00:03:36.480> main

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810 
raw powerlifting is one of the main

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:38.539 
raw powerlifting is one of the main
goals<00:03:37.049> of<00:03:37.260> my<00:03:37.410> channel<00:03:37.920> so<00:03:38.280> that's<00:03:38.400> why<00:03:38.519> I

00:03:38.539 --> 00:03:38.549 
goals of my channel so that's why I

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:40.400 
goals of my channel so that's why I
strongly<00:03:38.970> recommend<00:03:39.540> that<00:03:39.600> you<00:03:39.690> subscribe<00:03:39.959> to

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:40.410 
strongly recommend that you subscribe to

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:41.900 
strongly recommend that you subscribe to
Chelsea's<00:03:40.799> channel<00:03:41.160> if<00:03:41.340> you<00:03:41.489> haven't<00:03:41.850> already

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:44.449

into the sport which personally I think

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:48.259 
into the sport which personally I think
would<00:03:46.530> be<00:03:46.560> a<00:03:46.650> great<00:03:47.010> thing<00:03:47.280> I've<00:03:48.030> actually

00:03:48.259 --> 00:03:48.269 
would be a great thing I've actually

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:51.199 
would be a great thing I've actually

bit<00:04:58.960> of<00:04:59.169> deadlifts<00:04:59.710> we<00:05:00.069> didn't<00:05:00.340> have<00:05:00.490> chalk<00:05:00.819> so

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:01.120 
bit of deadlifts we didn't have chalk so

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:03.600 
bit of deadlifts we didn't have chalk so
I<00:05:01.150> only<00:05:01.389> did<00:05:01.629> speed<00:05:01.990> pulls<00:05:02.289> with<00:05:02.470> 495<00:05:03.310> pounds

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:03.610 
I only did speed pulls with 495 pounds

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:06.180 
I only did speed pulls with 495 pounds
and<00:05:04.030> try<00:05:04.449> to<00:05:04.509> pull<00:05:04.750> as<00:05:04.870> fast<00:05:05.229> as<00:05:05.500> possible

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:06.190 
and try to pull as fast as possible

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:08.249 
and try to pull as fast as possible
which<00:05:06.699> is<00:05:06.729> a<00:05:07.000> little<00:05:07.360> bit<00:05:07.479> more<00:05:07.659> difficult<00:05:08.229> to

00:05:08.249 --> 00:05:08.259 
which is a little bit more difficult to

00:05:08.259 --> 00:05:10.529 
which is a little bit more difficult to
do<00:05:08.590> without<00:05:08.979> chalk<00:05:09.340> but<00:05:09.819> on<00:05:09.940> the<00:05:10.030> plus<00:05:10.270> side<00:05:10.509> it

00:05:10.529 --> 00:05:10.539 
do without chalk but on the plus side it

00:05:10.539 --> 00:05:11.909 
do without chalk but on the plus side it
probably<00:05:10.990> helps<00:05:11.229> a<00:05:11.289> little<00:05:11.470> bit<00:05:11.740> with

00:05:11.909 --> 00:05:11.919 
probably helps a little bit with

00:05:11.919 --> 00:05:13.559 
probably helps a little bit with
developing<00:05:12.520> grip<00:05:12.789> strength<00:05:13.180> so<00:05:13.389> there's

00:05:13.559 --> 00:05:13.569 
developing grip strength so there's

00:05:13.569 --> 00:05:15.330
