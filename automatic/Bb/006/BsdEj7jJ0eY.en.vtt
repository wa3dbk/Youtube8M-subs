snake these enhanced soldiers seem to be

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:07.220 
snake these enhanced soldiers seem to be
using<00:00:05.520> some<00:00:05.879> sort<00:00:06.150> of<00:00:06.210> device<00:00:06.600> to<00:00:06.870> cling<00:00:07.200> to

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:07.230 
using some sort of device to cling to

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:09.230 
using some sort of device to cling to
the<00:00:07.440> walls<00:00:07.770> doesn't<00:00:08.670> look<00:00:08.820> like<00:00:08.970> they<00:00:09.120> have

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:09.240 
the walls doesn't look like they have

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.749 
the walls doesn't look like they have
spikes<00:00:09.630> or<00:00:09.900> suction<00:00:10.290> cups<00:00:10.530> this<00:00:11.309> is<00:00:11.429> only<00:00:11.610> a

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:11.759 
spikes or suction cups this is only a

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:13.940 
spikes or suction cups this is only a
guess<00:00:12.090> but<00:00:12.150> I<00:00:12.750> think<00:00:12.870> they're<00:00:13.259> gloves<00:00:13.679> and

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
guess but I think they're gloves and

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:15.709 
guess but I think they're gloves and
boots<00:00:14.250> might<00:00:14.549> have<00:00:14.730> some<00:00:14.940> mechanism<00:00:15.599> that

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
boots might have some mechanism that

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:20.480 
boots might have some mechanism that
employs<00:00:16.139> Van<00:00:16.650> der<00:00:16.949> Waals<00:00:17.190> force<00:00:19.160> it's<00:00:20.160> a<00:00:20.279> type

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
employs Van der Waals force it's a type

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.340 
employs Van der Waals force it's a type
of<00:00:20.670> mutual<00:00:20.939> interaction<00:00:21.900> that<00:00:22.020> occurs

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
of mutual interaction that occurs

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:23.990 
of mutual interaction that occurs
between<00:00:22.560> two<00:00:23.039> electrically<00:00:23.699> neutral
