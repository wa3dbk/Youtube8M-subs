00:00:00.609 --> 00:00:04.850
 informs the other Side Concertmaster by showing us so 

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:10.760
 It makes fun of it because 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:12.779
 although they are present 

00:00:12.779 --> 00:00:14.199
 ten minutes or so 

00:00:14.199 --> 00:00:18.380
 Dell's video on what's in the squad from Lenk's lead Billy Talent 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:21.679
 all around 

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:23.089
 why winner 

00:00:23.089 --> 00:00:24.509
 so if he already visited 

00:00:24.509 --> 00:00:27.649
 is exactly the same thing 

00:00:27.649 --> 00:00:31.599
 For the sunny dry send four wanted to work for one 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.410
 that even the sequence and settlements take place over itself 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.100
 we wanted to play a reduction 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:50.930
 an injured 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:52.940
 a day 10 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:55.940
 and give it a day 

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:04.550
 in the forum instead of her it is more difficult to find the one 

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:07.550
 Albig 2 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:12.290
 not everyone has to help but 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:17.000
 the parents now a mail that I personally like the best 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.080
 is not like in the song percent 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:23.950
 Karl Hofbauer I personally like looking for solutions 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:25.440
 middle aged 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:28.440
 to have hints about it as well as I liked 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:33.310
 Water instead of a legal solution Wilms a personally best 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:35.870
 like 

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:39.220
 that concludes a further-so I would play seven 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:44.460
 and then you can decide for yourself we are playing if he is 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.140
 maybe the semblance SPI 0 2 0 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:48.600
 anyway 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.600
 because designers are ahead 

00:02:24.869 --> 00:02:27.579
 yes damn it 

00:02:27.579 --> 00:02:31.629
 that then one of us proved a last honor and she should not 

00:02:31.629 --> 00:02:33.609
 even only headlights 

00:02:33.609 --> 00:02:36.609
 and then it was already taken leave so 

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:41.459
 the attack that I have now I said the following is cheery 

00:02:42.749 --> 00:02:46.129
 Holzer 

00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:47.859
 was for us 

00:02:47.859 --> 00:02:49.309
 Coester 

00:02:49.309 --> 00:02:52.769
 Youngster 

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:54.699
 the German 

00:02:54.699 --> 00:02:56.309
 in fact 

00:02:56.309 --> 00:02:59.309
 Trunzer 

00:03:02.659 --> 00:03:03.849
 although it is there 

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:06.849
 principle 

00:03:11.009 --> 00:03:13.209
 cheap oil so difficult to say 

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:17.009
 the NDR at the expiration few new issue c and g 

00:03:17.649 --> 00:03:20.579
 then the whole thing stays the same 

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:23.579
 that does not change anything 

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:29.369
 more than ten songs together 

00:03:29.369 --> 00:03:32.129
 dare to help you 

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:35.529
 nla-round incidents should be saved and have a nice day 

00:03:37.289 --> 00:03:39.949
 and not to be missed 

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:41.069
 under 

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:41.849
 the TuS east
