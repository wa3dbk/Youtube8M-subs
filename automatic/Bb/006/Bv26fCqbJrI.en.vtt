00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
that this is talking about a form of

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.010 
that this is talking about a form of
idolatry<00:01:22.320> where<00:01:22.950> a<00:01:23.009> tree<00:01:23.580> is<00:01:23.729> cut<00:01:23.820> but<00:01:24.270> then<00:01:24.479> it

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
is cut into a totem or an idol and that

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:32.179 
is cut into a totem or an idol and that
the<00:01:29.369> axe<00:01:29.640> is<00:01:30.090> actually<00:01:30.450> a<00:01:30.479> skilled<00:01:31.470> artisan

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
the axe is actually a skilled artisan

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.880 
the axe is actually a skilled artisan
carver<00:01:33.090> that<00:01:33.780> makes<00:01:34.200> this<00:01:34.409> into<00:01:34.680> something

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
carver that makes this into something

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.460 
carver that makes this into something
different<00:01:35.729> from<00:01:36.119> and<00:01:36.360> therefore<00:01:36.990> cannot<00:01:37.320> be

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
different from and therefore cannot be

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:38.960 
different from and therefore cannot be
applied<00:01:37.650> to<00:01:37.950> the<00:01:38.040> idea<00:01:38.340> of<00:01:38.520> a<00:01:38.579> modern

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970

Christmas tree

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.230 
Christmas tree
but<00:01:40.259> I<00:01:40.290> think<00:01:40.409> that<00:01:40.770> the<00:01:41.130> fact<00:01:41.369> that<00:01:41.460> Jeremiah

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
but I think that the fact that Jeremiah

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.899 
but I think that the fact that Jeremiah
here<00:01:42.479> is<00:01:42.540> talking<00:01:42.780> about<00:01:43.700> avoiding<00:01:44.700> the

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
here is talking about avoiding the

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:47.330 
here is talking about avoiding the
practices<00:01:45.509> of<00:01:45.540> the<00:01:45.689> heathen<00:01:46.170> that<00:01:46.770> then

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
practices of the heathen that then

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.440 
practices of the heathen that then
become<00:01:48.110> idolatry<00:01:49.110> and<00:01:49.430> a<00:01:50.430> part<00:01:51.000> of<00:01:51.060> worship

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
become idolatry and a part of worship
