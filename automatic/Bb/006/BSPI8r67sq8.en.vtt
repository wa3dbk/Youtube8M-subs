00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:09.650
 here as I said when I click on 

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:13.730
 any tool I'm using that 

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:16.009
 here I have not felt that it will show in the 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:17.810
 I'm staying so I think it's very cool 

00:00:16.009 --> 00:00:21.110
 This is because for example when I do 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:23.270
 a video appears that is causing 

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:25.220
 sang by clicking and I find it interesting 

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:28.610
 I like to see this in the video of the two 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:33.920
 People like me said the little hand I 

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:36.320
 wear on the shirt all the time and here the 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:41.540
 button that brings the option of the 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:44.960
 brushes that are selecting the brush and 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:46.750
 if I then select the angle it 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:49.540
 undo 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:52.400
 So all these buttons that I have 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:55.460
 speaking now are the ones who are 

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:59.300
 set here on my left side 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:00.680
 even okay I will not use anything that is 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:02.720
 on my keyboard 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:11.510
 What I have here to drop my pen 

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:21.040
 to use it here I have a brush and 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:21.040
 rubber thinks 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:32.820
 and who else I have here the increase 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:51.420
 brush in case someone rubber that the 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:54.690
 increase in sky and decrease sky and has 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:56.940
 andor that undoes 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:02:00.660
 I think it only goes up to a certain 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:02.640
 But it 's enough point for me not to 

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:08.670
 I know this does not settle 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:10.709
 it has a zum I have tool that 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:13.530
 decreases 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:15.959
 good now tool than me else 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:19.080
 everyone is the option that is right in the 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:22.910
 middle of the circle use the torque to 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:22.910
 show why I use both 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:47.110
 it's the following let's say I'm 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:51.730
 painting a thing of two colors and I 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:54.849
 I want to mix these two colors to make a 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:58.840
 gradient the ocean it serves for example 

00:02:54.849 --> 00:03:00.099
 painting came from that opaque was not much 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:02.799
 next 

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:05.349
 I want more results click here in blue 

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:12.220
 He catches color. 

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:16.870
 I as he calls the bill is a 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:18.760
 drops that picks up color for me and stays 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:21.549
 much easier than it is small 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:23.890
 keyboard or click here 

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:26.370
 somewhere where no I come here 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:29.739
 or click here 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:36.489
 so what I would normally do I do 

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:43.079
 No, it's a question, and heaven is and I'm going to 

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:48.280
 see no now has very blue and green 

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:53.799
 Blue and blue 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:56.260
 and so on until you do not know 

00:03:53.799 --> 00:03:59.829
 where is the difference where one starts 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:00.849
 But another understood why this 

00:03:59.829 --> 00:04:04.810
 it's very good 

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:07.299
 I love this tool your use of the type 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:12.609
 if you had an accountant how many times 

00:04:07.299 --> 00:04:14.560
 I talked to her and she would give the infinite and 

00:04:12.609 --> 00:04:20.829
 hope you like it 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:23.519
 I hope it helped to leave 

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:23.519
 close to family 

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:29.889
 If you have any question I 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:32.590
 I do not remember anything else that I can 

00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:34.090
 talk at that moment ask us 

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:38.410
 comments 

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:41.680
 and if you want to see a tutorial 

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:44.020
 something about how to use some other 

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:46.330
 tool I'm not an expert on you 

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:48.760
 photoshop I'm not very good and 

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:53.289
 photoshop person that I'm best at 

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:55.240
 q painting does not program itself 

00:04:53.289 --> 00:04:58.059
 Anything I can to help 

00:04:55.240 --> 00:05:00.999
 just leave me a question is if you write to us 

00:04:58.059 --> 00:05:06.089
 comments would be the answer 

00:05:00.999 --> 00:05:06.089
 Thank you and until the next video such
