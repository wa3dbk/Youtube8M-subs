getting a little one down of all the

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.740 
getting a little one down of all the
futures<00:00:12.480> so<00:00:12.809> what<00:00:13.469> exactly<00:00:14.210> does<00:00:15.210> it<00:00:15.269> do<00:00:15.509> and

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
futures so what exactly does it do and

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.290 
futures so what exactly does it do and
how<00:00:15.870> different<00:00:16.379> is<00:00:16.470> it<00:00:16.740> from<00:00:16.859> other<00:00:17.300> galaxy

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
how different is it from other galaxy

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.800 
how different is it from other galaxy
tab<00:00:18.480> devices<00:00:18.900> that<00:00:18.960> have<00:00:19.050> been<00:00:19.170> announced

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:20.810 
tab devices that have been announced

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:24.200 
tab devices that have been announced
well<00:00:21.810> inside<00:00:22.710> it's<00:00:23.070> almost<00:00:23.550> exactly<00:00:24.000> the<00:00:24.119> same

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
well inside it's almost exactly the same

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.019 
well inside it's almost exactly the same
machine<00:00:24.720> as<00:00:24.750> the<00:00:24.990> galaxy<00:00:25.410> tab<00:00:25.619> 10.1<00:00:25.890> so<00:00:26.820> you're

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
machine as the galaxy tab 10.1 so you're

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:28.700 
machine as the galaxy tab 10.1 so you're
getting<00:00:27.269> all<00:00:27.390> the<00:00:27.480> power<00:00:27.660> of<00:00:27.930> the<00:00:28.019> galaxy<00:00:28.470> tab

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
getting all the power of the galaxy tab

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.009 
getting all the power of the galaxy tab
you've<00:00:29.490> got<00:00:29.670> the<00:00:29.820> TouchWiz<00:00:30.300> interface<00:00:30.330> here

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
you've got the TouchWiz interface here

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:31.970 
you've got the TouchWiz interface here
which<00:00:31.230> are<00:00:31.320> some<00:00:31.529> nice<00:00:31.679> interface

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
which are some nice interface

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.950 
which are some nice interface

honeycomb for instance you get our live
panel<00:00:36.660> widgets<00:00:37.110> the<00:00:37.649> widgets<00:00:37.980> fit<00:00:38.160> a<00:00:38.190> little

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
panel widgets the widgets fit a little

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.100 
panel widgets the widgets fit a little
bit<00:00:38.550> more<00:00:38.730> closely<00:00:39.059> together<00:00:39.390> give<00:00:39.780> a<00:00:39.809> kind<00:00:40.050> of

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
bit more closely together give a kind of

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.160 
bit more closely together give a kind of
magazine<00:00:40.649> look<00:00:41.010> you<00:00:41.790> can<00:00:41.940> also<00:00:42.059> resize<00:00:42.719> a<00:00:42.750> lot

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
magazine look you can also resize a lot

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:44.750 
magazine look you can also resize a lot
of<00:00:43.290> the<00:00:43.410> widgets<00:00:43.739> so<00:00:43.890> that<00:00:44.070> you<00:00:44.489> can<00:00:44.610> organize

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
of the widgets so that you can organize

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.340 
of the widgets so that you can organize
them<00:00:45.149> and<00:00:45.270> fit<00:00:45.450> them<00:00:45.480> exactly<00:00:45.870> how<00:00:46.020> you<00:00:46.140> like

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
them and fit them exactly how you like

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.100 
them and fit them exactly how you like
right<00:00:47.340> and<00:00:47.670> it's<00:00:47.789> that's<00:00:48.000> that's<00:00:48.629> very

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
right and it's that's that's very

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.910 
right and it's that's that's very
similar<00:00:49.289> to<00:00:49.469> the<00:00:50.270> previous<00:00:51.270> the<00:00:51.780> 10.1<00:00:52.320> shrimp

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
similar to the previous the 10.1 shrimp

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.740 
similar to the previous the 10.1 shrimp
exactly<00:00:53.550> it's<00:00:53.699> it's<00:00:54.030> almost<00:00:54.210> exactly<00:00:54.360> the

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
exactly it's it's almost exactly the

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.569 
exactly it's it's almost exactly the
same<00:00:54.840> interface<00:00:55.320> you're<00:00:56.070> going<00:00:56.190> to<00:00:56.250> find<00:00:56.399> on

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
same interface you're going to find on

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.930 
same interface you're going to find on
the<00:00:56.670> 10.1<00:00:57.210> inch<00:00:57.390> tab<00:00:57.660> okay<00:00:58.730> are<00:00:59.730> there<00:00:59.879> any

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
the 10.1 inch tab okay are there any

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.670 
the 10.1 inch tab okay are there any
differences<00:01:00.359> between<00:01:00.989> the<00:01:01.170> two<00:01:01.230> besides<00:01:01.620> the

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
differences between the two besides the

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:02.910 
differences between the two besides the
screen

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:02.920 
screen

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:05.100 
screen
I<00:01:02.980> guess<00:01:03.640> this<00:01:03.730> one<00:01:03.879> is<00:01:03.969> 8.9<00:01:04.449> inches<00:01:04.809> sure

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:05.110 
I guess this one is 8.9 inches sure

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:06.810 
I guess this one is 8.9 inches sure
you'll<00:01:05.439> probably<00:01:05.799> put<00:01:06.040> a<00:01:06.070> smaller<00:01:06.400> battery

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:06.820 
you'll probably put a smaller battery

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:09.450 
you'll probably put a smaller battery
inside<00:01:07.150> of<00:01:07.360> the<00:01:07.479> 8.9<00:01:08.049> but<00:01:08.380> you'll<00:01:08.560> get<00:01:08.740> you'll

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:09.460 
inside of the 8.9 but you'll get you'll

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:11.070 
inside of the 8.9 but you'll get you'll
still<00:01:09.670> get<00:01:09.759> substantial<00:01:10.360> battery<00:01:10.689> life<00:01:10.869> out

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:11.080 
still get substantial battery life out

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:12.810 
still get substantial battery life out
of<00:01:11.110> it<00:01:11.320> especially<00:01:12.189> because<00:01:12.280> we<00:01:12.430> see<00:01:12.580> this<00:01:12.729> is

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:12.820 
of it especially because we see this is

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:14.850 
of it especially because we see this is
more<00:01:13.000> of<00:01:13.060> a<00:01:13.180> reading<00:01:13.540> device<00:01:13.840> right<00:01:14.439> oh<00:01:14.500> I<00:01:14.590> can

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:14.860 
more of a reading device right oh I can

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:18.149 
more of a reading device right oh I can
really<00:01:14.890> like<00:01:15.520> in<00:01:15.640> one<00:01:15.850> hand<00:01:16.149> 8.9<00:01:16.990> yeah<00:01:17.680> yeah

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:18.159 
really like in one hand 8.9 yeah yeah

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:21.810 
really like in one hand 8.9 yeah yeah
I've<00:01:18.880> small<00:01:19.539> hands<00:01:19.899> so<00:01:20.190> it's<00:01:21.190> much<00:01:21.490> easier<00:01:21.520> for

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:21.820 
I've small hands so it's much easier for

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:23.639 
I've small hands so it's much easier for
