00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
you get knives in the back then you get

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:04.850 
you get knives in the back then you get
humiliated<00:02:03.360> which<00:02:04.200> means<00:02:04.439> it<00:02:04.560> demote<00:02:04.829> you

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
humiliated which means it demote you

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.319

00:02:32.259 --> 00:02:32.269 
step down from waddle over to but it's

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:33.910 
step down from waddle over to but it's
kind<00:02:32.510> of<00:02:32.540> refreshing<00:02:32.690> because<00:02:33.260> you<00:02:33.530> can<00:02:33.680> tell

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:33.920

00:02:36.509 --> 00:02:36.519 
it's cut that world at war field but

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:38.800 
it's cut that world at war field but
it's<00:02:37.519> it's<00:02:37.640> kind<00:02:38.030> of<00:02:38.060> refreshing<00:02:38.180> kind<00:02:38.720> of

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:38.810 
it's it's kind of refreshing kind of

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:40.300 
it's it's kind of refreshing kind of
getting<00:02:38.989> off<00:02:39.170> the<00:02:39.379> kind<00:02:39.860> of<00:02:39.920> getting<00:02:40.069> off<00:02:40.190> the

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
getting off the kind of getting off the

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:42.729 
getting off the kind of getting off the
realism<00:02:40.700> bench<00:02:41.330> a<00:02:41.480> little<00:02:41.599> bit<00:02:41.870> is<00:02:42.260> it<00:02:42.650> was

00:02:42.729 --> 00:02:42.739 
realism bench a little bit is it was

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:44.710 
realism bench a little bit is it was
kind<00:02:42.950> of<00:02:42.980> getting<00:02:43.099> a<00:02:43.220> real<00:02:43.519> kind<00:02:43.760> of<00:02:43.940> a<00:02:44.180> little

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:44.720 
kind of getting a real kind of a little

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:48.550 
kind of getting a real kind of a little
dull<00:02:45.519> for<00:02:46.519> a<00:02:46.610> while<00:02:46.790> with<00:02:47.750> the<00:02:47.780> modern<00:02:48.380> warfare

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:48.560 
dull for a while with the modern warfare

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:51.250 
dull for a while with the modern warfare
2<00:02:48.799> but<00:02:49.549> other<00:02:50.420> than<00:02:50.540> that<00:02:50.630> aside<00:02:51.079> from<00:02:51.140> the

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:51.260 
2 but other than that aside from the

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.289 
2 but other than that aside from the
graphics<00:02:51.680> the<00:02:52.160> graphics<00:02:52.430> do<00:02:52.549> look<00:02:52.730> great<00:02:52.849> they

00:02:53.289 --> 00:02:53.299 
graphics the graphics do look great they

00:02:53.299 --> 00:02:54.699 
graphics the graphics do look great they
are<00:02:53.480> good<00:02:53.720> they're<00:02:53.900> just<00:02:54.079> kind<00:02:54.380> of<00:02:54.410> a<00:02:54.500> step

00:02:54.699 --> 00:02:54.709 
are good they're just kind of a step

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:56.470 
are good they're just kind of a step
down<00:02:54.860> from<00:02:54.920> the<00:02:55.459> realism<00:02:55.760> of<00:02:56.060> modern<00:02:56.360> warfare

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:56.480 
down from the realism of modern warfare

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:00.880 
down from the realism of modern warfare
2<00:02:56.780> so<00:02:57.620> basically<00:02:58.360> we're<00:02:59.360> looking<00:02:59.450> at<00:02:59.780> is<00:03:00.079> the

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:00.890 
2 so basically we're looking at is the

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:02.949 
2 so basically we're looking at is the
sound<00:03:01.099> design<00:03:01.340> is<00:03:01.370> great<00:03:01.760> the<00:03:02.090> guns<00:03:02.480> all<00:03:02.690> sound

00:03:02.949 --> 00:03:02.959 
sound design is great the guns all sound

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:06.970 
sound design is great the guns all sound
real<00:03:03.200> good<00:03:04.569> that's<00:03:05.569> pretty<00:03:06.049> much<00:03:06.200> I<00:03:06.470> like<00:03:06.860> the

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:06.980 
real good that's pretty much I like the

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:10.569 
real good that's pretty much I like the
game<00:03:07.150> real<00:03:08.150> fun<00:03:08.360> to<00:03:08.480> play<00:03:08.799> uh<00:03:09.799> what<00:03:10.250> else<00:03:10.370> is<00:03:10.549> uh

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:10.579 
game real fun to play uh what else is uh

00:03:10.579 --> 00:03:13.000 
game real fun to play uh what else is uh
did<00:03:11.360> I<00:03:11.420> want<00:03:11.569> to<00:03:11.660> mention<00:03:11.810> oh<00:03:12.170> right<00:03:12.650> the<00:03:12.829> hit

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:13.010 
did I want to mention oh right the hit

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:15.370 
did I want to mention oh right the hit
detection<00:03:13.130> hit<00:03:13.639> detection<00:03:13.760> can<00:03:14.450> be<00:03:14.480> terrible

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:15.380 
detection hit detection can be terrible

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:16.720 
detection hit detection can be terrible
that<00:03:15.680> basically<00:03:15.889> means<00:03:16.310> when<00:03:16.430> you<00:03:16.519> fired

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:16.730 
that basically means when you fired

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:20.710 
that basically means when you fired
somebody<00:03:17.000> a<00:03:18.280> couple<00:03:19.280> times<00:03:19.489> out<00:03:19.609> of<00:03:19.639> 10<00:03:19.910> if<00:03:20.209> you

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:20.720 
somebody a couple times out of 10 if you

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:22.629 
somebody a couple times out of 10 if you
won't<00:03:20.840> get<00:03:21.049> any<00:03:21.170> hit<00:03:21.290> markers<00:03:21.650> and<00:03:21.889> that's<00:03:22.549> a

00:03:22.629 --> 00:03:22.639 
won't get any hit markers and that's a

00:03:22.639 --> 00:03:24.670 
won't get any hit markers and that's a
shame<00:03:22.880> well<00:03:23.810> the<00:03:23.930> war<00:03:24.109> suffered<00:03:24.530> from

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:24.680 
shame well the war suffered from

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:26.890 
shame well the war suffered from
problems<00:03:25.069> like<00:03:25.190> this<00:03:25.400> called<00:03:26.209> lady<00:03:26.389> for<00:03:26.600> model

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:26.900 
problems like this called lady for model

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:29.410 
problems like this called lady for model
refer<00:03:27.079> to<00:03:27.290> didn't<00:03:28.190> really<00:03:28.609> they<00:03:29.060> may<00:03:29.180> have<00:03:29.299> had

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:29.420 
refer to didn't really they may have had

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:31.090 
refer to didn't really they may have had
minor<00:03:29.660> ones<00:03:29.930> but<00:03:30.109> while<00:03:30.319> the<00:03:30.440> war<00:03:30.650> really<00:03:30.889> had

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:31.100 
minor ones but while the war really had

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:34.210 
minor ones but while the war really had
a<00:03:31.130> worse<00:03:31.819> and<00:03:32.120> because<00:03:32.660> this<00:03:32.870> is<00:03:33.019> a<00:03:33.220> an

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:34.220 
a worse and because this is a an

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:35.860 
a worse and because this is a an
advanced<00:03:34.880> version<00:03:34.910> of<00:03:35.239> the<00:03:35.329> world<00:03:35.540> of<00:03:35.690> war

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:35.870 
advanced version of the world of war

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:37.599 
advanced version of the world of war
engine<00:03:36.230> I<00:03:36.380> can<00:03:36.620> see<00:03:36.829> where<00:03:37.069> the<00:03:37.340> hit<00:03:37.489> detection

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:37.609 
engine I can see where the hit detection

00:03:37.609 --> 00:03:39.910 
engine I can see where the hit detection
problems<00:03:38.569> are<00:03:38.690> coming<00:03:38.900> from<00:03:38.989> some<00:03:39.530> of<00:03:39.620> you<00:03:39.739> who

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:39.920 
problems are coming from some of you who

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:41.590 
problems are coming from some of you who
played<00:03:40.190> counterstrike<00:03:40.549> source<00:03:40.819> so<00:03:41.480> those

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:41.600
