00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:45.780 
all the mucus had totally disappeared I

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:48.530 
all the mucus had totally disappeared I
did<00:03:46.230> have<00:03:46.440> some<00:03:46.680> improvement<00:03:47.310> when<00:03:47.910> I<00:03:47.940> last

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:48.540 
did have some improvement when I last

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:53.599 
did have some improvement when I last
spoke<00:03:48.690> with<00:03:49.200> you<00:03:49.440> and<00:03:50.239> but<00:03:51.239> since<00:03:52.079> then<00:03:52.410> I<00:03:52.739> went

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:53.609 
spoke with you and but since then I went

00:03:53.609 --> 00:03:55.580 
spoke with you and but since then I went
through<00:03:53.700> a<00:03:54.239> little<00:03:54.600> bit<00:03:54.720> of<00:03:54.870> a<00:03:54.989> healing

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:55.590 
through a little bit of a healing

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:58.670 
through a little bit of a healing
process<00:03:55.620> where<00:03:56.519> things<00:03:57.510> weren't<00:03:57.870> quite<00:03:58.260> what

00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:58.680 
process where things weren't quite what

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:01.220 
process where things weren't quite what
I<00:03:58.980> thought<00:03:59.430> they<00:03:59.609> should<00:03:59.790> have<00:03:59.820> been<00:03:59.989> but<00:04:00.989> I've

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:13.500 
and just found that that every session I

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:16.790 
and just found that that every session I
went<00:06:13.680> to<00:06:13.830> I<00:06:13.860> had<00:06:14.790> greater<00:06:15.120> vitality<00:06:15.720> I<00:06:16.169> felt

better<00:06:16.980> I<00:06:17.220> felt<00:06:17.550> more<00:06:17.760> alive

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:18.540
