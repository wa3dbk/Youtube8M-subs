00:00:20.489 --> 00:00:23.489

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:26.439
 the 

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:27.890
 one of them 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:29.360
 go to school 

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:31.119
 but then for 

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:34.119
 as far as the sea and development are concerned 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:38.850
 but for you 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.990
 m at the unveiling 

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:43.990

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:52.610
 montebourg 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:55.610
 my 

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:01.000
 it's done 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.010
 if if me 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:05.239
 rens 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:08.410
 2 

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:10.080
 so is the navy 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:10.950
 a voice 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.150
 of the 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.870
 so I called my reaction 

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:17.500
 to do it there is 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:20.810
 this american time magazine 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:24.050
 the group leaves 

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:27.050
 but for the moment this is an important announcement 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:29.840
 so here 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.120
 swimming world movies 

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:33.609
 So it is necessary 

00:01:33.609 --> 00:01:34.810
 he lives since 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:36.990
 the night promised to be long 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.990

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:44.300
 mum 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:47.350
 he was talking about giving him the content 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:50.350
 no pot 

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:54.440
 so so sure 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:57.800
 fifi 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:01.290
 fillon 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.680
 that is why 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:06.680
 how could it be otherwise? 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:11.139
 indeed 

00:02:11.139 --> 00:02:11.730
