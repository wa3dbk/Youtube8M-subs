why to use puffy paint is better is

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:44.089 
why to use puffy paint is better is
because<00:04:42.060> I<00:04:42.539> guess<00:04:43.139> puffy<00:04:43.380> paint<00:04:43.710> will<00:04:43.860> really

00:04:44.089 --> 00:04:44.099 
because I guess puffy paint will really

00:04:44.099 --> 00:04:48.260 
because I guess puffy paint will really
crack<00:04:44.990> but<00:04:45.990> I<00:04:46.259> click<00:04:46.740> peal<00:04:47.039> will<00:04:47.280> crack<00:04:47.699> after

crack but I click peal will crack after

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:51.860 
crack but I click peal will crack after

some time if you squish it too much

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:54.529 
some time if you squish it too much
