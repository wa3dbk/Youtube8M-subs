that this is a different sized nut than
the<00:00:27.510> factory<00:00:27.930> replacement<00:00:28.050> I<00:00:28.470> don't<00:00:28.619> know<00:00:28.680> I

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740

whole thing that way you get a new
pulley<00:00:34.110> here<00:00:34.440> and<00:00:34.649> a<00:00:35.550> new<00:00:35.700> assembly<00:00:36.210> there

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
pulley here and a new assembly there

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
you will find are on that bolt right

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.819 
you will find are on that bolt right
there<00:00:45.440> if<00:00:46.440> you<00:00:46.620> can<00:00:46.770> see<00:00:47.010> it<00:00:48.469> that<00:00:49.469> bolts

sticking out on the end the tensioner
you<00:00:51.809> actually<00:00:52.110> have<00:00:52.230> to<00:00:52.320> jack<00:00:52.649> the<00:00:52.860> motor<00:00:53.070> up

00:00:53.799 --> 00:00:53.809 
you actually have to jack the motor up

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:56.119 
you actually have to jack the motor up
after<00:00:54.809> removing<00:00:55.170> all<00:00:55.320> this<00:00:55.530> stuff<00:00:55.800> over<00:00:56.100> here

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
you can see this as a piece of the motor

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.510 
you can see this as a piece of the motor
and<00:00:59.820> then<00:00:59.879> go<00:01:00.030> back<00:01:00.210> up<00:01:00.390> here<00:01:00.420> like<00:01:00.690> this<00:01:01.520> and

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:16.000 
you're going to need a tensioner when

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.349 
you're going to need a tensioner when
you<00:04:16.090> do<00:04:16.239> that<00:04:16.479> eventually<00:04:17.760> the<00:04:18.760> alternator

00:04:19.349 --> 00:04:19.359 
you do that eventually the alternator

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:20.759 
you do that eventually the alternator
that<00:04:19.540> comes<00:04:19.810> from<00:04:19.930> the<00:04:20.019> factory<00:04:20.350> eventually

00:04:20.759 --> 00:04:20.769 
that comes from the factory eventually

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:23.340 
that comes from the factory eventually
gets<00:04:20.889> all<00:04:21.010> buzzy<00:04:21.549> and<00:04:21.990> causes<00:04:22.990> all<00:04:23.139> your

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:23.350 
gets all buzzy and causes all your

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:27.090 
gets all buzzy and causes all your
sensors<00:04:23.830> to<00:04:24.370> act<00:04:24.580> all<00:04:24.790> funny<00:04:25.260> so<00:04:26.260> get<00:04:26.830> a<00:04:26.860> real

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:27.100 
sensors to act all funny so get a real

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:31.530 
sensors to act all funny so get a real
quiet<00:04:27.430> 6-pole<00:04:28.389> awesome<00:04:29.290> alternator<00:04:29.830> and<00:04:30.540> and

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:31.540 
quiet 6-pole awesome alternator and and

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:33.180 
quiet 6-pole awesome alternator and and
then<00:04:31.720> suddenly<00:04:31.960> it<00:04:32.229> will<00:04:32.320> run<00:04:32.500> limb<00:04:32.680> perfectly

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:33.190 
then suddenly it will run limb perfectly

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:36.870 
then suddenly it will run limb perfectly
