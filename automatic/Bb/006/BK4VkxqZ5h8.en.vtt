what I think about his costume in this
movie<00:03:06.670> nice<00:03:07.660> it's<00:03:08.110> the<00:03:08.680> costume<00:03:09.160> in<00:03:09.370> terms

00:03:09.539 --> 00:03:09.549

like<00:03:09.820> just<00:03:10.150> the<00:03:10.269> costume<00:03:10.720> not<00:03:10.930> necessarily

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:11.380 
like just the costume not necessarily

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:13.100 
like just the costume not necessarily
like<00:03:11.440> him<00:03:11.860> as<00:03:12.070> a

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:13.110 
like him as a

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:15.080 
like him as a
you<00:03:13.290> know<00:03:13.410> the<00:03:13.590> effects<00:03:14.010> and<00:03:14.220> stuff<00:03:14.280> but<00:03:14.850> just

00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:06.420 
because I really want to get either that

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:08.510 
because I really want to get either that
or<00:06:06.630> like<00:06:06.990> my<00:06:07.200> 43<00:06:07.680> if<00:06:07.800> I<00:06:07.890> can't<00:06:08.130> get<00:06:08.250> one<00:06:08.400> before

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:08.520 
or like my 43 if I can't get one before

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:10.730 
or like my 43 if I can't get one before
the<00:06:08.970> baltimore<00:06:09.420> comic-con<00:06:09.600> I<00:06:10.020> want<00:06:10.560> to<00:06:10.620> get

00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:10.740 
the baltimore comic-con I want to get

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:13.190 
the baltimore comic-con I want to get
Stanley<00:06:11.010> to<00:06:11.250> sign<00:06:11.430> something<00:06:11.730> of<00:06:12.000> mine<00:06:12.150> and<00:06:12.330> I

00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:13.200 
Stanley to sign something of mine and I

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:14.270 
Stanley to sign something of mine and I
think<00:06:13.380> that's<00:06:13.500> probably<00:06:13.680> one<00:06:13.950> of<00:06:13.980> the<00:06:14.130> better

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:14.280 
think that's probably one of the better

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:16.070 
think that's probably one of the better
items<00:06:14.580> because<00:06:15.060> I've<00:06:15.270> always<00:06:15.570> liked<00:06:15.780> a<00:06:15.870> rhino

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:16.080 
items because I've always liked a rhino

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:20.120 
items because I've always liked a rhino
and<00:06:17.630> you<00:06:18.630> know<00:06:18.720> it'd<00:06:19.530> be<00:06:19.590> cool<00:06:19.890> to<00:06:19.920> have

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:20.130 
and you know it'd be cool to have

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:23.120 
and you know it'd be cool to have
Stanley<00:06:20.400> sign<00:06:20.700> that<00:06:20.880> you<00:06:20.970> know<00:06:21.060> so<00:06:21.800> I'm<00:06:22.800> hoping

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:23.130 
Stanley sign that you know so I'm hoping

00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:24.860 
Stanley sign that you know so I'm hoping
that<00:06:23.190> I<00:06:23.400> can<00:06:23.520> get<00:06:23.820> one<00:06:24.330> of<00:06:24.360> those<00:06:24.480> two<00:06:24.720> things

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:24.870 
that I can get one of those two things

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:26.840 
that I can get one of those two things
signed<00:06:25.170> I<00:06:25.440> have<00:06:26.010> other<00:06:26.220> things<00:06:26.310> that<00:06:26.610> might<00:06:26.700> be

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:26.850 
signed I have other things that might be

00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:29.450 
signed I have other things that might be
a<00:06:27.360> better<00:06:27.930> idea<00:06:28.080> to<00:06:28.530> get<00:06:28.680> signed<00:06:28.980> than<00:06:29.280> like

00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:29.460 
a better idea to get signed than like

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:30.860 
a better idea to get signed than like
maybe<00:06:29.940> a<00:06:30.030> first<00:06:30.240> appearance<00:06:30.360> of<00:06:30.600> the<00:06:30.660> rhino

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:30.870 
maybe a first appearance of the rhino

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:33.740 
maybe a first appearance of the rhino
and<00:06:31.460> just<00:06:32.460> in<00:06:32.580> terms<00:06:32.700> of<00:06:32.910> like<00:06:33.120> what<00:06:33.570> would<00:06:33.630> be

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:33.750 
and just in terms of like what would be

00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:37.250 
and just in terms of like what would be
more<00:06:33.870> valuable<00:06:34.550> but<00:06:35.550> i<00:06:35.990> don't<00:06:36.990> know<00:06:37.050> i<00:06:37.080> think

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:37.260 
more valuable but i don't know i think

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:39.260 
more valuable but i don't know i think
they<00:06:37.830> Frost<00:06:38.100> it's<00:06:38.430> more<00:06:38.610> important<00:06:39.000> to<00:06:39.060> get

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:39.270 
they Frost it's more important to get

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:40.550 
they Frost it's more important to get
something<00:06:39.600> that's<00:06:39.720> going<00:06:39.870> to<00:06:39.960> mean<00:06:40.110> something

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:40.560 
something that's going to mean something

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:42.470 
something that's going to mean something
to<00:06:40.590> me<00:06:40.740> then<00:06:41.610> something<00:06:41.880> that's<00:06:42.150> just<00:06:42.240> going

00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:42.480 
to me then something that's just going

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:44.720 
to me then something that's just going
to<00:06:42.570> be<00:06:42.600> worth<00:06:43.230> something<00:06:43.770> because<00:06:44.340> i<00:06:44.610> have

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:44.730 
to be worth something because i have

00:06:44.730 --> 00:06:46.490 
to be worth something because i have
like<00:06:44.910> first<00:06:45.180> parents<00:06:45.480> of<00:06:45.570> norman<00:06:45.930> osborn<00:06:46.050> not

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:48.030 
necessarily the Green Goblin but just

00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:49.940 
necessarily the Green Goblin but just
when<00:06:48.210> Norman<00:06:49.110> Osborn<00:06:49.470> has<00:06:49.530> put<00:06:49.680> into<00:06:49.860> the
