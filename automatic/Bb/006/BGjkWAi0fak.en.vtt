I'm<00:00:20.950> Chris<00:00:21.490> Stevens<00:00:21.790> from<00:00:22.180> New<00:00:22.330> Richmond

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:22.630 
I'm Chris Stevens from New Richmond

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:28.630 
I'm Chris Stevens from New Richmond
Wisconsin<00:00:23.200> and<00:00:23.350> I'm<00:00:23.470> a<00:00:23.560> giant<00:00:23.890> pumpkin<00:00:24.250> drawer

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:28.640 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:31.599 

yeah<00:00:29.570> we<00:00:29.750> use<00:00:29.900> the<00:00:30.140> Michaels<00:00:30.619> from<00:00:30.800> RTI<00:00:31.160> and

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:31.609 
yeah we use the Michaels from RTI and

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:34.710 
yeah we use the Michaels from RTI and
it's<00:00:32.149> a<00:00:32.360> it's<00:00:32.840> a<00:00:33.079> mycorrhiza<00:00:33.620> lungi<00:00:34.430> and

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:34.720 
it's a it's a mycorrhiza lungi and

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:36.790 
it's a it's a mycorrhiza lungi and
basically<00:00:35.720> what<00:00:35.899> it<00:00:35.960> does<00:00:36.050> is<00:00:36.320> attaches

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:36.800 
basically what it does is attaches

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:38.650 
basically what it does is attaches
itself<00:00:36.949> to<00:00:37.220> the<00:00:37.430> root<00:00:37.610> and<00:00:37.790> grows<00:00:38.120> within<00:00:38.420> the

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:38.660 
itself to the root and grows within the

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:40.810 
itself to the root and grows within the
root<00:00:38.809> and<00:00:38.840> it<00:00:39.530> effectively<00:00:40.040> increases<00:00:40.699> your

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:40.820 
root and it effectively increases your

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:43.030 
root and it effectively increases your
root<00:00:41.059> system<00:00:41.540> I<00:00:41.899> don't<00:00:42.649> know<00:00:42.710> if<00:00:42.829> it's<00:00:42.949> a

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:43.040 
root system I don't know if it's a

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:45.009 
root system I don't know if it's a
hundred<00:00:43.220> fold<00:00:43.670> it's<00:00:44.180> a<00:00:44.300> dramatic<00:00:44.839> increase

00:00:45.009 --> 00:00:45.019 
hundred fold it's a dramatic increase

00:00:45.019 --> 00:00:48.579 
hundred fold it's a dramatic increase
and<00:00:45.530> it<00:00:46.160> just<00:00:46.339> allows<00:00:46.640> the<00:00:46.850> plant<00:00:47.030> to<00:00:47.410> take<00:00:48.410> in

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:48.589 
and it just allows the plant to take in

00:00:48.589 --> 00:00:50.020 
and it just allows the plant to take in
many<00:00:48.800> more<00:00:49.010> nutrients<00:00:49.610> that<00:00:49.730> it<00:00:49.850> could

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:50.030 
many more nutrients that it could

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:53.290 
many more nutrients that it could
without<00:00:50.500> we<00:00:51.500> use<00:00:51.680> other<00:00:51.860> organic<00:00:52.579> fertilizers

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:53.300 
without we use other organic fertilizers

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:57.880 
without we use other organic fertilizers
I<00:00:53.329> use<00:00:54.019> a<00:00:54.050> lot<00:00:54.680> of<00:00:55.390> biological<00:00:56.589> products<00:00:57.589> that

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:57.890 
I use a lot of biological products that

00:00:57.890 --> 00:00:59.799 
I use a lot of biological products that
control<00:00:58.460> disease<00:00:58.820> and<00:00:59.120> increase<00:00:59.480> plant

00:00:59.799 --> 00:00:59.809 
control disease and increase plant

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:01.420 
control disease and increase plant
bigger<00:01:00.050> so<00:01:00.320> there's<00:01:00.500> a<00:01:00.589> lot<00:01:00.739> of<00:01:00.770> real

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:01.430 
bigger so there's a lot of real

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:03.369 
bigger so there's a lot of real
interesting<00:01:02.120> products<00:01:02.539> that<00:01:02.750> we<00:01:02.840> use<00:01:02.870> to<00:01:03.230> grow

00:01:03.369 --> 00:01:03.379 
interesting products that we use to grow

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:05.650 
interesting products that we use to grow
giant<00:01:03.620> pumpkins<00:01:04.190> that<00:01:04.369> probably<00:01:05.149> aren't<00:01:05.210> used

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:05.660 
giant pumpkins that probably aren't used

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:07.990 
giant pumpkins that probably aren't used
widely<00:01:06.320> especially<00:01:06.979> by<00:01:07.100> the<00:01:07.160> agricultural

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:08.000 
widely especially by the agricultural

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.790 
widely especially by the agricultural
industry<00:01:08.060> and<00:01:08.539> I'd<00:01:08.810> hope<00:01:09.020> down<00:01:09.259> the<00:01:09.410> line<00:01:09.590> we'd

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:09.800 
industry and I'd hope down the line we'd

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:11.560 
industry and I'd hope down the line we'd
actually<00:01:09.979> see<00:01:10.340> them<00:01:10.460> use<00:01:10.670> more<00:01:10.970> by<00:01:11.180> them<00:01:11.360> and

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:11.570 
actually see them use more by them and

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:14.139 
actually see them use more by them and
maybe<00:01:12.229> they<00:01:12.440> can<00:01:12.470> reap<00:01:13.280> the<00:01:13.429> benefits<00:01:13.850> that<00:01:13.940> we

00:01:14.139 --> 00:01:14.149 
maybe they can reap the benefits that we

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:23.649 
maybe they can reap the benefits that we
have

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:08.030 
I'd advise a new grower to not get too

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:09.880 
I'd advise a new grower to not get too
wrapped<00:02:08.239> up<00:02:08.539> and<00:02:08.750> growing<00:02:08.989> a<00:02:09.140> real<00:02:09.349> law<00:02:09.590> for

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:09.890 
wrapped up and growing a real law for

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:11.290 
wrapped up and growing a real law for
the<00:02:09.920> first<00:02:10.250> year<00:02:10.340> because<00:02:10.640> it's<00:02:10.789> a<00:02:10.880> ton<00:02:11.150> of

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:11.300 
the first year because it's a ton of

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:13.720 
the first year because it's a ton of
work<00:02:11.450> there's<00:02:12.170> a<00:02:12.230> huge<00:02:12.620> learning<00:02:12.920> curve<00:02:13.190> I

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:13.730 
work there's a huge learning curve I

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:15.790 
work there's a huge learning curve I
mean<00:02:14.000> anybody<00:02:14.239> can<00:02:14.599> plant<00:02:14.900> a<00:02:15.080> seed<00:02:15.290> and<00:02:15.349> give

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:15.800 
mean anybody can plant a seed and give

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.910 
mean anybody can plant a seed and give
it<00:02:15.940> you<00:02:16.940> know<00:02:17.030> just<00:02:17.270> a<00:02:17.540> real<00:02:17.959> minimal<00:02:18.650> amount

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:18.920 
it you know just a real minimal amount

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:21.190 
it you know just a real minimal amount
of<00:02:19.069> care<00:02:19.280> and<00:02:19.370> 500<00:02:19.970> pounds<00:02:20.390> is<00:02:20.480> pretty<00:02:20.750> easy<00:02:20.989> to

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.200 
of care and 500 pounds is pretty easy to

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:27.550 
of care and 500 pounds is pretty easy to
come<00:02:21.410> by<00:02:25.480> it's<00:02:26.480> just<00:02:26.599> amazing<00:02:26.840> how<00:02:27.050> big<00:02:27.410> these

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560 
come by it's just amazing how big these

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:29.050 
come by it's just amazing how big these
pumpkins<00:02:27.950> grow<00:02:28.160> and<00:02:28.310> they<00:02:28.400> say<00:02:28.580> like<00:02:28.760> in<00:02:28.880> two

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:29.060 
pumpkins grow and they say like in two

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:31.300 
pumpkins grow and they say like in two
years<00:02:29.239> there'll<00:02:29.599> be<00:02:29.630> a<00:02:29.720> 1-ton<00:02:30.230> pumpkin<00:02:30.310> and

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:31.310 
years there'll be a 1-ton pumpkin and

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:33.940 
years there'll be a 1-ton pumpkin and
I'm<00:02:31.430> going<00:02:31.580> to<00:02:31.610> grow<00:02:31.790> it
