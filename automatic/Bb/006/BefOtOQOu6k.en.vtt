there there's some play there and what
it's<00:03:17.239> doing<00:03:17.690> is<00:03:18.190> it<00:03:19.190> from<00:03:19.400> here<00:03:19.700> when<00:03:19.820> the<00:03:19.910> BB

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:20.180 
it's doing is it from here when the BB

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:22.510 
it's doing is it from here when the BB
comes<00:03:20.450> out<00:03:20.720> its<00:03:21.080> striking<00:03:21.470> the<00:03:21.800> inside<00:03:22.250> edge

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:22.520 
comes out its striking the inside edge

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:24.130 
comes out its striking the inside edge
of<00:03:22.670> the<00:03:22.790> front<00:03:23.090> and<00:03:23.360> it's<00:03:23.540> busting<00:03:23.989> these

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:24.140 
of the front and it's busting these

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:26.620 
of the front and it's busting these
babies<00:03:24.500> up<00:03:24.709> I<00:03:24.950> think<00:03:25.670> that<00:03:25.790> has<00:03:25.970> a<00:03:26.000> lot<00:03:26.120> to<00:03:26.330> do

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:26.630 
babies up I think that has a lot to do

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:27.970 
babies up I think that has a lot to do
with<00:03:26.660> it<00:03:26.989> because<00:03:27.320> if<00:03:27.440> you<00:03:27.560> look<00:03:27.739> at<00:03:27.860> the

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:27.980 
with it because if you look at the

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:30.640 
with it because if you look at the
supplied<00:03:28.370> flash<00:03:28.730> hider<00:03:29.170> it<00:03:30.170> looks<00:03:30.440> a<00:03:30.530> little

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:30.650 
supplied flash hider it looks a little

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:32.199 
supplied flash hider it looks a little
bit<00:03:30.890> bigger<00:03:31.160> in<00:03:31.310> circumference<00:03:31.910> it's

00:03:32.199 --> 00:03:32.209 
bit bigger in circumference it's

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:35.050 
bit bigger in circumference it's
definitely<00:03:32.840> bigger<00:03:33.110> here<00:03:33.650> than<00:03:33.860> it<00:03:34.640> is<00:03:34.670> right

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:35.060 
definitely bigger here than it is right

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:38.199 
definitely bigger here than it is right
there<00:03:35.420> so<00:03:36.230> I'm<00:03:37.130> thinking<00:03:37.520> that's<00:03:37.640> why<00:03:37.910> they

00:03:38.199 --> 00:03:38.209 
there so I'm thinking that's why they

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:41.530 
there so I'm thinking that's why they
sent<00:03:39.050> it<00:03:39.170> because<00:03:39.530> it<00:03:39.890> needs<00:03:40.100> it<00:03:40.400> and<00:03:40.730> I<00:03:41.180> didn't

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:41.540 
sent it because it needs it and I didn't

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:43.210 
sent it because it needs it and I didn't
change<00:03:41.840> it<00:03:42.050> because<00:03:42.470> I<00:03:42.709> was<00:03:42.800> like<00:03:42.980> well<00:03:43.190> maybe

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:43.220 
change it because I was like well maybe

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:45.220 
change it because I was like well maybe
I<00:03:43.700> don't<00:03:43.790> have<00:03:43.970> to<00:03:44.390> I<00:03:44.420> can<00:03:44.690> just<00:03:44.720> go<00:03:44.930> ahead<00:03:44.959> and

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:45.230 
I don't have to I can just go ahead and

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:47.920 
I don't have to I can just go ahead and
