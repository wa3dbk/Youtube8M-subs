your transformer looks like it's fairly
well<00:00:49.469> made<00:00:50.570> inserting<00:00:51.570> the<00:00:51.629> transformer<00:00:52.260> is

slider Dan camera side up once you get
it<00:01:01.469> in<00:01:01.559> there<00:01:01.770> I<00:01:01.800> found<00:01:02.070> it<00:01:02.280> the<00:01:02.370> best<00:01:02.550> to

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
it in there I found it the best to

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.140 
it in there I found it the best to
actually<00:01:03.210> flip<00:01:03.449> it<00:01:03.570> over<00:01:03.719> and<00:01:04.670> tuck<00:01:05.670> this<00:01:05.820> flap

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
actually flip it over and tuck this flap

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.030 
actually flip it over and tuck this flap
in<00:01:06.360> but<00:01:06.570> not<00:01:06.689> secure<00:01:07.140> it<00:01:07.260> yet<00:01:07.439> until<00:01:07.710> you<00:01:07.860> get

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
in but not secure it yet until you get

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.410 
in but not secure it yet until you get
it<00:01:08.510> tight<00:01:09.510> as<00:01:09.630> you<00:01:09.689> can<00:01:09.780> and<00:01:10.430> then<00:01:11.430> squeeze<00:01:12.299> it

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
it tight as you can and then squeeze it

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.120 
it tight as you can and then squeeze it
back<00:01:12.570> up<00:01:12.810> so<00:01:12.990> the<00:01:13.020> transformer<00:01:13.619> doesn't<00:01:13.920> slide

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
back up so the transformer doesn't slide

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:20.539 
back up so the transformer doesn't slide
around<00:01:14.689> vertically<00:01:15.689> in<00:01:15.810> here<00:01:19.040> this<00:01:20.040> case<00:01:20.310> has

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
around vertically in here this case has

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:24.679 
around vertically in here this case has
velcro<00:01:20.970> on<00:01:21.479> the<00:01:21.570> back<00:01:21.840> and<00:01:22.259> bottom<00:01:23.689> velcro's

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
velcro on the back and bottom velcro's

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:28.490 
velcro on the back and bottom velcro's
to<00:01:24.930> various<00:01:25.380> angles<00:01:25.590> on<00:01:26.100> this<00:01:26.610> so<00:01:26.880> you<00:01:26.939> can<00:01:27.500> set

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
to various angles on this so you can set

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.460 
to various angles on this so you can set
it<00:01:28.530> to<00:01:28.680> pretty<00:01:29.400> much<00:01:29.520> any<00:01:30.420> viewing<00:01:31.020> angle<00:01:31.290> you

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
it to pretty much any viewing angle you

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:36.170 
it to pretty much any viewing angle you
want<00:01:31.939> from<00:01:32.939> fairly<00:01:33.930> low<00:01:34.400> to<00:01:35.400> a<00:01:35.430> fairly<00:01:35.880> steep

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
want from fairly low to a fairly steep

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.260 
want from fairly low to a fairly steep
media<00:01:36.900> viewing<00:01:37.170> angle<00:01:37.759> low<00:01:38.759> angle<00:01:39.119> would<00:01:39.210> be

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
media viewing angle low angle would be

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.800 
media viewing angle low angle would be
mainly<00:01:39.630> for<00:01:39.900> typing<00:01:40.939> if<00:01:41.939> you<00:01:42.090> set<00:01:42.329> it<00:01:42.420> at<00:01:42.509> the

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
mainly for typing if you set it at the

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:47.990 
mainly for typing if you set it at the
lowest<00:01:43.409> angle<00:01:44.299> you<00:01:45.299> can<00:01:46.490> still<00:01:47.490> attached<00:01:47.759> the

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
lowest angle you can still attached the

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.609 
lowest angle you can still attached the
charger<00:01:48.479> and<00:01:48.630> still<00:01:48.810> have<00:01:48.930> the<00:01:49.049> cord<00:01:49.259> come<00:01:49.470> out

charger and still have the cord come out
without<00:01:49.770> getting<00:01:50.040> kinked<00:01:50.990> also<00:01:51.990> you<00:01:52.049> can

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
without getting kinked also you can

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:57.770

camera operation cameras not quite
perfectly<00:02:45.069> centered<00:02:45.370> in<00:02:45.580> there<00:02:45.760> but<00:02:46.110> pretty

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:47.110 
perfectly centered in there but pretty

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:50.699 
perfectly centered in there but pretty
darn<00:02:47.319> close<00:02:48.239> it's<00:02:49.239> got<00:02:49.390> three<00:02:49.630> magnets<00:02:50.019> one<00:02:50.620> on

00:02:50.699 --> 00:02:50.709 
darn close it's got three magnets one on

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:53.009 
darn close it's got three magnets one on
each<00:02:50.799> side<00:02:50.860> and<00:02:51.370> one<00:02:51.670> on<00:02:51.700> the<00:02:51.790> center<00:02:52.150> on<00:02:52.329> this

00:02:53.009 --> 00:02:53.019 
each side and one on the center on this

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:57.990 
each side and one on the center on this
flap<00:02:53.349> to<00:02:53.560> hold<00:02:53.739> it<00:02:53.890> shut<00:02:55.049> I<00:02:56.700> haven't<00:02:57.700> seen<00:02:57.849> it

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:58.000 
flap to hold it shut I haven't seen it

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.789 
flap to hold it shut I haven't seen it
to<00:02:58.060> interfere<00:02:58.450> anymore<00:02:58.720> with<00:02:59.079> the<00:02:59.290> compass

00:02:59.789 --> 00:02:59.799 
to interfere anymore with the compass

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:02.069 
to interfere anymore with the compass
then<00:03:00.040> the<00:03:00.250> 3.2<00:03:00.880> update<00:03:01.239> did<00:03:01.480> especially

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:02.079 
then the 3.2 update did especially

00:03:02.079 --> 00:03:08.100 
then the 3.2 update did especially
because<00:03:02.590> the<00:03:02.769> magnets<00:03:03.640> are<00:03:05.340> down<00:03:06.340> here<00:03:06.810> GPS<00:03:07.810> is

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:08.110 
because the magnets are down here GPS is

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:14.069 
because the magnets are down here GPS is
up<00:03:08.739> here<00:03:09.450> so<00:03:10.450> it's<00:03:10.810> a<00:03:11.019> pretty<00:03:11.470> far<00:03:11.799> away<00:03:13.079> one

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:14.079 
up here so it's a pretty far away one

00:03:14.079 --> 00:03:15.449 
up here so it's a pretty far away one
wish<00:03:14.260> I<00:03:14.440> had<00:03:14.590> is<00:03:14.709> if<00:03:14.829> it<00:03:14.920> would<00:03:15.040> magnet

00:03:15.449 --> 00:03:15.459 
wish I had is if it would magnet

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:16.949 
wish I had is if it would magnet
actually<00:03:15.790> in<00:03:15.850> the<00:03:15.910> open<00:03:16.209> position<00:03:16.239> but<00:03:16.870> the

00:03:16.949 --> 00:03:16.959 
actually in the open position but the

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:18.360 
actually in the open position but the
magnets<00:03:17.290> on<00:03:17.380> the<00:03:17.410> wrong<00:03:17.650> side<00:03:17.859> so<00:03:18.069> doesn't

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:18.370 
magnets on the wrong side so doesn't

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:22.530 
magnets on the wrong side so doesn't
magnet<00:03:18.910> open<00:03:20.549> but<00:03:21.549> that<00:03:22.239> could<00:03:22.420> also

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:22.540 
magnet open but that could also

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:25.949 
magnet open but that could also
potentially<00:03:22.930> interfere<00:03:23.590> with<00:03:23.769> the<00:03:24.389> GPS<00:03:25.389> so

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:25.959 
potentially interfere with the GPS so

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:29.640 
potentially interfere with the GPS so
not<00:03:26.650> a<00:03:26.680> dock<00:03:27.340> friendly<00:03:28.079> case<00:03:29.079> as<00:03:29.350> some<00:03:29.530> of<00:03:29.590> the

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:29.650 
not a dock friendly case as some of the

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:31.860 
not a dock friendly case as some of the
other<00:03:29.769> ones<00:03:29.950> are<00:03:30.100> as<00:03:30.370> this<00:03:31.060> flap<00:03:31.420> gets<00:03:31.690> in<00:03:31.810> the

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:31.870 
other ones are as this flap gets in the

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:33.660 
other ones are as this flap gets in the
way<00:03:32.019> of<00:03:32.170> docking<00:03:32.590> it<00:03:32.680> if<00:03:32.769> you<00:03:32.859> flip<00:03:33.100> this<00:03:33.280> open

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:33.670 
way of docking it if you flip this open

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:36.240 
way of docking it if you flip this open
and<00:03:33.790> try<00:03:33.880> to<00:03:33.940> dock<00:03:34.209> it<00:03:34.480> the<00:03:34.959> whole<00:03:35.109> case<00:03:35.380> slides

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:36.250 
and try to dock it the whole case slides

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:40.680 
and try to dock it the whole case slides
up<00:03:36.600> but<00:03:37.600> anyway<00:03:38.380> good<00:03:39.180> good<00:03:40.180> case<00:03:40.420> when<00:03:40.660> you

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:40.690 
up but anyway good good case when you

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:43.410 
up but anyway good good case when you
want<00:03:40.930> a<00:03:41.049> tablet<00:03:41.859> style<00:03:42.280> and<00:03:42.519> the<00:03:43.209> price<00:03:43.389> is

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:43.420 
want a tablet style and the price is

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:45.360 
want a tablet style and the price is
right<00:03:43.600> so<00:03:44.019> once<00:03:44.170> again<00:03:44.260> this<00:03:44.380> is<00:03:44.500> the<00:03:44.560> Viper

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:45.370 
right so once again this is the Viper

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:48.960 
right so once again this is the Viper
