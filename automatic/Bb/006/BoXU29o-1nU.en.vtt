00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:17.040

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:19.500
 welcome channel people again to 

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:21.779
 a new video of mirjam at it will be 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.580
 finally happy with youtube and yes 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:25.740
 today black ops the background of 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.300
 a buddy also plays so the 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.320
 actually normal to me today 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.520
 just the gameplay of him 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.080
 the forest also used no cars 

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:33.570
 that will definitely be right for you 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.040
 critical board people and yes people what 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.600
 I still wanted to say so if you 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.129
 somehow somehow help with subscribers 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.780
 Word or so can be more from now 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:41.040
 your yellowish to we're sometimes look 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.659
 maybe one of you is lucky 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.600
 for the next gameplay will be for 

00:00:42.659 --> 00:00:47.100
 but there are now well and well on the 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.080
 Today I understand the youtuber 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.699
 Of course no monster is invited 

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:52.949
 or marcel summer something like that 

00:00:50.699 --> 00:00:55.949
 youtube but still very good youtube 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:58.440
 youtube to a word you said the 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:59.879
 if you should answer question 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.580
 you could have a great power 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:05.040
 which would it be and why exactly 

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:06.390
 These are the ones we also have 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.190
 sent a cancer and yes the 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.060
 sometimes everything happens and ends up 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:11.520
 In any case that means me 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:15.210
 stay tuned and say off with 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:19.430
 the first clip hello you love me 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.430
 yes she already knows me from the net 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:29.070
 if I could have a great power 

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:32.640
 that would definitely be me as bibi 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:36.600
 blocksberg witches and can fly so 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.650
 she can make as heck went on and 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.300
 flying her broom 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:43.620
 But you can not do it for example 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:45.450
 so things witches like money or let 

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:47.760
 could influence people too much like that 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:51.240
 I would not do that for a start 

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:53.550
 would then simply free balls and everything 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.490
 Everything can influence so to speak and 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:58.080
 that's what the world is open to me 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:59.909
 and what more would you want us to do 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:02.960
 super cool and that comes naturally 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:02.960
 also that you can fly 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:07.260
 So I'll be the only one and 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:08.170
 nobody could do that from my family 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:12.160
 and that would be 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:15.340
 So what I would like to yes 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:17.140
 can summarized here is safe now 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:19.569
 I am entirely referring to the answer 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:21.610
 the question on what would i do if i did 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:23.260
 super powers relationship what a super 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:26.380
 I would like to have gau 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:28.180
 as I would like to have the time travel 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:30.730
 as a superpower because i could do so much 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:32.560
 shit build as I want so often finds 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:34.900
 I can always do it again 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:36.819
 just no jackets so said if 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:40.150
 travel in the past in the 

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:41.800
 Looking forward to what I will later and 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:44.050
 Anything else that was right 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:44.650
 Properly try on them superpower 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:46.930
 to have 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:48.489
 I had to fax so much it would be 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:50.560
 really shit 

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:52.569
 In any case , I would like to have 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:53.260
 this superpower because that just bomb 

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:55.959
 would 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:58.600
 well, good people so I already have 

00:02:55.959 --> 00:03:00.790

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:02.350
 want you now was great today 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:05.590
 I like to have 

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:08.200
 and that's something weird but for 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:10.120
 not my favorite superpower 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:12.040
 now so much so that not even 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:13.570
 but that's always the case with me 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:17.019
 would stand up 

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:19.480
 what I as a superkraft draftsman who is 

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:22.600
 to be able to eat what I want when I want 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:25.480
 I want as much as I want to take me 

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:27.370
 so eat without taking and that he 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:29.380
 For me personally, no mega 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:31.200
 super power because the legal me 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:34.660
 But know that few people the law 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:36.790
 that he has my dream to do that in 

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:39.070
 to have my next life 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:42.070
 and then of course I would like too 

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:43.630
 like to read thoughts 

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:48.260
 can 

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:50.870
 Women can and from but eat us too 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:56.720
 would take me to place 1 on 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:58.640
 every case like that and after all the girl 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:00.440
 finally again a young and me 

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:01.790
 I would wish each one up to 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:02.540
 every call of duty opponent 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:05.390
 teleport 

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:06.920
 if I want it oh my god if I want 

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:08.450
 the superpower would have the happiest 

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:08.950
 man of the world people you have to 

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:11.960
 imagine 

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:13.610
 since then the 10 or so then you are dying 

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:14.330
 and then just teleport to 

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:16.160
 the way there 

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:18.260
 We clap in one and then again 

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:19.910
 I find that home even when I'm at home 

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:20.959
 me really strong for everyone 

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:22.760
 Opponents just times so many games 

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:24.170
 could someone could clap and 

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:25.730
 then go home before somehow 

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:27.980
 something checks I think that's easy 

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:29.240
 only even people and I hope the whole 

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:30.680
 again has fallen in any case 

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:32.000
