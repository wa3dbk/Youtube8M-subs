00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
we have castro here he he looks on the

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.240 
we have castro here he he looks on the
card<00:00:12.150> he<00:00:12.389> seems<00:00:12.750> to<00:00:12.900> have<00:00:12.929> very<00:00:13.440> bad<00:00:13.740> stats

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
card he seems to have very bad stats

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:16.700 
card he seems to have very bad stats
which<00:00:14.490> is<00:00:14.670> really<00:00:14.910> good<00:00:15.150> so<00:00:15.750> i<00:00:16.260> thought<00:00:16.500> i

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
which is really good so i thought i

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:18.470 
which is really good so i thought i
would<00:00:16.740> try<00:00:16.980> them<00:00:17.160> out<00:00:17.279> many<00:00:17.670> of<00:00:17.789> you<00:00:17.940> requested

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
would try them out many of you requested

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.540 
would try them out many of you requested
him<00:00:18.600> so<00:00:19.050> i<00:00:19.080> thought<00:00:19.320> to<00:00:19.439> myself<00:00:19.500> why<00:00:20.070> not<00:00:20.100> he

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
him so i thought to myself why not he

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:21.920 
him so i thought to myself why not he
seems<00:00:20.789> like<00:00:20.939> a<00:00:21.000> really<00:00:21.240> good<00:00:21.449> all-round

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
seems like a really good all-round

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.529 
seems like a really good all-round
player<00:00:22.170> so<00:00:22.710> first<00:00:23.310> to<00:00:23.490> begin<00:00:23.760> with<00:00:23.970> his<00:00:24.210> his

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
player so first to begin with his his

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:27.230 
player so first to begin with his his
pace<00:00:24.840> is<00:00:25.140> decent<00:00:25.680> he's<00:00:25.890> not<00:00:26.099> slow<00:00:26.550> at<00:00:26.699> all<00:00:26.730> but

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
pace is decent he's not slow at all but

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.570 
pace is decent he's not slow at all but
he's<00:00:27.359> not<00:00:27.510> extremely<00:00:28.109> fast<00:00:28.560> as<00:00:28.769> well<00:00:29.010> so<00:00:29.429> he's

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
he's not extremely fast as well so he's

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.310 
he's not extremely fast as well so he's
got<00:00:29.789> decent<00:00:30.000> pace<00:00:30.359> and<00:00:30.510> his<00:00:30.570> shirt<00:00:30.869> power<00:00:31.080> and

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
got decent pace and his shirt power and

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.049 
got decent pace and his shirt power and
long<00:00:31.529> shots<00:00:31.800> or<00:00:32.009> decent<00:00:32.430> as<00:00:32.550> well<00:00:32.730> you<00:00:32.880> could

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
long shots or decent as well you could

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:34.459 
long shots or decent as well you could
bang<00:00:33.270> out<00:00:33.450> a<00:00:33.480> long<00:00:33.690> shots<00:00:33.899> from<00:00:34.079> four<00:00:34.320> yards

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
bang out a long shots from four yards

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:36.770 
bang out a long shots from four yards
out<00:00:34.770> in<00:00:34.950> hopes<00:00:35.399> they<00:00:35.610> go<00:00:35.790> in<00:00:35.969> most<00:00:36.510> of<00:00:36.630> the<00:00:36.719> time

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
out in hopes they go in most of the time

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.020 
out in hopes they go in most of the time
they<00:00:37.140> won't<00:00:37.440> but<00:00:37.620> sometimes<00:00:38.129> his<00:00:38.579> shooting

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
they won't but sometimes his shooting

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.450 
they won't but sometimes his shooting
can<00:00:39.270> be<00:00:39.420> very<00:00:39.780> surprising<00:00:40.590> like<00:00:40.980> I<00:00:41.010> would

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
can be very surprising like I would

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.010 
can be very surprising like I would
school<00:00:41.820> shorts<00:00:42.180> I<00:00:42.300> would<00:00:42.510> be<00:00:42.629> like<00:00:42.750> what<00:00:42.989> the

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
school shorts I would be like what the

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.290 
school shorts I would be like what the
 how<00:00:43.770> did<00:00:43.980> those<00:00:44.129> go<00:00:44.370> in<00:00:44.399> but<00:00:45.030> his

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
 how did those go in but his

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.049 
 how did those go in but his
shooting<00:00:45.989> can<00:00:46.260> be<00:00:46.670> inconsistent<00:00:47.670> and

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
shooting can be inconsistent and

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:49.700 
shooting can be inconsistent and
sometimes<00:00:48.629> he<00:00:48.840> would<00:00:48.870> miss<00:00:49.140> shots<00:00:49.440> that

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
sometimes he would miss shots that

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.889 
sometimes he would miss shots that
should<00:00:49.950> have<00:00:50.129> went<00:00:50.430> in<00:00:50.670> now<00:00:51.210> he's<00:00:51.480> a<00:00:51.510> really

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
should have went in now he's a really

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:53.270 
should have went in now he's a really
good<00:00:52.079> finisher<00:00:52.469> as<00:00:52.590> well<00:00:52.770> in<00:00:52.949> the<00:00:53.039> penalty

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
good finisher as well in the penalty

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.400 
good finisher as well in the penalty
area<00:00:53.430> he's<00:00:53.910> really<00:00:54.449> reliable<00:00:54.809> I<00:00:54.989> think<00:00:55.199> he<00:00:55.289> has

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
area he's really reliable I think he has

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.950 
area he's really reliable I think he has
90<00:00:55.829> finishing<00:00:56.250> in<00:00:56.430> gay<00:00:56.670> in<00:00:57.120> his<00:00:57.329> in<00:00:57.510> game<00:00:57.690> stats

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
90 finishing in gay in his in game stats

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.080 
90 finishing in gay in his in game stats
so<00:00:58.500> he's<00:00:58.649> really<00:00:58.859> good<00:00:59.039> at<00:00:59.129> that<00:00:59.280> also<00:00:59.879> he's<00:01:00.059> a

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
so he's really good at that also he's a

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.080 
so he's really good at that also he's a
decent<00:01:00.510> dribbler<00:01:01.230> so<00:01:01.500> he's<00:01:02.309> not<00:01:02.489> like<00:01:02.670> a<00:01:02.699> tank

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
decent dribbler so he's not like a tank

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.060 
decent dribbler so he's not like a tank
to<00:01:03.329> move<00:01:03.510> or<00:01:03.780> the<00:01:03.960> Titanic<00:01:04.589> or<00:01:04.739> anything<00:01:05.040> like

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
to move or the Titanic or anything like

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:06.890 
to move or the Titanic or anything like
that<00:01:05.189> he's<00:01:05.850> decent<00:01:06.330> to<00:01:06.420> dribble<00:01:06.689> the<00:01:06.810> ball

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
that he's decent to dribble the ball

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.960 
that he's decent to dribble the ball
with<00:01:07.110> but<00:01:07.320> he's<00:01:07.470> not<00:01:07.650> anything<00:01:07.979> like<00:01:08.189> Valbuena

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
with but he's not anything like Valbuena

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.320 
with but he's not anything like Valbuena
or<00:01:09.299> messy<00:01:10.049> so<00:01:10.439> he's<00:01:11.189> he's<00:01:11.640> just<00:01:11.850> a<00:01:11.970> decent

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
or messy so he's he's just a decent

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.420 
or messy so he's he's just a decent
dribbler<00:01:12.659> pretty<00:01:12.869> much<00:01:12.990> he's<00:01:13.380> also<00:01:13.619> got<00:01:13.950> 99

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
dribbler pretty much he's also got 99

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.460 
dribbler pretty much he's also got 99
reactions<00:01:15.210> so<00:01:15.330> he<00:01:15.479> reacts<00:01:15.780> quickly<00:01:16.140> on<00:01:16.380> the

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
reactions so he reacts quickly on the

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.830 
reactions so he reacts quickly on the
ball<00:01:16.650> if<00:01:17.310> he<00:01:17.850> falls<00:01:18.090> down<00:01:18.180> he<00:01:18.450> stands<00:01:18.689> up

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
ball if he falls down he stands up

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.749 
ball if he falls down he stands up
pretty<00:01:19.110> quick<00:01:19.320> so<00:01:19.740> that<00:01:19.770> is<00:01:20.130> really<00:01:20.159> good<00:01:20.580> when

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
pretty quick so that is really good when

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.760 
pretty quick so that is really good when
it<00:01:20.850> comes<00:01:21.030> down<00:01:21.180> to<00:01:21.240> his<00:01:21.450> reactions<00:01:22.020> also<00:01:22.680> he

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
it comes down to his reactions also he

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.980 
it comes down to his reactions also he
has<00:01:22.920> decent<00:01:23.159> high<00:01:23.460> he's<00:01:23.700> foot<00:01:23.970> five<00:01:24.630> foot<00:01:24.810> nine

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
has decent high he's foot five foot nine

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.870 
has decent high he's foot five foot nine
so<00:01:25.350> he<00:01:25.890> could<00:01:26.040> get<00:01:26.159> those<00:01:26.369> Heather's<00:01:26.729> in<00:01:26.759> it

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
so he could get those Heather's in it

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.700 
so he could get those Heather's in it
for<00:01:27.270> you<00:01:27.420> as<00:01:27.570> well<00:01:27.750> if<00:01:27.930> you<00:01:28.020> want<00:01:28.170> to<00:01:28.229> cross<00:01:28.409> in

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
for you as well if you want to cross in

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.310 
for you as well if you want to cross in
but<00:01:29.220> the<00:01:29.369> the<00:01:29.670> negatives<00:01:30.479> I<00:01:30.630> find<00:01:30.900> about<00:01:31.140> him

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
but the the negatives I find about him

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.140 
but the the negatives I find about him
is<00:01:31.470> his<00:01:31.619> work<00:01:31.920> rates<00:01:32.189> are<00:01:32.700> not<00:01:32.909> really

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
is his work rates are not really

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:34.969 
is his work rates are not really
suitable<00:01:33.659> for<00:01:33.960> a<00:01:33.990> striker<00:01:34.320> because<00:01:34.650> he<00:01:34.829> has

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
suitable for a striker because he has

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.640 
suitable for a striker because he has
medium<00:01:35.820> attacking<00:01:36.540> and<00:01:36.720> low<00:01:36.960> defensive

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
medium attacking and low defensive

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.620 
medium attacking and low defensive
workrate<00:01:37.860> so<00:01:38.460> he<00:01:38.640> seems<00:01:38.790> more<00:01:39.060> suitable<00:01:39.509> in

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
workrate so he seems more suitable in

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.359 
workrate so he seems more suitable in
the<00:01:39.720> center<00:01:40.020> forward<00:01:40.350> roll<00:01:40.560> center<00:01:40.890> attacking

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
the center forward roll center attacking

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.670 
the center forward roll center attacking
midfielder<00:01:41.759> oh<00:01:41.790> also<00:01:42.390> his<00:01:42.750> financial<00:01:43.350> is<00:01:43.470> one

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680

shots with this guy it pretty much went

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.270

in<00:01:57.390> every<00:01:57.630> single<00:01:58.290> time<00:01:58.710> well<00:01:58.920> maybe<00:01:59.100> not

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
in every single time well maybe not

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.160 
in every single time well maybe not
every<00:01:59.549> single<00:01:59.700> time<00:02:00.060> but<00:02:00.329> his<00:02:00.540> finisher<00:02:01.020> is

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
every single time but his finisher is

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.499 
every single time but his finisher is
really<00:02:01.619> reliable<00:02:01.979> to<00:02:02.280> use<00:02:02.520> and<00:02:02.759> also<00:02:03.270> he<00:02:03.390> has

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
really reliable to use and also he has

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
which i think is pretty bad to be honest

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:09.169 
which i think is pretty bad to be honest
with<00:02:07.560> you<00:02:07.680> guys<00:02:07.860> when<00:02:08.399> i<00:02:08.429> tried<00:02:08.759> to<00:02:08.789> use<00:02:08.940> his

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
with you guys when i tried to use his

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:10.430 
with you guys when i tried to use his
left<00:02:09.420> for<00:02:09.690> you<00:02:09.750> it<00:02:09.899> didn't<00:02:10.170> seem<00:02:10.349> very

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
left for you it didn't seem very

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.070 
left for you it didn't seem very
effective<00:02:11.160> in<00:02:11.280> my<00:02:11.430> opinion<00:02:11.730> so<00:02:12.300> his<00:02:12.660> freestyle

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
effective in my opinion so his freestyle

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.850 
effective in my opinion so his freestyle
week<00:02:13.260> for

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
week for

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.550 
week for
pretty<00:02:14.220> much<00:02:14.370> a<00:02:14.400> freestyle<00:02:14.880> weak<00:02:15.090> foot<00:02:15.330> so<00:02:15.870> his

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
pretty much a freestyle weak foot so his

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.890 
pretty much a freestyle weak foot so his
work<00:02:16.770> rates<00:02:17.010> like<00:02:17.190> I<00:02:17.310> said<00:02:17.610> do<00:02:18.120> not<00:02:18.270> feel

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
work rates like I said do not feel

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.350 
work rates like I said do not feel
suitable<00:02:19.500> for<00:02:19.650> a<00:02:19.680> strike<00:02:20.010> a<00:02:20.040> role<00:02:20.340> and<00:02:20.550> he<00:02:21.060> felt

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
suitable for a strike a role and he felt

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.000 
suitable for a strike a role and he felt
we<00:02:21.870> could<00:02:22.140> then<00:02:22.320> he<00:02:22.560> should<00:02:22.830> have<00:02:22.980> been

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
we could then he should have been

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:24.890 
we could then he should have been
sometimes<00:02:23.850> I<00:02:24.000> just<00:02:24.060> felt<00:02:24.420> with<00:02:24.540> defenders

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
sometimes I just felt with defenders

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:26.690 
sometimes I just felt with defenders
were<00:02:25.050> easily<00:02:25.440> taking<00:02:25.890> the<00:02:26.010> ball<00:02:26.190> of<00:02:26.340> film<00:02:26.580> it

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
doesn't matter what sort of defender you

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:30.050 
doesn't matter what sort of defender you
had<00:02:28.200> they<00:02:28.710> were<00:02:28.770> just<00:02:29.010> easily<00:02:29.430> taking<00:02:29.790> him<00:02:29.970> off

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
had they were just easily taking him off

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.450 
had they were just easily taking him off
the<00:02:30.240> ball<00:02:30.420> and<00:02:31.010> do<00:02:32.010> you<00:02:32.070> have<00:02:32.190> to<00:02:32.280> take<00:02:32.430> that

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:32.460 
the ball and do you have to take that

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:34.100 
the ball and do you have to take that
into<00:02:32.610> consideration<00:02:32.760> when<00:02:33.510> you<00:02:33.720> were<00:02:33.810> picking

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
into consideration when you were picking

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:36.920 
into consideration when you were picking
your<00:02:34.230> centerfold<00:02:34.830> or<00:02:35.040> your<00:02:35.610> strike<00:02:35.940> or<00:02:36.150> if<00:02:36.600> you

forget<00:03:09.060> about<00:03:09.120> that<00:03:09.239> he<00:03:09.959> has<00:03:10.110> decent<00:03:10.380> height

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:10.709 
forget about that he has decent height

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:13.790 
forget about that he has decent height
which<00:03:11.520> is<00:03:11.550> 5<00:03:11.910> foot<00:03:12.090> 9<00:03:12.330> and<00:03:12.570> also<00:03:13.170> his<00:03:13.350> decent

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:13.800 
which is 5 foot 9 and also his decent

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:15.620 
which is 5 foot 9 and also his decent
heading<00:03:14.250> I<00:03:14.370> think<00:03:14.610> he's<00:03:14.730> heading<00:03:15.090> accuracy<00:03:15.390> in

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 
heading I think he's heading accuracy in

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:17.570 
heading I think he's heading accuracy in
some<00:03:15.840> way<00:03:15.959> in<00:03:16.020> the<00:03:16.110> 70s<00:03:16.590> and<00:03:16.680> so<00:03:17.190> is<00:03:17.370> his

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:17.580 
some way in the 70s and so is his

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:19.820 
some way in the 70s and so is his
jumping<00:03:18.060> his<00:03:18.780> work<00:03:19.019> rates<00:03:19.320> this<00:03:19.680> is

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:19.830 
jumping his work rates this is

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:22.490 
jumping his work rates this is
negativities<00:03:20.610> work<00:03:20.820> rates<00:03:21.060> are<00:03:21.330> not<00:03:21.720> suitable

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
negativities work rates are not suitable

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:24.229 
negativities work rates are not suitable
in<00:03:22.739> my<00:03:22.920> opinion<00:03:23.190> for<00:03:23.430> a<00:03:23.459> striker<00:03:23.850> role<00:03:24.090> he

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:24.239 
in my opinion for a striker role he

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:26.060 
in my opinion for a striker role he
seems<00:03:24.480> more<00:03:24.690> bear<00:03:24.989> in<00:03:25.140> the<00:03:25.260> center<00:03:25.830> for

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:26.070 
seems more bear in the center for

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:28.580 
seems more bear in the center for
Santa's<00:03:26.790> ahmed<00:03:27.209> field<00:03:27.360> a<00:03:27.480> row<00:03:27.630> also<00:03:28.350> he<00:03:28.470> has

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
Santa's ahmed field a row also he has

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:30.410 
Santa's ahmed field a row also he has
freestyle<00:03:29.010> skills<00:03:29.310> and<00:03:29.489> freestyle<00:03:30.000> weak<00:03:30.180> foot

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:30.420 
freestyle skills and freestyle weak foot

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:33.530 
freestyle skills and freestyle weak foot
and<00:03:30.600> he<00:03:31.140> felt<00:03:31.440> weaker<00:03:31.980> than<00:03:32.160> he<00:03:32.340> should<00:03:32.400> be<00:03:32.640> so

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:33.540 
and he felt weaker than he should be so

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:34.910 
and he felt weaker than he should be so
