are<00:00:52.410> great<00:00:52.680> by<00:00:53.039> nitrates<00:00:53.610> are<00:00:53.820> at<00:00:54.000> about<00:00:54.239> 10

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
are great by nitrates are at about 10

00:00:54.539 --> 00:01:04.080 
are great by nitrates are at about 10

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:04.090 

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:10.710 

see<00:01:06.670> phosphates<00:01:07.670> those<00:01:08.090> are<00:01:08.650> pretty<00:01:09.650> low<00:01:09.890> too

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:10.720 
see phosphates those are pretty low too

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:17.520 
see phosphates those are pretty low too
and<00:01:11.980> I<00:01:12.980> got<00:01:13.190> a<00:01:13.250> 36<00:01:13.730> wat<00:01:14.000> light<00:01:14.240> running<00:01:15.310> about

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:17.530 
and I got a 36 wat light running about

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:30.780 
and I got a 36 wat light running about
seven<00:01:18.530> hours<00:01:18.650> a<00:01:18.860> day<00:01:19.480> on<00:01:20.480> a<00:01:20.540> timer

this is or a solution to it please just
message<00:01:42.550> me

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:55.130 

i<00:01:49.400> have<00:01:50.400> been<00:01:50.580> using<00:01:50.790> tap<00:01:51.150> water<00:01:54.110> but<00:01:55.110> I

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
i have been using tap water but I

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.499 
i have been using tap water but I
condition<00:01:55.740> it<00:01:55.860> with<00:01:56.070> this<00:01:56.670> which<00:01:57.090> is<00:01:57.240> supposed

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
condition it with this which is supposed

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:05.620 
condition it with this which is supposed
to<00:01:57.570> be<00:01:57.659> really<00:01:57.690> good<00:01:58.310> and<00:01:59.310> I<00:01:59.430> double<00:01:59.850> dose<00:02:00.030> it

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:05.630 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:26.920 

so<00:02:06.630> I<00:02:09.500> mean<00:02:10.500> like<00:02:10.649> I<00:02:10.800> said<00:02:10.830> I<00:02:11.100> test<00:02:11.459> my<00:02:11.550> water

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:26.930 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:30.630 

iodine<00:02:27.920> point<00:02:28.849> OA<00:02:29.030> I<00:02:29.269> was<00:02:29.719> supplementing<00:02:30.409> and

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:30.640 
iodine point OA I was supplementing and

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:33.220 
iodine point OA I was supplementing and
I<00:02:31.640> think<00:02:31.849> it<00:02:32.000> I<00:02:32.120> simply<00:02:32.569> blend<00:02:32.750> a<00:02:32.870> little<00:02:32.900> too

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:33.230 
I think it I simply blend a little too

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:40.470 
I think it I simply blend a little too
much<00:02:33.439> magnesium<00:02:35.739> 1000<00:02:37.390> calcium<00:02:38.680> 500

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:47.859 
phosphates point to ph 8.0 a plenty 300

00:02:47.859 --> 00:02:51.039 
phosphates point to ph 8.0 a plenty 300
right<00:02:48.859> here<00:02:49.040> says<00:02:49.310> 20<00:02:49.939> listen<00:02:50.299> sup<00:02:50.510> tested<00:02:50.930> it

00:02:51.039 --> 00:02:51.049 
right here says 20 listen sup tested it

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:41.640 
to one or I think 1.2 1021 something
like<00:03:38.590> that<00:03:38.800> but<00:03:39.099> yet<00:03:39.340> it's<00:03:39.849> fine<00:03:40.319> it's<00:03:41.319> a

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:41.650 
like that but yet it's fine it's a

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:44.759 
like that but yet it's fine it's a
little<00:03:42.190> low<00:03:42.370> but<00:03:42.640> it's<00:03:42.849> fun<00:03:43.209> I<00:03:43.480> did<00:03:44.410> have<00:03:44.530> it<00:03:44.650> at

00:03:44.759 --> 00:03:44.769 
little low but it's fun I did have it at

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:47.009 
little low but it's fun I did have it at
22<00:03:45.190> and<00:03:45.459> I<00:03:45.760> dropped<00:03:46.030> it<00:03:46.239> because<00:03:46.390> I<00:03:46.780> didn't

00:03:47.009 --> 00:03:47.019 
22 and I dropped it because I didn't

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:50.520 
22 and I dropped it because I didn't
know<00:03:47.049> if<00:03:48.239> he<00:03:49.239> had<00:03:49.269> sensitive<00:03:50.080> and<00:03:50.349> I<00:03:50.410> was

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:50.530 
know if he had sensitive and I was

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:53.819 
know if he had sensitive and I was
thinking<00:03:50.590> maybe<00:03:50.950> parasites<00:03:51.640> might<00:03:51.970> of<00:03:52.829> my

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:53.829 
thinking maybe parasites might of my

thinking maybe parasites might of my
slide<00:03:54.130> it<00:03:54.370> was<00:03:54.489> a<00:03:54.519> little<00:03:54.700> high<00:03:54.940> so<00:03:55.360> i<00:04:01.980> don't

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:02.980 
slide it was a little high so i don't

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:05.910 
slide it was a little high so i don't
know<00:04:03.099> i<00:04:03.400> think<00:04:03.670> he's<00:04:04.120> fine<00:04:04.390> actually<00:04:04.780> but<00:04:05.470> the

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:05.920 
know i think he's fine actually but the

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:11.069 
know i think he's fine actually but the
