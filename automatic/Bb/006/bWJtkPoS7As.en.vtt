 the car needs carpets or tufted 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:11.570
 such a summertime option either 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:16.190
 rubber or polyurethane field 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:18.330
 he likes more but in the cabin prices 

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:21.150
 very very overpriced and 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:24.779
 in the market of this option whatever me 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:26.760
 I made a simply decided not found 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.500
 do as follows went 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:32.489
 construction hypermarket 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:36.180
 found that light that carpet material 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:39.570
 which I liked bought for a cut 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.760
 here is a small roll cost this not 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:45.750
 roll 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:47.460
 literally 130 with a penny hryvnia that's what 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:52.410
 share with you how I did about 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:56.520
 myself in the car look here so 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:01:00.090
 from me the drawing came to my liking 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:03.059
 did i took just initially with 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:07.020
 using plain cardboard of a free 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:12.659
 ravana made a measurement got q here 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:15.840
 cut everything in the format here translated 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:17.700
 on the carpet material he is such a pro 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:21.650
 rubber on the rubberized side 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:26.549
 he does not slide through the cabin while he 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:29.490
 less hard here bought such 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:30.000
 little black kontiki first stuck it 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:37.710
 round 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:40.909
 and then stitched left-right mats 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:43.429
 rear passengers made one pattern 

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:46.530
 simply 

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:49.200
 mirrored and transferred wore 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:52.310
 40 rug between the mine covered here 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.310
 such here is a small segment 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:02:04.500
 that's so very small too 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:06.990
 taped and then flashed all nothing 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:11.099
 passengers drop their feet do not hurt 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:12.650
 handcrafted carpets 

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:16.099
 work 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:21.180
 no matter how funny it sounds look at 

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:26.879
 front front was more complicated so 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:28.470
 most patterns so in the manufacture of so 

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:34.379
 same thing with ordinary cardboard 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:38.609
 made measurements all the cuts all all as 

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:41.760
 put here then after that 

00:02:38.609 --> 00:02:45.500
 here here even under the buttons made such 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:49.340
 a small gap of three cups mean 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:55.560
 trunk and gas tank further made 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:58.950
 retraction for the left leg for rest and here 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:04.700
 it also covered up a separate 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:07.489
 pieces this material 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:10.450
 from which to do prevention on shoes 

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:14.060
 why did he take it because he 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:17.780
 very drains to abrasion that is here here 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:20.390
 I have not been long and long 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:22.910
 will be wiped as in ordinary carpets 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:28.310
 also this mat lays down as much as possible 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:32.920
 next, the number is never the difference of the carpet 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:37.040
 Lenchik car and another small nuance 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:39.830
 when we hit the pedal with our right foot 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:40.760
 gas for the hour of that for now I hit this 

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:42.680
 here is a part 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:44.870
 and here most of the car is all 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:47.410
 freaked out how i came out with this 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:51.349
 set situation will show you 

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:58.959
 made soul a little more detail here 

00:03:51.349 --> 00:04:03.470
 So here's the plan, the edge of the details I again 

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:09.670
 stitched edging'll show you where it 

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:14.389
 here we install our three pedals and here 

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:19.880
 under the main carpet a little like that 

00:04:14.389 --> 00:04:23.560
 deflection checks I installed this small 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:29.300
 part now when we have magicians 

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:33.190
 get on the pedal we're just there 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:43.070
 I 'll show you closer 

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:47.539
 you do not buy a pack from us ok rug 

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:50.990
 also also rubberized yes and he is not sol 

00:04:47.539 --> 00:04:57.880
 This is generally all about the cabin keeps everything 

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:57.880
 well, that's how it looks like in work 

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:09.280
 here yes we do not get trash because 

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:09.280
 then with only 

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:17.710
 well pantomime overlays so I pull out 

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:25.259
 show you what he looks like 

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:28.419
 and the carpet looks like this 

00:05:25.259 --> 00:05:30.460
 simplicity of kauri which they are sold from 

00:05:28.419 --> 00:05:33.750
 thin material they are very fast 

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:39.090
 lose their shape and the same instance 

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:44.199
 plus here this stuff for 

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:47.139
 prevented others and reliable 

00:05:44.199 --> 00:05:50.639
 first glue it stuck then 

00:05:47.139 --> 00:05:50.639
 in a circle still and taxi 

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:57.660
 just as easy to install it 

00:06:02.699 --> 00:06:12.400
