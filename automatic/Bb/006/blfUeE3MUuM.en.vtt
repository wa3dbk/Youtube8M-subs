tastes good give me more that's

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.200 
tastes good give me more that's
problematic<00:00:49.920> because<00:00:50.129> then<00:00:50.610> your<00:00:50.760> pancreas

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
problematic because then your pancreas

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.299 
problematic because then your pancreas
has<00:00:51.660> to<00:00:51.870> produce<00:00:52.020> more<00:00:52.500> and<00:00:52.559> more<00:00:52.949> insulin

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
has to produce more and more insulin

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.189 
has to produce more and more insulin
insulin<00:00:53.940> is<00:00:54.270> represented<00:00:54.719> by<00:00:54.750> these<00:00:54.840> green

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
insulin is represented by these green

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.130 
insulin is represented by these green
dots<00:00:55.230> that's<00:00:56.010> sugar<00:00:56.640> insulin<00:00:57.329> grabs<00:00:57.840> the

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
dots that's sugar insulin grabs the

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.369 
dots that's sugar insulin grabs the
sugar<00:00:58.410> shuttles<00:00:59.309> it<00:00:59.460> into<00:01:00.059> your<00:01:00.300> body's<00:01:00.660> cells

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
sugar shuttles it into your body's cells

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.100 
sugar shuttles it into your body's cells
no<00:01:01.949> big<00:01:02.190> deal<00:01:02.460> right<00:01:02.789> well<00:01:03.359> maybe<00:01:03.539> not<00:01:03.840> if<00:01:04.019> you

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
no big deal right well maybe not if you

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.560 
no big deal right well maybe not if you
ate<00:01:04.320> the<00:01:04.729> appropriate<00:01:05.729> amount<00:01:05.909> of<00:01:05.970> sugar<00:01:06.210> but

ate the appropriate amount of sugar but

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.660 
ate the appropriate amount of sugar but
we're<00:01:06.780> eating<00:01:07.229> 40<00:01:07.680> pounds<00:01:08.070> more<00:01:08.220> sugar

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
that causes major problems because too

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.350 
that causes major problems because too
much<00:01:13.020> insulin<00:01:13.409> too<00:01:13.950> much<00:01:14.130> sugar<00:01:14.400> tells<00:01:15.150> you<00:01:15.270> to

do what shockingly store more fat that's

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.070 
do what shockingly store more fat that's
why<00:01:20.159> we<00:01:20.369> grow<00:01:20.580> these<00:01:20.759> big<00:01:21.180> bellies<00:01:21.630> you're
