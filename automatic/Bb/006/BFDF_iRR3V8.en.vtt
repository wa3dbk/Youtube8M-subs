a few<00:00:00.240> other<00:00:00.390> features<00:00:00.659> we<00:00:01.140> want<00:00:01.319> to<00:00:01.380> talk

00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:01.500 
a few other features we want to talk

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:04.849 
a few other features we want to talk
about<00:00:01.560> with<00:00:02.100> a<00:00:02.790> deep<00:00:03.449> circulation<00:00:04.170> where

00:00:04.849 --> 00:00:04.859 
about with a deep circulation where

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:07.519 
about with a deep circulation where
different<00:00:05.520> water<00:00:05.700> masses<00:00:05.940> meet<00:00:06.629> we<00:00:07.080> saw<00:00:07.350> a

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:07.529 
different water masses meet we saw a

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:09.110 
different water masses meet we saw a
little<00:00:07.680> bit<00:00:07.859> of<00:00:07.919> this<00:00:08.160> when<00:00:08.460> we<00:00:08.610> saw<00:00:09.059> the

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.120 
little bit of this when we saw the

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.000 
little bit of this when we saw the
satellite<00:00:09.719> images<00:00:10.139> where<00:00:10.380> the<00:00:10.559> Labrador

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.010 
satellite images where the Labrador

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:13.039 
satellite images where the Labrador
Current<00:00:11.309> meets<00:00:11.700> the<00:00:11.849> Gulf<00:00:12.059> Stream<00:00:12.150> we're<00:00:12.840> two

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
Current meets the Gulf Stream we're two

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:15.049 
Current meets the Gulf Stream we're two
different<00:00:13.139> water<00:00:13.500> masses<00:00:13.740> meet<00:00:14.400> that's

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
different water masses meet that's

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:17.300 
different water masses meet that's
called<00:00:15.420> a<00:00:15.660> front<00:00:16.049> the<00:00:16.320> same<00:00:16.560> kind<00:00:16.949> of<00:00:17.100> thing

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
called a front the same kind of thing

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.740 
called a front the same kind of thing
happens<00:00:17.910> in<00:00:19.189> other<00:00:20.189> parts<00:00:20.580> of<00:00:20.730> the<00:00:21.060> ocean<00:00:21.090> the

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
happens in other parts of the ocean the

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.109 
happens in other parts of the ocean the
Antarctic<00:00:22.289> polar<00:00:22.650> front<00:00:23.070> so<00:00:23.400> remember<00:00:23.820> we<00:00:23.880> saw

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
Antarctic polar front so remember we saw

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.720 
Antarctic polar front so remember we saw
that<00:00:24.300> as<00:00:24.510> the<00:00:24.980> boundary<00:00:25.980> the<00:00:26.250> southern

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
that as the boundary the southern

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.490 
that as the boundary the southern
boundary<00:00:27.180> of<00:00:27.269> the<00:00:27.570> Antarctic<00:00:27.900> circumpolar

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
boundary of the Antarctic circumpolar

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.550 
boundary of the Antarctic circumpolar
current<00:00:29.099> so<00:00:29.580> go<00:00:29.760> back<00:00:29.939> to<00:00:30.150> the<00:00:30.240> picture<00:00:30.480> of<00:00:31.199> the

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
current so go back to the picture of the

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.380 
current so go back to the picture of the
image<00:00:31.920> of<00:00:32.189> the<00:00:32.399> Antarctic<00:00:33.030> circumpolar

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
image of the Antarctic circumpolar

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:34.670 
image of the Antarctic circumpolar
current<00:00:33.840> and<00:00:34.110> you'll<00:00:34.200> see<00:00:34.380> that<00:00:34.410> that

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
current and you'll see that that

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.130 
current and you'll see that that
southern<00:00:35.040> boundary<00:00:35.430> is<00:00:35.640> called<00:00:36.270> the<00:00:36.690> polar

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
southern boundary is called the polar

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.049 
southern boundary is called the polar
front<00:00:37.620> we<00:00:38.040> also<00:00:38.219> had<00:00:38.579> a<00:00:38.820> northern<00:00:39.480> one<00:00:40.079> the

00:00:41.049 --> 00:00:41.059 
front we also had a northern one the

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:44.900 
front we also had a northern one the
subpolar<00:00:42.059> front<00:00:42.780> okay<00:00:43.500> so<00:00:44.399> fronts<00:00:44.789> are

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
subpolar front okay so fronts are

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.900 
subpolar front okay so fronts are
important<00:00:45.420> just<00:00:45.930> they<00:00:46.200> tend<00:00:46.500> to<00:00:46.559> be<00:00:46.739> as<00:00:47.460> i<00:00:47.670> said

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
important just they tend to be as i said

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.660 
important just they tend to be as i said
before<00:00:48.030> places<00:00:48.899> that<00:00:49.110> stimulate

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:49.670 
before places that stimulate

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:51.979 
before places that stimulate
productivity<00:00:50.670> and<00:00:50.879> that's<00:00:51.360> true<00:00:51.660> for<00:00:51.899> the

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
productivity and that's true for the

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:57.250 
productivity and that's true for the
antarctic<00:00:52.379> polar<00:00:52.620> front<00:00:52.949> as<00:00:53.129> well<00:00:53.699> and<00:00:54.629> also

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:57.260 
antarctic polar front as well and also

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:00.920 
antarctic polar front as well and also
ocean<00:00:58.260> ocean<00:00:58.829> features<00:00:59.489> such<00:00:59.879> as<00:00:59.930> geographic

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
ocean ocean features such as geographic

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.229 
ocean ocean features such as geographic
or<00:01:01.109> geologic<00:01:01.680> features<00:01:02.010> excuse<00:01:02.430> me<00:01:02.579> such<00:01:03.059> as

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
or geologic features excuse me such as

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.810 
or geologic features excuse me such as
oceanic<00:01:03.899> ridges<00:01:04.170> and<00:01:04.500> of<00:01:05.040> course<00:01:05.250> trenches

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
oceanic ridges and of course trenches

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.630 
oceanic ridges and of course trenches
they<00:01:06.210> can<00:01:06.420> limit<00:01:06.860> flows<00:01:07.860> it<00:01:08.250> can<00:01:08.430> cause

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
they can limit flows it can cause

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.310 
they can limit flows it can cause
changes<00:01:08.939> in<00:01:09.180> flow<00:01:09.510> system<00:01:09.930> these<00:01:10.080> will

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
changes in flow system these will

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.160 
changes in flow system these will
restrict<00:01:11.100> or<00:01:11.430> actually<00:01:12.150> alter<00:01:12.689> the

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
restrict or actually alter the

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.350 
restrict or actually alter the
circulation<00:01:13.890> of<00:01:13.920> the<00:01:14.159> deep<00:01:14.369> ocean<00:01:14.760> as<00:01:14.939> well<00:01:15.150> we

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
circulation of the deep ocean as well we

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.300 
circulation of the deep ocean as well we
looked<00:01:15.659> at<00:01:15.810> some<00:01:16.049> of<00:01:16.080> that<00:01:16.310> Mediterranean

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
looked at some of that Mediterranean

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.300 
looked at some of that Mediterranean
outflow<00:01:17.790> water<00:01:18.060> earlier<00:01:18.659> and<00:01:18.900> actually<00:01:19.619> out

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
outflow water earlier and actually out

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.830 
outflow water earlier and actually out
of<00:01:20.369> that<00:01:21.150> are<00:01:22.549> Eddie's<00:01:23.549> so<00:01:24.540> that

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
of that are Eddie's so that

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.660 
of that are Eddie's so that
Mediterranean<00:01:25.560> outflow<00:01:26.100> water<00:01:26.369> actually

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
Mediterranean outflow water actually

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.370 
Mediterranean outflow water actually
comes<00:01:27.330> out<00:01:28.100> spinning<00:01:29.100> what<00:01:30.060> informs<00:01:30.810> what<00:01:31.020> are

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
comes out spinning what informs what are

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.030 
comes out spinning what informs what are
called<00:01:31.670> middies<00:01:32.670> for<00:01:33.299> Mediterranean<00:01:34.079> Eddie's

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
called middies for Mediterranean Eddie's

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.390 
called middies for Mediterranean Eddie's
so<00:01:36.000> not<00:01:36.420> only<00:01:36.450> do<00:01:36.810> we<00:01:36.930> have<00:01:36.960> Eddie's<00:01:37.770> but<00:01:38.280> we

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
so not only do we have Eddie's but we

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:44.420 
so not only do we have Eddie's but we
also<00:01:38.549> have<00:01:38.880> medis<00:01:39.750> too<00:01:40.560> fun<00:01:40.770> word<00:01:42.829> here<00:01:43.829> as<00:01:44.070> I

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
also have medis too fun word here as I

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.280 
also have medis too fun word here as I
said<00:01:44.700> earlier<00:01:44.850> the<00:01:45.659> figure<00:01:45.930> that<00:01:46.049> we<00:01:46.110> saw

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
said earlier the figure that we saw

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.499 
said earlier the figure that we saw
earlier<00:01:46.500> so<00:01:46.860> here's<00:01:47.100> the<00:01:47.220> Antartic<00:01:47.520> front<00:01:47.939> the

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
earlier so here's the Antartic front the

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:52.219 
earlier so here's the Antartic front the
boundary<00:01:48.869> between<00:01:48.920> very<00:01:49.920> cold<00:01:50.369> of<00:01:51.110> places<00:01:52.110> of

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
boundary between very cold of places of

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.469 
boundary between very cold of places of
formation<00:01:52.770> of<00:01:52.979> Antarctic<00:01:53.640> bottom<00:01:53.820> water<00:01:54.030> and

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
formation of Antarctic bottom water and

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:58.969 
formation of Antarctic bottom water and
other<00:01:55.189> Antarctic<00:01:56.189> water<00:01:56.670> masses<00:01:57.329> a<00:01:57.750> very<00:01:58.469> rich

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
other Antarctic water masses a very rich

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:02.560 
other Antarctic water masses a very rich
region<00:01:59.719> biologically<00:02:00.719> also<00:02:01.170> because<00:02:01.560> this<00:02:01.829> is

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:02.570 
region biologically also because this is

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:05.539 
region biologically also because this is
generally<00:02:03.570> where<00:02:03.780> we<00:02:03.960> find<00:02:04.229> sea<00:02:04.890> ice<00:02:05.070> the

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
generally where we find sea ice the

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:09.979 
generally where we find sea ice the
extent<00:02:05.969> of<00:02:06.090> sea<00:02:06.329> ice<00:02:06.360> is<00:02:06.860> also<00:02:08.599> limited<00:02:09.599> is

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
extent of sea ice is also limited is

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:13.460 
extent of sea ice is also limited is
also<00:02:10.319> demarcated<00:02:11.129> by<00:02:11.400> the<00:02:11.700> Antarctic<00:02:12.450> front

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
also demarcated by the Antarctic front

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.410 
also demarcated by the Antarctic front
the<00:02:13.620> circumpolar<00:02:14.100> current<00:02:14.460> also<00:02:14.820> of<00:02:15.240> course

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
the circumpolar current also of course

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:19.100 
the circumpolar current also of course
runs<00:02:15.960> further<00:02:16.530> north<00:02:17.220> as<00:02:17.580> far<00:02:18.360> north<00:02:18.570> is<00:02:18.780> 40

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
runs further north as far north is 40

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:22.160 
runs further north as far north is 40

there's some people that even think that

there's some people that even think that
this<00:03:46.470> type<00:03:46.830> of<00:03:46.860> feature<00:03:47.340> and<00:03:47.760> the<00:03:48.510> circulation
