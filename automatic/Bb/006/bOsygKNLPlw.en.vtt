00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:05.009
 hi everyone knows would have said 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:08.040
 I hope you are well then yes 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:10.080
 I know it's been a little over fifteen 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:13.230
 days that I do not have cause this video 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:15.630
 so I apologize but I really 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.520
 have not had the time lately 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:20.580
 organize me as it was necessary for you 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.769
 video post per week really 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.350
 really sorry and in any case I you 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:28.320
 Thank you very much for being concerned 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:30.420
 of you being asked where 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.550
 I was gone but do not worry 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:35.040
 all is well it's just that I have 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:38.570
 had a lack of organization and in addition 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:42.000
 here right now it's the heat wave we've 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:45.930
 30 degrees at home it's 30 so 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:49.050
 already out and must do more and that's it 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:51.629
 it's really hard to motivate yourself 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:54.449
 to do anything so even 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:56.789
 for those to live his own life it's 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:59.760
 already difficult so it's really a 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:03.600
 little bit complicated at the moment so I 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:05.729
 sincerely apologize and but do not you 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.020
 do not worry I'll quickly get over it 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.900
 at work 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.430
 so here I'm doing a little video for 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.920
 a little bit give you of my 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:16.560
 news a little bit talk with you 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.390
 harry a little parenthesis on my 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.970
 hair because maybe that's you 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.979
 is interested in small wicks 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.390
 violets I do not know how it comes out 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:27.540
 on camera it looks like these blues but 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:29.700
 in any case it is rape and I have 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.240
 put so I used a tattoo glue 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.759
 of may be nice 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:36.040
 it is an eye cream eye here and 

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:38.619
 I'm just going to apply on 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:40.750
 some traps and that gives this so 

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:42.909
 that's what makes it possible to change what they 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:44.439
 would have a little hair without 

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:46.689
 to be forced to color 

00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:48.759
 or colorations that will damage the 

00:01:46.689 --> 00:01:51.820
 hair and then his share at the corner chan 

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:53.619
 so frankly that's great I have a 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:57.789
 Huge news to announce 

00:01:53.619 --> 00:02:00.700
 so I participated in a video clip so 

00:01:57.789 --> 00:02:03.490
 this is the clip echoes of rachel said 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:06.940
 soil so he's going out today I had 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:09.039
 posted the little teaser on instagram 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:12.010
 there a few days so you put 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:13.630
 honey here if you deliver 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:16.209
 can watch the clip 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:19.060
 so I was invited to participate 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:21.940
 with several youtube buzz so the clip 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:25.420
 actually was done to remind the 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:27.000
 black woman that's a woman really 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:29.980
 beautiful that she does not need 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:33.310
 inevitably makeup and fireworks 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:34.450
 to be beautiful so simply the 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:36.640
 black woman is a beautiful woman 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:38.859
 natural and here we have to 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:41.760
 let's be proud of that and do not 

00:02:38.859 --> 00:02:44.230
 let it actually be imprisoned in the 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:47.650
 beauty criteria in fact that the 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:51.190
 company imposes us in quotation marks 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:52.209
 that's the white rot hair 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:54.700
 said it's ca 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:57.600
 we do not need all this to be 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:03:01.150
 beautiful we have we are as we are and 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:03.340
 each has its own beauty and our 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:04.480
 natural beauty and the most beautiful that 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:07.209
 we can have 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:10.150
 so here I really thank all 

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:11.460

 it's an artist that I really had 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:27.660
 pleasure to discover so that's the fact 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:30.090

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:31.650

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:49.950
 so now let's talk about my channel 

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:52.920
 youtube as I told you there is 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:57.090
 a few months I actually gave 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:59.430
 a little trial time to try to 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:02.550
 you post two videos a week so 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:04.980
 videos actually making videos 

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:08.460
 go with special days so 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:11.760
 it was Wednesday and Saturday at 5 pm 

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:13.530
 yes that's right here so I had 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:15.300
 not officially announced because 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:17.070
 exactly day is to see if 

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:18.810
 I liked to hold and if I went 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:20.850
 get to organize me as a family 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:23.780
 and I shut myself up there I got 

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:26.700
 realized that I can not 

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:29.100
 organize in the long run 

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:31.080
 so in fact I managed I started to 

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:33.450
 from April so April but 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:35.250
 I really managed to post you well 

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:36.750
 the videos as it should and I 

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:39.390
 started then a little bit but 

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:42.690
 blow I saw from mid June 

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:44.670
 I managed to organize no I think 

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:46.260
 that now it's better that I do not 

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:48.030
 give you no appointment because 

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:51.440
 I'm not sure I can stand 

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:53.390
 demented so I think I 'm living 

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:55.700
 do everything possible to make you 

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:57.200
 less a video a week if I arrive 

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:59.720
 I make two videos per week 

00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:02.630
 so here I think I'm going too 

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:05.600
 can come back as like what I 

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:07.550
 Before doing so I made no 

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:11.150
 a lot of late videos to make you 

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:15.800
 especially the video about my weight loss 

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:18.920
 so the update number 3 I think of 

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:22.430
 the video I decided to slim down finally the 

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:24.050
 the saga I decided to maintain so that 

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:26.780
 I'm pretty happy 

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:29.030
 so in fact I had the help of a 

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:31.210
 dietitian I was contacted by 

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:34.040
 the company very well thank you so I got 

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:36.110
 the opportunity to talk with a 

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:39.290
 dietitian and it's going pretty well 

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:41.120
 so I'll talk about it again in I you 

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:43.370
 will talk about it in a video 

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:45.650
 I think I'll do it for mid 

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:48.110
 July because anyway that's I 

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:50.270
 will wait to finish my program 

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:52.880
 with the dietician to be able to 

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:54.770
 to talk better about videos about 

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:56.690
 clothes I received I even want 

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:58.910
 to make you a look book for this summer 

00:05:56.690 --> 00:06:00.650
 but it will be earlier in August 

00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:03.110
 because here I want to do 

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:05.270
 actually filming outside and I do not think so 

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:07.340
 that I will succeed there right away 

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:07.760
 so I think it will be rather in the month 

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:11.690
 August 

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:13.310
 So here we are and we do not see each other 

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:15.260
 ideas will come as you go 

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:18.290
 and in addition also there to there are videos 

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:20.930
 to ask me also to do 

00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:23.960
 also a role bath and body works to you 

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:27.140
 do the role will be a little bit abused 

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:28.730
 because I totally cracked there in 

00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:30.410
 general it's summer that I fall for 

00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:32.840
 products bath and body works ag 

00:06:30.410 --> 00:06:35.120
 to crack well as it was so 

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:36.830
 here and but not right now 

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:38.810
 because I have not received my parcels yet 

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:41.960
 so we'll have to wait a little longer 

00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:43.760
 little and well that's it I just wanted you 

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:47.360
 to say hello to you all 

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:48.860
 I'm still here I hope 

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:51.350
 that you are not too hot because 

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:54.400
 frankly here is too hot moment 

00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:57.800
 I can honestly it is 

00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:58.940
 tiring this heat but hey that's it 

00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:00.560
 will not get lost because frankly 

00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:03.410
 minus various hot and cold breads I 

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:05.690
 I'm depressed so here I do not need 

00:07:03.410 --> 00:07:08.960
 not too much that I'm complaining either but 

00:07:05.690 --> 00:07:12.229
 I hope you are well 

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:12.880
 and I say to myself very soon and I 'm doing 

00:07:12.229 --> 00:07:15.880
 big kisses 

00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:15.880
 ciao
