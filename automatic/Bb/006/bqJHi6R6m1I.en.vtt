00:03:18.259 --> 00:03:18.269 
maintance calories you'll have to do the

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:20.330 
maintance calories you'll have to do the
math<00:03:18.480> and<00:03:18.810> look<00:03:19.049> at<00:03:19.170> some<00:03:19.320> calculators<00:03:19.890> online

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
math and look at some calculators online

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:21.979 
math and look at some calculators online
and<00:03:20.820> try<00:03:20.940> to<00:03:21.000> find<00:03:21.269> out<00:03:21.510> what<00:03:21.750> your

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:21.989

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.420 
maintenance calories are or whatever
like<00:03:24.359> that<00:03:24.630> but<00:03:25.140> just<00:03:25.350> maintenance<00:03:25.769> calories

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
like that but just maintenance calories

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:29.330 
like that but just maintenance calories
you<00:03:27.209> know<00:03:27.359> like<00:03:27.930> I<00:03:28.049> say<00:03:28.290> your<00:03:28.590> body<00:03:28.829> you're<00:03:29.160> not

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:29.340

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:30.710 
you know like I say your body you're not
gonna<00:03:29.489> gain<00:03:29.760> any<00:03:30.060> weight<00:03:30.150> and<00:03:30.480> they're<00:03:30.600> not

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:30.720 
gonna gain any weight and they're not

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:33.050 
gonna gain any weight and they're not
gonna<00:03:30.900> really<00:03:31.079> lose<00:03:31.440> any<00:03:31.769> weight<00:03:32.010> but<00:03:32.760> that's

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060 
gonna really lose any weight but that's

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:35.449 
gonna really lose any weight but that's
hypothetically<00:03:33.959> speaking<00:03:34.200> cuz<00:03:34.859> nothing's

00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:35.459 
hypothetically speaking cuz nothing's

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:37.039 
hypothetically speaking cuz nothing's
guaranteed<00:03:35.670> everybody's<00:03:36.540> body<00:03:36.810> is<00:03:36.930> different

00:03:37.039 --> 00:03:37.049 
guaranteed everybody's body is different

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:39.530 
guaranteed everybody's body is different
so<00:03:37.620> I<00:03:37.829> would<00:03:38.310> definitely<00:03:38.430> recommend<00:03:38.790> that<00:03:39.359> you

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:39.540 
so I would definitely recommend that you

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:42.470 
so I would definitely recommend that you
consume<00:03:40.470> excess<00:03:40.769> calories<00:03:41.250> and<00:03:42.000> then<00:03:42.209> do<00:03:42.450> a

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480 
consume excess calories and then do a

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:45.170 
consume excess calories and then do a
40-40-20<00:03:43.470> split<00:03:44.010> so<00:03:44.280> that<00:03:44.400> means<00:03:44.609> that<00:03:44.790> all<00:03:45.150> of

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.180 
40-40-20 split so that means that all of

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:46.940 
40-40-20 split so that means that all of
your<00:03:45.450> calories<00:03:45.720> maintenance<00:03:46.410> calories

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:46.950 
your calories maintenance calories

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:52.340 
your calories maintenance calories
you'll<00:03:47.370> be<00:03:47.519> consuming<00:03:48.200> 40%<00:03:50.030> protein<00:03:51.350> 40%

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:52.350 
you'll be consuming 40% protein 40%

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:55.220 
you'll be consuming 40% protein 40%
carbs<00:03:53.040> so<00:03:53.160> you<00:03:53.280> have<00:03:53.459> 20%<00:03:53.880> fat<00:03:54.389> and<00:03:54.840> as<00:03:55.019> you<00:03:55.109> can

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.230 
carbs so you have 20% fat and as you can

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:58.099 
carbs so you have 20% fat and as you can
see<00:03:55.500> with<00:03:55.799> the<00:03:55.920> 40-40-20<00:03:56.609> split<00:03:57.060> your<00:03:57.540> protein

00:03:58.099 --> 00:03:58.109 
see with the 40-40-20 split your protein

00:03:58.109 --> 00:04:00.020 
see with the 40-40-20 split your protein
in<00:03:58.230> your<00:03:58.319> car<00:03:58.530> should<00:03:58.829> be<00:03:58.980> at<00:03:59.130> the<00:03:59.250> same<00:03:59.489> level
