welcome to my build and Clavio video of
my<00:00:03.600> new<00:00:03.810> x-ray<00:00:04.410> XP<00:00:04.890> for<00:00:05.130> one-tenth<00:00:05.790> four-wheel

00:00:06.769 --> 00:00:06.779 
my new x-ray XP for one-tenth four-wheel

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:09.589 
my new x-ray XP for one-tenth four-wheel
drive<00:00:07.080> buggy<00:00:07.639> here<00:00:08.639> you<00:00:08.760> can<00:00:08.970> see<00:00:09.269> all<00:00:09.540> the

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:09.599 
drive buggy here you can see all the

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:13.009 
drive buggy here you can see all the
parts<00:00:10.200> that<00:00:10.260> I<00:00:10.530> in<00:00:10.590> the<00:00:10.830> box<00:00:11.480> the<00:00:12.480> first<00:00:12.780> step

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
parts that I in the box the first step

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:15.890 
parts that I in the box the first step
is<00:00:13.200> building<00:00:13.620> the<00:00:13.650> font<00:00:14.160> and<00:00:14.340> reduce<00:00:14.790> the<00:00:15.599> font

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
is building the font and reduce the font

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.890 
is building the font and reduce the font
is<00:00:16.170> filled<00:00:16.500> with<00:00:16.789> 10,000<00:00:17.789> so<00:00:18.330> we<00:00:18.570> have<00:00:18.720> with

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
is filled with 10,000 so we have with

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.320 
is filled with 10,000 so we have with
5000<00:00:19.680> Devoy<00:00:20.420> the<00:00:21.420> differ<00:00:21.810> comes<00:00:22.350> with<00:00:22.470> the<00:00:22.680> kit

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:23.330 
5000 Devoy the differ comes with the kit

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:26.900 
5000 Devoy the differ comes with the kit
so<00:00:24.330> next<00:00:24.570> step<00:00:24.750> is<00:00:25.140> building<00:00:25.800> the<00:00:25.830> font<00:00:26.340> and<00:00:26.550> we

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
so next step is building the font and we

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.740 
so next step is building the font and we
are<00:00:27.060> sensual<00:00:27.570> transmission<00:00:28.730> after<00:00:29.730> third<00:00:30.029> the

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
are sensual transmission after third the

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.250 
are sensual transmission after third the
front<00:00:31.109> and<00:00:31.349> rear<00:00:31.560> suspension<00:00:32.309> is<00:00:32.460> installed

what wound in Germany it's a clay twerk
the<00:01:58.530> surface<00:01:59.070> was<00:01:59.310> a<00:01:59.340> little<00:01:59.790> bit<00:02:00.000> wet<00:02:00.240> and

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
the surface was a little bit wet and

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:03.920 
the surface was a little bit wet and
bumpy<00:02:01.320> is<00:02:01.380> equipped<00:02:01.890> was<00:02:02.189> low<00:02:02.430> to<00:02:02.490> medium<00:02:02.930> it

was<00:02:04.229> my<00:02:04.439> first<00:02:04.710> race<00:02:05.040> ever<00:02:05.310> was<00:02:05.700> a

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
was my first race ever was a

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:08.330 
was my first race ever was a
four-wheeled<00:02:06.509> wife<00:02:06.780> buggy<00:02:07.140> and<00:02:07.439> so<00:02:07.979> I<00:02:08.009> made

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
four-wheeled wife buggy and so I made

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.790 
four-wheeled wife buggy and so I made
some<00:02:08.580> small<00:02:08.849> mistakes<00:02:09.330> the<00:02:10.050> power<00:02:10.289> of<00:02:10.410> sea<00:02:10.470> is

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
some small mistakes the power of sea is

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.430 
some small mistakes the power of sea is
small<00:02:11.160> cars

so<00:02:12.710> much<00:02:13.070> that<00:02:13.400> it<00:02:13.580> can<00:02:13.820> happen<00:02:14.030> very<00:02:14.480> easily

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:14.660 
so much that it can happen very easily

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:24.530 
so much that it can happen very easily
is<00:02:15.200> that<00:02:15.380> you<00:02:15.590> over<00:02:15.830> jumps<00:02:16.370> a<00:02:16.490> chance<00:02:16.730> lucky<00:02:17.150> Oh

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:27.869 

so<00:02:25.540> standard<00:02:25.989> setup<00:02:26.260> did<00:02:26.890> not<00:02:27.099> work<00:02:27.459> very<00:02:27.489> well

00:02:27.869 --> 00:02:27.879 
so standard setup did not work very well

00:02:27.879 --> 00:02:30.660 
so standard setup did not work very well
at<00:02:28.330> the<00:02:28.569> first<00:02:28.870> ways<00:02:29.140> the<00:02:29.920> car<00:02:30.160> was<00:02:30.430> very

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:30.670 
at the first ways the car was very

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:33.180 
at the first ways the car was very
difficult<00:02:31.269> to<00:02:31.420> drive<00:02:31.660> for<00:02:32.410> the<00:02:32.500> second<00:02:32.950> ways

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:33.190 
difficult to drive for the second ways

told me the last ways was driven into
the<00:03:08.079> other<00:03:08.379> direction<00:03:08.879> which<00:03:09.879> was<00:03:10.150> not<00:03:10.450> very

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:10.660 
the other direction which was not very

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:13.050 
the other direction which was not very
easy<00:03:10.870> because<00:03:11.500> the<00:03:11.860> track<00:03:12.099> is<00:03:12.280> not<00:03:12.370> really

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:13.060 
easy because the track is not really

especially the big double jon was very

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:22.619 
especially the big double jon was very
difficult<00:03:20.019> so<00:03:20.590> first<00:03:20.920> by<00:03:21.220> was<00:03:21.700> successful<00:03:22.390> as
