00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:21.820 
kind of the same and and that's a big

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:24.720 
kind of the same and and that's a big
problem<00:02:22.150> what<00:02:22.900> happens<00:02:23.470> when<00:02:24.040> that<00:02:24.190> happens

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:24.730 
problem what happens when that happens

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:26.910 
problem what happens when that happens
is<00:02:25.120> what<00:02:25.390> it<00:02:25.570> is<00:02:25.750> the<00:02:26.020> horse<00:02:26.260> is<00:02:26.410> on<00:02:26.530> the<00:02:26.680> left

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
is what it is the horse is on the left

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:30.630 
is what it is the horse is on the left
lead<00:02:27.220> but<00:02:27.910> if<00:02:28.030> he<00:02:28.210> leans<00:02:28.540> to<00:02:29.410> the<00:02:29.440> right<00:02:29.640> when

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:30.640 
lead but if he leans to the right when

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:32.460 
lead but if he leans to the right when
you're<00:02:30.790> shaping<00:02:31.270> him<00:02:31.420> up<00:02:31.600> over<00:02:31.870> here<00:02:32.110> to<00:02:32.350> the

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:32.470 
you're shaping him up over here to the

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:36.170 
you're shaping him up over here to the
right<00:02:32.710> if<00:02:33.100> he<00:02:33.610> if<00:02:33.910> he<00:02:33.940> if<00:02:34.480> he<00:02:34.810> if<00:02:35.110> he<00:02:35.290> picks<00:02:35.860> up

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
right if he if he if he if he picks up

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.910 
right if he if he if he if he picks up
then<00:02:37.180> he's<00:02:37.330> going<00:02:37.480> to<00:02:37.540> do<00:02:37.690> it<00:02:37.780> correctly<00:02:38.320> but

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:38.920 
then he's going to do it correctly but

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:40.800 
then he's going to do it correctly but
what<00:02:39.130> happens<00:02:39.550> most<00:02:39.850> of<00:02:40.000> the<00:02:40.060> time<00:02:40.150> is<00:02:40.630> when<00:02:40.780> we

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:40.810 
what happens most of the time is when we

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:43.650 
what happens most of the time is when we
shape<00:02:41.230> our<00:02:41.470> horses<00:02:41.860> they<00:02:42.490> shape<00:02:42.820> flat<00:02:43.240> to<00:02:43.540> the

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:43.660 
shape our horses they shape flat to the

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:45.780 
shape our horses they shape flat to the
ground<00:02:43.960> they<00:02:44.290> shaped<00:02:44.620> like<00:02:44.890> this<00:02:45.160> right<00:02:45.490> here

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:45.790 
ground they shaped like this right here

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:47.850 
ground they shaped like this right here
then<00:02:46.000> they<00:02:46.450> make<00:02:46.660> a<00:02:46.690> lateral<00:02:47.200> move

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:47.860 
then they make a lateral move

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:50.160 
then they make a lateral move
they<00:02:48.190> don't<00:02:48.370> make<00:02:48.520> an<00:02:48.700> up<00:02:48.910> move<00:02:49.240> up<00:02:49.540> and

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:50.170 
they don't make an up move up and

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:52.740 
they don't make an up move up and

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:12.030 
talking about if I'm in the left lead
got<00:03:09.400> your<00:03:09.580> inside<00:03:09.970> line<00:03:10.270> outside<00:03:11.200> line<00:03:11.500> okay

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:12.040 
got your inside line outside line okay

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:15.210 
got your inside line outside line okay
this<00:03:12.700> right<00:03:12.970> line<00:03:13.330> over<00:03:13.720> here<00:03:14.040> doesn't<00:03:15.040> get<00:03:15.160> a

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:15.220 
this right line over here doesn't get a

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:17.280 
this right line over here doesn't get a
lot<00:03:15.490> of<00:03:15.640> attention<00:03:16.240> because<00:03:16.600> it's<00:03:16.990> on<00:03:17.140> the

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:17.290 
lot of attention because it's on the

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:19.229 
lot of attention because it's on the
rail<00:03:17.530> so<00:03:17.980> we<00:03:18.130> always<00:03:18.280> figure<00:03:18.730> the<00:03:18.850> rail<00:03:19.060> is

00:03:19.229 --> 00:03:19.239 
rail so we always figure the rail is

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:20.610 
rail so we always figure the rail is
going<00:03:19.390> to<00:03:19.450> take<00:03:19.660> care<00:03:19.930> of<00:03:19.959> that<00:03:20.170> but<00:03:20.350> what<00:03:20.500> that

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:20.620 
going to take care of that but what that

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:22.440 
going to take care of that but what that
horse<00:03:20.890> can<00:03:21.040> do<00:03:21.220> is<00:03:21.370> he<00:03:21.519> can<00:03:21.640> lean<00:03:21.910> over<00:03:21.940> into

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:22.450 
horse can do is he can lean over into

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:24.870 
horse can do is he can lean over into
the<00:03:22.750> rail<00:03:22.989> and<00:03:23.290> then<00:03:24.040> he<00:03:24.160> kind<00:03:24.370> of<00:03:24.430> goes<00:03:24.610> down

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:24.880 
the rail and then he kind of goes down

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:26.940 
the rail and then he kind of goes down
it<00:03:25.030> like<00:03:25.180> this<00:03:25.450> right<00:03:25.630> here<00:03:26.140> instead<00:03:26.830> of

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:26.950 
it like this right here instead of

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:29.430 
it like this right here instead of
standing<00:03:27.400> up<00:03:27.550> and<00:03:27.880> getting<00:03:28.480> more<00:03:28.660> push<00:03:29.110> with

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:29.440 
standing up and getting more push with

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:31.680 
standing up and getting more push with
his<00:03:29.620> right<00:03:29.830> front<00:03:30.220> and<00:03:30.489> then<00:03:30.910> that<00:03:31.090> extends

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:31.690 
his right front and then that extends

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:33.600 
his right front and then that extends
his<00:03:31.780> left<00:03:32.050> front<00:03:32.350> and<00:03:32.440> increases<00:03:33.070> the<00:03:33.250> stride

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:33.610 
his left front and increases the stride

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:37.199 
his left front and increases the stride
up<00:03:33.880> front<00:03:34.209> and<00:03:34.420> the<00:03:34.510> left<00:03:35.100> so<00:03:36.100> the<00:03:36.790> more<00:03:37.030> he

00:03:37.199 --> 00:03:37.209 
up front and the left so the more he

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:40.410 
up front and the left so the more he
falls<00:03:37.570> like<00:03:38.170> this<00:03:38.530> look<00:03:39.250> to<00:03:39.700> the<00:03:39.820> right<00:03:40.030> the

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:40.420 
falls like this look to the right the

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:42.060 
falls like this look to the right the
longer<00:03:40.630> it's<00:03:40.900> going<00:03:41.110> to<00:03:41.200> get<00:03:41.380> see<00:03:41.769> how<00:03:41.860> my

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:42.070 
longer it's going to get see how my

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:45.030 
longer it's going to get see how my
shoulders<00:03:42.340> are<00:03:42.730> unsquare<00:03:43.320> right<00:03:44.320> here<00:03:44.650> so<00:03:45.010> I

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:45.040 
shoulders are unsquare right here so I

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:48.600 
shoulders are unsquare right here so I
can<00:03:45.340> do<00:03:45.489> this<00:03:45.730> as<00:03:45.970> I<00:03:46.540> square<00:03:46.989> my<00:03:47.260> shoulders<00:03:47.610> it

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:48.610 
can do this as I square my shoulders it

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:51.180 
can do this as I square my shoulders it
pushes<00:03:49.180> the<00:03:49.330> left<00:03:49.540> leg<00:03:49.810> forward<00:03:50.170> not<00:03:50.500> drop<00:03:50.890> the

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:51.190 
pushes the left leg forward not drop the

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:54.840 
pushes the left leg forward not drop the
inside<00:03:51.610> but<00:03:52.180> as<00:03:52.420> I<00:03:52.450> square<00:03:53.230> them<00:03:53.500> it<00:03:54.100> draws<00:03:54.519> the

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:54.850 
inside but as I square them it draws the

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:56.940 
inside but as I square them it draws the
right<00:03:55.090> leg<00:03:55.420> back<00:03:55.720> and<00:03:56.080> pushes<00:03:56.380> the<00:03:56.500> left<00:03:56.739> leg

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:56.950 
right leg back and pushes the left leg

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:00.060 
right leg back and pushes the left leg
forward<00:03:57.310> and<00:03:57.580> creates<00:03:58.269> that<00:03:58.630> that<00:03:59.290> push<00:03:59.650> and

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:00.070 
forward and creates that that push and

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:02.670 
forward and creates that that push and
that's<00:04:00.730> stride<00:04:01.180> and<00:04:01.600> then<00:04:01.930> that<00:04:02.050> creates<00:04:02.350> the

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:02.680 
that's stride and then that creates the

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:05.070 
that's stride and then that creates the
split<00:04:03.040> and<00:04:03.280> the<00:04:03.340> definition<00:04:04.060> up<00:04:04.209> front<00:04:04.510> just

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:05.080 
split and the definition up front just

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:07.590 
split and the definition up front just
like<00:04:05.290> behind<00:04:05.550> behind<00:04:06.550> you've<00:04:07.060> got<00:04:07.239> the<00:04:07.390> right

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:07.600 
like behind behind you've got the right

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:09.840 
like behind behind you've got the right
leg<00:04:07.870> pushing<00:04:08.410> the<00:04:08.620> left<00:04:08.830> leg<00:04:09.100> driving<00:04:09.670> you've

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:09.850 
leg pushing the left leg driving you've

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:11.729 
leg pushing the left leg driving you've
got<00:04:10.000> to<00:04:10.120> have<00:04:10.239> a<00:04:10.269> split<00:04:10.600> you<00:04:11.200> don't<00:04:11.410> want<00:04:11.590> them

00:04:11.729 --> 00:04:11.739 
got to have a split you don't want them

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:13.470 
got to have a split you don't want them
looking<00:04:12.010> like<00:04:12.070> they're<00:04:12.489> together<00:04:12.700> and<00:04:13.180> taking

to<00:04:20.530> push<00:04:20.830> stride<00:04:21.789> push<00:04:22.570> stride<00:04:23.350> the<00:04:23.680> back<00:04:23.919> leg

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:24.250 
to push stride push stride the back leg

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:26.820 
to push stride push stride the back leg
the<00:04:24.280> right<00:04:24.729> leg<00:04:25.020> pushes<00:04:26.020> left

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:26.830 
the right leg pushes left

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:29.429 
the right leg pushes left
big<00:04:26.919> strides<00:04:27.280> right<00:04:27.970> leg<00:04:28.270> push<00:04:28.659> left<00:04:29.169> leg

big strides right leg push left leg

00:04:29.439 --> 00:04:31.740 
big strides right leg push left leg
stride<00:04:29.860> so<00:04:30.520> it's<00:04:30.639> all<00:04:30.819> the<00:04:31.030> Saints<00:04:31.419> the<00:04:31.539> same

look bring it over here just tip his eye
right<00:05:02.319> there<00:05:02.400> but<00:05:03.400> but<00:05:03.729> it's<00:05:03.879> easier<00:05:04.300> for<00:05:04.599> him

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:04.900 
right there but but it's easier for him

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:08.040 
right there but but it's easier for him
to<00:05:05.310> just<00:05:06.310> move<00:05:06.580> like<00:05:06.909> this<00:05:07.270> across<00:05:07.780> in<00:05:08.020> his

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:08.050 
to just move like this across in his

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:10.740 
to just move like this across in his
shoulders<00:05:08.710> to<00:05:08.860> shift<00:05:09.159> his<00:05:09.400> shoulders<00:05:10.030> when<00:05:10.659> he

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:10.750 
shoulders to shift his shoulders when he

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:13.110 
shoulders to shift his shoulders when he
wants<00:05:10.990> to<00:05:11.080> look<00:05:11.319> at<00:05:11.560> me<00:05:11.740> just<00:05:12.190> make<00:05:12.460> a<00:05:12.490> shoulder

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:13.120 
wants to look at me just make a shoulder

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:15.420 
wants to look at me just make a shoulder
shift<00:05:13.419> instead<00:05:14.139> of<00:05:14.469> my<00:05:14.590> head<00:05:14.770> instead<00:05:15.129> of

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:15.430 
shift instead of my head instead of

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:18.990 
shift instead of my head instead of
holding<00:05:16.240> this<00:05:16.780> outside<00:05:17.379> line<00:05:17.740> and<00:05:18.190> make<00:05:18.729> him

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:19.000 
holding this outside line and make him

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.019 
holding this outside line and make him
bring<00:05:19.360> his<00:05:19.690> neck<00:05:20.139> to<00:05:20.620> me<00:05:20.800> not<00:05:21.340> his<00:05:21.550> shoulders

00:05:22.019 --> 00:05:22.029 
bring his neck to me not his shoulders

00:05:22.029 --> 00:05:24.269 
bring his neck to me not his shoulders
it's<00:05:22.389> a<00:05:22.539> lot<00:05:22.690> easier<00:05:23.139> for<00:05:23.349> him<00:05:23.469> to<00:05:23.650> break<00:05:23.919> and

00:05:24.269 --> 00:05:24.279 
it's a lot easier for him to break and

00:05:24.279 --> 00:05:26.760 
it's a lot easier for him to break and
do<00:05:24.400> this<00:05:24.750> than<00:05:25.750> it<00:05:25.900> is<00:05:26.050> for<00:05:26.289> them<00:05:26.379> to<00:05:26.469> stay

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:26.770 
do this than it is for them to stay
