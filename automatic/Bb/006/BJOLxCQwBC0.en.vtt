00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:00.610 
that's completely abandoned well I don't

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:02.159 
that's completely abandoned well I don't
want<00:06:00.789> to<00:06:00.909> be<00:06:01.000> playing<00:06:01.270> as<00:06:01.629> the<00:06:01.659> arbiter

00:06:02.159 --> 00:06:02.169 
want to be playing as the arbiter

00:06:02.169 --> 00:06:04.170 
want to be playing as the arbiter
through<00:06:02.349> half<00:06:02.529> the<00:06:02.560> game<00:06:02.919> at<00:06:03.189> the<00:06:03.339> same<00:06:03.550> time<00:06:03.849> I

00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:04.180 
through half the game at the same time I

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:05.700 
through half the game at the same time I
don't<00:06:04.479> want<00:06:04.689> that<00:06:04.960> storyline<00:06:05.379> to<00:06:05.620> be

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:05.710 
don't want that storyline to be

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:07.559 
don't want that storyline to be
completely<00:06:06.219> dropped<00:06:06.610> and<00:06:06.879> it<00:06:07.060> really<00:06:07.210> feels

00:06:07.559 --> 00:06:07.569 
completely dropped and it really feels

00:06:07.569 --> 00:06:09.629 
completely dropped and it really feels
like<00:06:07.719> that's<00:06:08.169> what's<00:06:08.469> happened<00:06:08.830> so<00:06:09.430> if<00:06:09.550> you

00:06:09.629 --> 00:06:09.639 
like that's what's happened so if you

00:06:09.639 --> 00:06:11.309 
like that's what's happened so if you
look<00:06:09.819> at<00:06:09.939> the<00:06:10.060> story<00:06:10.360> arc<00:06:10.629> from<00:06:10.810> halo<00:06:11.139> 1

00:06:11.309 --> 00:06:11.319 
look at the story arc from halo 1

00:06:11.319 --> 00:06:13.409 
look at the story arc from halo 1
through<00:06:11.560> 2<00:06:11.800> through<00:06:12.129> 3<00:06:12.310> it<00:06:12.969> just<00:06:13.240> doesn't

00:06:13.409 --> 00:06:13.419 
through 2 through 3 it just doesn't

00:06:13.419 --> 00:06:15.480 
through 2 through 3 it just doesn't
match<00:06:13.719> up<00:06:13.750> anymore<00:06:14.259> because<00:06:14.620> it<00:06:14.949> changed<00:06:15.339> so

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:15.490 
match up anymore because it changed so

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:17.279 
match up anymore because it changed so
much<00:06:15.639> in<00:06:15.699> two<00:06:16.029> and<00:06:16.330> then<00:06:16.449> it<00:06:16.599> drops<00:06:16.930> right<00:06:17.110> back

00:06:17.279 --> 00:06:17.289 
much in two and then it drops right back

00:06:17.289 --> 00:06:19.050 
much in two and then it drops right back
to<00:06:17.439> sort<00:06:17.680> of<00:06:17.770> the<00:06:17.979> same<00:06:18.159> story<00:06:18.490> type<00:06:18.729> that<00:06:18.939> it

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:19.060 
to sort of the same story type that it

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:20.939 
to sort of the same story type that it
was<00:06:19.210> in<00:06:19.389> halo<00:06:19.659> 1<00:06:19.900> it's<00:06:20.589> a<00:06:20.650> little<00:06:20.740> bit

00:06:20.939 --> 00:06:20.949 
was in halo 1 it's a little bit

00:06:20.949 --> 00:06:22.379 
was in halo 1 it's a little bit
disconcerting<00:06:21.550> and<00:06:21.610> I<00:06:21.699> think<00:06:21.969> a<00:06:22.060> little<00:06:22.210> bit

00:06:22.379 --> 00:06:22.389 
disconcerting and I think a little bit

00:06:22.389 --> 00:06:24.149 
disconcerting and I think a little bit
of<00:06:22.509> a<00:06:22.599> disservice<00:06:22.960> for<00:06:23.259> people<00:06:23.529> who<00:06:23.710> well

00:06:24.149 --> 00:06:24.159 
of a disservice for people who well

00:06:24.159 --> 00:06:25.709 
of a disservice for people who well
maybe<00:06:24.310> they<00:06:24.520> didn't<00:06:24.729> like<00:06:24.909> being<00:06:25.210> the<00:06:25.360> arbiter

00:06:25.709 --> 00:06:25.719 
maybe they didn't like being the arbiter

00:06:25.719 --> 00:06:27.570 
maybe they didn't like being the arbiter
so<00:06:25.870> much<00:06:26.080> still<00:06:26.409> wanted<00:06:26.650> to<00:06:26.680> finish<00:06:27.129> out<00:06:27.400> that

00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:27.580 
so much still wanted to finish out that

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:30.119 
so much still wanted to finish out that
storyline<00:06:28.060> and<00:06:28.509> sort<00:06:29.349> of<00:06:29.439> the<00:06:29.529> story<00:06:29.770> of<00:06:29.949> who

00:06:30.119 --> 00:06:30.129 
storyline and sort of the story of who

00:06:30.129 --> 00:06:31.800 
storyline and sort of the story of who
the<00:06:30.250> arbiter<00:06:30.580> was<00:06:30.789> and<00:06:31.120> you<00:06:31.240> don't<00:06:31.330> get<00:06:31.629> that

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:31.810 
the arbiter was and you don't get that

00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:34.140 
the arbiter was and you don't get that
satisfaction<00:06:32.379> out<00:06:32.620> of<00:06:32.680> halo<00:06:33.009> 3<00:06:33.310> but<00:06:33.909> what<00:06:34.029> it

00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:34.150 
satisfaction out of halo 3 but what it

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:36.029 
satisfaction out of halo 3 but what it
really<00:06:34.180> boils<00:06:34.389> down<00:06:34.719> to<00:06:35.050> it's<00:06:35.440> just<00:06:35.649> that<00:06:35.830> the

00:06:36.029 --> 00:06:36.039 
really boils down to it's just that the

00:06:36.039 --> 00:06:38.550 
really boils down to it's just that the
campaign<00:06:36.610> isn't<00:06:37.089> as<00:06:37.360> fun<00:06:37.539> as<00:06:37.719> it<00:06:37.870> was<00:06:38.020> in<00:06:38.349> halo

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:38.560 
campaign isn't as fun as it was in halo

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:38.990 
campaign isn't as fun as it was in halo
