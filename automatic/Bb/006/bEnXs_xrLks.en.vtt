00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:16.920
 when you finish the joining rings 

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:21.930
 i don't know how you call them 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:23.460
 you then I have my own system that 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.670
 maybe they have many others 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:29.850
 same though I wanted to share it with you 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:32.879
 that you follow me as I do 

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:38.059
 to do question dini especially in the 

00:00:32.879 --> 00:00:41.640
 support ok I buy this thread here 

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:43.979
 which I have already shown this is from a 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:47.670
 millimeter to give you an example but of 

00:00:43.979 --> 00:00:51.690
 I usually use that really 8 thread 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:01:01.860
 blocked silver I buy it at the euro 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:01:08.010
 briko you ok and how I do it 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:13.820
 I take the wire ok 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:13.820
 let's take one end this end 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:19.460
 I make her go 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:35.600
 inside the pincers wait a 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:35.600
 point to conic like this 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:51.780
 then I tighten the pliers well and all around 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:54.929
 around which is formed weighs in wine 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:57.869
 this point I'm going to cut wait 

00:01:54.929 --> 00:02:02.219
 which says the clamp was locked between one 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:04.850
 village ok this point I'm going to 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:04.850
 to cut 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:26.950
 ok it's my thumb you did what you see 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:32.530
 it is very simple and this is the result 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:36.010
 to come also very well because you don't 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:38.950
 they see signs in short, it looks like a little ring 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:43.390
 of those bought to give up the difference 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:47.470
 obviously because these are much more 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:50.019
 these end by a millimeter so yes 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:52.060
 see ok 

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:56.349
