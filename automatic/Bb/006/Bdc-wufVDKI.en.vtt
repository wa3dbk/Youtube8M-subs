harmonica I was just playing AG Marine

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:54.950 
harmonica I was just playing AG Marine
Band<00:01:49.340> harmonica<00:01:51.950> there<00:01:53.450> you<00:01:54.450> get<00:01:54.570> the<00:01:54.690> idea

and I would encourage you to start off
with<00:02:01.470> a<00:02:01.500> G<00:02:01.979> harmonica<00:02:02.759> not<00:02:03.570> a<00:02:03.899> C<00:02:04.170> harmonica<00:02:04.920> now

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
with a G harmonica not a C harmonica now

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.160 
with a G harmonica not a C harmonica now
this<00:02:05.310> goes<00:02:06.090> back<00:02:06.450> for<00:02:06.780> me

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
this goes back for me

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.130 
this goes back for me
a<00:02:07.489> ways<00:02:08.489> with<00:02:08.910> teaching<00:02:09.450> groups<00:02:09.690> of<00:02:09.899> people

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
a ways with teaching groups of people

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.020 
a ways with teaching groups of people
and<00:02:10.619> I'll<00:02:10.860> tell<00:02:11.100> you<00:02:11.190> one<00:02:11.340> thing<00:02:11.370> if<00:02:11.790> you<00:02:11.910> get

and I'll tell you one thing if you get
in<00:02:12.150> a<00:02:12.209> room<00:02:12.420> full<00:02:12.600> of<00:02:12.660> people<00:02:13.350> especially<00:02:14.190> kids

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:15.080 
in a room full of people especially kids

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:18.020 
in a room full of people especially kids
with<00:02:16.080> a<00:02:16.410> bunch<00:02:16.620> of<00:02:16.769> C<00:02:17.010> harmonicas<00:02:17.760> and<00:02:17.970> they

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
with a bunch of C harmonicas and they

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.380 
with a bunch of C harmonicas and they
get<00:02:18.180> on<00:02:18.209> the<00:02:18.390> high<00:02:18.570> end<00:02:18.600> of<00:02:18.930> the<00:02:19.019> harmonica

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:20.390 
get on the high end of the harmonica

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:22.580 
get on the high end of the harmonica
that's<00:02:21.390> not<00:02:21.600> the<00:02:21.690> high<00:02:21.810> end<00:02:22.019> that's<00:02:22.260> the<00:02:22.350> low

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
that's not the high end that's the low

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:27.170 
that's not the high end that's the low
end<00:02:24.950> that's<00:02:25.950> a<00:02:26.070> G<00:02:26.280> harmonic<00:02:26.519> on<00:02:26.910> the<00:02:27.030> high<00:02:27.150> end

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
end that's a G harmonic on the high end

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:38.509 
end that's a G harmonic on the high end
okay<00:02:27.720> here<00:02:28.079> is<00:02:28.380> AC<00:02:28.650> harmonica<00:02:37.040> it<00:02:38.040> gets<00:02:38.280> really

00:02:38.509 --> 00:02:38.519 
okay here is AC harmonica it gets really

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:44.740 
okay here is AC harmonica it gets really
obnoxious<00:02:40.040> now<00:02:41.040> here's<00:02:41.670> the<00:02:41.820> deal<00:02:43.519> number<00:02:44.519> one

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:44.750 
obnoxious now here's the deal number one

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:47.569 
obnoxious now here's the deal number one
before<00:02:45.750> you<00:02:45.900> do<00:02:46.079> anything<00:02:46.920> else<00:02:47.190> with<00:02:47.370> the

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:47.579 
before you do anything else with the

00:02:47.579 --> 00:02:51.949 
before you do anything else with the
harmonica<00:02:48.590> learn<00:02:49.590> to<00:02:49.890> breathe<00:02:50.750> learn<00:02:51.750> to

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:51.959 
harmonica learn to breathe learn to

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:55.580 
harmonica learn to breathe learn to
breathe<00:02:52.410> through<00:02:53.280> the<00:02:53.430> instrument<00:02:54.290> if<00:02:55.290> you

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
breathe through the instrument if you

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:58.220 
breathe through the instrument if you
can<00:02:55.829> learn<00:02:56.070> how<00:02:57.000> to<00:02:57.030> breathe<00:02:57.420> through<00:02:58.079> this

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
can learn how to breathe through this

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:01.250 
can learn how to breathe through this
instrument<00:02:58.950> in<00:02:59.100> a<00:02:59.280> relaxed<00:02:59.940> way<00:03:00.000> that<00:03:00.840> is<00:03:01.079> the

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
instrument in a relaxed way that is the

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.340 
instrument in a relaxed way that is the
key<00:03:01.590> to<00:03:02.100> getting<00:03:02.340> the<00:03:02.579> tone<00:03:02.880> you<00:03:03.180> want<00:03:03.420> that<00:03:04.140> is

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:04.350 
key to getting the tone you want that is

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:07.009 
key to getting the tone you want that is
the<00:03:04.470> key<00:03:04.709> to<00:03:04.769> being<00:03:05.160> able<00:03:05.310> to<00:03:05.690> control<00:03:06.690> this

00:03:07.009 --> 00:03:07.019 
the key to being able to control this

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:09.289 
the key to being able to control this
instrument<00:03:07.680> if<00:03:07.980> you<00:03:08.400> can<00:03:08.579> control<00:03:09.090> this

00:03:09.289 --> 00:03:09.299 
instrument if you can control this

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:13.250 
instrument if you can control this
instrument<00:03:09.959> using<00:03:11.450> technique<00:03:12.450> instead<00:03:13.140> of

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 
instrument using technique instead of

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:17.420 
instrument using technique instead of
force<00:03:14.480> you<00:03:15.480> will<00:03:15.750> make<00:03:16.079> a<00:03:16.350> lot<00:03:17.100> more<00:03:17.370> progress

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 
force you will make a lot more progress

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:21.050 
force you will make a lot more progress
in<00:03:18.180> a<00:03:18.269> much<00:03:18.690> shorter<00:03:18.720> period<00:03:19.590> of<00:03:19.680> time<00:03:19.739> than<00:03:20.220> if

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060 
in a much shorter period of time than if

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:24.170 
in a much shorter period of time than if
you<00:03:21.390> start<00:03:21.870> off<00:03:22.140> the<00:03:22.650> way<00:03:22.769> so<00:03:22.829> many<00:03:23.519> harmonica

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 
you start off the way so many harmonica

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:26.630 
you start off the way so many harmonica
players<00:03:24.420> do<00:03:24.690> which<00:03:24.900> is<00:03:25.109> to<00:03:25.260> try<00:03:25.500> to<00:03:25.560> force<00:03:26.040> the

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:26.640 
players do which is to try to force the

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:29.509 
players do which is to try to force the
instrument<00:03:27.209> into<00:03:27.390> bending<00:03:27.959> a<00:03:28.050> note<00:03:28.340> now<00:03:29.340> that

00:03:29.509 --> 00:03:29.519 
instrument into bending a note now that

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:32.509 
instrument into bending a note now that
well<00:03:30.390> bit<00:03:30.810> I<00:03:31.050> played<00:03:31.379> at<00:03:31.590> the<00:03:31.709> beginning<00:03:31.860> was

00:03:32.509 --> 00:03:32.519 
well bit I played at the beginning was

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:33.510 
well bit I played at the beginning was
just

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:33.520 
just

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:36.360 
just
just<00:03:33.880> off<00:03:34.030> the<00:03:34.060> top<00:03:34.210> of<00:03:34.390> my<00:03:34.570> head<00:03:34.960> and<00:03:35.620> my<00:03:36.070> goal

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:36.370 
just off the top of my head and my goal

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:38.880 
just off the top of my head and my goal
was<00:03:36.400> to<00:03:36.640> play<00:03:37.060> something<00:03:37.660> that<00:03:38.050> didn't<00:03:38.410> have

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:38.890 
was to play something that didn't have

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:43.740 
was to play something that didn't have
any<00:03:39.070> bent<00:03:39.670> notes<00:03:39.940> in<00:03:40.180> it<00:03:40.500> and<00:03:42.420> one<00:03:43.420> of<00:03:43.450> the

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:43.750 
any bent notes in it and one of the

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:46.530 
any bent notes in it and one of the
reasons<00:03:44.680> that<00:03:44.920> I<00:03:44.980> encouraged<00:03:45.850> people<00:03:46.060> to<00:03:46.270> do

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:46.540 
reasons that I encouraged people to do

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:49.350 
reasons that I encouraged people to do
that<00:03:46.750> off<00:03:46.930> right<00:03:47.440> off<00:03:47.620> the<00:03:48.010> bat<00:03:48.250> to<00:03:48.880> start<00:03:49.180> off

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:49.360 
that off right off the bat to start off

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:54.630 
that off right off the bat to start off
with<00:03:49.660> is<00:03:50.470> to<00:03:50.770> just<00:03:51.130> learn<00:03:51.820> how<00:03:52.600> to<00:03:53.220> relax<00:03:54.220> and

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:54.640 
with is to just learn how to relax and

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:56.310 
with is to just learn how to relax and
get<00:03:54.820> the<00:03:54.970> notes<00:03:55.210> to<00:03:55.420> come<00:03:55.600> out<00:03:55.750> now<00:03:56.080> if<00:03:56.200> you

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:56.320 
get the notes to come out now if you

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:59.760 
get the notes to come out now if you
work<00:03:56.560> on<00:03:56.770> a<00:03:56.830> G<00:03:57.570> harmonica<00:03:58.570> on<00:03:58.750> the<00:03:59.170> low<00:03:59.380> end<00:03:59.410> of

00:03:59.760 --> 00:03:59.770 
work on a G harmonica on the low end of

the harmonica you have to breathe

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:06.270 
the harmonica you have to breathe
through<00:04:03.040> this<00:04:03.250> instrument<00:04:03.640> with<00:04:04.600> a<00:04:05.280> minimum

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:06.280 
through this instrument with a minimum

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:08.100 
through this instrument with a minimum
amount<00:04:06.460> of<00:04:06.880> air<00:04:07.030> pressure<00:04:07.060> especially<00:04:07.750> at

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:08.110 
amount of air pressure especially at

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:14.820 
amount of air pressure especially at
first<00:04:12.690> to<00:04:13.690> get<00:04:13.840> the<00:04:13.990> raise<00:04:14.170> to<00:04:14.350> play<00:04:14.560> if<00:04:14.710> you

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:14.830 
first to get the raise to play if you

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:19.500 
first to get the raise to play if you
hit<00:04:15.010> it<00:04:15.070> too<00:04:15.220> hard<00:04:17.610> it's<00:04:18.610> not<00:04:18.700> gonna<00:04:18.910> work

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:19.510 
hit it too hard it's not gonna work

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:21.600 
hit it too hard it's not gonna work
now<00:04:20.110> you<00:04:20.170> can<00:04:20.530> get<00:04:20.680> away<00:04:20.770> with<00:04:20.980> that<00:04:21.130> same<00:04:21.400> air

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:21.610 
now you can get away with that same air

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:26.010 
now you can get away with that same air
pressure<00:04:23.280> I<00:04:24.280> want<00:04:24.970> to<00:04:25.030> see<00:04:25.240> harmonica<00:04:25.720> you<00:04:25.870> can

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:26.020 
pressure I want to see harmonica you can

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:27.480 
pressure I want to see harmonica you can
hit<00:04:26.140> that<00:04:26.200> pretty<00:04:26.680> hard<00:04:26.920> and<00:04:27.070> it'll<00:04:27.190> still

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:27.490 
hit that pretty hard and it'll still

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:30.300 
hit that pretty hard and it'll still
play<00:04:27.850> in<00:04:28.120> the<00:04:28.210> low<00:04:28.390> end<00:04:28.660> but<00:04:29.590> that's<00:04:29.740> not<00:04:30.130> going

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:30.310 
play in the low end but that's not going

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:33.300 
play in the low end but that's not going
to<00:04:30.400> give<00:04:30.580> you<00:04:30.700> a<00:04:30.730> good<00:04:30.880> technique<00:04:31.450> so<00:04:32.260> the<00:04:33.010> G

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:33.310 
to give you a good technique so the G

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:36.920 
to give you a good technique so the G
harmonica<00:04:34.060> is<00:04:34.240> going<00:04:34.690> to<00:04:34.990> check<00:04:35.530> your<00:04:35.980> worst

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:36.930 
harmonica is going to check your worst

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:39.000 
harmonica is going to check your worst
tendencies<00:04:37.930> when<00:04:38.350> you<00:04:38.440> first<00:04:38.680> start<00:04:38.950> playing

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:39.010 
tendencies when you first start playing

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:43.710 
tendencies when you first start playing
this<00:04:39.460> instrument<00:04:39.810> it's<00:04:40.810> it's<00:04:41.800> the<00:04:42.640> lowest<00:04:42.880> key

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:43.720 
this instrument it's it's the lowest key

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:46.280 
this instrument it's it's the lowest key
you<00:04:43.900> can<00:04:44.140> get<00:04:44.350> in<00:04:44.530> a<00:04:44.650> standard<00:04:45.250> a<00:04:45.550> set<00:04:46.030> of

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:46.290 
you can get in a standard a set of

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:48.600 
you can get in a standard a set of
harmonicas<00:04:47.290> you<00:04:47.410> can<00:04:47.530> get<00:04:47.710> lower<00:04:47.950> keys<00:04:48.310> than

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:48.610 
harmonicas you can get lower keys than

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:52.610 
harmonicas you can get lower keys than
this<00:04:49.170> but<00:04:50.170> I<00:04:50.770> think<00:04:51.220> the<00:04:51.310> G<00:04:51.550> is<00:04:51.700> a<00:04:51.730> nice

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:52.620 
this but I think the G is a nice

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:55.230 
this but I think the G is a nice
all-around<00:04:53.620> range<00:04:53.980> to<00:04:54.250> work<00:04:54.460> with<00:04:54.700> and<00:04:55.090> the

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:55.240 
all-around range to work with and the

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:57.720 
all-around range to work with and the
other<00:04:55.420> thing<00:04:55.690> about<00:04:55.810> it<00:04:56.020> is<00:04:56.320> that<00:04:56.350> you<00:04:57.340> can

00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:57.730 
other thing about it is that you can

00:04:57.730 --> 00:05:00.750 
other thing about it is that you can
start<00:04:58.210> playing<00:04:58.600> scales<00:04:59.230> and<00:04:59.770> other<00:05:00.100> things<00:05:00.520> on

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:00.760 
start playing scales and other things on

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:03.210 
start playing scales and other things on
the<00:05:00.880> top<00:05:01.150> end<00:05:01.450> of<00:05:01.600> the<00:05:01.660> harmonica<00:05:02.350> without

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:03.220 
the top end of the harmonica without

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:04.620 
the top end of the harmonica without
driving<00:05:03.550> all<00:05:03.910> the<00:05:04.120> cats<00:05:04.360> in<00:05:04.600> your

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:18.930 
you to do is to find a half-decent G

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:21.270 
you to do is to find a half-decent G
harmonica<00:05:19.930> and<00:05:20.140> then<00:05:20.320> just<00:05:20.530> start<00:05:20.770> doing<00:05:21.040> this

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:21.280 
harmonica and then just start doing this

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:23.250 
harmonica and then just start doing this
I'm<00:05:21.550> going<00:05:21.730> to<00:05:21.790> play<00:05:22.030> this<00:05:22.240> real<00:05:22.780> simple

in-breath I start the in-breath I pause
I<00:05:43.960> finish<00:05:44.830> the<00:05:45.040> in-breath<00:05:45.430> I<00:05:45.730> am<00:05:45.970> not<00:05:46.560> stopping

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:47.560 
I finish the in-breath I am not stopping

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:51.500 
I finish the in-breath I am not stopping
the<00:05:48.010> breath<00:05:48.280> with<00:05:48.610> my<00:05:48.820> tongue<00:05:49.210> like<00:05:49.870> this

working on this from day one to balance

00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:27.840 
working on this from day one to balance
the<00:06:25.780> in-breath<00:06:26.230> with<00:06:26.590> the<00:06:26.740> out-breath<00:06:26.950> you're

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:27.850 
the in-breath with the out-breath you're

00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:31.850 
the in-breath with the out-breath you're
now<00:06:28.210> working<00:06:28.570> on<00:06:28.960> one<00:06:29.350> of<00:06:29.380> the<00:06:29.620> most<00:06:29.920> important

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:31.860 
now working on one of the most important

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:34.920 
now working on one of the most important
overall<00:06:32.860> skills<00:06:33.430> for<00:06:33.880> playing<00:06:34.120> the<00:06:34.240> harmonica

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:34.930 
overall skills for playing the harmonica

00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:38.580 
overall skills for playing the harmonica
and<00:06:35.320> it<00:06:35.770> will<00:06:36.010> teach<00:06:36.700> you<00:06:37.290> technique<00:06:38.290> and

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:38.590 
and it will teach you technique and

00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:42.240 
and it will teach you technique and
control<00:06:39.190> and<00:06:39.820> it<00:06:40.630> will<00:06:40.810> also<00:06:41.050> get<00:06:41.800> you<00:06:42.010> away

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:42.250 
control and it will also get you away

00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:46.170 
control and it will also get you away
from<00:06:42.430> using<00:06:42.940> force<00:06:44.490> so<00:06:45.490> that's<00:06:45.700> it<00:06:45.940> for<00:06:46.120> now

00:06:46.170 --> 00:06:46.180 
from using force so that's it for now
