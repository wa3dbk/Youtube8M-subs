 simple that needs very few 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:46.420

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:54.220
 cooking them for today's recipe we have 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:55.660
 prepared about 200 220 grams of 

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:57.310
 spaghetti that is going to be the measure that 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:59.610
 We will use for two people 

00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:02.160
 we have an onion that we will then sting 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:07.000
 a quarter of a liter of fat to count 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:10.119
 two eggs a generous amount of 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:14.410
 ground black pepper we have also 

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:17.260
 about 180 to 200 grams of sliced ​​bacon 

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:19.420
 in taquitos and a little salt 

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:22.270
 as you will see the first thing we have done 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:24.220
 has been filling a large pot with a 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:27.910
 good amount of water to which we are going to 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:29.510
 add salt and a dash of oil 

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:31.760
 olive 

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:34.700
 then we're going to cover and we're going to put the 

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:36.710
 fire butt to boil the 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:39.290
 water after putting water to heat 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:41.630
 The first thing we are going to do is going to be 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:44.040
 catch the two eggs a container that 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:46.610
 have 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.610
 think the 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:55.750
 and two we were going to put with the 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:57.610
 eggs the cream that we had prepared 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:00.160
 with everything put in our containers 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:02.020
 let's take care of mixing it well and 

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:05.070
 debate what the egg mixes well 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:05.070
 with the cream 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:10.700
 is going to be the base of our sauce 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:13.690
 carbonara 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:18.900
 when we have everything well mixed 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:18.900
 we are going to add a pinch of salt 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:23.980
 not much because then it will come out with the 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:27.010
 bacon 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:28.599
 and we distribute them well this base for 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:30.549
 Carbonara sauce for now what we 're going 

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:33.129
 to do is going to be to reserve it and have it 

00:02:30.549 --> 00:02:34.930
 well loved while the water heats up 

00:02:33.129 --> 00:02:39.470
 let's take the opportunity to see our 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:41.000
 onion in pieces welcome 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:43.430
 We have our services here 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.340
 vegetable the onion well chopped and what 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:49.730
 that we're going to do the first thing 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:52.910
 trickle of generous oil in our 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:54.920
 pan that we are going to put to heat with 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:56.390
 the hot oil the pan first thing 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:58.750
 we will do will be to take the 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:58.750
 onion 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:06.910
 in about six minutes on high heat 

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:09.280
 we are going to see how the 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:12.240
 onion it will reach a little bit 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:12.240
 or being valued 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:16.720
 after about five minutes giving away 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:19.540
 the onion we see that there are small 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:21.879
 pieces that we are healthy and well 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:24.569
 that what we are going to do is to think 

00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:27.590
 the bacon in our pan 

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:30.180
 let's continue stirring 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:32.629
 frying everything together 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:34.920
 mixing the tonic well with baseball 

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:38.400
 meanwhile we are attentive to the pot 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:40.700
 As soon as the water breaks to boil, we'll 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:44.110
 throw them stylish 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:44.110
 at that moment 

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:47.940
 from time to time 

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:53.520
 to leave it another five or six minutes 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:56.070
 until we see what bacon is done 

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:59.580
 As you can see, the water has started to boil 

00:03:56.070 --> 00:04:03.210
 so let's go without waiting for more 

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:03.210
 the spaghettis 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:13.520
 and well you can imagine as with sb and with 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:15.800
 that onion 

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:19.090
 lowered 

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:19.090
 the truth is that it is a pleasure 

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:27.680
 watching the spaghetti water inside 

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:30.080
 then let's leave them about 9 10 minutes 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:32.780
 there are many people while leaves 

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:35.160
 bacon and onion because they add the 

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:38.170
 black pepper 

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:39.730
 perfect if you want to do it, can you? 

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:44.460
 I will follow the indications of my 

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:44.460
 fertilizer and I'll put it to the end 

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:48.010
 the onion 

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:53.840
 little by little I'm going to turn off the 

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:56.750
 fire I will take advantage of the uneven heat 

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:59.620
 of the glass ceramic and I'm going to let it 

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:59.620
 keep warm 

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:04.230
 is the couple of minutes until 

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:06.000
 that the pasta is finished after nine 

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:07.590
 minutes we already have the spaghetti and 

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.610
 let's quickly drain the and 

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:11.979
 put them back in the pot 

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:14.439
 with the withdrawal of the fire and you have 

00:05:11.979 --> 00:05:16.810
 very hot we are going to take also 

00:05:14.439 --> 00:05:20.320
 warm our keeping of the 

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:24.150
 fried liquor and onion 

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:24.150
 we are going to mix it well negative 

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:30.699
 and I still cut the mixture very warm 

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:33.009
 let's take the mixture we had 

00:05:30.699 --> 00:05:35.330
 prepared and reserved of cream and an egg 

00:05:33.009 --> 00:05:38.110
 smoothie 

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:41.210
 now very important to beat it well 

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:43.939
 remove the whole set so that with the 

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:45.979
 same heat is curdling a little bit 

00:05:43.939 --> 00:05:48.979
 the egg 

00:05:45.979 --> 00:05:48.979
 sauce 

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:55.390
 but 

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:58.420
 look how wonderful 

00:05:55.390 --> 00:06:00.460
 good is the time already with all this 

00:05:58.420 --> 00:06:03.400
 mixed you see how to express a little bit 

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:05.200
 in the mixture of egg cream and we 

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:08.770
 well distributed in our bacon and all 

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:10.900
 the sauce is the time to put the 

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:14.050
 main element in the carbonara sauce 

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:16.690
 owes its name to black pepper as well 

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:18.760
 what can we do right now 

00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:22.020
 or directly on the plates I had 

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:22.020
 added with a ball 

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:29.449
 there it is 

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:29.449
 we must see it 

00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:37.480

00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:40.129
