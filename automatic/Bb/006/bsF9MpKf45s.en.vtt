came out I've been flooded with the
press<00:02:48.290> to<00:02:48.440> detail<00:02:48.800> the<00:02:48.950> new<00:02:49.100> tools<00:02:49.370> so<00:02:49.850> let's

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:50.030 
press to detail the new tools so let's

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:52.750 
press to detail the new tools so let's
jump<00:02:50.300> right<00:02:50.420> in<00:02:50.860> this<00:02:51.860> time<00:02:52.130> around<00:02:52.280> i'll<00:02:52.670> be

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:52.760 
jump right in this time around i'll be

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:54.790 
jump right in this time around i'll be
discussing<00:02:52.910> the<00:02:53.360> pistons<00:02:53.780> now<00:02:54.380> i'm<00:02:54.500> not<00:02:54.650> going

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:54.800 
discussing the pistons now i'm not going

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:56.200 
discussing the pistons now i'm not going
to<00:02:54.860> get<00:02:55.040> into<00:02:55.190> what<00:02:55.430> you<00:02:55.520> can<00:02:55.700> make<00:02:55.820> with<00:02:55.880> these

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:56.210 
to get into what you can make with these

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:58.240 
to get into what you can make with these
that's<00:02:56.690> up<00:02:56.870> to<00:02:56.990> you<00:02:57.170> i'm<00:02:57.440> just<00:02:57.830> here<00:02:57.950> to<00:02:58.070> show

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:58.250 
that's up to you i'm just here to show

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:01.000 
that's up to you i'm just here to show
you<00:02:58.310> how<00:02:58.490> they<00:02:58.640> work<00:02:58.670> with<00:02:59.630> the<00:02:59.810> dlc<00:03:00.350> tools<00:03:00.650> you

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.010 
you how they work with the dlc tools you

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:05.260 
you how they work with the dlc tools you
get<00:03:01.130> four<00:03:01.430> Pistons<00:03:01.940> push<00:03:02.680> pull<00:03:03.680> push<00:03:04.610> slow<00:03:04.970> and

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:05.270 
get four Pistons push pull push slow and

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:07.450 
get four Pistons push pull push slow and
pull<00:03:05.810> slow<00:03:06.200> you<00:03:06.560> can<00:03:06.590> see<00:03:06.980> when<00:03:07.160> I<00:03:07.190> place<00:03:07.430> a

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:07.460 
pull slow you can see when I place a

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:08.830 
pull slow you can see when I place a
couple<00:03:07.700> in<00:03:07.910> the<00:03:08.030> environment<00:03:08.330> that<00:03:08.690> they're

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:08.840 
couple in the environment that they're

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:10.450 
couple in the environment that they're
basically<00:03:09.320> the<00:03:09.440> same<00:03:09.710> the<00:03:10.190> only<00:03:10.220> difference

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:10.460 
basically the same the only difference

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:12.670 
basically the same the only difference
is<00:03:10.880> that<00:03:10.940> the<00:03:11.240> push<00:03:11.510> start<00:03:12.110> with<00:03:12.200> the<00:03:12.320> piston

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:12.680 
is that the push start with the piston

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:14.920 
is that the push start with the piston
in<00:03:12.890> the<00:03:13.010> housing<00:03:13.400> and<00:03:13.550> the<00:03:13.580> pool<00:03:14.240> start<00:03:14.840> with

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:14.930 
in the housing and the pool start with

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:17.260 
in the housing and the pool start with
the<00:03:15.050> piston<00:03:15.380> out<00:03:15.640> usually<00:03:16.640> you're<00:03:17.000> going<00:03:17.180> to

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:17.270 
the piston out usually you're going to

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:19.180 
the piston out usually you're going to
do<00:03:17.420> your<00:03:17.600> stationary<00:03:18.230> object<00:03:18.620> to<00:03:18.710> the<00:03:18.800> housing

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:19.190 
do your stationary object to the housing

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:21.010 
do your stationary object to the housing
and<00:03:19.340> the<00:03:19.370> object<00:03:20.000> you<00:03:20.090> wish<00:03:20.210> to<00:03:20.390> be<00:03:20.510> pushed<00:03:20.780> or

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:21.020 
and the object you wish to be pushed or

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:30.220 
and the object you wish to be pushed or
pulled<00:03:21.050> to<00:03:21.650> the<00:03:21.680> piston<00:03:28.390> the<00:03:29.390> piston<00:03:29.780> has<00:03:29.930> two

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:30.230 
pulled to the piston the piston has two

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:32.590 
pulled to the piston the piston has two
main<00:03:30.440> states<00:03:30.830> you<00:03:31.040> need<00:03:31.190> to<00:03:31.280> control<00:03:31.610> first<00:03:32.330> is

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:32.600 
main states you need to control first is

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:35.290 
main states you need to control first is
physics<00:03:33.050> when<00:03:33.620> deactivated<00:03:34.490> the<00:03:34.640> piston<00:03:35.150> is

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:35.300 
physics when deactivated the piston is

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:37.120 
physics when deactivated the piston is
like<00:03:35.480> any<00:03:35.660> other<00:03:35.750> static<00:03:36.350> object<00:03:36.710> in<00:03:36.830> the<00:03:36.950> game

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:37.130 
like any other static object in the game

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:38.920 
like any other static object in the game
so<00:03:37.610> you'll<00:03:37.760> want<00:03:37.820> to<00:03:38.000> have<00:03:38.090> physics<00:03:38.510> active<00:03:38.840> at

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:38.930 
so you'll want to have physics active at

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:40.990 
so you'll want to have physics active at
all<00:03:39.080> times<00:03:39.350> if<00:03:39.560> possible<00:03:40.010> the<00:03:40.430> second<00:03:40.850> is

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:41.000 
all times if possible the second is

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.480 
all times if possible the second is
animation<00:03:41.660> with<00:03:42.080> this<00:03:42.290> active<00:03:42.740> the<00:03:43.010> piston<00:03:43.370> is

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:43.490 
animation with this active the piston is

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:45.310 
animation with this active the piston is
free<00:03:43.700> to<00:03:43.820> do<00:03:43.970> its<00:03:44.150> thing<00:03:44.240> and<00:03:44.630> we'll<00:03:44.840> move<00:03:45.020> in

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:45.320 
free to do its thing and we'll move in

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:48.490 
free to do its thing and we'll move in
and<00:03:45.470> out<00:03:45.560> until<00:03:45.800> it's<00:03:46.160> told<00:03:46.400> to<00:03:46.550> stop<00:03:47.500> the

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:48.500 
and out until it's told to stop the

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:50.260 
and out until it's told to stop the
piston<00:03:48.890> can<00:03:49.040> be<00:03:49.190> activated<00:03:49.580> with<00:03:49.850> a<00:03:49.910> trigger

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:50.270 
piston can be activated with a trigger

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:53.320 
piston can be activated with a trigger
to<00:03:50.570> do<00:03:51.050> this<00:03:51.290> have<00:03:51.830> animation<00:03:52.490> in<00:03:52.670> active<00:03:53.120> on

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:53.330 
to do this have animation in active on

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:55.420 
to do this have animation in active on
your<00:03:53.390> piston<00:03:53.990> check<00:03:54.590> animation<00:03:55.160> on<00:03:55.280> the

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:55.430 
your piston check animation on the

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:58.120 
your piston check animation on the
trigger<00:03:55.730> and<00:03:56.000> select<00:03:56.510> your<00:03:56.570> piston<00:03:57.050> now<00:03:57.650> when

00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:58.130 
trigger and select your piston now when

00:03:58.130 --> 00:03:59.710 
trigger and select your piston now when
your<00:03:58.280> writer<00:03:58.490> or<00:03:58.730> other<00:03:58.880> physics<00:03:59.270> objects

00:03:59.710 --> 00:03:59.720 
your writer or other physics objects

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:01.449 
your writer or other physics objects
passes<00:04:00.110> through<00:04:00.320> the<00:04:00.440> trigger<00:04:00.680> the<00:04:01.070> piston

00:04:01.449 --> 00:04:01.459 
passes through the trigger the piston

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:05.600 
passes through the trigger the piston
will<00:04:01.580> be<00:04:01.670> activated

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:05.610 

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:08.220 

so<00:04:06.610> that's<00:04:06.820> the<00:04:07.000> piston<00:04:07.390> in<00:04:07.510> a<00:04:07.600> nutshell<00:04:07.780> I

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:08.230 
so that's the piston in a nutshell I

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:10.470 
so that's the piston in a nutshell I
could<00:04:08.800> go<00:04:08.980> on<00:04:09.010> and<00:04:09.190> on<00:04:09.430> with<00:04:09.490> possible<00:04:10.090> uses

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:10.480 
could go on and on with possible uses

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:12.660 
could go on and on with possible uses
but<00:04:10.780> like<00:04:10.960> I<00:04:11.080> said<00:04:11.140> that's<00:04:11.710> your<00:04:12.010> job<00:04:12.280> the

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:12.670 
but like I said that's your job the

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:14.400 
but like I said that's your job the
teacher<00:04:12.910> instructs<00:04:13.660> while<00:04:13.810> the<00:04:13.960> student

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:14.410 
teacher instructs while the student

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:21.000 
teacher instructs while the student
applies<00:04:14.710> so<00:04:15.250> get<00:04:15.490> the<00:04:15.610> building<00:04:20.010> trials

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:21.010 
applies so get the building trials

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:23.250 
applies so get the building trials

have some fun yeah this time it's all

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:35.940 
have some fun yeah this time it's all
about<00:04:34.090> style<00:04:34.480> we<00:04:34.960> want<00:04:35.170> to<00:04:35.260> see<00:04:35.290> what<00:04:35.620> you<00:04:35.740> got

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:35.950 
about style we want to see what you got

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:38.370 
about style we want to see what you got
