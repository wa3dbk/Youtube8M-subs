hi<00:00:23.600> team<00:00:23.930> this<00:00:24.140> is<00:00:24.200> Chris<00:00:24.560> Abraham<00:00:25.010> from<00:00:25.190> go

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:25.430 
hi team this is Chris Abraham from go

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:27.730 
hi team this is Chris Abraham from go
math<00:00:25.640> today<00:00:26.570> we're<00:00:26.870> gonna<00:00:26.960> look<00:00:27.200> at<00:00:27.350> number

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:27.740 
math today we're gonna look at number

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:30.340 
math today we're gonna look at number
eleven<00:00:28.460> on<00:00:28.580> the<00:00:28.670> elementary<00:00:29.630> fifty-three

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:30.350 
eleven on the elementary fifty-three

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:32.980 
eleven on the elementary fifty-three
Matt<00:00:30.560> MTEL<00:00:31.220> before<00:00:32.150> we<00:00:32.240> even<00:00:32.390> flipped<00:00:32.810> the

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:32.990 
Matt MTEL before we even flipped the

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:34.570 
Matt MTEL before we even flipped the
problem<00:00:33.470> I'm<00:00:33.710> gonna<00:00:33.920> look<00:00:34.130> at<00:00:34.280> it<00:00:34.400> right<00:00:34.520> now

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:34.580 
problem I'm gonna look at it right now

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:36.130 
problem I'm gonna look at it right now
with<00:00:34.910> you<00:00:35.060> and<00:00:35.210> you're<00:00:35.300> looking<00:00:35.660> at<00:00:35.810> it<00:00:36.020> and

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:36.140 
with you and you're looking at it and

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:39.970 
with you and you're looking at it and
you<00:00:36.680> see<00:00:36.920> this<00:00:37.130> diagram<00:00:37.780> right<00:00:38.780> then<00:00:39.739> you<00:00:39.800> see

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:39.980 
you see this diagram right then you see

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:41.470 
you see this diagram right then you see
the<00:00:40.130> question<00:00:40.580> and<00:00:40.610> then<00:00:40.820> you<00:00:40.880> see<00:00:41.090> the<00:00:41.180> answer

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:41.480 
the question and then you see the answer

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:44.830 
the question and then you see the answer
what<00:00:42.140> sticks<00:00:42.470> out<00:00:42.620> for<00:00:42.980> me<00:00:43.130> right<00:00:43.160> away<00:00:43.630> is<00:00:44.630> I

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:44.840 
what sticks out for me right away is I

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:47.229 
what sticks out for me right away is I
see<00:00:45.050> absolute<00:00:45.500> value<00:00:45.860> signs<00:00:46.130> so<00:00:46.760> that's<00:00:46.970> a

00:00:47.229 --> 00:00:47.239 
see absolute value signs so that's a

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:49.750 
see absolute value signs so that's a
core<00:00:47.480> idea<00:00:47.840> that<00:00:48.140> even<00:00:48.800> before<00:00:49.220> reading<00:00:49.520> the

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:49.760 
core idea that even before reading the

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:51.940 
core idea that even before reading the
problem<00:00:50.210> and<00:00:50.390> getting<00:00:50.600> into<00:00:50.989> it<00:00:51.110> you<00:00:51.770> could

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:51.950 
problem and getting into it you could

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:53.979 
problem and getting into it you could
look<00:00:52.220> at<00:00:52.460> the<00:00:52.640> answers<00:00:53.090> and<00:00:53.360> you<00:00:53.809> could

00:00:53.979 --> 00:00:53.989 
look at the answers and you could

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:55.660 
look at the answers and you could
definitely<00:00:54.110> get<00:00:54.379> a<00:00:54.440> sense<00:00:54.530> that<00:00:54.980> hey<00:00:55.220> this

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:55.670 
definitely get a sense that hey this

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:57.820 
definitely get a sense that hey this
problem<00:00:56.089> might<00:00:56.269> have<00:00:56.449> something<00:00:56.839> to<00:00:56.960> do<00:00:57.140> maybe

00:00:57.820 --> 00:00:57.830 
problem might have something to do maybe

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:00.520 
problem might have something to do maybe
possibly<00:00:58.480> hypothetically<00:00:59.480> with<00:01:00.110> absolute

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:00.530 
possibly hypothetically with absolute

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:02.850 
possibly hypothetically with absolute
value<00:01:00.890> so<00:01:01.190> now<00:01:01.220> let's<00:01:01.580> take<00:01:01.760> a<00:01:01.790> closer<00:01:02.120> look

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:02.860 
value so now let's take a closer look

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:04.509 
value so now let's take a closer look
number<00:01:03.860> 11

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:04.519 
number 11

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:07.030 
number 11

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:07.040 
use the number line below to answer the

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:09.460 
use the number line below to answer the
question<00:01:07.400> that<00:01:07.490> follows<00:01:08.080> gives<00:01:09.080> us<00:01:09.290> this

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:09.470 
question that follows gives us this

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:12.730 
question that follows gives us this
number<00:01:09.680> line<00:01:10.010> it's<00:01:10.909> got<00:01:11.090> a<00:01:11.330> it's<00:01:11.840> got<00:01:12.020> B<00:01:12.320> it's

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:12.740 
number line it's got a it's got B it's

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:16.930 
number line it's got a it's got B it's
got<00:01:13.090> D<00:01:14.090> it's<00:01:14.390> got<00:01:14.659> zero<00:01:15.170> okay<00:01:15.920> one<00:01:16.430> negative

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:16.940 
got D it's got zero okay one negative

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:19.030 
got D it's got zero okay one negative
one<00:01:17.090> which<00:01:17.780> of<00:01:17.810> the<00:01:18.020> following<00:01:18.200> expressions

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:19.040 
one which of the following expressions

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:20.740 
one which of the following expressions
represents<00:01:19.760> the<00:01:19.909> length<00:01:20.180> of<00:01:20.450> the<00:01:20.540> line

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:20.750 
represents the length of the line

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:23.680 
represents the length of the line
segment<00:01:21.050> D<00:01:21.909> okay<00:01:22.909> so<00:01:22.970> we're<00:01:23.210> trying<00:01:23.360> to<00:01:23.479> find

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:23.690 
segment D okay so we're trying to find

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:26.860 
segment D okay so we're trying to find
the<00:01:23.780> length<00:01:23.960> of<00:01:24.229> D<00:01:24.409> here<00:01:24.800> and<00:01:25.600> then<00:01:26.600> it<00:01:26.720> gives

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:26.870 
the length of D here and then it gives

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:30.999 
the length of D here and then it gives
us<00:01:27.490> these<00:01:28.490> values<00:01:28.700> here<00:01:29.390> this<00:01:30.290> is<00:01:30.500> much<00:01:30.740> more

00:01:30.999 --> 00:01:31.009 
us these values here this is much more

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:34.959 
us these values here this is much more
of<00:01:31.130> a<00:01:31.219> classic<00:01:31.790> MTEL<00:01:32.299> problem<00:01:33.310> it<00:01:34.310> doesn't<00:01:34.820> ask

00:01:34.959 --> 00:01:34.969 
of a classic MTEL problem it doesn't ask

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:37.810 
of a classic MTEL problem it doesn't ask
you<00:01:35.420> to<00:01:35.540> solve<00:01:35.930> the<00:01:36.439> problem<00:01:36.890> it<00:01:37.310> asks<00:01:37.610> you<00:01:37.700> to

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:37.820 
you to solve the problem it asks you to

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:40.420 
you to solve the problem it asks you to
find<00:01:38.119> the<00:01:38.329> expression<00:01:38.719> that<00:01:39.500> if<00:01:39.799> you<00:01:39.979> wanted

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:40.430 
find the expression that if you wanted

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:42.370 
find the expression that if you wanted
to<00:01:40.640> you<00:01:41.030> could<00:01:41.180> go<00:01:41.329> the<00:01:41.479> extra<00:01:41.600> step<00:01:41.810> and<00:01:42.170> solve

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:42.380 
to you could go the extra step and solve

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:44.200 
to you could go the extra step and solve
it<00:01:42.500> it's<00:01:42.950> not<00:01:43.159> asking<00:01:43.579> you<00:01:43.640> to<00:01:43.670> solve<00:01:43.969> it<00:01:44.119> it's

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:44.210 
it it's not asking you to solve it it's

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:45.399 
it it's not asking you to solve it it's
just<00:01:44.420> asking<00:01:44.539> you<00:01:44.810> to<00:01:44.869> come<00:01:45.079> up<00:01:45.200> with<00:01:45.229> the

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:45.409 
just asking you to come up with the

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:47.230 
just asking you to come up with the
expression<00:01:45.530> that<00:01:46.130> would<00:01:46.610> solve<00:01:46.880> it<00:01:47.030> and

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:47.240 
expression that would solve it and

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:48.910 
expression that would solve it and
that's<00:01:47.390> actually<00:01:47.659> a<00:01:47.869> much<00:01:48.200> harder<00:01:48.500> thing<00:01:48.619> to

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:48.920 
that's actually a much harder thing to

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.240 
that's actually a much harder thing to
do<00:01:49.100> than<00:01:49.579> coming<00:01:49.880> up<00:01:50.060> with<00:01:50.119> an<00:01:50.450> answer<00:01:51.250> one

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:52.250 
do than coming up with an answer one

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:54.520 
do than coming up with an answer one
thing<00:01:52.520> too<00:01:52.909> just<00:01:52.939> to<00:01:53.270> address<00:01:53.539> this<00:01:53.840> is<00:01:54.079> how<00:01:54.469> to

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:54.530 
thing too just to address this is how to

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:58.060 
thing too just to address this is how to
deal<00:01:54.859> with<00:01:54.890> absolute<00:01:55.609> value<00:01:56.060> so<00:01:56.840> so<00:01:57.680> let's<00:01:57.890> say

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:58.070 
deal with absolute value so so let's say

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:00.190 
deal with absolute value so so let's say
we're<00:01:58.250> talking<00:01:58.670> about<00:01:58.789> we<00:01:59.630> want<00:01:59.780> to<00:01:59.930> find<00:02:00.079> the

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:00.200 
we're talking about we want to find the

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:04.179 
we're talking about we want to find the
absolute<00:02:00.350> value<00:02:01.100> of<00:02:01.130> negative<00:02:01.670> one<00:02:03.189> the

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:04.189 
absolute value of negative one the

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:06.219 
absolute value of negative one the
absolute<00:02:04.340> value<00:02:05.060> measures<00:02:05.479> the<00:02:05.630> distance<00:02:05.840> a

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:06.229 
absolute value measures the distance a

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:10.230 
absolute value measures the distance a
point<00:02:06.530> is<00:02:06.740> from<00:02:07.219> zero<00:02:07.720> so<00:02:08.720> negative<00:02:08.960> one<00:02:09.470> is

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:10.240 
point is from zero so negative one is

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:14.230 
point is from zero so negative one is
approximately<00:02:11.240> one<00:02:11.810> unit<00:02:12.320> from<00:02:13.040> zero<00:02:13.370> so<00:02:13.670> we'd

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:14.240 
approximately one unit from zero so we'd

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:15.880 
approximately one unit from zero so we'd
say<00:02:14.420> the<00:02:14.540> absolute<00:02:14.930> value<00:02:15.290> of<00:02:15.440> what<00:02:15.710> a

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:15.890 
say the absolute value of what a

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:18.940 
say the absolute value of what a
negative<00:02:16.190> one<00:02:16.580> is<00:02:16.820> one<00:02:17.620> what<00:02:18.620> about<00:02:18.830> the

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:18.950 
negative one is one what about the

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:22.110 
negative one is one what about the
absolute<00:02:19.310> value<00:02:19.610> of<00:02:19.640> one<00:02:20.290> well<00:02:21.290> again

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120 
absolute value of one well again

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.520 
absolute value of one well again
absolute<00:02:23.120> value<00:02:23.420> has<00:02:23.540> is<00:02:23.780> not<00:02:24.110> dealing<00:02:24.500> with

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530 
absolute value has is not dealing with

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:26.290 
absolute value has is not dealing with
negative<00:02:24.770> numbers<00:02:25.040> it's<00:02:25.520> just<00:02:25.760> dealing<00:02:26.000> with

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:26.300 
negative numbers it's just dealing with

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:28.870 
negative numbers it's just dealing with
the<00:02:26.510> measurement<00:02:27.410> of<00:02:27.530> that<00:02:28.070> number<00:02:28.460> that

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:28.880 
the measurement of that number that

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:32.199 
the measurement of that number that
value<00:02:29.390> from<00:02:29.660> zero<00:02:30.080> so<00:02:30.620> it's<00:02:30.770> exactly<00:02:31.280> one<00:02:31.670> unit

00:02:32.199 --> 00:02:32.209 
value from zero so it's exactly one unit

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:35.140 
value from zero so it's exactly one unit
away<00:02:32.569> from<00:02:32.810> zero<00:02:33.110> so<00:02:33.200> we'd<00:02:33.560> say<00:02:33.709> one<00:02:34.120> now<00:02:35.120> let's

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150 
away from zero so we'd say one now let's

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:36.790 
away from zero so we'd say one now let's
think<00:02:35.629> about<00:02:35.780> the<00:02:36.050> problem

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:36.800 
think about the problem

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:41.630 
think about the problem
well<00:02:37.800> it<00:02:38.640> gives<00:02:38.820> me<00:02:39.030> this<00:02:39.180> a<00:02:39.360> and<00:02:39.660> B<00:02:39.900> and<00:02:40.640> I'm

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
well it gives me this a and B and I'm

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:44.900 
well it gives me this a and B and I'm
trying<00:02:41.880> to<00:02:41.940> solve<00:02:42.180> for<00:02:42.300> D<00:02:42.630> the<00:02:43.580> best<00:02:44.580> thing<00:02:44.880> to

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910 
trying to solve for D the best thing to

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:48.250 
trying to solve for D the best thing to
do<00:02:45.270> is<00:02:45.540> to<00:02:45.840> make<00:02:46.050> this<00:02:46.230> problem<00:02:46.880> concrete

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:48.260 
do is to make this problem concrete

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:52.640 
do is to make this problem concrete
what's<00:02:49.260> a<00:02:49.380> concrete<00:02:49.970> value<00:02:50.970> for<00:02:51.300> B<00:02:51.540> and<00:02:51.870> a<00:02:52.230> that

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
what's a concrete value for B and a that

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:57.290 
what's a concrete value for B and a that
would<00:02:52.800> make<00:02:53.010> sense<00:02:53.870> well<00:02:54.870> it<00:02:55.830> looks<00:02:56.130> like<00:02:56.300> B

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:57.300 
would make sense well it looks like B

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:59.630 
would make sense well it looks like B
could<00:02:57.600> be<00:02:57.720> negative<00:02:58.110> 2<00:02:58.410> and<00:02:58.830> it<00:02:59.040> looks<00:02:59.250> like<00:02:59.340> a

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 
could be negative 2 and it looks like a

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:02.810 
could be negative 2 and it looks like a
could<00:03:00.150> be<00:03:00.330> positive<00:03:01.020> 2<00:03:01.230> and<00:03:01.470> I<00:03:02.220> think<00:03:02.430> that's<00:03:02.610> I

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:02.820 
could be positive 2 and I think that's I

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:04.520 
could be positive 2 and I think that's I
think<00:03:02.970> that's<00:03:03.240> helpful<00:03:03.600> because<00:03:03.870> if<00:03:04.170> you<00:03:04.290> said

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
think that's helpful because if you said

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:07.160 
think that's helpful because if you said
B<00:03:04.560> was<00:03:04.980> negative<00:03:05.160> 2<00:03:05.640> and<00:03:06.060> you<00:03:06.570> know<00:03:06.690> a<00:03:06.930> was

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170 
B was negative 2 and you know a was

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:09.140 
B was negative 2 and you know a was
positive<00:03:07.770> 2<00:03:07.980> then<00:03:08.430> I<00:03:08.550> don't<00:03:08.700> think<00:03:08.760> it's<00:03:09.030> hard

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
positive 2 then I don't think it's hard

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:13.720 
positive 2 then I don't think it's hard
to<00:03:09.270> say<00:03:09.360> hey<00:03:10.520> what<00:03:11.520> that's<00:03:11.820> 2<00:03:12.450> units<00:03:12.900> away<00:03:13.050> and

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:13.730 
to say hey what that's 2 units away and

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:19.150 
to say hey what that's 2 units away and
that's<00:03:14.730> 2<00:03:15.090> units<00:03:15.510> away<00:03:15.920> so<00:03:16.920> guess<00:03:17.130> what<00:03:17.400> D<00:03:18.240> is<00:03:18.270> 4

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:19.160 
that's 2 units away so guess what D is 4

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:21.890 
that's 2 units away so guess what D is 4
but<00:03:20.160> let's<00:03:20.400> see<00:03:20.580> how<00:03:20.760> you<00:03:20.790> would<00:03:21.090> use<00:03:21.330> you<00:03:21.780> know

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:21.900 
but let's see how you would use you know

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:24.140 
but let's see how you would use you know
you<00:03:21.960> substitute<00:03:22.620> it<00:03:22.740> in<00:03:22.860> to<00:03:23.160> substitute<00:03:23.970> in

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
you substitute it in to substitute in

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:26.870 
you substitute it in to substitute in
two<00:03:24.630> concrete<00:03:25.110> numbers<00:03:25.590> and<00:03:25.800> then<00:03:26.670> you're

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:26.880 
two concrete numbers and then you're

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:29.920 
two concrete numbers and then you're
gonna<00:03:27.000> solve<00:03:27.330> what's<00:03:28.320> the<00:03:28.440> absolute<00:03:28.560> value<00:03:29.310> of

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:29.930 
gonna solve what's the absolute value of

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:33.830 
gonna solve what's the absolute value of
positive<00:03:30.930> 2<00:03:31.470> I'll<00:03:31.620> just<00:03:31.800> do<00:03:32.010> 2<00:03:32.610> plus<00:03:33.570> a

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 
positive 2 I'll just do 2 plus a

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:36.980 
positive 2 I'll just do 2 plus a
negative<00:03:34.470> 2<00:03:34.880> and<00:03:35.880> what's<00:03:36.090> the<00:03:36.210> absolute<00:03:36.330> value

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:36.990 
negative 2 and what's the absolute value

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:40.460 
negative 2 and what's the absolute value
of<00:03:37.020> again<00:03:38.010> positive<00:03:38.310> 2<00:03:38.880> plus<00:03:39.780> the<00:03:40.380> absolute

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:40.470 
of again positive 2 plus the absolute

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:43.370 
of again positive 2 plus the absolute
value<00:03:40.740> of<00:03:41.070> a<00:03:41.160> negative<00:03:41.310> 2<00:03:41.760> and<00:03:42.060> the<00:03:43.050> app<00:03:43.170> and

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:43.380 
value of a negative 2 and the app and

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:47.480 
value of a negative 2 and the app and
then<00:03:43.530> this<00:03:43.740> is<00:03:43.920> just<00:03:44.160> 2<00:03:45.140> plus<00:03:46.140> the<00:03:46.830> negative<00:03:47.040> 2

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:47.490 
then this is just 2 plus the negative 2

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:50.780 
then this is just 2 plus the negative 2
and<00:03:47.730> this<00:03:48.600> is<00:03:48.660> what<00:03:49.170> the<00:03:49.410> again<00:03:50.220> absolute

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:50.790 
and this is what the again absolute

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:55.310 
and this is what the again absolute
value<00:03:51.090> of<00:03:51.150> 2<00:03:52.040> minus<00:03:53.040> the<00:03:53.640> absolute<00:03:53.760> value<00:03:54.540> of<00:03:54.750> a

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:55.320 
value of 2 minus the absolute value of a

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:57.830 
value of 2 minus the absolute value of a
negative<00:03:55.470> 2<00:03:55.920> I<00:03:56.160> do<00:03:56.910> this<00:03:57.120> from<00:03:57.300> a<00:03:57.390> lot<00:03:57.630> with

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:57.840 
negative 2 I do this from a lot with

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:00.920 
negative 2 I do this from a lot with
teachers<00:03:58.230> and<00:03:58.440> about<00:03:58.770> half<00:03:59.070> the<00:03:59.310> time<00:03:59.930> mistake

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:00.930 
teachers and about half the time mistake

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:04.370 
teachers and about half the time mistake
has<00:04:01.140> made<00:04:01.380> with<00:04:01.980> the<00:04:02.160> signs<00:04:02.459> of<00:04:02.730> the<00:04:02.820> numbers<00:04:03.380> 2

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:04.380 
has made with the signs of the numbers 2

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:07.160 
has made with the signs of the numbers 2
plus<00:04:04.980> a<00:04:05.130> negative<00:04:05.280> 2<00:04:05.520> that's<00:04:05.880> like<00:04:06.120> 2<00:04:06.420> minus<00:04:06.900> 2

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:07.170 
plus a negative 2 that's like 2 minus 2

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:10.610 
plus a negative 2 that's like 2 minus 2
now<00:04:07.680> we<00:04:07.739> get<00:04:07.980> to<00:04:08.100> zero<00:04:08.930> so<00:04:09.930> the<00:04:10.080> absolute<00:04:10.110> value

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:10.620 
now we get to zero so the absolute value

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:15.979 
now we get to zero so the absolute value
of<00:04:10.980> 0<00:04:11.130> is<00:04:11.850> just<00:04:12.360> 0<00:04:13.430> this<00:04:14.430> would<00:04:14.610> be<00:04:14.730> 2<00:04:15.090> the

00:04:15.979 --> 00:04:15.989 
of 0 is just 0 this would be 2 the

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:19.280 
of 0 is just 0 this would be 2 the
absolute<00:04:16.109> value<00:04:16.590> of<00:04:16.620> 2<00:04:16.830> is<00:04:16.859> just<00:04:17.010> 2<00:04:17.840> plus<00:04:18.840> the

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:19.290 
absolute value of 2 is just 2 plus the

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:22.880 
absolute value of 2 is just 2 plus the
absolute<00:04:19.410> value<00:04:19.650> of<00:04:20.040> 2<00:04:20.370> negative<00:04:20.940> 2<00:04:21.359> is<00:04:21.540> 2<00:04:21.890> it's

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:22.890 
absolute value of 2 negative 2 is 2 it's

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:25.600 
absolute value of 2 negative 2 is 2 it's
a<00:04:22.950> positive<00:04:23.220> 2<00:04:23.760> so<00:04:24.270> 2<00:04:24.330> plus<00:04:24.720> 2<00:04:24.990> is<00:04:25.020> 4

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:25.610 
a positive 2 so 2 plus 2 is 4

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:28.340 
a positive 2 so 2 plus 2 is 4
which<00:04:26.610> is<00:04:26.850> actually<00:04:27.570> the<00:04:27.690> correct<00:04:27.870> answer

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:28.350 
which is actually the correct answer

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:31.580 
which is actually the correct answer
here<00:04:28.760> well<00:04:29.760> what<00:04:30.060> about<00:04:30.180> these<00:04:30.480> 2<00:04:31.169> plus<00:04:31.560> a

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:31.590 
here well what about these 2 plus a

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:33.980 
here well what about these 2 plus a
negative<00:04:31.830> 2<00:04:32.070> again<00:04:32.510> you're<00:04:33.510> adding<00:04:33.900> a

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:33.990 
negative 2 again you're adding a

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:38.720 
negative 2 again you're adding a
negative<00:04:34.169> 2<00:04:34.620> to<00:04:34.800> 2<00:04:34.910> it's<00:04:35.910> just<00:04:36.240> 0<00:04:37.010> now<00:04:38.010> the

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:38.730 
negative 2 to 2 it's just 0 now the

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:41.750 
negative 2 to 2 it's just 0 now the
absolute<00:04:38.880> value<00:04:39.360> of<00:04:39.419> negative<00:04:39.570> 2<00:04:39.990> is<00:04:40.020> 2<00:04:40.760> but

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:41.760 
absolute value of negative 2 is 2 but

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:44.240 
absolute value of negative 2 is 2 but
then<00:04:41.880> you're<00:04:42.030> subtracting<00:04:42.240> that<00:04:42.750> from<00:04:42.810> 2<00:04:43.800> here

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:44.250 
then you're subtracting that from 2 here

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:48.200 
then you're subtracting that from 2 here
so<00:04:44.400> you're<00:04:44.910> getting<00:04:45.180> to<00:04:45.210> 0<00:04:46.520> the<00:04:47.520> answer<00:04:47.910> here

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:48.210 
so you're getting to 0 the answer here

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:50.119 
so you're getting to 0 the answer here
is<00:04:48.240> B<00:04:48.390> in<00:04:49.260> this<00:04:49.470> case<00:04:49.530> right

00:04:50.119 --> 00:04:50.129 
is B in this case right

00:04:50.129 --> 00:04:52.729 
is B in this case right
here<00:04:50.369> B<00:04:50.729> is<00:04:50.759> gonna<00:04:51.149> get<00:04:51.449> you<00:04:51.719> to<00:04:52.169> the<00:04:52.289> value<00:04:52.649> of

00:04:52.729 --> 00:04:52.739 
here B is gonna get you to the value of

00:04:52.739 --> 00:04:55.999 
here B is gonna get you to the value of
D<00:04:52.979> alright<00:04:53.819> try<00:04:54.779> this<00:04:54.839> let<00:04:55.589> me<00:04:55.619> know<00:04:55.800> what<00:04:55.919> you
