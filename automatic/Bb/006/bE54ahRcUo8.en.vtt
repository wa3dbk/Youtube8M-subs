00:00:58.920 --> 00:00:58.930 
think that the big thing for Manchester

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:00.510 
think that the big thing for Manchester
City<00:00:58.960> is<00:00:59.320> that<00:00:59.560> we<00:00:59.829> know<00:01:00.010> that<00:01:00.280> they're<00:01:00.430> not

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:00.520 
City is that we know that they're not

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:02.729 
City is that we know that they're not
going<00:01:00.730> to<00:01:00.820> go<00:01:00.940> away<00:01:01.030> and<00:01:01.329> we<00:01:01.390> know<00:01:01.630> that<00:01:02.020> sooner

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:03.910 
or later they are going to win it the

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:07.590 
or later they are going to win it the
question<00:01:04.119> is<00:01:04.449> is<00:01:05.189> how<00:01:06.189> much<00:01:06.490> of<00:01:06.820> a<00:01:07.240> team<00:01:07.479> of
