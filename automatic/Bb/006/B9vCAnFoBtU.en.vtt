00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:06.120
 Did you ever wonder why? 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:08.760
 mysteriously in pokémon the series of 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:10.710
 anime and in the game 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:13.440
 the municipality at the time the algés were 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:16.320
 Forgotten Map 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:21.029
 well I have a theory about this 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:23.490
 my theory the following as in the game 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:25.920
 Homicide Pokémon was out of nowhere. 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:28.170
 because the shopkeeper is also mine. 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.990
 theory would be that a sign could be the 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:33.960
 fourth legendary bird of the pokémon 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.790
 but whatever comes to me that the ball 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.129
 It's because Borges 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.110
 this Wednesday besides that would be inside the 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:42.660
 because good genes that on one hand were 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:45.239
 forgotten in anime 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:55.800
 Now I wonder if teaching is 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:58.039
 because moses were on the side erased and 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.809
 also many people say that it seemed 

00:00:58.039 --> 00:01:03.530
 streb that was for him if the yoshi that I 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.530
 I found a pokémon 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:12.869
 This has nothing on you talking about 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:15.750
 which pokémon insert or if it would only be 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:18.570
 a game goal but not it was deleted 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:20.640
 but his script continuing to Pokemon on 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.580
 game 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:26.000
 if in theory you are right 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:28.770
 What I think is not all good 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.530
 I thought it would not be worth remembering that 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:35.100
 would be within the reason s 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:40.829
 who was deleted in the anime pokémon 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:44.159
 now all this because I'm thinking 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:46.770
 We 're not here anymore. 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:51.299
 Experient 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:54.299
 some videos so the pokémon 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:56.549
 everyone says that a sign n it 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:58.110
 It's great, but I do not believe it. 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:02.909
 I still think the letter writer 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:05.820
 would be to cut the truth because it would 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:07.439
 fourth legendary do not know why but 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.270
 my theory says he's the fourth to 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:12.000
 legendary and it would be inside the mouth 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:13.200
 Ball twins in my mind all this has 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.860
 a relationship now 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:18.480
 if you think the same as me I just 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:21.930
 wanted to record this simple quick video 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:23.700
 and just to say it is same if 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:25.290
 does anybody want some theory of the municipality? 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:30.420
 that leaves in the description of the video logo 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:33.750
 below and now what I am curious about 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:34.980
 This I know has some relation between 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:38.930
 they 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:38.930
 you arrive spoke
