when<00:00:53.300> it<00:00:53.450> comes<00:00:53.690> to<00:00:53.930> filling<00:00:54.290> up<00:00:54.410> pores<00:00:54.770> I<00:00:55.130> feel

00:00:55.479 --> 00:00:55.489 
when it comes to filling up pores I feel

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:57.040 
when it comes to filling up pores I feel
like<00:00:55.700> the<00:00:55.820> benefit<00:00:56.210> Porefessional<00:00:56.360> and<00:00:56.960> the

like the benefit Porefessional and the
miracle<00:00:57.500> blur<00:00:57.710> do<00:00:58.430> a<00:00:58.460> better<00:00:58.760> job<00:00:58.850> at<00:00:59.329> it<00:00:59.480> this

00:00:59.740 --> 00:00:59.750 
miracle blur do a better job at it this

miracle blur do a better job at it this
does<00:01:00.200> blur<00:01:00.739> pores<00:01:01.730> but<00:01:02.150> I<00:01:02.360> think<00:01:02.660> this<00:01:02.960> is

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:03.230 
does blur pores but I think this is

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:06.550 
does blur pores but I think this is
better<00:01:03.530> at<00:01:03.829> mattifying<00:01:04.699> and<00:01:05.440> giving<00:01:06.440> you<00:01:06.530> a

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:06.560 
better at mattifying and giving you a

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:09.070 
better at mattifying and giving you a
smooth<00:01:07.100> base<00:01:07.550> for<00:01:07.970> your<00:01:08.060> foundation<00:01:08.300> and

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:09.080 
smooth base for your foundation and

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:10.960 
smooth base for your foundation and
helps<00:01:09.500> prolong<00:01:09.860> the<00:01:10.250> wear<00:01:10.430> of<00:01:10.460> your

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:10.970 
helps prolong the wear of your

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:13.180 
helps prolong the wear of your
foundation<00:01:11.150> but<00:01:12.110> if<00:01:12.200> you<00:01:12.410> are<00:01:12.530> specifically

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:13.190
