00:00:11.559 --> 00:00:16.490
 Welcome to a new video of 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:19.430
 carbon data today I'll show you 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:24.859
 my top 6 resp 

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:27.140
 top 7 apps this month or the me 

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:30.170
 or rediscovered and I in 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:33.320
 play or do more often last time 

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:36.469
 or something else and that's where we start 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:39.250
 Let's start with the most important tweet 

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:45.379
 bot I have now relocated 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:48.129
 before that I used and the whole thing is 

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:50.750
 I think of the design her first school 

00:00:48.129 --> 00:00:52.180
 and all the gestures you make 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:56.840
 can 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:59.359
 and yes that was the first one to see here 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:00.949
 how many seven new tweets can do that 

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:02.899
 we look at it like that 

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:04.820
 We can tap here to see you 

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:11.000
 listen now mister cool has posted something 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:14.780
 and felix balinger and yes that was it 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.010
 before my first app and tui bot 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:18.530
 should actually most of you 

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:20.630
 We do not know how it is already him 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:22.070
 have seen it is a dead client that 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:25.010
 means you can with your twitter 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:32.270
 register account and europe is coming 

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:35.540
 manage and yes the two teplice here 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:37.520
 she is already she costs 89 cents at tui 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:43.340
 bot ska forgot to say that 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:44.390
 tweet board costs two euro 99 and me 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:46.700
 do not really find the price 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:51.140
 reasonable if they cost 9 80 cents 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:53.690
 would you think i would use more users 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:55.880
 have and we get only once to rock 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:58.910
 Let's start with the first level 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:05.390
 and while it is in the app or play 

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:08.000
 to cut things and we 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:10.039
 We always have a goal up here 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.470
 a goal and so many we have to 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:13.780
 have cut off and now in this 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:16.670
 level is the right one 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:21.790
 and now the balls come into play 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:24.740
 the balls or in this case only once 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:26.780
 there must always stop the balls must 

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:28.130
 always be together on one side and 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:32.570
 if it lets through the ball touch 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:33.830
 then it breaks with our line and 

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:35.240
 it's the level to start that new 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:37.460
 Show me a short time I regret now 

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:38.810
 So you have broken the buttocks and 

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:42.640
 now we have to do that with the level new 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:45.980
 start and that's about all 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:47.090
 that will be here now if i am now 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:48.650
 we can do that in the middle 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:50.600
 of course not because both balls 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:54.170
 not on one side and then 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:55.870
 we have to wait now until she's up 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:57.050
 one side are our me all 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:01.570
 cut through 

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:04.540
 the whole is the strategy game and yes 

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:06.710
 the next one is 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:09.920
 I look I pronounce it right 

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:12.140
 and that knows that all determined in 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:14.630
 this one in recent times uses itself 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:17.450
 but often more and more 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:20.120
 People fascinate about it when we 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:22.730
 play click us we are supposed to 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:25.520
 a real or fictional person or 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:26.330
 figurine and he tries to do it 

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:27.820
 expect 

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:29.840
 I think you all know how to do it 

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:30.140
 works if not is not synonymous 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:32.450
 bad 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:34.430
 and now just come up with a few questions 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:38.290
 and I answer them and look 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:38.290
 let's see if he finds out 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:50.240
 that was it from the questions and 

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:52.340
 that's right i have at the moment 

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:55.640
 benjamin resp 

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:58.730
 thought touchpen and that works 

00:03:55.640 --> 00:04:02.000
 and almost every thing from when you 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:06.320
 now in the unknown one takes yes 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:10.520
 the next highstreet rica pro the app 

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:12.640
 has once free and short you now 

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:15.560
 again what i know i know how much 

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:16.910
 But I believe 89 cents and if we have them 

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:20.049
 open here we can already see 

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:22.350
 example picture that I did with it 

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:24.540
 and 

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:26.670
 here are just cool effects if 

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:30.060
 I now click on it, for example 

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:33.360
 then we can save that here or 

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:36.060
 share and we'll just delete it 

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:38.670
 and unfortunately can make a new picture 

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:40.260
 we see that so unfortunately 

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:42.270
 now we can not do anything because in 

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:44.250
 my pain is dark and we have nothing 

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:45.600
 but see about that, especially in a 

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:48.540
 example picture we can see here 

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:50.490
 to insert between blanc effect that is 

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:53.190
 if I at least in the photo only one 

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:54.660
 divide the area wanted to have sharp 

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:57.470
 and the rest should be out of focus 

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:59.850
 and there are pretty cool things 

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:01.460
 Here we are now me in the dark 

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:06.150
 sit 

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:08.670
 so is the next off and that is called 

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:12.710
 looks russ kate the app has been around 

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:12.710
 longer outside 

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:17.430
 I'll just show you how 

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:18.540
 you might have noticed we are 

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:20.820
 today on my iphone 

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:23.100
 I have already missed that 

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:25.310
 I was every last one 

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:27.420
 videos i was always on on an ipad 

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:29.340
 That's why I have my iphone today 

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:31.470
 and i hope i do not mind that 

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:34.830
 that the quality is not too good 

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:37.190
 like the ipad and what they do here 

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:42.060
 You have to control a skateboard here 

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:43.350
 and there are a lot of gestures and 

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:46.290
 I hold it tight now otherwise 

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:47.160
 I slip the thing away and me 

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:50.070
 just show a bit 

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:55.790
 Gameplay writes the comments ob 

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:55.790
 you want to see a preview 

00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:05.640
 and I'll just show you the ones 

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:07.860
 base gestures so so does that 

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:10.400
 skateboard with back when we are in the 

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:12.690
 go backwards then it goes back 

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:15.930
 and just forward 

00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:18.000
 if we want to make an ollie for the 

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:21.030
 you know that an ollie is that it 

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:23.160
 a jump on the skateboard and then 

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:25.770
 we have to move here and only 

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:29.940
 So pulling is not very important though 

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:33.620
 if we now why then we see 

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:33.620
 already an ollie is displayed 

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:38.020
 and here we can, of course, too 

00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:39.820
 to suffer the rails 

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:42.040
 So there are many possibilities there 

00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:42.820
 are there many tricks you are 

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:45.880
 try out 

00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:48.880
 the app is really cool so the last one 

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:52.180
 the last game in my category is 

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:54.100
 in the c4 that no weaknesses in the 

00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:56.020
 unfortunately not show that not in the moment 

00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:58.570
 picture would fit and but you 

00:06:56.020 --> 00:07:00.850
 should recognize if not linked I 

00:06:58.570 --> 00:07:02.710
 you so if now click on mtv 

00:07:00.850 --> 00:07:06.280
 then I invite you on one 

00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:08.080
 preview of the global I like it 

00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:08.919
 really well done and therefore completely 

00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:10.690
 me that 

00:07:08.919 --> 00:07:12.790
 if you want an apple from me 

00:07:10.690 --> 00:07:14.290
 want to add it to the comments 

00:07:12.790 --> 00:07:16.390
 I did not think it was that important 

00:07:14.290 --> 00:07:19.390
 there were already many and here we come 

00:07:16.390 --> 00:07:22.330
 to the last app I last for now 

00:07:19.390 --> 00:07:25.770
 very useful this is my webclips 

00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:28.150
 Although it looks like there is still one 

00:07:25.770 --> 00:07:29.830
 but you can not see that in gray 

00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:32.860
 the camera so you can see the dark 

00:07:29.830 --> 00:07:34.960
 the dark or is still one 

00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:37.479
 There you see yourself so well and if you are 

00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:40.210
 that opens, here comes my web 

00:07:37.479 --> 00:07:42.130
 clip that is on a channel at the moment 

00:07:40.210 --> 00:07:44.650
 I have here then we see a few 

00:07:42.130 --> 00:07:46.419
 Data has uploaded 20 apps 

00:07:44.650 --> 00:07:49.150
 last video was correct apps 

00:07:46.419 --> 00:07:50.860
 install without jailbreak at 16 da 

00:07:49.150 --> 00:07:51.850
 you should also stop by and 

00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:53.890
 here 

00:07:51.850 --> 00:07:57.100
 I think it's better than that 

00:07:53.890 --> 00:07:59.380
 youtube app and yes that's it 

00:07:57.100 --> 00:08:03.419
 from my video and until the next one 

00:07:59.380 --> 00:08:03.419
 video people
