00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:51.640 
child to really increase in the ranks of
gymnastics<00:02:49.940> because<00:02:50.330> it's<00:02:50.750> not<00:02:50.959> just<00:02:51.019> as<00:02:51.410> you

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:51.650 
gymnastics because it's not just as you

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:53.710 
gymnastics because it's not just as you
said<00:02:51.860> your<00:02:52.010> kids<00:02:52.220> of<00:02:52.310> gymnastics<00:02:52.849> it<00:02:53.269> was<00:02:53.510> the

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:53.720 
said your kids of gymnastics it was the

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:55.720 
said your kids of gymnastics it was the
whole<00:02:53.959> which<00:02:54.380> your<00:02:54.590> family<00:02:55.010> has<00:02:55.190> to<00:02:55.370> support

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:55.730 
whole which your family has to support

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:58.059 
whole which your family has to support
them<00:02:55.970> under<00:02:56.360> percent<00:02:56.660> and<00:02:57.140> I<00:02:57.709> think<00:02:57.950> it's

00:02:58.059 --> 00:02:58.069 
them under percent and I think it's

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:00.130 
them under percent and I think it's
really<00:02:58.250> important<00:02:58.880> that<00:02:59.120> the<00:02:59.630> kids<00:02:59.870> know<00:03:00.110> that

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:00.140 
really important that the kids know that

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:01.870 
really important that the kids know that
they<00:03:00.470> have<00:03:00.739> not<00:03:00.980> just<00:03:01.190> the<00:03:01.280> backing<00:03:01.640> of<00:03:01.730> their

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:01.880 
they have not just the backing of their

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:03.160 
they have not just the backing of their
friends<00:03:02.090> in<00:03:02.269> the<00:03:02.360> gym<00:03:02.569> but<00:03:02.690> also<00:03:02.840> their

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:03.170 
friends in the gym but also their

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:05.920 
friends in the gym but also their
outstanding<00:03:03.739> high<00:03:04.099> network<00:03:04.430> they're<00:03:05.299> a<00:03:05.599> very

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:05.930 
outstanding high network they're a very

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:09.460 
outstanding high network they're a very
integral<00:03:06.470> part<00:03:07.010> of<00:03:07.280> of<00:03:08.079> each<00:03:09.079> one<00:03:09.290> of<00:03:09.319> our

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:09.470 
integral part of of each one of our

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:11.800 
integral part of of each one of our
characters<00:03:09.890> lives<00:03:10.160> and<00:03:10.940> of<00:03:11.090> course<00:03:11.299> each<00:03:11.540> one

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:11.810 
characters lives and of course each one

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:14.289 
characters lives and of course each one
represents<00:03:12.560> a<00:03:12.680> different<00:03:13.130> element<00:03:13.640> in<00:03:14.000> a

00:03:14.289 --> 00:03:14.299 
represents a different element in a

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:16.300 
represents a different element in a
different<00:03:14.690> facet<00:03:14.870> of<00:03:15.140> parenting<00:03:15.650> I<00:03:15.950> think

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:16.310 
different facet of parenting I think

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:19.180 
different facet of parenting I think
that<00:03:16.579> the<00:03:16.819> the<00:03:17.600> ambition<00:03:18.319> and<00:03:18.500> the<00:03:18.920> dedication

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:19.190 
that the the ambition and the dedication

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:22.569 
that the the ambition and the dedication
and<00:03:19.940> the<00:03:20.030> sense<00:03:20.870> of<00:03:21.049> self<00:03:21.380> discipline<00:03:22.100> right

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:22.579 
and the sense of self discipline right

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:24.610 
and the sense of self discipline right
which<00:03:23.120> you<00:03:23.450> have<00:03:23.780> to<00:03:23.810> happen<00:03:24.170> to<00:03:24.410> jim<00:03:24.590> mash

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:24.620 
which you have to happen to jim mash

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:26.680 
which you have to happen to jim mash
because<00:03:25.040> if<00:03:25.190> you<00:03:25.280> don't<00:03:25.489> you're<00:03:26.359> going<00:03:26.510> to<00:03:26.600> get

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:38.440 
going to school I think it just

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:41.229 
going to school I think it just

coordination but mentally as well as you

00:03:51.799 --> 00:03:53.920 
coordination but mentally as well as you
can<00:03:52.010> you<00:03:52.549> have<00:03:52.639> to<00:03:52.760> kind<00:03:52.880> of<00:03:52.970> multi<00:03:53.359> task<00:03:53.690> that

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:53.930 
can you have to kind of multi task that

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:55.390 
can you have to kind of multi task that
your<00:03:54.049> gym<00:03:54.260> is<00:03:54.380> gonna<00:03:54.590> be<00:03:54.799> like<00:03:54.980> a<00:03:55.040> pain

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:55.400 
your gym is gonna be like a pain

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.220 
your gym is gonna be like a pain
sometimes<00:03:55.700> you<00:03:56.090> make<00:03:56.480> a<00:03:56.540> split-second

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:57.230 
sometimes you make a split-second

00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:58.930 
sometimes you make a split-second
decision<00:03:57.739> and<00:03:57.950> as<00:03:58.069> to<00:03:58.310> where<00:03:58.489> they're<00:03:58.609> going

00:03:58.930 --> 00:03:58.940 
decision and as to where they're going

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:01.360 
decision and as to where they're going
to<00:03:59.030> get<00:03:59.150> to<00:03:59.359> flip<00:03:59.630> or<00:03:59.810> do<00:03:59.900> I<00:03:59.930> stop<00:04:00.319> and<00:04:00.620> I<00:04:00.680> think

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:01.370 
to get to flip or do I stop and I think

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:04.059 
to get to flip or do I stop and I think
that<00:04:01.700> all<00:04:02.000> factors<00:04:02.660> into<00:04:02.769> the<00:04:03.769> mental

00:04:04.059 --> 00:04:04.069 
that all factors into the mental

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:08.410 
that all factors into the mental
operating<00:04:04.519> of<00:04:05.920> certain<00:04:06.920> I<00:04:07.040> girls<00:04:07.730> I<00:04:07.970> need<00:04:08.299> to

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:08.420 
operating of certain I girls I need to

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:10.420 
operating of certain I girls I need to
do<00:04:08.540> everything<00:04:08.690> perfect<00:04:09.380> right<00:04:09.680> they<00:04:09.950> they

that's enough they won't stop until

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:22.390 
that's enough they won't stop until
they've<00:04:21.289> got<00:04:21.470> it<00:04:21.650> there's<00:04:21.859> something<00:04:22.190> inside

it's fun to watch it a super inspiring

00:04:26.659 --> 00:04:30.190 
it's fun to watch it a super inspiring
process<00:04:27.289> I<00:04:27.440> think<00:04:27.800> the<00:04:27.919> way<00:04:28.070> that<00:04:28.099> they<00:04:29.200> mold

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:30.200 
process I think the way that they mold

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:32.080 
process I think the way that they mold
together<00:04:30.440> the<00:04:30.950> two<00:04:31.130> pieces<00:04:31.490> of<00:04:31.520> not<00:04:31.880> just

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:32.090 
together the two pieces of not just

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:34.300 
together the two pieces of not just
being<00:04:32.419> the<00:04:32.720> after<00:04:33.140> action<00:04:33.289> and<00:04:33.710> stunts<00:04:34.010> but

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:34.310 
being the after action and stunts but

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:36.250 
being the after action and stunts but
with<00:04:34.580> the<00:04:34.820> storyline<00:04:35.390> together<00:04:35.780> it<00:04:36.050> just

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:36.260 
with the storyline together it just

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:38.260 
with the storyline together it just
makes<00:04:36.440> a<00:04:36.740> really<00:04:37.099> compelling<00:04:37.460> TV<00:04:37.700> show<00:04:38.000> the

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:38.270 
makes a really compelling TV show the

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:39.670 
makes a really compelling TV show the
kind<00:04:38.479> of<00:04:38.570> covers<00:04:38.870> it<00:04:39.229> covers<00:04:39.500> all<00:04:39.620> the

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:39.680 
kind of covers it covers all the

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:40.810 
kind of covers it covers all the
different<00:04:40.039> basis<00:04:40.280> I<00:04:40.370> think<00:04:40.520> people<00:04:40.640> would<00:04:40.760> be

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:40.820 
different basis I think people would be

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:43.270 
different basis I think people would be
crazy<00:04:41.180> not<00:04:41.510> to<00:04:41.659> watch<00:04:41.960> the<00:04:42.229> show<00:04:42.280> exactly

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:43.280
