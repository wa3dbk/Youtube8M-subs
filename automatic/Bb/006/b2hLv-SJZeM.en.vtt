getting the most out of oak scale I

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:59.480 
getting the most out of oak scale I
really<00:00:57.990> wanted<00:00:58.260> to<00:00:58.350> have<00:00:58.500> a<00:00:58.530> long<00:00:58.830> main<00:00:59.190> line

00:00:59.480 --> 00:00:59.490

and<00:00:59.820> I<00:00:59.940> wanted<00:01:00.240> to<00:01:00.300> have<00:01:00.390> a<00:01:00.420> lot<00:01:00.660> of<00:01:00.690> distance

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:01.080 
and I wanted to have a lot of distance

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:04.760 
and I wanted to have a lot of distance
between<00:01:01.500> towns<00:01:02.370> so<00:01:03.360> that<00:01:03.540> meant<00:01:03.840> at<00:01:04.650> least

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:04.770 
between towns so that meant at least

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:07.070 
between towns so that meant at least
twice<00:01:05.250> around<00:01:05.640> and<00:01:06.030> wonder<00:01:06.690> if<00:01:06.750> there's<00:01:06.960> a<00:01:07.020> way

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
twice around and wonder if there's a way

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.290 
twice around and wonder if there's a way
I<00:01:07.200> can<00:01:07.380> squeeze<00:01:07.860> in<00:01:08.130> three<00:01:08.550> so<00:01:08.880> that's<00:01:09.030> what<00:01:09.270> I

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:09.300 
I can squeeze in three so that's what I

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:14.810 
I can squeeze in three so that's what I
did<00:01:12.560> what<00:01:13.560> does<00:01:13.740> it<00:01:13.890> take<00:01:14.100> to<00:01:14.340> build<00:01:14.640> a
