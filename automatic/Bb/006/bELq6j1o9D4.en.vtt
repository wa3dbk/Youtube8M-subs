on the two ships I thought they were
going<00:01:42.930> to<00:01:43.020> have<00:01:43.170> like<00:01:43.350> this<00:01:43.500> epic<00:01:43.979> t3<00:01:44.490> slugfest

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
going to have like this epic t3 slugfest

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
and then the low-key pilot just run away

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:49.280 
and then the low-key pilot just run away
yeah<00:01:47.460> I<00:01:47.490> mean<00:01:47.790> it's<00:01:47.850> at<00:01:48.570> some<00:01:48.840> point<00:01:49.110> it<00:01:49.259> just

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
yeah I mean it's at some point it just

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.230 
yeah I mean it's at some point it just
becomes<00:01:49.650> math<00:01:49.979> doesn't<00:01:50.340> it<00:01:50.490> I<00:01:50.580> mean<00:01:50.729> at<00:01:51.090> some

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
becomes math doesn't it I mean at some

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:52.999 
becomes math doesn't it I mean at some
point<00:01:51.299> you<00:01:51.509> just<00:01:51.540> have<00:01:51.750> to<00:01:51.960> say<00:01:52.110> if<00:01:52.619> I<00:01:52.770> just

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
point you just have to say if I just

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:56.539 
point you just have to say if I just
orbit<00:01:53.780> aggressively<00:01:54.780> then<00:01:55.200> I'll<00:01:55.380> win<00:01:55.590> which

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
orbit aggressively then I'll win which

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.789 
orbit aggressively then I'll win which
is<00:01:56.700> boring<00:01:57.000> but<00:01:57.299> the<00:01:57.479> smart<00:01:57.659> thing<00:01:57.869> to<00:01:57.960> do<00:01:58.079> yeah

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
is boring but the smart thing to do yeah

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.560 
is boring but the smart thing to do yeah
I<00:01:59.070> mean<00:01:59.610> I<00:01:59.729> guess<00:01:59.759> it's<00:02:00.030> like<00:02:00.090> taking<00:02:00.329> a<00:02:00.479> knee

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
I mean I guess it's like taking a knee

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.130 
I mean I guess it's like taking a knee
in<00:02:00.689> football<00:02:01.049> or<00:02:01.290> passing<00:02:01.979> backwards<00:02:02.340> and

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:03.140 
in football or passing backwards and

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:06.649 
in football or passing backwards and
European<00:02:04.140> football<00:02:04.470> or<00:02:05.360> having<00:02:06.360> the<00:02:06.450> gold

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
European football or having the gold

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:08.330 
European football or having the gold
taken<00:02:07.049> away<00:02:07.200> from<00:02:07.259> you<00:02:07.470> for<00:02:07.500> no<00:02:07.770> reason<00:02:07.799> by<00:02:08.310> a
