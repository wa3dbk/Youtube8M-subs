00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.889
 we will start with the law both cases 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:15.770
 the Espelette pepper pool with that 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:19.680
 therefore recruits for that you need tomatoes 

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:20.670
 onions for 4 people 1 onion 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.430
 enough 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:27.029
 symptom was a little chopped garlic and 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:36.090
 between 800 and 1 kg of gold on the squid 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:38.879
 thin we will amend the tomatoes heaped 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:41.730
 it's removing the skin so it's diving 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:44.100
 in boiling hot water 30 seconds 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.210
 but m 2 after the outings to dive them 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.600
 in cold water to stop the 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:53.070
 cooking is there to easily preserve 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:54.960
 so do not hide the fact that 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:01:00.180
 plunges into boiling water for 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:02.190
 two seconds later we 'll 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.730
 plunged into the cold of power was the 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.730
 baking 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:25.750
 that's the tomato will miss the 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:29.259
 coface regarding a future epr is the 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:32.530
 If the clean from the following size 

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:34.659
 of Canada in two points 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:38.890
 the commission has its little ones and at the 

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:41.130
 baking it retracts so good that 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:45.280
 seems easily cons in frozen 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.729
 and then it's not good 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:48.000
 products 

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:51.569
 even when frozen and it serves well 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.569
 it's so easy 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:02:02.799
 we are still going to drain them well and 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:04.899
 that she goes next for done well 

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:16.329
 heat the oil so that March 15 has 

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:17.739
 seized that it is necessary to avoid that it does not move 

00:02:16.329 --> 00:02:19.090
 too much to stir them up from the start because 

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:20.620
 it just chills right away 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:23.109
 the pan and therefore its capacity 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:26.290
 to open the chords to spell trace of 

00:02:23.109 --> 00:02:28.810
 your fingers and twice 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:30.130
 we will stop we will use the territory 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:32.050
 for 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:35.380
 the ranks to then make them go 

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:41.230
 to heat them to grasp gt2 confesses 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:43.360
 right now so behind I do 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:46.200
 warm my faith I put back to the taste of 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:46.200
 bonus anyway 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:57.410
 m a crowd of fez then we put there the 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:03:00.130
 onions to make them sweat too with 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:00.130
 a little bit 

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:06.420
 some chopped garlic these two there that was 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:09.380
 peeled and mixed with a little oil 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:11.880
 of olive is to ensure the conservation 

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:14.010
 and when the name started to be 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:21.120
 then his first name 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:23.710
 and here we can add the tomato and 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:27.750
 that's how it is 

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:30.520
 the fire it will pose must do I add 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:31.810
 scones documents is so if 

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:34.390
 is not very strong like a feather in 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:36.130
 wavelets this pure gently during a 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:50.050
 quarter of an hour twenty minutes stirring 

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:52.210
 change in itself that so we query 

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:54.010
 new handle of queries for 

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:56.050
 four portions good mix takes 2 

00:03:54.010 --> 00:04:00.580
 seconds it takes a little cooking 

00:03:56.050 --> 00:04:02.290
 but who stop slightly again 

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:04.600
 add a little taste web apps the 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:06.850
 request this little nutty taste very 

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:12.640
 interesting and in addition it adds to the 

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:21.880
 color will be joined for the death 

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:23.080
 I use a circle and we can end up 

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:26.970
 a 

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:29.120
 duffy is isolated to make it 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:29.120
 m 

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:33.400
 pop 

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:39.610
 Oh
