00:00:01.090 --> 00:00:07.360
 welcome to the academy internet theme 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:10.350
 multiplus tell me how many numbers between 

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:13.020
 1 and 100 are multiple of 6 but not of 9 

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:14.500
 that we recommend to do this a 

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:20.220
 small day 

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:20.220
 Mirage diagram intercepted here 

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:23.170
 where 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:29.030
 there must always be your universe 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:31.250
 those of blue will come to be multiples 

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:34.190
 of 6 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:36.080
 the red ones the multiples of 9 and this 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:39.400
 which is the intersection that would come to be 

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:39.400
 what do you think 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:47.390
 the multiples of 6 and 9 ok we're going to 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:49.060
 put here let's shadow is painted 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:54.150
 green 

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:54.150
 that is, a multiple of 6 and 9 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.300
 therefore they are not only 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.640
 this zone 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.950
 multiple of 6 that are not 9 or the 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.700
 blue but nothing of the red but for it 

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:05.890
 I have to find out this 

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:08.470
 find the multiples of 6 and in easy 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:12.060
 multiple of 6 can I express like this too 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:14.630
 this way it's better 66 for something 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:17.030
 between 1 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:22.360
 yes 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:25.630
 / 6/6/6 then I stay here 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:26.980
 1 in 360 as something look that I do not 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:29.380
 I solve and I leave it in tenths 

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:34.000
 we need to explain why they have 36 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:36.550
 is 16 as something ok what does this mean 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:40.570
 that here is greater than 0 as something its 

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:43.180
 bridge that is 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 this 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:48.900
 means that here is going to be a 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:52.870
 course 23 until that number up to 16 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:55.630
 because that was 16.1 16.2 is less than 

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:57.759
 is the integer that comes closest by 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:59.710
 course he says is the limit up there 

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:03.100
 the multiples of 6 but they tell you that 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:05.020
 these serves the ones that are here 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:08.560
 to find out 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:10.840
 Now what does 69 mean? 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:13.650
 it's the same as you say the least common 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:13.650
 multiple of them 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:21.030
 minimum common multiple of 6 and 9 is 18 ok 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:23.410
 then you will have to take out a type of 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:28.130
 1818 here 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:30.820
 I do the same procedure 18 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:33.770
 between 1 and 

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:36.980
 but as something 

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:41.390
 I do not have to shut up and here I think 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:43.370
 5 comes out because already with 6 608 5 something so 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:47.120
 you say that it takes values 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:49.610
 from 1 to 5 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:52.790
 They are the 55 writes 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:55.140
 Now I complete my information 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:59.760
 how good 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:03:01.350
 I'm 16 but the intersection remembers 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:02.910
 that with your complete by diagram should 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:05.970
 the most important thing would always be the 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:11.720
 intersection here I have 5 as everything was 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:14.360
 16 is a and that being 11 11 5 gives me 16 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:16.360
 solution was not necessary to find the 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:18.490
 multiples of 9 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:21.100
 but if they asked me of course 

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:26.250
 had to resort to that month and how many 

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:26.250
 are multiples of 6 and 19 but not d 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:32.750
 6 and 9 then it would be this with this and you 

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:36.019
 removed what has come here in my 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:39.040
 imperfection good guys let's hope 

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:39.040
 have clarified some doubts 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:45.630
 disseminate the information we return with 

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:45.630
