air<00:00:20.250> dropper<00:00:20.550> century<00:00:20.910> but<00:00:21.449> you<00:00:21.570> run<00:00:21.780> faster<00:00:22.320> I

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
air dropper century but you run faster I

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.140 
air dropper century but you run faster I
think<00:00:22.710> it's<00:00:22.830> fifteen<00:00:23.190> percent<00:00:23.550> faster<00:00:23.760> but<00:00:24.119> it

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
think it's fifteen percent faster but it

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:25.730 
think it's fifteen percent faster but it
feels<00:00:24.449> blinding<00:00:25.110> and<00:00:25.289> if<00:00:25.350> you<00:00:25.410> combine<00:00:25.560> that

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
feels blinding and if you combine that

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.620 
feels blinding and if you combine that
with<00:00:25.890> commando<00:00:26.400> it's<00:00:26.550> really<00:00:26.760> effective<00:00:27.180> it's

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
with commando it's really effective it's

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.720 
with commando it's really effective it's
frustrating<00:00:28.050> to<00:00:28.199> die<00:00:28.440> from<00:00:28.650> it<00:00:28.859> but<00:00:29.010> I've

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
frustrating to die from it but I've

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:30.740 
frustrating to die from it but I've
always<00:00:29.940> thought<00:00:30.180> it<00:00:30.330> wasn't<00:00:30.480> totally

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
always thought it wasn't totally

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.320 
always thought it wasn't totally
unbalanced<00:00:31.350> because<00:00:31.800> you're<00:00:32.610> unarmed<00:00:32.760> when

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:33.330 
unbalanced because you're unarmed when

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:34.460 
unbalanced because you're unarmed when
you<00:00:33.449> run<00:00:33.600> around<00:00:33.690> with<00:00:33.809> that<00:00:33.960> grenade<00:00:34.110> in<00:00:34.350> your

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:34.470 
you run around with that grenade in your

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:36.620 
you run around with that grenade in your
hand<00:00:34.760> but<00:00:35.760> they're<00:00:35.910> getting<00:00:36.120> rid<00:00:36.210> of<00:00:36.269> it<00:00:36.480> and

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
hand but they're getting rid of it and

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.299 
hand but they're getting rid of it and
now<00:00:37.050> your<00:00:37.320> run<00:00:37.590> speed<00:00:37.829> is<00:00:38.010> going<00:00:38.130> to<00:00:38.190> be

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
now your run speed is going to be

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:39.889 
now your run speed is going to be
determined<00:00:38.790> by<00:00:38.880> your<00:00:38.910> perks<00:00:39.329> and<00:00:39.600> your<00:00:39.690> guns

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
determined by your perks and your guns

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:42.799 
determined by your perks and your guns
and<00:00:40.200> and<00:00:40.380> no<00:00:40.770> longer<00:00:40.980> the<00:00:41.309> care<00:00:41.489> package<00:00:41.850> so<00:00:42.360> so

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
and and no longer the care package so so

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:44.120 
and and no longer the care package so so
that's<00:00:42.960> a<00:00:43.020> good<00:00:43.170> thing<00:00:43.320> i<00:00:43.469> guess<00:00:43.649> i'll<00:00:43.829> have<00:00:44.040> it

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:44.130 
that's a good thing i guess i'll have it

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:46.430 
that's a good thing i guess i'll have it
frustrated<00:00:44.640> most<00:00:44.820> people<00:00:45.120> the<00:00:45.899> sentry<00:00:46.230> guns

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
frustrated most people the sentry guns

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.229 
frustrated most people the sentry guns
it<00:00:46.950> was<00:00:47.070> possible<00:00:47.250> to<00:00:47.489> play<00:00:47.730> sentry<00:00:48.059> guns

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
it was possible to play sentry guns

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.299 
it was possible to play sentry guns
inside<00:00:48.660> of<00:00:48.809> walls<00:00:49.079> at<00:00:49.620> some<00:00:49.950> points<00:00:50.219> i've

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
inside of walls at some points i've

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.160 
inside of walls at some points i've
never<00:00:50.489> done<00:00:50.700> this<00:00:50.910> but<00:00:51.120> i<00:00:51.180> I've<00:00:51.660> heard<00:00:51.899> of<00:00:52.020> it

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
never done this but i I've heard of it

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.220 
never done this but i I've heard of it
so<00:00:53.129> they're<00:00:53.250> improving<00:00:53.489> the<00:00:53.760> the<00:00:54.090> sentry<00:00:55.079> gun

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
so they're improving the the sentry gun

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:56.869 
so they're improving the the sentry gun
placement<00:00:55.829> detection<00:00:56.219> there<00:00:56.370> and<00:00:56.489> that's<00:00:56.760> an

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
placement detection there and that's an

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:58.580 
placement detection there and that's an
improvement<00:00:57.120> but<00:00:57.780> this<00:00:57.899> third<00:00:58.110> one's<00:00:58.350> a<00:00:58.440> big

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
improvement but this third one's a big

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.760 
improvement but this third one's a big

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
deal to me the model 1887 when they nerf

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.040 
deal to me the model 1887 when they nerf
them<00:01:02.100> they<00:01:02.399> made<00:01:02.610> the<00:01:02.730> game<00:01:02.850> much<00:01:03.180> better<00:01:03.510> and

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:04.050 
them they made the game much better and

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:06.650 
them they made the game much better and
I<00:01:04.140> appreciate<00:01:04.170> them<00:01:04.589> for<00:01:04.739> doing<00:01:04.979> that<00:01:05.250> but<00:01:05.940> if

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:06.660 
I appreciate them for doing that but if

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:08.930 
I appreciate them for doing that but if
you<00:01:06.810> run<00:01:07.050> bling<00:01:07.470> on<00:01:07.740> your<00:01:08.369> secondary<00:01:08.819> weapon

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:08.940 
you run bling on your secondary weapon

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:11.270 
you run bling on your secondary weapon
and<00:01:09.450> you<00:01:09.539> get<00:01:09.720> a<00:01:09.959> Kimbo<00:01:10.380> and<00:01:10.619> full<00:01:11.039> metal

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
and you get a Kimbo and full metal

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:12.559 
and you get a Kimbo and full metal
jacket<00:01:11.610> and<00:01:11.700> you<00:01:11.759> need<00:01:11.880> bling<00:01:12.060> pro<00:01:12.240> for<00:01:12.420> this

00:01:12.559 --> 00:01:12.569 
jacket and you need bling pro for this

00:01:12.569 --> 00:01:14.719 
jacket and you need bling pro for this
then<00:01:13.080> it<00:01:13.229> has<00:01:13.350> the<00:01:13.500> same<00:01:13.740> range<00:01:14.069> as<00:01:14.340> it<00:01:14.580> did

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
then it has the same range as it did

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.430 
then it has the same range as it did
before<00:01:14.819> they<00:01:15.149> nerfed<00:01:15.390> them<00:01:15.600> and<00:01:15.780> they've

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:16.440 
before they nerfed them and they've

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:18.290 
before they nerfed them and they've
repaired<00:01:16.800> that<00:01:16.920> so<00:01:17.459> now<00:01:17.729> it's<00:01:17.759> going<00:01:18.060> to<00:01:18.119> be

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:18.300

patch<00:03:08.380> as<00:03:08.590> quickly<00:03:08.799> as<00:03:09.010> the<00:03:09.130> other<00:03:09.280> platforms

00:03:09.839 --> 00:03:09.849 
patch as quickly as the other platforms

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:12.089 
patch as quickly as the other platforms
did<00:03:10.090> but<00:03:10.810> it<00:03:10.900> probably<00:03:11.080> won't<00:03:11.290> it'll<00:03:11.860> probably

00:03:12.089 --> 00:03:12.099 
did but it probably won't it'll probably

00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:14.729 
did but it probably won't it'll probably
be<00:03:12.250> delayed<00:03:12.549> compared<00:03:13.030> to<00:03:13.180> those<00:03:13.330> and<00:03:13.780> and

00:03:14.729 --> 00:03:14.739 
be delayed compared to those and and

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:17.009 
be delayed compared to those and and
that's<00:03:15.400> what<00:03:15.549> we<00:03:15.670> can<00:03:15.819> expect<00:03:15.970> so<00:03:16.360> PC<00:03:16.660> hasn't

00:03:17.009 --> 00:03:17.019 
that's what we can expect so PC hasn't

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:19.470 
that's what we can expect so PC hasn't
now<00:03:17.140> ps3<00:03:17.799> will<00:03:18.190> probably<00:03:18.670> get<00:03:18.790> it<00:03:18.940> soon<00:03:19.180> and

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:19.480 
now ps3 will probably get it soon and

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:22.440 
now ps3 will probably get it soon and
Xbox<00:03:20.230> will<00:03:20.440> get<00:03:20.560> it<00:03:20.970> after<00:03:21.970> the<00:03:22.090> other<00:03:22.209> two

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:22.450 
Xbox will get it after the other two

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:25.110 
Xbox will get it after the other two
unless<00:03:23.079> they've<00:03:23.350> improved<00:03:24.100> since<00:03:24.730> the<00:03:24.940> last

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:25.120 
unless they've improved since the last

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:27.360 
unless they've improved since the last
couple<00:03:25.359> patches<00:03:25.630> so<00:03:26.470> I<00:03:26.739> hope<00:03:26.950> you<00:03:27.070> guys<00:03:27.190> like
