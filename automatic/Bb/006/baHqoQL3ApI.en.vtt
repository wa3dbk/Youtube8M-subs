00:05:56.539 --> 00:05:58.659 
not going to play it just yet reason
being<00:05:56.569> is<00:05:57.409> that<00:05:57.470> because<00:05:57.770> the<00:05:58.099> length<00:05:58.280> of<00:05:58.490> the

00:05:58.659 --> 00:05:58.669 
being is that because the length of the

00:05:58.669 --> 00:06:00.760 
being is that because the length of the
