to 17 18 minutes and if you're using
a<00:04:16.430> electric<00:04:17.419> stove<00:04:17.750> what<00:04:18.049> I<00:04:18.079> usually<00:04:18.440> do<00:04:18.859> is<00:04:19.190> I

00:04:19.569 --> 00:04:19.579 
a electric stove what I usually do is I

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:21.670 
a electric stove what I usually do is I
would<00:04:19.730> bring<00:04:20.329> it<00:04:20.449> up<00:04:20.570> to<00:04:20.750> a<00:04:20.780> boil<00:04:21.049> and<00:04:21.350> I'd<00:04:21.440> have

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:21.680 
would bring it up to a boil and I'd have

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:24.760 
would bring it up to a boil and I'd have
another<00:04:22.010> element<00:04:22.850> on<00:04:23.060> that<00:04:23.930> was<00:04:24.110> on<00:04:24.380> a<00:04:24.410> very

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:24.770 
another element on that was on a very

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:28.719 
another element on that was on a very
low<00:04:25.130> heat<00:04:25.990> so<00:04:26.990> as<00:04:27.320> soon<00:04:27.530> as<00:04:27.650> it<00:04:27.800> brought<00:04:28.340> up<00:04:28.580> to

00:04:28.719 --> 00:04:28.729 
low heat so as soon as it brought up to

00:04:28.729 --> 00:04:30.490 
low heat so as soon as it brought up to
a<00:04:28.820> boil<00:04:29.060> I<00:04:29.240> put<00:04:29.479> the<00:04:29.600> lid<00:04:29.780> on<00:04:29.960> it<00:04:30.110> and<00:04:30.199> then

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:30.500 
a boil I put the lid on it and then

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:34.330 
a boil I put the lid on it and then
transfer<00:04:31.250> it<00:04:31.520> to<00:04:31.550> the<00:04:32.090> other<00:04:32.570> element<00:04:33.470> that<00:04:33.650> is

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:34.340 
transfer it to the other element that is

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:36.790 
transfer it to the other element that is
on<00:04:34.580> a<00:04:34.610> low<00:04:34.850> heat<00:04:35.180> so<00:04:35.510> that<00:04:35.750> way<00:04:35.930> you<00:04:35.990> don't<00:04:36.470> have

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:36.800 
on a low heat so that way you don't have

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:40.780 
on a low heat so that way you don't have
any<00:04:37.240> time<00:04:38.240> for<00:04:38.660> the<00:04:39.590> heat<00:04:39.830> to<00:04:40.040> go<00:04:40.220> down<00:04:40.460> in<00:04:40.669> the

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:40.790 
any time for the heat to go down in the

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:43.120 
any time for the heat to go down in the
element<00:04:41.180> now<00:04:42.020> this<00:04:42.260> has<00:04:42.410> just<00:04:42.620> come<00:04:42.830> to<00:04:43.040> the

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:43.130 
element now this has just come to the

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:45.820 
element now this has just come to the
