00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
building in here probably some cranes

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:29.240 
building in here probably some cranes
and<00:00:24.800> some<00:00:26.210> loading<00:00:27.619> lorries<00:00:28.619> probably<00:00:29.010> to

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
and some loading lorries probably to

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.790 
and some loading lorries probably to
load<00:00:29.490> stuff<00:00:29.789> to<00:00:30.000> their<00:00:30.150> submarines<00:00:30.660> and<00:00:31.050> so

load stuff to their submarines and so

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.080 
load stuff to their submarines and so
I'll<00:00:31.980> see<00:00:32.160> how<00:00:32.250> it<00:00:32.279> goes<00:00:32.399> probably<00:00:32.850> some

many it's like one that one goes in
submarine<00:01:15.270> oh<00:01:15.420> yeah<00:01:15.630> none<00:01:15.810> of<00:01:15.840> these<00:01:16.080> like

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
submarine oh yeah none of these like

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.190 
submarine oh yeah none of these like
stairs<00:01:16.740> for<00:01:17.130> them<00:01:17.299> like<00:01:18.299> you<00:01:18.509> know<00:01:18.630> when<00:01:19.020> the

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
stairs for them like you know when the

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.350 
stairs for them like you know when the
engineers<00:01:19.860> have<00:01:20.070> to<00:01:20.189> go<00:01:20.310> up<00:01:20.549> to<00:01:20.820> the<00:01:20.939> submarine

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
engineers have to go up to the submarine

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.330 
engineers have to go up to the submarine
to<00:01:21.509> check<00:01:21.750> what's<00:01:21.990> probably<00:01:22.650> more<00:01:22.920> pixie

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
to check what's probably more pixie

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.580 
to check what's probably more pixie
stuff<00:01:23.610> they<00:01:24.180> could<00:01:24.360> go<00:01:24.540> all<00:01:24.780> the<00:01:24.930> way<00:01:24.960> that<00:01:25.350> way

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
stuff they could go all the way that way

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.910 
stuff they could go all the way that way
and<00:01:26.130> probably<00:01:26.490> some<00:01:26.729> some<00:01:26.970> of<00:01:27.060> these

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:27.920 
and probably some some of these

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:31.460 
and probably some some of these
villagers<00:01:29.240> on<00:01:30.240> the<00:01:30.390> other<00:01:30.509> side<00:01:30.840> was<00:01:31.079> in<00:01:31.259> here

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
villagers on the other side was in here

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.760 
villagers on the other side was in here
I<00:01:31.740> think<00:01:32.159> it's<00:01:32.310> the<00:01:32.460> other<00:01:32.490> sub<00:01:33.560> right<00:01:34.560> and

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
I think it's the other sub right and

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.490 
I think it's the other sub right and
this<00:01:35.310> one<00:01:35.520> because<00:01:36.150> it's<00:01:36.360> moving<00:01:36.780> the<00:01:37.200> stairs

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
this one because it's moving the stairs

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.950 
this one because it's moving the stairs
this<00:01:37.680> movie<00:01:37.920> moved<00:01:38.759> away<00:01:38.939> from<00:01:39.119> the<00:01:39.479> sub<00:01:39.689> it's

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:33.360 
behind the scenes like all the powers
all<00:02:31.480> the<00:02:31.720> energy<00:02:32.170> goes<00:02:32.410> to<00:02:32.440> these<00:02:32.800> submarines

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
all the energy goes to these submarines

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:35.730 
all the energy goes to these submarines
will<00:02:33.700> be<00:02:33.850> fixed<00:02:34.270> in<00:02:34.420> here<00:02:34.720> as<00:02:34.930> you<00:02:35.530> can<00:02:35.560> see

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.130 
control room in here and stuff like this

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:10.950 
control room in here and stuff like this
right<00:03:06.450> and<00:03:07.830> this<00:03:08.830> is<00:03:09.040> stuff<00:03:09.450> daylight<00:03:10.450> sensors

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:10.960 
right and this is stuff daylight sensors

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:15.090 
right and this is stuff daylight sensors
loads<00:03:11.890> and<00:03:12.220> loads<00:03:12.280> of<00:03:12.730> buttons<00:03:12.910> load<00:03:13.950> lots<00:03:14.950> of

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:15.100 
loads and loads of buttons load lots of

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:17.550 
loads and loads of buttons load lots of
stuff<00:03:15.460> to<00:03:15.910> look<00:03:16.090> like<00:03:16.330> a<00:03:16.600> control<00:03:17.020> room<00:03:17.200> and<00:03:17.410> I
