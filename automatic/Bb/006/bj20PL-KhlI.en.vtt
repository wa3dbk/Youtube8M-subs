00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
going to be at an angle because at the

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.229 
going to be at an angle because at the
beginning<00:00:30.929> of<00:00:31.260> the<00:00:31.410> hairline<00:00:31.859> that<00:00:32.279> was<00:00:33.090> that

beginning of the hairline that was that

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:36.440
