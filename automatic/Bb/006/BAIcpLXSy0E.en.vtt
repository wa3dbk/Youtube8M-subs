00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:02.520
 Today the choice of cars is so much 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:04.190
 great that stopping at any 

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:06.819
 specific is not so easy here 

00:00:06.819 --> 00:00:09.240
 a clear understanding of exactly what you want 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:10.860
 get just a remedy 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:12.740
 movement of cars throughout 

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:15.619
 family or image details, I decided 

00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:17.690
 understand this by the example of two models 

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:19.830
 one brand good morning my name is village 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:21.939
 Pushkin you look so drive 

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:24.319
 in front of us Volvo s40 and pain in response 

00:00:24.319 --> 00:00:26.499
 sixty seemingly and outwardly they are not 

00:00:26.499 --> 00:00:28.210
 very different and costs about 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:30.719
 equally however I intended them 

00:00:30.719 --> 00:00:33.190
 completely different goals after 40 most 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:34.890
 Volvo's compact sedan 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.040
 at the same time he looks solid 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:38.850
 will seem like a black sheep in the parking lot 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.079
 expensive restaurant and prestigious business 

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:43.430
 center by the way about parking a small 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:45.650
 over 40 sea and these fitness she is narrow 

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:48.540
 parking a novice driver and even more so 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:50.340
 modest dimensions only 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:51.350
 on hand 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:53.220
 in a press of a dozen in the model range 

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:55.170
 Volvo companies hold more 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.650
 high position it is noticeably larger and 

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:00.230
 look much bigger externally 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:02.020
 models are very similar to each other but 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:04.040
 each is good in her own way 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:05.280
 but this period 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.230
 you definitely won't confuse 

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:09.450
 but I started sas 40 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.110
 here the design is more vivid and extraordinary 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:14.060
 created decorates nontrivial 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:15.880
 center console representing 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:18.580
 plate for which designer protection 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:20.740
 no one has applied this solution 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:22.780
 finishes for nothing that the car is small and here 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:25.080
 the very same quality 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.060
 inside China 5 60 not so brave this 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:30.040
 salon compared to the fatal separated 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:31.790
 more strict and concise 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:33.800
 these character differences are so similar 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:34.549
 cars 

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:35.740
 we for sure felt 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:38.889
 movements start with 40 fly off anyone touch on 

00:01:38.889 --> 00:01:41.889
 the gas pedal is 40 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:44.990
 Here and the speedometer passes 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:46.869
 mark 100 kilometers per hour and 

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:47.690
 automatic five-speed 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:50.280
 the box does not slow down the work 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.369
 delays in the transition to 

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:54.780
 the transmission is minimal, but on the suspension 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.759
 four-wheel drive export steering 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:58.060
 management allows you to receive 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:00.320
 driving pleasure with us 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:03.620
 temperament 41 7 very hot 

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:05.190
 nobody's surprising what 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:07.160
 will bring analytics cylinder 

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:09.140
 turbocharged engine at work 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:10.630
 moment two and a half years 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:14.110
 running 230 horsepower for so much 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:16.250
 compact sedan is a record 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:17.379
 power 

00:02:17.379 --> 00:02:20.120
 under the hood costs 60 x installed with the same 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:21.969
 five-cylinder turbo engine volume 

00:02:21.969 --> 00:02:23.809
 two and a half liters but his 

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:26.779
 power less than 250 horsepower 

00:02:26.779 --> 00:02:30.019
 Acceleration to hundreds takes about 2 

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:32.569
 and more money than two and three hours 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:35.349
 the format is a little more strangled steering 

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:37.569
 control of such a country suspension more 

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:40.739
 comfortable because on 5 60 doesn't want to notice on 

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:42.870
 all couples he is steve and solid discounts 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:44.699
 detachment under the drivers 

00:02:44.699 --> 00:02:46.219
 provoke compliance 

00:02:46.219 --> 00:02:48.389
 speed limit 

00:02:48.389 --> 00:02:50.939
 So I think now it became clear that when 

00:02:50.939 --> 00:02:52.060
 car selection 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:53.910
 the most important factor is not 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:56.599
 so much price or treasure only tasks that 

00:02:56.599 --> 00:02:58.680
 we put someone in front of him about the site 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:59.870
 sure center
