00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:32.970

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:36.120
 on the tec.it also 3.3 or 3.2 the same 

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:37.590

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:41.670
 b lecce in the sense that it cannot be 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:43.200
 pass that this bug and will stay for 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.540
 a little time 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.430

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.700
 put it here you see it doesn't burst 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.590

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:12.570

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.420
