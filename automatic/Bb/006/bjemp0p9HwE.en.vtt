00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
probably was in another level but I

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.910 
probably was in another level but I

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:10.820 
yeah that was a breakable floor and I

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:13.370 
yeah that was a breakable floor and I
should<00:01:11.820> be<00:01:11.850> going<00:01:12.119> down<00:01:12.479> because<00:01:12.630> it<00:01:13.020> leads

should be going down because it leads

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.039 
should be going down because it leads
down<00:01:13.830> as<00:01:14.159> do<00:01:14.340> most<00:01:14.520> floors<00:01:14.970> but<00:01:15.630> it's<00:01:15.780> a<00:01:15.840> secret
