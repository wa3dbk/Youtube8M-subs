00:01:12.749 --> 00:01:12.759 
might want to keep rapidly pressing your

00:01:12.759 --> 00:01:17.580 
might want to keep rapidly pressing your
r-1<00:01:13.240> button<00:01:13.270> and<00:01:14.229> to<00:01:14.649> just<00:01:16.229> you<00:01:17.229> know<00:01:17.350> keep

r-1 button and to just you know keep

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:20.010 
r-1 button and to just you know keep
keep<00:01:17.619> the<00:01:17.920> bald<00:01:18.100> spot<00:01:18.429> flying<00:01:19.149> forward

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:20.020 
keep the bald spot flying forward

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:23.929 
keep the bald spot flying forward
it<00:01:21.009> makes<00:01:21.189> it<00:01:21.310> a<00:01:21.340> little<00:01:21.429> easier<00:01:21.670> for<00:01:21.909> you<00:01:22.119> oh

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:27.100 
that's so weird of advice see I did not

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:29.370 
that's so weird of advice see I did not
know<00:01:27.429> this<00:01:27.670> when<00:01:28.090> I<00:01:28.119> first<00:01:28.630> tried<00:01:28.810> this<00:01:29.049> level

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:29.380 
know this when I first tried this level

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:31.859 
know this when I first tried this level
and<00:01:29.770> that's<00:01:30.459> why<00:01:30.759> I'm<00:01:31.119> not<00:01:31.420> going<00:01:31.600> to<00:01:31.689> be<00:01:31.780> able

00:01:31.859 --> 00:01:31.869 
and that's why I'm not going to be able

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:33.690 
and that's why I'm not going to be able
to<00:01:32.049> get<00:01:32.170> to<00:01:32.350> all<00:01:32.380> the<00:01:32.709> bubbles<00:01:32.860> coming<00:01:33.369> in<00:01:33.459> here

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:33.700 
to get to all the bubbles coming in here

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:36.090 
to get to all the bubbles coming in here
on<00:01:33.880> my<00:01:33.969> first<00:01:34.240> try<00:01:34.509> I<00:01:34.899> do<00:01:35.380> have<00:01:35.590> to<00:01:35.709> do<00:01:35.860> it<00:01:35.979> two

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:36.100 
on my first try I do have to do it two

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:38.880 
on my first try I do have to do it two
tries<00:01:36.420> if<00:01:37.420> you<00:01:37.659> push<00:01:37.959> hard<00:01:38.289> on<00:01:38.530> anything

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:38.890 
tries if you push hard on anything

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:41.429 
tries if you push hard on anything
you'll<00:01:39.459> die<00:01:39.700> right<00:01:40.200> like<00:01:41.200> that

00:01:41.429 --> 00:01:41.439 
you'll die right like that

00:01:41.439 --> 00:01:43.440 
you'll die right like that
see<00:01:42.220> and<00:01:42.340> I<00:01:42.399> did<00:01:42.579> not<00:01:42.670> know<00:01:42.880> that<00:01:42.909> and<00:01:43.360> I

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:43.450 
see and I did not know that and I

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:46.649 
see and I did not know that and I
completely<00:01:44.049> mess<00:01:44.229> up<00:01:44.409> this<00:01:44.530> entire<00:01:44.950> area<00:01:45.659> so

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:46.659 
completely mess up this entire area so

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:48.479 
completely mess up this entire area so
there's<00:01:47.140> lots<00:01:47.409> of<00:01:47.500> blank<00:01:47.739> levels<00:01:48.099> here<00:01:48.250> that

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:48.489 
there's lots of blank levels here that

00:01:48.489 --> 00:01:53.419 
there's lots of blank levels here that
you<00:01:48.610> can<00:01:48.700> see<00:01:50.099> see<00:01:51.099> once<00:01:51.340> again<00:01:51.489> push<00:01:51.939> hard<00:01:52.209> die

00:01:53.419 --> 00:01:53.429 
you can see see once again push hard die

00:01:53.429 --> 00:01:56.819 
you can see see once again push hard die
so<00:01:54.429> I've<00:01:55.090> not<00:01:55.360> know<00:01:55.569> that<00:01:55.750> first<00:01:56.110> that<00:01:56.470> make<00:01:56.679> me

00:01:56.819 --> 00:01:56.829 
so I've not know that first that make me

00:01:56.829 --> 00:01:59.789 
so I've not know that first that make me
screw<00:01:57.069> up<00:01:57.659> when<00:01:58.659> you<00:01:58.780> do<00:01:58.929> this<00:01:59.079> area<00:01:59.500> don't

00:01:59.789 --> 00:01:59.799 
screw up when you do this area don't

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:01.800 
screw up when you do this area don't
push<00:02:00.009> I<00:02:00.310> know<00:02:00.579> you're<00:02:00.880> inside<00:02:01.239> there<00:02:01.509> running

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:01.810 
push I know you're inside there running

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:04.050 
push I know you're inside there running
in<00:02:01.959> there<00:02:02.140> mobilize<00:02:02.619> levels<00:02:03.039> but<00:02:03.640> just<00:02:03.939> give

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:04.060 
in there mobilize levels but just give

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:06.449 
in there mobilize levels but just give
it<00:02:04.149> a<00:02:04.209> shot<00:02:04.509> so<00:02:04.840> I'm<00:02:04.929> gonna<00:02:05.020> go<00:02:05.200> back<00:02:05.439> and<00:02:05.799> I'll

00:02:06.449 --> 00:02:06.459 
it a shot so I'm gonna go back and I'll

00:02:06.459 --> 00:02:11.610 
it a shot so I'm gonna go back and I'll
show<00:02:06.759> you<00:02:06.789> right<00:02:07.030> here<00:02:10.139> so<00:02:11.139> see<00:02:11.380> I'm<00:02:11.500> not

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:11.620 
show you right here so see I'm not

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:13.110 
show you right here so see I'm not
pushing<00:02:11.859> hard<00:02:12.069> this<00:02:12.250> time<00:02:12.519> so<00:02:12.819> there's<00:02:12.970> gonna

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
pushing hard this time so there's gonna

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:16.350 
pushing hard this time so there's gonna
be<00:02:13.209> some<00:02:13.269> here

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:21.390 

now<00:02:16.930> you<00:02:16.990> can<00:02:17.170> get<00:02:17.290> the<00:02:17.410> ones<00:02:17.620> inside<00:02:17.920> circle

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.550 

and<00:02:21.640> I<00:02:22.090> get<00:02:22.269> the<00:02:22.390> fitted<00:02:22.690> bottom<00:02:23.019> but<00:02:23.170> I<00:02:23.230> forget

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560 
and I get the fitted bottom but I forget

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:25.320 
and I get the fitted bottom but I forget
that<00:02:23.739> there's<00:02:23.920> one<00:02:24.129> Stillman<00:02:24.640> top<00:02:24.849> left<00:02:25.120> over

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:25.330 
that there's one Stillman top left over

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:29.089 
that there's one Stillman top left over
so<00:02:26.200> they<00:02:26.349> don't<00:02:26.590> get<00:02:26.739> that<00:02:26.769> one<00:02:27.069> right<00:02:27.370> now<00:02:27.700> I

00:02:29.089 --> 00:02:29.099 
so they don't get that one right now I

all out another hard part of this world

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:36.220 
all out another hard part of this world
would<00:03:33.890> be<00:03:33.920> when<00:03:34.280> the<00:03:34.459> speed<00:03:34.700> increases<00:03:35.230> so

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:36.230 
would be when the speed increases so

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:37.150 
would be when the speed increases so
you're<00:03:36.379> gonna<00:03:36.530> have<00:03:36.650> a<00:03:36.709> little<00:03:36.890> bit<00:03:37.040> of<00:03:37.129> a

00:03:56.259 --> 00:03:56.269 
straight through so now that this part

00:03:56.269 --> 00:03:58.990 
straight through so now that this part
is<00:03:56.510> actually<00:03:57.049> a<00:03:57.290> flip<00:03:57.709> of<00:03:57.920> the<00:03:58.099> side<00:03:58.640> spoiler

00:03:58.990 --> 00:03:59.000 
is actually a flip of the side spoiler

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.140

00:04:42.689 --> 00:04:42.699 
area so try to stick in the center of

00:04:42.699 --> 00:04:45.029 
area so try to stick in the center of
all<00:04:42.850> these<00:04:43.000> little<00:04:43.120> passages<00:04:43.720> this<00:04:43.990> can<00:04:44.889> get
