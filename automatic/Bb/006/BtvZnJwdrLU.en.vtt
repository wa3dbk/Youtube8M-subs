00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.339 
ahead and scrape away on a surface
basically<00:00:27.130> to<00:00:27.460> re-orientate<00:00:28.300> this<00:00:28.689> 2d<00:00:29.109> plane

00:00:29.339 --> 00:00:29.349 
basically to re-orientate this 2d plane

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:30.990 
basically to re-orientate this 2d plane
as<00:00:29.529> you<00:00:29.619> can<00:00:29.800> see<00:00:30.009> in<00:00:30.250> the<00:00:30.429> viewport<00:00:30.640> and

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:31.000 
as you can see in the viewport and

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.390 
as you can see in the viewport and
moving<00:00:31.420> it<00:00:31.509> around<00:00:31.599> now<00:00:31.929> is<00:00:32.259> to<00:00:33.010> right-click

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:33.400 
moving it around now is to right-click

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:35.790 
moving it around now is to right-click
on<00:00:33.940> the<00:00:34.690> surface<00:00:35.050> and<00:00:35.230> you<00:00:35.290> can<00:00:35.470> see<00:00:35.650> it's

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:35.800 
on the surface and you can see it's

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:40.530 
on the surface and you can see it's
going<00:00:35.920> deeper<00:00:36.519> and<00:00:36.870> now<00:00:37.870> shallower<00:00:39.390> from<00:00:40.390> the

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:40.540 
going deeper and now shallower from the

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:42.390 
going deeper and now shallower from the
camera<00:00:40.839> if<00:00:41.229> I<00:00:41.470> hold<00:00:41.739> down<00:00:41.890> the<00:00:42.190> right<00:00:42.339> mouse

button and you'll see that it's

00:00:44.799 --> 00:00:47.070 
button and you'll see that it's
adjusting<00:00:45.220> on<00:00:45.339> the<00:00:45.400> fly<00:00:45.659> now<00:00:46.659> let's

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:47.080 
adjusting on the fly now let's

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:50.180 
adjusting on the fly now let's
demonstrate<00:00:47.610> what<00:00:48.610> exactly<00:00:49.119> this<00:00:49.239> tool<00:00:49.449> does

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
demonstrate what exactly this tool does

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.979 
demonstrate what exactly this tool does
according<00:00:51.190> to<00:00:51.309> the<00:00:51.430> depth<00:00:51.670> it<00:00:51.970> will<00:00:52.360> chop<00:00:52.780> off

00:00:52.979 --> 00:00:52.989 
according to the depth it will chop off

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:56.579 
according to the depth it will chop off
from<00:00:53.920> the<00:00:54.070> 2d<00:00:54.339> plane<00:00:54.610> toward<00:00:55.030> the<00:00:55.150> camera<00:00:55.589> now

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:56.589 
from the 2d plane toward the camera now

00:00:56.589 --> 00:00:59.939 
from the 2d plane toward the camera now
if<00:00:56.860> we<00:00:57.510> have<00:00:58.510> a<00:00:58.540> higher<00:00:58.809> depth<00:00:59.140> that<00:00:59.260> will<00:00:59.439> chop

00:00:59.939 --> 00:00:59.949 
if we have a higher depth that will chop

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:02.369 
if we have a higher depth that will chop
off<00:01:00.100> more<00:01:00.430> so<00:01:01.239> let's<00:01:01.390> go<00:01:01.510> ahead<00:01:01.540> and<00:01:01.720> just<00:01:02.260> have

00:01:02.369 --> 00:01:02.379 
off more so let's go ahead and just have

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:05.730 
off more so let's go ahead and just have
it<00:01:02.530> 100<00:01:03.010> here<00:01:03.220> and<00:01:03.519> I'll<00:01:03.939> demonstrate<00:01:04.740> that

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:05.740 
it 100 here and I'll demonstrate that

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:08.429 
it 100 here and I'll demonstrate that
you<00:01:06.280> can<00:01:06.460> see<00:01:06.670> it's<00:01:06.880> cut<00:01:07.600> off<00:01:07.720> a<00:01:07.750> flat<00:01:08.170> surface

00:01:08.429 --> 00:01:08.439 
you can see it's cut off a flat surface

00:01:08.439 --> 00:01:12.090 
you can see it's cut off a flat surface
there<00:01:08.880> according<00:01:09.880> to<00:01:10.149> the<00:01:10.390> orientation<00:01:11.170> for

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:12.100 
there according to the orientation for

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:14.130 
there according to the orientation for
where<00:01:12.250> i<00:01:12.280> right<00:01:12.579> clicked<00:01:12.820> it<00:01:12.990> dependent<00:01:13.990> on

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:14.140 
where i right clicked it dependent on

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:17.700 
where i right clicked it dependent on
the<00:01:14.229> camera<00:01:14.850> now<00:01:15.850> let's<00:01:16.390> go<00:01:16.539> ahead<00:01:16.689> and<00:01:17.020> rotate

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:17.710 
the camera now let's go ahead and rotate

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:19.260 
the camera now let's go ahead and rotate
the<00:01:17.829> view<00:01:17.859> and<00:01:18.100> you'll<00:01:18.280> see<00:01:18.549> that<00:01:18.759> it's<00:01:19.000> still

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:19.270 
the view and you'll see that it's still

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:21.929 
the view and you'll see that it's still
orientated<00:01:19.990> in<00:01:20.140> that<00:01:20.320> same<00:01:20.530> position<00:01:20.770> if<00:01:21.670> we

00:01:21.929 --> 00:01:21.939 
orientated in that same position if we

00:01:21.939 --> 00:01:24.179 
orientated in that same position if we
right<00:01:22.600> click<00:01:22.630> over<00:01:23.049> here<00:01:23.079> and<00:01:23.530> do<00:01:23.829> the<00:01:23.979> same

right click over here and do the same

00:01:24.189 --> 00:01:29.130 
right click over here and do the same
thing<00:01:24.659> and<00:01:25.659> then<00:01:26.499> we<00:01:27.119> readjusted<00:01:28.140> still

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:29.140 
thing and then we readjusted still

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:33.719 
thing and then we readjusted still
chopped<00:01:29.469> off<00:01:29.710> that<00:01:30.009> section<00:01:31.979> and<00:01:32.979> one<00:01:33.549> last

00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:33.729 
chopped off that section and one last

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:37.020 
chopped off that section and one last
thing<00:01:33.880> to<00:01:34.119> demonstrate<00:01:34.569> here<00:01:34.719> with<00:01:35.880> the<00:01:36.880> way

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:37.030 
thing to demonstrate here with the way

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:39.779 
thing to demonstrate here with the way
this<00:01:37.179> tool<00:01:37.509> operates<00:01:38.049> let's<00:01:38.590> select<00:01:38.979> another

00:01:39.779 --> 00:01:39.789 
this tool operates let's select another

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:43.800 
this tool operates let's select another
larger<00:01:40.450> area<00:01:40.840> again<00:01:41.759> and<00:01:42.759> this<00:01:43.240> time<00:01:43.299> turn<00:01:43.689> the

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:43.810 
larger area again and this time turn the

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:47.219 
larger area again and this time turn the
depth<00:01:44.109> down<00:01:45.299> all<00:01:46.299> right<00:01:46.539> right<00:01:46.749> around<00:01:46.899> fifty

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:47.229 
depth down all right right around fifty

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:49.169 
depth down all right right around fifty
percent<00:01:47.530> should<00:01:47.740> work<00:01:47.920> and<00:01:48.219> you'll<00:01:48.939> see<00:01:49.149> that

00:01:49.169 --> 00:01:49.179 
percent should work and you'll see that

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:51.179 
percent should work and you'll see that
it's<00:01:49.450> not<00:01:49.569> actually<00:01:49.990> cutting<00:01:50.229> off<00:01:50.619> all<00:01:50.829> of

00:01:51.179 --> 00:01:51.189 
it's not actually cutting off all of

00:01:51.189 --> 00:01:53.789 
it's not actually cutting off all of
that<00:01:51.310> surface<00:01:51.749> it<00:01:52.749> actually<00:01:53.020> left<00:01:53.409> some<00:01:53.560> of<00:01:53.649> it

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:53.799 
that surface it actually left some of it

00:01:53.799 --> 00:01:56.459 
that surface it actually left some of it
so<00:01:54.700> that<00:01:54.729> depends<00:01:55.359> on<00:01:55.420> the<00:01:55.539> depth<00:01:55.810> that<00:01:56.139> you

00:01:56.459 --> 00:01:56.469 
so that depends on the depth that you

00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:58.440 
so that depends on the depth that you
have<00:01:56.619> selected<00:01:56.909> now<00:01:57.909> let's<00:01:58.090> go<00:01:58.210> ahead<00:01:58.329> and

00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:58.450 
have selected now let's go ahead and

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:00.300 
have selected now let's go ahead and
cover<00:01:59.079> some<00:01:59.350> of<00:01:59.380> the<00:01:59.499> parameters<00:01:59.710> of<00:02:00.039> this

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:00.310 
cover some of the parameters of this

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:04.830 
cover some of the parameters of this

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:08.560 
action the default is pick point and for

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:11.070 
action the default is pick point and for
direction<00:02:09.069> it<00:02:09.459> will<00:02:09.640> re<00:02:09.880> orientate<00:02:10.660> the<00:02:10.810> plane

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:11.080 
direction it will re orientate the plane

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:13.700 
direction it will re orientate the plane
based<00:02:11.830> on<00:02:12.069> the<00:02:12.220> voxel<00:02:12.640> that<00:02:12.790> you<00:02:12.880> click<00:02:13.120> on<00:02:13.270> and

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
based on the voxel that you click on and

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:16.500 
based on the voxel that you click on and
the<00:02:14.710> camera<00:02:15.070> so<00:02:15.340> it<00:02:15.400> will<00:02:15.490> always<00:02:15.640> be<00:02:15.790> parallel

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510
