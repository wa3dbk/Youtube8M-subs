00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:05.960
 hello very good everyone I am a people 

00:00:02.659 --> 00:00:08.780
 that I bring you a new video and good 

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:12.920
 Today I bring after a month and without 

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:15.710
 upload videos of this series today I bring you 

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:19.220
 the new chapter of the series of 

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:24.140
 improving in gears of war chapter 7 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:26.500
 episode 7 good in this video we're going 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:26.500
 to 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.410
 to see what the grenades of 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:34.380
 smoke is worth 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:36.690
 it seems that the smoke grenade does not have 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:39.120
 very useful but in reality as 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:42.460
 let's see in this video yes it has 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:45.309
 it extremely useful 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:49.340
 well let's start and well then the 

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:51.920
 first example would be this which is 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:54.140
 that almost everyone uses it 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:56.450
 well there you see that the enemy is going 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:59.620
 towards some goals it may already be catching 

00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:03.350
 a weapon or it can already be capture a 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:05.010
 ring or an annex and stretch the the 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:08.850
 smoke grenade 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:10.650
 so that to stun the enemy and 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.620
 while the enemy is stunned can 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:15.720
 kill him not kill them easily and good 

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:18.510
 Well here we have another example because 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:21.990
 They can serve us in the smoke dinner 

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:23.340
 because they can be very useful and 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.230
 above all, it is very useful for 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:28.620
 snipers here you see that I was 

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:30.780
 pointing to the side with the sniper and 

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:32.850
 I would advise you that if I am going to stay 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.710
 in a position with the sniper I would put you 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.320
 there always a smoke grenade back 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:40.310
 because then because like that if some enemy 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:42.900
 comes to attack us from behind 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:44.760
 we will be able to know if they come to us worth in 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:47.580
 this case you have already seen the enemy 

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:50.250
 ate the smoke grenade stays 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:53.400
 stunned and we could quickly 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:56.430
 change weapon to the nasser and kill him 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:58.950
 super easy, so if you're going to 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:02.280
 stay with sniper in a possible option 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:04.619
 it is therefore recommended that you have 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:07.800
 a smoke grenade because it's behind 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:09.570
 be worth covering the rear and 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:11.440
 Well, here we have another example 

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:14.530
 in this example we are going to see 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:17.320
 as we heard that an enemy followed us 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:18.070
 back and throw a grenade against a 

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:20.470
 wall 

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:23.200
 calculating where the grenade will fall 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:27.400
 so that it just stuns the enemy and so 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:30.370
 to be able to kill it super easy and with 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:32.070
 sure that we will have enough 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:34.040
 advantage not because the enemy will be 

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:36.409
 stunned 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:38.659
 I 'm better off doing that than directly 

00:02:36.409 --> 00:02:41.520
 to turn around with wool be because I think 

00:02:38.659 --> 00:02:44.610
 that if we turn around directly 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:46.890
 without stunning it, the enemy is going to have 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:49.500
 advantage since it will be in front 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:52.020
 ours and we will have to give ourselves 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:53.940
 turn around and look at what position 

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:55.770
 it's exactly point and kill him 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:57.870
 then I see better doing one 

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:59.790
 grenade against the wall calculating that 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:02.100
 when it explodes, the 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:04.200
 enemy and so he is sure that 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:07.170
 we are going to have an advantage over him and 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:10.590
 kill him easily is good and here a 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:12.570
 new example in this example we 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:16.140
 we fix that behind the sacks we see 

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:18.360
 so the humiliation of the grenades and not 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:20.190
 we have enough angle to 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:22.320
 shoot the grenade and it explodes 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:26.430
 then what we have done has been 

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:28.680
 throw a smoke grenade so that the 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:32.130
 enemy grenade explode and thus kill 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:34.320
 all the enemies that are worth this is 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:40.130
 a very good option if we do not have the 

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:44.030
 shooting angle to be able to shoot and what 

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:45.740
 to the enemy mine bust good here 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:49.450
 another example 

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:52.220
 here we kill the good enemy we beat it 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:53.990
 we take the body we use it as a shield 

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:56.480
 and here we meet another enemy 

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:58.400
 what do we do then we throw him 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:00.710
 enemy with a smoke bomb the enemy 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:02.720
 he is stunned and we can kill him with 

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:05.000
 ease this example I've put it 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:08.300
 because there are many people who forget it 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:10.370
 that you can do that not and what it does 

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:12.890
 is to start shooting him to shoot him with 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:15.020
 the gun and such a good one because I 

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:17.690
 I advise that is the enemy is half 

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:18.950
 distance like that at a distance like 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:21.170
 that I have had against this 

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:24.290
 enemy I recommend that you cast the 

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:27.890
 body because surely it's worth 

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:30.350
 surely give him and if the tournÃ©e 

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:32.870
 you are going to kill almost certainly it will be 

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:35.810
 at a disadvantage will not be able to do anything and 

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:37.370
 also going to walk slow so good 

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:39.170
 I advise you that if you are at that 

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:40.490
 distance more or less than you set the 

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:43.430
 body with a 

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:46.130
 a bait of smoke no and well then 

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:48.800
 up to here episode 7 of the series of 

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:51.650
 improving in kills or word remember if 

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:54.020
 you want me to make a video explaining 

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:56.599
 os something concrete that you want 

00:04:54.020 --> 00:05:00.020
 learn to do that you do not know how to do and 

00:04:56.599 --> 00:05:02.419
 that you want to learn to do not me and 

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:05.270
 them to do it well I am delighted 

00:05:02.419 --> 00:05:06.889
 I taught him nothing and hope you people 

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:09.770
 I liked the video I hope that you 

00:05:06.889 --> 00:05:13.210
 has been helpful and see you in the 

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:13.210
 next video see you later
