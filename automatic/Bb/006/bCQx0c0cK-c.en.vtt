I<00:02:05.720> set<00:02:05.960> realistic<00:02:06.320> goals<00:02:07.300> but<00:02:08.300> what<00:02:08.420> I

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:08.450 
I set realistic goals but what I

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:10.810 
I set realistic goals but what I
realized<00:02:08.899> is<00:02:09.110> along<00:02:10.070> with<00:02:10.280> all<00:02:10.399> those<00:02:10.550> goals

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:10.820 
realized is along with all those goals

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:12.130 
realized is along with all those goals
they<00:02:11.000> were<00:02:11.060> going<00:02:11.209> to<00:02:11.300> be<00:02:11.360> obstacles<00:02:11.750> that<00:02:12.050> you

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:12.140 
they were going to be obstacles that you

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:13.420 
they were going to be obstacles that you
overcome<00:02:12.620> and<00:02:13.040> there<00:02:13.160> were<00:02:13.220> a<00:02:13.250> lot<00:02:13.400> of

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:17.180 
setbacks as well as positive so we have

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:18.610 
setbacks as well as positive so we have
