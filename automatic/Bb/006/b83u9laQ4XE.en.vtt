00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
more uses for a computer meaning the RT

cannot run older apps from previous
Windows<00:00:50.760> versions<00:00:51.329> so<00:00:52.110> it's<00:00:52.469> like<00:00:52.620> the<00:00:52.829> new

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
Windows versions so it's like the new

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:56.180 
Windows versions so it's like the new
it's<00:00:53.579> newer<00:00:53.969> so<00:00:54.449> it<00:00:54.539> can't<00:00:54.780> run<00:00:55.649> the<00:00:55.739> old<00:00:55.890> stuff

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
it's newer so it can't run the old stuff

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.849 
it's newer so it can't run the old stuff
that<00:00:56.219> you<00:00:56.699> probably<00:00:57.059> need<00:00:57.480> like<00:00:57.859> Photoshop

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859

more<00:01:47.970> different<00:01:48.659> stuff<00:01:48.930> that<00:01:49.110> your<00:01:49.259> computer

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
more different stuff that your computer

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
instead of having the RT where you can

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.149 
instead of having the RT where you can
just<00:01:57.750> get<00:01:58.110> the<00:01:58.619> stuff<00:01:58.860> that's<00:01:59.040> already

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
just get the stuff that's already

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.819 
just get the stuff that's already
pre-installed<00:01:59.549> for<00:02:00.450> it<00:02:00.570> so<00:02:00.810> it's<00:02:00.840> more<00:02:01.259> the

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
pre-installed for it so it's more the

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:05.179 
pre-installed for it so it's more the
pros<00:02:02.369> more<00:02:02.759> what's<00:02:03.630> the<00:02:03.780> word<00:02:03.810> I<00:02:04.200> don't<00:02:05.070> know

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
pros more what's the word I don't know

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:07.910 
pros more what's the word I don't know
how<00:02:05.340> to<00:02:05.399> like<00:02:05.969> I<00:02:06.299> don't<00:02:06.600> know<00:02:06.780> how<00:02:07.439> to<00:02:07.500> put<00:02:07.740> this

how to like I don't know how to put this

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.809 
how to like I don't know how to put this
but<00:02:07.979> like<00:02:08.280> it's<00:02:08.459> more<00:02:09.800> it's<00:02:10.800> good<00:02:11.069> for<00:02:11.099> school

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
but like it's more it's good for school

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:13.080 
but like it's more it's good for school
and<00:02:12.090> business

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
and business

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:14.400 
and business
because<00:02:13.239> you<00:02:13.360> have<00:02:13.540> all<00:02:13.780> the<00:02:14.019> apps<00:02:14.170> that

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:14.410 
because you have all the apps that

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:16.860 
because you have all the apps that
businesses<00:02:15.129> would<00:02:15.340> need<00:02:15.760> all<00:02:16.120> ready<00:02:16.599> for<00:02:16.690> the

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:16.870 
businesses would need all ready for the

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:19.020 
businesses would need all ready for the
windows<00:02:17.140> 8<00:02:17.590> pro<00:02:17.650> because<00:02:18.250> Windows<00:02:18.580> RT<00:02:18.730> might

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
windows 8 pro because Windows RT might

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:20.699 
windows 8 pro because Windows RT might
not<00:02:19.180> have<00:02:19.330> it<00:02:19.450> because<00:02:19.629> they<00:02:19.720> don't<00:02:19.900> have<00:02:19.959> some

00:02:20.699 --> 00:02:20.709 
not have it because they don't have some

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:22.979 
not have it because they don't have some
of<00:02:20.800> the<00:02:20.890> apps<00:02:21.040> that<00:02:21.280> your<00:02:21.519> work<00:02:22.030> might<00:02:22.330> rely<00:02:22.690> on

00:02:22.979 --> 00:02:22.989 
of the apps that your work might rely on

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:26.759 
of the apps that your work might rely on
so<00:02:23.470> that's<00:02:23.980> why<00:02:24.190> you<00:02:24.489> the<00:02:25.390> windows<00:02:25.720> 8<00:02:26.019> pro<00:02:26.050> is

00:02:26.759 --> 00:02:26.769 
so that's why you the windows 8 pro is

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:29.400 
so that's why you the windows 8 pro is
more<00:02:26.980> trusting<00:02:27.580> than<00:02:27.610> the<00:02:28.060> windows<00:02:28.390> RT<00:02:28.750> though

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:29.410 
more trusting than the windows RT though

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:31.860 
more trusting than the windows RT though
the<00:02:29.620> windows<00:02:29.890> RT<00:02:30.220> has<00:02:30.430> the<00:02:30.640> new<00:02:30.819> verb<00:02:31.150> its<00:02:31.420> new

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:31.870 
the windows RT has the new verb its new

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:35.580 
the windows RT has the new verb its new
so<00:02:32.260> it<00:02:32.440> has<00:02:32.560> some<00:02:33.430> different<00:02:33.849> stuff<00:02:34.060> but<00:02:34.590> you

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.590 
so it has some different stuff but you

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:39.330 
so it has some different stuff but you
know<00:02:35.739> the<00:02:36.010> windows<00:02:36.340> 8<00:02:36.519> pro<00:02:37.319> definitely<00:02:38.340> has

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:39.340 
know the windows 8 pro definitely has

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:40.979 
know the windows 8 pro definitely has
all<00:02:39.370> the<00:02:39.910> stuff<00:02:40.150> that<00:02:40.180> you've<00:02:40.510> probably<00:02:40.750> been

00:02:40.979 --> 00:02:40.989 
all the stuff that you've probably been

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:42.809 
all the stuff that you've probably been
looking<00:02:41.440> for<00:02:41.680> like<00:02:41.920> Steam<00:02:42.220> games<00:02:42.549> and

00:02:42.809 --> 00:02:42.819 
looking for like Steam games and

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:49.229 
looking for like Steam games and
everything<00:02:43.269> and<00:02:47.010> the<00:02:48.010> RT<00:02:48.400> is<00:02:48.459> more<00:02:48.760> for<00:02:49.000> fun

00:02:49.229 --> 00:02:49.239 
everything and the RT is more for fun

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:51.360 
everything and the RT is more for fun
uses<00:02:49.750> such<00:02:50.019> as<00:02:50.049> just<00:02:50.380> typing<00:02:50.590> documents<00:02:50.920> of

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:51.370 
uses such as just typing documents of

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:52.949 
uses such as just typing documents of
reading<00:02:51.640> emails<00:02:52.000> when<00:02:52.180> the<00:02:52.269> pro<00:02:52.420> can<00:02:52.630> just<00:02:52.810> do

00:02:52.949 --> 00:02:52.959 
reading emails when the pro can just do

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:56.750 
reading emails when the pro can just do
much<00:02:53.170> more<00:02:54.239> that's<00:02:55.239> pretty<00:02:55.540> much<00:02:55.750> like<00:02:55.930> the<00:02:56.049> RT

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
much more that's pretty much like the RT

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:00.150 
much more that's pretty much like the RT
can<00:02:57.760> do<00:02:58.450> like<00:02:58.780> obviously<00:02:59.379> a<00:02:59.500> lot<00:02:59.829> of<00:02:59.980> stuff

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:00.160 
can do like obviously a lot of stuff

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:01.710 
can do like obviously a lot of stuff
that<00:03:00.280> that<00:03:00.430> windows<00:03:00.700> 8<00:03:00.819> pro<00:03:00.849> but<00:03:01.390> like<00:03:01.569> I'm

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:01.720 
that that windows 8 pro but like I'm

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:05.270 
that that windows 8 pro but like I'm
gonna<00:03:01.989> say<00:03:02.200> it<00:03:02.319> again<00:03:02.579> the<00:03:03.579> windows<00:03:04.299> 8<00:03:04.420> pro<00:03:04.450> can

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
gonna say it again the windows 8 pro can

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.770 
gonna say it again the windows 8 pro can
just<00:03:06.280> pretty<00:03:06.519> much<00:03:06.700> do<00:03:06.970> what<00:03:07.120> a<00:03:07.150> computer<00:03:07.599> can

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:07.780 
just pretty much do what a computer can

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:13.740 
just pretty much do what a computer can
but<00:03:08.730> it's<00:03:10.049> smaller<00:03:11.049> it's<00:03:11.260> cheaper<00:03:12.129> and<00:03:12.510> it<00:03:13.510> has

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:13.750 
but it's smaller it's cheaper and it has

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:15.630 
but it's smaller it's cheaper and it has
some<00:03:14.049> pretty<00:03:14.349> different<00:03:14.650> stuff<00:03:14.980> also<00:03:15.340> which<00:03:15.519> I

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:15.640 
some pretty different stuff also which I

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:17.129 
some pretty different stuff also which I
might<00:03:15.819> be<00:03:15.910> able<00:03:16.000> to<00:03:16.180> go<00:03:16.390> over<00:03:16.660> in<00:03:16.750> a<00:03:16.840> different

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:17.139 
might be able to go over in a different

00:03:17.139 --> 00:03:19.620 
might be able to go over in a different
video<00:03:17.230> but<00:03:17.650> that's<00:03:18.220> really<00:03:18.370> all<00:03:18.760> I<00:03:18.819> wanted<00:03:19.540> to

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:19.630 
video but that's really all I wanted to

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:20.819 
video but that's really all I wanted to
go<00:03:19.720> over<00:03:19.750> in<00:03:20.049> this<00:03:20.079> video<00:03:20.410> the<00:03:20.440> difference

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:20.829 
go over in this video the difference

00:03:20.829 --> 00:03:23.460 
go over in this video the difference
between<00:03:20.920> the<00:03:21.160> RT<00:03:21.489> in<00:03:21.670> the<00:03:21.880> surface<00:03:22.630> so<00:03:23.079> for

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:23.470 
between the RT in the surface so for

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:25.740 
between the RT in the surface so for
gamers<00:03:23.859> the<00:03:24.519> pro<00:03:24.850> would<00:03:25.060> be<00:03:25.150> good<00:03:25.329> to<00:03:25.630> get

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:25.750 
gamers the pro would be good to get

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:28.530 
gamers the pro would be good to get
steam<00:03:26.260> stuff<00:03:26.620> also<00:03:27.340> for<00:03:27.819> business<00:03:28.209> the<00:03:28.359> pro

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:28.540 
steam stuff also for business the pro

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:30.629 
steam stuff also for business the pro
would<00:03:28.720> be<00:03:28.840> good<00:03:28.989> because<00:03:29.260> of<00:03:29.650> all<00:03:29.829> the<00:03:29.980> apps

00:03:30.629 --> 00:03:30.639 
would be good because of all the apps

00:03:30.639 --> 00:03:32.849 
would be good because of all the apps
that<00:03:31.000> you<00:03:31.120> might<00:03:31.299> need<00:03:31.599> from<00:03:32.230> previous

that you might need from previous

00:03:32.859 --> 00:03:34.470 
that you might need from previous
versions<00:03:33.400> that<00:03:33.549> you<00:03:33.609> can<00:03:33.700> just<00:03:34.030> get<00:03:34.209> right

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:36.579

00:03:43.389 --> 00:03:45.089 
can have that still even though you're
running<00:03:43.630> older<00:03:43.870> apps<00:03:44.049> it's<00:03:44.590> just<00:03:44.799> pretty<00:03:44.919> cool

00:03:45.089 --> 00:03:45.099 
running older apps it's just pretty cool

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:46.620 
running older apps it's just pretty cool
you<00:03:45.549> can<00:03:45.669> also<00:03:45.819> get<00:03:45.940> Photoshop<00:03:46.450> or

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:46.630 
you can also get Photoshop or

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:50.069 
you can also get Photoshop or
photography<00:03:47.530> people<00:03:47.859> and<00:03:48.160> you<00:03:49.000> know<00:03:49.120> the<00:03:49.780> RT

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:50.079 
photography people and you know the RT

00:03:50.079 --> 00:03:51.690 
photography people and you know the RT
doesn't<00:03:50.440> always<00:03:50.709> allow<00:03:50.829> that<00:03:51.010> kind<00:03:51.220> of<00:03:51.459> stuff

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:51.700 
doesn't always allow that kind of stuff

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:54.330 
doesn't always allow that kind of stuff
that's<00:03:51.849> why<00:03:52.319> the<00:03:53.319> pro<00:03:53.590> would<00:03:53.829> probably<00:03:54.190> be

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:54.340 
that's why the pro would probably be

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:56.610 
that's why the pro would probably be
your<00:03:54.489> best<00:03:54.669> choice<00:03:54.880> but<00:03:55.180> the<00:03:55.930> only<00:03:56.169> bad<00:03:56.590> thing

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:56.620 
your best choice but the only bad thing

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:58.379 
your best choice but the only bad thing
about<00:03:56.889> this<00:03:57.250> right<00:03:57.400> now<00:03:57.459> is<00:03:57.579> that<00:03:57.730> the<00:03:57.880> pro<00:03:58.120> is

00:03:58.379 --> 00:03:58.389 
about this right now is that the pro is

00:03:58.389 --> 00:03:59.629 
about this right now is that the pro is
probably<00:03:58.870> coming<00:03:59.079> out<00:03:59.230> around

00:03:59.629 --> 00:03:59.639 
probably coming out around

00:03:59.639 --> 00:04:03.240 
probably coming out around
january-february<00:04:00.639> next<00:04:01.389> year<00:04:01.510> 2013<00:04:02.260> when<00:04:03.069> the

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:03.250 
january-february next year 2013 when the

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:07.319 
january-february next year 2013 when the
RT<00:04:03.549> is<00:04:03.609> already<00:04:03.880> out<00:04:04.120> now<00:04:04.329> but<00:04:05.079> you<00:04:05.349> know<00:04:06.329> also

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:07.329 
RT is already out now but you know also

00:04:07.329 --> 00:04:08.670 
RT is already out now but you know also
one<00:04:07.480> more<00:04:07.510> thing<00:04:07.630> I<00:04:07.840> should<00:04:07.870> know<00:04:08.139> is<00:04:08.290> the<00:04:08.410> RT

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:08.680 
one more thing I should know is the RT

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:10.920 
one more thing I should know is the RT
is<00:04:08.829> a<00:04:08.859> bit<00:04:09.220> thinner<00:04:09.519> like<00:04:09.849> a<00:04:09.880> tiny<00:04:10.329> bit<00:04:10.510> thinner

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:10.930 
is a bit thinner like a tiny bit thinner

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:14.580 
is a bit thinner like a tiny bit thinner
but<00:04:11.620> the<00:04:12.299> screen<00:04:13.299> on<00:04:13.540> the<00:04:13.720> windows<00:04:14.049> 8<00:04:14.139> pro<00:04:14.169> is

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:14.590 
but the screen on the windows 8 pro is

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:17.250 
but the screen on the windows 8 pro is
better<00:04:15.130> so<00:04:15.549> I<00:04:15.790> wanted<00:04:16.359> to<00:04:16.479> say<00:04:16.630> that<00:04:16.780> the

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:17.260 
better so I wanted to say that the

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.770 
better so I wanted to say that the
reason<00:04:17.500> why<00:04:17.620> the<00:04:17.680> windows<00:04:18.310> 8<00:04:18.549> pro<00:04:18.609> version<00:04:19.599> is

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:19.780 
reason why the windows 8 pro version is

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:21.659 
reason why the windows 8 pro version is
thicker<00:04:20.349> is<00:04:20.500> because<00:04:20.829> the<00:04:20.919> processors<00:04:21.430> bigger

00:04:21.659 --> 00:04:21.669 
thicker is because the processors bigger

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:22.640 
thicker is because the processors bigger
cuz<00:04:21.880> it's<00:04:22.030> more<00:04:22.150> like

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:22.650 
cuz it's more like

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:24.499 
cuz it's more like
so<00:04:23.430> I<00:04:23.460> hope<00:04:23.729> you<00:04:23.820> guys<00:04:23.940> have<00:04:24.120> enjoyed<00:04:24.210> this
