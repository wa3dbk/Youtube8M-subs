00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
for a while I think probably everyone is

the cheapest floss that they have

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:10.410 
the cheapest floss that they have
is<00:02:07.990> the<00:02:08.110> unwaxed<00:02:08.550> so<00:02:09.550> it's<00:02:09.670> not<00:02:09.729> like<00:02:09.970> flavored

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:10.420 
is the unwaxed so it's not like flavored

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:12.570 
is the unwaxed so it's not like flavored
or<00:02:10.539> anything<00:02:10.899> and<00:02:11.200> just<00:02:11.230> take<00:02:12.040> it<00:02:12.190> and<00:02:12.310> wrap<00:02:12.459> it

around<00:02:12.640> my<00:02:12.760> finger<00:02:13.150> and<00:02:13.390> then<00:02:16.290> and<00:02:17.290> then<00:02:17.739> all

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:17.860 
around my finger and then and then all

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:19.860 
around my finger and then and then all
kinds<00:02:18.129> of<00:02:18.160> gross<00:02:18.370> stuff<00:02:18.670> comes<00:02:18.970> out<00:02:19.090> so<00:02:19.480> so<00:02:19.840> I

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 
kinds of gross stuff comes out so so I

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:20.910 
kinds of gross stuff comes out so so I
don't<00:02:20.170> know<00:02:20.230> if<00:02:20.260> my<00:02:20.349> teeth<00:02:20.590> are<00:02:20.739> so<00:02:20.890> white

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920 
don't know if my teeth are so white

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:24.390 
don't know if my teeth are so white
because<00:02:21.580> I<00:02:21.970> brush<00:02:22.599> them<00:02:22.629> regularly<00:02:23.230> or<00:02:23.590> if

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 
because I brush them regularly or if

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:27.570 
because I brush them regularly or if
it's<00:02:24.580> because<00:02:24.750> I<00:02:25.750> got<00:02:26.170> them<00:02:26.349> whitened<00:02:26.590> and<00:02:27.040> I

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:27.580 
it's because I got them whitened and I

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:30.270 
it's because I got them whitened and I
used<00:02:27.790> this<00:02:28.060> like<00:02:28.299> really<00:02:28.690> good<00:02:29.019> at<00:02:29.590> home
