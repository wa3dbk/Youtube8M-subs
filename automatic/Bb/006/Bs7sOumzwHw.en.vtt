yeah I'm gonna do we video as I'm trying
to<00:00:03.720> do<00:00:03.840> calves<00:00:04.080> as<00:00:04.319> you<00:00:04.410> can<00:00:04.559> see<00:00:04.680> right<00:00:04.829> here

00:00:04.849 --> 00:00:04.859 
to do calves as you can see right here

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:06.739 
to do calves as you can see right here
they're<00:00:05.579> not<00:00:05.609> the<00:00:05.789> arm<00:00:05.970> but<00:00:06.149> right<00:00:06.390> right

00:00:06.739 --> 00:00:06.749 
they're not the arm but right right

00:00:06.749 --> 00:00:09.890 
they're not the arm but right right
there<00:00:06.959> okay<00:00:07.379> so<00:00:08.040> I'm<00:00:08.849> gonna<00:00:09.000> do<00:00:09.210> a<00:00:09.240> quick<00:00:09.660> video

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 
there okay so I'm gonna do a quick video

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.039 
there okay so I'm gonna do a quick video
about<00:00:10.290> a<00:00:10.860> client<00:00:11.309> that<00:00:11.580> I<00:00:11.639> had<00:00:11.879> yesterday<00:00:12.059> but

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
about a client that I had yesterday but

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:15.350 
about a client that I had yesterday but
discussion<00:00:13.530> we<00:00:13.620> have<00:00:13.769> the<00:00:14.099> email<00:00:14.490> was<00:00:14.789> really

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
discussion we have the email was really

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.120 
discussion we have the email was really
really<00:00:15.539> fantastic

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
really fantastic

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.759 
really fantastic
see<00:00:17.880> cuz<00:00:18.240> I've<00:00:18.480> put<00:00:18.630> together<00:00:18.750> a<00:00:18.990> keto<00:00:19.410> plans

00:00:19.759 --> 00:00:19.769 
see cuz I've put together a keto plans

00:00:19.769 --> 00:00:22.580 
see cuz I've put together a keto plans
for<00:00:20.070> people<00:00:20.220> who<00:00:20.550> want<00:00:20.910> to<00:00:21.080> keep<00:00:22.080> their<00:00:22.260> brain

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
for people who want to keep their brain

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.609 
for people who want to keep their brain
and<00:00:22.980> their<00:00:23.310> body<00:00:24.119> to<00:00:24.570> understand<00:00:25.080> ketones

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
and their body to understand ketones

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.730 
and their body to understand ketones
which<00:00:26.009> is<00:00:26.429> a<00:00:26.460> very<00:00:26.910> even<00:00:27.390> burning<00:00:27.900> fuel<00:00:28.410> source

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
which is a very even burning fuel source

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.769 
which is a very even burning fuel source
which<00:00:29.339> takes<00:00:29.699> away<00:00:29.910> the<00:00:30.060> blood<00:00:30.210> sugar<00:00:30.570> this

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
which takes away the blood sugar this

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:32.780 
which takes away the blood sugar this
regulation<00:00:31.230> and<00:00:31.740> makes<00:00:32.220> you<00:00:32.340> feel<00:00:32.550> fantastic

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
regulation and makes you feel fantastic

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.460 
regulation and makes you feel fantastic
and<00:00:33.450> kills<00:00:33.630> your<00:00:33.780> whole<00:00:33.840> body<00:00:34.080> and<00:00:34.230> they<00:00:34.290> say

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:34.470 
and kills your whole body and they say

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:37.610 
and kills your whole body and they say
it<00:00:34.560> in<00:00:34.650> a<00:00:34.740> ton<00:00:34.920> of<00:00:34.950> videos<00:00:35.990> here<00:00:36.990> we<00:00:37.080> go

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
it in a ton of videos here we go

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.490 
it in a ton of videos here we go
so<00:00:38.100> she<00:00:38.760> decided<00:00:39.270> to<00:00:39.510> use<00:00:39.630> a<00:00:39.660> glucometer<00:00:40.080> which

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
so she decided to use a glucometer which

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.680 
so she decided to use a glucometer which
this<00:00:40.800> is<00:00:40.980> so<00:00:41.280> fascinating<00:00:42.030> so<00:00:42.240> listen<00:00:42.540> up

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
this is so fascinating so listen up

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:43.670 
this is so fascinating so listen up
check<00:00:43.080> this<00:00:43.200> out

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
check this out

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.450 
check this out
so<00:00:44.250> she<00:00:44.310> used<00:00:44.580> a<00:00:44.730> glucometer<00:00:45.120> for<00:00:45.570> 28<00:00:46.140> days

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:46.460 
so she used a glucometer for 28 days

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:49.990 
so she used a glucometer for 28 days
okay<00:00:47.490> your<00:00:47.760> ketone<00:00:48.270> rages<00:00:48.750> over<00:00:48.870> ranges<00:00:49.710> a

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:50.000 
okay your ketone rages over ranges a

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.100 
okay your ketone rages over ranges a
lower<00:00:51.000> level<00:00:51.300> of<00:00:51.450> ketosis<00:00:51.780> would<00:00:52.260> be<00:00:52.820> 0.5<00:00:53.930> to<00:00:54.930> 5

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
lower level of ketosis would be 0.5 to 5

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.250 
lower level of ketosis would be 0.5 to 5
now<00:00:55.470> you<00:00:55.530> could<00:00:55.770> go<00:00:55.920> up<00:00:55.950> to<00:00:56.310> 6<00:00:57.110> millimolar<00:00:58.110> x'

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
now you could go up to 6 millimolar x'

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.740 
now you could go up to 6 millimolar x'
it's<00:00:58.950> very<00:00:59.190> rare<00:00:59.520> but<00:00:59.550> you<00:00:59.910> can<00:01:00.180> and<00:01:00.540> if

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
it's very rare but you can and if

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.930 
it's very rare but you can and if
there's<00:01:01.020> no<00:01:01.230> acid<00:01:01.800> ketones<00:01:02.280> at<00:01:02.460> this<00:01:02.610> point

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
there's no acid ketones at this point

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:11.179 
there's no acid ketones at this point
but<00:01:03.540> 0.5<00:01:04.500> would<00:01:04.679> be<00:01:04.829> in<00:01:05.570> level<00:01:06.570> ketosis<00:01:10.189> okay

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
but 0.5 would be in level ketosis okay

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.039 
but 0.5 would be in level ketosis okay
so<00:01:11.250> that<00:01:11.579> that's<00:01:11.820> a<00:01:12.060> little<00:01:12.240> lower<00:01:12.539> level<00:01:12.899> that

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
so that that's a little lower level that

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.139 
so that that's a little lower level that
means<00:01:13.259> that<00:01:13.590> you<00:01:14.189> might<00:01:14.340> be<00:01:14.520> able<00:01:14.609> to<00:01:14.729> show

00:01:15.139 --> 00:01:15.149 
means that you might be able to show

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:18.380 
means that you might be able to show
registered<00:01:15.659> ketones<00:01:16.079> in<00:01:16.289> the<00:01:16.380> blood<00:01:16.770> but<00:01:17.609> your

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
registered ketones in the blood but your

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:23.179 
registered ketones in the blood but your
brain<00:01:18.659> is<00:01:18.689> not<00:01:18.990> able<00:01:19.679> to<00:01:20.249> viably<00:01:20.850> views<00:01:21.829> as<00:01:22.829> yet

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
brain is not able to viably views as yet

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.940 
brain is not able to viably views as yet
so<00:01:24.030> just<00:01:24.179> because<00:01:24.359> you've<00:01:24.600> registered<00:01:24.840> as<00:01:25.259> 0.5

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
so just because you've registered as 0.5

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.080 
so just because you've registered as 0.5
does<00:01:26.159> not<00:01:26.310> mean<00:01:26.490> that<00:01:26.520> your<00:01:26.820> high<00:01:26.939> level

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
does not mean that your high level

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.989 
does not mean that your high level
ketosis<00:01:27.659> here<00:01:28.409> we<00:01:28.560> go

00:01:28.989 --> 00:01:28.999 
ketosis here we go

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:32.359 
ketosis here we go
28<00:01:29.999> days<00:01:30.270> she<00:01:30.810> measured<00:01:31.200> ketones<00:01:31.799> in<00:01:32.069> the

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
28 days she measured ketones in the

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:35.809 
28 days she measured ketones in the
morning<00:01:32.729> fasted<00:01:33.689> on<00:01:33.810> an<00:01:33.960> empty<00:01:34.200> stomach<00:01:34.819> of

morning fasted on an empty stomach of

00:01:35.819 --> 00:01:37.639 
morning fasted on an empty stomach of
course<00:01:36.179> she<00:01:36.450> had<00:01:36.600> the<00:01:36.749> lower<00:01:36.899> level<00:01:37.229> ketones

00:01:37.639 --> 00:01:37.649 
course she had the lower level ketones

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:40.849 
course she had the lower level ketones
in<00:01:37.950> the<00:01:38.429> beginning<00:01:38.909> but<00:01:39.509> at<00:01:39.630> the<00:01:39.780> end<00:01:40.020> of<00:01:40.259> 28

00:01:40.849 --> 00:01:40.859 
in the beginning but at the end of 28

00:01:40.859 --> 00:01:45.590 
in the beginning but at the end of 28
days<00:01:41.299> 28<00:01:42.329> she<00:01:43.049> went<00:01:43.229> from<00:01:43.789> 0.5<00:01:44.789> or<00:01:44.999> even<00:01:45.479> below

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
days 28 she went from 0.5 or even below

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:50.240 
days 28 she went from 0.5 or even below
that<00:01:47.389> 0.223<00:01:48.389> point<00:01:49.259> out

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
that 0.223 point out

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.520 
that 0.223 point out
this<00:01:50.370> is<00:01:50.520> 28th<00:01:51.030> day<00:01:51.210> sometimes<00:01:51.690> people<00:01:52.050> take<00:01:52.260> a

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
this is 28th day sometimes people take a

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.660 
this is 28th day sometimes people take a
whole<00:01:53.240> whopping<00:01:54.240> in<00:01:54.960> the<00:01:55.170> little<00:01:55.440> off<00:01:55.670> it

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
whole whopping in the little off it

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.640 
whole whopping in the little off it
might<00:01:56.850> take<00:01:57.030> them<00:01:57.150> three<00:01:57.660> months<00:01:58.110> to<00:01:58.290> register

00:01:58.640 --> 00:01:58.650 
might take them three months to register

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:00.410 
might take them three months to register
those<00:01:58.800> numbers<00:01:59.160> the<00:01:59.400> problem<00:01:59.880> is<00:02:00.000> is<00:02:00.270> that

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
those numbers the problem is is that

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.040 
those numbers the problem is is that
people<00:02:00.630> become<00:02:01.140> so<00:02:01.920> damn<00:02:02.280> and<00:02:02.520> patient<00:02:03.060> to<00:02:03.870> hit

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:04.050 
people become so damn and patient to hit

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:07.130 
people become so damn and patient to hit
the<00:02:04.140> higher<00:02:04.320> number<00:02:05.060> millimoles<00:02:06.060> and<00:02:06.420> even

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
the higher number millimoles and even

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.320 
the higher number millimoles and even
listen<00:02:07.560> if<00:02:07.830> you<00:02:08.040> even<00:02:08.429> if<00:02:08.700> you<00:02:08.880> hit<00:02:09.119> those

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
listen if you even if you hit those
