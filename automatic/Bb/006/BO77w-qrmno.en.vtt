00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:21.940 
didn't because they are paying 15,000
either<00:02:19.780> okay<00:02:20.780> it's<00:02:21.260> because<00:02:21.560> they<00:02:21.710> want<00:02:21.740> to

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:21.950 
either okay it's because they want to

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:25.620 
either okay it's because they want to
pay<00:02:22.100> less<00:02:22.340> than<00:02:22.370> five<00:02:22.820> you<00:02:23.720> know<00:02:23.870> and<00:02:24.650> I'll<00:02:25.010> and

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:28.910 
so the economics of it have gotten us in

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:32.920 
so the economics of it have gotten us in
these<00:02:29.180> little<00:02:29.450> rooms<00:02:29.660> and<00:02:30.440> and<00:02:30.830> I<00:02:31.840> very<00:02:32.840> much
