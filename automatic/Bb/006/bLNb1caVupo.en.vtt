doing<00:01:40.380> projects<00:01:40.890> I<00:01:41.040> have<00:01:41.579> no<00:01:41.729> idea<00:01:42.060> what

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
doing projects I have no idea what

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.139 
doing projects I have no idea what
situations<00:01:43.229> we<00:01:43.290> have<00:01:43.320> going<00:01:43.590> on<00:01:43.680> in<00:01:43.829> your<00:01:43.979> home

00:01:44.139 --> 00:01:44.149 
situations we have going on in your home

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:46.190 
situations we have going on in your home
so<00:01:45.149> there's<00:01:45.360> no<00:01:45.509> way<00:01:45.659> that<00:01:45.689> we<00:01:45.960> can<00:01:46.079> be

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
so there's no way that we can be

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.319 
so there's no way that we can be
responsible<00:01:46.799> for<00:01:46.950> being<00:01:47.640> the<00:01:47.759> same<00:01:47.939> I<00:01:48.119> want<00:01:48.210> to

responsible for being the same I want to
show<00:01:48.479> you<00:01:48.540> an<00:01:48.689> idea<00:01:48.750> you<00:01:49.500> can<00:01:49.530> use<00:01:49.770> that<00:01:49.890> idea

show you an idea you can use that idea

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:55.460 
show you an idea you can use that idea

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
doing in order to get rid of some water

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:03.530 
doing in order to get rid of some water
standing<00:01:59.310> water<00:01:59.490> on<00:01:59.610> my<00:01:59.850> yard<00:02:01.579> alright<00:02:02.610> my

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
standing water on my yard alright my

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:04.850 
standing water on my yard alright my
situation<00:02:04.020> is<00:02:04.079> I<00:02:04.170> have<00:02:04.200> an<00:02:04.320> air<00:02:04.469> conditioner

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
situation is I have an air conditioner

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.219 
situation is I have an air conditioner
unit<00:02:05.130> yet<00:02:05.759> drains<00:02:06.329> in<00:02:06.450> a<00:02:06.509> summer<00:02:06.719> quite<00:02:06.930> a<00:02:06.960> bit

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
unit yet drains in a summer quite a bit

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:08.690 
unit yet drains in a summer quite a bit
and<00:02:07.439> so<00:02:07.649> what<00:02:07.799> it<00:02:07.890> does<00:02:07.920> is<00:02:08.190> this<00:02:08.310> is<00:02:08.369> a<00:02:08.489> fairly

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
and so what it does is this is a fairly

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.910 
and so what it does is this is a fairly
flat<00:02:09.030> yard<00:02:09.330> and<00:02:09.869> the<00:02:10.229> water<00:02:10.440> comes<00:02:10.649> over<00:02:10.830> my

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
flat yard and the water comes over my

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.040 
flat yard and the water comes over my
grass<00:02:11.129> and<00:02:11.400> it<00:02:11.489> keeps<00:02:11.640> us<00:02:11.819> just<00:02:12.030> too<00:02:12.180> wet<00:02:12.420> so<00:02:12.660> to

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
grass and it keeps us just too wet so to

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.820 
grass and it keeps us just too wet so to
resolve<00:02:13.379> that<00:02:13.500> is

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
resolve that is

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.260 
resolve that is
and<00:02:14.100> this<00:02:14.310> is<00:02:14.430> the<00:02:14.490> same<00:02:14.700> thing<00:02:14.850> you<00:02:15.000> can<00:02:15.120> use

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.270 
and this is the same thing you can use

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:16.700 
and this is the same thing you can use
around<00:02:15.420> your<00:02:15.660> porch<00:02:15.900> if<00:02:16.050> you<00:02:16.140> have<00:02:16.230> a<00:02:16.290> similar

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:16.710 
around your porch if you have a similar

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:19.130 
around your porch if you have a similar
situation<00:02:16.920> with<00:02:17.460> it<00:02:17.670> with<00:02:17.880> a<00:02:17.910> downspout<00:02:18.270> used

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
situation with it with a downspout used

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.260 
situation with it with a downspout used
to<00:02:19.260> create<00:02:19.560> somewhat<00:02:20.070> of<00:02:20.100> a<00:02:20.280> French<00:02:21.000> drain

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:21.270 
to create somewhat of a French drain

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:22.970 
to create somewhat of a French drain
system<00:02:21.720> and<00:02:21.870> what<00:02:21.990> that<00:02:22.020> is<00:02:22.320> is<00:02:22.530> I'm<00:02:22.620> digging<00:02:22.890> a

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
system and what that is is I'm digging a

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:25.640 
system and what that is is I'm digging a
hole<00:02:23.240> and<00:02:24.240> I'm<00:02:24.360> a<00:02:24.480> kind<00:02:24.990> of<00:02:25.020> a<00:02:25.110> drainage<00:02:25.410> ditch

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
hole and I'm a kind of a drainage ditch

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:27.680 
hole and I'm a kind of a drainage ditch
and<00:02:25.890> I'm<00:02:26.430> going<00:02:26.670> to<00:02:26.790> dig<00:02:27.120> this<00:02:27.240> fairly<00:02:27.450> deep

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
and I'm going to dig this fairly deep

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:29.780 
and I'm going to dig this fairly deep
and<00:02:27.870> then<00:02:28.020> I'm<00:02:28.140> going<00:02:28.260> to<00:02:28.350> fill<00:02:28.530> it<00:02:28.790> almost

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
and then I'm going to fill it almost

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:31.460 
and then I'm going to fill it almost
three-quarters<00:02:30.240> the<00:02:30.270> way<00:02:30.390> up<00:02:30.720> with<00:02:30.960> with

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
three-quarters the way up with with

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:33.530 
three-quarters the way up with with
stone<00:02:31.740> and<00:02:32.040> then<00:02:32.550> over<00:02:32.760> top<00:02:32.940> of<00:02:32.970> that<00:02:33.180> I'll<00:02:33.390> put

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
stone and then over top of that I'll put

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.840 
stone and then over top of that I'll put
dirt<00:02:33.750> and<00:02:34.020> put<00:02:34.110> the<00:02:34.230> grass<00:02:34.410> back<00:02:34.620> in<00:02:34.890> and<00:02:35.130> I'll

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:35.850 
dirt and put the grass back in and I'll

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:37.640 
dirt and put the grass back in and I'll
have<00:02:36.000> the<00:02:36.120> pipe<00:02:36.300> run<00:02:36.510> into<00:02:36.960> that<00:02:37.080> ditch<00:02:37.380> and

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
have the pipe run into that ditch and

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:40.190 
have the pipe run into that ditch and
the<00:02:38.070> water<00:02:38.280> will<00:02:38.490> run<00:02:38.670> into<00:02:39.450> the<00:02:39.480> stone<00:02:39.840> the

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
the water will run into the stone the

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:41.720 
the water will run into the stone the
stone<00:02:40.260> will<00:02:40.620> filtrate<00:02:41.010> it<00:02:41.100> down<00:02:41.220> the<00:02:41.430> bottom

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
stone will filtrate it down the bottom

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:44.180 
stone will filtrate it down the bottom
of<00:02:41.850> it<00:02:42.000> where<00:02:42.600> we'll<00:02:42.840> have<00:02:42.930> time<00:02:43.230> to<00:02:43.470> end<00:02:43.950> to

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.190 
of it where we'll have time to end to

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:46.580 
of it where we'll have time to end to
soak<00:02:44.700> into<00:02:44.910> the<00:02:45.000> surrounding<00:02:45.570> soil<00:02:45.600> and<00:02:46.110> not

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
soak into the surrounding soil and not

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:48.680 
soak into the surrounding soil and not
above<00:02:46.860> my<00:02:47.070> soil<00:02:47.280> so<00:02:47.850> if<00:02:47.970> you<00:02:48.090> have<00:02:48.210> a<00:02:48.240> similar

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
above my soil so if you have a similar

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:50.210 
above my soil so if you have a similar
type<00:02:48.900> situation<00:02:49.470> this<00:02:49.620> might<00:02:49.800> be<00:02:50.010> ideal

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
type situation this might be ideal

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.640 
type situation this might be ideal
especially<00:02:51.150> since<00:02:51.510> I<00:02:51.600> can't<00:02:51.840> run<00:02:52.050> a<00:02:52.080> big<00:02:52.440> black

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
especially since I can't run a big black

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:54.920 
especially since I can't run a big black
pipe<00:02:52.980> out<00:02:53.190> out<00:02:53.400> there<00:02:53.730> I<00:02:53.760> just<00:02:54.150> that<00:02:54.600> won't<00:02:54.810> be

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
pipe out out there I just that won't be

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:57.710 
pipe out out there I just that won't be
feasible<00:02:55.320> for<00:02:55.500> my<00:02:55.650> yard<00:02:55.920> so<00:02:56.580> continue<00:02:57.480> and

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
feasible for my yard so continue and

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:59.840 
feasible for my yard so continue and
show<00:02:57.900> you<00:02:57.960> as<00:02:58.110> we<00:02:58.170> go<00:02:58.230> along<00:02:58.340> the<00:02:59.340> progress<00:02:59.700> I'm

00:02:59.840 --> 00:02:59.850 
show you as we go along the progress I'm

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:03.890 
show you as we go along the progress I'm
making<00:03:01.520> all<00:03:02.520> right<00:03:02.700> so<00:03:03.000> after<00:03:03.330> a<00:03:03.360> little<00:03:03.720> bit

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
making all right so after a little bit

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:06.170 
making all right so after a little bit
of<00:03:03.990> time<00:03:04.170> we<00:03:04.350> finally<00:03:04.830> have<00:03:05.040> our<00:03:05.250> our<00:03:05.640> trench

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180 
of time we finally have our our trench

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:08.390 
of time we finally have our our trench
dug<00:03:06.390> and<00:03:06.750> I<00:03:07.110> made<00:03:07.290> a<00:03:07.320> sump<00:03:07.620> at<00:03:07.740> the<00:03:07.860> bottom<00:03:08.220> of

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
dug and I made a sump at the bottom of

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.250 
dug and I made a sump at the bottom of
it<00:03:08.520> in<00:03:09.180> the<00:03:09.330> sump<00:03:09.600> is<00:03:09.720> to<00:03:09.870> collect<00:03:10.080> the<00:03:10.230> water

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260 
it in the sump is to collect the water

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:15.430 
it in the sump is to collect the water
as<00:03:10.770> it<00:03:10.920> comes<00:03:11.130> off<00:03:11.310> the<00:03:14.000> downspout<00:03:15.000> of<00:03:15.150> the

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510 
pipe of the furrow air conditioner unit

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:20.479 
pipe of the furrow air conditioner unit
and<00:03:18.660> that<00:03:18.690> flows<00:03:18.959> into<00:03:19.230> my<00:03:19.380> stone<00:03:19.739> it<00:03:20.400> will

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:20.489 
and that flows into my stone it will

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:21.830 
and that flows into my stone it will
flow<00:03:20.670> all<00:03:20.700> the<00:03:20.820> way<00:03:20.940> down<00:03:21.120> on<00:03:21.270> my<00:03:21.360> sump<00:03:21.630> and

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
flow all the way down on my sump and

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:27.410 
flow all the way down on my sump and
it'll<00:03:22.050> dump<00:03:22.770> area<00:03:24.830> slowly<00:03:26.060> into<00:03:27.060> the<00:03:27.090> ground

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:27.420 
it'll dump area slowly into the ground

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:29.449 
it'll dump area slowly into the ground
so<00:03:27.810> that<00:03:27.840> this<00:03:28.230> area<00:03:28.500> will<00:03:28.650> stay<00:03:28.860> a<00:03:28.890> lot<00:03:29.250> more

the<00:04:43.580> the<00:04:44.580> drain<00:04:44.820> over<00:04:45.300> here<00:04:45.600> on<00:04:45.780> the

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:46.220 
the the drain over here on the

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:48.470 
the the drain over here on the
air-conditioner<00:04:47.220> unit<00:04:47.400> and<00:04:47.730> extend<00:04:48.300> that<00:04:48.420> out

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:48.480 
air-conditioner unit and extend that out

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:50.990 
air-conditioner unit and extend that out
and<00:04:48.900> stick<00:04:49.860> it<00:04:49.950> down<00:04:50.040> into<00:04:50.280> the<00:04:50.460> end<00:04:50.790> of<00:04:50.940> the

gravel and so the water will run through

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:55.310 
gravel and so the water will run through
that<00:04:53.490> gravel<00:04:53.910> down<00:04:54.060> to<00:04:54.210> the<00:04:54.360> sump<00:04:54.630> where<00:04:55.200> it
