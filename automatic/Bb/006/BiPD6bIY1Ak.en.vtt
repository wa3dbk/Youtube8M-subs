00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.430 
will be an arched window so that's why I

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:34.250 
will be an arched window so that's why I
didn't<00:03:32.730> do<00:03:33.150> anything<00:03:33.359> with<00:03:33.570> the<00:03:33.630> top<00:03:33.870> of<00:03:34.079> it

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:21.520 
they're a little bit high up it's
because<00:04:19.609> there's<00:04:20.090> going<00:04:20.389> to<00:04:20.509> be<00:04:20.630> a<00:04:20.750> porch<00:04:21.109> here

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:21.530 
because there's going to be a porch here

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:24.640 
because there's going to be a porch here
so<00:04:21.979> the<00:04:22.250> porch<00:04:22.520> will<00:04:22.669> start<00:04:23.030> right<00:04:24.020> here<00:04:24.440> and

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:24.650 
so the porch will start right here and

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:26.499 
so the porch will start right here and
then<00:04:25.009> it'll<00:04:25.250> probably<00:04:25.520> end<00:04:25.669> right<00:04:25.970> about<00:04:26.000> here

00:04:26.499 --> 00:04:26.509 
then it'll probably end right about here

00:04:26.509 --> 00:04:28.480 
then it'll probably end right about here
just<00:04:26.690> below<00:04:27.530> the<00:04:27.680> windows<00:04:28.009> I<00:04:28.130> had<00:04:28.280> it<00:04:28.400> all

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:28.490 
just below the windows I had it all

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:29.980 
just below the windows I had it all
planned<00:04:28.520> out<00:04:28.970> so<00:04:29.210> I<00:04:29.270> knew<00:04:29.419> how<00:04:29.570> high<00:04:29.720> to<00:04:29.780> make

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:29.990 
planned out so I knew how high to make

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:34.689 
planned out so I knew how high to make
the<00:04:30.139> windows<00:04:31.210> to<00:04:32.210> look<00:04:32.360> right<00:04:32.539> there<00:04:32.900> I<00:04:33.520> like<00:04:34.520> I

00:04:34.689 --> 00:04:34.699 
the windows to look right there I like I

00:04:34.699 --> 00:04:39.279 
the windows to look right there I like I
figured<00:04:35.330> out<00:04:35.449> the<00:04:35.660> height<00:04:35.840> of<00:04:36.020> it<00:04:36.169> so<00:04:38.289> that's

00:04:39.279 --> 00:04:39.289 
figured out the height of it so that's

00:04:39.289 --> 00:04:41.499 
figured out the height of it so that's
that<00:04:39.470> bedroom<00:04:39.830> there<00:04:40.070> I<00:04:40.310> have<00:04:41.120> these<00:04:41.270> wires

00:04:41.499 --> 00:04:41.509 
that bedroom there I have these wires

00:04:41.509 --> 00:04:43.629 
that bedroom there I have these wires
coming<00:04:41.870> up<00:04:42.110> they'll<00:04:42.919> come<00:04:43.130> up<00:04:43.160> right<00:04:43.460> through

00:04:43.629 --> 00:04:43.639 
coming up they'll come up right through

00:04:43.639 --> 00:04:48.430 
coming up they'll come up right through
the<00:04:43.729> wall<00:04:43.910> and<00:04:45.910> my<00:04:46.910> battery's<00:04:47.270> going<00:04:47.479> and<00:04:47.810> then

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:48.440 
the wall and my battery's going and then

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:50.830 
the wall and my battery's going and then
this<00:04:48.620> window<00:04:48.860> is<00:04:49.400> similar<00:04:49.910> to<00:04:50.240> the<00:04:50.360> bottom<00:04:50.509> one
