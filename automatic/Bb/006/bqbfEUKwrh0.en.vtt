00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
markings under leg so as I said this is

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.280

one<00:01:20.460> of<00:01:20.580> my<00:01:20.640> favorite<00:01:21.150> molds<00:01:21.450> of<00:01:21.690> optimists<00:01:22.200> in

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
one of my favorite molds of optimists in

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.490 
one of my favorite molds of optimists in
the<00:01:22.380> last<00:01:22.590> 10<00:01:22.920> years<00:01:23.100> or<00:01:23.310> so<00:01:23.930> not<00:01:24.930> a<00:01:24.960> big<00:01:25.200> fan<00:01:25.440> of

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
the last 10 years or so not a big fan of

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.130 
the last 10 years or so not a big fan of
his<00:01:25.950> beast<00:01:26.280> modes<00:01:26.610> or<00:01:26.850> our<00:01:27.480> mod<00:01:27.780> and<00:01:27.960> things

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
his beast modes or our mod and things

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.740 
his beast modes or our mod and things
like<00:01:28.290> that<00:01:28.350> so<00:01:29.480> transformations<00:01:30.480> very

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
like that so transformations very

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.360 
like that so transformations very
similar<00:01:31.110> we<00:01:31.170> have<00:01:31.260> to<00:01:31.350> take<00:01:31.530> off<00:01:31.710> the<00:01:31.920> top<00:01:32.070> wind

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:32.370 
similar we have to take off the top wind

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:34.880 
similar we have to take off the top wind
vane<00:01:32.580> and<00:01:32.850> you<00:01:33.360> have<00:01:33.510> to<00:01:33.630> take<00:01:33.810> off<00:01:34.020> the<00:01:34.620> smoke

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
vane and you have to take off the smoke

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.720 
vane and you have to take off the smoke
stocks<00:01:35.190> which<00:01:35.490> become<00:01:36.390> the<00:01:36.420> gun<00:01:37.220> by<00:01:38.220> folding

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:38.730 
stocks which become the gun by folding

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:44.330 
stocks which become the gun by folding
it<00:01:39.320> together<00:01:40.320> like<00:01:40.560> that<00:01:42.980> and<00:01:43.980> this<00:01:44.130> one<00:01:44.310> also

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
it together like that and this one also

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.980 
it together like that and this one also
becomes<00:01:44.909> a<00:01:45.030> gun<00:01:45.210> by<00:01:45.990> splitting<00:01:46.470> it<00:01:47.840> folding<00:01:48.840> it

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
becomes a gun by splitting it folding it

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:54.140 
becomes a gun by splitting it folding it
and<00:01:49.340> then<00:01:50.340> popping<00:01:50.790> out<00:01:51.710> so<00:01:52.760> put<00:01:53.760> those<00:01:53.880> aside

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:54.150 
and then popping out so put those aside

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:57.460 
and then popping out so put those aside
for<00:01:54.390> now<00:01:54.860> transformation<00:01:55.860> is<00:01:56.070> pretty<00:01:56.460> cool

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:57.470 
for now transformation is pretty cool

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:00.020 
for now transformation is pretty cool
you<00:01:58.470> can<00:01:58.650> get<00:01:58.800> a<00:01:58.830> little<00:01:58.979> tied<00:01:59.370> up<00:01:59.400> in<00:01:59.670> here<00:01:59.940> if

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
you can get a little tied up in here if

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.539 
you can get a little tied up in here if
you're<00:02:00.150> not<00:02:00.180> careful<00:02:00.479> but<00:02:01.110> all<00:02:01.140> in<00:02:01.409> all<00:02:01.530> I<00:02:01.799> like

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
you're not careful but all in all I like

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:04.430 
you're not careful but all in all I like
this<00:02:02.670> transformation<00:02:03.330> is<00:02:03.360> pretty<00:02:03.690> smooth<00:02:03.930> the

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:04.440 
this transformation is pretty smooth the

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:08.149 
this transformation is pretty smooth the
vehicle<00:02:04.770> modes<00:02:05.280> role<00:02:05.700> as<00:02:05.820> well<00:02:06.030> and<00:02:07.129> you<00:02:08.129> can

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:08.159 
vehicle modes role as well and you can

00:02:08.159 --> 00:02:10.039 
vehicle modes role as well and you can
get<00:02:08.369> transformation<00:02:09.000> pretty<00:02:09.299> easy<00:02:09.479> so<00:02:09.750> first

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:10.049 
get transformation pretty easy so first

00:02:10.049 --> 00:02:12.050 
get transformation pretty easy so first
thing<00:02:10.170> you<00:02:10.259> want<00:02:10.379> to<00:02:10.409> do<00:02:10.530> pop<00:02:11.069> up<00:02:11.280> side<00:02:11.580> panels

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
thing you want to do pop up side panels

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.440 
thing you want to do pop up side panels
on<00:02:12.240> both<00:02:12.450> sides<00:02:12.750> okay

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450 
on both sides okay

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:16.690 
on both sides okay
and<00:02:14.750> then<00:02:14.959> it<00:02:15.050> gets<00:02:15.200> a<00:02:15.500> little<00:02:15.709> tricky<00:02:16.069> here<00:02:16.370> so

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:16.700 
and then it gets a little tricky here so

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:19.390 
and then it gets a little tricky here so
you<00:02:16.790> want<00:02:16.970> to<00:02:17.030> kind<00:02:17.150> of<00:02:17.270> wiggle<00:02:18.099> the<00:02:19.099> front

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
you want to kind of wiggle the front

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.900 
you want to kind of wiggle the front
section<00:02:19.879> open<00:02:20.269> on<00:02:20.420> both<00:02:20.540> sides<00:02:20.870> like<00:02:21.140> this<00:02:21.170> and

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:21.910 
section open on both sides like this and

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:24.970 
section open on both sides like this and

so we can get everything else in frame
here<00:03:21.530> and<00:03:21.670> finish<00:03:22.670> transformation<00:03:23.450> is

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:23.690 
here and finish transformation is

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:25.870
