00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:07.870
 Arguing Creators Have European Trainers 

00:00:08.679 --> 00:00:12.530
 This was the objective of the lectures held during the Bahian team. 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:13.729
 It's like this in Germany. 

00:00:13.729 --> 00:00:18.109
 more than 30 people participated in the practical and theoretical classes 

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:23.159
 the referee of the MM Thiago Rezende decision showed the participants the differences 

00:00:23.159 --> 00:00:25.669
 between the gears part damaged 

00:00:25.669 --> 00:00:28.669
 Another issue addressed was the criteria for judgment 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:52.250
 she found all the time people arriving was getting small space ball seven 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:57.360
 braga was in the theoretical class much participation of the European students 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:02.550
 at 12 o'clock wÃ¡lter -president of the international association of horses 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.950
 was one of the most interested 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:08.820
 borges and victor 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.970
 10 the pulse during the team is also morning signalman gathered more than 30 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:14.710
 students 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:19.440
 responsibility for qualifying this class on the other side of the Atlantic 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:23.230
 on behalf of the arbitrator of the decision issued 

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:27.290
 with content on the tip of the tongue it was not difficult to speak of the horse without 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:28.270
 borders 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:31.220
 even in English 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:33.410
 to form 

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:37.470
 the course presented the Germans details on the progress of mangalarga 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:38.420
 walker 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:42.990
 what is sought when the subject is the march to there who judges horses in 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.480
 the presence of Brazilians in Germany was very important. 

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:51.640
 since the Europeans want to judge them but the 2 in the competitions following the 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:54.670
 Brazil standards and people counts mangalarga marchador 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.580
 photos and videos of livestock from different regions of the 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:00.319
 parents 

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:05.380
 randomly selected by a team of dccv mm were presented in the 

00:02:05.379 --> 00:02:06.270
 lecture 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.840
 remembers alternating having been to know the race at the beginning of the report he says 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:14.459
 that classes during the fair was fundamental for him to better understand the 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:17.589
 differences between the beat marches and that each 

00:02:17.589 --> 00:02:21.709
 it is important for those who have the first contacts with the ration was the last of the 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:25.239
 marchers before they were shared and that the idea is that it is their 

00:02:28.289 --> 00:02:30.659
 contact with the breed and the horse 

00:02:30.659 --> 00:02:34.660
 that's what happened is not a long-awaited practice for the Germans 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:36.959
 and accompanied by a large public 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:41.349
 in the presentation lane the students rode was felt in the reins throughout the 

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:42.360
 docility 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:47.180
 in comfort but to 2 some made it a point to talk about the race 

00:02:49.089 --> 00:02:50.789
 we show the area 

00:02:50.789 --> 00:02:52.359
 the methodology of judgment 

00:02:52.359 --> 00:02:53.919
 is point to point 

00:02:53.919 --> 00:02:57.489
 however the animals in the head of the young animals may have more will 

00:02:58.609 --> 00:03:03.839
 - we highlight the criteria of the urgency of walking there is the comfort 

00:03:03.839 --> 00:03:04.629
 style 

00:03:04.629 --> 00:03:07.810
 the dressage feeling irregularity 

00:03:08.379 --> 00:03:11.379
 it's point the enduro is each of these requirements 

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:17.079
 rubinho we show to be the difference between the two types of low but the beat is 

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:18.109
 more delicate 

00:03:18.109 --> 00:03:21.289
 and here in Europe I believe they have 

00:03:21.289 --> 00:03:24.009
 there is room for all two types of mass 

00:03:24.009 --> 00:03:27.969
 This is the first official course organized by the 

00:03:27.969 --> 00:03:29.510
 referees and coaches 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:30.929
 here in europe 

00:03:30.929 --> 00:03:35.439
 The main objective is to show the differences between the 

00:03:35.439 --> 00:03:40.489
 and to the judgment methodology used in the mangalarga walker breed 

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:44.139
 Maybe today is their great difficulty here. 

00:03:44.139 --> 00:03:47.029
 is to differentiate gear motors 

00:03:47.029 --> 00:03:52.119
 and all who have assembled have been able to see the faithful to comfort in her there are communities 

00:03:52.669 --> 00:03:53.699
 It's evident 

00:03:53.699 --> 00:03:55.629
 different from mariah state 

00:03:55.629 --> 00:03:59.989
 is one of the main features this amenity concealed prove here 

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:04.529
 this quality of the mute our race bush like this is fundamental and important 

00:04:04.529 --> 00:04:08.469
 for future exhibitions and quality here in europe 

00:04:08.469 --> 00:04:10.149
 developed 

00:04:10.149 --> 00:04:11.539
 we know he 

00:04:11.539 --> 00:04:12.869
 the European people 

00:04:12.869 --> 00:04:14.379
 and has a culture that knows 

00:04:14.379 --> 00:04:15.509
 huge 

00:04:15.509 --> 00:04:16.599
 such 

00:04:16.599 --> 00:04:21.650
 the marker for the ninth place where horse market has foment have 

00:04:21.649 --> 00:04:22.720
 interest 

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:23.830
 on horses 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:25.080
 in one of them the pain 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:27.749
 I think it's a matter of time, not even for him in Europe. 

00:04:27.749 --> 00:04:29.400
 the vehicle of the victim 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:31.789
 when we had here in europe 

00:04:31.789 --> 00:04:35.869
 It was a big name for animals with certainty official events going to be 

00:04:35.869 --> 00:04:38.620
 performed 

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:42.749
 for the European association the course during the Texas team was a success 

00:04:42.749 --> 00:04:46.489
 Assis said that European referees and coaches need a 

00:04:46.489 --> 00:04:48.500
 understand the movements better 

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:52.629
 especially the beat-up in teresina already beaten to be 

00:04:52.629 --> 00:04:57.379
 of these seven artists the red carpet identify details one of the directors of the 

00:04:57.379 --> 00:05:01.219
 European association of being a decision in me by the realization of the 

00:05:01.219 --> 00:05:04.020
 and remember that classes only happened 

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:08.620
 because the Brazilian breeders make the animals available to the fair 

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:12.820
 he says he knows the race better now and has a lot of fun with the marchers 

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:14.559
 here in europe 

00:05:14.559 --> 00:05:15.650
 before they were 

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:16.770
 she was 

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:21.380
 the chairman of the abcc mm more than xaxim developed along with the board 

00:05:21.379 --> 00:05:26.320
 Brazilian and European project to qualify the professionals and followed 

00:05:26.319 --> 00:05:29.650
 the course of loom in the demo course with creators in 

00:05:30.499 --> 00:05:34.190
 last year in Holland at a meeting of the creators 

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:36.319
 the profit genus just stopped 

00:05:36.319 --> 00:05:40.529
 music habits that help the marching horse and the coaches of 

00:05:40.529 --> 00:05:42.439
 training centers 

00:05:42.439 --> 00:05:45.259
 about the behavior of his judgment he committed 

00:05:45.259 --> 00:05:49.239
 play ended audi but what to eat but the beat the comparison of the two 

00:05:49.849 --> 00:05:54.050
 and there spending millions in the week that ended with 25 horses that came here 

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:55.439
 from Brazil in December 

00:05:55.439 --> 00:05:57.819
 we are demonstrating here 

00:05:57.819 --> 00:06:01.979
 we see many and the very great to know the in the saints the concentration 

00:06:01.979 --> 00:06:03.749
 was criticized for several days
