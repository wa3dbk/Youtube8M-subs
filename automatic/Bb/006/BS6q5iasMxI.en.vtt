bit<00:00:37.739> okay<00:00:47.540> basically<00:00:48.540> our<00:00:48.690> idea<00:00:48.720> we're<00:00:49.409> going

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
bit okay basically our idea we're going

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.829 
bit okay basically our idea we're going
to<00:00:49.589> do<00:00:49.739> part<00:00:50.640> of<00:00:50.729> our<00:00:50.850> fast<00:00:51.089> break<00:00:51.390> movement

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:51.839 
to do part of our fast break movement

00:00:51.839 --> 00:00:54.560 
to do part of our fast break movement
our<00:00:52.470> early<00:00:52.769> transition<00:00:53.190> then<00:00:54.120> we<00:00:54.210> get<00:00:54.390> into

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
our early transition then we get into

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.259 
our early transition then we get into
each<00:00:55.170> of<00:00:55.350> the<00:00:55.409> layers<00:00:55.620> in<00:00:56.190> order<00:00:56.580> and<00:00:56.970> so<00:00:57.180> if

00:00:57.259 --> 00:00:57.269 
each of the layers in order and so if

00:00:57.269 --> 00:00:58.490 
each of the layers in order and so if
you<00:00:57.360> have<00:00:57.449> the<00:00:57.510> handout<00:00:57.839> from<00:00:57.900> yesterday<00:00:58.350> it's

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
you have the handout from yesterday it's

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.140 
you have the handout from yesterday it's
here<00:00:58.710> we're<00:00:59.190> gonna<00:00:59.280> call<00:00:59.610> up<00:00:59.640> the<00:00:59.940> layers

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:00.150 
here we're gonna call up the layers

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:07.670 
here we're gonna call up the layers
forum<00:01:05.210> we<00:01:06.210> go<00:01:06.360> to<00:01:06.630> trips<00:01:06.990> of<00:01:07.170> just<00:01:07.440> straight

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
forum we go to trips of just straight

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.160 
forum we go to trips of just straight
fast-break<00:01:08.340> 500<00:01:08.850> and<00:01:09.390> then<00:01:09.600> we<00:01:09.720> add<00:01:09.869> one

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
fast-break 500 and then we add one

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.170 
fast-break 500 and then we add one
defender<00:01:10.650> each<00:01:10.770> of<00:01:10.920> the<00:01:11.010> last<00:01:11.190> five<00:01:11.400> trips<00:01:11.760> so

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
defender each of the last five trips so

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.789 
defender each of the last five trips so
it'll<00:01:12.360> be<00:01:12.450> five<00:01:12.630> on<00:01:12.780> one<00:01:12.960> five<00:01:13.200> two<00:01:13.470> five<00:01:13.650> on

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
it'll be five on one five two five on

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:14.870 
it'll be five on one five two five on
three<00:01:13.950> we're<00:01:14.220> doing<00:01:14.400> different<00:01:14.700> layers

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
three we're doing different layers

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.270 
three we're doing different layers
against<00:01:15.210> those<00:01:15.390> what<00:01:16.380> we<00:01:16.470> tell<00:01:16.710> the<00:01:16.830> defense

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
against those what we tell the defense

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:18.920 
against those what we tell the defense
is<00:01:17.580> you<00:01:17.790> just<00:01:17.940> pick<00:01:18.150> a<00:01:18.180> player<00:01:18.479> and<00:01:18.659> you<00:01:18.690> guard

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
is you just pick a player and you guard

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.990 
is you just pick a player and you guard
that<00:01:19.080> player<00:01:19.320> so<00:01:20.009> we're<00:01:20.159> not<00:01:20.250> going<00:01:20.549> up<00:01:20.759> in<00:01:20.909> the

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
that player so we're not going up in the

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.399 
that player so we're not going up in the
middle<00:01:21.270> they're<00:01:21.450> actually<00:01:21.719> taking<00:01:21.869> away<00:01:22.109> one

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
middle they're actually taking away one

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.109 
middle they're actually taking away one
option<00:01:22.799> taking<00:01:23.100> away<00:01:23.219> one<00:01:23.399> player<00:01:23.670> and<00:01:23.939> we

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
option taking away one player and we

00:01:24.119 --> 00:02:54.170 
option taking away one player and we
build<00:01:24.329> it<00:01:24.450> uptown<00:01:24.689> so<00:01:25.229> let's<00:01:25.649> see<00:01:25.740> how<00:01:25.829> we<00:01:25.890> do

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:56.729 

we<00:02:55.180> try<00:02:55.359> to<00:02:55.389> add<00:02:55.599> the<00:02:55.750> defense<00:02:56.139> just<00:02:56.260> so<00:02:56.590> that

00:02:56.729 --> 00:02:56.739 
we try to add the defense just so that

00:02:56.739 --> 00:02:58.770 
we try to add the defense just so that
they<00:02:56.829> can<00:02:57.010> see<00:02:57.220> what<00:02:57.459> layers<00:02:58.060> are<00:02:58.299> there<00:02:58.419> hell

00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:58.780 
they can see what layers are there hell

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:00.360 
they can see what layers are there hell
is<00:02:58.870> rusty<00:02:59.260> I<00:02:59.290> mean<00:02:59.470> we<00:02:59.560> like<00:02:59.829> I<00:02:59.919> said<00:03:00.099> we<00:03:00.189> did<00:03:00.340> it

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:02.680 
every day and I got to the point where

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:05.250 
every day and I got to the point where
they<00:03:02.799> knew<00:03:03.099> if<00:03:03.669> it's<00:03:03.819> by<00:03:04.000> my<00:03:04.180> three<00:03:04.510> I<00:03:04.569> know<00:03:04.750> all

right<00:03:05.290> I'm<00:03:05.530> doing<00:03:05.680> the<00:03:06.430> dribble<00:03:06.909> post<00:03:07.450> passing

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:07.870 
right I'm doing the dribble post passing

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:09.509 
right I'm doing the dribble post passing
cut<00:03:08.049> I<00:03:08.319> know<00:03:08.620> which<00:03:08.859> guy<00:03:09.040> I'm<00:03:09.159> going<00:03:09.280> to<00:03:09.340> throw

00:03:09.509 --> 00:03:09.519 
cut I know which guy I'm going to throw

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:10.949 
cut I know which guy I'm going to throw
it<00:03:09.609> to<00:03:09.639> her<00:03:09.819> which<00:03:09.939> wing<00:03:10.180> on<00:03:10.329> the<00:03:10.359> throw<00:03:10.629> too<00:03:10.810> so

00:03:10.949 --> 00:03:10.959 
it to her which wing on the throw too so

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:12.449 
it to her which wing on the throw too so
he'll<00:03:11.079> be<00:03:11.109> open<00:03:11.500> and<00:03:11.620> they<00:03:11.829> figure<00:03:12.099> that<00:03:12.129> stuff

00:03:12.449 --> 00:03:12.459 
he'll be open and they figure that stuff

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:15.360 
he'll be open and they figure that stuff
out<00:03:12.609> but<00:03:13.599> we<00:03:13.689> try<00:03:13.870> to<00:03:13.930> do<00:03:14.109> that<00:03:14.290> as<00:03:14.739> fast<00:03:15.040> as<00:03:15.250> we

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:15.370 
out but we try to do that as fast as we

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:17.580 
out but we try to do that as fast as we
can<00:03:15.549> we<00:03:16.419> try<00:03:16.450> to<00:03:16.629> get<00:03:16.780> into<00:03:16.959> the<00:03:17.019> layers<00:03:17.260> and

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:17.590 
can we try to get into the layers and

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:19.619 
can we try to get into the layers and
then<00:03:17.709> we<00:03:18.250> do<00:03:18.400> in<00:03:18.519> about<00:03:18.700> ten<00:03:18.969> minutes<00:03:19.000> if<00:03:19.389> we<00:03:19.480> go

00:03:19.619 --> 00:03:19.629 
then we do in about ten minutes if we go

00:03:19.629 --> 00:03:21.059 
then we do in about ten minutes if we go
two<00:03:19.930> or<00:03:20.049> three<00:03:20.260> groups<00:03:20.500> to<00:03:20.650> federate<00:03:20.859> how<00:03:20.919> many

00:03:21.059 --> 00:03:21.069 
two or three groups to federate how many

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:23.459 
two or three groups to federate how many
players<00:03:21.280> we<00:03:21.459> have<00:03:21.549> a<00:03:21.579> practice<00:03:22.090> and<00:03:22.389> it<00:03:23.230> serves

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:23.469 
players we have a practice and it serves

00:03:23.469 --> 00:03:24.809 
players we have a practice and it serves
as<00:03:23.590> a<00:03:23.650> pretty<00:03:23.859> good<00:03:23.950> warm-up<00:03:24.280> for<00:03:24.489> us<00:03:24.609> every

00:03:24.809 --> 00:03:24.819 
as a pretty good warm-up for us every

00:03:24.819 --> 00:05:02.820 
as a pretty good warm-up for us every
day

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:02.830 

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:15.839 

but<00:05:03.830> initially<00:05:04.509> they<00:05:05.509> really<00:05:05.719> get
