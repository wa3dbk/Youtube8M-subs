00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.170
 the world if we're on card 5 and we're 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:06.899
 again with a new career with their 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.250
 crystals let's think that that was 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:11.580
 a few feet that was on top of the 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:13.310
 jerry this example good well so for 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.880
 where we passed 

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:15.880
 do not 

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:23.720
 we started it started well 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:27.169
 how are we going to get to vale around here 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:29.910
 friend there was a ramp 

00:00:27.169 --> 00:00:32.040
 you have to be very careful what happens 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.989
 the first one is going to be the one who wins 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.300
 sure because it is that to fix then 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:42.530
 we are here a lot 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:47.710
 what will be the key here 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:51.940
 We are already up here, same as I bought 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:54.480
 around here like that and I play 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:54.480
 and not 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:01.400
 It's worth another pretty boy this is already 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.400
 that was not normal 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.120
 we go 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:08.260
 we go 

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:11.390
 but we have it and now it 's where 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:14.390
 you have to fall down here 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:16.130
 then it happened to me come, come, come, there is 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:19.120
 To trace that to come back has cost us 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:19.120
 quite go from there 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.530
 a mold around here other countries are 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:29.140
 fighting there are quite a few bikes here in the 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:32.190
 floor is worth 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:32.190
 I think it's around here 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:37.950
 Yes Yes Yes yes Yes 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:41.219
 and you have to get off here and you have to do 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:43.950
 this now we come now we are going to 

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:46.380
 we say is not bad after all 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:49.350
 that we have bundled there at the beginning 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:54.270
 and we got what we got 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:55.930
 and now it 's around here no no we can not 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.530
 waste more time 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:58.530
 come on 

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:02.820
 OK 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:04.290
 and another one here 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:06.650
 Look, look, we're here, we're already 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.650
 here with them 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:11.610
 do not wait, it 's like practice, there's no need 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:13.500
 jump but I think yes yes yes you have to 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:16.440
 jump you have to jump 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.850
 both since the ally at the beginning 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:20.490
 I'm not falling anymore and I'm doing 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:22.850
 everything well we could have passed 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:22.850
 before 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:32.329
 efe 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:32.329
 we need to be sixth 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:39.159
 watch out 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:40.750
 when we have and now also here 

00:02:39.159 --> 00:02:42.450
 down 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:45.490
 that is how he moves seriously I love 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:49.210
 this type of racing 

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:52.069
 - the principle that did not happen but because 

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:53.780
 the rest we are giving much the race 

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:59.180
 for topics of how to speak 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:03:01.180
 we have what we have here is worth 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:03.580
 we put fifth 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:05.440
 do not 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:07.420
 come on we have the third one here in front 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:09.760
 for one has already finished first so 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:15.550
 which career does not have to be 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:17.710
 many seconds we go fast 

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:19.630
 come on come on let's go after all the 

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:22.320
 what he has given 

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:22.320
 we go 

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:30.660
 you arrive as it does not reach you or we go to 

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:33.350
 make it calm that if it did not come out anymore 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:33.350
 OK 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:39.260
 it's worth third quarters 

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:42.020
 deep 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:47.430
 but what is here 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:52.549
 say 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:52.549
 we go that this time that's that 

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:58.390
 come on come on we have here the fourth 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:02.180
 come on let's go 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:06.349
 and now where are you here 

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:08.090
 I think that if one finishes second we can 

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:10.370
 get third 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:13.489
 wa third would be a serious pass 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:15.970
 because after which I have bundled the 

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:15.970
 beginning 

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:25.850
 let's go let's go 

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:27.320
 Amazing Amazing oysters me seriously 

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:29.870
 It has cost a lot at the beginning 

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:32.720
 pass me what has been the second part 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:34.580
 of the race but at the end May 

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:36.290
 everything went perfect and oysters that has 

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:38.600
 fact that in the end we finished third has 

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:39.770
 been really serious so nothing 

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:41.150
 I hope you liked to leave them for 

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:44.260
 massÃº cristian stage and we do not see the 

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:44.260
 next until after
