carbonization the tip of the frame lock
in<00:03:31.280> there<00:03:31.430> it<00:03:31.670> is<00:03:32.450> a<00:03:32.800> carbonized<00:03:33.800> which<00:03:34.790> helps

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:35.450 
in there it is a carbonized which helps

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:37.420 
in there it is a carbonized which helps
wear<00:03:35.870> resistance<00:03:36.530> is<00:03:36.709> just<00:03:36.920> a<00:03:37.010> thick<00:03:37.220> layer<00:03:37.370> of

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:37.430 
wear resistance is just a thick layer of

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:40.720 
wear resistance is just a thick layer of
tungsten<00:03:38.290> helps<00:03:39.290> wear<00:03:39.920> resistance<00:03:40.459> so<00:03:40.610> it

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:40.730 
tungsten helps wear resistance so it

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:43.390 
tungsten helps wear resistance so it
doesn't<00:03:40.940> wear<00:03:41.060> down<00:03:41.269> quite<00:03:41.540> as<00:03:41.660> fast<00:03:42.100> as<00:03:43.100> well

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:43.400 
doesn't wear down quite as fast as well

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:46.090 
doesn't wear down quite as fast as well
as<00:03:43.700> its<00:03:44.060> supposed<00:03:44.150> to<00:03:44.420> help<00:03:44.690> keep<00:03:45.380> any<00:03:45.769> kind<00:03:46.070> of

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:46.100 
as its supposed to help keep any kind of

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:47.949 
as its supposed to help keep any kind of
stickiness<00:03:46.489> so<00:03:47.239> whenever<00:03:47.420> you're<00:03:47.660> going<00:03:47.720> to

00:03:47.949 --> 00:03:47.959 
stickiness so whenever you're going to

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:49.390 
stickiness so whenever you're going to
unlock<00:03:48.230> it<00:03:48.260> it<00:03:48.500> shouldn't<00:03:48.709> stick<00:03:49.010> to<00:03:49.160> it<00:03:49.250> too

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:49.400 
unlock it it shouldn't stick to it too

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:53.830 
unlock it it shouldn't stick to it too
well<00:03:51.400> the<00:03:52.400> other<00:03:52.519> side<00:03:52.820> here<00:03:53.120> has<00:03:53.209> got<00:03:53.390> g10

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:53.840 
well the other side here has got g10

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:57.789 
well the other side here has got g10

anyway<00:05:00.990> as<00:05:01.140> far<00:05:01.170> as<00:05:01.560> changing<00:05:02.190> that<00:05:02.490> out<00:05:02.700> it

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:02.850 
anyway as far as changing that out it

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:04.520 
anyway as far as changing that out it
shouldn't<00:05:03.120> be<00:05:03.180> too<00:05:03.330> hard<00:05:03.360> just<00:05:03.720> take<00:05:04.350> those

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:04.530 
shouldn't be too hard just take those

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:07.010 
shouldn't be too hard just take those
couple<00:05:04.830> of<00:05:04.920> screws<00:05:05.190> out<00:05:05.370> right<00:05:05.610> there<00:05:05.850> the<00:05:06.660> g10

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:07.020 
couple of screws out right there the g10

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:08.660 
couple of screws out right there the g10
scales<00:05:07.200> just<00:05:07.590> pops<00:05:07.770> right<00:05:07.920> off<00:05:08.040> and<00:05:08.400> put<00:05:08.580> the

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:08.670 
scales just pops right off and put the

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:11.210 
scales just pops right off and put the
new<00:05:08.700> scale<00:05:09.030> on<00:05:09.210> top<00:05:09.710> however<00:05:10.710> those<00:05:10.950> scales

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:11.220 
new scale on top however those scales

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:14.540 
new scale on top however those scales
are<00:05:11.450> $65<00:05:12.450> so<00:05:13.170> that's<00:05:13.560> something<00:05:13.860> else<00:05:14.100> to<00:05:14.310> head

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:14.550 
are $65 so that's something else to head

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:18.860 
are $65 so that's something else to head
to<00:05:14.700> the<00:05:14.730> cost<00:05:15.620> the<00:05:16.620> the<00:05:17.040> knife<00:05:17.280> is<00:05:18.210> five<00:05:18.600> point

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:18.870 
to the cost the the knife is five point

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:20.570 
to the cost the the knife is five point
eight<00:05:19.050> ounces<00:05:19.440> so<00:05:19.650> it<00:05:19.800> is<00:05:19.920> a<00:05:19.950> heavier<00:05:20.400> knife

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:20.580 
eight ounces so it is a heavier knife

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:22.550 
eight ounces so it is a heavier knife
