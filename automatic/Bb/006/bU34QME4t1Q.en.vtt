our our second commissary which just

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
opened and so now it's so large that we

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.870 
opened and so now it's so large that we
we're<00:01:28.170> kind<00:01:28.530> of<00:01:28.619> forced<00:01:28.860> to<00:01:29.159> open<00:01:29.430> more<00:01:29.790> stores

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
we're kind of forced to open more stores

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.020 
we're kind of forced to open more stores
now<00:01:30.270> just<00:01:31.229> to<00:01:31.470> factor<00:01:32.250> in<00:01:32.369> some<00:01:32.549> of<00:01:32.670> that<00:01:32.700> cost

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
now just to factor in some of that cost

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.510 
now just to factor in some of that cost
because<00:01:33.360> that<00:01:33.509> Factory<00:01:34.049> is<00:01:34.310> 60,000<00:01:35.310> square

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
because that Factory is 60,000 square

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.510 
because that Factory is 60,000 square
feet<00:01:35.729> and<00:01:36.020> we<00:01:37.020> try<00:01:37.380> to<00:01:37.439> go<00:01:37.619> as<00:01:37.710> automated<00:01:38.070> as<00:01:38.369> we

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
feet and we try to go as automated as we

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:39.980 
feet and we try to go as automated as we
could<00:01:38.729> so<00:01:38.909> we<00:01:39.030> spend<00:01:39.270> a<00:01:39.329> lot<00:01:39.479> of<00:01:39.509> money<00:01:39.659> on<00:01:39.840> that

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
could so we spend a lot of money on that

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.859 
could so we spend a lot of money on that
and<00:01:40.290> it<00:01:40.979> came<00:01:41.100> out<00:01:41.250> really<00:01:41.430> nice<00:01:41.670> but<00:01:42.119> again

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
and it came out really nice but again

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.929 
and it came out really nice but again
the<00:01:43.079> cost<00:01:43.290> of<00:01:43.619> running<00:01:43.979> that<00:01:44.130> factory<00:01:44.549> or<00:01:44.759> that

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
the cost of running that factory or that

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:49.069 
the cost of running that factory or that
main<00:01:45.540> bakery<00:01:45.960> is<00:01:46.619> God<00:01:47.270> it's<00:01:48.270> really<00:01:48.600> high<00:01:48.750> so

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
main bakery is God it's really high so

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.109 
main bakery is God it's really high so
we<00:01:49.229> need<00:01:49.380> to<00:01:49.470> offset<00:01:49.619> that<00:01:49.890> so<00:01:50.729> now<00:01:50.970> we're

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
we need to offset that so now we're

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:52.929 
we need to offset that so now we're
committed<00:01:51.509> to<00:01:51.630> opening<00:01:51.990> two<00:01:52.110> or<00:01:52.229> three<00:01:52.439> stores

00:01:52.929 --> 00:01:52.939 
committed to opening two or three stores

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:55.399 
committed to opening two or three stores
currently<00:01:53.939> we<00:01:54.090> have<00:01:54.119> about<00:01:54.390> 850<00:01:55.290> employees

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:00.590 
and we have a lot of customers I think

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:03.920 
and we have a lot of customers I think
we<00:02:01.590> see<00:02:01.829> about<00:02:02.100> these<00:02:02.969> are<00:02:03.119> estimates<00:02:03.540> but<00:02:03.810> we

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
we see about these are estimates but we

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:05.719 
we see about these are estimates but we
think<00:02:04.140> between<00:02:04.469> the<00:02:04.770> three<00:02:04.799> stores<00:02:05.280> we<00:02:05.490> see

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
think between the three stores we see

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:07.270 
think between the three stores we see
about<00:02:05.969> 60<00:02:06.360> million<00:02:06.540> custard

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:07.280 
about 60 million custard

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:10.600 
about 60 million custard
so<00:02:07.880> that's<00:02:08.060> what<00:02:08.210> we're<00:02:08.330> at<00:02:08.479> today
