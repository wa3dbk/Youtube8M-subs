00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:10.559
 hello fellow orphanages 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:13.679
 don't be frightened about this video is black and 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:16.350
 wit we go back in time and green 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:17.130
 we must see that we have a lot of knowledge 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.890
 of joints 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:23.430
 has been lost and that is a pity 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.990
 this knowledge lost knowledge is also how 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.510
 most 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.770
 from now on a recurring phenomenon 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:32.070
 oasis wednesday 

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:34.769
 grandmother the dot today this 23 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:37.050
 the elderberry liqueur here are berries 

00:00:34.769 --> 00:00:38.879
 namely, common Netherlands but 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.280
 not already popular perhaps is the 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:43.289
 by the sour taste but that means 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:46.350
 no killing nothing can do today 

00:00:43.289 --> 00:00:48.749
 and your it is mine I sit with here 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:51.749
 so picked from a tree 

00:00:48.749 --> 00:00:53.640
 and four human but only on demand 

00:00:51.749 --> 00:00:55.710
 always permission to use the elderberry 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.019
 plucks were allowed to stand on a tree-eaten row 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:01.319
 what we need for the four 

00:00:58.019 --> 00:01:04.460
 more nauseous than it is for around 300 

00:01:01.319 --> 00:01:08.100
 grams of elderberries at least 200 grams of sugar 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:10.320
 and alcoholic beverage of at least 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.390
 these are ingredients that we need 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:15.240
 and then it's pretty simple 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:18.750
 pack an assistant bottle to funnel 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:21.380
 and actually everything is allowed together 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.380
 so then we do 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:24.909
 refurbishment 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.920
 because we clearly have everything in a bottle 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.299
 because turn the cap and not yet because we 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.039
 namely the chemical reaction 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:41.789
 take place between the sugar 

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:44.789
 alcohol and 4 we do a plastic one 

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:45.990
 foil over it and exchange it for us and cap 

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:48.179
 lights up 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.039
 squeeze is a bottle so we feel that 

00:01:48.179 --> 00:01:50.819
 we can still get out of the air but no more 

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:53.280
 within 

00:01:50.819 --> 00:01:56.100
 this is what we want carbon from and 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:58.200
 it can no longer put oxygen in just four 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.250
 weeks of waiting we have a nice and 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.929
 strong 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.909
 liqueurs to slash the fall ' 

00:02:00.929 --> 00:02:05.579
 during the winter months 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:08.009
 something that our ancestors as early as 1615 

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:09.720
 west because then they reported 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:12.000
 about the medical effect of the video 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.349
 with it would be good against one 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.480
 good bowel movements 

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:17.250
 the wheel against faster and it helped 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.260
 against excess mucus 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:21.900
 against rose and to top it all 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:25.380
 if it's also good for the line 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:27.989
 so a panacea but do not drink 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:31.310
 under 18 and drink in moderation 

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:35.670
 please because yes these are happy falco 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:37.980
 our ancestors my 16th or 17th century 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:40.859
 knew the same 4s and dog desk 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:43.620
 deep down it just works from the trees 

00:02:40.859 --> 00:02:46.470
 free unfortunately allowed leading in the Netherlands 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:47.100
 officially don't do it but watch 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:49.380
 Outside 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:52.110
 it's for the taking 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:54.870
 just let it be mine we had sun 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:57.450
 but my answer is just my loose 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:57.780
 not on itself so let's put it together 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:00.330
 to do 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:02.490
 because in the world of tomorrow there is none 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:06.980
 space for food 

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:06.980
 very fine masters follow people
