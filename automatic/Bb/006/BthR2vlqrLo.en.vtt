00:00:00.933 --> 00:00:02.500
 - Welcome an example 

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:05.833
 How to find the base number in parallel, 

00:00:05.833 --> 00:00:08.367
 The intersection of the two groups. 

00:00:08.367 --> 00:00:11.733
 The base is how much ELEMENTS is in SET 

00:00:11.733 --> 00:00:13.900
 So when found CARDINALITY 

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:16.100
 We will count in a set of elements 

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:18.900
 Unlisted elements are in SET. 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.900
 Here we give the UNIVERSAL set U 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:23.700
 Contains integers 1 through 20. 

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:27.433
 Groups "A" and B are subgroups containing these elements. 

00:00:27.433 --> 00:00:31.600
 The number element we are looking for will be in SET "A" UNION B. 

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:36.033
 Please remember this symbol HERE union means or. 

00:00:36.033 --> 00:00:42.033
 SO we can also say that the phone number is set in the "A" molecule or B. 

00:00:43.767 --> 00:00:46.100
 a set of bases we want to explain 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:48.533
 Use to show these two notations here. 

00:00:48.533 --> 00:00:50.833
 I listed. 

00:00:50.833 --> 00:00:52.233
 We also want to find the number element 

00:00:52.233 --> 00:00:55.200
 "A" INTERSECT B in the settings 

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.233
 Or the number of elements "A" intersection B. 

00:00:59.233 --> 00:01:03.140
 This symbol intersection also means and. 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:06.207
 So we can imagine it as the number of AS elements 

00:01:06.207 --> 00:01:10.307
 In the "A" set with B. 

00:01:10.307 --> 00:01:14.540
 Although it is not necessary for LET'S to solve this using Venn diagram, 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:16.640
 Let us first determine THE ELEMENTS 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:21.173
 At the same time set "A" and SET B. 

00:01:21.173 --> 00:01:27.173
 Note that 1, 6, 8, 14, and 16 are the only elements 

00:01:30.707 --> 00:01:34.007
 At the same time set "A" and SET B. 

00:01:34.007 --> 00:01:36.973
 These elements will be displayed in this overlapping area HERE 

00:01:36.973 --> 00:01:39.173
 In order to show them at BOTH "A" B. 

00:01:39.173 --> 00:01:42.040
 So let's move on and list the same. 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:48.040
 We are again 1, 6, 8, 14, and 16. 

00:01:49.973 --> 00:01:53.240
 So now the remaining elements of LOOKING AT SET "A" 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:55.307
 Only at SET "A" 

00:01:55.307 --> 00:01:58.273
 Therefore, these elements will become HERE in this region 

00:01:58.273 --> 00:02:04.273
 This will be 4, 11, 15, 17, 18, 19, and 20. 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:10.547
 Now look at SET B, 

00:02:10.547 --> 00:02:13.447
 Please note how ELEMENTS THAT only exists in collection B 

00:02:13.447 --> 00:02:19.447
 For 3, 5, 9, and 13. 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:20.880
 We have all the information we need 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:23.047
 TO answers these two questions 

00:02:23.047 --> 00:02:24.747
 But let us COMPLETE our Venn diagram 

00:02:24.747 --> 00:02:28.213
 By measuring the elements in the complete set 

00:02:28.213 --> 00:02:30.547
 But not in "A" or B. 

00:02:30.547 --> 00:02:33.113
 So if we come to count 1 to 20 

00:02:33.113 --> 00:02:39.047
 Please note how 2 is not "A" or B but either the complete set. 

00:02:39.047 --> 00:02:41.313
 SO 2 will produce HERE 

00:02:41.313 --> 00:02:43.213
 Then we have 3, 4, 5, 6 

00:02:43.213 --> 00:02:45.980
 Note 7 is not counted as "A" or B. 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:47.847
 SO 7 is a complete set as well. 

00:02:47.847 --> 00:02:50.380
 SO 7 is here. 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:53.947
 8,9,10Remark 10 is not "A" or B 

00:02:53.947 --> 00:02:56.147
 SO 10 will be here. 

00:02:56.147 --> 00:02:58.947
 11,12,12 notices are not in "A" or B 

00:02:58.947 --> 00:03:03.153
 SO 12 will come out of HERE in universal SET 

00:03:03.153 --> 00:03:07.853
 And I think 13 to 20 are here, in "A" or B. 

00:03:07.853 --> 00:03:10.220
 Let us now answer our two questions. 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:12.320
 The first question is the number of DETERMINE elements 

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:16.087
 Or the base "A" UNION B pair 

00:03:16.087 --> 00:03:19.687
 How much is this in the "A" molecule or B? 

00:03:19.687 --> 00:03:23.420
 Or the number of elements in this area. 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:24.787
 So we can count the number of elements 

00:03:24.787 --> 00:03:26.353
 In this area 

00:03:26.353 --> 00:03:27.320
 But we also pay attention 

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:30.587
 Complete set of CONTAINS 20 elements, 

00:03:30.587 --> 00:03:33.020
 Fourth, can not be in "A" or B. 

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:36.653
 20 - 4 16 

00:03:36.653 --> 00:03:40.287
 So NUMBER is in the "A" UNION family element 

00:03:40.287 --> 00:03:42.387
 It will be 16. 

00:03:42.387 --> 00:03:44.287
 Of course, we can verify this by calculation. 

00:03:44.287 --> 00:03:50.287
 We have 3, 5, 7, 10, 12, 14, 16 

00:03:51.487 --> 00:03:54.287
 Now for the second question. 

00:03:54.287 --> 00:03:59.420
 We want to determine the number of elements in the "A" INTERSECT family 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:02.727
 Or base "A" INTERSECT B 

00:04:02.727 --> 00:04:07.260
 This will be NUMBER in the "A" AND B element, 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:10.327
 The number of elements in this area. 

00:04:10.327 --> 00:04:15.827
 Please note that there are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 elements at this intersection. 

00:04:15.827 --> 00:04:19.793
 Therefore the base "A" INTERSECT B 

00:04:19.793 --> 00:04:25.793
 Or the number of elements is at "A" INTERSECT B IS 5. 

00:04:25.993 --> 00:04:29.827
 I hope you find this helpful.
