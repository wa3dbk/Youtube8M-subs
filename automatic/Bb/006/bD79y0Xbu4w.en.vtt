 that cedeti industrial fishing finally installs 

00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:24.919
 to exploit Syrian resources 

00:00:24.919 --> 00:00:26.610
 being the coasts of the zone 

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:28.689
 as they have done on previous occasions 

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:33.100
 we do not ass no more but the few resources to exploit 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:34.410
 they are staying 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.260
 in that tenor the local fishing leader cristian miranda 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.540
 He stressed that in the face of this threat that there has been a movement 

00:00:40.539 --> 00:00:44.470
 really historic for the sector artisanal fishermen in the area 

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:46.739
 they gave an agreement with the eighth region 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:50.010
 to defend the agility of the industrialists we are not 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.079
 getting to be what we are able to do business with many difficulties 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:57.390
 what we do not agree with and who tried to lynch the inmates 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:58.660
 region and 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:00.250
 small the origins 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:04.300
 the stand that is a person who has been unfortunately requested 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:05.740
 by the industrial sector 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:08.920
 and that's what we do not want, cristian miranda stressed that in another 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:12.149
 zone and more than 100 vessels that work with this resource 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:15.860
 If you want to do the same, directly more than four hundred depend 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:16.830
 families 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.210
 besides the indirect works that the extraction of the cia provides 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:21.390
 reason why 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.260
 it is very important to protect 

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:25.380
 the appeal was not made 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:31.810
 had authorities since I have use reason of 100 has the solution ieea 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:34.810
 taxes and spokespersons of the march is trying to choose 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:36.890
 and again 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:40.250
 two new smoke hospitals and for today that the workers can 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:44.450
 and that's not going to do we have local fishing men who are 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:47.329
 the complementary work a same work detraction of the activity 

00:01:47.329 --> 00:01:50.729
 They pointed out that the resource for industrial fishing should be invaded 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:54.720
 unemployment will end very short term our area will abound 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.160
 the pier of the island was already reaching explode the substance found in the 

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.800
 ejido 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:01.970
 those areas where you have to give 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:03.830
 we start labor 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:05.630
 which to clean 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:10.069
 but based on analyzes made by several close associates another fishing leader 

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:13.829
 They are Miguel Angel Hernandez explained that the area and almost the entire country 

00:02:13.829 --> 00:02:15.929
 working long time ago 

00:02:15.929 --> 00:02:19.269
 and that the idea of ​​defending the land saved for exclusive exploitation 

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:20.950
 of artisanal fishing 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:23.039
 it is not new for example 

00:02:23.039 --> 00:02:26.499
 percent in the one that has the craft goal 

00:02:26.499 --> 00:02:30.849
 with a class access as the proxy and another issue that has to do with the 

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:32.709
 legislation 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:36.739
 the appointment has been working so long this issue as the wind that started 

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:39.739
 take strength and that is staged in regional alliances 

00:02:40.369 --> 00:02:43.399
 all in the framework of the defense of a very important resource for many 

00:02:43.399 --> 00:02:45.419
 Seamen and their families 

00:02:45.419 --> 00:02:48.620
 In addition to all the dirty work to the extraction of this resource 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:51.660
 one of the few that have not been devastated by industrial fishing 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:54.320
 but that are now in the sights of the sector
