00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
 and now the details of Akmola region 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:06.299
 provides almost half now 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:08.280
 the capital market of milk and meat 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:10.469
 however, the bread region represents 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.910
 Astana’s food belt is not 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:12.870
 should be limited to development 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.759
 agricultural sector 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.650
 Nursultan Nazarbayev during the working 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:18.779
 trips to the Akmola region put 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.470
 the challenge to develop the industry is 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:23.400
 including engineering and processing 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:25.019
 milk bluegill 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.490
 this is one of the leading processing 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:28.560
 enterprises in the region from all other 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.449
 country but differs in that already through 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.520
 a couple of months a new one will be launched here 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:34.860
 workshop and then the plant will become one of 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.140
 few producing baby food 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.059
 issue price of almost 4 billion tenge 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.710
 highlighted by roadmap 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:46.860
 the novelty of the project is that we 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:50.910
 combined tasks and experience natural 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:53.100
 raw materials and new technologies namely milk 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:56.039
 enriched with vitamins and minerals and 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:58.590
 also 100 dairy products produced 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:00.629
 in a thermostatic way right now on this 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:03.120
 the company employs 175 people 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:05.339
 production capacity of 160 tons of products 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.110
 per day but this is not the limit of the president yet 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.780
 once recalled that Okkama fishing line 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:15.290
 milk rivers need to expand and more active 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:17.960
 guide the capital produced by how much 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:20.640
 50,000 tons 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:23.490
 annual production of 130 tons 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.680
 let's say the year will increase the sale of the name 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.190
 Cargoes are precisely many enterprises 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.540
 which 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:30.270
 address of the wedding of the city of Astana 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:32.550
 component is 45 percent milk and 47 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.350
 percent meat i also key promise 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:35.330
 the head of state has already designated and 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.900
 meeting with local 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:38.040
 agricultural producers one of 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.600
 problems faced 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.490
 businessmen market 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.650
 so for kamalyan cypher it is not at all 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.090
 problem i set the task to you 

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:47.580
 provided Astana 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:50.640
 this is a natural consumer you should 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:52.920
 rejoice in the disk yes true but for the past 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.490
 year I looked at milk for ten 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.830
 percent 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:58.440
 provision has increased for meat by 14 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:01.410
 percent the city ​​grows will be further 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:02.670
 grow and consumption will grow in 

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:04.920
 as a food belt 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:07.200
 the capital in the region is implemented 13 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:09.179
 projects of almost 38 billion tenge and 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.929
 among them dairy farms and 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.610
 greenhouses 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:13.770
 and the overall level of rural subsidies 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:16.709
 farms of the region over the past five years 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:19.320
 the villagers grew up 8 times today honestly 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:20.269
 say are on our feet the newest 

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:23.850
 equipment 

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:28.230
 thanks to your reforms we get 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:31.500
 subsidies to reduce the cost of diesel fuel on 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:33.420
 aqua seeds fishing line edge cereal capital 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:34.500
 countries such a characteristic of the region 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:36.330
 today gave the president 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.769
 however, from the level of development of rural 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:39.120
 farms are not lagging behind here and 

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:41.430
 industry one of the leading 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:43.140
 enterprises kamaz engineering open 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:44.549
 exactly 10 years ago by the way also with 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:46.290
 participation on sultan nazarbayev 

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:48.150
 enterprise only last year for 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:50.130
 military and rescue builders and 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:51.060
 oil workers produced more than 1200 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:53.820
 cars 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:55.430
 2015 plans to complete 

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:57.060
 investment project to create 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:59.250
 procurement area 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:00.840
 this will allow us to increase the proportion 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:05.750
 localization which today 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:11.220
 ranges from 25 to 40 percent 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:13.170
 raising to 38 50 percent ruler 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:15.239
 manufactured products 37 species 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:17.100
 dump trucks and special equipment 

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:18.900
 but the most important thing is that such 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:21.420
 large enterprises should serve 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:22.980
 catalyst for the development of local small and 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:25.560
 medium business 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:29.190
 many enterprises from those times left 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:31.760
 work empty rooms their task 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:34.530
 remember to work 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:37.200
 Kamaz is the result of an agreement with 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:39.420
 Russia joint damn further 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:41.489
 we will develop therefore gigantic 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:44.040
 of enterprises they create many workers 

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:46.319
 places and around this enterprise is small 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:48.569
 medium business and services 

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:50.459
 they create jobs, I'm always there 

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:51.780
 thirty six projects on six hundred 

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:53.790
 forty five billion tenge 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:55.620
 what are the plans for the second five year plan 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:58.019
 separately taken Akmola region 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:59.700
 and 25 of them will be introduced already in 

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:01.310
 this year, the head of state stressed 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:03.090
 what during the global crisis 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:05.190
 Kazakhstan industry gets 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:07.079
 new impulse for development only in this 

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:08.849
 seventy years will be launched in the country

 five new businesses work for them 

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:12.599
 will get about three thousand people 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:14.489
 let on behalf of bridge builders 

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:17.609

 complex trust the same national 

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:22.830
 touch the reform will surprise 

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:27.139
 I will not deliver as much as possible 

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:30.750
 you have to set the centralization Tomas 

00:04:27.139 --> 00:04:35.250
 main we have this side 

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:35.729
 first year can increase Akmola 

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:37.860

00:04:35.729 --> 00:04:39.450
 this is kazakhstan in miniature here in the world and 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:41.970

 the way is active development even during 

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:04.610
 crisis 

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:07.300
 our way of turning polyethnic and

 is an advantage to Kazakhstan 

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:20.840
