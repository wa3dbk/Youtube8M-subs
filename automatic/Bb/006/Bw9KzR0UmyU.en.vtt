00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:19.470
 we sit down with say thank you and it's 30 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:21.369
 madrid hello diego good morning 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.380
 we have here in the area today 

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:24.939
 children's attractions because we're going 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:27.369
 have a zone and nickelodeon the year that 

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:30.160
 come that can tell us about her good 

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:32.710
 the truth is that it is a comprehensive reform 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:35.440
 of child pain 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:38.890
 the area was quite old-fashioned and 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:41.829
 especially the children have changed a lot 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:44.530
 in terms of leisure formerly when 

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:47.410
 parents came with their children to a 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:50.379
 Park, they almost wanted to leave the 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:52.269
 children take a beer and be 

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:54.129
 quiet not today that kind of 

00:00:52.269 --> 00:00:55.809
 leisure has changed and parents what more 

00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:57.729
 demand is to be able to ride in the 

00:00:55.809 --> 00:00:59.589
 performances with the children then the 

00:00:57.729 --> 00:01:02.229
 goal of course is to make an area 

00:00:59.589 --> 00:01:05.050
 much more familiar and from the hand of a 

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:07.450
 great brand like nickelodeon that has 

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:09.460
 a number of characters 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:10.780
 impressive of the most seen in the 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:12.429
 world like spongebob dora the 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:15.759
 explorer jimmy neutron the turtles 

00:01:12.429 --> 00:01:19.899
 ninja fanboy chan chan the rugrats or 

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:21.810
 a wide range of characters that are 

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:25.300
 super known by the little ones 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.770
 I imagine that as patriotic sponge bob 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:30.009
 more will also be in the area this new 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:32.409
 obviously the goal is to make 

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:35.170
 a thematic life nickelodeon land where 

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:37.610
 both the attractions and the rest of 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:39.290
 restaurant services 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:42.320
 etcetera etcetera then they will leave 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:44.330
 themed with the characters of 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:45.950
 nickelodeon and when can we be a 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:47.840
 little more as he feels about that when 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:49.550
 is going to be the opening of each more or 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:52.370
 less good period the works go to 

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:53.600
 last long because as I tell you there 

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:56.479
 that make a very big restaurant and 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:58.670
 make a store you have to enter 

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:00.350
 enough attractions must be qualified 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:02.690
 another series of attractions that 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:04.460
 will remain in the area because for example 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:06.500
 the bumper cars is one of the 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:09.560
 attractions that the little ones like the most 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:11.030
 and the cars that are also new do not 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:13.250
 are set last year in everything 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:16.100
 that is done will be thematize all the 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:18.890
 attraction but there's a lot of work 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:22.400
 then we will be in works then 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:25.280
 since we have started until 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:26.680
 surely mid-end of March 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:30.770
 everything also depends on the weather 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:33.290
 and what the time allows us to be able to 

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:34.640
 to be able to work because I think we have 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:36.110
 what to do is not a little more in front already 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:37.610
 you can tell us more things in detail and 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:40.160
 sure to enjoy the new area that 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:41.730
 yes yes the goal is to have the list 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:44.090
 for 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:47.610
 to the week of the weeks before 2014 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:51.319
 and I think we will arrive on time 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:51.319
 thank you very much to you
