and B to C in music are always a fret
apart<00:01:04.920> no<00:01:05.159> matter<00:01:05.339> what<00:01:05.519> and<00:01:05.790> on<00:01:06.000> any

instrument to a half-step

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:10.969 
instrument to a half-step
so<00:01:09.930> we're<00:01:10.110> just<00:01:10.140> going<00:01:10.380> to<00:01:10.409> use<00:01:10.470> this<00:01:10.680> one

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
so we're just going to use this one

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:14.149 
so we're just going to use this one
shape<00:01:11.400> and<00:01:12.360> it<00:01:12.750> goes<00:01:13.020> like<00:01:13.080> this<00:01:13.200> the<00:01:13.920> first

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
shape and it goes like this the first

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:19.710 
shape and it goes like this the first
shape<00:01:14.430> is<00:01:14.729> a<00:01:15.720> G<00:01:16.020> major<00:01:16.500> Barre<00:01:17.490> chord

so<00:03:00.209> what<00:03:00.510> you<00:03:00.599> could<00:03:00.750> do<00:03:00.900> is<00:03:01.110> if<00:03:01.140> you're<00:03:01.470> still

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
so what you could do is if you're still

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:03.050 
so what you could do is if you're still
working<00:03:01.920> on<00:03:02.040> the<00:03:02.220> rhythm<00:03:02.670> there<00:03:02.819> you<00:03:02.940> could

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
working on the rhythm there you could

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.420 
working on the rhythm there you could
just<00:03:03.090> strum<00:03:04.019> the<00:03:04.140> down<00:03:04.319> strum<00:03:04.709> for<00:03:04.860> each<00:03:05.040> chord

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
just strum the down strum for each chord

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:07.789 
just strum the down strum for each chord
you<00:03:06.269> could<00:03:06.420> also<00:03:06.599> practice<00:03:07.019> it<00:03:07.319> as<00:03:07.500> power

00:03:07.789 --> 00:03:07.799 
you could also practice it as power

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:16.550 
you could also practice it as power
chords<00:03:14.569> if<00:03:15.569> it's<00:03:15.750> hard<00:03:15.959> to<00:03:16.049> go<00:03:16.170> from<00:03:16.349> this<00:03:16.500> and

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
chords if it's hard to go from this and

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.319 
chords if it's hard to go from this and
slide<00:03:17.069> it<00:03:17.250> all<00:03:17.370> the<00:03:17.400> way<00:03:17.519> up<00:03:17.609> in<00:03:17.849> time<00:03:18.030> to<00:03:18.060> the

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:18.329 
slide it all the way up in time to the

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:20.059 
slide it all the way up in time to the
eighth<00:03:18.480> fret<00:03:18.720> you<00:03:19.019> could<00:03:19.170> play<00:03:19.319> a<00:03:19.349> regular<00:03:19.590> C

00:03:20.059 --> 00:03:20.069 
eighth fret you could play a regular C

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:28.789 
eighth fret you could play a regular C
major<00:03:20.280> chord<00:03:20.489> as<00:03:20.879> the<00:03:21.030> last<00:03:21.209> chord<00:03:21.510> like<00:03:27.799> you

00:03:28.789 --> 00:03:28.799 
major chord as the last chord like you

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:31.580

could<00:03:28.950> do<00:03:29.040> it<00:03:29.129> like<00:03:29.160> that<00:03:30.260> but<00:03:31.260> you<00:03:31.560> know

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590 
could do it like that but you know

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:33.080 
could do it like that but you know
basically<00:03:32.129> it's<00:03:32.250> just<00:03:32.310> good<00:03:32.700> to<00:03:32.879> start

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.090 
basically it's just good to start

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:35.210 
basically it's just good to start
practicing<00:03:33.599> that<00:03:33.660> sliding<00:03:34.170> Barre<00:03:34.590> chord<00:03:34.920> and

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:35.220 
practicing that sliding Barre chord and

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:37.699 
practicing that sliding Barre chord and
also<00:03:36.120> you<00:03:36.180> know<00:03:36.420> to<00:03:36.450> the<00:03:36.959> same<00:03:37.170> shape<00:03:37.470> moved

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:37.709 
also you know to the same shape moved
