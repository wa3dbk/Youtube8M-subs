00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:15.249 
throwing mechanics and this question
strikes<00:00:14.179> near<00:00:14.780> and<00:00:14.900> dear<00:00:14.990> to<00:00:15.019> my<00:00:15.230> heart

strikes near and dear to my heart

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:16.870 
strikes near and dear to my heart
because<00:00:15.740> I<00:00:15.769> used<00:00:16.070> to<00:00:16.160> do<00:00:16.369> this<00:00:16.550> as<00:00:16.849> a

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:16.880 
because I used to do this as a

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:19.870 
because I used to do this as a
quarterback<00:00:17.380> the<00:00:18.380> question<00:00:18.829> was<00:00:19.040> this<00:00:19.579> young

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:19.880 
quarterback the question was this young

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:22.150 
quarterback the question was this young
man<00:00:20.090> when<00:00:20.300> he<00:00:20.329> throws<00:00:20.630> a<00:00:20.660> football<00:00:21.200> the<00:00:21.829> spin

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:22.160 
man when he throws a football the spin

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:25.630 
man when he throws a football the spin
is<00:00:22.340> tight<00:00:22.610> the<00:00:23.450> trajectory<00:00:24.110> is<00:00:24.290> good<00:00:24.529> but<00:00:25.430> the

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:25.640 
is tight the trajectory is good but the

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:28.659 
is tight the trajectory is good but the
football<00:00:26.119> actually<00:00:26.419> begins<00:00:27.140> to<00:00:27.410> turn<00:00:27.800> in<00:00:28.189> the

00:00:28.659 --> 00:00:28.669 
football actually begins to turn in the

00:00:28.669 --> 00:00:32.290 
football actually begins to turn in the
air<00:00:28.820> and<00:00:30.189> if<00:00:31.189> you've<00:00:31.430> never<00:00:31.610> experienced<00:00:32.180> that

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:32.300 
air and if you've never experienced that

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:34.690 
air and if you've never experienced that
as<00:00:32.450> a<00:00:32.480> quarterback<00:00:33.040> just<00:00:34.040> wait<00:00:34.280> it'll<00:00:34.520> happen

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:34.700 
as a quarterback just wait it'll happen

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:36.970 
as a quarterback just wait it'll happen
to<00:00:34.910> you<00:00:35.090> I<00:00:35.360> want<00:00:35.870> to<00:00:35.930> show<00:00:36.110> you<00:00:36.170> mechanically

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:36.980 
to you I want to show you mechanically

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:40.090 
to you I want to show you mechanically
why<00:00:37.220> that<00:00:37.490> happens<00:00:38.500> when<00:00:39.500> I<00:00:39.530> would<00:00:39.770> throw<00:00:39.980> it

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:40.100 
why that happens when I would throw it

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:41.710 
why that happens when I would throw it
that<00:00:40.220> way<00:00:40.370> in<00:00:40.520> high<00:00:40.640> school<00:00:40.910> my<00:00:41.180> receivers

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:41.720 
that way in high school my receivers

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:43.270 
that way in high school my receivers
would<00:00:41.870> tell<00:00:42.050> me<00:00:42.170> hey<00:00:42.320> I<00:00:42.350> like<00:00:42.650> that<00:00:42.890> thing<00:00:43.250> that

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:43.280 
would tell me hey I like that thing that

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:46.300 
would tell me hey I like that thing that
you<00:00:43.670> throw<00:00:44.000> that<00:00:44.240> turns<00:00:44.570> this<00:00:44.930> way<00:00:44.990> and<00:00:45.950> I<00:00:46.130> said

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:46.310 
you throw that turns this way and I said

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:48.130 
you throw that turns this way and I said
well<00:00:46.460> I'm<00:00:46.579> really<00:00:47.030> not<00:00:47.150> trying<00:00:47.480> to<00:00:47.750> do<00:00:47.960> that

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:48.140 
well I'm really not trying to do that

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:50.620 
well I'm really not trying to do that
I'd<00:00:48.680> rather<00:00:49.040> the<00:00:49.280> ball<00:00:49.460> be<00:00:49.700> pointed<00:00:50.150> over<00:00:50.390> and

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:50.630 
I'd rather the ball be pointed over and

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:54.100 
I'd rather the ball be pointed over and
that's<00:00:50.840> much<00:00:51.260> easier<00:00:51.290> to<00:00:51.800> catch<00:00:52.810> in<00:00:53.810> the

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:54.110 
that's much easier to catch in the

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:57.340 
that's much easier to catch in the
release<00:00:54.500> as<00:00:54.800> in<00:00:55.579> the<00:00:56.000> carriage<00:00:56.480> of<00:00:56.750> the<00:00:56.780> ball

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:57.350 
release as in the carriage of the ball

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:59.979 
release as in the carriage of the ball
I'd<00:00:57.800> like<00:00:58.220> the<00:00:58.460> back<00:00:58.700> of<00:00:58.730> my<00:00:59.030> throwing<00:00:59.690> hand

00:00:59.979 --> 00:00:59.989 
I'd like the back of my throwing hand

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:03.999 
I'd like the back of my throwing hand
that<00:01:00.620> wrist<00:01:00.980> area<00:01:01.220> to<00:01:01.850> be<00:01:02.000> flat<00:01:02.420> if<00:01:02.750> it<00:01:03.530> begins

00:01:03.999 --> 00:01:04.009 
that wrist area to be flat if it begins

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:07.080 
that wrist area to be flat if it begins
to<00:01:04.430> do<00:01:04.640> this<00:01:05.299> and<00:01:05.720> I'm<00:01:06.350> going<00:01:06.530> to<00:01:06.560> tell<00:01:06.830> you

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:07.090 
to do this and I'm going to tell you

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:10.600 
to do this and I'm going to tell you
this<00:01:08.090> almost<00:01:08.570> always<00:01:08.840> happens<00:01:09.530> to<00:01:09.830> baseball

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:10.610 
this almost always happens to baseball

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:13.090 
this almost always happens to baseball
football<00:01:10.880> combination<00:01:11.420> guys<00:01:12.100> because

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:13.100 
football combination guys because

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:16.420 
football combination guys because
anytime<00:01:13.640> we<00:01:13.820> throw<00:01:14.150> a<00:01:14.180> curveball<00:01:14.560> we<00:01:15.560> get<00:01:15.830> this

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:16.430 
anytime we throw a curveball we get this

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:18.640 
anytime we throw a curveball we get this
if<00:01:17.210> you<00:01:17.420> were<00:01:17.540> a<00:01:17.570> golfer<00:01:18.080> we'd<00:01:18.229> call<00:01:18.440> that<00:01:18.620> a

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:18.650 
if you were a golfer we'd call that a

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:22.360 
if you were a golfer we'd call that a
cupped<00:01:19.010> wrist<00:01:19.840> anytime<00:01:20.840> you<00:01:21.409> cup<00:01:21.830> your<00:01:22.100> wrist

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:22.370 
cupped wrist anytime you cup your wrist

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:25.990 
cupped wrist anytime you cup your wrist
and<00:01:22.640> you<00:01:22.909> lose<00:01:23.180> this<00:01:23.560> vertical<00:01:24.560> plane<00:01:25.000> your

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:26.000 
and you lose this vertical plane your

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.140 
and you lose this vertical plane your
hand<00:01:26.420> turns<00:01:26.810> under<00:01:27.530> the<00:01:27.710> ball<00:01:27.920> and<00:01:28.220> when<00:01:28.970> we

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:29.150 
hand turns under the ball and when we

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:32.620 
hand turns under the ball and when we
release<00:01:29.659> it<00:01:29.690> and<00:01:30.110> let<00:01:30.350> go<00:01:31.299> instead<00:01:32.299> of<00:01:32.479> it

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:32.630 
release it and let go instead of it

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:35.890 
release it and let go instead of it
being<00:01:32.659> linear<00:01:33.560> force<00:01:34.040> the<00:01:34.909> force<00:01:35.210> ends<00:01:35.780> up

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:35.900 
being linear force the force ends up

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:39.010 
being linear force the force ends up
being<00:01:36.200> across<00:01:36.920> the<00:01:37.310> ball<00:01:37.520> from<00:01:38.450> right<00:01:38.540> to<00:01:38.780> left

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:39.020 
being across the ball from right to left

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:42.280 
being across the ball from right to left
so<00:01:39.560> the<00:01:39.979> ball<00:01:40.159> will<00:01:40.430> start<00:01:40.850> straight<00:01:41.299> but<00:01:42.140> as

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:42.290 
so the ball will start straight but as

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:44.440 
so the ball will start straight but as
it<00:01:42.530> loses<00:01:42.770> speed<00:01:43.130> and<00:01:43.520> falls<00:01:43.790> out<00:01:44.000> of<00:01:44.119> the<00:01:44.210> air

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:44.450 
it loses speed and falls out of the air

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:49.060 
it loses speed and falls out of the air
it<00:01:45.080> will<00:01:45.380> turn<00:01:46.479> the<00:01:47.479> same<00:01:47.869> way<00:01:48.170> my<00:01:48.409> hand<00:01:48.799> turned

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:49.070 
it will turn the same way my hand turned

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:51.490 
it will turn the same way my hand turned
when<00:01:49.400> I<00:01:49.430> got<00:01:49.700> under<00:01:50.119> the<00:01:50.299> ball<00:01:50.479> now<00:01:51.260> there's<00:01:51.439> a

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:51.500 
when I got under the ball now there's a

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:53.830 
when I got under the ball now there's a
great<00:01:51.740> drill<00:01:52.040> and<00:01:52.310> you<00:01:52.939> maybe<00:01:53.330> you<00:01:53.479> want<00:01:53.630> to<00:01:53.689> do

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:53.840 
great drill and you maybe you want to do

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:57.070 
great drill and you maybe you want to do
this<00:01:54.070> against<00:01:55.070> a<00:01:55.159> stucco<00:01:55.549> wall<00:01:56.030> and<00:01:56.330> then<00:01:56.960> you

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:57.080 
this against a stucco wall and then you

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:59.380 
this against a stucco wall and then you
won't<00:01:57.260> forget<00:01:57.619> the<00:01:57.830> drill<00:01:58.070> you<00:01:58.520> stand<00:01:59.180> as

00:01:59.380 --> 00:01:59.390 
won't forget the drill you stand as

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:01.539 
won't forget the drill you stand as
close<00:01:59.570> to<00:01:59.840> that<00:01:59.869> stucco<00:02:00.320> wall<00:02:00.680> as<00:02:00.860> you<00:02:00.890> can<00:02:01.220> so

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:01.549 
close to that stucco wall as you can so

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:05.800 
close to that stucco wall as you can so
it's<00:02:01.759> right<00:02:02.000> here<00:02:02.360> and<00:02:02.540> you<00:02:03.470> throw<00:02:04.810> making

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:05.810 
it's right here and you throw making

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:08.919 
it's right here and you throw making
sure<00:02:06.110> that<00:02:06.470> as<00:02:06.710> you<00:02:06.979> load<00:02:07.310> the<00:02:07.549> ball<00:02:07.759> and<00:02:08.119> start

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:08.929 
sure that as you load the ball and start

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:11.289 
sure that as you load the ball and start
your<00:02:09.110> throwing<00:02:09.409> motion<00:02:09.560> that<00:02:10.489> your<00:02:10.819> elbow

your throwing motion that your elbow

your throwing motion that your elbow
gets<00:02:11.659> out<00:02:11.870> here<00:02:12.379> when<00:02:12.560> you<00:02:12.709> release<00:02:13.069> it<00:02:13.099> not

this<00:02:13.939> way<00:02:14.180> you'll<00:02:14.989> skin<00:02:15.349> this

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 
this way you'll skin this

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:18.850 
this way you'll skin this
enough<00:02:15.830> time<00:02:16.099> to<00:02:16.129> figure<00:02:16.519> it<00:02:16.640> out<00:02:16.819> and<00:02:17.200> if<00:02:18.200> your

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:18.860 
enough time to figure it out and if your

that two or three times pretty soon you

you're in this position and we let go of

you're in this position and we let go of
the<00:02:38.510> ball<00:02:38.660> I've<00:02:39.530> had<00:02:39.739> all<00:02:40.010> kinds<00:02:40.430> of<00:02:40.489> questions

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:40.910 
the ball I've had all kinds of questions

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:42.670 
the ball I've had all kinds of questions
about<00:02:41.030> what<00:02:41.660> should<00:02:41.810> my<00:02:41.989> hand<00:02:42.290> look<00:02:42.470> like

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:42.680 
about what should my hand look like

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:44.470 
about what should my hand look like
after<00:02:43.040> I<00:02:43.069> let<00:02:43.280> it<00:02:43.400> go<00:02:43.549> should<00:02:43.790> it<00:02:43.879> go<00:02:44.000> this<00:02:44.239> way

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:44.480 
after I let it go should it go this way

should<00:02:44.780> it<00:02:44.840> go<00:02:44.989> this<00:02:45.230> way<00:02:45.610> once<00:02:46.610> the<00:02:46.879> ball<00:02:47.060> is

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.090 
should it go this way once the ball is

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:50.740 
should it go this way once the ball is
gone<00:02:47.599> and<00:02:47.989> we<00:02:48.769> started<00:02:49.250> with<00:02:49.430> this<00:02:49.730> and<00:02:50.090> our

point out haven't had many where the

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:14.660 
point turned in you'd have to be a

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:16.180 
point turned in you'd have to be a
pretty<00:03:14.870> good<00:03:14.959> curveball<00:03:15.379> pitcher<00:03:15.709> to<00:03:15.829> do<00:03:15.980> that

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:16.190 
pretty good curveball pitcher to do that

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:18.910 
pretty good curveball pitcher to do that
but<00:03:17.000> that's<00:03:17.180> a<00:03:17.329> very<00:03:17.750> common<00:03:18.140> question<00:03:18.440> that<00:03:18.890> I

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:18.920 
but that's a very common question that I

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:21.370 
but that's a very common question that I
get<00:03:19.329> normally<00:03:20.329> we<00:03:20.450> can<00:03:20.630> solve<00:03:20.870> it<00:03:21.079> in<00:03:21.200> about

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:21.380 
get normally we can solve it in about

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:23.650 
get normally we can solve it in about
three<00:03:21.440> minutes<00:03:22.040> with<00:03:22.250> a<00:03:22.280> quarterback<00:03:22.670> just

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:23.660 
three minutes with a quarterback just

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:26.199 
three minutes with a quarterback just
have<00:03:23.870> somebody<00:03:24.200> stand<00:03:24.859> right<00:03:25.549> up<00:03:25.700> next<00:03:25.940> to

00:03:26.199 --> 00:03:26.209 
have somebody stand right up next to

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:28.240 
have somebody stand right up next to
them<00:03:26.389> so<00:03:26.959> that<00:03:27.170> they<00:03:27.290> have<00:03:27.530> to<00:03:27.709> keep<00:03:27.859> the<00:03:28.069> ball

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:28.250 
them so that they have to keep the ball

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:31.569 
them so that they have to keep the ball
here<00:03:28.760> and<00:03:29.090> when<00:03:29.660> they<00:03:29.780> finish<00:03:30.109> that<00:03:30.319> throw<00:03:30.680> I

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:31.579 
here and when they finish that throw I

00:03:31.579 --> 00:03:34.089 
here and when they finish that throw I
think<00:03:32.359> you<00:03:32.480> can<00:03:32.660> solve<00:03:32.870> that<00:03:33.019> problem<00:03:33.170> now<00:03:34.069> I

a punch I'm here this elbow works down
at<00:04:02.810> my<00:04:02.959> side<00:04:03.290> and<00:04:03.620> it<00:04:04.579> looks<00:04:04.819> a<00:04:04.970> little<00:04:05.090> bit

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:05.329 
at my side and it looks a little bit

00:04:05.329 --> 00:04:08.530 
at my side and it looks a little bit
like<00:04:05.599> a<00:04:05.630> ferris<00:04:06.139> wheel<00:04:06.519> but<00:04:07.519> this<00:04:07.940> is<00:04:08.180> the<00:04:08.329> part

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:08.540 
like a ferris wheel but this is the part

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:10.589 
like a ferris wheel but this is the part
that<00:04:08.870> determines<00:04:09.470> the<00:04:09.680> spin<00:04:10.190> of<00:04:10.340> the<00:04:10.370> ball

00:04:10.589 --> 00:04:10.599 
that determines the spin of the ball

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:14.530 
that determines the spin of the ball
don't<00:04:11.599> get<00:04:11.840> it<00:04:11.959> under<00:04:12.200> here<00:04:12.440> keep<00:04:12.739> it<00:04:12.919> flat<00:04:13.540> see

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:14.540 
don't get it under here keep it flat see

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:16.959 
don't get it under here keep it flat see
you<00:04:14.630> next<00:04:14.870> time
