00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:10.130 

I<00:00:07.220> think<00:00:08.220> the<00:00:08.400> most<00:00:08.660> overwhelming<00:00:09.660> problem

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:10.140 
I think the most overwhelming problem

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:11.570 
I think the most overwhelming problem
that<00:00:10.320> we've<00:00:10.470> got<00:00:10.710> at<00:00:10.860> the<00:00:10.980> moment

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
that we've got at the moment

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:13.970 
that we've got at the moment
as<00:00:11.639> far<00:00:12.090> as<00:00:12.120> medical<00:00:12.780> problems

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
as far as medical problems

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.359 
as far as medical problems
is<00:00:14.340> the<00:00:15.090> problem<00:00:15.330> of<00:00:15.719> upper<00:00:16.110> respiratory

00:00:16.359 --> 00:00:16.369 
is the problem of upper respiratory

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:19.880 
is the problem of upper respiratory
infections<00:00:17.369> in<00:00:17.610> cats<00:00:18.050> this<00:00:19.050> seems<00:00:19.410> to<00:00:19.710> be

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
infections in cats this seems to be

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.429 
infections in cats this seems to be
something<00:00:20.400> that<00:00:20.640> is<00:00:21.029> so<00:00:21.060> common<00:00:21.930> especially

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
something that is so common especially

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.480 
something that is so common especially
in<00:00:22.830> shelters<00:00:23.790> in<00:00:24.060> the<00:00:24.210> US<00:00:24.570> I<00:00:25.189> designed<00:00:26.189> a

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
in shelters in the US I designed a

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.630 
in shelters in the US I designed a
clinical<00:00:26.939> trial<00:00:27.240> where<00:00:28.050> we<00:00:28.640> randomly

treatment was doxycycline which was the

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:35.120 
treatment was doxycycline which was the
cheapest<00:01:31.520> antibiotic<00:01:32.520> as<00:01:32.700> well<00:01:34.130> clinically

the absence of microbial results I think

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:26.089 
the absence of microbial results I think

I would go with doxycycline I'd like to

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:27.260 
I would go with doxycycline I'd like to
point<00:02:26.310> out<00:02:26.579> that

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:27.270 
point out that

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:31.340 
point out that
in<00:02:27.360> our<00:02:27.510> study<00:02:27.930> using<00:02:28.800> doxycycline<00:02:29.900> we<00:02:30.900> made

in our study using doxycycline we made

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:33.980 
in our study using doxycycline we made
sure<00:02:31.380> that<00:02:32.040> we<00:02:32.190> always<00:02:32.490> used<00:02:33.360> liquid

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:33.990 
sure that we always used liquid

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:37.400 
sure that we always used liquid
doxycycline<00:02:34.890> and<00:02:35.670> this<00:02:36.390> is<00:02:36.630> because<00:02:37.140> there

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
doxycycline and this is because there

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:40.220 
doxycycline and this is because there
has<00:02:37.620> been<00:02:37.650> reported<00:02:38.520> some<00:02:38.960> reactions<00:02:39.960> where

there can be esophageal damage from
ulceration<00:02:43.680> if<00:02:43.860> you<00:02:44.490> use<00:02:44.880> doxycycline

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.010 
ulceration if you use doxycycline

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:50.000 
ulceration if you use doxycycline
tablets<00:02:47.010> and<00:02:47.870> even<00:02:48.870> if<00:02:49.050> you<00:02:49.200> use<00:02:49.440> doxycycline

in<00:02:50.850> gel<00:02:51.210> caps<00:02:51.570> it's<00:02:51.870> really<00:02:52.260> much<00:02:52.530> better<00:02:52.890> to

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:53.820 
in gel caps it's really much better to

yielded<00:03:11.370> some<00:03:11.640> very<00:03:11.970> interesting<00:03:12.690> results

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 
yielded some very interesting results

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.430 
yielded some very interesting results

into<00:03:32.250> the<00:03:32.460> shelter<00:03:33.590> we<00:03:34.590> would<00:03:34.830> have<00:03:34.950> I<00:03:35.100> able<00:03:35.400> to

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:35.550 
into the shelter we would have I able to

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:37.850 
into the shelter we would have I able to
divide<00:03:36.090> those<00:03:36.600> puppies<00:03:37.080> and<00:03:37.230> kittens<00:03:37.470> into

two groups one group received antibiotic

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:45.170 
two groups one group received antibiotic
treatment<00:03:43.200> within<00:03:43.380> 24<00:03:44.220> hours<00:03:44.490> of<00:03:44.970> their

treatment within 24 hours of their

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:47.810 
treatment within 24 hours of their
arrival<00:03:45.780> at<00:03:45.960> the<00:03:46.200> shelter<00:03:46.620> and<00:03:46.860> the<00:03:47.640> other

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:47.820 
arrival at the shelter and the other

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:50.930 
arrival at the shelter and the other
group<00:03:48.440> received<00:03:49.440> antibiotic<00:03:50.250> treatment<00:03:50.700> some

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:50.940 
group received antibiotic treatment some

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:55.580 
group received antibiotic treatment some
time<00:03:51.210> later<00:03:51.950> what<00:03:52.950> we<00:03:53.130> found<00:03:53.400> was<00:03:53.880> that<00:03:54.590> the

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:55.590 
time later what we found was that the

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:58.190 
time later what we found was that the
group<00:03:56.070> that<00:03:56.280> received<00:03:56.690> antibiotic<00:03:57.690> treatment

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:58.200 
group that received antibiotic treatment

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:00.740 
group that received antibiotic treatment
immediately<00:03:59.100> on<00:03:59.370> entry<00:03:59.880> into<00:04:00.210> the<00:04:00.300> shelter

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:00.750 
immediately on entry into the shelter

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:04.040 
immediately on entry into the shelter
when<00:04:00.990> they<00:04:01.170> had<00:04:01.470> signs<00:04:01.920> of<00:04:02.370> respiratory<00:04:03.210> and

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:04.050 
when they had signs of respiratory and

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:09.520 
when they had signs of respiratory and
or<00:04:04.530> ocular<00:04:05.340> infection<00:04:06.200> they<00:04:07.610> went<00:04:08.610> on<00:04:08.940> to

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:09.530 
or ocular infection they went on to

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:12.770 
or ocular infection they went on to
recover<00:04:10.530> much<00:04:11.160> more<00:04:11.520> quickly<00:04:11.850> than<00:04:12.390> the<00:04:12.510> group

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:12.780 
recover much more quickly than the group

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:16.039 
recover much more quickly than the group
that<00:04:12.920> had<00:04:13.920> antibiotic<00:04:14.760> treatment<00:04:15.270> later<00:04:15.660> on

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:16.049 
that had antibiotic treatment later on

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:19.880 
that had antibiotic treatment later on
so<00:04:16.890> it<00:04:17.310> looks<00:04:17.580> like<00:04:17.910> it's<00:04:18.660> a<00:04:18.930> good<00:04:19.109> idea<00:04:19.320> if

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:19.890 
so it looks like it's a good idea if

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:22.850 
so it looks like it's a good idea if
they've<00:04:20.160> got<00:04:20.430> signs<00:04:20.850> of<00:04:21.270> respiratory<00:04:21.930> and/or

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:26.010 
ocular disease on intake treat them

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:28.160 
ocular disease on intake treat them
promptly<00:04:26.280> treat<00:04:27.060> them<00:04:27.240> within<00:04:27.570> 24<00:04:28.140> hours

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:28.170 
promptly treat them within 24 hours

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:31.780 
promptly treat them within 24 hours
