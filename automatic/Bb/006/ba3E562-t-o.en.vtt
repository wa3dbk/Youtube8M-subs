00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 
blue raspberry yeah I don't think

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:48.509 
blue raspberry yeah I don't think
there's<00:02:47.709> such<00:02:47.829> thing<00:02:47.859> as<00:02:48.099> a<00:02:48.159> blue<00:02:48.340> raspberry

00:02:48.509 --> 00:02:48.519 
there's such thing as a blue raspberry

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:51.990 
there's such thing as a blue raspberry
so<00:02:49.500> yeah<00:02:50.500> but<00:02:50.709> everybody<00:02:50.940> implements<00:02:51.940> that

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.000 
so yeah but everybody implements that

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.899 
so yeah but everybody implements that
flavor<00:02:52.329> like<00:02:53.170> blow<00:02:53.440> pop<00:02:53.650> implements<00:02:54.609> will<00:02:54.790> be

00:02:54.899 --> 00:02:54.909 
flavor like blow pop implements will be

00:02:54.909 --> 00:02:59.940 
flavor like blow pop implements will be
right<00:02:55.060> in<00:02:55.090> code<00:02:55.299> now<00:02:55.480> yes<00:02:56.049> I<00:02:58.019> will<00:02:59.019> be<00:02:59.200> known<00:02:59.769> I

00:02:59.940 --> 00:02:59.950 
right in code now yes I will be known I

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:01.770 
right in code now yes I will be known I
can<00:03:00.159> yeah<00:03:01.030> this<00:03:01.329> should<00:03:01.480> be<00:03:01.599> interesting

bit<00:03:09.849> stream<00:03:10.120> TV<00:03:10.359> people<00:03:11.260> may<00:03:11.500> have<00:03:11.530> noticed<00:03:11.980> if

00:03:12.089 --> 00:03:12.099 
bit stream TV people may have noticed if

00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:14.490 
bit stream TV people may have noticed if
they've<00:03:12.250> been<00:03:12.400> to<00:03:12.489> the<00:03:12.609> site<00:03:13.379> although<00:03:14.379> I

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:14.500 
they've been to the site although I

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:16.259 
they've been to the site although I
should<00:03:14.769> put<00:03:14.889> a<00:03:14.950> bit<00:03:15.190> stream<00:03:15.400> TV<00:03:15.609> at<00:03:15.790> the<00:03:15.879> bottom

00:03:16.259 --> 00:03:16.269 
should put a bit stream TV at the bottom

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:20.339 
should put a bit stream TV at the bottom
I<00:03:16.419> just<00:03:16.720> don't<00:03:18.540> being<00:03:19.540> at<00:03:19.750> the<00:03:19.870> finish<00:03:20.169> where

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:40.930 
can remember how to write C object

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:43.050 
can remember how to write C object
oriented<00:03:41.230> type<00:03:41.410> stuff<00:03:41.669> because<00:03:42.669> I<00:03:42.790> really

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:43.060 
oriented type stuff because I really

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:44.640 
oriented type stuff because I really
should<00:03:43.269> like<00:03:43.449> coding<00:03:43.810> and<00:03:44.019> I<00:03:44.109> always<00:03:44.260> try<00:03:44.379> it

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:44.650 
should like coding and I always try it

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:46.710 
should like coding and I always try it
but<00:03:45.190> I<00:03:45.220> never<00:03:45.340> do<00:03:45.699> where<00:03:45.970> you<00:03:46.209> should<00:03:46.510> like

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:46.720 
but I never do where you should like

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:48.599 
but I never do where you should like
coding<00:03:47.109> cuz<00:03:47.379> I'm<00:03:47.560> very<00:03:47.799> logical<00:03:48.310> and<00:03:48.370> I'm<00:03:48.489> very

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:48.609 
coding cuz I'm very logical and I'm very

00:03:48.609 --> 00:03:50.069

left<00:03:48.940> brained<00:03:49.180> that<00:03:49.569> one<00:03:49.690> came<00:03:49.840> out<00:03:49.959> better

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:50.079 
left brained that one came out better

00:03:50.079 --> 00:03:52.050

than<00:03:50.290> the<00:03:50.410> mosquito<00:03:50.859> victories<00:03:51.310> that's<00:03:51.910> why

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:52.060 
than the mosquito victories that's why

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:54.330 
than the mosquito victories that's why
I'm<00:03:52.180> take<00:03:52.629> that's<00:03:53.109> true<00:03:53.319> huh<00:03:53.440> the<00:03:53.980> one<00:03:54.099> we<00:03:54.220> did

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:54.340 
I'm take that's true huh the one we did

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:56.039 
I'm take that's true huh the one we did
in<00:03:54.489> the<00:03:54.549> picture<00:03:54.879> is<00:03:54.909> not<00:03:55.000> nearly<00:03:55.480> as<00:03:55.599> cool<00:03:55.870> as

00:03:56.039 --> 00:03:56.049 
in the picture is not nearly as cool as

00:03:56.049 --> 00:03:57.899 
in the picture is not nearly as cool as
this<00:03:56.169> one<00:03:56.379> layered<00:03:56.889> shots<00:03:57.190> do<00:03:57.489> that<00:03:57.669> to<00:03:57.790> you

00:03:57.899 --> 00:03:57.909 
this one layered shots do that to you

00:03:57.909 --> 00:03:59.309 
this one layered shots do that to you
sometimes<00:03:58.299> they<00:03:58.510> some<00:03:58.900> of<00:03:58.930> them<00:03:59.079> come<00:03:59.169> out

00:03:59.309 --> 00:03:59.319 
sometimes they some of them come out

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:00.629 
sometimes they some of them come out
better<00:03:59.470> than<00:03:59.620> others<00:03:59.769> this<00:03:59.980> is<00:04:00.040> a<00:04:00.159> perfect

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:00.639 
better than others this is a perfect

00:04:00.639 --> 00:04:03.930 
better than others this is a perfect
layer<00:04:01.169> you<00:04:02.169> see<00:04:02.319> my<00:04:02.470> kid<00:04:02.620> get<00:04:03.190> a<00:04:03.220> zoom<00:04:03.519> in<00:04:03.699> for

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:03.940 
layer you see my kid get a zoom in for

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:09.719 
layer you see my kid get a zoom in for
you<00:04:04.000> that's<00:04:04.810> the<00:04:05.560> shooter<00:04:05.980> I<00:04:06.720> think<00:04:08.400> the<00:04:09.400> trick

00:04:09.719 --> 00:04:09.729 
you that's the shooter I think the trick

00:04:09.729 --> 00:04:13.259 
you that's the shooter I think the trick
with<00:04:09.970> this<00:04:10.180> that<00:04:11.169> is<00:04:11.409> a<00:04:11.709> guy<00:04:12.519> call<00:04:12.790> you<00:04:12.909> to<00:04:13.060> say

for you one bro huh you might have

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:16.920 
for you one bro huh you might have
shaken<00:04:15.729> it<00:04:15.819> when<00:04:15.940> you<00:04:16.060> walked<00:04:16.269> that's<00:04:16.690> true

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:16.930 
shaken it when you walked that's true

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:18.509 
shaken it when you walked that's true
there<00:04:17.500> was<00:04:17.620> a<00:04:17.650> little<00:04:17.889> shake<00:04:18.039> because<00:04:18.190> I<00:04:18.340> made
