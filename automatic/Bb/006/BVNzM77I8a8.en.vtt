00:00:16.699 --> 00:00:20.960
 yes yes yes yes yes the deepest of my heart insisted that if you want 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:21.789
 hide it 

00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:24.789
 the peace and tranquility that chose so much rubalcaba 

00:00:26.419 --> 00:00:29.929
 the view put in which all the people who want to be present 

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:31.050
 interrupt 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.750
 or is that they can not understand why I do it because it is my desire to move away from 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:37.870
 what are you doing here 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:39.540
 and meat 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.380
 we 

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:45.380
 no more crimes 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:03.250
 but in between a lot 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.350
 we must see 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:07.730
 in 2008 

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:10.760
 in the January edition of this year 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:13.760
 the world Cup 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:38.940
 after 

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:42.620
 the thread 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:46.130
 the navigator 

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:53.770
 final 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:55.110
 the corpse 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.110
 m 

00:02:14.049 --> 00:02:16.109
 they are victims 

00:02:16.109 --> 00:02:18.279
 to those who leave the earth 

00:02:18.279 --> 00:02:21.649
 they have always been present in my heart since I arrived on this planet 

00:02:21.649 --> 00:02:24.459
 called buried 

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:26.339
 400 years ago 

00:02:26.339 --> 00:02:29.259
 I just want to see you again one more time 

00:02:29.259 --> 00:02:30.579
 and you 

00:02:30.579 --> 00:02:33.579
 diplomatic I can not understand what that class is 

00:02:34.279 --> 00:02:37.599
 do not lie to us this is the justification for your acts of violence 

00:02:38.689 --> 00:02:41.689
 activated defenses 

00:02:44.249 --> 00:02:48.609
 that barrier is impenetrable the plasma energy now you protect me you 

00:02:48.609 --> 00:02:52.169
 they never had laws so that what the final dream should have allowed me to 

00:02:52.169 --> 00:02:55.279
 will move forever 

00:02:55.279 --> 00:02:57.100
 Now it's too late 

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:01.370
 this sky the graphics does not show us what happens in our true sky 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:07.120
 however I know that in less than 58 minutes with 35 seconds we will have 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:08.959
 reached 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:12.389
 this will no longer be necessary when we get to that place 

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:18.569
 ortega dÃ­az rafa marcano so much that the boats of the cover I trust that my 

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:21.569
 system will keep active as necessary 

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:24.710
 and when it seemed that they are not going to agree 

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:27.710
 stop 

00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:50.149
 Loreley the doctor that he has managed to access the archives of Mesopotamia 

00:03:50.149 --> 00:03:54.769
 has made contact with the data bank and started copying files of it if 

00:03:54.769 --> 00:03:57.019
 what he says can not be 

00:03:57.019 --> 00:04:00.430
 the only way to achieve access to files of total sales with 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:01.609
 the help of money 

00:04:01.609 --> 00:04:04.609
 i look like 

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:11.699
 fox 

00:04:11.699 --> 00:04:14.449
 management of the archives of Mesopotamia 

00:04:14.449 --> 00:04:15.330
 so is 

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:18.790
 so we have managed to extract the data so that the women of kusa year 

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:20.200
 so that's it 

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:23.660
 that's why I wanted to go out and stay longer and if it's a hole 

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:24.370
 worm 

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:28.060
 they are two women who meet in time and space looks like a tunnel to 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:29.330
 through the sky 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:32.390
 and so we break the barrier of the speed of light but it is not possible 

00:04:32.389 --> 00:04:36.199
 survive until the trip without protection all we know now is 

00:04:36.199 --> 00:04:39.699
 that through a wormhole came the first founders 

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:44.539
 but the coordinates of it were lost in the file those coordinates 

00:04:44.539 --> 00:04:46.169
 in your whore 

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:50.759
 they were the ones who could even and copied that means they would try to cross and 

00:04:50.759 --> 00:04:53.759
 that resemble those of the stars 

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:57.620
 dani alves this afternoon 

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:06.610
 now that we have finally found out 

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:09.610
 you can not do anything 

00:05:35.059 --> 00:05:37.120
 it's too promised 

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:41.610
 a real curse for me already enough we will not leave where all the 

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:42.800
 humanity heard 

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:47.080
 to achieve this lost dream caused outrages that accompanied the earth not 

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:51.180
 remember everything I did for you do not have the way humans do 

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:54.180
 they loaded the game and fell on them is just retribution 

00:05:54.999 --> 00:05:59.580
 two submarines do not learn from their past mistakes their desire to protect them 

00:05:59.579 --> 00:06:02.770
 it is a great weakness of the system 

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:05.389
 it's nothing new 

00:06:05.389 --> 00:06:08.289
 and it is not something ugly either 

00:06:08.289 --> 00:06:11.520
 it's already happened 

00:06:12.539 --> 00:06:13.660
 a big pain 

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:17.510
 having fun together with the others working at our side and every day 

00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:19.150
 we learn new things 

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:22.259
 because at his side we learn to believe 

00:06:22.259 --> 00:06:25.169
 human beings are not loved ones 

00:06:25.169 --> 00:06:28.169
 stop 

00:06:30.999 --> 00:06:35.659
 you are very wrong you are never seen as if you were human beings 

00:06:36.659 --> 00:06:41.259
 I know very well why it happened to him and that's why you and I are so 

00:06:41.259 --> 00:06:42.869
 Similar 

00:06:42.869 --> 00:06:45.400
 those words are of permanence 

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:48.400
 now you feel like human beings 

00:06:49.169 --> 00:06:52.389
 they can call their bodies human beings their DNA 

00:06:52.389 --> 00:06:54.949
 the premise choice 

00:06:54.949 --> 00:06:59.770
 and we do not need your help to feel like real humans 

00:06:59.770 --> 00:07:01.649
 because what's important 

00:07:01.649 --> 00:07:05.559
 our bodies are not our bodies that will never be flesh and blood 

00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:11.229
 if not our heart because our heart allows us to believe and feel 

00:07:11.229 --> 00:07:14.110
 happy to call people to a clear 

00:07:14.110 --> 00:07:17.629
 in our hearts they are a week before what we should see 

00:07:17.629 --> 00:07:20.629
 it is necessary for the human being 

00:07:21.379 --> 00:07:22.569
 so solon 

00:07:22.569 --> 00:07:25.569
 some english puppets 

00:07:44.469 --> 00:07:48.419
 destroy hassan we all end up developing links two bombs 

00:08:03.919 --> 00:08:06.050
 I do not know to what company adn 

00:08:06.050 --> 00:08:09.059
 been totally drunk 

00:08:09.059 --> 00:08:09.739
