welcome<00:00:05.980> to<00:00:06.130> the<00:00:06.220> necklace<00:00:06.580> 11<00:00:06.910> x12

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:07.270 
welcome to the necklace 11 x12

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:09.120 
welcome to the necklace 11 x12
technology<00:00:07.870> today<00:00:08.200> I'd<00:00:08.380> like<00:00:08.530> to<00:00:08.650> compare<00:00:08.950> the

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:09.130 
technology today I'd like to compare the

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:13.830 
technology today I'd like to compare the
Intel<00:00:09.550> i7<00:00:10.230> 4790k<00:00:11.230> with<00:00:11.740> the<00:00:11.860> AMD<00:00:12.340> FX<00:00:12.490> 95<00:00:13.180> 90<00:00:13.660> and

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:13.840 
Intel i7 4790k with the AMD FX 95 90 and

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:17.460 
Intel i7 4790k with the AMD FX 95 90 and
FX<00:00:14.559> 8350<00:00:15.309> processors<00:00:16.120> without<00:00:16.810> further<00:00:17.080> ado

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:17.470 
FX 8350 processors without further ado

00:00:17.470 --> 00:01:09.080 
FX 8350 processors without further ado
let's<00:00:18.160> jump<00:00:18.460> into<00:00:18.700> the<00:00:18.910> benchmarks

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.859 

as<00:01:09.979> you<00:01:10.979> saw<00:01:11.280> yourself<00:01:11.790> there's<00:01:12.149> a<00:01:12.210> pretty<00:01:12.600> big

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
as you saw yourself there's a pretty big

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:13.990 
as you saw yourself there's a pretty big
difference<00:01:13.049> between<00:01:13.439> these<00:01:13.860> three

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:14.000 
difference between these three

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.700 
difference between these three
processors<00:01:15.000> all<00:01:15.210> of<00:01:15.750> them<00:01:15.930> are<00:01:16.170> good<00:01:16.409> that's

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
processors all of them are good that's

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.480 
processors all of them are good that's
for<00:01:16.950> sure<00:01:17.189> the<00:01:17.700> i7<00:01:18.240> 4790k<00:01:19.079> is<00:01:19.560> a<00:01:19.619> clear<00:01:20.189> winner

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
for sure the i7 4790k is a clear winner

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.580 
for sure the i7 4790k is a clear winner
though<00:01:20.789> especially<00:01:21.270> at<00:01:21.750> rendering<00:01:22.170> but<00:01:22.409> also

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
though especially at rendering but also

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.679 
though especially at rendering but also
gaming<00:01:23.130> in<00:01:23.579> this<00:01:23.880> affects<00:01:24.299> ninety<00:01:24.539> five

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
gaming in this affects ninety five

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:28.100 
gaming in this affects ninety five
ninety<00:01:24.750> and<00:01:25.229> FX<00:01:25.560> 8350<00:01:26.340> CPUs<00:01:27.110> unfortunately

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
ninety and FX 8350 CPUs unfortunately

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.800 
ninety and FX 8350 CPUs unfortunately
fall<00:01:28.409> back<00:01:28.740> behind<00:01:28.979> that<00:01:29.310> i7<00:01:29.909> CPU<00:01:30.299> but<00:01:30.720> you

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
fall back behind that i7 CPU but you

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.109 
fall back behind that i7 CPU but you
also<00:01:30.929> have<00:01:31.229> to<00:01:31.380> keep<00:01:31.530> in<00:01:31.710> mind<00:01:31.920> the<00:01:32.100> price<00:01:32.280> both

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
also have to keep in mind the price both

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:36.669 
also have to keep in mind the price both
AMD<00:01:33.659> CPUs<00:01:34.140> cost<00:01:34.439> less<00:01:34.740> than<00:01:34.950> the<00:01:35.009> i7<00:01:35.549> 4790k

00:01:36.669 --> 00:01:36.679 
AMD CPUs cost less than the i7 4790k

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:40.580 
AMD CPUs cost less than the i7 4790k
especially<00:01:37.679> the<00:01:37.799> FX<00:01:38.220> 8350<00:01:39.049> really<00:01:40.049> performs

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
especially the FX 8350 really performs

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.550 
especially the FX 8350 really performs
for<00:01:40.829> its<00:01:40.950> price<00:01:41.190> in<00:01:41.580> my<00:01:42.060> opinion<00:01:42.479> the<00:01:42.569> FX<00:01:42.869> 8350

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
for its price in my opinion the FX 8350

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.070 
for its price in my opinion the FX 8350
has<00:01:43.950> the<00:01:44.130> best<00:01:44.429> price<00:01:44.819> performance<00:01:45.090> ratio<00:01:45.539> of

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:46.080 
has the best price performance ratio of

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:48.919 
has the best price performance ratio of
these<00:01:46.560> three<00:01:46.950> CPUs<00:01:47.429> I've<00:01:47.610> shown<00:01:47.850> you<00:01:47.929> however

00:01:48.919 --> 00:01:48.929 
these three CPUs I've shown you however

00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:51.859 
these three CPUs I've shown you however
when<00:01:49.500> it<00:01:49.619> comes<00:01:49.799> to<00:01:49.979> raw<00:01:50.189> performance<00:01:50.429> the<00:01:51.299> i7

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
when it comes to raw performance the i7

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.889 
when it comes to raw performance the i7
4790k<00:01:52.649> is<00:01:53.130> the<00:01:53.490> clear<00:01:53.759> winner<00:01:54.090> in<00:01:54.330> the<00:01:54.840> end

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
4790k is the clear winner in the end

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:57.559 
4790k is the clear winner in the end
it's<00:01:55.409> your<00:01:55.799> choice<00:01:56.039> not<00:01:56.340> mine<00:01:56.399> you<00:01:57.270> decide

00:01:57.559 --> 00:01:57.569 
it's your choice not mine you decide

00:01:57.569 --> 00:01:59.419 
it's your choice not mine you decide
which<00:01:57.810> one's<00:01:58.080> the<00:01:58.259> winner<00:01:58.409> I<00:01:58.799> hope<00:01:59.130> I<00:01:59.250> could

00:01:59.419 --> 00:01:59.429 
which one's the winner I hope I could

00:01:59.429 --> 00:02:01.219 
which one's the winner I hope I could
help<00:01:59.610> you<00:01:59.729> out<00:01:59.789> with<00:02:00.090> your<00:02:00.330> decision<00:02:00.869> somehow
