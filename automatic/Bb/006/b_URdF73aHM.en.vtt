why is because some phones will save
information<00:02:13.730> to<00:02:14.270> the<00:02:14.420> phone<00:02:14.630> itself<00:02:15.110> and<00:02:15.470> then

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:15.860 
information to the phone itself and then

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:17.650 
information to the phone itself and then
other<00:02:16.069> information<00:02:16.790> will<00:02:17.000> be<00:02:17.120> saved<00:02:17.330> to<00:02:17.480> the

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:17.660 
other information will be saved to the

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:20.170 
other information will be saved to the
SIM<00:02:17.930> card<00:02:17.959> so<00:02:18.470> your<00:02:18.590> best<00:02:18.830> bet<00:02:19.040> is<00:02:19.400> to<00:02:19.459> go<00:02:20.060> ahead

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180 
SIM card so your best bet is to go ahead

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:21.850 
SIM card so your best bet is to go ahead
and<00:02:20.569> just<00:02:20.690> take<00:02:20.930> that<00:02:21.110> SIM<00:02:21.410> card<00:02:21.680> out<00:02:21.830> to

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:21.860 
and just take that SIM card out to

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:24.309 
and just take that SIM card out to
ensure<00:02:22.220> that<00:02:22.459> all<00:02:22.760> your<00:02:22.790> contacts<00:02:23.510> are<00:02:23.810> off
