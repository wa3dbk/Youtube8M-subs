which is a pretty fair deal for a
high-end<00:01:34.740> speedo<00:01:36.259> well<00:01:37.259> even<00:01:37.590> if<00:01:37.680> you<00:01:37.770> get<00:01:37.890> the

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
high-end speedo well even if you get the

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:39.590 
high-end speedo well even if you get the
cellophane<00:01:38.310> off<00:01:38.460> there's<00:01:38.820> still<00:01:39.119> a<00:01:39.360> little

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
cellophane off there's still a little

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.800 
cellophane off there's still a little
seal<00:01:39.869> on<00:01:40.020> here<00:01:40.200> so<00:01:40.380> we'll<00:01:40.500> cut<00:01:40.680> that<00:01:41.329> and<00:01:42.329> let's

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
seal on here so we'll cut that and let's

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.249 
seal on here so we'll cut that and let's
see<00:01:42.899> what<00:01:42.990> you<00:01:43.049> get<00:01:43.110> in<00:01:43.200> the<00:01:43.259> box<00:01:44.930> so<00:01:45.930> you<00:01:45.960> saw

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
see what you get in the box so you saw

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:49.130 
see what you get in the box so you saw
before<00:01:46.619> I<00:01:46.649> did<00:01:46.920> what's<00:01:47.100> in<00:01:47.250> there<00:01:48.140> nothing

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
before I did what's in there nothing

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.730 
before I did what's in there nothing
another<00:01:49.380> box<00:01:50.509> fail<00:01:51.509> so<00:01:52.350> there's<00:01:52.470> a<00:01:52.530> piece<00:01:52.710> of

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
foam I guess I'll just pull this up so

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:56.840 
foam I guess I'll just pull this up so
we<00:01:55.350> both<00:01:55.590> see<00:01:55.770> right<00:01:55.950> so<00:01:56.490> there's<00:01:56.610> a<00:01:56.670> piece<00:01:56.820> of

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
we both see right so there's a piece of

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.810 
we both see right so there's a piece of
foam<00:01:57.500> looks<00:01:58.500> like<00:01:58.649> instruction<00:01:59.460> booklet

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
foam looks like instruction booklet

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:04.870 
foam looks like instruction booklet
instruction<00:02:00.509> manual<00:02:02.329> some<00:02:03.329> what<00:02:04.290> is<00:02:04.439> this<00:02:04.649> oh

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:04.880 
instruction manual some what is this oh

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.039 
instruction manual some what is this oh
so<00:02:05.880> you<00:02:05.969> can<00:02:06.090> download<00:02:06.240> some<00:02:06.540> software<00:02:06.570> or

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
so you can download some software or

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:09.469 
so you can download some software or
something<00:02:07.320> like<00:02:07.409> that<00:02:07.649> and<00:02:08.060> then<00:02:09.060> there's<00:02:09.330> the

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:30.640 
my hands are kind of in the way let me

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:31.530 
my hands are kind of in the way let me
see<00:02:30.760> if<00:02:30.820> I<00:02:30.880> can<00:02:30.970> come<00:02:31.060> over<00:02:31.180> here<00:02:31.270> maybe<00:02:31.480> you

like the idea well let's get some type
of<00:02:42.550> an<00:02:42.670> adapter<00:02:43.090> here<00:02:43.270> don't<00:02:43.630> know<00:02:43.750> I've<00:02:43.900> never

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:49.050 
a learning experience for me but uh

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:54.290 
a learning experience for me but uh
we'll<00:02:50.050> just<00:02:50.260> take<00:02:50.410> this<00:02:50.500> out<00:02:50.680> of<00:02:50.710> here<00:02:51.360> and<00:02:52.360> see

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:54.300 
we'll just take this out of here and see

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:57.900 
we'll just take this out of here and see
it's<00:02:55.300> starting<00:02:55.630> to<00:02:55.690> come<00:02:55.750> out<00:02:56.790> all<00:02:57.790> right

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:57.910 
it's starting to come out all right

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:00.270 
it's starting to come out all right
there<00:02:58.090> we<00:02:58.180> go<00:02:58.380> so<00:02:59.380> there<00:02:59.560> is<00:02:59.740> the<00:02:59.950> actual

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:00.280 
there we go so there is the actual

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.640 
there we go so there is the actual
speedo<00:03:00.520> itself<00:03:00.880> thing<00:03:01.870> is<00:03:01.990> really<00:03:02.290> pretty<00:03:02.530> I

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:02.650 
speedo itself thing is really pretty I

mean it's a really nice speedo and one
of<00:03:04.990> the<00:03:05.050> reasons<00:03:05.320> I<00:03:05.410> really<00:03:05.740> wanted<00:03:06.370> an<00:03:06.550> Orion

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:07.000 
of the reasons I really wanted an Orion

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.420 
of the reasons I really wanted an Orion
is<00:03:07.180> for<00:03:07.390> this<00:03:07.600> one<00:03:08.140> you<00:03:08.920> can<00:03:09.070> see<00:03:09.220> that<00:03:09.340> it's

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:09.430 
is for this one you can see that it's

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:10.500 
is for this one you can see that it's
got<00:03:09.520> a<00:03:09.580> sensor<00:03:09.940> port<00:03:10.120> right<00:03:10.240> there<00:03:10.360> in<00:03:10.420> the

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:10.510 
got a sensor port right there in the

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:12.360 
got a sensor port right there in the
back<00:03:10.660> but<00:03:11.320> it<00:03:11.380> has<00:03:11.560> another<00:03:11.800> sensor<00:03:12.160> port

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:12.370 
back but it has another sensor port

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:15.000 
back but it has another sensor port
right<00:03:12.550> here<00:03:12.580> on<00:03:12.910> the<00:03:13.060> top<00:03:13.270> so<00:03:13.690> there's<00:03:14.500> nothing

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:15.010 
right here on the top so there's nothing

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:17.570 
right here on the top so there's nothing
worse<00:03:15.190> than<00:03:15.220> plugging<00:03:16.000> in<00:03:16.180> a<00:03:16.390> sensor<00:03:16.810> wire

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:17.580 
worse than plugging in a sensor wire

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:19.560 
worse than plugging in a sensor wire
getting<00:03:18.580> all<00:03:18.670> your<00:03:18.790> electronics<00:03:19.209> mounted

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:19.570 
getting all your electronics mounted

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:21.870

having somebody plow into you from the
back<00:03:22.120> and<00:03:22.480> hit<00:03:22.959> your<00:03:23.110> motor<00:03:23.320> or<00:03:23.440> rip<00:03:23.680> your

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:23.830 
back and hit your motor or rip your

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:25.890 
back and hit your motor or rip your
sensor<00:03:24.100> wire<00:03:24.250> and<00:03:24.520> then<00:03:25.060> having<00:03:25.270> to<00:03:25.480> take<00:03:25.690> the

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:25.900 
sensor wire and then having to take the

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:27.510 
sensor wire and then having to take the
speed<00:03:26.110> control<00:03:26.410> out<00:03:26.620> just<00:03:27.070> to<00:03:27.160> change<00:03:27.400> the

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:27.520 
speed control out just to change the

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:30.330 
speed control out just to change the
sensor<00:03:27.910> wire<00:03:28.060> so<00:03:28.390> I<00:03:28.740> think<00:03:29.740> it's<00:03:29.830> really<00:03:30.130> cool

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:30.340 
sensor wire so I think it's really cool
