a review of the FQ 777 RC flying bubble

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.640 
a review of the FQ 777 RC flying bubble
shark<00:00:17.330> this<00:00:18.330> is<00:00:18.480> basically<00:00:18.930> a<00:00:19.050> 3<00:00:19.380> channel

coaxial helicopter
with<00:00:21.689> a<00:00:21.720> body<00:00:22.230> of<00:00:22.349> a<00:00:22.560> shark<00:00:22.890> and<00:00:23.130> the<00:00:23.970> ability

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
with a body of a shark and the ability

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.340 
with a body of a shark and the ability
to<00:00:24.510> blow<00:00:25.140> bubbles<00:00:25.850> it<00:00:26.850> comes<00:00:27.150> with<00:00:27.480> the<00:00:27.750> bubble

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:28.350 
to blow bubbles it comes with the bubble

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:31.849 
to blow bubbles it comes with the bubble
water<00:00:28.560> here<00:00:29.160> which<00:00:30.090> it<00:00:30.300> says<00:00:30.660> let's<00:00:31.170> play<00:00:31.590> the

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
water here which it says let's play the

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:35.330 
water here which it says let's play the
bubbles<00:00:32.250> and<00:00:32.720> so<00:00:33.720> you<00:00:33.780> you<00:00:34.530> take<00:00:34.830> this<00:00:35.010> little

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
bubbles and so you you take this little

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.850 
bubbles and so you you take this little
tool<00:00:35.550> here<00:00:35.580> and<00:00:36.150> you<00:00:36.449> suck<00:00:36.750> out<00:00:36.900> the<00:00:37.230> bubble

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
tool here and you suck out the bubble

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.069 
tool here and you suck out the bubble
juice<00:00:38.129> and<00:00:38.550> then<00:00:39.239> there's<00:00:39.480> another<00:00:39.809> little

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
juice and then there's another little

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.440 
juice and then there's another little
tool<00:00:40.380> here<00:00:40.410> that<00:00:40.800> you<00:00:41.160> put<00:00:41.640> on<00:00:41.760> the<00:00:41.940> end<00:00:42.059> and

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
tool here that you put on the end and

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.930 
tool here that you put on the end and
then<00:00:43.320> there's<00:00:43.620> a<00:00:43.710> plug<00:00:44.100> on<00:00:44.340> the<00:00:44.489> side<00:00:44.730> of<00:00:44.760> the

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
then there's a plug on the side of the

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.090 
then there's a plug on the side of the
helicopter<00:00:45.600> here<00:00:45.870> that<00:00:46.110> you<00:00:46.230> can<00:00:46.530> you<00:00:46.829> pull

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
helicopter here that you can you pull

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.090 
helicopter here that you can you pull
that<00:00:47.250> plug<00:00:47.809> put<00:00:48.809> this<00:00:48.989> in<00:00:49.290> there<00:00:49.530> and<00:00:49.800> then<00:00:49.920> you

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
that plug put this in there and then you

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.860 
that plug put this in there and then you
there's<00:00:50.520> a<00:00:50.610> little<00:00:50.790> reservoir<00:00:51.000> that<00:00:51.570> you<00:00:51.629> fill

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
there's a little reservoir that you fill

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.410 
there's a little reservoir that you fill
up<00:00:52.050> with<00:00:52.260> the<00:00:52.379> bubble<00:00:52.680> water<00:00:52.829> and<00:00:53.219> then<00:00:54.059> from<00:00:54.329> a

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
up with the bubble water and then from a

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.310 
up with the bubble water and then from a
button<00:00:54.719> on<00:00:54.989> the<00:00:55.289> transmitter<00:00:55.760> it'll<00:00:57.320> start

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
button on the transmitter it'll start

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.500 
button on the transmitter it'll start
shooting<00:00:59.100> the<00:00:59.219> bubbles<00:00:59.520> out<00:00:59.670> of<00:00:59.730> the<00:00:59.879> nose

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
shooting the bubbles out of the nose

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.840 
shooting the bubbles out of the nose
here<00:01:00.930> so<00:01:01.170> that's<00:01:01.350> pretty<00:01:01.590> cool<00:01:01.800> and<00:01:02.129> it<00:01:02.699> also

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
here so that's pretty cool and it also

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.510 
here so that's pretty cool and it also
does<00:01:03.210> have<00:01:03.239> a<00:01:03.449> bright<00:01:03.840> LED<00:01:04.320> on<00:01:04.890> the<00:01:05.009> front<00:01:05.280> as

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:05.520 
does have a bright LED on the front as

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:11.090 
does have a bright LED on the front as
well<00:01:07.100> it<00:01:08.100> does<00:01:08.160> come<00:01:08.670> with<00:01:08.700> a<00:01:09.360> spare<00:01:10.350> tail<00:01:10.710> prop

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
well it does come with a spare tail prop

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.060 
well it does come with a spare tail prop
and<00:01:11.399> a<00:01:11.490> spare<00:01:11.760> set<00:01:12.060> of<00:01:12.090> rotors<00:01:12.600> and<00:01:13.140> the

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
and a spare set of rotors and the

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.300 
and a spare set of rotors and the
transmitter<00:01:14.670> is<00:01:14.970> a<00:01:15.270> little<00:01:15.770> different<00:01:16.770> it's

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
transmitter is a little different it's

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.760 
transmitter is a little different it's
kind<00:01:17.580> of<00:01:17.670> oddly<00:01:18.570> shaped<00:01:19.229> but<00:01:19.530> I<00:01:19.560> actually

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
kind of oddly shaped but I actually

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.100 
kind of oddly shaped but I actually
didn't<00:01:20.250> mine<00:01:20.460> the<00:01:20.760> shape<00:01:21.090> it<00:01:21.299> fits<00:01:21.600> well<00:01:21.869> in

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
didn't mine the shape it fits well in

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.039 
didn't mine the shape it fits well in
your<00:01:22.229> hands<00:01:22.799> but<00:01:23.520> it<00:01:23.790> has<00:01:24.030> these<00:01:24.360> big<00:01:24.750> dumb

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
your hands but it has these big dumb

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:28.700 
your hands but it has these big dumb
thumb<00:01:25.470> pads<00:01:25.770> that<00:01:26.430> you<00:01:26.490> can't<00:01:26.909> remove<00:01:27.270> so<00:01:27.869> it's

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
thumb pads that you can't remove so it's

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.070 
thumb pads that you can't remove so it's
not<00:01:28.950> exactly<00:01:29.430> great<00:01:29.670> for<00:01:30.030> pinching<00:01:30.509> I<00:01:30.659> tend<00:01:30.960> to

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:31.080 
not exactly great for pinching I tend to

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:32.840 
not exactly great for pinching I tend to
fly<00:01:31.290> it<00:01:31.350> with<00:01:31.560> my<00:01:31.710> thumbs<00:01:32.009> which<00:01:32.340> isn't<00:01:32.549> too

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
fly it with my thumbs which isn't too

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.539 
fly it with my thumbs which isn't too
bad<00:01:33.000> being<00:01:33.420> only<00:01:33.630> three<00:01:33.990> channels<00:01:34.549> it's

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
bad being only three channels it's

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.569 
bad being only three channels it's
pretty<00:01:35.880> easy<00:01:36.119> to<00:01:36.329> fly<00:01:36.630> with<00:01:36.810> just<00:01:36.840> your<00:01:37.140> thumbs

00:01:37.569 --> 00:01:37.579 
pretty easy to fly with just your thumbs

00:01:37.579 --> 00:01:39.770 
pretty easy to fly with just your thumbs
but<00:01:38.579> it's<00:01:38.729> this<00:01:38.880> nice<00:01:39.119> kind<00:01:39.509> of<00:01:39.600> like<00:01:39.750> a

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
but it's this nice kind of like a

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.990 
but it's this nice kind of like a
rubberized<00:01:40.409> plastic<00:01:40.710> it's<00:01:41.460> kind<00:01:41.700> of<00:01:41.759> a<00:01:41.820> little

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
rubberized plastic it's kind of a little

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.999 
rubberized plastic it's kind of a little
grippy<00:01:42.450> kind<00:01:42.750> of<00:01:42.810> has<00:01:42.960> like<00:01:42.990> a<00:01:43.140> suede<00:01:43.560> feel<00:01:43.950> to

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
grippy kind of has like a suede feel to

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.340 
grippy kind of has like a suede feel to
it<00:01:44.369> so<00:01:44.640> it<00:01:44.700> feels<00:01:45.030> nice<00:01:45.329> in<00:01:45.600> the<00:01:45.689> hands<00:01:46.170> and

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
it so it feels nice in the hands and

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.090 
it so it feels nice in the hands and
fits<00:01:47.130> well<00:01:47.540> it<00:01:48.540> does<00:01:48.750> have<00:01:48.990> a<00:01:49.020> demo<00:01:49.500> mode<00:01:49.740> which

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
fits well it does have a demo mode which

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.130 
fits well it does have a demo mode which
basically<00:01:50.610> you<00:01:51.090> know<00:01:51.210> just<00:01:51.390> makes<00:01:51.600> it<00:01:51.810> fly<00:01:52.110> a

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
basically you know just makes it fly a

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.080 
basically you know just makes it fly a
pre-programmed<00:01:52.860> route<00:01:53.490> and<00:01:53.759> you<00:01:53.880> just

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
pre-programmed route and you just

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.120 
pre-programmed route and you just
control<00:01:54.600> the<00:01:54.840> throttle<00:01:55.079> and<00:01:55.500> it<00:01:55.590> does<00:01:55.829> all<00:01:56.040> the

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
control the throttle and it does all the

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.760 
control the throttle and it does all the
right<00:01:56.340> stick<00:01:56.700> movements<00:01:56.970> for<00:01:57.420> you<00:01:57.630> it<00:01:58.619> has

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
right stick movements for you it has

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.710 
right stick movements for you it has
dual<00:01:59.070> rates<00:01:59.369> so<00:01:59.670> it<00:01:59.759> is<00:01:59.850> a<00:01:59.880> slow<00:02:00.240> and<00:02:00.390> a<00:02:00.479> fast

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:00.720 
dual rates so it is a slow and a fast

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:02.749 
dual rates so it is a slow and a fast
mode<00:02:01.020> just<00:02:01.320> for<00:02:01.590> forward<00:02:01.920> and<00:02:02.009> backwards<00:02:02.520> it

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
mode just for forward and backwards it

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:04.880 
mode just for forward and backwards it
doesn't<00:02:02.790> affect<00:02:03.420> how<00:02:03.570> fast<00:02:03.600> it<00:02:04.079> turns<00:02:04.380> and

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
doesn't affect how fast it turns and

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.330 
doesn't affect how fast it turns and
then<00:02:05.759> your<00:02:06.030> button<00:02:06.420> for<00:02:06.630> bubbles<00:02:07.070> which<00:02:08.070> once

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
then your button for bubbles which once

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.819 
then your button for bubbles which once
when<00:02:08.610> you<00:02:08.640> press<00:02:08.940> it<00:02:09.149> it<00:02:09.329> just<00:02:09.600> it's<00:02:10.170> on<00:02:10.440> it'll

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:10.829 
when you press it it just it's on it'll

00:02:10.829 --> 00:02:12.770 
when you press it it just it's on it'll
just<00:02:11.040> keep<00:02:11.220> making<00:02:11.670> bubbles<00:02:12.060> until<00:02:12.239> you<00:02:12.540> tell

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
just keep making bubbles until you tell

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:15.170 
just keep making bubbles until you tell
it<00:02:12.900> to<00:02:12.930> stop<00:02:13.290> and<00:02:13.709> then<00:02:14.370> it's<00:02:14.519> got<00:02:14.670> your<00:02:14.850> trim

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
it to stop and then it's got your trim

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:18.140 
it to stop and then it's got your trim
buttons<00:02:15.680> and<00:02:16.680> at<00:02:16.800> first<00:02:17.010> I<00:02:17.370> was<00:02:17.670> worried<00:02:18.120> that

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
buttons and at first I was worried that

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.690 
buttons and at first I was worried that
they<00:02:18.540> forgot<00:02:18.989> to<00:02:19.290> send<00:02:19.500> me<00:02:19.680> a<00:02:19.709> USB<00:02:20.250> charging

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
they forgot to send me a USB charging

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:21.300 
they forgot to send me a USB charging
cable

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:21.310 
cable

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:24.150 
cable
because<00:02:21.580> I<00:02:21.959> didn't<00:02:22.959> see<00:02:23.110> anything<00:02:23.380> on<00:02:23.680> here<00:02:23.739> to

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:24.160 
because I didn't see anything on here to

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:25.860 
because I didn't see anything on here to
charge<00:02:24.459> it<00:02:24.640> with<00:02:24.849> oh<00:02:25.090> and<00:02:25.300> this<00:02:25.420> is<00:02:25.599> infrared

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
charge it with oh and this is infrared

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:29.940 
charge it with oh and this is infrared
control<00:02:27.330> but<00:02:28.330> hidden<00:02:28.810> away<00:02:28.900> on<00:02:29.200> the<00:02:29.319> side<00:02:29.620> here

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950 
control but hidden away on the side here

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:32.339 
control but hidden away on the side here
there's<00:02:30.190> these<00:02:30.580> little<00:02:30.790> grips<00:02:31.209> well<00:02:31.989> this<00:02:32.140> one

00:02:32.339 --> 00:02:32.349 
there's these little grips well this one

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:35.190 
there's these little grips well this one
on<00:02:32.470> the<00:02:32.560> right<00:02:32.739> actually<00:02:33.300> prise<00:02:34.300> open<00:02:34.900> and

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 
on the right actually prise open and

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.589 
on the right actually prise open and
your<00:02:35.890> charging<00:02:36.310> cables<00:02:36.640> in<00:02:36.790> there<00:02:37.000> so<00:02:37.390> that's

00:02:37.589 --> 00:02:37.599 
your charging cables in there so that's

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:39.120 
your charging cables in there so that's
pretty<00:02:37.810> cool<00:02:38.050> I<00:02:38.110> didn't<00:02:38.500> even<00:02:38.620> notice<00:02:38.830> that

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:39.130 
pretty cool I didn't even notice that

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:41.790 
pretty cool I didn't even notice that
for<00:02:39.370> a<00:02:39.400> while<00:02:39.550> it's<00:02:39.760> very<00:02:40.000> stealthily<00:02:40.800> hidden

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:41.800 
for a while it's very stealthily hidden

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:43.920 
for a while it's very stealthily hidden
in<00:02:41.920> the<00:02:41.980> transmitter<00:02:42.580> there<00:02:42.880> and<00:02:43.480> it<00:02:43.720> takes

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:43.930 
in the transmitter there and it takes

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:45.900 
in the transmitter there and it takes
about<00:02:44.050> 40<00:02:44.560> minutes<00:02:44.590> to<00:02:44.950> charge<00:02:45.250> and<00:02:45.640> get<00:02:45.760> about

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:45.910 
about 40 minutes to charge and get about

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:48.930 
about 40 minutes to charge and get about
seven<00:02:46.420> minutes<00:02:46.569> of<00:02:46.870> flight<00:02:47.459> you<00:02:48.459> know<00:02:48.819> it's<00:02:48.910> a

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:48.940 
seven minutes of flight you know it's a

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:50.790 
seven minutes of flight you know it's a
pretty<00:02:49.180> stable<00:02:49.480> helicopter<00:02:50.230> if<00:02:50.349> it<00:02:50.530> flies

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:50.800 
pretty stable helicopter if it flies

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:53.490 
pretty stable helicopter if it flies
pretty<00:02:51.250> nice<00:02:51.550> the<00:02:52.510> weight<00:02:52.780> is<00:02:52.989> a<00:02:53.019> little<00:02:53.350> bit

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:53.500 
pretty nice the weight is a little bit

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:55.740 
pretty nice the weight is a little bit
weird<00:02:53.769> so<00:02:54.160> it's<00:02:54.459> sometimes<00:02:54.970> it<00:02:55.120> tends<00:02:55.450> to<00:02:55.480> kind

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:55.750 
weird so it's sometimes it tends to kind

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:58.530 
weird so it's sometimes it tends to kind
of<00:02:55.810> drift<00:02:56.110> backwards<00:02:56.620> on<00:02:56.860> its<00:02:56.890> own<00:02:57.540> but

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:58.540 
of drift backwards on its own but

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:01.020 
of drift backwards on its own but
otherwise<00:02:58.780> it<00:02:59.049> it<00:02:59.200> flies<00:02:59.470> pretty<00:02:59.799> well<00:03:00.130> the

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:01.030 
otherwise it it flies pretty well the

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:03.990 
otherwise it it flies pretty well the
reservoir<00:03:01.840> tank<00:03:02.260> doesn't<00:03:02.620> hold<00:03:03.069> a<00:03:03.519> lot<00:03:03.790> of

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:04.000 
reservoir tank doesn't hold a lot of

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.820 
reservoir tank doesn't hold a lot of
bubbles<00:03:04.450> you'll<00:03:04.690> probably<00:03:04.930> run<00:03:05.410> out<00:03:05.470> of<00:03:05.620> the

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:05.830 
bubbles you'll probably run out of the

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:08.550 
bubbles you'll probably run out of the
bubbles<00:03:06.250> before<00:03:07.090> your<00:03:07.540> flight<00:03:07.750> is<00:03:08.110> done<00:03:08.380> if

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:08.560 
bubbles before your flight is done if

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:10.350 
bubbles before your flight is done if
you<00:03:08.709> have<00:03:08.920> it<00:03:09.099> shooting<00:03:09.489> bubbles<00:03:09.849> the<00:03:10.000> entire

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:10.360 
you have it shooting bubbles the entire

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:14.100 
you have it shooting bubbles the entire
time<00:03:10.750> and<00:03:11.140> it<00:03:11.799> looks<00:03:12.069> like<00:03:12.280> there's<00:03:12.519> maybe<00:03:13.110> you

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:14.110 
time and it looks like there's maybe you

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:17.759 
time and it looks like there's maybe you
know<00:03:14.260> five<00:03:14.590> or<00:03:14.860> six<00:03:15.190> tanks<00:03:15.819> worth<00:03:16.180> of<00:03:16.769> bubbles

00:03:17.759 --> 00:03:17.769 
know five or six tanks worth of bubbles

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:19.710 
know five or six tanks worth of bubbles
in<00:03:17.980> here<00:03:18.430> so<00:03:18.670> you'll<00:03:18.880> you'll<00:03:19.150> run<00:03:19.330> out<00:03:19.480> of<00:03:19.510> this

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:19.720 
in here so you'll you'll run out of this

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:21.720 
in here so you'll you'll run out of this
pretty<00:03:19.959> quick<00:03:20.260> but<00:03:20.560> I'm<00:03:20.920> sure<00:03:21.310> you<00:03:21.459> can<00:03:21.489> get

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:21.730 
pretty quick but I'm sure you can get

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:23.400 
pretty quick but I'm sure you can get
this<00:03:21.880> at<00:03:22.090> any<00:03:22.180> store<00:03:22.569> for<00:03:22.930> like<00:03:23.080> you<00:03:23.230> know<00:03:23.290> a

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:23.410 
this at any store for like you know a

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:25.140 
this at any store for like you know a
gallon<00:03:23.920> for<00:03:23.950> a<00:03:24.160> couple<00:03:24.459> bucks<00:03:24.700> or<00:03:24.970> something

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:29.320 
about it so let's go check it out in

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:32.069 
about it so let's go check it out in
flight<00:03:30.180> all<00:03:31.180> right<00:03:31.299> this<00:03:31.510> is<00:03:31.690> the<00:03:31.840> flight

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:32.079 
flight all right this is the flight

00:03:32.079 --> 00:03:35.970 
flight all right this is the flight
review<00:03:32.320> of<00:03:32.739> the<00:03:32.920> RC<00:03:33.430> flying<00:03:33.880> bubble<00:03:34.359> shark<00:03:34.980> and

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:35.980 
review of the RC flying bubble shark and

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:40.940 
review of the RC flying bubble shark and
turn<00:03:36.640> it<00:03:36.790> on<00:03:37.470> turn<00:03:38.470> the<00:03:38.620> helicopter<00:03:38.769> on<00:03:39.220> first

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:40.950 
turn it on turn the helicopter on first

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:43.770 
turn it on turn the helicopter on first
and<00:03:41.950> believe<00:03:42.609> this<00:03:42.760> one's<00:03:43.030> ready<00:03:43.269> to<00:03:43.329> go<00:03:43.420> right

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:43.780 
and believe this one's ready to go right

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:47.309 
and believe this one's ready to go right
away<00:03:43.810> yep<00:03:44.790> all<00:03:45.790> right<00:03:45.940> so<00:03:46.180> I've<00:03:46.299> got<00:03:46.329> the<00:03:46.750> the

00:03:47.309 --> 00:03:47.319 
away yep all right so I've got the the

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:49.680 
away yep all right so I've got the the
bubble<00:03:47.859> reservoir<00:03:48.459> filled<00:03:48.730> up<00:03:48.970> as<00:03:49.150> much<00:03:49.329> as<00:03:49.540> it

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:49.690 
bubble reservoir filled up as much as it

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:51.840 
bubble reservoir filled up as much as it
would<00:03:49.810> let<00:03:50.019> me<00:03:50.230> but<00:03:51.190> I'm<00:03:51.280> gonna<00:03:51.400> go<00:03:51.549> ahead<00:03:51.639> and

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:51.850 
would let me but I'm gonna go ahead and

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:53.550 
would let me but I'm gonna go ahead and
show<00:03:52.000> you<00:03:52.060> how<00:03:52.150> it<00:03:52.389> flies<00:03:52.630> first<00:03:53.139> and<00:03:53.470> then

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:53.560 
show you how it flies first and then

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:56.930 
show you how it flies first and then
we'll<00:03:53.709> turn<00:03:53.859> the<00:03:53.920> bubbles<00:03:54.370> on<00:03:54.549> and<00:03:54.760> go<00:03:55.150> crazy

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:56.940 
we'll turn the bubbles on and go crazy

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:02.559 
we'll turn the bubbles on and go crazy
so<00:03:57.940> it's<00:03:58.090> pretty<00:03:58.299> loud<00:03:58.660> but<00:04:00.030> quite<00:04:01.030> stable

00:04:02.559 --> 00:04:02.569 
so it's pretty loud but quite stable

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:05.229 
so it's pretty loud but quite stable
it<00:04:03.469> kind<00:04:03.829> of<00:04:03.920> drifts<00:04:04.430> a<00:04:04.519> little<00:04:04.819> bit<00:04:05.030> because

00:04:05.229 --> 00:04:05.239 
it kind of drifts a little bit because

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:07.330 
it kind of drifts a little bit because
of<00:04:05.480> the<00:04:05.689> weight<00:04:06.140> I<00:04:06.499> think<00:04:06.680> it's<00:04:06.859> kind<00:04:07.099> of<00:04:07.159> got

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:07.340 
of the weight I think it's kind of got

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:10.119 
of the weight I think it's kind of got
some<00:04:07.579> weird<00:04:08.379> center<00:04:09.379> of<00:04:09.469> gravity<00:04:09.980> or

00:04:10.119 --> 00:04:10.129 
some weird center of gravity or

00:04:10.129 --> 00:04:13.300 
some weird center of gravity or
something<00:04:10.639> that<00:04:11.530> holds<00:04:12.530> its<00:04:12.680> hover<00:04:12.889> really

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:13.310 
something that holds its hover really

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:19.330 
something that holds its hover really
nice<00:04:13.549> not<00:04:13.999> a<00:04:14.030> lot<00:04:14.299> of<00:04:14.329> throttle<00:04:14.900> control<00:04:18.340> this

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:19.340 
nice not a lot of throttle control this

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:22.960 
nice not a lot of throttle control this
is<00:04:19.519> on<00:04:19.699> lower<00:04:20.269> rates<00:04:21.070> when<00:04:22.070> we<00:04:22.190> turn<00:04:22.490> on<00:04:22.729> this

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:22.970 
is on lower rates when we turn on this

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:26.290 
is on lower rates when we turn on this
now<00:04:23.419> it's<00:04:23.690> higher<00:04:23.960> rate<00:04:24.259> pull<00:04:24.560> forward<00:04:25.300> so

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:26.300 
now it's higher rate pull forward so

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:28.719 
now it's higher rate pull forward so
it's<00:04:26.509> not<00:04:26.630> a<00:04:26.690> speed<00:04:27.080> demon<00:04:27.349> but<00:04:27.860> it's<00:04:28.370> quick

00:04:28.719 --> 00:04:28.729 
it's not a speed demon but it's quick

00:04:28.729 --> 00:04:35.280 
it's not a speed demon but it's quick
enough

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:35.290 

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:39.120 

turn<00:04:35.680> back<00:04:35.950> to<00:04:36.190> normal<00:04:36.220> low<00:04:37.120> rates<00:04:37.860> here's<00:04:38.860> the

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:39.130 
turn back to normal low rates here's the

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:41.700 
turn back to normal low rates here's the
demo<00:04:39.430> so<00:04:40.270> now<00:04:40.450> you<00:04:40.510> just<00:04:40.720> hold<00:04:41.230> the<00:04:41.470> throttle

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:41.710 
demo so now you just hold the throttle

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:45.860 
demo so now you just hold the throttle
in<00:04:42.160> it<00:04:42.600> it<00:04:43.600> does<00:04:43.960> some<00:04:44.350> right<00:04:45.040> stick<00:04:45.460> movements

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:45.870 
in it it does some right stick movements

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:51.720 
in it it does some right stick movements
that's<00:04:46.870> just<00:04:47.230> doing<00:04:47.380> all<00:04:47.590> out<00:04:47.860> on<00:04:48.010> its<00:04:48.190> own<00:04:50.730> all

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:51.730 
that's just doing all out on its own all

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:54.600 
that's just doing all out on its own all
right<00:04:52.090> that's<00:04:52.390> the<00:04:52.510> demo<00:04:53.040> all<00:04:54.040> right<00:04:54.250> so<00:04:54.430> let's

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:54.610 
right that's the demo all right so let's

00:04:54.610 --> 00:05:00.840 
right that's the demo all right so let's
go<00:04:54.760> ahead<00:04:54.970> and<00:04:55.090> turn<00:04:55.270> some<00:04:55.510> bubbles<00:04:55.810> on<00:04:59.850> there

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:00.850 
go ahead and turn some bubbles on there

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:02.250 
go ahead and turn some bubbles on there
they<00:05:00.940> go

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:02.260 
they go

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:06.360 
they go
we<00:05:03.220> know<00:05:03.400> if<00:05:03.520> that's<00:05:03.700> showing<00:05:04.090> up<00:05:04.180> on<00:05:04.360> Vidia<00:05:05.370> so

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:06.370 
we know if that's showing up on Vidia so

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:08.910 
we know if that's showing up on Vidia so
the<00:05:06.580> the<00:05:07.060> prop<00:05:07.420> watch<00:05:07.780> just<00:05:08.200> kind<00:05:08.500> of<00:05:08.620> blows

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:08.920 
the the prop watch just kind of blows

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:13.890 
the the prop watch just kind of blows
the<00:05:08.950> bubbles<00:05:09.810> straight<00:05:10.810> down<00:05:12.150> so<00:05:13.150> it's<00:05:13.360> kind

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:13.900 
the bubbles straight down so it's kind

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:16.260 
the bubbles straight down so it's kind
of<00:05:14.520> kind<00:05:15.520> of<00:05:15.730> pointless

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:16.270 
of kind of pointless

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:19.320 
of kind of pointless
they<00:05:16.690> don't<00:05:16.900> really<00:05:17.850> doesn't<00:05:18.850> really<00:05:18.970> make

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:19.330 
they don't really doesn't really make

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:21.270 
they don't really doesn't really make
too<00:05:19.660> many<00:05:19.840> bubbles<00:05:20.410> and<00:05:20.680> it<00:05:20.770> just<00:05:20.920> kind<00:05:21.160> of

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:21.280 
too many bubbles and it just kind of

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:25.050 
too many bubbles and it just kind of
spits<00:05:22.500> bubble<00:05:23.500> liquid<00:05:23.950> everywhere<00:05:24.280> so<00:05:24.910> you've

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:25.060 
spits bubble liquid everywhere so you've

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:27.470 
spits bubble liquid everywhere so you've
kind<00:05:25.300> of<00:05:25.420> got<00:05:25.540> a<00:05:25.570> mess<00:05:25.930> after<00:05:26.380> you're<00:05:26.560> done

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:27.480 
kind of got a mess after you're done

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:33.020 
kind of got a mess after you're done
like<00:05:28.480> bubble<00:05:28.930> residue<00:05:29.440> all<00:05:29.680> over<00:05:29.710> the<00:05:30.040> ground

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:33.030 

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:35.490 

but<00:05:34.030> it's<00:05:34.360> kind<00:05:34.570> of<00:05:34.690> funny<00:05:34.930> though<00:05:35.230> just

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:35.500 
but it's kind of funny though just

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:38.370 
but it's kind of funny though just
seeing<00:05:35.710> a<00:05:36.180> shark<00:05:37.180> flying<00:05:37.690> through<00:05:38.050> the<00:05:38.170> air

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:38.380 
seeing a shark flying through the air

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:42.210 
seeing a shark flying through the air
shooting<00:05:39.220> bubbles<00:05:39.610> everywhere<00:05:41.070> so<00:05:42.070> we'll

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:42.220 
shooting bubbles everywhere so we'll

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:44.040 
shooting bubbles everywhere so we'll
just<00:05:42.340> kind<00:05:42.550> of<00:05:42.700> let<00:05:42.850> it<00:05:42.880> keep<00:05:43.150> going<00:05:43.210> until<00:05:43.720> it

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:44.050 
just kind of let it keep going until it

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:49.830 
just kind of let it keep going until it
runs<00:05:44.260> out<00:05:44.530> see<00:05:45.010> how<00:05:45.160> long<00:05:45.370> a<00:05:45.430> tank<00:05:45.880> lasts

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:49.840 

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:54.960 

and<00:05:50.160> looks<00:05:51.160> like<00:05:51.280> it's<00:05:51.550> already<00:05:51.880> done<00:05:52.389> oh<00:05:53.970> yeah

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:54.970 
and looks like it's already done oh yeah

00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:55.800 
and looks like it's already done oh yeah
that's<00:05:55.300> it

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:55.810 
that's it

00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:59.070 
that's it
so<00:05:56.470> that<00:05:56.650> was<00:05:56.889> a<00:05:56.919> full<00:05:57.460> tank<00:05:58.150> of<00:05:58.360> bubbles<00:05:58.780> right

00:05:59.070 --> 00:05:59.080 
so that was a full tank of bubbles right

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:00.900 
so that was a full tank of bubbles right
there<00:05:59.110> gone<00:05:59.680> and<00:06:00.070> what<00:06:00.400> was<00:06:00.550> that<00:06:00.700> like<00:06:00.880> a

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:00.910 
there gone and what was that like a

00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:05.070 
there gone and what was that like a
minute<00:06:01.360> if<00:06:01.510> that<00:06:02.880> but<00:06:03.880> you<00:06:04.060> know<00:06:04.210> kind<00:06:04.630> of<00:06:04.720> kind

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:05.080 
minute if that but you know kind of kind

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:06.870 
minute if that but you know kind of kind
of<00:06:05.139> cool<00:06:05.350> little<00:06:05.560> gimmick<00:06:06.070> I<00:06:06.250> think<00:06:06.460> this<00:06:06.610> was

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:06.880 
of cool little gimmick I think this was

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:11.400 
of cool little gimmick I think this was
30<00:06:07.570> or<00:06:07.780> 35<00:06:08.530> dollars<00:06:09.070> so<00:06:09.540> not<00:06:10.540> bad<00:06:10.780> for<00:06:11.139> what<00:06:11.320> it

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:11.410 
30 or 35 dollars so not bad for what it

00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:13.470 
30 or 35 dollars so not bad for what it
is<00:06:11.440> if<00:06:11.830> you've<00:06:11.980> got<00:06:12.010> a<00:06:12.220> shark<00:06:12.730> fan<00:06:13.060> in<00:06:13.300> your

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:13.480 
is if you've got a shark fan in your

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:15.420 
is if you've got a shark fan in your
life<00:06:13.660> they<00:06:14.110> would<00:06:14.260> probably<00:06:14.770> get<00:06:14.919> a<00:06:14.950> kick<00:06:15.250> out

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:15.430 
life they would probably get a kick out

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:18.330 
life they would probably get a kick out
of<00:06:15.460> it<00:06:15.700> I<00:06:16.050> like<00:06:17.050> sharks<00:06:17.440> so<00:06:17.830> I<00:06:17.889> thought<00:06:18.190> it<00:06:18.280> was

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:18.340 
of it I like sharks so I thought it was

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:21.720 
of it I like sharks so I thought it was
pretty<00:06:18.580> cool<00:06:20.040> all<00:06:21.040> right<00:06:21.160> well<00:06:21.370> that's<00:06:21.490> all

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:21.730 
pretty cool all right well that's all

00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:23.550 
pretty cool all right well that's all
there<00:06:21.880> is<00:06:21.910> to<00:06:22.180> this<00:06:22.300> one<00:06:22.540> not<00:06:22.750> much<00:06:22.960> to<00:06:23.260> it<00:06:23.380> and

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:23.560 
there is to this one not much to it and

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:25.170 
there is to this one not much to it and
I<00:06:23.590> think<00:06:23.800> I<00:06:23.889> showed<00:06:24.130> it<00:06:24.310> all<00:06:24.430> so<00:06:24.729> let's<00:06:24.910> take<00:06:25.150> it

00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:25.180 
I think I showed it all so let's take it

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:27.290 
I think I showed it all so let's take it
in<00:06:25.360> for<00:06:25.570> a<00:06:25.600> landing

00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:27.300 
in for a landing

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:29.070 
in for a landing
nice<00:06:28.300> landing

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:29.080 
nice landing

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:31.140 
nice landing
all<00:06:29.440> right<00:06:29.560> well<00:06:29.710> that's<00:06:29.800> it<00:06:30.070> that's<00:06:30.250> the<00:06:30.430> RC
