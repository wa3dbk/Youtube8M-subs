00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.929
 United States leaked 

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:06.629
 bacteriological weapons 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:08.309
 This sensational news published 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:09.740
 Today several popular 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:11.910
 American editions 

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:14.340
 journalists claim that america 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:17.119
 surveys around the world threatens 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:19.170
 deadly epidemic cause which 

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:20.720
 artificial bacterium grown in 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.760
 secret laboratories in the United States 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:25.859
 Sinti is so called bacterium was 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.930
 created to deal with petroleum choices 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:30.269
 yourself after the accident in the gulf of mexico 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:33.149
 but for some reason she 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:34.250
 switched to the destruction of animals and 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:36.750
 people 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:40.590
 two or three semenyuk recorded chronicle 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:43.559
 terrible hunt ivan it seems Americans 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.570
 opened the pandora's box if earlier leading 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.820
 world scientists thought how to create 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:50.250
 unique artificial bacterium then 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.530
 now and puzzles over how her 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.899
 stop these frames made in 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:57.570
 the us state of virginia just for 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:01:00.629
 one night on the shore threw three at once 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.850
 a dozen dolphins are shocked 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:05.909
 mammals bodies were covered 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:08.520
 terrible wounds before such never 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:10.530
 it was not until the dolphin died in the former 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.420
 years but not in such numbers for 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.780
 last 2 months already hundreds of victims 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:17.909
 moreover, the body is covered with incomprehensible ulcers 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:20.430
 biologist from moscow peter garya think 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:22.860
 that the dolphins became a victim of unique 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:25.020
 bacteria the americans used them for 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:29.100
 oil spill response in mexican 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:32.850
 Gulf stuffed there these most 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:34.890
 sons base synthetic synthetic 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.990
 the bacteria themselves are not sentio synthetic 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.390
 genetic apparatus is the largest in 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:42.960
 stories not in mining accident occurred in 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:45.270
 April 2010 to eliminate it 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:48.659
 consequences of us power used 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:51.750
 the latest development of genetics bacterium 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:52.350
 Cynthia programmed to eating 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.290
 of oil 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.880
 however, it soon became clear that 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:59.850
 artificial cells are not so 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:01.030
 safe they mutate endlessly later 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.610
 there is 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:05.290
 viruses that live in them 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:07.360
 is the transfer system means 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:09.459
 dna fragments and another bacterium after me 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:11.530
 so how is the transformation of bacteria and 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:14.200
 there is more and more new 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:17.230
 monstrous combinations in the laboratory 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:19.420
 molecular biology omgu attentively 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:19.870
 monitor developments overseas 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:22.950
 colleagues 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:25.800
 the scientist Peter Kamensk called senkyu 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:28.630
 a real breakthrough in biotechnology 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:31.090
 After all, an artificial bacterium can 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:33.910
 use for different purposes for example 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:36.790
 to produce energy from carbon dioxide 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:40.810
 gas for the destruction of oil spills and 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:43.590
 even eliminating the enemy using cynthia 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:46.440
 as a bacteriological weapon 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:50.140
 due to the fact that the genome is actually 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:51.970
 who will work in this future 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:55.260
 art bacteria researchers 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:58.080
 collect themselves roughly by hand 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:00.850
 you can program 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:03.209
 absolutely any Russian properties 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:06.040
 biologists are confident in the gulf of mexico 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:08.980
 the program crashed for the incomprehensible 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:12.180
 reasons bacteria stopped destroying 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:15.850
 oil and switched to living organisms 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:18.760
 they not only became way or zerowatt 

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:19.510
 oil and methane they began to attack everything 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:21.670
 living 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:25.870
 breed on fish on 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:26.950
 jellyfish on corals for all that lives 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:29.950
 gulf of mexico 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:32.050
 terrible swelling and bruises and intolerable 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:34.810
 dental this American turned to 

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:38.050
 doctors complaining of indisposition at once 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:39.910
 after swimming in the gulf of mexico 

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:42.610
 I don't know where it came from 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:45.880
 but I'm very sick and scared Peter 

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:48.400
 garyaev sure woman became a victim all 

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:50.110
 same synth all this liquidity on 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:51.030
 territories of the united states go to 

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:53.769
 depth and and 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:55.090
 the coast there the ness is already amazed about from there 

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:57.670
 run all run 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:04:00.069
 Peter Garyaev not rule out that soon 

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:02.440
 following the marine life from 

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:05.980
 synthetic bacteria will start to die 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:07.989
 people and the world will overwhelm a terrible epidemic 

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:10.900
 stop which man will 

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:13.450
 not easy as I saw doctors treat 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:15.700
 the affected skin is incredible 

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:18.340
 difficult because voracious synth 

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:21.299
 resistant to all modern 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:21.299
 antibiotics
