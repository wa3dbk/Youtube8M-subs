move it down up right there and then you
got<00:01:32.579> your<00:01:33.290> sensitivity<00:01:34.290> right<00:01:35.210> there<00:01:36.210> and<00:01:37.220> so

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220

I<00:01:50.260> don't<00:01:51.260> really<00:01:51.380> touch<00:01:51.650> the<00:01:51.680> sensitivity

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:52.460 
I don't really touch the sensitivity

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:55.390 
I don't really touch the sensitivity
much<00:01:52.640> I<00:01:52.820> mean<00:01:53.000> three<00:01:53.870> works<00:01:54.170> perfect<00:01:54.770> for<00:01:55.010> me

and then he also got different modes you

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:04.960 
and then he also got different modes you
got<00:01:59.510> welding<00:02:00.190> you<00:02:01.190> get<00:02:01.810> let's<00:02:02.810> change<00:02:03.290> to<00:02:03.970> you

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:04.970 
got welding you get let's change to you

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:10.779 
got welding you get let's change to you
got<00:02:05.150> a<00:02:05.180> just<00:02:06.700> standard<00:02:07.700> cut<00:02:08.060> five<00:02:09.580> you<00:02:10.580> got

00:02:10.779 --> 00:02:10.789 
got a just standard cut five you got

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:14.470 
got a just standard cut five you got
grind<00:02:11.600> moan<00:02:12.130> which<00:02:13.130> just<00:02:13.790> moves<00:02:14.180> it<00:02:14.300> to<00:02:14.450> a

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:14.480 
grind moan which just moves it to a

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:19.449 
grind moan which just moves it to a
stationary<00:02:14.989> 3<00:02:15.670> and<00:02:16.670> then<00:02:16.880> X<00:02:17.450> mode<00:02:18.070> for<00:02:19.070> low

00:02:19.449 --> 00:02:19.459 
stationary 3 and then X mode for low

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:23.320 
stationary 3 and then X mode for low
amperage<00:02:20.860> welding<00:02:21.860> and<00:02:22.459> that<00:02:22.820> bumps<00:02:23.150> the

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:23.330 
amperage welding and that bumps the

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:25.449 
amperage welding and that bumps the
sentence<00:02:23.630> the<00:02:23.690> table<00:02:23.930> you<00:02:24.020> have<00:02:24.110> to<00:02:24.290> eat<00:02:24.500> the

sentence the table you have to eat the
helmets<00:02:25.790> really<00:02:26.090> nice<00:02:26.270> and<00:02:26.510> the<00:02:26.600> fact<00:02:26.930> that<00:02:27.760> if

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:37.640 
bit if you're if you're actually MIG

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:39.550 
bit if you're if you're actually MIG
welding<00:02:38.150> your<00:02:38.330> stick<00:02:38.630> welding<00:02:39.050> or<00:02:39.200> anything

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:39.560 
welding your stick welding or anything

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:40.600 
welding your stick welding or anything
that's<00:02:39.709> got<00:02:39.860> a<00:02:39.920> lot<00:02:40.100> of<00:02:40.130> spatter

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:40.610 
that's got a lot of spatter

that's got a lot of spatter
as<00:02:41.480> you<00:02:41.600> can<00:02:41.750> see<00:02:42.250> cover<00:02:43.250> plate<00:02:43.550> it's<00:02:44.269> pretty

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:45.260 
as you can see cover plate it's pretty

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.100 
as you can see cover plate it's pretty
bad<00:02:45.440> I<00:02:45.470> mean<00:02:46.060> usually<00:02:47.060> when<00:02:47.390> it<00:02:47.540> gets<00:02:47.720> to<00:02:47.989> about

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:48.110 
bad I mean usually when it gets to about

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:51.520 
bad I mean usually when it gets to about
this<00:02:48.500> I<00:02:48.980> mean<00:02:49.610> it<00:02:49.670> don't<00:02:49.790> look<00:02:50.030> too<00:02:50.269> dirty<00:02:50.530> but

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:51.530 
this I mean it don't look too dirty but

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:54.490 
this I mean it don't look too dirty but
it<00:02:51.650> is<00:02:51.830> and<00:02:52.900> when<00:02:53.900> you're<00:02:54.019> not<00:02:54.170> wearing

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:54.500 
it is and when you're not wearing

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:56.560 
it is and when you're not wearing
glasses<00:02:54.709> while<00:02:55.160> you're<00:02:55.340> welding<00:02:55.760> it's

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:56.570 
glasses while you're welding it's

00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:02.350 
glasses while you're welding it's
especially<00:02:58.810> necessary<00:02:59.810> for<00:03:00.560> your<00:03:00.910> lens<00:03:01.910> to<00:03:02.330> be

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:02.360 
especially necessary for your lens to be

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:05.140 
especially necessary for your lens to be
completely<00:03:03.080> cleared<00:03:04.040> so<00:03:04.640> you<00:03:04.700> can<00:03:04.940> actually

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:05.150 
completely cleared so you can actually

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:10.690 
completely cleared so you can actually
see<00:03:06.640> but<00:03:07.640> I<00:03:07.760> mean<00:03:07.940> changing<00:03:08.750> out<00:03:08.870> the<00:03:09.700> cover

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:10.700 
see but I mean changing out the cover

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:14.770 
see but I mean changing out the cover
plate<00:03:11.000> it's<00:03:11.120> really<00:03:11.480> easy<00:03:11.690> it's<00:03:12.410> got<00:03:13.780> two

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:14.780 
plate it's really easy it's got two

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:17.560 
plate it's really easy it's got two
little<00:03:15.079> clips<00:03:15.440> right<00:03:15.920> here<00:03:16.370> and<00:03:16.579> same<00:03:17.540> thing

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:17.570 
little clips right here and same thing

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:20.500 
little clips right here and same thing
here<00:03:17.900> down<00:03:18.590> at<00:03:18.769> the<00:03:18.799> bottom<00:03:19.360> what<00:03:20.360> I<00:03:20.390> do

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:20.510 
here down at the bottom what I do

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:23.020 
here down at the bottom what I do
because<00:03:21.290> I<00:03:21.500> was<00:03:21.620> those<00:03:22.220> are<00:03:22.370> small<00:03:22.700> and<00:03:22.940> it

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:23.030 
because I was those are small and it

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:25.180 
because I was those are small and it
kind<00:03:23.209> of<00:03:23.269> reminded<00:03:23.660> me<00:03:23.720> of<00:03:23.840> red<00:03:24.500> nor<00:03:24.799> how<00:03:25.040> they

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:25.190 
kind of reminded me of red nor how they

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:28.210 
kind of reminded me of red nor how they
get<00:03:25.900> parsed<00:03:26.900> I<00:03:27.019> just<00:03:27.230> want<00:03:27.470> to<00:03:27.799> jump

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:28.220 
get parsed I just want to jump

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:34.330 
get parsed I just want to jump
off<00:03:28.459> your<00:03:28.850> helmet<00:03:29.560> so<00:03:30.560> I<00:03:31.780> figured<00:03:32.780> out<00:03:32.900> that<00:03:33.340> if

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:34.340 
off your helmet so I figured out that if

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:36.009 
off your helmet so I figured out that if
you<00:03:34.430> put<00:03:34.640> your<00:03:34.790> thumb<00:03:34.850> and<00:03:35.299> put<00:03:35.570> your<00:03:35.720> finger

00:03:36.009 --> 00:03:36.019 
you put your thumb and put your finger

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:40.319 
you put your thumb and put your finger
your<00:03:36.320> thumb<00:03:36.350> right<00:03:37.280> between<00:03:37.459> and<00:03:38.350> pull<00:03:39.350> up

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:40.329 
your thumb right between and pull up

00:03:40.329 --> 00:03:43.160 
your thumb right between and pull up
with<00:03:41.329> your<00:03:41.450> nail

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:43.170 
with your nail

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:48.370 
with your nail
it's<00:03:43.920> easier<00:03:44.190> with<00:03:44.370> your<00:03:44.460> thumb<00:03:44.760> then<00:03:45.060> you<00:03:45.870> can

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:48.380 

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:54.040 

come<00:03:49.380> on<00:03:50.210> there<00:03:51.210> you<00:03:51.240> go<00:03:51.380> you<00:03:52.380> can<00:03:52.620> get<00:03:52.800> your

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:54.050 
come on there you go you can get your

00:03:54.050 --> 00:04:00.140 
come on there you go you can get your
cover<00:03:55.050> plate<00:03:55.350> out<00:03:55.530> real<00:03:55.800> easy<00:03:56.160> and<00:03:58.940> it's<00:03:59.940> easy

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:00.150 
cover plate out real easy and it's easy

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:01.670 
cover plate out real easy and it's easy
to<00:04:00.270> figure<00:04:00.630> out<00:04:00.720> how<00:04:00.870> to<00:04:00.960> put<00:04:01.140> it<00:04:01.230> back<00:04:01.380> on

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:01.680 
to figure out how to put it back on

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:04.270 
to figure out how to put it back on
what's<00:04:02.430> really<00:04:02.700> nice<00:04:03.000> about<00:04:03.060> this<00:04:03.600> helmet

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:04.280 
what's really nice about this helmet

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:08.830 
what's really nice about this helmet
unlike<00:04:05.280> my<00:04:05.460> old<00:04:05.610> helmet<00:04:06.170> all<00:04:07.170> the<00:04:07.350> electronics

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:08.840 
unlike my old helmet all the electronics

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:12.949 
unlike my old helmet all the electronics
are<00:04:09.840> right<00:04:10.110> here<00:04:10.560> and<00:04:11.600> this<00:04:12.600> is<00:04:12.660> why<00:04:12.900> the

00:04:12.949 --> 00:04:12.959 
are right here and this is why the

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:18.170 
are right here and this is why the
helmet<00:04:13.380> cost<00:04:13.560> so<00:04:13.860> much<00:04:14.720> but<00:04:16.940> let's<00:04:17.940> say<00:04:18.120> you

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:18.180
