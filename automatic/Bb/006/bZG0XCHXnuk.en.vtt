00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:19.609
 the selection of 34 is I bring a video 

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:21.470
 of gta 5 as you can see if the 

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:23.860
 parked coffee 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:25.930
 in him 

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:27.820
 in him 

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:29.920
 in the hangar we're going to steal a 

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:34.619
 previous chapter good what they rob in 

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:34.619
 the chapter if you want to watch the video 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:40.920
 I will not put the description here for a 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:40.920
 link or so 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:47.149
 they talk to talk to see how good what 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:49.550
 first this video and also warn 

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:54.110
 say what is not live is worth but 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:57.500
 good and tell you that I do not understand very well 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:59.650
 the coffee theme 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:02.290
 strange why not 

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:04.320
 there is not a moment that you give me in the 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:06.810
 video when these images are 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:12.350
 precious the truth how they fly like a 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:12.350
 letter out there looks like a movie 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:21.490
 well that hunting there is a moment in the 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:24.200
 that runs out of fuel 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:26.300
 I do not know what's wrong but 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:29.210
 the strangers 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:32.990
 I can be surprised, this is the best 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:35.500
 fastest plane in the game 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:40.790
 the second fastest 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:45.290
 the private plane but he 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:47.840
 the commercial boeing 747 this big and the 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:50.750
 room of the 130 c as you can see 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:54.200
 in this camera it is very easy to put it 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:55.950
 in the xbox with the view and in the play with the 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:59.969
 circle 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:02.579
 already on the computer I do not know but well I 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:05.149
 these images has not happened now as 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:09.710
 It seems to be like a documentary 

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:09.710
 above all there are those twists and everything 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:15.239
 good 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:18.959
 as you can see now a little bit is going to 

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:22.069
 start spending good gas until 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:22.069
 I know or I do not know what happens 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:29.480
 and if each product had followed but 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:31.760
 then I am a little more 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:36.600
 exaggerated good this video is going to be very 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:40.260
 short because it is not either or not 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:42.720
 upload videos either as the first of 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:44.210
 12 minutes well I think I'm going to do 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:47.150
 a 

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:49.370
 an introduction I know it's late for 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:51.770
 do it but good a presentation of 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:54.800
 well here it has already been spent 

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:56.270
 it works the engines but good 

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:58.910
 keep in mind that when you are 

00:02:56.270 --> 00:03:01.850
 falling you to put it down in 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:03.110
 well do not do it the chopped all 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:05.810
 it is simply to put it as I am 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:08.570
 holding and now with the nose looking 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:10.850
 up because if you do not give us time 

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:13.010
 out when getting the water will get 

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:15.620
 so deeply on the web that a little 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:17.030
 you will have time to come out good and that 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:20.300
 Even if it's a bit late 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:21.290
 two gta iv videos as there is a 

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:23.000
 good introduction this is the way 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:26.180
 correct enters the water so that it does not 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:30.410
 sink a lot but also sinks what 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:31.610
 yours but no and there's a shark and 

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:34.070
 hit a few scares with the sharks 

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:38.090
 because suddenly they get out and kill you 

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:39.560
 if you do not say good, it's giving 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:41.720
 turns around me but does not attack me 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:44.360
 but when he attacks me normal that she 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:46.340
 I killed but you do not spin me 

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:48.170
 and that puts the nerves because it says is 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:49.460
 mine and when I will attack at least 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:52.240
 you expect it is when it attacks you or if 

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:52.240
 you say where is 

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:56.790
 I'm supposed to be there 

00:03:54.300 --> 00:04:00.690
 full high does not attack me because I do not know what 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:02.970
 is waiting for what happens next 

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:07.070
 and recording the video feels a scare 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:07.070
 awful but not what I keep saying 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:12.360
 I said it looks like a shark movie 

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:15.190
 that what I'm going to do the introduction 

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:17.590
 it's worth the next video will be 

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:20.530
 Introduction of 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:25.770
 from gta iv the shark attacks me but 

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:25.770
 good introduction of gta iv usa 

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:31.889
 I got a scare laugh but it's a 

00:04:28.889 --> 00:04:33.750
 bug that shark is a white I do not know what 

00:04:31.889 --> 00:04:39.210
 is that last white will be like that and good 

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:41.300
 well then I will not upload introduction in the 

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:44.040
 I'll say a little bit about what the video is going to go 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:47.820
 and good 

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:49.500
 well, more or less the video would be that way 

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:53.940
 a bit then to teach a little in 

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:57.570
 hunt talk and all that so good 

00:04:53.940 --> 00:05:00.500
 guys then remember to vote subscribe and 

00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:00.500
