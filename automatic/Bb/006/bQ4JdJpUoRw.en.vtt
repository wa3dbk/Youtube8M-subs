00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
their special heat treat so they call it

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:13.130 
their special heat treat so they call it

SR 101 differentially heat treated so

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:14.899 
SR 101 differentially heat treated so
it's<00:01:13.320> harder<00:01:13.619> along<00:01:13.830> the<00:01:13.979> edge<00:01:14.130> than<00:01:14.580> along

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
it's harder along the edge than along

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:16.880 
it's harder along the edge than along
the<00:01:15.030> spine<00:01:15.270> to<00:01:15.479> give<00:01:15.600> it<00:01:15.720> a<00:01:15.780> good<00:01:15.930> mix<00:01:16.140> of<00:01:16.350> edge

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
the spine to give it a good mix of edge

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.880 
the spine to give it a good mix of edge
holding<00:01:17.490> strength<00:01:17.939> and<00:01:18.650> lateral<00:01:19.650> bending

ability quarter-inch stocks so thick

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.469 
ability quarter-inch stocks so thick
enough<00:01:22.890> for<00:01:22.950> just<00:01:23.909> about<00:01:24.000> anything

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
enough for just about anything

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:28.789 
enough for just about anything
and<00:01:24.830> as<00:01:25.830> usual<00:01:26.100> micarta<00:01:27.119> attached<00:01:27.600> with<00:01:27.930> all

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
and as usual micarta attached with all

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
room to choke up on the blade for

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.609 
room to choke up on the blade for
carving<00:01:40.650> or<00:01:41.250> for<00:01:41.640> using<00:01:41.880> it<00:01:41.970> as<00:01:42.060> a<00:01:42.090> draw<00:01:42.329> knife
