00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:10.220
 I make mineral-rich vegetables but how to make soil 

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:20.500
 The correct answer is we recommend that you use a well-balanced courage correct and the black world 

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:34.290
 Thing, such as shellfish fossils and organic opportunities 

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:34.290
 In the case of overpassing, it is effective in the mineral resupply route of the soil because it absorbs the minerals in the sea 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:41.690
 And Kudo incision 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:51.370
 Well, the Kud incision contains magnesium 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:51.370
 The presence or absence Shi sleep bug is essential to under a is the growth of all plants of chlorophyll 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:04.500
 Please be careful also of the world overpass 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:08.250
 I think depending on the month , but 100 grams per tsubo in a year 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:11.280
 I think that the amount of production of Cry is enough 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:17.000
 This is because the compost and fertilizer are using everyday 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:17.000
 It is because there are many things which the incision is included about 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:32.350
 The first supplies at least 7 kilometers of input mystical creatures per 1 tsubo 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:35.770
 Make sure to use compost that is completely ripe 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:37.579
 Cn ratio as a measure of compost used 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:43.060
 Nitrogen carbon date 

00:01:37.579 --> 00:01:43.060
 Is 19 we recommend that you use the following things 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:52.720
 So cheap contrast is using construction waste materials as materials and so it falls 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:55.150
 Because there are many unfinished things 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:57.810
 To use a reliable second 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:57.810
 Recommend 

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:06.700
 Please as much as possible with those of organic fertilizers 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:16.660
 Organic fertilizer is the best way to make the soil rich in minerals, but at least 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:24.270
 Let's use abolished school fertilizer 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:24.270
 If you rely on chemical fertilizers too much, you will become desert soil or reddish 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:33.570
 If you mix soil with compost or fertilizer , be sure to lay the soil 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:38.860
 Those that mix to the soil and say the ideal is
