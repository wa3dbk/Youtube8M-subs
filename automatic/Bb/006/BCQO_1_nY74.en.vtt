00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.309
 Ah 

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:21.680
 and paul him in the car rental is approx 

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:23.090
 and June start but after the 

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:25.220
 to the assignments of the past 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:27.320
 year started 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:30.529
 After a few weeks we went to Plain with our 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:32.180
 evaluation and after the evaluation we go too 

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:34.449
 immediately start talking about another theme 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:34.449
 produce 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:39.199
 think in april have it cm off 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:40.730
 finally we there among other things 

00:00:39.199 --> 00:00:42.800
 such a drawing is made every year 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:44.629
 within a budget in that what those 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:46.850
 we now serve Marinus our over 

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:51.409
 an association say in marssum and 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:53.479
 then we go further back I have 

00:00:51.409 --> 00:00:56.180
 a budget of around 5000 euros 

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:59.000
 with which we want to realize the layers and 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:03.640
 are like iron and paint what the 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.640
 fridge the lock things like that 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:15.130
 Well 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.430
 Oh 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:30.320
 and you also work together with others 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:32.119
 associations purchasing your material 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:35.240
 Of course we keep the club in 

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:37.940
 and that something also done through it 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:38.810
 company here for the mouse him and me 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:41.360
 something so everyone has their own 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:43.310
 sponsor a company they would rather have one 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:45.170
 lost with easy cherishing and then you can 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:46.250
 you do not want to tackle the large-scale approach 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:47.000
 in the end it is a car of 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:48.740
 ootmarsum 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.259
 And well, that 's how we want it to be 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:52.310
 keep the man-hours that is in the car 

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:53.659
 stabbed 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:56.479
 you also include it in the budget 

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:58.640
 with a puncture there is certainly no longer something 

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:02.600
 that is a very low 5000 euro 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:04.640
 amount becomes much more yes because how much 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:05.600
 hour is there where can you get one 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:07.220
 make an estimation 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.600
 I don't really want that estimate 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:11.540
 because the boys from the 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:13.360
 wagon bodice are sometimes every weekday 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:15.769
 busy in the evening cc and so in the weekend 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:20.090
 certainly now almost in the last few weeks 

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:21.769
 day out so that really is not finished 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:23.600
 put on something for your urine 

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:25.880
 the last week a story is really that 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:27.830
 Here , too, all day has everything 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:29.390
 are and 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:30.769
 well me seven days a week 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:32.900
 say the last mile and the car 

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:34.880
 and if you looked while for the 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:36.350
 holidays not every night with german 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:38.420
 build but it takes a lot of hours 

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:41.739
 how big is the 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:41.739
 the bowl is plus minus 25 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:55.629
 5000 euros for 170 people ' clothing 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:57.430
 do it with the parades I so big 

00:02:55.629 --> 00:02:59.260
 is the running group paying for that 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:00.909
 so you get something of that 5,000 euros back 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:03.459
 they do indeed pay one 

00:03:00.909 --> 00:03:06.219
 amount for their suit this year it brushes 

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:07.599
 pack 25 euros but that's where the ride is 

00:03:06.219 --> 00:03:09.790
 after oldenzaal start 

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:11.139
 they can take the bus for free 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:13.629
 oldenzaal then and back again 

00:03:11.139 --> 00:03:15.069
 of course and indeed bake those people 

00:03:13.629 --> 00:03:16.540
 must have food because they have to be there 

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:18.219
 even though they have to walk the morning 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:19.989
 be early 

00:03:18.219 --> 00:03:21.310
 no matter how you get there 

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:23.230
 sponsored 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:27.250
 Richard van de Sauce Cafe our residence 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:30.970
 He always arranges a stew buffet for you 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:33.909
 and an hour or half past eleven 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:36.340
 two in oldenzaal got the advantage 

00:03:33.909 --> 00:03:38.349
 wants groups a stew buffet that is 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:39.700
 It is always very well arranged that they we 5 

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:41.049
 euro hairstyle 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:43.090
 I think we can conclude 

00:03:41.049 --> 00:03:45.010
 come if you work out what I can do 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:46.719
 if or ask for an actual cost 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:48.639
 We have no more tasks 

00:03:46.719 --> 00:03:50.409
 overijssel 

00:03:48.639 --> 00:03:52.120
 Lakeman good conclusion to you indeed 

00:03:50.409 --> 00:03:53.470
 and especially without sponsoring things like that 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:57.299
 no honor to save association in twente 

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:57.299
 to get a wagon street at all
