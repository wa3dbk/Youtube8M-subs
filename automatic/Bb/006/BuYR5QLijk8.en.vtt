00:00:09.699 --> 00:00:13.019
 The textures of our blog will be made without the winner 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:15.009
 have created 

00:00:15.009 --> 00:00:17.990
 in the back are from the MCG 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:19.769
 find the folder 

00:00:19.769 --> 00:00:21.230
 my Kreft 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:24.400
 and then Terra Point PNG 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:26.439
 the copies would be 

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:28.789
 go back to the main directory 

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:30.720
 and then deliver in the places 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.240
 my Kreft 

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:33.960
 and paste there 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.430
 Dieter Rapp and PNG 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:40.850
 Under no circumstances will the construction work be done with Paint on my behalf with Pan Radio Network 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:43.850
 Photoshop or not to go on the net 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:57.680
 so far numbers who so first to count the textures 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:59.990
 this is "text 2 0» 

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:05.890
 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.510
 11 12 13 14 15 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:13.400
 16 17 18 19 and so on 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.790
 important is that the first text is 2 0 and from then on it will just be in rows 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:18.390
 counted 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.670
 here measures 6 4 1 uses the stone 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:25.780
 we are now doing our one texture and adding a spoon to this song 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:28.900
 We can take all others, but we have to have a lot of cells 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:31.890
 that is still 30 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.280
 so 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.460
 such a texture is if you do not use Thatcher way or so 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.460
 16 by 16 pixels by default 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:46.630
 I'm typing arbor I just add a different texture 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:50.010
 it works like me 

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:53.010
 now this 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:58.340
 Füglister EHC again and aim the copy into the project's animals 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:01.660
 that's exactly my way 

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:05.180
 that can work now, says a professional describes great 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:08.180
 Letters needed big he or something 

00:02:11.759 --> 00:02:14.980
 just to show that now seconds 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:17.980
 a new textures 

00:02:30.429 --> 00:02:34.359
 I believe that needs to be able to recognize we are in need of this 

00:02:34.359 --> 00:02:35.159
 block 

00:02:35.159 --> 00:02:38.449
 page 

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:41.449
 yes, opera side when in big around believe again 

00:02:42.129 --> 00:02:44.809
 we save that with 

00:02:44.809 --> 00:02:47.809
 visible export to the club at the federal government 

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:53.419
 The man Dieter Welp and BMW are not sent out of the password and are now 

00:02:53.419 --> 00:02:55.069
 unfortunately not 

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:58.349
 Solz children out 

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:02.219
 we do not have to re-IPCom Palmer not changed to the code now 

00:03:02.219 --> 00:03:05.219
 and allow simple little to the test 

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:13.039
 Euro 

00:03:13.039 --> 00:03:16.039
 Area we have forgotten 

00:03:18.219 --> 00:03:21.219
 we have programmed as for the block 

00:03:23.029 --> 00:03:25.209
 in the block-point we have 

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:28.349
 awarded the stone texture 

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:32.569
 I'll change that yet I can now write 1 2 30 percent so I write here 

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:34.529
 a 30 years 

00:03:34.529 --> 00:03:36.779
 Data evaluates com a space 

00:03:36.779 --> 00:03:38.639
 the textures 

00:03:38.639 --> 00:03:42.379
 I can save but now I have changed something on the cut and must 

00:03:43.379 --> 00:03:46.379
 how to arrive 

00:03:51.339 --> 00:03:53.519
 investigated 

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:56.519
 instead of client 

00:03:58.049 --> 00:04:01.069
 Hungen TR tests 

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:02.399
 our texture 

00:04:02.399 --> 00:04:04.289
 our own texture 

00:04:04.289 --> 00:04:07.289
 with our own light block 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:30.670
 now we see directly when we get a new block so if we have ours 

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:33.669
 Block 9 met 

00:04:34.259 --> 00:04:37.259
 Woller we also see every corner texture in the inventory 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:41.559
 Euro unfortunately you can see here 

00:04:41.559 --> 00:04:45.219
 Mouse over makes Biesemann lecturer and tames nothing here 

00:04:45.819 --> 00:04:48.620
 That's why we'll take care of it next time 

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:50.169
 have fun with your textures
