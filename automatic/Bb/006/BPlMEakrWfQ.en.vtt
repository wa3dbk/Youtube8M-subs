00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:07.980
 Today , it's a bit of a joke, so to speak 

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:11.860
 Bavaria 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:15.600
 I have the new fdm 110 here with me 

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:19.330
 on the water its broken eleven meters long 

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:20.620
 relatively easy for the application areas 

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:23.070
 what the and that he really thought 

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:26.470
 really hard action is with the rod 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:29.470
 meant is a broken course, too 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:30.910
 from teenie because of our team 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:33.190
 of course with teenie tight 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:34.390
 work together especially for 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:36.969
 the German market for the domestic 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:39.300
 Market on the big cards elfmeter 

00:00:36.969 --> 00:00:41.679
 range or on the finow channel 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.749
 Of course, not only for those for 

00:00:41.679 --> 00:00:44.890
 mens of creation, so to speak, but 

00:00:43.749 --> 00:00:45.999
 also for the women or the 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:48.489
 teenagers anyway only with 

00:00:45.999 --> 00:00:51.670
 eleven meters 50 euros is allowed this route 

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:54.190
 Of course, that's an alternative 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:01:00.399
 superteam typical finish a full 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:01:04.379
 very smooth ski otherwise is extremely 

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:05.590
 holland really fast too 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.229
 proportion of 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:10.049
 this enlarged really make it 

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:13.119
 for the hardest task of all tasks 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:15.310
 what else can you say for good there is 

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:16.750
 different kits to route or 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:18.909
 one understands of course to have it 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:20.770
 we will gladly show you in detail 

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:23.680
 what the route came made me now 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:27.549
 a very good impression is very responsive 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:28.060
 fast good as she reacts in the 

00:01:27.549 --> 00:01:29.530
 attack 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:31.270
 today I will not catch fish here 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:33.700
 is pretty easy to put on 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:41.500
 Frozen so you can only today 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:44.200
 let's simulate and is natural 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:45.250
 not the freeway of all free 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.929
 of course, but also makes suspect 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:49.210
 no sense if I want to carp 

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:51.340
 but of course buy the burden 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:53.590
 great that really quite loop 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:55.289
 good ones like evolution for example 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:57.969
 or the 1500 probably now 

00:01:55.289 --> 00:02:01.390
 or the whole new concept 8 

00:01:57.969 --> 00:02:03.189
 to party minute bykov of course always on 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:05.890
 the limit is the route is for 

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:07.509
 harder as I said created there 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:09.369
 I responded to properly retract off 

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:11.830
 relatively fast is not too distant 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:13.720
 Hand has come a quick reaction 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:17.830
 Loose with a hand on fatigue-free 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:19.780
 on the guarantee and above all 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:21.250
 If you say okay I want to 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:22.960
 finally we have over the route with us 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:24.640
 Everyone says they are the best you can 

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:27.430
 here a cheap bargain 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:28.870
 he gave it a cheap good , so to speak 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:31.120
 beginners but also for 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:33.970
 the one who says it is enough for me 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:35.770
 eleven meters 50 people a route then 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:37.920
 Of course I can do that here 

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:41.440
 can also beat sideways 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:42.970
 stop me, so let's do it 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:47.680
 see how they react is actually 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:49.930
 quickly back in the center, of course, too 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:53.190
 with strong lifting I can the route 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:53.190
 control well
