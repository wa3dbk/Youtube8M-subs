00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:04.520
 Y 

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:14.220
 the first of November meets the first 

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:18.420
 year of living in a rented apartment 

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:20.670
 the owner verbally requested it on 3 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:23.520
 September to avoid it 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.080
 question should you give me the three months to 

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:27.060
 vacate the property from that 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.170
 date or must I deliver before 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:32.390
 meet the year 

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:36.050
 question also from the owner of the 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:38.899
 real estate try to good 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:40.579
 variant of samil the first thing is that 

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:43.129
 when we talk about contracts for 

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:44.949
 urban housing lease or 

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:50.769
 housing or real estate to live 

00:00:44.949 --> 00:00:53.780
 we must be governed by law 820 of 2003 

00:00:50.769 --> 00:00:57.210
 and if you see the norm I will come 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:01:00.590
 here and I have it 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.590
 and you can show it 

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:10.289
 article 21 we will go to see if you guys 

00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:10.289
 they reach to read the screen 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.930
 Article 21 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:16.220
 Well, if you can not read, I'm going to 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:18.920
 do 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:21.590
 Article 21 termination of the contract of 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:24.350
 lease then sad article 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:26.200
 22 termination by the landlord 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:28.820
 and they are causal for the landlord 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:30.110
 may unilaterally request 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:32.090
 termination of the contract in the 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:34.400
 following as he speaks a series of 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:36.560
 as in the non-cancellation of 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:40.100
 the lease payments the non-payment of 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:42.590
 public services sublet to affect 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:45.619
 the tranquility of the neighbors to do 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:48.050
 improvements without permission to violate the 

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:50.300
 horizontal property regulation and 

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:52.250
 the cause comes to the seventh says the 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:54.380
 landlord may terminate 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:57.800
 unilaterally the contract during the 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:59.720
 doors or extensions notice by 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:02.110
 written aimed at portraying me through 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:05.350
 of the postal service 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:07.580
 asking by invoking the respective cause 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:11.100
 of restitution 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:14.820
 in advance no less 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:17.340
 to three months or in advance not 

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:19.290
 less than three months and the payment of one 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:22.050
 compensation equivalent to the price of 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:24.240
 three months of leasing is that way where 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:26.430
 many say ready before there were three 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:28.050
 free months because I still have to 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:30.270
 pay but first I also have to 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:33.780
 pay that session of popularly the 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:35.970
 people say or they just give me three 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:38.910
 free months correct by the figure of 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:41.430
 the compensation but I repeat the numeral 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:45.390
 third of article 22 of the code of the 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:48.300
 Law 820 of 2003 is telling us in the 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:50.430
 extensions of the lease 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:52.860
 that there is the cascarita then 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:56.950
 let's move on 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:59.230
 the eighth numeral that that's something else and 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:01.360
 says the eighth the landlord can give 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:04.030
 by unilaterally terminated the 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:08.580
 lease agreement at the date of the 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:08.580
 expiration of the initial term 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:14.959
 initial or its extensions when it 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:18.019
 present the following causes 

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:20.629
 obviously invoking three months before 

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:22.910
 the respective expiration date of the 

00:03:20.629 --> 00:03:25.730
 initial period or extension and it brings me 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:28.150
 other causes than those 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:31.489
 previous I will tell you that in the previous 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:34.280
 there is reciprocal compensation in this 

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:35.930
 octave onwards there is no payment of 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:38.330
 compensation by the landlord 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:40.099
 towards the tenant and one of those 

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:42.849
 causal is when the owner 

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:46.010
 you need to occupy the property to live 

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:48.049
 more than a year in him when he needs 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:51.079
 make repairs and it is required 

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:53.569
 unoccupied when I must deliver it 

00:03:51.079 --> 00:03:56.700
 obligations of a sales contract that 

00:03:53.569 --> 00:04:02.310
 have done etcetera then 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:04.500
 well as article 22 of law 820 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:07.610
 of 2003 

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:11.070
 makes reference to some first causal 

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:14.220
 eye in the period of the extensions and there are 

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:17.340
 other causes for when it is at 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:20.310
 expiration of the part or expiration 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:22.140
 of the initial period or the expiration of 

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:24.360
 the extensions always with three months 

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:26.490
 before but in the second situation there 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:28.590
 There is compensation payment if the 

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:30.840
 minimum notice of three months but no 

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:32.910
 there is compensation payment is in the case 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:36.990
 of those of the question that makes us Maria 

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:39.780
 tereza galeano in envigado says 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:42.390
 that your contract ends the first year 

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:44.460
 barely ends on the first of November and 

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:48.600
 his pro and the owner tell him 

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:50.730
 verbally first verbally error the 

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:53.250
 September 3 they needed 

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:55.530
 real estate to avoid them all September 

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:58.950
 all October to the first of November 

00:04:55.530 --> 00:05:01.890
 just two months there is just 60 days 

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:03.510
 and the standard speaks to us of three months and 

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:06.420
 here they only reviewed him with two 

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:09.240
 months of correct anticipation and out 

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:11.310
 of that they started verbally and not by 

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:12.750
 written then it's as if you do not 

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:14.460
 they would have done and you could 

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:17.370
 perfectly reach the first of 

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:20.160
 November and consider that your contract 

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:23.310
 automatically but but the phenomenon of 

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:26.100
 the automatic extension so simple and 

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:28.440
 and regulated by what it establishes 

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:29.760
 then Article 22 and that is that it has 

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:31.680
 to take advantage of three months before 

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:33.150
 expiration of the extension because if the 

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:34.800
 they will take out before the date of 

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:36.870
 expiration of the extension of the first 

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:40.200
 year or in the second year you are there 

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:42.000
 if they have to indemnify ok in this 

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:43.200
 case also because you have not been 

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.240
 warned 

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:47.580
 I do not even have to go 

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:51.240
 I recommend reading very 

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:54.380
 Calm of Article 22 of Law 820 of 

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:54.380
 2003 ok
