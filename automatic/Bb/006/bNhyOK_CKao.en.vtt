hey folks to make a turbo be here I'm
just<00:00:04.020> going<00:00:04.290> to<00:00:04.470> cover<00:00:04.680> in<00:00:05.009> this<00:00:05.100> mini<00:00:05.339> video

00:00:05.539 --> 00:00:05.549 
just going to cover in this mini video

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:09.410 
just going to cover in this mini video
the<00:00:06.299> extras<00:00:06.660> one<00:00:07.010> during<00:00:08.010> simulated<00:00:08.880> camping

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:09.420 
the extras one during simulated camping

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.350 
the extras one during simulated camping
usage<00:00:09.780> I<00:00:10.769> say<00:00:11.639> simulator<00:00:12.120> I'm<00:00:12.179> actually

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
usage I say simulator I'm actually

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.259 
usage I say simulator I'm actually
camping<00:00:12.780> but<00:00:13.219> you<00:00:14.219> know<00:00:14.340> I<00:00:14.580> can't<00:00:14.940> possibly

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
camping but you know I can't possibly

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:17.060 
camping but you know I can't possibly
cover<00:00:15.480> every<00:00:15.870> single<00:00:16.020> scenario<00:00:16.320> that<00:00:16.710> one<00:00:16.920> may

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
cover every single scenario that one may

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.490 
cover every single scenario that one may
potentially<00:00:17.550> use<00:00:17.789> a<00:00:17.820> light<00:00:18.090> board<00:00:18.390> so<00:00:19.080> in<00:00:19.380> this

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
potentially use a light board so in this

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.109 
potentially use a light board so in this
one<00:00:19.740> again<00:00:19.890> that's<00:00:20.400> what<00:00:20.550> the<00:00:20.640> other<00:00:20.760> video<00:00:21.029> is

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
one again that's what the other video is

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:22.730 
one again that's what the other video is
just<00:00:21.210> give<00:00:21.600> you<00:00:21.689> a<00:00:21.720> rough<00:00:21.900> idea<00:00:22.050> of<00:00:22.320> how<00:00:22.529> we

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
just give you a rough idea of how we

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.859 
just give you a rough idea of how we
feel<00:00:23.070> like<00:00:23.220> to<00:00:23.850> use<00:00:24.000> a<00:00:24.029> flashlight<00:00:24.359> in<00:00:24.720> lieu<00:00:24.840> of

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
feel like to use a flashlight in lieu of

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:27.230 
feel like to use a flashlight in lieu of
a<00:00:25.080> headline<00:00:25.289> so<00:00:25.650> with<00:00:25.800> that<00:00:25.890> said<00:00:26.130> get<00:00:27.029> shut

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
a headline so with that said get shut

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.220 
a headline so with that said get shut
off<00:00:27.269> the<00:00:27.570> letters<00:00:28.199> at<00:00:28.500> age<00:00:28.619> 7<00:00:29.240> and<00:00:30.240> crab<00:00:30.720> ps1

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.620 
off the letters at age 7 and crab ps1
put<00:00:31.740> into<00:00:31.949> preset<00:00:32.369> mode<00:00:32.520> which<00:00:32.759> I<00:00:32.910> had<00:00:33.090> set<00:00:33.420> to

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
put into preset mode which I had set to

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.459 
put into preset mode which I had set to
the<00:00:33.989> lowest<00:00:34.800> available<00:00:35.219> setting<00:00:35.790> and<00:00:36.480> as<00:00:37.380> you

the lowest available setting and as you

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:40.670 
the lowest available setting and as you
can<00:00:37.590> see<00:00:37.620> wow<00:00:37.980> that's<00:00:38.399> a<00:00:38.640> wee<00:00:39.210> bit<00:00:39.570> bright<00:00:39.870> for

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
can see wow that's a wee bit bright for

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.720 
can see wow that's a wee bit bright for
dr.<00:00:41.340> depth<00:00:41.550> eyes<00:00:41.820> use<00:00:42.300> I<00:00:43.250> look<00:00:44.250> around<00:00:44.399> for

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
dr. depth eyes use I look around for

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.260 
dr. depth eyes use I look around for
something<00:00:44.910> around<00:00:45.090> the<00:00:45.300> tent<00:00:45.570> I<00:00:47.239> shine<00:00:48.239> a

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
something around the tent I shine a

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.900 
something around the tent I shine a
little<00:00:48.510> lower<00:00:48.780> because<00:00:49.110> I<00:00:49.200> do<00:00:49.260> have<00:00:49.910> people

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
little lower because I do have people

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.510 
little lower because I do have people
around<00:00:51.180> me<00:00:51.360> don't<00:00:51.539> want<00:00:51.870> to<00:00:52.050> shine<00:00:53.039> into<00:00:53.370> their

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
around me don't want to shine into their

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.900 
around me don't want to shine into their
tents<00:00:53.960> considering<00:00:54.960> how<00:00:55.079> bright<00:00:55.350> this<00:00:55.530> is<00:00:55.910> ok

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
tents considering how bright this is ok

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.150 
tents considering how bright this is ok
so<00:00:57.210> with<00:00:57.360> that<00:00:57.480> said<00:00:57.780> let's<00:00:58.500> go<00:00:58.710> ahead<00:00:58.770> and<00:00:58.980> get

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
so with that said let's go ahead and get

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:10.910 
so with that said let's go ahead and get
out<00:00:59.340> on<00:00:59.489> the<00:00:59.579> train

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:17.430 

alright<00:01:11.920> so

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:17.440 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:23.280 

I<00:01:19.620> guess<00:01:20.620> similar<00:01:20.860> to<00:01:21.220> the<00:01:21.460> tn31<00:01:22.120> there<00:01:23.080> is<00:01:23.260> a

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:23.290 
I guess similar to the tn31 there is a

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:26.670 
I guess similar to the tn31 there is a
pretty<00:01:23.770> intense<00:01:23.860> hot<00:01:24.340> spot<00:01:25.650> with<00:01:26.650> a

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:26.680 
pretty intense hot spot with a

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:30.210 
pretty intense hot spot with a
transition<00:01:27.280> to<00:01:27.520> the<00:01:28.140> spill<00:01:29.140> but<00:01:29.410> not<00:01:29.680> as<00:01:29.920> bad

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:30.220 
transition to the spill but not as bad

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:33.510 
transition to the spill but not as bad
as<00:01:30.250> the<00:01:30.850> tea<00:01:31.330> and<00:01:31.450> 31<00:01:31.870> so<00:01:32.140> with<00:01:32.950> that<00:01:33.040> said<00:01:33.310> this

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:33.520 
as the tea and 31 so with that said this

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:34.920 
as the tea and 31 so with that said this
is<00:01:33.670> a<00:01:33.790> little<00:01:34.060> clearing<00:01:34.360> right<00:01:34.510> before<00:01:34.840> the

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:34.930 
is a little clearing right before the

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:36.990 
is a little clearing right before the
path<00:01:35.190> I'm<00:01:36.190> going<00:01:36.310> to<00:01:36.370> use<00:01:36.520> this<00:01:36.670> one-handed

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:37.000 
path I'm going to use this one-handed

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:44.520 
path I'm going to use this one-handed
popped<00:01:37.750> up<00:01:37.960> into<00:01:38.170> full<00:01:38.470> mode<00:01:38.790> okay<00:01:43.110> and<00:01:44.110> start

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:44.530 
popped up into full mode okay and start

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:45.990 
popped up into full mode okay and start
put<00:01:44.770> it<00:01:44.860> back<00:01:45.010> into<00:01:45.160> the<00:01:45.280> low<00:01:45.640> mode<00:01:45.880> to

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:46.000 
put it back into the low mode to

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:53.640 
put it back into the low mode to
navigate<00:01:46.450> the<00:01:46.540> trail<00:01:46.810> again<00:01:52.320> even<00:01:53.320> the<00:01:53.530> lowest

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:53.650 
navigate the trail again even the lowest

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:56.930 
navigate the trail again even the lowest
mode<00:01:53.950> probably<00:01:54.430> a<00:01:54.460> little<00:01:54.640> bit<00:01:54.820> overkill<00:01:55.300> for

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:56.940 
mode probably a little bit overkill for

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:02.430 
mode probably a little bit overkill for
dark-adapted<00:01:57.940> eyes<00:01:58.420> but<00:01:58.810> I<00:02:01.020> stick<00:02:02.020> is<00:02:02.260> your

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:02.440 
dark-adapted eyes but I stick is your

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:05.880 
dark-adapted eyes but I stick is your
idea<00:02:02.740> what<00:02:03.310> it<00:02:03.400> feels<00:02:03.430> like<00:02:03.700> in<00:02:03.820> actual<00:02:04.330> use<00:02:04.890> so

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:05.890 
idea what it feels like in actual use so

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:09.690 
idea what it feels like in actual use so
coming<00:02:06.280> to<00:02:06.430> the<00:02:06.640> clearing<00:02:06.850> again<00:02:08.280> to<00:02:09.280> that

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:09.700 
coming to the clearing again to that

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:12.540 
coming to the clearing again to that
tree<00:02:10.440> where<00:02:11.440> I<00:02:11.470> took<00:02:11.530> the<00:02:11.710> beam<00:02:11.860> shots<00:02:12.100> at<00:02:12.250> 40

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:12.550 
tree where I took the beam shots at 40

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:15.330 
tree where I took the beam shots at 40
feet<00:02:13.110> that's<00:02:14.110> the<00:02:14.530> trees<00:02:14.890> off<00:02:15.100> in<00:02:15.250> the

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:15.340 
feet that's the trees off in the

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:17.240 
feet that's the trees off in the
distance<00:02:15.520> so<00:02:15.910> even<00:02:16.180> on<00:02:16.270> the<00:02:16.360> lowest<00:02:16.660> mode

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
distance so even on the lowest mode

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.980 
distance so even on the lowest mode
pretty<00:02:18.250> decent<00:02:18.400> throw<00:02:18.820> on<00:02:18.970> this<00:02:19.150> guy<00:02:19.330> that<00:02:19.870> I

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:19.990 
pretty decent throw on this guy that I

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:22.020 
pretty decent throw on this guy that I
could<00:02:20.140> actually<00:02:20.290> get<00:02:20.560> there<00:02:20.800> now<00:02:21.610> bump<00:02:21.910> this

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030 
could actually get there now bump this

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
could actually get there now bump this
up<00:02:22.180> to<00:02:22.360> the<00:02:22.450> highest<00:02:22.630> mode<00:02:25.890> okay<00:02:26.890> so<00:02:27.810> this<00:02:28.810> is

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:29.050 
up to the highest mode okay so this is

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:31.170 
up to the highest mode okay so this is
probably<00:02:29.350> actually<00:02:29.680> a<00:02:30.250> bit<00:02:30.670> brighter<00:02:30.910> than

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:31.180 
probably actually a bit brighter than

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:34.380 
probably actually a bit brighter than
what<00:02:31.540> I'm<00:02:31.690> seeing<00:02:32.020> in<00:02:32.140> real<00:02:32.290> life<00:02:33.330> there<00:02:34.330> is

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.390 
what I'm seeing in real life there is

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:36.240 
what I'm seeing in real life there is
still<00:02:34.720> a<00:02:34.750> little<00:02:34.989> bit<00:02:35.170> miss<00:02:35.380> going<00:02:35.830> on<00:02:35.980> so

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.250 
still a little bit miss going on so

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:37.680 
still a little bit miss going on so
perhaps<00:02:36.489> that's<00:02:36.790> a<00:02:37.000> little<00:02:37.180> bit<00:02:37.300> feedback

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:37.690 
perhaps that's a little bit feedback

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:40.380 
perhaps that's a little bit feedback
into<00:02:38.050> the<00:02:38.800> camera<00:02:39.040> but<00:02:39.400> going<00:02:40.120> to<00:02:40.180> go<00:02:40.300> ahead

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:40.390 
into the camera but going to go ahead

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:42.090 
into the camera but going to go ahead
and<00:02:40.630> shine<00:02:40.870> it<00:02:41.050> up<00:02:41.170> there<00:02:41.470> at<00:02:41.590> the<00:02:41.650> top<00:02:41.739> of<00:02:41.950> the

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:42.100 
and shine it up there at the top of the

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:49.840 
and shine it up there at the top of the
trees<00:02:45.360> shine<00:02:46.360> around

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:49.850 

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:52.960 

little<00:02:50.570> wee<00:02:50.690> bit<00:02:50.900> bright<00:02:51.370> so<00:02:52.370> my<00:02:52.490> bumpit<00:02:52.850> back

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:52.970 
little wee bit bright so my bumpit back

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:57.360 
little wee bit bright so my bumpit back
down

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:57.370 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:59.200 

ok

00:02:59.200 --> 00:02:59.210 
ok

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:02.590 
ok
get<00:02:59.930> back<00:03:00.050> onto<00:03:00.230> the<00:03:00.440> trail<00:03:01.120> so<00:03:02.120> the<00:03:02.240> flogging

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:02.600 
get back onto the trail so the flogging

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:04.300 
get back onto the trail so the flogging
profile<00:03:02.930> allows<00:03:03.080> me<00:03:03.320> to<00:03:03.410> easily<00:03:03.470> see<00:03:03.950> the

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:04.310 
profile allows me to easily see the

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:07.870 
profile allows me to easily see the
entire<00:03:04.580> path<00:03:04.850> but<00:03:05.120> again<00:03:06.010> the<00:03:07.010> hotspot<00:03:07.640> is

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:07.880 
entire path but again the hotspot is

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:14.590 
entire path but again the hotspot is
potentially<00:03:08.750> a<00:03:08.990> little<00:03:09.950> bit<00:03:13.360> bright<00:03:14.360> and

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:14.600 
potentially a little bit bright and

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:18.670 
potentially a little bit bright and
intense<00:03:15.370> versus<00:03:16.370> the<00:03:16.580> spill<00:03:16.930> but<00:03:17.930> since<00:03:18.470> this

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:18.680 
intense versus the spill but since this

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:21.970 
intense versus the spill but since this
is<00:03:18.860> the<00:03:18.890> lower<00:03:19.220> setting<00:03:19.700> you<00:03:20.060> can<00:03:20.090> go<00:03:20.980> one

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:21.980 
is the lower setting you can go one

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:30.030 
is the lower setting you can go one
would<00:03:22.160> just<00:03:22.370> simply<00:03:22.520> have<00:03:22.820> to<00:03:22.940> deal<00:03:23.120> with<00:03:23.240> it<00:03:23.420> a

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:30.040 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:34.480 

little<00:03:31.040> clearer<00:03:31.430> in<00:03:31.550> here<00:03:32.920> get<00:03:33.920> back<00:03:34.070> on<00:03:34.250> to

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:34.490 
little clearer in here get back on to

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:43.940 
little clearer in here get back on to
this<00:03:34.670> little<00:03:34.730> tree<00:03:35.320> and<00:03:36.320> back<00:03:36.500> to<00:03:36.710> the<00:03:36.830> tent

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:43.950 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:46.760 

so<00:03:44.640> that's<00:03:44.970> the<00:03:45.090> thing<00:03:45.270> just<00:03:45.540> has<00:03:45.750> a<00:03:46.050> very<00:03:46.440> very

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:46.770 
so that's the thing just has a very very

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:49.250 
so that's the thing just has a very very
wiping<00:03:47.250> profile<00:03:47.670> and<00:03:47.849> still<00:03:48.090> pretty<00:03:48.840> bite<00:03:49.019> so

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:49.260 
wiping profile and still pretty bite so

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.350 
wiping profile and still pretty bite so
one<00:03:49.440> would<00:03:49.590> need<00:03:49.739> to<00:03:49.860> be<00:03:49.980> mindful<00:03:50.300> not<00:03:51.300> to

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:51.360 
one would need to be mindful not to

00:03:51.360 --> 00:04:01.220 
one would need to be mindful not to
shine<00:03:52.140> into<00:03:52.470> other<00:03:52.620> people's<00:03:53.010> tents

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:01.230 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:08.809 

headed<00:04:02.040> back<00:04:02.220> to<00:04:02.370> the<00:04:02.400> tent<00:04:02.760> I<00:04:07.819> guess

00:04:08.809 --> 00:04:08.819 
headed back to the tent I guess

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:12.440 
headed back to the tent I guess
potential<00:04:09.420> use<00:04:09.629> to<00:04:09.930> set<00:04:10.230> up<00:04:10.319> your<00:04:11.150> tent<00:04:12.150> but

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:12.450 
potential use to set up your tent but

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:19.370 
potential use to set up your tent but
again<00:04:12.690> fairly<00:04:13.409> fairly<00:04:13.769> bright<00:04:16.790> alright<00:04:18.380> let's

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:19.380 
again fairly fairly bright alright let's

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:24.530 
again fairly fairly bright alright let's
come<00:04:19.560> back<00:04:19.680> inside<00:04:19.979> the<00:04:20.250> tent<00:04:23.030> one<00:04:24.030> more<00:04:24.240> final

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:24.540 
come back inside the tent one more final

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:31.990 
come back inside the tent one more final
pass<00:04:24.720> around<00:04:25.020> the<00:04:25.199> tent

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:32.000 

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.200 

ok

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:34.210 
ok

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:37.380 
ok
and<00:04:34.780> that<00:04:35.139> causes
