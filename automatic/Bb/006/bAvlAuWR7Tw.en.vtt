can't<00:00:49.950> really<00:00:50.010> see<00:00:50.370> it<00:00:50.399> on<00:00:50.520> her<00:00:50.700> character

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.299 
can't really see it on her character
here<00:00:51.360> but<00:00:52.199> that's<00:00:52.559> probably<00:00:52.860> for<00:00:53.070> the<00:00:53.100> better

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
here but that's probably for the better

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:58.299 
here but that's probably for the better
so<00:00:55.699> yeah<00:00:56.699> obviously<00:00:57.239> that's<00:00:57.719> why<00:00:57.870> I<00:00:57.899> have

00:00:58.299 --> 00:00:58.309 
so yeah obviously that's why I have

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:00.170 
so yeah obviously that's why I have
Supergirl<00:00:59.309> in<00:00:59.460> the<00:00:59.550> background<00:01:00.059> because

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
Supergirl in the background because

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.060 
Supergirl in the background because
they're<00:01:00.449> essentially<00:01:01.050> the<00:01:01.289> same<00:01:01.800> character

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:04.070
