and what can we do to make them more
comfortable<00:06:23.530> and<00:06:24.630> often<00:06:25.630> you<00:06:26.530> know<00:06:26.650> just

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:26.950 
comfortable and often you know just

00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:29.160 
comfortable and often you know just

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:32.620 
hand or padding underneath is a much

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:35.520 
hand or padding underneath is a much
friendlier<00:06:32.950> approach<00:06:33.670> and<00:06:34.660> when<00:06:34.810> I<00:06:34.870> over<00:06:35.440> the

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:35.530 
friendlier approach and when I over the

00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:37.800 
friendlier approach and when I over the
years<00:06:35.710> the<00:06:35.980> more<00:06:36.130> I<00:06:36.160> know<00:06:36.370> the<00:06:36.550> more<00:06:36.790> I<00:06:36.970> go<00:06:37.270> when

years the more I know the more I go when

00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:39.480 
years the more I know the more I go when
I<00:06:37.900> see<00:06:38.080> dogs<00:06:38.290> I<00:06:38.440> usually<00:06:38.710> ask<00:06:38.830> if<00:06:39.040> I<00:06:39.130> can<00:06:39.190> pet

00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:43.380 
them and I'll say I hope I hand out like
this<00:06:41.920> and<00:06:42.190> it's<00:06:42.640> a<00:06:42.700> dog<00:06:42.880> that's<00:06:43.060> not<00:06:43.180> coming

to be pet the dog who do will come right
in<00:06:47.820> it's<00:06:48.820> surprising<00:06:48.910> how<00:06:49.420> many<00:06:49.480> don't<00:06:49.960> want

00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:50.110
