00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:18.390 
really can't go wrong this is more like

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:20.390 
really can't go wrong this is more like
cut<00:03:19.020> the<00:03:19.170> rope<00:03:19.410> where<00:03:19.770> it<00:03:19.860> has<00:03:20.010> really<00:03:20.190> nice

animations<00:03:21.000> it's<00:03:21.209> not<00:03:21.360> very<00:03:21.450> straightforward

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.260 
animations it's not very straightforward

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:23.720 
animations it's not very straightforward

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:23.730 
because of all the animations and how

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:25.820 
because of all the animations and how
long<00:03:23.910> it<00:03:24.180> takes<00:03:24.420> again<00:03:24.690> into<00:03:24.959> the<00:03:24.990> game<00:03:25.260> but

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:25.830 
long it takes again into the game but

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:30.230
