longevity<00:01:37.790> make<00:01:38.510> it<00:01:38.600> nice<00:01:38.780> and<00:01:38.810> robust<00:01:39.320> so

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:39.740 
longevity make it nice and robust so

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:42.010 
longevity make it nice and robust so
it's<00:01:39.890> not<00:01:40.100> going<00:01:40.250> to<00:01:40.340> work<00:01:40.970> through<00:01:41.420> anytime

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:42.020 
it's not going to work through anytime

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:44.710 
it's not going to work through anytime
soon<00:01:42.530> ok<00:01:42.920> the<00:01:43.400> suit<00:01:43.640> is<00:01:43.700> stitched<00:01:44.060> and<00:01:44.330> glued

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:44.720 
soon ok the suit is stitched and glued

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:46.840 
soon ok the suit is stitched and glued
and<00:01:44.990> on<00:01:45.500> the<00:01:45.620> other<00:01:45.710> side<00:01:45.980> okay<00:01:46.580> which

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:46.850 
and on the other side okay which

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:48.280 
and on the other side okay which
prevents<00:01:47.360> any<00:01:47.480> water<00:01:47.720> getting<00:01:47.990> through<00:01:48.170> the

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:48.290 
prevents any water getting through the

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:49.720 
prevents any water getting through the
seams<00:01:48.500> it's<00:01:48.680> called<00:01:48.860> gluten<00:01:49.130> blind<00:01:49.340> stitching

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:49.730 
seams it's called gluten blind stitching

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:51.700 
seams it's called gluten blind stitching
it's<00:01:50.150> then<00:01:50.270> double<00:01:50.630> stitched<00:01:50.900> and<00:01:51.140> you<00:01:51.560> get

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:51.710 
it's then double stitched and you get

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:53.350 
it's then double stitched and you get
the<00:01:51.770> liquid<00:01:52.100> taping<00:01:52.310> over<00:01:52.490> the<00:01:52.700> seams<00:01:52.940> as<00:01:53.150> well

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:53.360 
the liquid taping over the seams as well

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:55.540 
the liquid taping over the seams as well
so<00:01:53.930> they're<00:01:54.320> reinforced<00:01:54.920> in<00:01:55.070> every<00:01:55.310> possible

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:55.550 
so they're reinforced in every possible

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:57.400 
so they're reinforced in every possible
way<00:01:55.880> vaccine<00:01:56.450> change<00:01:56.660> to<00:01:56.780> stop<00:01:57.020> the<00:01:57.200> seams

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:57.410 
way vaccine change to stop the seams

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:59.260 
way vaccine change to stop the seams
wearing<00:01:57.740> through<00:01:57.980> it's<00:01:58.490> also<00:01:58.670> stopped<00:01:59.060> in

00:01:59.260 --> 00:01:59.270 
wearing through it's also stopped in

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:01.030 
wearing through it's also stopped in
water<00:01:59.570> getting<00:01:59.900> to<00:01:59.990> the<00:02:00.110> suit<00:02:00.320> so<00:02:00.830> you<00:02:00.890> can

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:01.040 
water getting to the suit so you can

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:02.800 
water getting to the suit so you can
imagine<00:02:01.130> the<00:02:01.550> only<00:02:01.790> areas<00:02:02.180> that<00:02:02.330> suit<00:02:02.540> is

00:05:59.300 --> 00:05:59.310 
more strength and durability I mean that

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:00.710 
more strength and durability I mean that
nothing<00:05:59.730> is<00:05:59.820> getting<00:05:59.970> through<00:06:00.090> those<00:06:00.390> scenes
