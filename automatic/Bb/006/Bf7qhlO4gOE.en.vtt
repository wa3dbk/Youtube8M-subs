00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:18.910 
some of them more like this how to

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:21.840

choose which one I would really use that

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:29.070 
choose which one I would really use that
is<00:05:22.830> very<00:05:23.830> difficult<00:05:24.070> to<00:05:24.370> know<00:05:27.780> but<00:05:28.780> yeah

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:29.080 
is very difficult to know but yeah

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:31.320 
is very difficult to know but yeah
another<00:05:29.860> super<00:05:30.310> fan<00:05:30.460> of<00:05:30.610> orange<00:05:30.940> but<00:05:31.180> I<00:05:31.210> do

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:31.330 
another super fan of orange but I do

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:34.470 
another super fan of orange but I do
tend<00:05:31.750> to<00:05:31.840> use<00:05:32.080> orange<00:05:32.820> unless<00:05:33.820> on<00:05:34.030> a<00:05:34.060> fair<00:05:34.330> bit

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:34.480 
tend to use orange unless on a fair bit

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:36.180 
tend to use orange unless on a fair bit
I<00:05:34.690> think<00:05:35.020> because<00:05:35.140> I<00:05:35.320> can<00:05:35.500> get<00:05:35.650> away<00:05:35.740> with<00:05:35.980> in

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:36.190 
I think because I can get away with in

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:43.110 
I think because I can get away with in
like<00:05:36.660> adding<00:05:37.660> some<00:05:37.900> tonal<00:05:38.380> pinks<00:05:41.910> well<00:05:42.910> that's

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:43.120 
like adding some tonal pinks well that's

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:46.740 
like adding some tonal pinks well that's
cute<00:05:44.670> but<00:05:45.670> these<00:05:45.880> will<00:05:46.030> all<00:05:46.180> be<00:05:46.300> handy<00:05:46.720> for

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:46.750 
cute but these will all be handy for

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:50.580 
cute but these will all be handy for
just<00:05:47.260> doing<00:05:48.070> some<00:05:48.310> journaling<00:05:48.700> and<00:05:49.630> having

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:50.590 
just doing some journaling and having

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:53.550 
just doing some journaling and having
them<00:05:50.680> cut<00:05:50.950> out<00:05:50.980> like<00:05:51.250> this<00:05:51.600> though<00:05:52.600> I<00:05:52.840> suppose

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:53.560 
them cut out like this though I suppose

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:56.550 
them cut out like this though I suppose
this<00:05:53.830> is<00:05:53.860> the<00:05:54.010> advantage<00:05:54.490> of<00:05:54.960> using<00:05:55.960> proper

00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:56.560 
this is the advantage of using proper

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:01.540 
using pattern paper is your like these

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:04.500 
using pattern paper is your like these
borders<00:06:02.050> and<00:06:02.320> things<00:06:02.470> like<00:06:02.620> this<00:06:03.510> leather

pattern paper which I feel did feel that
I<00:06:21.520> was<00:06:21.550> lacking<00:06:22.000> a<00:06:22.240> little<00:06:22.360> bit<00:06:23.490> so<00:06:24.490> these<00:06:24.790> are

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:24.850 
I was lacking a little bit so these are

00:06:42.730 --> 00:06:46.560 
of having to go and use another piece of
equipment<00:06:44.550> it's<00:06:45.550> the<00:06:45.700> reason<00:06:46.000> why<00:06:46.090> my<00:06:46.210> cricket

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:46.570 
equipment it's the reason why my cricket

00:06:46.570 --> 00:06:48.380 
equipment it's the reason why my cricket
doesn't<00:06:46.660> get<00:06:46.930> used<00:06:47.080> as<00:06:47.320> much<00:06:47.470> as<00:06:47.650> it<00:06:47.800> should

00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:48.390 
doesn't get used as much as it should

00:06:48.390 --> 00:06:56.340 
doesn't get used as much as it should
that's<00:06:49.390> really<00:06:49.720> nice<00:06:52.950> yes<00:06:53.950> because<00:06:54.700> I<00:06:55.200> mean<00:06:56.200> it

00:06:56.340 --> 00:06:56.350 
that's really nice yes because I mean it

00:06:56.350 --> 00:06:59.400 
that's really nice yes because I mean it
gets<00:06:56.560> used<00:06:56.800> a<00:06:56.950> lot<00:06:56.980> if<00:06:57.340> I<00:06:57.690> have<00:06:58.690> just<00:06:59.140> cut<00:06:59.380> a

gets used a lot if I have just cut a
bunch<00:06:59.560> of<00:06:59.740> things<00:06:59.919> out<00:07:00.100> and<00:07:00.310> half<00:07:00.520> a<00:07:00.550> mile<00:07:00.970> ish

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:01.330

00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:08.350 
very much so yeah that's it a hundred

00:07:08.350 --> 00:07:10.950 
very much so yeah that's it a hundred
cards<00:07:08.740> and<00:07:09.390> that's<00:07:10.390> what<00:07:10.600> they've<00:07:10.690> got<00:07:10.810> in

00:07:10.950 --> 00:07:10.960

that<00:07:11.110> the<00:07:11.560> amy<00:07:12.280> tangerine<00:07:12.580> can't<00:07:12.910> paste<00:07:13.210> so<00:07:14.050> I

00:07:14.070 --> 00:07:14.080 
that the amy tangerine can't paste so I

00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:20.520
