00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:06.290
 today we are going to recycle a mobile phone case 

00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:08.990
 putting a hama plate on top of you 

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:11.420
 to do it we're going to need a plate 

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:14.090
 to make square hama is a plate of 

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:16.849
 pinchitos we are going to need also 

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:19.519
 hamas hama beads or hama pearls 

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:22.070
 they are also called hama bits or amateurs or 

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:25.039
 bit bits finally you see many names 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:26.419
 some tapes or I do not use tweezers that 

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:28.429
 You can do perfectly with your finger 

00:00:26.419 --> 00:00:32.239
 because these are never medium and the 

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:33.680
 mobile case we want to recycle what 

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:35.780
 first you have to keep in mind that 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:37.489
 our mobile case fits into the 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:40.309
 hama plate that we have because if not 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:42.320
 we will have to put two together so that the 

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:43.820
 plate size is superior 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:46.670
 good as our mobile carmen a 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:48.620
 let's work only in a square 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:50.019
 well let's take the measure of the mobile 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:52.519
 we started with the ring 

00:00:50.019 --> 00:00:54.079
 Well, we started putting pearls and 

00:00:52.519 --> 00:00:56.089
 you know that pearls have a 

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:57.949
 hole in the center and they are getting 

00:00:56.089 --> 00:01:01.699
 in each of the pinchitos that has 

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:03.500
 the plate then we will raise them and how 

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:04.430
 they melt they stay stuck together 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:06.080
 others 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:08.030
 Well, we started with tweezers 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:11.030
 we continue with the hand you can see 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:12.890
 there is perfectly another hama size 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:14.720
 which is smaller that is more difficult 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:18.020
 Well, we have put 12 is the size 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:22.060
 of the width of our sleeve and the length 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:25.759
 are going to be 26 then we started let's go 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:28.190
 decorating our plate the 12 plate 

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:30.979
 by 26 in different ways putting 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:32.750
 Hamas of different colors let's go 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:36.850
 little by little so that if you want you can 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:36.850
 make the same design to a similar one 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:48.570
 ah 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:30.170
 Well if we finishing line 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:32.490
 our 26 you see how we have been 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:34.440
 now we have to remove the little corner 

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:38.880
 to make a little more rounded the 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:41.250
 songs and make the camera peephole 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:43.290
 of photos the hama once what 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:45.780
 We iron has two faces one that is left 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:49.380
 as more melted and another that is more 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:51.209
 durito more hole if we want to be 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:53.070
 see through the hole we make the hole 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:53.930
 of the camera on the opposite side to that 

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:55.760
 he creates them 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:58.400
 and if we want it to be on the side 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:02.629
 we do it on this good side 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:04.370
 we removed two rows of 46 and now what 

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:07.670
 we have to iron to iron 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:09.620
 to use a paper from this oven that 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:13.219
 Used in pastry, wax paper is called 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:14.989
 also and ironing iron not much 

00:03:13.219 --> 00:03:16.639
 until we see that it starts to melt 

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:18.409
 eye for example we have been 

00:03:16.639 --> 00:03:20.120
 gone a bit in the green part of 

00:03:18.409 --> 00:03:22.010
 down on we have melted too much 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:23.480
 but hey here you see this is the 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:25.909
 side that I say that stays with 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:27.349
 holes and the other is the cast side 

00:03:25.909 --> 00:03:29.329
 for example to cris he likes more always 

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:31.069
 on the other side to me this also me 

00:03:29.329 --> 00:03:32.930
 like very much you see this is another case that 

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:35.540
 we have done and the camera hole 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:37.099
 is on the opposite side good 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:39.859
 now with great sorrow from my heart 

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:41.510
 I'm going to put glue in this sleeve that 

00:03:39.859 --> 00:03:44.569
 I bought in london on a trip I made 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:46.700
 with my sister we had a pipe and 

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:48.260
 Well, it gives me pains but it's that 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:50.419
 poor thing is made dust then if not the 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:53.769
 change I would have to throw it like this is going to 

00:03:50.419 --> 00:03:56.060
 Serve the best for autumn 

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:57.439
 Well, I do not put anything on glue and I'm 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:59.750
 using glue imedio but you can 

00:03:57.439 --> 00:04:02.780
 put any contact glue 

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:04.400
 and you stick the sleeve because it's already 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:08.450
 be careful that you do not 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:10.760
 see in hama on the camera grid and 

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:11.930
 I 'm already putting the phone and see that 

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:13.970
 coolest case I have been 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:16.640
 Well put what you like best and 

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:18.200
 the one on the right or the one on the left to 

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:20.060
 I like them on the left which is the 

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:22.430
 that I used for my mobile because if it has 

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:24.440

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:26.800
