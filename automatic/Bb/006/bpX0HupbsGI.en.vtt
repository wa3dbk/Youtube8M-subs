 rhenium traversed if there is knowledge 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:12.049
 some in a separate kostian 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:17.250
 there is very little to add 

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:20.250
 no knowledge, everything must start from scratch from 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:25.189
 what I wrote to you on the board 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:29.400
 which department allocate a skull 

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:31.880
 further about the brain skull that he has 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:36.469
 there is a base and roof 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:40.100
 the basis internal external internal 

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:42.780
 I already showed and wrote the bases 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:46.280
 has the shape of the 3rd 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:51.930
 skull front pit 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:53.129
 middle back all we have here 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:57.899
 everyone taught 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:01:03.930
 then at any place I will set the pointer 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:07.350
 I'll ask what is in Latin means new 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:11.790
 here it is not entirely new two 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:16.020
 holes that belong not 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:20.729
 single bone and the skull as a whole 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:25.400
 when the bones connected this here 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:32.479
 top hole 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:37.280
 torn faraamom 240 and here's a hole 

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:37.280
 green bullet romance 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:52.060
 from this side of the torn take on and everything 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:56.110
 the rest should know because 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:58.740
 Considered to be taught separately 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:03.550
 bones 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:05.700
 If you look at the skull from the side, that is 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:11.940
 three pits 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:17.890
 that's where my fingers are now temporal 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:21.150
 facade m is it time there is a temporal 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:29.130
 chewing muscle 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:36.900
 this is where my two fingers under the temporal 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:39.510
 photo infra m steam forest here are 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:44.440
 two pterygoids 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:53.739
 chewing muscles are nerves and 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:55.570
 vessels and 3 pit which is more medial then 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:03:02.050
 there is closer to the middle 

00:02:55.570 --> 00:03:12.250
 that's where the end of my pointer will show where 

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:20.680
 the end of my pointer is the wing visible palatine 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:27.400
 fossa of shore force is clearly on 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:30.750
 to know that she had three wall but if so 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:36.190
 the skull is the front wall 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:40.920
 opposite the back wall and medial 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:42.760
 the wall that's where my finger is and 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:50.350
 medial wall 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:53.120
 separates i from the nasal cavity and forms 

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:55.260
 this wall 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:04:02.340
 vertical plastic 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:04:18.090
 palatine bone who saw who forms 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:26.190
 back wall who is sphenoid bone 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:28.380
 but just touch the pterygoid fossa so 

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:31.980
 wing visible obvious 

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:36.000
 guys you cheat sheets do not need to write all 

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:40.490
 said already pterygoid from Russian should 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:43.710
 be like a wall and palatine bone 

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:47.970
 it remains only to see that the front 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:53.419
 wall which bone forms the upper 

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:59.900
 jaw at this hole 5 posts 

00:04:53.419 --> 00:05:04.550
 showing off with a full brain skull 

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:07.140
 specifically with the middle cranial pit 

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:13.860
 connects this hole 

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:14.580
 what a hole for a rotonunda novel 

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:18.360
 there 

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:19.290
 but this is not a natural skull 

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:24.560
 crawls through 

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:24.560
 decree to headlights she ratundu 

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:31.940
 with oral cavity 

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:35.270
 this channel who knows the name 

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:35.270
 channel hole 

00:05:38.539 --> 00:05:50.960
 little throwing major words damn 

00:05:48.289 --> 00:05:58.979
 fissures orbital s 

00:05:50.960 --> 00:06:03.509
 inferior is three messages in the medial 

00:05:58.979 --> 00:06:05.610
 the wall has a hole which is not 

00:06:03.509 --> 00:06:13.580
 done on this skull 

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:17.190
 like this i put it perpendicular like this 

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:17.909
 hole we will be on the roadblood flax 

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:23.569
 the skull 

00:06:17.909 --> 00:06:27.360
 see the hole in the medial wall 

00:06:23.569 --> 00:06:33.389
 can from this side first look at 

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:39.509
 nasal cavity and now with this see 

00:06:33.389 --> 00:06:46.259
 as far as faramant fena ward well in 

00:06:39.509 --> 00:06:50.570
 the nasal cavity and the last one that sounds 

00:06:46.259 --> 00:06:54.740
 not badly described 

00:06:50.570 --> 00:07:03.560
 does this channel mean 

00:06:54.740 --> 00:07:11.240
 look for that channel is not present but not beeping 

00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:17.490
 he will connect the pterygoid frontal fossa 

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:21.710
 outer base of the skull in the area 

00:07:17.490 --> 00:07:25.770
 torn hole in the textbook written 

00:07:21.710 --> 00:07:29.250
 what channel usb to riga &amp; doug connects 

00:07:25.770 --> 00:07:33.509
 a hole with the outer base of the skull, this 

00:07:29.250 --> 00:07:34.430
 the phrase is not accurate because on the outside 

00:07:33.509 --> 00:07:38.450
 the grounds 

00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:41.660
 we and we have a pair of stella us 

00:07:38.450 --> 00:07:46.340
 the bridge and the house there is a spotlight us to the mouth max 

00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:47.650
 the term does not connect to them disconnects 

00:07:46.340 --> 00:07:51.410
 ripped off 

00:07:47.650 --> 00:07:54.370
 with a hole just not from this side but from 

00:07:51.410 --> 00:07:54.370
 outside 

00:07:55.030 --> 00:07:58.990
 sit down write down
