you're focusing on closing your hand and
the<00:00:46.489> muscles<00:00:46.879> that<00:00:47.059> involved<00:00:47.480> with<00:00:47.629> you<00:00:47.989> know

00:00:48.009 --> 00:00:48.019 
the muscles that involved with you know

00:00:48.019 --> 00:00:50.680 
the muscles that involved with you know
ripping<00:00:48.559> and<00:00:49.039> you<00:00:49.250> ignore<00:00:49.910> the<00:00:50.149> muscles<00:00:50.510> that

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:54.980 
muscles that run along the forearms that

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:58.419 
muscles that run along the forearms that
use<00:00:55.160> to<00:00:55.850> open<00:00:56.210> your<00:00:56.329> fingers<00:00:56.510> and<00:00:57.160> one<00:00:58.160> thing

that anytime you create an imbalance

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:02.139 
that anytime you create an imbalance
where<00:01:00.769> you're<00:01:00.890> not<00:01:01.010> really<00:01:01.070> focusing<00:01:01.789> on<00:01:01.879> both

00:01:02.139 --> 00:01:02.149 
where you're not really focusing on both

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:04.119 
where you're not really focusing on both
you<00:01:02.660> know<00:01:02.809> the<00:01:03.199> agonist<00:01:03.769> and<00:01:03.980> antagonist

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:04.129 
you know the agonist and antagonist

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:05.950 
you know the agonist and antagonist
muscle<00:01:04.910> groups<00:01:05.089> where<00:01:05.300> you're<00:01:05.449> working<00:01:05.570> both

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:05.960 
muscle groups where you're working both

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:08.980 
muscle groups where you're working both
sides<00:01:05.990> you<00:01:06.950> create<00:01:07.340> an<00:01:07.550> imbalance<00:01:07.880> and<00:01:08.360> this

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:08.990 
sides you create an imbalance and this

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:10.810 
sides you create an imbalance and this
is<00:01:09.170> just<00:01:09.409> an<00:01:09.590> invitation<00:01:09.740> for<00:01:10.280> an<00:01:10.370> injury<00:01:10.670> to

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:10.820 
is just an invitation for an injury to

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:13.120 
is just an invitation for an injury to
come<00:01:11.030> so<00:01:11.930> one<00:01:12.140> thing<00:01:12.320> that<00:01:12.350> I<00:01:12.530> like<00:01:12.680> to<00:01:12.770> do<00:01:12.920> is

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:13.130 
come so one thing that I like to do is

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:15.220 
come so one thing that I like to do is
make<00:01:13.400> sure<00:01:13.430> focus<00:01:13.940> on<00:01:14.270> working<00:01:14.750> those<00:01:14.900> smaller

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:15.230 
make sure focus on working those smaller

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:17.650 
make sure focus on working those smaller
muscles<00:01:15.680> that<00:01:15.830> open<00:01:15.890> the<00:01:16.160> fingers<00:01:16.520> and<00:01:17.000> what<00:01:17.630> I

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:17.660 
muscles that open the fingers and what I

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:20.190 
muscles that open the fingers and what I
have<00:01:17.930> here<00:01:17.960> is<00:01:18.380> just<00:01:18.410> a<00:01:18.800> small<00:01:19.100> rubber<00:01:19.430> band

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:20.200 
have here is just a small rubber band

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:22.990 
have here is just a small rubber band
it's<00:01:21.200> that's<00:01:21.620> probably<00:01:21.890> vote<00:01:22.010> a<00:01:22.220> half<00:01:22.700> inch

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:23.000 
it's that's probably vote a half inch

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.070 
it's that's probably vote a half inch
thick<00:01:23.270> you<00:01:23.420> mean<00:01:23.570> you<00:01:23.630> don't<00:01:23.720> want<00:01:23.900> to<00:01:23.960> get<00:01:24.050> a

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:24.080 
thick you mean you don't want to get a

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:26.320 
thick you mean you don't want to get a
too<00:01:24.320> too<00:01:24.530> small<00:01:24.800> of<00:01:24.830> a<00:01:25.010> rubber<00:01:25.280> band<00:01:25.430> no<00:01:25.700> make

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:26.330 
too too small of a rubber band no make

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:28.630 
too too small of a rubber band no make
it<00:01:26.450> easy<00:01:26.570> but<00:01:27.290> I<00:01:27.500> put<00:01:27.920> this<00:01:28.070> over<00:01:28.340> my

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:28.640 
it easy but I put this over my

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:31.270 
it easy but I put this over my
fingertips<00:01:29.360> and<00:01:29.600> over<00:01:30.050> my<00:01:30.170> thumb<00:01:30.410> just<00:01:30.680> like

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:31.280 
fingertips and over my thumb just like

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:33.820 
fingertips and over my thumb just like
so<00:01:31.580> and<00:01:31.790> you<00:01:32.210> can<00:01:32.330> use<00:01:32.480> this<00:01:32.660> then<00:01:32.900> to<00:01:33.230> train

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:33.830 
so and you can use this then to train

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:36.910 
so and you can use this then to train
your<00:01:34.220> finger<00:01:35.030> extensors<00:01:35.570> by<00:01:36.290> just<00:01:36.500> opening

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:36.920 
your finger extensors by just opening

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:38.710 
your finger extensors by just opening
your<00:01:36.950> fingers<00:01:37.400> against<00:01:37.880> the<00:01:37.910> resistance<00:01:38.480> of

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:38.720 
your fingers against the resistance of

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:41.830 
your fingers against the resistance of
the<00:01:39.080> rubber<00:01:39.260> band<00:01:39.530> and<00:01:40.570> you<00:01:41.570> know<00:01:41.660> there's

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:41.840 
the rubber band and you know there's

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:43.180 
the rubber band and you know there's
different<00:01:41.990> variations<00:01:42.710> that<00:01:42.800> you<00:01:42.860> can<00:01:42.950> do

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:43.190 
different variations that you can do

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:45.010 
different variations that you can do
with<00:01:43.340> this<00:01:43.520> I<00:01:43.760> mean<00:01:44.270> you<00:01:44.360> can<00:01:44.510> train<00:01:44.750> all

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:45.020 
with this I mean you can train all

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:46.870 
with this I mean you can train all
fingers<00:01:45.290> at<00:01:45.650> the<00:01:45.740> same<00:01:45.770> time<00:01:46.220> like<00:01:46.460> I'm<00:01:46.610> doing

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:46.880 
fingers at the same time like I'm doing

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:49.450 
fingers at the same time like I'm doing
here<00:01:47.120> or<00:01:47.450> you<00:01:47.750> can<00:01:47.870> just<00:01:48.110> wrap<00:01:48.350> it<00:01:48.380> around<00:01:48.560> say

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:49.460 
here or you can just wrap it around say

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:51.780 
here or you can just wrap it around say
like<00:01:49.640> your<00:01:49.790> thumb<00:01:50.060> and<00:01:50.510> your<00:01:50.840> index<00:01:50.870> finger

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:51.790 
like your thumb and your index finger

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:54.250 
like your thumb and your index finger
and<00:01:52.790> one<00:01:53.030> finger<00:01:53.240> at<00:01:53.420> a<00:01:53.450> time<00:01:53.540> and<00:01:54.020> then<00:01:54.110> do

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:54.260 
and one finger at a time and then do

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:55.870 
and one finger at a time and then do
your<00:01:54.440> middle<00:01:54.680> finger<00:01:55.070> and<00:01:55.100> just<00:01:55.340> keep<00:01:55.670> going

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:55.880 
your middle finger and just keep going

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:58.210 
your middle finger and just keep going
through<00:01:56.140> your<00:01:57.140> fingers<00:01:57.530> like<00:01:57.590> that<00:01:57.710> and<00:01:58.040> train

00:01:58.210 --> 00:01:58.220 
through your fingers like that and train

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:00.880 
through your fingers like that and train
them<00:01:58.400> individually<00:01:59.290> now<00:02:00.290> you'll<00:02:00.500> find<00:02:00.770> that

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:00.890 
them individually now you'll find that

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:02.410 
them individually now you'll find that
you<00:02:01.100> know<00:02:01.220> your<00:02:01.370> smaller<00:02:01.670> fingers<00:02:02.090> obviously

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:04.010 
your pinky and your ring finger tend to

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:06.250 
your pinky and your ring finger tend to
be<00:02:04.100> the<00:02:04.190> weakest<00:02:04.690> but<00:02:05.690> again<00:02:05.900> you<00:02:06.020> can<00:02:06.140> go

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:06.260 
be the weakest but again you can go

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.589 
be the weakest but again you can go
through<00:02:06.530> and<00:02:06.710> work<00:02:07.100> all<00:02:07.310> those<00:02:07.599> smaller

00:02:08.589 --> 00:02:08.599 
through and work all those smaller
