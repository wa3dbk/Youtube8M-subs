00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
hand goes to the handbrake pretty much

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.520 
hand goes to the handbrake pretty much
what<00:00:50.280> we've<00:00:50.399> done<00:00:50.550> is<00:00:50.850> we've<00:00:51.149> modded<00:00:51.570> the

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
what we've done is we've modded the

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.700 
what we've done is we've modded the
sequential<00:00:53.189> shifter<00:00:54.019> I've<00:00:55.019> tylenol<00:00:55.530> here

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
sequential shifter I've tylenol here

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.999 
sequential shifter I've tylenol here
this<00:00:55.979> has<00:00:56.040> been<00:00:56.100> a<00:00:56.250> headache<00:00:57.409> so<00:00:58.409> we<00:00:58.530> monta<00:00:58.890> the

00:00:58.999 --> 00:00:59.009 
this has been a headache so we monta the

00:00:59.009 --> 00:01:01.939 
this has been a headache so we monta the
sequential<00:00:59.460> shifter<00:01:00.229> that<00:01:01.229> way<00:01:01.320> this<00:01:01.530> button

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
sequential shifter that way this button

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:05.929 
sequential shifter that way this button
that's<00:01:02.339> here<00:01:02.850> is<00:01:03.059> actually<00:01:03.570> to<00:01:03.689> go<00:01:03.900> from<00:01:04.939> this

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
that's here is actually to go from this

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:07.130 
that's here is actually to go from this
button<00:01:06.270> that's<00:01:06.390> here<00:01:06.570> is<00:01:06.659> actually<00:01:06.780> to<00:01:07.020> go

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
button that's here is actually to go

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.350 
button that's here is actually to go
right<00:01:07.409> inside<00:01:07.650> of<00:01:08.220> here<00:01:08.640> something<00:01:09.060> when<00:01:09.210> this

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
right inside of here something when this

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.120 
right inside of here something when this
clicks<00:01:09.780> down<00:01:09.960> it<00:01:10.320> will<00:01:10.470> click<00:01:10.680> the<00:01:10.799> button

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
clicks down it will click the button

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.060 
clicks down it will click the button
hence<00:01:11.400> the<00:01:11.640> handbrake<00:01:12.119> goes<00:01:12.360> down<00:01:12.770> so<00:01:13.770> that's

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
hence the handbrake goes down so that's

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.760 
hence the handbrake goes down so that's
not<00:01:16.280> pretty<00:01:17.280> much<00:01:17.490> we've<00:01:17.729> wired<00:01:17.970> the<00:01:18.240> button

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:18.770 
not pretty much we've wired the button

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:22.630 
not pretty much we've wired the button
underneath<00:01:19.770> so<00:01:20.310> it<00:01:20.340> goes<00:01:20.579> through<00:01:21.170> the<00:01:22.170> actual

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:22.640 
underneath so it goes through the actual

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:26.809 
underneath so it goes through the actual
wheel<00:01:23.640> comes<00:01:24.630> or<00:01:25.380> where<00:01:25.770> is<00:01:25.890> this<00:01:26.039> eerie<00:01:26.340> it

00:01:26.809 --> 00:01:26.819 
wheel comes or where is this eerie it

00:01:26.819 --> 00:01:29.120 
wheel comes or where is this eerie it
goes<00:01:27.090> underneath<00:01:27.509> of<00:01:27.840> it<00:01:27.929> and<00:01:28.140> out<00:01:28.890> the<00:01:29.100> back

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
goes underneath of it and out the back

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.779 
goes underneath of it and out the back
so<00:01:29.670> yeah<00:01:30.390> we<00:01:30.659> got<00:01:30.810> the<00:01:30.840> button<00:01:31.109> here<00:01:31.729> going<00:01:32.729> to

00:01:32.779 --> 00:01:32.789

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
clicking and clicking and it just kept

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.360 
clicking and clicking and it just kept

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:04.040 
think the handbrake sort of helped me

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:05.410 
think the handbrake sort of helped me
out<00:04:04.069> a<00:04:04.160> lot<00:04:04.250> when<00:04:04.549> i'm<00:04:04.670> drifting<00:04:04.910> some<00:04:05.299> way<00:04:05.390> i
