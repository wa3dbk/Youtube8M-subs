forbidden Lance for all of the diverse
monsters<00:00:47.890> and<00:00:48.130> then<00:00:48.250> you<00:00:48.370> don't<00:00:48.550> have<00:00:48.700> to

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:48.790 
monsters and then you don't have to

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:50.280 
monsters and then you don't have to
worry<00:00:48.940> about<00:00:49.059> losing<00:00:49.390> any<00:00:49.719> attack<00:00:50.079> and

worry about losing any attack and

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:52.530 
worry about losing any attack and
defense<00:00:50.620> can't<00:00:51.280> use<00:00:51.730> it<00:00:51.910> during<00:00:52.059> the<00:00:52.210> damage

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:54.780 
defense can't use it during the damage
step<00:00:52.750> but<00:00:52.989> the<00:00:53.920> fact<00:00:54.100> that<00:00:54.160> it<00:00:54.309> protects<00:00:54.610> all

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:54.790 
step but the fact that it protects all
