a rifle you will see the rate of fire is

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.440 
a rifle you will see the rate of fire is
very<00:01:28.860> high<00:01:29.070> tho<00:01:29.490> you<00:01:29.549> gotta<00:01:29.880> keep<00:01:30.090> in<00:01:30.240> mind

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
very high tho you gotta keep in mind

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:31.999 
very high tho you gotta keep in mind
that<00:01:30.570> this<00:01:30.780> is<00:01:30.840> in<00:01:31.079> comparison<00:01:31.619> to<00:01:31.770> other

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
that this is in comparison to other

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.429 
that this is in comparison to other
primary<00:01:32.759> weapons<00:01:33.270> the<00:01:33.900> rate<00:01:34.110> of<00:01:34.200> fire<00:01:34.409> is

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
primary weapons the rate of fire is

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.410 
primary weapons the rate of fire is
actually<00:01:35.009> quite<00:01:35.159> low<00:01:35.460> for<00:01:35.670> auto<00:01:35.790> rifles<00:01:36.299> at

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
actually quite low for auto rifles at

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.260 
actually quite low for auto rifles at
450<00:01:37.200> rounds<00:01:37.560> per<00:01:37.860> minute<00:01:37.979> while<00:01:38.729> other<00:01:39.000> guns

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
450 rounds per minute while other guns

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.480 
450 rounds per minute while other guns
will<00:01:39.659> fire<00:01:39.869> up<00:01:40.049> to<00:01:40.200> 1000<00:01:40.920> and<00:01:41.009> maybe<00:01:41.220> even

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
will fire up to 1000 and maybe even

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.569 
will fire up to 1000 and maybe even
higher<00:01:42.090> than<00:01:42.119> that<00:01:42.479> so<00:01:42.840> the<00:01:43.590> gala<00:01:44.189> Heidi<00:01:44.369> is

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
higher than that so the gala Heidi is

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.340 
higher than that so the gala Heidi is
one<00:01:44.759> of<00:01:44.850> the<00:01:44.970> slowest<00:01:45.329> firing<00:01:45.689> auto<00:01:45.840> rifle<00:01:46.200> but

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
one of the slowest firing auto rifle but

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.830 
one of the slowest firing auto rifle but
it<00:01:46.439> makes<00:01:46.649> up<00:01:46.829> for<00:01:47.399> that<00:01:47.430> with<00:01:47.850> having<00:01:48.270> a<00:01:48.420> lot

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
it makes up for that with having a lot

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.560 
it makes up for that with having a lot
of<00:01:48.869> impact<00:01:49.350> high<00:01:49.590> damage<00:01:50.270> compared<00:01:51.270> to<00:01:51.390> the<00:01:51.540> SH

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
of impact high damage compared to the SH

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.389 
of impact high damage compared to the SH
engine<00:01:51.990> and<00:01:52.170> other<00:01:52.350> rifle<00:01:52.770> this<00:01:52.920> gun<00:01:53.130> just<00:01:53.310> a

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
engine and other rifle this gun just a

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.310 
engine and other rifle this gun just a
lot<00:01:53.579> of<00:01:53.729> damage<00:01:53.909> though<00:01:54.240> not<00:01:54.509> a<00:01:54.540> lot<00:01:54.869> compared

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
lot of damage though not a lot compared

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.350 
lot of damage though not a lot compared
to<00:01:55.500> guns<00:01:55.740> like<00:01:55.979> the<00:01:56.219> hand<00:01:56.490> Ken's<00:01:56.729> obviously

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
to guns like the hand Ken's obviously

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.600 
to guns like the hand Ken's obviously
but<00:01:57.780> it's<00:01:57.899> a<00:01:57.930> very<00:01:57.960> high<00:01:58.469> damage<00:01:58.710> auto<00:01:59.070> rifle

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
but it's a very high damage auto rifle

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.730 
but it's a very high damage auto rifle
the<00:02:00.210> range<00:02:00.420> is<00:02:00.600> also<00:02:00.930> pretty<00:02:01.140> good<00:02:01.439> on<00:02:01.590> it

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
the range is also pretty good on it

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.649 
the range is also pretty good on it
you'll<00:02:02.159> notice<00:02:02.520> it<00:02:02.640> has<00:02:02.700> a<00:02:02.820> really<00:02:03.119> good<00:02:03.390> feel

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
you'll notice it has a really good feel

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.480 
you'll notice it has a really good feel
to<00:02:03.689> with<00:02:04.140> the<00:02:04.229> recoil<00:02:04.710> and<00:02:04.890> the<00:02:05.040> reloads<00:02:05.369> are

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
to with the recoil and the reloads are

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.910 
to with the recoil and the reloads are
fairly<00:02:05.939> quick<00:02:06.420> the<00:02:07.229> attack<00:02:07.530> of<00:02:07.770> this

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
fairly quick the attack of this

just

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
just

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.570 
just
work's<00:02:14.019> overall<00:02:14.290> well<00:02:14.830> whether<00:02:15.250> you're

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:48.400 
vehicle here which I don't like too much

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:52.410 
vehicle here which I don't like too much
either<00:02:49.769> the<00:02:50.769> cascade<00:02:51.250> is<00:02:51.430> megali<00:02:52.060> kills

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:52.420 
either the cascade is megali kills

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:54.449 
either the cascade is megali kills
increased<00:02:53.230> reload<00:02:53.709> speed<00:02:53.920> which<00:02:54.130> is<00:02:54.250> very

00:02:54.449 --> 00:02:54.459 
increased reload speed which is very

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:56.069 
increased reload speed which is very
useful<00:02:54.519> so<00:02:55.030> if<00:02:55.150> you<00:02:55.239> get<00:02:55.329> a<00:02:55.390> melee<00:02:55.599> kill<00:02:55.930> you'll

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:56.079 
useful so if you get a melee kill you'll

00:02:56.079 --> 00:02:58.229 
useful so if you get a melee kill you'll
reload<00:02:56.470> faster<00:02:56.739> that's<00:02:57.190> a<00:02:57.310> great<00:02:57.549> ability<00:02:57.819> to

00:02:58.229 --> 00:02:58.239 
reload faster that's a great ability to

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:00.479 
reload faster that's a great ability to
but<00:02:59.019> keep<00:02:59.230> in<00:02:59.349> mind<00:02:59.379> this<00:02:59.709> is<00:02:59.769> not<00:02:59.890> abilities

00:03:00.479 --> 00:03:00.489 
but keep in mind this is not abilities

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:03.119 
but keep in mind this is not abilities
that<00:03:00.700> everyone<00:03:01.209> will<00:03:01.390> get<00:03:01.569> so<00:03:01.930> you<00:03:02.709> may<00:03:02.890> get
