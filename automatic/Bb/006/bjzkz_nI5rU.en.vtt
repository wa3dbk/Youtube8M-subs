00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
weapon in real life is quite a quite a

weapon in real life is quite a quite a
visceral<00:00:55.409> dynamic<00:00:55.979> experience<00:00:56.309> and<00:00:56.760> we<00:00:57.269> tried

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
visceral dynamic experience and we tried

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.090 
visceral dynamic experience and we tried
to<00:00:57.629> emulate<00:00:57.870> that<00:00:58.140> as<00:00:58.290> best<00:00:58.440> we<00:00:58.589> can<00:00:58.860> I<00:00:58.920> mean

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
to emulate that as best we can I mean

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.680 
to emulate that as best we can I mean
through<00:00:59.309> synchronization<00:01:00.120> of<00:01:00.239> things<00:01:00.510> like

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
through synchronization of things like

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.780 
through synchronization of things like
Rumble<00:01:01.079> pump<00:01:01.350> in<00:01:01.469> the<00:01:01.530> field<00:01:01.769> of<00:01:01.890> view<00:01:02.070> rising

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
the camera during the recoil really

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.380 
the camera during the recoil really
trying<00:01:05.159> to<00:01:05.190> get<00:01:05.339> that<00:01:05.489> sense<00:01:05.759> of<00:01:05.970> that<00:01:06.060> punch

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
trying to get that sense of that punch

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.480 
trying to get that sense of that punch

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
important thing for the player to feel

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.560 
important thing for the player to feel
like<00:01:25.649> they<00:01:25.770> have<00:01:25.799> a<00:01:25.920> choice<00:01:26.100> and<00:01:26.399> so<00:01:27.030> yeah<00:01:27.450> the

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
like they have a choice and so yeah the

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.630 
like they have a choice and so yeah the
weapons<00:01:27.899> are<00:01:27.990> big<00:01:28.200> are<00:01:28.500> very<00:01:28.680> strong<00:01:29.009> pretty

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
weapons are big are very strong pretty

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.880 
weapons are big are very strong pretty
angry<00:01:30.090> and<00:01:30.299> there's<00:01:31.170> quite<00:01:31.320> a<00:01:31.350> lot<00:01:31.439> of<00:01:31.560> nuance

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
angry and there's quite a lot of nuance

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.410 
angry and there's quite a lot of nuance
in<00:01:32.070> them<00:01:32.220> so<00:01:32.399> we're<00:01:32.520> really<00:01:32.700> trying<00:01:32.909> to<00:01:33.000> get

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
in them so we're really trying to get

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:34.789 
in them so we're really trying to get
the<00:01:33.540> player<00:01:33.720> to<00:01:33.899> understand<00:01:34.380> them<00:01:34.530> and<00:01:34.680> you

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
the player to understand them and you

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:36.590 
the player to understand them and you
know<00:01:34.890> can't<00:01:35.220> find<00:01:35.460> their<00:01:35.610> favorite<00:01:35.789> my

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600

favorite<00:01:36.630> weapon<00:01:37.289> in<00:01:37.409> there<00:01:37.590> would<00:01:37.770> probably

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
favorite weapon in there would probably

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:44.120 
favorite weapon in there would probably
be<00:01:38.490> the<00:01:38.880> shotgun<00:01:42.380> really<00:01:43.380> good<00:01:43.500> fun<00:01:43.679> to<00:01:43.830> use<00:01:43.950> of

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
be the shotgun really good fun to use of

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:45.380 
be the shotgun really good fun to use of
clothes<00:01:44.340> you<00:01:44.549> can<00:01:44.670> blow<00:01:44.880> people<00:01:45.179> off<00:01:45.210> their

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
clothes you can blow people off their

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.660 
clothes you can blow people off their
feet<00:01:45.630> through<00:01:45.929> windows<00:01:46.320> through<00:01:47.070> all<00:01:47.280> all

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
feet through windows through all all

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.160 
feet through windows through all all
kinds<00:01:48.330> of<00:01:48.420> things<00:01:48.600> I<00:01:48.720> mean<00:01:48.840> it's<00:01:48.960> a<00:01:49.020> real

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
kinds of things I mean it's a real

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.200 
kinds of things I mean it's a real
satisfying<00:01:49.710> gun<00:01:49.979> to<00:01:50.100> use<00:01:50.280> the<00:01:50.670> intensity<00:01:51.149> of

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
satisfying gun to use the intensity of

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:52.370 
satisfying gun to use the intensity of
body<00:01:51.360> count<00:01:51.600> mostly<00:01:51.929> comes<00:01:52.110> from<00:01:52.289> the

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
body count mostly comes from the

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.289 
body count mostly comes from the
shredding<00:01:52.740> so<00:01:53.039> you're<00:01:53.310> not<00:01:53.399> able<00:01:53.729> to<00:01:54.060> hide

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
shredding so you're not able to hide

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:55.850 
shredding so you're not able to hide
anywhere<00:01:54.750> very<00:01:54.990> long<00:01:55.229> particularly<00:01:55.679> if

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
anywhere very long particularly if

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.169 
anywhere very long particularly if
you're<00:01:55.950> outdoors<00:01:56.130> behind<00:01:56.819> a<00:01:56.880> pile<00:01:57.149> of

00:01:57.169 --> 00:01:57.179 
you're outdoors behind a pile of

00:01:57.179 --> 00:01:59.059 
you're outdoors behind a pile of
something<00:01:57.840> what<00:01:58.289> you'll<00:01:58.409> find<00:01:58.590> is<00:01:58.830> that<00:01:58.860> as

00:01:59.059 --> 00:01:59.069 
something what you'll find is that as

00:01:59.069 --> 00:02:00.770 
something what you'll find is that as
the<00:01:59.159> bullets<00:01:59.459> start<00:01:59.700> flying<00:01:59.789> you<00:02:00.600> actually

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
the bullets start flying you actually

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.230 
the bullets start flying you actually
take<00:02:01.170> a<00:02:01.319> lot<00:02:01.709> of<00:02:01.740> fire<00:02:02.100> through<00:02:02.549> cutter<00:02:02.909> that

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
take a lot of fire through cutter that

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.590 
take a lot of fire through cutter that
keeps<00:02:03.479> you<00:02:03.659> moving<00:02:03.810> so<00:02:05.209> the<00:02:06.209> cover<00:02:06.420> lean

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:08.549 
mechanic and body count is our attempt

00:02:08.549 --> 00:02:10.520 
mechanic and body count is our attempt
to<00:02:08.670> introduce<00:02:08.819> a<00:02:09.119> non-sticky<00:02:09.720> cover<00:02:10.289> system

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
to introduce a non-sticky cover system

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.340 
to introduce a non-sticky cover system
for<00:02:10.830> an<00:02:10.890> F<00:02:10.979> yeah<00:02:11.299> grab<00:02:12.299> the<00:02:12.420> left<00:02:12.540> trigger<00:02:12.810> it

routes you to the spot in a semi iron
sight<00:02:15.120> mode<00:02:15.360> but<00:02:15.900> then<00:02:16.019> you've<00:02:16.140> got<00:02:16.260> full

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
sight mode but then you've got full

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:17.690 
sight mode but then you've got full
range<00:02:16.709> of<00:02:16.830> movement<00:02:17.250> on<00:02:17.310> both<00:02:17.459> the<00:02:17.580> analogs

tips<00:02:18.239> that<00:02:18.480> allows<00:02:18.690> all<00:02:18.870> that<00:02:19.049> pivoting<00:02:19.620> and

00:02:19.759 --> 00:02:19.769 
tips that allows all that pivoting and

tips that allows all that pivoting and
weaving<00:02:20.130> about<00:02:20.400> so<00:02:21.150> what<00:02:21.360> we're<00:02:21.510> trying<00:02:21.540> to<00:02:21.720> do

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
weaving about so what we're trying to do

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:23.330 
weaving about so what we're trying to do
with<00:02:21.840> the<00:02:22.019> focus<00:02:22.349> mode<00:02:22.530> did<00:02:22.680> bring<00:02:23.040> the<00:02:23.160> gun

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
with the focus mode did bring the gun

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.819 
with the focus mode did bring the gun
back<00:02:23.610> so<00:02:23.849> it's<00:02:24.000> not<00:02:24.299> covering<00:02:24.810> the<00:02:25.410> thing<00:02:25.620> but

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:25.829 
back so it's not covering the thing but

00:02:25.829 --> 00:02:27.259 
back so it's not covering the thing but
look<00:02:26.190> you<00:02:26.340> know<00:02:26.400> obviously<00:02:26.549> the<00:02:26.850> field<00:02:27.120> of

00:02:27.259 --> 00:02:27.269 
look you know obviously the field of

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:30.069 
look you know obviously the field of
view<00:02:27.390> items<00:02:27.870> you<00:02:28.380> go<00:02:28.530> closer<00:02:28.829> into<00:02:29.280> the<00:02:29.310> gun

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:30.079 
view items you go closer into the gun

00:02:30.079 --> 00:02:34.660 
view items you go closer into the gun
the<00:02:31.079> audio<00:02:31.530> for<00:02:31.859> the<00:02:31.920> gun<00:02:32.130> changes<00:02:32.609> any

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:34.670 
the audio for the gun changes any

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:37.100 
the audio for the gun changes any
you<00:02:35.670> know<00:02:35.790> the<00:02:35.940> impression<00:02:36.630> we<00:02:36.690> wanted<00:02:36.930> to<00:02:36.960> get

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
you know the impression we wanted to get

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:38.870 
you know the impression we wanted to get
was<00:02:37.320> you<00:02:37.470> getting<00:02:37.830> on<00:02:37.920> top<00:02:38.190> of<00:02:38.400> the<00:02:38.490> gun<00:02:38.700> and

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
was you getting on top of the gun and

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:40.670 
was you getting on top of the gun and
then<00:02:39.540> when<00:02:39.630> you<00:02:39.720> fire<00:02:40.020> the<00:02:40.230> gun<00:02:40.410> it's

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
then when you fire the gun it's

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:43.220 
then when you fire the gun it's
obviously<00:02:41.070> very<00:02:41.160> wild<00:02:41.850> but<00:02:42.330> in<00:02:42.510> the<00:02:42.780> way<00:02:43.050> we

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
obviously very wild but in the way we

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:44.900 
obviously very wild but in the way we
handle<00:02:43.560> the<00:02:43.650> recoil<00:02:43.800> and<00:02:44.160> everything<00:02:44.490> we<00:02:44.670> get

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910 
handle the recoil and everything we get

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:46.790 
handle the recoil and everything we get
holder<00:02:45.270> again<00:02:45.480> we<00:02:45.660> tame<00:02:45.960> the<00:02:46.170> beast<00:02:46.380> it's<00:02:46.620> not

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:46.800 
holder again we tame the beast it's not

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.220 
holder again we tame the beast it's not
bring<00:02:47.070> it<00:02:47.160> back<00:02:47.310> there<00:02:47.520> explosions<00:02:48.420> VFX<00:02:48.930> all

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
bring it back there explosions VFX all

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:51.110 
bring it back there explosions VFX all
of<00:02:49.350> that<00:02:49.470> stuff<00:02:49.740> very<00:02:50.160> very<00:02:50.310> important<00:02:50.910> to<00:02:51.030> the

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
of that stuff very very important to the

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.240 
of that stuff very very important to the
game<00:02:51.330> so<00:02:51.870> if<00:02:52.050> a<00:02:52.110> bullet<00:02:52.290> hits<00:02:52.590> something<00:02:52.830> if<00:02:53.160> a

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
game so if a bullet hits something if a

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:54.740 
game so if a bullet hits something if a
grenade<00:02:53.550> goes<00:02:53.760> off<00:02:53.940> we<00:02:54.150> want<00:02:54.300> you<00:02:54.420> to<00:02:54.480> feel

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
grenade goes off we want you to feel

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:56.780 
grenade goes off we want you to feel
that<00:02:54.780> the<00:02:54.990> world<00:02:55.260> has<00:02:55.500> been<00:02:55.650> impacted<00:02:56.370> and

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
that the world has been impacted and

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:58.520 
that the world has been impacted and
part<00:02:57.090> of<00:02:57.150> that<00:02:57.330> is<00:02:57.390> having<00:02:57.570> big<00:02:58.170> meaty

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
part of that is having big meaty

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:02.390 
part of that is having big meaty
explosions<00:02:59.250> and<00:02:59.430> tons<00:02:59.670> of<00:02:59.850> stuff<00:03:00.120> like<00:03:01.280> if<00:03:02.280> an

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
explosions and tons of stuff like if an

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.160 
explosions and tons of stuff like if an
explosion<00:03:02.640> goes<00:03:03.030> off<00:03:03.180> in<00:03:03.330> a<00:03:03.390> dark<00:03:03.630> place<00:03:03.840> it's

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170 
explosion goes off in a dark place it's

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:06.680 
explosion goes off in a dark place it's
obviously<00:03:04.620> a<00:03:04.740> brand<00:03:05.040> new<00:03:05.130> light<00:03:05.370> source<00:03:05.700> so<00:03:06.390> in

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:06.690 
obviously a brand new light source so in

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:08.750 
obviously a brand new light source so in
reality<00:03:06.870> your<00:03:07.290> eyes<00:03:07.410> would<00:03:07.650> struggle<00:03:07.980> to<00:03:08.130> you

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
reality your eyes would struggle to you

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:10.250 
reality your eyes would struggle to you
know<00:03:08.850> except<00:03:09.240> that<00:03:09.390> lighting<00:03:09.780> so<00:03:09.930> everything

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260 
know except that lighting so everything

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.560 
know except that lighting so everything
blooms<00:03:10.710> out<00:03:10.980> essentially<00:03:11.520> and<00:03:12.030> we've<00:03:12.150> kind<00:03:12.540> of

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:12.570 
blooms out essentially and we've kind of

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:14.210 
blooms out essentially and we've kind of
simulated<00:03:13.230> things<00:03:13.470> like<00:03:13.650> that<00:03:13.770> in<00:03:13.950> the<00:03:14.070> game

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.220 
simulated things like that in the game

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:16.340 
simulated things like that in the game
as<00:03:14.370> well<00:03:14.520> we're<00:03:14.760> even<00:03:15.090> down<00:03:15.240> to<00:03:15.270> the<00:03:15.510> muzzle

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:16.350 
as well we're even down to the muzzle

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:20.390 
as well we're even down to the muzzle

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
flashes my favorite weapon is actually

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.250 
flashes my favorite weapon is actually
one<00:03:20.520> of<00:03:20.550> the<00:03:20.700> ones<00:03:20.850> we've<00:03:21.030> invented<00:03:21.360> for<00:03:22.200> the

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.260 
one of the ones we've invented for the

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.080 
one of the ones we've invented for the
target<00:03:22.620> who<00:03:22.920> are<00:03:23.070> the<00:03:23.160> bad<00:03:23.340> guys<00:03:23.400> in<00:03:23.790> the<00:03:23.910> game

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.090 
target who are the bad guys in the game

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:26.120 
target who are the bad guys in the game
we've<00:03:24.660> taken<00:03:24.900> some<00:03:25.110> real-world<00:03:25.380> style

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:26.130 
we've taken some real-world style

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:28.100 
we've taken some real-world style
technology<00:03:26.820> is<00:03:26.880> basically<00:03:27.360> a<00:03:27.390> portable<00:03:27.870> rail

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:28.110 
technology is basically a portable rail

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:30.500 
technology is basically a portable rail
gun<00:03:28.410> called<00:03:28.770> the<00:03:28.860> Kaluka<00:03:29.340> and<00:03:29.580> we<00:03:29.970> completely

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510 
gun called the Kaluka and we completely

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:32.270 
gun called the Kaluka and we completely
fantasize<00:03:31.050> it<00:03:31.260> so<00:03:31.380> we've<00:03:31.530> created<00:03:31.800> a<00:03:32.010> really

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280 
fantasize it so we've created a really

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:34.190 
fantasize it so we've created a really
powerful<00:03:32.550> brutal<00:03:33.450> weapon<00:03:33.600> that's<00:03:33.900> very<00:03:34.080> very

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.200 
powerful brutal weapon that's very very

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:38.479 
powerful brutal weapon that's very very
effective<00:03:34.800> for<00:03:36.380> me<00:03:37.380> personally<00:03:37.650> it's<00:03:38.160> got<00:03:38.370> to

00:03:38.479 --> 00:03:38.489 
effective for me personally it's got to

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:41.059 
effective for me personally it's got to
be<00:03:38.550> the<00:03:38.640> shotgun<00:03:39.000> every<00:03:39.330> time

00:03:41.059 --> 00:03:41.069 
be the shotgun every time

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:43.550 
be the shotgun every time
it<00:03:41.909> forms<00:03:42.299> two<00:03:42.569> roles<00:03:42.870> firstly<00:03:43.469> it's

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560 
it forms two roles firstly it's

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:45.140 
it forms two roles firstly it's
brilliant<00:03:44.010> for<00:03:44.129> shredding<00:03:44.340> especially<00:03:45.090> in

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:45.150 
brilliant for shredding especially in

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:46.789
