00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:15.617
The Boo in the Shoe

00:00:15.617 --> 00:00:21.867
By Kuzhali Manickavel

00:00:21.867 --> 00:00:26.700
Have you ever seen Boos?

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:29.867
They are playful creatures

00:00:29.867 --> 00:00:31.783
you think you see

00:00:31.783 --> 00:00:40.450
under your bed at night.

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:45.033
Some look like orange zebras,

00:00:45.033 --> 00:00:47.950
others like flying snails.

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:50.200
They can tease

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:53.283
or make you sneeze -

00:00:53.283 --> 00:00:54.783
they can even

00:00:54.783 --> 00:00:56.950
make chocolates appear

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:01.033
in empty pockets!

00:01:01.033 --> 00:01:03.533
Puzzle, the Boo

00:01:03.533 --> 00:01:05.283
looked a bit

00:01:05.283 --> 00:01:07.033
like an elephant,

00:01:07.033 --> 00:01:09.617
only he was purple

00:01:09.617 --> 00:01:10.950
most of the time

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.200
and the size of a mouse.

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.200
Meera stumbled upon him

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.867
one morning by accident.

00:01:19.867 --> 00:01:21.617
There he was,

00:01:21.617 --> 00:01:25.200
sniffing and moaning,

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.450
his backside firmly wedged

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:32.950
inside her shoe.

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:36.533
“I must be dreaming,” she thought.

00:01:36.533 --> 00:01:38.200
She poked him

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:41.283
to see what would happen.

00:01:41.283 --> 00:01:44.533
“Ouch!” howled Puzzle.

00:01:44.533 --> 00:01:49.533
“Oh! I’m very sorry,” she apologized.

00:01:49.533 --> 00:01:56.867
“I’m stuck!” he bawled.

00:01:56.867 --> 00:02:02.700
In fact, he had been stuck there all night

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.950
and had given up hope

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:10.117
of ever getting free.

00:02:10.117 --> 00:02:13.700
Meera examined him closely.

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:16.450
“Let me see if I can help,”

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:27.117
she said, pulling him by the legs.

00:02:27.117 --> 00:02:29.450
She pushed him from behind.

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:34.283
She even banged the shoe against the floor.

00:02:34.283 --> 00:02:36.700
“I could put you in soapy water,”

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:42.117
she suggested.

00:02:42.117 --> 00:02:54.283
No, Puzzle was scared of bubbles.

00:02:54.283 --> 00:02:56.867
“What if I poured oil on you?”

00:02:56.867 --> 00:02:59.117
she asked.

00:02:59.117 --> 00:02:59.533
Puzzle

00:02:59.533 --> 00:03:02.617
began to squeak and sob.

00:03:02.617 --> 00:03:04.867
He certainly didn’t want

00:03:04.867 --> 00:03:08.283
oil poured on him!

00:03:08.283 --> 00:03:09.200
“I know

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:11.867
how to stop you from crying!”

00:03:11.867 --> 00:03:14.283
Meera shouted merrily.

00:03:14.283 --> 00:03:18.617
She started to tickle Puzzle.

00:03:18.617 --> 00:03:19.283
Boos

00:03:19.283 --> 00:03:23.450
are very ticklish,

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:25.950
and soon he

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:29.867
was squirming and giggling.

00:03:29.867 --> 00:03:32.867
The more Meera tickled him,

00:03:32.867 --> 00:03:34.867
the more he squirmed

00:03:34.867 --> 00:03:37.283
until suddenly...

00:03:37.283 --> 00:03:40.450
“Look! You’re unstuck!”

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:41.783
cried Meera

00:03:41.783 --> 00:03:44.950
excitedly, clapping her hands.

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:49.950
Puzzle blinked. He wiggled his legs.

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:51.450
He wiggled his tail.

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:54.033
Then he wiggled his whole body,

00:03:54.033 --> 00:04:02.367
just to make sure.

00:04:02.367 --> 00:04:06.450
“Yay! I’m free!” he trumpeted

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:10.367
as he bounced around the room.

00:04:10.367 --> 00:04:12.867
He bounced onto her hand

00:04:12.867 --> 00:04:14.200
and smiled.

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:16.200
“What would you like before

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:19.200
I go?

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:23.533
Chocolates?

00:04:23.533 --> 00:04:28.783
Shall I make your school disappear?”

00:04:28.783 --> 00:04:30.950
“Do you have to go?”

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:33.450
asked Meera sadly.

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:34.533
“I wish

00:04:34.533 --> 00:04:36.533
you could stay.

00:04:36.533 --> 00:04:43.950
We could be friends!”

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:48.200
Boos didn’t have human friends.

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:52.783
“That’s a great idea!” he squeaked.

00:04:52.783 --> 00:04:56.033
“Just say

00:04:56.033 --> 00:04:58.117
‘Puzzle the Boo,

00:04:58.117 --> 00:05:01.033
I want to see you’

00:05:01.033 --> 00:05:02.283
and I’ll come!”

00:05:02.283 --> 00:05:04.700
“Promise?” she asked.

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:07.283
“I promise!” winked Puzzle.

00:05:07.283 --> 00:05:11.700
The school bus honked loudly.

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:14.783
“Okay, we’ll play after school.

00:05:14.783 --> 00:05:15.950
See you later!”

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:20.033
she said as she rushed outside.

00:05:20.033 --> 00:05:24.200
After school, Meera went to the garden.

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:26.867
She shut her eyes and murmured

00:05:26.867 --> 00:05:29.783
the magic words.

00:05:29.783 --> 00:05:39.867
There was a humming sound,

00:05:39.867 --> 00:05:43.867
and Puzzle appeared in a flash!

00:05:43.867 --> 00:05:47.950
They laughed and played until sunset.

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:50.700
And from that day on, Meera and

00:05:50.700 --> 00:06:00.867
Puzzle became best friends.
