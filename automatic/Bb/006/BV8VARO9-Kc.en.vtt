00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:07.760
 Hello everyone, everyone. 

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:10.120
 Welcome to this episode "Weather Cold Knowledge" 

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:14.320
 Every year from May to November is the season of Hong Kong. 

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:15.960
 In this period of time 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.680
 Hong Kong may be affected by tropical cyclones of different strengths 

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:23.080
 Among them July and September 

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:26.480
 Is the month most likely to be affected by the typhoon 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.480
 When tropical cyclones approach Hong Kong 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:31.760
 How big is Hong Kongâ€™s impact? 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.400
 In addition to seeing what strength tropical cyclones are 

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:38.160
 We must also consider how big its circulation is. 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:41.480
 Distance and movement path with Hong Kong 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:45.280
 In the past many years, Hong Kong has been hit by storms many times. 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:48.080
 The Observatory has also collected a lot of data. 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:51.320
 We have also developed tools for forecasting 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:55.000
 Let forecasters when tropical cyclones approach Hong Kong 

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:58.040
 Predicting when Hong Kong will be the wind 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:00.440
 "Weather Cold Knowledge" in this episode 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:03.640
 I will tell you when I am in the wind. 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:06.280
 The "pig waist" that forecasters will use 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:10.320
 This pork loin is not used to cook the pork loin. 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.680
 But a specific area near Hong Kong 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.720
 When a tropical cyclone enters this area 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:20.160
 Some places in Hong Kong are convenient to blow up strong winds 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:22.720
 Because its shape looks 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:25.040
 There are a few points like the pork loin in the market. 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:27.120
 So when you are fighting 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.480
 Observers at the Observatory to ease the tension 

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:32.680
 Will give it an interesting name 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:36.800
 The picture that everyone is seeing now shows 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:40.320
 When there is a typhoon or a tropical cyclone above 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.160
 When entering this area 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:46.200
 Yokohama Island will have a 50% chance to blow strong winds 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.120
 How do our forecasters use this tool? 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.280
 The forecaster will take this picture 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.480
 Superimposed on the predicted path of tropical cyclones 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:58.640
 This will predict the Yokohama Island 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:02.480
 When will there be a chance to start blowing strong winds? 

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:05.600
 And when the storm leaves 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.280
 When will the winds of Waglan Island weaken? 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.520
 Due to the circulation and size of each tropical cyclone 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:16.480
 So when encountering a tropical cyclone with a large circulation 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.600
 The forecaster will adopt a "pig waist" with a lower chance of chance. 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:21.880
 In other words 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:23.400
 The storm is far from Hong Kong 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.040
 It may also make us windy 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:30.080
 On the contrary, if the impact of the storm is relatively small 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:33.400
 I will refer to the "pig waist" with a relatively high chance of chance. 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:36.360
 For different levels of tropical cyclones 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:38.080
 Such as tropical depression 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:39.200
 Tropical storm 

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:41.200
 Or a strong tropical storm 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:44.000
 They also have a set of "pig waist" 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:48.080
 And when the storm has signs of augmenting or weakening 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:49.880
 Forecasters need 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:53.400
 Use more than one set of pork loin as a reference 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.480
 The pork loin just introduced 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:59.400
 Is used to predict the wind change in Waglan Island 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:02.080
 In fact, we still have several sets of pork loin. 

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:07.080
 It is used to predict changes in wind power in Victoria Harbour, airports and different places. 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:09.280
 Pig waist shape 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:13.240
 Will be updated as the data collected by the Observatory increases 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:17.440
 In addition to saying when to wind, when to predict when to wind 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:21.400
 The forecaster also wants to predict which direction the wind is blowing. 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:25.320
 The next gathering will introduce you to another set of tools. 

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:28.440
 Is used to help forecasters predict wind direction 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:32.000
 And this tool also has an interesting name. 

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:35.280
 The "Weather Cold Knowledge" in this episode ends here. 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:36.480
 Thank you for watching.
