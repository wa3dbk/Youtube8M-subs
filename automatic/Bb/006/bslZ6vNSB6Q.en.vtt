00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:17.650 
actually talk a little bit about the

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:19.769 
actually talk a little bit about the
actual<00:00:18.099> period<00:00:18.369> instruments<00:00:18.820> what<00:00:19.420> I<00:00:19.449> have

00:00:19.769 --> 00:00:19.779 
actual period instruments what I have

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:23.490 
actual period instruments what I have
here<00:00:20.140> is<00:00:20.590> a<00:00:20.800> reproduction<00:00:21.579> of<00:00:22.029> an<00:00:22.810> ahmadi<00:00:23.079> so

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:23.500 
here is a reproduction of an ahmadi so

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:25.140 
here is a reproduction of an ahmadi so
this<00:00:23.619> is<00:00:23.740> my<00:00:23.860> baroque<00:00:24.160> violin<00:00:24.579> which<00:00:24.789> was<00:00:24.970> made

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:25.150 
this is my baroque violin which was made

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:27.870 
this is my baroque violin which was made
in<00:00:25.320> 2007<00:00:26.320> and<00:00:26.800> of<00:00:26.919> course<00:00:27.099> my<00:00:27.250> modern<00:00:27.489> violin

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:27.880 
in 2007 and of course my modern violin

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:32.009 
in 2007 and of course my modern violin
was<00:00:28.029> made<00:00:28.090> in<00:00:28.330> 1703<00:00:30.060> so<00:00:31.060> we'll<00:00:31.210> explain<00:00:31.960> how

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:32.019 
was made in 1703 so we'll explain how

00:00:32.019 --> 00:00:33.720 
was made in 1703 so we'll explain how
that<00:00:32.320> works<00:00:32.529> later<00:00:32.680> but<00:00:33.220> these<00:00:33.370> instruments

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:33.730 
that works later but these instruments

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:35.610 
that works later but these instruments
um<00:00:34.269> you<00:00:34.839> know<00:00:34.930> I<00:00:34.989> don't<00:00:35.140> want<00:00:35.290> to<00:00:35.350> go<00:00:35.410> into<00:00:35.589> a

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:35.620 
um you know I don't want to go into a

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:38.579 
um you know I don't want to go into a
lot<00:00:35.860> of<00:00:35.980> technique<00:00:37.019> technical<00:00:38.019> discussion<00:00:38.440> of

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:38.589 
lot of technique technical discussion of

00:00:38.589 --> 00:00:40.590 
lot of technique technical discussion of
how<00:00:38.769> they're<00:00:38.949> constructed<00:00:39.100> but<00:00:39.879> they're<00:00:40.120> to

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:40.600 
how they're constructed but they're to

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:42.569 
how they're constructed but they're to
be<00:00:40.720> played<00:00:40.960> with<00:00:41.199> this<00:00:41.410> bow<00:00:41.680> which<00:00:42.339> you<00:00:42.460> can

00:00:42.569 --> 00:00:42.579 
be played with this bow which you can

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:44.490 
be played with this bow which you can
see<00:00:42.730> does<00:00:42.879> not<00:00:42.910> have<00:00:43.210> any<00:00:43.360> camber<00:00:43.809> it<00:00:44.320> has<00:00:44.470> a

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:44.500 
see does not have any camber it has a

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:46.770 
see does not have any camber it has a
pretty<00:00:44.920> thin<00:00:45.339> playing<00:00:45.760> strip<00:00:46.089> of<00:00:46.239> hair<00:00:46.449> and

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:46.780 
pretty thin playing strip of hair and

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:50.130 
pretty thin playing strip of hair and
it's<00:00:47.650> designed<00:00:48.129> to<00:00:48.280> be<00:00:48.519> an<00:00:49.269> instrument<00:00:49.780> that

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:50.140 
it's designed to be an instrument that

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:51.590 
it's designed to be an instrument that
you<00:00:50.260> don't<00:00:50.500> hold

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
you don't hold

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.780 
you don't hold
there's<00:00:52.600> no<00:00:52.780> chin<00:00:53.080> rest<00:00:53.320> so<00:00:54.040> it's<00:00:54.220> balanced

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:54.790 
there's no chin rest so it's balanced

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:56.789 
there's no chin rest so it's balanced
here<00:00:55.150> as<00:00:55.299> the<00:00:55.900> instrument<00:00:56.350> that's<00:00:56.439> designed

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:56.799 
here as the instrument that's designed

00:00:56.799 --> 00:00:58.700 
here as the instrument that's designed
to<00:00:56.920> be<00:00:56.979> very<00:00:57.280> resonant<00:00:57.850> in<00:00:58.059> this<00:00:58.210> beautiful

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
to be very resonant in this beautiful

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:08.820 
to be very resonant in this beautiful
18th<00:00:59.710> century<00:01:00.040> Ballroom<00:01:05.790> so<00:01:06.790> that<00:01:07.180> note<00:01:07.450> in<00:01:07.990> an

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:08.830 
18th century Ballroom so that note in an

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:13.580 
18th century Ballroom so that note in an
18th<00:01:09.130> century<00:01:09.159> courtroom<00:01:10.060> would<00:01:10.479> resound<00:01:11.259> ok

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
18th century courtroom would resound ok

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.520 
18th century courtroom would resound ok
yeah<00:01:14.590> so<00:01:14.770> my<00:01:14.950> my<00:01:15.280> cello<00:01:15.580> is<00:01:15.820> actually<00:01:16.180> from

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
yeah so my my cello is actually from

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.880 
yeah so my my cello is actually from
1770<00:01:18.270> went<00:01:19.270> through<00:01:19.600> a<00:01:19.630> process<00:01:20.380> of<00:01:20.530> being

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:20.890 
1770 went through a process of being

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:24.150 
1770 went through a process of being
modernized<00:01:21.700> for<00:01:22.150> today<00:01:22.660> and<00:01:23.020> then<00:01:23.530> when<00:01:23.890> I<00:01:23.920> got

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:24.160 
modernized for today and then when I got

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:26.130 
modernized for today and then when I got
my<00:01:24.340> well<00:01:24.700> after<00:01:25.090> I<00:01:25.120> had<00:01:25.330> had<00:01:25.480> my<00:01:25.600> hands<00:01:25.840> on<00:01:25.930> for

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:26.140 
my well after I had had my hands on for

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:27.750 
my well after I had had my hands on for
a<00:01:26.170> number<00:01:26.260> of<00:01:26.410> years<00:01:26.620> I<00:01:26.860> restored<00:01:27.370> it<00:01:27.460> to<00:01:27.520> its

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:27.760 
a number of years I restored it to its

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:30.360 
a number of years I restored it to its
original<00:01:28.020> setup<00:01:29.020> so<00:01:29.680> it's<00:01:29.860> been<00:01:30.070> through

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:30.370 
original setup so it's been through

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:32.580 
original setup so it's been through
quite<00:01:30.640> a<00:01:30.760> lot<00:01:30.900> you'll<00:01:31.900> notice<00:01:32.230> the<00:01:32.380> main

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:32.590 
quite a lot you'll notice the main

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:36.530 
quite a lot you'll notice the main
probably<00:01:33.220> the<00:01:33.310> main<00:01:33.460> feature<00:01:33.820> is<00:01:34.320> there's<00:01:35.320> no

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
probably the main feature is there's no

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:41.370 
probably the main feature is there's no
intent<00:01:37.540> right<00:01:37.810> so<00:01:38.110> when<00:01:38.320> I<00:01:38.350> play<00:01:38.740> it<00:01:38.980> I<00:01:40.350> make<00:01:41.350> a

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:41.380 
intent right so when I play it I make a

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:42.460 
intent right so when I play it I make a
basket

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:42.470 
basket

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:48.580 
basket
with<00:01:42.680> my<00:01:42.830> legs<00:01:43.070> and<00:01:43.870> sit<00:01:46.840> and<00:01:47.840> just<00:01:48.050> rest<00:01:48.350> it

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:48.590 
with my legs and sit and just rest it

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:54.490 
with my legs and sit and just rest it
and<00:01:48.830> what<00:01:49.490> happens<00:01:49.940> is<00:01:50.330> that<00:01:52.090> that<00:01:53.290> if<00:01:54.290> it's

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:54.500 
and what happens is that that if it's

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:58.120 
and what happens is that that if it's
anchored<00:01:55.220> into<00:01:55.460> the<00:01:55.580> floor<00:01:56.500> you<00:01:57.500> have<00:01:57.830> it's

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:58.130 
anchored into the floor you have it's

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:02.050 
anchored into the floor you have it's
much<00:01:58.340> more<00:01:58.550> solid<00:01:59.950> approach<00:02:00.950> and<00:02:01.400> and<00:02:01.760> when

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:02.060 
much more solid approach and and when

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:03.700 
much more solid approach and and when
it's<00:02:02.240> anchored<00:02:02.600> into<00:02:02.810> the<00:02:03.020> body<00:02:03.320> there's<00:02:03.650> a

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:03.710 
it's anchored into the body there's a

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:06.100 
it's anchored into the body there's a
lot<00:02:03.950> of<00:02:04.100> gifts<00:02:04.520> and<00:02:05.060> so<00:02:05.210> what<00:02:05.330> happens<00:02:05.690> is<00:02:05.780> when

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:06.110 
lot of gifts and so what happens is when

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:09.010 
lot of gifts and so what happens is when
I<00:02:06.140> go<00:02:06.500> and<00:02:07.160> I<00:02:07.280> play<00:02:07.580> there's<00:02:08.479> a<00:02:08.540> lot<00:02:08.840> of

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:09.020 
I go and I play there's a lot of

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:11.950 
I go and I play there's a lot of
information<00:02:09.770> that<00:02:10.220> I'm<00:02:10.430> getting<00:02:10.960> here

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:11.960 
information that I'm getting here

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:14.890 
information that I'm getting here
calculate<00:02:12.830> with<00:02:13.100> my<00:02:13.250> hand<00:02:13.580> and<00:02:13.850> the<00:02:14.450> reaction

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:14.900 
calculate with my hand and the reaction

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:16.900 
calculate with my hand and the reaction
of<00:02:14.990> the<00:02:15.140> string<00:02:15.560> because<00:02:16.340> there's<00:02:16.550> the<00:02:16.670> skin

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:16.910 
of the string because there's the skin

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:18.220 
of the string because there's the skin
of<00:02:17.060> my<00:02:17.180> body<00:02:17.390> so<00:02:17.570> there's<00:02:17.720> just<00:02:17.840> a<00:02:17.930> lot<00:02:18.170> of

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.230 
of my body so there's just a lot of

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:20.860 
of my body so there's just a lot of
information<00:02:19.100> that<00:02:19.670> I'm<00:02:19.880> getting<00:02:20.330> that<00:02:20.450> I<00:02:20.510> lose

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:20.870 
information that I'm getting that I lose

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:23.470 
information that I'm getting that I lose
when<00:02:21.650> it's<00:02:21.860> out<00:02:22.040> here<00:02:22.400> attached<00:02:22.940> to<00:02:22.970> the<00:02:23.180> floor

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:23.480 
when it's out here attached to the floor

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.300 
when it's out here attached to the floor
and<00:02:23.990> I<00:02:24.080> think<00:02:24.290> it's<00:02:24.470> similar<00:02:24.770> on<00:02:24.890> the<00:02:24.920> violin

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:25.310 
and I think it's similar on the violin

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:26.950 
and I think it's similar on the violin
yeah<00:02:25.520> what<00:02:25.700> happens<00:02:26.090> you<00:02:26.360> discover<00:02:26.750> when<00:02:26.930> you

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:26.960 
yeah what happens you discover when you

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:28.420 
yeah what happens you discover when you
play<00:02:27.290> this<00:02:27.470> instrument<00:02:27.890> which<00:02:28.010> you<00:02:28.130> realize

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430 
play this instrument which you realize

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:31.030 
play this instrument which you realize
of<00:02:28.460> course<00:02:28.760> this<00:02:29.420> was<00:02:29.780> the<00:02:30.110> the<00:02:30.710> technique

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.040 
of course this was the the technique

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:32.140 
of course this was the the technique
playing<00:02:31.310> these<00:02:31.430> instruments<00:02:31.490> was<00:02:32.030> the

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.150 
playing these instruments was the

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:34.390 
playing these instruments was the
genesis<00:02:32.720> for<00:02:32.870> all<00:02:33.230> modern<00:02:33.560> schools<00:02:33.950> of<00:02:34.100> violin

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:34.400 
genesis for all modern schools of violin

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:37.290 
genesis for all modern schools of violin
playing<00:02:34.610> so<00:02:35.300> if<00:02:35.570> anybody<00:02:36.050> is<00:02:36.290> interested<00:02:36.410> in

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:37.300 
playing so if anybody is interested in

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:39.280 
playing so if anybody is interested in
studying<00:02:38.300> learning<00:02:38.720> how<00:02:38.930> to<00:02:38.960> play<00:02:39.170> the

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.290 
studying learning how to play the

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:40.690 
studying learning how to play the
historic<00:02:39.620> instruments<00:02:40.010> I<00:02:40.070> can<00:02:40.280> guarantee<00:02:40.580> you

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:40.700 
historic instruments I can guarantee you

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:43.270 
historic instruments I can guarantee you
it<00:02:40.820> will<00:02:40.940> only<00:02:41.090> improve<00:02:41.540> your<00:02:41.660> modern<00:02:42.140> play<00:02:42.350> so

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280 
it will only improve your modern play so

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:45.130 
it will only improve your modern play so
don't<00:02:43.490> be<00:02:43.580> afraid<00:02:43.790> of<00:02:43.910> it<00:02:44.120> it's<00:02:44.360> really<00:02:44.690> the<00:02:44.990> it

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:45.140 
don't be afraid of it it's really the it

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:46.510 
don't be afraid of it it's really the it
is<00:02:45.260> the<00:02:45.410> source<00:02:45.650> of<00:02:45.770> all<00:02:45.920> the<00:02:46.100> great<00:02:46.190> things

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:46.520 
is the source of all the great things

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:49.060 
is the source of all the great things
that<00:02:46.580> you<00:02:46.700> do<00:02:46.940> as<00:02:47.090> modern<00:02:47.390> players<00:02:47.920> but<00:02:48.920> what

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:49.070 
that you do as modern players but what

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:51.820 
that you do as modern players but what
you<00:02:49.190> discover<00:02:49.670> is<00:02:50.000> that<00:02:50.180> you<00:02:50.840> actually<00:02:51.440> become

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:51.830 
you discover is that you actually become

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:54.340 
you discover is that you actually become
I<00:02:52.190> think<00:02:52.700> more<00:02:53.000> of<00:02:53.030> the<00:02:53.300> mechanics<00:02:54.020> of<00:02:54.230> the

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:54.350 
I think more of the mechanics of the

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:56.620 
I think more of the mechanics of the
machinery<00:02:54.709> of<00:02:54.920> the<00:02:55.130> actual<00:02:55.459> instrument<00:02:55.760> so

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:56.630 
machinery of the actual instrument so

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:58.180 
machinery of the actual instrument so
that<00:02:56.660> there<00:02:57.050> really<00:02:57.260> is<00:02:57.530> a<00:02:57.560> sense<00:02:57.830> that<00:02:58.010> the

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:58.190 
that there really is a sense that the

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:00.580 
that there really is a sense that the
bow<00:02:58.370> starts<00:02:58.850> here<00:02:59.360> but<00:02:59.510> the<00:02:59.840> best<00:03:00.110> part<00:03:00.410> of<00:03:00.470> the

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:00.590 
bow starts here but the best part of the

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:03.100 
bow starts here but the best part of the
bow<00:03:00.739> is<00:03:00.980> from<00:03:01.280> here<00:03:01.550> to<00:03:01.610> here<00:03:01.700> and<00:03:02.150> so<00:03:02.239> you're

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:03.110 
bow is from here to here and so you're

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:06.580 
bow is from here to here and so you're
using<00:03:03.380> a<00:03:03.650> lot<00:03:03.950> more<00:03:03.980> of<00:03:04.480> this<00:03:05.480> machine<00:03:06.140> in<00:03:06.440> the

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:06.590 
using a lot more of this machine in the

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:09.570 
using a lot more of this machine in the
design<00:03:06.890> of<00:03:06.920> the<00:03:07.070> bow<00:03:07.220> and<00:03:07.459> it's<00:03:08.120> really<00:03:08.959> about

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:09.580 
design of the bow and it's really about

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:12.009 
design of the bow and it's really about
making<00:03:10.580> the<00:03:10.670> sound<00:03:10.910> production<00:03:11.180> is<00:03:11.630> really

00:03:12.009 --> 00:03:12.019 
making the sound production is really

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:14.380 
making the sound production is really
more<00:03:12.200> about<00:03:12.350> just<00:03:12.800> arm<00:03:13.100> weight<00:03:13.489> rather<00:03:14.150> than

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:14.390 
more about just arm weight rather than

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:16.420 
more about just arm weight rather than
pressure<00:03:14.660> if<00:03:14.959> you<00:03:14.989> press<00:03:15.380> the<00:03:15.620> instrument<00:03:16.130> and

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:16.430 
pressure if you press the instrument and

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:19.000 
pressure if you press the instrument and
try<00:03:17.269> and<00:03:17.420> force<00:03:17.690> the<00:03:17.840> sound<00:03:18.110> it's<00:03:18.709> going<00:03:18.950> to

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:19.010 
try and force the sound it's going to

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:20.590 
try and force the sound it's going to
squish<00:03:19.220> it<00:03:19.400> so<00:03:20.000> and<00:03:20.150> the<00:03:20.239> other<00:03:20.269> thing<00:03:20.450> that

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:20.600 
squish it so and the other thing that

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:22.810 
squish it so and the other thing that
happens<00:03:21.019> when<00:03:21.440> there's<00:03:21.739> a<00:03:21.800> whole<00:03:22.100> kind<00:03:22.760> of

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:22.820 
happens when there's a whole kind of

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:24.940 
happens when there's a whole kind of
pallet<00:03:23.300> of<00:03:23.390> what<00:03:23.540> we<00:03:23.630> call<00:03:23.810> bowing<00:03:24.230> vocabulary

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:24.950 
pallet of what we call bowing vocabulary

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:26.320 
pallet of what we call bowing vocabulary
and<00:03:25.340> one<00:03:26.090> of<00:03:26.150> the

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:26.330 
and one of the

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:29.050 
and one of the
first<00:03:26.510> things<00:03:26.780> that<00:03:26.870> we<00:03:27.020> discover<00:03:27.440> is<00:03:27.940> what<00:03:28.940> we

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:29.060 
first things that we discover is what we

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:31.900 
first things that we discover is what we
call<00:03:29.210> multiple<00:03:29.540> bow<00:03:30.050> gestures<00:03:30.650> so<00:03:31.430> the<00:03:31.640> bow

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:31.910 
call multiple bow gestures so the bow

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:34.360 
call multiple bow gestures so the bow
which<00:03:32.360> is<00:03:32.390> hat<00:03:32.930> is<00:03:33.140> lighter<00:03:33.500> and<00:03:33.650> obviously

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:34.370 
which is hat is lighter and obviously

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:37.600 
which is hat is lighter and obviously
lighter<00:03:34.670> at<00:03:34.850> the<00:03:34.880> tip<00:03:35.210> is<00:03:35.990> easily<00:03:36.770> rebound<00:03:37.310> so

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:37.610 
lighter at the tip is easily rebound so

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:39.630 
lighter at the tip is easily rebound so
like<00:03:37.970> when<00:03:38.120> you<00:03:38.210> drop<00:03:38.450> the<00:03:38.480> ball<00:03:38.810> on<00:03:39.080> the<00:03:39.350> floor

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:39.640 
like when you drop the ball on the floor

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:42.850 
like when you drop the ball on the floor
the<00:03:40.640> floor<00:03:41.150> hits<00:03:41.990> it<00:03:42.140> back<00:03:42.260> but<00:03:42.500> it's<00:03:42.650> not<00:03:42.830> a

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:42.860 
the floor hits it back but it's not a

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:45.990 
the floor hits it back but it's not a
separate<00:03:43.250> gesture<00:03:43.670> so<00:03:44.210> the<00:03:44.360> dot<00:03:44.540> on<00:03:44.690> the<00:03:44.720> up

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:46.000 
separate gesture so the dot on the up

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.480 
separate gesture so the dot on the up
become<00:03:47.000> a<00:03:47.030> single<00:03:47.450> gesture<00:03:47.690> and<00:03:48.110> so<00:03:49.100> when<00:03:49.370> you

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:49.490 
become a single gesture and so when you

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:51.220 
become a single gesture and so when you
see<00:03:49.700> and<00:03:50.060> you<00:03:50.180> see<00:03:50.210> two<00:03:50.600> eighth<00:03:50.780> notes<00:03:50.810> on<00:03:51.170> the

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:51.230 
see and you see two eighth notes on the

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:55.000 
see and you see two eighth notes on the
page<00:03:51.530> if<00:03:51.830> we're<00:03:51.950> used<00:03:52.100> to<00:03:52.190> 20<00:03:52.780> down<00:03:53.780> up<00:03:54.110> it<00:03:54.800> can

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:55.010 
page if we're used to 20 down up it can

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:56.440 
page if we're used to 20 down up it can
be<00:03:55.160> one<00:03:55.550> of<00:03:55.610> the<00:03:55.700> first<00:03:55.880> things<00:03:56.060> you<00:03:56.150> discover

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:56.450 
be one of the first things you discover

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:58.000 
be one of the first things you discover
in<00:03:56.600> Baroque<00:03:56.810> music<00:03:56.840> that<00:03:57.290> it's<00:03:57.440> really<00:03:57.770> one

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:58.010 
in Baroque music that it's really one

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:01.690 
in Baroque music that it's really one
note<00:03:58.780> with<00:03:59.780> a<00:03:59.810> rebound<00:04:00.230> and<00:04:01.070> that<00:04:01.220> then<00:04:01.490> gets

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:01.700 
note with a rebound and that then gets

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:06.490 
note with a rebound and that then gets
compounded<00:04:02.660> it<00:04:03.110> can<00:04:03.260> be<00:04:03.380> three<00:04:04.240> etc<00:04:05.470> so<00:04:06.470> I

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:06.500 
compounded it can be three etc so I

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:09.100 
compounded it can be three etc so I
think<00:04:06.740> what
