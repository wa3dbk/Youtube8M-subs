you<00:00:15.509> can<00:00:15.540> clearly<00:00:16.139> see<00:00:16.289> the<00:00:16.500> difference<00:00:16.980> on

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
you can clearly see the difference on

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:19.550 
you can clearly see the difference on
the<00:00:17.699> screen<00:00:18.000> it<00:00:18.359> is<00:00:18.570> has<00:00:18.840> a<00:00:18.869> much<00:00:19.140> much<00:00:19.350> higher

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
the screen it is has a much much higher

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.429 
the screen it is has a much much higher
resolution<00:00:20.189> and<00:00:20.730> it<00:00:20.880> was<00:00:21.000> really<00:00:21.510> really<00:00:21.810> much

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
resolution and it was really really much

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:24.890 
resolution and it was really really much
better<00:00:22.470> even<00:00:23.340> though<00:00:23.430> they're<00:00:23.670> 10.1<00:00:24.539> looks

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
better even though they're 10.1 looks

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.670 
better even though they're 10.1 looks
smaller<00:00:25.380> due<00:00:25.949> to<00:00:26.189> the<00:00:26.340> Upton<00:00:27.119> to<00:00:27.869> the<00:00:27.900> 16<00:00:28.349> 29

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
smaller due to the Upton to the 16 29

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.510 
smaller due to the Upton to the 16 29
screen<00:00:29.840> layout<00:00:30.840> it's<00:00:31.500> actually<00:00:31.949> bigger

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
screen layout it's actually bigger

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.290 
screen layout it's actually bigger
because<00:00:33.090> it's<00:00:33.570> wider<00:00:34.140> so<00:00:34.590> you<00:00:34.649> can<00:00:34.860> see<00:00:35.040> here

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:35.300 
because it's wider so you can see here

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:40.430 
because it's wider so you can see here
ipad<00:00:36.300> 2<00:00:37.579> is<00:00:38.579> actually<00:00:39.090> a<00:00:39.329> little<00:00:39.570> bit<00:00:39.809> even

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
ipad 2 is actually a little bit even

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.069 
ipad 2 is actually a little bit even
thicker<00:00:40.950> you<00:00:41.430> can<00:00:41.610> see<00:00:42.270> it<00:00:42.390> right<00:00:42.570> here<00:00:42.629> but

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
thicker you can see it right here but

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:44.690 
thicker you can see it right here but
let's<00:00:43.320> take<00:00:43.500> a<00:00:43.530> closer<00:00:43.770> look<00:00:43.890> at<00:00:44.129> the<00:00:44.250> very

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
let's take a closer look at the very

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.400 
let's take a closer look at the very
same<00:00:45.000> how<00:00:45.210> it<00:00:45.629> performs<00:00:46.050> two<00:00:46.140> different

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
same how it performs two different

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.300 
same how it performs two different
applications<00:00:46.950> so<00:00:47.550> let's<00:00:47.730> go<00:00:48.239> outside

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:50.310 
applications so let's go outside

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:59.540 
applications so let's go outside
I<00:00:50.400> think<00:00:50.880> I<00:00:50.970> just<00:00:51.000> kill<00:00:51.420> the<00:00:51.570> Android<00:00:51.900> again<00:00:58.550> is

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
I think I just kill the Android again is

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.580 
I think I just kill the Android again is
only<00:00:59.730> be<00:01:00.510> production<00:01:00.900> surface<00:01:01.260> or<00:01:01.440> this

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
only be production surface or this

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.640 
only be production surface or this
happens<00:01:01.920> sometimes<00:01:02.010> it's<00:01:02.970> really<00:01:03.660> fast<00:01:03.930> and

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
happens sometimes it's really fast and

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.200 
happens sometimes it's really fast and
if<00:01:04.949> you<00:01:05.040> just<00:01:05.160> go<00:01:05.370> into<00:01:05.550> the<00:01:05.610> gallery<00:01:05.820> and

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
if you just go into the gallery and

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.660 
if you just go into the gallery and
maybe<00:01:06.720> open<00:01:07.050> up<00:01:07.110> a<00:01:07.230> picture<00:01:07.620> of<00:01:08.400> course

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
maybe open up a picture of course

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:09.890 
maybe open up a picture of course
there's<00:01:08.850> no<00:01:08.880> picture<00:01:09.210> rainbow<00:01:09.480> let's<00:01:09.720> maybe

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
there's no picture rainbow let's maybe

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.390 
there's no picture rainbow let's maybe
then<00:01:10.140> shoot<00:01:10.440> a<00:01:10.530> picture<00:01:10.710> let's<00:01:11.010> open<00:01:11.280> the

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
then shoot a picture let's open the

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.060 
then shoot a picture let's open the
camera<00:01:12.060> and<00:01:12.390> check<00:01:12.900> out<00:01:13.080> the<00:01:13.260> resolution<00:01:14.040> on

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
camera and check out the resolution on

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.720 
camera and check out the resolution on
that<00:01:14.280> one<00:01:14.460> it's<00:01:15.210> kind<00:01:15.540> of<00:01:15.690> slow<00:01:16.680> and<00:01:16.710> like<00:01:17.070> on

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:17.730 
that one it's kind of slow and like on

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:21.340 
that one it's kind of slow and like on
the<00:01:17.850> ipad<00:01:18.210> 2<00:01:18.630> not<00:01:18.900> the<00:01:19.470> best<00:01:19.740> but<00:01:20.070> diverse<00:01:20.730> for

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:18.940 
see we have some plastic design that

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:21.120 
see we have some plastic design that
looks<00:02:19.060> actually<00:02:19.540> much<00:02:19.900> better<00:02:20.470> and<00:02:20.740> it<00:02:20.860> feels

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:21.130 
looks actually much better and it feels

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:22.680 
looks actually much better and it feels
better<00:02:21.310> than<00:02:21.580> the<00:02:21.790> attitude<00:02:22.240> because<00:02:22.510> it's

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:22.690 
better than the attitude because it's

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:24.960 
better than the attitude because it's
not<00:02:22.900> slippery<00:02:23.410> and<00:02:23.890> outside<00:02:24.340> its<00:02:24.580> aluminium
