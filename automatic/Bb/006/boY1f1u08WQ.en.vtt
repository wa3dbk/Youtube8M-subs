weighing out our dry ingredients so here

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.380 
weighing out our dry ingredients so here
I<00:00:33.960> have<00:00:34.110> some<00:00:34.469> kosher<00:00:34.680> salt<00:00:34.890> some<00:00:35.190> sugar<00:00:35.610> some

I have some kosher salt some sugar some

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.270 
I have some kosher salt some sugar some
white<00:00:36.630> pepper<00:00:36.930> and<00:00:37.380> the<00:00:37.680> percentage<00:00:38.190> you<00:00:38.250> see

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
white pepper and the percentage you see

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.250 
white pepper and the percentage you see
to<00:00:38.579> the<00:00:38.700> right<00:00:38.730> of<00:00:39.180> the<00:00:39.329> actual<00:00:39.870> weights<00:00:40.110> that

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
to the right of the actual weights that

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.110 
to the right of the actual weights that
I'm<00:00:40.410> using<00:00:40.590> is<00:00:40.829> the<00:00:41.129> percentage<00:00:41.579> based<00:00:41.879> upon

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
I'm using is the percentage based upon

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:43.610 
I'm using is the percentage based upon
the<00:00:42.239> total<00:00:42.510> weight<00:00:42.719> of<00:00:42.750> the<00:00:42.870> Sam<00:00:43.200> which<00:00:43.410> is<00:00:43.530> a

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
the total weight of the Sam which is a

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.229 
the total weight of the Sam which is a
thousand<00:00:44.160> grams<00:00:44.399> we're<00:00:44.670> basically<00:00:44.850> setting

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
thousand grams we're basically setting

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:46.850 
thousand grams we're basically setting
the<00:00:45.360> salmon<00:00:45.719> weight<00:00:45.899> at<00:00:46.079> a<00:00:46.140> hundred<00:00:46.770> percent

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
the salmon weight at a hundred percent

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.100 
the salmon weight at a hundred percent
and<00:00:47.250> we're<00:00:47.430> calculating<00:00:47.700> based<00:00:48.239> on<00:00:48.480> that<00:00:48.930> just

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
and we're calculating based on that just

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.680 
and we're calculating based on that just
to<00:00:49.170> give<00:00:49.350> you<00:00:49.440> a<00:00:49.469> ratio<00:00:49.829> idea<00:00:50.489> so<00:00:51.090> two<00:00:51.270> grams<00:00:51.539> of

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
to give you a ratio idea so two grams of

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.569 
to give you a ratio idea so two grams of
sodium<00:00:51.840> nitrite<00:00:52.379> which<00:00:52.530> is<00:00:52.710> the<00:00:53.039> nitrite<00:00:53.460> is

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
sodium nitrite which is the nitrite is

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.639 
sodium nitrite which is the nitrite is
nice<00:00:53.760> to<00:00:54.059> both<00:00:54.180> retain<00:00:54.600> that<00:00:54.780> pink<00:00:55.079> rosy<00:00:55.410> color

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
nice to both retain that pink rosy color

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.439 
nice to both retain that pink rosy color
during<00:00:55.949> the<00:00:56.039> cooking<00:00:56.219> process<00:00:56.340> and<00:00:56.850> also<00:00:57.270> adds

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
during the cooking process and also adds

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:00.410 
during the cooking process and also adds
a<00:00:57.719> cured<00:00:58.140> flavor<00:00:58.710> so<00:00:59.579> I'm<00:00:59.699> going<00:00:59.910> to<00:01:00.030> place<00:01:00.239> the

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
a cured flavor so I'm going to place the

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.479 
a cured flavor so I'm going to place the
salmon<00:01:00.780> belly<00:01:01.079> which<00:01:01.350> is<00:01:01.379> a<00:01:01.559> thousand<00:01:02.280> grams

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
salmon belly which is a thousand grams

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:03.979 
salmon belly which is a thousand grams
or<00:01:02.730> one<00:01:02.910> hundred<00:01:03.149> percent<00:01:03.270> based<00:01:03.629> upon<00:01:03.809> our

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
or one hundred percent based upon our

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.830 
or one hundred percent based upon our
ratios<00:01:04.379> into<00:01:05.280> a<00:01:05.309> vacuum<00:01:05.850> bag<00:01:05.880> on<00:01:06.360> the<00:01:06.540> scale

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
ratios into a vacuum bag on the scale

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.620 
ratios into a vacuum bag on the scale
and<00:01:07.080> for<00:01:08.040> every<00:01:08.220> thousand<00:01:08.640> grams<00:01:08.820> of<00:01:09.030> salmon

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
and for every thousand grams of salmon

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.480 
and for every thousand grams of salmon
and<00:01:10.020> it's<00:01:10.170> corresponding<00:01:10.470> ingredients<00:01:11.430> is

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
and it's corresponding ingredients is

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.520 
and it's corresponding ingredients is
going<00:01:11.700> to<00:01:11.820> fit<00:01:12.030> into<00:01:12.210> one<00:01:12.540> ten<00:01:12.840> by<00:01:12.990> six<00:01:13.020> inch

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
going to fit into one ten by six inch

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.020 
going to fit into one ten by six inch
vacuum<00:01:13.710> bag<00:01:14.070> so<00:01:14.460> I'm<00:01:14.520> going<00:01:14.640> to<00:01:14.670> show<00:01:14.820> you<00:01:14.850> how

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
vacuum bag so I'm going to show you how

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.289 
vacuum bag so I'm going to show you how
to<00:01:15.090> do<00:01:15.479> this<00:01:15.750> rillette<00:01:16.380> both<00:01:16.759> Suvi<00:01:17.759> process

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
to do this rillette both Suvi process

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.359 
to do this rillette both Suvi process
and<00:01:18.479> also<00:01:18.780> the<00:01:18.960> standard<00:01:19.380> classic<00:01:19.890> poaching

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
and also the standard classic poaching

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.760 
and also the standard classic poaching
process<00:01:20.909> but<00:01:21.479> I<00:01:21.509> prefer<00:01:21.900> Suvi<00:01:22.290> so<00:01:22.470> if<00:01:22.560> you<00:01:22.619> have

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
process but I prefer Suvi so if you have

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.789 
process but I prefer Suvi so if you have
an<00:01:22.890> emergency<00:01:23.009> later<00:01:23.670> and<00:01:23.939> a<00:01:24.290> vacuum<00:01:25.290> sealer

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
an emergency later and a vacuum sealer

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:27.890 
an emergency later and a vacuum sealer
that's<00:01:26.009> kind<00:01:26.250> of<00:01:26.310> the<00:01:26.369> way<00:01:26.520> to<00:01:26.549> go<00:01:26.880> I<00:01:27.150> think<00:01:27.600> you

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
that's kind of the way to go I think you

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.080 
that's kind of the way to go I think you
have<00:01:28.110> a<00:01:28.350> better<00:01:28.950> outcome<00:01:29.430> on<00:01:29.759> the<00:01:29.790> overall

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
have a better outcome on the overall

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.390 
have a better outcome on the overall
flavor<00:01:30.509> but<00:01:31.290> the<00:01:31.500> traditional<00:01:31.979> poaching

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
flavor but the traditional poaching

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.219 
flavor but the traditional poaching
method<00:01:32.640> is<00:01:32.729> fine<00:01:32.939> too<00:01:33.240> so<00:01:33.750> basically<00:01:34.020> what<00:01:34.170> I'm

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
method is fine too so basically what I'm

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:35.450 
method is fine too so basically what I'm
doing<00:01:34.290> here<00:01:34.590> is<00:01:34.680> all<00:01:34.829> the<00:01:34.979> ingredients<00:01:35.070> in<00:01:35.369> the

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
doing here is all the ingredients in the

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.069 
doing here is all the ingredients in the
bag<00:01:35.610> you<00:01:35.820> have<00:01:36.000> your<00:01:36.180> white<00:01:36.360> wine<00:01:36.570> your<00:01:36.840> butter

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
bag you have your white wine your butter

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:39.710 
bag you have your white wine your butter
and<00:01:37.350> your<00:01:37.890> dry<00:01:38.460> ingredients<00:01:39.420> you<00:01:39.479> want<00:01:39.600> to

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
and your dry ingredients you want to

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
ingredients so they disperse evenly

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.240

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:21.500 
minute cooking time in the oven go ahead
and<00:03:19.680> pull<00:03:19.920> it<00:03:20.040> out<00:03:20.100> and<00:03:20.310> you'll<00:03:20.850> see<00:03:21.150> that<00:03:21.390> we

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:21.510 
and pull it out and you'll see that we

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:23.570 
and pull it out and you'll see that we
kind<00:03:21.810> of<00:03:21.960> achieve<00:03:22.290> the<00:03:22.440> same<00:03:22.710> results<00:03:23.130> whether

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:23.580 
kind of achieve the same results whether

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:26.450 
kind of achieve the same results whether
we<00:03:23.820> baked<00:03:24.420> it<00:03:24.600> in<00:03:24.750> the<00:03:24.810> oven<00:03:24.930> or<00:03:25.290> cooked<00:03:26.190> it<00:03:26.340> in

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:26.460 
we baked it in the oven or cooked it in

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:29.090 
we baked it in the oven or cooked it in
the<00:03:26.520> sous-vide<00:03:27.420> bag<00:03:27.480> when<00:03:28.290> we<00:03:28.410> pour<00:03:28.710> into<00:03:28.980> our

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:29.100 
the sous-vide bag when we pour into our

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:31.730 
the sous-vide bag when we pour into our
mixing<00:03:29.670> bowl<00:03:29.750> but<00:03:30.750> again<00:03:30.990> I<00:03:31.200> think<00:03:31.560> that

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:31.740 
mixing bowl but again I think that

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:32.990 
mixing bowl but again I think that
there's<00:03:31.950> you<00:03:32.160> know<00:03:32.220> I've<00:03:32.340> done<00:03:32.460> side<00:03:32.700> by<00:03:32.820> side

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 
there's you know I've done side by side

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.090 
there's you know I've done side by side
tests<00:03:33.270> and<00:03:33.510> I<00:03:33.600> prefer<00:03:33.930> the<00:03:33.960> Suvi<00:03:34.440> method<00:03:34.800> only

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:35.100 
tests and I prefer the Suvi method only

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:36.920 
tests and I prefer the Suvi method only
because<00:03:35.550> it's<00:03:35.700> a<00:03:35.760> lot<00:03:35.970> easier<00:03:36.210> it's<00:03:36.780> a<00:03:36.810> lot

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
because it's a lot easier it's a lot

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:39.740 
because it's a lot easier it's a lot
more<00:03:37.050> forgiving<00:03:37.620> than<00:03:37.770> baking<00:03:38.420> because<00:03:39.420> every

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:39.750 
more forgiving than baking because every

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:41.660 
more forgiving than baking because every
oven<00:03:39.780> is<00:03:40.020> different<00:03:40.110> but<00:03:40.830> also<00:03:41.100> -<00:03:41.160> I<00:03:41.310> feel<00:03:41.640> like

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:41.670 
oven is different but also - I feel like

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:43.820 
oven is different but also - I feel like
you<00:03:41.880> get<00:03:42.000> a<00:03:42.030> little<00:03:42.270> bit<00:03:42.360> less<00:03:42.570> flavor<00:03:42.930> loss<00:03:43.260> so

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:43.830 
you get a little bit less flavor loss so

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:44.990 
you get a little bit less flavor loss so
either<00:03:44.040> way<00:03:44.250> we're<00:03:44.430> going<00:03:44.520> to<00:03:44.580> go<00:03:44.700> ahead<00:03:44.790> and

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:45.000 
either way we're going to go ahead and

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.180 
either way we're going to go ahead and
place<00:03:45.240> both<00:03:45.900> our<00:03:46.110> poached<00:03:46.410> version<00:03:46.890> and<00:03:47.070> our

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:47.190

little chop and now using some gloves
I'm<00:04:23.669> going<00:04:23.910> to<00:04:24.090> hand<00:04:24.600> mix<00:04:24.900> and<00:04:25.080> you<00:04:25.140> want<00:04:25.290> a

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:25.350 
I'm going to hand mix and you want a

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:26.910 
hand mix this while it's still warm

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:27.490 
hand mix this while it's still warm
that's

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:27.500 
that's

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:29.380 
that's
important<00:04:28.010> so<00:04:28.490> while<00:04:28.670> the<00:04:28.790> liquid<00:04:29.000> is<00:04:29.240> still

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:29.390 
important so while the liquid is still

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:32.610 
important so while the liquid is still
fluid<00:04:29.720> and<00:04:30.050> warm<00:04:30.350> you<00:04:30.920> want<00:04:31.100> to<00:04:31.190> mix<00:04:31.400> by<00:04:31.640> hand

turning it into little flakes but you
don't<00:04:35.390> want<00:04:35.510> to<00:04:35.570> mix<00:04:35.690> it<00:04:35.840> so<00:04:35.960> much<00:04:36.110> that<00:04:36.350> turns

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:36.590 
don't want to mix it so much that turns

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:38.860 
don't want to mix it so much that turns
into<00:04:36.860> a<00:04:37.310> pace<00:04:37.970> you<00:04:38.180> want<00:04:38.390> to<00:04:38.480> have<00:04:38.630> some

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:55.670 
olive oil butter isn't a good idea

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:57.850 
olive oil butter isn't a good idea
because<00:04:56.120> butter<00:04:56.540> will<00:04:56.750> turn<00:04:56.990> to<00:04:57.230> solid<00:04:57.770> and

00:04:57.850 --> 00:04:57.860 
because butter will turn to solid and

00:04:57.860 --> 00:04:59.110 
because butter will turn to solid and
you're<00:04:57.950> gonna<00:04:58.040> have<00:04:58.190> a<00:04:58.220> hard<00:04:58.460> time<00:04:58.520> on<00:04:58.760> molding

00:04:59.110 --> 00:04:59.120 
you're gonna have a hard time on molding

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:02.140 
you're gonna have a hard time on molding
it<00:04:59.210> but<00:04:59.690> I<00:04:59.720> prefer<00:05:00.050> just<00:05:00.890> the<00:05:01.070> regular<00:05:01.760> spray

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:02.150 
it but I prefer just the regular spray

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:04.390 
it but I prefer just the regular spray
oil<00:05:02.419> and<00:05:02.660> nonstick<00:05:02.930> spray<00:05:03.110> oil<00:05:03.380> and<00:05:03.590> then<00:05:04.310> I'm

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:04.400 
oil and nonstick spray oil and then I'm

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:06.670 
oil and nonstick spray oil and then I'm
going<00:05:04.550> to<00:05:04.640> give<00:05:05.480> the<00:05:05.660> salmon<00:05:06.140> rillette

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:06.680 
going to give the salmon rillette

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:08.650 
going to give the salmon rillette
mixture<00:05:07.100> a<00:05:07.130> good<00:05:07.340> stir<00:05:07.730> every<00:05:08.180> single<00:05:08.480> time

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:08.660 
mixture a good stir every single time

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:11.140 
mixture a good stir every single time
before<00:05:08.780> I<00:05:08.990> load<00:05:09.350> it<00:05:09.380> into<00:05:09.650> the<00:05:09.919> ramekin<00:05:10.400> load

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:11.150 
before I load it into the ramekin load

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:12.850 
before I load it into the ramekin load
it<00:05:11.270> almost<00:05:11.540> all<00:05:11.750> the<00:05:11.990> way<00:05:12.110> to<00:05:12.169> the<00:05:12.410> top<00:05:12.650> and

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:12.860 
it almost all the way to the top and

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:14.590 
it almost all the way to the top and
then<00:05:12.980> pack<00:05:13.280> it<00:05:13.310> down<00:05:13.610> with<00:05:13.730> a<00:05:13.820> spoon<00:05:13.850> so<00:05:14.330> I<00:05:14.390> have

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:14.600 
then pack it down with a spoon so I have

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:16.930 
then pack it down with a spoon so I have
a<00:05:14.630> nice<00:05:14.900> even<00:05:15.140> layer<00:05:15.440> and<00:05:15.860> when<00:05:16.460> filling<00:05:16.850> the

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:16.940 
a nice even layer and when filling the

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:18.010 
a nice even layer and when filling the
ramekins<00:05:17.330> you<00:05:17.419> want<00:05:17.570> to<00:05:17.630> make<00:05:17.720> sure<00:05:17.750> that<00:05:17.960> you

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:18.020 
ramekins you want to make sure that you

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:20.080 
ramekins you want to make sure that you
leave<00:05:18.230> just<00:05:18.560> a<00:05:18.650> little<00:05:18.680> space<00:05:19.130> on<00:05:19.310> top<00:05:19.640> maybe

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:20.090 
leave just a little space on top maybe

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:22.420 
leave just a little space on top maybe
like<00:05:20.450> a<00:05:20.480> centimeter<00:05:21.020> or<00:05:21.200> two<00:05:21.230> so<00:05:22.010> you<00:05:22.070> can<00:05:22.280> go

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:22.430 
like a centimeter or two so you can go

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:25.180 
like a centimeter or two so you can go
back<00:05:22.610> and<00:05:22.790> cap<00:05:23.120> it<00:05:23.360> with<00:05:23.390> clarified<00:05:24.290> butter<00:05:24.560> so

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:25.190 
back and cap it with clarified butter so

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:27.520 
back and cap it with clarified butter so
here<00:05:25.460> I<00:05:25.490> have<00:05:25.580> warm<00:05:26.060> clarified<00:05:26.600> butter<00:05:26.840> I'm

I'm<00:06:22.580> going<00:06:22.669> to<00:06:22.760> cut<00:06:22.910> it<00:06:23.000> in<00:06:23.090> half<00:06:23.120> because<00:06:23.450> a

I'm going to cut it in half because a

00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:26.950 
I'm going to cut it in half because a

00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:26.960 
full ramekin portion is kind of a lot so

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:28.480 
full ramekin portion is kind of a lot so
I<00:06:27.169> usually<00:06:27.500> cut<00:06:27.800> the<00:06:27.950> six<00:06:28.160> ounce<00:06:28.340> ramekins
