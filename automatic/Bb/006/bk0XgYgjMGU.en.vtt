so<00:00:00.620> behind<00:00:01.620> me<00:00:01.740> you<00:00:01.829> can<00:00:01.890> see<00:00:02.010> my<00:00:02.700> observatory

00:00:03.139 --> 00:00:03.149 
so behind me you can see my observatory

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:04.370 
so behind me you can see my observatory
that<00:00:03.179> I've<00:00:03.449> built<00:00:03.689> here<00:00:03.750> my<00:00:03.990> garden<00:00:04.290> in

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:04.380 
that I've built here my garden in

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:06.380 
that I've built here my garden in
Wiltshire<00:00:04.710> but<00:00:05.310> typically<00:00:05.670> most<00:00:05.700> people<00:00:06.270> if

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:06.390 
Wiltshire but typically most people if

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:07.880 
Wiltshire but typically most people if
they're<00:00:06.540> doing<00:00:06.690> solar<00:00:06.930> observing<00:00:07.470> will<00:00:07.710> just

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:07.890 
they're doing solar observing will just

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:09.830 
they're doing solar observing will just
use<00:00:08.040> a<00:00:08.069> standard<00:00:08.340> mount<00:00:08.700> setup<00:00:09.090> and<00:00:09.300> bring<00:00:09.719> it

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:09.840 
use a standard mount setup and bring it

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.140 
use a standard mount setup and bring it
out<00:00:09.900> into<00:00:10.110> the<00:00:10.230> sunshine<00:00:10.969> setting<00:00:11.969> up<00:00:12.059> the

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
out into the sunshine setting up the

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:13.879 
out into the sunshine setting up the
mountain<00:00:12.480> for<00:00:12.630> daytime<00:00:12.929> solar<00:00:13.170> observing<00:00:13.679> is

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
mountain for daytime solar observing is

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:15.079 
mountain for daytime solar observing is
exactly<00:00:14.309> the<00:00:14.429> same<00:00:14.580> as<00:00:14.730> you<00:00:14.790> would<00:00:14.940> for

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
exactly the same as you would for

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:16.910 
exactly the same as you would for
nighttime<00:00:15.269> observing<00:00:15.929> you<00:00:16.379> do<00:00:16.560> have<00:00:16.800> two

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
nighttime observing you do have two

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.230 
nighttime observing you do have two
polar<00:00:17.190> align<00:00:17.520> the<00:00:17.640> Mount<00:00:17.820> and<00:00:17.970> obviously

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
polar align the Mount and obviously

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:19.609 
polar align the Mount and obviously
that's<00:00:18.359> a<00:00:18.510> bit<00:00:18.630> more<00:00:18.779> tricky<00:00:18.930> in<00:00:19.170> the<00:00:19.260> daytime

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
that's a bit more tricky in the daytime

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:21.260 
that's a bit more tricky in the daytime
you<00:00:19.830> don't<00:00:20.039> have<00:00:20.189> Polaris<00:00:20.730> as<00:00:20.850> a<00:00:20.880> reference

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
you don't have Polaris as a reference

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.630 
you don't have Polaris as a reference
point<00:00:21.769> typically<00:00:22.769> what<00:00:22.890> most<00:00:22.920> people<00:00:23.400> will<00:00:23.490> do

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
point typically what most people will do

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.220 
point typically what most people will do
is<00:00:23.760> maybe<00:00:23.939> place<00:00:24.269> marking<00:00:24.750> points<00:00:25.019> on<00:00:25.140> the

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
is maybe place marking points on the

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:26.990 
is maybe place marking points on the
ground<00:00:25.470> where<00:00:25.680> the<00:00:25.710> Mount<00:00:26.010> is<00:00:26.189> allowing<00:00:26.849> to

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
ground where the Mount is allowing to

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000 
ground where the Mount is allowing to
north<00:00:27.210> or<00:00:27.630> you<00:00:27.930> could<00:00:28.050> use<00:00:28.199> a<00:00:28.230> compass<00:00:28.650> just<00:00:28.859> to

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
north or you could use a compass just to

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:30.830 
north or you could use a compass just to
set<00:00:29.160> a<00:00:29.189> rough<00:00:29.429> North<00:00:29.670> I'm<00:00:29.880> close<00:00:30.359> to<00:00:30.390> north<00:00:30.689> is

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
set a rough North I'm close to north is

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.709 
set a rough North I'm close to north is
okay<00:00:31.170> for<00:00:31.830> most<00:00:32.009> Sun<00:00:32.189> we're<00:00:32.309> observing<00:00:32.719> the

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
okay for most Sun we're observing the

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.720 
okay for most Sun we're observing the
mount<00:00:33.930> pointing<00:00:34.920> up<00:00:35.010> towards<00:00:35.160> the<00:00:35.370> north<00:00:35.579> and

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
mount pointing up towards the north and

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:36.860 
mount pointing up towards the north and
then<00:00:35.850> obviously<00:00:36.000> that<00:00:36.300> you've<00:00:36.390> got<00:00:36.540> the<00:00:36.630> Sun

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
then obviously that you've got the Sun

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.200 
then obviously that you've got the Sun
going<00:00:37.770> over<00:00:38.010> tracking<00:00:38.460> over<00:00:38.520> the<00:00:38.700> southern

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
going over tracking over the southern

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.090 
going over tracking over the southern
part<00:00:39.390> of<00:00:39.450> the<00:00:39.540> sky<00:00:39.750> depending<00:00:40.710> on<00:00:40.770> the<00:00:40.860> time<00:00:41.070> of

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
part of the sky depending on the time of

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.940 
part of the sky depending on the time of
year<00:00:41.370> obviously<00:00:42.290> higher<00:00:43.290> up<00:00:43.500> in<00:00:43.649> the<00:00:43.680> summer

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
year obviously higher up in the summer

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.250 
year obviously higher up in the summer
can<00:00:44.910> make<00:00:45.059> it<00:00:45.180> easy<00:00:45.329> to<00:00:45.510> observe<00:00:45.780> the<00:00:45.930> Sun<00:00:46.110> but

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
can make it easy to observe the Sun but

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:47.479 
can make it easy to observe the Sun but
also<00:00:46.440> you<00:00:46.649> have<00:00:46.890> to<00:00:47.070> take<00:00:47.250> into<00:00:47.460> account

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
also you have to take into account

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.580 
also you have to take into account
thermal<00:00:48.120> considerations<00:00:48.809> especially<00:00:49.530> if

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
thermal considerations especially if

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.040 
thermal considerations especially if
you're<00:00:49.800> in<00:00:49.980> a<00:00:50.190> more<00:00:51.090> urban<00:00:51.300> environment<00:00:51.570> where

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
you're in a more urban environment where

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.720 
you're in a more urban environment where
you've<00:00:52.140> got<00:00:52.260> a<00:00:52.289> lot<00:00:52.350> of<00:00:52.410> concrete<00:00:52.890> around<00:00:53.129> we

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
you've got a lot of concrete around we

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:54.950 
you've got a lot of concrete around we
can<00:00:53.850> get<00:00:53.969> a<00:00:54.000> lot<00:00:54.090> of<00:00:54.210> heat<00:00:54.420> coming<00:00:54.449> off<00:00:54.840> the

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
can get a lot of heat coming off the

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.500 
can get a lot of heat coming off the
ground<00:00:55.199> this<00:00:55.890> can<00:00:56.160> as<00:00:56.430> it<00:00:56.579> does<00:00:56.730> with<00:00:56.940> their

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
ground this can as it does with their

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.599 
ground this can as it does with their
evening<00:00:58.020> observing<00:00:58.500> affect<00:00:59.039> the<00:00:59.129> image<00:00:59.340> and

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
evening observing affect the image and

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.610 
evening observing affect the image and
seeing<00:00:59.940> is<00:01:00.120> a<00:01:00.149> factor<00:01:00.570> with<00:01:00.809> both<00:01:01.020> daytime<00:01:01.260> and

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
seeing is a factor with both daytime and

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.189 
seeing is a factor with both daytime and
at<00:01:01.949> night<00:01:02.010> time<00:01:02.219> reserving<00:01:02.899> scene<00:01:03.899> can<00:01:04.110> be

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
at night time reserving scene can be

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.020 
at night time reserving scene can be
more<00:01:04.379> critical<00:01:04.700> observing<00:01:05.700> the<00:01:05.790> Sun

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
more critical observing the Sun

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.880 
more critical observing the Sun
obviously<00:01:06.750> because<00:01:07.260> you've<00:01:07.380> got<00:01:07.560> a<00:01:07.590> lot<00:01:07.860> of

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
obviously because you've got a lot of

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.710 
obviously because you've got a lot of
heat<00:01:08.159> being<00:01:08.400> created<00:01:08.790> during<00:01:08.939> the<00:01:09.060> day<00:01:09.210> so

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
heat being created during the day so

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.780 
heat being created during the day so
most<00:01:10.530> solar<00:01:10.740> observers<00:01:11.189> tend<00:01:11.430> to<00:01:11.490> observe

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
most solar observers tend to observe

you<00:03:12.060> move<00:03:12.300> the<00:03:13.140> telescope<00:03:13.680> about<00:03:14.220> you'll

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970 
you move the telescope about you'll

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:16.340 
you move the telescope about you'll
gradually<00:03:15.300> begin<00:03:15.630> to<00:03:15.750> see<00:03:15.870> more<00:03:16.110> and<00:03:16.200> more<00:03:16.230> of

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:16.350 
gradually begin to see more and more of

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:17.900 
gradually begin to see more and more of
a<00:03:16.410> shadow<00:03:16.650> where<00:03:17.010> the<00:03:17.100> shadow<00:03:17.340> is<00:03:17.430> being<00:03:17.670> cast

here<00:03:18.209> and<00:03:18.680> you<00:03:19.680> can<00:03:19.829> see<00:03:19.980> just<00:03:20.010> in<00:03:20.340> here<00:03:20.610> a

00:03:20.979 --> 00:03:20.989 
here and you can see just in here a

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:24.020 
here and you can see just in here a
whiter<00:03:21.989> image<00:03:22.350> which<00:03:22.590> is<00:03:22.620> the<00:03:22.890> Sun<00:03:23.130> what<00:03:23.880> we're

whiter image which is the Sun what we're

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:26.030 
whiter image which is the Sun what we're
trying<00:03:24.209> to<00:03:24.299> do<00:03:24.510> is<00:03:24.780> maneuver<00:03:25.290> the<00:03:25.590> telescope

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040 
trying to do is maneuver the telescope

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:29.539 
trying to do is maneuver the telescope
until<00:03:26.730> that<00:03:27.269> white<00:03:27.870> image<00:03:28.230> of<00:03:28.350> the<00:03:28.470> Sun<00:03:28.680> it's

00:03:29.539 --> 00:03:29.549 
until that white image of the Sun it's

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:31.699 
until that white image of the Sun it's
exactly<00:03:30.120> over<00:03:30.600> the<00:03:30.690> white<00:03:30.840> disk<00:03:31.110> as<00:03:31.500> you<00:03:31.590> can

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:31.709 
exactly over the white disk as you can

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:34.009 
exactly over the white disk as you can
see<00:03:31.860> here<00:03:32.010> now<00:03:32.190> we<00:03:33.030> can<00:03:33.180> be<00:03:33.269> reasonably<00:03:33.690> happy

00:03:34.009 --> 00:03:34.019 
see here now we can be reasonably happy

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:36.740 
see here now we can be reasonably happy
and<00:03:34.670> confident<00:03:35.670> that<00:03:35.970> we<00:03:36.060> have<00:03:36.209> the<00:03:36.299> Sun<00:03:36.540> in
