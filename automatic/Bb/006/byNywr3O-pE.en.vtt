00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.440 
it just it almost looked like it were
like<00:01:17.770> we<00:01:17.920> dropped<00:01:18.160> syrup<00:01:18.700> on<00:01:19.030> the<00:01:19.210> ground

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:19.450 
like we dropped syrup on the ground

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:21.330 
like we dropped syrup on the ground
maybe<00:01:19.720> and<00:01:20.290> he's<00:01:20.500> been<00:01:20.710> cutting<00:01:21.070> it<00:01:21.190> with<00:01:21.280> a

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:21.340 
maybe and he's been cutting it with a

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:25.940 
maybe and he's been cutting it with a
knife<00:01:21.600> I've<00:01:22.600> been<00:01:22.720> cutting<00:01:22.930> it<00:01:23.080> with<00:01:23.140> a<00:01:23.200> knife

00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:31.479 
this feels so right now I guess our next

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:35.010 
this feels so right now I guess our next
step<00:01:31.869> is<00:01:32.020> to<00:01:32.200> hook<00:01:32.830> up<00:01:32.979> the<00:01:33.100> eye<00:01:33.130> on<00:01:33.930> there<00:01:34.930> it

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:35.020 
step is to hook up the eye on there it

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:37.920 
step is to hook up the eye on there it
is<00:01:35.080> and<00:01:35.290> then<00:01:35.950> put<00:01:36.220> a<00:01:36.400> piece<00:01:36.700> of<00:01:36.880> a<00:01:37.000> paper<00:01:37.720> bag
