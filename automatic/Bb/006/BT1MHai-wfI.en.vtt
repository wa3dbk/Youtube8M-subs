all<00:00:08.280> the<00:00:08.309> way<00:00:08.400> up<00:00:08.519> it's<00:00:08.670> still<00:00:08.910> not<00:00:09.090> easy<00:00:09.330> to

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540 
all the way up it's still not easy to

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:10.700 
all the way up it's still not easy to
get<00:00:09.630> to<00:00:09.690> these<00:00:09.870> bolts<00:00:10.290> you're<00:00:10.349> gonna<00:00:10.500> need<00:00:10.650> a

get to these bolts you're gonna need a

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.520 
get to these bolts you're gonna need a
long<00:00:10.980> wobble<00:00:11.639> extension<00:00:12.179> and<00:00:13.139> a<00:00:13.259> 10

long wobble extension and a 10
millimeter<00:00:13.889> socket<00:00:14.929> to<00:00:15.929> get<00:00:16.109> these<00:00:16.260> bolts<00:00:16.590> out

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:23.180 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:26.359 

you<00:00:24.180> see<00:00:24.420> you<00:00:25.109> see<00:00:25.350> why<00:00:25.560> they're<00:00:25.800> so<00:00:26.010> hidden

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
you see you see why they're so hidden

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.200 
you see you see why they're so hidden
and<00:00:26.849> this<00:00:27.539> once<00:00:28.260> again<00:00:28.439> is<00:00:28.859> typical<00:00:29.760> on<00:00:30.000> the

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
and this once again is typical on the

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:35.209 
and this once again is typical on the
190e<00:00:30.960> seats<00:00:32.180> the<00:00:33.180> 124<00:00:33.989> and<00:00:34.020> the<00:00:34.230> 126<00:00:35.040> rear

190e seats the 124 and the 126 rear
bolts<00:00:35.579> are<00:00:35.730> much<00:00:36.059> easier<00:00:36.090> to<00:00:36.600> get<00:00:36.840> to<00:00:37.050> now<00:00:37.920> that

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
bolts are much easier to get to now that

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.880 
bolts are much easier to get to now that
we<00:00:38.250> have<00:00:38.399> the<00:00:38.550> bolt<00:00:38.820> out<00:00:39.090> on<00:00:39.570> both<00:00:40.110> sides<00:00:40.440> we'll

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
we have the bolt out on both sides we'll

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.340 
we have the bolt out on both sides we'll
be<00:00:41.070> able<00:00:41.190> to<00:00:41.399> power<00:00:42.000> that<00:00:42.300> seat<00:00:42.690> back<00:00:42.989> to<00:00:43.230> get

be able to power that seat back to get
the<00:00:43.469> front<00:00:43.710> bolts<00:00:44.180> there's<00:00:45.180> one<00:00:45.539> very

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
the front bolts there's one very

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:47.479 
the front bolts there's one very
important<00:00:46.680> thing<00:00:46.710> I<00:00:46.920> forgot<00:00:47.100> to<00:00:47.280> mention

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
important thing I forgot to mention

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:50.420 
important thing I forgot to mention
earlier<00:00:48.300> and<00:00:48.690> that's<00:00:48.960> before<00:00:49.800> you<00:00:50.160> unplug

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
earlier and that's before you unplug

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.090 
earlier and that's before you unplug
these<00:00:51.000> electrical<00:00:51.570> plugs<00:00:51.899> here<00:00:52.170> make<00:00:53.070> sure

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
these electrical plugs here make sure

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.510 
these electrical plugs here make sure
that<00:00:53.760> you<00:00:54.210> power<00:00:55.110> the<00:00:55.289> headrest<00:00:55.920> all<00:00:56.219> the<00:00:56.399> way

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
that you power the headrest all the way

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.189 
that you power the headrest all the way
down<00:00:56.760> like<00:00:56.789> you<00:00:57.210> see<00:00:57.420> here<00:00:57.629> and<00:00:57.690> tip<00:00:58.050> it

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
down like you see here and tip it

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.500 
down like you see here and tip it
forward<00:00:58.230> if<00:00:59.070> you<00:00:59.579> can't<00:00:59.850> get<00:01:00.000> the<00:01:00.090> headrest

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
forward if you can't get the headrest

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.990 
forward if you can't get the headrest
down<00:01:00.750> it's<00:01:01.230> hard<00:01:01.500> to<00:01:02.129> get<00:01:02.280> it<00:01:02.399> to<00:01:02.430> the<00:01:02.730> door

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
down it's hard to get it to the door

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.910 
down it's hard to get it to the door
opening<00:01:03.390> okay<00:01:03.539> and<00:01:04.110> it<00:01:04.409> makes<00:01:04.619> it<00:01:04.769> a<00:01:04.799> lot

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
opening okay and it makes it a lot

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.190 
opening okay and it makes it a lot
easier<00:01:05.339> to<00:01:05.369> if<00:01:05.760> you<00:01:05.880> can<00:01:06.210> if<00:01:06.510> your<00:01:06.630> seat<00:01:06.930> back

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
easier to if you can if your seat back

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.770 
easier to if you can if your seat back
is<00:01:07.439> powering<00:01:07.920> tilting<00:01:08.909> back<00:01:09.150> and<00:01:09.420> forward

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
is powering tilting back and forward

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.200 
is powering tilting back and forward
also<00:01:10.290> power<00:01:10.920> the<00:01:11.220> seat<00:01:11.490> back<00:01:11.729> all<00:01:12.030> the<00:01:12.180> way

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
also power the seat back all the way

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.390 
also power the seat back all the way
forward<00:01:12.540> like<00:01:12.810> this<00:01:13.080> and<00:01:13.380> that'll<00:01:14.189> make<00:01:14.340> it

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
forward like this and that'll make it

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.340 
forward like this and that'll make it
easier<00:01:15.000> to<00:01:15.030> lift<00:01:15.360> the<00:01:15.509> seat<00:01:15.720> out<00:01:15.900> of<00:01:15.960> the<00:01:16.140> car

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
easier to lift the seat out of the car

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.160 
easier to lift the seat out of the car
then<00:01:17.100> unplug<00:01:17.400> the<00:01:17.610> wiring<00:01:17.939> okay<00:01:18.780> what<00:01:19.020> I'm

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
then unplug the wiring okay what I'm

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.749 
then unplug the wiring okay what I'm
doing<00:01:19.560> this<00:01:19.770> this<00:01:20.040> can<00:01:20.310> be<00:01:20.460> a<00:01:20.490> real

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
doing this this can be a real

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:21.969 
doing this this can be a real
backbreaker

00:01:21.969 --> 00:01:21.979 
backbreaker

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:24.170 
backbreaker
sometimes<00:01:22.979> I'll<00:01:23.189> actually<00:01:23.400> get<00:01:23.700> a<00:01:23.759> helper<00:01:24.119> if

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
sometimes I'll actually get a helper if

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.910 
sometimes I'll actually get a helper if
I<00:01:24.270> have<00:01:24.420> a<00:01:24.450> helper<00:01:24.720> handy<00:01:25.140> I'll<00:01:25.229> have<00:01:25.409> him<00:01:25.619> sit

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
I have a helper handy I'll have him sit

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.039 
I have a helper handy I'll have him sit
in<00:01:25.950> the<00:01:26.189> back<00:01:26.369> seat<00:01:26.400> to<00:01:27.330> give<00:01:27.540> me<00:01:27.780> a<00:01:27.810> little

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
in the back seat to give me a little

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.770 
in the back seat to give me a little
extra<00:01:28.350> oomph<00:01:28.799> in<00:01:29.310> the<00:01:29.850> back<00:01:30.060> of<00:01:30.299> the<00:01:30.390> seat<00:01:30.600> to

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
extra oomph in the back of the seat to

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.749 
extra oomph in the back of the seat to
get<00:01:30.960> it<00:01:31.079> up<00:01:31.170> and<00:01:31.350> out<00:01:31.439> of<00:01:31.590> the<00:01:31.680> car<00:01:31.890> because<00:01:32.520> if

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
get it up and out of the car because if

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.969 
get it up and out of the car because if
you<00:01:32.909> stand<00:01:33.240> up<00:01:33.540> and<00:01:33.840> try<00:01:34.020> to<00:01:34.079> reach<00:01:34.470> in<00:01:34.770> there

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
you stand up and try to reach in there

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:38.420 
you stand up and try to reach in there
and<00:01:35.040> lift<00:01:35.759> the<00:01:36.000> seat<00:01:36.240> out<00:01:36.290> you<00:01:37.290> you<00:01:38.009> can<00:01:38.220> really

and lift the seat out you you can really

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.550 
and lift the seat out you you can really
wrench<00:01:38.850> your<00:01:39.030> lower<00:01:39.240> back<00:01:39.509> so<00:01:39.840> if<00:01:40.049> I'm<00:01:40.200> by
