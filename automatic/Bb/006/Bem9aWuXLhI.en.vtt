00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:18.050
 as sparing with the each reported after 

00:00:15.889 --> 00:00:19.820
 whose inhabitants are loaded by boro 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:21.110
 I 'm crazy, I'm always like this 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:23.060
 a little bit crazy what the people 

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:27.340
 thinking that is permanently under drugs 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:29.420
 but good crazy yes i had relative 

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:32.809
 unusual life I have only 

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:36.320
 worked in the hotel pr agency 

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:37.879
 roof tile company attorney and then 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:39.230
 I was to get the radio then had 

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:41.420
 I still class so and so on 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:43.280
 then it suddenly happened to me somehow 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:46.089
 you already hear island book 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:49.250
 always wanted to write but did not have one 

00:00:46.089 --> 00:00:51.409
 no one came away quite badly in part 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:53.720
 and the fischer verlag was the last 

00:00:51.409 --> 00:00:56.930
 verlag where I have sent it 

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:59.000
 and thought that would not take now 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:01.220
 the trash 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.260
 and then the call came when can we 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:05.000
 us because of a contract 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.350
 composed it can not be 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.119
 I can do that, you must confuse me 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:11.090
 and I stimulate my copywriter as it 

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:13.520
 appeared was eating at the front kiss 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:14.750
 bestseller list on place 31 I think 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:18.159
 but something started 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:18.159
 I have only there it is good 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:25.500
 I am inspired by the very whole 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.570
 many things because it happens in 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:31.050
 basically always something funny 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.890
 or something dramatic or I'll take a look 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:34.080
 people simply 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.790
 I ask a subway call 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:36.840
 always one with the mobile phone I am sitting 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.270
 straight in the train 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.260
 I 'm sitting hello hello I'm sitting 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.720
 Everyone knows 

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:45.140
 I always write basically 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:49.620
 my desk quite unspectacular 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:52.950
 I sit then coffee then water and 

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:55.590
 I think I can partly find things 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:58.260
 but all that clichÃ© is the one 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.520
 Everyone knows that has ever happened and 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.840
 Everyone has been able to where he 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.250
 the money is not my day 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.610
 but then tomorrow is another one 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:07.920
 day corresponding broad mass because 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:11.220
 it is partly true even if it is 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:13.920
 Exaggerated is a piece down to earth 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:17.360
 I think that's one of them 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.360
 little where many recognize themselves again 

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:26.910
 my husband was the trigger after us 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:28.860
 came together two half lives 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:30.480
 we had to wait for each other 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:32.760
 and I liked that so much 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:34.770
 somehow thought I would have is the only way 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:36.540
 think about a story too 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:38.460
 it is a bit dramatic and so on 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:41.340
 then I have this postwar 

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:45.300
 war developed so postwar setting 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:46.800
 with max and sophie who are talking to each other 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:48.390
 to meet Romans and five each 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:51.210
 minutes to wait for the other 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:54.480
 Then the other one should come 

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:55.440
 Change your life as it ends now 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:57.720
 I will not tell 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:03.120
 it was just that my husband and 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:04.920
 I have a tremendous amount of support 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:07.050
 ultimately have to come together 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:10.320
 come and if I wanted so about it 

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:12.450
 Think about these two half lives 

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:14.490
 who have to wait in each other like 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:17.000
 be yourself it was worth it now 

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:18.470
 nine years ago 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.920
 and it is still as beautiful as on 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:20.920
 Beginning 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:27.860
 my favorite book buddenbrooks from 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:29.840
 thomas mann this writing style of 

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:32.360
 Thomas Mann brings it ready use 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:33.920
 to argue over about one side over 

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:34.520
 that would not be the case today 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:37.070
 go 

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:38.540
 but it fits in that moment it fits 

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:41.540
 I just fit in this book 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:43.370
 love to read brother sebastian fitzek 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:45.020
 or so I also like to read 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:47.330
 the books my authors colleague and 

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:49.220
 girlfriend but I like to read 

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:52.480
 really really something like that so honestly 

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:52.480
 a bit bloody 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:59.920
 a new roman is also known 

00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:01.180
 the book was published in june im 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:03.760
 fischer paperback verlag 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:04.959
 there are already many vampirromane me 

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:07.180
 I thought a little differently 

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:09.069
 and make a vampire comedy who mine 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:10.420
 knows books I know I'm always such a 

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:10.959
 needs little looking crazy 

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:13.060
 above 

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:13.959
 Of course that is not true me 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:16.000
 just have an overflowing 

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:17.680
 imagination if you read so firmly 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.680
 You should do it best if you have it 

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:25.120
 During the day, nice hot chocolate and 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:28.090
 drinking cream is already a 68er 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:30.210
 why is expensive but once you have to 

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:30.210
 do
