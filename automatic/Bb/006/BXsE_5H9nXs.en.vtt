00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
see Browns is ball hits soft on the rim

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:09.860 
see Browns is ball hits soft on the rim
so<00:03:07.770> even<00:03:08.010> if<00:03:08.130> it<00:03:08.280> hits<00:03:08.460> on<00:03:08.610> the<00:03:08.730> back<00:03:09.060> part<00:03:09.420> you

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 
still get that good roll and it knocks

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:13.370 
still get that good roll and it knocks
itself<00:03:11.910> in<00:03:12.150> you<00:03:12.540> know<00:03:12.600> the<00:03:12.690> majority<00:03:12.810> of<00:03:13.110> brown

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:13.380

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:15.270 
shots hit the back of the net so it's

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:17.420 
shots hit the back of the net so it's
not<00:03:15.420> even<00:03:15.600> a<00:03:15.780> concern<00:03:16.110> with<00:03:16.440> kind<00:03:16.980> of<00:03:17.070> the<00:03:17.160> spin

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 
not even a concern with kind of the spin

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:18.890 
not even a concern with kind of the spin
she's<00:03:17.700> getting<00:03:18.030> on<00:03:18.180> as<00:03:18.360> you<00:03:18.450> can<00:03:18.480> see<00:03:18.750> right

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:18.900 
she's getting on as you can see right

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:21.050 
she's getting on as you can see right
there<00:03:19.170> again<00:03:19.500> it<00:03:20.040> hits<00:03:20.340> the<00:03:20.490> back<00:03:20.670> of<00:03:20.820> the<00:03:20.880> net

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060 
there again it hits the back of the net

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:22.520 
there again it hits the back of the net
falls<00:03:21.330> right<00:03:21.660> through<00:03:21.720> and<00:03:22.110> then<00:03:22.200> we<00:03:22.290> get<00:03:22.410> the

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 
falls right through and then we get the

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:23.930 
falls right through and then we get the
