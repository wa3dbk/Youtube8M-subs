00:03:58.259 --> 00:03:58.269 
will start going a half back draw

00:03:58.269 --> 00:04:00.479 
will start going a half back draw
because<00:03:58.450> it's<00:03:58.750> gonna<00:03:58.870> look<00:03:59.139> like<00:03:59.200> a<00:03:59.379> past<00:03:59.739> but

00:04:00.479 --> 00:04:00.489 
because it's gonna look like a past but

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:02.399 
because it's gonna look like a past but
you're<00:04:01.060> actually<00:04:01.269> going<00:04:01.659> to<00:04:01.780> start<00:04:01.989> running

what<00:05:11.960> we're<00:05:12.139> going<00:05:12.290> to<00:05:12.530> do<00:05:12.740> is<00:05:13.010> we're<00:05:13.340> gonna

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:13.430 
what we're going to do is we're gonna

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:16.120 
what we're going to do is we're gonna
Zig<00:05:13.789> the<00:05:13.940> wide<00:05:14.120> receiver<00:05:14.570> and<00:05:14.960> he's<00:05:15.919> gonna

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:16.130 
Zig the wide receiver and he's gonna

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:18.490 
Zig the wide receiver and he's gonna
suck<00:05:16.400> in<00:05:16.550> any<00:05:16.760> zone<00:05:17.060> in<00:05:17.210> that<00:05:17.389> area<00:05:17.630> and<00:05:18.020> X<00:05:18.289> is

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:18.500 
suck in any zone in that area and X is

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:20.260 
suck in any zone in that area and X is
actually<00:05:18.919> gonna<00:05:19.070> come<00:05:19.340> right<00:05:19.610> over<00:05:19.669> the<00:05:20.060> top

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:20.270 
actually gonna come right over the top

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:22.779 
actually gonna come right over the top
and<00:05:20.630> he's<00:05:21.350> gonna<00:05:21.500> give<00:05:21.770> us<00:05:21.800> a<00:05:22.010> free<00:05:22.190> completion

00:05:22.779 --> 00:05:22.789 
and he's gonna give us a free completion

00:05:22.789 --> 00:05:25.510 
and he's gonna give us a free completion
so<00:05:22.970> take<00:05:23.539> a<00:05:23.570> walk<00:05:23.930> is<00:05:24.110> it<00:05:24.260> the<00:05:24.380> wire<00:05:24.560> receiver<00:05:24.949> X

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:25.520 
so take a walk is it the wire receiver X

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:27.219 
so take a walk is it the wire receiver X
is<00:05:25.639> gonna<00:05:25.789> come<00:05:26.000> over<00:05:26.210> the<00:05:26.300> top<00:05:26.360> and<00:05:26.870> you<00:05:27.020> shall

00:05:27.219 --> 00:05:27.229 
is gonna come over the top and you shall

00:05:27.229 --> 00:05:28.570 
is gonna come over the top and you shall
have<00:05:27.289> a<00:05:27.380> free<00:05:27.560> completion<00:05:28.160> this<00:05:28.310> will<00:05:28.460> be<00:05:28.550> a
