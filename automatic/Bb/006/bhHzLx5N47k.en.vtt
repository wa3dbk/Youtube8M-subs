00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:08.170
 changes to nasi a cali 

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:11.910
 iv and balancing items in this 

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:11.910
 episode of the previous update 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:22.570
 Hi evoking and welcome to the preview of 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:23.859
 This week's update 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:26.439
 changes coming in next update 

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:28.090
 from league of legends 

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:30.070
 although this video does not cover all 

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:31.779
 changes in the update we want to get 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:33.370
 a time to explain the process of 

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:34.230
 thinking behind some of the 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:37.360
 from them 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:39.190
 we started with our he will have concerts 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:42.210
 addition to some improvements in one 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:44.440
 cab go and your last sand bore 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.390
 recently discovered a problem with 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:48.640
 nasus in which the critical seats of 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:51.550
 his taxi with caused more damage than the 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:53.050
 desired while analyzing mazuz 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:55.000
 we also decided to review some 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:56.530
 Denasus core problems by improving 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.750
 some of your skills 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:00.550
 first course requires siphon attack 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:02.260
 will be the same at all levels in order to 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:02.860
 help players in their effectiveness in 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.140
 routes 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:07.149
 according to us, have many problems in 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:09.399
 time to chase after enemies on the run 

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:11.320
 we wanted to give him tools that still 

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:13.630
 allows without some kind of purchase move 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:15.789
 in the end we opted for fury of the areas as 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:17.590
 the best way to do that now in 

00:01:15.789 --> 00:01:19.479
 The streets are visually and strategically 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:21.490
 use health and here we have a bonus on 

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:23.380
 range of attack and range 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:24.909
 freezing in its ultimate form 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:27.340
 we also reduced the cost of maintenance 

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:29.320
 recharge of sands fury but the 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:31.719
 essential is its increased range in 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:33.310
 this change should help you wherever 

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:35.350
 it needs while making it seem more 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:36.100
 original from the point of view of the dynamics 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:38.140
 of game 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:40.060
 We arrived to Cali, which will have a change. 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:42.159
 of quality of life for its passive 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:44.229
 published twin subjects 

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:45.789
 The problem with twin subjects is that 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:47.590
 the players were forced to wsa 

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:49.689
 talents of specific accounts for 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:52.149
 meet the minimum basic requirements 

00:01:49.689 --> 00:01:54.340
 I think that's a bit restrictive. 

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:56.350
 then remove the minimum requirements for 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:57.520
 activation of save players already 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:00.009
 you should have a little more freedom 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:01.810
 in their streets and initial talents 

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:03.399
 specifically players since there 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:05.350
 can use their streets and talents 

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:07.420
 specific games for plays 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:09.759
 better depending on who they are 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:11.320
 Your enemies live is a champion of 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:13.510
 that can make a small 

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:15.160
 enormous advantage thanks to the quanta latina 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:15.770
 advantage of buying items from the 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:18.080
 attack 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:19.940
 at the beginning of the game but when 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:21.980
 left behind can be difficult 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:24.140
 achieve this curve, what will we do to 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:26.150
 give a make-up on this experience 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:29.060
 currently the only terrible thing that 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:30.890
 we will change it's unique passive blade in 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:33.440
 instead of climbing on a damage combination 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:35.390
 of bonus attack and the fixed of given blade 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:36.260
 single scale entirely from your plan 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:38.090
 of total attack 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.650
 this change should help players 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:41.660
 rugby comes from the two sons of the smart 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:43.160
 especially during its very phase 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:44.840
 important in the middle of the match 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:47.090
 it will remain strong and if it is 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:48.740
 but not overwhelmingly 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:50.720
 if she is behind her passive 

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:53.420
 will continue to strengthen at levels 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:54.950
 which will help to return to the starting one 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:56.780
 The extra advantage of this change is 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:58.670
 Easier transition from live to the end 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:00.050
 since its possible scale 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:02.710
 higher as it reaches the 

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:02.710
 complete composition 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:06.740
 we will help reduce recharge time 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:09.350
 for some items such as social protection 

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:10.520
 deep degree jatene herald of zac for 

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:12.620
 to name a few 

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:13.550
 but the objectives associated with this 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:15.350
 change 

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:17.360
 The essential point is that we wanted this 

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:19.220
 rebalancing of items was to differentiate 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:21.680
 best and 15 high and low 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:23.450
 load at the moment many popular items 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:25.400
 have some kind of recharge time 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:28.010
 embedded and players have maximized without 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:29.720
 statistics is always a lot with these 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:31.550
 changes are designed to encourage 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:33.020
 players were more bridges of their 

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:34.940
 Items compositions 

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:36.950
 if you want maximum time reduction of 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:38.209
 recharge you should run after it no 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:40.190
 I just fell on her 

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:42.170
 for example you did not buy suffocation 

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:43.750
 ig by reducing recharge you buy 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:45.740
 by the powerful active effect 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:48.050
 alternatively items such as degree 

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:50.120
 deep jatene or morelli contains large 

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:52.160
 synergy with high recharge reduction 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:54.410
 so we want to make that choice more 

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:55.670
 clear herald of zac spiritual countenance 

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:57.709
 we think these items were 

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:59.270
 conditional on how much you could or could not 

00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:01.790
 take advantage of its effects 

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:03.380
 then we want to make them 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:05.300
 items that greatly reduce the 

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:07.490
 recharge for these characters 

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:09.440
 now these items stand out among 

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:11.060
 other enhancements in the burning gem one of 

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:12.980
 our items the third season 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:15.140
 now you will also receive a 

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:16.370
 significant rework but were 

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:18.200
 our motivations 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:19.490
 initially the bank now 

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:21.410
 I am like an item from a niche to 

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:23.510
 aggressive tank style champions who 

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:25.490
 they loved diving into the towers 

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:27.590
 but instead of creating a diver 

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:29.720
 smart players bought more armed 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:31.490
 and life to face the towers with these 

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:32.960
 new changes we will place 

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:34.940
 diving loves like a buy 

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:36.910
 strategy for weaker champions 

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:39.110
 who still want to play aggressively 

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:40.910
 specifically multi-supporters 

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:42.610
 likes to buy a philosopher's stone in the 

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:45.440
 start of the game 

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:46.820
 This concludes this episode of 

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:47.540
 update preview the name of 

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:49.310
