hi<00:00:00.989> guys<00:00:01.260> i'm<00:00:01.650> back<00:00:01.680> with<00:00:02.070> the<00:00:02.250> new<00:00:02.429> piston

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:03.090 
hi guys i'm back with the new piston

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:06.970 
hi guys i'm back with the new piston
invention<00:00:03.629> so<00:00:03.929> here<00:00:04.740> is<00:00:04.770> the<00:00:05.420> elevator<00:00:06.420> SEO

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:06.980 
invention so here is the elevator SEO

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:16.760 
invention so here is the elevator SEO
saw<00:00:07.980> perhaps<00:00:08.429> my<00:00:08.820> previous<00:00:09.330> video<00:00:11.990> and<00:00:15.770> yeah

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
saw perhaps my previous video and yeah

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.029 
saw perhaps my previous video and yeah
and<00:00:16.890> this<00:00:17.039> is<00:00:17.070> the<00:00:17.250> new<00:00:17.400> invention<00:00:18.920> seems<00:00:19.920> to

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
and this is the new invention seems to

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:21.830 
and this is the new invention seems to
be<00:00:20.130> nothing<00:00:20.279> special<00:00:20.760> here<00:00:21.029> but<00:00:21.240> here's<00:00:21.750> a

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
be nothing special here but here's a

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.349 
be nothing special here but here's a
pool<00:00:22.170> and<00:00:22.560> so<00:00:23.369> if<00:00:23.519> you<00:00:23.550> activate<00:00:24.090> the<00:00:24.240> switch

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
pool and so if you activate the switch

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:29.359 
pool and so if you activate the switch
there<00:00:25.140> is<00:00:25.760> yeah<00:00:26.760> more<00:00:27.119> small<00:00:27.449> pool<00:00:27.720> but<00:00:28.369> it's

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
there is yeah more small pool but it's

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.740 
there is yeah more small pool but it's
not<00:00:29.640> the<00:00:29.840> really<00:00:30.840> interesting<00:00:31.109> thing<00:00:32.750> that's

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
not the really interesting thing that's

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.910 
not the really interesting thing that's
this<00:00:34.110> actually<00:00:34.770> nothing<00:00:35.250> if<00:00:35.670> the<00:00:36.000> pool<00:00:36.690> is

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:36.920 
this actually nothing if the pool is

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:40.790 
this actually nothing if the pool is
hidden<00:00:37.920> but<00:00:38.640> if<00:00:38.940> I<00:00:39.059> am<00:00:39.420> open<00:00:40.290> the<00:00:40.350> pool<00:00:40.530> and

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
hidden but if I am open the pool and

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.069 
hidden but if I am open the pool and
then<00:00:41.070> push<00:00:41.640> the<00:00:41.670> bottom<00:00:42.030> its<00:00:42.690> flood<00:00:43.730> yeah<00:00:44.730> and

00:00:45.069 --> 00:00:45.079 
then push the bottom its flood yeah and

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:49.760 
then push the bottom its flood yeah and
you<00:00:46.079> can<00:00:46.260> also<00:00:47.030> dry<00:00:48.030> it<00:00:48.090> if<00:00:48.570> you<00:00:48.809> just<00:00:49.230> push

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
you can also dry it if you just push

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.240 
you can also dry it if you just push
this<00:00:49.920> button<00:00:50.100> it<00:00:50.399> a<00:00:50.579> lever<00:00:51.390> and<00:00:51.629> stand<00:00:52.250> again

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
this button it a lever and stand again

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.600 
this button it a lever and stand again
yeah<00:00:54.149> and<00:00:54.360> it's<00:00:55.199> if<00:00:55.680> I<00:00:55.980> don't<00:00:56.280> know<00:00:56.370> if<00:00:56.489> you

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
yeah and it's if I don't know if you

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.790 
yeah and it's if I don't know if you
could<00:00:56.789> make<00:00:57.149> it<00:00:57.329> deeper<00:00:58.140> it's<00:00:58.350> a<00:00:58.620> bit

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
could make it deeper it's a bit

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.630 
could make it deeper it's a bit
difficult<00:00:59.160> costs<00:00:59.699> sticky<00:01:00.539> pistons<00:01:00.989> I<00:01:01.640> can

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
difficult costs sticky pistons I can

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.060 
difficult costs sticky pistons I can
pull<00:01:02.879> sticky<00:01:03.180> business<00:01:03.390> but<00:01:03.750> stay<00:01:04.019> can<00:01:04.379> not

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
pull sticky business but stay can not

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.730 
pull sticky business but stay can not
pull<00:01:05.430> sticky<00:01:05.820> pistons<00:01:06.240> which<00:01:06.420> also<00:01:07.140> helps

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
pull sticky pistons which also helps

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.070 
pull sticky pistons which also helps
block<00:01:08.220> in<00:01:08.400> front<00:01:08.430> of<00:01:08.729> them<00:01:08.850> or<00:01:09.090> even<00:01:09.689> a

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
block in front of them or even a

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.590 
block in front of them or even a
third-degree<00:01:10.860> pistons<00:01:11.280> it's<00:01:11.400> a<00:01:11.549> bit<00:01:11.670> buggy<00:01:11.880> um

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
third-degree pistons it's a bit buggy um

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.780 
third-degree pistons it's a bit buggy um
so<00:01:13.590> it's<00:01:13.770> a<00:01:13.890> bit<00:01:14.070> difficult<00:01:14.220> to<00:01:14.490> make<00:01:14.640> its

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
so it's a bit difficult to make its

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:20.480 
so it's a bit difficult to make its
deeper<00:01:15.740> yeah<00:01:16.740> but<00:01:17.040> it's<00:01:17.479> cool<00:01:18.479> I<00:01:18.509> think<00:01:19.490> yeah

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
deeper yeah but it's cool I think yeah

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.179 
deeper yeah but it's cool I think yeah
thanks<00:01:20.880> for<00:01:21.000> watching<00:01:21.299> and<00:01:21.479> a<00:01:21.720> or<00:01:22.170> perhaps<00:01:22.920> you

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
thanks for watching and a or perhaps you

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:26.410 
thanks for watching and a or perhaps you
want<00:01:23.220> to<00:01:23.430> know<00:01:23.610> how<00:01:23.820> this<00:01:23.939> works<00:01:24.210> I<00:01:24.540> don't<00:01:24.990> know

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:26.420 
want to know how this works I don't know

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:30.620 
want to know how this works I don't know
is<00:01:27.420> the<00:01:27.630> entrance<00:01:28.520> and<00:01:29.520> it's<00:01:30.090> actually<00:01:30.240> quite

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
is the entrance and it's actually quite

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:35.170 
is the entrance and it's actually quite
close<00:01:30.900> to<00:01:31.229> the<00:01:31.320> wiring<00:01:31.740> from<00:01:32.220> the<00:01:34.070> elevator

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:35.180 
close to the wiring from the elevator

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:38.810 
close to the wiring from the elevator
it's<00:01:36.180> this<00:01:36.750> thing<00:01:37.140> you<00:01:37.200> and<00:01:37.590> here's<00:01:38.460> our

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
it's this thing you and here's our

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.330 
it's this thing you and here's our
wiring<00:01:39.390> it's<00:01:39.689> a<00:01:39.780> bit<00:01:39.930> to<00:01:40.079> view<00:01:40.200> I<00:01:40.409> hate<00:01:41.220> this

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
wiring it's a bit to view I hate this

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.700 
wiring it's a bit to view I hate this
glitch<00:01:41.670> if<00:01:41.939> you<00:01:42.090> walk<00:01:42.420> on<00:01:42.720> the<00:01:42.960> edge<00:01:43.200> of

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
glitch if you walk on the edge of

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.950 
glitch if you walk on the edge of
redstone<00:01:44.670> repeater<00:01:45.119> you<00:01:45.299> sometimes<00:01:45.750> get

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
redstone repeater you sometimes get

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.260 
redstone repeater you sometimes get
stuck<00:01:46.229> a<00:01:46.259> block<00:01:46.619> below<00:01:46.770> and<00:01:47.720> don't<00:01:48.720> know<00:01:48.869> why

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:50.270 
stuck a block below and don't know why

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:53.200 
stuck a block below and don't know why
yeah<00:01:51.270> so<00:01:51.960> it<00:01:52.140> was<00:01:52.350> a<00:01:52.380> bit<00:01:52.560> difficult<00:01:52.590> to

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:53.210 
yeah so it was a bit difficult to

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:56.990 
yeah so it was a bit difficult to
connect<00:01:54.210> all<00:01:54.360> the<00:01:54.689> Pistons<00:01:55.649> here<00:01:56.000> it

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
connect all the Pistons here it

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.330 
connect all the Pistons here it
basically<00:01:57.270> works<00:01:57.840> this<00:01:58.020> a<00:01:58.380> here<00:01:58.979> are<00:01:59.130> these

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
basically works this a here are these

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.139 
basically works this a here are these
repeaters<00:01:59.790> they<00:02:00.619> power<00:02:01.619> this<00:02:02.219> redstone

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
repeaters they power this redstone

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:07.990 
repeaters they power this redstone
torches<00:02:03.659> and<00:02:03.930> the<00:02:04.710> Pistons<00:02:04.920> above<00:02:05.460> here<00:02:05.790> and

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:08.000 
torches and the Pistons above here and

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.850 
torches and the Pistons above here and
the<00:02:09.000> same<00:02:09.239> goes<00:02:09.300> on<00:02:09.629> the<00:02:09.720> other<00:02:09.840> side<00:02:10.110> and<00:02:12.080> it

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
the same goes on the other side and it

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:18.710 
the same goes on the other side and it
more<00:02:14.130> difficult<00:02:15.020> these<00:02:17.270> redstone<00:02:18.270> repeaters

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
more difficult these redstone repeaters

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:24.040 
more difficult these redstone repeaters
here<00:02:19.430> here<00:02:20.430> ends<00:02:20.850> on<00:02:21.060> the<00:02:21.210> other<00:02:21.330> side<00:02:21.600> too

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:24.050 
here here ends on the other side too

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:30.070 
here here ends on the other side too
Howard<00:02:25.050> this<00:02:25.290> block<00:02:26.570> again<00:02:27.570> track<00:02:28.050> English

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:30.080 
Howard this block again track English

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:36.830 
Howard this block again track English
yeah<00:02:31.080> and<00:02:31.260> which<00:02:31.470> powers<00:02:31.920> this<00:02:32.370> one<00:02:32.760> and<00:02:35.840> this

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
yeah and which powers this one and this

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:40.699 
yeah and which powers this one and this
torch<00:02:37.200> and<00:02:37.500> this<00:02:38.460> powers<00:02:39.020> yeah<00:02:40.020> this<00:02:40.320> piston

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:40.709 
torch and this powers yeah this piston

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:44.330 
torch and this powers yeah this piston
and<00:02:40.860> this<00:02:41.850> is<00:02:42.000> for<00:02:42.330> the<00:02:42.360> other<00:02:42.690> three<00:02:43.500> recently

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
and this is for the other three recently

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:47.900 
and this is for the other three recently
it's<00:02:44.520> the<00:02:44.640> same<00:02:44.850> and<00:02:45.080> the<00:02:46.080> two<00:02:46.650> pieces<00:02:46.860> on<00:02:47.220> here

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
it's the same and the two pieces on here

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:51.370 
it's the same and the two pieces on here
are<00:02:48.180> directly<00:02:48.990> powered<00:02:49.550> through<00:02:50.550> the<00:02:50.820> block

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:51.380 
are directly powered through the block

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:57.190 
are directly powered through the block
through<00:02:52.380> this<00:02:52.560> blog<00:02:52.770> at<00:02:52.980> this<00:02:53.400> repeater<00:02:53.850> so

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:57.200 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:02.680 

it's<00:02:58.200> um<00:02:58.470> I<00:02:58.770> have<00:02:59.220> to<00:02:59.489> clean<00:02:59.700> up<00:02:59.730> my<00:02:59.850> inventory

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:02.690 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:17.390 

hey<00:03:14.720> so<00:03:15.720> and<00:03:15.959> this<00:03:16.500> block<00:03:16.800> this<00:03:17.160> block<00:03:17.310> is

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
hey so and this block this block is

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:20.509 
hey so and this block this block is
power<00:03:17.730> then<00:03:18.500> through<00:03:19.500> this<00:03:19.709> this<00:03:20.010> redstone

00:03:20.509 --> 00:03:20.519 
power then through this this redstone

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:24.229 
power then through this this redstone
torches<00:03:21.510> part<00:03:21.870> and<00:03:22.170> then<00:03:22.290> this<00:03:22.799> blog<00:03:23.100> and<00:03:23.250> then

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:24.239 
torches part and then this blog and then

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:27.710 
torches part and then this blog and then
this<00:03:24.840> redstone<00:03:25.260> repeater<00:03:25.709> yes<00:03:26.510> seems<00:03:27.510> to<00:03:27.690> work

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.720 
this redstone repeater yes seems to work

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:34.009 
this redstone repeater yes seems to work
well<00:03:27.870> and<00:03:28.320> the<00:03:29.220> other<00:03:29.370> thing<00:03:30.000> is<00:03:32.930> difficult<00:03:33.930> to

00:03:34.009 --> 00:03:34.019 
well and the other thing is difficult to

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:37.610 
well and the other thing is difficult to
see<00:03:34.170> it<00:03:34.230> it's<00:03:34.410> the<00:03:35.160> repeaters<00:03:35.670> a<00:03:35.989> the<00:03:36.989> Pistons

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:37.620 
see it it's the repeaters a the Pistons

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:40.940 
see it it's the repeaters a the Pistons
here<00:03:37.920> are<00:03:38.720> the<00:03:39.720> Pistons<00:03:40.110> which<00:03:40.290> hides<00:03:40.620> the

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:40.950 
here are the Pistons which hides the

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:51.259 
here are the Pistons which hides the
water<00:03:41.430> sources<00:03:42.980> behind<00:03:44.390> the<00:03:45.890> wall<00:03:49.970> you<00:03:50.970> may

00:03:51.259 --> 00:03:51.269 
water sources behind the wall you may

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:58.850 
water sources behind the wall you may
have<00:03:51.420> noticed<00:03:51.840> them<00:03:52.049> already<00:03:56.390> yes<00:03:57.390> all<00:03:57.860> water

00:03:58.850 --> 00:03:58.860 
have noticed them already yes all water

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:05.150 
have noticed them already yes all water
below<00:03:59.340> to<00:03:59.400> see<00:03:59.730> and<00:04:00.980> if<00:04:01.980> i<00:04:03.739> push<00:04:04.739> the<00:04:04.890> button

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:05.160 
below to see and if i push the button

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:08.390 
below to see and if i push the button
the<00:04:05.370> lever<00:04:06.120> is<00:04:06.390> opened<00:04:06.930> for<00:04:07.049> a<00:04:07.530> short<00:04:07.920> time<00:04:08.130> and

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:08.400 
the lever is opened for a short time and

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:11.650 
the lever is opened for a short time and
now<00:04:09.209> the<00:04:09.269> proof<00:04:09.840> and<00:04:10.049> flat<00:04:10.260> and<00:04:10.290> because

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:11.660 
now the proof and flat and because

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:18.409 
now the proof and flat and because
they're<00:04:12.660> a<00:04:13.650> water<00:04:14.100> source<00:04:15.799> I<00:04:16.799> am<00:04:17.459> water<00:04:18.060> became

sand water source if to eject water

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:23.740 
sand water source if to eject water
sources<00:04:20.669> are<00:04:21.030> there<00:04:21.600> and<00:04:21.959> the<00:04:22.590> hoop<00:04:22.800> who<00:04:23.070> it's

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:23.750 
sources are there and the hoop who it's

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:27.500 
sources are there and the hoop who it's
multi<00:04:24.750> service<00:04:25.160> at<00:04:26.160> first<00:04:26.430> this<00:04:26.640> blocked<00:04:26.970> and

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:27.510 
multi service at first this blocked and

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:29.630 
multi service at first this blocked and
honest<00:04:27.810> you<00:04:27.960> can<00:04:28.170> see<00:04:28.410> it's<00:04:28.560> em<00:04:28.800> if<00:04:29.280> you<00:04:29.400> could

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:29.640 
honest you can see it's em if you could

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:34.430 
honest you can see it's em if you could
and<00:04:30.860> watch<00:04:31.860> how<00:04:32.100> it's<00:04:32.280> flooded<00:04:32.750> it's<00:04:33.750> the

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:34.440 
and watch how it's flooded it's the

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:36.500 
and watch how it's flooded it's the
water<00:04:34.620> still<00:04:34.890> to<00:04:35.070> start<00:04:35.310> from<00:04:35.490> here<00:04:35.700> and<00:04:35.820> go<00:04:35.880> to

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:36.510 
water still to start from here and go to

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:46.010 
water still to start from here and go to
this<00:04:36.660> side<00:04:40.400> yeah<00:04:44.420> perhaps<00:04:45.420> you<00:04:45.570> want<00:04:45.720> to<00:04:45.750> oh<00:04:45.840> hi

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:46.020 
this side yeah perhaps you want to oh hi

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:48.370 
this side yeah perhaps you want to oh hi
how<00:04:46.590> I<00:04:46.620> connected<00:04:47.190> to<00:04:47.310> the<00:04:47.430> button<00:04:47.700> to<00:04:47.940> the

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:48.380 
how I connected to the button to the

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:52.510 
how I connected to the button to the
ground<00:04:49.380> without<00:04:49.760> any<00:04:50.760> objective<00:04:51.510> block<00:04:51.720> to<00:04:51.870> it

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:52.520 
ground without any objective block to it

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:55.430 
ground without any objective block to it
it's<00:04:53.520> possible<00:04:54.210> but<00:04:54.270> a<00:04:54.630> bit<00:04:54.960> difficult<00:04:55.170> to

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:55.440 
it's possible but a bit difficult to

00:04:55.440 --> 00:05:03.200 
it's possible but a bit difficult to
strider<00:04:56.250> to<00:04:56.640> signal<00:04:56.970> down<00:04:59.180> and<00:05:00.590> just<00:05:02.180> make<00:05:03.180> a

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:03.210 
strider to signal down and just make a

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:08.210 
strider to signal down and just make a
redstone<00:05:04.520> wire<00:05:05.520> below<00:05:06.030> and<00:05:06.380> power<00:05:07.380> and<00:05:07.740> hence

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:08.220 
redstone wire below and power and hence

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:13.220 
redstone wire below and power and hence
a<00:05:08.580> redstone<00:05:09.030> repeater<00:05:10.040> decide<00:05:11.040> this<00:05:11.420> yes<00:05:12.420> it

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:13.230 
a redstone repeater decide this yes it

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:15.320 
a redstone repeater decide this yes it
gets<00:05:13.440> powered<00:05:13.860> and<00:05:14.100> this<00:05:14.550> redstone<00:05:14.970> repeater

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:15.330 
gets powered and this redstone repeater

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:20.920 
gets powered and this redstone repeater
past<00:05:15.600> is<00:05:15.810> that<00:05:16.410> block<00:05:16.650> and<00:05:18.230> then<00:05:19.230> these<00:05:19.740> two

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:20.930 
past is that block and then these two

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:23.680 
past is that block and then these two
repeaters<00:05:21.930> and<00:05:22.140> this<00:05:22.470> one<00:05:22.710> directly<00:05:23.160> that's

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:23.690 
repeaters and this one directly that's

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:26.480 
repeaters and this one directly that's
echo<00:05:24.690> I<00:05:24.840> made<00:05:25.020> this<00:05:25.140> cause<00:05:25.440> if<00:05:25.680> I<00:05:25.860> just<00:05:26.190> push

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:26.490 
echo I made this cause if I just push

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:31.040 
echo I made this cause if I just push
the<00:05:26.730> button<00:05:26.760> and<00:05:28.850> the<00:05:29.850> signal<00:05:30.420> is<00:05:30.630> too<00:05:30.840> short

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:31.050 
the button and the signal is too short

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:33.080 
the button and the signal is too short
and<00:05:31.350> the<00:05:31.560> pool<00:05:31.740> won't<00:05:31.980> be<00:05:32.220> flooded<00:05:32.610> completely

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:33.090 
and the pool won't be flooded completely

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:37.730 
and the pool won't be flooded completely
I<00:05:34.190> had<00:05:35.190> to<00:05:35.340> do<00:05:35.460> and<00:05:35.700> make<00:05:36.660> it<00:05:36.780> longer<00:05:36.960> so<00:05:37.260> that's

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:37.740 
I had to do and make it longer so that's

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:41.150 
I had to do and make it longer so that's
the<00:05:38.070> hoop<00:05:38.370> who<00:05:38.550> is<00:05:38.670> flooded<00:05:39.380> yeah<00:05:40.380> and<00:05:40.560> here<00:05:40.920> it

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:41.160 
the hoop who is flooded yeah and here it

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:42.830 
the hoop who is flooded yeah and here it
goes<00:05:41.370> down<00:05:41.400> to<00:05:41.670> this<00:05:41.910> redstone<00:05:42.300> torch<00:05:42.660> and

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:42.840 
goes down to this redstone torch and

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:45.020 
goes down to this redstone torch and
then<00:05:42.960> it<00:05:43.080> powers<00:05:43.440> the<00:05:43.470> red<00:05:44.340> stone<00:05:44.580> at<00:05:44.850> the

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:45.030 
then it powers the red stone at the

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:47.780 
then it powers the red stone at the
sides<00:05:45.330> and<00:05:45.680> the<00:05:46.680> pit<00:05:46.890> in<00:05:47.040> the<00:05:47.070> sticky<00:05:47.400> pistons

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:47.790 
sides and the pit in the sticky pistons

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:51.860 
sides and the pit in the sticky pistons
and<00:05:47.940> of<00:05:48.270> course<00:05:48.510> I<00:05:49.220> to<00:05:50.220> make<00:05:50.670> it<00:05:50.850> clean<00:05:51.540> of<00:05:51.690> you

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:51.870 
and of course I to make it clean of you

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:56.690 
and of course I to make it clean of you
I<00:05:52.080> did<00:05:52.800> not<00:05:53.010> directly<00:05:53.640> make<00:05:53.970> em<00:05:55.580> set<00:05:56.580> the

00:05:56.690 --> 00:05:56.700 
I did not directly make em set the

00:05:56.700 --> 00:06:00.050 
I did not directly make em set the
Pistons<00:05:57.060> here<00:05:57.210> but<00:05:57.420> always<00:05:58.820> wouldn't<00:05:59.820> Clank

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:00.060 
Pistons here but always wouldn't Clank

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:02.030 
Pistons here but always wouldn't Clank
above<00:06:00.360> and<00:06:00.660> stick<00:06:01.110> this<00:06:01.290> and<00:06:01.500> stress<00:06:01.710> pulls
