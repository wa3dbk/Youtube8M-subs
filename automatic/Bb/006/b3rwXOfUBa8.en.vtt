what do you want them to do it's really

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.290

important<00:01:13.470> that<00:01:13.560> you're<00:01:13.979> extremely<00:01:14.700> clear

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:15.300 
important that you're extremely clear

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:18.530 
important that you're extremely clear
about<00:01:15.600> that<00:01:15.900> often<00:01:16.490> people<00:01:17.490> aren't<00:01:18.270> and<00:01:18.450> it

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
about that often people aren't and it

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.730
