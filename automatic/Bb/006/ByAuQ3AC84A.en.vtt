hello and welcome to indigo studios in
this<00:00:05.810> video<00:00:06.230> we<00:00:06.680> are<00:00:06.710> going<00:00:06.830> to<00:00:07.250> talk<00:00:07.430> about

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:07.640 
this video we are going to talk about

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:10.090 
this video we are going to talk about
storyboarding<00:00:08.540> and<00:00:08.660> this<00:00:09.350> is<00:00:09.560> going<00:00:09.830> to<00:00:09.980> be

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:10.100 
storyboarding and this is going to be

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:12.150 
storyboarding and this is going to be
part<00:00:10.430> one<00:00:10.640> of<00:00:10.880> a<00:00:11.090> six-part<00:00:11.630> series

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:12.160 
part one of a six-part series

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:14.620 
part one of a six-part series
introducing<00:00:13.160> the<00:00:13.190> key<00:00:13.460> features<00:00:13.940> of<00:00:13.970> indigo

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:14.630 
introducing the key features of indigo

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:17.290 
introducing the key features of indigo
now<00:00:15.559> it<00:00:15.860> may<00:00:16.099> be<00:00:16.129> common<00:00:16.550> knowledge<00:00:16.730> but

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:17.300 
now it may be common knowledge but

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:19.749 
now it may be common knowledge but
planning<00:00:18.140> a<00:00:18.199> little<00:00:18.289> before<00:00:18.769> prototyping<00:00:19.519> can

00:00:19.749 --> 00:00:19.759 
planning a little before prototyping can

00:00:19.759 --> 00:00:22.509 
planning a little before prototyping can
save<00:00:20.060> a<00:00:20.089> lot<00:00:20.480> of<00:00:20.539> trouble<00:00:21.489> basing<00:00:22.489> your

00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:22.519 
save a lot of trouble basing your

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:24.640 
save a lot of trouble basing your
prototypes<00:00:23.179> on<00:00:23.390> user<00:00:23.599> stories<00:00:24.109> will<00:00:24.319> keep<00:00:24.499> it

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:24.650 
prototypes on user stories will keep it

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:27.040 
prototypes on user stories will keep it
focused<00:00:24.829> I<00:00:25.339> suppose<00:00:26.179> another<00:00:26.509> way<00:00:26.749> to<00:00:26.810> say

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:27.050 
focused I suppose another way to say

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:28.989 
focused I suppose another way to say
this<00:00:27.079> is<00:00:27.529> that<00:00:27.710> you<00:00:27.859> don't<00:00:28.130> need<00:00:28.310> to<00:00:28.489> prototype

00:00:28.989 --> 00:00:28.999 
this is that you don't need to prototype

00:00:28.999 --> 00:00:32.109 
this is that you don't need to prototype
everything<00:00:29.599> in<00:00:29.810> this<00:00:30.560> demo<00:00:31.069> we<00:00:31.550> are<00:00:31.669> going<00:00:31.970> to

everything in this demo we are going to

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:34.240 
everything in this demo we are going to
design<00:00:32.419> a<00:00:32.480> car<00:00:32.840> maintenance<00:00:33.109> app<00:00:33.559> and<00:00:33.800> the

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:34.250 
design a car maintenance app and the

story<00:00:34.579> we<00:00:34.789> are<00:00:34.879> designing<00:00:35.239> for<00:00:35.570> is<00:00:35.809> a<00:00:35.930> flat

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:36.230 
story we are designing for is a flat

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:39.099 
story we are designing for is a flat
tire<00:00:36.559> story<00:00:37.039> it<00:00:37.340> involves<00:00:38.030> a<00:00:38.300> person<00:00:38.719> getting

a<00:00:39.230> flat<00:00:39.469> tire<00:00:39.769> and<00:00:40.070> then<00:00:40.429> using<00:00:40.820> the<00:00:40.940> app<00:00:41.090> to

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:41.120 
a flat tire and then using the app to

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:43.959 
a flat tire and then using the app to
actually<00:00:41.539> get<00:00:42.019> it<00:00:42.140> fixed<00:00:42.590> we<00:00:43.429> can<00:00:43.640> all<00:00:43.820> agree

00:00:43.959 --> 00:00:43.969 
actually get it fixed we can all agree

that pen and paper are indispensable
tools<00:00:46.820> for<00:00:47.210> planning<00:00:47.239> I<00:00:47.780> want<00:00:48.620> to<00:00:48.710> show<00:00:49.010> how

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:49.460 
tools for planning I want to show how

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:51.849 
tools for planning I want to show how
indigo<00:00:50.030> can<00:00:50.269> pick<00:00:50.480> up<00:00:50.660> where<00:00:51.170> you<00:00:51.230> left<00:00:51.379> off<00:00:51.800> in

00:00:51.849 --> 00:00:51.859 
indigo can pick up where you left off in

00:00:51.859 --> 00:00:55.299 
indigo can pick up where you left off in
your<00:00:52.219> sketchbook<00:00:52.820> or<00:00:52.999> whiteboard<00:00:54.070> so<00:00:55.070> let's

00:00:55.299 --> 00:00:55.309 
your sketchbook or whiteboard so let's

00:00:55.309 --> 00:00:59.619 
your sketchbook or whiteboard so let's
get<00:00:55.489> started<00:00:56.800> so<00:00:57.800> to<00:00:57.859> get<00:00:58.370> started<00:00:58.429> I<00:00:59.089> went

00:00:59.619 --> 00:00:59.629 
get started so to get started I went

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:01.779 
get started so to get started I went
ahead<00:00:59.719> and<00:00:59.929> digitized<00:01:00.679> my<00:01:01.010> sketches<00:01:01.550> I'm

00:01:01.779 --> 00:01:01.789 
ahead and digitized my sketches I'm

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:04.470 
ahead and digitized my sketches I'm
going<00:01:02.690> to<00:01:02.809> create<00:01:03.079> a<00:01:03.140> storyboard<00:01:03.559> using<00:01:04.190> these

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:04.480 
going to create a storyboard using these

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:07.510 
going to create a storyboard using these
so<00:01:05.480> creating<00:01:05.930> a<00:01:05.990> storyboard<00:01:06.530> take<00:01:07.160> some<00:01:07.400> of

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:07.520 
so creating a storyboard take some of

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:11.830 
so creating a storyboard take some of
the<00:01:07.610> sketches<00:01:08.060> and<00:01:08.210> drag<00:01:08.600> them<00:01:08.780> in<00:01:10.450> so<00:01:11.450> once<00:01:11.660> I

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:11.840 
the sketches and drag them in so once I

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:14.020 
the sketches and drag them in so once I
have<00:01:12.080> them<00:01:12.230> in<00:01:12.290> my<00:01:12.530> storyboard<00:01:13.160> I'm<00:01:13.340> going<00:01:13.850> to

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:14.030 
have them in my storyboard I'm going to

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:19.480 
have them in my storyboard I'm going to
go<00:01:14.180> ahead<00:01:14.210> and<00:01:14.750> lay<00:01:15.020> these<00:01:15.260> out<00:01:15.500> I<00:01:18.340> can<00:01:19.340> also

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:19.490 
go ahead and lay these out I can also

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:21.730 
go ahead and lay these out I can also
connect<00:01:20.060> the<00:01:20.210> steps<00:01:20.510> by<00:01:20.870> just<00:01:21.140> dragging<00:01:21.410> the

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:21.740 
connect the steps by just dragging the

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:27.040 
connect the steps by just dragging the
arrow<00:01:25.300> now<00:01:26.300> I'm<00:01:26.510> going<00:01:26.780> to<00:01:26.870> add<00:01:27.020> some

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:27.050 
arrow now I'm going to add some

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:30.610 
arrow now I'm going to add some
descriptions<00:01:28.630> you<00:01:29.630> can<00:01:29.810> also<00:01:29.990> add<00:01:30.320> more

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:30.620 
descriptions you can also add more

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:35.080 
descriptions you can also add more
detail<00:01:30.830> if<00:01:31.310> you<00:01:31.460> like<00:01:31.670> I<00:01:33.280> can<00:01:34.280> just<00:01:34.460> go<00:01:34.790> to<00:01:34.850> the

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:35.090 
detail if you like I can just go to the

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:37.840 
detail if you like I can just go to the
next<00:01:35.240> screen<00:01:35.510> and<00:01:35.900> I<00:01:36.080> can<00:01:36.260> say<00:01:36.530> the<00:01:37.280> app<00:01:37.460> shows

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:37.850 
next screen and I can say the app shows

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:42.490 
next screen and I can say the app shows
an<00:01:38.120> alert<00:01:40.540> so<00:01:41.540> I<00:01:41.570> went<00:01:41.870> ahead<00:01:42.050> and<00:01:42.380> added

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:42.500 
an alert so I went ahead and added

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.070 
an alert so I went ahead and added
descriptions<00:01:43.250> to<00:01:43.460> the<00:01:43.550> images<00:01:43.970> what<00:01:44.690> I<00:01:44.720> really

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:45.080 
descriptions to the images what I really

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:46.570 
descriptions to the images what I really
wanted<00:01:45.320> to<00:01:45.380> highlight<00:01:45.680> is<00:01:46.040> that<00:01:46.100> in

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:46.580 
wanted to highlight is that in

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:48.520 
wanted to highlight is that in
traditional<00:01:47.090> tools<00:01:47.300> it's<00:01:47.660> difficult<00:01:47.930> to<00:01:48.380> show

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:48.530 
traditional tools it's difficult to show

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:50.830 
traditional tools it's difficult to show
this<00:01:48.740> interplay<00:01:49.340> between<00:01:49.580> the<00:01:50.180> users<00:01:50.540> story

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:50.840 
this interplay between the users story

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:53.200 
this interplay between the users story
and<00:01:51.110> the<00:01:51.260> app<00:01:51.410> story<00:01:51.800> showing<00:01:52.580> this<00:01:52.790> helps<00:01:53.120> you

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:53.210 
and the app story showing this helps you

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:55.210 
and the app story showing this helps you
get<00:01:53.330> a<00:01:53.390> sense<00:01:53.660> of<00:01:53.930> how<00:01:54.110> much<00:01:54.290> to<00:01:54.470> prototype<00:01:54.980> and

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:55.220 
get a sense of how much to prototype and

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:57.430 
get a sense of how much to prototype and
with<00:01:55.760> indigo<00:01:56.180> storyboards<00:01:56.840> what<00:01:57.290> I've<00:01:57.410> shown

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:57.440 
with indigo storyboards what I've shown

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:00.220 
with indigo storyboards what I've shown
you<00:01:57.710> is<00:01:58.040> that<00:01:58.160> you<00:01:58.340> can<00:01:58.550> do<00:01:58.700> exactly<00:01:59.120> that<00:01:59.330> now

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:00.230 
you is that you can do exactly that now

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:01.810 
you is that you can do exactly that now
to<00:02:00.290> further<00:02:00.680> accentuate<00:02:01.100> the<00:02:01.430> fact<00:02:01.670> that

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:01.820 
to further accentuate the fact that

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:03.490 
to further accentuate the fact that
these<00:02:02.030> are<00:02:02.210> app<00:02:02.360> screens<00:02:02.750> and<00:02:02.990> that<00:02:03.110> those<00:02:03.320> are

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:03.500 
these are app screens and that those are

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:05.590 
these are app screens and that those are
actually<00:02:03.860> contact<00:02:04.340> stories<00:02:04.730> I'm<00:02:04.910> going<00:02:05.510> to

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:05.600 
actually contact stories I'm going to

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:09.460 
actually contact stories I'm going to
tap<00:02:05.810> into<00:02:06.050> scenes<00:02:07.210> so<00:02:08.210> in<00:02:08.360> this<00:02:08.539> palette<00:02:09.050> you

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:09.470 
tap into scenes so in this palette you

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:11.950 
tap into scenes so in this palette you
will<00:02:09.619> see<00:02:09.830> two<00:02:10.070> options<00:02:10.210> screens<00:02:11.210> and<00:02:11.570> scenes

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:11.960 
will see two options screens and scenes

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:13.809 
will see two options screens and scenes
right<00:02:12.740> now<00:02:12.950> we<00:02:13.010> have<00:02:13.190> no<00:02:13.370> sir

00:02:13.809 --> 00:02:13.819 
right now we have no sir

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:15.459 
right now we have no sir
means<00:02:13.939> defined<00:02:14.359> so<00:02:14.719> I'm<00:02:14.900> just<00:02:15.079> going<00:02:15.260> to<00:02:15.379> show

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:15.469 
means defined so I'm just going to show

00:02:15.469 --> 00:02:18.069 
means defined so I'm just going to show
you<00:02:15.709> what<00:02:16.010> our<00:02:16.040> scenes<00:02:16.459> have<00:02:16.870> scenes<00:02:17.870> are<00:02:18.049> a

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:18.079 
you what our scenes have scenes are a

00:02:18.079 --> 00:02:19.690 
you what our scenes have scenes are a
set<00:02:18.319> of<00:02:18.349> sketches<00:02:18.859> that<00:02:18.889> either<00:02:19.189> highlight

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:19.700 
set of sketches that either highlight

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:21.670 
set of sketches that either highlight
our<00:02:19.730> context<00:02:20.450> or<00:02:20.599> the<00:02:20.930> person<00:02:21.319> using<00:02:21.499> the

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680 
our context or the person using the

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:24.729 
our context or the person using the
technology<00:02:22.340> so<00:02:23.120> in<00:02:23.239> this<00:02:23.359> case<00:02:23.629> I'm<00:02:23.989> going<00:02:24.049> to

00:02:24.729 --> 00:02:24.739 
technology so in this case I'm going to

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:26.920 
technology so in this case I'm going to
look<00:02:24.950> for<00:02:25.129> something<00:02:25.280> with<00:02:25.489> a<00:02:25.609> phone<00:02:25.879> in<00:02:26.090> it<00:02:26.239> so

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:26.930 
look for something with a phone in it so

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:29.379 
look for something with a phone in it so
just<00:02:27.200> search<00:02:27.379> phone<00:02:27.739> you<00:02:28.700> can<00:02:28.849> also<00:02:28.999> filter

00:02:29.379 --> 00:02:29.389 
just search phone you can also filter

00:02:29.389 --> 00:02:31.390 
just search phone you can also filter
out<00:02:29.629> things<00:02:29.959> you<00:02:30.109> were<00:02:30.200> looking<00:02:30.500> for<00:02:30.739> if<00:02:30.980> you

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:31.400 
out things you were looking for if you

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.220 
out things you were looking for if you
are<00:02:31.489> looking<00:02:31.670> for<00:02:31.849> a<00:02:32.060> male<00:02:32.299> or<00:02:32.510> female<00:02:32.870> persona

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:33.230 
are looking for a male or female persona

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:36.069 
are looking for a male or female persona
you<00:02:33.920> can<00:02:34.099> actually<00:02:34.459> find<00:02:34.700> that<00:02:34.819> here<00:02:35.299> but<00:02:35.930> in

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:36.079 
you can actually find that here but in

00:02:36.079 --> 00:02:37.869 
you can actually find that here but in
this<00:02:36.230> case<00:02:36.500> this<00:02:36.980> one<00:02:37.219> looks<00:02:37.459> like<00:02:37.519> a<00:02:37.639> good

00:02:37.869 --> 00:02:37.879 
this case this one looks like a good

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:39.909 
this case this one looks like a good
candidate<00:02:38.359> so<00:02:38.719> I'm<00:02:38.870> going<00:02:38.900> to<00:02:39.139> drag<00:02:39.439> this<00:02:39.469> on

00:02:39.909 --> 00:02:39.919 
candidate so I'm going to drag this on

00:02:39.919 --> 00:02:43.509 
candidate so I'm going to drag this on
top<00:02:40.129> of<00:02:40.189> the<00:02:40.400> app<00:02:40.519> sketch<00:02:41.650> now<00:02:42.650> as<00:02:43.010> you<00:02:43.310> can<00:02:43.459> see

00:02:43.509 --> 00:02:43.519 
top of the app sketch now as you can see

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:45.940 
top of the app sketch now as you can see
it<00:02:43.999> helps<00:02:44.569> distinguish<00:02:45.079> the<00:02:45.260> app<00:02:45.409> sketches

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:45.950 
it helps distinguish the app sketches

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:48.429 
it helps distinguish the app sketches
from<00:02:46.189> the<00:02:46.280> contact<00:02:46.849> sketches<00:02:47.299> and<00:02:47.510> using<00:02:48.290> this

00:02:48.429 --> 00:02:48.439 
from the contact sketches and using this

00:02:48.439 --> 00:02:50.440 
from the contact sketches and using this
approach<00:02:48.620> I<00:02:49.099> went<00:02:49.609> ahead<00:02:49.700> and<00:02:50.030> laid<00:02:50.209> out<00:02:50.419> my

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:50.450 
approach I went ahead and laid out my

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:54.009 
approach I went ahead and laid out my
entire<00:02:50.810> story<00:02:51.469> board<00:02:52.329> you<00:02:53.329> can<00:02:53.540> clearly<00:02:53.810> see

00:02:54.009 --> 00:02:54.019 
entire story board you can clearly see

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:56.349 
entire story board you can clearly see
how<00:02:54.530> the<00:02:54.590> app<00:02:54.799> actually<00:02:55.099> participates<00:02:56.090> in<00:02:56.299> the

00:02:56.349 --> 00:02:56.359 
how the app actually participates in the

00:02:56.359 --> 00:02:59.649 
how the app actually participates in the
real<00:02:56.659> context<00:02:57.290> story<00:02:57.650> and<00:02:58.449> when<00:02:59.449> you're<00:02:59.629> ready

00:02:59.649 --> 00:02:59.659 
real context story and when you're ready

00:02:59.659 --> 00:03:02.949 
real context story and when you're ready
to<00:03:00.049> start<00:03:00.290> designing<00:03:01.209> find<00:03:02.209> the<00:03:02.359> story<00:03:02.659> step

00:03:02.949 --> 00:03:02.959 
to start designing find the story step

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:05.830 
to start designing find the story step
double<00:03:03.709> click<00:03:03.859> into<00:03:04.340> it<00:03:04.489> and<00:03:04.639> that<00:03:04.840> launches

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:05.840 
double click into it and that launches

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:11.289 
double click into it and that launches
our<00:03:06.019> screen<00:03:06.379> designer<00:03:09.879> which<00:03:10.879> will<00:03:11.090> be<00:03:11.209> the
