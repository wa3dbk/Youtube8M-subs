00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.650
 and the foundation of all I greet it children and 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:06.870
 next german st 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:09.660
 This and 100 ninth level prototypes 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.730
 leopard 1 he prototype me naturally 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:15.089
 suggested not and compare them 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:18.480
 well the body looks almost the same 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:20.599
 the machine is somewhat different anyway 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.919
 they are very similar prototype there is a prototype 

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:24.720
 Immediately go to the characteristics 

00:00:22.919 --> 00:00:27.449
 strength of thousands of 650 units 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:30.150
 40 tons with an engine power of eight hundred 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:31.460
 thirty horsepower maximum 165 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.470
 spinning 42 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:38.220
 drop it in the forehead 70 and the turret 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:40.230
 52 at the turret has practically 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:42.120
 no booking at the same time 10 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.589
 huge strap don't know interrupted or 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.120
 No, but I think of course he makes his way 

00:00:43.589 --> 00:00:49.860
 mask 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:52.219
 thin tower of armor has no body 70 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:55.170
 millimeters of armor is also very, very 

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:57.449
 little but our chip is not on the verge 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.339
 farther up the hen tower at thirty 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:02.460
 six short per second review 400 ce 

00:00:59.339 --> 00:01:04.519
 paintings look for guns level 10 gun 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.790
 five rounds per minute wild break through 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:10.940
 268 units is very very good 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:13.820
 and the damage is almost 400 units this already 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:16.000
 very fine with accuracy 032 and 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:19.510
 information spent two seconds 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:22.070
 it turns out almost the perfect weapon 

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:23.780
 I will put the module for now 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:27.190
 any modules are actually the same 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:27.190
 the most ventilation 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.730
 stabilizers 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:34.850
 I want to stand fast 

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:36.890
 much faster 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:40.150
 as the main shells us when 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:40.150
 liber is not that 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:49.689
 for bird repair kits 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:49.689
 this is a classic choice 

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:57.030
 all the more 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:57.030
 look and we 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:02.870
 here again the fight will be fast to wait 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:04.480
 I really don't want to 

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:05.400
 well i think 

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:08.090
 like now 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:08.090
 that is a huge amount 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:16.799
 principle baby is very very interesting 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:20.049
 she does not at all resemble German tanks 

00:02:16.799 --> 00:02:22.629
 same for armored mighty cars 

00:02:20.049 --> 00:02:24.800
 although the gun is clearly very German 

00:02:22.629 --> 00:02:27.470
 exactly 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:29.720
 fight we found pearl river by the way new 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:32.100
 map I am on it for the first time 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:34.050
 both are ninth levels 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:35.930
 and now we will look at the new one 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:38.030
 card 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:40.420
 specifications alpha for 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:40.420
 parka 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:49.770
 tons 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:51.569
 he looks pleased with this 

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:54.000
 not for me say on 

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:56.870
 I liked Andy Panzer 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:00.290
 I liked the party myself 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:02.720
 iphone leopard move away on the interface we 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:04.930
 not yet attached properly to my 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:07.689
 look but i may be wrong 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:09.340
 so here it is especially one new card 

00:03:07.689 --> 00:03:11.510
 the base is in the mountains 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:13.940
 another around the corner at 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:16.500
 traversal left and right 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:18.540
 but in principle 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:22.520
 It seems to me very different 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:24.220
 I don't know how to defend myself 

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:27.910
 I think this is so left 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:29.020
 a bunch of st she is right such an item and t right 

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:31.420
 narrow passage 

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:32.440
 the exit of the merime so only seems 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:34.330
 map 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:35.560
 I do not know what could be wrong here somewhere 

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:37.709
 cities 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:37.709
 skil 

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:43.800
 but back to the map 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:46.970
 back to the movement I'm 

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:49.850
 the most important show tank 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:50.630
 here is our speed of 50 km an hour however I am going 

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:53.350
 on water 

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:53.350
 ground 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:59.030
 grip will improve 

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:00.720
 50 frames we 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:02.790
 serving easy enough 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:05.360
 more we do not want to issue but there is 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:06.270
 port hills in the fossa 

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:08.000
 spy tank 

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:09.560
 and the speed is not bad 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.390
 will be there and 

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:14.140
 we are cool 

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:14.140
 fast enough 

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:17.980
 solid 

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:19.600
 just a pleasure 

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:21.520
 until we whirl something we can 

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:23.650
 circle everyone calmly become exactly and 

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:27.030
 look at accuracy by example i wish 

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:27.030
 get here 

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:31.920
 in exact 

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:31.920
 a little bit gone problems 

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:35.200
 errors 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:37.350
 free small 1 

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:40.280
 he will give them not to be settled 

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:40.280
 your commander 

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:45.409
 repeat shot this hill get a 

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:48.270
 the fire 

00:04:45.409 --> 00:04:50.600
 miracle five in the upper right corner 

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:53.810
 and the projectile flew 

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:56.590
 maybe some sort of marriage rouen 

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:59.980
 very thin joke 

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:59.980
 type of laughing 

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:03.449
 now you can go fight 

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:10.750
 people still do not know how 10 of this map 

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:10.750
 right flank gave away completely 

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:21.380
 but it was a very bad idea 

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:24.550
 we are not as often as with t 8 and 10 level 5 

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:27.800
 thousand with a minute at other levels 

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:30.210
 but go water German 100 

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:34.560
 very good 

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:36.810
 need to go for some house yes 

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:39.390
 naturally got it a very bad idea 

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:42.260
 ride under the nose 

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:42.260
 4 opponents 

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:46.790
 With a cache on ignorance of the card we will write off on 

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:50.410
 ignorance of the card on now we write on 

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:50.410
 opportunity to shoot at targets 

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:57.880
 032 well, come on 032 you have to get 

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:07.040
 032 I really like guns day 

00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:09.890
 would shoot a little faster prices he wouldn't 

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:12.250
 was i see the artillery she should 

00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:12.250
 die 

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:20.040
 Strangely, I wanted to go wherever in general 

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:22.230
 matter tank I showed it dynamically 

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:23.390
 wanted gun sticks naturally me 

00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:25.129
 killed 

00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:30.380
 hastily not for 

00:06:25.129 --> 00:06:33.040
 and maps on my given thick tanks 

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:33.040
 all good
