00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:03.850
 but you see the feeling ever 

00:00:01.570 --> 00:00:06.730
 was not there had not liked it 

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:12.370
 then so much us and the situation that 

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:15.070
 he gave and now there is a kim state miki 

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:18.070
 ando he looks at everyone from above and if he does 

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:19.869
 deserves because it has a score of 58 58 and is 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:23.490
 beautiful now let's see who you are 

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:23.490
 yu na kim carnes olympic 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.470
 by itself it does not go 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.720
 fine triple but attacking voice actors 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.250
 excellent of the building 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:14.690
 you flew into the mega sports arena also 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:16.490
 I still say my name was 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:17.900
 the most beautiful we've seen up 

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:19.850
 now this obviously my own 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:22.010
 feeling is what tells us that 

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:24.680
 it comes to us from the ice as we see it 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:26.270
 then off she is wonderful 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:27.800
 he had the attention of all I would have 

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:30.230
 made to hear the noise of 

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:33.180
 cameras while she was 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:35.819
 on the frank ice 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:37.620
 then it is true overall the 

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:40.500
 best performance in my opinion of 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:44.159
 day is miki ando e credo 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:46.650
 that so will she have been very good and 

00:03:44.159 --> 00:03:48.510
 very ready of spirit because the first one 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:51.090
 combination had to be triple lutz 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:53.069
 triple toe loop and then it should have 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:54.689
 doing the triple flip alone is not 

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:57.420
 succeeded to arrive well from the triple lutz 

00:03:54.689 --> 00:03:59.340
 then he decided to leave it there as the 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:01.109
 jump alone even if I'm not sure 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:03.689
 there were meals before then a bit of 

00:04:01.109 --> 00:04:06.209
 deduction should have it anyway e 

00:04:03.689 --> 00:04:08.549
 then attached the double top to triple 

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:10.379
 flip instead that followed you know what is me 

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:15.299
 particularly liked this change 

00:04:10.379 --> 00:04:17.609
 in total style of a kim now is more 

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:20.250
 this part almost matures 

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:23.370
 also the expression of the face and the 

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:25.560
 very different facial mimic on the 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:28.860
 ice itself is very different from the last 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:32.910
 year where did this james bond with 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:36.030
 rare beautiful fixed with even as much 

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:38.340
 mimicry but not this drama held 

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:40.740
 really the scene as an interpretation 

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:43.050
 I would say that it was certainly the best 

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:45.300
 under this point of view 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:48.740
 then for the rest the performance in his 

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:51.990
 together it was not completely 

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:53.909
 sliding and I think he paid that 

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:56.099
 we were talking from the ingenuity of sin 

00:04:53.909 --> 00:04:58.860
 having ever beaten to tax level 

00:04:56.099 --> 00:05:01.260
 this program there was some point of the 

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:05.400
 program a little bit empty without 

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:07.620
 tension without involvement for 

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:08.639
 this at the level of feeling the 

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:12.449
 niche program was more 

00:05:08.639 --> 00:05:15.720
 engaging we see it even if in rai 

00:05:12.449 --> 00:05:18.180
 with his new coach PiterÃ  or pay is 

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:19.800
 waiting for the area won silver a 

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:21.780
 torino the current Olympic champion 

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:27.469
 and it is from the turin world championship that it does not 

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:33.809
 we had more in the race you're done 591 

00:05:27.469 --> 00:05:37.770
 active command with miki ando of 65 and 58 

00:05:33.809 --> 00:05:41.580
 we see now in particular 30 297 

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:44.999
 as for the poet while I am 

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:47.900
 lower than miki ando who has 34 

00:05:44.999 --> 00:05:47.900
 events
