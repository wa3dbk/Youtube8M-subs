00:04:58.909 --> 00:04:58.919 
off originally hold this big difference

00:04:58.919 --> 00:05:01.340 
off originally hold this big difference
between<00:04:59.250> this<00:04:59.430> this<00:04:59.850> IPS<00:05:00.570> piece<00:05:00.780> of<00:05:01.139> and

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:01.350 
between this this IPS piece of and

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:03.650 
between this this IPS piece of and
this<00:05:01.500> piece<00:05:01.710> so<00:05:02.010> it's<00:05:02.880> gonna<00:05:02.970> be<00:05:03.180> exactly<00:05:03.540> the

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:03.660 
this piece so it's gonna be exactly the

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:06.710 
this piece so it's gonna be exactly the
same<00:05:03.720> size<00:05:04.580> four<00:05:05.580> poles<00:05:05.850> covering<00:05:06.360> exactly

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:06.720 
same size four poles covering exactly

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:07.970 
same size four poles covering exactly
how<00:05:06.810> it<00:05:06.960> is<00:05:07.080> I<00:05:07.320> think<00:05:07.620> it's<00:05:07.740> going<00:05:07.860> to<00:05:07.889> be

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:07.980 
how it is I think it's going to be

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:11.180 
how it is I think it's going to be
better<00:05:08.130> off<00:05:08.310> anyway<00:05:08.430> I<00:05:08.790> turn<00:05:09.090> off<00:05:10.010> alright<00:05:11.010> so
