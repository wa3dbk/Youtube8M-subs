I'm<00:01:33.130> using<00:01:33.460> the<00:01:33.790> tweezer<00:01:34.780> man<00:01:35.140> I<00:01:35.880> think<00:01:36.880> it's

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:37.000 
I'm using the tweezer man I think it's

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.260 
I'm using the tweezer man I think it's
called<00:01:37.180> the<00:01:37.300> mini<00:01:37.510> slant<00:01:37.990> and<00:01:38.320> I<00:01:39.070> always<00:01:39.520> use<00:01:39.880> a

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:40.270 
called the mini slant and I always use a

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:42.930 
called the mini slant and I always use a
tweezer<00:01:40.690> and<00:01:40.930> that<00:01:41.230> looks<00:01:41.740> like<00:01:41.940> it's

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:42.940 
tweezer and that looks like it's

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:45.480 
tweezer and that looks like it's
wrapping<00:01:43.300> paper<00:01:43.480> so<00:01:43.890> they<00:01:44.890> just<00:01:45.040> work<00:01:45.220> better

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:45.490
