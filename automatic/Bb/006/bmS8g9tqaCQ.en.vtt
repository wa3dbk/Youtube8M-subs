00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:08.390 
it's completely new but six in every

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:11.440 
it's completely new but six in every
single<00:04:08.569> stats<00:04:08.900> but<00:04:09.859> look<00:04:10.040> at<00:04:10.129> that<00:04:10.250> XP<00:04:10.700> it's

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:11.450 
single stats but look at that XP it's

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:17.229 
single stats but look at that XP it's
like<00:04:13.060> 700,000<00:04:14.060> it's<00:04:14.840> really<00:04:15.170> high<00:04:15.430> so<00:04:16.430> you're

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:17.239 
like 700,000 it's really high so you're

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:19.870 
like 700,000 it's really high so you're
probably<00:04:17.359> wondering<00:04:17.889> how<00:04:18.889> the<00:04:18.949> heck<00:04:19.130> do<00:04:19.850> we

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:19.880 
probably wondering how the heck do we

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:23.560 
probably wondering how the heck do we
get<00:04:20.090> it<00:04:20.209> to<00:04:20.239> level<00:04:20.479> up<00:04:21.460> and<00:04:22.460> get<00:04:22.820> it<00:04:22.940> to<00:04:23.120> me<00:04:23.300> off

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:23.570 
get it to level up and get it to me off

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:26.950 
get it to level up and get it to me off
that<00:04:23.960> very<00:04:24.710> XP<00:04:25.280> well<00:04:26.000> it's<00:04:26.240> actually<00:04:26.360> level<00:04:26.780> 1

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:26.960 
that very XP well it's actually level 1

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:29.379 
that very XP well it's actually level 1
but<00:04:27.260> at<00:04:27.889> XP<00:04:28.340> it's<00:04:28.580> actually<00:04:28.699> in<00:04:28.940> the<00:04:29.030> negatives

00:04:29.379 --> 00:04:29.389 
but at XP it's actually in the negatives

00:04:29.389 --> 00:04:30.640 
but at XP it's actually in the negatives
so<00:04:29.900> what<00:04:30.020> we're<00:04:30.110> gonna<00:04:30.169> do<00:04:30.380> is<00:04:30.470> we're<00:04:30.560> gonna
