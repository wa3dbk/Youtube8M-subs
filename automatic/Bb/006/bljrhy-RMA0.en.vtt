street fighter 4 which is very like you
know<00:01:29.700> it's<00:01:29.909> it's<00:01:30.060> own<00:01:30.210> place<00:01:30.659> on<00:01:30.810> it<00:01:30.900> to

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
know it's it's own place on it to

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.270 
know it's it's own place on it to
complain<00:01:31.380> a<00:01:31.560> little<00:01:31.650> bit<00:01:31.829> closer<00:01:31.979> you<00:01:32.159> don't

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
complain a little bit closer you don't

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.090 
complain a little bit closer you don't
need<00:01:32.430> it<00:01:32.549> that<00:01:32.670> far<00:01:32.880> so<00:01:33.150> it<00:01:33.659> just<00:01:33.869> depends<00:01:34.140> the

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
need it that far so it just depends the

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.490 
need it that far so it just depends the
moving<00:01:35.490> down<00:01:35.700> lists<00:01:36.090> is<00:01:36.360> the<00:01:36.840> circle<00:01:37.110> pad<00:01:37.140> a

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
moving down lists is the circle pad a

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.649 
moving down lists is the circle pad a
circle<00:01:38.159> pad<00:01:38.280> of<00:01:38.430> course<00:01:38.610> move<00:01:39.000> a<00:01:39.150> little<00:01:39.180> get<00:01:39.630> a

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
circle pad of course move a little get a

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.230 
circle pad of course move a little get a
little<00:01:39.750> move<00:01:40.229> a<00:01:40.320> lot<00:01:40.470> get<00:01:40.680> a<00:01:40.710> lot<00:01:40.890> so<00:01:41.579> it's<00:01:42.060> very

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
little move a lot get a lot so it's very

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.539 
little move a lot get a lot so it's very
similar<00:01:42.479> to<00:01:42.600> you<00:01:43.049> know<00:01:43.250> being<00:01:44.250> able<00:01:44.310> to

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
similar to you know being able to

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.219 
similar to you know being able to
control<00:01:44.970> your<00:01:45.119> character<00:01:45.600> or<00:01:45.899> whatever

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
you're doing a little bit more precisely

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.280 
you're doing a little bit more precisely
than<00:01:47.610> you<00:01:47.759> will<00:01:47.909> with<00:01:47.939> just<00:01:48.299> a<00:01:48.540> standard<00:01:48.960> d-pad
