00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:05.520
 i 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:14.490
 and what a welcome wave to a new 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.839
 code podcast facilitated where 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.869
 we share resources for 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:21.239
 developers let's start we have 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:24.840
 interesting stuff 

00:00:21.239 --> 00:00:27.480
 the first one is an interface kit 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:30.149
 graph for an application your list 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.950
 is in photoshop with sketch where 

00:00:30.149 --> 00:00:34.110
 you prefer 

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:36.960
 it's very interesting is very complete 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:40.620
 it's from the people of invision app 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:43.470
 then and vision ship is a platform 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.180
 to create prototypes for applications 

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:46.680
 mobile then it's very interesting 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.989
 that they share these here are 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.930
 All the designs you can use 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:54.809
 you in an application of things for 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.750
 do so review what can 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:59.240
 download the photoshop 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:01.160
 the second recommendation is a 

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:03.770
 implementation of the group effect of 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:06.910
 material design for your applications in 

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:10.070
 android that's one of my favorites of 

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:12.080
 of material design then here can 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:14.300
 see that it works with icons that works 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:16.670
 with buttons then it's very 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:19.250
 interesting and obviously the effect is 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:22.850
 create from where you click with it 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:27.650
 rather where is it with in your application 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:31.100
 from android comes out after godofredo at 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:34.310
 godofredo ninja recommended us this one 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:37.240
 complete kit of material design for 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:40.880
 illustrator then so that they can 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:42.740
 market design or prototype their 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:47.550
 Web applications 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:51.900
 illustrator comes out after we have 

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:54.210
 kn w point is that it is a pair of the 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:56.670
 natural language in javascript then for 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.530
 example continue as here is a good 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.620
 amount of text that you can 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:04.140
 modify you give pars and here it shows you 

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:06.720
 all the information that he extracted from that 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:09.390
 of this chain 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:11.130
 in different categories the emails the 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:15.300
 links the phones 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:18.060
 the times the dates and so on then 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:20.190
 if your application was using something 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:22.470
 related to processing of 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:24.940
 natural language you can use kn w 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:28.570
 laws 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:30.880
 is more chic with his gift 250 and with the 

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:33.930
 free then they are very 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:37.350
 interesting also come in colors and 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:40.480
 in full colors in a single color 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:43.120
 etc. can be downloaded for free 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:45.730
 here in smart and cons 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:47.950
 also very interesting, I like it 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:49.780
 a lot because I think I 'm going to have it 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:52.810
 what to use in some projects is 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:55.450
 between charts is based on vitro and 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:57.670
 jesse is a graphics library for 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:03:00.370
 angular to integrate with aguilar ideas 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:06.350
 so here are the examples and how 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:11.420
 how they are created then 

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:14.350
 there are several very complex graphs and 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:16.340
 here they can see how they even have 

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:19.820
 activities with the mouse because they are 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:22.210
 based on vitro and it is then if they have 

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:25.040
 that showing graphs in your application is 

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:29.540
 it's interesting that they can do it 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:32.660
 with angular and with / charts and in ok 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:34.910
 the zeta noc not share for 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:36.410
 podcast but we decided to take their 

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:39.950
 recommendations 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:42.770
 tex tex which is another platform for 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:45.650
 power this 

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:48.560
 share the stack of different 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:51.800
 startups then for example for the 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:55.280
 databases we have networks and mysql 

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:57.290
 They are widely used in cassette for 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:59.450
 the programming languages this part 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:01.850
 have erupted this rudy in languages 

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:04.130
 in the client we have these and then 

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:05.900
 here you can see who are the ones 

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:08.750
 are using for example rubén and 

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:11.900
 twitter well bishop ifai square tumblr 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:14.320
 twitter and etcetera etc. it goes out for 

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:16.970
 those who are using python then 

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:20.480
 because I should load google instagram 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:22.850
 spotify interest but want to be not 

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:24.200
 should be uber etcetera then if 

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:26.210
 you want to know what the big ones use 

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:28.400
 companies or what technologies are more 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:31.070
 sued by the big here and here 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:33.970
 you can also know waka time 

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:36.350
 I also liked it a lot 

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:38.900
 quantifier of the code that you write is 

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:42.140
 integrate with the ires that you can be 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:45.170
 using sublime sex code 

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:47.440
 android studio and from that you 

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:50.540
 generates graphics that you are working on 

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:53.140
 how much time do you spend per day how many 

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:56.330
 projects you have and there are even some 

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:59.150
 leaderboards of the people who most 

00:04:56.330 --> 00:05:00.800
 that more programs of these parts by 

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:04.789
 example william to our man dedicate 

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:08.990
 9 hours and 36 minutes to program php 

00:05:04.789 --> 00:05:11.169
 it is written html ruby ​​and so on 

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:13.029
 so 

00:05:11.169 --> 00:05:15.009
 I'm going to install it to see how 

00:05:13.029 --> 00:05:17.110
 as new what are the statistics 

00:05:15.009 --> 00:05:20.379
 what record of the time I develop 

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:22.029
 sale good picnic is also a 

00:05:20.379 --> 00:05:25.060
 recommendation that I long wanted them 

00:05:22.029 --> 00:05:28.599
 I wanted to share them basically 

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:30.550
 allows you to copy a terminal that can 

00:05:28.599 --> 00:05:33.999
 contain different languages ​​code 

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:37.230
 and that is executable on your website 

00:05:33.999 --> 00:05:38.969
 so for example it is very cool for 

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:42.569
 i 

00:05:38.969 --> 00:05:46.019
 if for example they want to share the 

00:05:42.569 --> 00:05:48.239
 documentation of your platform here by 

00:05:46.019 --> 00:05:51.209
 example they have in the demos some 

00:05:48.239 --> 00:05:52.949
 some examples for example strike how 

00:05:51.209 --> 00:05:55.169
 do as connect with scratch is 

00:05:52.949 --> 00:05:58.289
 tracta here the console will appear 

00:05:55.169 --> 00:06:00.449
 so here we are going to have the 

00:05:58.289 --> 00:06:05.369
 code or the files that come 

00:06:00.449 --> 00:06:07.679
 contained in this in this package are 

00:06:05.369 --> 00:06:10.199
 based on docker then it's very 

00:06:07.679 --> 00:06:12.899
 interesting we also have for example 

00:06:10.199 --> 00:06:15.119
 an example with connect here comes the 

00:06:12.899 --> 00:06:16.860
 code and you can execute it from the 

00:06:15.119 --> 00:06:20.090
 terminals that they have you can 

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:22.639
 see in web version 

00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:24.020
 so I think I think it 's something very 

00:06:22.639 --> 00:06:26.840
 interesting that is for example by 

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:29.180
 example with react check in code 

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:29.900
 big if they have a blog where they share 

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:31.100
 code 

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:35.300
 this is how they should 

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:38.960
 to be doing it comes out in yecla if it's a 

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:40.850
 script 6 integration that is the 

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:43.490
 following javascript specification 

00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:45.889
 that we know they are going to have classes and 

00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:47.600
 other very interesting things and about what 

00:06:45.889 --> 00:06:51.139
 which will be based angular 2 

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:53.479
 then this is techno scripts inc for 

00:06:51.139 --> 00:06:55.130
 angular 1 comes out then here you can see 

00:06:53.479 --> 00:06:58.830
 the documentation of how you would describe 

00:06:55.130 --> 00:07:00.480
 with with classes 

00:06:58.830 --> 00:07:02.880
 here for example is declared in a 

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:04.290
 class writes its eel code 

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:07.350
 tricks then it's also very 

00:07:04.290 --> 00:07:08.970
 interesting and for those who are interested 

00:07:07.350 --> 00:07:10.920
 the design are developing 

00:07:08.970 --> 00:07:14.730
 applications for android seems like a 

00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:17.700
 terrific article because of the action 

00:07:14.730 --> 00:07:20.250
 floating this little yellow button and this 

00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:21.630
 this is a bad idea for the 

00:07:20.250 --> 00:07:24.090
 user experience seems to me that 

00:07:21.630 --> 00:07:27.380
 has very good points like for example 

00:07:24.090 --> 00:07:31.470
 here is covering part of the content or 

00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:34.760
 normally the main action is not what 

00:07:31.470 --> 00:07:37.160
 what else we use for example in gmail 

00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:39.830
 What we do most is read emails 

00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:41.900
 write emails and especially in the 

00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:46.070
 mobile versions of the mail then 

00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:47.870
 so it is tedious for me to be 

00:07:46.070 --> 00:07:50.540
 experience that the button is there 

00:07:47.870 --> 00:07:52.250
 bothering you always then take it 

00:07:50.540 --> 00:07:54.200
 very much in mind also mentions cases 

00:07:52.250 --> 00:07:55.340
 where the button is perfect as in 

00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:58.160
 google maps 

00:07:55.340 --> 00:08:00.230
 then read it and maybe I can give you 

00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:02.060
 some ideas for your for the 

00:08:00.230 --> 00:08:03.830
 experience of your next applications 

00:08:02.060 --> 00:08:05.750
 then up to here today's podcast 

00:08:03.830 --> 00:08:08.150
 I hope you liked it remember 

00:08:05.750 --> 00:08:11.210
 that the links are in the description 

00:08:08.150 --> 00:08:14.420
 of the video and remember also that we 

00:08:11.210 --> 00:08:16.040
 can send their recommendations and 

00:08:14.420 --> 00:08:19.150
 we're going to be showing here so 

00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:19.150
 thank you very much
