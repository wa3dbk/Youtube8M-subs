and<00:02:51.629> sprayed<00:02:51.989> as<00:02:52.200> I<00:02:52.290> did<00:02:52.439> with<00:02:52.590> coadley<00:02:53.099> where

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
and sprayed as I did with coadley where

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:54.830 
and sprayed as I did with coadley where
I<00:02:53.430> just<00:02:53.730> felt<00:02:53.970> like<00:02:54.030> it<00:02:54.269> was<00:02:54.359> such<00:02:54.480> a<00:02:54.569> strong

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
I just felt like it was such a strong

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.649 
I just felt like it was such a strong
wash<00:02:55.409> on<00:02:55.680> my<00:02:55.889> face<00:02:56.159> and<00:02:56.459> in<00:02:56.700> felt<00:02:57.239> a<00:02:57.299> bit<00:02:57.419> silly

00:02:57.649 --> 00:02:57.659 
wash on my face and in felt a bit silly

00:02:57.659 --> 00:02:58.849 
wash on my face and in felt a bit silly
because<00:02:57.780> I<00:02:58.019> just<00:02:58.169> looked<00:02:58.349> like<00:02:58.469> how<00:02:58.620> to<00:02:58.680> walk

00:02:58.849 --> 00:02:58.859 
because I just looked like how to walk

00:02:58.859 --> 00:03:00.830 
because I just looked like how to walk
from<00:02:59.069> my<00:02:59.250> face<00:02:59.489> whereas<00:02:59.849> I<00:02:59.939> think<00:02:59.969> coadley<00:03:00.780> is

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
from my face whereas I think coadley is

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:02.899 
from my face whereas I think coadley is
a<00:03:01.019> bit<00:03:01.200> more<00:03:01.349> fine<00:03:01.620> and<00:03:02.280> I<00:03:02.370> think<00:03:02.519> that's<00:03:02.669> to<00:03:02.819> do

00:03:02.899 --> 00:03:02.909 
a bit more fine and I think that's to do

00:03:02.909 --> 00:03:04.309 
a bit more fine and I think that's to do
with<00:03:02.939> the<00:03:03.090> canister<00:03:03.389> itself<00:03:03.629> it's<00:03:04.019> a<00:03:04.079> bit<00:03:04.200> more

00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:04.319 
with the canister itself it's a bit more

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:06.830 
with the canister itself it's a bit more
of<00:03:04.409> a<00:03:04.469> fine<00:03:04.680> mist<00:03:04.980> and<00:03:05.310> it's<00:03:05.760> I'd<00:03:06.329> feel<00:03:06.599> it<00:03:06.750> on

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
of a fine mist and it's I'd feel it on

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:08.809 
of a fine mist and it's I'd feel it on
my<00:03:06.870> skin<00:03:07.200> it<00:03:07.319> feels<00:03:07.349> cooling<00:03:08.189> and<00:03:08.519> but<00:03:08.760> it

00:03:08.809 --> 00:03:08.819 
my skin it feels cooling and but it

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:10.369 
my skin it feels cooling and but it
doesn't<00:03:09.060> feel<00:03:09.180> like<00:03:09.239> it's<00:03:09.599> washed<00:03:09.959> off<00:03:10.169> my

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:36.090 
spray or magic toner some may say and

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:38.089 
spray or magic toner some may say and
and<00:03:36.479> it's<00:03:36.599> held<00:03:36.780> up<00:03:36.930> pretty<00:03:37.049> well<00:03:37.229> I'd<00:03:37.560> say<00:03:37.859> I

00:03:38.089 --> 00:03:38.099 
and it's held up pretty well I'd say I

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:40.759 
and it's held up pretty well I'd say I
think<00:03:38.209> it's<00:03:39.209> I<00:03:39.689> mean<00:03:39.840> one<00:03:40.109> of<00:03:40.139> the<00:03:40.290> factors<00:03:40.650> to

00:03:40.759 --> 00:03:40.769 
think it's I mean one of the factors to

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:42.319 
think it's I mean one of the factors to
bear<00:03:40.949> in<00:03:41.099> mind<00:03:41.310> and<00:03:41.579> that<00:03:41.699> is<00:03:41.760> that<00:03:42.030> I<00:03:42.060> probably

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:42.329 
bear in mind and that is that I probably

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:44.270 
bear in mind and that is that I probably
haven't<00:03:42.750> been<00:03:42.780> as<00:03:43.109> busy<00:03:43.349> or<00:03:43.739> as<00:03:43.859> rushing

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:44.280 
haven't been as busy or as rushing

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:46.490 
haven't been as busy or as rushing
around<00:03:44.459> as<00:03:45.000> I<00:03:45.209> have<00:03:45.810> been<00:03:46.019> with<00:03:46.079> some<00:03:46.349> of<00:03:46.439> the

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:46.500 
around as I have been with some of the

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:48.309 
around as I have been with some of the
other<00:03:46.650> finishing<00:03:47.159> products<00:03:47.489> I've<00:03:47.669> tried<00:03:48.060> and

00:03:48.309 --> 00:03:48.319 
other finishing products I've tried and

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:51.050 
other finishing products I've tried and
nor<00:03:49.319> have<00:03:49.530> I<00:03:49.650> been<00:03:49.829> out<00:03:49.949> in<00:03:50.009> the<00:03:50.189> baking<00:03:50.609> Sun<00:03:50.909> so

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.060 
nor have I been out in the baking Sun so

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:52.759 
nor have I been out in the baking Sun so
there's<00:03:51.239> two<00:03:51.419> things<00:03:51.449> to<00:03:51.780> bear<00:03:52.049> in<00:03:52.079> mind<00:03:52.439> in

00:03:52.759 --> 00:03:52.769 
there's two things to bear in mind in

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:54.800 
there's two things to bear in mind in
terms<00:03:52.949> of<00:03:53.189> it<00:03:53.310> probably<00:03:53.609> not<00:03:53.790> being<00:03:54.030> put

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:54.810 
terms of it probably not being put

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:57.559 
terms of it probably not being put
through<00:03:54.840> its<00:03:55.079> paces<00:03:55.139> in<00:03:55.680> as<00:03:55.919> much<00:03:56.129> and<00:03:56.509> in<00:03:57.509> a

00:03:57.559 --> 00:03:57.569 
through its paces in as much and in a

00:03:57.569 --> 00:03:59.719 
through its paces in as much and in a
sort<00:03:57.900> of<00:03:57.989> much<00:03:58.259> away<00:03:58.680> as<00:03:58.949> the<00:03:59.220> other<00:03:59.340> end

00:03:59.719 --> 00:03:59.729 
sort of much away as the other end

00:03:59.729 --> 00:04:01.819 
sort of much away as the other end
products<00:04:00.090> I've<00:04:00.239> tried<00:04:00.479> have<00:04:00.870> but<00:04:01.470> nonetheless

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:01.829 
products I've tried have but nonetheless

00:04:01.829 --> 00:04:05.960 
products I've tried have but nonetheless
it<00:04:02.729> has<00:04:02.790> been<00:04:03.829> lightweight<00:04:04.829> it<00:04:05.370> literally<00:04:05.790> has

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:05.970 
it has been lightweight it literally has

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:08.210 
it has been lightweight it literally has
felt<00:04:06.239> like<00:04:06.389> spring<00:04:06.599> water<00:04:06.959> on<00:04:07.229> my<00:04:07.439> face<00:04:07.470> and<00:04:07.889> I

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:08.220 
felt like spring water on my face and I

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:10.249 
felt like spring water on my face and I
think<00:04:08.609> it's<00:04:08.970> done<00:04:09.150> a<00:04:09.209> better<00:04:09.329> job<00:04:09.449> dare<00:04:09.930> I<00:04:09.959> say

00:04:10.249 --> 00:04:10.259 
think it's done a better job dare I say

00:04:10.259 --> 00:04:12.229 
think it's done a better job dare I say
then<00:04:10.500> the<00:04:10.680> m-code<00:04:11.310> early<00:04:11.609> beauty<00:04:12.000> elixir

00:04:12.229 --> 00:04:12.239 
then the m-code early beauty elixir

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:14.599 
then the m-code early beauty elixir
which<00:04:12.750> I<00:04:12.900> tried<00:04:13.319> in<00:04:13.650> one<00:04:13.829> of<00:04:13.919> my<00:04:14.040> other<00:04:14.189> reviews

00:04:14.599 --> 00:04:14.609 
which I tried in one of my other reviews

00:04:14.609 --> 00:04:16.879 
which I tried in one of my other reviews
so<00:04:14.970> I<00:04:15.180> think<00:04:15.569> it's<00:04:15.900> pretty<00:04:16.049> decent<00:04:16.560> I<00:04:16.650> think

00:04:16.879 --> 00:04:16.889 
so I think it's pretty decent I think

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:18.560 
so I think it's pretty decent I think
what<00:04:17.280> it<00:04:17.370> hasn't<00:04:17.729> it<00:04:17.820> is<00:04:17.940> it<00:04:18.060> hasn't<00:04:18.299> probably

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:18.570 
what it hasn't it is it hasn't probably

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:20.180 
what it hasn't it is it hasn't probably
enhanced<00:04:18.989> my<00:04:19.079> foundation<00:04:19.680> where<00:04:19.859> the<00:04:20.039> bare

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:20.190 
enhanced my foundation where the bare

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:22.310 
enhanced my foundation where the bare
minerals<00:04:20.430> did<00:04:20.849> and<00:04:21.209> actually<00:04:21.389> brightened<00:04:22.079> I

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:22.320 
minerals did and actually brightened I

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:25.339 
minerals did and actually brightened I
think<00:04:22.919> it's<00:04:23.190> in<00:04:23.430> more<00:04:23.969> dewy<00:04:24.270> than<00:04:24.719> matte<00:04:25.050> but

00:04:25.339 --> 00:04:25.349 
think it's in more dewy than matte but

00:04:25.349 --> 00:04:27.200 
think it's in more dewy than matte but
at<00:04:25.500> the<00:04:25.590> same<00:04:25.740> time<00:04:25.979> I<00:04:26.039> don't<00:04:26.190> be<00:04:26.760> a<00:04:26.789> looking

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:27.210 
at the same time I don't be a looking

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:27.480 
at the same time I don't be a looking
guy

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:27.490 
guy

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:29.550 
guy
like<00:04:27.669> this<00:04:27.910> you<00:04:28.509> know<00:04:28.630> an<00:04:28.780> old<00:04:28.900> Fiat<00:04:29.080> amount<00:04:29.440> of

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:29.560 
like this you know an old Fiat amount of

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:31.830 
like this you know an old Fiat amount of
shine<00:04:29.830> I'm<00:04:30.039> sure<00:04:30.280> the<00:04:30.490> camera<00:04:31.479> will<00:04:31.630> look

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:31.840 
shine I'm sure the camera will look

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:34.680 
shine I'm sure the camera will look
different<00:04:32.349> but<00:04:32.860> from<00:04:33.520> what<00:04:33.669> I<00:04:33.699> see<00:04:34.000> looking<00:04:34.389> in

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:34.690 
different but from what I see looking in

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:36.900 
different but from what I see looking in
the<00:04:34.840> mirror<00:04:35.020> it's<00:04:35.289> not<00:04:35.500> too<00:04:35.680> shiny<00:04:35.919> so<00:04:36.400> no

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:36.910 
the mirror it's not too shiny so no

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:39.749 
the mirror it's not too shiny so no
overall<00:04:37.360> I<00:04:37.449> think<00:04:37.780> it's<00:04:38.139> actually<00:04:38.610> not<00:04:39.610> a<00:04:39.669> bad

00:04:39.749 --> 00:04:39.759 
overall I think it's actually not a bad

00:04:39.759 --> 00:04:42.749 
overall I think it's actually not a bad
option<00:04:40.030> I<00:04:40.389> think<00:04:40.419> my<00:04:40.949> contouring<00:04:41.949> has<00:04:42.490> also

00:04:42.749 --> 00:04:42.759 
option I think my contouring has also

00:04:42.759 --> 00:04:44.629 
option I think my contouring has also
stayed<00:04:43.210> put<00:04:43.479> which<00:04:43.660> goes<00:04:43.960> to<00:04:44.169> show<00:04:44.380> that

00:04:44.629 --> 00:04:44.639 
stayed put which goes to show that

00:04:44.639 --> 00:04:46.969 
stayed put which goes to show that
despite<00:04:45.639> it<00:04:45.819> being<00:04:45.849> a<00:04:46.120> walker<00:04:46.330> and<00:04:46.539> my<00:04:46.690> initial

00:04:46.969 --> 00:04:46.979 
despite it being a walker and my initial

00:04:46.979 --> 00:04:49.499 
despite it being a walker and my initial
suspicions<00:04:47.979> about<00:04:48.280> it<00:04:48.430> just<00:04:48.610> in<00:04:48.819> washing<00:04:49.389> my

00:04:49.499 --> 00:04:49.509 
suspicions about it just in washing my

00:04:49.509 --> 00:04:53.400 
suspicions about it just in washing my
makeup<00:04:49.870> off<00:04:50.020> it<00:04:50.530> hasn't<00:04:50.979> really<00:04:51.190> done<00:04:51.759> that<00:04:52.410> so

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:53.410 
makeup off it hasn't really done that so

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:54.749 
makeup off it hasn't really done that so
I<00:04:53.440> think<00:04:53.770> you<00:04:54.009> know<00:04:54.099> it's<00:04:54.250> pretty<00:04:54.430> it's<00:04:54.669> a

00:04:54.749 --> 00:04:54.759 
I think you know it's pretty it's a

00:04:54.759 --> 00:04:56.969 
I think you know it's pretty it's a
pretty<00:04:54.910> decent<00:04:55.150> option<00:04:55.690> I'd<00:04:55.900> say<00:04:56.110> the<00:04:56.680> only

00:04:56.969 --> 00:04:56.979 
pretty decent option I'd say the only

00:04:56.979 --> 00:04:59.249 
pretty decent option I'd say the only
aim<00:04:57.430> caveat<00:04:58.060> is<00:04:58.210> that<00:04:58.419> I<00:04:58.449> probably<00:04:58.750> haven't

00:04:59.249 --> 00:04:59.259 
aim caveat is that I probably haven't

00:04:59.259 --> 00:05:01.890 
aim caveat is that I probably haven't
been<00:04:59.410> as<00:04:59.860> rigorous<00:05:00.400> in<00:05:00.639> my<00:05:00.849> routine<00:05:01.389> in<00:05:01.810> the

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:01.900 
been as rigorous in my routine in the

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:03.240 
been as rigorous in my routine in the
last<00:05:02.050> couple<00:05:02.259> of<00:05:02.380> hours<00:05:02.530> about<00:05:02.860> her<00:05:02.949> as<00:05:03.130> I<00:05:03.220> have

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:03.250 
last couple of hours about her as I have

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:06.149 
last couple of hours about her as I have
with<00:05:03.580> the<00:05:03.759> other<00:05:04.300> products<00:05:04.810> so<00:05:05.020> that's<00:05:05.740> my

00:05:06.149 --> 00:05:06.159 
with the other products so that's my

00:05:06.159 --> 00:05:07.950 
with the other products so that's my
thoughts<00:05:06.610> on<00:05:06.819> this<00:05:07.030> so<00:05:07.300> I<00:05:07.330> think<00:05:07.569> it's<00:05:07.810> work

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:07.960 
thoughts on this so I think it's work

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:11.430 
thoughts on this so I think it's work
will<00:05:08.530> I<00:05:08.770> will<00:05:09.099> do<00:05:09.280> a<00:05:09.310> full<00:05:09.669> roundup<00:05:10.210> of<00:05:10.330> all<00:05:11.080> the

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:11.440 
will I will do a full roundup of all the

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:13.350 
will I will do a full roundup of all the
products<00:05:11.800> I've<00:05:11.889> been<00:05:12.130> trying<00:05:12.430> in<00:05:12.669> this<00:05:12.849> series
