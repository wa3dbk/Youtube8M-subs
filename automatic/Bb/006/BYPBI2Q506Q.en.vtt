welcome back trampolining segment to say

00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:15.039 
welcome back trampolining segment to say
we've<00:00:13.639> learned<00:00:13.879> and<00:00:14.150> establish<00:00:14.629> how<00:00:14.750> to<00:00:14.809> do

00:00:15.039 --> 00:00:15.049 
we've learned and establish how to do

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:16.600 
we've learned and establish how to do
the<00:00:15.170> balance<00:00:15.530> we<00:00:15.679> press<00:00:15.980> with<00:00:16.219> the<00:00:16.309> toes<00:00:16.580> and

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:16.610 
the balance we press with the toes and

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:19.410 
the balance we press with the toes and
the<00:00:17.180> Cavs<00:00:17.810> we're<00:00:18.230> building<00:00:18.529> our<00:00:18.650> calf<00:00:18.890> muscles

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:19.420 
the Cavs we're building our calf muscles

every<00:00:20.420> cell<00:00:20.810> in<00:00:21.050> your<00:00:21.080> body<00:00:21.259> responds<00:00:22.250> to

00:00:22.929 --> 00:00:22.939 
every cell in your body responds to

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:25.359 
every cell in your body responds to
rebound<00:00:23.390> exercise<00:00:23.990> for<00:00:24.260> this<00:00:24.439> reason<00:00:24.680> when

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:25.369 
rebound exercise for this reason when

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:27.550 
rebound exercise for this reason when
you<00:00:25.460> jump<00:00:25.760> up<00:00:25.970> and<00:00:26.180> launch<00:00:26.390> yourself<00:00:26.630> you're

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:27.560 
you jump up and launch yourself you're

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:29.920 
you jump up and launch yourself you're
putting<00:00:27.830> about<00:00:28.070> 2<00:00:28.369> g's<00:00:28.400> on<00:00:29.000> every<00:00:29.539> cell<00:00:29.810> in

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:29.930 
putting about 2 g's on every cell in

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:32.560 
putting about 2 g's on every cell in
your<00:00:29.960> body<00:00:30.080> is<00:00:30.980> feeling<00:00:31.340> that<00:00:31.640> that

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:32.570 
your body is feeling that that

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:34.840 
your body is feeling that that
gravitational<00:00:33.580> resistance<00:00:34.580> so<00:00:34.699> you're

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:34.850 
gravitational resistance so you're

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:37.560 
gravitational resistance so you're
pulling<00:00:35.210> about<00:00:35.300> 2<00:00:35.600> g's<00:00:35.629> going<00:00:36.230> up<00:00:36.350> for<00:00:37.070> one

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:37.570 
pulling about 2 g's going up for one

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:40.420 
pulling about 2 g's going up for one
instantaneous<00:00:38.570> tenth<00:00:39.470> of<00:00:39.589> a<00:00:39.710> second<00:00:40.159> you<00:00:40.280> are

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:40.430 
instantaneous tenth of a second you are

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:43.000 
instantaneous tenth of a second you are
completely<00:00:40.909> weightless<00:00:41.500> and<00:00:42.500> then<00:00:42.650> coming

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:43.010 
completely weightless and then coming

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:45.549 
completely weightless and then coming
down<00:00:43.040> you're<00:00:43.580> about<00:00:43.790> a<00:00:43.850> negative<00:00:44.390> 2<00:00:44.600> g's<00:00:44.900> when

00:00:45.549 --> 00:00:45.559 
down you're about a negative 2 g's when

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:47.140 
down you're about a negative 2 g's when
you<00:00:45.650> hit<00:00:45.830> that<00:00:45.979> Tramp<00:00:46.370> you<00:00:46.489> go<00:00:46.760> from<00:00:46.970> negative

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:47.150 
you hit that Tramp you go from negative

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:50.289 
you hit that Tramp you go from negative
2<00:00:47.629> to<00:00:47.659> positive<00:00:48.440> 2<00:00:48.830> g's<00:00:49.280> just<00:00:49.309> like<00:00:49.760> that<00:00:50.000> damn

00:00:50.289 --> 00:00:50.299 
2 to positive 2 g's just like that damn

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:53.289 
2 to positive 2 g's just like that damn
so<00:00:51.080> every<00:00:51.530> cell<00:00:51.860> in<00:00:52.010> your<00:00:52.040> body<00:00:52.190> responds<00:00:53.089> to

00:00:53.289 --> 00:00:53.299 
so every cell in your body responds to

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:55.649 
so every cell in your body responds to
react<00:00:53.600> to<00:00:53.629> that<00:00:53.839> every<00:00:54.589> muscle<00:00:54.860> in<00:00:55.159> your<00:00:55.220> body

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:55.659 
react to that every muscle in your body

00:00:55.659 --> 00:00:58.479 
react to that every muscle in your body
we<00:00:56.659> actually<00:00:56.930> responds<00:00:57.559> to<00:00:57.830> this<00:00:57.949> rebound

00:00:58.479 --> 00:00:58.489 
we actually responds to this rebound

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:00.850 
we actually responds to this rebound
exercise<00:00:59.180> learn<00:00:59.900> the<00:01:00.110> importance<00:01:00.619> of<00:01:00.710> it

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:00.860 
exercise learn the importance of it

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:04.750 
exercise learn the importance of it
study<00:01:01.159> up<00:01:01.369> Irish<00:01:01.790> I<00:01:02.559> mean<00:01:03.559> I<00:01:03.769> can't<00:01:04.489> think<00:01:04.580> of<00:01:04.670> a

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:04.760 
study up Irish I mean I can't think of a

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:07.719 
study up Irish I mean I can't think of a
single<00:01:04.790> other<00:01:05.510> exercise<00:01:06.110> the<00:01:06.830> impacts<00:01:07.430> and

00:01:07.719 --> 00:01:07.729 
single other exercise the impacts and

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:09.429 
single other exercise the impacts and
affects<00:01:08.090> every<00:01:08.420> cell<00:01:08.659> in<00:01:08.810> the<00:01:08.840> individual

00:01:09.429 --> 00:01:09.439 
affects every cell in the individual

00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:11.289 
affects every cell in the individual
selling<00:01:09.770> your<00:01:09.890> body<00:01:09.979> like<00:01:10.310> rebound<00:01:10.700> exercise

00:01:11.289 --> 00:01:11.299 
selling your body like rebound exercise

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:13.540 
selling your body like rebound exercise
so<00:01:11.960> we<00:01:12.110> establish<00:01:12.560> to<00:01:12.740> jump<00:01:13.040> now<00:01:13.220> we<00:01:13.280> know

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:13.550 
so we establish to jump now we know

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:15.760 
so we establish to jump now we know
we're<00:01:13.730> doing<00:01:13.880> our<00:01:14.090> body<00:01:14.300> is<00:01:14.480> good<00:01:14.690> we<00:01:15.410> keep<00:01:15.620> our

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:15.770 
we're doing our body is good we keep our

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:19.120 
we're doing our body is good we keep our
water<00:01:15.980> handy<00:01:17.200> whatever<00:01:18.200> we<00:01:18.410> do<00:01:18.590> we<00:01:18.770> keep<00:01:18.950> my

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:19.130 
water handy whatever we do we keep my

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:20.680 
water handy whatever we do we keep my
water<00:01:19.370> handy<00:01:19.880> hopefully<00:01:20.240> we're<00:01:20.390> in<00:01:20.510> that

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:20.690 
water handy hopefully we're in that

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:23.200 
water handy hopefully we're in that
water<00:01:20.930> have<00:01:21.350> it<00:01:21.560> I<00:01:21.710> got<00:01:22.280> check<00:01:22.490> for<00:01:22.700> bugs<00:01:22.880> make

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:23.210 
water have it I got check for bugs make

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:28.860 
water have it I got check for bugs make
sure<00:01:23.360> a<00:01:23.390> bug<00:01:23.690> has<00:01:23.900> it<00:01:24.080> went<00:01:24.230> into<00:01:24.320> my<00:01:24.500> drink

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:28.870 

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:31.690 

okay<00:01:29.870> from<00:01:30.050> here<00:01:30.320> we've<00:01:30.920> established<00:01:31.130> the

balance okay we got our hands working

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.090 
balance okay we got our hands working
now<00:01:36.170> we're<00:01:36.320> going<00:01:36.440> to<00:01:36.500> learn<00:01:36.620> something

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:37.100 
now we're going to learn something

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:39.760 
now we're going to learn something
simple<00:01:37.520> call<00:01:37.760> the<00:01:37.909> seat<00:01:38.180> drop<00:01:38.480> see<00:01:39.320> drop<00:01:39.620> I'll

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:53.330 
down I pop the mat with the hands I

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:56.290 
down I pop the mat with the hands I
literally<00:01:53.990> push<00:01:54.350> myself<00:01:54.590> up<00:01:55.070> and<00:01:55.520> I<00:01:55.909> use<00:01:56.090> my
