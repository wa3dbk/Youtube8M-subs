00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:15.780
First in flight.

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.770
Since the Wright brothers soared
over the dunes of Kitty Hawk,

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:21.890
North Carolina has been
an aviation leader.

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:23.770
Today, there's no better
place in the state

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:26.660
to prepare you for a
challenging career in aviation

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:30.710
than at the TH Davis
GTCC Aviation Center.

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:34.290
We're looking for students who
are motivated, who are focused,

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.540
and who are ready to jump into
this next phase of their lives.

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:38.370
I love [INAUDIBLE].

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.524
I always did when I
was in the military.

00:00:40.524 --> 00:00:42.815
So when I came here and
decided to get the AMP license,

00:00:42.815 --> 00:00:44.354
it was right up my alley.

00:00:44.354 --> 00:00:46.420
I would love to be able
to work for HondaJet

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:48.749
and be able to work on
their brand new aircraft.

00:00:48.749 --> 00:00:50.665
I think that would be a
wonderful opportunity.

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:58.690
GTCC's aviation program
puts you in the right place

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:01.440
at the right time with the
right equipment and curriculum,

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.840
including aviation electronics
or avionics, aviation systems

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:09.415
technology, aviation management
and career pilot technology.

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:16.190
I wanted to be a pilot
since I was 12 years of age.

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:18.590
I wouldn't go anywhere else,
because it's all here right

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:19.730
here at GTCC.

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:22.180
I can't ask for a better
set of instructors here.

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:24.770
I try to work with
them as much as I can,

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:27.480
give them as much practical
experience as well as theory.

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:30.560
Experience with the Royal
Air Force, Delta Airlines,

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.530
and TIMCO Aviation helps Tony
Turner bring a unique focus

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.090
to aviation students.

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.230
I can introduce
example scenarios

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:42.460
of areas of things
they make trip up on,

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:44.410
things to look out
for, things to do

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:45.960
and reinforce those areas.

00:01:57.314 --> 00:02:00.280
Whether you pursue our
two-year aviation technology

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:03.460
degree or an advanced degree
through out association

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:06.150
with Embry Riddle
Aeronautical University,

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:10.509
GTCC is the place in the
Piedmont triad to start.

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:12.860
Audrey Floyd users
her background

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:15.810
as an Air Force pilot,
commander, and instructor

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:19.260
to help guide GTCC
aviation students.

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.290
At GTCC, we've got
a great relationship

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:23.780
with local employers.

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:26.640
They work closely with us
on curriculum development,

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.450
providing work opportunities
for our students

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:34.040
while they're in training, and
providing work opportunities

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:36.000
after they graduate.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.910
Aviation-- a dynamic, growing
profession in the Piedmont

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:41.450
triad and globally.

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:43.800
Whether you want to fly
commercial airliners,

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:45.840
build them, or
keep them airborne,

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.930

to take to the sky.

We provide a lot of
hands-on training

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:02.140
to go alongside the
classroom training

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:04.240
that you get as
part of the degree.

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:06.270
The Piedmont triad
and the wider world

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:08.790
are rapidly and
constantly changing.

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:12.440
New skills are needed to meet
today's workforce demands.

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:15.390

program opens doors

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:17.610
