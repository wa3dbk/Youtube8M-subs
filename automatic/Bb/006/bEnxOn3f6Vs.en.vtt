00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
is lower quality and then you have to

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:46.639 
is lower quality and then you have to
hit<00:01:43.799> stop<00:01:44.159> so<00:01:44.579> you<00:01:44.670> could<00:01:45.259> flip<00:01:46.259> the<00:01:46.439> camera

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649

around and start using the back camera
so<00:01:49.950> now<00:01:50.520> I'm<00:01:50.640> using<00:01:50.790> the<00:01:50.939> back<00:01:51.090> camera<00:01:51.119> to

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
so now I'm using the back camera to

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.600 
so now I'm using the back camera to
shoot<00:01:51.689> video<00:01:51.990> so<00:01:52.320> kind<00:01:52.920> of<00:01:52.979> awkward<00:01:53.369> it

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
shoot video so kind of awkward it

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.520 
shoot video so kind of awkward it
results<00:01:54.000> in<00:01:54.090> an<00:01:54.210> awfully<00:01:54.600> long<00:01:54.750> break<00:01:55.229> between

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
results in an awfully long break between

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.510 
results in an awfully long break between
video<00:01:55.979> but<00:01:56.850> that<00:01:56.969> was<00:01:57.119> one<00:01:57.360> option<00:01:57.600> of<00:01:58.520> course

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
video but that was one option of course

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.550 
video but that was one option of course
this<00:02:00.119> is<00:02:00.420> option<00:02:00.780> number<00:02:00.869> two<00:02:01.200> where<00:02:01.439> I'm

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
this is option number two where I'm

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.350 
this is option number two where I'm
actually<00:02:01.740> holding<00:02:02.219> the<00:02:02.460> camera<00:02:02.729> or<00:02:03.329> the

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
actually holding the camera or the

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.959 
actually holding the camera or the
iPhone<00:02:04.009> backwards<00:02:05.009> so<00:02:05.399> right<00:02:05.670> now<00:02:05.759> I'm<00:02:05.850> using

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
iPhone backwards so right now I'm using

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:07.639 
iPhone backwards so right now I'm using
the<00:02:06.240> rear-facing<00:02:06.420> camera<00:02:07.079> but<00:02:07.229> I<00:02:07.259> can't<00:02:07.500> see

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
the rear-facing camera but I can't see

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:09.410 
the rear-facing camera but I can't see
the<00:02:07.770> screen<00:02:07.950> so<00:02:08.520> I<00:02:08.550> have<00:02:08.640> no<00:02:08.819> idea<00:02:09.119> whether

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
the screen so I have no idea whether

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.400 
the screen so I have no idea whether
like<00:02:09.690> my<00:02:09.869> hand<00:02:10.110> is<00:02:10.229> in<00:02:10.379> the<00:02:10.470> way<00:02:10.619> or<00:02:10.920> what<00:02:11.099> I'm

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:11.410 
like my hand is in the way or what I'm

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:13.500 
like my hand is in the way or what I'm
shooting<00:02:11.680> if<00:02:11.980> my<00:02:12.220> head<00:02:12.460> is<00:02:12.670> like<00:02:12.850> out<00:02:13.090> of<00:02:13.120> frame

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
shooting if my head is like out of frame

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:15.360 
shooting if my head is like out of frame
or<00:02:13.780> not<00:02:13.930> and<00:02:14.200> then<00:02:14.590> when<00:02:14.770> I<00:02:14.800> want<00:02:14.980> to<00:02:15.070> switch<00:02:15.340> to

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
or not and then when I want to switch to

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:16.770 
or not and then when I want to switch to
show<00:02:15.730> you<00:02:15.790> something<00:02:16.210> that's<00:02:16.360> going<00:02:16.510> on<00:02:16.630> in

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 
show you something that's going on in

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:18.450 
show you something that's going on in
front<00:02:16.930> of<00:02:17.080> me<00:02:17.170> I<00:02:17.320> have<00:02:17.680> to<00:02:17.800> grab<00:02:18.010> the<00:02:18.220> camera

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:18.460 
front of me I have to grab the camera

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:20.010 
front of me I have to grab the camera
and<00:02:18.610> flip<00:02:19.030> it<00:02:19.120> around<00:02:19.240> like<00:02:19.540> that

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:20.020 
and flip it around like that

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:21.960 
and flip it around like that
which<00:02:20.350> again<00:02:20.500> results<00:02:21.070> in<00:02:21.160> this<00:02:21.280> weird<00:02:21.640> kind

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
which again results in this weird kind

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:24.030 
which again results in this weird kind
of<00:02:22.180> you<00:02:22.570> know<00:02:22.690> whirling<00:02:23.170> motion<00:02:23.530> as<00:02:23.680> I<00:02:23.770> flip

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040 
of you know whirling motion as I flip

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:26.040 
of you know whirling motion as I flip
the<00:02:24.190> camera<00:02:24.400> around<00:02:24.580> well<00:02:25.360> there's<00:02:25.780> got<00:02:25.900> to<00:02:26.020> be

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:26.050 
the camera around well there's got to be

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:27.420 
the camera around well there's got to be
a<00:02:26.140> better<00:02:26.350> solution<00:02:26.590> right<00:02:27.130> and<00:02:27.310> that's

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
a better solution right and that's

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:29.700 
a better solution right and that's
exactly<00:02:27.550> what<00:02:28.030> to<00:02:28.270> cam<00:02:28.540> shoot<00:02:28.900> is<00:02:29.110> all<00:02:29.380> about

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:29.710 
exactly what to cam shoot is all about

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:32.730 
exactly what to cam shoot is all about
so<00:02:30.550> now<00:02:30.580> I'm<00:02:30.880> using<00:02:31.060> the<00:02:31.360> two<00:02:31.720> cam<00:02:31.990> shoot<00:02:32.500> app

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:32.740 
so now I'm using the two cam shoot app

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:34.650 
so now I'm using the two cam shoot app
and<00:02:33.100> the<00:02:33.280> great<00:02:33.490> thing<00:02:33.670> about<00:02:33.730> this<00:02:34.030> app<00:02:34.240> is<00:02:34.450> it

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:34.660 
and the great thing about this app is it

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:36.810 
and the great thing about this app is it
allows<00:02:34.870> you<00:02:35.140> to<00:02:35.290> almost<00:02:35.680> seamlessly<00:02:36.190> go<00:02:36.280> from

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:36.820 
allows you to almost seamlessly go from

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:38.970 
allows you to almost seamlessly go from
the<00:02:37.030> front<00:02:37.690> facing<00:02:37.930> camera<00:02:38.470> to<00:02:38.650> the<00:02:38.770> rear

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:38.980 
the front facing camera to the rear

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:41.430 
the front facing camera to the rear

that kind of annoying girl motion where

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:46.740 
that kind of annoying girl motion where
you<00:02:45.340> have<00:02:45.520> to<00:02:45.640> flip<00:02:45.850> the<00:02:46.000> camera<00:02:46.180> around<00:02:46.450> of

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750 
you have to flip the camera around of

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:49.140 
you have to flip the camera around of
course<00:02:46.780> it<00:02:47.140> also<00:02:47.290> allows<00:02:47.650> you<00:02:47.890> to<00:02:47.920> see<00:02:48.610> exactly
