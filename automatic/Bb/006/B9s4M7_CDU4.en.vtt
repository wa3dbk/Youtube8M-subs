00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:07.040
 good this video tutorial I 'm going to 

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:09.000
 teach how to finish compiling the most 

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:10.320
 holidays 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.059
 in the previous video I showed you how 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.530
 make your first simple and basic map and 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:17.240
 Today I'm going to finish teaching you how 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.240
 compile what to play it 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:21.910
 easily 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:24.279
 well we have to do is that is iron 

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:25.720
 in case the previous thing did not see it this 

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:28.149
 is the link so you can download them 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:31.109
 and here to download and while not 

00:00:28.149 --> 00:00:31.109
 they are going to download the desktop 

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:41.590
 a folder is created if in this case the 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:41.590
 download already know and honor 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:46.920
 they will not extract it if it is going to be created 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:48.929
 This file I told 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.579
 in this case this is the program that uses 

00:00:48.929 --> 00:00:52.800
 in the previous video with this with this and 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:55.949
 with this this is the pothole we are going to 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:58.850
 install yes and there is none in the 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:01.300
 folder that you want yes 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:04.790
 and in this case what creates a folder 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:08.560
 ghost because to be able to erase what 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:11.560
 installed expects to be finished 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:11.560
 install 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:23.679
 ok, this is going to start 

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:26.049
 configure what the first thing they have to 

00:01:23.679 --> 00:01:29.130
 do is come to specification and come 

00:01:26.049 --> 00:01:33.979
 to the fauna part 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.979
 let's make four options is 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:39.740
 and it 's fine because they are the different 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:42.020
 compilers that will use the 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:44.180
 program what we are going to do now is 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:46.070
 install the programs because that's the way 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:48.370
 no no it will not work but we are going to 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:52.170
 spinning options set up 

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:52.170
 and we are going to legs 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:02.800
 cc gy and we search 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:04.840
 the file that was downloaded that is the 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:06.640
 that would be the executable in which it would be 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:10.410
 to install in this case the time with 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:10.410
 desk the folder was 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:19.250
 in this folder 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:21.290
 and it's always easy because it always goes with 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:26.080
 the same name in which they have to 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:26.080
 look for the next one 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:30.490
 in the same folder and it's just going 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:36.030
 find the four inside 

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:36.030
 back and now we come to rado 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:43.530
 it's okay we accept nothing more 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:47.550
 we accept 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:49.610
 good if you are to use a texture in 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:52.110
 the dance use a texture that is not 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:54.900
 default of the counter for example the 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:56.819
 texture hard live point one is default 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:59.010
 so you do not have to be included 

00:02:56.819 --> 00:03:02.750
 inside the map bcp let's say 6 but 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:04.950
 for example the texture z htl is not a 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:06.360
 is a texture that is not included in 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:07.920
 the contract you see this one we are going to 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:10.650
 include inside the map that since 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:12.130
 has the null texture for example if it 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:14.980
 we include him 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:18.030
 well this is all set if 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:19.770
 they want what they can do is file 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:22.100
 we keep and we keep the 

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:26.030
 configuration we put name with 

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:26.030
 paint action any name 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:28.590
 yes 

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:35.000
 ready, what we have is already set 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:37.790
 what to do now is let's compile what 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.930
 to compile as soon as we have 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:41.530
 done we are going to look for the map that 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:41.530
 we had done 

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:49.330
 that the choto map 

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:52.460
 and this was our map 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:57.790
 what we do is file export to 

00:03:55.299 --> 00:03:59.650
 point more and we're going to save those 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:01.170
 we're going to tackle it in the folder 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:05.260
 that we are preparing everything 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:08.080
 put save and close the valve does 

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:11.170
 missing we go the bach and we look for to take with 

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:14.040
 this button in the dot file more than 

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:14.040
 we had already left in 

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:22.470
 and we put compile rom 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:25.940
 to compile 

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:30.890
 good 

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:36.460
 Now let's find the program we will 

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:39.060
 what we do is look for the bcp that 

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:39.060
 I was 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:46.640
 it throws me an error 

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:46.640
 do not 

00:04:47.129 --> 00:04:51.809
 and we go to the good folder the folder is 

00:04:50.039 --> 00:04:54.149
 that strike that we have session 

00:04:51.809 --> 00:04:56.929
 of shortcuts to carta maps and 

00:04:54.149 --> 00:04:58.889
 let's have the map meet work 

00:04:56.929 --> 00:05:01.050
 paste 

00:04:58.889 --> 00:05:04.069
 to spend our map what we do 

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:04.069
 now it's going to count 

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:11.310
 let's go to our map 

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:23.990
 such 

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:26.210
 and here is on our map 

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:27.919
 with 12 cloth 

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:31.190
 as you can see the lights are so 

00:05:27.919 --> 00:05:35.169
 glued to the ceiling that looks at the 

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:37.689
 five water points but 

00:05:35.169 --> 00:05:38.949
 if we go away, we have 

00:05:37.689 --> 00:05:40.990
 you do not notice if there is or 

00:05:38.949 --> 00:05:42.930
 We can put some kind of 

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:45.260
 light there so that there is much more 

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:48.260
 detailed 

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:49.310
 but hey this is going to be his first map 

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:51.050
 I hope you enjoy later I will 

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:53.360
 teach him how to make more more boxes with 

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:54.920
 best ways ramps stairs and 

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:56.450
 different things but as long as you enjoy 

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:57.890
 then go try always try 

00:05:56.450 --> 00:06:00.409
 yourselves if there is nothing better than 

00:05:57.890 --> 00:06:02.599
 yourselves testing 

00:06:00.409 --> 00:06:04.069
 I leave the facebook page as 

00:06:02.599 --> 00:06:05.550
 always if any query can 

00:06:04.069 --> 00:06:07.470
 be doing 

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:10.160
 I hope you have served them well 

00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:10.160
 see you later
