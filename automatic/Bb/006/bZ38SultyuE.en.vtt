 resigns from his office as 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.850
 defense minister are to blame 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.500
 the professors design doctoral thesis 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.480
 we have tested them 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.519
 let go and that 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.990
 Professor and director open it 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:32.969
 the barricades go are to the times 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.870
 keep your mouth shut small design 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.850
 very small 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.520
 because everything must on I stuck've 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:41.790
 now a survey belongs to 57 percent of 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:43.559
 China's commission and daughter all have 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.360
 they are usually written off today 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.730
 with the abdanken von guttenberg would have 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.120
 Immediately Frau Merkel packing her things 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.940
 have to 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:54.539
 both would have said and what we have now 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:56.579
 have up that is the last last 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:01:00.350
 Dirt on companies in the Bundestag like 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.350
 would it be with the Klaus as a successor 

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:07.710
 that is not so serious and me 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.060
 have my doctorate and so on and 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.720
 I feel now also try one 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.170
 doktortitel 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:15.299
 I want to get over it too we are over 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:19.460
 but articles about garden architecture 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:25.229
 would birds and even birds 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:27.170
 architecture birds do not have that 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:30.150
 birds are not understood now 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:31.979
 next topic a 79-year-old retiree 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:34.130
 dies during sex with one 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.130
 prostitutes 

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:40.049
 basically you should if such a man 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:42.479
 you should first go to a doctor 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:44.850
 attest but he should practically a 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:46.920
 pacemaker if he has that is still 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.689
 or something he should first 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.310
 to show the note and then he should 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:51.479
 down to business 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:53.070
 once that is automatically am 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:54.930
 pacemaker and I have against 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.939
 puff I'm so excited and so 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.890
 further then the browser jumps 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:00.810
 then you would go there the claus sometimes 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.930
 he should not send yes yes 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.930
 Not 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.950
 but not that the same thing happens to him 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:16.959
 if it's that bad but the other side 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:18.879
 if I ever got there 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:20.709
 I would go into puff now and im 

00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:24.280
 Puff we die that's it 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:25.840
 a great thing but m5 die ingrid 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:27.670
 will report that the case 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:30.430
 then she will be sitting here alone 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:31.739
 and to say that my dear god I 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:36.280
 must tell you 

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:39.220
 My husband is at the pasha in the puff 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:42.180
 I die terribly sorry 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:44.650
 Nice conclusion until next week 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:46.599
 are that you may not want to leave 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:48.370
 you can not cope with that anymore 

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:50.980
 Basically, we took it hard 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:53.799
 our borders must close like 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:56.019
 because our border, the lines, the 

00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:57.730
 subtract Bundeswehr from Afghanistan and 

00:02:56.019 --> 00:02:59.950
 the border is wondering with the 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:01.780
 Bundeswehr soldiers with the 5000 people 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:03.730
 and you should also hit the punch again 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:07.530
 reintroduce it until the wall is about 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:07.530
 we do not have that much cement
