to<00:00:30.390> use<00:00:30.419> and<00:00:30.839> maintain<00:00:31.259> so<00:00:32.070> let's<00:00:32.250> look<00:00:32.460> at<00:00:32.610> the

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
to use and maintain so let's look at the

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.370 
to use and maintain so let's look at the
different<00:00:33.030> parts<00:00:33.270> of<00:00:33.360> the<00:00:33.480> system<00:00:33.660> and<00:00:34.020> learn

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
different parts of the system and learn

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.290 
different parts of the system and learn
how<00:00:34.590> to<00:00:34.620> clean<00:00:34.890> the<00:00:35.040> filters<00:00:35.400> assemble<00:00:36.210> the

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
how to clean the filters assemble the

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.010 
how to clean the filters assemble the
unit<00:00:36.600> and<00:00:36.690> filter<00:00:37.170> some<00:00:37.380> water<00:00:38.450> laid<00:00:39.450> out<00:00:39.690> here

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
unit and filter some water laid out here

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.990 
unit and filter some water laid out here
are<00:00:40.260> the<00:00:40.380> different<00:00:40.740> parts<00:00:40.980> of<00:00:41.190> the<00:00:41.340> system<00:00:41.580> so

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
are the different parts of the system so

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.110 
are the different parts of the system so
they<00:00:42.150> can<00:00:42.330> be<00:00:42.450> easily<00:00:42.480> seen<00:00:43.940> starting<00:00:44.940> at<00:00:45.030> the

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
they can be easily seen starting at the

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.020 
they can be easily seen starting at the
top<00:00:45.330> of<00:00:45.540> the<00:00:45.600> unit<00:00:45.900> we<00:00:46.050> have<00:00:46.260> the<00:00:46.290> lid<00:00:47.030> this

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.459 
water level in the lower chamber now
we've<00:01:54.240> looked<00:01:54.479> at<00:01:54.600> the<00:01:54.689> different<00:01:55.049> parts<00:01:55.350> of

00:01:55.459 --> 00:01:55.469 
we've looked at the different parts of

00:01:55.469 --> 00:01:57.649 
we've looked at the different parts of
the<00:01:55.619> unit<00:01:55.950> let's<00:01:56.459> talk<00:01:56.789> about<00:01:56.969> cleaning<00:01:57.479> the

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
the unit let's talk about cleaning the

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:01.340 
the unit let's talk about cleaning the
filters<00:01:58.490> ok<00:01:59.490> so<00:01:59.549> this<00:01:59.850> is<00:02:00.029> one<00:02:00.270> of<00:02:00.359> the<00:02:00.479> filters

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
filters ok so this is one of the filters
