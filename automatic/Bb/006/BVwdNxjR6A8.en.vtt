00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.510
 Hmm 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:30.800
 we now present in our world two 

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:34.550
 brazilian enduro x2014 wheels with 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:37.220
 its first of three stages played in 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:41.530
 itaipava petrÃ³polis in the beautiful region 

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:41.530
 river of the state of rio de janeiro 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:44.620
 liked 

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:50.770
 the mode enduro montain bike 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:54.190
 definitely come to stay and already 

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:56.440
 shows its own strength and identity 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:58.470
 in this second year of 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:58.470
 Brazil 

00:01:18.069 --> 00:01:31.609
 the first year of brazil enduro sirkis 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:34.149
 I was very happy and got the 

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:37.429
 enduro mode in brazil along with 

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:38.329
 other countries in the modality began to 

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:41.899
 to bomb 

00:01:38.329 --> 00:01:44.539
 effectively for two years, which helps 

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:47.090
 to level the athletes who will participate in 

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:49.179
 Brazil movies to athletes from outside the 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:49.179
 parents 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.710
 O 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:01.119
 the itaipava stage will be the beginning of 

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:03.340
 all 

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:05.500
 then so we our idea is to have 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:07.810
 a softer bridge including the 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:11.170
 other steps our intention here is 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:13.540
 show how you do it is show them how they are 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:16.000
 rules is to apply an event that is 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:17.200
 easier with internship also a little 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.489
 more easy 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:20.680
 so we're trying to do everything 

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:23.769
 to make everyone adapts and 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:27.540
 people will be able to adapt there is 

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:27.540
 Brazilian culture within the enduro 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:40.610
 the hard is very important that the scenario 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:42.500
 because in my view it's the 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:44.540
 the most democratic form of 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:47.150
 mountain bike competition and there that 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:48.980
 more has to do with the essence of Bahia is 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:52.069
 an easy mode is a mode 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:54.200
 that you are very independent that you 

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:56.359
 if it turns you do not have to have a car 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:58.670
 rescue a person to rescue a 

00:02:56.359 --> 00:03:00.739
 track is super cool and prepared for you 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:02.859
 have a powerful you walk 

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:05.810
 if you have a cross-country course 

00:03:02.859 --> 00:03:07.849
 super prepared for you to walk only do 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:10.299
 force and not have fun on the plane in 

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:10.299
 came down 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:19.650
 I think this moment of the enduro montain 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:22.980
 Brazilian bike is very important 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:25.200
 why is it even the military enduro? 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:27.209
 at the beginning more professional and 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:29.400
 Brazil has already followed this trend with 

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:31.260
 major brands thus investing the event 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:33.180
 creating team 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:35.400
 I think we are strengthening in the 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:37.349
 moment in brazil and it will be the 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:38.939
 the first mode of mountain biking to 

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:41.310
 people will not be so late in 

00:03:38.939 --> 00:03:43.170
 relation to the rest of the world and I 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:44.909
 We will do well in the future with several 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:47.790
 athletes being able to race in 

00:03:44.909 --> 00:03:51.680
 enduro and show the potential of 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:51.680
 mountains that Brazil has size
