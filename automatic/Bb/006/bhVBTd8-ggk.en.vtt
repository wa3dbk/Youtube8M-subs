hardened<00:01:51.200> I<00:01:51.500> thought<00:01:51.770> a<00:01:52.040> fluke<00:01:52.880> 87<00:01:53.600> which

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:53.810 
hardened I thought a fluke 87 which

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:55.540 
hardened I thought a fluke 87 which
could<00:01:53.990> have<00:01:54.080> been<00:01:54.140> 888<00:01:54.860> and<00:01:55.100> I<00:01:55.190> think<00:01:55.400> the

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:55.550 
could have been 888 and I think the

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:57.550 
could have been 888 and I think the
