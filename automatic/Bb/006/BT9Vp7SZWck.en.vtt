00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.929 
the jimping on the top is excellent the
way<00:02:00.600> the<00:02:00.840> handle<00:02:01.469> is<00:02:01.619> shaped<00:02:01.920> you<00:02:02.399> can<00:02:02.549> really

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
way the handle is shaped you can really

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:04.520 
way the handle is shaped you can really
get<00:02:03.090> a<00:02:03.149> grip<00:02:03.329> on<00:02:03.479> it<00:02:03.540> and<00:02:03.689> that<00:02:04.020> the<00:02:04.229> trigger

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
get a grip on it and that the trigger

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.960 
get a grip on it and that the trigger
just<00:02:05.130> really<00:02:05.610> locks<00:02:05.820> your<00:02:06.030> hand<00:02:06.210> in<00:02:06.360> there

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:07.970 
just really locks your hand in there

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:11.449 
just really locks your hand in there
decoding<00:02:08.970> I<00:02:09.119> believe<00:02:10.050> it's<00:02:10.319> a<00:02:10.470> titanium

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
decoding I believe it's a titanium

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.940 
decoding I believe it's a titanium
nitride<00:02:12.150> nickel<00:02:12.510> I'm<00:02:12.840> not<00:02:12.989> sure<00:02:13.140> but

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
nitride nickel I'm not sure but

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.070 
nitride nickel I'm not sure but
not<00:02:14.400> sure<00:02:14.610> I<00:02:14.790> believe<00:02:14.880> it<00:02:15.210> is<00:02:15.300> it<00:02:15.540> does<00:02:15.870> have<00:02:16.050> a

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
not sure I believe it is it does have a

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:17.420 
not sure I believe it is it does have a
little<00:02:16.290> bit<00:02:16.380> of<00:02:16.470> scuffing<00:02:16.830> on<00:02:16.950> it<00:02:17.069> for<00:02:17.280> me

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
little bit of scuffing on it for me

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:19.160 
little bit of scuffing on it for me
opening<00:02:17.940> some<00:02:18.120> plastic<00:02:18.510> stuff<00:02:18.690> but<00:02:18.930> I'm<00:02:19.020> sure

thumb stud OOP my bed sorry you can use

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:34.760 
thumb stud OOP my bed sorry you can use
thumb<00:02:31.230> stud<00:02:31.470> and<00:02:31.650> open<00:02:31.860> it<00:02:31.950> up<00:02:32.660> it<00:02:33.660> is<00:02:33.959> all<00:02:34.290> hex

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:34.770 
thumb stud and open it up it is all hex

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:36.949 
thumb stud and open it up it is all hex
bits<00:02:35.040> so<00:02:35.580> you<00:02:35.790> need<00:02:35.970> to<00:02:36.060> do<00:02:36.420> any<00:02:36.540> work<00:02:36.630> on<00:02:36.900> it

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:36.959 
bits so you need to do any work on it

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:40.010 
bits so you need to do any work on it
you<00:02:37.140> can<00:02:37.260> do<00:02:37.350> that<00:02:37.580> and<00:02:38.580> it<00:02:38.850> is<00:02:38.880> steel<00:02:39.750> lined

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:40.020 
you can do that and it is steel lined

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:42.110 
you can do that and it is steel lined
it's<00:02:40.350> not<00:02:40.560> really<00:02:40.980> skeletonized<00:02:41.670> but<00:02:41.910> if<00:02:42.000> you

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
it's not really skeletonized but if you

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:43.699 
it's not really skeletonized but if you
look<00:02:42.330> in<00:02:42.480> there<00:02:42.630> it's<00:02:42.959> kind<00:02:43.110> of<00:02:43.170> dirty<00:02:43.319> up<00:02:43.530> and

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:43.709 
look in there it's kind of dirty up and

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:44.930 
look in there it's kind of dirty up and
using<00:02:44.040> this<00:02:44.100> one<00:02:44.220> a<00:02:44.280> lot<00:02:44.430> but<00:02:44.550> if<00:02:44.640> you<00:02:44.730> look<00:02:44.850> in

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
using this one a lot but if you look in

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:47.030 
using this one a lot but if you look in
there<00:02:45.060> there's<00:02:45.480> a<00:02:45.540> big<00:02:45.810> cutout<00:02:46.470> on<00:02:46.500> the<00:02:46.709> inside

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
there there's a big cutout on the inside

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.370 
there there's a big cutout on the inside
so<00:02:47.250> I<00:02:47.280> guess<00:02:47.520> they<00:02:47.750> skeletonized<00:02:48.750> it<00:02:48.930> a<00:02:49.140> little

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.380 
so I guess they skeletonized it a little

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:53.840 
so I guess they skeletonized it a little
bit<00:02:49.560> not<00:02:50.459> quite<00:02:50.489> sure<00:02:50.910> um<00:02:52.519> trying<00:02:53.519> to<00:02:53.610> think

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:53.850 
bit not quite sure um trying to think

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:56.600 
bit not quite sure um trying to think
this<00:02:54.090> is<00:02:54.300> serial<00:02:54.870> number<00:02:55.110> twelve<00:02:55.459> just<00:02:56.459> kind

this is serial number twelve just kind

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:58.130 
this is serial number twelve just kind
of<00:02:56.670> cool<00:02:56.820> I<00:02:57.030> guess<00:02:57.360> I<00:02:57.480> got<00:02:57.600> it<00:02:57.720> right<00:02:57.840> at<00:02:58.050> the

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
of cool I guess I got it right at the

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:59.810 
of cool I guess I got it right at the
beginning<00:02:58.200> of<00:02:58.560> the<00:02:58.620> run<00:02:58.769> and<00:02:59.280> if<00:02:59.370> you<00:02:59.489> can<00:02:59.640> see

00:02:59.810 --> 00:02:59.820 
beginning of the run and if you can see

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:01.729 
beginning of the run and if you can see
that<00:03:00.000> it's<00:03:00.390> gonna<00:03:00.480> be<00:03:00.630> backwards<00:03:01.110> but<00:03:01.320> it's

00:03:01.729 --> 00:03:01.739 
that it's gonna be backwards but it's

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:04.690 
that it's gonna be backwards but it's
serial<00:03:02.130> number<00:03:02.310> zero<00:03:02.550> zero<00:03:02.790> one<00:03:02.970> two
