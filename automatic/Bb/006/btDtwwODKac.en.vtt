00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:45.090 
race like that but you know the next one
I'm<00:00:43.750> hoping<00:00:44.110> that<00:00:44.290> we<00:00:44.380> can<00:00:44.500> start<00:00:44.710> the<00:00:44.860> front

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:45.100 
I'm hoping that we can start the front

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:46.889 
I'm hoping that we can start the front
and<00:00:45.280> win<00:00:45.910> from<00:00:46.120> there<00:00:46.329> because<00:00:46.570> it's<00:00:46.719> a<00:00:46.750> lot

00:00:46.889 --> 00:00:46.899 
and win from there because it's a lot

00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:52.020 
and win from there because it's a lot
easier<00:00:46.930> that<00:00:47.379> way<00:00:50.640> there's<00:00:51.640> so<00:00:51.730> much<00:00:51.850> history

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:52.030 
easier that way there's so much history

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:55.830 
easier that way there's so much history
in<00:00:53.100> Monza<00:00:54.100> but<00:00:54.700> also<00:00:54.850> the<00:00:55.059> de<00:00:55.180> fuzzy<00:00:55.420> you<00:00:55.719> know

on<00:01:02.440> the<00:01:02.500> calendar<00:01:03.010> there's<00:01:03.219> just<00:01:03.370> no<00:01:03.550> other

00:01:03.569 --> 00:01:03.579 
on the calendar there's just no other

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:06.810 
on the calendar there's just no other
configuration<00:01:04.479> like<00:01:04.509> Monza<00:01:05.259> it's<00:01:05.979> is<00:01:06.369> very

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:06.820 
configuration like Monza it's is very

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:09.450 
configuration like Monza it's is very
very<00:01:07.000> unique<00:01:07.780> a<00:01:07.960> bit<00:01:08.140> like<00:01:08.289> a<00:01:08.320> kind<00:01:08.860> of<00:01:08.950> a<00:01:09.070> shoe

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:09.460 
very unique a bit like a kind of a shoe

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:12.120 
very unique a bit like a kind of a shoe
design<00:01:09.820> massively<00:01:10.509> massively<00:01:10.750> fast<00:01:11.259> low

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:12.130 
design massively massively fast low

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:15.000 
design massively massively fast low
downforce<00:01:12.420> it<00:01:13.420> creates<00:01:14.080> great<00:01:14.320> racing<00:01:14.740> it

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:15.010

always<00:01:15.729> has<00:01:15.880> for<00:01:16.060> many<00:01:16.119> years<00:01:16.240> and<00:01:16.570> it<00:01:17.049> is<00:01:17.170> one

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:17.290 
always has for many years and it is one

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:18.750 
always has for many years and it is one
of<00:01:17.320> those<00:01:17.500> historic<00:01:17.920> circuits<00:01:18.310> that<00:01:18.369> I've<00:01:18.580> not

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:18.760 
of those historic circuits that I've not

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:20.910 
of those historic circuits that I've not
won<00:01:18.909> on<00:01:19.030> so<00:01:19.270> it's<00:01:19.420> for<00:01:20.260> me<00:01:20.380> that's<00:01:20.590> what<00:01:20.710> makes

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:20.920 
won on so it's for me that's what makes

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:23.760 
won on so it's for me that's what makes
it<00:01:21.040> extra<00:01:21.400> special<00:01:21.490> and<00:01:22.350> you<00:01:23.350> know<00:01:23.470> I<00:01:23.500> haven't

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:23.770 
it extra special and you know I haven't

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:25.370 
it extra special and you know I haven't
won<00:01:23.979> here<00:01:24.189> yet<00:01:24.400> I'm<00:01:24.640> hoping<00:01:24.820> that<00:01:25.000> we<00:01:25.180> can

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
won here yet I'm hoping that we can

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:35.350 
won here yet I'm hoping that we can
change<00:01:26.380> that<00:01:26.590> this<00:01:26.740> weekend

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:35.360 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:37.540 

it<00:01:35.810> feels<00:01:36.140> much<00:01:36.380> faster<00:01:36.410> just<00:01:37.040> you<00:01:37.220> don't<00:01:37.310> you

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:37.550 
it feels much faster just you don't you

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:38.950 
it feels much faster just you don't you
have<00:01:37.670> a<00:01:37.700> lot<00:01:37.880> less<00:01:38.030> drag<00:01:38.300> you<00:01:38.480> have<00:01:38.570> a<00:01:38.660> lot<00:01:38.810> less

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:38.960 
have a lot less drag you have a lot less

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:41.890 
have a lot less drag you have a lot less
downforce<00:01:39.170> so<00:01:40.070> the<00:01:40.160> car<00:01:40.370> is<00:01:40.400> it<00:01:40.820> some<00:01:41.210> it

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:41.900 
downforce so the car is it some it

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:44.350 
downforce so the car is it some it
reaches<00:01:42.290> top<00:01:42.470> end<00:01:42.710> much<00:01:43.370> much<00:01:43.580> quicker<00:01:43.730> but

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:44.360 
reaches top end much much quicker but

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:45.340 
reaches top end much much quicker but
you're<00:01:44.480> on<00:01:44.570> the<00:01:44.600> straight<00:01:44.900> was<00:01:45.080> so<00:01:45.200> much

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:45.350 
you're on the straight was so much

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:47.410 
you're on the straight was so much
longer<00:01:45.740> and<00:01:45.890> you're<00:01:46.340> flat<00:01:46.610> out<00:01:46.640> for<00:01:47.000> so<00:01:47.210> long

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:47.420 
longer and you're flat out for so long

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:49.480 
longer and you're flat out for so long
and<00:01:47.720> picking<00:01:48.620> breaking<00:01:48.950> points<00:01:49.250> is<00:01:49.340> much

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:49.490 
and picking breaking points is much

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:51.790 
and picking breaking points is much
harder<00:01:49.730> when<00:01:50.480> the<00:01:50.810> faster<00:01:51.080> you<00:01:51.320> go<00:01:51.380> the<00:01:51.410> harder

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:51.800 
harder when the faster you go the harder

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:53.380 
harder when the faster you go the harder
it<00:01:52.010> is<00:01:52.070> to<00:01:52.280> pick<00:01:52.430> the<00:01:52.460> right<00:01:52.550> breaking<00:01:52.970> points

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:53.390 
it is to pick the right breaking points

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:55.240 
it is to pick the right breaking points
the<00:01:53.630> cut<00:01:53.810> is<00:01:53.840> moving<00:01:54.229> around<00:01:54.380> a<00:01:54.560> lot<00:01:54.650> more<00:01:54.920> as

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:55.250 
the cut is moving around a lot more as

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:57.010 
the cut is moving around a lot more as
you<00:01:55.670> know<00:01:55.760> sliding<00:01:56.180> across<00:01:56.330> the<00:01:56.510> tarmac<00:01:56.690> more

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:57.020 
you know sliding across the tarmac more

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:59.200 
you know sliding across the tarmac more
than<00:01:57.140> we<00:01:57.260> used<00:01:57.440> to<00:01:57.560> but<00:01:58.550> the<00:01:58.670> cars<00:01:58.880> have<00:01:59.030> got<00:01:59.180> a

00:01:59.200 --> 00:01:59.210 
than we used to but the cars have got a

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:01.270 
than we used to but the cars have got a
lot<00:01:59.390> more<00:01:59.450> downforce<00:01:59.840> this<00:02:00.260> year<00:02:00.530> than<00:02:00.740> in<00:02:01.100> the

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:01.280 
lot more downforce this year than in the

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.000 
lot more downforce this year than in the
last<00:02:01.310> two<00:02:01.640> years<00:02:01.670> so<00:02:02.240> I<00:02:02.560> think<00:02:03.560> will<00:02:03.650> cope<00:02:03.860> with

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:04.010 
last two years so I think will cope with

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:06.969 
last two years so I think will cope with
it<00:02:04.660> you<00:02:05.660> know<00:02:05.690> you<00:02:05.990> don't<00:02:06.110> really<00:02:06.229> feel<00:02:06.650> the

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:06.979 
it you know you don't really feel the

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:08.410 
it you know you don't really feel the
speed<00:02:07.220> at<00:02:07.340> monza<00:02:07.640> until<00:02:07.910> you<00:02:08.030> hit<00:02:08.149> something

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:08.420 
speed at monza until you hit something

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:10.300 
speed at monza until you hit something
which<00:02:08.660> hopefully<00:02:08.869> we<00:02:09.170> want<00:02:09.320> to<00:02:09.380> do<00:02:09.440> this<00:02:09.560> is<00:02:09.770> so

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:10.310 
which hopefully we want to do this is so

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:12.400 
which hopefully we want to do this is so
throughout<00:02:10.580> a<00:02:10.640> race<00:02:10.910> you<00:02:11.900> won't<00:02:12.140> be<00:02:12.290> flying

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:12.410 
throughout a race you won't be flying

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:13.510 
throughout a race you won't be flying
every<00:02:12.770> lap<00:02:12.950> because<00:02:13.130> you've<00:02:13.280> been<00:02:13.370> looking

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:13.520 
every lap because you've been looking

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:14.979 
every lap because you've been looking
after<00:02:13.820> the<00:02:14.000> brakes<00:02:14.239> you're<00:02:14.570> looking<00:02:14.780> after

00:02:14.979 --> 00:02:14.989 
after the brakes you're looking after

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:17.380 
after the brakes you're looking after
the<00:02:15.080> engine<00:02:15.470> looking<00:02:16.040> after<00:02:16.130> the<00:02:16.310> tires<00:02:16.550> so

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:17.390 
the engine looking after the tires so

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:20.860 
the engine looking after the tires so
it's<00:02:18.260> a<00:02:18.350> very<00:02:18.380> interesting<00:02:18.650> race<00:02:19.220> and<00:02:19.550> is<00:02:20.209> one

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:20.870 
it's a very interesting race and is one

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:22.240 
it's a very interesting race and is one
of<00:02:20.959> those<00:02:21.020> races<00:02:21.320> really<00:02:21.470> does<00:02:21.620> deafen<00:02:22.070> you

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:22.250 
of those races really does deafen you

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:23.680 
of those races really does deafen you
because<00:02:22.580> you're<00:02:22.730> at<00:02:22.820> full<00:02:23.000> throttle<00:02:23.209> for<00:02:23.540> so

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:23.690 
because you're at full throttle for so

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:33.750 
because you're at full throttle for so
long

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:33.760 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:36.000 

strangely<00:02:34.689> Mons<00:02:34.900> is<00:02:35.080> a<00:02:35.140> very<00:02:35.379> difficult<00:02:35.620> place

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.010 
strangely Mons is a very difficult place

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:38.399 
strangely Mons is a very difficult place
to<00:02:36.040> pass<00:02:36.280> even<00:02:36.549> illustrates<00:02:37.030> so<00:02:37.239> long<00:02:37.450> so<00:02:37.810> I'm

00:02:38.399 --> 00:02:38.409 
to pass even illustrates so long so I'm

00:02:38.409 --> 00:02:41.160 
to pass even illustrates so long so I'm
happy<00:02:38.650> the<00:02:38.860> DRS<00:02:39.250> owns<00:02:39.489> a<00:02:39.730> pretty<00:02:40.269> big<00:02:40.450> I<00:02:40.659> think

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:41.170 
happy the DRS owns a pretty big I think

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:43.350 
happy the DRS owns a pretty big I think
it'll<00:02:41.349> make<00:02:41.439> some<00:02:41.739> good<00:02:41.860> racing<00:02:42.310> and<00:02:42.430> you<00:02:43.269> know

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:43.360 
it'll make some good racing and you know

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:44.789 
it'll make some good racing and you know
the<00:02:43.450> great<00:02:43.569> thing<00:02:43.659> is<00:02:43.870> if<00:02:44.110> you<00:02:44.200> pass<00:02:44.409> someone<00:02:44.680> a

00:02:44.789 --> 00:02:44.799 
the great thing is if you pass someone a

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:46.649 
the great thing is if you pass someone a
1d<00:02:45.159> RSO<00:02:45.579> and<00:02:45.849> they're<00:02:46.090> close<00:02:46.269> enough<00:02:46.299> for<00:02:46.540> the

00:02:46.649 --> 00:02:46.659 
1d RSO and they're close enough for the

00:02:46.659 --> 00:02:48.839 
1d RSO and they're close enough for the
next<00:02:46.870> one<00:02:46.989> they<00:02:47.079> can<00:02:47.230> jump<00:02:47.470> you<00:02:47.549> off<00:02:48.549> your<00:02:48.700> on

00:02:48.839 --> 00:02:48.849 
next one they can jump you off your on

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:51.240 
next one they can jump you off your on
the<00:02:48.909> lap<00:02:49.030> again<00:02:49.269> I<00:02:49.480> think<00:02:50.349> here<00:02:50.560> we<00:02:50.739> should<00:02:51.010> see

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:51.250 
the lap again I think here we should see

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:54.180 
the lap again I think here we should see
some<00:02:51.280> serious<00:02:52.319> some<00:02:53.319> serious<00:02:53.680> racing<00:02:53.920> you

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:54.190 
some serious some serious racing you

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:55.619 
some serious some serious racing you
know<00:02:54.250> and<00:02:54.549> you<00:02:54.760> might<00:02:54.909> see<00:02:55.060> some<00:02:55.299> real<00:02:55.480> good

00:02:55.619 --> 00:02:55.629 
know and you might see some real good

00:02:55.629 --> 00:02:57.660 
know and you might see some real good
battling<00:02:56.079> but<00:02:56.349> I<00:02:56.769> hope<00:02:57.190> that<00:02:57.370> we're<00:02:57.489> at<00:02:57.579> the

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:57.670 
battling but I hope that we're at the

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:00.449 
battling but I hope that we're at the
front<00:02:57.909> end<00:02:58.120> of<00:02:58.209> that<00:02:58.269> and<00:02:59.099> we<00:03:00.099> don't<00:03:00.220> have<00:03:00.340> to

00:03:00.449 --> 00:03:00.459 
front end of that and we don't have to

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:04.059 
front end of that and we don't have to
worry<00:03:00.579> about<00:03:00.670> it

00:03:04.059 --> 00:03:04.069 

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:06.130 

I<00:03:04.159> think<00:03:04.819> we<00:03:04.879> have<00:03:04.999> got<00:03:05.180> a<00:03:05.209> few<00:03:05.390> fans<00:03:05.629> in<00:03:05.780> Italy

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:06.140 
I think we have got a few fans in Italy

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:08.379 
I think we have got a few fans in Italy
and<00:03:06.349> you<00:03:07.219> know<00:03:07.370> they<00:03:07.730> know<00:03:07.879> a<00:03:07.909> good<00:03:08.060> team<00:03:08.269> when

00:03:08.379 --> 00:03:08.389 
and you know they know a good team when

00:03:08.389 --> 00:03:10.149 
and you know they know a good team when
they<00:03:08.450> see<00:03:08.599> one<00:03:08.930> and<00:03:09.170> they're<00:03:09.620> very<00:03:09.650> patchy<00:03:09.980> are

00:03:10.149 --> 00:03:10.159 
they see one and they're very patchy are

00:03:10.159 --> 00:03:11.860 
they see one and they're very patchy are
taken<00:03:10.400> very<00:03:10.430> supportive<00:03:10.909> of<00:03:10.999> Ferrari<00:03:11.239> and<00:03:11.569> no

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:11.870 
taken very supportive of Ferrari and no

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:15.039 
taken very supportive of Ferrari and no
one<00:03:12.019> else<00:03:12.310> so<00:03:13.310> that's<00:03:13.489> tough<00:03:13.730> but<00:03:14.060> it's<00:03:14.329> it's<00:03:14.930> a

00:03:15.039 --> 00:03:15.049 
one else so that's tough but it's it's a

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:16.629 
one else so that's tough but it's it's a
great<00:03:15.290> race<00:03:15.499> you<00:03:15.739> know<00:03:15.769> it's<00:03:16.010> a<00:03:16.069> fantastic

think we gain more and more patterns
