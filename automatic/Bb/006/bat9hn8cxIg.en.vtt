00:00:39.669 --> 00:00:39.679 
taking care but we take care of the skin

00:00:39.679 --> 00:00:41.380 
taking care but we take care of the skin
on<00:00:39.710> our<00:00:39.890> face<00:00:40.070> but<00:00:40.340> maybe<00:00:40.519> not<00:00:40.789> the<00:00:41.059> rest<00:00:41.239> of

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:41.390 
on our face but maybe not the rest of

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:43.479 
on our face but maybe not the rest of
our<00:00:41.480> bodies<00:00:41.840> and<00:00:42.050> it's<00:00:42.620> it's<00:00:42.949> funny<00:00:43.219> it's<00:00:43.429> a

00:00:43.479 --> 00:00:43.489 
our bodies and it's it's funny it's a

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:45.310 
our bodies and it's it's funny it's a
misconception<00:00:43.730> that<00:00:44.390> your<00:00:44.750> skin<00:00:45.019> is<00:00:45.050> really

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:45.320 
misconception that your skin is really

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:47.770 
misconception that your skin is really
self-cleaning<00:00:46.129> so<00:00:46.609> moisturizing<00:00:47.120> it<00:00:47.359> is<00:00:47.539> to

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:47.780 
self-cleaning so moisturizing it is to

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:50.110 
self-cleaning so moisturizing it is to
an<00:00:47.899> extent<00:00:48.350> but<00:00:48.500> in<00:00:48.859> our<00:00:49.100> very<00:00:49.519> westernized

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:50.120 
an extent but in our very westernized

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:52.689 
an extent but in our very westernized
society<00:00:50.839> we<00:00:51.109> are<00:00:51.140> drawn<00:00:51.620> to<00:00:51.649> washing<00:00:52.519> and

00:00:52.689 --> 00:00:52.699 
society we are drawn to washing and

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:55.090 
society we are drawn to washing and
soaping<00:00:53.300> once<00:00:53.690> or<00:00:53.929> even<00:00:54.170> twice<00:00:54.440> daily<00:00:54.800> and

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:55.100 
soaping once or even twice daily and

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:56.829 
soaping once or even twice daily and
that<00:00:55.190> just<00:00:55.399> wreaks<00:00:55.609> havoc<00:00:55.730> on<00:00:56.149> our<00:00:56.269> protective

00:00:56.829 --> 00:00:56.839 
that just wreaks havoc on our protective

00:00:56.839 --> 00:00:58.959 
that just wreaks havoc on our protective
skin<00:00:57.050> barrier<00:00:57.589> so<00:00:58.219> we<00:00:58.339> need<00:00:58.519> to<00:00:58.609> think<00:00:58.820> about

00:00:58.959 --> 00:00:58.969 
skin barrier so we need to think about

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:01.509 
skin barrier so we need to think about
the<00:00:59.239> rest<00:00:59.480> of<00:00:59.690> our<00:00:59.780> body<00:00:59.839> and<00:01:00.350> putting<00:01:01.070> back<00:01:01.280> in

00:01:01.509 --> 00:01:01.519 
the rest of our body and putting back in

00:01:01.519 --> 00:01:03.250 
the rest of our body and putting back in
that<00:01:01.699> moisture<00:01:01.879> in<00:01:02.269> that<00:01:02.449> barrier<00:01:02.929> and<00:01:03.140> that's

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:03.260 
that moisture in that barrier and that's

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:04.690 
that moisture in that barrier and that's
really<00:01:03.499> crucial<00:01:03.710> because<00:01:03.949> the<00:01:04.190> skin<00:01:04.370> on<00:01:04.520> your

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:04.700 
really crucial because the skin on your

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:06.910 
really crucial because the skin on your
face<00:01:04.730> has<00:01:05.180> more<00:01:05.510> oil<00:01:05.840> or<00:01:06.110> sebaceous<00:01:06.650> glands

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:06.920 
face has more oil or sebaceous glands

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:08.860 
face has more oil or sebaceous glands
than<00:01:07.160> the<00:01:07.250> rest<00:01:07.460> of<00:01:07.640> your<00:01:07.760> body<00:01:07.940> so<00:01:08.570> it's<00:01:08.750> not

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:08.870 
than the rest of your body so it's not

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:11.650 
than the rest of your body so it's not
as<00:01:09.200> inherently<00:01:09.770> moist<00:01:10.220> and<00:01:10.670> you<00:01:11.240> talked<00:01:11.510> about

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:11.660 
as inherently moist and you talked about

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:14.620 
as inherently moist and you talked about
soap<00:01:12.350> and<00:01:12.620> you<00:01:12.650> said<00:01:13.040> use<00:01:13.640> the<00:01:13.670> word<00:01:13.970> assault

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:14.630 
soap and you said use the word assault

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:16.480 
soap and you said use the word assault
when<00:01:15.110> you<00:01:15.230> talked<00:01:15.440> about<00:01:15.680> so<00:01:15.890> talk<00:01:16.340> to<00:01:16.460> us

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:16.490 
when you talked about so talk to us

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:19.030 
when you talked about so talk to us

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:19.040 
about that so so by definition is a

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:21.940 
about that so so by definition is a
