gluing the actual bed together so I'm

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.370 
gluing the actual bed together so I'm
going<00:02:37.150> to<00:02:37.180> glue<00:02:37.299> this<00:02:37.450> together<00:02:37.690> first<00:02:38.170> and

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:38.380 
going to glue this together first and

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:40.080 
going to glue this together first and
have<00:02:38.560> that<00:02:38.709> part<00:02:38.950> stick<00:02:39.190> up<00:02:39.340> just<00:02:39.640> a<00:02:39.790> little

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.090

bit right after you have your three main

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:45.330 
bit right after you have your three main
pieces<00:02:43.750> of<00:02:44.049> your<00:02:44.200> bed<00:02:44.319> constructed<00:02:44.950> then<00:02:45.190> you

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:45.340 
pieces of your bed constructed then you

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:49.170 
pieces of your bed constructed then you
can<00:02:45.519> start<00:02:46.860> building<00:02:47.860> your<00:02:48.220> mountain<00:02:48.640> bed<00:02:48.819> so

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
can start building your mountain bed so

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:51.300 
can start building your mountain bed so
like<00:02:49.360> I<00:02:49.480> can<00:02:49.780> glue<00:02:49.959> this<00:02:50.140> piece<00:02:50.380> on<00:02:50.620> here<00:02:51.099> and

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:51.310 
like I can glue this piece on here and

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:54.150 
like I can glue this piece on here and
you<00:02:51.459> can<00:02:51.670> do<00:02:51.819> this<00:02:51.970> however<00:02:52.239> you<00:02:52.480> want<00:02:52.599> to<00:02:53.160> all

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:55.630 
right so now our mountain bed is all

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:57.449 
right so now our mountain bed is all
glued<00:02:55.900> together<00:02:56.140> see<00:02:56.590> how<00:02:56.620> big<00:02:56.860> it<00:02:56.890> is<00:02:57.069> but<00:02:57.400> I

00:02:57.449 --> 00:02:57.459 
glued together see how big it is but I

00:02:57.459 --> 00:02:59.309 
glued together see how big it is but I
like<00:02:57.580> it<00:02:57.640> cuz<00:02:57.940> like<00:02:58.239> an<00:02:58.660> extension<00:02:59.019> of<00:02:59.200> the

round<00:03:06.970> small<00:03:07.510> cotton<00:03:07.900> balls<00:03:08.079> just<00:03:09.070> and<00:03:09.609> you

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:10.180 
round small cotton balls just and you

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:11.819 
round small cotton balls just and you
can<00:03:10.329> just<00:03:10.510> kind<00:03:10.720> of<00:03:10.870> pull<00:03:11.260> them<00:03:11.320> apart<00:03:11.470> a

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:11.829 
can just kind of pull them apart a

00:03:11.829 --> 00:03:15.420 
can just kind of pull them apart a
little<00:03:11.920> bit<00:03:12.220> still<00:03:12.700> leave<00:03:12.850> them<00:03:12.970> together<00:03:14.430> and

little bit still leave them together and

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:16.740 
little bit still leave them together and
it<00:03:15.579> would<00:03:15.730> give<00:03:15.850> the<00:03:16.000> appearance<00:03:16.239> of<00:03:16.510> like
