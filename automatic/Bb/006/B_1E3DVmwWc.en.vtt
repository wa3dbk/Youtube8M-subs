00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:09.629
 [Music] 

00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:15.799
 hello and welcome to another video tutorial 

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:18.020
 of +3 this time we will learn to 

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:22.160
 How to connect our device with 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:25.340
 android to a monitor in this case to 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:27.529
 through the hdmi cable and warm up in 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:29.719
 First place that our device is 

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:31.430
 compatible in my case I have a 

00:00:29.719 --> 00:00:34.520
 tablet with android that has a 

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:38.239
 mini hdmi output should be mentioned 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:41.610
 there are also nano hdmi outputs which 

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:43.650
 found mainly cell 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.050
 then what we avoid apart in this 

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:47.510
 tablet 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:52.010
 it is already good a cable that in a 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:54.980
 extreme has mini hdmi or in this case 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:56.629
 an adapter is still I bought it 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:58.790
 focus place 

00:00:56.629 --> 00:01:02.360
 It cost me two dollars if I'm not wrong 

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:03.559
 Free shipping takes about a month and a half 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:05.600
 but hey it did not come up so in the 

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:07.400
 problem progressed the issue nor tous 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:09.850
 adapter what he had to do is 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:13.310
 I'm just going simple in this case 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:16.759
 let me connect the adapter in 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:18.770
 the exit until I click and now 

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:20.830
 this part connect to the hdmi cable 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:23.080
 traditional 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:26.220
 let's put here is going to be is little and 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:26.220
 now if we connect the cable 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:32.540
 a very important advantage of hdmi is 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:34.850
 that also transmits the sound here by 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:37.280
 Unfortunately in my monitor more area but 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:39.470
 Well the important thing is to see how it is 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:41.520
 compatible a tablet in this case 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:43.710
 I want to learn 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:46.649
 because here you have to turn to monitor 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:48.899
 there it is perfect you can tell everything 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:50.310
 what happens on my tablet is reflected 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:52.230
 on the screen it could be that it's a 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:56.590
 mirror 

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:59.820
 few entry tasks to watch on youtube 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:02.130
 suppose account is going fluid 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:05.340
 without any problem 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:08.270
 let's open a video we got 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.270
 or to put 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:13.730
 new to have copyright because if not to 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.730
 while I close to the channel 

00:02:14.379 --> 00:02:19.570
 this 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:19.570
 okay 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:26.420
 but we oppose account 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:30.440
 the same thing that is being seen habitable is 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:33.390
 shown on this monitor here realize 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:37.980
 the tablet that question 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:39.750
 is totally dark in this case everything 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:42.209
 the graphic processing of the tablet 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:44.520
 the two ando to display video 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:49.050
 on the screen my screen appears on 

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:52.500
 aon this is full hd is 1080 by 1.220 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:54.240
 sorry for 1080 then you can see a 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:56.970
 little pixelated in this case the tablet does not 

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:59.220
 is full hd then comes pixelated 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:01.500
 you can find another good one because the 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:02.760
 theme is a way for example to be 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:05.830
 presentations we are going to open a 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:08.140
 benefit we have or something else 

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:10.780
 you can go for many functions and finally 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:13.090
 another very important thing is that they can 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:16.780
 capture in case you want to do 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:18.550
 some video the tutorial can also 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:20.740
 use this output to capture it with 

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:24.070
 some capturer for example that 

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:26.620
 bring hdmi video input what is going to 

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:29.290
 say brands but well it's also another 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:31.480
 way not to make videos like me 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:34.150
 I was story is with the camera 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:36.459
 and well I have no more to say 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:40.310
 another thing that go off for example the 

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:42.489
 tablet is civil screen 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:45.910
 but there is not going to be any change in it 

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:49.069
 that if it consumes much more light consume 

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:52.630
 almost double the stack is faster 

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:54.960
 to be honest I do not want to learn 

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:59.070
 although I think it's work 

00:03:54.960 --> 00:04:01.620
 although I repeat it is a good 

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:02.880
 function to another pass was forgotten in case 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:07.080
 that you are broken the screen 

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:11.090
 rotate it let's force it to rotate it up and 

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:13.709
 we will not automatically rotate the 

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:16.919
 automatically the screen administer 

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:18.900
 the video output is self-resizing 

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:22.049
 then so in this case now 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:23.940
 they are seeing it vertically 

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:26.160
 build had the tablet way 

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:29.060
 vertical but good is another thing that 

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:31.880
 have this application 

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:33.590
 as I repeat for the application of 

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:36.800
 this function petri the tablets with 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:39.290
 Android and good makes this video finish 

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:42.320
 real plus three how does it connect 

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:44.720
 tablet with android to a monitor in this 

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:47.030
 case through the HDMI output 

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:48.740
 account another very important thing in 

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:50.870
 to mention 

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:52.759
 is that you can connect it to endless 

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:55.460
 things for example video projectors 

00:04:52.759 --> 00:04:57.500
 capturing televisions with it 

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:59.690
 mentioned 

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:03.440
 but always that the receiving device 

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:05.030
 of the signal count with hdmi ok and good 

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:09.250
 until here ends now if this 

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:09.250
 material history until next time
