fast obviously it doesn't matter if the

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.439 
fast obviously it doesn't matter if the
brake<00:00:56.070> sweeps<00:00:56.370> the<00:00:56.520> pins<00:00:56.730> offer<00:00:57.000> them<00:00:57.270> to<00:00:57.300> the

so<00:01:51.100> we<00:01:51.189> can<00:01:51.369> you<00:01:51.700> could<00:01:51.850> actually<00:01:52.000> quality

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:52.600 
so we can you could actually quality

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:56.550 
so we can you could actually quality
exact<00:01:53.110> cap<00:01:53.409> of<00:01:53.650> 11<00:01:54.549> can<00:01:55.110> stuff<00:01:56.110> that<00:01:56.229> the<00:01:56.350> kind

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:56.560 
exact cap of 11 can stuff that the kind

of a neat idea to do see the right Allen
all<00:02:04.210> the<00:02:04.299> way<00:02:04.420> around<00:02:23.340> that's<00:02:24.340> pretty<00:02:24.550> much<00:02:24.700> it
