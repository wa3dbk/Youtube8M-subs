can use whatever password you want it

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:49.510 
can use whatever password you want it
doesn't<00:02:46.820> matter<00:02:47.470> and<00:02:48.470> then<00:02:48.709> you<00:02:49.190> want<00:02:49.370> to<00:02:49.430> hit

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:49.520 
doesn't matter and then you want to hit

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:55.620 
doesn't matter and then you want to hit
the<00:02:49.640> second<00:02:50.030> one<00:02:50.150> why<00:02:50.450> LS<00:02:50.720> teza<00:02:53.620> it<00:02:54.620> close<00:02:54.950> and

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:55.630 
the second one why LS teza it close and

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:59.680 
the second one why LS teza it close and
then<00:02:56.630> we're<00:02:56.810> gonna<00:02:56.959> hit<00:02:57.320> start<00:02:57.830> tethering

00:02:59.680 --> 00:02:59.690 
then we're gonna hit start tethering

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:01.900 
then we're gonna hit start tethering
we're<00:03:00.050> gonna<00:03:00.140> hit<00:03:00.290> grant<00:03:00.620> to<00:03:00.950> grant<00:03:01.520> super

we're gonna hit grant to grant super

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:05.460 
we're gonna hit grant to grant super
user<00:03:02.090> access<00:03:02.660> and<00:03:03.070> now<00:03:04.070> you<00:03:04.130> are<00:03:04.610> at<00:03:04.730> hazard

user access and now you are at hazard

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:08.560 
user access and now you are at hazard
okay<00:03:06.470> now<00:03:07.400> to<00:03:07.459> prove<00:03:07.850> that<00:03:08.000> I'm<00:03:08.150> actually

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:08.570 
okay now to prove that I'm actually

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:10.810 
okay now to prove that I'm actually
tested<00:03:08.900> and<00:03:09.019> I<00:03:09.110> am<00:03:09.290> on<00:03:09.470> 3G<00:03:09.860> this<00:03:10.190> will<00:03:10.489> work<00:03:10.640> for

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:10.820 
tested and I am on 3G this will work for

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:13.780 
tested and I am on 3G this will work for
4G<00:03:11.090> as<00:03:11.330> well<00:03:11.630> but<00:03:12.290> for<00:03:12.530> right<00:03:12.680> now<00:03:12.739> I<00:03:12.890> am<00:03:13.220> on<00:03:13.400> 3G

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:13.790 
4G as well but for right now I am on 3G

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:15.850 
4G as well but for right now I am on 3G
to<00:03:14.510> prove<00:03:14.690> that<00:03:14.840> this<00:03:15.110> actually<00:03:15.590> is<00:03:15.680> working

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:15.860 
to prove that this actually is working

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:19.420 
to prove that this actually is working
