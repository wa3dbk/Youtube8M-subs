00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:47.530 
because I think that helps them with

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:50.250 
because I think that helps them with
other<00:00:48.400> academics<00:00:48.970> like<00:00:49.180> mathematics<00:00:50.020> or

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:50.260 
other academics like mathematics or

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.590 
other academics like mathematics or
languages<00:00:51.160> because<00:00:51.730> they<00:00:51.910> will<00:00:52.060> take<00:00:52.240> risks

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:52.600 
languages because they will take risks

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:56.310

there too circle has a lot of rules to

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:59.340 
there too circle has a lot of rules to
follow<00:00:56.530> but<00:00:56.920> art<00:00:57.190> you<00:00:57.580> could<00:00:57.730> just<00:00:58.030> be<00:00:58.960> free

00:00:59.340 --> 00:00:59.350

you can see what you have in front of
you<00:01:01.630> and<00:01:01.900> then<00:01:02.080> just<00:01:02.350> make<00:01:02.560> that<00:01:02.800> turn<00:01:03.520> into

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:03.760 
you and then just make that turn into

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:05.700 
you and then just make that turn into
something<00:01:04.150> different<00:01:04.540> well<00:01:05.439> I<00:01:05.470> certainly

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:05.710 
something different well I certainly

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:09.510

programming<00:01:10.000> but<00:01:10.329> unfortunately<00:01:11.110> tax

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:11.560 
programming but unfortunately tax

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:13.410 
programming but unfortunately tax
funding<00:01:11.890> doesn't<00:01:12.070> pay<00:01:12.310> for<00:01:12.520> that<00:01:12.610> so<00:01:12.939> we<00:01:13.240> have

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:13.420 
funding doesn't pay for that so we have

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:15.480 
funding doesn't pay for that so we have
to<00:01:13.450> make<00:01:14.020> it<00:01:14.140> happen<00:01:14.290> ourselves<00:01:14.890> so<00:01:15.310> I<00:01:15.369> was
