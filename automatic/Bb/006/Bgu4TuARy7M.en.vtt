bought a blu-ray disc drive for your
computer<00:00:11.550> foolishly<00:00:12.480> thinking<00:00:13.019> that<00:00:13.200> you

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
computer foolishly thinking that you

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:15.609 
computer foolishly thinking that you
you'll<00:00:13.740> just<00:00:13.950> be<00:00:14.070> able<00:00:14.160> to<00:00:14.280> play<00:00:14.429> the<00:00:14.610> blu-rays

you'll just be able to play the blu-rays

00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:17.810 
you'll just be able to play the blu-rays
you'll<00:00:16.619> probably<00:00:16.920> have<00:00:17.190> found<00:00:17.460> that<00:00:17.609> this<00:00:17.760> is

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
you'll probably have found that this is

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.230 
you'll probably have found that this is
not<00:00:18.180> the<00:00:18.300> case<00:00:18.480> it's<00:00:19.080> not<00:00:19.230> that<00:00:19.529> simple<00:00:20.240> I

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
not the case it's not that simple I

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.170 
not the case it's not that simple I
found<00:00:22.020> a<00:00:22.109> few<00:00:22.289> methods<00:00:22.680> on<00:00:22.920> Google<00:00:23.340> none<00:00:24.000> of

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
found a few methods on Google none of

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:25.910 
found a few methods on Google none of
which<00:00:24.300> have<00:00:24.570> really<00:00:24.930> been<00:00:25.080> effective<00:00:25.529> for<00:00:25.560> me

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
which have really been effective for me

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.240 
which have really been effective for me
so<00:00:26.849> one<00:00:27.630> you<00:00:27.810> might<00:00:27.960> have<00:00:28.080> seen<00:00:28.320> is<00:00:28.529> the<00:00:28.740> paid

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
so one you might have seen is the paid

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.759 
so one you might have seen is the paid
for<00:00:29.429> software<00:00:29.849> I<00:00:30.119> think<00:00:30.630> such<00:00:30.840> as<00:00:30.990> a<00:00:31.019> CyberLink

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
for software I think such as a CyberLink

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:35.660 
for software I think such as a CyberLink
PowerDVD<00:00:33.530> who<00:00:34.530> really<00:00:34.739> wants<00:00:34.950> to<00:00:35.100> pay<00:00:35.640> for

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670

which actually works it's just a little

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:49.279 
which actually works it's just a little
time<00:00:46.770> consuming<00:00:47.340> it's<00:00:48.270> done<00:00:48.719> loading<00:00:48.840> make

you have is the main movie file yep when
you're<00:05:58.259> done<00:05:58.439> I'm<00:05:59.270> not<00:06:00.270> sure<00:06:00.449> if<00:06:00.599> it's

00:06:01.239 --> 00:06:01.249 
you're done I'm not sure if it's

00:06:01.249 --> 00:06:03.529 
you're done I'm not sure if it's
necessary<00:06:02.249> but<00:06:02.610> I<00:06:02.759> find<00:06:03.029> it's<00:06:03.150> good<00:06:03.389> practice

00:06:03.529 --> 00:06:03.539 
necessary but I find it's good practice

00:06:03.539 --> 00:06:07.249 
necessary but I find it's good practice
to<00:06:04.110> to<00:06:04.979> cancel<00:06:05.370> that<00:06:05.659> stop<00:06:06.659> reading<00:06:06.990> from<00:06:07.110> the

00:06:07.249 --> 00:06:07.259 
to to cancel that stop reading from the

00:06:07.259 --> 00:06:12.799 
to to cancel that stop reading from the
disk<00:06:09.199> and<00:06:11.059> then<00:06:12.059> from<00:06:12.330> there<00:06:12.479> you<00:06:12.569> can<00:06:12.689> just

00:06:12.799 --> 00:06:12.809 
disk and then from there you can just

00:06:12.809 --> 00:06:15.679 
disk and then from there you can just
eject<00:06:13.169> it<00:06:13.580> so<00:06:14.580> yeah<00:06:14.759> that<00:06:15.089> about<00:06:15.180> rounds<00:06:15.449> that

00:06:15.679 --> 00:06:15.689 
eject it so yeah that about rounds that

00:06:15.689 --> 00:06:18.950 
eject it so yeah that about rounds that
video<00:06:15.990> up<00:06:16.189> hope<00:06:17.189> it<00:06:17.339> was<00:06:17.460> helpful<00:06:17.490> I<00:06:18.029> might<00:06:18.809> do

00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:18.960 
video up hope it was helpful I might do

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:21.170 
video up hope it was helpful I might do
a<00:06:18.990> more<00:06:19.529> polished<00:06:19.740> version<00:06:20.339> in<00:06:20.520> the<00:06:20.789> future

00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:21.180 
a more polished version in the future

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:25.549 
a more polished version in the future
maybe<00:06:21.659> with<00:06:21.899> a<00:06:21.930> script<00:06:22.319> or<00:06:22.439> something<00:06:22.849> I<00:06:24.559> think

00:06:25.549 --> 00:06:25.559 
maybe with a script or something I think

00:06:25.559 --> 00:06:27.980 
maybe with a script or something I think
that<00:06:25.889> was<00:06:26.099> my<00:06:26.249> first<00:06:26.520> video<00:06:26.729> tutorial<00:06:26.990> using

00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:27.990 
that was my first video tutorial using

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:32.589 
that was my first video tutorial using
my<00:06:28.110> voice<00:06:28.319> no<00:06:28.620> less<00:06:28.830> and<00:06:29.539> yeah<00:06:30.539> so<00:06:30.839> we'll<00:06:31.020> see

00:06:32.589 --> 00:06:32.599 
my voice no less and yeah so we'll see

00:06:32.599 --> 00:06:36.469 
my voice no less and yeah so we'll see
as<00:06:33.599> you<00:06:33.930> can<00:06:34.050> see<00:06:34.259> it's<00:06:34.439> a<00:06:35.120> little<00:06:36.120> bit<00:06:36.240> of<00:06:36.389> a

00:06:36.469 --> 00:06:36.479 
as you can see it's a little bit of a

00:06:36.479 --> 00:06:39.980 
as you can see it's a little bit of a
procedure<00:06:36.870> but<00:06:37.699> once<00:06:38.699> you've<00:06:38.849> got<00:06:39.089> it<00:06:39.120> down<00:06:39.360> it

00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:39.990 
procedure but once you've got it down it

00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:42.139 
procedure but once you've got it down it
really<00:06:40.319> doesn't<00:06:40.589> take<00:06:40.620> any<00:06:41.039> more<00:06:41.639> time<00:06:41.699> than

00:06:42.139 --> 00:06:42.149 
really doesn't take any more time than

00:06:42.149 --> 00:06:44.629 
really doesn't take any more time than
actually<00:06:42.300> playing<00:06:42.719> a<00:06:43.289> blu-ray<00:06:43.680> on<00:06:43.830> a<00:06:43.860> natural

00:06:44.629 --> 00:06:44.639 
actually playing a blu-ray on a natural

00:06:44.639 --> 00:06:48.529 
actually playing a blu-ray on a natural
blu-ray<00:06:44.999> player<00:06:45.270> on<00:06:45.479> your<00:06:45.719> TV<00:06:46.069> um<00:06:47.509> one<00:06:48.509> thing

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:51.560 
to note is that make MKV is like a

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:53.739 
to note is that make MKV is like a
