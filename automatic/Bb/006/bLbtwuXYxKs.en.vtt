00:00:05.779 --> 00:00:10.679
 German company is one of 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.750
 market leaders in benz electrical engineering 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:14.730
 she has long established herself as 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.160
 reliable standalone manufacturer 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.449
 electricity generators in stock 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.740
 there are petrol power plants 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:23.850
 power from 650 to 8 thousand 500 watts 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.070
 inverter 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.080
 and diesel in the absence of 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.240
 centralized electrical network in the house 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.640
 workshop at the cottage or construction site 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.110
 such generators are indispensable 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.829
 equipment converts energy 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.520
 fuel combustion into electricity 

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:40.860
 power generators are used to 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.300
 emergency and main power supply 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.430
 by type of fuel 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.649
 they are divided into three groups of petrol and 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.090
 diesel and gas 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.160
 model range of petrol power plants 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:54.539
 allows you to choose a generator power 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:55.920
 from 650 to 8 thousand 500 watts with manual and 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:58.829
 electric starter 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:01.469
 there are models of various 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:03.239
 designs with wheels for easier 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:05.610
 moving station with remote control 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:07.500
 remote control with built-in 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:13.250
 automatic start system 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:15.720
 as well as with an output voltage of 380 volts 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:17.880
 some generators you can equip 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.530
 gas kit or 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.340
 automatic input device 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.650
 reserve 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.920
 but for example this model is equipped 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.490
 built-in welding machine 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:28.619
 inverter generators 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.000
 This mini power plants that issue 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:31.770
 current with the most stable 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.960
 parameters they work almost 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.840
 silent and lightweight 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.850
 but because more mobile inverter 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.950
 generators are recommended to ensure 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.810
 Autonomous power supply technology 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.000
 sensitive to voltage drops 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:47.579
 diesel generators are distinguished by high 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.409
 reliability and efficiency they 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:52.110
 designed for longer and 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:53.090
 continuous work besides they are simpler 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.649
 in maintenance 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:57.420
 mobile generator and cunning will provide 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:59.430
 you uninterrupted power in 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:03.140
 any situation you only have left 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.140
 decide which one to choose
