 regular use of shampoo gives 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:24.409
 hair strength and elasticity and i think 

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:26.869
 nobody needs to be reminded that shampoo 

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:29.060
 no balm should be used 

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:31.909

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:35.810

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:47.509
 noticeably larger volume after application 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:48.250
 balm hair becomes soft and

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:03.820
 clean hair i apply balm and 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:07.330
 back to my hair somewhere minutes 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:08.920
 in 15-20 that is, I wash the balm off 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:12.160
 hair not immediately after washing 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:14.230

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:18.910

 show in the east means not giving 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:35.830
 sit and it seems to me that we Europeans 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:37.900
 these herbs became known just 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:39.060
 thanks to the tiande company which came 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:42.690
 from tibet 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:45.250

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:47.310

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:50.320

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:52.739
 actively rejuvenating hair and stimulates 

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:56.080
 their growth prevents falling out 

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:58.090
 restore pigment shows possess 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:00.420
 near protective function effectively 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:03.040
 prevents age-related changes and 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:05.620
 protects against stress and negative 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:06.970
 the impact of the environment that is 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:09.310
 if you are girls or boys 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:11.760
 worried and feel that on 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:16.030
 your head will add one gray hair 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:18.600
 hair immediately keep in mind the grass fur coat 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:21.130
 you need shampoo and balm with grass show 

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:23.799
 the process of washing your head to show them 

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:27.090
 I will not invite you back my 

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:29.100
 hair already when they are clean 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:32.200
 back to my hair again 

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:35.380
 balm and shampoo with herb extract show 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:38.260
 and the next thing I want to do is 

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:40.390
 combing hair seems to me like a review 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:43.209
 shampoo would be incomplete without so girls 

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:46.660
 who are already tired of combing their 

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:49.450
 hair and rip out shreds not 

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:54.570
 find out how effective the balm 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:54.570
 helps combing hair 

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:33.910
 You combed and the next stage of our 

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:35.550
 care will be applying serum for 

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:38.320
 hair 

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:43.570
 in tiande there are capsule cosmetics 

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:47.290
 now show you it closer we have 

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:49.980
 in serum capsules it is not sold in 

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:49.980
 such jars 

00:04:54.770 --> 00:05:09.199
 and I want to apply this serum to myself 

00:04:57.289 --> 00:05:15.470
 hair and tail is cut off and the contents 

00:05:09.199 --> 00:05:18.620
 applied to wet hair i would 

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:20.560
 recommended such a capsule to use 

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:24.289
 on medium length hair 

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:27.310
 I think that such hair as mine to them 

00:05:24.289 --> 00:05:27.310
 need two capsules 

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:38.090
 such content is quite liquid 

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:46.230
 something applied to wet hair to 

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:49.340
 there were no split ends to 

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:49.340
 full hydration 

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:03.310
 very well it even distributed to me 

00:06:01.419 --> 00:06:06.550
 when I put it straight I feel on what 

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:08.439
 I already had a hair on feelings 

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:15.819
 hair where there is money 

00:06:08.439 --> 00:06:16.800
 where it is not yet and now go to 

00:06:15.819 --> 00:06:19.060
 styling 

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:21.310
 I will certainly invest with 

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:25.080
 means for styling and then 

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:25.080
 volume will see in a few minutes 

00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:43.970
 it seems to me enough so that you can 

00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:49.660
 see something done with them but 

00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:54.380
 yourself please rate yourself their volume and 

00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:56.750
 pomp density if you want yourself 

00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:59.300
