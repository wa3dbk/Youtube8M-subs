00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.010 
stiff body your drawing just stood there

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:17.920 
stiff body your drawing just stood there
you<00:02:16.310> actually<00:02:16.600> having<00:02:17.600> to<00:02:17.630> think<00:02:17.810> about

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930 
you actually having to think about

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:23.500 
you actually having to think about
foreshortening<00:02:18.860> which<00:02:19.070> is<00:02:21.640> quite<00:02:22.640> a<00:02:22.970> tough

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:23.510 
foreshortening which is quite a tough

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:28.390 
foreshortening which is quite a tough
skill<00:02:24.190> to<00:02:25.190> get<00:02:25.340> down<00:02:26.980> you<00:02:27.980> have<00:02:28.130> to<00:02:28.280> think

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 
skill to get down you have to think

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:29.890 
skill to get down you have to think
about<00:02:28.550> what<00:02:28.820> position<00:02:29.360> you're<00:02:29.480> seeing<00:02:29.750> the

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:29.900 
about what position you're seeing the

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:32.230 
about what position you're seeing the
head<00:02:30.080> and<00:02:30.290> the<00:02:30.350> face<00:02:30.530> from<00:02:30.920> now<00:02:31.640> that<00:02:31.850> makes<00:02:32.060> it

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:32.240 
head and the face from now that makes it

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:37.270 
head and the face from now that makes it
full<00:02:35.470> okay<00:02:36.470> so<00:02:36.530> we've<00:02:36.709> got<00:02:36.830> the<00:02:36.920> basic

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:37.280 
full okay so we've got the basic

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:38.680 
full okay so we've got the basic
skeleton<00:02:37.610> that's<00:02:38.000> out<00:02:38.209> now<00:02:38.360> I'm<00:02:38.480> just<00:02:38.570> going

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:38.690 
skeleton that's out now I'm just going

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
skeleton that's out now I'm just going
to<00:02:38.840> start
