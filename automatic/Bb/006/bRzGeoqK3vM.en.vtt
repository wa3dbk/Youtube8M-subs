00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:13.020
 simon rouse job founder of the kt forum 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.360
 We asked for his book without rollout 

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:17.160
 to clearly analyze dreams and enter 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.930
 Review to have fun with it 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.520
 the book contains many tips and 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.320
 suggestions for clear-dreaming is a 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.660
 lexicon structure missed and has about 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.519
 200 pages of the Amazon link is in the 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.869
 description 

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:29.609
 the book is just beautiful for me 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:31.320
 think so synonymous why a great many 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.030
 loving illustrations you want it 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.860
 simply reading is a pleasure to read 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.330
 She had many small details from the 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.610
 I really like that 

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:40.290
 is appealing and kombi wants this 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.339
 read book with his beginners 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.390
 had had a factory worth 

00:00:41.339 --> 00:00:44.430
 wants to be advanced it 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.110
 fachliteratur be amortized is 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.239
 linguistically super interesting 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.589
 megaspaÃŸ the strings just fly 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:51.180
 past you realize that there is no 

00:00:49.589 --> 00:00:52.409
 scientific book should be for 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.869
 it is a scientific book 

00:00:52.409 --> 00:00:56.670
 partly too undifferentiated too little 

00:00:54.869 --> 00:00:58.530
 detailed and you just can not find any 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.690
 do not swell studies or barely 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.430
 demir where you know someone has 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.619
 what is being investigated and that is a fact and 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.240
 That's not Simon's opinion, for example 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.650
 he says in the first chapter in the 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.660
 deep sleep phase for a cell division 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.070
 instead of the statement is something 

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:12.630
 superficially because he actually always 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.310
 human body cells body one 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.440
 do not know what 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.300
 He thinks he has two nice pictures 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:20.070
 for example, from a lr lr but the 

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:20.670
 Studies by leverage are missing at the beginning 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.020
 total 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.640
 I think of this illustration one 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.560
 community process, for example 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.290
 wrong he represented quasi says that 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.150
 the body only after the consciousness 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.440
 but strikes consciously and body 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.390
 you can not separate that one 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:35.159
 we know unity and suggestive 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.750
 that awareness through the 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.800
 various france states are moving 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.180
 also when falling asleep 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:40.740
 That's why I think that's relative 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.240
 superficially and simply not 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.159
 scientifically enough for a textbook 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.750
 for a beginner book it is something 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:47.010
 to look at it ambivalently 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.930
 Of course very well written 

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:50.610
 on the other side you have in the first 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.590
 chapter not really the mediation 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.600
 the fascination of the incredible 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:57.180
 incredible potential in the 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.400
 Subject as subject clearing is located 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:01.320
 what this theme will be on the other 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:03.780
 page are also just technical terms 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.720
 abbreviation unexplained imported large 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:08.119
 There's only in the middle of the could 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:10.399
 Beginners definitely refuse the topic 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:11.960
 Techniques most are present and 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:13.850
 also reasonably well explained 

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:15.740
 Techniques are generally quite whole 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:17.750
 well explained and also numerous represented 

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:19.430
 wdr de makes a bit of that 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:21.440
 at least in our opinion 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:22.880
 that he just declared you have to 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:24.920
 body pretend that you are now 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:26.600
 fall asleep that's actually a 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:28.010
 a little too short while doing that 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:29.540
 Of course, more in-depth and public 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:31.250
 can sell us also leads to this 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:32.900
 I am not allowed to do this wildly 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:34.400
 move and that's what beginner 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:37.160
 loses what start confused 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:38.780
 what brings you a wrong line too 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:40.370
 in our opinion also leads to 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:42.950
 Example keyword third there 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:44.480
 behind it really only the one picture 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:46.250
 that one wakes up for a short time and 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:47.870
 directly in again sinks into the dream 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:50.030
 that the noise but in the dream 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:51.560
 and we can almost hear it 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:53.270
 more completely out of this is our 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:54.980
 opinion after so insufficient lead 

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:56.480
 beginner works made me very disappointed 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:58.880
 his description of the clearly heating concept 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:01.459
 He introduces the concept of body clarity 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:03.560
 and you do not know where that comes from 

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:04.820
 the mental clarity works for it 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:06.470
 but not with that is very 

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:08.180
 pity and in the grip of the dreamed clear 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:10.310
 he does not differentiate enough 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:12.230
 I especially liked the content 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:13.790
 All faq passages are very good 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:15.860
 suitable for beginners because he really is yours 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:18.410
 quite typical questions were to be offered 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:20.120
 which we would under our videos too 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:22.190
 I found the ideas to be great 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:23.870
 or even the ideas for the dream notes 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:25.190
 there are some creative approaches there you can 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:26.690
 really cut a slice 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:28.160
 the book is lexicon-like written 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:29.840
 but it knows a bit 

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:32.450
 structural weaknesses on for example 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:34.070
 it has a nice glossary what many 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:36.410
 many shortcuts explained because he but 

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:38.480
 Not all in the middle of the book 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:40.250
 So where you last create 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:42.560
 would if one in a lexicon 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:44.989
 keyword index or after 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:46.459
 explained a glossary and that is how it is 

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:47.900
 So a structural weakness of this 

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:49.880
 There is also a book there as well 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:52.100
 for beginners confusing back there 

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:53.810
 three chapters from her titles 

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:55.310
 on actually the same content 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:57.470
 close but something completely different 

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:58.940
 want to convey there you have so 

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:00.769
 I think that's pretty easy 

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:02.900
 it is possible for beginners 

00:04:00.769 --> 00:04:04.370
 especially important in dld technology 

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:06.350
 critical questions to run for it 

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:09.130
 Do not share this book a blatant 

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:10.210
 Weakness is my personal massive 

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:12.250
 low point with this book like 

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:14.140
 fundamental importance will be mine 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:15.580
 opinion after not stressing enough that is 

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:17.260
 a shortcoming in any case 

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:18.850
 have to consider before getting this one 

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:20.410
 Maybe it's what it's about 

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:22.420
 Fits like advanced clear dreams 

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:24.520
 For example, simon does some 

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:26.110
 theories for handling dream figures 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:27.640
 But he did not ringing important and 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:29.860
 there is no right argument 

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:31.960
 he says, for example, one should use violence 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:33.280
 just take it as a last resort and we 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:34.600
 It's not that green at all 

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:36.040
 thing about the experienced claas 

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:38.260
 rohmeyer can exchange and their 

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:39.580
 Experiences can reveal something then 

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:41.020
 I was very surprised 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:42.520
 that he just does not differentiate 

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:44.200
 between clarity control stability 

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:45.790
 I would have wished for more 

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:47.020
 that he too is advanced 

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:48.700
 dreaming is small or for example 

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:51.160
 Pain and clear space can be loud 

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:51.730
 Simon does not feel fair when you do that 

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:53.170
 do not want to 

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:54.610
 and that's just not true you have to 

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:56.110
 Just click in the clearing room form 

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:58.110
 There are some reports and that is 

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:59.800
 unfortunately group generally has good for too 

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:01.390
 I found that he was advanced 

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:03.250
 at the beginning, where does it come from ? 

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:05.380
 dreams come for which purpose dreams in 

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:07.570
 Unfortunately, the body has been neglected 

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:09.280
 later in the book or for 

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:10.690
 in general this has a theory 

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:12.070
 I would have simply wished that 

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:13.660
 has that through because that's a real one 

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:15.820
 was an ingenious approach and I think that 

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:17.970
 That's what works only a few 

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:20.650
 create this bridge to beat from 

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:22.390
 psychologically relevant to the actual 

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:23.800
 effectively practical one point of mine 

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:25.270
 also noticed I do not want 

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:27.220
 say that it bothered me but 

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:29.140
 especially for beginners and advanced 

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:30.580
 dreams are nevertheless oriented towards 

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:32.290
 Orientation dream reports a lot 

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:33.790
 helpful the flags in this book 

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:35.740
 just compared for example with the 

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:37.300
 standard factory of paul zsolnay very 

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:38.500
 very scanty out there they exist 

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:42.100
 but occasionally in a much shorter version 

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:43.210
 form and all come from the author 

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:44.890
 I would just have a little bit 

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:46.720
 more diversity desired bit more 

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:48.670
 Diversity that would be right for the book 

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:51.550
 well done tools like tools 

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:53.410
 the cod mw or for example substances 

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:54.910
 the allegedly clear hit clear dreams 

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:56.560
 should promote if unfortunately not 

00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:58.450
 that's what that is 

00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:59.890
 really interesting for everyone for 

00:05:58.450 --> 00:06:01.600
 address every target group 

00:05:59.890 --> 00:06:03.190
 why is that they are not in it for 

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:04.690
 advanced clear dreams and as 

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:07.060
 textbook, it is rather less suitable 

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:09.400
 for beginners, it is partially suitable 

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:09.849
 but there is such a big market 

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:11.800
 and me 

00:06:09.849 --> 00:06:13.779
 Just book me in europe studies 

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:15.490
 and why do you need it there? 

00:06:13.779 --> 00:06:16.899
 a book I finds a pity that simon 

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:18.159
 not simply said okay I did so 

00:06:16.899 --> 00:06:18.999
 a lot of experience i am doing a book now 

00:06:18.159 --> 00:06:20.529
 for advanced 

00:06:18.999 --> 00:06:22.779
 what a little over the edge of the plate 

00:06:20.529 --> 00:06:25.449
 It's time for a conclusion 

00:06:22.779 --> 00:06:26.889
 For me it's a book which really 

00:06:25.449 --> 00:06:29.409
 what is really nice for me 

00:06:26.889 --> 00:06:30.339
 very much like linguistically and also from 

00:06:29.409 --> 00:06:31.689
 the presentation 

00:06:30.339 --> 00:06:33.309
 However, I miss the dream 

00:06:31.689 --> 00:06:34.779
 reports that it is a beginner 

00:06:33.309 --> 00:06:36.520
 be the book but the springs fell 

00:06:34.779 --> 00:06:37.059
 for that reasonably scientific 

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:38.939
 should be 

00:06:37.059 --> 00:06:40.479
 Unfiltered deep can make it in there 

00:06:38.939 --> 00:06:42.099
 should be advanced book 

00:06:40.479 --> 00:06:43.509
 that's why i can not do that well for me 

00:06:42.099 --> 00:06:45.729
 really classify has no direct 

00:06:43.509 --> 00:06:47.619
 in relation to the fact 

00:06:45.729 --> 00:06:48.849
 but that it has two elements 

00:06:47.619 --> 00:06:50.289
 I'm really very good 

00:06:48.849 --> 00:06:52.719
 fallen is definitely still irritating 

00:06:50.289 --> 00:06:55.599
 I give the book 6 and 10 

00:06:52.719 --> 00:06:56.619
 there are tommy heads to distribute this 

00:06:55.599 --> 00:06:58.269
 just looks good 

00:06:56.619 --> 00:06:59.919
 the language is wonderful but when 

00:06:58.269 --> 00:07:02.110
 content accumulate these small errors 

00:06:59.919 --> 00:07:04.569
 make it a rather big mistake 

00:07:02.110 --> 00:07:06.939
 Construction moderately, the book would really have one 

00:07:04.569 --> 00:07:08.949
 few improvements needed there are none 

00:07:06.939 --> 00:07:10.360
 hardly studies and that are the sources 

00:07:08.949 --> 00:07:12.069
 things which I then used for in the 

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:13.059
 unfortunately, only five out of ten nico book 

00:07:12.069 --> 00:07:15.939
 to give heads 

00:07:13.059 --> 00:07:17.979
 ready to buy us 

00:07:15.939 --> 00:07:20.229
 the book and then you can do that 

00:07:17.979 --> 00:07:22.930
 find house after no matter me grille woman 

00:07:20.229 --> 00:07:26.649
 to sex so altogether 12 more than 10 

00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:29.159
 it was the 12 out of 10 of each so 

00:07:26.649 --> 00:07:34.019
 So if you put it that way though 

00:07:29.159 --> 00:07:34.019
 more than 10 of the king's breaking bill 

00:07:36.289 --> 00:07:39.740
 if you liked the video then 

00:07:37.849 --> 00:07:40.189
 be nice and leave your thumb behind 

00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:44.029
 above 

00:07:40.189 --> 00:07:47.869
 if not mix and comments and 

00:07:44.029 --> 00:07:51.819
 we need yes we love the movie and 

00:07:47.869 --> 00:07:51.819
 we stand bye bye
