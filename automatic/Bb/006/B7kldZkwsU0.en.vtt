00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
the circle do some skids get I think a

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:29.629 
the circle do some skids get I think a
blister<00:03:26.819> going<00:03:28.250> all<00:03:29.250> right<00:03:29.340> that<00:03:29.459> should<00:03:29.489> be

00:03:29.629 --> 00:03:29.639 
blister going all right that should be

just drive away from them from the

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:37.370 
just drive away from them from the
mission<00:03:35.599> here<00:03:36.599> we<00:03:36.690> go<00:03:36.810> it<00:03:36.930> was<00:03:37.079> just<00:03:37.230> gonna

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:37.380 
mission here we go it was just gonna

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:39.440 
mission here we go it was just gonna
bugger<00:03:37.739> off<00:03:37.950> up<00:03:38.130> here<00:03:38.160> right<00:03:39.060> and<00:03:39.269> it<00:03:39.359> will

behind<00:03:41.370> you<00:03:41.579> found<00:03:41.819> a<00:03:41.910> mission<00:03:42.150> that's

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:42.359 
behind you found a mission that's

00:03:42.359 --> 00:03:45.020 
behind you found a mission that's
absolutely<00:03:42.780> fine<00:03:43.049> what<00:03:43.680> you<00:03:43.769> want<00:03:43.919> to<00:03:43.980> do<00:03:44.099> so

absolutely fine what you want to do so

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:47.960 
absolutely fine what you want to do so
it<00:03:45.090> comes<00:03:45.269> up<00:03:45.450> is<00:03:45.799> exit<00:03:46.799> don't<00:03:47.370> replay<00:03:47.669> it<00:03:47.819> you

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:47.970 
it comes up is exit don't replay it you

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:49.580 
it comes up is exit don't replay it you
will<00:03:48.090> lose<00:03:48.239> all<00:03:48.269> mission<00:03:48.660> progress<00:03:48.870> yes<00:03:49.319> we

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:49.590 
will lose all mission progress yes we

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:51.140 
will lose all mission progress yes we
don't<00:03:49.680> care<00:03:49.919> about<00:03:49.950> that<00:03:50.280> we're<00:03:50.790> not<00:03:50.849> here<00:03:51.030> to

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:51.150 
don't care about that we're not here to

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:52.309 
don't care about that we're not here to
complete<00:03:51.389> the<00:03:51.450> mission<00:03:51.569> we're<00:03:52.019> here<00:03:52.139> to<00:03:52.230> get

00:03:52.309 --> 00:03:52.319 
complete the mission we're here to get

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:56.360 
complete the mission we're here to get
the<00:03:52.380> car<00:03:52.669> so<00:03:53.669> the<00:03:54.329> reason<00:03:54.599> I<00:03:54.690> say<00:03:54.950> safe<00:03:55.950> before

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:56.370 
the car so the reason I say safe before

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:58.009 
the car so the reason I say safe before
you<00:03:56.430> do<00:03:56.579> this<00:03:56.700> is<00:03:56.910> because<00:03:56.970> this<00:03:57.419> place<00:03:57.660> this

00:03:58.009 --> 00:03:58.019 
you do this is because this place this

00:03:58.019 --> 00:03:59.300 
you do this is because this place this
mission<00:03:58.380> takes<00:03:58.590> place<00:03:58.829> right<00:03:58.859> outside

00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.310 
mission takes place right outside

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:02.629 
mission takes place right outside
Michael's<00:03:59.880> house<00:04:00.030> basically<00:04:00.950> so<00:04:01.950> you<00:04:02.250> want

00:04:02.629 --> 00:04:02.639 
Michael's house basically so you want

00:04:02.639 --> 00:04:03.770 
Michael's house basically so you want
the<00:04:02.700> game<00:04:02.819> to<00:04:03.000> create<00:04:03.239> a<00:04:03.329> restore<00:04:03.569> point

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:03.780 
the game to create a restore point

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:06.470 
the game to create a restore point
outside<00:04:04.579> Michael's<00:04:05.579> house<00:04:05.760> again<00:04:06.090> we've<00:04:06.329> been

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:06.480 
outside Michael's house again we've been

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:08.360 
outside Michael's house again we've been
raisin<00:04:06.810> you<00:04:07.260> know<00:04:07.380> because<00:04:07.650> that's<00:04:08.010> where<00:04:08.280> we

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:08.370 
raisin you know because that's where we

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:10.159 
raisin you know because that's where we
just<00:04:08.549> got<00:04:08.669> a<00:04:08.700> card<00:04:08.940> to<00:04:09.090> spawn<00:04:09.359> okay

00:04:10.159 --> 00:04:10.169 
just got a card to spawn okay

00:04:10.169 --> 00:04:11.599 
just got a card to spawn okay
so<00:04:10.530> that's<00:04:10.709> why<00:04:10.829> it's<00:04:10.980> important<00:04:11.340> to<00:04:11.370> say

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:11.609 
so that's why it's important to say

00:04:11.609 --> 00:04:15.349 
so that's why it's important to say
first<00:04:11.940> as<00:04:12.239> Michael<00:04:13.230> so<00:04:14.160> that<00:04:14.310> when<00:04:14.459> you<00:04:14.609> quit

00:04:15.349 --> 00:04:15.359 
first as Michael so that when you quit

00:04:15.359 --> 00:04:17.180 
first as Michael so that when you quit
the<00:04:15.450> mission<00:04:15.720> it<00:04:15.900> push<00:04:16.079> you<00:04:16.229> back<00:04:16.410> in<00:04:16.950> his

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:17.190 
the mission it push you back in his

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:19.789 
the mission it push you back in his
neighborhood<00:04:17.700> basically<00:04:18.440> so<00:04:19.440> you'll<00:04:19.560> be<00:04:19.650> back

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:19.799 
neighborhood basically so you'll be back

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:21.529 
neighborhood basically so you'll be back
there<00:04:20.010> I've<00:04:20.430> just<00:04:20.609> got<00:04:20.909> the<00:04:21.000> blisters<00:04:21.419> to

00:04:21.529 --> 00:04:21.539 
there I've just got the blisters to

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:23.779 
there I've just got the blisters to
start<00:04:21.750> spawning<00:04:21.989> so<00:04:22.979> now<00:04:23.099> they<00:04:23.219> should<00:04:23.430> be<00:04:23.460> all

00:04:23.779 --> 00:04:23.789 
start spawning so now they should be all

00:04:23.789 --> 00:04:24.820 
start spawning so now they should be all
over<00:04:24.060> the<00:04:24.150> map

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:24.830 
over the map

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:27.640 
over the map
I<00:04:25.419> tried<00:04:26.419> to<00:04:26.539> literally<00:04:26.960> guys<00:04:27.199> I<00:04:27.229> tried<00:04:27.409> this

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:27.650 
I tried to literally guys I tried this

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:29.170 
I tried to literally guys I tried this
about<00:04:27.860> eight<00:04:28.009> times<00:04:28.190> yesterday<00:04:28.520> to<00:04:28.789> make<00:04:29.060> sure

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:29.180 
about eight times yesterday to make sure

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:31.540 
about eight times yesterday to make sure
it<00:04:29.330> work<00:04:29.509> it<00:04:29.780> worked<00:04:30.080> every<00:04:30.259> single<00:04:30.979> time<00:04:31.190> it's

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:31.550 
it work it worked every single time it's

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:33.960 
it work it worked every single time it's
foolproof<00:04:31.940> you<00:04:32.750> might<00:04:32.960> not<00:04:33.139> find<00:04:33.319> it<00:04:33.530> you<00:04:33.560> know

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:33.970 
foolproof you might not find it you know

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:36.129 
foolproof you might not find it you know
yesterday<00:04:34.970> I<00:04:35.150> didn't<00:04:35.569> find<00:04:35.720> one<00:04:35.870> for<00:04:36.020> about

00:04:36.129 --> 00:04:36.139 
yesterday I didn't find one for about

00:04:36.139 --> 00:04:38.680 
yesterday I didn't find one for about
three<00:04:36.440> or<00:04:36.470> four<00:04:36.680> minutes<00:04:36.949> and<00:04:37.180> but<00:04:38.180> I<00:04:38.389> found

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:38.690 
three or four minutes and but I found

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:40.180 
three or four minutes and but I found
one<00:04:38.810> eventually<00:04:39.080> because<00:04:39.560> like<00:04:39.889> I<00:04:40.009> say

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:40.190 
one eventually because like I say

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:42.040 
one eventually because like I say
because<00:04:40.729> she<00:04:40.759> was<00:04:40.970> driving<00:04:41.210> it<00:04:41.479> it<00:04:41.629> goes<00:04:41.840> into

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:42.050 
because she was driving it it goes into

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:45.189 
because she was driving it it goes into
the<00:04:42.199> spawn<00:04:42.470> rotation<00:04:43.009> so<00:04:43.580> it<00:04:44.000> will<00:04:44.659> get<00:04:44.900> you

00:04:45.189 --> 00:04:45.199 
the spawn rotation so it will get you

00:04:45.199 --> 00:04:46.809 
the spawn rotation so it will get you
know<00:04:45.349> it<00:04:45.500> will<00:04:45.680> start<00:04:45.949> spawning<00:04:46.190> eventually

00:04:46.809 --> 00:04:46.819 
know it will start spawning eventually

00:04:46.819 --> 00:04:49.899 
know it will start spawning eventually
let<00:04:47.180> me<00:04:47.270> just<00:04:47.889> edit<00:04:48.889> this<00:04:48.979> quickly<00:04:49.220> yep

00:04:49.899 --> 00:04:49.909 
let me just edit this quickly yep

00:04:49.909 --> 00:04:52.149 
let me just edit this quickly yep
so<00:04:50.690> it<00:04:50.870> will<00:04:50.990> start<00:04:51.229> spawning<00:04:51.440> as<00:04:51.710> a<00:04:51.830> promise

00:04:52.149 --> 00:04:52.159 
so it will start spawning as a promise

00:04:52.159 --> 00:04:55.659 
so it will start spawning as a promise
but<00:04:52.849> what<00:04:53.150> you<00:04:53.270> do<00:04:53.419> not<00:04:53.539> want<00:04:53.720> to<00:04:53.810> do<00:04:53.960> is<00:04:54.550> get<00:04:55.550> in

00:04:55.659 --> 00:04:55.669 
but what you do not want to do is get in

00:04:55.669 --> 00:04:57.790 
but what you do not want to do is get in
any<00:04:55.879> other<00:04:55.970> car<00:04:56.330> do<00:04:56.539> not<00:04:56.569> get<00:04:56.990> in<00:04:57.080> a<00:04:57.139> car<00:04:57.379> until

00:04:57.790 --> 00:04:57.800 
any other car do not get in a car until

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:00.129 
any other car do not get in a car until
you<00:04:57.949> find<00:04:58.219> a<00:04:58.310> blister<00:04:58.810> because<00:04:59.810> what<00:05:00.110> that

00:05:00.129 --> 00:05:00.139 
you find a blister because what that

00:05:00.139 --> 00:05:01.450 
you find a blister because what that
will<00:05:00.379> do<00:05:00.500> is<00:05:00.650> it<00:05:00.770> will<00:05:00.830> change<00:05:01.039> the<00:05:01.219> car's

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:01.460 
will do is it will change the car's

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:04.360 
will do is it will change the car's
spool<00:05:02.330> rotations<00:05:02.870> again<00:05:03.139> and<00:05:03.379> you<00:05:04.129> will<00:05:04.250> not

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:04.370 
spool rotations again and you will not

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:05.589 
spool rotations again and you will not
find<00:05:04.580> one<00:05:04.729> and<00:05:04.969> once<00:05:05.150> it's<00:05:05.330> going<00:05:05.449> straight

00:05:05.589 --> 00:05:05.599 
find one and once it's going straight

00:05:05.599 --> 00:05:07.119 
find one and once it's going straight
past<00:05:05.930> me<00:05:06.080> you<00:05:06.139> see<00:05:06.289> that<00:05:06.440> that<00:05:06.680> is<00:05:06.830> one<00:05:06.949> of<00:05:07.039> the

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:28.370 
don't get which you will because like I

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:29.920 
don't get which you will because like I
say<00:05:28.610> I've<00:05:28.759> tried<00:05:29.000> it<00:05:29.120> about<00:05:29.300> eight<00:05:29.449> times
