00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:22.210 
ribbon you can I'm just going to kind of

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:24.510 
ribbon you can I'm just going to kind of
tuck<00:04:22.419> ours<00:04:22.660> under<00:04:23.080> so<00:04:24.039> there<00:04:24.220> are<00:04:24.280> several

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:24.520 
tuck ours under so there are several

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:26.219 
tuck ours under so there are several
different<00:04:24.669> ways<00:04:24.970> you<00:04:25.120> can<00:04:25.419> finish<00:04:25.690> this<00:04:25.960> off

00:04:26.219 --> 00:04:26.229 
different ways you can finish this off

00:04:26.229 --> 00:04:28.860 
different ways you can finish this off
if<00:04:26.530> you<00:04:27.039> want<00:04:27.250> to<00:04:27.490> make<00:04:27.820> a<00:04:27.850> braid<00:04:28.240> around<00:04:28.750> the

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:28.870 
if you want to make a braid around the

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:30.210 
if you want to make a braid around the
base<00:04:29.050> of<00:04:29.080> that<00:04:29.470> I<00:04:29.500> think<00:04:29.770> that<00:04:30.070> would<00:04:30.190> be

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:30.220 
base of that I think that would be

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:31.920 
base of that I think that would be
really<00:04:30.610> pretty<00:04:30.820> that's<00:04:31.240> one<00:04:31.419> way<00:04:31.570> to<00:04:31.600> do<00:04:31.900> it

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:31.930 
really pretty that's one way to do it

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:34.260 
really pretty that's one way to do it
I'm<00:04:32.590> actually<00:04:32.919> just<00:04:33.250> going<00:04:33.430> to<00:04:33.580> make<00:04:33.729> a<00:04:33.759> simple

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:34.270 
I'm actually just going to make a simple

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:36.960 
I'm actually just going to make a simple
twist<00:04:34.680> so<00:04:35.680> to<00:04:35.770> do<00:04:36.039> that<00:04:36.070> I'm<00:04:36.430> going<00:04:36.610> to<00:04:36.729> start

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:36.970 
twist so to do that I'm going to start

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:38.640 
twist so to do that I'm going to start
here<00:04:37.030> at<00:04:37.300> the<00:04:37.419> bottom<00:04:37.600> and<00:04:38.020> just<00:04:38.380> kind<00:04:38.590> of

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:38.650 
here at the bottom and just kind of

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:40.800 
here at the bottom and just kind of
loosely<00:04:39.039> twist<00:04:39.520> that<00:04:39.699> hair<00:04:40.000> kind<00:04:40.419> of<00:04:40.510> around

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:40.810 
loosely twist that hair kind of around
