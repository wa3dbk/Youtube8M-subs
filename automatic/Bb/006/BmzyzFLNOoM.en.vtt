00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:14.969
 and I stand here with hans jürgen 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:16.109
 werner of intel us now 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:17.820
 little bit about the new ultrabooks 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:18.900
 will tell what is there with it 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.000
 contains this year so very special 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.650
 new so first there may be 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.630
 basically a huge selection of 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.609
 ultrabooks we know the ultrabooks yes 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.740
 already the beautiful super flat 18 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:31.650
 millimeters maximum five hours thick 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.969
 battery life start very fast 7 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.460
 in seconds you are there seven seconds 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:36.960
 they are there and the whole is now 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.730
 of course connected with what is coming 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.129
 windows 8 that means suddenly 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.899
 touch but if it is just touch hard 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:44.850
 yes almost boring though I am 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:47.190
 must confess I have keyboard and 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.289
 touch together what a great 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.640
 Nice story is so I click 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.899
 do my e-mail then I type 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.160
 times an e-mail adress clicks now 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:55.020
 I also press the object and press 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.670
 I use my keyboard back so the mouse 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:00.120
 Of course that's gone, that's so intuitive 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.559
 So even the ultrabook with keyboard 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.629
 and touch is a great combination 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:05.850
 but then what we have left are then 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:07.710
 still devices that allow me where I 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.869
 push the screen forward 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.159
 Clark is up there pushing again 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:11.580
 I only have one tray in the bottom 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.170
 hand 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.939
 then there are others who have one 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.740
 strap mechanic has that hovers then 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:17.880
 short and clack goes down again 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.560
 there are others namely the screen 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.670
 Just let the computer down 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.740
 computer behind the screen 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.780
 yes and then these devices even drive 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.630
 still in such a deeper power mode 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.400
 that means it lasts even longer because 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.659
 the tablet itself so the 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.340
 Of course, video itself does not have that way 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.810
 a big battery that means there drives 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.670
 you automatically enter a car 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.650
 a little further down but no 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.659
 great performance loss so 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:41.570
 that is, the dinger always plant to 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:43.439
 that works really well 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:44.790
 Well, that's actually it 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:46.470
 most beautiful we see this huge 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:49.140
 Variety We see notebooks like that 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:52.140
 can turn 360 ° that's from the 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.579
 novo the yoga I have that as normal as 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.290
 notebook and then when I want tablet 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:56.700
 then turning is all around 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.689
 probably the show in the café 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.399
 We do not like that when he suddenly 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:00.930
 anna that sees it reminds me of so 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:03.479
 The rubber people so a bit 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:05.729
 tricks around has a tablet so there are 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:06.790
 really the variety is so nice 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:10.119
 to see that like that 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:12.040
 That's what innovation comes from 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:13.810
 old box I've seen yes mine 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:15.310
 screen in the normal way, I again 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:16.480
 my keyboard on the back 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:18.430
 yes and screen built 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:20.410
 that is still separate this year 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:21.880
 that means I could my pictures from 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:24.580
 Holiday presents the thing stands up 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:25.960
 so by the table and freak or me 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:27.460
 make a presentation in the small one 

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:29.770
 circular'm in this business unit 

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:32.140
 Asus has built something like that 

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:33.880
 Samsung has Mr. Dieter Schaefer us 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:36.550
 have the sonys with so-called slider 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:38.620
 and toshiba with clothes so everyone has 

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:41.620
 some special innovation something 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:43.180
 special so that the fujitsu has that 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:44.950
 a business variant optional docking 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:47.350
 stations created docking station 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:49.120
 connector in this situation are yes then 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:50.200
 only ten millimeters left 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:53.290
 because we are not down a screen 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:56.170
 calculator so very interesting 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:57.520
 old books that make a lot of fun 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:58.930
 and I think that 's what it's about 

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:00.340
 has called the definition of the old fox 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:01.570
 in comparison to last year already 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:02.980
 also a bit changed in the last one 

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:05.050
 year were mainly there is a 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:06.880
 traditional notebook form very thin 

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:08.350
 very powerful but this year 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:09.610
 has done a little something 

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:10.830
 you say what to unfold 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:13.150
 screen in all colors and shapes 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:14.800
 how it looks in the future from what you have 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:17.019
 her for visions for the next 

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:17.500
 generation otterbox there is already 

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:19.360
 plans 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:21.519
 So of course we have ideas I have to 

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:23.590
 just one last thing to say that 

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:25.180
 Altenburg was in favor from the beginning 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:27.580
 thought that will be I have the album 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:30.070
 described as the child from the tray and 

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:32.290
 from the notebook and what comes out of it 

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:33.670
 should be the best of both worlds be 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:35.470
 that does not mean it's a the 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:37.900
 others will not replace that my theme but 

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:39.190
 i have something here when i tablet 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:41.980
 will want when I found I 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:44.470
 tablet when i'm old but not notebook 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:46.450
 i need keyboard and i can do that 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:48.310
 So you and now comes with touch 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:48.700
 exactly where are we going next? 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:50.470
 step 

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:53.019
 well, well, we believe that more so 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:55.450
 natural typing types like touch 

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:57.130
 yes go already started today 

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:58.360
 as there are certain things the language 

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:01.090
 that's for sure 

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:03.850
 things are coming like gestures, and that's where things are here 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:05.260
 of course always on the subject 

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:07.220
 Of course, we want it that way 

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:09.560
 as widely available as possible 

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:11.300
 the largest possible selection 

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:13.130
 Just give people if not the fan 

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:15.500
 from menowin then I will from leone 

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:17.480
 Variant are so cool if I'm so cool 

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:18.620
 then I'll find a cool one from asus 

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:20.359
 find a variant for it 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:22.280
 the second regretting that hand is 

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:24.410
 the price points to which then 

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:24.980
 of course, vary too 

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:27.680
 beautiful 

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:29.930
 that is I have seen now there is 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:31.610
 Old books were rare here and there 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:34.010
 for 599 euros 

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:37.370
 we will see that is likely 

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:39.470
 I have such ideas that is touch variants 

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:41.750
 normal touch will give variations 

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:44.990
 probably for 749 maybe for 

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:46.580
 699 and everything that comes next is 

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:48.530
 of course on top of it but it had too 

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:49.910
 the extra then I am suddenly in the 

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:50.750
 5 or 7 series was sometimes 

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:52.850
 want to compare 

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:55.520
 that is a qe3 to name it 

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:56.960
 call with touch for under 800 euros 

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:59.419
 not so far away anymore 

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:00.320
 is very realistic very realistic yes 

00:04:59.419 --> 00:05:01.940
 the thing wonderful 

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:05.380
 thank you very much that some and werner and 

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:05.380
 connected back
