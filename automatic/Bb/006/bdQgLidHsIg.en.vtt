00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:41.180 
whoever I was working with as far as

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:44.569 
whoever I was working with as far as
butch<00:01:42.180> Reed<00:01:42.680> you<00:01:43.680> know<00:01:43.770> he<00:01:43.950> was<00:01:44.130> the<00:01:44.280> stiffer

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
butch Reed you know he was the stiffer

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.429 
butch Reed you know he was the stiffer
of<00:01:44.790> the<00:01:44.909> two<00:01:45.119> and<00:01:45.420> he<00:01:45.720> was<00:01:45.899> hardest<00:01:46.259> to

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.740 
of the two and he was hardest to
maneuver<00:01:46.979> so<00:01:47.240> that's<00:01:48.240> probably<00:01:48.540> why<00:01:48.689> we

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
maneuver so that's probably why we

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.450 
maneuver so that's probably why we
didn't<00:01:49.049> beat<00:01:49.200> him<00:01:49.350> that<00:01:49.409> night<00:01:49.829> but<00:01:50.130> anyway
