00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:10.740
 hi guys baquba iraq in so long 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.240
 that I do not lie 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.340
 total debt a habit of saying this 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.770
 I've been addicted to saying that but 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:19.140
 Finally there yes I'm starting all over 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.330
 series and I'll take courage I'll make the 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.020
 an entire spain since the 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.380
 first 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:29.330
 but since I'm not a study, I call the 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.330
 people who are not true even is 

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:38.940
 really played max pn 1 in 2001 2002 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:41.070
 I do not remember the birth g2 I was little 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.260
 you can not be there I finished the three 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.180
 Sometimes I will not speak 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.750
 I have three here it is not possible to do 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:52.140
 inter series max and faces the auxerre 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:55.980
 emme much as the love of criticism 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:01:03.390
 other videos available - so the 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:05.070
 staff always play more in the game is 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.840
 translated into Portuguese and I know that 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.780
 You talk about your having your production. 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.970
 because it is very rough and ugly but I do not know 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.280
 if I win a new version of 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:18.150
 teenager, it's cool, I never liked it 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:20.610
 Arrived and it 's not cool, very good. 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.350
 Yes, I'm going to play this game out there. 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.530
 chapters so there are more 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.530
 long 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:30.840
 so I 'll do each chapter 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:32.520
 no matter the size of it to stay 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.299
 more linear it became easier to follow the 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.460
 story 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:36.470
 the game is split while the roles on 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.630
 the game 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:42.810
 My god I played a little 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:44.729
 are 14 parts each time you have the eight 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.630
 chapters inside then make a chapter 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:48.149
 at time 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:50.310
 number five also follows the game 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:52.289
 and I'll focus on the playlist to stay in 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.479
 order when xinhua 

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:55.799
 But anyway I'll give or see here I'm going 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:57.869
 let the team run will not talk 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:00.060
 nothing to you see history're in 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:03.740
 Portuguese does not have everything to complain about ok 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:08.479
 so I'm going to click here you 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:08.479
 accompanies the karts written in history 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:15.690
 loading the cup 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:16.980
 click here came and followed this 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:19.460
 I'll stay quiet for you to hear. 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.460
 inside 

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:28.470
 I hope to succeed in this case. 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:32.150
 who wants to know 424 central 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:32.150
 check the head, why is that? 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:41.770
 we have shots fired from the roof that 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:44.610
 there is no moving one copy repeating 

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:44.610
 that there is no progress 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:05.140
 in 2005 have certain central 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:08.760
 units now open the police in 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:08.760
 first police danger prevented 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:21.620
 were all dead the last title was 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:23.450
 an exclamation point on everything that 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:25.910
 had happened so far 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:28.210
 I took my trigger finger and it was all 

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:28.210
 finished 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:32.960
 so this can make some sense 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:36.310
 I need to go back three years ago. 

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:36.310
 The night the pair started 

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:45.810
 AI apart from an American dream 

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:47.879
 I was still in the police station at the time. 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:50.120
 New York Police Central District 

00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:52.469
 north and abode the kitchen of hell 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:53.489
 So when you come to work for me? 

00:03:52.469 --> 00:03:55.170
 guarantees brook 

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:59.459
 you would make me work responsible 

00:03:55.170 --> 00:04:02.150
 augura any discovered the most suggests 

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:05.219
 see my last cigarette is bad for the woman 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:07.680
 always the old one subtle because when 

00:04:05.219 --> 00:04:09.510
 I see that even beyond shaking the 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:13.010
 The night staff is still standing except for 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:16.079
 of course you can count on me 

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:18.000
 life was good the substitute of the empire 

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:20.039
 of loyal or the smell of lawns 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.259
 newly hired sounds and children 

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:24.690
 playing a house by the river 

00:04:22.259 --> 00:04:26.970
 side of new jersey a stone wife and 

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:29.240
 a little girl the american dream has turned 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:29.240
 reality 

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:35.759
 In chÃ©ri I arrived but dreams have the 

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:37.410
 bad habit of becoming and nightmares 

00:04:35.759 --> 00:04:40.770
 when you least imagine 

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:43.020
 the sun was always arrogant 

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:50.909
 twilight slid through the heavens loaded 

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:53.940
 the predictions to ok then back was 

00:04:50.909 --> 00:04:55.860
 Pedro Pereira is the message I did not like 

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:57.419
 show's way started 

00:04:55.860 --> 00:05:00.030
 had given me the best control of the 

00:04:57.419 --> 00:05:03.420
 house in the middle of the first row 

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:04.920
 there beginning gambling here saying that the 

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:06.270
 mec hopes to have a great he has a 

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:08.670
 Bizarre face, right? 

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:11.010
 Finally the case of the time I think our 

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:13.170
 aid reaction and so done on the wall 

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:15.090
 an issue of things that is chubby 

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:18.950
 is an acronym for addicts the symbol 

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:18.950
 magician full of amorim meaning 

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:30.000
 you have to realize that the mech- 

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:35.070
 there is so it is a very confusing style 

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:37.380
 but it is quite dramatic so is the custom 

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:41.420
 mec will be wailing during the game 

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:44.220
 happy whole 

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:46.800
 Hear someone invaded my house and now 

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:49.800
 even for the police 

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:55.020
 Yes, someone invaded my house is here. 

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:59.490
 Do you need who's talking? 

00:05:55.020 --> 00:06:05.130
 Hello, I do not understand why there are people in the

 that has a mental odor 

00:07:17.050 --> 00:07:21.790
 was no more than in the 2000s. 

00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:23.710
 destroyed or snap the 

00:07:21.790 --> 00:07:24.700

00:07:23.710 --> 00:07:28.960
 synthetic 

00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:30.850

00:07:30.850 --> 00:07:36.040
 asking for transfer to the dr 

00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:38.290
 three years in order to achieve a 

00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:40.750
 In the case of Valdivia, there is finally 

00:07:38.290 --> 00:07:43.270
 three months gave the hint that 

00:07:40.750 --> 00:07:45.550
 jack lupino a mafioso family boss 

00:07:43.270 --> 00:07:47.670
