00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:04.720
 taylor 

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:10.580
 wild October 28, 2003 we are marianne thieme and of course we have that 

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:13.549
 has been enough 

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:17.880
 She knew that the first political party in the world was open that was not the short 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.150
 In the long term, people are more important but the importance of the animals 

00:00:21.839 --> 00:00:24.999
 nature and ignoring 

00:00:24.999 --> 00:00:27.820
 You can be the degree of civilization of a country 

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:31.669
 can be read by having the time at the congress with animals 

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:35.700
 a film about ten years strong for compassion and that matters 

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:40.860
 The network report that the party for the animals probably never in the second 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.020
 room will be there is still very deep in their heart to know I come 

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:46.790
 probably not in the second room 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:51.510
 those people are in favor of a damper immediately after the second parliamentary elections in 2003 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:52.760
 I received an email 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:54.780
 many people seek the writer 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.109
 and she wrote my voice was and is for the party for the animals 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:02.500
 and she came in contact with Kees van Kooten made the heart rudy stockings 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:04.570
 and the good 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:08.420
 has voted for a lot of publicity also finds 

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:13.300
 the other parties were not always waiting for this strange duck 

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:15.030
 in the bite 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.900
 the smallest party 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:19.320
 has the largest number of questions 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.620
 and the largest number of motions 

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:23.740
 they do what they have further 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:28.189
 I actually didn't perform anything at all because there was one later in the evening 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:31.320
 very much together 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.509
 very strong feeling that this part of the army 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.920
 all signs indicate this 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:37.350
 you see that people 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.590
 it no longer accept that you are no longer in 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.370
 but do what they want 

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:45.500
 at the same time human rights for animals 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:47.440
 with animal rights 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:51.210
 it is always true that people see the possibilities of slavery 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.530
 abolished years between charming thought but can not because was that kind 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:55.740
 economy together 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.150
 it stays that way 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:00.730
 the same applies to the giving of animal rights 

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:01.700
 the bulls 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:02.920
 give the opportunity 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:05.060
 display natural behavior 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:08.060
 probably nothing revolutionary at all 

00:02:09.379 --> 00:02:11.099
 a time in parliament 

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:13.379
 the party for the animals is present 

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:16.119
 taking action 

00:02:16.119 --> 00:02:18.679
 making documentaries 

00:02:18.679 --> 00:02:21.719
 and growing consciously for it 

00:02:21.719 --> 00:02:24.639
 the political tonya 

00:02:24.639 --> 00:02:28.410
 six months after more than two thirds of the second chamber agrees 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:30.519
 with a ban on slaughter without stunning 

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:33.109
 that is against the first room 

00:02:33.109 --> 00:02:36.109
 the party for the animals is sailing and the political course is underway 

00:02:36.619 --> 00:02:39.179
 even when it comes to condoms 

00:02:39.179 --> 00:02:42.179
 train ticket to whom 

00:02:43.219 --> 00:02:46.219
 furthermore, I believe that dialysis must end 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:50.579
 the hare in the marathon 

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:53.029
 who is a documentary from the nicolaas g pierson foundation
