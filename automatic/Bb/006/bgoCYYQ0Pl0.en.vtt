00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
 Oh, Doctor Rock, this fast I want. 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:09.480
 talk to you 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:12.200
 regarding the relationship between rice and 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:15.990
 diabetes is how rice can 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:20.189
 impact high blood glucose and 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:21.060
 runs the blood that has type diabetes 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.420
 1 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:37.790
 sergio type 2 and we have 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:41.340
 practically two types of rice rice 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:48.600
 integral part that maintains 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:50.670
 important features and a little bit 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.309
 of magnesium retains some minerals 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.590
 important and some vitamins also 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:58.590
 thing that does not happen in white rice is 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:02.850
 polished to lose these characteristics 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:09.170
 so we have practically two types 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:09.170
 of abuse is the rice white rice 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:33.479
 the question that I get enough in 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:44.570
 training and in my white blood the 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:52.770
 highest glycemic index integral control 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:55.259
 It's better not to want a 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:02:03.210
 meal of the day and monitors always 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:02:08.759
 put one hour after seeing the impact 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:13.780
 it would be very very patient 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:16.750
 the students of the uncontrolled project 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:19.209
 the increase of selic would be blood with 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:20.860
 white brown rice is much worse but 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:22.620
 It will take too takes a lot then you 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:25.660
 have to monitor glucose levels 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:27.430
 semed before eating and an hour later 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:30.760
 semed again with to rise 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:32.350
 much to prevent diabetes from having to 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:40.920
 be under control 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:40.920
 talk about controlled diabetes control 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:10.290
 two brothers 11 and 12 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:21.360
 if you are type 1 diabetic is to reduce in 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:21.360
 up to 83 percent the amount 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:25.930
 so this is it I'm staying here click 

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:28.329
 on a button in this video you meet 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:29.110
 best training special presentation 

00:03:28.329 --> 00:03:33.720
 for you
