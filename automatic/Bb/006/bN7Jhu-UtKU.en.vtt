00:02:38.839 --> 00:02:38.849 
change my mind a machine used to the f7

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:41.330 
change my mind a machine used to the f7
logo<00:02:39.269> because<00:02:39.599> it<00:02:39.930> looks<00:02:40.080> a<00:02:40.140> bit<00:02:40.200> nicer<00:02:40.560> so

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:47.850 
depth to about 60 the caps put on both

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:50.810 
depth to about 60 the caps put on both
Phillip<00:02:48.269> cap<00:02:48.480> and<00:02:48.720> for<00:02:49.470> the<00:02:49.560> radius<00:02:50.160> for<00:02:50.640> both

blast<00:03:21.350> put<00:03:22.350> the<00:03:22.440> quality<00:03:22.889> too<00:03:23.010> high<00:03:23.329> the<00:03:24.329> piece

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:24.630 
blast put the quality too high the piece

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:28.660 
blast put the quality too high the piece
is<00:03:24.660> to<00:03:24.989> 170<00:03:26.120> and<00:03:27.120> you<00:03:27.209> want<00:03:27.359> to<00:03:27.420> fracture<00:03:27.840> it

is to 170 and you want to fracture it

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:31.190 
is to 170 and you want to fracture it
now<00:03:29.670> at<00:03:29.819> the<00:03:29.940> bottom<00:03:30.180> left<00:03:30.690> hand<00:03:30.780> corner<00:03:30.959> you

now at the bottom left hand corner you

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:33.500 
now at the bottom left hand corner you
can<00:03:31.260> see<00:03:31.319> that's<00:03:31.590> fracturing<00:03:32.069> and<00:03:33.060> then<00:03:33.269> it's

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:33.510 
can see that's fracturing and then it's

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:35.599 
can see that's fracturing and then it's
done<00:03:33.900> now<00:03:34.859> what<00:03:34.980> you<00:03:35.010> want<00:03:35.190> to<00:03:35.250> do<00:03:35.400> is<00:03:35.489> you<00:03:35.519> want

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:00.180 
make this really weird tubes all around

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:02.000 
make this really weird tubes all around
it<00:06:00.360> don't<00:06:01.140> worry<00:06:01.289> about<00:06:01.410> that<00:06:01.560> it's<00:06:01.710> alright

all you got to do is turn the
radius<00:06:04.350> down<00:06:04.620> to<00:06:04.800> one<00:06:05.240> make<00:06:06.240> it<00:06:06.360> really<00:06:06.660> thin

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:07.460 
radius down to one make it really thin

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:10.640 
radius down to one make it really thin
change<00:06:08.460> the<00:06:08.610> strands<00:06:08.940> down<00:06:09.210> to<00:06:09.330> one<00:06:09.570> and<00:06:09.840> now

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:10.650 
change the strands down to one and now

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:12.140 
change the strands down to one and now
you've<00:06:10.770> got<00:06:10.860> all<00:06:10.950> these<00:06:11.070> wires<00:06:11.370> around<00:06:11.670> it<00:06:11.970> if

00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:12.150 
you've got all these wires around it if

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:13.400 
you've got all these wires around it if
you<00:06:12.360> want<00:06:12.570> you<00:06:12.660> can<00:06:12.870> make<00:06:13.050> it<00:06:13.170> a<00:06:13.230> little

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:13.410 
you want you can make it a little

00:06:13.410 --> 00:06:15.980 
you want you can make it a little
thicker<00:06:13.650> the<00:06:13.920> radius<00:06:14.250> not<00:06:15.120> to<00:06:15.390> fix<00:06:15.750> because

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:15.990 
thicker the radius not to fix because

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:17.330 
thicker the radius not to fix because
you<00:06:16.170> don't<00:06:16.290> want<00:06:16.350> it<00:06:16.590> doesn't<00:06:16.830> want<00:06:16.950> to<00:06:17.010> be<00:06:17.130> too

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:17.340 
you don't want it doesn't want to be too

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:18.890 
you don't want it doesn't want to be too
noticeable<00:06:17.520> it<00:06:17.970> just<00:06:18.150> wants<00:06:18.330> to<00:06:18.480> stand<00:06:18.660> out

00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:18.900 
noticeable it just wants to stand out

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:20.810 
noticeable it just wants to stand out
don't<00:06:19.680> stand<00:06:19.890> out<00:06:20.010> just<00:06:20.280> wants<00:06:20.430> to<00:06:20.520> be<00:06:20.640> there

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:20.820

don't stand out just wants to be there
so<00:06:21.600> you<00:06:21.690> going<00:06:21.780> to<00:06:21.840> drag<00:06:22.110> the<00:06:22.320> exact<00:06:22.620> same

00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:22.860 
so you going to drag the exact same

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:31.130 
it to the projection that you have got
another<00:06:27.750> one<00:06:28.940> and<00:06:29.940> there<00:06:30.150> you<00:06:30.240> go<00:06:30.390> you've<00:06:31.050> got

00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:31.140 
another one and there you go you've got

00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:32.930 
another one and there you go you've got
a<00:06:31.170> really<00:06:31.410> sick<00:06:31.680> logo<00:06:32.160> right<00:06:32.430> there<00:06:32.460> for<00:06:32.820> you

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:35.340 
and what we're going to do is we're

00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:38.090 
and what we're going to do is we're
actually<00:06:35.430> go<00:06:35.610> rotate<00:06:36.120> it<00:06:36.240> a<00:06:36.300> bit<00:06:36.590> so<00:06:37.590> it's<00:06:37.770> on

00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:38.100 
actually go rotate it a bit so it's on

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:41.600 
actually go rotate it a bit so it's on
an<00:06:38.190> angle<00:06:39.800> because<00:06:40.800> no<00:06:40.920> one<00:06:41.040> wants<00:06:41.250> a<00:06:41.280> straight

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:41.610 
an angle because no one wants a straight

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:45.110 
an angle because no one wants a straight
load<00:06:41.850> like<00:06:42.180> that<00:06:42.210> just<00:06:42.900> looks<00:06:43.140> boring<00:06:43.410> if<00:06:44.120> it's

00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:45.120 
load like that just looks boring if it's

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:46.760 
load like that just looks boring if it's
angled<00:06:45.750> or<00:06:45.870> something<00:06:46.260> it'll<00:06:46.410> look<00:06:46.500> she<00:06:46.620> looks

00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:46.770 
angled or something it'll look she looks

00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:48.960 
really nice so we're going to quickly do

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:53.780 
really nice so we're going to quickly do
a<00:06:48.990> render<00:06:50.510> see<00:06:51.510> what<00:06:51.630> it<00:06:51.720> looks<00:06:51.840> like<00:06:51.990> now<00:06:52.790> I

00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:53.790 
a render see what it looks like now I

00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:04.830 
in a lot of graphics design and lots of

00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:07.010 
in a lot of graphics design and lots of
people<00:07:05.070> actually<00:07:05.310> use<00:07:05.340> it<00:07:05.520> I<00:07:05.790> saw<00:07:06.150> it<00:07:06.180> from<00:07:06.600> a

I thought um you guys can also add a

00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:35.480 
I thought um you guys can also add a
couple<00:07:33.480> of<00:07:33.630> Reaper<00:07:33.990> X<00:07:34.170> around<00:07:34.590> the<00:07:34.740> sides<00:07:35.070> or

00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:35.490 
couple of Reaper X around the sides or

00:07:44.340 --> 00:07:46.550 
just going to show you an example of
what<00:07:44.490> I<00:07:44.520> mean<00:07:44.600> so<00:07:45.600> you<00:07:45.660> could<00:07:45.960> copy<00:07:46.230> another

00:07:46.550 --> 00:07:46.560 
what I mean so you could copy another

00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:50.750 
what I mean so you could copy another
Reaper<00:07:46.950> X<00:07:47.160> make<00:07:47.700> it<00:07:47.820> a<00:07:47.880> bit<00:07:48.000> bigger<00:07:49.310> and<00:07:50.310> then

00:07:50.750 --> 00:07:50.760 
Reaper X make it a bit bigger and then

00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:56.540 
Reaper X make it a bit bigger and then
drop<00:07:51.270> it<00:07:51.300> in<00:07:51.510> the<00:07:51.600> back

00:07:56.540 --> 00:07:56.550 

00:07:56.550 --> 00:08:01.570 

where<00:07:57.550> is<00:07:57.730> it

00:08:01.570 --> 00:08:01.580 

00:08:01.580 --> 00:08:03.879 

but<00:08:02.180> that's<00:08:02.750> probably<00:08:02.930> on<00:08:03.080> the<00:08:03.139> best<00:08:03.409> idea<00:08:03.740> but

00:08:03.879 --> 00:08:03.889 
but that's probably on the best idea but

00:08:03.889 --> 00:08:05.550 
but that's probably on the best idea but
maybe<00:08:03.979> since<00:08:04.220> through<00:08:04.430> our<00:08:04.520> seat<00:08:04.699> with<00:08:04.849> some

00:08:05.550 --> 00:08:05.560 
maybe since through our seat with some

00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:08.619 
maybe since through our seat with some
nice<00:08:06.789> squares<00:08:07.789> and<00:08:07.939> stuff<00:08:08.150> or<00:08:08.330> maybe<00:08:08.479> some

00:08:08.619 --> 00:08:08.629 
nice squares and stuff or maybe some

00:08:08.629 --> 00:08:10.360 
nice squares and stuff or maybe some
