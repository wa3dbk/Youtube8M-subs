00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:25.700
 I do not get it. This did not have to happen. 

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:27.900
 the pressure is rising. 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:28.400
 God! 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:29.320
 It hurt! 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:30.360
 Will your wife have the baby soon? 

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:31.760
 In about five weeks. 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:32.840
 You will be fine. 

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:34.420
 My baby! 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:35.137
 How is Abigail? 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:36.840
 I'm so sorry. 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:38.480
 she died at 7am 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:41.220
 No Abby. Tell me it's okay. 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.160
 Tell me it's okay! 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:45.713
 I swear to god! 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.720
 You'd better tell me it's okay right now. 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.260
 Mr. Haynes, I'll take you to see your daughter. 

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:54.720
 This is a respirator. 

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:56.320
 Her daughter still does not know how to breathe alone 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:57.780
 This is helping a little. 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:58.460
 I do not know you. 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:01.800
 A dam that has been broken. 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.040
 a category 4 hurricane 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:05.980
 Sir? I need you to go up. 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:06.680
 What's going on? 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:07.240
 come on we have to go 

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:08.940
 the levees broke. 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:10.680
 we must leave here 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:11.420
 the streets are flooded 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:12.280
 So we're stranded here? 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:14.960
 No, do not do this to me. 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.580
 nurse! 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:21.060
 the battery is old and has little charge. 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.720
 It will only last 3 minutes. 

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:28.160
 Everything will be fine, baby 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:31.560
 Soon you will breathe alone. 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:32.920
 I'm at Saint Mary's Hospital. 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:35.440
 I have a baby on a respirator that needs rescue 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:41.180
 Damn, it's a baby! 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:46.011
 Hey! Here! 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:48.530
 Wait! Come back! 

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:51.300
 I want you back. 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:57.700
 DESPERATE HOURS
