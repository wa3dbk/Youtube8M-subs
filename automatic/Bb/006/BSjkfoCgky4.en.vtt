 the first game in the sunlit future has fallen 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:17.589
 between ajax and 2 and outside fielder one 

00:00:17.589 --> 00:00:21.100
 Van Gaal wants his fault that Gordon scored well in the past 

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:23.939
 and then I stand on behalf of Buitenveldert 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:25.480
 rhine wood scores 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:28.859

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:33.180
 with the guests from outside fielder 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.499
 after all, the answer was from ajax 

00:00:35.499 --> 00:00:38.360
 this shot of this new missouri 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:41.950
 Bart is the ball can't hold a variant that hopefully is there like the chickens 

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:45.140
 and equalize 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:48.140
 the little man with the number eleven 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.180
 and Ajax went on 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:54.200
 with Christmas presents 

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:59.140
 from backward beware you always or well free and when i hit the ball 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:01.410
 so nice two seasons for ajax 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.410
 by the idea of ​​looking or 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:11.590
 then we are good disruptive work from ajax in the second half 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:15.300
 sabmiller tears 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:16.930
 sees the space on the left 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:19.180
 when initiating charges like 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:22.190
 the cash register broadcast bartels with the tanker 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:28.910
 and Ajax went ahead with captain wout goes on an adventure 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.660
 pretty solo 

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:36.860
 danny zoëy 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:38.920
 again in a syrup brass house 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:42.890
 the cash registers cross on shot shot and a good service from bing board 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:47.850
 here the picture tube is training, he sees it shortening here 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.960
 van der burgt 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:53.960
 Buitenveldert can't come out anymore and then it's wooden cross 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:57.020
 who records the DJ 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:58.110
 the captain 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.110
 believe that reason for ajax occurred 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:05.690
 that the economic area with another long shot bing the separation bar 

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:08.189
 turns and then fire of thielen 

00:02:08.189 --> 00:02:11.239
 it scores 4 a very viewed 

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:14.239
 three-piece burr 

00:02:14.889 --> 00:02:17.889
 and the team from the van went on 

00:02:19.789 --> 00:02:22.449
 that chaytor to a village 

00:02:22.449 --> 00:02:25.179
 but one by still 

00:02:25.179 --> 00:02:29.599
 Sittard Ice Cream wants to travel and that the five members are going 

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:31.609
 that was also the final score 

00:02:31.609 --> 00:02:35.039
 a nice victory on this sunny Saturday afternoon for the e2 

00:02:37.479 --> 00:02:41.139
 and then we go to the second game in the future in the hall ajax the one 

00:02:41.139 --> 00:02:44.139
 against a broadcast 

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:48.319
 ajax performs disruptively 

00:02:49.649 --> 00:02:54.489
 moral and then the violation free kick ajax behind the ball and the action it 

00:02:57.529 --> 00:02:59.629
 on dope de vries 

00:02:59.629 --> 00:03:02.899
 the devlies continue and the ball is taken off the line 

00:03:02.899 --> 00:03:05.899
 by goalkeeper demy and hfc stimulation 

00:03:11.539 --> 00:03:14.539
 then ajax over the left with kibri in every thiéry 

00:03:15.859 --> 00:03:19.009
 opening turn on gravenberch action 

00:03:19.009 --> 00:03:23.819
 shot with the left gave mountains but it then stimulates the rebound of every director 

00:03:25.639 --> 00:03:28.009
 that does not produce anything 

00:03:28.009 --> 00:03:29.519
 ajax the team 

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:32.519
 with the initiative 

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:37.989
 then the ball sometimes ends up with Jansen 

00:03:38.699 --> 00:03:41.699
 europe venture can't get through ing 

00:03:42.449 --> 00:03:46.709
 Both properties pass from backwards to knee highs is fast 

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:48.759
 offenses 

00:03:48.759 --> 00:03:51.759
 it will submit free kick ajax of course 

00:03:52.999 --> 00:03:55.739
 without a doubt 

00:03:55.739 --> 00:03:57.670
 steam to put down the wall 

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:01.040
 then and the action something with a free kick superb ball comes on the crossbar and also 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:04.319
 back through the large gate whatever the village can freeze on the bar 

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:07.319
 so let you kick 

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:10.549
 another free kick and the ball went backwards 

00:04:11.419 --> 00:04:16.519
 We see in this slo mo bad luck for Ajax against one and and the action to come 

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:19.519
 You can also see Frank the farmer from the sidelines 

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:24.289
 then a mistake of not taking this into their own chance 7 

00:04:25.199 --> 00:04:28.999
 competitor mark no problem for kelvin the grace the goalkeeper of the counter 

00:04:28.999 --> 00:04:29.949
 a 

00:04:29.949 --> 00:04:32.949
 analysts estimate away on the left 

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:36.330
 who blamed on speed 

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:38.789
 what is distributed below 

00:04:38.789 --> 00:04:41.789
 free kick for ajax 

00:04:43.009 --> 00:04:44.669
 BNn 

00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:47.710
 header from captain warmerdam at the second post 

00:04:48.469 --> 00:04:49.819
 it goes beside 

00:04:49.819 --> 00:04:52.789
 no more goals are scored and therefore the match ends between 

00:04:52.789 --> 00:04:55.289
 icing and that from the sea in a 0 0 draw
