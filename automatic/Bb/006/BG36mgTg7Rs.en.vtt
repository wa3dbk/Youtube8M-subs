00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
work on getting those because those are

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.469 
work on getting those because those are
both<00:01:46.560> really<00:01:47.040> really<00:01:47.579> nice<00:01:47.820> pro<00:01:48.060> perks<00:01:48.270> to

marathon<00:01:51.659> was<00:01:52.020> not<00:01:52.470> necessary<00:01:52.979> but<00:01:53.189> really

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
marathon was not necessary but really

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.850 
marathon was not necessary but really
something<00:01:54.030> i<00:01:54.090> like<00:01:54.240> to<00:01:54.479> use<00:01:54.509> when<00:01:55.350> i<00:01:55.380> am<00:01:55.590> using

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
something i like to use when i am using

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.399 
something i like to use when i am using
the<00:01:56.399> MPL<00:01:56.909> and<00:01:57.210> i<00:01:57.329> want<00:01:57.509> a<00:01:57.540> rush<00:01:57.780> i<00:01:58.049> can<00:01:58.200> mean<00:01:58.380> a

the MPL and i want a rush i can mean a

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
high rate of fire and the slightly

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.770

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
larger clip size of the npl did some

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.469 
larger clip size of the npl did some
serious<00:02:04.020> damage<00:02:04.259> done<00:02:04.740> on<00:02:05.159> the<00:02:05.369> enemies<00:02:05.790> what

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
serious damage done on the enemies what

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:07.910 
serious damage done on the enemies what
I<00:02:06.509> will<00:02:06.689> say<00:02:06.719> though<00:02:07.049> is<00:02:07.079> if<00:02:07.409> you<00:02:07.560> decide<00:02:07.890> not

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
I will say though is if you decide not

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.339 
I will say though is if you decide not
to<00:02:08.310> go<00:02:08.340> with<00:02:08.489> scavenger<00:02:09.300> or<00:02:09.330> hardline<00:02:10.050> two

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
to go with scavenger or hardline two

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:11.440 
to go with scavenger or hardline two
things<00:02:10.590> that<00:02:10.830> would

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:11.450 
things that would

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:13.690 
things that would
allow<00:02:11.690> you<00:02:11.750> to<00:02:12.170> probably<00:02:13.129> get<00:02:13.370> up<00:02:13.489> to<00:02:13.610> those

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:13.700 
allow you to probably get up to those

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:14.800 
allow you to probably get up to those
higher<00:02:13.910> killstreaks<00:02:14.330> a<00:02:14.390> little<00:02:14.569> bit<00:02:14.660> easier

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810 
higher killstreaks a little bit easier

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:17.290 
higher killstreaks a little bit easier
because<00:02:15.140> you<00:02:15.230> have<00:02:15.440> more<00:02:15.650> ammo<00:02:16.150> definitely<00:02:17.150> go

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:17.300 
because you have more ammo definitely go

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:19.600 
because you have more ammo definitely go
with<00:02:17.330> dual<00:02:17.900> mags<00:02:18.110> oh<00:02:18.440> and<00:02:18.800> excuse<00:02:19.190> me<00:02:19.340> I<00:02:19.370> know

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:19.610 
with dual mags oh and excuse me I know

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:20.860 
with dual mags oh and excuse me I know
hardline<00:02:20.090> doesn't<00:02:20.330> actually<00:02:20.420> give<00:02:20.629> you<00:02:20.690> more

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:20.870 
hardline doesn't actually give you more

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:23.170 
hardline doesn't actually give you more
ammo<00:02:21.140> but<00:02:21.349> it<00:02:21.440> just<00:02:21.590> requires<00:02:21.920> less<00:02:22.160> kills<00:02:22.459> to

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:23.180 
ammo but it just requires less kills to

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:25.390 
ammo but it just requires less kills to
get<00:02:23.330> to<00:02:23.510> your<00:02:23.690> killstreaks<00:02:24.230> so<00:02:24.950> yeah<00:02:25.190> I

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:25.400 
get to your killstreaks so yeah I

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:26.740 
get to your killstreaks so yeah I
definitely<00:02:25.670> recommend<00:02:25.940> you<00:02:26.209> go<00:02:26.330> dual<00:02:26.599> mags

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:26.750 
definitely recommend you go dual mags

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:29.290 
definitely recommend you go dual mags

have many advantages over the other ones

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:36.750 
have many advantages over the other ones
in<00:02:34.190> the<00:02:34.220> games<00:02:34.489> like<00:02:34.760> the<00:02:34.880> aks-74u<00:02:35.750> or<00:02:36.410> the

in the games like the aks-74u or the

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:39.759 
in the games like the aks-74u or the

00:02:39.759 --> 00:02:39.769 
spectre but it is a nice gun to use to

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:41.020 
spectre but it is a nice gun to use to

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.030 
get a little bit of variety every once

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:42.729 
get a little bit of variety every once
in<00:02:41.180> a<00:02:41.239> while<00:02:41.420> and<00:02:41.690> it<00:02:41.989> certainly<00:02:42.170> isn't<00:02:42.530> a

00:02:42.729 --> 00:02:42.739 
in a while and it certainly isn't a

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:44.500 
in a while and it certainly isn't a
terrible<00:02:43.160> gun<00:02:43.340> like<00:02:43.580> some<00:02:44.090> people<00:02:44.390> might

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:44.510 
terrible gun like some people might

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:46.210 
terrible gun like some people might
stigmatize<00:02:45.170> it<00:02:45.319> to<00:02:45.440> be<00:02:45.560> so<00:02:45.830> that's<00:02:46.069> what<00:02:46.190> i

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:46.220 
stigmatize it to be so that's what i

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:48.100 
stigmatize it to be so that's what i
will<00:02:46.370> say<00:02:46.400> about<00:02:46.760> it<00:02:46.940> my<00:02:47.599> killstreaks<00:02:47.810> for

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:48.110 
will say about it my killstreaks for

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:50.319 
will say about it my killstreaks for
this<00:02:48.200> gameplay<00:02:48.440> we're<00:02:49.400> a<00:02:49.430> little<00:02:49.730> bit<00:02:49.910> high<00:02:50.090> i

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:50.329 
this gameplay we're a little bit high i

00:02:50.329 --> 00:02:52.300 
this gameplay we're a little bit high i
think<00:02:50.540> i<00:02:50.599> was<00:02:50.720> using<00:02:50.900> the<00:02:51.170> the<00:02:51.590> UAV<00:02:51.980> the

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:17.900 
happened i guess you could say i'm not

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:19.660

exactly<00:05:18.230> sure<00:05:18.380> how<00:05:18.650> it<00:05:18.770> works<00:05:18.950> I<00:05:19.190> think<00:05:19.580> my

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:19.670 
exactly sure how it works I think my

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:20.890 
exactly sure how it works I think my
insurance<00:05:19.880> rates<00:05:20.120> are<00:05:20.300> probably<00:05:20.600> going<00:05:20.720> to<00:05:20.810> go

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:20.900 
insurance rates are probably going to go

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:22.810 
insurance rates are probably going to go
up<00:05:21.080> just<00:05:21.380> cuz<00:05:21.500> the<00:05:21.620> fact<00:05:21.800> that<00:05:21.860> I'm<00:05:22.010> 17<00:05:22.520> and<00:05:22.550> I

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:22.820 
up just cuz the fact that I'm 17 and I

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:24.490 
up just cuz the fact that I'm 17 and I
got<00:05:22.970> into<00:05:23.120> an<00:05:23.240> accident<00:05:23.360> regardless<00:05:23.870> of<00:05:24.350> whose

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:24.500 
got into an accident regardless of whose

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:26.530

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:26.540 
fault it was but I guess that's just

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:28.870 
fault it was but I guess that's just
something<00:05:26.750> I<00:05:26.930> kind<00:05:27.050> of<00:05:27.140> have<00:05:27.260> to<00:05:27.290> deal<00:05:27.560> with<00:05:27.880> so
