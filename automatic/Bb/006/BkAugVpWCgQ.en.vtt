try to almost pitch my leg in the
background<00:02:54.000> either<00:02:57.380> now<00:02:58.380> there<00:02:58.890> should<00:02:59.010> be

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.130 
background either now there should be

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:11.720 
background either now there should be
rotation<00:02:59.670> to<00:02:59.760> the<00:02:59.850> body<00:03:10.010> so<00:03:11.010> if<00:03:11.100> it's<00:03:11.250> all<00:03:11.400> on

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
rotation to the body so if it's all on

rotation to the body so if it's all on
the<00:03:11.880> Florida<00:03:12.270> practices<00:03:12.840> per<00:03:13.020> second<00:03:13.380> you<00:03:13.860> do

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
the Florida practices per second you do

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:14.979 
the Florida practices per second you do
one<00:03:14.220> thing

00:03:14.979 --> 00:03:14.989 
one thing

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:18.890 
one thing
Tony<00:03:15.989> beets<00:03:16.940> that<00:03:17.940> no<00:03:18.060> separation<00:03:18.570> will<00:03:18.870> be

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:18.900 
Tony beets that no separation will be

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:20.600 
Tony beets that no separation will be
the<00:03:19.080> techniques<00:03:19.530> first<00:03:19.770> I'll<00:03:20.010> show<00:03:20.160> the<00:03:20.400> beads

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:20.610 
the techniques first I'll show the beads

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:23.780 
the techniques first I'll show the beads
on<00:03:20.790> there<00:03:20.970> so<00:03:21.720> you're<00:03:21.930> gonna<00:03:22.050> afford<00:03:22.640> to<00:03:23.640> for

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
on there so you're gonna afford to for

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:25.430 
on there so you're gonna afford to for
the<00:03:23.880> guys<00:03:24.030> to<00:03:24.270> know<00:03:24.300> how<00:03:24.510> to<00:03:24.570> leave<00:03:24.810> this<00:03:24.959> are

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.440 
the guys to know how to leave this are

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:27.290 
the guys to know how to leave this are
so<00:03:25.650> to<00:03:25.860> do<00:03:26.010> this<00:03:26.160> technique<00:03:26.580> is<00:03:26.700> will<00:03:26.850> take<00:03:27.030> so

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:27.300 
so to do this technique is will take so

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:29.720 
so to do this technique is will take so
my<00:03:27.840> weights<00:03:28.020> for<00:03:28.380> I'm<00:03:29.010> going<00:03:29.160> to<00:03:29.220> transfer<00:03:29.700> it

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:29.730 
my weights for I'm going to transfer it

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:32.780 
my weights for I'm going to transfer it
back<00:03:30.000> onto<00:03:30.450> my<00:03:30.780> lap<00:03:31.459> rotating<00:03:32.459> through<00:03:32.640> my

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:32.790 
back onto my lap rotating through my

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:36.530 
back onto my lap rotating through my
Center<00:03:33.269> here<00:03:33.630> and<00:03:33.900> throw
