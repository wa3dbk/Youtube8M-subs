00:00:00.999 --> 00:00:05.629
 lieke sievers is staff member and organization of the nvbr 

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:10.220
 its portfolio also includes the safe public task program 

00:00:11.159 --> 00:00:14.159
 what is the core of the program according to lieke 

00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:20.609
 core of the program is tourist information and addressing those issues that have to do 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:22.369
 with violence used against 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:26.029
 social workers with a public task but that is not only fire became the ghost 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:29.199
 police ambulance staff it's about everything 

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:34.000
 all people who work for the government to provide assistance to people of their own 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.589
 face violence 

00:00:35.589 --> 00:00:38.589
 on the street 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:45.560
 it is important in the first instance that we pay attention to the phenomenon we 

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:48.020
 with the part of society in which 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:52.330
 using violence is receiving more and more attention but it is also the intention 

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:55.830
 to set the stake and we must act as emergency services 

00:00:55.830 --> 00:01:00.200
 and already making it clear that we are not accepting violence against us over one 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:10.550
 this action is a problem but as far as I am concerned it is then and 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:12.550
 social problem it is not just a problem of 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:13.960
 emergency services 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:15.770
 and that is why it requires ours 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:19.810
 more than just going repressive can tackle the problem from the back 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:21.540
 when it has already happened 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.110
 we will also subject each other in particular 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:27.850
 he pinned his own forces and had to make it negotiable at national level 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:32.410
 provide information about it and ensure that we discuss it by paying attention 

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:36.180
 we make clear our boundaries that we also like each other better 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.490
 social workers that we simply do not accept 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:42.409
 what want from our managerial questions 

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:45.890
 to radiate towards our employees 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:48.890
 that we also help them to set those limits and make them clear on the street 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:57.450
 what that remains our figures 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:58.350
 is that it 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.360
 I wanted 40 percent of the 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:03.730
 respondents with us 

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:06.810
 verbal abuse the west face verbal abuse 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.830
 and around 8 percent of the operator people face threats 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.149
 contain physical violence 

00:02:12.149 --> 00:02:15.149
 and secretly to the savings port 

00:02:20.429 --> 00:02:21.569
 at the turn of the year 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:24.700
 pray in any case get a good view of what it is really going on 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:29.260
 points the major incidents are of course immediately taken from the media 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.149
 expires last year's turn in culemborg happened 

00:02:32.149 --> 00:02:36.119
 but that happens therefore a familiar in the rest of the country even more and the world 

00:02:36.119 --> 00:02:37.769
 get a good view 

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:41.910
 what people do not find it easy to report the internet many cases 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:45.370
 So what we want to encourage is that in those cases that justifies it 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:46.999
 give that to happen 

00:02:46.999 --> 00:02:50.139
 and conversations about that are open with all forces 

00:02:50.139 --> 00:02:53.439
 and so knowing what to share after the New Year is a good view 

00:02:53.439 --> 00:02:56.789
 on the actual incidents that have occurred 

00:02:56.789 --> 00:02:58.029
 based on 

00:02:58.029 --> 00:03:01.029
 be able to tighten our policy again 

00:03:05.469 --> 00:03:08.229
 and even follow fire and strategy, then he leaves again 

00:03:08.229 --> 00:03:09.290
 prepared 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:13.150
 with the national program safe public task in which all 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:17.340
 emergency services and also about other government services 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:21.670
 to make a fist against violence against aid workers 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:23.919
 against civil servants with a public task 

00:03:23.919 --> 00:03:28.739
 and the things that we and there as the fire brigade are taking are among others 

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:34.059
 support from the help desk vpv secure public task in the 

00:03:34.059 --> 00:03:38.119
 claiming back damage but the damage was caused by the force used 

00:03:38.119 --> 00:03:40.539
 but also for example 

00:03:40.539 --> 00:03:42.559
 further development of a program 

00:03:42.559 --> 00:03:46.429
 to make that anonymous declaration possible that was called protected declaration 

00:03:46.429 --> 00:03:51.019
 do it because often there is a high threshold he does because you know you 

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:54.180
 name through the lawyers and well known well there we want too 

00:03:55.599 --> 00:03:57.629
 talking about it and trying to change that
