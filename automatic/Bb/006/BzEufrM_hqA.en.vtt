00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.220
 in this video I'm a lot on the spot 

00:00:02.659 --> 00:00:22.439
 doing is alone by monsters 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:24.689
 and pray for the temple of apple so today we 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.789
 doing long exposures is 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:31.279
 especially by the way if you don't like 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:35.760
 short excerpts about this this 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:38.520
 look here so many innovations 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:41.120
 immediately there was no and at the same time he became so 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.120
 much easier 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:54.300
 that's how much money apple rakes 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:58.469
 they are all there yes today we are taking pictures with 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:01:00.359
 long exposure so yes in general 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:01.680
 first thing you should try when 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:05.010
 long exposure 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:08.189
 smooth the sky clouds and all kinds of clouds there 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:10.380
 or sea unfortunately clouds today 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:12.390
 boring you really can not see their meaning 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.520
 they have no watch there especially 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.100
 nothing so today we will look 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.570
 do not complain 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:20.549
 long exposure allows you to do so 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.500
 to the movement of clouds or waves of the sea 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:24.299
 looked unnaturally long exposure 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.250
 necessary because the clouds and the sea are not 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:27.900
 very moving very much the same 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.630
 can be done with people but in this case 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:33.280
 so long exposure is not necessary 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:37.409
 so for long exposure photography to us 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:41.409
 Of course you need the camera itself and the lens and 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:44.799
 still tripod you need a good durable 

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:46.509
 tripod me broken when you 

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:48.399
 choose a tripod try to kick it 

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:50.049
 soccer ball i heard it 

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:53.229
 time tested strength test 

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:54.969
 why do we need a reliable tripod then what do we need 

00:01:53.229 --> 00:02:01.350
 do not need a kinetic picture 

00:01:54.969 --> 00:02:06.369
 but this thing is just the size oh no 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:08.649
 this is repeated again as it was possible 

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:10.750
 tread on the same rake twice forget 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:12.819
 anything in the procession is very simple 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:14.260
 which we did last time 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:17.349
 gathered to shoot on long exposure 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:19.420
 damn I forgot to take the remote unfortunately I 

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:20.560
 forgot to take the trigger remote he would strongly 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:22.599
 simplified our task 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:24.370
 normal people use ball pressure 

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:26.200
 I now have to constantly keep 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:29.950
 your finger on the shutter button and 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:34.420
 the camera will shake it must be removed 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:37.079
 Well, of course now I will not 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:39.760
 just keep your finger on the shutter 

00:02:37.079 --> 00:02:41.590
 but also keep the filter in place 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:43.600
 for holding the shutter button and 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:47.639
 light filter should give medals but 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:47.639
 This time it was not so bad as 

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:57.910
 money goes back to cupertino you 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:59.560
 just look i did take with 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:02.049
 a remote now I do not have to 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:03.400
 constantly push here and 30 tripod so 

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:05.739
 do not forget to take this 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:09.099
 gizmo or the one who reminds you 

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:14.040
 take it with you and so we have a tripod 

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:16.750
 camera and lens like that song 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:19.419
 camera lenses tripod knees and 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:21.940
 socks knees and socks camera 

00:03:19.419 --> 00:03:23.859
 lenses tripod knees and socks but 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:26.859
 we need to add something else because 

00:03:23.859 --> 00:03:28.780
 that we have already 16 and 150 and excerpt 

00:03:26.859 --> 00:03:31.419
 still not long enough need 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:34.540
 make it even longer and for that 

00:03:31.419 --> 00:03:36.160
 I have this look here 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:38.390
 a moment of magic 

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:46.630
 I didn't have them in my hands 

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:49.760
 and here you do not see them again 

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:50.470
 this is the ceiling fanboys your gig in 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:59.540
 the sti 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:04:04.270
 photograph applestore oh the thing is 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:04.270
 that taking pictures of moving people 

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:08.959
 especially with this kind of lighting you don't 

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:10.790
 need so long shutter speed on 

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:12.830
 long exposures need more light 

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:15.020
 that objects appear enough 

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:16.880
 clearly if they will keep in the map 

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:24.080
 like decapitated chicken then you 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:25.730
 most likely you won't see them at all and we 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:27.950
 decided to show you what they look like 

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:30.680
 moving people in frame with very long 

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:33.800
 excerpted this this is like new york just not 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:36.050
 new york you can do so 

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:38.300
 people around disappeared and you were surrounded by clubs 

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:40.669
 vanilla haze like if you were getting fed up 

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:43.040
 psychotropic drugs I put 

00:04:40.669 --> 00:04:45.229
 endurance at random for one minute and now 

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:47.470
 it is necessary to stand up so the hand is already beginning 

00:04:45.229 --> 00:04:47.470
 to flow 

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:53.850
 but 

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:03.450
 I think it was a bit boring as 

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:07.960
 you think there are no people there 

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:11.230
 let's put there someone about lang 

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:16.500
 there would be on lambie aside with us 

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:19.500
 there is al-Anbiya is very handy ready 

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:19.500
 ok 

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:33.790
 when exposure is calculated in minutes 

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:35.380
 flash will be very useful because 

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:38.170
 the model cannot stand anyway 

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:40.720
 still so long we shoot here 

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:44.170
 small scary movie now lambie theme she 

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:45.810
 yet it has not turned yet it 

00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:47.800
 normal lambie 

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:53.760
 stay scared and I'm closer now 

00:05:47.800 --> 00:06:05.350
 I'll go get closer to the lens 

00:05:53.760 --> 00:06:08.370
 get ready go oh hell I'm what's true 

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:08.370
 I look so scary 

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:18.610
 Perhaps today is the best frame on 

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:21.040
 this fun note we rounded out chao 

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:22.750
 long exposure and flash together can 

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:24.910
 give cool effects if you highlight 

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:26.680
 posing model u well what abstruse 

00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:28.690
 words - stand still while people 

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:30.700
 around you are blurred in motion with 

00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:32.380
 flash your camera appear like 

00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:34.360
 two separate shutter flash 

00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:36.580
 freezes objects and real shutter 

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:41.050
 lubricates everything else it's some kind 

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:43.330
 ghost down you can get 

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:43.930
 truly creative or hipster 

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:45.640
 snapshots 

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:47.830
 you can even use these tricks 

00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:49.750
 experiment for street photography 

00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:52.030
 so when you are at the beginning or at the end 

00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:56.130
 excerpts try moving the camera itself during 

00:06:52.030 --> 00:06:56.130
 shooting time or zoom lens 

00:06:57.750 --> 00:07:02.410
 here are such small useful things 

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:04.540
 you can try it yourself in advance 

00:07:02.410 --> 00:07:06.820
 live from these holidays period when 

00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:09.100
 hong kong outside and inside is decorated with the most 

00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:11.260
 use magic lighting to 

00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:13.600
 creativity all these fireworks and fire and 

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:15.850
 all that happens on the background take with 

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:16.840
 a flash and experiment with 

00:07:15.850 --> 00:07:21.090
 New Year 

00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:21.090
 unless you watch it in the summer
