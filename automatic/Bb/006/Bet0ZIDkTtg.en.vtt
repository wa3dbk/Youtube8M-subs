00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:02.220 
this is a tutorial on how to draw 3d

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:05.090 
this is a tutorial on how to draw 3d
chalk<00:00:02.460> drawings<00:00:03.000> the<00:00:03.959> concept<00:00:04.470> of<00:00:04.650> this<00:00:04.859> art

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:05.100 
chalk drawings the concept of this art

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:07.070 
chalk drawings the concept of this art
form<00:00:05.370> is<00:00:05.549> an<00:00:05.670> illusion<00:00:06.150> kind<00:00:06.629> of<00:00:06.690> like<00:00:06.810> saying

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:07.080 
form is an illusion kind of like saying

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:08.990 
form is an illusion kind of like saying
from<00:00:07.259> a<00:00:07.379> mirror<00:00:07.710> you<00:00:08.250> think<00:00:08.550> the<00:00:08.670> light<00:00:08.849> is

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:09.000 
from a mirror you think the light is

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.339 
from a mirror you think the light is
coming<00:00:09.179> from<00:00:09.360> the<00:00:09.599> mirror<00:00:09.840> but<00:00:10.050> in<00:00:10.170> reality

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:10.349 
coming from the mirror but in reality

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:13.039 
coming from the mirror but in reality
it's<00:00:10.889> coming<00:00:11.250> from<00:00:11.370> elsewhere<00:00:11.880> the<00:00:12.599> audience

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
it's coming from elsewhere the audience

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:15.169 
it's coming from elsewhere the audience
should<00:00:13.380> see<00:00:13.620> with<00:00:13.860> one<00:00:14.099> eye<00:00:14.130> because<00:00:14.580> with<00:00:14.969> two

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
should see with one eye because with two

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:16.910 
should see with one eye because with two
eyes<00:00:15.360> he<00:00:15.599> can<00:00:15.750> tell<00:00:15.960> exactly<00:00:16.289> where<00:00:16.650> the<00:00:16.770> light

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
eyes he can tell exactly where the light

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.740 
eyes he can tell exactly where the light
is<00:00:16.949> coming<00:00:17.100> from<00:00:17.400> which<00:00:18.090> would<00:00:18.359> form<00:00:18.660> an

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
is coming from which would form an

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.650 
is coming from which would form an
illusion<00:00:19.199> if<00:00:19.770> you<00:00:20.580> studied<00:00:20.939> light<00:00:21.150> in<00:00:21.270> physics

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
illusion if you studied light in physics

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.179 
illusion if you studied light in physics
you<00:00:21.960> should<00:00:22.170> know<00:00:22.320> about<00:00:22.470> the<00:00:22.769> illusions

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
you should know about the illusions

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.910 
you should know about the illusions
concept<00:00:23.789> and<00:00:24.029> how<00:00:24.210> humans<00:00:24.660> see<00:00:24.720> things<00:00:25.170> this

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
concept and how humans see things this

concept and how humans see things this
guy<00:00:26.189> wants<00:00:26.550> to<00:00:26.609> see<00:00:26.880> the<00:00:27.000> object<00:00:28.400> this<00:00:29.400> object

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
guy wants to see the object this object

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:34.069 
guy wants to see the object this object
here<00:00:30.210> so<00:00:30.929> to<00:00:30.990> trick<00:00:31.470> him<00:00:31.710> to<00:00:32.610> seeing<00:00:32.940> the<00:00:33.210> so

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
here so to trick him to seeing the so

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.709 
here so to trick him to seeing the so
seeing<00:00:34.410> if<00:00:34.620> as<00:00:35.160> the<00:00:35.460> object<00:00:35.910> was<00:00:36.210> coming<00:00:36.600> from

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
seeing if as the object was coming from

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:39.350 
seeing if as the object was coming from
here<00:00:36.989> the<00:00:37.410> light<00:00:37.649> ray<00:00:38.219> needs<00:00:38.670> to<00:00:38.940> seem<00:00:39.180> like

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
here the light ray needs to seem like

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.110 
here the light ray needs to seem like
it's<00:00:39.660> coming<00:00:40.140> from<00:00:40.290> the<00:00:40.530> real<00:00:41.129> objects<00:00:41.790> point

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
it's coming from the real objects point

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.950 
it's coming from the real objects point
here<00:00:42.420> to<00:00:42.600> find<00:00:43.530> that<00:00:43.710> spot<00:00:44.040> in<00:00:44.190> this<00:00:44.340> diagram

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:44.960 
here to find that spot in this diagram

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:49.729 
here to find that spot in this diagram
extend<00:00:45.960> the<00:00:46.200> fake<00:00:46.680> light<00:00:47.219> ray<00:00:47.460> here<00:00:48.739> extend

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
extend the fake light ray here extend

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:54.889 
extend the fake light ray here extend
this<00:00:49.950> light<00:00:50.190> ray<00:00:51.559> and<00:00:53.390> where<00:00:54.390> it<00:00:54.510> hits<00:00:54.719> the

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
this light ray and where it hits the

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:58.459 
this light ray and where it hits the
ground<00:00:55.170> is<00:00:55.559> it<00:00:56.399> this<00:00:56.850> is<00:00:57.090> where<00:00:57.360> the<00:00:57.660> illusion

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
ground is it this is where the illusion

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:02.930 
ground is it this is where the illusion
should<00:00:58.859> be<00:00:59.010> drawn<00:00:59.870> here<00:01:01.460> so<00:01:02.460> this<00:01:02.699> is<00:01:02.910> the

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
should be drawn here so this is the

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:08.289 
should be drawn here so this is the
illusion<00:01:05.479> now<00:01:06.479> the<00:01:06.540> same<00:01:06.990> thing<00:01:07.290> is<00:01:07.500> with

00:01:08.289 --> 00:01:08.299 
illusion now the same thing is with

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:11.929 
illusion now the same thing is with
illusions<00:01:09.299> under<00:01:09.780> the<00:01:09.930> surface<00:01:10.700> let's<00:01:11.700> say

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
illusions under the surface let's say

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.330 
illusions under the surface let's say
you<00:01:12.000> wanted<00:01:12.479> to<00:01:12.630> draw<00:01:12.900> a<00:01:13.200> point<00:01:13.860> from<00:01:14.040> here

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
you wanted to draw a point from here

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.310 
you wanted to draw a point from here
then<00:01:14.970> you<00:01:15.210> would<00:01:15.799> draw<00:01:16.799> a<00:01:16.830> light<00:01:17.280> ray<00:01:17.549> from

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:18.320 
then you would draw a light ray from

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:22.160 
then you would draw a light ray from
here<00:01:19.320> to<00:01:19.470> here<00:01:19.680> so<00:01:20.330> where<00:01:21.330> it<00:01:21.570> meets<00:01:21.840> the

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
here to here so where it meets the

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:28.940 
here to here so where it meets the
ground<00:01:22.850> is<00:01:24.619> where<00:01:26.720> this<00:01:27.720> light<00:01:28.500> ray<00:01:28.710> is

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
ground is where this light ray is

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.010 
ground is where this light ray is
supposed<00:01:29.340> to<00:01:29.430> be<00:01:29.640> coming<00:01:29.970> from<00:01:30.000> so<00:01:30.780> you<00:01:30.810> can

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
supposed to be coming from so you can

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.690 
supposed to be coming from so you can
draw<00:01:31.439> this<00:01:31.770> point<00:01:32.100> on<00:01:32.400> the<00:01:32.700> surface<00:01:32.880> at<00:01:33.270> here

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:34.700 
draw this point on the surface at here

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:38.890 
draw this point on the surface at here
now<00:01:35.700> there<00:01:36.240> are<00:01:36.390> two<00:01:36.540> rules<00:01:37.430> for<00:01:38.430> the<00:01:38.520> illusion

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:38.900 
now there are two rules for the illusion

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:41.840 
now there are two rules for the illusion
the<00:01:39.900> rule<00:01:40.110> number<00:01:40.350> one<00:01:40.680> is<00:01:40.920> to<00:01:40.950> see<00:01:41.460> with<00:01:41.640> only

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
the rule number one is to see with only

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.810 
the rule number one is to see with only
one<00:01:42.150> eye<00:01:42.500> rule<00:01:43.500> number<00:01:43.710> two<00:01:44.009> is<00:01:44.040> the<00:01:44.640> object

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
one eye rule number two is the object

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.969 
one eye rule number two is the object
you're<00:01:45.240> drawing<00:01:45.540> cannot<00:01:46.020> be<00:01:46.290> higher<00:01:46.560> than<00:01:46.829> the

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
you're drawing cannot be higher than the

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:52.940 
you're drawing cannot be higher than the
person<00:01:47.399> who's<00:01:47.610> seen<00:01:47.909> the<00:01:48.750> object<00:01:51.170> in<00:01:52.170> part<00:01:52.740> two

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
person who's seen the object in part two

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.460 
person who's seen the object in part two
I'll<00:01:53.250> explain<00:01:53.790> how<00:01:54.030> to<00:01:54.090> make<00:01:54.180> a<00:01:54.630> 3d<00:01:54.780> chalk

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
I'll explain how to make a 3d chalk

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:00.560 
I'll explain how to make a 3d chalk
drawing<00:01:55.829> of<00:01:55.950> your<00:01:56.070> own<00:01:56.990> except<00:01:57.990> for<00:01:58.140> on<00:01:58.259> paper
