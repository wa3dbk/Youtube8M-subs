00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
people seem to on TV enjoy a lot that

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:35.990 
people seem to on TV enjoy a lot that
all<00:01:34.710> started<00:01:35.070> really<00:01:35.310> with<00:01:35.400> law<00:01:35.610> and<00:01:35.759> order

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
all started really with law and order

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.560 
all started really with law and order
right<00:01:36.210> that<00:01:37.170> seems<00:01:37.470> to<00:01:37.619> be<00:01:37.799> now<00:01:38.060> the<00:01:39.060> blueprint

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
right that seems to be now the blueprint

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.460 
right that seems to be now the blueprint
for<00:01:39.750> almost<00:01:39.990> every<00:01:40.380> crime<00:01:40.740> or<00:01:41.899> series<00:01:42.899> on<00:01:43.079> TV

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470

for almost every crime or series on TV
so<00:01:44.280> a<00:01:44.670> kind<00:01:45.270> of<00:01:45.329> droop<00:01:45.630> I<00:01:45.810> think<00:01:46.020> it<00:01:46.110> drew<00:01:46.320> them

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
so a kind of droop I think it drew them

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.830
