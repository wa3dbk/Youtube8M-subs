preview<00:00:07.470> now<00:00:07.710> this<00:00:07.890> is<00:00:08.130> scene<00:00:08.519> one<00:00:08.990> from<00:00:09.990> the

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290 
preview now this is scene one from the

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.520 
preview now this is scene one from the
second<00:00:10.950> episode<00:00:11.010> of<00:00:11.309> abnormality<00:00:11.969> and<00:00:12.570> so

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
second episode of abnormality and so

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.400 
second episode of abnormality and so
it's<00:00:13.830> pretty<00:00:14.070> much<00:00:14.280> in<00:00:14.549> the<00:00:14.929> anaglyph<00:00:15.929> format

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
it's pretty much in the anaglyph format

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.650 
it's pretty much in the anaglyph format
i<00:00:16.440> guess<00:00:16.710> so<00:00:16.949> you<00:00:17.010> will<00:00:17.220> need<00:00:17.369> a<00:00:17.580> pair<00:00:17.940> of<00:00:17.970> red

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
i guess so you will need a pair of red

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.560 
i guess so you will need a pair of red
and<00:00:18.930> cyan<00:00:19.230> glasses<00:00:20.189> to<00:00:20.340> watch<00:00:20.490> this<00:00:20.789> now<00:00:21.180> it<00:00:21.420> is

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
and cyan glasses to watch this now it is

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.689 
and cyan glasses to watch this now it is
still<00:00:21.900> under<00:00:22.289> construction<00:00:22.560> so<00:00:23.340> that<00:00:23.490> means

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
still under construction so that means

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:25.220 
still under construction so that means
some<00:00:24.000> of<00:00:24.090> the<00:00:24.150> audio<00:00:24.300> needs<00:00:24.689> to<00:00:24.900> be<00:00:24.990> changed

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
some of the audio needs to be changed

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:26.750 
some of the audio needs to be changed
around<00:00:25.470> some<00:00:25.980> of<00:00:26.070> the<00:00:26.130> video<00:00:26.400> will<00:00:26.640> be

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
around some of the video will be

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.880 
around some of the video will be
slightly<00:00:27.060> changed<00:00:27.720> and<00:00:27.900> stuff<00:00:28.080> like<00:00:28.289> that<00:00:28.349> now

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
slightly changed and stuff like that now

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.919 
slightly changed and stuff like that now
it<00:00:29.010> is<00:00:29.070> rather<00:00:29.369> short<00:00:29.519> but<00:00:30.119> this<00:00:30.420> is<00:00:30.660> probably

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
it is rather short but this is probably

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:32.749 
it is rather short but this is probably
and<00:00:31.529> I'm<00:00:31.710> still<00:00:31.980> sort<00:00:32.219> of<00:00:32.279> going<00:00:32.610> around

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
and I'm still sort of going around

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.030 
and I'm still sort of going around
trying<00:00:33.059> to<00:00:33.210> confirm<00:00:33.570> this<00:00:33.870> but<00:00:34.469> this<00:00:34.649> could

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
trying to confirm this but this could

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.110 
trying to confirm this but this could
probably<00:00:35.460> be<00:00:35.790> the<00:00:36.690> first<00:00:37.140> flash<00:00:37.739> series<00:00:38.370> to

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
probably be the first flash series to

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.860 
probably be the first flash series to
ever<00:00:39.300> become<00:00:39.510> in<00:00:39.989> a<00:00:40.379> anaglyph<00:00:41.100> 3d<00:00:41.280> format<00:00:42.210> so

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
ever become in a anaglyph 3d format so

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.440 
ever become in a anaglyph 3d format so
yeah<00:00:43.469> fingers<00:00:44.160> crossed<00:00:44.190> anyway<00:00:45.180> hope<00:00:45.420> you
