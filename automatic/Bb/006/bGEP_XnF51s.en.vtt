00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:08.900
 we are lucky to have 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:10.519
 a country that is very open 

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:13.240
 so 

00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:13.240
 hurdles 

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:21.670
 from africa to north america from 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:24.450
 south of europe from asia so i think 

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:28.210
 that it's very interesting for 

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:31.290
 to live here to have contact with with 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:34.120
 immigrants but also citizens 

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:36.910
 from luxembourg i think is a good model 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:37.780
 of oxbow immigration compared to 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:40.899
 many other countries 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:44.559
 he really has the integration he having the 

00:00:40.899 --> 00:00:46.640
 possibility to future gasoline takes place 

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:48.880
 how beautiful 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:50.710
 it's balÃ¨ze immigration 

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:54.100
 an unavoidable dimension for the 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:56.300
 luxembourg since 150 years luxembourg 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:58.760
 of today would not be 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:01.040
 would not work like he 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:02.630
 works 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:04.519
 if there were not these different 

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:06.530
 waves of immigration 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:10.969
 there is a significant level input 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:13.869
 cultural associative sports and especially 

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:13.869
 also economical 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:27.730
 to start 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:27.730
 and this match 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:39.580
 what is certain is that there was 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:41.530
 always big waves 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:45.670
 of immigration to luxembourg like the 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:48.040
 italian the portuguese and game 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:52.920
 I think luxembourg in a very 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:52.920
 small country can take advantage of this because 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:56.580
 much diversity comes 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:59.440
 in 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:00.760
 in everyday life 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:01.720
 what is once 

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:03.530
 or else 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:06.040
 I want 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:06.040
 yamani 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.420
