00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:10.400
 Hello everyone, I am RXSFAI. 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.600
 This time I want to tell you about PHANTOM BOW, Phantom Compound Bow. 

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:17.660
 In the previous Phantom Project 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:19.980
 There are quite a few puzzle masters on the Internet. 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:25.080
 Successfully solved some of the puzzle eggs in BF4 one by one. 

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:28.440
 After unlocking to stage 4 of the Phantom Project 

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:30.960
 Everyone can get this PHANTOM BOW 

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:34.760
 After starting the online method of how to get the PHANTOM BOW method 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:39.080
 There was a time when everyone used PHANTOM BOW 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.860
 But a lot of people are using them soon after they kill one or two enemies 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.360
 They will immediately turn back to the gun 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:51.480
 People who have used this PHANTOM BOW should also understand the difficulty of using it. 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:56.140
 PHANTOM BOW's metal aiming is very difficult for you to see where you are aiming 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:01.680
 Even if you can know from the online information, what is the distance between the three colors of red, yellow and green? 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.240
 But when you actually use PHANTOM BOW, you won’t think of it for a big chance. 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:10.640
 Because when you fight against other rifles, machine guns, etc. 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:16.960
 When you want to react and come, you have to calmly recall all kinds of corresponding color aiming, and then fire again. 

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:20.480
 I believe that not many people will do it. 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:24.640
 And every time you shoot the arrow, it takes 2.4 seconds to replace it with a new one. 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.440
 This time is basically the same as other rifles for a magazine. 

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:33.820
 So you have to be the same mentality as every shot and the whole bullet. 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:38.440
 You can't miss it, but if you miss it, you basically have no chance. 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:45.220
 So now you can only see some players using it on some pistols that allow PHANTOM BOW. 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:50.640
 And I did not use it again after completing the small task of the fourth stage of the Phantom. 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:57.680
 But recently, when I chose the gun, I also unlocked about 9 of all the gun accessories. 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:00.900
 And I don't like to use the same gun for too long. 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:05.160
 So when I chose the gun, I couldn’t find my favorite. 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:08.540
 When I saw the PHANTOM BOW at the carbine 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:12.420
 I thought, I didn't seem to have used PHANTOM BOW seriously. 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:14.800
 So in the end I just took it out again. 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:20.060
 When I use it again, my battle can be a nightmare. 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:24.840
 Basically, after killing an enemy, it will be discovered and killed. 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:28.460
 At that time, seriously considered its shortcomings. 

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:33.440
 The biggest disadvantage of PHANTOM BOW is that it takes too long to change arrows. 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:37.220
 I am killed every time I change my arrow. 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:41.360
 Only one arrow can kill one, except they are standing together 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:44.600
 Otherwise, I still have to kill one by one and one by one. 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:47.940
 And to avoid changing arrows in front of the enemy 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:51.060
 Only the sneak attack with PHANTOM BOW's only successful tactic 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:54.060
 PHANTOM BOW is actually a silencer weapon 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:59.160
 When you shoot an arrow, you don’t expose yourself to a small map of the enemy. 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:04.840
 And you can only kill one by one, so PHANTOM BOW is only suitable for sneak attacks. 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:07.880
 But the premise also requires you to hit every arrow. 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:11.240
 When you use PHANTOM BOW, no matter which arrow you shoot 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:16.560
 When launching, there will be a very obvious white throwing line. 

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:21.540
 If you can't shoot the enemy, the enemy can easily find out that you are fighting back as soon as you see the line. 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:27.420
 So even if PHANTOM BOW doesn't make you appear on the enemy's small map, be careful. 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:31.040
 Don’t shoot the enemy as soon as you see it. 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:33.920
 When sneak attack, calm down, pre-positioned to launch 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:37.680
 You have to know that the speed of the arrow is very slow. 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:43.820
 And the drop distance is big, so you need to pre-pre-position each time you launch. 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:47.420
 Can the enemy stand, wait for yours? 

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:51.340
 In addition, the pistol is also very important to PHANTOM BOW. 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:56.300
 Because you want to use PHANTOM BOW correctly, every arrow is also unlikely to hit 

00:03:56.300 --> 00:04:00.280
 And even if you hit it, it doesn't necessarily kill the enemy. 

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:04.540
 So a pistol can help you with a gun or a life 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:06.440
 There is no specific type of pistol 

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:10.200
 But I personally recommend using a powerful pistol. 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:13.180
 For example, the pistol of the revolver series or the Deagle 44 

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:18.380
 Deagle 44 can be equipped with a silencer, with PHANTOM BOW can be a combination of sneak attacks 

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:23.060
 PHANTOM BOW is so hard to use, why should I choose it and introduce it to everyone? 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:26.900
 In fact, the highest damage distance of PHANTOM BOW is the longest. 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.800
 Let’s take the wide arrow I use now. 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:36.220
 Its maximum damage has to start at 50m, and the minimum damage is only 93. 

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:40.920
 In the BF4, most of the gun battles occurred in the 50m range. 

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:46.200
 So if you are not hitting your stomach and feet, or if you are using defensive skills 

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:49.720
 As long as you hit the body, the enemy will definitely die. 

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:53.000
 If you have a certain degree of confidence in your own distance 

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.940
 May also be a sniper 

00:04:55.060 --> 00:05:00.540
 So to a certain extent, PHANTOM BOW is the same type as Chongfeng 

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:04.400
 But PHANTOM BOW pays more attention to your hit rate every time. 

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:08.680
 So using PHANTOM BOW is a technology that can greatly improve your peaks. 

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:11.580
 Also train your sneak attack skills 

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:17.180
 When you learn the sneak attack, you should kill the enemy first, and the enemy will not immediately discover you. 

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:22.600
 And you will also make you more predictive than others by using PHANTOM BOW. 

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.300
 So although it is necessary to use PHANTOM BOW, it requires a lot of technology. 

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:29.580
 However, once you use PHANTOM BOW well, turn back to the gun 

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:34.280
 Your position, the timing of the shot, etc. will be well trained. 

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:36.260
 Then I said it this time. 

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:38.980
 Let me tell you about it here first. 

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:45.700
 Since I am going to have a minor operation next week, I should not be able to make a new video next week. 

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:48.300
 I’m sorry to say to you first. 

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:55.280
 If the situation is ok, I will broadcast live on twitch on Saturday or Sunday. 

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:59.040
 I will re-release the new video after the next two weeks. 

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:04.080
 If you have any weapons or equipment that are as difficult to use as PHANTOM BOW 

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:09.360
 Remember to leave a comment and let me see it. Let me try it out. Is it so difficult? 

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:13.900
 Thank you for watching, we will see you in the next video, byebye
