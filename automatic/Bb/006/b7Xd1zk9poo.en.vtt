00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
a four it makes a weird impression so

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:32.780 
a four it makes a weird impression so
just<00:00:30.269> d6<00:00:31.019> Bishop<00:00:31.529> d7<00:00:31.740> things<00:00:32.369> like<00:00:32.579> that

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
just d6 Bishop d7 things like that

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:38.000 
just d6 Bishop d7 things like that
shouldn't<00:00:33.390> be<00:00:33.540> bad<00:00:33.809> huh<00:00:35.840> yeah<00:00:36.840> if<00:00:36.989> I<00:00:37.110> take<00:00:37.469> it<00:00:37.739> I

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
shouldn't be bad huh yeah if I take it I

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.790 
shouldn't be bad huh yeah if I take it I
don't<00:00:38.280> know<00:00:38.399> that<00:00:38.760> accelerates<00:00:39.450> stuff<00:00:40.110> and<00:00:40.379> so

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
don't know that accelerates stuff and so

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.240 
don't know that accelerates stuff and so
let's<00:00:41.040> just<00:00:41.250> drop<00:00:41.430> back<00:00:41.700> and<00:00:42.090> try<00:00:42.989> to<00:00:43.250> make

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
let's just drop back and try to make

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.430 
let's just drop back and try to make
some<00:00:44.579> more<00:00:44.940> use<00:00:45.210> of<00:00:45.239> that<00:00:45.660> of<00:00:45.930> the<00:00:46.170> hook<00:00:46.260> of<00:00:46.410> the

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
some more use of that of the hook of the

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:57.139 
some more use of that of the hook of the
Queen<00:00:46.770> position<00:00:47.930> so<00:00:49.850> what<00:00:50.850> is<00:00:50.879> he<00:00:51.149> doing<00:00:52.820> 95<00:00:56.149> ok

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
Queen position so what is he doing 95 ok

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.660 
Queen position so what is he doing 95 ok
ok<00:00:57.449> then<00:00:57.660> I'll<00:00:57.989> oh-6<00:00:58.350> bishop<00:00:59.039> edge<00:00:59.160> for<00:00:59.550> us

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
ok then I'll oh-6 bishop edge for us

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:09.160 
ok then I'll oh-6 bishop edge for us
probably<00:01:00.210> not<00:01:00.329> a<00:01:00.390> real<00:01:01.250> solution<00:01:02.250> down

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:09.170 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:34.830 

you

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:34.840 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:41.469 

cam<00:01:35.840> threatening<00:01:36.400> 94-year<00:01:37.420> regardless<00:01:40.479> isn't

00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:41.479 
cam threatening 94-year regardless isn't

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:45.580 
cam threatening 94-year regardless isn't
isn't<00:01:41.720> that<00:01:42.020> good<00:01:42.260> 94<00:01:43.690> why<00:01:44.690> does<00:01:45.020> he<00:01:45.170> have<00:01:45.290> this

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:45.590 
isn't that good 94 why does he have this

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:49.270 
isn't that good 94 why does he have this
this<00:01:45.830> wacky<00:01:46.400> quincy<00:01:47.119> formal<00:01:47.979> which<00:01:48.979> looks

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:49.280 
this wacky quincy formal which looks

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:56.530 
this wacky quincy formal which looks
totally<00:01:50.650> totally<00:01:51.650> wrong<00:01:52.840> maybe<00:01:55.030> maybe<00:01:56.030> has

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:56.540 
totally totally wrong maybe maybe has

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:12.240 
totally totally wrong maybe maybe has
that<00:01:56.840> move<00:02:00.399> anyway

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.250

assembly<00:03:23.470> didn't<00:03:23.769> calculate<00:03:24.299> here<00:03:25.860> even<00:03:26.860> this

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:27.010 
assembly didn't calculate here even this

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:31.550 
assembly didn't calculate here even this
is<00:03:27.070> the<00:03:27.900> prolly<00:03:28.980> yeah<00:03:29.980> it's<00:03:30.280> not<00:03:30.459> great<00:03:30.760> but<00:03:30.790> I

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560 
is the prolly yeah it's not great but I

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:33.840 
is the prolly yeah it's not great but I
had<00:03:32.560> something<00:03:32.890> that<00:03:33.070> I<00:03:33.220> could<00:03:33.310> have<00:03:33.580> played

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:33.850 
had something that I could have played

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:38.310 
had something that I could have played
at<00:03:34.480> least<00:03:34.870> it's<00:03:35.350> a<00:03:35.530> pawn<00:03:36.810> but<00:03:37.810> not<00:03:38.019> enough

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:38.320 
at least it's a pawn but not enough

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:39.960 
at least it's a pawn but not enough
compensation<00:03:38.709> of<00:03:39.160> course<00:03:39.430> yeah<00:03:39.790> I<00:03:39.820> just

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:39.970 
compensation of course yeah I just

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:48.090 
compensation of course yeah I just
didn't<00:03:40.540> see<00:03:40.690> Queen<00:03:40.930> d7<00:03:41.380> oh<00:03:43.290> yeah<00:03:46.650> yeah<00:03:47.650> yeahs

just<00:03:50.700> terrible<00:03:52.230> maybe<00:03:53.230> the<00:03:54.040> engine<00:03:54.430> gives

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:54.670 
just terrible maybe the engine gives

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:57.539 
just terrible maybe the engine gives
that<00:03:54.940> also<00:03:55.450> as<00:03:55.650> clearly<00:03:56.650> bottom<00:03:57.070> the<00:03:57.280> Queen

00:03:57.539 --> 00:03:57.549
