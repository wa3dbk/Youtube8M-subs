have<00:01:15.920> an<00:01:16.070> older<00:01:16.490> washing<00:01:16.939> machine<00:01:17.210> so<00:01:17.420> I'm<00:01:17.570> not

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:17.780 
have an older washing machine so I'm not

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:20.440 
have an older washing machine so I'm not
sure<00:01:18.140> how<00:01:19.070> this<00:01:19.640> will<00:01:19.880> work<00:01:19.939> on<00:01:20.360> a

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:20.450 
sure how this will work on a

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:22.690 
sure how this will work on a
high-efficiency<00:01:20.960> washer<00:01:21.740> or<00:01:22.250> anything<00:01:22.490> like

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:22.700 
high-efficiency washer or anything like

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:24.280 
high-efficiency washer or anything like
that<00:01:22.760> so<00:01:22.940> you<00:01:23.120> might<00:01:23.720> want<00:01:23.900> to<00:01:23.960> double<00:01:24.110> check

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:24.290 
that so you might want to double check

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:27.730 
that so you might want to double check
but<00:01:25.250> what<00:01:25.610> I'm<00:01:25.760> going<00:01:26.060> to<00:01:26.150> do<00:01:26.480> is<00:01:26.750> turn<00:01:27.290> my

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:27.740 
but what I'm going to do is turn my

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:31.150 
but what I'm going to do is turn my
washing<00:01:28.430> machine<00:01:28.940> to<00:01:29.510> the<00:01:29.750> highest<00:01:30.080> load<00:01:30.710> size

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:31.160

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:34.150

and<00:01:31.640> the<00:01:32.390> hottest<00:01:32.690> setting<00:01:33.170> and<00:01:33.590> then<00:01:33.710> I<00:01:33.980> am

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:34.160 
and the hottest setting and then I am

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:36.460 
and the hottest setting and then I am
just<00:01:34.430> going<00:01:34.700> to<00:01:34.820> add<00:01:35.060> two<00:01:35.480> cups<00:01:35.510> of<00:01:36.020> vinegar

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:36.470 
just going to add two cups of vinegar

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:40.060 
just going to add two cups of vinegar
and<00:01:37.600> this<00:01:38.600> just<00:01:38.900> really<00:01:39.200> helps<00:01:39.350> with<00:01:39.890> any

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:40.070 
and this just really helps with any

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:41.680 
and this just really helps with any
build-up<00:01:40.610> that<00:01:40.640> might<00:01:41.030> be<00:01:41.210> in<00:01:41.330> your<00:01:41.360> washing

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:43.840 
build-up that might be in your washing
machine<00:01:41.930> and<00:01:42.530> your<00:01:42.830> washing<00:01:43.280> machine<00:01:43.610> will

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:43.850 
machine and your washing machine will

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:46.780 
machine and your washing machine will
run<00:01:44.630> more<00:01:44.900> efficiently<00:01:45.290> and<00:01:46.070> it<00:01:46.460> will<00:01:46.640> just

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:46.790 
run more efficiently and it will just

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:49.300 
run more efficiently and it will just
get<00:01:46.970> rid<00:01:47.030> of<00:01:47.240> any<00:01:47.450> junk<00:01:48.409> that<00:01:48.650> might<00:01:48.950> be<00:01:49.190> in
