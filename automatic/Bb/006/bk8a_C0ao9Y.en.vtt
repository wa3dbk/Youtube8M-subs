00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:55.510 
on the surface right cuz our goal was to
make<00:03:53.840> what<00:03:54.020> he's<00:03:54.110> so<00:03:54.260> likable<00:03:54.740> then<00:03:55.220> when<00:03:55.430> he

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:55.520 
make what he's so likable then when he

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:57.100 
make what he's so likable then when he
started<00:03:55.790> kind<00:03:56.090> of<00:03:56.120> becoming<00:03:56.450> a<00:03:56.600> jerk<00:03:56.900> he<00:03:57.080> was

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:57.110 
started kind of becoming a jerk he was

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:59.200 
started kind of becoming a jerk he was
like<00:03:57.500> Oh<00:03:57.710> woody<00:03:58.250> don't<00:03:58.490> make<00:03:58.700> those<00:03:58.910> choices

00:03:59.200 --> 00:03:59.210 
like Oh woody don't make those choices

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:01.990 
like Oh woody don't make those choices
instead<00:03:59.900> of<00:03:59.990> what<00:04:00.440> I<00:04:00.470> sure<00:04:01.100> you<00:04:01.610> don't<00:04:01.790> care

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:02.000

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:07.490 
this process to have things not work

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:10.030 
this process to have things not work
when<00:04:07.880> you<00:04:07.970> have<00:04:08.120> these<00:04:08.500> crashing<00:04:09.500> things<00:04:09.800> that

00:04:12.699 --> 00:04:12.709 
happen the rebuilding allow something to

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:15.040 
happen the rebuilding allow something to
be<00:04:12.800> so<00:04:13.010> much<00:04:13.160> better<00:04:13.400> after<00:04:14.120> this<00:04:14.570> experience

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:15.050 
be so much better after this experience
