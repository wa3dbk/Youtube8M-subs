holder and I wasn't the first year and I

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:37.880 
holder and I wasn't the first year and I
was<00:03:35.970> one<00:03:36.150> of<00:03:36.239> those<00:03:36.299> snobs<00:03:36.660> who<00:03:36.840> said<00:03:37.110> MLS<00:03:37.680> is<00:03:37.860> a

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:37.890 
was one of those snobs who said MLS is a

was one of those snobs who said MLS is a

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:39.750 
second-rate league and then I watched

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:41.840 
second-rate league and then I watched
and<00:03:40.200> I<00:03:40.320> realized<00:03:40.650> it's<00:03:40.890> a<00:03:40.950> lot<00:03:41.100> better<00:03:41.370> of<00:03:41.730> a

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:41.850 
and I realized it's a lot better of a

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:43.520 
and I realized it's a lot better of a
product<00:03:42.269> than<00:03:42.450> I<00:03:42.540> thought<00:03:42.840> and<00:03:43.079> I<00:03:43.140> thought<00:03:43.320> it

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:43.530 
product than I thought and I thought it

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:46.039 
product than I thought and I thought it
was<00:03:43.650> a<00:03:43.860> retirement<00:03:44.670> League<00:03:44.790> or<00:03:45.000> a<00:03:45.390> breeding

00:03:46.039 --> 00:03:46.049 
was a retirement League or a breeding

was a retirement League or a breeding
ground<00:03:46.170> for<00:03:46.470> better<00:03:46.739> leaks<00:03:47.010> and<00:03:47.400> I<00:03:47.459> think<00:03:47.610> it

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760 
ground for better leaks and I think it

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:49.880 
ground for better leaks and I think it
still<00:03:48.060> can<00:03:48.390> be<00:03:48.630> that<00:03:48.870> for<00:03:49.170> the<00:03:49.500> bigger<00:03:49.650> names

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:49.890 
still can be that for the bigger names

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:51.170 
still can be that for the bigger names
or<00:03:50.100> for<00:03:50.190> the<00:03:50.280> other<00:03:50.400> players<00:03:50.700> but<00:03:50.880> there<00:03:51.030> is<00:03:51.150> a

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:51.180 
or for the other players but there is a

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:52.460 
or for the other players but there is a
middle<00:03:51.420> ground<00:03:51.690> that<00:03:51.780> is<00:03:51.930> much<00:03:52.260> higher

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:52.470 
middle ground that is much higher

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:54.440 
middle ground that is much higher
quality<00:03:52.650> than<00:03:52.950> I<00:03:53.130> thought<00:03:53.340> having<00:03:54.180> not

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:54.450 
quality than I thought having not

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:56.870 
quality than I thought having not
watched<00:03:54.690> it<00:03:54.870> I<00:03:55.320> don't<00:03:56.010> know<00:03:56.190> I<00:03:56.370> think<00:03:56.760> that

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:56.880 
watched it I don't know I think that

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:59.090 
watched it I don't know I think that
that<00:03:57.030> you<00:03:57.060> should<00:03:57.510> convince<00:03:58.170> people<00:03:58.709> who<00:03:58.860> care

00:03:59.090 --> 00:03:59.100 
that you should convince people who care

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:00.500 
that you should convince people who care
about<00:03:59.130> the<00:03:59.519> English<00:03:59.730> Premier<00:04:00.030> League<00:04:00.060> or<00:04:00.329> care

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:00.510 
about the English Premier League or care

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:02.569 
about the English Premier League or care
about<00:04:00.540> Syria<00:04:01.470> or<00:04:01.829> whatever<00:04:02.310> their<00:04:02.459> favorite

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:02.579 
about Syria or whatever their favorite

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:05.660 
about Syria or whatever their favorite
league<00:04:02.850> is<00:04:03.000> to<00:04:03.239> watch<00:04:04.200> MLS<00:04:04.799> I<00:04:05.040> think<00:04:05.549> the

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:05.670 
league is to watch MLS I think the

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:07.160 
league is to watch MLS I think the

get<00:04:22.260> people<00:04:22.560> on<00:04:22.620> board<00:04:22.740> is<00:04:22.979> it<00:04:23.099> taking<00:04:23.370> them<00:04:23.490> to

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:23.610 
get people on board is it taking them to

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:25.490 
get people on board is it taking them to
a<00:04:23.640> live<00:04:23.880> game<00:04:24.150> because<00:04:24.450> I'll<00:04:24.840> be<00:04:25.080> honest<00:04:25.410> I

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:25.500 
a live game because I'll be honest I

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:27.290 
a live game because I'll be honest I
mean<00:04:25.620> obviously<00:04:26.490> I<00:04:26.580> played<00:04:26.820> an<00:04:26.910> emmalin

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:27.300 
mean obviously I played an emmalin

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:29.029 
mean obviously I played an emmalin
a long<00:04:27.449> time<00:04:27.720> but<00:04:27.990> Philadelphia<00:04:28.530> Union<00:04:28.710> is<00:04:28.919> in

00:04:29.029 --> 00:04:29.039 
a long time but Philadelphia Union is in

00:04:29.039 --> 00:04:30.770 
a long time but Philadelphia Union is in
my<00:04:29.129> top<00:04:29.370> team<00:04:29.610> to<00:04:29.759> go<00:04:29.849> watch<00:04:30.060> if<00:04:30.270> I<00:04:30.330> had<00:04:30.479> to<00:04:30.569> pick

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:30.780 
my top team to go watch if I had to pick

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:32.960 
my top team to go watch if I had to pick
no<00:04:31.650> it's<00:04:31.800> terrible<00:04:32.039> it's<00:04:32.430> terrible<00:04:32.490> to<00:04:32.879> watch

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:32.970 
no it's terrible it's terrible to watch

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:34.760 
no it's terrible it's terrible to watch
and<00:04:33.210> that's<00:04:33.330> the<00:04:33.449> problem<00:04:33.659> right<00:04:33.840> now<00:04:34.020> for<00:04:34.710> the

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:34.770 
and that's the problem right now for the

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:35.930 
and that's the problem right now for the
Union<00:04:34.979> not<00:04:35.069> only<00:04:35.129> are<00:04:35.400> they<00:04:35.460> not<00:04:35.580> playing<00:04:35.699> well

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:35.940 
Union not only are they not playing well

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:37.550 
Union not only are they not playing well
this<00:04:36.150> year<00:04:36.419> and<00:04:36.840> they're<00:04:36.960> not<00:04:37.110> fun<00:04:37.349> to<00:04:37.530> watch

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:37.560 
this year and they're not fun to watch

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:39.909 
this year and they're not fun to watch
and<00:04:38.400> I<00:04:38.460> think<00:04:38.729> that's<00:04:38.909> an<00:04:39.090> issue

00:04:39.909 --> 00:04:39.919 
and I think that's an issue

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:41.960 
and I think that's an issue
philosophically<00:04:40.919> that<00:04:40.949> MLS<00:04:41.490> teams<00:04:41.729> need<00:04:41.940> to

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:41.970 
philosophically that MLS teams need to

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:44.839 
philosophically that MLS teams need to
think<00:04:42.240> about<00:04:42.330> you're<00:04:42.960> a<00:04:42.990> new<00:04:43.319> team<00:04:44.250> in<00:04:44.610> a

00:04:44.839 --> 00:04:44.849 
think about you're a new team in a

00:04:44.849 --> 00:04:46.640 
think about you're a new team in a
market<00:04:45.240> that<00:04:45.419> doesn't<00:04:46.050> really<00:04:46.259> have<00:04:46.409> a<00:04:46.440> lot<00:04:46.620> of

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:46.650 
market that doesn't really have a lot of

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:48.680 
market that doesn't really have a lot of
soccer<00:04:46.889> history<00:04:47.129> and<00:04:47.610> you<00:04:48.090> want<00:04:48.270> to<00:04:48.360> win<00:04:48.449> every

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:48.690 
soccer history and you want to win every

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:50.450 
soccer history and you want to win every
game<00:04:48.720> one<00:04:49.050> nothing<00:04:49.229> and<00:04:49.740> when<00:04:49.860> you<00:04:49.949> lose<00:04:50.190> games

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:50.460 
game one nothing and when you lose games

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:52.999 
game one nothing and when you lose games
one<00:04:50.639> nothing<00:04:50.819> where<00:04:51.150> you<00:04:51.240> tie<00:04:51.449> 0-0<00:04:52.050> fans

00:04:52.999 --> 00:04:53.009 
one nothing where you tie 0-0 fans

00:04:53.009 --> 00:04:54.379 
one nothing where you tie 0-0 fans
aren't<00:04:53.220> gonna<00:04:53.460> come<00:04:53.819> back<00:04:54.030> and<00:04:54.300> I<00:04:54.360> think

00:04:54.379 --> 00:04:54.389 
aren't gonna come back and I think

00:04:54.389 --> 00:04:56.689 
aren't gonna come back and I think
that's<00:04:54.720> an<00:04:54.840> issue<00:04:54.930> if<00:04:55.680> the<00:04:56.069> Union<00:04:56.310> can<00:04:56.460> go<00:04:56.550> win

00:04:56.689 --> 00:04:56.699 
that's an issue if the Union can go win

00:04:56.699 --> 00:04:57.890 
that's an issue if the Union can go win
a<00:04:56.729> cup<00:04:57.000> yeah<00:04:57.270> I<00:04:57.300> think<00:04:57.389> it's<00:04:57.569> gonna<00:04:57.659> be<00:04:57.780> great

00:04:57.890 --> 00:04:57.900 
a cup yeah I think it's gonna be great

00:04:57.900 --> 00:04:58.909 
a cup yeah I think it's gonna be great
but<00:04:58.229> if<00:04:58.319> they're<00:04:58.470> doing<00:04:58.500> what<00:04:58.770> they're<00:04:58.889> doing

00:04:58.909 --> 00:04:58.919 
but if they're doing what they're doing

00:04:58.919 --> 00:05:01.279 
but if they're doing what they're doing
now<00:04:59.190> and<00:04:59.460> just<00:04:59.610> playing<00:04:59.969> ultimately<00:05:00.870> boring

00:05:01.279 --> 00:05:01.289 
now and just playing ultimately boring

00:05:01.289 --> 00:05:03.740 
now and just playing ultimately boring
soccer<00:05:01.530> it's<00:05:02.039> very<00:05:02.400> hard<00:05:02.759> to<00:05:03.240> convince<00:05:03.509> people

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:03.750 
soccer it's very hard to convince people

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:05.629 
soccer it's very hard to convince people
to<00:05:03.870> come<00:05:04.080> watch<00:05:04.289> my<00:05:04.889> daughter<00:05:05.129> comes<00:05:05.400> to<00:05:05.490> games

00:05:05.629 --> 00:05:05.639 
to come watch my daughter comes to games

00:05:05.639 --> 00:05:07.730 
to come watch my daughter comes to games
with<00:05:05.789> me<00:05:05.879> and<00:05:06.090> I<00:05:06.629> would<00:05:06.840> rather<00:05:07.020> it<00:05:07.289> be<00:05:07.319> for

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:07.740 
with me and I would rather it be for

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:09.709 
with me and I would rather it be for
four<00:05:08.039> because<00:05:08.699> that<00:05:08.849> means<00:05:08.940> she<00:05:09.240> gets<00:05:09.360> to<00:05:09.539> do

00:05:09.709 --> 00:05:09.719 
four because that means she gets to do

00:05:09.719 --> 00:05:11.450 
four because that means she gets to do
four<00:05:10.020> times<00:05:10.199> all<00:05:10.530> she<00:05:10.770> wants<00:05:11.039> to<00:05:11.099> do<00:05:11.190> is<00:05:11.310> jump

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:11.460 
four times all she wants to do is jump

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:12.559 
four times all she wants to do is jump
up<00:05:11.580> and<00:05:11.759> down<00:05:11.849> and<00:05:12.000> say<00:05:12.120> nuke<00:05:12.330> doop-doop

00:05:12.559 --> 00:05:12.569 
up and down and say nuke doop-doop

00:05:12.569 --> 00:05:14.899 
up and down and say nuke doop-doop
that's<00:05:13.169> all<00:05:13.319> she<00:05:13.500> wants<00:05:13.740> and<00:05:14.340> I<00:05:14.430> think<00:05:14.639> if<00:05:14.759> we

00:05:14.899 --> 00:05:14.909 
that's all she wants and I think if we

00:05:14.909 --> 00:05:16.550 
that's all she wants and I think if we
can<00:05:15.090> give<00:05:15.270> her<00:05:15.449> that<00:05:15.599> four<00:05:15.810> times<00:05:16.050> a<00:05:16.199> game<00:05:16.349> two

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:16.560 
can give her that four times a game two

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:18.619 
can give her that four times a game two
times<00:05:16.830> a<00:05:17.009> game<00:05:17.159> she'll<00:05:17.940> want<00:05:18.120> to<00:05:18.150> go<00:05:18.210> every

00:05:18.619 --> 00:05:18.629 
times a game she'll want to go every

00:05:18.629 --> 00:05:20.570 
times a game she'll want to go every
single<00:05:18.780> week<00:05:19.020> and<00:05:19.259> then<00:05:19.680> as<00:05:19.979> she<00:05:20.310> gets<00:05:20.400> older

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:20.580 
single week and then as she gets older

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:21.950 
single week and then as she gets older
she'll<00:05:20.969> understand<00:05:21.360> the<00:05:21.479> nuance<00:05:21.750> of<00:05:21.900> the

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:21.960 
she'll understand the nuance of the

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:23.209 
she'll understand the nuance of the
games<00:05:22.139> will<00:05:22.319> understand<00:05:22.650> the<00:05:22.710> defense<00:05:23.099> is

00:05:23.209 --> 00:05:23.219 
games will understand the defense is

00:05:23.219 --> 00:05:25.610 
games will understand the defense is
more<00:05:23.430> important<00:05:23.879> than<00:05:24.180> scoring<00:05:24.629> goals<00:05:24.780> I<00:05:25.050> want

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:25.620 
more important than scoring goals I want

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:27.770 
more important than scoring goals I want
the<00:05:25.770> team<00:05:25.979> to<00:05:26.159> win<00:05:26.310> and<00:05:26.729> I'm<00:05:27.300> entertained

either way because I try and understand
