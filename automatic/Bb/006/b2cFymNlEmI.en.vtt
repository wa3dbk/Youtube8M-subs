 the discovery hamilton at night being 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:45.500
 favorable to the idea 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:48.650

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:53.330
 time to proposal hurts learned must 

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:56.480
 further reduce the cost of credit 

00:00:53.330 --> 00:01:01.660
 has substance and I have in my version 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:01.660
 sing them restrictive phelps 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:07.690
 and the mall 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:17.080
 the test in the fourth team with five goals 

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:23.380
 it was usual wind tune 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:26.170
 after this amazing strategy game is 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:29.140

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:32.350
 prosper your civilization over the 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:35.380
 years with the classic mix of 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:38.200
 war board and the best of 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:41.560
 you will learn a lot about 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:43.180
 history and all the difficulties of 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:45.760
 liberate a nation 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:48.760
 when you start the game you will have to choose 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:51.850
 which civilization do you want to release? 

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:54.460
 each one has a positive 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:57.400
 taken into account before starting the 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:02:00.340
 departure will make all the difference in 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:03.490
 one that you will take to take your 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:05.280
 people to glory during the game you will have 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:07.660
 choose which searches 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:11.020
 will do first 

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:14.830
 each one is a prerequisite for the next 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:15.970
 that will become available its people should 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:18.010
 be happy 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:21.660
 and for this you will have to build 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:24.130
 buildings with this stay like theaters 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:26.350
 hospitals among others 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:29.340
 at the same time you need to expand 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:32.950
 your army for a possible war 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:35.560
 soon develops in turns or is 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:38.410
 as well as in a board game and 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:40.810
 you can only make one movement of 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:43.690
 each unit per turn 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:46.150
 in the same way the construction of buildings 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:48.790
 and technological research have a 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:50.320
 shift-specific 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:53.320
 completed 

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:56.470
 strategy is vital to 

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:58.930
 this game since if you focus on 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:01.930
 example in scientific research and 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:04.690
 cultural buildings if the army could 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:07.510
 become fragile through war and its 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:08.260
 nation is easily dominated by the 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:10.930
 enemy 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:13.690
 but if it focuses on technologies 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:16.690
 military buildings your people will 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:17.680
 be unhappy that produce less in 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:19.930
 City 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:22.810
 moreover his people may still die 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:25.500
 of hunger if there are no workers and 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:28.170
 buildings for these purposes 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:31.920
 in civilization you still work with 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:34.590
 soft type and the economy to maintain alliances 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:37.500
 may be economically advantageous and 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:39.840
 but can also be a 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:42.990
 danger of opening its borders to 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:45.420
 seemingly friendly nation that can 

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:49.050
 to be using this advantage to 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:51.690
 plan the attack on their territory until 

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:54.110
 even religion is vital in this game 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:56.820
 and can be used as a form of 

00:03:54.110 --> 00:04:00.300
 influence neighboring cities 

00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:02.820
 these are just the main between 

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:05.760
 various other details that should be 

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:07.260
 taken into account in order to 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:10.110
 the victory in this game 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:12.870
 the goal is as broad as the 

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:15.060
 victory does not have to be 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:17.340
 necessarily military 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:19.320
 You can win the game by being the 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:22.380
 first nation to send a man to the 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:25.430
 space, for example, can also 

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:28.560
 more culturally and 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:31.850
 technologically as well as diverse 

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:33.210
 objectives other than the objective 

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:36.360
 military 

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:39.450

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:41.870
 stop playing this fifth game of the series

 the changes that were made were subtle 

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:48.600
 but make all the difference by making 

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:52.020
 game experience even more pleasurable 

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:54.630
