00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:15.039

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:19.810

00:00:15.039 --> 00:00:23.620

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:30.880
 I tried bb si about delaying it 

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:32.890
 our very clearly armrests I threw off 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:38.170
 until the side so as not to interfere means 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:42.780
 here is our handbrake move aside we move aside 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:46.480

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:50.890

00:00:54.969 --> 00:01:02.850
 it means for this we take here 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:06.999
 picked up such a tube for 10 here and 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:08.679
 then they drag and get by 

00:01:06.999 --> 00:01:13.350
 at least from the phone is not convenient 

00:01:08.679 --> 00:01:18.479

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:29.619

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:35.289
 start spinning here how many do u 

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:38.799
 we managed to pull it up with one hand 

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:43.090
 especially in the mini quite comfortable here under 

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:45.539

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:45.539

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:52.499
