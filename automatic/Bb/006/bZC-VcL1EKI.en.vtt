as well for starters as you can tell

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:42.009 
as well for starters as you can tell
unlike<00:03:39.769> the<00:03:39.950> original<00:03:40.120> tight<00:03:41.120> of<00:03:41.299> iron<00:03:41.630> box

00:03:42.009 --> 00:03:42.019 
unlike the original tight of iron box

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:45.280 
unlike the original tight of iron box
which<00:03:42.319> was<00:03:42.500> long<00:03:43.120> this<00:03:44.120> tied<00:03:44.420> up<00:03:44.569> iron<00:03:44.690> box<00:03:44.989> is

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:45.290 
which was long this tied up iron box is

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:46.930 
which was long this tied up iron box is
much<00:03:45.530> smaller<00:03:45.890> it's<00:03:46.069> about<00:03:46.160> the<00:03:46.280> size<00:03:46.519> of<00:03:46.760> most

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:46.940 
much smaller it's about the size of most

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:48.970 
much smaller it's about the size of most
of<00:03:47.150> the<00:03:47.209> expansion<00:03:47.660> boxes<00:03:48.290> so<00:03:48.650> that's<00:03:48.829> really

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:48.980 
of the expansion boxes so that's really

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:50.710 
of the expansion boxes so that's really
cool<00:03:49.160> makes<00:03:49.370> it<00:03:49.459> easier<00:03:49.760> to<00:03:49.819> store<00:03:50.150> what's

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:50.720 
cool makes it easier to store what's

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:53.170 
cool makes it easier to store what's
cool<00:03:50.989> is<00:03:51.200> they<00:03:51.560> didn't<00:03:51.950> they<00:03:52.190> didn't<00:03:52.459> scrimp

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:53.180 
cool is they didn't they didn't scrimp

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:56.890 
cool is they didn't they didn't scrimp
on<00:03:53.860> the<00:03:54.860> quality<00:03:55.340> the<00:03:55.790> pieces<00:03:56.269> everything<00:03:56.750> is

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:56.900 
on the quality the pieces everything is

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:58.960 
on the quality the pieces everything is
is<00:03:57.170> just<00:03:57.560> as<00:03:57.799> great<00:03:57.950> I<00:03:58.250> did<00:03:58.579> have<00:03:58.700> a<00:03:58.760> problem

00:03:58.960 --> 00:03:58.970 
is just as great I did have a problem

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:00.400 
is just as great I did have a problem
