00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:21.050
 tutorial and today I'm here with a new one 

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:23.540
 video to show you how to make a 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:25.880
 merging of two vehicles per hour 

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:27.680
 we put the vehicle in our garage 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:29.869
 that we want to give up 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:30.770
 let's go down and get out of ours 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:32.810
 garage 

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:35.600
 we open the phone and we do 

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:37.579
 quick rescue save ours 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:39.710
 game 

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:43.610
 expect the linen circle at the bottom a 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:46.040
 white right that loads once 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:47.120
 that the white linen circle disappears into 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:50.540
 lower right 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:52.870
 we have to leave the game we go out 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:52.870
 from the game 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:00.350
 once you exit the game you will need to have 

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:02.660
 a stick to attach to playstation 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:05.840
 3 inside the stick you will need to have two 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:08.420
 folders a renamed ps3 uppercase e 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:11.360
 inside the uppercase ps3 folder one 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:13.610
 renamed it is always capitalized and 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:14.810
 after we save our rescue 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:20.390
 on the flash drive 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:23.359

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:30.950

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:33.050

 I remind you that in the key for whom 

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:11.630
 open you will need to create a folder in 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:14.540
 uppercase ps3 inside the ps3 folder a 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:18.890

 Description link also shrunk 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:09.830
 this let's look for replace now 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:10.930
 we look for the vehicle we have 

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:12.870
 saved in the garage 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:16.799
 then 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:19.920
 primary in this case life is here 

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:22.560
 here and we must highlight the number 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:25.110
 so after the ics don't calculate these 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:28.080
 two numbers but we calculate those after the 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:33.510
 xc we stop where there is the comma we do 

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:37.170
 copy and paste on the first on the 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:42.000

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:44.700
 on we choose a vehicle to do the 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:47.849
 in this case fusion lazio around 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:51.750

00:03:55.230 --> 00:04:02.970
 of data hexadecimal values we do 

00:04:00.019 --> 00:04:05.579
 replace all this is important 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:08.400

00:04:05.579 --> 00:04:10.680
 let's do here where the floppy is saved 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:14.209
 here we can close the program 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:21.419
