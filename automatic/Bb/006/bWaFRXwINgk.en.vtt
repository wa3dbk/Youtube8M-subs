version<00:02:48.290> really<00:02:48.560> early<00:02:48.980> on<00:02:49.010> and<00:02:49.340> then<00:02:49.430> it<00:02:49.579> took

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:49.730 
version really early on and then it took

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:51.759 
version really early on and then it took
me<00:02:49.790> forever<00:02:50.150> to<00:02:50.660> get<00:02:50.930> the<00:02:51.079> corrosive<00:02:51.530> so<00:02:51.620> I<00:02:51.680> was

00:02:51.759 --> 00:02:51.769 
me forever to get the corrosive so I was

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:53.619 
me forever to get the corrosive so I was
like<00:02:51.859> man<00:02:52.069> I'm<00:02:52.280> done<00:02:52.849> I'm<00:02:53.120> just<00:02:53.150> going<00:02:53.390> to<00:02:53.420> tell

00:02:53.619 --> 00:02:53.629 
like man I'm done I'm just going to tell

00:02:53.629 --> 00:02:55.089 
like man I'm done I'm just going to tell
him<00:02:53.720> to<00:02:53.780> get<00:02:53.870> the<00:02:54.049> shock<00:02:54.290> so<00:02:54.530> here<00:02:54.680> it<00:02:54.769> is<00:02:54.859> I'm

00:02:55.089 --> 00:02:55.099 
him to get the shock so here it is I'm

00:02:55.099 --> 00:02:57.190 
him to get the shock so here it is I'm
showing<00:02:55.250> you<00:02:55.400> some<00:02:55.579> gameplay<00:02:55.819> now<00:02:56.150> I<00:02:56.390> got<00:02:57.019> the

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:57.200 
showing you some gameplay now I got the

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:58.750 
showing you some gameplay now I got the
Sham<00:02:57.410> shield<00:02:57.709> on<00:02:57.859> right<00:02:58.040> here<00:02:58.250> but<00:02:58.459> we<00:02:58.579> will

00:02:58.750 --> 00:02:58.760 
Sham shield on right here but we will

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:00.220 
Sham shield on right here but we will
put<00:02:58.940> the<00:02:59.060> B<00:02:59.209> on<00:02:59.390> here<00:02:59.599> in<00:02:59.659> a<00:02:59.720> little<00:02:59.959> bit<00:03:00.079> this

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:00.230 
put the B on here in a little bit this

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:02.289 
put the B on here in a little bit this
gun<00:03:00.470> is<00:03:00.680> a<00:03:00.709> beast<00:03:01.040> it<00:03:01.250> I<00:03:01.310> got<00:03:01.459> to<00:03:01.549> say<00:03:01.730> and<00:03:02.000> it

00:03:02.289 --> 00:03:02.299 
gun is a beast it I got to say and it

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:04.750 
gun is a beast it I got to say and it
looks<00:03:02.510> super<00:03:02.690> super<00:03:03.319> sexy<00:03:03.620> but<00:03:03.859> I<00:03:04.250> still<00:03:04.519> think

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:04.760 
looks super super sexy but I still think

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:07.390 
looks super super sexy but I still think
the<00:03:05.569> Cobra<00:03:05.900> is<00:03:06.019> better<00:03:06.230> if<00:03:06.560> you<00:03:06.590> ask<00:03:06.920> me<00:03:07.129> but<00:03:07.340> I

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:07.400 
the Cobra is better if you ask me but I

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:08.860 
the Cobra is better if you ask me but I
haven't<00:03:07.700> used<00:03:07.940> the<00:03:08.120> shock<00:03:08.359> I<00:03:08.540> don't<00:03:08.720> really

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:08.870 
haven't used the shock I don't really

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:11.199 
haven't used the shock I don't really
know<00:03:09.049> what<00:03:09.260> the<00:03:09.409> shock<00:03:09.680> you<00:03:10.370> know<00:03:10.670> what<00:03:11.030> the

00:03:11.199 --> 00:03:11.209 
know what the shock you know what the

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:12.880 
know what the shock you know what the
difference<00:03:11.569> is<00:03:11.750> so<00:03:12.409> I'm<00:03:12.500> going<00:03:12.590> to<00:03:12.650> read<00:03:12.769> from

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:12.890 
difference is so I'm going to read from

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:14.619 
difference is so I'm going to read from

00:03:14.619 --> 00:03:14.629 
the wiki right now I will say that it is

00:03:14.629 --> 00:03:16.899
