right one to the left one and you can

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:41.000 
right one to the left one and you can
seal<00:00:36.270> that<00:00:36.800> what<00:00:39.200> this<00:00:40.200> here<00:00:40.500> is<00:00:40.620> supposed<00:00:40.920> to

seal that what this here is supposed to

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:46.279 
seal that what this here is supposed to
be<00:00:41.160> black<00:00:41.399> see<00:00:41.940> that<00:00:42.860> powdery<00:00:43.860> stuff<00:00:45.289> it's

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:49.580 
be black see that powdery stuff it's
basically<00:00:46.469> just<00:00:48.230> disintegrating<00:00:49.230> from<00:00:49.440> me

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
basically just disintegrating from me

00:00:56.149 --> 00:00:58.520 
a fairly rushing client player so
eventually<00:00:57.149> that's<00:00:57.539> going<00:00:57.719> to<00:00:57.809> get<00:00:57.960> worse<00:00:58.260> and

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
eventually that's going to get worse and

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.209

cause that problem when you push it in
hold<00:01:15.000> it<00:01:15.119> forward<00:01:15.740> you<00:01:16.740> can<00:01:16.890> see<00:01:17.100> where<00:01:17.310> it's

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
hold it forward you can see where it's

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:23.680 
hold it forward you can see where it's
coming<00:01:18.409> it's<00:01:19.409> coming<00:01:19.560> off<00:01:19.950> the
