00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:08.020
 bike control through 

00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:08.020
 not that will be the first thing 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:22.189
 and also does not mean the appearance 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:24.079
 of course, in reverse, that me 

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:28.570
 now in the dark with a garni 

00:00:24.079 --> 00:00:32.390
 not allowed to drive your bike 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:34.219
 a passport they wanted to give us 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:35.420
 have several places here today 

00:00:34.219 --> 00:00:37.520
 city ​​area in celle the cyclists 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:38.809
 controlled mainly on the account 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:40.910
 to school 

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:43.040
 it seems that the controls the 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:44.570
 We have been in the past few days 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:46.460
 have led to this 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:49.370
 that many now more to the 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:50.750
 given rules and that 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:52.790
 is also the purpose of this action 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:54.710
 we just want to point that out 

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:55.970
 the cyclists come back 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:58.070
 Regulations hold correct bike paths 

00:00:55.970 --> 00:01:00.410
 use the lights to turn on and on 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:02.270
 so better for other road users 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:05.050
 are visible and no danger 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:05.050
 moments arise 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.950
 performance is not important to yourself 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:13.690
 see but to be seen 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:15.670
 In most cases, wear now 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:17.619
 This year, the road users 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:19.300
 cyclist dark clothes dark 

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:21.220
 bicycles maybe not even 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:22.450
 reflectors on the bikes and such 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:24.729
 they are quickly overlooked and it 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:26.740
 comes to dangerous situations for 

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:28.630
 the cyclists but also for one 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:38.860
 car driver the example of 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:40.570
 Turn a bike over there 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:42.910
 certain drivers for such a plug 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:45.039
 it is going to be lighting though 

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:46.750
 also used on other bikes and 

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:48.280
 as long as these lighting fixtures 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:50.830
 not to the detriment of others 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:52.930
 we will guide you 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:54.369
 Big digital belong away when they see you 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:57.420
 attached to a bicycle is the 

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:57.420
 actually not listened to 

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:05.560
 the consequence for someone here 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:08.400
 without light on the bike is traveling 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:10.720
 a Verwarngeld first of all but will 

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:12.400
 The people first talked into a certain 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:13.720
 We do not just have most of them 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:15.910
 not turned on of course would be with 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:17.080
 the broken bike is on the way 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:18.490
 will also be due bike 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:21.820
 show and then it is checked whether 

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:23.710
 the bike is okay again 

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:27.270
 all facilities comply with the regulations 

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:27.270
 Correspond and no lighting 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:37.250
 drove without light
