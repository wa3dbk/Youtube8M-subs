00:00:03.759 --> 00:00:11.510
 on your trip until the last moment you do not 

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:13.520
 I had nothing prepared in the car and 

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:16.400
 they came to the party of cheerful porto 

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:19.720
 getting closer and she led and 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:19.720
 they were left when I liked 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:29.510
 that is to say the last game with holland 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:32.680
 several of several friends that enter 

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:32.680
 known ended the match 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:38.399
 living my holder within the field of 

00:00:35.129 --> 00:00:41.500
 self and it says so some still 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:44.260
 they are traveling or they are in the river 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:45.399
 I am a passionate figure 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.399
 and the truth is that we are 

00:00:45.399 --> 00:00:49.260
 studying 

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:51.570
 and you and you wonder nutrient ago 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.699
 40 days you can not imagine playing the final 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.260
 of the world and title the truth that I 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:57.659
 I was beginning to feel the outside 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:01.109
 not me for all the bridges cycles 

00:00:57.659 --> 00:01:03.120
 prior to the lists then yes yes yes 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:05.610
 always as I said to me it was 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.899
 surprising but very desired because all 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:12.619
 eating lessons regarding the 

00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:12.619
 sports because he always did well in 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:17.530
 the pressure 

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:20.290
 to be between him 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:22.560
 between the 23 and so they went after no 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:25.300
 being fine so one 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.790
 one for me the most competitive guide 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:29.680
 and more for a defender was the best 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:33.060
 exam to prove that it was okay 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:37.110
 prepared physically and football 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:39.450
 and now watching people listen to the 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:43.050
 madness even if you see them pass the 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:45.180
 collective I do not know why 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:47.550
 we are not pending 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:50.880
 we are also unable to 

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:53.520
 see how you breathe day by day in 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.910
 Argentina all this euphoria that is 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.910
 gender 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:00.810
 in the journeys that we go the 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:02.549
 concentration to the stadium 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:05.140
 we see the people who wait for 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:07.240
 say hello 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:10.750
 why approach because a photo a 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:12.430
 I greet a scream and it did not come 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:15.660
 very much because there is time 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:19.480
 locked in here not being able to allow us to see 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:21.250
 that despair that was of the people 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:23.210
 in the stadium we enjoyed it very much and 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:25.670
 I think it's reflected in the field 

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:28.990
 and now on Sunday you can beat 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:32.930
 this from germany who are like magicians 

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:36.260
 like everything at the end against a very big 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:37.850
 team that he deserved did not have to be in the 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:42.530
 final and that deserved has to 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:45.310
 let's be afraid because our fire 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:45.310
 millions of times 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:50.200
 infinite things there is no good more than 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:52.239
 we have big 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:53.980
 very high quality players we have 

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:55.520
 the best in the world we have poor super 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:57.080
 the immigrant 

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:59.120
 that is not a good team, not because of something 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:00.400
 we need in the end and present 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:02.349
 before these practices 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:04.120
 the nails to the well the party the 

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:07.470
 plays and is playing towards is done 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:12.350
 difficult to nap why 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:12.350
 when closed you try to play 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:18.090
 so there are millionaire plays in 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:18.090
 the head and many you know him 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:25.220
 so you have to try to think what 

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:27.470
 less possible in what is going to be because 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:30.230
 or analyze with the governor points 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:33.250
 together with the staff, when the time has come 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:35.560
 that surely leave it to me tomorrow 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:37.990
 a summary of what Germany is already 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:40.630
 from that continue to be quiet 

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:42.900
 until the time of the game later when 

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:45.540
 start to see how it is going 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:48.329
 planning 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:50.010
 the party is giving the game of what 

00:03:48.329 --> 00:03:51.599
 way is going to stop germany of what 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:55.140
 way we're going to go out and look for 

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:57.030
 press wait and see being smart 

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:59.219
 and create the fastest easy in the field 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:00.859
 this match with brazil was exceptional 

00:03:59.219 --> 00:04:05.549
 in the image 

00:04:00.859 --> 00:04:08.129
 no doubt that it was a match that is 

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:11.440
 difficult to take measures of that party 

00:04:08.129 --> 00:04:13.360
 because the first corner goal 

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:16.500
 and from there I think Brazil 

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:16.500
 made things very easy 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:22.699
 emotional equilibrium period in all 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:24.979
 the lines and I congratulate and facilitate 

00:04:22.699 --> 00:04:26.330
 very much things germany 

00:04:24.979 --> 00:04:29.060
 12 

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:31.440
 to my way of seeing there are not seven goals 

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:34.249
 above 

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:39.219
 of Brazil nor is it 

00:04:34.249 --> 00:04:39.219
 germany in 0-0 that tied with 

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:46.470
 clear Algeria exactly then there are 

00:04:43.509 --> 00:04:46.470
 than to take certain parameters 

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:50.770
 with a lot 

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:58.510
 or you imagine Monday on Tuesday not what 

00:04:54.849 --> 00:05:01.180
 I want if I do not I do not want to imagine 

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:03.009
 we dream everything with the best of the finals 

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:04.790
 because I have done now 

00:05:03.009 --> 00:05:07.340
 every time and they go 

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:09.890
 and we are moving forward that should be more 

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:13.240
 ambitious than ever and now now 

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:18.380
 very much more are we a match 

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:22.600
 120 minutes and the team is strong from 

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:25.270
 the head with a lot of desire 

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:27.010
 then let's leave everything inside the 

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:28.240
 field so that after we can live what 

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:32.310
 what 

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:32.310
 what nothing stays that well
