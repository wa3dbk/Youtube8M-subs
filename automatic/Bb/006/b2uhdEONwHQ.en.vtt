episode<00:00:14.940> 37<00:00:15.809> was<00:00:16.199> a<00:00:16.230> good<00:00:16.650> episode<00:00:16.770> for<00:00:17.550> me

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
episode 37 was a good episode for me

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.189 
episode 37 was a good episode for me
personally<00:00:17.880> it's<00:00:18.240> obvious<00:00:18.570> the<00:00:18.720> second<00:00:19.020> half

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
personally it's obvious the second half

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:20.560 
personally it's obvious the second half
is<00:00:19.320> where<00:00:19.470> the<00:00:19.590> substance<00:00:20.010> lied<00:00:20.250> and

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:20.570 
is where the substance lied and

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:22.700 
is where the substance lied and
obviously<00:00:21.570> first<00:00:21.810> half<00:00:21.990> wasn't<00:00:22.320> really<00:00:22.560> that

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
obviously first half wasn't really that

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.109 
obviously first half wasn't really that
great<00:00:22.890> to<00:00:23.100> me<00:00:23.189> I<00:00:23.220> was<00:00:23.789> under<00:00:23.970> the<00:00:24.029> impression

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
great to me I was under the impression

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:25.730 
great to me I was under the impression
that<00:00:24.480> the<00:00:24.660> first<00:00:24.869> half<00:00:25.109> of<00:00:25.199> the<00:00:25.320> episode<00:00:25.650> was

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
that the first half of the episode was

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:26.929 
that the first half of the episode was
gonna<00:00:25.920> be<00:00:26.099> all<00:00:26.189> fanservice

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
gonna be all fanservice

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.599 
gonna be all fanservice
and<00:00:27.090> all<00:00:27.750> like<00:00:28.560> filler<00:00:28.859> material<00:00:29.369> and<00:00:29.490> stuff

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
and all like filler material and stuff

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.600 
and all like filler material and stuff
like<00:00:29.760> that<00:00:29.939> but<00:00:30.119> it<00:00:30.210> wasn't<00:00:30.570> so<00:00:30.779> clearly

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:31.610 
like that but it wasn't so clearly

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:33.620 
like that but it wasn't so clearly
obviously<00:00:32.610> that's<00:00:32.940> why<00:00:33.149> I'm<00:00:33.270> doing<00:00:33.420> the

she knows their strengths and weaknesses

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.280

and<00:02:41.190> how<00:02:41.340> to<00:02:41.400> work<00:02:41.610> that<00:02:41.790> but<00:02:42.000> now<00:02:42.150> her<00:02:42.390> dad<00:02:42.720> the

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
and how to work that but now her dad the

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:45.530 
and how to work that but now her dad the
person<00:02:43.650> that<00:02:43.770> she<00:02:44.010> learned<00:02:44.250> from<00:02:44.459> is<00:02:44.760> training

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
person that she learned from is training

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.510

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:47.520 
them for the next month and I think

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:49.610 
them for the next month and I think
that's<00:02:47.700> really<00:02:47.910> cool<00:02:48.209> because<00:02:48.420> you<00:02:48.840> know<00:02:48.930> Rico

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.770 
that's really cool because you know Rico
is<00:02:49.860> like<00:02:50.070> her<00:02:50.250> like<00:02:50.640> a<00:02:50.790> lesser<00:02:51.209> version<00:02:51.390> of<00:02:51.660> her

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 
is like her like a lesser version of her

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:53.240 
is like her like a lesser version of her
dad<00:02:51.989> when<00:02:52.170> it<00:02:52.260> comes<00:02:52.440> to<00:02:52.620> regimen<00:02:53.010> when<00:02:53.160> it

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
dad when it comes to regimen when it

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:54.590 
dad when it comes to regimen when it
comes<00:02:53.400> to<00:02:53.550> learning<00:02:53.700> while<00:02:53.970> skill<00:02:54.270> and<00:02:54.420> stuff

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:54.600 
comes to learning while skill and stuff

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.810 
comes to learning while skill and stuff
she<00:02:55.080> learned<00:02:55.290> that<00:02:55.410> ability<00:02:56.040> to<00:02:56.459> pretty<00:02:56.700> much

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:56.820 
she learned that ability to pretty much

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:59.270 
she learned that ability to pretty much
scan<00:02:57.330> a<00:02:57.630> person's<00:02:58.260> physique<00:02:58.770> and<00:02:59.010> their

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
scan a person's physique and their

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.040 
scan a person's physique and their
fitness<00:02:59.520> and<00:02:59.850> see<00:03:00.030> where<00:03:00.209> they<00:03:00.360> stack<00:03:00.660> up<00:03:00.690> and

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:01.050 
fitness and see where they stack up and

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:02.420 
fitness and see where they stack up and
I<00:03:01.380> think<00:03:01.560> it's<00:03:01.680> pretty<00:03:01.770> cool<00:03:01.950> that<00:03:02.010> her<00:03:02.160> dad's

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
I think it's pretty cool that her dad's

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:04.160 
I think it's pretty cool that her dad's
taking<00:03:02.850> over<00:03:03.030> now<00:03:03.150> because<00:03:03.300> he's<00:03:03.780> gonna<00:03:04.080> be

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170 
taking over now because he's gonna be

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:05.570 
taking over now because he's gonna be
better<00:03:04.560> he's<00:03:04.770> gonna<00:03:04.890> be<00:03:05.040> able<00:03:05.100> to<00:03:05.250> better

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:05.580 
better he's gonna be able to better

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:08.030 
better he's gonna be able to better

to<00:03:08.190> increase<00:03:08.340> their<00:03:08.670> strengths<00:03:09.090> and<00:03:09.239> how<00:03:09.570> to

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:09.600 
to increase their strengths and how to

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:11.330 
to increase their strengths and how to
make<00:03:09.810> the<00:03:09.959> weaknesses<00:03:10.440> less<00:03:10.650> exploitable

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
make the weaknesses less exploitable

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:13.070 
make the weaknesses less exploitable
because<00:03:12.209> you<00:03:12.330> know<00:03:12.420> like<00:03:12.630> the<00:03:12.750> last<00:03:12.870> few

episodes they were getting pretty

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:16.160 
episodes they were getting pretty
exploited<00:03:14.760> and<00:03:14.940> the<00:03:15.209> fact<00:03:15.450> that<00:03:15.600> they<00:03:16.110> were

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.170 
exploited and the fact that they were

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:18.470 
exploited and the fact that they were

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:29.540 
threat instead of you know having

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:31.789 
threat instead of you know having
exploitations<00:03:30.540> that<00:03:30.959> make<00:03:31.140> them<00:03:31.350> really<00:03:31.650> weak

00:03:31.789 --> 00:03:31.799 
exploitations that make them really weak

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:16.290 
that Kagame has been ma this whole

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:18.050 
that Kagame has been ma this whole
episode<00:04:16.410> from<00:04:16.769> the<00:04:16.919> second<00:04:17.160> half<00:04:17.370> ever<00:04:17.820> since

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:18.060 
episode from the second half ever since

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:21.979 
episode from the second half ever since
the<00:04:18.680> ever<00:04:19.680> since<00:04:20.010> the<00:04:20.790> hot<00:04:21.269> springs<00:04:21.599> he's<00:04:21.840> been

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:21.989 
the ever since the hot springs he's been

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:23.960 
the ever since the hot springs he's been
m.i.a<00:04:22.320> and<00:04:22.710> at<00:04:23.010> the<00:04:23.070> very<00:04:23.190> end<00:04:23.310> up<00:04:23.520> so<00:04:23.669> we<00:04:23.820> see

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:23.970 
m.i.a and at the very end up so we see

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:26.600 
m.i.a and at the very end up so we see
that<00:04:24.120> he's<00:04:24.240> returning<00:04:24.750> to<00:04:24.900> America<00:04:25.020> now<00:04:26.010> my

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:26.610 
that he's returning to America now my

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:27.529 
that he's returning to America now my
theory<00:04:26.849> on

00:04:27.529 --> 00:04:27.539 
theory on

00:04:27.539 --> 00:04:30.140 
theory on
and<00:04:27.689> it's<00:04:27.990> probably<00:04:28.289> very<00:04:28.699> likely<00:04:29.699> that<00:04:29.939> this

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:30.150 
and it's probably very likely that this

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:31.820 
and it's probably very likely that this
is<00:04:30.210> the<00:04:30.449> case<00:04:30.629> is<00:04:30.900> I<00:04:30.960> think<00:04:31.379> he's<00:04:31.499> going<00:04:31.680> to

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:31.830 
is the case is I think he's going to

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:33.950 
is the case is I think he's going to
America<00:04:32.280> to<00:04:32.310> train<00:04:32.729> since<00:04:33.539> he's<00:04:33.749> been<00:04:33.900> in

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:33.960 
America to train since he's been in

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:35.749 
America to train since he's been in

toe and I think that's really cool
because<00:05:21.839> now<00:05:22.229> you<00:05:22.770> know<00:05:22.800> Kagame<00:05:23.400> is<00:05:23.580> the<00:05:23.759> one

that needs to you know start getting
some<00:05:25.979> new<00:05:26.069> techniques<00:05:26.490> cuz<00:05:26.699> kudo<00:05:26.939> was<00:05:27.300> already
