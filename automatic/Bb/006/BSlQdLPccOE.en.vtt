woodworking joint the tongue-and-groove

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:23.649 
woodworking joint the tongue-and-groove
joint<00:00:20.210> with<00:00:21.140> a<00:00:21.409> simple<00:00:22.009> hand<00:00:22.429> plane<00:00:22.970> like<00:00:23.300> this

00:00:23.649 --> 00:00:23.659 
joint with a simple hand plane like this

00:00:23.659 --> 00:00:26.019 
joint with a simple hand plane like this
so<00:00:24.650> the<00:00:24.739> tongue<00:00:24.949> and<00:00:25.070> groove<00:00:25.130> joint<00:00:25.489> is<00:00:25.759> used

00:00:26.019 --> 00:00:26.029 
so the tongue and groove joint is used

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:28.149 
so the tongue and groove joint is used
for<00:00:26.269> many<00:00:26.390> things<00:00:26.480> including<00:00:27.159> putting

things so let's check out how to make it

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:38.340 
things so let's check out how to make it
I<00:00:34.910> really<00:00:35.780> like<00:00:35.960> the<00:00:36.590> old<00:00:36.949> stanley<00:00:37.399> number<00:00:37.519> 48

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:44.660 
think I got this for 20 or 25 with rust

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:47.080 
think I got this for 20 or 25 with rust
and<00:00:44.960> I<00:00:45.050> fixed<00:00:46.010> it<00:00:46.100> up<00:00:46.219> and<00:00:46.429> sharpen<00:00:46.789> the<00:00:46.850> blades

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:47.090 
and I fixed it up and sharpen the blades

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:49.840 
and I fixed it up and sharpen the blades
now<00:00:47.269> it<00:00:47.329> works<00:00:47.480> really<00:00:47.660> well<00:00:48.280> now<00:00:49.280> that<00:00:49.460> the

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:49.850 
now it works really well now that the

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:51.939 
now it works really well now that the
tongue<00:00:50.089> is<00:00:50.239> easy<00:00:50.449> part<00:00:50.780> to<00:00:50.899> cut<00:00:51.109> you<00:00:51.649> can<00:00:51.829> see

00:00:51.939 --> 00:00:51.949 
tongue is easy part to cut you can see

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:55.000 
tongue is easy part to cut you can see
on<00:00:52.039> this<00:00:52.219> old<00:00:52.910> Stanley's<00:00:53.359> 48<00:00:53.929> you<00:00:54.679> can<00:00:54.829> just

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:55.010 
on this old Stanley's 48 you can just

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:58.209 
on this old Stanley's 48 you can just
flip<00:00:55.309> it<00:00:55.429> around<00:00:55.519> and<00:00:55.999> when<00:00:56.960> you<00:00:56.989> see<00:00:57.890> both<00:00:58.039> the

00:00:58.209 --> 00:00:58.219 
flip it around and when you see both the

00:00:58.219 --> 00:00:59.319 
flip it around and when you see both the
blades<00:00:58.460> that's<00:00:58.730> going<00:00:58.910> to<00:00:58.969> give<00:00:59.120> you<00:00:59.210> the

00:00:59.319 --> 00:00:59.329 
blades that's going to give you the

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:02.139 
blades that's going to give you the
tongue<00:00:59.570> up<00:01:00.350> the<00:01:00.499> middle<00:01:00.800> hit<00:01:01.609> the<00:01:01.730> fence<00:01:01.940> on

00:01:02.139 --> 00:01:02.149 
tongue up the middle hit the fence on

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:09.040 
tongue up the middle hit the fence on
and<00:01:02.300> it<00:01:02.390> will<00:01:02.449> just<00:01:03.400> top<00:01:04.400> out<00:01:04.960> kind<00:01:05.960> of<00:01:08.050> and

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:09.050 
and it will just top out kind of and

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:12.460 
and it will just top out kind of and
well<00:01:09.200> one<00:01:09.710> good<00:01:09.920> idea<00:01:10.220> is<00:01:10.310> to<00:01:10.460> get<00:01:10.580> some<00:01:11.470> some

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:12.470 
well one good idea is to get some some

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:14.230 
well one good idea is to get some some
kind<00:01:12.650> of<00:01:12.680> oil<00:01:12.860> or<00:01:13.070> grease<00:01:13.250> or<00:01:13.490> mutton<00:01:14.060> tallow

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:14.240 
kind of oil or grease or mutton tallow

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:20.530 
kind of oil or grease or mutton tallow
or<00:01:14.770> mutton<00:01:15.770> fat<00:01:17.560> just<00:01:19.210> grease<00:01:20.210> the<00:01:20.390> skids

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:20.540 
or mutton fat just grease the skids

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:23.520 
or mutton fat just grease the skids
there<00:01:20.990> and<00:01:21.140> make<00:01:21.800> it<00:01:21.950> cut<00:01:22.160> a<00:01:22.190> lot<00:01:22.370> easier<00:01:22.760> you

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:23.530 
there and make it cut a lot easier you

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:31.380 
there and make it cut a lot easier you
can<00:01:24.530> see<00:01:24.800> that<00:01:26.110> so<00:01:28.360> before<00:01:29.360> that<00:01:29.630> will<00:01:29.870> work<00:01:29.990> oh

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:31.390 
can see that so before that will work oh

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:47.530 
can see that so before that will work oh
yeah<00:01:32.390> much<00:01:32.600> easier

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:47.540 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:54.889 

[Music]

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:57.029 

so<00:01:55.899> the<00:01:56.020> grooves<00:01:56.229> are<00:01:56.380> a<00:01:56.439> little<00:01:56.530> bit<00:01:56.710> harder

00:01:57.029 --> 00:01:57.039 
so the grooves are a little bit harder

00:01:57.039 --> 00:02:01.230 
so the grooves are a little bit harder
we'll<00:01:57.399> flip<00:01:57.610> this<00:01:57.789> around<00:01:59.729> you<00:02:00.729> can<00:02:00.880> see<00:02:01.119> it's

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:01.240 
we'll flip this around you can see it's

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:04.889 
we'll flip this around you can see it's
going<00:02:01.750> to<00:02:01.840> be<00:02:01.899> cutting<00:02:03.149> just<00:02:04.149> one<00:02:04.600> down<00:02:04.780> the

00:02:04.889 --> 00:02:04.899 
going to be cutting just one down the

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:08.100 
going to be cutting just one down the
middle<00:02:05.140> I<00:02:06.270> groove<00:02:07.270> Ora

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:08.110 
middle I groove Ora

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:10.350 
middle I groove Ora
yeah<00:02:08.560> I<00:02:08.590> groove<00:02:08.950> I<00:02:09.220> get<00:02:09.819> that<00:02:09.970> side<00:02:10.179> of<00:02:10.299> the

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:10.360 
yeah I groove I get that side of the

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:13.440 
yeah I groove I get that side of the
fence<00:02:10.509> too<00:02:11.099> and<00:02:12.099> I'll<00:02:12.220> get<00:02:12.970> the<00:02:13.090> other<00:02:13.180> board

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
fence too and I'll get the other board

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:18.900 
fence too and I'll get the other board
and<00:02:13.599> set<00:02:13.750> it<00:02:13.840> up<00:02:13.930> in<00:02:14.080> here<00:02:17.280> okay<00:02:18.310> and<00:02:18.579> just<00:02:18.790> so<00:02:18.880> I

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:18.910 
and set it up in here okay and just so I

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:20.280 
and set it up in here okay and just so I
don't<00:02:19.030> get<00:02:19.269> mixed<00:02:19.450> up<00:02:19.750> sometimes<00:02:19.989> I'll<00:02:20.260> just

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290 
don't get mixed up sometimes I'll just

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:23.430 
don't get mixed up sometimes I'll just
like<00:02:20.560> to<00:02:20.680> take<00:02:20.890> the<00:02:21.840> take<00:02:22.840> the<00:02:22.870> plane<00:02:23.170> and<00:02:23.200> just

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.440 
like to take the take the plane and just

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:26.490 
like to take the take the plane and just
kind<00:02:23.650> of<00:02:23.709> scratch<00:02:24.010> it<00:02:24.190> along<00:02:24.430> that<00:02:25.140> way<00:02:26.140> just

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500 
kind of scratch it along that way just

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.250 
kind of scratch it along that way just
so<00:02:26.590> I<00:02:26.620> can<00:02:26.739> make<00:02:26.860> sure<00:02:27.010> that<00:02:27.160> I've<00:02:27.400> got<00:02:27.430> it<00:02:28.260> so

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
so I can make sure that I've got it so

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.039 
so I can make sure that I've got it so
you<00:02:29.290> can<00:02:29.769> see<00:02:30.099> that<00:02:30.370> yes<00:02:30.670> that<00:02:30.970> is<00:02:31.209> the<00:02:31.900> right

00:02:32.039 --> 00:02:32.049 
you can see that yes that is the right

00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:34.110 
you can see that yes that is the right
direction<00:02:32.200> I'm<00:02:33.069> going<00:02:33.400> to<00:02:33.459> concentrate<00:02:33.849> on

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.120 
direction I'm going to concentrate on

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:36.380 
direction I'm going to concentrate on
really<00:02:34.269> keeping<00:02:34.630> the<00:02:35.140> fence<00:02:35.410> quest<00:02:35.739> against

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
really keeping the fence quest against

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:50.309 
really keeping the fence quest against
the<00:02:37.390> the<00:02:37.989> workpiece<00:02:48.840> try<00:02:49.840> to<00:02:49.900> get<00:02:50.079> the<00:02:50.139> nice

00:02:50.309 --> 00:02:50.319 
the the workpiece try to get the nice

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:58.319 
the the workpiece try to get the nice
and<00:02:50.530> square<00:02:56.549> it's<00:02:57.549> like<00:02:57.700> we're<00:02:58.120> probably
