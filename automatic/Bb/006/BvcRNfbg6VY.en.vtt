00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:53.459 
cab to begin with is just exactly it's
sort<00:01:51.729> of<00:01:51.759> a<00:01:51.850> joke<00:01:52.060> yeah<00:01:52.420> they<00:01:52.869> put<00:01:53.049> a<00:01:53.079> seat<00:01:53.289> back

00:01:53.459 --> 00:01:53.469 
sort of a joke yeah they put a seat back

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:54.749 
sort of a joke yeah they put a seat back
there<00:01:53.500> probably<00:01:54.189> for<00:01:54.399> some<00:01:54.549> sort<00:01:54.700> of

00:01:54.749 --> 00:01:54.759 
there probably for some sort of

00:01:54.759 --> 00:01:56.550 
there probably for some sort of
insurance<00:01:54.909> purposes<00:01:55.390> it's<00:01:55.780> really<00:01:56.020> for<00:01:56.229> show

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:56.560 
insurance purposes it's really for show

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:58.919 
insurance purposes it's really for show
yeah<00:01:56.740> for<00:01:57.009> sure<00:01:57.159> and<00:01:57.429> it's<00:01:58.329> really<00:01:58.570> not

00:01:58.919 --> 00:01:58.929 
yeah for sure and it's really not

00:01:58.929 --> 00:02:00.719 
yeah for sure and it's really not
intended<00:01:59.200> for<00:01:59.380> humans<00:01:59.859> to<00:02:00.009> sit<00:02:00.429> back<00:02:00.549> there

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:00.729 
intended for humans to sit back there

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:02.550 
intended for humans to sit back there
and<00:02:00.789> that's<00:02:01.030> like<00:02:01.149> it's<00:02:01.450> it's<00:02:01.840> strictly<00:02:02.229> for

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:02.560 
and that's like it's it's strictly for

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:04.889 
and that's like it's it's strictly for
for<00:02:03.520> insurance<00:02:03.880> purposes<00:02:04.119> there's<00:02:04.539> something

00:02:04.889 --> 00:02:04.899 
for insurance purposes there's something

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:08.190 
for insurance purposes there's something
crazy<00:02:05.020> really<00:02:05.609> so<00:02:06.609> the<00:02:07.329> next<00:02:07.509> one<00:02:07.689> we<00:02:07.810> have<00:02:07.840> is

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:08.200 
crazy really so the next one we have is

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:11.010 
crazy really so the next one we have is
Ford<00:02:08.830> Ford<00:02:09.550> is<00:02:09.789> a<00:02:09.820> little<00:02:10.780> bit<00:02:10.869> more

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:11.020 
Ford Ford is a little bit more

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:12.570 
Ford Ford is a little bit more
complicated<00:02:11.350> but<00:02:11.710> not<00:02:11.770> quite<00:02:12.130> as<00:02:12.280> as

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:12.580 
complicated but not quite as as

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:14.490 
complicated but not quite as as
complicated<00:02:12.940> as<00:02:13.210> done<00:02:13.390> not<00:02:13.690> the<00:02:13.840> worst<00:02:14.020> yeah

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:14.500 
complicated as done not the worst yeah

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:16.800 
complicated as done not the worst yeah
the<00:02:14.890> worst<00:02:15.130> dodge<00:02:15.460> is<00:02:15.730> by<00:02:15.880> far<00:02:16.150> the<00:02:16.180> trickiest

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:16.810 
the worst dodge is by far the trickiest

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:20.040 
the worst dodge is by far the trickiest
so<00:02:17.590> with<00:02:17.740> Ford's<00:02:18.130> you<00:02:18.700> have<00:02:18.880> a<00:02:19.090> regular<00:02:19.840> cab

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:20.050 
so with Ford's you have a regular cab

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:22.350 
so with Ford's you have a regular cab
you<00:02:20.560> have<00:02:20.650> a<00:02:20.710> super<00:02:21.100> cab<00:02:21.310> and<00:02:21.580> you<00:02:22.180> have<00:02:22.330> a

super crew cab yeah this is probably one

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:27.550 
of the most confusing ones because they

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:29.070 
of the most confusing ones because they
put<00:02:27.670> super<00:02:27.970> and<00:02:28.090> everything<00:02:28.390> yeah<00:02:28.780> you<00:02:28.840> have

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:48.400 
the confusion yes absolutely

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:51.390 
the confusion yes absolutely
but<00:02:48.849> yeah<00:02:48.970> the<00:02:49.120> regular<00:02:49.450> cab<00:02:49.659> is<00:02:50.280> what<00:02:51.280> you

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.400 
but yeah the regular cab is what you

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:52.460 
but yeah the regular cab is what you
would<00:02:51.489> expect<00:02:51.819> it's<00:02:52.060> sort<00:02:52.239> of<00:02:52.269> a

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
would expect it's sort of a

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:57.300 
would expect it's sort of a
regular-sized<00:02:53.470> cab<00:02:53.769> no<00:02:54.159> back<00:02:54.370> seat<00:02:55.079> from<00:02:56.310> 2004

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.310 
regular-sized cab no back seat from 2004

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:59.399 
regular-sized cab no back seat from 2004
and<00:02:57.640> newer<00:02:57.940> they<00:02:58.540> had<00:02:58.720> to<00:02:58.810> be<00:02:58.930> a<00:02:58.959> little

00:02:59.399 --> 00:02:59.409 
and newer they had to be a little

00:02:59.409 --> 00:03:01.289 
and newer they had to be a little
trickier<00:02:59.829> yeah<00:03:00.220> it's<00:03:00.459> a<00:03:00.549> little<00:03:00.760> bit<00:03:00.879> trickier

00:03:01.289 --> 00:03:01.299 
trickier yeah it's a little bit trickier

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:03.539 
trickier yeah it's a little bit trickier
where<00:03:01.540> the<00:03:01.900> regular<00:03:02.290> cab<00:03:02.470> actually<00:03:02.980> does<00:03:03.220> have

00:03:03.539 --> 00:03:03.549 
where the regular cab actually does have

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:06.690 
where the regular cab actually does have
rear<00:03:04.390> doors<00:03:05.170> but<00:03:05.859> they're<00:03:05.980> only<00:03:06.159> a<00:03:06.310> few<00:03:06.519> inches

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:06.700 
rear doors but they're only a few inches

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:08.550 
rear doors but they're only a few inches
long<00:03:07.000> right<00:03:07.420> so<00:03:07.720> what<00:03:07.900> you<00:03:08.019> typically

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:08.560 
long right so what you typically

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:10.259 
long right so what you typically
consider<00:03:08.950> an<00:03:09.099> extended<00:03:09.519> cab<00:03:09.700> with<00:03:10.120> those

00:03:10.259 --> 00:03:10.269 
consider an extended cab with those

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:12.330 
consider an extended cab with those
extra<00:03:10.540> doors<00:03:10.810> is<00:03:11.079> actually<00:03:11.799> not<00:03:11.920> the<00:03:12.099> case

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:12.340 
extra doors is actually not the case

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:14.729 
extra doors is actually not the case
yeah<00:03:12.760> they<00:03:13.690> made<00:03:13.900> it<00:03:13.989> a<00:03:14.049> little<00:03:14.079> easier<00:03:14.409> to

00:03:14.729 --> 00:03:14.739 
yeah they made it a little easier to

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:16.830 
yeah they made it a little easier to
figure<00:03:15.250> out<00:03:15.370> if<00:03:15.579> you<00:03:15.760> only<00:03:15.940> have<00:03:16.150> one<00:03:16.540> set<00:03:16.720> of

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:16.840 
figure out if you only have one set of

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:19.319 
figure out if you only have one set of
seats<00:03:16.989> that's<00:03:17.590> the<00:03:18.040> regular<00:03:18.340> cab<00:03:18.519> yes<00:03:19.030> if<00:03:19.209> you

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:19.329 
seats that's the regular cab yes if you

00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:21.030 
seats that's the regular cab yes if you
have<00:03:19.540> a<00:03:19.780> second<00:03:20.260> row<00:03:20.349> of<00:03:20.500> seats<00:03:20.709> that's

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:21.040 
have a second row of seats that's

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:22.410 
have a second row of seats that's
actually<00:03:21.340> a<00:03:21.370> steady<00:03:21.639> cab<00:03:21.879> those<00:03:22.090> doors<00:03:22.299> are<00:03:22.359> a

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:22.420 
actually a steady cab those doors are a

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:24.479 
actually a steady cab those doors are a
little<00:03:22.659> bit<00:03:22.750> bigger<00:03:22.930> right<00:03:23.590> and<00:03:23.950> by<00:03:24.129> extended

00:03:24.479 --> 00:03:24.489 
little bit bigger right and by extended

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:28.140 
little bit bigger right and by extended
cab<00:03:24.639> you<00:03:24.790> mean<00:03:24.970> super<00:03:25.389> cab<00:03:25.629> yes<00:03:25.959> yes<00:03:27.000> so<00:03:28.000> yeah

00:05:10.289 --> 00:05:12.080 
there's no doors exactly so which is why
they<00:05:10.470> made<00:05:10.590> the<00:05:10.710> quad<00:05:10.949> cab<00:05:11.220> so<00:05:11.789> it's<00:05:11.940> their

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:12.090 
they made the quad cab so it's their

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:14.779 
they made the quad cab so it's their
extended<00:05:12.419> cab<00:05:12.660> with<00:05:13.590> the<00:05:13.620> doors<00:05:13.949> yes<00:05:14.520> exactly

the back of it as well so it's probably

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:28.700
