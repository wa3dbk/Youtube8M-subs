00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
themselves available so there was a lot

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.830 
themselves available so there was a lot
of<00:01:43.799> movement<00:01:44.340> off<00:01:44.490> the<00:01:44.520> ball<00:01:44.729> so<00:01:45.210> we<00:01:45.329> found<00:01:45.630> our

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
of movement off the ball so we found our

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.600 
of movement off the ball so we found our
people<00:01:46.350> you<00:01:46.439> know<00:01:46.590> in<00:01:46.619> midfield<00:01:46.950> or<00:01:47.220> even<00:01:47.490> up

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.080 
many things really kind of reflected the
work<00:01:55.470> on<00:01:55.710> the<00:01:55.890> training<00:01:56.159> field<00:01:56.310> that<00:01:56.759> we<00:01:56.880> did

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
work on the training field that we did

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.209 
work on the training field that we did
over<00:01:57.210> the<00:01:57.390> last<00:01:57.420> four<00:01:57.869> weeks<00:01:58.110> now<00:01:58.710> obviously

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
over the last four weeks now obviously

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:01.969 
over the last four weeks now obviously
you<00:01:59.310> want<00:01:59.640> to<00:01:59.729> see<00:01:59.880> that<00:02:00.469> being<00:02:01.469> transferred

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
you want to see that being transferred

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.160 
you want to see that being transferred
into<00:02:02.219> the<00:02:02.340> next<00:02:02.610> opportunity<00:02:02.850> which<00:02:03.810> will<00:02:04.020> be

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
into the next opportunity which will be

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:05.749 
into the next opportunity which will be
in<00:02:04.259> the<00:02:04.320> beginning<00:02:04.680> of<00:02:04.770> march<00:02:05.009> in<00:02:05.219> the<00:02:05.310> Ukraine

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
in the beginning of march in the Ukraine

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:08.419 
in the beginning of march in the Ukraine
with<00:02:06.390> other<00:02:07.320> players<00:02:07.710> coming<00:02:08.039> into<00:02:08.399> that

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
with other players coming into that

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:11.600 
with other players coming into that
group<00:02:08.759> again<00:02:09.229> so<00:02:10.229> I<00:02:10.619> I<00:02:10.649> think<00:02:11.370> it<00:02:11.459> was<00:02:11.580> a

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
group again so I I think it was a

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.430 
group again so I I think it was a
positive<00:02:11.910> first<00:02:12.390> step<00:02:12.569> in<00:02:13.020> two<00:02:13.170> hours

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
positive first step in two hours

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.190 
positive first step in two hours
14<00:02:13.950> i<00:02:14.220> think<00:02:14.850> it's<00:02:14.970> a<00:02:15.090> it's<00:02:15.120> a<00:02:15.450> huge<00:02:15.720> compliment

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
14 i think it's a it's a huge compliment

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.520 
14 i think it's a it's a huge compliment
to<00:02:16.440> the<00:02:16.470> fans<00:02:16.860> and<00:02:17.610> also<00:02:18.210> to<00:02:18.990> the<00:02:19.110> fact<00:02:19.410> that

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
to the fans and also to the fact that

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.170 
to the fans and also to the fact that
you<00:02:19.920> know<00:02:19.980> people<00:02:20.070> really<00:02:20.670> notice<00:02:21.030> this

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
you know people really notice this

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.000 
you know people really notice this
national<00:02:21.660> team<00:02:21.900> people<00:02:22.320> really<00:02:22.650> kind<00:02:22.890> of

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
national team people really kind of

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:25.480 
national team people really kind of
follow<00:02:23.820> this<00:02:24.210> team<00:02:24.480> now<00:02:24.630> more<00:02:25.230> and<00:02:25.320> more

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:25.490 
follow this team now more and more

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:28.190 
follow this team now more and more
closely<00:02:26.490> not<00:02:27.030> only<00:02:27.270> because<00:02:27.570> there's<00:02:27.780> a<00:02:27.840> World

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
closely not only because there's a World

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:29.600 
closely not only because there's a World

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
Cup coming up this summer but I think

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:33.800 
Cup coming up this summer but I think
also<00:02:30.030> that<00:02:30.740> they<00:02:31.740> can<00:02:31.950> see<00:02:32.100> a<00:02:32.390> progress<00:02:33.390> they

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
also that they can see a progress they

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:36.140 
also that they can see a progress they
can<00:02:34.020> see<00:02:34.260> something<00:02:35.010> is<00:02:35.100> happening<00:02:35.700> in<00:02:36.060> this

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
can see something is happening in this

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.690 
can see something is happening in this

it's not the first South Korean roster

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:13.430 
it's not the first South Korean roster
because<00:03:11.670> also<00:03:12.060> their<00:03:12.360> guys<00:03:12.570> play<00:03:12.960> mainly<00:03:13.200> in

Europe and we have a sellout and we have

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:17.720 
Europe and we have a sellout and we have
a<00:03:15.480> tremendous<00:03:15.780> support<00:03:16.590> great<00:03:17.070> atmosphere<00:03:17.310> in

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 
a tremendous support great atmosphere in

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:19.610 
a tremendous support great atmosphere in
the<00:03:17.820> stadium<00:03:18.120> it's<00:03:18.480> really<00:03:18.810> was<00:03:19.020> a<00:03:19.050> great<00:03:19.140> bus

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620 
the stadium it's really was a great bus

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:23.030 
the stadium it's really was a great bus
from<00:03:19.890> from<00:03:20.820> the<00:03:20.970> beginning<00:03:21.420> on<00:03:21.570> so<00:03:22.290> I<00:03:22.709> think

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
from from the beginning on so I think

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:26.479 
from from the beginning on so I think
you<00:03:23.459> know<00:03:23.489> it<00:03:24.030> kind<00:03:24.720> of<00:03:24.830> just<00:03:25.830> confirms<00:03:26.310> that
