00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:16.869
 in front of you is a beautiful stylish 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:20.560
 very light green baby park 

00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:23.340
 the bike is agang exe 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:23.340
 26 views 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:38.790
 agang 26 inches which agang exe 10 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:41.489
 2014 and this bike there is a big 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:44.160
 and the long problem let's start with 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:46.940
 long problem back triangle 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:51.150
 the bike has a length of 400 millimeters 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:55.019
 wheel position itself and this 

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:56.760
 by almost three and a half to three 

00:00:55.019 --> 00:00:58.800
 centimeter bedrooms longer than mine 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.559
 exo store with flowing hole sticks 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.690
 now I have a wheel away 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:05.940
 there is a position somewhere 415 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.220
 imagine my emotions from trying 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:10.530
 do tricks on it 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:13.740
 front triangle has a length of 583 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:16.979
 millimeter and it's almost three centimeters 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:21.570
 longer than on exo store google 0 here 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:24.720
 70 degrees no claim material 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:26.790
 temple frame 4130 double boot is not here 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:29.369
 get to the bottom for what but by itself 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.930
 very huge he is very big it 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:33.090
 some star 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.360
 he is excellent for takeoff stable 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:38.100
 air leg deal us on such a roll and 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:40.170
 buying a newcomer will not be able to 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.570
 appreciate all its benefits if 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:45.080
 of course he does not buy it perhaps for the sake of 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:48.180
 frames of pedal wheels of their saddle 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:50.670
 perhaps now steering with the removal but for sure 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:52.700
 not for the sleeves and not for the rods they are on 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:55.620
 it is completely parallel 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:59.010
 let's go now to heavy 

00:01:55.620 --> 00:02:01.080
 problem to big this fork here in 

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:03.240
 for the damn fashion 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:05.220
 quite logical and sensible articles smoking room 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.320
 put your bike on and it's a shredded bike 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:08.819
 the first place 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:11.009
 plug work out irregularities soften 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:11.580
 landing but never in it 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:15.629
 settings 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:23.640
 she's type of oil called arrest goes 

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:27.240
 but so rebound they are bred and weight 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:29.340
 you forks just one problem another 

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:30.540
 the problem is her price to put this 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:33.810
 a fork on this bike 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:36.170
 they had to save on their sleeves 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:39.120
 had to save on rods 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:42.510
 this is quite important bike knots in 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:44.430
 as a result, we get in conjunction with this fork 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:46.290
 on the tenth axis which is practically not 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:48.780
 it works only on landing something 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:50.340
 work out on departures and turns 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:52.650
 which it only hinders it 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:55.560
 pushes me away and wants to throw in 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:58.040
 flat it infuriated me in general this 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:00.840
 the plug goes with the front hub under 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:03.120
 disc brake 10 millimeters on the axis on 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:05.700
 nuts on the balls stukanula main they even 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:08.670
 agang stickers no back sleeve too 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:10.800
 on balls and 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:13.110
 On the axis, thank God for nuts, that is, it 

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:15.150
 don't worry dropout ah she was originally with 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:18.150
 drum under the tape is not just worth it 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:20.459
 the family sleeps whale okay by itself 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:23.130
 singlespeed whale is not so bad but 

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:25.050
 it makes sleeve flanges lie 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:29.220
 close to each other which reduces 

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:31.019
 wheel stiffness on the side bushing sleeve 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:34.860
 naturally disc brake disc 

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:37.380
 this brake on it is worth it I took it off for 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:39.299
 the cleanliness of the test because with the brakes 

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:41.459
 not used to ride even if the brake 

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:43.680
 the pen will be under my left hand I don't care 

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:45.120
 I can not concentrate as 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:47.970
 follow bikes she will stream me 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:50.940
 distract so there broke up the despector 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:53.820
 a shark mechanic who in general 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:56.040
 acceptable working here is worth a new 

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:58.799
 steering wheel I don't know how it changed in 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:00.510
 his strength but he became higher 

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:02.340
 he now has a rise and glory to god and 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:04.739
 have time somehow twitches if necessary 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:08.459
 make bonik you us pads with lifting 

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:13.470
 agang tires changed instead of power 

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:14.120
 the blocks now here are hex and k and they look like 

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:16.979
 on 

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:18.870
 what is called continental flights to 

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:20.370
 something reminds me of a protector in 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:23.640
 in general, they can be put in both directions 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:26.010
 i.e. either tread away from yourself or 

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:28.350
 yourself and this will change the properties 

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:31.280
 tires either more hook or more 

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:33.770
 on cad in general 

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:37.180
 on the ground on it to go will zashib but 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:39.710
 pancake on asphalt and on the figures of the park there 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:41.480
 if you want to park on it or 

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:44.389
 so fan box with the rest risen necessary 

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:46.970
 change it terrible for this rim 

00:04:44.389 --> 00:04:49.550
 double agang reverse they go light to 

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:51.370
 fork except for pedals in general, to the gods 

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:54.230
 no complaints 

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:56.210
 pedals cool eat plastic for promo in 

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:57.020
 320 grams total weighs the same as on 

00:04:56.210 --> 00:05:00.380
 my bike 

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:04.580
 excellent rods system of rods 

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:07.820
 this is gravity stepan this is some 

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:09.290
 aluminum hrenaten and which is not 

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:11.090
 too comfortable mouth catch vip on 

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:12.740
 which is a big star in general 

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:14.840
 she stands here because she stands behind 

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:17.030
 singlespeed ki with a big star just 

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:19.070
 it will not be possible to screw on 

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:21.290
 cycling how to accelerate if 

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:23.000
 the star will be small actually smaller 

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:26.630
 than this star here on this system is not 

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.860
 put it a failure I think I hope 

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:29.750
 what next year will be here already 

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:33.050
 put paper system connecting rod bushing by 

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:34.639
 driver plug either hard or by 20 by 

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:37.160
 least i will make everything possible that 

00:05:34.639 --> 00:05:40.820
 it was like that, but does it make sense 

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:43.450
 Bike this year makes sense at the very 

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:46.570
 In fact there is but only for those who 

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:49.729
 deliberately going to cat dick and 

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:51.560
 understands what he needs in a good basis 

00:05:49.729 --> 00:05:54.410
 frame with berkovoy geometry made of 

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:58.090
 temple 4130 frame that will hold 

00:05:54.410 --> 00:06:01.610
 and in general, there is a foundation here 

00:05:58.090 --> 00:06:03.350
 good seating is not necessary 

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:06.260
 will change abbado with tires and 

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:10.010
 pedals will need to change the plug bushings 

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:13.400
 and the system in general, when compared with 

00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:15.950
 near the temple do you gather it to you 

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:17.150
 metropolis am3 then of course this weight is 5 

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:19.520
 Looks more profitable in the fact that the low gram 

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:21.919
 at least lame lego i'm half there 

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:24.200
 Shaytanovy you table 3 

00:06:21.919 --> 00:06:27.500
 there is a rebound adjustment on this plug 

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:30.979
 the growth of the shit that of course makes her 

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:32.960
 work work is quite acceptable but 

00:06:30.979 --> 00:06:35.210
 tell me why you need to overpay for 

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:37.550
 rebound on the fork which originally you 

00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:39.680
 do not need and breaks just torsion 

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:42.670
 loads fast enough 

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:45.820
 expert weight 14 kg 

00:06:42.670 --> 00:06:47.620
 and do tricks on it 

00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:50.370
 some are tense but in general he is not 

00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:53.080
 dangling the air spinning can 

00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:57.360
 relatively convenient to set set 

00:06:53.080 --> 00:07:01.420
 the back comfortably least bothered me 

00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:03.910
 Generally in flights when on combines 

00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:05.680
 I ride that you take off it happens 

00:07:03.910 --> 00:07:06.850
 that having time for sausages to have time is unusual 

00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:09.640
 it does not feel it is felt immediately 

00:07:06.850 --> 00:07:11.620
 long everything is clear but aspen do 

00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:14.950
 uncomfortable steering very wide 740 this 

00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:16.240
 just some pizdets sorry anohin 

00:07:14.950 --> 00:07:17.950
 do ok actually more 

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:20.590
 no tricks I'm on it today and no business 

00:07:17.950 --> 00:07:22.780
 manul I felt well I do not know the attempt 

00:07:20.590 --> 00:07:24.070
 with 10 I will honestly tell you to throw out the bonik 

00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:27.130
 made a second attempt 

00:07:24.070 --> 00:07:29.650
 he is more comfortable than last year’s 

00:07:27.130 --> 00:07:32.529
 perspective even in this form in which 

00:07:29.650 --> 00:07:34.949
 Now we will be next year 

00:07:32.529 --> 00:07:34.949
 will become 

00:07:35.190 --> 00:07:43.770
 simon data stepans agang exe 26 

00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:46.069
 inches 2014 and to salad 

00:07:43.770 --> 00:07:46.069
 bye everyone
