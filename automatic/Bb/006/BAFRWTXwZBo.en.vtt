00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:03.780 
today I'm going to show you how to do an

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:07.700 
today I'm going to show you how to do an
electrostatic<00:00:04.259> discharge<00:00:05.040> on<00:00:05.339> a<00:00:05.400> computer<00:00:06.710> if

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:07.710 
electrostatic discharge on a computer if

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:09.620 
electrostatic discharge on a computer if
you<00:00:07.830> ever<00:00:07.980> have<00:00:08.130> a<00:00:08.160> computer<00:00:08.580> or<00:00:08.730> laptop<00:00:08.910> that

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:09.630 
you ever have a computer or laptop that

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:11.690 
you ever have a computer or laptop that
won't<00:00:09.929> turn<00:00:10.170> on<00:00:10.200> you<00:00:11.010> press<00:00:11.280> the<00:00:11.400> power<00:00:11.580> button

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700 
won't turn on you press the power button

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.980 
won't turn on you press the power button
nothing<00:00:12.570> happens<00:00:13.139> it's<00:00:13.860> dead<00:00:14.719> before<00:00:15.719> you<00:00:15.809> set

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
nothing happens it's dead before you set

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.099 
nothing happens it's dead before you set
it<00:00:16.080> up<00:00:16.170> for<00:00:16.379> service<00:00:16.800> try<00:00:17.699> this<00:00:17.779> now

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
it up for service try this now

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:21.050 
it up for service try this now
I<00:00:19.140> take<00:00:19.560> calls<00:00:19.830> from<00:00:19.980> people<00:00:20.189> all<00:00:20.520> day<00:00:20.699> every

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
I take calls from people all day every

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.150 
I take calls from people all day every
day<00:00:21.090> who<00:00:21.750> think<00:00:22.050> they<00:00:22.199> know<00:00:22.350> how<00:00:22.529> to<00:00:22.590> do<00:00:22.859> this

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
day who think they know how to do this

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.779 
day who think they know how to do this
and<00:00:23.490> they<00:00:24.210> have<00:00:24.359> no<00:00:24.570> clue<00:00:25.400> first<00:00:26.400> thing<00:00:26.699> you

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
and they have no clue first thing you

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:28.550 
and they have no clue first thing you
want<00:00:26.970> to<00:00:27.029> do<00:00:27.240> is<00:00:27.420> disconnect<00:00:28.019> the<00:00:28.470> power

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
want to do is disconnect the power

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.820 
want to do is disconnect the power
source<00:00:29.039> from<00:00:29.250> the<00:00:29.340> wall<00:00:30.590> second<00:00:31.590> thing<00:00:31.740> you

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
source from the wall second thing you

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.410 
source from the wall second thing you
want<00:00:31.859> to<00:00:32.099> do<00:00:32.219> is<00:00:32.399> take<00:00:32.640> the<00:00:32.820> battery<00:00:33.149> out<00:00:33.180> of

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
want to do is take the battery out of

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:41.209 
want to do is take the battery out of
the<00:00:33.510> unit<00:00:39.379> okay<00:00:40.379> now<00:00:40.649> you're<00:00:40.890> going<00:00:40.980> to<00:00:41.070> want

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
the unit okay now you're going to want

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:44.150 
the unit okay now you're going to want
to<00:00:41.280> hold<00:00:41.430> the<00:00:41.610> power<00:00:41.760> button<00:00:41.910> down<00:00:42.329> for<00:00:43.160> at

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
to hold the power button down for at

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.639 
to hold the power button down for at
least<00:00:44.250> thirty<00:00:44.610> seconds<00:00:45.260> now<00:00:46.260> this<00:00:46.500> is

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
least thirty seconds now this is

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:49.400 
least thirty seconds now this is
important<00:00:47.160> because<00:00:47.340> this<00:00:48.270> is<00:00:48.329> actually<00:00:48.690> where

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
important because this is actually where

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.819 
important because this is actually where
the<00:00:50.340> electrostatic<00:00:51.270> charge<00:00:51.899> gets<00:00:52.379> dissipated

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
the electrostatic charge gets dissipated

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.830 
the electrostatic charge gets dissipated
believe<00:00:53.730> it<00:00:53.850> or<00:00:53.940> not<00:00:54.059> by<00:00:54.270> holding<00:00:54.600> the<00:00:54.690> power

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
believe it or not by holding the power

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.720 
believe it or not by holding the power
button<00:00:54.960> down<00:00:55.379> you<00:00:55.410> basically<00:00:56.010> drain<00:00:56.370> whatever

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
button down you basically drain whatever

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.599 
button down you basically drain whatever
charge<00:00:57.030> is<00:00:57.210> left<00:00:57.360> in<00:00:57.570> the<00:00:57.660> unit<00:00:58.340> now<00:00:59.340> we're<00:00:59.520> not

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
charge is left in the unit now we're not

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.220 
charge is left in the unit now we're not
going<00:00:59.760> to<00:00:59.850> do<00:00:59.969> this<00:01:00.090> for<00:01:00.329> 30<00:01:00.510> seconds<00:01:01.020> but<00:01:01.109> if

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
going to do this for 30 seconds but if

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.319 
going to do this for 30 seconds but if
you<00:01:01.350> really<00:01:01.530> have<00:01:01.800> this<00:01:01.949> problem<00:01:02.219> go<00:01:03.210> ahead

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
you really have this problem go ahead

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.420 
you really have this problem go ahead
and<00:01:03.600> hold<00:01:03.719> it<00:01:03.870> for<00:01:03.989> 30<00:01:04.049> Cal<00:01:04.799> hold<00:01:05.100> it<00:01:05.220> for<00:01:05.400> a

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
and hold it for 30 Cal hold it for a

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.149 
and hold it for 30 Cal hold it for a
minute<00:01:05.610> it<00:01:05.939> ain't<00:01:06.180> gonna<00:01:06.299> hurt<00:01:06.510> nothing

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:07.159 
minute it ain't gonna hurt nothing

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:09.890 
minute it ain't gonna hurt nothing
now<00:01:08.159> here's<00:01:08.790> the<00:01:08.909> second<00:01:09.299> most<00:01:09.420> important

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
now here's the second most important

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.140 
now here's the second most important
thing<00:01:09.930> people<00:01:10.260> get<00:01:10.500> wrong<00:01:10.850> after<00:01:11.850> you<00:01:11.909> take

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
thing people get wrong after you take

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:13.850 
thing people get wrong after you take
the<00:01:12.330> battery<00:01:12.780> out<00:01:12.840> and<00:01:13.200> you've<00:01:13.530> held<00:01:13.740> this

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
the battery out and you've held this

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.679 
the battery out and you've held this
down<00:01:14.130> for<00:01:14.549> the<00:01:14.670> thirty<00:01:14.909> seconds<00:01:15.390> to<00:01:15.509> one

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
down for the thirty seconds to one

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:16.210 
down for the thirty seconds to one
minute

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:16.220 
minute

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:19.850 
minute
don't<00:01:17.220> put<00:01:17.520> the<00:01:17.670> battery<00:01:18.060> back<00:01:18.090> in<00:01:18.509> yet<00:01:18.860> just

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
don't put the battery back in yet just

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:28.789 
don't put the battery back in yet just
plug<00:01:20.130> in<00:01:20.369> the<00:01:20.790> adapter<00:01:26.119> now<00:01:27.500> go<00:01:28.500> ahead<00:01:28.680> and

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799
