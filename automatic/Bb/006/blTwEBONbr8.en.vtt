00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:03.730 
Junior but it's been pretty obvious

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:05.070 
Junior but it's been pretty obvious
since<00:01:03.910> the<00:01:04.089> start<00:01:04.330> of<00:01:04.449> the<00:01:04.510> show<00:01:04.660> who<00:01:04.839> you're

objective<00:01:07.479> as<00:01:07.600> I<00:01:07.780> can<00:01:08.050> came<00:01:08.380> quite<00:01:09.340> frankly

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:09.760 
objective as I can came quite frankly

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:20.679

I'd<00:01:10.420> rather<00:01:10.450> see<00:01:10.869> a<00:01:10.900> good<00:01:11.229> comparative<00:01:11.740> match

00:01:20.679 --> 00:01:20.689 

00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:24.940 

it's<00:01:21.079> not<00:01:21.439> illegal

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:24.950 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:36.010 

textbook<00:01:25.939> reversal<00:01:26.780> thing<00:01:33.850> I<00:01:34.850> think<00:01:35.840> this

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:36.020 
textbook reversal thing I think this

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:38.350 
textbook reversal thing I think this
could<00:01:36.170> be<00:01:36.229> the<00:01:36.469> beginning<00:01:36.619> of<00:01:37.130> the<00:01:37.280> end<00:01:37.460> no<00:01:37.939> it

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:38.360 
could be the beginning of the end no it

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:40.719 
could be the beginning of the end no it
can't<00:01:38.689> end<00:01:38.810> like<00:01:38.899> this<00:01:39.020> come<00:01:39.829> on<00:01:39.950> do<00:01:40.280> something

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:40.729 
can't end like this come on do something

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:48.520 
can't end like this come on do something
quick<00:01:41.030> I<00:01:46.420> think<00:01:47.420> it's<00:01:47.750> pretty<00:01:47.899> obvious<00:01:48.020> which

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:48.530 
quick I think it's pretty obvious which

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:50.770 
quick I think it's pretty obvious which
way<00:01:48.679> this<00:01:48.860> one's<00:01:49.130> gonna<00:01:49.280> go<00:01:49.460> jr.<00:01:49.880> well<00:01:50.329> from

all<00:02:38.500> I<00:02:38.530> can<00:02:38.890> say<00:02:39.099> if<00:02:39.280> someone's<00:02:39.700> been<00:02:39.849> eating

intimate touch but I think these fans

intimate touch but I think these fans
are<00:02:52.000> too<00:02:52.180> stupid<00:02:52.510> to<00:02:52.750> realize<00:02:53.109> it<00:02:53.140> how<00:02:53.530> can<00:02:53.590> you
