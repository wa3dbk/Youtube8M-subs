00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:28.500
 if the petit fours the cookies that the example cook during the 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.149
 Feast of garlic r I offer shortbreads ona mint part 

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:38.600

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.760
 ingredients to make shortbread in a world 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.180
 even lagarde to do apart so for a signposted course and I chose 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:49.210
 percent to make a simple almond paste 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:53.960
 e a two-month break why a good dose of sugar with a little bit of 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:56.320
 butter and did not belong as usual 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:00.920
 orange blossom it encourages but you can very well barn the farc 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:03.920
 and put that part of the game 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:08.729
 that we see scented abete of the shot will shoot more otherwise you can very well 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.910
 if you do not want to put amended peanuts 

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:14.210
 both in the preparation of the 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:17.640
 and also for the game and we start right away with the list 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.729
 of ingredients and I'm going to need to do 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:26.740
 almond powder flour and there I took whole member states 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:30.119
 that I passed the mill of course we passed them in a clean cloth to 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:31.890
 remove all the little dust 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.200
 who has the following for three kilos if we take them the same 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.710
 to have an almond powder 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.130
 butter 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:40.170
 icing sugar 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:41.790
 I have 2 egg yolks 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.940
 distal and cinnamon when really in flower chanel perfumes 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:50.780
 from orange tree m to 6 and all this beautiful world works very very well together 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:54.070
 why the almond paste I will need pruned almonds 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:56.100
 moreover 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.660
 of orange flower buds 

00:01:58.660 --> 00:01:59.760
 of putty 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:02.680
 and as I explained at the beginning of the show that we can vary the 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:05.090
 pleasures in alternative scattered 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:08.190
 and I need some date paste that we buy from the prefects in the 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:09.439
 shops 

00:02:09.439 --> 00:02:13.529
 and we're going to leave but the date paste with our object round up I start the 

00:02:13.529 --> 00:02:16.529
 preparation in the game 

00:02:54.529 --> 00:02:55.729
 despite a good share 

00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:56.989
 lists 

00:02:56.989 --> 00:02:59.989
 a facade 300 members I go face to the nose and mouth 

00:03:06.059 --> 00:03:09.059
 in trying to make balls of the same size 

00:03:59.529 --> 00:04:03.239
 so I made balls of dough with amaranth wood paste 

00:04:03.839 --> 00:04:07.329
 then I worked almond paste with orange blossom water 

00:04:07.329 --> 00:04:12.869
 and even as well as I did it also shows aromatized and the dough of 

00:04:12.869 --> 00:04:17.239
 dates with the coup clove and I made small balls that 

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:21.000
 makes you say prank a little trick should save time and to 

00:04:20.999 --> 00:04:22.860
 see all of the same caliber 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:24.099
 to accompany him 

00:04:24.099 --> 00:04:26.979
 marzipan or any part of it 

00:04:26.979 --> 00:04:28.289
 in good condition 

00:04:28.289 --> 00:04:30.839
 and then you cut small pieces and in the end we wanted to roll 

00:04:30.839 --> 00:04:34.089
 as burden come and time and honor the little dumplings of the same 

00:04:34.089 --> 00:04:34.610
 caliber 

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:37.379
 use by moult power 

00:04:37.379 --> 00:04:40.710
 a ladle I do not know how my name is not currently explored 

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:41.990
 but here I am 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:45.550
 then she left for us to do the job 

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:50.080
 but it's really handy to make them distribute 

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:54.270
 and at the cinema for marie not control but somewhere from chart's 

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:57.360
 cookies we do not have yet when we do not have something of the most 

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:01.389
 early a crust of easter a craft a little and the interior is less 

00:05:01.389 --> 00:05:05.280
 high with that marzipan pro the date paste a last small 

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:10.000
 trick it takes bets but the mold to prevent the pac the task at 

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:10.839
 parlor 

00:05:10.839 --> 00:05:12.249
 and I start 

00:05:12.249 --> 00:05:15.249
 see the technique this page 

00:05:34.199 --> 00:05:38.199
 it is very hot it takes 182 snow to place the biscuits for a power 

00:05:38.199 --> 00:05:40.100
 which will last between 15 

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:43.100
 m 

00:05:49.589 --> 00:05:52.960
 as you've seen them sprinkle the cookies once since the care of 

00:05:52.959 --> 00:05:55.580
 cocoa powder is its date stuffed 

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:58.319
 otherwise icing sugar when stuffed 

00:05:58.319 --> 00:06:01.800
 we have an appointment with the pasta sam mendes is a very simple recipe and 

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:06.339
 easy is really delicious no matter what kind of part I hope 

00:06:06.339 --> 00:06:07.569
 that we will test it 

00:06:07.569 --> 00:06:10.930
 and in this sense advocating to note for the anecdote by the press 

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:11.620
 after Lille
