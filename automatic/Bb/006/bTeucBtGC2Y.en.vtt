00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:13.389
 insomniac games the creators of sagas 

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:15.219
 like resistance or ratchet and clank 

00:00:13.389 --> 00:00:16.840
 Last at the launch of your next 

00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:18.880
 action adventure that will come to us with 

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:20.349
 the name decides being the first title 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:22.720
 from this developer that is 

00:00:20.349 --> 00:00:25.320
 intended for xbox 360 in addition to 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:25.320
 Playstation 3 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.920
 the argument of the body takes place in 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.650
 a near future where a group called 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.840
 overstrike 9 formed by four people 

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:38.970
 elite chosen by the aunt will have the 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.160
 mission to recover a powerful source 

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:42.540
 of energy to the indigenous called fuse that 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.699
 fall into the hands of a mysterious 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.960
 enemy organization what puts the 

00:00:44.699 --> 00:00:47.960
 serious danger to all humanity 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:54.890
 specifically this team of heroes is 

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:58.130
 composed of dalton a mercenary 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:01:00.290
 reformed nadia a former murderer and a 

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:02.420
 young scientist with a lot of talent but 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:04.610
 very rebellious and a detective came 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:07.760
 decorated police although with too much 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:09.770
 character the four together will form 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:11.060
 a group of misfits with a strong 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:12.950
 tendency to completely ignore 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:14.900
 any kind of protocol though 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:16.760
 precisely this is what makes them 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:19.240
 perfect to carry out this 

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:19.240
 work 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:28.340
 Regarding the gameplay we 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:30.229
 we will find an action shooter in 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:31.820
 third person where the use predominates 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:33.890
 of the coverages which is 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:36.049
 especially thought to be played in 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:39.049
 cooperative online multiplayer mode by 

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:40.969
 up to 4 players it will be possible for a 

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:42.979
 user between saves from a game 

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:46.179
 already started without it stopping 

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:46.179
 the action in no time 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:49.150
 of year 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.360
 although of course we will also have the 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.280
 possibility of playing it alone 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.110
 having to mention as a curiosity 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.880
 which in this case will be the intelligence 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.440
 artificial one that controls the rest of 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.450
 our partners but having 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:04.890
 always the player the possibility of 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.570
 alternate and take control of 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.190
 any of them with just pressing 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:10.110
 a button so we will not be 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:14.209
 limited to having to play all the 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:14.209
 game with a certain character 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:20.390
 also as is usual in the 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:22.099
 gender each of the four 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:24.230
 protagonists of the adventure will have 

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:26.030
 weapons and own abilities since all 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:27.650
 they will be equipped with a very 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:30.640
 advanced experimental technology 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:30.640
 alien 

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:38.689
 in this way to give a dalton example 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:40.939
 can deploy a shield of energy that 

00:02:38.689 --> 00:02:42.859
 will protect you from shooting if you can 

00:02:40.939 --> 00:02:44.900
 heal wounded enemies from the 

00:02:42.859 --> 00:02:46.670
 distance while nobody will have 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:50.170
 of an optical camouflage that will 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:50.170
 invisible by the seconds 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:04.609
 we also tell you that next to the new 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:06.620
 cooperative campaign is also 

00:03:04.609 --> 00:03:08.269
 confirmed a second modality very 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:09.829
 similar to a horde mode where the 

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:11.989
 goal will be to survive 

00:03:09.829 --> 00:03:14.359
 countless waves of enemies every time 

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:16.430
 stronger being this a variant of 

00:03:14.359 --> 00:03:18.379
 game somewhat more competitive because although 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:20.420
 all players play the same 

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:22.989
 side must also strive to obtain 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:22.989
 the best score 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:32.160
 and precisely in relation to this it fits 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:34.050
 say that the game has mostly been 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:36.090
 designed to be very rejugable 

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:38.220
 since in addition to being able to climb 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:39.750
 level each character has a tree of 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:42.150
 skills that can be unlocked 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:43.950
 Don data without mentioning the fact that 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:45.810
 we will always win experiences without 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:48.380
 import in what game mode we are 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:48.380
 Playing 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:04.709
 and finally with regard to its section 

00:04:02.939 --> 00:04:06.480
 technical it is a title that if 

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:08.519
 well it seems will not come to surprise 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:10.109
 too visually itself shows a 

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:12.469
 correct level with some graphics 

00:04:10.109 --> 00:04:14.700
 colorful even with a light touch 

00:04:12.469 --> 00:04:16.590
 cartoonish having to add to everything 

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:18.479
 it a plot and dialogues that 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:20.519
 will be loaded with large doses of 

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:22.169
 humor just like insomniac games and we 

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:25.400
 he's used to in many of his 

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:25.400
 touch titles 

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:38.970
 reach the stores of europe of the 

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:41.669
 hand of electronic arts and destiny of 

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:44.190
 consoles xbox 360 and playstation 3 the 

00:04:41.669 --> 00:04:46.169
 next May 31 just three days 

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:48.289
 after its launch in the market
