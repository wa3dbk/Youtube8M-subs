for<00:00:30.919> somewhere<00:00:31.189> drier<00:00:31.550> and<00:00:31.910> bless<00:00:32.119> his<00:00:32.300> heart

better performance cattle

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:16.740 
better performance cattle
yep<00:02:15.110> we<00:02:15.410> run<00:02:15.620> cows

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:16.750 
yep we run cows

on the loose in telling about the ruse

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:38.400 
on the loose in telling about the ruse
soon<00:02:36.730> because<00:02:37.060> that's<00:02:37.240> a<00:02:37.360> major<00:02:37.720> part<00:02:38.170> of<00:02:38.350> your

cornerstone<00:02:41.709> of<00:02:41.740> our<00:02:42.360> transformation<00:02:43.360> here

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:43.720 
cornerstone of our transformation here

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:48.120 
cornerstone of our transformation here
in<00:02:44.910> nineteen<00:02:45.910> in<00:02:46.450> the<00:02:46.630> late<00:02:46.810> 1990s<00:02:47.620> this<00:02:47.830> place

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:48.130 
in nineteen in the late 1990s this place

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:50.540 
in nineteen in the late 1990s this place
was<00:02:48.459> tuning<00:02:48.880> into<00:02:49.000> a<00:02:49.090> basket-case<00:02:49.600> our

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:50.550 
was tuning into a basket-case our

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:53.010 
was tuning into a basket-case our
financial<00:02:51.550> performance<00:02:51.700> wasn't<00:02:52.390> good<00:02:52.989> enough

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:53.020 
financial performance wasn't good enough

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:56.310 
financial performance wasn't good enough
to<00:02:53.230> sustain<00:02:53.560> us<00:02:54.010> any<00:02:54.250> longer<00:02:54.610> and<00:02:54.930> I<00:02:55.930> heard

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:56.320 
to sustain us any longer and I heard

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:58.890 
to sustain us any longer and I heard
talk<00:02:57.190> from<00:02:57.340> dr.<00:02:57.640> Derek<00:02:57.910> moot<00:02:58.090> which<00:02:58.330> suggested

00:02:58.890 --> 00:02:58.900 
talk from dr. Derek moot which suggested

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:01.110 
talk from dr. Derek moot which suggested
that<00:02:58.959> if<00:02:59.230> we<00:02:59.500> tried<00:02:59.860> loosen<00:03:00.340> as<00:03:00.519> a<00:03:00.580> pasture

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:01.120 
that if we tried loosen as a pasture

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:03.509 
that if we tried loosen as a pasture
base<00:03:01.709> we<00:03:02.709> could<00:03:02.860> have<00:03:02.950> a<00:03:02.980> heck<00:03:03.190> of<00:03:03.310> a<00:03:03.430> lot

00:03:03.509 --> 00:03:03.519 
base we could have a heck of a lot

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:06.000 
base we could have a heck of a lot
better<00:03:03.580> journey<00:03:04.209> and<00:03:04.480> so<00:03:04.660> I<00:03:04.690> came<00:03:04.900> home<00:03:05.140> and<00:03:05.380> we

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.010 
better journey and so I came home and we

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:07.890 
better journey and so I came home and we
went<00:03:06.130> from<00:03:06.310> 50<00:03:06.700> hectares<00:03:07.060> of<00:03:07.239> loosened<00:03:07.630> up<00:03:07.720> to

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:07.900 
went from 50 hectares of loosened up to

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:09.000 
went from 50 hectares of loosened up to
about<00:03:08.170> three<00:03:08.380> hundred<00:03:08.410> and<00:03:08.709> forty-eight

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.010 
about three hundred and forty-eight

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:12.210 
about three hundred and forty-eight
years<00:03:09.160> today<00:03:09.610> and<00:03:10.500> that<00:03:11.500> has<00:03:11.650> been<00:03:11.830> the

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:12.220 
years today and that has been the

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:14.670 
years today and that has been the
catalyst<00:03:12.880> for<00:03:12.970> dramatic<00:03:13.780> change<00:03:14.050> in<00:03:14.260> our<00:03:14.440> and

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:14.680 
catalyst for dramatic change in our and

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:17.550 
catalyst for dramatic change in our and
our<00:03:14.769> luck<00:03:15.810> environmentally<00:03:16.810> socially<00:03:17.019> and

particularly economically you have a

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:23.280 
particularly economically you have a
vision<00:03:21.160> or<00:03:21.370> two<00:03:21.579> uh<00:03:21.820> yeah<00:03:22.720> hell<00:03:23.049> of<00:03:23.079> a<00:03:23.170> lot<00:03:23.200> of

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:23.290 
vision or two uh yeah hell of a lot of

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:26.220 
vision or two uh yeah hell of a lot of
visions<00:03:23.709> some<00:03:24.040> we<00:03:24.880> were<00:03:25.090> we<00:03:25.810> were<00:03:25.930> running

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:26.230 
visions some we were we were running

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:30.420 
visions some we were we were running
this<00:03:26.320> place<00:03:26.620> trying<00:03:27.250> to<00:03:27.370> bully<00:03:27.790> the<00:03:29.430> natural

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:30.430 
this place trying to bully the natural

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:32.880 
this place trying to bully the natural
forces<00:03:30.910> into<00:03:31.360> what<00:03:31.690> we<00:03:31.870> wanted<00:03:32.320> and<00:03:32.530> we<00:03:32.590> came

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:32.890 
forces into what we wanted and we came

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:36.449 
forces into what we wanted and we came
last<00:03:33.480> and<00:03:34.480> so<00:03:34.810> a<00:03:35.110> lot<00:03:35.320> of<00:03:35.410> the<00:03:35.590> process<00:03:36.280> here

00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:36.459 
last and so a lot of the process here

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:38.370 
last and so a lot of the process here
now<00:03:36.700> is<00:03:37.030> built<00:03:37.329> on<00:03:37.450> the<00:03:37.630> three<00:03:38.019> legs<00:03:38.230> of

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:38.380 
now is built on the three legs of

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:40.319 
now is built on the three legs of
sustainability<00:03:39.220> which<00:03:39.820> I've<00:03:39.970> just<00:03:40.000> mentioned

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:40.329 
sustainability which I've just mentioned

00:03:40.329 --> 00:03:43.800 
sustainability which I've just mentioned
environmental<00:03:40.840> social<00:03:41.470> and<00:03:41.709> economic<00:03:41.860> and<00:03:42.810> to

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:43.810 
environmental social and economic and to

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:45.420 
environmental social and economic and to
me<00:03:43.959> the<00:03:44.290> synchronicity<00:03:44.920> between<00:03:44.950> those

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:45.430 
me the synchronicity between those

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:48.270 
me the synchronicity between those
things<00:03:45.790> as<00:03:46.030> as<00:03:46.750> turn<00:03:47.470> the<00:03:47.650> power<00:03:47.860> switch<00:03:48.040> on

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:48.280 
things as as turn the power switch on

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:50.970 
things as as turn the power switch on
for<00:03:48.549> us<00:03:48.610> and<00:03:49.049> all<00:03:50.049> the<00:03:50.260> sky's<00:03:50.500> the<00:03:50.530> limit<00:03:50.680> I

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:50.980 
for us and all the sky's the limit I

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:53.100 
for us and all the sky's the limit I
think<00:03:51.010> until<00:03:51.820> you<00:03:51.880> working<00:03:52.360> with<00:03:52.390> nature

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:53.110 
think until you working with nature

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:57.090 
think until you working with nature
rather<00:03:53.470> than<00:03:53.829> against<00:03:54.190> absolutely<00:03:55.150> I<00:03:56.100> the

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:57.100 
rather than against absolutely I the

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:59.069 
rather than against absolutely I the
loosened<00:03:57.640> plant<00:03:57.910> is<00:03:58.120> a<00:03:58.150> deep<00:03:58.390> rooting<00:03:58.780> plant

00:03:59.069 --> 00:03:59.079 
loosened plant is a deep rooting plant

loosened plant is a deep rooting plant
it<00:03:59.680> means<00:03:59.980> that<00:04:00.190> we<00:04:00.280> can<00:04:00.430> start<00:04:00.700> to<00:04:00.850> take

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:01.030 
it means that we can start to take

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:05.130 
it means that we can start to take

whole process of retaining places like

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:10.980 
whole process of retaining places like
this<00:05:07.930> just<00:05:08.170> behind<00:05:08.410> us<00:05:08.680> and<00:05:08.920> also<00:05:09.930> planting<00:05:10.930> a

this just behind us and also planting a

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:12.870 
this just behind us and also planting a
whole<00:05:11.110> lot<00:05:11.290> more<00:05:11.470> and<00:05:11.860> it's<00:05:12.550> particularly

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:12.880 
whole lot more and it's particularly

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:15.390 
whole lot more and it's particularly

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:17.130 
satisfying part of the journey I hope
that<00:05:16.180> in<00:05:16.330> years<00:05:16.510> to<00:05:16.660> come<00:05:16.690> we'll<00:05:17.020> have<00:05:17.110> a

walking track through this farm and

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:21.180 
walking track through this farm and
we'll<00:05:19.300> be<00:05:19.450> able<00:05:19.510> to<00:05:19.660> earn<00:05:20.050> revenue<00:05:20.320> from<00:05:20.920> that

be fair I thought that there was a lack
of<00:06:05.470> vision<00:06:05.740> and<00:06:06.130> a<00:06:06.790> lack<00:06:06.970> of<00:06:07.000> rich<00:06:07.720> and<00:06:07.990> being
