00:00:02.379 --> 00:00:05.620
 ponchos so that we take the call 

00:00:04.029 --> 00:00:07.240
 struck out like these in we salute brand 

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:09.940
 Guerrero Cordova Díaz Juan Carlos Zúñiga 

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:12.950
 a few hours after you play this game 

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:14.990
 one way with the u.de.g before necaxa 

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:18.250
 hello how are they doing well 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:20.390
 waiting for nothing more than match 

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:23.370
 6 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:27.360
 have discussions but only being the 

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:29.610
 already the nerve the pnc is already 

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:32.900
 that generates you is in this type of 

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:35.280
 instances up to the present no longer just 

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:37.170
 what is missing for the match to 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.320
 start attacking all the adrenaline 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:42.210
 previous fact as a player you lived 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:45.989
 end with that team you'll leave it 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:49.210
 this rise coaching mx as 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:52.510
 you are living it as you perceive it 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:55.030
 I'm different every each end so much 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:57.670
 as a player as a coach are 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:59.360
 specials not really these instances 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:02.960
 tones that 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:09.290
 then marking in the race of 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:11.330
 we athletes and very different 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:16.220
 in the moments that are being recorded 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:17.930
 in your career and that's why I tell the 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:20.960
 boys and of course I do it 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:24.050
 that enjoy them are different weeks 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:25.300
 specials and we have to enjoy the 

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:28.480
 the rest 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:31.830
 struck out that you can unbalance in this 

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:31.830
 party in favor of the u of g 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:38.580
 I think we have an important factor 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:41.220
 in this moment that can favor us 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:44.550
 the inertia that brings the team the 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:48.030
 motivation that boys have the 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:49.770
 same public not all the factors I 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.420
 I think they can have a factor 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.190
 important for the game tonight 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.750
