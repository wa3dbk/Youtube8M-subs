 the score wins mud and for a good 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.300
 time has been working on a 

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:32.760
 mathematical formula that has allowed

 Holger did this practical exercise 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.660
 considering that one year has 365 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.730
 days 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:47.770
 and that by taking the time of a period 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:51.040
 of any agent in Colombia be 

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:54.820
 from the councilor, deputy mayor, governor 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:57.430
 or senator is 4 years because he decided 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:01:01.910
 that four years multiplied by 365 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:04.250
 days equals 1,460 days of government 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:06.500
 in sincelejo there is a sad culture 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:08.780

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.130
 false promises are a practice to the 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:12.950
 that the corrupt go massively 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:16.550
 to be benefited in the time of 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:18.110
 elections jorge made various tests and 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:20.060
 He made several experiments for 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:21.920
 decipher the value by which you buy 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:24.200

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:26.619

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.619
 pesos 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:31.690
 Jorge continued with his research 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:33.310

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:35.440
 the value of one vote per thousand 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:36.930
 four hundred sixty that is the amount 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:39.570
 in days of mandate in Colombia 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:43.720

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:45.040
 34.2 pesos but what does it mean in 34.2
