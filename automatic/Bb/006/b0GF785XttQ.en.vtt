00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
you slow down the mind and you lower

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.069 
you slow down the mind and you lower
those<00:02:04.770> brain<00:02:05.130> frequencies<00:02:05.490> and<00:02:06.060> after<00:02:07.049> a

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
those brain frequencies and after a

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:08.809 
those brain frequencies and after a
while<00:02:07.320> you<00:02:07.560> start<00:02:07.890> to<00:02:07.950> be<00:02:08.069> able<00:02:08.160> to<00:02:08.310> do<00:02:08.459> that<00:02:08.610> on

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
while you start to be able to do that on

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:11.610 
while you start to be able to do that on
demand<00:02:09.270> and<00:02:09.569> to<00:02:09.899> become<00:02:10.200> more<00:02:10.470> centered

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:11.620 
demand and to become more centered

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:16.110 
demand and to become more centered
and<00:02:11.709> a<00:02:12.310> more<00:02:13.590> brain<00:02:14.590> and<00:02:14.890> powered<00:02:15.370> individual

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
and a more brain and powered individual

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.780 
and a more brain and powered individual
so<00:02:16.629> that's<00:02:17.019> why<00:02:17.379> meditation<00:02:18.159> is<00:02:18.430> so<00:02:18.580> great

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
so that's why meditation is so great

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:19.949 
so that's why meditation is so great
that's<00:02:18.909> what<00:02:19.090> everyone<00:02:19.330> knows<00:02:19.540> they<00:02:19.780> should

00:02:19.949 --> 00:02:19.959 
that's what everyone knows they should

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:21.630 
that's what everyone knows they should
do<00:02:20.110> it<00:02:20.230> but<00:02:20.409> very<00:02:20.709> few<00:02:20.830> people<00:02:21.099> do<00:02:21.280> because

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:21.640 
do it but very few people do because

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:24.390 
do it but very few people do because
it's<00:02:21.790> very<00:02:22.330> time<00:02:22.540> consuming<00:02:22.569> and<00:02:23.200> requires<00:02:23.400> a

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 
it's very time consuming and requires a

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:29.759 
it's very time consuming and requires a
lot<00:02:25.120> of<00:02:25.590> willpower<00:02:26.590> really<00:02:27.510> so<00:02:28.510> the<00:02:28.989> brain<00:02:29.230> the

00:02:29.759 --> 00:02:29.769 
lot of willpower really so the brain the

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:32.160 
lot of willpower really so the brain the
brain<00:02:29.920> has<00:02:30.579> signatures<00:02:31.360> which<00:02:31.840> are<00:02:32.019> these

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.170 
brain has signatures which are these

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:34.080 
brain has signatures which are these
brainwaves<00:02:32.560> now<00:02:33.250> brainwaves<00:02:33.640> operate<00:02:33.970> in

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.090 
brainwaves now brainwaves operate in

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:35.699 
brainwaves now brainwaves operate in
frequencies<00:02:34.690> and<00:02:34.810> I'm<00:02:34.930> talking<00:02:35.349> in<00:02:35.500> a

00:02:35.699 --> 00:02:35.709 
frequencies and I'm talking in a

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:37.140 
frequencies and I'm talking in a
frequency<00:02:36.129> right<00:02:36.280> now<00:02:36.459> but<00:02:36.670> it's<00:02:36.760> pretty<00:02:36.879> high

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:37.150 
frequency right now but it's pretty high

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:40.369 
frequency right now but it's pretty high
frequency<00:02:37.750> and<00:02:37.959> the<00:02:38.650> brain<00:02:38.860> can't<00:02:39.129> hear

00:02:40.369 --> 00:02:40.379 
frequency and the brain can't hear

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:42.839 
frequency and the brain can't hear
frequencies<00:02:41.379> as<00:02:41.620> low<00:02:42.040> as<00:02:42.190> the<00:02:42.340> ones<00:02:42.549> it

00:02:42.839 --> 00:02:42.849 
frequencies as low as the ones it

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:45.210 
frequencies as low as the ones it
produces<00:02:43.480> well<00:02:43.599> the<00:02:43.690> ear<00:02:43.900> can't<00:02:44.560> understand

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:45.220 
produces well the ear can't understand

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:49.589 
produces well the ear can't understand
very<00:02:45.579> low<00:02:45.790> frequencies<00:02:46.599> so<00:02:47.470> how<00:02:48.459> does<00:02:49.000> the

00:02:49.589 --> 00:02:49.599 
very low frequencies so how does the

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:52.020 
very low frequencies so how does the
brain<00:02:49.810> evolution<00:02:50.019> system<00:02:50.680> actually<00:02:51.400> affect

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.030 
brain evolution system actually affect

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:56.729 
brain evolution system actually affect
your<00:02:52.510> brainwaves<00:02:53.170> very<00:02:54.040> odd<00:02:54.840> well<00:02:55.840> let's<00:02:56.440> chat

00:02:56.729 --> 00:02:56.739 
your brainwaves very odd well let's chat

00:02:56.739 --> 00:03:00.449 
your brainwaves very odd well let's chat
about<00:02:56.769> that<00:02:57.959> back<00:02:58.959> in<00:02:59.290> the<00:02:59.590> 1800's<00:03:00.400> a

00:03:00.449 --> 00:03:00.459 
about that back in the 1800's a

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:05.399 
about that back in the 1800's a
scientist<00:03:00.819> called<00:03:00.970> HW<00:03:01.739> discovered<00:03:03.000> that<00:03:04.409> when

00:03:05.399 --> 00:03:05.409 
scientist called HW discovered that when

00:03:05.409 --> 00:03:08.099 
scientist called HW discovered that when
you<00:03:05.709> insert<00:03:06.159> slightly<00:03:06.909> different<00:03:07.269> tones<00:03:07.510> into

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:08.109 
you insert slightly different tones into

00:03:08.109 --> 00:03:11.309 
you insert slightly different tones into
either<00:03:08.409> ear<00:03:08.980> for<00:03:09.940> example<00:03:10.329> imagine<00:03:10.959> that<00:03:11.230> you

00:03:11.309 --> 00:03:11.319 
either ear for example imagine that you

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:13.559 
either ear for example imagine that you
set<00:03:11.530> a<00:03:11.560> tone<00:03:11.829> of<00:03:11.890> 40<00:03:12.459> Hertz<00:03:12.609> into<00:03:13.299> the<00:03:13.390> right

00:03:13.559 --> 00:03:13.569 
set a tone of 40 Hertz into the right

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:17.069 
set a tone of 40 Hertz into the right
ear<00:03:13.870> and<00:03:14.669> forty<00:03:15.669> five<00:03:16.090> Hertz<00:03:16.389> into<00:03:16.780> the<00:03:16.870> left

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:17.079 
ear and forty five Hertz into the left

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:20.339 
ear and forty five Hertz into the left
ear<00:03:17.669> he<00:03:18.669> discovered<00:03:19.150> that<00:03:19.180> what<00:03:19.660> that<00:03:19.810> does<00:03:20.049> is

00:03:20.339 --> 00:03:20.349 
ear he discovered that what that does is

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:22.860 
ear he discovered that what that does is
it<00:03:20.440> actually<00:03:20.739> creates<00:03:21.099> a<00:03:21.519> third<00:03:21.970> binaural

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:22.870 
it actually creates a third binaural

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:26.039 
it actually creates a third binaural
beat<00:03:23.290> inside<00:03:24.099> the<00:03:24.310> mind<00:03:24.579> which<00:03:25.419> consists<00:03:26.019> of

00:03:26.039 --> 00:03:26.049 
beat inside the mind which consists of

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:27.960 
beat inside the mind which consists of
the<00:03:26.200> difference<00:03:26.620> in<00:03:26.889> frequencies<00:03:27.790> between

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:27.970 
the difference in frequencies between

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:30.000 
the difference in frequencies between
those<00:03:28.209> two<00:03:28.389> sounds<00:03:28.780> so<00:03:28.989> for<00:03:29.139> example<00:03:29.169> 40<00:03:29.799> here

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:30.010 
those two sounds so for example 40 here

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:32.819 
those two sounds so for example 40 here
45<00:03:30.519> here<00:03:30.849> that<00:03:31.329> actually<00:03:31.599> creates<00:03:31.690> 85<00:03:32.470> hurts

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:32.829 
45 here that actually creates 85 hurts

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:35.930 
45 here that actually creates 85 hurts
difference<00:03:33.400> inside<00:03:33.940> the<00:03:34.209> mind<00:03:34.500> now<00:03:35.500> what<00:03:35.739> that

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:35.940 
difference inside the mind now what that

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:38.759 
difference inside the mind now what that
does<00:03:36.940> what<00:03:37.180> happens<00:03:37.540> from<00:03:37.690> there<00:03:37.750> is<00:03:38.200> the

00:03:38.759 --> 00:03:38.769 
does what happens from there is the

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:40.589 
does what happens from there is the
brain<00:03:39.069> does<00:03:39.579> something<00:03:39.910> called<00:03:40.090> brainwave

00:03:40.589 --> 00:03:40.599 
brain does something called brainwave

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:42.839 
brain does something called brainwave
entrainment<00:03:41.129> which<00:03:42.129> means<00:03:42.459> that<00:03:42.579> it<00:03:42.730> actually

00:03:42.839 --> 00:03:42.849 
entrainment which means that it actually

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:45.390 
entrainment which means that it actually
follows<00:03:43.720> that<00:03:43.959> frequency<00:03:44.470> it<00:03:44.799> notices<00:03:45.280> that

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:45.400 
follows that frequency it notices that

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:47.400 
follows that frequency it notices that
our<00:03:45.519> frequency<00:03:46.000> is<00:03:46.060> occurring<00:03:46.540> inside<00:03:46.959> the

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:47.410 
our frequency is occurring inside the

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:49.379 
our frequency is occurring inside the
mind<00:03:47.650> and<00:03:47.949> it<00:03:48.579> follows<00:03:49.030> it<00:03:49.180> it<00:03:49.299> actually

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:49.389 
mind and it follows it it actually

00:03:49.389 --> 00:03:52.740 
mind and it follows it it actually
changes<00:03:49.629> the<00:03:50.290> brain<00:03:50.530> waves<00:03:51.180> inside<00:03:52.180> your

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:52.750 
changes the brain waves inside your

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:56.909 
changes the brain waves inside your
brain<00:03:53.169> to<00:03:53.889> match<00:03:54.400> that<00:03:54.430> frequency<00:03:55.859> as<00:03:56.859> a

00:03:56.909 --> 00:03:56.919 
brain to match that frequency as a

00:03:56.919 --> 00:04:00.990 
brain to match that frequency as a
result<00:03:57.549> your<00:03:58.540> mind<00:03:59.169> state<00:03:59.650> changes<00:04:00.340> in<00:04:00.579> other

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:01.000 
result your mind state changes in other

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.780 
result your mind state changes in other
words<00:04:01.299> as<00:04:01.480> your<00:04:01.720> brain<00:04:01.959> waves<00:04:02.199> lower<00:04:02.790> your

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:03.790 
words as your brain waves lower your

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:07.500 
words as your brain waves lower your
state<00:04:04.209> of<00:04:04.239> mind<00:04:04.500> alters<00:04:05.500> you<00:04:06.400> then<00:04:06.699> as<00:04:07.000> it<00:04:07.329> goes

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:07.510 
state of mind alters you then as it goes

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:09.839 
state of mind alters you then as it goes
down<00:04:08.169> you<00:04:08.470> become<00:04:08.769> more<00:04:08.889> relaxed<00:04:09.280> you<00:04:09.579> become

00:04:09.839 --> 00:04:09.849 
down you become more relaxed you become

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:12.360 
down you become more relaxed you become
more<00:04:10.030> focused<00:04:10.269> you<00:04:10.840> have<00:04:11.230> greater<00:04:11.650> access<00:04:11.859> to

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:12.370 
more focused you have greater access to

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:15.180 
more focused you have greater access to
these<00:04:13.060> peak<00:04:13.690> performance<00:04:14.260> states<00:04:14.470> of<00:04:14.680> mind<00:04:14.919> to

that<00:04:20.400> you<00:04:21.400> otherwise<00:04:21.669> would<00:04:22.060> not<00:04:22.090> have<00:04:22.360> access

00:04:22.529 --> 00:04:22.539 
that you otherwise would not have access

00:04:22.539 --> 00:04:23.970 
that you otherwise would not have access
to<00:04:22.960> without<00:04:23.229> many

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:23.980

years<00:04:24.160> of<00:04:24.220> meditative<00:04:24.820> training<00:04:25.330> so<00:04:26.020> that's

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:26.260 
years of meditative training so that's

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:28.650 
years of meditative training so that's
what<00:04:26.440> the<00:04:26.530> brain<00:04:26.710> evolution<00:04:26.890> system<00:04:27.460> does<00:04:27.820> not

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:28.660 
what the brain evolution system does not

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:31.230 
what the brain evolution system does not
just<00:04:29.380> using<00:04:29.650> that<00:04:29.800> one<00:04:30.220> simple<00:04:30.640> technique<00:04:31.030> of

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:31.240 
just using that one simple technique of

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:32.790 
just using that one simple technique of
a<00:04:31.540> slight<00:04:31.960> difference<00:04:32.380> that's<00:04:32.590> called

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:32.800 
a slight difference that's called

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:34.500 
a slight difference that's called
binaural<00:04:33.130> beats<00:04:33.430> but<00:04:33.880> it<00:04:34.000> uses<00:04:34.210> something

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:34.510 
binaural beats but it uses something

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:38.010 
binaural beats but it uses something
called<00:04:34.680> 3pd<00:04:35.680> EAP<00:04:36.330> three-point<00:04:37.330> dynamic<00:04:37.840> and

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:38.020 
called 3pd EAP three-point dynamic and

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:40.500 
called 3pd EAP three-point dynamic and
trainmen<00:04:38.410> audio<00:04:38.770> processing<00:04:39.280> which<00:04:39.790> enables

trainmen audio processing which enables

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:42.840 
trainmen audio processing which enables
it<00:04:40.840> to<00:04:40.870> not<00:04:41.860> just<00:04:42.010> use<00:04:42.160> that<00:04:42.190> technique<00:04:42.610> but<00:04:42.820> a

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:42.850 
it to not just use that technique but a

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:46.140 
it to not just use that technique but a
few<00:04:43.240> or<00:04:43.540> at<00:04:43.660> the<00:04:43.750> same<00:04:43.960> time<00:04:44.520> in<00:04:45.520> order<00:04:45.970> to

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:50.350 
waves to change your brain wave

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:52.110 
waves to change your brain wave
frequencies<00:04:50.380> to<00:04:51.040> enable<00:04:51.460> you<00:04:51.580> to<00:04:51.610> access

those peak performance states of mind on

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:57.960 
those peak performance states of mind on
demand<00:04:55.650> so<00:04:56.650> that's<00:04:56.860> generally<00:04:57.310> how<00:04:57.340> it<00:04:57.640> works

00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:57.970 
demand so that's generally how it works

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:01.280 
demand so that's generally how it works
now<00:04:58.300> each<00:04:58.450> of<00:04:58.600> these<00:04:58.720> CDs<00:04:59.230> contains<00:04:59.980> a

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:01.290 
now each of these CDs contains a

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:04.440 
now each of these CDs contains a
30-minute<00:05:02.290> program<00:05:02.860> which<00:05:03.610> when<00:05:03.970> you<00:05:04.090> listen

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:04.450 
30-minute program which when you listen

30-minute program which when you listen
to<00:05:04.600> it<00:05:04.630> will<00:05:05.170> take<00:05:05.350> you<00:05:05.470> down<00:05:05.650> to<00:05:05.680> a<00:05:05.860> certain

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:06.310 
to it will take you down to a certain

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:08.190 
to it will take you down to a certain
level<00:05:06.460> and<00:05:06.820> then<00:05:07.330> ultimately<00:05:07.480> bring<00:05:07.960> you<00:05:08.050> back

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:08.200 
level and then ultimately bring you back

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:12.360 
level and then ultimately bring you back
up<00:05:08.350> again<00:05:08.620> and<00:05:10.260> there<00:05:11.260> are<00:05:11.350> six<00:05:11.560> cds<00:05:11.890> and<00:05:12.190> it's

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:12.370 
up again and there are six cds and it's

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:15.390 
up again and there are six cds and it's
a<00:05:12.460> six-month<00:05:13.000> program<00:05:13.300> to<00:05:14.110> slowly<00:05:14.770> take<00:05:15.160> you

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:15.400 
a six-month program to slowly take you

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:17.370 
a six-month program to slowly take you
further<00:05:15.970> and<00:05:16.270> further<00:05:16.420> deeper<00:05:17.140> and<00:05:17.230> deeper

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:17.380 
further and further deeper and deeper

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:19.860 
further and further deeper and deeper
deeper<00:05:18.070> and<00:05:18.340> deeper<00:05:18.460> lower<00:05:19.150> and<00:05:19.390> lower<00:05:19.540> so

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:19.870 
deeper and deeper lower and lower so

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:21.870 
deeper and deeper lower and lower so
that<00:05:19.960> you<00:05:20.050> can<00:05:20.260> build<00:05:21.040> your<00:05:21.310> brain<00:05:21.550> just<00:05:21.580> like

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:21.880 
that you can build your brain just like

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:24.600 
that you can build your brain just like
you<00:05:22.000> build<00:05:22.180> any<00:05:22.390> muscle<00:05:22.900> in<00:05:23.080> your<00:05:23.110> body<00:05:23.610> so

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:24.610 
you build any muscle in your body so

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:27.150 
you build any muscle in your body so
that<00:05:24.840> it<00:05:25.840> becomes<00:05:25.990> more<00:05:26.350> powerful<00:05:26.590> it<00:05:27.070> becomes

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:27.160 
that it becomes more powerful it becomes

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:29.100 
that it becomes more powerful it becomes
stronger<00:05:27.640> so<00:05:27.970> that<00:05:28.000> you're<00:05:28.240> then<00:05:28.450> able<00:05:28.750> to

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:29.110 
stronger so that you're then able to

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:31.860 
stronger so that you're then able to
access<00:05:29.500> those<00:05:29.800> those<00:05:30.400> deeper<00:05:31.060> frequencies

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:31.870 
access those those deeper frequencies

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:34.100 
access those those deeper frequencies
those<00:05:32.140> lower<00:05:32.410> frequencies<00:05:32.980> those<00:05:33.220> more

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:34.110 
those lower frequencies those more

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:38.100 
those lower frequencies those more
inspired<00:05:35.110> states<00:05:35.590> of<00:05:35.830> mind<00:05:36.190> on<00:05:36.630> demand<00:05:37.630> so<00:05:38.050> you

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:38.110 
inspired states of mind on demand so you

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:40.350 
inspired states of mind on demand so you
can<00:05:38.470> boost<00:05:38.710> your<00:05:38.920> IQ<00:05:39.160> so<00:05:39.610> you<00:05:39.700> can<00:05:39.820> rocket<00:05:40.120> your

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:40.360 
can boost your IQ so you can rocket your

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:41.640 
can boost your IQ so you can rocket your
brain<00:05:40.540> power<00:05:40.840> so<00:05:41.050> you<00:05:41.080> can<00:05:41.170> double<00:05:41.620> your

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:41.650 
brain power so you can double your

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:43.950 
brain power so you can double your
ability<00:05:42.100> to<00:05:42.220> learn<00:05:42.370> so<00:05:43.180> that<00:05:43.360> you<00:05:43.450> can<00:05:43.630> improve

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:43.960 
ability to learn so that you can improve

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:45.600 
ability to learn so that you can improve
your<00:05:44.020> relationships<00:05:44.740> your<00:05:44.860> communication

your creativity your memory it truly
enables<00:05:49.780> you<00:05:49.990> to<00:05:50.020> build<00:05:50.200> your<00:05:50.770> brain<00:05:51.070> like<00:05:51.490> a

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:51.640 
enables you to build your brain like a

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:54.900 
enables you to build your brain like a
muscle<00:05:52.470> so<00:05:53.470> that's<00:05:53.800> what<00:05:54.520> the<00:05:54.640> brain

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:54.910 
muscle so that's what the brain

00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:57.150 
muscle so that's what the brain
evolution<00:05:55.240> system<00:05:55.840> does<00:05:56.080> and<00:05:56.320> generally<00:05:56.770> that

00:05:57.150 --> 00:05:57.160 
evolution system does and generally that

00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:01.470 
evolution system does and generally that
is<00:05:57.400> how<00:05:57.640> it<00:05:57.670> works<00:05:58.090> a<00:05:58.800> six-cd<00:06:00.480> brainwave

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:01.480 
is how it works a six-cd brainwave
