it<00:00:30.269> I'm<00:00:31.109> going<00:00:31.800> to<00:00:31.890> change<00:00:32.099> the<00:00:32.279> loop<00:00:32.489> and

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
it I'm going to change the loop and

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:42.229 
it I'm going to change the loop and
speed<00:00:36.710> that<00:00:37.710> should<00:00:37.950> be<00:00:40.969> that<00:00:41.969> looks<00:00:42.120> about

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
speed that should be that looks about

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.069 
speed that should be that looks about
right<00:00:42.390> you<00:00:43.290> could<00:00:43.440> also<00:00:43.649> change<00:00:43.980> the<00:00:44.129> speed<00:00:45.079> to

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
right you could also change the speed to

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.819 
right you could also change the speed to
slow<00:00:46.440> and<00:00:46.739> very<00:00:47.309> slow<00:00:48.149> I<00:00:48.420> personally<00:00:49.379> like<00:00:49.590> the
