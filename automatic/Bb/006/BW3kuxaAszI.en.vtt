00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
them play they're competing and playing

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:55.850 
them play they're competing and playing
hard<00:01:54.660> but<00:01:54.780> they're<00:01:54.960> making<00:01:55.110> mistakes<00:01:55.619> that

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
hard but they're making mistakes that

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.820 
hard but they're making mistakes that
young<00:01:56.040> players<00:01:56.340> make<00:01:56.700> and<00:01:57.470> just<00:01:58.470> takes<00:01:58.680> some

00:01:58.820 --> 00:01:58.830 
young players make and just takes some

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:01.070 
young players make and just takes some
time<00:01:59.040> there's<00:01:59.400> just<00:01:59.580> not<00:01:59.729> any<00:01:59.790> way<00:02:00.210> to<00:02:00.270> correct

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:01.080 
time there's just not any way to correct

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:04.760 
time there's just not any way to correct
it<00:02:01.320> in<00:02:01.820> in<00:02:02.820> a<00:02:03.119> speedy<00:02:03.570> fashion<00:02:04.080> takes<00:02:04.470> just<00:02:04.710> a

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
it in in a speedy fashion takes just a

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.740 
it in in a speedy fashion takes just a
little<00:02:04.979> bit<00:02:05.070> of<00:02:05.130> time<00:02:05.340> but<00:02:05.580> they're<00:02:06.509> learning

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
little bit of time but they're learning

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.290 
little bit of time but they're learning
their<00:02:07.080> improved<00:02:07.880> you<00:02:08.880> know<00:02:08.970> when<00:02:09.090> you<00:02:09.179> look

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
their improved you know when you look

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.479 
their improved you know when you look
out<00:02:09.479> there<00:02:09.630> at<00:02:09.750> times<00:02:10.020> I<00:02:10.470> think<00:02:10.860> I<00:02:11.160> counted

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
out there at times I think I counted

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:13.100 
out there at times I think I counted
today<00:02:11.610> eight<00:02:12.000> freshmen<00:02:12.300> on<00:02:12.570> the<00:02:12.660> field<00:02:12.870> at<00:02:12.959> one

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
today eight freshmen on the field at one

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:16.160 
today eight freshmen on the field at one
time<00:02:13.320> and<00:02:13.709> so<00:02:14.489> you<00:02:15.239> know<00:02:15.360> it's<00:02:15.720> a<00:02:15.810> good<00:02:15.959> thing

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
time and so you know it's a good thing

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:17.540 
time and so you know it's a good thing
and<00:02:16.410> then<00:02:16.530> you<00:02:16.620> also<00:02:16.739> hold<00:02:17.070> your<00:02:17.190> breath<00:02:17.370> at

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550 
and then you also hold your breath at

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:20.210 
and then you also hold your breath at
the<00:02:17.610> same<00:02:17.760> time<00:02:18.470> he<00:02:19.470> said<00:02:19.680> that<00:02:19.860> the

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
the same time he said that the

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:21.860 
the same time he said that the
quarterbacks<00:02:20.790> played<00:02:21.090> as<00:02:21.239> well<00:02:21.269> as<00:02:21.450> they<00:02:21.600> had

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
quarterbacks played as well as they had

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:22.940 
quarterbacks played as well as they had
in<00:02:21.900> a<00:02:22.050> couple<00:02:22.290> of<00:02:22.350> years<00:02:22.410> in<00:02:22.680> terms<00:02:22.800> of

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
in a couple of years in terms of

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.070 
in a couple of years in terms of
scrimmage<00:02:23.370> situation<00:02:23.940> what<00:02:24.390> did<00:02:24.510> garment<00:02:25.019> in

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
scrimmage situation what did garment in

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:26.479 
scrimmage situation what did garment in
particular<00:02:25.350> should<00:02:25.800> you<00:02:25.980> consider<00:02:26.250> the<00:02:26.430> fact

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:26.489 
particular should you consider the fact

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:29.270 
particular should you consider the fact
that<00:02:26.700> he's<00:02:27.110> he<00:02:28.110> played<00:02:28.320> very<00:02:28.530> well<00:02:28.680> you<00:02:29.130> threw

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
that he's he played very well you threw

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.130 
that he's he played very well you threw
the<00:02:29.400> ball<00:02:29.519> effectively<00:02:29.670> he<00:02:30.510> was<00:02:30.690> able<00:02:30.810> to<00:02:31.019> move

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
the ball effectively he was able to move

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:32.720 
the ball effectively he was able to move
around<00:02:31.320> the<00:02:31.500> pocket<00:02:31.950> and<00:02:32.070> pick<00:02:32.250> up<00:02:32.400> some<00:02:32.580> yards

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
around the pocket and pick up some yards

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:36.080 
around the pocket and pick up some yards
on<00:02:32.970> a<00:02:33.000> scrambler<00:02:33.510> a<00:02:33.690> couple<00:02:34.290> times<00:02:34.910> but<00:02:35.910> as<00:02:36.060> a

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
on a scrambler a couple times but as a

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:38.960 
on a scrambler a couple times but as a
group<00:02:36.450> the<00:02:37.140> three<00:02:37.650> of<00:02:37.680> them<00:02:37.920> had<00:02:38.610> is<00:02:38.730> probably

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
group the three of them had is probably

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:40.220 
group the three of them had is probably
as<00:02:39.090> good<00:02:39.180> as<00:02:39.330> scrimmages<00:02:39.780> we've<00:02:39.930> had<00:02:40.080> at<00:02:40.200> the

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
as good as scrimmages we've had at the

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:42.830 
as good as scrimmages we've had at the
quarterback<00:02:40.560> position<00:02:40.680> in<00:02:41.280> number<00:02:41.730> of<00:02:41.790> years

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
quarterback position in number of years

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.360 
quarterback position in number of years
is<00:02:42.989> that<00:02:43.200> more<00:02:43.379> testament<00:02:43.890> of<00:02:43.920> how<00:02:43.980> well<00:02:44.220> they

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
is that more testament of how well they

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:45.920 
is that more testament of how well they
played<00:02:44.670> or<00:02:44.879> is<00:02:45.030> that<00:02:45.150> the<00:02:45.209> young<00:02:45.420> defense<00:02:45.780> may

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
played or is that the young defense may

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:47.330 
played or is that the young defense may
be<00:02:45.989> struggling<00:02:46.319> or<00:02:46.590> mixture<00:02:46.860> of<00:02:46.950> both<00:02:47.069> how

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
be struggling or mixture of both how

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:49.580 
be struggling or mixture of both how
could<00:02:47.489> be<00:02:47.610> a<00:02:47.640> combination<00:02:47.940> of<00:02:48.239> both<00:02:48.590> they're

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
could be a combination of both they're

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:50.900 
could be a combination of both they're
all<00:02:49.709> they're<00:02:50.040> obviously<00:02:50.519> a<00:02:50.610> little<00:02:50.670> more

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:50.910 
all they're obviously a little more

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:52.600 
all they're obviously a little more
vulnerable<00:02:51.360> and<00:02:51.540> there's<00:02:51.660> youth<00:02:51.870> out<00:02:52.050> there

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:52.610 
vulnerable and there's youth out there

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:55.670 
vulnerable and there's youth out there
but<00:02:53.610> I<00:02:53.819> have<00:02:54.090> a<00:02:54.150> pretty<00:02:54.330> good<00:02:54.510> feel<00:02:54.720> for<00:02:54.989> when

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
but I have a pretty good feel for when

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:57.559 
but I have a pretty good feel for when
the<00:02:55.769> quarterback<00:02:56.190> is<00:02:56.220> in<00:02:57.000> the<00:02:57.090> right<00:02:57.239> spot

00:02:57.559 --> 00:02:57.569 
the quarterback is in the right spot

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:00.050 
the quarterback is in the right spot
mentally<00:02:58.019> and<00:02:58.170> physically<00:02:58.950> obviously<00:02:59.250> with

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
mentally and physically obviously with

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:01.610 
mentally and physically obviously with
when<00:03:00.420> he<00:03:00.480> has<00:03:00.599> to<00:03:00.720> run<00:03:00.870> the<00:03:00.989> football<00:03:01.140> and<00:03:01.500> so<00:03:01.590> I

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
when he has to run the football and so I

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:03.199 
when he has to run the football and so I
thought<00:03:01.830> that<00:03:01.890> they<00:03:02.129> competed<00:03:02.640> and<00:03:02.730> made<00:03:03.180> a

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:03.209 
thought that they competed and made a

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:06.020 
thought that they competed and made a
good<00:03:03.480> place<00:03:03.750> today<00:03:04.670> every<00:03:05.670> year<00:03:05.700> there's<00:03:05.970> a

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
good place today every year there's a

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:08.270 
good place today every year there's a
new<00:03:06.120> team<00:03:07.049> to<00:03:07.260> feel<00:03:07.470> at<00:03:07.650> camping<00:03:07.950> with<00:03:08.040> camp

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 
new team to feel at camping with camp

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:09.650 
new team to feel at camping with camp

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:17.489 
need to improve on but we're certainly

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:20.960 
need to improve on but we're certainly
as<00:04:17.790> far<00:04:18.060> along<00:04:18.180> as<00:04:18.329> we<00:04:18.600> can<00:04:18.780> be<00:04:18.959> right<00:04:19.200> now<00:04:19.970> with

as far along as we can be right now with

as far along as we can be right now with
the<00:04:21.150> veteran<00:04:21.480> players<00:04:21.720> and<00:04:22.079> then<00:04:22.380> you<00:04:22.740> have

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:22.860 
the veteran players and then you have

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:24.680 
the veteran players and then you have
another<00:04:22.890> category<00:04:23.400> of<00:04:23.610> young<00:04:23.820> players<00:04:23.970> and<00:04:24.600> I

think we're as far along as they can be
at<00:04:27.060> this<00:04:27.270> stage<00:04:27.480> in<00:04:27.630> our<00:04:27.720> career<00:04:28.050> with<00:04:28.650> these
