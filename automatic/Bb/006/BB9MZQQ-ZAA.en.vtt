hi i'm dr. greg ellis and today i want

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:06.740 
hi i'm dr. greg ellis and today i want
to<00:00:04.049> talk<00:00:04.200> about<00:00:04.259> lit<00:00:04.680> though<00:00:04.859> genesis<00:00:05.520> and<00:00:05.759> as

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:06.750 
to talk about lit though genesis and as

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.419 
to talk about lit though genesis and as
the<00:00:06.919> manufacturer<00:00:07.919> of<00:00:08.690> fat<00:00:09.690> from<00:00:10.019> non<00:00:10.950> fat

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
the manufacturer of fat from non fat

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:15.829 
the manufacturer of fat from non fat
sources<00:00:12.860> the<00:00:13.860> primary<00:00:14.190> source<00:00:14.759> were<00:00:15.059> making

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
sources the primary source were making

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:19.970 
sources the primary source were making
fat<00:00:16.529> is<00:00:18.109> glucose<00:00:19.109> or<00:00:19.350> blood<00:00:19.410> sugar

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
fat is glucose or blood sugar

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.519 
fat is glucose or blood sugar
carbohydrates<00:00:20.970> so<00:00:21.539> carbohydrates<00:00:22.320> are

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
carbohydrates so carbohydrates are

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:26.480 
carbohydrates so carbohydrates are
converted<00:00:23.010> into<00:00:23.160> body<00:00:23.939> fat<00:00:24.240> and<00:00:24.949> this<00:00:25.949> process

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
converted into body fat and this process

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.800 
converted into body fat and this process
occurs<00:00:26.789> fairly<00:00:27.720> rapidly<00:00:28.410> and<00:00:28.740> very<00:00:29.189> strongly

occurs fairly rapidly and very strongly

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:33.020 
occurs fairly rapidly and very strongly
there<00:00:30.810> is<00:00:31.080> conflicting<00:00:31.470> evidence<00:00:31.920> about<00:00:32.820> it

and make some comments asking me about

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:03.439 
and make some comments asking me about
de<00:00:59.879> novo<00:01:00.420> lipogenesis<00:01:00.739> that<00:01:01.739> was<00:01:02.039> called<00:01:02.449> de

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:12.770 
that this does not happen in humans so i

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:16.940 
that this does not happen in humans so i
asked<00:01:13.770> them<00:01:14.220> to<00:01:14.790> go<00:01:15.240> get<00:01:15.450> this<00:01:15.600> paper<00:01:15.900> from<00:01:16.380> dr.

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
asked them to go get this paper from dr.

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.490 
asked them to go get this paper from dr.
wolf<00:01:17.159> and<00:01:17.430> read<00:01:18.360> it<00:01:18.540> and<00:01:18.720> come<00:01:18.960> back<00:01:18.990> make<00:01:19.470> a

me personally and make the comments
about<00:01:25.320> how<00:01:26.009> i<00:01:26.040> don't<00:01:26.159> know<00:01:26.369> anything<00:01:27.259> i've

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
about how i don't know anything i've

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.050 
about how i don't know anything i've
been<00:01:28.409> studying<00:01:28.619> the<00:01:28.890> PO<00:01:29.009> genesis<00:01:29.460> for<00:01:29.729> 30

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
been studying the PO genesis for 30

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.929 
been studying the PO genesis for 30
years<00:01:30.329> i<00:01:31.189> think<00:01:32.189> i<00:01:32.280> do<00:01:32.340> know<00:01:32.549> something<00:01:32.790> about

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
years i think i do know something about

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:37.370 
years i think i do know something about
it<00:01:33.619> and<00:01:35.210> because<00:01:36.210> of<00:01:36.329> my<00:01:36.450> stance<00:01:36.810> on<00:01:37.110> the

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
it and because of my stance on the

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.580 
it and because of my stance on the
hazards<00:01:37.829> of<00:01:37.920> carbohydrates<00:01:38.700> and<00:01:39.110> the<00:01:40.110> glucose

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
hazards of carbohydrates and the glucose

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.560 
hazards of carbohydrates and the glucose
they<00:01:40.860> yield<00:01:41.189> and<00:01:41.549> that<00:01:41.700> glucose<00:01:42.119> get<00:01:42.299> diverted

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
they yield and that glucose get diverted

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:47.060 
they yield and that glucose get diverted
to<00:01:42.780> body<00:01:42.960> fat<00:01:44.030> this<00:01:45.030> really<00:01:45.600> has<00:01:46.470> made<00:01:46.860> some

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
to body fat this really has made some

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.700 
to body fat this really has made some
interest<00:01:47.460> for<00:01:47.729> me<00:01:47.840> now<00:01:48.840> one<00:01:49.140> of<00:01:49.170> the<00:01:49.320> basic

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
interest for me now one of the basic

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.609 
interest for me now one of the basic
theories<00:01:50.340> that<00:01:51.090> i<00:01:51.509> really<00:01:52.290> enjoy<00:01:52.590> about

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
theories that i really enjoy about

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:56.359 
theories that i really enjoy about
controlling<00:01:53.430> food<00:01:53.909> intake<00:01:54.659> is<00:01:54.930> the<00:01:55.710> concept

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
controlling food intake is the concept

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:59.929 
controlling food intake is the concept
of<00:01:56.579> fuel<00:01:57.149> partitioning<00:01:58.020> and<00:01:58.399> that<00:01:59.399> is<00:01:59.670> the

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
of fuel partitioning and that is the

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:03.770 
of fuel partitioning and that is the
idea<00:02:00.060> that<00:02:01.040> food<00:02:02.040> can<00:02:02.369> either<00:02:02.579> be<00:02:02.729> stored<00:02:03.090> or

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
idea that food can either be stored or

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.760 
idea that food can either be stored or
it<00:02:04.259> can<00:02:04.380> be<00:02:04.409> burned<00:02:05.600> now<00:02:06.600> carbohydrate<00:02:07.409> sets

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
it can be burned now carbohydrate sets

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.889 
it can be burned now carbohydrate sets
up<00:02:07.950> at<00:02:08.160> a<00:02:08.190> nutritional<00:02:08.819> and<00:02:08.910> hormonal<00:02:09.270> profile

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
up at a nutritional and hormonal profile

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:13.630 
up at a nutritional and hormonal profile
that<00:02:10.170> forces<00:02:10.940> food<00:02:11.940> to<00:02:12.480> be<00:02:12.599> stored

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640 
that forces food to be stored

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:17.270 
that forces food to be stored
primarily<00:02:14.640> as<00:02:14.790> body<00:02:15.000> fat<00:02:15.470> and<00:02:16.470> it<00:02:16.860> shuts<00:02:17.130> down

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
primarily as body fat and it shuts down

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.690 
primarily as body fat and it shuts down
the<00:02:17.430> pathways<00:02:17.910> of<00:02:17.940> burning<00:02:18.510> and<00:02:19.489> then<00:02:20.489> it

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
the pathways of burning and then it

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.790 
the pathways of burning and then it
turns<00:02:20.940> out<00:02:21.180> that<00:02:21.450> that<00:02:21.630> fuel<00:02:22.260> is<00:02:22.410> no<00:02:22.560> longer

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 
turns out that that fuel is no longer

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:26.330 
turns out that that fuel is no longer
available<00:02:23.160> and<00:02:24.349> people<00:02:25.349> actually<00:02:25.709> over<00:02:26.160> eight

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
available and people actually over eight

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:27.290 
available and people actually over eight
so<00:02:26.760> if<00:02:26.819> you<00:02:26.910> want<00:02:27.030> to<00:02:27.090> know<00:02:27.180> what<00:02:27.270> the

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300 
so if you want to know what the

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:30.020 
so if you want to know what the
overeating<00:02:27.900> epidemics<00:02:28.770> coming<00:02:29.160> from<00:02:29.370> it's

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
overeating epidemics coming from it's

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:31.970 
overeating epidemics coming from it's
because<00:02:30.480> food<00:02:30.810> is<00:02:30.840> being<00:02:31.170> partitioned<00:02:31.650> into

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
because food is being partitioned into

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:36.759 
because food is being partitioned into
storage<00:02:32.400> and<00:02:32.750> as<00:02:33.750> body<00:02:34.110> fat<00:02:34.200> levels<00:02:34.830> increase

00:02:36.759 --> 00:02:36.769 
storage and as body fat levels increase

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:40.850 
storage and as body fat levels increase
food<00:02:37.769> intake<00:02:38.250> also<00:02:38.730> increases<00:02:39.500> getting<00:02:40.500> fat

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
food intake also increases getting fat
