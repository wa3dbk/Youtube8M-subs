00:00:08.829 --> 00:00:13.080
 today we want to do is a demonstration of how a church design works 

00:00:13.589 --> 00:00:15.300
 the weak ones to perform 

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:17.359
 some delinquent neighbors 

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:19.880
 those that include panels 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:21.810
 each one Spanish after 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.490
 I want to learn gates the two also huge amounts of money 

00:00:27.929 --> 00:00:31.389
 take much more advantage of these disciplines because you can get 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.650
 three different sizes of August although you see that all three are exactly 

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:38.150
 same 

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:41.070
 then the materials that they need and are 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.070
 the office 

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:46.610
 your 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:48.780
 and a piece of cloth 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.530
 besides that the us 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:55.560
 césar conde de lemos the instructions in Spanish of investigations 

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:57.260
 special for 3d 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.760
 how does it work 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.540
 The first thing we will do in 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:04.090
 one of the things 

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:07.090
 I was lucky is to cut the office 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:10.600
 by ap liquidity 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.920
 what we have done has been to cut the child's office 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:35.920
 why 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:39.360
 to see how it was said as well as who do you think 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:44.260
 this way different to carry out this course this aggrieved sense 

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:48.200
 next to this fact a thicker size 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:51.570
 a big 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.570
 in this way take advantage of that maximum fiselina 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.490
 we have to be shorter 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:01.490
 What we deserve is violence 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:07.340
 you can buy yen sides one side for the common good chajá car and a new 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:10.189
 game system knowing that it contains 

00:02:10.189 --> 00:02:12.319
 the most aggressive part 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:14.449
 touches on this side 

00:02:14.449 --> 00:02:16.859
 we will place 

00:02:16.859 --> 00:02:21.119
 one of the ones that has to win out gets size 

00:02:21.119 --> 00:02:24.139
 of being found 

00:02:24.139 --> 00:02:27.139
 on stage that surprises us with the bench press sip 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:31.709
 the president of the council 2 

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:39.479
 we have already adhered 

00:02:39.479 --> 00:02:42.739
 the fabric to each of the disciplines 

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:43.819
 Consult 

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:45.969
 ambient 

00:02:45.969 --> 00:02:48.529
 smaller 

00:02:48.529 --> 00:02:51.339
 and then now what we want to do is 

00:02:51.339 --> 00:02:55.199
 cut it is time that the office and up here therefore we must go through here 

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:05.589
 once all households have been cut 

00:03:05.589 --> 00:03:08.589
 we are left in this area 

00:03:15.429 --> 00:03:17.999
 the office marked us 

00:03:17.999 --> 00:03:19.090
 peris 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:21.849
 horizontal lines 

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:24.849
 and we want to do this the controversy 

00:03:26.499 --> 00:03:29.649
 we will double hurry half 

00:03:29.649 --> 00:03:32.649
 the central 

00:03:34.309 --> 00:03:37.309
 we will double lender 

00:03:37.949 --> 00:03:40.239
 we will place it 

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:43.239
 I had no other 

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:49.299
 i this other horizontal line 

00:03:50.029 --> 00:03:52.789
 the juventus also 

00:03:52.789 --> 00:03:55.789
 with the desire that we have achieved 

00:03:56.519 --> 00:03:58.679
 we have the three lines 

00:03:58.679 --> 00:04:01.679
 that are totally 

00:04:13.589 --> 00:04:16.049
 now basically what we will do will be 

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:17.349
 a thread 

00:04:17.349 --> 00:04:20.539
 eat in oblivion with the laws 

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:24.479
 that is, we have become accustomed through the continuous line 

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:25.290
 here 

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:27.499
 the trustee that they leave us 

00:04:27.499 --> 00:04:30.649
 this open space and here not be sew 

00:04:31.669 --> 00:04:34.169
 in this case the free drawing 

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:37.860
 logically we want to take advantage of all the hobby starvation or 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:40.879
 in your profile then the posture we will perform 

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:43.009
 guayaquil 

00:04:43.009 --> 00:04:46.120
 here 

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:49.460
 we will be a nation of Argentina the man next door 

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:51.800
 of mercy 

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:55.069
 As you can see this is the drawing you need 

00:04:55.069 --> 00:04:58.669
 weekend but we have analyzed the position here 

00:04:58.669 --> 00:04:59.949
 here 

00:04:59.949 --> 00:05:03.309
 here for the union sector and here 

00:05:03.309 --> 00:05:06.309
 we grow back 

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:09.909
 are all your lines 

00:05:09.909 --> 00:05:11.129
 is 

00:05:11.129 --> 00:05:14.129
 that demands Syria or exact 

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:16.860
 since I was younger 

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:21.250
 we have taken advantage of all those that have to go to 40 more points 

00:05:22.129 --> 00:05:25.129
 now angels this tessitura 

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:28.610
 we open 

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:30.539
 We try 

00:05:30.539 --> 00:05:33.849
 let's find out 

00:05:33.849 --> 00:05:34.800
 all 

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:37.800
 the ops 

00:05:40.969 --> 00:05:42.889
 nor sky introducing 

00:05:42.889 --> 00:05:44.930
 slowly 

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:47.930
 not be 

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:53.909
 we have not played well 

00:05:53.909 --> 00:05:56.909
 two 

00:06:05.509 --> 00:06:07.580
 i the sentence 

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:10.520
 that way this is also the smallest 

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:12.919
 mayer candela we have 

00:06:12.919 --> 00:06:15.919
 the three things 

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:20.710
 the inside of the court 

00:06:22.069 --> 00:06:26.139
 we look closely at the positions they have inwards to be able to close 

00:06:26.139 --> 00:06:28.759
 defending 

00:06:28.759 --> 00:06:35.389
 also the three measures of things ap we have done that age inn 

00:06:35.389 --> 00:06:38.389
 later 

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:41.990
 two pockets 

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:46.949
 another smaller the small movidil present 

00:06:47.979 --> 00:06:50.180
 tickets 

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:53.149
 we'll see 

00:06:53.149 --> 00:06:56.309
 those are the three preventive measures example 

00:06:56.309 --> 00:06:59.309
 that's why we're going to finish you can do it 

00:07:00.639 --> 00:07:03.639
 place the engine 

00:07:04.869 --> 00:07:06.479
 and here we have 3 

00:07:06.479 --> 00:07:09.779
 other voices that have been made by the different themes 

00:07:09.779 --> 00:07:12.580
 that we have in our web 

00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:14.710
 www change org 

00:07:14.710 --> 00:07:18.129
 dot com 

00:07:18.129 --> 00:07:20.499
 we hope it is followed when entering 

00:07:20.499 --> 00:07:23.219
 it was already difficult these three things 

00:07:23.219 --> 00:07:25.479
 Hilden always went ahead thank you very much
