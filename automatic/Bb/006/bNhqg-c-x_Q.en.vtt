the<00:01:57.119> hook<00:01:57.240> shank<00:01:57.479> is<00:01:57.719> that's<00:01:57.960> important<00:01:58.469> now

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
the hook shank is that's important now

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:01.940 
the hook shank is that's important now
he<00:01:59.100> evens<00:01:59.460> up<00:01:59.640> both<00:01:59.820> feathers<00:02:00.270> and<00:02:00.509> then<00:02:01.439> takes

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
he evens up both feathers and then takes

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.219 
he evens up both feathers and then takes
a<00:02:02.340> few<00:02:02.729> of<00:02:02.850> the<00:02:02.939> fibers<00:02:03.659> and<00:02:03.869> makes<00:02:04.020> a<00:02:04.110> little

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
a few of the fibers and makes a little

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:06.709 
a few of the fibers and makes a little
handle<00:02:04.649> on<00:02:04.740> them<00:02:04.860> and<00:02:05.009> he<00:02:05.399> twists<00:02:06.000> that<00:02:06.119> just<00:02:06.570> a

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
handle on them and he twists that just a

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:08.990 
handle on them and he twists that just a
little<00:02:07.140> bit<00:02:07.350> to<00:02:07.829> help<00:02:08.009> it<00:02:08.220> wine<00:02:08.429> nice<00:02:08.729> and

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
little bit to help it wine nice and

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.910 
little bit to help it wine nice and
smooth<00:02:09.239> you<00:02:09.270> do<00:02:09.599> have<00:02:09.810> to<00:02:09.929> straighten<00:02:10.649> it<00:02:10.860> out

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
smooth you do have to straighten it out

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.210 
smooth you do have to straighten it out
a<00:02:10.979> little<00:02:11.280> bit<00:02:11.520> but<00:02:12.060> if<00:02:12.180> you<00:02:12.270> get<00:02:12.480> that<00:02:12.629> twist

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
a little bit but if you get that twist

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:15.040 
a little bit but if you get that twist
just<00:02:13.460> right<00:02:13.700> you<00:02:13.910> can<00:02:13.940> wind<00:02:14.360> it<00:02:14.510> a<00:02:14.630> lot<00:02:14.810> better

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:15.050

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:19.610 
see how we tied it in on one side the EP

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:22.180 
see how we tied it in on one side the EP
fibers<00:03:20.120> then<00:03:20.750> it's<00:03:20.989> pulled<00:03:21.290> over<00:03:21.590> tied<00:03:21.860> in<00:03:22.070> on

the other side a lot of people like to
criss<00:03:24.950> cross<00:03:25.330> over<00:03:26.330> that<00:03:26.510> we<00:03:27.080> find<00:03:27.350> that

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:27.470 
criss cross over that we find that

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:30.340 
criss cross over that we find that
really<00:03:27.800> time-consuming<00:03:28.690> really<00:03:29.690> messy<00:03:30.080> and

really time-consuming really messy and
with<00:03:30.680> this<00:03:30.920> you<00:03:31.160> have<00:03:31.340> more<00:03:31.670> of<00:03:31.730> a<00:03:31.850> control<00:03:32.300> you

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:32.480 
with this you have more of a control you

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:34.720 
with this you have more of a control you
can<00:03:32.660> make<00:03:32.810> a<00:03:32.840> real<00:03:33.110> flat<00:03:33.470> body<00:03:33.739> or<00:03:34.430> you<00:03:34.550> can
