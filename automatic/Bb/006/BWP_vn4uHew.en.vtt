won't come loose but I mean just taking
it<00:02:38.080> and<00:02:38.260> kind<00:02:38.530> of<00:02:38.620> working<00:02:39.190> it<00:02:39.280> around<00:02:39.400> a

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:39.730 
it and kind of working it around a

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:41.070 
it and kind of working it around a
little<00:02:39.820> bit

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:41.080 
little bit

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:43.550 
little bit
once<00:02:41.860> you<00:02:41.980> pull<00:02:42.160> it<00:02:42.280> down<00:02:42.310> and<00:02:42.730> we'll<00:02:42.820> at<00:02:42.970> sea

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
once you pull it down and we'll at sea

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:45.509 
once you pull it down and we'll at sea
looking<00:02:44.560> through<00:02:44.739> the<00:02:44.830> top<00:02:45.040> here<00:02:45.250> there's<00:02:45.459> a

00:02:45.509 --> 00:02:45.519 
looking through the top here there's a

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:48.350 
looking through the top here there's a
plastic<00:02:46.030> tube<00:02:46.480> coming<00:02:47.080> from<00:02:47.170> the<00:02:47.530> pump<00:02:47.769> and

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 
plastic tube coming from the pump and

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:52.290 
plastic tube coming from the pump and
there's<00:02:49.360> a<00:02:49.420> little<00:02:49.660> plastic<00:02:50.760> tie<00:02:51.760> that's

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:52.300 
there's a little plastic tie that's

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:55.860 
there's a little plastic tie that's
holding<00:02:52.720> it<00:02:52.810> onto<00:02:53.800> the<00:02:53.890> plastic<00:02:54.100> piece<00:02:54.870> best

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:55.870 
holding it onto the plastic piece best

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:58.380 
holding it onto the plastic piece best
yeah<00:02:56.130> just<00:02:57.130> kind<00:02:57.430> of<00:02:57.489> wiggled<00:02:57.790> it<00:02:57.880> around<00:02:58.120> and

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:58.390 
yeah just kind of wiggled it around and

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:01.520 
yeah just kind of wiggled it around and
I<00:02:58.480> think<00:02:58.720> we're<00:02:59.050> wheels<00:02:59.400> blocking<00:03:00.400> the<00:03:00.580> flow

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
I think we're wheels blocking the flow

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:07.830 
I think we're wheels blocking the flow
broke<00:03:02.530> loose<00:03:02.830> and<00:03:04.860> it<00:03:05.860> started<00:03:06.190> working<00:03:06.840> so

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:07.840 
broke loose and it started working so

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:09.840 
broke loose and it started working so
all<00:03:08.019> it's<00:03:08.200> left<00:03:08.440> then<00:03:08.650> is<00:03:08.830> to<00:03:08.980> put<00:03:09.160> screws<00:03:09.550> back

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:09.850 
all it's left then is to put screws back

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:13.410 
all it's left then is to put screws back
and<00:03:10.239> give<00:03:11.080> a<00:03:11.110> shot<00:03:11.440> and<00:03:11.620> run<00:03:12.549> a<00:03:12.820> little<00:03:13.180> bit<00:03:13.299> of

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:13.420 
and give a shot and run a little bit of

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:15.380 
and give a shot and run a little bit of
water<00:03:13.570> through<00:03:13.840> a<00:03:13.870> couple<00:03:14.350> times<00:03:15.130> without
