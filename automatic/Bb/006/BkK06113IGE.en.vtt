robotic but a 3d hand okay so here we go
this<00:01:35.310> is<00:01:35.369> the<00:01:35.729> initial<00:01:36.510> cyborg<00:01:37.110> Beast<00:01:37.880> so

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880

this is the initial cyborg Beast so
that's<00:01:39.060> the<00:01:39.180> fully<00:01:39.390> mechanical<00:01:39.990> design<00:01:40.670> so

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
that's the fully mechanical design so

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:42.950 
that's the fully mechanical design so
you've<00:01:41.820> had<00:01:41.970> a<00:01:42.030> chance<00:01:42.180> to<00:01:42.360> use<00:01:42.540> this<00:01:42.690> a<00:01:42.750> little

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:47.780 
and useful yeah it's useful for carrying

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:50.890 
and useful yeah it's useful for carrying
boxes<00:01:47.990> right<00:01:48.620> attention<00:01:49.310> because<00:01:50.120> this<00:01:50.600> one

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:50.900 
boxes right attention because this one

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:53.170 
boxes right attention because this one
doesn't<00:01:51.040> really<00:01:52.040> grab<00:01:52.340> if<00:01:52.550> I<00:01:52.670> grab<00:01:52.910> some<00:01:53.120> of

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:53.180 
doesn't really grab if I grab some of

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:54.820 
doesn't really grab if I grab some of
those<00:01:53.330> we'll<00:01:53.540> just<00:01:53.570> fold<00:01:54.110> out<00:01:54.410> but<00:01:54.650> these

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:54.830 
those we'll just fold out but these

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:58.210 
those we'll just fold out but these
isn't<00:01:55.190> more<00:01:55.900> even<00:01:56.900> more<00:01:56.930> grip<00:01:57.620> and<00:01:57.860> all<00:01:57.980> that

00:01:58.210 --> 00:01:58.220 
isn't more even more grip and all that

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:01.990 
isn't more even more grip and all that
it<00:01:58.340> goes<00:01:58.550> but<00:01:59.000> nice<00:01:59.720> okay<00:02:00.230> so<00:02:00.590> yeah<00:02:01.130> it's

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:02.000 
it goes but nice okay so yeah it's

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.510 
it goes but nice okay so yeah it's
amazing<00:02:02.210> or<00:02:02.540> even<00:02:02.840> comparing<00:02:03.470> a<00:02:03.620> fifty<00:02:04.490> dollar

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:04.520 
amazing or even comparing a fifty dollar

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:09.310 
amazing or even comparing a fifty dollar
device<00:02:05.510> with<00:02:05.810> a<00:02:06.250> $47,000<00:02:07.250> -<00:02:07.640> but<00:02:08.080> that's<00:02:09.080> great

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:09.320 
device with a $47,000 - but that's great

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:13.240 
device with a $47,000 - but that's great
that<00:02:09.500> it's<00:02:09.619> been<00:02:09.860> useful<00:02:10.810> this<00:02:11.810> one<00:02:12.080> I<00:02:12.380> had<00:02:13.010> for

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.250 
that it's been useful this one I had for

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:16.810 
that it's been useful this one I had for
about<00:02:13.490> three<00:02:13.970> years<00:02:14.350> but<00:02:15.350> the<00:02:15.890> thing<00:02:15.920> is<00:02:16.190> the

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:16.820 
about three years but the thing is the

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:20.710 
about three years but the thing is the
three<00:02:17.560> first<00:02:18.560> fingers<00:02:18.950> move<00:02:19.280> grasp<00:02:20.030> but<00:02:20.510> the

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720 
three first fingers move grasp but the

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:24.180 
three first fingers move grasp but the
other<00:02:20.900> two<00:02:21.500> just<00:02:22.250> they're<00:02:22.610> just<00:02:22.880> not<00:02:23.690> really

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:24.190 
other two just they're just not really

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:28.240 
other two just they're just not really
for<00:02:25.190> anything<00:02:25.820> just<00:02:25.970> for<00:02:26.450> I<00:02:26.840> just<00:02:27.560> cosmetic

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.250 
for anything just for I just cosmetic

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:32.650 
for anything just for I just cosmetic
for<00:02:28.430> whatever<00:02:28.550> but<00:02:30.760> after<00:02:31.760> the<00:02:31.910> element<00:02:32.240> of<00:02:32.270> 3d

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:32.660 
for whatever but after the element of 3d

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:35.860 
for whatever but after the element of 3d
one<00:02:32.870> has<00:02:33.200> all<00:02:33.530> functional<00:02:34.520> a<00:02:34.640> of<00:02:34.970> a<00:02:35.209> finger<00:02:35.600> so

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:35.870 
one has all functional a of a finger so

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:36.910 
one has all functional a of a finger so
I<00:02:35.900> like<00:02:36.200> that<00:02:36.440> better

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920 
I like that better

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:39.160 
I like that better
so<00:02:37.520> you<00:02:37.610> actually<00:02:38.030> work<00:02:38.660> in<00:02:38.840> an<00:02:38.959> environment

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:39.170 
so you actually work in an environment

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:41.260 
so you actually work in an environment
involves<00:02:39.860> a<00:02:40.040> lot<00:02:40.190> of<00:02:40.220> lifting<00:02:40.790> yeah<00:02:41.060> how<00:02:41.239> is

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:41.270 
involves a lot of lifting yeah how is

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:45.220 
involves a lot of lifting yeah how is
that<00:02:41.540> been<00:02:41.780> in<00:02:42.050> terms<00:02:42.320> of<00:02:42.610> using<00:02:43.610> that<00:02:44.020> versus

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:45.230 
that been in terms of using that versus

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:47.290 
that been in terms of using that versus
not<00:02:45.500> using<00:02:45.890> one<00:02:46.100> or<00:02:46.220> using<00:02:46.430> different<00:02:46.790> yeah

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:47.300 
not using one or using different yeah

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:48.729 
not using one or using different yeah
when<00:02:47.510> I<00:02:47.540> use<00:02:47.780> that<00:02:47.810> when<00:02:48.170> I<00:02:48.200> could<00:02:48.260> pick<00:02:48.590> up

00:02:48.729 --> 00:02:48.739 
when I use that when I could pick up

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:50.860 
when I use that when I could pick up
better<00:02:49.040> box<00:02:49.370> to<00:02:49.580> the<00:02:49.700> fitness<00:02:49.940> of<00:02:50.209> Roberts

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:50.870 
better box to the fitness of Roberts

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:53.350 
better box to the fitness of Roberts
straighter<00:02:51.320> than<00:02:51.590> this<00:02:51.830> so<00:02:52.700> that<00:02:52.940> that<00:02:53.090> makes

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:53.360 
straighter than this so that that makes

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:55.990 
straighter than this so that that makes
a<00:02:53.510> lot<00:02:53.690> but<00:02:53.930> it<00:02:54.050> really<00:02:54.230> could<00:02:54.550> both<00:02:55.550> fingers

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:56.000 
a lot but it really could both fingers

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.410 
a lot but it really could both fingers
effect<00:02:56.390> more<00:02:57.230> out<00:02:57.470> instead<00:02:58.070> of<00:02:58.130> curve<00:02:58.519> okay<00:02:59.120> so

00:02:59.410 --> 00:02:59.420 
effect more out instead of curve okay so

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:00.910 
effect more out instead of curve okay so
then<00:02:59.570> the<00:02:59.720> fingers<00:03:00.110> aren't<00:03:00.320> actually<00:03:00.680> having

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:00.920 
then the fingers aren't actually having

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:02.380 
then the fingers aren't actually having
to<00:03:01.010> carry<00:03:01.250> the<00:03:01.400> full<00:03:01.610> weight<00:03:01.790> of<00:03:01.820> the<00:03:01.940> box

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:02.390 
to carry the full weight of the box

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:03.729 
to carry the full weight of the box
there<00:03:02.570> right<00:03:02.690> kind<00:03:02.930> of<00:03:02.959> wrapping<00:03:03.320> out<00:03:03.410> right

00:03:03.729 --> 00:03:03.739 
there right kind of wrapping out right

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:05.920 
there right kind of wrapping out right
right<00:03:04.190> so<00:03:04.850> it's<00:03:05.030> not<00:03:05.090> going<00:03:05.360> to<00:03:05.540> much<00:03:05.690> ten

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:05.930 
right so it's not going to much ten

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:07.479 
right so it's not going to much ten
right<00:03:06.080> and<00:03:06.200> that's<00:03:06.350> good<00:03:06.560> okay<00:03:06.920> and<00:03:07.160> then<00:03:07.310> just

00:03:07.479 --> 00:03:07.489 
right and that's good okay and then just

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:09.910 
right and that's good okay and then just
like<00:03:07.910> when<00:03:08.269> I<00:03:08.299> bend<00:03:08.630> my<00:03:08.750> wrist<00:03:08.959> it'll<00:03:09.320> just<00:03:09.500> I

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:09.920 
like when I bend my wrist it'll just I

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:11.979 
like when I bend my wrist it'll just I
get<00:03:10.100> enough<00:03:10.370> grip<00:03:11.060> on<00:03:11.209> the<00:03:11.330> bottom<00:03:11.510> of<00:03:11.780> it<00:03:11.959> so

00:03:11.979 --> 00:03:11.989 
get enough grip on the bottom of it so

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:14.530 
get enough grip on the bottom of it so
I'm<00:03:12.170> more<00:03:12.350> like<00:03:12.560> your<00:03:12.739> palm<00:03:13.070> right<00:03:13.580> right

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:14.540
