00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.710 
for calcium and then I have another one
for<00:00:25.230> potassium<00:00:26.039> but<00:00:26.519> this<00:00:26.699> is<00:00:26.849> fat<00:00:27.090> cat<00:00:27.359> skinny

tetiny<00:01:55.950> so<00:01:56.820> tense<00:01:57.240> to<00:01:57.420> the<00:01:57.509> point<00:01:57.719> of<00:01:57.840> tetiny

00:01:59.740 --> 00:01:59.750 
tetiny so tense to the point of tetiny

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:02.120 
tetiny so tense to the point of tetiny
bradycardia<00:02:00.750> why<00:02:01.350> do<00:02:01.409> we<00:02:01.560> know<00:02:01.680> about<00:02:01.799> calcium

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
bradycardia why do we know about calcium

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:03.859 
bradycardia why do we know about calcium
everybody<00:02:03.000> act<00:02:03.149> like<00:02:03.299> I<00:02:03.360> just<00:02:03.570> gave<00:02:03.719> you<00:02:03.750> a

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
everybody act like I just gave you a

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:08.620 
everybody act like I just gave you a
calcium<00:02:04.259> channel<00:02:04.560> blocker

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:08.630 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:13.450 

so<00:02:09.010> bradycardia<00:02:10.010> there's<00:02:10.850> no<00:02:11.060> roof<00:02:12.460> because

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:13.460 
so bradycardia there's no roof because

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:18.460 
so bradycardia there's no roof because
we're<00:02:13.610> hypocalcemic<00:02:14.530> so<00:02:15.530> bradycardia<00:02:16.100> I<00:02:17.470> put

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:18.470 
we're hypocalcemic so bradycardia I put

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:23.710 
we're hypocalcemic so bradycardia I put
calcium<00:02:18.770> I<00:02:19.250> put<00:02:19.490> both<00:02:20.450> units<00:02:21.550> so<00:02:22.550> you<00:02:23.390> see<00:02:23.600> in

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:23.720 
calcium I put both units so you see in

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:26.230 
calcium I put both units so you see in
both<00:02:23.900> ways<00:02:24.170> so<00:02:24.860> it<00:02:25.190> may<00:02:25.370> be<00:02:25.400> the<00:02:25.580> four<00:02:25.970> to<00:02:26.060> five

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:26.240 
both ways so it may be the four to five

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:28.420 
both ways so it may be the four to five
millionths<00:02:27.230> per<00:02:27.440> liter

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430 
millionths per liter

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:31.600 
millionths per liter
sometimes<00:02:29.120> calcium<00:02:29.660> can<00:02:29.930> be<00:02:30.460> reported<00:02:31.460> in

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:31.610 
sometimes calcium can be reported in

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:34.630 
sometimes calcium can be reported in
milligrams<00:02:32.120> per<00:02:32.420> deciliter<00:02:33.310> it<00:02:34.310> really

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:34.640 
milligrams per deciliter it really

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:37.990 
milligrams per deciliter it really
depends<00:02:35.060> on<00:02:35.180> what<00:02:36.170> your<00:02:36.380> lab<00:02:36.620> does<00:02:37.010> and

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.000 
depends on what your lab does and

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.150 
depends on what your lab does and
honestly<00:02:38.450> I'm<00:02:38.630> not<00:02:38.780> sure<00:02:38.840> what<00:02:39.200> NCLEX<00:02:39.740> will<00:02:39.980> do

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:40.160 
honestly I'm not sure what NCLEX will do

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.970 
honestly I'm not sure what NCLEX will do
so<00:02:40.730> I<00:02:41.120> would<00:02:41.450> imagine<00:02:41.540> millions<00:02:42.020> per<00:02:42.770> liter

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:42.980 
so I would imagine millions per liter

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:44.620 
so I would imagine millions per liter
it's<00:02:43.190> kind<00:02:43.370> of<00:02:43.460> the<00:02:43.580> standard<00:02:43.850> and<00:02:44.240> everything

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:44.630 
it's kind of the standard and everything

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:46.000 
it's kind of the standard and everything
else<00:02:44.840> is<00:02:45.020> reported<00:02:45.530> in<00:02:45.650> milliequivalents<00:02:45.950> per

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.010 
else is reported in milliequivalents per

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:49.990 
else is reported in milliequivalents per
liter<00:02:47.260> but<00:02:48.260> just<00:02:48.530> in<00:02:48.680> case<00:02:48.710> we'll<00:02:49.670> have<00:02:49.880> the

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:50.000 
liter but just in case we'll have the

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.440 
liter but just in case we'll have the
other<00:02:50.120> one

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:50.450 
other one

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:52.780 
other one
notice<00:02:51.020> it's<00:02:51.170> about<00:02:51.380> double<00:02:51.680> though<00:02:52.010> so<00:02:52.640> if

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:52.790 
notice it's about double though so if

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:54.850 
notice it's about double though so if
you<00:02:52.940> remember<00:02:53.180> four<00:02:53.540> to<00:02:53.660> five<00:02:53.840> millionths<00:02:54.680> per

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:54.860 
you remember four to five millionths per

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:56.620 
you remember four to five millionths per
liter<00:02:55.070> for<00:02:55.190> calcium<00:02:55.730> and<00:02:55.880> then<00:02:56.030> you<00:02:56.120> double<00:02:56.510> it

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:56.630 
liter for calcium and then you double it

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:59.320 
liter for calcium and then you double it
it'll<00:02:57.200> get<00:02:57.320> you<00:02:57.440> in<00:02:57.530> the<00:02:57.590> ballpark<00:02:58.180> it'll<00:02:59.180> get

00:02:59.320 --> 00:02:59.330 
it'll get you in the ballpark it'll get

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:01.560 
it'll get you in the ballpark it'll get
you<00:02:59.480> so<00:02:59.630> that<00:02:59.810> you<00:02:59.960> can<00:03:00.050> answer<00:03:00.260> questions

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:01.570 
you so that you can answer questions

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:04.840 
you so that you can answer questions
okay<00:03:02.570> now<00:03:03.020> so<00:03:03.470> that's<00:03:03.650> that<00:03:03.980> skinny<00:03:04.430> cat<00:03:04.670> does

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:41.070 

cardiac<00:04:35.600> wise<00:04:36.970> for<00:04:37.970> hypercalcemia<00:04:38.960> at<00:04:39.890> first

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:41.080 
cardiac wise for hypercalcemia at first

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:44.860 
cardiac wise for hypercalcemia at first
so<00:04:42.080> somebody's<00:04:42.740> hypercalcemia<00:04:43.720> but<00:04:44.720> it's

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:44.870 
so somebody's hypercalcemia but it's

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:48.970 
so somebody's hypercalcemia but it's
it's<00:04:45.200> it's<00:04:45.620> in<00:04:45.860> the<00:04:45.950> low<00:04:46.900> high<00:04:47.900> high<00:04:48.410> end<00:04:48.830> of

it's it's in the low high high end of
normal<00:04:49.040> you<00:04:49.700> know<00:04:49.730> so<00:04:50.090> they're<00:04:50.480> hypercalcemia

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:51.020 
normal you know so they're hypercalcemia

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:55.600 
normal you know so they're hypercalcemia
but<00:04:52.010> it<00:04:52.280> is<00:04:52.600> maybe<00:04:53.600> you<00:04:54.500> know<00:04:54.590> the<00:04:54.710> level<00:04:55.100> is<00:04:55.280> at

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:55.610 
but it is maybe you know the level is at

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:58.420 
but it is maybe you know the level is at
six<00:04:56.570> millions<00:04:57.440> per<00:04:57.620> liter<00:04:57.830> so<00:04:58.130> they're<00:04:58.250> just

00:04:58.420 --> 00:04:58.430 
six millions per liter so they're just

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:02.020 
six millions per liter so they're just
barely<00:04:59.800> that<00:05:00.800> person<00:05:01.460> we're<00:05:01.760> going<00:05:01.790> to<00:05:01.910> be

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:02.030 
barely that person we're going to be

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:04.270 
barely that person we're going to be
looking<00:05:02.420> for<00:05:02.800> increased<00:05:03.800> cardiac

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:04.280 
looking for increased cardiac

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:06.520 
looking for increased cardiac
contraction<00:05:04.880> and<00:05:05.360> maybe<00:05:05.780> some<00:05:06.080> some

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:06.530 
contraction and maybe some some

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:08.830 
contraction and maybe some some
tachycardia<00:05:07.490> because<00:05:08.090> we've<00:05:08.240> got<00:05:08.390> more<00:05:08.570> umph

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:08.840 
tachycardia because we've got more umph

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:11.740 
tachycardia because we've got more umph
right<00:05:09.230> there<00:05:10.040> hypercalcemia<00:05:10.880> so<00:05:11.480> we've<00:05:11.600> got

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:11.750 
right there hypercalcemia so we've got

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:14.830 
right there hypercalcemia so we've got
more<00:05:12.070> now<00:05:13.070> if<00:05:13.580> we<00:05:13.850> don't<00:05:14.030> pick<00:05:14.240> up<00:05:14.420> on<00:05:14.600> these

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:14.840 
more now if we don't pick up on these

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:19.030 
more now if we don't pick up on these
symptoms<00:05:15.260> and<00:05:15.820> it<00:05:16.820> becomes<00:05:17.240> worse<00:05:18.010> they<00:05:19.010> are

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:19.040 
symptoms and it becomes worse they are

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:21.850 
symptoms and it becomes worse they are
actually<00:05:19.790> going<00:05:19.940> to<00:05:20.030> get<00:05:20.860> bradycardia

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:21.860 
actually going to get bradycardia

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:24.820 
actually going to get bradycardia
because<00:05:22.610> then<00:05:22.820> what<00:05:23.030> happens<00:05:23.060> is<00:05:23.750> the<00:05:24.530> calcium

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:24.830 
because then what happens is the calcium

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:26.830 
because then what happens is the calcium
has<00:05:25.280> to<00:05:25.430> be<00:05:25.520> able<00:05:25.700> to<00:05:25.790> drop<00:05:26.030> down<00:05:26.330> into<00:05:26.720> those

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:26.840 
has to be able to drop down into those

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:29.830 
has to be able to drop down into those
channels<00:05:26.900> for<00:05:27.650> the<00:05:27.740> umph<00:05:27.970> but<00:05:28.970> if<00:05:29.330> you<00:05:29.600> get<00:05:29.810> all

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:29.840 
channels for the umph but if you get all

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:32.560 
channels for the umph but if you get all
this<00:05:30.320> calcium<00:05:30.650> out<00:05:31.100> here<00:05:31.520> it<00:05:31.670> they<00:05:32.150> all<00:05:32.300> kind

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:32.570 
this calcium out here it they all kind

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:33.910 
this calcium out here it they all kind
of<00:05:32.630> run<00:05:32.840> into<00:05:33.110> each<00:05:33.230> other<00:05:33.440> it's<00:05:33.590> like<00:05:33.650> two

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:33.920 
of run into each other it's like two

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:35.290 
of run into each other it's like two
guys<00:05:34.160> trying<00:05:34.550> to<00:05:34.610> go<00:05:34.760> through<00:05:35.000> a<00:05:35.060> door

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:35.300 
guys trying to go through a door

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:37.450 
guys trying to go through a door
together<00:05:35.510> you<00:05:35.900> know<00:05:36.170> nobody<00:05:36.800> can<00:05:37.040> get<00:05:37.220> in

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:37.460 
together you know nobody can get in

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:40.630 
together you know nobody can get in
because<00:05:38.300> they're<00:05:38.540> blocking<00:05:38.840> the<00:05:39.470> channel<00:05:39.980> so

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:40.640 
because they're blocking the channel so

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:43.210 
because they're blocking the channel so
if<00:05:40.880> you<00:05:40.970> get<00:05:41.150> too<00:05:41.390> much<00:05:41.630> calcium<00:05:42.020> it<00:05:42.590> ends<00:05:43.130> up

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:43.220 
if you get too much calcium it ends up

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:46.440 
if you get too much calcium it ends up
they<00:05:43.550> end<00:05:43.790> up<00:05:43.970> with<00:05:44.630> bradycardia<00:05:45.250> because

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:46.450 
they end up with bradycardia because

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:50.950 
they end up with bradycardia because
nobody<00:05:47.450> can<00:05:47.690> get<00:05:47.900> in<00:05:47.990> the<00:05:48.080> channels<00:05:49.630> but<00:05:50.630> early

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:50.960 
nobody can get in the channels but early

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:53.560 
nobody can get in the channels but early
on<00:05:51.760> there's<00:05:52.760> going<00:05:52.910> to<00:05:52.970> actually<00:05:53.360> be<00:05:53.480> a<00:05:53.510> little

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:53.570 
on there's going to actually be a little

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:57.550 
on there's going to actually be a little
more<00:05:53.930> umph<00:05:55.150> so<00:05:56.150> maybe<00:05:56.780> a<00:05:56.870> little<00:05:57.020> stress<00:05:57.320> on

00:05:57.550 --> 00:05:57.560 
more umph so maybe a little stress on

00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:02.350 
more umph so maybe a little stress on
the<00:05:57.680> heart<00:05:59.170> so<00:06:00.170> fat<00:06:00.440> cat<00:06:00.710> skinny<00:06:01.010> cat<00:06:01.280> if<00:06:02.180> it

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:02.360 
the heart so fat cat skinny cat if it

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:04.120 
the heart so fat cat skinny cat if it
helps<00:06:02.600> you<00:06:02.750> remember<00:06:02.900> signs<00:06:03.440> and<00:06:03.710> symptoms

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:04.130 
helps you remember signs and symptoms

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:07.570 
helps you remember signs and symptoms
good<00:06:05.050> if<00:06:06.050> it<00:06:06.260> doesn't<00:06:06.650> you<00:06:07.070> know<00:06:07.130> you<00:06:07.340> can<00:06:07.490> let

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:07.580 
good if it doesn't you know you can let

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:09.820 
good if it doesn't you know you can let
it<00:06:07.700> go
