sort<00:01:50.720> of<00:01:52.270> thickness<00:01:53.270> and<00:01:54.100> it<00:01:55.100> seems<00:01:55.790> to<00:01:55.910> hold

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:56.180 
sort of thickness and it seems to hold

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:58.600 
sort of thickness and it seems to hold
quite<00:01:56.600> well<00:01:56.840> this<00:01:57.170> is<00:01:57.380> just<00:01:57.410> a<00:01:57.710> Wilton<00:01:58.130> rolling

00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:58.610 
quite well this is just a Wilton rolling

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:01.870 
quite well this is just a Wilton rolling
pin<00:01:59.170> that<00:02:00.170> I<00:02:00.200> have<00:02:00.620> and<00:02:01.040> it<00:02:01.520> comes<00:02:01.730> with

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:01.880 
pin that I have and it comes with

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:04.030 
pin that I have and it comes with
another<00:02:02.360> size<00:02:02.660> little<00:02:03.200> spacer<00:02:03.710> which<00:02:03.860> is

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:04.040 
another size little spacer which is

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:06.400 
another size little spacer which is
thinner<00:02:04.370> as<00:02:04.610> well<00:02:04.850> so<00:02:05.600> you<00:02:05.690> can<00:02:05.870> choose<00:02:06.110> what

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:06.410 
thinner as well so you can choose what

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:09.309 
thinner as well so you can choose what
you<00:02:06.440> want<00:02:06.910> so<00:02:07.910> I'm<00:02:08.269> just<00:02:08.509> going<00:02:08.750> to<00:02:08.780> roll<00:02:09.080> up<00:02:09.289> my

00:02:09.309 --> 00:02:09.319 
you want so I'm just going to roll up my

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:15.520 
you want so I'm just going to roll up my
icing

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:15.530 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:21.949 

all<00:02:16.530> the<00:02:17.010> same<00:02:17.280> thickness

00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:21.959 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:25.759 

yo<00:02:22.799> and<00:02:23.239> so<00:02:24.239> once<00:02:24.450> we've<00:02:24.659> done<00:02:24.689> that<00:02:24.870> it<00:02:25.230> is

00:02:25.759 --> 00:02:25.769 
yo and so once we've done that it is

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:27.729 
yo and so once we've done that it is
simply<00:02:26.430> taking<00:02:26.819> your<00:02:26.939> plunger<00:02:27.150> cutter

00:02:27.729 --> 00:02:27.739 
simply taking your plunger cutter

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:30.890 
simply taking your plunger cutter
popping<00:02:28.739> it<00:02:28.829> on<00:02:29.040> the<00:02:29.310> surface<00:02:29.549> press<00:02:30.450> around

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
popping it on the surface press around

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.259 
popping it on the surface press around
the<00:02:31.140> edge<00:02:31.290> first<00:02:31.709> to<00:02:32.010> cut<00:02:32.250> it<00:02:32.430> and<00:02:32.700> then<00:02:33.209> you

00:02:33.259 --> 00:02:33.269 
the edge first to cut it and then you

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:35.089 
the edge first to cut it and then you
just<00:02:33.599> press<00:02:33.810> a<00:02:33.840> little<00:02:34.200> bit<00:02:34.349> on<00:02:34.500> the<00:02:34.620> top<00:02:34.859> and

00:02:35.089 --> 00:02:35.099 
just press a little bit on the top and

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:37.610 
just press a little bit on the top and
that<00:02:35.400> will<00:02:35.760> make<00:02:36.510> your<00:02:36.719> pattern<00:02:37.109> onto<00:02:37.379> your

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
that will make your pattern onto your

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:39.440 
that will make your pattern onto your
icing<00:02:38.010> and<00:02:38.189> then<00:02:38.819> you<00:02:38.969> just<00:02:39.180> take<00:02:39.389> your

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
icing and then you just take your

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:55.760 
icing and then you just take your
butterfly<00:02:40.079> out

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:55.770 

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:57.560 

like<00:02:56.310> that<00:02:56.610> so<00:02:57.030> I've<00:02:57.120> got<00:02:57.300> my<00:02:57.450> little

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:57.570 
like that so I've got my little

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:00.050 
like that so I've got my little
butterfly<00:02:57.960> and<00:02:58.800> then<00:02:59.520> I'm<00:02:59.670> going<00:02:59.820> to<00:02:59.850> bring<00:03:00.000> my

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
butterfly and then I'm going to bring my

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:04.400 
butterfly and then I'm going to bring my
egg<00:03:00.390> crate<00:03:00.690> over<00:03:01.050> and<00:03:01.820> then<00:03:02.820> you<00:03:03.270> just<00:03:03.540> lay<00:03:04.140> it

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:04.410 
egg crate over and then you just lay it

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:13.610 
egg crate over and then you just lay it
in<00:03:05.690> that<00:03:06.690> little<00:03:07.050> V<00:03:12.080> and<00:03:13.080> you<00:03:13.170> just<00:03:13.350> sort<00:03:13.530> of

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 
in that little V and you just sort of

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:16.040 
in that little V and you just sort of
hold<00:03:13.860> it<00:03:14.010> in<00:03:14.040> that<00:03:14.190> shape<00:03:14.490> and<00:03:14.730> so<00:03:15.360> it's<00:03:15.750> going

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:16.050 
hold it in that shape and so it's going

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:18.500 
hold it in that shape and so it's going
to<00:03:16.140> then<00:03:16.410> dry<00:03:16.830> with<00:03:16.860> a<00:03:17.220> little<00:03:17.610> flying<00:03:17.970> sort<00:03:18.420> of

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510 
to then dry with a little flying sort of

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:22.400 
to then dry with a little flying sort of
shape<00:03:18.750> to<00:03:18.990> it<00:03:19.020> and<00:03:19.820> that's<00:03:20.820> all<00:03:21.210> that's<00:03:21.900> very

shape to it and that's all that's very

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:25.460 
shape to it and that's all that's very
simple<00:03:22.890> at<00:03:23.100> when<00:03:24.060> these<00:03:24.360> finished<00:03:24.840> drying<00:03:25.200> I

using<00:04:11.160> the<00:04:11.280> plunger<00:04:11.640> cutter<00:04:11.880> and<00:04:12.240> it<00:04:12.960> even

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:13.290 
using the plunger cutter and it even

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:15.110 
using the plunger cutter and it even
creates<00:04:13.650> that<00:04:13.800> little<00:04:13.860> pattern<00:04:14.250> and<00:04:14.670> then

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:15.120 
creates that little pattern and then

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:17.630 
creates that little pattern and then
letting<00:04:15.390> them<00:04:15.600> dry<00:04:16.100> just<00:04:17.100> in<00:04:17.280> that<00:04:17.430> little

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:17.640 
letting them dry just in that little

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:20.479 
letting them dry just in that little
v-shaped<00:04:18.480> paper<00:04:19.350> so<00:04:19.859> that<00:04:20.040> they<00:04:20.160> get<00:04:20.340> that

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:20.489 
v-shaped paper so that they get that

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:22.760 
v-shaped paper so that they get that
little<00:04:20.670> flying<00:04:21.090> bit<00:04:21.330> so<00:04:21.930> the<00:04:22.140> last<00:04:22.350> little<00:04:22.500> bit

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:22.770 
little flying bit so the last little bit

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:24.050 
little flying bit so the last little bit
you<00:04:22.890> can<00:04:23.010> leave<00:04:23.160> them<00:04:23.280> like<00:04:23.490> that<00:04:23.700> looks

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:24.060 
you can leave them like that looks

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:25.760 
you can leave them like that looks
absolutely<00:04:24.390> beautiful<00:04:24.630> if<00:04:25.140> you<00:04:25.320> want<00:04:25.530> to<00:04:25.620> go<00:04:25.740> a

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:25.770 
absolutely beautiful if you want to go a

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:28.340 
absolutely beautiful if you want to go a
little<00:04:25.950> bit<00:04:26.310> further<00:04:26.610> then<00:04:27.540> you<00:04:27.960> just<00:04:28.170> get

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:28.350 
little bit further then you just get

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:32.290 
little bit further then you just get
these<00:04:28.500> little<00:04:28.830> tubes<00:04:29.160> of<00:04:30.020> shimmer<00:04:31.020> dust<00:04:31.260> and

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:32.300 
these little tubes of shimmer dust and

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:35.900 
these little tubes of shimmer dust and
they<00:04:33.300> are<00:04:34.280> available<00:04:35.280> at<00:04:35.430> most<00:04:35.580> cake

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:35.910 
they are available at most cake

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:38.600 
they are available at most cake
decorating<00:04:36.480> stores<00:04:36.780> and<00:04:37.140> then<00:04:37.890> all<00:04:38.220> you<00:04:38.400> use

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:38.610 
decorating stores and then all you use

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:40.820 
decorating stores and then all you use
is<00:04:38.850> a<00:04:38.880> little<00:04:39.180> bit<00:04:39.420> of<00:04:39.540> a<00:04:39.630> little<00:04:40.500> bit<00:04:40.620> on<00:04:40.650> the

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:40.830 
is a little bit of a little bit on the

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:44.030 
is a little bit of a little bit on the
end<00:04:40.950> of<00:04:41.040> a<00:04:41.100> paintbrush<00:04:41.520> and<00:04:42.620> then<00:04:43.620> you<00:04:43.800> just

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:44.040 
end of a paintbrush and then you just

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:45.260 
end of a paintbrush and then you just
literally<00:04:44.730> dust

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:45.270 
literally dust

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:47.840 
literally dust
I<00:04:45.360> sort<00:04:45.660> of<00:04:45.690> dust<00:04:46.020> down<00:04:46.230> the<00:04:46.440> middle<00:04:46.740> and<00:04:46.980> then

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:47.850 
I sort of dust down the middle and then

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:49.550 
I sort of dust down the middle and then
just<00:04:48.210> bring<00:04:48.390> it<00:04:48.540> up<00:04:48.690> a<00:04:48.840> little<00:04:49.020> bit<00:04:49.200> so<00:04:49.500> it

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:49.560 
just bring it up a little bit so it

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:51.750 
just bring it up a little bit so it
shimmers<00:04:50.000> over<00:04:51.000> the<00:04:51.120> rest<00:04:51.300> of<00:04:51.450> the<00:04:51.540> boat

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:51.760 
shimmers over the rest of the boat

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:56.370 
shimmers over the rest of the boat
fly<00:04:52.800> so<00:04:53.800> that's<00:04:54.100> a<00:04:54.280> silver<00:04:54.550> color<00:04:55.050> so<00:04:56.050> it<00:04:56.170> gives

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:56.380 
fly so that's a silver color so it gives

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:58.560 
fly so that's a silver color so it gives
it<00:04:56.530> sort<00:04:56.740> of<00:04:56.860> a<00:04:56.950> little<00:04:57.190> silvery<00:04:57.730> shimmer<00:04:58.210> and

00:04:58.560 --> 00:04:58.570 
it sort of a little silvery shimmer and

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:03.950 
it sort of a little silvery shimmer and
then<00:04:59.500> there's<00:05:00.040> also<00:05:00.370> a<00:05:00.640> white<00:05:02.250> off<00:05:03.250> my<00:05:03.550> brush

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:03.960 
then there's also a white off my brush

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:06.780 
then there's also a white off my brush
so<00:05:04.960> this<00:05:05.230> is<00:05:05.380> a<00:05:05.410> white<00:05:05.710> the<00:05:05.920> whiteness<00:05:06.370> silver

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:06.790 
so this is a white the whiteness silver

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:10.160 
so this is a white the whiteness silver
are<00:05:07.090> very<00:05:07.690> similar

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:10.170 

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:13.020 

grab<00:05:11.170> this<00:05:11.320> okay<00:05:11.770> so<00:05:12.070> again<00:05:12.250> I<00:05:12.520> usually<00:05:12.820> get

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:13.030 
grab this okay so again I usually get

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:14.460 
grab this okay so again I usually get
quite<00:05:13.270> a<00:05:13.300> bit<00:05:13.480> of<00:05:13.570> a<00:05:13.660> brush<00:05:13.900> and<00:05:14.110> dust<00:05:14.230> the

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:14.470 
quite a bit of a brush and dust the

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:16.790 
quite a bit of a brush and dust the
center<00:05:14.830> so<00:05:15.070> the<00:05:15.250> the<00:05:15.880> center<00:05:16.300> of<00:05:16.420> my<00:05:16.570> butterfly

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:16.800 
center so the the center of my butterfly

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:20.250 
center so the the center of my butterfly
has<00:05:17.800> the<00:05:18.070> most<00:05:18.280> shimmer<00:05:18.700> and<00:05:19.060> then<00:05:19.900> I<00:05:19.930> just

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:20.260 
has the most shimmer and then I just

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:21.900 
has the most shimmer and then I just
sort<00:05:20.470> of<00:05:20.530> brush<00:05:20.860> out<00:05:21.130> from<00:05:21.490> there<00:05:21.670> a<00:05:21.700> little

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:21.910 
sort of brush out from there a little

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:23.640 
sort of brush out from there a little
bit<00:05:22.120> giving<00:05:22.390> the<00:05:22.600> rest<00:05:22.810> of<00:05:23.020> the<00:05:23.110> leaves<00:05:23.350> and

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:23.650 
bit giving the rest of the leaves and

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:25.980 
bit giving the rest of the leaves and
this<00:05:24.100> is<00:05:24.280> just<00:05:24.490> dry<00:05:24.760> so<00:05:25.120> this<00:05:25.300> is<00:05:25.510> not<00:05:25.690> wetting

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:25.990 
this is just dry so this is not wetting

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:28.290 
this is just dry so this is not wetting
anything<00:05:26.530> it<00:05:27.010> just<00:05:27.070> adds<00:05:27.490> a<00:05:27.670> tiny<00:05:27.970> little

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:28.300 
anything it just adds a tiny little

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:32.660 
anything it just adds a tiny little
shimmer<00:05:28.540> to<00:05:28.810> it<00:05:29.010> this<00:05:30.010> is<00:05:30.190> a<00:05:30.220> bronze<00:05:30.640> color

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:32.670 
shimmer to it this is a bronze color

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:35.510 
shimmer to it this is a bronze color
I'll<00:05:33.670> show<00:05:33.850> you<00:05:34.000> what<00:05:34.090> the<00:05:34.210> bronze<00:05:34.450> looks<00:05:34.870> like

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:35.520 
I'll show you what the bronze looks like

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:38.310 
I'll show you what the bronze looks like
so<00:05:36.520> the<00:05:36.670> bronze<00:05:36.940> obviously<00:05:37.570> changes<00:05:38.140> the

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:38.320 
so the bronze obviously changes the

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:42.180 
so the bronze obviously changes the
color<00:05:38.850> slightly<00:05:39.850> of<00:05:40.120> the<00:05:41.050> purple<00:05:41.470> and<00:05:41.770> gives

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:42.190 
color slightly of the purple and gives

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:43.770 
color slightly of the purple and gives
it<00:05:42.310> a<00:05:42.400> different<00:05:42.790> kind<00:05:42.910> of<00:05:43.060> color<00:05:43.270> of<00:05:43.450> the<00:05:43.540> top

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:43.780 
it a different kind of color of the top

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:45.870 
it a different kind of color of the top
now<00:05:44.560> you<00:05:44.620> can<00:05:44.890> use<00:05:45.070> these<00:05:45.280> come<00:05:45.520> in<00:05:45.640> a<00:05:45.730> whole

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:45.880 
now you can use these come in a whole

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:47.160 
now you can use these come in a whole
bunch<00:05:46.030> of<00:05:46.150> different<00:05:46.390> colors<00:05:46.690> so<00:05:46.720> you<00:05:46.930> can<00:05:46.990> do

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:47.170 
bunch of different colors so you can do

00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:50.610 
bunch of different colors so you can do
a<00:05:47.200> whole<00:05:47.620> bunch<00:05:47.920> of<00:05:48.040> different<00:05:48.370> colors<00:05:48.700> to<00:05:49.620> mix

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:50.620 
a whole bunch of different colors to mix

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:52.200 
a whole bunch of different colors to mix
and<00:05:50.890> match<00:05:51.010> with<00:05:51.040> what<00:05:51.400> you<00:05:51.520> want<00:05:51.700> and<00:05:51.880> some<00:05:52.060> of

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:52.210 
and match with what you want and some of

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:54.060 
and match with what you want and some of
them<00:05:52.330> also<00:05:52.600> come<00:05:53.020> in<00:05:53.230> not<00:05:53.620> so<00:05:53.860> shimmery

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:54.070 
them also come in not so shimmery

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:56.760 
them also come in not so shimmery
they're<00:05:54.520> just<00:05:54.730> sort<00:05:54.820> of<00:05:54.970> a<00:05:55.060> basic<00:05:55.360> color<00:05:56.350> dust

00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:56.770 
they're just sort of a basic color dust

00:05:56.770 --> 00:05:59.790 
they're just sort of a basic color dust
and<00:05:57.100> you<00:05:57.640> can<00:05:57.850> paint<00:05:58.180> on<00:05:58.420> different<00:05:58.810> colors<00:05:59.140> or

00:05:59.790 --> 00:05:59.800 
and you can paint on different colors or

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:01.920 
and you can paint on different colors or
you<00:06:00.070> can<00:06:00.250> dust<00:06:00.460> on<00:06:00.670> different<00:06:01.030> colors<00:06:01.360> so

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:01.930 
you can dust on different colors so

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:04.190 
you can dust on different colors so
those<00:06:02.170> are<00:06:02.320> your<00:06:02.440> three<00:06:02.500> butterflies<00:06:03.190> and

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:04.200 
those are your three butterflies and

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:07.020 
those are your three butterflies and
that<00:06:05.200> is<00:06:05.530> just<00:06:05.800> the<00:06:06.010> simplest<00:06:06.400> way<00:06:06.610> to<00:06:06.670> finish

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:07.030 
that is just the simplest way to finish

00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:07.260 
that is just the simplest way to finish
it

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:07.270 
it

silver<00:06:07.870> is<00:06:07.990> my<00:06:08.170> favorite<00:06:08.680> to<00:06:08.830> do<00:06:08.980> but<00:06:09.250> again

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:09.850 
silver is my favorite to do but again

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:11.790 
silver is my favorite to do but again
depending<00:06:10.120> on<00:06:10.480> the<00:06:10.600> background<00:06:11.050> color<00:06:11.290> I<00:06:11.530> tend

00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:11.800 
depending on the background color I tend

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:13.140 
depending on the background color I tend
to<00:06:11.860> do<00:06:11.980> quite<00:06:12.010> pastel<00:06:12.640> ease<00:06:12.790> like<00:06:12.910> this

00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:13.150 
to do quite pastel ease like this

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:14.730 
to do quite pastel ease like this
although<00:06:13.780> that<00:06:14.140> would<00:06:14.290> look<00:06:14.380> really<00:06:14.440> pretty

00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:14.740 
although that would look really pretty

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:17.400 
although that would look really pretty
on<00:06:15.190> something<00:06:15.880> like<00:06:15.970> an<00:06:16.150> orange<00:06:16.510> or<00:06:16.840> a<00:06:16.900> yellow

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:17.410 
on something like an orange or a yellow

00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:20.040 
on something like an orange or a yellow

or white butterfly that sort of more

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:22.800 
or white butterfly that sort of more
bronzy<00:06:20.770> color<00:06:21.010> and<00:06:21.280> but<00:06:21.910> definitely<00:06:22.450> sort<00:06:22.720> of

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:22.810 
bronzy color and but definitely sort of

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:24.540 
bronzy color and but definitely sort of
