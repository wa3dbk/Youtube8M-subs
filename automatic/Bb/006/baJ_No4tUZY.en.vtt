00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:07.529
 hello today I'm going to teach you how to do this 

00:00:03.249 --> 00:00:07.529
 mini album for savings made with envelope 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:17.500
 The materials that you will need are 

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:20.220
 Cardboards and decorated paper 

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:20.220
 on 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:24.600
 glue of your preference 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.759
 pencil ruler and scissors 

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:31.660
 Velcro 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:37.730
 paper for lining books 

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:39.600
 and decorative elements like 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:42.090
 drilling machines 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:45.800
 wsi p 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.800
 them what you can think of 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:49.719
 i 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:54.730
 we will start making the covers take 

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:57.460
 a card of the color you want and 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:59.620
 the envelopes that you are going to use me in 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:02.890
 this case I will use an American envelope 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:04.850
 of 22 x 11 centimeters but you can 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:07.430
 use the one you want 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:09.170
 but you should keep in mind that the envelope 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:12.159
 have a size greater than that of 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:12.159
 tickets of your country 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.980
 next we are going to need a 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.200
 rectangle that is two wide 

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:20.940
 centimeters larger than the envelope for 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:24.150
 leave a margin on each side of a 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:26.340
 centimeter long must measure 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:29.520
 triple the extent of the act of the envelope 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:32.340
 I will use according to the measurements of mine 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:35.450
 a rectangle that will measure 24 x 35 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.450
 centimeters long 

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:40.460
 the first mark will be one centimeter 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:42.710
 greater than the act of the envelope 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:44.990
 another one centimeter and a half centimeter 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:48.020
 for the wolf although this will depend on 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:51.590
 how many envelopes are you going to use and 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:54.340
 we repeat again these two measures and 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:56.890
 we leave the rest for the lid 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:59.250
 I will do it according to the measures of the 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:59.250
 mine 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:16.069
 and with some rounded tip we're going to 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:18.760
 join the marks this will help us later to 

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:18.760
 bend better 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:22.030
 i 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:26.790
 once marked double 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:42.070
 and it will remain that way 

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:49.850
 now we will go to the envelopes you take the 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:49.850
 that you go to need and close the 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:03.230
 if you prefer to cut only the lapel 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:06.940
 but I will stick it so that the 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:06.940
 two sides of the same size 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:26.180
 with a cutter or scissors open it by the 

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:26.180
 upper part 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:40.209
 once they are all open 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:43.120
 take a card of the same color or 

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:45.910
 different if you prefer and the strips of 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:48.209
 length of the envelope and three centimeters of 

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:48.209
 years 

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:54.400
 cut them out and fold in half 

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:02.230
 Apply the glue to both sides of the 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:04.659
 double 

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:06.990
 I will use double-sided tape that sticks 

00:04:04.659 --> 00:04:09.510
 fairly good 

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:11.970
 and one of the envelopes 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:15.599
 but one side one for the closed part 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:18.680
 of the envelope avoiding that the double arrives and 

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:18.680
 on the other the second 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:33.919
 the next one we'll join it like that stick a 

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:36.430
 side of another strip on one of them and by 

00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:39.220
 the other side a new one 

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:42.040
 once you have all this will go like this 

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:44.820
 to join it the cover sticks another strip to 

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:44.820
 each side 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:50.449
 we will decorate it 

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:54.490
 trims rectangles smaller than the 

00:04:50.449 --> 00:04:54.490
 envelope to decorate the two sides 

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:10.290
 and now let's make it a medium 

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:12.990
 circular or at the top with a 

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:16.670
 drill or if you do not have the traces with 

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:16.670
 something circular and cut it out 

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:25.780
 to finish decorating it let's make it 

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:25.780
 a label where we will write 

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:32.939
 if you have can you help with stamps 

00:05:29.249 --> 00:05:34.619
 or you can make labels of this type and 

00:05:32.939 --> 00:05:37.699
 I'll leave them on the blog so that 

00:05:34.619 --> 00:05:37.699
 downloads if you want 

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:43.830
 then let's hit him a little 

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:47.120
 Plastic adhesive or counting and trimming 

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:47.120
 as many as you need 

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:50.770
 give in each envelope 

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:04.090
 the plastic is to be able to write and 

00:06:02.139 --> 00:06:06.000
 erase are for what we want to save 

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:09.710
 the money 

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.710
 now but not the cover 

00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:15.040
 and we are going to stick the strips in both 

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:17.139
 large rectangles matching 

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:20.320
 the spine of the envelopes with the rectangle 

00:06:17.139 --> 00:06:22.890
 thin leaving the margins on the sides 

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:22.890
 ah 

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:25.950
 ah 

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:35.069
 now it is to decorate the cover 

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:35.069
 to close it apply a little Velcro 

00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:46.710
 and if you want you can put some flower 

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:49.370
 of paper or something in the middle that's 

00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:49.370
 question of tastes 

00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:54.540
 and inside we're going to paste two 

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:57.650
 rectangles of paper to cover the 

00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:57.650
 union cardboard 

00:06:57.990 --> 00:07:02.729
 you only have to go putting your savings 

00:07:00.570 --> 00:07:05.960
 inside 

00:07:02.729 --> 00:07:05.960
 what do you think about the idea 

00:07:06.849 --> 00:07:10.869
 I hope you liked this 

00:07:08.409 --> 00:07:12.580
 craft and put it into practice 

00:07:10.869 --> 00:07:14.319
