00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:23.429 
which is pretty crazy to be honest so
yeah<00:01:22.240> we've<00:01:22.420> built<00:01:22.659> a<00:01:22.719> little<00:01:22.960> area<00:01:23.110> here

00:01:23.429 --> 00:01:23.439 
yeah we've built a little area here

00:01:23.439 --> 00:01:24.690 
yeah we've built a little area here
which<00:01:23.590> is<00:01:23.680> pretty<00:01:23.860> cool<00:01:23.979> I<00:01:24.100> think<00:01:24.219> we<00:01:24.369> can<00:01:24.520> jump

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:24.700 
which is pretty cool I think we can jump

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:26.039 
which is pretty cool I think we can jump
on<00:01:24.789> it<00:01:24.880> yeah<00:01:25.000> we<00:01:25.090> can<00:01:25.270> it's<00:01:25.420> like<00:01:25.539> stairs<00:01:25.899> as

00:01:26.039 --> 00:01:26.049 
on it yeah we can it's like stairs as

00:01:26.049 --> 00:01:27.990 
on it yeah we can it's like stairs as
you<00:01:26.110> can<00:01:26.289> see<00:01:26.439> it's<00:01:26.619> pretty<00:01:26.799> cool<00:01:27.189> and<00:01:27.460> yeah<00:01:27.850> if

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:28.000 
you can see it's pretty cool and yeah if

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.609 
you can see it's pretty cool and yeah if
we<00:01:28.090> press<00:01:28.299> o<00:01:28.450> on<00:01:28.509> the<00:01:28.780> wand<00:01:28.960> it<00:01:29.170> will<00:01:29.259> go<00:01:29.380> into

00:01:29.609 --> 00:01:29.619 
we press o on the wand it will go into

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:31.950 
we press o on the wand it will go into
rotate<00:01:30.610> mode<00:01:30.850> so<00:01:31.420> say<00:01:31.570> we<00:01:31.659> want<00:01:31.810> to<00:01:31.869> rotate

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:31.960 
rotate mode so say we want to rotate

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:33.959 
rotate mode so say we want to rotate
this<00:01:32.229> will<00:01:32.439> right<00:01:32.680> click<00:01:32.710> and<00:01:33.189> as<00:01:33.399> you<00:01:33.640> can<00:01:33.759> see

00:01:33.959 --> 00:01:33.969 
this will right click and as you can see

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:35.550 
this will right click and as you can see
it'll<00:01:34.180> rotate<00:01:34.329> but<00:01:34.689> let's<00:01:34.810> go<00:01:34.990> jump<00:01:35.170> down<00:01:35.350> here

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:35.560 
it'll rotate but let's go jump down here

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:38.819 
it'll rotate but let's go jump down here
and<00:01:35.680> do<00:01:35.740> it<00:01:35.799> on<00:01:35.890> the<00:01:35.979> king´s<00:01:36.189> chair<00:01:37.740> there<00:01:38.740> we

00:01:38.819 --> 00:01:38.829 
and do it on the king´s chair there we

00:01:38.829 --> 00:01:40.109 
and do it on the king´s chair there we
go<00:01:38.950> so<00:01:39.130> we<00:01:39.219> can<00:01:39.340> only<00:01:39.430> do<00:01:39.579> the<00:01:39.670> top<00:01:39.850> because<00:01:40.030> the

00:01:40.109 --> 00:01:40.119 
go so we can only do the top because the

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:41.940 
go so we can only do the top because the
bottom<00:01:40.359> it's<00:01:40.479> like<00:01:40.570> exactly<00:01:40.899> the<00:01:41.229> same<00:01:41.500> so

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:41.950 
bottom it's like exactly the same so

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:43.200 
bottom it's like exactly the same so
yeah<00:01:42.009> we're<00:01:42.130> gonna<00:01:42.280> rotate<00:01:42.430> the<00:01:42.700> top<00:01:42.850> and<00:01:43.090> as

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:43.210 
yeah we're gonna rotate the top and as

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:44.819 
yeah we're gonna rotate the top and as
you<00:01:43.270> can<00:01:43.420> see<00:01:43.539> we've<00:01:43.750> now<00:01:43.780> turned<00:01:44.020> the<00:01:44.560> king's

00:01:44.819 --> 00:01:44.829 
you can see we've now turned the king's

00:01:44.829 --> 00:01:47.219 
you can see we've now turned the king's
chair<00:01:45.490> or<00:01:45.789> the<00:01:45.850> Cal<00:01:46.210> suits<00:01:46.479> yet<00:01:46.630> the<00:01:46.930> other<00:01:47.049> way

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:47.229 
chair or the Cal suits yet the other way

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:48.719 
chair or the Cal suits yet the other way
around<00:01:47.320> so<00:01:47.649> we<00:01:47.710> don't<00:01:47.890> we<00:01:48.009> can<00:01:48.159> just<00:01:48.340> sit<00:01:48.549> here

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:48.729 
around so we don't we can just sit here

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:50.999 
around so we don't we can just sit here
like<00:01:49.479> badasses<00:01:50.020> on<00:01:50.469> top<00:01:50.679> of<00:01:50.770> the<00:01:50.829> church

00:01:50.999 --> 00:01:51.009 
like badasses on top of the church

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:53.880 
like badasses on top of the church
looking<00:01:51.579> like<00:01:52.179> this<00:01:52.390> and<00:01:52.750> then<00:01:53.140> we<00:01:53.200> can<00:01:53.350> but<00:01:53.799> I

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:53.890 
looking like this and then we can but I

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:55.020 
looking like this and then we can but I
don't<00:01:54.039> think<00:01:54.159> we<00:01:54.219> can<00:01:54.310> rotate<00:01:54.490> it<00:01:54.729> what<00:01:54.880> yeah

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:55.030 
don't think we can rotate it what yeah

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:56.249 
don't think we can rotate it what yeah
we<00:01:55.149> can<00:01:55.359> that's<00:01:55.570> pretty<00:01:55.719> cool<00:01:55.840> and<00:01:56.049> we'll

00:01:56.249 --> 00:01:56.259 
we can that's pretty cool and we'll

00:01:56.259 --> 00:01:57.840 
we can that's pretty cool and we'll

00:01:58.919 --> 00:01:58.929 
how it was so we can hit up with

00:01:58.929 --> 00:02:01.080 
how it was so we can hit up with
whatever<00:01:59.469> kind<00:01:59.859> of<00:01:59.950> stuff<00:02:00.159> is<00:02:00.460> a<00:02:00.490> little<00:02:00.789> block

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:36.700 
no I think we copied this bit so let's

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:37.979 
no I think we copied this bit so let's
go<00:02:36.819> try<00:02:37.000> and<00:02:37.090> copy<00:02:37.239> again<00:02:37.480> I<00:02:37.510> think<00:02:37.719> we<00:02:37.810> have<00:02:37.900> to

00:02:37.979 --> 00:02:37.989 
go try and copy again I think we have to

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:40.500 
go try and copy again I think we have to
write<00:02:38.170> try<00:02:38.469> this<00:02:38.530> right<00:02:39.459> click<00:02:39.760> I<00:02:40.060> think<00:02:40.450> I

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.510 
write try this right click I think I

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:42.119 
write try this right click I think I
might<00:02:40.659> work<00:02:40.810> and<00:02:41.079> we'll<00:02:41.379> see<00:02:41.530> if<00:02:41.590> it<00:02:41.709> work<00:02:41.920> if

00:02:42.119 --> 00:02:42.129 
might work and we'll see if it work if

00:02:42.129 --> 00:02:43.770 
might work and we'll see if it work if
not<00:02:42.189> we<00:02:42.489> might<00:02:42.639> have<00:02:42.730> to<00:02:42.849> you<00:02:43.209> know<00:02:43.299> switch<00:02:43.569> out

00:02:56.129 --> 00:02:56.139 
here we go copy mode see if we can try

00:02:56.139 --> 00:02:57.149 
here we go copy mode see if we can try
and<00:02:56.290> copy<00:02:56.439> it<00:02:56.590> if<00:02:56.650> there's<00:02:56.769> nothing<00:02:56.889> to<00:02:57.040> work

00:02:57.149 --> 00:02:57.159 
and copy it if there's nothing to work

00:02:57.159 --> 00:02:59.220 
and copy it if there's nothing to work
it's<00:02:57.370> gonna<00:02:57.489> be<00:02:57.639> there<00:02:58.450> we<00:02:58.629> go<00:02:58.750> it's<00:02:58.900> working

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:01.329 
now so now we can just got this even the

00:03:01.329 --> 00:03:02.819 
now so now we can just got this even the
whole<00:03:01.540> area<00:03:01.840> is<00:03:01.900> kind<00:03:02.049> of<00:03:02.139> a<00:03:02.230> mess<00:03:02.439> up<00:03:02.620> here

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:02.829 
whole area is kind of a mess up here

00:03:02.829 --> 00:03:04.860 
whole area is kind of a mess up here
which<00:03:02.980> is<00:03:03.159> kind<00:03:03.340> of<00:03:03.400> a<00:03:03.489> shame<00:03:03.700> maybe<00:03:03.970> if<00:03:04.090> we<00:03:04.239> get

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:04.870 
which is kind of a shame maybe if we get

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:06.390 
which is kind of a shame maybe if we get
like<00:03:04.989> a<00:03:05.019> cobblestone<00:03:05.409> block<00:03:05.769> here<00:03:06.040> and<00:03:06.069> then

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:06.400 
like a cobblestone block here and then

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.640 
like a cobblestone block here and then
we<00:03:06.519> place<00:03:06.730> it<00:03:06.909> here<00:03:07.120> there<00:03:07.719> we<00:03:07.930> go

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:08.650

fix a so next off we're gonna press o
again<00:03:16.629> and<00:03:16.900> what<00:03:17.079> its<00:03:17.260> gonna<00:03:17.319> do<00:03:17.560> is<00:03:17.739> put<00:03:17.950> the

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:18.040 
again and what its gonna do is put the

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:20.490 
again and what its gonna do is put the
little<00:03:18.189> wand<00:03:19.060> in<00:03:19.329> Destroy<00:03:19.840> mode<00:03:20.049> and<00:03:20.379> I<00:03:20.439> don't

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:20.500 
little wand in Destroy mode and I don't

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:21.959 
little wand in Destroy mode and I don't
honestly<00:03:20.950> know<00:03:21.189> what<00:03:21.430> that<00:03:21.549> does<00:03:21.700> and<00:03:21.849> I<00:03:21.909> know

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:21.969 
honestly know what that does and I know

00:03:21.969 --> 00:03:23.640 
honestly know what that does and I know
it<00:03:22.120> seems<00:03:22.299> to<00:03:22.419> work<00:03:22.450> when<00:03:22.719> I<00:03:22.750> hit<00:03:22.930> click<00:03:23.409> but<00:03:23.620> I

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:23.650 
it seems to work when I hit click but I

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:25.199 
it seems to work when I hit click but I
would<00:03:23.859> assume<00:03:24.069> it<00:03:24.340> basically<00:03:24.849> destroys

00:03:25.199 --> 00:03:25.209 
would assume it basically destroys

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:27.270 
would assume it basically destroys
little<00:03:25.840> blocks<00:03:26.049> much<00:03:26.260> more<00:03:26.560> that's<00:03:26.829> faster

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:27.280 
little blocks much more that's faster

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:28.710 
little blocks much more that's faster
than<00:03:27.430> the<00:03:27.519> normal<00:03:27.609> blocks<00:03:27.970> so<00:03:28.449> now<00:03:28.569> we're

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:28.720 
than the normal blocks so now we're

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:30.539 
than the normal blocks so now we're
getting<00:03:28.780> pressing<00:03:29.139> oh<00:03:29.260> one<00:03:29.680> more<00:03:29.799> time<00:03:30.010> and

00:03:30.539 --> 00:03:30.549 
getting pressing oh one more time and

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:32.039 
getting pressing oh one more time and
we're<00:03:30.699> gonna<00:03:30.790> get<00:03:31.000> the<00:03:31.269> place<00:03:31.479> mode<00:03:31.810> that's

00:03:32.039 --> 00:03:32.049 
we're gonna get the place mode that's

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:33.420 
we're gonna get the place mode that's
the<00:03:32.229> main<00:03:32.530> mode<00:03:32.769> which<00:03:32.949> was<00:03:33.069> just<00:03:33.220> done<00:03:33.400> a

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:33.430 
the main mode which was just done a

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:35.339 
the main mode which was just done a
little<00:03:33.639> bit<00:03:33.790> and<00:03:34.090> we<00:03:34.209> can<00:03:34.329> place<00:03:34.540> it<00:03:34.840> will<00:03:35.079> kind

00:03:35.339 --> 00:03:35.349 
little bit and we can place it will kind

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:36.509 
little bit and we can place it will kind
of<00:03:35.409> give<00:03:35.560> us<00:03:35.680> a<00:03:35.769> region<00:03:36.040> where<00:03:36.129> we<00:03:36.220> can<00:03:36.370> place

00:03:36.509 --> 00:03:36.519 
of give us a region where we can place

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:39.360 
of give us a region where we can place
blocks<00:03:36.699> so<00:03:37.479> let's<00:03:37.629> make<00:03:37.810> a<00:03:37.989> dough<00:03:38.889> guys<00:03:39.189> we're
