00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:03.240
 hello to all we will you 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:07.849
 present 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:12.450
 django cms so this is a tool that 

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:15.089
 allows our customers to manage 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:19.650
 update delete add from 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:21.270
 content on their website 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.039
 here it is a very practical tool 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:26.279
 since it allows to manage both the 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:27.230
 text the picture the video and a lot 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:32.430
 other things 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:34.829
 so we wanted to leave for 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:38.820
 this demonstration is well of our 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:42.690
 website we created for that 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:46.370
 a demo page that we 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:52.440
 let's go right away and see 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:56.940
 browse this is the page 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:59.100
 demonstration of django cns so 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.410
 the interest of our tool is that it 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.719
 allows and at the same time both 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:08.420
 to update misinformation 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:10.939
 live on a page for example here 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:13.490
 so just click on the small 

00:01:10.939 --> 00:01:16.460
 more so that a bar appears 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:19.130
 django tools cms here we have the choice 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:20.530
 to go into edit mode or not so there 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:24.229
 currently in off mode 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:27.110
 if we put our edition here we see 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:29.119
 that on the page appears a second 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:31.000
 toolbar that helps manage the 

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:33.470
 content as indicated 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.729
 each content can be split into 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:38.630
 several blocks so here we have two blocks 

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:41.240
 imagine that we wanted to add some 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:44.750
 text here as the phrase demonstration 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:47.000
 Monday we click on the little pen and 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:51.310
 there a new window opens for 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:02:02.060
 can edit this information 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:02:04.850
 actually this one saves and 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:07.209
 like magic phrase that has just 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:09.410
 add just add 

00:02:07.209 --> 00:02:11.540
 actually on the site page so 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:14.600
 the meadow is rather simple there is 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:16.239
 no problem same time now 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:18.890
 we will add an image 

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:20.750
 so we have two solutions either we do 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:23.000
 as we saw earlier with the 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:25.870
 little pen you can redeem an image to 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.870
 inside a block 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:35.780
 here we can make block available image 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:38.250
 threw a block so the tool 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:41.520
 of directors interprets that 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:43.610
 by opening a new window it 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:46.020
 must then look for an image 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:48.570
 so the administration tool allow 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:49.950
 gm image library so we can 

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:53.720
 go get one that is already 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:56.459
 present inside our site 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:59.390
 here we go I do not know by 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:59.390
 example look for an image 

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:12.310
 take our logo so the logo has been 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:15.160
 loaded one records and so there the image 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:18.100
 seamlessly integrates with recording and 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:20.160
 we will see the result on the page of the 

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:23.740
 website the public page 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:25.330
 and so that's the images is integrated or 

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:26.980
 of course there I spent every 

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:29.650
 details but we can set the image 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:32.050
 resize it add text 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:34.870
 alternative so that the engines of 

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:37.090
 research gets to identify the image 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:39.700
 since search engines do not 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:41.050
 do not necessarily take into account 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:43.780
 pictures which have no tests 

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:46.030
 alternative and here I go so 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:49.620
 a lot of details but in any case 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:52.240
 we still saw it in the space of 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:54.360
 two minutes that we could add some 

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:56.830
 text and image without any problem 

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:58.660
 so that's really the functionality 

00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:00.460
 very interesting django cms she 

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:03.540
 allows you to edit the content 

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:06.690
 directly from the public page 

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:08.980
 we will say without much effort 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:10.240
 after we have the opportunity to have a 

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:14.740
 much more admin console 

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:16.150
 detailed here is that it's really the 

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:18.370
 what therefore appears in what we 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:22.470
 call the back office of the website 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:26.830
 so that all our customers they have access 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:28.000
 despite everything it's true that advice 

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:31.090
 of directors as it is 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.410
 presented here it probably deserves 

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:33.730
 customization every time in 

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:36.160
 function of each client so that's 

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:38.230
 really according to what is worth 

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:42.490
 each customer or according to the packs 

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:43.600
 web who leave it franchise but 

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:44.680
 generally there is always a 

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:46.560
 customization board 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:48.640
 which allows you to have a 

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:52.720
 navigation a little simpler for the 

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:57.040
 climate so here we can add some 

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:59.470
 pages we can manage the pages add 

00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:01.570
 pages change them so if we click 

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:02.890
 on the pages well there we can see any 

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:07.150
 the page tree our site 

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:09.870
 internet and so we find the page of 

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:12.430
 test here demonstration of django cns 

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:14.340
 knowing that a test page we have not 

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:17.140
 no attempt to integrate so 

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:20.020
 perennial for the moment when internet but 

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:21.160
 if we look at the tree of our 

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:23.740
 site and that it is known by the NGO 

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:25.870
 I had been long- standing between you and 

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:27.070
 well there we can see all the numbers 

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:29.410
 in all pages all 

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:30.510
 the really logical tree we have 

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:33.190
 on our website 

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:35.590
 and if you work with you well 

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:37.330
 Anyway you will not choose you 

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:40.620
 will also have a tree structure that 

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:41.669
 will be very hierarchical and very logical 

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:44.880
 when you are very much in line with others 

00:05:41.669 --> 00:05:46.320
 internet sites then there what can be there 

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:50.340
 to see is that we can quite 

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:52.830
 change the order of appearance of the pages 

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:55.320
 or groups of pages if we decide that 

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:56.669
 martic web marketing and well must 

00:05:55.320 --> 00:06:01.050
 appear before website 

00:05:56.669 --> 00:06:05.070
 no problem just change from 

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:06.300
 move the top of the page and there you 

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:09.720
 see their web keating now and 

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:11.250
 now before website so here 

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:12.690
 that's an example so we're going to 

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:14.820
 put as was at the beginning 

00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:20.720
 since it was still 

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:20.720
 thoughtful here 

00:06:22.289 --> 00:06:26.279
 and what can we show you 

00:06:23.729 --> 00:06:30.830
 others a lot of things but small 

00:06:26.279 --> 00:06:30.830
 stop there this first time
