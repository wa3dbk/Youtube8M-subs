points about this car ready I suppose it

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:31.350 
points about this car ready I suppose it
is<00:02:29.600> quite<00:02:29.870> quiet<00:02:30.230> once<00:02:30.470> you're<00:02:30.650> in<00:02:30.740> the<00:02:30.830> cab

is quite quiet once you're in the cab

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:33.670 
is quite quiet once you're in the cab
and<00:02:32.360> it<00:02:32.570> seems<00:02:32.780> to<00:02:32.930> go<00:02:33.020> around<00:02:33.230> the<00:02:33.290> corners

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:33.680 
and it seems to go around the corners

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:37.330 
and it seems to go around the corners
quite<00:02:33.920> well<00:02:34.130> for<00:02:34.430> a<00:02:34.540> big<00:02:35.540> car<00:02:35.900> but<00:02:36.470> to<00:02:36.920> be<00:02:37.070> fair

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:37.340
