pokémon y countdown video now that the
big<00:00:04.020> news<00:00:04.200> of<00:00:04.380> mega<00:00:04.560> evolutions<00:00:05.100> are<00:00:05.250> behind

00:00:05.539 --> 00:00:05.549 
big news of mega evolutions are behind

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:07.039 
big news of mega evolutions are behind
us<00:00:05.670> we<00:00:05.819> can<00:00:05.940> actually<00:00:06.150> take<00:00:06.540> a<00:00:06.569> look<00:00:06.779> at<00:00:06.899> some

00:00:07.039 --> 00:00:07.049 
us we can actually take a look at some

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:09.080 
us we can actually take a look at some
fan-made<00:00:07.319> mega<00:00:07.740> evolutions<00:00:08.429> let's<00:00:08.910> take<00:00:09.059> a

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.090 
fan-made mega evolutions let's take a

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:10.400 
fan-made mega evolutions let's take a
look<00:00:09.300> at<00:00:09.360> this<00:00:09.450> cough<00:00:09.690> Rodriguez<00:00:10.200> mega

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.410 
look at this cough Rodriguez mega

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:12.470 
look at this cough Rodriguez mega
evolution<00:00:11.040> cough<00:00:11.580> egregious<00:00:12.059> comes<00:00:12.269> out<00:00:12.389> of

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
evolution cough egregious comes out of

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:13.910 
evolution cough egregious comes out of
the<00:00:12.540> coffin<00:00:12.809> he<00:00:13.170> doesn't<00:00:13.440> look<00:00:13.559> that<00:00:13.620> much

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
the coffin he doesn't look that much

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.460 
the coffin he doesn't look that much
more<00:00:14.160> menacing<00:00:14.480> but<00:00:15.480> he<00:00:15.809> did<00:00:16.020> come<00:00:16.199> out<00:00:16.289> of<00:00:16.410> the

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
more menacing but he did come out of the

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.070 
more menacing but he did come out of the
coughing<00:00:16.890> so<00:00:17.190> he<00:00:17.760> probably<00:00:18.060> has<00:00:18.390> more<00:00:18.420> speed

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
coughing so he probably has more speed

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.290 
coughing so he probably has more speed
and<00:00:19.380> you<00:00:20.010> know<00:00:20.160> mega<00:00:20.430> evolutions<00:00:20.910> are<00:00:21.000> about

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
and you know mega evolutions are about

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.660 
and you know mega evolutions are about
that<00:00:21.539> stat<00:00:21.900> change<00:00:22.260> so<00:00:22.619> that's<00:00:23.310> really

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
that stat change so that's really

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.070 
that stat change so that's really
fitting<00:00:24.060> for<00:00:24.210> a<00:00:24.240> cough<00:00:24.420> egregious<00:00:24.840> mega

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
fitting for a cough egregious mega

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.769 
fitting for a cough egregious mega
evolution<00:00:25.650> and<00:00:26.090> this<00:00:27.090> next<00:00:27.330> one<00:00:27.420> we<00:00:27.630> see<00:00:27.750> a

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
evolution and this next one we see a

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:29.660 
evolution and this next one we see a
chan<00:00:28.050> to<00:00:28.140> lure<00:00:28.289> mega<00:00:28.590> evolution<00:00:29.189> and<00:00:29.369> the<00:00:29.490> mega

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
chan to lure mega evolution and the mega

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:30.800 
chan to lure mega evolution and the mega
evolution<00:00:29.760> looks<00:00:30.420> like<00:00:30.570> it<00:00:30.689> would<00:00:30.750> probably

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
evolution looks like it would probably

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.080 
evolution looks like it would probably
have<00:00:31.320> more<00:00:31.529> attack<00:00:31.890> more<00:00:32.189> special<00:00:32.730> attack<00:00:33.059> I

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
have more attack more special attack I

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.060 
have more attack more special attack I
mean<00:00:33.329> more<00:00:33.600> flames<00:00:33.989> it's<00:00:34.649> a<00:00:34.710> little<00:00:34.950> bit

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
mean more flames it's a little bit

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:36.799 
mean more flames it's a little bit
bigger<00:00:35.370> it<00:00:35.670> looks<00:00:35.880> like<00:00:36.300> something<00:00:36.630> Game

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
bigger it looks like something Game

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.049 
bigger it looks like something Game
Freak<00:00:36.960> would<00:00:37.200> do<00:00:37.380> so<00:00:37.680> that's<00:00:38.309> crazy<00:00:38.730> I<00:00:38.879> mean

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
Freak would do so that's crazy I mean

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:40.940 
Freak would do so that's crazy I mean
the<00:00:39.210> artist<00:00:39.629> actually<00:00:39.870> put<00:00:40.410> some<00:00:40.590> work<00:00:40.770> in

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
the artist actually put some work in

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.720 
the artist actually put some work in
this<00:00:41.129> and<00:00:41.370> it's<00:00:41.820> really<00:00:42.090> realistic<00:00:43.340> now<00:00:44.340> about

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
this and it's really realistic now about

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.049 
this and it's really realistic now about
this<00:00:45.090> fan<00:00:45.600> made<00:00:45.960> Conkeldurr<00:00:46.860> mega<00:00:47.370> evolution

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
this fan made Conkeldurr mega evolution

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.029 
this fan made Conkeldurr mega evolution
I'm<00:00:48.210> not<00:00:48.360> really<00:00:48.539> feeling<00:00:49.020> it<00:00:49.110> I<00:00:49.230> mean<00:00:49.350> the<00:00:49.530> the

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
I'm not really feeling it I mean the the

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:51.590 
I'm not really feeling it I mean the the
beard<00:00:50.370> and<00:00:50.610> the<00:00:50.670> hair<00:00:50.700> it's<00:00:51.239> kind<00:00:51.539> of

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
beard and the hair it's kind of

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.770 
beard and the hair it's kind of
unnecessary<00:00:51.899> the<00:00:52.469> no<00:00:52.680> shrunk<00:00:53.250> like<00:00:53.940> I<00:00:54.210> mean<00:00:54.449> he

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
unnecessary the no shrunk like I mean he

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.540 
unnecessary the no shrunk like I mean he
looks<00:00:55.050> like<00:00:55.260> it<00:00:55.920> just<00:00:55.980> looks<00:00:56.309> like<00:00:56.430> a

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
looks like it just looks like a

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.349 
looks like it just looks like a
different<00:00:57.000> form<00:00:57.329> I<00:00:57.600> don't<00:00:57.660> know<00:00:58.340> the<00:00:59.359> rock

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
different form I don't know the rock

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:04.000 
different form I don't know the rock
arms<00:01:01.050> and<00:01:01.350> hands<00:01:02.280> I<00:01:02.489> probably<00:01:03.239> wouldn't<00:01:03.780> be

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:04.010 
arms and hands I probably wouldn't be

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:06.950 
arms and hands I probably wouldn't be
any<00:01:05.010> good<00:01:05.129> to<00:01:05.640> Conkeldurr<00:01:06.330> as<00:01:06.659> a<00:01:06.689> mega

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
any good to Conkeldurr as a mega

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.550 
any good to Conkeldurr as a mega
evolution<00:01:07.100> like<00:01:08.100> the<00:01:08.310> tie<00:01:08.520> is<00:01:08.600> unnecessary<00:01:09.600> I

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
evolution like the tie is unnecessary I

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.550 
evolution like the tie is unnecessary I
like<00:01:11.159> the<00:01:11.280> art<00:01:11.490> yeah<00:01:11.850> but<00:01:11.880> I<00:01:12.450> don't<00:01:12.750> see<00:01:13.080> how

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
like the art yeah but I don't see how

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.219 
like the art yeah but I don't see how
this<00:01:13.920> would<00:01:14.460> benefit<00:01:15.030> Conkeldurr<00:01:15.570> as<00:01:15.900> a<00:01:15.930> mega

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
this would benefit Conkeldurr as a mega

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.920 
this would benefit Conkeldurr as a mega
evolution<00:01:16.890> so<00:01:17.580> I<00:01:18.030> mean<00:01:18.240> I'm<00:01:18.479> gonna<00:01:18.600> have<00:01:18.780> to

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
evolution so I mean I'm gonna have to

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.109 
evolution so I mean I'm gonna have to
maybe<00:01:19.409> this<00:01:19.650> one<00:01:19.890> it's<00:01:20.070> not<00:01:20.100> that<00:01:20.549> great<00:01:20.790> ok

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
maybe this one it's not that great ok

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.410 
maybe this one it's not that great ok
let's<00:01:21.330> just<00:01:21.450> move<00:01:21.600> on<00:01:21.750> to<00:01:21.900> the<00:01:22.020> next<00:01:22.200> one

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:23.420 
let's just move on to the next one

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:25.850 
let's just move on to the next one
finally<00:01:24.420> we<00:01:24.750> have<00:01:24.869> a<00:01:24.900> Feraligatr<00:01:25.290> mega

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
finally we have a Feraligatr mega

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.649 
finally we have a Feraligatr mega
evolution<00:01:26.460> and<00:01:26.610> if<00:01:26.700> Blaziken<00:01:27.210> had<00:01:27.360> a<00:01:27.390> mega

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
evolution and if Blaziken had a mega

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.450 
evolution and if Blaziken had a mega
evolution<00:01:27.750> then<00:01:28.710> I<00:01:28.950> don't<00:01:29.130> see<00:01:29.280> what

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
evolution then I don't see what

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.390 
evolution then I don't see what
Feraligatr<00:01:29.700> can't<00:01:30.329> have<00:01:30.509> one<00:01:30.720> too<00:01:30.930> so<00:01:31.740> and<00:01:32.159> for

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
Feraligatr can't have one too so and for

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.190 
Feraligatr can't have one too so and for
alligator's<00:01:32.850> mega<00:01:33.090> evolution<00:01:33.689> he<00:01:33.780> has<00:01:33.930> like

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
alligator's mega evolution he has like

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.490 
alligator's mega evolution he has like
glass<00:01:34.619> coming<00:01:35.100> out<00:01:35.310> of<00:01:35.430> his<00:01:35.579> arms<00:01:35.909> and<00:01:36.119> legs

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:36.500 
glass coming out of his arms and legs

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:39.530 
glass coming out of his arms and legs
it's<00:01:37.500> kind<00:01:37.740> of<00:01:37.799> like<00:01:37.950> spikes<00:01:38.460> more<00:01:39.000> than<00:01:39.180> glass

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
it's kind of like spikes more than glass

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.390 
it's kind of like spikes more than glass
but<00:01:40.110> it<00:01:40.229> looks<00:01:40.380> like<00:01:40.470> glass<00:01:40.799> and<00:01:41.100> in<00:01:41.220> his

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
but it looks like glass and in his

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.039 
but it looks like glass and in his
shoulder<00:01:41.759> he<00:01:41.880> has<00:01:41.970> some<00:01:42.180> type<00:01:42.360> of<00:01:42.390> wing<00:01:42.780> thing

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
shoulder he has some type of wing thing
