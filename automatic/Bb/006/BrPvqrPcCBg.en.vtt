00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:53.840 
MJ rig is key you don't want it rolling

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:56.140 
MJ rig is key you don't want it rolling
on<00:01:53.990> you<00:01:54.170> and<00:01:54.470> having<00:01:54.920> some<00:01:55.100> line<00:01:55.310> twists<00:01:55.610> so

again I've got it nice and straight I'm

00:01:57.470 --> 00:01:58.600 
again I've got it nice and straight I'm
going<00:01:57.590> to<00:01:57.650> pitch<00:01:57.830> it<00:01:57.950> back<00:01:58.130> in<00:01:58.310> the<00:01:58.400> top

00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:58.610 
going to pitch it back in the top

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:00.550 
going to pitch it back in the top
because<00:01:59.240> it<00:01:59.570> is<00:01:59.600> going<00:02:00.020> to<00:02:00.110> be<00:02:00.200> something<00:02:00.530> that

because it is going to be something that
you're<00:02:00.740> going<00:02:00.830> to<00:02:00.890> fish<00:02:01.100> around<00:02:01.310> some<00:02:01.549> grass

00:02:01.749 --> 00:02:01.759 
you're going to fish around some grass

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:03.789 
you're going to fish around some grass
from<00:02:02.450> there<00:02:02.600> what<00:02:02.780> I've<00:02:02.930> found<00:02:03.140> in<00:02:03.380> terms<00:02:03.560> of<00:02:03.710> a

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:03.799 
from there what I've found in terms of a

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:05.710 
from there what I've found in terms of a
weight<00:02:04.040> I<00:02:04.340> find<00:02:04.759> a<00:02:04.850> boat<00:02:05.000> you'll<00:02:05.210> be<00:02:05.329> surprised

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:05.720 
weight I find a boat you'll be surprised

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:07.390 
weight I find a boat you'll be surprised
how<00:02:05.840> heavy<00:02:06.170> it<00:02:06.320> actually<00:02:06.710> is<00:02:06.829> with<00:02:07.009> that<00:02:07.159> blade

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:07.400 
how heavy it actually is with that blade

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:09.729 
how heavy it actually is with that blade
at<00:02:07.640> the<00:02:07.729> back<00:02:07.939> a<00:02:08.209> quarter<00:02:08.929> ounce<00:02:09.140> weight<00:02:09.409> for

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:09.739 
at the back a quarter ounce weight for

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:11.140 
at the back a quarter ounce weight for
me<00:02:09.890> has<00:02:10.039> been<00:02:10.159> working<00:02:10.549> great<00:02:10.789> because<00:02:11.060> I've

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:11.150 
me has been working great because I've

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:12.460 
me has been working great because I've
been<00:02:11.239> using<00:02:11.450> it<00:02:11.629> around<00:02:11.840> some<00:02:12.049> more<00:02:12.170> scattered

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:12.470 
been using it around some more scattered

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:14.710 
been using it around some more scattered
grass<00:02:12.890> but<00:02:13.519> if<00:02:13.610> you're<00:02:13.760> in<00:02:13.849> thicker<00:02:14.180> weeds<00:02:14.480> or

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:14.720 
grass but if you're in thicker weeds or

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:16.600 
grass but if you're in thicker weeds or
thicker<00:02:14.959> grass<00:02:15.290> definitely<00:02:16.280> go<00:02:16.430> with<00:02:16.550> a

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610 
thicker grass definitely go with a

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:18.280 
thicker grass definitely go with a
heavier<00:02:16.970> weight<00:02:17.150> what<00:02:17.750> I've<00:02:17.870> done<00:02:17.989> I've<00:02:18.140> also

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290 
heavier weight what I've done I've also

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:19.720 
heavier weight what I've done I've also
pegged<00:02:18.739> this<00:02:18.950> weight<00:02:19.160> so<00:02:19.190> I've

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:19.730 
pegged this weight so I've

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:21.610 
pegged this weight so I've
used<00:02:19.849> a<00:02:20.000> toothpick<00:02:20.599> again<00:02:20.900> it's<00:02:21.200> pegged<00:02:21.440> down

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 
used a toothpick again it's pegged down

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:24.430 
used a toothpick again it's pegged down
so<00:02:22.129> I've<00:02:22.190> got<00:02:22.310> a<00:02:22.340> nice<00:02:22.640> straight<00:02:23.269> MJ<00:02:23.870> rig<00:02:24.140> here

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:24.440 
so I've got a nice straight MJ rig here

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:25.869 
so I've got a nice straight MJ rig here
the<00:02:25.040> way<00:02:25.159> you're<00:02:25.280> going<00:02:25.400> to<00:02:25.459> use<00:02:25.670> it<00:02:25.790> you're

00:02:25.869 --> 00:02:25.879 
the way you're going to use it you're

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:27.550 
the way you're going to use it you're
going<00:02:25.940> to<00:02:26.060> cast<00:02:26.360> it<00:02:26.599> out<00:02:26.659> and<00:02:26.900> let<00:02:27.049> it<00:02:27.080> really

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560 
going to cast it out and let it really

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:29.710 
going to cast it out and let it really
sink<00:02:27.799> down<00:02:28.250> to<00:02:28.459> the<00:02:28.549> bottom<00:02:28.640> of<00:02:29.000> the<00:02:29.120> grass

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:29.720 
sink down to the bottom of the grass

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:31.270 
sink down to the bottom of the grass
there<00:02:30.019> so<00:02:30.230> from<00:02:30.709> there<00:02:30.799> you're<00:02:30.890> going<00:02:30.920> to<00:02:31.040> work

the grass it's going to come through

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:36.400 
the grass it's going to come through
nice<00:02:34.519> and<00:02:34.549> clean<00:02:35.000> you're<00:02:35.720> giving<00:02:36.049> the<00:02:36.140> fish<00:02:36.379> a

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:36.410 
nice and clean you're giving the fish a

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:37.990 
nice and clean you're giving the fish a
slightly<00:02:36.920> different<00:02:37.489> look<00:02:37.670> than<00:02:37.819> they've

slightly different look than they've
seen<00:02:38.299> it's<00:02:38.930> always<00:02:39.230> going<00:02:39.319> to<00:02:39.379> get<00:02:39.530> a<00:02:39.590> slightly

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.040 
seen it's always going to get a slightly

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:42.009 
seen it's always going to get a slightly
bigger<00:02:40.430> bite<00:02:40.730> that<00:02:40.940> I<00:02:41.000> found<00:02:41.390> so<00:02:41.599> again<00:02:41.840> next
