the way we drive sports cars the Porsche
918<00:03:00.700> Spyder<00:03:01.420> is<00:03:01.690> one<00:03:02.320> of<00:03:02.440> our<00:03:02.530> answers<00:03:03.040> to

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:03.310 
918 Spyder is one of our answers to

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:06.510 
918 Spyder is one of our answers to
urgent<00:03:03.790> environmental<00:03:04.570> issues<00:03:04.900> and<00:03:05.200> yes<00:03:05.950> we

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:06.520 
urgent environmental issues and yes we

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:09.570 
urgent environmental issues and yes we
respond<00:03:07.090> with<00:03:07.210> higher<00:03:07.570> power<00:03:07.960> but<00:03:08.560> also<00:03:08.800> with

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:09.580 
respond with higher power but also with

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:12.660 
respond with higher power but also with
lower<00:03:09.940> fuel<00:03:10.330> consumption<00:03:10.950> the<00:03:11.950> contradiction

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:12.670 
lower fuel consumption the contradiction

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:15.860 
lower fuel consumption the contradiction
not<00:03:13.240> at<00:03:13.360> all<00:03:13.560> it's<00:03:14.560> the<00:03:14.740> principle<00:03:15.310> we<00:03:15.460> call

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870 
not at all it's the principle we call

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:20.610 
not at all it's the principle we call
Porsche<00:03:16.890> intelligent<00:03:17.890> performance
