running<00:03:22.239> out<00:03:22.480> of<00:03:22.510> ammo<00:03:22.900> because<00:03:23.349> apparently

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:23.920 
running out of ammo because apparently

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:28.350 
running out of ammo because apparently

00:03:30.899 --> 00:03:30.909 
ammo so maybe if I can just jump over

00:03:30.909 --> 00:03:33.570 
ammo so maybe if I can just jump over
them<00:03:31.269> I<00:03:31.299> should<00:03:31.599> do<00:03:31.840> that<00:03:32.049> there<00:03:32.590> you<00:03:32.709> go<00:03:32.860> but

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:33.580 
them I should do that there you go but

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:35.820 
them I should do that there you go but
weirder<00:03:34.000> when<00:03:34.360> there's<00:03:34.659> an<00:03:34.840> actual<00:03:35.080> line<00:03:35.620> of

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:35.830 
weirder when there's an actual line of

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:38.850 
weirder when there's an actual line of
the<00:03:36.190> zombies<00:03:36.730> in<00:03:37.540> front<00:03:37.810> of<00:03:37.870> me<00:03:37.989> then<00:03:38.290> I<00:03:38.319> can

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:38.860 
the zombies in front of me then I can

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:40.860 
the zombies in front of me then I can
shoot<00:03:39.069> them<00:03:39.310> like<00:03:39.519> this<00:03:39.640> to<00:03:39.879> talk<00:03:40.150> to<00:03:40.299> you<00:03:40.480> I
