00:00:10.839 --> 00:00:15.110
 hello friends how are you again 

00:00:13.429 --> 00:00:17.210
 receive here in my office I am the 

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:19.520
 nutriologa mariana garcia is here very 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:22.310
 glad to have them with me again 

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:25.220
 and today we are going to have a theme 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:27.470
 that we are going to talk and I know that they are going 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:30.080
 to be very interested because it's like 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:32.660
 eat breakfast and sin intelligently 

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:34.580
 when we go out on weekends this 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:37.430
 It's a subject that sometimes makes you 

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:39.380
 we understand well we arrived at the buffet and 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:40.790
 We go to a restaurant and we ask or 

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:43.430
 we eat everything he puts in front of us 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:45.770
 because it is our free day true and 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:48.560
 we can somehow take care of these 

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:50.960
 breakfast without having to leave the 

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:53.720
 all of our food plan and eat 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:55.850
 in a much healthier way and 

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:58.040
 give us those little sins so it's good 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:59.390
 Well let's start and I hope that you 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:01.760
 like, do not leave 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:03.920
 well then to enter what always 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:04.730
 we can find in the breakfasts are 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:06.440
 juices 

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:08.840
 and there are times that either the 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:10.460
 let's ask the waiter or find them as 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:12.530
 I tell you in the buffet we are going to 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:14.750
 find now the fashion of juice 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:16.550
 green and we 're going to see it there nice 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:18.650
 ready to be served or so that 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:20.210
 we serve ourselves but I do not know if 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:23.240
 you have noticed that these juices 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:25.940
 entry greens are super sugary 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:27.620
 It's not like they have a fruit 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:30.020
 person as I always tell you if 

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:32.780
 they do not have many many fruits anymore 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:35.030
 better two or three vegetables 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:37.310
 Even the nopal is always true because 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:39.410
 is the fashion of the cactus or in a moment 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:41.570
 given has also parsley and indeed 

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:43.490
 until he does not know but well they wanted 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:45.530
 also rectify with you that when 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:47.810
 go to a better restaurant do not ask for the 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:49.160
 green juice the green juice that goes there 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:50.960
 to offer will be very high in 

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:52.880
 sugars and it's much better than what 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:54.920
 we consume at home at a given time 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:57.890
 better let's ask as a first time 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:00.230
 either a cup of minus one cup of 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:02.150
 papaya and we accompany it with a little 

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:04.310
 cottage cheese this way we're going to 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:06.200
 have the carbohydrate and the protein and not 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:08.420
 is going to enter then then very quickly these 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:10.250
 sugars in our blood another option 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:10.920
 that later we can ask as a second 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:13.620
 plate 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:16.349
 to eggs to taste or maybe hot cakes 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:18.840
 or maybe enchiladas that all this 

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:21.030
 good sounds delicious but if I suggest 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:23.550
 count how many carbohydrates and 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:26.220
 they will be consuming breakfast 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:28.770
 the ideal is not to go over 2 if I already 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:30.810
 I ate fruit and I ate a carbohydrate and 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:35.370
 in the second time we can to the best 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:37.470
 consume an egg I do not know this rancher 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:39.420
 true that they put the tortilla down 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:41.489
 put the egg and on top the sauce 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:43.080
 Normally they are going to give us two eggs like that 

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:45.600
 is that I would suggest that only 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:47.700
 eat an omelet and eat both 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:50.040
 eggs apart this way we're going to 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:52.140
 have the omelette and the papaya as 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:54.630
 carbohydrate and it's going to be balanced with 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:56.910
 the cottage cheese the protein and with the 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:59.730
 egg that would also be your protein 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:01.890
 now what would happen if I in addition to this 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:04.019
 I want to eat maybe for dessert 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:05.880
 true then they put us there then 

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:08.310
 then the candy bread basket or if 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:10.319
 I suggest you do not eat before any 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:12.480
 thing with coffee the sweet bread keep 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:13.500
 what for the end of breakfast to the best 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:15.870
 in one of those are no longer so 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:18.690
 hungry and do not eat everything the donut 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:20.129
 and if we eat it at the beginning it is 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:21.959
 the sugar as it is going to enter 

00:03:20.129 --> 00:03:23.970
 our body so we keep the 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:25.500
 for the end and if I already started 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:27.060
 the carbohydrates well this one is going to 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:29.190
 be maybe my little bit of this 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:30.930
 food because if I tell you that a 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:33.000
 donate as well as such see is more or less 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:34.620
 of the size a little bit smaller from my hand 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:38.159
 my hand is small but well there they see it 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:40.409
 It has 2 carbohydrates and very many 

00:03:38.159 --> 00:03:42.060
 sugars so is that if I suggest anything 

00:03:40.409 --> 00:03:43.950
 more that they take care of this to the best 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:46.049
 share it with someone else that is nothing 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:48.780
 more half of the donut or in a moment 

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:51.209
 given not to eat the tortilla and beware 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:54.269
 that sugar or that carbohydrate for 

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:56.310
 after breakfast not if we 

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:58.140
 we eat maybe a few hot cakes 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:00.359
 two or three hot cakes that we sometimes make 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:02.549
 Well, if I suggest you do not eat 

00:04:00.359 --> 00:04:04.680
 that donate because there it leads to be a 

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:07.950
 excessive load and we're going to be 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:09.959
 sinning with intelligence this if you 

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:12.569
 maybe they have breakfast at home and they want 

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:14.340
 eating is nice as an extra as there is 

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:16.410
 many options that can consume 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:18.239
 eggs to taste eggs with nopales 

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:20.489
 eggs with pumpkins or make one 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:22.680
 quesadilla with oaxaca cheese and ham 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:26.160
 of turkey and eat like 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:29.430
 that area half shell or in a moment 

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:31.800
 given maybe this one I do not know a jockey that 

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:34.830
 would be the best that pop but if you take care 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:37.380
 Above all do not abuse and do not consume loads 

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:39.240
 excessive carbohydrates from flours 

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:41.610
 fruits because far from being sinning 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:43.530
 smart we are going to be sinning in 

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:45.810
 too much and that carbohydrate you 

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:48.720
 remember that if you do not use it as 

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:51.870
 fat as energy for exercise 

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:53.820
 or this I burn it I do not know with a big 

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:56.190
 activity during the day is going to end 

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:58.289
 accumulating as fat so much 

00:04:56.190 --> 00:05:00.930
 eye when they go out to breakfast when 

00:04:58.289 --> 00:05:02.580
 go with friends with family and take care of it 

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:04.770
 more possible the amount of carbohydrates 

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:06.960
 that they are consuming and the amount of 

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:08.970
 fats that are consuming I command them 

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:10.770
