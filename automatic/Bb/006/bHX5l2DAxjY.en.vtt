not<00:01:42.219> the<00:01:42.340> best<00:01:42.369> way<00:01:42.700> to<00:01:42.759> run<00:01:42.969> a<00:01:43.000> studio<00:01:43.299> motor

00:01:43.559 --> 00:01:43.569 
not the best way to run a studio motor

00:02:18.439 --> 00:02:31.750 
I think it's got some other minor curb
issues<00:02:26.739> matter<00:02:27.739> it's<00:02:27.980> not<00:02:28.040> warmed<00:02:28.459> up<00:02:30.760> I'll

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:31.760 
issues matter it's not warmed up I'll

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:40.059 
issues matter it's not warmed up I'll
try<00:02:31.909> it<00:02:32.030> again<00:02:38.439> have<00:02:39.439> to<00:02:39.560> keep<00:02:39.709> praying

00:02:40.059 --> 00:02:40.069 
try it again have to keep praying

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:42.000 
try it again have to keep praying
spraying<00:02:40.459> the<00:02:40.579> card<00:02:40.819> to<00:02:40.939> get<00:02:41.030> it<00:02:41.120> to<00:02:41.209> fire<00:02:41.450> so

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.010 
spraying the card to get it to fire so

00:02:42.010 --> 00:03:17.540 
spraying the card to get it to fire so
if<00:02:43.010> it's<00:02:43.159> a<00:02:43.250> choke<00:02:43.519> issue<00:02:43.730> or<00:02:44.030> what

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:17.550 

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:19.500 

taillight<00:03:18.550> doesn't<00:03:18.880> work<00:03:19.000> but<00:03:19.150> the<00:03:19.209> headlight

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:19.510 
taillight doesn't work but the headlight

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:21.050 
taillight doesn't work but the headlight
works<00:03:19.720> that's<00:03:20.080> a<00:03:20.200> good<00:03:20.350> sign

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060 
works that's a good sign

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:24.870 
works that's a good sign
anyway<00:03:22.060> it's<00:03:22.330> a<00:03:22.420> project
