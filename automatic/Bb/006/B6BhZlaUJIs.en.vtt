align<00:03:22.730> your<00:03:22.970> connection<00:03:23.570> your<00:03:23.600> network

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:24.140 
align your connection your network

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:26.680 
align your connection your network
connection<00:03:24.650> with<00:03:24.800> your<00:03:24.950> Xbox<00:03:25.270> go<00:03:26.270> to<00:03:26.300> test

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:26.690 
connection with your Xbox go to test

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:28.990 
connection with your Xbox go to test
connection<00:03:26.990> and<00:03:27.410> click<00:03:27.920> on<00:03:28.100> that<00:03:28.280> it<00:03:28.940> will

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:29.000 
connection and click on that it will

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.880 
connection and click on that it will
then<00:03:29.240> say<00:03:29.450> signing<00:03:29.900> everybody<00:03:30.290> out<00:03:30.440> that's

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:30.890 
then say signing everybody out that's

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:31.240 
then say signing everybody out that's
good

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:31.250 
good

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:33.220 
good
that's<00:03:31.430> what<00:03:31.580> you<00:03:31.670> want<00:03:31.850> let<00:03:32.690> it<00:03:32.810> find<00:03:33.020> its

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:33.230 
that's what you want let it find its

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:35.140 
that's what you want let it find its
bite<00:03:33.470> again<00:03:33.680> so<00:03:34.340> basically<00:03:34.490> what<00:03:35.030> you're

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:35.150 
bite again so basically what you're

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:36.910 
bite again so basically what you're
doing<00:03:35.180> is<00:03:35.960> you're<00:03:36.140> kind<00:03:36.380> of<00:03:36.530> giving<00:03:36.740> it<00:03:36.860> a

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:36.920 
doing is you're kind of giving it a

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:39.820 
doing is you're kind of giving it a
reboot<00:03:37.400> once<00:03:38.210> that's<00:03:38.480> done<00:03:38.720> go<00:03:38.990> back<00:03:39.380> into

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:39.830 
reboot once that's done go back into

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:42.760 
reboot once that's done go back into
black<00:03:40.040> ops<00:03:40.220> 2<00:03:40.370> and<00:03:40.700> have<00:03:41.210> a<00:03:41.240> nice<00:03:41.450> time<00:03:41.780> you<00:03:42.620> see

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:42.770 
black ops 2 and have a nice time you see

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:44.890 
black ops 2 and have a nice time you see
for<00:03:42.950> me<00:03:43.070> this<00:03:43.100> worked<00:03:43.520> and<00:03:44.030> the<00:03:44.240> only<00:03:44.360> reason<00:03:44.660> I

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:44.900 
for me this worked and the only reason I

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:47.410 
for me this worked and the only reason I
can<00:03:44.960> explain<00:03:45.530> why<00:03:45.980> this<00:03:46.040> may<00:03:46.430> have<00:03:46.550> worked<00:03:46.580> is

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:47.420 
can explain why this may have worked is

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:49.750 
can explain why this may have worked is
because<00:03:47.480> this<00:03:48.140> when<00:03:48.980> the<00:03:49.100> find<00:03:49.340> people<00:03:49.640> are

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:49.760 
because this when the find people are

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:51.910 
because this when the find people are
try<00:03:50.000> arc<00:03:50.180> initiate<00:03:50.780> a<00:03:50.810> patch<00:03:51.170> onto<00:03:51.530> your<00:03:51.650> game

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:51.920 
try arc initiate a patch onto your game

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:54.700 
try arc initiate a patch onto your game
you<00:03:52.490> have<00:03:52.700> to<00:03:52.880> download<00:03:53.240> it<00:03:53.450> obviously<00:03:54.140> now

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:54.710 
you have to download it obviously now

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:57.010 
you have to download it obviously now
maybe<00:03:55.130> and<00:03:55.400> this<00:03:55.520> is<00:03:55.670> just<00:03:55.910> a<00:03:56.030> guess<00:03:56.270> it<00:03:56.780> adds

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:57.020 
maybe and this is just a guess it adds

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:59.050 
maybe and this is just a guess it adds
clutter<00:03:57.410> and<00:03:57.800> it<00:03:57.950> kind<00:03:58.250> of<00:03:58.400> I<00:03:58.550> don't<00:03:58.970> know

00:03:59.050 --> 00:03:59.060 
clutter and it kind of I don't know

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:01.990 
clutter and it kind of I don't know
maybe<00:03:59.600> causes<00:04:00.170> your<00:04:00.350> Xbox<00:04:00.860> or<00:04:01.040> your<00:04:01.190> ps3<00:04:01.790> to

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:02.000 
maybe causes your Xbox or your ps3 to

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.630 
maybe causes your Xbox or your ps3 to
kind<00:04:02.270> of<00:04:02.390> fall<00:04:02.720> out<00:04:02.750> with<00:04:03.170> your<00:04:03.380> router<00:04:03.680> so

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:04.640 
kind of fall out with your router so

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:06.100 
kind of fall out with your router so
essentially<00:04:05.120> what<00:04:05.270> is<00:04:05.300> happening<00:04:05.870> your

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:06.110 
essentially what is happening your

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:08.170 
essentially what is happening your
console<00:04:06.710> isn't<00:04:07.280> speaking<00:04:07.550> to<00:04:07.820> your<00:04:07.940> router

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:08.180 
console isn't speaking to your router

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:10.390 
console isn't speaking to your router
correctly<00:04:08.750> kind<00:04:09.410> of<00:04:09.500> like<00:04:09.680> a<00:04:09.710> couple<00:04:10.100> who's

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:10.400 
correctly kind of like a couple who's

with life there you've just bought them

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:38.020 
with life there you've just bought them
back<00:04:37.280> together<00:04:37.490> again

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:38.030 
back together again

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:39.940 
back together again
now<00:04:38.480> again<00:04:38.810> I<00:04:38.960> always<00:04:39.350> say<00:04:39.530> I'm<00:04:39.740> not

now again I always say I'm not
guaranteeing<00:04:40.160> this<00:04:40.670> will<00:04:40.910> work<00:04:41.320> 110<00:04:42.320> percent

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:42.710 
guaranteeing this will work 110 percent

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:45.640 
guaranteeing this will work 110 percent
but<00:04:43.160> it<00:04:43.610> worked<00:04:43.910> for<00:04:44.060> me<00:04:44.360> and<00:04:44.540> it<00:04:45.080> worked<00:04:45.500> for

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:45.650 
but it worked for me and it worked for

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:47.560 
but it worked for me and it worked for
somebody<00:04:45.950> else<00:04:46.070> who<00:04:46.220> told<00:04:46.430> me<00:04:46.580> about<00:04:46.610> it<00:04:46.970> maybe

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:47.570 
somebody else who told me about it maybe

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:49.570 
somebody else who told me about it maybe
it<00:04:47.690> can<00:04:47.840> work<00:04:47.870> for<00:04:48.200> you<00:04:48.350> the<00:04:48.830> reason<00:04:49.190> I<00:04:49.280> feel

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:49.580 
it can work for you the reason I feel

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:52.000 
it can work for you the reason I feel
that<00:04:49.850> my<00:04:50.150> own<00:04:50.300> personal<00:04:50.870> evidence<00:04:51.290> for<00:04:51.500> myself

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:52.010 
that my own personal evidence for myself

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:54.490 
that my own personal evidence for myself
is<00:04:52.220> justified<00:04:52.940> that<00:04:53.150> this<00:04:53.330> does<00:04:53.600> work<00:04:53.870> is

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:54.500 
is justified that this does work is

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:55.810 
is justified that this does work is
because<00:04:54.890> before<00:04:55.250> the<00:04:55.370> patch<00:04:55.550> actually

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:55.820 
because before the patch actually

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:58.660 
because before the patch actually
happened<00:04:56.510> for<00:04:57.380> a<00:04:57.410> while<00:04:57.710> every<00:04:58.100> time<00:04:58.280> I<00:04:58.310> turn

00:04:58.660 --> 00:04:58.670 
happened for a while every time I turn

00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:00.610 
happened for a while every time I turn
my<00:04:58.700> xbox<00:04:59.270> on<00:04:59.480> it<00:04:59.870> wouldn't<00:05:00.260> find<00:05:00.440> my

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:00.620 
my xbox on it wouldn't find my

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:02.590 
my xbox on it wouldn't find my
connection<00:05:01.190> so<00:05:01.640> I<00:05:01.850> would<00:05:02.000> have<00:05:02.150> to<00:05:02.270> go<00:05:02.390> into<00:05:02.510> my

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:02.600 
connection so I would have to go into my

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:05.830 
connection so I would have to go into my
