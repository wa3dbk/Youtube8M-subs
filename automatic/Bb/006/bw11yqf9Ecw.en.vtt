University<00:00:05.370> the<00:00:06.210> overall<00:00:06.569> goal<00:00:06.810> of<00:00:06.839> my

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:07.109 
University the overall goal of my

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:11.410 
University the overall goal of my
project<00:00:07.680> was<00:00:07.799> to<00:00:08.510> assess<00:00:09.510> the<00:00:10.070> diversity<00:00:11.070> of

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:11.420 
project was to assess the diversity of

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:13.940 
project was to assess the diversity of
porcupines<00:00:12.420> here<00:00:13.110> in<00:00:13.380> the<00:00:13.469> st.<00:00:13.679> Lawrence

University<00:00:14.099> Kip<00:00:14.639> tract<00:00:14.940> and<00:00:15.269> to<00:00:16.199> do<00:00:16.320> that<00:00:16.560> I

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
University Kip tract and to do that I

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.670 
University Kip tract and to do that I
actually<00:00:17.490> used<00:00:17.940> a<00:00:18.119> kind<00:00:18.359> of<00:00:18.480> molecular<00:00:19.170> marker

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
actually used a kind of molecular marker

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.640 
actually used a kind of molecular marker
that<00:00:20.400> differentiates<00:00:21.180> among<00:00:21.539> porcupines<00:00:22.140> and

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
that differentiates among porcupines and

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.570 
that differentiates among porcupines and
can<00:00:23.310> also<00:00:23.460> be<00:00:23.640> used<00:00:23.910> as<00:00:24.869> paternity<00:00:25.439> testing<00:00:25.949> so

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
can also be used as paternity testing so

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.070 
can also be used as paternity testing so
we<00:00:26.670> can<00:00:26.820> tell<00:00:27.000> where<00:00:27.269> the<00:00:27.390> porcupines<00:00:27.930> are

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
we can tell where the porcupines are

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.589 
we can tell where the porcupines are
moving<00:00:28.470> who<00:00:28.710> they're<00:00:28.890> mating<00:00:29.099> with<00:00:29.429> and<00:00:29.789> also

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
moving who they're mating with and also

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.680 
moving who they're mating with and also
if<00:00:30.929> maybe<00:00:31.800> roads<00:00:32.219> will<00:00:32.579> impact<00:00:32.940> the

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
if maybe roads will impact the

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.709 
if maybe roads will impact the
separation<00:00:34.260> of<00:00:34.320> populations<00:00:35.270> my<00:00:36.270> project

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
separation of populations my project

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:39.200 
separation of populations my project
involved<00:00:37.260> developing<00:00:37.820> microsatellites<00:00:38.820> for

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
involved developing microsatellites for

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.290 
involved developing microsatellites for
use<00:00:39.390> in<00:00:39.690> genotyping<00:00:40.649> porcupines<00:00:41.399> the

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
use in genotyping porcupines the

eventual<00:00:42.600> goal<00:00:42.870> the<00:00:43.110> project<00:00:43.530> is<00:00:43.649> be<00:00:43.800> able<00:00:43.980> to

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
eventual goal the project is be able to

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:45.799 
eventual goal the project is be able to
genotype<00:00:44.370> the<00:00:44.640> porcupines<00:00:45.090> on<00:00:45.239> the<00:00:45.329> Kip<00:00:45.480> tract

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
genotype the porcupines on the Kip tract

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:49.310 
genotype the porcupines on the Kip tract
and<00:00:46.140> as<00:00:47.039> of<00:00:47.190> now<00:00:47.370> we<00:00:47.399> have<00:00:47.640> DNA<00:00:48.539> from<00:00:48.780> 44

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
and as of now we have DNA from 44

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:50.930 
and as of now we have DNA from 44
individuals<00:00:49.890> which<00:00:50.070> we<00:00:50.250> are<00:00:50.309> using<00:00:50.579> to

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
individuals which we are using to

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.250 
individuals which we are using to
actually<00:00:51.090> develop<00:00:51.719> these<00:00:51.989> microsatellites

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:54.260 
actually develop these microsatellites

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.350 
actually develop these microsatellites
the<00:00:55.260> microsoft<00:00:55.739> i<00:00:56.070> am<00:00:56.129> looking<00:00:56.460> for<00:00:56.730> a<00:00:57.000> mostly

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
the microsoft i am looking for a mostly

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.860 
the microsoft i am looking for a mostly
simple<00:00:58.129> AC<00:00:59.210> dinucleotide<00:01:00.210> repeats<00:01:00.660> the

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
simple AC dinucleotide repeats the

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.680 
simple AC dinucleotide repeats the
simpler<00:01:01.230> the<00:01:01.289> better<00:01:01.460> so<00:01:02.460> we<00:01:03.210> started<00:01:03.539> off<00:01:03.660> a

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
simpler the better so we started off a

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.890 
simpler the better so we started off a
semester<00:01:04.320> actually<00:01:04.890> this<00:01:05.010> year<00:01:05.460> with<00:01:06.210> three

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
semester actually this year with three

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.300 
semester actually this year with three
primers<00:01:07.350> that<00:01:07.380> had<00:01:07.680> been<00:01:07.830> developed<00:01:07.920> for

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
primers that had been developed for

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.399 
primers that had been developed for
three<00:01:09.000> potential<00:01:09.450> microsatellite<00:01:10.049> regions

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
three potential microsatellite regions

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:13.730 
three potential microsatellite regions
and<00:01:10.970> we<00:01:11.970> increase<00:01:12.240> that<00:01:12.390> number<00:01:12.450> 2<00:01:12.810> 12<00:01:13.110> by<00:01:13.680> the

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
and we increase that number 2 12 by the

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.249 
and we increase that number 2 12 by the
end<00:01:13.920> of<00:01:14.010> the<00:01:14.100> semester<00:01:14.220> and<00:01:14.790> so<00:01:15.450> far<00:01:15.720> eight<00:01:16.049> of

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
end of the semester and so far eight of

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:19.190 
end of the semester and so far eight of
those<00:01:16.409> have<00:01:16.470> showed<00:01:16.950> amplification<00:01:17.790> of<00:01:18.200> the

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
those have showed amplification of the

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.289 
those have showed amplification of the
sequences<00:01:19.650> that<00:01:19.680> were<00:01:19.830> looking<00:01:20.159> for<00:01:20.400> and<00:01:20.700> we

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
sequences that were looking for and we

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:22.789 
sequences that were looking for and we
are<00:01:21.390> testing<00:01:21.689> those<00:01:21.869> for<00:01:22.020> polymorphism<00:01:22.770> to

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
are testing those for polymorphism to

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:24.469 
are testing those for polymorphism to
determine<00:01:23.340> the<00:01:23.430> levels<00:01:23.759> of<00:01:23.970> genetic

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
determine the levels of genetic

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.620 
determine the levels of genetic
differentiation<00:01:24.930> within<00:01:25.470> the<00:01:25.619> population<00:01:26.630> my

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
differentiation within the population my

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.080 
differentiation within the population my
DNA<00:01:28.049> samples<00:01:28.619> I<00:01:29.070> would<00:01:29.579> sometimes

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
DNA samples I would sometimes

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.300 
DNA samples I would sometimes
participate<00:01:30.780> in<00:01:30.990> the<00:01:31.170> live<00:01:31.350> trapping<00:01:31.979> that<00:01:32.159> my

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
participate in the live trapping that my

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.569 
participate in the live trapping that my
love<00:01:32.520> would<00:01:32.729> go<00:01:32.970> on<00:01:33.150> they<00:01:34.040> they<00:01:35.040> trap<00:01:35.369> and

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
love would go on they they trap and

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:37.039 
love would go on they they trap and
monitor<00:01:35.909> porcupines<00:01:36.420> for<00:01:36.659> home<00:01:36.810> range

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
monitor porcupines for home range

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.380 
monitor porcupines for home range
analysis<00:01:37.619> and<00:01:37.920> because<00:01:38.790> my<00:01:38.820> project<00:01:39.329> is

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
analysis and because my project is

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.859 
analysis and because my project is
somewhat<00:01:39.810> new<00:01:40.049> they<00:01:40.920> decided<00:01:41.310> to<00:01:41.610> collect<00:01:42.060> DNA

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
somewhat new they decided to collect DNA

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.630 
somewhat new they decided to collect DNA
samples<00:01:43.079> from<00:01:43.619> the<00:01:43.890> parking<00:01:44.189> fines<00:01:44.369> that<00:01:44.490> they

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
samples from the parking fines that they

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.139 
samples from the parking fines that they
just<00:01:44.700> they<00:01:44.970> trapped<00:01:45.270> for<00:01:45.659> genotyping<00:01:46.110> and

00:01:47.139 --> 00:01:47.149 
just they trapped for genotyping and

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:50.560 
just they trapped for genotyping and
that<00:01:48.149> was<00:01:48.240> a<00:01:48.270> lot<00:01:48.479> of<00:01:48.600> fun<00:01:48.950> my<00:01:49.950> work<00:01:50.100> in<00:01:50.250> the<00:01:50.340> lab

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:50.570 
that was a lot of fun my work in the lab

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:52.460 
that was a lot of fun my work in the lab
involves<00:01:51.570> a<00:01:51.659> bunch<00:01:51.869> of<00:01:51.990> different<00:01:52.290> things

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470
