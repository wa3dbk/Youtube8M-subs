now<00:00:01.319> this<00:00:01.620> is<00:00:01.770> the<00:00:01.890> Nokia<00:00:02.040> n900<00:00:02.580> you<00:00:03.570> see<00:00:03.810> here

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:04.080 
now this is the Nokia n900 you see here

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:06.889 
now this is the Nokia n900 you see here
it's<00:00:04.170> not<00:00:04.230> negative<00:00:04.529> anything<00:00:05.009> by<00:00:05.279> booth<00:00:05.899> but

00:00:06.889 --> 00:00:06.899 
it's not negative anything by booth but

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:13.520 
it's not negative anything by booth but
if<00:00:07.109> we<00:00:07.319> turn<00:00:07.529> on<00:00:07.710> the<00:00:07.890> pH<00:00:08.570> 5:05<00:00:12.230> just<00:00:13.230> press

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
if we turn on the pH 5:05 just press

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.790 
if we turn on the pH 5:05 just press
this<00:00:15.109> weight<00:00:16.109> would<00:00:16.350> really<00:00:16.560> like<00:00:16.680> to

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
this weight would really like to

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.990 
this weight would really like to
come<00:00:16.890> on<00:00:17.660> and<00:00:19.189> now<00:00:20.189> it'll<00:00:20.400> say<00:00:20.699> it's

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
come on and now it'll say it's

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.109 
come on and now it'll say it's
automatically<00:00:21.900> connected<00:00:22.850> like<00:00:23.850> this<00:00:23.880> should

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
automatically connected like this should

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:25.189 
automatically connected like this should
be<00:00:24.210> gauge<00:00:24.359> right<00:00:24.539> you're<00:00:24.750> fine

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
be gauge right you're fine

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:27.769 
be gauge right you're fine
now<00:00:26.160> you<00:00:26.220> can<00:00:26.519> use<00:00:26.730> the<00:00:27.029> music<00:00:27.539> player

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
now you can use the music player

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:31.910 
now you can use the music player
controls<00:00:28.380> on<00:00:28.769> the<00:00:28.830> pH<00:00:29.070> 5:05<00:00:29.730> to<00:00:30.590> manage<00:00:31.590> these

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
controls on the pH 5:05 to manage these

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:38.500 
controls on the pH 5:05 to manage these
player<00:00:32.189> of<00:00:32.369> you<00:00:32.730> can<00:00:32.910> I<00:00:33.030> have<00:00:33.180> it

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:38.510

back down to go back volume buttons are
on<00:00:58.469> this<00:00:58.800> side<00:00:59.070> you've<00:01:00.000> got<00:01:00.210> two<00:01:00.420> ways<00:01:00.629> to

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
on this side you've got two ways to

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:05.030 
on this side you've got two ways to
control<00:01:00.930> the<00:01:01.410> volume<00:01:01.590> buttons<00:01:02.719> use<00:01:03.719> this<00:01:04.110> on

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
control the volume buttons use this on

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.289 
control the volume buttons use this on
the<00:01:05.189> n900<00:01:05.460> and<00:01:07.250> yes<00:01:08.250> on<00:01:08.610> the<00:01:08.729> beach<00:01:08.970> i<00:01:09.090> zero

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
the n900 and yes on the beach i zero

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:10.670 
the n900 and yes on the beach i zero
five<00:01:09.510> they're<00:01:09.689> independent<00:01:10.260> of<00:01:10.350> each<00:01:10.409> other

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
five they're independent of each other

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.280 
five they're independent of each other
so<00:01:10.979> to<00:01:11.189> get<00:01:11.460> a<00:01:11.520> maximum<00:01:11.820> total<00:01:12.390> volume<00:01:12.810> put

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
so to get a maximum total volume put

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:14.420 
so to get a maximum total volume put
this<00:01:13.439> all<00:01:13.650> the<00:01:13.740> way<00:01:13.799> up<00:01:13.890> on<00:01:14.010> the<00:01:14.100> end<00:01:14.220> in<00:01:14.310> who

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
this all the way up on the end in who

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.550 
this all the way up on the end in who
need<00:01:14.580> this<00:01:15.390> all<00:01:15.600> the<00:01:15.720> way<00:01:15.810> up<00:01:15.840> on<00:01:16.140> the<00:01:16.290> beach

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
need this all the way up on the beach

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:17.840 
need this all the way up on the beach
was<00:01:16.740> your<00:01:16.890> fight<00:01:17.040> but<00:01:17.189> if<00:01:17.250> you<00:01:17.340> do<00:01:17.430> this<00:01:17.549> you're

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
was your fight but if you do this you're

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.460 
was your fight but if you do this you're
guaranteed<00:01:18.570> to<00:01:18.780> go<00:01:19.020> down<00:01:20.900> well<00:01:21.900> so<00:01:22.080> let's<00:01:22.229> show

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
guaranteed to go down well so let's show

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.969 
guaranteed to go down well so let's show
you<00:01:22.530> how<00:01:22.799> to<00:01:22.860> pair<00:01:23.159> up<00:01:23.310> the<00:01:23.520> pH<00:01:24.210> one<00:01:24.420> zero<00:01:24.630> five

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:24.979 
you how to pair up the pH one zero five

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:30.410 
you how to pair up the pH one zero five
so<00:01:25.979> let's<00:01:26.009> just<00:01:26.430> disconnect<00:01:26.970> this<00:01:29.420> that's

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
so let's just disconnect this that's

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:41.140 
so let's just disconnect this that's
disconnected<00:01:31.670> go<00:01:32.670> through<00:01:32.880> glitches<00:01:36.140> devices

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:41.150 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:43.840 

wonder<00:01:42.150> they<00:01:42.270> can't<00:01:42.479> really<00:01:42.659> see<00:01:42.780> the<00:01:42.869> screen

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:43.850 
wonder they can't really see the screen

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:48.060 
wonder they can't really see the screen
to<00:01:44.850> me<00:01:45.320> yes

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:48.070 
to me yes

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:57.760 
to me yes
okay<00:01:50.320> turn<00:01:51.320> on<00:01:51.440> the<00:01:51.620> h50<00:01:52.250> five<00:01:56.560> pair<00:01:57.560> up<00:01:57.680> with

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:57.770 
okay turn on the h50 five pair up with

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:00.280 
okay turn on the h50 five pair up with
the<00:01:57.890> h50<00:01:58.460> five<00:01:58.700> you<00:01:58.850> have<00:01:59.000> to<00:01:59.120> hold<00:01:59.390> power

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:00.290 
the h50 five you have to hold power

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:03.130 
the h50 five you have to hold power
button<00:02:00.350> until<00:02:00.800> the<00:02:01.130> flashlights<00:02:02.140> keeps

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:03.140 
button until the flashlights keeps

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:06.010 
button until the flashlights keeps
watching<00:02:03.350> blue<00:02:03.680> like<00:02:03.890> this<00:02:04.630> that<00:02:05.630> means<00:02:05.840> it's

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:06.020 
watching blue like this that means it's

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:07.200 
watching blue like this that means it's
in<00:02:06.170> pair<00:02:06.410> mode

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:07.210 
in pair mode

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:13.180 
in pair mode
so<00:02:08.470> just<00:02:09.470> select<00:02:09.590> your<00:02:10.100> advice<00:02:11.980> fine<00:02:12.980> to<00:02:13.070> be<00:02:13.160> a

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190 
so just select your advice fine to be a

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:18.460 
so just select your advice fine to be a
choice<00:02:13.460> or<00:02:13.640> five<00:02:15.220> it<00:02:16.220> should<00:02:16.280> just<00:02:16.820> care<00:02:17.450> if<00:02:18.260> it

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:18.470 
choice or five it should just care if it

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:20.770 
choice or five it should just care if it
asks<00:02:18.680> for<00:02:19.130> a<00:02:19.190> code<00:02:19.400> it's<00:02:19.640> zero<00:02:20.180> zero<00:02:20.240> zero<00:02:20.510> zero

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780 
asks for a code it's zero zero zero zero

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:24.190 
asks for a code it's zero zero zero zero
but<00:02:21.170> I<00:02:21.380> think<00:02:22.090> automatic<00:02:23.090> doesn't<00:02:23.750> need<00:02:23.900> a

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.200 
but I think automatic doesn't need a

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:27.130 
but I think automatic doesn't need a
code<00:02:25.240> so<00:02:26.240> there<00:02:26.390> you<00:02:26.450> go<00:02:26.510> that's<00:02:26.720> connected

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:27.140 
code so there you go that's connected

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:37.470 
code so there you go that's connected
again<00:02:35.050> it'll<00:02:36.050> control<00:02:36.440> play<00:02:36.650> a<00:02:36.680> play<00:02:37.280> of

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480 
again it'll control play a play of

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:41.380 
again it'll control play a play of
things<00:02:38.480> like<00:02:38.690> before<00:02:39.940> it<00:02:40.940> should<00:02:41.270> also

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:41.390 
things like before it should also

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:44.080 
things like before it should also
control<00:02:41.900> videos<00:02:42.620> and<00:02:43.280> see<00:02:43.430> what<00:02:43.580> videos<00:02:43.910> I

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.090 
control videos and see what videos I

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:49.600 
control videos and see what videos I
hear<00:02:44.630> it's<00:02:44.870> not<00:02:44.990> very<00:02:45.200> much<00:02:48.520> because<00:02:49.520> I've

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:49.610 
hear it's not very much because I've

00:02:49.610 --> 00:03:01.510 
hear it's not very much because I've
deleted<00:02:49.970> all<00:02:50.420> my<00:02:50.450> stuff

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:01.520 

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:07.330 

so<00:03:03.940> players<00:03:04.940> should<00:03:05.390> work<00:03:05.600> for<00:03:05.930> the<00:03:06.530> videos<00:03:06.980> as

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:07.340 
so players should work for the videos as

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:11.310 
so players should work for the videos as
well<00:03:08.920> see<00:03:09.920> what<00:03:10.070> it<00:03:10.160> don't<00:03:10.370> you

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:11.320 
well see what it don't you

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:14.890 
well see what it don't you
it<00:03:12.320> resumed<00:03:12.770> from<00:03:13.070> the<00:03:13.220> last<00:03:13.400> playback<00:03:13.900> so

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:14.900 
it resumed from the last playback so

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:24.460 
it resumed from the last playback so
let's<00:03:15.410> play<00:03:16.900> and<00:03:17.900> that's<00:03:18.080> paused<00:03:20.050> again<00:03:23.470> and
