00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:11.649
 if you have the head in this set his list has specified the choice 

00:00:11.649 --> 00:00:13.899
 and who want to write 

00:00:13.899 --> 00:00:16.899
 we tested a large amd platform 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.079
 it will reinforce closed m 

00:00:20.079 --> 00:00:21.779
 to make this recipe 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:23.210
 brothers 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:26.220
 and the senate the study 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:27.640
 perfect m 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:30.739
 miliband five points 

00:00:30.739 --> 00:00:35.949
 his mother over 1,600 hectares it would be very long 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.120
 to support his eyes 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:43.160
 burst when it's hot in the heart 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.180
 will follow 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:49.180
 by the way s &amp; p alas 

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:54.629
 seventeen countries see it is surprising that he had to let go 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:55.900
 second place 

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:56.930
 Dallaire 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:59.190
 and Russia 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.290
 so now that we know in an interview at the show starts in 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:03.050
 three weeks 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:05.560
 we will stay here 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:07.450
 our father 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:10.450
 root 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.150
 a story 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:17.020
 we had 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:19.130
 in 2006 it's all 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:20.190
 with 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:22.430
 our mission 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:24.920
 during this time so we're going 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:26.290
 according to 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:28.640
 our thought 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:31.640
 created talk about the masters 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:37.960
 I think we will stay 

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:42.340
 our two countries and to support magna 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:43.650
 all the flavors 

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:45.730
 what he releases 

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:47.970
 Without forgetting 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.610
 Nevertheless 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:52.610
 according to you why 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.790
 why are we going now 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:58.080
 bercy 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:01.020
 our men in the preparation 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.300
 after the score 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:07.570
 then we will take the time the mushrooms 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:09.399
 so we will cut 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:11.049
 roughly 

00:02:11.049 --> 00:02:12.739
 and we go 

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:14.649
 neither master 

00:02:14.649 --> 00:02:17.829
 so in our preparation 

00:02:17.829 --> 00:02:21.250
 we will now take another train we will do 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:23.519
 small waste 

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:25.789
 a few centimeters 

00:02:25.789 --> 00:02:28.109
 not only the site 

00:02:28.109 --> 00:02:31.109
 2006 

00:02:32.259 --> 00:02:35.259
 we will now proceed 

00:02:38.529 --> 00:02:39.779
 not easy 

00:02:39.779 --> 00:02:42.779
 our first lady 

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:47.109
 sew roughly 

00:02:47.109 --> 00:02:50.109
 the mountain 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:54.689
 we are going now 

00:02:54.689 --> 00:02:57.689
 put it in our comparator of the meeting 

00:02:59.439 --> 00:03:00.689
 no 

00:03:00.689 --> 00:03:01.929
 we go 

00:03:01.929 --> 00:03:03.649
 his mission 

00:03:03.649 --> 00:03:06.649
 is not rich and you can possibly 

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:10.139
 brush with soft butter 

00:03:10.139 --> 00:03:11.699
 she was standing there 

00:03:11.699 --> 00:03:13.699
 the skin 

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:14.900
 it's an observation 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:16.239
 200 degrees 

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:17.190
 Warning 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:19.960
 pretty much we do not hold back the gap 

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:23.300
 to watch you can possibly water time his 

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.849
 time 

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:24.939
 two exits of crisis
