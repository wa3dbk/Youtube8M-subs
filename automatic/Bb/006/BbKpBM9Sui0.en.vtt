 73 instruments on stage 

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:58.129
 for something is the greatest orchestra of pulse and fine prong 

00:03:58.129 --> 00:04:01.429
 The most curious thing is that very few of its members have studied music 

00:04:02.969 --> 00:04:04.519
 I will continue in 

00:04:04.519 --> 00:04:06.749
 in a secret ceremony 

00:04:06.749 --> 00:04:11.259
 but they are musicians are good musicians play very well most 

00:04:12.499 --> 00:04:16.989
 and it has a lot of musicality, do not reveal it in musical symbols 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:19.650
 conventional but they read it 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:22.650
 much with the heart and with the numbers or what we carry 

00:04:24.779 --> 00:04:26.509

 kraus maría dolores pradera or nati mistral and with the same desire as 

00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:38.169
 once they put on the road to give up to 20 concerts a year for all 

00:04:38.169 --> 00:04:40.689

00:04:49.069 --> 00:04:53.389
 intopress the most important thing is the coexistence we have had among others 

00:04:53.389 --> 00:04:55.069
 I consider 

00:04:55.069 --> 00:04:57.460
 praiseworthy for me 

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:59.990
 besides the same illusion 

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:01.430

00:05:13.789 --> 00:05:15.900
