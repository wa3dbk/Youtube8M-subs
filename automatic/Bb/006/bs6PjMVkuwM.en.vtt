00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:12.950
 exactly 

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:21.150
 bbr it is a smaller version 

00:00:18.689 --> 00:00:23.610
 the older model heron form these 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.470
 lures are exactly the same but 

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:28.380
 significant difference in size made 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:31.759
 their work is different and therefore applicable 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.759
 they are completely different conditions 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:08.590
 starts starts 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:08.590
 back home wants now we let it go 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:23.190
 jackil baby hero is bait 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:25.500
 point application it weighs very 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:28.620
 little and besides is a composition not lump 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:31.500
 and this affects the casting distance 

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:33.330
 on from that suffers greatly on 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.870
 open spaces use this 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:37.530
 wobbler 

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:39.540
 makes no sense but in such 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:42.500
 local points like for example here under 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:46.410
 reed wall where periodically pike 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:49.580
 manifests itself can be applied with success 

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:49.580
 this carbon 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:57.440
 the depth at this place is quite 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:02:00.630
 insignificant and immediately pike pecked 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:03.930
 I wanted to say that when wiring is better 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:05.729
 just raise the end of the spinning 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:08.160
 up so that he was almost 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:13.770
 vertical then the angle of attack changes and 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:17.340
 the bait goes to the highest layer of water if 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:22.860
 do it right 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:26.750
 must succeed pike but not 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:26.750
 bypass this wobbler side 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:38.140
 good pike did not give me really 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:41.560
 tell about how to lead this wobbler 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:44.770
 so now try to repeat your 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:46.480
 the story if I have not forgotten anything of course 

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:49.240
 naturally, you first need a bait 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:51.460
 throw the maximum distance on 

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:53.890
 which allows run-rowan 

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:54.780
 depending on what depth 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:57.820
 place of fishing 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:03:00.490
 you need to change the depth of the bait 

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:03.490
 so still without blades besides 

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:05.709
 sinking its burial changes only 

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:08.920
 angle of attack spinning naturally 

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:11.230
 wiring speed so here if the depth 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:12.640
 big enough then the end of the spinning 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:15.430
 you need to let go like this down and 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:18.790
 the bait goes to the maximum for 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:22.570
 self deepening if same deep as 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:24.160
 for example now does not exceed 20-25 

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:27.070
 centimeters then naturally 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:30.010
 end of the spinning lift up and do 

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:32.770
 such here are light ryvochki only in 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:35.020
 In this case, you can bypass all the underwater 

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:36.190
 obstacles and hold the bait with 

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:38.170
 most effective 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:41.250
 Well, it should be noted that this bait is not 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:44.670
 no nuances therefore to the pond 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:47.890
 feed bait fish 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:49.360
 you must enter it in the following way 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:52.780
 after splashdown 

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:55.480
 start very easy habits 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:59.670
 quite active but the boxes and 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:59.670
 and there should be enough 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:40.360
 unlike his younger brother 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:41.849
 big hero to fully disclose 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:44.650
 their abilities in open areas 

00:04:41.849 --> 00:04:47.860
 shallow water is clogged large rivers 

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:49.719
 peals and not deep areas of lakes with 

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:52.289
 the animation of this wobbler not 

00:04:49.719 --> 00:04:54.400
 this simple jerk wiring occurs 

00:04:52.289 --> 00:04:57.310
 quite energetic frequent 

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:59.229
 the hero suspenders has a very wide 

00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:00.810
 scattering movements during twitching and 

00:04:59.229 --> 00:05:03.159
 optimal flight performance 

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:04.389
 so the bait is good 

00:05:03.159 --> 00:05:07.419
 established itself as 

00:05:04.389 --> 00:05:09.370
 scout in other words with his help 

00:05:07.419 --> 00:05:13.319
 very convenient to comb through significant 

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:15.669
 water area in search of places of predator parking 

00:05:13.319 --> 00:05:17.250
 the difference in size between large and small 

00:05:15.669 --> 00:05:19.750
 biron significantly 

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:21.400
 comparing their dimensions comes logical 

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:22.719
 the conclusion is that there is not enough model 

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:25.389
 intermediate size 

00:05:22.719 --> 00:05:27.310
 which could be successfully applied and 

00:05:25.389 --> 00:05:28.289
 at local points and on open 

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:32.080
 spaces 

00:05:28.289 --> 00:05:35.009
 such a lure is this chatless chat 

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:35.009
 from flt
