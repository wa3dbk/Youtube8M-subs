 there are 11 effective methods and besides 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:35.460
 there are tricks to memorize the term 

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:37.650
 so remember vocabulary words that is 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:40.530
 any information that we 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:43.260
 to that which is important to us and some 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:46.340
 ask why so much as you 

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:46.340
 question why so much 

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:52.590
 of course we're all different, that's how many of you 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:54.780
 someone on the visual of someone that's how you are 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:57.870
 think you need to 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:02:00.900
 remember need to see i eat that 

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:04.730
 someone audial necessarily need to hear 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:07.560
 on servants perceived better there are such 

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:10.140
 By the way, we sometimes don't even know what kind 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.880
 memory works better with us 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.920
 what we start it in general is the list 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:16.890
 let us check our memory 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:19.550
 there are those that just believes that to 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:25.110
 fill it is not necessary to write 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:27.600
 motility using is what everyone has 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:29.580
 someone has his own preferences 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:32.220
 need to see someone hear someone 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:35.190
 will remember emotionally given picture and 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:38.730
 so on what is good about memory types 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:40.200
 we are many some for example when many 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:41.060
 some memory types it may 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:44.130
 scare 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:46.410
 the fact that a lot and for some it 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:49.200
 on the contrary may be good why good 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:51.120
 because the more species you remember 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:54.150
 use when memorizing 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:56.880
 the easier you remember for memory 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:59.130
 we never know what kind of memory we 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:01.110
 help what is easier and easier for you 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:04.380
 remember no there will be easier to remember 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:06.780
 for example, it was like walking down the street 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:09.660
 led so something novel you remembered 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:11.580
 there is not renting 1 any date yes and maybe 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:16.650
 be patties beloved grandmother 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:17.370
 happens to someone it was also heard and 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:19.680
 here is the groove 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:21.989
 again from memory suddenly something surfaced 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:25.019
 remembered something such an event 

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:27.299
 which you think you are already of us 

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:30.959
 forget it so that there was and how we 

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:33.930
 that is, when we contribute immediately 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:36.840
 multiple types of memory is 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:39.930
 it helps us then easier to get 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:42.930
 recall does not mean it will be easier for us 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:45.780
 navigate work with any 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:48.560
 Information The fact is that I noticed 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:51.900
 the product is very often we have people 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:54.030
 scold your memory points scolded you 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:59.640
 his memory at the very moment when 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:04:01.650
 remember often yes but usually it 

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:04.019
 happens you know why that is not the right time 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:06.239
 remembered that is when it was necessary not 

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:08.579
 remembered when you don't need something later 

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:11.280
 surfaced about him starting to scold your boyfriend 

00:04:08.579 --> 00:04:14.489
 and so soskaya not in the face so on 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:17.570
 in fact, I want to tell you this 

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:18.780
 good good news you all have 

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:22.320
 supermemory 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:24.389
 and we are our task for these three months in 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:26.880
 this is not only to make sure and get 

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:28.260
 Excellent results , I will say right away 

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:31.139
 with goals to our course 

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:34.320
 Our dash course has defined a task for 

00:04:31.139 --> 00:04:36.539
 the first month we increase the amount of memory 

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:39.750
 attention and speed and not somewhere in 

00:04:36.539 --> 00:04:42.450
 two or three times is the goal of the first month behind 

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:44.700
 second month well, about 35 times 

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:47.639
 raising so that was my third note 

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:51.460
 month we will take the top 10 times as 

00:04:47.639 --> 00:04:55.610
 you have such a goal program at least 

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:58.699
 ambitious and look at today's 

00:04:55.610 --> 00:05:01.520

 10 show gestures only 10 gesture and 

00:05:06.889 --> 00:05:13.120
 you need to repeat them then ready 

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:45.970
 so 1 2 3 4 

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:29.830
