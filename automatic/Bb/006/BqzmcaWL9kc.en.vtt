00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:09.950
 I practice this today I'm going 

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:11.209
 teach you how to change your 

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:12.860
 wiper blades this is a 

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:14.360
 very simple operation that takes five 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:16.340
 minutes and that saves you from going 

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:18.439
 your mechanic for this operation 

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:20.150
 so benign what to know with 

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:22.730
 the wiper blades change 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:25.039
 about once a year it changes to 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:26.330
 done after winter once there has been 

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:27.349
 big rains all that they are 

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:29.420
 well served that are dumbfounded 

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:30.590
 and that's not more than once a year 

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:31.490
 even twice if you observe 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:33.980
 very much 

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:37.040
 and there too on the windshield wipers you 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:38.690
 see here a small part young saint 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:40.520
 and less wear in fact ie 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:42.500
 that when you loose t he is black and 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:43.760
 then as he goes, he will become 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:45.500
 more and more young and when he is 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:47.270
 young of this color there ie 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:50.030
 it is high time to change your 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:52.010
 wipers to change it is already necessary 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:55.489
 that you buy a pair of acronyms 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:57.379
 so it's in a supermarket 

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:59.660
 where a spare parts store 

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:01.850
 you have to be careful because there is 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:03.320
 several types of wipers that go 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:05.119
 match the brands of the cars and 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:07.190
 to cars models so if you 

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:08.630
 look behind your ice here you 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:09.320
 have an omc list that this list is 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:11.330
 not exhaustive 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:13.250
 for example this mazda model is not 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:14.330
 present on this list and yet this 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:14.660
 are the good ones effective for the good 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:16.009
 car 

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:17.990
 so me what I advise you is 

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:19.160
 to ask the resellers what 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:24.229
 are the good wipers compared 

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:25.459
 to your car model so first 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:28.399
 thing to do is to remove the 

00:01:25.459 --> 00:01:30.800
 wipers worn so to do this 

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:35.840
 you rise like those figs 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:38.479
 the 90 ° ace you switch to 90 ° also 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:39.679
 your windshield wipers and here you see it 

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:42.200
 there is a small tab to press 

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:42.410
 above and after you have to push the towel 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.119
 ice cream 

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:45.560
 all this being very careful because 

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:47.450
 there are plastic parts 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:48.979
 we should not break them so we 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:53.649
 do it with a lot of precaution we 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:57.380
 press the tab and in addition up 

00:01:53.649 --> 00:02:00.050
 we are pushing we are tipping our 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:01.060
 small beautiful and we remove so you see 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:03.979
 right here 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:05.629
 the wiper to a form of u so 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:07.009
 it's called u-shaped models 

00:02:05.629 --> 00:02:09.690
 or just because it's a form 

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:16.440
 in view so 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:18.910
 you change your ice up koné again 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:20.530
 then the new there is a tab 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:24.129
 protective that protects the straw 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:26.349
 plastic to control the wear indicator 

00:02:24.129 --> 00:02:28.629
 so it will take once the wipes 

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:31.480
 mounted ice cream remove this little bit of 

00:02:28.629 --> 00:02:34.269
 paper so you take the witness 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:35.680
 wear towards you towards the car in 

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:37.360
 made towards the interest of the car as 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:38.379
 that when you're at the inter of the 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:40.390
 car you can watch the witness 

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:43.959
 of wear and whether to change your 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:47.049
 wipers or not so you put the 

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:50.530
 moving part like these at an angle 

00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:53.769
 right and if there is a hole you go 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:55.450
 to penetrate the ass and then he 

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:57.010
 just do not push the party 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:57.670
 mobile so that it comes to snap 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:00.720
 in the u 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:04.660
 So I keep the moving part here 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:07.299
 and I drag it on the bus as 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:10.780
 these here and there I hold until his 

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:15.420
 clipse we heard the click 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:17.590
 these good handed our wipers 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:20.040
 And now, voila 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:22.540
 it only remains to remove the small 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:24.639
 bastide of protection see that it is 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:26.530
 very dark tell you what is new here is the to 

00:03:24.639 --> 00:03:29.819

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:29.819
