 a little bit simple on the red carpet strong 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:59.420

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:06.360
 just perfect 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.840
 For this kind of HDTV they were busy one can install 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.500
 the lower regions 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.130
 especially greenlings 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:15.700

 the public prosecutor you come from the region on justice to still be a man of a man 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.990
 using that new interface outside wippers the TV as a weapon was not yet 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:31.990
 something like that for your HDTV 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.180
 The channels that are very proud of market forces as it also serves 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:39.210
 can use other equipment 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.930
 and of course there are needed to clean up 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:43.340
 we were like the weather 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:44.810
 to provide power 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:49.100
 the body has it now goes for the pool of hd 7000 pig resort

 That means he is incredibly sharp 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:06.270
 no matter how this fall sits down, it just keeps on seeing details 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.630
 unimaginable this you have to see how you come to be able to press how sharp so 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:12.629
 dvz bizarre 

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:16.730
 well ultra this technique it is of course a good example of hd content 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:17.790
 to look up 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:22.620
 but pick it up further I assume that the notary I also sell very well 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:23.680
 plots 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:26.789

 and from jenny tanghe the other parent wants the dvd zz a comedian looking at your camera 

00:02:32.929 --> 00:02:36.939
 what tips courses are calculated in cannes pixels by the image so just 

00:02:36.939 --> 00:02:38.210
 becomes just as sharp 

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:40.970
 this kind of image wanted to be like four 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:45.680
 on such a TV you get disbelief about a super nice quality vehicle 

00:02:46.279 --> 00:02:50.389
 that the bulgarian clip insists that i have a wonderful contrast ratio rather all 

00:02:50.389 --> 00:02:53.389
 cases of wilders according to many on super clear 

00:02:54.419 --> 00:02:57.230

 sea ​​mergaerts mdm 

00:02:59.429 --> 00:03:02.899
 musician to be precise with movements with sport 

00:03:02.899 --> 00:03:07.209
 always everything incredibly sharp incredibly clairvoyant about the how then 

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:08.529
 also that they are the us 

00:03:08.529 --> 00:03:10.349
 mulder to fluent 

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:14.069
 That is an attempt for the rest of the bilt business with a bill 

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:15.629
 quad core processor and 

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:18.930
 then you know it is good for 10 euros, so it comes running then 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:21.589
 then looking is green black which 

00:03:21.589 --> 00:03:26.850

00:03:35.279 --> 00:03:38.989
 if you do not think that is enough, it is equipped with wifi and I have you there sometimes 

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:43.360
 a tumultuous the speakers ideally use the TV's wireless 

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:46.229
 and yet the sound stays everywhere in the house 

00:03:46.229 --> 00:03:47.329
 no problem 

00:03:47.329 --> 00:03:51.889
