00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.950 

saw<00:01:53.740> the<00:01:53.799> pattern<00:01:54.100> starts<00:01:54.759> by<00:01:54.999> playing<00:01:55.329> the<00:01:55.600> a

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:55.960 
saw the pattern starts by playing the a

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:00.059 
saw the pattern starts by playing the a
string<00:01:56.950> the<00:01:57.249> thumb<00:01:57.520> and<00:01:58.179> the<00:01:58.569> g<00:01:58.869> string<00:01:59.259> with

00:02:05.069 --> 00:02:05.079 
the first finger so the first part of

00:02:05.079 --> 00:02:10.540 
the first finger so the first part of
the<00:02:05.170> pattern<00:02:05.560> is<00:02:08.220> index

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:10.550

one little tip that will help you is
each<00:04:43.560> time<00:04:43.920> you<00:04:44.070> play<00:04:44.280> in<00:04:44.340> the<00:04:44.490> D<00:04:44.700> base<00:04:45.470> you're

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:46.470 
each time you play in the D base you're

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:48.790 
each time you play in the D base you're
going<00:04:46.500> to<00:04:46.710> be<00:04:46.800> following<00:04:46.980> it<00:04:47.310> by

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:48.800 
going to be following it by

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:52.980 
going to be following it by
the<00:04:49.360> middle<00:04:50.360> finger<00:04:50.690> playing<00:04:50.960> the<00:04:51.259> B<00:04:52.069> string

second string so it's always that
sequence<00:04:58.360> the<00:04:59.360> D<00:05:00.259> base<00:05:00.530> is<00:05:00.860> almost<00:05:01.160> followed

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:01.520 
sequence the D base is almost followed

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:03.249 
sequence the D base is almost followed
by<00:05:01.639> the<00:05:01.699> middle<00:05:02.090> finger<00:05:02.479> and<00:05:02.900> that'll<00:05:03.229> just

00:05:03.249 --> 00:05:03.259 
by the middle finger and that'll just

00:05:03.259 --> 00:05:05.080 
by the middle finger and that'll just
make<00:05:03.470> sure<00:05:03.800> that<00:05:04.009> you're<00:05:04.160> kept<00:05:04.340> in<00:05:04.520> sequence

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:05.090 
make sure that you're kept in sequence

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:16.010 
make sure that you're kept in sequence
and<00:05:05.509> let<00:05:05.720> you<00:05:05.840> pick<00:05:06.050> in

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:16.020 

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:25.490 

so<00:05:17.020> we<00:05:17.199> have<00:05:18.389> thumb<00:05:20.550> index<00:05:21.930> from<00:05:23.009> middle

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:25.500 
so we have thumb index from middle

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:32.630 
so we have thumb index from middle
phone<00:05:26.660> ring<00:05:29.750> middle<00:05:30.750> you<00:05:31.710> can<00:05:31.860> see<00:05:31.920> that<00:05:32.310> full

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:32.640 
phone ring middle you can see that full

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:35.060 
phone ring middle you can see that full
middle<00:05:33.360> each<00:05:33.750> time<00:05:34.020> we<00:05:34.140> play<00:05:34.290> like<00:05:34.560> debase

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:35.070 
middle each time we play like debase

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:37.430 
middle each time we play like debase
souls<00:05:35.730> followed<00:05:36.150> by<00:05:36.270> a<00:05:36.300> little<00:05:36.630> finger<00:05:36.810> and

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:37.440 
souls followed by a little finger and

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:40.100 
souls followed by a little finger and
then<00:05:38.100> you're<00:05:38.430> gonna<00:05:38.610> keep<00:05:38.820> it<00:05:39.060> in<00:05:39.480> sequence

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:40.110 
then you're gonna keep it in sequence

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:44.090 
then you're gonna keep it in sequence
with<00:05:40.290> you<00:05:40.410> pickin<00:05:41.240> so<00:05:42.240> the<00:05:42.690> pattern<00:05:43.080> is<00:05:43.200> played

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:44.100 
with you pickin so the pattern is played

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:47.180 
with you pickin so the pattern is played
nice<00:05:44.310> and<00:05:44.580> slowly<00:05:44.850> nice<00:05:45.240> and<00:05:45.510> even<00:05:45.750> way<00:05:46.190> with

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:47.190 
nice and slowly nice and even way with

nice and slowly nice and even way with
an<00:05:47.310> asked<00:05:47.670> or<00:05:47.850> you<00:05:48.440> get<00:05:50.120> index<00:05:53.750> ring<00:05:55.940> middle

00:05:57.670 --> 00:05:57.680 
an asked or you get index ring middle

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:00.500 
an asked or you get index ring middle
and<00:05:58.680> then<00:05:58.860> by<00:05:59.070> gradually<00:05:59.880> increasing<00:05:59.910> the

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:00.510 
and then by gradually increasing the

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:02.300 
and then by gradually increasing the
tempo<00:06:01.050> and<00:06:01.260> I<00:06:01.350> would<00:06:01.470> recommend<00:06:01.650> practicing

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:02.310 
tempo and I would recommend practicing

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:06.590 
tempo and I would recommend practicing
this<00:06:02.940> for<00:06:03.690> maybe<00:06:04.410> 10-15<00:06:05.310> minutes<00:06:05.670> each<00:06:06.210> day

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:06.600 
this for maybe 10-15 minutes each day

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:08.450 
this for maybe 10-15 minutes each day
and<00:06:06.810> by<00:06:06.930> the<00:06:06.990> end<00:06:07.230> of<00:06:07.410> a<00:06:07.830> couple<00:06:08.220> of<00:06:08.280> weeks

and by the end of a couple of weeks

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:11.360 
and by the end of a couple of weeks
practice<00:06:09.030> if<00:06:10.020> not<00:06:10.140> sooner<00:06:10.590> you<00:06:10.980> should<00:06:11.220> have<00:06:11.340> a
