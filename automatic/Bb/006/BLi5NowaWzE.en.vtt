of nutrition and today i'd like to talk
to<00:00:06.509> you<00:00:06.720> about<00:00:06.930> a<00:00:07.470> really<00:00:07.919> interesting<00:00:08.189> study

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:08.730 
to you about a really interesting study

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.490 
to you about a really interesting study
that<00:00:09.599> I'm<00:00:09.780> titling<00:00:10.170> when<00:00:10.950> vegans<00:00:11.460> eat<00:00:11.700> steak

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:12.500 
that I'm titling when vegans eat steak

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:15.169 
that I'm titling when vegans eat steak
so<00:00:13.500> we've<00:00:13.679> heard<00:00:13.889> for<00:00:14.099> years<00:00:14.549> that<00:00:14.969> the

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
so we've heard for years that the

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:17.330 
so we've heard for years that the
problem<00:00:15.780> with<00:00:16.109> eating<00:00:16.320> meats<00:00:16.740> is<00:00:17.039> the

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
problem with eating meats is the

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.400 
problem with eating meats is the
cholesterol<00:00:18.000> and<00:00:18.240> the<00:00:18.330> fat<00:00:18.600> that's<00:00:18.990> contained

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
cholesterol and the fat that's contained

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.070 
cholesterol and the fat that's contained
in<00:00:19.590> it<00:00:19.710> so<00:00:20.460> it<00:00:20.939> would<00:00:21.150> stand<00:00:21.330> to<00:00:21.600> reason<00:00:21.720> if

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
in it so it would stand to reason if

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.990 
in it so it would stand to reason if
that's<00:00:22.260> the<00:00:22.410> problem<00:00:22.680> then<00:00:23.250> we<00:00:23.279> can<00:00:23.490> solve<00:00:23.760> it

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
that's the problem then we can solve it

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.570 
that's the problem then we can solve it
by<00:00:24.210> eating<00:00:24.390> lean<00:00:24.750> cuts<00:00:25.109> of<00:00:25.260> meat<00:00:25.500> however<00:00:26.340> this

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
by eating lean cuts of meat however this

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.490 
by eating lean cuts of meat however this
study<00:00:26.910> shows<00:00:27.240> that<00:00:27.300> it's<00:00:27.689> not<00:00:27.869> that<00:00:28.140> simple

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
study shows that it's not that simple

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.420 
study shows that it's not that simple
and<00:00:28.949> the<00:00:29.699> reason<00:00:29.880> is<00:00:30.179> this<00:00:30.359> new<00:00:30.630> chemical<00:00:31.430> TMAO

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
and the reason is this new chemical TMAO

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.139 
and the reason is this new chemical TMAO
new<00:00:33.090> to<00:00:33.300> us<00:00:33.710> trimethylamine<00:00:34.820> n-oxide<00:00:35.820> can

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
encourage the growth of fatty deposits

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:39.740

on the walls of arteries now here's
where<00:00:39.930> it<00:00:39.989> gets<00:00:40.050> interesting<00:00:41.000> the<00:00:42.000> study

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
where it gets interesting the study

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.560 
where it gets interesting the study
compared<00:00:43.230> meat-eaters<00:00:44.100> and<00:00:44.390> vegetarians<00:00:45.390> and

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
compared meat-eaters and vegetarians and

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:50.020 
compared meat-eaters and vegetarians and
vegans<00:00:45.829> in<00:00:46.829> whether<00:00:47.820> the<00:00:48.090> TMAO<00:00:48.780> spiked<00:00:49.440> after

vegans in whether the TMAO spiked after

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:54.229 
vegans in whether the TMAO spiked after
eating<00:00:51.030> meat<00:00:51.390> and<00:00:51.949> it<00:00:52.949> found<00:00:53.250> that<00:00:53.399> a<00:00:53.670> vegan

eating meat and it found that a vegan
did<00:00:54.750> not<00:00:54.960> show<00:00:55.260> the<00:00:55.440> same<00:00:55.680> spike<00:00:56.129> in<00:00:56.340> levels<00:00:56.670> of

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
did not show the same spike in levels of

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.229 
did not show the same spike in levels of
TMAO<00:00:57.480> after<00:00:58.140> eating<00:00:58.320> a<00:00:58.500> 200<00:00:59.340> gram<00:00:59.640> sirloin

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.990 
steak in other words what they ate was
less<00:01:03.809> important<00:01:04.470> than<00:01:04.680> how<00:01:05.400> they<00:01:05.430> had<00:01:05.790> been

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
less important than how they had been

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.600 
less important than how they had been
eating<00:01:06.420> in<00:01:06.570> the<00:01:06.689> past<00:01:06.930> and<00:01:07.439> the<00:01:08.100> analysis

eating in the past and the analysis

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.190 
eating in the past and the analysis
showed<00:01:08.850> that<00:01:08.880> the<00:01:09.090> vegans<00:01:09.420> and<00:01:09.510> vegetarians

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
showed that the vegans and vegetarians

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.170 
showed that the vegans and vegetarians
had<00:01:10.439> quote<00:01:10.799> very<00:01:11.159> different<00:01:11.729> types<00:01:11.970> of

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.980 
chief researcher on this study concluded
that<00:01:19.560> eating<00:01:19.950> meet<00:01:20.130> regularly<00:01:20.780> promotes<00:01:21.780> the

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
that eating meet regularly promotes the

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.649 
that eating meet regularly promotes the

carnitine in red meat into TMAO and the

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.499 
carnitine in red meat into TMAO and the
thing<00:01:29.340> about<00:01:29.369> TMAO<00:01:30.240> is<00:01:30.659> that<00:01:31.140> it<00:01:31.409> leads<00:01:31.829> to

00:01:32.499 --> 00:01:32.509 
thing about TMAO is that it leads to

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:37.130 
thing about TMAO is that it leads to
deposits<00:01:33.509> on<00:01:33.829> arterial<00:01:34.829> walls<00:01:35.570> so<00:01:36.570> carnitine

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
deposits on arterial walls so carnitine

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.890 
deposits on arterial walls so carnitine
on<00:01:37.320> its<00:01:37.500> own<00:01:37.710> didn't<00:01:38.520> seem<00:01:38.759> to<00:01:39.090> cause<00:01:39.659> the

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
on its own didn't seem to cause the

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.230 
on its own didn't seem to cause the
problem<00:01:40.380> but<00:01:40.770> when<00:01:40.920> we<00:01:41.040> combined<00:01:41.520> with<00:01:41.700> TMAO

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
problem but when we combined with TMAO

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.940 
problem but when we combined with TMAO
it<00:01:42.540> turned<00:01:42.780> people<00:01:42.960> into<00:01:43.200> quote<00:01:43.560> prime

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
it turned people into quote prime

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.609 
it turned people into quote prime

targets for heart disease the first

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:50.590 
targets for heart disease the first
point<00:01:46.979> is<00:01:47.189> that<00:01:47.960> nutrition<00:01:48.960> is<00:01:49.110> complex<00:01:49.799> it<00:01:50.100> is

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:50.600 
point is that nutrition is complex it is

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:55.069 
point is that nutrition is complex it is
jaw-droppingly<00:01:51.600> complex<00:01:52.500> and<00:01:53.720> we're<00:01:54.720> used<00:01:54.960> to

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
jaw-droppingly complex and we're used to

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:56.420 
jaw-droppingly complex and we're used to
thinking<00:01:55.259> about<00:01:55.560> nutrition<00:01:56.100> the<00:01:56.189> way<00:01:56.310> we

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
thinking about nutrition the way we

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:57.620 
thinking about nutrition the way we
might<00:01:56.579> have<00:01:56.729> learned<00:01:56.820> it<00:01:57.030> in<00:01:57.119> school<00:01:57.149> like

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
might have learned it in school like

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.530 
might have learned it in school like

carrots so you can see well and that
everything<00:02:02.909> we<00:02:03.210> eat<00:02:03.240> is<00:02:04.219> reducible<00:02:05.219> to<00:02:05.549> a

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
everything we eat is reducible to a

cholesterol and saturated fat were just

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:11.670

ride<00:05:11.770> and<00:05:12.340> then<00:05:12.789> and<00:05:13.180> we<00:05:13.330> kind<00:05:13.659> of<00:05:13.689> got<00:05:13.840> it

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:14.020 
ride and then and we kind of got it

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:15.600 
ride and then and we kind of got it
wrong<00:05:14.199> and<00:05:14.529> so<00:05:14.680> we<00:05:14.770> should<00:05:14.949> be<00:05:15.099> welcoming

those back into our diet another

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:20.010 
those back into our diet another
possibility<00:05:18.310> is<00:05:18.490> it's<00:05:18.729> the<00:05:18.849> carnitine<00:05:19.449> that

possibility is it's the carnitine that
causes<00:05:20.469> heart<00:05:20.710> disease<00:05:20.740> and<00:05:21.960> we<00:05:22.960> saw<00:05:23.259> here

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:23.560 
causes heart disease and we saw here

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:25.469 
causes heart disease and we saw here
that<00:05:23.770> carnitine<00:05:24.219> doesn't<00:05:24.610> seem<00:05:24.789> to<00:05:24.969> directly

00:05:25.469 --> 00:05:25.479 
that carnitine doesn't seem to directly

lead to heart disease but it needs to be
