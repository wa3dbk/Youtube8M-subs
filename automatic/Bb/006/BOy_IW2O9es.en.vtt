00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:08.860
 others lived very badly lacked the most 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:11.620
 basic clothing stuff 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:14.860
 but parents helped us to be good 

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:19.150
 went to school went and here it is 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:21.670
 the shortage of everything I grew up and was since childhood 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:24.100
 great desire to help my parents 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:25.510
 little brothers sisters that is understandable 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:28.030
 strangers topic of the week 

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:30.880
 so despite the fact that I am honors 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:32.620
 I finished school I wanted to work 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:35.170
 for work 

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:37.370
 on the one hand and on the other hand 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:38.870
 patriotic appeal was new 

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:41.780
 metallurgical plant in the center 

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:43.990
 Kazakhstan was created like how 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:47.030
 youths can do something like that 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:51.020
 leave home far away and prove yourself 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:52.880
 what i'm worth and so i hit an 18 year old 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:55.940
 aged at a metallurgical plant 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:59.270
 who knows this is very hard work in 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:02.830
 1 rural boy get used to 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:06.350
 huge empty where the temperature of the metal 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:09.110
 1500 degrees pressure units there 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:11.780
 several atmospheres polluted 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:14.330
 Napoleon need to work with a shovel scrap 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:15.440
 it's not easy in rural hardening 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:17.670
 of course helped 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:20.370
 so 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:21.330
 can i say i origin of rural 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:24.900
 and 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:26.610
 the origins of working i youth always 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:29.069
 I say that any 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:34.770
 chosen profession must try 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:37.760
 reach 6 years after working more than have 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:40.860
 I have known all sides for ten years 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:43.470
 economy in general which exists and 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:46.890
 it still helps me first 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:49.440
 second I worked multinational 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:52.140
 collective average workers i still 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:54.720
 when I make a decision I start thinking about 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:56.610
 that here it will give this simple man 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:59.819
 I never thought that I would be 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:02.160
 President I just worked I dreamed 

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:05.040
 to become a metallurgist at first I wanted to be 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:07.830
 a pilot but these plans are changing lives 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:10.049
 changes then I became a metallurgist I 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:13.140
 I thought that I would be well known 

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:15.420
 metallurgist but since I am very good 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:17.790
 see worked was a famous person 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:20.549
 I was promoted to Komsomol work 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:23.510
 on party work and on those jobs 

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:29.070
 I also tried to do everything right 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:31.290
 so work work on yourself and love 

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:35.299
 the thing you always do 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:35.299
 man will bring to the surface
