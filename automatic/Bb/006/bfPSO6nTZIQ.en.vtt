 just like you had a difficult week 

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:25.770
 I'm made by what I got to see 

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:29.870
 a little bit because of the panic face that the 

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:34.800
 final you forgot how much the 

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:37.080
 under is that you have all without help 

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:40.520
 truth in borriol and warnings at the end of 

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:40.520
 the song that happened 

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:49.240
 eskenazi the terminal and the strict the 

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:53.020
 problem because of the scary face that follows 

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:53.020
 it's good 

00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:00.160
 that 

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:06.190
 I have a lot of confidence in what you do 

00:06:04.139 --> 00:06:08.320

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:11.440
 I like to see you on stage and I 

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:13.510
 you make the day but you can not trust 

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:16.090

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:18.450
 ears and you know what a milestone of 

00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:18.450
 ears 

00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:26.330

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:31.940
 little one and work a lot 

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:31.940
 but I'm going to give 

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:42.060
 what are you going to give him is still the taste you are the 

00:06:40.890 --> 00:06:44.130
 smaller where you can trust 

00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:46.320

00:06:44.130 --> 00:06:47.650
 you want to pay attention to the teachers that 

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:51.030
 mouth 

00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:51.030
 and by ignoring 

00:06:52.630 --> 00:06:57.330
 is skillful 

00:06:54.720 --> 00:07:00.180
 It is acute to be waiting for the 

00:06:57.330 --> 00:07:02.400
 final decision but 6 something told you what 

00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:03.990
