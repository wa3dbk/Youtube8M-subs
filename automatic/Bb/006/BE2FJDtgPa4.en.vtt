00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:17.820
 hello, my personal goal to show you 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:19.800
 Are you giving an answer is that video? 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.900
 first video I did other than myself 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:26.010
 I already sold in that video. 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:29.400
 I always said I was a challenge. 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:31.650
 to lose five kilos 15 days who sees 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.809
 video and I have to give a 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:37.170
 reply to you this video and 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:39.210
 I really got to lose two pounds 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.699
 I found very little because my detention 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:44.670
 five kilos but I found it a lot 

00:00:41.699 --> 00:00:47.940
 interesting because I missed measurements 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:50.969
 so it was not just the weight loss it is 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.739
 You can not take measures and this for me. 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:54.329
 It was really cool because I did not do a 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:57.030
 physical effort did not do physical activity 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:59.489
 not because you do not want to actually do it 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.420
 I do not have time to do activity 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.359
 physics 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:06.500
 So I saw him, I wanted to make a 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:09.180
 actually testing how it would be 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.409
 other alternatives to achieve this 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.900
 same goal 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:15.230
 so I keep on taking it as well 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:19.050
 said my blog I have more this one has 

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:22.980
 bust that I put there saying the 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:25.830
 answers I had and still continue 

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:28.560
 doing is this change 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:31.020
 I'll show you some soon 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:34.560
 Passing yourself tips that's for 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:37.560
 make this wall here that I created 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:40.220
 That was it, I want to make a 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:43.200
 different thing and then it was cool 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:45.180
 So I'm going to teach you how to 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:49.110
 and walls and other tips do you 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:51.120
 even then there remains my blog 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:53.700
 Take a look, sweet side and I'll wait. 

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:57.860
 that you like and cut 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:02:00.120
 Did you like kurt and you both? 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:02.220
 I would like to have tea 

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:04.700
 it does not taste very good but it is 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:07.700
 very cool and is a result 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:10.069
 Sandy and he help also did not speak of in 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:12.800
 In general, not only the question of 

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:16.430
 weight loss but shimo luti da 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:18.769
 energy is slight metabolism among others 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:21.260
 things not to speculate my course 

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:24.310
 Okay, big kiss, you two already had 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.310
 staff since
