thinners soaked rag and it will come off
straight<00:03:23.850> away<00:03:23.880> okay<00:03:24.780> so<00:03:24.840> while<00:03:25.140> such<00:03:25.350> drying

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:06.570 
this alloy frame I'm not a massive fan

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:08.030 
this alloy frame I'm not a massive fan
that<00:04:06.750> polish<00:04:07.049> frames<00:04:07.320> I've<00:04:07.500> got<00:04:07.650> to<00:04:07.739> be<00:04:07.860> honest

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:12.350 
so I'm going to use a nylon pad and some
metal<00:04:10.769> polish<00:04:11.040> like<00:04:11.220> this<00:04:11.430> just<00:04:12.090> to<00:04:12.150> try<00:04:12.329> and

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:12.360 
metal polish like this just to try and

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:14.780 
metal polish like this just to try and
get<00:04:12.540> a<00:04:12.600> semi<00:04:13.170> satin<00:04:13.799> finish<00:04:14.190> when<00:04:14.670> you're

using<00:04:15.030> a<00:04:15.209> scarer<00:04:15.570> it<00:04:15.810> will<00:04:16.019> mark<00:04:16.290> the<00:04:16.530> alloys

00:04:16.819 --> 00:04:16.829 
using a scarer it will mark the alloys

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:18.380 
using a scarer it will mark the alloys
so<00:04:17.070> you<00:04:17.130> need<00:04:17.340> to<00:04:17.459> polish<00:04:17.700> it<00:04:17.880> in<00:04:18.000> a<00:04:18.060> single

direction like this you can use a soft

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:22.550 
direction like this you can use a soft
brush<00:04:20.820> on<00:04:21.060> casts<00:04:21.630> or<00:04:21.750> rough<00:04:21.959> parts<00:04:22.320> to<00:04:22.440> get

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:22.560 
brush on casts or rough parts to get

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:24.650 
brush on casts or rough parts to get
into<00:04:22.830> all<00:04:22.919> the<00:04:23.010> crevices<00:04:23.220> now<00:04:24.150> just<00:04:24.450> like<00:04:24.630> the

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:24.660 
into all the crevices now just like the

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:26.570 
into all the crevices now just like the
frame<00:04:24.960> the<00:04:25.140> exhaust<00:04:25.500> counter<00:04:25.919> has<00:04:26.010> also<00:04:26.250> been

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:26.580

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:31.570 
use a nylon Skara on that to again work

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:33.270 
use a nylon Skara on that to again work
the<00:04:31.750> polish<00:04:32.080> in<00:04:32.260> the<00:04:32.320> direction<00:04:32.710> of<00:04:32.890> the<00:04:33.010> part

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:33.280 
the polish in the direction of the part

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:35.640 
the polish in the direction of the part
you're<00:04:33.430> polishing<00:04:34.120> and<00:04:34.270> try<00:04:34.900> to<00:04:34.960> use<00:04:35.350> long

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:35.650 
you're polishing and try to use long

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:38.220 
you're polishing and try to use long
strokes<00:04:36.100> like<00:04:36.310> this<00:04:36.370> wherever<00:04:37.030> possible<00:04:37.300> when

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:38.230 
strokes like this wherever possible when

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:39.990 
strokes like this wherever possible when
you're<00:04:38.380> buffing<00:04:38.830> off<00:04:39.040> keep<00:04:39.400> changing<00:04:39.910> the

you're buffing off keep changing the
cloth<00:04:40.180> around<00:04:40.360> so<00:04:40.750> you<00:04:40.840> don't<00:04:41.020> just<00:04:41.080> keep

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:41.380 
cloth around so you don't just keep

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:43.920 
cloth around so you don't just keep
spreading<00:04:41.860> the<00:04:42.160> old<00:04:42.280> polish<00:04:42.670> around<00:04:42.940> and<00:04:43.270> as<00:04:43.900> a

spreading the old polish around and as a

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:45.810 
spreading the old polish around and as a
point<00:04:44.170> of<00:04:44.350> interest<00:04:44.650> the<00:04:45.190> bit<00:04:45.400> on<00:04:45.430> the<00:04:45.580> right

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:45.820 
point of interest the bit on the right

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:47.700 
point of interest the bit on the right
has<00:04:46.060> been<00:04:46.240> polished<00:04:46.450> with<00:04:46.750> a<00:04:46.780> cloth<00:04:47.110> and<00:04:47.380> the

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:47.710 
has been polished with a cloth and the

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:49.380 
has been polished with a cloth and the
bit<00:04:47.890> on<00:04:48.070> the<00:04:48.160> left<00:04:48.460> has<00:04:48.700> been<00:04:48.850> polished<00:04:49.240> with<00:04:49.360> a

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:49.390 
bit on the left has been polished with a

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:51.030 
bit on the left has been polished with a
scarer<00:04:49.810> so<00:04:50.290> you<00:04:50.350> can<00:04:50.500> really<00:04:50.800> see<00:04:50.920> the

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:51.040 
scarer so you can really see the

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:53.910 
scarer so you can really see the
difference<00:04:51.190> in<00:04:51.550> finish
