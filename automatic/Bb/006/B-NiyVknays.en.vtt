00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:06.359
 when it crashes and rumbles properly 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:08.460
 then actually only robots in the 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:10.320
 be a game and when it comes to robots 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.719
 It's almost game then 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.340
 always the transformers now they are 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.590
 back in her new game sinking 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.420
 cybertron states that it is the 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.490
 official successor to fight over 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.730
 cybertron like that 's the one we betrayed 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.730
 you now 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:40.270
 fight for cybertron was actually 

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:42.010
 a pretty surprise than the one before 

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:44.500
 Two years later we all thought 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:46.810
 whether that will be just as a license scrap 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:48.910
 we usually always come and he was 

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:50.260
 it was not worth it with georg 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:52.090
 robots moving in vehicles 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:55.390
 can transform with a relative 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:58.150
 short campaign with a relative okay 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:01:00.220
 story but very varied 

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:02.470
 missions by always new ones 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:04.089
 Robot could play that too 

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:05.620
 basically not changed that applies to 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:08.350
 the positive and the negative aspects 

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:11.380
 Downing concerts is just as short 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:13.090
 are 13 missions if you let me 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:14.350
 do not lie to no more than six 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:17.800
 hours 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:20.470
 And there is still no story like that 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:21.970
 you must have heard it goes 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:23.740
 to any secret in aragon 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:24.490
 reserves the transformers need 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:26.680
 to survive 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:29.020
 it's about an interstellar space 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:30.400
 portal the transformers to one 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:32.140
 could bring new planet 

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:33.310
 it's about insect robots it's about 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:35.560
 the dinosaur robot is all about 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:37.540
 giant robot that's a whole lot 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:39.340
 and frankly more 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:42.159
 confused than that there is more tension 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:43.210
 would have forced if you do not 

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:44.740
 now what was actually asking 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:46.630
 assets of history would have been and 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:47.830
 what the outcome is, I can 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:49.780
 do not tell you 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:51.490
 Renewals are also available 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:53.140
 kept completely in one set themselves 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:55.060
 lately the weapons can be used 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:56.950
 also you can upgrade to new 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:58.990
 To buy one can also perks 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:01.450
 You can buy it anywhere in the world 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:04.000
 level small energies later the one 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:06.159
 then redeem at arms terminals 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.649
 to improve his weapons is whole 

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:09.670
 nice is relatively motivating now 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:11.410
 the voltage curve but not synonymous 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:13.000
 necessarily high what the voltage curve 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:15.730
 instead holds up the change 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.410
 I play in it like totally if promotion 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:19.390
 you have a new transformer at hand 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:20.980
 and they can all do what 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:23.410
 different things that is the 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:26.500
 A can sneak stream for example 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:27.519
 can fly so cool it does 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.799
 whole a bit more varied 

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:30.880
 for the short time as it is but is 

00:02:29.799 --> 00:02:32.140
 not really different because of it 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:32.980
 first part I would have already brought 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:34.390
 and there we are, I believe 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:36.730
 main problem of the downfall of cybertron 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:38.739
 it is first again it is 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:40.180
 the same result as the first one in 

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:41.380
 So you have to say that you have the reason 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:42.850
 you played first part you can 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:45.370
 almost save it 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:47.020
 Spend 60 euros at the same game 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:48.460
 You do not have to have it again 

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:49.390
 it's definitely graphically 

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:51.820
 a little bit polished 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:53.710
 that means the surroundings are simple 

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:55.930
 again bigger cybertron was already in the 

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:58.090
 first part of a huge structure 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:00.820
 dirt and metal and now it is 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:02.590
 so you fly through levels which are easy 

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:04.270
 gigantic and standing in the background 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:06.450
 huge robots and fight each other there 

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:08.530
 Above is a battle where there are little ones 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:10.600
 Space glider shoot 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:13.180
 that's totally awesome exploded everywhere 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:14.650
 What is better than it? 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:17.350
 Michael who could ever do it 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:19.210
 graphically that is unfortunately relatively dirty 

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:20.590
 the textures are relatively weak 

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:22.270
 sometimes takes the epik 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:23.980
 because if such a huge robot 

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:25.300
 dinosaur comes into the picture and then it is 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:25.870
 but only gray and pretty 

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:28.690
 wishy-washy 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:30.250
 we were still awestruck 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:32.350
 missing are two things in the first 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:34.690
 Partly there were still pretty cool ones 

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:36.460
 Two bosses fights were indeed 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:38.920
 but only now is it really 

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:41.320
 almost no more than a few 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:43.750
 small intermezzi denies the track 

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:45.850
 what is more is that the 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:47.230
 vehicles are not like now 

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:48.190
 more oberbauer that was a problem in the 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:49.480
 first part because if you are in the 

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:50.500
 you have transformed vehicle 

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:51.850
 almost invincible 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:53.650
 that is not so you can now 

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:55.120
 also be hurt but if you 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:56.740
 honestly that takes the whole too 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:58.210
 the sense because why should I 

00:03:56.740 --> 00:04:01.030
 actually turn into vehicle than 

00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:02.560
 Optimus prime if I walk a lot 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:03.790
 If I am more agile by doing so 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:05.410
 if i also have more skills 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:06.730
 can use because the secondary 

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:07.960
 skills of all robots that one can 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:08.530
 I can not just walk everybody 

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:10.960
 use 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:12.010
 So do not make much sense and lets 

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:14.260
 This feature is actually pretty 

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:18.690
 stupid stand by so you have to 

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:18.690
 say this is a design flaw 

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:35.770
 so the question remains how good is 

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:37.930
 sinking of cybertron and can do so 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:39.610
 I just say you have to fight 

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:41.439
 cybertron played then you have in 

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:43.270
 Found everything for much more 

00:04:41.439 --> 00:04:45.340
 Unfortunately, cybertron's demise too 

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:47.590
 it is not a good action game that 

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:49.449
 fun makes that but actually one is 

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:51.069
 What you play in the summer hole at most 

00:04:49.449 --> 00:04:52.840
 I would go to your place 

00:04:51.069 --> 00:04:54.430
 Guessing may be waiting for you 

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:56.349
 a little cheaper on the games for 

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:58.060
 to have family or get the 

00:04:56.349 --> 00:04:59.800
 first part of the overall I find one 

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:02.860
 Pieces better than the second part 

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:04.810
 the multiplayer mode is good but is 

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:06.219
 even in comparison to the first part not 

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:08.409
 not much better 

00:05:06.219 --> 00:05:10.240
 So you can do it at a game time 

00:05:08.409 --> 00:05:11.889
 of six hours is a price of 60 

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:14.490
 euro, of course, a nice bunch 

00:05:11.889 --> 00:05:16.990
 I give 80 percent because it is one 

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:19.120
 Transformers play a really good game 

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:20.949
 example is surprise it has 

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:21.520
 It has insects and huge dinosaurs 

00:05:20.949 --> 00:05:23.020
 spaceships 

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:25.810
 that should be cool in any case 

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:27.129
 If you are a gamer and you are what you are 

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:28.870
 many of you are likely to be 

00:05:27.129 --> 00:05:30.400
 so try that out though 

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:31.599
 maybe not necessarily for 60 euros 

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:33.460
 maybe we can you in this 

00:05:31.599 --> 00:05:34.900
 Situation also help because those who are not 60 

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:36.729
 wants to spend euro gets the thing 

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:39.250
 simply with us we are giving away again 

00:05:36.729 --> 00:05:40.690
 once the pc version and you can 

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:42.969
 Just join in by the bottom 

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:45.789
 Write in comments and says there 

00:05:42.969 --> 00:05:46.719
 you what you want can also be quiet 

00:05:45.789 --> 00:05:49.860
 be nonsense 

00:05:46.719 --> 00:05:49.860
 Until next time 

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:15.950
 lukas fries the pros new press 

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:22.820
 see you soon 

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:25.270
 above the ground must 

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:25.270
 14
