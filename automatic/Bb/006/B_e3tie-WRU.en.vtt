00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.699
 hello I am today in company 

00:00:13.539 --> 00:00:17.080
 from nicolas barriquand hello you are 

00:00:15.699 --> 00:00:18.970
 security expert or sheep 

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:20.830
 so today we will talk gillet 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:23.170
 so you will introduce yourself two 

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:24.550
 models the hydrostatic vest and the 

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:26.860
 vest cellulose pellets 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:27.960
 let's start right away with the vest 

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:30.610
 hydrostatic 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.230
 it's a vest that goes off with the 

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:34.090
 hydrostatic system which works to 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:36.550
 the pressure then the system has to be 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:39.129
 submerged to 10 cm under water at this time 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:41.350
 there water comes under pressure on a 

00:00:39.129 --> 00:00:43.479
 membrane which triggered the mechanism 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:46.629
 who will hit the bottle it's a 

00:00:43.479 --> 00:00:48.940
 180 Newton vest the standard is at 150 

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:50.859
 newton minimum and to have more 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:53.319
 buoyancy we propose a net to 180 

00:00:50.859 --> 00:00:55.960
 newton this wii vest also has some 

00:00:53.319 --> 00:00:57.159
 comfort accessories like the collar in 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:58.960
 fleece that we see here that is removable 

00:00:57.159 --> 00:01:02.049
 to be machine wash or 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:04.449
 dried next to it and a double shoulder straps 

00:01:02.049 --> 00:01:06.850
 in the back with a mesh back for the 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:08.829
 a good fit on the shoulders a 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:10.960
 mouse talent that is a standard on the 

00:01:08.829 --> 00:01:12.659
 super vest so here we just watch 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:15.130
 the hydrostatic model 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:17.920
 I heard about some of 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:22.420
 those who say they are or we propose 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:26.100
 another model a trigger with 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:26.100
 a cellulose pellet 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:35.120
 compared to the other this one is 

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:37.250
 triggers how we do 

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:38.960
 then it is a hydro sensitive element 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:40.700
 so the cellulose that is inside 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:42.500
 of the cylinder will dissolve on contact 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:44.300
 of water that will release the mechanism 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:46.580
 to send them that will strike the 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:49.040
 bottle then sent the air to 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:52.340
 the inside of the room on this vest 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:02:00.320
 the the room the protection is 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:02:01.370
 solidarity with the gillette as well as on the 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:02.660
 hydrostatic system 

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:04.460
 we also have the possibility of a 

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:08.290
 manual trigger by pulling on the 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:08.290
 tongue or mouth inflation 

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:13.430
 with the lull that is here 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:16.910
 okay one of the interests of this vest there 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:19.010
 it's the ease of folding and the 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:20.750
 easy access to kits the advantage of 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:22.460
 hydrostatic system we saw first 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:25.280
 it is that it avoids the triggers 

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:27.770
 untimely okay for children 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:29.810
 we have the choice between the two then for 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:32.330
 children is models with 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:34.459
 smaller sizes that range from 18 to 40 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:37.250
 kg and it's still a system to 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:40.070
 cellulose pastilles super good ben 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:42.970
 while I choose now it's 

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:42.970
