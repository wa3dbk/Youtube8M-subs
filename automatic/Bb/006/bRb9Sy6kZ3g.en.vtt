decent fun but they're not the main draw
for<00:02:41.810> me<00:02:41.930> the<00:02:42.380> modern<00:02:42.740> games<00:02:42.950> on<00:02:43.130> the<00:02:43.220> other

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:43.340 
for me the modern games on the other

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:46.060 
for me the modern games on the other
hand<00:02:43.580> are<00:02:43.880> graphical<00:02:44.750> and<00:02:45.020> gameplay<00:02:45.560> upgrades

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:46.070 
hand are graphical and gameplay upgrades

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:48.370 
hand are graphical and gameplay upgrades
the<00:02:46.400> originals<00:02:46.940> making<00:02:47.660> them<00:02:47.810> much<00:02:48.050> more

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:48.380 
the originals making them much more

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:50.980 
the originals making them much more
interesting<00:02:49.180> but<00:02:50.180> even<00:02:50.420> though<00:02:50.540> they<00:02:50.720> have

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:50.990 
interesting but even though they have

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:53.290 
interesting but even though they have
been<00:02:51.260> updated<00:02:51.440> they're<00:02:52.160> still<00:02:52.490> very<00:02:52.700> basic

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:53.300 
been updated they're still very basic

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:55.360 
been updated they're still very basic
but<00:02:53.510> that's<00:02:54.110> sort<00:02:54.440> of<00:02:54.530> what<00:02:54.740> makes<00:02:54.920> them<00:02:55.100> fun

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:55.370 
but that's sort of what makes them fun

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:59.380 
but that's sort of what makes them fun
so<00:02:56.360> let's<00:02:56.570> look<00:02:56.690> at<00:02:56.840> them<00:02:56.990> now<00:02:57.170> one<00:02:57.560> by<00:02:57.740> one<00:02:58.390> the

00:02:59.380 --> 00:02:59.390 
so let's look at them now one by one the

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:01.960 
so let's look at them now one by one the
first<00:02:59.660> game<00:02:59.960> is<00:03:00.140> manhole<00:03:00.740> the<00:03:01.370> object<00:03:01.760> of<00:03:01.850> the

first game is manhole the object of the
game<00:03:02.000> is<00:03:02.180> to<00:03:02.390> keep<00:03:02.510> the<00:03:02.780> platforms<00:03:03.410> which<00:03:03.650> I

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:03.920 
game is to keep the platforms which I

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:05.770 
game is to keep the platforms which I
guess<00:03:04.280> are<00:03:04.460> supposed<00:03:04.790> to<00:03:04.850> be<00:03:05.000> manhole<00:03:05.420> covers

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:05.780 
guess are supposed to be manhole covers

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:08.410 
guess are supposed to be manhole covers
in<00:03:06.290> place<00:03:06.740> as<00:03:07.010> the<00:03:07.340> people<00:03:07.640> walk<00:03:07.820> across<00:03:08.090> them

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:34.070 
next up is fire the game works like this

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:53.410 
thing that makes this game hard is that
each<00:03:51.920> type<00:03:52.220> of<00:03:52.400> character<00:03:52.760> has<00:03:52.970> a<00:03:53.000> different

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:53.420 
each type of character has a different

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:55.690 
each type of character has a different
bounce<00:03:53.600> height<00:03:53.870> so<00:03:54.590> before<00:03:54.770> long<00:03:55.220> this<00:03:55.490> game

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:55.700 
bounce height so before long this game

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:58.090 
bounce height so before long this game
becomes<00:03:56.060> a<00:03:56.210> lot<00:03:56.510> like<00:03:56.720> juggling<00:03:57.020> and<00:03:57.380> orange<00:03:57.920> a

00:03:58.090 --> 00:03:58.100 
becomes a lot like juggling and orange a

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:00.280 
becomes a lot like juggling and orange a
ping-pong<00:03:58.460> ball<00:03:58.700> and<00:03:59.150> a<00:03:59.270> bowling<00:03:59.630> ball<00:03:59.780> all<00:04:00.050> at

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:00.290 
ping-pong ball and a bowling ball all at

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:03.100 
ping-pong ball and a bowling ball all at
once<00:04:00.430> it<00:04:01.430> gets<00:04:01.670> really<00:04:01.880> hectic<00:04:02.180> and<00:04:02.540> honestly

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:03.110 
once it gets really hectic and honestly

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:05.740 
once it gets really hectic and honestly
I'm<00:04:03.350> not<00:04:03.410> very<00:04:03.740> good<00:04:03.890> at<00:04:04.130> this<00:04:04.160> one<00:04:04.490> on<00:04:05.300> a<00:04:05.450> side

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:05.750 
I'm not very good at this one on a side

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:07.330 
I'm not very good at this one on a side
note<00:04:05.780> i'm<00:04:06.200> not<00:04:06.590> good<00:04:06.740> at<00:04:06.770> juggling<00:04:07.040> and

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:07.340 
note i'm not good at juggling and

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:09.820 
note i'm not good at juggling and
realize<00:04:07.700> either<00:04:07.970> so<00:04:08.780> maybe<00:04:08.960> this<00:04:09.230> one<00:04:09.620> just

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:09.830 
realize either so maybe this one just

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:12.040 
realize either so maybe this one just
isn't<00:04:10.190> for<00:04:10.340> me<00:04:10.400> i<00:04:10.670> still<00:04:11.450> think<00:04:11.570> it's<00:04:11.780> fun<00:04:11.930> to

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:12.050 
isn't for me i still think it's fun to

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:14.320 
isn't for me i still think it's fun to
see<00:04:12.230> how<00:04:12.350> well<00:04:12.530> i<00:04:12.590> can<00:04:12.680> do<00:04:13.010> but<00:04:13.640> so<00:04:13.820> far<00:04:14.000> my<00:04:14.150> best

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:14.330 
see how well i can do but so far my best

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:16.990 
see how well i can do but so far my best
score<00:04:14.630> is<00:04:14.810> a<00:04:14.840> hundred<00:04:15.200> and<00:04:15.290> eighty-six<00:04:16.000> this

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:17.000 
score is a hundred and eighty-six this

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.180 
score is a hundred and eighty-six this
game<00:04:17.210> is<00:04:17.359> actually<00:04:17.840> very<00:04:17.870> popular<00:04:18.799> and<00:04:19.010> has

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:19.190 
game is actually very popular and has

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:20.860

been cloned many times over the years

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:22.960 
been cloned many times over the years
the<00:04:21.770> first<00:04:22.010> one<00:04:22.160> that<00:04:22.250> came<00:04:22.400> to<00:04:22.550> mind<00:04:22.700> for<00:04:22.910> me

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:22.970 
the first one that came to mind for me

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:24.760 
the first one that came to mind for me
was<00:04:23.300> earthworm<00:04:23.840> jim<00:04:24.080> to

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:24.770 
was earthworm jim to

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:26.350 
was earthworm jim to
where<00:04:25.039> you<00:04:25.129> had<00:04:25.310> to<00:04:25.400> bounce<00:04:25.550> the<00:04:25.789> puppies<00:04:26.180> on

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:26.360 
where you had to bounce the puppies on

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:28.240 
where you had to bounce the puppies on
the<00:04:26.449> marshmallows<00:04:27.050> but<00:04:27.740> i'm<00:04:27.860> sure<00:04:28.099> i've

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:28.250 
the marshmallows but i'm sure i've

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:30.490 
the marshmallows but i'm sure i've
played<00:04:28.580> at<00:04:28.729> other<00:04:28.879> places<00:04:29.180> too<00:04:29.360> this<00:04:30.319> is

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:30.500 
played at other places too this is

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:32.409 
played at other places too this is
definitely<00:04:31.069> not<00:04:31.099> my<00:04:31.460> favorite<00:04:31.490> of<00:04:32.090> the<00:04:32.210> group

00:04:32.409 --> 00:04:32.419 
definitely not my favorite of the group

00:04:32.419 --> 00:04:34.570 
definitely not my favorite of the group
but<00:04:33.139> that's<00:04:33.289> probably<00:04:33.590> because<00:04:33.740> I<00:04:34.129> stink<00:04:34.460> at

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:34.580 
but that's probably because I stink at

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:38.260 
but that's probably because I stink at
it<00:04:34.810> the<00:04:35.810> third<00:04:36.080> game<00:04:36.319> is<00:04:36.560> octopus<00:04:37.220> this<00:04:38.060> game

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:38.270 
it the third game is octopus this game

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:40.600 
it the third game is octopus this game
seems<00:04:38.690> really<00:04:39.110> simple<00:04:39.349> but<00:04:40.039> I<00:04:40.099> think<00:04:40.400> it<00:04:40.490> might

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:40.610 
seems really simple but I think it might

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:41.980 
seems really simple but I think it might
actually<00:04:40.879> be<00:04:41.210> the<00:04:41.449> hardest<00:04:41.750> on<00:04:41.930> the

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:41.990 
actually be the hardest on the

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:44.710 
actually be the hardest on the
collection<00:04:42.560> all<00:04:43.460> you<00:04:43.789> do<00:04:43.940> is<00:04:44.090> climb<00:04:44.300> down<00:04:44.539> the

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:44.720 
collection all you do is climb down the

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:46.869 
collection all you do is climb down the
rope<00:04:44.930> run<00:04:45.349> over<00:04:45.650> grab<00:04:46.039> some<00:04:46.310> treasure<00:04:46.580> and

00:04:46.869 --> 00:04:46.879 
rope run over grab some treasure and

00:04:46.879 --> 00:04:49.390 
rope run over grab some treasure and
then<00:04:47.270> bring<00:04:47.509> it<00:04:47.599> back<00:04:47.629> to<00:04:47.960> the<00:04:48.050> boat<00:04:48.229> the<00:04:49.129> only

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:49.400 
then bring it back to the boat the only

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:51.369 
then bring it back to the boat the only
controls<00:04:49.819> are<00:04:50.030> left<00:04:50.300> and<00:04:50.509> right<00:04:50.659> so<00:04:51.050> it's

00:04:51.369 --> 00:04:51.379 
controls are left and right so it's

00:04:51.379 --> 00:04:54.070 
controls are left and right so it's
really<00:04:51.770> easy<00:04:52.009> but<00:04:52.639> dodging<00:04:53.569> the<00:04:53.690> tentacles

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:54.080 
really easy but dodging the tentacles

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:56.740 
really easy but dodging the tentacles
can<00:04:54.229> be<00:04:54.349> really<00:04:54.740> tough<00:04:54.949> especially<00:04:55.819> since<00:04:56.569> if

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:56.750 
can be really tough especially since if

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:58.809 
can be really tough especially since if
you<00:04:56.960> get<00:04:57.169> greedy<00:04:57.530> and<00:04:57.800> try<00:04:58.009> to<00:04:58.069> grab<00:04:58.310> a<00:04:58.340> ton<00:04:58.699> of

00:04:58.809 --> 00:04:58.819 
you get greedy and try to grab a ton of

00:04:58.819 --> 00:05:01.749 
you get greedy and try to grab a ton of
treasure<00:04:59.090> you<00:04:59.659> move<00:04:59.900> slower<00:05:00.259> you<00:05:01.159> can<00:05:01.460> throw

00:05:01.749 --> 00:05:01.759 
treasure you move slower you can throw

00:05:01.759 --> 00:05:03.790 
treasure you move slower you can throw
the<00:05:01.880> money<00:05:02.000> at<00:05:02.150> the<00:05:02.360> tentacles<00:05:02.810> in<00:05:02.930> a<00:05:03.020> jam<00:05:03.349> but

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:03.800 
the money at the tentacles in a jam but

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:05.950 
the money at the tentacles in a jam but
that<00:05:03.949> basically<00:05:04.130> undoes<00:05:04.940> all<00:05:05.150> your<00:05:05.509> progress

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:05.960 
that basically undoes all your progress

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:08.770 
that basically undoes all your progress
so<00:05:06.590> it's<00:05:06.740> sort<00:05:07.009> of<00:05:07.159> a<00:05:07.250> trade-off<00:05:07.550> I<00:05:07.970> think

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:08.780 
so it's sort of a trade-off I think

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:10.570 
so it's sort of a trade-off I think
graphically<00:05:09.349> this<00:05:09.560> is<00:05:09.710> the<00:05:09.800> most<00:05:09.949> interesting

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:10.580 
graphically this is the most interesting

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:12.790 
graphically this is the most interesting
of<00:05:10.639> the<00:05:10.699> bunch<00:05:11.000> but<00:05:11.750> it's<00:05:11.780> probably<00:05:12.289> my<00:05:12.560> least

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:12.800 
of the bunch but it's probably my least

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:14.559 
of the bunch but it's probably my least
favorite<00:05:13.400> since<00:05:13.669> it's<00:05:13.819> kind<00:05:14.120> of<00:05:14.240> repetitive

00:05:14.559 --> 00:05:14.569 
favorite since it's kind of repetitive

00:05:14.569 --> 00:05:16.779 
favorite since it's kind of repetitive
and<00:05:15.020> I<00:05:15.229> never<00:05:15.560> really<00:05:15.889> felt<00:05:16.099> the<00:05:16.190> urge<00:05:16.340> to<00:05:16.610> beat

00:05:16.779 --> 00:05:16.789 
and I never really felt the urge to beat

00:05:16.789 --> 00:05:19.990 
and I never really felt the urge to beat
my<00:05:16.940> high<00:05:17.150> score<00:05:17.380> my<00:05:18.380> personal<00:05:18.830> best<00:05:19.009> was<00:05:19.250> 127

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:20.000 
my high score my personal best was 127

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.149 
my high score my personal best was 127
but<00:05:20.659> I<00:05:20.690> definitely<00:05:21.020> played<00:05:21.560> this<00:05:21.710> one<00:05:21.860> less

00:05:22.149 --> 00:05:22.159 
but I definitely played this one less

00:05:22.159 --> 00:05:24.219 
but I definitely played this one less
than<00:05:22.190> the<00:05:22.430> others<00:05:22.789> on<00:05:23.599> a<00:05:23.659> totally<00:05:23.960> different

on the lower screen yo she moves around

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:48.159 
on the lower screen yo she moves around
side<00:05:46.099> to<00:05:46.130> side<00:05:46.490> while<00:05:46.789> Luigi<00:05:47.389> and<00:05:47.599> Donkey<00:05:47.990> Kong

out onto the bottom screen the problem

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:00.700 
out onto the bottom screen the problem
is<00:05:58.550> is<00:05:58.729> that<00:05:58.759> you<00:05:58.969> can't<00:05:59.300> dump<00:05:59.569> it<00:05:59.750> on<00:05:59.900> Luigi<00:06:00.319> or

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:00.710 
is is that you can't dump it on Luigi or

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:03.820 
is is that you can't dump it on Luigi or
Donkey<00:06:01.279> Kong<00:06:01.460> jr.<00:06:01.490> if<00:06:02.150> you<00:06:02.990> do<00:06:03.169> you<00:06:03.590> lose<00:06:03.800> a

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:03.830 
Donkey Kong jr. if you do you lose a

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:06.309 
Donkey Kong jr. if you do you lose a
life<00:06:04.099> the<00:06:05.060> only<00:06:05.270> way<00:06:05.389> to<00:06:05.449> prevent<00:06:05.690> this<00:06:06.020> is<00:06:06.259> to

00:06:06.309 --> 00:06:06.319 
life the only way to prevent this is to

00:06:06.319 --> 00:06:08.499 
life the only way to prevent this is to
dump<00:06:06.680> it<00:06:06.830> on<00:06:06.919> the<00:06:07.039> side<00:06:07.250> where<00:06:07.430> yo<00:06:07.669> she<00:06:07.729> is<00:06:08.029> so

00:06:08.499 --> 00:06:08.509 
dump it on the side where yo she is so

00:06:08.509 --> 00:06:10.990 
dump it on the side where yo she is so
he'll<00:06:08.719> eat<00:06:08.930> it<00:06:09.080> before<00:06:09.199> it<00:06:09.469> hits<00:06:09.710> them<00:06:09.940> so<00:06:10.940> you

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:11.000 
he'll eat it before it hits them so you

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.330 
he'll eat it before it hits them so you
have<00:06:11.240> a<00:06:11.270> lot<00:06:11.630> to<00:06:11.840> keep<00:06:11.960> track<00:06:12.020> of<00:06:12.319> you<00:06:13.009> have<00:06:13.190> to

have a lot to keep track of you have to
catch<00:06:13.580> the<00:06:13.789> oil<00:06:14.000> but<00:06:14.509> not<00:06:14.719> overfill<00:06:15.349> either

00:06:19.629 --> 00:06:19.639 
side yoshi is on so you don't spill the

side yoshi is on so you don't spill the
hot<00:06:19.909> oil<00:06:19.940> on<00:06:20.300> the<00:06:20.419> people<00:06:20.719> below<00:06:21.020> it's<00:06:22.009> hard

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:22.340 
hot oil on the people below it's hard

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:24.010 
hot oil on the people below it's hard
but<00:06:22.610> it's<00:06:22.669> really<00:06:23.060> fun<00:06:23.419> once<00:06:23.630> you<00:06:23.719> get<00:06:23.900> the

00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:24.020 
but it's really fun once you get the

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:26.080 
but it's really fun once you get the
hang<00:06:24.050> of<00:06:24.259> it<00:06:24.380> there<00:06:25.190> are<00:06:25.310> two<00:06:25.580> ways<00:06:25.610> you<00:06:25.849> can

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:26.090 
hang of it there are two ways you can

00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:28.330 
hang of it there are two ways you can
die<00:06:26.389> in<00:06:26.419> the<00:06:26.630> game<00:06:26.840> though<00:06:27.050> miss<00:06:27.979> the<00:06:28.159> oil

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:28.340 
die in the game though miss the oil

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:31.209 
die in the game though miss the oil
three<00:06:28.729> times<00:06:29.029> or<00:06:29.659> spill<00:06:30.199> the<00:06:30.349> oil<00:06:30.380> on<00:06:30.800> Donkey

00:06:31.209 --> 00:06:31.219 
three times or spill the oil on Donkey

00:06:31.219 --> 00:06:32.510 
three times or spill the oil on Donkey
Kong<00:06:31.400> jr.<00:06:31.430> and<00:06:31.880> Louie

Kong jr. and Louie

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:35.360 
Kong jr. and Louie
three<00:06:32.610> times<00:06:32.819> each<00:06:33.229> is<00:06:34.229> on<00:06:34.410> its<00:06:34.590> own<00:06:34.860> counter

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:35.370 
three times each is on its own counter

00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:37.760 
three times each is on its own counter
so<00:06:35.669> for<00:06:36.030> example<00:06:36.120> missing<00:06:36.810> the<00:06:36.930> oil<00:06:37.110> once<00:06:37.440> and

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:37.770 
so for example missing the oil once and

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:40.309 
so for example missing the oil once and
spilling<00:06:38.190> the<00:06:38.310> oil<00:06:38.580> on<00:06:38.699> Luigi<00:06:38.970> twice<00:06:39.419> will<00:06:40.110> not

00:06:40.309 --> 00:06:40.319 
spilling the oil on Luigi twice will not

00:06:40.319 --> 00:06:42.770 
spilling the oil on Luigi twice will not
end<00:06:40.560> the<00:06:40.710> game<00:06:40.740> you<00:06:41.580> have<00:06:41.729> to<00:06:41.759> miss<00:06:42.150> three<00:06:42.389> or

00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:42.780 
end the game you have to miss three or

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:45.439 
end the game you have to miss three or
spill<00:06:43.199> three<00:06:43.560> to<00:06:43.740> die<00:06:43.970> this<00:06:44.970> was<00:06:45.180> definitely

00:06:45.439 --> 00:06:45.449 
spill three to die this was definitely

00:06:45.449 --> 00:06:47.809 
spill three to die this was definitely
my<00:06:45.900> favorite<00:06:46.319> of<00:06:46.440> the<00:06:46.530> bunch<00:06:46.560> that's<00:06:47.490> not<00:06:47.699> to

00:06:47.809 --> 00:06:47.819 
my favorite of the bunch that's not to

00:06:47.819 --> 00:06:49.760 
my favorite of the bunch that's not to
say<00:06:47.970> the<00:06:48.120> others<00:06:48.330> were<00:06:48.479> bad<00:06:48.720> but<00:06:49.080> this<00:06:49.349> one<00:06:49.560> was

00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:49.770 
say the others were bad but this one was

00:06:49.770 --> 00:06:52.040 
say the others were bad but this one was
much<00:06:50.069> more<00:06:50.340> fun<00:06:50.639> to<00:06:50.849> try<00:06:51.360> to<00:06:51.419> get<00:06:51.569> a<00:06:51.629> new<00:06:51.840> high

00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:52.050 
much more fun to try to get a new high

00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:57.770 
much more fun to try to get a new high
score<00:06:52.409> my<00:06:53.009> personal<00:06:53.520> best<00:06:53.669> was<00:06:54.169> 387<00:06:56.780> overall

00:06:57.770 --> 00:06:57.780 
score my personal best was 387 overall

00:06:57.780 --> 00:06:59.149 
score my personal best was 387 overall
I'd<00:06:57.990> say<00:06:58.020> the<00:06:58.319> first<00:06:58.590> game<00:06:58.860> &amp;<00:06:59.009> watch<00:06:59.099> gallery

00:06:59.149 --> 00:06:59.159 
I'd say the first game &amp; watch gallery

00:06:59.159 --> 00:07:01.219 
I'd say the first game &amp; watch gallery
is<00:06:59.789> a<00:06:59.849> lot<00:07:00.240> more<00:07:00.449> fun<00:07:00.690> than<00:07:00.840> I<00:07:00.960> thought<00:07:00.990> it

00:07:01.219 --> 00:07:01.229 
is a lot more fun than I thought it

00:07:01.229 --> 00:07:03.950 
is a lot more fun than I thought it
would<00:07:01.349> be<00:07:01.590> sure<00:07:02.520> it's<00:07:02.789> simple<00:07:03.240> but<00:07:03.270> sometimes

00:07:03.950 --> 00:07:03.960 
would be sure it's simple but sometimes

00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:06.770 
would be sure it's simple but sometimes
simple<00:07:04.560> is<00:07:04.650> fun<00:07:04.919> it<00:07:05.159> may<00:07:06.000> not<00:07:06.180> be<00:07:06.240> made<00:07:06.599> by

00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:06.780 
simple is fun it may not be made by

00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:08.839 
simple is fun it may not be made by
Nintendo<00:07:07.259> but<00:07:07.289> honestly<00:07:08.069> you'd<00:07:08.310> never<00:07:08.580> know

00:07:08.839 --> 00:07:08.849 
Nintendo but honestly you'd never know

00:07:08.849 --> 00:07:11.089 
Nintendo but honestly you'd never know
the<00:07:09.000> difference<00:07:09.030> if<00:07:09.479> I<00:07:09.569> didn't<00:07:09.840> tell<00:07:10.020> you<00:07:10.169> it's

00:07:11.089 --> 00:07:11.099 
the difference if I didn't tell you it's

00:07:11.099 --> 00:07:13.219 
the difference if I didn't tell you it's
a<00:07:11.250> polished<00:07:11.699> and<00:07:11.909> fun<00:07:12.120> experience<00:07:12.690> and<00:07:12.960> since

00:07:13.219 --> 00:07:13.229 
a polished and fun experience and since

00:07:13.229 --> 00:07:14.870 
a polished and fun experience and since
it's<00:07:13.409> pretty<00:07:13.740> common<00:07:14.039> you<00:07:14.340> can<00:07:14.520> pick<00:07:14.639> it<00:07:14.789> up

00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:14.880 
it's pretty common you can pick it up

00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:17.120 
it's pretty common you can pick it up
for<00:07:15.060> like<00:07:15.180> three<00:07:15.539> bucks<00:07:15.750> which<00:07:16.259> makes<00:07:16.919> this

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:17.130 
for like three bucks which makes this
