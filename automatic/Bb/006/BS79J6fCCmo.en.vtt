Samsung<00:00:10.410> Galaxy<00:00:10.440> Note<00:00:11.250> 4<00:00:11.420> so<00:00:12.420> the<00:00:12.540> note<00:00:12.660> 4<00:00:12.840> has

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
Samsung Galaxy Note 4 so the note 4 has

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:14.990 
Samsung Galaxy Note 4 so the note 4 has
a<00:00:13.019> similar<00:00:13.259> display<00:00:13.830> size<00:00:14.099> to<00:00:14.429> the<00:00:14.580> note<00:00:14.759> 3

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
a similar display size to the note 3

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.750 
a similar display size to the note 3
it's<00:00:15.179> got<00:00:15.330> a<00:00:15.360> 5.7<00:00:16.230> inch<00:00:16.640> display<00:00:17.640> it's

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
it's got a 5.7 inch display it's

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.330 
it's got a 5.7 inch display it's
actually<00:00:18.119> got<00:00:19.050> a<00:00:19.080> higher<00:00:19.320> resolution<00:00:19.650> as<00:00:20.160> well

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
actually got a higher resolution as well

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.080 
actually got a higher resolution as well
of<00:00:20.550> 2560<00:00:21.510> x<00:00:22.050> 1440<00:00:22.529> so<00:00:23.369> it's<00:00:23.490> really<00:00:23.730> similar<00:00:23.910> to

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
of 2560 x 1440 so it's really similar to

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.099 
of 2560 x 1440 so it's really similar to
the<00:00:24.300> galaxy<00:00:25.109> s5<00:00:25.949> lte-a<00:00:26.670> edition<00:00:27.300> which<00:00:27.869> I

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
the galaxy s5 lte-a edition which I

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.500 
the galaxy s5 lte-a edition which I
didn't<00:00:28.380> get<00:00:28.560> to<00:00:28.619> check<00:00:28.890> out<00:00:29.070> but<00:00:30.060> apparently

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
didn't get to check out but apparently

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.330 
didn't get to check out but apparently
the<00:00:30.630> display<00:00:30.960> and<00:00:31.080> that<00:00:31.170> is<00:00:31.380> really<00:00:31.769> good<00:00:32.009> so

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
the display and that is really good so

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.639 
the display and that is really good so
but<00:00:33.239> yeah<00:00:33.360> the<00:00:33.480> dot<00:00:33.630> 4<00:00:33.870> has<00:00:34.050> a<00:00:34.079> really<00:00:34.410> vivid

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
but yeah the dot 4 has a really vivid

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:37.280 
but yeah the dot 4 has a really vivid
display<00:00:34.980> really<00:00:35.850> bright<00:00:36.090> as<00:00:36.300> well<00:00:36.510> I<00:00:36.750> really

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
display really bright as well I really

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:38.900 
display really bright as well I really
sharp<00:00:37.590> and<00:00:37.890> I<00:00:38.070> guess<00:00:38.250> that's<00:00:38.489> something<00:00:38.610> you

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
sharp and I guess that's something you

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.100 
sharp and I guess that's something you
would<00:00:39.030> expect<00:00:39.450> from<00:00:40.350> an<00:00:40.530> AMOLED<00:00:40.950> display

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:42.110 
would expect from an AMOLED display

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:44.299 
would expect from an AMOLED display
internally<00:00:43.110> you<00:00:43.200> basically<00:00:43.649> get<00:00:43.860> all<00:00:44.100> the

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
internally you basically get all the

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.100 
internally you basically get all the
latest<00:00:44.489> components<00:00:45.270> so<00:00:45.450> it's<00:00:45.750> got<00:00:46.079> a

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
latest components so it's got a

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.490 
latest components so it's got a
Snapdragon<00:00:46.829> 805<00:00:47.210> processor<00:00:48.210> three<00:00:49.110> gigs<00:00:49.320> of

camera with 4k recording now one of the
most<00:01:04.019> talked-about<00:01:04.320> feature<00:01:04.890> of<00:01:05.280> the<00:01:05.460> note<00:01:05.610> 4

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
most talked-about feature of the note 4

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.580 
most talked-about feature of the note 4
is<00:01:06.119> the<00:01:06.270> metal<00:01:06.540> frame<00:01:06.780> around<00:01:07.080> the<00:01:07.260> device

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
is the metal frame around the device

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.560 
is the metal frame around the device
it's<00:01:08.010> kind<00:01:08.369> of<00:01:08.520> similar<00:01:08.700> to<00:01:08.850> the<00:01:09.030> Galaxy<00:01:09.450> alpha

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
it's kind of similar to the Galaxy alpha

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.050 
it's kind of similar to the Galaxy alpha
which<00:01:09.960> was<00:01:10.619> announced<00:01:11.100> not<00:01:11.250> too<00:01:11.430> long<00:01:11.580> ago<00:01:11.640> if

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
which was announced not too long ago if

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.270 
which was announced not too long ago if
I<00:01:12.210> can<00:01:12.360> remember<00:01:12.479> and<00:01:13.020> it<00:01:13.650> actually<00:01:13.860> feels

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
I can remember and it actually feels

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.700 
I can remember and it actually feels
very<00:01:14.640> nice<00:01:14.909> it's<00:01:15.420> probably<00:01:15.780> the<00:01:15.900> best<00:01:16.170> feel<00:01:16.500> on

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
very nice it's probably the best feel on

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.410 
very nice it's probably the best feel on
a<00:01:16.740> samsung<00:01:17.009> device<00:01:17.490> yet<00:01:17.700> although<00:01:17.970> if<00:01:18.330> you

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
a samsung device yet although if you

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.690 
a samsung device yet although if you
remember<00:01:18.840> the<00:01:19.080> Galaxy<00:01:19.799> alpha<00:01:19.979> from<00:01:20.400> years<00:01:20.670> ago

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
remember the Galaxy alpha from years ago

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.719 
remember the Galaxy alpha from years ago
that<00:01:21.090> had<00:01:21.299> a<00:01:21.479> solid<00:01:22.049> built<00:01:22.470> as<00:01:22.650> well<00:01:23.040> but

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
that had a solid built as well but

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.429 
that had a solid built as well but
anyway<00:01:24.000> the<00:01:24.119> back<00:01:24.270> remains<00:01:24.630> the<00:01:24.840> same<00:01:25.080> it's<00:01:25.380> a

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
anyway the back remains the same it's a

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.170 
anyway the back remains the same it's a
faux<00:01:25.619> leather<00:01:25.860> which<00:01:26.250> is<00:01:26.490> actually<00:01:26.700> slightly

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
faux leather which is actually slightly

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.270 
faux leather which is actually slightly
thicker<00:01:27.630> so<00:01:28.049> it<00:01:28.380> didn't<00:01:28.799> feel<00:01:28.920> like<00:01:29.130> an

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
thicker so it didn't feel like an

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.910 
thicker so it didn't feel like an
imitation<00:01:29.670> and<00:01:30.030> in<00:01:30.720> terms<00:01:30.990> of<00:01:31.110> weight<00:01:31.619> I

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
imitation and in terms of weight I

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.819 
imitation and in terms of weight I
haven't<00:01:32.400> really<00:01:32.520> looked<00:01:32.790> into<00:01:32.970> it<00:01:33.270> yet<00:01:33.299> but<00:01:33.829> it

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
haven't really looked into it yet but it

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:37.640 
haven't really looked into it yet but it
felt<00:01:35.280> slightly<00:01:35.909> heavier<00:01:36.329> than<00:01:36.720> the<00:01:37.049> Galaxy

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
felt slightly heavier than the Galaxy

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.520 
felt slightly heavier than the Galaxy
