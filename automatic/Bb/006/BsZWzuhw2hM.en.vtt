that<00:01:02.910> we've<00:01:03.030> got<00:01:03.270> that<00:01:03.890> so<00:01:04.890> many<00:01:05.129> teenage

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
that we've got that so many teenage

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.560 
that we've got that so many teenage
pregnancies<00:01:06.180> one<00:01:06.930> in<00:01:07.080> three<00:01:07.790> girls<00:01:08.790> lose

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
pregnancies one in three girls lose

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.330 
pregnancies one in three girls lose
their<00:01:09.780> virginity<00:01:09.900> for<00:01:10.409> the<00:01:10.530> age<00:01:10.619> of<00:01:10.799> 16<00:01:11.310> and

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
their virginity for the age of 16 and

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:12.679 
their virginity for the age of 16 and
big<00:01:11.729> questions<00:01:11.850> about<00:01:12.299> what<00:01:12.420> can<00:01:12.570> be<00:01:12.600> done

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
big questions about what can be done

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.539 
big questions about what can be done
about<00:01:12.930> that<00:01:13.260> of<00:01:13.650> course<00:01:13.830> what<00:01:13.979> I<00:01:14.010> would<00:01:14.250> say<00:01:14.430> is

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
about that of course what I would say is

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.999 
about that of course what I would say is
if<00:01:14.790> one<00:01:14.970> in<00:01:15.119> three<00:01:15.390> are<00:01:15.630> having<00:01:15.869> sex<00:01:16.259> before<00:01:16.470> 16

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
if one in three are having sex before 16

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.190 
if one in three are having sex before 16
that<00:01:17.130> means<00:01:17.310> two<00:01:17.490> in<00:01:17.640> three<00:01:17.820> are<00:01:18.000> not<00:01:18.330> perhaps

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
that means two in three are not perhaps

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.350 
that means two in three are not perhaps
we<00:01:19.409> should<00:01:19.619> also<00:01:19.799> be<00:01:20.130> thinking<00:01:20.340> what<00:01:21.090> is<00:01:21.210> it

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
we should also be thinking what is it

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.630 
we should also be thinking what is it
about<00:01:21.450> their<00:01:21.930> beliefs<00:01:22.380> and<00:01:22.590> values<00:01:23.040> that

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
about their beliefs and values that

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.810 
about their beliefs and values that
means<00:01:23.820> they<00:01:24.270> choose<00:01:24.509> not<00:01:24.540> to<00:01:24.810> have<00:01:25.049> sex<00:01:25.790> why<00:01:26.790> I

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
means they choose not to have sex why I

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.520 
means they choose not to have sex why I
disagree<00:01:27.240> with<00:01:27.390> that<00:01:27.420> I<00:01:27.540> think<00:01:27.659> that<00:01:27.990> we

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
disagree with that I think that we

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.490 
disagree with that I think that we
should<00:01:28.710> be<00:01:28.860> talking<00:01:29.009> to<00:01:29.369> all<00:01:29.759> the<00:01:29.970> kids<00:01:30.500> you

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
should be talking to all the kids you

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:32.899 
should be talking to all the kids you
know<00:01:31.530> at<00:01:32.009> this<00:01:32.130> age<00:01:32.310> obviously<00:01:32.700> has<00:01:32.790> been<00:01:32.820> a

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
know at this age obviously has been a

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:34.700 
know at this age obviously has been a
lot<00:01:33.060> of<00:01:33.090> research<00:01:33.360> done<00:01:33.390> to<00:01:33.780> say<00:01:33.960> whether<00:01:34.530> it's

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
lot of research done to say whether it's

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:35.990 
lot of research done to say whether it's
a<00:01:34.770> good<00:01:34.890> age<00:01:34.979> to<00:01:35.009> speak<00:01:35.369> to<00:01:35.460> the<00:01:35.549> children<00:01:35.909> are

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
a good age to speak to the children are

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.690 
a good age to speak to the children are
and<00:01:36.270> I<00:01:36.479> think<00:01:36.689> that<00:01:36.780> we<00:01:36.930> can<00:01:37.049> prevent<00:01:37.259> any

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:37.700 
and I think that we can prevent any

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:40.190 
and I think that we can prevent any
pregnancies<00:01:38.700> of<00:01:38.880> teenagers<00:01:39.570> under<00:01:39.689> 16<00:01:40.110> I

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
pregnancies of teenagers under 16 I

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.660 
pregnancies of teenagers under 16 I
think<00:01:40.409> it's<00:01:40.530> a<00:01:40.619> great<00:01:40.829> thing<00:01:40.860> you<00:01:41.549> know<00:01:41.640> I

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
think it's a great thing you know I

00:05:00.689 --> 00:05:00.699 
many people wearing ties and they just

00:05:00.699 --> 00:05:02.010 
many people wearing ties and they just
don't<00:05:00.940> match<00:05:01.180> what<00:05:01.389> the<00:05:01.509> wearing<00:05:01.840> there's

just<00:05:02.169> these<00:05:02.470> are<00:05:02.680> not<00:05:02.860> so<00:05:03.069> ridiculous<00:05:03.460> so<00:05:03.729> I

00:05:03.749 --> 00:05:03.759 
just these are not so ridiculous so I

00:05:03.759 --> 00:05:05.610 
just these are not so ridiculous so I
think<00:05:03.880> ties<00:05:04.270> are<00:05:04.449> out<00:05:04.599> definitely<00:05:04.840> not<00:05:05.169> a<00:05:05.199> size

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:05.620 
think ties are out definitely not a size

think ties are out definitely not a size
