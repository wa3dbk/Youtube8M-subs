00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:23.720
 or the girls 

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:26.180
 I am going to prepare a cheesecake 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:28.699
 among the innumerable varieties that 

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:29.859
 there is in the market in the market that 

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:33.350
 we do among all 

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:35.930
 I would have presented in my version what 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:38.180
 first thing I'm going to do is 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:41.090
 this gelatin 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:45.200
 put it in water soak for about 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:48.550
 minutes and to shorten the process I'll 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:48.550
 to put a minute to the micro 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:52.550
 efe 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:01:01.090
 I have started putting in a container 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:04.440
 philadelphia cheese gives rise to today 

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:06.750
 that I was wrong for a little while 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:10.810
 for what it is 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:13.220
 this if philadelphia like and now I'm going to 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:16.120
 put a yogurt 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:16.120
 from line view 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:28.659
 a mixed everything well and I will add 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:28.659
 the liquid cream 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:41.050
 I'm going to change the rods 

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:49.580
 to be able to do with all this a cream 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.580
 homogeneous 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:57.320
 I have not put any kind of 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:59.970
 Sweetener because you already have enough 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:02.700
 with the saccharin that should carry 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:04.070
 the vital and nothing but also because we 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:07.830
 it would kill the taste of cheese 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:10.100
 this is already here and I'm going to add the 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:10.100
 jelly 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:17.849
 because this could already be shaped and 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:20.939
 stay here perfectly but I'll go 

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:22.769
 to give a color note for children 

00:02:20.939 --> 00:02:26.280
 that is more pleasant and we are going to 

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:30.050
 call it cheesecake 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:34.030
 Smurf could not be the way 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:34.030
 with one aspect per day 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:40.860
 the mollado to the refrigerator two hours and 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:40.860
 ready
