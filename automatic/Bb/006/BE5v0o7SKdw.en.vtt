00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:04.410 
in this video we're going to first talk

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:07.460 
in this video we're going to first talk
about<00:00:04.890> a<00:00:04.920> life<00:00:05.220> cycle<00:00:05.580> of<00:00:05.850> plant<00:00:06.210> with<00:00:07.049> the<00:00:07.230> aid

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:07.470 
about a life cycle of plant with the aid

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:12.200 
about a life cycle of plant with the aid
of<00:00:07.500> a<00:00:08.040> little<00:00:08.309> search<00:00:08.639> from<00:00:09.269> google<00:00:10.170> as<00:00:10.910> we<00:00:11.910> see

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210 
of a little search from google as we see

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.079 
of a little search from google as we see
in<00:00:12.540> the<00:00:12.719> life<00:00:12.900> cycle<00:00:13.230> of<00:00:13.500> the<00:00:13.559> plant<00:00:13.950> first<00:00:14.700> we

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
in the life cycle of the plant first we

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:20.300 
in the life cycle of the plant first we
have<00:00:15.360> the<00:00:15.780> seed<00:00:17.420> after<00:00:18.420> that<00:00:19.140> we<00:00:20.100> have<00:00:20.279> the

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
have the seed after that we have the

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.929 
have the seed after that we have the
seed<00:00:20.850> when<00:00:21.840> it's<00:00:22.020> put<00:00:22.260> in<00:00:22.350> the<00:00:22.500> ground<00:00:22.650> and<00:00:23.160> it

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
seed when it's put in the ground and it

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:27.080 
seed when it's put in the ground and it
starts<00:00:24.480> putting<00:00:24.990> our<00:00:25.260> roots<00:00:25.789> that's<00:00:26.789> a

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
starts putting our roots that's a

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.080 
starts putting our roots that's a
seedling<00:00:27.689> that<00:00:28.019> eventually<00:00:28.680> grows<00:00:29.090> some

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
seedling that eventually grows some

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.750 
seedling that eventually grows some
small<00:00:30.689> leaves<00:00:31.399> after<00:00:32.399> it<00:00:33.239> continues<00:00:34.050> to<00:00:34.290> grow

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:34.760 
small leaves after it continues to grow

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:38.600 
small leaves after it continues to grow
the<00:00:35.760> stems<00:00:36.180> grow<00:00:36.600> more<00:00:37.079> leaves<00:00:37.410> go<00:00:37.829> and

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
the stems grow more leaves go and

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.080 
the stems grow more leaves go and
eventually<00:00:39.329> it<00:00:39.540> starts<00:00:39.930> flowering<00:00:41.090> when

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
eventually it starts flowering when

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:47.510 
eventually it starts flowering when
these<00:00:42.329> flowers<00:00:42.870> in<00:00:43.050> turn<00:00:43.700> become<00:00:45.230> fruits<00:00:46.520> this

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
these flowers in turn become fruits this

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.180 
these flowers in turn become fruits this
is<00:00:47.730> the<00:00:47.879> life<00:00:48.090> cycle<00:00:48.690> of<00:00:48.899> a<00:00:49.469> green<00:00:49.829> bean<00:00:50.579> plant

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:52.190 
is the life cycle of a green bean plant

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:57.139 
is the life cycle of a green bean plant
now<00:00:53.190> what<00:00:54.180> happens<00:00:54.750> with<00:00:55.289> the<00:00:55.440> flowers<00:00:56.149> that's

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
now what happens with the flowers that's

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:00.020 
now what happens with the flowers that's
a<00:00:57.329> good<00:00:57.480> question<00:00:58.219> here<00:00:59.219> we<00:00:59.340> have<00:00:59.520> the<00:00:59.699> flower

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
a good question here we have the flower

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:06.020 
a good question here we have the flower
of<00:01:00.420> a<00:01:00.690> plant<00:01:02.840> in<00:01:03.840> the<00:01:03.899> flower<00:01:04.379> of<00:01:04.650> a<00:01:04.769> plant<00:01:05.070> we

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
of a plant in the flower of a plant we

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.330 
of a plant in the flower of a plant we
can<00:01:06.299> see<00:01:06.600> that<00:01:06.990> there<00:01:07.229> are<00:01:07.260> several<00:01:07.830> things

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
can see that there are several things

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.649 
can see that there are several things
that<00:01:08.760> make<00:01:09.450> up<00:01:09.689> the<00:01:10.290> flower<00:01:11.180> first<00:01:12.180> you<00:01:12.390> have

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
that make up the flower first you have

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:17.960 
that make up the flower first you have
the<00:01:14.540> sepal<00:01:15.540> the<00:01:16.530> sepal<00:01:16.950> is<00:01:17.100> the<00:01:17.280> green<00:01:17.549> part

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
the sepal the sepal is the green part

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.520 
the sepal the sepal is the green part
around<00:01:18.360> the<00:01:18.540> butt<00:01:18.750> of<00:01:18.780> a<00:01:19.020> flower<00:01:19.320> that

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
around the butt of a flower that

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:25.640 
around the butt of a flower that
protects<00:01:20.430> it<00:01:20.580> and<00:01:23.689> after<00:01:24.689> when<00:01:25.200> the<00:01:25.229> flower

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
protects it and after when the flower

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:30.230 
protects it and after when the flower
blooms<00:01:26.159> you<00:01:27.090> have<00:01:27.390> the<00:01:28.170> pedal<00:01:28.590> the<00:01:29.520> pedal<00:01:29.970> is

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
blooms you have the pedal the pedal is

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.740 
blooms you have the pedal the pedal is
usually<00:01:31.079> made<00:01:31.290> of<00:01:31.729> colors<00:01:32.729> that<00:01:32.759> will<00:01:33.240> attract

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
usually made of colors that will attract

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.859 
usually made of colors that will attract
insects<00:01:34.409> so<00:01:35.130> that<00:01:35.369> they<00:01:35.579> will<00:01:35.820> in<00:01:36.090> turn<00:01:36.390> come

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
insects so that they will in turn come

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.140 
insects so that they will in turn come
to<00:01:37.200> the<00:01:37.320> flower<00:01:37.619> and<00:01:37.950> help<00:01:38.820> in<00:01:39.090> the

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
to the flower and help in the

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:43.160 
to the flower and help in the
fertilization<00:01:39.840> process<00:01:40.560> as<00:01:41.750> you<00:01:42.750> can<00:01:42.930> see

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
fertilization process as you can see

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:44.929 
fertilization process as you can see
there<00:01:43.380> are<00:01:43.470> other<00:01:43.590> parts<00:01:44.070> to<00:01:44.189> the<00:01:44.310> plants<00:01:44.759> that

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
there are other parts to the plants that

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:52.010 
there are other parts to the plants that
are<00:01:44.970> important<00:01:46.369> you<00:01:47.369> have<00:01:49.280> the<00:01:50.280> pistol<00:01:51.020> which

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
are important you have the pistol which

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.120 
are important you have the pistol which
is<00:01:52.200> made<00:01:52.409> up<00:01:52.619> of<00:01:52.799> the<00:01:53.130> ovary<00:01:54.350> the<00:01:55.350> style<00:01:55.799> and

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
is made up of the ovary the style and

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:02.780 
is made up of the ovary the style and
the<00:01:56.869> stigma<00:01:58.100> this<00:01:59.100> is<00:01:59.460> where<00:02:00.560> the<00:02:01.560> oval<00:02:02.399> the

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
the stigma this is where the oval the

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:09.350 
the stigma this is where the oval the
ovals<00:02:05.360> reside<00:02:06.360> and<00:02:07.399> when<00:02:08.399> through

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
ovals reside and when through

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:10.380 
ovals reside and when through
fertilization

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:10.390 
fertilization

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:15.809 
fertilization
and<00:02:10.479> either<00:02:10.690> the<00:02:10.929> win<00:02:11.230> or<00:02:11.740> animals<00:02:13.980> blow<00:02:14.980> the

00:02:15.809 --> 00:02:15.819 
and either the win or animals blow the

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:21.510 
and either the win or animals blow the
pollen<00:02:18.870> you<00:02:19.870> can<00:02:20.050> see<00:02:20.260> here<00:02:20.620> the<00:02:20.830> filaments

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:21.520 
pollen you can see here the filaments

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:24.090 
pollen you can see here the filaments
the<00:02:22.120> answer<00:02:22.660> that<00:02:22.990> are<00:02:23.080> part<00:02:23.350> of<00:02:23.440> the<00:02:23.590> stamen

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:24.100 
the answer that are part of the stamen

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:27.930 
the answer that are part of the stamen
blows<00:02:24.850> the<00:02:25.150> pollen<00:02:25.660> into<00:02:25.959> the<00:02:26.470> tube<00:02:26.940> the

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:27.940 
blows the pollen into the tube the

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:31.860 
blows the pollen into the tube the
polling<00:02:28.540> which<00:02:28.870> contains<00:02:29.740> the<00:02:30.420> other<00:02:31.420> part

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:31.870 
polling which contains the other part

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:35.040 
polling which contains the other part
that<00:02:32.170> needs<00:02:32.350> to<00:02:32.709> fertilize<00:02:33.190> the<00:02:33.430> ovum<00:02:34.050> will

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:35.050 
that needs to fertilize the ovum will

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:38.130 
that needs to fertilize the ovum will
come<00:02:35.290> together<00:02:35.590> and<00:02:36.160> then<00:02:37.030> they<00:02:37.300> will<00:02:37.600> create

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:38.140 
come together and then they will create

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:43.979 
come together and then they will create
a<00:02:39.569> fruit<00:02:40.569> and<00:02:41.250> then<00:02:42.250> this<00:02:42.459> fruit<00:02:42.880> in<00:02:43.150> turn<00:02:43.450> will

00:02:43.979 --> 00:02:43.989 
a fruit and then this fruit in turn will

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:48.300 
a fruit and then this fruit in turn will
have<00:02:44.290> seeds<00:02:44.800> and<00:02:45.280> the<00:02:45.540> life<00:02:46.540> cycle<00:02:47.200> of<00:02:47.310> the

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:48.310 
have seeds and the life cycle of the

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:50.729 
have seeds and the life cycle of the
plant<00:02:48.580> will<00:02:48.790> start<00:02:49.209> again<00:02:49.540> with<00:02:49.810> a<00:02:49.989> new<00:02:50.110> seed

00:02:50.729 --> 00:02:50.739 
plant will start again with a new seed

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:58.340 
plant will start again with a new seed
and<00:02:51.100> a<00:02:51.760> new<00:02:51.970> plant

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:58.350 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:03.120 

and<00:02:59.350> this<00:03:00.220> is<00:03:00.400> what<00:03:01.050> makes<00:03:02.050> up<00:03:02.380> the<00:03:02.560> parts<00:03:02.890> of<00:03:03.010> a

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:03.130 
and this is what makes up the parts of a

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:06.060 
and this is what makes up the parts of a
plant<00:03:03.430> you<00:03:03.790> have<00:03:04.540> the<00:03:04.720> root<00:03:05.020> that's<00:03:05.680> under<00:03:06.040> the

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:06.070 
plant you have the root that's under the

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:11.340 
plant you have the root that's under the
