00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:06.210
 hello my name is bouquet shows 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:07.620
 I am technical advisor at the 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:09.420
 French federation of the mountain and 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.190
 of escalate and today I'm going 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.960
 explain to you what the 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.299
 Voluntary errors Voluntary error 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.730
 is a technique that is used in a 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.619
 non-visibility case 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.350
 ie if there is fog if 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:24.570
 feignies to fall pile pile on a 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.920
 refuge that is often very small when 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.590
 we take when we have a big direction 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:31.430
 to take a concrete example you get up 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.200
 in the morning in a shelter 

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:35.210
 the day is not yet up there 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:37.400
 no light and you are looking for the door 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:39.230
 to get out of the room how do you 

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:41.330
 do you get up and you go 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:43.130
 to the wall and once you have found 

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:45.440
 the wall you use the handrail 

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:48.200
 so wall by laying hands flat 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:49.700
 until you find the door is there 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:51.680
 the voluntary error is the same thing 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:54.350
 we will take a step angle 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:57.050
 we're going to hit a mountain in 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:59.180
 a cliff and after we will follow the 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:00.949
 cliff where the mountain on the right 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:04.160
 to arrive on the refuge 

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:05.690
 voluntary error can find 

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:08.060
 easily refuge because if ever 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:09.560
 I was aiming directly at the refuge 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:12.170
 refuge on a great distance it is 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:14.210
 very small so if I do a sighting on 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:16.340
 a refuge at a great distance 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:18.710
 so I'm very lucky 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:21.890
 of my chance to miss out on 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:25.940
 right or left so the guy wants 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:28.550
 to reach the refuge which is here in fact 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:29.600
 if he ever takes a walking angle in 

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:33.350
 direction of the refuge 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:35.600
 he's very lucky to miss out 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:38.390
 and news refuge the mistake 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:42.830
 voluntary is to go against the 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:47.150
 mountain here is to follow the hand 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:48.560
 current to reach the shelter he 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:51.380
 do not forget that to make a 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:53.869
 voluntary error you have to know already to 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:55.610
 pretty much where we are so we pick up a 

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:58.040
 walking angle on the map 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:00.200
 so to go towards the refuge 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:02.630
 and for that we will make a mistake 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:05.869
 voluntary a few degrees to go 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:06.740
 bang on the mountain and then follow to 

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:09.739
 the contour 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:11.510
 the mountain along the shore at 

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:13.280
 refuge so concretely the hiker 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:15.530
 will take a walking angle in 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:17.030
 direction of the house he will raise it 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:19.250
 on the map because he sees nothing and 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:20.450
 in the fog and he's going to make a 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:23.870
 voluntary error 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:26.829
 here then there full north to go to type 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:26.829
 in the mountain 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:35.440
 so there the man chose to go full 

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:37.340
 north but he could have chosen to go to 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:39.200
 different degrees 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:41.750
 it's not important at all 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:43.510
 to hit the mountain and after 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:45.920
 once he's here he's going to move 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:48.200
 to arrive at home 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:50.810
 and now you know how to realize 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:53.630
 a mistaken mistake in the fog 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:55.940
 to reach a shelter but be careful 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:59.349
 these techniques still deserve to have 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:59.349
 a little bit of experience
