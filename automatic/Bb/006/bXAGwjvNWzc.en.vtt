00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:08.000
 hello welcome, I will show you how 

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:10.990
 use the tool follow me to 

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.550
 draw in this case a handrail 

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:15.620
 although we can use the same 

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:17.869
 tool and exactly the same 

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:19.380
 method that we are going to use in this 

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:23.339
 tutorial 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:26.579
 to draw for example a bottle or 

00:00:23.339 --> 00:00:30.090
 to draw a container one 

00:00:26.579 --> 00:00:31.559
 balustrade for example or any type 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.860
 so that we can think of either 

00:00:31.559 --> 00:00:38.160
 cylindrical or polyhedral 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:40.950
 for this I'm going to draw a profile that 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:43.860
 allows the realization of several several 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.220
 forms within the same element in this 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:49.440
 case 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:49.440
 the railing 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:57.030
 once we have drawn 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:59.789
 our railing 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:02.010
 we erase everything we have left to 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:03.850
 to stay with what would simply be 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.610
 the profile 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:08.500
 and we're going to copy it, I'm going to copy it 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:11.610
 this case 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:11.610
 three times 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:18.730
 to teach you several various methods and 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:20.770
 several various forms of work 

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:23.030
 The first thing we are going to do is draw 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:25.860
 an axis 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:27.870
 about which he will turn 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.540
 this face or this profile that we have 

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:32.360
 drawn 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:33.980
 and for the first case we are going to make a 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:36.800
 completely round handrail 

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:38.870
 drawing a circumference of the radius 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:42.740
 that we want 

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:44.900
 we select them and select the 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:46.520
 Follow me with the circle tool 

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:48.260
 selected already we simply have to 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:49.920
 click with this tool on the 

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:53.710
 face 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:56.320
 and is excluded 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:59.060
 totally that face until forming the 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:01.390
 cylinder that we wanted to draw in this 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:01.390
 case 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:08.259
 for the second case or the second type 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:11.000
 of balustrade let's do what 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:14.210
 center 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:17.470
 be for example cylindrical and that 

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:19.740
 extremes be for example 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:22.050
 hexagonal 

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:24.590
 we go with the center we copy this same 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:27.510
 circle us we select it 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:30.690
 we select the tool follow me and 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:32.690
 we click on the profile that we want 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:37.780
 destroy 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:37.780
 now let's make a hexagon 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:43.270
 because we want 

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:44.950
 we select them 

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:47.350
 we select the tool follow me 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:50.880
 because we want that in this case the 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:50.880
 ends have six faces 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:03:00.829
 and here we have here we would have a 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:03:00.829
 cylindrical handrail with ends 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:07.590
 with six with six charges 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:09.760
 for the third case we are going to complicate it 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:12.720
 a little more 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:15.670
 so you can see that we could work 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:18.310
 within the same element with all the 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:20.110
 shapes we want to do for 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:24.030
 example 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:24.030
 that the center is cylindrical 

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:31.840
 we delete and we are going to do 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:34.550
 for example 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:37.210
 a square 

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:40.370
 we had 6 sides we are going to select 

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:44.670
 to make a square 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:46.920
 we'll make the ends square 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:49.440
 selected the square selected the 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:52.370
 follow me and click on the 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:52.370
 face that I want obstructs 

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:58.740
 and the hexagon we had drawn 

00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:01.200
 for the previous case we are worth the 

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:03.480
 we select select the 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:05.980
 follow me and click on the 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:08.350
 face that we want to destroy 

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:11.760
 and we do the same 

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:11.760
 with the rest of faces 

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:15.520
 with this one and with this one 

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:18.830
 already simply 

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:26.400
 What we have left is to erase what we do not 

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:26.400
 we will use 

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:29.920
 A) Yes 

00:04:31.129 --> 00:04:37.789
 and remember you to finish that we can 

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:40.069
 create a component as practically 

00:04:37.789 --> 00:04:43.289
 with any element that we create in 

00:04:40.069 --> 00:04:46.460
 skater and we can modify 

00:04:43.289 --> 00:04:46.460
 its form its 

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:51.129
 its scale 

00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:52.839
 His height 

00:04:51.129 --> 00:04:54.699
 we can modify practically 

00:04:52.839 --> 00:04:57.440
 any property I hope you have 

00:04:54.699 --> 00:05:00.710
 liked and that will help you 

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:03.100
 see you in the next tutorials a 

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:03.100
 greeting
