style the last one is going to be off to

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:54.729 
style the last one is going to be off to
the<00:03:52.910> side<00:03:53.180> but<00:03:53.570> I'm<00:03:53.810> going<00:03:54.050> to<00:03:54.170> also<00:03:54.380> create

00:03:54.729 --> 00:03:54.739 
the side but I'm going to also create

00:03:54.739 --> 00:03:59.199 
the side but I'm going to also create
the<00:03:55.610> illusion<00:03:55.880> of<00:03:56.209> bangs<00:03:57.580> so<00:03:58.580> I<00:03:58.610> sectioned<00:03:59.120> off

00:03:59.199 --> 00:03:59.209 
the illusion of bangs so I sectioned off

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:01.540 
the illusion of bangs so I sectioned off
the<00:03:59.390> bangs<00:03:59.600> combed<00:04:00.290> my<00:04:00.350> hair<00:04:00.470> to<00:04:00.739> the<00:04:00.769> side<00:04:01.070> put

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:01.550 
the bangs combed my hair to the side put

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:05.050 
the bangs combed my hair to the side put
on<00:04:01.670> the<00:04:01.820> donut<00:04:02.239> like<00:04:03.200> so<00:04:03.500> and<00:04:03.830> then<00:04:04.760> I<00:04:04.850> moved

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:05.060 
on the donut like so and then I moved

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:07.180 
on the donut like so and then I moved
all<00:04:05.269> of<00:04:05.330> the<00:04:05.900> hair<00:04:06.140> toward<00:04:06.530> the<00:04:06.680> bottom<00:04:06.860> and

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:07.190 
all of the hair toward the bottom and

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:10.930 
all of the hair toward the bottom and
braided<00:04:07.730> it<00:04:07.910> into<00:04:08.360> a<00:04:08.390> loose<00:04:08.870> braid<00:04:09.700> you<00:04:10.700> just

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:10.940 
braided it into a loose braid you just

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:12.670 
braided it into a loose braid you just
kind<00:04:11.150> of<00:04:11.239> pulled<00:04:11.510> it<00:04:11.660> open<00:04:11.780> a<00:04:12.050> little<00:04:12.080> bit<00:04:12.320> more

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:12.680 
kind of pulled it open a little bit more

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:15.370 
kind of pulled it open a little bit more
so<00:04:13.100> that<00:04:13.130> it's<00:04:13.310> not<00:04:13.459> so<00:04:13.730> perfect<00:04:14.290> then<00:04:15.290> I

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:15.380 
so that it's not so perfect then I

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:18.509 
so that it's not so perfect then I
wrapped<00:04:15.680> it<00:04:15.890> behind<00:04:16.370> the<00:04:16.609> bun<00:04:16.820> and<00:04:17.150> around<00:04:17.540> and

00:04:18.509 --> 00:04:18.519 
wrapped it behind the bun and around and

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:21.400 
wrapped it behind the bun and around and
I'm<00:04:19.519> just<00:04:19.700> pinning<00:04:20.000> all<00:04:20.269> the<00:04:20.450> flyaways<00:04:20.989> down

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:29.440 
area I sprayed it with hairspray

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:32.400 
area I sprayed it with hairspray
smoothed<00:04:30.440> it<00:04:30.680> out<00:04:30.800> with<00:04:31.040> a<00:04:31.070> brush<00:04:31.400> and<00:04:31.790> then

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:32.410 
smoothed it out with a brush and then

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:35.320 
smoothed it out with a brush and then
tucked<00:04:33.410> it<00:04:33.590> wherever<00:04:33.800> it<00:04:34.130> fits<00:04:34.310> in<00:04:34.610> my<00:04:34.820> case<00:04:35.120> it

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:35.330 
tucked it wherever it fits in my case it

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:37.360 
tucked it wherever it fits in my case it
fits<00:04:35.570> like<00:04:35.780> right<00:04:36.110> under<00:04:36.680> the<00:04:36.860> bun<00:04:37.039> and<00:04:37.250> then

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:37.370 
fits like right under the bun and then

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:39.640 
fits like right under the bun and then
off<00:04:37.580> to<00:04:37.820> the<00:04:37.940> side<00:04:38.180> so<00:04:38.960> I<00:04:38.990> pinned<00:04:39.289> that<00:04:39.380> in

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:39.650 
off to the side so I pinned that in

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:41.890 
off to the side so I pinned that in
place<00:04:39.889> and<00:04:40.130> when<00:04:40.310> I'm<00:04:40.460> done<00:04:40.490> this<00:04:41.419> is<00:04:41.630> what<00:04:41.810> it

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:41.900 
place and when I'm done this is what it

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:44.680 
place and when I'm done this is what it
looks<00:04:42.080> like<00:04:42.320> i<00:04:42.729> added<00:04:43.729> a<00:04:43.820> flower<00:04:44.090> on<00:04:44.419> either

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:44.690 
looks like i added a flower on either

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:46.330 
looks like i added a flower on either
side<00:04:45.050> so<00:04:45.080> that<00:04:45.380> you<00:04:45.500> guys<00:04:45.650> can<00:04:45.860> see<00:04:45.919> what<00:04:46.220> it

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:46.340 
side so that you guys can see what it

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:48.820 
side so that you guys can see what it
looks<00:04:46.550> like<00:04:46.789> but<00:04:47.690> I<00:04:47.870> think<00:04:48.139> I<00:04:48.229> preferred<00:04:48.590> it<00:04:48.620> on

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:48.830 
looks like but I think I preferred it on

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:51.969 
looks like but I think I preferred it on
this<00:04:49.070> side<00:04:49.310> so<00:04:49.930> hopefully<00:04:50.930> if<00:04:51.229> you<00:04:51.530> have<00:04:51.770> one

00:04:51.969 --> 00:04:51.979
