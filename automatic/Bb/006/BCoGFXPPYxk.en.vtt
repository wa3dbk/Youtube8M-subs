we<00:00:00.240> will<00:00:00.390> now<00:00:00.570> run<00:00:00.840> an<00:00:01.079> example<00:00:01.920> of<00:00:02.129> the<00:00:02.669> phase

00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:02.909 
we will now run an example of the phase

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:06.140 
we will now run an example of the phase

that<00:00:06.390> in<00:00:06.629> lecture<00:00:07.700> 3.3<00:00:08.700> talked<00:00:08.970> about<00:00:11.780> and<00:00:12.780> we

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
that in lecture 3.3 talked about and we

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:15.049 
that in lecture 3.3 talked about and we
run<00:00:13.049> an<00:00:13.170> example<00:00:13.769> of<00:00:13.950> this<00:00:14.219> network<00:00:14.519> this

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
run an example of this network this

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:20.150 
run an example of this network this

network is is available on on this

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:21.800 
network is is available on on this
website<00:00:20.400> and<00:00:20.820> if<00:00:20.910> the<00:00:21.090> network<00:00:21.300> it<00:00:21.600> was

NYU<00:00:24.600> it's<00:00:25.380> one<00:00:25.619> example<00:00:25.949> of<00:00:26.310> the<00:00:26.460> torch

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:26.750 
NYU it's one example of the torch

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:32.200 
NYU it's one example of the torch
demonstration<00:00:29.150> so<00:00:30.150> I<00:00:30.539> am<00:00:30.990> in<00:00:31.109> that<00:00:31.260> directory

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:32.210 
demonstration so I am in that directory

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:35.660 
demonstration so I am in that directory
the<00:00:33.210> main<00:00:33.420> fight<00:00:33.600> to<00:00:33.809> run<00:00:33.960> is<00:00:34.170> the<00:00:34.230> run<00:00:35.040> not<00:00:35.399> Lua

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
the main fight to run is the run not Lua

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.400 
the main fight to run is the run not Lua
file<00:00:36.260> so<00:00:37.260> i<00:00:37.290> will<00:00:37.590> say<00:00:37.800> torch<00:00:38.300> run<00:00:39.300> dot<00:00:39.899> know

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
file so i will say torch run dot know

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:46.700 
file so i will say torch run dot know
what<00:00:42.800> he<00:00:43.800> will<00:00:44.040> grab<00:00:44.430> my<00:00:45.210> camera<00:00:45.510> input<00:00:45.989> and

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
what he will grab my camera input and

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.060 
what he will grab my camera input and
there<00:00:47.160> it<00:00:47.309> is<00:00:47.480> this<00:00:48.480> is<00:00:48.629> basically<00:00:49.289> the<00:00:49.890> phase

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
there it is this is basically the phase

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.069 
there it is this is basically the phase

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
detector running it's a simple quite a

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.850 
detector running it's a simple quite a

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:54.860 
simple interface as you can see it

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
the neural network and the display so

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.980 
the neural network and the display so
that<00:01:10.140> you<00:01:10.470> have<00:01:11.250> a<00:01:11.280> good<00:01:11.520> idea<00:01:11.640> of<00:01:11.909> how<00:01:12.360> long<00:01:12.600> it

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
that you have a good idea of how long it

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.859 
that you have a good idea of how long it
takes<00:01:13.439> more<00:01:13.740> or<00:01:13.890> less<00:01:14.040> so<00:01:14.880> most<00:01:15.420> of<00:01:15.540> the<00:01:15.659> time

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
takes more or less so most of the time

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.749 
takes more or less so most of the time
is<00:01:16.020> basically<00:01:16.530> taken<00:01:16.860> by<00:01:17.009> the<00:01:17.070> neural<00:01:17.430> network

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
is basically taken by the neural network

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:20.840 
is basically taken by the neural network
prediction<00:01:18.330> here<00:01:18.960> you<00:01:19.110> can<00:01:19.320> see<00:01:19.850> naturally

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
prediction here you can see naturally

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.100 
prediction here you can see naturally

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:30.870 

and<00:01:28.479> he<00:01:28.600> also<00:01:28.720> makes<00:01:29.049> mistakes<00:01:29.530> it's<00:01:30.460> not<00:01:30.640> one

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:30.880 
and he also makes mistakes it's not one

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:33.480 
and he also makes mistakes it's not one
perfect<00:01:31.479> network<00:01:31.840> back<00:01:32.049> here<00:01:33.009> you<00:01:33.100> can<00:01:33.280> see

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:33.490 
perfect network back here you can see

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:36.270 
perfect network back here you can see
the<00:01:34.360> network<00:01:34.750> working<00:01:35.079> properly<00:01:35.530> there's<00:01:36.100> the

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:36.280 
the network working properly there's the

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:37.950 
the network working properly there's the
threshold<00:01:36.820> right<00:01:37.000> here<00:01:37.299> even<00:01:37.659> though<00:01:37.810> it<00:01:37.869> is

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:37.960 
threshold right here even though it is

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:40.800 
threshold right here even though it is
not<00:01:38.229> labeled<00:01:38.500> that<00:01:39.430> can<00:01:40.240> clean<00:01:40.509> up<00:01:40.539> the

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:40.810 
not labeled that can clean up the

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:44.070 
not labeled that can clean up the
detections<00:01:41.189> so<00:01:42.189> you<00:01:42.250> can<00:01:42.579> lower<00:01:42.759> it<00:01:42.939> you<00:01:43.899> know

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:44.080 
detections so you can lower it you know

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:47.070 
detections so you can lower it you know
you<00:01:44.350> want<00:01:44.409> to<00:01:44.619> have<00:01:44.830> more<00:01:45.039> and<00:01:45.310> more<00:01:46.080> detection

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:47.080 
you want to have more and more detection

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:49.440 
you want to have more and more detection
so<00:01:48.039> that's<00:01:48.250> not<00:01:48.460> good<00:01:48.700> you<00:01:48.970> can<00:01:49.179> hire<00:01:49.420> the

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:49.450 
so that's not good you can hire the

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:52.410 
so that's not good you can hire the
threshold<00:01:50.229> basically<00:01:50.350> and<00:01:51.039> try<00:01:51.880> to<00:01:51.939> clean<00:01:52.299> up

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:52.420 
threshold basically and try to clean up

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:55.859 
threshold basically and try to clean up
as<00:01:53.140> much<00:01:53.380> attention<00:01:53.560> as<00:01:54.009> possible<00:01:54.750> there<00:01:55.750> is

00:01:55.859 --> 00:01:55.869 
as much attention as possible there is

00:01:55.869 --> 00:01:58.319 
as much attention as possible there is
also<00:01:56.049> be<00:01:56.320> slightly<00:01:56.590> cleaner<00:01:56.950> this<00:01:57.909> is<00:01:58.060> one<00:01:58.210> of

00:01:58.319 --> 00:01:58.329 
also be slightly cleaner this is one of

00:01:58.329 --> 00:02:01.289 
also be slightly cleaner this is one of
the<00:01:58.420> parameter<00:01:58.990> of<00:01:59.020> the<00:01:59.439> system<00:02:00.280> the<00:02:01.000> neural

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:01.299 
the parameter of the system the neural

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:07.850 
the parameter of the system the neural
network<00:02:01.659> is<00:02:01.840> Iran's<00:02:03.810> we<00:02:04.810> will<00:02:05.080> in<00:02:05.979> lecture<00:02:06.390> 4.2

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
network is Iran's we will in lecture 4.2

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.880 
network is Iran's we will in lecture 4.2
the<00:02:08.860> next<00:02:09.130> lecture<00:02:09.310> we<00:02:09.910> will<00:02:09.940> basically

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
the next lecture we will basically

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:14.100 
the next lecture we will basically
analyze<00:02:11.890> the<00:02:12.580> code<00:02:12.849> of<00:02:13.090> this<00:02:13.390> neural<00:02:13.690> network

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.110 
analyze the code of this neural network

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:16.710 
analyze the code of this neural network
and<00:02:14.470> then<00:02:15.010> we<00:02:15.190> will<00:02:15.400> also<00:02:15.549> see<00:02:16.000> how<00:02:16.360> this<00:02:16.660> is

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 
and then we will also see how this is

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:20.549 
and then we will also see how this is
that<00:02:17.709> this<00:02:17.830> can<00:02:18.069> be<00:02:18.220> trained
