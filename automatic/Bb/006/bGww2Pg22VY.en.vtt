he<00:02:18.520> was<00:02:18.819> involved<00:02:19.060> in<00:02:19.270> an<00:02:19.390> awful<00:02:19.660> lot<00:02:19.810> of<00:02:20.400> the

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
he was involved in an awful lot of the

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.479 
he was involved in an awful lot of the
key<00:02:21.580> moments<00:02:21.610> today<00:02:22.120> potentially<00:02:22.860> I<00:02:23.860> think<00:02:24.340> he

00:02:24.479 --> 00:02:24.489 
key moments today potentially I think he

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:29.120 
key moments today potentially I think he
is<00:02:24.520> a<00:02:25.290> shown<00:02:26.290> great<00:02:26.620> potential<00:02:27.120> he<00:02:28.120> is<00:02:28.300> a<00:02:28.330> bit

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
is a shown great potential he is a bit

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:33.449 
is a shown great potential he is a bit
too<00:02:30.130> much<00:02:30.569> still<00:02:31.569> mentally<00:02:32.280> determined<00:02:33.280> to

00:02:33.449 --> 00:02:33.459 
too much still mentally determined to

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:35.880 
too much still mentally determined to
score<00:02:33.700> it<00:02:33.760> any<00:02:33.970> costs<00:02:34.420> when<00:02:34.900> he<00:02:35.020> comes<00:02:35.260> down<00:02:35.440> I

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:35.890 
score it any costs when he comes down I

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:37.860 
score it any costs when he comes down I
think<00:02:35.950> he's<00:02:36.310> a<00:02:36.340> lot<00:02:36.580> to<00:02:36.760> come<00:02:36.970> from<00:02:37.180> him<00:02:37.330> but

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:37.870
