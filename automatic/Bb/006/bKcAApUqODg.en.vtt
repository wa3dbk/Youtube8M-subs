hi Emily Taylor and this is my happiness

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:19.860 
hi Emily Taylor and this is my happiness
energy<00:00:15.059> and<00:00:16.059> I<00:00:17.040> have<00:00:18.040> set<00:00:18.400> this<00:00:18.550> up<00:00:18.760> so<00:00:19.090> it<00:00:19.390> is<00:00:19.420> a

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:19.870 
energy and I have set this up so it is a

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:22.410 
energy and I have set this up so it is a
little<00:00:20.140> bit<00:00:20.289> of<00:00:20.380> a<00:00:20.440> flying<00:00:20.710> machine<00:00:21.119> it's<00:00:22.119> a

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:22.420 
little bit of a flying machine it's a

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:27.200 
little bit of a flying machine it's a
it's<00:00:23.050> very<00:00:23.290> low<00:00:23.590> on<00:00:24.220> the<00:00:24.280> action<00:00:25.200> and<00:00:26.200> then

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
it's very low on the action and then

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.150 
it's very low on the action and then
traditionally<00:00:28.210> Ibanez<00:00:28.570> are<00:00:29.160> fantastically

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:30.160 
traditionally Ibanez are fantastically

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:33.150 
traditionally Ibanez are fantastically
fast<00:00:30.490> necks<00:00:30.990> quite<00:00:31.990> easy<00:00:32.230> and<00:00:32.469> comfortable<00:00:32.829> to

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:33.160 
fast necks quite easy and comfortable to

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:39.060 
fast necks quite easy and comfortable to
play<00:00:33.960> problem<00:00:34.960> is<00:00:35.790> that<00:00:37.530> when<00:00:38.530> this<00:00:38.680> guitar

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:39.070 
play problem is that when this guitar

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:42.919 
play problem is that when this guitar
gets<00:00:39.789> cold<00:00:40.230> or<00:00:41.230> goes<00:00:41.649> from<00:00:41.859> cold<00:00:42.100> to<00:00:42.190> being<00:00:42.460> one

00:00:42.919 --> 00:00:42.929 
gets cold or goes from cold to being one

00:00:42.929 --> 00:00:45.779 
gets cold or goes from cold to being one
it<00:00:43.929> tends<00:00:44.289> to<00:00:44.440> divert<00:00:44.739> out<00:00:45.070> of<00:00:45.190> children<00:00:45.550> quite

00:00:45.779 --> 00:00:45.789 
it tends to divert out of children quite

00:00:45.789 --> 00:00:50.160 
it tends to divert out of children quite
easily<00:00:46.469> which<00:00:47.469> is<00:00:47.499> no<00:00:48.329> not<00:00:49.329> a<00:00:49.359> good<00:00:49.570> thing<00:00:49.780> if

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:50.170 
easily which is no not a good thing if

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:53.069 
easily which is no not a good thing if
you're<00:00:50.320> playing<00:00:50.559> life<00:00:50.859> then<00:00:51.730> so<00:00:52.449> we're<00:00:52.960> going

00:00:53.069 --> 00:00:53.079 
you're playing life then so we're going

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:56.939 
you're playing life then so we're going
to<00:00:53.170> correct<00:00:53.409> that<00:00:54.899> and<00:00:55.899> what<00:00:56.530> you<00:00:56.620> should<00:00:56.769> know

00:00:56.939 --> 00:00:56.949 
to correct that and what you should know

00:00:56.949 --> 00:01:00.479 
to correct that and what you should know
is<00:00:57.129> I've<00:00:57.940> never<00:00:58.179> done<00:00:58.420> this<00:00:58.569> before<00:00:58.629> so<00:00:59.489> I'm

00:01:00.479 --> 00:01:00.489 
is I've never done this before so I'm

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:04.200 
is I've never done this before so I'm
making<00:01:00.940> it<00:01:01.059> up<00:01:02.309> so<00:01:03.309> let's<00:01:03.670> see<00:01:03.850> if<00:01:03.909> it<00:01:03.999> works

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:04.210 
making it up so let's see if it works

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:06.780 
making it up so let's see if it works
before<00:01:04.449> your<00:01:04.750> ground<00:01:05.110> and<00:01:05.580> started<00:01:06.580> pairing

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:06.790 
before your ground and started pairing

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:12.330 
before your ground and started pairing
yours<00:01:08.550> so<00:01:09.550> we're<00:01:10.300> gonna<00:01:10.829> we're<00:01:11.829> gonna<00:01:11.950> stop

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:12.340 
yours so we're gonna we're gonna stop

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:16.499 
yours so we're gonna we're gonna stop
the<00:01:13.350> trim<00:01:14.350> from<00:01:15.130> actually<00:01:15.579> been<00:01:15.880> able<00:01:16.060> to<00:01:16.210> pull

00:01:16.499 --> 00:01:16.509 
the trim from actually been able to pull

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:19.260 
the trim from actually been able to pull
back<00:01:16.540> I<00:01:17.280> think<00:01:18.280> I<00:01:18.520> can<00:01:18.700> achieve<00:01:18.820> that<00:01:19.060> by

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:19.270 
back I think I can achieve that by

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:23.639 
back I think I can achieve that by
bending<00:01:19.659> strings<00:01:20.549> and<00:01:22.200> really<00:01:23.200> don't<00:01:23.380> using

00:01:23.639 --> 00:01:23.649 
bending strings and really don't using

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:26.399 
bending strings and really don't using
up<00:01:23.770> too<00:01:24.100> much<00:01:24.250> anyway<00:01:24.670> but<00:01:24.909> this<00:01:25.840> seems<00:01:26.170> to<00:01:26.320> be

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:26.409 
up too much anyway but this seems to be

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:29.310 
up too much anyway but this seems to be
the<00:01:26.530> problem<00:01:26.740> that<00:01:26.979> is<00:01:27.610> a<00:01:27.820> flowing<00:01:28.210> trend<00:01:28.659> and

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:29.320 
the problem that is a flowing trend and

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:32.100 
the problem that is a flowing trend and
the<00:01:29.469> only<00:01:29.680> things<00:01:29.920> are<00:01:30.490> holding<00:01:31.000> it<00:01:31.149> by<00:01:31.899> these

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:32.110 
the only things are holding it by these

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:35.660 
the only things are holding it by these
two<00:01:32.409> little<00:01:32.740> screws<00:01:32.950> here<00:01:33.810> which<00:01:34.810> are

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
two little screws here which are

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.580 
two little screws here which are
predominantly<00:01:36.869> holding<00:01:37.869> it<00:01:37.990> to<00:01:38.109> the<00:01:38.229> guitar

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:38.590 
predominantly holding it to the guitar

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:40.770 
predominantly holding it to the guitar
so<00:01:39.460> we're<00:01:39.549> gonna<00:01:39.640> stop<00:01:39.939> that<00:01:40.149> and<00:01:40.539> we're<00:01:40.659> going

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:40.780 
so we're gonna stop that and we're going

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:55.940 
so we're gonna stop that and we're going
to<00:01:40.840> put<00:01:40.990> Block<00:01:41.259> in<00:01:41.500> there

00:03:48.340 --> 00:04:02.009 

with<00:03:49.340> this<00:03:50.889> okay<00:03:51.919> then<00:03:58.750> your<00:03:59.750> Ibanez<00:04:01.000> Floyd

00:04:02.009 --> 00:04:02.019 
with this okay then your Ibanez Floyd

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:04.869 
with this okay then your Ibanez Floyd
whatever<00:04:03.019> it's<00:04:03.230> low<00:04:03.530> pro<00:04:03.949> 2<00:04:04.310> or<00:04:04.489> whatever<00:04:04.760> this

00:04:04.869 --> 00:04:04.879 
whatever it's low pro 2 or whatever this

00:04:04.879 --> 00:04:07.860 
whatever it's low pro 2 or whatever this
fall<00:04:05.439> will<00:04:06.439> just<00:04:06.620> pull<00:04:06.859> away

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:07.870 
fall will just pull away

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:12.069 
fall will just pull away
so<00:04:08.870> I've<00:04:09.319> measured<00:04:10.060> then<00:04:11.060> the<00:04:11.480> tiny<00:04:11.750> gap

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:12.079 
so I've measured then the tiny gap

00:04:12.079 --> 00:04:17.409 
so I've measured then the tiny gap
between<00:04:13.840> between<00:04:14.840> the<00:04:14.930> flowing<00:04:15.290> tram<00:04:15.590> and<00:04:16.419> and

00:04:17.409 --> 00:04:17.419 
between between the flowing tram and and

00:04:17.419 --> 00:04:29.490 
between between the flowing tram and and
the<00:04:17.900> guitar<00:04:18.289> and<00:04:18.789> I've<00:04:19.789> measured<00:04:20.180> it<00:04:20.509> at<00:04:21.520> 5

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:29.500 

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:33.640 

tiny<00:04:30.500> little<00:04:30.740> nauseous<00:04:31.389> now<00:04:32.389> now<00:04:32.960> you<00:04:33.020> need<00:04:33.560> to

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:33.650 
tiny little nauseous now now you need to

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:34.719 
tiny little nauseous now now you need to
be<00:04:33.680> careful<00:04:33.919> that<00:04:34.280> when<00:04:34.370> you<00:04:34.490> pull<00:04:34.639> the

00:04:34.719 --> 00:04:34.729 
be careful that when you pull the

00:04:34.729 --> 00:04:36.909 
be careful that when you pull the
washers<00:04:35.120> onto<00:04:35.300> the<00:04:35.570> plate<00:04:36.110> they're<00:04:36.740> not

00:04:36.909 --> 00:04:36.919 
washers onto the plate they're not

00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:39.730 
washers onto the plate they're not
affecting<00:04:37.460> the<00:04:37.490> the<00:04:38.120> springs<00:04:38.479> all<00:04:38.780> if<00:04:39.199> they're

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:39.740 
affecting the the springs all if they're

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:41.409 
affecting the the springs all if they're
touching<00:04:39.889> the<00:04:40.220> springs<00:04:40.550> then<00:04:40.880> it's<00:04:41.120> not<00:04:41.240> going

00:04:41.409 --> 00:04:41.419 
touching the springs then it's not going

00:04:41.419 --> 00:04:44.529 
touching the springs then it's not going
to<00:04:41.479> work<00:04:41.979> and<00:04:42.979> this<00:04:43.669> is<00:04:43.729> how<00:04:44.000> we<00:04:44.060> build<00:04:44.360> our

00:04:44.529 --> 00:04:44.539 
to work and this is how we build our

00:04:44.539 --> 00:05:06.450 
to work and this is how we build our
washes<00:04:44.930> up

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:06.460 

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:12.450 

so<00:05:07.000> we're<00:05:07.120> gonna<00:05:07.210> make<00:05:07.419> two<00:05:07.750> of<00:05:07.780> these<00:05:10.800> ace<00:05:11.800> if

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:12.460 
so we're gonna make two of these ace if

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:15.689 
so we're gonna make two of these ace if
you<00:05:12.580> don't<00:05:12.729> put<00:05:12.910> the<00:05:13.030> lid<00:05:13.240> back<00:05:13.270> on<00:05:13.660> then<00:05:14.699> bad

00:05:15.689 --> 00:05:15.699 
you don't put the lid back on then bad

00:05:15.699 --> 00:05:34.879 
you don't put the lid back on then bad
things<00:05:15.729> will<00:05:16.300> happen<00:05:27.240> I<00:05:29.400> fixed<00:05:33.060> some<00:05:34.060> washers

00:05:34.879 --> 00:05:34.889 
things will happen I fixed some washers

00:05:34.889 --> 00:05:39.570 
things will happen I fixed some washers
to<00:05:35.889> the<00:05:36.009> back<00:05:37.080> of<00:05:38.080> my<00:05:38.350> Floriana<00:05:38.919> me<00:05:39.100> think

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:39.580 
to the back of my Floriana me think

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:43.469 
to the back of my Floriana me think
now<00:05:40.570> this<00:05:40.870> prevents<00:05:41.680> the<00:05:41.860> whole<00:05:42.370> arm<00:05:42.729> turning

00:05:43.469 --> 00:05:43.479 
now this prevents the whole arm turning

00:05:43.479 --> 00:05:46.529 
now this prevents the whole arm turning
back<00:05:43.800> so<00:05:44.800> you<00:05:44.860> can't<00:05:45.220> pull<00:05:45.610> up<00:05:45.729> on<00:05:45.970> your<00:05:46.030> whammy

00:05:46.529 --> 00:05:46.539 
back so you can't pull up on your whammy

00:05:46.539 --> 00:05:51.290 
back so you can't pull up on your whammy
bar<00:05:46.780> it<00:05:47.260> fixes<00:05:47.740> it<00:05:48.810> and<00:05:49.810> I'm<00:05:49.990> gonna<00:05:50.139> show<00:05:50.440> you

bar it fixes it and I'm gonna show you

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:54.060
