00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:05.060 
sometimes it can be something as simple
as<00:02:01.979> just<00:02:02.450> replacing<00:02:03.450> the<00:02:03.780> thermostat<00:02:04.350> to<00:02:04.590> get

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
as just replacing the thermostat to get

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.399 
as just replacing the thermostat to get
the<00:02:05.219> engine<00:02:05.640> to<00:02:05.820> run<00:02:06.090> at<00:02:06.390> the<00:02:06.960> proper

the engine to run at the proper
operating<00:02:07.890> temperature<00:02:08.690> well<00:02:09.690> I<00:02:10.080> had<00:02:10.770> a

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
operating temperature well I had a

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.100 
operating temperature well I had a

steel<00:02:13.290> of<00:02:13.320> course<00:02:13.530> I've<00:02:13.860> gone<00:02:14.460> to<00:02:14.700> a<00:02:14.730> lot<00:02:15.060> of

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
steel of course I've gone to a lot of

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.210 
steel of course I've gone to a lot of
different<00:02:15.510> things<00:02:15.660> and<00:02:16.020> tuning<00:02:16.440> it<00:02:16.590> and

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
different things and tuning it and

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.070 
different things and tuning it and
rebuilding<00:02:17.880> the<00:02:18.060> injectors<00:02:18.510> and<00:02:18.720> so<00:02:18.840> on

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
rebuilding the injectors and so on

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.230 
rebuilding the injectors and so on
but<00:02:19.200> boy<00:02:19.800> when<00:02:19.950> I<00:02:20.010> get<00:02:20.370> out<00:02:20.490> on<00:02:20.640> the<00:02:20.760> freeway

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:21.240 
but boy when I get out on the freeway

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:24.110 
but boy when I get out on the freeway
and<00:02:21.270> punch<00:02:21.900> that<00:02:22.140> thing<00:02:22.200> really<00:02:22.740> hard<00:02:23.100> I<00:02:23.400> get<00:02:24.090> a

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
and punch that thing really hard I get a

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.980 
and punch that thing really hard I get a
lot<00:02:24.840> of<00:02:24.870> heavy<00:02:25.680> black<00:02:26.640> smoke<00:02:26.910> billowing<00:02:27.750> out

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:27.990 
lot of heavy black smoke billowing out

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:31.040 
lot of heavy black smoke billowing out
of<00:02:28.050> exhaust<00:02:28.500> it<00:02:28.800> only<00:02:29.010> happened<00:02:29.640> under<00:02:30.450> heavy

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.050 
of exhaust it only happened under heavy

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:34.280 
of exhaust it only happened under heavy
heavy<00:02:31.560> acceleration<00:02:32.430> so<00:02:33.150> I<00:02:33.180> became<00:02:33.540> a<00:02:33.990> little

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
heavy acceleration so I became a little

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:35.900 
heavy acceleration so I became a little
suspicious<00:02:34.740> that<00:02:35.010> it<00:02:35.250> was<00:02:35.370> probably<00:02:35.730> looking

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 
suspicious that it was probably looking

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:38.900 
suspicious that it was probably looking
at<00:02:36.210> something<00:02:37.100> you<00:02:38.100> know<00:02:38.220> other<00:02:38.460> than<00:02:38.670> what

that it had to be a fuel and / fuelling
problem<00:02:44.610> there<00:02:44.790> was<00:02:44.880> an<00:02:45.060> extreme<00:02:45.600> rich

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:46.050 
problem there was an extreme rich

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:49.190

mixture<00:02:46.530> of<00:02:46.680> fuel<00:02:46.950> and<00:02:47.280> I<00:02:48.209> decided<00:02:48.660> okay<00:02:49.080> it

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
mixture of fuel and I decided okay it

mixture of fuel and I decided okay it
was<00:02:49.320> time<00:02:49.680> to<00:02:50.190> pull<00:02:50.430> the<00:02:50.459> turbocharger<00:02:51.300> and

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
was time to pull the turbocharger and

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:54.260 
was time to pull the turbocharger and
you<00:02:52.320> can't<00:02:52.680> believe<00:02:52.890> what<00:02:53.070> I<00:02:53.310> found<00:02:53.400> on<00:02:54.060> the

worst I've ever seen and it became very

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:05.600 
worst I've ever seen and it became very
obvious<00:03:02.790> that<00:03:03.570> this<00:03:04.200> turbocharger<00:03:05.190> was<00:03:05.400> not

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:05.610 
obvious that this turbocharger was not

spooling up fast enough remember when

enough<00:03:17.580> to<00:03:17.910> force<00:03:18.810> the<00:03:18.900> air<00:03:19.670> into<00:03:20.670> the<00:03:20.790> engine

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:20.910 
enough to force the air into the engine

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:29.780 
well that wasn't happening on that 300
SDL<00:03:26.489> so<00:03:26.910> I<00:03:27.150> went<00:03:28.140> out<00:03:28.260> and<00:03:28.440> got<00:03:28.530> a<00:03:29.010> brand<00:03:29.580> new

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:29.790 
SDL so I went out and got a brand new

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:48.289 
that thing at 60 miles an hour and there
is<00:03:45.060> literally<00:03:45.510> no<00:03:46.080> smoke<00:03:46.470> now<00:03:46.680> so<00:03:47.250> that's<00:03:48.090> an

diesel<00:04:02.700> engine<00:04:03.000> smoke<00:04:03.330> and<00:04:03.600> performance

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:04.140 
diesel engine smoke and performance

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:06.800 
diesel engine smoke and performance
problems<00:04:04.560> usually<00:04:04.860> loss<00:04:05.400> of<00:04:05.670> power<00:04:05.880> and<00:04:06.090> smoke

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:06.810 
problems usually loss of power and smoke

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:10.130 
problems usually loss of power and smoke
go<00:04:07.110> hand<00:04:07.440> in<00:04:07.620> hand<00:04:07.680> and<00:04:08.250> a<00:04:08.880> lot<00:04:09.180> of<00:04:09.209> the<00:04:09.480> causes

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:10.140 
go hand in hand and a lot of the causes

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:14.870 
go hand in hand and a lot of the causes
that<00:04:10.310> create<00:04:11.360> excess<00:04:12.360> smoke<00:04:12.480> also<00:04:13.019> are<00:04:13.880> going

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:14.880 
that create excess smoke also are going

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:16.729 
that create excess smoke also are going
to<00:04:15.090> give<00:04:15.269> you<00:04:15.420> low<00:04:15.720> power<00:04:16.079> or<00:04:16.440> poor

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:16.739 
to give you low power or poor

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:19.130 
to give you low power or poor
performance<00:04:17.340> from<00:04:17.489> the<00:04:17.609> engine<00:04:17.940> so<00:04:18.540> just<00:04:18.930> stay

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:19.140 
performance from the engine so just stay

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:31.279 
performance from the engine so just stay
tuned<00:04:19.470> for<00:04:19.950> future<00:04:20.220> videos<00:04:20.400> on<00:04:20.970> this<00:04:21.120> subject
