00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:36.640
 Hello dear Billerbeck spectators 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:40.030
 comma fabian come here with a test 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:41.949
 voice is the endpoint where existent 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:44.559
 brand new in the app store and one 

00:00:41.949 --> 00:00:47.860
 alternative to siri point where it 

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:50.260
 assistant is based on only 1.1 of the 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:52.030
 speech recognition technology comma which 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:54.489
 among others with dragon dictation 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:56.559
 is used point you see me here 

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:58.600
 already in the recording mask comma 

00:00:56.559 --> 00:01:01.059
 I dictate the text here 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:02.860
 already point where it is is natural 

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:05.259
 not so profound in the system 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:07.660
 integrated like siri that allows apple 

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:10.330
 not even that means you can 

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:12.640
 do not create appointments or start music 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:14.950
 point where it supports assistant 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:18.160
 numerous voice commands among others 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:19.899
 new line or new paragraph point the 

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:22.780
 Unfortunately, app only allows dictating 

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:25.119
 relatively short messages long e-mails 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:27.550
 are not possible come therefore end 

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:29.800
 I now synonymous times the recording or 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:32.580
 the recording will be finished automatically 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:34.750
 I already reached the limit 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:36.880
 Now the data will be sent to the new one 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:38.799
 server transfers and analyzes here 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:40.960
 is the text synonymous already a few errors 

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:41.619
 are in there but the result is yet 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:43.570
 quite well 

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:45.340
 There are problems especially with names and 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:47.020
 in foreign-language words 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:50.200
 you can see it mainly by the name 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:52.930
 vss is and which app always to where 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:55.420
 is textet error we can directly here 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:57.880
 edit the gaps down here in the text 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:00.520
 when I was new line and newer 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:02.560
 paragraph said when we are done 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:04.149
 Let's click on the top right corner 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:05.100
 Button and can the message 

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:07.570
 to ship 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:10.170
 the app allows you to record 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:13.780
 send by e-mail twitter sms 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:16.060
 imessage to facebook the copy in 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:19.420
 the clipboard or another 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:20.799
 app like dropbox or an office at her 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:22.989
 See all this works a lot 

00:02:20.799 --> 00:02:25.239
 uncomplicated I break the whole but 

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:28.650
 now off and show you still completely 

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:28.650
 short the options 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:35.650
 here you can the language of 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:38.710
 set voice recognition white 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:42.600
 assistant supports 22 languages 

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:48.150
 including Danish Dutch French 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:48.150
 Spanish Russian and of course English 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:59.739
 also you can in the options 

00:02:57.849 --> 00:03:03.129
 adjust that the end of the recording 

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:05.379
 automatically gets noticed only leaves 

00:03:03.129 --> 00:03:07.930
 a signal when starting and ending the 

00:03:05.379 --> 00:03:10.120
 recording and receiving help 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:17.800
 an overview of all spoken commands 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:20.349
 that you can give all in all 

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:22.780
 I was very positive about the app and 

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:24.670
 does exactly what she should and also in 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:26.799
 the app description stands and that in 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:28.690
 a surprisingly good quality who 

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:30.069
 So like to dictate news for the 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:32.440
 This app is a neat one 

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:34.329
 alternative to siri where it is and 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:36.880
 works relatively reliable 

00:03:34.329 --> 00:03:39.220
 uncomplicated and fast and gets 

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:40.989
 so four stars from me as always 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:43.090

 another app or hold her 

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:51.730
 speech recognition generally still too 

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:54.010
