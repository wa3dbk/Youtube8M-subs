00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:02.600 
this little thing right here and our

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:07.979 
this little thing right here and our

00:02:07.989 --> 00:02:10.630 
flares we have that one's yellow and
this<00:02:08.989> one<00:02:09.229> this<00:02:09.769> one's<00:02:10.009> really<00:02:10.190> old<00:02:10.280> it's

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640 
this one this one's really old it's

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:12.580 
this one this one's really old it's
green<00:02:10.940> and<00:02:11.300> you<00:02:11.540> can<00:02:11.569> see<00:02:11.720> it's<00:02:12.019> it's<00:02:12.290> bulb

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590 
green and you can see it's it's bulb

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:14.680 
green and you can see it's it's bulb
doubt<00:02:12.860> so<00:02:13.670> I<00:02:13.700> don't<00:02:14.000> think<00:02:14.209> this<00:02:14.300> one<00:02:14.480> would

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:14.690 
doubt so I don't think this one would

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:17.860 
doubt so I don't think this one would
work<00:02:14.720> too<00:02:15.230> well<00:02:15.380> right<00:02:16.030> there<00:02:17.030> see<00:02:17.720> it<00:02:17.810> only

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870 
work too well right there see it only

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:19.860 
work too well right there see it only
goes<00:02:18.110> in<00:02:18.260> that<00:02:18.410> far

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 
goes in that far

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:22.050 
goes in that far
probably<00:02:20.870> it's<00:02:20.989> still<00:02:21.170> work<00:02:21.380> though<00:02:21.560> because

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060 
probably it's still work though because

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:24.759 
probably it's still work though because
these<00:02:23.060> some<00:02:23.329> white<00:02:23.600> phosphorus<00:02:23.810> rounds<00:02:24.590> will

00:02:24.759 --> 00:02:24.769 
these some white phosphorus rounds will

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:28.630 
these some white phosphorus rounds will
will<00:02:25.370> shoot<00:02:25.640> a<00:02:25.850> extremely<00:02:26.720> high<00:02:27.370> 5,000<00:02:28.370> degree

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:28.640 
will shoot a extremely high 5,000 degree

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:31.120 
will shoot a extremely high 5,000 degree
