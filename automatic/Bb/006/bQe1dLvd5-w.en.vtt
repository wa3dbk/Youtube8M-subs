00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
short enough so that it's not going to

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.340 
short enough so that it's not going to
rip<00:01:24.090> through<00:01:24.360> the<00:01:24.450> back<00:01:24.630> ear<00:01:24.840> board<00:01:25.140> during

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
your wipeout so what I'm going to do

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.120 
your wipeout so what I'm going to do
here<00:01:27.450> is<00:01:27.570> pull<00:01:27.780> it<00:01:27.810> over<00:01:28.080> whereas<00:01:28.860> right<00:01:29.070> now

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
here is pull it over whereas right now

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.520 
here is pull it over whereas right now
it<00:01:29.520> seems<00:01:29.759> a<00:01:29.880> little<00:01:30.030> bit<00:01:30.270> long<00:01:30.509> so<00:01:30.810> your<00:01:31.290> two

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
it seems a little bit long so your two

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.130 
it seems a little bit long so your two
choices<00:01:31.799> are<00:01:32.610> to<00:01:32.850> either<00:01:33.090> shorten<00:01:33.750> up<00:01:33.869> this

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
choices are to either shorten up this

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.310 
choices are to either shorten up this
string<00:01:34.500> by<00:01:35.090> adjusting<00:01:36.090> the<00:01:36.270> not<00:01:36.450> here<00:01:36.869> to

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
string by adjusting the not here to

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:38.899 
string by adjusting the not here to
shorten<00:01:37.710> it<00:01:37.770> up<00:01:37.890> which<00:01:38.189> is<00:01:38.220> what<00:01:38.549> I'm<00:01:38.670> going<00:01:38.880> to

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
shorten it up which is what I'm going to

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:42.440 
shorten it up which is what I'm going to
do<00:01:39.380> to<00:01:40.380> make<00:01:40.560> it<00:01:40.590> fall<00:01:41.400> at<00:01:41.729> a<00:01:41.759> shorter<00:01:42.180> spot

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
do to make it fall at a shorter spot

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.889 
do to make it fall at a shorter spot
just<00:01:42.750> like<00:01:42.840> so<00:01:43.170> or<00:01:43.890> you<00:01:44.759> can<00:01:44.970> pull<00:01:45.240> it<00:01:45.390> up<00:01:45.509> just

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899
