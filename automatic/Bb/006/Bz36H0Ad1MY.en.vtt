change<00:00:41.399> to<00:00:41.550> a<00:00:41.760> landscape<00:00:42.359> orientation<00:00:42.570> where

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
change to a landscape orientation where

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.130 
change to a landscape orientation where
it's<00:00:43.530> a<00:00:44.039> little<00:00:44.159> easier<00:00:44.579> to<00:00:44.850> read<00:00:45.030> so<00:00:45.780> this<00:00:46.109> is

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
it's a little easier to read so this is

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.349 
it's a little easier to read so this is
great<00:00:46.469> because<00:00:47.159> I<00:00:47.429> can<00:00:47.460> participate<00:00:48.149> in<00:00:48.300> the
