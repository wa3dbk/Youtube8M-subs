00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:25.820
 binder fog rises and the leaves 

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:32.870
 then fall for many 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:35.000
 sorry question not so martin blum he 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:37.339
 stays his wire in winter too 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:44.030
 I was loyal to the whole year with the 

00:00:37.339 --> 00:00:46.729
 bike temperatures of plus ten degrees 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:49.790
 up to minus 15 degrees, however, very 

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:51.409
 rarely and in all these circumstances 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:53.360
 is actually quite good radon 

00:00:51.409 --> 00:00:56.059
 the best course is when the weather 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:59.150
 Dry is discussing this topic 

00:00:56.059 --> 00:01:02.030
 experts and guests at 55 the turkish 

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:04.850
 bike house we are not built 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:06.500
 for just feeling good and only that we 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:08.119
 have no appeal but quite the 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.100
 body is sometimes required and that 

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:13.130
 also sat down in the demand of the 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:15.500
 Body survey daily 20 minutes 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:17.680
 Cycling depends on the winter 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:20.170
 body fit and strengthens the defenses 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:22.880
 Of course, only with the right clothes 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:24.890
 what do in the beginning maybe wrong 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:26.930
 I like what I warm too much 2-run 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:28.700
 the bike is moving and through 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:30.740
 movement is already why 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:33.590
 so you do not have to overdo it 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:35.770
 Gloves are important Good shoes are 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:37.970
 important and something upside down though 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:38.659
 otherwise it would not now 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:41.570
 exaggerate 

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:44.180
 So in onion look so neither us 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:46.159
 cold yet were in front of him with the 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:49.130
 Smooth roadway especially in wet 

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:51.650
 manhole covers and stir when you 're at 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:53.570
 the mature let out the air 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:55.869
 so that the footprint and thus 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:59.090
 the friction and it even stronger from 

00:01:55.869 --> 00:02:01.500
 slipping away and thus increasing 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:03.570
 also the safety when cycling 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:06.000
 Special attention is from the 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:08.310
 pay nothing extra reflectors 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.679
 that can freeze out of that is that 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:13.440
 I also personally joined in the 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:14.100
 winter months one match mine 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.140
 bag 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:19.290
 which means I hardly even amends a 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:20.850
 break after having done this a few times 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:21.540
 I've done it 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:22.980
 determined 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:24.870
 Now we see that the equipment is in 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:26.940
 to do winter ahead 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:27.840
 be on the road and not on the care 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:42.720
 to forget 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:45.959
 especially the roadway will be the people 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:50.190
 Everything can be broken faster 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:52.980
 possible cost so in the winter makes the 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:56.340
 driver once again a two years 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:59.070
 older regular in the chain around the 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:01.350
 rest cleaning will cost you another wheel 

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:03.380
 her body and we stay in the world too 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:08.480
 winter also get yourself track 

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:08.480
 Try it out very important
