00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:53.680 
we step up to the free-throw line we're

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:55.140 
we step up to the free-throw line we're
thinking<00:02:53.950> the<00:02:54.010> same<00:02:54.160> thing<00:02:54.220> let's<00:02:54.730> make<00:02:54.910> and

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.150 
thinking the same thing let's make and

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:57.180 
thinking the same thing let's make and
you<00:02:55.870> know<00:02:55.989> guys<00:02:56.170> stepped<00:02:56.530> up<00:02:56.739> you<00:02:57.069> know

hopefully if we would have missed all
the<00:02:58.780> free<00:02:58.930> throws<00:02:59.110> we<00:02:59.290> would<00:02:59.440> have<00:02:59.530> picked<00:02:59.799> it

00:02:59.880 --> 00:02:59.890

00:03:04.979 --> 00:03:04.989 
helped us today Duke scores just 29

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:06.600 
helped us today Duke scores just 29
points<00:03:05.470> that<00:03:05.860> shot<00:03:06.010> just<00:03:06.220> thirty<00:03:06.430> five

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:06.610 
points that shot just thirty five

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:08.009

percent<00:03:06.640> in<00:03:07.030> the<00:03:07.120> second<00:03:07.450> half<00:03:07.569> what

00:03:08.009 --> 00:03:08.019 
percent in the second half what

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:09.600 
percent in the second half what
defensively<00:03:08.560> did<00:03:08.769> you<00:03:08.890> guys<00:03:09.040> do<00:03:09.220> to<00:03:09.250> cause<00:03:09.489> him

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:09.610 
defensively did you guys do to cause him

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:11.610 
defensively did you guys do to cause him
some<00:03:09.760> trouble<00:03:09.940> oh<00:03:10.239> I<00:03:11.019> think<00:03:11.290> the<00:03:11.500> biggest

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:11.620 
some trouble oh I think the biggest

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:13.110 
some trouble oh I think the biggest
thing<00:03:11.829> especially<00:03:12.310> when<00:03:12.549> planning<00:03:12.940> it's<00:03:13.060> a

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:13.120 
thing especially when planning it's a

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:14.729 
thing especially when planning it's a
phenomenal<00:03:13.570> team<00:03:13.810> like<00:03:14.019> Duke<00:03:14.200> is<00:03:14.410> just<00:03:14.590> trying

00:03:14.729 --> 00:03:14.739 
phenomenal team like Duke is just trying

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:16.590 
phenomenal team like Duke is just trying
to<00:03:14.799> make<00:03:14.950> him<00:03:15.070> uncomfortable<00:03:15.370> and<00:03:15.850> I'll<00:03:16.450> run

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:16.600 
to make him uncomfortable and I'll run

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:18.090 
to make him uncomfortable and I'll run
them<00:03:16.750> off<00:03:16.870> the<00:03:16.900> spots<00:03:17.290> where<00:03:17.530> they<00:03:17.650> you<00:03:17.920> know<00:03:17.980> I

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:18.100 
them off the spots where they you know I

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:19.410 
them off the spots where they you know I
really<00:03:18.370> you<00:03:18.880> know<00:03:18.910> shooting<00:03:19.269> a<00:03:19.329> high

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:19.420 
really you know shooting a high

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:20.699 
really you know shooting a high
percentage<00:03:19.570> that<00:03:19.930> I<00:03:19.989> think<00:03:20.320> the<00:03:20.410> different

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:20.709 
percentage that I think the different

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:21.960 
percentage that I think the different
defenses<00:03:21.160> we<00:03:21.280> were<00:03:21.340> able<00:03:21.400> to<00:03:21.519> throw<00:03:21.670> out<00:03:21.820> them

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:21.970 
defenses we were able to throw out them

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:24.060 
defenses we were able to throw out them
you<00:03:22.540> know<00:03:22.690> coach<00:03:23.079> definitely<00:03:23.320> surprises<00:03:23.950> with

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:24.070 
you know coach definitely surprises with

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:25.410 
you know coach definitely surprises with
those<00:03:24.280> but<00:03:24.640> you<00:03:24.790> know<00:03:24.880> something<00:03:25.120> that<00:03:25.299> we've

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:25.420 
those but you know something that we've

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:27.300 
those but you know something that we've
been<00:03:25.510> practicing<00:03:25.750> and<00:03:26.560> I<00:03:26.650> think<00:03:26.859> today<00:03:27.040> we

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:27.310 
been practicing and I think today we

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:29.340 
been practicing and I think today we
were<00:03:27.400> really<00:03:27.549> able<00:03:27.640> to<00:03:27.850> just<00:03:28.030> execute<00:03:28.480> a<00:03:28.510> life
