00:00:01.509 --> 00:00:04.210
 per hundred position now we will do the test 

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:08.900
 d the functions of kim send and receive image 

00:00:09.409 --> 00:00:10.529
 for one hundrerd 

00:00:10.529 --> 00:00:15.379
 there are those who started jumping that evo not to be able to activate these holidays 

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:18.329
 options is necessary to be within 

00:00:18.329 --> 00:00:20.189
 a group 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:23.249
 between them as we explained in it before it 

00:00:23.249 --> 00:00:26.249
 expressed that if we make sure that within the local network 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.640
 percent avai at least they are contact that this percent receive 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:33.600
 less receive or send an image 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.610
 the second thing to highlight is that 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.820
 to be able to send an image there must be someone already 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.560
 willing to receive it is to say to someone already prepared eye with we turn to be 

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:45.639
 now what 

00:00:45.639 --> 00:00:49.560
 finally receive if this option is not that at the end 

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:55.420
 nela because you are not going to be able to send an image then we are going to be 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:56.430
 ovary 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.810
 that is, the one that is going to receive the image 

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:01.000
 we click on recife image 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.120
 and a window will be displayed 

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:07.410
 is that he will ask us for a directory where we will save the images 

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:10.430
 poses we are going to look for a directory 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:14.440
 let's go to this and the bad image percent receive 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:16.300
 which is a basic folder 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:20.730
 here we have a port by default that is the one that we will be to receive the 

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:22.970
 image and that has to be the same 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:24.750
 I stayed percent 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.930
 put him the the young via telematics then let's put in on missions 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:30.850
 genetic 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:34.590
 and tells us that this is ready and waiting for problems 

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:38.110
 so let's go now 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:41.500
 in our second soriano 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:43.310
 and he is going to send an image 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:46.360
 so let's see what he wants to be the first 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:47.170
 i 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:49.360
 asks us in this case 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:54.310
 the following data that is the former mayor Perez that in this case then the 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:57.800
 10 points 5 points whistles 106 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:01.580
 the motorbike parterre the same as the one that activated 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:03.860
 the transceiver 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:09.359
 In the feed where the image is, we are all going to look for it in this case 

00:02:09.359 --> 00:02:12.829
 is in sending images and that is the image that we are going to send 

00:02:12.829 --> 00:02:13.969
 let's render 

00:02:13.969 --> 00:02:16.969
 We were going on tracks 

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:22.399
 per hundred gives us 

00:02:22.399 --> 00:02:27.189
 a box that tells us that the connection and sending were made of 

00:02:27.189 --> 00:02:29.449
 successful way this means that she 

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:34.689
 our receivers have the image on your computer in this case we press 

00:02:34.689 --> 00:02:34.879
 much
