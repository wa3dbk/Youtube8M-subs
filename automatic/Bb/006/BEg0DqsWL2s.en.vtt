fans might be pretty ecstatic about it
and<00:00:23.369> they<00:00:23.430> should<00:00:23.490> be<00:00:23.820> coming<00:00:24.390> out<00:00:24.510> of<00:00:24.600> Miami

and they should be coming out of Miami
one-one<00:00:25.529> they<00:00:25.920> might<00:00:26.130> even<00:00:26.220> feel<00:00:26.430> like<00:00:26.490> they

certainly<00:00:28.289> Game<00:00:28.500> one<00:00:28.710> was<00:00:28.859> a<00:00:28.890> real<00:00:29.130> close<00:00:29.400> one

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
certainly Game one was a real close one

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.400 
certainly Game one was a real close one
that<00:00:29.880> could<00:00:30.029> have<00:00:30.119> gone<00:00:30.210> either<00:00:30.269> way<00:00:30.779> however

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
that could have gone either way however

what<00:00:31.800> Coach<00:00:32.009> Vogel<00:00:32.489> is<00:00:32.579> doing<00:00:33.059> is<00:00:33.210> playing<00:00:33.750> his

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
what Coach Vogel is doing is playing his

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.200 
what Coach Vogel is doing is playing his
starters<00:00:34.410> twice<00:00:34.739> as<00:00:34.950> many<00:00:35.130> minutes<00:00:35.399> as<00:00:35.670> the

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
starters twice as many minutes as the

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.360 
starters twice as many minutes as the
Heat<00:00:36.450> starters<00:00:36.960> when<00:00:37.440> I<00:00:37.500> think<00:00:37.739> that<00:00:37.860> does<00:00:38.129> is

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
Heat starters when I think that does is

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.250 
Heat starters when I think that does is
gives<00:00:38.670> the<00:00:39.030> pace<00:00:39.239> for<00:00:39.390> some<00:00:39.510> continuity<00:00:40.020> and

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
gives the pace for some continuity and

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.770 
gives the pace for some continuity and
rhythm<00:00:40.680> with<00:00:40.829> their<00:00:40.980> lineups<00:00:41.579> whereas<00:00:41.940> coach

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
rhythm with their lineups whereas coach

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.600 
rhythm with their lineups whereas coach
Spoelstra<00:00:43.050> seems<00:00:43.620> to<00:00:43.710> be<00:00:43.770> running<00:00:44.190> guys<00:00:44.340> in

Spoelstra seems to be running guys in

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.310 
Spoelstra seems to be running guys in
and<00:00:44.789> out<00:00:44.910> and<00:00:45.120> not<00:00:45.180> playing<00:00:45.629> anybody<00:00:45.870> long

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
and out and not playing anybody long

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.410 
and out and not playing anybody long
enough<00:00:46.620> to<00:00:46.710> get<00:00:46.860> a<00:00:46.920> rhythm<00:00:47.160> going<00:00:47.340> and<00:00:47.969> that's

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
enough to get a rhythm going and that's

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.330 
enough to get a rhythm going and that's

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
very well well also we looked at in Game

very well well also we looked at in Game
one<00:00:53.969> the<00:00:54.510> Heat<00:00:54.960> offense<00:00:55.469> and<00:00:55.680> what<00:00:55.829> they<00:00:55.949> were

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949

he's good enough and can handle the ball
just<00:06:05.780> about<00:06:06.050> well<00:06:06.260> enough<00:06:06.530> and<00:06:06.740> finished

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:07.130 
just about well enough and finished

00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:09.100 
just about well enough and finished
because<00:06:07.610> he's<00:06:07.970> seven<00:06:08.330> inches<00:06:08.690> taller<00:06:08.960> than

00:06:17.419 --> 00:06:19.000 
him get such open freedom to the rim but
by<00:06:17.570> the<00:06:17.630> way<00:06:17.930> they<00:06:18.169> also<00:06:18.350> have<00:06:18.560> a<00:06:18.620> problem<00:06:18.830> with

00:06:20.539 --> 00:06:22.029

they also have a problem if they have to

00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:26.020 
they also have a problem if they have to

have LeBron James guard David West as

00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:28.960 
have LeBron James guard David West as
well<00:06:26.210> because<00:06:26.720> West<00:06:27.380> can<00:06:27.620> draw<00:06:27.979> fouls<00:06:28.310> and<00:06:28.729> get

good post up looks all day so it's a

00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:32.750 
real interesting problem

00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:34.899 
real interesting problem
the<00:06:32.930> heat<00:06:33.169> solution<00:06:33.890> seems<00:06:34.220> to<00:06:34.400> be<00:06:34.490> the<00:06:34.610> jam

00:06:34.899 --> 00:06:34.909 
the heat solution seems to be the jam

00:06:34.909 --> 00:06:36.339 
the heat solution seems to be the jam
the<00:06:35.090> guards<00:06:35.510> and<00:06:35.599> trying<00:06:35.840> to<00:06:35.930> pressure<00:06:36.110> them

00:06:36.339 --> 00:06:36.349 
the guards and trying to pressure them

00:06:36.349 --> 00:06:37.350 
the guards and trying to pressure them
into<00:06:36.380> enough<00:06:36.770> turnover

00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:37.360 
into enough turnover

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:39.149 
into enough turnover
but<00:06:37.479> to<00:06:37.599> know<00:06:37.750> what<00:06:37.960> the<00:06:38.439> Pacers<00:06:38.710> have<00:06:38.949> turned

00:06:39.149 --> 00:06:39.159 
but to know what the Pacers have turned

00:06:39.159 --> 00:06:41.399 
but to know what the Pacers have turned
it<00:06:39.250> over<00:06:39.310> at<00:06:39.520> a<00:06:39.580> high<00:06:39.789> rate<00:06:40.120> but<00:06:40.719> as<00:06:40.840> shot<00:06:41.139> well

00:06:41.399 --> 00:06:41.409 
it over at a high rate but as shot well

00:06:41.409 --> 00:06:43.499 
it over at a high rate but as shot well
enough<00:06:41.710> to<00:06:42.099> be<00:06:42.219> in<00:06:42.400> Game<00:06:42.669> one<00:06:42.699> and<00:06:42.909> probably

00:06:43.499 --> 00:06:43.509 
enough to be in Game one and probably

00:06:43.509 --> 00:06:45.089 
enough to be in Game one and probably
almost<00:06:43.750> kind<00:06:44.199> of<00:06:44.289> could<00:06:44.620> have<00:06:44.710> won<00:06:44.889> that<00:06:45.039> and

00:06:45.089 --> 00:06:45.099 
almost kind of could have won that and

00:06:45.099 --> 00:06:47.339 
almost kind of could have won that and
certainly<00:06:45.789> a<00:06:45.849> Game<00:06:46.060> two<00:06:46.270> they<00:06:46.419> won<00:06:46.659> that<00:06:46.870> so

00:06:47.339 --> 00:06:47.349 
certainly a Game two they won that so

00:06:47.349 --> 00:06:49.320 
certainly a Game two they won that so
