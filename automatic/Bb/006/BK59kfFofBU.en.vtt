00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.590

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.180
 time more home things like you know this 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.310
 The company is also dedicated to reassessing 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.890
 heap the architecture has many years 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.570
 in Peru he threw the story that 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.340
 this year and it's up to this house 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.380
 the house lives a house in the center of 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.119
 Lima is in fact located on the street 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.529
 Nativity scene and good, I really invite you 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.910

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.650
 Of course as you come to not connect 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.180
 all environments that have a 

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:38.129
 excellent proposal of each of the 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.080
 designers not only in the house music 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:42.449
 but also the brown house highlights the 

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:44.129
 cost in many environments gordillo 

00:00:42.449 --> 00:00:46.879
 we are going to present you happy and 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.879
 I hope the building 

00:00:54.520 --> 00:01:00.280
 also made with Carlos 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:00.280
 this is the lawyer's desk 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:08.620
 but I always love air series like this 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:11.450
 as being up white sky 

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:13.430
 all clear 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:14.780
 all that is height all I know 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:18.909
 we have kept original moldings 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:18.909
 they are also coming in the environment 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:27.580
 this writer of all the structures 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:29.590
 in steel and is the board is in marble 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:36.240
 we are also looking for a piece of marble 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:36.240
 allowed embroideries 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.950
 we wanted to find just the proportion not 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:44.759
 that is great that as I go too 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.759
 we had this great height 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:53.190
 and in these the walls we have worked 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:55.470
 also with photography with black though 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:58.140
 with francisco and this great mirror in 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:00.950
 steel also endorsed to reflect 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.950
 the lamp 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.440
 we wanted to break the whole issue a bit 

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:07.780
 classic and put some good and more 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:09.970
 designed funnier than it deducted 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:12.400
 with the legs but already with the trades and 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:15.070
 in all the services they are different in 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:16.480
 the same tone texture and how can 

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:18.850
 be the detail of the backup with 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:21.450
 different angles and what to break 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:23.800
 the whole angle 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:26.590
 documented the same nutrition 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:29.020
 seats also corners with their have 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:30.760
 the detail of the captain the no and good and 

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:34.510
 the two carpets that these leather 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:36.610
 all in white tones and is alpaca 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:39.960
 I wish I do not like what controls a bit 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:39.960
 the cold of the desk 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:47.739
 they have also made brillito 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:50.250
 and it's a design but I do not know it's not so 

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:50.250
 wrong 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:03:02.920
 often as a good space my travel 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:02.920
