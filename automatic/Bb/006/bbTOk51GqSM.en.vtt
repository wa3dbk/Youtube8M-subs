certain weapons there is a chance that
you<00:02:18.880> will<00:02:19.880> knock<00:02:20.209> their<00:02:20.420> body<00:02:20.570> parts<00:02:20.630> off<00:02:21.049> say

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:21.320 
you will knock their body parts off say

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:26.530 
you will knock their body parts off say
heads<00:02:22.040> will<00:02:22.519> come<00:02:22.700> on<00:02:23.140> limbs<00:02:24.140> like<00:02:24.880> arms<00:02:25.880> but

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540 
heads will come on limbs like arms but

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:29.560 
heads will come on limbs like arms but
um<00:02:26.750> it<00:02:27.440> depends<00:02:28.130> on<00:02:28.340> what<00:02:28.790> what<00:02:29.150> weapon<00:02:29.450> you

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:29.570 
um it depends on what what weapon you

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:34.180 
um it depends on what what weapon you
use<00:02:29.810> so<00:02:30.470> swords<00:02:31.070> and<00:02:31.600> I<00:02:32.600> believe<00:02:33.230> axes<00:02:33.890> have

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:34.190 
use so swords and I believe axes have

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:36.220 
use so swords and I believe axes have
the<00:02:34.430> highest<00:02:34.760> chance<00:02:35.269> of<00:02:35.480> knocking<00:02:35.720> off<00:02:35.989> body

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
the highest chance of knocking off body

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:40.210 
the highest chance of knocking off body
parts<00:02:36.290> while<00:02:37.280> our<00:02:37.489> arrows<00:02:38.920> spades<00:02:39.920> and

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:40.220 
parts while our arrows spades and

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:43.479 
parts while our arrows spades and
pickaxes<00:02:40.790> are<00:02:41.120> second<00:02:41.630> to<00:02:41.690> those<00:02:42.190> and<00:02:43.190> as<00:02:43.340> you

00:02:43.479 --> 00:02:43.489 
pickaxes are second to those and as you

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:49.930 
pickaxes are second to those and as you
can<00:02:43.670> also<00:02:44.030> tell<00:02:44.660> I<00:02:46.840> like<00:02:47.840> the<00:02:47.930> summer<00:02:48.940> but

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:49.940 
can also tell I like the summer but

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:53.770 
can also tell I like the summer but
instead<00:02:51.220> they<00:02:52.220> also<00:02:52.430> draw<00:02:52.970> blood<00:02:53.209> when<00:02:53.660> you

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:53.780 
instead they also draw blood when you

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:57.009 
instead they also draw blood when you
knock<00:02:54.170> body<00:02:54.380> parts<00:02:54.650> off<00:02:54.799> and<00:02:55.660> you<00:02:56.660> can<00:02:56.690> knock

00:02:57.009 --> 00:02:57.019
