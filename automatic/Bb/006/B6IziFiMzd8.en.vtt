00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.800
 paty cantÃº to tell us a little 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.650
 on his new video of the simple luck 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.320
 how are you very well very happy and I 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.939
 I want to take the pink armchair to my house 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:25.590
 I am if you want and can change my 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:27.570
 luck and I have to take the site 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.369
 then it 's simple very popular already have 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.140
 wanted to kidnap what they have wanted today 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.780
 take it to many others since 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:37.140
 a while ago for his room boys 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:39.450
 tachos is the boy and I already left 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.070
 luck is that that's what I was going to 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.380
 tell how good this is the second 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.820
 simple of my disco bipolar heart is 

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:46.260
 a very different song heart 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.850
 bipolar and very different to each of 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.820
 the songs on this album because all 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.770
 they touch different topics from the typical 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.720
 intense drama that I can not help myself 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:57.300
 how is it hopefully it's a song in 

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:58.740
 the one who lives mind I declared myself a coward 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.180
 not dare to leave someone who does not 

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:02.490
 I did more than wait when I felt 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.079
 ok but to be feeling bad 

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:05.729
 songs like sideboard that also 

00:01:04.079 --> 00:01:08.220
 love good maria barracuda girl goodbye 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:10.229
 and we are like a little revealing ourselves before 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.479
 stereotypes that we not late 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:14.250
 what to see because the pictures are very 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.720
 small parameters and it is not worth 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.340
 they want us all to fit there all 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.409
 we are different proud 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.450
 and good luck is a song that is 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:23.039
 cheerful is a song that if not pearls 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.859
 the letter d you can have fun these 

00:01:23.039 --> 00:01:28.979
 good but yes but the letter I the 

00:01:25.859 --> 00:01:30.960
 I composed a little as if making an allusion 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:32.429
 that sometimes when you close a door 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.280
 of something that looks good but in 

00:01:32.429 --> 00:01:36.719
 reality is bad you turn around and you 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.939
 you find a window that takes you to 

00:01:36.719 --> 00:01:40.439
 something much better not just in love 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:42.119
 in anything in life in the 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:43.679
 dreams at work on anything 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:47.069
 not there the video because it does not try 

00:01:43.679 --> 00:01:49.739
 exactly from a loving story of 

00:01:47.069 --> 00:01:51.420
 couple but rather it is a reflection 

00:01:49.739 --> 00:01:52.890
 of what at least I feel is 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.509
 the relationship between the public and the 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.459
 artist that 's fine is not father 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:57.869
 because apart it 's like a fan not a 

00:01:56.459 --> 00:02:00.390
 Chat a fan that enters your 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:02.700
 concert and there it is as drying that 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.500
 wave to see to start you are like 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.540
 some specific band that you 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.000
 do you think so for me 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:10.100
 yes of course there are many people who 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.340
 I admire very much and that if I 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:15.140
 I meet on the street, I would not know if 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:16.700
 I would like to find the exact words 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:18.820
 so that my friends would be made in five 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:21.680
 minutes later for composing with them or 

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:24.140
 hear them make music the case of the video is 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:25.880
 that was recorded in the village theater of 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:28.160
 Mexico City 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:29.570
 the truth yes yes yes it has many years 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:31.040
 then the truth is that it has this 

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:32.420
 vibrates like retro father that I think 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:34.910
 they also have many songs of this 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:36.980
 disco wanted it to be something very natural 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:38.300
 very real then is my band with the 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:39.800
 I'm doing the tour that is the 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:42.350
 band that is with me whenever they are 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:43.730
 my family are really rehearsing 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:47.360
 playing the lucky song when 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:49.780
 this little girl that is part of fact is 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:49.780
 my niece 

00:02:54.490 --> 00:03:01.670
 2010 painful actually said I stole camera 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:03.890
 almost not very natural my father caught them 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:05.900
 the director this although it sounds like that 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:07.370
 It is not true and very nice because 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:09.920
 it represented a little bit I have this 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:11.150
 relationship not of artist and fan and what 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:13.939
 happens is that she 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:15.260
 ok it's okay we left the stage and 

00:03:13.939 --> 00:03:16.790
 suddenly we made this story 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:18.200
 we fed that came from the school that 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:19.640
 I was in love with the biggest chavito 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:21.049
 because women do not know how to fall in love 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:24.220
 but since we have four and the boy 

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:24.220
 he says fucking girls 

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:34.480
 and then the chelito is in love 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:36.970
 big that obviously did not pay attention 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:38.560
 then he arrives and suddenly she wants 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:39.790
 sing the song because it's left because 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:42.430
 I tell the story of his life and suddenly 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:45.730
 he realizes in being aware that he is 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:47.260
 totally alone in this theater and he 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:48.940
 removes all inhibitions and a 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:51.430
 song and a moment and a dream you 

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:52.840
 change luck and this part of the end 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:54.489
 where I applauded him from the audience 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:56.409
 also for me it was representative of 

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:58.030
 so if I could and today I applauded 

00:03:56.409 --> 00:04:00.040
 each one of you and held your hand 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:01.720
 that to you in your homes well thank you 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:03.879
 thank you thank you because you change 

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:07.000
 my luck to me let me live my dream and 

00:04:03.879 --> 00:04:08.590
 rant to clear taste for example in 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.950
 the song gives me a lot of laughter 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:13.810
 says something like that first you're already 

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:16.239
 fed up and you say I do not fall in love anymore 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:18.340
 never again and we always pass the truth to 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:21.260
 all that to repeat it I do not want 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:23.120
 have boyfriend to the first handsome 

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:26.000
 as if I like you have to walk with 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:27.920
 him and then the same thing happens and always 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.210
 bad is a little bit is a little 

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:31.580
 irony but it 's real 

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:33.860
 what happens to all of us the truth is that 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:35.690
 this is the one that I can stand 

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:37.760
 louts for being so good that is a 

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:40.880
 little as sarcasm is to say for being so 

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:42.440
 good not to be so stupid and this and this 

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:44.390
 good roll because it must be like no 

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:46.250
 I care about your past that obviously 

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:48.290
 it bothers me and I want to hit him 

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:52.130
 action to hit to give cache passes all 

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:54.350
 the things that you gave me country this no no 

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:56.540
 no and suddenly I warn you that I am a 

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:59.050
 promise of a lot of drama now I loved it 

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:59.050
 any woman 

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:04.170
 yes 

00:05:04.889 --> 00:05:12.810
 and how good it is after luck 

00:05:10.949 --> 00:05:14.490
 I do not know is because the fans sometimes arrive 

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:16.660
 a point where you are visualized as if 

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:19.570
 you were a superheroine you say 

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:22.030
 I am not a normal person that I like 

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:24.160
 throwing laziness since it's like the most 

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:26.170
 you say no more lazy than you like 

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:28.420
 do it on a weekend that you do the 

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:30.550
 I really enjoy my work and for 

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:32.320
 it's not work but on a free day 

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:35.230
 I can do from putting to compose 

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:38.170
 songs that would be work but I have 

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:40.990
 not until I say I'm going to watch movies I'm going to 

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:42.820
 eat popcorn like crazy 

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:45.849
 I suddenly like to go to concerts 

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:47.830
 other people suddenly I like 

00:05:45.849 --> 00:05:49.119
 literally it would be to walk or find me some 

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:52.059
 thing such as for example fair trade 

00:05:49.119 --> 00:05:53.619
 I found this book very cool this I do not know no 

00:05:52.059 --> 00:05:54.789
 I know everything is different but but what 

00:05:53.619 --> 00:05:55.869
 what I did is it is very true in the end 

00:05:54.789 --> 00:05:58.330
 It has often been suggested that the 

00:05:55.869 --> 00:06:00.279
 artist is like this role of perfection 

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:01.659
 non-existent that just also causes 

00:06:00.279 --> 00:06:03.639
 a lot of people a lot of pressure if 

00:06:01.659 --> 00:06:05.289
 I want to be as such I have to be able to 

00:06:03.639 --> 00:06:07.059
 buy clothes like that and I have to 

00:06:05.289 --> 00:06:08.619
 can see me if what they can do to 

00:06:07.059 --> 00:06:09.639
 surgery, I have to be able, it's not true, 

00:06:08.619 --> 00:06:12.699
 it's like that 

00:06:09.639 --> 00:06:15.339
 I am a woman like you like everyone and I 

00:06:12.699 --> 00:06:17.199
 love to also represent what 

00:06:15.339 --> 00:06:18.909
 better that I do not know because I have my nose 

00:06:17.199 --> 00:06:21.429
 girl, I have my faults, I have my things 

00:06:18.909 --> 00:06:25.149
 but I love myself as I am and I also know 

00:06:21.429 --> 00:06:26.679
