00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:09.090
 the place of your operators requests there 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.710
 it's the assassin's creed logo but there 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:11.940
 has about a dozen others and the 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.769
 all without jailbreak 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.750
 so go on the computer so there we 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:18.600
 is on my mac is you have that at 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.490
 open the dmg that will be in the 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.980
 description 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:26.070
 so there are two there is a folder a 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:28.439
 application there it will be the record yes to 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.830
 everything you can put at the 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:33.380
 place of the name of the operator 

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:36.079
 for example, I have the assassin's creed 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:39.510
 that's it but we'll see that later 

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:42.510
 so just go back 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:47.850
 finally I'm just going to hop open 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:48.960
 the application that we do not care 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.230
 do what you want but see me 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.820
 but john jack and there you go 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:59.190
 in the child the information of 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:01:02.000
 the iphone and after the name of the network 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:06.409
 it will be marked in figures me it's 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:09.570
 13,20 points 1 so marc do that but 

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:12.840
 for example it's with 13.5 so 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.590
 you mark your vote well 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.670
 any of them 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:20.189
 So here is his walk for iphone 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.560
 and ipad who have 3g because it takes 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:24.240
 there is a number of operators 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:25.950
 then you go get your name 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.310
 operators 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:33.390
 so me it's orange swiss hop there he 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:38.960
 are the oranje once there he is there domenech 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:42.270
 what are you there you're going to put the two 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:43.680
 finally the logo you want but each 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:47.790
 times there are two so I'm going 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:51.509
 put the triforce there for example up of 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:53.490
 m there is there and it's the same for windows 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:57.149
 except that for windows you have the option 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.689
 to also put like that or put a 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:59.759
 text 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:03.329
 so this is otherwise the same you 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:06.329
 go put compile career update and 

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:10.420
 so here's normally you see that 

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:13.270
 to marcq sahamies two small files 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:16.989
 so that's me, I do not care about that 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:18.599
 we're going to leave because we have to 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:21.819
 will go on itunes 

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:26.470
 so here it is the original it is the one that 

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:38.860
 if you want to reset and you 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:41.849
 go go on your iphone here I 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:41.849
 just cut that little bit 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:53.810
 to be on your iphone and you're going 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:56.720
 restore restore iphone restore 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:59.530
 the iphone by pressing alt and there you 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:01.760
 go pick up on your desk 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:04.970
 the original treatment is you 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:09.830
 reset an old one or be the 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:20.960
 custom and there you have m open saffron 

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:22.820
 very little time here is me it's good there 

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:25.370
 it's over, that's it 

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:27.110
 synchronization but it's already finished 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:30.080
 the logo appeared on my iphone i 

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:33.980
 see there and so if it did not seem you 

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:35.630
 just have to pretend to turn it back on and 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:39.880
 here you are I hope you will have
