walking around you know mud and

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:32.970 
walking around you know mud and
everything<00:03:31.389> probably<00:03:32.199> later<00:03:32.379> on<00:03:32.530> but<00:03:32.709> at<00:03:32.919> the

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:32.980 
everything probably later on but at the

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:35.309 
everything probably later on but at the
moment<00:03:33.099> let's<00:03:33.540> carry<00:03:34.540> on<00:03:34.629> and<00:03:35.049> see<00:03:35.290> what

00:03:35.309 --> 00:03:35.319 
moment let's carry on and see what

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:38.879 
moment let's carry on and see what
exactly<00:03:36.159> we<00:03:36.280> got<00:03:36.459> here<00:03:37.349> now<00:03:38.349> you<00:03:38.409> can<00:03:38.650> see<00:03:38.859> that

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:38.889 
exactly we got here now you can see that

00:03:38.889 --> 00:03:41.550 
exactly we got here now you can see that
the<00:03:39.310> two<00:03:39.639> screws<00:03:40.269> in<00:03:40.750> the<00:03:40.930> back<00:03:40.959> of<00:03:41.409> the

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:41.560 
the two screws in the back of the

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:45.629 
the two screws in the back of the
battery<00:03:42.069> cover<00:03:43.379> so<00:03:44.379> we<00:03:44.409> actually<00:03:44.919> have<00:03:45.310> to<00:03:45.489> go

00:03:45.629 --> 00:03:45.639 
battery cover so we actually have to go

00:03:45.639 --> 00:03:50.129 
battery cover so we actually have to go
on<00:03:45.879> and<00:03:46.199> cons<00:03:47.199> for<00:03:47.500> those<00:03:47.769> to<00:03:48.750> get<00:03:49.750> a<00:03:49.780> pretty

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:50.139 
on and cons for those to get a pretty

00:03:50.139 --> 00:03:55.530 
on and cons for those to get a pretty
big<00:03:50.459> such<00:03:51.459> thing<00:03:51.819> here<00:03:53.760> let<00:03:54.760> me<00:03:54.970> and<00:03:55.150> screw

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:55.540 
big such thing here let me and screw

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:59.580 
big such thing here let me and screw
this<00:03:57.269> it's<00:03:58.269> really<00:03:58.599> hard<00:03:58.870> to<00:03:58.989> use<00:03:59.139> two<00:03:59.349> things

00:03:59.580 --> 00:03:59.590 
this it's really hard to use two things

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:07.869 
this it's really hard to use two things
together

00:04:07.869 --> 00:04:07.879 

00:04:07.879 --> 00:04:10.849 

it's<00:04:08.879> already<00:04:09.180> starting<00:04:09.900> to<00:04:10.079> this<00:04:10.230> very<00:04:10.469> heavy

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:10.859 
it's already starting to this very heavy

00:04:10.859 --> 00:04:19.939 
it's already starting to this very heavy
duty<00:04:17.000> well<00:04:18.000> you<00:04:18.449> can<00:04:18.630> see<00:04:18.840> that<00:04:19.199> two<00:04:19.500> screws

00:04:19.939 --> 00:04:19.949 
duty well you can see that two screws

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:25.450 
duty well you can see that two screws
here<00:04:20.720> and<00:04:22.550> as<00:04:23.550> you<00:04:23.610> can<00:04:23.880> see<00:04:23.910> it<00:04:24.240> got<00:04:24.419> me<00:04:24.990> to

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:25.460 
here and as you can see it got me to

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:28.310 
here and as you can see it got me to
this<00:04:26.460> white<00:04:26.789> line<00:04:27.060> is<00:04:27.300> actually<00:04:27.750> at<00:04:27.990> rubber

this white line is actually at rubber

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:31.900 
this white line is actually at rubber
thing<00:04:28.590> which<00:04:28.889> actually<00:04:29.100> makes<00:04:29.460> it<00:04:29.580> waterproof

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:31.910 

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:36.760 

okay<00:04:32.930> then<00:04:33.930> we<00:04:34.110> got<00:04:34.289> this<00:04:34.699> compartment<00:04:35.699> for

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:36.770 
okay then we got this compartment for

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:42.770 
okay then we got this compartment for
the<00:04:40.370> stem<00:04:41.370> and<00:04:41.610> the<00:04:41.699> number<00:04:42.060> card<00:04:42.270> memory<00:04:42.479> card

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:42.780 
the stem and the number card memory card

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:45.890 
the stem and the number card memory card
is<00:04:42.900> not<00:04:43.050> included<00:04:43.440> case<00:04:43.740> so<00:04:44.630> catch<00:04:45.630> a<00:04:45.750> better

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:45.900 
is not included case so catch a better

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:48.439 
is not included case so catch a better
prepared<00:04:46.320> for<00:04:46.380> getting<00:04:46.830> a<00:04:46.889> battery<00:04:47.250> a<00:04:47.520> better

00:04:48.439 --> 00:04:48.449 
prepared for getting a battery a better

00:04:48.449 --> 00:04:50.540 
prepared for getting a battery a better
letter<00:04:48.660> is<00:04:48.750> a<00:04:48.810> cute<00:04:48.990> if<00:04:49.320> memory<00:04:50.190> is<00:04:50.340> not<00:04:50.400> that

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:50.550 
letter is a cute if memory is not that

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:52.520 
letter is a cute if memory is not that
bad<00:04:50.849> either<00:04:51.090> but<00:04:51.270> having<00:04:51.780> an<00:04:51.900> MV<00:04:52.139> or<00:04:52.169> something

just exaggerating right let's get this
one's<00:05:05.630> going<00:05:06.630> to<00:05:06.690> go<00:05:06.750> n<00:05:10.520> let's<00:05:11.520> relate<00:05:11.729> this

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:14.120 

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:35.640

entropy is clear jar beast and mother

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:09.180 
entropy is clear jar beast and mother
okay<00:06:00.820> let's<00:06:01.820> see

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:09.190
