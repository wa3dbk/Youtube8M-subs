00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:12.420
 Ah I like the face of his presence 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:15.089
 in the neighborhood this diversity of the 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:19.140
 garden apartments is that one of the skip 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:21.090
 to the other has plant you look 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:24.710
 apartments saw buildings and see that it 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:27.710
 have a green daily setting 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:27.710
 differentiated 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:39.890
 this project a lot so middle of the village 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:43.030
 to a small plot in a region 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:46.280
 is very restrictive in terms of 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:48.860
 constructive potential then he gives it 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:51.530
 a building with a maximum of eight floors 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:54.230
 we end up making a decision 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:59.449
 make an apartment a little more 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:01:04.269
 elaborate, people have just arrived 12 72 

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:06.470
 and 80 on the right foot of the kabanda support 

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:12.049
 a ball in so people 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:14.240
 appreciated this decision but the people 

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:18.590
 ended up in a two-way solution 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:23.690
 apartments per floor a little larger 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:25.280
 that the other one of them is 181 840 meters 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:30.170
 about 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:35.540
 the ground which was narrow in the 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:38.840
 whose most beautiful sight was 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:42.020
 a view of the university city and 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:45.470
 to the setting sun is one stayed more at 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:48.380
 other side got more ahead more 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:50.450
 the two have the same position the room 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:53.420
 being and the main areas of the 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:58.700
 apartment enjoy the same landscape 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:02:02.690
 in the same way, we have made a 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:05.330
 that the two apartments would have the 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:07.250
 room forward but so that you 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:10.129
 catch the ground narrowed if you have a 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:12.920
 dormitory of one here with you divide 

00:02:10.129 --> 00:02:16.010
 in three parts the construction of 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:19.940
 dorms of the first apartment here 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:22.220
 arriving in the room after the other room 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:27.019
 here arriving in the dorms means 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:29.590
 hugging the body of the building that is the 

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:29.590
 ladder and elevator 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:39.910
 We always think a lot about 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:43.810
 tasty open apartment facing 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:46.260
 the view to open for sunshine never 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:47.680
 lighting many ventilated areas 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:51.880
 illuminated 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:55.120
 was interesting because we noticed 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:58.330
 another fundamental point that is the 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:03:00.220
 question whether these two rooms are 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:01.690
 looking ahead one will see 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:04.480
 Other then we had to do 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:08.530
 some architectural element that 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:10.170
 stop that look down privacy 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:14.410
 from one to the other 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:19.360
 At that time , the idea of ​​a protector 

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:22.360
 solar nenão brizzi a facade brizzi 

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:23.260
 which also did not solve the issue of the sun 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:27.660
 west 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:30.970
 we worked on a metal grid of 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:34.170
 running like brizzi a reticulate 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:38.190
 in both directions a grid that 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:42.430
 that protects the sun late in the incident 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:47.049
 in the social area and on the balcony 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:49.180
 this metallic brizzi facade that makes 

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:52.840
 all the difference both comfort 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:55.510
 thermal comfort and privacy 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:58.750
 we thought a lot about a structure of the 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:04:02.140
 apartment that reduces flexibility to 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:07.060
 the future resident makes the interventions that 

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:10.239
 It made me so it's a slab independent of 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:13.180
 the structure is 

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:16.390
 on the outskirts of the building and leaves 

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:21.390
 the independent free social area to 

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:21.390
 take a wall raise room 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:30.950
 the residence is gaining more and more 

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:34.790
 this importance of oasis so is of 

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:37.640
 place where people come and need 

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:40.570
 feel very well the person needs 

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:40.570
 like to get home
