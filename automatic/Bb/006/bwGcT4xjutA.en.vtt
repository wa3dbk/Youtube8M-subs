roll<00:05:13.600> so<00:05:13.840> you<00:05:13.900> have<00:05:14.200> a<00:05:14.230> run<00:05:14.530> on<00:05:14.560> it<00:05:14.950> I<00:05:15.280> would<00:05:16.000> see

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:16.240 
roll so you have a run on it I would see

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:21.030 
roll so you have a run on it I would see
nine<00:05:16.600> of<00:05:16.810> them<00:05:17.020> nine<00:05:17.320> to<00:05:17.530> ten<00:05:17.740> pieces<00:05:20.040> often

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:21.040 
nine of them nine to ten pieces often

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:31.020 
nine of them nine to ten pieces often
they<00:05:21.160> are<00:05:25.890> 13<00:05:26.890> minutes<00:05:29.010> and<00:05:30.010> like<00:05:30.280> I<00:05:30.460> said<00:05:30.520> just

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:31.030 
they are 13 minutes and like I said just

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:34.320 
they are 13 minutes and like I said just
test<00:05:31.660> at<00:05:31.990> around<00:05:32.380> 10<00:05:32.830> to<00:05:33.040> 11<00:05:33.580> minutes<00:05:33.880> to<00:05:34.120> see

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:34.330 
test at around 10 to 11 minutes to see

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:37.080 
test at around 10 to 11 minutes to see
that<00:05:34.570> they<00:05:34.690> are<00:05:34.720> not<00:05:35.340> browning<00:05:36.340> too<00:05:36.729> fast

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:37.090 
that they are not browning too fast

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:39.750 
that they are not browning too fast
because<00:05:37.570> we<00:05:38.050> want<00:05:38.320> a<00:05:38.500> good<00:05:38.740> crust<00:05:39.100> on<00:05:39.400> it<00:05:39.460> but

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:39.760 
because we want a good crust on it but

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:42.510 
because we want a good crust on it but
we<00:05:39.850> don't<00:05:40.030> want<00:05:40.210> them<00:05:40.330> to<00:05:40.479> go<00:05:41.039> so<00:05:42.039> taking<00:05:42.400> the

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:42.520 
we don't want them to go so taking the

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:44.850 
we don't want them to go so taking the
rolls<00:05:42.789> out<00:05:42.940> of<00:05:42.970> the<00:05:43.060> oven<00:05:43.180> and<00:05:43.630> I<00:05:44.200> waited<00:05:44.680> for

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:44.860 
rolls out of the oven and I waited for

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:47.250 
rolls out of the oven and I waited for
just<00:05:45.220> over<00:05:45.370> 14<00:05:45.880> minutes<00:05:46.240> and<00:05:46.419> I<00:05:46.840> kept<00:05:47.050> them<00:05:47.169> on

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:47.260 
just over 14 minutes and I kept them on

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:49.950 
just over 14 minutes and I kept them on
the<00:05:47.410> counter<00:05:47.860> so<00:05:48.250> that<00:05:48.460> as<00:05:48.700> we<00:05:48.760> sit<00:05:49.300> they<00:05:49.690> also

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:49.960 
the counter so that as we sit they also

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:52.980 
the counter so that as we sit they also
cook<00:05:50.289> a<00:05:50.410> little<00:05:50.530> bit<00:05:50.680> extra<00:05:51.100> and<00:05:51.810> they<00:05:52.810> also

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:52.990 
cook a little bit extra and they also

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:55.230 
cook a little bit extra and they also
cool<00:05:53.320> off<00:05:53.500> and<00:05:53.680> so<00:05:53.830> it's<00:05:53.979> easier<00:05:54.340> to<00:05:54.460> handle<00:05:54.640> in

00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:55.240 
cool off and so it's easier to handle in

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:57.659 
cool off and so it's easier to handle in
taking<00:05:55.930> it<00:05:55.990> out<00:05:56.140> on<00:05:56.169> a<00:05:56.410> serving<00:05:56.800> tray<00:05:56.830> and<00:05:57.250> here
