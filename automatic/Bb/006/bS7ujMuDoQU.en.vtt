00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:34.030 
first of all the design we believe is

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:36.090 
first of all the design we believe is
one<00:00:34.239> of<00:00:34.330> the<00:00:34.420> most<00:00:35.260> impressive<00:00:35.589> things<00:00:35.980> about

the frames very slick design it's a

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:41.299 
the frames very slick design it's a
little<00:00:39.220> different<00:00:39.400> from<00:00:39.730> what<00:00:40.660> you've<00:00:40.780> seen

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309

Outman<00:00:42.309> market<00:00:42.610> so<00:00:42.760> far<00:00:43.030> with<00:00:43.300> the<00:00:43.540> typical

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:44.140 
Outman market so far with the typical

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:46.950 
Outman market so far with the typical
frame<00:00:44.620> this<00:00:45.100> is<00:00:45.309> a<00:00:45.339> very<00:00:45.640> sleek<00:00:46.120> slim<00:00:46.750> design

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:46.960 
frame this is a very sleek slim design

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:49.859 
frame this is a very sleek slim design
and<00:00:47.800> let<00:00:47.980> me<00:00:48.100> turn<00:00:48.460> it<00:00:48.640> sideways<00:00:49.299> so<00:00:49.659> you<00:00:49.720> can

00:00:49.859 --> 00:00:49.869 
and let me turn it sideways so you can

00:00:49.869 --> 00:00:52.380 
and let me turn it sideways so you can
see<00:00:50.019> how<00:00:50.049> slim<00:00:51.010> it<00:00:51.100> is<00:00:51.159> from<00:00:51.339> the<00:00:51.460> side<00:00:51.699> so<00:00:52.210> the

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:52.390 
see how slim it is from the side so the

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:55.619 
see how slim it is from the side so the
7<00:00:53.170> inch<00:00:53.260> over<00:00:53.500> here<00:00:53.890> and<00:00:54.549> the<00:00:54.790> 9<00:00:55.000> and<00:00:55.030> share<00:00:55.600> a

frames<00:01:12.070> can<00:01:12.369> accept<00:01:12.790> up<00:01:13.030> to<00:01:13.090> forty<00:01:13.600> eight

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:13.720 
frames can accept up to forty eight

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:16.800 
frames can accept up to forty eight
megapixel<00:01:14.470> images<00:01:14.950> but<00:01:15.640> at<00:01:15.759> that<00:01:15.909> size<00:01:16.180> it

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:16.810 
megapixel images but at that size it

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:19.320 
megapixel images but at that size it
could<00:01:17.080> eat<00:01:17.380> up<00:01:17.560> internal<00:01:18.040> memory<00:01:18.400> so<00:01:19.030> there<00:01:19.240> is

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:19.330 
could eat up internal memory so there is

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:21.660 
could eat up internal memory so there is
an<00:01:19.479> option<00:01:19.689> where<00:01:20.470> you<00:01:20.500> can<00:01:20.740> have<00:01:21.070> it<00:01:21.190> downsize

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:21.670 
an option where you can have it downsize

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:25.170 
an option where you can have it downsize
your<00:01:21.820> photos<00:01:22.240> to<00:01:22.930> about<00:01:23.140> 1.5<00:01:24.010> megapixel<00:01:24.850> level

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:25.180 
your photos to about 1.5 megapixel level

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:28.020 
your photos to about 1.5 megapixel level
which<00:01:25.660> is<00:01:25.690> HD<00:01:26.200> equivalent<00:01:26.800> but<00:01:27.790> it<00:01:27.910> will

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:28.030 
which is HD equivalent but it will

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:29.700 
which is HD equivalent but it will
maximize<00:01:28.720> your<00:01:28.840> internal<00:01:29.200> memory<00:01:29.440> that<00:01:29.620> way

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:29.710 
maximize your internal memory that way

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:31.170 
maximize your internal memory that way
from<00:01:30.040> the<00:01:30.160> card<00:01:30.370> it's<00:01:30.550> going<00:01:30.670> to<00:01:30.730> downsize

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:31.180 
from the card it's going to downsize

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:32.399 
from the card it's going to downsize
them<00:01:31.390> and<00:01:31.450> put<00:01:31.659> them<00:01:31.690> and<00:01:31.960> save<00:01:32.140> them<00:01:32.170> into

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:32.409 
them and put them and save them into

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:35.160 
them and put them and save them into
memory<00:01:32.650> exactly<00:01:33.340> yeah<00:01:33.700> so<00:01:34.390> this<00:01:34.600> model<00:01:34.930> here

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:35.170 
memory exactly yeah so this model here

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:38.010 
memory exactly yeah so this model here
it<00:01:35.409> has<00:01:35.740> some<00:01:35.920> step-up<00:01:36.310> features<00:01:36.930> included<00:01:37.930> is

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:38.020 
it has some step-up features included is

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:40.800 
it has some step-up features included is
an<00:01:38.260> hdmi<00:01:38.860> output<00:01:39.280> so<00:01:39.970> he<00:01:40.150> connected<00:01:40.540> to<00:01:40.600> your
