also we have selected a diamond ores and

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.850 
also we have selected a diamond ores and
whenever<00:00:45.480> you<00:00:45.780> do<00:00:46.020> something<00:00:46.050> say<00:00:46.620> for

example right click or left click and
punch<00:00:48.930> you'll<00:00:49.440> actually<00:00:49.739> yet<00:00:50.190> emit<00:00:50.760> a<00:00:50.940> sort<00:00:51.360> of

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
punch you'll actually yet emit a sort of

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.560 
punch you'll actually yet emit a sort of
particle<00:00:51.840> effect<00:00:52.350> and<00:00:53.090> once<00:00:54.090> you<00:00:54.210> omit<00:00:54.449> the

particle effect and once you omit the
particle<00:00:54.989> effect<00:00:55.260> it'll<00:00:55.500> go<00:00:55.620> straight<00:00:56.010> to

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
particle effect it'll go straight to

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.819 
particle effect it'll go straight to
that<00:00:56.219> closest<00:00:57.000> or<00:00:57.270> that<00:00:57.899> can<00:00:58.140> be<00:00:58.260> found<00:00:58.530> so<00:00:58.739> if

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
that closest or that can be found so if

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.459 
that closest or that can be found so if
we<00:00:58.949> go<00:00:59.129> away<00:00:59.280> and<00:00:59.780> far<00:01:00.780> off<00:01:00.809> into<00:01:01.109> the<00:01:01.230> distance

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
we go away and far off into the distance

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.080 
we go away and far off into the distance
I<00:01:01.800> wonder<00:01:02.160> if<00:01:02.250> yeah<00:01:02.579> here<00:01:02.820> we<00:01:02.850> go

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
I wonder if yeah here we go

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.450 
I wonder if yeah here we go
so<00:01:03.600> now<00:01:03.809> shooting<00:01:04.500> down<00:01:04.650> the<00:01:04.799> particles<00:01:05.280> are

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
so now shooting down the particles are

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.190 
so now shooting down the particles are
shooting<00:01:05.909> down<00:01:06.090> that<00:01:06.119> it's<00:01:06.479> some<00:01:06.750> went<00:01:06.960> down

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
shooting down that it's some went down

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.429 
shooting down that it's some went down
here<00:01:07.650> so<00:01:08.220> uh<00:01:08.250> look<00:01:09.150> at<00:01:09.240> this<00:01:09.360> we<00:01:09.540> can<00:01:09.570> even<00:01:10.200> mine

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
here so uh look at this we can even mine

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.830 
here so uh look at this we can even mine
down<00:01:10.740> and<00:01:10.950> it<00:01:11.070> continues<00:01:11.670> going<00:01:12.180> down<00:01:12.600> that

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
down and it continues going down that

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.109 
down and it continues going down that

telling<00:01:21.570> us<00:01:21.659> to<00:01:21.869> keep<00:01:22.049> keep<00:01:22.590> on<00:01:22.710> going<00:01:23.040> down

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
telling us to keep keep on going down

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.370 
telling us to keep keep on going down
and<00:01:23.490> since<00:01:24.060> we're<00:01:24.299> clicking<00:01:24.509> it<00:01:24.810> keeps<00:01:25.140> on

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
and since we're clicking it keeps on

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:30.350 
and since we're clicking it keeps on
re-emitting<00:01:26.369> the<00:01:27.330> signal<00:01:28.110> and<00:01:28.430> is<00:01:29.430> that<00:01:29.670> up<00:01:30.119> or

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360

iron ore and we shall hear we have iron
so<00:02:20.290> there<00:02:21.290> we<00:02:21.440> go<00:02:21.470> directly<00:02:22.130> pinpoints<00:02:22.850> to<00:02:23.030> the

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:23.120 
so there we go directly pinpoints to the

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.330 
so there we go directly pinpoints to the
closest<00:02:23.540> iron<00:02:23.810> we<00:02:23.990> can<00:02:24.140> see<00:02:24.380> so<00:02:24.590> that<00:02:24.830> is<00:02:25.310> a
