00:00:04.549 --> 00:00:08.849
 So the point I propose to you 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:09.840
 see this month is about the organization 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:11.460
 of your season 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.889
 so how to program his season 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:16.170
 first you have to be able to judge yourself 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:18.380
 to find out what you can do in 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:22.170
 terms of objectives we will identify 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:23.939
 three types of runners the one who 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.800
 is not sporty one who is athletic 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:29.220
 but who is not runners and finally 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:31.109
 to finish we'll see what happens 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.000
 goes to the runner level so at 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:35.100
 level of your training program 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.800
 you will have to determine a 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.540
 training frequency namely the 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.340
 number of training sessions per week 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.309
 find out if you're going to run twice 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:47.250
 per week three times four times 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:49.289
 more depending of course on our 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:52.649
 family professional opportunities 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:54.030
 and your experience with the activity 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:56.760
 so everyone can make a 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:59.010
 marathon but on the other hand there will be a 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.859
 deadline to be respected because the one 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.870
 no athlete not runner will not be able 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:06.450
 initially envisaged in the short 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.480
 term to achieve a marathon it takes 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.670
 about 

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:13.040
 two years of practice to consider 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:13.520
 seriously a marathon and even the 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:15.740
 finish 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:18.620
 at first this type of two 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:21.560
 people will be able to participate in 

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:24.590
 popular races 10 km and before 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:26.870
 switch to the well- controlled marathon 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:30.080
 the distance of the half marathon 

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:33.620
 concerning the athlete who already practices 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:35.120
 an interesting physical activity is 

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:39.830
 not in running 

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:42.940
 he can have an apprenticeship more 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:46.580
 fast compared to the marathon to know 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:48.800
 we're going to say a six-eight month delay is 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:51.260
 conceivable in order to launch a 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:53.210
 goal compared to the marathon and 

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:55.670
 finally to finish the one that is already 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:57.290
 runners it is necessary to consider very 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:02.090
 reasonably to participate in a 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:04.210
 marathon in I would say about 3 to 4 months 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:06.410
 with proper preparation and 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:08.270
 consider finishing in good 

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:10.160
 conditions so depending on 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:13.180
 the goal you have determined for 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:16.090
 your season you are scheduled 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:16.859
 races that will prepare you for this 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:19.480
 goal 

00:02:16.859 --> 00:02:21.340
 if we take the example of the marathon you 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:23.680
 will ask during your season 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:25.989
 rains milestones that will be benchmarks 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:28.810
 in your progress at the level of 

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:30.450
 your training then will be important 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:35.739
 to do a half marathon 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:36.780
 a few weeks before your goal 

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:40.810
 main 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:43.569
 it can be done between 3 to 5 weeks 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:45.609
 before so this one will allow you to 

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:47.680
 gauge yourself against your state of 

00:02:45.609 --> 00:02:48.370
 shape whether to redo anything 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:51.310
 thing behind 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:52.870
 or rather take advantage of these 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:55.150
 weeks to recover before your 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:57.639
 goal so of course in your 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:03:00.519
 training phase to your goal 

00:02:57.639 --> 00:03:02.079
 you will generate fatigue but he 

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:04.120
 should not neglect periods of 

00:03:02.079 --> 00:03:07.359
 recoveries over a season ago 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:10.060
 important to give ourselves periods of 

00:03:07.359 --> 00:03:10.560
 recovery because the activity 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:13.680
 physical 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:15.540
 brings us muscle fatigue but 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:17.550
 also a general tiredness and the body has 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:20.940
 need to regenerate so especially 

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:22.500
 do not forget to take a period of 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:24.630
 recovery behind each big 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:25.500
 objective therefore regarding this period 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:27.480
 recovery 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:30.300
 you can opt for a period of 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:32.670
 rest can go from simply 

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:35.810
 a few days to say ten days 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:38.610
 complete shutdown you can also 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:42.180
 add the practice of swimming is 

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:43.830
 also the bike that will allow you to 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:45.630
 to work other muscles and 

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:47.370
 to aerate you a bit to change the 

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:49.620
 practice of running so 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:51.060
 about your goal is heard on 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:53.340
 will identify two types of runners 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:56.849
 those who run in search of the 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:58.890
 performance and others for the pure 

00:03:56.849 --> 00:04:01.769
 enjoy the practice to a little yesterday 

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:02.970
 so some very flat courses you 

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:03.599
 will make great 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:06.569
 performances 

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:09.000
 while other more typed courses 

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:11.459
 nice type tourist canes along 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:15.600
 the Mediterranean Sea or the marathon 

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:17.910
 Medoc with a festive atmosphere all 

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:20.489
 like cassis marseille will allow you 

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:23.600
 to discover places in France 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:23.600
 very friendly
