00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
and there's no way Sutherland promotions

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:11.750

will<00:02:10.319> take<00:02:10.500> that<00:02:10.709> risk<00:02:10.920> I'm<00:02:11.160> pretty<00:02:11.640> sure

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
will take that risk I'm pretty sure

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.910 
will take that risk I'm pretty sure
Kubrat<00:02:12.120> Pulev<00:02:12.290> doesn't<00:02:13.290> want<00:02:13.410> to<00:02:13.500> take<00:02:13.590> that

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
Kubrat Pulev doesn't want to take that

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.949 
Kubrat Pulev doesn't want to take that
as<00:02:14.400> well<00:02:14.730> so<00:02:14.970> it's<00:02:15.150> probably<00:02:15.510> going<00:02:15.840> to<00:02:15.900> be

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:15.959 
as well so it's probably going to be

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:18.740 
as well so it's probably going to be
someone<00:02:16.500> that<00:02:16.770> we<00:02:17.310> know<00:02:17.340> he<00:02:17.640> can<00:02:17.790> be<00:02:17.970> that's<00:02:18.540> my

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
someone that we know he can be that's my

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:20.120 
someone that we know he can be that's my
guess<00:02:18.810> I<00:02:19.260> think<00:02:19.470> that's<00:02:19.590> who<00:02:19.709> he<00:02:19.890> will<00:02:20.010> be

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.130 
guess I think that's who he will be

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:23.449 
guess I think that's who he will be
fighting<00:02:20.420> whoever<00:02:21.420> may<00:02:21.989> be<00:02:22.050> top<00:02:22.440> maybe<00:02:22.860> top<00:02:23.099> 20

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:23.459 
fighting whoever may be top maybe top 20

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:25.160 
fighting whoever may be top maybe top 20
