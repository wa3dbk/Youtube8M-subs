00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:58.630 

these<00:02:57.140> I<00:02:57.260> think<00:02:57.290> of<00:02:57.560> booting<00:02:57.800> go<00:02:57.950> show<00:02:58.490> that

00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:58.640 
these I think of booting go show that

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:04.790 
so you can see how long the boot of

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:06.130 
so you can see how long the boot of
comments<00:03:05.120> you<00:03:05.210> can<00:03:05.240> see<00:03:05.420> that<00:03:05.450> this<00:03:05.750> surface
