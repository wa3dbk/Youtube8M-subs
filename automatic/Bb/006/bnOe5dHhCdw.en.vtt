00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.509
 We were alerted here to a truck 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:09.780
 burn on the bab 24 km 187 5 in 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:11.910
 direction berlin was alerted 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.080
 already said as I said that the plan 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.480
 to burn on league 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.980
 So, as we look at the development 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.380
 the highway we drove the 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.119
 big cloud of smoke already seen here 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.250
 in between came the already 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.779
 message that the truck was in full fire 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.269
 than we are here with the first one 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:29.010
 As mentioned , the truck arrived 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:31.080
 on the beach in full fire 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.610
 the complete plane says that 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.340
 complete relative fully loaded with 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.090
 foil foil roll and this stood 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.070
 already in full fire 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.379
 So for us, of course, was first 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.750
 The difficulty because this was the danger 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:45.360
 that the fire on the adjacent forest 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.219
 that was the first for us 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.100
 first the first measures we here 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:51.449
 had to protect the forest 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:54.390
 as he says and then we go on in the 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:56.219
 principle with with the extinguishing agent cavs order 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.329
 Here I say a cooling effect 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:59.460
 to achieve 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:01.230
 First, for the forest you say and then 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.449
 also accordingly for the 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.979
 surrounding ground and for the truck so 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:06.659
 why did both directions of travel were 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.939
 on arrival already locked the 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.710
 Vehicles from Berlin and Hamburg 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:12.479
 thing for the first vehicles was the 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.310
 rescue lane still halfway open 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.750
 but the last vehicles of the fire department 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.670
 who arrived at the place of employment 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.200
 have me as a fair and fire 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.659
 informed that the very bad 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.860
 was able to submit to a position was in 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:24.150
 principle the vehicles in the 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.340
 rescue lane all together again 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:29.640
 were driven and of course first 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:31.829
 loses again so that one stepped 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.299
 follow through the heat radiation the 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:35.009
 Place of employment is natural 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:36.780
 has been high accordingly 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:38.280
 still very high as you are here too 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.770
 can easily recognize and the comrades 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:43.259
 said here once pretty hard 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.149
 work and there under full protection 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:47.310
 work then you have to say that 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:48.810
 heat radiation does not attack too much 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.270
 on the other side in the 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:54.060
 course of travel berlin are, of course, too 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.710
 a delineator for bordering on the 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.270
 guardrail melted 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.979
 through this direction of travel 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.509
 Of course, fire engine also has 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:02.490
 a small damage 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:04.690
 but that is repairable that is not so 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:08.460
 but wild that says otherwise 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:08.460
 The camera does a very good job
