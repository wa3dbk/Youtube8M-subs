I<00:00:15.120> have<00:00:15.509> a<00:00:15.540> little<00:00:15.809> theory<00:00:16.170> for<00:00:16.320> you<00:00:16.410> guys

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:19.189 
I have a little theory for you guys
that's<00:00:16.680> a<00:00:16.800> pretty<00:00:16.980> crazy<00:00:17.340> theory<00:00:17.940> and<00:00:18.150> I<00:00:18.900> want

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
that's a pretty crazy theory and I want

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:21.080 
that's a pretty crazy theory and I want
you<00:00:19.260> guys<00:00:19.350> to<00:00:19.529> bear<00:00:19.710> with<00:00:19.949> me<00:00:20.130> on<00:00:20.160> this<00:00:20.340> this

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
you guys to bear with me on this this

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:22.880 
you guys to bear with me on this this
little<00:00:21.300> theory<00:00:21.750> that<00:00:21.869> I<00:00:21.930> have<00:00:22.140> for<00:00:22.410> you<00:00:22.470> guys<00:00:22.529> I

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
little theory that I have for you guys I

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.070 
little theory that I have for you guys I
came<00:00:23.430> up<00:00:23.550> with<00:00:23.670> a<00:00:23.699> Syria<00:00:24.210> right<00:00:24.449> after<00:00:24.750> I<00:00:24.810> heard

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
came up with a Syria right after I heard

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.839 
came up with a Syria right after I heard

trailer at the Nintendo Direct during e3
and<00:00:31.700> the<00:00:32.700> theory<00:00:33.030> I<00:00:33.059> have<00:00:33.300> for<00:00:33.450> you<00:00:33.480> guys<00:00:33.660> if

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
and the theory I have for you guys if

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.600 
and the theory I have for you guys if
you<00:00:33.930> guys<00:00:33.960> can<00:00:34.890> tell<00:00:35.010> by<00:00:35.130> the<00:00:35.190> title<00:00:35.370> of<00:00:35.489> the

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
you guys can tell by the title of the

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.040 
you guys can tell by the title of the
video<00:00:35.760> maybe<00:00:36.210> just<00:00:36.390> click<00:00:36.630> this<00:00:36.750> video

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
randomly but um yeah I have a theory

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.389 
randomly but um yeah I have a theory
that<00:00:39.780> this<00:00:40.050> character<00:00:40.559> that<00:00:40.739> we're<00:00:40.890> seeing<00:00:41.160> in

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
that this character that we're seeing in

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.220 
that this character that we're seeing in
the<00:00:41.579> game<00:00:41.760> in<00:00:42.030> the<00:00:42.090> trailer<00:00:42.570> which<00:00:43.020> actually

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
the game in the trailer which actually

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.130 
the game in the trailer which actually
is<00:00:43.590> not<00:00:43.920> CGI<00:00:44.820> guys<00:00:45.090> this<00:00:45.239> is<00:00:45.360> actual<00:00:45.809> gameplay

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
is not CGI guys this is actual gameplay

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.619 
is not CGI guys this is actual gameplay
as<00:00:46.920> confirmed<00:00:47.579> by<00:00:47.640> the<00:00:47.700> producer<00:00:48.239> of<00:00:48.270> the<00:00:48.450> game

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
as confirmed by the producer of the game

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.500 
as confirmed by the producer of the game
eg<00:00:49.050> a<00:00:49.079> NUMA<00:00:49.440> which<00:00:49.950> also<00:00:50.219> stated<00:00:50.850> that<00:00:50.879> no<00:00:51.329> one

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
eg a NUMA which also stated that no one

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.510 
eg a NUMA which also stated that no one
really<00:00:51.539> confirmed<00:00:52.530> that<00:00:52.770> this<00:00:52.890> character<00:00:53.370> we

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
really confirmed that this character we

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.080 
really confirmed that this character we
see<00:00:53.670> in<00:00:53.760> the<00:00:53.789> trailer<00:00:53.969> is<00:00:54.410> linked<00:00:55.410> so<00:00:55.980> um<00:00:56.370> we

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
see in the trailer is linked so um we

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.490 
see in the trailer is linked so um we
don't<00:00:57.210> know<00:00:57.480> if<00:00:57.600> this<00:00:57.719> is<00:00:57.750> actually<00:00:57.989> linked<00:00:58.379> or

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
don't know if this is actually linked or

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.529 
don't know if this is actually linked or
not<00:00:58.620> which<00:00:58.890> brings<00:00:59.190> me<00:00:59.340> to<00:00:59.460> a<00:00:59.640> theory<00:01:00.090> which

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
not which brings me to a theory which

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.119 
not which brings me to a theory which
I'll<00:01:00.750> tell<00:01:01.050> you<00:01:01.170> guys<00:01:01.289> about<00:01:01.500> in<00:01:01.770> this<00:01:01.920> video

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
I'll tell you guys about in this video

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:05.050 
I'll tell you guys about in this video
so<00:01:02.969> my<00:01:03.510> theory<00:01:03.840> is<00:01:03.989> that<00:01:04.170> this<00:01:04.439> is<00:01:04.500> obviously

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:05.060 
so my theory is that this is obviously

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:08.630 
so my theory is that this is obviously
links<00:01:06.060> son<00:01:06.540> and<00:01:06.860> I<00:01:07.860> don't<00:01:08.460> know<00:01:08.520> why<00:01:08.580> I<00:01:08.610> said

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
links son and I don't know why I said

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.600 
links son and I don't know why I said
obviously<00:01:09.000> but<00:01:09.540> um<00:01:09.570> yeah<00:01:10.290> links<00:01:10.710> son<00:01:10.950> we<00:01:11.340> play

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
obviously but um yeah links son we play

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.670 
obviously but um yeah links son we play
as<00:01:11.790> links<00:01:12.090> on<00:01:12.270> in<00:01:12.479> the<00:01:12.600> game<00:01:12.750> this<00:01:13.200> explains<00:01:13.500> a

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
as links on in the game this explains a

me please leave me a comment um I know
this<00:03:21.389> is<00:03:21.569> kind<00:03:21.810> of<00:03:21.870> a<00:03:22.019> weird<00:03:22.290> theory<00:03:22.620> it's<00:03:22.889> kind

00:03:23.059 --> 00:03:23.069 
this is kind of a weird theory it's kind

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:24.830 
this is kind of a weird theory it's kind
of<00:03:23.100> mind-boggling<00:03:23.579> and<00:03:24.030> it<00:03:24.120> takes<00:03:24.510> a<00:03:24.600> little

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:24.840 
of mind-boggling and it takes a little

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:26.930 
of mind-boggling and it takes a little
bit<00:03:25.079> to<00:03:25.290> get<00:03:25.500> used<00:03:25.560> to<00:03:25.920> but<00:03:26.190> who<00:03:26.730> knows<00:03:26.880> maybe

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:26.940 
bit to get used to but who knows maybe

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:30.080 
bit to get used to but who knows maybe
this<00:03:27.329> is<00:03:27.480> a<00:03:27.510> true<00:03:27.780> theory<00:03:28.200> um<00:03:28.410> but<00:03:29.340> yeah<00:03:29.549> link

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
this is a true theory um but yeah link
