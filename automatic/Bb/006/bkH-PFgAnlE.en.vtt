power is steadily maintain their craft
will<00:00:46.530> climb<00:00:46.829> steadily<00:00:47.300> but<00:00:48.300> then<00:00:48.629> to<00:00:48.840> be<00:00:48.989> sent

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
will climb steadily but then to be sent

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.290 
will climb steadily but then to be sent
just<00:00:49.530> reduced<00:00:49.980> the<00:00:50.219> power<00:00:50.550> all<00:00:50.910> the<00:00:50.940> way<00:00:51.239> to

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
just reduced the power all the way to

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.240 
just reduced the power all the way to
idle<00:00:51.780> and<00:00:52.020> the<00:00:52.350> aircraft<00:00:52.469> will<00:00:52.800> start<00:00:53.100> is

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
idle and the aircraft will start is

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.939 
idle and the aircraft will start is
ending<00:00:53.579> once<00:00:53.969> again<00:00:54.390> add<00:00:54.570> power<00:00:54.989> as<00:00:55.140> necessary

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
ending once again add power as necessary

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.610 
ending once again add power as necessary
to<00:00:56.219> maintain<00:00:56.370> an<00:00:56.850> optimum<00:00:57.480> age<00:00:57.660> of<00:00:57.899> 10<00:00:58.199> degrees

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
to maintain an optimum age of 10 degrees

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:05.060 
to maintain an optimum age of 10 degrees
below<00:00:58.910> zero<00:01:02.629> once<00:01:03.629> you<00:01:03.870> maintain<00:01:04.379> a<00:01:04.409> good<00:01:04.739> else

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
below zero once you maintain a good else

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.700 
below zero once you maintain a good else
turn<00:01:05.430> just<00:01:06.150> add<00:01:06.420> power<00:01:06.750> is<00:01:06.930> necessary<00:01:07.470> and

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
turn just add power is necessary and

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.859 
turn just add power is necessary and
then<00:01:07.920> just<00:01:08.250> reduce<00:01:08.640> it<00:01:08.850> again<00:01:09.180> to<00:01:09.390> maintain

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
then just reduce it again to maintain

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:15.030 
then just reduce it again to maintain
that<00:01:10.080> altitude

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:15.040 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:18.120 

turning<00:01:15.910> is<00:01:16.030> relatively<00:01:16.720> easy<00:01:16.980> compared<00:01:17.980> to

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:18.130 
turning is relatively easy compared to

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:20.760 
turning is relatively easy compared to
the<00:01:18.280> other<00:01:18.400> maneuvers<00:01:19.000> to<00:01:19.240> turn<00:01:19.840> you<00:01:20.350> simply<00:01:20.740> a

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:20.770 
the other maneuvers to turn you simply a

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:23.970 
the other maneuvers to turn you simply a
pro<00:01:21.070> at<00:01:21.310> power<00:01:21.640> to<00:01:22.360> one<00:01:22.540> side<00:01:22.840> and<00:01:23.350> then<00:01:23.530> reduce

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:23.980 
pro at power to one side and then reduce

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:26.670 
pro at power to one side and then reduce
the<00:01:24.010> power<00:01:24.310> on<00:01:24.580> the<00:01:24.730> other<00:01:24.850> side<00:01:25.180> but<00:01:25.900> again<00:01:26.350> as

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:26.680 
the power on the other side but again as

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:28.320 
the power on the other side but again as
i<00:01:26.830> told<00:01:26.890> you<00:01:27.130> to<00:01:27.220> maintain<00:01:27.520> a<00:01:27.760> specific

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:28.330 
i told you to maintain a specific

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:31.650 
i told you to maintain a specific
antigen<00:01:28.780> and<00:01:29.350> power<00:01:29.920> on<00:01:30.310> the<00:01:30.520> opposite<00:01:31.300> engine

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:31.660 
antigen and power on the opposite engine

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:34.140 
antigen and power on the opposite engine
as<00:01:31.870> necessary<00:01:32.500> and<00:01:33.160> then<00:01:33.370> the<00:01:33.700> aircraft<00:01:34.000> will

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:34.150 
as necessary and then the aircraft will

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:36.150 
as necessary and then the aircraft will
automatically<00:01:34.930> start<00:01:35.229> to<00:01:35.410> bank<00:01:35.650> and<00:01:35.920> then

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:36.160 
automatically start to bank and then

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:37.980 
automatically start to bank and then
turn<00:01:36.400> on<00:01:36.580> its<00:01:36.760> own<00:01:36.940> it<00:01:37.510> won't<00:01:37.810> be<00:01:37.960> a

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:37.990 
turn on its own it won't be a

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:39.960 
turn on its own it won't be a
coordinated<00:01:38.770> turn<00:01:38.979> but<00:01:39.220> it<00:01:39.250> will<00:01:39.580> get<00:01:39.729> you

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:39.970 
coordinated turn but it will get you

00:01:39.970 --> 00:02:15.180 
coordinated turn but it will get you
turning

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:15.190 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:17.850 

to<00:02:16.150> level<00:02:16.480> the<00:02:16.630> aircraft<00:02:16.990> don't<00:02:17.260> have<00:02:17.650> to

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:17.860 
to level the aircraft don't have to

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:20.310 
to level the aircraft don't have to
distant<00:02:18.400> power<00:02:18.700> to<00:02:19.120> the<00:02:19.240> opposite<00:02:19.630> side<00:02:19.900> and

distant power to the opposite side and

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:22.380 
distant power to the opposite side and
then<00:02:20.620> me<00:02:20.800> a<00:02:20.830> grand<00:02:21.130> prix<00:02:21.280> automatically<00:02:22.000> start

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
have to maintain power equal enough so

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:33.960 
have to maintain power equal enough so
that<00:02:31.450> the<00:02:31.810> aircraft<00:02:31.930> stays<00:02:32.560> level<00:02:32.890> at<00:02:33.580> a

aircraft<00:03:07.640> level<00:03:07.940> is<00:03:08.150> a<00:03:08.180> tough<00:03:08.480> job<00:03:08.690> and<00:03:09.020> it

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:09.110 
aircraft level is a tough job and it

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:12.400 
aircraft level is a tough job and it
requires<00:03:09.530> skill<00:03:10.430> practice<00:03:11.180> and<00:03:11.720> most

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:12.410 
requires skill practice and most

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:27.980 
requires skill practice and most
importantly<00:03:13.100> cuts

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:27.990 

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:31.230 

as<00:03:28.990> you<00:03:29.260> can<00:03:29.440> see<00:03:29.680> I'm<00:03:29.920> trying<00:03:30.190> to<00:03:30.460> fly<00:03:30.700> on<00:03:31.000> to<00:03:31.030> a

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:31.240 
as you can see I'm trying to fly on to a

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:33.150 
as you can see I'm trying to fly on to a
point<00:03:31.540> where<00:03:31.720> the<00:03:32.050> aircraft<00:03:32.200> can<00:03:32.680> we<00:03:32.890> just

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:33.160 
point where the aircraft can we just

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:35.580 
point where the aircraft can we just
turn<00:03:33.430> in<00:03:33.760> one<00:03:33.970> direction<00:03:34.180> to<00:03:34.870> straighten<00:03:35.440> up

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:35.590 
turn in one direction to straighten up

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:38.310 
turn in one direction to straighten up
with<00:03:35.800> the<00:03:35.950> runway<00:03:36.130> now<00:03:36.580> watch<00:03:37.480> as<00:03:37.720> I<00:03:37.870> turn<00:03:38.080> the

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:38.320 
with the runway now watch as I turn the

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:41.120 
with the runway now watch as I turn the
aircraft<00:03:38.790> you<00:03:39.790> can<00:03:39.970> see<00:03:40.240> that<00:03:40.270> the<00:03:40.840> aircraft

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:41.130 
aircraft you can see that the aircraft

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:43.410 
aircraft you can see that the aircraft
automatically<00:03:42.130> starts<00:03:42.670> to<00:03:42.850> turn<00:03:43.030> when<00:03:43.300> you

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:43.420 
automatically starts to turn when you

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:46.320 
automatically starts to turn when you
had<00:03:43.630> the<00:03:43.840> power<00:03:44.050> to<00:03:44.320> one<00:03:44.560> side<00:03:44.860> and<00:03:45.520> then<00:03:45.730> you

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:46.330 
had the power to one side and then you

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:49.170 
had the power to one side and then you
must<00:03:46.570> know<00:03:47.110> exactly<00:03:47.980> when<00:03:48.280> to<00:03:48.310> turn<00:03:48.670> otherwise

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:49.180 
must know exactly when to turn otherwise

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:50.880 
must know exactly when to turn otherwise
the<00:03:49.390> aircraft<00:03:49.720> will<00:03:49.900> start<00:03:50.350> to<00:03:50.470> hear<00:03:50.650> of

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:50.890 
the aircraft will start to hear of

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:53.310 
the aircraft will start to hear of
course<00:03:51.190> and<00:03:51.790> then<00:03:52.030> you<00:03:52.540> might<00:03:52.750> have<00:03:53.080> grown

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:53.320 
course and then you might have grown

00:03:53.320 --> 00:04:04.540 
course and then you might have grown
ditch<00:03:53.650> in<00:03:53.860> the<00:03:53.950> water

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:04.550 

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:07.970 

okay<00:04:05.550> now<00:04:05.730> i<00:04:05.760> am<00:04:06.060> at<00:04:06.210> the<00:04:06.420> maximum<00:04:06.930> at<00:04:07.260> optimum

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:07.980 
okay now i am at the maximum at optimum

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:10.490 
okay now i am at the maximum at optimum
point<00:04:08.190> so<00:04:08.520> i'm<00:04:08.640> trying<00:04:09.570> to<00:04:09.840> turn<00:04:10.020> onto<00:04:10.230> the

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:10.500 
point so i'm trying to turn onto the

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:12.890 
point so i'm trying to turn onto the
airport<00:04:10.860> and<00:04:11.130> then<00:04:11.640> you<00:04:12.180> can<00:04:12.360> see<00:04:12.570> the<00:04:12.720> runway

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:12.900 
airport and then you can see the runway

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:15.470 
airport and then you can see the runway
lights<00:04:13.290> just<00:04:13.560> add<00:04:13.860> now<00:04:14.400> maintaining<00:04:15.090> the

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:15.480 
lights just add now maintaining the

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:17.810 
lights just add now maintaining the
approach<00:04:15.870> will<00:04:16.109> be<00:04:16.290> the<00:04:16.500> hardest<00:04:17.220> made<00:04:17.519> since

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:17.820 
approach will be the hardest made since

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:20.470 
approach will be the hardest made since
you<00:04:17.970> have<00:04:18.150> to<00:04:18.329> maintain<00:04:18.510> both<00:04:18.930> altitude<00:04:19.739> and

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:20.480 
you have to maintain both altitude and

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:24.770 
you have to maintain both altitude and
the<00:04:21.650> turn<00:04:22.650> and<00:04:22.920> keep<00:04:23.730> level<00:04:24.090> with<00:04:24.240> the<00:04:24.390> run<00:04:24.570> by

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:24.780 
the turn and keep level with the run by

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:29.840 
the turn and keep level with the run by
using<00:04:24.990> only<00:04:25.440> the<00:04:26.070> engines<00:04:28.310> almost<00:04:29.310> every<00:04:29.610> time

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:29.850 
using only the engines almost every time

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:31.370 
using only the engines almost every time
you<00:04:30.030> learned<00:04:30.270> a<00:04:30.390> hydraulic<00:04:30.870> this<00:04:31.080> plane

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:31.380 
you learned a hydraulic this plane

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:34.610 
you learned a hydraulic this plane
aircraft<00:04:31.770> rule<00:04:32.250> and<00:04:32.490> probably<00:04:33.240> knows<00:04:33.600> down<00:04:34.050> so

aircraft rule and probably knows down so

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:36.890 
aircraft rule and probably knows down so
you<00:04:34.680> must<00:04:35.040> be<00:04:35.220> careful<00:04:35.640> and<00:04:36.210> try<00:04:36.420> to<00:04:36.540> approach

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:36.900 
you must be careful and try to approach

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:39.650 
you must be careful and try to approach
at<00:04:37.170> a<00:04:37.200> low<00:04:37.500> speed<00:04:37.550> editor<00:04:38.550> reasonable<00:04:39.150> rate<00:04:39.450> of

at a low speed editor reasonable rate of

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:42.140 
at a low speed editor reasonable rate of
visit<00:04:40.050> i'd<00:04:40.470> say<00:04:40.770> about<00:04:40.860> 200<00:04:41.550> feet<00:04:41.580> per<00:04:42.000> minute

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:42.150 
visit i'd say about 200 feet per minute

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:45.920 
visit i'd say about 200 feet per minute
minus<00:04:42.630> 200<00:04:43.080> feet<00:04:43.290> per<00:04:43.530> minute<00:04:43.680> and<00:04:44.400> then<00:04:44.930> shyam

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:45.930 
minus 200 feet per minute and then shyam

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:48.740 
minus 200 feet per minute and then shyam
and<00:04:46.200> i<00:04:46.590> recommend<00:04:47.190> that<00:04:47.490> you<00:04:47.850> shut<00:04:48.510> off<00:04:48.540> the

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:48.750 
and i recommend that you shut off the

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:50.750 
and i recommend that you shut off the
engines<00:04:49.320> when<00:04:49.590> you're<00:04:49.770> just<00:04:50.040> when<00:04:50.310> you<00:04:50.430> just<00:04:50.610> a

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:50.760 
engines when you're just when you just a

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:52.580 
engines when you're just when you just a
few<00:04:50.940> feet<00:04:50.970> above<00:04:51.330> the<00:04:51.510> runway<00:04:51.720> although<00:04:52.500> i'm

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:52.590 
few feet above the runway although i'm

00:04:52.590 --> 00:05:11.719 
few feet above the runway although i'm
not<00:04:52.650> going<00:04:53.040> to<00:04:53.160> do<00:04:53.280> it<00:04:53.400> this<00:04:53.430> time

00:05:11.719 --> 00:05:11.729 

00:05:11.729 --> 00:05:14.580 

you<00:05:12.729> can<00:05:12.970> nearly<00:05:13.210> see<00:05:13.540> how<00:05:13.720> I<00:05:13.750> am<00:05:14.080> fiddling

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:14.590 
you can nearly see how I am fiddling

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:15.990 
you can nearly see how I am fiddling
about<00:05:14.710> with<00:05:14.860> the<00:05:15.160> throttle<00:05:15.340> trying<00:05:15.880> to

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:16.000 
about with the throttle trying to

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.260 
about with the throttle trying to
maintain<00:05:16.180> as<00:05:16.750> a<00:05:17.620> specific<00:05:18.430> reason<00:05:18.580> about<00:05:19.030> rate

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:19.270 
maintain as a specific reason about rate

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:21.659

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:23.680 
the runway if you go off the runway that

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:25.680 
the runway if you go off the runway that
might<00:05:24.130> be<00:05:24.310> the<00:05:24.340> worst<00:05:24.580> thing<00:05:24.820> that<00:05:25.479> can<00:05:25.630> happen

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:25.690 
might be the worst thing that can happen

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:48.510 
might be the worst thing that can happen
to<00:05:26.050> you

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:48.520 

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:50.909 

here<00:05:49.509> it<00:05:49.720> doesn't<00:05:49.930> matter<00:05:50.259> if<00:05:50.500> you<00:05:50.680> are<00:05:50.740> making

here it doesn't matter if you are making

during<00:06:12.289> the<00:06:12.410> tutorials<00:06:12.979> I<00:06:13.190> keep<00:06:13.400> the<00:06:13.580> crush

00:06:13.779 --> 00:06:13.789 
during the tutorials I keep the crush

00:06:13.789 --> 00:06:16.360 
during the tutorials I keep the crush
setting<00:06:14.240> so<00:06:14.539> so<00:06:14.840> that's<00:06:15.110> right<00:06:15.410> it<00:06:15.919> doesn't
