00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:15.089
 I'll tell him about the trends of the 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.949
 winter 2015 runs 100 of these were 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:19.199
 presented here in the fashion weeks of the 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:21.600

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:23.189
 there in November 2014 there you me 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.650
 Alex asked because you made a 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:30.480
 2015 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:32.210
 in the summer of 2014 following the 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.380
 brands she always said lam with 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:35.910

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.370
 that your bets 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:41.100
 and in the middle of those bets I separated there 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.379
 four trends in which I found I found 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.850
 it is not because the work also of 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.920
 researcher then I have 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.120
 a notion so zinho of what you will get and 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.320
 What are you going to get? 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.719
 then according to the parades I 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.520
 I accompanied my brother and how 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:56.460
 people arrived here in winter 2015 and 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:58.579
 show you how you're going to use it 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.230
 currently since we are in winter 

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:03.930
 2015 if you want to follow this

 I'll let youtube connected to

 you check what it was and there 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.979
 summarize remembering also that all 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.720
 video I do here I do one 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:18.270
 matter complements there on our site 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.860
 so if you want more information from 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.270
 trends in how to use and more 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.670
 looks inspirations 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.439
 just go through the dotcom censorship mode 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.250
 I already said too much now let's go with the 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.689
 Tendencies 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.450
 one of the first trends here I 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:32.280
 I showed in the summaries that I did because I 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.770
 I did so much for the international fashion and 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:37.710
 national level was of the said round 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:40.049
 fashion says she comes is very strong in 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.750
 winter 2015 came very strong from winter 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:45.299
 2015 then a positive point for our 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:48.990
 result that we can see that the 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:49.590
 piece says came in a jacket the pants 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.560
 jeans 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:55.979
 she came up with as the most formal item 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:58.380
 because she comes with an up and blazers 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:01.049
 eternal they were proposed 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:03.750
 Of course it was not taken to the world. 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:05.939
 the way it has appeared is in the 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.570
 walkways because on the catwalk there is a 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:09.240
 overkill 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:13.020
 So you can even go and rescue your 

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:16.560
 summer 2015 jeans summer 2015 shirt 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:19.140
 who is the champion in 2014 and 2015 and use it there 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:21.900
 in winter 2015 is together with a 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:25.230
 overlap along with the jacket itself 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:28.140
 jeans and you can also dare is there 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:30.480
 making customizations like I said in the 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:31.620
 last video then fashion says it's super 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:33.990
 on the rise for men 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:36.959
 currently another strong point that I 

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:39.090
 is spoken in our summary was tailoring 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:41.160
 young tailoring for those who do not know 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:43.410
 those formal pieces are the tests are 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:46.170
 made by tailors understood that she 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:48.270
 there depends a classic modeling 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:51.120
 she has already lost this classic modeling and 

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:53.130
 ended up getting a stop that leaves the 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:56.820
 most comfortable man ended up getting 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:03:00.090
 and appeared on the catwalks as prints 

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:03.540
 more daring and has now appeared 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:06.330
 there with classic prints but with touches 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:09.030
 there because tailoring is now 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:10.980
 modern, she has shoulders 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:13.470
 structured but requires no jamb 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:15.390
 and other points so if you enjoy using 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:18.450
 the battalion is an executive is me 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:21.209
 watching can invest in the suit or the 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:23.310
 stamped face that is super high 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:24.810
 Of course if you 're okay for the 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:27.090
 work environment you will opt for 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:29.340
 something as subtle as it is 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:32.239
 showing in the inspirations that I 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:35.549
 I spoke to you, it 's something else you have. 

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:37.290
 appeared there in winter 2015 there 

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:39.269
 in our summary and I'll be here to 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:41.579
 you is to show how to use are the 

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:45.720
 style mixes the formal comes with 

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:48.269
 casual and and does not have not much 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:51.390
 It's a secret to pass on to you because 

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:54.239
 so it is the Brazilian who opts for 

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:57.329
 comfort man if he chooses to 

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:59.280
 comfort then is the marks are 

00:03:57.329 --> 00:04:02.010
 mixing not only in production 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:03.900
 total but also the formal parts with the 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:06.510
 casual even with the sport so much that the 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:09.480
 people can see there already 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:12.000
 stores zippered blazer is a pair of 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:14.519
 tailoring with sporty touches to 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.910
 it 's the formal one but do not let the 

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:19.360
 on the side because we go Brazil 

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:21.860
 I left we love to be well dressed more 

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:24.290
 comfortable another mix that made 

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:26.780
 success in winter 2014 and returned to the 

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:29.240
 winter 2015 is the mixture of 

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:31.520
 different materials in the same party 

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:33.290
 that you can see there you guys 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:33.980
 accompany the clothes in the cursino 

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:36.050
 Instagram 

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:37.940
 You could see that I received a 

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:40.970
 blazer he has a body 

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:43.700
 the shape of sweatpants and the coconut arms 

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:46.220
 So it's super high in this mix of 

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:49.370
 styles and mix of textures and fabrics 

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:51.860
 and materials in one piece is very easy 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:53.840
 to use has not even if you have 

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:55.760
 any doubt you can use here 

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:57.920
 comments to send because I go 

00:04:55.760 --> 00:05:00.230
 answer you in video form or even 

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:02.840
 in the comments out there a simple tip 

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:04.850
 to respond to the trend that has come 

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:07.790
 that we emphasized the 

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:11.090
 our 2014 story was as follows 

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:14.090
 more spare parts spare parts is the most 

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:17.060
 pants jackets of other items had 

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:18.860
 the more loose the more lakes it is 

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:20.870
 that I want to say we were looser 

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:23.600
 because it has a certain proportion 

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:26.540
 come with your shoulder in the right place with 

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:29.840
 here at the border of the arm and 

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:31.850
 shoulder but it is much looser in the body 

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:33.560
 so it's a great choice for you that is 

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:35.270
 A flu is to give a full bodied you want 

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:38.360
 continue to hide a little of the 

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:41.390
 your fats but do not want to use a 

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:43.400
 clothes that make you even bigger then the 

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:46.580
 parts are looser but will not let 

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:49.250
 to shape the male body but not 

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:51.950
 emphasizes both the real form of who is 

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:53.450
 using the loosest parts then it was 

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:54.169
 one of the latest trends that people 

00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:56.150
 pointed out 

00:05:54.169 --> 00:05:57.890
 but of course there are other trends 

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:59.930
 we are emphasizing there our 

00:05:57.890 --> 00:06:00.470
 matters and we'll talk in the next 

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:02.030
 videos 

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:04.460
 then these are the main trends 

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:06.290
