00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:34.990 
go for the lumber mill and if you're in
the<00:01:33.470> Horde<00:01:33.650> you<00:01:33.710> go<00:01:33.830> for<00:01:34.040> the<00:01:34.100> gold<00:01:34.280> mine<00:01:34.460> or

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:35.000 
the Horde you go for the gold mine or

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.220 
the Horde you go for the gold mine or
you<00:01:35.120> can<00:01:35.240> go<00:01:35.330> the<00:01:35.420> lumber<00:01:35.630> mill<00:01:35.810> too<00:01:35.960> i<00:01:35.990> mean

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:36.230 
you can go the lumber mill too i mean

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:37.180 
you can go the lumber mill too i mean
actually<00:01:36.380> there<00:01:36.650> are<00:01:36.710> two<00:01:36.800> different<00:01:37.070> ways

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:37.190 
actually there are two different ways

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:39.820 
actually there are two different ways
you<00:01:37.280> can<00:01:37.340> handle<00:01:37.610> that<00:01:37.670> the<00:01:38.620> time<00:01:39.620> but<00:01:39.710> i'm

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:39.830 
you can handle that the time but i'm

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:41.470 
you can handle that the time but i'm
losing<00:01:39.980> that<00:01:40.220> one<00:01:40.340> too<00:01:40.490> so<00:01:40.760> then<00:01:41.030> you<00:01:41.300> go<00:01:41.420> to

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:41.480 
losing that one too so then you go to

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:44.860 
losing that one too so then you go to
your<00:01:41.930> third<00:01:42.230> target<00:01:42.500> which<00:01:42.830> is<00:01:43.160> the<00:01:43.700> farm<00:01:43.970> or

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:29.959 
channel that's the idea here is to go

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:31.899 
channel that's the idea here is to go
ahead<00:02:30.109> and<00:02:30.349> try<00:02:30.739> and<00:02:30.920> capture<00:02:31.129> the<00:02:31.400> flag<00:02:31.670> as

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:49.330 
going I stress this a lot in the article
but<00:02:47.810> that<00:02:48.079> we<00:02:48.379> want<00:02:48.590> to<00:02:48.620> make<00:02:48.769> sure<00:02:48.799> that<00:02:48.950> you

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:49.340 
but that we want to make sure that you

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:51.910 
but that we want to make sure that you
get<00:02:50.000> too<00:02:50.239> familiar<00:02:50.840> with<00:02:51.200> the<00:02:51.470> battleground

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:51.920 
get too familiar with the battleground

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:53.680 
get too familiar with the battleground
before<00:02:52.370> you<00:02:52.519> actually<00:02:53.030> have<00:02:53.389> to<00:02:53.510> run<00:02:53.629> it

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:53.690 
before you actually have to run it

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:54.970 
before you actually have to run it
because<00:02:53.959> you<00:02:54.349> need<00:02:54.530> to<00:02:54.620> know<00:02:54.739> where<00:02:54.859> you're

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:54.980 
because you need to know where you're

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:56.800 
because you need to know where you're
going<00:02:55.310> and<00:02:55.340> make<00:02:55.909> decisions<00:02:56.420> like<00:02:56.510> we<00:02:56.720> were

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:56.810 
going and make decisions like we were

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:58.479 
going and make decisions like we were
making<00:02:57.139> earlier<00:02:57.230> where<00:02:57.709> you<00:02:58.099> knew<00:02:58.220> you<00:02:58.340> aren't

00:02:58.479 --> 00:02:58.489 
making earlier where you knew you aren't

00:02:58.489 --> 00:02:59.679 
making earlier where you knew you aren't
going<00:02:58.579> to<00:02:58.639> get<00:02:58.730> those<00:02:58.879> stables<00:02:59.299> you<00:02:59.480> knew<00:02:59.599> you

00:02:59.679 --> 00:02:59.689 
going to get those stables you knew you

00:02:59.689 --> 00:03:00.789 
going to get those stables you knew you
weren't<00:02:59.810> going<00:02:59.959> to<00:03:00.049> get<00:03:00.109> to<00:03:00.230> the<00:03:00.319> lumber<00:03:00.650> mill

00:03:00.789 --> 00:03:00.799 
weren't going to get to the lumber mill

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:02.740 
weren't going to get to the lumber mill
okay<00:03:01.280> so<00:03:01.579> go<00:03:01.730> for<00:03:01.909> the<00:03:01.939> farm<00:03:02.180> if<00:03:02.359> you<00:03:02.540> don't<00:03:02.689> get

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:02.750 
okay so go for the farm if you don't get

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:04.179 
okay so go for the farm if you don't get
the<00:03:02.870> farm<00:03:03.079> we'll<00:03:03.470> just<00:03:03.590> stay<00:03:03.739> in<00:03:03.799> the<00:03:03.889> battle

00:03:04.179 --> 00:03:04.189 
the farm we'll just stay in the battle

00:03:04.189 --> 00:03:05.530 
the farm we'll just stay in the battle
there's<00:03:04.459> every<00:03:04.939> likelihood<00:03:04.970> that<00:03:05.359> you'll

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:05.540 
there's every likelihood that you'll

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:08.020 
there's every likelihood that you'll
still<00:03:05.750> be<00:03:05.900> able<00:03:05.959> to<00:03:06.139> capture<00:03:06.349> flag<00:03:06.739> so<00:03:07.489> here<00:03:07.939> we

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:08.030
