here is some retroactivity going back in
technology<00:00:52.620> Moondancer<00:00:53.430> it's<00:00:53.699> pretty<00:00:54.120> much

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
technology Moondancer it's pretty much

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.680 
technology Moondancer it's pretty much
just<00:00:54.449> a<00:00:54.809> recolored<00:00:55.440> Twilight<00:00:56.039> Sparkle<00:00:56.610> I<00:00:56.820> mean

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
just a recolored Twilight Sparkle I mean

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.200 
just a recolored Twilight Sparkle I mean
that's<00:00:57.780> pretty<00:00:58.590> apparent<00:00:59.129> but<00:00:59.850> they<00:01:00.030> don't

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
that's pretty apparent but they don't

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.959 
that's pretty apparent but they don't
even<00:01:00.480> acknowledge<00:01:00.600> that<00:01:01.350> which<00:01:02.010> is<00:01:02.190> fine<00:01:02.430> it's

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
even acknowledge that which is fine it's

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:06.200 
even acknowledge that which is fine it's
kind<00:01:03.210> of<00:01:03.329> there<00:01:03.539> we<00:01:03.840> realize<00:01:04.290> it<00:01:04.670> but<00:01:05.670> it's<00:01:06.000> not

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
kind of there we realize it but it's not

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.740 
kind of there we realize it but it's not
really<00:01:07.760> mentioned<00:01:08.760> and<00:01:08.880> I<00:01:08.970> guess<00:01:09.210> if<00:01:09.450> it<00:01:09.600> was

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
really mentioned and I guess if it was

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.600 
really mentioned and I guess if it was
mentioned<00:01:10.200> in<00:01:10.290> be<00:01:10.560> awkward<00:01:11.010> but<00:01:11.189> even<00:01:11.490> if

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
mentioned in be awkward but even if

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.410 
mentioned in be awkward but even if
Colgate<00:01:12.540> and<00:01:12.780> her<00:01:13.049> manic<00:01:13.500> state<00:01:14.010> of

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:14.420 
Colgate and her manic state of

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:17.539 
Colgate and her manic state of
excitement<00:01:15.420> could<00:01:16.049> to<00:01:16.830> say<00:01:17.009> a<00:01:17.220> something

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
excitement could to say a something

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:20.240 
excitement could to say a something
funny<00:01:17.790> how<00:01:17.909> you<00:01:17.970> guys<00:01:18.150> look<00:01:18.810> so<00:01:19.020> like<00:01:19.290> you<00:01:20.189> know

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
funny how you guys look so like you know

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.100 
funny how you guys look so like you know
that<00:01:20.729> would<00:01:20.850> make<00:01:21.030> sense<00:01:21.060> but<00:01:21.540> I<00:01:21.600> think<00:01:21.869> it<00:01:21.990> was

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
that would make sense but I think it was

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.109 
that would make sense but I think it was
because<00:01:22.259> back<00:01:22.799> in<00:01:22.830> the<00:01:22.979> day<00:01:23.070> they<00:01:23.460> didn't<00:01:23.759> have

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
because back in the day they didn't have

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:27.620 
because back in the day they didn't have
too<00:01:24.960> many<00:01:25.170> unique<00:01:25.590> puppet<00:01:26.130> rigs<00:01:26.310> a<00:01:26.909> lot<00:01:27.390> of<00:01:27.509> it

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
too many unique puppet rigs a lot of it

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.580 
too many unique puppet rigs a lot of it
oranges<00:01:29.210> palette<00:01:30.210> swamped<00:01:30.659> characters<00:01:31.320> and

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
oranges palette swamped characters and

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.890 
oranges palette swamped characters and
that's<00:01:32.250> easy<00:01:32.520> for<00:01:32.759> animation<00:01:33.299> means<00:01:33.810> they

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
that's easy for animation means they

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.390 
that's easy for animation means they
don't<00:01:33.990> have<00:01:34.170> to<00:01:34.350> even<00:01:34.500> swamp<00:01:34.920> out<00:01:35.130> with<00:01:35.280> the

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
don't have to even swamp out with the

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.640 
don't have to even swamp out with the
hair<00:01:35.610> symbols<00:01:36.240> and<00:01:36.420> stuff<00:01:36.570> like<00:01:36.750> that<00:01:36.810> but<00:01:37.470> it

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
hair symbols and stuff like that but it

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.410 
hair symbols and stuff like that but it
is<00:01:37.799> I<00:01:37.950> was<00:01:38.070> actually<00:01:38.280> really<00:01:38.759> impressed<00:01:38.880> that

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
is I was actually really impressed that

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.300 
is I was actually really impressed that
they<00:01:39.509> didn't<00:01:39.840> have<00:01:40.170> her<00:01:40.380> immediately<00:01:40.920> count

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
they didn't have her immediately count

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.719 
they didn't have her immediately count

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:45.690 
the beginning but now that they're as
big<00:03:44.080> as<00:03:44.230> they<00:03:44.350> are<00:03:44.530> I<00:03:44.560> guess<00:03:44.740> it<00:03:45.040> decided<00:03:45.490> to<00:03:45.520> go

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:45.700 
big as they are I guess it decided to go

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:49.500 
big as they are I guess it decided to go
back<00:03:45.730> and<00:03:46.150> tie<00:03:46.540> up<00:03:46.750> some<00:03:46.780> loose<00:03:47.050> ends<00:03:48.300> which<00:03:49.300> I

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:49.510 
back and tie up some loose ends which I

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:51.110 
back and tie up some loose ends which I
think<00:03:49.780> it<00:03:49.870> was<00:03:49.990> cool<00:03:50.140> that<00:03:50.200> they<00:03:50.440> did<00:03:50.620> and

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120 
think it was cool that they did and

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:54.180 
think it was cool that they did and
don't<00:03:52.120> take<00:03:52.450> me<00:03:52.690> saying<00:03:52.959> that<00:03:53.190> Twilight's

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:54.190 
don't take me saying that Twilight's

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:56.699 
don't take me saying that Twilight's
reasoning<00:03:55.180> for<00:03:55.360> going<00:03:55.660> back<00:03:55.870> is<00:03:56.200> disingenuous

00:03:56.699 --> 00:03:56.709 
reasoning for going back is disingenuous

00:03:56.709 --> 00:04:00.060 
reasoning for going back is disingenuous
as<00:03:57.370> being<00:03:58.090> a<00:03:58.209> fault<00:03:58.600> that's<00:03:59.170> probably<00:03:59.560> how<00:04:00.040> she

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:00.070 
as being a fault that's probably how she

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:05.880 
as being a fault that's probably how she
would<00:04:00.780> realistically<00:04:01.780> acted<00:04:02.620> if<00:04:04.470> if<00:04:05.470> she<00:04:05.709> was

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:05.890 
would realistically acted if if she was

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:08.580 
would realistically acted if if she was
you<00:04:06.250> know<00:04:06.280> real<00:04:06.910> person<00:04:07.450> that's<00:04:08.020> probably<00:04:08.410> how

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:08.590 
you know real person that's probably how

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:10.590 
you know real person that's probably how
him<00:04:08.739> to<00:04:08.860> be<00:04:09.040> be<00:04:09.340> more<00:04:09.520> for<00:04:09.820> herself<00:04:10.180> rather

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:10.600 
him to be be more for herself rather

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:14.140 
him to be be more for herself rather
than<00:04:10.870> her<00:04:11.140> friends<00:04:11.880> quote<00:04:12.880> unquote

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:14.150 
than her friends quote unquote

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:17.600 
than her friends quote unquote
so<00:04:15.150> this<00:04:15.540> episode<00:04:16.020> was<00:04:16.470> in<00:04:16.680> like<00:04:16.830> a<00:04:16.860> main<00:04:17.250> plot

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:17.610 
so this episode was in like a main plot

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:20.240 
so this episode was in like a main plot
development<00:04:18.480> point<00:04:18.660> but<00:04:19.380> it<00:04:19.530> was<00:04:19.800> a<00:04:20.100> good

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:20.250 
development point but it was a good

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:24.800 
development point but it was a good
episode<00:04:21.800> at<00:04:22.800> the<00:04:22.950> very<00:04:23.160> least<00:04:23.280> it's<00:04:23.700> ten<00:04:24.600> times

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:24.810 
episode at the very least it's ten times

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:26.690 
episode at the very least it's ten times
better<00:04:25.200> than<00:04:25.350> princess<00:04:25.920> spike<00:04:26.190> that's<00:04:26.490> for
