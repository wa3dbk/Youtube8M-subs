because<00:01:09.659> they're<00:01:09.960> trying<00:01:10.229> to<00:01:10.290> find<00:01:10.500> a<00:01:10.619> ride<00:01:10.799> so

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
because they're trying to find a ride so

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.179 
because they're trying to find a ride so
that<00:01:11.280> they<00:01:11.400> can<00:01:11.640> drive<00:01:12.000> it<00:01:12.150> off<00:01:12.330> home<00:01:13.080> and<00:01:13.439> take

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189
