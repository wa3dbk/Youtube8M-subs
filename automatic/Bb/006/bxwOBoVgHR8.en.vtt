00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:55.720 
as it would be because it's difficult

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:13.600 
before but i thought this kid's got the

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:15.150 
before but i thought this kid's got the
potential<00:04:13.900> it's<00:04:14.230> a<00:04:14.320> nice<00:04:14.530> black<00:04:14.890> yet<00:04:15.130> i
