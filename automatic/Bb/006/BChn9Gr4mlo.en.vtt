for two reasons

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.559 
for two reasons
well<00:02:07.590> maybe<00:02:07.740> three<00:02:08.209> there's<00:02:09.209> a<00:02:09.270> phrase<00:02:09.539> in

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
well maybe three there's a phrase in

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:11.960 
well maybe three there's a phrase in
Wall<00:02:09.899> Street<00:02:09.929> sir<00:02:10.440> David<00:02:10.739> that<00:02:10.860> says<00:02:11.099> markets

Wall Street sir David that says markets

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.670 
Wall Street sir David that says markets
will<00:02:12.209> take<00:02:12.420> the<00:02:12.540> staircase<00:02:12.810> up

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
will take the staircase up

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.920 
will take the staircase up
like<00:02:14.099> the<00:02:14.220> right<00:02:14.340> to<00:02:14.489> elevator<00:02:14.940> down<00:02:15.450> it<00:02:15.780> just

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
like the right to elevator down it just

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.259 
like the right to elevator down it just
means<00:02:16.049> markets<00:02:16.620> will<00:02:16.739> go<00:02:16.860> faster<00:02:17.430> on<00:02:17.640> the<00:02:18.150> way

00:02:18.259 --> 00:02:18.269 
means markets will go faster on the way

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:21.229 
means markets will go faster on the way
down<00:02:18.480> and<00:02:18.750> the<00:02:19.530> way<00:02:19.560> I<00:02:20.010> see<00:02:20.370> it<00:02:20.400> is<00:02:20.549> you<00:02:20.819> know

00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:21.239 
down and the way I see it is you know

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:22.759 
down and the way I see it is you know
then<00:02:21.659> you<00:02:21.870> can<00:02:22.019> make<00:02:22.140> money<00:02:22.349> in<00:02:22.440> any<00:02:22.560> direction

then you can make money in any direction

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:24.770 
then you can make money in any direction
and<00:02:23.459> now<00:02:23.549> many<00:02:23.760> people<00:02:23.849> know<00:02:24.090> that<00:02:24.269> you<00:02:24.629> can

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
and now many people know that you can

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:26.059 
and now many people know that you can
make<00:02:24.900> money<00:02:25.080> when<00:02:25.260> markets<00:02:25.530> go<00:02:25.620> up<00:02:25.650> you<00:02:25.950> can

00:02:26.059 --> 00:02:26.069 
make money when markets go up you can

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:29.330 
make money when markets go up you can
make<00:02:26.190> money<00:02:26.310> markets<00:02:26.790> go<00:02:26.879> down<00:02:27.060> okay<00:02:28.069> so<00:02:29.069> if

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
make money markets go down okay so if

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.160 
make money markets go down okay so if
you<00:02:29.430> know<00:02:29.549> how<00:02:29.640> to<00:02:29.670> make<00:02:29.849> money<00:02:30.060> downwards<00:02:30.720> and

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
you know how to make money downwards and

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.319 
you know how to make money downwards and
because<00:02:31.890> you<00:02:31.980> can<00:02:32.129> make<00:02:32.220> money<00:02:32.430> faster<00:02:32.970> it's

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:33.329 
because you can make money faster it's

00:02:33.329 --> 00:02:35.899 
because you can make money faster it's
very<00:02:33.930> attractive<00:02:34.129> the<00:02:35.129> other<00:02:35.280> reason<00:02:35.670> why

00:02:35.899 --> 00:02:35.909 
very attractive the other reason why

00:02:35.909 --> 00:02:39.500 
very attractive the other reason why
that's<00:02:36.060> attractive<00:02:36.599> is<00:02:36.690> because<00:02:37.280> an<00:02:38.510> unstable

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
that's attractive is because an unstable

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:42.100 
that's attractive is because an unstable
economy<00:02:39.870> in<00:02:40.319> a<00:02:40.409> recession<00:02:40.920> creates<00:02:41.340> trends

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:42.110 
economy in a recession creates trends

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:45.020 
economy in a recession creates trends
what<00:02:43.110> creates<00:02:43.409> volatility<00:02:43.950> and<00:02:44.159> that<00:02:44.700> creates

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
what creates volatility and that creates

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:47.119 
what creates volatility and that creates
trending<00:02:45.690> market<00:02:46.019> which<00:02:46.290> means<00:02:46.500> markets<00:02:46.980> will

00:02:47.119 --> 00:02:47.129 
trending market which means markets will

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:49.819 
trending market which means markets will
move<00:02:47.280> decisively<00:02:47.670> in<00:02:48.269> one<00:02:49.140> direction<00:02:49.319> and

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:49.829 
move decisively in one direction and

00:02:49.829 --> 00:02:52.699 
move decisively in one direction and
again<00:02:50.160> that's<00:02:50.310> very<00:02:50.519> attractive<00:02:50.609> to<00:02:51.709> traders

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:52.709 
again that's very attractive to traders

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:54.830 
again that's very attractive to traders
who<00:02:53.010> want<00:02:53.160> to<00:02:53.250> trade<00:02:53.430> up<00:02:53.549> I<00:02:54.180> think<00:02:54.540> probably

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
who want to trade up I think probably

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.559 
who want to trade up I think probably
the<00:02:55.019> most<00:02:55.170> important<00:02:55.709> reason<00:02:56.040> why<00:02:57.030> recession

00:02:57.559 --> 00:02:57.569 
the most important reason why recession

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:00.920 
the most important reason why recession
is<00:02:57.629> a<00:02:57.690> good<00:02:57.840> thing<00:02:57.989> is<00:02:58.980> because<00:02:59.340> it<00:02:59.579> it<00:03:00.569> makes

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
is a good thing is because it it makes

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:02.869 
is a good thing is because it it makes
the<00:03:01.349> prices<00:03:01.620> of<00:03:01.799> a<00:03:01.859> lot<00:03:01.980> of<00:03:02.069> assets<00:03:02.459> cheaper

00:03:02.869 --> 00:03:02.879 
the prices of a lot of assets cheaper

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:05.539 
the prices of a lot of assets cheaper
for<00:03:03.870> people<00:03:03.900> to<00:03:04.140> buy<00:03:04.290> so<00:03:04.680> but<00:03:05.040> when<00:03:05.220> you<00:03:05.340> assign

00:03:05.539 --> 00:03:05.549 
for people to buy so but when you assign

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:07.399 
for people to buy so but when you assign
something<00:03:05.849> like<00:03:06.120> the<00:03:06.569> trader<00:03:06.870> thing<00:03:07.170> for

00:03:07.399 --> 00:03:07.409 
something like the trader thing for

00:03:07.409 --> 00:03:09.559 
something like the trader thing for
instance<00:03:07.709> right<00:03:08.040> and<00:03:08.280> the<00:03:08.940> point<00:03:09.180> is<00:03:09.359> that

00:03:09.559 --> 00:03:09.569 
instance right and the point is that

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:11.839 
instance right and the point is that
what<00:03:10.560> you're<00:03:10.739> saying<00:03:11.010> there<00:03:11.220> is<00:03:11.370> that<00:03:11.400> traders

00:03:11.839 --> 00:03:11.849 
what you're saying there is that traders

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:14.360 
what you're saying there is that traders
can<00:03:12.150> do<00:03:12.359> well<00:03:12.599> with<00:03:12.920> things<00:03:13.920> going<00:03:14.220> down

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
can do well with things going down

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:17.000 
can do well with things going down
saying<00:03:14.760> can<00:03:15.659> average<00:03:16.079> people<00:03:16.379> yes<00:03:16.799> they<00:03:16.950> can

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
saying can average people yes they can

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:18.680 
saying can average people yes they can
do<00:03:17.220> they<00:03:17.340> have<00:03:17.579> the<00:03:17.730> ability<00:03:18.150> to<00:03:18.180> do<00:03:18.419> so

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690 
do they have the ability to do so

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:22.250 
do they have the ability to do so
absolutely<00:03:19.440> tax<00:03:19.739> the<00:03:20.359> numbers<00:03:21.359> whatever<00:03:21.810> this

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.260 
absolutely tax the numbers whatever this

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:23.830 
absolutely tax the numbers whatever this
is<00:03:22.319> the<00:03:22.470> thing<00:03:22.680> it's<00:03:23.280> not<00:03:23.459> rocket<00:03:23.669> science

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:23.840 
is the thing it's not rocket science

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:26.210 
is the thing it's not rocket science
making<00:03:24.840> money<00:03:25.079> downwards<00:03:25.590> is<00:03:25.709> not<00:03:25.919> rocket

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.220 
making money downwards is not rocket

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:28.789 
making money downwards is not rocket
science<00:03:26.489> oh<00:03:27.000> it's<00:03:27.180> difficult<00:03:27.959> it's<00:03:28.079> hard<00:03:28.109> it

00:03:28.789 --> 00:03:28.799 
science oh it's difficult it's hard it

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:30.259 
science oh it's difficult it's hard it
can<00:03:28.980> be<00:03:29.129> risky<00:03:29.430> if<00:03:29.489> you<00:03:29.579> don't<00:03:29.730> know<00:03:29.790> I'm<00:03:30.180> not

00:03:30.259 --> 00:03:30.269 
can be risky if you don't know I'm not

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:31.460 
can be risky if you don't know I'm not
saying<00:03:30.419> people<00:03:30.629> should<00:03:30.870> gamble

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470

in this problem and it's gonna be risky

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:30.890 
in this problem and it's gonna be risky
if<00:04:29.009> you<00:04:29.099> wait<00:04:29.340> and<00:04:29.520> you<00:04:29.610> wait<00:04:29.759> it's<00:04:30.599> gonna<00:04:30.750> be

too risky and if the trade is training

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:37.070 
too risky and if the trade is training
in<00:04:34.289> order<00:04:34.470> to<00:04:34.620> come<00:04:35.580> out<00:04:35.759> come<00:04:36.599> out<00:04:36.750> when<00:04:36.930> the

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:37.080 
in order to come out come out when the

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:38.420 
in order to come out come out when the
thing<00:04:37.229> that's<00:04:37.379> gone<00:04:37.530> down<00:04:37.590> the<00:04:37.979> markets<00:04:38.310> come

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:38.430 
thing that's gone down the markets come

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:38.779 
thing that's gone down the markets come
down

00:04:38.779 --> 00:04:38.789 
down

00:04:38.789 --> 00:04:40.339 
down
they're<00:04:39.060> very<00:04:39.240> action<00:04:39.750> if<00:04:39.870> they're<00:04:40.169> doing

00:04:40.339 --> 00:04:40.349 
they're very action if they're doing

00:04:40.349 --> 00:04:42.110 
they're very action if they're doing
shorten<00:04:40.770> things<00:04:40.949> or<00:04:41.190> whatever<00:04:41.340> would

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:42.120 
shorten things or whatever would

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:45.770 
shorten things or whatever would
increase<00:04:42.599> the<00:04:43.050> down<00:04:43.259> the<00:04:43.770> downhill<00:04:44.780> ride

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:45.780 
increase the down the downhill ride

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:50.080 
increase the down the downhill ride
maybe<00:04:46.699> absolutely<00:04:47.699> so<00:04:47.849> the<00:04:48.210> point<00:04:48.479> is<00:04:48.659> though

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:50.090 
maybe absolutely so the point is though

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:51.890 
maybe absolutely so the point is though
what<00:04:51.090> I<00:04:51.120> was<00:04:51.300> really<00:04:51.389> trying<00:04:51.509> to<00:04:51.659> get<00:04:51.750> out

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:51.900 
what I was really trying to get out

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:53.930 
what I was really trying to get out
there<00:04:52.080> is<00:04:52.259> if<00:04:52.800> we're<00:04:53.190> gonna<00:04:53.280> have<00:04:53.520> a<00:04:53.550> financial

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:53.940 
there is if we're gonna have a financial

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:56.230 
there is if we're gonna have a financial
crisis<00:04:54.419> and<00:04:54.599> it<00:04:54.720> certainly<00:04:54.930> looks<00:04:55.050> that<00:04:55.379> way

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:56.240 
crisis and it certainly looks that way

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:58.909 
crisis and it certainly looks that way
if<00:04:57.240> the<00:04:57.479> markets<00:04:57.780> are<00:04:57.930> gonna<00:04:58.080> go<00:04:58.259> down<00:04:58.409> this<00:04:58.770> is

00:04:58.909 --> 00:04:58.919 
if the markets are gonna go down this is

00:04:58.919 --> 00:05:01.339 
if the markets are gonna go down this is
not<00:04:59.039> a<00:04:59.069> time<00:04:59.370> right<00:04:59.669> now<00:04:59.819> to<00:04:59.879> sit<00:05:00.240> and<00:05:00.479> wait<00:05:00.750> see

00:05:01.339 --> 00:05:01.349 
not a time right now to sit and wait see

00:05:01.349 --> 00:05:02.809 
not a time right now to sit and wait see
what<00:05:01.379> happens<00:05:01.860> and<00:05:02.069> hope<00:05:02.250> things<00:05:02.490> are<00:05:02.669> going

00:05:02.809 --> 00:05:02.819 
what happens and hope things are going

00:05:02.819 --> 00:05:05.689 
what happens and hope things are going
to<00:05:02.879> get<00:05:02.940> better<00:05:03.150> my<00:05:04.159> ruling<00:05:05.159> principle<00:05:05.610> is

00:05:05.689 --> 00:05:05.699 
to get better my ruling principle is

00:05:05.699 --> 00:05:07.760 
to get better my ruling principle is
always<00:05:05.849> being<00:05:06.270> prepared<00:05:07.139> for<00:05:07.199> the<00:05:07.319> worst<00:05:07.560> but

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:07.770 
always being prepared for the worst but

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:10.310 
always being prepared for the worst but
hope<00:05:07.949> for<00:05:08.099> the<00:05:08.159> best
