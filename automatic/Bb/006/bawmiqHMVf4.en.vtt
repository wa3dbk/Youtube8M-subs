00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
assuming that when you were raided it's

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.289 
assuming that when you were raided it's
they're<00:01:41.280> gonna<00:01:41.400> be<00:01:41.549> seeing<00:01:41.850> the<00:01:41.939> same<00:01:42.060> thing

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
they're gonna be seeing the same thing

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:43.399 
they're gonna be seeing the same thing
they're<00:01:42.479> gonna<00:01:42.600> see<00:01:42.780> the<00:01:42.869> town<00:01:43.020> hall<00:01:43.200> there

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
they're gonna see the town hall there

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.550 
they're gonna see the town hall there
it's<00:01:43.799> not<00:01:43.920> gonna<00:01:44.130> see<00:01:44.460> my<00:01:44.729> outside<00:01:45.149> the<00:01:45.270> map

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:45.560 
it's not gonna see my outside the map

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:47.929 
it's not gonna see my outside the map
but<00:01:46.560> approach<00:01:46.890> to<00:01:47.070> get<00:01:47.189> it<00:01:47.280> back<00:01:47.430> as<00:01:47.670> you<00:01:47.759> just

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
but approach to get it back as you just

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:50.450 
but approach to get it back as you just
tap<00:01:48.090> it<00:01:48.119> move<00:01:49.020> it<00:01:49.170> and<00:01:49.409> then<00:01:50.009> it's<00:01:50.189> just<00:01:50.340> the

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
tap it move it and then it's just the

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.590 
tap it move it and then it's just the
back<00:01:50.610> time<00:01:50.790> normally<00:01:51.450> in<00:01:52.409> school<00:01:52.939> so<00:01:53.939> this

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
back time normally in school so this

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.630 
back time normally in school so this
