quality<00:00:24.210> the<00:00:24.900> quality<00:00:25.080> sucks<00:00:25.470> on<00:00:25.680> my<00:00:25.949> little

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
quality the quality sucks on my little

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:28.640 
quality the quality sucks on my little
camera<00:00:26.630> but<00:00:27.630> then<00:00:27.810> whenever<00:00:27.960> it<00:00:28.230> actually

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
camera but then whenever it actually

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.679 
camera but then whenever it actually
gets<00:00:28.830> to<00:00:28.890> the<00:00:28.980> computer<00:00:29.519> or<00:00:29.640> something<00:00:29.849> it

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
gets to the computer or something it

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.970 
gets to the computer or something it
looks<00:00:30.750> like<00:00:31.140> so<00:00:31.349> much<00:00:31.410> better<00:00:31.710> so<00:00:32.160> you<00:00:33.090> know

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:33.980 
looks like so much better so you know

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:36.650 
looks like so much better so you know
yeah<00:00:34.980> so<00:00:35.340> I<00:00:35.579> guess<00:00:36.090> we'll<00:00:36.270> start<00:00:36.480> with<00:00:36.570> the

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
yeah so I guess we'll start with the

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.619 
yeah so I guess we'll start with the
British<00:00:36.960> side<00:00:37.700> so<00:00:38.700> as<00:00:38.910> you<00:00:39.030> can<00:00:39.120> see<00:00:39.329> there's<00:00:39.540> a

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
British side so as you can see there's a

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.630 
British side so as you can see there's a
little<00:00:39.809> house<00:00:40.079> over<00:00:40.320> here<00:00:40.469> it<00:00:41.100> kind<00:00:41.399> of<00:00:41.489> is

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
little house over here it kind of is

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.160 
little house over here it kind of is
like<00:00:41.670> the<00:00:41.940> start<00:00:42.180> of<00:00:42.300> a<00:00:42.390> little<00:00:42.660> cluster<00:00:42.960> of

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
like the start of a little cluster of

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:44.479 
like the start of a little cluster of
buildings<00:00:43.469> back<00:00:44.010> there

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
buildings back there

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.389 
buildings back there
and<00:00:44.809> there<00:00:45.809> was<00:00:45.989> a<00:00:46.020> British<00:00:46.379> like<00:00:47.039> command

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399

post or something back there and so over
here<00:00:51.030> you<00:00:51.360> have<00:00:51.600> some<00:00:52.379> figures<00:00:52.860> and<00:00:53.420> some<00:00:54.420> gear

00:00:55.029 --> 00:00:55.039 
here you have some figures and some gear

00:00:55.039 --> 00:00:57.680 
here you have some figures and some gear
then<00:00:56.039> you<00:00:56.160> have<00:00:56.340> a<00:00:56.370> another<00:00:57.000> graph<00:00:57.270> over<00:00:57.329> here

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
then you have a another graph over here

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.950 
then you have a another graph over here
with<00:00:58.140> the<00:00:58.800> Brin<00:00:59.100> gun<00:01:00.920> and<00:01:01.920> back<00:01:02.370> here<00:01:02.609> you<00:01:02.699> have

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:02.960

a<00:01:13.700> cool<00:01:14.700> design<00:01:14.850> like<00:01:15.810> that<00:01:15.990> house<00:01:17.479> it's<00:01:18.479> like

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
a cool design like that house it's like

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.090 
a cool design like that house it's like
a<00:01:18.659> little<00:01:18.930> pathway<00:01:19.140> coming<00:01:19.619> out<00:01:19.710> of<00:01:19.830> it<00:01:19.950> too

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
a little pathway coming out of it too

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.190 
a little pathway coming out of it too
which<00:01:20.250> is<00:01:20.400> nice<00:01:20.580> and<00:01:20.850> this<00:01:21.540> actually<00:01:22.020> looks

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
which is nice and this actually looks

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.260 
which is nice and this actually looks
really<00:01:22.290> weird<00:01:22.979> on<00:01:23.130> camera<00:01:23.189> for<00:01:23.790> some<00:01:23.909> reason

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
really weird on camera for some reason

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.800 
really weird on camera for some reason
like<00:01:24.420> the<00:01:24.600> layering<00:01:24.810> and<00:01:25.200> stuff<00:01:26.570> hopefully<00:01:27.570> it

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
like the layering and stuff hopefully it

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.999 
like the layering and stuff hopefully it
looks<00:01:27.960> a<00:01:28.049> little<00:01:28.140> better<00:01:28.380> on<00:01:29.270> the<00:01:30.270> computer

00:01:30.999 --> 00:01:31.009 
looks a little better on the computer

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:34.370 
looks a little better on the computer
may<00:01:32.009> I<00:01:32.040> show<00:01:32.430> you<00:01:32.490> some<00:01:32.820> trees<00:01:33.119> a<00:01:33.390> pretty<00:01:34.229> cool

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
may I show you some trees a pretty cool

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.980 
may I show you some trees a pretty cool
I<00:01:35.280> don't<00:01:35.909> know<00:01:35.970> what<00:01:36.090> that<00:01:36.210> is<00:01:36.360> just<00:01:36.720> a<00:01:36.810> dark

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
I don't know what that is just a dark

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.950 
I don't know what that is just a dark
tan<00:01:37.170> spot<00:01:37.500> I<00:01:37.530> guess<00:01:38.270> then<00:01:39.270> when<00:01:39.479> you<00:01:39.600> go<00:01:39.780> out

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
tan spot I guess then when you go out

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:46.370 
tan spot I guess then when you go out
here<00:01:40.200> to<00:01:40.229> the<00:01:40.409> field<00:01:43.579> you<00:01:44.579> have<00:01:44.899> some<00:01:45.899> Germans

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
here to the field you have some Germans

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.340 
here to the field you have some Germans
they<00:01:46.590> have<00:01:46.799> been<00:01:47.009> ambushed<00:01:47.579> and<00:01:48.030> are<00:01:48.840> taking

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
they have been ambushed and are taking

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:54.370 
they have been ambushed and are taking
heavy<00:01:49.590> fire<00:01:49.939> from<00:01:50.939> the<00:01:51.030> Bren<00:01:51.420> gun<00:01:51.860> so<00:01:52.909> you<00:01:53.909> know

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:54.380 
heavy fire from the Bren gun so you know

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:56.810 
heavy fire from the Bren gun so you know
so<00:01:55.380> this<00:01:55.500> is<00:01:55.710> cool<00:01:55.920> grass<00:01:56.189> field<00:01:56.490> here<00:01:56.700> it's

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
so this is cool grass field here it's

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.170 
so this is cool grass field here it's
like<00:01:56.969> really<00:01:57.869> dense<00:01:58.200> um<00:01:58.979> ran<00:01:59.759> out<00:01:59.880> of<00:02:00.000> grass

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
like really dense um ran out of grass

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.870 
like really dense um ran out of grass
though<00:02:00.420> so<00:02:00.570> I<00:02:00.600> need<00:02:00.780> some<00:02:00.960> more<00:02:01.110> grass<00:02:01.380> I<00:02:01.880> did

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
though so I need some more grass I did

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.340 
though so I need some more grass I did
actually<00:02:03.060> I<00:02:03.270> do<00:02:03.390> just<00:02:03.719> have<00:02:03.840> that<00:02:04.020> much<00:02:04.140> left

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
actually I do just have that much left

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.499 
actually I do just have that much left
and<00:02:04.530> that's<00:02:04.619> just<00:02:04.829> from<00:02:04.979> picking<00:02:05.369> up<00:02:05.640> pieces

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
and that's just from picking up pieces

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:08.169 
and that's just from picking up pieces
where<00:02:06.689> I<00:02:06.719> put<00:02:06.990> the<00:02:07.079> figures<00:02:07.439> down<00:02:07.710> and<00:02:07.890> stuff

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:08.179 
where I put the figures down and stuff

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:10.050 
where I put the figures down and stuff
so

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.060 
so

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:12.900 
so

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:15.900 
there was a figure he's been shot guys
shooting<00:02:13.920> that<00:02:14.920> guy's<00:02:15.190> been<00:02:15.400> hit<00:02:15.550> and<00:02:15.819> that

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:31.530 
like these trees they will be appearing
in<00:02:29.110> some<00:02:29.349> mocks<00:02:29.620> now<00:02:30.040> if<00:02:30.700> I<00:02:30.819> got<00:02:31.000> more<00:02:31.150> parts

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:34.770 
in some mocks now if I got more parts
and<00:02:32.200> bits<00:02:32.470> for<00:02:32.830> them<00:02:32.980> so<00:02:33.640> that<00:02:33.910> is<00:02:34.060> nice<00:02:34.360> I<00:02:34.720> just
