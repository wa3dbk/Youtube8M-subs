00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:19.039
 you fold a pyramid of paper 

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:37.940
 that's easy and simple 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:40.350
 requires a din a4 sheet 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:47.879
 This one folds once in the longitudinal direction 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:54.300
 centered together in about this way now 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:57.000
 the lower part to the middle of the 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:01:00.540
 looks the same we do 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.940
 with the other side as the ends 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:05.220
 then folded are the lower right 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:08.369
 corner folds now exactly to the 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:10.970
 The center line of the fold starts here 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:15.090
 left lower corner so from here so far 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:18.750
 the corner is folded over so that looks 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:21.929
 from now on we think of a line here 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.759
 Now we hold the corner from below 

00:01:21.929 --> 00:01:24.659
 left once at this imaginary line 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:28.710
 up 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:30.960
 it's thinking of the right now knew 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.240
 Here's a new line and fold 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.520
 the triangle back up to the 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.170
 left knew 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:38.939
 and one last time the corner again 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.369
 Tilt up over the edge 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:42.840
 right bar 

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:44.960
 if you have that done you only need 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.390
 turn left corner and turn the corner 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:51.979
 especially in front 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:51.979
 now the whole thing will be noticed again 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:07.680
 so now you take the lower left 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:09.299
 corner and put it up here is that 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:11.400
 paper double laid now you put 

00:02:09.299 --> 00:02:15.660
 the lower left corner in there and ready 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:18.920
 the pyramid is now only 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:18.920
 gently push together 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:35.430
 and done I did not like as accurate 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:36.810
 that is why something is dirty when you 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:42.990
 she also looks right 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:44.700
 beautiful you can decorate the pages 

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:48.030
 or even the vacancies something 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:49.170
 Together with laser and something in the topic 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:51.960
 hide pyramid 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:52.920
 ok have fun when nachzubasteln and thank you 

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:54.720
 for watching 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:57.380
 I'm always happy about a thumb 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:57.380
 thank high
