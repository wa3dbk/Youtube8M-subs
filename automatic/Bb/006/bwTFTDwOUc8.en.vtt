00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:21.680
 all guys are close by and 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:22.039
 welcome back on the canal with a new one 

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:23.689
 video 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:25.520
 today I am here to offer you this new one 

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:27.560
 gameplay here on the channel just yes 

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:29.720
 it's a 40 26 on death match but of 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:31.369
 what we'll talk about later we'll talk later 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:33.949
 also of the fact that exactly how you can 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:36.019
 already note is registered on xbox one 

00:00:33.949 --> 00:00:37.670
 now I'd like to tell you something first though 

00:00:36.019 --> 00:00:39.769
 because maybe like real and I promised 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:41.480
 that Tuesday was very likely there 

00:00:39.769 --> 00:00:43.280
 I would have led to DNA 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:45.350
 this is what I thought of time 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:47.300
 that is, when that time is seven 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:48.680
 days ago, but then I have boys 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:50.869
 rethought for coletto what sense to 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:52.760
 put me in a group of 6 to make a DNA 

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:54.290
 which in any case is the same as the one they do 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:55.790
 all the others when I could try 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:56.989
 do something a little more different for 

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:58.729
 the channel 

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:00.320
 then I decided to do so by 

00:00:58.729 --> 00:01:02.210
 try to bring something different 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:03.739
 which however differs from the usual ones 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:05.239
 gameplay that you see in the domain in 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:07.460
 group of 6 with the egg is always active 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:10.820
 but guys obviously to do a 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:12.110
 more difficult gameplay you need 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:14.060
 just a little more time 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:16.490
 in this case I was just playing 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:18.409
 on team deathmatch and it came out 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:20.509
 like the game because they are 42 anyway 

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:23.149
 kills and six died alone 

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:25.039
 get ready for it at the food trust but ce 

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:26.600
 bring it anyway kids today like 

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:29.060
 main topic I would like to teach you 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:32.119
 how to unlock this secret skin 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:33.729
 this secret point is the zombie skin 

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:36.020
 zombies that however only unlocks 

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:38.960
 doing a secret mission because 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:40.850
 in fact it cannot be seen as a goal 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:43.549
 to unlock when entering inside 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:46.100
 of personalization staff and 

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:47.899
 so I guess it was maybe necessary 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:49.369
 for those who wanted a little video for 

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:51.289
 tell you a little about what there was to be 

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:52.549
 do precisely to unlock it 

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:54.469
 then first let's talk a little bit about 

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:56.030
 match is heated by a 40 26 in tube 

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:58.310
 deathmatch performed from level 2 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:00.049
 in fact when I switched to xbox one 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:01.670
 and later we will also talk about this ho 

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:03.259
 created this new account this new 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:05.509
 however realize that I will not use anymore because 

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:07.819
 but I thought it was my main 

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:09.319
 perhaps it is better to say bo we create c 

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:12.050
 one thing I did this game 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:14.000
 came out of good 40 26 and yes the lobby was 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:14.959
 quite easy indeed very easy 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.209
 there were opponents anyway 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:18.530
 quite scarce he could perhaps try 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:20.870
 to do something more but you know from 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:23.069
 level 2 to level 3 without weapons without 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:25.290
 specialty and without 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:28.139
 precisely accessories is not easy so it goes 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:30.420
 well or try I tried to get by this way 

00:02:28.139 --> 00:02:31.859
 I made this 40 26 in my opinion 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:33.480
 pretty nice because anyway a 

00:02:31.859 --> 00:02:35.370
 Looks for gameplay and nothing I hope 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:37.049
 you can appreciate it as indeed it is 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:38.969
 I appreciate you guys now 

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:40.950
 let's talk a little about this zombie 

00:02:38.969 --> 00:02:43.019
 zombies I would like to thank precisely for 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:44.819
 telling me how to do cp shock that is 

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:47.340
 an enemy who has not even helped 

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:50.519
 to take it that just told me how 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:52.319
 this skin got rid of in my opinion 

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:53.669
 very cool because they all play anyway 

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:55.109
 with the normality men jack with it 

00:02:53.669 --> 00:02:57.180
 zombies from the hunt is absurd 

00:02:55.109 --> 00:02:58.709
 beautiful and so today I am here for 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:59.549
 tell you a little to tell you how 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:02.010
 take it 

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:04.829
 then it is a very simple thing to do 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:07.099
 but perhaps quite what long 

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:10.620
 you have to do is finish all the missions 

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:12.060
 in the former survival mode 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:14.250
 what I mean by this I mean that 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:18.030
 perhaps for those who have already tried with the 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:19.500
 mode there are bands there is the first 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:21.269
 band that there are five maps the 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:23.150
 second other five maps the third 

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:25.199
 five maps and the fourth one is only rio 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:27.780
 precisely the map that this company's 

00:03:25.199 --> 00:03:30.150
 gameplay to unlock the second band 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:32.310
 you have to do 50 rounds in the first for 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:35.430
 unlock the third 75 round in the 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:38.310
 second and to unlock the fourth type 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:39.470
 in the third one, however, I am an oret 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:41.459
 pretty near numbers 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:43.019
 approximate now I don't remember them with 

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:45.479
 accuracy and more or less yes 

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:47.879
 around 200 250 rounds 

00:03:45.479 --> 00:03:48.930
 so yes it's not easy though with a 

00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:50.579
 you can do it for a while 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:54.269
 and the only thing left for us to do is 

00:03:50.579 --> 00:03:56.879
 this point is to play elliot and finish it 

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:58.799
 just arrive at the 11th wave that I am 

00:03:56.879 --> 00:04:01.109
 only 11 which in fact is not infinite 

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:03.090
 he asserted the eleventh round will be filled 

00:04:01.109 --> 00:04:05.819
 all of zombies you can kill them and 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:07.919
 then you can finally escape then 

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:09.689
 yes here this is more or less like 

00:04:07.919 --> 00:04:12.449
 catch it zombie once completed 

00:04:09.689 --> 00:04:15.000
 just the map you will have easy 

00:04:12.449 --> 00:04:17.430
 easy your zombie to use then 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.630
 they hope it was just a 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:20.099
 useful advice because maybe it can be 

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:22.109
 nice to play with a little skill 

00:04:20.099 --> 00:04:23.880
 however different guys I finally wanted 

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:25.530
 talk to you a little about why they passed 

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:27.960
 xbox one as many of you have me 

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:32.080
 did we do the game on ps3 was 

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:33.879
 quite not to say scrauso however 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:35.379
 the very low level compared to that 

00:04:33.879 --> 00:04:37.750
 which however is on next gen 

00:04:35.379 --> 00:04:39.639
 because as I did, I discovered the 

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:41.259
 play was almost alone 

00:04:39.639 --> 00:04:43.000
 developed on next gen 

00:04:41.259 --> 00:04:44.620
 so guys like 200 the terms and 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.599
 I hope that everything was clear is 

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:48.580
 useful if something doesn't come back from you 

00:04:46.599 --> 00:04:49.569
 themes in the comments let me like a 

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:51.819
