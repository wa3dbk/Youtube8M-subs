this way and have just the needles in
because<00:02:47.800> sometimes<00:02:48.010> when<00:02:48.459> you<00:02:48.489> cook<00:02:48.910> this

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840 
because sometimes when you cook this

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.259 
because sometimes when you cook this
stalk<00:02:50.230> actually<00:02:50.860> has<00:02:51.220> tannins<00:02:51.760> it<00:02:51.910> is<00:02:52.060> a

00:02:52.259 --> 00:02:52.269 
stalk actually has tannins it is a

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:54.750 
stalk actually has tannins it is a
bitterness<00:02:52.629> that<00:02:52.810> it<00:02:53.080> imparts<00:02:53.440> so<00:02:54.310> if<00:02:54.519> it's<00:02:54.670> a

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.760 
bitterness that it imparts so if it's a

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:57.960 
bitterness that it imparts so if it's a
tender<00:02:55.620> branch<00:02:56.620> of<00:02:57.010> rosemary<00:02:57.489> use<00:02:57.640> the<00:02:57.790> whole

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:57.970 
tender branch of rosemary use the whole

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:00.780 
tender branch of rosemary use the whole
thing<00:02:58.110> otherwise<00:02:59.110> just<00:02:59.440> pluck<00:03:00.310> it<00:03:00.459> like<00:03:00.640> that

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:00.790 
thing otherwise just pluck it like that

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:04.620 
thing otherwise just pluck it like that
off<00:03:01.739> okay<00:03:02.739> I<00:03:02.769> think<00:03:03.069> we<00:03:03.220> have<00:03:03.340> enough<00:03:03.610> let<00:03:04.510> me

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:04.630 
off okay I think we have enough let me

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:08.490 
off okay I think we have enough let me
toss<00:03:04.870> it<00:03:05.049> all<00:03:05.200> together<00:03:05.349> and<00:03:07.140> you<00:03:08.140> let<00:03:08.349> this

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:08.500 
toss it all together and you let this

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:11.660 
toss it all together and you let this
marinate<00:03:09.099> in<00:03:09.310> the<00:03:09.370> refrigerator<00:03:10.440> for<00:03:11.440> about

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:11.670 
marinate in the refrigerator for about

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:15.900 
marinate in the refrigerator for about
six<00:03:12.670> hours<00:03:12.880> four<00:03:13.360> hours<00:03:13.390> even<00:03:14.079> overnight<00:03:14.910> seal

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:15.910 
six hours four hours even overnight seal

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:18.180 
six hours four hours even overnight seal
it<00:03:16.090> with<00:03:16.299> the<00:03:16.440> plastic<00:03:17.440> wrap<00:03:17.620> and<00:03:17.650> you<00:03:17.920> put<00:03:18.069> it

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:18.190 
it with the plastic wrap and you put it

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:21.240 
it with the plastic wrap and you put it
in<00:03:18.310> the<00:03:18.489> oven<00:03:18.660> let<00:03:19.660> it<00:03:19.780> really<00:03:20.110> all<00:03:20.410> absorb<00:03:21.069> the

in the oven let it really all absorb the

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:22.920 
in the oven let it really all absorb the
flavors<00:03:21.670> get<00:03:21.970> tenderize<00:03:22.480> and<00:03:22.720> then<00:03:22.810> it's

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:22.930 
flavors get tenderize and then it's

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:26.370 
flavors get tenderize and then it's
gonna<00:03:23.049> be<00:03:23.140> ready<00:03:23.410> to<00:03:23.590> put<00:03:23.769> in<00:03:23.950> the<00:03:24.099> oven
