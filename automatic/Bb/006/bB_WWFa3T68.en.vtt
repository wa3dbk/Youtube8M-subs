machine that checks your stuff which

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:25.350 
machine that checks your stuff which
mine<00:01:23.830> was<00:01:24.190> but<00:01:24.520> they<00:01:24.700> didn't<00:01:25.030> know<00:01:25.179> that

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:25.360 
mine was but they didn't know that

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:27.570 
mine was but they didn't know that
against<00:01:25.690> yes<00:01:25.929> so<00:01:26.440> they<00:01:26.590> asked<00:01:26.950> me<00:01:27.130> to<00:01:27.160> take<00:01:27.550> it

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:27.580 
against yes so they asked me to take it

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:29.580 
against yes so they asked me to take it
out<00:01:27.789> or<00:01:28.030> maybe<00:01:28.180> either<00:01:28.450> machine<00:01:28.900> was<00:01:29.079> just<00:01:29.380> not

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:29.590 
out or maybe either machine was just not

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:31.730 
out or maybe either machine was just not
powerful<00:01:29.799> enough<00:01:30.100> but<00:01:30.729> this<00:01:31.000> has<00:01:31.210> really<00:01:31.450> been

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
powerful enough but this has really been

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.590 
powerful enough but this has really been
laid<00:01:32.740> off<00:01:32.979> review<00:01:33.790> of<00:01:33.880> the<00:01:34.060> airport's

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:34.600 
laid off review of the airport's

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:38.030 
laid off review of the airport's
checking<00:01:35.140> security<00:01:35.439> machine<00:01:36.220> not<00:01:36.790> the<00:01:37.180> video

checking security machine not the video
gun<00:01:39.040> of<00:01:39.310> track<00:01:40.020> so<00:01:41.020> let's<00:01:41.200> get<00:01:41.380> back<00:01:41.560> but<00:01:41.890> more

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:42.220 
gun of track so let's get back but more

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:43.920 
gun of track so let's get back but more
to<00:01:42.430> the<00:01:42.460> point<00:01:42.610> but<00:01:43.030> it's<00:01:43.180> great<00:01:43.420> there<00:01:43.600> wasn't

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:43.930 
to the point but it's great there wasn't

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:47.130 
to the point but it's great there wasn't
a<00:01:43.990> second<00:01:44.619> where<00:01:45.490> I<00:01:45.729> thought<00:01:46.149> that<00:01:46.750> you<00:01:46.990> know

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:47.140 
a second where I thought that you know

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:50.010 
a second where I thought that you know
there<00:01:47.590> is<00:01:47.619> a<00:01:48.159> room<00:01:48.549> for<00:01:48.820> improvement<00:01:49.570> in<00:01:49.720> this

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:50.020 
there is a room for improvement in this

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:52.289 
there is a room for improvement in this
machine<00:01:50.290> because<00:01:50.740> it's<00:01:50.890> definitely<00:01:51.369> as<00:01:51.549> light

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:52.299 
machine because it's definitely as light

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:55.440 
machine because it's definitely as light
as<00:01:52.770> computers<00:01:53.770> of<00:01:54.130> this<00:01:54.490> size<00:01:54.759> and<00:01:54.790> this<00:01:55.060> work

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:55.450 
as computers of this size and this work

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:57.719 
as computers of this size and this work
and<00:01:55.689> gain<00:01:55.899> right<00:01:56.110> now<00:01:56.320> and<00:01:56.590> it's<00:01:57.310> definitely

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:57.729 
and gain right now and it's definitely

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:00.120 
and gain right now and it's definitely
as<00:01:58.060> fun<00:01:58.360> as<00:01:58.570> Apple<00:01:58.960> can<00:01:59.140> make<00:01:59.350> their<00:01:59.560> computers

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:00.130 
as fun as Apple can make their computers

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:02.850 
as fun as Apple can make their computers
we<00:02:00.579> probably<00:02:00.909> will<00:02:01.630> see<00:02:01.869> something<00:02:02.560> even

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:02.860 
we probably will see something even

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:04.590 
we probably will see something even
thinner<00:02:03.130> in<00:02:03.369> the<00:02:03.670> future<00:02:04.000> because<00:02:04.149> of<00:02:04.390> course

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:04.600 
thinner in the future because of course

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:06.749 
thinner in the future because of course
five<00:02:04.840> years<00:02:05.079> ago<00:02:05.320> with<00:02:05.500> in<00:02:05.649> fig<00:02:05.890> something<00:02:06.549> as

00:02:06.749 --> 00:02:06.759 
five years ago with in fig something as

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:09.210 
five years ago with in fig something as
far<00:02:06.969> as<00:02:07.090> macbook<00:02:07.479> air<00:02:07.750> was<00:02:08.560> possible<00:02:08.979> but<00:02:09.160> i

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:09.220 
far as macbook air was possible but i

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:10.919 
far as macbook air was possible but i
think<00:02:09.459> it<00:02:09.579> was<00:02:09.640> four<00:02:09.910> years<00:02:09.940> ago<00:02:10.209> that<00:02:10.570> the

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:10.929 
think it was four years ago that the

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:13.470 
think it was four years ago that the
first<00:02:11.200> macbook<00:02:11.560> air<00:02:11.769> came<00:02:12.040> out<00:02:12.250> and<00:02:12.489> shop<00:02:13.180> the

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
first macbook air came out and shop the

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:15.300 
first macbook air came out and shop the
