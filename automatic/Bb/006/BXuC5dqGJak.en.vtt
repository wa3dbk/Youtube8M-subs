 Let's focus once again on this. 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:49.940

 Polarize, but if you look here, it's a song 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:10.380
 Let's do it like this. 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:13.560
 There's a laser engraver on the edge of the paper . 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:17.430
 Oakley is the most expensive of all. 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:21.390
 It's polarized . And now square is now in the process. 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:26.340
 There is a sticker that comes with up to nine minutes this is 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:29.640

 Thus the coating of Aya's so no light enters 

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:19.829
 At the Ready Reed Mall, now the total value is not red , but completely red 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:25.440
 The lens does not spend goreon 

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:29.040
 The part is so dark that there are many colors in this concentration. 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:31.699

 This will make you feel uncomfortable when you refer to the actual image 

00:05:32.289 --> 00:05:39.460
 What can I do to show my car as plated as possible? 

00:05:36.129 --> 00:05:42.759
