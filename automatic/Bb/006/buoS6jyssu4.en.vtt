00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
 if there now become two-fold 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:08.010
 Olympic champion in a row somewhere 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:10.469
 even with such people who achieved one 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.900
 curtains everything costs huge uncle German 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:16.980
 young i think i still still 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:18.750
 there was still a state of euphoria and thought 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:22.800
 both training in everything he did 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:25.019
 externally national heroes such selection 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.820
 here's the world championship athletes will be in 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:28.980
 okay maybe not justify not 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:32.189
 we will win but at least competition 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:34.890
 let's see what's what 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:40.440
 it's interesting to everyone it's 100 meters it's always 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:43.320
 like a diamond an interesting diamond 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:46.140
 race interesting people like we said 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:48.690
 good conditions up from the participants of this 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:51.360
 finals and nobody else out of 10 this year 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:54.210
 seconds did not run a breakthrough with us until only 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:56.579
 roy tyson gey probably made many of 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:01:00.600
 You have already watched this zamyatkin scene 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:02.940
 where he tried to sting so let's say 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:05.070
 I'll tell you to sting until those who sat on 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.080
 stands this I mean he did not bolt 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.960
 lined up let's find the tournament looked all 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:12.960
 from the side of blake and bolt did not act but 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:15.630
 tyson their territory dop showed better 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:18.720
 Season result who have not seen see 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:21.060
 tell me about what on wednesday 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.310
 our queen program on course yes 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:26.490
 we will be sure to disassemble this run 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:28.049
 we show it to you who will be able to 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.090
 turn to look and really 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:32.310
 either be locked yourself you saw very 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.640
 strange way on edwin's music now 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.990
 look like a bearded 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:41.040
 absolutely although so strange to them not 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:43.409
 interfered well and then the result of 986 itself for 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.929
 yourself very quickly and beautifully 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:51.619
 Well, here perhaps Justin Kotlin winner 

00:01:45.929 --> 00:01:55.859
 olympic games is a favorite on 

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:58.280
 in the same place 1006 in the same place all king tony all of them 

00:01:55.859 --> 00:01:58.280
 ran 

00:01:58.429 --> 00:02:04.170
 but there are 10 not yet 

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:06.209
 opportunity yourself jumped in principle necessary 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.500
 to such conditions run on 100 carter 

00:02:06.209 --> 00:02:09.119
 of course he tried to make 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.340
 competition 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:14.879
 cool tang ta that started before 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:16.680
 kingston but still here again 

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:19.140
 how many we state a little 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:21.299
 a little bit short is not here on this 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:23.760
 running this instead unfortunately 

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:26.400
 great starts but now before the end 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:28.829
 distances he often loses but 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:31.290
 justin so mature quite happy 

00:02:28.829 --> 00:02:33.480
 this was less kicked 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:35.549
 stations decided to let the city because 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:37.590
 that here you are, he says 

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:39.030
 the text did not offend with a beard when I 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:41.310
 I say it and the monster is like 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:43.379
 Now it is also, and this is also somehow still 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:46.709
 predatory new fashion see if it helps 

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:49.549
 this is the main usea bolt with a beard not 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:52.310
 see by chance we are alive still not too 

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:54.930
 maybe they are there, too, a new image and ready 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:57.650
 at 100 meters the head is logical and 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:57.650
 sensible come out 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:02.140
 but 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:07.760
 here's no false start what 's beautiful 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:10.670
 conditions need to run the place as always 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:13.760
 starts cool well yes the master takes care 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:16.760
 rogers how to win 997 and what we 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:20.060
 spoke here poverty 10 seconds okay 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:21.260
 I then had a bit difficult but they are 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:24.079
 we know sprinters 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:26.510
 well, what they start and what they then 

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:29.269
 the season ends the legs are skinny like you 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:32.840
 sit down at everyone you are such a pecan and we 

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:34.519
 they really need to write out nothing 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:36.980
 you can do a huge amount of work 

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:39.799
 considering again the Americans who 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:42.290
 there was no winter european championship in this 

00:03:39.799 --> 00:03:44.989
 the year was therefore Spain in the winter were all 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:47.780
 that it does not involve much work 

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:50.840
 but I think that justin holds the mark 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:53.690
 after all that happened before here he is 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:55.400
 he returned to do only Ukrainians yes 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:04:00.069
 Well what can I say 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:04:02.750
 well done well done very hard 

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:09.139
 stable dinner and justifies in general 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:10.400
 so let's say even your favorites when 

00:04:09.139 --> 00:04:12.380
 he came back at all 

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:13.880
 after disqualification so somehow 

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:15.769
 a boy in general still beating 

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:17.840
 incomprehensible even difficult was all the prize 

00:04:15.769 --> 00:04:24.289
 further in london with such people and yes 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:26.270
 which bolt and glue will be the third note 

00:04:24.289 --> 00:04:29.360
 fought here by the way here's good 

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:31.580
 rogers up made up the competition i'm honest 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:33.349
 saying did not expect after all he is somewhere 60 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:35.270
 meters closer to you cool now a hundred 

00:04:33.349 --> 00:04:37.370
 hundred runs from the jury place after all 

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:38.349
 the second did not spend so much christmas 

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:40.669
 second me 

00:04:38.349 --> 00:04:44.000
 very by the way nice too they are somewhere 

00:04:40.669 --> 00:04:46.970
 close and 99 can be you up to 99 y 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:53.360
 both rogers tan all over 10 seconds 

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:53.630
 great now this is somehow pretty good 

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:56.810
 there is 

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:59.630
 Tyson made such a breakthrough 

00:04:56.810 --> 00:05:01.930
 But for the people it's hairstyles have no 

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:03.050
 supports for auditions the house itself is the length 

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:05.060
 more 

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:07.520
 along wrap it decomposes 

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:16.009
 initially all became tones for him 

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:17.840
 or for the leader, but I have to say that 1 

00:05:16.009 --> 00:05:20.659
 so keep calling 

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:23.389
 my friends note the price for the nose 

00:05:20.659 --> 00:05:25.699
 thousand 04 Feb 04 Kim Kalina 

00:05:23.389 --> 00:05:28.340
 Well, so quietly quiet, he is here in the season 

00:05:25.699 --> 00:05:30.650
 then they are selected where the final was there 

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:31.340
 complete begin to lie when running with 

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:34.610
 fine 

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:37.009
 very nice molodetsky mule alyosha 

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:41.960
 And girls give tank with such 

00:05:37.009 --> 00:05:44.330
 the wind is 2 meters and now do not go on 

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:46.250
 these in the region of 1 meter is very comfortable 

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:48.070
 most comfortable grater when too 

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:50.740
 much wind is very different to control 

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:55.520
 control having lived then I am already very 

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:57.370
 hard to get on the usa knock will give 

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:59.690
 Generally difficult this meter and a half 

00:05:57.370 --> 00:06:02.240
 in passing, and here's what you need easy 

00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:03.440
 passing breeze that create run 

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:06.500
 visible resistance 

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:10.180
 you feeling that helps and at the same time 

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:10.180
 everything can control everything 

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:17.030
 demonstrative footage went with 

00:06:14.599 --> 00:06:21.400
 terrible ready well and the girls are preparing 

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:21.400
 run 400 meters this is a cool race
