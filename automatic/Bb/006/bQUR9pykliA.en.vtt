00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:10.290
 good how about one more time entering 

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:15.100
 equipment this time not 500 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:18.640
 a pretty economical amplifier the 

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:22.380
 truth that I have already used not in other 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:24.820
 opportunities did not come 900 that too 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.800
 It works very well 

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:28.030
 and the truth is that the price is quite 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:31.990
 low 

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:34.780
 let's open it and let's go I'm going to show 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:38.190
 more or less what the specification 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:38.190
 that they have as is the amplifier 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:44.010
 this is complicated with just one hand 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:01.030
 do not 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.430
 ah 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:09.810
 ah 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:12.690
 to 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:30.580
 normal instruction 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:39.810
 are the models of not innovating new 500 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:42.509
 the smallest follow you 900 new that is 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:46.190
 the other we have after 1500 and 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:49.430
 2500 the 2500 comes with a 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:53.000
 display on the front that we can 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:54.930
 visualize the temperature of each of 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.460
 the 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:59.000
 and the amplifier is divided into 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.000
 two parts 

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:07.860
 an interlock cable 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:07.860
 of current 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:15.750
 the fifth notifier 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:15.750
 which was that we put in one hand 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:40.630
 good 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:47.830
 this would be the amplifier we have 

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:50.940
 In the back 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:50.940
 between ventilation 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:56.920
 we have the audio input we have in 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:03:01.420
 canon chips 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:04.090
 we have a club of six and half rsa all 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:06.100
 are inputs calculations that can be 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:09.100
 clean so 

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:11.590
 to leave if we have some other 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:15.270
 amplifier we can if we have input 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:18.569
 in plus we can take out in rsa or xlr 

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:22.350
 after this 

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:25.020
 it's a little more complicated 

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:28.290
 what would be the mass 

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:30.630
 the limiter that is the limiter of 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:34.410
 amplification output I do not use it 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:36.270
 because this is for the people who give 

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:38.670
 volume and 

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:41.040
 and click on the amplifier and they follow 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:43.650
 giving volume thus spoil the 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:46.200
 speakers after we have the way in 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:52.070
 that works the external amplifier in 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:54.660
 parallel if we put one 

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:57.210
 audio input we put it in parallel 

00:03:54.660 --> 00:04:00.330
 the entrance that we put in the channel 

00:03:57.210 --> 00:04:04.050
 one is going to take the copy in the channel 

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:06.930
 2 then we have the sensitivity while 

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:09.710
 the more sensitive the voltage is going 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:13.550
 listen louder 

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:17.180
 audio output the stripped and spy cable 

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:19.009
 with entry 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:21.340
 of what is the interblock of the 

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:25.000
 current 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:27.310
 and in the front is good would come 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.300
 to be in dissipation with the cooler 

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:34.650
 in 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:37.949
 in the front part we have 

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:39.920
 in the potentiometers of channel 1 and the 

00:04:37.949 --> 00:04:42.689
 Channel 2 

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:46.750
 and on and off 

00:04:42.689 --> 00:04:50.110
 what would be the led luminaire 

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:53.320
 bridge mode would be using the two 

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:57.070
 channels in a single output good on let 

00:04:53.320 --> 00:05:00.540
 the power the whereabouts led 

00:04:57.070 --> 00:05:00.540
 click and sra protection 

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:07.400
 well I explain 

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:12.050
 in the power that brings this works 

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:16.430
 up to 4 we have 150 watts per night 

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:18.950
 channels at 4 250 watts per channels and 

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:22.640
 bridge to bridge mode 

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:24.280
 we have an output of 500 watts in 4000 

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:27.300
 if I'm not wrong 

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:29.200
 that would be the amplifier did not come 

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:30.620
 also for what would come to be 

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:32.360
 rental 

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:34.510
 I hope you liked it we'll see you 

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:34.510
 next
