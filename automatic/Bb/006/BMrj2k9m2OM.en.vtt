00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:41.950
 things with desire and so things do not 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:44.110

 subscribe I will upload videos like this every 

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:05.530
 that we can practice especially 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.540
 what you ask me about the issues 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:09.490
 that I want to share with you about 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:12.430
 what I like about what I do as 

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:15.810

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:15.810
 I send you a kiss 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:25.810
 well the first pass like that is super super 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:29.319
 super important that your lights serve 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:31.680
 all because if they are not going to look like 

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:31.680
 fire 

00:02:43.219 --> 00:02:52.000
 then of the little ones 

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:54.540
 well let's start by taking the extreme 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.540
 from a shore 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:58.980
 where to keep it from getting entangled in 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:01.020
 noble arganzuela because if they are not going to 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:03.020
 take longer we will take a long time and 

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:06.540
 we started here by the board 

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:09.950
 identify the tip ok and good 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:09.950
 let's start doing this fast 

00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:04.430
 just like this we do so on 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:07.480
 said if we cut another piece equal 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:07.480
 another piece 

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:17.060
 the other no more 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:20.049
 and the way we want when 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:20.049
 You 

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:30.820
 right now we see how it looks like by hitting on 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:45.210
 the outline of where you want what 

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:50.240
 You can stick what I want on the bed 

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:50.240
 and put them in each part 

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:55.000
 well, how much is still up 

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:56.530
 making a few small worlds and it's going to 

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.190
 see very nice already because you are going to see 

00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:59.190
 different 

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:08.940
 very well I put it on top of each 

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:13.170
 piece of micro tape by 

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:17.460
 Okay, that's how it's going to be ok 

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:20.880
 well we finished our tutorial 

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:24.300
 to put it this way in position then fast or 

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:25.940
 it was very fast I did not take anything nothing 

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:29.780
 nothing nothing 

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:31.580
 it 's very easy to do it, it's like that 

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:34.580
 easy easy and I told you only 

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:37.280
 with lights as well as Christmas lights could 

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:39.620
 be do not throw them or be and preferably 

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:41.990
 that are white in case their 

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:44.260
 little ones will melt there 

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:47.030
 spare parts and can be put is very easy 

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:48.889
 just remove the little remove the 

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:51.160
 little of this one 

00:05:48.889 --> 00:05:53.710
 they are detached 

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:55.930
 and they place a new one they do not have to have 

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:58.990
 be careful because sometimes this little thing 

00:05:55.930 --> 00:06:01.890
 here it breaks then very careful and 

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:01.890
 so we stay 

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:12.430
 in case you have a 

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:14.290
 lamp or some candles this lamp 

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:15.610
 of lava equal looks very fine only 

00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:17.470
 that I just connected you and good at what 

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:19.090
 that heats up the same can ignite 

00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:20.920
 some candles right now because it 's day 

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:22.510
 close the curtain so that a 

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:25.690
 little bit of life observer, well, good 

00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:28.000
 in the same at night it looks very good is 

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:30.190
 for a light very tempered very short 

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.290
 and very comfortable the truth is super 

00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:34.330
 easy and then start decorating this 

00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:38.020
