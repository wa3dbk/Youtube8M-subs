timing<00:02:36.670> from<00:02:37.120> fanatic<00:02:37.540> because<00:02:37.750> look<00:02:37.959> at<00:02:38.020> the

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.110 
timing from fanatic because look at the

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:40.020 
timing from fanatic because look at the
top<00:02:38.290> wing<00:02:38.530> here<00:02:38.770> the<00:02:39.040> wave<00:02:39.250> was<00:02:39.430> in<00:02:39.610> the<00:02:39.760> middle

top wing here the wave was in the middle
so<00:02:40.180> wicked<00:02:40.480> couldn't<00:02:40.780> push<00:02:40.900> it<00:02:40.989> down<00:02:41.080> fast

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:41.380 
so wicked couldn't push it down fast

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:42.750 
so wicked couldn't push it down fast
enough<00:02:41.500> to<00:02:41.739> get<00:02:41.830> a<00:02:41.890> lot<00:02:42.100> of<00:02:42.130> hits<00:02:42.340> on<00:02:42.459> the<00:02:42.580> towel

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:42.760 
enough to get a lot of hits on the towel

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:44.880 
enough to get a lot of hits on the towel
in<00:02:43.209> the<00:02:43.390> mid<00:02:43.540> lane<00:02:43.720> as<00:02:43.870> well<00:02:44.050> peg<00:02:44.500> had<00:02:44.650> just

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:44.890 
in the mid lane as well peg had just

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:46.710 
in the mid lane as well peg had just
cleared<00:02:45.190> the<00:02:45.280> entire<00:02:45.700> wave<00:02:46.030> so<00:02:46.239> fragen<00:02:46.600> would

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:46.720 
cleared the entire wave so fragen would

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:48.570 
cleared the entire wave so fragen would
be<00:02:46.900> able<00:02:46.959> to<00:02:47.140> push<00:02:47.290> on<00:02:47.410> the<00:02:47.500> tower<00:02:47.709> either<00:02:48.010> so

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:48.580 
be able to push on the tower either so

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:50.310 
be able to push on the tower either so
it's<00:02:48.700> just<00:02:48.880> very<00:02:49.150> good<00:02:49.450> timing<00:02:49.870> they<00:02:50.110> didn't

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:50.320 
it's just very good timing they didn't

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:52.080 
it's just very good timing they didn't
lose<00:02:50.410> any<00:02:50.680> damage<00:02:51.190> on<00:02:51.280> their<00:02:51.400> own<00:02:51.519> towels<00:02:51.820> and
