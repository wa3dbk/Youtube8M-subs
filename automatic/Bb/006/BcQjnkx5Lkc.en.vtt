00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
bones why I'm picking this is because

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.330 
bones why I'm picking this is because
they're<00:00:26.910> very<00:00:27.119> high<00:00:27.570> in<00:00:28.130> connective<00:00:29.130> tissue

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
they're very high in connective tissue

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.189 
they're very high in connective tissue
or<00:00:29.519> a<00:00:29.580> lot<00:00:29.699> of<00:00:29.820> cartilage<00:00:30.090> ligaments<00:00:30.900> tendons

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
or a lot of cartilage ligaments tendons

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:32.990 
or a lot of cartilage ligaments tendons
to<00:00:31.529> stuff<00:00:31.740> it<00:00:31.830> up<00:00:31.949> so<00:00:32.340> that<00:00:32.520> will<00:00:32.640> actually

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
to stuff it up so that will actually

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.240 
to stuff it up so that will actually
kill<00:00:33.300> the<00:00:33.510> olara<00:00:33.719> a<00:00:34.050> lotta<00:00:34.500> gelatin<00:00:34.950> which<00:00:35.100> is

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
kill the olara a lotta gelatin which is

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.130 
kill the olara a lotta gelatin which is
actually<00:00:35.790> what<00:00:35.969> we're<00:00:36.120> looking<00:00:36.360> for<00:00:36.390> in

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
actually what we're looking for in

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:38.479 
actually what we're looking for in
addition<00:00:37.380> to<00:00:37.649> that<00:00:37.770> the<00:00:37.950> neck<00:00:38.129> bones<00:00:38.340> they

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
addition to that the neck bones they

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.280 
addition to that the neck bones they
contain<00:00:38.820> a<00:00:38.850> lot<00:00:39.059> of<00:00:39.180> meat<00:00:39.329> so<00:00:39.360> then<00:00:39.809> they

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
contain a lot of meat so then they

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:41.600 
contain a lot of meat so then they
themselves<00:00:40.860> they<00:00:40.950> can<00:00:41.070> actually<00:00:41.219> add<00:00:41.579> more

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
themselves they can actually add more

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.750 
themselves they can actually add more
flavor<00:00:42.329> more<00:00:42.930> the<00:00:43.230> way<00:00:43.350> I<00:00:43.379> like<00:00:43.649> it<00:00:43.680> what<00:00:44.640> you

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
can use as far as raw material you can

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.709 
can use as far as raw material you can
go<00:00:46.739> with<00:00:46.950> the<00:00:47.039> chicken<00:00:47.520> parts<00:00:47.820> like<00:00:48.000> necks<00:00:48.270> and

go with the chicken parts like necks and

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.990 
go with the chicken parts like necks and
feed<00:00:49.200> impacts<00:00:49.649> would<00:00:49.920> be<00:00:50.039> ideal<00:00:50.520> it<00:00:50.730> will<00:00:50.850> make

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
feed impacts would be ideal it will make

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.939 
feed impacts would be ideal it will make
a<00:00:51.030> really<00:00:51.510> really<00:00:51.750> tasty<00:00:52.170> chicken<00:00:52.649> Brooke

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
high in gelatin and you can also use you

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.500 
high in gelatin and you can also use you
know<00:00:55.530> all<00:00:55.770> kinds<00:00:55.920> of<00:00:56.160> you<00:00:56.340> know<00:00:56.370> from<00:00:56.850> beef<00:00:57.480> to

bison to a lamb

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.270 
bison to a lamb
bones<00:01:00.870> and<00:01:01.230> they<00:01:01.440> will<00:01:01.620> actually<00:01:01.890> do<00:01:02.070> almost

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
bones and they will actually do almost

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:03.740 
bones and they will actually do almost
the<00:01:02.489> same<00:01:02.550> job<00:01:02.910> for<00:01:03.059> a<00:01:03.120> different<00:01:03.449> flavor<00:01:03.660> of

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
the same job for a different flavor of

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.200 
the same job for a different flavor of
course<00:01:04.110> the<00:01:04.920> preparation<00:01:05.460> is<00:01:05.580> quite<00:01:05.760> easy<00:01:06.030> in

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
course the preparation is quite easy in

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.060 
course the preparation is quite easy in
the<00:01:06.420> case<00:01:06.600> now<00:01:06.810> that<00:01:06.840> I'm<00:01:07.110> actually<00:01:07.260> using<00:01:07.500> all

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
the case now that I'm actually using all

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.520 
the case now that I'm actually using all
these<00:01:08.220> cow<00:01:08.490> feet<00:01:08.820> and<00:01:09.030> and<00:01:09.930> neck<00:01:10.110> bones<00:01:10.320> with

these cow feet and and neck bones with
the<00:01:10.560> calculator<00:01:11.130> I'm<00:01:11.220> gonna<00:01:11.400> do<00:01:11.549> is<00:01:11.640> that<00:01:11.729> I'm

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
the calculator I'm gonna do is that I'm

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.550 
the calculator I'm gonna do is that I'm
gonna<00:01:12.000> wash<00:01:12.360> them<00:01:12.570> really<00:01:12.810> really<00:01:12.960> good<00:01:13.350> and

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
gonna wash them really really good and

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.260 
gonna wash them really really good and
this<00:01:13.979> may<00:01:14.130> take<00:01:14.310> several<00:01:14.580> hours<00:01:14.880> actually

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
this may take several hours actually

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.080 
this may take several hours actually
keeping<00:01:15.750> them<00:01:15.869> under<00:01:16.259> running<00:01:16.470> water<00:01:17.090> ideally

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
keeping them under running water ideally

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.399 
keeping them under running water ideally
what<00:01:18.299> you<00:01:18.420> want<00:01:18.540> to<00:01:18.689> do<00:01:18.810> is<00:01:18.930> just<00:01:19.140> grab<00:01:19.350> the

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
bones put them in a bowl put them under

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.289 
bones put them in a bowl put them under
the<00:01:22.799> water<00:01:23.070> sink<00:01:23.640> make<00:01:23.820> sure<00:01:23.939> that<00:01:24.060> the<00:01:24.150> water

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
the water sink make sure that the water

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:25.760 
the water sink make sure that the water
is<00:01:24.420> actually<00:01:24.570> high<00:01:24.869> quality<00:01:25.229> of<00:01:25.290> course<00:01:25.530> you

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
is actually high quality of course you

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:26.870 
is actually high quality of course you
don't<00:01:25.920> want<00:01:25.950> to<00:01:26.130> you<00:01:26.280> know<00:01:26.369> load<00:01:26.670> him<00:01:26.790> up

don't want to you know load him up

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.850 
don't want to you know load him up
without<00:01:27.270> chlorine<00:01:27.540> and<00:01:28.020> you<00:01:28.380> just<00:01:28.500> watch<00:01:28.680> them

without chlorine and you just watch them

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.260 
without chlorine and you just watch them
over<00:01:28.979> and<00:01:29.130> over<00:01:29.310> so<00:01:29.579> you<00:01:29.670> give<00:01:29.820> it<00:01:29.939> a<00:01:30.000> call

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
over and over so you give it a call

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.660 
over and over so you give it a call
there<00:01:30.950> anything<00:01:31.950> that<00:01:32.189> could<00:01:32.310> be<00:01:32.340> realized

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
there anything that could be realized

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:33.460

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:20.000 
several hours and right now what I have

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.009 
several hours and right now what I have
is<00:03:20.650> is<00:03:21.650> the<00:03:21.800> phone<00:03:21.980> that<00:03:22.190> pretty<00:03:22.430> much<00:03:22.550> have

00:03:23.009 --> 00:03:23.019 
is is the phone that pretty much have

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:28.509 
is is the phone that pretty much have
themself<00:03:24.040> drain<00:03:25.040> slowly<00:03:25.670> away<00:03:27.190> and<00:03:28.190> there's

00:03:28.509 --> 00:03:28.519 
themself drain slowly away and there's

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:29.440 
themself drain slowly away and there's
two<00:03:28.640> things<00:03:28.670> that<00:03:28.849> we<00:03:28.970> can<00:03:29.060> do<00:03:29.269> with<00:03:29.390> these

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:29.450 
two things that we can do with these

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:31.390 
two things that we can do with these
bombs<00:03:29.690> we<00:03:29.959> can<00:03:30.140> discard<00:03:30.440> him<00:03:30.620> we<00:03:30.980> can<00:03:31.130> eat<00:03:31.250> some

bombs we can discard him we can eat some

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:32.949 
bombs we can discard him we can eat some
of<00:03:31.519> that<00:03:31.550> connective<00:03:32.030> tissue<00:03:32.209> or<00:03:32.720> we<00:03:32.840> can

00:03:32.949 --> 00:03:32.959 
of that connective tissue or we can

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:34.540 
of that connective tissue or we can
actually<00:03:33.110> put<00:03:33.440> him<00:03:33.530> back<00:03:33.680> in<00:03:33.860> the<00:03:33.950> pot<00:03:34.130> once<00:03:34.400> we

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:34.550 
actually put him back in the pot once we

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:36.520 
actually put him back in the pot once we
have<00:03:34.730> traded<00:03:35.000> for<00:03:35.569> the<00:03:35.660> top<00:03:35.810> for<00:03:36.050> the<00:03:36.110> gelatin

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:36.530 
have traded for the top for the gelatin

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:38.559 
have traded for the top for the gelatin
add<00:03:36.950> more<00:03:37.310> vinegar<00:03:37.519> a<00:03:37.849> little<00:03:38.180> bit<00:03:38.269> more<00:03:38.420> this

00:03:38.559 --> 00:03:38.569 
add more vinegar a little bit more this

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:40.630 
add more vinegar a little bit more this
time<00:03:38.810> and<00:03:39.110> this<00:03:39.800> moment<00:03:40.010> will<00:03:40.190> actually<00:03:40.489> will

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:40.640 
time and this moment will actually will

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:42.940 
time and this moment will actually will
eventually<00:03:41.030> begin<00:03:41.450> to<00:03:41.780> break<00:03:42.019> down<00:03:42.200> and<00:03:42.470> this

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:42.950 
eventually begin to break down and this

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:44.440 
eventually begin to break down and this
will<00:03:43.160> give<00:03:43.340> you<00:03:43.459> the<00:03:43.580> mineral<00:03:44.000> brought<00:03:44.269> that

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:18.950 
have to skim all the fat of the top of

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:20.620 
have to skim all the fat of the top of
it<00:04:19.100> afraid<00:04:19.760> of<00:04:19.820> it<00:04:20.000> you<00:04:20.030> don't<00:04:20.239> want<00:04:20.450> to<00:04:20.510> use

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:20.630 
it afraid of it you don't want to use

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:23.409 
it afraid of it you don't want to use
none<00:04:20.989> of<00:04:21.019> that<00:04:21.139> fat<00:04:21.440> and<00:04:21.760> the<00:04:22.760> gelatine<00:04:23.120> stop

00:04:23.409 --> 00:04:23.419 
none of that fat and the gelatine stop

00:04:23.419 --> 00:04:24.610 
none of that fat and the gelatine stop
then<00:04:23.600> you<00:04:23.630> will<00:04:23.840> put<00:04:24.139> it<00:04:24.260> in<00:04:24.320> smaller

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:24.620 
then you will put it in smaller

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:26.980 
then you will put it in smaller
containers<00:04:25.190> let<00:04:25.820> it<00:04:25.910> cool<00:04:26.030> off<00:04:26.150> eventually

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:26.990 
containers let it cool off eventually

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:28.690 
containers let it cool off eventually
will<00:04:27.110> go<00:04:27.229> into<00:04:27.410> the<00:04:27.500> freezer<00:04:27.860> if<00:04:28.250> you<00:04:28.400> put<00:04:28.610> it

00:04:30.279 --> 00:04:30.289 
to the freezer make sure that you do it

00:04:30.289 --> 00:04:32.260 
to the freezer make sure that you do it
with<00:04:30.320> glass<00:04:30.770> jars<00:04:31.160> and<00:04:31.669> those<00:04:31.850> yours<00:04:32.120> are

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:32.270 
with glass jars and those yours are

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:33.820 
with glass jars and those yours are
gonna<00:04:32.389> be<00:04:32.539> only<00:04:32.690> feel<00:04:32.990> about<00:04:33.229> three<00:04:33.470> quarters

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:33.830 
gonna be only feel about three quarters

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:35.469 
gonna be only feel about three quarters

00:04:35.469 --> 00:04:35.479 
since when it begins to freeze it will

00:04:35.479 --> 00:04:38.110 
since when it begins to freeze it will
expand<00:04:35.870> and<00:04:36.139> in<00:04:36.410> my<00:04:36.500> crack<00:04:36.770> a<00:04:36.800> jar<00:04:37.130> and<00:04:37.370> that's
