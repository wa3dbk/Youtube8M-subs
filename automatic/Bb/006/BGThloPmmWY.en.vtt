and we're going to use an inline sinker
inline<00:00:23.490> sinkers<00:00:23.850> come<00:00:24.060> in<00:00:24.180> a<00:00:24.269> variety<00:00:24.420> of

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
sizes the best size is going to depend

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.410 
sizes the best size is going to depend
on<00:00:28.080> the<00:00:28.199> water<00:00:28.410> level<00:00:28.920> in<00:00:29.039> the<00:00:29.130> river<00:00:29.390> when<00:00:30.390> the

on the water level in the river when the

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.359 
on the water level in the river when the
waters<00:00:30.779> all<00:00:30.960> low<00:00:31.470> you'll<00:00:31.890> want<00:00:32.099> to<00:00:32.160> use<00:00:32.219> a

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
waters all low you'll want to use a

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.060 
waters all low you'll want to use a
little<00:00:32.669> smaller<00:00:32.969> size<00:00:33.270> when<00:00:33.540> the<00:00:33.630> waters

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:34.070 
little smaller size when the waters

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:36.590 
little smaller size when the waters
higher<00:00:35.070> and<00:00:35.399> there's<00:00:35.940> more<00:00:36.090> current<00:00:36.480> you'll

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
higher and there's more current you'll

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.930 
higher and there's more current you'll
need<00:00:36.750> to<00:00:36.809> use<00:00:36.870> a<00:00:36.960> little<00:00:37.170> heavier<00:00:37.410> sinker

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
need to use a little heavier sinker

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.610

so the best thing we'll do is we'll just

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:46.190 
so the best thing we'll do is we'll just
tie<00:00:41.210> our<00:00:42.210> monofilament<00:00:43.050> onto<00:00:44.239> the<00:00:45.239> inline
