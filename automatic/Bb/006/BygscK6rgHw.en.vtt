00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:33.100 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:37.110 

I<00:00:33.960> lived<00:00:34.960> at<00:00:35.199> the<00:00:35.320> end<00:00:35.469> of<00:00:35.559> days<00:00:35.769> I<00:00:36.129> was<00:00:37.000> the

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:37.120 
I lived at the end of days I was the

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:39.860 
I lived at the end of days I was the
very<00:00:37.329> last<00:00:37.480> child<00:00:37.839> to<00:00:38.019> be<00:00:38.140> born

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
very last child to be born

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.220 
very last child to be born
as<00:00:39.930> I<00:00:39.989> grew<00:00:40.829> up<00:00:41.010> everyone<00:00:41.850> I<00:00:41.969> knew<00:00:42.120> died<00:00:42.480> one<00:00:43.199> by

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
as I grew up everyone I knew died one by

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.360 
as I grew up everyone I knew died one by
one<00:00:43.680> until<00:00:44.090> eventually<00:00:45.090> it<00:00:45.629> was<00:00:45.840> just<00:00:46.170> me<00:00:46.379> all

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
one until eventually it was just me all

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.479 
one until eventually it was just me all
their<00:00:48.000> dreams<00:00:48.360> fell<00:00:48.690> on<00:00:48.840> my<00:00:48.960> shoulders<00:00:49.379> I<00:00:49.649> was

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
their dreams fell on my shoulders I was

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.639 
their dreams fell on my shoulders I was
your<00:00:50.699> last<00:00:50.879> hope<00:00:51.199> it<00:00:52.199> was<00:00:52.379> too<00:00:52.559> much<00:00:52.769> so<00:00:53.460> I<00:00:53.489> left

00:00:54.639 --> 00:00:54.649 
your last hope it was too much so I left

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:57.040 
your last hope it was too much so I left
sure<00:00:55.649> maybe<00:00:56.220> I<00:00:56.309> couldn't<00:00:56.579> go<00:00:56.640> home<00:00:56.790> again

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:57.050 
sure maybe I couldn't go home again

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:02.110 
sure maybe I couldn't go home again
maybe<00:00:58.050> I<00:00:58.140> couldn't<00:00:58.470> make<00:00:58.559> everyone

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:02.120 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:04.060 

but<00:01:02.750> the<00:01:02.930> very<00:01:03.140> least<00:01:03.379> I<00:01:03.559> could<00:01:03.680> rebuild<00:01:03.920> a

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:04.070 
but the very least I could rebuild a

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:09.070 
but the very least I could rebuild a
future<00:01:04.400> where<00:01:04.519> everyone<00:01:04.909> could<00:01:05.030> survive<00:01:08.049> so<00:01:09.049> I

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:09.080 
future where everyone could survive so I

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:11.080 
future where everyone could survive so I
went<00:01:09.320> through<00:01:09.500> the<00:01:09.560> gate<00:01:09.830> I<00:01:10.100> wasn't<00:01:10.820> thinking

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:11.090 
went through the gate I wasn't thinking

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:14.490 
went through the gate I wasn't thinking
very<00:01:11.270> clearly

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:14.500 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:16.590

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
out I didn't know what it really meant

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.780

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:19.950 
to live it would bring contradiction to

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:25.920 
to live it would bring contradiction to
to<00:03:20.950> the<00:03:21.160> timeline<00:03:22.440> yeah<00:03:23.459> but<00:03:24.459> why<00:03:24.930> it's

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:25.930 
to the timeline yeah but why it's

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:30.030 
to the timeline yeah but why it's
because<00:03:26.350> of<00:03:26.380> us<00:03:27.360> just<00:03:28.360> like<00:03:28.600> I<00:03:28.870> said<00:03:29.290> we're

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:30.040 
because of us just like I said we're

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:33.870 
because of us just like I said we're
causing<00:03:30.370> a<00:03:30.640> paradox<00:03:30.880> to<00:03:31.360> occur<00:03:32.670> because<00:03:33.670> of

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:33.880 
causing a paradox to occur because of

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:41.830 
causing a paradox to occur because of
that<00:03:34.209> no<00:03:34.510> it's<00:03:35.610> just<00:03:39.780> highest

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:41.840 
that no it's just highest

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:47.420 
that no it's just highest
Gaius<00:03:42.840> is<00:03:43.379> not<00:03:43.769> here<00:03:45.200> you<00:03:46.200> mean<00:03:46.409> he's<00:03:46.920> not<00:03:47.159> here

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:47.430 
Gaius is not here you mean he's not here

00:03:47.430 --> 00:04:02.300 
Gaius is not here you mean he's not here
in<00:03:47.549> the<00:03:47.640> city<00:03:49.579> yo<00:03:50.579> hold<00:03:51.060> on<00:03:51.209> please

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:02.310 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:09.760
