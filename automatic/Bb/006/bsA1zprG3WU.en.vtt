pretty decent for a quick eyelash
I<00:00:40.550> tried<00:00:41.550> red<00:00:41.969> cherry<00:00:42.390> and<00:00:43.020> you<00:00:43.710> haven't

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
other than Mac but I'm starting to

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:51.680 
other than Mac but I'm starting to
branch<00:00:48.450> out<00:00:48.690> a<00:00:48.750> little<00:00:48.930> bit<00:00:49.289> more<00:00:50.329> these<00:00:51.329> were

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
branch out a little bit more these were

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.380 
branch out a little bit more these were
only<00:00:51.840> about<00:00:52.260> two<00:00:52.949> dollars<00:00:53.129> and<00:00:53.760> fifty<00:00:53.910> cents

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
only about two dollars and fifty cents

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.229 
only about two dollars and fifty cents
each<00:00:54.770> they<00:00:55.770> can<00:00:55.949> range<00:00:56.250> from<00:00:56.460> two<00:00:56.910> to<00:00:57.059> two

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
each they can range from two to two

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:00.200 
each they can range from two to two
fifty<00:00:57.420> depending<00:00:58.140> where<00:00:58.379> you<00:00:58.559> get<00:00:58.770> them<00:00:59.210> and

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
fifty depending where you get them and

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.290 
fifty depending where you get them and
I've<00:01:01.020> only<00:01:01.320> actually<00:01:01.559> tried<00:01:02.129> two<00:01:02.609> pairs<00:01:02.969> so

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
I've only actually tried two pairs so

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.980 
I've only actually tried two pairs so
far<00:01:03.739> but<00:01:04.739> I<00:01:05.339> mean<00:01:05.729> for<00:01:05.909> the<00:01:06.060> price<00:01:06.240> they're

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
far but I mean for the price they're

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.840 
far but I mean for the price they're
really<00:01:07.320> good

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
really good

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.350 
really good
I'll<00:01:09.240> just<00:01:09.479> compare<00:01:09.990> them<00:01:10.229> to<00:01:10.640> the<00:01:11.640> number<00:01:11.939> 99

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
I'll just compare them to the number 99

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.179 
I'll just compare them to the number 99
I<00:01:12.900> got<00:01:13.110> because<00:01:13.439> I<00:01:13.560> thought<00:01:13.710> they<00:01:13.890> were<00:01:13.950> like

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
I got because I thought they were like

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:18.140 
I got because I thought they were like
than<00:01:14.520> Mac<00:01:14.700> number<00:01:15.299> seven<00:01:16.640> I'm<00:01:17.640> a<00:01:17.670> little<00:01:18.030> bit

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
than Mac number seven I'm a little bit

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.660 
than Mac number seven I'm a little bit
different<00:01:18.360> but<00:01:19.290> probably<00:01:19.830> the<00:01:20.070> closest<00:01:20.490> that

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
different but probably the closest that

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.649 
different but probably the closest that
you'll<00:01:20.850> get<00:01:21.000> to<00:01:21.210> those<00:01:21.500> now<00:01:23.090> the<00:01:24.090> thing<00:01:24.330> about

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
you'll get to those now the thing about

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.230 
you'll get to those now the thing about
these<00:01:24.960> flashes<00:01:25.740> you<00:01:26.729> I<00:01:26.759> mean<00:01:27.090> they're

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
these flashes you I mean they're

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.560 
these flashes you I mean they're
definitely<00:01:27.450> like<00:01:27.810> cheaper<00:01:28.320> quality<00:01:29.329> it<00:01:30.329> does

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
definitely like cheaper quality it does

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.410 
definitely like cheaper quality it does
say<00:01:30.900> a<00:01:30.930> hundred<00:01:31.380> percent<00:01:31.500> human<00:01:32.159> hair<00:01:32.220> which<00:01:32.880> I

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
say a hundred percent human hair which I

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.530 
say a hundred percent human hair which I
guess<00:01:34.229> is<00:01:34.500> good<00:01:34.860> I<00:01:35.220> don't<00:01:35.280> know<00:01:35.610> like<00:01:36.180> what

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
guess is good I don't know like what

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.530 
guess is good I don't know like what
kind<00:01:36.570> of<00:01:37.049> here<00:01:37.380> where<00:01:37.979> you<00:01:38.250> would<00:01:38.460> get<00:01:39.270> that

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
kind of here where you would get that

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.030 
kind of here where you would get that
because<00:01:39.930> it<00:01:40.079> doesn't<00:01:40.259> really<00:01:40.470> look<00:01:40.979> like

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
because it doesn't really look like

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.999 
because it doesn't really look like
eyelashes<00:01:41.939> I'm<00:01:42.060> not<00:01:42.210> quite<00:01:42.509> sure<00:01:42.540> about<00:01:43.140> that

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
eyelashes I'm not quite sure about that

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:48.800 
eyelashes I'm not quite sure about that
but<00:01:44.430> um<00:01:45.530> the<00:01:46.530> bans<00:01:46.799> the<00:01:47.490> lash<00:01:47.729> bands<00:01:48.149> when<00:01:48.720> you

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
but um the bans the lash bands when you

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:54.260 
but um the bans the lash bands when you
apply<00:01:49.140> it<00:01:49.170> on<00:01:49.470> it's<00:01:50.369> not<00:01:51.329> as<00:01:51.780> sturdy<00:01:52.170> as<00:01:53.270> the

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
apply it on it's not as sturdy as the

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.340 
apply it on it's not as sturdy as the
Mac<00:01:54.479> lashes<00:01:55.579> and<00:01:56.579> I<00:01:57.210> notice<00:01:57.719> there<00:01:57.930> is<00:01:58.079> already

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
Mac lashes and I notice there is already

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.289 
Mac lashes and I notice there is already
when<00:01:58.680> you<00:01:58.799> peel<00:01:59.009> them<00:01:59.130> off<00:01:59.340> there<00:01:59.640> seems<00:02:00.030> to<00:02:00.180> be

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
when you peel them off there seems to be

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:02.480 
when you peel them off there seems to be
like<00:02:00.630> extra<00:02:01.020> adhesive<00:02:01.320> already<00:02:02.040> on<00:02:02.250> the

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
like extra adhesive already on the

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.020 
like extra adhesive already on the
lashes<00:02:02.960> so<00:02:03.960> like<00:02:04.200> if<00:02:04.350> you're<00:02:04.500> putting<00:02:04.829> zero<00:02:05.369> on

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
lashes so like if you're putting zero on

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:11.120 
lashes so like if you're putting zero on
these<00:02:08.270> it<00:02:09.270> doesn't<00:02:09.569> spread<00:02:10.259> is<00:02:10.560> even

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:11.130 
these it doesn't spread is even

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:14.660 
these it doesn't spread is even
as<00:02:11.340> I<00:02:11.460> thought<00:02:11.670> it<00:02:11.880> would<00:02:12.200> so<00:02:13.200> I<00:02:13.680> guess<00:02:14.460> it's

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
as I thought it would so I guess it's

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:17.540 
as I thought it would so I guess it's
just<00:02:14.730> a<00:02:14.970> matter<00:02:15.000> of<00:02:15.330> preference<00:02:16.220> but<00:02:17.220> again

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550 
just a matter of preference but again

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:21.620 
just a matter of preference but again
I'll<00:02:17.700> show<00:02:17.910> you<00:02:17.970> these<00:02:18.210> are<00:02:18.420> number<00:02:18.860> 99<00:02:20.630> and

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
I'll show you these are number 99 and

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:27.410 
I'll show you these are number 99 and
then<00:02:22.910> this<00:02:23.910> is<00:02:24.120> the<00:02:24.240> number<00:02:24.390> 30<00:02:25.820> which<00:02:26.820> I<00:02:27.150> guess

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
then this is the number 30 which I guess

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:31.430 
then this is the number 30 which I guess
would<00:02:27.630> be<00:02:27.890> kind<00:02:28.890> of<00:02:29.040> close<00:02:29.250> to<00:02:29.820> maybe<00:02:30.690> number<00:02:30.990> 3

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
would be kind of close to maybe number 3

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.470 
would be kind of close to maybe number 3
lashes<00:02:31.950> a<00:02:31.980> little<00:02:32.310> bit<00:02:32.400> bigger<00:02:32.610> from<00:02:33.000> Mac<00:02:33.210> and

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
lashes a little bit bigger from Mac and

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:38.360 
lashes a little bit bigger from Mac and
then<00:02:34.350> these<00:02:34.650> are<00:02:34.950> number<00:02:35.220> 28<00:02:36.950> so<00:02:37.950> we<00:02:38.100> are<00:02:38.190> just

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
then these are number 28 so we are just

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:40.040 
then these are number 28 so we are just
playing<00:02:38.550> around<00:02:38.730> trying<00:02:39.420> different<00:02:39.840> looks

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050 
playing around trying different looks

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:43.760 
playing around trying different looks
these<00:02:40.890> are<00:02:41.100> good<00:02:41.310> to<00:02:41.640> try<00:02:42.180> out<00:02:42.420> for<00:02:43.410> the<00:02:43.560> price

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:43.770 
these are good to try out for the price

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:46.670 
these are good to try out for the price
you<00:02:44.100> really<00:02:44.280> can't<00:02:44.670> beat<00:02:44.910> it<00:02:45.090> I<00:02:45.720> know<00:02:46.350> a<00:02:46.470> lot<00:02:46.650> of

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
you really can't beat it I know a lot of

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.860 
you really can't beat it I know a lot of
people<00:02:47.070> use<00:02:47.220> the<00:02:47.460> ardell<00:02:47.820> lashes<00:02:47.850> and<00:02:48.690> then

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
people use the ardell lashes and then

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:52.280 
people use the ardell lashes and then
try<00:02:49.230> those<00:02:49.560> yet<00:02:49.950> so<00:02:50.660> I'm<00:02:51.660> just<00:02:51.840> gonna<00:02:51.990> keep

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
try those yet so I'm just gonna keep
