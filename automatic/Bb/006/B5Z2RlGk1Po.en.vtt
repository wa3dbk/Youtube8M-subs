00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:55.640 
a Jedi consular night a smuggler and I
and<00:04:53.910> a<00:04:53.940> trooper<00:04:54.810> go<00:04:54.930> through<00:04:55.140> but<00:04:55.290> the<00:04:55.410> trooper

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:55.650 
and a trooper go through but the trooper

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:56.930 
and a trooper go through but the trooper
wins<00:04:55.800> first<00:04:56.010> rolled<00:04:56.190> and<00:04:56.310> the<00:04:56.370> Jedi<00:04:56.520> does<00:04:56.760> and

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:56.940 
wins first rolled and the Jedi does and

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:59.060 
wins first rolled and the Jedi does and
so<00:04:57.030> it<00:04:57.180> could<00:04:57.330> make<00:04:57.450> keep<00:04:58.260> people<00:04:58.560> from<00:04:58.680> moving

00:04:59.060 --> 00:04:59.070
