00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:07.759
 So 3 Well basic place called on the d window will place the object 

00:00:06.439 --> 00:00:14.240
 Let's start from 

00:00:07.759 --> 00:00:15.320
 a First of all, put an object on this stage, and the key will not be on top. 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:20.700
 Seen state 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:21.090
 Another one is that the child of that numeric keypad is in the state of parallel projection 

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:25.050
 Huh 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:26.250
 It would be better to put that one more ghost pass, but it took a pass 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:30.300
 In the state 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:34.080
 Well, that's because the space looks distorted 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:40.020
 I will put in the state of the parallel projection state of the parallel projection state 

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:41.110
 Place in this place Left click this 3d cursor position will change from this place 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.620
 Where I want to 

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:50.110
 2 Adjust the position of this cursor and 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:54.160
 In the menu you see here there are a lot of object items 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:59.680
 Let's put that very common mesh this time 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:01:01.100
 By referred to as the cube of a I will not leave another one cube mesh Yes This now 1 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:07.159
 Individual cubes on the screen 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:10.940
 Also left cursor when you want to put a new addition that another object in a different location than we are 

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:15.950
 In Ard Position the cursor at the left click 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:16.850
 For example, let's put out a sphere sphere, for example uv sphere 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:22.390
 I will keep it 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:22.390
 A state in which objects are arranged to Fu this referred to in the space of that 3 d now 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:31.740
 In is that I is the buy-in should keep doing cat normally this 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:36.600
 At this time, if you pay attention to this sphere for a moment 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:42.510
 Here is the number of rings this how much child fine that 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:43.659
 And because what put in a disassembled state is not out of the left side technology of the screen 

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:50.109
 Here 

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:52.770
 For example those segments in the future is the 32-ring 16 which is equivalent to that the system fiber linear 

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:57.479
 When segment numbers are reduced 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:58.859
 In this way , the number of divisions is decreasing, so segment 4 is extremely 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:02.850
 It is such a state if you do 

00:01:58.859 --> 00:02:07.140
 If it increases by addition and approaches to smoother salt sudden 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:11.980
 Switch to the state as seen from the the Yes front we see from on this now towards the ring 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:14.700
 If you look at it from the front, the ring will be here this time 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:18.240
 This side of the five of the line 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:26.310
 It will be called a ring to adjust the fineness 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:28.710
 In this adjustment panel we are that Corde to the left side and the other yes and move the object 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:34.230
 That will not be displayed 

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:36.210
 It's just after putting it, for example, how much division would you like to display in a sphere 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:38.260
 Immediately after putting something like that 

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:44.709
 Come out on the left side of this screen 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:47.980
 It will appear in the tool panel is that it can be adjusted in the settings 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:51.550
 Is a shortcut key after shift but it is a 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:52.020
 Because a menu of shift comes out a menu called at 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:55.020
 Huh 

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:59.280
 It's the same way from here 

00:02:55.020 --> 00:03:03.390
 Choosing a cube, choosing a sphere, or cylinder cylinder 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:09.290
 With corn salt water, it means that such things are left 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:15.620
 These basic objects are first of all when modeling objects 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:16.730
 Because it is common to put that and then go through that editing, first of all this shift 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:22.370
 to in a 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:25.870
 Wind of that operation, which say that we choose what you need from the mesh after de out this panel 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:25.870
 First of all that means
