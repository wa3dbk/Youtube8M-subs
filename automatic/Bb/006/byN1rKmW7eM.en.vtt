00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:41.330 
the downswing coming once you've made
your<00:01:39.990> backswing<00:01:40.530> so<00:01:40.710> both<00:01:40.890> of<00:01:41.009> you<00:01:41.130> both

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
your backswing so both of you both

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.789 
your backswing so both of you both
trying<00:01:41.670> to<00:01:41.700> set<00:01:42.030> onto<00:01:42.360> your<00:01:42.479> left<00:01:42.630> foot<00:01:42.960> but

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
trying to set onto your left foot but

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.620 
trying to set onto your left foot but
then<00:01:43.950> you're<00:01:44.220> done<00:01:44.399> that's<00:01:44.880> it<00:01:45.119> from<00:01:45.390> there

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
then you're done that's it from there

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.389 
then you're done that's it from there
it's<00:01:45.810> just<00:01:45.869> all<00:01:46.110> arms<00:01:46.619> coming<00:01:46.950> in<00:01:47.070> to<00:01:47.159> hit<00:01:47.310> the

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
it's just all arms coming in to hit the

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.730 
it's just all arms coming in to hit the
ball<00:01:47.579> and<00:01:47.790> then<00:01:48.210> the<00:01:48.390> massive<00:01:48.960> hip<00:01:49.229> turn<00:01:49.530> is

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
ball and then the massive hip turn is

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.560 
ball and then the massive hip turn is
much<00:01:49.920> more<00:01:50.070> after<00:01:50.759> the<00:01:50.820> shot<00:01:51.119> so<00:01:51.329> the<00:01:51.450> ball

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
much more after the shot so the ball

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.330 
much more after the shot so the ball
isn't<00:01:51.810> getting<00:01:52.200> any<00:01:52.350> of<00:01:52.560> that<00:01:52.680> juice<00:01:53.009> it's<00:01:53.189> not

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
isn't getting any of that juice it's not

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.760 
isn't getting any of that juice it's not
getting<00:01:53.640> any<00:01:53.790> of<00:01:53.909> that<00:01:54.090> that<00:01:54.299> fire<00:01:55.229> from<00:01:55.590> the

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
getting any of that that fire from the

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.819 
getting any of that that fire from the
hips<00:01:55.979> and<00:01:56.909> by<00:01:57.119> not<00:01:57.329> using<00:01:57.719> your<00:01:57.840> hips<00:01:58.049> in<00:01:58.560> that

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
hips and by not using your hips in that

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:01.399 
hips and by not using your hips in that
rotation<00:01:59.009> way<00:01:59.670> that<00:01:59.850> you<00:01:59.939> need<00:02:00.119> to<00:02:00.450> it<00:02:00.960> doesn't

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
rotation way that you need to it doesn't

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.469 
rotation way that you need to it doesn't
allow<00:02:01.590> you<00:02:01.649> to<00:02:01.799> get<00:02:02.100> your<00:02:02.159> hips<00:02:02.670> separating

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
allow you to get your hips separating

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:06.020 
allow you to get your hips separating
away<00:02:03.810> from<00:02:04.560> your<00:02:04.710> arms<00:02:05.040> to<00:02:05.189> create<00:02:05.579> this<00:02:05.790> lag

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
away from your arms to create this lag

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.310 
away from your arms to create this lag
so<00:02:06.210> what<00:02:06.329> happens<00:02:06.630> is<00:02:06.719> your<00:02:06.869> arms<00:02:07.079> when<00:02:07.200> we're

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
so what happens is your arms when we're

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.350 
so what happens is your arms when we're
starting<00:02:07.560> the<00:02:07.829> downswing<00:02:08.129> you<00:02:08.399> bump<00:02:09.030> across

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
starting the downswing you bump across

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:10.940 
starting the downswing you bump across
and<00:02:09.539> just<00:02:09.720> pull<00:02:09.959> your<00:02:10.110> arms<00:02:10.349> down<00:02:10.470> into<00:02:10.530> us<00:02:10.830> we

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
and just pull your arms down into us we

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.339 
and just pull your arms down into us we
get<00:02:11.039> this<00:02:11.129> early<00:02:12.030> releasing<00:02:12.629> knot<00:02:12.840> and

00:02:13.339 --> 00:02:13.349 
get this early releasing knot and

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:15.410 
get this early releasing knot and
on<00:02:13.590> the<00:02:13.680> downswing<00:02:14.010> so<00:02:14.610> easy<00:02:14.970> drill<00:02:15.330> to

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
on the downswing so easy drill to

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:16.699 
on the downswing so easy drill to
practice<00:02:15.840> just<00:02:16.020> to<00:02:16.110> give<00:02:16.260> you<00:02:16.349> the<00:02:16.380> feel<00:02:16.560> you

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:16.709 
practice just to give you the feel you

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:17.839 
practice just to give you the feel you

00:02:17.839 --> 00:02:17.849 
don't even need to hit balls of this

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:20.180 
don't even need to hit balls of this

feel like you're just opening up your

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:30.530 
feel like you're just opening up your
hips<00:02:28.230> much<00:02:29.220> as<00:02:29.459> you<00:02:29.580> care<00:02:29.790> some<00:02:30.090> written<00:02:30.420> that

hip so you feel your weight go forwards

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:34.160 
hip so you feel your weight go forwards
and<00:02:32.370> then<00:02:32.760> open<00:02:33.270> them<00:02:33.360> up<00:02:33.450> to<00:02:33.510> the<00:02:33.720> target<00:02:34.080> as

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
and then open them up to the target as

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:35.479 
and then open them up to the target as
much<00:02:34.319> as<00:02:34.440> you<00:02:34.500> can<00:02:34.650> it<00:02:34.800> a<00:02:34.860> real<00:02:35.069> stretch<00:02:35.370> you

00:02:35.479 --> 00:02:35.489 
much as you can it a real stretch you

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:37.970 
much as you can it a real stretch you
down<00:02:35.670> your<00:02:35.790> left<00:02:35.940> side<00:02:36.410> but<00:02:37.410> try<00:02:37.620> to<00:02:37.680> leave<00:02:37.830> the

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
down your left side but try to leave the

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:38.990 
down your left side but try to leave the
club<00:02:38.069> up<00:02:38.250> there<00:02:38.430> as<00:02:38.520> you're<00:02:38.640> doing<00:02:38.730> that<00:02:38.819> you

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
club up there as you're doing that you

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.699 
club up there as you're doing that you
see<00:02:39.150> the<00:02:39.239> split<00:02:39.450> hang<00:02:39.660> rule<00:02:39.930> allows<00:02:40.410> me<00:02:40.620> to

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:40.709 
see the split hang rule allows me to

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:42.770 
see the split hang rule allows me to
create<00:02:40.920> this<00:02:41.100> angle<00:02:41.489> just<00:02:41.700> let<00:02:42.269> your<00:02:42.390> hands<00:02:42.540> go

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
create this angle just let your hands go

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:45.110 
create this angle just let your hands go
so<00:02:43.380> you'll<00:02:43.500> feel<00:02:43.650> like<00:02:43.830> the<00:02:43.950> hit<00:02:44.640> is<00:02:44.849> almost

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
so you'll feel like the hit is almost

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.620 
so you'll feel like the hit is almost
much<00:02:45.450> later<00:02:45.870> so<00:02:46.620> you're<00:02:46.709> gonna<00:02:46.800> do<00:02:46.950> that<00:02:47.069> again

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:47.630 
much later so you're gonna do that again

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:50.300 
much later so you're gonna do that again

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440 
angle go and then just try and bleed

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:03.380 
angle go and then just try and bleed
that<00:02:58.680> on<00:02:58.830> to<00:02:59.010> a<00:02:59.069> shot<00:03:01.819> it's<00:03:02.819> all<00:03:02.910> about<00:03:03.090> trying

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 
that on to a shot it's all about trying

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:05.660 
that on to a shot it's all about trying
to<00:03:03.480> build<00:03:03.660> that<00:03:03.840> feeling<00:03:04.620> starting<00:03:05.519> that

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
to build that feeling starting that

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:07.220 
to build that feeling starting that
downswing<00:03:06.090> much<00:03:06.299> more<00:03:06.569> from<00:03:06.810> your<00:03:06.959> lower

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
downswing much more from your lower

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:08.900 
downswing much more from your lower
faster<00:03:07.830> from<00:03:07.980> the<00:03:08.040> ground<00:03:08.310> absolutely

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:08.910 
faster from the ground absolutely
