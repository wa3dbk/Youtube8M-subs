 hello how are friends of advice 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.139
 imagen bertha gutiérrez dotcom gives me 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.030
 nice to meet you guys 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:14.219
 I am humberto gutiérrez consultant in 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.440
 strategic public image and reputation 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:18.539
 online and today's video advice is 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.279
 about happy socks these 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.199
 socks that are a lot of 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:23.580
 fashion and is in trend that have the 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:26.099
 characteristic of being extremely 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.599
 striking either by the color either 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:30.150
 by the form either by the structure or 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:32.790
 the patterns are extremely striking and 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:35.400
 there are many doubts about whether you can 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.170
 use with formal attire or you should 

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:39.090
 leave for the informal or in fact neither 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.739
 even use them if you can 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.600
 formally use these 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.699
 eye-catching socks as long as 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.280
 follow the following three recommendations 

00:00:44.699 --> 00:00:49.440
 that I will give you in this video advice 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:51.570
 then these recommendations have 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.910
 what to do with how we are going to use it 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.899
 formal way the first the first 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:59.399
 recommendation goes around your profession 

00:00:56.899 --> 00:01:02.039
 you have to look very well at what 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:04.830
 you dedicate what is the stereotype of your 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:06.600
 profession there are professions that approach 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.730
 more to use these sectors that are 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.900
 much more risky and much more 

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:11.250
 daring 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.170
 I would tell you that as an image consultant 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.030
 public because I'm very good at using 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.980
 accessories that are more risky I 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.600
 can i use the happy socks can i 

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:20.880
 use neck ties I can use 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.010
 handkerchiefs because finally doctor the 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.830
 process of influence from the 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:27.180
 perceptions that others have of 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:28.800
 we then if I dedicate myself to 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.630
 process of influence was what I can 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:32.700
 use very well but there are professions 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:35.010
 that are much stricter more 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.350
 structured more organized and much 

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:39.810
 more serious and sober you have to have a lot 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.970
 Be careful with that according to the recommendation 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:44.100
 the second is regardless of your 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:46.560
 profession you have to consider the 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.810
 context to what people are you going to see in the 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.520
 day I always tell people that 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:52.560
 Directly advised a new world 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.940
 I tell them before dressing or before 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.010
 to choose the clothes that they will use in 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:57.840
 the day consider the number of people 

00:01:56.010 --> 00:02:00.030
 to which they will see and the kind of 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.350
 people who are going to see you said 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.670
 that a consultant in the image can 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.880
 use the chapters without major 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.799
 problem yes but 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:09.619
 suddenly I have advice with 

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:11.870
 high level executives that 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:13.160
 they are in have a high rank or that 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:15.260
 I have some politicians who also 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:17.239
 they have a high hierarchical level and believe me 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:19.310
 I do not use the happy shocks on is that in 

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:20.989
 that sense when I can use them 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:22.580
 because a few months ago for example I had the 

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:24.500
 opportunity to share a 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:26.959
 conference to a dedicated university 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:28.880
 specifically to fashion and then 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:30.860
 Of course, if I can use the 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:32.750
 chapters and in addition a handkerchief and in addition 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:34.550
 colors and more if you can use 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:37.310
 but then the second recommendation 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:40.190
 it's always to consider who I'm going to see 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:42.140
 what is the context of the people and the 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:44.269
 third recommendation goes around the 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:46.250
 combination told you they are expensive and 

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:48.080
 has extremely striking are going to call 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:50.569
 attention and they will steal a lot the focus 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:52.730
 of your current therefore you have to 

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:55.030
 consider that the best recommendation is 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:57.140
 dress the happy shops in chromatic range 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:59.720
 what is this chromatic range 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:01.970
 Well, look if you notice right now 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:05.000
 socks that are pink with 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:07.310
 certain little blue dots if you notice 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.480
 they are socks that are very 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:09.709
 striking 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:12.200
 they have a certain color 

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:13.459
 they have two colors the pink and the blue 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:15.920
 Marine 

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:17.989
 then since you have it and look very 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:20.930
 well in the shirt that I bring I bring a 

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:22.489
 shirt that is pink is a hue 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:25.640
 different but it is the same color range 

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:27.680
 of the socks is also pink I bring 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:29.420
 a tie that shares the points or 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:31.250
 the tops that are very fashionable that are 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:32.420
 using a lot now that also 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:34.670
 bring the socks also bring 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:36.680
 little dots nothing but they are white and if 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:39.349
 you notice the handkerchief is a handkerchief 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:41.450
 rose that also has certain details 

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:43.430
 own several ones out there also in 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:47.090
 blue then I am using 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:50.000
 only three colors pink blue and 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:52.069
 white used blue pink and white in 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.319
 harmony is the recommendation that would make you 

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:57.410
 this the happy shots in chromatic range 

00:03:54.319 --> 00:04:00.530
 because if you put pink down green 

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:02.150
 red or blue purple above some 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:03.890
 way you will appear in safe not 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:05.390
 what is the combination of what is 

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:07.250
 this you do not have to be very careful 

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:10.030
 with the combination because it's already very 

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:11.950
 striking the fact of having them here floors 

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:15.459
 in such striking colors then 

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:17.170
 you have to say chromatic range and 

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:18.910
