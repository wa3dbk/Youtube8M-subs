00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:23.300 
the bottom right of the map we have the

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:25.870 
the bottom right of the map we have the
bunker<00:03:23.630> Felucia<00:03:23.960> phone<00:03:24.260> straight<00:03:24.950> up<00:03:24.980> exactly

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:25.880 
bunker Felucia phone straight up exactly

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:27.490 
bunker Felucia phone straight up exactly
what<00:03:26.030> he<00:03:26.090> we<00:03:26.210> would<00:03:26.510> expect<00:03:26.780> from<00:03:26.930> him<00:03:27.050> except

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:27.500 
what he we would expect from him except

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:29.110 
what he we would expect from him except
for<00:03:27.590> the<00:03:27.800> fact<00:03:27.980> that<00:03:28.130> he<00:03:28.340> suddenly<00:03:28.700> starts

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:29.120 
for the fact that he suddenly starts

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:31.830 
for the fact that he suddenly starts
with<00:03:29.240> the<00:03:29.330> double<00:03:29.690> command<00:03:29.990> center<00:03:30.260> here<00:03:30.470> so

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:31.840 
with the double command center here so

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:34.210 
with the double command center here so
very<00:03:32.840> different<00:03:33.110> from<00:03:33.500> what<00:03:33.590> he<00:03:33.830> played

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:34.220

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:52.280 
one a gateway into expand so at this

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:54.970 
one a gateway into expand so at this
point<00:03:52.550> just<00:03:52.940> going<00:03:53.360> for<00:03:53.630> a<00:03:53.960> pretty<00:03:54.500> standard

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:54.980

opening here and see not getting any
scouting<00:03:57.770> information<00:03:58.400> as<00:03:58.520> something<00:03:58.880> that

00:03:58.900 --> 00:03:58.910 
scouting information as something that

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:00.220 
scouting information as something that
we<00:03:59.030> pointed<00:03:59.330> out<00:03:59.480> earlier<00:03:59.660> therefore<00:04:00.170> he

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:00.230 
we pointed out earlier therefore he

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:01.690 
we pointed out earlier therefore he
doesn't<00:04:00.560> know<00:04:00.710> what's<00:04:00.950> going<00:04:01.010> on<00:04:01.250> but<00:04:01.370> you<00:04:01.460> saw

doesn't know what's going on but you saw
the<00:04:01.730> bunker<00:04:02.210> so<00:04:02.360> at<00:04:02.540> least<00:04:02.720> assumes<00:04:03.110> well

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:03.350 
the bunker so at least assumes well

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:05.860 
the bunker so at least assumes well
you're<00:04:03.830> going<00:04:04.070> into<00:04:04.370> an<00:04:04.520> expansion<00:04:05.030> but<00:04:05.750> this

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:05.870 
you're going into an expansion but this

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:08.170 
you're going into an expansion but this
is<00:04:06.170> heading<00:04:06.560> into<00:04:06.740> a<00:04:06.980> more<00:04:07.640> of<00:04:07.700> a<00:04:07.760> late<00:04:07.940> game

is heading into a more of a late game
scenario<00:04:08.660> yeah<00:04:09.290> now<00:04:09.740> the<00:04:09.800> double<00:04:10.220> gas<00:04:10.370> going

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:10.760 
scenario yeah now the double gas going

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:13.180 
scenario yeah now the double gas going
down<00:04:10.910> one<00:04:11.690> who<00:04:11.900> added<00:04:12.410> the<00:04:12.440> two<00:04:12.800> additional

barracks and the same is true for MC MC
now<00:04:16.070> with<00:04:16.220> a<00:04:16.250> double<00:04:16.580> gateway<00:04:16.910> but<00:04:17.180> still<00:04:17.420> he

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:17.660 
now with a double gateway but still he

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:19.240 
now with a double gateway but still he
is<00:04:17.690> of<00:04:18.080> course<00:04:18.290> it<00:04:18.470> will<00:04:18.590> be<00:04:18.650> behind<00:04:18.920> in<00:04:19.190> the

he sees Emilio I know it's coming now if
he<00:05:11.780> sees<00:05:11.960> his<00:05:12.110> probe<00:05:12.380> with<00:05:12.560> his<00:05:12.680> Marines<00:05:12.920> he'll

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:13.130 
he sees his probe with his Marines he'll

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:14.980 
he sees his probe with his Marines he'll
actually<00:05:13.310> be<00:05:13.580> able<00:05:13.820> to<00:05:14.060> know<00:05:14.420> exactly<00:05:14.450> calling

which<00:05:18.980> is<00:05:19.100> pretty<00:05:19.250> smart<00:05:19.520> but<00:05:19.670> he's<00:05:19.790> going<00:05:19.880> to

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:19.940 
which is pretty smart but he's going to

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:22.120 
which is pretty smart but he's going to
need<00:05:20.080> he's<00:05:21.080> gonna<00:05:21.350> need<00:05:21.440> a<00:05:21.530> little<00:05:21.770> bit<00:05:21.890> more

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:25.870 
yeah I feel like needs to make like
three<00:05:23.930> bunkers<00:05:24.440> right<00:05:24.800> now<00:05:24.950> I<00:05:25.370> don't<00:05:25.520> think<00:05:25.670> he

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:25.880 
three bunkers right now I don't think he

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:27.220 
three bunkers right now I don't think he
realizes<00:05:26.150> the<00:05:26.420> seriousness<00:05:26.660> of<00:05:27.110> the

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:27.230 
realizes the seriousness of the

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:29.230 
realizes the seriousness of the
situation<00:05:27.260> he<00:05:27.800> saw<00:05:27.950> the<00:05:28.010> probe<00:05:28.370> but<00:05:28.580> he's

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:29.240 
situation he saw the probe but he's

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:30.670 
situation he saw the probe but he's
probably<00:05:29.330> thinking<00:05:29.510> oh<00:05:29.750> yeah<00:05:30.110> just<00:05:30.260> some<00:05:30.440> poor

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:30.680 
probably thinking oh yeah just some poor

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:32.680 
probably thinking oh yeah just some poor
gateway<00:05:31.010> pressure<00:05:31.310> it's<00:05:31.670> five<00:05:32.000> though<00:05:32.330> it's

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:32.690 
gateway pressure it's five though it's

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:34.960 
gateway pressure it's five though it's
yeah<00:05:33.230> I'll<00:05:33.500> be<00:05:33.590> fast<00:05:33.800> I<00:05:34.100> also<00:05:34.310> feel<00:05:34.700> like<00:05:34.730> he's

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:34.970 
yeah I'll be fast I also feel like he's

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:36.760 
yeah I'll be fast I also feel like he's
massaging<00:05:35.390> this<00:05:35.750> little<00:05:36.080> bit<00:05:36.230> he's<00:05:36.380> trying<00:05:36.650> to

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:36.770 
massaging this little bit he's trying to

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:38.770 
massaging this little bit he's trying to
get<00:05:36.890> more<00:05:37.010> orders<00:05:37.250> are<00:05:37.520> to<00:05:37.550> and<00:05:38.030> his<00:05:38.510> problem

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:38.780 
get more orders are to and his problem

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:41.350 
get more orders are to and his problem
is<00:05:39.050> that<00:05:39.080> stem<00:05:39.530> is<00:05:39.740> nowhere<00:05:40.370> near<00:05:40.820> to<00:05:41.090> be<00:05:41.150> done

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:41.360 
is that stem is nowhere near to be done

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:43.570 
is that stem is nowhere near to be done
so<00:05:41.870> that<00:05:41.900> will<00:05:42.200> take<00:05:42.440> a<00:05:42.470> long<00:05:42.770> time<00:05:42.830> the<00:05:43.100> bunker

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:43.580 
so that will take a long time the bunker

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:46.450 
so that will take a long time the bunker
the<00:05:43.940> ground<00:05:44.210> will<00:05:44.390> definitely<00:05:45.190> get<00:05:46.190> a<00:05:46.250> good

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:46.460 
the ground will definitely get a good

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:48.159 
the ground will definitely get a good
shot<00:05:46.490> at<00:05:46.669> the<00:05:46.880> rocks<00:05:47.120> and<00:05:47.390> he<00:05:47.630> sees<00:05:47.990> that

00:05:48.159 --> 00:05:48.169 
shot at the rocks and he sees that

00:05:48.169 --> 00:05:49.480 
shot at the rocks and he sees that
there's<00:05:48.350> a<00:05:48.410> lot<00:05:48.620> of<00:05:48.650> damage<00:05:48.919> going<00:05:49.220> on<00:05:49.340> there

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:49.490
