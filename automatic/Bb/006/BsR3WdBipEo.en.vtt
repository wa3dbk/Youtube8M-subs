00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.529
 made thousands of photos of the surface of the 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:10.050
 Mars planet of all images 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:11.880
 captured by the space probe to which 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:13.799
 caused more controversy among 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:17.160
 engineers and scientists from the 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:20.640
 whole world was this chocolates cultivation 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.779
 of the soil of a strange image 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.750
 Is not it 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:27.240
 for some with a human face for others 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.130
 with the face of Christ and a group of 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.320
 scholars even admitted that 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.120
 it was merely a delusion of 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.980
 optical 

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:36.809
 but this weekend the English magazine 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.980
 mini skirt text makes a revelation 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:40.500
 incredible 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:43.530
 the Martian face photographed by the rig 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.989
 bikini 1 is not an optical illusion he 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:50.039
 exists and is part of the 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:53.489
 marketing the face say the scientists 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:55.440
 ned 3 miles wide and the eyes 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:58.199
 are 100 meters deeper than the 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.300
 nose the researchers have a question 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:02.070
 they do not know that these depressions 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.930
 form the eyes and nose were 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.530
 caused by the accumulation of water in 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:09.330
 times very very far 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:12.090
 the first studies to decipher the 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:14.820
 mysterious face of matt were tents 10 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:17.610
 years ago by astronomers in 7 pietro 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:19.560
 and gregory brown using computers 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.330
 to enlarge the face image 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.250
 they have been able to greatly improve 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:26.369
 sharpness of the photo taken by the probe 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:28.380
 space and now have also been 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:31.020
 computers and helped the researcher 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:33.299
 brand the company's analytics vote to these 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:35.520
 from boston united states to get to 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:38.040
 conclusion that the mysterious other 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.340
 shot is not an optical illusion 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:43.140
 the report of new scientist magazine 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:45.540
 mark eight days that modern probes 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:48.090
 space good power going forward 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:51.600
 make more perfect pictures of the face of 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:53.369
 marketing and in this race for 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.439
 the Soviets went ahead with the 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:56.790
 I taught the space probes 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:59.250
 fireworks 1 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:01.440
 they are preparing the way for a 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.120
 trip to Mars and go 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:05.940
 clarify the mystery about the presence 

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:08.399
 or not of water in the Martian soil 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:10.500
 but the most expected even by the 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:12.330
 researchers are the images that the 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:14.880
 sophisticated probe equipment 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:17.370
 Soviet forces will transmit to the 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:19.920
 with these images they believe the 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:22.740
 mysterious face of Mars and we already know 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:26.510
 it is not an optical illusion can be 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:26.510
 definitely deciphered 

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:41.650
 is
