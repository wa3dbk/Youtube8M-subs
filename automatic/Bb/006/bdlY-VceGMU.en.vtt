00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:50.720
 hello and welcome to another strategy 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:52.520
 being with the round of small 

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:54.380
 interviews we continue concha guitar 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:56.480
 news that will tell us about the nation that 

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:59.060
 will have under his control the kingdom of 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:00.920
 sweden the imposing sweden a country with 

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:02.860
 a huge military capacity and a 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:05.449
 spectacular resilience 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:07.670
 welcome xavi and it 's a pleasure to have you 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:10.130
 here with us with moron good morning 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:12.040
 I'll pass good morning 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:14.840
 well we proceed with the questions 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:16.090
 because the potential that you observe in your 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:18.670
 kingdom 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:21.570
 because being a northern kingdom I see the 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:24.009
 potential in men the cold weather 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:27.039
 northern 

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:31.329
 for me Sweden is a nation of men 

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:33.969
 hard is and so is more oriented to 

00:01:31.329 --> 00:01:36.130
 military ground potential more than in 

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:38.680
 the maritime 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:42.009
 that you can explain to us about your kingdoms 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:44.079
 neighbors my neighbor kingdoms good in 

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:47.670
 the east I have the Muscovites who do not 

00:01:44.079 --> 00:01:51.429
 they are the czarist empire of the Russians so 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:53.530
 scary but it's still a rival or 

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:55.270
 allied to take into account that already 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:58.450
 we'll see in the south 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:02:02.619
 I have as main one let's say enemy to 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:06.069
 poland that despite not being the empire 

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:08.380
 on the rise there are rival to keep in mind 

00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:12.519
 also but especially those that maybe 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:14.890
 more respect or caution I should have is 

00:02:12.519 --> 00:02:19.150
 especially with the Holy Empire with 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:21.700
 germany with austria and further away from 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:26.080
 the seas I also have england that 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:29.360
 in principle it is not a potential rival 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:31.460
 but we never know 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:33.140
 Well, I think that England did not 

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:36.650
 you should worry but good 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:39.110
 we continue feel question will you try 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:40.850
 create a Scandinavian nation and if this 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:43.280
 this is what will be the way to try 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:45.420
 reach that dynastic goal or 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:48.930
 military 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:52.880
 well then in principle if I want to create 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:56.940
 the Scandinavian nation and especially 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:59.550
 I will try to make it as soon as possible as 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:01.920
 I'm going to do it dynastically or militarily 

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:03.870
 misfortune and although I badly weighed myself 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:07.340
 I think he has to resort to force 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:10.319
 of arms at least with Norwegian and 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:13.260
 maybe with denmark we will try 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:16.380
 negotiate everything possible first as how 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:18.840
 ally as a vassal to win the 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:22.819
 influence and if it can be a 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:25.620
 assimilation but I see that with Denmark 

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:26.780
 the Danes are very reluctant and I do not think 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:30.080
 yes 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:30.080
 predispose to it 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:35.840
 will interest Sweden to get colonies in 

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:38.120
 america facing powers like 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:39.530
 england and france or on the contrary 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:42.290
 will try to focus its strategy 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:45.750
 only in europe and face 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:48.270
 countries like moscow already or austria 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:52.069
 well in principle my main objective 

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:55.430
 is to create the Scandinavian kingdom 

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:59.420
 in relation to the colonies if they are yes 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:04:01.639
 I have opportunity or my enemies do not 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:03.379
 they make it very difficult to try to create 

00:04:01.639 --> 00:04:08.150
 colonies especially in the north of 

00:04:03.379 --> 00:04:11.030
 Canada taking advantage of Iceland as a base 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:13.010
 maritime for possible 

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:15.349
 colonization is but I already say in 

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:18.410
 principle above all will be the kingdom of 

00:04:15.349 --> 00:04:20.780
 scandinavia defend me in case of 

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:25.160
 attacks by Muscovites or those of 

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:28.039
 those of the Poles and curb the possible 

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:30.949
 expansionist ambitions of the sacrum 

00:04:28.039 --> 00:04:33.199
 empire to the north and to end 

00:04:30.949 --> 00:04:35.870
 the multiplayer game will have between 100 

00:04:33.199 --> 00:04:37.699
 and 150 years as you think it 

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:41.760
 will develop your nation during this 

00:04:37.699 --> 00:04:44.730
 time lapse as you think it will end 

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:48.150
 Well, my main objective is to create 

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:52.050
 a strong sweden an advanced spice 

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:55.320
 technologically and above all supported 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:57.600
 by a strong army then how do you 

00:04:55.320 --> 00:05:00.390
 will develop 

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:02.490
 that the gods will say but above all 

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:05.360
 I will try to create as I said the nation 

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:08.030
 Scandinavian improve it technologically 

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:10.140
 not discovered a little the army 

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:12.810
 maintain good relations with my 

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:16.380
 neighbors and if there is no other choice between 

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:18.210
 the fighting I just hope that your kind 

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:21.600
 survive 

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:23.849
 to the European push and that endure for 

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:26.249
 many years 

00:05:23.849 --> 00:05:27.990
 well this is all here you have 

00:05:26.249 --> 00:05:30.659
 I could hear a confident Sweden 

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:32.129
 same with well-marked objectives and 

00:05:30.659 --> 00:05:34.409
 without any fear when 

00:05:32.129 --> 00:05:36.300
 reveal your plans the truth is that it is 

00:05:34.409 --> 00:05:38.159
 a nation to take into account in the 

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:40.110
 development of the game for those 

00:05:38.159 --> 00:05:42.449
 Central and Northern European countries 

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:45.330
