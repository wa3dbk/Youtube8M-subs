00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:22.290
 all right 

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:29.620
 and they scare me I prefer more speed and 

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:32.350
 trace curves and the mountain 

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:34.480
 try a curve you need to know the 

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:36.640
 curve first of all if you do not know 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:38.290
 stay focused 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:40.480
 you have to give more or less 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:42.520
 your position you have to know a little 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:45.540
 the curve maybe also for 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:45.540
 take it a little touch 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:49.289
 Y 

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:59.510
 although the south 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:16.479
 fit a line through the curve 

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:16.479
 for to lose less speed 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.970
 Y 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:44.870
 never had never gone in a car 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:47.720
 in a port like that with curves so closed 

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:50.080
 so fast with some first such 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:50.080
 knock 

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:13.960
 one last a very new experience and 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:15.970
 that I will never forget because he has 

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:19.090
 been water 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:22.180
 macho with therefore hard with 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:24.840
 completely from front 36 try cell with 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:29.280
 so much head and control in the car and 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:29.280
 quiet and amazing
