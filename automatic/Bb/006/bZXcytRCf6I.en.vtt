00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:20.560
 get there quickly the wait is over now 

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:23.730
 we take you the new pizza three floors 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:23.730
 by 795 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:59.199
 yes 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:08.890
 is it please everyone 

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:20.530
 for sale 

00:02:07.319 --> 00:02:11.940
 in my house 

00:02:15.799 --> 00:02:19.879
 the eyes 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:30.120
 the station 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:36.240
 plus 

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:36.240
 m 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:02.959
 the fountain 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:09.180
 ah 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:26.980
 Thus 

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:38.230
 if important maybe not with the best 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:40.780
 match but but if victory does not 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:43.360
 that part of the goal accomplished because 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:45.400
 we beat them and we passed them on 

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:47.680
 classification 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:50.379
 because that is important and moral and maybe 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:52.750
 Then, enjoying the victory 

00:03:50.379 --> 00:03:53.980
 but but not entirely happy with 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:56.140
 the match that we have made I do not think that 

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:58.569
 it does not take us to find the game 

00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:01.090
 ours has cost us a lot if it is 

00:03:58.569 --> 00:04:03.430
 truth that is the feeling that in 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:04.780
 any move we could 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:06.970
 let's throw two or three passes we could 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:08.280
 hurt but it cost us a lot maybe 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:10.329
 the first time we tried 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:12.459
 excessively inside when 

00:04:10.329 --> 00:04:15.730
 outside, it was better and we have 

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:17.199
 accepted but good happy for second 

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:19.780
 time then better they already believe that 

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:21.729
 they are tired and tired of 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:24.430
 they maybe we have been more 

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:26.139
 comfortable with the 20 no longer but good 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:29.020
 happy for the happy victory for 

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:32.289
 move to seventh place and now try 

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:34.600
 tie up be the name level 

00:04:32.289 --> 00:04:37.060
 happy statistic because we have not been 

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:40.240
 We have scored two goals 

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:41.949
 hitting chances we've kept 

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:43.240
 the goal to zero at that happy level 

00:04:41.949 --> 00:04:45.130
 us and mills whenever you leave 

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:47.040
 fulfilling that will mean that we will go 

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:48.630
 adding no but it's true that 

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:52.560
 It's good that you have to look for a 

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:54.270
 little bit more and the game has not been 

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:56.100
 maybe too good but happy not 

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:57.780
 healthy for that reason not to be happy but it is 

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:59.760
 really good that we will work 

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:02.310
 to try to improve the game that we have 

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:03.570
 offered today would be good as another field 

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:05.190
 complicated 

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:07.890
 it's a bit on the same line as 

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:11.130
 we comment not out of home parties 

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:12.690
 different fields and complicated party 

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:15.710
 but it 's true that well let's go we go with 

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:19.170
 a very good streak and wanting to 

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:20.550
 keep adding up I do not think we've 

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:22.800
 past the seventh place but it is 

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:25.320
 important to tie himself to him and every time 

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:27.090
 generate more more space of points with 

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:28.860
 the teams back if the truth is that 

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:31.260
 we have had a good run since 

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:33.690
 time since the barÃ§a match that 

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:35.720
 we started scoring have been split 

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:38.670
 important and we have scratched points of 

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:40.290
 split game and taking each 

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:42.120
 party with the tranquility that 

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:45.420
 requires and with the importance that it has 

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:47.580
 man there has been truly video 

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:49.110
 complicated matches in which if you do not 

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:51.020
 they have fit but 

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:53.580
 and I think the defense is very good 

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:55.290
 we are very strong in defense and now 

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:56.910
 with the icar already in tip with all the 

00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:58.890
 players who are part of 

00:05:56.910 --> 00:06:00.210
 we're pretty good and we're going 

00:05:58.890 --> 00:06:01.560
 getting what we wanted that was 

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:02.910
 score and be where we need to be 

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:05.760
 well I say that it is more or less 

00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:07.620
 travel by plane but if those fields 

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:09.870
 from outside all are artificial are very 

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:11.400
 complicated and in Seville also in there 

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:13.770
 And besides, I think that here, great 

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:15.210
 the arts with points and nothing we go with the 

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:18.980
 illusion and with the desire to do well 

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:18.980
 and be able to bring the three points home
