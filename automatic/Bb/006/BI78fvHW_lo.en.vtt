00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:08.380
 this time I want to talk about two 

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:10.430
 Chords are often used in many 

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:13.930
 songs 

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:13.930
 it is this form of sun 

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:17.910
 and this form of 2 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:28.640
 if you look at this sun we are 

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:28.640
 adding with finger 3 the note network 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:36.040
 an older sun in a normal way that 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:39.720
 it would be like that simply 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:39.720
 but in this way we are doing this 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:45.750
 what gives it a different hue in the 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:48.950
 sound 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.950
 now I'm going to better finger me 

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:59.570
 really here what we are doing 

00:00:55.249 --> 00:01:02.900
 is taking the tonic and the third of a 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:05.830
 C major chord 

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:08.500
 that we are substituting 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:13.020
 the number one finger that is treading on the 2 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:13.020
 on the second string by 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:16.690
 leaving this network that is in the second 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:19.990
 rope 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:22.750
 that would be the ninth of the chord 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:25.090
 for now here we would have 12 and we have 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:28.650
 added the ninth if we encrypt this 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:31.320
 chord is called 29 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:34.220
 substitute chord that we'll see in 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.220
 future elections 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:42.010
 and by adding the note sun for the only thing 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:42.010
 what we are adding is 

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:50.230
 the fifth of the corde two we are 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:52.200
 touching the third string you put the 

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:55.530
 function 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:59.420
 when stepping on the sun note and on the network note 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.420
 when we make both the sun and two 

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:05.050
 Well, the functions 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:12.080
 play the same note we played when 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:14.810
 we press the fourth string and the third 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:16.180
 string to the air would be something like having 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:19.299
 a guitar 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:22.959
 with less strings because we are 

00:02:19.299 --> 00:02:26.319
 clicking here look at the sun your third 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:28.250
 greater than it would be if after we 

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:30.090
 touching upside down 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:34.310
 of the sun 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:34.310
 the king and the sun 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:39.310
 it's as if we had four strings 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:39.310
 it really is worth 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:47.000
 then it was a very nice sound and 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:50.670
 at the same time very modern 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:53.250
 there are songs where these appear 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:55.350
 chords a lot of songs one that 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:59.660
 moderately right now is the song 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:59.660
 more than words from the stream group 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:09.200
 and then they use it in some 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:09.200
 country or folk songs 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:21.540
 to finish this life election them 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:24.050
 I want to teach a trick when we're 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:26.200
 in the form of 2 

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:29.020
 i 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:31.000
 if we raise finger 3 a string and 

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:33.300
 click on the third 3 of the fourth 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.300
 rope 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:40.140
 we generate a sound that sounds very 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:40.140
 Look country 

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:49.640
 all right 

00:03:53.569 --> 00:04:00.970
 good to experience a little bit with them 

00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:00.970
 I hope to see you soon until the view
