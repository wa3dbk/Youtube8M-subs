well there's a 50% chance it's there and

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.810 
well there's a 50% chance it's there and
a<00:00:45.960> 50%<00:00:46.289> chance<00:00:46.649> it's<00:00:47.010> over<00:00:47.309> there

interpretation says well there's

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.229 
interpretation says well there's
actually<00:00:52.350> two<00:00:52.559> universes<00:00:53.280> and<00:00:53.520> in<00:00:54.030> one

another universe it is over there it's

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:00.740 
another universe it is over there it's
kind<00:00:59.219> of<00:00:59.250> a<00:00:59.340> crazy<00:00:59.609> sounding<00:01:00.120> idea<00:01:00.449> but<00:01:00.719> a

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
kind of a crazy sounding idea but a

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.349 
kind of a crazy sounding idea but a
quantum<00:01:01.079> computer<00:01:01.670> perhaps<00:01:02.670> can<00:01:03.059> harness

quantum computer perhaps can harness

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:06.170 
quantum computer perhaps can harness
that<00:01:03.690> by<00:01:04.350> doing<00:01:04.710> some<00:01:05.040> calculations<00:01:05.369> over

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
quantum mechanics now you're harnessing

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.100 
quantum mechanics now you're harnessing
all<00:01:26.070> of<00:01:26.280> these<00:01:26.430> different<00:01:27.360> worlds<00:01:27.810> if<00:01:27.930> you

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
all of these different worlds if you

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:28.580 
all of these different worlds if you
will

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
will

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.530 
will
to<00:01:28.890> do<00:01:29.040> all<00:01:29.310> of<00:01:29.490> these<00:01:29.640> calculations<00:01:29.939> in

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
to do all of these calculations in

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.760 
to do all of these calculations in
parallel<00:01:32.030> much<00:01:33.030> faster<00:01:33.540> much<00:01:33.720> more<00:01:34.200> powerful

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
parallel much faster much more powerful

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.710 
parallel much faster much more powerful
doing<00:01:35.070> calculations<00:01:35.759> that<00:01:35.850> in<00:01:36.150> a<00:01:36.479> single

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
doing calculations that in a single

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.399 
doing calculations that in a single
universe<00:01:37.290> would<00:01:37.500> be<00:01:37.680> impossible<00:01:39.079> so<00:01:40.079> this<00:01:40.229> is

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
universe would be impossible so this is

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:43.039 
universe would be impossible so this is
one<00:01:40.680> way<00:01:40.860> of<00:01:40.890> thinking<00:01:41.070> about<00:01:41.579> it<00:01:41.850> and<00:01:42.150> it

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
one way of thinking about it and it

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.920 
one way of thinking about it and it
offers<00:01:43.619> amazing<00:01:44.460> possibilities<00:01:45.329> and<00:01:45.479> we<00:01:45.600> just

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
offers amazing possibilities and we just

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.850 
offers amazing possibilities and we just
need<00:01:46.170> to<00:01:46.200> see<00:01:46.560> how<00:01:47.570> successful<00:01:48.570> we<00:01:49.320> are<00:01:49.530> at

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
need to see how successful we are at

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.490 
need to see how successful we are at
harnessing<00:01:50.549> these<00:01:50.820> ideas<00:01:51.360> to<00:01:51.450> actually<00:01:51.960> put

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
harnessing these ideas to actually put

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.249 
harnessing these ideas to actually put
it<00:01:52.649> into<00:01:52.860> practice<00:01:53.040> and<00:01:53.790> that<00:01:54.450> we<00:01:54.960> don't<00:01:55.140> know

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
it into practice and that we don't know

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.709 
it into practice and that we don't know
yet<00:01:55.530> we'll<00:01:55.920> see<00:01:56.100> going<00:01:56.340> forward<00:01:56.610> but<00:01:57.450> it's<00:01:57.600> an

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
yet we'll see going forward but it's an

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.480 
yet we'll see going forward but it's an
exciting<00:01:58.290> possibility

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
exciting possibility

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.549 
exciting possibility
