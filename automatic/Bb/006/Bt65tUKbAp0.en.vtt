00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:11.850 
and the reason I see say this is because

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:14.610 
and the reason I see say this is because
I've<00:02:12.850> read<00:02:13.360> a<00:02:13.600> whole<00:02:13.750> bunch<00:02:13.960> of<00:02:14.020> articles<00:02:14.320> of

harder<00:02:14.860> to<00:02:14.920> do<00:02:15.040> it<00:02:15.130> because<00:02:15.280> I<00:02:15.370> couldn't<00:02:15.580> get

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:15.820 
harder to do it because I couldn't get

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:18.990 
harder to do it because I couldn't get
into<00:02:16.150> my<00:02:16.330> roommates<00:02:17.080> lobby<00:02:17.290> and<00:02:17.820> we<00:02:18.820> couldn't
