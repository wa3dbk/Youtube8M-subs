00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
Megan and we come on there are

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:52.459 
Megan and we come on there are
instructions<00:00:51.480> are<00:00:51.809> different<00:00:51.899> so<00:00:52.199> they<00:00:52.320> go

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
instructions are different so they go

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:55.430 
instructions are different so they go
because<00:00:52.710> first<00:00:53.489> you<00:00:53.579> build<00:00:53.699> that<00:00:53.969> then<00:00:54.870> that

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
because first you build that then that

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.069 
because first you build that then that
white<00:00:55.920> piece<00:00:56.219> under<00:00:56.579> there<00:00:56.789> is<00:00:57.120> that<00:00:57.719> built

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
white piece under there is that built

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.130 
white piece under there is that built
but<00:00:58.350> it<00:00:58.440> is<00:00:58.649> kind<00:00:58.920> of<00:00:59.010> cool<00:00:59.510> it's<00:01:00.510> sort<00:01:01.020> of

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
but it is kind of cool it's sort of

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.500 
but it is kind of cool it's sort of
easier<00:01:01.590> to<00:01:01.770> do<00:01:01.890> it<00:01:02.070> sort<00:01:02.850> of<00:01:03.090> leave<00:01:03.210> it<00:01:03.359> a

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
easier to do it sort of leave it a

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.380 
easier to do it sort of leave it a
little<00:01:03.809> Legos<00:01:04.769> still<00:01:05.070> got<00:01:05.220> the<00:01:05.339> edge<00:01:05.460> not<00:01:06.270> as

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
this is the instruction my nose you can

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:23.480 
this is the instruction my nose you can
see<00:01:22.200> built<00:01:22.530> the<00:01:22.650> time<00:01:22.860> then<00:01:23.040> you<00:01:23.070> just<00:01:23.310> pause

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
see built the time then you just pause

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.440 
see built the time then you just pause
it<00:01:24.320> now<00:01:25.490> stickers<00:01:26.490> doesn't<00:01:27.060> tell<00:01:27.210> you<00:01:27.299> how<00:01:27.330> to
