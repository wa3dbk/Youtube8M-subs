00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.020
 this riot of technology the setting 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.440
 manual of the bubble is a little pale 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.660
 figure 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:59.280

 can admire the landscape very very nice 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.050
 but the only thing is that 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:22.810
 being small I have a little trouble 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:25.060
 ascended to go down but once I 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:26.470
 am on it's great a simple

 brilliantly the cycle part is 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:41.530
 irreproachable and the engine despite 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.970
 a few jerks at low revs 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:44.920
 as spectacular as it is effective 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:46.540
 only shadow on the board a box 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:48.400
 Perfectible speeds punctuated with fake 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:50.230
 dead point a drop of water in a 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:51.550
 ocean of quality for a machine whose 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:53.760
 it's hard not to fall
