00:00:00.609 --> 00:00:04.310
 Dr in the second half of the residents twenty-fifth is twice he had to 

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:07.670
 now be relocated and played today the SV Bernbach 

00:00:08.659 --> 00:00:13.119
 Table second to five tenths Picture of the table against the SG Porsche pulled 

00:00:13.119 --> 00:00:16.049
 actually a clear thing 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:19.550
 maybe they both know there is a creek is currently Norbert Nachtweih 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:23.429
 As a coach, the former Eintracht player of the Bayern players is obliged 

00:00:23.429 --> 00:00:26.560
 first coach Torben maybe he can do even more 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:29.560
 make flutes go even further 

00:00:30.319 --> 00:00:33.319
 furthermore Florian Masters 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:37.850
 who the way to far because already took place because he stayed in the main-kinzig circle 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:41.120
 there Norbert Nachtweih made his first serious appearance as new 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:44.260
 Coach at the SV Bernbach away from the big football stage or be 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.110
 which then hopefully not be angry 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.720
 go to the province maybe Norbert Nachtweih has more attractive around Eva 

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:53.170
 cup-winner German championships dfb-cup win all this for the 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:57.260
 Eintracht and FC Bayern now fourth-rate despite everything the whole 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.460
 sexy for him 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.040
 athletic heirs sometimes without worrying him whole or a game for everyone 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:04.799
 Percentage points coach 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:06.880
 both train Aubry's team 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:09.470
 the Krienser team does not continue the table unless you can 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:12.890
 Do not think where the goals would have to be, where do you sit yourself 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:17.550
 earlier was under the wheels by quite clear rise in the regional league 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:22.440
 about one percent are of course also their who new Muttenz achieved that is 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:23.630
 certainly not very clear 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:26.900
 but my athletic goal is of course percent on fast direct 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:28.820
 Promotion to the Regionalliga 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:32.490
 and he has every reason Bernbach with Georg Marckmann on the ball as the only one 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.240
 Oberliga team so far without defeat in this derby against Bad 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:37.810
 Soden lament mostly cheerful but partly the victory 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:41.170
 a very weak idea the first option after almost thirty minutes 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:45.220
 for the hosts Bad Soden also a bit powerful but 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:49.780
 after all, very dedicated a point win the wishful dream of coach for the 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:52.760
 gardener 

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:56.090
 but countable came in the first section 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:58.960
 even if they do not expect such a turnaround 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:02.650
 the visit and the week still a little less than expected 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:05.910
 the sports facility made in a painstaking detail playful the 

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:10.700
 Kicker reported place, however, was not a hitherto weak previous day bath 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:12.699
 Soden cross from Hong Kong put 

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:13.940
 safe in the defense 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:17.229
 and no compactness at all 

00:02:17.229 --> 00:02:21.599
 Hollande graduating way too weak on the deep lawn in Bärnbach at break 

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:24.590
 Norbert Nachtweih could not be satisfied only 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:27.049
 now located 

00:02:27.049 --> 00:02:30.270
 but the second section in this game then much better 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:32.089
 the guests played with class 

00:02:32.089 --> 00:02:35.089
 wait for the better chances 

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:38.039
 For the guests 

00:02:38.039 --> 00:02:41.519
 Possibilities now on both sides 

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:44.719
 nice pass in the depths on Torsten Röder 

00:02:44.719 --> 00:02:49.229
 but the failure of Jung were cool there are in force the text 

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:54.099
 15 minutes to play in this game 

00:02:55.189 --> 00:02:59.019
 this hit with good luck model Matthias Karbowski short episode 

00:02:59.019 --> 00:02:59.769
 changed 

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:03.090
 the Basler over the line but ultimately a surprising 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:04.139
 away win 

00:03:04.139 --> 00:03:07.579
 for the SG Bad Soden Arnoud so easy when the first defeat of the season for 

00:03:07.579 --> 00:03:10.249
 Bernbach and failed league play debut is long at the Norbert 

00:03:10.249 --> 00:03:13.509
 ex-profi here was which Bundesliga side formerly played itself
