00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:04.980
 very good to all people I am a machine and 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:07.620
 welcome to a new keyword video 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.300
 this time I start the series of mods 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.920
 of keyword that I wanted to have started already 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:14.219
 long ago and good then in each 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:16.290
 chapter usually brings 12 mods that to me 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:19.500
 they like that they have some utility or they are 

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:22.200
 funny and then nothing to give it to 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.850
 know and if you want you get in 

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:27.270
 this time I bring you something pretty 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:29.640
 funny is a modification of the sound 

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:31.650
 that we have in the game when we go up 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.300
 of level right now I am about to 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.760
 level up as you see up there and 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.080
 come on I'm going to kill a bug and I'm going to 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.740
 let me in the comments tell me 

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:42.130
 what 

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:43.410
 good that you listen to those sounds 

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:45.780
 let's 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:48.720
 because I do not hear anything because you have not 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:51.000
 Level up in false alarm 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:53.390
 Let's start another bug vale vale 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.390
 attentive 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:03.910
 Let's go good because this is the sound that 

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:05.500
 it sounds now in my world when it goes up 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:07.750
 level we can also put other 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:09.549
 sounds for example this is the sound 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:12.600
 typical of when you level up in world 

00:01:09.549 --> 00:01:15.670
 of warcraft and this would be the pokemon 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.140
 red if you are interested in modifying this 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:19.479
 aspect of the game attentive in the 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:21.070
 explanation to the people then in the 

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:23.619
 description I will leave a link to 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:25.270
 mega with this folder you're going to 

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:27.580
 download and it will come out as this 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:29.560
 same as I have here after explaining 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:31.240
 basically how do you install this type 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:34.659
 of modifications is super simple 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:37.929
 the first folder is simply because 

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:41.259
 a program that helps you to be able 

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:43.000
 create your own cube structures 

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:44.649
 word for example that is to build a 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.380
 new delta wing, you can build it 

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:48.850
 from here you are putting the cubes and then 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:51.140
 you build your own hang glider that then 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:53.560
 you put the file in 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:55.970
 in the folder to do with teaching how and 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:57.590
 you would have the model that you have created 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:00.080
 ok this is for if you want it 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:02.570
 start using me because at the moment it has not 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:05.780
 managed to create nothing interesting takes 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:07.610
 its time and good because this is an extra 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:11.510
 that taught here in the folder then 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:13.040
 to be able to put the sound of when 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:15.530
 we level up these folders are the 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:16.910
 what are you interested in let's say this editor 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:17.959
 in fact you can erase it because they are 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:20.090
 things that I have done that does not have 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:22.370
 no good sense because the first one is 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:24.080
 the mods here because you have is in fact 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:29.000
 you can here how are we going to put more bots 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:30.680
 here you can put level music mod 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.310
 for example if you put all these 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:36.520
 folders 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:38.630
 you know that here you are going to have the mode of 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:40.610
 level music how do you put these 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:42.290
 things for simple tell you asset browser 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:44.840
 which is basically the program that we 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:47.180
 will serve to be able to modify 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:51.970
 different files of the game you are looking for 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:51.970
 cube world that has to be in team 

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:59.410
 by 36 if you have 64 bits then over here 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:01.990
 is accept 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:03.490
 and here they are opened the data 1 2 3 and 4 

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:05.440
 first of all you have to make a copy 

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:07.060
 of security of these 4 files 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:09.520
 just in case it is better to prevent than later 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:11.320
 that we fuck the game we do control ce 

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:13.750
 and we paste it where you want example here 

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:16.210
 in 6 I have the save folder I have it 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:17.980
 I saved and here I have up to 12 att 

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:20.440
 this is 4 this is just like two 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:21.700
 urge the game without any modification 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:24.220
 just in case we install some way that 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:26.700
 Quixote is fucked the game then to have 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:29.140
 as always the insecurity file 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:31.480
 ok to make this modification 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:33.880
 specifically we are going to data 2 and here 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:34.600
 below we will find level up the 

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:37.930
 audio file 

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:41.019
 we're just going to eric insert 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:42.939
 here , music mods at the level and we choose 

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:43.930
 the one that we want the one that I had before 

00:03:42.939 --> 00:03:46.299
 I told you to put it on 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:48.909
 comments is the one from Skype that 

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:50.200
 we would simply give it here and it is already 

00:03:48.909 --> 00:03:52.300
 has added 

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:54.190
 is already added here this is the one of 

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:55.569
 skyrim has to keep this 

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:58.090
 name you can not put ska remove 

00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:59.680
 close this we will be missing 12 reid and 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:02.769
 you have to start the qb word from 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:03.870
 google from the exe point cube not from 

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:08.040
 the launcher is worth 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:08.040
 you go to the cube word folder 

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:17.700
 you see there is world launcher and below 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.530
 and so it was up Google launcher and 

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:21.530
 that is simply worth it then you have to 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:25.020
 open this launcher if you open the launcher 

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:26.370
 automatically the mode is destroyed it 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:27.840
 it removes vale you will not have to return to 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:29.160
 put nothing but let's go that for 

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:31.680
 that works, you have to be affected from 

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:33.600
 Cuba and it has nothing else people I hope 

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:35.600
