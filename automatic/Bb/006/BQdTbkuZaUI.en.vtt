thing<00:01:38.790> I<00:01:38.850> do<00:01:38.910> notice<00:01:39.240> with<00:01:39.510> this<00:01:39.630> car<00:01:39.900> is<00:01:40.410> how

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
thing I do notice with this car is how

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.230 
thing I do notice with this car is how
well<00:01:40.950> it<00:01:41.070> works<00:01:41.250> on<00:01:41.460> the<00:01:41.550> track<00:01:41.820> I<00:01:41.970> mean<00:01:42.120> on<00:01:42.210> the

things to say about this 7-speed SMG

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.400 
things to say about this 7-speed SMG
transmission<00:01:48.180> but<00:01:48.660> on<00:01:48.780> the<00:01:48.900> track<00:01:49.110> it<00:01:49.229> works

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:49.410 
transmission but on the track it works

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:51.380 
transmission but on the track it works
really<00:01:49.680> well<00:01:49.830> nice<00:01:50.220> quick<00:01:50.610> crisp<00:01:51.030> the<00:01:51.210> gear

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
really well nice quick crisp the gear

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.740 
really well nice quick crisp the gear
changes<00:01:51.869> works<00:01:52.650> a<00:01:52.770> treat<00:01:53.270> one<00:01:54.270> thing<00:01:54.479> with<00:01:54.630> the

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
changes works a treat one thing with the

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.780 
changes works a treat one thing with the
m5<00:01:55.200> is<00:01:55.229> how<00:01:55.650> well<00:01:55.830> the<00:01:55.979> electronics<00:01:56.520> word

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
m5 is how well the electronics word

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.210 
m5 is how well the electronics word
often<00:01:57.510> with<00:01:57.960> these<00:01:58.110> systems<00:01:58.560> which<00:01:58.800> basically

00:01:59.210 --> 00:01:59.220 
often with these systems which basically

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:01.219 
often with these systems which basically
break<00:01:59.580> a<00:01:59.610> wheel<00:01:59.910> individually<00:02:00.479> to<00:02:00.810> control<00:02:01.200> a

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
break a wheel individually to control a

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.320 
break a wheel individually to control a
slide<00:02:01.619> they'll<00:02:02.280> work<00:02:02.460> against<00:02:02.910> you<00:02:03.000> not<00:02:03.150> with

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:03.330 
slide they'll work against you not with

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:04.730 
slide they'll work against you not with
you<00:02:03.450> but<00:02:03.600> this<00:02:03.720> one's<00:02:03.900> really<00:02:04.170> working<00:02:04.619> with

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
you but this one's really working with

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.469 
you but this one's really working with
me<00:02:04.890> and<00:02:05.070> the<00:02:05.490> good<00:02:05.640> thing<00:02:05.820> is<00:02:05.850> it's<00:02:06.060> got<00:02:06.180> three

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
me and the good thing is it's got three

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:08.090 
me and the good thing is it's got three
settings<00:02:06.840> you<00:02:07.320> can<00:02:07.380> have<00:02:07.650> it<00:02:07.740> on<00:02:07.860> which<00:02:08.070> is

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:08.100 
settings you can have it on which is

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:10.460 
settings you can have it on which is
basically<00:02:08.610> an<00:02:08.820> any<00:02:09.030> type<00:02:09.270> setting<00:02:09.690> you<00:02:10.410> can

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
basically an any type setting you can

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.070 
basically an any type setting you can
have<00:02:10.800> it<00:02:10.920> in<00:02:11.070> a<00:02:11.220> mid<00:02:11.459> Smith's<00:02:12.000> setup<00:02:12.780> which<00:02:12.959> is

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
have it in a mid Smith's setup which is

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:14.840 
have it in a mid Smith's setup which is
what<00:02:13.230> i'm<00:02:13.320> working<00:02:13.500> in<00:02:13.709> now<00:02:13.950> or<00:02:14.490> you<00:02:14.580> can<00:02:14.730> have

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:14.850 
what i'm working in now or you can have

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:17.000 
what i'm working in now or you can have
it<00:02:14.970> completely<00:02:15.360> off<00:02:15.600> now<00:02:16.350> i'm<00:02:16.590> quite<00:02:16.830> happy

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
it completely off now i'm quite happy

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:18.140 
it completely off now i'm quite happy
with<00:02:17.160> the<00:02:17.370> mid<00:02:17.520> setting<00:02:17.790> that<00:02:17.880> I'm<00:02:18.000> in<00:02:18.120> now

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
with the mid setting that I'm in now

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:19.730 
with the mid setting that I'm in now
because<00:02:18.600> of<00:02:18.630> all<00:02:18.810> this<00:02:18.959> rain<00:02:19.260> and<00:02:19.440> because<00:02:19.650> of

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
how slip of the track is so even higher

00:02:43.759 --> 00:02:43.769 
even a carbon fiber roof so the car

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:46.310 
even a carbon fiber roof so the car
feels<00:02:44.480> unbelievably<00:02:45.480> quick<00:02:45.780> obviously<00:02:46.200> with

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:46.320 
feels unbelievably quick obviously with

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:48.500 
feels unbelievably quick obviously with
that<00:02:46.440> v10<00:02:46.860> engine<00:02:47.190> but<00:02:47.820> it's<00:02:47.970> also<00:02:48.150> a<00:02:48.330> lot

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
that v10 engine but it's also a lot

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:50.479 
that v10 engine but it's also a lot
better<00:02:48.690> in<00:02:48.870> the<00:02:48.959> corners<00:02:49.350> it<00:02:49.769> doesn't<00:02:50.130> feel<00:02:50.310> as

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:50.489 
better in the corners it doesn't feel as

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:53.060 
better in the corners it doesn't feel as
heavy<00:02:50.640> as<00:02:50.850> the<00:02:50.970> m5<00:02:51.450> still<00:02:52.410> you've<00:02:52.650> got<00:02:52.799> to<00:02:52.890> work

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:53.070 
heavy as the m5 still you've got to work

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:54.920 
heavy as the m5 still you've got to work
at<00:02:53.310> it<00:02:53.340> I<00:02:53.459> mean<00:02:53.610> this<00:02:53.790> thing<00:02:54.090> really<00:02:54.480> does<00:02:54.630> want

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
at it I mean this thing really does want

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:58.310 
at it I mean this thing really does want

00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:58.320 
to let go if it like that if it wants to

00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:59.960 
to let go if it like that if it wants to
if<00:02:58.890> it<00:02:59.040> wants<00:02:59.190> to<00:02:59.280> get<00:02:59.370> a<00:02:59.400> bit<00:02:59.519> of<00:02:59.549> tail<00:02:59.790> in

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
if it wants to get a bit of tail in

slides that just coming on to the stroke

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:05.390 
slides that just coming on to the stroke
a<00:03:02.880> couple<00:03:03.450> of<00:03:03.690> left-hand<00:03:04.110> corners<00:03:04.530> now<00:03:05.220> with

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
a couple of left-hand corners now with

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.190 
a couple of left-hand corners now with
this<00:03:05.549> engine<00:03:05.820> the<00:03:06.060> so<00:03:06.239> much<00:03:06.390> past<00:03:06.660> they<00:03:06.840> really

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 
this engine the so much past they really

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.199 
this engine the so much past they really
got<00:03:07.320> to<00:03:07.380> be<00:03:07.470> gentle<00:03:07.680> on<00:03:07.890> the<00:03:07.980> throttle<00:03:08.070> as<00:03:08.549> you

00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:09.209 
got to be gentle on the throttle as you

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:10.820 
got to be gentle on the throttle as you
feed<00:03:09.570> on<00:03:09.750> the<00:03:09.900> power<00:03:10.140> coming<00:03:10.500> onto<00:03:10.739> the
