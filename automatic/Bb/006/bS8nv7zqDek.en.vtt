00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:10.840
 ah 

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:18.720
 today in the century of camila I am going to 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:21.200
 give all my tricks my tips 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:24.540
 so they can get a make-up 

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:27.150
 spectacular but above all very easy 

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:29.640
 to make it serve them for the day as 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.810
 for the night and from scratch as they can 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:36.960
 watch 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:36.960
 from washed face that dared 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:42.280
 The first thing I do when I'm like this 

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:45.750
 proudly and daringly face 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:48.010
 washed is to put an antioxidant 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.980
 spectacular that I recommend them the 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:55.440
 vitamin c here is fine in several 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:55.440
 presentations have many brands 

00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:00.950
 I what 

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:03.410
 I leave it 

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:04.730
 that goes well in all the skin that 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:08.450
 we put a little bit also in the neck 

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:11.750
 if you want and then I put my outline 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:15.320
 of eyes then I fill with cream 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:16.880
 moisturizing I went testing I'm testing and 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:20.210
 testing and testing many brands 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:24.010
 but also it changes a brand 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:27.070
 it's not expensive it 's a brand 

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:31.010
 for intolerant skin because my skin 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:34.190
 is intolerant I'm going to apply the base 

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:36.500
 the base that is around here there are several 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:37.910
 types of bases you choose the one 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:40.310
 more like it 

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:43.970
 in my case I like to always choose 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:45.980
 a base that is a little more rise 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:48.980
 of tone of my color of my whiteness 

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:51.110
 extreme natural because it does not look like 

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:54.890
 tan then I always choose a 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:58.000
 based a little racier me 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:02:01.580
 I like to put myself the finger 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.710
 it's a bit bright I do not know if it 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:05.700
 they notice there through the camera I 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:08.990
 I put a little bit like that 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.990
 I'm almost ready 

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:16.460
 the hands are cleaned after this 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:18.950
 Many women love to use powders in my 

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:21.380
 case I do not use powders that's why I give them 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:24.500
 my tips do not use because I think that 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:27.290
 when women spend 35 years and 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:29.660
 we put on powders they notice a little 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:31.220
 more lines of expression aside to me 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:34.520
 as you have noticed I like to see 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:35.750
 wet skin now well when I work 

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:38.030
 on television sometimes I have to use 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:40.130
 powders to not see me very bright in 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:45.380
 that case I recommend the powders 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:47.750
 minerals have it loose or compact 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:51.340
 I recommend you use it I like it better 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:54.730
 to place the powders a 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:57.990
 brochita well well loose well chubby me 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:59.580
 like much more than the speck 

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:01.470
 this makeup that I'm going to do to 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:03.900
 then it serves for the day or for 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:06.530
 The night depends on the intensity of the 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:09.410
 color that I use now I'm going to use white 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:12.600
 now to apply the shadow them 

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:14.310
 I recommend with closed eyes this 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:19.700
 applied 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:19.700
 they get generously in everything logical 

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:26.170
 white good we already have then the 

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:28.480
 shadow in my case I love it and in 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:31.450
 all my makeups up in the most 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:33.280
 simple always passed me a line quote 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:36.100
 blurred in the lower part of the eye 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:37.870
 because my eye is very small I laugh 

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:39.790
 a lot then I'm always very chinita 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:43.030
 sometimes not see me if you want to enlarge 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:45.940
 a little bit more your eye you do this for 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:48.160
 me one of the main things of a 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:50.710
 Makeup is a good mask 

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:53.830
 eyelashes that will leave you eyelashes more 

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:57.580
 longer gorditas always black there 

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:59.710
 some browns and there are others blue but 

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:01.730
 always black to open a lot the 

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:04.690
 eye 

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:07.470
 they go like blinking 

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:11.060
 I do it in several parts 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:15.960
 we go with a very important touch that is 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:18.299
 the little arrows a little above 

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:19.709
 my eyebrows I bought one as my 

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:24.380
 eyebrows are brown and you are clear to me 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:24.380
 I bought a clear brown brush 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:29.639
 and now comes a super magical touch to 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:32.300
 the eye that I love that is 

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:32.300
 grab 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:39.199
 I always do with the same shadow that 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:39.199
 I used the same white shadow above 

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:45.560
 and I'm going to put that umbrella on what 

00:04:43.039 --> 00:04:47.840
 it remains in the lacrimal what we call the 

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:50.990
 lacrimal tear out if 

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:52.940
 you are very haggard in this part of the 

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:55.550
 makeup I recommend in dark circles 

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:57.560
 If you're not so haggard, I recommend a 

00:04:55.550 --> 00:05:00.590
 illuminator also sell them in all 

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:03.789
 the brands at all prices i 

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:03.789
 I use this illuminator 

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:09.540
 then we go with the lips I'm going to 

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:11.670
 show two forms of makeup to 

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:13.980
 lips the first one that I most use the 

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:17.640
 most common and the one I like the most to be 

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:22.560
 honest is a gentle makeup with a 

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:25.130
 pink tone that simulates the color of my 

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:25.130
 lips 

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:31.010
 then the brightness that these glitters sing 

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:37.600
 also bright that have shades 

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:37.600
 bright that are very pink soft and 

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:43.110
 this makeup is very simple very 

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:45.659
 natural and I use it to go for a lunch 

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:48.000
 to a day meeting even for 

00:05:45.659 --> 00:05:51.229
 record when it 's something day but to this 

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:53.129
 makeup lacks the cinnamon touch 

00:05:51.229 --> 00:05:56.370
 notice that as I told you at the beginning 

00:05:53.129 --> 00:05:58.949
 I am not very fond of the powders in 

00:05:56.370 --> 00:06:01.710
 you use or there are other people who 

00:05:58.949 --> 00:06:04.560
 they say blushes to make up my 

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:09.150
 cheeks the product that I use is cream 

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:10.830
 I usually spend with the blog 

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:12.090
 because I'm a little bit exaggerated 

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:14.640
 make the same mistake that I have 

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:16.860
 committed and I want to show you look with 

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:19.920
 this makeup so you can go to 

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:22.170
 a lunch at a work meeting is 

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:24.870
 a simple and practical makeup for 

00:06:22.170 --> 00:06:27.240
 the day with the clear lips the one that I 

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:28.530
 I recommend you remember that for 

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:31.460
 learn to put on makeup what you have to 

00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:31.460
 to do is to try
