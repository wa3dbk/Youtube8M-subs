00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:08.749
 among all about the sj thousand the 

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:11.599
 action cam full hd cheap chinese that 

00:00:08.749 --> 00:00:12.320
 it proved to be excellent in mine 

00:00:11.599 --> 00:00:15.529
 review 

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:21.260
 I wanted to point out that sometimes 

00:00:15.529 --> 00:00:24.830
 especially from the let 's say Chinese 

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:27.980
 could come with this with this 

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:31.789
 keys transparent we say with the acco sd 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:37.059
 diver what goes under water with i 

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:40.249
 wrong commands in fact you see that here 

00:00:37.059 --> 00:00:43.699
 here are two small keys of the 

00:00:40.249 --> 00:00:45.920
 menu setting though we agree though 

00:00:43.699 --> 00:00:48.979
 go see this button here that 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:51.760
 should command the ignition and the 

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:53.839
 switching off the cam is wrong 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:58.280
 in fact it ends up 

00:00:53.839 --> 00:01:02.479
 practically on the menu key and then 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:05.960
 let's say that by inserting the camera there 

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:09.560
 room you ca n't turn it on or 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:12.680
 to turn it off when it's inside when it is 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:16.000
 inside his case 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:20.510
 then be careful if you receive 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:23.330
 this this keys is wrong then 

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:29.680
 you have to do one cost 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:34.970
 dispute to the seller we say the 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:40.330
 the correct correct it should be 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:43.900
 the one with the right one 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:49.070
 let's just say the right place 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:54.590
 that you can turn on and off the 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:57.460
 range ie how you see a wisdom e 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:57.460
 here it goes out 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:09.080
 okay I recommend there is another 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:14.570
 kind of keeper that I know he has 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:17.480
 also let's say menu keys 

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:20.660
 these words can be done 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:25.670
 adjust the menu even when we succeed 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:28.370
 the camera and inside is fine 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:32.230
 I thank you for following I hope that 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:32.230
 was helpful hello hello
