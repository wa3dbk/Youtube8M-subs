00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:15.100
 Being like it's normal, I do not think so. 

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:18.400
 You know they say right? 

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:22.300
 If you've never been horny, it 's because you have not. 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:26.259
 You now know beauty once more. 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:28.239
 be chased three times in a row only actor 

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:32.200
 murilo benício gets 

00:00:28.239 --> 00:00:36.579
 he was horny when he did the mtur good 

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:40.180
 the jonas bar and ojai of ovaries 

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:44.380
 Antonio was hot and he got a ride. 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:48.460
 with friends ok if the apple generation is 

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:50.470
 running is longer and there is it 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:53.380
 calm for a man when he 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:55.510
 discovers that it 's hard, it's always hard. 

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:57.100
 difficult a betrayal when you trust 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:58.720
 an always complicated person to discover 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:01.780
 that this person betrayed his trust 

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:02.650
 always hurts the ego it hurts a little 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:04.329
 complicated 

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:06.670
 I do not think it's one of the worst 

00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:08.229
 things in the life of a man to be betrayed 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:09.430
 the same way I do not agree when 

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:13.420
 a man entered a woman 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:16.740
 and if that catches him by surprise he's 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:20.010
 with seven 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.280
 this is how I already have it with a person 

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:23.320
 certain 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:24.850
 so I had nothing to let him 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:27.010
 setur 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:30.280
 he went with him because he let himself be 

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:33.640
 It depends a lot on me today I think I do not 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:36.580
 forgive but forgive is divine as a 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:38.409
 Good Christian, I think if I was married 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:40.780
 depending on any circumstance that 

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:43.060
 would involve this betrayal depending on 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:44.950
 how it happened and I think that the 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:48.490
 You can forgive yes. 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:50.649
 is coaching is power and already lost 88 so many 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:54.579
 times, nor forgiven is not this 

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:57.579
 Who are you and or your uncle and you and me? 

00:01:54.579 --> 00:01:59.710
 I say that according to researchers 

00:01:57.579 --> 00:02:02.289
 university of australia 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:05.170
 women realize when the man is 

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:07.210
 attracting more in us what will be that 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:08.769
 realizing that when a woman is 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:10.869
 jumping the fence 

00:02:08.769 --> 00:02:11.769
 I imagine that the case of men being 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:13.390
 discovered 

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:17.049
 the fact that the person of nowhere started 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:18.910
 treat very well and I imagine that this 

00:02:17.049 --> 00:02:20.920
 reflect on female behavior as well 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:23.380
 suddenly the water becomes very tender 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:25.180
 very attentive as if to show 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:26.470
 that nothing had happened outside the 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:31.269
 common relationship 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:33.910
 I realize if I find it more difficult to 

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:36.790
 woman she discovers yes because man 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:39.940
 ends up giving signs and is exposed to 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:42.700
 sometimes he is sure to face with is a 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:46.000
 popular expression but it is well for this 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:47.319
 case even man he leaves is noticeable 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.250
 I think the woman she can hide 

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:50.590
 more 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:52.359
 she has a greater artistic talent for 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:54.579
 this title that you think it is 

00:02:52.359 --> 00:02:57.579
 name of the explosion 

00:02:54.579 --> 00:02:59.680
 He sings, it's cool, you tell the woman. 

00:02:57.579 --> 00:03:03.220
 also pity on hen 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:06.060
 the psychologist flávio gikovate says that the 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:08.829
 infidelity for a man is almost as 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:12.310
 to go to the movies and he 

00:03:08.829 --> 00:03:14.920
 still said that a betrayal could save 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:16.299
 a marriage but will the psychologist 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:19.239
 you're right 

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:21.720
 It will even be horn helps 

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:21.720
 relationship 

00:03:25.409 --> 00:03:29.769
 I think yes some cases the Lord 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:31.360
 cases are different 

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:34.299
 there are couples who must have liked this 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:35.319
 type of behavior but it is not well 

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:38.290
 my style 

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:41.140
 she works a lot, but I think he 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:42.940
 You're right in some ways and I 

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:45.220
 I know some people who report 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:48.159
 certain things and they ask for my 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:50.049
 opinion what they ask that the council is 

00:03:48.159 --> 00:03:52.269
 spiritually speaking how to get out of 

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:54.310
 certain situations and I believe that if a 

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:56.049
 marriage is out of date no longer exists 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:56.890
 My love, that relationship is very 

00:03:56.049 --> 00:03:59.170
 troubled 

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:02.769
 I think if the person has the 

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:04.359
 tell you confess a betrayal and say 

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:06.639
 I do not want to do more but look at my 

00:04:04.359 --> 00:04:07.209
 love is happening explain the whole 

00:04:06.639 --> 00:04:09.639
 situation 

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:11.859
 I think that in this circumstance it can be 

00:04:09.639 --> 00:04:14.200
 beneficial sense to wake up or the woman 

00:04:11.859 --> 00:04:15.459
 also on both sides is to wake up and 

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:17.769
 talk, I do not want to fight for this 

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:20.169
 relationship let's try to stay together 

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:23.160
 I think this aspect may be yes 

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:23.160
 save a wedding 

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:38.889
 the man thinks that the painter lived in 

00:04:35.229 --> 00:04:41.889
 dissatisfaction and repeats in 

00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:41.889
 dissatisfaction 

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:48.380
 i 

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:56.360
 2 same time hey
