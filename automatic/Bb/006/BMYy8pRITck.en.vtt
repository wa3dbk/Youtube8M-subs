00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
this is just a generic brand and I will

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.490 
this is just a generic brand and I will
be<00:01:20.970> using<00:01:21.119> an<00:01:21.420> eyeshadow<00:01:21.600> brush<00:01:21.990> to<00:01:22.229> apply<00:01:22.320> the

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
be using an eyeshadow brush to apply the

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.880 
be using an eyeshadow brush to apply the
baby<00:01:22.770> powder<00:01:23.009> and<00:01:23.600> this<00:01:24.600> is<00:01:24.840> the<00:01:24.960> one<00:01:25.170> I<00:01:25.470> got

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
baby powder and this is the one I got

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.980 
baby powder and this is the one I got
from<00:01:26.580> Walmart<00:01:26.820> I<00:01:27.150> can't<00:01:27.330> remember<00:01:27.479> the<00:01:27.720> brand

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
from Walmart I can't remember the brand

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.870 
from Walmart I can't remember the brand
but<00:01:28.650> this<00:01:28.799> is<00:01:28.950> just<00:01:29.100> a<00:01:29.189> crease<00:01:29.460> brush<00:01:29.700> I

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
but this is just a crease brush I

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.539 
but this is just a crease brush I
figured<00:01:30.180> this<00:01:30.360> was<00:01:30.540> really<00:01:30.810> easy<00:01:31.170> to<00:01:31.549> apply

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
figured this was really easy to apply

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.399 
the baby powder with my eye lashes are
quite<00:01:36.619> long<00:01:37.619> but<00:01:38.210> sparse<00:01:39.210> as<00:01:39.509> you<00:01:39.750> can<00:01:39.900> see<00:01:40.200> now

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
quite long but sparse as you can see now

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:43.520 
quite long but sparse as you can see now
this<00:01:40.590> is<00:01:40.650> without<00:01:41.189> mascara<00:01:41.729> at<00:01:41.939> all<00:01:42.210> I<00:01:42.630> do<00:01:43.320> have

baby powder without baby powder with
baby<00:03:35.209> powder<00:03:37.269> so<00:03:38.269> I<00:03:38.299> do<00:03:38.720> have<00:03:39.080> to<00:03:39.230> say<00:03:39.440> that<00:03:39.620> it

00:03:39.759 --> 00:03:39.769 
baby powder so I do have to say that it

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:42.210 
baby powder so I do have to say that it
does<00:03:39.950> create<00:03:40.310> some<00:03:40.730> thickness<00:03:41.060> to<00:03:41.450> the<00:03:41.569> lashes

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:42.220 
does create some thickness to the lashes

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:47.080 
does create some thickness to the lashes
I'm<00:03:43.220> not<00:03:43.549> really<00:03:43.790> sure<00:03:44.209> that<00:03:44.239> it<00:03:44.750> is<00:03:45.519> for<00:03:46.519> me<00:03:46.790> I

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:47.090 
I'm not really sure that it is for me I

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:49.360 
I'm not really sure that it is for me I
personally<00:03:47.180> like<00:03:47.959> the<00:03:48.319> fullness<00:03:48.590> and<00:03:49.040> the

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:49.370 
personally like the fullness and the

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:52.360 
personally like the fullness and the
volume<00:03:49.790> that<00:03:49.819> falsies<00:03:50.780> create<00:03:51.230> without<00:03:51.950> the

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:52.370 
volume that falsies create without the

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:56.319 
volume that falsies create without the
stringy<00:03:53.230> clumpy<00:03:54.230> eyelash<00:03:54.890> look<00:03:55.280> as<00:03:55.609> you<00:03:56.209> can

00:03:56.319 --> 00:03:56.329 
stringy clumpy eyelash look as you can

00:03:56.329 --> 00:03:58.390 
stringy clumpy eyelash look as you can
see<00:03:56.540> here<00:03:56.780> although<00:03:56.959> it's<00:03:57.230> not<00:03:57.380> terrible

00:03:58.390 --> 00:03:58.400 
see here although it's not terrible

00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:59.770 
see here although it's not terrible
it<00:03:58.700> depends<00:03:59.090> what<00:03:59.180> kind<00:03:59.329> of<00:03:59.420> look<00:03:59.600> you're

00:03:59.770 --> 00:03:59.780 
it depends what kind of look you're

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:03.360 
it depends what kind of look you're
going<00:03:59.989> for<00:04:00.459> personally<00:04:01.459> not<00:04:01.609> my<00:04:01.880> favorite

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:03.370 
going for personally not my favorite

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:06.130 
going for personally not my favorite
just<00:04:04.370> because<00:04:04.609> quite<00:04:05.000> clumpy<00:04:05.510> and<00:04:05.540> I<00:04:05.810> wonder

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:06.140 
just because quite clumpy and I wonder

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:08.890 
just because quite clumpy and I wonder
if<00:04:06.350> a<00:04:06.680> different<00:04:07.069> brand<00:04:07.819> of<00:04:08.030> mascara<00:04:08.540> might

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:08.900 
if a different brand of mascara might

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:11.470 
if a different brand of mascara might
work<00:04:09.200> a<00:04:09.350> little<00:04:09.620> bit<00:04:09.739> better<00:04:10.010> to<00:04:10.940> make<00:04:11.090> it<00:04:11.120> less

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:11.480 
work a little bit better to make it less

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:14.020 
work a little bit better to make it less
stringy<00:04:12.440> if<00:04:12.920> you<00:04:13.100> can<00:04:13.250> see<00:04:13.459> what<00:04:13.609> I<00:04:13.640> mean<00:04:13.819> but

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:14.030 
stringy if you can see what I mean but

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:15.970 
stringy if you can see what I mean but
it<00:04:14.150> does<00:04:14.329> create<00:04:14.660> a<00:04:14.870> lot<00:04:15.109> of<00:04:15.230> fullness<00:04:15.440> to<00:04:15.859> the

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:15.980 
it does create a lot of fullness to the

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:19.930 
it does create a lot of fullness to the
lashes<00:04:16.310> itself<00:04:17.769> as<00:04:18.769> far<00:04:19.100> as<00:04:19.220> a<00:04:19.250> pass<00:04:19.519> or<00:04:19.760> fail

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:19.940 
lashes itself as far as a pass or fail

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:22.510 
lashes itself as far as a pass or fail
it<00:04:20.209> did<00:04:20.450> do<00:04:20.750> what<00:04:21.109> it<00:04:21.229> claimed<00:04:21.530> to<00:04:21.859> which<00:04:22.220> was

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:22.520 
it did do what it claimed to which was

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:25.570 
it did do what it claimed to which was
create<00:04:22.940> fullness<00:04:23.450> in<00:04:23.750> your<00:04:24.020> lashes<00:04:24.560> so<00:04:24.800> I

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:25.580 
create fullness in your lashes so I

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:27.730 
create fullness in your lashes so I
would<00:04:25.729> give<00:04:25.880> it<00:04:25.970> a<00:04:26.000> pass<00:04:26.180> on<00:04:26.450> that<00:04:26.630> as<00:04:27.080> far<00:04:27.500> as<00:04:27.710> a

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:27.740 
would give it a pass on that as far as a

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:30.730 
would give it a pass on that as far as a
substitute<00:04:28.639> for<00:04:28.880> falsies<00:04:29.750> I<00:04:30.020> wouldn't<00:04:30.590> have

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:30.740 
substitute for falsies I wouldn't have

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:32.710 
substitute for falsies I wouldn't have
to<00:04:30.919> agree<00:04:31.220> because<00:04:31.430> falsies<00:04:32.090> do<00:04:32.300> look<00:04:32.510> a<00:04:32.600> lot

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:32.720 
to agree because falsies do look a lot

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:34.900 
to agree because falsies do look a lot
different<00:04:32.780> and<00:04:33.470> I<00:04:33.950> personally<00:04:34.460> like<00:04:34.669> them<00:04:34.850> a

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:34.910 
different and I personally like them a

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:39.010 
different and I personally like them a
little<00:04:35.330> bit<00:04:35.450> better<00:04:35.770> so<00:04:36.880> you<00:04:37.880> know<00:04:38.060> what<00:04:38.300> if

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:39.020 
little bit better so you know what if

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:41.230 
little bit better so you know what if
this<00:04:39.889> is<00:04:40.070> the<00:04:40.100> look<00:04:40.400> you're<00:04:40.580> going<00:04:40.729> for<00:04:40.850> then
