00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
 hello friends of the movie welcome to 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:05.670
 dvd criticism still sniffs that 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:06.990
 I apologize but that 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:08.130
 they would not stop that for a long time 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:09.960
 to talk about movies 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.490
 and today a comedy is supposed to go and 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.349
 the comedy is known to be one of the 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.480
 the most difficult film genre because that 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:16.980
 audience really hearty laughs that 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.750
 requires good acting talent 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:22.939
 Good gags and a decent portion 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:27.029
 timing and that's about it today as well 

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:28.810
 in 2005 no banker in a new 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.630
 House 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:34.439
 clean up in events of complete 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:34.439
 be educated 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:44.080
 hey baby you stink the clarifier we 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:47.700
 examine para normal activities in the 

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:47.700
 house of the johnstons in a suburb of 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:04.030
 I chip and you need to remember 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:05.890
 madness how do you know that i'm in 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:09.160
 my body is completely different 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:11.830
 how far would you go around that 

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:20.630
 demon to be lost i would do anything 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:22.040
 what we bring are honest 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:26.119
 Watching TV can not wait for the 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:29.259
 be off the finger to get revealed 

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:29.259
 that you should do through yoga 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:38.470
 the stress is found 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:59.050
 she has affected schneider 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:00.280
 i am dad as we tumbled to 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:09.450
 to exorcise delme 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:09.450
 do you want to put the key 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:26.280
 the break is staggering 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:28.050
 oh my god wants to have her post 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:30.090
 mobile original title the haunted house 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:32.040
 again a great german movie title 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:33.270
 choice though original title also 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:35.670
 English is a nonsense 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:37.080
 no matter what from 2012 and staring 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:39.360
 fits this week on 21 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:42.060
 february 2013 tells the story of 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:43.200
 merkel and kisha the two together 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.880
 Merkel became his best friend 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.620
 never violence be a woman and never be 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:48.720
 to let house because that would be the 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:50.520
 Sexual life put an abrupt end to this 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:52.440
 he does not want to believe and would not be 

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:55.170
 everything enough already moves in with her 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:57.420
 daemon into the house and that's cosmo 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:59.280
 like a comedy in the scary movie it the 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:01.290
 wheels of the scary movie song and the 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:03.600
 entire series should look exactly 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:04.980
 because that's what you get what you get 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:06.540
 one is expected to see the trailer and 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:07.950
 That's why a fair deal is what you 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:09.480
 see is what you get and that's why 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:11.640
 that's kind of okay 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:13.590
 humorist here used to be full of fecal and 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:15.090
 Sexual gags and that runs over the 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:16.980
 full term 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:18.660
 and so it is admittedly by 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:20.670
 Timing in the first 15 minutes 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:22.380
 really a few pips about you 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:24.000
 had to laugh properly because of this 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:25.170
 dumb photo dude tables and trailer 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.209
 is going to burn is actually total 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:29.190
 funny there he was repeated many times 

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:30.360
 that you really start laughing in the cinema 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:31.980
 I was surprised about that , though 

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:34.530
 after the first 20 or say 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:37.050
 the film is built for a maximum of 30 minutes 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:39.270
 unbelievable and that to the end 

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:40.739
 of course remains predictable and makes 

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:42.000
 then not so much fun and that 

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:43.680
 that's the end of one 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.140
 film remains what you have in the last 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:47.670
 minutes so it always experiences what in the 

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:50.190
 head so also gets stuck and that is 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:51.570
 Not much here but a fair one 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:53.220
 which as I said from the trailer sees 

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:56.280
 then you get the whole thing 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:57.480
 track 80 minutes and so you should 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:59.430
 Not too upset about it my 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:01.260
 humor is not only a little bit too 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:02.610
 little too cool if I'm honest 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.650
 you could do it a bit more 

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:06.239
 pure and modern lift and that's why I am 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:07.800
 strained the movie and otherwise 

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:09.690
 one or the other film like that 

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:11.520
 a little on the grain so there is the 1 

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:14.340
 swipe at django unchained and still 

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:15.870
 a few other movie titles that one 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:17.610
 bit the actuality of the strip 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:19.440
 but emphasize otherwise 

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:21.150
 not so worth mentioning 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:22.980
 ok friends you'll just where we are 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:24.390
 look yes or no leave me a lot for 

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:26.970
 your opinion on this film in the 

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:29.190
 comments because I give him as a comedy 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:30.510
 because I smile from time to time 

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:32.610
 But I did not have to do it halfway 

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:35.100
 out of 10 possible points and total 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:36.840
 three out of ten possible points 

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:38.790
 that was it from me for today i have to 

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:40.110
 I would rather cure myself maybe comes 

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:41.370
 Today still a trailer check but me 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:42.720
 can not promise otherwise 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:45.120
 of course at 15 o'clock tomorrow at the latest 

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:46.050
 a new video and by that time I hope 

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:49.820
 you will be back tomorrow 

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:49.820
 of course at 3
