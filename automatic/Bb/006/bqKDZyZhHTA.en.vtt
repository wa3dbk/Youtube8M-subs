the<00:02:23.790> shape<00:02:24.000> just<00:02:24.030> about<00:02:24.480> right<00:02:24.810> we'll<00:02:25.050> place

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
the shape just about right we'll place

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:27.470 
the shape just about right we'll place
that<00:02:25.650> over<00:02:25.860> our<00:02:26.010> piece<00:02:26.400> of<00:02:26.430> wood<00:02:26.610> and<00:02:27.030> use<00:02:27.300> it

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
that over our piece of wood and use it

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.360 
that over our piece of wood and use it
as<00:02:27.570> a<00:02:27.600> template<00:02:28.080> and<00:02:28.200> then<00:02:28.710> cut<00:02:29.010> our<00:02:29.130> piece<00:02:29.340> of

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
as a template and then cut our piece of

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:31.770 
wood to shape a half inch hole needs to

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:33.710 
wood to shape a half inch hole needs to
be<00:02:31.860> drilled<00:02:32.220> lengthwise<00:02:32.880> through<00:02:32.940> the<00:02:33.540> block

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
be drilled lengthwise through the block

be drilled lengthwise through the block
of<00:02:33.900> wood<00:02:33.930> so<00:02:34.500> a<00:02:34.710> paddle<00:02:35.340> bit<00:02:35.520> is<00:02:35.730> the<00:02:35.880> best

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
of wood so a paddle bit is the best

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:37.130 
of wood so a paddle bit is the best
thing<00:02:36.210> you've<00:02:36.300> used<00:02:36.480> for<00:02:36.630> that<00:02:36.720> because<00:02:36.900> it's

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
thing you've used for that because it's

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.050 
thing you've used for that because it's
long<00:02:37.380> enough<00:02:37.410> and<00:02:37.950> when<00:02:38.430> I<00:02:38.460> was<00:02:38.640> done<00:02:38.850> I

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
long enough and when I was done I

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:40.790 
long enough and when I was done I
decided<00:02:39.120> I<00:02:39.570> wanted<00:02:39.810> to<00:02:39.960> match<00:02:40.170> the<00:02:40.440> helmet<00:02:40.770> so

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:40.800 
decided I wanted to match the helmet so

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:43.220 
decided I wanted to match the helmet so
I<00:02:41.040> hit<00:02:41.340> it<00:02:41.460> with<00:02:41.610> some<00:02:41.880> gloss<00:02:42.210> red<00:02:42.510> paint<00:02:42.840> in

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
I hit it with some gloss red paint in

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:44.870 
I hit it with some gloss red paint in
order<00:02:43.740> to<00:02:43.830> go<00:02:43.920> from<00:02:44.100> the<00:02:44.190> three-quarter<00:02:44.730> inch

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:44.880 
order to go from the three-quarter inch

order to go from the three-quarter inch
fitting<00:02:45.120> on<00:02:45.420> the<00:02:45.660> water<00:02:45.930> nozzle<00:02:46.140> down<00:02:46.560> to<00:02:46.830> half

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:47.070 
fitting on the water nozzle down to half

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:49.100 
fitting on the water nozzle down to half
inch<00:02:47.340> of<00:02:47.490> our<00:02:47.610> plastic<00:02:48.090> tube<00:02:48.330> I<00:02:48.540> needed<00:02:49.050> a

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.110 
inch of our plastic tube I needed a

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:50.690 
inch of our plastic tube I needed a
couple<00:02:49.230> of<00:02:49.440> adapters<00:02:49.920> to<00:02:49.950> make<00:02:50.310> that<00:02:50.490> happen

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
couple of adapters to make that happen

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:53.420 
couple of adapters to make that happen
and<00:02:51.030> then<00:02:51.690> the<00:02:51.870> plastic<00:02:52.050> tube<00:02:52.440> is<00:02:52.740> run<00:02:53.190> through

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
and then the plastic tube is run through

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:55.700 
and then the plastic tube is run through
the<00:02:53.520> block<00:02:53.790> of<00:02:54.000> wood<00:02:54.030> and<00:02:54.390> our<00:02:55.110> water<00:02:55.440> nozzle

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:43.400 
gallons goes a long way and it's a high
pressure<00:03:38.010> spray<00:03:41.780> so<00:03:42.780> that's<00:03:42.959> how<00:03:43.110> to<00:03:43.140> make<00:03:43.350> a

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:43.410 
pressure spray so that's how to make a

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:45.650 
pressure spray so that's how to make a
head<00:03:43.740> mounted<00:03:44.160> water<00:03:44.490> cannon<00:03:45.000> we'll<00:03:45.390> see<00:03:45.570> you

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:45.660 
head mounted water cannon we'll see you

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:49.820 
head mounted water cannon we'll see you
next<00:03:45.810> week<00:03:46.050> with<00:03:46.320> another<00:03:46.380> weekend<00:03:47.220> project
