00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
tracks I think what we did 27 tracks be

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.260 
tracks I think what we did 27 tracks be
over<00:01:24.990> over<00:01:25.320> the<00:01:25.409> span<00:01:25.619> of<00:01:25.680> the<00:01:25.950> two<00:01:26.130> cds<00:01:26.580> some

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
over over the span of the two cds some

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.569 
over over the span of the two cds some
of<00:01:27.390> the<00:01:27.479> artists<00:01:27.900> have<00:01:28.020> two<00:01:28.259> tracks<00:01:28.650> on<00:01:29.340> the

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:25.270 
never gets tired

00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:27.180 
never gets tired
and<00:06:25.600> that<00:06:25.780> it's<00:06:25.930> constantly<00:06:26.440> reinventing

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:27.190 
and that it's constantly reinventing

00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:29.370
