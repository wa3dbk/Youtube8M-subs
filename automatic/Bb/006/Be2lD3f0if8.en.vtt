00:00:01.819 --> 00:00:01.829 
I guess we're back with a few more of

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:03.409 
I guess we're back with a few more of
our<00:00:01.920> questions<00:00:02.370> and<00:00:02.520> are<00:00:02.580> most<00:00:02.850> frequently

00:00:03.409 --> 00:00:03.419 
our questions and are most frequently

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:05.180 
our questions and are most frequently
asked<00:00:03.629> question<00:00:04.020> you<00:00:04.110> guys<00:00:04.230> is<00:00:04.410> how<00:00:04.560> can<00:00:04.920> i<00:00:04.980> use

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:05.190 
asked question you guys is how can i use

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:07.760 
asked question you guys is how can i use
the<00:00:05.310> caller<00:00:05.549> to<00:00:05.700> correct<00:00:05.970> us<00:00:06.089> in<00:00:06.270> that<00:00:06.420> map<00:00:06.770> so

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:07.770 
the caller to correct us in that map so

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:08.960 
the caller to correct us in that map so
we<00:00:07.799> have<00:00:07.980> the<00:00:08.069> video<00:00:08.189> the<00:00:08.460> other<00:00:08.580> day<00:00:08.700> about

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:08.970 
we have the video the other day about

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:10.970 
we have the video the other day about
this<00:00:09.240> you<00:00:09.389> guys<00:00:09.570> but<00:00:09.780> the<00:00:09.900> main<00:00:10.139> then<00:00:10.530> you<00:00:10.769> want

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
this you guys but the main then you want

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.160 
this you guys but the main then you want
to<00:00:11.040> remember<00:00:11.280> we're<00:00:11.670> using<00:00:12.150> the<00:00:12.330> caller<00:00:12.750> to

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
to remember we're using the caller to

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.010 
to remember we're using the caller to
motivate<00:00:13.860> behaviors<00:00:14.639> big<00:00:15.299> behaviors<00:00:15.809> get

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
motivate behaviors big behaviors get

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.099 
motivate behaviors big behaviors get
stronger<00:00:16.520> first<00:00:17.520> before<00:00:17.940> we<00:00:18.330> do<00:00:18.510> try<00:00:18.810> to<00:00:18.840> do

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
stronger first before we do try to do

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:22.099 
stronger first before we do try to do
anything<00:00:19.350> to<00:00:20.039> extinguish<00:00:20.730> behavior<00:00:21.660> so<00:00:21.960> if

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
anything to extinguish behavior so if

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:25.970 
anything to extinguish behavior so if
you<00:00:22.230> start<00:00:22.619> out<00:00:22.920> with<00:00:23.189> the<00:00:23.340> caller<00:00:24.830> trying<00:00:25.830> to

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
you start out with the caller trying to

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:27.830 
you start out with the caller trying to
use<00:00:26.160> it<00:00:26.340> as<00:00:26.460> punishment<00:00:26.910> in<00:00:27.210> the<00:00:27.300> beginning<00:00:27.449> I

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
use it as punishment in the beginning I

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.410 
use it as punishment in the beginning I
mean<00:00:27.990> honestly<00:00:28.320> shoot<00:00:28.619> yourself<00:00:28.980> in<00:00:29.070> the<00:00:29.130> foot

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:29.420 
mean honestly shoot yourself in the foot

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:31.820 
mean honestly shoot yourself in the foot
you<00:00:30.420> know<00:00:30.539> and<00:00:30.750> then<00:00:30.900> you've<00:00:31.349> given<00:00:31.710> the

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
you know and then you've given the

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:36.130 
you know and then you've given the
caller<00:00:32.130> a<00:00:32.309> very<00:00:32.669> bad<00:00:33.230> connotation<00:00:34.230> so

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:36.140 
caller a very bad connotation so

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:38.360 
caller a very bad connotation so
motivating<00:00:37.140> the<00:00:37.260> dog<00:00:37.469> we're<00:00:37.860> not<00:00:38.010> the<00:00:38.250> you

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
motivating the dog we're not the you

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.190 
motivating the dog we're not the you
know<00:00:38.489> they're<00:00:38.700> the<00:00:38.940> you<00:00:39.780> know<00:00:39.870> we're<00:00:40.050> not

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
know they're the you know we're not

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.799 
know they're the you know we're not
using<00:00:40.649> the<00:00:41.100> caller<00:00:41.370> to<00:00:41.850> gain<00:00:42.090> the<00:00:42.390> anonymity

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
using the caller to gain the anonymity

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.799 
using the caller to gain the anonymity
of<00:00:42.960> the<00:00:43.260> dog<00:00:43.620> so<00:00:44.190> we're<00:00:44.850> using<00:00:44.969> the<00:00:45.210> color<00:00:45.390> to

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
of the dog so we're using the color to

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.869 
of the dog so we're using the color to
motivate<00:00:46.289> the<00:00:46.410> behaviors<00:00:46.860> that<00:00:47.070> we<00:00:47.219> want<00:00:47.520> make

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
motivate the behaviors that we want make

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.779 
motivate the behaviors that we want make
them<00:00:48.090> stronger<00:00:48.480> and<00:00:48.899> then<00:00:49.770> what<00:00:50.370> what<00:00:50.579> that

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
them stronger and then what what that

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.060 
them stronger and then what what that
will<00:00:51.059> do<00:00:51.270> okay<00:00:51.989> so<00:00:52.050> now<00:00:52.289> we've<00:00:52.469> got<00:00:52.770> all<00:00:52.949> these

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
will do okay so now we've got all these

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.840 
will do okay so now we've got all these
behaviors<00:00:53.670> up<00:00:53.879> here<00:00:54.949> what<00:00:55.949> we<00:00:56.070> you<00:00:56.340> know<00:00:56.640> that

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
behaviors up here what we you know that

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.369 
behaviors up here what we you know that
if<00:00:56.969> you've<00:00:57.090> got<00:00:57.270> these<00:00:57.480> other<00:00:57.690> behaviors<00:00:58.230> that

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
if you've got these other behaviors that

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.400 
if you've got these other behaviors that
you<00:00:58.500> want<00:00:58.770> to<00:00:58.800> extinguish<00:00:59.359> by<00:01:00.359> motivating<00:01:01.170> all

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
you want to extinguish by motivating all

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:02.720 
you want to extinguish by motivating all
these<00:01:01.530> other<00:01:01.710> behaviors<00:01:02.190> you've<00:01:02.340> really

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
these other behaviors you've really

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.880 
these other behaviors you've really
helped<00:01:03.059> weaken<00:01:03.510> the<00:01:03.629> ones<00:01:03.870> you<00:01:04.110> don't<00:01:04.290> want<00:01:04.739> we

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
helped weaken the ones you don't want we

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.170 
helped weaken the ones you don't want we
always<00:01:05.189> talked<00:01:05.400> about<00:01:05.430> that<00:01:05.850> with<00:01:06.000> the

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
always talked about that with the

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:07.910 
always talked about that with the
jumping<00:01:06.659> when<00:01:06.780> people<00:01:07.080> bring<00:01:07.260> dogs<00:01:07.590> for

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
jumping when people bring dogs for

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.719 
jumping when people bring dogs for
jumping<00:01:08.400> everybody<00:01:08.790> says<00:01:09.060> the<00:01:09.210> dog<00:01:09.390> jumps<00:01:10.729> we

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
jumping everybody says the dog jumps we

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.450 
jumping everybody says the dog jumps we
ignore<00:01:12.450> it<00:01:12.689> in<00:01:12.960> the<00:01:13.110> beginning<00:01:13.260> we<00:01:13.860> work<00:01:14.220> on

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
ignore it in the beginning we work on

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.450 
ignore it in the beginning we work on
motivating<00:01:15.150> making<00:01:15.689> the<00:01:15.810> down<00:01:16.140> a<00:01:16.560> very<00:01:16.979> strong

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
motivating making the down a very strong

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.719 
motivating making the down a very strong
behavior<00:01:18.030> so<00:01:18.240> we<00:01:18.390> can<00:01:18.570> strengthen<00:01:19.500> that<00:01:20.009> by

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
behavior so we can strengthen that by

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.090 
behavior so we can strengthen that by
doing<00:01:20.790> that<00:01:21.420> we're<00:01:21.840> actually<00:01:22.049> decreasing<00:01:22.950> the

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
doing that we're actually decreasing the

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.219 
doing that we're actually decreasing the
jumping<00:01:23.610> up<00:01:23.820> so<00:01:24.540> now<00:01:24.720> we've<00:01:24.960> made<00:01:25.200> that

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
jumping up so now we've made that

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.320 
jumping up so now we've made that
behavior<00:01:25.890> a<00:01:25.950> lot<00:01:26.250> weaker<00:01:26.520> and<00:01:26.909> it's<00:01:27.090> going<00:01:27.240> to

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
behavior a lot weaker and it's going to

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.899 
behavior a lot weaker and it's going to
be<00:01:27.479> easier<00:01:27.750> to<00:01:28.080> correct<00:01:28.650> it<00:01:28.860> at<00:01:28.979> that<00:01:29.189> point<00:01:29.549> so

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
be easier to correct it at that point so

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.660 
be easier to correct it at that point so
it's<00:01:30.600> just<00:01:30.810> one<00:01:30.990> of<00:01:31.020> the<00:01:31.259> things<00:01:32.130> people<00:01:32.520> don't

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
it's just one of the things people don't

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.850 
it's just one of the things people don't
understand<00:01:33.390> about<00:01:33.509> the<00:01:33.780> collars<00:01:34.259> they<00:01:34.500> just

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
understand about the collars they just

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.920 
understand about the collars they just
want<00:01:35.159> to<00:01:35.280> get<00:01:35.430> it<00:01:35.610> and<00:01:35.790> use<00:01:36.090> it<00:01:36.119> for<00:01:36.420> this<00:01:36.570> need

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
want to get it and use it for this need

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.620 
want to get it and use it for this need
your<00:01:37.259> correction<00:01:38.159> for<00:01:38.790> these<00:01:38.909> behaviors<00:01:39.450> that

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
your correction for these behaviors that

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:40.969 
your correction for these behaviors that
they<00:01:39.780> don't<00:01:39.990> want<00:01:40.229> and<00:01:40.380> believe<00:01:40.590> me<00:01:40.710> I<00:01:40.740> can

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
they don't want and believe me I can

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.190 
they don't want and believe me I can
empathize<00:01:41.130> with<00:01:41.400> you<00:01:41.790> because<00:01:41.970> you<00:01:42.240> know<00:01:43.049> all

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
empathize with you because you know all

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.310 
empathize with you because you know all
this<00:01:43.350> it's

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:44.320 
this it's

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:46.050 
this it's
very<00:01:44.440> easy<00:01:44.710> to<00:01:44.920> get<00:01:45.010> frustrated<00:01:45.700> with<00:01:45.850> things

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:46.060 
very easy to get frustrated with things

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:48.719 
very easy to get frustrated with things
but<00:01:46.300> unless<00:01:47.110> we<00:01:47.530> have<00:01:47.860> done<00:01:48.070> used<00:01:48.370> a<00:01:48.490> collar
