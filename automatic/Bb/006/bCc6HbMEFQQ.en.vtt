that<00:00:40.290> this<00:00:40.530> kingston<00:00:41.219> 8<00:00:41.879> gig<00:00:42.180> ram<00:00:42.390> in<00:00:42.629> total

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
that this kingston 8 gig ram in total

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.080 
that this kingston 8 gig ram in total
will<00:00:43.410> really<00:00:43.770> speed<00:00:44.070> up<00:00:44.160> my<00:00:44.280> pc<00:00:44.760> and<00:00:44.850> give<00:00:44.969> it

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
will really speed up my pc and give it

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:46.760 
will really speed up my pc and give it
some<00:00:45.239> great<00:00:45.390> processing<00:00:46.140> speed<00:00:46.440> when<00:00:46.649> i'm

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
to talk about these new beast sets

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.190 
to talk about these new beast sets
around<00:01:34.320> they<00:01:34.740> becoming<00:01:35.520> fingers<00:01:36.420> up<00:01:36.540> to<00:01:36.570> 64

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
around they becoming fingers up to 64

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.050 
around they becoming fingers up to 64
gigabyte<00:01:37.590> and<00:01:37.710> they<00:01:38.189> all<00:01:38.280> come<00:01:38.520> in<00:01:38.549> sets<00:01:38.939> of

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
gigabyte and they all come in sets of

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.969 
gigabyte and they all come in sets of
two<00:01:39.299> so<00:01:39.570> obviously<00:01:39.869> if<00:01:39.990> it's<00:01:40.140> a<00:01:40.200> 64<00:01:40.740> gigabyte

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
two so obviously if it's a 64 gigabyte

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:44.120 
two so obviously if it's a 64 gigabyte
you'll<00:01:41.310> have<00:01:41.430> two<00:01:41.610> 32<00:01:42.119> gigabyte<00:01:42.540> RAM<00:01:42.979> but<00:01:43.979> it

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
you'll have two 32 gigabyte RAM but it

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.030 
you'll have two 32 gigabyte RAM but it
goes<00:01:44.280> they<00:01:44.490> go<00:01:44.700> all<00:01:44.909> the<00:01:44.970> way<00:01:45.180> from<00:01:46.040> 1600

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
goes they go all the way from 1600

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.600 
goes they go all the way from 1600
megahertz<00:01:47.310> all<00:01:47.670> the<00:01:47.759> way<00:01:47.850> up<00:01:47.909> to<00:01:48.110> 2400<00:01:49.110> as<00:01:49.259> well

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:49.610 
megahertz all the way up to 2400 as well

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:52.340 
megahertz all the way up to 2400 as well
there's<00:01:50.610> some<00:01:50.939> great<00:01:51.149> little<00:01:51.450> things<00:01:51.780> about

pcs and putting my own components in it

00:03:58.569 --> 00:04:00.839 
pcs and putting my own components in it
so<00:03:59.109> I'm<00:03:59.260> hoping<00:03:59.470> by<00:03:59.859> doing<00:04:00.129> these<00:04:00.280> videos<00:04:00.639> of

00:04:00.839 --> 00:04:00.849 
so I'm hoping by doing these videos of

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:02.849 
so I'm hoping by doing these videos of
stuff<00:04:01.299> that<00:04:01.449> RAM<00:04:01.690> and<00:04:01.959> get<00:04:02.440> a<00:04:02.470> bit<00:04:02.680> more

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:02.859 
stuff that RAM and get a bit more

00:04:02.859 --> 00:04:05.099 
stuff that RAM and get a bit more
experienced<00:04:03.400> in<00:04:03.489> that<00:04:03.549> industry<00:04:03.940> and<00:04:04.540> but

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:05.109 
experienced in that industry and but

00:04:05.109 --> 00:04:06.569 
experienced in that industry and but
here<00:04:05.260> you<00:04:05.319> go<00:04:05.470> here's<00:04:05.739> one<00:04:05.919> of<00:04:06.040> the<00:04:06.129> RAM<00:04:06.310> guys

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:06.579 
here you go here's one of the RAM guys

00:04:06.579 --> 00:04:08.610 
here you go here's one of the RAM guys
they<00:04:06.790> are<00:04:06.970> identical<00:04:07.720> so<00:04:07.930> I'm<00:04:08.290> just<00:04:08.470> going<00:04:08.590> to

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:08.620 
they are identical so I'm just going to

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:11.789 
they are identical so I'm just going to
show<00:04:08.829> you<00:04:08.859> this<00:04:09.040> close-up<00:04:09.340> right<00:04:09.760> now<00:04:10.799> HyperX

00:04:11.789 --> 00:04:11.799 
show you this close-up right now HyperX

00:04:11.799 --> 00:04:13.589 
show you this close-up right now HyperX
a<00:04:11.979> beast<00:04:12.250> it<00:04:12.489> says<00:04:12.669> on<00:04:12.849> the<00:04:12.940> front<00:04:12.970> and<00:04:13.449> then

00:04:13.589 --> 00:04:13.599 
a beast it says on the front and then

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:15.180 
a beast it says on the front and then
you've<00:04:13.750> got<00:04:13.930> some<00:04:13.959> specifications<00:04:14.889> I'll<00:04:15.010> try

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:15.190 
you've got some specifications I'll try

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:18.390 
you've got some specifications I'll try
and<00:04:15.340> show<00:04:15.519> you<00:04:15.549> that<00:04:15.849> close<00:04:16.389> up<00:04:17.190> then<00:04:18.190> you<00:04:18.280> got

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:18.400 
and show you that close up then you got

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:20.490 
and show you that close up then you got
the<00:04:18.489> Kingston<00:04:18.940> logo<00:04:19.359> but<00:04:19.959> yeah<00:04:20.079> it's<00:04:20.229> quite<00:04:20.469> a

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:20.500 
the Kingston logo but yeah it's quite a

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:22.409 
the Kingston logo but yeah it's quite a
thick<00:04:20.919> looking<00:04:21.250> Ram<00:04:21.459> it<00:04:21.700> feels<00:04:21.940> very<00:04:22.180> well

00:04:22.409 --> 00:04:22.419 
thick looking Ram it feels very well

00:04:22.419 --> 00:04:23.330 
thick looking Ram it feels very well
built<00:04:22.719> as

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:23.340 
built as

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:24.560 
built as
not<00:04:23.430> heavier<00:04:23.699> than<00:04:23.850> normal<00:04:23.880> round<00:04:24.330> because

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:24.570 
not heavier than normal round because

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:26.689 
not heavier than normal round because
obviously<00:04:24.750> you've<00:04:25.560> got<00:04:25.740> this<00:04:25.860> casing<00:04:26.400> around

00:04:26.689 --> 00:04:26.699 
obviously you've got this casing around

00:04:26.699 --> 00:04:28.400 
obviously you've got this casing around
it<00:04:26.910> but<00:04:27.030> the<00:04:27.660> good<00:04:27.840> thing<00:04:27.990> about<00:04:28.020> hyper

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:28.410 
it but the good thing about hyper

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:31.010 
it but the good thing about hyper
exports<00:04:29.040> is<00:04:29.190> the<00:04:29.370> is<00:04:30.000> the<00:04:30.210> customization<00:04:30.600> you

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:31.020 
exports is the is the customization you

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:32.510 
exports is the is the customization you
get<00:04:31.320> from<00:04:31.530> the<00:04:31.590> actual<00:04:31.830> look<00:04:31.979> of<00:04:32.100> the<00:04:32.190> product

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:32.520 
get from the actual look of the product

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:34.400 
get from the actual look of the product
so<00:04:32.760> what<00:04:33.360> I'm<00:04:33.479> going<00:04:33.600> to<00:04:33.630> do<00:04:33.810> now<00:04:33.960> guys<00:04:34.229> are

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:34.410 
so what I'm going to do now guys are

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:35.990 
so what I'm going to do now guys are
going<00:04:34.530> to<00:04:34.590> install<00:04:34.740> this<00:04:35.010> in<00:04:35.190> my<00:04:35.310> PC<00:04:35.760> and<00:04:35.790> then

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:36.000 
going to install this in my PC and then

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.790 
going to install this in my PC and then
run<00:04:36.210> another<00:04:36.419> test<00:04:36.660> after<00:04:37.050> to<00:04:37.139> show<00:04:37.440> you<00:04:37.500> guys

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:37.800 
run another test after to show you guys

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:39.680 
run another test after to show you guys
the<00:04:38.010> upgrades<00:04:38.550> and<00:04:38.820> the<00:04:38.910> better<00:04:39.210> speeds<00:04:39.510> that

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:39.690 
the upgrades and the better speeds that

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:41.330 
the upgrades and the better speeds that
I<00:04:39.750> can<00:04:39.870> hopefully<00:04:40.050> get<00:04:40.320> with<00:04:40.470> this<00:04:40.530> ramp<00:04:40.830> so

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:41.340 
I can hopefully get with this ramp so

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:43.730 
I can hopefully get with this ramp so
stay<00:04:41.639> tuned<00:04:41.850> to<00:04:42.000> the<00:04:42.090> video<00:04:42.300> right<00:04:43.290> guys<00:04:43.500> now

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:43.740 
stay tuned to the video right guys now

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:45.320 
stay tuned to the video right guys now
I've<00:04:43.889> installed<00:04:44.040> the<00:04:44.430> RAM<00:04:44.610> so<00:04:45.000> now<00:04:45.180> I<00:04:45.210> just

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:45.330 
I've installed the RAM so now I just

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:47.300 
I've installed the RAM so now I just
wanted<00:04:45.660> to<00:04:45.750> show<00:04:45.900> you<00:04:45.930> guys<00:04:46.169> the<00:04:46.500> new<00:04:46.979> test

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:47.310 
wanted to show you guys the new test

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:50.000 
wanted to show you guys the new test
results<00:04:47.790> it's<00:04:48.720> now<00:04:48.900> showing<00:04:48.930> here<00:04:49.590> that<00:04:49.620> there

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:50.010 
results it's now showing here that there

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:54.140 
results it's now showing here that there
is<00:04:50.449> 8190<00:04:51.449> megabytes<00:04:51.900> of<00:04:52.400> RAM<00:04:53.400> in<00:04:53.910> now

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:54.150 
is 8190 megabytes of RAM in now

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:56.270 
is 8190 megabytes of RAM in now
installed<00:04:54.600> in<00:04:54.750> my<00:04:54.840> machine<00:04:54.990> the<00:04:55.680> RAM<00:04:55.889> speed

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:56.280 
installed in my machine the RAM speed

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:59.120 
installed in my machine the RAM speed
has<00:04:56.490> gone<00:04:56.790> up<00:04:56.940> pre<00:04:57.419> quite<00:04:58.380> a<00:04:58.410> lot<00:04:58.590> to<00:04:58.800> be<00:04:58.889> honest

00:04:59.120 --> 00:04:59.130 
has gone up pre quite a lot to be honest

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:01.280 
has gone up pre quite a lot to be honest
that's<00:05:00.030> probably<00:05:00.360> because<00:05:00.510> obviously<00:05:00.810> the

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:01.290 
that's probably because obviously the

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:03.020 
that's probably because obviously the
RAM<00:05:01.650> is<00:05:01.800> a<00:05:01.860> lot<00:05:02.010> better<00:05:02.190> but<00:05:02.430> also<00:05:02.490> there<00:05:02.910> is

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:03.030 
RAM is a lot better but also there is

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:05.950 
RAM is a lot better but also there is
now<00:05:03.180> more<00:05:03.419> ram<00:05:03.720> in<00:05:03.990> the<00:05:04.080> machine<00:05:04.520> the<00:05:05.520> actual

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:05.960 
now more ram in the machine the actual

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:08.120 
now more ram in the machine the actual
thing<00:05:06.960> that<00:05:07.110> does<00:05:07.260> seem<00:05:07.470> to<00:05:07.530> have<00:05:07.770> increased

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:08.130 
thing that does seem to have increased

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:10.310 
thing that does seem to have increased
is<00:05:08.370> the<00:05:08.490> drive<00:05:08.760> route<00:05:09.120> speed<00:05:09.450> so<00:05:09.840> it<00:05:10.020> seems<00:05:10.229> to

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:10.320 
is the drive route speed so it seems to

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:13.040 
is the drive route speed so it seems to
have<00:05:10.500> gone<00:05:10.680> up<00:05:10.830> Bob<00:05:11.010> our<00:05:11.160> thirds<00:05:11.750> but<00:05:12.750> I<00:05:12.810> can

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:13.050 
have gone up Bob our thirds but I can

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:16.010 
have gone up Bob our thirds but I can
definitely<00:05:13.169> tell<00:05:13.560> this<00:05:13.710> Ram<00:05:14.479> makes<00:05:15.479> makes<00:05:15.840> my

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:20.490 
applications that I use in programs it's

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:23.629 
applications that I use in programs it's
a<00:05:20.550> lot<00:05:20.700> faster<00:05:21.210> to<00:05:21.240> switch<00:05:21.570> between<00:05:21.810> them<00:05:22.639> but

00:05:23.629 --> 00:05:23.639 
a lot faster to switch between them but

00:05:23.639 --> 00:05:25.370 
a lot faster to switch between them but
one<00:05:23.940> thing<00:05:24.120> I<00:05:24.180> have<00:05:24.330> also<00:05:24.510> noticed<00:05:25.139> maybe

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:25.380 
one thing I have also noticed maybe

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:26.840 
one thing I have also noticed maybe
because<00:05:25.650> it's<00:05:25.800> got<00:05:25.919> more<00:05:26.070> RAM<00:05:26.340> so<00:05:26.610> there's

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:26.850 
because it's got more RAM so there's

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:28.670 
because it's got more RAM so there's
more<00:05:27.000> memory<00:05:27.300> there<00:05:27.450> to<00:05:27.600> use<00:05:27.780> my<00:05:27.990> PC<00:05:28.650> is

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:28.680 
more memory there to use my PC is

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:31.550 
more memory there to use my PC is
actually<00:05:29.039> a<00:05:29.100> lot<00:05:29.310> quieter<00:05:29.630> so<00:05:30.630> I'm<00:05:31.320> just<00:05:31.470> gonna
