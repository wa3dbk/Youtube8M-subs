other mount to the inner red arrow by
doing<00:01:20.850> this<00:01:21.030> the<00:01:21.330> rotor<00:01:21.540> will<00:01:21.900> be<00:01:22.020> balanced<00:01:22.500> at

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
doing this the rotor will be balanced at

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:27.050 
doing this the rotor will be balanced at
around<00:01:22.979> 15<00:01:23.490> degrees<00:01:24.110> like<00:01:25.110> so<00:01:25.400> then<00:01:26.400> tighten

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
around 15 degrees like so then tighten

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.999 
around 15 degrees like so then tighten
the<00:01:27.150> two<00:01:27.299> hex<00:01:27.570> socket<00:01:27.840> bolts<00:01:28.409> on<00:01:28.560> the<00:01:28.710> top<00:01:28.890> of

the two hex socket bolts on the top of
the<00:01:29.070> rotor<00:01:29.280> so<00:01:29.970> the<00:01:30.150> pole<00:01:30.360> is<00:01:30.570> fixed<00:01:30.990> to<00:01:31.320> around

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
the rotor so the pole is fixed to around

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.810 
the rotor so the pole is fixed to around
15<00:01:32.009> degrees<00:01:33.799> once<00:01:34.799> the<00:01:35.040> pole<00:01:35.250> has<00:01:35.400> been<00:01:35.579> fixed

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
15 degrees once the pole has been fixed

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.730 
15 degrees once the pole has been fixed
to<00:01:36.030> around<00:01:36.210> 15<00:01:36.659> degrees<00:01:37.049> then<00:01:37.320> you<00:01:37.409> need<00:01:37.590> to

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
to around 15 degrees then you need to

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.740 
to around 15 degrees then you need to
realign<00:01:38.189> both<00:01:38.430> cameras<00:01:38.939> so<00:01:39.450> that<00:01:39.479> they<00:01:39.630> in<00:01:39.720> the

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
realign both cameras so that they in the

this case both camera mounts have been

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.490 
this case both camera mounts have been

at the same position at the end of the

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.249 
at the same position at the end of the
pole<00:01:57.630> then<00:01:58.409> use<00:01:59.130> the<00:01:59.340> LCD<00:01:59.969> BacPac<00:02:00.360> if<00:02:00.930> you<00:02:01.110> have

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
pole then use the LCD BacPac if you have

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:02.990 
pole then use the LCD BacPac if you have
one<00:02:01.469> to<00:02:01.649> get<00:02:01.799> the<00:02:01.890> correct<00:02:02.100> angle<00:02:02.310> on<00:02:02.790> both

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
one to get the correct angle on both

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.560 
one to get the correct angle on both
cameras<00:02:04.310> adjust<00:02:05.310> the<00:02:05.520> angle<00:02:05.850> of<00:02:05.939> both<00:02:06.119> cameras

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
cameras adjust the angle of both cameras

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.290 
cameras adjust the angle of both cameras
so<00:02:06.750> the<00:02:06.899> rotor<00:02:07.079> pole<00:02:07.409> is<00:02:07.619> not<00:02:07.799> visible<00:02:08.300> both

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
so the rotor pole is not visible both

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.960 
so the rotor pole is not visible both
cameras<00:02:09.810> must<00:02:10.020> be<00:02:10.289> adjusted<00:02:10.890> to<00:02:11.280> film<00:02:11.550> the<00:02:11.760> top

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
cameras must be adjusted to film the top

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.230 
cameras must be adjusted to film the top
of<00:02:12.090> the<00:02:12.150> helmet

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.240 
of the helmet

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:16.350 
of the helmet
if<00:02:13.300> you<00:02:13.840> don't<00:02:14.020> have<00:02:14.230> an<00:02:14.380> LCD<00:02:14.770> BacPac<00:02:15.250> then<00:02:16.240> you

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 
if you don't have an LCD BacPac then you

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.360 
if you don't have an LCD BacPac then you
will<00:02:16.450> have<00:02:16.570> to<00:02:16.720> shoot<00:02:16.900> video<00:02:17.380> watch<00:02:18.130> it<00:02:18.280> on

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370 
will have to shoot video watch it on

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:21.360 
will have to shoot video watch it on
your<00:02:18.460> PC<00:02:18.910> or<00:02:19.180> TV<00:02:19.750> and<00:02:20.020> adjust<00:02:20.860> the<00:02:20.980> camera

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
your PC or TV and adjust the camera

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:23.880 
your PC or TV and adjust the camera
until<00:02:21.730> you<00:02:21.790> get<00:02:21.940> the<00:02:22.030> right<00:02:22.180> angle<00:02:22.770> when<00:02:23.770> you

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890 
until you get the right angle when you

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:25.950 
until you get the right angle when you
film<00:02:24.130> with<00:02:24.340> the<00:02:24.460> rotor<00:02:24.640> you<00:02:25.030> will<00:02:25.570> have<00:02:25.660> video

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:25.960 
film with the rotor you will have video

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:28.500 
film with the rotor you will have video
footage<00:02:26.170> from<00:02:26.530> two<00:02:26.800> cameras<00:02:27.310> this<00:02:28.000> will<00:02:28.270> allow

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:28.510 
footage from two cameras this will allow

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:30.750 
footage from two cameras this will allow
you<00:02:28.570> to<00:02:28.750> have<00:02:29.020> a<00:02:29.080> 360<00:02:29.860> degree<00:02:30.400> view<00:02:30.430> of
