00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.190
 Hi, I would like to show you how to do this 

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:16.869
 Billiard ball you can see a previous tuto 

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:18.400
 in which he built a steel ball 

00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:21.310
 like the one he's doing in the 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:23.170
 screen if you want you can click on 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:25.540
 these legends that appear now in the 

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:27.880
 image to build both the sphere 

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:31.390
 as for example here how to do the 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:34.019
 shadow and finally even how to do 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:36.940
 in what is the background of the composition 

00:00:34.019 --> 00:00:38.739
 my name is ildefonso ensures you stay 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:40.920
 a little while and I teach you how to make the ball 

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:40.920
 billiards 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:59.469
 we are going to be placed in the layer of 

00:00:57.699 --> 00:01:01.360
 interest sphere since below we add a 

00:00:59.469 --> 00:01:03.160
 new transparent layer we select the 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:05.199
 circular selection tool for 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:07.180
 make a perfect circumference with the 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:08.950
 pressed shift key we position in 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:11.320
 the north of the sphere and with the 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:13.119
 degraded tool white to 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:16.240
 transparent we make a linear gradient 

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:18.369
 from north to south control to see 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:20.560
 select we make a transformation 

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:23.259
 free control and with the combination of 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:25.270
 control and uppercase keys from this 

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:27.399
 corner distorted to get 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:29.380
 that nice shine with the key 

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:31.030
 pressed control we will add a new 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:32.580
 layer from the icons down here that 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:34.840
 will be positioned below the previous 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:36.399
 circular selection tool with the 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:38.890
 pressed shift key we make a 

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:40.750
 perfect circumference smaller than 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:43.090
 the previous paint pot color 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:45.399
 front white we click and 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:47.649
 fill in control to remove the 

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:49.990
 text tool selection 

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:52.060
 harb is for example black color that 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:55.000
 I put here then a number for example 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:57.310
 this that size place 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.610
 for example here control t to do 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:01.930
 this larger valid and now the layer 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:03.850
 of the number and gives it a circumference 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:05.140
 white what I'm going to do is combine the 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:07.390
 so that it becomes one with the 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:10.420
 shift key selected your layers 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:11.950
 control and to combine it with the 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:15.340
 selection tool what I do is 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:18.459
 move it to a control corner t for 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:20.470
 rotate the a valid pelÃ­n and I control 

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:22.860
 click on the layer of the sphere that 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:24.819
 I had previously I'm going to filter 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:27.459
 distort 

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:31.930
 is happy to give you an amount of 100% 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:33.909
 today here ok and I would have that experience 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:35.859
 I go down here and add a mask and 

00:02:33.909 --> 00:02:38.079
 layer to remove what I have left and I go 

00:02:35.859 --> 00:02:40.120
 to merge mode and I put it in 

00:02:38.079 --> 00:02:42.969
 superimpose here would have the effect 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:44.769
 I hope you liked it 

00:02:42.969 --> 00:02:46.299
 I invite you to watch my video tutorial of how 

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:47.829
 make a steel ball by clicking the 

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:50.040
 miniature that you see on the screen up 

00:02:47.829 --> 00:02:50.040
 soon
