there's<00:02:13.170> a<00:02:13.230> few<00:02:13.440> ways<00:02:13.470> we<00:02:13.860> can<00:02:14.070> change<00:02:14.370> that

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:14.880 
there's a few ways we can change that

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:17.900 
there's a few ways we can change that
around<00:02:15.210> one<00:02:16.020> way<00:02:16.200> is<00:02:16.530> we<00:02:16.830> can<00:02:16.860> just<00:02:17.070> do<00:02:17.490> course

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
around one way is we can just do course

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:21.050 
around one way is we can just do course
review<00:02:18.650> and<00:02:19.650> this<00:02:19.890> pulls<00:02:20.160> the<00:02:20.370> lists<00:02:20.700> up<00:02:20.850> of

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
review and this pulls the lists up of

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:24.590 
review and this pulls the lists up of
our<00:02:21.600> courses<00:02:22.260> here<00:02:22.910> and<00:02:23.910> all<00:02:24.000> we<00:02:24.150> have<00:02:24.270> to<00:02:24.390> do

is<00:02:24.990> say<00:02:25.170> hey<00:02:25.200> our<00:02:26.180> spinach<00:02:27.180> salad<00:02:27.900> here<00:02:28.110> should

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:28.380 
is say hey our spinach salad here should

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:31.190 
is say hey our spinach salad here should
actually<00:02:28.590> belong<00:02:29.580> to<00:02:29.610> course<00:02:30.360> two<00:02:30.570> so<00:02:31.020> we<00:02:31.170> can

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
actually belong to course two so we can

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.530 
actually belong to course two so we can
move<00:02:31.470> it<00:02:31.590> over<00:02:31.860> now<00:02:32.670> you<00:02:32.730> see<00:02:32.970> it's<00:02:33.090> all<00:02:33.270> lined

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
move it over now you see it's all lined

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:38.840 
move it over now you see it's all lined
up<00:02:34.730> so<00:02:35.730> now<00:02:35.910> we<00:02:36.840> can<00:02:36.960> hit<00:02:37.110> done<00:02:37.440> in<00:02:38.400> this<00:02:38.520> course

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:38.850 
up so now we can hit done in this course

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:40.940 
up so now we can hit done in this course
so<00:02:39.570> everything<00:02:39.900> will<00:02:40.020> come<00:02:40.230> out<00:02:40.410> at<00:02:40.620> the

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:43.350 
correct time now there's a couple other

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:46.840 
correct time now there's a couple other
ways<00:02:43.620> we<00:02:43.890> could<00:02:44.040> actually<00:02:44.190> change<00:02:44.400> the<00:02:44.850> course

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:46.850

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:27.790 
one other thing we need to make sure is

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:32.210 
one other thing we need to make sure is
our<00:04:28.210> remote<00:04:28.840> check<00:04:29.230> format<00:04:30.120> that<00:04:31.120> we<00:04:31.270> have

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:32.220 
our remote check format that we have

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:36.120 
our remote check format that we have
separate<00:04:33.220> by<00:04:33.850> courses<00:04:34.420> selected<00:04:34.930> that<00:04:35.590> way<00:04:35.770> it

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:36.130 
separate by courses selected that way it

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:38.250 
separate by courses selected that way it
will<00:04:36.280> print<00:04:36.810> accordingly<00:04:37.810> at<00:04:37.960> the<00:04:38.080> kitchen

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:38.260 
will print accordingly at the kitchen

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:41.790 
will print accordingly at the kitchen
it'll<00:04:38.830> print<00:04:39.070> it<00:04:39.190> by<00:04:39.610> the<00:04:40.420> course<00:04:41.170> name<00:04:41.470> and

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:41.800 
it'll print it by the course name and

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:45.750 
it'll print it by the course name and
then<00:04:42.900> optionally<00:04:43.900> if<00:04:44.200> you<00:04:44.410> have<00:04:44.620> menu<00:04:45.460> items

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:45.760 
then optionally if you have menu items

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:48.660 
then optionally if you have menu items
sort<00:04:46.240> of<00:04:46.360> printed<00:04:46.900> by<00:04:47.050> priority<00:04:47.680> it<00:04:48.220> will<00:04:48.520> do

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:48.670 
sort of printed by priority it will do

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:55.050 
sort of printed by priority it will do
it<00:04:48.820> by<00:04:49.000> priority<00:04:49.600> after<00:04:49.930> that<00:04:52.410> okay<00:04:53.410> so<00:04:54.060> we

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:55.060 
it by priority after that okay so we

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:56.400 
it by priority after that okay so we
have<00:04:55.210> a<00:04:55.270> couple<00:04:55.570> more<00:04:55.870> things<00:04:56.020> that<00:04:56.170> we<00:04:56.380> need

want to say this is by default going to

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:27.840 
want to say this is by default going to
be<00:05:23.410> course<00:05:23.980> two<00:05:25.320> and<00:05:26.320> you<00:05:27.220> just<00:05:27.370> set<00:05:27.610> that<00:05:27.820> up

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:33.430 
to use coursing on it's pretty easy and

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:36.600 
to use coursing on it's pretty easy and
then<00:05:33.510> the<00:05:34.510> last<00:05:34.660> thing<00:05:34.870> we<00:05:34.960> need<00:05:35.110> to<00:05:35.140> do<00:05:35.410> is<00:05:35.650> set

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:36.610 
then the last thing we need to do is set

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:38.760 
then the last thing we need to do is set
up<00:05:36.640> our<00:05:37.000> buttons<00:05:37.750> down<00:05:37.930> here<00:05:38.290> so<00:05:38.500> we<00:05:38.620> can

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:38.770 
up our buttons down here so we can

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:41.310 
up our buttons down here so we can
review<00:05:39.100> the<00:05:39.160> courses<00:05:39.700> and<00:05:40.000> make<00:05:40.750> any<00:05:41.020> kind<00:05:41.200> of

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:41.320 
review the courses and make any kind of

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:44.170 
changes that we may need so let's take a

00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:47.490 
changes that we may need so let's take a
look<00:05:44.440> at<00:05:44.560> the<00:05:44.710> course<00:05:44.980> review<00:05:45.220> button<00:05:46.500> it's

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:47.500 
look at the course review button it's

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:51.360 
look at the course review button it's
actually<00:05:47.860> a<00:05:48.070> package<00:05:49.020> so<00:05:50.020> we<00:05:50.500> will<00:05:50.830> open<00:05:51.220> up

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:51.370 
actually a package so we will open up

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:54.150 
actually a package so we will open up
our<00:05:51.810> packages<00:05:52.810> here<00:05:53.110> directly<00:05:53.830> from<00:05:53.920> the

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:54.160 
our packages here directly from the

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:57.150 
our packages here directly from the
canvas<00:05:54.870> alternatively<00:05:55.870> you<00:05:56.350> can<00:05:56.530> go<00:05:56.590> to<00:05:56.770> order

00:05:57.150 --> 00:05:57.160 
canvas alternatively you can go to order

00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:00.620 
canvas alternatively you can go to order
entry<00:05:57.720> packages<00:05:58.720> and<00:05:58.960> see<00:05:59.500> the<00:05:59.620> same<00:05:59.830> screen

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:00.630 
entry packages and see the same screen

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:05.070 
entry packages and see the same screen
so<00:06:01.630> our<00:06:01.930> course<00:06:02.350> review<00:06:03.010> command<00:06:03.900> package<00:06:04.900> is

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:05.080 
so our course review command package is

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:08.280 
so our course review command package is
actually<00:06:05.770> just<00:06:06.100> on<00:06:06.430> type<00:06:07.420> one<00:06:07.630> it's<00:06:07.810> a<00:06:07.900> command

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:08.290 
actually just on type one it's a command

00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:12.450 
actually just on type one it's a command
and<00:06:08.470> the<00:06:08.950> item<00:06:09.310> is<00:06:10.170> named<00:06:11.170> course<00:06:11.800> review

00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:12.460 
and the item is named course review

and the item is named course review
that's<00:06:13.150> all<00:06:13.360> the<00:06:13.510> settings<00:06:13.840> for<00:06:13.990> that<00:06:14.170> and

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:15.040 
that's all the settings for that and

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:17.400 
that's all the settings for that and
that<00:06:15.190> obviously<00:06:15.580> will<00:06:16.090> bring<00:06:16.300> up<00:06:16.480> the<00:06:16.750> course

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:17.410 
that obviously will bring up the course

00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:19.470 
that obviously will bring up the course
review<00:06:17.620> window<00:06:18.160> where<00:06:18.820> you<00:06:18.850> can<00:06:18.940> just<00:06:19.270> move
