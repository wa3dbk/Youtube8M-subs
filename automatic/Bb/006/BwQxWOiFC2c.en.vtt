of sugar just mix it well to ensure that
the<00:02:12.760> sugar<00:02:13.000> is<00:02:13.180> completely<00:02:13.630> dissolved<00:02:14.470> in

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:15.100 
the sugar is completely dissolved in

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:18.540 
the sugar is completely dissolved in
this<00:02:15.310> and<00:02:15.840> also<00:02:16.840> to<00:02:17.290> make<00:02:17.500> a<00:02:17.530> lump<00:02:17.980> free<00:02:18.250> batter

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:18.550 
this and also to make a lump free batter

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:22.260 
this and also to make a lump free batter
and<00:02:19.140> now<00:02:20.140> add<00:02:21.040> this<00:02:21.400> mixture<00:02:21.640> into<00:02:22.120> a

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:22.270 
and now add this mixture into a

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:24.840 
and now add this mixture into a
non-stick<00:02:22.930> pan<00:02:23.260> and<00:02:23.590> place<00:02:23.890> that<00:02:23.980> pan<00:02:24.460> over

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:28.660 
your stove with the flame at low so your

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:30.720 
your stove with the flame at low so your
flame<00:02:28.960> should<00:02:29.200> be<00:02:29.410> kept<00:02:29.740> on<00:02:29.920> low<00:02:30.220> throughout

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730 
flame should be kept on low throughout

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:32.940 
flame should be kept on low throughout
the<00:02:31.000> process<00:02:31.210> of<00:02:31.600> making<00:02:31.900> this<00:02:32.320> followed<00:02:32.800> a

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950 
the process of making this followed a

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:35.580 
the process of making this followed a
safe<00:02:33.280> so<00:02:34.150> you<00:02:34.240> have<00:02:34.420> to<00:02:34.570> continue<00:02:35.080> cook<00:02:35.350> it

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.590 
safe so you have to continue cook it

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:39.840 
safe so you have to continue cook it
till<00:02:35.860> this<00:02:36.040> mixture<00:02:36.520> become<00:02:36.940> thickened<00:02:38.850> so

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:39.850 
till this mixture become thickened so

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:43.500 
till this mixture become thickened so
I'm<00:02:39.910> just<00:02:40.060> going<00:02:40.330> to<00:02:40.450> cook<00:02:40.840> it<00:02:41.140> so<00:02:42.060> use<00:02:43.060> a<00:02:43.090> small

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:43.510 
I'm just going to cook it so use a small

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:47.370 
I'm just going to cook it so use a small
burner<00:02:43.870> and<00:02:44.260> keep<00:02:44.680> your<00:02:44.860> flame<00:02:45.160> at<00:02:45.370> low<00:02:45.960> so<00:02:46.960> and

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:53.860 
the mixture to avoid it from burning at

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:56.490 
the mixture to avoid it from burning at
the<00:02:54.010> bottom<00:02:54.430> or<00:02:54.670> it<00:02:55.420> should<00:02:55.690> not<00:02:55.810> stick<00:02:56.170> at<00:02:56.350> the
