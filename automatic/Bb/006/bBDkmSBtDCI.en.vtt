where we can do a lot more the crew is
actually<00:00:49.950> a<00:00:49.980> game<00:00:50.460> that<00:00:51.329> seems<00:00:51.809> pretty<00:00:52.170> cool

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
actually a game that seems pretty cool

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.869 
actually a game that seems pretty cool

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
for the pc ps4 and xbox one so it's

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:06.920 
for the pc ps4 and xbox one so it's
going<00:01:01.770> to<00:01:01.890> be<00:01:01.980> a<00:01:02.010> pretty<00:01:02.520> big<00:01:02.850> game<00:01:05.540> but<00:01:06.540> this

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
going to be a pretty big game but this

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.810 
going to be a pretty big game but this
is<00:01:07.170> something<00:01:07.409> that<00:01:07.830> I<00:01:08.220> wanted<00:01:08.460> to<00:01:08.549> talk<00:01:08.700> about

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
is something that I wanted to talk about

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.510 
is something that I wanted to talk about
I<00:01:09.000> think<00:01:09.360> maybe<00:01:10.049> watchdogs<00:01:10.860> was<00:01:11.100> the<00:01:11.250> first

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
I think maybe watchdogs was the first

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.870 
I think maybe watchdogs was the first
true<00:01:11.909> game<00:01:12.180> that<00:01:12.930> was<00:01:13.590> set<00:01:14.010> up<00:01:14.130> to<00:01:14.159> be<00:01:14.369> used<00:01:14.610> for

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
true game that was set up to be used for

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.380 
true game that was set up to be used for
the<00:01:14.909> next<00:01:15.299> gen<00:01:15.509> consoles<00:01:16.520> maybe<00:01:17.520> Ubisoft<00:01:18.240> be

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
the next gen consoles maybe Ubisoft be

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.560 
the next gen consoles maybe Ubisoft be
to<00:01:18.450> put<00:01:19.020> a<00:01:19.049> bit<00:01:19.290> too<00:01:19.439> much<00:01:19.560> behind<00:01:19.799> it

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:20.570 
to put a bit too much behind it

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:22.820 
to put a bit too much behind it
originally<00:01:21.570> made<00:01:21.750> it<00:01:21.900> a<00:01:21.930> bit<00:01:22.110> too<00:01:22.140> more

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
originally made it a bit too more

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.240 
originally made it a bit too more
graphically<00:01:23.250> enhanced<00:01:24.229> then<00:01:25.229> they<00:01:25.439> wanted<00:01:26.070> to

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
graphically enhanced then they wanted to

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.219 
graphically enhanced then they wanted to
I<00:01:26.280> think<00:01:26.610> originally<00:01:27.479> they<00:01:27.840> were<00:01:27.869> trying<00:01:28.080> to

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
I think originally they were trying to

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.469 
I think originally they were trying to
make<00:01:28.259> it<00:01:28.439> like<00:01:28.560> a<00:01:28.590> really<00:01:28.890> good<00:01:29.189> pc<00:01:29.820> game<00:01:30.150> and

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
make it like a really good pc game and

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.539 
make it like a really good pc game and
then<00:01:31.170> the<00:01:31.290> next<00:01:31.409> generation<00:01:31.920> consoles<00:01:32.400> came

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
then the next generation consoles came

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:33.890 
then the next generation consoles came
along<00:01:32.790> and<00:01:32.909> they<00:01:33.000> saw<00:01:33.180> that<00:01:33.210> it<00:01:33.509> could<00:01:33.630> handle

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
along and they saw that it could handle

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.510 
along and they saw that it could handle
it<00:01:34.140> that<00:01:34.500> the<00:01:34.590> job<00:01:34.890> will<00:01:35.130> put<00:01:35.280> it<00:01:35.369> on<00:01:35.430> the

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
it that the job will put it on the

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.050 
it that the job will put it on the
consoles<00:01:35.880> as<00:01:36.000> well<00:01:37.490> but<00:01:38.490> this<00:01:38.549> is<00:01:38.850> something

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
consoles as well but this is something

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.120 
consoles as well but this is something
that<00:01:39.270> I<00:01:39.540> wanted<00:01:39.750> to<00:01:39.810> talk<00:01:39.960> about<00:01:39.990> a<00:01:40.439> lot<00:01:41.009> of
