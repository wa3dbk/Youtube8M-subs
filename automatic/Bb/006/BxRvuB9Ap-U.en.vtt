00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:14.650
 the celestial choir the heavenly choir 

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:22.190
 the choir of the girls of a new girlfriend 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:24.500
 I'm not like to head that choir 

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:26.600
 It takes my dear Rachel days 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:28.730
 to communicate immediately with her 

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:30.380
 so that we can present this again 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:31.880
 second part of that great interview that 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:33.579
 you did michelle obama how are you 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:35.920
 girlfriend 

00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:37.870
 girls is look friends I'm 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:40.179
 dying of cold you do not see how 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:42.129
 it hits the snow but it does not matter how 

00:00:40.179 --> 00:00:43.719
 you know this first part of the 

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:46.719
 interview with michelle obama the first 

00:00:43.719 --> 00:00:49.059
 lady of the USA we ended up asking her 

00:00:46.719 --> 00:00:50.589
 that we women are the head 

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:52.809
 of the family we really are the ones 

00:00:50.589 --> 00:00:54.909
 we buy the market we decide 

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:56.920
 if you eat healthy or not and how much 

00:00:54.909 --> 00:00:59.530
 important was for her as the first 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:01.059
 lady sit the whole family together 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:03.869
 to the same table and this was what 

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:03.869
 replied let's see 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:10.550
 and that is extremely important for 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:12.470
 that families look for that time that 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:14.690
 time during the week and if not what 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:17.690
 can every day maybe sometime 

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:19.670
 sit down as a family at the table that's 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:21.860
 something that our cultures share 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:24.470
 food is the most important part of 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:28.370
 day is when we are not only 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:31.400
 breaking the bread but we share what 

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:34.160
 It happened on the day people laugh 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:36.800
 Children need that attention too 

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:38.720
 that concentrate is separated only in 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:40.280
 the food and concentrate rather on the 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:42.410
 family instead of choking on the 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:44.570
 food in front of the television 

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:46.970
 families realize that they eat more 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:49.160
 they slowly have conversations about 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:51.500
 of health without having to be a sermon 

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:53.990
 they come out naturally and share 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:56.330
 special moments so the food 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:58.940
 Family is far more important than 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:00.470
 that we could imagine our already 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:03.170
 our parents and our grandparents 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:05.119
 they knew about that intrinsically and 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:07.729
 inter and interesting to know what they knew 

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:09.770
 they instinctively do not the woman 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:13.460
 nowadays we are able to do many 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:16.220
 at the same time we are work we are 

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:19.130
 wives we are mothers we raise children 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:21.350
 we do tasks what would be the best 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:24.430
 advice because you are an example of 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:26.930
 what could I give to those mothers 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:29.840
 specifically Latinas so that 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:32.560
 achieve a balance between all those areas 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:35.630
 exxon in question that is a question 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:38.090
 excellent and I usually do it where 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:41.210
 I want to go things that I tell the 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:44.150
 bad African-American and Latina women 

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:46.070
 also what I want you to know is that 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:48.250
 we have to take care of ourselves 

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:50.860
 ourselves 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:53.740
 we can not feel afraid or 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:56.290
 feel guilty or think we are 

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:57.970
 selfish because we take time to 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:02.130
 we ourselves because we are the 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:04.680
 first model of our children 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:07.080
 they have to see that we eat from 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:09.060
 healthy way we exercise 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:11.790
 on a regular basis 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:13.500
 they have to also see that 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:15.480
 we love ourselves 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:18.420
 and that we are happy with who 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:21.120
 we are and are sure of ourselves and that 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:22.739
 we attract positive relationships to our 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:25.920
 lives because they learn from us 

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:29.599
 our children learn from us they see 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:29.599
 everything we do 

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:34.180
 because they're going to see us as a model for 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:36.480
 know what kind of woman they want to be in 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:39.360
 the future 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:42.200
 now recently we saw her sorry 

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:45.840

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:49.410
 highlander is loved as bailo 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:50.040
 perhaps dancing an exercise routine 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:52.830
 for you 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:55.190

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:05.220
 made shadow when we leave 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:07.709
 vacation if it's mainly 

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:09.780
 of the instructor and the music truth what 

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:11.849
 vibrant that is the music that changes 

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:14.819
 everything but zumba is a good way to 

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:16.620
 become active becoming active and 

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:19.680
 Being in shape is not just about going 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:22.200
 to the gym and lifting weights or running in 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:24.510

 Fallon wanted to tell parents that 

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:34.070
