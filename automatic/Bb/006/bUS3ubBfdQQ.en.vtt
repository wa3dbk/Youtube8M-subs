felt it's not really mod but I put some
felt<00:01:05.189> on<00:01:05.790> the<00:01:06.360> bolt<00:01:06.570> on<00:01:07.049> both<00:01:07.290> sides<00:01:07.560> of<00:01:07.680> the

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
felt on the bolt on both sides of the

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.160 
felt on the bolt on both sides of the
bolt<00:01:08.040> so<00:01:08.909> it<00:01:09.090> and<00:01:09.180> scratch<00:01:09.479> up<00:01:09.689> the<00:01:09.720> bare

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170

wooden<00:01:10.530> scuff<00:01:11.040> the<00:01:11.189> paint<00:01:11.750> on<00:01:12.750> there<00:01:13.020> so<00:01:13.950> I

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
wooden scuff the paint on there so I

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:17.090 
wooden scuff the paint on there so I
thought<00:01:14.220> that<00:01:14.400> was<00:01:14.520> pretty<00:01:14.780> pretty<00:01:15.830> it<00:01:16.830> was<00:01:17.040> a

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
thought that was pretty pretty it was a

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:25.100 
thought that was pretty pretty it was a
good<00:01:17.189> idea<00:01:18.080> as<00:01:19.080> well<00:01:19.470> as<00:01:19.710> a<00:01:20.119> lock<00:01:21.119> stop<00:01:23.780> so<00:01:24.780> yeah

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
good idea as well as a lock stop so yeah

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.880 
good idea as well as a lock stop so yeah
and<00:01:25.460> these<00:01:26.460> are<00:01:26.729> rubber<00:01:27.000> bands<00:01:27.450> and<00:01:27.890> the

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
and these are rubber bands and the

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.319 
and these are rubber bands and the
reason<00:01:29.189> I<00:01:29.220> put<00:01:29.369> those<00:01:29.490> on<00:01:29.700> theirs<00:01:29.909> because<00:01:30.090> I

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
reason I put those on theirs because I

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:33.200 
reason I put those on theirs because I
didn't<00:01:30.630> have<00:01:30.750> enough<00:01:30.930> screws<00:01:31.320> and<00:01:31.790> well<00:01:32.790> I<00:01:32.820> did

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
didn't have enough screws and well I did

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.770 
didn't have enough screws and well I did
have<00:01:33.240> enough<00:01:33.659> screws<00:01:34.040> but<00:01:35.360> they<00:01:36.360> were<00:01:36.420> all

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
have enough screws but they were all

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.319 
have enough screws but they were all
stripped<00:01:37.229> out<00:01:37.380> because<00:01:37.920> I'd<00:01:38.130> unscrewed<00:01:38.759> it<00:01:38.790> so

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
stripped out because I'd unscrewed it so

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:43.850 
stripped out because I'd unscrewed it so
many<00:01:39.479> times<00:01:39.600> so<00:01:41.150> yeah<00:01:42.150> I<00:01:42.329> think<00:01:42.439> for<00:01:43.439> my<00:01:43.590> first

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
many times so yeah I think for my first

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.999 
many times so yeah I think for my first
light<00:01:44.490> paint<00:01:44.909> job<00:01:45.180> I<00:01:45.479> did<00:01:46.409> a<00:01:46.439> pretty<00:01:46.770> good<00:01:46.950> job

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
light paint job I did a pretty good job

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:50.270 
light paint job I did a pretty good job
I<00:01:47.549> mean<00:01:48.149> I<00:01:48.329> used<00:01:48.360> it<00:01:48.720> I<00:01:48.750> used<00:01:49.290> a<00:01:49.409> base<00:01:49.740> coat<00:01:50.040> of

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
I mean I used it I used a base coat of

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:56.300 
I mean I used it I used a base coat of
like<00:01:51.000> a<00:01:51.030> tannish<00:01:51.630> color<00:01:52.700> and<00:01:54.259> then<00:01:55.259> the<00:01:55.649> with

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
like a tannish color and then the with

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.510 
like a tannish color and then the with
black<00:01:56.700> and<00:01:57.090> then<00:01:57.270> silver<00:01:58.040> screws<00:01:59.040> and<00:01:59.280> bolts

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:04.069 
black and then silver screws and bolts
and<00:01:59.850> whatever<00:02:00.979> so<00:02:01.979> I<00:02:02.040> think<00:02:02.490> it's<00:02:02.700> a<00:02:03.079> really

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079
