so I am 28 going on 29 right now I've

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:38.340 
so I am 28 going on 29 right now I've
started<00:00:35.260> having<00:00:35.980> procedures<00:00:37.080> when<00:00:38.080> I<00:00:38.110> was

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:38.350 
started having procedures when I was

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:43.140 
started having procedures when I was
around<00:00:38.760> 24<00:00:39.760> 25<00:00:40.300> I<00:00:40.720> believe<00:00:41.489> my<00:00:42.489> first<00:00:42.700> two<00:00:42.970> were

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:43.150 
around 24 25 I believe my first two were

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:45.450 
around 24 25 I believe my first two were
the<00:00:43.360> linear<00:00:43.690> procedures<00:00:44.320> and<00:00:44.650> the<00:00:44.770> third<00:00:45.040> was

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:45.460 
the linear procedures and the third was

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:50.130 
the linear procedures and the third was
with<00:00:45.610> the<00:00:45.730> artists<00:00:46.180> and<00:00:48.059> quite<00:00:49.059> frankly<00:00:49.330> I<00:00:49.570> I

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:50.140 
with the artists and quite frankly I I

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:53.250 
with the artists and quite frankly I I
don't<00:00:50.500> trust<00:00:50.980> anybody<00:00:51.340> more<00:00:51.760> with<00:00:52.570> my<00:00:52.840> hair

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:53.260 
don't trust anybody more with my hair

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:56.790 
don't trust anybody more with my hair
than<00:00:53.650> Doc<00:00:54.040> Anderson<00:00:54.870> and<00:00:55.870> I<00:00:56.140> trust<00:00:56.530> his

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:56.800 
than Doc Anderson and I trust his

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:59.040 
than Doc Anderson and I trust his
guidance<00:00:57.250> and<00:00:57.550> when<00:00:57.940> he<00:00:58.059> says<00:00:58.360> that<00:00:58.720> the

00:00:59.040 --> 00:00:59.050 
guidance and when he says that the

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:01.380 
guidance and when he says that the
artist<00:00:59.230> is<00:00:59.530> the<00:00:59.589> best<00:00:59.949> thing<00:01:00.220> out<00:01:00.370> there<00:01:00.670> did

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:01.390 
artist is the best thing out there did

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:04.700 
artist is the best thing out there did
my<00:01:01.570> research<00:01:02.230> and<00:01:02.530> that<00:01:02.949> corroborated<00:01:03.699> that

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
my research and that corroborated that

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.250 
my research and that corroborated that
significantly<00:01:05.710> so<00:01:06.130> when<00:01:06.760> he<00:01:06.880> said<00:01:07.120> that<00:01:07.420> he

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:08.260 
significantly so when he said that he

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:12.240 
significantly so when he said that he
had<00:01:08.409> the<00:01:08.560> new<00:01:08.770> the<00:01:09.190> new<00:01:09.340> machine<00:01:09.729> in<00:01:09.970> I<00:01:11.250> decided

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:12.250 
had the new the new machine in I decided

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:14.100 
had the new the new machine in I decided
that<00:01:12.430> that<00:01:12.580> was<00:01:12.940> uh<00:01:12.970> that<00:01:13.390> was<00:01:13.570> the<00:01:13.690> next<00:01:13.990> one

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:14.110 
that that was uh that was the next one

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:16.980 
that that was uh that was the next one
just<00:01:14.500> to<00:01:14.590> try<00:01:14.800> something<00:01:15.220> new<00:01:15.250> to<00:01:15.790> make<00:01:16.720> the

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:16.990 
just to try something new to make the

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:19.170 
just to try something new to make the
mitigate<00:01:17.560> some<00:01:17.710> of<00:01:17.770> the<00:01:18.100> the<00:01:18.700> downtime

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:19.180 
mitigate some of the the downtime

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:22.920 
mitigate some of the the downtime
mitigate<00:01:19.630> some<00:01:19.840> of<00:01:19.900> the<00:01:20.140> recovery<00:01:20.470> time<00:01:21.930> I've

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:22.930 
mitigate some of the recovery time I've

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:26.039 
mitigate some of the recovery time I've
already<00:01:23.229> got<00:01:23.380> two<00:01:23.860> scars<00:01:24.400> so<00:01:24.850> I<00:01:25.049> wasn't

00:01:26.039 --> 00:01:26.049 
already got two scars so I wasn't

00:01:26.049 --> 00:01:30.930 
already got two scars so I wasn't
necessarily<00:01:26.700> keen<00:01:27.700> on<00:01:28.090> having<00:01:28.510> a<00:01:28.780> third<00:01:29.940> the

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:30.940 
necessarily keen on having a third the

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:32.429 
necessarily keen on having a third the
third<00:01:31.180> scar<00:01:31.479> even<00:01:31.750> though<00:01:31.869> they're<00:01:32.079> minimal

00:01:32.429 --> 00:01:32.439 
third scar even though they're minimal

00:01:32.439 --> 00:01:33.870 
third scar even though they're minimal
and<00:01:32.649> you<00:01:32.710> keep<00:01:32.890> your<00:01:33.009> hair<00:01:33.159> long<00:01:33.399> you<00:01:33.640> can't
