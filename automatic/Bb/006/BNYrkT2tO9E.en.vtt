00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
 good guys this day let's see two 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:06.120
 great applications to be able to see 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:08.460
 Netflix type movies but one 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.870
 totally free way comfortable because 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.969
 really when we look for movies 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.590
 online simply or most times 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:15.120
 we found a lot of publicity or 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.070
 simply the movies are not seen in 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.980
 hd in this case we are going to put them coming 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:22.170
 until the up in 1080p if you're 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.689
 like so up to 720p and you can 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.630
 set up but hey guys now let's go 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:35.100
 with the video 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:35.100
 [Music] 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:43.580
 [Music] 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:45.500
 the boys once we have already 

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:47.450
 seen the introduction and all that 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:49.610
 guide well let's have two options 

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:51.470
 to download here I mean with this 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:53.660
 there are two applications houses totally 

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:56.060
 similar but obviously they are different 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:57.500
 how are richard good expenses 

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:58.910
 they have movies the two are very 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:00.950
 similar but I'm going to show you 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:03.710
 a crown first I'm going to show you this 

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:05.420
 which is cuevana is an application that 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:07.190
 I really like it more than this one but 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:08.840
 I tell him we're going to see both of us 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:10.520
 enter here obviously is the 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:12.530
 I leave in the description of the video and a 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:14.600
 Once we are there we are going to lower everything 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:16.640
 this until not only this menu says 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.240
 download of the beta version is now 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:18.770
 free 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:20.330
 I prefer to download the beta for 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:21.710
 windows because obviously I have windows 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:24.619
 and you have another operating system 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:27.470
 obviously the movies you click here and 

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:29.119
 is going to take you to mega this is already coming 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:31.070
 saying we 're going to do we're not going to 

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:32.210
 expect to download a file that weighs 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:35.119
 almost 30 megs 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:37.190
 we give in download and then once 

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:39.020
 downloaded will be installed as 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:40.700
 any kind of program we are not going to 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:42.680
 do it they will install with the typical 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:44.960
 next next next next 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:45.630
 until obviously they just load them 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.460
 good 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.590
 once I have installed, I repeat that 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:53.670
 it's super easy they're going to get an icon 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:55.350
 here cuevana store did not know there was 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.570
 installed I repeat it's totally easy 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.340
 but now the only thing that needs to be done is 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.390
 the one with two clicks for those who will not know 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.909
 what is the application 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:05.680
 has virus does not have friends of 

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:07.510
 advertising I think you have not seen any 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:09.520
 type of advertising investment but 

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:10.810
 Well let's put the screen is but 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:12.370
 he is recording because then problems 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:14.920
 with other applications on the screen 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:17.230
 complete but you can see that the 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:20.050
 Spanish interface almost all the 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:21.640
 movies are in English but that's the 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:23.380
 only problem we can find but 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:26.260
 it's a small problem because all 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:28.540
 they are translated but you can 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:30.190
 see you in 1080 to 720p now I'm going to 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:31.780
 show is more or less they can go to 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:34.250
 ends that are obviously the 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:38.030
 external with the mouse wheel 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:41.420
 You can change it also visits 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:44.330
 of the desk because the most 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:49.190
 popular of the month come categorized 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:50.630
 in this way today here I had the up 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:53.300
 okay 

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:55.550
 can see how great in 3d movies 

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:57.380
 and all this rating here we have more and 

00:02:55.550 --> 00:03:00.280
 more than happens maybe you want to look for a 

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:03.050
 movie does not want to look maybe those of 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:06.680
 residents in pakistan 

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:08.300
 we have the extinction the generation of 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:15.050
 which is generally that of receive 4 

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:17.900
 good the game an apocalypse 

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:19.430
 and good mex layer in all that wants 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:21.080
 tell us that there is a lot of 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:23.680
 movies actually for example 

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:23.680
 we want truth 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:27.569
 but we give him here and he will leave us his 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:30.030
 information as you can see from here 

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:31.349
 we are already seeing everything very well already 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:33.290
 tells us that here is in the language in 

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:39.000
 English but is subtitled in Spanish 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:40.890
 we are going to reproduce that we can load the 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.959
 720p video is a bit weird 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:45.269
 because almost all have 1080p but 

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:47.010
 well let's see in 720p that equal 

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:48.569
 so it's very good there is that says 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:50.370
 please wait loading the torrent 

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:51.750
 but start playing now 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:52.500
 tell me about richter what is this that I'm 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:55.049
 downloading 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:56.280
 I do not want is to download good garbage 

00:03:55.049 --> 00:03:57.510
 for those who do not know the 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:59.370
 torrents because they are the archives the 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:01.650
 which allows you to filter some downloads 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:04.170
 so that they are not eliminated in a 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:06.150
 moment can be fast not so it's 

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:07.920
 a little more a little less so much 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:09.209
 but it's a little bit slower than not 

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:11.250
 normal but you can see that I want 

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:13.920
 we have no problem besides not 

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:16.370
 We are looking at 720p and we have already started the 

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:16.370
 movie 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:21.000
 as you can see it looks super good and that 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:23.760
 that are 720 I was in 1080 then 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.590
 obviously they will see it much better at 

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:27.540
 better instruction to see with total then 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:29.310
 change or this is for this because 

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:31.530
 well that also depends a lot on your 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:33.660
 internet of you because obviously it's 

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:35.400
 Internet is very slow because it's going to 

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:37.410
 take a long time to load the movie 

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:39.570
 if your internal is a little faster 

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:40.740
 obviously it's going to be faster 

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:42.630
 I believe who they are in any kind of 

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:45.720
 problem and here we are already seeing the 

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:47.220
 movie without any problem ok 

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:49.440
 I do not leave anymore because being already know that 

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:50.880
 is the subject of copyright, so 

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:53.220
 this would be 

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:56.449
 Video output ground 

00:04:53.220 --> 00:05:00.050
 this would be that type d 

00:04:56.449 --> 00:05:01.849
 of application of the program here we can 

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:04.400
 of the titles adjustments but go outside 

00:05:01.849 --> 00:05:06.469
 nothing else and I say it's really 

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:08.210
 better than this netflix seriously and it's 

00:05:06.469 --> 00:05:10.669
 totally free as you can see no me 

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:13.309
 asked to register or anything now with the 

00:05:10.669 --> 00:05:15.259
 another page that I say the same but I 

00:05:13.309 --> 00:05:17.300
 I recommend more the other one that is because I 

00:05:15.259 --> 00:05:19.370
 I recommend them more is the cave 

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:20.960
 which is called cuevana is popcorn 

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:22.400
 because then you do not want more is more 

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:24.529
 comfortable but the inter flag is 

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:26.360
 completely the same the discharge the 

00:05:24.529 --> 00:05:28.339
 download install once done that 

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:31.550
 then I will leave you an icon in the 

00:05:28.339 --> 00:05:33.259
 desktop let's open it and here we 

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:35.270
 So, more movies are coming out here 

00:05:33.259 --> 00:05:37.189
 if it is with the mouse with this 

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:38.950
 mouse but good here we have the below 

00:05:37.189 --> 00:05:41.370
 from the same star 

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:43.949
 I'm going to see it 

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:45.960
 but equally I say but to me 

00:05:43.949 --> 00:05:49.050
 like more than the other application all 

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:50.699
 more organized I do not know but it's the same 

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:51.300
 just the same here we play comedy 

00:05:50.699 --> 00:05:53.550
 music 

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:55.310
 terror and everything but for example to me 

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:57.540
 take longer to load here I do not know very well 

00:05:55.310 --> 00:06:00.350
 here you are going to look for murderous 

00:05:57.540 --> 00:06:00.350
 They are also 

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:10.260
 since they 're all the same, I do not know if 

00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:12.440
 really come from the same towers 

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:15.360
 but good for example you will see be 

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:17.520
 here we can see in 1080 you can see and 

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:19.529
 we are going to give you in seeing there will be 720p for 

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:21.329
 It does not take long to load 

00:06:19.529 --> 00:06:22.650
 as you can see here is already saying the 

00:06:21.329 --> 00:06:25.680
 discharge 

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:28.110
 starting the download ok 

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:30.100
 but I see how it goes more here good if 

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:34.120
 I carried everyday things 

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:35.770
 have just 3% after what I say 

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:37.330
 that I do not like much is also that 

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:39.970
 let's be a little heavier invested 

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:41.530
 with more resources and apart because I was not 

00:06:39.970 --> 00:06:43.180
 very well organized as the other good 

00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:44.890
 according to me but obviously you can 

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:47.110
 try not to start much better than you weigh 

00:06:44.890 --> 00:06:49.720
 30 megabytes or so and the other 

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:51.970
 company 50 megabytes more or less so 

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:55.560
 good game see that it looks really good as well 

00:06:51.970 --> 00:06:55.560
 what do i imagine bichi 

00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:08.680
 the other to 4% 5% to 6% recovering for 

00:07:06.319 --> 00:07:10.880
 who ask me when this 

00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:13.490
 internet and richard 2000 internet is 

00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:15.770
 10 megabytes more or less every second 

00:07:13.490 --> 00:07:18.259
 I am downloading 1200 kilobytes for 

00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:20.150
 second so it's a little bit powerful and a 

00:07:18.259 --> 00:07:21.889
 little new and here they start 

00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:23.240
 receive a little bit faster but if 

00:07:21.889 --> 00:07:24.889
 it takes a bit of guys and truthfully I 

00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:26.090
 yes i see it takes longer to load but 

00:07:24.889 --> 00:07:30.370
 good 

00:07:26.090 --> 00:07:30.370
 78 69 100 

00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:33.870
 all right 

00:07:31.630 --> 00:07:34.830
 [Music] 

00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:36.830
 for this 

00:07:34.830 --> 00:07:39.680
 [Music] 

00:07:36.830 --> 00:07:40.700
 is downloading at 500 624 kilobytes per 

00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:42.020
 second 

00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:44.210
 that is, more or less if they want to load
