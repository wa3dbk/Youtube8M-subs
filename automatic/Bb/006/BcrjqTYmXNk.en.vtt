same prices I've looked it up on ps3 but
that's<00:01:23.580> only<00:01:23.850> at<00:01:24.330> the<00:01:24.540> moment<00:01:24.930> so<00:01:24.990> i'm<00:01:25.890> going

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
that's only at the moment so i'm going

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.850 
that's only at the moment so i'm going
to<00:01:26.130> pick<00:01:26.220> my<00:01:26.430> maximum<00:01:26.880> price<00:01:27.150> at<00:01:27.479> 6k<00:01:28.470> and<00:01:28.770> i'm

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
also going to put my minimum price

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.420 
also going to put my minimum price
because<00:01:30.390> they're<00:01:30.509> actually<00:01:31.049> really<00:01:31.280> hard<00:01:32.280> to

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
because they're actually really hard to

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.120 
because they're actually really hard to
find<00:01:32.700> so<00:01:33.180> the<00:01:33.570> downfall<00:01:34.140> of<00:01:34.170> this<00:01:34.619> is<00:01:34.920> it's

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
find so the downfall of this is it's

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.550 
find so the downfall of this is it's
really<00:01:35.430> really<00:01:35.880> quite<00:01:36.240> hard<00:01:36.509> to<00:01:36.960> find<00:01:37.320> them

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
really really quite hard to find them

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:38.899 
really really quite hard to find them
like<00:01:37.799> once<00:01:37.920> you<00:01:38.100> find<00:01:38.340> that<00:01:38.400> it's<00:01:38.579> not<00:01:38.670> too

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
like once you find that it's not too

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.359 
like once you find that it's not too
hard<00:01:39.180> to<00:01:39.270> win<00:01:39.450> bids<00:01:39.720> but<00:01:40.500> there<00:01:40.890> aren't<00:01:41.100> that

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
hard to win bids but there aren't that

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.249 
hard to win bids but there aren't that
many<00:01:41.430> of<00:01:41.729> them<00:01:42.000> and<00:01:42.240> i<00:01:42.329> and<00:01:42.630> i<00:01:42.689> probably<00:01:42.930> put

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
many of them and i and i probably put

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.530 
many of them and i and i probably put
the<00:01:43.290> price<00:01:43.590> too<00:01:43.740> high<00:01:43.850> but<00:01:44.850> hey<00:01:45.180> it<00:01:45.360> doesn't

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
the price too high but hey it doesn't

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.310 
the price too high but hey it doesn't
really<00:01:45.780> matter<00:01:46.020> so<00:01:47.659> yeah<00:01:48.659> as<00:01:48.869> you<00:01:49.020> can<00:01:49.049> see

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
really matter so yeah as you can see

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.170 
really matter so yeah as you can see
it's<00:01:49.560> quite<00:01:50.070> hot<00:01:50.220> spot<00:01:50.490> the<00:01:50.610> Mon<00:01:50.759> I'm<00:01:51.000> actually

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
to scroll through pages and pages just

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.490 
to scroll through pages and pages just
find<00:02:02.700> one<00:02:02.939> that<00:02:03.719> is<00:02:03.869> the<00:02:04.049> only<00:02:04.170> bad<00:02:04.469> thing

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
lot of time then this is a really good

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.029 
lot of time then this is a really good
method<00:02:09.149> to<00:02:09.330> get<00:02:10.170> a<00:02:10.200> lot<00:02:10.500> of<00:02:10.530> profit<00:02:10.830> I'm

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:49.460 
good one grand profit just / for each
card<00:03:47.400> so<00:03:47.700> if<00:03:47.850> you're<00:03:48.000> doing<00:03:48.360> 14-hour<00:03:49.200> you

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:49.470 
card so if you're doing 14-hour you

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:51.830 
card so if you're doing 14-hour you
could<00:03:49.620> probably<00:03:49.860> earn<00:03:50.180> up<00:03:51.180> to<00:03:51.239> if<00:03:51.600> you're<00:03:51.750> only

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840 
could probably earn up to if you're only

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:53.570 
could probably earn up to if you're only
one<00:03:52.110> round<00:03:52.350> each<00:03:52.470> cordoning<00:03:53.010> 40<00:03:53.340> now<00:03:53.519> you

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:53.580 
one round each cordoning 40 now you

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:56.300 
one round each cordoning 40 now you
query<00:03:53.910> on<00:03:54.060> 40k<00:03:54.630> but<00:03:55.440> the<00:03:55.680> thing<00:03:55.709> is<00:03:55.920> you

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:56.310 
query on 40k but the thing is you

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:58.100 
query on 40k but the thing is you
probably<00:03:56.700> won't<00:03:56.910> be<00:03:57.000> able<00:03:57.120> to<00:03:57.209> do<00:03:57.330> 40<00:03:57.900> an<00:03:57.989> hour

00:03:58.100 --> 00:03:58.110 
probably won't be able to do 40 an hour

00:03:58.110 --> 00:03:59.810 
probably won't be able to do 40 an hour
because<00:03:58.380> you<00:03:58.530> can't<00:03:58.739> actually<00:03:59.010> find<00:03:59.400> that

00:03:59.810 --> 00:03:59.820 
because you can't actually find that

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:01.880 
because you can't actually find that
many<00:04:00.510> in<00:04:00.690> an<00:04:00.810> hour<00:04:00.959> so<00:04:01.290> i'll<00:04:01.350> say<00:04:01.560> you<00:04:01.620> can<00:04:01.799> do

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:01.890 
many in an hour so i'll say you can do

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:03.920 
many in an hour so i'll say you can do
about<00:04:02.010> 20<00:04:02.580> an<00:04:02.700> hour<00:04:02.820> which<00:04:03.090> is<00:04:03.180> about<00:04:03.239> 20k<00:04:03.870> an

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:03.930 
about 20 an hour which is about 20k an

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:07.940 
about 20 an hour which is about 20k an
hour<00:04:04.130> which<00:04:05.130> isn't<00:04:05.880> isn't<00:04:06.480> bad<00:04:06.900> I<00:04:07.320> mean<00:04:07.680> look

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:07.950 
hour which isn't isn't bad I mean look

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:11.900 
hour which isn't isn't bad I mean look
as<00:04:08.370> you<00:04:08.519> can<00:04:08.640> see<00:04:08.790> here<00:04:09.560> one<00:04:10.560> of<00:04:10.680> them<00:04:10.799> sold<00:04:11.040> 6.6

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:11.910 
as you can see here one of them sold 6.6

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:14.120 
as you can see here one of them sold 6.6
k<00:04:12.090> that<00:04:12.239> was<00:04:12.420> earlier<00:04:12.810> today<00:04:12.959> but<00:04:13.709> the<00:04:13.860> prices

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:14.130 
k that was earlier today but the prices

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:16.310 
k that was earlier today but the prices
do<00:04:14.519> change<00:04:14.880> so<00:04:15.209> if<00:04:15.510> they<00:04:15.690> change<00:04:15.989> the<00:04:16.140> speed

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:16.320 
do change so if they change the speed

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:19.070 
do change so if they change the speed
just<00:04:16.769> bid<00:04:16.950> one<00:04:17.250> grand<00:04:17.640> under<00:04:18.269> the<00:04:18.630> price<00:04:18.870> that

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:19.080 
just bid one grand under the price that

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:20.270 
just bid one grand under the price that
they<00:04:19.169> are<00:04:19.320> they<00:04:19.560> wouldn't<00:04:19.799> there<00:04:19.979> they

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:20.280 
they are they wouldn't there they

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:22.580 
they are they wouldn't there they
shouldn't<00:04:20.489> change<00:04:20.880> too<00:04:21.180> much<00:04:21.209> if<00:04:22.140> you<00:04:22.380> find

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:22.590 
shouldn't change too much if you find

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:23.990 
shouldn't change too much if you find
you're<00:04:22.740> just<00:04:22.919> getting<00:04:23.130> outbid<00:04:23.250> on<00:04:23.490> all<00:04:23.820> of

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:24.000 
you're just getting outbid on all of

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.720 
you're just getting outbid on all of
them<00:04:24.210> then<00:04:24.510> make<00:04:24.720> sure<00:04:25.250> you

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:26.730 
them then make sure you

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:29.930 
them then make sure you
bid<00:04:26.940> a<00:04:26.970> bit<00:04:27.180> higher<00:04:27.420> because<00:04:28.490> that's<00:04:29.490> probably

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:29.940 
bid a bit higher because that's probably

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:33.110 
bid a bit higher because that's probably
why<00:04:30.180> the<00:04:30.690> price<00:04:30.930> is<00:04:31.460> the<00:04:32.460> price<00:04:32.490> is<00:04:32.730> probably

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:33.120 
why the price is the price is probably

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:34.730 
why the price is the price is probably
changed<00:04:33.540> because<00:04:33.690> you<00:04:34.020> you<00:04:34.350> need<00:04:34.500> to<00:04:34.590> bid<00:04:34.710> a

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:34.740 
changed because you you need to bid a

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:37.130 
changed because you you need to bid a
bit<00:04:34.920> higher<00:04:35.100> see<00:04:36.030> as<00:04:36.210> you<00:04:36.330> can<00:04:36.480> see<00:04:36.630> there<00:04:36.870> got
