00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:31.410
 hello do you remember pluto if 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.660
 they implant that planet that people 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:36.360
 learned at school as being the ultimate 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.500
 of the solar system and has been demoted 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.710
 by scientists 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:44.100
 the category of dwarf planet recalled 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:46.199
 because it is this little planet that is 6 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.750
 billion kilometers away from the 

00:00:46.199 --> 00:00:51.540
 land again gained the attention of 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:54.329
 science after nine years of traveling 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:57.330
 Nasa's new horizons probe is fine 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:59.220
 close to pluton certain way to say already 

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:01.379
 that in no time the probe will arrive 

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:04.229
 less than 12 thousand kilometers from the planet 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:06.270
 not only for you to understand how all this 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:08.460
 started in 2006 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.810
 the probe was launched into space on board the 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.600
 rocket atlas 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:14.310
 she went to Jupiter where she used the 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.040
 the gravity of this planet as a 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:21.060
 slingshot to catch more speed 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:23.250
 That was in 2007 from here to neurosis 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.350
 remained asleep traveling through the 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.750
 space until December of the year 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.580
 last she was awake 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.980
 all this was a preparation for the 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:33.270
 great moment that the approximation of the 

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:35.850
 pluto probe 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.920
 At that moment the probe will take a turn 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.680
 around the planet and get images 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:43.470
 of very high resolution both on duty 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:45.690
 how of his five fights seven 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.250
 instruments installed in the probe will 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:48.600
 capture these very high-quality images 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.210
 resolution 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:54.810
 all this data will be transmitted 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:57.450
 to pluto earth to the land will 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:00.030
 take four and a half hours until all 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:03.780
 the information is uploaded at headquarters 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:05.430
 now because all this is that the 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:08.280
 scientists want to study the composition 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:11.670
 and the pluton surface temperature and 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:13.920
 its largest moon Charon in fact this 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:16.409
 mission may be surprising since the region 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:19.230
 where the pluto is little says engraved 

00:02:16.409 --> 00:02:22.200
 by scientists to end only one 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:24.510
 curiosity on board the probe are the 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:27.360
 ashes of researcher clayton bomb that 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:30.540
 was the discoverer of gate in 1930 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:33.680
 also to other items between them two 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:33.680
