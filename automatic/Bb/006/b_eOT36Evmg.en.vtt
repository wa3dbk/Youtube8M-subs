00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:49.180 
really see on my Sony Vegas screen but

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:51.210 
really see on my Sony Vegas screen but
84<00:00:49.510> pays<00:00:49.690> you<00:00:50.350> might<00:00:50.500> consider<00:00:50.800> a<00:00:50.980> letdown

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:51.220 
84 pays you might consider a letdown

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:53.340 
84 pays you might consider a letdown
also<00:00:51.550> 84<00:00:51.880> dribbling<00:00:52.300> but<00:00:52.510> in<00:00:52.720> my<00:00:52.899> opinion

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:53.350 
also 84 dribbling but in my opinion

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:54.780 
also 84 dribbling but in my opinion
because<00:00:53.470> of<00:00:53.649> his<00:00:53.829> height<00:00:54.130> he's<00:00:54.340> a<00:00:54.370> little<00:00:54.670> bit

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:54.790 
because of his height he's a little bit

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:56.819 
because of his height he's a little bit
taller<00:00:54.970> than<00:00:55.239> the<00:00:55.390> average<00:00:55.660> right<00:00:56.470> wing<00:00:56.649> got

00:00:56.819 --> 00:00:56.829 
taller than the average right wing got

00:00:56.829 --> 00:00:58.170 
taller than the average right wing got
he<00:00:56.890> like<00:00:57.040> five<00:00:57.220> or<00:00:57.399> five<00:00:57.489> five<00:00:57.700> or<00:00:57.850> six<00:00:58.030> I've

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:58.180 
he like five or five five or six I've

00:00:58.180 --> 00:00:59.549 
he like five or five five or six I've
got<00:00:58.329> five<00:00:58.540> for<00:00:58.690> nine<00:00:58.870> I<00:00:58.899> think<00:00:59.200> he<00:00:59.320> was<00:00:59.440> which

00:00:59.549 --> 00:00:59.559 
got five for nine I think he was which

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:01.560 
got five for nine I think he was which
is<00:00:59.590> a<00:00:59.710> bit<00:00:59.860> taller<00:01:00.100> he<00:01:00.520> seems<00:01:00.820> a<00:01:00.910> lot<00:01:01.090> faster

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:01.570 
is a bit taller he seems a lot faster

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:03.120 
is a bit taller he seems a lot faster
and<00:01:01.660> he's<00:01:01.750> a<00:01:01.809> lot<00:01:01.960> stronger<00:01:02.350> than<00:01:02.800> those<00:01:02.920> um

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:03.130 
and he's a lot stronger than those um

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:04.229

the decision to go by him or not in my
opinion

00:04:56.879 --> 00:04:56.889 
opinion

00:04:56.889 --> 00:04:57.930 
opinion
I<00:04:56.919> probably<00:04:57.130> wait<00:04:57.340> for<00:04:57.460> his<00:04:57.550> price<00:04:57.700> to<00:04:57.820> come

00:04:57.930 --> 00:04:57.940 
I probably wait for his price to come

00:04:57.940 --> 00:04:59.159 
I probably wait for his price to come
down<00:04:58.090> a<00:04:58.120> little<00:04:58.330> bit<00:04:58.540> more<00:04:58.720> he<00:04:58.840> looks<00:04:59.050> like

00:04:59.159 --> 00:04:59.169 
down a little bit more he looks like

00:04:59.169 --> 00:05:00.720

he's<00:04:59.320> dropping<00:04:59.620> in<00:04:59.710> price<00:04:59.740> people<00:05:00.490> probably

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:00.730 
he's dropping in price people probably

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:03.030 
he's dropping in price people probably
had<00:05:01.600> enough<00:05:01.840> of<00:05:01.900> using<00:05:02.260> him<00:05:02.380> or<00:05:02.500> whatever<00:05:02.740> bit

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:03.040 
had enough of using him or whatever bit

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:05.400
