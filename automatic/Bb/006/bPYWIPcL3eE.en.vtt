00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:32.290 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:34.229 

loss<00:00:32.980> of<00:00:33.190> vision<00:00:33.399> when<00:00:33.820> he<00:00:33.910> was<00:00:34.030> nine<00:00:34.210> years

00:00:34.229 --> 00:00:34.239 
loss of vision when he was nine years

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:35.940 
loss of vision when he was nine years
old<00:00:34.660> so<00:00:34.840> we<00:00:35.170> decided<00:00:35.470> to<00:00:35.559> getting<00:00:35.770> something

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:35.950 
old so we decided to getting something

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:37.650 
old so we decided to getting something
as<00:00:36.190> a<00:00:36.220> family<00:00:36.670> and<00:00:36.730> got<00:00:36.910> the<00:00:37.059> ski<00:00:37.300> racing

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:37.660 
as a family and got the ski racing

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:39.150 
as a family and got the ski racing
because<00:00:37.870> we<00:00:38.020> used<00:00:38.140> to<00:00:38.200> ski<00:00:38.739> every<00:00:38.860> week<00:00:39.129> just

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:39.160 
because we used to ski every week just

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:41.310 
because we used to ski every week just
for<00:00:39.550> fun<00:00:39.760> and<00:00:39.970> then<00:00:40.300> his<00:00:40.420> vision<00:00:40.720> got<00:00:40.870> worse<00:00:41.079> so

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:41.320 
for fun and then his vision got worse so

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:42.750 
for fun and then his vision got worse so
we<00:00:41.440> decided<00:00:41.710> hey<00:00:41.920> why<00:00:42.190> don't<00:00:42.250> we<00:00:42.430> look<00:00:42.699> into

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:42.760 
we decided hey why don't we look into

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:44.760 
we decided hey why don't we look into
some<00:00:43.000> para<00:00:43.329> sports<00:00:43.629> and<00:00:43.870> maybe<00:00:43.989> give<00:00:44.320> it<00:00:44.350> a<00:00:44.500> try

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:44.770 
some para sports and maybe give it a try

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:47.400 
some para sports and maybe give it a try
so<00:00:45.400> we<00:00:45.670> found<00:00:45.910> para<00:00:46.449> downhill<00:00:46.900> skiing<00:00:47.170> and

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:47.410

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:51.800 
we're like wow this could be something

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.100

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:55.790 
ourselves and trying to figure out how

ourselves and trying to figure out how
radios<00:00:56.360> work<00:00:56.660> and<00:00:56.990> how<00:00:57.260> we<00:00:58.010> get<00:00:58.160> our<00:00:58.250> timing

00:00:58.480 --> 00:00:58.490 
radios work and how we get our timing

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:00.190 
radios work and how we get our timing
down<00:00:58.790> and<00:00:59.090> then<00:00:59.360> we<00:00:59.570> came<00:00:59.660> out<00:00:59.780> to<00:00:59.960> a<00:00:59.990> Canadian
