 the vinaigrette 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:27.980
 we take the balsamic vinegar syrup 

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:27.980
 maple and walnut oil one can be 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:32.430

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:34.760

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:52.060
 difficult to put in 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:53.380

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:20.210
 great for pregnant women who 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:21.200

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:24.490
