00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
and follow or you try to use draw with a

going to run the balls in rotational
order<00:00:36.829> in<00:00:38.090> this<00:00:39.090> first<00:00:39.390> example<00:00:39.570> here<00:00:40.290> I<00:00:41.090> am

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:42.680 
order in this first example here I am

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:46.400 
order in this first example here I am
going<00:00:43.680> to<00:00:43.800> run<00:00:43.950> the<00:00:44.040> balls<00:00:44.280> using<00:00:45.030> follow<00:00:45.629> with

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
going to run the balls using follow with

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.819 
going to run the balls using follow with
inside<00:00:46.890> English<00:00:47.280> and<00:00:48.140> each<00:00:49.140> time<00:00:49.440> I'm<00:00:49.649> trying

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
inside English and each time I'm trying

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.279 
inside English and each time I'm trying
to<00:00:50.070> bring<00:00:50.280> the<00:00:50.430> cue<00:00:51.120> ball<00:00:51.300> back<00:00:51.570> to<00:00:51.840> the<00:00:51.870> center

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
to bring the cue ball back to the center

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:59.689 
to bring the cue ball back to the center
of<00:00:52.379> the<00:00:52.469> table<00:00:57.980> now<00:00:58.980> this<00:00:59.190> is<00:00:59.340> going<00:00:59.460> to<00:00:59.520> help

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
of the table now this is going to help

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.770 
of the table now this is going to help
you<00:00:59.879> develop<00:01:00.149> your<00:01:00.859> speed<00:01:01.859> control<00:01:02.600> and<00:01:03.600> it's

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
you develop your speed control and it's

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.000 
you develop your speed control and it's
going<00:01:03.870> to<00:01:03.930> challenge<00:01:04.199> your<00:01:04.500> shot<00:01:04.710> making

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
going to challenge your shot making

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.969 
going to challenge your shot making
because<00:01:05.519> when<00:01:06.060> you<00:01:06.240> use<00:01:06.570> a<00:01:06.900> lot<00:01:07.380> of<00:01:07.409> English<00:01:07.680> on

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
because when you use a lot of English on

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.640 
because when you use a lot of English on
a<00:01:08.010> shot<00:01:08.750> it's<00:01:09.750> going<00:01:09.869> to<00:01:10.020> make<00:01:10.200> the<00:01:10.290> cue<00:01:10.470> ball

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
a shot it's going to make the cue ball

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:11.990 
a shot it's going to make the cue ball
do<00:01:10.799> a<00:01:10.830> little<00:01:11.159> something<00:01:11.460> different<00:01:11.580> than<00:01:11.909> it

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
do a little something different than it

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.640 
do a little something different than it
wouldn't<00:01:12.210> otherwise<00:01:12.299> do<00:01:12.840> it's<00:01:13.409> going<00:01:13.590> to

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
wouldn't otherwise do it's going to

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.670 
wouldn't otherwise do it's going to
curve<00:01:14.369> a<00:01:14.549> little<00:01:14.700> bit<00:01:15.320> so<00:01:16.320> you<00:01:16.380> have<00:01:16.560> to

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
curve a little bit so you have to

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.230 
curve a little bit so you have to
compensate<00:01:17.040> for<00:01:17.310> that<00:01:17.460> on<00:01:17.820> each<00:01:17.970> shot

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
compensate for that on each shot

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.420 
compensate for that on each shot
depending<00:01:18.840> on<00:01:19.200> how<00:01:19.320> much<00:01:19.439> English<00:01:19.740> you<00:01:20.009> use<00:01:20.250> I

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:22.430 
depending on how much English you use I

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:26.179 
depending on how much English you use I
would<00:01:23.430> rank<00:01:23.640> this<00:01:24.590> for<00:01:25.590> a<00:01:25.619> beginner<00:01:25.979> to<00:01:26.159> a

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
would rank this for a beginner to a

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.280 
would rank this for a beginner to a
novice<00:01:26.670> player<00:01:27.060> as<00:01:27.390> being<00:01:27.689> a<00:01:27.810> very<00:01:27.990> difficult

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
novice player as being a very difficult

novice player as being a very difficult
drill<00:01:28.710> to<00:01:28.860> do<00:01:29.009> it<00:01:29.189> took<00:01:29.340> me<00:01:30.890> more<00:01:31.890> than<00:01:32.009> a<00:01:32.070> few

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
drill to do it took me more than a few

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:38.260 
drill to do it took me more than a few
tries<00:01:32.520> to<00:01:32.549> get<00:01:32.880> this<00:01:33.060> done

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:38.270 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:41.649 

and<00:01:38.869> as<00:01:39.049> you<00:01:39.229> go<00:01:39.350> down<00:01:39.590> or<00:01:39.950> as<00:01:40.579> you<00:01:40.790> progress<00:01:41.240> in

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:41.659 
and as you go down or as you progress in

and as you go down or as you progress in
the<00:01:41.750> drill<00:01:42.020> the<00:01:42.170> shots<00:01:42.619> become<00:01:43.070> progressively

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:43.970 
the drill the shots become progressively

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:53.380 
the drill the shots become progressively
harder<00:01:44.240> to<00:01:44.479> do<00:01:50.920> and<00:01:51.920> if<00:01:52.340> you<00:01:52.580> noticed<00:01:52.970> each

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:53.390 
harder to do and if you noticed each

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:56.620 
harder to do and if you noticed each
