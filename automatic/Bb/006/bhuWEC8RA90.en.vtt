00:00:21.469 --> 00:00:24.239
 some details in gray 

00:00:24.239 --> 00:00:26.409
 in a screen of Cuba 

00:00:26.409 --> 00:00:29.589
 founded the city while our country 

00:00:29.589 --> 00:00:32.150
 it's a pretty interesting screen 30 euros 

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:33.960
 I could observe 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.790
 it's the click cat 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.060
 it's something big 

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:40.060
 Jose martin 

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:44.310
 which induces indicates that it is not 100% 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.820
 30 mobility 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:49.870
 the people can not 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:54.410
 from one place to another but it is more than complicated leonel desks and 

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:57.620
 some activities during night hours 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:00.730
 more professional brigades 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:03.630
 let's try to observe 

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:06.990
 you have a dream your life from the pld the creator of glee 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:09.189
 i some 

00:01:09.189 --> 00:01:13.560
 some that are lic luis m wrote worker that is the connectivity of the modem 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:18.140
 they do not work for 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:20.270
 they will lecture to attend cards 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:21.950
 memory cards 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:24.760
 i on that occasion with famous being able to observe 

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:27.760
 is the current crisis can 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:30.670
 how is this going 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:33.320
 it is presented p 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:35.680
 so it's take the windows view 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:38.680
 the press the factory ode 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.800
 this is a point of view 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:44.080
 the young premium 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:47.200
 this is the popular an intel core 2 duo processor 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:51.370
 already integrated in 2002 and wash memory 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:54.900
 and a 160 GB hard drive 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:56.790
 day 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:00.720
 which really enough to be able to correct the application of 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:02.940
 windows view here 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:06.690
 What to ask is what is called insecurity a good capacity to 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:08.249
 HDD 

00:02:08.249 --> 00:02:12.259
 for because cubic view and other applications run perfectly fine 

00:02:14.039 --> 00:02:15.490
 as you can see how 

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:17.419
 this the screen that we 

00:02:17.419 --> 00:02:20.789
 in tick tick is integrated by being in this laptop that higuain 

00:02:20.789 --> 00:02:22.539
 It is really difficult 

00:02:22.539 --> 00:02:25.539
 very good the judge said tinelli 

00:02:26.429 --> 00:02:29.429
 It has very good size for those people who are living 

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:31.019
 full 

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:34.409
 we look for some tap that offers you enough 

00:02:35.029 --> 00:02:38.029
 vision of what you compare to carry out your work 

00:02:38.699 --> 00:02:39.609
 keyboard 

00:02:39.609 --> 00:02:41.239
 really is 

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:44.849
 is the same as the one we can find many other laptops 

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:47.019
 but the interesting thing about this is that 

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:51.939
 the papain part the shell of the dawn p the first the inner part of the laptop 

00:02:51.939 --> 00:02:53.299
 that is inclusive 

00:02:53.299 --> 00:02:56.369
 acqua allows us to have greater security 

00:02:56.369 --> 00:02:57.689
 do not get damaged 

00:02:57.689 --> 00:02:59.209
 usually 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:03.389
 he escapes them because we can put his hands with the kings he escapes 

00:03:03.389 --> 00:03:05.879
 just be fooled 

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:07.649
 jonathan lacerda health 

00:03:07.649 --> 00:03:10.649
 we have the greatest naturalness 

00:03:11.249 --> 00:03:12.749
 what added 

00:03:12.749 --> 00:03:16.009
 the most basically does not have any problem 

00:03:16.009 --> 00:03:19.859
 i have good sensitivity we can run perfectly well 

00:03:19.859 --> 00:03:23.089
 all the applications that we want 

00:03:23.089 --> 00:03:26.279
 in the part of bildu has its complication 

00:03:26.279 --> 00:03:29.279
 we repudiate this additional analysis 

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:32.669
 the problems for 

00:03:32.669 --> 00:03:35.669
 on the tatami 90% 

00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:39.489
 You really have to have a little patience for yourself 

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:42.719
 crystal back to the future argentina sÃ¡bato that took the capital 

00:03:45.379 --> 00:03:47.329
 from there on offside 

00:03:47.329 --> 00:03:49.739
 there are many other applications 

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:52.739
 to be able to meet see the capacity 

00:03:53.919 --> 00:03:56.029
 we had no problem 

00:03:56.029 --> 00:03:59.029
 running 

00:04:00.219 --> 00:04:03.219
 music we could do something 

00:04:05.479 --> 00:04:08.109
 the one that stopped the country 

00:04:08.109 --> 00:04:10.799
 it happens that you have to give up 

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:12.069
 machine 

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:15.629
 There is a very interesting offer park that is a professional 

00:04:15.629 --> 00:04:16.699
 and what we have left 

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:20.420
 hilton hunger a computer that offers performance 

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:23.249
 after the very scandal by handling 

00:04:23.249 --> 00:04:27.650
 prevents you from having your applications have an approximate cost in the market and 7500 

00:04:27.649 --> 00:04:29.809
 tisci 1800 pesos 

00:04:29.809 --> 00:04:31.569
 these have to recommend 

00:04:31.569 --> 00:04:33.399
 in many thanks and Castro
