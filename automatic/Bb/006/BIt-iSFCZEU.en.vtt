is from our excursion range and what we

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:19.760 
is from our excursion range and what we
do<00:00:18.420> show<00:00:18.570> you<00:00:18.630> here<00:00:18.840> though<00:00:18.990> can<00:00:19.350> be<00:00:19.500> applied

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
do show you here though can be applied

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:21.650 
do show you here though can be applied
to<00:00:19.800> other<00:00:20.100> tents<00:00:20.550> of<00:00:20.640> a<00:00:20.730> similar<00:00:21.119> style<00:00:21.330> from

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
to other tents of a similar style from

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.540 
to other tents of a similar style from
this<00:00:21.840> range<00:00:22.109> so<00:00:22.800> what<00:00:22.920> we'll<00:00:23.010> do<00:00:23.130> is<00:00:23.279> just<00:00:23.310> take

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
this range so what we'll do is just take

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:24.740 
this range so what we'll do is just take
it<00:00:23.670> out<00:00:23.730> of<00:00:23.760> the<00:00:23.850> bag<00:00:24.000> and<00:00:24.300> show<00:00:24.510> you<00:00:24.570> how<00:00:24.720> to

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
it out of the bag and show you how to

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:33.490 
it out of the bag and show you how to
get<00:00:24.960> started

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:33.500 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.130 

so<00:00:34.400> when<00:00:34.550> you<00:00:34.670> have<00:00:34.820> your<00:00:35.240> fly<00:00:35.570> sheet<00:00:35.810> lead<00:00:35.960> out

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:36.140 
so when you have your fly sheet lead out

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:37.600 
so when you have your fly sheet lead out
into<00:00:36.380> position<00:00:36.770> what<00:00:37.010> we're<00:00:37.100> going<00:00:37.220> to<00:00:37.250> do<00:00:37.400> is

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:37.610 
into position what we're going to do is

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:39.880 
into position what we're going to do is
just<00:00:37.940> take<00:00:38.930> the<00:00:39.020> polls<00:00:39.200> here<00:00:39.410> and<00:00:39.620> assemble

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:39.890 
just take the polls here and assemble

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:41.830 
just take the polls here and assemble
them<00:00:40.100> this<00:00:40.640> is<00:00:40.760> really<00:00:41.000> easy<00:00:41.210> because<00:00:41.450> all<00:00:41.540> the

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:41.840 
them this is really easy because all the

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:44.020 
them this is really easy because all the
polls<00:00:42.080> on<00:00:42.380> these<00:00:42.680> tents<00:00:43.040> are<00:00:43.250> shot<00:00:43.520> coded<00:00:43.880> from

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:44.030 
polls on these tents are shot coded from

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:45.820 
polls on these tents are shot coded from
one<00:00:44.210> side<00:00:44.450> all<00:00:44.720> the<00:00:44.990> way<00:00:45.080> through<00:00:45.320> to<00:00:45.650> the

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:45.830 
one side all the way through to the

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:48.070 
one side all the way through to the
other<00:00:45.920> so<00:00:46.550> as<00:00:46.640> I<00:00:46.730> say<00:00:46.910> nice<00:00:47.420> and<00:00:47.600> simple<00:00:47.840> to<00:00:47.930> put

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:48.080 
other so as I say nice and simple to put

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:50.110 
other so as I say nice and simple to put
together<00:00:48.170> so<00:00:48.950> we'll<00:00:49.040> just<00:00:49.160> do<00:00:49.280> that<00:00:49.310> and<00:00:49.640> show

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:50.120 
together so we'll just do that and show

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:52.330 
together so we'll just do that and show
you<00:00:50.180> what<00:00:50.390> to<00:00:50.510> do<00:00:50.630> next<00:00:50.660> so<00:00:51.140> I<00:00:51.920> know<00:00:52.130> that<00:00:52.160> the

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:52.340 
you what to do next so I know that the

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:54.040 
you what to do next so I know that the
poles<00:00:52.550> are<00:00:52.850> assembled<00:00:53.330> we're<00:00:53.720> just<00:00:53.900> going<00:00:54.020> to

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:54.050 
poles are assembled we're just going to

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:55.900 
poles are assembled we're just going to
pop<00:00:54.320> them<00:00:54.440> through<00:00:54.590> the<00:00:54.680> pole<00:00:54.860> Steve's<00:00:55.100> a<00:00:55.340> good

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:55.910 
pop them through the pole Steve's a good

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:57.640 
pop them through the pole Steve's a good
point<00:00:56.090> here<00:00:56.210> is<00:00:56.540> all<00:00:56.960> these<00:00:57.170> poles<00:00:57.410> are

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:57.650 
point here is all these poles are

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:59.440 
point here is all these poles are
color-coded<00:00:58.310> so<00:00:58.610> that's<00:00:58.910> going<00:00:59.120> to<00:00:59.180> make<00:00:59.300> sure

00:00:59.440 --> 00:00:59.450 
color-coded so that's going to make sure

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:00.700 
color-coded so that's going to make sure
that<00:00:59.600> you<00:00:59.720> get<00:00:59.810> the<00:00:59.930> right<00:01:00.050> pole<00:01:00.350> in<00:01:00.560> the<00:01:00.680> right

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:00.710 
that you get the right pole in the right

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:03.370 
that you get the right pole in the right
place<00:01:01.010> once<00:01:01.820> they<00:01:02.090> are<00:01:02.630> in<00:01:02.780> this<00:01:02.900> leaves<00:01:03.110> will

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:03.380 
place once they are in this leaves will

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:04.840 
place once they are in this leaves will
then<00:01:03.500> show<00:01:03.680> you<00:01:03.739> how<00:01:04.040> easy<00:01:04.220> it<00:01:04.339> is<00:01:04.430> to<00:01:04.640> touch

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:04.850 
then show you how easy it is to touch

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:30.530 
then show you how easy it is to touch
them<00:01:05.059> using<00:01:05.449> the<00:01:05.570> ring<00:01:05.690> and<00:01:05.840> pin<00:01:05.960> system

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.790 

so<00:01:31.540> once<00:01:31.720> all<00:01:31.930> of<00:01:32.080> the<00:01:32.140> pores<00:01:32.380> are<00:01:32.530> in<00:01:32.590> place

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:32.800 
so once all of the pores are in place

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:33.780 
so once all of the pores are in place
we're<00:01:33.040> just<00:01:33.070> going<00:01:33.280> to<00:01:33.340> go<00:01:33.430> to<00:01:33.460> the<00:01:33.640> back

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:33.790 
we're just going to go to the back

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:47.320 
we're just going to go to the back
corners<00:01:34.240> and<00:01:34.450> PEG<00:01:34.750> the<00:01:34.870> flysheet<00:01:35.080> down<00:01:35.500> there

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:47.330 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:49.340 

once<00:01:48.330> that's<00:01:48.479> done<00:01:48.690> what<00:01:48.960> we're<00:01:49.049> going<00:01:49.200> to<00:01:49.229> do

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
once that's done what we're going to do

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:50.990 
once that's done what we're going to do
is<00:01:49.560> just<00:01:49.740> attach<00:01:50.040> the<00:01:50.280> poles<00:01:50.520> to<00:01:50.610> the<00:01:50.790> flysheet

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
is just attach the poles to the flysheet

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.780 
is just attach the poles to the flysheet
using<00:01:51.960> a<00:01:52.080> ring<00:01:52.320> and<00:01:52.440> pin<00:01:52.590> system<00:01:52.950> what<00:01:53.760> you

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
using a ring and pin system what you

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.310 
using a ring and pin system what you
will<00:01:53.970> find<00:01:54.210> here<00:01:54.390> is<00:01:54.479> it<00:01:54.570> on<00:01:54.690> one<00:01:54.869> side<00:01:55.110> of<00:01:55.140> the

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
will find here is it on one side of the

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.320 
will find here is it on one side of the
tent<00:01:55.530> you<00:01:55.619> have<00:01:55.800> a<00:01:55.830> fixed<00:01:56.250> attachment<00:01:56.760> and<00:01:57.150> on

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:57.330 
tent you have a fixed attachment and on

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:59.030 
tent you have a fixed attachment and on
the<00:01:57.450> other<00:01:57.540> side<00:01:57.659> it's<00:01:58.050> adjustable<00:01:58.500> so<00:01:58.950> it's

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
the other side it's adjustable so it's

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.010 
the other side it's adjustable so it's
always<00:01:59.250> a<00:01:59.280> good<00:01:59.460> tip<00:01:59.670> here<00:01:59.820> to<00:02:00.030> start<00:02:00.299> and<00:02:00.720> with

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
always a good tip here to start and with

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.260 
always a good tip here to start and with
the<00:02:01.140> pole<00:02:01.320> going<00:02:01.920> into<00:02:02.100> the<00:02:02.190> fixed<00:02:02.580> side<00:02:02.759> and

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
the pole going into the fixed side and

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:04.760 
the pole going into the fixed side and
that<00:02:03.420> way<00:02:03.540> you<00:02:03.600> should<00:02:03.780> find<00:02:04.140> it<00:02:04.320> a<00:02:04.409> little<00:02:04.560> bit

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
that way you should find it a little bit

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:12.790 
that way you should find it a little bit
easier<00:02:05.070> once<00:02:05.520> you<00:02:05.610> get<00:02:05.790> to<00:02:05.909> the<00:02:06.000> other<00:02:06.119> end

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:12.800 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:18.819 

you

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:18.829 

00:02:18.829 --> 00:02:21.589 

once<00:02:19.829> the<00:02:19.980> paws<00:02:20.159> are<00:02:20.459> attached<00:02:20.909> at<00:02:21.209> the<00:02:21.450> end

00:02:21.589 --> 00:02:21.599 
once the paws are attached at the end

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:23.179 
once the paws are attached at the end
we're<00:02:22.200> simply<00:02:22.500> going<00:02:22.620> to<00:02:22.680> clip<00:02:22.860> the<00:02:22.980> flysheet

00:02:23.179 --> 00:02:23.189 
we're simply going to clip the flysheet

00:02:23.189 --> 00:02:26.330 
we're simply going to clip the flysheet
onto<00:02:23.790> the<00:02:23.909> poles<00:02:24.360> and<00:02:24.629> then<00:02:25.349> we're<00:02:26.189> going<00:02:26.280> to

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
onto the poles and then we're going to

00:02:26.340 --> 00:03:04.250 
onto the poles and then we're going to
repeat<00:02:26.640> the<00:02:26.730> process<00:02:27.049> going<00:02:28.049> forward

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.539 

once<00:03:05.260> all<00:03:05.409> of<00:03:05.439> the<00:03:05.590> poles<00:03:05.799> are<00:03:06.010> attached<00:03:06.310> we're

00:03:06.539 --> 00:03:06.549 
once all of the poles are attached we're

00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:08.039 
once all of the poles are attached we're
simply<00:03:06.760> going<00:03:06.879> to<00:03:06.939> walk<00:03:07.150> the<00:03:07.359> tent<00:03:07.569> forward

00:03:08.039 --> 00:03:08.049 
simply going to walk the tent forward

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:09.420 
simply going to walk the tent forward
and<00:03:08.260> then<00:03:08.680> we're<00:03:08.769> going<00:03:08.859> to<00:03:08.920> peg<00:03:09.129> out<00:03:09.280> the

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:09.430 
and then we're going to peg out the

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:19.600 
and then we're going to peg out the
front<00:03:09.639> two<00:03:09.790> corners

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:19.610 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:21.580 

so<00:03:20.420> now<00:03:20.660> what<00:03:20.810> we're<00:03:20.930> going<00:03:21.020> to<00:03:21.080> do<00:03:21.230> is<00:03:21.410> just

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:21.590 
so now what we're going to do is just

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:23.380 
so now what we're going to do is just
zip<00:03:21.800> open<00:03:22.100> the<00:03:22.190> door<00:03:22.340> and<00:03:22.580> roll<00:03:22.790> that<00:03:23.000> up<00:03:23.120> out

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:23.390 
zip open the door and roll that up out

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:25.390 
zip open the door and roll that up out
the<00:03:23.540> way<00:03:23.660> and<00:03:24.410> that<00:03:24.440> will<00:03:24.620> enable<00:03:24.830> us<00:03:25.070> to<00:03:25.100> take

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:25.400 
the way and that will enable us to take

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:26.740 
the way and that will enable us to take
the<00:03:25.520> ground<00:03:25.640> sheet<00:03:25.910> inside<00:03:26.210> the<00:03:26.360> tent<00:03:26.570> and

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:26.750 
the ground sheet inside the tent and

00:03:26.750 --> 00:04:00.050 
the ground sheet inside the tent and
toggle<00:03:27.200> that<00:03:27.260> into<00:03:27.530> position

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:00.060 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:02.880 

so<00:04:01.060> the<00:04:01.300> next<00:04:01.450> step<00:04:01.660> is<00:04:01.810> just<00:04:02.020> taking<00:04:02.320> the<00:04:02.560> soup

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:02.890 
so the next step is just taking the soup

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:04.560 
so the next step is just taking the soup
and<00:04:03.040> compartment<00:04:03.490> and<00:04:03.610> attaching<00:04:04.240> them<00:04:04.330> into

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:04.570 
and compartment and attaching them into

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:52.200 
and compartment and attaching them into
place

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:52.210 

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:54.520 

so<00:04:53.210> no<00:04:53.419> what<00:04:53.570> we're<00:04:53.690> going<00:04:53.810> to<00:04:53.840> do<00:04:53.990> is<00:04:54.169> just<00:04:54.350> sit

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:54.530 
so no what we're going to do is just sit

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:56.469 
so no what we're going to do is just sit
down<00:04:54.560> the<00:04:54.979> the<00:04:55.400> front<00:04:55.580> door<00:04:55.759> here<00:04:55.970> and<00:04:56.330> we're

00:04:56.469 --> 00:04:56.479 
down the the front door here and we're

00:04:56.479 --> 00:04:58.390 
down the the front door here and we're
going<00:04:56.570> to<00:04:56.630> peg<00:04:56.810> out<00:04:56.930> all<00:04:57.139> of<00:04:57.169> the<00:04:57.590> side<00:04:58.009> pagan

00:04:58.390 --> 00:04:58.400 
going to peg out all of the side pagan

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:12.990 
going to peg out all of the side pagan
points<00:04:58.669> around<00:04:59.000> the<00:04:59.090> edge<00:04:59.180> of<00:04:59.300> the<00:04:59.419> tent

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:13.000 

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.279 

now<00:05:14.000> that<00:05:14.180> the<00:05:14.270> tent<00:05:14.479> has<00:05:14.659> been<00:05:14.689> pegged<00:05:15.050> we'll

00:05:15.279 --> 00:05:15.289 
now that the tent has been pegged we'll

00:05:15.289 --> 00:05:16.899 
now that the tent has been pegged we'll
just<00:05:15.469> grab<00:05:15.560> hold<00:05:15.800> of<00:05:16.039> the<00:05:16.189> pegging<00:05:16.490> points<00:05:16.789> of

00:05:16.899 --> 00:05:16.909 
just grab hold of the pegging points of

00:05:16.909 --> 00:05:18.399 
just grab hold of the pegging points of
the<00:05:17.150> ground<00:05:17.360> sheet<00:05:17.569> and<00:05:17.750> we'll<00:05:17.960> fill<00:05:18.139> them<00:05:18.259> out

00:05:18.399 --> 00:05:18.409 
the ground sheet and we'll fill them out

00:05:18.409 --> 00:05:29.350 
the ground sheet and we'll fill them out
and<00:05:19.310> PEG<00:05:19.610> them<00:05:19.789> into<00:05:20.090> place

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:29.360 

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:32.060 

so<00:05:30.360> the<00:05:30.510> final<00:05:30.840> piece<00:05:30.990> of<00:05:31.230> setup<00:05:31.680> that<00:05:31.710> we<00:05:31.920> need

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:32.070

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:33.860 
so the final piece of setup that we need
to<00:05:32.130> do<00:05:32.280> on<00:05:32.520> these<00:05:32.700> tents<00:05:33.060> is<00:05:33.180> just<00:05:33.390> to<00:05:33.510> unroll
