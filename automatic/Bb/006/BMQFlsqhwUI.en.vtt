00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
there now we're going to layer it

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.240

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:39.580 
might be quite nice this could be your

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:42.680 
might be quite nice this could be your
bit<00:01:39.700> you<00:01:39.729> can<00:01:39.940> do<00:01:40.030> the<00:01:40.150> layer<00:01:40.330> of<00:01:40.630> pears<00:01:41.440> Murray

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:42.690 
bit you can do the layer of pears Murray

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:47.219 
bit you can do the layer of pears Murray
it's<00:01:43.690> a<00:01:43.780> sprinkling<00:01:45.420> so<00:01:46.420> this<00:01:46.509> is<00:01:46.630> about<00:01:46.780> kilo

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:47.229 
it's a sprinkling so this is about kilo

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:50.219 
it's a sprinkling so this is about kilo
of<00:01:47.290> potatoes<00:01:47.470> and<00:01:48.160> two<00:01:48.369> small<00:01:49.060> onions<00:01:49.540> and

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:51.520 
actually what I would do with this dish

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:52.980 
actually what I would do with this dish
is<00:01:51.759> it<00:01:51.880> takes<00:01:52.060> about<00:01:52.180> 15<00:01:52.540> minutes<00:01:52.780> in<00:01:52.869> the<00:01:52.960> oven

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:52.990 
is it takes about 15 minutes in the oven

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:55.200 
is it takes about 15 minutes in the oven
so<00:01:53.979> say<00:01:54.310> your<00:01:54.460> guests<00:01:54.700> are<00:01:54.790> coming<00:01:54.940> I<00:01:55.090> don't
