00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:27.929
 but other 

00:00:27.929 --> 00:00:30.259
 important 

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:31.460

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.830
 the edil launch 

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:55.630

 the same a small knife 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:22.930
 This process is mild. 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:25.950
 drawn 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.240
 what was designed but in all 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:31.020

 does not matter 

00:03:05.039 --> 00:03:08.039
 click 

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:12.180

00:03:22.749 --> 00:03:25.749

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:29.469

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:24.650
 - for sport 

00:04:25.389 --> 00:04:28.300
 It has to be 

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:31.680
 etc 

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:34.669
 pending disputes 

00:04:34.669 --> 00:04:35.680
