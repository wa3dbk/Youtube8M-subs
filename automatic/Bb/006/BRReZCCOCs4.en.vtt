a<00:03:35.150> little<00:03:35.750> bit<00:03:35.959> there<00:03:36.470> you<00:03:36.620> go<00:03:39.220> so<00:03:40.220> the<00:03:40.810> arms

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:41.810 
a little bit there you go so the arms

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:43.629 
a little bit there you go so the arms
were<00:03:42.019> attached<00:03:42.440> by<00:03:42.620> the<00:03:42.680> same<00:03:42.980> gimmick<00:03:43.430> here

00:03:43.629 --> 00:03:43.639 
were attached by the same gimmick here

00:03:43.639 --> 00:03:45.699 
were attached by the same gimmick here
and<00:03:43.760> it's<00:03:43.880> back<00:03:44.150> so<00:03:44.750> all<00:03:44.959> you<00:03:45.200> really<00:03:45.470> have<00:03:45.590> to

00:03:57.079 --> 00:04:01.390 
into the hole here and just rotate the
waist<00:03:57.260> sectioned<00:03:57.950> inward<00:03:58.849> or<00:04:00.040> take<00:04:01.040> the<00:04:01.190> legs

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:01.400 
waist sectioned inward or take the legs

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:08.630 
waist sectioned inward or take the legs
around<00:04:02.410> right<00:04:03.410> open<00:04:03.680> a<00:04:03.829> high<00:04:04.430> heels

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:12.649 

and<00:04:09.640> there's<00:04:10.030> nitro<00:04:10.930> convoy<00:04:11.470> in<00:04:11.769> robot<00:04:12.340> mode

00:04:12.649 --> 00:04:12.659 
and there's nitro convoy in robot mode

00:04:12.659 --> 00:04:16.020 
and there's nitro convoy in robot mode
he<00:04:13.659> can<00:04:14.170> take<00:04:14.500> his<00:04:14.739> weapon<00:04:15.340> and<00:04:15.549> put<00:04:15.790> in<00:04:15.909> his

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:35.610 
peg the hole into the top like that so
you<00:04:32.470> can<00:04:32.680> store<00:04:33.070> it<00:04:33.130> in<00:04:33.550> robot<00:04:34.479> mode<00:04:34.510> if<00:04:35.470> you

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:35.620 
you can store it in robot mode if you

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:37.170 
you can store it in robot mode if you
don't<00:04:35.830> want<00:04:35.979> to<00:04:36.130> have<00:04:36.280> them<00:04:36.430> constantly

you're a die-hard fan of galaxy ports
like<00:06:16.390> I<00:06:16.570> was<00:06:16.870> it's<00:06:17.590> a<00:06:17.800> probably<00:06:18.729> one<00:06:18.940> it's<00:06:19.210> okay

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:19.690 
like I was it's a probably one it's okay

00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:21.450 
like I was it's a probably one it's okay
it's<00:06:20.110> definitely<00:06:20.289> the<00:06:20.650> worst<00:06:20.860> figure

00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:21.460 
it's definitely the worst figure

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:26.850 
it's definitely the worst figure
out<00:06:21.520> of<00:06:21.699> the<00:06:21.819> convoy<00:06:22.389> slash<00:06:24.630> leaders<00:06:25.860> planet

out of the convoy slash leaders planet
leader<00:06:27.069> figures<00:06:28.050> and<00:06:29.050> they<00:06:29.590> definitely<00:06:29.860> could

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:30.160 
leader figures and they definitely could

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:31.680 
leader figures and they definitely could
have<00:06:30.220> done<00:06:30.490> a<00:06:30.520> lot<00:06:30.729> better<00:06:30.789> with<00:06:31.240> this<00:06:31.360> figure

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:31.690 
have done a lot better with this figure

00:06:31.690 --> 00:06:32.909 
have done a lot better with this figure
if<00:06:31.870> they<00:06:32.050> would<00:06:32.259> have<00:06:32.349> got<00:06:32.560> rid<00:06:32.770> of<00:06:32.800> that

00:06:32.909 --> 00:06:32.919 
if they would have got rid of that

00:06:32.919 --> 00:06:35.909 
if they would have got rid of that
stupid<00:06:33.280> jump<00:06:34.060> starter<00:06:34.590> gimmick<00:06:35.590> for

00:06:35.909 --> 00:06:35.919 
stupid jump starter gimmick for

00:06:35.919 --> 00:06:39.330 
stupid jump starter gimmick for
president<00:06:36.580> but<00:06:36.699> Nina<00:06:37.710> transforms<00:06:38.710> itself

president but Nina transforms itself
they<00:06:40.300> could<00:06:40.539> definitely<00:06:40.840> got<00:06:41.139> more<00:06:41.380> of<00:06:41.500> a

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:41.620 
they could definitely got more of a

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:43.469 
they could definitely got more of a
poseable<00:06:42.130> and<00:06:42.310> accurate<00:06:42.789> figure<00:06:43.150> out<00:06:43.240> of<00:06:43.360> this

00:06:43.469 --> 00:06:43.479 
poseable and accurate figure out of this

00:06:43.479 --> 00:06:47.430 
poseable and accurate figure out of this
but<00:06:43.750> it's<00:06:44.020> not<00:06:44.110> bad<00:06:44.590> it<00:06:44.949> says<00:06:45.990> doesn't<00:06:46.990> have

00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:47.440 
but it's not bad it says doesn't have

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:50.490 
but it's not bad it says doesn't have
anything<00:06:47.949> special<00:06:48.340> to<00:06:49.000> it<00:06:49.030> then<00:06:49.419> part<00:06:50.199> of<00:06:50.319> one
