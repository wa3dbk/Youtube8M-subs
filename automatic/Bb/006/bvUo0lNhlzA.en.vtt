00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:06.180
 Tell everyone I like and zac is liquid 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:08.790
 that trickles down in today's video I'm going 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:11.099
 Talk about the worst dubbing games 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:13.500
 done here in brazil that same we 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:16.230
 Let's give the worst pichichi trophy today. 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:19.830
 roger or better the worst roger trophy 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:22.680
 pitt for the worst voiceovers made 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:25.380
 here in brazil then not only scripts 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.550
 as an interpretation made as a 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.699
 if the person was reading a text 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:32.640
 as I am doing now and also a 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:37.440
 total lack of adaptation to the target audience 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:40.500
 finally let's go there our first game of 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.750
 today is assassin's creed 4 black flag that 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.399
 there already saw novel world diet no 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.350
 only for the show I know you already 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:48.329
 saw and I know you certainly already 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.340
 noted that all the work of the 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:52.710
 TV and in adapting the dialogue 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.690
 16th or 17th century Portuguese is 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.289
 basically put the voice in the month and instead 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.989
 from you 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:01:00.629
 leaves he exemplified voice to me if it is a 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:03.300
 piranha instead of you are a piranha 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:06.330
 in the murder of four was a little bit 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:09.210
 besides, but kind of half a step further 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:11.070
 the game speaks every little bit and has the 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.740
 voice actors who seems to be doing more 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:16.049
 the writing contest of the college to see 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.939
 Who speaks more cute than 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:20.340
 interpret anything that really 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:22.950
 happened on the screen deserving the 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.180
 our fifth place in the roger trophy of 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.990
 worst pitt 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:30.869
 the channel is the opposite is really be you 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:35.250
 you have an unusual way of behaving 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:37.890
 quick and easy if I allow the room 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:40.200
 our list is now out without ground 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:42.420
 ascension of kratos the cleiton used 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:45.180
 credits or yes, I do. 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:47.700
 point is another case of dubbing done 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:49.680
 anyway if you have played 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.149
 This game in Portuguese is one of the first 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.130
 The things we notice is that they vote for me. 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:55.320
 the character speaks as closed 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.810
 the man called who does not leave for any 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:59.189
 edson and remembering quite the blatant 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.170
 only it was that pair of stylists 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:02.729
 Cassette and planet americans 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.610
 she is different from the humorous program 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:07.290
 It was not fun to pay a hundred and 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:09.149
 pica real for this game and I saw from the side 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:11.180
 with this quality that is worse than the 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:13.099
 down at the fruit fair 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:16.250
 and it is the best dosage of Brazil of all 

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:20.239
 times and it's free 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:22.250
 yes it's true freedom freedom of 

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:27.500
 flowers that case you without stopping in name 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:31.609
 of the arias and finally the freedom of 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:34.150
 link with the very god of war breaking 

00:02:31.609 --> 00:02:37.000
 isolation as god 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:41.890
 of all the seeds in question is not 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:44.590
 I need to worry about our 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:46.659
 third put our five is a boring is 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:48.849
 3 which is another game in which sony was 

00:02:46.659 --> 00:02:51.069
 pioneer in Brazil in bringing a 

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:53.170
 dubbing matters the game translates well 

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:55.540
 the speeches and everything else is really 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:57.430
 Sad to see how the players gave 10 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:58.359
 fuck for the final quality of work 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:59.950
 their 

00:02:58.359 --> 00:03:01.390
 in the end I have a script 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:03.189
 could have been one of the best 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:05.530
 adaptation work on the history of 

00:03:03.189 --> 00:03:07.989
 games here in brazil but failed by 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:10.000
 Cause of running nuts my friends 

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:13.030
 we are united for the love of god help 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:15.389
 if there is anything between the 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:19.510
 fun is lost even was very much 

00:03:15.389 --> 00:03:20.319
 scholar is funny is a problem was 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:21.849
 barbada 

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:24.790
 sure they did not have according to them 

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:27.030
 no chance then and what doors hid the 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:29.530
 mary poppins barely behind that line 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:31.569
 green 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:34.870
 they arrived centuries ago and it became dark 

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:36.250
 since then I think they are ours 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:39.370
 second place goes to the mortal 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:41.949
 kombat of these people that bad dubbing 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:43.959
 done not only from the vítmas has some 

00:03:41.949 --> 00:03:47.109
 characters very practically on the side 

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:48.699
 It's crazy, I really did not expect it. 

00:03:47.109 --> 00:03:51.549
 of what the singer delivered in the dubbing 

00:03:48.699 --> 00:03:53.530
 would not it be the same guy I really 

00:03:51.549 --> 00:03:55.840
 waited for the request of those radioactive 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:58.000
 they only open bar party more macdonald's 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:00.129
 produce but I did not imagine that 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.230
 production itself and have a quality as 

00:04:00.129 --> 00:04:04.629
 under an organ it is to be congratulated 

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:05.590
 really deserves the pichichi dp trophy 

00:04:04.629 --> 00:04:08.680
 rock 

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:11.620
 why is occurring trophy roger worst 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:13.209
 pitt for the eric sanction but anyway she 

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:15.549
 really stepped on the ball and what is a 

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:18.310
 something weird because exaggerate so 

00:04:15.549 --> 00:04:20.349
 inside conmebol climbed fashion and by 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:23.080
 least in the case of mortal kombat the script was 

00:04:20.349 --> 00:04:25.630
 adapted donors to are shitting 

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:27.070
 is happening at last seems to you that 

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:29.050
 they really did it just to 

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:31.330
 to earn that taxable slaughter that 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:32.979
 producers win when they launch a 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:34.630
 error when language across the 

00:04:32.979 --> 00:04:37.240
 Subtitles in portuguese 

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:39.590
 what will be the options that were the fans or the 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:43.580
 tax cuts you decide 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:46.160
 a sober and with defeat you must 

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:47.870
 to be very know the fine comes from 

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:52.730
 teach I think it will accomplish your 

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:55.730
 face and the great champion in our trophy 

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:58.550
 roger from the worst pitié and releases the movie 

00:04:55.730 --> 00:05:00.530
 arlen that speaking for a trophy takes advantage 

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:03.590
 and give one more to horner just for the 

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:05.960
 dubbing of beautiful movie tongue stuck them 

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:09.140
 they decided to put roger because it was 

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:12.080
 of quotation marks the emblem of the fight of the 

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:13.820
 brazil against corruption a game that 

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:15.500
 shows the police underworld 

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:17.600
 corruption and everything else the plan is that he 

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:19.610
 really is not a donor 

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:21.260
 the guy has a diction that can be 

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:23.750
 worse than mine we were 

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:26.300
 talking and that even he has 

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:28.970
 still present at the end of the beautiful accounts 

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:31.160
 dubbed movie on the thighs still deserves 

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:33.770
 our worst pitt roger trophy because the 

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:36.200
 service to release the film just dumb 

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:38.360
 young man and his statements 

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:39.770
 against who criticized this work 

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:41.630
 he made it 

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:44.180
 have been able to transform any kind of 

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:46.100
 respect I had of him and negative 

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:50.060
 so much respect for work 

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:57.200
 his professional with the person left 

00:05:50.060 --> 00:06:00.020
 the rapid control port is doing 

00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:01.640
 Taking care of the talk, I'll stay here. 

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:03.590
 I hope you enjoyed today 

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:05.510
 Short film in favor of leaving 

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:08.480
 comments and do not accept any 

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:09.470
 only because he is in 

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:10.670
 Portuguese 

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:12.320
 after all if you had not 

00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:13.970
 food yesterday someone offering a dish 

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:17.330
 of food a body in the middle you go 

00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:18.920
 eat so that it does not exactly run 

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:21.770
 same thing in the games you 're paying 

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:24.410
 so you bastard then you in 

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:27.830
 The minimum you have the right to 

00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:31.720
 quality even more for $ 250 in people 

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:31.720
 so that's what we kisses
