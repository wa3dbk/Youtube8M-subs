to be having a look at something that

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:07.730 
to be having a look at something that
I've<00:00:06.270> been<00:00:06.450> hanging<00:00:06.660> out<00:00:06.839> for<00:00:07.109> for<00:00:07.410> a<00:00:07.470> very

I've been hanging out for for a very

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.700 
I've been hanging out for for a very
long<00:00:07.980> time<00:00:08.010> in<00:00:08.660> the<00:00:09.660> Marvel<00:00:10.019> world<00:00:10.260> in<00:00:10.620> the

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710 
long time in the Marvel world in the

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:12.520 
long time in the Marvel world in the
Marvel<00:00:10.980> Universe<00:00:11.010> world<00:00:11.550> even<00:00:11.880> just<00:00:12.059> for

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:12.530 
Marvel Universe world even just for

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:14.990 
Marvel Universe world even just for
having<00:00:13.530> on<00:00:13.620> the<00:00:13.740> shelf<00:00:14.009> display<00:00:14.429> world<00:00:14.730> and

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
having on the shelf display world and

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.180 
having on the shelf display world and
that<00:00:15.089> is<00:00:15.210> a<00:00:15.450> Infinity<00:00:16.109> Gauntlet<00:00:16.139> as<00:00:16.650> worn<00:00:16.980> by

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
that is a Infinity Gauntlet as worn by

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.990 
that is a Infinity Gauntlet as worn by
Thanos<00:00:17.940> and<00:00:18.180> as<00:00:19.140> you<00:00:19.289> can<00:00:19.439> see<00:00:19.650> here<00:00:20.039> just<00:00:20.789> like

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
Thanos and as you can see here just like

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.349 
Thanos and as you can see here just like
the<00:00:21.180> big<00:00:21.359> foam<00:00:21.689> Hulk<00:00:22.109> hands<00:00:22.410> and<00:00:23.060> thing<00:00:24.060> hands

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
the big foam Hulk hands and thing hands

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:25.849 
the big foam Hulk hands and thing hands
and<00:00:24.720> I<00:00:24.750> think<00:00:24.960> they<00:00:25.050> breed<00:00:25.289> released<00:00:25.560> the<00:00:25.680> Hulk

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
and I think they breed released the Hulk

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.670 
and I think they breed released the Hulk
hands<00:00:26.099> for<00:00:26.340> The<00:00:26.430> Avengers<00:00:26.490> movie<00:00:27.080> at<00:00:28.080> the<00:00:28.140> San

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
you do a bit of a Google search for

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.240 
you do a bit of a Google search for
Infinity<00:00:55.920> Gauntlet<00:00:56.270> SD<00:00:57.270> CC<00:00:58.140> 2014<00:00:58.649> you'll

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
it being sold on its own and it is

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.469 
it being sold on its own and it is
brilliant<00:01:07.799> as<00:01:08.189> I<00:01:08.280> said<00:01:08.460> it<00:01:08.610> fits<00:01:09.240> quite<00:01:09.360> nicely

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
brilliant as I said it fits quite nicely

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.600 
brilliant as I said it fits quite nicely
onto<00:01:10.080> the<00:01:10.170> hand<00:01:10.350> there<00:01:10.590> so<00:01:10.860> there's<00:01:11.250> my<00:01:11.430> arm

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
onto the hand there so there's my arm

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.200 
onto the hand there so there's my arm
going<00:01:11.880> in<00:01:12.119> and<00:01:12.950> it<00:01:13.950> really<00:01:14.220> does<00:01:14.460> look<00:01:15.090> great

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
going in and it really does look great

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.390 
going in and it really does look great
it's<00:01:15.479> basically<00:01:15.840> for<00:01:15.990> the<00:01:16.049> left<00:01:16.200> hand<00:01:16.500> so<00:01:17.340> you

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
it's basically for the left hand so you

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:18.499 
it's basically for the left hand so you
can't<00:01:17.759> wear<00:01:17.850> it<00:01:17.939> on<00:01:18.030> your<00:01:18.150> right<00:01:18.270> hand<00:01:18.390> I

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
can't wear it on your right hand I

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.330 
can't wear it on your right hand I
suppose<00:01:18.600> you<00:01:18.840> can<00:01:19.020> but<00:01:19.229> it<00:01:19.770> look<00:01:19.979> a<00:01:20.040> bit<00:01:20.070> weird

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
suppose you can but it look a bit weird

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.539 
suppose you can but it look a bit weird
and<00:01:20.970> you<00:01:21.090> can<00:01:21.240> see<00:01:21.390> the<00:01:22.040> fingers<00:01:23.040> there<00:01:23.369> in<00:01:23.460> the

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
and you can see the fingers there in the

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.760 
and you can see the fingers there in the
molding<00:01:23.880> so<00:01:24.450> for<00:01:25.049> those<00:01:25.140> who<00:01:25.350> don't<00:01:25.710> know

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
molding so for those who don't know

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.140 
molding so for those who don't know
about<00:01:26.040> the<00:01:26.220> impending<00:01:26.430> gauntlets

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
about the impending gauntlets

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.289 
about the impending gauntlets
it's<00:01:27.840> basically<00:01:28.229> what<00:01:29.130> Thanos<00:01:29.460> is<00:01:29.640> trying<00:01:30.000> to

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
it's basically what Thanos is trying to

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:33.319 
it's basically what Thanos is trying to
to<00:01:31.140> always<00:01:31.500> have<00:01:31.770> to<00:01:32.040> control<00:01:32.579> the<00:01:32.729> stones<00:01:33.000> or

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
to always have to control the stones or

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.929 
to always have to control the stones or
the<00:01:33.360> soul<00:01:33.810> gems<00:01:34.250> so<00:01:35.250> he<00:01:35.400> can<00:01:35.549> control<00:01:35.820> the

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
the soul gems so he can control the

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:38.569 
the soul gems so he can control the
universe<00:01:36.240> and<00:01:36.540> so<00:01:37.079> each<00:01:37.259> gem<00:01:37.979> has<00:01:38.189> a<00:01:38.220> different

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
universe and so each gem has a different

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:39.830 
universe and so each gem has a different
power<00:01:38.759> so<00:01:39.090> the<00:01:39.240> one<00:01:39.360> on<00:01:39.450> the<00:01:39.509> back<00:01:39.630> here<00:01:39.810> you

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
power so the one on the back here you

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.810 
power so the one on the back here you
can<00:01:39.960> see<00:01:40.079> is<00:01:40.290> green<00:01:40.590> which<00:01:41.280> allows<00:01:41.610> the<00:01:41.790> user

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
can see is green which allows the user

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.639 
can see is green which allows the user
to<00:01:42.030> steal<00:01:42.390> control<00:01:42.750> manipulate<00:01:43.200> and<00:01:43.350> alter

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
to steal control manipulate and alter

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:46.010 
to steal control manipulate and alter
souls<00:01:43.920> living<00:01:44.310> or<00:01:44.490> dead<00:01:44.670> the<00:01:45.570> orange<00:01:45.840> one

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
souls living or dead the orange one

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.200 
souls living or dead the orange one
