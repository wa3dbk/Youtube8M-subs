cabin<00:01:43.930> filter<00:01:44.110> that<00:01:44.619> I<00:01:44.770> installed<00:01:45.190> about<00:01:45.490> a

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:45.520 
cabin filter that I installed about a

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:48.150 
cabin filter that I installed about a

year ago and when you pull it out it's
kind<00:01:48.369> of<00:01:48.460> tight<00:01:48.789> fit<00:01:49.149> but<00:01:49.450> it'll<00:01:50.140> turn<00:01:51.090> and

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:52.090 
kind of tight fit but it'll turn and

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:58.050 
kind of tight fit but it'll turn and
then<00:01:52.960> slide<00:01:53.289> the<00:01:53.470> rest<00:01:53.710> of<00:01:53.830> the<00:01:53.890> way<00:01:54.070> out<00:01:57.060> this

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:58.060 
then slide the rest of the way out this

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:02.240 
then slide the rest of the way out this
is<00:01:58.240> a<00:01:58.270> close-up<00:01:58.840> of<00:01:58.990> some<00:01:59.050> of<00:01:59.320> the<00:01:59.380> junk<00:01:59.770> that

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:07.380 

the<00:02:03.250> cabin<00:02:03.700> filter<00:02:03.970> catches

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:07.390 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:11.280 

it's<00:02:07.870> really<00:02:08.170> pretty<00:02:08.680> full<00:02:09.840> after<00:02:10.840> a<00:02:10.869> year

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:11.290 
it's really pretty full after a year

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:14.040 
it's really pretty full after a year
looks<00:02:12.010> like<00:02:12.250> probably<00:02:12.970> a<00:02:13.120> mouse<00:02:13.420> chewed<00:02:13.870> on<00:02:14.020> a

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:14.050 
looks like probably a mouse chewed on a

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:18.780 
looks like probably a mouse chewed on a
little<00:02:14.350> bit<00:02:14.470> there<00:02:14.680> -<00:02:17.100> it's<00:02:18.100> a<00:02:18.190> shot<00:02:18.460> of<00:02:18.670> the

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
little bit there - it's a shot of the

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:21.020 
little bit there - it's a shot of the
old<00:02:18.970> filter<00:02:19.300> and<00:02:19.690> the<00:02:19.780> new<00:02:19.930> filter<00:02:20.230> and

old filter and the new filter and

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:24.840 
old filter and the new filter and
believe<00:02:22.030> it<00:02:22.150> or<00:02:22.210> not<00:02:22.390> that<00:02:23.250> old<00:02:24.250> filter<00:02:24.520> looked

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:24.850 
believe it or not that old filter looked

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:27.090 
believe it or not that old filter looked
like<00:02:25.030> the<00:02:25.180> new<00:02:25.330> one<00:02:25.540> when<00:02:26.260> I<00:02:26.290> put<00:02:26.530> it<00:02:26.650> in<00:02:26.800> a<00:02:26.890> year
