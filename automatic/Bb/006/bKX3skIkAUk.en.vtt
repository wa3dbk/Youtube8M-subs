00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.359
 Y 

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:11.270
 active if anything the breast is that such as 

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:14.090
 you are hoping that very well in this 

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:18.590
 you have me here in the kitchen and 

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:21.800
 let's prepare a ham cake and 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:23.990
 cheese or a ham and cheese cake 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:27.859
 the ingredients that we are going to need 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:30.949
 they are by all means and the main thing 

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:33.560
 is the broken dough I bought this 

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:36.650
 in the leader we need two because each 

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:39.290
 one has one and then we have to 

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:42.080
 put one under and another up ham 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:43.940
 sweet cheese that is well founded in this 

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:47.110
 help case that I like a lot and it's very 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:50.180
 tasty margarine or butter 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:53.270
 peas if you like it if it's not the same as 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:55.270
 you can replace with olives and eggs 

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:58.570
 hard it 

00:00:55.270 --> 00:01:01.840
 before we start we have to have a 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:05.020
 mold I'm going to use this one that's going 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:07.240
 very well and the butter has already 

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:09.760
 butter and now he wants it is 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:11.920
 Flourish is worth it for when 

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:12.850
 when we put the dough does not stay 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:15.250
 glued 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:18.700
 this is super super fast food 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:21.729
 light and also that it can take us out of 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:23.670
 a hurry so if you want to see how 

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:27.580
 I 'm preparing to stay for what I'm going to start 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:30.790
 then we are going to put the mold that already 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:34.720
 has butter flour a little bit 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:37.080
 of flour like this and we're going to 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:40.710
 be good 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:44.480
 so we have it so let's take one of 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:47.870
 the bases of the broken mass 

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:49.640
 and we are going to stretch it on our 

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:54.040
 tray 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:56.290
 so if you do not have a mold of these 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:59.270
 nothing happens nothing you can use 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:02.420
 a pires or the oven tray 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:05.930
 square is what you want it I 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:11.679
 I will do in this then now what we are going 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:11.679
 to do what we're going to do is 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:19.260
 Now what I'm going to do is put 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:24.200
 first sweet ham we stretch it well 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:30.760
 and we cover the entire surface 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:30.760
 I'm going to put the cheese in the same way 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:35.880
 if you want you can also add the 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:38.040
 olives 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:41.330
 I will not put olives today but 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:46.580
 I usually prepare it with olives 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:49.850
 and now up I'll put the peas and 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:51.920
 the egg so that when melted they remain 

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:54.330
 pegaditos and when we cut it we do not know 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:56.340
 come out everything's worth 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:57.900
 with the clean little hands of the 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:00.630
 kitchen to work with hands that do not 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:03.450
 always very clean and with eggs 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:05.610
 you can chop it or I simply contribute 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:09.890
 a little 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:09.890
 and I strain it for the whole mix 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:17.740
 if you leave more or less a finger in the 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:21.520
 tip better because after we have 

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:23.250
 to make the crease and if you do not go us 

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:26.070
 look good 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:28.320
 and now we can put another layer 

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:30.810
 cheese syrup so that the egg is left 

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:33.560
 also subject is not needed so much with 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:33.560
 two that we put 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:37.879
 and now 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:44.870
 let's put the other broken dough 

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:47.540
 for weapons 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:51.010
 I put it upside down and the paper up 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:51.010
 so that it does not break 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:55.810
 we put more or less one above the 

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:58.690
 other 

00:03:55.810 --> 00:04:02.110
 these 

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:04.990
 to see if it looks good I will move so that 

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:08.520
 see how I do the repulgation that is 

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:12.040
 it says in my land is worth in the fold 

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:14.430
 we join together and what we are going to do 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:17.039
 is to go spinning 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:21.239
 and we help ourselves from these of the tweezers 

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:25.169
 I tell him and we are turning that we 

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:28.229
 this double basket is going to be this 

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:32.280
 simply with a fork you take the 

00:04:28.229 --> 00:04:35.310
 tip and tighten and is already on 

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:39.000
 all watch that is well closed for 

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:41.400
 that the cheese does not escape once the 

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.650
 we have like that there are people who paint it with 

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:46.440
 the egg with the yolk on top 

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:51.560
 I in this case will not do it and something very 

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:55.169
 important so that we are not told the 

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:59.240
 dough when it's cooking is to give it 

00:04:55.169 --> 00:05:02.280
 small with a pin prick 

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:05.729
 to mark a little bit and then not 

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:09.990
 inflate now we leave it in the oven in 

00:05:05.729 --> 00:05:13.289
 the middle part more or less for about 

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:14.970
 10 minutes or so 15 you just have to go 

00:05:13.289 --> 00:05:17.400
 seeing because you think that the inside 

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:19.409
 that's all you have to do 

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:21.959
 to do is to melt the cheese a little 

00:05:19.409 --> 00:05:23.809
 and turning the yellow one has taken him out of the 

00:05:21.959 --> 00:05:26.939
 oven as you see has a pint 

00:05:23.809 --> 00:05:28.589
 very good and now below you 

00:05:26.939 --> 00:05:31.649
 I will leave some pictures because now I still 

00:05:28.589 --> 00:05:33.149
 in the afternoon I'm not going to leave and when 

00:05:31.649 --> 00:05:35.309
 the section will leave a photo so that 

00:05:33.149 --> 00:05:37.289
 see how it is inside is worth to 

00:05:35.309 --> 00:05:40.229
 continuation of what I am showing 

00:05:37.289 --> 00:05:42.479
 Now I hope you liked it 

00:05:40.229 --> 00:05:44.819
 put in practice any doubt 

00:05:42.479 --> 00:05:47.249
