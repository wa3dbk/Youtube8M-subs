00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
know some really big amateur events so a

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.899 
know some really big amateur events so a
lot<00:01:15.630> lots<00:01:15.930> of<00:01:16.080> great<00:01:16.229> talent<00:01:16.490> as<00:01:17.490> far<00:01:17.729> as<00:01:17.820> the

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
lot lots of great talent as far as the

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.539 
lot lots of great talent as far as the
lefty/righty<00:01:18.330> goes<00:01:18.900> I<00:01:19.320> think<00:01:20.250> the<00:01:20.369> oil

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
lefty/righty goes I think the oil

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.550 
lefty/righty goes I think the oil
pattern<00:01:20.729> is<00:01:21.000> such<00:01:21.210> that<00:01:21.450> it<00:01:21.509> lends<00:01:21.869> itself<00:01:22.259> to

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
pattern is such that it lends itself to

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.170 
pattern is such that it lends itself to
both<00:01:23.009> sides<00:01:23.189> of<00:01:23.400> the<00:01:23.490> lane<00:01:23.670> I<00:01:23.700> think<00:01:24.000> it's<00:01:24.119> a

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
both sides of the lane I think it's a

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.999 
both sides of the lane I think it's a
very<00:01:24.299> fair<00:01:24.659> oil<00:01:25.200> pattern<00:01:25.500> I<00:01:25.740> think<00:01:25.920> the

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
very fair oil pattern I think the

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:27.859 
very fair oil pattern I think the
players<00:01:26.220> can<00:01:26.549> stay<00:01:27.090> far<00:01:27.299> enough<00:01:27.390> right<00:01:27.659> so<00:01:27.780> you

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
players can stay far enough right so you

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:29.330 
players can stay far enough right so you
don't<00:01:28.020> see<00:01:28.170> you<00:01:28.680> know<00:01:28.770> the<00:01:28.860> power<00:01:29.070> players

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
don't see you know the power players
