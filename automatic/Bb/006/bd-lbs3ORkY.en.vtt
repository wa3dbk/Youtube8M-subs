so the lurk is the third alien life-form
like<00:00:10.980> I<00:00:11.070> said<00:00:11.250> it<00:00:11.370> costs<00:00:11.610> 30<00:00:11.849> personal

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
like I said it costs 30 personal

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:14.539 
like I said it costs 30 personal
resources<00:00:12.929> to<00:00:13.230> evolve<00:00:13.590> into<00:00:13.980> it<00:00:14.160> has<00:00:14.519> a

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
resources to evolve into it has a

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:17.359 
resources to evolve into it has a
hundred<00:00:15.059> 25<00:00:15.420> health<00:00:15.630> and<00:00:15.839> fifty<00:00:16.170> armor<00:00:17.160> or

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
hundred 25 health and fifty armor or

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:19.040 
hundred 25 health and fifty armor or
carapace<00:00:17.760> as<00:00:18.000> of<00:00:18.150> this<00:00:18.270> latest<00:00:18.570> patch<00:00:18.720> build

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
carapace as of this latest patch build

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:20.720 
carapace as of this latest patch build
two<00:00:19.230> three<00:00:19.439> -<00:00:19.590> that<00:00:19.800> changes<00:00:20.039> fairly<00:00:20.460> often

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
two three - that changes fairly often

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.689 
two three - that changes fairly often
but<00:00:21.090> so<00:00:21.449> it's<00:00:21.600> pretty<00:00:21.779> weak<00:00:22.100> more<00:00:23.100> armor<00:00:23.490> and

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
but so it's pretty weak more armor and

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:25.580 
but so it's pretty weak more armor and
health<00:00:24.000> than<00:00:24.180> a<00:00:24.269> skulk<00:00:24.570> but<00:00:25.140> it's<00:00:25.350> not

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
health than a skulk but it's not

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.349 
health than a skulk but it's not
difficult<00:00:26.070> to<00:00:26.130> take<00:00:26.310> a<00:00:26.369> look<00:00:26.580> down<00:00:26.789> if<00:00:27.060> you<00:00:27.180> can

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
difficult to take a look down if you can

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.060 
difficult to take a look down if you can
hit<00:00:27.480> it<00:00:27.689> the<00:00:28.050> difficulty<00:00:28.470> though<00:00:28.590> is<00:00:28.769> hitting

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
hit it the difficulty though is hitting

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.519 
hit it the difficulty though is hitting
it<00:00:29.189> because<00:00:29.490> the<00:00:29.609> lurk<00:00:29.760> can<00:00:30.090> fly<00:00:30.390> that's<00:00:31.289> what

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
it because the lurk can fly that's what

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.310 
it because the lurk can fly that's what
the<00:00:31.619> wings<00:00:31.830> are<00:00:32.160> for<00:00:33.020> those<00:00:34.020> are<00:00:34.200> not

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
the wings are for those are not

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.319 
the wings are for those are not
vestigial<00:00:34.680> wings<00:00:34.980> so<00:00:35.399> we're<00:00:35.969> going<00:00:36.090> to<00:00:36.239> learn

green<00:01:43.710> on<00:01:43.950> your<00:01:43.979> screen<00:01:44.579> on<00:01:44.850> a<00:01:44.909> marine<00:01:45.329> the

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
green on your screen on a marine the

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.109 
green on your screen on a marine the
screen<00:01:45.899> is<00:01:46.170> like<00:01:46.320> a<00:01:46.380> poisonous<00:01:47.310> toxic<00:01:47.880> cloud

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
screen is like a poisonous toxic cloud

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:49.670 
screen is like a poisonous toxic cloud
of<00:01:48.270> gas<00:01:48.420> that<00:01:48.659> they<00:01:48.780> can't<00:01:48.990> see<00:01:49.170> through<00:01:49.350> and

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
of gas that they can't see through and

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.069 
of gas that they can't see through and
it<00:01:50.250> also<00:01:50.369> hurts<00:01:50.670> them<00:01:50.880> so<00:01:51.119> if<00:01:51.450> you<00:01:51.509> get<00:01:51.960> this

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
it also hurts them so if you get this

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:55.760 
it also hurts them so if you get this
stuff<00:01:52.350> on<00:01:53.390> a<00:01:54.390> Marine<00:01:54.899> they<00:01:55.259> will<00:01:55.409> take<00:01:55.530> damage

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
stuff on a Marine they will take damage

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:56.990 
stuff on a Marine they will take damage
while<00:01:56.070> they're<00:01:56.189> standing<00:01:56.520> in<00:01:56.610> it<00:01:56.729> so<00:01:56.880> they

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
while they're standing in it so they

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.149 
while they're standing in it so they
have<00:01:57.119> to<00:01:57.270> leave<00:01:57.420> or<00:01:57.659> Die<00:01:57.869> Another<00:01:58.110> which<00:01:58.950> are

marine fires 50 bullets at this only 25

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:30.110 
marine fires 50 bullets at this only 25
will<00:02:28.530> do<00:02:28.650> any<00:02:28.799> damage<00:02:29.040> the<00:02:29.340> other<00:02:29.489> 25<00:02:29.879> will

will do any damage the other 25 will
fade<00:02:30.450> into<00:02:30.659> nothingness<00:02:31.079> this<00:02:31.650> will<00:02:31.829> be<00:02:32.329> d

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:33.329 
fade into nothingness this will be d

00:02:33.329 --> 00:02:36.289 
fade into nothingness this will be d
this<00:02:33.989> will<00:02:34.170> be<00:02:34.610> what's<00:02:35.610> the<00:02:35.790> word<00:02:35.970> a

00:02:36.289 --> 00:02:36.299 
this will be what's the word a

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:38.509 
this will be what's the word a
flamethrower<00:02:36.780> will<00:02:37.440> stop<00:02:37.709> this<00:02:37.920> from<00:02:38.129> working

00:02:38.509 --> 00:02:38.519 
flamethrower will stop this from working

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:40.309 
flamethrower will stop this from working
it<00:02:38.730> will<00:02:38.879> be<00:02:39.060> there's<00:02:39.690> a<00:02:39.780> word<00:02:39.989> to<00:02:40.200> describe

00:02:40.309 --> 00:02:40.319 
it will be there's a word to describe

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:43.009 
it will be there's a word to describe
that<00:02:40.680> but<00:02:40.920> yeah<00:02:41.519> if<00:02:41.760> you<00:02:42.299> get<00:02:42.450> flamethrower

00:02:43.009 --> 00:02:43.019 
that but yeah if you get flamethrower

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:44.660 
that but yeah if you get flamethrower
word<00:02:43.140> while<00:02:43.349> you're<00:02:43.500> in<00:02:43.590> a<00:02:43.680> number<00:02:43.950> or<00:02:44.430> the

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
word while you're in a number or the

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:46.190 
word while you're in a number or the
Umbra<00:02:45.000> will<00:02:45.150> go<00:02:45.299> away

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
Umbra will go away

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:47.990 
Umbra will go away
but<00:02:46.440> that's<00:02:46.590> very<00:02:46.709> useful<00:02:47.069> it's<00:02:47.430> in<00:02:47.609> create

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
but that's very useful it's in create

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.430 
but that's very useful it's in create
extremely<00:02:48.450> useful<00:02:48.780> for<00:02:48.810> supporting<00:02:49.349> an

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
extremely useful for supporting an

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:50.960 
extremely useful for supporting an
illness<00:02:49.590> for<00:02:49.980> example<00:02:50.160> because<00:02:50.579> it<00:02:50.700> gives<00:02:50.849> the

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
illness for example because it gives the

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:53.420 
illness for example because it gives the
Ono's<00:02:51.239> basically<00:02:51.690> double<00:02:52.019> the<00:02:52.170> life<00:02:52.430> because

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
Ono's basically double the life because

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:54.740 
Ono's basically double the life because
it<00:02:53.549> takes<00:02:53.730> twice<00:02:53.879> as<00:02:53.940> many<00:02:54.209> bullets<00:02:54.390> to<00:02:54.629> kill

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
it takes twice as many bullets to kill

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:56.990 
it takes twice as many bullets to kill
the<00:02:54.840> Ono<00:02:55.079> so<00:02:55.349> that's<00:02:56.129> helpful<00:02:56.400> so<00:02:56.700> now<00:02:56.819> we'll

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
the Ono so that's helpful so now we'll

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.330 
the Ono so that's helpful so now we'll
learn<00:02:57.150> basic<00:02:57.569> lurk<00:02:57.750> movement<00:02:58.290> the<00:02:58.769> lurk<00:02:59.040> can

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
learn basic lurk movement the lurk can

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:01.069 
learn basic lurk movement the lurk can
walk<00:02:59.489> around<00:02:59.760> on<00:03:00.030> the<00:03:00.180> ground<00:03:00.359> but<00:03:00.599> honestly<00:03:00.989> I

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:01.079 
walk around on the ground but honestly I

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:02.869 
walk around on the ground but honestly I
cannot<00:03:01.530> think<00:03:01.769> of<00:03:01.920> any<00:03:02.099> reason<00:03:02.489> for<00:03:02.519> the<00:03:02.730> lurk

00:03:02.869 --> 00:03:02.879 
cannot think of any reason for the lurk

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:05.059 
cannot think of any reason for the lurk
to<00:03:03.090> ever<00:03:03.239> do<00:03:03.450> this<00:03:03.599> you<00:03:04.319> hit<00:03:04.470> the<00:03:04.560> spacebar<00:03:04.799> and

00:03:05.059 --> 00:03:05.069 
to ever do this you hit the spacebar and

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:06.319 
to ever do this you hit the spacebar and
you'll<00:03:05.340> flap<00:03:05.549> your<00:03:05.700> wings<00:03:05.760> you<00:03:06.090> hit<00:03:06.239> the

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:06.329 
you'll flap your wings you hit the

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:07.640 
you'll flap your wings you hit the
spacebar<00:03:06.569> twice<00:03:06.900> and<00:03:07.200> you'll<00:03:07.290> flap<00:03:07.500> your

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
spacebar twice and you'll flap your

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:09.410 
spacebar twice and you'll flap your
wings<00:03:07.709> twice<00:03:08.129> and<00:03:08.489> if<00:03:08.760> you<00:03:08.849> keep<00:03:09.090> hitting<00:03:09.329> the

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:09.420 
wings twice and if you keep hitting the

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:11.240 
wings twice and if you keep hitting the
spacebar<00:03:09.629> you<00:03:09.959> will<00:03:10.079> keep<00:03:10.260> flapping<00:03:10.680> and<00:03:10.829> then

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
spacebar you will keep flapping and then

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:13.309 
spacebar you will keep flapping and then
you<00:03:11.370> can<00:03:11.519> you<00:03:11.640> use<00:03:12.030> your<00:03:12.060> movement<00:03:12.629> keys<00:03:12.840> to

00:03:13.309 --> 00:03:13.319 
you can you use your movement keys to

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:14.990 
you can you use your movement keys to
fly<00:03:13.590> around<00:03:13.829> the<00:03:14.159> level<00:03:14.430> so<00:03:14.670> while<00:03:14.849> you're

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
fly around the level so while you're

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.780 
fly around the level so while you're
flapping<00:03:15.209> you<00:03:15.510> just<00:03:15.720> aim<00:03:15.900> your<00:03:16.079> mouse<00:03:16.260> and<00:03:16.790> you

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790 
flapping you just aim your mouse and you

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:19.940 
flapping you just aim your mouse and you
can<00:03:18.090> go<00:03:18.239> wherever<00:03:18.569> you<00:03:18.780> want<00:03:18.959> to<00:03:19.109> your<00:03:19.530> strafe

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:19.950 
can go wherever you want to your strafe

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:21.620 
can go wherever you want to your strafe
buttons<00:03:20.370> will<00:03:20.579> sort<00:03:20.819> of<00:03:20.880> strafe<00:03:21.150> you<00:03:21.329> through

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:21.630 
buttons will sort of strafe you through

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:24.740 
buttons will sort of strafe you through
the<00:03:21.750> air<00:03:21.900> I'm<00:03:22.169> not<00:03:22.980> sure<00:03:23.250> how<00:03:23.489> often<00:03:23.880> expert

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:24.750 
the air I'm not sure how often expert

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:27.289 
the air I'm not sure how often expert
lurk<00:03:24.989> players<00:03:25.319> use<00:03:25.650> those<00:03:25.919> I'm<00:03:26.910> mostly<00:03:27.209> just

00:03:27.289 --> 00:03:27.299 
lurk players use those I'm mostly just

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:29.509 
lurk players use those I'm mostly just
aim<00:03:27.599> where<00:03:27.840> I<00:03:27.870> want<00:03:28.169> to<00:03:28.260> go<00:03:28.379> you<00:03:29.099> can<00:03:29.250> use<00:03:29.370> the

00:03:29.509 --> 00:03:29.519 
aim where I want to go you can use the

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:30.890 
aim where I want to go you can use the
strafe<00:03:29.760> buttons<00:03:30.090> for<00:03:30.239> very<00:03:30.419> minor<00:03:30.599> course

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
strafe buttons for very minor course

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:32.330 
strafe buttons for very minor course
correction<00:03:31.349> so<00:03:31.500> you<00:03:31.560> don't<00:03:31.829> have<00:03:32.010> to<00:03:32.190> keep

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:32.340 
correction so you don't have to keep

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:33.289 
correction so you don't have to keep
flapping<00:03:32.819> your<00:03:32.849> wings

00:03:33.289 --> 00:03:33.299 
flapping your wings

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:36.080 
flapping your wings
if<00:03:33.540> you<00:03:33.810> hold<00:03:34.470> spacebar<00:03:35.069> you'll<00:03:35.879> glide

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:36.090 
if you hold spacebar you'll glide

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:37.339 
if you hold spacebar you'll glide
through<00:03:36.329> the<00:03:36.450> air<00:03:36.540> so<00:03:36.569> right<00:03:36.959> now<00:03:37.079> I'm<00:03:37.169> holding

00:03:37.339 --> 00:03:37.349 
through the air so right now I'm holding

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:39.440 
through the air so right now I'm holding
spacebar<00:03:37.919> and<00:03:38.129> if<00:03:38.760> you're<00:03:38.879> gliding<00:03:39.060> and<00:03:39.359> you

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:39.450 
spacebar and if you're gliding and you

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:42.500 
spacebar and if you're gliding and you
aim<00:03:39.569> down<00:03:39.840> you'll<00:03:40.290> gain<00:03:40.470> speed<00:03:40.889> and<00:03:41.129> so<00:03:42.090> diving

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:42.510 
aim down you'll gain speed and so diving

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:44.180 
aim down you'll gain speed and so diving
is<00:03:42.870> a<00:03:42.900> good<00:03:43.079> way<00:03:43.169> to<00:03:43.230> gain<00:03:43.650> speed<00:03:43.889> and<00:03:44.129> if

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:44.190 
is a good way to gain speed and if

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:47.030 
is a good way to gain speed and if
you're<00:03:44.310> if<00:03:45.120> you're<00:03:45.720> gliding<00:03:46.199> and<00:03:46.530> you<00:03:46.620> aim<00:03:46.829> up

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.040 
you're if you're gliding and you aim up

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:48.740 
you're if you're gliding and you aim up
you'll<00:03:47.459> lose<00:03:47.699> a<00:03:47.730> bit<00:03:47.940> of<00:03:48.060> speed<00:03:48.269> depending<00:03:48.690> on

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:48.750 
you'll lose a bit of speed depending on

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:51.800 
you'll lose a bit of speed depending on
how<00:03:48.870> up<00:03:49.109> you<00:03:49.650> are<00:03:49.799> aiming<00:03:50.040> and<00:03:50.370> so<00:03:50.849> you<00:03:51.569> see<00:03:51.720> I'm

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:51.810 
how up you are aiming and so you see I'm

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:53.270 
how up you are aiming and so you see I'm
going<00:03:51.989> slow<00:03:52.260> and<00:03:52.560> then<00:03:52.680> let's<00:03:52.859> dive<00:03:53.040> down<00:03:53.220> and

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:53.280 
going slow and then let's dive down and

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:56.599 
going slow and then let's dive down and
I<00:03:53.519> go<00:03:53.639> fast<00:03:53.910> I<00:03:54.209> go<00:03:54.660> slow<00:03:54.900> and<00:03:55.319> I<00:03:55.410> go<00:03:55.530> fast<00:03:55.949> I<00:03:56.280> go

00:03:56.599 --> 00:03:56.609 
I go fast I go slow and I go fast I go

00:03:56.609 --> 00:03:58.309 
I go fast I go slow and I go fast I go
slow<00:03:56.879> and<00:03:57.120> I<00:03:57.150> go<00:03:57.239> fast<00:03:57.540> in<00:03:57.870> you<00:03:58.109> get<00:03:58.230> the

00:03:58.309 --> 00:03:58.319 
slow and I go fast in you get the

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:00.349 
slow and I go fast in you get the
picture<00:03:58.590> so<00:03:58.739> you<00:03:59.430> can<00:03:59.519> add<00:03:59.669> in<00:03:59.819> a<00:03:59.910> few<00:03:59.940> flaps

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:00.359 
picture so you can add in a few flaps

00:04:00.359 --> 00:04:02.479 
picture so you can add in a few flaps
here<00:04:00.660> and<00:04:00.780> there<00:04:00.959> I<00:04:01.169> get<00:04:01.799> up<00:04:01.919> to<00:04:02.099> sort<00:04:02.340> of<00:04:02.430> a

00:04:02.479 --> 00:04:02.489 
here and there I get up to sort of a

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:04.369 
here and there I get up to sort of a
good<00:04:02.639> speed<00:04:02.879> and<00:04:03.120> then<00:04:03.419> glide<00:04:03.810> around<00:04:03.959> if<00:04:04.290> you

00:04:04.369 --> 00:04:04.379 
good speed and then glide around if you

00:04:04.379 --> 00:04:07.129 
good speed and then glide around if you
hold<00:04:04.560> shift<00:04:04.769> you<00:04:05.639> roost<00:04:05.940> just<00:04:06.599> go<00:04:06.900> to<00:04:06.959> any

00:04:07.129 --> 00:04:07.139 
hold shift you roost just go to any

00:04:07.139 --> 00:04:09.140 
hold shift you roost just go to any
surface<00:04:07.440> hold<00:04:08.190> shift<00:04:08.519> and<00:04:08.790> you'll<00:04:08.910> stick<00:04:09.120> to

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:09.150 
surface hold shift and you'll stick to

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:11.449 
surface hold shift and you'll stick to
the<00:04:09.359> surface<00:04:09.510> and<00:04:09.900> that's<00:04:10.799> pretty<00:04:10.980> cool

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:11.459 
the surface and that's pretty cool

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:12.589 
the surface and that's pretty cool
you<00:04:11.609> can<00:04:11.730> just<00:04:11.879> hang<00:04:12.030> out<00:04:12.120> here<00:04:12.299> as<00:04:12.419> long<00:04:12.540> as

00:04:12.589 --> 00:04:12.599 
you can just hang out here as long as

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:13.759 
you can just hang out here as long as
you<00:04:12.750> want<00:04:12.930> you<00:04:13.079> don't<00:04:13.230> have<00:04:13.410> to<00:04:13.530> hold<00:04:13.709> shift

00:04:13.759 --> 00:04:13.769 
you want you don't have to hold shift

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:16.339 
you want you don't have to hold shift
you<00:04:14.129> just<00:04:14.340> hit<00:04:14.489> shift<00:04:14.699> once<00:04:15.209> and<00:04:15.449> then<00:04:16.109> you'll

00:04:16.339 --> 00:04:16.349 
you just hit shift once and then you'll

00:04:16.349 --> 00:04:18.319 
you just hit shift once and then you'll
cling<00:04:16.560> on<00:04:16.709> until<00:04:17.099> you<00:04:17.220> leave<00:04:17.340> and<00:04:17.609> that's

00:04:18.319 --> 00:04:18.329 
cling on until you leave and that's

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:20.080 
cling on until you leave and that's
pretty<00:04:18.660> great

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:20.090 
pretty great

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:22.360 
pretty great
for<00:04:20.959> doing<00:04:21.079> all<00:04:21.590> sorts<00:04:21.919> of<00:04:21.980> shenanigans

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:22.370 
for doing all sorts of shenanigans

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:24.220 
for doing all sorts of shenanigans
because<00:04:23.060> you<00:04:23.150> can<00:04:23.270> just<00:04:23.450> chill<00:04:23.660> out<00:04:23.720> wherever

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:24.230 
because you can just chill out wherever

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:26.170 
because you can just chill out wherever
you<00:04:24.290> want<00:04:24.470> to<00:04:24.889> do<00:04:25.010> and<00:04:25.340> fire<00:04:25.639> spikes<00:04:25.970> and

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:26.180 
you want to do and fire spikes and

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:28.990 
you want to do and fire spikes and
people<00:04:26.530> so<00:04:27.530> that's<00:04:27.680> basically<00:04:28.520> remove<00:04:28.820> Minh

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:29.000 
people so that's basically remove Minh

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.220 
people so that's basically remove Minh
tanned<00:04:29.210> that's<00:04:29.330> pretty<00:04:29.570> much<00:04:29.660> advanced<00:04:29.990> lurk

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:30.230 
tanned that's pretty much advanced lurk

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:32.710 
tanned that's pretty much advanced lurk
movement<00:04:30.620> to<00:04:30.970> mostly<00:04:31.970> just<00:04:32.210> comes<00:04:32.389> down<00:04:32.600> to

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:32.720 
movement to mostly just comes down to

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:34.890 
movement to mostly just comes down to
getting<00:04:32.810> used<00:04:33.050> to<00:04:33.169> us<00:04:33.230> and<00:04:33.560> timing<00:04:34.400> your<00:04:34.520> bites

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:34.900 
getting used to us and timing your bites

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:38.050 
getting used to us and timing your bites
basics<00:04:35.900> lurk<00:04:36.500> tactics<00:04:37.220> so<00:04:37.580> you're<00:04:37.910> definitely

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:38.060 
basics lurk tactics so you're definitely

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:40.659 
basics lurk tactics so you're definitely
a<00:04:38.330> hit<00:04:38.510> and<00:04:38.690> run<00:04:38.750> support<00:04:39.710> sort<00:04:40.040> of<00:04:40.160> alien

you'll fly in chew on some Marines if

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:44.500 
you'll fly in chew on some Marines if
you<00:04:43.370> got<00:04:43.520> a<00:04:43.550> spark<00:04:43.850> loud<00:04:44.060> you'll<00:04:44.300> want<00:04:44.450> to

00:05:35.419 --> 00:05:37.210 
maybe you can just come by quite a few
times<00:05:35.630> and<00:05:36.050> then<00:05:36.229> leave<00:05:36.470> so<00:05:36.740> that's<00:05:36.979> what<00:05:37.130> the

times and then leave so that's what the

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:39.550 
times and then leave so that's what the
lurk<00:05:37.400> is<00:05:37.580> good<00:05:38.240> for<00:05:38.510> you<00:05:39.050> need<00:05:39.200> to<00:05:39.289> use<00:05:39.410> your

fight back so whenever you have an
escape<00:05:47.810> path<00:05:48.080> which<00:05:48.350> is<00:05:48.380> pretty<00:05:48.620> much<00:05:48.770> all<00:05:48.889> the

00:05:48.969 --> 00:05:48.979 
escape path which is pretty much all the

00:05:48.979 --> 00:05:50.620 
escape path which is pretty much all the
time<00:05:49.010> is<00:05:49.340> what<00:05:49.490> the<00:05:49.580> lurk<00:05:49.729> is<00:05:49.880> good<00:05:50.030> at<00:05:50.120> so<00:05:50.330> drop

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:50.630 
time is what the lurk is good at so drop

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:54.100 
time is what the lurk is good at so drop
some<00:05:50.870> acid<00:05:52.120> drop<00:05:53.120> some<00:05:53.300> what's<00:05:53.690> it<00:05:53.810> called

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:15.300 

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:17.930 

and<00:06:15.740> I<00:06:16.740> remembered<00:06:17.250> one<00:06:17.400> more<00:06:17.550> thing<00:06:17.700> we<00:06:17.850> have

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:17.940 
and I remembered one more thing we have

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:19.910 
and I remembered one more thing we have
to<00:06:18.030> talk<00:06:18.150> about<00:06:18.210> the<00:06:18.450> upgrades<00:06:18.810> so<00:06:19.110> celerity

00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:19.920 
to talk about the upgrades so celerity

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:21.230 
to talk about the upgrades so celerity
and<00:06:20.130> adrenaline<00:06:20.550> pretty<00:06:20.820> much<00:06:20.940> go<00:06:21.090> for

00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:21.240 
and adrenaline pretty much go for

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:23.570 
and adrenaline pretty much go for
celerity<00:06:21.680> adrenaline<00:06:22.680> is<00:06:22.800> nice<00:06:23.070> for<00:06:23.280> dropping

00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:23.580 
celerity adrenaline is nice for dropping

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:25.040 
celerity adrenaline is nice for dropping
more<00:06:23.730> spores<00:06:24.030> and<00:06:24.300> dropping<00:06:24.570> more<00:06:24.690> Umbra's

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:25.050 
more spores and dropping more Umbra's

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:26.600 
more spores and dropping more Umbra's
but<00:06:25.320> basically<00:06:25.710> celerity<00:06:26.190> is<00:06:26.310> much<00:06:26.460> better

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:26.610 
but basically celerity is much better

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:28.730 
but basically celerity is much better
because<00:06:27.030> your<00:06:27.180> survivability<00:06:27.600> is<00:06:28.140> all<00:06:28.320> about

00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:28.740 
because your survivability is all about

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:30.980 
because your survivability is all about
your<00:06:28.950> mobility<00:06:29.250> and<00:06:29.670> celerity<00:06:30.480> obviously

00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:30.990 
your mobility and celerity obviously

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:32.420 
your mobility and celerity obviously
makes<00:06:31.170> you<00:06:31.290> more<00:06:31.440> mobile<00:06:31.710> so<00:06:31.920> go<00:06:32.130> for<00:06:32.280> that

00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:32.430 
makes you more mobile so go for that

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:34.790 
makes you more mobile so go for that
silence<00:06:33.300> camouflage<00:06:33.810> camouflage<00:06:34.320> is

00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:34.800 
silence camouflage camouflage is

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:36.530 
silence camouflage camouflage is
basically<00:06:35.610> useless<00:06:35.850> you're<00:06:36.120> never<00:06:36.300> going<00:06:36.480> to

00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:36.540 
basically useless you're never going to

00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:37.960 
basically useless you're never going to
stay<00:06:36.690> still

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:37.970 
stay still

00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:41.960 
stay still
so<00:06:39.080> get<00:06:40.080> silence<00:06:40.500> I<00:06:40.650> guess<00:06:40.830> you'll<00:06:41.040> be<00:06:41.190> a<00:06:41.220> weird

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:41.970 
so get silence I guess you'll be a weird

00:06:41.970 --> 00:06:44.630 
so get silence I guess you'll be a weird
silent<00:06:42.360> bat<00:06:42.810> creature<00:06:43.170> carapace<00:06:44.100> or<00:06:44.250> regen

00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:44.640 
silent bat creature carapace or regen

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:46.700 
silent bat creature carapace or regen
regen<00:06:45.480> is<00:06:45.570> pretty<00:06:45.750> great<00:06:45.930> because<00:06:45.990> you're

00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:46.710 
regen is pretty great because you're

00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:47.990 
regen is pretty great because you're
going<00:06:46.830> to<00:06:46.920> want<00:06:47.070> to<00:06:47.100> retreat<00:06:47.460> from<00:06:47.640> Baystate

00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:48.000 
going to want to retreat from Baystate

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.260 
going to want to retreat from Baystate
or<00:06:48.180> from<00:06:48.840> a<00:06:48.930> fight<00:06:49.140> to<00:06:49.320> heal<00:06:49.500> up<00:06:49.710> so<00:06:50.270> obviously

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:51.270 
or from a fight to heal up so obviously

00:06:51.270 --> 00:06:52.970 
or from a fight to heal up so obviously
much<00:06:51.750> better<00:06:51.960> than<00:06:52.140> flying<00:06:52.410> back<00:06:52.650> to<00:06:52.740> the<00:06:52.800> hive

00:06:52.970 --> 00:06:52.980 
much better than flying back to the hive

00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:54.980 
much better than flying back to the hive
is<00:06:53.190> just<00:06:53.400> a<00:06:53.490> grab<00:06:53.670> regeneration<00:06:54.210> go<00:06:54.540> roost<00:06:54.810> on

00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:54.990 
is just a grab regeneration go roost on

00:06:54.990 --> 00:06:57.020 
is just a grab regeneration go roost on
a<00:06:55.050> ceiling<00:06:55.860> or<00:06:55.950> something<00:06:56.280> but<00:06:56.850> obviously

00:06:57.020 --> 00:06:57.030 
a ceiling or something but obviously

00:06:57.030 --> 00:06:59.090 
a ceiling or something but obviously
carapace<00:06:57.720> is<00:06:57.900> fairly<00:06:58.200> good<00:06:58.320> because<00:06:58.710> it<00:06:58.950> will

00:06:59.090 --> 00:06:59.100 
carapace is fairly good because it will

00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:00.830 
carapace is fairly good because it will
give<00:06:59.280> you<00:06:59.370> more<00:06:59.520> survivability<00:07:00.090> so<00:07:00.450> try<00:07:00.720> them

00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:00.840 
give you more survivability so try them

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:02.630 
give you more survivability so try them
both<00:07:00.930> out<00:07:01.110> find<00:07:01.950> out<00:07:02.040> which<00:07:02.190> one<00:07:02.340> you<00:07:02.460> like<00:07:02.610> and

00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:02.640 
both out find out which one you like and

00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:04.160 
both out find out which one you like and
if<00:07:02.940> you<00:07:03.000> don't<00:07:03.180> like<00:07:03.330> either<00:07:03.510> then<00:07:03.810> maybe<00:07:04.080> you

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:04.170 
if you don't like either then maybe you

00:07:04.170 --> 00:07:05.270 
if you don't like either then maybe you
shouldn't<00:07:04.380> be<00:07:04.470> playing<00:07:04.590> the<00:07:04.800> lurk<00:07:04.950> in<00:07:05.160> the

00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:05.280 
shouldn't be playing the lurk in the

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:07.700 
shouldn't be playing the lurk in the
first<00:07:05.460> place<00:07:05.780> so<00:07:06.780> yeah<00:07:07.320> that's<00:07:07.620> everything

00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:07.710 
first place so yeah that's everything

00:07:07.710 --> 00:07:10.310 
first place so yeah that's everything
bye
