engine something to do with the

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.810 
engine something to do with the
electronics<00:01:00.449> broke<00:01:01.079> and<00:01:01.379> he<00:01:02.070> pulled<00:01:02.309> off<00:01:02.460> the

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
electronics broke and he pulled off the

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.579 
electronics broke and he pulled off the
side<00:01:03.030> of<00:01:03.059> the<00:01:03.210> track<00:01:03.510> near<00:01:04.170> the<00:01:04.290> end<00:01:04.409> of<00:01:04.530> the

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
side of the track near the end of the

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.190 
side of the track near the end of the
lamp<00:01:04.799> and<00:01:05.090> the<00:01:06.090> hearts<00:01:06.420> of<00:01:06.479> everybody<00:01:06.840> in<00:01:07.110> the

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
lamp and the hearts of everybody in the

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.980 
lamp and the hearts of everybody in the
grandstand<00:01:07.409> just<00:01:07.830> fell<00:01:08.130> and<00:01:08.540> at<00:01:09.540> that<00:01:09.630> point

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
grandstand just fell and at that point

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.200 
grandstand just fell and at that point
Hamilton<00:01:10.770> took<00:01:10.920> the<00:01:11.070> lead<00:01:11.220> with<00:01:11.430> grows<00:01:11.760> on<00:01:12.030> and

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
Hamilton took the lead with grows on and

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.030 
Hamilton took the lead with grows on and
I<00:01:12.689> think<00:01:12.720> Alonso<00:01:13.290> was<00:01:13.470> right<00:01:13.619> up<00:01:13.740> there<00:01:13.770> as

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
I think Alonso was right up there as

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.330 
I think Alonso was right up there as
well<00:01:14.250> then<00:01:15.000> a<00:01:15.030> couple<00:01:15.330> of<00:01:15.570> laps<00:01:15.750> that<00:01:16.020> later

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:16.340 
well then a couple of laps that later

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:19.550 
well then a couple of laps that later
after<00:01:17.340> Grosjean<00:01:18.049> persistently<00:01:19.049> kept

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
after Grosjean persistently kept

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.100 
after Grosjean persistently kept
attacking<00:01:19.770> Hamilton<00:01:20.549> his<00:01:21.330> engine<00:01:21.720> went<00:01:21.990> as

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
attacking Hamilton his engine went as

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.690 
attacking Hamilton his engine went as
well<00:01:22.320> and<00:01:22.890> it's<00:01:23.009> something<00:01:23.159> through<00:01:23.549> the

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
well and it's something through the

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.640 
well and it's something through the
electronics<00:01:24.150> as<00:01:24.240> well<00:01:24.420> so<00:01:24.600> it<00:01:24.720> similar

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
electronics as well so it similar

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.679 
electronics as well so it similar
problems<00:01:26.040> with<00:01:26.220> Vettel<00:01:26.549> and<00:01:26.610> grosser<00:01:26.880> on<00:01:27.090> very

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
problems with Vettel and grosser on very

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.050 
problems with Vettel and grosser on very
sad<00:01:27.990> that<00:01:28.200> both<00:01:28.439> of<00:01:28.470> them<00:01:28.680> had<00:01:28.829> to<00:01:28.950> happen<00:01:29.310> but

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
sad that both of them had to happen but

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.030 
sad that both of them had to happen but
it<00:01:30.329> just<00:01:30.540> didn't<00:01:30.869> mean<00:01:31.020> that<00:01:31.229> the<00:01:31.290> top<00:01:31.560> two<00:01:31.799> now

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
it just didn't mean that the top two now

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.450 
it just didn't mean that the top two now
will<00:01:32.790> Hamilton<00:01:33.000> and<00:01:33.540> Alonso<00:01:34.229> through<00:01:35.130> the<00:01:35.250> pit

will Hamilton and Alonso through the pit

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.520 
will Hamilton and Alonso through the pit
stops<00:01:35.759> that<00:01:36.090> happened<00:01:36.540> was<00:01:36.840> the<00:01:37.049> safety<00:01:37.259> car

stops that happened was the safety car

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.890 
stops that happened was the safety car
just<00:01:38.220> a<00:01:38.340> bit<00:01:38.460> afterwards<00:01:38.939> that<00:01:39.360> happened<00:01:39.659> with

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
but Hamilton i would say didn't even

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:19.250 
but Hamilton i would say didn't even
quite<00:02:16.980> enough<00:02:17.280> space<00:02:17.640> I<00:02:17.970> mean<00:02:18.450> Hamilton<00:02:19.050> you

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
quite enough space I mean Hamilton you

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:20.900 
quite enough space I mean Hamilton you
could<00:02:19.440> have<00:02:19.530> got<00:02:19.710> fourth<00:02:20.010> place<00:02:20.130> in<00:02:20.550> this<00:02:20.640> race

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520 
but you came you know you finish out the

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.850 
but you came you know you finish out the
points<00:02:23.910> and<00:02:24.030> you<00:02:24.600> didn't<00:02:24.840> gain<00:02:24.930> any<00:02:25.140> ground<00:02:25.260> on

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:39.740

he<00:02:37.980> lost<00:02:38.130> this<00:02:38.400> position<00:02:38.880> because<00:02:39.000> I<00:02:39.210> really

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
he lost this position because I really

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:41.600 
he lost this position because I really
you<00:02:40.110> know<00:02:40.140> it's<00:02:40.560> nice<00:02:40.710> to<00:02:40.920> see<00:02:41.040> every<00:02:41.280> driver

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
you know it's nice to see every driver

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:43.430 
you know it's nice to see every driver
up<00:02:41.790> there<00:02:42.090> as<00:02:42.270> buttons<00:02:42.900> not<00:02:43.050> doing<00:02:43.290> too<00:02:43.410> well

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
up there as buttons not doing too well

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:46.580 
up there as buttons not doing too well
but<00:02:44.130> I'm<00:02:44.610> a<00:02:44.670> Maldonado<00:02:45.000> fan<00:02:45.660> and<00:02:46.020> I<00:02:46.260> realized

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
but I'm a Maldonado fan and I realized

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:48.440 
but I'm a Maldonado fan and I realized
he<00:02:46.740> went<00:02:46.890> all<00:02:47.010> the<00:02:47.100> way<00:02:47.130> off<00:02:47.310> the<00:02:47.490> track<00:02:47.790> but

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
he went all the way off the track but

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.270 
he went all the way off the track but
really<00:02:49.050> Maldonado<00:02:49.500> had<00:02:49.740> the<00:02:49.860> pace<00:02:50.070> he

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
really Maldonado had the pace he

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:51.230 
really Maldonado had the pace he
probably<00:02:50.459> might<00:02:50.700> have<00:02:50.790> got<00:02:50.940> him<00:02:51.000> into<00:02:51.180> the

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:51.240 
probably might have got him into the

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:53.240 
probably might have got him into the
natick<00:02:51.510> corner<00:02:51.840> so<00:02:51.990> if<00:02:52.230> you<00:02:52.740> know<00:02:52.830> Hamilton

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
natick corner so if you know Hamilton

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:55.400 
natick corner so if you know Hamilton
really<00:02:53.459> should<00:02:53.580> just<00:02:53.730> gave<00:02:53.970> it<00:02:54.120> up<00:02:54.260> but<00:02:55.260> this

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410 
really should just gave it up but this

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:57.680 
really should just gave it up but this
meant<00:02:55.709> that<00:02:55.880> Maldonado<00:02:56.880> lost<00:02:57.150> his<00:02:57.300> front<00:02:57.540> wing

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 
meant that Maldonado lost his front wing

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:59.840 
meant that Maldonado lost his front wing
and<00:02:57.990> finished<00:02:58.380> 10th<00:02:58.650> but<00:02:59.100> Michael<00:02:59.520> Schumer

00:02:59.840 --> 00:02:59.850 
and finished 10th but Michael Schumer

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:01.310 
and finished 10th but Michael Schumer
are<00:03:00.000> up<00:03:00.120> to<00:03:00.240> third<00:03:00.450> position<00:03:00.660> which<00:03:01.110> was

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:01.320 
are up to third position which was

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:04.130

amazing<00:03:01.680> we<00:03:02.340> wanted<00:03:02.790> to<00:03:02.970> see<00:03:03.150> this<00:03:03.360> he<00:03:03.840> didn't

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 
amazing we wanted to see this he didn't

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:05.510 
amazing we wanted to see this he didn't
think<00:03:04.260> he<00:03:04.350> was<00:03:04.530> going<00:03:04.709> to<00:03:04.770> win<00:03:04.980> he<00:03:05.250> thought<00:03:05.459> it

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:05.520 
think he was going to win he thought it

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:07.040 
think he was going to win he thought it

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:07.050 
was going to be a tough race for him but

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:10.130 
was going to be a tough race for him but
he<00:03:07.110> came<00:03:07.410> all<00:03:07.650> the<00:03:07.890> way<00:03:07.920> back<00:03:08.040> and<00:03:08.610> got<00:03:09.540> a<00:03:09.780> third

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140 
he came all the way back and got a third

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:12.770 
he came all the way back and got a third
position<00:03:10.680> I'm<00:03:10.890> just<00:03:11.459> so<00:03:11.640> happy<00:03:11.820> that<00:03:12.180> this

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
position I'm just so happy that this

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:14.780

happened<00:03:13.200> it<00:03:13.290> was<00:03:13.410> an<00:03:13.500> exciting<00:03:13.920> race<00:03:14.370> one<00:03:14.670> of

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790 
happened it was an exciting race one of

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:16.430 
happened it was an exciting race one of
the<00:03:14.880> best<00:03:15.090> Valencian<00:03:15.750> Grand<00:03:16.050> Prix's<00:03:16.260> I've

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 
the best Valencian Grand Prix's I've

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:17.930 
the best Valencian Grand Prix's I've
ever<00:03:16.590> seen<00:03:16.800> or<00:03:16.980> the<00:03:17.010> European<00:03:17.430> Grand<00:03:17.610> Prix's
