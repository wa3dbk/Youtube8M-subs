00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
will depend on how your hair feels if

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.950 
will depend on how your hair feels if
your<00:01:20.189> hair<00:01:20.400> leans<00:01:20.700> more<00:01:20.820> on<00:01:21.150> feeling<00:01:21.570> like

it's<00:01:22.259> more<00:01:22.680> of<00:01:22.799> a<00:01:22.890> silky<00:01:23.340> grade<00:01:23.580> then<00:01:24.090> I

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
it's more of a silky grade then I

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.450 
it's more of a silky grade then I
suggest<00:01:24.450> that<00:01:24.780> you<00:01:24.930> use<00:01:24.960> toyokalon<00:01:25.860> here<00:01:26.310> to

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
suggest that you use toyokalon here to

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.280 
suggest that you use toyokalon here to
do<00:01:26.580> your<00:01:26.729> braids<00:01:27.000> a<00:01:27.119> twist<00:01:27.420> but<00:01:27.990> if<00:01:28.170> the

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
do your braids a twist but if the

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.050 
do your braids a twist but if the
texture<00:01:28.619> of<00:01:28.710> your<00:01:28.799> hair<00:01:28.950> feels<00:01:29.430> more<00:01:29.700> of<00:01:29.759> a

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
texture of your hair feels more of a

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.420 
texture of your hair feels more of a
kinkier<00:01:30.600> or<00:01:30.900> more<00:01:31.140> of<00:01:31.200> a<00:01:31.290> coarser<00:01:31.860> feel<00:01:32.159> to

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430

your<00:01:32.579> hair<00:01:32.820> then<00:01:33.240> I<00:01:33.360> suggest<00:01:33.570> that<00:01:33.810> you<00:01:34.020> use

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
your hair then I suggest that you use

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:35.840 
your hair then I suggest that you use
kanekalon<00:01:34.979> braiding<00:01:35.009> hair<00:01:35.430> to<00:01:35.610> do<00:01:35.729> your
