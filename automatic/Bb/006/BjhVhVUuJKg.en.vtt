00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:07.390
 situations I will explain to you what they are for 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:10.790

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:29.990
 we just downloaded good these six 

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:31.369
 speeches are speeches bloggers per se 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:33.590
 you want to leave the blog 

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:35.930
 it encourages you a lot to come back later 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:38.600
 from the gatillazo speech to go to the gym 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:41.240

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:42.920

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.690
 Well the truth is that every speech is 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:49.820
 a world motivates a lot because the uncle 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:52.790
 who says he has a voice the truth is 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:54.830
 that gives you encouragement and it has worked for me 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:56.600
 a lot and that's why I recommend it to you 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:58.850
 I've been here I recommend it well 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:01.729
 was based on an application that was 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:03.770
 for the iphones that is called 

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:05.869
 Motivator but I moved to 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:07.760
 android to offer you the because 

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:09.830
 it was the best application of motivation 

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:11.270
 that there was so far but not the 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:13.310
 we had for android then the only thing 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:14.810
 what we have to do is put those 6 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:16.730
 music files in a list of 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:18.980
 reproduction and we can already put a 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:21.410
 shortcut here on the desktop and 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:24.200
 we already have those for different occasions 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:26.239
 to motivate us well because this has been 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:28.489
 I hope you liked it and if you have 

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:30.320
 been so do not hesitate to give a like 

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:34.300
