00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:13.300 

so<00:00:11.750> it<00:00:11.960> fits<00:00:12.200> in<00:00:12.380> your<00:00:12.410> machine<00:00:12.710> just<00:00:13.100> like<00:00:13.220> a

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:13.310 
so it fits in your machine just like a

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:16.900 
so it fits in your machine just like a
needle<00:00:14.530> and<00:00:15.530> is<00:00:15.740> compatible<00:00:16.130> with<00:00:16.460> other

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:16.910 
needle and is compatible with other

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:20.070 
needle and is compatible with other
machines<00:00:17.420> not<00:00:17.630> just<00:00:17.869> running<00:00:18.290> oh<00:00:18.680> really<00:00:19.040> oh

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:20.080 
machines not just running oh really oh

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:23.170 
machines not just running oh really oh
so<00:00:21.080> as<00:00:21.320> as<00:00:21.590> the<00:00:22.010> tool<00:00:22.220> is<00:00:22.430> working<00:00:22.910> in<00:00:23.029> your

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:23.180 
so as as the tool is working in your

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:25.870 
so as as the tool is working in your
work<00:00:23.330> through<00:00:23.750> your<00:00:23.840> design<00:00:24.290> then<00:00:24.950> you<00:00:25.369> rotate

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:25.880 
work through your design then you rotate

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:27.970 
work through your design then you rotate
the<00:00:26.090> blade<00:00:26.150> to<00:00:26.840> the<00:00:26.960> different<00:00:27.320> position<00:00:27.770> so

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:27.980 
the blade to the different position so

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:30.100 
the blade to the different position so
it<00:00:28.099> is<00:00:28.250> all<00:00:28.400> this<00:00:29.119> is<00:00:29.300> only<00:00:29.509> to<00:00:29.689> get<00:00:29.810> a<00:00:29.869> nice

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:30.110 
it is all this is only to get a nice

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:33.880 
it is all this is only to get a nice
clean<00:00:30.349> cut<00:00:31.000> coming<00:00:32.000> so<00:00:32.870> now<00:00:33.020> you've<00:00:33.500> always

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:33.890 
clean cut coming so now you've always

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:39.240 
clean cut coming so now you've always
going<00:00:34.100> to<00:00:34.190> start<00:00:34.460> on<00:00:35.020> on<00:00:36.020> position<00:00:36.950> number<00:00:37.100> one

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:39.250 
going to start on on position number one

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:41.800 
going to start on on position number one
because<00:00:40.250> the<00:00:40.610> machine<00:00:41.000> thinks<00:00:41.210> such<00:00:41.510> thread

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:41.810 
because the machine thinks such thread

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:42.970 
because the machine thinks such thread
in<00:00:41.930> here<00:00:42.140> is<00:00:42.200> can<00:00:42.380> ask<00:00:42.590> me

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:42.980 
in here is can ask me

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:57.010 
in here is can ask me
have<00:00:43.579> his<00:00:43.790> friend

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:57.020 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:58.780 

and<00:00:57.500> it's<00:00:57.710> going<00:00:57.860> to<00:00:57.980> advance<00:00:58.340> through<00:00:58.760> the

00:00:58.780 --> 00:00:58.790 
and it's going to advance through the

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:03.730 
and it's going to advance through the
design<00:00:59.330> on<00:01:00.190> position<00:01:01.190> flight<00:01:01.400> number<00:01:01.760> one<00:01:02.740> and

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:03.740 
design on position flight number one and

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:07.720 
design on position flight number one and
then<00:01:04.070> we'll<00:01:04.100> change<00:01:04.489> it<00:01:04.640> to<00:01:04.820> position<00:01:05.030> two<00:01:06.730> to

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:07.730 
then we'll change it to position two to

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:09.460 
then we'll change it to position two to
see<00:01:07.940> here<00:01:08.210> now<00:01:08.330> is<00:01:08.510> telling<00:01:08.810> me<00:01:08.840> to<00:01:08.930> change<00:01:09.320> it

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:09.470 
see here now is telling me to change it

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:12.280 
see here now is telling me to change it
to<00:01:09.650> cut<00:01:09.860> number<00:01:10.160> 20<00:01:10.450> so<00:01:11.450> I<00:01:11.480> minute<00:01:11.810> is<00:01:11.930> simply

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:12.290 
to cut number 20 so I minute is simply

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:26.820 
to cut number 20 so I minute is simply
reaching<00:01:12.500> here<00:01:12.830> in<00:01:12.920> rotating<00:01:13.990> to<00:01:14.990> number<00:01:15.260> two

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:26.830 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:28.470 

so<00:01:27.310> now<00:01:27.430> it's<00:01:27.610> telling<00:01:27.850> me<00:01:27.880> to<00:01:28.060> go<00:01:28.210> to<00:01:28.360> number

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:28.480 
so now it's telling me to go to number

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:33.630 
so now it's telling me to go to number
three

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:33.640 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:37.630 

you<00:01:34.640> can<00:01:34.880> hoop<00:01:35.150> up<00:01:35.360> to<00:01:35.540> eight<00:01:35.720> layers<00:01:36.370> and<00:01:37.370> cut

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:37.640 
you can hoop up to eight layers and cut

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:40.780 
you can hoop up to eight layers and cut
through<00:01:37.910> all<00:01:38.090> the<00:01:38.120> layers<00:01:38.860> yeah<00:01:39.860> so<00:01:40.490> a<00:01:40.520> lot<00:01:40.760> of

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:40.790 
through all the layers yeah so a lot of

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:44.160 
through all the layers yeah so a lot of
people<00:01:41.180> that<00:01:41.300> are<00:01:41.450> doing<00:01:41.480> the<00:01:42.020> Rose<00:01:42.860> of<00:01:43.040> Sharon

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:44.170 
people that are doing the Rose of Sharon

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:46.600 
people that are doing the Rose of Sharon
because<00:01:45.170> most<00:01:45.590> of<00:01:45.740> all<00:01:45.890> the<00:01:46.040> leaves<00:01:46.250> are<00:01:46.490> the

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:46.610 
because most of all the leaves are the

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:53.230 
because most of all the leaves are the
same<00:01:46.850> size<00:01:48.910> then<00:01:49.910> you<00:01:50.030> get<00:01:50.180> multiple<00:01:51.070> yet<00:01:52.240> and

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:53.240 
same size then you get multiple yet and

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:55.240 
same size then you get multiple yet and
I<00:01:53.420> believe<00:01:53.780> some<00:01:53.990> of<00:01:54.020> the<00:01:54.140> flower<00:01:54.500> petals<00:01:55.040> and

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:55.250 
I believe some of the flower petals and

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:58.000 
I believe some of the flower petals and
flowers<00:01:56.180> are<00:01:56.390> allowing<00:01:56.900> the<00:01:57.050> same

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:58.010 
flowers are allowing the same

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:00.780 
flowers are allowing the same
yes<00:01:58.220> same<00:01:59.030> size<00:01:59.300> so<00:01:59.540> that<00:01:59.570> we<00:01:59.900> can

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:00.790 
yes same size so that we can

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:02.840 
yes same size so that we can
that's<00:02:01.390> convenient<00:02:01.780> yeah

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
that's convenient yeah

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.120 
that's convenient yeah
the<00:02:03.360> cut<00:02:03.570> work<00:02:03.780> tool<00:02:04.020> also<00:02:04.290> does<00:02:04.680> the<00:02:04.710> more

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
the cut work tool also does the more

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.389 
the cut work tool also does the more
traditional<00:02:05.280> attempt<00:02:05.909> at<00:02:06.119> work<00:02:07.039> and<00:02:08.039> it<00:02:08.250> does

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
traditional attempt at work and it does

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:11.800 
traditional attempt at work and it does
all<00:02:08.550> the<00:02:08.729> stitching<00:02:09.179> as<00:02:09.300> well

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:11.810 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:14.080 

and<00:02:12.380> in<00:02:12.560> the<00:02:12.709> software<00:02:13.130> in<00:02:13.520> the<00:02:13.760> software

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
and in the software in the software

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:16.390 
and in the software in the software
program<00:02:14.510> there<00:02:14.690> are<00:02:14.840> many<00:02:15.170> designs<00:02:15.650> already

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.400 
program there are many designs already

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.670 
program there are many designs already
programmed<00:02:17.030> in<00:02:17.209> that<00:02:17.360> runs<00:02:17.720> you<00:02:18.020> can<00:02:18.230> import

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 
programmed in that runs you can import

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:20.350 
programmed in that runs you can import
embroidery<00:02:19.310> designs<00:02:19.700> and<00:02:19.940> turn<00:02:20.090> them<00:02:20.209> into

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:20.360 
embroidery designs and turn them into

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:22.360 
embroidery designs and turn them into
some<00:02:20.599> work<00:02:20.780> oh<00:02:20.959> really<00:02:21.319> oh<00:02:21.349> you<00:02:21.590> can<00:02:21.830> you<00:02:22.160> can

designs and you can modify them and
change<00:02:28.160> them<00:02:28.310> around<00:02:28.870> it's<00:02:29.870> a<00:02:30.050> lot<00:02:30.230> of

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:30.590 
change them around it's a lot of

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:32.830 
change them around it's a lot of
creative<00:02:30.920> possibilities<00:02:31.370> now<00:02:32.360> that<00:02:32.540> the

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:32.840 
creative possibilities now that the

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.500 
creative possibilities now that the
apron<00:02:33.230> pattern<00:02:33.620> is<00:02:33.830> part<00:02:34.160> of<00:02:34.250> the<00:02:34.370> design<00:02:34.550> in

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:35.510 
apron pattern is part of the design in

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:37.600 
apron pattern is part of the design in
the<00:02:35.569> cut<00:02:35.870> work<00:02:36.050> tool<00:02:36.290> however<00:02:36.920> I<00:02:36.950> did<00:02:37.310> modify

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:37.610 
the cut work tool however I did modify

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:39.910 
the cut work tool however I did modify
it<00:02:37.819> slightly<00:02:38.060> sure<00:02:38.690> there's<00:02:39.560> a<00:02:39.650> lot<00:02:39.890> of

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:39.920 
it slightly sure there's a lot of

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:42.040 
it slightly sure there's a lot of
details<00:02:40.459> that<00:02:40.550> are<00:02:40.849> on<00:02:41.000> the<00:02:41.150> flowers<00:02:41.569> and<00:02:41.900> I

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:42.050 
details that are on the flowers and I

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:43.870 
details that are on the flowers and I
left<00:02:42.260> that<00:02:42.440> out<00:02:42.500> because<00:02:42.769> I<00:02:43.010> wanted<00:02:43.280> to<00:02:43.340> show

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:43.880 
left that out because I wanted to show

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:46.120 
left that out because I wanted to show
the<00:02:44.480> applique<00:02:44.989> and<00:02:45.170> not<00:02:45.350> so<00:02:45.620> much<00:02:45.680> have<00:02:46.010> the

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:56.490 
if you were ready to place this a play

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:58.520 
if you were ready to place this a play
on<00:02:56.670> a<00:02:56.700> garment<00:02:57.420> or<00:02:57.630> both<00:02:57.930> or<00:02:57.960> whatever<00:02:58.410> you

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
on a garment or both or whatever you

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:59.990 
on a garment or both or whatever you
wanted<00:02:58.770> to<00:02:58.830> do<00:02:59.070> then<00:02:59.280> there's<00:02:59.460> a<00:02:59.550> separate

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
wanted to do then there's a separate

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.940 
wanted to do then there's a separate
file<00:03:00.210> that<00:03:00.480> you<00:03:00.630> would

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
file that you would

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:04.729 
file that you would
that<00:03:02.550> has<00:03:02.760> all<00:03:02.940> the<00:03:03.120> stitches<00:03:03.540> and<00:03:04.470> it<00:03:04.590> would

00:03:04.729 --> 00:03:04.739 
that has all the stitches and it would

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:07.699 
that has all the stitches and it would
have<00:03:04.950> a<00:03:04.980> placement<00:03:05.550> stitch<00:03:05.910> first<00:03:06.660> so<00:03:07.650> you

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:07.709 
have a placement stitch first so you

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:10.280 
have a placement stitch first so you
would<00:03:08.099> know<00:03:08.250> which<00:03:08.629> angle<00:03:09.629> to<00:03:09.660> place<00:03:10.080> your

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 
would know which angle to place your

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:12.920 
would know which angle to place your
application<00:03:11.099> and<00:03:11.640> then<00:03:11.819> it's<00:03:12.030> going<00:03:12.239> to

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930 
application and then it's going to

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:15.530 
application and then it's going to
blanket<00:03:13.739> stitch<00:03:14.040> or<00:03:14.310> satin<00:03:14.849> stitch<00:03:15.150> and

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540 
blanket stitch or satin stitch and

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:19.960 
blanket stitch or satin stitch and
whatever<00:03:15.900> you
