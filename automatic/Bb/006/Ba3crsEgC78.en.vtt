00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
Kiwi grip type product that was on there

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.410 
Kiwi grip type product that was on there
I<00:01:16.680> don't<00:01:16.890> think<00:01:17.490> it<00:01:17.549> was<00:01:17.640> Kiwi<00:01:17.939> grip<00:01:18.119> but<00:01:18.270> it's

very<00:01:18.689> very<00:01:18.960> similar<00:01:19.939> so<00:01:20.939> we<00:01:21.060> sand<00:01:21.270> off<00:01:21.420> the

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
very very similar so we sand off the

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.630 
very very similar so we sand off the
peaks<00:01:21.840> so<00:01:22.140> that<00:01:22.320> the<00:01:22.590> Kiwi<00:01:22.860> grip<00:01:23.040> can<00:01:23.250> actually

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
peaks so that the Kiwi grip can actually

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.249 
peaks so that the Kiwi grip can actually
get<00:01:23.759> its<00:01:23.909> own<00:01:24.030> peaks<00:01:24.479> and<00:01:24.810> then<00:01:24.900> once<00:01:25.110> I<00:01:25.200> do

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
get its own peaks and then once I do

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:26.810 
get its own peaks and then once I do
that<00:01:25.380> I<00:01:25.560> go<00:01:25.830> ahead<00:01:25.950> and<00:01:26.130> wash<00:01:26.280> it<00:01:26.490> off<00:01:26.610> really

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
that I go ahead and wash it off really

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.630 
that I go ahead and wash it off really
good<00:01:26.970> and<00:01:27.450> then<00:01:28.110> use<00:01:28.290> a<00:01:28.320> towel<00:01:28.680> to<00:01:28.890> dry<00:01:29.400> it<00:01:29.460> so

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
good and then use a towel to dry it so

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.460 
good and then use a towel to dry it so
that<00:01:30.000> it<00:01:30.090> helps<00:01:30.240> dry<00:01:31.110> a<00:01:31.140> lot<00:01:31.380> quicker<00:01:32.720> if<00:01:33.720> by

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
that it helps dry a lot quicker if by

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.200 
that it helps dry a lot quicker if by
any<00:01:34.590> chance<00:01:34.710> you<00:01:35.189> notice<00:01:35.549> that<00:01:35.850> you<00:01:36.180> have

water beating up anywhere after you wash
it<00:01:38.790> off<00:01:38.939> it<00:01:39.299> means<00:01:40.259> that<00:01:40.439> you've<00:01:40.590> got<00:01:40.619> an<00:01:40.829> oil

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
something like that and Kiwi grip is

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.190 
something like that and Kiwi grip is
going<00:01:44.909> to<00:01:44.970> have<00:01:45.060> a<00:01:45.090> hard<00:01:45.360> time<00:01:45.540> gripping<00:01:45.780> to<00:01:46.110> it

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200

clean<00:01:54.390> it<00:01:54.540> well<00:01:55.070> then<00:01:56.070> go<00:01:56.310> ahead<00:01:56.369> and<00:01:56.579> spray<00:01:57.000> it

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149

clean it well then go ahead and spray it
off<00:01:57.270> again<00:01:57.659> and<00:01:57.899> it's<00:01:58.770> good<00:01:59.159> to<00:01:59.399> use<00:01:59.640> a

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
off again and it's good to use a

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.789 
off again and it's good to use a
pressure<00:02:00.299> washer<00:02:00.869> if<00:02:01.020> you<00:02:01.170> can<00:02:01.439> to<00:02:01.770> really

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
pressure washer if you can to really

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:03.180 
pressure washer if you can to really
clean<00:02:02.700> it

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:03.190 
clean it

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:07.770 
clean it
before<00:02:04.350> your<00:02:05.350> final<00:02:05.560> prep<00:02:06.480> next<00:02:07.480> thing<00:02:07.630> I<00:02:07.720> do

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:07.780 
before your final prep next thing I do

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:10.469 
before your final prep next thing I do
is<00:02:08.080> go<00:02:08.260> ahead<00:02:08.380> and<00:02:08.500> take<00:02:09.070> everything<00:02:09.580> off<00:02:09.940> I

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:10.479 
is go ahead and take everything off I

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:12.390 
is go ahead and take everything off I
can<00:02:11.080> use<00:02:11.260> the<00:02:11.410> lines<00:02:11.620> that<00:02:11.830> are<00:02:11.980> already<00:02:12.010> on

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.400 
can use the lines that are already on

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:16.250 
can use the lines that are already on
here<00:02:12.700> to<00:02:13.950> tape<00:02:14.950> off<00:02:15.190> a<00:02:15.220> little<00:02:15.550> bit<00:02:15.670> easier

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
here to tape off a little bit easier

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.630 
here to tape off a little bit easier
sometimes<00:02:17.260> it's<00:02:17.590> easier<00:02:17.920> if<00:02:18.100> you<00:02:18.220> don't<00:02:18.460> have

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:18.640 
sometimes it's easier if you don't have

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:20.070 
sometimes it's easier if you don't have
the<00:02:18.760> lines<00:02:18.970> because<00:02:19.240> then<00:02:19.420> you<00:02:19.540> can<00:02:19.720> just<00:02:19.750> make

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:20.080 
the lines because then you can just make

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:25.170 
the lines because then you can just make
your<00:02:20.290> own<00:02:20.320> I<00:02:21.000> use<00:02:22.000> a<00:02:22.770> 3m<00:02:23.770> tape<00:02:24.010> it's<00:02:24.550> really

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:27.600 
your own I use a 3m tape it's really
good<00:02:25.360> it's<00:02:25.510> kind<00:02:25.750> of<00:02:25.840> a<00:02:25.960> waterproof<00:02:26.620> texture

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610 
good it's kind of a waterproof texture

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:30.030 
good it's kind of a waterproof texture
on<00:02:27.730> the<00:02:27.820> top<00:02:28.030> of<00:02:28.270> it<00:02:28.420> so<00:02:28.570> if<00:02:28.900> you<00:02:29.590> have<00:02:29.620> to<00:02:29.860> leave

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.040 
on the top of it so if you have to leave

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:31.830 
on the top of it so if you have to leave
it<00:02:30.190> overnight<00:02:30.400> or<00:02:30.850> something<00:02:31.120> like<00:02:31.240> that<00:02:31.510> it's

inside turns is I can go ahead and bend
the<00:02:42.250> tape<00:02:42.460> easily<00:02:43.000> for<00:02:43.210> the<00:02:43.240> inside<00:02:43.630> turns<00:02:44.020> and

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:44.380 
the tape easily for the inside turns and

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:46.980 
the tape easily for the inside turns and
and<00:02:44.650> make<00:02:45.190> them<00:02:45.430> a<00:02:45.460> little<00:02:45.640> bit<00:02:45.850> easier<00:02:45.990> for

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:46.990 
and make them a little bit easier for

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:48.630 
and make them a little bit easier for
the<00:02:47.080> outside<00:02:47.470> turns<00:02:47.830> I<00:02:48.010> just<00:02:48.190> put<00:02:48.310> the<00:02:48.400> tape

the outside turns I just put the tape
over<00:02:49.180> the<00:02:49.690> edges<00:02:50.110> and<00:02:50.700> that<00:02:51.700> way<00:02:51.970> I<00:02:52.330> can<00:02:52.510> go

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:53.080 
over the edges and that way I can go

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:56.220 
over the edges and that way I can go
back<00:02:53.320> and<00:02:53.590> use<00:02:54.070> a<00:02:54.100> razor<00:02:54.400> blade<00:02:54.790> and<00:02:55.000> cut<00:02:55.230> the

back and use a razor blade and cut the
edges<00:02:56.380> off<00:02:56.740> like<00:02:57.010> right<00:02:57.190> here<00:02:57.430> what<00:02:57.610> I'm<00:02:57.700> going

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:57.850 
edges off like right here what I'm going

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:00.060 
edges off like right here what I'm going
to<00:02:57.880> do<00:02:58.060> is<00:02:58.330> just<00:02:59.020> use<00:02:59.200> a<00:02:59.230> really<00:02:59.590> sharp<00:02:59.800> razor

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:00.070 
to do is just use a really sharp razor

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:03.660 
to do is just use a really sharp razor
blade<00:03:00.430> cut<00:03:01.330> the<00:03:01.510> edges<00:03:01.690> off<00:03:02.340> don't<00:03:03.340> press<00:03:03.640> down

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:03.670

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:05.670 
blade cut the edges off don't press down
too<00:03:04.090> hard<00:03:04.300> because<00:03:04.420> you<00:03:04.540> don't<00:03:04.900> want<00:03:05.170> to<00:03:05.380> cut

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:05.680 
too hard because you don't want to cut

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:09.510 
too hard because you don't want to cut
into<00:03:05.980> your<00:03:06.970> gel<00:03:07.300> coat<00:03:07.600> or<00:03:08.350> anything<00:03:08.950> else<00:03:09.400> that

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:12.250 
you might be cutting with the turn then

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:14.100 
you might be cutting with the turn then
just<00:03:12.520> slide<00:03:12.760> the<00:03:12.970> edge<00:03:13.120> of<00:03:13.360> the<00:03:13.420> razor<00:03:13.660> right

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:14.110 
just slide the edge of the razor right

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:16.440 
just slide the edge of the razor right
under<00:03:14.560> the<00:03:14.680> tape<00:03:14.890> and<00:03:15.160> then<00:03:15.880> pull<00:03:16.120> it<00:03:16.239> right<00:03:16.390> up

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:16.450 
under the tape and then pull it right up

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:20.040 
under the tape and then pull it right up
and<00:03:16.840> now<00:03:17.620> you've<00:03:17.830> got<00:03:18.010> a<00:03:18.070> nice<00:03:18.400> corner<00:03:19.050> I'm

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:20.050 
and now you've got a nice corner I'm

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:21.750 
and now you've got a nice corner I'm
going<00:03:20.200> to<00:03:20.260> use<00:03:20.410> this<00:03:20.650> technique<00:03:21.400> throughout

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:21.760 
going to use this technique throughout

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:23.310 
going to use this technique throughout
the<00:03:21.940> whole<00:03:22.120> boat<00:03:22.360> or<00:03:22.600> the<00:03:22.660> deck<00:03:23.050> whatever

the whole boat or the deck whatever
you're<00:03:23.620> using<00:03:23.650> the<00:03:24.130> Kiwi<00:03:24.430> grip<00:03:24.640> on<00:03:24.850> the<00:03:25.540> best

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:25.690 
you're using the Kiwi grip on the best

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:27.270 
you're using the Kiwi grip on the best
thing<00:03:25.840> to<00:03:25.870> do<00:03:26.050> is<00:03:26.230> pull<00:03:26.560> anything<00:03:26.830> off<00:03:27.100> the

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:27.280 
thing to do is pull anything off the

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:29.250 
thing to do is pull anything off the
deck<00:03:27.550> that<00:03:27.820> you<00:03:27.850> don't<00:03:28.270> mind<00:03:28.510> reading<00:03:29.170> and

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:29.260 
deck that you don't mind reading and

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:33.050 
deck that you don't mind reading and
you'll<00:03:30.250> get<00:03:30.400> the<00:03:30.550> best<00:03:31.080> result<00:03:32.080> that<00:03:32.140> way

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060 
you'll get the best result that way

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:35.310 
you'll get the best result that way
before<00:03:34.060> you<00:03:34.150> start<00:03:34.390> the<00:03:34.510> application<00:03:34.630> make

this<00:04:29.040> one<00:04:29.280> because<00:04:29.490> there's<00:04:30.450> always<00:04:30.720> a<00:04:30.840> Kiwi

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:31.230 
this one because there's always a Kiwi

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:33.710 
this one because there's always a Kiwi
already<00:04:31.740> a<00:04:31.830> Kiwi<00:04:32.370> grip<00:04:32.580> like<00:04:32.790> product<00:04:33.270> on<00:04:33.450> here

so<00:04:33.930> I<00:04:33.960> have<00:04:34.230> to<00:04:34.260> use<00:04:34.560> it<00:04:34.590> very<00:04:35.190> similar<00:04:35.640> just

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:35.880 
so I have to use it very similar just

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:37.970 
so I have to use it very similar just
like<00:04:36.090> a<00:04:36.120> regular<00:04:36.570> roller<00:04:36.810> and<00:04:37.170> paint<00:04:37.680> right

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:37.980 
like a regular roller and paint right

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:40.600 
like a regular roller and paint right
just<00:04:38.730> put<00:04:38.880> it<00:04:38.940> in<00:04:39.000> a<00:04:39.060> pan<00:04:39.330> or<00:04:39.360> roll<00:04:39.810> it<00:04:39.960> on<00:04:40.110> there

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:40.610 
just put it in a pan or roll it on there

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:43.750 
just put it in a pan or roll it on there
because<00:04:41.610> the<00:04:41.880> trout<00:04:42.270> doesn't<00:04:42.630> work<00:04:42.750> very<00:04:42.780> well

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:43.760 
because the trout doesn't work very well

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:46.790

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:50.670 
away because Kiwi grip does dry very

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:52.820 
away because Kiwi grip does dry very
quickly<00:04:50.790> and<00:04:51.420> if<00:04:52.020> you<00:04:52.140> don't<00:04:52.380> pull<00:04:52.560> it<00:04:52.590> off
