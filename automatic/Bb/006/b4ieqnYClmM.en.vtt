Namaskar
Welcome to nishamadhulika.com

00:00:06.125 --> 00:00:08.435
Today we will make Badaam(almond) ka Halwa

00:00:08.794 --> 00:00:19.128
almonds are high on protein, fiber, calcium, potassium, magnesium and vitamin E.

00:00:19.424 --> 00:00:21.821
Almond is also anti oxidant in nature.

00:00:22.443 --> 00:00:28.367
If 5-6 almonds are eaten in a day then it acts as a tonic.

00:00:28.887 --> 00:00:32.474
Badam ka Halwa can be given to your uncle.

00:00:32.644 --> 00:00:34.470
Almond give a lot of strength to the body.

00:00:38.602 --> 00:00:40.538
Ingredients required:

00:00:40.956 --> 00:00:45.884
Almonds (soaked in water fro 5-6 hours) - 1 cup

00:00:46.365 --> 00:00:47.667
Sugar - 1 cup

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.201
Elaichi(cardamom) - 3 to 4

00:00:50.545 --> 00:00:52.584
Ghee - a bit more than 1/2 cup

00:00:52.975 --> 00:00:54.261
Milk - 1 cup

00:00:57.043 --> 00:01:03.256
First peel the almonds, which will be easy as they have been soaked in water.

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:16.985
If almonds are not soaked in water for 5-6 hours then you can

00:01:17.011 --> 00:01:22.555
also boil them in water for 5-6 minutes and make peeling easy.

00:01:29.768 --> 00:01:39.341
It takes almost 20 minutes to peel 1 cup almonds, if children help in then it takes just 7-8 minutes.

00:01:42.147 --> 00:01:47.357
Put the almonds and milk together in a mixer to make a coarse paste.

00:02:02.462 --> 00:02:03.931
Heat the frying pan

00:02:04.376 --> 00:02:09.777
a non-stick would be better as almonds tends to stick to the pan while frying.

00:02:10.439 --> 00:02:26.922
Pour 1 spoon Ghee in the pan followed by the almond paste. Now add sugar.

00:02:32.208 --> 00:02:39.102
Stir fry almond paste till it turns light brown.

00:02:39.453 --> 00:02:41.763
You can also put saffron(kesar) to the halwa.

00:02:42.218 --> 00:02:57.016
To put saffron first dissolve it in hot milk then put in the pan when almond paste turns light brown and fry.

00:02:58.139 --> 00:03:09.578
You can also put colour to the halwa. 1 pinch of the yellow darkens the halwa's colour.

00:03:10.112 --> 00:03:14.601
Halwa is delicious and looks good even without saffron or colour.

00:03:16.675 --> 00:03:24.483
Badaam Halwa has to be stir fried continuously to prevent it from sticking to the bottom of the pan.

00:03:24.953 --> 00:03:33.958
Cook on a medium flame. Now add 1 more spoon Ghee to the Halwa.

00:03:37.975 --> 00:03:43.368
The Halwa seems to have fried, now add the saffron.

00:03:43.616 --> 00:03:50.534
Take 20-25 saffron threads and dissolve in hot milk.

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:07.188
A nice loking colour will appear after 5-6 minutes in the milk then we will put it in the Halwa.

00:04:11.503 --> 00:04:18.587
Pour the saffron milk in the Halwa mix and stir fry.

00:04:22.252 --> 00:04:30.663
The almond paste seems to have sufficiently fried and now we will pour the remaining Ghee in it.

00:04:32.184 --> 00:04:36.798
Ghee is put a little at a time to make the Halwa appear greasy.

00:04:37.363 --> 00:04:39.958
Put the Elaichi powder and mix well.

00:04:44.696 --> 00:04:45.950
Turn off the gas.

00:04:49.496 --> 00:05:01.681
Pour Badaam ka Halwa in a bowl and garnish with almonds (the ones we had kept aside) cut into thin, long strips.

00:05:05.425 --> 00:05:07.354
Badaam ka Halwa is ready.

00:05:11.519 --> 00:05:16.162
While preparing Badaam ka Halwa remember to stir fry continuously.

00:05:16.334 --> 00:05:18.333
Do not cook on a high flame

00:05:18.542 --> 00:05:26.142
even if a little almond paste sticks to the pan's base then the Halwa will not taste good.

00:05:26.598 --> 00:05:32.830
If you want Badaam ka Halwa to be more dark then add colour(mixed

00:05:32.856 --> 00:05:39.181
with milk) to it as saffron does not have much influence on colour.

00:05:39.564 --> 00:05:45.895
