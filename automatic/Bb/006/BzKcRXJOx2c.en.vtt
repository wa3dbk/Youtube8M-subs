 Hi everyone, here I am with the video in 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.929
 collaboration with daniela if not the 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:20.220
 you know he has it and he is called like them 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:22.800
 I draw and put his channel here 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:25.109
 youtube where you can click to go 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.670
 to see his proposal obviously 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:29.250
 we have decided to do one together 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.869
 project course on native and I 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.480
 I'll show you how to make a tree of 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:35.160
 Christmas immediately make you list the 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:39.210
 material for our project there 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:42.750
 We must be a plastic tray of 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:45.180
 glue vinavil a paper cone 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:49.260
 made precisely with newspapers a 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:51.780
 which I cut the base is coated with 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.960
 of adhesive tape and cotton in 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.160
 this case is green 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:01:00.770
 start immediately by pouring into the 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.770
 my container on site at the villa mine 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:19.619
 then I add a little bit of water and 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:20.960
 around when he had a compound 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:26.630
 homogeneous 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:26.630
 insert the cotton roll 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:43.400
 which must therefore get wet with the 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:46.310
 compound we made of water and 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:48.320
 With vinavil we must at this point 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:53.380
 get our hands dirty then take it 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:56.960
 our cone our glue and cotton 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:59.360
 and we are going to cover the whole 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:12.220
 cone surface starting from 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:12.220
 tip I'm going to cover everything 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:33.690
 over and over again once coated 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:36.600
 we leave the whole cone to dry 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:39.350
 minimum if hours near a heat source 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:43.080
 after which we verify that it is well 

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:44.520
 stiff and so does the glue has dried 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:48.090
 so now we have to do nothing but 

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:51.270
 just remove the internal structure 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:53.960
 bend slightly inwards e 

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:56.310
 as you can see, it is easily extracted 

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:58.560
 so we have the structure of ours 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:59.640
 tree that we can decorate 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:01.710
 our pleasure 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:03.720
 I find it nice to even enter 

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:06.810
 unfortunately, now I am using lights 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:09.960
 I did n't go to virtually decorate it 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:11.760
 with decorations in white and li 

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:12.480
 I will definitely put the picture of the result 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:15.240
 the final 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:18.240
 I remind you to go see the video 

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:20.960
 of daniela as I design and will ask for a 

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:20.960
 next video hello
