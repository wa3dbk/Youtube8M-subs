side<00:00:30.689> of<00:00:30.750> the<00:00:30.810> hill<00:00:30.990> but<00:00:31.590> we<00:00:31.679> can't<00:00:31.920> use<00:00:31.980> that

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
side of the hill but we can't use that

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:33.680 
side of the hill but we can't use that
in<00:00:32.279> the<00:00:32.430> summertime<00:00:32.700> because<00:00:33.090> it<00:00:33.270> gets<00:00:33.540> way

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
in the summertime because it gets way

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.750 
in the summertime because it gets way
too<00:00:33.719> hot<00:00:33.899> and<00:00:34.350> the<00:00:34.829> stuff<00:00:35.070> won't<00:00:35.280> store<00:00:35.520> it

too hot and the stuff won't store it

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.280 
too hot and the stuff won't store it
we'll<00:00:35.850> just<00:00:36.030> sit<00:00:36.149> it<00:00:36.239> in<00:00:36.329> rot<00:00:36.570> so<00:00:36.870> I'll<00:00:37.110> show

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
we'll just sit it in rot so I'll show

we'll just sit it in rot so I'll show
you<00:00:37.320> what<00:00:37.530> we<00:00:37.649> do<00:00:37.770> in<00:00:37.920> our<00:00:37.980> pantry<00:00:38.340> to<00:00:38.489> store

my hands whatever I'm digging because
the<00:00:48.660> soil<00:00:48.899> that<00:00:49.050> I<00:00:49.110> grow<00:00:49.379> the<00:00:49.559> potatoes<00:00:49.920> in<00:00:50.100> is

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
the soil that I grow the potatoes in is

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
really really light and fluffy so I'll

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.670 
really really light and fluffy so I'll
just<00:00:53.010> start<00:00:53.250> I<00:00:53.780> pull<00:00:54.780> up<00:00:54.809> the<00:00:54.989> plant<00:00:55.260> pull<00:00:55.590> it

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680

that and then the ones that are about
this<00:01:26.610> size<00:01:26.670> or<00:01:27.150> so<00:01:27.650> these<00:01:28.650> here<00:01:29.220> we<00:01:29.369> will<00:01:29.520> save

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
this size or so these here we will save

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.700 
this size or so these here we will save
these<00:01:30.000> and<00:01:30.240> dry<00:01:30.390> these<00:01:30.450> out<00:01:30.750> and<00:01:31.049> in<00:01:31.350> next

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
these and dry these out and in next

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.440 
these and dry these out and in next
couple<00:01:31.979> of<00:01:32.130> weeks<00:01:32.189> we<00:01:32.490> will<00:01:32.520> use<00:01:32.790> these<00:01:33.000> as<00:01:33.299> our

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
couple of weeks we will use these as our

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.590 
couple of weeks we will use these as our
seed<00:01:33.689> potatoes<00:01:34.290> to<00:01:35.159> plant<00:01:35.670> the<00:01:36.060> next<00:01:36.270> batch<00:01:36.570> of

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
seed potatoes to plant the next batch of

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.410 
seed potatoes to plant the next batch of

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
potatoes with these are Yukon Golds so

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.270 
potatoes with these are Yukon Golds so
this<00:01:39.900> is<00:01:40.229> when<00:01:40.409> you<00:01:40.500> get<00:01:40.560> a<00:01:40.619> potato<00:01:40.829> about<00:01:41.100> this

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
this is when you get a potato about this

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.370 
this is when you get a potato about this
size<00:01:41.490> or<00:01:41.640> so<00:01:41.820> these<00:01:42.600> will<00:01:42.750> be<00:01:42.780> the<00:01:42.840> ones<00:01:42.960> that<00:01:43.290> I

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
size or so these will be the ones that I

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.700
