and start playing and you can pretty

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.860 
and start playing and you can pretty
much<00:01:09.380> plan<00:01:09.800> anyway<00:01:10.250> you<00:01:10.310> want<00:01:10.729> really<00:01:11.000> just<00:01:11.750> so

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:11.870 
much plan anyway you want really just so

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:14.170 
much plan anyway you want really just so
long<00:01:12.080> as<00:01:12.110> it's<00:01:12.409> enough<00:01:12.710> to<00:01:12.979> send<00:01:13.430> off<00:01:13.729> the

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:14.180 
long as it's enough to send off the

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:17.170 
long as it's enough to send off the
large<00:01:14.869> waves<00:01:15.290> of<00:01:15.590> zombies<00:01:15.619> which<00:01:16.190> isn't<00:01:16.820> too

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:17.180 
large waves of zombies which isn't too

bad<00:01:17.450> in<00:01:17.810> this<00:01:18.369> if<00:01:19.369> you<00:01:19.580> build<00:01:19.909> up<00:01:20.060> your<00:01:20.119> random

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:20.660 
bad in this if you build up your random

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:22.480 
bad in this if you build up your random
stuff<00:01:20.960> like<00:01:21.200> that<00:01:21.229> I<00:01:21.470> mean<00:01:21.740> you<00:01:21.979> get<00:01:22.160> so<00:01:22.340> much

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:22.490

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:24.740 
stuff right away towards the end of this

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:27.370 
stuff right away towards the end of this
level<00:01:25.130> I<00:01:25.220> had<00:01:25.460> it<00:01:25.640> just<00:01:26.060> filled<00:01:26.780> and<00:01:27.080> this<00:01:27.200> is

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:27.380 
level I had it just filled and this is

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:30.190 
level I had it just filled and this is
I'm<00:01:27.590> just<00:01:27.770> putting<00:01:28.070> some<00:01:28.310> cherries<00:01:28.970> so<00:01:29.900> I<00:01:29.930> can

I<00:01:32.780> want<00:01:33.080> to

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:02.480 

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:07.960 

all<00:02:02.960> right<00:02:04.930> now<00:02:05.930> we<00:02:05.990> have<00:02:06.230> all<00:02:06.500> of<00:02:06.890> the<00:02:07.310> lawn

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:07.970

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:09.850 
all right now we have all of the lawn
mowers<00:02:08.240> none<00:02:08.600> now<00:02:08.990> all<00:02:09.170> we<00:02:09.320> need<00:02:09.350> to<00:02:09.500> do<00:02:09.710> is

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:09.860 
mowers none now all we need to do is

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:13.649 
mowers none now all we need to do is
just<00:02:09.890> level

00:02:13.649 --> 00:02:13.659 

00:02:13.659 --> 00:02:15.910 

and<00:02:14.659> this<00:02:14.840> level<00:02:15.140> is<00:02:15.200> really<00:02:15.319> not<00:02:15.530> too<00:02:15.739> bad

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:15.920 
and this level is really not too bad

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:17.850 
and this level is really not too bad
they<00:02:16.069> give<00:02:16.220> you<00:02:16.340> so<00:02:16.519> many<00:02:16.610> cherry<00:02:16.970> bombs<00:02:17.209> that

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:17.860 
they give you so many cherry bombs that

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:23.740 
they give you so many cherry bombs that
you<00:02:18.860> could<00:02:19.010> probably<00:02:19.220> just<00:02:20.090> cherry<00:02:22.420> well<00:02:23.420> not

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:23.750 
you could probably just cherry well not

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:52.509 
you could probably just cherry well not
but<00:02:49.120> the<00:02:50.120> vaulters<00:02:50.540> really<00:02:51.220> got<00:02:52.220> me<00:02:52.400> the

00:02:52.509 --> 00:02:52.519 
but the vaulters really got me the

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:58.420 
but the vaulters really got me the
biggest<00:02:52.760> problem<00:02:54.730> if<00:02:56.709> best<00:02:57.709> way<00:02:57.950> to<00:02:58.010> do<00:02:58.190> it<00:02:58.310> is

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:58.430
