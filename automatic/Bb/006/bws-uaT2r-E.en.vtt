00:00:08.889 --> 00:00:15.350
 a happy breastfeeding that can last 

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:17.600
 from 3 in to with pd others consider 

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:19.720
 recommend six months is based on a spal 

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:22.340
 which are healthy and proper nutrition 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:25.609
 let us consider that a woman has under 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:27.800
 11 kg of weight during pregnancy 

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:30.759
 these correspond to a reserve 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:34.910
 natural already present in the body of the 

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:37.460
 patient of 34 kg of fat who fat 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:40.220
 along with the branch water proteins 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:42.860
 I give this essential nutrient for 

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:47.420
 the child from the first hours until 3 o'clock 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:50.330
 4 5 6 months that milk a woman 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:52.730
 on average it produces daily from 500 

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:55.430
 to 800 ml of milk a day this 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:58.450
 it will consist of calcium water 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:01:02.420
 lipid proteins essential fatty acids 

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:06.409
 amino acids vitamins iron a food 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:08.299
 perfect as mother's milk in nature 

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:11.780
 it is chemically unable to 

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:13.280
 therefore reproduce any substance that 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:15.950
 milk can be taken in place 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:17.659
 maternal will never be perfect and 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:20.270
 product like that of the mother 

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:22.760
 let's see what the mother needs in 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:25.160
 this time the energy requirement 

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:28.320
 of calories madonna 

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:30.690
 on average it can be around 250 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.310
 values and then a slice of bread a little 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:34.440
 of hammered and a glass of milk 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.630
 integrations can be a woman 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:39.120
 pregnant and lactating could 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.640
 the production of a new substance is there 

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:45.470
 a big energy expenditure and that 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:49.230
 so people increase to 500 calories 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:52.560
 daily and to create more 

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:54.020
 this food is quiet and serene 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:57.510
 mother must have some precautions 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:59.940
 try to sleep as much as possible drink 

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:02.610
 water because it is made up of 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:05.250
 water take more protein 17 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:07.200
 grams of protein more newspapers 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:09.840
 protein needs in the person 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:12.900
 based on one gram per kg body weight 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:15.780
 real therefore a person of 60 who a 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:18.450
 sixty weight bodyweight 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:20.610
 ideal body will take 60 grams of 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:23.520
 joint proteins in a selection of 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:25.680
 breastfeeding are 17 g 77 grams of 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:27.900
 protein then a second at lunch and 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.950
 noble and high protein dinner 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:31.140
 legibility 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:34.709
 how can they be cooked eggs? 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:37.500
 of white meat also of ham 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:40.110
 of weeks may be the rump of 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:42.630
 turkey of white fish meat 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:46.200
 rich in essential fatty acids that the 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:48.290
 breast milk from early hours of 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:50.120
 first months of the child's life 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:53.220
 brain development is very important 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:55.500
 of the child reduce as much as possible 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:57.630
 coffee and taking all of those 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:00.000
 vegetables like wrinkle the so-called 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:02.959
 crucifers that have a strong odor 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.720
 then the raffa the cabbage the brocco though 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:06.910
 I would like to emphasize 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:10.300
 this is a completely subjective thing 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:13.120
 they are broad lines but they can 

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:14.800
 also be a broad tolerance 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:17.080
 compared to baby compared to vegetables 

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:18.550
 so if you try and you see that at 

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:20.380
 difficulty in taking milk can 

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:24.280
 be given by one of these substances 

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:26.080
 even chilli or chili foods 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:28.300
 with the added recipe is a chili pepper 

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:32.470
 but they advised against onion abuse 

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:36.030
 garlic is certainly considered 

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:39.580
 strongly advises the first patients of 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:42.190
 cut out over these months a 

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:45.820
 good weather for itself to make the movement 

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:46.360
 so as to spend we say the hours 

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:48.730
 daily 

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:51.190
 counting stress by downloading 

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:54.130
 on physical activity and also trying to 

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:55.840
 resume in the following nine months later 

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:58.870
 the nine months of pregnancy the reform 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:01.330
 physical and therefore muscle tone e 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:04.060
 also a more balanced position 

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:06.520
 compared to the nine months in which it was 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:08.590
 however a healthy imbalance 

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:11.340
 breastfeeding therefore provides will be 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:14.200
 proper nutrition a good dialogue 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:15.550
 with the family with her husband so 

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:18.269
 such from a collaboration and 

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:18.269
 to physical activity
