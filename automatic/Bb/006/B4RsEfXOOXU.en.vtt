00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.660 
doubt it so yeah but if that is
something<00:01:30.450> then<00:01:30.930> that's<00:01:31.320> retarded<00:01:31.740> because

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
something then that's retarded because

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.640

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:31.140 
channel would be worse than losing a big
channel<00:02:29.140> because<00:02:29.349> losing<00:02:29.829> a<00:02:30.040> big<00:02:30.190> channel<00:02:30.549> six

channel because losing a big channel six
months<00:02:31.450> you're<00:02:31.599> probably<00:02:31.750> gonna<00:02:31.930> be<00:02:32.079> back<00:02:32.200> to

00:02:32.309 --> 00:02:32.319 
months you're probably gonna be back to

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:34.559 
months you're probably gonna be back to
normal<00:02:32.470> whereas<00:02:33.370> if<00:02:33.579> you<00:02:33.730> lose<00:02:34.239> a<00:02:34.269> small

00:02:34.559 --> 00:02:34.569 
normal whereas if you lose a small

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:36.710 
normal whereas if you lose a small
channel<00:02:34.930> you're<00:02:35.079> basically<00:02:35.530> done<00:02:35.680> like

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
channel you're basically done like

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.630 
channel you're basically done like
restart<00:02:37.720> buddy<00:02:37.959> you<00:02:38.170> know<00:02:38.290> so<00:02:38.680> is<00:02:39.250> it

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:39.640 
restart buddy you know so is it

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:42.509 
restart buddy you know so is it
necessarily<00:02:40.180> the<00:02:40.780> worst<00:02:41.200> I<00:02:41.680> feel<00:02:42.280> like<00:02:42.370> this

00:02:42.509 --> 00:02:42.519 
necessarily the worst I feel like this

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:43.979 
necessarily the worst I feel like this
will<00:02:42.579> actually<00:02:42.790> probably<00:02:43.000> be<00:02:43.269> better<00:02:43.569> than

00:02:43.979 --> 00:02:43.989 
will actually probably be better than

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:45.599 
will actually probably be better than
the<00:02:44.290> first<00:02:44.440> time<00:02:44.680> he<00:02:44.829> lost<00:02:44.860> his<00:02:45.129> channel<00:02:45.430> I

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:45.609 
the first time he lost his channel I

00:02:45.609 --> 00:02:47.130 
the first time he lost his channel I
should<00:02:46.090> actually<00:02:46.390> the<00:02:46.569> first<00:02:46.720> time<00:02:46.870> was

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:47.140 
should actually the first time was

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:48.900 
should actually the first time was
really<00:02:47.530> good<00:02:47.709> because<00:02:47.859> he<00:02:48.340> had<00:02:48.459> a<00:02:48.489> bunch<00:02:48.730> of

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:48.910 
really good because he had a bunch of

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:51.300 
really good because he had a bunch of
youtubers<00:02:49.090> help<00:02:49.660> him<00:02:49.840> get<00:02:50.530> all<00:02:50.680> his<00:02:50.859> subs<00:02:51.099> back

so sadly that's probably not gonna
happen<00:03:39.040> um<00:03:40.530> but<00:03:41.530> maybe<00:03:42.280> he'll<00:03:42.579> have<00:03:42.730> looked

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:43.000
