00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:19.990 
how to draw a dinosaur so what I'm going

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:57.939 
how to draw a dinosaur so what I'm going
to<00:00:20.019> do<00:00:20.199> is<00:00:20.519> sketch<00:00:21.519> out<00:00:21.759> the<00:00:21.999> rough<00:00:22.179> outline

00:00:57.939 --> 00:00:57.949 

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:00.920 

now<00:00:58.949> what<00:00:59.100> I've<00:00:59.219> done<00:00:59.250> is<00:00:59.879> I've<00:01:00.300> just<00:01:00.719> very

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
now what I've done is I've just very

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.079 
now what I've done is I've just very
lightly<00:01:01.199> planned<00:01:01.649> my<00:01:02.010> drawing<00:01:02.550> which<00:01:02.760> is<00:01:02.910> very

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:03.089 
lightly planned my drawing which is very

00:01:03.089 --> 00:01:05.240 
lightly planned my drawing which is very
important<00:01:03.600> at<00:01:03.660> an<00:01:03.780> early<00:01:04.049> stage<00:01:04.080> because<00:01:04.979> you

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
important at an early stage because you

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.040 
important at an early stage because you
want<00:01:05.430> to<00:01:05.519> get<00:01:05.670> everything<00:01:06.090> right<00:01:06.420> before<00:01:06.930> you

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:07.050 
want to get everything right before you

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:08.810 
want to get everything right before you
make<00:01:07.229> any<00:01:07.259> big<00:01:07.740> decisions<00:01:07.770> and<00:01:08.520> you<00:01:08.610> put

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
make any big decisions and you put

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:14.899 
make any big decisions and you put
anything<00:01:09.350> down<00:01:10.350> in<00:01:11.030> hard<00:01:12.030> pencil<00:01:12.630> so<00:01:13.759> the<00:01:14.759> next

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
anything down in hard pencil so the next

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:16.399 
anything down in hard pencil so the next
thing<00:01:15.060> we're<00:01:15.149> going<00:01:15.240> to<00:01:15.299> do<00:01:15.450> is<00:01:15.690> go<00:01:15.960> over<00:01:16.290> that

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
thing we're going to do is go over that

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:20.389 
thing we're going to do is go over that
line<00:01:16.710> and<00:01:17.070> refine<00:01:18.060> it<00:01:18.270> and<00:01:18.799> put<00:01:19.799> a<00:01:19.830> little<00:01:20.040> stop

00:01:20.389 --> 00:01:20.399 
line and refine it and put a little stop

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:35.330 
line and refine it and put a little stop
putting<00:01:20.700> bits<00:01:20.880> of<00:01:21.030> detail<00:01:21.270> in<00:01:34.130> now<00:01:35.130> you've

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
putting bits of detail in now you've

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.340 
putting bits of detail in now you've
decided<00:01:35.700> on<00:01:36.060> your<00:01:36.119> pencil<00:01:36.479> outline<00:01:36.840> and

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
decided on your pencil outline and

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.100 
decided on your pencil outline and
you've<00:01:37.440> made<00:01:37.619> it<00:01:37.770> a<00:01:37.860> bit<00:01:38.009> thicker<00:01:39.110> start

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
you've made it a bit thicker start

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.080 
you've made it a bit thicker start
thinking<00:01:40.409> about<00:01:40.500> things<00:01:40.890> like<00:01:41.039> where<00:01:41.670> the

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
thinking about things like where the

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:54.730 
thinking about things like where the
lighting<00:01:42.300> is<00:01:42.869> coming<00:01:43.229> from

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:54.740 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:57.800 

so<00:01:55.740> I'm<00:01:55.829> almost<00:01:56.039> there<00:01:56.369> all<00:01:56.789> I<00:01:56.820> need<00:01:57.060> now<00:01:57.240> is<00:01:57.570> to

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
so I'm almost there all I need now is to

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.620 
so I'm almost there all I need now is to
add<00:01:57.960> a<00:01:57.990> little<00:01:58.200> bit<00:01:58.380> of<00:01:58.469> detail<00:01:58.829> to<00:01:58.860> the<00:01:59.630> tail

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
add a little bit of detail to the tail

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:22.640 
add a little bit of detail to the tail
and<00:02:01.280> we're<00:02:02.280> almost<00:02:02.399> there<00:02:02.700> okay

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:25.069 

so<00:02:22.799> there<00:02:23.370> you<00:02:23.459> have<00:02:23.489> your<00:02:23.610> detail<00:02:24.150> one<00:02:24.870> more

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:25.079 
so there you have your detail one more

00:02:25.079 --> 00:02:26.870 
so there you have your detail one more
thing<00:02:25.319> that<00:02:25.349> makes<00:02:25.560> it<00:02:25.860> grounded<00:02:26.459> in<00:02:26.730> the

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
thing that makes it grounded in the

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.089 
thing that makes it grounded in the
picture<00:02:27.269> is<00:02:27.450> to<00:02:27.810> do<00:02:27.959> a<00:02:28.200> shadow<00:02:28.769> underneath

00:02:29.089 --> 00:02:29.099 
picture is to do a shadow underneath

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:31.789 
picture is to do a shadow underneath
because<00:02:29.459> as<00:02:29.880> I<00:02:30.030> said<00:02:30.090> the<00:02:30.420> sun's<00:02:30.690> the<00:02:31.290> light<00:02:31.530> is

00:02:31.789 --> 00:02:31.799 
because as I said the sun's the light is

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:33.920 
because as I said the sun's the light is
coming<00:02:32.099> from<00:02:32.250> above<00:02:32.430> so<00:02:33.299> we<00:02:33.450> need<00:02:33.599> a<00:02:33.630> shadow

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
coming from above so we need a shadow

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:39.710 
coming from above so we need a shadow
underneath<00:02:37.610> once<00:02:38.610> you've<00:02:38.730> done<00:02:38.880> that<00:02:38.940> you

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
underneath once you've done that you

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:43.069 
underneath once you've done that you
should<00:02:39.750> have<00:02:40.200> a<00:02:40.260> ferocious<00:02:42.079> indomitable

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:43.079 
should have a ferocious indomitable

00:02:43.079 --> 00:02:46.040 
should have a ferocious indomitable
