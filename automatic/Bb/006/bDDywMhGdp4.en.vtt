00:00:00.809 --> 00:00:04.259
 this is a monument the rotterdam club with their finest 

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:07.810
 I think something dirty will be secured 

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:10.909
 Landis claims bleeding heavily in the street 

00:00:10.909 --> 00:00:14.279
 but a bit strange that a first set for the baker but that is 

00:00:14.279 --> 00:00:16.929
 of course with a home in the sense of the word 

00:00:16.929 --> 00:00:20.499
 to have it made in a different way on which the toppers stood and one 

00:00:20.499 --> 00:00:21.689
 smaller pieces 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:22.789
 why 

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:27.130
 because it would be feasible for people who have limited time to check 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:30.359
 several children are not talking about this and then it does not work then the 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.030
 to set the clock 

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:34.730
 but when we did have a head start the gap 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:35.980
 in 4 too strong 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:39.000
 who falls a bit that should otherwise find problem that I prostitute 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.530
 concerns 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.530
 so stupid little man we said a game whatever 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.970
 Chairman Peter Storrie 

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:48.880
 cissÃ© come back later and instead of 

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:50.620
 fifteen minutes twenty minutes 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:53.070
 the clock is ready in five to six minutes 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.080
 what are we going to do in the meantime the webber day a van with benno l 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:58.140
 we have 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.740
 together in September 

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:01.820
 a popular uprising 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:03.690
 ts 8 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.080
 why still a little extra extra foreign countries a bit too 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.880
 processing 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:14.710
 8 from now on a little pepper the intention is that the customer what do you need 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:16.200
 then shorten 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.200
 let's qualify and that is very handy to use 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:21.380
 that is thanks to the cda 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:24.409
 it is the netherlands is selling the tickets members 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:26.570
 actually 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:28.380
 respond very well to 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.890
 that you use ham in a kitchen 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:31.990
 he went too far 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:33.080
 very delicious 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:34.610
 and I also have 10 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:38.180
 I am there are members who are excellent or butter and cheese 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:38.950
 cents 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:42.760
 but from the moment you have to start working I have you 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:46.120
 for example, having to come around the clock or make it work on your mind 

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:46.930
 on things like that 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:50.070
 fans that the hand is not so pleasant is the vandals 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:56.310
 Mercedes on the intermediate classification 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.170
 keep it possible 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.399
 the judges are a good team decision 

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:03.609
 it is easy to see from the kitchen that just buy in the store 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:06.880
 the 61 minute silence 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:09.509
 if this is correct it is indeed 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.670
 in loose leaves more or less the idea that your feet come along 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:15.589
 at least in politics the white on the scale 

00:02:15.589 --> 00:02:17.529
 that is cooled a little air 

00:02:17.529 --> 00:02:20.749
 can make thick slices from a past life 

00:02:20.749 --> 00:02:22.599
 how those people no longer do 

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:24.469
 that at schools 

00:02:24.469 --> 00:02:27.049
 you don't know exactly where 

00:02:27.049 --> 00:02:28.669
 that made mojo is spoken 

00:02:28.669 --> 00:02:31.669
 plays a role in 

00:02:39.449 --> 00:02:42.449
 so there is under 

00:02:44.789 --> 00:02:47.939
 they don't do that in the symptoms 

00:02:47.939 --> 00:02:48.939
 such a 

00:02:48.939 --> 00:02:51.939
 that didn't fit 

00:02:53.169 --> 00:02:58.639
 we have our van mln in Wijhe next to that is the biggest opponents to get on 

00:02:58.639 --> 00:03:01.839
 another moment like internet is the statutes of the chip card i have to do 

00:03:01.839 --> 00:03:02.909
 find personally 

00:03:02.909 --> 00:03:05.329
 combination with barely a chance 

00:03:05.329 --> 00:03:08.469
 looking must i hope you miss assembly line 

00:03:08.469 --> 00:03:11.469
 des person we live in a free country kiss 

00:03:12.229 --> 00:03:14.209
 the manager of 

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:17.449
 we also need doctors as a nickname otherwise we have a chance 

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:21.569
 it is a medium and large parts of the country 

00:03:23.729 --> 00:03:26.729
 I can help them those mothers 

00:03:30.649 --> 00:03:33.649
 and the government can do that 

00:03:43.749 --> 00:03:45.369
 like the top class 

00:03:45.369 --> 00:03:48.119
 use it nicely 

00:03:48.119 --> 00:03:49.899
 it's a bit and 

00:03:49.899 --> 00:03:52.709
 cooking on the side that is indeed 

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:56.649
 and I think that in itself is not so nice personal record of the robbers on it 

00:03:56.649 --> 00:03:57.919
 table layers 

00:03:57.919 --> 00:04:00.379
 the record was broken 

00:04:00.379 --> 00:04:05.409
 You can also have a coloring procedures to sell even at that time 

00:04:05.409 --> 00:04:07.760
 ship in abundance
