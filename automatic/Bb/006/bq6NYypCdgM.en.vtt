both<00:05:18.010> pieces<00:05:20.580> hey<00:05:21.580> guys<00:05:21.910> so<00:05:22.420> basically<00:05:22.990> I've

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:23.350 
both pieces hey guys so basically I've

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:27.990 
both pieces hey guys so basically I've
seen<00:05:23.830> the<00:05:24.520> two<00:05:24.760> circles<00:05:25.390> on<00:05:25.890> like<00:05:26.890> this<00:05:27.220> and<00:05:27.580> so

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:28.000 
seen the two circles on like this and so

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.580 
seen the two circles on like this and so
this<00:05:28.180> will<00:05:28.420> just<00:05:28.570> be<00:05:28.690> our<00:05:28.900> base<00:05:29.080> and<00:05:29.380> I<00:05:29.440> guess

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:32.460 
this will just be our base and I guess
this<00:05:29.860> just<00:05:29.890> to<00:05:30.550> hide<00:05:30.820> the<00:05:31.240> stitches<00:05:31.720> but<00:05:32.290> then
