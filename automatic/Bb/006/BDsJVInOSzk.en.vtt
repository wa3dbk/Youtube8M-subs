 quality of our pages and our 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:08.400

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:10.860
 I say that some people my students 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:13.650

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:16.139

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:19.080

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.550
 today there is a lot of choice to do 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.800
 This and some people always 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.320
 Rodrigo asks what I need to do 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.820

 the person he has some tips for today 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:35.640

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:39.719
 some very simple tips that are feel 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:41.820
 the analysis that google loves you helps 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.719
 increasingly google to read your 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.480
 content 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:47.879
 and then the first thing is the rules 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.739
 because he grabbed a player to play 3 and 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.840
 that stands for google 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:54.719
 my page speaks for example about the 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.190
 car and talk about fiat wants to talk 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:57.930
 about utility cars 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.460
 in this google can render 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.920
 better your content 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.690
 the great chip master club he talks about 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.570
 that we need to transform our 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.850
 page and a great billboard because I love 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:11.400
 you hit the eye death pity you no longer 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.560
 There is an invitation, what do you say? 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.060
 the billboard with company propaganda is 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.490
 hasta luego 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:20.400
 and then we as a web surfer we too 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:22.470
 we do a scan on this page 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:25.229
 with that you have that you can get you 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.970
 eliminates the users happens a 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:29.549
 good quality that are not 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.960
 then it is the target audience and qualified its 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:34.380
 users of this page 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:37.049
 basically when you structure the 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:39.150
 Your content will help you and your 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:40.710
 own user that you have the 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.750
 user satisfaction is what the 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:45.600
 google always wants like we always do 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.470
 another very cool point is the 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.409
 images 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.159
 There you half wagner hits such works. 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:52.600
 very well 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:55.090
 google wants the more you 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:55.930
 the better your content qualifies your 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:57.880
 content 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:59.619
 but you get the satisfaction of the 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:03.400
 users so if you can 

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:04.659
 mix the text with images and also 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:07.090
 with videos 

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:09.280
 google goes over the video text and 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:10.030
 pictures google loves about that kind of 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:13.090
 mixture 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:16.209
 He can identify you, I know. 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:18.400
 certain video image text do not speak 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:20.620
 same thing and if you have in your 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.150
 Users will also spend more time in the 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:25.269

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:42.310
 structure capable of competing image rule 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:43.540
