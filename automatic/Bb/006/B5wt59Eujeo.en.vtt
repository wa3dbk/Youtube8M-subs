00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.560
 le pen in the band angels was tim 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:10.380
 the wave of defendants to market the line 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:12.179
 Civic 2015 with very subtle face lift 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.099
 for the lx r version of the sedan 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:15.570
 attempt to regain the leadership of the 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:16.320
 segment that is now occupied by the new 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.910
 Corolla 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.590
 We'll find out here in the 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.600
 elector of the car online these changes 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:24.090
 made the difference for the consumer 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.430
 Good, we are here with Alan. 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:29.010
 first to analyze this face lift of the 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:32.579
 civic who won a new front grille 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:35.969
 a new design of the grid and the wheels of 17 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:38.370
 inches in version lx r in line 2015 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:41.040
 alan, tell me what you think 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.140
 changes of the new good site of 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.180
 The truth is that so the expectation that 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:48.120
 was created for the changes that were 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:50.460
 made left much to be desired know 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:53.460
 starting with the front grille at 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.949
 previous version are now are differences 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:58.199
 and does not understand and does not 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:00.030
 being the wheel is logical now let it be 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.469
 it was awesome 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.899
 the only problem I think the wave 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:06.000
 confusing is the segment that 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:07.470
 She wants to attract, for example, a car. 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.780
 executive line 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:12.390
 the civic now the previous model 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.970
 including a 2008 civic 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.770
 a sports car they did 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.840
 an entire restyling 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.060
 transformation and now with a car in 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.380
 executive line the problem is that by 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.479
 example is concerned with the line of business 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.009
 as the sports wheel can not 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:28.080
 understand what segment they are 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:29.579
 want to hit and out I think it ends 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.250
 confused with a sports outfit 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:34.350
 with executive design this does not 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:37.460
 really for you did not agree no not 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.460
 I would not buy it for myself 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:42.770
 i as drug was commenting 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:44.270
 you 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:47.330
 beyond the 2015 honda civic also 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:49.250
 received some subtleties in the 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:52.759
 also as the chrome finish 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:54.920
 here from the steering wheel buttons for you to 

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:55.970
 directed iv position that these new 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:59.990
 Details 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:05.240
 What do you think? I think it's very beautiful. 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:07.250
 it is easy to handle practical with comfort 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:09.380
 total for who is driving 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:10.940
 the only thing I think is missing a 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:15.080
 multimedia screen 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:17.420
 I found it very nice for the car and in my 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:20.330
 and I would also like the sunroof to 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:21.830
 This line does not lack in this step there 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:24.260
 You, then, for me to be at fault in 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:27.709
 sunscreen and a car is perfect 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:29.299
 very beautiful very easy to demands 

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:33.230
 real 

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:37.269
 the equipment only details in what would be 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:37.269
 a multimedia screen and the sunroof 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:44.329
 Felipe, let's talk a little about the 

00:02:42.049 --> 00:02:47.150
 Finishing was born then what you found 

00:02:44.329 --> 00:02:49.100
 of the materials used here for 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:52.549
 lining the doors, the panel will 

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:56.989
 quality feeling you look at me 

00:02:52.549 --> 00:03:00.980
 I found the visual aspect of the finish 

00:02:56.989 --> 00:03:04.630
 very beautiful is the contrast between color 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:06.170
 dark and light was also very 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:08.510
 pretty 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:11.329
 graphite tone you have on the panel and 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:16.340
 doors also stood out contrasting 

00:03:11.329 --> 00:03:19.000
 with the chrome-plated air vents is unique 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:22.850
 The negative aspect I saw here was the 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:25.220
 the center middle of the car is very 

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:28.760
 facing and positioned for the driver 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:31.220
 if it was more frontal it is and had a 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:32.239
 multimedia kit I think it closed with 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:33.859
 note 10 

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:36.440
 The passenger then you miss the 

00:03:33.859 --> 00:03:38.299
 center is more focused on this 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:41.030
 This is something that she is. 

00:03:38.299 --> 00:03:43.519
 is leaning and if it were straight and 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:44.780
 with a multimedia center closed with 

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:46.120
 Golden Key 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:48.900
 thank you for it 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:48.900
 only 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:55.400
 here he will not talk for a while now 

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:57.830
 who travels here behind the honda civic 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:58.849
 you think the space is comfortable with 

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:01.520
 this vision 

00:03:58.849 --> 00:04:03.230
 I found I like the cinema space that 

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:05.630
 I think it's quite comfortable, I'm a 

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:06.860
 High person my legs give to travel 

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:08.690
 quietly 

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:10.880
 also has the back here that gives 

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:13.430
 Travel more comfortable yet I stayed 

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:14.959
 I'm afraid it 's about the height 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:16.639
 I do not know maybe a person a little more 

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:18.440
 high may be to hit the head but 

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:19.910
 I think it would not be a hindrance to 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:22.300
 person does not buy stop buying the 

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:25.430
 phone off 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:26.870
 Thank you to accelerate. I saw you. 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:28.669
 commenting on the briefcase he had 

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:31.550
 liked it and the team even with this 

00:04:28.669 --> 00:04:33.770
 size for sure like traveling with 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:36.770
 I'm the one who walks 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:38.750
 put the luggage and just look, you can 

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:40.910
 to see that it is a very wide 

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:43.370
 quite luggage inside is very good 

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:45.410
 are 449 liters that you think 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:47.180
 habit that only need to sure up 

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:49.660
 a family that has a baby that takes 

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:52.010
 cart these things can accommodate 

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:55.820
 quite easily very hit 

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:57.770
 Thank you very much and now you need to 

00:04:55.820 --> 00:05:00.350
 a feminine view on the design of the 

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:04.010
 new civic there in 2015 can you 

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:05.690
 I think it's good I'm an admirer of the civic I 

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:08.990
 I always really liked being a style. 

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:10.850
 It's classic and I really liked the 

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:12.320
 square with which he is the record 

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:14.300
 square bumper left a little 

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:22.669
 more sporty I liked it a lot 

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:25.030
 forced to take anyone else out of this 

00:05:22.669 --> 00:05:25.030
 date
