00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:04.290
 Hello there a Ohori old man 

00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:07.950
 here we go 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:11.280
 I will talk about Ogi this time, though 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:14.309
 It's about the sound wood of the guitar this time 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:20.279
 I'm talking about maniacs so suddenly it's wood 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:21.450
 Aichi gown This is a little bit of a big sound that influences the sound 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.280
 I hope there is 

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:29.020
 I want to talk this time, but Tamba 

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:36.100
 I would like to tell you what story this difference is in plywood 

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:42.160
 Well, first of all it's why I'm going to talk about the end board plywood, but I think it's good I'm not this I 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:44.270
 But it is in the class of the same Mikkiu Son has this I this something splashed all veneer 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:47.360
 I thought I was going to 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:49.190
 Top side bag I'd say that pale rain rider 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:51.140
 I together all this 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:53.140
 It is an all end plate 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:56.620
 It is a single number 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:59.860
 1 piece of sound I'm such things had so-called 10,000 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:06.070
 I guess this was because it was made from the moment 

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:11.350
 Guy that is not equipped with any Toka well raw guitar Oh that pickup but it is you say you Tamba 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:13.159
 a If it comes to a relatively expensive drug guitar after all because it has no microphone or anything 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:17.630
 Many also I all Tan edition 

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:19.130
 There is only an end plate and there is a good quality of it after all, so after all 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:24.500
 That little bit after all 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:30.710
 Cost is also I go up I I just I that amount I still doing 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:32.510
 After all, the gold box vibration is quite a single plate , and the vibration is transmitted so great . 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:38.240
 After all shape is good 

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:42.800
 The shape is good, but the shape is so good, so I just said something like a raw guitar 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:47.000
 After all if you want to use the end plate and you want to use the good web 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:50.640
 All-end board is good, but it's still a single board . 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:55.400
 Also, for example, that to say one plate 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:59.210
 Line a thing of two Once'm down will Hakodate softening again 

00:01:55.400 --> 00:02:03.380
 It's like half-a-half-a-day, this one by one 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:04.160
 As we may be swollen together, there are many such things recently . 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:07.040
 For example 

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:12.110
 Something also that I thought 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:12.530
 Nde some cases, or use in here Toka Toka different here one here in the wind Tteyuu one 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:16.000
 Ne 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:19.840
 Something is Well I I now do something all so will forgive gibson 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:24.510
 Chin and I Toka seek the will after all I Nde this a whole end plate Yappa 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:29.310
 After all, though I think I think I'd end plate I of I mean bought the volume also want 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:35.010
 I though Well month Hey This hey is someone first single head of 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:42.120
 Is my guy always be six consecutive pegs are using but this is not top Nee 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:44.410
 Spruce of I Tamba and back it is the side also But I do Tamba of mahogany 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:49.780
 Mao is plywood 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:54.070
 It is written that we want to put together a piece of plywood, so it is a so-called 5th piece 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:58.750
 Laminating agent is also good Laminating is a photo of the floor and mother 

00:02:54.070 --> 00:03:02.040
 There is what you can put in with felt kaanaparisupa and scissors It is not to laminate 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:05.189
 But there are words is exactly with that principle 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:11.730
 Sing and paste when pasting 

00:03:05.189 --> 00:03:16.799
 I'm pasting this hot air time, but in the same time I've pasted another one, another sound different late 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:17.549
 The quality is different. The anchor is pecked in and it is used for saying plywood 

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:21.420
 But 

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:22.060
 After all, to match the hunt and say or why courses and has still been relatively restrained 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:26.200
 So 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:26.860
 I You may also be that there is no need to choose what good likes that quality 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:29.660
 a 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:34.400
 It's very cheap cost goes down 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:36.550
 For example, there was a previous one, for example . 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:39.730
 For example, in the low price model 

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:43.480
 Such and electric acoustic guitar as Toka ne or such Takamine 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:47.680
 Hey Elpo south is really howling 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:48.910
 Maximum amazing after all the say I Toka howling because this have gained Toka pickup 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:54.310
 It's ne basis of 

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:56.230
 Vibration becomes the true manner well karaoke when I misfire Te that little ear say the howling 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:56.450
 Not say bulls cormorant Rutte in what or 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:00.000
 First of all 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:05.190
 Even if howling doesn't happen, it's as good as possible 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:10.230
 It is effective using plywood, but in the sense of preventing haring 

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:11.360
 I said it was a plywood feel, but now it is a weak point 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:16.340
 It is because I can 

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:19.730
 Danban was Once as it is also something a piece of the still high vibration something 2 vibration I Nde plate 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:24.500
 The form gets better because there is also a way to convey it 

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:26.280
 I You out with the minute after all thickness of this that ze Ease paste'll still mixed material because plywood 

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:29.790
 After all 

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:33.900
 What can I suppress? It will prevent the vibration 

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:34.710
 Made from would to watch a Bach slump to those that do not leave much Maybe volumes do 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:38.880
 Say that 

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:41.020
 Also there are various usages even if it is a lamentation version or over 

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:45.099
 That 

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:47.600
 I can not say that this is good or bad, but I just can not live 

00:04:45.099 --> 00:04:53.990
 If you want to emphasize the name 

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:59.570
 It all one also of all Tambor as shown earlier in the Well This gold Seion next issue 

00:04:53.990 --> 00:05:04.490
 Those things that make up the power together Those kind of things are still good and the volume is good too 

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:07.820
 If it is used with raw guitar something about Dale, it will not be born after all 

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:10.880
 If you still want the volume after all the end plate thing 

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:13.980
 I would like to choose all veneers if possible 

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:17.880
 Again agent to the chest again agent is someone occasionally to or stopped plywood 

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:24.780
 Where I was in the soul I think I think the best shape is good 

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:25.660
 But also for those who can not buy guitars so expensive 

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:30.970
 a 

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:35.230
 If you want to hear that sound a bit on the Eleako stage, and for those who say 

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:39.640
 There is also a case Tsuyoshi positive fist Toka-back action agent is a plywood 

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:43.690
 There are occasions when both the top and the plywood are said, but there are also cases when it is all over 

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:45.650
 However, because you want to choose something like this type of ayer solid, or there is trading on the stage 

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:50.720
 A little howling agent 

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:54.440
 Aiu for example, but the sound Na' there is or there is a tie minute hey this is a plywood 

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:58.220
 Sound that suppresses was gone whistle by when I leave Toka tight sound's 

00:05:54.440 --> 00:06:02.780
 Some say that a broken sound comes out 

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:05.150
 Well 5 to people it 's such a little want a sound that has been accompanied by the Kedomo's feeling that you 

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:05.639
 Paste the things of 

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:11.189
 Hario 

00:06:05.639 --> 00:06:11.699
 I think we should choose such sleep a thing of the san and It's plywood that had been Do and I I think 

00:06:11.189 --> 00:06:16.289
 Too 

00:06:11.699 --> 00:06:17.420
 It was those that had gained a big-up to well as fourteen fifteenth this I Saito 

00:06:16.289 --> 00:06:21.950
 It is a thing 

00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:25.370
 There is also a thing called all the end plate thing, and there is also no Gibson 2 

00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:29.540
 Nde there is to what end plate as I said a little while ago 

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:34.280
 The Well but I also do some of Tteyuu in line with that sense Ja Hey concept 

00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:35.780
 For example , there was a slight increase in techniques and bracing in this area, for example. 

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:37.440
 It may be said 

00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:41.010
 So in that sense 

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:45.930
 There are also cases where measures can be taken, but it is also 

00:06:41.010 --> 00:06:46.680
 There are exceptions to say that I also thing that all terminal even if the pickup is laden 

00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:51.180
 I will 

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:55.919
 For example, if you write solid spruce, it is an end plate thing 

00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:59.370
 Well just normally For example, if you or was written me a blues 

00:06:55.919 --> 00:07:02.090
 It is written in the guitar specs, but it is that kind of thing 

00:06:59.370 --> 00:07:05.600
 But it's often a plywood 

00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:09.830
 Well that's kinda yeah Maa short burn this time 

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:15.139
 We talked about plywood and it is very big in sound aspect 

00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:16.380
 And again, there may be a choice for us players to choose from . 

00:07:15.139 --> 00:07:19.890
 is there 

00:07:16.380 --> 00:07:24.780
 I wonder whether it is a point or endboard or plywood 

00:07:19.890 --> 00:07:25.380
 What I I if within Well you go and pull something which is also still But I'm there is a fine story 

00:07:24.780 --> 00:07:30.249
 But it's ok 

00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:35.139
 After all we will ask you how to choose a single tier or plywood. 

00:07:30.249 --> 00:07:38.829
 It will be said that it will be careful if you become careful 

00:07:35.139 --> 00:07:43.899
 It's also an interesting part of the guitar and it can't be stopped. 

00:07:38.829 --> 00:07:45.549
 Well it was a story of short bread revetment that I think it is good spring for everyone to be helpful 

00:07:43.899 --> 00:07:48.849
 Let's meet at The next time you can say 

00:07:45.549 --> 00:07:51.089
 I 'm still waiting for you 123 Tsui Cass Live
