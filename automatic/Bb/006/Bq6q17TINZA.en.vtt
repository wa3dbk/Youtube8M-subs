okay lick one of this awesome solo here
it<00:01:27.509> is<00:01:27.659> slowed<00:01:28.110> down<00:01:28.140> with<00:01:28.860> the<00:01:29.070> tabs<00:01:29.340> folks

00:01:50.499 --> 00:01:50.509 

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:53.179 

comes<00:01:51.509> right<00:01:51.659> out<00:01:51.899> of<00:01:52.140> the<00:01:52.350> pentatonic

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
comes right out of the pentatonic

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.429 
comes right out of the pentatonic
pattern<00:01:53.429> one<00:01:54.149> in<00:01:54.329> the<00:01:54.450> key<00:01:54.659> of<00:01:54.689> C<00:01:55.020> because<00:01:55.200> the

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
pattern one in the key of C because the

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:56.959 
pattern one in the key of C because the
tunes<00:01:55.649> in<00:01:55.860> the<00:01:55.950> key<00:01:56.100> of<00:01:56.130> C<00:01:56.369> so<00:01:56.399> you're<00:01:56.789> going<00:01:56.909> to

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
tunes in the key of C so you're going to

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:03.020 
tunes in the key of C so you're going to
use<00:01:57.210> that<00:01:57.799> pattern<00:01:58.799> one<00:01:59.070> minute<00:01:59.369> on<00:01:59.549> it<00:02:02.030> and

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
use that pattern one minute on it and

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.330 
use that pattern one minute on it and
then<00:02:03.689> the<00:02:04.079> cool<00:02:04.289> thing<00:02:04.439> about<00:02:04.500> it<00:02:04.679> is<00:02:04.890> it<00:02:05.100> ducks

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
then the cool thing about it is it ducks

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.789 
then the cool thing about it is it ducks
back<00:02:05.640> to<00:02:06.000> pattern<00:02:06.390> five<00:02:06.689> pentatonic<00:02:07.439> but<00:02:07.619> only

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
back to pattern five pentatonic but only

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:12.740 
back to pattern five pentatonic but only
on<00:02:07.979> string<00:02:08.280> 6<00:02:08.489> and<00:02:08.700> 5<00:02:11.150> and<00:02:12.150> I<00:02:12.239> think<00:02:12.480> the<00:02:12.569> cool

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
on string 6 and 5 and I think the cool

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:14.300 
on string 6 and 5 and I think the cool
thing<00:02:12.930> here<00:02:12.959> is<00:02:13.140> to<00:02:13.319> learn<00:02:13.440> how<00:02:13.500> to<00:02:13.799> switch

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 
thing here is to learn how to switch

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:22.490 
thing here is to learn how to switch
from<00:02:14.340> pattern<00:02:15.060> 1<00:02:16.819> down<00:02:17.819> to<00:02:18.060> pattern<00:02:18.420> 5<00:02:21.500> let's

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
from pattern 1 down to pattern 5 let's

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.470 
from pattern 1 down to pattern 5 let's
check<00:02:22.709> out<00:02:22.860> how<00:02:23.069> he<00:02:23.130> does<00:02:23.340> it<00:02:23.459> in<00:02:23.519> the<00:02:23.610> solo<00:02:23.910> so

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
check out how he does it in the solo so

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.030 
check out how he does it in the solo so
kind<00:02:24.900> of<00:02:24.959> walk<00:02:25.110> through<00:02:25.380> the<00:02:25.470> little<00:02:25.680> licks<00:02:25.860> in

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
kind of walk through the little licks in

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:27.920 
kind of walk through the little licks in
the<00:02:26.069> solo<00:02:26.340> here<00:02:26.670> so<00:02:27.180> it<00:02:27.269> starts<00:02:27.569> off<00:02:27.660> with<00:02:27.810> the

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
the solo here so it starts off with the

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:31.880 
the solo here so it starts off with the
10<00:02:28.200> half<00:02:28.530> step<00:02:28.829> Bend<00:02:30.440> so<00:02:31.440> remember<00:02:31.709> the

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:46.280 
on strings four and three it ends up on

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:48.610 
on strings four and three it ends up on
the<00:03:46.760> root<00:03:47.030> note<00:03:47.060> which<00:03:47.540> is<00:03:47.569> always<00:03:47.900> string

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:48.620 
the root note which is always string

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:51.940 
the root note which is always string
four<00:03:48.950> third<00:03:49.400> finger<00:03:49.910> in<00:03:50.090> pentatonic<00:03:50.810> one<00:03:51.019> this

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:51.950 
four third finger in pentatonic one this

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:54.000 
four third finger in pentatonic one this
whole<00:03:52.129> thing<00:03:52.370> happens<00:03:52.819> over<00:03:52.940> this<00:03:53.239> awesome

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:54.010 
whole thing happens over this awesome

00:03:54.010 --> 00:04:01.309 
whole thing happens over this awesome
C<00:03:55.010> minor<00:03:55.220> seventh<00:03:55.610> chord

00:04:01.309 --> 00:04:01.319 

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:06.809 

I<00:04:04.770> think<00:04:05.770> one<00:04:05.980> of<00:04:06.010> the<00:04:06.190> cool<00:04:06.370> things<00:04:06.400> to<00:04:06.640> take

00:04:06.809 --> 00:04:06.819 
I think one of the cool things to take

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:09.510 
I think one of the cool things to take
out<00:04:06.970> of<00:04:07.000> the<00:04:07.180> lesson<00:04:07.510> would<00:04:07.630> be<00:04:07.870> to<00:04:08.310> be<00:04:09.310> able<00:04:09.370> to

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:09.520 
out of the lesson would be to be able to

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:13.199 
out of the lesson would be to be able to
play<00:04:09.700> a<00:04:09.730> minor<00:04:10.209> 7th<00:04:10.630> chord<00:04:10.690> anywhere<00:04:11.350> so<00:04:12.209> we'll

00:04:13.199 --> 00:04:13.209 
play a minor 7th chord anywhere so we'll

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:15.990 
play a minor 7th chord anywhere so we'll
play<00:04:13.510> the<00:04:13.660> minor<00:04:13.840> 7th<00:04:14.260> to<00:04:15.040> precede<00:04:15.370> minor<00:04:15.580> 7<00:04:15.910> we

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:16.000 
play the minor 7th to precede minor 7 we

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.319 
play the minor 7th to precede minor 7 we
get<00:04:16.090> the<00:04:16.239> several<00:04:16.600> but<00:04:17.549> if<00:04:18.549> we<00:04:18.700> play<00:04:18.910> AC<00:04:19.180> minor

00:04:19.319 --> 00:04:19.329 
get the several but if we play AC minor

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:21.449
