00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
 hello everyone in the first video of 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:06.810
 cube tips from the one minute channel 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:09.750
 we have a scramble taken from the page 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:12.300
 stop timer dot net pretty easy os 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:15.120
 I encourage everyone to make it white face 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:17.779
 up green face in front to 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:21.180
 mess up I put this mixture in the 

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:23.210
 description of the video and good what you 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:26.010
 I want to say is that many times 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:27.810
 wanting to lower our times we 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.359
 timed crazy trying 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:33.270
 improve and we are actually improving 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:36.390
 little or nothing because we are repeating 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:38.640
 without any kind of sense sometimes there 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:42.840
 to get a little out of hurry and solve 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:44.820
 with pause that's why we're going to solve the 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:49.530
 cube once and then we'll go back to 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:51.870
 repeat the same scramble and we will go back to 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.789
 solve it again slowly trying 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.030
 repeat the same steps and this 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:58.610
 way we will discover 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:02.719
 if we do some extra step if we are 

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:04.430
 opting for the slower way or 

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:06.560
 with more movement if maybe there's 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:08.409
 some shortcut and we have not realized 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:13.159
 that's why we're going to improve a lot 

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:16.640
 our perception well well we will eliminate 

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:19.490
 also unnecessary pauses and also 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:21.260
 we can look for other ways of resolution 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:24.350
 do not 

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:28.040
 the good thing is above all being able to predict 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:31.010
 the movements with more speed and 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:35.240
 good if we already have a second cube is 

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:37.690
 ideal because we repeat in the other cube 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:40.370
 the same scramble and we can go 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:42.710
 resolving the two at the same time opting for 

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:44.980
 different ways to see what are the 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:48.590
 differences and so we will get 

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:50.900
 experience and we will know a little predict 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:52.520
 what is low what will happen with 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:55.219
 our cube 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:58.189
 well, this has been the video 

00:01:55.219 --> 00:02:01.579
 cubero advice today I hope you have 

00:01:58.189 --> 00:02:05.600
 liked and I encourage you to solve it 

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:08.179
 this scanner first once fast how 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:10.399
 you can do it and then tell me in 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:13.400
 the comments this first time and the 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:16.459
 second time that you do already after 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:18.140
 have solved it five or six times what 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:20.810
 we will solve much more quickly 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:23.239
 because you have already memorized well what 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:26.030
 movements you're going to have to do like this 

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:28.190
 that you can see the difference that is amazing 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:32.829
 I hope you liked it and very soon 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:32.829
 more tips and see you later
