00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
in his robot mode his head is kind of

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.450 
in his robot mode his head is kind of
cool<00:02:21.900> it<00:02:22.140> reminds<00:02:22.410> me<00:02:22.530> of<00:02:22.620> some<00:02:23.160> sort<00:02:23.370> of<00:02:23.400> like

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410 
that panel flips up and becomes his

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:31.400 
that panel flips up and becomes his
visor<00:02:28.970> for<00:02:29.970> articulation<00:02:30.420> his<00:02:30.840> arms<00:02:31.200> go<00:02:31.380> in
