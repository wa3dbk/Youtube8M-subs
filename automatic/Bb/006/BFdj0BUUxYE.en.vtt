00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:07.280 
doesn't really matter where you are the

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:10.060 
doesn't really matter where you are the
important<00:02:07.670> is<00:02:07.760> to<00:02:07.790> take<00:02:08.570> the<00:02:08.810> shape<00:02:09.110> always

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:10.070 
important is to take the shape always

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:14.290 
important is to take the shape always
the<00:02:10.190> same<00:02:10.490> and<00:02:10.759> to<00:02:11.450> slide<00:02:11.990> over<00:02:12.320> all<00:02:12.650> over<00:02:13.300> the

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:14.300 
the same and to slide over all over the

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:17.890 
the same and to slide over all over the
strings<00:02:14.690> okay<00:02:15.200> so<00:02:16.070> now<00:02:16.970> you<00:02:17.330> gotta<00:02:17.540> know<00:02:17.630> where

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:17.900 
strings okay so now you gotta know where

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:21.580 
strings okay so now you gotta know where
the<00:02:18.020> notes<00:02:18.260> are<00:02:18.530> so<00:02:19.400> basically<00:02:20.030> to<00:02:20.660> play<00:02:21.290> just

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:21.590 
the notes are so basically to play just

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:23.080 
the notes are so basically to play just
one<00:02:21.830> you<00:02:22.070> just<00:02:22.250> have<00:02:22.430> to<00:02:22.550> know<00:02:22.670> where<00:02:22.850> notes

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.090 
one you just have to know where notes

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:25.930 
one you just have to know where notes
are<00:02:23.300> on<00:02:23.510> the<00:02:24.140> first<00:02:24.350> two<00:02:24.590> strings<00:02:24.860> okay<00:02:25.340> so<00:02:25.670> on

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:25.940 
are on the first two strings okay so on

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:27.640 
are on the first two strings okay so on
the<00:02:26.930> first<00:02:27.200> strings

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650 
the first strings

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:37.900 
the first strings
notes<00:02:28.160> are<00:02:28.340> like<00:02:28.550> that<00:02:28.760> e<00:02:29.980> f<00:02:30.980> g<00:02:31.810> a<00:02:33.130> b<00:02:34.239> c<00:02:35.830> b<00:02:36.830> and<00:02:37.250> e

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:37.910 
notes are like that e f g a b c b and e

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:41.140 
notes are like that e f g a b c b and e
again<00:02:38.239> okay<00:02:38.870> so<00:02:39.340> you<00:02:40.340> probably<00:02:40.640> aware<00:02:41.090> that

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:41.150 
again okay so you probably aware that

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:44.290 
again okay so you probably aware that
the<00:02:41.780> fact<00:02:42.020> that<00:02:42.110> the<00:02:42.739> plays<00:02:43.610> on<00:02:43.940> the<00:02:44.000> first

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:44.300 
the fact that the plays on the first

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:47.620 
the fact that the plays on the first
string<00:02:44.570> correspond<00:02:45.170> to<00:02:45.320> a<00:02:45.410> and<00:02:46.280> place<00:02:47.060> on<00:02:47.420> the

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:47.630 
string correspond to a and place on the

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:50.020 
string correspond to a and place on the
second<00:02:47.989> string<00:02:48.230> so<00:02:49.040> for<00:02:49.430> instance<00:02:49.760> you<00:02:49.880> should

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:50.030 
second string so for instance you should

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:51.820 
second string so for instance you should
play<00:02:50.209> an<00:02:50.330> A<00:02:50.660> with<00:02:51.020> a<00:02:51.050> power<00:02:51.290> chord<00:02:51.680> of<00:02:51.770> the

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:51.830 
play an A with a power chord of the

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:54.699 
play an A with a power chord of the
third<00:02:52.040> string<00:02:52.480> sometime<00:02:53.480> this<00:02:53.720> that's<00:02:54.500> the

00:02:54.699 --> 00:02:54.709 
third string sometime this that's the

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:58.330 
third string sometime this that's the
same<00:02:55.010> exact<00:02:55.430> song<00:02:55.820> plus<00:02:56.750> it's<00:02:57.260> a<00:02:57.410> sound<00:02:57.770> if<00:02:58.280> you
