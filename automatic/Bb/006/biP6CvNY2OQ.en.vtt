00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.130
 I sow in general all summer and I can basilica 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:10.530
 talk endlessly I just adore him 

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:12.750
 I grow it only for family and for 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:16.020
 their relatives and friends who come 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:21.270
 to me frequent i use it in many 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:23.310
 salads and just like seasoning to meat here 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:27.930
 basil can be completely different 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:29.369
 kinds of basil green greek he here 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:33.860
 small-leaf 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:37.399
 and the Genoese basilica linkage 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:41.510
 broadleaf he will be big basil 

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:44.460
 velvet vegetable he too will be a circle 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:49.890
 Neapolitan giant giant he 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:52.860
 in general now here he is in general huge 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:56.100
 sizing grows what i do then 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.670
 purple basil is yes too he is 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:01.469
 dark 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:04.070
 I planted him you will see that I 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:07.409
 doing in the beginning I meant taking such 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:10.890
 polyethylene plastic cap 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:16.290
 or iron does not play a role and soak 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:18.750
 seeds here soak them for a day you 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.409
 see but not so to immerse a 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.560
 slightly 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:26.360
 and here you see that basil he 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.360
 become such as have 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:31.939
 covered by a special transparent 

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:35.750
 film 

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:39.180
 mucous film of its seeds here I 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:41.040
 compare for example marjoram I will plant 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.170
 winter fairy tale 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:46.710
 look here I have it already about growth 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:48.960
 same day an hour here we see see 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:51.299
 white such tails 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:55.590
 This suggests that he already sprouted and 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:02:00.950
 he can be planted around him nothing 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:06.290
 and basil you will see around basil here 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:06.290
 such as fluffy but slimy 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:15.220
 don't be scared so it should be through 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:19.140
 day you can plant for planting I 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:22.810
 I use these plastic bottles 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:27.790
 seedlings here are very convenient to plant 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:30.250
 how do i make them i cut like this 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:32.310
 way cut off the top 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:35.980
 so that it opens and closes 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:40.120
 because in case of heavy rain or 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:42.850
 strong wind and no need further with 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:50.620
 I pierce this side here 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:56.370
 such holes that was drainage for 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:03:01.420
 seedlings such as containers are very convenient 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:06.030
 see here the workshop is already planted if 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:06.030
 I must open the attic I need more 

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:14.590
 I open the sun if I do not need eyes 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:19.120
 canal except these plastic rations 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:22.060
 the containers I use also all sorts of dessert 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:28.500
 different capacities are also very convenient for me 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:32.320
 mini type whether chik further after 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:34.410
 sprouted basil in my pc containers 

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:38.470
 I him 

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:45.239
 transplanting like this cant 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:49.510
 I tilt and land on slope 

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:52.810
 basil he himself then rise with 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:55.180
 time as babies and you stack so 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:58.390
 for sure basil did i lay here right here 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:04:01.470
 purple basil will grow me 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:04.930
 and here I have different and lemon and 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:07.460
 cinnamon with cinnamon smell and lemon 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:09.740
 smell and 

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:12.560
 where is the Neapolitan hitch in general 

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:17.650
 different basilicas the same look i 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:20.540
 under the slope put on top 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:21.800
 I cover it with the ground 

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:25.250
 baby lies 

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:25.780
 and then it rises because everything 

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:32.300
 still 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:34.250
 basil it is a little capricious therefore with 

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:37.580
 they need to be gently treated like 

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:41.080
 baby here we are again tilted 

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:43.850
 put and he then later quietly 

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:47.660
 rises here as this one rose 

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:48.890
 for example or like this or this one 

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:52.370
 climbed three 

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:55.100
 and everything and you will enjoy your 

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:57.880
 basil here beside with basil 

00:04:55.100 --> 00:05:01.850
 there is a small hand next to me 

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:02.600
 she is all very little here 

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:07.330
 the kids 

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:10.940
 and here Iâ€™m probably arugula 

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:13.960
 the big one is already rampant 

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:17.480
 enjoys chua basil also 

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:20.260
 I plant in such hips we plant 

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:23.360
 rather, they are fine with me too 

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:27.460
 grow to a certain size 

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:32.980
 then transplant in the ground again 

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:35.630
 then the bottle capacity is 6 liter 

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:39.820
 look at how much variety 

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:42.850
 basil here here sheet such it 

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:46.640
 lemon basil lemon smell 

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:49.990
 further here it is basil has 

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:49.990
 cinnamon smell of cinnamon 

00:05:50.169 --> 00:06:02.860
 this basil clove has a smell 

00:05:56.240 --> 00:06:07.659
 carnations purple here this purple 

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:07.659
