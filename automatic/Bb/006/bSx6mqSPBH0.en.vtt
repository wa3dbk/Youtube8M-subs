00:00:01.369 --> 00:00:03.240
 we have enough 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.729
 today we'll have a look at some space to learn how to hair 

00:00:06.729 --> 00:00:09.169
 instead of sugar as usual 

00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:13.209
 namely pawn who the misdeeds federal do ten points in Leuk 

00:00:14.199 --> 00:00:18.230
 namely Multiple Traverse Philipp Hartmann 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.369
 what good rating test games games on this 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:25.380
 wikipedia page 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.310
 read up 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:30.599
 the eternal WDR place like the the multi 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.599
 to insert 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:37.390
 we look at the level in practice 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:41.440
 The goal is a PCI 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.050
 she has no 12 processors to attend 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:46.880
 6 

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:50.140
 each of these six processors can turn 2 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:51.700
 to 1 

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:53.500
 represent 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:56.800
 So it appears to the operating system 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:59.800
 like a twelve-core processor 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.160
 bühlmann 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:05.970
 this performance of 12 processors 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.570
 how this works system thinks it would have 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:11.170
 you have to exploit so much 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:11.990
 that too 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:13.070
 exploits 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:15.940
 consume or last several 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:18.620
 and that he is from Fürth at the same time 

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:22.590
 because everything is so fair that only one process then will be 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.590
 a CPU to be busy 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.020
 So in our CDU chronicle we see these here 

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:33.200
 CPU is 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:36.200
 which are really only six 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:38.910
 here we have one 

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:41.840
 Schüttorf and why calculator 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:43.159
 and starting from 

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:46.450
 in Zirl choir the 7 980 Giggs 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.480
 xD 

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:50.910
 x 2 min indian 

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:54.920
 because everyone's protesting so often with 3com and 3 3's aisles sda 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:00.350
 we'll see that looks different 

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:03.580
 if we have a something 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:06.880
 more elaborate Zoff the States I take here as an example 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:11.919
 like the Wii in video editing 

00:02:11.919 --> 00:02:14.780
 This is a program with which you videos were accordingly 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:17.049
 Construction work can 

00:02:17.049 --> 00:02:18.329
 and 

00:02:18.329 --> 00:02:21.199
 if he lets me do that 

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:24.879
 Let's take an example of how the EU did that in there 

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:32.109
 and leave the Unger another in another video off the tape and that's right 

00:02:32.109 --> 00:02:34.689
 two topfit 

00:02:34.689 --> 00:02:38.729
 we take the painting project attitude we say hold back 

00:02:38.729 --> 00:02:41.419
 Full HD video will be correct on Wednesday 

00:02:41.419 --> 00:02:43.169
 becomes expensive 

00:02:43.169 --> 00:02:46.169
 while use 

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:49.009
 Gummert 

00:02:49.009 --> 00:02:52.449
 in Biel 4 from Mont 

00:02:52.449 --> 00:02:55.449
 we leave the settings as they are 

00:02:56.399 --> 00:02:59.809
 can say get used to project generating after the long winter 

00:03:01.639 --> 00:03:04.639
 points 

00:03:06.009 --> 00:03:09.009
 and we want to look at the same time 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:13.319
 Processor doing this, therefore, I have the system monitoring 

00:03:14.219 --> 00:03:17.219
 at the same time in the picture frame 

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:28.399
 Now we see pretty well 

00:03:28.399 --> 00:03:30.889
 that the CPU s 

00:03:30.889 --> 00:03:33.009
 almost all Bonn with 

00:03:33.009 --> 00:03:35.199
 are busy 

00:03:35.199 --> 00:03:38.199
 to make this conversion 

00:03:40.889 --> 00:03:41.790
 like the Neat 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:43.110
 So it seems 

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:46.599
 Moody's guilty care drives so worries 

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:49.599
 so most of the CPU s 

00:03:50.169 --> 00:03:53.099
 with editing this video 

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:56.099
 are busy 

00:03:59.539 --> 00:04:02.029
 depending on the video content Aid 

00:04:02.029 --> 00:04:05.109
 the CPU is more or less loaded 

00:04:05.109 --> 00:04:09.519
 We also have some things to do with two pretensions to your hard drive 

00:04:10.689 --> 00:04:11.899
 expire 

00:04:11.899 --> 00:04:13.190
 what counts 

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:16.600
 the computer actually has less influence but it comes on the hard drives 

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:18.909
 speeds 

00:04:18.909 --> 00:04:21.909
 but here in this example, I think I'm fine 

00:04:23.029 --> 00:04:25.809
 that the CPU s 

00:04:25.809 --> 00:04:28.479
 all a little something to do 

00:04:28.479 --> 00:04:31.479
 that the processor load is distributed 

00:04:39.409 --> 00:04:41.990
 so much for Trier 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:43.349
 and the multi 

00:04:43.349 --> 00:04:46.349
 to experience 

00:04:47.659 --> 00:04:49.819
 to the Wikipedia page 

00:04:49.819 --> 00:04:51.219
 while I still 

00:04:51.219 --> 00:04:54.150
 add to the video 

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:57.150
 Rumors made the rounds and 

00:04:59.349 --> 00:05:02.349
 maybe not even more videos on these systems 

00:05:03.529 --> 00:05:07.299
 titled Cora the seventh 981 x 

00:05:08.629 --> 00:05:11.490
 x-treme Libyan 

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:13.860
 there are 12 processor cores 

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:16.129
 Viewers though physically 

00:05:16.129 --> 00:05:16.819
 just 

00:05:16.819 --> 00:05:19.819
 in quotation marks sex-cutting sex 

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:23.580
 I hope wins here 

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:24.669
 To have Poulsen 

00:05:24.669 --> 00:05:26.210
 Papageno sincerely
