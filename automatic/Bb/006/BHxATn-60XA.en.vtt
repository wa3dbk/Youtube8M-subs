 Well, here is such a well, well, let's 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:02.220
 move on to the test will experience 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:06.310
 our plates are a fist I already painted 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:08.610
 so here we have it means we take 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:12.010
 nail polish remover with acetone 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:26.130
 sure to be cotton with acetone 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:30.300
 disc wipe stamping well 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:30.300
 we rub itself stamp 

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:39.140
 take evil you can take absolutely normal 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:50.780
 here is my 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:03:02.140
 which I take here is painting varnish and doing 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:03:08.480
 it quickly enough all the color was removed 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:13.190
 They took a stamp from you transferred here like this 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:23.150
 so he transferred a finger and take it like this 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:27.560
 way and at once you can 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:33.290
 return line but do not remove do not remove the stamp 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:36.560
 and here we enter here and so here is the principle 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:41.350
 it turned out like this now on the second hand 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:41.350
 do it again wipe the die 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:04:03.130
 We take paws in the same place in a quick eraser 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:04:18.209
 we put it just as well means we choose 

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:29.190
 and doing on the other hand in the same way 

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:29.190
 so back here so here and so 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:38.229
 wipe even at 1 so the second finger 

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:40.830

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:46.560
