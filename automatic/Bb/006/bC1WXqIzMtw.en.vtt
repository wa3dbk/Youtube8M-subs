00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:29.119
 hello everyone guys here agsm bending e 

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:32.450
 we are again thanks to cooler master 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:34.309
 here to make new unboxing today 

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:38.380
 we are with the sink with the roma sta 

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:41.090
 hyper 212 evo as before a heat sink 

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:42.860
 that unlike what they do 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:45.050
 maybe see so many youtubes anyway 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:47.120
 they buy almost everyone with prediction they are 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:50.000
 the liquid galactic mega 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:51.470
 who so giants so commissive to give 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.260
 much more tiny much more user 

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:56.660
 friendly that serves for those who do not have huge 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:59.120
 needs like I took a computer 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:02.750
 that I don't care to do or for some 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:04.729
 reason a normal i7 3700 70 processor 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:05.930
 and I just needed to lower it 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:08.509
 slightly temperatures for 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:10.220
 this summer because I had the 

00:01:08.509 --> 00:01:12.080
 meanwhile you see here standard sink 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:15.289
 a little black because he was killing me 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:16.820
 to do the unboxing anyway I had some 

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:18.710
 high enough temperatures four 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:20.780
 standard power sailors and carried them 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:23.869
 on 80 90 degrees and it wasn't for nothing 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:28.150
 the case then decided precisely to mount 

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:30.740
 this sink without too many needs 

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:33.799
 discuss from the really low price 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:35.810
 compared to the competition and the value of 

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:38.840
 this type you will keep around 30 euros 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:40.700
 via the online but also a little bit 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:43.040
 in short, 30 euros and the line 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:44.299
 theoretical and therefore you can find it 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:46.040
 quietly in this range of 

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:48.439
 price and really good like 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:49.710
 heatsink in fact the temperatures that 

00:01:48.439 --> 00:01:54.690
 they came down 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:56.159
 from almost 90 degrees I had to well 60 65 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:02:00.000
 degrees and so there was a decline of 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:02.369
 temperatures of 25 30 degrees and for a 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.600
 This band's sink is really 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:06.180
 awesome 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:08.850
 you can see of the throne of 3 fucking 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:10.800
 that offers us the master cooler there was a 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:13.560
 only one hand fan can fit 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:16.680
 one behind and there is ours 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:19.250
 heat sink and inside the box 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:22.170
 all the screws are the thermal paste 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:23.700
 very useful because other companions 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:25.140
 they have our broad term in the 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:29.940
 their recipients instead of the 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:32.580
 The master then there are offers from all 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:35.100
 networks for assembly and the manual that 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:36.510
 it's really perfect guys i never have 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:37.860
 saw a manual in my life but this 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:40.440
 here was really an epic thing 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:42.959
 because it was written in detail what 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:44.190
 you need to do and what's not and it seems there will here 

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:45.840
 I'm showing , I didn't do it 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:47.370
 see how you could count part behind but 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:49.410
 simply support for ours 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:51.540
 sink with the screws where we will go 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:53.730
 inhabit the heat sink now 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:55.799
 a fast sequence will start 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:57.450
 of the beautiful assembly two hours that 

00:02:55.799 --> 00:02:58.980
 obviously I didn't put you in the details 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:00.780
 because i was pretty of nick ha 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:03.420
 because it took me a while to mount it 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:03.959
 but a normal person he would put 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:06.900
 little 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:08.610
 it took me about a quarter of an hour e 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:10.950
 here in this case I am applying the 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:14.790
 thermal paste on the processor has used 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:16.200
 how could you see what the 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:20.040
 transparent film that is used 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:22.320
 normally for per took off 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:23.870
 closing the food we say only serves 

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:26.120
 precisely for not 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:27.860
 to spread our pasta better 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:29.810
 thermal and here we are going to mount the 

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:33.140
 our protests up there waste disposers 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:35.470
 sorry guys i mean i am 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:38.090
 was impressed because it really was 

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:39.650
 a really great heat sink thing 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:42.440
 temperatures have fallen what they must 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:43.849
 being the price is excellent 

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:48.680
 I really feel like saying this 

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:50.739
 here as I will see at the end of the pd 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:54.170
 between the pros and cons 

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:55.760
 it has no faults really long mine 

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:58.190
 things asked was a little stupid that 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:59.989
 attached the pins of fortune in a 

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:03.200
 second later after having assembled 

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:04.549
 all the gold record so I had 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:07.069
 a bit of difficulty putting the pin 

00:04:04.549 --> 00:04:09.079
 of the fan to make it work 

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:11.450
 but I have to say that if you maybe attack 

00:04:09.079 --> 00:04:12.829
 here the first spaces to the end 

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:15.079
 of fortune to leave the pot a 

00:04:12.829 --> 00:04:18.440
 little on the ramps let's say and then 

00:04:15.079 --> 00:04:18.949
 mounted the visitor will come more 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:21.440
 easy 

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:23.570
 and in any case these guys do 

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:24.320
 could not really exceptional 

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:27.199
 defects 

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:27.800
 for those who do not have great needs, I do 

00:04:27.199 --> 00:04:30.260
 council 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:34.639
 there are other players with this one 

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:37.789
 material dissipation quality of 

00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:39.680
 all all to an exceptional thing in 

00:04:37.789 --> 00:04:41.630
 all this is really if you have seen the 

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:43.760
 my other reviews I never said 

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:45.740
 which were only positive but there were 

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:47.570
 even the faults this sink 

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:49.010
 instead it has no flaws it is really great 

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:50.720
 yes it can be added 

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:53.449
 even a second fan then 

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:55.880
 lower temperatures further 

00:04:53.449 --> 00:04:57.979
 so guys I recommend it to everyone 

00:04:55.880 --> 00:05:01.130
 how many especially for those who do not have large 

00:04:57.979 --> 00:05:02.720
 maybe it needs needs orgy 

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:04.760
 must take the most advanced models e 

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:06.590
 however a dress though books but for 

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:08.740
 those like me who just have to lower 

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:10.750
 the temperature maybe for the summer that 

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:13.690
 gets close 

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:15.460
 I recommend it then guys there 

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:17.140
 I leave at the end of the editing and between 

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:19.630
 against only celebrated writings 

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:20.860
 read and nothing, kid, I greet you 

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:22.270
 on the docked dock 

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:25.920
 thank you again cooler master has 

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:25.920
 and with a casey shaw bomb 

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:51.260
 fearless 

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:58.210
 Now
