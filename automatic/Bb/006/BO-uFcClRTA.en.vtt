so<00:00:07.319> in<00:00:07.680> order<00:00:08.040> to<00:00:08.340> follow<00:00:08.639> a<00:00:08.790> line<00:00:09.180> what<00:00:09.719> we

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:09.840 
so in order to follow a line what we

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:11.299 
so in order to follow a line what we
really<00:00:10.170> are<00:00:10.290> doing<00:00:10.410> is<00:00:10.620> following<00:00:11.010> the<00:00:11.100> edge

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
really are doing is following the edge

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:14.419 
really are doing is following the edge
of<00:00:11.610> the<00:00:11.790> line<00:00:12.059> and<00:00:12.389> with<00:00:13.139> one<00:00:13.500> light<00:00:13.920> sensor

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
of the line and with one light sensor

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:16.310 
of the line and with one light sensor
it's<00:00:14.969> going<00:00:15.210> to<00:00:15.300> either<00:00:15.420> be<00:00:15.570> saying<00:00:15.960> the<00:00:16.080> dark

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
it's going to either be saying the dark

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.740 
it's going to either be saying the dark
or<00:00:16.560> the<00:00:16.680> light<00:00:16.890> when<00:00:17.400> it's<00:00:17.550> over<00:00:17.790> the<00:00:17.910> dark<00:00:18.210> it

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
or the light when it's over the dark it

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.230 
or the light when it's over the dark it
needs<00:00:19.020> to<00:00:19.230> turn<00:00:19.439> one<00:00:20.250> way<00:00:20.430> and<00:00:20.699> when<00:00:20.789> it's<00:00:20.970> over

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
needs to turn one way and when it's over

needs to turn one way and when it's over
the<00:00:21.330> light<00:00:21.539> it<00:00:21.779> needs<00:00:21.930> to<00:00:22.170> turn<00:00:22.350> the<00:00:22.529> other<00:00:22.740> a

couple of the things to keep in mind is

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:27.590 
couple of the things to keep in mind is
that<00:00:26.220> you<00:00:26.340> want<00:00:26.550> to<00:00:26.609> start<00:00:27.000> with<00:00:27.269> the<00:00:27.390> light

sensor on the line you want to keep the

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.439 
sensor on the line you want to keep the
light<00:00:31.830> sensor<00:00:32.250> between<00:00:32.640> about<00:00:32.820> an<00:00:33.000> eighth<00:00:33.210> and

surface that you're going over and it
pointing<00:00:37.530> straight<00:00:37.770> down<00:00:38.130> that<00:00:38.880> will<00:00:39.030> prevent

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
pointing straight down that will prevent

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.139 
pointing straight down that will prevent
some<00:00:39.630> reflective<00:00:40.700> interference<00:00:41.700> from<00:00:41.850> lights

has one light sensor attached to it and
we<00:01:14.190> want<00:01:14.369> to<00:01:14.550> build<00:01:14.760> a<00:01:15.030> program<00:01:15.690> that's<00:01:16.140> going

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
we want to build a program that's going

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:19.340 
we want to build a program that's going
to<00:01:16.440> follow<00:01:16.590> the<00:01:16.860> edge<00:01:17.009> of<00:01:17.280> that<00:01:17.460> line<00:01:17.900> well<00:01:18.900> we

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
to follow the edge of that line well we

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.649 
to follow the edge of that line well we
have<00:01:19.500> down<00:01:19.740> on<00:01:19.920> the<00:01:20.040> table<00:01:20.430> now<00:01:21.270> the<00:01:21.360> first

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
have down on the table now the first

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:22.850 
have down on the table now the first
thing<00:01:21.810> I'm<00:01:21.960> going<00:01:22.080> to<00:01:22.140> do<00:01:22.290> is<00:01:22.470> I'm<00:01:22.619> going<00:01:22.680> to

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
thing I'm going to do is I'm going to

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.950 
thing I'm going to do is I'm going to
put<00:01:23.070> a<00:01:23.100> loop<00:01:23.340> in<00:01:23.610> because<00:01:24.180> what<00:01:24.360> we<00:01:24.479> need<00:01:24.630> to<00:01:24.810> do

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
put a loop in because what we need to do

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.350 
put a loop in because what we need to do
is<00:01:25.170> ask<00:01:25.409> ourselves<00:01:26.040> over<00:01:26.490> and<00:01:26.520> over<00:01:27.060> and<00:01:27.149> over

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
is ask ourselves over and over and over

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.260 
is ask ourselves over and over and over
am<00:01:28.140> I<00:01:28.500> on<00:01:28.530> the<00:01:28.800> line<00:01:29.009> where<00:01:29.340> am<00:01:29.550> i<00:01:29.640> off<00:01:29.850> the<00:01:29.880> line

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
am I on the line where am i off the line

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.499 
am I on the line where am i off the line
if<00:01:30.990> I'm<00:01:31.200> on<00:01:31.409> the<00:01:31.619> line<00:01:31.770> do<00:01:32.100> one<00:01:32.369> thing<00:01:32.610> and<00:01:33.060> if

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
if I'm on the line do one thing and if

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.450 
if I'm on the line do one thing and if
I'm<00:01:33.659> off<00:01:33.899> the<00:01:34.110> line<00:01:34.290> do<00:01:34.530> something<00:01:34.979> else<00:01:35.160> and

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
I'm off the line do something else and

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.790 
I'm off the line do something else and
we<00:01:36.360> need<00:01:36.509> to<00:01:36.630> do<00:01:36.750> that<00:01:36.899> over<00:01:37.110> and<00:01:37.289> over<00:01:37.350> so<00:01:37.679> we

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:37.800 
we need to do that over and over so we

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:41.480 
we need to do that over and over so we
put<00:01:38.009> that<00:01:38.039> inside<00:01:38.640> of<00:01:38.670> a<00:01:39.030> loop<00:01:39.500> now<00:01:40.500> we<00:01:41.160> need<00:01:41.340> to

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
put that inside of a loop now we need to

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.810 
put that inside of a loop now we need to
ask<00:01:41.670> the<00:01:41.970> question<00:01:42.740> light<00:01:43.740> or<00:01:43.979> dark<00:01:44.009> and<00:01:44.520> we

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
ask the question light or dark and we

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.180 
ask the question light or dark and we
use<00:01:45.030> a<00:01:45.060> switch<00:01:45.539> for<00:01:45.810> that<00:01:45.990> we<00:01:46.679> just<00:01:46.860> bring<00:01:47.070> it

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:47.190 
use a switch for that we just bring it

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:48.980 
use a switch for that we just bring it
up<00:01:47.280> and<00:01:47.490> drop<00:01:47.700> it<00:01:47.729> here<00:01:48.119> you'll<00:01:48.539> notice<00:01:48.720> the

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
up and drop it here you'll notice the

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.710 
up and drop it here you'll notice the
default<00:01:49.440> is<00:01:49.590> to<00:01:49.619> pop<00:01:49.890> up<00:01:50.130> with<00:01:50.520> a<00:01:50.580> touch<00:01:51.240> sensor

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
default is to pop up with a touch sensor

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.300 
default is to pop up with a touch sensor
so<00:01:52.289> we're<00:01:52.380> going<00:01:52.470> to<00:01:52.530> go<00:01:52.649> down<00:01:52.860> here<00:01:53.220> and

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
so we're going to go down here and

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.359 
so we're going to go down here and
select<00:01:53.610> light<00:01:54.300> sensor<00:01:54.869> and<00:01:55.830> you'll<00:01:55.950> notice<00:01:56.130> it

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:24.329 
I've written my program I think it's

00:02:24.329 --> 00:02:26.509 
I've written my program I think it's
backwards<00:02:24.600> all<00:02:25.290> I<00:02:25.350> have<00:02:25.620> to<00:02:25.709> do<00:02:25.829> is<00:02:26.010> flip<00:02:26.310> this

00:02:26.509 --> 00:02:26.519 
backwards all I have to do is flip this

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:29.210 
backwards all I have to do is flip this
little<00:02:27.180> button<00:02:27.570> right<00:02:27.600> there<00:02:27.780> I<00:02:28.170> can<00:02:28.980> also

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
little button right there I can also

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.400 
little button right there I can also
change<00:02:29.579> the<00:02:29.760> value<00:02:30.150> from<00:02:30.390> 50<00:02:30.870> to<00:02:31.079> some<00:02:31.260> other

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
change the value from 50 to some other

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:33.770

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
right I'm going to leave it at 50 I know

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:38.539 
right I'm going to leave it at 50 I know
that<00:02:36.180> happens<00:02:36.329> to<00:02:36.600> work<00:02:36.720> with<00:02:36.930> our<00:02:37.049> table<00:02:37.549> so

00:02:38.539 --> 00:02:38.549 
that happens to work with our table so

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:41.199 
that happens to work with our table so
if<00:02:39.030> it's<00:02:39.600> light<00:02:39.840> what<00:02:40.200> I'm<00:02:40.290> going<00:02:40.440> to<00:02:40.470> do<00:02:40.650> is

00:02:41.199 --> 00:02:41.209 
if it's light what I'm going to do is

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:45.560 
if it's light what I'm going to do is
I'm<00:02:42.209> going<00:02:42.360> to<00:02:42.420> turn<00:02:42.570> on<00:02:42.630> the<00:02:42.930> B<00:02:43.079> motor<00:02:43.380> and<00:02:44.570> I'm

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:45.570 
I'm going to turn on the B motor and I'm

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:49.039 
I'm going to turn on the B motor and I'm
going<00:02:45.720> to<00:02:45.780> run<00:02:45.959> it<00:02:46.109> unlimited<00:02:47.750> so<00:02:48.750> it's<00:02:48.900> going

00:02:49.039 --> 00:02:49.049 
going to run it unlimited so it's going

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:51.979 
going to run it unlimited so it's going
to<00:02:49.109> run<00:02:49.290> until<00:02:49.500> I<00:02:49.650> tell<00:02:49.920> it<00:02:50.040> otherwise<00:02:50.459> and<00:02:51.239> I'm

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:51.989 
to run until I tell it otherwise and I'm

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:57.490 
to run until I tell it otherwise and I'm
going<00:02:52.230> to<00:02:52.290> turn<00:02:52.470> off<00:02:52.739> the<00:02:53.160> C<00:02:53.400> motor

going<00:03:07.800> to<00:03:07.860> do<00:03:07.950> the<00:03:08.069> opposite<00:03:08.610> I'm<00:03:09.269> going<00:03:09.450> to

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
going to do the opposite I'm going to

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:13.820 
going to do the opposite I'm going to
turn<00:03:09.690> the<00:03:09.870> C<00:03:10.110> motor<00:03:10.349> on<00:03:11.660> unlimited<00:03:12.660> and<00:03:12.840> I'm

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:13.830 
turn the C motor on unlimited and I'm

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:20.100 
turn the C motor on unlimited and I'm
going<00:03:14.040> to<00:03:14.099> turn<00:03:14.340> the<00:03:14.550> B<00:03:14.700> motor<00:03:14.940> off

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:21.550 
and you have to remember that just

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:23.130 
and you have to remember that just
because<00:03:21.760> I've<00:03:22.120> turned<00:03:22.270> the<00:03:22.450> B<00:03:22.630> motor<00:03:22.870> on<00:03:23.110> it

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:23.140 
because I've turned the B motor on it

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:25.140 
because I've turned the B motor on it
has<00:03:23.530> nothing<00:03:24.010> to<00:03:24.040> do<00:03:24.250> with<00:03:24.280> whatever's<00:03:24.880> going

turn the C on I have to remember to turn
the<00:03:29.890> B<00:03:30.040> motor<00:03:30.280> off<00:03:30.900> so<00:03:32.670> let's<00:03:33.670> turn<00:03:33.820> that<00:03:34.000> one

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:34.120 
the B motor off so let's turn that one

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:38.100 
the B motor off so let's turn that one
off<00:03:34.180> as<00:03:34.480> well<00:03:34.690> they're<00:03:35.560> so<00:03:36.480> unlimited<00:03:37.480> and<00:03:37.630> off
