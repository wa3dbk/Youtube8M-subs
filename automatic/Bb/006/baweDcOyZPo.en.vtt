00:00:03.529 --> 00:00:06.529
 Nightwash 

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:13.879
 thumann very first stand up occurs 

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:16.400
 I had looked at such a small mix 

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:17.750
 in munich how is the hamas power 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:19.400
 I friend myself because the I moderate 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:20.810
 and he once said otherwise 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:21.980
 also occurs in a failed 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:23.509
 in fact that was it 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:29.119
 clear at least five days before 

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:31.160
 and then I had to write something yes 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:32.180
 was only a small number and the same 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:33.470
 but I was still in the protection of 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:35.480
 moderators I could then break off 

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:38.320
 if she could have stopped me then 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:38.320
 if it did not work 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.890
 rather already the experiences than as 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.460
 Negrer in Bavaria you have to sometimes 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.350
 speak to 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.760
 that was something special 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.370
 I just recommend painting black 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:59.010
 turn a useful bavaria into a round one 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:01:00.899
 there you are fine it is about mine 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.010
 my childhood as in the village i am 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:04.229
 in such a smaller community 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:09.300
 grew up and so were the 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:11.490
 Ghosts of the people there so female 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:11.869
 in the program before very short but minimal 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.490
 is 

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:16.910
 yodel whatever I have long 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.910
 more cleared 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.610
 the who 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:33.060
 Here comes a second person 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.750
 that's why the sound of model sounds a bit lame 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.750
 against each other 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:40.780
 I have with the acting 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:41.950
 I started acting school 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:44.740
 made and still am 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:46.660
 actor and the other have you 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:48.490
 to or just as I said just pure 

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:50.730
 pushed or less what makes 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:50.730
 fun 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:56.729
 In any case, that 's what's up 

00:01:55.289 --> 00:01:58.560
 It is difficult to stop everything 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:59.820
 write it you are staging you in 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.020
 the end effect you have nobody on the 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:03.409
 decided to act can 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.700
 you always say shit or shit 

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:07.560
 the text appears then it was just the 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.940
 greta is guilty and you have to stop 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.530
 react much more to the audience 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.480
 act it through staged 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.980
 play by what I want 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.090
 and here you have to look what not 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:17.190
 might work must notify 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:19.080
 but it is different 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:20.340
 also cool that you just get out for a second 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:22.140
 can jump and stop with the people 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:24.980
 maybe a few gags or she does 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.980
 insulted whatever 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:32.010
 so i am that young what i see and so 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:33.450
 I think they are loud to see if 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:34.980
 which are also grateful not as this 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:37.469
 i think cologne i am as munich 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:38.579
 meyer in a comfortable situation in 

00:02:37.469 --> 00:02:40.200
 the cologne are a bit comedy 

00:02:38.579 --> 00:02:43.640
 spoiled there is so much why are 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:43.640
 you might see more critically 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:48.780
 yes, so you also have as an actor 

00:02:46.439 --> 00:02:50.670
 I'm an 80 year old actress too 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:53.400
 still lamp fever before the premiere 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:54.629
 and here, too, because you are 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.760
 stop yourself on the stage and stands 

00:02:54.629 --> 00:02:58.349
 It is your own fault and you always have 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:00.810
 fear that he will ignite the gags and man 

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:02.099
 I know my time must now anyway 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:04.139
 play through I can just go 

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:05.370
 and start crying or you should 

00:03:04.139 --> 00:03:09.680
 you start to cry maybe it is 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:09.680
 succeeded in an alternative as levies 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:16.819
 Mostly I should get my penis out now 

00:03:13.939 --> 00:03:19.930
 everything is nonsense I try to do so 

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:19.930
 as if it had not been a gag 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:28.459
 So yes, I am now only times when the 

00:03:26.329 --> 00:03:30.500
 clubhouse open bavarian damn 

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:31.610
 a lot of foreign stations do yes I want 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:33.500
 see and then at the stent 

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:35.900
 migrants is the second season 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:37.400
 right in the middle of it and there I am in three 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:38.450
 I think so or weeks to see 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:41.480
 not exactly when the broadcast date 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:43.010
 is and then I have a web comedy 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:44.870
 The series is Miami 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:47.299
 there you can google it and 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:48.920
 my colleagues with some and the 

00:03:47.299 --> 00:03:53.389
 There are also new ones as usual 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:54.019
 curious how the arrive I believe 

00:03:53.389 --> 00:03:55.730
 beautiful 

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:58.209
 you can stay where you used to be 

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:59.959
 just somehow for years through yet 

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:01.879
 somehow we have to go crazy 

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:03.049
 can now over the network just yet 

00:04:01.879 --> 00:04:04.579
 somehow a bit of a name 

00:04:03.049 --> 00:04:06.980
 and then you come to cologne 

00:04:04.579 --> 00:04:07.879
 and then there are 30 people or 50 

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:09.139
 because they have already seen you 

00:04:07.879 --> 00:04:11.239
 you are not always the absolute 

00:04:09.139 --> 00:04:13.480
 newey if you are a good thing on youtube 

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:13.480
 ceased 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:20.829
 yes, I'm pretty fresh myself 

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:22.180
 i am also offspring comedian too 

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:24.460
 when I'm already wrinkled and gray 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:26.020
 but I really think you have to 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:28.210
 Just play as much as you can because 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:30.250
 also by mistake and by that 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:30.729
 people do not laugh faltmann his 

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:33.009
 program 

00:04:30.729 --> 00:04:35.860
 So then you have to trust only pointed 

00:04:33.009 --> 00:04:39.490
 and then it is already full as the train 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:42.870
 was to munich and suddenly speaks 

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:44.680
 I can mean his hand in my cock 

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:47.860
 and I turn around 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:48.490
 there is somehow 100 38-year-old woman 

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:52.090
 behind me 

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:54.840
 grins at me without 10 and sometimes like 

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:54.840
 a sheep
