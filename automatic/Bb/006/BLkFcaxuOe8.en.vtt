00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.330
 Hello youtube and welcome to one 

00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:05.850
 new technology builds your video we have 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:09.599
 here the apple original dock for that 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:11.490
 iphone 5 c the rear of the lightning adapter 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:14.519
 rows of audio output works 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:19.020
 also perfect problem with the device 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:22.199
 is 29 euros and yes your iphone 5 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.910
 c just fit in and not later than 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.539
 if you pull it out then 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.019
 wanted 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:29.400
 the disadvantage of such plastikbox it sits 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:30.779
 but ok in there too 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.160
 viewing angle if that on the 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:34.290
 desk stands or dessert 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.579
 or anywhere else that fits you can be comfortable 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.989
 bags and a bag on it 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.180
 work a bit without me here 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:41.820
 big, what moves he makes the rubber 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:44.700
 under the surface and for all those themselves 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.300
 ask now synonymous fits my five it 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.090
 purely 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.620
 yes it fits in it works too 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.690
 here it is loaded 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.730
 since there is no difference to recognize it 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.829
 of course has a lot more play but 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:59.670
 if I press on it wobbles too 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:01.199
 no more or less old 5c's 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.229
 difference is of course that it is here 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:06.810
 is wider without ever 1 5 s dog 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:08.700
 to have had in hand what also 29 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.860
 euro would cost me from the 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.619
 put windows and claim that five it 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:16.590
 fits into the dock but that does not fit into the 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:19.770
 dock from 5 and if we still have 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:22.229
 want to complete the five has here 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:26.340
 the same dimensions as the 5 it 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:28.680
 So do not stop the 5 it works 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.210
 synonymous with the thing synonymous no problem 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.170
 Of course, the same problem everywhere 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.509
 pull out 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.909
 you have the problem this easy 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:39.090
 Plastic things are so difficult 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:41.159
 Therefore, my alternative rather like that 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.590
 an old kickstarter project 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:45.090
 heavy aluminum block that lifts 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.799
 Of course, depending on the angle like me 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.810
 that will get out of here, too 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:51.380
 but remains in most change 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:55.020
 but comfortably on the desk 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:56.219
 personally 29 euro film plastic but me 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.100
 do not know even at the 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:02:00.659
 functioning audio out there 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.780
 I would rather still to 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:05.159
 a few euros china aftermarket product 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.350
 want to grab 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:11.209
 so that was many thanks for watching 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:11.209
 do it well and see you for the next video
