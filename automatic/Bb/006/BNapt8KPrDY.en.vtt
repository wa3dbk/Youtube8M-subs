line<00:02:17.620> it<00:02:17.650> up<00:02:17.920> it's<00:02:18.489> pretty<00:02:18.670> cool<00:02:21.450> but<00:02:22.530> overall

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530 
line it up it's pretty cool but overall

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:28.289 
line it up it's pretty cool but overall
it's<00:02:23.859> pretty<00:02:24.629> nice<00:02:26.670> it<00:02:27.670> was<00:02:27.849> this<00:02:28.000> was<00:02:28.180> my

it's pretty nice it was this was my

00:02:28.299 --> 00:02:30.930 
it's pretty nice it was this was my
first<00:02:28.510> time<00:02:28.690> making<00:02:28.900> me<00:02:29.170> a<00:02:29.200> weapon<00:02:29.379> and<00:02:29.940> I

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:30.940 
first time making me a weapon and I

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:33.089
