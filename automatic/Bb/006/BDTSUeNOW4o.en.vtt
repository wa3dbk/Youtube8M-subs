00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:10.360

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:13.330
 and today I'm going to show you these memories 

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:19.720
 that are the things should game is a 

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:23.220
 pack of 16 gb ddr3 to 1600 megahertz and 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:26.609
 two tablets of 8 gb come 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:28.769
 well this is not much to show but 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:33.169
 I want to show you the memories are 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:33.169
 pretty and a very nice sink 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.839
 here 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:56.750
 register courses 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:59.600
 come 2 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:02.120
 there are two series of revenge and some that 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:03.890
 are the normal ones and are there 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:07.720
 others that you will find with a 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:07.720
 reference that says lp 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:18.210
 lp is for low profile and they are shorter 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:21.110
 that allow use 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:23.600
 high dissipators 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:26.360
 suddenly you can afford it or 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:28.070
 some women who have heatsinks 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:30.390
 high that can interfere with the voice 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:33.590
 with memories 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.590
 she and well a pill 

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:38.859
 and here is the other 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:42.219
 As I was saying, it's two pills each 

00:01:38.859 --> 00:01:44.439
 one of 8 gb 

00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:48.549
 which allows for example in the case 

00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:52.649
 of the majorities devour intel and amd e 

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:54.789
 intel 1155 use the 32 gb 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:57.630
 available that they have because if we put 

00:01:54.789 --> 00:02:02.520
 the rolls of 4 have a maximum of 16 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:02.520
 here in two come 16 gb 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:08.319
 and we can 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:10.390
 use them and have two is the free ones in 

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:13.739
 most motherboards especially 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:18.400
 the high performance ones that come with 

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:21.870
 four slots available to have a 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:24.870
 maximum of 32 here we can see the 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:24.870
 memoirs 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:31.020
 if you can see here the heatsink 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:33.690
 is high 

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:35.970
 anticipator 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:39.000
 in aluminum 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:42.980
 and measuring about some two 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:46.610
 centimeters above the 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:48.500
 of the profile of the memory or of it or of the 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:51.110
 pcb of memory that we stay from 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:55.220
 green color is basically like having 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:57.620
 two memories in size that I say for 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:59.959
 who are thinking of using these 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:02.989
 memories with heat sinks 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:06.290
 great good that was the things of 

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:09.040
 manganese 16 gb ddr3 I hope that they 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:09.040
 liked the video
