make sure to peel off all of that
mother's<00:03:28.379> done<00:03:28.680> and<00:03:29.010> you're<00:03:29.670> just<00:03:29.849> left<00:03:30.000> with

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
mother's done and you're just left with

mother's done and you're just left with
that<00:03:30.180> all<00:03:30.420> these<00:03:30.569> nodules<00:03:30.810> of<00:03:31.170> roots<00:03:31.579> this<00:03:32.579> is

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:32.790 
that all these nodules of roots this is

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:35.110 
that all these nodules of roots this is
probable<00:03:33.180> simple<00:03:33.599> way<00:03:33.720> to<00:03:34.260> plant<00:03:34.530> a<00:03:34.620> clipping

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:35.120 
probable simple way to plant a clipping

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:39.259 
probable simple way to plant a clipping
because<00:03:37.190> you<00:03:38.190> just<00:03:38.370> shove<00:03:38.579> it<00:03:38.609> in<00:03:38.760> as<00:03:38.910> deep<00:03:39.120> as

00:03:39.259 --> 00:03:39.269 
because you just shove it in as deep as

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:41.300 
because you just shove it in as deep as
you<00:03:39.299> want<00:03:39.419> it<00:03:39.720> there's<00:03:40.169> really<00:03:40.590> no<00:03:40.829> level<00:03:41.220> of

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:41.310 
you want it there's really no level of

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:43.640 
you want it there's really no level of
depth<00:03:41.730> that's<00:03:42.329> too<00:03:42.780> deep<00:03:43.019> for<00:03:43.049> these<00:03:43.379> plants

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:43.650 
depth that's too deep for these plants

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:47.270 
depth that's too deep for these plants
because<00:03:44.010> they'll<00:03:44.910> grow<00:03:45.239> any<00:03:46.169> time<00:03:47.010> they're

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:47.280 
because they'll grow any time they're

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:50.770 
because they'll grow any time they're
put<00:03:47.459> into<00:03:47.669> soil<00:03:48.000> because<00:03:48.810> they're<00:03:48.959> a<00:03:48.989> vine<00:03:49.319> and

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:50.780 
put into soil because they're a vine and

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:53.330 
put into soil because they're a vine and
vining<00:03:51.780> plants<00:03:52.169> will<00:03:52.319> do<00:03:52.500> that<00:03:52.680> much<00:03:53.160> like

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:53.340 
vining plants will do that much like

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:55.819 
vining plants will do that much like
tomatoes<00:03:53.760> where<00:03:54.629> any<00:03:54.930> part<00:03:55.230> of<00:03:55.290> the<00:03:55.410> stem<00:03:55.680> that

00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:55.829 
tomatoes where any part of the stem that

00:03:55.829 --> 00:03:58.789 
tomatoes where any part of the stem that
touches<00:03:56.310> the<00:03:56.639> ground<00:03:57.079> will<00:03:58.079> turn<00:03:58.290> into<00:03:58.440> a<00:03:58.530> root

00:03:58.789 --> 00:03:58.799 
touches the ground will turn into a root

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:01.280 
touches the ground will turn into a root
so<00:03:59.579> you<00:03:59.609> should<00:03:59.879> press<00:04:00.060> the<00:04:00.209> dirt<00:04:00.389> around<00:04:00.510> this

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:01.290 
so you should press the dirt around this

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:03.040 
so you should press the dirt around this
stem

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:03.050 
stem

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:06.620 
stem
and<00:04:04.050> it's<00:04:04.230> all<00:04:04.320> set<00:04:04.850> and<00:04:05.850> that's<00:04:05.970> that's<00:04:06.480> a

and it's all set and that's that's a

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:08.350 
and it's all set and that's that's a
beautiful<00:04:06.840> house<00:04:07.080> plant<00:04:07.320> right<00:04:07.440> in<00:04:07.500> itself

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:39.660 
really good when they drape see is if

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:40.560 
you have it on the edge of a table

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:43.310 
you have it on the edge of a table
you're<00:04:41.280> swimming<00:04:41.700> if<00:04:42.510> you<00:04:42.660> have<00:04:42.750> if<00:04:43.140> you<00:04:43.200> have

on<00:04:43.410> the<00:04:43.500> end<00:04:43.620> of<00:04:43.650> a<00:04:43.740> table<00:04:43.860> they<00:04:44.100> drape<00:04:44.370> down

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:44.610 
on the end of a table they drape down

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:48.320 
on the end of a table they drape down
and<00:04:44.940> they<00:04:45.000> can<00:04:45.180> cover<00:04:45.870> up<00:04:46.020> some<00:04:46.310> ugly<00:04:47.310> spots<00:04:48.150> on

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:48.330 
and they can cover up some ugly spots on

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:50.600 
and they can cover up some ugly spots on
the<00:04:48.390> table<00:04:48.840> and<00:04:49.050> give<00:04:49.860> your<00:04:50.040> table<00:04:50.190> some<00:04:50.460> more

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:50.610 
the table and give your table some more

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:54.680 
the table and give your table some more
three<00:04:51.240> dimension<00:04:51.660> to<00:04:51.870> it<00:04:51.990> and<00:04:53.540> so<00:04:54.540> we<00:04:54.570> have
