00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
on and basically sanded down only where

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:33.020

the grip tape was going to go came out
really<00:00:33.480> nice<00:00:33.719> i<00:00:34.219> fattened<00:00:35.219> up<00:00:35.430> the<00:00:35.489> actual

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
really nice i fattened up the actual

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.310 
really nice i fattened up the actual
design<00:00:36.480> just<00:00:36.780> so<00:00:37.190> for<00:00:38.190> wear<00:00:39.120> and<00:00:39.270> tear<00:00:39.540> because

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
design just so for wear and tear because

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.380 
design just so for wear and tear because
now<00:00:40.590> the<00:00:40.649> small<00:00:40.950> pieces<00:00:41.160> usually<00:00:41.820> break<00:00:42.090> or

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
now the small pieces usually break or

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.750 
now the small pieces usually break or
but<00:00:42.719> you<00:00:43.200> shouldn't<00:00:43.440> be<00:00:43.530> pretty<00:00:43.800> good<00:00:43.980> then

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
but you shouldn't be pretty good then

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.869 
but you shouldn't be pretty good then
what<00:00:44.940> i<00:00:44.969> did<00:00:45.239> is<00:00:45.450> set<00:00:46.379> it<00:00:46.500> down<00:00:46.620> sides<00:00:47.039> and<00:00:48.379> with

00:00:49.869 --> 00:00:49.879 
what i did is set it down sides and with

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:53.779 
what i did is set it down sides and with
black<00:00:50.879> satin<00:00:51.480> finish<00:00:51.750> paint<00:00:52.050> I<00:00:52.640> continued<00:00:53.640> on

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
black satin finish paint I continued on

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:57.350 
black satin finish paint I continued on
the<00:00:55.070> pattern<00:00:56.070> so<00:00:56.640> it<00:00:56.730> gives<00:00:56.850> us<00:00:57.030> some<00:00:57.210> more

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
the pattern so it gives us some more

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.200 
the pattern so it gives us some more
depth<00:00:57.989> it<00:00:58.770> looks<00:00:58.980> really<00:00:59.399> like<00:00:59.699> factory

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
depth it looks really like factory

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:08.289 
depth it looks really like factory
finish<00:01:00.390> almost<00:01:00.870> then<00:01:01.800> I<00:01:01.829> used<00:01:02.370> a<00:01:05.990> marine<00:01:06.990> poly

00:01:08.289 --> 00:01:08.299 
finish almost then I used a marine poly

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:14.270 
finish almost then I used a marine poly
which<00:01:09.299> is<00:01:10.760> spar<00:01:11.760> varnish<00:01:12.200> exterior<00:01:13.280> very

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
which is spar varnish exterior very

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.450 
which is spar varnish exterior very
durable<00:01:15.020> it<00:01:16.020> gives<00:01:16.229> it<00:01:16.320> a<00:01:16.380> nice<00:01:16.530> gloss<00:01:16.979> finish

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
durable it gives it a nice gloss finish

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:25.160 
durable it gives it a nice gloss finish
on<00:01:19.850> the<00:01:20.850> edges<00:01:22.009> okay<00:01:23.009> and<00:01:23.369> once<00:01:23.580> it<00:01:23.759> dries<00:01:24.170> you

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
on the edges okay and once it dries you

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.440 
on the edges okay and once it dries you
basically<00:01:25.500> get<00:01:25.680> some<00:01:25.830> steel<00:01:26.009> wool<00:01:26.040> and<00:01:26.490> wipe

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450
