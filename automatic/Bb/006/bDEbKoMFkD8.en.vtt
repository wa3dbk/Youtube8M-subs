 [Music] 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:37.739
 [Applause] 

00:00:35.269 --> 00:00:39.570
 as you start by going up here 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.699
 we have a side vertex pulls 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.309
 now done on the left side though 

00:00:41.699 --> 00:00:46.860
 could do as he wanted and now 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.750
 you are on to a French plait 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.549
 weave 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:57.890
 you take a little up here 

00:00:50.549 --> 00:00:57.890
 party harvard divides the into three strands 

00:00:58.729 --> 00:01:03.689
 and now she is like 

00:01:00.869 --> 00:01:06.500
 French pigtail the outer strand 

00:01:03.689 --> 00:01:06.500
 goes over the middle 

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:12.390
 if you're up here at the first 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:19.220
 again, you are going to take yourselves 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:22.470
 a few hairs to express streak about it 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:24.360
 it's back to middle now 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.920
 Do you usually go to the under 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.530
 and also severe hair again 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.990
 but take at half the French 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:33.180
 Braid simply plait animal 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.850
 the lower strand without hair too 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:39.360
 So take that and put it back 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:42.620
 over the middle now you take yourselves 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.620
 again a few hairs to it 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:53.820
 to your upper strand puts over the 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:58.170
 middle and bottom you just do it 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:02:00.410
 not but keeps expecting now goes 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:05.340
 your home village so a bit weird 

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:07.200
 down so we shine up here 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.960
 this always takes a bit 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:14.640
 it falls that the braid that he so 

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:18.000
 a bit down here runs above have 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:21.290
 I have hair again and take 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.290
 I have no hair now 

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:36.579
 [Music] 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:41.530
 we just come down there completely normal 

00:02:36.579 --> 00:02:43.829
 continue to braid 1 may do me 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:43.829
 still 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:58.560
 [Music] 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:03:01.910
 and then her new zoff just falls 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:01.910
 down to the bottom 

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:16.870
 Now you can have your hair here again 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:20.500
 So a bit braid a bit 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:25.120
 then pull apart then sees the whole 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:27.820
 made a bit thicker to do that 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:31.960
 We then build here under lichen 

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:33.880
 he thinks that's exactly how you can 

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:35.320
 but also to conclude but if you 

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:37.480
 not yet braided so far down 

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:39.960
 then let them be even easier 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:45.800
 pull apart 

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:45.800
 [Music] 

00:03:54.300 --> 00:04:07.620

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:23.850
 could suit the hair color 

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:23.850
 pull apart a bit 

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:38.490
