00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
major bar chord you can see how this

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:20.179 
major bar chord you can see how this
shape<00:01:14.700> here<00:01:15.090> is<00:01:15.299> the<00:01:16.020> same<00:01:16.320> as<00:01:16.560> an<00:01:16.680> e<00:01:17.009> shape<00:01:19.189> but

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
shape here is the same as an e shape but

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.130 
shape here is the same as an e shape but
to<00:01:20.369> accommodate<00:01:20.909> for<00:01:21.090> those<00:01:21.210> open<00:01:21.600> strings<00:01:21.960> I

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
to accommodate for those open strings I

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.440 
to accommodate for those open strings I
have<00:01:22.290> to<00:01:22.439> create<00:01:22.710> a<00:01:22.799> bar<00:01:23.130> here<00:01:23.580> now<00:01:24.090> the<00:01:24.150> name

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
have to create a bar here now the name

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.270 
have to create a bar here now the name
of<00:01:24.630> the<00:01:24.720> cord<00:01:25.020> is<00:01:25.290> determined<00:01:25.770> by<00:01:25.890> where<00:01:26.100> ever

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
of the cord is determined by where ever

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.160 
of the cord is determined by where ever
my<00:01:26.310> first<00:01:26.700> finger<00:01:26.970> is<00:01:27.240> on<00:01:27.270> that<00:01:27.600> low<00:01:27.840> E<00:01:28.140> string

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
my first finger is on that low E string

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.370 
my first finger is on that low E string
so<00:01:28.920> this<00:01:29.070> would<00:01:29.250> be<00:01:29.400> an<00:01:29.610> F<00:01:29.880> major<00:01:30.210> chord<00:01:30.450> this

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
so this would be an F major chord this

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.609 
so this would be an F major chord this
would<00:01:31.530> be<00:01:31.560> a<00:01:31.710> G<00:01:32.009> major<00:01:32.310> chord<00:01:32.490> and<00:01:33.360> so<00:01:33.689> on<00:01:33.869> now

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
would be a G major chord and so on now

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.950 
would be a G major chord and so on now
here<00:01:34.860> is<00:01:34.979> an<00:01:35.100> E<00:01:35.340> minor<00:01:35.610> chord<00:01:36.030> and<00:01:36.659> open

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
here is an E minor chord and open

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.320 
here is an E minor chord and open
position

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:38.330 
position

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:40.330 
position
and<00:01:38.480> if<00:01:38.810> I<00:01:38.930> move<00:01:39.200> each<00:01:39.410> one<00:01:39.680> of<00:01:39.710> these<00:01:39.920> fingers

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:40.340 
and if I move each one of these fingers

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:43.180 
and if I move each one of these fingers
up<00:01:40.610> or<00:01:40.820> each<00:01:40.970> notes<00:01:41.450> up<00:01:41.690> one<00:01:41.990> fret<00:01:42.290> then<00:01:42.860> I<00:01:42.920> end

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:43.190 
up or each notes up one fret then I end

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:46.690
