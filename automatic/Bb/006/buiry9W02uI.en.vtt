00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:08.870
 That's it folks but I'm not going now with 

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:15.059
 ov 

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:18.449
 222 interest of 6 axis what we see 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:21.270
 very well, a lot of 1959 flight video, right? 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:24.240
 so we'll see today the difference is 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:26.849
 So just stability and let's try 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:34.170
 do something nice with the 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:36.660
 rock band bon jovi guide battery 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:44.280
 in the correct frame 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:47.280
 the control is antenna signal ok on the spout 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:53.969
 let entering the vertical're the 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:55.530
 buyer's signal and is not directed 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:01:01.260
 man to direct so let's go 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:03.989
 try to make a good goal put there 80 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:08.220
 the pair an important tip also people 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:12.619
 put some time here to monitor 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.619
 the battery what we go there 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:23.500
 it's now 18 11 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:29.370
 I'll put 1817 to leave your little ones 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:29.370
 There we have no risk of 1818 going. 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:36.160
 point six of the type of flight have a risk of 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:44.590
 miss if I want, come on 

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:49.440
 very stable staff 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:49.440
 ok a dream 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:16.420
 You realize that he almost falls 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:21.310
 but it does not topple his father's right to 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:22.900
 created close I did here I 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:25.180
 I'm more or less 1100 meters is 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:30.270
 staff one block look at that thing 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:35.020
 what if quadricopter does to the 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:37.980
 diving and the curve 

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:43.530
 all thanks to the six sacks spin is 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:43.530
 What do you like beautiful? 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:57.730
 remembering that a quadricopter says 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:59.770
 advice goes with the reasonable wind of 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:03.760
 people he cuts the cool wind 

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:11.170
 It's far enough now to twist to 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:13.000
 Can I get him? 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:15.280
 I'm going down a little bit but he can 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:20.680
 try the loops here certain philips 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:22.980
 idowu ok let's go that who flies like 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:27.840
 to fly away does not like to send an album 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:27.840
 there happening here with him 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:51.269
 it's not really that much fun 

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:51.269
 I want to have my big toe 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:57.579
 he has enough instability then 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:01.450
 I hope you were not on the camera. 

00:03:57.579 --> 00:04:03.239
 receiving there that 144 actually hangs in the 

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:07.239
 air 

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:14.920
 Come on, I'll bring it to the attack. 

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:19.060
 try a correct flip ok its different 

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:21.609
 for me now a contrary novelty 

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:25.380
 good, just pay the flip 5 is showing 

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:25.380
 for you that I found puts in 100% 

00:04:26.759 --> 00:04:33.639
 hi, how are you? 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:35.470
 sunday sunday sunday is not the jewel 

00:04:33.639 --> 00:04:39.639
 only the recording I finished here 

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:41.020
 I'll tell you the glasses in here. 

00:04:39.639 --> 00:04:44.199
 So, next business folks 

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:51.130
 I put in 100% like the whole year by 

00:04:44.199 --> 00:04:57.070
 front will take care of flip rock like it 

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:59.949
 to have jumped from the flip almost but stabilized 

00:04:57.070 --> 00:05:01.990
 this is the turn 6 that allows people 

00:04:59.949 --> 00:05:05.650
 make this move without major 

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:08.409
 sacrifices, I'm going to pose now and the 

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:09.940
 next adventures and back we can 

00:05:08.409 --> 00:05:12.479
 you on youtube ok 

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:12.479
 a hug 

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:24.830
 I am a person the tip here is the following 

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:27.870
 It is always necessary to call the first table what 

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:30.780
 always turns off the quadricopter frame 

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:31.950
 first plane was the model after the 

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:35.120
 content 

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:35.120
 a hug
