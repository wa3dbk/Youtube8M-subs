getting a better transition from the big

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:06.579 
getting a better transition from the big
stories<00:00:04.560> to<00:00:04.799> the<00:00:04.920> fine<00:00:05.160> sand<00:00:05.490> by<00:00:05.790> using<00:00:05.970> a

00:00:06.579 --> 00:00:06.589 
stories to the fine sand by using a

00:00:06.589 --> 00:00:11.120 
stories to the fine sand by using a
little<00:00:07.589> bit<00:00:08.330> smaller<00:00:09.330> cradle<00:00:09.830> makes<00:00:10.830> an<00:00:11.010> a

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130 
little bit smaller cradle makes an a

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:14.240 
little bit smaller cradle makes an a
little<00:00:11.490> bit<00:00:11.580> nature<00:00:11.910> would<00:00:12.469> put<00:00:13.469> some<00:00:13.740> of<00:00:14.009> the

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
little bit nature would put some of the

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:19.250 
little bit nature would put some of the
add<00:00:15.150> of<00:00:16.020> this<00:00:16.859> forest<00:00:17.250> scent<00:00:17.580> inside<00:00:18.270> on<00:00:18.570> the

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
add of this forest scent inside on the

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.250 
add of this forest scent inside on the
border<00:00:19.619> line<00:00:20.189> of<00:00:20.490> the<00:00:20.699> soil<00:00:21.240> and<00:00:21.420> of<00:00:21.630> the<00:00:21.840> sand

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
border line of the soil and of the sand

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:27.830 
border line of the soil and of the sand
so<00:00:23.130> to<00:00:23.910> give<00:00:24.119> them<00:00:24.330> first<00:00:25.260> to<00:00:25.470> avoid<00:00:25.820> that<00:00:26.840> is

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
so to give them first to avoid that is

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.189 
so to give them first to avoid that is
the<00:00:28.650> mix<00:00:28.890> between<00:00:29.250> the<00:00:29.880> sand<00:00:30.300> and<00:00:30.480> the<00:00:30.630> soil<00:00:30.990> is

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
the mix between the sand and the soil is

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:35.600 
the mix between the sand and the soil is
too<00:00:31.380> extreme<00:00:31.769> and<00:00:32.300> second<00:00:33.300> is<00:00:33.809> if<00:00:34.550> the<00:00:35.550> only

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
too extreme and second is if the only

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.720 
too extreme and second is if the only
the<00:00:36.239> whole<00:00:36.510> layout<00:00:36.719> a<00:00:36.930> little<00:00:37.350> bit<00:00:37.469> more

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:37.730 
the whole layout a little bit more

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:41.479 
the whole layout a little bit more
natural<00:00:38.730> touch<00:00:39.390> so<00:00:40.290> you<00:00:40.620> can<00:00:40.860> imagine<00:00:41.040> that<00:00:41.309> is

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
natural touch so you can imagine that is

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:46.400 
natural touch so you can imagine that is
a<00:00:41.520> big<00:00:42.059> stone<00:00:42.329> between<00:00:44.360> small<00:00:45.360> send<00:00:45.899> all<00:00:46.200> these

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
a big stone between small send all these

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:51.830 
a big stone between small send all these
must<00:00:47.160> be<00:00:48.170> the<00:00:49.170> sea<00:00:49.350> side<00:00:50.239> this<00:00:51.239> is<00:00:51.300> the<00:00:51.480> sea

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
must be the sea side this is the sea

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.670 
must be the sea side this is the sea
side<00:00:52.140> and<00:00:52.559> this<00:00:52.680> is<00:00:52.829> the<00:00:52.949> coastline<00:00:53.550> so<00:00:53.969> now<00:00:54.840> we

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
side and this is the coastline so now we

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.549 
side and this is the coastline so now we
start<00:00:55.739> to<00:00:56.160> plant<00:00:56.430> the<00:00:56.670> tank<00:00:56.969> and<00:00:57.410> like<00:00:58.410> I

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
start to plant the tank and like I

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.260 
start to plant the tank and like I
explained<00:00:58.980> it<00:00:59.160> at<00:00:59.370> the<00:00:59.579> beginning<00:00:59.940> I<00:01:00.059> only

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
explained it at the beginning I only

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:06.670 
explained it at the beginning I only
choose<00:01:00.629> normally<00:01:01.399> very<00:01:02.399> you<00:01:02.579> let<00:01:03.270> plants<00:01:04.519> add

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:06.680 
choose normally very you let plants add

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:10.700 
choose normally very you let plants add
between<00:01:07.680> four<00:01:08.040> and<00:01:08.070> five<00:01:08.270> swords<00:01:09.330> I<00:01:09.710> decided

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
between four and five swords I decided

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.420 
between four and five swords I decided
later<00:01:11.070> how<00:01:11.280> much<00:01:11.490> really<00:01:12.000> so<00:01:12.830> the<00:01:13.830> first<00:01:14.130> thing

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
later how much really so the first thing

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:20.120 
later how much really so the first thing
I<00:01:14.670> want<00:01:15.090> to<00:01:15.240> show<00:01:15.570> is<00:01:16.850> richer<00:01:17.850> three<00:01:18.689> tons<00:01:19.130> you

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
I want to show is richer three tons you

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.670 
I want to show is richer three tons you
know<00:01:20.280> richer<00:01:21.320> the<00:01:22.320> normally<00:01:23.310> floating<00:01:23.850> plant

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:24.680 
know richer the normally floating plant

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:27.380 
know richer the normally floating plant
thanks<00:01:25.680> to<00:01:25.799> mr.<00:01:25.950> Mallory<00:01:26.430> was<00:01:26.729> the<00:01:26.880> first<00:01:27.150> who

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
thanks to mr. Mallory was the first who

thanks to mr. Mallory was the first who
can<00:01:28.520> we<00:01:29.520> have<00:01:29.640> the<00:01:29.820> idea<00:01:30.150> to<00:01:30.840> put<00:01:31.079> this

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:31.700 
can we have the idea to put this

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:35.780 
can we have the idea to put this
floating<00:01:32.700> plant<00:01:33.590> underwater<00:01:34.590> and<00:01:34.920> make<00:01:35.640> it

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
floating plant underwater and make it

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.910 
floating plant underwater and make it
available<00:01:35.939> to<00:01:36.390> blend<00:01:36.780> add<00:01:37.140> to<00:01:37.500> to<00:01:37.710> grow

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
available to blend add to to grow

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.880 
available to blend add to to grow
underwater<00:01:38.689> we<00:01:39.689> have<00:01:39.869> used<00:01:40.110> yesterday<00:01:40.380> reach

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
underwater we have used yesterday reach

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.719 
underwater we have used yesterday reach
a<00:01:41.070> line<00:01:41.250> a<00:01:42.380> slide<00:01:43.380> I<00:01:43.619> show<00:01:43.829> it<00:01:44.009> with<00:01:44.220> a<00:01:44.250> most

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
a line a slide I show it with a most

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:47.630 
a line a slide I show it with a most
middle<00:01:45.270> most<00:01:45.390> line<00:01:45.659> but<00:01:46.320> for<00:01:46.920> mature<00:01:47.280> I<00:01:47.460> will

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
middle most line but for mature I will

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.899 
middle most line but for mature I will
prefer<00:01:47.880> when<00:01:48.390> you<00:01:48.509> when<00:01:48.840> you<00:01:48.960> take<00:01:49.170> a<00:01:49.909> richer

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
prefer when you when you take a richer

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:54.109 
prefer when you when you take a richer
line<00:01:51.090> or<00:01:51.240> a<00:01:51.930> very<00:01:52.200> tiny<00:01:52.740> fishing<00:01:53.189> line<00:01:53.369> because

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
line or a very tiny fishing line because

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.749 
line or a very tiny fishing line because
a<00:01:54.329> richer<00:01:54.689> is<00:01:54.810> not<00:01:54.990> possible<00:01:55.409> to<00:01:55.590> attach<00:01:56.520> to

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
a richer is not possible to attach to

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:59.840 
a richer is not possible to attach to
the<00:01:56.880> stone<00:01:57.119> so<00:01:57.719> you<00:01:57.780> have<00:01:58.140> to<00:01:58.380> be<00:01:58.610> keep<00:01:59.610> them

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
the stone so you have to be keep them

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:00.499 
the stone so you have to be keep them
underwater

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:16.490 
put them on the stove and then I take

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:19.510 
put them on the stove and then I take
the<00:02:16.670> route<00:02:17.020> the<00:02:18.020> line<00:02:18.200> normally<00:02:18.860> please

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:19.520 
the route the line normally please

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:21.520 
the route the line normally please
remember<00:02:19.850> fishing<00:02:20.600> line<00:02:20.810> or<00:02:21.050> reach<00:02:21.200> a<00:02:21.350> line

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:21.530 
remember fishing line or reach a line

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:25.750

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:51.830 
was a two different kind of soil test

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:55.290 
was a two different kind of soil test
the<00:02:52.220> best<00:02:52.430> is<00:02:52.640> when<00:02:52.850> you<00:02:53.000> have<00:02:53.150> squared<00:02:53.980> stones

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:55.300 
the best is when you have squared stones

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:59.040 
the best is when you have squared stones
we<00:02:56.300> can<00:02:56.510> make<00:02:57.050> it<00:02:57.200> like<00:02:57.380> a<00:02:57.410> chest<00:02:57.740> filled<00:02:57.950> up

00:02:59.040 --> 00:02:59.050 
we can make it like a chest filled up

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:04.240 
we can make it like a chest filled up
sometimes<00:03:00.050> it's<00:03:01.040> also<00:03:01.300> wrong<00:03:03.010> the<00:03:04.010> most

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:04.250 
sometimes it's also wrong the most

sometimes it's also wrong the most

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:06.260 
important when you use richer is the

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:11.140 
important when you use richer is the
maintenance<00:03:06.860> as<00:03:07.990> you<00:03:08.990> can<00:03:09.490> have<00:03:10.490> richer

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:11.150

problem<00:03:14.060> but<00:03:14.810> this<00:03:15.260> is<00:03:15.440> very<00:03:15.650> dangerous

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:15.920 
problem but this is very dangerous

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:20.140

that's<00:03:29.989> the<00:03:30.380> problem<00:03:30.620> sometimes<00:03:31.370> we<00:03:31.760> have<00:03:31.880> to

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:32.000 
that's the problem sometimes we have to

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.420 
that's the problem sometimes we have to
cut<00:03:32.209> them<00:03:32.420> at<00:03:33.290> least<00:03:33.590> every<00:03:33.920> two<00:03:34.190> weeks

between<00:05:52.010> the<00:05:52.400> richer<00:05:52.760> stones<00:05:53.560> so<00:05:54.560> now<00:05:54.860> it's

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:55.130 
between the richer stones so now it's

00:05:55.130 --> 00:06:02.530 
between the richer stones so now it's

there with the roots keep the richer
also<00:06:08.890> down<00:06:09.890> now<00:06:10.610> this<00:06:10.790> is<00:06:10.940> a<00:06:11.020> synergy

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:12.250 
also down now this is a synergy

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:16.480 
also down now this is a synergy
something<00:06:13.250> else<00:06:13.430> effect<00:06:14.830> so<00:06:15.830> then<00:06:16.100> I<00:06:16.130> have

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:16.490 
something else effect so then I have

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:21.310 
something else effect so then I have
here<00:06:16.700> some<00:06:16.940> help<00:06:17.810> repair<00:06:18.460> some<00:06:19.460> of<00:06:19.490> the<00:06:20.320> area

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:21.320 
here some help repair some of the area

I<00:06:28.900> blend<00:06:29.900> it<00:06:30.020> more<00:06:30.170> behind<00:06:30.470> and<00:06:30.740> the<00:06:30.860> others<00:06:31.430> in

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:32.120 
I blend it more behind and the others in

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:34.969 
I blend it more behind and the others in
front<00:06:32.450> so<00:06:32.630> we<00:06:32.810> getting<00:06:33.169> more

00:06:34.969 --> 00:06:34.979 
front so we getting more

have<00:06:38.020> the<00:06:38.380> same<00:06:38.590> plan<00:06:38.889> in<00:06:39.100> a<00:06:39.250> small<00:06:39.520> version<00:06:39.699> in

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:39.970 
have the same plan in a small version in

00:06:39.970 --> 00:06:43.020 
have the same plan in a small version in
front<00:06:40.360> and<00:06:40.570> the<00:06:40.900> big<00:06:41.080> behind<00:06:41.590> looks<00:06:42.310> much<00:06:42.520> by<00:06:42.699> I

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:43.030 
front and the big behind looks much by I

00:06:43.030 --> 00:06:46.439 
front and the big behind looks much by I
can't<00:06:43.300> do<00:06:43.419> this<00:06:43.600> like<00:06:43.840> this<00:06:44.050> but<00:06:44.889> it's<00:06:45.449> stupid

00:06:46.439 --> 00:06:46.449 
can't do this like this but it's stupid

00:06:46.449 --> 00:06:51.439 
can't do this like this but it's stupid
huh<00:06:47.310> so<00:06:48.310> there's<00:06:48.880> more<00:06:49.090> one<00:06:49.330> in<00:06:49.870> front<00:06:50.169> so<00:06:50.350> I

00:06:51.439 --> 00:06:51.449 
huh so there's more one in front so I

00:06:51.449 --> 00:07:00.629 
huh so there's more one in front so I
put<00:06:52.449> some<00:06:53.100> so<00:06:54.100> it's<00:06:54.400> Ken<00:06:59.009> after<00:07:00.009> every<00:07:00.310> player

00:07:00.629 --> 00:07:00.639 
put some so it's Ken after every player

00:07:00.639 --> 00:07:06.990 
put some so it's Ken after every player
you<00:07:01.120> have<00:07:01.270> to<00:07:01.419> spray<00:07:01.660> a<00:07:01.690> little<00:07:02.050> bit<00:07:05.100> it's<00:07:06.100> it's

00:07:06.990 --> 00:07:07.000 
you have to spray a little bit it's it's

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.779 
you have to spray a little bit it's it's
fact<00:07:07.810> comes<00:07:08.139> without<00:07:08.440> saying<00:07:08.710> that<00:07:09.099> you<00:07:09.610> have

00:07:09.779 --> 00:07:09.789 
fact comes without saying that you have

00:07:09.789 --> 00:07:13.020 
fact comes without saying that you have
is<00:07:10.000> you<00:07:10.150> have<00:07:10.180> more<00:07:10.900> material<00:07:11.139> yes<00:07:11.949> it's<00:07:12.789> much

00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:13.030 
is you have more material yes it's much

00:07:13.030 --> 00:07:14.879 
is you have more material yes it's much
more<00:07:13.270> easier<00:07:13.630> than<00:07:13.870> you<00:07:13.990> have<00:07:14.110> only<00:07:14.440> two<00:07:14.650> pots

00:07:14.879 --> 00:07:14.889 
more easier than you have only two pots

00:07:14.889 --> 00:07:18.270 
more easier than you have only two pots
and<00:07:16.169> because<00:07:17.169> the<00:07:17.380> whole<00:07:17.530> system<00:07:17.979> is<00:07:18.039> much

00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:21.570 
and because the whole system is much
more<00:07:18.520> stable<00:07:18.759> and<00:07:19.210> the<00:07:20.050> plants<00:07:20.500> go<00:07:20.740> talk<00:07:21.340> to<00:07:21.370> my

00:07:21.570 --> 00:07:21.580 
more stable and the plants go talk to my

a<00:07:32.470> little<00:07:33.470> bit<00:07:34.570> and<00:07:36.400> you<00:07:37.400> don't<00:07:37.430> have<00:07:37.789> to<00:07:37.970> scare

00:07:38.230 --> 00:07:38.240 
a little bit and you don't have to scare

00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:45.730 
a little bit and you don't have to scare
about<00:07:38.680> the<00:07:39.680> ink<00:07:39.889> from<00:07:40.580> the<00:07:40.759> newspaper<00:07:44.470> so<00:07:45.470> and

about the ink from the newspaper so and
at<00:07:46.280> the<00:07:46.490> end<00:07:48.039> we<00:07:49.039> have<00:07:49.160> a<00:07:50.320> nice<00:07:51.320> tropical

I<00:07:54.370> used<00:07:55.370> it<00:07:55.550> every<00:07:56.060> time<00:07:56.210> put<00:07:56.840> limits<00:07:59.470> put<00:08:00.470> in

00:08:01.350 --> 00:08:01.360 
I used it every time put limits put in

00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:06.789 
I used it every time put limits put in
