okay welcome back to fighting robots now
in<00:00:10.019> the<00:00:10.110> final<00:00:10.440> stage<00:00:10.650> of<00:00:10.860> this<00:00:10.980> concept<00:00:12.230> now

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
in the final stage of this concept now

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:14.870 
in the final stage of this concept now
we're<00:00:13.380> gonna<00:00:13.469> be<00:00:13.620> fleshing<00:00:14.040> out<00:00:14.130> all<00:00:14.370> the

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
we're gonna be fleshing out all the

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.390 
we're gonna be fleshing out all the
particulars<00:00:15.269> with<00:00:15.509> this<00:00:15.660> concept<00:00:16.170> here<00:00:16.379> as<00:00:16.590> if

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
particulars with this concept here as if

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:18.859 
particulars with this concept here as if
we're<00:00:17.550> going<00:00:17.580> to<00:00:17.730> show<00:00:17.940> it<00:00:18.090> to<00:00:18.180> a<00:00:18.210> client<00:00:18.690> maybe

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
we're going to show it to a client maybe

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:22.670 
we're going to show it to a client maybe
you<00:00:19.260> know<00:00:20.750> and<00:00:21.750> now<00:00:21.900> I'm<00:00:21.990> going<00:00:22.140> to<00:00:22.199> start<00:00:22.470> just

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
you know and now I'm going to start just

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.839 
you know and now I'm going to start just
fleshing<00:00:23.100> out<00:00:23.250> the<00:00:23.310> basic<00:00:23.820> pose<00:00:24.029> of<00:00:24.240> the<00:00:24.269> hero

got<00:00:26.509> the<00:00:26.660> actual<00:00:26.990> concept<00:00:27.499> in<00:00:27.650> the<00:00:27.710> bottom

00:00:27.999 --> 00:00:28.009 
got the actual concept in the bottom

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:29.439 
got the actual concept in the bottom
left<00:00:28.250> hand<00:00:28.400> corner<00:00:28.550> I'm<00:00:28.849> going<00:00:29.029> to<00:00:29.119> copy<00:00:29.329> that

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:29.449 
left hand corner I'm going to copy that

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:31.179 
left hand corner I'm going to copy that
a<00:00:29.599> little<00:00:29.869> bit<00:00:30.050> maybe<00:00:30.560> make<00:00:30.769> a<00:00:30.800> little<00:00:31.009> bit

00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:31.189 
a little bit maybe make a little bit

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:34.970 
a little bit maybe make a little bit
more<00:00:31.339> changes<00:00:31.789> to<00:00:31.910> it

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:42.470 

you

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.630 

SketchUp<00:00:43.480> the<00:00:43.870> head<00:00:44.109> and<00:00:44.379> torso<00:00:44.769> real<00:00:45.309> quick

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:45.640 
SketchUp the head and torso real quick

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:46.889 
SketchUp the head and torso real quick
and<00:00:45.850> make<00:00:45.969> sure<00:00:46.149> everything<00:00:46.570> is<00:00:46.600> kind<00:00:46.839> of

00:00:46.889 --> 00:00:46.899 
and make sure everything is kind of

00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:48.450 
and make sure everything is kind of
checking<00:00:47.229> up<00:00:47.379> of<00:00:47.559> what<00:00:47.739> the<00:00:47.859> concert<00:00:48.280> had

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:48.460 
checking up of what the concert had

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:51.840 
checking up of what the concert had
there<00:00:48.699> I<00:00:49.679> might<00:00:50.679> make<00:00:50.920> this<00:00:51.129> a<00:00:51.190> little<00:00:51.670> more

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:51.850 
there I might make this a little more

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:54.960 
there I might make this a little more
simple

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:54.970 

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:57.040 

and<00:00:55.970> you<00:00:56.090> could<00:00:56.270> make<00:00:56.420> sure<00:00:56.450> that<00:00:56.720> everything

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:57.050 
and you could make sure that everything

00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:58.600 
and you could make sure that everything
is<00:00:57.140> just<00:00:57.230> really<00:00:57.500> clean<00:00:57.740> that<00:00:57.980> it<00:00:58.160> feels<00:00:58.370> going

00:00:58.600 --> 00:00:58.610 
is just really clean that it feels going

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:00.490 
is just really clean that it feels going
to<00:00:58.850> a<00:00:58.880> 3d<00:00:59.300> modeller<00:00:59.720> I<00:00:59.780> want<00:01:00.260> to<00:01:00.320> make<00:01:00.470> sure

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:00.500 
to a 3d modeller I want to make sure

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.200 
to a 3d modeller I want to make sure
that<00:01:00.770> he's<00:01:00.950> able<00:01:01.070> to<00:01:01.340> model<00:01:01.640> this<00:01:01.760> character

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:02.210 
that he's able to model this character

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:04.930 
that he's able to model this character
very<00:01:02.240> simple<00:01:03.160> about<00:01:04.160> a<00:01:04.190> lot<00:01:04.400> of<00:01:04.520> problems

so<00:02:47.840> it's<00:02:48.020> really<00:02:48.200> quick<00:02:48.380> easy<00:02:48.650> to<00:02:48.830> change<00:02:49.250> the

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:49.370 
so it's really quick easy to change the

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:51.760 
so it's really quick easy to change the
color<00:02:49.610> of<00:02:49.910> the<00:02:50.240> uptick<00:02:50.750> of<00:02:50.930> the<00:02:51.080> color<00:02:51.290> layer

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:51.770 
color of the uptick of the color layer

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:54.970 
color of the uptick of the color layer
will<00:02:52.280> happen<00:02:52.610> to<00:02:53.110> work<00:02:54.110> on<00:02:54.320> the<00:02:54.560> actual

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:54.980 
will happen to work on the actual

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:58.510 
will happen to work on the actual
overlay<00:02:55.550> or<00:02:55.820> your<00:02:56.360> actual<00:02:56.630> highlights<00:02:57.520> your

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:04.520 

it's<00:03:03.209> totally<00:03:03.540> separate<00:03:03.959> so<00:03:04.110> you<00:03:04.200> can<00:03:04.319> change

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
it's totally separate so you can change

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:07.260 
it's totally separate so you can change
the<00:03:04.620> coming<00:03:04.860> time<00:03:05.040> you<00:03:05.159> want
