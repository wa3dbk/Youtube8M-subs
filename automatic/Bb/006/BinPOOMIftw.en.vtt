first<00:00:35.660> thing<00:00:35.809> that<00:00:35.930> stands<00:00:36.140> out<00:00:36.320> to<00:00:36.500> me<00:00:36.579> when<00:00:37.579> I

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:37.640 
first thing that stands out to me when I

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:39.220 
first thing that stands out to me when I
turned<00:00:37.940> the<00:00:38.210> back<00:00:38.360> of<00:00:38.510> this<00:00:38.570> card<00:00:38.809> over<00:00:39.050> is

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:39.230 
turned the back of this card over is

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:42.220 
turned the back of this card over is
that<00:00:39.260> throw<00:00:39.649> power<00:00:40.329> he's<00:00:41.329> really<00:00:41.540> low<00:00:41.840> but<00:00:42.140> it

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:42.230 
that throw power he's really low but it

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:43.410 
that throw power he's really low but it
feels<00:00:42.380> like<00:00:42.620> it<00:00:42.739> should<00:00:42.860> be<00:00:42.890> a<00:00:42.980> lot<00:00:43.219> higher

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:43.420 
feels like it should be a lot higher

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:45.700 
feels like it should be a lot higher
when<00:00:44.420> you<00:00:44.510> get<00:00:44.660> this<00:00:44.780> card<00:00:45.050> don't<00:00:45.350> be<00:00:45.469> scared

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:45.710 
when you get this card don't be scared

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:46.930 
when you get this card don't be scared
to<00:00:45.800> purchase<00:00:46.129> it<00:00:46.280> because<00:00:46.489> of<00:00:46.610> that<00:00:46.730> throw

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:46.940 
to purchase it because of that throw

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:49.410 
to purchase it because of that throw
power<00:00:47.180> he<00:00:48.050> throws<00:00:48.290> a<00:00:48.320> lot<00:00:48.559> stronger<00:00:48.860> than<00:00:49.010> that

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:49.420 
power he throws a lot stronger than that

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:52.389 
power he throws a lot stronger than that
but<00:00:50.420> what's<00:00:50.899> really<00:00:51.170> odd<00:00:51.440> is<00:00:51.800> that<00:00:51.829> his<00:00:52.190> throat

00:00:52.389 --> 00:00:52.399 
but what's really odd is that his throat

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:55.119 
but what's really odd is that his throat
deep<00:00:52.579> he<00:00:52.789> need<00:00:52.940> a<00:00:52.969> lot<00:00:53.180> of<00:00:53.210> power<00:00:53.450> for<00:00:53.690> that<00:00:54.129> but

00:00:55.119 --> 00:00:55.129 
deep he need a lot of power for that but

00:00:55.129 --> 00:00:57.369 
deep he need a lot of power for that but
it's<00:00:55.579> so<00:00:55.760> deep<00:00:55.969> is<00:00:56.090> 95<00:00:56.539> when<00:00:56.719> he<00:00:56.809> stole<00:00:57.020> powers

00:00:57.369 --> 00:00:57.379 
it's so deep is 95 when he stole powers

00:00:57.379 --> 00:00:59.470 
it's so deep is 95 when he stole powers
85<00:00:57.829> doesn't<00:00:58.399> make<00:00:58.520> really<00:00:58.820> much<00:00:59.000> sense<00:00:59.239> and

00:00:59.470 --> 00:00:59.480 
85 doesn't make really much sense and

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:01.720 
85 doesn't make really much sense and
that<00:00:59.680> speed<00:01:00.680> you<00:01:01.039> will<00:01:01.129> see<00:01:01.340> later<00:01:01.460> in<00:01:01.699> this

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:01.730 
that speed you will see later in this

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:04.090 
that speed you will see later in this
video<00:01:01.879> that<00:01:02.210> it's<00:01:02.420> a<00:01:02.510> lot<00:01:02.629> faster<00:01:02.840> than<00:01:03.260> 77

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:04.100 
video that it's a lot faster than 77

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:07.749 
video that it's a lot faster than 77
it's<00:01:04.220> like<00:01:04.339> an<00:01:04.430> 82<00:01:04.940> and<00:01:05.509> 83<00:01:06.100> and<00:01:07.100> he<00:01:07.280> does<00:01:07.460> break

00:01:07.749 --> 00:01:07.759 
it's like an 82 and 83 and he does break

00:01:07.759 --> 00:01:09.340 
it's like an 82 and 83 and he does break
a<00:01:07.789> little<00:01:08.060> bit<00:01:08.210> of<00:01:08.300> tackles<00:01:08.750> I<00:01:08.869> didn't<00:01:09.140> get

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:09.350 
a little bit of tackles I didn't get

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:11.289 
a little bit of tackles I didn't get
your<00:01:09.530> game<00:01:09.710> player<00:01:09.950> and<00:01:10.369> he<00:01:10.939> doesn't<00:01:11.210> really

00:01:11.289 --> 00:01:11.299 
your game player and he doesn't really

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:23.679 
your game player and he doesn't really
get<00:01:11.510> injured<00:01:11.810> that<00:01:11.960> much<00:01:12.140> either<00:01:22.090> 64<00:01:23.090> carry<00:01:23.330> he

00:01:23.679 --> 00:01:23.689 
get injured that much either 64 carry he

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:25.300 
get injured that much either 64 carry he
has<00:01:23.810> yet<00:01:23.990> the<00:01:24.049> phone<00:01:24.320> before<00:01:24.439> me<00:01:24.830> she's<00:01:25.159> pretty

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:25.310 
has yet the phone before me she's pretty

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:29.320 
has yet the phone before me she's pretty
good<00:01:25.549> yet<00:01:27.369> 64<00:01:28.369> I<00:01:28.400> feel<00:01:28.700> like<00:01:28.790> that's<00:01:28.970> a<00:01:29.090> little

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:29.330 
good yet 64 I feel like that's a little

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:35.170 
good yet 64 I feel like that's a little
low<00:01:29.479> we<00:01:29.630> should<00:01:29.780> be<00:01:29.869> like<00:01:30.049> at<00:01:30.170> 75<00:01:33.579> 85<00:01:34.579> for<00:01:34.970> power

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:35.180 
low we should be like at 75 85 for power

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:39.219 
low we should be like at 75 85 for power
95<00:01:35.990> throws<00:01:36.290> 495<00:01:37.280> throw<00:01:37.640> mid<00:01:37.880> and<00:01:38.150> 95<00:01:38.990> throw

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:39.229 
95 throws 495 throw mid and 95 throw

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:41.679 
95 throws 495 throw mid and 95 throw
deep<00:01:39.470> that's<00:01:40.159> great<00:01:40.460> he's<00:01:40.939> dead<00:01:41.180> accurate

00:01:41.679 --> 00:01:41.689 
deep that's great he's dead accurate

00:01:41.689 --> 00:01:43.719 
deep that's great he's dead accurate
never<00:01:42.110> he<00:01:42.380> never<00:01:42.409> missed<00:01:42.860> a<00:01:42.920> passy<00:01:43.130> a<00:01:43.340> dead

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:43.729

accurate<00:01:44.210> throw<00:01:45.110> on<00:01:45.320> the<00:01:45.409> run<00:01:45.439> that's<00:01:46.009> really

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:46.310 
accurate throw on the run that's really

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:49.960 
accurate throw on the run that's really
odd<00:01:46.549> to<00:01:46.850> include<00:01:47.180> that<00:01:47.210> speed<00:01:48.460> 77<00:01:49.460> but<00:01:49.610> 99

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:49.970 
odd to include that speed 77 but 99

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:52.690 
odd to include that speed 77 but 99
throw<00:01:50.360> on<00:01:50.420> the<00:01:50.540> run<00:01:50.570> that's<00:01:50.960> really<00:01:51.259> odd<00:01:51.700> but

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:52.700 
throw on the run that's really odd but

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:54.639 
throw on the run that's really odd but
this<00:01:52.850> card<00:01:53.119> is<00:01:53.329> literally<00:01:53.600> meant<00:01:53.899> to<00:01:54.049> be<00:01:54.200> moved

much stronger compared to uh Aaron

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:53.940 
much stronger compared to uh Aaron
Rodgers<00:02:51.730> honestly<00:02:52.390> he<00:02:53.019> is<00:02:53.170> a<00:02:53.200> little<00:02:53.410> stronger

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:53.950 
Rodgers honestly he is a little stronger

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:57.479

I<00:02:53.980> think<00:02:54.340> and<00:02:54.549> he<00:02:54.610> has<00:02:54.730> lower<00:02:54.940> stats<00:02:56.130> but<00:02:57.130> in<00:02:57.370> a

00:02:57.479 --> 00:02:57.489 
I think and he has lower stats but in a

00:02:57.489 --> 00:02:58.830 
I think and he has lower stats but in a
couple<00:02:57.670> plays<00:02:58.030> you<00:02:58.239> will<00:02:58.330> be<00:02:58.480> seeing<00:02:58.630> him

00:02:58.830 --> 00:02:58.840 
couple plays you will be seeing him

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:03.059

running<00:02:59.230> run<00:03:00.720> he's<00:03:01.720> actually<00:03:01.959> pretty<00:03:02.410> fast<00:03:02.769> in

00:03:03.059 --> 00:03:03.069

running run he's actually pretty fast in
game<00:03:03.340> he<00:03:03.549> may<00:03:03.730> look<00:03:03.940> slow<00:03:04.239> but<00:03:04.480> in<00:03:04.630> game<00:03:04.930> he<00:03:05.380> is

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:05.440 
game he may look slow but in game he is

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:11.200

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:35.730 
out of 10 just because the speed is a

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:38.090 
out of 10 just because the speed is a
little<00:03:36.000> slow<00:03:36.240> and<00:03:36.510> his<00:03:36.660> downside<00:03:37.170> is<00:03:37.410> that<00:03:37.440> he

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:38.100 
little slow and his downside is that he

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:39.620 
little slow and his downside is that he
can<00:03:38.310> be<00:03:38.520> a<00:03:38.550> little<00:03:38.670> weak<00:03:38.970> every<00:03:39.240> once<00:03:39.420> in<00:03:39.570> a
