00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:17.500
 78 years ago in chevrolet they had the idea of 

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:20.680
 create a type of car that was supposed to 

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:22.300
 meet different needs then not 

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:24.340
 they knew for sure but with his 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:26.529
 barban had invented the suv 

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:28.300
 so logical that a brand like this 

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:29.730
 could not miss the opportunity to 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:32.019
 present your proposal 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.180
 within the most active segment of the 

00:00:32.019 --> 00:00:36.489
 the market is about compact suvs 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:38.830
 increasingly appreciated by customers in 

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:40.989
 continuous expansion also in Italy 

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:43.269
 let's talk about the trucks the last born of 

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:45.220
 bow tie a vehicle with dimensions 

00:00:43.269 --> 00:00:49.210
 contained in four 24 meters of 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:51.519
 length by 177 of wealth and 167 of 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:53.379
 height therefore suitable for urban traffic 

00:00:51.519 --> 00:00:56.530
 and that the renewal plan continues 

00:00:53.379 --> 00:00:59.559
 of the American home is a synthesis between 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:01.900
 a real SUV is a car 

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:04.000
 suitable for city use for one use 

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:07.409
 urban the car extremely agile and 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:10.180
 versatile with very low consumption 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:14.049
 especially in the versions invisible to the 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:15.340
 1700 we speak of over 20 km with a 

00:01:14.049 --> 00:01:17.920
 liter of diesel so really one 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:21.130
 vehicle suitable for use both by diver 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:22.480
 and real but also as a car 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:24.640
 town in every respect 

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:27.310
 three motorizations two types of 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:30.280
 traction starts with the 1600 petrol from 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:32.290
 115 horses only with front-wheel drive a 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:34.480
 which is joined by the more powerful 1400 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:38.020
 turbo available both two-wheel drive 

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:40.690
 both 4 and 140 diesel instead of the 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:42.940
 classic 1700 from 130 horses too 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:46.080
 in the two options but is also and 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:49.780
 above all an extremely car 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:52.479
 versatile versatility means 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:55.510
 small volumes but small size 

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:56.979
 large load capacity one 

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:58.780
 flexibility in terms of 

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:00.909
 internal configuration 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:02.920
 interior seats can have 8 

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:05.860
 load capacity configurations up to

 1,370 liters in length can be used 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:10.420
 stow objects up to 2 meters long 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:13.180
 30 so also the difficult test of the
