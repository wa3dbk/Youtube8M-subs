another<00:00:00.949> rhythmic<00:00:03.319> phenomenon<00:00:04.319> you<00:00:04.470> might

00:00:04.579 --> 00:00:04.589 
another rhythmic phenomenon you might

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:06.530 
another rhythmic phenomenon you might
come<00:00:04.830> across<00:00:04.859> in<00:00:05.460> your<00:00:05.580> reading<00:00:05.790> would<00:00:06.359> be<00:00:06.509> a

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:06.540 
come across in your reading would be a

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:08.560 
come across in your reading would be a
triplet<00:00:07.049> you<00:00:07.470> might<00:00:07.620> have<00:00:07.740> seen<00:00:07.890> this<00:00:08.040> before

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:08.570 
triplet you might have seen this before

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:12.640 
triplet you might have seen this before
basically<00:00:09.570> three<00:00:09.929> notes<00:00:10.139> connected<00:00:11.070> with<00:00:12.000> a

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:12.650 
basically three notes connected with a

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:15.860 
basically three notes connected with a
do<00:00:13.650> you<00:00:13.710> know<00:00:13.830> a<00:00:13.860> slash<00:00:14.490> and<00:00:14.790> then<00:00:14.820> a<00:00:15.240> three

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
do you know a slash and then a three

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:17.060 
do you know a slash and then a three
written<00:00:16.139> underneath<00:00:16.379> and<00:00:16.590> you<00:00:16.650> might<00:00:16.800> be<00:00:16.830> like

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
written underneath and you might be like

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:18.769 
written underneath and you might be like
when<00:00:17.520> you'd<00:00:17.699> seen<00:00:17.880> it<00:00:17.910> before<00:00:18.270> been<00:00:18.480> kind<00:00:18.690> of

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
when you'd seen it before been kind of

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:20.480 
when you'd seen it before been kind of
confused<00:00:19.230> but<00:00:19.710> now<00:00:19.800> we'll<00:00:19.920> kind<00:00:20.100> of<00:00:20.189> explain

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
confused but now we'll kind of explain

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.990 
confused but now we'll kind of explain
what<00:00:20.670> that<00:00:20.699> means<00:00:21.350> so<00:00:22.350> we<00:00:22.529> look<00:00:22.740> here<00:00:23.039> here's

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
what that means so we look here here's

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.839 
what that means so we look here here's
an<00:00:24.150> example<00:00:24.359> of<00:00:24.570> an<00:00:24.689> eighth<00:00:24.900> note<00:00:24.930> triplet<00:00:25.849> see

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
an example of an eighth note triplet see

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:30.380 
an example of an eighth note triplet see
we<00:00:27.000> have<00:00:27.150> three<00:00:28.019> notes<00:00:28.699> connected<00:00:29.699> above<00:00:30.179> as

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
we have three notes connected above as

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.269 
we have three notes connected above as
if<00:00:30.539> as<00:00:30.689> eighth<00:00:30.990> notes<00:00:31.260> would<00:00:31.439> be<00:00:31.529> but<00:00:31.740> usually

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
if as eighth notes would be but usually

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.580 
if as eighth notes would be but usually
we<00:00:32.369> would<00:00:32.430> have<00:00:32.579> maybe<00:00:32.730> four<00:00:33.090> or<00:00:33.120> two<00:00:33.420> that<00:00:34.410> has

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
we would have maybe four or two that has

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:35.990 
we would have maybe four or two that has
three<00:00:35.010> and<00:00:35.219> we<00:00:35.280> have<00:00:35.399> to<00:00:35.489> have<00:00:35.579> put<00:00:35.730> out<00:00:35.760> three

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
three and we have to have put out three

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.299 
three and we have to have put out three
underneath<00:00:36.420> to<00:00:36.840> signify<00:00:37.230> this<00:00:37.860> basically

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
underneath to signify this basically

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.340 
underneath to signify this basically
takes<00:00:38.579> up<00:00:38.760> one<00:00:39.030> beat<00:00:39.300> three<00:00:39.840> notes<00:00:40.020> and<00:00:40.230> one

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
takes up one beat three notes and one

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.569 
takes up one beat three notes and one
beat<00:00:40.620> but<00:00:41.340> went<00:00:41.610> within<00:00:41.940> a<00:00:42.860> measure<00:00:43.860> where<00:00:44.160> we

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
beat but went within a measure where we

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.250 
beat but went within a measure where we
are<00:00:44.730> in<00:00:44.910> quarter<00:00:45.270> notes<00:00:45.480> four<00:00:45.840> quarter<00:00:46.230> notes

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
are in quarter notes four quarter notes

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:52.580 
are in quarter notes four quarter notes
so<00:00:47.210> this<00:00:48.210> rhythm<00:00:48.450> would<00:00:48.690> sound<00:00:50.239> 112<00:00:51.239> done<00:00:51.750> then

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
so this rhythm would sound 112 done then

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:59.029 
so this rhythm would sound 112 done then
10<00:00:53.070> 10<00:00:53.430> 10<00:00:53.840> 1<00:00:54.840> and<00:00:56.149> but<00:00:57.350> the<00:00:58.350> way<00:00:58.469> you<00:00:58.530> can<00:00:58.890> it

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
10 10 10 1 and but the way you can it

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:00.740 
10 10 10 1 and but the way you can it
with<00:00:59.160> maybe<00:00:59.340> you<00:00:59.550> would<00:00:59.730> even<00:01:00.000> count<00:01:00.329> as<00:01:00.480> one

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
with maybe you would even count as one

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.920 
with maybe you would even count as one
two<00:01:00.899> three<00:01:01.140> one<00:01:01.170> two<00:01:01.440> three<00:01:01.710> two<00:01:02.570> one<00:01:03.570> two

three<00:01:07.320> three<00:01:07.770> two<00:01:08.130> three<00:01:08.400> if<00:01:09.000> they<00:01:09.180> were<00:01:09.240> all

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
three three two three if they were all

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.010 
three three two three if they were all
triplets<00:01:10.549> okay<00:01:11.549> eighth<00:01:12.210> note<00:01:12.450> triplets<00:01:12.840> are<00:01:12.930> a

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
triplets okay eighth note triplets are a

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.210 
triplets okay eighth note triplets are a
little<00:01:13.140> bit<00:01:13.320> easier<00:01:13.590> to<00:01:13.680> understand<00:01:14.130> because

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
little bit easier to understand because

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.640 
little bit easier to understand because
you<00:01:14.369> can<00:01:14.490> feel<00:01:14.760> them<00:01:14.939> as<00:01:15.060> being<00:01:15.210> one<00:01:15.479> beat<00:01:15.750> it

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
you can feel them as being one beat it

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.830 
you can feel them as being one beat it
more<00:01:16.860> difficult<00:01:17.040> are<00:01:17.490> the<00:01:18.299> quarter<00:01:18.689> note

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
more difficult are the quarter note

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.580 
more difficult are the quarter note
triplets<00:01:19.430> according<00:01:20.430> to<00:01:20.460> three<00:01:21.590> quarter

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
triplets according to three quarter

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.710 
triplets according to three quarter
notes<00:01:22.770> connected<00:01:23.340> as<00:01:23.460> triplets<00:01:23.939> take<00:01:24.420> up<00:01:24.570> the

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
notes connected as triplets take up the

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.230 
notes connected as triplets take up the
space<00:01:24.990> of<00:01:25.229> two<00:01:25.530> regular<00:01:26.009> quarter<00:01:26.369> notes<00:01:26.549> so

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
space of two regular quarter notes so

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.030 
space of two regular quarter notes so
this<00:01:27.390> is<00:01:27.540> almost<00:01:27.689> serves<00:01:28.680> a<00:01:29.009> function<00:01:29.040> of

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:31.040 
this is almost serves a function of

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:33.469 
this is almost serves a function of
metric<00:01:32.040> modulation<00:01:32.220> we<00:01:32.790> could<00:01:32.909> call<00:01:33.119> it<00:01:33.150> where

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
metric modulation we could call it where

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.990 
metric modulation we could call it where
you<00:01:33.750> feel<00:01:34.079> when<00:01:34.799> you<00:01:34.920> play<00:01:35.100> this<00:01:35.310> like<00:01:35.700> you<00:01:35.909> are

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
you feel when you play this like you are

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.450 
you feel when you play this like you are
playing<00:01:36.240> in<00:01:36.360> a<00:01:36.450> different<00:01:36.840> tempo<00:01:37.200> so<00:01:38.100> if<00:01:38.310> we

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
playing in a different tempo so if we

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.429 
playing in a different tempo so if we
played<00:01:38.939> pretending<00:01:39.750> this<00:01:39.869> measure<00:01:40.170> right

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
played pretending this measure right

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:43.510 
played pretending this measure right
here<00:01:40.710> with<00:01:40.890> all<00:01:41.070> just<00:01:41.310> quarter<00:01:41.549> notes<00:01:41.729> one<00:01:42.450> two

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:43.520 
here with all just quarter notes one two

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:48.880 
here with all just quarter notes one two
three<00:01:44.520> four<00:01:45.450> then<00:01:45.899> one<00:01:46.560> two<00:01:47.040> three<00:01:47.100> one<00:01:48.060> four

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:48.890 
three four then one two three one four

one two one two three four one two three
four<00:01:58.049> one<00:01:58.979> two<00:01:59.659> it's<00:02:00.659> very<00:02:00.899> difficult<00:02:01.259> to<00:02:01.590> hear

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
four one two it's very difficult to hear

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.039 
four one two it's very difficult to hear
sometimes<00:02:02.310> you<00:02:02.460> have<00:02:02.549> to<00:02:02.700> have<00:02:03.210> a<00:02:03.240> metronome

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
sometimes you have to have a metronome

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:13.729 
sometimes you have to have a metronome
to<00:02:04.320> help<00:02:04.500> you<00:02:04.619> out<00:02:04.770> so<00:02:05.490> let's<00:02:11.660> one<00:02:12.660> two<00:02:13.140> three

00:02:13.729 --> 00:02:13.739 
to help you out so let's one two three

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:18.650 
to help you out so let's one two three
one<00:02:13.770> two<00:02:14.550> three<00:02:14.670> one<00:02:15.390> two<00:02:16.160> three<00:02:17.160> four<00:02:17.790> one<00:02:18.629> two

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
one two three one two three four one two

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:22.550 
one two three one two three four one two
three<00:02:19.489> so<00:02:20.599> you'll<00:02:21.599> notice<00:02:21.780> quarter<00:02:22.440> note

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
three so you'll notice quarter note

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.350 
three so you'll notice quarter note
triplets<00:02:22.950> are<00:02:23.040> rare<00:02:23.310> but<00:02:23.670> they're<00:02:23.879> used<00:02:24.150> to
