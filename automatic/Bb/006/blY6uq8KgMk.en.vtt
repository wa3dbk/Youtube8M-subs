zero<00:00:10.040> position<00:00:10.550> is<00:00:10.960> biomechanics<00:00:11.960> really<00:00:12.230> I

00:00:12.249 --> 00:00:12.259 
zero position is biomechanics really I

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:14.829 
zero position is biomechanics really I
mean<00:00:12.469> it's<00:00:12.650> it's<00:00:13.580> a<00:00:13.730> pretty<00:00:13.969> heady<00:00:14.240> concept

00:00:14.829 --> 00:00:14.839 
mean it's it's a pretty heady concept

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:16.299 
mean it's it's a pretty heady concept
but<00:00:14.929> it's<00:00:15.080> a<00:00:15.139> term<00:00:15.380> that<00:00:15.410> was<00:00:15.710> created<00:00:16.219> by

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:16.309 
but it's a term that was created by

the back your shoulder that curves

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:36.760 
the back your shoulder that curves
it's<00:00:35.090> that<00:00:35.300> spot<00:00:35.660> about<00:00:35.870> six<00:00:36.200> inches<00:00:36.500> forward

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:36.770 
it's that spot about six inches forward

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:38.800 
it's that spot about six inches forward
of<00:00:36.920> the<00:00:36.980> shoulder<00:00:37.430> where<00:00:38.060> the<00:00:38.180> arm<00:00:38.420> is<00:00:38.570> in<00:00:38.720> that

of the shoulder where the arm is in that
proper<00:00:39.260> slot<00:00:39.560> think<00:00:40.340> about<00:00:40.550> bench<00:00:40.820> pressing

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:41.300 
proper slot think about bench pressing

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:42.640 
proper slot think about bench pressing
and<00:00:41.450> the<00:00:41.510> importance<00:00:41.930> of<00:00:42.050> staying<00:00:42.320> above<00:00:42.590> the

proper range of motion to throw zero

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:50.020 
proper range of motion to throw zero
position<00:00:47.390> gives<00:00:48.020> us<00:00:48.320> not<00:00:49.070> just<00:00:49.430> the<00:00:49.610> location

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:50.030 
position gives us not just the location

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:51.790 
position gives us not just the location
for<00:00:50.450> the<00:00:50.540> arm<00:00:50.690> to<00:00:50.840> be<00:00:50.960> and<00:00:51.140> to<00:00:51.200> operate<00:00:51.590> most

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:51.800 
for the arm to be and to operate most

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.370 
for the arm to be and to operate most
efficiently<00:00:52.070> but<00:00:52.970> it's<00:00:53.120> also<00:00:53.300> a<00:00:53.450> concept<00:00:54.079> that

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:54.380 
efficiently but it's also a concept that

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:56.560 
efficiently but it's also a concept that
becomes<00:00:55.070> what<00:00:55.220> we<00:00:55.250> call<00:00:55.550> the<00:00:55.700> dead<00:00:55.910> middle<00:00:56.210> of

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:56.570 
becomes what we call the dead middle of

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:58.990 
becomes what we call the dead middle of
the<00:00:57.020> throat<00:00:57.310> everything<00:00:58.310> up<00:00:58.460> to<00:00:58.610> zero<00:00:58.880> is

the throat everything up to zero is
about<00:00:59.270> generating<00:00:59.899> power<00:01:00.110> everything<00:01:00.470> from

about generating power everything from
zero<00:01:01.160> is<00:01:01.280> about<00:01:01.489> releasing<00:01:01.970> power<00:01:02.149> so<00:01:02.989> by

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:03.110 
zero is about releasing power so by

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:06.399 
zero is about releasing power so by

it before he ever throws the ball and

it before he ever throws the ball and
that<00:01:53.000> awareness<00:01:53.270> will<00:01:53.600> build<00:01:53.810> his<00:01:53.960> confidence

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:54.170 
that awareness will build his confidence
