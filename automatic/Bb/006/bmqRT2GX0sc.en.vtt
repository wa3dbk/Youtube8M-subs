that shoot medium format shoot with

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.429 
that shoot medium format shoot with
those<00:01:12.090> medium<00:01:12.390> format<00:01:12.570> cameras<00:01:13.020> because<00:01:13.320> they

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
those medium format cameras because they

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.499 
those medium format cameras because they
get<00:01:13.560> the<00:01:13.710> most<00:01:14.010> detail<00:01:14.490> and<00:01:14.909> the<00:01:15.030> sharpest

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
get the most detail and the sharpest

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.289 
get the most detail and the sharpest
images<00:01:15.900> because<00:01:16.200> there<00:01:16.350> are<00:01:16.500> no<00:01:16.740> filters

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:17.299 
images because there are no filters

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:19.940 
images because there are no filters
anti-aliasing<00:01:18.299> filters<00:01:18.689> involved<00:01:19.290> with<00:01:19.590> them

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
anti-aliasing filters involved with them

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.679 
anti-aliasing filters involved with them
so<00:01:20.430> I've<00:01:20.520> talked<00:01:20.820> to<00:01:20.970> some<00:01:21.150> of<00:01:21.180> those<00:01:21.299> guys<00:01:21.509> and

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
so I've talked to some of those guys and

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.630 
so I've talked to some of those guys and
they<00:01:21.780> said<00:01:21.810> that<00:01:22.229> is<00:01:22.470> the<00:01:22.650> what<00:01:23.310> they<00:01:23.430> look<00:01:23.610> for

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
they said that is the what they look for

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.370 
they said that is the what they look for
in<00:01:24.090> this<00:01:24.299> camera<00:01:24.630> is<00:01:24.840> the<00:01:24.990> fact<00:01:25.170> that<00:01:25.229> it

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
in this camera is the fact that it

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.260 
in this camera is the fact that it
doesn't<00:01:25.619> have<00:01:25.920> the<00:01:25.950> anti-aliasing<00:01:26.820> filter

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
doesn't have the anti-aliasing filter

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.749 
doesn't have the anti-aliasing filter
which<00:01:27.689> would<00:01:27.900> give<00:01:28.049> you<00:01:28.229> sharper<00:01:28.740> images<00:01:29.130> with

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
which would give you sharper images with

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:33.080 
which would give you sharper images with
slightly<00:01:30.270> more<00:01:30.450> detail<00:01:31.259> now<00:01:31.860> does<00:01:32.729> it<00:01:32.909> out

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
slightly more detail now does it out

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.270 
slightly more detail now does it out
with<00:01:33.360> you<00:01:33.869> know<00:01:33.990> just<00:01:34.500> having<00:01:34.710> it<00:01:34.979> in<00:01:35.159> the

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
with you know just having it in the

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:36.649 
with you know just having it in the
camera<00:01:35.579> versus<00:01:35.790> not<00:01:35.939> having<00:01:36.360> it<00:01:36.450> and<00:01:36.630> having

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
camera versus not having it and having

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.690 
camera versus not having it and having
to<00:01:36.960> correct<00:01:37.259> it<00:01:37.350> later<00:01:37.380> is<00:01:37.799> that<00:01:38.250> a<00:01:38.280> good<00:01:38.460> thing

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
to correct it later is that a good thing

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:39.980 
to correct it later is that a good thing
or<00:01:38.880> is<00:01:38.939> that<00:01:39.150> a<00:01:39.180> bad<00:01:39.420> thing<00:01:39.450> if<00:01:39.780> you're<00:01:39.960> a

most detailed images that's what you're
gonna<00:02:33.390> get<00:02:33.600> from<00:02:33.750> this<00:02:33.840> but<00:02:34.140> you're<00:02:34.260> paying<00:02:34.440> a

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
gonna get from this but you're paying a

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:36.560 
gonna get from this but you're paying a
price<00:02:34.740> you're<00:02:34.920> paying<00:02:34.950> $300<00:02:35.760> more<00:02:35.970> and<00:02:36.210> the

price you're paying $300 more and the

price you're paying $300 more and the
only<00:02:36.720> difference<00:02:37.140> is<00:02:37.380> it<00:02:37.800> doesn't<00:02:38.340> have<00:02:38.580> that

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
only difference is it doesn't have that

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:42.140 
only difference is it doesn't have that
anti-aliasing<00:02:39.480> filters<00:02:39.870> so<00:02:40.940> let's<00:02:41.940> just

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
anti-aliasing filters so let's just

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.990 
anti-aliasing filters so let's just
unbox<00:02:42.300> it<00:02:42.660> sniff<00:02:42.960> it<00:02:43.170> and<00:02:43.320> move<00:02:43.830> on<00:02:44.100> so<00:02:44.880> there

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
unbox it sniff it and move on so there

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.190 
unbox it sniff it and move on so there
aren't<00:02:45.150> going<00:02:45.300> to<00:02:45.360> be<00:02:45.420> any<00:02:45.450> sample<00:02:45.930> images

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
aren't going to be any sample images

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:47.510 
aren't going to be any sample images
taken<00:02:46.350> with<00:02:46.470> this<00:02:46.710> because<00:02:46.890> this<00:02:47.100> is<00:02:47.160> not<00:02:47.280> my

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:46.220 
sharper images a little bit more detail
because<00:03:44.730> of<00:03:45.060> the<00:03:45.300> fact<00:03:45.600> that<00:03:45.720> it<00:03:45.900> does<00:03:46.080> not

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:46.620 
images that they're getting the detail

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:48.590 
images that they're getting the detail
that<00:04:46.860> they're<00:04:47.280> getting<00:04:47.400> out<00:04:47.760> of<00:04:47.940> the<00:04:48.240> shadow

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:48.600 
that they're getting out of the shadow

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:50.900 
that they're getting out of the shadow
information<00:04:49.500> out<00:04:50.010> of<00:04:50.220> the<00:04:50.280> shadow<00:04:50.580> side<00:04:50.880> of

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:50.910 
information out of the shadow side of

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:53.030 
information out of the shadow side of
the<00:04:51.120> face<00:04:51.180> is<00:04:51.540> incredible<00:04:52.260> and<00:04:52.380> they<00:04:52.590> love<00:04:52.890> it

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:53.040 
the face is incredible and they love it

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:57.710 
the face is incredible and they love it
so<00:04:54.080> yeah<00:04:55.080> why<00:04:55.560> is<00:04:55.620> it<00:04:55.770> $300<00:04:56.280> more<00:04:56.570> because<00:04:57.570> it's

00:04:57.710 --> 00:04:57.720 
so yeah why is it $300 more because it's

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:00.560 
so yeah why is it $300 more because it's
it's<00:04:58.050> special<00:04:58.470> it's<00:04:59.160> missing<00:04:59.520> one<00:04:59.550> thing<00:04:59.940> it's

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:00.570 
it's special it's missing one thing it's

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:02.090 
it's special it's missing one thing it's
just<00:05:00.750> a<00:05:00.870> limited<00:05:01.380> run<00:05:01.560> when<00:05:01.740> you<00:05:01.800> have<00:05:01.920> to<00:05:02.010> do

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:02.100 
just a limited run when you have to do

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:04.880 
just a limited run when you have to do
less<00:05:02.370> production<00:05:03.210> cost<00:05:04.140> is<00:05:04.290> going<00:05:04.470> to<00:05:04.560> go<00:05:04.710> up

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:04.890 
less production cost is going to go up

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:06.680 
less production cost is going to go up
so<00:05:04.920> they<00:05:05.160> expect<00:05:05.940> a<00:05:06.000> lot<00:05:06.030> of<00:05:06.150> people<00:05:06.270> to<00:05:06.510> want

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:06.690 
so they expect a lot of people to want

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:09.560 
so they expect a lot of people to want
this<00:05:06.840> camera<00:05:07.230> will<00:05:08.040> they<00:05:08.160> need<00:05:08.340> it<00:05:08.460> who<00:05:09.360> knows

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:09.570 
this camera will they need it who knows

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:11.210 
this camera will they need it who knows
but<00:05:10.110> that's<00:05:10.260> really<00:05:10.560> what<00:05:10.740> you're<00:05:10.890> doing<00:05:11.130> is

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:11.220 
but that's really what you're doing is

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:12.950 
but that's really what you're doing is
