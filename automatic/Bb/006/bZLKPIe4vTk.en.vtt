ones in there if you twisted and do all
kinds<00:01:44.670> of<00:01:44.729> things<00:01:44.820> that<00:01:45.060> will<00:01:45.299> do<00:01:46.020> different

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
kinds of things that will do different

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:47.990 
kinds of things that will do different
things<00:01:46.439> as<00:01:46.770> well<00:01:46.920> but<00:01:46.950> you<00:01:47.399> can<00:01:47.430> do<00:01:47.670> all<00:01:47.820> that

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
things as well but you can do all that

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.910 
things as well but you can do all that
stuff<00:01:48.060> by<00:01:48.479> just<00:01:48.750> swiping<00:01:48.990> on<00:01:49.290> the<00:01:49.350> screen<00:01:49.439> from

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
stuff by just swiping on the screen from

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.100 
stuff by just swiping on the screen from
the<00:01:49.950> right<00:01:50.250> left<00:01:50.670> up<00:01:50.909> down<00:01:50.939> you<00:01:51.210> get<00:01:51.600> the<00:01:51.750> idea

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
the right left up down you get the idea

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.590 
the right left up down you get the idea
so<00:01:52.350> that's<00:01:53.130> kind<00:01:53.460> of<00:01:53.579> the<00:01:53.850> gist<00:01:54.149> of<00:01:54.329> how<00:01:54.479> it

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
so that's kind of the gist of how it

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.480 
so that's kind of the gist of how it
works<00:01:54.840> I<00:01:54.990> mean<00:01:55.140> it's<00:01:55.259> very<00:01:55.470> you<00:01:56.009> know<00:01:56.100> basic

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
works I mean it's very you know basic

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.609 
works I mean it's very you know basic
from<00:01:56.610> that<00:01:56.759> aspect<00:01:57.180> I<00:01:57.360> mean<00:01:57.540> you<00:01:57.990> can<00:01:58.170> see<00:01:58.469> on

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
from that aspect I mean you can see on

00:01:58.619 --> 00:01:59.840 
from that aspect I mean you can see on
the<00:01:58.740> you<00:01:59.070> know<00:01:59.159> what<00:01:59.369> apps<00:01:59.579> you<00:01:59.759> have

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850

installed<00:02:00.000> in<00:02:00.479> the<00:02:00.540> cloud<00:02:01.219> if<00:02:02.219> you<00:02:02.280> you<00:02:02.820> know

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
installed in the cloud if you you know

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:04.789 
installed in the cloud if you you know
once<00:02:03.119> you<00:02:03.210> swipe<00:02:03.479> up<00:02:03.689> to<00:02:04.020> get<00:02:04.140> to<00:02:04.229> the<00:02:04.320> app<00:02:04.500> to

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
once you swipe up to get to the app to

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:06.770 
once you swipe up to get to the app to
choose<00:02:05.310> between<00:02:05.490> cloud<00:02:05.909> and<00:02:06.180> device<00:02:06.390> which<00:02:06.630> is

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
choose between cloud and device which is

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.839 
choose between cloud and device which is
nice<00:02:06.960> I<00:02:07.170> do<00:02:07.229> like<00:02:07.590> that<00:02:07.619> it<00:02:08.039> definitely<00:02:08.489> shows

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.540 
device when it's in the cloud like if I

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:16.150 
device when it's in the cloud like if I
wanted<00:02:14.900> on<00:02:15.020> the<00:02:15.200> right<00:02:15.350> thigh<00:02:15.530> just<00:02:15.650> do<00:02:15.830> a<00:02:15.860> long

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:26.270 
downloading it right to the device so

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:28.030 
downloading it right to the device so
I'll<00:02:26.390> do<00:02:26.540> another<00:02:26.780> one<00:02:26.990> let's<00:02:27.170> say<00:02:27.320> Skype<00:02:27.680> and

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
downloading right to the device so

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:32.380 
downloading right to the device so
that's<00:02:31.880> kind<00:02:32.090> of<00:02:32.150> cool

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:32.390

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:31.000 
caught on to this actual camera I'm
using<00:03:28.340> so<00:03:28.960> it's<00:03:29.960> pretty<00:03:30.170> cool<00:03:30.440> you'd<00:03:30.710> have<00:03:30.860> to

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:31.010 
using so it's pretty cool you'd have to

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:32.800 
using so it's pretty cool you'd have to
really<00:03:31.490> see<00:03:31.700> that<00:03:31.730> for<00:03:31.970> yourself<00:03:32.330> to<00:03:32.450> test<00:03:32.690> it

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:32.810 
really see that for yourself to test it

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:35.110 
really see that for yourself to test it
out<00:03:32.930> but<00:03:33.470> that's<00:03:33.620> basically<00:03:34.190> how<00:03:34.610> you<00:03:34.640> use<00:03:35.000> the

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:35.120 
out but that's basically how you use the

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:36.820 
out but that's basically how you use the
device<00:03:35.240> I<00:03:35.390> mean<00:03:35.690> it<00:03:35.900> actually<00:03:36.140> is<00:03:36.470> a<00:03:36.590> nice
