 against our rivals but they do not know the 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:44.360
 true struggle that happens at home and is what 

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:47.870
 that we have been promoting in this 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:50.570

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:57.950
 next March 10 this Sunday for 

00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:00.110
 all the wrestling fans 

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:03.020
 who want to know about this documentary 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:06.139
 the documentary is a fighter and as well 

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:07.550
 He said he knows it's 8 o'clock at night 

00:01:06.139 --> 00:01:10.550
 channel 3 

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:12.710
 since it's practically a little bit I know 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:14.270
 that you lived here in the area of 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:17.450
 angels talk a little about that 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:21.530
 you lived for that because I think that 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:23.660
 like all Mexican family we come to 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:26.420
 the American dream I think that I 

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:29.240
 I enjoyed one of my biggest 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:33.140
 blessings may that I could learn 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:35.990
 the language I took it to mexico I learned 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:37.730
 to fight the Olympic fight with the best 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:40.100
 teachers I had the opportunity to go to the 

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:42.620
 of going to fields training to the 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:44.570
 arizona's energy of being justine 

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:47.510
 so I think it was a great 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:49.940
 experience apart then a pride 

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:52.420
 Mexican not having learned here go to 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:55.340
 mexico or compete in national tournaments 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:57.500
 be national champion of mexico 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:59.780
 I think it was something my dad asked me 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:02.720
 to be a professional fighter and I did it 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:04.850
 which is what people do not know about a 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:06.320
 fighter then look at my case is 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:09.890
 a story 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:11.780
 and very complex very beautiful because they are going to 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:15.020
 see the wrestler's suffering because 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:18.800
 because I had a tendon injury 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:20.450
 patellar I broke the tendon two months 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:22.520
 before starting to record then the 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:24.350
 producers were very concerned and 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:26.080
 good thing is that we wanted to see the 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:28.270
 fighter 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:30.340
 Now you are going to see the fighter how he has 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:33.160
 to get ahead how you have to look 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:35.800
 other life options to go out 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:38.710
 go ahead because life is still hurt 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:41.890
 no the fight goes on and they will see a being 

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:45.040
 human struggling with mistakes with many 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:48.100
 virtues putting a business fighting 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:49.990
 with the woman crying or there are things 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:53.230
 very pretty even for the dog and now 

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:55.510
 we are going so very like the life of us 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:58.420
 Mexicans in general is a great 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:03:01.930
 telenovela because we are beings 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:04.300
 humans at the end of the day people 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:06.400
 will identify with the fighters and 

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:09.670
 with us because we are human beings 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:12.070
 because we are people who fight day after day 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:14.650
 not only above the ring below so 

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:16.480
 that we know how good all the rest 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:18.459
 but we know that you had a mask 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:20.250
 and how hard it is for a fighter 

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:23.240
 lose that mask 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:26.300
 Well, look at the mask 

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:27.740
 makes a character makes the fighter the 

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:29.870
 wrestler gets a thousand gyms 

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:33.230
 training and that too they will see 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:35.810
 in the program that many times the 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:37.210
 character mask or no mask 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:39.470
 luchador wrestler does the person 

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:41.360
 not how you deliver above the 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:44.390
 quadrilateral and then I losing the 

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:46.880
 mask, yes, I feel a sadness 

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:50.860
 weakness of thinking went through my mind 

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:54.590
 that he lost everything but there was a moment 

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:56.990
 once those opportunities those touches 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:59.420
 divine not because I losing the 

00:03:56.990 --> 00:04:01.910
 mask I remember that after giving a 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:04.270
 great fight against mister fog people 

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:07.090
 I chanted my name 

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:10.430
 and I grabbed micro as I saw it roll 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:13.100
 grabbed and I say thank you very much 

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:16.040
 your applause but I do not care 

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:18.170
 I am a thousand percent under my name that 

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:20.450
 the receiving is started to remind me 

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:23.590
 on the way to death and on May 10 until 

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:23.590
 the starting pair 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:30.850
 said in the past that you're not even 

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:34.730
 technical nor tough 

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:38.540
 because you are not more preferred to take 

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:39.860
 human looks yes yes yes yes I have taken it in 

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:42.200
 this moment I am in the technical side 

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:44.540
 for people who do not know the side 

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:47.390
 rough are the bad ones that we sting or the 

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:50.090
 they stick the basses and the technicians they are 

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:52.580
 those who use abel's counter-spot a 

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:54.800
 good launch to win it I like it 

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:58.790
 much the network that part because yes I am very 

00:04:54.800 --> 00:05:01.580
 Handsome but I have a rough face, not the 

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:03.350
 true yes very without turning half blood 

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:09.170
 to people who do not even know me 

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:11.990
 many times like that but I think that my 

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:14.249
 parents of whom I am very proud 

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:16.980
 they gave me 

00:05:14.249 --> 00:05:21.670
 a gift that is this 

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:24.580
 knowing how to know how to treat people 

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:27.040
 Well now that with much much 

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:30.580
 kindness with a lot of decency to treat 

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:34.120
 everyone alike I do not think that 's one 

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:37.090
 of my best gifts the virtues and 

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:39.160
 the values that my parents gave me 

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:42.790
 there is a side that you enjoy more 

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:45.340
 technician for one and honestly I would 

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:46.900
 love making noise I love it because 

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:49.690
 because apart from that you take the 

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:51.430
 he scolds and many times the hatred of 

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:53.680
 public but like you have more 

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:56.490
 freedom above the table have more 

00:05:53.680 --> 00:06:08.320
 freedom to make fun of doing and undoing 

00:05:56.490 --> 00:06:10.630
 but good also being technical is very 

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:12.940
