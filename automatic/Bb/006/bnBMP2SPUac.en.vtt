these types of rock structures and their

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.540 
these types of rock structures and their
construct<00:01:07.409> or<00:01:07.590> the<00:01:07.710> activity<00:01:08.159> I<00:01:08.190> guess

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:08.550 
construct or the activity I guess

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:10.220 
construct or the activity I guess
building<00:01:09.030> towards<00:01:09.450> these<00:01:09.540> structures<00:01:09.960> being

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:10.230 
building towards these structures being

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:12.380 
building towards these structures being
being<00:01:10.680> generated<00:01:11.040> by<00:01:11.310> microbes<00:01:11.790> when<00:01:12.240> it<00:01:12.330> was

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
being generated by microbes when it was

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:18.790 
being generated by microbes when it was
very<00:01:12.659> very<00:01:13.100> extensive<00:01:14.100> throughout<00:01:14.370> the<00:01:14.490> earth

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:18.800 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:21.440 

so<00:01:19.800> we<00:01:19.830> have<00:01:20.160> four<00:01:20.460> guiding<00:01:20.730> principles<00:01:21.360> for

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
so we have four guiding principles for

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.840 
so we have four guiding principles for
this<00:01:21.690> project<00:01:21.900> first<00:01:22.500> is<00:01:22.680> safety<00:01:22.950> next<00:01:23.760> is

the lake is very interesting to us when

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:54.920 
the lake is very interesting to us when
it<00:01:53.490> comes<00:01:53.700> to<00:01:53.850> understanding<00:01:54.360> the<00:01:54.450> microbial

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
it comes to understanding the microbial

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.500 
it comes to understanding the microbial
eyes<00:01:55.080> but<00:01:55.590> it's<00:01:55.710> also<00:01:55.890> interesting<00:01:56.220> from<00:01:56.790> the

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:57.510 
eyes but it's also interesting from the

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:04.520 
the other thing that we're trying to do

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:07.060 
the other thing that we're trying to do
is<00:02:04.820> to<00:02:05.390> help<00:02:05.570> get<00:02:06.080> humans<00:02:06.380> to<00:02:06.530> the<00:02:06.650> moon<00:02:06.740> and

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:07.070 
is to help get humans to the moon and

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:09.070 
is to help get humans to the moon and
mars<00:02:07.190> and<00:02:07.580> when<00:02:08.090> they<00:02:08.210> get<00:02:08.390> there<00:02:08.570> to<00:02:08.750> do<00:02:08.869> some

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:09.080 
mars and when they get there to do some

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:11.890 
mars and when they get there to do some
really<00:02:09.290> solid<00:02:09.649> science<00:02:10.399> and<00:02:11.330> so<00:02:11.540> the

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:11.900 
really solid science and so the

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:14.080 
really solid science and so the
mechanisms<00:02:12.560> the<00:02:12.770> tools<00:02:13.100> that<00:02:13.280> we<00:02:13.430> use<00:02:13.550> the<00:02:14.000> way

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
mechanisms the tools that we use the way

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:15.610 
mechanisms the tools that we use the way
that<00:02:14.270> we<00:02:14.360> think<00:02:14.390> the<00:02:14.840> way<00:02:14.870> that<00:02:14.960> we<00:02:15.170> organize

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
that we think the way that we organize

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:18.910 
that we think the way that we organize
ourselves<00:02:15.830> is<00:02:17.230> essentially<00:02:18.230> being<00:02:18.440> used<00:02:18.680> as<00:02:18.890> a

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:18.920 
ourselves is essentially being used as a

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:21.220 
ourselves is essentially being used as a
foundation<00:02:19.400> for<00:02:19.640> thought<00:02:20.060> for<00:02:20.330> how<00:02:21.020> you<00:02:21.080> might

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.230 
foundation for thought for how you might

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:24.280 
foundation for thought for how you might
run<00:02:21.620> a<00:02:21.800> mission<00:02:22.190> to<00:02:22.370> the<00:02:22.400> moon<00:02:22.490> or<00:02:22.940> mars<00:02:23.290> when

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.290 
run a mission to the moon or mars when

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:26.350 
run a mission to the moon or mars when
humans<00:02:24.740> are<00:02:24.920> your<00:02:25.070> primary<00:02:25.340> data<00:02:25.850> collection

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:26.360 
humans are your primary data collection

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:28.690 
humans are your primary data collection
and<00:02:26.540> primary<00:02:27.050> explorers<00:02:27.680> not<00:02:27.980> robots<00:02:28.430> but

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:28.700 
and primary explorers not robots but

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:31.840 
and primary explorers not robots but
humans<00:02:29.090> and<00:02:29.930> that's<00:02:30.140> why<00:02:30.350> this<00:02:30.740> project<00:02:31.730> has

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:31.850 
humans and that's why this project has

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:34.090 
humans and that's why this project has
grown<00:02:32.240> that's<00:02:32.840> why<00:02:33.020> we've<00:02:33.350> brought<00:02:33.680> in<00:02:33.770> new

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:34.100 
grown that's why we've brought in new

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:35.730 
grown that's why we've brought in new
people<00:02:34.400> for<00:02:34.520> the<00:02:34.610> different<00:02:34.910> disciplines<00:02:35.360> and

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:35.740 
people for the different disciplines and

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:38.920 
people for the different disciplines and
that's<00:02:36.740> why<00:02:36.920> we<00:02:37.400> are<00:02:37.850> still<00:02:38.060> here<00:02:38.330> because<00:02:38.540> we

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:38.930 
that's why we are still here because we

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:40.660 
that's why we are still here because we
have<00:02:39.050> many<00:02:39.320> many<00:02:39.560> new<00:02:39.890> questions<00:02:40.340> that<00:02:40.490> keep

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:40.670 
have many many new questions that keep

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:42.610 
have many many new questions that keep
coming<00:02:40.910> up<00:02:41.180> as<00:02:41.540> a<00:02:41.600> consequence<00:02:42.260> of<00:02:42.440> us

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:42.620 
coming up as a consequence of us

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:44.890 
coming up as a consequence of us
researching<00:02:43.220> this<00:02:43.340> site<00:02:43.580> and<00:02:43.760> that<00:02:43.820> to<00:02:44.540> me<00:02:44.570> is

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
researching this site and that to me is

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:49.960 
researching this site and that to me is
really<00:02:45.440> great<00:02:45.709> science<00:02:48.400> when<00:02:49.400> I<00:02:49.430> think<00:02:49.760> of<00:02:49.850> the

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:49.970 
really great science when I think of the

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:51.699 
really great science when I think of the
pavilion<00:02:50.360> like<00:02:50.510> research<00:02:50.870> project<00:02:51.350> I<00:02:51.530> think

00:02:51.699 --> 00:02:51.709 
pavilion like research project I think

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:53.890 
pavilion like research project I think
immediately<00:02:51.950> of<00:02:52.370> teamwork<00:02:52.940> of<00:02:53.300> a<00:02:53.480> team<00:02:53.690> effort

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:53.900 
immediately of teamwork of a team effort

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:57.280 
immediately of teamwork of a team effort
and<00:02:54.170> part<00:02:54.890> of<00:02:55.010> this<00:02:55.160> team<00:02:55.570> is<00:02:56.570> the<00:02:56.990> local

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:57.290 
and part of this team is the local

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:59.470 
and part of this team is the local
community<00:02:57.440> they<00:02:58.160> the<00:02:58.670> local<00:02:58.790> community<00:02:59.120> has

00:02:59.470 --> 00:02:59.480 
community they the local community has

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:00.910 
community they the local community has
given<00:02:59.720> us<00:02:59.840> so<00:03:00.050> much<00:03:00.170> support<00:03:00.530> over<00:03:00.770> the<00:03:00.800> years

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:02.660 
and we could not have done anything

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:04.390 
and we could not have done anything
