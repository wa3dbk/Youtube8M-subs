 are in service with special forces 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:52.890
 and various power structures in a very 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.840
 in many countries of the world is also a name with a huge 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.750
 enjoy the arrows 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:00.899
 lovers of high-precision enthusiasts and 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:04.110
 far shooting forehead of all countries tom 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:06.049
 including in Ukraine in 2010 the company 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.850
 and introduced a new series 

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:12.210
 precision weapons called apex 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:14.250
 and some specimens from this lineup 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:19.650
 presented in front of our range 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:21.070
 This model is called a and x 338 this 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.650
 rifle in caliber in front 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:26.470
 8 la paloma dwarf and now we will try 

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:29.680
 discuss in detail all its features and 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:31.030
 unique features and so rifle barrel a 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:34.150
 x 338 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:36.580
 68 centimeters long 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:39.940
 heavy profile it is made of 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:41.920
 weapon-grade stainless steel and has on 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:43.869
 end thread for installation 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:46.450
 muzzle brake compensator which 

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:48.640
 either the muffler is preinstalled here 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:50.440
 The new two-chamber fish is very 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:52.180
 effectively copes with returns even 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:56.590
 such a large caliber 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:59.140
 step grooves at this trunk 19 integer 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:01.630
 four tenths of an inch for sure 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:04.450
 stabilization in the heaviest and most 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:05.950
 effective bullets in 338 hummingbirds 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:08.110
 rifle parts made of 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:10.290
 high strength aviation aluminum 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:12.820
 7075 t6 

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:14.700
 the trunk is naturally freely hung here 

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:18.760
 installed console forearm 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:21.190
 with an additional locking system 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:23.709
 slat picatinny kei mod type on handguard 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:26.590
 already installed adapter bracket for 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:28.720
 Harris bipods which is very convenient 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:31.390
 also pay attention to the receiver 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:34.269
 installed plant pikatini plank with 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:36.400
 tilt of 30 angular minutes which 

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:38.769
 makes up almost one with 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:40.840
 the same level on the handguard 

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:42.310
 This is done in order to rifle 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:45.310
 it was possible to establish overall 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:47.620
 high multiplicity optics and various 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:50.290
 pre objective night vision attachments 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:52.360
 thermal and so on this version 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:53.560
 rifle different folding 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:56.230
 adjustable butt 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:58.209
 here is his button 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:01.630
 folding he folds to the left 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:02.079
 side and fixed on it so 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:03.850
 way 

00:03:02.079 --> 00:03:06.510
 the total length of the rifle is slightly 

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:10.610
 shortened for easy transportation 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:12.260
 butt can be customized 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:15.740
 under individual anatomical 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:18.560
 arrow features adjust height 

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:21.620
 pods of its shift relative to the axis 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:23.870
 butt and turn in some limits 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:27.260
 You can also adjust the overall length. 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:29.570
 butt the height of the back plate here 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:33.910
 install an additional third leg 

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:37.370
 either monopod pistol grip 

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:39.470
 plastic rifles and back 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:40.220
 made replaceable that is, it is also possible 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:42.320
 replace 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:45.110
 and sets the one that is greatest 

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:48.020
 way the shutter is right for you 

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:48.739
 rifles are distinguished by the original 

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:52.280
 design 

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:55.430
 these Rosinter start as you can see on the body 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:58.100
 shutter applied longitudinal dollars and 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:59.780
 tucks are not meant to 

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:02.360
 rifle worked reliably even in 

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:05.770
 pollution conditions or icing 

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:08.120
 all unnecessary things will accumulate here 

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:09.920
 also note the shutter consists 

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:12.980
 two parts is the body of the shutter and 

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:16.489
 bolt and larva bolt larva we 

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:19.519
 see six lugs distant friend 

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:22.240
 from a friend at an angle of 120 degrees the system 

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:24.340
 two-row lugs and allows 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:27.650
 lock shutter 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:29.840
 turning his grip just 60 

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:32.479
 degrees is convenient because working with 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:34.520
 handle does not interfere with dimensional 

00:04:32.479 --> 00:04:35.870
 high expansion optics which can 

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:39.080
 set on this rifle 

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:41.590
 also in x 338 is the extractor better 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:44.390
 making it even more reliable 

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:47.570
 interesting feature of the slide group 

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:49.820
 rifles x 330 83 that when ammo 

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:51.650
 in the store and you run out of shutter 

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:54.530
 close will not be able to work such 

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:56.760
 a kind of slide delay in order 

00:04:54.530 --> 00:05:00.990
 to close 

00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:03.570
 shop need to extract constipation we see 

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:06.900
 three position fuse average 

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:09.570
 position it blocks you stingy with us 

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:12.950
 position, it also blocks the handle 

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:15.270
 shutter meaning it will not be removed 

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:17.190
 also note the shank 

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:19.470
 shutter in this case this part 

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:21.330
 drummer he signals that 

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:26.760
 rifle cocked and ready to fire 

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:29.280
 Now this projection it can be clearly seen if 

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:32.630
 rifle from a platoon I take that 

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:35.640
 accordingly, there will be no such protrusion 

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:37.740
 rifle magazine system one of 

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:39.930
 The most reliable and most famous in the world 

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:42.990
 because production stores and 

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:45.650
 cuirass international enjoys very 

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:48.240
 many precision weapons manufacturers 

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:50.550
 in this case the capacity of this 

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:53.520
 double row store is 10 

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:55.830
 338 caliber cartridges and note 

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:57.570
 how convenient is the store to insert 

00:05:55.830 --> 00:06:00.950
 the magazine is inserted on the left side 

00:05:57.570 --> 00:06:04.760
 the rifle does not need to be lifted 

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:08.100
 just rest with it so you raise 

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:11.130
 all store is set to 

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:15.350
 you need to take it to latch forward 

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:17.640
 store and he will fall in your hand and 

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:20.130
 certainly absolutely necessary 

00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:23.190
 component of a high-precision system is 

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:25.560
 two-stage adjustable trigger 

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:28.170
 mechanism mocha latte on which you can 

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:30.680
 tune by force and position 

00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:32.600
 trigger 

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:35.479
 so every shooter can 

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:40.280
 configure it as it will be convenient for him 

00:06:35.479 --> 00:06:42.320
 rifle x 338 massive enough 

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:44.600
 pretty size on 

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:46.820
 it is intended primarily for 

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:49.160
 shooting at big and super big 

00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:52.570
 distances we recommend to the data 

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:54.710
 rifles optics Japanese march company 

00:06:52.570 --> 00:06:56.870
 which is also some place 

00:06:54.710 --> 00:07:01.539
 unique features for example given 

00:06:56.870 --> 00:07:06.080
 The scope has a range of multiplicity from 5 to 

00:07:01.539 --> 00:07:08.419
 50 x and we recommend this 

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:11.389
 Swedish company rifles 

00:07:08.419 --> 00:07:12.370
 dispute about which we told quite 

00:07:11.389 --> 00:07:14.810
 recently 

00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:16.849
 exception, I note that modern record 

00:07:14.810 --> 00:07:18.740
 the most distant effective shot 

00:07:16.849 --> 00:07:22.580
 owned by british sniper corporal 

00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:27.800
 craig harrison who put it on 

00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:29.210
 distance of 2475 meters seems from 

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:32.270
 rifle production and cuirass 

00:07:29.210 --> 00:07:34.900
 International from the models of the previous line 

00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:37.400
 which was called arctic warfare could 

00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:40.340
 for many of our viewers it will probably be 

00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:41.720
 more understandable if I call it informal 

00:07:40.340 --> 00:07:45.860
 name elephant fear 

00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:47.780
 so here is the rifle x 338 it is in 

00:07:45.860 --> 00:07:50.360
 many ways superior to previous 

00:07:47.780 --> 00:07:53.210
 model and is designed just to 

00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:54.199
 who would like to shoot big and over 

00:07:53.210 --> 00:07:56.900
 long distances 

00:07:54.199 --> 00:07:59.479
 so if you have any if you 

00:07:56.900 --> 00:08:03.580
 You are interested in this topic, we are very 

00:07:59.479 --> 00:08:03.580
 recommend to pay attention to this
