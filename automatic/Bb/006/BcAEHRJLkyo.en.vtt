this<00:00:22.650> year's<00:00:22.949> okay<00:00:23.910> for<00:00:24.300> burst<00:00:24.539> assault<00:00:24.960> rifle

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:25.670 
this year's okay for burst assault rifle

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:29.839 
this year's okay for burst assault rifle
with<00:00:26.670> the<00:00:27.289> quick-draw<00:00:28.289> handle<00:00:28.740> fast<00:00:29.160> mag<00:00:29.490> and

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
with the quick-draw handle fast mag and

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:32.740 
with the quick-draw handle fast mag and
red<00:00:30.179> dot<00:00:30.420> sights<00:00:31.009> very<00:00:32.009> simple<00:00:32.369> setup

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:32.750 
red dot sights very simple setup

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:34.970 
red dot sights very simple setup
actually<00:00:33.750> thought<00:00:34.020> that<00:00:34.170> i<00:00:34.230> was<00:00:34.320> using<00:00:34.380> the

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
actually thought that i was using the

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.709 
actually thought that i was using the
adjustment<00:00:35.460> of<00:00:35.489> stockings<00:00:35.940> of<00:00:36.059> the<00:00:36.149> fast<00:00:36.420> mag

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
adjustment of stockings of the fast mag

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:39.229 
adjustment of stockings of the fast mag
but<00:00:37.559> it<00:00:37.770> turned<00:00:38.040> out<00:00:38.250> that<00:00:38.309> i<00:00:38.700> picked<00:00:39.059> the

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
but it turned out that i picked the

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:40.970 
but it turned out that i picked the
wrong<00:00:39.390> attachment<00:00:40.170> but<00:00:40.350> this<00:00:40.800> shouldn't

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
wrong attachment but this shouldn't

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.860 
wrong attachment but this shouldn't
matter<00:00:41.160> all<00:00:41.309> that<00:00:41.340> much<00:00:41.670> which<00:00:42.510> just<00:00:42.690> means

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
matter all that much which just means

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.350 
matter all that much which just means
that<00:00:42.989> I'll<00:00:43.200> have<00:00:43.230> to<00:00:44.040> be<00:00:44.160> more<00:00:44.190> accurate<00:00:44.579> but

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
that I'll have to be more accurate but

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.150 
that I'll have to be more accurate but
if<00:00:45.690> you're<00:00:45.840> not<00:00:45.930> using<00:00:46.170> the<00:00:46.440> adjustable<00:00:46.860> stock

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
if you're not using the adjustable stock

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.850 
if you're not using the adjustable stock
which<00:00:48.149> is<00:00:48.390> essentially<00:00:48.870> stalker<00:00:49.200> than<00:00:49.620> being

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
which is essentially stalker than being

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.610 
which is essentially stalker than being
accurate<00:00:50.539> ultimately<00:00:51.539> becomes<00:00:52.079> a<00:00:52.289> little<00:00:52.440> bit

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
accurate ultimately becomes a little bit

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.549 
accurate ultimately becomes a little bit
easier<00:00:53.600> straight<00:00:54.600> away<00:00:54.719> just<00:00:55.079> because<00:00:55.199> you're

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
easier straight away just because you're

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:56.990 
easier straight away just because you're
not<00:00:55.680> moving<00:00:55.949> as<00:00:56.010> much<00:00:56.219> I<00:00:56.489> thought<00:00:56.850> I<00:00:56.910> heard

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
not moving as much I thought I heard

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.340 
not moving as much I thought I heard
someone<00:00:57.420> that<00:00:58.230> is<00:00:58.350> so<00:00:58.590> bad<00:00:59.750> really<00:01:00.750> okay<00:01:01.140> well

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
someone that is so bad really okay well

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.179 
someone that is so bad really okay well
regardless<00:01:02.600> regardless<00:01:03.799> no<00:01:04.799> I<00:01:04.830> don't<00:01:04.979> want<00:01:05.100> to

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
regardless regardless no I don't want to

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.370 
regardless regardless no I don't want to
run<00:01:05.939> in<00:01:06.090> there<00:01:06.360> just<00:01:06.540> because<00:01:06.720> I'll<00:01:06.960> get<00:01:07.080> taken

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
run in there just because I'll get taken

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.760 
run in there just because I'll get taken
out<00:01:07.470> if<00:01:07.619> I<00:01:07.680> do<00:01:07.799> that<00:01:09.020> yeah<00:01:10.020> little<00:01:10.500> corner

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
out if I do that yeah little corner

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.050 
out if I do that yeah little corner
camper<00:01:11.630> thought<00:01:12.630> so<00:01:13.400> people<00:01:14.400> always<00:01:14.549> seem<00:01:14.820> use

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
camper thought so people always seem use

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.899 
camper thought so people always seem use
the<00:01:15.180> exact<00:01:15.450> same<00:01:15.479> spots<00:01:16.080> like<00:01:16.350> over<00:01:16.799> and<00:01:17.070> over

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
the exact same spots like over and over

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:22.510 
the exact same spots like over and over
and<00:01:18.390> over<00:01:19.080> again<00:01:19.470> and<00:01:20.250> it<00:01:21.090> doesn't<00:01:21.479> work

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:22.520 
and over again and it doesn't work

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:24.950 
and over again and it doesn't work
doesn't<00:01:23.520> work<00:01:23.820> like<00:01:24.060> that<00:01:24.119> although<00:01:24.840> I'm

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
doesn't work like that although I'm

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.270 
doesn't work like that although I'm
doing<00:01:25.200> the<00:01:25.290> exact<00:01:25.500> same<00:01:25.530> thing<00:01:25.950> as<00:01:26.070> well

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
doing the exact same thing as well

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.999 
doing the exact same thing as well
weights<00:01:27.259> crosshair<00:01:28.259> was<00:01:28.380> acting<00:01:28.680> weird<00:01:28.829> it's

this<00:01:40.020> game<00:01:40.259> is<00:01:40.409> a<00:01:40.439> lot<00:01:40.500> more<00:01:40.619> powerful<00:01:41.899> than<00:01:42.899> in

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
this game is a lot more powerful than in

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.499 
this game is a lot more powerful than in
that<00:01:43.320> game<00:01:43.729> then<00:01:44.729> again<00:01:44.850> killing<00:01:45.299> a<00:01:45.360> person

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
that game then again killing a person

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:50.840 
that game then again killing a person
takes<00:01:45.869> more<00:01:46.170> than<00:01:47.299> 150<00:01:48.299> milliseconds<00:01:49.850> so
