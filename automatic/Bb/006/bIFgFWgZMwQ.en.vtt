mathematician<00:00:44.780> um<00:00:45.780> but<00:00:46.770> that<00:00:47.520> wasn't<00:00:47.730> the

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
mathematician um but that wasn't the

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.630 
mathematician um but that wasn't the
whole<00:00:47.969> idea<00:00:48.239> of<00:00:48.480> this<00:00:48.770> so<00:00:49.770> basically<00:00:50.399> the

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
whole idea of this so basically the

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:30.780 
Talia and her family to have to

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:33.439 
Talia and her family to have to
contemplate<00:04:31.199> the<00:04:31.770> idea<00:04:31.800> that<00:04:32.280> she<00:04:33.090> might<00:04:33.240> have

00:04:33.439 --> 00:04:33.449 
contemplate the idea that she might have

00:04:33.449 --> 00:04:37.610 
contemplate the idea that she might have
to<00:04:33.599> have<00:04:33.720> a<00:04:33.780> leg<00:04:34.770> amputated<00:04:34.949> or<00:04:35.759> she<00:04:36.720> would

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:37.620 
to have a leg amputated or she would

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:39.589 
to have a leg amputated or she would
basically<00:04:37.800> be<00:04:38.130> bedridden<00:04:38.520> because<00:04:39.180> she<00:04:39.360> can't

00:04:39.589 --> 00:04:39.599 
basically be bedridden because she can't

00:04:39.599 --> 00:04:41.450 
basically be bedridden because she can't
walk<00:04:39.840> a<00:04:39.900> couple<00:04:40.169> of<00:04:40.440> meters<00:04:40.800> without<00:04:41.069> immense
