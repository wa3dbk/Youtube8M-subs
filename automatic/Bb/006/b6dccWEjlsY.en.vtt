set idea of it as being almost an
Italian<00:00:11.269> virus<00:00:11.719> I<00:00:11.990> think<00:00:12.530> it's<00:00:12.679> a<00:00:12.769> much<00:00:12.950> darker

00:00:13.209 --> 00:00:13.219

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:17.470 
I think it's a play about grief and loss

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:20.470 
I think it's a play about grief and loss
more<00:00:18.470> than<00:00:18.529> it<00:00:18.800> is<00:00:18.830> a<00:00:19.039> play<00:00:19.369> about<00:00:19.490> funny<00:00:20.119> twins

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:20.480 
more than it is a play about funny twins

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:22.480 
more than it is a play about funny twins
it<00:00:21.109> was<00:00:21.230> quite<00:00:21.349> an<00:00:21.439> early<00:00:21.529> decision<00:00:21.920> that<00:00:22.310> I

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:22.490 
it was quite an early decision that I

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:23.950 
it was quite an early decision that I
wouldn't<00:00:22.820> direct<00:00:23.060> all<00:00:23.180> three<00:00:23.420> partly<00:00:23.810> cuz<00:00:23.930> I

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:23.960 
wouldn't direct all three partly cuz I

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:25.480 
wouldn't direct all three partly cuz I
just<00:00:24.109> thought<00:00:24.170> it'd<00:00:24.289> be<00:00:24.320> vain<00:00:24.619> to<00:00:24.980> do<00:00:25.099> so<00:00:25.250> and

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:25.490 
just thought it'd be vain to do so and

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:27.970 
just thought it'd be vain to do so and
partly<00:00:26.179> because<00:00:26.420> I<00:00:27.019> wanted<00:00:27.439> an<00:00:27.560> another

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:27.980 
partly because I wanted an another
