so it runs on 110 and I got a little
thermostat<00:03:12.519> there<00:03:16.890> turn<00:03:17.890> this<00:03:18.070> on<00:03:18.340> we'll<00:03:18.609> see

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:18.760 
thermostat there turn this on we'll see

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:37.040 
thermostat there turn this on we'll see
what<00:03:18.880> happens

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:37.050 

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:43.280 

does<00:03:37.410> it<00:03:37.560> need<00:03:37.650> a<00:03:37.710> compressor

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:43.290 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:48.210 

105<00:03:44.290> psi

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:48.220 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:51.870 

fired<00:03:48.850> off<00:03:49.800> green<00:03:50.800> light<00:03:51.040> there<00:03:51.280> tells<00:03:51.580> me<00:03:51.820> I

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:51.880 
fired off green light there tells me I

00:03:51.880 --> 00:04:01.220

there<00:04:01.590> we<00:04:01.650> go

00:04:12.309 --> 00:04:12.319 

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:16.840 

now<00:04:12.859> the<00:04:12.920> auxiliary<00:04:13.579> fan<00:04:13.909> turned<00:04:14.299> on

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:16.850 

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:23.090 

now<00:04:17.850> there's<00:04:18.979> air<00:04:19.979> come<00:04:20.280> out<00:04:20.489> of<00:04:20.639> these<00:04:22.100> events

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:23.100 
now there's air come out of these events

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:30.439 
now there's air come out of these events
here

00:04:30.439 --> 00:04:30.449 

00:04:30.449 --> 00:04:32.299
