00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
tried to get it before we ran into

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:16.399 
tried to get it before we ran into
lappers<00:01:15.750> and<00:01:15.900> the<00:01:15.960> track<00:01:16.170> really

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
lappers and the track really

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.800 
lappers and the track really
deteriorated<00:01:17.159> and<00:01:18.000> I<00:01:18.119> was<00:01:18.270> able<00:01:18.360> to<00:01:18.540> do<00:01:18.659> that

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
deteriorated and I was able to do that

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.240 
deteriorated and I was able to do that
and<00:01:18.990> once<00:01:19.229> Ryan<00:01:19.439> got<00:01:19.590> in<00:01:19.710> a<00:01:19.740> second<00:01:20.040> I<00:01:20.100> made<00:01:20.220> a

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
and once Ryan got in a second I made a

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.940 
and once Ryan got in a second I made a
few<00:01:20.580> mistakes<00:01:20.790> and<00:01:21.240> and<00:01:21.390> I<00:01:22.140> think<00:01:22.740> he<00:01:22.799> was<00:01:22.890> a
