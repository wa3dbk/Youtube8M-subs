but<00:01:05.820> the<00:01:05.939> image<00:01:06.270> above<00:01:06.420> suggests<00:01:06.810> that<00:01:07.439> the

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
but the image above suggests that the

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.100 
but the image above suggests that the

there is also no depth sensor on the

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.600 
there is also no depth sensor on the
device<00:01:12.930> so<00:01:13.320> it's<00:01:13.470> very<00:01:13.560> likely<00:01:13.680> that<00:01:14.100> HTC

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610
