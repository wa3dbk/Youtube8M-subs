00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
medium-high should work you're probably

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:15.610 
medium-high should work you're probably
going<00:03:12.780> to<00:03:12.870> pour<00:03:13.200> about<00:03:13.970> around<00:03:14.970> a<00:03:15.030> quarter<00:03:15.329> cup

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:15.620

into<00:03:16.620> the<00:03:16.709> pan<00:03:16.980> and<00:03:17.400> then<00:03:18.000> you<00:03:18.120> need<00:03:18.329> to<00:03:18.510> swirl

00:03:19.309 --> 00:03:19.319 
into the pan and then you need to swirl

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:21.319 
into the pan and then you need to swirl
the<00:03:19.739> batter<00:03:19.920> around<00:03:20.459> it's<00:03:20.880> okay<00:03:21.150> if<00:03:21.180> you<00:03:21.299> have

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:21.329 
the batter around it's okay if you have

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:25.400 
the batter around it's okay if you have
a<00:03:21.450> few<00:03:22.410> little<00:03:22.560> things<00:03:23.690> on<00:03:24.690> the<00:03:24.780> side<00:03:24.989> makes<00:03:25.290> it

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:25.410 
a few little things on the side makes it

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:26.390 
a few little things on the side makes it
easier<00:03:25.680> to<00:03:25.739> flip<00:03:25.950> it<00:03:26.010> over<00:03:26.220> because

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 
easier to flip it over because

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:30.949 
easier to flip it over because
oftentimes<00:03:26.819> I<00:03:27.120> use<00:03:27.329> my<00:03:28.730> hand<00:03:29.730> you<00:03:30.599> can<00:03:30.780> tell

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:30.959 
oftentimes I use my hand you can tell

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:32.900 
oftentimes I use my hand you can tell
when<00:03:31.079> it's<00:03:31.230> starting<00:03:31.590> to<00:03:31.680> get<00:03:31.769> done<00:03:32.040> by<00:03:32.849> the

00:03:35.839 --> 00:03:35.849 
sides they are going to get kind of curl

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:39.210
