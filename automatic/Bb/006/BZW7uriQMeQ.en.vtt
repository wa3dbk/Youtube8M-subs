automatically harvest it and then you

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:31.939 
automatically harvest it and then you
make<00:00:31.109> bread<00:00:31.380> out<00:00:31.560> of<00:00:31.679> it

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
bread okay so this is a familiar concept

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:37.819 
bread okay so this is a familiar concept
here

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
here

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:39.799 
here
I<00:00:37.860> think<00:00:38.820> it's<00:00:38.969> flown<00:00:39.210> around<00:00:39.540> on<00:00:39.690> the

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
I think it's flown around on the

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:43.209 
I think it's flown around on the
internet<00:00:40.170> you<00:00:40.320> use<00:00:40.469> water<00:00:40.879> to<00:00:41.879> harvest<00:00:42.360> your

00:00:43.209 --> 00:00:43.219 
internet you use water to harvest your

00:00:43.219 --> 00:00:46.190 
internet you use water to harvest your
your<00:00:44.219> wheat<00:00:44.489> so<00:00:45.329> that<00:00:45.510> you<00:00:45.629> don't<00:00:45.780> have<00:00:45.989> to

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
your wheat so that you don't have to

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.900 
your wheat so that you don't have to
plow<00:00:46.500> it<00:00:46.680> again<00:00:46.920> you<00:00:47.070> don't<00:00:47.160> have<00:00:47.280> to<00:00:47.399> hoe<00:00:47.760> it

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
plow it again you don't have to hoe it

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:53.479 
plow it again you don't have to hoe it
again<00:00:48.200> so<00:00:50.120> this<00:00:51.120> is<00:00:51.180> how<00:00:51.449> I<00:00:51.480> do<00:00:51.629> it<00:00:51.840> up<00:00:52.800> here<00:00:53.280> I

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
again so this is how I do it up here I

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.750 
again so this is how I do it up here I
have<00:00:53.670> water<00:00:54.350> which<00:00:55.350> is<00:00:55.379> stopped<00:00:55.860> up<00:00:56.100> at<00:00:56.579> the

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
have water which is stopped up at the

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.319 
have water which is stopped up at the
moment<00:00:56.940> by<00:00:57.360> the<00:00:57.390> by<00:00:58.230> these<00:00:58.440> pistons<00:00:58.980> I<00:00:59.329> have

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
moment by the by these pistons I have

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.130 
moment by the by these pistons I have
some<00:01:01.010> redstone<00:01:02.010> wired<00:01:02.640> up<00:01:02.879> if<00:01:03.570> I<00:01:03.690> flip<00:01:03.989> this

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
some redstone wired up if I flip this

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.219 
some redstone wired up if I flip this
switch<00:01:04.680> right<00:01:05.070> here<00:01:05.630> water<00:01:06.630> is<00:01:06.810> gonna<00:01:06.960> come

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
switch right here water is gonna come

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:10.810 
switch right here water is gonna come
down<00:01:07.369> and<00:01:08.369> then<00:01:08.490> it's<00:01:08.670> gonna<00:01:08.760> wash<00:01:09.119> over<00:01:09.680> the

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:10.820 
down and then it's gonna wash over the

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:15.050 
down and then it's gonna wash over the
you<00:01:11.820> know<00:01:11.939> any<00:01:12.210> any<00:01:13.080> wheat<00:01:13.680> over<00:01:13.979> to<00:01:14.430> this<00:01:14.580> side

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
you know any any wheat over to this side

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.770 
you know any any wheat over to this side
so<00:01:16.369> the<00:01:17.369> other<00:01:17.520> only<00:01:18.060> other<00:01:18.210> things<00:01:18.479> that<00:01:18.689> you

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
so the other only other things that you

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.780 
so the other only other things that you
want<00:01:18.960> to<00:01:19.020> do<00:01:19.229> now<00:01:19.470> is<00:01:19.680> to<00:01:19.890> have<00:01:20.130> some<00:01:20.490> sort<00:01:20.729> of

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
want to do now is to have some sort of

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:26.300 
want to do now is to have some sort of
water<00:01:21.030> that<00:01:21.390> flows<00:01:22.040> the<00:01:24.619> the<00:01:25.619> product<00:01:26.070> down

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
water that flows the the product down

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.390 
water that flows the the product down
here<00:01:26.700> so<00:01:26.909> that<00:01:27.060> it<00:01:27.180> can<00:01:27.210> be<00:01:27.479> sucked<00:01:27.840> up<00:01:27.990> by<00:01:28.049> this

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:28.400 
here so that it can be sucked up by this

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:32.630 
here so that it can be sucked up by this
obsidian<00:01:29.400> pipe<00:01:29.850> and<00:01:30.380> then<00:01:31.380> going<00:01:31.920> into<00:01:32.400> your

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
obsidian pipe and then going into your

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:38.090 
obsidian pipe and then going into your
other<00:01:33.560> part<00:01:34.560> of<00:01:34.680> the<00:01:34.829> of<00:01:35.130> the<00:01:36.950> mechanism<00:01:37.950> here

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
other part of the of the mechanism here

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:44.389 
other part of the of the mechanism here
too<00:01:38.340> to<00:01:39.000> make<00:01:39.450> your<00:01:39.630> bread<00:01:40.340> alright<00:01:41.340> so<00:01:43.399> the

too to make your bread alright so the
way<00:01:44.430> that<00:01:44.700> I<00:01:44.729> do<00:01:44.850> it<00:01:45.000> is<00:01:45.509> I<00:01:46.170> have<00:01:46.829> two<00:01:47.450> water

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
way that I do it is I have two water

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.719 
way that I do it is I have two water
source<00:01:48.840> blocks<00:01:49.290> here<00:01:49.619> I'm<00:01:50.189> gonna<00:01:50.340> place<00:01:50.610> them

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
source blocks here I'm gonna place them

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:53.200 
source blocks here I'm gonna place them
right<00:01:50.909> here

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:53.210 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:55.940 

as<00:01:54.210> you<00:01:54.360> can<00:01:54.480> see<00:01:54.720> the<00:01:55.110> water<00:01:55.350> is<00:01:55.470> gonna<00:01:55.680> flow

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
as you can see the water is gonna flow

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.300 
as you can see the water is gonna flow
down<00:01:56.690> so<00:01:57.690> when<00:01:58.140> the<00:01:58.260> wheat<00:01:58.440> drops<00:01:58.830> into<00:01:59.160> the

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
down so when the wheat drops into the

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.520 
down so when the wheat drops into the
water<00:01:59.640> is<00:01:59.790> gonna<00:02:00.060> get<00:02:00.270> it's<00:02:00.930> gonna<00:02:01.020> flow<00:02:01.320> down

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
water is gonna get it's gonna flow down

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:06.200 
water is gonna get it's gonna flow down
this<00:02:01.770> way<00:02:02.000> all<00:02:03.000> right<00:02:03.200> so<00:02:04.700> let<00:02:05.700> you<00:02:05.850> speed<00:02:06.090> up

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
this way all right so let you speed up

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.740 
this way all right so let you speed up
the<00:02:06.330> process<00:02:06.750> a<00:02:06.780> little<00:02:06.990> bit<00:02:07.140> I'm<00:02:07.470> going<00:02:07.680> to

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:08.750

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:00.320 
collect it down here I'm going to turn
on<00:02:56.820> this<00:02:56.940> engine<00:02:57.950> to<00:02:58.950> make<00:02:59.100> it<00:02:59.280> suck<00:02:59.970> in<00:03:00.150> there

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:00.330 
on this engine to make it suck in there

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:07.160 
on this engine to make it suck in there
a<00:03:00.360> little<00:03:00.480> bit<00:03:00.600> faster<00:03:02.630> alright<00:03:05.690> so<00:03:06.690> both<00:03:06.990> the

a little bit faster alright so both the

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:10.990 
a little bit faster alright so both the
wheat<00:03:07.350> and<00:03:07.380> the<00:03:07.620> seed<00:03:07.920> are<00:03:08.220> gonna<00:03:08.340> flow<00:03:09.230> here
