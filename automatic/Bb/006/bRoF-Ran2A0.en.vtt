still it's uh I got what the hell's are
called<00:02:23.260> steady<00:02:23.680> aim<00:02:23.940> that's<00:02:24.940> why<00:02:25.120> I'm<00:02:25.299> able<00:02:25.540> to

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:25.690 
called steady aim that's why I'm able to

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:28.229 
called steady aim that's why I'm able to
spray<00:02:26.290> people<00:02:26.799> from<00:02:27.069> a<00:02:27.280> distance<00:02:27.879> with<00:02:28.090> these

00:02:28.229 --> 00:02:28.239 
spray people from a distance with these

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:32.610 
spray people from a distance with these
things<00:02:29.610> but<00:02:30.610> yeah<00:02:31.450> first<00:02:31.900> impressions<00:02:32.110> and

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.620 
things but yeah first impressions and

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:35.339 
things but yeah first impressions and
that's<00:02:33.099> all<00:02:33.220> I<00:02:33.280> can<00:02:33.459> say<00:02:33.640> right<00:02:33.670> now<00:02:34.230> it's<00:02:35.230> just

00:02:35.339 --> 00:02:35.349 
that's all I can say right now it's just

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:37.229 
that's all I can say right now it's just
it's<00:02:35.620> hard<00:02:35.680> this<00:02:36.159> the<00:02:36.519> lobby<00:02:36.730> we<00:02:36.909> got<00:02:37.090> in<00:02:37.209> here

00:02:37.229 --> 00:02:37.239 
it's hard this the lobby we got in here

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:41.280 
it's hard this the lobby we got in here
it<00:02:37.629> was<00:02:37.780> pretty<00:02:38.379> good<00:02:38.530> actually<00:02:38.739> but<00:02:40.290> most

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.290 
it was pretty good actually but most

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:43.020 
it was pretty good actually but most
lobbies<00:02:41.650> I've<00:02:41.799> been<00:02:41.950> getting<00:02:42.220> into<00:02:42.340> it's<00:02:42.760> just

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:43.030 
lobbies I've been getting into it's just

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:45.839 
lobbies I've been getting into it's just
ghost<00:02:43.360> camping<00:02:43.930> everywhere<00:02:44.620> like<00:02:44.950> at<00:02:45.489> least

00:02:45.839 --> 00:02:45.849 
ghost camping everywhere like at least

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:47.369 
ghost camping everywhere like at least
half<00:02:46.239> of<00:02:46.390> the<00:02:46.480> team<00:02:46.660> would<00:02:46.840> have<00:02:46.870> ghost<00:02:47.170> on

00:02:47.369 --> 00:02:47.379 
half of the team would have ghost on

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:49.830 
half of the team would have ghost on
just<00:02:47.590> hiding<00:02:47.980> somewhere<00:02:48.519> waiting<00:02:49.359> for<00:02:49.660> people

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840 
just hiding somewhere waiting for people

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:51.569 
just hiding somewhere waiting for people
to<00:02:49.870> run<00:02:50.049> by<00:02:50.230> because<00:02:50.769> you<00:02:51.099> know<00:02:51.220> that's<00:02:51.459> how

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:51.579 
to run by because you know that's how

00:02:51.579 --> 00:02:53.069 
to run by because you know that's how
you<00:02:51.609> learn<00:02:51.879> the<00:02:52.090> new<00:02:52.209> map<00:02:52.420> of<00:02:52.599> course<00:02:52.840> is

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:53.079 
you learn the new map of course is

00:02:53.079 --> 00:02:55.770 
you learn the new map of course is
sitting<00:02:53.379> in<00:02:53.440> a<00:02:53.530> corner<00:02:54.120> it's<00:02:55.120> not<00:02:55.329> actually

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:55.780 
sitting in a corner it's not actually

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:57.210 
sitting in a corner it's not actually
running<00:02:56.019> around<00:02:56.319> the<00:02:56.410> map<00:02:56.590> trying<00:02:56.920> to<00:02:56.980> see

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:57.220 
running around the map trying to see

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:59.190 
running around the map trying to see
where<00:02:57.400> everything<00:02:57.609> is<00:02:57.940> on<00:02:58.150> the<00:02:58.239> map<00:02:58.390> no<00:02:58.659> no<00:02:58.810> the

00:02:59.190 --> 00:02:59.200 
where everything is on the map no no the

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:01.830 
where everything is on the map no no the
way<00:02:59.290> you<00:02:59.349> learn<00:02:59.650> the<00:02:59.799> map<00:02:59.950> I<00:03:00.099> guess<00:03:00.280> is<00:03:00.579> to<00:03:00.840> sit

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:01.840 
way you learn the map I guess is to sit

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:04.140 
way you learn the map I guess is to sit
in<00:03:02.019> a<00:03:02.170> corner<00:03:02.560> with<00:03:03.010> either<00:03:03.250> a<00:03:03.400> claymore<00:03:03.909> or<00:03:04.120> a

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:04.150 
in a corner with either a claymore or a

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:07.259 
in a corner with either a claymore or a
motion<00:03:04.599> sensor<00:03:04.750> beside<00:03:05.290> you<00:03:06.180> you<00:03:07.180> know

00:03:07.259 --> 00:03:07.269 
motion sensor beside you you know

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:08.990 
motion sensor beside you you know
because<00:03:07.510> that's<00:03:07.659> how<00:03:07.780> I<00:03:07.810> learned<00:03:08.079> my<00:03:08.260> maps<00:03:08.500> do

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 
because that's how I learned my maps do

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.860 
because that's how I learned my maps do
regardless<00:03:10.000> i'm<00:03:10.180> not<00:03:10.329> going<00:03:10.450> to<00:03:10.480> rant<00:03:10.720> about

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:10.870 
regardless i'm not going to rant about

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:15.010 
time I new map pack comes over anyways

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:18.990 
time I new map pack comes over anyways
so<00:03:16.200> shit<00:03:17.200> happens<00:03:17.349> I'll<00:03:18.310> get<00:03:18.519> on<00:03:18.669> with<00:03:18.849> my<00:03:18.970> life
