00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:03.489
 you have to treat them because it will be very good 

00:00:02.110 --> 00:00:05.470
 the present day 

00:00:03.489 --> 00:00:06.700
 video comment this occasion we are going to 

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:10.870
 talk about how to put the title of what 

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:12.459
 would be what my future would be 

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:14.019
 channel lately lords since 

00:00:12.459 --> 00:00:16.570
 he left origins and crossed from before 

00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:18.550
 a lot of people in it seems that they are 

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:20.199
 more concerned than I go it seems that his 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:22.090
 channel it seems that his life I have no idea 

00:00:20.199 --> 00:00:23.589
 Tell me what are you going to do with your channel 

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:26.919
 there are no longer shadows, you no longer have 

00:00:23.589 --> 00:00:28.179
 upload what's going to happen I do not know but 

00:00:26.919 --> 00:00:30.770
 because people care so much about 

00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:32.660
 this is coming is not worth pure cock 

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:34.070
 Look, gentlemen, first of all they have to 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:35.840
 be clear what is youtube for me 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:40.670
 obviously youtube is what you spent 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:43.160
 a lot of time of my day and it's a hobby 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:45.800
 really but nothing more is a hobby not 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:47.600
 it's a job and well let's say this 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:49.400
 hobby this this way 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.230
 entertainment because it has as its 

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:54.410
 very active moments your moments 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:57.230
 Calm your moments of relaxation 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:59.090
 and for example obviously black ops 1 and 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:01.880
 black ops 2 fun very active moments 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:03.410
 this female built I started the world and 

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:05.570
 from Black Ops 2 since it from 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:07.190
 that was damn from even from arts 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:09.950
 glosses of the first of May that would be the 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:11.630
 first trailer of the campaign that to 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:14.210
 part of the game on May 3 that went to 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:16.670
 the nightly sale the one that was I think the 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:19.250
 November 12, that is, was, was, was time 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:21.890
 in which I was very active so much for 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:23.509
 news as per maps all that and now 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:24.979
 it has come to an end however this is not what 

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:26.930
 I see it as something bad for me I do not see it 

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:28.369
 I speak as I'll upload it 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:31.070
 will see people people get bored 

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:33.410
 you know subscribe I'm going to lose views is not 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:34.970
 something that sees it that way I more than 

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:38.090
 nothing I see it as a rest then as 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:41.450
 a period of huawei is over basic 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:43.250
 What the fuck today finally finally over 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:44.810
 no longer see more pressures will no longer see 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:46.369
 what this video uploaded is no longer going to see 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:47.990
 what goes up list herediano valverde that 

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:51.590
 align yourself with this 9 green footprint that this 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:54.619
 video dya it's like it's over it came 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:57.500
 calm peace came to stop breastfeeding is 

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:58.670
 stop breastfeeding and it really makes me happy 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:00.630
 will be happy I feel that this is a 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:02.820
 weather 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.939
 since rest break is the word 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:06.659
 for all youtubers sounders in 

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:08.459
 times from which you can relax 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:10.080
 can do whatever they want you can upload 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:11.849
 whatever they want or at least I think 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.830
 I say I know that if I go up I do not know 

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:15.000
 any other game even a single 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.620
 chapter because although he finished the 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.849
 series I know it was nice many people 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:19.590
 is going to see it but as I say this is a 

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:21.480
 hobby is not a job is not that I 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:23.400
 matter a lot if a thousand people see me 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.780
 100 thousand people see me at the end of 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.730
 accounts I do it with the same purpose 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:28.050
 to entertain myself and spend my time 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:30.180
 in this since it's something that I like 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:31.920
 so it's not like I really 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:34.080
 amount that I no longer get more people or 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:35.700
 that people are leaving me or that I no longer have 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:37.830
 so many views or that it does not generate as much 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:41.459
 money is not something that really 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:44.489
 mortifies since it is simply a hobby 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:46.500
 and now what am I going to do in the future 

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:47.730
 I know the goal I do not know how you can see 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.019
 this week is quite inactive 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:52.440
 been like more enjoying my 

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:53.970
 free time in pendejadas this or better 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:55.530
 said I was not mortified so much 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:56.970
 for making a video that record this that 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:59.099
 record the comment that upload the video 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:01.410
 that such channels like I'm already a 

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:04.410
 little dedicating me more as I said 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:06.359
 at rest relaxation and that's why 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:07.560
 that worries us so much and then that 

00:03:06.359 --> 00:03:09.720
 I can go up obviously 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:12.630
 and all of you is something obvious I'm going to 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:15.390
 upload I'm going to be in the moment I have 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:17.069
 to upload something that I can not upload is not 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:18.569
 just like your voice different games now 

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:20.310
 do not believe that by saying different games 

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:21.870
 I mean upload series or how to 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:23.370
 Completely fulfill a game because 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:24.690
 they know how I am they know that I am from the 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:27.390
 people that I am a chapter and never 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:28.739
 will end this series whore but what 

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:30.120
 I go is that it is not something that worries me 

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:32.370
 the mind I will keep climbing zombies 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:34.170
 in my equal and I keep going up some 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:36.690
 theories and is that there is still something for 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:39.450
 clarify this I am already preparing some 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:42.720
 top 5 for the future whether you want 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:44.100
 several things to do this seems to me 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:46.230
 perfect to come this year from 

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:48.319
 relaxation for me called depression to 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:50.670
 calls you to wake up for the times 

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:52.080
 obviously has its good side them 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:54.299
 exploits to its bad side that it is 

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:55.620
 a lot of pressure then I feel like it's coming 

00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:58.019
 well this year of rest is good 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:59.220
 before and I no longer worry about the future 

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:01.110
 from my channel, gentlemen, you, either 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:03.480
 they must do it because it really is 

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:06.420
 simply a means of entertainment 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:08.340
 virtual and it 's just that this 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:10.230
 So, if it is simply for 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:13.170
 know that I am going to climb because you are going to climb 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:14.400
 the same thing they want me to upload that they are 

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:17.100
 my is no longer active 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:20.070
 that has already gone out of style and even 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:21.540
 be without six or five or six years 

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:24.630
 then there are people who keep going up 

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:26.759
 ward war street is war you eat one 

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:28.860
 two whites is not over and 

00:04:26.759 --> 00:04:30.870
 still not finished even in a year 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:33.020
 cause the next title and not in two 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:35.310
 years we will see seven titles and in addition 

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:38.490
 this has already finished zombies 

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:40.410
 completely to remain being going 

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:42.660
 to keep being thing it seemed like that 

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:43.800
 of the moment even many years ahead 

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:46.770
 will continue to be thing the moment well 

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:48.120
 like old games from 10 15 years ago 

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:50.280
 they keep going up today because it's going to 

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:52.020
 to be exactly the same there is no reason to 

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:53.490
 worry a reason to say u and if to me 

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:55.979
 are my houses closed true not 

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:57.570
 it mattered my mother who is going people 

00:04:55.979 --> 00:04:59.400
 comes if people see you is because they 

00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:01.650
 like how you comment if people leave you 

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:03.570
 to see is because he does not want to see you and 

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:05.880
 but I will not go there and not go na 

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:07.530
 numbers below the video really not 

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:09.389
 it's something that changes and it's something that 

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:10.470
 people have to understand more than anything 

00:05:09.389 --> 00:05:12.240
 the youtubers that are worrying 

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:13.860
 a lot for its channels and the people who 

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:16.139
 they are worrying a lot about their 

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:18.240
 youtubers favorites this but yes 

00:05:16.139 --> 00:05:19.979
 more than anything it would be these gentlemen this one 

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:22.020
 it's not going to change much the mechanics of 

00:05:19.979 --> 00:05:24.720
 channel will continue to be the call of duty 

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:27.780
 of some saving of series of a 

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:29.099
 chapter nothing more and then yes it would be more 

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:30.419
 that nothing all this simply wanted 

00:05:29.099 --> 00:05:31.979
 make clear to them what it is that you think 

00:05:30.419 --> 00:05:34.169
 this year I see it more as a break 

00:05:31.979 --> 00:05:35.699
 that as something bad for my channel but 

00:05:34.169 --> 00:05:37.500
 well no sir that would be all I hope that 

00:05:35.699 --> 00:05:40.669
 liked this video 15 much we're going 

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:40.669
 then goodbye
