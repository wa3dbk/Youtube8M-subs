so<00:02:43.019> he<00:02:43.140> gets<00:02:43.290> to<00:02:43.349> take<00:02:43.530> radiant<00:02:43.920> and<00:02:44.280> then

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:44.459 
so he gets to take radiant and then

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:45.949 
so he gets to take radiant and then
slinger<00:02:45.000> goes<00:02:45.150> into<00:02:45.359> the<00:02:45.450> red<00:02:45.569> green<00:02:45.750> decker
