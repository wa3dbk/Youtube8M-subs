 scalded in water to remove the peel 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:58.340
 and I put it here with a little bit of oil it is 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:02.430
 a bit of parsley salt 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:04.290
 Here I have some shallot into small pieces 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:08.430
 of the leaves of celery two 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:12.299

 white pepper salt oil and 2 tablespoons of 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:26.180

 I put the chilli into the shallots 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:45.950

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:51.140
 extra oil a couple of spoons I cover with 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:54.409
 magic cooker I leave on high and 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:56.899
 I fry for a minute and put 

00:01:54.409 --> 00:02:00.819
 let's see the promotion 

00:01:56.899 --> 00:02:00.819

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:40.889

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:00.769
 little bit of salt 

00:03:01.219 --> 00:03:07.349
 not much is said because after there is the 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:09.359
 soy sauce so we keep a 

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:13.169
 little with salt and then we can 

00:03:09.359 --> 00:03:24.030
 always adjust the flame after another 

00:03:13.169 --> 00:03:30.120

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:32.269
 white and sieve these two tablespoons of 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:32.269

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:36.340

00:04:37.669 --> 00:04:43.450
