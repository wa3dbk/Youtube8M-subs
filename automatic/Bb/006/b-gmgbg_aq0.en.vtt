00:00:36.549 --> 00:00:36.559 
chin and sagging jowls I guess I'm just

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:38.080 
chin and sagging jowls I guess I'm just
finding<00:00:36.829> out<00:00:37.100> that<00:00:37.250> I'm<00:00:37.370> getting<00:00:37.550> a<00:00:37.610> bit<00:00:37.760> older

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:38.090 
finding out that I'm getting a bit older

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:40.360 
finding out that I'm getting a bit older
that<00:00:38.120> I'm<00:00:38.300> kind<00:00:38.750> of<00:00:38.780> losing<00:00:39.559> tone<00:00:39.829> through<00:00:40.190> the

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:40.370 
that I'm kind of losing tone through the

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:42.910 
that I'm kind of losing tone through the
the<00:00:40.790> jaw<00:00:41.030> line<00:00:41.239> so<00:00:41.960> I<00:00:41.989> think<00:00:42.559> it's<00:00:42.739> something

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:42.920 
the jaw line so I think it's something

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:44.530 
the jaw line so I think it's something
that's<00:00:43.070> that<00:00:43.280> is<00:00:43.580> genetic<00:00:44.089> and<00:00:44.180> has<00:00:44.360> always

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:44.540 
that's that is genetic and has always

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:47.680 
that's that is genetic and has always
kind<00:00:44.960> of<00:00:44.989> been<00:00:45.339> as<00:00:46.339> a<00:00:46.400> problem<00:00:47.000> area<00:00:47.269> for<00:00:47.540> me

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:47.690 
kind of been as a problem area for me

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:52.030 
kind of been as a problem area for me
and<00:00:47.960> so<00:00:48.680> I<00:00:48.710> think<00:00:49.269> you<00:00:50.269> know<00:00:50.589> now<00:00:51.589> that<00:00:51.620> I'm

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:52.040 
and so I think you know now that I'm

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:53.649 
and so I think you know now that I'm
getting<00:00:52.250> older<00:00:52.579> it's<00:00:52.730> even<00:00:52.909> more<00:00:53.059> obvious<00:00:53.360> so

00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:53.659 
getting older it's even more obvious so

00:00:53.659 --> 00:00:55.750 
getting older it's even more obvious so
anything<00:00:54.589> that<00:00:54.710> I<00:00:54.769> can<00:00:54.890> kind<00:00:55.070> of<00:00:55.159> firm<00:00:55.430> up<00:00:55.640> this

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:55.760 
anything that I can kind of firm up this

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:58.450 
anything that I can kind of firm up this
whole<00:00:55.970> jaw<00:00:56.210> area<00:00:56.659> and<00:00:56.839> lift<00:00:57.140> under<00:00:58.070> my<00:00:58.190> chin

00:00:58.450 --> 00:00:58.460 
whole jaw area and lift under my chin

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:01.479 
whole jaw area and lift under my chin
I'd<00:00:58.729> be<00:00:59.000> you<00:00:59.299> know<00:00:59.420> really<00:00:59.659> excited<00:01:00.489> working

I'd be you know really excited working

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:03.520 
I'd be you know really excited working
mom<00:01:01.670> Danielle<00:01:02.119> doesn't<00:01:02.420> want<00:01:02.750> surgery<00:01:03.229> I

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:03.530 
mom Danielle doesn't want surgery I

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:05.859 
mom Danielle doesn't want surgery I
don't<00:01:03.830> believe<00:01:04.129> in<00:01:04.280> surgery<00:01:04.729> so<00:01:05.030> I<00:01:05.360> guess<00:01:05.689> I've

00:01:05.859 --> 00:01:05.869 
don't believe in surgery so I guess I've

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:07.359 
don't believe in surgery so I guess I've
been<00:01:05.900> looking<00:01:06.320> around<00:01:06.409> for<00:01:06.710> something<00:01:07.159> that

00:01:07.359 --> 00:01:07.369 
been looking around for something that

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:10.480 
been looking around for something that
was<00:01:07.520> going<00:01:07.850> to<00:01:08.119> make<00:01:08.869> me<00:01:09.080> look<00:01:09.590> a<00:01:09.740> little<00:01:10.310> bit

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:10.490 
was going to make me look a little bit

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:12.039 
was going to make me look a little bit
fresher<00:01:10.729> feel<00:01:11.150> a<00:01:11.180> little<00:01:11.299> bit<00:01:11.420> more<00:01:11.479> confident

00:01:12.039 --> 00:01:12.049 
fresher feel a little bit more confident

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:16.330 
fresher feel a little bit more confident
so<00:01:13.299> here<00:01:14.299> I<00:01:14.330> am<00:01:14.420> is<00:01:14.840> a<00:01:15.439> treatment<00:01:15.770> at<00:01:15.890> the<00:01:16.010> macro

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:16.340 
so here I am is a treatment at the macro

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:19.120 
so here I am is a treatment at the macro
microcurrent<00:01:17.270> so<00:01:17.780> the<00:01:17.960> muscle<00:01:18.229> is<00:01:18.350> held<00:01:18.950> out

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:19.130 
microcurrent so the muscle is held out

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:21.160 
microcurrent so the muscle is held out
tight<00:01:19.460> and<00:01:19.700> then<00:01:19.850> shaken<00:01:20.390> and<00:01:20.540> any<00:01:20.960> debris

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:21.170 
tight and then shaken and any debris

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:23.140 
tight and then shaken and any debris
that's<00:01:21.409> on<00:01:21.619> it<00:01:21.770> whether<00:01:22.130> it<00:01:22.250> be<00:01:22.280> fat<00:01:22.580> or<00:01:22.610> fluid

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:23.150 
that's on it whether it be fat or fluid

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:24.969 
that's on it whether it be fat or fluid
is<00:01:23.299> then<00:01:23.810> dispersed<00:01:24.200> through<00:01:24.439> the<00:01:24.530> lymphatic

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:24.979 
is then dispersed through the lymphatic

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:27.219 
is then dispersed through the lymphatic
system<00:01:25.009> the<00:01:25.630> treatment<00:01:26.630> is<00:01:26.750> based<00:01:26.900> on<00:01:27.140> the

00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:27.229 
system the treatment is based on the

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:28.840 
system the treatment is based on the
response<00:01:27.590> of<00:01:27.770> muscles<00:01:28.220> to<00:01:28.430> electric

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:31.100 
stimulation a method that has been used

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:33.489 
stimulation a method that has been used
for<00:01:31.249> years<00:01:31.520> to<00:01:31.700> shed<00:01:32.090> fat<00:01:32.390> and<00:01:32.659> prompt<00:01:33.140> muscle

00:01:33.489 --> 00:01:33.499 
for years to shed fat and prompt muscle

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:36.580 
for years to shed fat and prompt muscle
tone<00:01:33.770> so<00:01:34.340> where<00:01:34.609> does<00:01:34.759> the<00:01:34.939> fat<00:01:35.179> go<00:01:35.570> goes<00:01:36.439> out

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:37.899 
tone so where does the fat go goes out
through<00:01:36.710> the<00:01:36.770> lymphatic<00:01:37.070> system<00:01:37.219> and<00:01:37.729> then
