heavy<00:00:56.129> I<00:00:56.370> have<00:00:57.210> four<00:00:58.190> double<00:00:59.190> A<00:00:59.219> batteries<00:00:59.250> in

heavy I have four double A batteries in

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.689 
heavy I have four double A batteries in
there<00:01:00.140> so<00:01:01.140> it's<00:01:01.289> pretty<00:01:01.530> heavy<00:01:01.649> what's<00:01:02.489> on<00:01:02.609> the

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
there so it's pretty heavy what's on the

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:03.979 
there so it's pretty heavy what's on the
camera<00:01:03.000> it's<00:01:03.180> definitely<00:01:03.539> a<00:01:03.570> lot<00:01:03.629> heavier

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
camera it's definitely a lot heavier

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:05.000 
camera it's definitely a lot heavier
than<00:01:04.080> I<00:01:04.170> thought<00:01:04.199> it<00:01:04.439> was<00:01:04.500> going<00:01:04.619> to<00:01:04.680> be<00:01:04.830> and

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
than I thought it was going to be and

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.679 
than I thought it was going to be and
it's<00:01:05.640> definitely<00:01:05.820> getting<00:01:06.000> some<00:01:06.240> getting

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
it's definitely getting some getting

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:10.870 
it's definitely getting some getting
used<00:01:06.990> to<00:01:07.610> but<00:01:08.960> the<00:01:09.960> quality<00:01:10.140> is<00:01:10.320> pretty<00:01:10.500> good

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:10.880 
used to but the quality is pretty good

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:16.160 
used to but the quality is pretty good
it's<00:01:11.880> not<00:01:12.060> too<00:01:12.420> cheap<00:01:12.750> it<00:01:13.619> does<00:01:14.960> make<00:01:15.960> some

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
it's not too cheap it does make some

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:17.990 
it's not too cheap it does make some
loud<00:01:16.350> noises<00:01:16.380> when<00:01:17.040> you<00:01:17.130> fold<00:01:17.340> it<00:01:17.460> with<00:01:17.610> that<00:01:17.729> I

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
loud noises when you fold it with that I

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.730 
loud noises when you fold it with that I
don't<00:01:18.780> you<00:01:18.840> can<00:01:18.960> hear<00:01:19.080> that<00:01:21.110> anyways<00:01:22.110> I<00:01:22.290> can't

don't you can hear that anyways I can't

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.710 
don't you can hear that anyways I can't
really<00:01:22.890> compare<00:01:23.280> much<00:01:23.729> to<00:01:23.970> other<00:01:24.150> flashes<00:01:24.689> I

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
really compare much to other flashes I

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.660 
really compare much to other flashes I
haven't<00:01:25.140> really<00:01:25.409> dealt<00:01:26.280> with<00:01:26.400> any<00:01:26.549> other

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
s2 you can increase out the output level

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.719 
s2 you can increase out the output level
of<00:01:59.640> the<00:02:00.630> flash<00:02:00.869> and<00:02:01.140> things<00:02:01.259> of<00:02:01.380> that<00:02:01.579> but<00:02:02.579> this

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
of the flash and things of that but this

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:07.809 
of the flash and things of that but this
one<00:02:03.030> i<00:02:03.320> like<00:02:04.320> it<00:02:04.560> it<00:02:04.979> a<00:02:05.780> it's<00:02:06.780> pretty<00:02:07.049> nice

00:02:07.809 --> 00:02:07.819 
one i like it it a it's pretty nice

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:10.940 
one i like it it a it's pretty nice
pretty<00:02:08.819> simple<00:02:09.209> back<00:02:09.470> got<00:02:10.470> the<00:02:10.500> on<00:02:10.709> and<00:02:10.860> off

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
pretty simple back got the on and off

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.150 
pretty simple back got the on and off
switch<00:02:11.009> which<00:02:11.730> is<00:02:11.879> easy

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160 
switch which is easy

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.350 
switch which is easy
pretty<00:02:14.160> much<00:02:14.280> easy<00:02:14.430> just<00:02:14.670> turn<00:02:14.970> on<00:02:15.090> and<00:02:15.270> off

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
pretty much easy just turn on and off

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.990 
pretty much easy just turn on and off
and<00:02:15.660> then<00:02:16.560> this<00:02:16.860> is<00:02:16.920> the<00:02:17.040> different<00:02:17.520> output

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
and then this is the different output

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:27.820 
and then this is the different output
