00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.320
 very often the same as we have just seen now from the start menu 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.839
 and the ones that we have put here 

00:00:25.839 --> 00:00:29.300

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:47.769
 taskbar 

00:00:47.769 --> 00:00:50.769
 click with the right or secondary button 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:53.200
 it appears as always 

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:54.200
 options 

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:58.210

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:00.220
 quick start I have it 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:02.470
 activate this check box 

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:05.410
 indicates that I have it here down cyclically 

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:09.630
 look, I do not have it now, I have it deactivated if I go back again 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.410
 pulse with the right button 

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:12.730

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:14.700
 I'm going to toolbar 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.960
 notice that now that it is no longer active it is no longer visible 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:19.670
 if I apply again 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:21.600
 I make it visible 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.289
 this is a way 

00:01:23.289 --> 00:01:27.620

 we come with properties 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:38.200
 and this is where we will configure how I want the taskbar to act 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:40.080
 we will see in the next 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:42.790

 we have already seen then 

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:16.019
 how to set up to display ohno 

00:02:17.119 --> 00:02:18.769
 we have done the same 

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:20.129
 this area here 

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:21.619
 this area here 

00:02:21.619 --> 00:02:22.929
 is called 

00:02:22.929 --> 00:02:26.699
 start instead being here we will call you home 

00:02:29.899 --> 00:02:31.980
 suppose we want it to be microsoft 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:35.769
 a fat man in this part the tac and above because we use it a lot for 

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:38.769
 example I have the internet explorer browser 

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:41.850
 then we access the program that I want to put 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:44.079
 in the quick start menu 

00:02:44.079 --> 00:02:47.079
 we come often starts we access all the programs 

00:02:47.669 --> 00:02:49.889
 we access the box 

00:02:49.889 --> 00:02:51.199
 Guarch and turkey 

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:52.779

00:02:52.779 --> 00:02:53.999
 i see here 

00:02:53.999 --> 00:02:56.549
 an access to microsoft 

00:02:56.549 --> 00:03:00.029
 before we have done that we have pressed with the right button pose with dario 

00:03:00.029 --> 00:03:02.409
 to anchor what in the start menu 

00:03:02.409 --> 00:03:05.430
 Look, we've done that and we've done at least start 

00:03:06.559 --> 00:03:09.209
 the same thing you say to add 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:11.059
 at the beginning 

00:03:11.059 --> 00:03:15.109
 at the same time the war while of fast start to this bar that fixes 

00:03:15.109 --> 00:03:16.409
 by clicking here 

00:03:16.409 --> 00:03:17.619
 we are added 

00:03:17.619 --> 00:03:20.349
 a quick access from microsoft word 

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:21.639
 to the bar 

00:03:21.639 --> 00:03:24.039
 d start 

00:03:24.039 --> 00:03:25.679
 cyclic out 

00:03:25.679 --> 00:03:28.659
 whenever you want to access microsoft 

00:03:28.659 --> 00:03:30.269
 I will simply explain 

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:32.779
 in this quick access cone 

00:03:32.779 --> 00:03:34.389
 see yourself explained 

00:03:34.389 --> 00:03:37.469
 and now we see Microsoft 

00:03:37.469 --> 00:03:40.579
 how easy is it then to add icons 

00:03:40.579 --> 00:03:43.579
 to this bar here d quick access 

00:03:44.399 --> 00:03:47.399
 I close microsoft word 

00:03:49.969 --> 00:03:51.029
 how to remove 

00:03:51.029 --> 00:03:55.609
 an access from here let's suppose that I do not want this the access icon of 

00:03:55.609 --> 00:03:58.739
 microsoft word in the bar of 15 operative 

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:00.089
 Well, very simple 

00:04:00.089 --> 00:04:02.390
 you stand on top of him as if you were 

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:03.419
 to execute it 

00:04:03.419 --> 00:04:06.430
 but do not think it's with the left button but with the right button 

00:04:06.429 --> 00:04:08.489
 so that the options appear 

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:09.639
 look and here 

00:04:09.639 --> 00:04:10.769
 remove 

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:11.769
 Very simple 

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:12.719
 what is eliminated 

00:04:12.719 --> 00:04:15.049
 and he tells you he's sure 

00:04:15.049 --> 00:04:16.939
 remove move 

00:04:16.939 --> 00:04:18.009
 direct access 

00:04:18.009 --> 00:04:21.619
 top ten note that it's a shortcut and it's not really the program 

00:04:21.619 --> 00:04:22.289
 be that 

00:04:22.289 --> 00:04:23.509
 doing this 

00:04:23.509 --> 00:04:26.480
 you are not erasing anything of your by leaving it 

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:28.719
 do not worry 

00:04:28.719 --> 00:04:31.819
 dt yes yes you do want to remove it 

00:04:31.819 --> 00:04:33.020
 very good 

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:34.509
 We have already finished 

00:04:34.509 --> 00:04:35.740
 an icon 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:38.740
 of the toolbar that started 

00:04:40.639 --> 00:04:44.509
 we will be able to other tools and you will see that you can change the size 

00:04:44.509 --> 00:04:47.840
 let's put other things back again so much the start 

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:52.690
 look at microsoft word we have it here why do you remember that it is the 

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:55.020
 last program that we have opened 

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:58.020
 is getting on the list of programs you see how it's working 

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:01.499
 windows vista is putting us 

00:05:01.499 --> 00:05:06.279
 in an accessible way everything you use more enjoyable 

00:05:06.279 --> 00:05:10.180
 well instead of scrolling through the one with the right button here 

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:13.539
 and I will tell you the same thing add at least start 

00:05:13.539 --> 00:05:15.849
 I already have it added 

00:05:15.849 --> 00:05:19.649
 I'm going to add another one the photoshop for example is also used it very 

00:05:19.649 --> 00:05:20.230
 often 

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:22.339
 click here and that same thing 

00:05:22.339 --> 00:05:23.889
 add to the menu 

00:05:23.889 --> 00:05:25.309
 Of start 

00:05:25.309 --> 00:05:27.110
 we explain 

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:30.099
 as we are, is what I wanted to show you, look how we are adding 

00:05:30.099 --> 00:05:35.069
 several do not fit in this small space that has reserved the bar 

00:05:35.069 --> 00:05:35.870
 of tasks 

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:38.789
 keko on the desk or pressed the escape key 

00:05:38.789 --> 00:05:41.529
 to remove the start menu 

00:05:41.529 --> 00:05:44.529
 perfect look what happened there is more 

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:48.610
 a series of icons in the / quick start menu 

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:51.960
 and it does not fit then we thought this little double 

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:55.170
 double cyclic triangle here the icons appear 

00:05:55.879 --> 00:05:59.239
 hidden because they do not fit in this little bar here 

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:01.629
 who together options 

00:06:01.629 --> 00:06:05.110
 or to do is to separate this tool from here and select the program that 

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:06.539
 you want oct 

00:06:06.539 --> 00:06:08.310
 little kisses that are here 

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:11.249
 you can change the size of these bars 

00:06:11.249 --> 00:06:12.500
 so that they appear 

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:15.530
 more you knew less icons in your taskbar 

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:19.330
 in the start menu bar here 

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:20.529
 see what I can 

00:06:20.529 --> 00:06:23.579
 modify how many elements appear 

00:06:24.589 --> 00:06:27.020
 in this 

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:29.969
 in conclusion cybernaut 

00:06:29.969 --> 00:06:31.509
 in the menu bar 

00:06:31.509 --> 00:06:32.800
 Quick start 

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:36.509
 we will put those programs that we use more amen 

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:40.520
 you can quickly access anybody 

00:06:41.479 --> 00:06:45.529
 to put it simply taste access to it to any program 

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:50.169
 wells with the right button and you say add to the quick start 

00:06:50.169 --> 00:06:52.860
 and to remove it just as easily 

00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:56.560
 you put yourself in it you press with the right button pose with dario 

00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:57.629
 and tell him 

00:06:57.629 --> 00:06:59.800
 eliminated 

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:04.270
 we eliminate it not also a problem because it is a quick access 

00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:06.330
 windows vista facilitates us 

00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:07.190
 to work 

00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:08.330
 with the programs 

00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:09.270
 what do we use 

00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:12.009
 more often I tell him that I feel 

00:07:12.009 --> 00:07:14.729
 we'll see you very well in the next chapter
