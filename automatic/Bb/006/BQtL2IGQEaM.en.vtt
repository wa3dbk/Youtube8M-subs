00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:07.030
 this is the x4 exactly the name of the new 

00:00:03.909 --> 00:00:10.179
 express model juxtaposed so we have 

00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:13.360
 makes a transition from overlapping to 

00:00:10.179 --> 00:00:16.170
 juxtaposed with the barrel system 

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:19.420
 floating that you have and that allows 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:23.560
 more to have a tuning system 

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:26.830
 mechanics is also a benefit of 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:30.160
 can shoot bullets successively 

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:33.119
 while maintaining a good setting at 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:33.119
 level of convergence 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.899
 we are with david chappuis who we 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.460
 presents this year a novelty a 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:56.250
 real novelty for the second year 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:59.280
 successor last year everyone gets 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:01.710
 remembers the s12 so the express to to 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.750
 superimposed guns with a brand new 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:07.649
 convergence adjustment setting and 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:11.280
 this year you recide with this 

00:01:07.649 --> 00:01:14.549
 new s 14 eq it's exactly good 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:17.670
 this is the x4 exactly the name of the new 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:20.820
 express model juxtaposed so we have 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:24.000
 makes a transition from overlapping to 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:26.810
 juxtaposed with the barrel system 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:30.060
 floating that you have and that allows 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:34.200
 more to have a tuning system 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:37.470
 mechanics is also a benefit of 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:40.800
 can shoot bullets successively 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:42.030
 while maintaining a good setting at 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:44.399
 level of convergence 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.679
 so that's the big innovation 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:49.289
 that we transposed on the juxtaposed 

00:01:46.679 --> 00:01:51.750
 this year and so we called 

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:54.410
 actually x4 and which therefore consists of 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.940
 modify the bending of cannons for 

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:58.170
 change either ammunition or self 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:00.300
 when changing ammunition or 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.879
 of optics to always keep express who 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:04.379
 shoot right and just exactly and that 

00:02:02.879 --> 00:02:07.200
 it's actually the advantage 

00:02:04.379 --> 00:02:09.119
 extra that I did not specify who 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:12.270
 actually to be able to change very 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:15.360
 easily ammunition or remake a 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:18.150
 setting to mount an optics 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:20.490
 or a red dot finally here and then 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:22.410
 also we have reworked a 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:26.790
 little bit the drawing of the engraving we have it 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:29.880
 highlighting a connects my mustache that 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:32.730
 gives a more elegant effect to the 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:33.450
 rocking and with also a new 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:37.080
 connects even 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:39.630
 a new engraving pardon reworked 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:42.270
 and redesigned and so that's an express 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:47.950
 which is positioned very well on the 

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:50.560
 market and that is at 3850 euros so 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:52.450
 I think it's an express that goes 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:54.700
 have a real success the availability in 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:56.980
 caliber then the availability in 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:03:02.459
 caliber we have we propose three 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:04.209
 calibres on 8 57 on 9 3 74 and 30 06 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:06.610
 you can tell us on behalf of the 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:10.500
 Lacrosse lacrosse then we have a 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:14.890
 drawing of joux it is a German cheek 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:16.720
 with a quality of wood that varies from 2 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:19.540
 stars to the three stars otherwise we are 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:21.970
 in extractor version two stars if we 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:24.790
 is in three-star ejector version 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:27.040
 we also decline the version 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:29.079
 double trigger and the mono version 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:31.090
 relax the last word on the pwa 

00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:33.340
 maybe then the weight actually 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:37.120
 we have a weapon that is well balanced and 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:38.530
 which also between 3 kg and 3 kg 100 and which 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:40.540
 will be available in armory for 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:43.739
 this season quite available to 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:43.739
 from september
