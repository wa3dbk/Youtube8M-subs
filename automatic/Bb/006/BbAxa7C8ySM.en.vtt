out<00:01:33.920> of<00:01:34.160> the<00:01:34.220> roof

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:38.710 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:43.680 

now<00:01:39.710> with<00:01:39.920> regards<00:01:40.340> to<00:01:40.430> the<00:01:40.520> fan

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:43.690 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:49.560 

Harry<00:01:44.290> took<00:01:44.530> the<00:01:44.650> entire<00:01:44.770> thing<00:01:45.160> apart<00:01:48.570> we

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:49.570 
Harry took the entire thing apart we

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:56.280 
Harry took the entire thing apart we
tested<00:01:50.140> fuses<00:01:51.510> with<00:01:52.510> we<00:01:53.320> tested<00:01:53.830> switches

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:56.290 
tested fuses with we tested switches

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:00.300 
tested fuses with we tested switches
and<00:01:56.740> the<00:01:56.830> end<00:01:56.920> result<00:01:57.100> I<00:01:57.990> think<00:01:58.990> we<00:01:59.980> could<00:02:00.130> fix

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:00.310 
and the end result I think we could fix

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:04.040 
and the end result I think we could fix
it<00:02:00.520> if<00:02:01.480> we<00:02:01.630> had<00:02:01.810> a<00:02:01.840> melt<00:02:02.080> that<00:02:02.200> day<00:02:02.380> another<00:02:03.280> day

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:04.050 
it if we had a melt that day another day

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:06.660 
it if we had a melt that day another day
when<00:02:05.050> you're<00:02:05.140> working<00:02:05.440> on<00:02:05.530> your<00:02:05.710> RV<00:02:05.860> it<00:02:06.340> never

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:06.670 
when you're working on your RV it never

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:09.150 
when you're working on your RV it never
hurts<00:02:06.940> to<00:02:07.060> have<00:02:07.300> another<00:02:07.600> day<00:02:07.930> or<00:02:08.410> an<00:02:08.830> extra

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:09.160 
hurts to have another day or an extra

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:12.540 
hurts to have another day or an extra
set<00:02:09.369> of<00:02:09.399> hands<00:02:11.280> couldn't<00:02:12.280> have<00:02:12.370> said<00:02:12.520> it
