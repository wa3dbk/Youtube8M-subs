00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:22.079
 Heart sorrow Mr. Gysi 

00:00:22.079 --> 00:00:25.659
 and then we go back to the last speech in the opposition and 

00:00:25.659 --> 00:00:28.659
 so that percent even lets it buff 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.560
 So first I liked that the microphones were far down we were 

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:46.560
 were converted again 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:51.550
 Ladies and gentlemen, we are really on the cutting edge economically 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:53.210
 but no announcements 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:56.580
 only we as economic actors aim to get out of there 

00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:01.560
 this gas will drain Simons with tax revenues and tax revenues 

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:02.850
 State demand 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:03.700
 at all 

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:07.460
 We can be glad again that is a boost the initial broadcast 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:08.329
 we get 

00:01:08.329 --> 00:01:13.140
 only out again when we are on the whole motivation but if the conditions are so 

00:01:13.139 --> 00:01:16.600
 are that they total economy in the location Germany and Europe 

00:01:16.599 --> 00:01:20.250
 Overall, the perspective has been directed forward 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.380
 and this perspective is not forward 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:25.340
 if certain tax increases 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:27.080
 We increase the top tax rate 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:32.000
 Not only do all of them hit the money due to Dormann slumbering there 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.290
 they do not realize it I take something away 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.470
 I make sense and then it flourishes again Noack achievers 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:40.500
 the corporate world it's all true 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:41.510
 doing something like that 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:44.170
 and there must also be a total burden see it exists here 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:47.219
 a burden not only from a top tax rate 

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:51.999
 It always consists of the sum of total social contributions indirect 

00:01:51.999 --> 00:01:55.799
 Taxes direct taxes and thus the total burden Germany up there 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:58.710
 you have to look it is still the 4 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.020
 and show it 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.090
 not in crisis Rome 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.150
 the private also my classmates emanates 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:08.490
 to say we climb alone operate tax 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:11.879
 Surveys before battle that has itself 

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:14.439
 the Aban not respected 

00:02:14.439 --> 00:02:19.319
 but there was a nice example the Japanese Ryan Giggs opponents of high 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:20.540
 growth rates 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:22.069
 because of the crisis 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:26.129
 well before us the nineties the dead decade of the Japanese 

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:29.700
 what have they done exactly the suggestions the isolation 

00:02:30.679 --> 00:02:33.679
 but let me lean on it 

00:02:45.109 --> 00:02:48.439
 ladies and gentlemen the economy so the recognition of 

00:02:48.439 --> 00:02:50.989
 Famous couple will see you next year 

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:56.380
 "Variety com" let Maliki get the public debt percent 

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:58.220
 I save the state 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:01.900
 the cop for except that he invests the son of what makes reasonable 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:03.919
 There will also be a nice street 

00:03:03.919 --> 00:03:07.959
 what do you want us to give us ten children liked it everywhere 

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:12.209
 and the multiplier effect of the state he saves himself does not go out of the 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:16.859
 private actors overjoyed hire people we have earned new ones 

00:03:16.859 --> 00:03:20.919
 The income that German bakers buy doubles their business 

00:03:20.919 --> 00:03:25.769
 Stephan Oerter is complaining to god i need new car the auto industry 

00:03:27.029 --> 00:03:30.509
 they do not even know where to put a multiplier effect 

00:03:30.509 --> 00:03:34.279
 as experienced and who comes out in addition, both have won the balance and the 

00:03:34.279 --> 00:03:35.719
 were seeing 

00:03:35.719 --> 00:03:38.069
 while the LDP liberal 

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:39.260
 Burkhardt 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:43.509
 soothing when the multipliers Rome have soothing Zero 

00:03:43.509 --> 00:03:46.509
 between Oetker Mars 6 and 1 why 

00:03:47.039 --> 00:03:50.039
 simply because we at every state intervention 

00:03:50.639 --> 00:03:54.119
 Infections have damaged the other and we have stopped the traffic 

00:03:54.119 --> 00:03:55.740
 Multiplier does not go on 

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:56.849
 we were 

00:03:56.849 --> 00:03:58.259
 we hire which one 

00:03:58.259 --> 00:04:01.360
 we do what I say something nice now the program 

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:04.409
 we also have that in Autodesk's otherwise 

00:04:04.409 --> 00:04:05.819
 the pharmacologist have 

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:09.230
 hire more people right now an investor is smart too 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:12.860
 who does not think so short and says Bogota are have car sales 

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:16.550
 Powerplay People stop production is crazy what is here 

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:19.559
 going 

00:04:19.559 --> 00:04:23.199
 that would be nice May and the Indian times as scheduled on Tuesday at the huge 

00:04:23.199 --> 00:04:26.080
 Lower the central bank Oppermann Hall percent down 

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:30.379
 and then then such people invest a good gaddafi-faithfulness through the 

00:04:30.379 --> 00:04:32.639
 Euro area dar 

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:34.520
 that is not so it is as it thinks 

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:38.199
 it is sustainable for them that is sustainable they can afford it 

00:04:38.199 --> 00:04:40.069
 how far would they put the debt on 

00:04:40.069 --> 00:04:43.669
 with percent the half percentage point way too long it takes until the further on 

00:04:43.669 --> 00:04:45.410
 Capital market is given 

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:47.059
 really worth it otherwise 

00:04:47.059 --> 00:04:50.859
 WM is it all that is the perspective we put into liquid that 

00:04:50.859 --> 00:04:51.659
 called 

00:04:51.659 --> 00:04:55.689
 This is not the case and we need healthy structures to be healthy 

00:04:55.689 --> 00:04:56.779
 structures 

00:04:56.779 --> 00:04:59.479
 builds a medium term perspective 

00:04:59.479 --> 00:05:02.629
 and suggest that economics do not mean economy 

00:05:02.629 --> 00:05:06.449
 today I have a slightly more income cello today that there is no at least 

00:05:06.449 --> 00:05:09.599
 Five to ten years, the result is forward and thus one 

00:05:09.599 --> 00:05:11.650
 Calculus under plan I something 

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:12.850
 and then it has to work 

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:16.340
 And if the state makes scrapping premium then so has the carmaker 

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:20.200
 a bit over the water that is also quite good and beautiful Zwackau do not currently require 

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:23.340
 Kitchen and a seagull but the warrior-sponsored sink 

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:25.330
 So that's not so bad here 

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:28.659
 they always have that they always have repressive effect 

00:05:28.659 --> 00:05:33.029
 they go back and make distortions certain areas like com get high 

00:05:33.029 --> 00:05:35.989
 but mothers do not even know how we invest that means we can 

00:05:35.989 --> 00:05:38.580
 just with the state billions 

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:41.789
 to keep a little bit alive this is important in such a way 

00:05:41.789 --> 00:05:44.729
 Crisis for private demand with us also out of fear 

00:05:44.729 --> 00:05:48.860
 Demand in the country breaks way so Â«I do not believe that at all 

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:49.770
 we do something like that 

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:53.569
 but on the one hand, a business package 3 would 

00:05:53.569 --> 00:05:55.240
 not just the debt up 

00:05:55.240 --> 00:06:00.150
 Apelt Uhrmann but would get us out of the crisis Hertel is completely wrong 

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:00.930
 Approach" 

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:04.660
 after two stimulus packages must now be considered how do we get the 

00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:07.300
 Curve the structures overall healthy again 

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:10.300
 and you have to be brief on the crisis with this course 

00:06:11.199 --> 00:06:12.439
 who blame 

00:06:12.439 --> 00:06:15.039
 the market players we create 

00:06:15.039 --> 00:06:17.129
 now is the Armenian bank 

00:06:17.129 --> 00:06:18.740
 yes and thinker 

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:23.169
 more colorful this Frankfurt settled and there the afterwork party is 

00:06:23.169 --> 00:06:26.400
 and because their bonuses and bring the multipliers fat the 

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:28.930
 Inns among the people 

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:30.529
 and he says 

00:06:30.529 --> 00:06:32.600
 where these we do not want here with us 

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:34.629
 how do you go bonuses 

00:06:34.629 --> 00:06:37.629
 Hartmann return the Hoesch I also have a bit I think I buy 

00:06:37.629 --> 00:06:39.669
 I do not do that car's papers 

00:06:39.669 --> 00:06:41.379
 What happens if there is more 

00:06:41.379 --> 00:06:45.939
 he also suffered in hand in competitions again giving me at the Baltic neighbor 

00:06:45.939 --> 00:06:48.780
 People the employees a dome is supposed to wait in assumption 

00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:54.220
 they let the corks pop and their talk to the GdW a patio door and 

00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:57.660
 even the ethical principle of around 20 percent can not be otherwise 

00:06:57.660 --> 00:06:59.499
 now that's why 

00:06:59.499 --> 00:07:00.460
 consequently 

00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:04.780
 Profile Control Protector above does not bring anything anymore I believe I lost 

00:07:06.129 --> 00:07:10.509
 unregulated prophet control the inflate Borutta poems they 

00:07:10.509 --> 00:07:11.500
 completely right 

00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:14.460
 which ensures that the bubble burst and all roles
