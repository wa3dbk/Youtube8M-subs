00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.320 

I<00:00:00.680> built<00:00:01.680> my<00:00:01.770> first<00:00:01.949> AM<00:00:02.310> radio<00:00:02.460> with<00:00:02.970> my<00:00:03.120> dad

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:03.330 
I built my first AM radio with my dad

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:05.570 
I built my first AM radio with my dad
full-on<00:00:03.840> really<00:00:04.620> soldering<00:00:05.009> and<00:00:05.250> building

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:05.580 
full-on really soldering and building

effect<00:00:05.850> don't<00:00:06.000> you<00:00:06.210> know<00:00:06.330> so<00:00:06.629> rockets<00:00:07.140> and<00:00:07.440> we

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:08.130 
effect don't you know so rockets and we

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.120 
effect don't you know so rockets and we
launched<00:00:08.820> those<00:00:09.000> and<00:00:09.570> we<00:00:10.290> had<00:00:10.410> telescopes<00:00:10.650> and

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130 
launched those and we had telescopes and

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:12.680 
launched those and we had telescopes and
he<00:00:11.250> was<00:00:11.370> the<00:00:11.429> first<00:00:11.639> to<00:00:11.700> show<00:00:11.820> me<00:00:11.940> Mars<00:00:12.179> and<00:00:12.630> I

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
he was the first to show me Mars and I

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.140 
he was the first to show me Mars and I
slowly<00:00:13.049> got<00:00:13.200> into<00:00:13.710> the<00:00:14.190> space<00:00:14.670> program<00:00:14.849> that

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
slowly got into the space program that

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.990 
slowly got into the space program that
way<00:00:15.299> I<00:00:15.570> knew<00:00:16.049> in<00:00:16.560> high<00:00:16.770> school<00:00:17.130> that<00:00:17.340> I<00:00:17.670> wanted

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:07.510 
to try to figure out okay what could

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:09.310 
that be and that's what we're doing to

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:12.180 
that be and that's what we're doing to
find<00:01:09.520> out<00:01:10.200> the<00:01:11.200> top<00:01:11.380> of<00:01:11.470> types<00:01:11.650> of<00:01:11.770> cloud<00:01:11.979> that

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:12.190 
find out the top of types of cloud that

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:13.890 
find out the top of types of cloud that
we<00:01:12.370> see<00:01:12.580> with<00:01:12.610> sears<00:01:13.000> but<00:01:13.390> if<00:01:13.479> you<00:01:13.570> just<00:01:13.720> kind

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:13.900 
we see with sears but if you just kind

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:15.180 
we see with sears but if you just kind
of<00:01:13.960> look<00:01:14.140> at<00:01:14.290> titan<00:01:14.590> from<00:01:14.770> a<00:01:14.830> big<00:01:15.010> picture

when<00:01:43.200> Titan<00:01:43.590> doesn't<00:01:43.890> have<00:01:44.100> that<00:01:44.340> it<00:01:44.869> has

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
when Titan doesn't have that it has

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.709 
when Titan doesn't have that it has
nothing<00:01:46.200> instead<00:01:46.799> so<00:01:47.310> you<00:01:47.880> see<00:01:48.179> all<00:01:48.420> this

00:01:48.709 --> 00:01:48.719 
nothing instead so you see all this

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:50.990 
nothing instead so you see all this
methane<00:01:49.200> rains<00:01:49.530> the<00:01:50.100> nothing<00:01:50.460> drizzle

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
methane rains the nothing drizzle

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.270 
methane rains the nothing drizzle
methane<00:01:51.750> clouds<00:01:52.140> all<00:01:52.469> that<00:01:52.710> there's<00:01:53.009> a<00:01:53.039> lot<00:01:53.219> of

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
methane clouds all that there's a lot of

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.309 
methane clouds all that there's a lot of
early<00:01:53.640> earth<00:01:53.880> scientists<00:01:54.840> out<00:01:54.929> there<00:01:54.990> who

00:01:55.309 --> 00:01:55.319 
early earth scientists out there who

00:01:55.319 --> 00:01:57.349 
early earth scientists out there who
want<00:01:55.530> to<00:01:55.619> learn<00:01:55.770> about<00:01:55.979> you<00:01:56.670> know<00:01:56.789> life<00:01:57.119> is

00:01:57.349 --> 00:01:57.359 
want to learn about you know life is

00:01:57.359 --> 00:01:59.800 
want to learn about you know life is
their<00:01:57.509> life<00:01:57.719> and<00:01:57.929> we<00:01:58.079> can<00:01:58.109> go<00:01:58.439> to<00:01:58.500> Titan<00:01:58.829> as<00:01:59.130> one

00:01:59.800 --> 00:01:59.810 
their life and we can go to Titan as one

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:02.419 
their life and we can go to Titan as one
possibility<00:02:00.810> because<00:02:01.619> it<00:02:01.829> can<00:02:02.219> be

00:02:02.419 --> 00:02:02.429 
possibility because it can be

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:04.370 
possibility because it can be
representative<00:02:03.119> of<00:02:03.149> what<00:02:03.869> the<00:02:03.959> early<00:02:04.229> Earth

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
representative of what the early Earth

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.410 
representative of what the early Earth
was<00:02:04.409> like<00:02:04.799> before<00:02:04.920> before<00:02:05.670> we<00:02:05.909> were<00:02:06.030> here<00:02:06.209> it's

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
was like before before we were here it's

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.169 
was like before before we were here it's
a<00:02:06.450> completely<00:02:06.869> different<00:02:07.519> environment<00:02:08.519> than

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
a completely different environment than

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.360 
a completely different environment than
Earth<00:02:09.569> but<00:02:10.170> it<00:02:10.259> has<00:02:10.379> a<00:02:10.410> lot<00:02:10.619> of<00:02:10.649> similarities

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
Earth but it has a lot of similarities

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:12.979 
Earth but it has a lot of similarities
at<00:02:11.489> the<00:02:11.580> same<00:02:11.790> time<00:02:12.030> and<00:02:12.330> it's<00:02:12.450> a<00:02:12.569> very<00:02:12.599> dynamic

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 
at the same time and it's a very dynamic

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:15.949 
at the same time and it's a very dynamic
world<00:02:13.500> and<00:02:13.980> studying<00:02:14.459> it<00:02:14.700> you<00:02:15.540> can<00:02:15.690> do<00:02:15.780> any

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:15.959 
world and studying it you can do any

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:17.900 
world and studying it you can do any
type<00:02:16.140> of<00:02:16.340> photochemistry<00:02:17.340> different

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
type of photochemistry different

type of photochemistry different
chemistry<00:02:18.510> different<00:02:19.200> physics<00:02:19.709> I<00:02:19.950> was<00:02:20.730> always

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
chemistry different physics I was always

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.180 
chemistry different physics I was always
interested<00:02:21.599> in<00:02:22.140> math<00:02:22.290> and<00:02:22.319> science<00:02:22.500> but<00:02:23.099> my

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
interested in math and science but my

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:25.250 
interested in math and science but my
dad<00:02:23.370> I<00:02:23.400> think<00:02:23.700> was<00:02:23.819> a<00:02:23.849> key<00:02:24.090> role<00:02:24.299> I<00:02:24.540> enjoyed<00:02:25.110> it

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
dad I think was a key role I enjoyed it

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:26.360 
dad I think was a key role I enjoyed it
and<00:02:25.380> I<00:02:25.440> wanted<00:02:25.650> to<00:02:25.709> keep<00:02:25.860> doing<00:02:26.160> it<00:02:26.280> and

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
and I wanted to keep doing it and

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:30.049 
and I wanted to keep doing it and
learning<00:02:26.610> and<00:02:26.970> didn't<00:02:27.930> you
