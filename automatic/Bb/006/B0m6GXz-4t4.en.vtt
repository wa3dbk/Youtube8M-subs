00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
forgotten about so this is quite

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.640 
forgotten about so this is quite
controversial<00:01:03.420> subject<00:01:04.110> matter<00:01:04.320> in<00:01:04.530> the

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
controversial subject matter in the

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.919 
controversial subject matter in the

early eighties in America

00:01:07.929 --> 00:01:11.520 
early eighties in America

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:11.530 
but it was a decent-enough action

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:14.440

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:18.510 

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:20.570 

certainly<00:01:19.290> much<00:01:19.410> better<00:01:19.650> than<00:01:19.830> Rambo<00:01:20.220> free

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
certainly much better than Rambo free

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.410 
certainly much better than Rambo free

helicopter<00:02:23.640> waiting<00:02:24.090> above

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:26.260 
helicopter waiting above

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.199 
helicopter waiting above
if<00:02:26.860> you<00:02:26.980> get<00:02:27.129> you<00:02:27.220> explosive<00:02:27.550> arrows<00:02:28.000> you<00:02:28.180> can

00:02:28.199 --> 00:02:28.209 
if you get you explosive arrows you can

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:30.750 
if you get you explosive arrows you can
clear<00:02:28.569> away<00:02:28.810> for<00:02:29.050> the<00:02:29.140> jungle<00:02:29.610> might<00:02:30.610> make

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:30.760 
clear away for the jungle might make

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:35.170 
clear away for the jungle might make
make<00:02:31.000> things<00:02:31.239> a<00:02:31.299> little<00:02:31.360> bit<00:02:31.540> easier

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.180 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:37.539 

as<00:02:35.689> you<00:02:35.930> can<00:02:36.049> see<00:02:36.200> your<00:02:36.379> energy<00:02:36.680> bar<00:02:36.890> ticks

00:02:37.539 --> 00:02:37.549 
as you can see your energy bar ticks

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:39.750 
as you can see your energy bar ticks
down<00:02:37.730> quite<00:02:38.060> quickly<00:02:38.329> so<00:02:38.540> you<00:02:38.870> need<00:02:39.019> to<00:02:39.140> make<00:02:39.319> a

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 
down quite quickly so you need to make a

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:42.220 
down quite quickly so you need to make a
need<00:02:40.760> to<00:02:40.849> get<00:02:41.000> shift<00:02:41.239> on<00:02:41.450> but<00:02:41.840> we've<00:02:41.989> made<00:02:42.109> it

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:42.230 
need to get shift on but we've made it

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:44.620 
need to get shift on but we've made it
to<00:02:42.319> the<00:02:42.409> helicopter<00:02:42.950> there

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:44.630 
to the helicopter there

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:46.810 
to the helicopter there
that's<00:02:45.260> one<00:02:45.500> completed<00:02:45.890> and<00:02:46.190> now<00:02:46.250> rescued<00:02:46.700> of

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:46.820 
that's one completed and now rescued of

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:50.050 
that's one completed and now rescued of
POWs<00:02:47.390> from<00:02:47.480> the<00:02:47.630> camp<00:02:47.870> I<00:02:48.460> saw<00:02:49.460> I<00:02:49.670> think<00:02:49.790> we<00:02:49.970> just

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:50.060 
POWs from the camp I saw I think we just

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:51.550 
POWs from the camp I saw I think we just
need<00:02:50.180> to<00:02:50.360> like<00:02:50.720> like<00:02:50.900> a<00:02:50.930> movie<00:02:51.230> I<00:02:51.290> think<00:02:51.440> you

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:51.560 
need to like like a movie I think you

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:53.320 
need to like like a movie I think you
need<00:02:51.710> to<00:02:51.740> establish<00:02:52.250> that<00:02:52.280> there<00:02:52.490> are<00:02:52.670> POWs

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:53.330 
need to establish that there are POWs

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:56.290 
need to establish that there are POWs
that<00:02:53.420> it's<00:02:53.510> war<00:02:53.630> we<00:02:53.750> just<00:02:53.900> rescued<00:02:54.200> one<00:02:55.300> so

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:56.300 
that it's war we just rescued one so

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:58.570 
that it's war we just rescued one so
this<00:02:56.810> bits<00:02:57.050> quite<00:02:57.200> simple<00:02:57.590> just<00:02:57.860> keep<00:02:58.280> flying

00:02:58.570 --> 00:02:58.580 
this bits quite simple just keep flying

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:02.140 
this bits quite simple just keep flying
south<00:03:00.130> as<00:03:01.130> quickly<00:03:01.370> as<00:03:01.520> possible

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:02.150 
south as quickly as possible

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:04.090 
south as quickly as possible
so<00:03:02.330> you<00:03:02.420> reach<00:03:02.600> the<00:03:02.750> helicopter<00:03:03.500> pad<00:03:03.650> which<00:03:04.070> is

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:04.100 
so you reach the helicopter pad which is

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:05.960 
so you reach the helicopter pad which is
there

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
there

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:08.750 
there
and<00:03:06.510> then<00:03:06.780> which<00:03:07.020> need<00:03:07.200> to<00:03:07.230> get<00:03:07.440> the<00:03:07.560> POWs<00:03:08.490> out

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
and then which need to get the POWs out

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:10.700 
and then which need to get the POWs out
that<00:03:09.090> sort<00:03:09.300> of<00:03:09.330> gray<00:03:09.600> pillar<00:03:10.050> thing<00:03:10.350> there<00:03:10.560> oh

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:10.710 
that sort of gray pillar thing there oh

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:13.119 
that sort of gray pillar thing there oh
that's<00:03:10.920> a<00:03:11.010> Grenadier<00:03:11.310> picked<00:03:11.610> up<00:03:11.730> there

00:03:13.119 --> 00:03:13.129 
that's a Grenadier picked up there

00:03:13.129 --> 00:03:15.790 
that's a Grenadier picked up there
so<00:03:13.730> selects<00:03:14.030> a<00:03:14.150> knife

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:15.800 
so selects a knife

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:18.970 
so selects a knife
cut<00:03:16.400> the<00:03:16.490> door<00:03:16.670> open<00:03:17.090> and<00:03:17.690> there's<00:03:18.140> your<00:03:18.320> POWs

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:18.980 
cut the door open and there's your POWs

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:24.220 
cut the door open and there's your POWs
escape<00:03:19.340> you<00:03:19.520> are

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:24.230 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:27.040 

and<00:03:24.770> that's<00:03:25.459> pretty<00:03:25.700> much<00:03:25.819> it<00:03:26.120> apart<00:03:26.420> from<00:03:26.569> we

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:27.050 
and that's pretty much it apart from we

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:28.360 
and that's pretty much it apart from we
just<00:03:27.080> need<00:03:27.349> to<00:03:27.440> get<00:03:27.530> back<00:03:27.680> to<00:03:27.709> the<00:03:27.860> helicopter

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:28.370 
just need to get back to the helicopter

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:30.820 
just need to get back to the helicopter
and<00:03:28.459> escape<00:03:28.790> in<00:03:28.940> the<00:03:29.000> copter<00:03:29.500> so<00:03:30.500> I<00:03:30.530> pretty

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:30.830 
and escape in the copter so I pretty

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:34.600 
and escape in the copter so I pretty
easy<00:03:31.129> stuff<00:03:31.489> really<00:03:31.790> so<00:03:32.120> far<00:03:32.480> oh<00:03:33.430> and<00:03:34.430> then<00:03:34.519> you

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:34.610 
easy stuff really so far oh and then you

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:38.619 
easy stuff really so far oh and then you
blew<00:03:34.760> up<00:03:34.819> the<00:03:34.849> helicopter<00:03:36.370> so<00:03:37.370> right<00:03:38.300> this<00:03:38.510> is

00:03:38.619 --> 00:03:38.629 
blew up the helicopter so right this is

00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:41.089 
blew up the helicopter so right this is
the<00:03:38.690> final<00:03:39.080> bit<00:03:39.200> of<00:03:39.230> the<00:03:39.319> game

00:03:41.089 --> 00:03:41.099 
the final bit of the game

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:42.860 
the final bit of the game
which<00:03:41.640> is<00:03:41.790> the<00:03:41.879> hardest<00:03:42.299> part<00:03:42.569> of<00:03:42.629> the<00:03:42.689> game

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:42.870 
which is the hardest part of the game

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:44.959 
which is the hardest part of the game
actually<00:03:43.079> this<00:03:43.349> is<00:03:43.499> a<00:03:43.530> real<00:03:44.340> swine<00:03:44.640> to

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:44.969 
actually this is a real swine to

00:03:44.969 --> 00:03:47.720 
actually this is a real swine to
get<00:03:45.389> past<00:03:45.659> this<00:03:46.109> is<00:03:46.260> a<00:03:46.489> absolutely<00:03:47.489> mad

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:47.730 
get past this is a absolutely mad

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:51.619 
get past this is a absolutely mad
gunship<00:03:48.359> that<00:03:48.659> just<00:03:50.060> likes<00:03:51.060> to<00:03:51.150> fly<00:03:51.389> straight

00:03:51.619 --> 00:03:51.629 
gunship that just likes to fly straight

00:03:51.629 --> 00:03:53.619 
gunship that just likes to fly straight
into<00:03:52.049> you

00:03:53.619 --> 00:03:53.629 
into you

00:03:53.629 --> 00:03:55.989 
into you
not<00:03:54.230> very<00:03:54.319> realistic<00:03:54.709> so<00:03:55.430> I<00:03:55.459> just<00:03:55.640> headin<00:03:55.879> off

00:03:55.989 --> 00:03:55.999 
not very realistic so I just headin off

00:03:55.999 --> 00:03:58.929 
not very realistic so I just headin off
as<00:03:56.299> quickly<00:03:56.540> as<00:03:56.719> possible<00:03:56.749> and<00:03:57.530> the<00:03:58.489> trick

00:03:58.929 --> 00:03:58.939 
as quickly as possible and the trick

00:03:58.939 --> 00:04:02.080 
as quickly as possible and the trick
he<00:03:59.150> starts<00:03:59.450> appearing<00:03:59.629> here<00:04:00.909> trick<00:04:01.909> is<00:04:02.060> to

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:02.090 
he starts appearing here trick is to

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:08.530 
he starts appearing here trick is to
move<00:04:02.389> forward<00:04:02.719> a<00:04:02.780> bit<00:04:02.810> stop<00:04:03.560> wait<00:04:03.950> for<00:04:04.249> him

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:08.540 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:10.899 

what<00:04:09.079> if<00:04:09.170> you<00:04:09.260> do<00:04:09.409> avoid<00:04:09.799> him<00:04:10.040> crashing<00:04:10.579> into

00:04:10.899 --> 00:04:10.909 
what if you do avoid him crashing into

00:04:10.909 --> 00:04:13.509 
what if you do avoid him crashing into
you<00:04:11.030> because<00:04:11.299> of<00:04:11.629> tons<00:04:12.140> of<00:04:12.230> energy<00:04:12.379> and<00:04:12.739> the

00:04:13.509 --> 00:04:13.519 
you because of tons of energy and the

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:15.850 
you because of tons of energy and the
energy<00:04:13.970> for<00:04:14.209> some<00:04:14.360> strange<00:04:14.720> reason<00:04:14.870> is<00:04:15.349> always

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:15.860 
energy for some strange reason is always

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:18.759 
energy for some strange reason is always
constantly<00:04:16.370> a<00:04:16.459> trickling<00:04:16.970> down<00:04:17.470> so<00:04:18.470> you<00:04:18.530> do

00:04:18.759 --> 00:04:18.769 
constantly a trickling down so you do

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:22.080 
constantly a trickling down so you do
need<00:04:18.889> to<00:04:18.949> move<00:04:19.220> keep<00:04:19.579> moving<00:04:19.729> on<00:04:20.000> as<00:04:20.180> well<00:04:20.389> ah

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:22.090 
need to move keep moving on as well ah

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:26.529 
need to move keep moving on as well ah
see<00:04:23.090> I<00:04:23.120> mean<00:04:23.330> there<00:04:24.699> if<00:04:25.699> you<00:04:25.850> get<00:04:26.000> a<00:04:26.060> few<00:04:26.330> hits

00:04:26.529 --> 00:04:26.539 
see I mean there if you get a few hits

00:04:26.539 --> 00:04:28.719 
see I mean there if you get a few hits
on<00:04:26.750> him<00:04:27.220> right<00:04:28.220> there

00:04:28.719 --> 00:04:28.729 
on him right there

00:04:28.729 --> 00:04:31.270 
on him right there
he<00:04:28.970> doesn't<00:04:29.270> explode<00:04:29.660> but<00:04:30.229> I<00:04:30.530> think<00:04:30.949> if<00:04:31.070> you

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:31.280 
he doesn't explode but I think if you

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:34.629 
he doesn't explode but I think if you
shoot<00:04:31.699> him<00:04:31.729> a<00:04:31.880> few<00:04:32.150> times<00:04:32.479> he<00:04:33.160> stops<00:04:34.160> appearing

00:04:34.629 --> 00:04:34.639 
shoot him a few times he stops appearing

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:34.040 

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:36.520 

Commodore<00:05:34.700> 64<00:05:35.210> version<00:05:35.240> is<00:05:35.870> the<00:05:36.020> one<00:05:36.170> to<00:05:36.350> have

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:36.530 
Commodore 64 version is the one to have

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:39.940 
Commodore 64 version is the one to have
that's<00:05:37.100> a<00:05:37.840> pretty<00:05:38.840> decent<00:05:39.350> version<00:05:39.740> of<00:05:39.860> this

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:39.950 
that's a pretty decent version of this

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:44.440 
that's a pretty decent version of this
even<00:05:40.400> if<00:05:40.520> it<00:05:40.670> is<00:05:40.760> a<00:05:40.790> little<00:05:41.120> bit<00:05:41.270> crap<00:05:43.450> spectrum

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:44.450 
even if it is a little bit crap spectrum

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:46.690 
even if it is a little bit crap spectrum
version

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:46.700 
version

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:49.240 
version
as<00:05:47.270> kind<00:05:47.600> of<00:05:47.630> a<00:05:47.720> push<00:05:47.960> scrolling<00:05:48.830> system<00:05:49.160> on

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:49.250 
as kind of a push scrolling system on

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:51.730 
as kind of a push scrolling system on
the<00:05:49.370> go<00:05:49.520> actually<00:05:49.930> but<00:05:50.930> plays<00:05:51.140> a<00:05:51.170> lot<00:05:51.410> slower

00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:51.740 
the go actually but plays a lot slower

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:55.240 
the go actually but plays a lot slower
with<00:05:52.040> less<00:05:52.220> enemies<00:05:53.290> more<00:05:54.290> sedate<00:05:54.620> pace<00:05:54.650> but

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:55.250 
with less enemies more sedate pace but

00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:57.400 
with less enemies more sedate pace but
probably<00:05:56.210> a<00:05:56.270> little<00:05:56.390> bit<00:05:56.570> more<00:05:56.600> enjoyable<00:05:56.840> so

00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:57.410 
probably a little bit more enjoyable so

00:05:57.410 --> 00:05:59.410 
probably a little bit more enjoyable so
it's<00:05:58.250> probably<00:05:58.550> probably<00:05:58.790> got<00:05:59.030> the<00:05:59.090> weakest

00:05:59.410 --> 00:05:59.420 
it's probably probably got the weakest

00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:02.320 
it's probably probably got the weakest
version<00:05:59.900> of<00:06:00.560> the<00:06:00.710> loss<00:06:00.890> so<00:06:01.580> yes<00:06:02.000> it's<00:06:02.210> pretty

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:02.330 
version of the loss so yes it's pretty

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:05.590 
version of the loss so yes it's pretty
terrible<00:06:02.840> stuff<00:06:03.850> four<00:06:04.850> and<00:06:04.970> a<00:06:05.000> half<00:06:05.030> out<00:06:05.570> of

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:05.600 
terrible stuff four and a half out of

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:06.830 
terrible stuff four and a half out of
