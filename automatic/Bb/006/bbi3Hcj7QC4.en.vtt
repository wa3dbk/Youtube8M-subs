00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:37.910 
happening today I'm due city but what I
still<00:02:36.269> get<00:02:36.599> is<00:02:36.750> why<00:02:36.930> Jonathan<00:02:37.440> showed<00:02:37.650> up<00:02:37.799> at

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
still get is why Jonathan showed up at

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.600 
still get is why Jonathan showed up at
the<00:02:38.069> house<00:02:38.220> while<00:02:38.489> I<00:02:38.549> was<00:02:38.670> over<00:02:39.030> there<00:02:39.209> I<00:02:40.610> can

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
the house while I was over there I can

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:45.319 
the house while I was over there I can
safely<00:02:41.849> say<00:02:42.060> with<00:02:43.049> 100%<00:02:43.799> accuracy<00:02:44.549> that<00:02:45.120> that

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:45.329 
safely say with 100% accuracy that that

00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:47.300 
safely say with 100% accuracy that that
was<00:02:45.450> the<00:02:45.540> first<00:02:45.810> time<00:02:46.049> job<00:02:46.349> that<00:02:46.379> ever<00:02:46.829> checked

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
was the first time job that ever checked

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:50.960 
was the first time job that ever checked
on<00:02:47.579> his<00:02:47.819> little<00:02:48.150> brother<00:02:48.390> I<00:02:49.549> guess<00:02:50.549> it<00:02:50.849> was

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
on his little brother I guess it was

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:52.819 
on his little brother I guess it was
just<00:02:51.000> coincidental<00:02:51.900> that<00:02:52.140> it'd<00:02:52.379> happen<00:02:52.620> to<00:02:52.709> be

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:52.829 
just coincidental that it'd happen to be

00:02:52.829 --> 00:02:54.550 
just coincidental that it'd happen to be
a<00:02:52.860> house<00:02:53.099> full<00:02:53.340> of<00:02:53.400> girls

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:54.560 
a house full of girls

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:59.660 
a house full of girls
