00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:17.080 
modern warfare stuff and laid it on the

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:20.760 
modern warfare stuff and laid it on the
pc<00:02:17.320> I'm<00:02:17.620> not<00:02:17.830> too<00:02:18.690> keen<00:02:19.690> about<00:02:19.750> flying<00:02:20.440> stuff

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:20.770 
pc I'm not too keen about flying stuff

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:22.620 
pc I'm not too keen about flying stuff
on<00:02:20.920> the<00:02:21.010> PC<00:02:21.400> because<00:02:21.610> I'm<00:02:21.910> just<00:02:22.090> not<00:02:22.180> so<00:02:22.390> good

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:22.630 
on the PC because I'm just not so good

on the PC because I'm just not so good
at<00:02:22.810> it<00:02:22.840> and<00:02:23.340> I<00:02:24.340> just<00:02:24.550> think<00:02:24.730> it<00:02:24.790> would<00:02:24.850> play

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.640 
at it and I just think it would play
better<00:02:25.210> on<00:02:25.300> the<00:02:25.510> console<00:02:25.900> so<00:02:26.110> hopefully<00:02:26.530> i'll

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.230 
console which I think it will in mice my

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:48.570 
console which I think it will in mice my
situation<00:02:47.800> just<00:02:47.920> because<00:02:48.070> I<00:02:48.130> tend<00:02:48.340> to<00:02:48.400> play

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:48.580 
situation just because I tend to play

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:50.490 
situation just because I tend to play
better<00:02:48.790> on<00:02:48.850> the<00:02:49.030> console<00:02:49.390> and<00:02:49.570> I'm<00:02:50.140> they've

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.500 
better on the console and I'm they've

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:52.050 
better on the console and I'm they've
taken<00:02:50.740> a<00:02:50.920> little<00:02:51.040> while<00:02:51.220> to<00:02:51.550> release<00:02:51.850> it<00:02:52.000> on

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:52.060 
taken a little while to release it on

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:53.940 
taken a little while to release it on
the<00:02:52.209> 360<00:02:52.720> years<00:02:52.930> so<00:02:53.140> hopefully<00:02:53.440> they've<00:02:53.800> been

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:53.950 
the 360 years so hopefully they've been

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:56.310 
the 360 years so hopefully they've been
tightening<00:02:54.220> up<00:02:54.570> some<00:02:55.570> of<00:02:55.690> the<00:02:55.750> problems<00:02:55.990> that
