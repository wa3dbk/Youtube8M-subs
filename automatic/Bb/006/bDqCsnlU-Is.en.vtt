less<00:05:11.730> outdated<00:05:12.300> than<00:05:12.420> what<00:05:12.540> they<00:05:12.660> have<00:05:12.870> in<00:05:13.050> the

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:13.170 
less outdated than what they have in the

would have killed the PlayStation 4

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:20.080 
would have killed the PlayStation 4
because<00:05:19.230> it<00:05:19.290> would<00:05:19.380> have<00:05:19.470> been<00:05:19.560> too<00:05:19.680> expensive

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:20.090
