00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:35.879
 Well now it's good to learn a new technique 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.890
 and then people first to you 

00:00:35.879 --> 00:00:40.170

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:43.170
 essential that you were aware the ace 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.610
 beck why not slip when you 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.680
 have teaching with your brother will be the same 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.050
 thing will only change that you will enter 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:52.290
 front of the Spanish but the device 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:55.170
 on the pipe to hit more easily 

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:56.550
 you see at the beginning not so parallel with the 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.469
 hand or the side you see in between 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.020
 Entering side which will facilitate 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:03.030
 you fit in or lose the fear of 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.949
 but it is the same as if 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.090
 it was 12 big because you know it's 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:09.899
 same 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:12.509
 It 's just a matter of you on the same floor. 

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:15.360
 with bigger on top of brother took 

00:01:12.509 --> 00:01:18.390
 a powerconnect passed this 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:21.300
 help a lot do not want to send 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:24.780
 risk a lot of people think at the beginning you already 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:27.330
 have to turn the skateboard into the air in the box 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.640
 12 big mann on top of the brother you 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.560
 get it if you did not have it if you did not 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.020
 get the verdict off the banister 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.599
 of an animal in the big ones you continue to 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.310
 train in the great that's only you have in 

00:01:36.599 --> 00:01:39.569
 base even if from there you saw how you 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.160
 will see that it is very easy 

00:01:39.569 --> 00:01:44.090
 the position of the pec put mandaÃº 

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:47.130
 frontside the reflex is that way here 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:49.200
 inside that way on the railing like me 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.979
 I told you, it 's good for you to come in half 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.990
 beside 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:54.509
 will facilitate the fitting then the position 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.340
 with position is the same position of an eye 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:59.250
 of a kraft maneuvers that you have to 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.899
 even if you put your feet the same 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.690
 way you feel more comfortable 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:04.770
 from putting more back but on top 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:06.360
 screw 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:09.090
 I send playmaker putting his foot this 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:11.150
 Then it's easier for me, then. 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:13.560
 I see entered the railing that way 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:16.650
 apply the eye to not give big knots 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:18.060
 the top of the banister and hear what 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:21.020
 enter an overclock you will use 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:23.370
 it will only exit after you have 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:25.260
 overclocking 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:26.610
 even if you only fit and I got 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.500
 afraid to leave brother 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:31.160
 The important thing is that you fit first 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:33.530
 after you've managed to fit 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:36.290
 only train the body so you can slide the 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:38.030
 body will look like a credit 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:39.410
 only the only difference is that the body 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:41.510
 will stay home with his brother 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:43.220
 It does not help you live send an 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:45.650
 hovercraft and leave the body ahead 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:47.600
 think it's a believer you're going to fall 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:50.540
 Forward when you saw skateboard is going to be with 

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:52.790
 the pet brother hit at the beginning I 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:55.670
 had difficulty enough to whom today 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:57.740
 although I have a lot in the base but it is 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:58.820
 important only you saw when it was time to send 

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:00.590
 the freight 

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:02.840
 Do you see that the body goes home with his brother? 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:05.000
 feet and stay in that speech like that or 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:05.600
 less than your body you leave the 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.700
 message 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:10.040
 this will make you happy already entered 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:12.440
 even slip to the end 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:15.160
 then it is after you have 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:18.200
 sliding networks was named that way 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:20.870
 totally with only 12 and all the weight 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:24.050
 12 even and back relieved 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:26.600
 You'll come to get out, it's a bit more. 

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:28.370
 complicated than the great big river that 

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:30.650
 How much will you be here that was not going to leave? 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:32.360
 You do this here, you do not want to take it. 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:35.480
 Your body will go to the other side of the 

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:37.550
 brother but it's almost the same thing you're lonely 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:39.380
 will have to give a new one a little more 

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:41.360
 A little stronger A little stronger 

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:43.459
 You go and wine and you will not leave this 

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:47.270
 so that it will not hit the shaft 

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:49.610
 such you walk around and type name and it leaves for the 

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:52.340
 on the other hand, or what is on the 

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:53.630
 so that the gift does not value here and is 

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:55.400
 drags forward 

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:56.510
 so you will hit the maneuver more 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:58.580
 easy 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:01.130
 so this is the tip I give you 

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:03.410
 let the propagated with the brother use 

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:06.050
 until the end in the hour of strength there play 

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:08.510
 Other side when you will send 

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:10.610
 rockslide you're going to leave you pull shoulders 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:12.350
 and does the same thing but does not forget 

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:15.770
 to pull an aquino in the front foot 

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:17.180
 if it's done that way it will get out 

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:19.730
 be more beautiful you will leave more 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:21.620
 easy then common mistakes are that me 

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:24.740
 I just spoke you do not pull on time. 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:26.570
 skateboarding ended up splashing or not. 

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:29.090
 you start having enough difficulty in 

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:30.590
 fit but it's only you to follow the tips 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:32.870
 What am I talking about in dogs? 

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:34.760
 big pull up is much easier 

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:36.710
 You'll get it right it 'll look more beautiful. 

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:39.340
 so that's it , I'll send it now 

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:39.340
