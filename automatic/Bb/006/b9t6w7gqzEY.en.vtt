product is a scissors and a leggy plant

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.240 
product is a scissors and a leggy plant
which<00:00:21.900> is<00:00:21.930> what<00:00:22.230> happens<00:00:22.619> to<00:00:22.769> your<00:00:22.890> plants

unfortunately the plant keeps reaching
for<00:00:27.689> the<00:00:27.840> sky<00:00:28.050> and<00:00:28.410> then<00:00:28.949> you<00:00:29.310> have<00:00:29.580> a<00:00:29.609> problem

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.490 
for the sky and then you have a problem
because<00:00:30.090> it's<00:00:30.359> too<00:00:30.570> big<00:00:30.960> and<00:00:31.170> it<00:00:31.230> doesn't

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
because it's too big and it doesn't

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.620 
because it's too big and it doesn't
really<00:00:31.619> hold<00:00:31.800> itself<00:00:32.130> up<00:00:32.340> so<00:00:33.120> to<00:00:33.210> fix<00:00:33.510> this

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
problem um get a scissors and this is

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:37.940 
problem um get a scissors and this is
actually<00:00:36.989> good<00:00:37.110> for<00:00:37.140> the<00:00:37.320> plant<00:00:37.559> so<00:00:37.680> you<00:00:37.710> don't

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
actually good for the plant so you don't

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.400 
actually good for the plant so you don't
have<00:00:38.040> to<00:00:38.160> be<00:00:38.280> afraid<00:00:38.870> what<00:00:39.870> you<00:00:39.960> want<00:00:40.140> to<00:00:40.230> do

have to be afraid what you want to do

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.139 
have to be afraid what you want to do
for<00:00:40.800> plants<00:00:41.190> like<00:00:41.309> this<00:00:41.460> and<00:00:41.640> this<00:00:41.700> is<00:00:41.760> a<00:00:41.910> basil

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
for plants like this and this is a basil

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:45.350 
for plants like this and this is a basil
plant<00:00:42.660> is<00:00:42.870> you<00:00:43.079> want<00:00:43.290> to<00:00:43.379> find<00:00:44.340> a<00:00:44.520> spot<00:00:44.850> on<00:00:45.059> the

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
plant is you want to find a spot on the

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.380 
plant is you want to find a spot on the
plant<00:00:45.600> where<00:00:45.930> the<00:00:46.770> it's<00:00:47.070> between<00:00:47.280> two<00:00:47.910> sets<00:00:48.210> of

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
plant where the it's between two sets of

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.000 
plant where the it's between two sets of
true<00:00:48.629> leaves<00:00:48.899> and<00:00:49.289> that's<00:00:49.710> where<00:00:49.920> you're

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
true leaves and that's where you're

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.860 
true leaves and that's where you're
actually<00:00:50.160> going<00:00:50.340> to<00:00:50.520> snip<00:00:51.149> the<00:00:51.180> plant<00:00:51.629> and

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
actually going to snip the plant and

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.590 
actually going to snip the plant and
then<00:00:52.440> by<00:00:52.590> doing<00:00:52.620> that<00:00:53.160> it's<00:00:53.850> actually<00:00:54.420> going

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
then by doing that it's actually going

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.020 
then by doing that it's actually going
to<00:00:54.750> promote<00:00:55.230> more<00:00:55.829> energy<00:00:56.280> going<00:00:56.520> into<00:00:56.820> the

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
to promote more energy going into the

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.729 
to promote more energy going into the
plant<00:00:57.270> and<00:00:57.360> promote<00:00:57.780> more<00:00:57.930> growth<00:00:58.320> coming

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
plant and promote more growth coming

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.529 
plant and promote more growth coming
from<00:00:58.890> the<00:00:59.010> other<00:00:59.160> part<00:00:59.640> that's<00:00:59.820> remaining<00:01:00.210> and

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
from the other part that's remaining and

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.869 
from the other part that's remaining and
by<00:01:01.109> doing<00:01:01.320> this<00:01:01.620> your<00:01:01.920> plant<00:01:02.219> will<00:01:02.340> actually

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
by doing this your plant will actually

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.090 
by doing this your plant will actually
stop<00:01:03.660> being<00:01:03.930> so<00:01:04.140> leggy<00:01:04.350> and<00:01:04.650> then<00:01:04.830> start

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
stop being so leggy and then start

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.620 
stop being so leggy and then start
branching<00:01:05.369> out<00:01:05.640> and<00:01:05.700> be<00:01:05.970> a<00:01:06.000> lot<00:01:06.240> more<00:01:06.390> bushy

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
branching out and be a lot more bushy

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.140 
branching out and be a lot more bushy
and<00:01:07.170> then<00:01:07.350> you'll<00:01:07.470> have<00:01:07.590> more<00:01:07.799> basil<00:01:08.189> so

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
and then you'll have more basil so

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.570 
and then you'll have more basil so
plants<00:01:09.570> generally<00:01:09.960> like<00:01:10.170> to<00:01:10.200> be<00:01:10.920> pruned<00:01:11.340> if

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
plants generally like to be pruned if

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.580 
plants generally like to be pruned if
they<00:01:11.760> have<00:01:12.000> been<00:01:12.299> let<00:01:12.540> go<00:01:12.570> and<00:01:12.990> they<00:01:13.409> don't

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
they have been let go and they don't

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.120 
they have been let go and they don't
have<00:01:13.770> enough<00:01:13.979> Sun<00:01:14.220> B<00:01:14.520> so<00:01:15.710> this<00:01:16.710> is<00:01:16.770> a<00:01:16.890> good

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
have enough Sun B so this is a good

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:18.620 
have enough Sun B so this is a good
thing<00:01:17.340> to<00:01:17.430> do<00:01:17.520> so<00:01:17.700> don't<00:01:17.880> feel<00:01:18.000> afraid<00:01:18.360> it

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
thing to do so don't feel afraid it

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.410 
thing to do so don't feel afraid it
doesn't<00:01:18.840> hurt<00:01:19.020> the<00:01:19.170> plant<00:01:19.380> not<00:01:19.830> very<00:01:20.009> much<00:01:20.420> so

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
doesn't hurt the plant not very much so

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:22.940 
doesn't hurt the plant not very much so
to<00:01:21.479> do<00:01:21.960> this<00:01:22.110> you<00:01:22.320> just<00:01:22.470> take<00:01:22.650> your<00:01:22.830> scissors

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
to do this you just take your scissors

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.179 
to do this you just take your scissors
and<00:01:23.450> you<00:01:24.450> find<00:01:24.810> a<00:01:24.900> good<00:01:25.049> spot<00:01:25.229> on<00:01:25.560> the<00:01:25.770> plant<00:01:26.009> to

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
and you find a good spot on the plant to

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.670 
and you find a good spot on the plant to
cut<00:01:26.400> and<00:01:26.850> if<00:01:27.509> there's<00:01:27.689> flower<00:01:27.990> buds<00:01:28.320> forming

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
cut and if there's flower buds forming

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.109 
cut and if there's flower buds forming
you<00:01:28.770> want<00:01:28.920> to<00:01:28.979> go<00:01:29.070> beneath<00:01:29.369> the<00:01:29.430> flower<00:01:29.790> buds

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
you want to go beneath the flower buds

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.300 
you want to go beneath the flower buds
and<00:01:30.479> then<00:01:31.049> you<00:01:31.140> would<00:01:31.259> just<00:01:31.290> snip<00:01:31.650> right<00:01:31.950> here

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
and then you would just snip right here

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.060 
and then you would just snip right here
and<00:01:32.640> then<00:01:33.180> you<00:01:33.299> can<00:01:33.450> see<00:01:33.689> how<00:01:33.930> once<00:01:34.770> you<00:01:34.920> do

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
and then you can see how once you do

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:36.410 
and then you can see how once you do
that<00:01:35.220> in<00:01:35.400> a<00:01:35.460> couple<00:01:35.729> weeks<00:01:35.850> you'll<00:01:36.119> start<00:01:36.329> to

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
that in a couple weeks you'll start to

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.050 
that in a couple weeks you'll start to
see<00:01:36.570> new<00:01:36.750> growth<00:01:37.020> coming<00:01:37.439> and<00:01:37.670> then<00:01:38.670> the<00:01:38.700> plant

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
see new growth coming and then the plant

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.609
