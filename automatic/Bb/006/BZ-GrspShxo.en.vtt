00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.240
 Hello everyone and today we have enough 

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:08.880
 unusual series 

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:13.170
 there will be and we can say mini-games 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:18.330
 or games in the game as it is more convenient for someone 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:21.449
 joint games for enrages what 's the first 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:23.939
 the game is a ring swiss we have such here 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:26.010
 two robots and they each have separate 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:30.380
 control they can turn there 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:35.010
 and bludgeon each other respectively 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:39.870
 the game takes place on the keyboard that is on 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:42.899
 gadgets keys g and h jeu and stuff then 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:46.170
 have a mindset im turning body and swing 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:50.430
 fists respectively mirror we 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:52.530
 can control our second robot and 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:55.910
 so do fight one of course not very 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:01:01.410
 convenient to do it but two can be arranged 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:05.369
 some kind of fight and understand which of you 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:07.619
 stronger management is relatively easy 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:09.840
 in fact, that is, it is duplicated 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:12.780
 for one and for the second robot that is 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:16.710
 for the first one we have left right 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:19.610
 body turn and 14 on on the block with us 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:22.220
 pushes pistons into the idea of ​​fists 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:25.049
 two threesome fiver six 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:27.299
 controls the left and right hand 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:30.840
 respectively the same for the second 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:34.890
 the robot here the button o &amp; l is our fists 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:37.110
 u and a and this is our right shoulder 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:40.770
 if so watch jack and this is our left 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.720
 shoulder turns at us on g and h that is 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.810
 principle 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:48.479
 a couple of times you can try to understand how 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:51.590
 twist fists how to push them 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.590
 and how to give 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:57.549
 how to strike your opponent what 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:59.799
 so here is a funny toy 

00:01:57.549 --> 00:02:03.670
 references of course in the description well 

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:07.240
 then we are the real pinball in 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:09.450
 which we played on windows windows xp 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:12.370
 and so on playback speed 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:14.709
 preferably even 40 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:17.379
 percent principle on gameplay and so 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:21.690
 say it does not affect let's 

00:02:17.379 --> 00:02:21.690
 try to run our design 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:29.019
 a little bit by the way podlagivaet very 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:31.780
 strange but even by 19 percent themselves 

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:35.620
 records in fact she shouldn't be so 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:39.610
 strongly lag possible knife game 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:41.739
 sloppy loaded naturally 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:45.250
 management here is pretty easy too 

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:47.920
 we raise the element above if we 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:50.739
 we want to initially ours and the core 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:52.360
 which fly out of the cannon left by 

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:55.660
 another trajectory then my 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:59.980
 we shoot so now is not very good 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:02.280
 was she flew through the texture so 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:05.109
 of course not be 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:08.109
 let's try again now he 

00:03:05.109 --> 00:03:10.510
 we went fine that is in 

00:03:08.109 --> 00:03:13.030
 principle as in the usual pin more 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:15.639
 the main elements are these 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:18.010
 t-shirts and with the help of them we can 

00:03:15.639 --> 00:03:20.530
 repel our core and run it by 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:22.500
 new let's see how it looks 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:24.340
 that is, we could him him somewhere 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:27.819
 run 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:29.470
 he flew naturally he can 

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:31.620
 move unfortunately action 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:35.019
 points are not provided here 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:39.609
 there are different pistons here that is 

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:43.510
 when he flies into a closed area where 

00:03:39.609 --> 00:03:46.359
 can not get anything and there is still 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:49.720
 some kind of elements that can 

00:03:46.359 --> 00:03:52.989
 push there is such a fun game 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:55.329
 I did not even lag by 40 percent 

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:58.810
 I don’t know why she’s cheating now 

00:03:55.329 --> 00:04:01.509
 check in yourself but overall it is very 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:02.530
 cool really want you I want you 

00:04:01.509 --> 00:04:05.140
 to tell 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:08.200
 what is the last game is hit the ball 

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:14.080
 the simplest possible at 100 percent 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:16.660
 and and play this two cars that is one 

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:19.750
 controlled by arrows and shift 

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:23.320
 control she pushes or defends her 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:29.169
 the ball that is the goal of the game to knock the ball 

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:33.520
 the enemy is known the enemy too 

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:42.640
 the ball also has its control so 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:43.120
 she's ruled by g &amp; g and jim cut roughly 

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:49.000
 by saying 

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:54.300
 and y already that is forward back right and left 

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:56.979
 she f we push our alcohol will give up and 

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:59.500
 a shot that is in this way we can 

00:04:56.979 --> 00:05:02.380
 win that is for two this is the most 

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:04.510
 great toy perhaps that is 

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:08.950
 very simple no one will lag 

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:12.150
 and you can have fun with someone 

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:16.330
 this is unfortunately all interesting 

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:18.550
 mini-games you can say so if you have 

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:21.700
 there were some ideas for this 

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:24.340
 bill i'm waiting for all your suggestions and i 

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:26.740
 I will definitely review them all 

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:29.400
 thanks to the design in the description to the new 

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:29.400
 meeting
