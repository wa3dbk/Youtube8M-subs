know<00:02:18.090> Islam<00:02:18.690> I<00:02:18.930> could<00:02:19.080> beat<00:02:19.200> this<00:02:19.350> guy<00:02:19.560> who's<00:02:19.770> a

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
know Islam I could beat this guy who's a

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:22.490 
know Islam I could beat this guy who's a
real<00:02:20.040> champ<00:02:20.340> okay<00:02:20.730> at<00:02:21.450> the<00:02:21.780> end<00:02:21.840> of<00:02:22.020> the<00:02:22.080> day<00:02:22.230> I

real champ okay at the end of the day I

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:26.300 
real champ okay at the end of the day I
think<00:02:22.890> it's<00:02:23.280> about<00:02:24.200> realistically<00:02:25.310> just

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
think it's about realistically just

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:29.960 
think it's about realistically just
bringing<00:02:26.880> attention<00:02:27.770> to<00:02:28.770> yourself<00:02:29.280> by

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
bringing attention to yourself by

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:32.270 
bringing attention to yourself by
mentioning<00:02:30.570> for<00:02:30.990> his<00:02:31.140> name<00:02:31.350> that's<00:02:31.980> it

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
mentioning for his name that's it

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.930 
mentioning for his name that's it
because<00:02:32.970> you<00:02:33.300> won't<00:02:33.420> have<00:02:33.540> no<00:02:33.870> shot<00:02:34.470> of

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:34.940 
because you won't have no shot of

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:39.949 
because you won't have no shot of
beating<00:02:35.940> Floyd<00:02:37.340> even<00:02:38.340> fucking<00:02:39.300> one<00:02:39.510> inkling

00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:39.959 
beating Floyd even fucking one inkling

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:42.530

of<00:02:40.290> beating<00:02:41.070> Floyd<00:02:41.280> well<00:02:42.000> that's<00:02:42.209> why<00:02:42.360> can

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
of beating Floyd well that's why can

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:44.330 
of beating Floyd well that's why can
beat<00:02:42.720> him<00:02:42.870> one<00:02:43.200> hand<00:02:43.440> and<00:02:43.709> that's<00:02:44.100> a<00:02:44.190> good

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
beat him one hand and that's a good

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:45.980 
beat him one hand and that's a good
point<00:02:44.550> I<00:02:44.700> mean<00:02:44.730> that<00:02:45.090> probably<00:02:45.660> the<00:02:45.810> two
