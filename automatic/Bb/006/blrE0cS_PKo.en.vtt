One<00:00:08.639> car<00:00:08.790> and<00:00:09.240> the<00:00:09.420> position<00:00:09.900> it's<00:00:10.080> really<00:00:10.410> as

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
One car and the position it's really as

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:12.530 
One car and the position it's really as
if<00:00:10.769> you<00:00:10.889> were<00:00:11.010> lying<00:00:11.280> down<00:00:11.550> in<00:00:11.820> the<00:00:11.910> racing<00:00:12.179> car

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
if you were lying down in the racing car

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.499 
if you were lying down in the racing car
and<00:00:12.750> you<00:00:13.710> can<00:00:13.889> hardly<00:00:14.400> see<00:00:14.549> anything<00:00:14.969> except

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
and you can hardly see anything except

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:18.170 
and you can hardly see anything except
the<00:00:15.570> two<00:00:15.780> front<00:00:16.080> tires<00:00:16.260> and<00:00:17.150> something<00:00:18.150> that

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
the two front tires and something that

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.810 
the two front tires and something that
is<00:00:18.390> quite<00:00:18.630> far<00:00:18.869> away<00:00:18.990> so<00:00:19.140> if<00:00:19.650> it's<00:00:19.859> like<00:00:20.070> 20

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
is quite far away so if it's like 20

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.010 
is quite far away so if it's like 20
meters<00:00:21.029> in<00:00:21.150> front<00:00:21.240> of<00:00:21.390> you<00:00:21.480> you<00:00:21.630> couldn't<00:00:21.869> even

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
meters in front of you you couldn't even

feedback from what's going on around him

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.900 
feedback from what's going on around him
it's<00:00:37.320> crucial<00:00:37.860> that<00:00:37.890> he<00:00:38.070> can<00:00:38.219> see<00:00:38.399> as<00:00:38.550> much<00:00:38.760> as

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
it's crucial that he can see as much as

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.910 
it's crucial that he can see as much as
possible<00:00:39.360> of<00:00:39.780> what's<00:00:40.290> ahead<00:00:40.410> of<00:00:40.590> him<00:00:40.739> on<00:00:40.800> the

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
possible of what's ahead of him on the

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.020 
possible of what's ahead of him on the
road<00:00:41.300> yet<00:00:42.300> he<00:00:42.450> has<00:00:42.660> this<00:00:43.170> very<00:00:43.680> small<00:00:44.340> window

road yet he has this very small window
to<00:00:45.270> look<00:00:45.510> out<00:00:45.660> of<00:00:45.719> it's<00:00:46.350> a<00:00:46.440> very<00:00:46.620> well

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
to look out of it's a very well

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.029 
to look out of it's a very well
developed<00:00:47.300> system<00:00:48.300> in<00:00:48.600> which<00:00:48.840> the<00:00:49.500> visors<00:00:49.890> are

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
developed system in which the visors are

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.520 
developed system in which the visors are
tinted<00:00:50.399> for<00:00:50.850> different<00:00:51.449> light<00:00:51.660> situations

bright artificial lighting is very
different<00:00:58.140> from<00:00:58.440> a<00:00:58.590> bright<00:00:58.800> day<00:00:58.829> in<00:00:59.190> Brazil<00:01:02.329> we

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
different from a bright day in Brazil we

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:04.729 
different from a bright day in Brazil we
can<00:01:03.510> see<00:01:03.690> a<00:01:03.719> little<00:01:03.989> bit<00:01:04.170> left<00:01:04.409> and<00:01:04.619> right

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
can see a little bit left and right

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.070 
can see a little bit left and right
sometimes<00:01:05.070> so<00:01:05.820> what<00:01:05.970> we<00:01:06.060> do<00:01:06.210> going<00:01:06.810> down<00:01:06.960> the

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
sometimes so what we do going down the

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.170 
sometimes so what we do going down the
straight<00:01:07.350> is<00:01:07.619> we<00:01:07.830> look<00:01:07.979> out<00:01:08.159> on<00:01:08.400> the<00:01:08.460> left<00:01:08.729> to

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
straight is we look out on the left to

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:10.399 
straight is we look out on the left to
see<00:01:09.360> if<00:01:09.479> we<00:01:09.600> can<00:01:09.750> see<00:01:09.930> some<00:01:10.170> sort<00:01:10.320> of

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
see if we can see some sort of

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:13.039 
see if we can see some sort of
billboards<00:01:11.010> or<00:01:11.610> anything<00:01:12.030> as<00:01:12.150> such<00:01:12.330> that<00:01:12.930> will

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
billboards or anything as such that will

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:14.630 
billboards or anything as such that will
give<00:01:13.200> us<00:01:13.290> an<00:01:13.439> indication<00:01:13.530> of<00:01:14.130> where<00:01:14.280> we<00:01:14.430> are<00:01:14.460> on

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
give us an indication of where we are on

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.090 
give us an indication of where we are on
the<00:01:14.700> track<00:01:14.909> and<00:01:15.229> makes<00:01:16.229> allows<00:01:16.799> us<00:01:16.950> to

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
the track and makes allows us to

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.399 
the track and makes allows us to
understand<00:01:17.490> when<00:01:18.210> might<00:01:18.720> our<00:01:18.960> breaking<00:01:19.380> point

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
understand when might our breaking point

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.620 
understand when might our breaking point
arrive<00:01:19.920> so<00:01:20.460> it's<00:01:20.610> it's<00:01:21.060> very<00:01:21.360> very<00:01:21.600> difficult

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
arrive so it's it's very very difficult

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.630 
arrive so it's it's very very difficult
the<00:01:22.500> only<00:01:22.740> help<00:01:22.920> we<00:01:23.100> have<00:01:23.280> in<00:01:23.430> such<00:01:23.610> a

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
the only help we have in such a

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.010 
the only help we have in such a
situation<00:01:23.970> is<00:01:24.540> tariffs<00:01:25.530> on<00:01:26.310> our<00:01:26.460> helmet<00:01:26.790> and

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:27.020 
situation is tariffs on our helmet and

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:29.630 
situation is tariffs on our helmet and
because<00:01:28.020> if<00:01:28.170> everything<00:01:29.070> becomes<00:01:29.369> extremely

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
because if everything becomes extremely

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.420 
because if everything becomes extremely
dirty<00:01:30.000> you<00:01:30.810> hardly<00:01:31.380> can<00:01:31.560> see<00:01:31.740> anything<00:01:32.159> so<00:01:32.400> I

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
dirty you hardly can see anything so I

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:33.920 
dirty you hardly can see anything so I
can<00:01:32.670> pull<00:01:32.850> it<00:01:32.939> off<00:01:33.030> and<00:01:33.329> then<00:01:33.360> I<00:01:33.540> have<00:01:33.659> clear

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
can pull it off and then I have clear

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.560 
can pull it off and then I have clear
visibility<00:01:34.079> again<00:01:34.740> for<00:01:35.280> a<00:01:35.310> few<00:01:35.579> laps<00:01:35.790> and<00:01:36.090> then

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
visibility again for a few laps and then

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.030 
visibility again for a few laps and then
I<00:01:36.630> need<00:01:36.780> to<00:01:36.869> pull<00:01:37.049> the<00:01:37.110> next<00:01:37.320> one<00:01:37.470> off<00:01:37.590> and<00:01:37.860> I

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
I need to pull the next one off and I

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.380 
I need to pull the next one off and I
just<00:01:38.310> hope<00:01:38.460> that<00:01:38.490> I<00:01:38.640> have<00:01:38.790> enough<00:01:39.030> of<00:01:39.090> them<00:01:39.270> on

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
just hope that I have enough of them on

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.780 
just hope that I have enough of them on
until<00:01:39.659> the<00:01:40.200> end<00:01:40.320> of<00:01:40.409> the<00:01:40.470> race

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:43.790 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:46.550 

when<00:01:44.790> it<00:01:44.880> rains<00:01:45.060> when<00:01:45.660> it's<00:01:45.810> sunny<00:01:46.020> when<00:01:46.440> it's

when it rains when it's sunny when it's

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.060 
when it rains when it's sunny when it's
darker<00:01:47.040> we<00:01:47.430> have<00:01:47.550> to<00:01:47.670> be<00:01:47.700> changing<00:01:48.180> visors<00:01:48.630> and

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:49.070 
darker we have to be changing visors and

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:51.110 
darker we have to be changing visors and
tear<00:01:50.070> offs<00:01:50.280> to<00:01:50.580> give<00:01:50.700> them<00:01:50.820> the<00:01:50.940> opportunity

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:51.120 
tear offs to give them the opportunity

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:53.210 
tear offs to give them the opportunity
to<00:01:51.540> clear<00:01:52.140> their<00:01:52.350> visor<00:01:52.530> when<00:01:52.770> it<00:01:52.860> gets<00:01:53.010> wet

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
to clear their visor when it gets wet

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.510 
to clear their visor when it gets wet
and<00:01:53.460> covered<00:01:54.390> in<00:01:54.600> mud<00:01:54.780> all<00:01:55.680> these<00:01:55.950> scenarios

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
and covered in mud all these scenarios

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.450 
and covered in mud all these scenarios
which<00:01:57.240> effectively<00:01:58.080> lead<00:01:58.860> the<00:01:58.890> driver<00:01:59.220> to

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
which effectively lead the driver to

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.520 
which effectively lead the driver to
give<00:01:59.610> him<00:01:59.730> the<00:02:00.330> best<00:02:00.570> possible<00:02:00.810> vision<00:02:01.380> of

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
give him the best possible vision of
