00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:07.800 
has a point value and so you can like

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:09.680 
has a point value and so you can like
take<00:03:08.220> a<00:03:08.250> whole<00:03:08.580> bunch<00:03:08.880> small<00:03:09.330> point<00:03:09.569> view

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:09.690 
take a whole bunch small point view

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:11.479 
take a whole bunch small point view
value<00:03:10.170> units<00:03:10.440> we<00:03:10.500> can<00:03:10.650> take<00:03:10.769> less<00:03:11.100> and<00:03:11.400> a

00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:11.489 
value units we can take less and a

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:13.309 
value units we can take less and a
bigger<00:03:11.760> more<00:03:11.970> powerful<00:03:12.000> units<00:03:12.690> and<00:03:12.870> that's

00:03:13.309 --> 00:03:13.319 
bigger more powerful units and that's

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:14.300

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:07.180 
head around because when people think of

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:09.360 
head around because when people think of
MMO<00:04:07.659> they<00:04:07.900> think<00:04:08.110> of<00:04:08.200> MMORPG<00:04:08.980> and<00:04:09.099> they<00:04:09.159> think

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:10.750 
of an avatar and then they think of

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:13.020 
of an avatar and then they think of
dressing<00:04:11.620> them<00:04:11.739> up<00:04:11.859> and<00:04:12.250> putting<00:04:12.430> cool<00:04:12.670> armor
