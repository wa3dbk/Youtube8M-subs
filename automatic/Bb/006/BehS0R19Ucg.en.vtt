is great which the great relationship
there<00:00:33.219> um<00:00:33.670> the<00:00:34.149> problem<00:00:34.360> is<00:00:34.690> some<00:00:34.899> punching<00:00:35.200> a

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:35.260 
there um the problem is some punching a

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.350 
there um the problem is some punching a
breast<00:00:35.500> gets<00:00:35.680> a<00:00:35.770> little<00:00:35.980> restrictive<00:00:36.879> and<00:00:37.270> how

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:37.360 
breast gets a little restrictive and how

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:39.060 
breast gets a little restrictive and how
you<00:00:37.420> can<00:00:37.600> cook<00:00:37.780> it<00:00:37.960> because<00:00:38.320> it<00:00:38.590> dries<00:00:38.920> out

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:39.070 
you can cook it because it dries out

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:42.150 
you can cook it because it dries out
really<00:00:39.129> quickly<00:00:40.500> it's<00:00:41.500> hard<00:00:41.800> to<00:00:41.890> cook

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:42.160 
really quickly it's hard to cook

00:00:44.819 --> 00:00:44.829 
properly unless you have to be a machine

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:53.090 
there about two branches should do the

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:54.640 
there about two branches should do the
trick<00:01:53.360> to<00:01:53.540> just<00:01:53.750> make<00:01:53.930> sure<00:01:54.140> we<00:01:54.260> have<00:01:54.290> said

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:54.650 
trick to just make sure we have said

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:56.560

that<00:01:54.770> flavor<00:01:55.100> that<00:01:55.370> just<00:01:55.400> removes<00:01:55.640> too<00:01:56.300> nicely

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:56.570 
that flavor that just removes too nicely

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:00.960

chicken and then we're gonna leave that
overnight<00:03:13.670> twelve<00:03:14.180> hours<00:03:14.540> and<00:03:14.720> some<00:03:14.870> baggies

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:15.320 
overnight twelve hours and some baggies

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:19.590

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:21.950

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:27.980 
probably going to eat this in about two

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:31.420 
probably going to eat this in about two
days<00:03:29.350> when<00:03:30.350> we're<00:03:30.560> good<00:03:30.860> to<00:03:31.130> go

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:31.430 
days when we're good to go

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:34.300 
days when we're good to go
this<00:03:31.730> is<00:03:31.880> going<00:03:32.000> to<00:03:32.090> be<00:03:32.150> very<00:03:32.360> simple<00:03:33.290> and<00:03:33.470> fast

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:34.310 
this is going to be very simple and fast

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:36.010 
this is going to be very simple and fast
I'm<00:03:34.640> just<00:03:34.760> going<00:03:34.910> to<00:03:35.000> take<00:03:35.180> some<00:03:35.210> olive<00:03:35.690> oil

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:40.070 
and spread it move it everywhere want to

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:42.700 
and spread it move it everywhere want to
just<00:03:40.460> make<00:03:41.360> pounding<00:03:41.750> this<00:03:41.900> and<00:03:42.320> we<00:03:42.500> have<00:03:42.680> a

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:42.710 
just make pounding this and we have a

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:44.350 
just make pounding this and we have a
grill<00:03:43.040> which<00:03:43.220> I<00:03:43.400> don't<00:03:43.460> have<00:03:43.880> and<00:03:44.060> I<00:03:44.090> really

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:44.360 
grill which I don't have and I really

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:45.100

wish I did

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:47.080 
wish I did
I'd<00:03:45.320> put<00:03:45.590> it<00:03:45.680> on<00:03:45.770> that<00:03:45.950> but<00:03:46.190> since<00:03:46.370> I<00:03:46.490> don't<00:03:46.700> own

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:47.090 
I'd put it on that but since I don't own

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:50.910 
I'd put it on that but since I don't own

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:33.300 
after about 30 minutes you'll see that
some<00:04:31.810> oil<00:04:32.080> render<00:04:32.440> down<00:04:32.590> and<00:04:32.830> this<00:04:32.890> is<00:04:32.950> where

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:33.310 
some oil render down and this is where

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:36.060 
some oil render down and this is where
why<00:04:34.090> it<00:04:34.150> grill<00:04:34.570> would<00:04:34.810> be<00:04:34.960> better<00:04:35.200> I'm<00:04:35.890> just

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:36.070 
why it grill would be better I'm just

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:42.180 
why it grill would be better I'm just
going<00:04:36.310> to<00:04:36.400> reduce<00:04:36.520> remove<00:04:37.320> all<00:04:38.320> the<00:04:38.530> fat<00:04:41.190> about

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:42.190 
going to reduce remove all the fat about

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:44.640 
going to reduce remove all the fat about
one<00:04:42.610> hour<00:04:42.850> in<00:04:43.360> you'll<00:04:44.050> see<00:04:44.290> that<00:04:44.440> they've

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:44.650 
one hour in you'll see that they've

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:46.290 
one hour in you'll see that they've
become<00:04:44.800> nice<00:04:45.250> and<00:04:45.580> caramelized

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:46.300 
become nice and caramelized

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:49.440 
become nice and caramelized
just<00:04:46.600> as<00:04:46.720> so<00:04:47.130> and<00:04:48.130> what<00:04:48.520> I<00:04:48.550> did<00:04:48.760> is<00:04:48.880> I<00:04:48.970> put<00:04:49.180> it<00:04:49.270> up

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:49.450 
just as so and what I did is I put it up

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:51.810 
just as so and what I did is I put it up
to<00:04:49.480> right<00:04:50.290> here<00:04:50.530> if<00:04:50.590> you<00:04:50.680> can<00:04:50.770> see<00:04:50.800> that<00:04:51.190> I<00:04:51.400> can

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:51.820 
to right here if you can see that I can

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:53.580 
to right here if you can see that I can
see<00:04:51.970> that<00:04:52.150> basically<00:04:52.870> I<00:04:52.960> put<00:04:53.080> the<00:04:53.170> grill<00:04:53.380> top

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:53.590 
see that basically I put the grill top

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:57.210 
see that basically I put the grill top
on<00:04:54.120> so<00:04:55.120> you'll<00:04:55.270> be<00:04:55.390> able<00:04:55.540> to<00:04:56.050> caramelize<00:04:56.980> the

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:57.220 
on so you'll be able to caramelize the

00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:58.800 
on so you'll be able to caramelize the
top<00:04:57.580> of<00:04:57.850> the<00:04:57.940> chickens<00:04:58.300> and<00:04:58.420> get<00:04:58.570> that<00:04:58.690> nice
