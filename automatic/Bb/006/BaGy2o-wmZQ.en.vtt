here<00:00:33.180> you<00:00:33.329> could<00:00:33.510> see<00:00:33.540> first<00:00:34.320> you're<00:00:34.559> going<00:00:34.649> to

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
here you could see first you're going to

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:35.930 
here you could see first you're going to
look<00:00:34.860> first<00:00:35.250> I'm<00:00:35.460> going<00:00:35.550> to<00:00:35.610> pinch<00:00:35.850> the

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
look first I'm going to pinch the

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.700 
look first I'm going to pinch the
offensive<00:00:36.420> line<00:00:36.570> down<00:00:36.989> that's<00:00:37.230> first<00:00:37.410> of<00:00:37.559> all

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
offensive line down that's first of all

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.889 
offensive line down that's first of all
the<00:00:38.370> center<00:00:38.760> you<00:00:38.790> see<00:00:38.940> is<00:00:39.270> attacking<00:00:39.780> the

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
the center you see is attacking the

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:42.350 
the center you see is attacking the
middle<00:00:40.200> linebacker<00:00:40.620> we<00:00:41.309> have<00:00:41.399> a<00:00:41.430> double<00:00:42.149> team

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
middle linebacker we have a double team

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.110 
middle linebacker we have a double team
with<00:00:42.570> the<00:00:42.660> right<00:00:42.960> tackle<00:00:43.410> and<00:00:43.559> tight<00:00:43.770> end

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:44.120 
with the right tackle and tight end

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:47.330 
with the right tackle and tight end
eventually<00:00:45.120> with<00:00:45.660> double<00:00:46.020> teams<00:00:46.260> one<00:00:47.100> of<00:00:47.250> them

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
eventually with double teams one of them

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:48.650 
eventually with double teams one of them
is<00:00:47.370> going<00:00:47.640> to<00:00:47.760> get<00:00:47.940> off<00:00:48.059> the<00:00:48.149> block<00:00:48.390> so

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
is going to get off the block so

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.959 
is going to get off the block so
typically<00:00:49.260> it's<00:00:49.469> the<00:00:49.649> tight<00:00:49.860> end<00:00:50.100> I'm<00:00:50.730> gonna

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
typically it's the tight end I'm gonna

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:54.170 
typically it's the tight end I'm gonna
go<00:00:51.239> towards<00:00:51.809> them<00:00:52.340> just<00:00:53.340> so<00:00:53.579> that<00:00:53.610> the<00:00:53.940> tight

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
go towards them just so that the tight

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.600 
go towards them just so that the tight
end<00:00:54.449> will<00:00:54.719> go<00:00:54.989> and<00:00:55.199> block<00:00:55.559> the<00:00:56.070> right<00:00:56.399> outside

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
end will go and block the right outside

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.459 
end will go and block the right outside
linebacker<00:00:56.969> so<00:00:57.390> I<00:00:57.420> wait<00:00:57.660> until<00:00:57.809> he<00:00:58.050> blocks<00:00:58.289> all

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
linebacker so I wait until he blocks all

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.650 
linebacker so I wait until he blocks all
right<00:00:58.590> outside<00:00:58.739> linebacker<00:00:59.180> then<00:01:00.180> I<00:01:00.210> cut<00:01:00.539> to

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
right outside linebacker then I cut to

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.840 
right outside linebacker then I cut to
the<00:01:00.780> outside<00:01:00.809> and<00:01:01.710> i<00:01:01.739> have<00:01:01.890> my<00:01:02.039> lead<00:01:02.309> blocking

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
the outside and i have my lead blocking

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.579 
the outside and i have my lead blocking
fullback<00:01:03.059> there<00:01:03.510> in<00:01:03.960> which<00:01:04.140> i<00:01:04.260> could<00:01:04.320> go<00:01:04.530> to

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
fullback there in which i could go to

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.170 
fullback there in which i could go to
the<00:01:04.710> left<00:01:05.040> or<00:01:05.250> to<00:01:05.309> the<00:01:05.640> right<00:01:05.729> of<00:01:06.030> him

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
the left or to the right of him

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.600 
the left or to the right of him
depending<00:01:07.020> on<00:01:07.020> how<00:01:07.380> our<00:01:07.680> opponent<00:01:08.430> user

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
depending on how our opponent user

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.560 
depending on how our opponent user
defends<00:01:09.090> it<00:01:09.770> so<00:01:10.770> if<00:01:11.100> i<00:01:11.790> play<00:01:12.060> it<00:01:12.090> like<00:01:12.360> this

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
defends it so if i play it like this

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.630 
defends it so if i play it like this
going<00:01:12.840> diagonally<00:01:13.470> i<00:01:13.619> start<00:01:14.040> off<00:01:14.250> the<00:01:14.400> run

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
going diagonally i start off the run

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.940 
going diagonally i start off the run
with<00:01:14.820> three<00:01:15.150> blockers<00:01:15.659> my<00:01:16.320> tight<00:01:16.590> end<00:01:16.770> my

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
with three blockers my tight end my

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.160 
with three blockers my tight end my
right<00:01:17.130> tackle<00:01:17.580> my<00:01:17.700> fullback<00:01:18.090> and<00:01:18.330> there's<00:01:18.900> no

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
right tackle my fullback and there's no

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.620 
right tackle my fullback and there's no
way<00:01:19.439> that<00:01:19.710> they're<00:01:20.040> gonna<00:01:20.189> get<00:01:20.460> in<00:01:20.729> if<00:01:20.939> i<00:01:21.330> do<00:01:21.390> it

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
way that they're gonna get in if i do it

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.749 
way that they're gonna get in if i do it
like<00:01:21.659> that<00:01:21.900> and<00:01:21.960> here<00:01:22.259> you<00:01:22.380> could<00:01:22.530> see<00:01:22.759> the

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
like that and here you could see the

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.490 
like that and here you could see the
worst<00:01:24.090> way<00:01:24.420> to<00:01:24.450> run<00:01:24.840> the<00:01:24.930> stretch<00:01:25.170> and<00:01:25.200> that's

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
worst way to run the stretch and that's

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.070 
worst way to run the stretch and that's
to<00:01:25.650> go<00:01:25.799> outside<00:01:26.250> in<00:01:26.549> the<00:01:26.880> beginning<00:01:27.360> here<00:01:28.049> i

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
to go outside in the beginning here i

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.690 
to go outside in the beginning here i
have<00:01:28.200> a<00:01:28.350> double-team<00:01:28.890> just<00:01:29.220> like<00:01:29.369> the<00:01:29.490> other

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
have a double-team just like the other

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.789 
have a double-team just like the other
play<00:01:30.090> but<00:01:30.659> i<00:01:30.689> didn't<00:01:31.020> give<00:01:31.200> my<00:01:31.380> tight<00:01:31.619> end

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
play but i didn't give my tight end

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:33.620 
play but i didn't give my tight end
enough<00:01:32.130> time<00:01:32.400> to<00:01:32.850> block<00:01:33.119> that<00:01:33.270> right<00:01:33.479> outside

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
enough time to block that right outside

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.960 
enough time to block that right outside
linebacker<00:01:34.340> the<00:01:35.340> way<00:01:35.460> we're<00:01:35.640> running<00:01:35.880> a

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
linebacker the way we're running a

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.520 
linebacker the way we're running a
stretch<00:01:36.270> is<00:01:36.479> the<00:01:36.930> best<00:01:37.200> in<00:01:37.350> my<00:01:37.500> opinion

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
stretch is the best in my opinion

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.219 
stretch is the best in my opinion
because<00:01:38.009> it<00:01:38.280> prevents<00:01:38.729> an<00:01:38.820> opponent<00:01:39.299> from

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
because it prevents an opponent from

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:41.899 
because it prevents an opponent from
taking<00:01:40.740> their<00:01:40.860> safety<00:01:41.310> i'm<00:01:41.460> running<00:01:41.700> to<00:01:41.729> the

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
taking their safety i'm running to the

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.700 
taking their safety i'm running to the
outside<00:01:42.360> since<00:01:42.780> we're<00:01:42.930> going<00:01:43.079> to<00:01:43.229> the<00:01:43.320> inside

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
outside since we're going to the inside

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.069 
outside since we're going to the inside
first<00:01:44.009> before<00:01:44.340> breaking<00:01:44.700> out<00:01:44.850> or<00:01:45.090> from<00:01:45.810> going

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
first before breaking out or from going

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:47.840 
first before breaking out or from going
to<00:01:46.200> the<00:01:46.229> inside<00:01:46.740> to<00:01:47.040> get<00:01:47.159> through<00:01:47.460> like<00:01:47.670> the<00:01:47.700> a

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
to the inside to get through like the a

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.639 
to the inside to get through like the a
gap<00:01:48.149> because<00:01:48.869> we're<00:01:49.020> pinching<00:01:49.229> the<00:01:49.470> line

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
gap because we're pinching the line

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.770 
gap because we're pinching the line
first<00:01:49.890> here<00:01:50.700> i'm<00:01:50.820> looking<00:01:51.090> at<00:01:51.210> the<00:01:51.360> inside

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
first here i'm looking at the inside

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.660 
first here i'm looking at the inside
zone<00:01:52.079> and<00:01:52.380> the<00:01:52.890> plate<00:01:53.100> looks<00:01:53.250> very<00:01:53.460> similar

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
zone and the plate looks very similar

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.999 
zone and the plate looks very similar
i'm<00:01:53.939> also<00:01:54.090> going<00:01:54.299> to<00:01:54.360> pinch<00:01:54.630> the<00:01:54.720> line<00:01:55.079> as<00:01:55.320> you

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
i'm also going to pinch the line as you

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:57.980 
i'm also going to pinch the line as you
can<00:01:56.100> see<00:01:56.280> look<00:01:56.579> like<00:01:56.729> the<00:01:56.850> stretch<00:01:57.149> initially

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
can see look like the stretch initially

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.620 
can see look like the stretch initially
but<00:01:58.920> you'll<00:01:59.130> notice<00:01:59.399> that<00:01:59.850> the<00:02:00.210> blocking

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
but you'll notice that the blocking

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.600 
but you'll notice that the blocking
schemes<00:02:00.899> are<00:02:01.020> different<00:02:01.409> the<00:02:01.979> left<00:02:02.219> guard<00:02:02.430> and

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
schemes are different the left guard and

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.940 
schemes are different the left guard and
center<00:02:02.820> double-team<00:02:03.659> the<00:02:04.049> left<00:02:04.409> defensive

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
center double-team the left defensive

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.709 
center double-team the left defensive
tackle<00:02:05.369> and<00:02:05.460> the<00:02:05.939> right<00:02:06.180> guard<00:02:06.210> and<00:02:06.570> right

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
tackle and the right guard and right

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:09.410 
tackle and the right guard and right
tackle<00:02:07.129> double-team<00:02:08.129> the<00:02:08.520> right<00:02:08.819> d<00:02:09.000> tackle

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
tackle double-team the right d tackle

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.710 
tackle double-team the right d tackle
eventually<00:02:10.410> one<00:02:10.920> on<00:02:11.099> each<00:02:11.310> side<00:02:11.390> will<00:02:12.390> break

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
eventually one on each side will break

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:13.460 
eventually one on each side will break
the

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
the

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.830 
the
team<00:02:13.770> and<00:02:14.010> here<00:02:14.940> you<00:02:15.060> can<00:02:15.210> see<00:02:15.270> that<00:02:15.390> the<00:02:15.540> right

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
team and here you can see that the right

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.230 
team and here you can see that the right
guard<00:02:16.140> is<00:02:16.260> breaking<00:02:16.620> off<00:02:16.770> and<00:02:16.920> guards<00:02:17.670> em<00:02:17.850> goes

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:18.240 
guard is breaking off and guards em goes

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:21.470 
guard is breaking off and guards em goes
to<00:02:18.480> block<00:02:18.690> the<00:02:19.070> linebacker<00:02:20.070> and<00:02:20.400> the<00:02:20.790> center

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
to block the linebacker and the center

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.210 
to block the linebacker and the center
also<00:02:21.660> guards<00:02:22.200> the<00:02:22.290> other<00:02:22.470> linebacker<00:02:23.010> so<00:02:23.190> I

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
also guards the other linebacker so I

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:24.740 
also guards the other linebacker so I
could<00:02:23.370> have<00:02:23.460> took<00:02:23.580> that<00:02:23.640> to<00:02:23.910> the<00:02:23.940> inside<00:02:24.480> right

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
could have took that to the inside right

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:28.640 
could have took that to the inside right
away<00:02:24.780> or<00:02:25.170> also<00:02:25.890> cut<00:02:26.130> back<00:02:26.340> just<00:02:26.730> like<00:02:26.880> I<00:02:27.030> did<00:02:27.650> so

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
away or also cut back just like I did so

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:30.590 
away or also cut back just like I did so
as<00:02:28.830> I<00:02:29.010> come<00:02:29.250> out<00:02:29.490> I'm<00:02:29.760> going<00:02:29.970> to<00:02:30.060> look<00:02:30.210> to<00:02:30.360> see

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:30.600 
as I come out I'm going to look to see

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.510 
as I come out I'm going to look to see
how<00:02:31.140> many<00:02:31.320> guys<00:02:31.530> are<00:02:31.800> on<00:02:31.860> the<00:02:31.950> left<00:02:32.130> side<00:02:32.310> and

either gonna flip the play or I'm gonna
run<00:02:40.080> the<00:02:40.200> inside<00:02:40.500> zone<00:02:40.770> and<00:02:41.070> either<00:02:41.250> go

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:41.460 
run the inside zone and either go

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:43.370 
run the inside zone and either go
straight<00:02:41.730> up<00:02:41.850> the<00:02:41.940> field<00:02:41.970> or<00:02:42.420> cut<00:02:42.930> back<00:02:43.110> to<00:02:43.290> the

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380 
straight up the field or cut back to the

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:46.790 
straight up the field or cut back to the
left<00:02:43.590> opening<00:02:44.250> was<00:02:44.730> right<00:02:45.030> up<00:02:45.120> the<00:02:45.240> field<00:02:45.800> for

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:46.800 
left opening was right up the field for

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:50.000 
left opening was right up the field for
a<00:02:46.830> gain<00:02:47.100> of<00:02:47.130> over<00:02:47.370> five<00:02:47.700> yards<00:02:48.590> the<00:02:49.590> best<00:02:49.830> thing

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
a gain of over five yards the best thing

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:52.370 
a gain of over five yards the best thing
about<00:02:50.040> the<00:02:50.340> inside<00:02:50.730> zone<00:02:51.000> is<00:02:51.270> that<00:02:51.959> if<00:02:52.050> you<00:02:52.170> run

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380 
about the inside zone is that if you run

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:54.980 
about the inside zone is that if you run
the<00:02:52.530> stretch<00:02:52.800> enough<00:02:53.220> a<00:02:53.459> lot<00:02:54.209> of<00:02:54.240> the<00:02:54.420> times<00:02:54.690> if

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:54.990 
the stretch enough a lot of the times if

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:56.180 
the stretch enough a lot of the times if
they're<00:02:55.140> on<00:02:55.260> a<00:02:55.290> linebacker<00:02:55.740> they're<00:02:55.980> going<00:02:56.130> to

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
they're on a linebacker they're going to

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:58.699 
they're on a linebacker they're going to
run<00:02:56.370> to<00:02:56.520> the<00:02:56.610> outside<00:02:57.020> as<00:02:58.020> soon<00:02:58.320> as<00:02:58.440> they<00:02:58.650> see

00:02:58.699 --> 00:02:58.709 
run to the outside as soon as they see

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:00.199 
run to the outside as soon as they see
that<00:02:59.130> you<00:02:59.250> hike<00:02:59.400> the<00:02:59.550> ball<00:02:59.670> and<00:02:59.850> it's<00:02:59.970> a<00:03:00.030> run

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:00.209 
that you hike the ball and it's a run

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:02.240 
that you hike the ball and it's a run
play<00:03:00.420> so<00:03:01.140> mixing<00:03:01.500> in<00:03:01.650> the<00:03:01.680> stretch<00:03:02.040> with<00:03:02.220> the

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
play so mixing in the stretch with the

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:04.520 
play so mixing in the stretch with the
inside<00:03:02.640> zone<00:03:02.880> is<00:03:03.120> very<00:03:03.450> lethal<00:03:03.780> because

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
inside zone is very lethal because

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:06.050 
inside zone is very lethal because
they'll<00:03:04.740> never<00:03:04.860> know<00:03:05.190> if<00:03:05.459> you're<00:03:05.940> either

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
they'll never know if you're either

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:07.610 
they'll never know if you're either
going<00:03:06.330> to<00:03:06.480> the<00:03:06.660> outside<00:03:07.050> breaking<00:03:07.260> it<00:03:07.440> off

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620 
going to the outside breaking it off

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:10.160 
going to the outside breaking it off
tackle<00:03:07.920> going<00:03:08.730> to<00:03:08.850> the<00:03:08.940> inside<00:03:09.360> or<00:03:09.660> actually

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
tackle going to the inside or actually

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:12.980 
tackle going to the inside or actually
cutting<00:03:10.470> it<00:03:10.709> back<00:03:10.860> to<00:03:11.730> the<00:03:11.850> left<00:03:12.060> and<00:03:12.300> mixing

mix it up by putting the tight end us on

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:42.470 
mix it up by putting the tight end us on
a<00:03:39.540> slant<00:03:40.019> so<00:03:40.350> that<00:03:40.530> after<00:03:41.489> our<00:03:41.519> opponent<00:03:42.299> sees

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480 
a slant so that after our opponent sees

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:44.780 
a slant so that after our opponent sees
that<00:03:42.630> it's<00:03:42.780> not<00:03:42.930> a<00:03:42.989> run<00:03:43.380> he<00:03:44.130> has<00:03:44.160> to<00:03:44.459> go<00:03:44.610> and

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:44.790 
that it's not a run he has to go and

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:47.180 
that it's not a run he has to go and
guard<00:03:44.970> something<00:03:45.450> so<00:03:45.630> the<00:03:45.780> tight<00:03:45.989> end<00:03:46.200> and<00:03:46.380> the

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:47.190 
guard something so the tight end and the

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:49.039 
guard something so the tight end and the
full-back<00:03:47.519> are<00:03:47.700> not<00:03:47.970> near<00:03:48.209> each<00:03:48.330> other<00:03:48.450> here

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:54.450 
manually guarded together so I don't

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:56.660 
manually guarded together so I don't
like<00:03:54.570> to<00:03:54.600> do<00:03:54.810> that<00:03:54.930> too<00:03:55.110> much<00:03:55.340> here<00:03:56.340> with<00:03:56.549> the

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:56.670 
like to do that too much here with the

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:58.340 
like to do that too much here with the

slant<00:03:58.620> and<00:03:58.799> then<00:03:58.920> you<00:03:58.980> could<00:03:59.160> wait<00:03:59.400> and<00:03:59.640> hit

00:03:59.810 --> 00:03:59.820 
slant and then you could wait and hit

slant and then you could wait and hit
the<00:03:59.970> full-back<00:04:00.420> either<00:04:00.959> right<00:04:01.290> away<00:04:01.530> or<00:04:01.830> as
