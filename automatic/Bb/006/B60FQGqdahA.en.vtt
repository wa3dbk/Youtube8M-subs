00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:41.530
 these scales 

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:46.060
 no 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:11.860
 no 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.450
 she 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.170
 it's really what she qualified we attract from these researchers 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.560
 rens 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:50.580
 duo 

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:58.100
 it's a place it has 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:59.030
 4 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:03.880
 LagardÃ¨re has, by the same token, the star of the Karzai Park 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:09.560
 2007 in madrid enclosing them in the shadows this time more than the double 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:12.309
 click but in the trash the speed 

00:02:12.309 --> 00:02:15.369
 to circumscribe the statistic exists even more 

00:02:22.339 --> 00:02:25.679
 the common me I liked the crtc 

00:02:25.679 --> 00:02:27.179
 with a casting 

00:02:27.179 --> 00:02:29.519
 as for personal involvement 

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:31.070
 they were 42 dead 

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:34.070
 cable or satellite 

00:02:39.509 --> 00:02:42.509
 why do you think we have to see 

00:02:44.229 --> 00:02:47.229
 thanks to an unlimited 5 package 

00:02:47.749 --> 00:02:49.099
 the alarm 

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:51.629
 but it 

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:53.859
 lee 

00:02:53.859 --> 00:03:01.879
 louis so msci up means to bring all this month yes a 

00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:04.999
 communicated while learning 

00:03:04.999 --> 00:03:07.999
 researchers and lights 

00:03:09.579 --> 00:03:12.579
 not at all 

00:03:25.679 --> 00:03:28.679
 because 

00:03:35.139 --> 00:03:37.299
 for didier daeninckx 

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:39.129
 and then I ask you a question 

00:03:39.129 --> 00:03:41.159
 a little character 

00:03:41.159 --> 00:03:44.259
 personal and intimate 

00:03:44.259 --> 00:03:48.619
 when you connect an external hard drive via an employer portal do you 

00:03:48.619 --> 00:03:51.249
 dreading a dried blood bath and I immediately understood what I like 

00:03:51.249 --> 00:03:54.249
 what is finished 

00:03:55.219 --> 00:03:58.219
 maybe it was a little too discreet 

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:10.769
 34 3% in May 

00:04:11.669 --> 00:04:13.309
 what 

00:04:13.309 --> 00:04:15.269
 mayence has planted again 

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:16.299
 to allow m 

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:17.529
 not at all 

00:04:17.529 --> 00:04:18.909
 Conversely 

00:04:18.909 --> 00:04:23.990
 rather stable a little soft that should make your life easier couple and that's it 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:26.990
 your installation it ran successfully 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:30.719
 expo 

00:04:30.719 --> 00:04:33.099
 it is located 

00:04:33.099 --> 00:04:33.960
 no 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:37.120
 in this canton is also mayor of beziers with his pals and daily 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:39.460
 marked that an installation was successful 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:42.889
 we still imagine that in the computer programs it's like 

00:04:42.889 --> 00:04:45.020
 a small business pot to celebrate 

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:49.699
 he is very well played and flirty once again we escaped at the ball 

00:04:49.699 --> 00:04:50.559
 starting 

00:04:50.559 --> 00:04:55.650
 and in central america it is above all a work of equipped 1 eto'o 

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:57.969
 that's why this little spades 

00:04:57.969 --> 00:05:01.439
 it is expensive 

00:05:01.439 --> 00:05:03.680
 it feels good to laugh 

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:04.450
 a crazy good
