so<00:00:11.099> you'd<00:00:11.429> like<00:00:11.610> to<00:00:11.759> know<00:00:11.880> about<00:00:12.000> the<00:00:12.440> training

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
so you'd like to know about the training

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.330 
so you'd like to know about the training
paces<00:00:13.980> and<00:00:14.280> how<00:00:14.490> we<00:00:14.549> came<00:00:14.790> up<00:00:14.849> with<00:00:15.120> those<00:00:16.340> it's

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.620 
paces and how we came up with those it's
kind<00:00:18.090> of<00:00:18.150> a<00:00:18.270> two-fold<00:00:18.529> situation<00:00:19.529> one<00:00:20.279> is<00:00:20.630> we

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630

most<00:01:08.280> by<00:01:08.490> working<00:01:08.760> hard<00:01:09.240> for<00:01:09.600> three<00:01:10.260> or<00:01:10.320> four

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
most by working hard for three or four

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.070 
most by working hard for three or four
minutes<00:01:10.740> five<00:01:10.890> minutes<00:01:10.950> at<00:01:11.340> a<00:01:11.369> time<00:01:11.729> and<00:01:12.080> your

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
minutes five minutes at a time and your

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.560 
minutes five minutes at a time and your
threshold<00:01:13.560> works<00:01:14.280> best<00:01:14.790> if<00:01:15.119> you're<00:01:15.360> working

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
threshold works best if you're working

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.830 
threshold works best if you're working
at<00:01:15.840> about<00:01:16.159> 86<00:01:17.159> 88<00:01:17.490> percent<00:01:18.000> of<00:01:18.119> your<00:01:18.240> vo2<00:01:18.509> max

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
at about 86 88 percent of your vo2 max

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.010 
at about 86 88 percent of your vo2 max
so<00:01:19.130> knowing<00:01:20.130> your<00:01:20.520> race<00:01:20.759> speeds<00:01:21.150> we<00:01:21.420> also<00:01:21.630> know

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
so knowing your race speeds we also know

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.240 
so knowing your race speeds we also know
what<00:01:22.320> speed<00:01:23.159> we<00:01:23.369> can<00:01:23.520> calculate<00:01:23.939> what<00:01:24.570> speed

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:25.250 
what speed we can calculate what speed

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:28.310 
what speed we can calculate what speed
is<00:01:26.250> associated<00:01:26.790> with<00:01:26.970> your<00:01:27.240> aerobic<00:01:28.020> power

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
is associated with your aerobic power

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.469 
is associated with your aerobic power
and<00:01:28.799> then<00:01:29.369> we<00:01:29.579> calculate<00:01:30.270> different

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
and then we calculate different

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.990 
and then we calculate different
fractions<00:01:31.350> of<00:01:31.590> that<00:01:31.799> speed<00:01:32.250> for<00:01:32.520> the

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
fractions of that speed for the

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:47.649 
fractions of that speed for the
different<00:01:33.270> types<00:01:33.450> of<00:01:33.600> training<00:01:34.020> that<00:01:34.049> you<00:01:34.200> do

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:47.659 

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:51.289 

yeah<00:01:48.659> I<00:01:48.689> think<00:01:49.020> one<00:01:49.170> of<00:01:49.200> the<00:01:49.729> another<00:01:50.729> benefit

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
yeah I think one of the another benefit

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.359 
yeah I think one of the another benefit
other<00:01:51.600> than<00:01:51.869> determining<00:01:52.409> training<00:01:52.740> paces<00:01:53.189> is

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
other than determining training paces is

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.399 
other than determining training paces is
is<00:01:53.909> to<00:01:54.090> be<00:01:54.119> able<00:01:54.299> to<00:01:54.420> predict<00:01:54.840> what<00:01:54.960> kind<00:01:55.320> of

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
is to be able to predict what kind of

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.230 
is to be able to predict what kind of
time<00:01:55.770> you<00:01:55.950> might<00:01:56.100> run<00:01:56.399> in<00:01:56.579> a<00:01:56.670> race<00:01:56.880> that<00:01:57.149> you

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
time you might run in a race that you

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.480 
time you might run in a race that you
haven't<00:01:57.509> run<00:01:57.659> recently<00:01:58.229> or<00:01:59.100> maybe<00:01:59.310> you've

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
haven't run recently or maybe you've

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.640 
haven't run recently or maybe you've
never<00:01:59.610> run<00:01:59.880> it<00:02:00.060> at<00:02:00.180> all<00:02:00.390> so<00:02:00.689> you<00:02:00.750> can<00:02:00.960> use

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:02.650 
never run it at all so you can use

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:05.430 
never run it at all so you can use
a<00:02:02.740> recent<00:02:03.550> race<00:02:03.760> time<00:02:04.120> to<00:02:04.450> predict<00:02:04.810> other<00:02:05.080> race

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:05.440 
a recent race time to predict other race

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:08.130 
a recent race time to predict other race
times<00:02:05.770> obviously<00:02:06.730> it's<00:02:07.420> not<00:02:07.570> going<00:02:07.750> to<00:02:07.870> be<00:02:07.990> as

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:08.140 
times obviously it's not going to be as

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:11.790 
times obviously it's not going to be as
accurate<00:02:08.440> say<00:02:09.340> using<00:02:09.640> a<00:02:09.970> 800<00:02:10.540> or<00:02:10.660> 1500<00:02:11.320> time<00:02:11.560> to

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:11.800 
accurate say using a 800 or 1500 time to

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:13.620 
accurate say using a 800 or 1500 time to
predict<00:02:12.100> a<00:02:12.190> marathon<00:02:12.610> as<00:02:12.880> it<00:02:13.030> would<00:02:13.180> be<00:02:13.360> to<00:02:13.480> use

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:13.630 
predict a marathon as it would be to use

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:16.650 
predict a marathon as it would be to use
a<00:02:13.660> half<00:02:13.960> marathon<00:02:14.520> marathon<00:02:15.660> but

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:16.660 
a half marathon marathon but

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:20.760 
a half marathon marathon but
physiologically<00:02:17.640> we<00:02:18.640> can<00:02:18.820> say<00:02:19.090> this<00:02:19.990> this

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:20.770 
physiologically we can say this this

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:23.400 
physiologically we can say this this
race<00:02:21.160> performance<00:02:22.090> is<00:02:22.270> equal<00:02:22.900> to<00:02:23.020> that<00:02:23.170> race

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:23.410 
race performance is equal to that race

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:25.380 
race performance is equal to that race
performance<00:02:24.010> and<00:02:24.580> we<00:02:24.700> came<00:02:24.880> up<00:02:25.000> with<00:02:25.120> a<00:02:25.150> lot<00:02:25.330> of

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:25.390 
performance and we came up with a lot of

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:28.350 
performance and we came up with a lot of
that<00:02:25.630> by<00:02:26.250> testing<00:02:27.250> many<00:02:27.460> many<00:02:27.670> runners<00:02:27.970> over

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:28.360 
that by testing many many runners over

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.510 
that by testing many many runners over
the<00:02:28.570> years<00:02:28.780> in<00:02:29.100> determining<00:02:30.100> what<00:02:30.310> their

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:30.520 
the years in determining what their

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:32.760 
the years in determining what their
aerobic<00:02:30.880> power<00:02:31.240> was<00:02:31.600> what<00:02:31.870> their<00:02:32.050> economy<00:02:32.740> was

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:32.770 
aerobic power was what their economy was

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:37.260 
aerobic power was what their economy was
and<00:02:33.370> what<00:02:34.170> speed<00:02:35.170> they<00:02:35.470> raced<00:02:35.770> at<00:02:36.090> races<00:02:37.090> that
