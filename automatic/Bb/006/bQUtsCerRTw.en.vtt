the<00:02:25.480> answer<00:02:25.750> has<00:02:25.959> always<00:02:26.110> been<00:02:26.260> well<00:02:27.090> there

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.090 
the answer has always been well there

on<00:02:45.220> on<00:02:45.609> the<00:02:45.819> seam<00:02:46.120> so<00:02:46.389> you<00:02:46.450> can<00:02:46.630> when<00:02:46.810> I<00:02:46.870> say<00:02:47.049> a

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:47.079 
on on the seam so you can when I say a

00:02:47.079 --> 00:02:49.080 
on on the seam so you can when I say a
seam<00:02:47.440> it's<00:02:47.680> where<00:02:47.859> the<00:02:48.010> slow<00:02:48.609> water<00:02:48.850> and<00:02:49.030> the

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.090 
seam it's where the slow water and the

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:51.330 
seam it's where the slow water and the
fast<00:02:49.329> water<00:02:49.569> meet<00:02:49.959> you<00:02:50.709> watch<00:02:50.859> those<00:02:51.069> white

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 
fast water meet you watch those white

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:52.680 
fast water meet you watch those white
foam<00:02:51.639> lines<00:02:51.910> and<00:02:52.090> that<00:02:52.180> kind<00:02:52.329> of<00:02:52.359> tells<00:02:52.540> you

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:52.690 
foam lines and that kind of tells you

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:54.120 
foam lines and that kind of tells you
where<00:02:52.840> the<00:02:52.930> main<00:02:53.079> current<00:02:53.410> is<00:02:53.680> which<00:02:53.859> is<00:02:54.010> also

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:54.130 
where the main current is which is also

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:55.530 
where the main current is which is also
in<00:02:54.340> the<00:02:54.400> -<00:02:54.519> that's<00:02:54.700> probably<00:02:54.910> the<00:02:55.000> deeper<00:02:55.299> part

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:55.540 
in the - that's probably the deeper part

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:58.309 
in the - that's probably the deeper part
of<00:02:55.660> the<00:02:55.810> stream<00:02:56.380> so<00:02:56.590> we're<00:02:57.040> gonna<00:02:57.130> focus<00:02:57.400> on<00:02:57.730> is

00:02:58.309 --> 00:02:58.319 
of the stream so we're gonna focus on is

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:00.449 
of the stream so we're gonna focus on is
where<00:02:59.319> these<00:02:59.440> currents<00:02:59.859> kind<00:03:00.040> of<00:03:00.130> come<00:03:00.280> in

00:03:00.449 --> 00:03:00.459 
where these currents kind of come in

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:02.879 
where these currents kind of come in
here<00:03:00.819> and<00:03:01.000> it's<00:03:01.780> a<00:03:01.930> little<00:03:02.230> bit<00:03:02.410> more<00:03:02.530> slacker

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:02.889 
here and it's a little bit more slacker

00:03:02.889 --> 00:03:04.559 
here and it's a little bit more slacker
water<00:03:03.250> there<00:03:03.459> that<00:03:03.609> seam<00:03:04.000> is<00:03:04.209> kind<00:03:04.420> of<00:03:04.480> where

00:03:04.559 --> 00:03:04.569 
water there that seam is kind of where

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:07.259 
water there that seam is kind of where
you<00:03:04.660> want<00:03:04.840> your<00:03:04.989> fly<00:03:05.230> to<00:03:05.290> be<00:03:05.910> yeah<00:03:06.910> you<00:03:07.180> know

00:03:07.259 --> 00:03:07.269 
you want your fly to be yeah you know

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:09.809 
you want your fly to be yeah you know
what<00:03:07.930> I<00:03:07.959> typically<00:03:08.380> do<00:03:08.500> is<00:03:08.560> kind<00:03:08.769> of<00:03:08.829> cast<00:03:09.069> into

00:03:09.809 --> 00:03:09.819 
what I typically do is kind of cast into

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:11.610 
what I typically do is kind of cast into
it<00:03:09.970> and<00:03:10.180> then<00:03:10.599> as<00:03:10.750> your<00:03:10.930> fly<00:03:11.109> is<00:03:11.169> coming<00:03:11.530> down

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:11.620 
it and then as your fly is coming down

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:13.140 
it and then as your fly is coming down
and<00:03:11.799> bouncing<00:03:12.190> along<00:03:12.400> the<00:03:12.549> bottom<00:03:12.730> it's<00:03:13.060> gonna

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:13.150 
and bouncing along the bottom it's gonna

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:15.629 
and bouncing along the bottom it's gonna
kind<00:03:13.480> of<00:03:13.510> swing<00:03:13.810> through<00:03:14.109> here<00:03:14.410> and<00:03:14.739> in<00:03:15.370> fact<00:03:15.519> a

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:15.639 
kind of swing through here and in fact a

00:03:15.639 --> 00:03:17.039 
kind of swing through here and in fact a
lot<00:03:15.790> of<00:03:15.819> times<00:03:15.970> a<00:03:16.299> lot<00:03:16.419> of<00:03:16.480> these<00:03:16.660> steel<00:03:16.930> that

00:03:17.039 --> 00:03:17.049 
lot of times a lot of these steel that

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:18.720 
lot of times a lot of these steel that
will<00:03:17.169> take<00:03:17.380> that<00:03:17.620> fly<00:03:17.889> on<00:03:18.099> the<00:03:18.250> swing<00:03:18.609> because

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:18.730 
will take that fly on the swing because

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:20.339 
will take that fly on the swing because
your<00:03:18.970> fly<00:03:19.150> is<00:03:19.209> kind<00:03:19.450> of<00:03:19.480> coming<00:03:19.660> across<00:03:19.989> the

00:03:20.339 --> 00:03:20.349 
your fly is kind of coming across the

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:21.210 
your fly is kind of coming across the
river

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:21.220 
river

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:23.159

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:19.299 
fish are on the Bob so I'm gonna be

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:20.430 
fish are on the Bob so I'm gonna be
sitting<00:04:19.630> on<00:04:19.690> the<00:04:19.780> bottom<00:04:19.989> they're<00:04:20.139> really

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:20.440 
sitting on the bottom they're really

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:21.750 
sitting on the bottom they're really
close<00:04:20.709> and<00:04:20.919> so<00:04:21.039> what<00:04:21.130> we're<00:04:21.250> trying<00:04:21.340> to<00:04:21.489> do<00:04:21.639> is

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:21.760 
close and so what we're trying to do is

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:25.320 
close and so what we're trying to do is
to<00:04:21.880> get<00:04:22.000> that<00:04:22.150> fly<00:04:22.510> in<00:04:23.139> that<00:04:23.620> strike<00:04:24.130> zone<00:04:24.330> so

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:25.330 
to get that fly in that strike zone so

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:27.570 
to get that fly in that strike zone so
that's<00:04:26.050> where<00:04:26.289> the<00:04:26.410> the<00:04:26.770> sinkers<00:04:27.190> come<00:04:27.430> in

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:27.580 
that's where the the sinkers come in

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:29.760 
that's where the the sinkers come in
with<00:04:27.699> the<00:04:27.789> sights<00:04:28.090> and<00:04:28.330> sounds<00:04:28.630> were<00:04:29.229> almost

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:29.770 
with the sights and sounds were almost

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:33.060 
with the sights and sounds were almost
surreal<00:04:30.400> and<00:04:30.820> Davin's<00:04:31.750> knowledge<00:04:32.169> commanded

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:33.070 
surreal and Davin's knowledge commanded

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:35.370 
surreal and Davin's knowledge commanded
our<00:04:33.220> undivided<00:04:33.520> attention<00:04:33.910> we<00:04:34.780> put<00:04:34.960> a<00:04:34.990> few<00:04:35.199> of

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:35.380 
our undivided attention we put a few of

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:38.100 
our undivided attention we put a few of
the<00:04:35.500> split<00:04:36.280> shots<00:04:36.610> on<00:04:36.849> there<00:04:37.120> so<00:04:37.780> that<00:04:37.960> that

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:38.110 
the split shots on there so that that

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:40.080 
the split shots on there so that that
fly<00:04:38.349> can<00:04:38.710> kind<00:04:38.919> of<00:04:38.979> get<00:04:39.250> down<00:04:39.280> real<00:04:39.729> quick<00:04:39.970> in

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:40.090 
fly can kind of get down real quick in

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:41.339 
fly can kind of get down real quick in
these<00:04:40.210> short<00:04:40.449> little<00:04:40.479> runs<00:04:40.840> and<00:04:41.050> the<00:04:41.110> drift

00:04:41.339 --> 00:04:41.349 
these short little runs and the drift

00:04:41.349 --> 00:04:43.140 
these short little runs and the drift
through<00:04:41.500> there<00:04:41.740> so<00:04:42.400> what<00:04:42.550> we'll<00:04:42.639> do<00:04:42.759> is<00:04:42.789> make

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:43.150 
through there so what we'll do is make

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:44.700 
through there so what we'll do is make
those<00:04:43.599> drifts<00:04:44.080> and<00:04:44.229> you<00:04:44.289> feel<00:04:44.470> like<00:04:44.500> you've

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:44.710 
those drifts and you feel like you've

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:46.080 
those drifts and you feel like you've
made<00:04:44.830> enough<00:04:45.010> drifts<00:04:45.430> for<00:04:45.520> that<00:04:45.610> area<00:04:45.849> then<00:04:46.030> I

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:46.090 
made enough drifts for that area then I

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:47.969 
made enough drifts for that area then I
take<00:04:46.240> a<00:04:46.270> step<00:04:46.570> downstream<00:04:47.169> and<00:04:47.410> do<00:04:47.620> it<00:04:47.740> again

00:04:47.969 --> 00:04:47.979 
take a step downstream and do it again

00:04:47.979 --> 00:04:49.650 
take a step downstream and do it again
and<00:04:48.639> so<00:04:48.789> kind<00:04:48.910> of<00:04:49.030> what<00:04:49.120> you're<00:04:49.240> doing<00:04:49.570> is

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:49.660 
and so kind of what you're doing is

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:50.790 
and so kind of what you're doing is
you're<00:04:49.750> kind<00:04:49.810> of<00:04:49.930> methodically<00:04:50.169> covering

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:50.800 
you're kind of methodically covering

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:53.279 
you're kind of methodically covering
this<00:04:50.919> little<00:04:51.310> run<00:04:51.520> as<00:04:51.729> that<00:04:51.910> fly<00:04:52.090> swings<00:04:52.479> and

00:04:53.279 --> 00:04:53.289 
this little run as that fly swings and

00:04:53.289 --> 00:04:54.689 
this little run as that fly swings and
you<00:04:53.380> take<00:04:53.530> a<00:04:53.560> step<00:04:53.770> down<00:04:53.830> you're<00:04:54.280> really<00:04:54.520> kind

00:04:54.689 --> 00:04:54.699 
you take a step down you're really kind

00:04:54.699 --> 00:04:57.870 
you take a step down you're really kind
of<00:04:54.789> covering<00:04:55.120> that<00:04:55.210> all<00:04:55.449> the<00:04:56.159> the<00:04:57.159> water<00:04:57.370> we
