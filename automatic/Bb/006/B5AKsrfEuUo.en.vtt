00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.510
 the hard reset procedure on the 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:11.580
 php smartphone with model phone 530 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.049
 It is a very simple procedure but 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.969
 helps a lot when you are 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:17.880
 facing a problem related to 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:19.830
 software like milk give errors with 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.410
 applications or in case you have 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.570
 forgotten to send unlock today 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:27.240
 procedure will restore the entire 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.930

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.930
 the files 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:42.989
 so let's go with the device off 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.350
 preferably without the chip and its card 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.350
 from memory 

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:50.430
 you will hold the volume key to 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:53.390
 up and even on and off for 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.390
 few seconds 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:01.640
 When he appeared in the movie you loose 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:07.310
 turn the power off and on and 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:09.500
 holding down the volume key and then 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:12.350
 unit will enter the use mode 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:15.590
 where you go to the option the update factor 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:17.990
 zed with the down arrow key and 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:21.649

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:25.759
 until he goes to turn on and off the 

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:28.250
 yesh and confirm again at this moment 

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:30.050
 it is fully formatting the memory 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:37.340
 the appliance and restoring all 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:38.750
 factory settings ending and 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:43.610
 it returns to the first option of the 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:46.580
 recovery is only you confirm rebussi 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:48.259

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:51.350
