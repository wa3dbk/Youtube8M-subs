00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.050
 Hello today, I present the recipe for a double-paste dove 

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:17.190
 using the sourdough for the first dough I'll use: 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.860
 Manitoba flour, a part of this sourdough 

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:24.770
 which I refreshed several times with Manitoba flour until it started to double by 

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:31.680
 volume in 3-4 hours egg yolks, warm water at 28 ° C, butter 

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:35.390
 which I will then slightly mount and granulated sugar 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:40.720
 first I put 75g of sourdough in the planetary 

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:58.510
 Manitoba flour and sugar and a little at a time add the egg yolks 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:21.340
 always little by little the water 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:24.759
 after 15 minutes the dough starts to detach from the edges 

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:29.909
 and it became smooth and elastic so at the lowest speed I add 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:50.689
 the butter which I slightly softened with a whisk 

00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:56.079
 after incorporating all the butter and after another 15 minutes the dough begins to peel off 

00:01:56.079 --> 00:02:04.149
 from the walls it is ready with the help of flour, a little dough 

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:24.500
 going to form the classic ball 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:29.360
 put back in the container covered with transparent film 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:32.780
 and I will let it rise at a temperature of 25 ° -30 ° C 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:35.920
 away from drafts up to double in volume 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:45.000
 once doubled I prepare the second dough with flour, granulated sugar, egg yolks, 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:53.250
 water, candied fruit, butter which I will then add a pinch of salt, vanillin or seeds 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:56.910
 of vanilla bean then to the first mixture I add 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:03.840
 Manitoba flour, vanillin sugar and a pinch of salt 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:40.310
 at lower speed I gradually incorporate the yolks and then the water 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:43.290
 after 15 minutes the dough starts to detach from the edges 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:04:03.490
 then gradually incorporate the butter that I lightly mounted 

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:05.460
 with the whisk incorporated all the butter when the mixture 

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:08.260
 start off with the edges add the candied fruit 

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:32.090
 after 1 minutes the dough is ready to work a little helping me with the flour 

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:36.940
 I cover the dough with a cloth and let it rest for 30 minutes in this 

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:39.300
 way after 30 minutes 

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:49.490
 I divide the dough into 2 parts I take the mold for a dove 

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:57.630
 and with greasy hands work with melted butter to make the dough this way 

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:17.060
 I make a cylinder 

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:29.870
 in the shape of a "U" with melted butter and the brush grease the surface 

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:35.540
 della Colomba to prevent the skin from forming on the surface 

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:40.830
 cover with a cloth and let rise at a temperature of 25 ° -30 ° C 

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:45.040
 away from drafts until the dough reaches the edge of the mold 

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:48.680
 as you can see the dough has not risen to the edge 

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:52.980
 however it will also grow during cooking before I put it in the oven with a small one 

00:05:52.980 --> 00:06:14.620
 layer of ice for Colombe that I softened with egg white 

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:19.560
 then some almonds and some sugar 

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:38.530
 finally some icing sugar and the Colomba is ready to be cooked 

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:44.360
 I will cook it in a static oven at 180 ° C for 40-45 minutes 

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:53.410
 Perfect the dove is cooked Thanks to the next recipe 

00:06:53.410 --> 00:06:55.220
 HELLO
