the piece that will that is on the

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.640 
the piece that will that is on the
outside<00:00:21.930> will<00:00:22.650> show<00:00:22.949> on<00:00:23.279> your<00:00:23.519> flower<00:00:24.650> open

other way then open that up turn the

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:40.119 
other way then open that up turn the
paper<00:00:37.110> over<00:00:37.710> so<00:00:37.920> the<00:00:38.309> right<00:00:38.550> side<00:00:38.879> shows<00:00:39.270> and

00:00:40.119 --> 00:00:40.129 
paper over so the right side shows and

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:47.569 
paper over so the right side shows and
fold<00:00:41.129> it<00:00:41.430> in<00:00:42.390> half<00:00:45.230> open<00:00:46.230> that<00:00:46.440> up<00:00:46.649> turn<00:00:47.520> it

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
fold it in half open that up turn it

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:52.069 
fold it in half open that up turn it
back<00:00:47.940> over<00:00:49.399> you'll<00:00:50.399> see<00:00:50.730> where<00:00:51.000> you<00:00:51.360> fold<00:00:51.809> the

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
back over you'll see where you fold the

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.939 
back over you'll see where you fold the
paper<00:00:52.320> in<00:00:52.559> half<00:00:52.590> it<00:00:53.129> already<00:00:53.699> wants<00:00:54.120> to<00:00:54.239> go<00:00:54.420> in

00:00:54.939 --> 00:00:54.949 
paper in half it already wants to go in

00:00:54.949 --> 00:00:58.819 
paper in half it already wants to go in
so<00:00:55.949> what<00:00:56.399> you<00:00:56.550> need<00:00:56.699> to<00:00:56.850> do<00:00:57.000> next<00:00:57.239> is<00:00:57.690> to<00:00:58.530> let<00:00:58.710> it

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
so what you need to do next is to let it

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.910 
so what you need to do next is to let it
go<00:00:59.100> in<00:00:59.430> like<00:00:59.879> that<00:01:00.120> so<00:01:00.480> you<00:01:01.230> wind<00:01:01.559> up<00:01:01.710> with<00:01:01.770> a

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
go in like that so you wind up with a

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:08.000 
go in like that so you wind up with a
triangle<00:01:02.520> of<00:01:02.609> paper<00:01:06.020> that<00:01:07.020> opens<00:01:07.530> out<00:01:07.770> a

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
triangle of paper that opens out a

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.870 
triangle of paper that opens out a
little<00:01:08.189> bit<00:01:08.430> like<00:01:08.610> that<00:01:10.280> okay<00:01:11.280> that's<00:01:11.610> the

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
little bit like that okay that's the

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.469 
little bit like that okay that's the
basis<00:01:12.299> for<00:01:12.510> your<00:01:12.659> flower<00:01:13.080> shape<00:01:13.880> now<00:01:14.880> all<00:01:15.299> that

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
basis for your flower shape now all that

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:19.940 
basis for your flower shape now all that
remains<00:01:15.540> is<00:01:16.229> for<00:01:16.290> you<00:01:16.770> to<00:01:16.950> pick<00:01:17.159> up<00:01:18.320> two<00:01:19.320> of<00:01:19.650> the

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
remains is for you to pick up two of the

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.390 
remains is for you to pick up two of the
corners<00:01:20.460> and<00:01:21.380> fold<00:01:22.380> them<00:01:22.590> so<00:01:23.009> that<00:01:23.189> they<00:01:23.369> are

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
corners and fold them so that they are

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.179 
corners and fold them so that they are
they<00:01:23.880> meet<00:01:24.180> in<00:01:24.420> the<00:01:24.479> middle<00:01:24.630> on<00:01:25.049> the<00:01:25.740> back<00:01:25.950> this

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
they meet in the middle on the back this

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:27.969 
they meet in the middle on the back this
will<00:01:26.400> be<00:01:26.520> the<00:01:26.670> back<00:01:26.850> of<00:01:27.030> your<00:01:27.150> flower
