probably like hit with every weapon but
this<00:01:00.449> is<00:01:00.600> from<00:01:00.780> an<00:01:00.930> average<00:01:01.050> fire<00:01:01.649> at<00:01:02.129> the<00:01:02.280> game

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:22.370 
and and that's pretty much it actually

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:27.170

away<00:03:35.310> and<00:03:36.270> i<00:03:36.840> guess<00:03:37.050> that's<00:03:37.290> the<00:03:37.410> end<00:03:37.650> of<00:03:37.920> it

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:38.070 
away and i guess that's the end of it
