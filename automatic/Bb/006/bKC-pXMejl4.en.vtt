00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.640
 salute to all with you jay y on the channel 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:08.400
 jigit the other day we went to a new part 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:10.110
 X-Men of the Last Future 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.360
 I liked the movie further 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.400
 you can't say we liked everything 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.640
 that is, we will say more quantity 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.260
 plus and a little minus we took both 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.600
 It seemed to us three fundamental 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:24.600
 this movie is a script 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.640
 the game of actors and special effects let's start with 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.220
 the script is generally well worth saying for 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:32.070
 start about the movie that made brian 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.899
 singer who shot the first two parts of the X-Men 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.940
 Well, at the same time I must say that the film 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:38.430
 built on the eponymous comic I already 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.140
 did a review on it after 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:44.070
 go to the cinema you must see 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.910
 this video link will be on screen and in 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.149
 video description 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:51.180
 the comic itself was quite brief but 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:53.940
 still was to take as a base and brian 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:56.809
 singer was able to pull out of this foundation all 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:01:00.350
 that all the juice can be pulled out of the film 

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:02.850
 well scripted as opposed to comics 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:03.660
 central character put gay 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.360
 Kitty Pride 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:09.659
 you should have been and put the wolverine 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:12.810
 and naturally there was a fear that again 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:15.119
 Wolverine will be the center of the whole movie 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.830
 and the rest will just be him as a group 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:18.540
 support is actually here so not 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:21.090
 it happened to me and it is very strong 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:23.909
 pleased I am ready to put fat 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:26.280
 plus brian singer for being like that 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:28.140
 correctly distributed movie movie also 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.659
 exactly if the script say 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:33.360
 Naturally, many probably already know 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:35.670
 that the film is accompanied by many 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.439
 inconsistencies previous parts examples 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.909
 docking with the experience of the film to us 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:40.829
 show that they came up with another 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:43.590
 seventies idea were not the first three 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:45.060
 parts when films about the future are made 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.820
 we can travel in time 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:51.090
 write off the fact that there were different and 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:53.490
 not so on but yes here is a big shoal 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:56.189
 let's say in the third part of the boulevard once 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:58.020
 was a black here dwarf 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:00.780
 but I would not say that they are strong 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.670
 cling straight so cool after 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.619
 first class came out and she forgot it 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:07.110
 that is, first grade has already gone so much 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:08.000
 inconsistencies that you are so okay we will 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.280
 think 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.630
 all this did not happen all in 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:13.160
 previous parts 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:15.050
 actually why did that happen 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:16.940
 incompatibility many films were shot 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:18.230
 other directors and screenwriters and they 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:20.630
 brought something of their own 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:22.640
 that I'm more connected sang this picture 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:25.190
 so for the fact that there is no black and 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:28.550
 white as such here there are already four 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:31.280
 parties that pursue some 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:33.770
 common goal but the way to achieve it 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:36.800
 See your own personal I did not like 

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:38.900
 clichÃ© which drove the magnet about anything 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:41.360
 here he is really shown as a fanatic 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:41.870
 so I think fassbender is like 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:44.750
 the actor 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:48.140
 did not give open agree that 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:50.450
 fassbender was framed like 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:52.640
 would say I will return when we go to 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:55.730
 the next topic is the game of actors and here 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:58.610
 The cast is of course very powerful and 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:00.590
 it was immediately clear that acting 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:03.620
 everyone will be on top 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:05.209
 noted and star personalities appeared 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:07.910
 so well for me 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:09.950
 rising star this is evan peters he 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:12.049
 played well there was a lot 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:15.200
 such interpretations about the fact that he is not 

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:18.049
 cope but no mercury turned out very 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:19.880
 dynamic very funny at all super 

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:21.860
 cool character and i was ready 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:24.080
 enjoy from the movie but unfortunately for him 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:25.310
 again, there are only minutes allocated 

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:28.940
 ten screen in time 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:33.100
 if 10 well in general it is not enough but he 

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:35.320
 cool if it continued on 

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:38.090
 push through the film seems to me 

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:39.980
 just solved all the problems yes no 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:41.959
 problems would not arise therefore its like 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:45.260
 A little bit pushed aside and even a big 

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:45.860
 I would like to come across to the guys 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:48.500
 Mark 

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:50.630
 I do not look and I think he still 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:54.470
 little did not depart from their roles in 

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:57.320
 trance and and dirt and so he is 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:59.690
 a little dirty here he got out playing casa 

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:01.280
 the vera of which was allowed to live and that 

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:04.940
 looks pretty cool we mean anyone 

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:08.150
 copes very well yes and I note that 

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:10.130
 because there was little future 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:11.739
 little time spent disclosing characters 

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:14.540
 whom we are used to seeing in 

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:14.959
 previous parts very little holly 

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:18.349
 berry 

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:20.630
 Well, that is, the storm explained that Holly 

00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:21.530
 berry we have a pregnant price and therefore 

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:25.610
 play thunder 

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:28.730
 there fly on these slings with baby 

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:31.100
 inside it would not be much and still I 

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:33.860
 would like to mention jennifer game 

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:36.530
 Lawrence, that is, to play when she tells you 

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:38.840
 I will give either a bunch of makeup or when completely 

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:40.460
 your face stick ut special effects 

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:42.919
 I think it's very hard to have 

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:44.810
 play with your eyes and when else on your eyes 

00:04:42.919 --> 00:04:47.030
 impose special effects that's it of course 

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:49.130
 quite difficult to play together but she 

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:52.010
 handled that is she showed character 

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:55.370
 jennifer well done mystic turned 

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:56.330
 very lively and open well yes and 

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:58.580
 since the image 

00:04:56.330 --> 00:05:00.860
 carry to here more was done by 

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:03.500
 special effects then move on smoothly to them i 

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:06.800
 I would personally like to point out what is natural 

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:09.710
 here they are just dofigischa well for starters 

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:12.470
 I will say that I was not hooked as usual 

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:16.060
 most of all these are guardians in the future they 

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:19.610
 turned out so powerful at the same time 

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:22.600
 killer and nimble robots that 

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:25.250
 By the way, they reminded me a lot 

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:26.600
 the terminators from the second part are the same 

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:28.490
 ductile metal can also 

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:30.860
 recover on the exception 

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:33.229
 that they have certain abilities 

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:34.850
 the guards have but also the language 

00:05:33.229 --> 00:05:36.680
 Spell me not by the fact that they are just 

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:38.870
 hated during the film for being 

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:41.270
 the book says at the beginning is shown very 

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:43.850
 not bad future by the way again 

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:46.280
 recalled just the terminator entry 

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:47.440
 the first part where there tanks go on 

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:49.970
 skulls and all that 

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:53.330
 I would like to say that the magnet is here 

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:56.090
 further personally in my opinion for the movie 

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:58.190
 too much strength he's just here 

00:05:56.090 --> 00:06:00.169
 unreal cool just atomic 

00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:02.510
 level is ruled by metal not at the expense of 

00:06:00.169 --> 00:06:05.840
 some kind of electromagnetic force is simple 

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:10.100
 just i can all verse from metal yet 

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:12.080
 funny what's in the last battle of the magnet 

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:12.440
 can be said at its zenith 

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:14.690
 simu 

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:17.419
 his mutans cue older has a very 

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:20.590
 many years and he is somehow dragging 

00:06:17.419 --> 00:06:23.770
 the bridge there he is generally just to push 

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:25.450
 incredibly dragging the brain into it was 

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:25.750
 of course very cool but here he is 

00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:28.480
 like 

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:30.480
 why don't I move the stadium 

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:32.860
 let me just do it 

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:34.990
 Well, in conclusion I want to say that 

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:37.390
 as you see the film is much more 

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:40.660
 fatty just such advantages than some 

00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:43.060
 small cons due to what we her 

00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:45.280
 really enjoyed the movie so we 

00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:46.600
 advise you to go and see and 

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:48.760
 enjoy this picture 

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:51.880
 also don't forget that as usual 

00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:55.030
 marvel movies after titles goes 

00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:57.970
 secret scene where there will be a direct reference 

00:06:55.030 --> 00:07:01.630
 to the next movie about the apocalypse i 

00:06:57.970 --> 00:07:04.570
 noticed that many did not understand what 

00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:07.180
 means the secret scene and since we 

00:07:04.570 --> 00:07:08.740
 we know that most likely the next movie 

00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:11.290
 will be based on comics under 

00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:13.720
 the name of the age of the apocalypse as for this 

00:07:11.290 --> 00:07:16.210
 that kindly already mounted video 

00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:18.670
 where he talks about this comic if 

00:07:16.210 --> 00:07:22.570
 you will be interested in the link now 

00:07:18.670 --> 00:07:24.370
 screen and will be in the description also see 

00:07:22.570 --> 00:07:26.680
 review of the eponymous comics on which 

00:07:24.370 --> 00:07:28.870
 The basis of this painting is the days 

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:30.550
 the past of the future but if you forgot 

00:07:28.870 --> 00:07:33.040
 events of the previous parts 

00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:35.140
 then you can see a brief overview of them 

00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:38.290
 events that occurred earlier on 

00:07:35.140 --> 00:07:40.000
 Like this place all subscribe to 

00:07:38.290 --> 00:07:42.430

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:44.650

 is happy
