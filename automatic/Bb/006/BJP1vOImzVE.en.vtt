move<00:02:01.680> up<00:02:01.829> the<00:02:01.950> plant<00:02:02.189> in<00:02:02.399> search<00:02:02.640> of<00:02:02.670> light<00:02:03.000> and

move up the plant in search of light and

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.270 
move up the plant in search of light and
the<00:02:03.360> trichomes<00:02:03.780> accumulate<00:02:04.560> at<00:02:04.710> the<00:02:04.740> leaf<00:02:04.979> tip

in<00:02:06.180> this<00:02:06.390> photo<00:02:06.689> we<00:02:07.020> see<00:02:07.229> that<00:02:07.380> the<00:02:07.530> trichomes

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
in this photo we see that the trichomes

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.740

take<00:02:50.470> this<00:02:50.650> leaf<00:02:50.919> in<00:02:51.129> take<00:02:51.430> a<00:02:51.459> look<00:02:51.549> at<00:02:51.790> it

00:02:51.899 --> 00:02:51.909 
take this leaf in take a look at it

00:02:51.909 --> 00:02:54.300 
take this leaf in take a look at it
under<00:02:52.000> the<00:02:52.120> compounds<00:02:52.750> go<00:02:53.159> here<00:02:54.159> the

under the compounds go here the

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:55.800 
under the compounds go here the

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:57.370 
upper right hand corner and there's a

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:59.520 
upper right hand corner and there's a
try<00:02:57.579> cone<00:02:57.790> moving<00:02:58.180> along<00:02:58.629> the<00:02:58.900> surface<00:02:59.109> of<00:02:59.379> the

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:01.890 
try cone moving along the surface of the
slide<00:02:59.799> let<00:03:00.609> me<00:03:00.730> speed<00:03:01.120> up<00:03:01.150> the<00:03:01.389> motion<00:03:01.569> so<00:03:01.870> that

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:01.900 
slide let me speed up the motion so that

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:03.509 
slide let me speed up the motion so that
you<00:03:02.049> can<00:03:02.169> see<00:03:02.379> the<00:03:02.500> strike<00:03:02.769> thumb<00:03:02.980> moving<00:03:03.489> a

00:03:03.509 --> 00:03:03.519 
you can see the strike thumb moving a

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:06.449 
you can see the strike thumb moving a
little<00:03:03.700> bit<00:03:03.790> more<00:03:03.909> rapidly<00:03:05.040> now<00:03:06.040> after<00:03:06.340> this

00:03:06.449 --> 00:03:06.459 
little bit more rapidly now after this

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:08.550 
little bit more rapidly now after this
trichome<00:03:06.969> gets<00:03:07.419> out<00:03:07.599> of<00:03:07.629> the<00:03:07.900> view<00:03:08.439> we're

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:08.560 
trichome gets out of the view we're

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:09.690 
trichome gets out of the view we're
gonna<00:03:08.650> have<00:03:08.829> another<00:03:09.010> one<00:03:09.189> running<00:03:09.310> across

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:09.700 
gonna have another one running across

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:12.720 
gonna have another one running across
diagonally<00:03:10.030> across<00:03:10.900> the<00:03:11.680> screen<00:03:12.069> here<00:03:12.609> you

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:12.730 
diagonally across the screen here you

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:15.240 
diagonally across the screen here you
can<00:03:12.879> see<00:03:13.060> it<00:03:13.150> moving<00:03:13.359> along<00:03:13.540> and<00:03:14.099> it's<00:03:15.099> a

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:15.250 
can see it moving along and it's a

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:16.559 
can see it moving along and it's a
pretty<00:03:15.459> long<00:03:15.669> one<00:03:15.879> so<00:03:15.909> it<00:03:16.090> takes<00:03:16.239> a<00:03:16.329> minute<00:03:16.540> for

00:03:16.559 --> 00:03:16.569 
pretty long one so it takes a minute for

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:19.229 
pretty long one so it takes a minute for
it<00:03:16.780> to<00:03:16.840> get<00:03:16.989> entirely<00:03:17.560> across<00:03:18.340> the<00:03:18.729> field<00:03:19.090> of

00:03:19.229 --> 00:03:19.239 
it to get entirely across the field of

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:23.710 
it to get entirely across the field of
view

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:23.720 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:26.570 

there<00:03:24.720> it<00:03:24.840> goes<00:03:25.020> then<00:03:25.980> here's<00:03:26.160> a<00:03:26.220> couple<00:03:26.430> of

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:26.580 
there it goes then here's a couple of

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:28.550 
there it goes then here's a couple of
trichomes<00:03:26.970> moving<00:03:27.330> at<00:03:27.450> normal<00:03:27.750> speed<00:03:28.230> I'm

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560 
trichomes moving at normal speed I'm

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.500 
trichomes moving at normal speed I'm
gonna<00:03:28.710> speed<00:03:28.980> it<00:03:29.010> up<00:03:29.220> in<00:03:29.340> a<00:03:29.400> second<00:03:29.790> and<00:03:29.910> we're

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510 
gonna speed it up in a second and we're

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:32.440 
gonna speed it up in a second and we're
gonna<00:03:30.600> watch<00:03:30.840> these<00:03:31.080> two<00:03:31.290> pass<00:03:31.530> each<00:03:31.770> other

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:32.450 
gonna watch these two pass each other

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:35.270 
gonna watch these two pass each other
going<00:03:33.450> in<00:03:33.570> opposite<00:03:34.020> directions<00:03:34.080> and<00:03:34.680> if<00:03:35.160> you

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280 
going in opposite directions and if you

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:36.860 
going in opposite directions and if you
watch<00:03:35.490> the<00:03:35.640> trichome<00:03:36.060> on<00:03:36.240> the<00:03:36.360> right<00:03:36.570> you'll

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870 
watch the trichome on the right you'll

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:38.750 
watch the trichome on the right you'll
see<00:03:36.900> an<00:03:37.230> area<00:03:37.530> where<00:03:37.740> it's<00:03:37.950> about<00:03:38.220> to<00:03:38.460> divide

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760 
see an area where it's about to divide

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:40.220 
see an area where it's about to divide
which<00:03:39.060> is<00:03:39.180> where<00:03:39.330> it<00:03:39.420> separates<00:03:39.810> just<00:03:39.990> coming

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:40.230 
which is where it separates just coming

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:42.110 
which is where it separates just coming
on<00:03:40.320> the<00:03:40.470> screen<00:03:40.560> now<00:03:40.920> and<00:03:41.100> then<00:03:41.820> we'll<00:03:41.970> also

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:42.120 
on the screen now and then we'll also

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:43.670
