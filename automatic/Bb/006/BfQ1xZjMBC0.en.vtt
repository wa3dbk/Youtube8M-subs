00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:34.250 
the modified German pace I see it so

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:37.300 
the modified German pace I see it so
here<00:03:34.430> it<00:03:34.459> again<00:03:35.139> come<00:03:36.139> down<00:03:36.170> come<00:03:36.889> down<00:03:36.950> one

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:37.310 
here it again come down come down one

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:41.309 
here it again come down come down one
more<00:03:37.810> this<00:03:38.810> is<00:03:38.959> your<00:03:39.109> color<00:03:39.349> selection<00:03:40.010> green

00:03:41.309 --> 00:03:41.319

more this is your color selection green
white<00:03:42.319> red<00:03:42.760> I<00:03:43.760> like<00:03:44.389> the<00:03:44.540> green<00:03:44.750> so<00:03:45.049> hey<00:03:45.200> it

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:45.260 
white red I like the green so hey it

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.470 
white red I like the green so hey it
again<00:03:45.470> to<00:03:45.620> save<00:03:45.859> it<00:03:46.069> the<00:03:46.639> last<00:03:46.879> one<00:03:47.180> is<00:03:47.329> your

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:47.480 
again to save it the last one is your

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:49.240 
again to save it the last one is your
elevation<00:03:48.109> and<00:03:48.290> windage<00:03:48.560> adjustment<00:03:49.160> go

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:49.250 
elevation and windage adjustment go

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:52.990 
elevation and windage adjustment go
ahead<00:03:49.370> here<00:03:49.609> at<00:03:49.699> once<00:03:49.940> and<00:03:51.370> it<00:03:52.370> switches<00:03:52.609> the

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:53.000 
ahead here at once and it switches the

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.300 
ahead here at once and it switches the
radical<00:03:53.449> pattern<00:03:53.810> but<00:03:53.959> don't<00:03:54.319> worry<00:03:54.560> there's

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:55.310 
radical pattern but don't worry there's

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:59.500 
radical pattern but don't worry there's
your<00:03:55.519> X<00:03:56.139> for<00:03:57.139> your<00:03:57.290> windage<00:03:57.769> and<00:03:58.069> your<00:03:58.849> Y<00:03:59.120> what

00:03:59.500 --> 00:03:59.510 
your X for your windage and your Y what

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:03.729 
your X for your windage and your Y what
I<00:03:59.720> discovered<00:04:00.579> which<00:04:01.579> is<00:04:01.849> very<00:04:02.810> interesting

00:04:03.729 --> 00:04:03.739 
I discovered which is very interesting

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:06.039 
I discovered which is very interesting
to<00:04:03.859> many<00:04:04.099> when<00:04:04.970> i<00:04:05.000> first<00:04:05.329> sighted<00:04:05.720> in<00:04:05.870> this

00:04:06.039 --> 00:04:06.049 
to many when i first sighted in this

00:04:06.049 --> 00:04:08.530 
to many when i first sighted in this
rifle<00:04:06.319> I<00:04:06.650> was<00:04:06.859> hitting<00:04:07.329> approximately<00:04:08.329> 8

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:08.540 
rifle I was hitting approximately 8

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:12.430 
rifle I was hitting approximately 8
inches<00:04:08.930> low<00:04:09.260> and<00:04:10.150> so<00:04:11.150> what<00:04:11.359> I<00:04:11.389> discovered<00:04:12.290> is

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:12.440 
inches low and so what I discovered is

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:14.800 
inches low and so what I discovered is
to<00:04:12.980> raise<00:04:13.220> the<00:04:13.400> point<00:04:13.609> of<00:04:13.819> impact<00:04:14.000> it's<00:04:14.599> kind

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:14.810 
to raise the point of impact it's kind

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:16.330 
to raise the point of impact it's kind
of<00:04:14.870> counterintuitive<00:04:15.229> but<00:04:15.799> just<00:04:16.010> keep<00:04:16.159> this

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:16.340 
of counterintuitive but just keep this

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:19.270 
of counterintuitive but just keep this
in<00:04:16.519> mind<00:04:16.729> remember<00:04:17.359> this<00:04:17.780> on<00:04:17.989> the<00:04:18.109> video<00:04:18.280> what

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:19.280 
in mind remember this on the video what

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:22.659 
in mind remember this on the video what
you<00:04:19.459> want<00:04:19.669> to<00:04:19.849> do<00:04:20.030> is<00:04:20.829> if<00:04:21.829> you're<00:04:22.130> hitting<00:04:22.490> a

00:04:22.659 --> 00:04:22.669 
you want to do is if you're hitting a

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:25.149 
you want to do is if you're hitting a
row<00:04:22.849> you<00:04:23.750> want<00:04:23.870> to<00:04:23.990> give<00:04:24.169> negative<00:04:24.470> numbers

00:04:25.149 --> 00:04:25.159 
row you want to give negative numbers

00:04:25.159 --> 00:04:31.089 
row you want to give negative numbers
okay<00:04:25.849> so<00:04:26.229> see<00:04:27.229> as<00:04:27.380> I<00:04:27.530> rotate<00:04:27.979> this<00:04:30.099> it

00:04:31.089 --> 00:04:31.099 
okay so see as I rotate this it

00:04:31.099 --> 00:04:33.939 
okay so see as I rotate this it
increments<00:04:31.880> or<00:04:32.000> decrements<00:04:32.199> so<00:04:33.199> to<00:04:33.260> raise<00:04:33.770> the

00:04:33.939 --> 00:04:33.949 
increments or decrements so to raise the

00:04:33.949 --> 00:04:36.360 
increments or decrements so to raise the
point<00:04:34.130> of<00:04:34.310> impact<00:04:34.460> you<00:04:34.909> want<00:04:35.030> to<00:04:35.150> be<00:04:35.300> negative

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:36.370 
point of impact you want to be negative

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:39.040 
point of impact you want to be negative
to<00:04:37.370> lower<00:04:37.610> the<00:04:37.909> point<00:04:38.180> of<00:04:38.270> impact<00:04:38.570> you<00:04:38.810> want<00:04:38.960> to

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:39.050 
to lower the point of impact you want to

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:41.170 
to lower the point of impact you want to
go<00:04:39.139> positive<00:04:39.770> so<00:04:40.280> once<00:04:40.490> you're<00:04:40.639> satisfied<00:04:40.820> if

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:41.180 
go positive so once you're satisfied if

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:44.670 
go positive so once you're satisfied if
that<00:04:41.360> said<00:04:41.599> it<00:04:41.720> hit<00:04:41.900> the<00:04:42.020> button<00:04:42.760> hold<00:04:43.760> it<00:04:43.880> in

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:44.680 
that said it hit the button hold it in

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:49.060 
that said it hit the button hold it in
hold<00:04:45.680> it<00:04:45.830> in<00:04:45.949> again<00:04:46.310> and<00:04:46.580> you're<00:04:47.479> back<00:04:47.949> so<00:04:48.949> it's

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:49.070 
hold it in again and you're back so it's

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:50.980 
hold it in again and you're back so it's
fairly<00:04:49.310> separate<00:04:49.880> fairly<00:04:50.330> easy<00:04:50.479> to<00:04:50.659> set<00:04:50.960> up
