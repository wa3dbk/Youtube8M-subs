00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.259
 hello i have my hair care today 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:07.379
 routine for you a few of you 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:09.360
 had requested that so I say today 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:12.690
 it is not that special here 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:15.750
 but yes, first to my hair that are 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:20.210
 not really smooth though 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:23.820
 completely flat but already relatively smooth 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:26.250
 I got pretty dry tips through 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.260
 my tip 3 what you already mean 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:32.309
 can not call open because it is 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:34.410
 is just as blatant and yes I have 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:37.620
 pretty soon after greasy hair 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:41.010
 so different and what else can I do 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.660
 say I have rather thin hair though 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.160
 of it very much 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.820
 So I do not have thick hair but 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:51.210
 but then quite a lot of hair like that 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:53.250
 and that is pretty stupid but I have 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.379
 they just smoothed out so that's how they look 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.899
 not in the normal state from because I 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:01.320
 nice but yes they are me 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:03.059
 make ghetto once every two years 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.619
 the philippines as they did not have that 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:08.220
 there I am doing I let my duration 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:10.740
 make evaluation that's just such a 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.510
 Laston, yes, that if I know it 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.950
 is google that please because if i do that 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:17.070
 now explained the video is too long 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:19.700
 so I start with my shampoo 1 1 what 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:22.920
 I actually what I am about my family 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:25.770
 always use englich is head and 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.119
 shoulders the classic klien but there is 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.420
 It does not matter which one but simply 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:32.400
 only this anti dandruff because yes 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:35.750
 I pretty much have problems here 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:39.950
 my scalp this this pretty much 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:43.259
 sensitive and tends to shed very much 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:45.810
 and that's why I use it this way 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:48.720
 good as always i can have everyone but 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:50.939
 almost always because otherwise it's one 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:53.340
 Disaster is and the ingredients 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:55.320
 it is not good but it is 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.719
 just helps it calms my scalp so 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:00.210
 a bit and just the shed 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:04.229
 then yes , I have to valea pure 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:05.820
 volume shampoo this is this because 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:07.979
 I just take my hair 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.539
 have a little more volume so are the 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:12.040
 simply not so complete 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:15.610
 flat but a bit volume 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:18.879
 that's just fine, and that's relatively good 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:21.150
 and yes I like that too so I use it 

00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:24.040
 so have been for a few months now 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:25.719
 and pretty much likes it 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:27.909
 Deep clean once a week 

00:02:25.719 --> 00:02:31.599
 shampoo at the moment i use that from 

00:02:27.909 --> 00:02:34.780
 google this sample live liberates mild 

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:36.099
 from gabler and yes i had a time 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:38.889
 long as of valea this 

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:40.840
 deep cleansing shampoo the blue and yes 

00:02:38.889 --> 00:02:44.129
 I always like that more than this 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:47.170
 yes, at the moment I have this here and 

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:50.290
 That's just how it is for deep cleansing 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:52.150
 shampoos and yes something is just happy 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:54.519
 sometimes even once a week 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:55.989
 twice but actually once more 

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:58.150
 It also needs everyone 

00:02:55.989 --> 00:03:00.299
 Hair wash a reflection at the moment 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:03.790
 I have that of garnier's 

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:06.700
 olives the olive oil and lemon 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:09.189
 I'm not that picky so 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:11.500
 because it does not really matter which one 

00:03:09.189 --> 00:03:16.090
 i just got the iss for dry 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:19.540
 and lackluster h so what purging is concerned 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:21.040
 That's not that important 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:23.199
 which is that I am trying 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:24.790
 really like to go out and watch 

00:03:23.199 --> 00:03:26.349
 just if she is good or not and 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:28.139
 I really like that at the moment 

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:31.959
 actually directly quite well and 

00:03:28.139 --> 00:03:33.940
 makes the hair very soft and then 

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:36.459
 will become one once a week 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:38.349
 This is just the only one that is allowed 

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:41.379
 moisturizing it with this 

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:44.349
 golden rings that's second too 

00:03:41.379 --> 00:03:47.680
 or third pack so i love me 

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:49.419
 pretty much so, yes I always 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:53.769
 buy again because they are just fine 

00:03:49.419 --> 00:03:56.560
 is and even my totally broken 

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:58.780
 tips again makes soft and beautiful and 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:00.549
 the shining ones too, and yes, yes 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:04.180
 when I hear the user to 

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:05.769
 afterwards the flush always because yes the 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:07.419
 Rinse should then the hair again so 

00:04:05.769 --> 00:04:10.930
 somehow I shut up 

00:04:07.419 --> 00:04:12.639
 So yes I use it that way and once in 

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:14.680
 I also use the week here 

00:04:12.639 --> 00:04:18.370
 not even once in the distance 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:21.579
 week so from time to time the oil of will 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:23.870
 the almond oil this i like this 

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:26.300
 not so much of the effect 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:28.040
 It is super good but from the order 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:31.610
 it's rather difficult because it's pretty 

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:33.889
 So it looks like you can do it quickly 

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:37.790
 sometimes even a point off 

00:04:33.889 --> 00:04:39.320
 so it is rather stupid but of 

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:42.500
 of the week there's been nothing of the 

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:43.880
 effect it is quite good but yes if it is 

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:46.190
 I'll use that up on everyone 

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:48.050
 buy another case because this one 

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:49.699
 is just too stupid then always 

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:51.410
 to take care and that just just 

00:04:49.699 --> 00:04:53.440
 to apply in the evening when I am closest 

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:56.030
 day so my hair but already 

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:58.370
 but even if i am doing that very well and im 

00:04:56.030 --> 00:05:00.229
 moment I use that and just like it 

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:02.750
 actually quite happy to just 

00:05:00.229 --> 00:05:04.669
 the order then always after the laundry 

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:06.320
 and use before blow-drying or smoothing 

00:05:04.669 --> 00:05:08.590
 I have a heat protection I have in 

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:11.949
 moment an age of dougherty 

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:15.800
 heat protection blablabla this red here 

00:05:11.949 --> 00:05:18.020
 yes with heat protection, I see somehow 

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:20.260
 never really different if you do 

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:23.120
 no one used and just one and there 

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:26.330
 I do not usually know, I forget 

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:32.300
 them just so I'm so 

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:35.690
 not so much no idea because 

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:37.070
 Somehow, when I see nothing I am there 

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:38.539
 somehow no difference when I enter 

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:41.090
 if i am not a user though 

00:05:38.539 --> 00:05:41.960
 We look after when the teacher is the one 

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:43.669
 is also empty soon 

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:44.960
 Which definitely buy others 

00:05:43.669 --> 00:05:48.320
 because I do not know if he still is 

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:52.610
 there is no in the assortment 

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:55.340
 Idea is happy from time to time and 

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:57.289
 then I know every now and then but so each 

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:59.570
 second time when I'm using my hair 

00:05:57.289 --> 00:06:03.250
 if I smoothen and I think so 

00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:05.389
 not at all and yes I do not know last 

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:06.620
 I just can not do that much anyway 

00:06:05.389 --> 00:06:08.990
 I can not say that much 

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:11.510
 because I see no difference there 

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:13.190
 then it will be after the shower too 

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:16.250
 always a trace 

00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:19.220
 that's the one of may already came like 

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:22.340
 the cure in several favorite videos before 

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:25.039
 That's the return of the care exactly 

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:27.199
 how the spa just sprayed 

00:06:25.039 --> 00:06:29.120
 This can also be done in dry hair 

00:06:27.199 --> 00:06:31.130
 but I do that too 

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:32.900
 but sometimes always like that 

00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:34.560
 the hair wash is actually already 

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:37.710
 a bit empty but 

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:39.360
 yes, in contrast to the heat protection itself 

00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:42.300
 this much difference fell 

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:44.880
 and I really like that because that's it 

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:47.220
 just when I have the cure so the cure in 

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:48.600
 I used the shower and the shower 

00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:50.580
 then flush user then if I can 

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:52.950
 also used it somehow then 

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:55.440
 but almost as if I was like that 

00:06:52.950 --> 00:06:56.070
 Just used and was able to relatively 

00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:58.680
 a lot of 

00:06:56.070 --> 00:07:02.280
 and yes that is pretty good for that 

00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:04.200
 hair that you can also in the approach 

00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:06.000
 you want to spray but I have one 

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:08.430
 a little bit afraid because then I always 

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:10.139
 I'm afraid that looks just finished 

00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:13.380
 and that is not quite the case 

00:07:10.139 --> 00:07:17.910
 nice so yes that makes the hair too 

00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:22.440
 very rich and ruth kemper and i like 

00:07:17.910 --> 00:07:23.940
 The whole likes that so that's it 

00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:26.160
 it was actually the products the 

00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:27.050
 I do not even use that 

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:30.630
 so much 

00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:32.490
 So I do not know you still have 

00:07:30.630 --> 00:07:33.870
 I have more questions or something 

00:07:32.490 --> 00:07:35.190
 now something did not answer 

00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:37.889
 I forgot something I hope not 

00:07:35.190 --> 00:07:39.330
 and yes that was it with the video me 

00:07:37.889 --> 00:07:41.760
 Hope you liked it and somehow 

00:07:39.330 --> 00:07:43.229
 helped or no idea and 

00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:46.490
 then we'll see it next time 

00:07:43.229 --> 00:07:46.490
 then again bye bit
