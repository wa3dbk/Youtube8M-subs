were<00:01:09.119> absolute<00:01:09.869> howlers<00:01:10.770> i<00:01:11.010> have<00:01:11.220> to<00:01:11.369> say<00:01:11.580> but

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
were absolute howlers i have to say but

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.359 
were absolute howlers i have to say but
I'm<00:01:12.390> getting<00:01:12.750> there<00:01:12.780> gradually<00:01:13.229> and<00:01:13.619> there

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
I'm getting there gradually and there

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:15.830 
I'm getting there gradually and there
should<00:01:14.549> be<00:01:14.640> some<00:01:14.820> very<00:01:15.000> exciting<00:01:15.240> new<00:01:15.540> attacks

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
should be some very exciting new attacks

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.320 
should be some very exciting new attacks
for<00:01:16.080> you<00:01:16.229> soon<00:01:16.500> but<00:01:17.100> I<00:01:17.130> was<00:01:17.490> in<00:01:17.520> the<00:01:17.850> process<00:01:18.030> of

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
for you soon but I was in the process of

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.399 
for you soon but I was in the process of
doing<00:01:19.140> a<00:01:19.530> multi<00:01:19.890> inferno<00:01:20.460> how<00:01:20.759> to<00:01:20.820> beat<00:01:21.540> video

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
doing a multi inferno how to beat video

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:26.240 
doing a multi inferno how to beat video
so<00:01:23.220> I<00:01:23.250> guess<00:01:23.580> we<00:01:23.880> should<00:01:24.090> go<00:01:24.420> through<00:01:24.450> it<00:01:24.950> so<00:01:25.950> up

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
so I guess we should go through it so up

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.130 
so I guess we should go through it so up
first<00:01:26.640> before<00:01:26.939> we<00:01:27.360> see<00:01:27.570> the<00:01:27.810> most<00:01:28.020> beautiful

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
first before we see the most beautiful

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.340 
first before we see the most beautiful
thing<00:01:28.890> in<00:01:28.920> clash<00:01:29.280> of<00:01:29.460> clans<00:01:29.759> to<00:01:30.600> multi

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
thing in clash of clans to multi

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:47.820 
thing in clash of clans to multi
infernos<00:01:32.009> barge

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:47.830 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:51.190 

so<00:01:48.830> I<00:01:48.860> picked<00:01:49.190> this<00:01:49.280> village<00:01:49.670> to<00:01:50.540> show<00:01:50.750> you<00:01:50.810> how

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:51.200 
so I picked this village to show you how

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.500 
so I picked this village to show you how
to<00:01:51.260> beat<00:01:51.800> multi<00:01:52.310> infernos<00:01:52.820> with<00:01:53.060> botches

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:53.510 
to beat multi infernos with botches

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:55.900 
to beat multi infernos with botches
because<00:01:54.470> the<00:01:54.710> to<00:01:54.980> inferno<00:01:55.280> is<00:01:55.550> our<00:01:55.670> SAT<00:01:55.880> a

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:55.910 
because the to inferno is our SAT a

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:57.730 
because the to inferno is our SAT a
little<00:01:56.330> way<00:01:56.450> back<00:01:56.660> from<00:01:56.840> the<00:01:56.960> town<00:01:57.170> hall<00:01:57.380> which

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:57.740 
little way back from the town hall which

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:00.040 
little way back from the town hall which
gives<00:01:58.070> us<00:01:58.310> the<00:01:58.580> chance<00:01:58.610> to<00:01:59.600> get<00:01:59.840> up<00:01:59.870> close

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:00.050 
gives us the chance to get up close

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:02.920 
gives us the chance to get up close
before<00:02:00.950> they<00:02:01.310> start<00:02:01.610> frying<00:02:02.150> all<00:02:02.660> of<00:02:02.810> our

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:02.930 
before they start frying all of our

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:06.010 
before they start frying all of our
troops<00:02:03.260> and<00:02:03.970> so<00:02:04.970> the<00:02:05.120> plan<00:02:05.360> here<00:02:05.660> is<00:02:05.690> going<00:02:05.930> to

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:06.020 
troops and so the plan here is going to

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:08.109 
troops and so the plan here is going to
be<00:02:06.200> stick<00:02:06.500> a<00:02:06.530> golem<00:02:06.860> to<00:02:06.890> the<00:02:07.010> wall<00:02:07.280> to<00:02:07.730> distract

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:03.650 
this so this was a few days ago so i

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:05.440

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:08.120 
which is very different to now and they

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:10.420

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:17.890 
first inferno you wouldn't be able to do
that<00:03:16.640> if<00:03:16.820> it<00:03:16.910> was<00:03:17.030> just<00:03:17.060> archers<00:03:17.630> but<00:03:17.810> the

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:17.900 
that if it was just archers but the

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:19.330 
that if it was just archers but the
arches<00:03:18.170> and<00:03:18.290> the<00:03:18.350> Queen<00:03:18.560> are<00:03:18.739> straight<00:03:19.100> on<00:03:19.250> the

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:21.860 
town hall and it's straight down so I

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:23.680 
town hall and it's straight down so I
remember<00:03:22.190> doing<00:03:22.310> this<00:03:22.430> attack<00:03:22.850> and<00:03:23.150> I<00:03:23.360> thought

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:23.690 
remember doing this attack and I thought

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:25.960 
remember doing this attack and I thought
okay<00:03:24.170> I<00:03:24.440> have<00:03:24.860> used<00:03:25.100> the<00:03:25.280> Queen's<00:03:25.489> ability<00:03:25.940> a

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:25.970 
okay I have used the Queen's ability a

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:27.940 
okay I have used the Queen's ability a
little<00:03:26.300> bit<00:03:26.450> too<00:03:26.630> early<00:03:26.690> there<00:03:27.140> but<00:03:27.350> I<00:03:27.739> was

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:27.950 
little bit too early there but I was

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:29.620 
little bit too early there but I was
determined<00:03:28.130> to<00:03:28.910> get<00:03:29.120> her<00:03:29.360> through<00:03:29.390> this

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:29.630 
determined to get her through this

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:31.990 
determined to get her through this
battle<00:03:29.930> without<00:03:30.140> losing<00:03:30.799> any<00:03:30.950> of<00:03:31.130> her<00:03:31.370> health

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:32.000 
battle without losing any of her health

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.199 
battle without losing any of her health
and<00:03:32.239> I<00:03:33.170> think<00:03:33.440> I<00:03:33.560> did<00:03:33.799> just<00:03:33.830> about<00:03:34.400> make<00:03:34.790> it<00:03:35.030> so

00:03:35.199 --> 00:03:35.209 
and I think I did just about make it so

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:38.289 
and I think I did just about make it so
I<00:03:35.239> quit<00:03:35.570> quickly<00:03:35.989> and<00:03:36.730> took<00:03:37.730> the<00:03:37.850> Queen<00:03:38.060> home

I quit quickly and took the Queen home
in<00:03:38.600> full<00:03:39.500> health<00:03:40.070> so<00:03:41.500> this<00:03:42.500> was<00:03:42.680> another

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:10.530 
in clash of clans attacking so on this

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:12.410 
in clash of clans attacking so on this
particular<00:04:10.680> base<00:04:11.190> i'm<00:04:11.519> thinking<00:04:11.970> right<00:04:12.209> now

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:12.420 
particular base i'm thinking right now

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:14.990 
particular base i'm thinking right now
and<00:04:12.870> this<00:04:12.989> is<00:04:13.050> why<00:04:13.290> I'm<00:04:13.470> pausing<00:04:14.010> for<00:04:14.040> so<00:04:14.489> long

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:15.000 
and this is why I'm pausing for so long

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.150 
and this is why I'm pausing for so long
is<00:04:15.390> because<00:04:15.450> i<00:04:15.900> don't<00:04:16.229> know<00:04:16.320> if<00:04:16.709> i<00:04:16.829> want<00:04:17.070> to

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:17.160 
is because i don't know if i want to

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:19.039 
is because i don't know if i want to
send<00:04:17.489> that<00:04:17.760> golem<00:04:18.299> straight<00:04:18.720> down<00:04:18.840> the<00:04:19.019> middle

send that golem straight down the middle

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:21.770 
send that golem straight down the middle
if<00:04:19.410> i<00:04:19.530> do<00:04:19.850> almost<00:04:20.850> certainly<00:04:21.359> the<00:04:21.419> queen<00:04:21.750> is

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:21.780 
if i do almost certainly the queen is

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:24.170 
if i do almost certainly the queen is
