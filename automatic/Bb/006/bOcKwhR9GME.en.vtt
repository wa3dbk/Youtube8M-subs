all great great young men and you know

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:33.350 
all great great young men and you know
they're<00:01:32.369> going<00:01:32.490> to<00:01:32.549> have<00:01:32.700> their<00:01:32.850> degrees<00:01:33.180> the

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
they're going to have their degrees the

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:34.880 
they're going to have their degrees the
guys<00:01:33.540> you<00:01:33.720> mentioned<00:01:33.750> all<00:01:34.229> have<00:01:34.409> their<00:01:34.590> degree

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
guys you mentioned all have their degree

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.289 
guys you mentioned all have their degree
so<00:01:35.130> they're<00:01:35.280> going<00:01:35.430> to<00:01:35.490> be<00:01:35.640> said<00:01:35.880> either<00:01:36.030> way

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
so they're going to be said either way

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:45.499 
so they're going to be said either way
so<00:01:36.360> it's<00:01:36.780> a<00:01:36.930> win-win<00:01:37.170> for<00:01:37.409> them<00:01:44.390> you<00:01:45.390> know

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
so it's a win-win for them you know

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.120 
so it's a win-win for them you know
actually<00:01:45.630> I<00:01:45.869> think<00:01:45.930> it's<00:01:46.200> fairly<00:01:46.470> similar<00:01:46.979> to

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
actually I think it's fairly similar to

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.480 
actually I think it's fairly similar to
what<00:01:47.310> we<00:01:47.430> had<00:01:47.460> a<00:01:47.640> couple<00:01:47.909> of<00:01:48.090> years<00:01:48.210> ago<00:01:48.329> when

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:49.490 
what we had a couple of years ago when

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:52.280 
what we had a couple of years ago when
Demaryius<00:01:50.490> and<00:01:50.850> Derek<00:01:51.600> Morgan<00:01:51.780> were<00:01:51.960> coming

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
Demaryius and Derek Morgan were coming

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.980 
Demaryius and Derek Morgan were coming
out<00:01:53.180> you<00:01:54.180> know<00:01:54.270> I<00:01:54.299> don't<00:01:54.509> know<00:01:54.630> the<00:01:54.780> total

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
out you know I don't know the total

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.319 
out you know I don't know the total
number<00:01:55.320> of<00:01:55.380> people<00:01:55.710> here<00:01:55.860> today<00:01:56.009> but<00:01:56.329> we've

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
number of people here today but we've

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:58.730 
number of people here today but we've
been<00:01:57.360> fortunate<00:01:57.750> I<00:01:57.960> think<00:01:58.200> we're<00:01:58.350> in<00:01:58.380> a<00:01:58.439> place

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
been fortunate I think we're in a place

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.819 
been fortunate I think we're in a place
that's<00:01:59.009> easy<00:01:59.969> to<00:02:00.180> get<00:02:00.329> to<00:02:00.540> and<00:02:00.570> when<00:02:01.530> you<00:02:01.619> have

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
that's easy to get to and when you have

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:04.160 
that's easy to get to and when you have
you<00:02:02.790> know<00:02:02.909> some<00:02:03.090> talented<00:02:03.479> kids<00:02:03.719> they<00:02:03.869> tend<00:02:04.140> to

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
you know some talented kids they tend to

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.560 
you know some talented kids they tend to
show<00:02:04.380> up<00:02:04.619> so<00:02:04.649> I<00:02:05.369> think<00:02:05.640> what<00:02:05.939> Stephen<00:02:06.329> did<00:02:06.360> it

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
show up so I think what Stephen did it

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.419 
show up so I think what Stephen did it
to<00:02:06.689> combine<00:02:07.079> certainly<00:02:07.619> turn<00:02:07.890> a<00:02:07.920> lot<00:02:08.099> of<00:02:08.250> heads

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
to combine certainly turn a lot of heads

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:12.379 
to combine certainly turn a lot of heads
and<00:02:08.700> so<00:02:09.390> we<00:02:09.509> have<00:02:09.629> a<00:02:09.660> lot<00:02:09.840> of<00:02:09.869> people<00:02:10.080> here
