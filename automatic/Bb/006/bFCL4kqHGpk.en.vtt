00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:23.750 
when I was at Duke and think about game

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:25.029 
when I was at Duke and think about game
theory<00:00:23.990> that<00:00:24.170> it's<00:00:24.349> really<00:00:24.560> interesting<00:00:24.800> to

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:25.039 
theory that it's really interesting to

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:26.620 
theory that it's really interesting to
study<00:00:25.279> but<00:00:25.910> it<00:00:25.970> doesn't<00:00:26.210> make<00:00:26.300> you<00:00:26.420> a<00:00:26.449> whole

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:26.630 
study but it doesn't make you a whole

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:28.060 
study but it doesn't make you a whole
hell<00:00:26.810> of<00:00:26.840> a<00:00:26.990> lot<00:00:27.019> of<00:00:27.230> money<00:00:27.260> I<00:00:27.619> started<00:00:27.980> to

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:28.070 
hell of a lot of money I started to

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:29.679 
hell of a lot of money I started to
think<00:00:28.130> about<00:00:28.369> ways<00:00:28.640> that<00:00:28.699> I<00:00:29.029> could<00:00:29.179> apply<00:00:29.449> what

00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:29.689 
think about ways that I could apply what

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:30.920 
I was learning towards trying to make

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:31.990

00:03:30.879 --> 00:03:30.889 
a very specific reason for me doing so I

00:03:30.889 --> 00:03:34.449 
a very specific reason for me doing so I

the poker tournament I'm always
consciously<00:03:52.819> telling<00:03:53.540> myself<00:03:53.690> the<00:03:54.169> style<00:03:54.470> of

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:54.620 
consciously telling myself the style of

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:56.649 
consciously telling myself the style of

00:03:56.649 --> 00:03:56.659 
play that I want to emulate but you know

00:03:56.659 --> 00:03:58.119 
play that I want to emulate but you know
a<00:03:56.689> last<00:03:57.049> missive<00:03:57.379> okay<00:03:57.590> it<00:03:57.650> seems<00:03:57.799> like<00:03:58.010> my

00:03:58.119 --> 00:03:58.129 
a last missive okay it seems like my

00:03:58.129 --> 00:03:59.679 
a last missive okay it seems like my
opponents<00:03:58.489> now<00:03:58.579> are<00:03:58.729> loosening<00:03:59.060> up<00:03:59.209> how

00:03:59.679 --> 00:03:59.689 
opponents now are loosening up how

00:03:59.689 --> 00:04:01.599

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:01.609 
should that affect my play these kinds

00:04:01.609 --> 00:04:02.890 
should that affect my play these kinds
of<00:04:01.639> things<00:04:01.699> are<00:04:01.970> going<00:04:02.269> to<00:04:02.449> think<00:04:02.479> about<00:04:02.810> at

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:02.900 
of things are going to think about at

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:04.629 
of things are going to think about at
the<00:04:02.989> table<00:04:03.319> so<00:04:03.560> I<00:04:03.769> would<00:04:04.159> like<00:04:04.310> to<00:04:04.340> think<00:04:04.549> of

00:04:04.629 --> 00:04:04.639 
the table so I would like to think of

00:04:04.639 --> 00:04:43.260 
the table so I would like to think of
myself<00:04:04.699> as<00:04:05.120> a<00:04:05.180> fluid<00:04:05.780> you<00:04:06.169> know<00:04:06.290> and
