00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.689
 that it is not easy to make a release 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:06.000
 of a cougar that's in touch with that state 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:08.700
 with people that's why it takes its 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.460
 time also know if that animal is 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:13.440
 adapted to be released because that 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.660
 it may happen that he is not used to 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.760
 live in a wild state if you have been 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.830
 in a domestic environment 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.050
 If I'm the instinct, it's not going to be lost 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.960
 they already know how to instinctively 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.730
 move what's going to catch him the problem is 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:30.000
 I do not know what is human then I do not know 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:32.610
 He is afraid and not afraid of him anymore 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.880
 likely an accident or 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.860
 to go down some field or pass someone 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:41.219
 walking and 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:44.610
 the animal for wanting to play or approach and 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:46.920
 it's not very funny let's say that it 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.289
 about a cougar for a person because 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.629
 obviously you will be scared and good and 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:54.180
 obviously one is going to defend itself or 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:56.129
 someone in the field or if he arrives for 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:59.180
 produce the death of an old woman or a 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:01.670
 cow a foal will kill him 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:03.590
 apart that there are no wild prey that 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:06.290
 they eat then obviously in some 

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:09.380
 moment will go down to a field and can 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:12.200
 get to give in the low of some sheep 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:14.390
 or some goat we deduce then that no 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:16.310
 it is advisable to have this type of 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:19.040
 animals in a situation of scope 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:22.130
 domestic for nothing any animal 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:24.110
 wild should be in a house 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:27.080
 the wild animal has to be in 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:29.600
 your place there is a phrase that says your house 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:31.910
 it's not your house and it's like that 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:34.220
 apart there is a law that protects them and 

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:36.500
 traffic for more than you are business 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:38.899
 that sell wild animals yes 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:40.430
 while there is demand will continue 

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:42.020
 having traffic then what 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:44.720
 we ask the people is that they do not 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:47.180
 buy them that there are dogs cats horses 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:49.430
 rabbits in my many animals 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:51.050
 you can have but this 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:53.720
 kind of animals not because apart from 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:55.520
 causes damage for the rest of your life 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:57.619
 because if this animal does not adapt it's going to 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:00.080
 be condemned to live in a cage or 

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:02.300
 in an enclosure that no matter how much 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:04.970
 big will never be like your freedom 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:06.170
 Well, these animals travel 50 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:09.140
 kilometers per night 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:12.590
 territory looking for prey are animals 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:14.150
 large and large predators and 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:16.160
 predators always need a lot 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:18.680
 territory and they are very conflictive because 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:20.330
 at the time of the fields it is always going to 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:23.470
 produce conflict with man because 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:23.470
 he needs to feed
