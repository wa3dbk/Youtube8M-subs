heard from the song on canvas so as a
few<00:00:08.880> different<00:00:09.030> things<00:00:09.240> that<00:00:09.510> I<00:00:09.570> decided<00:00:09.900> to

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.110 
few different things that I decided to

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.620 
few different things that I decided to
combine<00:00:10.290> in<00:00:11.280> this<00:00:11.490> particular<00:00:11.639> painting<00:00:12.330> that

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630 
combine in this particular painting that

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:14.780 
combine in this particular painting that
kind<00:00:12.840> of<00:00:12.900> goes<00:00:13.080> up<00:00:13.380> with<00:00:13.860> my<00:00:14.099> style<00:00:14.490> that<00:00:14.700> you

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
kind of goes up with my style that you

kind of goes up with my style that you
see<00:00:15.000> a<00:00:15.030> lot<00:00:15.269> first<00:00:16.230> of<00:00:16.410> all<00:00:16.500> I<00:00:16.560> wanted<00:00:17.039> to<00:00:17.100> do

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
see a lot first of all I wanted to do

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.340 
see a lot first of all I wanted to do
this<00:00:17.550> linear<00:00:18.060> linear<00:00:18.600> background<00:00:19.199> which<00:00:19.289> is

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
this linear linear background which is

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.230 
this linear linear background which is
something<00:00:19.619> that's<00:00:19.710> been<00:00:19.830> new<00:00:20.070> for<00:00:20.340> me<00:00:20.369> I<00:00:20.640> just

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
something that's been new for me I just

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:22.939 
something that's been new for me I just
recently<00:00:21.539> started<00:00:21.810> experimenting<00:00:22.439> and<00:00:22.890> doing

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
recently started experimenting and doing

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:25.220 
recently started experimenting and doing
these<00:00:23.490> these<00:00:24.029> line<00:00:24.300> works<00:00:24.600> in<00:00:24.750> the<00:00:24.810> background

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
these these line works in the background

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:26.839 
these these line works in the background
but<00:00:25.650> I<00:00:25.680> really<00:00:25.920> finding<00:00:26.250> this<00:00:26.369> particular

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
but I really finding this particular

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:28.580 
but I really finding this particular
painting<00:00:27.210> it<00:00:27.330> gives<00:00:27.570> it<00:00:27.689> a<00:00:27.779> lot<00:00:27.930> of<00:00:28.050> depth<00:00:28.320> I

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
painting it gives it a lot of depth I

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.980 
painting it gives it a lot of depth I
really<00:00:29.250> bring<00:00:29.939> pushes<00:00:30.300> the<00:00:30.420> background<00:00:30.810> back

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
really bring pushes the background back

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.380 
really bring pushes the background back
and<00:00:31.289> brings<00:00:31.500> the<00:00:31.650> foreground<00:00:32.009> forward<00:00:32.520> by<00:00:32.910> by

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
and brings the foreground forward by by

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.360 
and brings the foreground forward by by
having<00:00:33.690> these<00:00:33.809> this<00:00:34.140> linear<00:00:34.500> aspect<00:00:35.010> to<00:00:35.250> the

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
having these this linear aspect to the

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.060 
having these this linear aspect to the
painting<00:00:35.700> now<00:00:36.360> that<00:00:36.570> i<00:00:36.600> put<00:00:36.780> this<00:00:36.870> black<00:00:37.170> /<00:00:37.800> and

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
painting now that i put this black / and

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.590 
painting now that i put this black / and
its<00:00:38.160> expressive<00:00:38.700> and<00:00:39.000> it's<00:00:39.149> and<00:00:39.329> it's

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
its expressive and it's and it's

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.090 
its expressive and it's and it's
explosive<00:00:40.440> and<00:00:40.590> it<00:00:40.649> kind<00:00:40.800> of<00:00:40.829> goes<00:00:40.950> with<00:00:41.070> the

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
explosive and it kind of goes with the

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.639 
explosive and it kind of goes with the
song<00:00:41.340> to<00:00:41.640> the<00:00:41.760> boom<00:00:41.940> boom<00:00:42.120> pow<00:00:42.149> song<00:00:42.629> and<00:00:42.870> I

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
song to the boom boom pow song and I

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:45.619 
song to the boom boom pow song and I
really<00:00:44.280> think<00:00:44.430> that<00:00:44.550> really<00:00:45.149> helps<00:00:45.420> bring

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
really think that really helps bring

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.690 
really think that really helps bring
this<00:00:45.750> painting<00:00:46.140> together<00:00:46.260> as<00:00:46.590> well<00:00:46.770> then<00:00:47.550> f

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
this painting together as well then f

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.729 
this painting together as well then f
you<00:00:47.789> see<00:00:48.000> also<00:00:48.420> there's<00:00:48.660> some<00:00:49.170> white<00:00:49.410> lines

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
you see also there's some white lines

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.549 
you see also there's some white lines
and<00:00:50.010> they<00:00:50.160> can<00:00:50.340> uh<00:00:50.460> they<00:00:51.270> run<00:00:51.690> they<00:00:52.079> run<00:00:52.110> up<00:00:52.410> and

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
and they can uh they run they run up and

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:53.750 
and they can uh they run they run up and
down<00:00:52.649> they<00:00:52.920> kind<00:00:53.100> of<00:00:53.129> remind<00:00:53.250> me<00:00:53.550> of<00:00:53.640> like

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
down they kind of remind me of like

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.670 
down they kind of remind me of like
sound<00:00:54.329> waves<00:00:54.539> if<00:00:54.989> you've<00:00:55.140> ever<00:00:55.260> been<00:00:55.500> on<00:00:55.559> the

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
sound waves if you've ever been on the

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.410 
sound waves if you've ever been on the
computer<00:00:55.920> and<00:00:56.370> you<00:00:56.489> and<00:00:56.699> you<00:00:56.789> watch<00:00:57.000> the<00:00:57.030> sound

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
computer and you and you watch the sound

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:58.670 
computer and you and you watch the sound
waves<00:00:57.629> go<00:00:57.809> up<00:00:57.930> and<00:00:58.050> down<00:00:58.140> that's<00:00:58.320> kind<00:00:58.530> of<00:00:58.559> what

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
waves go up and down that's kind of what

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.040 
waves go up and down that's kind of what
those<00:00:58.829> those<00:00:59.129> lines<00:00:59.399> there<00:00:59.730> remind<00:01:00.690> me<00:01:00.809> that<00:01:00.989> I

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
those those lines there remind me that I

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.180 
those those lines there remind me that I
played<00:01:01.289> around<00:01:01.469> with<00:01:01.559> them<00:01:01.739> too<00:01:01.770> trying<00:01:02.100> to

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
played around with them too trying to

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:03.290 
played around with them too trying to
melt<00:01:02.399> them<00:01:02.520> into<00:01:02.670> the<00:01:02.760> background<00:01:03.149> if<00:01:03.210> you

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
melt them into the background if you

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:04.160 
melt them into the background if you
notice<00:01:03.539> there's<00:01:03.690> a<00:01:03.719> little<00:01:03.750> bit<00:01:04.019> of<00:01:04.110> a

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
notice there's a little bit of a

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:05.840 
notice there's a little bit of a
brushstroke<00:01:04.470> on<00:01:05.129> the<00:01:05.309> bottom<00:01:05.670> where<00:01:05.820> the

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
brushstroke on the bottom where the

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.820 
brushstroke on the bottom where the
linear<00:01:06.150> lines<00:01:06.420> go<00:01:06.630> up<00:01:06.750> and<00:01:06.900> down<00:01:07.049> and<00:01:07.320> I<00:01:07.740> was

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
linear lines go up and down and I was

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.080 
linear lines go up and down and I was
just<00:01:08.040> basically<00:01:08.310> what<00:01:08.610> I<00:01:08.640> was<00:01:08.760> trying<00:01:08.939> to<00:01:09.030> do

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
just basically what I was trying to do

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.060 
just basically what I was trying to do
there<00:01:09.299> i<00:01:09.330> was<00:01:09.630> trying<00:01:09.900> to<00:01:09.960> bring<00:01:10.350> that<00:01:10.590> little

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
there i was trying to bring that little

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.690 
there i was trying to bring that little
line<00:01:11.430> element<00:01:11.880> into<00:01:12.090> the<00:01:12.360> background<00:01:12.810> as<00:01:12.930> well

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:13.700 
line element into the background as well

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:16.490 
line element into the background as well
and<00:01:14.700> then<00:01:14.939> these<00:01:15.420> splash<00:01:15.869> actually<00:01:16.350> goes

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
and then these splash actually goes

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.140 
and then these splash actually goes
across<00:01:16.830> the<00:01:17.189> lines<00:01:17.400> as<00:01:17.549> well<00:01:17.700> again<00:01:18.000> just

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
across the lines as well again just

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.840 
across the lines as well again just
combining<00:01:18.450> it<00:01:18.600> all<00:01:18.720> together<00:01:19.009> as<00:01:20.009> well<00:01:20.310> as<00:01:20.580> I

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
combining it all together as well as I

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.190 
combining it all together as well as I
you<00:01:21.240> see<00:01:21.390> a<00:01:21.420> lot<00:01:21.479> of<00:01:21.659> these<00:01:21.840> of<00:01:22.080> these

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
you see a lot of these of these

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.020 
you see a lot of these of these
spherical<00:01:22.650> images<00:01:23.130> from<00:01:23.340> me<00:01:23.490> so<00:01:23.610> I<00:01:23.640> place

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
spherical images from me so I place

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.969 
spherical images from me so I place
again<00:01:24.330> those<00:01:24.509> three<00:01:25.200> spheres<00:01:25.500> and<00:01:25.740> I<00:01:25.799> didn't

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
again those three spheres and I didn't

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:27.230 
again those three spheres and I didn't
just<00:01:26.100> place<00:01:26.280> them<00:01:26.400> randomly<00:01:26.729> this<00:01:26.970> time<00:01:27.119> like

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
just place them randomly this time like

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.270 
just place them randomly this time like

can<00:01:32.579> almost<00:01:32.700> visualize<00:01:33.060> them<00:01:33.659> moving<00:01:33.900> through

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
can almost visualize them moving through

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.170 
can almost visualize them moving through
space<00:01:34.409> moving<00:01:34.950> right<00:01:35.130> across<00:01:35.430> the<00:01:35.640> page<00:01:35.880> that

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
space moving right across the page that

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.660 
space moving right across the page that
one<00:01:36.960> main<00:01:37.680> sphere<00:01:38.070> in<00:01:38.220> the<00:01:38.280> middle<00:01:38.549> is

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
one main sphere in the middle is

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.249 
one main sphere in the middle is
blocking<00:01:39.240> the<00:01:39.270> light<00:01:39.540> which<00:01:39.780> just<00:01:39.960> gives<00:01:40.049> it<00:01:40.170> a

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
blocking the light which just gives it a

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.800 
blocking the light which just gives it a
really<00:01:40.409> good<00:01:40.740> strong<00:01:41.130> feeling<00:01:41.729> and<00:01:42.509> I<00:01:42.570> really

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
really good strong feeling and I really

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.060 
really good strong feeling and I really
think<00:01:42.899> it's<00:01:43.049> a<00:01:43.079> great<00:01:43.200> visual<00:01:43.470> interpretation

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070
