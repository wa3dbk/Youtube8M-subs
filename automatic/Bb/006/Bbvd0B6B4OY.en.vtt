00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:18.039 
this video will show you how to make a

00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:22.830 
this video will show you how to make a
doll<00:00:18.970> head<00:00:19.300> from<00:00:19.539> the<00:00:19.599> homemade<00:00:20.260> mole<00:00:21.599> it<00:00:22.599> can

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:22.840 
doll head from the homemade mole it can

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:27.089 
doll head from the homemade mole it can
be<00:00:22.990> for<00:00:23.169> mass<00:00:23.410> production<00:00:23.439> and<00:00:25.349> now<00:00:26.349> again<00:00:26.800> we

00:00:27.089 --> 00:00:27.099 
be for mass production and now again we

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:30.390 
be for mass production and now again we
will<00:00:27.250> need<00:00:27.460> a<00:00:27.490> play<00:00:28.090> and<00:00:29.009> in<00:00:30.009> a<00:00:30.189> right

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:30.400 
will need a play and in a right

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:34.100 
will need a play and in a right
proportion<00:00:31.410> about<00:00:32.410> half<00:00:32.680> inch<00:00:32.949> diameter<00:00:33.730> and

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
proportion about half inch diameter and

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:39.630 
proportion about half inch diameter and
we<00:00:35.110> will<00:00:35.350> need<00:00:35.590> the<00:00:35.890> clay<00:00:36.160> until<00:00:36.370> soft<00:00:38.610> make<00:00:39.610> a

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:39.640 
we will need the clay until soft make a

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:46.560 
we will need the clay until soft make a
little<00:00:40.030> point<00:00:40.269> again<00:00:40.660> on<00:00:41.019> the<00:00:42.059> clay<00:00:45.510> try<00:00:46.510> to

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:46.570 
little point again on the clay try to

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:53.580 
little point again on the clay try to
smooth<00:00:47.170> the<00:00:47.980> clay<00:00:48.219> also

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:53.590 

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:58.050 

and<00:00:53.710> then<00:00:54.430> we<00:00:54.970> get<00:00:55.150> the<00:00:55.210> mole<00:00:55.570> and<00:00:56.490> brush<00:00:57.490> with

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:58.060 
and then we get the mole and brush with

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:01.200 
and then we get the mole and brush with
the<00:00:58.090> start<00:00:58.870> we<00:00:59.590> will<00:00:59.620> brush<00:01:00.100> everywhere<00:01:00.940> even

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:01.210 
the start we will brush everywhere even

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:09.070 
the start we will brush everywhere even
outside

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:09.080 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:11.770 

and<00:01:09.200> also<00:01:09.890> we<00:01:10.310> will<00:01:10.430> brush<00:01:10.790> the<00:01:11.180> other<00:01:11.360> side<00:01:11.750> of

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:11.780 
and also we will brush the other side of

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:20.820 
and also we will brush the other side of
the<00:01:12.020> mole<00:01:16.750> and<00:01:17.750> then<00:01:18.620> we<00:01:18.860> will<00:01:19.130> push<00:01:19.970> the<00:01:20.240> point

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:20.830 
the mole and then we will push the point

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:24.010 
the mole and then we will push the point
into<00:01:21.830> the<00:01:21.860> most<00:01:22.250> complex<00:01:22.790> detail<00:01:23.330> of<00:01:23.570> the<00:01:23.810> mole

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:24.020 
into the most complex detail of the mole

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:27.640 
into the most complex detail of the mole
which<00:01:24.560> is<00:01:24.770> the<00:01:24.980> nose<00:01:25.220> and<00:01:25.640> the<00:01:26.570> mouth<00:01:26.650> over

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:27.650 
which is the nose and the mouth over

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:31.570 
which is the nose and the mouth over
there<00:01:27.860> and<00:01:28.090> try<00:01:29.090> to<00:01:29.150> push<00:01:29.630> straight<00:01:30.550> into<00:01:31.550> the

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:31.580 
there and try to push straight into the

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:36.430 
there and try to push straight into the
mall<00:01:33.940> so<00:01:34.940> this<00:01:35.180> is<00:01:35.210> the<00:01:35.510> front<00:01:35.750> side<00:01:36.080> of<00:01:36.110> the

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:36.440 
mall so this is the front side of the

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:44.350 
mall so this is the front side of the
fist<00:01:36.980> after<00:01:40.300> that<00:01:41.680> you<00:01:42.680> use<00:01:43.010> the<00:01:43.310> other<00:01:43.360> back

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:44.360 
fist after that you use the other back

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:47.770 
fist after that you use the other back
side<00:01:44.690> of<00:01:45.020> the<00:01:45.260> head<00:01:45.500> put<00:01:46.310> together<00:01:46.670> both<00:01:47.060> side

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:47.780 
side of the head put together both side

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:52.390 
side of the head put together both side
and<00:01:48.200> push<00:01:48.950> carefully<00:01:49.910> and<00:01:50.740> make<00:01:51.740> sure<00:01:51.800> that

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:52.400 
and push carefully and make sure that

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:55.750 
and push carefully and make sure that
all<00:01:52.700> the<00:01:53.240> marks<00:01:53.690> like<00:01:53.960> the<00:01:54.440> black<00:01:54.710> dots<00:01:55.040> are<00:01:55.400> in

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:55.760 
all the marks like the black dots are in

00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:02.770 
all the marks like the black dots are in
place<00:01:56.680> push<00:01:57.680> straight<00:01:58.900> and<00:02:00.880> then<00:02:01.880> open<00:02:02.660> them

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:02.780 
place push straight and then open them

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:07.640 
place push straight and then open them
all

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:07.650 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:12.390 

now<00:02:08.650> you<00:02:08.710> will<00:02:09.100> see<00:02:09.600> this<00:02:10.600> is<00:02:10.870> the<00:02:11.110> back<00:02:11.350> of<00:02:11.890> the

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.400 
now you will see this is the back of the

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:18.780 
now you will see this is the back of the
head<00:02:13.440> we<00:02:14.440> will<00:02:14.620> use<00:02:14.830> a<00:02:16.200> blade<00:02:17.200> or<00:02:17.490> small<00:02:18.490> tools

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
head we will use a blade or small tools

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:24.420 
head we will use a blade or small tools
to<00:02:19.030> cut<00:02:19.210> already<00:02:19.510> exceed<00:02:21.930> clay<00:02:22.930> then<00:02:23.680> used<00:02:24.040> the

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.430 
to cut already exceed clay then used the

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:29.360 
to cut already exceed clay then used the
screw<00:02:25.390> small<00:02:25.990> screwdriver<00:02:27.420> to<00:02:28.420> poke<00:02:28.870> the<00:02:28.900> hole

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
screw small screwdriver to poke the hole

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:35.760 
screw small screwdriver to poke the hole
from<00:02:30.370> the<00:02:30.700> bottom<00:02:31.270> to<00:02:31.300> the<00:02:31.510> top<00:02:31.780> like<00:02:32.050> that<00:02:34.770> and

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:35.770 
from the bottom to the top like that and

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:41.070 
from the bottom to the top like that and
we<00:02:36.010> also<00:02:36.250> go<00:02:36.640> to<00:02:36.700> the<00:02:37.030> other<00:02:37.150> side<00:02:38.460> and<00:02:39.840> then<00:02:40.840> it

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:41.080 
we also go to the other side and then it

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:45.390 
we also go to the other side and then it
will<00:02:41.560> be<00:02:41.920> true<00:02:42.340> like<00:02:42.520> that<00:02:42.790> now<00:02:43.540> to<00:02:43.600> entry<00:02:44.400> pull

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400 
will be true like that now to entry pull

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:51.210 
will be true like that now to entry pull
out<00:02:45.730> of<00:02:45.850> the<00:02:46.390> mall

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:51.220 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:55.370 

so<00:02:51.910> right<00:02:52.120> now<00:02:52.150> you<00:02:52.360> will<00:02:52.750> get<00:02:53.610> this<00:02:54.610> look

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:55.380 
so right now you will get this look

00:02:55.380 --> 00:03:00.720 
so right now you will get this look
still<00:02:56.380> have<00:02:56.650> to<00:02:56.890> touch<00:02:57.160> up<00:02:59.160> need<00:03:00.160> to<00:03:00.340> smooth

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:00.730 
still have to touch up need to smooth

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:04.440 
still have to touch up need to smooth
the<00:03:01.180> whole<00:03:01.390> head<00:03:01.630> again<00:03:02.040> using<00:03:03.040> your<00:03:04.000> finger

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:04.450 
the whole head again using your finger

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:07.560 
the whole head again using your finger
or<00:03:04.720> any<00:03:05.020> kind<00:03:05.350> of<00:03:05.500> tool<00:03:05.770> also<00:03:06.550> cut<00:03:07.060> all<00:03:07.330> the

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:07.570 
or any kind of tool also cut all the

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:15.060 
or any kind of tool also cut all the
ack-ack<00:03:08.010> exceeded<00:03:09.510> clay<00:03:10.510> out<00:03:10.870> of<00:03:11.650> the<00:03:12.330> head<00:03:14.070> so

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:15.070 
ack-ack exceeded clay out of the head so

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:22.980 
ack-ack exceeded clay out of the head so
right<00:03:15.280> now<00:03:15.310> we<00:03:15.490> try<00:03:15.880> to<00:03:15.940> smooth<00:03:16.630> all<00:03:16.960> the<00:03:17.260> heads

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:22.990 

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:28.660 

now<00:03:23.650> it<00:03:24.340> should<00:03:24.610> be<00:03:24.820> somewhat<00:03:25.240> enough

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:28.670 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:34.030 

and<00:03:29.120> then<00:03:29.510> now<00:03:30.200> we<00:03:30.290> have<00:03:30.740> this<00:03:31.569> head<00:03:32.860> to<00:03:33.860> do

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:34.040 
and then now we have this head to do

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:37.930 
and then now we have this head to do
painting<00:03:34.970> again<00:03:35.569> to<00:03:36.020> make<00:03:36.230> sure<00:03:36.670> that<00:03:37.670> the

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:37.940 
painting again to make sure that the

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:40.000 
painting again to make sure that the
whole<00:03:38.150> still<00:03:38.480> there<00:03:38.720> because<00:03:39.170> when<00:03:39.440> we<00:03:39.620> smooth

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:40.010 
whole still there because when we smooth

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:43.270 
whole still there because when we smooth
it<00:03:40.220> it<00:03:40.849> might<00:03:41.510> close<00:03:41.900> the<00:03:42.170> holes<00:03:42.410> or<00:03:42.709> we<00:03:43.099> will

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:43.280 
it it might close the holes or we will

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:50.199 
it it might close the holes or we will
poke<00:03:44.140> using<00:03:45.140> the<00:03:45.380> hour<00:03:45.770> tore<00:03:48.520> the<00:03:49.520> whole<00:03:49.670> whole

00:03:50.199 --> 00:03:50.209 
poke using the hour tore the whole whole

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:53.490 
poke using the hour tore the whole whole
still<00:03:50.540> there

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:53.500 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:56.520 

then<00:03:54.130> we<00:03:54.550> will<00:03:54.730> put<00:03:54.940> in<00:03:55.240> the<00:03:55.630> hard<00:03:55.810> wire<00:03:56.140> and

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:56.530 
then we will put in the hard wire and
