00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:47.479 
we gotta move on to the transformation

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:56.410 
we gotta move on to the transformation
there<00:01:48.479> you<00:01:48.570> go<00:01:50.810> and<00:01:54.259> so<00:01:55.259> the<00:01:55.409> sky<00:01:55.649> roses<00:01:56.009> are

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:22.550 
decided that that's a good idea and the
measurement<00:02:21.600> has<00:02:21.690> special<00:02:22.020> attack<00:02:22.260> with<00:02:22.440> that

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
measurement has special attack with that

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:26.720 
measurement has special attack with that
crap<00:02:24.350> it's<00:02:25.350> pretty<00:02:25.560> useless<00:02:25.860> making<00:02:26.340> skyress

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
crap it's pretty useless making skyress

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:28.790 
crap it's pretty useless making skyress
need<00:02:26.910> a<00:02:27.000> special<00:02:27.360> attack<00:02:27.600> or<00:02:27.900> isn't<00:02:28.530> that<00:02:28.620> like

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800 
need a special attack or isn't that like

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:30.230 
need a special attack or isn't that like
that<00:02:29.010> ideas<00:02:29.340> because<00:02:29.550> it<00:02:29.700> became<00:02:30.000> a<00:02:30.060> lot

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:30.240 
that ideas because it became a lot

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:34.190 
that ideas because it became a lot
easier<00:02:30.420> to<00:02:30.630> find<00:02:30.960> one<00:02:31.910> and<00:02:32.910> burying<00:02:33.690> you<00:02:33.870> buy

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
easier to find one and burying you buy

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.440 
easier to find one and burying you buy
anymore<00:02:34.560> because<00:02:35.160> they<00:02:35.370> know<00:02:35.880> that<00:02:36.150> it's<00:02:36.300> not

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
anymore because they know that it's not

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:38.570 
anymore because they know that it's not
a<00:02:36.510> good<00:02:36.810> idea<00:02:36.840> i<00:02:37.230> didn't<00:02:37.530> i<00:02:37.590> say<00:02:37.770> jump<00:02:38.130> all
