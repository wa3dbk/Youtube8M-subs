 Ilyich Tchaikovsky 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:18.490
 and 

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:37.620
 there then do a quad blowout executed 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:37.620
 but still not unmistakably unfortunately 

00:04:52.669 --> 00:04:57.709
 somewhere to recognize that it is with a big 

00:04:54.959 --> 00:04:59.419
 Likely he without mental hire 

00:04:57.709 --> 00:05:02.189

00:05:02.189 --> 00:05:07.019
 Kawaguchi and Alexander Smirnov, but 

00:05:04.249 --> 00:05:09.719
 unfortunately not all of them 

00:05:07.019 --> 00:05:13.339

00:05:09.719 --> 00:05:13.339

00:05:13.729 --> 00:05:19.660
 Winners are only one 

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:21.530
 one of this is an individual sport 

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:26.150
 contenders for victory often 

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:28.940
 much more no matter what 

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:32.030
 scores will be very high in many ways 

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:34.280
 thanks to the amazing component of this 

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:37.040
 beautiful couple and gorgeous 

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:40.550
 productions and on my own I want to add that 

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:41.690
 I want to arbitrators somehow 

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:45.020
 celebrated 

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:47.270
 proper program that value 

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:50.500
 integrity that cannot be broken 

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:53.270
 even relatively unsuccessful rentals 

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:56.540
 there is a set of elements if break 

00:05:53.270 --> 00:06:00.160
 This manfred on elements that can 

00:05:56.540 --> 00:06:01.960
 Of course find fault and repeatedly but with 

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:05.140
 specific program no breakdown 

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:08.650
 I do not want to do it looks entirely 

00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:11.130
 agree that there is far from 

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:11.130
 all competitors 

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:34.539
 but felt worried Chernyshov 

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:36.969
 working from now on as a 

00:06:34.539 --> 00:06:42.099
 director tries to hide his 

00:06:36.969 --> 00:06:43.659
 Of course, thanks to emotion 

00:06:42.099 --> 00:06:49.629
 tamara nikolaevna 

00:06:43.659 --> 00:06:53.409
 did not work did not work out trite but 

00:06:49.629 --> 00:06:55.630
 this sport wednesday always happen 

00:06:53.409 --> 00:06:59.530
 winners and losers 

00:06:55.630 --> 00:07:04.540
 and south and in Russian how rarely do we hear that 

00:06:59.530 --> 00:07:05.860
 corner dreams kisses frik kisses altogether 

00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:08.850
 says something and even more so 

00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:08.850
 speaks Russian 

00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:21.760
 Be that as it may, the emotions that give 

00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:26.020
 Kawaguchi and Smirnov with their speeches 

00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:29.590
 their name is not necessary to change anything they 

00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:34.880
 piece goods and they alone 

00:07:29.590 --> 00:07:37.160
 self-sufficient markup for components 

00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:40.010
 decent for the technique unfortunately not 

00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:43.280
 as high as we would like and under 

00:07:40.010 --> 00:07:44.810
 the second result will be if the Sasha is not 

00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:47.330
 much higher than 

00:07:44.810 --> 00:07:50.199
 taras frost 

00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:50.199
