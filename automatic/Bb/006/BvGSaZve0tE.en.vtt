00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
down by wrapping a cord around the side

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:11.930 
down by wrapping a cord around the side
of<00:02:08.190> the<00:02:08.369> wings<00:02:09.030> to<00:02:09.479> hold<00:02:09.690> it<00:02:09.840> down<00:02:10.670> later<00:02:11.670> when

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
of the wings to hold it down later when

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.460 
of the wings to hold it down later when
we<00:02:12.060> put<00:02:12.270> it<00:02:12.390> on<00:02:12.510> the<00:02:12.630> spit<00:02:12.900> we'll<00:02:13.080> check<00:02:13.320> it

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
we put it on the spit we'll check it

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.080 
we put it on the spit we'll check it
again<00:02:13.740> and<00:02:13.980> maybe<00:02:14.130> have<00:02:14.400> to<00:02:14.550> tie<00:02:14.760> it<00:02:14.820> up<00:02:14.970> a

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
again and maybe have to tie it up a

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:19.010 
again and maybe have to tie it up a
little<00:02:15.180> more<00:02:16.790> that's<00:02:17.790> pretty<00:02:18.060> much<00:02:18.270> all<00:02:18.720> there

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.020 
little more that's pretty much all there

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:20.990 
little more that's pretty much all there
is<00:02:19.080> to<00:02:19.230> it<00:02:19.620> you<00:02:19.830> just<00:02:20.070> want<00:02:20.340> to<00:02:20.400> make<00:02:20.580> sure<00:02:20.760> that

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
is to it you just want to make sure that

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.310 
is to it you just want to make sure that
it's<00:02:21.150> not<00:02:21.300> gonna<00:02:21.480> flop<00:02:21.810> around

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:22.320 
it's not gonna flop around

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:24.140 
it's not gonna flop around
now<00:02:22.830> you're<00:02:22.980> probably<00:02:23.100> familiar<00:02:23.459> with<00:02:23.820> this

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
now you're probably familiar with this

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:29.210 
now you're probably familiar with this
kind<00:02:25.020> of<00:02:25.260> getup<00:02:25.950> right<00:02:26.100> here<00:02:26.610> and<00:02:28.040> here<00:02:29.040> is

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
kind of getup right here and here is

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:30.890 
kind of getup right here and here is
where<00:02:29.520> you<00:02:29.670> have<00:02:29.820> to<00:02:29.970> just<00:02:30.209> go<00:02:30.390> slow<00:02:30.690> if<00:02:30.870> you

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
where you have to just go slow if you

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:32.630 
where you have to just go slow if you
make<00:02:31.140> a<00:02:31.170> mistake<00:02:31.410> you<00:02:31.800> can<00:02:31.830> always<00:02:32.070> pull<00:02:32.490> it

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
make a mistake you can always pull it

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:36.170 
make a mistake you can always pull it
out<00:02:32.760> and<00:02:33.000> start<00:02:33.180> over<00:02:33.540> again<00:02:34.340> but<00:02:35.340> try<00:02:35.940> not<00:02:35.970> to

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
out and start over again but try not to

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:39.680 
out and start over again but try not to
do<00:02:36.420> that<00:02:36.600> too<00:02:36.810> many<00:02:36.990> times<00:02:38.120> okay<00:02:39.120> so<00:02:39.180> we<00:02:39.510> just

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
do that too many times okay so we just

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:42.110 
do that too many times okay so we just
kind<00:02:39.959> of<00:02:39.989> push<00:02:40.590> it<00:02:40.830> through<00:02:41.100> it<00:02:41.670> goes<00:02:41.880> in

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
kind of push it through it goes in

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.390 
kind of push it through it goes in
pretty<00:02:42.360> easy<00:02:42.630> watch<00:02:43.500> your<00:02:43.709> fingers<00:02:44.070> on<00:02:44.250> the

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
pretty easy watch your fingers on the

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.300 
pretty easy watch your fingers on the
other<00:02:44.489> side

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:46.310 
other side

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:51.010 
other side
okay<00:02:47.890> can<00:02:48.890> you<00:02:48.920> get<00:02:49.130> it<00:02:49.280> through<00:02:49.550> then<00:02:50.480> push<00:02:50.810> it

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:51.020 
okay can you get it through then push it

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:53.920 
okay can you get it through then push it
down<00:02:51.430> and<00:02:52.430> then<00:02:52.490> we're<00:02:53.120> gonna<00:02:53.209> put<00:02:53.569> the<00:02:53.690> top

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:53.930 
down and then we're gonna put the top

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:56.559 
down and then we're gonna put the top
part<00:02:54.560> at<00:02:55.069> the<00:02:55.190> top<00:02:55.430> at<00:02:55.700> the<00:02:55.730> other<00:02:55.970> end<00:02:56.240> of<00:02:56.420> this

00:02:56.559 --> 00:02:56.569 
part at the top at the other end of this

00:02:56.569 --> 00:03:03.010 
part at the top at the other end of this
fifth<00:02:56.930> the<00:02:57.709> gears<00:02:58.010> on<00:02:59.080> okay<00:03:00.080> like<00:03:01.010> this<00:03:02.020> and

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:03.020 
fifth the gears on okay like this and

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:05.050 
fifth the gears on okay like this and
you<00:03:03.200> set<00:03:03.440> it<00:03:03.470> on<00:03:03.680> that<00:03:03.890> little<00:03:04.040> stand<00:03:04.520> so<00:03:05.030> you

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:05.060 
you set it on that little stand so you

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:07.330 
you set it on that little stand so you
can<00:03:05.180> work<00:03:05.510> with<00:03:05.750> it<00:03:05.900> and<00:03:06.590> now<00:03:06.770> we're<00:03:06.950> just<00:03:07.130> kind

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:07.340 
can work with it and now we're just kind

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:09.400 
can work with it and now we're just kind
of<00:03:07.400> rolling<00:03:07.880> around<00:03:08.150> a<00:03:08.569> little<00:03:08.690> bit<00:03:08.989> and<00:03:09.230> make

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:09.410 
of rolling around a little bit and make

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:13.890 
of rolling around a little bit and make
sure<00:03:09.760> that<00:03:10.840> it's<00:03:11.840> all<00:03:12.170> tied<00:03:12.560> up<00:03:12.590> proper

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:13.900 
sure that it's all tied up proper

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:16.240 
sure that it's all tied up proper
because<00:03:14.900> we<00:03:15.050> don't<00:03:15.230> want<00:03:15.530> it<00:03:15.680> to<00:03:15.830> hit<00:03:16.010> the

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:16.250 
because we don't want it to hit the

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:18.910 
because we don't want it to hit the
heating<00:03:17.239> element<00:03:17.690> if<00:03:17.780> the<00:03:17.930> ring<00:03:18.200> gets<00:03:18.590> loose

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:18.920 
heating element if the ring gets loose

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:21.550 
heating element if the ring gets loose
and<00:03:19.269> flops<00:03:20.269> around<00:03:20.510> and<00:03:20.930> hits<00:03:21.080> the<00:03:21.260> heating

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:21.560 
and flops around and hits the heating

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:24.250 
and flops around and hits the heating
element<00:03:21.950> it<00:03:22.040> could<00:03:22.220> start<00:03:22.550> a<00:03:22.640> fire<00:03:23.260> really

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:24.260 
element it could start a fire really

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.710 
element it could start a fire really
messed<00:03:24.470> things<00:03:24.680> up<00:03:25.010> now<00:03:25.850> you<00:03:25.910> can<00:03:26.150> spray<00:03:26.450> on

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:26.720 
messed things up now you can spray on

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:28.900 
messed things up now you can spray on
the<00:03:26.900> olive<00:03:27.260> oil<00:03:27.470> you<00:03:27.709> might<00:03:28.220> want<00:03:28.459> to<00:03:28.489> use

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:28.910 
the olive oil you might want to use

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:32.770 
the olive oil you might want to use
butter<00:03:29.239> instead<00:03:30.100> or<00:03:31.100> you<00:03:31.280> can<00:03:31.459> just<00:03:31.780> pour

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:32.780 
butter instead or you can just pour

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:35.830 
butter instead or you can just pour
olive<00:03:32.989> oil<00:03:33.380> on<00:03:33.590> it<00:03:33.769> and<00:03:33.890> rub<00:03:34.550> it<00:03:34.700> in<00:03:34.850> with<00:03:34.880> your

pepper and then a whole lot of salt

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:51.729 
pepper and then a whole lot of salt
because<00:03:50.239> the<00:03:50.450> skin<00:03:50.720> is<00:03:50.900> on<00:03:51.140> it's<00:03:51.350> just<00:03:51.590> gonna

crackly it's just gonna be great but

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:02.590 
crackly it's just gonna be great but
don't<00:04:01.130> worry<00:04:01.280> about<00:04:01.430> putting<00:04:01.760> too<00:04:02.090> much<00:04:02.299> salt

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:02.600 
don't worry about putting too much salt

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:06.460 
don't worry about putting too much salt
on<00:04:02.810> there<00:04:04.420> and<00:04:05.420> we<00:04:05.600> tied<00:04:05.840> it<00:04:05.870> up<00:04:06.110> just<00:04:06.260> a<00:04:06.440> little

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:06.470 
on there and we tied it up just a little

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:09.970 
on there and we tied it up just a little
bit<00:04:06.890> more<00:04:07.570> so<00:04:08.570> that<00:04:08.600> it<00:04:08.840> doesn't<00:04:09.200> flop<00:04:09.769> around

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:09.980 
bit more so that it doesn't flop around

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:12.880 
bit more so that it doesn't flop around
we<00:04:10.280> did<00:04:10.459> find<00:04:10.760> a<00:04:11.150> wing<00:04:11.420> on<00:04:11.630> there<00:04:11.900> that<00:04:12.140> was<00:04:12.860> a

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:12.890 
we did find a wing on there that was a

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:15.940 
we did find a wing on there that was a
little<00:04:13.220> bit<00:04:13.670> loose<00:04:13.970> so<00:04:14.000> we<00:04:14.299> tied<00:04:14.660> it<00:04:14.690> up<00:04:14.950> but

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:15.950 
little bit loose so we tied it up but

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:23.170 
little bit loose so we tied it up but
one<00:04:16.160> more<00:04:16.400> string<00:04:17.209> around<00:04:17.570> it<00:04:17.810> and<00:04:18.229> tied<00:04:18.530> it<00:04:18.709> up

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:23.180 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:25.550 

it<00:04:24.180> might<00:04:24.389> seem<00:04:24.660> that<00:04:24.930> you're<00:04:25.080> putting<00:04:25.410> too

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:25.560 
it might seem that you're putting too

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:27.980 
it might seem that you're putting too
much<00:04:25.590> salt<00:04:26.010> in<00:04:26.220> which<00:04:26.460> or<00:04:26.639> not<00:04:26.790> okay<00:04:27.750> there's

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:27.990
