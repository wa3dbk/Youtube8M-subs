melt while that's heating up we could

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:54.190 
melt while that's heating up we could
take<00:00:52.340> our<00:00:52.460> chicken<00:00:52.670> breast<00:00:53.059> and<00:00:53.270> sprinkle<00:00:54.110> it

at you once you start to get a nice
crisp<00:01:30.640> brown<00:01:30.970> skin<00:01:31.450> then<00:01:32.170> you<00:01:32.290> could<00:01:32.440> lower

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:32.800 
crisp brown skin then you could lower

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:34.830 
crisp brown skin then you could lower
the<00:01:32.920> temperature<00:01:33.340> and<00:01:33.700> we're<00:01:34.300> probably<00:01:34.630> going

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:34.840 
the temperature and we're probably going

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:36.510 
the temperature and we're probably going
to<00:01:34.900> take<00:01:35.050> this<00:01:35.260> on<00:01:35.500> the<00:01:35.680> stove<00:01:35.740> top<00:01:35.979> of<00:01:36.400> all

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:36.520 
to take this on the stove top of all

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:38.550 
to take this on the stove top of all
three<00:01:36.790> quarters<00:01:37.030> of<00:01:37.150> the<00:01:37.300> way<00:01:37.330> before<00:01:38.080> we<00:01:38.320> then

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:38.560 
three quarters of the way before we then

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:44.520 
three quarters of the way before we then
flip<00:01:38.950> it<00:01:38.979> and<00:01:39.250> pop<00:01:39.520> it<00:01:39.550> in<00:01:39.759> the<00:01:39.850> oven<00:01:43.410> and<00:01:44.410> as

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:44.530 
flip it and pop it in the oven and as

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:46.410 
flip it and pop it in the oven and as
you<00:01:44.619> can<00:01:44.740> see<00:01:44.770> it's<00:01:45.130> creating<00:01:45.520> a<00:01:45.580> nice<00:01:45.790> brown

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:46.420 
you can see it's creating a nice brown

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:48.600 
you can see it's creating a nice brown
crispy<00:01:47.140> skin<00:01:47.619> and<00:01:48.250> we're<00:01:48.340> just<00:01:48.400> going<00:01:48.490> to

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:48.610 
crispy skin and we're just going to

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:50.520 
crispy skin and we're just going to
continue<00:01:48.729> with<00:01:49.270> that<00:01:49.420> for<00:01:49.900> probably<00:01:50.259> another

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:50.530 
continue with that for probably another

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:55.109 
continue with that for probably another
five<00:01:50.950> minutes<00:01:52.890> so<00:01:53.890> our<00:01:54.040> chicken<00:01:54.430> is<00:01:54.580> well<00:01:54.850> over

00:01:55.109 --> 00:01:55.119 
five minutes so our chicken is well over

00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:57.810 
five minutes so our chicken is well over
halfway<00:01:55.330> done<00:01:55.540> we<00:01:56.380> have<00:01:56.500> a<00:01:56.530> beautiful<00:01:56.979> brown

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:57.820
