nervous system it loosens things up so

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:01.080 
nervous system it loosens things up so
think<00:03:59.440> about<00:03:59.560> the<00:03:59.920> applications<00:04:00.610> even<00:04:00.790> for

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:01.090 
think about the applications even for

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:04.470 
think about the applications even for
diabetes<00:04:01.780> for<00:04:02.440> people<00:04:02.830> with<00:04:03.069> Parkinson's<00:04:03.480> so

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:04.480 
diabetes for people with Parkinson's so

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:06.809 
diabetes for people with Parkinson's so
we're<00:04:04.870> going<00:04:05.020> into<00:04:05.349> something<00:04:05.739> called<00:04:06.040> medica

00:04:06.809 --> 00:04:06.819 
we're going into something called medica

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:17.410 
describe what that equipment would be is

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:22.110 
describe what that equipment would be is
it<00:04:17.620> sure<00:04:18.450> the<00:04:19.450> equipment<00:04:20.020> is<00:04:21.000> creating<00:04:22.000> the

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:22.120 
it sure the equipment is creating the

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:24.330 
it sure the equipment is creating the
vacuum<00:04:22.630> and<00:04:22.900> it's<00:04:23.470> also<00:04:23.650> creating<00:04:24.190> the

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:24.340 
vacuum and it's also creating the

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:26.430 
vacuum and it's also creating the
pulsing<00:04:24.849> the<00:04:25.510> thing<00:04:25.750> with<00:04:25.900> the<00:04:26.050> medical

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:26.440 
pulsing the thing with the medical

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:29.130 
pulsing the thing with the medical
equipment<00:04:26.919> is<00:04:27.070> unlike<00:04:27.550> our<00:04:27.900> manual<00:04:28.900> equipment

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:29.140 
equipment is unlike our manual equipment

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:32.219 
equipment is unlike our manual equipment
with<00:04:30.039> the<00:04:30.310> vows<00:04:30.640> knobs<00:04:31.120> everything<00:04:31.840> what<00:04:32.140> we

00:04:32.219 --> 00:04:32.229 
with the vows knobs everything what we

00:04:32.229 --> 00:04:34.409 
with the vows knobs everything what we
can<00:04:32.410> do<00:04:32.530> is<00:04:32.680> adjust<00:04:32.800> the<00:04:33.190> suction<00:04:33.580> below<00:04:34.000> the

can do is adjust the suction below the

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:37.110 
can do is adjust the suction below the
tissue<00:04:34.660> and<00:04:35.200> above<00:04:35.590> so<00:04:35.950> I<00:04:36.520> can<00:04:36.820> go<00:04:36.940> either

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:37.120 
tissue and above so I can go either

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:39.630 
tissue and above so I can go either
really<00:04:37.780> really<00:04:38.020> deep<00:04:38.320> and<00:04:38.620> actually<00:04:39.070> move

the body to move to homeostasis and keep

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:50.740 
the body to move to homeostasis and keep
