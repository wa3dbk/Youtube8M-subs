00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
this is the shifter here all you got to

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.760 
this is the shifter here all you got to
do<00:01:08.490> is<00:01:08.580> push<00:01:08.790> it<00:01:08.820> forward<00:01:09.360> and<00:01:09.540> that's<00:01:10.170> forward

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
do is push it forward and that's forward

this<00:03:10.260> is<00:03:10.379> the<00:03:10.560> post-apocalyptic<00:03:11.519> dune<00:03:12.239> buggy

00:03:12.559 --> 00:03:12.569 
this is the post-apocalyptic dune buggy

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:14.899 
this is the post-apocalyptic dune buggy
this<00:03:13.079> is<00:03:13.230> built<00:03:13.500> from<00:03:13.680> random<00:03:14.310> stuff<00:03:14.609> that<00:03:14.790> you

00:03:14.899 --> 00:03:14.909 
this is built from random stuff that you

00:03:14.909 --> 00:03:17.059 
this is built from random stuff that you
can<00:03:15.060> find<00:03:15.329> laying<00:03:15.659> around<00:03:15.870> so<00:03:16.439> let's<00:03:16.620> say<00:03:16.799> the

00:03:17.059 --> 00:03:17.069 
can find laying around so let's say the

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:18.940 
can find laying around so let's say the
zombie<00:03:17.400> apocalypse<00:03:17.519> does<00:03:18.180> happen<00:03:18.569> and

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:18.950 
zombie apocalypse does happen and

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:21.559 
zombie apocalypse does happen and
there's<00:03:19.950> there's<00:03:20.310> nothing<00:03:21.150> left<00:03:21.359> there's

00:03:21.559 --> 00:03:21.569

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:23.730 
hardly anything left and basically

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:25.429 
hardly anything left and basically
you're<00:03:23.939> just<00:03:23.970> going<00:03:24.269> to<00:03:24.299> scrounge<00:03:24.629> around<00:03:24.959> and

00:03:25.429 --> 00:03:25.439 
you're just going to scrounge around and

00:03:25.439 --> 00:03:27.649 
you're just going to scrounge around and
try<00:03:25.590> to<00:03:25.650> find<00:03:25.950> stuff<00:03:26.639> and<00:03:26.939> throw<00:03:27.359> it<00:03:27.510> together

00:03:27.649 --> 00:03:27.659 
try to find stuff and throw it together

00:03:27.659 --> 00:03:29.479

well<00:03:53.430> I<00:03:53.459> figured<00:03:54.139> I'm<00:03:55.139> going<00:03:55.379> to<00:03:55.440> attach

00:03:55.729 --> 00:03:55.739 
well I figured I'm going to attach

00:03:55.739 --> 00:03:57.830 
well I figured I'm going to attach
something<00:03:56.280> to<00:03:56.549> the<00:03:56.669> back<00:03:56.819> of<00:03:57.060> it<00:03:57.150> and<00:03:57.389> get<00:03:57.690> this

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:57.840 
something to the back of it and get this

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:59.629 
something to the back of it and get this
thing<00:03:58.049> going<00:03:58.109> again<00:03:58.500> so<00:03:58.829> you<00:03:59.129> can<00:03:59.250> take<00:03:59.400> a<00:03:59.430> look

00:03:59.629 --> 00:03:59.639 
thing going again so you can take a look

00:03:59.639 --> 00:04:03.979 
thing going again so you can take a look

structure<00:04:08.430> so<00:04:08.909> basically<00:04:09.299> we're<00:04:09.540> attached

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:09.840 
structure so basically we're attached

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:12.949 
structure so basically we're attached
into<00:04:10.109> the<00:04:10.440> strongest<00:04:11.310> part<00:04:11.609> of<00:04:11.790> the<00:04:12.090> one<00:04:12.930> of

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:28.470 
and then it's those pieces are connected

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:33.550 
and then it's those pieces are connected
into<00:04:28.650> the<00:04:30.260> bump<00:04:31.260> stop<00:04:31.620> of<00:04:31.860> the<00:04:32.460> original

00:04:44.839 --> 00:04:44.849 
of the most solid parts of this this

00:04:44.849 --> 00:04:48.760 
of the most solid parts of this this
1990<00:04:45.479> Firefly<00:04:45.990> and<00:04:46.169> that's<00:04:46.800> bolted<00:04:47.039> into<00:04:47.430> the

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:52.080 
Volkswagen Forks that come off of this

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:53.470 
Volkswagen Forks that come off of this
frame<00:04:52.380> tunnel

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:53.480 
frame tunnel

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:56.500 
frame tunnel
see<00:04:53.720> that<00:04:53.930> I've<00:04:54.080> I've<00:04:54.920> extended<00:04:55.550> the<00:04:55.910> shifter

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:56.510 
see that I've I've extended the shifter

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:59.350 
see that I've I've extended the shifter
now<00:04:57.320> I<00:04:57.350> only<00:04:57.770> place<00:04:58.550> the<00:04:58.730> shifter<00:04:59.090> here

00:04:59.350 --> 00:04:59.360 
now I only place the shifter here

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:00.850 
now I only place the shifter here
because<00:04:59.750> the<00:04:59.900> cable<00:05:00.230> from<00:05:00.290> the<00:05:00.440> transmission

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:00.860 
because the cable from the transmission

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:03.400 
because the cable from the transmission
would<00:05:01.130> only<00:05:01.280> reach<00:05:01.610> about<00:05:01.970> that<00:05:02.150> far<00:05:02.480> and<00:05:02.720> I

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:03.410 
would only reach about that far and I

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:05.530 
would only reach about that far and I
didn't<00:05:03.710> want<00:05:03.920> to<00:05:03.980> extend<00:05:04.430> the<00:05:04.880> cable<00:05:05.360> up<00:05:05.510> to

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:05.540 
didn't want to extend the cable up to

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:08.320 
didn't want to extend the cable up to
the<00:05:05.780> front<00:05:06.310> because<00:05:07.310> I<00:05:07.400> don't<00:05:07.880> have<00:05:08.090> the

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:08.330 
the front because I don't have the

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:11.110 
the front because I don't have the
cables<00:05:08.780> and<00:05:09.080> it<00:05:09.770> was<00:05:09.890> a<00:05:09.920> bit<00:05:10.160> tricky<00:05:10.340> so

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:11.120 
cables and it was a bit tricky so

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:13.180 
cables and it was a bit tricky so
basically<00:05:11.690> I've<00:05:11.900> just<00:05:11.930> put<00:05:12.260> this<00:05:12.410> this<00:05:12.890> rod

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:13.190 
basically I've just put this this rod

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:16.300 
basically I've just put this this rod
here<00:05:13.520> and<00:05:13.730> it<00:05:14.150> works<00:05:14.360> and<00:05:14.660> it<00:05:15.620> just<00:05:15.800> goes<00:05:16.010> up<00:05:16.040> to

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:16.310 
here and it works and it just goes up to

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:18.070 
here and it works and it just goes up to
the<00:05:16.430> front<00:05:16.610> so<00:05:16.880> I<00:05:16.910> can<00:05:17.000> shift<00:05:17.360> it<00:05:17.510> from<00:05:17.780> making

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:18.080 
the front so I can shift it from making

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:20.590 
the front so I can shift it from making
the<00:05:18.260> floor<00:05:18.530> what<00:05:19.430> was<00:05:19.550> left<00:05:19.730> of<00:05:19.970> the<00:05:20.120> floor<00:05:20.330> of

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:20.600 
the floor what was left of the floor of

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:23.440 
the floor what was left of the floor of
the<00:05:20.810> of<00:05:21.020> the<00:05:21.170> 1990<00:05:21.710> Firefly<00:05:22.190> with<00:05:23.180> the<00:05:23.270> two

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:23.450 
the of the 1990 Firefly with the two

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:25.660 
the of the 1990 Firefly with the two
seats<00:05:23.780> I<00:05:23.960> chopped<00:05:24.380> it<00:05:24.560> up<00:05:24.620> and<00:05:24.800> threw<00:05:25.430> it<00:05:25.550> in

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:25.670 
seats I chopped it up and threw it in

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:27.730 
seats I chopped it up and threw it in
here<00:05:25.910> that<00:05:26.090> was<00:05:26.240> on<00:05:26.270> the<00:05:26.510> redneck<00:05:26.870> car<00:05:27.140> so<00:05:27.440> just

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:27.740 
here that was on the redneck car so just

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:32.290 
here that was on the redneck car so just
attached<00:05:28.180> a<00:05:29.180> piece<00:05:29.780> of<00:05:29.990> a<00:05:30.350> 2<00:05:30.680> by<00:05:30.710> 8<00:05:31.130> so<00:05:32.000> it's

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:32.300 
attached a piece of a 2 by 8 so it's

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:36.100 
attached a piece of a 2 by 8 so it's
pretty<00:05:32.540> solid<00:05:32.810> and<00:05:33.700> that's<00:05:34.700> where<00:05:35.030> my<00:05:35.300> gas

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:36.110 
pretty solid and that's where my gas

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:39.160 
pretty solid and that's where my gas
