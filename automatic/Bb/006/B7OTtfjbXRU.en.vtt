named<00:00:10.139> Joe<00:00:10.679> woo<00:00:10.889> came<00:00:11.309> up<00:00:11.429> with<00:00:11.580> the<00:00:11.670> idea<00:00:12.030> he

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
named Joe woo came up with the idea he

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.600 
named Joe woo came up with the idea he
thought<00:00:12.540> of<00:00:12.740> kind<00:00:13.740> of<00:00:13.799> making<00:00:14.130> something<00:00:14.370> that

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
thought of kind of making something that

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.090 
thought of kind of making something that
doubled<00:00:14.940> as<00:00:15.030> a<00:00:15.089> 45<00:00:15.509> adapter<00:00:16.139> as<00:00:16.350> well<00:00:16.410> as<00:00:16.859> a

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
doubled as a 45 adapter as well as a

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.700 
doubled as a 45 adapter as well as a
weight<00:00:17.400> that<00:00:17.730> would<00:00:17.880> actually<00:00:18.330> press<00:00:19.140> down<00:00:19.439> in

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
weight that would actually press down in

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.890 
weight that would actually press down in
the<00:00:19.859> right<00:00:20.039> way<00:00:20.279> on<00:00:20.580> your<00:00:20.850> record<00:00:21.240> to<00:00:21.689> help

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
the right way on your record to help

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.500 
the right way on your record to help
when<00:00:22.500> it<00:00:22.619> spins<00:00:22.980> get<00:00:23.670> the<00:00:23.789> right<00:00:24.000> tracking

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
when it spins get the right tracking

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.660 
when it spins get the right tracking
force<00:00:24.779> a<00:00:25.080> lot<00:00:25.740> of<00:00:25.859> records<00:00:26.189> are<00:00:26.250> very<00:00:26.340> flexible

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
force a lot of records are very flexible

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.089 
force a lot of records are very flexible
and<00:00:27.240> very<00:00:27.330> thin<00:00:27.689> and<00:00:27.930> they<00:00:28.080> get<00:00:28.410> warped<00:00:28.740> easily

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
and very thin and they get warped easily

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.009 
and very thin and they get warped easily
or<00:00:29.279> even<00:00:29.519> slightly<00:00:29.849> warped<00:00:30.090> and<00:00:30.330> every<00:00:30.779> little

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
or even slightly warped and every little

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:32.389 
or even slightly warped and every little
thing<00:00:31.140> like<00:00:31.260> that<00:00:31.439> can<00:00:31.619> actually<00:00:31.800> affect<00:00:32.070> the

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
thing like that can actually affect the

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.580 
thing like that can actually affect the
way<00:00:32.520> your<00:00:32.640> record<00:00:32.969> sounds<00:00:33.390> so<00:00:33.690> if<00:00:34.079> you're

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
way your record sounds so if you're

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.590 
way your record sounds so if you're
serious<00:00:34.980> about<00:00:35.160> your<00:00:35.489> record<00:00:35.670> collecting<00:00:36.270> and

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
serious about your record collecting and

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.930 
serious about your record collecting and
are<00:00:37.260> really<00:00:37.559> into<00:00:38.010> the<00:00:38.250> quality<00:00:38.460> of<00:00:38.850> your

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
are really into the quality of your

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.060 
are really into the quality of your
sound<00:00:39.239> then<00:00:39.840> I<00:00:40.140> think<00:00:40.379> this<00:00:40.559> is<00:00:40.620> something<00:00:40.890> you

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
sound then I think this is something you

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:42.860 
sound then I think this is something you
should<00:00:41.190> invest<00:00:41.700> in<00:00:41.879> it<00:00:42.180> really<00:00:42.450> does<00:00:42.629> make<00:00:42.809> a

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
should invest in it really does make a

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.709 
should invest in it really does make a
difference<00:00:43.340> so<00:00:44.340> this<00:00:44.640> is<00:00:44.760> what<00:00:44.879> it<00:00:44.969> looks<00:00:45.180> like

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
difference so this is what it looks like

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.420 
difference so this is what it looks like
it's<00:00:45.930> made<00:00:46.050> of<00:00:46.170> pure<00:00:46.379> brass<00:00:46.620> so<00:00:47.129> it's<00:00:47.280> not

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
it's made of pure brass so it's not

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.600 
it's made of pure brass so it's not
cheap<00:00:47.760> at<00:00:48.000> all<00:00:48.059> in<00:00:48.539> quality<00:00:49.020> this<00:00:49.770> is<00:00:50.010> the<00:00:50.190> 45

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
cheap at all in quality this is the 45

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.540 
cheap at all in quality this is the 45
record<00:00:50.879> of<00:00:50.969> doctor<00:00:51.300> and<00:00:51.660> then<00:00:52.469> this<00:00:53.010> is<00:00:53.399> the

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
record of doctor and then this is the

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.430 
record of doctor and then this is the
week<00:00:53.699> basically<00:00:54.570> what<00:00:54.750> you<00:00:54.870> do<00:00:54.989> with<00:00:55.140> it<00:00:55.170> is

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
week basically what you do with it is

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.670 
week basically what you do with it is
you<00:00:56.190> set<00:00:56.730> it<00:00:56.850> on<00:00:57.000> the<00:00:57.600> center<00:00:57.989> there's<00:00:58.469> a<00:00:58.530> hole

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
you set it on the center there's a hole

00:00:58.680 --> 00:00:59.930 
you set it on the center there's a hole
in<00:00:58.800> the<00:00:58.859> bottom<00:00:59.100> that<00:00:59.190> where<00:00:59.370> your<00:00:59.460> spindle<00:00:59.820> to

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
in the bottom that where your spindle to

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.849 
in the bottom that where your spindle to
go<00:01:00.090> you<00:01:00.719> place<00:01:00.899> it<00:01:01.050> on<00:01:01.140> top<00:01:01.289> of<00:01:01.350> the<00:01:01.440> record<00:01:01.739> and

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
go you place it on top of the record and

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:03.380 
go you place it on top of the record and
it's<00:01:02.010> not<00:01:02.190> heavy<00:01:02.550> enough<00:01:02.879> where<00:01:02.940> it's<00:01:03.300> gonna

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
it's not heavy enough where it's gonna

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:04.969 
it's not heavy enough where it's gonna
actually<00:01:03.719> cause<00:01:03.899> damage<00:01:04.170> to<00:01:04.379> your<00:01:04.559> record

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
actually cause damage to your record

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:06.950 
actually cause damage to your record
what<00:01:05.519> does<00:01:05.610> it<00:01:05.729> do<00:01:05.820> is<00:01:05.970> just<00:01:06.150> make<00:01:06.360> the<00:01:06.600> area

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
what does it do is just make the area

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.240 
what does it do is just make the area
between<00:01:07.170> the<00:01:07.470> record<00:01:07.799> and<00:01:07.920> the<00:01:07.979> platter

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
between the record and the platter

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.420 
between the record and the platter
flatter<00:01:09.140> in<00:01:10.140> a<00:01:10.409> way<00:01:10.830> that<00:01:11.010> wouldn't<00:01:11.310> be<00:01:11.369> able

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
flatter in a way that wouldn't be able

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.670 
flatter in a way that wouldn't be able
to<00:01:11.610> happen<00:01:11.729> without<00:01:12.030> some<00:01:12.750> kind<00:01:12.869> of<00:01:12.990> weight<00:01:13.530> of

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
to happen without some kind of weight of

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.770 
to happen without some kind of weight of
this<00:01:13.860> kind<00:01:14.100> it<00:01:14.580> increases<00:01:15.180> the<00:01:15.270> detail<00:01:15.600> and

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
this kind it increases the detail and

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:28.319 
this kind it increases the detail and
the<00:01:15.840> accuracy<00:01:16.229> for<00:01:16.409> the<00:01:16.710> tracking

00:01:28.319 --> 00:01:28.329 

00:01:28.329 --> 00:01:31.080 

so<00:01:29.200> we<00:01:29.350> just<00:01:29.530> give<00:01:29.680> it<00:01:29.710> a<00:01:29.829> go<00:01:29.979> and<00:01:30.219> it<00:01:30.759> really

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:31.090 
so we just give it a go and it really

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:32.669 
so we just give it a go and it really
did<00:01:31.299> make<00:01:31.329> a<00:01:31.479> difference<00:01:31.659> it<00:01:32.049> made<00:01:32.200> it<00:01:32.350> sound

00:01:32.669 --> 00:01:32.679 
did make a difference it made it sound

00:01:32.679 --> 00:01:36.240 
did make a difference it made it sound
more<00:01:33.960> thick<00:01:34.960> how<00:01:35.320> would<00:01:35.469> you<00:01:35.590> say<00:01:35.770> the<00:01:35.920> music

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:36.250 
more thick how would you say the music

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:39.450 
more thick how would you say the music
sounds<00:01:36.579> more<00:01:36.759> thick<00:01:37.060> uh<00:01:37.799> it<00:01:38.799> just<00:01:38.829> had<00:01:39.399> a

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:39.460 
sounds more thick uh it just had a

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:41.940 
sounds more thick uh it just had a
crisper<00:01:39.820> sound<00:01:40.060> it<00:01:40.360> wasn't<00:01:40.780> you<00:01:41.590> could<00:01:41.770> you

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:41.950 
crisper sound it wasn't you could you

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:43.440 
crisper sound it wasn't you could you
can<00:01:42.100> notice<00:01:42.429> the<00:01:42.549> difference<00:01:42.579> we<00:01:43.000> tried<00:01:43.210> it<00:01:43.299> on

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:43.450 
can notice the difference we tried it on

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:46.230 
can notice the difference we tried it on
and<00:01:43.750> off<00:01:43.929> and<00:01:44.229> while<00:01:44.979> it<00:01:45.189> was<00:01:45.310> on<00:01:45.520> you<00:01:46.090> could

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:46.240 
and off and while it was on you could

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:49.169 
and off and while it was on you could
actually<00:01:46.450> tell<00:01:46.990> that<00:01:47.319> it<00:01:48.039> had<00:01:48.189> a<00:01:48.219> strong

00:01:49.169 --> 00:01:49.179 
actually tell that it had a strong

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:50.910 
actually tell that it had a strong
connection<00:01:49.509> to<00:01:49.689> the<00:01:49.810> platter<00:01:49.990> if<00:01:50.469> you're

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:50.920 
connection to the platter if you're

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:52.319 
connection to the platter if you're
interested<00:01:51.429> in<00:01:51.520> trying<00:01:51.700> this<00:01:51.850> product<00:01:52.209> out
