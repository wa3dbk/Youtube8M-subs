quickly cover a little bit about holding
your<00:00:09.210> needle<00:00:09.690> in<00:00:09.840> yarn<00:00:10.019> and<00:00:11.090> the<00:00:12.090> main<00:00:12.830> thing

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
your needle in yarn and the main thing

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:15.379 
your needle in yarn and the main thing
that<00:00:13.860> I<00:00:14.070> want<00:00:14.280> to<00:00:14.309> tell<00:00:14.549> you<00:00:14.730> is<00:00:14.880> there<00:00:15.089> is<00:00:15.210> no

right or wrong way

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:19.370 
right or wrong way
you<00:00:17.430> you<00:00:17.880> can<00:00:18.060> put<00:00:18.270> ten<00:00:18.510> people<00:00:18.900> in<00:00:19.050> the<00:00:19.080> room

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
you you can put ten people in the room

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.939 
you you can put ten people in the room
and<00:00:19.770> you<00:00:20.279> know<00:00:20.400> probably<00:00:21.199> eight<00:00:22.199> out<00:00:22.500> of<00:00:22.529> ten

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
and you know probably eight out of ten

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:25.130 
and you know probably eight out of ten
if<00:00:23.279> not<00:00:23.310> nine<00:00:23.699> out<00:00:23.970> of<00:00:24.000> ten<00:00:24.300> are<00:00:24.480> going<00:00:24.689> to<00:00:24.869> hold

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
if not nine out of ten are going to hold

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.560 
if not nine out of ten are going to hold
their<00:00:25.830> yarn<00:00:26.160> in<00:00:26.519> a<00:00:26.609> different<00:00:27.029> way<00:00:27.180> than<00:00:27.449> the

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
their yarn in a different way than the

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.740 
their yarn in a different way than the
rest<00:00:28.010> so<00:00:29.010> so<00:00:29.580> there's<00:00:29.760> no<00:00:30.000> right<00:00:30.210> or<00:00:30.269> wrong<00:00:30.510> way

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
rest so so there's no right or wrong way

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.920 
rest so so there's no right or wrong way
to<00:00:30.779> do<00:00:31.080> it<00:00:31.170> I'm<00:00:31.289> just<00:00:31.470> going<00:00:31.590> to<00:00:31.619> give<00:00:31.859> you<00:00:32.130> some

to do it I'm just going to give you some

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:36.110 
to do it I'm just going to give you some
points<00:00:33.930> of<00:00:34.050> reference<00:00:34.230> so<00:00:34.739> you<00:00:34.800> can<00:00:35.190> use<00:00:35.850> these

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
points of reference so you can use these

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.260 
points of reference so you can use these
to<00:00:36.390> develop<00:00:36.899> your<00:00:37.140> own<00:00:37.200> style<00:00:38.129> now<00:00:38.879> the<00:00:38.940> first

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
to develop your own style now the first

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.389 
to develop your own style now the first
thing<00:00:39.570> that<00:00:39.989> I<00:00:40.530> want<00:00:40.800> to<00:00:40.829> talk<00:00:41.010> about<00:00:41.129> is

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
thing that I want to talk about is

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.610 
thing that I want to talk about is
holding<00:00:41.579> the<00:00:41.910> needles<00:00:42.300> I<00:00:42.480> hold<00:00:43.110> my<00:00:43.230> needles

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
holding the needles I hold my needles

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.529 
holding the needles I hold my needles
just<00:00:44.010> running<00:00:44.370> through<00:00:44.520> my<00:00:44.670> palms<00:00:45.000> I<00:00:45.360> don't

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
just running through my palms I don't

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.569 
just running through my palms I don't
have<00:00:45.750> a<00:00:45.780> real<00:00:46.050> big<00:00:46.320> death<00:00:46.559> grip<00:00:46.890> on<00:00:47.100> them<00:00:47.370> or

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
have a real big death grip on them or

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:50.299 
have a real big death grip on them or
anything<00:00:47.789> like<00:00:48.090> that<00:00:48.149> and<00:00:48.829> I<00:00:49.829> think<00:00:49.890> the

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
anything like that and I think the

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.910 
anything like that and I think the
majority<00:00:50.910> of<00:00:50.940> English<00:00:51.390> knitters<00:00:52.289> probably

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
majority of English knitters probably

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.540 
majority of English knitters probably
hold<00:00:53.789> their<00:00:54.030> needles<00:00:54.600> like<00:00:54.989> this<00:00:55.050> I<00:00:55.590> think<00:00:56.309> I

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
hold their needles like this I think I

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.189 
hold their needles like this I think I
mean<00:00:56.699> as<00:00:56.820> far<00:00:56.850> as<00:00:57.059> I<00:00:57.270> know<00:00:57.329> and<00:00:57.719> from<00:00:57.899> what<00:00:58.079> I've

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
mean as far as I know and from what I've

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.500 
mean as far as I know and from what I've
seen<00:00:58.230> that's<00:00:58.859> the<00:00:59.100> way<00:00:59.250> they<00:00:59.850> do<00:00:59.910> it<00:01:00.239> now<00:01:00.390> I've

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
seen that's the way they do it now I've

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.280 
seen that's the way they do it now I've
seen<00:01:00.719> another<00:01:01.050> lady<00:01:01.350> who<00:01:02.090> actually<00:01:03.260> does<00:01:04.260> a

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
seen another lady who actually does a

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.450 
seen another lady who actually does a
kind<00:01:04.559> of<00:01:04.680> a<00:01:04.769> pencil<00:01:05.159> style<00:01:05.400> on<00:01:05.700> one<00:01:05.970> hand<00:01:06.330> and

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:07.460 
kind of a pencil style on one hand and

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:11.530 
kind of a pencil style on one hand and
overhand<00:01:08.460> on<00:01:08.820> the<00:01:09.150> left<00:01:09.390> side<00:01:09.659> and<00:01:10.049> then<00:01:10.979> I

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:11.540 
overhand on the left side and then I

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:15.890 
overhand on the left side and then I
have<00:01:12.540> seen<00:01:12.869> another<00:01:13.200> lady<00:01:13.560> who<00:01:13.950> did<00:01:14.280> it<00:01:14.900> pencil

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
have seen another lady who did it pencil

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.999 
have seen another lady who did it pencil
style<00:01:16.080> on<00:01:16.409> both<00:01:16.740> sides<00:01:18.650> I'd<00:01:19.650> give<00:01:19.890> you<00:01:19.979> a

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
style on both sides I'd give you a

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:21.890 
style on both sides I'd give you a
little<00:01:20.250> bit<00:01:20.340> more<00:01:20.490> advice<00:01:20.790> about<00:01:21.150> that<00:01:21.390> but<00:01:21.689> I

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
little bit more advice about that but I

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.440 
little bit more advice about that but I
don't<00:01:22.470> really<00:01:22.650> I<00:01:22.979> don't<00:01:23.430> do<00:01:23.790> it<00:01:23.909> that<00:01:23.939> way<00:01:24.210> so<00:01:24.270> I

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
don't really I don't do it that way so I

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:25.609 
don't really I don't do it that way so I
don't<00:01:24.479> know

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
don't know

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:30.350 
don't know
so<00:01:26.159> as<00:01:26.520> we'll<00:01:27.180> move<00:01:27.420> on<00:01:27.659> to<00:01:28.700> holding<00:01:29.700> the<00:01:30.119> yarn

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
so as we'll move on to holding the yarn

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.130 
so as we'll move on to holding the yarn
now<00:01:31.079> I<00:01:31.140> hold<00:01:31.799> my<00:01:32.310> yarn<00:01:32.670> where<00:01:33.119> it's<00:01:33.840> woven

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
now I hold my yarn where it's woven

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.620 
now I hold my yarn where it's woven
through<00:01:34.500> my<00:01:34.680> fingers<00:01:35.189> and<00:01:35.430> then<00:01:36.060> when<00:01:36.299> I<00:01:36.329> hold

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
through my fingers and then when I hold

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.170 
through my fingers and then when I hold
my<00:01:36.780> needle<00:01:37.229> this<00:01:37.530> finger<00:01:37.979> is<00:01:38.250> up<00:01:38.610> you<00:01:39.030> know

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
my needle this finger is up you know

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.300 
my needle this finger is up you know
pretty<00:01:39.630> pretty<00:01:39.990> high<00:01:40.200> and<00:01:40.500> then<00:01:40.950> I<00:01:41.040> had

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
pretty pretty high and then I had

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.219 
pretty pretty high and then I had
another<00:01:41.430> friend<00:01:41.970> you<00:01:42.540> can<00:01:42.689> only<00:01:42.930> show<00:01:43.200> you

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
another friend you can only show you

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.410 
another friend you can only show you
that<00:01:43.470> again<00:01:43.740> real<00:01:43.979> quickly<00:01:44.280> and<00:01:44.700> then<00:01:45.270> I<00:01:45.299> had

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
that again real quickly and then I had

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.030 
that again real quickly and then I had
another<00:01:45.659> friend<00:01:45.899> who<00:01:46.110> really<00:01:46.380> did<00:01:46.770> basically

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
another friend who really did basically

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.480 
another friend who really did basically
the<00:01:47.399> same<00:01:47.579> thing<00:01:48.000> but<00:01:48.680> she<00:01:49.680> kept<00:01:49.950> her<00:01:50.100> finger

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
the same thing but she kept her finger

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.300 
the same thing but she kept her finger
down<00:01:50.700> close<00:01:51.149> and<00:01:51.540> really<00:01:52.229> probably<00:01:52.470> any<00:01:53.070> of

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
down close and really probably any of

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.020 
down close and really probably any of
these<00:01:54.380> variations<00:01:55.380> of<00:01:55.590> yarn<00:01:56.430> weaving<00:01:56.850> through

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
these variations of yarn weaving through

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.030 
these variations of yarn weaving through
your<00:01:57.180> fingers<00:01:57.570> you<00:01:57.810> could<00:01:57.960> do<00:01:58.170> closed<00:01:58.649> or<00:01:59.009> you

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
your fingers you could do closed or you

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.100 
your fingers you could do closed or you
could<00:01:59.310> do<00:01:59.460> far<00:01:59.790> away<00:02:00.030> it's<00:02:00.630> just<00:02:00.899> going<00:02:01.049> to

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
could do far away it's just going to

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:02.810 
could do far away it's just going to
depend<00:02:01.290> on<00:02:01.740> what<00:02:02.040> you<00:02:02.250> feel<00:02:02.430> is<00:02:02.610> more

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
depend on what you feel is more

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.959 
depend on what you feel is more
comfortable<00:02:03.420> for<00:02:03.689> you<00:02:04.100> another<00:02:05.100> way<00:02:05.460> to<00:02:05.520> do<00:02:05.850> it

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
comfortable for you another way to do it

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:07.969 
comfortable for you another way to do it
and<00:02:06.119> I<00:02:06.180> think<00:02:06.450> quite<00:02:06.719> a<00:02:06.899> few<00:02:07.079> people<00:02:07.530> do<00:02:07.860> it

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
and I think quite a few people do it

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:11.949 
and I think quite a few people do it
this<00:02:08.220> way<00:02:08.520> it's<00:02:09.060> kind<00:02:09.390> of<00:02:09.450> what<00:02:09.780> I<00:02:09.810> call<00:02:10.470> the

00:02:11.949 --> 00:02:11.959 
this way it's kind of what I call the

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:13.760 
this way it's kind of what I call the
drop<00:02:12.959> and<00:02:13.230> hole

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
drop and hole

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.790 
drop and hole
method<00:02:14.700> they<00:02:15.600> don't<00:02:15.810> always<00:02:15.990> necessarily

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
method they don't always necessarily

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:22.100 
method they don't always necessarily
have<00:02:17.580> the<00:02:17.970> yarn<00:02:18.390> in<00:02:18.660> their<00:02:19.500> hand<00:02:20.660> they'll<00:02:21.660> hold

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
have the yarn in their hand they'll hold

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:25.640 
have the yarn in their hand they'll hold
it<00:02:22.440> when<00:02:22.650> they're<00:02:22.800> ready<00:02:23.040> to<00:02:23.190> wrap<00:02:23.780> the<00:02:24.780> stitch

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
it when they're ready to wrap the stitch

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:27.830 
it when they're ready to wrap the stitch
so<00:02:26.250> what<00:02:26.640> they'll<00:02:26.820> do<00:02:27.030> is<00:02:27.240> they'll<00:02:27.450> have<00:02:27.630> it<00:02:27.780> in

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
so what they'll do is they'll have it in

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.870 
so what they'll do is they'll have it in
their<00:02:27.960> hand<00:02:28.230> and<00:02:28.470> they'll<00:02:29.100> insert<00:02:29.670> their

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:29.880 
their hand and they'll insert their

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:32.150 
their hand and they'll insert their
needle<00:02:30.270> into<00:02:30.570> the<00:02:30.900> stitch<00:02:31.020> and<00:02:31.620> then<00:02:31.980> they'll

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
needle into the stitch and then they'll

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:35.330 
needle into the stitch and then they'll
take<00:02:32.460> that<00:02:32.730> yarn<00:02:33.030> and<00:02:33.420> come<00:02:33.750> up<00:02:33.900> here<00:02:34.320> and<00:02:34.560> wrap

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
take that yarn and come up here and wrap

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:39.860 
take that yarn and come up here and wrap
it<00:02:35.670> and<00:02:36.000> then<00:02:37.400> knit<00:02:38.400> and<00:02:38.790> they<00:02:39.120> may<00:02:39.330> you<00:02:39.840> know

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
it and then knit and they may you know

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:41.930 
it and then knit and they may you know
do<00:02:40.170> like<00:02:40.200> this<00:02:40.680> or<00:02:41.040> this<00:02:41.190> it<00:02:41.490> doesn't<00:02:41.790> really

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 
do like this or this it doesn't really

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:48.370 
do like this or this it doesn't really
matter<00:02:42.750> so<00:02:44.060> then<00:02:45.060> I've<00:02:45.450> seen<00:02:46.110> a<00:02:46.620> lady<00:02:47.100> that

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:48.380 
matter so then I've seen a lady that

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:54.670 
matter so then I've seen a lady that
held<00:02:49.380> it<00:02:50.510> in<00:02:51.510> the<00:02:51.770> palm<00:02:52.770> of<00:02:53.190> her<00:02:53.490> hand<00:02:53.790> and<00:02:54.180> then

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:54.680 
held it in the palm of her hand and then

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:57.800 
held it in the palm of her hand and then
went<00:02:55.680> around<00:02:55.770> her<00:02:56.130> finger<00:02:56.520> like<00:02:56.550> that<00:02:56.790> I<00:02:57.540> think

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
went around her finger like that I think

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:59.240 
went around her finger like that I think
I've<00:02:57.990> probably<00:02:58.200> got<00:02:58.470> that<00:02:58.620> a<00:02:58.680> little<00:02:58.890> far<00:02:59.130> away

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
I've probably got that a little far away

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:01.880 
I've probably got that a little far away
went<00:02:59.760> around<00:02:59.970> her<00:03:00.090> finger<00:03:00.420> like<00:03:00.630> that<00:03:00.900> or<00:03:01.200> you

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890 
went around her finger like that or you

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:04.280 
went around her finger like that or you
could<00:03:02.070> probably<00:03:02.160> do<00:03:02.520> this<00:03:02.790> it's<00:03:03.660> going<00:03:03.900> to<00:03:04.020> act

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
could probably do this it's going to act

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:07.580 
could probably do this it's going to act
just<00:03:04.620> the<00:03:04.680> opposite<00:03:05.250> way<00:03:05.460> that<00:03:06.020> this<00:03:07.020> feels<00:03:07.260> a

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
just the opposite way that this feels a

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:09.110 
just the opposite way that this feels a
little<00:03:07.620> bit<00:03:07.980> better<00:03:08.280> to<00:03:08.580> me<00:03:08.610> it<00:03:08.850> feels<00:03:08.970> like

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
little bit better to me it feels like

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.510 
little bit better to me it feels like
I'm<00:03:09.300> going<00:03:09.450> to<00:03:09.510> be<00:03:09.570> able<00:03:09.930> to<00:03:10.050> get<00:03:10.260> more<00:03:10.800> pull<00:03:11.130> on

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:11.520 
I'm going to be able to get more pull on

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:13.940 
I'm going to be able to get more pull on
and<00:03:11.910> that's<00:03:12.270> one<00:03:12.810> thing<00:03:13.020> that<00:03:13.230> is<00:03:13.380> important

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950 
and that's one thing that is important

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:16.970 
and that's one thing that is important
for<00:03:14.520> me<00:03:14.670> to<00:03:14.910> let<00:03:15.090> you<00:03:15.270> know<00:03:15.480> is<00:03:15.930> when<00:03:16.470> how<00:03:16.920> you

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 
for me to let you know is when how you

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:20.570 
for me to let you know is when how you
pull<00:03:17.460> on<00:03:17.700> this<00:03:17.910> yarn<00:03:18.300> whether<00:03:18.660> it's<00:03:18.870> a<00:03:19.190> lot<00:03:20.190> or

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:20.580 
pull on this yarn whether it's a lot or

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:22.700 
pull on this yarn whether it's a lot or
a<00:03:20.610> little<00:03:20.700> this<00:03:21.300> is<00:03:21.360> what's<00:03:21.870> going<00:03:22.170> to<00:03:22.260> give

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:22.710 
a little this is what's going to give

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:26.150 
a little this is what's going to give
you<00:03:23.600> help<00:03:24.600> you<00:03:24.780> give<00:03:25.200> you<00:03:25.380> the<00:03:25.560> size<00:03:25.830> of<00:03:26.040> your

you help you give you the size of your
stitches<00:03:26.460> the<00:03:27.300> needle<00:03:27.960> and<00:03:28.080> will<00:03:28.230> give<00:03:28.410> you

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
stitches the needle and will give you

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:31.130 
stitches the needle and will give you
the<00:03:28.650> size<00:03:28.890> of<00:03:29.310> your<00:03:29.820> stitches<00:03:30.210> and<00:03:30.390> also<00:03:30.840> how

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:31.140 
the size of your stitches and also how

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:36.290 
the size of your stitches and also how
much<00:03:31.470> you<00:03:31.650> pull<00:03:31.980> on<00:03:32.310> this<00:03:32.610> and<00:03:34.370> as<00:03:35.370> you

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:36.300 
much you pull on this and as you

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:38.000 
much you pull on this and as you
progress<00:03:36.510> in<00:03:36.930> your<00:03:36.960> knitting<00:03:37.470> you'll<00:03:37.740> get

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:38.010 
progress in your knitting you'll get

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:40.880 
progress in your knitting you'll get
more<00:03:38.310> consistent<00:03:39.090> about<00:03:39.420> how<00:03:39.780> you're<00:03:40.560> pulling

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:40.890 
more consistent about how you're pulling

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:44.300 
more consistent about how you're pulling
on<00:03:41.280> it<00:03:41.370> when<00:03:42.000> you<00:03:42.120> probably<00:03:42.630> when<00:03:42.960> you're<00:03:43.650> not

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:44.310 
on it when you probably when you're not

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:47.630 
on it when you probably when you're not
having<00:03:44.760> to<00:03:44.910> think<00:03:45.150> too<00:03:45.960> much<00:03:45.990> about<00:03:46.640> actual

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:47.640 
having to think too much about actual

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:50.360 
having to think too much about actual
insert<00:03:48.300> of<00:03:48.660> your<00:03:49.050> needle<00:03:49.440> and<00:03:49.650> all<00:03:49.890> that<00:03:50.190> and

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:50.370 
insert of your needle and all that and

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:53.120 
insert of your needle and all that and
what<00:03:50.580> to<00:03:50.790> do<00:03:51.000> this<00:03:51.840> will<00:03:52.200> become<00:03:52.620> more

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:53.130 
what to do this will become more

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:56.270 
what to do this will become more
consistent<00:03:53.730> over<00:03:54.480> time<00:03:54.510> but<00:03:55.410> just<00:03:55.740> remember

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:56.280 
consistent over time but just remember

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:59.660 
consistent over time but just remember
how<00:03:56.610> you<00:03:56.670> pull<00:03:57.240> on<00:03:57.690> this<00:03:58.410> yarn<00:03:58.740> is<00:03:59.100> going<00:03:59.460> to

00:03:59.660 --> 00:03:59.670 
how you pull on this yarn is going to

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:02.630 
how you pull on this yarn is going to
determine<00:04:00.360> the<00:04:00.990> size<00:04:01.290> of<00:04:01.560> your<00:04:01.620> stitches<00:04:02.130> and

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:02.640 
determine the size of your stitches and

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:06.800 
determine the size of your stitches and
the<00:04:02.850> consistency<00:04:03.540> of<00:04:03.930> your<00:04:04.350> stitches<00:04:05.090> so<00:04:06.090> um

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:06.810 
the consistency of your stitches so um

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:13.790 
the consistency of your stitches so um
the<00:04:07.740> next<00:04:08.580> one<00:04:09.330> is<00:04:10.700> is<00:04:11.700> a<00:04:11.760> little<00:04:12.330> more<00:04:12.800> the

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:13.800 
the next one is is a little more the

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:16.160 
the next one is is a little more the
same<00:04:14.040> I'm<00:04:14.340> missing<00:04:14.760> one<00:04:15.000> oh<00:04:15.150> yeah<00:04:15.480> there<00:04:15.990> was

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:16.170 
same I'm missing one oh yeah there was

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:20.539 
same I'm missing one oh yeah there was

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:34.620 
from it or do something totally

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:37.100 
from it or do something totally
different<00:05:34.890> but<00:05:35.580> it's<00:05:36.030> just<00:05:36.270> a<00:05:36.420> good<00:05:36.600> starting

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:37.110
