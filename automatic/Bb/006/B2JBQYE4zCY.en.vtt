 greetings to fresh toast message 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.310
 sent with us for a long time nothing 

00:00:30.419 --> 00:00:35.180
 as I said practical part of the study 

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:38.510
 is exhausting and after you 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:41.399
 comes home after a long day 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:44.280
 against it very quickly on the couch well 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:47.399
 in any case, do not start getting here 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:49.559
 one if you are little gods of the collection 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:52.440
 of america cards no original 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:56.690
 komani can still be very nice with 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.690
 the old style 

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:07.550
 the 3d effect of still regarding oracle 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:10.620
 we are still actively mobile 

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:14.370
 but how aimless with the normal 

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:18.660
 cards if you need it write us 

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:20.660
 a message or comments that 

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:22.470
 Video 

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:23.400
 if your card is not right 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.500
 You can also recognize us 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.700
 ask 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:29.550
 I think that's all too good 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.900
 see if you need something not 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:32.190
 In the legs is also easy 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:37.670
 ask because here I do not have all 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:37.670
 Edge in it because it would be just too much 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:46.430
 the interactive progresses 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:50.509
 we have been telling about it for a while now 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:52.939
 half a year the problem is it is 

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:54.979
 just a lot of work we have 

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:56.509
 already several hours for several days 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:57.549
 to the laws of this interactive too 

00:01:56.509 --> 00:01:59.659
 play through 

00:01:57.549 --> 00:02:02.240
 if we soon open the trailer 

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:04.399
 you set our channel with it ever 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:05.840
 but have a little taste 

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:13.250
 it does not take too long anymore 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:19.340
 I can promise that as well as here 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:21.709
 down below so here's a few more 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:22.880
 comments right and then still on 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:25.190
 end in the dax 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:27.280
 if you needed and that was it 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:29.360
 already with mine in a video 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:31.670
 if you liked it all then 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:34.209

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:34.209
