00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:41.570 
foreign them the next step from here is

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:44.020

taking<00:00:42.020> off<00:00:42.170> your<00:00:42.350> grip<00:00:42.559> tape<00:00:42.739> now<00:00:43.579> this<00:00:43.880> is

taking off your grip tape now this is

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:46.030 
taking off your grip tape now this is
quite<00:00:44.180> hard<00:00:44.450> because<00:00:44.690> it<00:00:45.140> seems<00:00:45.590> like<00:00:45.829> they

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:46.040 
quite hard because it seems like they

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:49.420 
quite hard because it seems like they
have<00:00:46.070> cleared<00:00:46.910> the<00:00:47.059> grip<00:00:47.239> tape<00:00:47.420> onto<00:00:47.690> here<00:00:48.430> so

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:14.890 
scalpel and just poking holes in these

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:21.940 
scalpel and just poking holes in these
