00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.210
 well that humiliates him words that I hope 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:04.740
 that you are well we end up 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:06.960
 today for a video review 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:09.090
 second chance so this is the first 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.860
 once I make this kind of videos in 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:11.880
 the meaning that I'm going to give a second 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.799
 chance to a product that I had 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.000
 completely hated there is a little more 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:17.100
 a year ago when I made you the 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.859
 first review and so this is the 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.750
 chantilly of dtm so a mown 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:23.340
 antilles that dries outdoors that 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.580
 I returned to the same color so in 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:28.769
 white and I will be able to make you a 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:31.019
 little test of this product that apparently 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:32.489
 would have changed composition and who I 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:35.130
 the hope will be much better than the first 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:37.500
 time since I saw other people 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.149
 use and I noticed that the 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.450
 texture was not the same at all and 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:45.329
 so the use either so since 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:47.670
 apparently the texture has changed and the 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.350
 composition also maybe that my 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.390
 notice it will also change so that's 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.730
 why I bought the product so we 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.190
 found in 50 gram format as 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.350
 usually brought by dtm was 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.539
 manufactured by an Asian factory and 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:03.870
 this is at the level of the composition we are 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:05.010
 French standards and concerning 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.210
 then the packaging is enough 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.979
 particular compared to others 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.710
 conditioning in the sense that we are 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:13.350
 found with a small pouch 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:14.460
 triangular that will make marks if 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.720
 you use it as a pocket to 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.820
 socket or what am I going to do me 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:21.030
 because I do not know how to do otherwise 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:23.820
 I started making samples 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:26.490
 with them the building laugh she so that's me 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.829
 seems logical to take here and the 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.060
 turn finally shows you just now 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:32.670
 so it's true that the pocket here is going 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:35.610
 to score and after a while that risk 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:38.030
 sometimes damaging your product 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.990
 But that's how it is 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:42.060
 about the end then that's it 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.399
 true that this is one of the positives 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.920
 major product is that we have a 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:48.659
 plug so there you really have a 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.780
 hermetic closure of the product your 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:54.630
 Chantilly is clearly lucky 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.770
 drying it is closed also among 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.810
 our losses that I have not yet 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:01.200
 open and it is also provided 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:03.689
 with three different sockets so 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.219
 especially the star socket that will us 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:07.170
 serve 

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:07.800
 the other two are pretty simple 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:12.030
 a round 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:14.400
 and a notched plate found 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:16.470
 also a plug and this again a 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:19.710
 time it's a good thing does it 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:21.330
 that they have the cap here and the 

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:24.330
 cap like these which allows you to 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:26.460
 leave your soft connect to the pocket 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:27.720
 I think it's very good and it's true 

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:29.220
 that it's one of the few positives 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:32.940
 that I had found at the time 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:34.740
 regarding the aspect it does not seem that 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:37.350
 when I ordered the first 

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:39.960
 time this product there was this aspect a 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:42.270
 little creamy on the packaging 

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:46.170
 so that's maybe it can do 

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:49.400
 part of the texture that changed the 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:52.110
 composition so here I am I know 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:52.500
 quite happy already to see that there it has 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:54.150
 exchange 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:56.430
 and so I will immediately move to 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:58.890
 connection of the dauge to the opening of 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:00.390
 the opera kull and we will test on who 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:02.840
 the little creations that I prepared 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:02.840
 me 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:18.200
 we're going to plug the star socket 

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:20.690
 which is the most used when you want 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:21.260
 do some building sites so we'll see what 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:23.360
 that gives 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:24.680
 I do not know what it's going to give 

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:27.080
 in any case I hope it will be good 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:29.120
 far than the first time so I 

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:30.890
 will press here so there we have more 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:33.500
 whipped the banda so I'm going to squeeze 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:35.180
 between the two series pretty strong and 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:37.069
 again I will use the 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:40.280
 palm of the hand to apply a 

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:45.709
 some pressure so let's see what that 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:49.030
 gives wages strong but it looks 

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:51.590
 much better and I'm pretty happy 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:52.760
 good then we will go to cupcakes so 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:54.799
 I will start with the biggest 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:57.920
 again me what I like 

00:03:54.799 --> 00:04:01.310
 in the sockets in when done 

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:03.530
 the normal use of one another 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:05.360
 products is that we can use the 

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:07.280
 showers we want there we only have three 

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:08.569
 choice and I find it a shame because 

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:10.400
 it's a socket 

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:12.950
 we will say moderately large for the 

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:14.989
 miniature and I prefer to use 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:16.039
 much larger doses and that's right 

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:18.680
 that that does not offer us the 

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:24.560
 opportunity to choose note 2 is the 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:30.169
 it's gone then there then hop we have 

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:32.840
 super posters so air bubbles I 

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:34.639
 am not mega fan of air bubbles and 

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:35.750
 that's fine then maybe you 

00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:37.220
 saw it while I was going 

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:38.660
 apply 

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:43.010
 Well, it's still shaking 

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:46.100
 so it's still better than the 

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:47.330
 first time for sure because the 

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:50.690
 first time I was not even able 

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:53.600
 to get you out of this but it stays 

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:56.960
 not even very very very malleable 

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:59.450
 I saw better my marshmallow so and 

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:01.700
 well indeed the composition of the 

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:03.950
 product has necessarily changed because 

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:07.460
 otherwise clearly I could not have 

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:08.840
 do it benefit so I had you 

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:11.750
 says of the cap is that once 

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:15.200
 you're done cleaning up here you go 

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:18.050
 your your bushings and putting in 

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:20.120
 plugs that closes very very well you 

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:20.750
 are sure to have a whipped cream that is not 

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:23.570
 not dry 

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:24.710
 here when you would reuse it sees 

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:27.890
 the marshmallow friend and well I'll go 

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:30.169
 leave with some pictures of a 

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:32.360
 ice cutting composition with the 

00:05:30.169 --> 00:05:34.250
 the product is also gifted grout 

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:36.230
 caramel apple that I love enormously 

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:38.690
 you will see someone wheelie have been 

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:40.370
 made with modena paste at chrs si 

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:42.890
 you want to redo also to the 

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:46.060
 hand and on this I tell you to very 

00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:46.060
 soon for new videos
