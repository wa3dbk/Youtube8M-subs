telling<00:02:55.480> you<00:02:55.630> these<00:02:55.810> crinkles<00:02:56.319> you<00:02:56.860> do<00:02:57.010> what<00:02:57.160> I

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:57.340 
telling you these crinkles you do what I

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:59.430 
telling you these crinkles you do what I
don't<00:02:57.519> know<00:02:57.640> I<00:02:57.850> didn't<00:02:58.150> use<00:02:58.300> any<00:02:58.540> moon<00:02:58.750> but<00:02:59.410> i

00:02:59.430 --> 00:02:59.440 
don't know I didn't use any moon but i

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:03.509 
don't know I didn't use any moon but i
need<00:02:59.739> to<00:02:59.769> do<00:02:59.920> it<00:03:00.100> of<00:03:00.610> course<00:03:01.060> while<00:03:01.600> it<00:03:01.930> was<00:03:02.519> wet

00:03:03.509 --> 00:03:03.519 
need to do it of course while it was wet

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:08.610 
need to do it of course while it was wet
so<00:03:03.880> the<00:03:04.600> criticals<00:03:05.200> usually<00:03:05.650> stay<00:03:07.110> tuned<00:03:08.110> two

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:08.620 
so the criticals usually stay tuned two

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:11.100 
so the criticals usually stay tuned two
weeks<00:03:08.890> two<00:03:09.250> and<00:03:09.400> a<00:03:09.459> half<00:03:09.610> weeks<00:03:09.720> so<00:03:10.720> it<00:03:10.989> all

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:11.110 
weeks two and a half weeks so it all

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:13.500 
weeks two and a half weeks so it all
depends<00:03:11.500> on<00:03:11.769> when<00:03:12.010> your<00:03:12.340> hair<00:03:12.489> texture<00:03:12.940> the
