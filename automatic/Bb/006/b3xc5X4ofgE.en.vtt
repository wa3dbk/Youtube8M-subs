00:00:11.175 --> 00:00:13.175
 Lasse, a really good news that you have extended your contract 

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:15.820
 What do you say to it all? 

00:00:17.435 --> 00:00:19.435
 Well it's actually gone 

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:21.840
 relatively painless I would say 

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:24.520
 Right from the start 

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:26.620
 I have shown interest in Lyngby 

00:00:26.715 --> 00:00:28.715
 and Lyngby has shown interest in me 

00:00:28.715 --> 00:00:30.040
 So it wasn't hard to get into the house 

00:00:30.274 --> 00:00:32.274
 I feel that even though I've only been here 

00:00:32.274 --> 00:00:34.000
 for 2.5 years that Lyngby is my club 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.820
 So it was the easiest decision for a long time 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:38.890
 After all, you had back for half a year 

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:40.900
 of your old contract, you were not 

00:00:41.554 --> 00:00:43.554
 tempted by something else, or was it 

00:00:43.554 --> 00:00:44.994
 just Lyngby you had focus on? 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.420
 All football players have ambitions 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:49.380
 to play at as high a level as possible 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:52.360
 But the ambitions I have for football 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:54.282
 they have Lyngby as well 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.600
 I'd rather redeem them with Lyngby 

00:00:57.835 --> 00:00:59.835
 In the end, it is up to us to deliver 

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:01.880
 so we can come up where we belong 

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:03.040
 But of course there are also many other clubs 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:04.295
 who is fighting for it 

00:01:04.295 --> 00:01:05.725
 But the goal is of course to get up there 

00:01:05.725 --> 00:01:07.349
 Whether it will be this year or next year, we must see. 

00:01:07.349 --> 00:01:09.280
 There was never really any doubt that Lyngby was 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:12.180
 I'd rather and luckily Lyngby had the same way 

00:01:13.094 --> 00:01:15.094
 They also wanted to extend the cooperation 

00:01:15.094 --> 00:01:16.974
 So it didn't take long to agree 

00:01:19.275 --> 00:01:21.275
 It's a big job we have in front of us, and I'm e 

00:01:21.466 --> 00:01:23.466
 of those who have to pull the load and go ahead 

00:01:23.466 --> 00:01:24.520
 I'm aware of that 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:26.820
 It's the other "older" in the squad too 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.060
 Maybe I'm not the same type as Tauber 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:30.780
 where he leads more out of court 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:31.760
 than I do 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:34.060
 Of course I do what I can 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.380
 and would like to do even more 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:38.188
 both to have a good impact on the young 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:40.240
 but also go ahead on the track 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:42.360
 The things I could do in Brønshøj 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:43.340
 and which characterized me was, 

00:01:43.957 --> 00:01:45.957
 that I always challenged and created chances for myself 

00:01:45.957 --> 00:01:47.200
 and my teammates 

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:50.120
 I've still done that in Lyngby 

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:51.875
 but probably more for others than myself 

00:01:51.875 --> 00:01:53.756
 I'd like to score some more goals 

00:01:53.835 --> 00:01:55.835
 But in the end, it's about whether we win 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:58.220
 And I do everything I can to contribute 

00:01:58.953 --> 00:02:00.953
 for both training and fighting 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:07.800
 Of course there have been some things I should learn 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:09.174
 But I actually called it came relatively quickly 

00:02:09.174 --> 00:02:10.860
 If I can get it combined I was good at in Brønshøj 

00:02:10.996 --> 00:02:12.996
 with what I have become really good at in Lyngby 

00:02:12.996 --> 00:02:14.320
 Then it will probably go up in unity 

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:16.120
 How great a meaning it has in common 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.200
 You have on the team for such a decision 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:18.780
 like the one you hit? 

00:02:19.335 --> 00:02:21.335
 Of course, that means something 

00:02:21.335 --> 00:02:22.840
 If you are well off the track, it is also easier 

00:02:24.635 --> 00:02:26.635
 Of course, it has a huge influence 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:28.980
 There are some on the team that I see 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:29.580
 some of them a little more than I want me 

00:02:30.434 --> 00:02:32.434
 but not I have some really good friends 

00:02:32.434 --> 00:02:34.378
 out here and some have become my best friends. 

00:02:36.727 --> 00:02:38.727
 Lyngby is my family 

00:02:38.913 --> 00:02:40.913
 and i love it all out here, the players, the coaches, the fans 

00:02:41.915 --> 00:02:43.915
 all 

00:02:43.915 --> 00:02:44.794
 so I couldn't be happier 

00:02:45.015 --> 00:02:47.015
 So it's a real Lasse Fosgaard package you can get out here? 

00:02:47.596 --> 00:02:49.596
 Yes, one must say - I am fully satisfied 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:52.120
 I got it amazing so it was an easy decision 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:54.120
 I can honestly say that.
