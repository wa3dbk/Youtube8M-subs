00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
 and in our eternal space today 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:06.480
 we have a special moment we are with 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.700
 max pedreira when business well very 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:10.620
 well we are ready to paint I will 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:13.559
 provide we are going to do a little bit of 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.570
 insert good and we will do 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:18.900
 explains some decorative techniques for 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:20.490
 make a level picture at a rapid level 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.340
 decorative and abstract to be able 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:26.160
 decorate and play a little with the 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.090
 color if we pass a background that comes the 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.310
 red the black 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.810
 so let's make a fund of one 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.489
 crisis like this red professional 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.680
 vermillion we have where it was from in the 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:36.210
 As we are doing, we are going to 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.460
 start painting the curtain to see with the 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:42.660
 hands in the dough 'idea is to smear a 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:44.640
 little bit and make the base of the east 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.579
 frame follows 7 acrylic that piola 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:50.550
 right away as cover comes professional 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:54.500
 it is very thick I know self study 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:56.240
 what displacement of color you have 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:59.590
 and then the idea is to first cover 

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:59.590
 the whole base 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:06.440
 if I was going to show you more than anything 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:09.320
 some images on the screen and I comment 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:11.990
 On May 19 I go to a seminar of this 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:13.940
 Reflection and decoration techniques in 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:15.560
 what it is to play a little bit with the 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:17.930
 color see a bit of color theory 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:20.990
 see the composition theme play with 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:23.860
 collisions of strong color and we go to the 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:26.320
 'armed' contrasting and this 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:29.410
 play with certain colors that are not 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:31.780
 too shocking with all the 

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:33.070
 lands with reds with blacks and more than 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:36.040
 nothing the composition of works that is 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:38.820
 fundamental within the fraction now 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:38.820
 we continue with the black 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.909
 in this case with the black it is of low sea 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:47.100
 a brown that is what we need a 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:49.380
 transition to get to brown 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.450
 exactly then and it follows us like this 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.159
 half soil also where the brushstroke 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.990
 Exactly exactly that is up to very good 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:56.939
 without leaving much upwards but this 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.770
 kind of effects are very interesting 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:00.869
 and now if the black down well covered 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:03.719
 as I tell you a little more about the 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:06.359
 seminar is a seminar where they go to 

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:09.479
 make two 20 x 80 squares 

00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:11.430
 centimeters with different games of 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:13.260
 colors and different oil techniques 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:15.450
 of abstraction now when we finish 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:17.970
 this base I will show you a little 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:19.770
 what would this be 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:21.930
 the development that you will see in the center 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:24.810
 and we're going to play with the dribbles and there 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:26.670
 I want to see a little to explain more 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:29.280
 that nothing and that consists of closed and 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:31.880
 how is it generated with this let's do 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.880
 bad here 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:38.610
 we are going to be doing there is also a 

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:40.050
 little abstract paintings I want 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:42.030
 demonstrate other different techniques 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:45.120
 within the selection to demonstrate 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:48.390
 the materials of eternal that is clear 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:51.830
 how to combine certain this effects with 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:51.830
 golden perfect 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:56.250
 and other mixes these combinations 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:58.680
 good is what we are going to do we are going to 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:01.080
 grab another yellow green brush from 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:02.940
 napoles in this case what as grams 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:07.709
 saying for the cigar in the center I'm going to 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:10.630
 make an effect which makes me a 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:13.510
 dialogue what 

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:15.870
 It suits the two colors that one of 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:17.760
 the two colors 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:19.680
 loose brush strokes slow brush strokes 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:22.430
 clear a bristle brush stroke in 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:27.299
 this case but more than anything make a 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:30.659
 kind of circles spots the idea is 

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:33.110
 play with the color here not cent now 

00:03:30.659 --> 00:03:38.220
 let's take for example a color like 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:41.410
 the yellow na by the ocher and we are going to 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:43.570
 make another little game by going around 

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:46.450
 with some circles I will balance a 

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:47.910
 little color in this good man a 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:50.880
 little with 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:53.150
 and these movements certain things that I 

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:55.909
 balance 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:57.230
 the whole composition think I'm 

00:03:55.909 --> 00:03:59.470
 playing project with some spots of 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:59.470
 some 

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:06.319
 well now the last step to all this 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:09.709
 is to work we are going to work we are going to 

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:12.640
 put at the end of the floor and let's do 

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:12.640
 some dripped on 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:17.690
 ballack has mixed that makes it 

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:24.530
 well elastic the color 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:26.570
 good good let's paint you are friends 

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:28.790
 is that I love this because it's a 

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:31.699
 action painting we 're going to do it so 

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:33.979
 now to enjoy with the painting that 

00:04:31.699 --> 00:04:36.199
 we have prepared there that this is how 

00:04:33.979 --> 00:04:39.400
 the with macaco oils does not do well to 

00:04:36.199 --> 00:04:42.200
 painting an effect similar to synthetic 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:44.270
 of old cans with good paint 

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:46.610
 science style is good painting 

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:48.320
 as a thread that clear community and what 

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:49.729
 what we are going to see is unite finished 

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:51.590
 integrate everything is to say you tell how it goes 

00:04:49.729 --> 00:04:55.120
 to change all this of course without 

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:55.120
 saturate seeing where I'm going to play 

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:07.980
 it fascinates me because it's like a 

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:10.860
 clear writing 

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:14.390
 graficÃ³ good now let's move to the 

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:14.390
 shellac with black 

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:20.070
 with the tail of a brush for the part 

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:23.640
 from the colita of my friends here we go to 

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:26.450
 finish generating the effect inclusive 

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:26.450
 if you put him 

00:05:30.129 --> 00:05:35.419
 more or less less color is done a little 

00:05:33.499 --> 00:05:37.780
 more translucent and more chic those that the 

00:05:35.419 --> 00:05:37.780
 technique 

00:05:44.139 --> 00:05:55.939
 it is also affirmed in a bit more 

00:05:52.389 --> 00:05:58.490
 On May 19 this has all the 

00:05:55.939 --> 00:06:00.560
 contacts to say delete I am 

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:03.960
 each one is going to make two racks of 

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:07.930
 80 for a meter of 20 x 80 sorry 

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:11.259
 this when this pressure 

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:19.930
 20 x 80 and the idea is to play with the 

00:06:11.259 --> 00:06:24.190
 color the color is great we're going to 

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:30.660
 improvise with great variations 

00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:30.660
 thank you very much then we continue
