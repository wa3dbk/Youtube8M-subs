00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:07.080
 another video here on technology pc 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:10.580
 in today's video I'll show you this 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:13.500
 panoramic roof at the seat leon str 

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:14.519
 yes the panoramic roof splits in two 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.890
 parts 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:19.560
 we once have the back part of the 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.510
 as a fixed and required part can be 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.720
 completely push over the rear part 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:26.789
 yes and the panoramic roof costs 890 euro 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.650
 extra at leon str 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:30.570
 the a public area with the 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:37.469
 key to do this we need the button 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:41.420
 hold down and now push yourself 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:41.420
 the front one was on fire 

00:00:44.379 --> 00:00:49.399
 yes, there we have a wind deflector 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:51.199
 the drive automatically with out have 

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:52.969
 that matters and the choice 

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:54.589
 practically prevent that too much wind 

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:58.250
 into the interior when you get that 

00:00:54.589 --> 00:01:00.140
 open roof always have that 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:03.140
 roof over the 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:05.649
 button flow and pressed again 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:05.649
 hold 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:17.450
 the panoramic roof ultimately natural 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:20.090
 also served here on this switch 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:21.260
 About this rotary switch we have here 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:23.060
 two pillars 

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:25.190
 If I am here now on the arrow 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:26.930
 click back then pushes that 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:28.990
 electric sun roll completely 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:28.990
 behind 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:33.010
 from electric 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.670
 then of course we have one more 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.229
 arrow forward 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.540
 that means we can do the job again 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:44.670
 We can push forward 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:47.330
 tilt the roof on by just 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:51.500
 push this switch up 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:54.060
 Now the roof is only slightly touched 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:56.700
 yes, if we now this rotary switch 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.390
 We can turn the roof completely 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.310
 to open 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:02.399
 the natural different stages like 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:04.979
 Want to open that far the deciding 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:07.140
 ultimately the roof itself is black 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:09.630
 always stand here about and then 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:13.320
 can you come back extra that 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:19.890

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:22.470
 are completely open yes and so looks 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:27.569

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:29.850
 I think it's pretty big yes it does 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:32.150
 of course the car open in something brighter 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:36.750

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:40.069
