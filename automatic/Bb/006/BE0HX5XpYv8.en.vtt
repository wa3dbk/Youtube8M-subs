00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.099
 the systems that are the systems a 

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:08.099
 system definition 

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:15.710
 it's a set of steps I do not like 

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:17.630
 much that definition really the 

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:21.910
 systems are a set of steps that 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:24.710
 repeated give a predictable result 

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:27.740
 the systems are a set of steps or 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:30.940
 actions that repeat give give a 

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:33.940
 predictable result 

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:37.810
 when I start the car it is a system 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:38.950
 because because I put the key the turn is 

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:41.920
 start engine start engine 

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:43.810
 first method stepped on the accelerator and 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:47.230
 start the car if I do the same thing again 

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:50.760
 same thing that happened with the car passes 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:54.790
 to clear that this is a system 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:56.440
 mcdonald's is a mcdonald's system 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:58.980
 a system because it is a system 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:58.980
 mcdonald's 

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:08.530
 by the defined processes because it repeats 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:10.540
 always the same and in the end you get 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:14.530
 the big mac that you put on all the 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:17.020
 sites and that knows virtually the same is 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:19.000
 a good agreement system that we 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:20.979
 contribute the systems that provide us 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.710
 systems and why they are so important 

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:26.020
 the systems that provide us when 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:28.060
 we have defined a system we have the 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:30.409
 ability so that in this case for 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:33.890
 generate 

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:35.689
 ideas of agreement fixes with we are 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:37.670
 talking about the method because the chance 

00:01:35.689 --> 00:01:39.500
 and the ureca method we do not have any 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:41.329
 control over results when we have 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:45.049
 defined a system we get 

00:01:41.329 --> 00:01:47.420
 we get higher productivity 

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:49.039
 productivity if you are entrepreneurs if 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:51.950
 you want to be entrepreneurs you must have 

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:54.289
 a system to generate ideas for 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:58.130
 generate ideas constantly you can there 

00:01:54.289 --> 00:02:00.259
 in the pro systems is that they are 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:02.629
 much more productive have capacity 

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:05.030
 to generate many more ideas of agreement 

00:02:02.629 --> 00:02:06.860
 has a with a contra also of some 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:09.590
 way and is 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:11.870
 that there is less surprise there is less 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:14.720
 surprise you have more productivity but 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:17.420
 logically to apply one more process 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:19.820
 throwing solutions that are or can 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:22.310
 be in some case more similar 

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:25.390
 but finally the big conclusion is 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:29.710
 that the systems help us generate 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:29.710
 many more ideas
