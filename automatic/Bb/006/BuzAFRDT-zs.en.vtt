00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:06.939
 cyberport presents the samsung galaxy 

00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:08.769
 s 6 as is currently one of the 

00:00:06.939 --> 00:00:10.570
 most spectacular smartphones on the 

00:00:08.769 --> 00:00:12.820
 market not only because the display is on 

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:14.500
 both edges is rounded but 

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:15.370
 because it is synonymous with the most modern technology 

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:16.960
 was equipped 

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:19.750
 but these features also have theirs 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:20.890
 price and the s6 on it too 

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:22.840
 a top spot 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:25.390
 whether this flagship is worth its money 

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:28.960
 Let's show you the technical ones 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:31.450
 data first that it is sex edge 14 2 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:34.030
 cm high seven inches wide and 

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:37.360
 seven millimeters deep the smartphone 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:39.790
 weighs 132 grams and offers a 5 1 inch 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:44.770
 Great super amoled display with one 

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:46.600
 resolution of 2560 x 1440 pixels below 

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:50.230
 the glass housing a working 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:53.050
 exynos 74 20 hectares core processor where 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:55.660
 four cores with 2.1 gigahertz and more 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:58.090
 four cores clock with 1 5 gigahertz 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:58.870
 the cpu gets ram of three gigabytes 

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:01.060
 supports 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:05.770
 for data and applications 

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:07.810
 optional 32 64 or 128 gb internal 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:08.950
 Unfortunately, the memory is not available 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:11.290
 can be extended 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:12.850
 naming it for six edge 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:13.570
 the rounded edges on the 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:15.520
 front 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:17.740
 although we already know something similar from no 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:19.270
 touch our tester offers us however 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:21.400
 a round off on both sides 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:23.560
 although this is not so pronounced 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:25.710
 like the no touch, that's the design 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:28.000
 of the sextet currently on the market 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.040
 Unique Samsung has a frame 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.720
 Aluminum is installed as well as the front and 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:32.650
 back of four small glass 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:34.119
 manufacture 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:36.850
 This makes the smartphone one 

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:38.950
 highest and high quality impression 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:40.170
 However, there is one joy too 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:42.090
 other side of the medal 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:44.009
 the rounded edges lead namely 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.110
 to that the respective sides very much 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:47.700
 narrow and therefore less grip 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.409
 because of that you have a rather 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.090
 insecure hold feeling 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:53.159
 maybe this will come after a certain amount 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.750
 but not getting used to us anymore 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:57.649
 give the best grade 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:02:02.190
 The display is with its resolution of 

00:01:57.649 --> 00:02:04.020
 2560 x 1440 pixels ultra sharp lyrics 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:06.570
 and pictures are presented brilliantly 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.550
 Image points are virtually invisible that 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:10.649
 super amoled display convinced by 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:12.900
 very good color contrast and black values 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:15.690
 as far as the brightness is concerned, so are 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:17.760
 Automatic mode up to 600 candela per 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:20.040
 square meter in it too is currently 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:22.290
 absolutely outstanding because the premium 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:24.120
 smartphones currently in the cut at 400 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:25.410
 candela per square meter are thereby 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.720
 the screen stays with itself 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:30.060
 bright sun still very readable 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:32.010
 the built-in eight-core made class 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:34.260
 processor offers us four weaker ones 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:36.660
 Cores for everyday applications as well 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:38.400
 four powerful like maximum 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:40.049
 performance is required the combination 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:42.150
 Works flawlessly 

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:44.310
 all apps and games become very much 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:46.440
 to have executed fluently 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:48.450
 we also flash this to the built-in us 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:50.579
 memory by the access times 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:52.650
 on data were significantly reduced 

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:54.840
 so that it secures the six 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:56.220
 place as currently the fastest android 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:58.200
 smartphone very good 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:00.780
 the operating system is 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:02.370
 android 5.0 point 2 that through the 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:03.780
 latest version of the touchwiz ui 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:05.100
 was modified 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:06.989
 this is the smartphone now 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:08.970
 much slimmer and clearer 

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:11.930
 therefore, as all the previous version we have 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:15.690
 category 6 w lan was also listed 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:17.519
 infrared transmitter bluetooth 4.1 nfc one 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:19.500
 fingerprint scanner a heart rate monitor 

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:22.829
 as well as the possibility of inductive 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:25.739
 also invite points that it sex with a 

00:03:22.829 --> 00:03:26.819
 terrific 16 megapixel camera not only 

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:29.489
 in optimal light conditions 

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:32.489
 thanks to the sextet's camera 

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:34.440
 the maximum open aperture is f 1.9 

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:36.490
 the lens very bright so that 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:38.560
 even in low light situations very much 

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:42.010
 results are achieved and also the 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:43.720
 battery life is promising 2600 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:45.670
 milliHours make for a 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:48.160
 operating time of up to two days 

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:49.870
 despite the powerful hardware is 

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:52.180
 the battery maria she lives in 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:54.130
 few minutes so far on that further 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:56.980
 four hours of operation are possible 

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:58.930
 The 100% battery is in short supply 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:01.060
 two hours high 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:03.070
 Now we have some things together 

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:04.960
 and much praised that at the price 

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:06.640
 but few weaknesses were showing 

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:09.220
 also foreseen but where are there 

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:11.680
 points of criticism and what does the s6 stand for? 

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:13.630
 from normal s6 actually off the 

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:15.670
 single points of criticism concern this 

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:17.620
 basic design concept due 

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:18.970
 Its construction can be compared to the 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:20.680
 predecessors of the battery no longer 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:22.750
 There are also changes 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:25.840
 no slot for a micro sd card in the 

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:28.120
 Compared to s 5, the s6 and s6 have 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:28.870
 Edge also lost its water resistance 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:31.210
 what a shame 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:33.550
 Compared to the s 6, there is except for the 

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:34.900
 design no basic differences 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:36.850
 the hardware is the same and also 

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:39.400
 features like fingerprint scanner and 

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:41.410
 Heart rate monitors are available in the s6 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:43.420
 difference is only visible in detail 

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:45.610
 so the rounded one knew 

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:47.530
 Quick access for contacts or apps 

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:49.450
 and shows when the display is off 

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:51.790
 time of day and the alarm clock status on 

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:53.680
 put it that sex with the display on 

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:55.690
 the table lights up laterally when 

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:57.910
 A message has arrived that it 

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:59.710
 Of course, sex can not do that 

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:02.230
 extras are enough for the 

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:03.340
 more expensive s6 edge is to decide 

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:05.680
 quite questionable 

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:07.240
 The fact, however, is that it's sex age 

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:09.880
 extraordinary product without 

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:11.560
 Significant brand indicates battery and 

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:12.340
 micro sd is not approaching him 

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:14.260
 but hey 

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:16.050
 So the hexagon is in good shape 

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:18.349
 flagship society 

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:20.129
 it actually invests every euro well 

00:05:18.349 --> 00:05:24.270
 if you have the necessary change 

00:05:20.129 --> 00:05:27.500
 bring along we deserve 5 out of 5 

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:27.500
 his stars
