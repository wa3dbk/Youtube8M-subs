00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.850
 hi people thanks for turning on 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:08.099
 smartphones are changing them 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:09.929
 getting bigger and bigger high resolution 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:11.880
 cameras better speakers and 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:13.710
 higher quality designed then possibly 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.619
 are still waterproof 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:18.480
 why the whole thing is easy 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.220
 to differ from the competition 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.900
 and the attention with special 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.029
 features attract those 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.830
 usual equipment like processors 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:27.689
 main memory or internal memory 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.060
 are getting closer and closer to ours 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.800
 partly already identical one needs 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.170
 as a manufacturer so special features around 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.450
 to attract a potential customer 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.820
 The displays have us at the current 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.230
 competition already looked at the cameras 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.190
 still follow and now is the 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.690
 loudspeaker on it 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.700
 and there are also different ones 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:48.239
 their effects we start now 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:50.070
 want to look at htc is at vonn m 8 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.320
 on two stereo front speakers with 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.449
 integrated amplifier and also sony 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.000
 puts on stereo speakers at the 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:59.129
 front mounted if you ask me 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.739
 by the way, the optimal solution 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:04.229
 lg puts the speaker on the g3 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.729
 the back gives him 1 watt and 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:07.799
 a bass amplifier but one 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.510
 lot of booms with i am going to be the 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.979
 start music and then we educate ourselves 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.930
 all have their own opinion 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:15.950
 Let's see which manufacturer it is 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.950
 best power 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:31.560
 the 

00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:08.420
 O 

00:06:13.719 --> 00:06:21.379
 so and what want to conclude from this 

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:23.089
 video so the lg 3 has the loudest 

00:06:21.379 --> 00:06:24.830
 loudspeakers, however, are missing here 

00:06:23.089 --> 00:06:27.830
 a little bit the better and really that way 

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:29.629
 deep in the songs that htc 

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:31.639
 has the best overall 

00:06:29.629 --> 00:06:33.830
 speakers are really nice 

00:06:31.639 --> 00:06:36.589
 adequate volume and orderly 

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:38.629
 bass behind it under sony xperia two das 

00:06:36.589 --> 00:06:41.509
 is just a balanced mixture 

00:06:38.629 --> 00:06:44.389
 what is there proper volume 

00:06:41.509 --> 00:06:49.099
 perfectly okay is probably somewhere in 

00:06:44.389 --> 00:06:51.020
 the middle between r gt3 and does all 

00:06:49.099 --> 00:06:53.569
 Speakers for themselves are completely in 

00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:55.879
 order and significantly better than at 

00:06:53.569 --> 00:06:57.620
 other competitors decide themselves 

00:06:55.879 --> 00:06:59.360
 what you liked the most 

00:06:57.620 --> 00:07:00.919
 and that should be synonymous with this 

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:03.319
 have been video 

00:07:00.919 --> 00:07:04.639
 if you have another one 

00:07:03.319 --> 00:07:06.709
 I'm still interested in comparison 

00:07:04.639 --> 00:07:08.330
 made a benchmark comparison 

00:07:06.709 --> 00:07:09.080
 Of course you can do it yourself 

00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:11.089
 look at 

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:14.770
 that 's it with this video many thanks 

00:07:11.089 --> 00:07:14.770
 for your time it's good
