00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:07.400
 welcome to the training series at 

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.530
 animation software meaning studio 

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:11.660
 in this lesson you will discover 

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:14.900
 the interface and the basic concepts of 

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:15.199
 mean then let's start during this 

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:16.550
 short 

00:00:15.199 --> 00:00:18.320
 I will work with the interface 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:19.940
 English of which you could find 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:21.230
 it would be more practical to go 

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:23.660
 also an English interface during 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:25.520
 that you will follow relief is easy 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:27.640
 choose preference in the menu 

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:27.640
 edition 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:36.220
 then go to the miscellaneous tab and 

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:36.220
 choose english from the list 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:47.970
 after that you will have to 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:50.940
 start the application now let's 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:52.379
 to the main elements of the interface 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.850
 it may happen that your installation 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:56.129
 physical signs are configured 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.140
 differently to restore the 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:00.000
 default presentation choose 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.420
 windows 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.109
 space 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:05.109
 default 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:11.830
 so what is the window 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:14.970
 main in the center of the screen we 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:16.920
 have the main work surface 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.750
 on top of it you can find the 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.120
 buttons to save open a 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:24.780
 file do or redo the last 

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:27.110
 action and so on left 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.940
 we have the toolbox 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:31.070
 and some global tool settings 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:34.460
 such as filling colors and 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:36.440
 borders and line width 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:38.240
 there are additional panels in 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:38.630
 below and to the right of the surface of 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:40.580
 job 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:42.440
 I do not go all is described in detail 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:45.050
 my chips just a look at the most 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:46.780
 important of them 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:52.090
 option of tools 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:53.640
 calq and parameters let's see how he 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:56.380
 works 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:58.270
 choose the circle tool in the box 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:00.009
 tools 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:01.750
 the circle tool options have 

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:04.479
 now appeared whose panel 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:06.340
 options tools make sure that the 

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:08.319
 button create a few circles is 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:10.989
 activated and that all other buttons 

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:12.910
 this row are disabled next 

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:15.220
 placed the mouse somewhere in the 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:17.290
 pressed work surface and hold 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:18.909
 the left mouse button 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:20.620
 now pull the mouse until 

00:02:18.909 --> 00:02:22.959
 that you have a circle and release the 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:25.360
 button that's it you have a deer that 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:27.460
 looks like this 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:29.010
 note that a new layer has appeared 

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:32.020
 in the layers of panel 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:34.890
 that's how each name object means that 

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:37.080
 studio is a separate layer 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:40.670
 choose a different color and 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:40.670
 pencil a circle over 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:54.760
 the second circle has also appeared 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:58.829
 whose layer panel is passing 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:58.829
 now to the transformation tool 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:03.870
 you can select objects in 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:05.700
 using either the kalck panel or 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:07.680
 the work surface when an object 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:09.330
 selected you can change these 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:09.750
 parameters one pulls one knows points 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:14.120
 colorful 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:14.120
 these points are called wrists 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:19.770
 but usually the objects have 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:23.780
 many other parameters you can 

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:23.780
 exchanged in the settings panel 

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:30.290
 we have here alpha male and color 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:32.420
 Feb and many others the interface is in 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:35.770
 English in this video to edit a 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:38.960
 parameter double-click on its value 

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:42.430
 make some changes 

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:42.430
 and near his entrance 

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:52.819
 in the layers panel we can 

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:52.819
 change the order of the layers 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:58.990
 here we can duplicate them and 

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:01.750
 to take off 

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:03.640
 copy them to the clipboard and 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:07.210
 so on for example 

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:10.300
 let's make a copy of this circle pressed this 

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:12.540
 button and now we have one 

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:12.540
 copy
