four basic elements water fire air and

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.030 
four basic elements water fire air and
soil<00:00:37.590> and<00:00:38.090> from<00:00:39.090> there<00:00:39.360> you<00:00:39.629> can<00:00:39.660> combine<00:00:40.440> to

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
soil and from there you can combine to

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.250 
soil and from there you can combine to
form<00:00:41.329> everything<00:00:42.329> else<00:00:42.510> from<00:00:42.840> you<00:00:43.140> know

alcohol<00:00:43.829> to<00:00:44.190> life<00:00:44.430> itself<00:00:44.960> so<00:00:45.960> to<00:00:46.559> do<00:00:46.680> this<00:00:47.030> you

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
alcohol to life itself so to do this you

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.250 
alcohol to life itself so to do this you
just<00:00:48.270> tap<00:00:48.510> the<00:00:48.539> element<00:00:49.230> and<00:00:49.410> it<00:00:50.309> goes<00:00:50.820> to<00:00:51.090> the

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:51.260 
just tap the element and it goes to the

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.860 
just tap the element and it goes to the
work<00:00:52.260> table<00:00:52.469> basically<00:00:53.390> however<00:00:54.390> elements

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
work table basically however elements

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.389 
work table basically however elements
however<00:00:55.140> many<00:00:55.440> elements<00:00:55.770> you<00:00:55.949> want<00:00:56.129> and<00:00:56.309> to

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
however many elements you want and to

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:57.770 
however many elements you want and to
combine<00:00:56.730> them<00:00:56.940> you<00:00:57.059> place<00:00:57.270> them<00:00:57.449> on<00:00:57.539> top<00:00:57.570> of

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
combine them you place them on top of

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.459 
combine them you place them on top of
each<00:00:57.989> other<00:00:58.170> and<00:00:59.359> that<00:01:00.359> forms<00:01:00.690> team<00:01:00.930> for

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
each other and that forms team for

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:05.299 
each other and that forms team for
instance<00:01:01.829> but<00:01:03.290> if<00:01:04.290> you<00:01:04.619> have<00:01:04.739> two<00:01:04.920> elements

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
instance but if you have two elements

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.149 
instance but if you have two elements
that<00:01:05.369> don't<00:01:05.640> combine<00:01:06.260> they<00:01:07.260> just<00:01:07.500> stay

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
that don't combine they just stay

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:09.770 
that don't combine they just stay
separate<00:01:08.610> they<00:01:08.790> do<00:01:08.850> not<00:01:09.090> form<00:01:09.330> a<00:01:09.420> new<00:01:09.510> entity

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
separate they do not form a new entity

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.990 
separate they do not form a new entity
and<00:01:10.200> you<00:01:10.710> can<00:01:10.920> continue<00:01:11.340> to<00:01:11.490> go<00:01:11.610> from<00:01:11.850> there

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
and you can continue to go from there

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.630 
and you can continue to go from there
and<00:01:12.240> you<00:01:13.110> can<00:01:13.229> add<00:01:13.409> as<00:01:13.560> many<00:01:13.710> elements<00:01:14.310> as<00:01:14.520> you

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
and you can add as many elements as you

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.300 
and you can add as many elements as you
want<00:01:14.850> to<00:01:15.090> the<00:01:15.270> to<00:01:15.600> the<00:01:15.630> workbench<00:01:16.170> but<00:01:16.619> it<00:01:17.130> does

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
want to the to the workbench but it does

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:18.499 
want to the to the workbench but it does
get<00:01:17.490> kind<00:01:17.759> of<00:01:17.850> cluttered<00:01:18.030> so<00:01:18.210> when<00:01:18.420> that

challenging but I found it to be really
addicting<00:02:15.340> especially<00:02:15.910> as<00:02:16.030> I<00:02:16.150> progress<00:02:16.360> and

addicting especially as I progress and

you<00:02:17.560> know<00:02:17.680> I'm<00:02:17.860> kind<00:02:18.160> of<00:02:18.280> frustrated<00:02:19.090> by

you know I'm kind of frustrated by

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:21.720 
you know I'm kind of frustrated by
things<00:02:19.840> that<00:02:20.110> I<00:02:20.140> want<00:02:20.680> to<00:02:20.740> combine<00:02:20.980> or<00:02:21.459> want<00:02:21.640> to

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730 
things that I want to combine or want to

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:26.370 
things that I want to combine or want to
create<00:02:22.709> but<00:02:23.709> I<00:02:23.950> do<00:02:24.069> find<00:02:24.490> that<00:02:24.880> sometimes<00:02:25.660> it

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:26.380 
create but I do find that sometimes it

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:29.430 
create but I do find that sometimes it
is<00:02:26.650> difficult<00:02:26.680> to<00:02:27.400> combine<00:02:28.300> you<00:02:29.020> know<00:02:29.140> there

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:29.440 
is difficult to combine you know there

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:31.140 
is difficult to combine you know there
are<00:02:29.530> things<00:02:29.560> that<00:02:29.950> logically<00:02:30.580> should<00:02:30.910> combine

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 
are things that logically should combine

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.150 
are things that logically should combine
to<00:02:31.480> form<00:02:31.510> new<00:02:31.750> elements<00:02:32.350> and<00:02:32.560> they<00:02:32.680> don't<00:02:32.860> for

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:33.160 
to form new elements and they don't for

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:35.940 
to form new elements and they don't for
some<00:02:33.310> reason<00:02:33.670> so<00:02:33.880> maybe<00:02:34.140> the<00:02:35.140> developers<00:02:35.680> need

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:35.950 
some reason so maybe the developers need

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:38.100 
some reason so maybe the developers need
to<00:02:36.100> really<00:02:36.430> go<00:02:36.700> through<00:02:36.970> and<00:02:37.390> make<00:02:37.630> sure<00:02:37.660> that

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.110 
to really go through and make sure that

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:39.510 
to really go through and make sure that
they<00:02:38.230> have<00:02:38.380> all<00:02:38.530> their<00:02:38.650> bases<00:02:38.800> covered<00:02:39.220> so

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:39.520 
they have all their bases covered so

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:41.790 
they have all their bases covered so
it's<00:02:39.670> most<00:02:39.910> accurate<00:02:40.330> at<00:02:40.480> possible<00:02:41.050> and<00:02:41.319> also

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:41.800 
it's most accurate at possible and also

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:43.500 
it's most accurate at possible and also
because<00:02:42.310> i<00:02:42.340> have<00:02:42.640> seen<00:02:42.910> the<00:02:43.060> android<00:02:43.450> version

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:43.510 
because i have seen the android version

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:46.170 
because i have seen the android version
and<00:02:44.200> while<00:02:44.410> i<00:02:44.440> do<00:02:44.590> love<00:02:45.010> the<00:02:45.760> old<00:02:45.880> school

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:52.150 
the iphone i do think the android

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:54.170 
the iphone i do think the android
version<00:02:52.180> is<00:02:52.630> cooler<00:02:52.870> has<00:02:53.080> a<00:02:53.140> little<00:02:53.380> bit<00:02:53.530> more

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
version is cooler has a little bit more

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:56.759 
version is cooler has a little bit more
possibilities<00:02:55.180> for<00:02:55.510> creation<00:02:56.080> i've<00:02:56.470> seen<00:02:56.739> a

00:02:56.759 --> 00:02:56.769 
possibilities for creation i've seen a

00:02:56.769 --> 00:02:59.550 
possibilities for creation i've seen a
lot<00:02:56.890> more<00:02:57.340> ways<00:02:58.209> to<00:02:58.239> combine<00:02:58.660> things<00:02:59.110> and

00:02:59.550 --> 00:02:59.560 
lot more ways to combine things and

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:02.790 
lot more ways to combine things and
things<00:03:00.250> you<00:03:00.370> can<00:03:00.550> make<00:03:00.580> with<00:03:00.760> in<00:03:01.569> that<00:03:01.780> so<00:03:02.200> you

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:02.800 
things you can make with in that so you

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:05.070 
things you can make with in that so you
know<00:03:02.920> assuming<00:03:03.910> it's<00:03:04.209> the<00:03:04.269> same<00:03:04.450> developer

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:05.080 
know assuming it's the same developer

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:07.580 
know assuming it's the same developer
they<00:03:05.350> kind<00:03:05.560> of<00:03:05.620> need<00:03:05.769> to<00:03:05.980> sync<00:03:06.370> up<00:03:06.519> the<00:03:06.730> devices

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
they kind of need to sync up the devices

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:10.080 
they kind of need to sync up the devices
but<00:03:08.590> having<00:03:08.860> said<00:03:08.890> that<00:03:09.100> you<00:03:09.310> know<00:03:09.580> i'm<00:03:09.819> still
