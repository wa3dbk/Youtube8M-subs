00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:17.489 
Game five and I said this once and I say

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:18.500 
Game five and I said this once and I say
it<00:03:17.549> again<00:03:17.760> the<00:03:17.940> most<00:03:18.120> irrelevant

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510 
it again the most irrelevant

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:21.319 
it again the most irrelevant
triple-double<00:03:19.320> in<00:03:20.040> probably<00:03:20.850> Finals<00:03:21.269> history

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:21.329 
triple-double in probably Finals history

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:23.180 
triple-double in probably Finals history
or<00:03:21.840> one<00:03:22.110> of<00:03:22.140> his<00:03:22.260> most<00:03:22.829> irrelevant

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:23.190 
or one of his most irrelevant

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:25.009 
or one of his most irrelevant
triple-double<00:03:23.970> and<00:03:24.090> then<00:03:24.390> Game<00:03:24.570> six<00:03:24.870> he

00:03:25.009 --> 00:03:25.019 
triple-double and then Game six he

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:26.509 
triple-double and then Game six he
really<00:03:25.260> didn't<00:03:25.470> do<00:03:25.530> nothing<00:03:25.860> and<00:03:26.220> in<00:03:26.340> all

00:03:26.509 --> 00:03:26.519 
really didn't do nothing and in all

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:28.640 
really didn't do nothing and in all
those<00:03:26.670> fourth<00:03:26.970> quarters<00:03:27.390> he<00:03:27.510> failed<00:03:27.780> he

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:28.650 
those fourth quarters he failed he

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:30.650 
those fourth quarters he failed he
completely<00:03:29.070> failed<00:03:29.430> he<00:03:29.700> shut<00:03:29.940> he<00:03:30.360> shut<00:03:30.630> it

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:30.660 
completely failed he shut he shut it

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:32.720 
completely failed he shut he shut it
down<00:03:30.870> he<00:03:31.079> shut<00:03:31.320> it<00:03:31.350> off<00:03:31.590> and<00:03:31.890> LeBron

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:32.730 
down he shut it off and LeBron

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:34.699 
down he shut it off and LeBron
disappoints<00:03:33.390> me<00:03:33.450> so<00:03:33.720> much<00:03:33.959> in<00:03:34.230> so<00:03:34.380> many<00:03:34.500> ways

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:34.709 
disappoints me so much in so many ways

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:36.410 
disappoints me so much in so many ways
and<00:03:34.769> the<00:03:35.010> reason<00:03:35.280> why<00:03:35.370> he's<00:03:35.549> a<00:03:35.579> choker<00:03:35.910> is

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:36.420 
and the reason why he's a choker is

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:38.180 
and the reason why he's a choker is
because<00:03:36.690> how<00:03:36.840> he<00:03:36.900> played<00:03:37.320> in<00:03:37.500> the<00:03:37.860> previous

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:38.190 
because how he played in the previous

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:40.280 
because how he played in the previous
series<00:03:38.489> against<00:03:39.180> Chicago<00:03:39.269> I<00:03:39.780> mean<00:03:40.110> you<00:03:40.170> saw

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:40.290 
series against Chicago I mean you saw

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:42.259 
series against Chicago I mean you saw
what<00:03:40.410> that<00:03:40.440> guy<00:03:40.650> did<00:03:40.709> he<00:03:41.130> he<00:03:41.549> rivaled<00:03:42.000> Michael

00:03:42.259 --> 00:03:42.269 
what that guy did he he rivaled Michael

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:44.210 
what that guy did he he rivaled Michael
Jordan<00:03:42.660> and<00:03:42.810> F<00:03:42.930> and<00:03:43.200> that<00:03:43.380> and<00:03:43.590> that<00:03:43.620> uh

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:44.220 
Jordan and F and that and that uh

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:46.479 
Jordan and F and that and that uh
Eastern<00:03:44.910> Conference<00:03:45.269> Finals<00:03:45.630> he<00:03:45.780> played<00:03:46.110> like

00:03:46.479 --> 00:03:46.489 
Eastern Conference Finals he played like

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:49.910 
Eastern Conference Finals he played like
a<00:03:47.570> man<00:03:48.570> possessed<00:03:48.600> you<00:03:49.470> know<00:03:49.590> and<00:03:49.709> I<00:03:49.769> was

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:49.920 
a man possessed you know and I was

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:51.860 
a man possessed you know and I was
thinking<00:03:49.950> man<00:03:50.459> if<00:03:50.489> he<00:03:50.700> plays<00:03:51.000> like<00:03:51.209> that<00:03:51.269> I

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:51.870 
thinking man if he plays like that I

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:54.140 
thinking man if he plays like that I
mean<00:03:52.530> they're<00:03:52.650> gonna<00:03:52.739> sweep<00:03:53.100> Dallas<00:03:53.519> and<00:03:53.730> the

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:54.150 
mean they're gonna sweep Dallas and the

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:56.390 
mean they're gonna sweep Dallas and the
thing<00:03:54.329> is<00:03:54.500> Miami<00:03:55.500> Heat<00:03:55.769> had<00:03:55.950> the<00:03:56.040> home<00:03:56.190> court

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:56.400 
thing is Miami Heat had the home court

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.970 
thing is Miami Heat had the home court
advantage<00:03:56.930> they<00:03:57.930> had<00:03:58.110> the<00:03:58.230> better<00:03:58.380> team<00:03:58.680> to<00:03:58.829> me

00:03:58.970 --> 00:03:58.980 
advantage they had the better team to me

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:00.650 
advantage they had the better team to me
I<00:03:59.190> think<00:03:59.579> the<00:03:59.670> better<00:03:59.790> team<00:04:00.060> lost<00:04:00.269> the<00:04:00.450> series

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:00.660 
I think the better team lost the series

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:03.080 
I think the better team lost the series
is<00:04:01.079> rare<00:04:01.440> that<00:04:01.470> a<00:04:01.680> seven-game<00:04:02.489> series<00:04:02.730> the

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:03.090 
is rare that a seven-game series the

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:04.729 
is rare that a seven-game series the
better<00:04:03.269> team<00:04:03.510> doesn't<00:04:03.959> win<00:04:03.989> but<00:04:04.320> in<00:04:04.410> this<00:04:04.530> case

00:04:04.729 --> 00:04:04.739 
better team doesn't win but in this case

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:07.370 
better team doesn't win but in this case
even<00:04:05.459> though<00:04:05.610> Dallas<00:04:06.299> probably<00:04:06.630> had<00:04:06.810> from<00:04:07.200> 1

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:07.380 
even though Dallas probably had from 1

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:09.860 
even though Dallas probably had from 1
to<00:04:07.500> 15<00:04:07.860> had<00:04:08.670> a<00:04:08.700> better<00:04:09.000> roster<00:04:09.329> and<00:04:09.690> things

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:09.870 
to 15 had a better roster and things

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:11.509 
to 15 had a better roster and things
like<00:04:09.989> that<00:04:10.049> but<00:04:10.380> there's<00:04:10.560> no<00:04:10.799> way<00:04:11.010> the<00:04:11.190> miami

00:04:11.509 --> 00:04:11.519 
like that but there's no way the miami

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:12.830 
like that but there's no way the miami
heat<00:04:11.640> shield<00:04:11.910> law<00:04:12.000> says<00:04:12.239> series<00:04:12.570> you<00:04:12.660> thought

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:12.840 
heat shield law says series you thought

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:14.660 
heat shield law says series you thought
my<00:04:12.989> game<00:04:13.230> one<00:04:13.500> would<00:04:13.680> I<00:04:13.709> beat<00:04:13.950> him<00:04:14.070> Miami<00:04:14.489> did

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:14.670 
my game one would I beat him Miami did

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:16.759 
my game one would I beat him Miami did
and<00:04:14.880> then<00:04:15.390> game<00:04:15.570> two<00:04:15.810> they<00:04:15.959> had<00:04:16.079> a<00:04:16.109> 15-point

00:04:16.759 --> 00:04:16.769 
and then game two they had a 15-point

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:18.860 
and then game two they had a 15-point
lead<00:04:16.829> and<00:04:17.130> blew<00:04:17.190> it<00:04:17.250> and<00:04:17.600> then<00:04:18.600> Game<00:04:18.840> three

they came back and won and then they

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:23.630 
they came back and won and then they
lost<00:04:20.549> the<00:04:20.729> next<00:04:21.000> three<00:04:21.269> games<00:04:21.299> in<00:04:21.810> a<00:04:22.200> row<00:04:22.229> in<00:04:22.640> in
