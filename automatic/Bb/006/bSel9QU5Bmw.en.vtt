here<00:00:02.150> it<00:00:02.270> is<00:00:02.389> back<00:00:03.350> on<00:00:03.590> the<00:00:03.680> ground<00:00:04.149> wheels

00:00:05.139 --> 00:00:05.149 
here it is back on the ground wheels

00:00:05.149 --> 00:00:32.890 
here it is back on the ground wheels
installed

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:32.900 

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:34.630 

probably<00:00:33.560> the<00:00:33.650> cleanest<00:00:34.070> these<00:00:34.220> wheels<00:00:34.490> will

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:34.640 
probably the cleanest these wheels will

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:48.740 
probably the cleanest these wheels will
ever<00:00:34.880> be

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.390 

I<00:00:48.780> think<00:00:49.230> the<00:00:49.350> front<00:00:49.560> end<00:00:49.740> still<00:00:49.950> settling

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:50.400 
I think the front end still settling

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:54.140 
I think the front end still settling
down<00:00:50.550> from<00:00:50.880> being<00:00:51.090> jacked<00:00:51.750> out<00:00:52.820> either<00:00:53.820> way<00:00:54.120> I

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:54.150 
down from being jacked out either way I

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:58.340 
down from being jacked out either way I
got<00:00:54.450> new<00:00:54.630> Springs<00:00:55.320> and<00:00:55.590> full<00:00:56.550> suspension<00:00:57.350> so

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
got new Springs and full suspension so

00:00:58.350 --> 00:00:59.330 
got new Springs and full suspension so
I'm<00:00:58.440> going<00:00:58.590> to<00:00:58.620> lower<00:00:58.800> the<00:00:58.980> front<00:00:59.190> a<00:00:59.250> little

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
I'm going to lower the front a little

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.710 
I'm going to lower the front a little
bit<00:01:01.100> the<00:01:02.100> back<00:01:02.310> can<00:01:02.550> be<00:01:02.640> lowered<00:01:02.880> an<00:01:03.210> inch<00:01:03.570> from

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:03.720 
bit the back can be lowered an inch from

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:08.030 
bit the back can be lowered an inch from
stock<00:01:04.339> but<00:01:05.339> the<00:01:05.820> way<00:01:05.910> the<00:01:06.890> current<00:01:07.890> leaf

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
stock but the way the current leaf

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.120 
stock but the way the current leaf
springs<00:01:08.370> are<00:01:08.550> -<00:01:09.300> probably<00:01:09.540> sagging<00:01:10.050> about<00:01:10.860> an

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
springs are - probably sagging about an

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:17.270 
springs are - probably sagging about an
inch<00:01:11.310> or<00:01:11.460> more<00:01:11.490> in<00:01:12.620> stock<00:01:13.620> so<00:01:16.070> here's<00:01:17.070> what<00:01:17.190> it

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
inch or more in stock so here's what it

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:18.380 
inch or more in stock so here's what it
looks<00:01:17.430> like<00:01:17.550> with<00:01:17.729> new<00:01:17.850> wheels

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
looks like with new wheels

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:25.010 
looks like with new wheels
a<00:01:18.710> lot<00:01:19.710> better<00:01:19.979> a<00:01:20.250> lot<00:01:20.670> nicer

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:50.940 

these<00:01:25.469> are<00:01:25.680> the<00:01:25.770> old<00:01:25.920> wheels<00:01:26.219> and<00:01:26.909> tires

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:50.950 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:56.940 

looks<00:01:51.190> pretty<00:01:51.460> good

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:56.950 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:00.420 

more<00:01:57.490> aggressive<00:01:58.000> in<00:01:58.120> the<00:01:58.210> back<00:01:59.040> wider<00:02:00.040> than

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:00.430 
more aggressive in the back wider than

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:04.850 
more aggressive in the back wider than
was<00:02:00.670> before

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.350 

into<00:02:05.400> 15

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:07.360 
into 15

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:09.899 
into 15
and

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:09.909 
and

00:02:09.909 --> 00:02:12.509 
and
looks<00:02:10.450> like<00:02:10.599> any<00:02:10.750> wider<00:02:11.049> and<00:02:11.409> any<00:02:11.709> lower<00:02:12.010> no

00:02:12.509 --> 00:02:12.519 
looks like any wider and any lower no

00:02:12.519 --> 00:02:15.869 
looks like any wider and any lower no
rub<00:02:13.200> but<00:02:14.200> keep<00:02:14.769> this<00:02:14.920> set<00:02:15.129> up<00:02:15.280> we<00:02:15.489> should<00:02:15.790> be

00:02:15.869 --> 00:02:15.879 
rub but keep this set up we should be

00:02:15.879 --> 00:02:25.760 
rub but keep this set up we should be
good

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:25.770 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:27.470 

okay<00:02:26.280> that's<00:02:26.460> about<00:02:26.550> it<00:02:26.670> it's<00:02:27.150> going<00:02:27.270> to<00:02:27.360> wrap

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
okay that's about it it's going to wrap

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.210 
okay that's about it it's going to wrap
it<00:02:27.510> up<00:02:27.690> for<00:02:27.900> now

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220
