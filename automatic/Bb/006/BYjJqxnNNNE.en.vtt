00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.350

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.940
 Vasya is not spinning 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:39.320

 I decide to go immediately on the 7 8 line because 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.969
 I think this is very important 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:53.390
 direction and no less important than it should 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:56.520
 to worry more important 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:59.039
 standing here right away as mickey 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:01.859
 I aim this passage there very often 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:04.110
 the enemies leave and immediately to 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:07.909
 shoot off and drive over the fence but 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:11.570

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:28.220
 I am lit up here I see that there is art 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:29.420
 she is already aiming at me quickly and 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:33.440
 aiming gives mind 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:36.410
 punch and look while bye look 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:38.990
 just on the sides I appreciate the situation we he 

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:40.490
 gives say the first city from 1 to 5 lines 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:43.040
 which means that we are fast here 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:46.310
 now due to reset to us 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:47.420

 parted one by one is the wind now 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:58.640
 they will be just a focus to destroy 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:02:01.070
 These enemy squared c3 already 4 points 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:04.400

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:11.570
 charged spent 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:12.709

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:31.820
 actually paid for it by 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:33.830

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:39.050
 103 girlfriends repulsed what we did for her 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:41.000

 I have to, and Mike pastrans sledges again 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:53.560
 I look in memory minimap as you see on 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:57.500
 again b5 enemy st-shki already squeeze 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:59.150

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:00.710
 on roll out this notice quickly 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:05.170
 I turn around the case 

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:08.930
 I knock out and unfold again but also the stage 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:10.940
 now here's 58 go from art louis such 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:14.560

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:17.060
 brackets I'm going to st-1 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:18.550
 I see on the school minimap for this all 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:21.740
 do faster 

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:24.230
 give damage through the rink roll back see 

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:27.530
 what's behind us is looking 212 quickly giving 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:30.220
 gas then like u and 4 armor back and on 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:33.740
 the sides don't really say so big and 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:35.630
 it is possible that he wants to see that I 

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:38.600
 stendin was not a fool vytselivat 

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:40.610
 lower armor sheet you shooting back I 

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:43.370
 I'll start and get close to him so that he 

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:46.340
 do not give them as much as possible 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:48.260
 shoot themselves in the lower broneliste here 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:51.260
 here I wanted to pick him up somehow for 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:53.930
 to hurt well, I understand that I would not take 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:57.130
 you roll back to the bottom or sheet it 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:04:00.250
 ricochet wine hurried 

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:03.420
 and drag again yours from 8 see what 

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:06.400
 then busy him in the stern for the stern 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:07.240
 walks in to the garden four go to 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:12.120
 interception a.yu. 

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:15.670
 I'm lucky here because I'm taking 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:18.730
 almost our percent off a bad start 

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:21.280
 record four certainly not sounded 

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:24.060
 so much there are 4 there were 1013 dad and me 

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:26.470
 I take her shooter, I was very lucky and 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:29.350
 actually, as you can see, I charge the house 

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:32.590
 to keep as close as 68 because 

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:35.140
 as under the buckles against 4 p 

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:37.120
 stick together all so good with us 

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:40.090
 one-time alarm but a shot is only one 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:41.770
 recharge long and together we 

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:43.990
 present a big say so 

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:47.770
 crashed too than the bath then 

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:51.040
 one we just get bitten right here yes 

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:54.190
 they look at our papers 2 and I will take 

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:57.760
 I look at 62 more precisely for his nonsense 68 

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:58.780
 I see that everything is fine there is not worth it 

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:01.030
 began to unfold 

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:04.500
 wanted to pick up a top four on see here 

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:08.290
 baht quickly give lawn smears in my 

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:15.640
 Commander at the pen I take him 

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:18.220
 and it remains 50 four and e50 54 here I 

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:19.870
 I think how to take in pset8 take 

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:22.480
 see in without a tower is very difficult he 

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:24.490
 misses I actually roll out 

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:27.700
 do you think it is now v-shot t-54 

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:30.970
 but I'm not lucky I pass below 

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:36.850
 the average damage 54 remains 13 kpc and that 

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:40.120
 the most offensive he does not stand bacon now 

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:42.850
 I will write down 68 that I am without a backup so that he 

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:44.950
 I realized that now I will not charge 

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:45.760
 17 wormwood or 18 seconds 

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:50.410
 oh already a little 

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:52.900
 two times longer to make a decision I see 

00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:54.820
 that at the cost of 8 costs just goes thousands 

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:58.120
 four hold on the gun let's say I 

00:05:54.820 --> 00:06:00.490
 lived on the other hand but 54 can be seen 

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:05.160
 saw me from or just started to climb 

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:10.000
 or kill 68 and as you see with me 

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:12.490
 8215 damage five frags in 68 6 frags and 

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:17.410
 as I recall at the end in this about 

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:20.080
 3000 freak making it turns out now 

00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:22.920

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:25.840
 honeycomb and to here I could not move 

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:26.320
 logs what surrender they turned out to be 

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:29.560
 strong 

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:32.820
 I will say so inaccessible from the first 

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:35.800

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:40.360
 speeds but 68 

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:43.060
 managed to turn around about and geiba and 

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:45.970
 skills gave vent to sex but here is not the case and a 

00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:47.410
 chased the soldiers like a dog we could 

00:06:45.970 --> 00:06:51.190
 somehow drag the fight we somehow

 city ​​maps paired with another powder 

00:07:02.590 --> 00:07:06.600
 they can just terrify because 

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:09.280
 that they have very good one-time damage and 

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:10.300
