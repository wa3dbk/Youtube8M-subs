the microphone of DSLR so dodgy

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:26.360 
the microphone of DSLR so dodgy
technically<00:02:23.980> why<00:02:24.910> is<00:02:24.970> that

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
technically why is that

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:28.580 
technically why is that
assume<00:02:26.670> DSLRs<00:02:27.540> are<00:02:27.659> simply<00:02:28.019> not<00:02:28.140> made<00:02:28.379> for

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
assume DSLRs are simply not made for

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:31.009 
assume DSLRs are simply not made for
this<00:02:28.739> so<00:02:29.190> the<00:02:29.370> microphone<00:02:29.670> came<00:02:30.480> in<00:02:30.659> at<00:02:30.780> a<00:02:30.810> very

00:02:31.009 --> 00:02:31.019 
this so the microphone came in at a very

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:33.050 
this so the microphone came in at a very
late<00:02:31.200> point<00:02:31.500> in<00:02:31.620> time<00:02:31.830> housing<00:02:32.760> is<00:02:32.879> not

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
late point in time housing is not

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:37.100 
late point in time housing is not
dedicated<00:02:33.299> and<00:02:34.489> the<00:02:35.489> electronics<00:02:36.120> is<00:02:36.390> packed

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
dedicated and the electronics is packed

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:39.890 
dedicated and the electronics is packed
with<00:02:37.379> in<00:02:37.620> a<00:02:37.709> housing<00:02:37.920> of<00:02:38.220> a<00:02:38.310> DSLR<00:02:38.940> so<00:02:39.360> this

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
with in a housing of a DSLR so this

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.140 
with in a housing of a DSLR so this
microphone<00:02:40.680> has<00:02:40.920> a<00:02:40.950> very<00:02:41.190> tough<00:02:41.400> life<00:02:41.670> inside

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
microphone has a very tough life inside

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.479 
microphone has a very tough life inside
sit<00:02:42.360> in<00:02:42.450> small<00:02:42.720> housing<00:02:43.140> and<00:02:43.409> why<00:02:44.220> does<00:02:44.459> a

00:02:44.479 --> 00:02:44.489 
sit in small housing and why does a

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:46.819 
sit in small housing and why does a
small<00:02:44.879> housing<00:02:45.299> affect<00:02:45.659> the<00:02:46.110> quality<00:02:46.349> of<00:02:46.650> the

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:46.829 
small housing affect the quality of the

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:49.130 
small housing affect the quality of the
sound<00:02:47.150> well<00:02:48.150> the<00:02:48.239> first<00:02:48.480> thing<00:02:48.629> that<00:02:48.810> comes<00:02:48.989> in

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
sound well the first thing that comes in

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:51.289 
sound well the first thing that comes in
mind<00:02:49.290> there<00:02:49.560> is<00:02:49.680> no<00:02:49.860> space<00:02:50.159> for<00:02:50.519> a<00:02:50.730> shock<00:02:51.030> mount

00:02:51.289 --> 00:02:51.299 
mind there is no space for a shock mount

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:53.690 
mind there is no space for a shock mount
or<00:02:51.569> any<00:02:52.200> proper<00:02:52.980> positioning<00:02:53.430> of<00:02:53.610> the

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
or any proper positioning of the

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:56.180 
or any proper positioning of the
microphone<00:02:54.180> but<00:02:54.900> also<00:02:55.110> I<00:02:55.349> would<00:02:55.769> assume<00:02:56.099> that

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
microphone but also I would assume that

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:58.670 
microphone but also I would assume that
with<00:02:56.790> all<00:02:57.180> the<00:02:57.450> electronics<00:02:57.810> and<00:02:58.140> the<00:02:58.230> digital

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
with all the electronics and the digital

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.470 
with all the electronics and the digital
stuff<00:02:58.950> that's<00:02:59.160> going<00:02:59.400> on<00:02:59.519> inside<00:02:59.730> such<00:03:00.450> a

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
stuff that's going on inside such a

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.869 
stuff that's going on inside such a
small<00:03:00.810> housing<00:03:01.319> there's<00:03:02.280> a<00:03:02.340> good<00:03:02.489> chance<00:03:02.730> of

00:03:02.869 --> 00:03:02.879 
small housing there's a good chance of

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:06.009 
small housing there's a good chance of
interference<00:03:03.450> to<00:03:03.660> the<00:03:03.780> microphone<00:03:04.489> so

00:03:06.009 --> 00:03:06.019 
interference to the microphone so

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:08.119 
interference to the microphone so
whenever<00:03:07.019> you<00:03:07.290> have<00:03:07.379> a<00:03:07.440> chance<00:03:07.739> to<00:03:07.829> get<00:03:08.040> the

00:03:08.119 --> 00:03:08.129 
whenever you have a chance to get the

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:10.490 
whenever you have a chance to get the
microphone<00:03:08.549> out<00:03:08.730> of<00:03:09.060> the<00:03:09.150> camera<00:03:09.510> I<00:03:09.780> would

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
microphone out of the camera I would

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:13.520 
microphone out of the camera I would
think<00:03:10.680> that's<00:03:10.829> the<00:03:10.950> best<00:03:11.159> way<00:03:11.670> to<00:03:11.700> go<00:03:12.109> right<00:03:13.109> is

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530 
think that's the best way to go right is

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:15.440 
think that's the best way to go right is
that<00:03:13.560> what<00:03:13.859> you<00:03:14.040> do<00:03:14.220> Mike<00:03:14.430> to<00:03:14.730> get<00:03:14.909> the<00:03:15.030> mic<00:03:15.239> out

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:15.450 
that what you do Mike to get the mic out

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:17.420 
that what you do Mike to get the mic out
of<00:03:15.720> the<00:03:15.840> camera<00:03:16.260> yes<00:03:16.650> that's<00:03:16.859> exactly<00:03:16.950> what<00:03:17.400> I

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 
of the camera yes that's exactly what I

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:20.690 
of the camera yes that's exactly what I
do<00:03:17.549> I<00:03:17.849> use<00:03:18.659> an<00:03:18.810> external<00:03:19.109> recording<00:03:20.010> device

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700 
do I use an external recording device

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:23.360 
do I use an external recording device
like<00:03:21.060> this<00:03:21.319> zoom<00:03:22.319> h4n<00:03:22.859> which<00:03:23.129> I'm<00:03:23.250> actually

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 
like this zoom h4n which I'm actually

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:26.149 
like this zoom h4n which I'm actually
recording<00:03:23.609> my<00:03:24.060> audio<00:03:24.090> on<00:03:24.450> right<00:03:24.720> now<00:03:24.980> you<00:03:25.980> can

00:03:26.149 --> 00:03:26.159 
recording my audio on right now you can

00:03:26.159 --> 00:03:28.550 
recording my audio on right now you can
plug<00:03:26.340> anything<00:03:26.640> into<00:03:26.970> this<00:03:27.209> device<00:03:28.200> you<00:03:28.409> can

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560 
plug anything into this device you can

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.949 
plug anything into this device you can
plug<00:03:28.799> shotgun<00:03:29.419> radio<00:03:30.419> marks<00:03:30.630> whatever<00:03:30.870> you

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:30.959 
plug shotgun radio marks whatever you

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:31.309 
plug shotgun radio marks whatever you
want

00:03:31.309 --> 00:03:31.319 
want

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:35.000 
want
it<00:03:32.160> records<00:03:32.700> good<00:03:33.030> quality<00:03:33.450> sound<00:03:33.859> which<00:03:34.859> I

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010 
it records good quality sound which I

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:37.490 
it records good quality sound which I
then<00:03:35.160> bring<00:03:35.970> into<00:03:36.239> the<00:03:36.359> Edit<00:03:36.599> and<00:03:36.840> sync<00:03:37.290> up

then bring into the Edit and sync up

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:40.159 
then bring into the Edit and sync up
later<00:03:38.040> right<00:03:38.430> so<00:03:39.180> you<00:03:39.239> still<00:03:39.540> use<00:03:39.750> the<00:03:39.930> dodgy

00:03:40.159 --> 00:03:40.169 
later right so you still use the dodgy

00:03:40.169 --> 00:03:44.050 
later right so you still use the dodgy
sound<00:03:40.590> of<00:03:40.739> the<00:03:40.799> DSLR<00:03:41.250> to<00:03:41.489> just<00:03:41.940> to<00:03:42.150> sync<00:03:42.359> with

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:53.540 
it's already synced and now I'm ready to

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:56.650 
it's already synced and now I'm ready to
edit<00:04:54.050> right<00:04:54.380> and<00:04:55.250> you<00:04:55.790> have<00:04:55.940> to<00:04:56.090> now<00:04:56.240> delete

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:56.660 
edit right and you have to now delete

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:58.450 
edit right and you have to now delete
the<00:04:56.840> dodgy<00:04:57.050> sound<00:04:57.440> out<00:04:57.650> of<00:04:57.680> your<00:04:57.830> sequencer

00:04:58.450 --> 00:04:58.460 
the dodgy sound out of your sequencer

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:00.190 
the dodgy sound out of your sequencer
you<00:04:58.550> leave<00:04:58.880> it<00:04:59.030> well<00:04:59.210> actually<00:04:59.480> it<00:04:59.900> will

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:00.200 
you leave it well actually it will

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:03.010 
you leave it well actually it will
create<00:05:00.710> a<00:05:00.800> new<00:05:01.160> sequence<00:05:01.580> for<00:05:01.850> you<00:05:02.060> with<00:05:02.660> the

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:03.020 
create a new sequence for you with the

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:06.600 
create a new sequence for you with the
good<00:05:03.440> audio<00:05:04.010> attached<00:05:04.490> to<00:05:04.850> the<00:05:05.320> DSLR<00:05:06.320> footage

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:06.610 
good audio attached to the DSLR footage

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:10.660 
good audio attached to the DSLR footage
so<00:05:07.610> the<00:05:07.940> dodgy<00:05:08.390> sound<00:05:08.870> level<00:05:09.710> is<00:05:09.920> still<00:05:10.340> very

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:10.670 
so the dodgy sound level is still very

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:12.640 
so the dodgy sound level is still very
important<00:05:11.210> absolutely<00:05:11.930> the<00:05:12.050> better<00:05:12.260> the

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:12.650 
important absolutely the better the

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:14.260 
important absolutely the better the
dodgy<00:05:12.980> audio<00:05:13.370> have<00:05:13.670> the<00:05:13.790> easier<00:05:14.030> it<00:05:14.120> is<00:05:14.210> to

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:14.270 
dodgy audio have the easier it is to

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:16.690 
dodgy audio have the easier it is to
sync<00:05:14.600> up<00:05:14.720> in<00:05:14.900> the<00:05:14.990> Edit<00:05:15.230> okay<00:05:15.830> so<00:05:15.890> the<00:05:16.310> key<00:05:16.520> is

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:16.700 
sync up in the Edit okay so the key is

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:18.940 
sync up in the Edit okay so the key is
to<00:05:16.970> get<00:05:17.150> a<00:05:17.210> good<00:05:17.570> external<00:05:18.200> microphone<00:05:18.740> for

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:18.950 
to get a good external microphone for

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:21.280 
to get a good external microphone for
the<00:05:19.040> DSLR<00:05:19.580> it's<00:05:19.850> still<00:05:20.300> flexible<00:05:20.570> and<00:05:20.990> doesn't

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:21.290 
the DSLR it's still flexible and doesn't

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:26.380 
the DSLR it's still flexible and doesn't
show<00:05:21.500> up<00:05:21.710> in<00:05:21.950> your<00:05:22.550> image<00:05:25.090> well<00:05:26.090> we<00:05:26.270> have

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:26.390 
show up in your image well we have

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:29.350 
show up in your image well we have
created<00:05:26.960> a<00:05:27.140> very<00:05:27.470> clever<00:05:27.800> microphone<00:05:28.360> which

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:29.360 
created a very clever microphone which

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:32.530 
created a very clever microphone which
is<00:05:29.770> very<00:05:30.770> small<00:05:31.220> so<00:05:31.520> if<00:05:31.670> you're<00:05:31.820> running<00:05:32.330> a

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:32.540 
is very small so if you're running a

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:34.060 
is very small so if you're running a
short<00:05:32.810> lens<00:05:32.990> it<00:05:33.380> will<00:05:33.530> not<00:05:33.650> show<00:05:33.770> up<00:05:33.800> at<00:05:34.010> the

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:34.070 
short lens it will not show up at the

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:37.680 
short lens it will not show up at the
viewfinder<00:05:34.690> this<00:05:35.690> way<00:05:35.900> at<00:05:35.990> the<00:05:36.140> M<00:05:36.260> key<00:05:36.410> 400<00:05:36.950> and

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:37.690 
viewfinder this way at the M key 400 and

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:40.270 
viewfinder this way at the M key 400 and
so<00:05:38.690> with<00:05:38.900> a<00:05:38.930> traditional<00:05:39.530> microphone<00:05:40.040> you

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:40.280 
so with a traditional microphone you

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:43.870 
so with a traditional microphone you
have<00:05:40.460> the<00:05:40.700> interference<00:05:41.270> cube<00:05:41.570> the<00:05:42.230> capsu<00:05:42.880> the

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:43.880 
have the interference cube the capsu the

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:47.140 
have the interference cube the capsu the
electronics<00:05:44.600> and<00:05:44.950> the<00:05:45.950> XLR<00:05:46.400> connector<00:05:46.880> and

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:47.150 
electronics and the XLR connector and

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:50.560 
electronics and the XLR connector and
now<00:05:47.870> with<00:05:48.110> the<00:05:48.230> mku<00:05:48.590> 400<00:05:49.190> you<00:05:49.880> still<00:05:50.120> have<00:05:50.360> the

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:50.570 
now with the mku 400 you still have the

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:53.830 
now with the mku 400 you still have the
interference<00:05:51.110> tube<00:05:51.580> you<00:05:52.580> have<00:05:52.610> the<00:05:53.030> electric

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:53.840 
interference tube you have the electric

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:56.380 
interference tube you have the electric
capsule<00:05:54.290> but<00:05:54.800> the<00:05:54.950> electronics<00:05:55.610> is<00:05:55.850> folded

00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:56.390 
capsule but the electronics is folded

00:05:56.390 --> 00:05:58.060 
capsule but the electronics is folded
underneath<00:05:56.870> the<00:05:57.350> capsule<00:05:57.800> and<00:05:58.010> the

00:05:58.060 --> 00:05:58.070

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:00.710 
interference tube and the connector it's

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:03.370 
interference tube and the connector it's
on<00:06:01.460> the<00:06:01.730> back<00:06:01.910> and<00:06:02.120> it's<00:06:02.270> not<00:06:02.450> XLR<00:06:02.960> but<00:06:03.140> it's<00:06:03.290> a

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:03.380 
on the back and it's not XLR but it's a

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:06.700 
on the back and it's not XLR but it's a
mini<00:06:03.560> Czech<00:06:04.000> class<00:06:05.000> how<00:06:05.210> does<00:06:05.360> the<00:06:05.510> MK<00:06:05.990> 400

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:06.710 
mini Czech class how does the MK 400

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:09.010 
mini Czech class how does the MK 400
compared<00:06:07.580> to<00:06:07.760> the<00:06:07.910> bigger<00:06:08.390> shotgun<00:06:08.810> lights

00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:09.020 
compared to the bigger shotgun lights

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:12.580 
compared to the bigger shotgun lights
like<00:06:09.200> the<00:06:09.350> Mk<00:06:09.620> II<00:06:09.830> 600<00:06:10.610> the<00:06:10.970> small<00:06:11.780> one<00:06:11.990> the<00:06:12.110> 400

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:12.590 
like the Mk II 600 the small one the 400

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:14.760 
like the Mk II 600 the small one the 400
it's<00:06:12.920> very<00:06:13.220> suitable<00:06:13.460> for<00:06:13.880> small<00:06:14.090> cameras

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:14.770 
it's very suitable for small cameras

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:16.870 
it's very suitable for small cameras
while<00:06:15.770> the<00:06:15.890> big<00:06:16.040> one<00:06:16.250> gives<00:06:16.520> us<00:06:16.640> a<00:06:16.730> lot<00:06:16.850> of

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:16.880 
while the big one gives us a lot of

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:19.270 
while the big one gives us a lot of
opportunity<00:06:17.540> to<00:06:17.660> put<00:06:17.870> in<00:06:18.020> a<00:06:18.380> bigger<00:06:18.770> capsule

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:19.280 
opportunity to put in a bigger capsule

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:21.130 
opportunity to put in a bigger capsule
which<00:06:19.790> means<00:06:20.060> you<00:06:20.210> will<00:06:20.360> have<00:06:20.390> less<00:06:20.810> self

00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:21.140 
which means you will have less self

00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:23.770 
which means you will have less self
noise<00:06:21.380> so<00:06:22.070> the<00:06:22.280> noise<00:06:22.910> generated<00:06:23.540> by<00:06:23.720> the

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:23.780 
noise so the noise generated by the

00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:25.960 
noise so the noise generated by the
microphone<00:06:24.290> but<00:06:24.950> also<00:06:25.130> we<00:06:25.400> could<00:06:25.580> bring<00:06:25.820> in

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:25.970 
microphone but also we could bring in

00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:28.570 
microphone but also we could bring in
the<00:06:26.150> XLR<00:06:26.570> 3<00:06:26.840> connector<00:06:27.290> and<00:06:27.500> this<00:06:28.040> allows<00:06:28.340> you

00:06:28.570 --> 00:06:28.580 
the XLR 3 connector and this allows you

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:30.190 
the XLR 3 connector and this allows you
to<00:06:28.730> use<00:06:28.910> the<00:06:29.120> phantom<00:06:29.420> power<00:06:29.600> of<00:06:29.780> your<00:06:29.900> camera

00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:30.200 
to use the phantom power of your camera

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:32.650 
to use the phantom power of your camera
to<00:06:30.410> power<00:06:30.590> the<00:06:30.740> microphone<00:06:31.190> while<00:06:31.790> on<00:06:32.060> a<00:06:32.090> MK

00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:32.660 
to power the microphone while on a MK

00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:34.930 
to power the microphone while on a MK
400<00:06:33.230> you<00:06:33.380> have<00:06:33.560> to<00:06:33.740> replace<00:06:34.130> a<00:06:34.190> battery<00:06:34.490> every

00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:34.940 
400 you have to replace a battery every
