00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:17.039
 all welcome on my channel 

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:19.710
 informative with you Lena I will continue the topic 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:20.970
 my interior and I once had such 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.640
 wild and video 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:26.789
 although today do not wipe at all 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:29.850
 printer gel about the dishes which also 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:33.360
 each plate is a kind of object 

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:37.590
 art also how because all this 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:39.360
 painted by hand the body on the master Nikita 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.180
 just instant beauty 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.350
 a few words before i do 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:47.040
 to move forward in essence would like to say 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:49.950
 that i don't belong to that type of people 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:52.739
 which here they should have hearts 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:55.110
 everything is all the same and here it is necessary 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:57.780
 pick up when the guests were coming 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:00.510
 identical on a plate to this similar and 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:03.780
 and then a little more than that come 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:08.549
 like the Japanese I have they are the side of the plates 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:11.130
 a lot of Japanese dishes and me 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:13.380
 I like that every day I can 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.880
 mood choose yourself dishes as well 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:18.990
 and makeup that is 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:22.590
 the course colors on the mood and the case 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:26.249
 that the dishes service itself is some kind of 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:29.119
 an art object that is your day 

00:01:26.249 --> 00:01:31.700
 turns into something extraordinary and 

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:35.689
 fear i like to stand up 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:38.030

00:01:35.689 --> 00:01:41.360

 utensils course it costs money 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:56.270
 understandably so we will allow 

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:59.439
 some time saving and buying 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:03.319
