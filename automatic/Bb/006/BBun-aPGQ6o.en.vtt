00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:35.800 
explain how it works so as you know
water<00:01:33.500> benders<00:01:34.010> need<00:01:34.340> water<00:01:34.640> to<00:01:35.030> bend<00:01:35.360> of

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:35.810 
water benders need water to bend of

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:38.620 
water benders need water to bend of
course<00:01:36.200> water<00:01:36.320> so<00:01:37.130> it<00:01:37.729> is<00:01:37.940> your<00:01:38.120> choice<00:01:38.299> so<00:01:38.360> if

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:40.280 
I do this as you can see that my

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:43.120 
I do this as you can see that my
particle<00:01:40.640> stop<00:01:41.030> and<00:01:41.299> if<00:01:41.840> I<00:01:41.930> want<00:01:42.200> to<00:01:42.409> start<00:01:42.770> my

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:43.130 
particle stop and if I want to start my

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:44.410 
particle stop and if I want to start my
particles<00:01:43.520> as<00:01:43.640> you<00:01:43.729> can<00:01:43.850> see<00:01:43.970> all<00:01:44.090> I<00:01:44.120> have<00:01:44.210> to

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:44.420 
particles as you can see all I have to

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:47.530 
particles as you can see all I have to
do<00:01:44.540> is<00:01:44.659> dive<00:01:44.960> and<00:01:45.200> I<00:01:45.680> can<00:01:45.860> just<00:01:46.040> go<00:01:46.250> up<00:01:46.490> and<00:01:46.760> you

00:02:02.109 --> 00:02:02.119 
ignore these these are from the second

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:06.490 
ignore these these are from the second

move so you can carry a water bottle or

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:08.800 
move so you can carry a water bottle or
a<00:02:06.530> water<00:02:06.830> bucket<00:02:07.130> and<00:02:07.460> this<00:02:07.760> activates<00:02:08.360> so<00:02:08.689> if

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:08.810 
a water bucket and this activates so if

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:10.749 
a water bucket and this activates so if
I<00:02:08.899> remove<00:02:09.229> my<00:02:09.409> water<00:02:09.590> bucket<00:02:10.009> these<00:02:10.580> two

00:02:10.749 --> 00:02:10.759 
I remove my water bucket these two

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:13.539 
I remove my water bucket these two
activates<00:02:11.299> and<00:02:11.540> if<00:02:11.750> I<00:02:11.900> move<00:02:12.620> that<00:02:12.890> and<00:02:13.129> get<00:02:13.430> the

00:02:13.539 --> 00:02:13.549 
activates and if I move that and get the

00:02:13.549 --> 00:02:18.690 
activates and if I move that and get the
water<00:02:13.730> bucket<00:02:14.150> only<00:02:14.510> it<00:02:15.140> works

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:18.700 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:22.540 

so<00:02:19.700> the<00:02:19.940> second<00:02:20.360> one<00:02:20.480> is<00:02:20.750> pretty<00:02:21.380> simple<00:02:21.980> I<00:02:22.190> may

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:22.550 
so the second one is pretty simple I may

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:25.510 
so the second one is pretty simple I may
add<00:02:22.820> it<00:02:23.150> so<00:02:23.360> you<00:02:23.420> can<00:02:23.720> like<00:02:24.350> move<00:02:24.740> on<00:02:24.920> water<00:02:25.160> but

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:25.520 
add it so you can like move on water but

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:27.430 
add it so you can like move on water but
as<00:02:25.760> you<00:02:25.940> can<00:02:26.090> see<00:02:26.330> there's<00:02:26.600> particles<00:02:27.140> all

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:27.440 
as you can see there's particles all

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:30.130 
as you can see there's particles all
around<00:02:27.770> me<00:02:28.010> and<00:02:28.040> I<00:02:28.370> have<00:02:28.580> speed<00:02:28.940> too<00:02:29.360> and<00:02:29.600> water

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:30.140 
around me and I have speed too and water

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:32.250 
around me and I have speed too and water
bathing<00:02:30.620> so<00:02:30.800> this<00:02:31.070> is<00:02:31.220> practically<00:02:31.670> like

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.260 
bathing so this is practically like

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.570 
bathing so this is practically like
waterbending<00:02:33.260> under<00:02:33.590> water<00:02:33.800> so<00:02:34.100> you<00:02:34.160> can<00:02:34.400> use

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:34.580 
waterbending under water so you can use

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:37.860 
waterbending under water so you can use
this<00:02:34.850> I<00:02:35.150> don't<00:02:35.300> know<00:02:35.420> maybe<00:02:35.660> when<00:02:36.440> going<00:02:36.740> in<00:02:37.160> to

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:37.870 
this I don't know maybe when going in to

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:40.090 
this I don't know maybe when going in to
see<00:02:38.870> temple<00:02:39.320> and<00:02:39.590> you<00:02:39.680> know<00:02:39.800> you<00:02:39.860> want<00:02:40.070> to

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:40.100 
see temple and you know you want to

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:42.430 
see temple and you know you want to
break<00:02:40.400> some<00:02:40.700> stuff<00:02:40.730> you<00:02:41.420> can<00:02:41.630> use<00:02:41.660> this<00:02:42.050> move

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:42.440 
break some stuff you can use this move

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:45.790 
break some stuff you can use this move
to<00:02:42.680> kind<00:02:42.920> of<00:02:43.070> move<00:02:43.340> fast<00:02:43.880> even<00:02:44.420> though<00:02:45.140> you

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:45.800 
to kind of move fast even though you

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:47.740 
to kind of move fast even though you
need<00:02:45.920> deft<00:02:46.250> strider<00:02:46.670> to<00:02:46.970> run<00:02:47.150> fast<00:02:47.420> in<00:02:47.540> water

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:47.750 
need deft strider to run fast in water

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:49.810 
need deft strider to run fast in water
but<00:02:48.560> here<00:02:48.740> you<00:02:48.860> have<00:02:49.010> water<00:02:49.190> breathing<00:02:49.550> then

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:49.820 
but here you have water breathing then

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:52.660 
but here you have water breathing then
that's<00:02:50.090> infinite<00:02:50.680> yeah<00:02:51.680> so<00:02:52.010> it's<00:02:52.250> pretty<00:02:52.370> cool

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:52.670 
that's infinite yeah so it's pretty cool

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:57.640 
that's infinite yeah so it's pretty cool
and<00:02:52.850> let's<00:02:53.330> go<00:02:53.480> to<00:02:53.540> the<00:02:53.690> third<00:02:53.960> one<00:02:56.500> so<00:02:57.500> the

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:57.650 
and let's go to the third one so the

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:00.910 
and let's go to the third one so the
third<00:02:57.890> one<00:02:58.100> is<00:02:58.340> pretty<00:02:58.940> cool<00:02:59.300> it<00:02:59.600> is<00:02:59.920> pretty

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:00.920 
third one is pretty cool it is pretty

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:04.030 
third one is pretty cool it is pretty
much<00:03:01.040> like<00:03:01.430> blood<00:03:02.120> panting<00:03:02.570> so<00:03:02.870> if<00:03:03.350> I<00:03:03.500> hit<00:03:03.740> any

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:04.040 
much like blood panting so if I hit any

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:06.490 
much like blood panting so if I hit any
entity<00:03:04.610> in<00:03:04.790> my<00:03:04.970> areas<00:03:05.360> you<00:03:05.510> can<00:03:05.600> see<00:03:05.750> as<00:03:06.440> you

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:06.500 
entity in my areas you can see as you

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:08.440 
entity in my areas you can see as you
can<00:03:06.620> see<00:03:06.890> there<00:03:07.130> was<00:03:07.280> like<00:03:07.400> a<00:03:07.430> small<00:03:07.790> blood

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:08.450 
can see there was like a small blood

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:11.110 
can see there was like a small blood
particles<00:03:08.810> and<00:03:09.260> now<00:03:09.410> he's<00:03:09.620> slowed<00:03:10.010> so<00:03:10.610> why<00:03:10.880> his

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:11.120 
particles and now he's slowed so why his

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:12.460 
particles and now he's slowed so why his
thought<00:03:11.330> of<00:03:11.480> course<00:03:11.690> you<00:03:11.780> can<00:03:11.900> use<00:03:12.080> your<00:03:12.110> other

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:12.470 
thought of course you can use your other

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:15.040 
thought of course you can use your other
abilities<00:03:13.100> and<00:03:13.730> you<00:03:13.820> know<00:03:13.940> kill<00:03:14.300> your<00:03:14.570> enemies

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:15.050 
abilities and you know kill your enemies

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:17.230 
abilities and you know kill your enemies
so<00:03:15.080> it's<00:03:15.860> pretty<00:03:16.040> cool<00:03:16.310> it<00:03:16.520> just<00:03:16.760> give<00:03:17.030> them

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:17.240 
so it's pretty cool it just give them

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:19.360 
so it's pretty cool it just give them
slowness<00:03:17.750> and<00:03:18.050> yeah<00:03:18.290> they<00:03:18.530> pretty<00:03:18.890> much<00:03:19.040> can't

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:19.370 
slowness and yeah they pretty much can't

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:22.840 
slowness and yeah they pretty much can't
really<00:03:19.730> move<00:03:19.970> and<00:03:20.440> yeah<00:03:21.440> it's<00:03:21.710> cool<00:03:22.040> and<00:03:22.370> I

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:22.850 
really move and yeah it's cool and I

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:27.030 
really move and yeah it's cool and I
hope<00:03:23.060> you<00:03:23.240> like<00:03:23.420> it

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:27.040 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:30.960 

so<00:03:28.030> for<00:03:28.330> the<00:03:28.510> fourth<00:03:29.319> move<00:03:29.830> yes<00:03:30.280> you<00:03:30.519> will<00:03:30.700> need

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:30.970 
so for the fourth move yes you will need

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:36.030 
so for the fourth move yes you will need
water<00:03:31.810> or<00:03:32.670> a<00:03:33.670> bucket<00:03:34.360> so<00:03:34.720> if<00:03:35.049> I<00:03:35.290> get<00:03:35.620> a<00:03:35.650> water

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:36.040 
water or a bucket so if I get a water

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:39.119 
water or a bucket so if I get a water
bucket<00:03:36.459> or<00:03:36.819> a<00:03:36.879> water<00:03:37.269> potion<00:03:37.870> as<00:03:38.590> you<00:03:38.769> can<00:03:38.890> see

00:03:39.119 --> 00:03:39.129 
bucket or a water potion as you can see

00:03:39.129 --> 00:03:41.280 
bucket or a water potion as you can see
I<00:03:39.370> have<00:03:39.730> them<00:03:39.909> in<00:03:39.970> my<00:03:40.090> inventory<00:03:40.390> so<00:03:40.750> right<00:03:41.110> now

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:41.290 
I have them in my inventory so right now

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:43.319 
I have them in my inventory so right now
this<00:03:41.530> is<00:03:41.680> being<00:03:41.890> activated<00:03:42.430> I<00:03:42.790> will<00:03:43.120> probably

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:43.329 
this is being activated I will probably

00:03:43.329 --> 00:03:46.740 
this is being activated I will probably
add<00:03:43.959> particles<00:03:44.769> when<00:03:45.129> this<00:03:45.340> is<00:03:45.489> like<00:03:46.360> ready<00:03:46.629> to

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:46.750 
add particles when this is like ready to

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:51.720 
add particles when this is like ready to
be<00:03:47.290> you<00:03:48.250> know<00:03:48.370> like<00:03:48.790> used<00:03:49.269> so<00:03:50.340> this<00:03:51.340> is<00:03:51.549> pretty

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:51.730 
be you know like used so this is pretty

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:55.319 
be you know like used so this is pretty
much<00:03:51.849> like<00:03:52.150> healing<00:03:53.220> entities<00:03:54.220> or<00:03:54.489> enemies<00:03:54.970> or

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:55.329 
much like healing entities or enemies or

00:03:55.329 --> 00:03:56.009 
much like healing entities or enemies or
even<00:03:55.359> you<00:03:55.840> know

00:03:56.009 --> 00:03:56.019 
even you know

00:03:56.019 --> 00:03:58.920 
even you know
allies<00:03:56.709> I<00:03:56.950> guess<00:03:57.159> if<00:03:57.400> you<00:03:57.549> will<00:03:57.790> add<00:03:58.329> allies<00:03:58.750> in

00:03:58.920 --> 00:03:58.930 
allies I guess if you will add allies in

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:02.130 
allies I guess if you will add allies in
your<00:03:59.079> world<00:03:59.319> so<00:03:59.890> if<00:04:00.129> I<00:04:00.250> punch<00:04:00.670> any<00:04:01.140> like

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:02.140 
your world so if I punch any like

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:04.940 
your world so if I punch any like
anything<00:04:03.069> in<00:04:03.340> this<00:04:03.489> area<00:04:03.819> they<00:04:04.030> will<00:04:04.209> get<00:04:04.420> ups

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:04.950 
anything in this area they will get ups

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:07.949 
anything in this area they will get ups
they<00:04:05.950> will<00:04:06.190> get<00:04:06.370> region<00:04:07.299> so<00:04:07.599> as<00:04:07.720> you<00:04:07.810> can<00:04:07.900> see

00:04:07.949 --> 00:04:07.959 
they will get region so as you can see

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:10.520 
they will get region so as you can see
he<00:04:08.200> has<00:04:08.349> those<00:04:08.829> particles<00:04:09.459> that<00:04:10.180> are

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:10.530 
he has those particles that are

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:16.890 
he has those particles that are
regenerating<00:04:11.609> regenerating<00:04:12.609> this<00:04:12.819> health<00:04:15.900> so

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:16.900 
regenerating regenerating this health so
