 911 facilities in guayaquil that 

00:00:05.499 --> 00:00:09.160
 this time he had become 

00:00:07.299 --> 00:00:12.009
 the space flight control center 

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:14.230
 the reason for everyone to be there was 

00:00:12.009 --> 00:00:16.660
 one only for the first time was put in 

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:19.360
 orbit the first Ecuadorian satellite of 

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:21.490
 Pegasus name and that this was given thanks 

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:23.290
 to the Ecuadorian space project with the 

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:25.720
 Ecuadorian cosmonaut ronnie nader to the 

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:27.760
 anxious head expected the takeoff 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:29.920
 of the ship that would lead to the first viewer 

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:32.379
 Ecuadorian to space from the base of 

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:37.110
 jiuquan in china the 

00:00:32.379 --> 00:00:37.110
 launch 54 

00:00:37.289 --> 00:00:46.670

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:48.140
 l m2 carrying on board ns1 pegasus primer 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:52.030
 Ecuadorian satellite takes off if the 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:52.030
 space has left the tower 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:01.519
 minutes that can never be forgotten and with 

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:03.320
 present dignities the congratulations 

00:01:01.519 --> 00:01:05.390
 they did not wait 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:08.000
 the pegasus satellite was in orbit 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:10.760
 confirmed 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.300
 welcome to heaven pegasus welcome to 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:13.300
 space by 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:22.330
 then the words of encouragement from 

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:25.360
 president of six years ago he would have 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:28.000
 dreamed of this of course also that 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:30.100
 that half century plus first relationship 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.840
 satellite within the gap is huge 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:32.830
 with the most developed countries here 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:35.380
 is the key in science and technology 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:36.970
 very started and what that gap 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:39.250
 politics 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:41.950
 I fear that more serious pegasus will have as 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:43.390
 goal from the space educate since 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:46.230
 students of educational institutions 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:49.090
 they will be able to see the equator from the universe 

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:50.770
 the pegasus happens in the mornings so that 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:53.490
 they can take it in schools and they can 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:56.460
 study the children with him 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:58.860
 but it only happens for a few minutes without 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.869
 However this does not conclude kit because in 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:04.020
 the next few months will launch a second 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:07.080
 Satellite leaving even above the 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:09.590
 name of the equator july caesar zone 24 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:09.590
