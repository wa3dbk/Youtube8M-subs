00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
and matt white so now that we have the

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.520 
and matt white so now that we have the
base<00:01:56.220> layer<00:01:56.490> down<00:01:56.670> for<00:01:56.940> the<00:01:57.060> the<00:01:57.959> vest<00:01:58.200> it's

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
base layer down for the the vest it's

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.139 
base layer down for the the vest it's
time<00:01:58.770> to<00:01:58.920> do<00:01:59.039> the<00:01:59.159> final<00:01:59.310> layer<00:01:59.640> which<00:01:59.850> will<00:02:00.030> be

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
time to do the final layer which will be

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:02.090 
time to do the final layer which will be
a<00:02:00.390> matte<00:02:00.810> white<00:02:00.990> and<00:02:01.380> it's<00:02:01.649> best<00:02:01.860> to<00:02:01.950> apply

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
a matte white and it's best to apply

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.710 
a matte white and it's best to apply
this<00:02:02.189> kind<00:02:02.520> of<00:02:02.549> water<00:02:02.789> damage<00:02:03.240> build<00:02:03.479> up<00:02:03.630> the

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:03.720 
this kind of water damage build up the

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:05.809 
this kind of water damage build up the
layers<00:02:04.039> otherwise<00:02:05.039> you'll<00:02:05.250> end<00:02:05.399> up<00:02:05.549> kind<00:02:05.700> of

00:02:05.809 --> 00:02:05.819 
layers otherwise you'll end up kind of

00:02:05.819 --> 00:02:09.020 
layers otherwise you'll end up kind of
