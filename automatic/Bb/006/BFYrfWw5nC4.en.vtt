00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:07.520
 it also wants success 

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:13.400
 so today the text of the management gtx 590 none of the graphics cards the 

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:15.389
 more powerful market 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:18.539
 and we unpack right now 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:21.289
 so which carton 

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:25.319
 pr pretty awesome why these models of the mark msi 

00:00:25.319 --> 00:00:29.350
 a more classic model he does not have to see that the alert maria speaks 

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:32.350
 it is not even more than yesterday machining it is a standard model 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:36.220
 so who knows this is not the first time that the debates weapons is 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:38.650
 what went in a little bit how it looks 

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:40.210
 while we believed 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:42.090
 the graphics card 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:43.380
 in the carton 

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:46.720
 I told the boss 

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:49.830
 and percent I'm going to show you that what he has like 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.700
 adapter the first with 

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:58.880
 c card 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.090
 so 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.400
 in the box we have a vga tours adapter 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.330
 an adapter for visits to his home 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:18.900
 and not an adapter 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.730
 mini display port 

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:23.910
 to hdmi 

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:27.600
 but learning that one finds the documentation and the cd of the speakers of the 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.600
 it's all classic but it's all for nothing 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.460
 so as usual at but if head of the subject but many marks the 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.480
 cardboard and ten times too big compared to the card 

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:40.560
 so now I'm going to introduce you 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.490
 the map itself 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:44.450
 we could see 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:48.470
 the reference fan so his consoles fan years 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:50.970
 in the center of the map 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.490
 listen to the corridor map country 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.140
 r lengthy 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.140
 you tell me that just after 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:01.090
 on the slice so it's a slate 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:03.000
 you have 3 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.040
 dv iii 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:08.390
 and when mini display port there is no elite agent you are obliged 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:11.749
 to go through an adapter and that's rather a pity but good 

00:02:11.749 --> 00:02:14.749
 it's not very very far 

00:02:15.649 --> 00:02:17.799
 then can see 

00:02:17.799 --> 00:02:21.669
 that the whole map and fully careened we do not see at all 

00:02:24.279 --> 00:02:26.269
 lawyers loudÃ©ac 

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:29.269
 everything is hidden in the air the cart 

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:34.920
 feeds this fund on top so what is a benefit 

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:41.060
 to be able to enter the card more easily in the client boxes a little 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:43.819
 wrong or wrong 

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:46.589
 so it's a bit of a disadvantage if you have a case 

00:02:46.589 --> 00:02:49.719
 who leaves compares to a lot of depth 

00:02:49.719 --> 00:02:52.009
 who can htpc enclosures 

00:02:52.009 --> 00:02:55.699
 so you see that these two foods passion coated pin 

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:59.879
 so it will take the thoughts to have a pretty powerful diet 

00:03:00.469 --> 00:03:05.069
 because the power supplies tessier exploit suffered pin still 

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:08.069
 reserve dare modern diet 

00:03:09.749 --> 00:03:12.319
 on the back of the map you have 

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:15.319
 d small protection 

00:03:16.339 --> 00:03:18.869
 plastic directly aimed 

00:03:18.869 --> 00:03:21.869
 on the map 

00:03:22.509 --> 00:03:24.129
 and now 

00:03:24.129 --> 00:03:27.129
 the duration 

00:03:34.679 --> 00:03:36.579
 we are dead 

00:03:36.579 --> 00:03:39.579
 the coast 

00:03:41.009 --> 00:03:44.009
 so the card is exactly 

00:03:46.409 --> 00:03:49.449
 ap 

00:03:49.449 --> 00:03:51.350
 28 centimeters children 

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:53.999
 almost 29 centimeters long 

00:03:53.999 --> 00:03:55.709
 so it will really have to see 

00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:57.109
 a tower 

00:03:57.109 --> 00:04:00.769
 with a lot of space to be able to enter such a monster 

00:04:06.289 --> 00:04:09.279
 so here I forced to 198 x 

00:04:09.279 --> 00:04:14.139
 and actually consists of two gpu of those gtx 580 

00:04:14.139 --> 00:04:16.370
 you give him performances 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:18.499
 really very high 

00:04:18.499 --> 00:04:24.129
 for having made some games then for the starfish starter with that 

00:04:24.129 --> 00:04:25.689
 all the time of a hatch 

00:04:25.689 --> 00:04:30.189
 the fake anti-aliasing and 4 the old to tropism times 16 i get to an average 

00:04:30.189 --> 00:04:34.599
 60 frames per second but in my opinion it's just that I live 

00:04:34.599 --> 00:04:37.050
 shot forgot to remove the vertical sync 

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:39.139
 but so there is absolutely 

00:04:39.139 --> 00:04:43.180
 I had a drop in frenois and if I stay stagnant at 60 frames per second 

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:48.120
 even when you try to launch a mothership she proposes with this 

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:50.199
 place of units below 

00:04:50.199 --> 00:04:54.060
 I made a second text on battlefield beta 2 3 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:58.060
 and then so with all in a direct hatch x11 

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:03.400
 in full hd anti-aliasing take four old to tropism times 16 I arrive 

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:06.870
 at an average of 80 one they swim per second 

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:09.889
 which is still pretty balÃ¨ze for this game that does not miss a lot of 

00:05:09.889 --> 00:05:11.589
 power 

00:05:11.589 --> 00:05:15.809
 so it's really a graphics card between May 10 of 10 m eur she is very 

00:05:15.809 --> 00:05:20.039
 very powerful but I found that by counted a price-performance ratio 

00:05:20.039 --> 00:05:23.449
 bad enough considering that it costs more than 700 euros 

00:05:23.449 --> 00:05:27.569
 it's really a graphic card to be reserved for the purists and those who 

00:05:27.569 --> 00:05:32.909
 have it be a 3D video game configuration besides a configuration on 

00:05:32.909 --> 00:05:34.569
 a small screen 

00:05:34.569 --> 00:05:38.220
 what I do not see activate such a power can be useful 

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:43.550
 little point of detail when the graphics card is turned on and you have a 

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:47.430
 small logo g force that is lit on the edge of the card 

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:50.110
 it's pretty 

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:54.090
 this is the one that will introduce you to lara msi 

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:58.150
 I forced 590 gx 

00:05:59.309 --> 00:06:02.759
 and percent and I hope you have taught so that as it takes on 

00:06:02.759 --> 00:06:05.509
 this graphic card if you have questions or comments do not hesitate 

00:06:05.509 --> 00:06:09.809
 not to post them on the youtube channel or on the website tee we test all points 

00:06:09.809 --> 00:06:10.729
 common 

00:06:10.729 --> 00:06:13.949
 I thank you for watching videos and I'll see you soon for a 

00:06:13.949 --> 00:06:14.289
 new test
