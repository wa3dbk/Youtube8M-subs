Roland V trigger or V gate and also Moog
s<00:00:24.990> trigger<00:00:26.330> so<00:00:27.380> it's<00:00:28.380> compatible<00:00:28.769> with<00:00:29.039> both

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
s trigger so it's compatible with both

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.560 
s trigger so it's compatible with both
types<00:00:30.269> of<00:00:30.480> gate<00:00:30.810> control<00:00:31.320> also<00:00:32.099> has<00:00:32.460> a<00:00:32.489> CV<00:00:33.120> well

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
types of gate control also has a CV well

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.220 
types of gate control also has a CV well
of<00:00:33.750> course<00:00:33.809> it<00:00:34.230> has<00:00:34.350> a<00:00:34.380> CV<00:00:34.890> input<00:00:35.520> as<00:00:35.700> well<00:00:36.230> to

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
of course it has a CV input as well to

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.060 
of course it has a CV input as well to
control<00:00:37.590> the<00:00:37.739> pitch<00:00:38.329> over<00:00:39.329> the<00:00:39.510> 1580<00:00:40.230> so<00:00:41.010> you

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
control the pitch over the 1580 so you

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:46.130 
control the pitch over the 1580 so you
record<00:00:42.290> sound<00:00:43.399> into<00:00:44.399> the<00:00:44.610> 1580<00:00:45.420> using<00:00:46.050> the

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
record sound into the 1580 using the

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.910 
record sound into the 1580 using the
locking<00:00:46.530> function<00:00:46.770> and<00:00:48.140> then<00:00:49.140> you<00:00:49.500> can<00:00:49.680> play

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
locking function and then you can play

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.639 
locking function and then you can play
it<00:00:51.020> the<00:00:52.020> that<00:00:52.379> you<00:00:52.530> can<00:00:52.649> play<00:00:52.860> the<00:00:53.129> recording

00:00:54.639 --> 00:00:54.649 
it the that you can play the recording

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:59.529 
it the that you can play the recording
across<00:00:55.649> the<00:00:55.800> keyboard<00:00:56.010> I<00:00:56.809> quickly<00:00:57.809> put<00:00:58.590> in<00:00:58.739> a

00:00:59.529 --> 00:00:59.539 
across the keyboard I quickly put in a

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:02.510 
across the keyboard I quickly put in a
Accord<00:01:00.539> from<00:01:00.840> the<00:01:00.960> Moog<00:01:01.170> just<00:01:02.160> to<00:01:02.250> show<00:01:02.460> you

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
Accord from the Moog just to show you

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:03.979 
Accord from the Moog just to show you
what<00:01:02.789> it<00:01:02.879> does<00:01:03.120> what<00:01:03.480> if<00:01:03.600> you<00:01:03.690> watch<00:01:03.840> the

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
what it does what if you watch the

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.170 
what it does what if you watch the
screen<00:01:04.290> you'll<00:01:04.470> see<00:01:04.500> the<00:01:04.680> pitch<00:01:04.949> change<00:01:05.400> you

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
screen you'll see the pitch change you

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.399 
screen you'll see the pitch change you
can<00:01:06.299> obviously<00:01:06.570> see<00:01:06.810> set<00:01:07.110> out<00:01:07.260> the<00:01:07.409> scale

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:09.409 
can obviously see set out the scale

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:11.810 
can obviously see set out the scale
that's<00:01:10.409> what<00:01:10.619> these<00:01:10.799> controls<00:01:11.250> are<00:01:11.430> for<00:01:11.580> here

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
that's what these controls are for here

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:12.800 
that's what these controls are for here
coarse<00:01:12.210> and<00:01:12.450> fine

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
coarse and fine

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.950 
coarse and fine
you've<00:01:13.590> got<00:01:13.770> key<00:01:14.070> a<00:01:14.100> which<00:01:14.610> is<00:01:14.820> channel<00:01:15.240> a<00:01:15.600> of

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
you've got key a which is channel a of

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.440 
you've got key a which is channel a of
the<00:01:16.259> 1580<00:01:17.189> key<00:01:18.180> B<00:01:18.390> channel<00:01:18.990> B<00:01:19.170> of<00:01:19.439> the<00:01:19.530> 1580

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:20.450 
the 1580 key B channel B of the 1580

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:26.300 
the 1580 key B channel B of the 1580
pitch<00:01:21.450> is<00:01:21.869> just<00:01:23.750> remote<00:01:24.750> control<00:01:25.290> of<00:01:25.710> a<00:01:25.920> and<00:01:26.130> B

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
pitch is just remote control of a and B

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:31.550 
pitch is just remote control of a and B
channels<00:01:26.850> and<00:01:29.299> chorus<00:01:30.299> is<00:01:31.170> another

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
channels and chorus is another

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:32.899 
channels and chorus is another
functional<00:01:32.040> together<00:01:32.400> I'll<00:01:32.549> show<00:01:32.729> you<00:01:32.790> that

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
functional together I'll show you that

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:38.210 
functional together I'll show you that
in<00:01:33.030> a<00:01:33.060> sec<00:01:35.840> basically<00:01:36.840> yeah<00:01:37.200> press<00:01:37.680> a<00:01:37.710> few<00:01:37.920> keys

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
in a sec basically yeah press a few keys

00:01:38.220 --> 00:02:02.310 
in a sec basically yeah press a few keys
and<00:01:38.490> you'll<00:01:38.579> hear<00:01:38.790> it

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:02.320 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:05.230 

so<00:02:03.320> that's<00:02:03.530> the<00:02:03.909> keyboard<00:02:04.909> interface

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:05.240 
so that's the keyboard interface

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:10.710 
so that's the keyboard interface
function<00:02:05.990> and<00:02:06.770> if<00:02:06.890> you<00:02:07.009> take<00:02:07.250> the<00:02:07.790> 1580<00:02:08.420> out<00:02:08.810> of

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:10.720 
function and if you take the 1580 out of

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:12.220 
function and if you take the 1580 out of
locking<00:02:11.720> mode

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.230 
locking mode

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:19.570 
locking mode
I'll<00:02:13.010> give<00:02:13.280> it<00:02:13.310> a<00:02:13.430> clear<00:02:17.380> and<00:02:18.380> then<00:02:19.069> I'll<00:02:19.370> show

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:19.580 
I'll give it a clear and then I'll show

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:20.860 
I'll give it a clear and then I'll show
you<00:02:19.640> the<00:02:19.760> chorus<00:02:20.060> function<00:02:20.510> basically

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:20.870 
you the chorus function basically

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:28.030 
you the chorus function basically
turning<00:02:21.590> on<00:02:21.680> the<00:02:21.800> chorus<00:02:22.930> does<00:02:23.930> this<00:02:26.860> now<00:02:27.860> what

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:28.040 
turning on the chorus does this now what

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.100 
turning on the chorus does this now what
it's<00:02:28.130> doing<00:02:28.160> is<00:02:28.610> flipping<00:02:28.910> between<00:02:29.510> a<00:02:29.750> and<00:02:29.930> B

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:30.110 
it's doing is flipping between a and B

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:36.039 
it's doing is flipping between a and B
channels<00:02:30.680> and<00:02:33.519> making<00:02:34.519> the<00:02:34.730> pitch<00:02:35.390> go<00:02:35.690> up<00:02:35.870> and

00:02:36.039 --> 00:02:36.049 
channels and making the pitch go up and

00:02:36.049 --> 00:02:39.009 
channels and making the pitch go up and
down<00:02:36.519> randomly<00:02:37.519> it's<00:02:37.940> a<00:02:38.060> pitch<00:02:38.269> randomizer

00:02:39.009 --> 00:02:39.019 
down randomly it's a pitch randomizer

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:41.500 
down randomly it's a pitch randomizer
it's<00:02:39.680> a<00:02:39.799> very<00:02:40.069> very<00:02:40.459> good<00:02:40.549> chorus<00:02:41.150> effect

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:41.510 
it's a very very good chorus effect

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:45.220 
it's a very very good chorus effect
stereo<00:02:41.959> chorus<00:02:42.260> effect<00:02:43.420> has<00:02:44.420> nothing<00:02:44.900> to<00:02:44.930> do

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:45.230 
stereo chorus effect has nothing to do

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:49.240 
stereo chorus effect has nothing to do
with<00:02:45.410> the<00:02:45.560> VCO<00:02:46.010> depth<00:02:46.910> and<00:02:47.150> speed<00:02:48.250> basically

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:49.250 
with the VCO depth and speed basically

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:50.410 
with the VCO depth and speed basically
you've<00:02:49.400> still<00:02:49.670> got<00:02:49.880> that<00:02:49.910> and<00:02:50.209> that's<00:02:50.330> a

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:50.420 
you've still got that and that's a

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:53.650 
you've still got that and that's a
separate<00:02:50.870> separate<00:02:51.410> modulation<00:02:51.920> effect<00:02:52.660> so

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:53.660 
separate separate modulation effect so

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:58.660 
separate separate modulation effect so
you've<00:02:54.140> got<00:02:54.350> a<00:02:54.380> speed<00:02:55.100> here<00:02:55.400> and<00:02:56.709> death<00:02:57.709> so<00:02:58.580> you

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:58.670 
you've got a speed here and death so you

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:01.360 
you've got a speed here and death so you
can<00:02:58.790> get<00:02:59.080> serious<00:03:00.080> wobble<00:03:00.500> or<00:03:00.739> just<00:03:01.040> a<00:03:01.160> light

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:01.370 
can get serious wobble or just a light

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:05.170 
can get serious wobble or just a light
stereo<00:03:02.330> chorus<00:03:03.370> and<00:03:04.370> slow<00:03:04.640> it<00:03:04.700> down<00:03:04.790> you<00:03:05.030> can

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:05.180 
stereo chorus and slow it down you can

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:22.740 
stereo chorus and slow it down you can
see<00:03:05.360> it<00:03:05.450> flip<00:03:09.310> there's<00:03:10.310> some<00:03:10.459> depth<00:03:10.700> on<00:03:10.880> it

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:22.750 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:52.780 

that's<00:03:23.750> of<00:03:23.959> course<00:03:24.140> effect
