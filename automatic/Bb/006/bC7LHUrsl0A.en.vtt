5 by 11 bearings for this purpose now I

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:20.970 
5 by 11 bearings for this purpose now I
appreciate<00:02:20.050> the<00:02:20.410> fact<00:02:20.560> that<00:02:20.709> they've

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:20.980 
appreciate the fact that they've

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:24.390 
appreciate the fact that they've
upgraded<00:02:21.420> to<00:02:22.420> using<00:02:22.720> 5<00:02:22.900> by<00:02:23.050> 11<00:02:23.380> very<00:02:23.890> barren

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:27.630 
upgraded to using 5 by 11 very barren
carriers<00:02:24.790> that's<00:02:25.450> cool<00:02:25.860> but<00:02:26.860> leaving<00:02:27.250> me<00:02:27.370> with

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640 
carriers that's cool but leaving me with

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:29.910 
carriers that's cool but leaving me with
four<00:02:28.360> five<00:02:28.750> by<00:02:28.959> ten<00:02:29.170> bearings<00:02:29.650> that<00:02:29.739> are

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:29.920 
four five by ten bearings that are

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:33.540 
four five by ten bearings that are
completely<00:02:30.280> useless<00:02:30.750> that's<00:02:31.750> not<00:02:32.050> cool<00:02:32.550> so

he gave me one of these nuts to finish
everything<00:03:03.340> off<00:03:03.700> and<00:03:04.030> I<00:03:04.390> needed<00:03:04.600> to

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:23.860 

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:44.360 

oh<00:03:36.600> look<00:03:37.600> what<00:03:37.780> I<00:03:37.810> can<00:03:38.020> do<00:03:40.380> all<00:03:41.380> four<00:03:41.710> corners

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:44.370 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:46.830 

this<00:03:45.370> is<00:03:45.520> an<00:03:45.670> interesting<00:03:45.940> structure<00:03:46.480> back

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:46.840 
this is an interesting structure back

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:49.260 
this is an interesting structure back
here<00:03:47.140> and<00:03:47.290> this<00:03:47.380> whole<00:03:47.590> brace<00:03:48.550> thing<00:03:49.030> it

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:49.270 
here and this whole brace thing it

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:52.830 
here and this whole brace thing it
provides<00:03:50.010> strength<00:03:51.010> to<00:03:52.000> the<00:03:52.180> shock<00:03:52.540> tower<00:03:52.750> a

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:52.840 
provides strength to the shock tower a

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:54.480 
provides strength to the shock tower a
little<00:03:53.050> bit<00:03:53.140> of<00:03:53.230> bracing<00:03:53.860> to<00:03:53.980> the<00:03:54.070> shock<00:03:54.250> tower

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:54.490 
little bit of bracing to the shock tower

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:57.210 
little bit of bracing to the shock tower
provides<00:03:55.390> a<00:03:55.540> little<00:03:55.720> bit<00:03:55.810> of<00:03:55.900> bracing<00:03:56.320> to<00:03:56.830> the

00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:57.220 
provides a little bit of bracing to the

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:59.730 
provides a little bit of bracing to the
transmission<00:03:57.850> itself<00:03:58.390> and<00:03:58.660> just<00:03:58.840> kind<00:03:59.680> of

00:03:59.730 --> 00:03:59.740 
transmission itself and just kind of

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:02.430 
transmission itself and just kind of
creates<00:04:00.070> a<00:04:00.220> small<00:04:00.970> little<00:04:01.150> cage<00:04:01.570> back<00:04:02.080> here

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:02.440 
creates a small little cage back here

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:06.690 
creates a small little cage back here
with<00:04:03.280> a<00:04:03.540> almost<00:04:04.540> an<00:04:04.720> arc<00:04:04.989> shape<00:04:05.489> going<00:04:06.489> across

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:06.700 
with a almost an arc shape going across

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:10.010 
with a almost an arc shape going across
it<00:04:07.410> interesting<00:04:08.410> something<00:04:08.680> I<00:04:08.890> have<00:04:09.070> not

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:10.020 
it interesting something I have not

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:13.800 
it interesting something I have not
assembled<00:04:11.020> before<00:04:11.230> on<00:04:11.709> any<00:04:11.890> any<00:04:12.580> car<00:04:13.060> see<00:04:13.720> have

are<00:04:18.370> going<00:04:18.519> to<00:04:18.579> attach<00:04:18.790> here<00:04:19.419> not<00:04:19.810> on<00:04:20.169> to<00:04:20.650> the

00:04:20.909 --> 00:04:20.919 
are going to attach here not on to the

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:24.030 
are going to attach here not on to the
shock<00:04:21.640> tower<00:04:21.910> itself<00:04:22.380> okay<00:04:23.380> so<00:04:23.500> that<00:04:23.710> does<00:04:23.890> it

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:24.040 
shock tower itself okay so that does it

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:26.700 
shock tower itself okay so that does it
for<00:04:24.280> the<00:04:24.430> Assembly<00:04:24.910> of<00:04:24.940> the<00:04:25.210> rear<00:04:25.720> end<00:04:26.020> got<00:04:26.590> the

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:26.710 
for the Assembly of the rear end got the

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:28.920 
for the Assembly of the rear end got the
suspension<00:04:27.220> hooked<00:04:27.370> up<00:04:27.780> transmissions<00:04:28.780> in

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:28.930 
suspension hooked up transmissions in

suspension hooked up transmissions in
place<00:04:29.200> everything<00:04:30.100> seems<00:04:31.060> to<00:04:31.180> be<00:04:31.360> pretty

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:31.770 
place everything seems to be pretty

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:34.890 
place everything seems to be pretty
secure<00:04:32.770> held<00:04:33.700> together<00:04:33.850> pretty<00:04:34.210> nicely<00:04:34.330> there

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:34.900 
secure held together pretty nicely there

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:38.610 
secure held together pretty nicely there
so<00:04:35.740> I<00:04:35.770> will<00:04:36.340> reserve<00:04:36.850> the<00:04:37.180> final<00:04:37.870> video<00:04:38.050> for
