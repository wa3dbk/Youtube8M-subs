above fireplaces more and more often

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:36.979 
above fireplaces more and more often
we've<00:00:35.670> been<00:00:35.850> seeing<00:00:36.059> that<00:00:36.210> for<00:00:36.450> many<00:00:36.690> years

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
we've been seeing that for many years

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:40.340 
we've been seeing that for many years
there<00:00:37.250> jet<00:00:38.250> master<00:00:38.700> hidden<00:00:39.000> glow<00:00:39.180> have<00:00:40.140> been

in<00:00:42.780> a<00:00:42.870> showroom<00:00:43.140> in<00:00:43.620> this<00:00:44.370> show<00:00:44.789> here<00:00:45.120> in

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
in a showroom in this show here in

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.740 
in a showroom in this show here in
Oakley<00:00:45.690> as<00:00:46.260> well<00:00:46.530> and<00:00:47.090> this<00:00:48.090> is<00:00:48.270> probably<00:00:48.480> the

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
Oakley as well and this is probably the

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.040 
Oakley as well and this is probably the
best<00:00:49.170> case<00:00:49.469> scenario<00:00:49.610> out<00:00:50.610> of<00:00:50.789> probably

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:51.050 
best case scenario out of probably

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:55.430 
best case scenario out of probably
properly<00:00:52.050> I<00:00:52.199> should<00:00:52.649> say<00:00:53.300> recess<00:00:54.300> a<00:00:54.510> TV<00:00:54.989> above

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
properly I should say recess a TV above

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:56.930 
properly I should say recess a TV above
the<00:00:55.500> fireplace<00:00:55.590> so<00:00:56.070> we<00:00:56.190> talk<00:00:56.340> about<00:00:56.460> recess

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
the fireplace so we talk about recess

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.520 
the fireplace so we talk about recess
what<00:00:57.420> we're<00:00:57.570> referring<00:00:57.690> to<00:00:57.989> here<00:00:58.289> as<00:00:58.379> you<00:00:58.500> can

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
what we're referring to here as you can

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.709 
what we're referring to here as you can
see<00:00:58.649> that<00:00:58.949> the<00:00:59.070> TV<00:00:59.460> is<00:00:59.820> not<00:00:59.910> actually<00:01:00.449> flush

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
see that the TV is not actually flush

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.630 
see that the TV is not actually flush
with<00:01:00.960> the<00:01:01.050> wall<00:01:01.199> the<00:01:01.649> TV<00:01:01.980> is<00:01:02.100> actually<00:01:02.430> sitting

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
with the wall the TV is actually sitting

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.020 
with the wall the TV is actually sitting
back<00:01:02.969> inside<00:01:03.809> the<00:01:03.989> wall<00:01:04.170> so<00:01:04.860> you<00:01:05.489> can't<00:01:05.790> do

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
back inside the wall so you can't do

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.820 
back inside the wall so you can't do
that<00:01:06.150> with<00:01:06.330> all<00:01:06.570> fireplaces<00:01:07.140> you<00:01:07.409> can't<00:01:07.619> do

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
that with all fireplaces you can't do

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.880 
that with all fireplaces you can't do
that<00:01:08.119> with<00:01:09.119> in<00:01:09.540> certain<00:01:09.840> scenarios<00:01:10.320> the

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
that with in certain scenarios the

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.890 
that with in certain scenarios the
flowing<00:01:11.280> of<00:01:11.430> the<00:01:11.640> fireplace<00:01:11.880> can<00:01:12.390> also<00:01:12.540> play<00:01:12.869> a

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
flowing of the fireplace can also play a

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.810 
flowing of the fireplace can also play a
major<00:01:13.020> role<00:01:13.350> in<00:01:13.530> that<00:01:13.830> whether<00:01:14.220> you<00:01:14.369> whether

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
major role in that whether you whether

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.090 
major role in that whether you whether
you<00:01:15.000> can<00:01:15.270> actually<00:01:15.570> recess<00:01:16.530> the<00:01:16.619> television

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
you can actually recess the television

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.219 
you can actually recess the television
or<00:01:17.280> not<00:01:17.580> but<00:01:18.150> this<00:01:18.420> is<00:01:18.479> a<00:01:18.600> very<00:01:18.900> good<00:01:19.110> example

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
or not but this is a very good example

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:22.190 
or not but this is a very good example
of<00:01:19.830> a<00:01:20.640> perfect<00:01:21.030> scenario<00:01:21.150> where<00:01:21.659> the<00:01:21.780> TV<00:01:22.140> is

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
of a perfect scenario where the TV is

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.410 
of a perfect scenario where the TV is
nicely<00:01:22.530> recessed<00:01:23.100> in<00:01:23.340> it's<00:01:24.000> only<00:01:24.150> a<00:01:24.240> few

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
nicely recessed in it's only a few

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.350 
nicely recessed in it's only a few
millimeters<00:01:24.960> away<00:01:25.049> from<00:01:25.170> the<00:01:25.470> edge<00:01:25.560> of

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:26.360 
millimeters away from the edge of

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:28.700 
millimeters away from the edge of
firebox<00:01:27.360> from<00:01:27.840> the<00:01:27.960> edge<00:01:28.049> of<00:01:28.200> the<00:01:28.259> first<00:01:28.560> of

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
firebox from the edge of the first of

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.190 
firebox from the edge of the first of
all<00:01:28.829> I<00:01:28.860> should<00:01:28.920> say<00:01:29.220> the<00:01:30.090> heat<00:01:30.329> and<00:01:30.630> that's

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
all I should say the heat and that's

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.140 
all I should say the heat and that's
actually<00:01:31.350> protruding<00:01:31.950> from<00:01:32.100> the<00:01:32.280> heat<00:01:33.030> and

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
actually protruding from the heat and

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.890 
actually protruding from the heat and
low<00:01:33.329> unit<00:01:33.840> is<00:01:34.619> rising<00:01:35.400> as<00:01:35.549> you<00:01:35.790> know<00:01:35.970> but<00:01:36.390> it's

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
low unit is rising as you know but it's

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.600 
low unit is rising as you know but it's
not<00:01:37.110> affecting<00:01:37.500> the<00:01:37.530> team

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
not affecting the team

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.000 
not affecting the team
so<00:01:39.690> if<00:01:40.690> this<00:01:40.900> is<00:01:41.080> the<00:01:41.110> correct<00:01:41.470> way<00:01:41.590> to<00:01:41.710> have<00:01:41.980> it

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:42.010 
so if this is the correct way to have it

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:43.500 
so if this is the correct way to have it
all<00:01:42.160> set<00:01:42.340> up<00:01:42.370> what<00:01:42.820> are<00:01:42.940> some<00:01:43.090> of<00:01:43.210> the<00:01:43.300> pitfalls

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:43.510 
all set up what are some of the pitfalls

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:46.200 
all set up what are some of the pitfalls
that<00:01:43.900> people<00:01:44.320> don't<00:01:44.920> consider<00:01:45.190> out<00:01:45.820> what's<00:01:46.120> an

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:46.210 
that people don't consider out what's an

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:49.500 
that people don't consider out what's an
unsafe<00:01:46.720> way<00:01:47.020> that<00:01:47.230> it<00:01:47.350> can<00:01:47.500> be<00:01:47.650> set<00:01:48.520> up<00:01:48.550> well

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:49.510 
unsafe way that it can be set up well

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:51.990 
unsafe way that it can be set up well
quite<00:01:50.230> often<00:01:50.440> we<00:01:51.310> might<00:01:51.520> come<00:01:51.700> across<00:01:51.730> a

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:52.000 
quite often we might come across a

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.210 
quite often we might come across a
scenario<00:01:52.570> where<00:01:52.720> somebody's<00:01:53.230> thought<00:01:53.950> about

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:54.220 
scenario where somebody's thought about

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:56.400 
scenario where somebody's thought about
putting<00:01:54.400> the<00:01:54.610> TV<00:01:54.820> as<00:01:54.970> an<00:01:55.120> afterthought<00:01:55.570> so

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:56.410 
putting the TV as an afterthought so

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:58.920 
putting the TV as an afterthought so
you'll<00:01:57.040> see<00:01:57.310> a<00:01:57.580> normal<00:01:58.240> wall<00:01:58.479> with<00:01:58.810> the

00:01:58.920 --> 00:01:58.930 
you'll see a normal wall with the

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:02.040 
you'll see a normal wall with the
fireplace<00:01:59.410> and<00:02:00.330> then<00:02:01.330> they<00:02:01.510> decide<00:02:01.810> that<00:02:01.840> they

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:02.050 
fireplace and then they decide that they

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:04.640 
fireplace and then they decide that they
want<00:02:02.229> to<00:02:02.260> put<00:02:02.350> a<00:02:02.410> TV<00:02:02.620> on<00:02:03.040> top<00:02:04.000> of<00:02:04.150> the<00:02:04.210> fireplace

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:04.650 
want to put a TV on top of the fireplace

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:07.260 
want to put a TV on top of the fireplace
what<00:02:05.650> that<00:02:05.860> means<00:02:06.130> unfortunately<00:02:06.310> most<00:02:07.000> cases

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:07.270 
what that means unfortunately most cases

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:08.850 
what that means unfortunately most cases
is<00:02:07.570> that<00:02:07.750> the<00:02:07.870> TV<00:02:08.080> will<00:02:08.320> be<00:02:08.440> protruding

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:08.860 
is that the TV will be protruding

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:11.910 
is that the TV will be protruding
forward<00:02:09.490> of<00:02:09.789> the<00:02:09.970> fireplace<00:02:10.260> now<00:02:11.260> that<00:02:11.620> can

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:11.920 
forward of the fireplace now that can

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:13.680 
forward of the fireplace now that can
damage<00:02:12.250> the<00:02:12.340> television<00:02:12.790> because<00:02:12.970> you<00:02:13.209> then

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:13.690 
damage the television because you then

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:16.170 
damage the television because you then
have<00:02:13.990> heat<00:02:14.400> accumulating<00:02:15.400> underneath<00:02:15.970> the

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
have heat accumulating underneath the

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:18.300 
have heat accumulating underneath the
actual<00:02:16.480> television<00:02:17.320> coming<00:02:18.070> from<00:02:18.190> the

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 
actual television coming from the

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:21.120 
actual television coming from the
firebox<00:02:18.760> and<00:02:19.709> you<00:02:20.709> don't<00:02:20.890> want<00:02:21.070> that

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:21.130 
firebox and you don't want that

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:23.130 
firebox and you don't want that
obviously<00:02:21.940> going<00:02:22.090> to<00:02:22.150> risk<00:02:22.660> damaging<00:02:23.080> the

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 
obviously going to risk damaging the

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:25.110 
obviously going to risk damaging the
television<00:02:23.650> so<00:02:24.220> then<00:02:24.400> we<00:02:24.640> see<00:02:24.940> other

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120 
television so then we see other

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:27.120 
television so then we see other
scenarios<00:02:25.570> where<00:02:25.750> maybe<00:02:26.350> to<00:02:26.530> get<00:02:26.620> around<00:02:26.890> that

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:27.130 
scenarios where maybe to get around that

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:29.370 
scenarios where maybe to get around that
they'll<00:02:27.310> install<00:02:27.670> a<00:02:27.730> shelf<00:02:28.030> to<00:02:28.570> deflect<00:02:28.989> the

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:29.380 
they'll install a shelf to deflect the

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:31.740 
they'll install a shelf to deflect the
heat<00:02:30.190> away<00:02:30.400> from<00:02:30.610> the<00:02:30.940> TV<00:02:31.120> and<00:02:31.420> the<00:02:31.480> shelf

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
heat away from the TV and the shelf

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:33.240 
heat away from the TV and the shelf
would<00:02:31.870> have<00:02:32.080> to<00:02:32.170> be<00:02:32.260> a<00:02:32.290> non<00:02:32.440> combustible<00:02:32.739> shelf

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250 
would have to be a non combustible shelf

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:36.720 
would have to be a non combustible shelf
so<00:02:33.400> something<00:02:33.700> like<00:02:33.730> some<00:02:34.690> stone<00:02:35.350> marble

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
so something like some stone marble

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:39.570 
so something like some stone marble
as<00:02:37.629> long<00:02:37.870> as<00:02:37.900> it's<00:02:38.140> adequate<00:02:38.379> enough<00:02:38.680> is<00:02:38.890> the

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:39.580 
as long as it's adequate enough is the

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:42.420 
as long as it's adequate enough is the
actual<00:02:39.879> shop<00:02:40.060> itself<00:02:40.450> damaged<00:02:41.440> Eva<00:02:41.620> but<00:02:42.250> we're
