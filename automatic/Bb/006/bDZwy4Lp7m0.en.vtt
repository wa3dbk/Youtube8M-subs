go drop by drop you can add a very very
thin<00:04:00.280> stream<00:04:00.850> of<00:04:01.110> the<00:04:02.110> oil<00:04:02.320> and<00:04:03.270> then<00:04:04.270> with<00:04:04.540> it

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:04.720 
thin stream of the oil and then with it

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:06.660 
thin stream of the oil and then with it
back<00:04:04.960> in<00:04:05.230> that<00:04:05.620> makes<00:04:05.830> the<00:04:06.010> process<00:04:06.250> go<00:04:06.640> a

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:06.670 
back in that makes the process go a

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:08.970 
back in that makes the process go a
little<00:04:06.940> bit<00:04:07.180> faster<00:04:07.690> but<00:04:07.870> only<00:04:08.170> do<00:04:08.590> thin

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:08.980 
little bit faster but only do thin

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:12.780 
little bit faster but only do thin
streams<00:04:10.080> once<00:04:11.080> you're<00:04:11.290> certain<00:04:11.950> that<00:04:12.610> your

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:12.790 
streams once you're certain that your

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:15.210 
streams once you're certain that your
emulsion<00:04:13.360> is<00:04:13.540> coming<00:04:13.960> together<00:04:14.110> to<00:04:14.590> form<00:04:14.830> this

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:15.220 
emulsion is coming together to form this

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:17.640 
emulsion is coming together to form this
solid<00:04:15.910> this<00:04:16.630> is<00:04:16.810> also<00:04:17.109> the<00:04:17.200> point<00:04:17.440> where<00:04:17.560> you

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:17.650 
solid this is also the point where you

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:19.500 
solid this is also the point where you
start<00:04:17.920> to<00:04:18.040> notice<00:04:18.220> that<00:04:18.430> the<00:04:18.580> smells<00:04:18.940> just

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:19.510 
start to notice that the smells just

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:21.780 
start to notice that the smells just
like<00:04:19.780> the<00:04:19.989> jar<00:04:20.260> mayonnaise<00:04:20.739> only<00:04:21.549> the<00:04:21.640> good

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:25.480 
news is there no preservatives what

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:27.210 
news is there no preservatives what
sometimes<00:04:25.840> happens<00:04:26.590> is<00:04:26.800> that<00:04:26.890> the<00:04:27.010> mayonnaise

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:27.220 
sometimes happens is that the mayonnaise

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:29.310 
sometimes happens is that the mayonnaise
thickens<00:04:27.910> up<00:04:28.030> even<00:04:28.390> more<00:04:28.540> quickly<00:04:28.900> than<00:04:29.140> you'd

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:29.320 
thickens up even more quickly than you'd

mayonnaise<00:04:32.350> but<00:04:32.590> I've<00:04:32.680> only<00:04:32.920> added<00:04:33.160> half<00:04:34.060> of

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:34.270 
mayonnaise but I've only added half of

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:36.510 
mayonnaise but I've only added half of
the<00:04:34.390> oil<00:04:34.420> and<00:04:35.200> I<00:04:35.560> really<00:04:35.860> can't<00:04:36.070> whisk<00:04:36.340> it

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:36.520 
the oil and I really can't whisk it

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:38.490 
the oil and I really can't whisk it
anymore<00:04:36.910> because<00:04:37.180> it's<00:04:37.450> too<00:04:37.630> thick<00:04:37.930> no

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:38.500 
anymore because it's too thick no

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:40.500 
anymore because it's too thick no
problem<00:04:39.070> just<00:04:39.490> add<00:04:39.700> a<00:04:39.730> little<00:04:39.910> bit<00:04:40.060> of<00:04:40.180> water

to<00:04:40.810> thin<00:04:41.020> it<00:04:41.230> out<00:04:41.440> so<00:04:41.680> that<00:04:41.710> you<00:04:41.860> can<00:04:42.070> whisk<00:04:42.280> it

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:42.430 
to thin it out so that you can whisk it

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:44.400
