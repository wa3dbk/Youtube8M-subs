easy basically just go into any game

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.579 
easy basically just go into any game
mode<00:01:02.250> you<00:01:02.280> want<00:01:02.899> doesn't<00:01:03.899> matter<00:01:04.170> what<00:01:04.439> game

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
mode you want doesn't matter what game

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.219 
mode you want doesn't matter what game
mode<00:01:04.799> it<00:01:04.920> is<00:01:05.540> the<00:01:06.540> only<00:01:06.689> one<00:01:06.900> that<00:01:07.080> would<00:01:07.170> be

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
mode it is the only one that would be

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.210 
mode it is the only one that would be
trouble<00:01:07.830> is<00:01:08.010> uh<00:01:08.570> game<00:01:09.570> mode<00:01:09.869> where<00:01:10.530> the

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
trouble is uh game mode where the

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.000 
trouble is uh game mode where the
weapons<00:01:11.610> rotate<00:01:12.409> that<00:01:13.409> might<00:01:13.619> be<00:01:13.770> a<00:01:13.799> little

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
weapons rotate that might be a little

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.100 
weapons rotate that might be a little
bit<00:01:14.130> harder<00:01:14.400> but<00:01:14.640> basically<00:01:15.360> what<00:01:15.600> you<00:01:15.689> do<00:01:15.810> is

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
bit harder but basically what you do is

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.620 
bit harder but basically what you do is
you<00:01:17.040> just<00:01:17.220> go<00:01:17.400> around<00:01:17.670> killing<00:01:17.909> anyone<00:01:18.360> you

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
you just go around killing anyone you

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.890 
you just go around killing anyone you
kill<00:01:18.810> everyone<00:01:19.080> you<00:01:19.229> kill<00:01:19.439> anyone<00:01:19.770> um<00:01:20.040> and

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:20.900 
kill everyone you kill anyone um and

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:23.840 
kill everyone you kill anyone um and
walk<00:01:21.900> over<00:01:21.930> their<00:01:22.320> gun<00:01:22.590> and<00:01:22.860> if<00:01:23.490> it's<00:01:23.700> the

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
walk over their gun and if it's the

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.670 
walk over their gun and if it's the
peacekeeper<00:01:24.420> pretty<00:01:24.869> much<00:01:25.020> all<00:01:25.320> you<00:01:25.500> have<00:01:25.590> to

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
peacekeeper pretty much all you have to

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.350 
peacekeeper pretty much all you have to
do<00:01:25.799> is<00:01:25.950> pick<00:01:26.130> it<00:01:26.189> up<00:01:26.369> and<00:01:26.549> now<00:01:26.700> that<00:01:26.970> gun<00:01:27.150> is

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
do is pick it up and now that gun is

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.100 
do is pick it up and now that gun is
yours<00:01:28.280> it's<00:01:29.280> a<00:01:29.430> really<00:01:29.790> simple<00:01:30.119> concept<00:01:30.540> but

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
yours it's a really simple concept but

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.170 
yours it's a really simple concept but
to<00:01:31.829> be<00:01:31.920> honest<00:01:32.159> I<00:01:32.250> think<00:01:32.610> I'm<00:01:32.820> the<00:01:33.030> first

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
to be honest I think I'm the first

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.649 
to be honest I think I'm the first
person<00:01:33.630> to<00:01:33.659> think<00:01:34.320> about<00:01:34.500> it<00:01:34.680> um<00:01:34.970> it's<00:01:35.970> super

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
person to think about it um it's super

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:39.080 
person to think about it um it's super
it's<00:01:37.409> a<00:01:37.560> really<00:01:37.770> easy<00:01:37.799> way<00:01:38.220> to<00:01:38.250> test<00:01:38.759> out<00:01:38.939> the

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
it's a really easy way to test out the

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.670 
it's a really easy way to test out the
gun<00:01:39.240> before<00:01:39.600> you<00:01:39.780> decide<00:01:40.110> whether<00:01:40.290> or<00:01:40.409> not<00:01:40.560> you

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
gun before you decide whether or not you

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.370 
gun before you decide whether or not you
want<00:01:40.829> to<00:01:40.890> buy<00:01:41.009> it<00:01:41.070> and<00:01:41.810> in<00:01:42.810> order<00:01:43.020> to<00:01:43.110> get<00:01:43.259> the

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
want to buy it and in order to get the

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.639 
want to buy it and in order to get the
gun<00:01:43.530> I<00:01:43.649> believe<00:01:43.890> you<00:01:43.979> have<00:01:44.100> to<00:01:44.159> buy<00:01:44.340> the<00:01:44.450> $14

00:01:45.639 --> 00:01:45.649

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:48.819 
gun I believe you have to buy the $14
14.99<00:01:46.649> revolution<00:01:47.490> pack<00:01:47.790> or<00:01:48.000> whatever<00:01:48.240> and

00:01:48.819 --> 00:01:48.829 
14.99 revolution pack or whatever and

00:01:48.829 --> 00:01:53.300 
14.99 revolution pack or whatever and
not<00:01:49.829> everyone<00:01:50.130> has<00:01:50.280> $14<00:01:51.030> so<00:01:51.479> pretty<00:01:52.350> much<00:01:52.500> if

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
not everyone has $14 so pretty much if

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:54.859 
not everyone has $14 so pretty much if
you're<00:01:53.579> considering<00:01:54.000> buying<00:01:54.149> it<00:01:54.390> why<00:01:54.810> don't

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:51.250 
combat training to just run around and

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:53.500 
combat training to just run around and
not<00:03:52.250> have<00:03:52.430> to<00:03:52.580> worry<00:03:52.730> about<00:03:52.790> being<00:03:53.239> killed

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:53.510
