reminded me of the work that scientists

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:10.559 
reminded me of the work that scientists
do<00:02:08.539> in<00:02:08.690> the<00:02:08.840> way<00:02:09.050> that<00:02:09.590> scientists<00:02:10.099> think

00:02:10.559 --> 00:02:10.569 
do in the way that scientists think

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:14.080 
do in the way that scientists think
she's<00:02:11.569> constantly<00:02:12.230> exploring<00:02:13.160> trying<00:02:14.030> to

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
she's constantly exploring trying to

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:16.330 
she's constantly exploring trying to
make<00:02:14.269> sense<00:02:14.630> of<00:02:14.930> the<00:02:15.080> world<00:02:15.230> around<00:02:15.470> her<00:02:15.920> ever

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:16.340 
make sense of the world around her ever

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:17.970 
make sense of the world around her ever
since<00:02:16.610> I<00:02:16.849> was<00:02:17.060> a<00:02:17.120> little<00:02:17.300> girl<00:02:17.540> I<00:02:17.930> always

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
since I was a little girl I always

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:21.670 
since I was a little girl I always
wanted<00:02:18.980> to<00:02:19.220> collect<00:02:19.780> science<00:02:20.780> objects<00:02:21.500> and

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680 
wanted to collect science objects and

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:24.699 
wanted to collect science objects and
try<00:02:22.130> to<00:02:22.190> figure<00:02:22.489> out<00:02:22.670> why<00:02:23.540> they<00:02:24.019> were<00:02:24.080> the<00:02:24.560> way

00:02:24.699 --> 00:02:24.709 
try to figure out why they were the way

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:27.670 
try to figure out why they were the way
they<00:02:24.739> were<00:02:25.010> and<00:02:25.580> to<00:02:26.030> me<00:02:26.269> I<00:02:26.629> think<00:02:27.019> that's<00:02:27.379> what

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:27.680 
they were and to me I think that's what

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:30.490 
they were and to me I think that's what
a<00:02:27.890> scientist<00:02:28.430> is<00:02:28.670> is<00:02:29.000> someone<00:02:29.390> who<00:02:29.690> is<00:02:29.930> really

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:30.500 
a scientist is is someone who is really

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:33.009 
a scientist is is someone who is really
curious<00:02:31.069> about<00:02:31.370> the<00:02:31.700> world<00:02:31.730> around<00:02:32.299> them<00:02:32.750> and

00:02:33.009 --> 00:02:33.019 
curious about the world around them and

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:40.630 
curious about the world around them and
why<00:02:33.890> it<00:02:33.950> is<00:02:34.340> the<00:02:35.000> way<00:02:35.030> it<00:02:35.480> is<00:02:38.920> do<00:02:39.920> you<00:02:40.099> think<00:02:40.459> you

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:40.640 
why it is the way it is do you think you

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:43.350 
why it is the way it is do you think you
need<00:02:40.910> to<00:02:41.090> step<00:02:41.390> into<00:02:41.660> scientist<00:02:42.440> shoes<00:02:42.769> I

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:43.360 
need to step into scientist shoes I

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:47.410 
need to step into scientist shoes I
don't<00:02:44.360> think<00:02:44.630> so<00:02:44.870> because<00:02:45.910> you're<00:02:46.910> already

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:47.420 
don't think so because you're already

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:52.809 
don't think so because you're already
wearing<00:02:47.870> scientist<00:02:48.680> shoes<00:02:51.670> science<00:02:52.670> is

00:02:52.809 --> 00:02:52.819 
wearing scientist shoes science is

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:54.490 
wearing scientist shoes science is
definitely<00:02:53.360> something<00:02:53.599> that's<00:02:53.840> universal

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:54.500 
definitely something that's universal

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:56.020 
definitely something that's universal
it's<00:02:54.709> something<00:02:55.010> that<00:02:55.190> everybody<00:02:55.760> can<00:02:55.940> get

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.030 
it's something that everybody can get

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:58.420 
it's something that everybody can get
engaged<00:02:56.390> in<00:02:56.630> kids<00:02:56.900> especially<00:02:57.250> really<00:02:58.250> want

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:58.430 
engaged in kids especially really want

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:59.620 
engaged in kids especially really want
to<00:02:58.489> learn<00:02:58.610> it<00:02:58.790> they<00:02:58.910> really<00:02:59.120> want<00:02:59.299> to<00:02:59.360> do<00:02:59.480> it

00:02:59.620 --> 00:02:59.630 
to learn it they really want to do it

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:01.059 
to learn it they really want to do it
they<00:02:59.900> really<00:03:00.049> want<00:03:00.319> to<00:03:00.380> try<00:03:00.590> it<00:03:00.620> they<00:03:00.889> want<00:03:01.010> to

00:03:01.059 --> 00:03:01.069 
they really want to try it they want to

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:03.280 
they really want to try it they want to
get<00:03:01.130> their<00:03:01.190> hands<00:03:01.609> into<00:03:02.000> what's<00:03:02.630> going<00:03:02.900> on<00:03:03.079> so

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:03.290 
get their hands into what's going on so

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:04.990 
get their hands into what's going on so
that<00:03:03.380> they<00:03:03.500> can<00:03:03.650> truly<00:03:03.950> understand<00:03:04.459> it<00:03:04.670> if

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:05.000 
that they can truly understand it if

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.309 
that they can truly understand it if
they<00:03:05.150> walk<00:03:05.329> away<00:03:05.569> like<00:03:05.840> certain<00:03:06.139> basic

00:03:06.309 --> 00:03:06.319 
they walk away like certain basic

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:08.140 
they walk away like certain basic
concepts<00:03:06.920> or<00:03:07.190> knowing<00:03:07.400> certain<00:03:07.700> words<00:03:07.880> it's

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:08.150 
concepts or knowing certain words it's

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:10.800 
concepts or knowing certain words it's
great<00:03:08.510> but<00:03:08.750> if<00:03:08.840> they<00:03:08.959> just<00:03:09.139> walk<00:03:09.380> away<00:03:09.609> going

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:10.810 
great but if they just walk away going

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:14.670 
great but if they just walk away going
science<00:03:11.810> is<00:03:12.109> fun<00:03:12.430> sciences<00:03:13.450> science<00:03:14.450> and

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:14.680 
science is fun sciences science and

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:16.750 
science is fun sciences science and
interesting<00:03:15.680> I'm<00:03:15.889> gonna<00:03:16.160> have<00:03:16.340> to<00:03:16.459> look<00:03:16.609> into

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:16.760 
interesting I'm gonna have to look into

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:18.520 
interesting I'm gonna have to look into
this<00:03:16.970> science<00:03:17.299> stuff<00:03:17.359> then<00:03:17.780> I<00:03:17.989> feel<00:03:18.170> like<00:03:18.290> I

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:18.530 
this science stuff then I feel like I

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:20.250 
this science stuff then I feel like I
did<00:03:18.889> my<00:03:19.010> job

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:20.260 
did my job

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.319 
did my job
