update on my Kalia orchids because I

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:06.920 
update on my Kalia orchids because I

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:06.930 
didn't talk about them for some time

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:09.259 
didn't talk about them for some time
right<00:00:07.140> now<00:00:07.319> and<00:00:07.620> I<00:00:08.160> just<00:00:08.189> remembered<00:00:08.849> I<00:00:09.059> didn't

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:09.269 
right now and I just remembered I didn't

link<00:00:09.480> you<00:00:09.570> to<00:00:09.599> the<00:00:10.110> online<00:00:10.230> store<00:00:10.830> that<00:00:11.219> I

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670 
link you to the online store that I

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:13.700 
link you to the online store that I
bought<00:00:11.910> them<00:00:12.059> from<00:00:12.240> it's<00:00:12.840> a<00:00:12.960> store<00:00:13.139> in<00:00:13.259> Germany

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
bought them from it's a store in Germany

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:15.890 
bought them from it's a store in Germany
so<00:00:13.980> maybe<00:00:14.309> people<00:00:14.670> from<00:00:15.059> Europe<00:00:15.360> would<00:00:15.509> will

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
so maybe people from Europe would will

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.490 
so maybe people from Europe would will
find<00:00:16.350> it<00:00:16.500> useful<00:00:16.850> I<00:00:17.850> find<00:00:18.510> the<00:00:18.810> prices<00:00:19.260> to<00:00:19.380> be

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
find it useful I find the prices to be

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.859 
find it useful I find the prices to be
very<00:00:19.830> good<00:00:20.130> for<00:00:20.460> the<00:00:20.760> actual<00:00:21.090> plans<00:00:21.359> which<00:00:21.689> are

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
very good for the actual plans which are

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:24.200 
very good for the actual plans which are
mature<00:00:22.320> and<00:00:22.529> healthy<00:00:22.980> so<00:00:23.250> you<00:00:23.760> don't<00:00:23.939> have<00:00:24.029> to

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
mature and healthy so you don't have to

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.240 
mature and healthy so you don't have to
wait<00:00:24.330> for<00:00:24.359> years<00:00:24.900> for<00:00:25.350> it<00:00:25.470> to<00:00:25.500> bloom<00:00:25.859> they're

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
wait for years for it to bloom they're

wait for years for it to bloom they're
not<00:00:26.430> siblings<00:00:27.349> transport<00:00:28.349> is<00:00:28.560> rather<00:00:28.980> long<00:00:29.490> it

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
not siblings transport is rather long it

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:32.860 
not siblings transport is rather long it
took<00:00:30.150> 10<00:00:30.390> days<00:00:30.630> to<00:00:30.929> arrive<00:00:31.170> to<00:00:31.410> Romania<00:00:31.830> but

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:32.870 
took 10 days to arrive to Romania but

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:36.410 
took 10 days to arrive to Romania but
plants<00:00:33.870> like<00:00:34.050> vandals<00:00:34.890> work<00:00:35.040> at<00:00:35.280> leas<00:00:35.579> they<00:00:36.090> do

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
plants like vandals work at leas they do

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.680 
plants like vandals work at leas they do
tend<00:00:36.750> to<00:00:37.309> handle<00:00:38.309> transport<00:00:39.000> very<00:00:39.239> very<00:00:39.510> well

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
tend to handle transport very very well

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.209 
tend to handle transport very very well
I<00:00:39.840> didn't<00:00:40.140> have<00:00:40.260> any<00:00:40.440> problems<00:00:40.920> so<00:00:41.730> ok<00:00:42.860> this<00:00:43.860> is

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
I didn't have any problems so ok this is

have I got from the store it had two
rather<00:00:52.620> small<00:00:53.399> pseudobulbs<00:00:54.120> which<00:00:54.329> now<00:00:54.539> grew

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:55.190 
rather small pseudobulbs which now grew

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:58.639 
rather small pseudobulbs which now grew
considerably<00:00:56.190> in<00:00:56.850> a<00:00:57.239> very<00:00:57.480> tiny<00:00:57.780> one<00:00:58.109> which<00:00:58.469> is

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
considerably in a very tiny one which is

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.229 
considerably in a very tiny one which is
also<00:00:58.859> growing<00:00:59.640> nicely

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
also growing nicely

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.020 
also growing nicely
she's<00:01:00.899> also<00:01:01.050> putting<00:01:01.379> out<00:01:01.530> new<00:01:01.770> roots<00:01:02.070> so<00:01:02.520> this

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
she's also putting out new roots so this

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.859 
she's also putting out new roots so this
is<00:01:03.290> really<00:01:04.290> good<00:01:04.979> news<00:01:05.479> I'm<00:01:06.479> not<00:01:06.659> sure<00:01:06.780> if

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
is really good news I'm not sure if

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:08.210 
is really good news I'm not sure if
she's<00:01:07.049> got<00:01:07.229> a<00:01:07.260> bloom<00:01:07.590> actually<00:01:08.010> this<00:01:08.159> year

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
she's got a bloom actually this year

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.550

because<00:01:08.610> they're<00:01:08.939> blooming<00:01:09.150> period<00:01:09.510> is<00:01:09.900> from

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
because they're blooming period is from

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.230 
because they're blooming period is from
spring<00:01:10.890> to<00:01:10.920> summer<00:01:11.100> or<00:01:11.700> something<00:01:12.090> like<00:01:12.180> that

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
spring to summer or something like that

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:13.969 
spring to summer or something like that
but<00:01:13.110> I<00:01:13.140> don't<00:01:13.409> have<00:01:13.590> that<00:01:13.740> much<00:01:13.860> experience

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
but I don't have that much experience

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.190 
but I don't have that much experience
with<00:01:14.400> Kellie<00:01:14.640> as<00:01:14.850> it<00:01:15.030> might<00:01:15.210> actually<00:01:15.330> bloom<00:01:15.930> I

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
with Kellie as it might actually bloom I

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.080 
with Kellie as it might actually bloom I
don't<00:01:16.650> know<00:01:16.740> how<00:01:16.890> much<00:01:17.100> it<00:01:17.280> takes<00:01:17.460> for<00:01:17.670> a

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
don't know how much it takes for a

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.690 
don't know how much it takes for a
suitable<00:01:18.299> to<00:01:18.659> matures<00:01:18.979> anyway<00:01:19.979> if<00:01:20.220> it<00:01:20.400> blooms

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
suitable to matures anyway if it blooms

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.030 
suitable to matures anyway if it blooms
I<00:01:20.880> will<00:01:21.060> definitely<00:01:21.720> do<00:01:22.140> an<00:01:22.229> update<00:01:22.650> because

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
I will definitely do an update because

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.359 
I will definitely do an update because
the<00:01:23.159> flowers<00:01:23.490> are<00:01:23.909> really<00:01:24.420> really<00:01:24.689> pretty<00:01:25.369> if

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
the flowers are really really pretty if

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:30.190 
the flowers are really really pretty if
you<00:01:26.430> want<00:01:26.670> to<00:01:26.790> google<00:01:27.090> it<00:01:27.650> this<00:01:28.650> is<00:01:28.829> the<00:01:28.979> name

she's not fragrant but I think she

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.010 
she's not fragrant but I think she
compensates<00:01:33.240> with<00:01:33.420> the<00:01:33.509> flowers<00:01:35.329> okay<00:01:36.329> this<00:01:36.780> I

she<00:01:45.119> was<00:01:45.210> sick<00:01:45.479> she<00:01:45.509> didn't<00:01:45.780> have<00:01:45.960> roots<00:01:46.259> but

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
she was sick she didn't have roots but

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.499 
she was sick she didn't have roots but
now<00:01:46.799> she's<00:01:47.159> producing<00:01:47.790> roots<00:01:48.030> and<00:01:48.240> also<00:01:48.479> a

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
now she's producing roots and also a

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.660 
now she's producing roots and also a
tiny<00:01:48.990> little<00:01:49.259> chute<00:01:49.619> here<00:01:49.920> which<00:01:50.399> in<00:01:50.520> my

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
tiny little chute here which in my

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.300 
tiny little chute here which in my
opinion<00:01:50.790> is<00:01:51.329> rather<00:01:51.899> tiny<00:01:52.290> I'm<00:01:52.829> not<00:01:53.070> sure<00:01:53.189> if

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
opinion is rather tiny I'm not sure if

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.929 
opinion is rather tiny I'm not sure if
it<00:01:53.460> will<00:01:53.610> bloom<00:01:53.850> but<00:01:54.750> who<00:01:55.140> knows<00:01:55.670> it's<00:01:56.670> good

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
it will bloom but who knows it's good

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:01.160 
it will bloom but who knows it's good
that<00:01:57.090> she's<00:01:57.329> evolving<00:01:57.810> though<00:01:59.630> this<00:02:00.630> one<00:02:00.899> is

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
that she's evolving though this one is

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.380

properly because the plant is mature and

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:27.270

and I reported her and was forced to

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:42.180 
and I reported her and was forced to
trim<00:02:40.900> all<00:02:41.110> the<00:02:41.320> roots<00:02:41.530> because<00:02:41.830> they<00:02:42.130> were

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:42.190 
trim all the roots because they were

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:44.220 
trim all the roots because they were
dead<00:02:42.520> I'm<00:02:42.790> not<00:02:42.850> sure<00:02:43.360> if<00:02:43.510> it<00:02:43.660> was<00:02:43.840> because<00:02:44.020> of

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:44.230 
dead I'm not sure if it was because of

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:46.440 
dead I'm not sure if it was because of
the<00:02:44.320> transport<00:02:44.920> or<00:02:45.100> because<00:02:46.030> the<00:02:46.150> plant<00:02:46.360> has

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:46.450 
the transport or because the plant has

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:50.250 
the transport or because the plant has
some<00:02:46.750> problems<00:02:47.430> had<00:02:48.430> prior<00:02:48.910> problems<00:02:49.360> but
