00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:05.400
 today you will need beads in 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.170
 first i have sea ​​buckthorn oil here 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.660
 but here I put it so for 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:11.849
 beauty and in fact but I have it 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.610
 there is here in the pharmacy bought or 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:17.670
 I brought little I don’t remember 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:20.250
 the coolest sea ​​buckthorn oil which 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:22.529
 she did one of my grandmothers in 2013 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.430
 years of sea ​​buckthorn oil 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:26.849
 banks 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:30.630
 my mother brought him from Russia to those 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:33.300
 Grandma's business and she gave it all to me 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.739
 This oil gave me a huge wish. 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:38.190
 it's always used there sometimes 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:40.680
 even on the face to remove some cosmetics 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.390
 or just smear and then she always 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.210
 standing in the fridge does not happen china 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:47.250
 same year one helps very well 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.260
 then burdock oil bought it in 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:54.840
 Russia here this time when I went to 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:56.879
 february home then honey ordinary plane 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.020
 will start anyone whom to eat it at all 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:01.440
 no matter what 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:03.899
 and I still have cinnamon here now 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:08.960
 I will show you how I will do all this 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:14.369
 let's start so i take somewhere around 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:17.090
 tablespoon of cinnamon and pour here 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:17.090
 some water 

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:26.530
 Vodicka should be hot idea 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:28.630
 horoshenechko stir cinnamon general 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:31.870
 works very well on hair like 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:34.270
 spice it stimulates their growth because 

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:37.420
 that warms the hair follicles 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:39.190
 she is much softer than yale put 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:42.220
 red pepper or mustard 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:44.970
 another interesting property is night 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:47.410
 lighten the hair so if 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:50.800
 Blondes want to make hair more 

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:54.850
 lighter you can use cinnamon for 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:57.700
 the fact that the eye is flowing hair this 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:02:01.860
 just nice smell bands tight 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:04.900
 before myself here I add honey 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:08.200
 that forcibly my life turned out 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:11.620
 then you can add a spoon because 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:16.720
 that liquid porridge we, too, with you Michelle 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:19.620
 flour need a lot of water water need 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:26.560
 like the line so that you learn from 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:29.800
 This seems like the most important thing is that 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:32.140
 you can’t add cinnamon directly to honey 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:36.700
 because on the lump it will become necessary that 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:40.330
 on time you went so that's what 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:44.170
 concerns wearing cinnamon now i'm putting 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:48.760
 here melodic is my usual flower 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:51.180
 honey, too , somewhere you need Mises coffee 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:54.670
 spoon with a slide 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:59.820
 year stimulates hair too for 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:59.820
 so they even grow it all good 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:14.159
 here on the same begins to even dissolve 

00:03:05.829 --> 00:03:26.129
 and now we will add our oils 

00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:26.129
 so and dust i take the revolt of oil and spoons and 

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:41.169

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:24.230

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:25.940

 you can pass an hour who has there 30 

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:48.890
 or 20 minutes well, okay too, but although 

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:52.970
 20 minutes would have to be like to start 

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:54.200
 acting mask but that's scalp 

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:56.540
