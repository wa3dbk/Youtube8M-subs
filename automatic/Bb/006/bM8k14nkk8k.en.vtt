00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:15.580 
like to see her develop some human

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:17.800

relationships between friends

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:23.870

maybe<00:04:18.810> move<00:04:19.799> away<00:04:20.190> from<00:04:20.459> the<00:04:22.520> original<00:04:23.520> sort

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:23.880

wants to stay in Mystic Falls and she

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:32.690 
wants to stay in Mystic Falls and she
she's<00:04:31.260> lonely<00:04:31.500> and<00:04:31.740> she<00:04:31.950> has<00:04:32.220> been<00:04:32.370> for<00:04:32.430> a<00:04:32.580> long

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:32.700 
she's lonely and she has been for a long

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:35.180 
she's lonely and she has been for a long
time<00:04:32.910> so<00:04:33.120> we'd<00:04:33.450> like<00:04:33.660> to<00:04:33.720> see<00:04:33.990> a<00:04:34.260> little<00:04:34.980> more

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:35.190
