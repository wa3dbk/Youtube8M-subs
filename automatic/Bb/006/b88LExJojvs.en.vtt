like what when we first heard about the

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.709 
like what when we first heard about the
fat<00:00:35.010> acceptance<00:00:35.250> movement<00:00:36.030> I<00:00:36.180> think<00:00:36.600> we<00:00:36.690> all

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
fat acceptance movement I think we all

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:39.080 
fat acceptance movement I think we all
thought<00:00:37.140> it<00:00:37.320> meant<00:00:37.500> that<00:00:37.770> we<00:00:38.399> wanted<00:00:38.730> no<00:00:38.940> one

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
thought it meant that we wanted no one

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.900

to<00:00:39.210> be<00:00:39.329> cruel<00:00:39.629> to<00:00:39.840> anyone<00:00:40.559> at<00:00:40.770> any<00:00:41.190> size<00:00:41.550> and<00:00:41.879> I

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
to be cruel to anyone at any size and I

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.280 
to be cruel to anyone at any size and I
think<00:00:42.090> every<00:00:42.450> one<00:00:42.600> of<00:00:42.719> us<00:00:42.809> would<00:00:43.020> agree<00:00:43.050> to

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
think every one of us would agree to

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.350 
think every one of us would agree to
that<00:00:43.559> but<00:00:43.800> what<00:00:44.219> it's<00:00:44.370> kind<00:00:44.610> of<00:00:44.670> become<00:00:45.120> is

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
that but what it's kind of become is
