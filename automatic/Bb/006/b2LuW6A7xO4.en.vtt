the<00:00:26.939> plx<00:00:27.449> Kiwi<00:00:27.960> Wi-Fi<00:00:28.590> this<00:00:29.039> device<00:00:29.340> is<00:00:29.460> about

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
the plx Kiwi Wi-Fi this device is about

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.700 
the plx Kiwi Wi-Fi this device is about
$150<00:00:30.539> and<00:00:30.689> what<00:00:31.050> it<00:00:31.170> is<00:00:31.260> it's<00:00:31.439> actually<00:00:31.500> a

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
$150 and what it is it's actually a

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.340 
$150 and what it is it's actually a
diagnostic<00:00:32.369> computer<00:00:32.790> for<00:00:33.270> your<00:00:33.390> car<00:00:33.630> so

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
diagnostic computer for your car so

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.680 
diagnostic computer for your car so
basically<00:00:34.680> you'll<00:00:34.980> plug<00:00:35.250> this<00:00:35.460> end<00:00:35.640> here<00:00:36.030> into

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
basically you'll plug this end here into

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.869 
basically you'll plug this end here into
your<00:00:36.750> onboard<00:00:37.530> diagnostic<00:00:38.129> port<00:00:38.280> the<00:00:38.460> OBD

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
your onboard diagnostic port the OBD

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:40.490 
your onboard diagnostic port the OBD
port<00:00:38.910> not<00:00:39.329> to<00:00:39.450> be<00:00:39.540> confused<00:00:39.840> with<00:00:39.989> the<00:00:40.110> ODB

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
port not to be confused with the ODB

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.160 
port not to be confused with the ODB
port<00:00:40.739> and<00:00:41.730> then<00:00:42.120> that<00:00:42.540> will<00:00:42.690> actually<00:00:42.930> power

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
port and then that will actually power

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.080 
port and then that will actually power
this<00:00:43.500> device<00:00:43.770> which<00:00:44.100> basically<00:00:44.520> becomes<00:00:44.940> an

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
this device which basically becomes an

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.080 
this device which basically becomes an
ad-hoc<00:00:45.440> in-car<00:00:46.440> Wi-Fi<00:00:47.160> device<00:00:47.460> now<00:00:47.969> you're

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
ad-hoc in-car Wi-Fi device now you're

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.150 
ad-hoc in-car Wi-Fi device now you're
not<00:00:48.149> actually<00:00:48.450> surfing<00:00:48.870> you're<00:00:49.800> not<00:00:49.920> getting

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
not actually surfing you're not getting

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:51.619 
not actually surfing you're not getting
data<00:00:50.340> or<00:00:50.489> anything<00:00:50.730> like<00:00:50.879> that<00:00:50.910> what<00:00:51.510> you're

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
data or anything like that what you're

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.170 
data or anything like that what you're
really<00:00:51.750> doing<00:00:51.840> is<00:00:52.289> translating<00:00:53.160> the<00:00:53.910> data

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
really doing is translating the data

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:55.819 
really doing is translating the data
that<00:00:54.329> comes<00:00:54.539> out<00:00:54.690> of<00:00:54.780> the<00:00:54.899> onboard<00:00:55.260> diagnostic

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
that comes out of the onboard diagnostic

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.849 
that comes out of the onboard diagnostic
port<00:00:56.120> through<00:00:57.120> Wi-Fi<00:00:57.329> onto<00:00:58.020> your<00:00:58.140> iPhone<00:00:58.530> this

how<00:01:23.009> the<00:01:23.220> speedometer<00:01:23.640> is<00:01:23.700> going<00:01:23.820> to<00:01:23.880> look<00:01:24.030> you

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
how the speedometer is going to look you

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.270 
how the speedometer is going to look you
can<00:01:24.210> look<00:01:24.450> at<00:01:24.540> it<00:01:24.630> in<00:01:24.780> either<00:01:24.900> a<00:01:25.560> vertical<00:01:26.070> or

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
can look at it in either a vertical or

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.749 
can look at it in either a vertical or
horizontal<00:01:26.509> configuration<00:01:28.460> now<00:01:29.460> you<00:01:29.549> can<00:01:29.640> get

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
horizontal configuration now you can get

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:33.590 
horizontal configuration now you can get
data<00:01:29.939> like<00:01:30.030> a<00:01:30.360> fuel<00:01:30.810> trim<00:01:31.170> torque<00:01:32.600> there's

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
data like a fuel trim torque there's

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.050 
data like a fuel trim torque there's
like<00:01:34.170> air<00:01:34.380> pressure<00:01:34.680> all<00:01:35.100> kinds<00:01:35.400> of<00:01:35.549> really

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
like air pressure all kinds of really

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.520 
like air pressure all kinds of really
detailed<00:01:36.299> data<00:01:36.750> so<00:01:36.960> if<00:01:37.079> you're<00:01:37.229> a<00:01:37.259> gearhead

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
detailed data so if you're a gearhead

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.050 
detailed data so if you're a gearhead
something<00:01:38.280> you<00:01:38.369> might<00:01:38.490> really<00:01:38.670> want<00:01:38.880> to<00:01:38.939> take

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
something you might really want to take

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.440 
something you might really want to take
a<00:01:39.090> close<00:01:39.329> look<00:01:39.420> at<00:01:40.280> now<00:01:41.280> onboard<00:01:41.850> diagnostic

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
a close look at now onboard diagnostic

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.749 
a close look at now onboard diagnostic
ports<00:01:42.780> appear<00:01:43.170> in<00:01:43.350> basically<00:01:44.250> every<00:01:44.520> car

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
ports appear in basically every car

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:47.120 
ports appear in basically every car
that's<00:01:45.000> manufactured<00:01:45.479> in<00:01:46.020> 1996<00:01:46.770> or<00:01:46.890> later

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
that's manufactured in 1996 or later

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.600 
that's manufactured in 1996 or later
obviously<00:01:47.460> the<00:01:48.240> higher<00:01:48.810> up<00:01:49.020> on<00:01:49.170> the<00:01:49.579> scale<00:01:50.579> you

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
obviously the higher up on the scale you

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.340 
obviously the higher up on the scale you
go<00:01:50.880> so<00:01:51.060> if<00:01:51.149> you<00:01:51.240> for<00:01:51.509> example<00:01:51.540> buy<00:01:51.930> a<00:01:51.960> luxury

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
go so if you for example buy a luxury

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.160 
go so if you for example buy a luxury
car<00:01:52.649> made<00:01:53.159> in<00:01:53.310> 2010<00:01:54.060> you'll<00:01:54.750> be<00:01:54.869> getting<00:01:55.079> a<00:01:55.140> lot

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
car made in 2010 you'll be getting a lot

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.980
