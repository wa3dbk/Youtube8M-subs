00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
else gets really cool things like crane

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.850 
else gets really cool things like crane
Zords<00:01:36.090> and<00:01:36.270> bear<00:01:36.509> swords<00:01:36.960> and<00:01:37.110> ape<00:01:37.200> swords<00:01:37.680> and

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
Zords and bear swords and ape swords and

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.480 
Zords and bear swords and ape swords and
then<00:01:38.700> he<00:01:38.820> gets<00:01:39.000> no<00:01:39.180> bonus<00:01:39.600> accessory<00:01:40.140> I

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:40.490 
then he gets no bonus accessory I

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:42.710 
then he gets no bonus accessory I
understand<00:01:41.490> he's<00:01:41.759> the<00:01:41.790> only<00:01:42.090> character<00:01:42.390> that

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
understand he's the only character that

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.300 
understand he's the only character that
didn't<00:01:43.079> debut<00:01:43.439> a<00:01:43.470> new<00:01:43.560> power<00:01:43.829> in<00:01:43.979> the<00:01:44.070> movie

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
didn't debut a new power in the movie

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:45.830 
didn't debut a new power in the movie
but<00:01:44.850> it<00:01:45.090> would<00:01:45.270> have<00:01:45.329> been<00:01:45.450> cool<00:01:45.659> if<00:01:45.750> they

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
but it would have been cool if they

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.270 
but it would have been cool if they
could<00:01:45.990> have<00:01:46.110> included<00:01:46.290> something<00:01:46.740> for<00:01:47.070> him<00:01:47.159> he

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
could have included something for him he

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:48.950 
could have included something for him he
didn't<00:01:47.579> use<00:01:47.700> the<00:01:47.850> power<00:01:48.119> axe<00:01:48.450> in<00:01:48.630> the<00:01:48.659> movie

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
didn't use the power axe in the movie

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.620 
didn't use the power axe in the movie
but<00:01:49.409> even<00:01:49.649> just<00:01:49.799> a<00:01:49.920> retooled<00:01:50.880> power<00:01:51.149> axe

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
but even just a retooled power axe

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.690 
but even just a retooled power axe
would<00:01:51.930> have<00:01:52.020> been<00:01:52.110> a<00:01:52.170> great<00:01:52.409> accessory<00:01:52.740> just

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
would have been a great accessory just

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.399 
would have been a great accessory just
to<00:01:53.820> feel<00:01:54.060> like<00:01:54.329> you<00:01:54.869> got<00:01:55.020> a<00:01:55.049> little<00:01:55.200> extra
