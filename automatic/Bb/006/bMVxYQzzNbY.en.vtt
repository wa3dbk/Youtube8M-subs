what we need is the funding to take this
knowledge<00:02:01.690> from<00:02:02.690> the<00:02:02.750> laboratory<00:02:03.140> in

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:03.650 
knowledge from the laboratory in

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:10.380 
knowledge from the laboratory in
spinning

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:10.390 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:16.440 

good

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:18.809 

so<00:02:17.140> my<00:02:17.379> objective<00:02:17.530> is<00:02:18.069> to<00:02:18.340> cure<00:02:18.550> this<00:02:18.760> disease

00:02:18.809 --> 00:02:18.819 
so my objective is to cure this disease

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:20.640 
so my objective is to cure this disease
or<00:02:19.510> at<00:02:19.750> least<00:02:19.900> get<00:02:20.050> an<00:02:20.170> effective<00:02:20.379> treatment

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650 
or at least get an effective treatment

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:25.199 
or at least get an effective treatment
before<00:02:21.069> I<00:02:21.280> retire<00:02:21.810> which<00:02:22.810> is<00:02:23.400> well<00:02:24.400> not<00:02:25.000> too

00:02:25.199 --> 00:02:25.209 
before I retire which is well not too

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:36.770 
before I retire which is well not too
long<00:02:25.390> away<00:02:25.569> so<00:02:26.260> I<00:02:26.560> think<00:02:26.680> there<00:02:26.980> is<00:02:27.099> hope

there<00:02:37.780> are<00:02:37.900> some<00:02:38.020> days<00:02:38.320> when<00:02:38.620> we're<00:02:38.800> just<00:02:38.950> so

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:39.070 
there are some days when we're just so

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:41.520 
there are some days when we're just so
full<00:02:39.220> of<00:02:39.340> despair<00:02:39.550> that<00:02:40.200> we<00:02:41.200> can't<00:02:41.410> really

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:41.530 
full of despair that we can't really

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:44.490 
full of despair that we can't really
function<00:02:42.480> and<00:02:43.480> it's<00:02:43.630> the<00:02:43.750> hope<00:02:43.900> that<00:02:44.140> keeps<00:02:44.380> us

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500 
function and it's the hope that keeps us

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:46.830 
function and it's the hope that keeps us
going<00:02:45.000> the<00:02:46.000> hope<00:02:46.150> that<00:02:46.180> there<00:02:46.510> will<00:02:46.630> be<00:02:46.690> a
