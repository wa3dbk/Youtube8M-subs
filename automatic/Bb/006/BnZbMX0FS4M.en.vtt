go<00:00:27.150> for<00:00:27.359> this<00:00:27.449> ten<00:00:27.720> pool<00:00:27.990> play<00:00:28.289> I<00:00:28.500> think<00:00:28.920> that

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
go for this ten pool play I think that

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.990 
go for this ten pool play I think that
uh<00:00:29.330> there's<00:00:30.330> this<00:00:30.420> best<00:00:30.869> of<00:00:31.050> X<00:00:31.380> logic<00:00:32.070> that

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
uh there's this best of X logic that

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.850 
uh there's this best of X logic that
ends<00:00:33.329> up<00:00:33.390> coming<00:00:33.780> up<00:00:33.870> very<00:00:34.050> frequently<00:00:34.620> in

this<00:00:35.190> position<00:00:35.760> I<00:00:36.890> don't<00:00:37.890> think<00:00:38.070> there's<00:00:38.219> a

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
this position I don't think there's a

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.549 
this position I don't think there's a
lot<00:00:38.579> of<00:00:38.640> relevance<00:00:39.300> to<00:00:39.480> the<00:00:39.570> fact<00:00:39.809> that<00:00:39.930> neste

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
lot of relevance to the fact that neste

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:43.940

the same build you can also even click

the same build you can also even click
on<00:02:36.480> the<00:02:36.569> gas<00:02:36.750> geyser<00:02:37.080> and<00:02:37.290> see<00:02:37.410> exactly<00:02:37.500> how

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
on the gas geyser and see exactly how

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:39.979 
on the gas geyser and see exactly how
much<00:02:38.010> gas<00:02:38.370> the<00:02:38.760> enemy<00:02:39.090> has<00:02:39.269> mind<00:02:39.599> then<00:02:39.900> you

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:39.989 
much gas the enemy has mind then you

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:42.710 
much gas the enemy has mind then you
know<00:02:40.140> when<00:02:40.470> it<00:02:40.620> went<00:02:40.890> down<00:02:41.069> so<00:02:41.670> both<00:02:42.390> players

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
know when it went down so both players

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:44.630 
know when it went down so both players
are<00:02:42.930> deeply<00:02:43.440> aware<00:02:43.560> of<00:02:43.739> what<00:02:44.010> is<00:02:44.099> going<00:02:44.160> down

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 
are deeply aware of what is going down

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:47.170 
are deeply aware of what is going down
and<00:02:44.970> again<00:02:45.209> it's<00:02:45.510> that<00:02:45.660> expected<00:02:46.530> question

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:47.180 
and again it's that expected question

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:49.160 
and again it's that expected question
both<00:02:48.180> players<00:02:48.420> going<00:02:48.660> to<00:02:48.750> be<00:02:48.840> getting<00:02:49.079> the

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
both players going to be getting the

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:52.250 
both players going to be getting the
speed<00:02:49.500> but<00:02:50.329> will<00:02:51.329> they<00:02:51.480> do<00:02:51.540> the<00:02:51.690> defensive

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
speed but will they do the defensive

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.410 
speed but will they do the defensive
baneling<00:02:52.680> play<00:02:52.890> or<00:02:53.099> decide<00:02:53.670> to<00:02:53.819> do<00:02:53.940> the<00:02:54.060> high

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
baneling play or decide to do the high

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:57.020 
baneling play or decide to do the high
dling<00:02:54.780> play<00:02:55.049> yep<00:02:55.890> it's<00:02:56.160> a<00:02:56.700> good<00:02:56.849> question

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
dling play yep it's a good question

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:59.479 
dling play yep it's a good question
there<00:02:57.840> is<00:02:57.930> also<00:02:58.079> the<00:02:58.349> other<00:02:58.680> option<00:02:59.160> of<00:02:59.310> going

00:02:59.479 --> 00:02:59.489 
there is also the other option of going

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:01.339 
there is also the other option of going
for<00:02:59.849> a<00:02:59.879> very<00:03:00.209> very<00:03:00.540> quick<00:03:00.750> roach<00:03:00.959> warm<00:03:01.200> before

00:04:07.729 --> 00:04:07.739 
this is actually kind of an interesting

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:10.729 
this is actually kind of an interesting
situation<00:04:08.239> ordinarily<00:04:09.239> what<00:04:09.930> neste<00:04:10.290> is<00:04:10.410> doing

00:04:10.729 --> 00:04:10.739 
situation ordinarily what neste is doing

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:12.890 
situation ordinarily what neste is doing
going<00:04:11.609> for<00:04:11.730> that<00:04:11.819> very<00:04:12.030> early<00:04:12.120> Roach<00:04:12.510> Warren

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:12.900 
going for that very early Roach Warren

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:15.259 
going for that very early Roach Warren
will<00:04:13.319> be<00:04:13.440> considered<00:04:13.889> a<00:04:13.980> sort<00:04:14.220> of<00:04:14.310> a<00:04:14.370> slightly

00:04:15.259 --> 00:04:15.269 
will be considered a sort of a slightly

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:17.569 
will be considered a sort of a slightly
unusual<00:04:15.560> defensive<00:04:16.560> play

00:04:17.569 --> 00:04:17.579 
unusual defensive play

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:21.020 
unusual defensive play
but<00:04:18.419> we<00:04:18.750> seem<00:04:18.989> st<00:04:19.549> hiding<00:04:20.549> it<00:04:20.669> in<00:04:20.759> the<00:04:20.849> back

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:21.030 
but we seem st hiding it in the back

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:23.899 
but we seem st hiding it in the back
that<00:04:21.329> is<00:04:21.750> almost<00:04:21.870> always<00:04:22.199> a<00:04:22.409> sign<00:04:22.800> that<00:04:23.129> he<00:04:23.789> is

00:04:23.899 --> 00:04:23.909 
that is almost always a sign that he is

00:04:23.909 --> 00:04:25.700 
that is almost always a sign that he is
going<00:04:24.090> to<00:04:24.210> be<00:04:24.270> going<00:04:24.539> for<00:04:24.840> some<00:04:25.080> sort<00:04:25.259> of<00:04:25.319> large

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:25.710 
going to be going for some sort of large

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:28.700 
going to be going for some sort of large
aggressive<00:04:26.219> attack<00:04:26.490> there<00:04:26.939> are<00:04:27.349> the<00:04:28.349> roaches

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:28.710 
aggressive attack there are the roaches

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:30.170 
aggressive attack there are the roaches
going<00:04:28.919> down<00:04:29.069> see<00:04:29.250> those<00:04:29.370> two<00:04:29.550> geysers<00:04:30.030> that

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:30.180 
going down see those two geysers that

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:31.939 
going down see those two geysers that
were<00:04:30.270> built<00:04:30.419> with<00:04:30.569> the<00:04:30.629> natural<00:04:30.810> expansion<00:04:31.319> he

00:04:31.939 --> 00:04:31.949 
were built with the natural expansion he

00:04:31.949 --> 00:04:33.770 
were built with the natural expansion he
wanted<00:04:32.460> his<00:04:32.580> opponent<00:04:33.000> to<00:04:33.060> see<00:04:33.210> him<00:04:33.330> so<00:04:33.479> he<00:04:33.599> can

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:33.780 
wanted his opponent to see him so he can

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:35.749 
wanted his opponent to see him so he can
cancel<00:04:34.229> it<00:04:34.349> just<00:04:34.560> like<00:04:34.680> that<00:04:34.710> nice<00:04:35.460> little

00:04:35.749 --> 00:04:35.759 
cancel it just like that nice little

00:04:35.759 --> 00:04:37.580 
cancel it just like that nice little
play<00:04:36.030> from<00:04:36.240> neste<00:04:36.569> he's<00:04:36.750> very<00:04:37.020> clearly<00:04:37.349> going

wings and build a couple of banelings
which<00:04:44.460> is<00:04:44.610> the<00:04:44.729> opposite<00:04:45.330> of<00:04:45.419> what<00:04:45.599> he<00:04:45.629> needs

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:45.900 
which is the opposite of what he needs

which is the opposite of what he needs
to<00:04:46.050> be<00:04:46.139> doing<00:04:46.409> right<00:04:46.560> now<00:04:46.620> it<00:04:46.889> needs<00:04:46.979> to<00:04:47.129> be

00:04:47.209 --> 00:04:47.219 
to be doing right now it needs to be

00:04:47.219 --> 00:04:49.189 
to be doing right now it needs to be
throwing<00:04:47.550> down<00:04:47.699> some<00:04:47.729> heavy<00:04:48.150> duty<00:04:48.449> or<00:04:48.719> defense

00:04:49.189 --> 00:04:49.199 
throwing down some heavy duty or defense

00:04:49.199 --> 00:04:51.110 
throwing down some heavy duty or defense
I<00:04:49.409> mean<00:04:50.219> is<00:04:50.340> nesting<00:04:50.639> really<00:04:50.819> going<00:04:50.940> to<00:04:51.030> take

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:51.120 
I mean is nesting really going to take

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:53.570 
I mean is nesting really going to take
the<00:04:51.240> series<00:04:51.419> 222<00:04:51.870> having<00:04:52.469> done<00:04:52.680> basically<00:04:53.099> for

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:53.580 
the series 222 having done basically for

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:56.149 
the series 222 having done basically for
all<00:04:53.819> inish<00:04:54.180> attacks<00:04:55.080> I<00:04:55.349> don't<00:04:55.530> know<00:04:55.650> I<00:04:55.680> mean

00:04:56.149 --> 00:04:56.159 
all inish attacks I don't know I mean

00:04:56.159 --> 00:04:58.879 
all inish attacks I don't know I mean
like<00:04:56.430> if<00:04:57.389> this<00:04:57.719> T<00:04:57.930> was<00:04:58.080> this<00:04:58.259> easy<00:04:58.500> for<00:04:58.770> me<00:04:58.860> to

00:04:58.879 --> 00:04:58.889 
like if this T was this easy for me to

00:04:58.889 --> 00:05:00.469 
like if this T was this easy for me to
read<00:04:59.219> in<00:04:59.430> terms<00:04:59.639> of<00:04:59.789> at<00:04:59.909> the<00:04:59.969> beginning<00:05:00.330> and

00:05:00.469 --> 00:05:00.479 
read in terms of at the beginning and

00:05:00.479 --> 00:05:01.969 
read in terms of at the beginning and
knowing<00:05:00.780> what<00:05:00.990> he<00:05:01.139> would<00:05:01.289> do<00:05:01.440> on<00:05:01.560> this<00:05:01.680> kind<00:05:01.919> of

00:05:01.969 --> 00:05:01.979 
knowing what he would do on this kind of

00:05:01.979 --> 00:05:04.339 
knowing what he would do on this kind of
on<00:05:02.099> this<00:05:02.280> map<00:05:02.550> then<00:05:02.819> I<00:05:03.030> think<00:05:03.719> that<00:05:03.930> you<00:05:04.229> know

00:05:04.339 --> 00:05:04.349 
on this map then I think that you know

00:05:04.349 --> 00:05:06.110 
on this map then I think that you know
drg<00:05:05.129> should<00:05:05.340> be<00:05:05.460> able<00:05:05.550> to<00:05:05.699> know<00:05:05.819> this<00:05:05.940> as<00:05:06.090> well

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:06.120 
drg should be able to know this as well

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:07.820
