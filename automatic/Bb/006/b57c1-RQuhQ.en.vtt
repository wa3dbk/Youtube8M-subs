00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480
 still today we are going 

00:00:01.079 --> 00:00:05.910
 to make a flower in batik the roofs 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:08.730
 so you can also turned him into 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:09.809
 stern so have me if I'm going to use 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:14.160
 followers 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:18.000
 so you need towels from 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:20.070
 ribbons and linen 6 and a pair of 6 so 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.869
 you have to unfold the towel and cut 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.449
 so me you who will not last 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:26.070
 long ago I already did a way for 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.779
 I used little knowledge so 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:31.859
 it'll give you something like 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:33.079
 this when I did this you take 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:35.070
 your roses of his debt 

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:38.160
 and you take for them to be 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:48.620
 equal if you make a small accordion 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:48.620
 with Toulouse knew where your practices 

00:00:49.720 --> 00:01:01.360
 when you did this you take 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:01:03.840
 your ribbon there you media you 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:03.840
 do them 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:21.340
 as if they do not really 

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:23.590
 but that's better if you do a 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:27.990
 double or delete to avoid that 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:27.990
 flakes during the next operation 

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:40.110
 you did this cut you off the last 

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:40.110
 from your ribbon like this 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:52.539
 why was that then gives you 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:55.479
 you did that you spread like 

00:01:52.539 --> 00:02:01.140
 these and you start removing 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:02:01.140
 sheet by leaf like that 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:23.010
 it's a bit like flying 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:27.690
 so when you did it but 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:46.769
 listen side you makes the other one starts 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:51.600
 here so as if these slopes maintenance 

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:54.840
 and saas is a good baby to pu but 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:58.739
 if you refer rome a flower you 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:03:01.739
 just find the center and dismissed 

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:05.040
 a little capital it gives you anyway 

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:06.299
 something like this so with that or 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.709
 you better use it 

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:09.750
 decreasing if you make a greenhouse 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:11.910
 you can put a candle in the center 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:14.430
 and be careful in the 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:16.470
 quarters the petals and if you do 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:19.109
 a good shot you can yourself in 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:21.900
 that sense and then and then do some 

00:03:19.109 --> 00:03:23.310
 decorations it can be pretty so that's it 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:26.489
 so something I wanted you 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:28.500
 to say it were if you paid for 

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:31.650
 things to tell us if you want a 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:32.819
 special DIY idea you do not have 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:35.280
 in Lyon all the comments and 

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:37.670
 then we will make videos at the 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.670
