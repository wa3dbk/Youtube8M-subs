00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
the damage difference that game and

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.440 
the damage difference that game and
certainly<00:00:12.809> helping<00:00:13.230> on<00:00:13.530> the<00:00:13.769> kill<00:00:14.070> so<00:00:15.059> let's

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
certainly helping on the kill so let's

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:18.620 
certainly helping on the kill so let's
jump<00:00:15.750> back<00:00:15.839> into<00:00:16.170> the<00:00:16.440> arena<00:00:16.619> as<00:00:16.890> the<00:00:17.820> map<00:00:18.150> will

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
jump back into the arena as the map will

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.950 
jump back into the arena as the map will
be<00:00:19.100> nagrand<00:00:20.100> once<00:00:20.609> again<00:00:21.029> so<00:00:21.420> we<00:00:21.570> can't<00:00:21.779> get

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
be nagrand once again so we can't get

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.480 
be nagrand once again so we can't get
away<00:00:22.050> from<00:00:22.199> it<00:00:22.529> but<00:00:22.710> that's<00:00:22.890> not<00:00:23.130> always<00:00:23.340> a

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
away from it but that's not always a

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.700 
away from it but that's not always a
problem<00:00:23.910> the<00:00:24.029> players<00:00:24.269> do<00:00:24.570> like<00:00:24.810> it<00:00:25.050> it's<00:00:25.470> a

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
problem the players do like it it's a

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.950 
problem the players do like it it's a
very<00:00:26.130> open<00:00:26.369> map<00:00:26.820> with<00:00:27.090> four<00:00:27.300> pillars<00:00:27.689> so<00:00:27.840> it

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
very open map with four pillars so it

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.230 
very open map with four pillars so it
kind<00:00:28.140> of<00:00:28.199> serves<00:00:28.500> all<00:00:28.830> Wow<00:00:29.279> purposes<00:00:30.090> and

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
kind of serves all Wow purposes and

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.630 
kind of serves all Wow purposes and
tactics<00:00:30.720> and<00:00:31.279> personally<00:00:32.279> I<00:00:32.340> think<00:00:32.369> it's

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
tactics and personally I think it's

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.639 
tactics and personally I think it's
better<00:00:32.820> than<00:00:33.120> all<00:00:33.540> the<00:00:33.690> other<00:00:33.809> arenas<00:00:34.290> so<00:00:34.500> we

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
better than all the other arenas so we

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:36.860 
better than all the other arenas so we
are<00:00:34.739> going<00:00:34.860> to<00:00:34.950> go<00:00:35.040> in<00:00:35.219> then<00:00:35.399> to<00:00:36.000> the<00:00:36.600> fourth

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
are going to go in then to the fourth

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.850 
are going to go in then to the fourth

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:52.400 
main reason I all happened and went so
wrong<00:02:50.160> was<00:02:50.549> because<00:02:50.819> zom<00:02:51.090> stayed<00:02:51.810> defensive

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410
