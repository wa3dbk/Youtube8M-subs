00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:08.099
 despite the fact that for a long time not 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:10.050
 made jipped tablets turned out 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:11.580
 very successful do the company invested in 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:13.500
 him all his experience in the market 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.809
 android smartphones but truth be told 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:18.060
 our hero is quite ambiguous so we 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:20.100
 decided to collect all the operating experience and 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.260
 divide it into all pros and cons 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.090
 With you Dmitry Lutsenko and the project framework 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.980
 Today I will name 5 reasons for which 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.019
 worth buying lg g pad 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.820
 when we buy a tablet for games 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:31.610
 working with documents and surfing the Internet 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.079
 the first thing that interests us 

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:36.000
 performance where if new game 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:38.129
 suddenly begins to slow down work with 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.559
 many files in the office are accompanied by 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:42.860
 glitches about any pleasure or even 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:45.420
 comfort of speech will not be in this regard 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:47.640
 budget it can be called the keeper 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.620
 the integrity of your nervous system so 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.449
 how for a long time I use 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.890
 never been disappointed low 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:55.010
 performance of any 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.910
 high performance application 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:59.640
 provides quad-core processor 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.920
 qualcomm snapdragon 600 running on 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.650
 frequency 1 and 7 gigahertz video 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:07.680
 handles adreno 320 operational 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:09.450
 memory 2 gigabytes of storage 16 but none 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.640
 won't ban expand it by 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:14.010
 install micro sd memory card 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.530
 throws the tablet battery capacity 4 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:18.630
 1600 milliampere hours which is enough 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.150
 for a few days more or less active 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.190
 use or otherwise 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:24.470
 If you use the tablet only at home after 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:26.450
 many will surely say that 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:29.420
 performance is not the highest that 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:31.100
 there are over dragon 800 and adreno 330 but how 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:33.560
 the man who used the tablet 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:35.360
 month i can say i'm technical 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:37.550
 characteristics I remembered only in 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:39.440
 script writing time second reason 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:41.270
 pay attention to the lg g pad 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:43.610
 it's the brightest and most colorful of it 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:45.170
 component display to games and 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:47.360
 the device is really difficult 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:50.900
 find fault for genes 8 and 3 inches 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:54.140
 the resolution of 1920 by 1200 points density 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:56.360
 272 pixels now what for tablets 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:58.160
 more than enough color rendering 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:00.050
 close to natural with a little 

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:02.180
 slope saturated tones which is quite 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:04.280
 typical of the device from fuji 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:06.260
 viewing angles are almost maximized and 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:08.510
 the only thing that let me down a little 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:10.459
 brightness range in the dark work with 

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:13.880
 The screen is not very comfortable but getting used to 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:15.650
 can cause number 3 case with one 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:18.290
 hand he is prettier thanks to the absence 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:20.360
 cheap gloss and charismatic presence 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:22.459
 ground metal with another tablet 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:24.140
 practical because it is calm in the cold 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:25.700
 you can hold the plastic ends 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:27.790
 which also makes the design 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:30.350
 more elastic which reduces the likelihood 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:32.120
 critical damage during falls 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:34.130
 also worth noting the small width 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:36.950
 thanks to which the tablet can be covered 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:38.630
 palm and carry in your pocket outerwear 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:40.459
 elji always tried to do their 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:42.560
 technique is useful that's why they 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:44.600
 stuff all their gadgets with lots of 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:46.760
 chips that certainly find their 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:48.980
 real life application fourth 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:51.410
 the reason is the functional let's talk about 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:53.570
 it optimus it is installed on top with 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:55.420
 android replete with an abundance of functional 

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:57.410
 elements among them can be noted 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:59.180
 a slide cue gadget which 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:01.400
 especially convenient on devices with 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:03.560
 large displays in addition to standard 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:06.110
 tools for organizing multitasking 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:07.910
 feature is a slide and site it 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:09.739
 clearly useful during work with 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:11.750
 documents for managing appliances 

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:13.730
 click.ru service available hammer it 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:15.470
 Widget can be added as on loxgrin 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:17.630
 so in the notification bar by the way 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:19.760
 the latter contains a lot of all kinds 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:21.380
 shortcuts and switches lovers 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:23.930
 quick access to basic settings 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:25.459
 clearly appreciate this approach in truth 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:27.440
 speaking talk about software 

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:28.640
 stuffing forehead can be very up to 

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:30.290
 it is unlikely anyone will survive 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:32.420
 the twenty minute reason therefore 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:34.370
 we confine ourselves to the above more 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:36.290
 details you can find out from our 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:38.420
 reviews links to texts can be seen in 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:40.700
 Description Well, the last fifth reason 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:42.290
 price in Ukraine jeep cost less than three 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:44.570
 thousand hryvnia that as for me is very 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:46.490
 nice price tag and for tablets great 

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:48.860
 the number of advantages that was 

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:49.990
 Ferrum edited this material 

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:52.310
