00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:06.010
 you 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:14.809
 hello how about youtube friends like in 

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:14.809
 a previous video had mentioned them 

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:20.840
 and I owe you the video this 

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:22.890
 let's do the installation of this 

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:25.470
 found what is 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:28.080
 the cover of the make love brand 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.090
 galaxy s 5 now yes we have the 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:33.450
 device 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:35.940
 the phone and we are going to perform what is 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:38.340
 the installation of the cover for it 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.340
 Well first let's take the part 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:43.460
 the back part 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:45.310
 let's place this one 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:49.410
 rubber 

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:49.410
 in this part we are going to accommodate the 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.470
 comes with a view 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:04.489
 and we will also place 

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:07.549
 the protector of the audis of the connector 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:10.430
 of hearing aids there is 

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:13.720
 after this we will need 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:18.790
 put the device here 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:21.700
 there it is and a small one comes a little 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:23.320
 I wipe a microfiber to clean the 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:25.730
 screen 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:28.040
 and place 

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:32.830
 on top 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:32.830
 that would cover the device 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:37.360
 the best you can 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:50.660
 you have to clean 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:55.300
 what is this part to prevent that 

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:55.300
 finger spots remain there 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:07.469
 if you have not seen the unboxing of this 

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:10.530
 found you can see here I leave a link 

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:12.780
 straight to the video or I can do the same 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:16.590
 leave in the description of the video if 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:19.940
 for if you want to see the unboxing there 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:19.940
 you can check it 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:26.000
 what is included in this case 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:28.570
 and well, although here I would say nothing more 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.570
 this over 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.520
 A) Yes 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:34.640
 and so 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:45.580
 and then nothing more from the back 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:48.510
 the screws would go ok 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:48.510
 I'm going to screws 

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:55.920
 and once exposed the top 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:55.920
 we flipped 

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:01.340
 to be able to screw 

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:46.220
 well already once screwed well more or 

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:46.220
 unless we proceed 

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:55.880
 force 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:55.880
 in such a way that it is well sealed 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:24.560
 once this is done and there is the case 

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:28.440
 and then we'll turn it is 

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:32.190
 pressing here in this part this side 

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:34.280
 we have the volume buttons 

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:37.220
 up volume down 

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:41.000
 on the bottom we have what 

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:43.760
 would be the usb port the really good one 

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:46.570
 of things that do exist complicated from 

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:46.570
 be here he 

00:04:46.639 --> 00:04:53.860
 a microusb port there is 

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:56.200
 a little complicated 

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:58.900
 but from then on, though 

00:04:56.200 --> 00:05:01.230
 pretty good 9 that if you resist the 

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:01.230
 hits 

00:05:02.449 --> 00:05:08.139
 in the robust it looks quite robust the 

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:10.810
 sheath 

00:05:08.139 --> 00:05:13.590
 in the top part we have 

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:13.590
 this is the 

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:18.959
 the 

00:05:16.409 --> 00:05:21.929
 the coverage for the connector 

00:05:18.959 --> 00:05:24.590
 hearing aids is here would be the little hole 

00:05:21.929 --> 00:05:26.980
 for the infrared 

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:29.560
 is the camera 

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:33.940
 sensor 

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:36.250
 the heart rate the led flash and in this 

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:37.950
 part we have the hole for 

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:42.740
 horns 

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:42.740
 and then the button is free 

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:46.180
 d 

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:51.950
 so everything working properly 

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:57.620
 no there is no problem 

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:59.650
 so good optionally brings this 

00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:03.000
 belt that 

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:03.000
 I do not know how to say it 

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:07.280
 the new one is already quite big as 

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:09.440
 to enter the stock market and then add the 

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:12.320
 belt is therefore 

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:15.270
 I remove complicated but yes that is matter 

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:17.760
 of tastes and good 

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:20.610
 as for the foundation, yes, the truth 

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:24.260
 I like it a lot because it allows us 

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:30.140
 hold the phone with greater security 

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:30.140
 and then you see that if you add it enough 

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:35.660
 it looks like it adds a lot of protection 

00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:40.260
 of being therefore by the gums as 

00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:42.330
 by the metal parts and well 

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:44.880
 I think this has been all for the day of 

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:46.260
 In this video today I say goodbye I am 

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:48.360
