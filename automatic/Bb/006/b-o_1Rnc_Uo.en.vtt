00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.820
 hello friends of hello culiacán the day of 

00:00:02.390 --> 00:00:06.740
 today we are going to talk about the threads not of 

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:08.540
 the leggings and also also a new 

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:11.510
 trend in gentlemen that is 

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:12.650
 called making still heard of this 

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:14.090
 Well, just today 

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:15.769
 let's talk with the expert of 

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:18.199
 encourage the truth that the laws are very 

00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:20.029
 comfortable I do not think the first so 

00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:23.480
 as the first benefit is that they are very 

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:26.180
 comfortable but good almost all of us can 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:27.619
 using the problem is how we use it but 

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:29.570
 a little bit of what can be done 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:31.430
 with the leggins was not if you're a 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:34.850
 little bit above the weight I opted for a 

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:37.339
 black leggings smooth and dark not dark and 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:40.940
 thick because it also sometimes happens that 

00:00:37.339 --> 00:00:43.339
 I buy one I do not know very cheap and everything and that 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:45.049
 sometimes it is noticeable everything is not 

00:00:43.339 --> 00:00:46.549
 Transparent transparent made in 

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:48.379
 a picture that is rolling by the 

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:50.089
 facebook where we see the brand of a 

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:51.469
 very famous kitten because it's transparent 

00:00:50.089 --> 00:00:53.420
 is even asking for help then no 

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:55.670
 you have to do that please do not put 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:58.100
 the leggings, they already started to do 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:00.379
 gym and we've already taken them out of the gym for 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:02.749
 streets but even if we have to 

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:05.299
 adapt we can not use with tops 

00:01:02.749 --> 00:01:06.230
 propet with the cortitos if we have to 

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:08.450
 use 

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:10.970
 more the same very thin sales 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:12.890
 because there at the end you see everything not like 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:15.470
 than the thinnest girls by a link 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:17.870
 with short brujita but you could tell all 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:19.730
 the bottom part and the best one looks 

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:22.970
 this is an example that almost everyone 

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:25.760
 we can use because it's a black black and 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:29.330
 because it is thick they are not transparent with 

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:31.490
 a printed blouse plus the twine 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:35.090
 I can not loose a long blouse either 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:37.820
 but attached unless I can opt 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:41.150
 maybe for a choice of one more blouse 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:43.280
 short but I put a jacket or a 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:45.770
 something denim shirt above me 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:47.840
 cover the pompeii now by leaving us a 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:49.670
 little for the gentlemen this new 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:50.840
 fashion that is now rolling also by 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:52.970
 social networks and supposedly 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:54.470
 will be super inem this season of 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:56.540
 spring let's see if it's true here 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:58.700
 in culiacán that are the famous me jeans 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:00.920
 which is the same, but now for 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:03.770
 the men what do you think about this look at 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:05.750
 I particularly do not like it but I 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:08.210
 I think you have to be very man very 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:09.980
 male to use it also then the 

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:11.180
 true that yes you can not because as 

00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:13.579
 We are talking 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:15.799
 Peter May and William Shakespeare used 

00:02:13.579 --> 00:02:18.530
 law and then because today's men 

00:02:15.799 --> 00:02:20.689
 you can not use them if you can but as 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:23.900
 It's worth the same thing that women do not have to 

00:02:20.689 --> 00:02:25.790
 consider balancing I can not put today 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:27.920
 men have more volumes of 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:29.989
 down there and all then not all but 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:32.120
 Either way you will notice not very 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:34.400
 Well now you can not go wrong and 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:36.290
 we have a little surprise danny I found 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:38.989
 a size here that will look great 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:41.450
 the lad well I'll send for 

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:44.090
 gift but I want to see it sometimes 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:46.159
 you have what the client asks for true 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:49.629
