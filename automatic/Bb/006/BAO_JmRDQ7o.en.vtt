00:00:01.129 --> 00:00:05.220
 We have ways and means you can 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:07.379
 to speak 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.599
 Well, while the German players always 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:11.340
 still on a release date for the house 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:13.679
 Partner city work waiting 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.570
 Let's take a look at where the 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:16.920
 differences between the pc and the 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.680
 console version are because there is yes 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.779
 some of what we know in all versions 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.039
 in germany are the swastikas 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:25.920
 shortened and anti-constitutional 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:28.439
 symbols but this is only in the pc 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.599
 to see exactly why 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:31.619
 complete scene we see here so 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.540
 is synonymous with pc version 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.730
 The is marked in the 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.219
 console version absolutely cut out 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.910
 and nothing at all to see as a 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:43.500
 Jammer because there miss the consumer 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:47.539
 like some residents of south park here 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.539
 From the aliens a rectal exam 

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:56.190
 Of course it was full and yes, it was like 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.140
 said in the ps3 version of this funny 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:01.170
 do not play minigames and in the xbox 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:03.750
 360 version as well otherwise 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:07.409
 the version resemble each other like a 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:09.240
 others only in the console version 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:11.490
 will this city mini games it has 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:14.040
 To see a panel that you get in 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:18.960
 Explains what would have happened if you did 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:21.240
 had seen and now yes so you can see 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.250
 who has the young lord had here 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.080
 through this treatment there is a small 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.759
 teleporter for behind internet 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:34.799
 used so get even 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:36.299
 Yes, yes, yes, and that is now 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:38.490
 almost the same scene only in the 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:42.420
 console socket so ps3 and xbox 360 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:45.930
 and there it is europeans get here 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:47.340
 just to see a board where then 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.780
 explains what happens in the scene 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.729
 who said and we know now 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:54.360
 finally what is the plural of amos 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:57.180
 Everything learned again, so to speak 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:59.820
 fulfill the educational mission so and 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.760
 hereafter this text insert sets 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.200
 then the 

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:05.230
 So we had one again with this 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:07.150
 scene and immediately right back 

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:09.760
 text board bad news europe 

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:11.170
 as well as that this mini game was that 

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:12.700
 previously seen in the pc version 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:16.060
 that too is missing in the console version 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:18.520
 children and then it almost disappears 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:21.160
 a back to the game with this moment 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:25.840
 where then you get this teleporter 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:28.090
 and if it is then as usual 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:31.830
 continue and you can be happy with 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:31.830
 teleport the bus through the area 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:36.490
 you did not even know that you were like that 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:38.050
 I really wanted to have that 

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:40.810
 I had a playground at that time 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:42.820
 also gladly in real now no 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:44.670
 and now we see those again 

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:48.940
 pc-version 1 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:51.000
 yes, also quite a bad minigame, too 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:54.490
 this is not in the console version 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:56.380
 playable to say I play yes 

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:58.090
 intentionally bad this scene ago 

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:00.160
 So you carried the wrong keys with it 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:03.490
 Something looks so offensive 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:07.480
 it 's tuned and so if you have the 

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:11.020
 pushes buttons wrong then the the 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:14.200
 Dildo in the back is active and that is his 

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:16.840
 Not to be touched by that too 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:18.790
 picture in the background by the way that's right 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:20.709
 actually nothing but they are good 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:23.850
 it's just south park assist hausberg 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:26.140
 is a bitter satire tasteless 

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:28.000
 currently up to the to 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:30.150
 pain limit and often further afield 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.959
 that upbeat is based on 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:35.010
 cross-border and well then must 

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:39.040
 you just sometimes with something live but 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:40.450
 Well, now you have to but hold yourself 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:42.880
 just to make it clear pc contains 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:44.680
 this because of xbox 360 and ps3 version 

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:47.070
 not see now the same again 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:47.070
 Why 

00:03:48.689 --> 00:03:53.349
 there we are console version since that 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:57.129
 same game 

00:03:53.349 --> 00:04:00.670
 This scene is not included 

00:03:57.129 --> 00:04:03.129
 So this description text certainly 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:05.019
 humorous solved but I guess I 

00:04:03.129 --> 00:04:06.700
 speak for just about every player you can 

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:08.400
 would have liked to gamble city 

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:11.590
 just to read 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:13.659
 yes, I also have some of one 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:18.280
 comment I have seen you the 

00:04:13.659 --> 00:04:21.220
 is nothing without anal probe so that 's it 

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:22.690
 the censorship is about the principle yes people 

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:24.430
 simply rejects the principle that will 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:27.070
 not that's right so now what 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:28.810
 Another fact later each game 

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:34.270
 in the abortion clinic here we see 

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:36.280
 again, the pc version now exactly this 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:38.860
 scene where it just blinded 

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:40.090
 is missing in the console version so that 

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:41.800
 here what we see here now is one 

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:45.099
 console socket not in the pc 

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:46.720
 contains an abortion 

00:04:45.099 --> 00:04:48.190
 mini-games or the doctor 

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:50.650
 is trying to abort us 

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:52.360
 By the way, we are a guy 

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:53.560
 yes so it can not be ok 

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:55.780
 and here we feel it ourselves 

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:57.909
 abortion by again a guy 

00:04:55.780 --> 00:05:00.340
 yes or that is pretty much right 

00:04:57.909 --> 00:05:04.060
 badly wrong so these see in the 

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:05.440
 console capture and playful 

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:07.570
 probably not a big loss though 

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:12.900
 for south park fans and yes in principle 

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:12.900
 cut denier yes no great thing 

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.639
