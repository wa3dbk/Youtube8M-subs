00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:03.939
 or not 

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:19.200
 the shoe is the feeling of working 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:23.189
 with noble materials to start looking for 

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:25.320
 leather and touch and look for the 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:27.150
 hides have different types of life at 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.279
 body has been stamped to the body are with 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:32.099
 shines a thousand days from there leaves as the 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:34.739
 Super nice feeling of playing 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.660
 touch and the whole process of shoes like 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:39.150
 good manual comfort heal how are you going 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.750
 feeling every step I was making 

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:41.750
 the shoe 

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:48.230
 with the theme of the shoe watching a strain 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:50.810
 of a magazine that left an address 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:52.640
 of ekin and I started from shoes for that 

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:54.890
 I will buy them for me when I arrive 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:56.510
 this shoe factory told me that 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:57.980
 I wanted it to be for everyone the secretary 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:59.420
 they said that I had to hope that I did not 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:01.940
 they felt one by one differences 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:04.190
 quantities and that's when the door opened 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:05.020
 owner of the shoe factory and I what 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:07.730
 saw 

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:10.090
 girlfriend surrendered to her feet in the same 

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:10.090
 moment 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:17.210
 he followed up with the subject to his factory and so 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:19.700
 hit of mistratÃ³ of very punctual form 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:22.270
 from there install a tiny factory 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:26.240
 always with the support of him and we were 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:32.590
 the theme of shoes together almost 12 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:32.590
 good years we got married we had two children 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:38.490
 the shoes today is the people who 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:42.659
 use expressing something through the shoe 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:44.189
 as clearly the women who use my 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:46.320
 shoe the example that I have super clear 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:47.939
 the profile of women who are women 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.530
 that are like much more alternative than 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:51.840
 they want to differentiate if you go with a 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:54.740
 aesthetic proposal that wants to get out what 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.740
 that delivers the dough 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:02:00.450
 and have some plane because the java 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:03.330
 shares a plane that is a drawing and 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:06.620
 take it to a relief and a feeling of 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:06.620
 creation about nice 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:12.140
 and in the year 2000 in the year 99 minutes to 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:15.080
 the crisis of the shoe was terrible I'm going to 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:17.800
 start imports and regrettable 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:17.800
 between wines 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:28.350
 and I lost all my medical factory have 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:31.620
 said that zero and as I said new 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:33.840
 shoes I never hate it anymore I 'm loaded in 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:35.280
 the bottom felt like that following the 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:37.950
 shoes and has lost the love of my life 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:40.640
 and I went with the roads between media 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:44.280
 Persistent estuaries edges sheet 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:46.860
 work in the rubber factory and in a 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:48.570
 moment felt that I hated about 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:49.950
 theme that I loved shoes not 

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:53.190
 start to miss 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:55.680
 and there after turning around a couple of 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:57.810
 months a person told me but who 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:00.090
 we knew how to ask a question to his 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:03.090
 key time and we choose let's do 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:05.040
 shoes with cones then long ago and 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:09.200
 thank god he told me super good he gave me 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:12.300
 well for a titanic job because 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:14.160
 It has to be a lot of effort 

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:15.780
 but I loved reinventing myself because I did not 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:17.490
 I'm meeting with my old audience 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:20.390
 and that I also wanted a lot of remembrance of 

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:20.390
 the mark that the table 

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:27.230
 it's like I at least believe as a 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:33.040
 son and I recognize him miles away and he 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:33.040
 mine and I know how to recognize him as a son
