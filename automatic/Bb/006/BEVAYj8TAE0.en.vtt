00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.720
 Hello everyone, welcome to the "Weather Cold Knowledge" in this episode. 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.400
 This year's rainy season has begun 

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:15.120
 Observatory at the end of March 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.840
 a yellow, red, or even black rainstorm warning signal 

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:22.880
 That is, what everyone usually calls yellow, red, and black rain. 

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:25.280
 Speaking of the rainstorm warning signal 

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:30.000
 The Observatory has started using different colors as early as 1992. 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.640
 Rainstorm warning signal system 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.120
 The earliest rainstorm warning signal 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:39.560
 Divided into four levels of green, yellow, red and black 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:44.920
 The green rainstorm warning signal was cancelled in 1998. 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:49.800
 Changed to three levels of yellow, red and black 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:55.840
 According to statistics from 1998 to March 2014 

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:59.520
 An average of 20 yellow rains per year 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:01.560
 Red rain has 4 times 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:05.120
 Black rain is less, only once a year 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.240
 The month that issued the most rainstorm warning signal is June 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.480
 And it has not been issued in December to February in winter. 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.800
 There will be a rainstorm in the beginning of March. 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:23.960
 The earliest yellow rain appeared in the year is March 5, 2009. 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:28.120
 And that day was just the thrill of 2009. 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:32.640
 Heavy rain on March 30, 2014 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.280
 I believe everyone still remembers 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:40.320
 It also broke the record of the first red rain and black rain in a year. 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:46.120
 The latest yellow, red and black rain in a year 

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:50.440
 Issued in November, October and September respectively 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:55.440
 Have you noticed that the black rainstorm warning signal is a lot? 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:59.360
 Are they in effect in the middle of the night or in the morning? 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:01.520
 Check past records 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:06.640
 Most of them appear between 2 am and 10 pm 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:11.160
 Which may be because of the summer morning 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.960
 Usually in the South China Sea, there will be some warm and humid air blowing to the coastal areas. 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:21.280
 When the warm and humid airflow encounters a cooler air mass on the shore 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:25.200
 It is easy to produce strong thunderstorms or heavy rains. 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:28.600
 According to the statistics of the Observatory 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:31.760
 Heavy rain in Hong Kong is generally a trough of low pressure 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.400
 Weather caused by tropical cyclones, southwest monsoons, cold fronts, etc. 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:42.640
 In a rainstorm case with red and black rainstorm warning signals 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:47.200
 About 60% are caused by low pressure troughs 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:48.800
 The highest proportion 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:51.480
 Followed by tropical cyclones 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:55.680
 As the director of the Observatory said in March 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:00.800
 As climate change is expected in the decades to come in the twenty-first century 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:05.000
 The number of extremely rainy years in Hong Kong will increase 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:09.320
 But there will also be a situation where there is a drought. 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:13.640
 If you want to know more about the latest information on climate change. 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:16.200
 Can browse to our website 

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:20.920
 As for how the forecasters at the Observatory predict the occurrence of heavy rain 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:23.160
 And how to issue related warnings? 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:27.480
 We will invite experts from this field to introduce to you. 

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:30.400
 This episode "Weather Cold Knowledge" ends here 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:31.440
 Thank you for watching.
