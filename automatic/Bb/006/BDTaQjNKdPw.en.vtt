FTP and going to your plugins folder you
cannot<00:00:59.340> have<00:00:59.699> a<00:00:59.730> massive<00:01:00.629> core<00:01:00.899> folder<00:01:01.609> if<00:01:02.609> you

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
cannot have a massive core folder if you

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.820 
cannot have a massive core folder if you
do<00:01:03.180> it<00:01:03.539> will<00:01:03.719> mess<00:01:03.960> up<00:01:04.170> everything

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
do it will mess up everything

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.700 
do it will mess up everything
it<00:01:05.010> really<00:01:05.519> will<00:01:06.200> how<00:01:07.200> you<00:01:07.260> would<00:01:07.530> get<00:01:07.650> a

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
it really will how you would get a

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.740 
it really will how you would get a
massive<00:01:08.189> core<00:01:08.430> folder<00:01:08.729> before<00:01:09.060> you<00:01:09.390> would<00:01:09.540> get

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
massive core folder before you would get

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.570 
massive core folder before you would get
the<00:01:09.900> factions<00:01:10.470> massive<00:01:10.860> core<00:01:11.070> folder<00:01:11.310> which

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
the factions massive core folder which

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.030 
the factions massive core folder which
is<00:01:11.729> called<00:01:12.000> M<00:01:12.299> store<00:01:12.689> which<00:01:13.350> is<00:01:13.500> in<00:01:13.619> your<00:01:13.710> main

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
is called M store which is in your main

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.789 
is called M store which is in your main
directory<00:01:14.670> and<00:01:15.409> generally<00:01:16.409> you<00:01:16.650> would

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
directory and generally you would

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.760 
directory and generally you would
install<00:01:17.330> massive<00:01:18.330> core<00:01:18.600> or<00:01:18.780> M<00:01:19.049> core<00:01:19.350> first

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
install massive core or M core first

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.980 
install massive core or M core first
without<00:01:20.310> installing<00:01:20.909> factions<00:01:21.570> will<00:01:21.750> start

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
without installing factions will start

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.780 
without installing factions will start
your<00:01:22.110> server<00:01:22.380> it<00:01:22.979> will<00:01:23.130> create<00:01:23.340> a<00:01:23.430> massive

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
your server it will create a massive

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.450 
your server it will create a massive
core<00:01:24.240> folder<00:01:24.600> if<00:01:24.960> there<00:01:25.590> is<00:01:25.710> one<00:01:25.890> created<00:01:26.340> you

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
core folder if there is one created you

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.399 
core folder if there is one created you
want<00:01:26.640> to<00:01:26.790> remove<00:01:27.180> that<00:01:27.509> and<00:01:27.750> you<00:01:27.869> want<00:01:28.229> might

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
want to remove that and you want might

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.319 
want to remove that and you want might
as<00:01:28.530> well<00:01:28.650> remove<00:01:28.890> M<00:01:29.460> core<00:01:29.729> two<00:01:29.909> because<00:01:30.210> you

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
as well remove M core two because you

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:31.850 
as well remove M core two because you
most<00:01:30.570> likely<00:01:30.900> have<00:01:31.049> the<00:01:31.079> incorrect<00:01:31.650> version

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
most likely have the incorrect version

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.140 
most likely have the incorrect version
for<00:01:32.729> your<00:01:32.909> server<00:01:33.299> so<00:01:34.290> let's<00:01:35.040> get<00:01:35.340> started

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
for your server so let's get started

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:36.770 
for your server so let's get started
shall<00:01:36.210> we

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
shall we

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.380 
shall we
so<00:01:37.409> to<00:01:38.189> determine<00:01:38.369> what<00:01:38.880> version<00:01:39.299> you're

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
so to determine what version you're

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.510 
so to determine what version you're
going<00:01:39.750> to<00:01:39.960> need<00:01:40.290> you<00:01:40.829> need<00:01:41.040> to<00:01:41.159> know<00:01:41.310> your

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
going to need you need to know your

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.789 
going to need you need to know your
server<00:01:41.850> version<00:01:42.420> first<00:01:42.689> to<00:01:43.350> find<00:01:43.619> this

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
server version first to find this

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.100 
server version first to find this
generally<00:01:44.520> you'll<00:01:44.790> know<00:01:45.090> what<00:01:45.600> version<00:01:45.990> you

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
generally you'll know what version you

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.280 
generally you'll know what version you
have<00:01:46.320> I<00:01:46.530> have<00:01:46.710> spec<00:01:46.950> out<00:01:47.329> 1.7.10<00:01:48.329> which<00:01:49.020> means

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
have I have spec out 1.7.10 which means

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.649 
have I have spec out 1.7.10 which means
I<00:01:49.409> will<00:01:49.470> need<00:01:49.710> to<00:01:49.829> use<00:01:49.979> a<00:01:50.100> 1.7.10<00:01:51.090> version<00:01:51.479> of

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
I will need to use a 1.7.10 version of

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.740 
I will need to use a 1.7.10 version of

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:52.130 
faction /m core to your server it's

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:54.280 
faction /m core to your server it's
basically<00:04:52.610> that<00:04:52.820> simple<00:04:53.090> once<00:04:53.930> they<00:04:54.170> have

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:54.290 
basically that simple once they have

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:56.290 
basically that simple once they have
uploaded<00:04:54.590> you're<00:04:54.950> going<00:04:55.220> to<00:04:55.340> want<00:04:55.550> to<00:04:55.610> restart

uploaded you're going to want to restart

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:58.750 
uploaded you're going to want to restart
your<00:04:56.420> server<00:04:56.750> and<00:04:57.550> essentially<00:04:58.550> they're

00:04:58.750 --> 00:04:58.760 
your server and essentially they're

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:01.630 
your server and essentially they're
installed<00:04:59.240> now<00:05:00.230> a<00:05:00.590> lot<00:05:00.890> of<00:05:00.980> people<00:05:01.250> might

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:01.640 
installed now a lot of people might

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:04.180 
installed now a lot of people might
think<00:05:01.670> this<00:05:02.000> is<00:05:02.060> extremely<00:05:02.930> simple<00:05:03.200> and<00:05:03.680> it

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:04.190 
think this is extremely simple and it

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:07.860 
think this is extremely simple and it
truly<00:05:04.550> is<00:05:04.990> but<00:05:05.990> I<00:05:06.020> felt<00:05:06.470> like<00:05:06.680> a<00:05:06.920> lot<00:05:07.400> of<00:05:07.430> people

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:07.870 
truly is but I felt like a lot of people

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:10.650 
truly is but I felt like a lot of people
do<00:05:08.870> not<00:05:08.900> know<00:05:09.080> how<00:05:09.500> to<00:05:09.560> install<00:05:10.040> factions

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:10.660 
do not know how to install factions

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:13.630 
do not know how to install factions
correctly<00:05:11.660> so<00:05:12.290> I<00:05:12.350> hope<00:05:12.800> this<00:05:12.950> clears<00:05:13.250> up<00:05:13.430> any

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:13.640 
correctly so I hope this clears up any

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:15.820 
correctly so I hope this clears up any
questions<00:05:13.970> you<00:05:14.510> might<00:05:14.750> have<00:05:14.810> had<00:05:15.200> with

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:15.830 
questions you might have had with

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:19.210 
questions you might have had with
factions<00:05:16.490> /m<00:05:17.090> core<00:05:17.410> and<00:05:18.410> how<00:05:18.680> the<00:05:18.740> plugin

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:19.220 
factions /m core and how the plugin

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:21.820 
factions /m core and how the plugin
works<00:05:19.430> and<00:05:19.790> how<00:05:19.910> to<00:05:19.970> install<00:05:20.450> it<00:05:20.690> it's<00:05:21.320> fairly

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:21.830 
works and how to install it it's fairly

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:24.250 
works and how to install it it's fairly
simple<00:05:22.250> once<00:05:22.640> you<00:05:22.760> understand<00:05:23.480> the<00:05:23.660> concept

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:24.260 
simple once you understand the concept

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:26.290 
simple once you understand the concept
of<00:05:24.500> you<00:05:24.740> have<00:05:24.980> to<00:05:25.220> have<00:05:25.400> the<00:05:25.550> same<00:05:25.760> version<00:05:26.030> as

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:26.300 
of you have to have the same version as

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:28.000 
of you have to have the same version as
your<00:05:26.450> server<00:05:26.720> you<00:05:27.350> have<00:05:27.500> to<00:05:27.620> make<00:05:27.770> sure<00:05:27.920> you

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:28.010 
your server you have to make sure you

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:30.580 
your server you have to make sure you
have<00:05:28.130> M<00:05:28.310> core<00:05:28.610> and<00:05:28.820> they<00:05:29.270> have<00:05:29.540> to<00:05:29.780> be<00:05:29.960> versions

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:40.940 
work correctly that is a key thing to

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:43.390 
work correctly that is a key thing to
installing<00:05:41.390> factions<00:05:42.110> now<00:05:42.620> I<00:05:42.650> will<00:05:43.010> provide<00:05:43.220> a

00:07:06.930 --> 00:07:06.940 
come up that means that the version you

00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:11.160
