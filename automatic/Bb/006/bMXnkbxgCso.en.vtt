so today I'm going to show you how to
use<00:00:03.300> a<00:00:03.330> texture<00:00:03.959> to<00:00:03.990> enhance<00:00:04.710> your<00:00:04.950> image<00:00:05.460> we

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:06.420 
use a texture to enhance your image we

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:08.629 
use a texture to enhance your image we
recently<00:00:06.690> released<00:00:07.200> a<00:00:07.620> doublet<00:00:07.980> called<00:00:08.220> worn

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:08.639 
recently released a doublet called worn

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:10.870 
recently released a doublet called worn
there's<00:00:09.450> sixteen<00:00:09.840> by<00:00:09.960> twenty<00:00:09.990> textures<00:00:10.800> that

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:10.880 
there's sixteen by twenty textures that

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:13.970 
there's sixteen by twenty textures that
we've<00:00:11.880> created<00:00:12.210> in<00:00:12.719> order<00:00:12.840> to<00:00:13.019> enhance<00:00:13.830> your

we've created in order to enhance your

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:15.560 
we've created in order to enhance your
photographs<00:00:14.460> so<00:00:15.059> I'm<00:00:15.120> going<00:00:15.269> to<00:00:15.299> start<00:00:15.509> here

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
photographs so I'm going to start here

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.230 
photographs so I'm going to start here
with<00:00:15.960> a<00:00:15.990> newborn<00:00:16.560> baby<00:00:16.800> and<00:00:17.310> I'm<00:00:17.880> going<00:00:18.090> to

with a newborn baby and I'm going to

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.150 
with a newborn baby and I'm going to
basically<00:00:18.930> I've<00:00:19.289> already<00:00:19.560> opened<00:00:19.650> my<00:00:19.920> file

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
basically I've already opened my file

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.010 
basically I've already opened my file
I'm<00:00:20.640> going<00:00:20.760> to<00:00:20.850> go<00:00:20.939> into<00:00:21.119> the<00:00:21.330> dud<00:00:21.539> tlit<00:00:21.720> worn

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
I'm going to go into the dud tlit worn

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:27.920 
I'm going to go into the dud tlit worn
open<00:00:22.920> one<00:00:23.100> of<00:00:23.220> the<00:00:23.310> textures<00:00:24.859> and<00:00:26.689> simply<00:00:27.689> it's

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
open one of the textures and simply it's

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:29.990 
open one of the textures and simply it's
this<00:00:28.289> easy<00:00:28.619> you're<00:00:29.250> actually<00:00:29.609> going<00:00:29.699> to<00:00:29.789> take

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
this easy you're actually going to take

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.939 
this easy you're actually going to take
the<00:00:30.179> texture<00:00:30.599> and<00:00:30.810> you're<00:00:31.170> going<00:00:31.349> to<00:00:31.380> drag<00:00:31.740> it

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
the texture and you're going to drag it

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.600 
the texture and you're going to drag it
on<00:00:32.070> to<00:00:32.489> your<00:00:32.640> image<00:00:34.010> now<00:00:35.010> these<00:00:35.190> are<00:00:35.370> quite

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
on to your image now these are quite

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.430 
on to your image now these are quite
large<00:00:35.940> because<00:00:36.239> I<00:00:36.450> wanted<00:00:36.719> to<00:00:36.809> make<00:00:36.989> sure<00:00:37.020> that

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
large because I wanted to make sure that

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.389 
large because I wanted to make sure that
we<00:00:37.680> they<00:00:38.010> were<00:00:38.070> large<00:00:38.520> enough<00:00:38.579> to<00:00:40.100> be<00:00:41.100> able<00:00:41.280> to

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
we they were large enough to be able to

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.459 
we they were large enough to be able to
use<00:00:41.640> on<00:00:41.879> really<00:00:42.450> large<00:00:42.600> portraits<00:00:43.200> and<00:00:43.350> so

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
use on really large portraits and so

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.500 
use on really large portraits and so
forth<00:00:43.739> so<00:00:44.460> anyway<00:00:44.700> this<00:00:44.820> is<00:00:44.879> quite<00:00:45.239> bigger

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
forth so anyway this is quite bigger

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.510 
forth so anyway this is quite bigger
than<00:00:45.840> the<00:00:46.320> image<00:00:46.649> so<00:00:46.860> I'm<00:00:46.950> actually<00:00:47.160> going<00:00:47.430> to

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
than the image so I'm actually going to

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:54.350 
than the image so I'm actually going to
size<00:00:47.730> it<00:00:47.940> down<00:00:52.129> so<00:00:53.129> you<00:00:53.250> could<00:00:53.489> just<00:00:53.520> transform

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
size it down so you could just transform

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.160 
size it down so you could just transform
it<00:00:54.570> really<00:00:55.110> easily<00:00:55.350> and<00:00:56.660> I<00:00:57.660> actually<00:00:57.780> don't

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
it really easily and I actually don't

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.020 
it really easily and I actually don't
want<00:00:58.320> any<00:00:58.680> of<00:00:58.770> that<00:00:58.829> color<00:00:59.160> to<00:00:59.370> show<00:00:59.579> so<00:00:59.910> I'm

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
want any of that color to show so I'm

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.240 
want any of that color to show so I'm
just<00:01:00.180> going<00:01:00.359> to<00:01:00.510> make<00:01:00.660> sure<00:01:00.780> that<00:01:00.960> I<00:01:01.039> keep<00:01:02.039> it

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
just going to make sure that I keep it

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.579 
just going to make sure that I keep it
out<00:01:03.030> of<00:01:03.210> there<00:01:03.359> for<00:01:03.539> this<00:01:03.629> time<00:01:03.930> it's<00:01:04.409> really

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
out of there for this time it's really

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.230 
out of there for this time it's really
nice<00:01:04.890> for<00:01:04.920> a<00:01:05.220> lot<00:01:05.430> of<00:01:05.549> outdoor<00:01:05.909> kind<00:01:06.180> of

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
nice for a lot of outdoor kind of

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:07.820 
nice for a lot of outdoor kind of
portraits<00:01:06.570> to<00:01:06.689> have<00:01:06.840> that<00:01:06.990> little<00:01:07.260> color<00:01:07.530> edge

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
portraits to have that little color edge

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.039 
portraits to have that little color edge
on<00:01:08.189> it<00:01:08.220> but<00:01:08.909> for<00:01:09.210> one<00:01:09.390> that's<00:01:09.570> in<00:01:09.659> the<00:01:09.750> studio

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
on it but for one that's in the studio

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:11.750 
on it but for one that's in the studio
like<00:01:10.200> this<00:01:10.380> I<00:01:10.500> like<00:01:10.650> it<00:01:10.799> better<00:01:10.950> if<00:01:11.189> it<00:01:11.340> if<00:01:11.610> it

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
like this I like it better if it if it

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.760 
like this I like it better if it if it
really<00:01:11.970> doesn't<00:01:12.299> have<00:01:12.420> that<00:01:12.570> little<00:01:12.720> color<00:01:13.590> at

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
really doesn't have that little color at

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.810 
really doesn't have that little color at
the<00:01:13.860> edge<00:01:14.869> so<00:01:15.869> I've<00:01:16.650> transformed<00:01:17.220> it<00:01:17.430> made<00:01:17.729> it

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
the edge so I've transformed it made it

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.280 
the edge so I've transformed it made it
the<00:01:17.909> size<00:01:18.090> that<00:01:18.240> I<00:01:18.299> want<00:01:18.360> to<00:01:18.600> see<00:01:18.720> it<00:01:18.869> now<00:01:18.900> what

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
the size that I want to see it now what

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:20.330 
the size that I want to see it now what
I'm<00:01:19.380> going<00:01:19.530> to<00:01:19.560> do<00:01:19.740> is<00:01:19.860> I'm<00:01:19.950> going<00:01:19.979> to<00:01:20.100> go<00:01:20.220> up

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
I'm going to do is I'm going to go up

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.100 
I'm going to do is I'm going to go up
here<00:01:20.580> and<00:01:20.610> and<00:01:21.000> you<00:01:21.060> can<00:01:21.299> see<00:01:21.450> here<00:01:21.689> I'm<00:01:21.869> in<00:01:21.990> the

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
here and and you can see here I'm in the

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.929 
here and and you can see here I'm in the
normal<00:01:22.470> blending<00:01:22.860> mode<00:01:23.070> so<00:01:23.670> I'm<00:01:23.729> going<00:01:23.880> to

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
normal blending mode so I'm going to

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:25.850 
normal blending mode so I'm going to
actually<00:01:24.119> change<00:01:24.390> that<00:01:24.840> to<00:01:25.080> soft<00:01:25.350> light

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
actually change that to soft light

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.800 
actually change that to soft light
once<00:01:26.280> you<00:01:26.369> see<00:01:26.580> soft<00:01:26.970> light<00:01:27.210> then<00:01:27.390> you'll<00:01:27.540> see

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
once you see soft light then you'll see

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.460 
once you see soft light then you'll see
the<00:01:27.990> texture<00:01:28.350> appear<00:01:28.740> in<00:01:28.860> the<00:01:28.950> image<00:01:30.470> so

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
the texture appear in the image so

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.550 
the texture appear in the image so
really<00:01:31.979> nice<00:01:32.130> quick<00:01:32.909> texture<00:01:33.600> gives<00:01:34.259> a<00:01:34.409> lot

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
really nice quick texture gives a lot

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.469 
really nice quick texture gives a lot
more<00:01:34.710> depth<00:01:34.979> to<00:01:35.130> the<00:01:35.250> image<00:01:35.280> now<00:01:35.970> obviously

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
more depth to the image now obviously

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.090 
more depth to the image now obviously
though<00:01:36.659> here<00:01:36.900> I've<00:01:37.020> brought<00:01:37.560> this<00:01:37.680> up<00:01:37.860> closer

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
though here I've brought this up closer

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.069 
though here I've brought this up closer
as<00:01:38.280> you<00:01:38.340> can<00:01:38.610> see<00:01:38.790> I<00:01:39.000> really<00:01:39.540> don't<00:01:39.720> want<00:01:39.960> that

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
as you can see I really don't want that

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:42.980 
as you can see I really don't want that
texture<00:01:40.740> on<00:01:40.979> the<00:01:41.250> child's<00:01:41.640> face<00:01:41.909> or<00:01:42.390> you<00:01:42.930> know

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
texture on the child's face or you know

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.590 
texture on the child's face or you know
on<00:01:43.170> the<00:01:43.350> tutu<00:01:43.799> so<00:01:44.399> I<00:01:44.729> have<00:01:44.880> there's<00:01:45.119> two<00:01:45.390> ways

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
on the tutu so I have there's two ways

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.690 
on the tutu so I have there's two ways
about<00:01:45.869> doing<00:01:46.350> this<00:01:46.500> and<00:01:47.100> one<00:01:47.280> of<00:01:47.399> those<00:01:47.490> ways

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
about doing this and one of those ways

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.120 
about doing this and one of those ways
is<00:01:48.000> to<00:01:48.030> actually<00:01:48.720> go<00:01:48.960> in<00:01:49.200> and<00:01:49.229> here<00:01:49.680> and<00:01:49.799> create

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
is to actually go in and here and create

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.210 
is to actually go in and here and create
a<00:01:50.159> layer<00:01:50.460> mask<00:01:50.820> and<00:01:51.329> then<00:01:51.930> you<00:01:52.320> know<00:01:52.439> you<00:01:53.100> know

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
a layer mask and then you know you know

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.090 
a layer mask and then you know you know
make<00:01:53.430> a<00:01:53.460> lasso<00:01:54.000> around<00:01:54.320> what<00:01:55.320> you<00:01:55.500> do<00:01:55.740> not<00:01:55.860> want

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
make a lasso around what you do not want

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.459 
make a lasso around what you do not want
the<00:01:56.219> texture<00:01:56.490> to<00:01:56.700> appear<00:01:57.060> on<00:01:57.350> you<00:01:58.350> know

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
the texture to appear on you know

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:01.490 
the texture to appear on you know
feather<00:01:58.799> it<00:01:59.130> and<00:01:59.450> then<00:02:00.450> go<00:02:00.630> ahead<00:02:00.750> and<00:02:00.930> fill<00:02:01.320> it

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
feather it and then go ahead and fill it

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.700 
feather it and then go ahead and fill it
with<00:02:01.649> black<00:02:01.920> -<00:02:02.579> actually<00:02:03.259> you<00:02:04.259> know<00:02:04.350> remove

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
with black - actually you know remove

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.770 
with black - actually you know remove
the<00:02:04.860> texture<00:02:05.219> from<00:02:05.369> that<00:02:05.549> area<00:02:05.790> but<00:02:06.570> one<00:02:06.750> of

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
the texture from that area but one of

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.540 
the texture from that area but one of
the<00:02:06.930> things<00:02:07.170> about<00:02:07.320> this<00:02:07.560> texture<00:02:08.129> which

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
the things about this texture which

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:09.919 
the things about this texture which
that's<00:02:08.729> fine<00:02:09.060> but<00:02:09.270> one<00:02:09.420> of<00:02:09.450> the<00:02:09.599> things<00:02:09.810> about

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
that's fine but one of the things about

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:12.260 
that's fine but one of the things about
this<00:02:10.259> texture<00:02:10.770> is<00:02:10.920> that<00:02:11.489> it<00:02:11.610> actually<00:02:12.030> gives

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
this texture is that it actually gives

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.940 
this texture is that it actually gives
it<00:02:12.450> a<00:02:12.510> little<00:02:12.690> bit<00:02:12.810> of<00:02:13.020> a<00:02:13.110> color<00:02:13.349> cast

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
it a little bit of a color cast

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:15.910 
it a little bit of a color cast
so<00:02:14.280> you<00:02:14.370> can<00:02:14.550> see<00:02:14.700> that<00:02:14.880> little<00:02:15.120> warming

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:15.920 
so you can see that little warming

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:20.030 
so you can see that little warming
nature<00:02:16.920> of<00:02:17.220> the<00:02:17.730> texture<00:02:18.150> itself<00:02:18.770> and<00:02:19.770> you're

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
nature of the texture itself and you're

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.280 
nature of the texture itself and you're
really<00:02:20.610> if<00:02:20.819> you<00:02:20.970> can<00:02:21.150> see<00:02:21.390> this<00:02:21.569> I'm<00:02:21.989> going<00:02:22.230> to

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
really if you can see this I'm going to

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.380 
really if you can see this I'm going to
move<00:02:22.440> them<00:02:22.680> image<00:02:23.580> up<00:02:23.760> so<00:02:23.910> you<00:02:24.030> can<00:02:24.209> basically

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
move them image up so you can basically

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:27.949 
move them image up so you can basically
see<00:02:25.020> how<00:02:25.620> that<00:02:26.099> color<00:02:26.489> shift<00:02:27.270> from<00:02:27.510> here<00:02:27.780> to

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:27.959 
see how that color shift from here to

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:31.190 
see how that color shift from here to
there<00:02:28.170> is<00:02:28.440> different<00:02:29.010> so<00:02:29.700> for<00:02:30.540> this<00:02:30.690> I<00:02:30.959> usually

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
there is different so for this I usually

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.800 
there is different so for this I usually
do<00:02:31.650> not<00:02:31.680> do<00:02:32.250> a<00:02:32.489> layer<00:02:32.760> mask<00:02:32.790> unless<00:02:33.420> I<00:02:33.600> feel

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
do not do a layer mask unless I feel

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:35.570 
do not do a layer mask unless I feel
like<00:02:33.989> that<00:02:34.200> the<00:02:34.380> color<00:02:34.620> is<00:02:34.830> making<00:02:35.190> the<00:02:35.310> skin

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
like that the color is making the skin

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:37.280 
like that the color is making the skin
tones<00:02:35.819> way<00:02:36.120> too<00:02:36.180> warm<00:02:36.540> or<00:02:36.780> something<00:02:37.110> that<00:02:37.260> I

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
tones way too warm or something that I

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.170 
tones way too warm or something that I
really<00:02:37.620> don't<00:02:37.800> want<00:02:38.010> so<00:02:38.640> I'm<00:02:38.730> actually<00:02:38.910> going

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
really don't want so I'm actually going

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:40.520 
really don't want so I'm actually going
to<00:02:39.270> go<00:02:39.420> in<00:02:39.630> now<00:02:39.810> I'm<00:02:39.959> going<00:02:40.110> to<00:02:40.200> throw<00:02:40.410> away

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
to go in now I'm going to throw away

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:42.650 
to go in now I'm going to throw away
this<00:02:40.890> mask<00:02:41.190> because<00:02:41.790> that's<00:02:42.000> not<00:02:42.180> what<00:02:42.360> I<00:02:42.390> want

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
this mask because that's not what I want

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:46.550 
this mask because that's not what I want
so<00:02:42.920> delete<00:02:43.920> it<00:02:44.099> I<00:02:44.400> don't<00:02:45.120> want<00:02:45.300> to<00:02:45.330> apply<00:02:45.599> it<00:02:45.750> so

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
so delete it I don't want to apply it so

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.170 
so delete it I don't want to apply it so
now<00:02:46.680> here<00:02:46.860> we<00:02:46.890> are<00:02:46.980> back<00:02:47.310> to<00:02:47.519> the<00:02:47.640> situation

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
now here we are back to the situation

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:51.410 
now here we are back to the situation
remember<00:02:48.930> this<00:02:49.080> is<00:02:49.290> in<00:02:49.319> normal<00:02:49.980> and<00:02:50.239> then<00:02:51.239> we

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
remember this is in normal and then we

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:53.960 
remember this is in normal and then we
normal<00:02:52.260> and<00:02:52.440> then<00:02:52.560> we've<00:02:52.709> changed<00:02:53.010> this<00:02:53.280> to

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
normal and then we've changed this to

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:55.640 
normal and then we've changed this to
soft<00:02:54.239> light<00:02:54.450> blending<00:02:54.810> mode<00:02:55.019> to<00:02:55.260> get<00:02:55.470> that

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
soft light blending mode to get that

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:57.500 
soft light blending mode to get that
textured<00:02:56.069> effect<00:02:56.190> so<00:02:57.030> what<00:02:57.209> I'm<00:02:57.330> actually

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
textured effect so what I'm actually

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:00.770 
textured effect so what I'm actually
going<00:02:57.840> to<00:02:57.900> do<00:02:58.110> this<00:02:58.440> is<00:02:58.620> how<00:02:58.650> I<00:02:59.010> do<00:02:59.069> it<00:02:59.720> so<00:03:00.720> I

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
going to do this is how I do it so I

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:03.080 
going to do this is how I do it so I
don't<00:03:00.870> again<00:03:01.440> lose<00:03:01.739> that<00:03:02.040> color<00:03:02.400> that<00:03:02.700> warmth

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
don't again lose that color that warmth

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:05.660 
don't again lose that color that warmth
that<00:03:03.150> I'm<00:03:03.420> receiving<00:03:03.810> from<00:03:04.049> that<00:03:04.560> nice<00:03:05.190> warm

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
that I'm receiving from that nice warm

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:08.960 
that I'm receiving from that nice warm
texture<00:03:06.540> there<00:03:06.750> now<00:03:07.260> if<00:03:07.380> it<00:03:07.500> was<00:03:07.620> gray<00:03:08.010> let's

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970 
texture there now if it was gray let's

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:11.509 
texture there now if it was gray let's
go<00:03:09.150> in<00:03:09.360> and<00:03:09.510> desaturate<00:03:10.319> it<00:03:10.530> so<00:03:10.860> if<00:03:10.920> we<00:03:11.040> went

00:03:11.509 --> 00:03:11.519 
go in and desaturate it so if we went

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:16.039 
go in and desaturate it so if we went
and<00:03:11.790> actually<00:03:12.830> D<00:03:13.830> saturated<00:03:14.700> the<00:03:14.850> paper<00:03:15.090> the

00:03:16.039 --> 00:03:16.049 
and actually D saturated the paper the

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:18.289 
and actually D saturated the paper the
the<00:03:16.350> texture<00:03:16.830> then<00:03:17.430> we<00:03:17.670> wouldn't<00:03:17.970> get<00:03:18.060> that

00:03:18.289 --> 00:03:18.299 
the texture then we wouldn't get that

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:19.849 
the texture then we wouldn't get that
color<00:03:18.540> passed<00:03:18.870> you<00:03:19.170> see<00:03:19.350> the<00:03:19.470> difference

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:19.859 
color passed you see the difference

00:03:19.859 --> 00:03:20.360 
color passed you see the difference
there

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:20.370 
there

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:23.780 
there
so<00:03:21.209> there's<00:03:21.480> D<00:03:21.900> saturated<00:03:22.500> so<00:03:22.859> if<00:03:23.220> then<00:03:23.549> that's

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
so there's D saturated so if then that's

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:25.520 
so there's D saturated so if then that's
going<00:03:24.000> to<00:03:24.060> actually<00:03:24.540> make<00:03:24.690> the<00:03:24.870> texture<00:03:25.200> gray

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
going to actually make the texture gray

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:27.470 
going to actually make the texture gray
let<00:03:25.950> me<00:03:26.070> show<00:03:26.250> you<00:03:26.340> the<00:03:26.519> saturation<00:03:27.209> so<00:03:27.420> you

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 
let me show you the saturation so you

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:29.330 
let me show you the saturation so you
can<00:03:27.780> see<00:03:28.049> now<00:03:28.260> in<00:03:28.410> normal<00:03:28.680> mode<00:03:28.950> what<00:03:29.190> it

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:29.340 
can see now in normal mode what it

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:33.500 
can see now in normal mode what it
looked<00:03:29.549> like<00:03:29.660> okay<00:03:30.660> so<00:03:31.530> anyway<00:03:32.239> I'm<00:03:33.239> gonna<00:03:33.359> go

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:33.510 
looked like okay so anyway I'm gonna go

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:34.819 
looked like okay so anyway I'm gonna go
back<00:03:33.690> in<00:03:33.840> the<00:03:33.930> history<00:03:34.019> because<00:03:34.470> I<00:03:34.560> want<00:03:34.739> to

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:34.829 
back in the history because I want to

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:37.400 
back in the history because I want to
keep<00:03:34.980> that<00:03:35.160> saturation<00:03:35.880> there<00:03:36.140> so<00:03:37.140> here<00:03:37.290> we

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:37.410 
keep that saturation there so here we

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:40.310 
keep that saturation there so here we
are<00:03:37.440> again<00:03:37.950> now<00:03:38.910> how<00:03:39.450> do<00:03:39.510> I<00:03:39.660> get<00:03:39.750> this<00:03:39.959> texture

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:40.320 
are again now how do I get this texture

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:42.710 
are again now how do I get this texture
off<00:03:40.560> the<00:03:40.709> child<00:03:41.070> and<00:03:41.400> still<00:03:42.060> keep<00:03:42.329> that<00:03:42.480> nice

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:42.720 
off the child and still keep that nice

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:44.750 
off the child and still keep that nice
warm<00:03:42.959> glow<00:03:43.290> what<00:03:43.980> I'm<00:03:44.100> gonna<00:03:44.220> do<00:03:44.459> is<00:03:44.609> I'm

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:44.760 
warm glow what I'm gonna do is I'm

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:46.880 
warm glow what I'm gonna do is I'm
actually<00:03:44.880> gonna<00:03:45.150> go<00:03:45.359> in<00:03:45.600> and<00:03:45.930> make<00:03:46.260> a<00:03:46.290> lasso

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:46.890 
actually gonna go in and make a lasso

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:50.509 
actually gonna go in and make a lasso
here<00:03:47.609> on<00:03:48.359> the<00:03:49.350> area<00:03:49.680> that<00:03:49.709> I<00:03:49.890> really<00:03:50.310> don't

00:03:50.509 --> 00:03:50.519 
here on the area that I really don't

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:55.610 
here on the area that I really don't
want<00:03:50.760> the<00:03:50.940> texture<00:03:51.359> to<00:03:51.540> appear<00:03:53.390> and<00:03:54.500> then<00:03:55.500> I'm

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:55.620 
want the texture to appear and then I'm

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:57.080 
want the texture to appear and then I'm
gonna<00:03:55.769> once<00:03:56.040> I<00:03:56.160> make<00:03:56.370> this<00:03:56.489> selection<00:03:56.760> it

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.090 
gonna once I make this selection it

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:58.819 
gonna once I make this selection it
doesn't<00:03:57.359> have<00:03:57.450> to<00:03:57.540> be<00:03:57.660> the<00:03:57.840> really<00:03:58.260> precise

00:03:58.819 --> 00:03:58.829 
doesn't have to be the really precise

00:03:58.829 --> 00:04:00.349 
doesn't have to be the really precise
I'm<00:03:59.400> just<00:03:59.549> going<00:03:59.670> to<00:03:59.760> go<00:03:59.850> and<00:04:00.030> I'm<00:04:00.120> going<00:04:00.150> to

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:00.359 
I'm just going to go and I'm going to

00:04:00.359 --> 00:04:04.190 
I'm just going to go and I'm going to
feather<00:04:00.569> it<00:04:00.720> and<00:04:02.209> then<00:04:03.209> what<00:04:03.630> I'm<00:04:03.720> gonna<00:04:03.840> do<00:04:04.049> is

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:04.200 
feather it and then what I'm gonna do is

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:06.470 
feather it and then what I'm gonna do is
I'm<00:04:04.319> actually<00:04:04.440> going<00:04:04.620> to<00:04:04.799> go<00:04:04.950> to<00:04:05.010> blur<00:04:05.519> so<00:04:06.390> I'm

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:06.480 
I'm actually going to go to blur so I'm

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:07.819 
I'm actually going to go to blur so I'm
going<00:04:06.600> to<00:04:06.660> go<00:04:06.720> to<00:04:06.780> Gaussian<00:04:07.380> blur<00:04:07.560> and<00:04:07.620> I'm

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:07.829 
going to go to Gaussian blur and I'm

00:04:07.829 --> 00:04:09.830 
going to go to Gaussian blur and I'm
gonna<00:04:07.920> make<00:04:08.069> a<00:04:08.100> really<00:04:08.430> heavy<00:04:08.790> blur<00:04:09.090> if<00:04:09.359> you

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:09.840 
gonna make a really heavy blur if you

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:11.780 
gonna make a really heavy blur if you
can<00:04:09.959> see<00:04:10.109> that<00:04:10.350> it<00:04:10.620> just<00:04:10.650> actually<00:04:11.010> just<00:04:11.250> blurs

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:11.790 
can see that it just actually just blurs

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:13.670 
can see that it just actually just blurs
that<00:04:12.060> texture<00:04:12.540> right<00:04:12.720> out<00:04:12.959> so<00:04:13.200> then<00:04:13.350> you<00:04:13.470> can't

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:13.680 
that texture right out so then you can't

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:19.190 
that texture right out so then you can't
see<00:04:13.950> it<00:04:14.100> so<00:04:15.620> now<00:04:16.880> you<00:04:17.880> might<00:04:18.060> ask<00:04:18.090> what<00:04:18.840> does<00:04:19.019> it

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:19.200 
see it so now you might ask what does it

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:21.469 
see it so now you might ask what does it
look<00:04:19.380> like<00:04:19.459> so<00:04:20.459> if<00:04:20.549> you<00:04:20.639> can<00:04:20.850> go<00:04:21.030> back<00:04:21.269> and

00:04:21.469 --> 00:04:21.479 
look like so if you can go back and

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:23.839 
look like so if you can go back and
we'll<00:04:21.660> turn<00:04:21.870> it<00:04:22.019> back<00:04:22.049> into<00:04:22.440> normal<00:04:22.830> mode<00:04:22.860> you

00:04:23.839 --> 00:04:23.849 
we'll turn it back into normal mode you

00:04:23.849 --> 00:04:25.279 
we'll turn it back into normal mode you
can<00:04:24.030> see<00:04:24.270> there<00:04:24.539> where<00:04:24.750> I<00:04:24.780> just<00:04:25.080> basically

00:04:25.279 --> 00:04:25.289 
can see there where I just basically

00:04:25.289 --> 00:04:27.200 
can see there where I just basically
blurred<00:04:26.010> out<00:04:26.250> all<00:04:26.400> that<00:04:26.550> texture<00:04:26.940> and<00:04:27.030> that's

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:27.210 
blurred out all that texture and that's

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:27.560 
blurred out all that texture and that's
why

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:27.570 
why

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:33.290 
why
disappeared<00:04:29.660> so<00:04:30.660> that's<00:04:30.930> how<00:04:31.970> go<00:04:32.970> back<00:04:33.150> to

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:33.300 
disappeared so that's how go back to

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:35.390 
disappeared so that's how go back to
soft<00:04:33.510> light<00:04:33.720> blending<00:04:34.020> mode<00:04:34.260> that's<00:04:35.100> how<00:04:35.310> you

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:35.400 
soft light blending mode that's how you

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:37.970 
soft light blending mode that's how you
can<00:04:35.670> actually<00:04:35.880> get<00:04:36.750> a<00:04:36.810> texture<00:04:37.230> on<00:04:37.530> your

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:37.980 
can actually get a texture on your

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:41.120 
can actually get a texture on your
subject<00:04:38.460> keep<00:04:39.450> the<00:04:39.600> color<00:04:39.840> cast<00:04:40.170> and<00:04:40.590> make

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:41.130 
subject keep the color cast and make

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:42.830 
subject keep the color cast and make
sure<00:04:41.280> that<00:04:41.490> the<00:04:41.640> texture<00:04:41.940> doesn't<00:04:42.540> appear<00:04:42.810> on

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:42.840 
sure that the texture doesn't appear on

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:44.960 
sure that the texture doesn't appear on
your<00:04:43.020> subject<00:04:43.440> get<00:04:44.250> a<00:04:44.280> section<00:04:44.580> on<00:04:44.670> your<00:04:44.760> image

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:44.970 
your subject get a section on your image

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:47.630 
your subject get a section on your image
sorry<00:04:45.480> anyway<00:04:46.110> thanks<00:04:46.770> for<00:04:46.890> watching<00:04:47.310> and
