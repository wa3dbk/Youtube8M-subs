go test out running water and stuff I
also<00:02:13.950> that<00:02:14.070> don't<00:02:14.430> have<00:02:14.640> better<00:02:15.600> or<00:02:16.050> smooth

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
also that don't have better or smooth

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:18.800 
also that don't have better or smooth
lighting<00:02:17.280> on<00:02:17.520> and<00:02:17.790> it<00:02:18.270> looks<00:02:18.420> a<00:02:18.480> lot<00:02:18.570> better

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
lighting on and it looks a lot better

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:20.150 
lighting on and it looks a lot better
than<00:02:18.840> smooth<00:02:19.110> lighting<00:02:19.380> in<00:02:19.470> my<00:02:19.560> opinion<00:02:19.890> so

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
than smooth lighting in my opinion so

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:21.890 
than smooth lighting in my opinion so
you<00:02:20.970> don't<00:02:21.150> have<00:02:21.210> if<00:02:21.390> you<00:02:21.480> don't<00:02:21.540> like<00:02:21.720> some

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
you don't have if you don't like some

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:24.080 
you don't have if you don't like some
lighting<00:02:22.170> on<00:02:22.410> I<00:02:22.830> would<00:02:23.520> recommend<00:02:23.910> using

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
lighting on I would recommend using

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:26.030 
lighting on I would recommend using
better<00:02:24.360> grass<00:02:24.600> but<00:02:24.870> if<00:02:24.960> you<00:02:25.050> do<00:02:25.230> better<00:02:25.800> guys

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
better grass but if you do better guys

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:28.160 
better grass but if you do better guys
can<00:02:26.310> look<00:02:26.400> pretty<00:02:26.520> cool<00:02:26.760> but<00:02:27.750> as<00:02:27.840> you<00:02:27.960> can<00:02:28.020> see

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
can look pretty cool but as you can see

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:29.690 
can look pretty cool but as you can see
now<00:02:28.290> if<00:02:28.410> I<00:02:28.470> destroy<00:02:28.770> this<00:02:28.890> block<00:02:29.160> the<00:02:29.490> water

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
now if I destroy this block the water

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.630 
now if I destroy this block the water
will<00:02:29.910> run<00:02:30.240> and<00:02:31.130> well<00:02:32.130> it<00:02:32.190> won't<00:02:32.280> actually<00:02:32.460> run

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
will run and well it won't actually run

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:35.180 
will run and well it won't actually run
right<00:02:32.910> here<00:02:33.090> because<00:02:33.620> it's<00:02:34.620> like<00:02:34.800> that<00:02:35.010> and

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
right here because it's like that and

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:37.640 
right here because it's like that and
now<00:02:35.310> it<00:02:35.430> should<00:02:35.580> run<00:02:36.200> there<00:02:37.200> we<00:02:37.290> go<00:02:37.440> it's

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650
