let's<00:00:43.040> new<00:00:44.040> game<00:00:54.890> looks<00:00:55.890> beautiful

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:10.400 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.730 

one<00:01:10.700> of<00:01:10.850> the<00:01:10.940> things<00:01:11.150> I<00:01:11.270> plan<00:01:11.330> on<00:01:11.690> doing<00:01:12.080> with

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:12.740 
one of the things I plan on doing with

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:14.890 
one of the things I plan on doing with
this<00:01:12.950> device<00:01:13.340> is<00:01:13.640> also<00:01:14.060> comparing<00:01:14.540> it<00:01:14.630> against

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:14.900 
this device is also comparing it against

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:18.910 
this device is also comparing it against
my<00:01:15.080> phone<00:01:16.210> which<00:01:17.210> also<00:01:17.690> can<00:01:18.229> emulate<00:01:18.530> pretty

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:18.920 
my phone which also can emulate pretty

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:22.210 
my phone which also can emulate pretty
well<00:01:19.840> so<00:01:20.840> far<00:01:20.869> I<00:01:21.380> mean<00:01:21.530> it<00:01:21.680> seems<00:01:21.950> like<00:01:22.040> it's

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:22.220 
well so far I mean it seems like it's

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:25.480 
well so far I mean it seems like it's
okay<00:01:22.580> it<00:01:23.000> seems<00:01:23.270> like<00:01:23.619> you<00:01:24.619> might<00:01:24.650> be<00:01:24.800> a<00:01:24.950> little

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:25.490 
okay it seems like you might be a little

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:29.560 
okay it seems like you might be a little
laggy<00:01:27.190> but<00:01:28.190> I<00:01:28.250> mean<00:01:28.490> like<00:01:28.790> if<00:01:29.090> you've<00:01:29.240> never

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:29.570 
laggy but I mean like if you've never

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:31.510 
laggy but I mean like if you've never
played<00:01:29.840> this<00:01:29.960> game<00:01:30.170> might<00:01:30.710> not<00:01:30.920> even<00:01:31.070> really

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:31.520 
played this game might not even really

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:36.249 
played this game might not even really
pick<00:01:31.729> up<00:01:31.880> on<00:01:32.090> it<00:01:32.240> I<00:01:34.600> mean<00:01:35.600> it's<00:01:36.020> hard<00:01:36.200> to

00:01:36.249 --> 00:01:36.259 
pick up on it I mean it's hard to

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:38.410 
pick up on it I mean it's hard to
complain<00:01:36.590> a<00:01:36.710> regulation<00:01:37.520> that's<00:01:37.700> like<00:01:37.880> this<00:01:38.090> I

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:38.420 
complain a regulation that's like this I

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:48.190 
complain a regulation that's like this I
mean<00:01:46.179> some<00:01:47.179> people<00:01:47.210> say<00:01:47.600> that<00:01:47.630> there<00:01:47.960> was<00:01:48.110> like

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:48.200 
mean some people say that there was like

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:52.450 
mean some people say that there was like
button<00:01:48.679> lag<00:01:50.110> doesn't<00:01:51.110> seem<00:01:51.380> to<00:01:51.649> be<00:01:51.830> any<00:01:52.009> not

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:52.460 
button lag doesn't seem to be any not

00:01:52.460 --> 00:02:02.320 
button lag doesn't seem to be any not
for<00:01:52.729> me<00:01:52.880> at<00:01:52.970> least<00:02:00.520> some<00:02:01.520> people<00:02:01.789> also<00:02:01.940> worried

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:02.330 
for me at least some people also worried

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:04.090 
for me at least some people also worried
about<00:02:02.450> the<00:02:02.690> analog<00:02:03.200> sticks<00:02:03.500> not<00:02:03.649> being<00:02:03.890> true

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:04.100 
about the analog sticks not being true

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:08.650 
about the analog sticks not being true
analog<00:02:04.429> sticks<00:02:05.950> I<00:02:06.950> know<00:02:07.580> there<00:02:08.149> was<00:02:08.360> a<00:02:08.390> video

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:08.660 
analog sticks I know there was a video

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:11.470 
analog sticks I know there was a video
of<00:02:08.929> Mario<00:02:09.289> walking<00:02:09.860> but<00:02:10.069> right<00:02:10.340> offhand<00:02:11.060> that

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:11.480 
of Mario walking but right offhand that

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:16.060 
of Mario walking but right offhand that
does<00:02:12.260> not<00:02:12.440> seem<00:02:12.769> to<00:02:12.799> be<00:02:12.950> the<00:02:13.190> case<00:02:14.650> so<00:02:15.650> right

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:16.070 
does not seem to be the case so right

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:18.220 
does not seem to be the case so right
now<00:02:16.280> this<00:02:16.820> is<00:02:16.880> totally<00:02:17.360> functioning<00:02:18.079> like<00:02:18.200> a

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.230 
now this is totally functioning like a

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:20.860 
now this is totally functioning like a
d-pad<00:02:18.650> I'm<00:02:19.459> using<00:02:19.700> the<00:02:19.910> d-pad<00:02:20.239> if<00:02:20.480> you<00:02:20.570> can<00:02:20.720> see

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:20.870 
d-pad I'm using the d-pad if you can see

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:23.920 
d-pad I'm using the d-pad if you can see
here<00:02:21.110> also<00:02:22.100> I'm<00:02:22.640> gonna<00:02:23.120> slightly<00:02:23.600> move<00:02:23.780> that

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:23.930 
here also I'm gonna slightly move that

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:29.440 
here also I'm gonna slightly move that
augghh<00:02:24.140> stick<00:02:24.560> and<00:02:24.910> Mario<00:02:25.910> runs<00:02:27.130> so<00:02:28.130> um<00:02:28.370> I<00:02:28.670> have

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:29.450

no idea how they got that to work I

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:33.160 
no idea how they got that to work I

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:33.170 
didn't really look into that whole

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:38.410 
didn't really look into that whole
analog<00:02:33.620> business<00:02:34.310> but<00:02:34.730> um<00:02:35.709> yeah

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:38.420 
analog business but um yeah

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:40.840 
analog business but um yeah
this<00:02:39.380> isn't<00:02:39.770> my<00:02:39.890> review<00:02:40.310> of<00:02:40.340> the<00:02:40.520> device

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:40.850 
this isn't my review of the device

this isn't my review of the device
either<00:02:41.120> I'm<00:02:41.600> just<00:02:42.020> showing<00:02:42.760> what<00:02:43.760> I<00:02:43.790> can<00:02:44.060> do

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:56.900 
one thing I really don't like are these

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:01.900 
one thing I really don't like are these
analog<00:02:57.440> sticks<00:02:57.800> they<00:02:58.310> are<00:02:58.370> like<00:03:00.730> they<00:03:01.730> feel

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:01.910 
analog sticks they are like they feel

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:04.390 
analog sticks they are like they feel
really<00:03:02.270> weird<00:03:02.540> you<00:03:02.750> know<00:03:02.800> imagine<00:03:03.800> if<00:03:04.130> you<00:03:04.250> had

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:04.400

had<00:03:09.230> it<00:03:09.260> on<00:03:09.709> top<00:03:10.160> of<00:03:10.190> a<00:03:10.459> rough<00:03:10.700> surface<00:03:11.000> like<00:03:11.840> I

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:12.020 
had it on top of a rough surface like I

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:38.120 
emulation and everything else so I mean

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:44.370 
emulation and everything else so I mean
I'm<00:03:38.450> not<00:03:38.660> gonna<00:03:38.810> complain<00:03:39.560> about<00:03:40.150> everything

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:44.380 

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:49.390

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:49.400 
so right now it feels okay Mario feels

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:52.140 
so right now it feels okay Mario feels
like<00:03:49.640> he's<00:03:49.850> running<00:03:50.180> around<00:03:50.390> kind<00:03:50.780> of<00:03:50.870> weird<00:03:51.079> I

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:52.150 
like he's running around kind of weird I

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:56.979 
like he's running around kind of weird I
think<00:03:53.150> that<00:03:53.660> maybe<00:03:53.930> because<00:03:54.670> of<00:03:55.840> the<00:03:56.840> whole

00:03:56.979 --> 00:03:56.989 
think that maybe because of the whole

00:03:56.989 --> 00:04:05.199 
think that maybe because of the whole
analog<00:03:57.500> stick<00:03:57.890> d-pad<00:03:58.489> situation<00:04:01.750> so<00:04:02.750> um<00:04:04.209> yeah

00:04:05.199 --> 00:04:05.209 
analog stick d-pad situation so um yeah

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:07.150 
analog stick d-pad situation so um yeah
these<00:04:05.780> analog<00:04:06.170> sticks<00:04:06.470> are<00:04:06.620> pretty<00:04:07.070> much

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:07.160 
these analog sticks are pretty much

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:10.360 
these analog sticks are pretty much
acting<00:04:07.579> like<00:04:07.700> be<00:04:07.910> pads<00:04:08.180> not<00:04:09.190> touch<00:04:10.190> my

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:10.370 
acting like be pads not touch my

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:13.060 
acting like be pads not touch my
colleagues<00:04:10.840> actual<00:04:11.840> analog<00:04:12.200> sticks<00:04:12.530> at<00:04:12.860> least

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:13.070 
colleagues actual analog sticks at least

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:16.080 
colleagues actual analog sticks at least
now<00:04:13.250> right<00:04:13.430> now<00:04:13.720> and<00:04:14.720> the<00:04:14.900> other<00:04:15.049> thing<00:04:15.260> is<00:04:15.350> I'm

definitely an interesting device um a

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:22.380 
definitely an interesting device um a
lot<00:05:20.200> of<00:05:20.230> possibilities<00:05:20.980> a<00:05:21.520> lot<00:05:21.970> of<00:05:22.060> potential

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:22.390 
lot of possibilities a lot of potential

know how to feel about this I really
feel<00:05:29.470> like<00:05:29.530> the<00:05:29.770> control<00:05:30.160> should<00:05:30.190> be<00:05:30.460> better

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:30.790 
feel like the control should be better

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:33.750 
feel like the control should be better
than<00:05:31.120> they<00:05:31.270> are<00:05:31.770> the<00:05:32.770> way<00:05:32.920> the<00:05:33.070> analog<00:05:33.400> sticks

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:33.760 
than they are the way the analog sticks

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:37.760 
than they are the way the analog sticks
feel<00:05:34.150> I<00:05:34.180> mean<00:05:34.830> everything<00:05:35.830> else<00:05:36.010> is<00:05:36.220> okay<00:05:36.640> um
