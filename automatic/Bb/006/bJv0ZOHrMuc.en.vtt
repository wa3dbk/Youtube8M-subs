you know I remember that couple from
last<00:00:32.239> year<00:00:32.480> because<00:00:33.020> they<00:00:33.380> were<00:00:33.440> they<00:00:33.950> were

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:34.010

they had basically met each others

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:37.930 
they had basically met each others
because<00:00:36.290> of<00:00:36.380> that<00:00:36.500> song<00:00:36.739> I've<00:00:37.550> heard<00:00:37.760> of<00:00:37.850> at

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:37.940 
because of that song I've heard of at

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:40.270 
because of that song I've heard of at
least<00:00:38.090> one<00:00:38.390> romance<00:00:38.840> that<00:00:39.470> has<00:00:39.650> developed<00:00:39.920> on

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:40.280 
least one romance that has developed on

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:42.030 
least one romance that has developed on
this<00:00:40.430> cruise<00:00:40.670> that<00:00:40.879> I'm<00:00:40.970> sure<00:00:41.210> there<00:00:41.449> are<00:00:41.480> more

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:42.040 
this cruise that I'm sure there are more

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:50.160 
this cruise that I'm sure there are more
but<00:00:43.040> you<00:00:43.129> know<00:00:43.190> if<00:00:43.340> it's<00:00:43.820> not<00:00:43.940> just<00:00:44.180> a<00:00:44.330> love

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:50.170 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:52.510 

the<00:00:51.170> performers<00:00:51.680> are<00:00:51.800> great<00:00:51.980> and<00:00:52.160> everything

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:52.520 
the performers are great and everything

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:57.610 
the performers are great and everything
but<00:00:52.730> I<00:00:53.390> think<00:00:53.450> that's<00:00:55.540> at<00:00:56.540> most<00:00:56.870> half<00:00:57.380> of<00:00:57.530> the

00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:57.620 
but I think that's at most half of the

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:00.550 
but I think that's at most half of the
reason<00:00:57.890> why<00:00:58.130> most<00:00:58.610> people<00:00:58.760> come<00:00:59.560> the

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:00.560 
reason why most people come the

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:04.329 
reason why most people come the
community<00:01:01.040> of<00:01:01.130> people<00:01:01.480> is<00:01:02.480> so<00:01:02.780> great<00:01:03.050> a<00:01:03.380> huge

00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:04.339 
community of people is so great a huge

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:06.969 
community of people is so great a huge
Jonathan<00:01:04.790> Coulton<00:01:05.000> fan<00:01:05.300> but<00:01:05.770> that's<00:01:06.770> not

00:01:06.969 --> 00:01:06.979 
Jonathan Coulton fan but that's not

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:08.650 
Jonathan Coulton fan but that's not
enough<00:01:07.250> reason<00:01:07.700> to<00:01:07.850> spend<00:01:08.060> thousands<00:01:08.540> of

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:08.660 
enough reason to spend thousands of

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:10.210 
enough reason to spend thousands of
dollars<00:01:08.720> and<00:01:09.050> cross<00:01:09.590> to<00:01:09.740> the<00:01:09.800> other<00:01:09.890> side<00:01:10.010> of

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:10.220 
dollars and cross to the other side of

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:12.460 
dollars and cross to the other side of
the<00:01:10.280> continent<00:01:10.700> but<00:01:11.240> I<00:01:11.300> knew<00:01:11.690> what<00:01:12.050> Jonathan
