here I work from the top edge working my

way down to the bottom we're finding the

way down to the bottom we're finding the
line<00:01:20.020> of<00:01:20.229> the<00:01:20.259> bowl<00:01:21.780> take<00:01:22.780> a<00:01:22.840> look<00:01:23.110> every<00:01:23.439> now

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:23.590

line of the bowl take a look every now
and<00:01:23.799> then<00:01:25.170> turn<00:01:26.170> the<00:01:26.380> lathe<00:01:26.590> back<00:01:26.950> on<00:01:27.630> see

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:28.630 
and then turn the lathe back on see

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:32.550 
and then turn the lathe back on see
where<00:01:28.869> you're<00:01:29.020> going<00:01:30.780> but<00:01:31.780> just<00:01:32.079> to<00:01:32.170> refine

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:32.560

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:40.090 

and<00:01:37.370> then<00:01:37.520> work<00:01:37.730> towards<00:01:38.470> the<00:01:39.470> lines<00:01:39.770> to

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:40.100 
and then work towards the lines to

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:45.490 
and then work towards the lines to
establish<00:01:40.880> that<00:01:41.420> you<00:01:41.630> wish<00:01:41.810> to<00:01:41.840> turn

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:48.980 
as I get near the bottom let's slow down

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:54.870 
as I get near the bottom let's slow down
somewhat<00:01:49.760> and<00:01:50.000> mark<00:01:50.540> my<00:01:50.600> way<00:01:50.810> down<00:01:51.110> to<00:01:51.410> their

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:00.890 
gradual shape of the bull and then you

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:03.250 
gradual shape of the bull and then you
decide<00:02:01.250> where<00:02:01.550> the<00:02:01.729> curve<00:02:01.970> will<00:02:02.210> go<00:02:02.390> the

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:03.260 
decide where the curve will go the

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:21.059 
decide where the curve will go the
closer<00:02:03.619> I<00:02:03.650> get<00:02:03.800> to<00:02:03.860> the<00:02:04.100> bottom
