 this is my first refuge my first 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.320
 refuge was the cave the mine that is 

00:00:18.599 --> 00:00:23.050
 marked and 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:25.900

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:29.220
 I found a village ja 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:36.990
 then the broad 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:36.990
 to 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:44.090
 well here I still need a lot because 

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:46.280
 good you have to get the material and 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:47.510
 others here are the exit to go towards 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:49.969
 light 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:53.260
 the cocoa I'm going to put the pumpkins 

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:55.120
 over because I like it that way but 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:57.070
 they have found pumpkins yet I do not 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:59.949
 I also miss here I do not know what 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:02.859
 Look, I have a very nice way 

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:05.979
 that gets animals many animals and 

00:01:02.859 --> 00:01:07.940
 creatures good here I guess I'm going to 

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:10.130
 make my kitchen 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:12.990
 and on this side I have the room 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:16.810
 enchantments here will be 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:18.970
 very little by little you want good 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:23.380
 I have to get the materials and 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:27.299
 others and is not as simple as I did as 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:32.770
 I the place for my cows and my sheep 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:37.030
 I put sheep on this side the cows and 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:39.610
 another I put sheep I'm going to rest in 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:41.679
 my room that I had and I returned the day 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:43.840
 next and there was nothing good happening 

00:01:41.679 --> 00:01:45.789
 then I started to protect everything 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:48.700
 everything everything so that nothing between second and 

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:50.770
 nothing comes out and I went to rest to my 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:52.950
 fourth and return the next day and not 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:55.330
 there's nothing good that's happening there 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:57.430
 then build this part of here 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:02:00.130
 broad is 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:02.590
 in this room to be watching and 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:07.240
 watching while I sleep what is it 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:09.250
 happens there and nothing because it turns out that they are the 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:12.040
 scorpions that get in and eat 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:16.510
 well they do not eat they kill the cows 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:18.240
 and the sheep and well then I decided 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:21.420
 close well all 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:23.130
 the best possible but they continue to die or 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:25.350
 Scorpions keep coming in 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:26.380
 as it happens then who knows so already 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:28.000
 he 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:29.680
 that for the pasta at last there is a 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.690
 bunch of cows everywhere and 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:35.590
 sheep what I do need is wool to 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:39.420
 me the wool of the sheep for 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:39.420
 in my house do the cute 

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:43.960
 it's our here I have the crops 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:47.980
 Y 

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:56.370
 plant cane I try to have everything close 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:58.440
 because if I'm a little scared area and that 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:00.690
 to go out and venture so be thick 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:02.280
 here I have the sowdÃ­os they put the 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:04.739
 cats get the birds they get 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:07.230
 all the animals and mellow ruins but 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:08.310
 that's why it protects seriously so that nobody 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:10.500
 between 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:12.010
 and well, something good, they burn 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:13.959
 islands 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:16.090
 it gets stuck with the little birds I have a 

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:19.310
 horse 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:24.170
 we put him protector 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:28.240
 says his armor and everything is very out 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:31.270
 with control 

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:33.549
 and the mine I have because also close 

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:36.640
 as I tell them then I 

00:03:33.549 --> 00:03:36.640
 get away much 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:51.670
 from where you have obtained diamond 

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:11.019
 I have washed there which is good good 

00:04:08.799 --> 00:04:12.530
 bad because I fall every time but good 

00:04:11.019 --> 00:04:14.870
 why 

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:16.970
 I need is going to be the portal of the CNE and 

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:20.670
 well to get things for my 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:23.520
 enchantments because I love to sing 

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:25.200
 well, I do not want anything that is laminated sometimes 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:28.630
 I sleep here because then I'm made of 

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:35.070
 night and that to go out there and good 

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:35.070
 in the bottom part of the top 

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:39.620
 I stayed 

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:45.039
 but 

00:04:42.409 --> 00:04:45.039
 yes 

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:54.780
 in the top part I'm starting 

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:57.450
 I hear lava and so good right now 

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:59.590
 I have to get coal because then 

00:04:57.450 --> 00:05:02.230
 I'm running out 

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:06.449
 then the coal I think to look for more 

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:09.919
 well over here with a bucket 

00:05:06.449 --> 00:05:09.919
 is giving me 

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:18.889
 I imagine it will be easier for 

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:18.889
 find the classic a saying 

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:25.320
 for her 

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:32.730
 i 

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:37.350
 good but I'm going to leave my houses to the 

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:40.230
 house to not lose them because I died 

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:42.870
 so many times and I've lost them that good 

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:45.810
 and I lose them because I do not locate where 

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:48.870
 I died and you have to go back for them and 

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:52.040
 when finally I stand and back 

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:52.040
 it turns out that he 

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:56.689
 they disappeared 

00:05:54.529 --> 00:05:58.129
 so then go always say many 

00:05:56.689 --> 00:06:02.499
 things 

00:05:58.129 --> 00:06:02.499
 the mine and it's now where I'm living 

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:09.630
 let's leave things to the house 

00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:09.630
 to get 

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:24.620
 to 

00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:27.169
 today 

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:28.790

00:06:27.169 --> 00:06:31.430
 nice is something that I really liked the 

00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:34.330
 true yes and there are also many 

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:34.330
 dangers ones 

00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:39.700
 i 

00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:47.480
 what to close because it is still in mind 

00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:50.240
 in a completely built of them 

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:53.210

00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:59.410

00:06:55.910 --> 00:06:59.410
 for the cat 

00:07:01.129 --> 00:07:08.949
