00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:06.150
 thank you for visiting this section 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.069
 of the premiere of the power of reading the 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:10.530
 most powerful instrument that the 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:12.990
 human being to exercise the mind is the 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:15.389
 reading besides educating us and granting 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.550
 We are privileged to know the points 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:20.340
 of sight of human beings of all the 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.289
 nationalities of all time 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:25.410
 reading recreates our imagination 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:27.750
 like nothing else in this world to the 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.789
 fewer things do they read is the 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.399
 educational entertainment par excellence 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:35.670
 nothing entertains as a good read 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:38.159
 nothing educates as she frees us from 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.859
 routine thoughts limiting those 

00:00:38.159 --> 00:00:43.649
 that model our static imagination 

00:00:40.859 --> 00:00:46.699
 mediocre boring and allows us to eliminate 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:49.049
 those mental borders the reading 

00:00:46.699 --> 00:00:51.059
 our mind trains a library not 

00:00:49.049 --> 00:00:52.979
 It is more than a gym just a 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:54.600
 gym where we will not develop 

00:00:52.979 --> 00:00:57.329
 our physical body where we lower it 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:00.539
 those kilos of pesos that we have left over but 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:02.519
 where our mind receives the exercise 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:05.189
 necessary to stay healthy fresh 

00:01:02.519 --> 00:01:06.260
 Healthy informed ready to face 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:09.350
 the challenges 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:11.690
 what can we justly submit 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:14.000
 life reading as I think I already expressed 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:15.710
 at some point it is a way of knowing 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.470
 listening allows our thinking 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:20.210
 tell us to speak to the author and that 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:22.190
 thanks to that dialogue we can engage 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:26.060
 It's just a very conversation 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:28.820
 intimate with the author that interlocutor of 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:30.830
 the pages that we have in front of that 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:32.600
 to develop the imagination is a lot 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:35.240
 more powerful than television believe me 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:37.760
 because television imposes on us already a 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:40.190
 image and a sound the reading does not 

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:42.680
 imposes nothing we are free to imagine 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:45.560
 all with the writer's guide ways 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:47.360
 way content nothing develops me 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:49.540
 would say the intellectual capacity that the 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:53.230
 reading the 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:55.180
 reading ennobles us opens us 

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:58.300
 horizons for people even by 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:02:01.260
 example of the elderly reading is 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:03.550
 until a therapeutic exercise 

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:05.650
 they even recommend reading to prevent 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:08.890
 degenerative diseases such as 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:10.540
 own Alzheimer's I say yes it's true 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:12.700
 that we are in a time when the 

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:15.670
 technological development step by step 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:17.890
 gigantic sometimes incredible but it's 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:20.860
 true also that in spite of that 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:24.040
 development I think the book is still 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:26.230
 being a powerful weapon when it comes to 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:27.790
 educate to read many tenths I want to 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:29.440
 Take a quick reading course because 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:31.360
 I want to save time if in fact with 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:33.340
 the vicious know how to read quickly 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:36.700
 but it's much more beneficial to be able to read 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:39.270
 with intention with enjoyment with delivery 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:43.750
 thanks to the books we became 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:45.580
 our own teachers so no 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:48.010
 technological development will be able to 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:50.170
 eliminate this benefit does not matter if 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:53.650
