00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
definitely be a possibility but not

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:54.830 
definitely be a possibility but not
going<00:00:53.730> to<00:00:53.789> happen<00:00:53.910> or<00:00:54.120> not<00:00:54.149> I'd<00:00:54.390> like<00:00:54.600> to<00:00:54.629> see

it my favorite might become steel fairy
it's<00:01:03.059> a<00:01:03.149> possibility<00:01:03.300> really<00:01:04.019> but<00:01:04.280> not<00:01:05.280> too

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
it's a possibility really but not too

sure a definite finger shouldn't
evolution<00:01:07.380> though<00:01:07.500> because<00:01:08.869> it's<00:01:09.869> got<00:01:10.080> so

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
evolution though because it's got so

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:11.840 
evolution though because it's got so
much<00:01:10.409> potential<00:01:10.740> here<00:01:10.920> we<00:01:11.159> have<00:01:11.280> a<00:01:11.310> huge<00:01:11.549> head

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
much potential here we have a huge head

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.330 
much potential here we have a huge head
over<00:01:12.270> if<00:01:12.750> we<00:01:13.200> have<00:01:13.380> a<00:01:13.409> small<00:01:13.590> head<00:01:13.860> with<00:01:14.010> a<00:01:14.040> huge

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
draw on the back of it maybe just maybe

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.620 
draw on the back of it maybe just maybe
it<00:01:17.130> was<00:01:17.250> into<00:01:17.520> two<00:01:17.700> types<00:01:17.939> you<00:01:18.240> know<00:01:18.299> depending

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
it was into two types you know depending

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.510 
it was into two types you know depending
on<00:01:18.720> the<00:01:18.810> location<00:01:19.140> or<00:01:19.350> something<00:01:19.680> if<00:01:20.189> it's<00:01:20.400> in

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
on the location or something if it's in

a dark location the Dark type of darks

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.539 
a dark location the Dark type of darks
takes<00:01:23.640> over<00:01:24.150> so<00:01:24.869> if<00:01:25.110> say<00:01:25.380> say<00:01:25.710> it<00:01:25.920> worked<00:01:26.220> been

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
takes over so if say say it worked been

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.550 
takes over so if say say it worked been
made<00:01:26.820> into<00:01:27.000> steel<00:01:27.360> fairy<00:01:27.659> the<00:01:28.140> dark<00:01:28.380> would

made into steel fairy the dark would

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.289 
made into steel fairy the dark would
take<00:01:28.710> over<00:01:28.890> and<00:01:29.250> it<00:01:29.549> might<00:01:29.670> become<00:01:29.820> you<00:01:30.150> know<00:01:30.270> a

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
take over and it might become you know a

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:33.499 
take over and it might become you know a
steel<00:01:30.689> dark<00:01:31.020> type<00:01:32.060> whereas<00:01:33.060> if<00:01:33.270> it<00:01:33.390> were<00:01:33.479> the

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
steel dark type whereas if it were the

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.390 
steel dark type whereas if it were the
light<00:01:33.780> location<00:01:34.200> like<00:01:34.290> outside<00:01:34.710> i<00:01:34.740> become<00:01:35.189> the

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
light location like outside i become the

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.130 
light location like outside i become the
fairy<00:01:35.700> type<00:01:35.909> might<00:01:36.060> take<00:01:36.240> over<00:01:36.540> and<00:01:36.720> become

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
fairy type might take over and become

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.340 
fairy type might take over and become
steel<00:01:37.619> fairy<00:01:38.150> so<00:01:39.150> more<00:01:39.390> arm<00:01:39.570> up<00:01:39.689> we<00:01:39.780> still

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
steel fairy so more arm up we still

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.859 
steel fairy so more arm up we still
trapped<00:01:40.590> normally<00:01:40.909> so<00:01:41.909> you<00:01:42.180> know<00:01:42.270> a<00:01:42.450> branching

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
trapped normally so you know a branching

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.030 
trapped normally so you know a branching
evolution<00:01:43.020> pathway<00:01:43.560> that<00:01:43.649> might<00:01:43.920> be

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
evolution pathway that might be

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.830 
evolution pathway that might be
interesting<00:01:44.549> the<00:01:44.939> Dark<00:01:45.149> type<00:01:45.360> might<00:01:45.570> have<00:01:45.720> you

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
interesting the Dark type might have you

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.780 
interesting the Dark type might have you
the<00:01:46.229> jaw<00:01:46.470> might<00:01:46.710> take<00:01:46.950> precedent<00:01:47.130> you<00:01:47.670> know

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
the jaw might take precedent you know

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.940 
the jaw might take precedent you know
the<00:01:47.909> head<00:01:48.119> might<00:01:48.329> go<00:01:48.570> such<00:01:48.899> be<00:01:49.079> a<00:01:49.110> huge<00:01:49.409> draw<00:01:49.740> on

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
the head might go such be a huge draw on

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.069 
the head might go such be a huge draw on
top<00:01:50.070> of<00:01:50.159> the<00:01:50.220> body<00:01:50.509> and<00:01:51.509> with<00:01:51.630> a<00:01:51.659> light<00:01:51.840> tap

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
top of the body and with a light tap

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:53.330 
top of the body and with a light tap
that<00:01:52.259> you<00:01:52.380> know<00:01:52.470> the<00:01:52.680> head<00:01:52.860> the<00:01:53.040> draw<00:01:53.189> it

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
that you know the head the draw it

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.039 
that you know the head the draw it
disappear<00:01:53.670> completely<00:01:53.759> inch<00:01:54.090> come<00:01:54.420> cover<00:01:54.600> and

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
disappear completely inch come cover and

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:57.469 
disappear completely inch come cover and
Jack<00:01:55.380> Pokemon<00:01:55.890> us<00:01:55.979> with<00:01:56.189> that<00:01:56.299> so<00:01:57.299> it's

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
Jack Pokemon us with that so it's

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:00.380 
Jack Pokemon us with that so it's
definitely<00:01:57.780> an<00:01:57.869> interesting<00:01:58.079> idea<00:01:59.240> next<00:02:00.240> up<00:02:00.360> i

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
definitely an interesting idea next up i

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.300 
definitely an interesting idea next up i
selected<00:02:00.840> talk<00:02:01.049> or<00:02:01.229> I'll<00:02:01.350> here<00:02:01.560> now<00:02:02.070> at<00:02:02.250> the

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
selected talk or I'll here now at the

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:03.859 
selected talk or I'll here now at the
moment<00:02:02.549> is<00:02:02.610> just<00:02:02.759> a<00:02:02.850> single<00:02:03.060> Pokemon<00:02:03.630> no

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869

evolutions<00:02:04.320> of<00:02:04.439> pre<00:02:04.619> religions<00:02:04.950> at<00:02:05.100> all<00:02:05.369> I

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
evolutions of pre religions at all I

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:06.950 
evolutions of pre religions at all I
think<00:02:06.090> it<00:02:06.210> should<00:02:06.329> definitely<00:02:06.390> get<00:02:06.750> one

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
think it should definitely get one

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.080 
think it should definitely get one
though<00:02:07.140> because<00:02:07.619> it's<00:02:08.069> got<00:02:08.310> you<00:02:08.520> know<00:02:08.580> again<00:02:08.849> a

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
though because it's got you know again a

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:10.460 
though because it's got you know again a
bit<00:02:09.300> of<00:02:09.360> potential<00:02:09.750> there<00:02:09.780> it's<00:02:10.050> a<00:02:10.110> volcano

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
bit of potential there it's a volcano

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.199 
bit of potential there it's a volcano
hook<00:02:10.709> alone<00:02:10.920> so<00:02:11.370> maybe<00:02:11.520> no<00:02:11.760> make<00:02:11.970> it<00:02:12.000> a<00:02:12.120> bit

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
hook alone so maybe no make it a bit

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:13.130 
hook alone so maybe no make it a bit
bigger<00:02:12.420> acts

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
bigger acts

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:14.809

you<00:02:13.290> make<00:02:13.440> the<00:02:13.590> back<00:02:13.740> on<00:02:13.950> its<00:02:14.069> cut<00:02:14.310> the<00:02:14.460> back<00:02:14.640> is

00:02:14.809 --> 00:02:14.819 
you make the back on its cut the back is

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:16.730 
you make the back on its cut the back is
designed<00:02:15.090> as<00:02:15.210> an<00:02:15.360> oven<00:02:15.510> so<00:02:16.290> maybe<00:02:16.500> you<00:02:16.620> know

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:16.740 
designed as an oven so maybe you know

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:18.530 
designed as an oven so maybe you know
make<00:02:16.980> an<00:02:17.130> open<00:02:17.490> oven<00:02:17.640> make<00:02:17.940> a<00:02:17.970> huge<00:02:18.240> hole<00:02:18.510> in

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
make an open oven make a huge hole in

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:19.970 
make an open oven make a huge hole in
its<00:02:18.810> back<00:02:18.990> that<00:02:19.290> you<00:02:19.380> know<00:02:19.470> fire<00:02:19.770> is<00:02:19.950> just

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
its back that you know fire is just

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.520 
its back that you know fire is just
burning<00:02:20.550> out<00:02:20.670> of<00:02:21.080> two<00:02:22.080> can't<00:02:22.230> get<00:02:22.410> rid<00:02:22.500> of

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
burning out of two can't get rid of

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:24.890 
burning out of two can't get rid of
smoke<00:02:22.830> and<00:02:23.069> it's<00:02:23.970> definitely<00:02:24.360> not<00:02:24.480> you<00:02:24.750> know

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
smoke and it's definitely not you know

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:26.510 
smoke and it's definitely not you know
i'd<00:02:25.200> like<00:02:25.380> to<00:02:25.530> see<00:02:25.680> any<00:02:25.830> evolution<00:02:26.190> for<00:02:26.310> it's<00:02:26.400> a

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:26.520 
i'd like to see any evolution for it's a

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:28.850 
i'd like to see any evolution for it's a
bit<00:02:26.819> more<00:02:26.940> usable<00:02:27.480> maybe<00:02:28.020> add<00:02:28.230> the<00:02:28.410> rock<00:02:28.590> type

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
bit more usable maybe add the rock type

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:30.890 
bit more usable maybe add the rock type
to<00:02:29.040> it<00:02:29.190> i'd<00:02:29.310> like<00:02:29.580> to<00:02:29.730> see<00:02:29.940> or<00:02:30.480> maybe<00:02:30.630> another

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
to it i'd like to see or maybe another

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:32.690 
to it i'd like to see or maybe another
type<00:02:31.200> like<00:02:31.470> a<00:02:31.620> ground<00:02:31.980> not<00:02:32.340> necessarily

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
type like a ground not necessarily

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.070 
type like a ground not necessarily
ground<00:02:33.000> type<00:02:33.209> though<00:02:33.360> because<00:02:33.480> you<00:02:33.630> have<00:02:33.780> you

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
ground type though because you have you

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:35.720 
ground type though because you have you
know<00:02:34.170> camerupt<00:02:34.770> a<00:02:34.950> new<00:02:35.100> mail<00:02:35.280> from<00:02:35.430> the<00:02:35.550> same

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
know camerupt a new mail from the same

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:39.860 
know camerupt a new mail from the same
generation<00:02:36.420> you<00:02:37.050> know<00:02:37.080> but<00:02:37.920> who<00:02:38.070> knows<00:02:38.870> now

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
generation you know but who knows now

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:41.390 
generation you know but who knows now
I've<00:02:40.020> selected<00:02:40.170> spinder<00:02:40.830> here<00:02:41.010> I<00:02:41.160> think

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
I've selected spinder here I think

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:42.920 
I've selected spinder here I think
spindash<00:02:41.790> definitely<00:02:42.180> an<00:02:42.239> evolution<00:02:42.750> because

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
spindash definitely an evolution because

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:44.660 
spindash definitely an evolution because
it's<00:02:43.380> on<00:02:43.860> its<00:02:44.010> own<00:02:44.100> at<00:02:44.190> the<00:02:44.250> moment<00:02:44.280> so<00:02:44.550> it's

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
it's on its own at the moment so it's

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:47.390 
it's on its own at the moment so it's
not<00:02:44.730> usable<00:02:45.239> at<00:02:45.270> already<00:02:45.900> and<00:02:46.770> you<00:02:47.100> know<00:02:47.220> an

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
not usable at already and you know an

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:48.830 
not usable at already and you know an
evolution<00:02:47.790> will<00:02:47.910> be<00:02:47.940> good<00:02:48.180> because<00:02:48.390> then<00:02:48.690> you

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
evolution will be good because then you

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:51.320 
evolution will be good because then you
get<00:02:49.020> individual<00:02:49.890> patterns<00:02:50.070> for<00:02:50.550> it<00:02:50.700> like

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.330 
get individual patterns for it like

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:54.380 
get individual patterns for it like
spinder<00:02:51.900> so<00:02:52.590> you<00:02:52.650> know<00:02:52.890> maybe<00:02:53.120> make<00:02:54.120> it<00:02:54.150> a<00:02:54.269> bit

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 
spinder so you know maybe make it a bit

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:56.810 
spinder so you know maybe make it a bit
bigger<00:02:54.570> add<00:02:55.410> some<00:02:55.800> more<00:02:55.920> designs<00:02:56.220> to<00:02:56.430> it<00:02:56.580> so<00:02:56.760> it

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:56.820 
bigger add some more designs to it so it

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:58.850 
bigger add some more designs to it so it
can<00:02:56.850> have<00:02:57.060> bit<00:02:57.360> vetted<00:02:57.780> pattern<00:02:58.290> patterning

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:58.860 
can have bit vetted pattern patterning

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:01.640 
can have bit vetted pattern patterning
awesome<00:02:59.070> app<00:02:59.300> who<00:03:00.300> knows<00:03:00.590> it<00:03:01.590> could

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
awesome app who knows it could

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:04.449 
awesome app who knows it could
definitely<00:03:02.310> though<00:03:03.000> I<00:03:03.180> would<00:03:03.300> like<00:03:03.450> to<00:03:03.480> see<00:03:03.810> it

00:03:04.449 --> 00:03:04.459 
definitely though I would like to see it

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:06.949 
definitely though I would like to see it
now<00:03:05.459> we<00:03:05.519> have<00:03:05.820> a<00:03:05.850> design<00:03:06.060> goose<00:03:06.480> now<00:03:06.690> I<00:03:06.720> think

00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:06.959 
now we have a design goose now I think

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:08.600 
now we have a design goose now I think
xango<00:03:07.350> should<00:03:07.530> definitely<00:03:07.980> any<00:03:08.160> evolution

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:08.610 
xango should definitely any evolution

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:10.490 
xango should definitely any evolution
because<00:03:09.060> it's<00:03:09.570> got<00:03:09.780> again<00:03:10.080> a<00:03:10.110> lot<00:03:10.410> of

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
because it's got again a lot of

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.680 
because it's got again a lot of
potential<00:03:10.830> the<00:03:11.519> claws<00:03:11.820> could<00:03:12.090> get<00:03:12.239> so<00:03:12.510> much

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:12.690 
potential the claws could get so much

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:15.020 
potential the claws could get so much
bigger<00:03:12.930> she<00:03:13.380> can<00:03:13.560> imagine<00:03:13.739> a<00:03:13.920> huge<00:03:14.280> claws<00:03:14.730> just

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 
bigger she can imagine a huge claws just

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:17.600 
bigger she can imagine a huge claws just
sticking<00:03:15.390> out<00:03:15.480> his<00:03:15.600> hands<00:03:16.280> give<00:03:17.280> it<00:03:17.400> some<00:03:17.579> more

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:17.610 
sticking out his hands give it some more

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:19.880 
sticking out his hands give it some more
awesome<00:03:18.450> design<00:03:18.780> on<00:03:18.989> its<00:03:19.140> face<00:03:19.350> and<00:03:19.620> stuff

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:19.890 
awesome design on its face and stuff

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:23.090 
awesome design on its face and stuff
tail<00:03:20.930> could<00:03:21.930> probably<00:03:22.260> add<00:03:22.440> a<00:03:22.470> spike<00:03:22.860> to<00:03:23.040> the

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:23.100 
tail could probably add a spike to the

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:25.550 
tail could probably add a spike to the
tail<00:03:23.310> who<00:03:23.489> knows<00:03:23.870> and<00:03:24.870> obviously<00:03:25.290> want<00:03:25.530> to

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560 
tail who knows and obviously want to

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:27.020 
tail who knows and obviously want to
keep<00:03:25.709> it<00:03:25.799> being<00:03:25.950> agile<00:03:26.310> but<00:03:26.610> also<00:03:26.730> want<00:03:26.970> to

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:27.030 
keep it being agile but also want to

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:29.479 
keep it being agile but also want to
make<00:03:27.090> it<00:03:27.239> larger<00:03:27.570> and<00:03:27.600> more<00:03:27.780> powerful<00:03:28.459> so<00:03:29.459> a

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:29.489 
make it larger and more powerful so a

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:31.310 
make it larger and more powerful so a
good<00:03:29.730> mix<00:03:29.940> between<00:03:30.120> those<00:03:30.420> two<00:03:30.600> would<00:03:31.140> be

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:31.320 
good mix between those two would be

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:33.259 
good mix between those two would be
pretty<00:03:31.560> good<00:03:31.709> damn<00:03:31.920> pretty<00:03:32.250> damn<00:03:32.549> good<00:03:32.790> to<00:03:33.060> see

00:03:33.259 --> 00:03:33.269 
pretty good damn pretty damn good to see

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:36.199 
pretty good damn pretty damn good to see
and<00:03:34.010> now<00:03:35.010> because<00:03:35.370> we<00:03:35.489> give<00:03:35.610> you<00:03:35.700> at<00:03:35.790> least<00:03:35.820> I'm

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:36.209 
and now because we give you at least I'm

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:37.400 
and now because we give you at least I'm
saying<00:03:36.420> do<00:03:36.510> is<00:03:36.600> an<00:03:36.720> evolution<00:03:37.140> we<00:03:37.260> should

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:37.410 
saying do is an evolution we should

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:38.660 
saying do is an evolution we should
definitely<00:03:37.590> survived<00:03:38.040> for<00:03:38.070> an<00:03:38.250> evolution

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:38.670 
definitely survived for an evolution

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:42.080 
definitely survived for an evolution
because<00:03:38.820> you<00:03:39.060> know<00:03:39.209> they<00:03:39.600> are<00:03:40.340> rivals<00:03:41.340> so<00:03:41.610> if

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.090 
because you know they are rivals so if

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:44.240 
because you know they are rivals so if
one<00:03:42.329> gets<00:03:42.420> new<00:03:42.630> version<00:03:42.930> the<00:03:43.019> airship<00:03:43.320> to<00:03:43.530> so

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:44.250 
one gets new version the airship to so

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:46.100 
one gets new version the airship to so
survivor<00:03:44.549> has<00:03:44.880> again<00:03:45.209> a<00:03:45.239> bit<00:03:45.450> potential<00:03:45.900> for

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:46.110 
survivor has again a bit potential for

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:48.350 
survivor has again a bit potential for
an<00:03:46.230> evolution<00:03:46.680> here<00:03:46.890> it<00:03:47.519> could<00:03:47.700> get<00:03:47.820> bigger<00:03:48.120> it

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:48.360 
an evolution here it could get bigger it

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:49.970 
an evolution here it could get bigger it
can<00:03:48.510> you<00:03:48.690> know<00:03:48.750> end<00:03:49.019> up<00:03:49.230> standing<00:03:49.500> just<00:03:49.799> kind

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:49.980 
can you know end up standing just kind

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:51.650 
can you know end up standing just kind
of<00:03:50.010> on<00:03:50.430> its<00:03:50.610> tail<00:03:50.850> bit<00:03:51.120> instead<00:03:51.390> of<00:03:51.510> being

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:51.660 
of on its tail bit instead of being

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:53.890 
of on its tail bit instead of being
along<00:03:52.320> the<00:03:52.410> ground<00:03:52.620> so<00:03:52.890> like<00:03:53.070> our<00:03:53.280> Bob<00:03:53.549> does

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:53.900 
along the ground so like our Bob does

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:56.690 
along the ground so like our Bob does
its<00:03:54.900> fangs<00:03:55.200> we<00:03:55.410> get<00:03:55.590> a<00:03:55.620> bit<00:03:56.130> bigger<00:03:56.430> it's<00:03:56.610> not

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:56.700 
its fangs we get a bit bigger it's not

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:58.160 
its fangs we get a bit bigger it's not
they're<00:03:56.880> all<00:03:57.000> pretty<00:03:57.150> big<00:03:57.360> right<00:03:57.510> now<00:03:57.570> but<00:03:58.049> you

00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:58.170 
they're all pretty big right now but you

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:00.620 
they're all pretty big right now but you
know<00:03:58.320> and<00:03:58.560> its<00:03:59.070> tail<00:03:59.370> you<00:03:59.549> could<00:03:59.700> can<00:03:59.970> you<00:04:00.299> know

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:00.630 
know and its tail you could can you know

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:03.259 
know and its tail you could can you know
um<00:04:00.900> instead<00:04:01.890> of<00:04:01.950> being<00:04:02.160> in<00:04:02.280> one<00:04:02.610> glazed<00:04:02.940> sort

00:04:03.259 --> 00:04:03.269 
um instead of being in one glazed sort

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:04.640 
um instead of being in one glazed sort
of<00:04:03.329> could<00:04:03.510> have<00:04:03.630> blades<00:04:03.930> on<00:04:04.140> the<00:04:04.230> side<00:04:04.440> of<00:04:04.470> it

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:04.650 
of could have blades on the side of it

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:06.140 
of could have blades on the side of it
I'm<00:04:05.130> thinking<00:04:05.280> of<00:04:05.489> the<00:04:05.549> way<00:04:05.640> from<00:04:05.700> Torchwood

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.150 
I'm thinking of the way from Torchwood

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:07.460 
I'm thinking of the way from Torchwood
hit<00:04:06.390> if<00:04:06.480> any<00:04:06.600> of<00:04:06.660> you<00:04:06.780> seen<00:04:06.989> it<00:04:07.110> it's<00:04:07.290> in<00:04:07.380> the

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:07.470 
hit if any of you seen it it's in the

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:10.280 
hit if any of you seen it it's in the
first<00:04:07.620> episode<00:04:08.750> second<00:04:09.750> episode<00:04:09.930> first

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:10.290 
first episode second episode first

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:12.860 
first episode second episode first
episode<00:04:10.680> um<00:04:11.060> it's<00:04:12.060> kind<00:04:12.269> of<00:04:12.299> like<00:04:12.480> the<00:04:12.720> main

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:12.870 
episode um it's kind of like the main

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:15.319 
episode um it's kind of like the main
blade<00:04:13.170> it's<00:04:13.680> got<00:04:13.890> two<00:04:14.070> sharper<00:04:14.549> blade<00:04:14.730> or<00:04:14.910> 2x

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:15.329 
blade it's got two sharper blade or 2x

00:04:15.329 --> 00:04:16.759 
blade it's got two sharper blade or 2x
movie-based<00:04:15.660> sticking<00:04:16.140> off<00:04:16.200> the<00:04:16.320> sides<00:04:16.530> of<00:04:16.680> it

00:04:16.759 --> 00:04:16.769 
movie-based sticking off the sides of it

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:18.620 
movie-based sticking off the sides of it
which<00:04:17.310> we're<00:04:17.519> deadly<00:04:17.820> weapons<00:04:18.150> so<00:04:18.299> maybe<00:04:18.450> it's

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:18.630 
which we're deadly weapons so maybe it's

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:19.960 
which we're deadly weapons so maybe it's
maybe<00:04:18.840> some<00:04:18.989> of<00:04:19.079> that

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:19.970 
maybe some of that

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:22.600 
maybe some of that
and<00:04:20.410> next<00:04:21.410> up<00:04:21.560> we<00:04:21.650> have<00:04:21.680> AB<00:04:21.980> soul<00:04:22.310> I<00:04:22.430> think

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:22.610 
and next up we have AB soul I think

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:24.730 
and next up we have AB soul I think
absol<00:04:23.030> should<00:04:23.150> get<00:04:23.270> an<00:04:23.360> evolution<00:04:23.810> just

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:24.740 
absol should get an evolution just

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:26.710 
absol should get an evolution just
because<00:04:25.100> it's<00:04:25.580> got<00:04:25.670> against<00:04:26.060> potential<00:04:26.540> is

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:26.720 
because it's got against potential is

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:29.500 
because it's got against potential is
loved<00:04:26.990> by<00:04:27.080> so<00:04:27.350> many<00:04:27.380> fans<00:04:27.770> and<00:04:28.090> an<00:04:29.090> illusion

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:29.510 
loved by so many fans and an illusion

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:31.750 
loved by so many fans and an illusion
for<00:04:29.600> it<00:04:29.720> will<00:04:29.840> look<00:04:29.990> pretty<00:04:30.230> cool<00:04:30.380> i<00:04:30.440> think<00:04:30.760> its

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:31.760 
for it will look pretty cool i think its

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:34.690 
for it will look pretty cool i think its
size<00:04:32.090> could<00:04:32.330> get<00:04:32.450> a<00:04:32.480> lot<00:04:32.690> bigger<00:04:33.430> maybe<00:04:34.430> like

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:34.700 
size could get a lot bigger maybe like

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:36.370 
size could get a lot bigger maybe like
twist<00:04:35.180> it<00:04:35.330> further<00:04:35.540> around<00:04:35.810> its<00:04:35.960> head<00:04:36.140> so<00:04:36.290> it's

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:36.380 
twist it further around its head so it's

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:38.620 
twist it further around its head so it's
kind<00:04:36.530> of<00:04:36.590> like<00:04:36.680> a<00:04:36.740> whole<00:04:37.040> semicircle<00:04:37.880> and<00:04:37.970> you

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:38.630 
kind of like a whole semicircle and you

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:40.420 
kind of like a whole semicircle and you
know<00:04:38.720> it<00:04:38.900> might<00:04:39.020> might<00:04:39.620> look<00:04:39.680> stupid<00:04:40.160> but<00:04:40.370> um

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:40.430 
know it might might look stupid but um

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:42.160 
know it might might look stupid but um
it<00:04:40.790> might<00:04:41.030> look<00:04:41.150> good<00:04:41.210> at<00:04:41.450> the<00:04:41.480> same<00:04:41.720> time<00:04:41.930> and

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:42.170 
it might look good at the same time and

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:43.900 
it might look good at the same time and
you<00:04:42.710> could<00:04:42.890> make<00:04:43.100> it<00:04:43.220> sort<00:04:43.430> of<00:04:43.460> like<00:04:43.670> I'm

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:43.910 
you could make it sort of like I'm

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:46.750 
you could make it sort of like I'm
usable<00:04:44.720> and<00:04:44.840> such<00:04:45.080> in<00:04:45.350> some<00:04:46.190> way<00:04:46.340> shape<00:04:46.370> or

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:46.760 
usable and such in some way shape or
