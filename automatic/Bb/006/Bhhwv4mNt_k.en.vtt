right away I'm playing this guy and I

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:37.710 
right away I'm playing this guy and I

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:43.200 
could tell that he wanted to run the
ball<00:00:37.870> and<00:00:38.430> so<00:00:39.430> um<00:00:40.710> stop<00:00:41.710> him<00:00:41.920> there<00:00:42.130> and<00:00:42.400> I

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:43.210 
ball and so um stop him there and I

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:48.420 
ball and so um stop him there and I
force<00:00:43.660> along<00:00:44.290> third<00:00:44.620> down<00:00:44.920> and<00:00:45.360> I<00:00:46.740> had<00:00:47.740> good<00:00:47.950> I

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:48.430 
force along third down and I had good I

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:51.390 
force along third down and I had good I
had<00:00:48.670> good<00:00:48.880> pass<00:00:49.120> coverage<00:00:49.420> there<00:00:49.780> to<00:00:50.220> stop<00:00:51.220> him

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:51.400 
had good pass coverage there to stop him

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:55.920 
had good pass coverage there to stop him
so<00:00:51.790> he<00:00:51.940> ended<00:00:52.180> up<00:00:52.270> punting<00:00:52.600> and<00:00:54.510> the<00:00:55.510> previous

so he ended up punting and the previous

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:57.870 
so he ended up punting and the previous
games<00:00:56.380> I<00:00:56.680> had<00:00:56.860> thrown<00:00:57.130> kind<00:00:57.430> of<00:00:57.550> a<00:00:57.610> lot<00:00:57.760> of

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:57.880 
games I had thrown kind of a lot of

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:00.000 
games I had thrown kind of a lot of
interception<00:00:58.510> so<00:00:58.810> I<00:00:58.840> really<00:00:59.410> wanted<00:00:59.740> to<00:00:59.800> get

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:00.010 
interception so I really wanted to get

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:01.560 
interception so I really wanted to get
my<00:01:00.130> run<00:01:00.340> game<00:01:00.550> going<00:01:00.580> to<00:01:01.060> open<00:01:01.270> up<00:01:01.420> the

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:01.570 
my run game going to open up the

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:04.860 
my run game going to open up the
passport<00:01:01.980> open<00:01:02.980> up<00:01:03.070> the<00:01:03.220> past<00:01:03.460> and<00:01:03.870> that's

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:04.870 
passport open up the past and that's

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:08.180 
passport open up the past and that's
exactly<00:01:05.140> what<00:01:05.800> I<00:01:05.830> did<00:01:06.480> but<00:01:07.480> unfortunately

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:08.190 
exactly what I did but unfortunately

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:12.510 
exactly what I did but unfortunately
there<00:01:09.190> I<00:01:09.550> couldn't<00:01:10.240> come<00:01:10.510> up<00:01:10.690> with<00:01:10.900> a<00:01:11.710> first

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:12.520 
there I couldn't come up with a first

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:15.510 
there I couldn't come up with a first
down<00:01:12.790> and<00:01:13.180> so<00:01:13.390> I<00:01:13.420> ended<00:01:14.140> up<00:01:14.710> passing<00:01:15.010> the<00:01:15.370> ball

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:15.520 
down and so I ended up passing the ball

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
down and so I ended up passing the ball
or<00:01:15.820> punted<00:01:16.420> the<00:01:16.480> ball<00:01:16.600> excuse<00:01:16.990> me<00:01:17.170> and<00:01:18.540> again

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:19.540 
or punted the ball excuse me and again

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:21.630 
or punted the ball excuse me and again
he's<00:01:19.720> running<00:01:20.110> and<00:01:20.650> he<00:01:20.890> actually<00:01:21.040> fumbles

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:21.640 
he's running and he actually fumbles

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:23.310 
he's running and he actually fumbles
they're<00:01:21.880> giving<00:01:22.270> me<00:01:22.390> really<00:01:22.659> good<00:01:23.020> field

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:23.320 
they're giving me really good field

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:26.390 
they're giving me really good field
position<00:01:23.850> set<00:01:24.850> me<00:01:25.030> up<00:01:25.060> to<00:01:25.180> score<00:01:25.690> but

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
position set me up to score but

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.399 
position set me up to score but
unfortunately<00:01:27.400> here<00:01:27.909> on<00:01:28.180> third<00:01:28.450> down<00:01:28.720> I<00:01:28.750> can't

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:29.409 
unfortunately here on third down I can't

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:33.600 
unfortunately here on third down I can't
convert<00:01:30.010> and<00:01:30.750> so<00:01:31.750> I<00:01:32.200> end<00:01:32.830> up<00:01:32.950> just<00:01:33.130> kicking<00:01:33.490> the

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:33.610 
convert and so I end up just kicking the

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:35.940 
convert and so I end up just kicking the
field<00:01:33.820> goal<00:01:34.090> I'm<00:01:34.510> getting<00:01:35.020> myself<00:01:35.260> three

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:35.950

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:42.580 
points on the board and so unfortunately

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:45.539 
points on the board and so unfortunately
I'm<00:01:43.360> not<00:01:43.420> really<00:01:44.260> taking<00:01:44.590> advantage<00:01:44.830> of<00:01:45.400> the

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:45.549 
I'm not really taking advantage of the

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:48.990 
I'm not really taking advantage of the
good<00:01:46.229> field<00:01:47.229> position<00:01:47.350> i<00:01:47.860> had<00:01:48.040> but<00:01:48.520> um<00:01:48.700> i

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:49.000 
good field position i had but um i

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.240 
good field position i had but um i
continue<00:01:49.930> to<00:01:50.200> run<00:01:50.380> the<00:01:50.530> ball<00:01:50.680> which<00:01:51.040> not<00:01:51.580> only

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
continue to run the ball which not only

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.399 
continue to run the ball which not only
runs<00:01:54.250> o'clock<00:01:54.640> but<00:01:54.909> it's<00:01:55.060> also<00:01:55.240> given<00:01:55.690> me<00:01:55.870> good

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:56.409 
runs o'clock but it's also given me good

00:01:56.409 --> 00:02:00.990 
runs o'clock but it's also given me good
yardage<00:01:57.420> and<00:01:59.070> as<00:02:00.070> you<00:02:00.190> can<00:02:00.310> see<00:02:00.340> here<00:02:00.790> it's

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:01.000 
yardage and as you can see here it's

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.730 
yardage and as you can see here it's
being<00:02:01.450> pretty<00:02:01.690> effective<00:02:02.229> against<00:02:02.619> his

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:02.740 
being pretty effective against his

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:04.980 
being pretty effective against his
defense<00:02:03.250> i<00:02:03.549> keep<00:02:04.180> on<00:02:04.299> getting<00:02:04.360> first<00:02:04.810> down

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:04.990 
defense i keep on getting first down

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:07.649 
defense i keep on getting first down
after<00:02:05.260> first<00:02:05.500> down<00:02:05.740> till<00:02:06.520> here<00:02:06.790> big<00:02:07.150> third<00:02:07.450> and

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:07.659 
after first down till here big third and

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:09.150 
after first down till here big third and
12<00:02:07.780> play

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:09.160

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:12.710 
12 play
and<00:02:09.370> i<00:02:10.300> end<00:02:10.750> up<00:02:10.900> with<00:02:10.960> the<00:02:11.290> completion<00:02:12.190> and

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
and i end up with the completion and

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.300 
and i end up with the completion and
here<00:02:13.720> for<00:02:14.140> thing<00:02:14.410> go<00:02:14.530> on<00:02:14.710> the<00:02:14.830> one-yard<00:02:15.250> line

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
here for thing go on the one-yard line

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:17.160 
here for thing go on the one-yard line
you'd<00:02:15.670> think<00:02:15.850> that<00:02:16.090> a<00:02:16.120> QB<00:02:16.510> sneak<00:02:16.570> would<00:02:16.930> work

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.170 
you'd think that a QB sneak would work

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:20.910 
you'd think that a QB sneak would work
and<00:02:18.130> she<00:02:18.370> actually<00:02:18.550> ends<00:02:19.090> up<00:02:19.150> stopping<00:02:19.480> me<00:02:19.930> so

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920 
and she actually ends up stopping me so

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:24.930

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:21.130 
is my first wanted the series for this

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:23.250

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:26.440 
times on that involve so it's always the

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:30.030 
times on that involve so it's always the
nice<00:03:27.600> nice<00:03:28.600> bonus<00:03:29.110> if<00:03:29.290> you<00:03:29.380> can<00:03:29.530> return<00:03:29.830> the
