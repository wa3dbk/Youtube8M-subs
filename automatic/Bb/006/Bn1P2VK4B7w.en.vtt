traveling and learning through that it

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.100 
traveling and learning through that it
really<00:01:41.400> is<00:01:41.579> the<00:01:41.729> best<00:01:41.759> way<00:01:42.090> to<00:01:42.150> learn<00:01:42.360> but

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
really is the best way to learn but

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.830 
really is the best way to learn but
anyway<00:01:43.500> got<00:01:43.920> sidetracked<00:01:44.159> a<00:01:44.460> little<00:01:44.670> bit<00:01:44.840> my

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840
