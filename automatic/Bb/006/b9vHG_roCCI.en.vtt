you

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:27.900 

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:30.680 

and<00:05:28.500> you<00:05:29.040> should<00:05:29.340> have<00:05:29.430> lost<00:05:29.790> them<00:05:30.150> I<00:05:30.389> think

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:30.690 
and you should have lost them I think

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:33.890 
and you should have lost them I think
the<00:05:30.870> game<00:05:31.520> makes<00:05:32.520> you<00:05:32.699> lose<00:05:33.000> Victor<00:05:33.600> by<00:05:33.840> the

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:33.900 
the game makes you lose Victor by the

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:36.999 
the game makes you lose Victor by the
time<00:05:34.229> you<00:05:34.380> get<00:05:34.500> to<00:05:34.560> off<00:05:35.280> the<00:05:35.610> highway

00:05:36.999 --> 00:05:37.009 
time you get to off the highway

00:05:37.009 --> 00:05:41.320 
time you get to off the highway
so<00:05:37.669> you<00:05:37.789> should<00:05:37.999> have<00:05:38.119> cost<00:05:38.389> them<00:05:38.629> by<00:05:38.809> now<00:05:40.330> I'd

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:41.330 
so you should have cost them by now I'd

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:43.059 
so you should have cost them by now I'd
still<00:05:41.629> be<00:05:41.659> careful<00:05:41.960> from<00:05:42.319> their<00:05:42.559> needs<00:05:42.770> that

00:05:43.059 --> 00:05:43.069 
still be careful from their needs that

00:05:43.069 --> 00:05:45.260 
still be careful from their needs that
they<00:05:43.099> might<00:05:43.369> grow

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:45.270 
they might grow

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:47.330 
they might grow
but<00:05:45.900> you<00:05:46.050> can<00:05:46.200> never<00:05:46.290> predict<00:05:46.860> them<00:05:47.040> so<00:05:47.280> you

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:47.340 
but you can never predict them so you

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:50.970 
but you can never predict them so you
just<00:05:47.550> want<00:05:47.760> to<00:05:47.820> be<00:05:47.910> saved

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:50.980 

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:53.640 

just<00:05:51.550> drive<00:05:52.150> back<00:05:52.330> to<00:05:52.480> the<00:05:52.600> church<00:05:52.780> I<00:05:53.080> strike

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:53.650 
just drive back to the church I strike

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:57.960 
just drive back to the church I strike
you<00:05:54.460> saved<00:05:54.790> our<00:05:54.940> ass<00:05:55.290> and<00:05:56.310> that<00:05:57.310> is<00:05:57.460> the<00:05:57.790> end<00:05:57.880> of

00:05:57.960 --> 00:05:57.970 
you saved our ass and that is the end of

00:05:57.970 --> 00:06:00.150 
you saved our ass and that is the end of
the<00:05:58.060> mission<00:05:58.320> so<00:05:59.320> you<00:05:59.410> should<00:05:59.680> get<00:05:59.830> around<00:06:00.040> a

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:00.160 
the mission so you should get around a

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:03.270 
the mission so you should get around a
thousand<00:06:00.610> dollars<00:06:00.880> in<00:06:01.030> cash
