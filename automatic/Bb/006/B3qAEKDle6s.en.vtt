00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:06.069
 ah 

00:00:03.069 --> 00:00:06.069
 how 

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:12.680
 ah 

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:15.590
 ah 

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:17.540
 or the people I am that fits him but also 

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:19.190
 known as desmond and this that 

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:23.060
 it would seem that it is a trick that 

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:25.880
 said a subscriber called c7 crocs and 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:28.940
 you have your video in the description that 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:30.140
 explains about this and he did good 

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:32.540
 he said if he could make a video and well 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:35.390
 so let's make the video it's about 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:37.580
 a timer so you experience 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:39.290
 I'm going to show it right now and then 

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:40.790
 I explain a little how it works and this 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:43.699
 map you will have it in the description vale 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:46.040
 first as project survival is worth and 

00:00:43.699 --> 00:00:48.140
 when I give you here 4 after 2 minutes in 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:50.210
 actually this is false is the account 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:52.910
 back of 20 seconds because we can 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:54.980
 modify it as we want it to be worth 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:56.899
 20 seconds this I do the button and if you 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:59.149
 you look at the experience puts 20 

00:00:56.899 --> 00:01:00.559
 seconds then well this countdown 

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:02.899
 it can be for anything for a 

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:05.479
 lobby for any nonsense such an echo 

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:07.759
 is that you need the clock as always 

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:10.479
 and well, it is not very efficient and 

00:01:07.759 --> 00:01:10.479
 when it ends then 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:19.200
 and fireworks for climbing the 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.520
 volume over there but explain another 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.520
 Once they did what we are going to see from here 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.420
 it's good for you to see how this works 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.860
 basically what you are doing is 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.050
 generating a rest pulse although it is 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.090
 adding good is removing then 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:33.900
 experience not ours that are of 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:35.070
 experience and when it reaches 4 then it 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.870
 active is here that the 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:41.490
 sounds 

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:43.730
 now sativa this and it's going to create everything 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:47.340
 ok then I'll put in creative 

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:49.370
 here and I'm going to point out first good and 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.780
 first this from here good let's give it 

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:53.790
 it is activated but then it was removed 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:58.320
 This is what is a watch that there 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:02:00.870
 here are clock and here we have the xp -1 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.910
 ok then to start it's all here 

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:04.950
 this system here when the button 

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:07.080
 what he does is add us he adds 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:09.810
 20 of experience this you see here 21 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:12.260
 well I put 21 but but if you put 20 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:15.150
 then it is already then once it adds 20 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:16.680
 it takes everything away from the experience and 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:19.410
 this here this command generates a 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:21.930
 rest block here therefore 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:23.760
 will start an account and start a watch 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:25.260
 or rather not and therefore every time 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:27.450
 that a block is generated because it's going 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.980
 removing less a level is worth less 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:31.080
 level minus one level minus level like that 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:33.420
 all the time the very easy command xp 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:35.500
 minus one and one ll I wanted to tell you 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:38.110
 level is worth the level 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:40.060
 and when I got here when I got to 4 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:43.420
 It is a text that I already taught him in a 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:45.370
 very old video already also when when 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:47.940
 reach this level what it does is good 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:50.130
 some sounds of 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:51.780
 now some sounds that will tell us that 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:54.000
 there are three seconds left and then at 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:55.770
 end when you reach the minimum of one 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.370
 then this will be activated that what it does 

00:02:55.770 --> 00:03:01.770
 here generates a firework worth and 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:03.930
 here what makes you sick of that 

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:07.050
 this system the clock removes it and 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:09.300
 then at the end of everything, remove it again 

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:11.970
 and it puts me this puts the experience to me 

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:14.160
 zero again worth it here if this is 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:16.680
 lower 100 that I subtracted 100 from 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:18.030
 experience therefore 0 and well then 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:19.350
 this is the trick I have more to 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:21.090
 lots in the description and I that 

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:22.950
 you would try it here I put a 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:26.820
 survival I give the button and as you see 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:28.470
 Well, it starts to work, good and good 

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:31.500
 so let's do this parkour that says 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:33.960
 here super difficult as my god if not 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:36.900
 it's hard or my god how hard or god 

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:39.980
 mine and last one 360 ​​turn and that 's it 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:39.980
 I did it before time 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:45.800
 then you have the map in the description if 

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:47.570
 you want to try it for your own 

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:50.000
 account for them I say it's super 

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:52.010
 super super simple to do this and I say 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.230
 for a lobby to start a for 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:57.350
 example a pvp game is very good and 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:59.840
 it is very simple besides this watch is 

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:02.000
 generates only when you press the button and 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:03.830
 then it turns off when when the 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.410
 count to zero as it goes out and does not return 

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:08.030
 to appear in any good throughout 

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:10.640
 the game therefore will not generate 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:12.530
 the so the map you have the 

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:14.480
 description it is best that you try it and 

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:17.000
 this system since there is this here of 

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:19.880
 Here you can copy it and paste it 

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:23.300
 in your world and make you scratch 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:24.740
 I'm going to mark here it's worth with a sign 

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:26.180
 Well, I'm going to mark the commands 

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:28.010
 what do you have to change with these 

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:30.230
 little flowers and now I will put the wool 

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:32.990
 to explain where the changes are going 

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:34.670
 this here is worth this here what 

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:36.440
 is to generate a block of crestón there 

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:39.020
 over on so I'm going to put that 

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:40.610
 wool and here is the one below that makes 

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:44.150
 is to create an air block generates it 

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:46.280
 here here it's worth and we're going to see this one 

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:50.470
 here that makes this here I will see 

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:52.380
 this one here 60 to see 

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:54.970
 worth this here generates a block of 

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:58.000
 air here 

00:04:54.970 --> 00:05:00.010
 and the last one we have the experience is worth 

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.420
 because you you have to change exhibiting at 

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:03.160
 this one here you have to put these 

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:05.470
 coordinates of this block in this 

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:07.060
 block down here in this one as in 

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:09.640
 blog from here you have to change those 

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:11.140
 coordinates for being here and in the 

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:12.850
 last you have to change the coordinates of 

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:15.700
 this one here is valid and then for 

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:17.230
 finalize there is this command here 

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:20.230
 you have to put the coordinates of the 

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:23.620
 orange then it's good to download 

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:25.090
 the map and you can prove it you and 

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:27.010
 can you put this in your world worth 

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:28.330
 I hope you liked guys and not 

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:31.270
 forget to stop by the video of 

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:33.310
 c7 and rocks is worth the kid 

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:35.560
 he said to make a video of this is and 

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:37.660
 so you can see how the heat did 

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:38.800
 did differently than how I did it, it's worth 

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:42.070
 we see in the following video what 

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:43.600
 be ticos is not going to the movies 

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:48.540
 and peace 

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:48.540
 hit like because nothing
