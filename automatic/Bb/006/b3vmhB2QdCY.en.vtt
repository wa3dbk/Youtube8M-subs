warmed<00:01:30.720> then<00:01:31.409> and<00:01:32.340> like<00:01:32.520> I<00:01:32.670> guess<00:01:32.850> the<00:01:33.920> liquid

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
warmed then and like I guess the liquid

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.399 
warmed then and like I guess the liquid
that<00:01:35.310> was<00:01:35.490> inside<00:01:35.790> of<00:01:35.820> it<00:01:36.060> it<00:01:36.810> got<00:01:37.020> um<00:01:37.170> dried

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
that was inside of it it got um dried

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.710 
that was inside of it it got um dried
off<00:01:37.700> but<00:01:38.700> I<00:01:38.729> don't<00:01:39.000> think<00:01:39.119> it<00:01:39.270> was<00:01:39.360> that<00:01:39.420> much

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
off but I don't think it was that much

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.380 
off but I don't think it was that much
though<00:01:40.100> just<00:01:41.100> because<00:01:41.400> weren't<00:01:41.790> working<00:01:42.150> and

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
though just because weren't working and

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.510 
though just because weren't working and
so<00:01:42.990> I<00:01:43.020> left<00:01:43.320> it<00:01:43.470> there<00:01:43.619> for<00:01:43.680> like<00:01:44.009> about<00:01:44.130> 30

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
so I left it there for like about 30

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.050 
so I left it there for like about 30
minutes<00:01:44.880> and<00:01:46.369> after<00:01:47.369> that<00:01:47.640> I<00:01:47.700> was<00:01:47.909> working
