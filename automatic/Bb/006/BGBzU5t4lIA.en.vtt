portrait mode so as you can see it is

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:29.330 
portrait mode so as you can see it is
this<00:00:26.940> magazine<00:00:27.390> reader<00:00:27.750> and<00:00:28.110> when<00:00:29.070> I<00:00:29.160> have<00:00:29.310> it

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
this magazine reader and when I have it

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.279 
this magazine reader and when I have it
imported<00:00:29.970> mode<00:00:30.150> liar<00:00:30.360> right<00:00:30.750> now<00:00:30.960> I<00:00:30.990> have<00:00:31.260> a

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
imported mode liar right now I have a

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.279 
imported mode liar right now I have a
resolution<00:00:31.800> of<00:00:32.070> something<00:00:32.430> like<00:00:32.579> 600<00:00:33.270> x<00:00:33.449> I'm

00:00:34.279 --> 00:00:34.289 
resolution of something like 600 x I'm

00:00:34.289 --> 00:00:37.040 
resolution of something like 600 x I'm
guessing<00:00:34.680> eight<00:00:34.829> or<00:00:35.010> nine<00:00:35.190> hundred<00:00:35.930> it's<00:00:36.930> very

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
guessing eight or nine hundred it's very

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.139 
guessing eight or nine hundred it's very
nice<00:00:37.320> for<00:00:38.010> reading<00:00:38.280> magazines<00:00:38.760> like<00:00:38.970> this

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
nice for reading magazines like this

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:42.229 
nice for reading magazines like this
because<00:00:39.360> it<00:00:39.630> can<00:00:39.750> just<00:00:40.520> flip<00:00:41.520> through<00:00:41.550> and<00:00:41.970> see

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
because it can just flip through and see

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.450 
because it can just flip through and see
at<00:00:42.660> least<00:00:42.930> most<00:00:43.320> of<00:00:43.530> the<00:00:43.680> text<00:00:44.100> without

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
at least most of the text without

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.850 
at least most of the text without
zooming<00:00:44.960> if<00:00:45.960> you<00:00:46.110> want<00:00:46.290> to<00:00:46.410> assume<00:00:46.590> it's

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
zooming if you want to assume it's

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.690 
zooming if you want to assume it's
pretty<00:00:47.160> simple<00:00:47.399> to<00:00:47.640> do<00:00:47.790> so<00:00:49.280> this<00:00:50.280> works<00:00:50.520> great

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
pretty simple to do so this works great

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:55.060 
pretty simple to do so this works great
for<00:00:50.969> reading<00:00:52.579> magazines<00:00:53.579> on<00:00:53.790> the<00:00:53.879> go<00:00:54.059> and

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:55.070 
for reading magazines on the go and

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:58.310 
for reading magazines on the go and
having<00:00:56.070> a<00:00:56.300> resolution<00:00:57.300> like<00:00:57.570> this<00:00:57.629> is<00:00:58.050> really

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
having a resolution like this is really

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.729 
having a resolution like this is really
nice<00:00:58.559> because<00:00:59.180> when<00:01:00.180> you<00:01:00.329> use<00:01:00.780> it<00:01:00.960> in<00:01:01.140> portrait

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
nice because when you use it in portrait

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.110 
nice because when you use it in portrait
mode<00:01:01.770> like<00:01:02.100> this<00:01:02.340> you<00:01:02.489> have<00:01:02.700> a<00:01:02.910> better

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
mode like this you have a better

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.640 
mode like this you have a better
resolution<00:01:03.329> than<00:01:03.870> most<00:01:04.909> computer<00:01:05.909> screens

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:06.650 
resolution than most computer screens

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:10.969 
resolution than most computer screens
when<00:01:07.650> using<00:01:08.070> in<00:01:08.190> landscape<00:01:08.670> mode<00:01:08.700> because<00:01:09.979> a

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
when using in landscape mode because a

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:14.930 
when using in landscape mode because a
vertical<00:01:11.850> resolution<00:01:12.000> on<00:01:12.979> 2010<00:01:13.979> 24<00:01:14.670> is<00:01:14.820> the

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:14.940 
vertical resolution on 2010 24 is the

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:18.969 
vertical resolution on 2010 24 is the
same<00:01:15.180> as<00:01:15.420> you'd<00:01:16.229> get<00:01:16.530> on<00:01:16.799> a<00:01:16.939> 1080p<00:01:17.939> monitor<00:01:18.330> so

00:01:18.969 --> 00:01:18.979 
same as you'd get on a 1080p monitor so

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:23.359 
same as you'd get on a 1080p monitor so
it's<00:01:19.979> realize<00:01:20.520> for<00:01:20.729> reading<00:01:20.970> magazines<00:01:22.369> try

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
it's realize for reading magazines try

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.130 
it's realize for reading magazines try
putting<00:01:23.580> it<00:01:23.820> in<00:01:23.939> full<00:01:24.119> screen<00:01:24.270> mode<00:01:24.420> get<00:01:24.840> a<00:01:24.869> few

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
putting it in full screen mode get a few

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:34.550 
putting it in full screen mode get a few
extra<00:01:25.200> pixels<00:01:29.750> like<00:01:30.750> that<00:01:32.540> and<00:01:33.540> while<00:01:33.720> the<00:01:33.990> CPU

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
extra pixels like that and while the CPU

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.530 
extra pixels like that and while the CPU
isn't<00:01:34.830> exactly<00:01:35.220> fastest<00:01:35.790> on<00:01:35.909> the<00:01:35.939> market<00:01:36.390> it

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
isn't exactly fastest on the market it

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.630 
isn't exactly fastest on the market it
works<00:01:36.840> great<00:01:37.409> for<00:01:37.439> something<00:01:38.040> like<00:01:38.189> this<00:01:38.400> and

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
works great for something like this and

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.190 
works great for something like this and
also<00:01:39.530> PDFs<00:01:40.530> and<00:01:40.830> all<00:01:41.369> that<00:01:41.820> stuff<00:01:42.000> you<00:01:42.180> can<00:01:42.479> it

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
also PDFs and all that stuff you can it

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.950 
also PDFs and all that stuff you can it
works<00:01:43.560> but<00:01:43.890> it's<00:01:44.100> not<00:01:44.369> the<00:01:44.700> fastest<00:01:45.329> PDF<00:01:45.780> is<00:01:45.930> a

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
works but it's not the fastest PDF is a

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.990 
works but it's not the fastest PDF is a
pretty<00:01:46.380> outdated<00:01:46.680> format<00:01:47.400> if<00:01:47.549> you<00:01:47.640> ask<00:01:47.790> me

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
pretty outdated format if you ask me

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.140 
pretty outdated format if you ask me
it's<00:01:48.570> way<00:01:48.869> to<00:01:48.930> CPU<00:01:49.619> intensive<00:01:49.770> for<00:01:50.369> our<00:01:50.490> for

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:51.150 
it's way to CPU intensive for our for

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:52.940 
it's way to CPU intensive for our for
what<00:01:51.299> it<00:01:51.420> does<00:01:51.659> and<00:01:51.930> it<00:01:52.200> doesn't<00:01:52.259> work<00:01:52.710> well

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
what it does and it doesn't work well

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:57.920 
what it does and it doesn't work well
with<00:01:53.240> devices<00:01:54.240> like<00:01:54.450> this<00:01:55.909> which<00:01:56.930> bid

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
with devices like this which bid

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.569 
with devices like this which bid
netbooks<00:01:58.409> and<00:01:58.530> everything<00:01:58.979> and<00:01:59.250> they're

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
netbooks and everything and they're

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:02.780 
netbooks and everything and they're
becoming<00:02:00.000> more<00:02:00.149> and<00:02:00.450> more<00:02:00.600> common<00:02:00.840> so<00:02:01.790> we

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
becoming more and more common so we

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.520 
becoming more and more common so we
should<00:02:02.970> really<00:02:03.299> look<00:02:03.420> into<00:02:03.600> a<00:02:03.810> format<00:02:04.470> that

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
should really look into a format that

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.990 
should really look into a format that
replaces<00:02:05.460> that<00:02:06.860> PDFs<00:02:07.860> and<00:02:08.159> flash<00:02:08.759> and

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
replaces that PDFs and flash and

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.739 
replaces that PDFs and flash and
everything<00:02:09.329> like<00:02:09.509> that<00:02:09.569> and<00:02:11.480> this<00:02:12.480> is<00:02:12.659> the

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:12.749 
everything like that and this is the

00:02:12.749 --> 00:02:14.730 
everything like that and this is the
on-screen<00:02:12.989> keyboard<00:02:13.559> as<00:02:13.680> you<00:02:13.769> can<00:02:13.919> see

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:14.740 
on-screen keyboard as you can see

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:17.850 
on-screen keyboard as you can see
bring<00:02:15.010> it<00:02:15.130> up<00:02:15.190> and<00:02:15.990> the<00:02:16.990> shortcut<00:02:17.380> button<00:02:17.650> here

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:17.860 
bring it up and the shortcut button here

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:22.430 
bring it up and the shortcut button here
and<00:02:18.010> I<00:02:18.340> can<00:02:18.850> also<00:02:19.000> use<00:02:19.300> the<00:02:20.820> windows<00:02:21.820> seven

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
and I can also use the windows seven

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:25.980 
and I can also use the windows seven
on-screen<00:02:23.440> keyboard<00:02:23.980> I<00:02:24.240> prefer<00:02:25.240> using<00:02:25.630> this

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:25.990 
on-screen keyboard I prefer using this

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:29.100 
on-screen keyboard I prefer using this
if<00:02:26.200> I<00:02:26.290> use<00:02:26.500> the<00:02:26.650> Styles<00:02:27.040> lot<00:02:27.280> but<00:02:27.690> it's<00:02:28.690> easier

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:29.110 
if I use the Styles lot but it's easier

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:31.650 
if I use the Styles lot but it's easier
to<00:02:29.290> bring<00:02:29.500> up<00:02:29.710> the<00:02:30.700> middle<00:02:30.880> of<00:02:31.030> keyboard<00:02:31.510> if

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:31.660 
to bring up the middle of keyboard if

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:33.330 
to bring up the middle of keyboard if
you're<00:02:31.870> in<00:02:32.080> full<00:02:32.380> screen<00:02:32.680> or<00:02:32.980> anything<00:02:33.310> like

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:33.340 
you're in full screen or anything like

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:36.480 
you're in full screen or anything like
that<00:02:33.490> because<00:02:33.850> you<00:02:34.780> don't<00:02:34.960> have<00:02:35.110> to<00:02:35.320> get<00:02:36.280> down

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:36.490 
that because you don't have to get down

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:39.570 
that because you don't have to get down
to<00:02:36.640> the<00:02:36.670> task<00:02:37.030> bar<00:02:37.270> to<00:02:37.540> access<00:02:37.660> it<00:02:38.020> so<00:02:38.580> and

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:39.580 
to the task bar to access it so and

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:41.490 
to the task bar to access it so and
basically<00:02:40.000> that's<00:02:40.240> it<00:02:40.480> for<00:02:40.750> Abby<00:02:40.990> levis<00:02:41.290> file

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:41.500 
basically that's it for Abby levis file

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:43.320 
basically that's it for Abby levis file
of<00:02:41.740> course<00:02:42.130> you<00:02:42.250> can<00:02:42.370> run<00:02:42.610> basically<00:02:43.090> any

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:43.330 
of course you can run basically any

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:45.630 
of course you can run basically any
application<00:02:43.960> you<00:02:44.080> want<00:02:44.200> on<00:02:44.470> this<00:02:44.590> thing<00:02:44.980> I'm

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:45.640 
application you want on this thing I'm

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:49.140 
application you want on this thing I'm
also<00:02:45.850> running<00:02:46.090> Photoshop<00:02:46.570> 7<00:02:47.410> on<00:02:47.530> it<00:02:47.970> it's<00:02:48.970> not

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.150 
also running Photoshop 7 on it it's not

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:52.620 
also running Photoshop 7 on it it's not
exactly<00:02:49.330> the<00:02:49.870> fastest<00:02:50.380> but<00:02:50.620> it<00:02:51.310> works<00:02:51.640> so<00:02:52.510> of

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:52.630 
exactly the fastest but it works so of

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:56.400 
exactly the fastest but it works so of
course<00:02:52.690> that's<00:02:53.650> the<00:02:54.420> upside<00:02:55.420> of<00:02:55.720> having<00:02:55.870> a

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:56.410 
course that's the upside of having a

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:59.070 
course that's the upside of having a
full<00:02:57.160> computer<00:02:57.550> as<00:02:57.820> a<00:02:57.970> PMP<00:02:58.330> because<00:02:58.840> it's

00:02:59.070 --> 00:02:59.080 
full computer as a PMP because it's

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:01.650 
full computer as a PMP because it's
completely<00:03:00.000> independent<00:03:01.000> you<00:03:01.210> don't<00:03:01.420> need<00:03:01.630> a

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:01.660 
completely independent you don't need a

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:04.680 
completely independent you don't need a
host<00:03:01.870> computer<00:03:02.050> you<00:03:02.560> can<00:03:03.090> you<00:03:04.090> can<00:03:04.270> use<00:03:04.420> any

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:04.690 
host computer you can you can use any

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:07.680 
host computer you can you can use any
music<00:03:05.380> service<00:03:05.950> any<00:03:06.220> video<00:03:06.910> service<00:03:07.330> at<00:03:07.480> least

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:07.690 
music service any video service at least

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:10.110 
music service any video service at least
for<00:03:08.290> downloading<00:03:09.010> and<00:03:09.250> you<00:03:09.610> can't<00:03:09.820> exactly

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:10.120 
for downloading and you can't exactly

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:11.790 
for downloading and you can't exactly
stream<00:03:10.630> all<00:03:10.870> that<00:03:11.020> much<00:03:11.200> on<00:03:11.350> this<00:03:11.500> thing

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:11.800 
stream all that much on this thing

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:15.510 
stream all that much on this thing
because<00:03:12.730> of<00:03:12.880> the<00:03:13.030> CPU<00:03:13.480> but<00:03:14.380> um<00:03:14.620> it's

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:15.520 
because of the CPU but um it's

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:16.950 
because of the CPU but um it's
completely<00:03:16.030> independent<00:03:16.570> from<00:03:16.600> host

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:16.960 
completely independent from host

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:19.440 
completely independent from host
computer<00:03:17.560> so<00:03:17.890> you<00:03:18.250> can<00:03:18.430> use<00:03:18.850> this<00:03:19.060> and<00:03:19.270> never

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:19.450 
computer so you can use this and never

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:21.840 
computer so you can use this and never
have<00:03:19.630> to<00:03:19.660> connect<00:03:20.320> to<00:03:20.530> a<00:03:20.560> host<00:03:21.100> computer<00:03:21.250> to

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:21.850 
have to connect to a host computer to

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:24.360 
have to connect to a host computer to
access<00:03:22.030> your<00:03:22.360> music<00:03:22.900> or<00:03:23.050> anything<00:03:23.130> which<00:03:24.130> is

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:24.370 
access your music or anything which is

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:27.300 
access your music or anything which is
what<00:03:24.700> sets<00:03:25.180> this<00:03:25.420> apart<00:03:25.480> from<00:03:26.140> something<00:03:27.070> like

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:27.310 
what sets this apart from something like

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:31.110 
what sets this apart from something like
the<00:03:28.060> articles<00:03:28.450> 5<00:03:28.630> or<00:03:29.340> the<00:03:30.340> ipad<00:03:30.790> for<00:03:31.000> that

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:31.120 
the articles 5 or the ipad for that

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:33.330 
the articles 5 or the ipad for that
matter<00:03:31.330> if<00:03:32.140> you<00:03:32.290> have<00:03:32.410> an<00:03:32.530> iPad<00:03:32.800> you're<00:03:33.010> going

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:33.340 
matter if you have an iPad you're going

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:35.730 
matter if you have an iPad you're going
to<00:03:33.490> have<00:03:33.610> to<00:03:33.730> connect<00:03:34.030> it<00:03:34.210> to<00:03:35.050> something<00:03:35.080> to

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:35.740 
to have to connect it to something to

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:37.500 
to have to connect it to something to
get<00:03:35.890> content<00:03:36.550> on<00:03:36.640> it<00:03:36.790> even<00:03:36.940> though<00:03:37.120> you<00:03:37.270> can

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:37.510 
get content on it even though you can

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:41.220 
get content on it even though you can
access<00:03:38.220> some<00:03:39.220> of<00:03:39.250> it<00:03:39.520> on<00:03:39.760> the<00:03:39.850> go<00:03:40.030> so<00:03:40.330> and<00:03:41.050> also

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:41.230 
access some of it on the go so and also

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:43.080 
access some of it on the go so and also
of<00:03:41.440> course<00:03:41.620> since<00:03:42.040> this<00:03:42.100> runs<00:03:42.490> Windows<00:03:42.910> you

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:43.090 
of course since this runs Windows you

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:44.910 
of course since this runs Windows you
have<00:03:43.270> flash<00:03:43.960> support<00:03:44.410> and<00:03:44.650> you<00:03:44.710> have

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:44.920 
have flash support and you have

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:47.850 
have flash support and you have
JavaScript<00:03:45.910> support<00:03:46.300> and<00:03:47.170> everything<00:03:47.710> like

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:47.860 
JavaScript support and everything like

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:51.000 
JavaScript support and everything like
that<00:03:47.920> so<00:03:48.930> compared<00:03:49.930> to<00:03:49.990> the<00:03:50.200> ipad<00:03:50.380> i<00:03:50.650> think

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:51.010 
that so compared to the ipad i think

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:53.310 
that so compared to the ipad i think
this<00:03:51.160> is<00:03:51.220> a<00:03:51.520> better<00:03:51.940> alternative<00:03:52.120> if<00:03:52.990> you<00:03:53.110> want

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:53.320 
this is a better alternative if you want

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:55.410 
this is a better alternative if you want
a<00:03:53.470> Productivity<00:03:54.340> device<00:03:54.610> as<00:03:54.850> well<00:03:55.060> as<00:03:55.240> a

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:55.420 
a Productivity device as well as a

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:57.450 
a Productivity device as well as a
independent<00:03:56.020> device<00:03:56.740> that<00:03:56.980> you<00:03:57.100> don't<00:03:57.280> have

00:03:57.450 --> 00:03:57.460 
independent device that you don't have

00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:03.180 
independent device that you don't have
to<00:03:57.670> use<00:03:58.150> veet<00:03:59.140> a<00:03:59.320> computer<00:03:59.890> um<00:04:01.650> you<00:04:02.650> can<00:04:02.800> throw

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:03.190 
to use veet a computer um you can throw

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:05.250 
to use veet a computer um you can throw
in<00:04:03.370> a<00:04:03.490> keyboard<00:04:04.120> and<00:04:04.270> a<00:04:04.360> mouse<00:04:04.390> in<00:04:04.630> a<00:04:04.990> bag<00:04:05.230> and

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:05.260 
in a keyboard and a mouse in a bag and

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:08.010 
in a keyboard and a mouse in a bag and
bring<00:04:05.920> this<00:04:06.190> video<00:04:06.730> on<00:04:06.970> my<00:04:07.180> business<00:04:07.390> trip<00:04:07.810> and

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:08.020 
bring this video on my business trip and

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:10.050 
bring this video on my business trip and
basically<00:04:08.620> be<00:04:08.860> set<00:04:09.160> because<00:04:09.400> it<00:04:09.700> can<00:04:09.910> do

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:10.060 
basically be set because it can do

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:12.300 
basically be set because it can do
anything<00:04:10.390> that<00:04:10.600> I<00:04:10.780> netbook<00:04:11.320> or<00:04:11.530> a<00:04:11.590> laptop<00:04:11.890> can

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:12.310 
anything that I netbook or a laptop can

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:16.440 
anything that I netbook or a laptop can
do<00:04:12.459> just<00:04:12.850> not<00:04:13.840> as<00:04:14.020> fast<00:04:14.290> so<00:04:15.120> for<00:04:16.120> six<00:04:16.330> hundred

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:16.450 
do just not as fast so for six hundred

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:18.000 
do just not as fast so for six hundred
dollars<00:04:16.660> i<00:04:17.109> think<00:04:17.350> this<00:04:17.470> is<00:04:17.650> a<00:04:17.680> very<00:04:17.770> good

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:18.010 
dollars i think this is a very good

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:20.070 
dollars i think this is a very good
device<00:04:18.430> both<00:04:18.730> for<00:04:19.030> media<00:04:19.450> and<00:04:19.720> for

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:20.080 
device both for media and for

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:23.370 
device both for media and for
productivity<00:04:20.980> or<00:04:21.310> work<00:04:22.180> or<00:04:22.600> school<00:04:23.169> or

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:23.380 
productivity or work or school or

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:26.770 
productivity or work or school or
whatever<00:04:23.770> you<00:04:24.130> want<00:04:24.310> to<00:04:24.400> do<00:04:24.520> with<00:04:24.669> it<00:04:24.900> so
