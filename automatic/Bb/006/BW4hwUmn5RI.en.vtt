00:01:13.469 --> 00:01:13.479 
families of all ages it's just a really

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:18.640 
just a huge sigh of relief for a lot of

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:20.790 
just a huge sigh of relief for a lot of
families<00:01:19.030> probably<00:01:19.450> a<00:01:19.509> day<00:01:20.020> that<00:01:20.290> everybody's

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:20.800 
families probably a day that everybody's

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:22.310 
families probably a day that everybody's
been<00:01:20.979> waiting<00:01:21.130> for<00:01:21.520> for<00:01:21.700> a<00:01:21.759> really<00:01:22.000> long<00:01:22.030> time

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
been waiting for for a really long time

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.680 
been waiting for for a really long time
every<00:01:23.320> child<00:01:23.770> I've<00:01:24.070> adopted<00:01:24.340> where<00:01:25.300> they<00:01:25.479> came

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:25.690 
every child I've adopted where they came

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:27.749 
every child I've adopted where they came
from<00:01:25.750> in<00:01:26.170> the<00:01:26.259> path<00:01:26.500> to<00:01:26.830> get<00:01:26.979> them<00:01:27.130> to<00:01:27.310> adoption

00:01:27.749 --> 00:01:27.759 
from in the path to get them to adoption

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:31.170 
from in the path to get them to adoption
day<00:01:27.940> has<00:01:28.630> been<00:01:28.869> very<00:01:29.229> different<00:01:29.560> so<00:01:30.340> the

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:31.180 
day has been very different so the

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:33.180 
day has been very different so the
culmination<00:01:31.690> of<00:01:32.020> signing<00:01:32.920> on<00:01:33.039> the<00:01:33.070> dotted

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:33.190 
culmination of signing on the dotted

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:35.850 
culmination of signing on the dotted
line<00:01:33.490> and<00:01:33.729> knowing<00:01:34.420> that<00:01:34.600> they're<00:01:35.530> part<00:01:35.800> of

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:35.860 
line and knowing that they're part of

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:38.760 
line and knowing that they're part of
our<00:01:35.950> forever<00:01:36.399> family<00:01:36.850> is<00:01:37.000> a<00:01:37.030> huge<00:01:37.149> a<00:01:37.899> huge<00:01:38.259> deal

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:38.770 
our forever family is a huge a huge deal

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:41.850 
our forever family is a huge a huge deal
so<00:01:39.220> it's<00:01:40.060> probably<00:01:40.509> just<00:01:40.780> the<00:01:40.899> path<00:01:41.170> to<00:01:41.560> get<00:01:41.740> us

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:41.860 
so it's probably just the path to get us

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:45.749 
so it's probably just the path to get us
there<00:01:42.160> and<00:01:43.619> every<00:01:44.619> child<00:01:44.920> is<00:01:45.160> unique<00:01:45.190> every

00:01:45.749 --> 00:01:45.759 
there and every child is unique every

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:48.540 
there and every child is unique every
child<00:01:45.970> situation<00:01:46.690> is<00:01:46.810> different<00:01:47.229> my<00:01:48.070> only

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:48.550 
child situation is different my only

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:51.450 
child situation is different my only
biological<00:01:49.479> child<00:01:49.509> I<00:01:49.990> didn't<00:01:50.890> want<00:01:51.070> him<00:01:51.250> to<00:01:51.280> be

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:51.460 
biological child I didn't want him to be

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:53.639 
biological child I didn't want him to be
an<00:01:51.550> only<00:01:51.789> child<00:01:52.060> I<00:01:52.570> don't<00:01:53.170> think<00:01:53.500> he<00:01:53.619> ever

00:01:53.639 --> 00:01:53.649 
an only child I don't think he ever

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:56.730 
an only child I don't think he ever
really<00:01:53.830> remembers<00:01:54.550> not<00:01:55.210> having<00:01:55.810> a<00:01:56.080> bunch<00:01:56.590> of
