watched some of my videos you'll see
that<00:01:20.369> I<00:01:20.430> use<00:01:20.610> this<00:01:20.790> and<00:01:20.970> say<00:01:21.150> four<00:01:21.390> is<00:01:21.450> quite<00:01:21.720> a

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
that I use this and say four is quite a

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.830 
that I use this and say four is quite a
lot<00:01:22.020> I<00:01:22.549> would<00:01:23.549> actually<00:01:23.820> say<00:01:24.210> that<00:01:24.390> the<00:01:24.479> sensor

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
lot I would actually say that the sensor

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.260 
lot I would actually say that the sensor
is<00:01:24.869> pitched<00:01:25.170> by<00:01:25.439> a<00:01:25.470> little<00:01:25.770> bit<00:01:25.920> but<00:01:26.270> mostly

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
is pitched by a little bit but mostly

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:28.969 
is pitched by a little bit but mostly
you<00:01:27.509> can't<00:01:27.750> tell<00:01:27.930> the<00:01:28.049> difference<00:01:28.080> we've<00:01:28.650> been

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
you can't tell the difference we've been

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.940 
you can't tell the difference we've been
really<00:01:29.490> really<00:01:29.640> similar<00:01:30.090> and<00:01:30.930> this<00:01:31.110> is<00:01:31.290> not

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
really really similar and this is not

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.800 
really really similar and this is not
too<00:01:32.100> expensive<00:01:32.220> this<00:01:32.729> cost<00:01:33.060> me<00:01:33.299> I<00:01:33.450> think<00:01:33.630> about

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
too expensive this cost me I think about

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.859 
too expensive this cost me I think about
pound<00:01:34.170> for<00:01:35.070> a<00:01:35.460> hundred<00:01:35.880> grams<00:01:36.060> which<00:01:36.479> is<00:01:36.780> about

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
pound for a hundred grams which is about

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:40.709 
pound for a hundred grams which is about
coke<00:01:37.320> market<00:01:37.799> rent<00:01:38.009> in

00:01:40.709 --> 00:01:40.719 

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:44.700 

now<00:01:41.649> this<00:01:41.890> is<00:01:42.880> a<00:01:42.939> baking<00:01:43.420> chocolate<00:01:43.899> it's

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:44.710 
now this is a baking chocolate it's

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:46.010 
now this is a baking chocolate it's
slightly<00:01:45.100> different

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
slightly different

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.660 
slightly different
I'm<00:01:47.020> personally<00:01:47.649> so<00:01:48.069> from<00:01:48.249> my<00:01:48.310> personal

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:29.390 
can if I was really in a push then I

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:31.750 
can if I was really in a push then I
would<00:03:29.540> possibly<00:03:29.810> use<00:03:30.380> this<00:03:30.590> or<00:03:31.070> cake<00:03:31.400> pops

would possibly use this or cake pops

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:34.000 
would possibly use this or cake pops
just<00:03:32.150> to<00:03:32.240> cover<00:03:32.420> the<00:03:32.540> outside<00:03:32.960> but<00:03:33.740> I<00:03:33.800> just

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:34.010 
just to cover the outside but I just

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:37.780 
just to cover the outside but I just
don't<00:03:34.100> think<00:03:34.220> it's<00:03:34.430> very<00:03:34.460> tasty<00:03:34.970> but<00:03:36.640> when<00:03:37.640> we

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:37.790 
don't think it's very tasty but when we

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:40.390 
don't think it's very tasty but when we
consider<00:03:38.270> it<00:03:38.390> to<00:03:38.570> the<00:03:38.690> baking<00:03:39.170> chocolate<00:03:39.680> this

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:40.400 
consider it to the baking chocolate this

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:43.150 
consider it to the baking chocolate this
is<00:03:40.730> a<00:03:40.790> hundred<00:03:41.150> grams<00:03:41.750> this<00:03:42.140> is<00:03:42.440> 300<00:03:43.040> pounds

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:43.160 
is a hundred grams this is 300 pounds

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:47.350 
is a hundred grams this is 300 pounds
and<00:03:43.400> this<00:03:43.610> was<00:03:43.820> still<00:03:44.090> cheaper<00:03:46.360> actually

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:47.360 
and this was still cheaper actually

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:48.670 
and this was still cheaper actually
cheaper<00:03:47.720> even<00:03:47.990> though<00:03:48.050> it's<00:03:48.140> twice<00:03:48.350> the<00:03:48.380> size

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:48.680 
cheaper even though it's twice the size

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:54.420 
cheaper even though it's twice the size
the<00:03:49.340> next<00:03:49.490> set<00:03:49.960> in<00:03:50.960> order<00:03:51.400> this<00:03:52.400> I<00:03:52.760> would<00:03:53.150> use

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:54.430 
the next set in order this I would use

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:58.240 
the next set in order this I would use
this<00:03:55.430> I<00:03:55.670> would<00:03:55.820> possibly<00:03:56.420> use<00:03:56.990> this<00:03:57.920> I<00:03:58.130> will

00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:58.250 
this I would possibly use this I will

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:03.880 
this I would possibly use this I will
probably<00:03:58.520> never<00:03:59.000> happen<00:04:02.470> now<00:04:03.470> moving<00:04:03.710> on

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:35.120 
infinitely better like I literally can't

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:36.220 
infinitely better like I literally can't
even<00:04:35.330> tell<00:04:35.480> you<00:04:35.510> they're<00:04:35.720> not<00:04:35.750> even<00:04:36.110> in<00:04:36.200> the

even tell you they're not even in the
same<00:04:36.470> league<00:04:36.710> so<00:04:37.130> if<00:04:37.550> you<00:04:37.790> can<00:04:37.970> afford<00:04:38.090> it

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:38.510 
same league so if you can afford it

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:40.510 
same league so if you can afford it
spend<00:04:39.440> the<00:04:39.560> extra<00:04:39.680> money<00:04:39.890> on<00:04:40.190> this

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:40.520 
spend the extra money on this

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:42.250 
spend the extra money on this
I'll<00:04:40.610> admit<00:04:40.970> that<00:04:41.150> it<00:04:41.390> probably<00:04:41.840> is<00:04:41.900> going<00:04:41.990> to

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:42.260 
I'll admit that it probably is going to

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:45.190 
I'll admit that it probably is going to
