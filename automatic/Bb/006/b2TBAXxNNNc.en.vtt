aks pen gate aki think this is really
really<00:00:08.220> ridiculous<00:00:08.970> and<00:00:09.330> i<00:00:09.510> don't<00:00:09.900> know<00:00:10.080> why

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:10.230

really ridiculous and i don't know why
this<00:00:10.290> is<00:00:10.559> a<00:00:10.650> thing<00:00:10.860> but<00:00:11.190> i<00:00:11.460> guess<00:00:12.150> we<00:00:12.300> can't

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
this is a thing but i guess we can't

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:13.999 
this is a thing but i guess we can't
have<00:00:12.599> a<00:00:12.630> phone<00:00:12.929> these<00:00:13.320> days<00:00:13.349> without<00:00:13.740> some

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009

have a phone these days without some
type<00:00:14.040> of<00:00:14.250> gate<00:00:14.670> or<00:00:14.910> some<00:00:15.299> type<00:00:15.450> of<00:00:15.480> scandal<00:00:16.049> i

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
type of gate or some type of scandal i

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.080 
type of gate or some type of scandal i
guess<00:00:16.379> associated<00:00:17.130> with<00:00:17.250> it<00:00:17.400> but<00:00:17.580> basically

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
what s pen Gator pen gate is all about

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.120 
what s pen Gator pen gate is all about
is<00:00:20.939> it<00:00:20.970> you<00:00:21.210> slide<00:00:21.480> out<00:00:21.689> your<00:00:22.260> S<00:00:22.650> Pen<00:00:22.710> any

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
galaxy note5 you start to use it do your

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.050 
galaxy note5 you start to use it do your
thing<00:00:25.439> and<00:00:25.650> why<00:00:25.800> not<00:00:26.070> all<00:00:26.310> your<00:00:26.460> writing<00:00:26.820> get

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
miraculous way you all of a sudden

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.590 
miraculous way you all of a sudden
forget<00:00:31.050> which<00:00:31.260> end<00:00:31.560> it<00:00:31.830> goes<00:00:32.009> in<00:00:32.279> and<00:00:32.640> you<00:00:33.239> slip

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
forget which end it goes in and you slip

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.900 
forget which end it goes in and you slip
it<00:00:33.750> in<00:00:33.870> this<00:00:34.050> way<00:00:34.350> in<00:00:34.680> the<00:00:35.219> wrong<00:00:35.460> way<00:00:35.670> without

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
it in this way in the wrong way without

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.549 
it in this way in the wrong way without
the<00:00:36.030> tip<00:00:36.300> going<00:00:36.540> at<00:00:36.630> first<00:00:36.899> and<00:00:37.140> if<00:00:37.230> you<00:00:37.320> push

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
the tip going at first and if you push

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.250 
the tip going at first and if you push
it<00:00:37.739> in<00:00:37.829> too<00:00:37.980> far<00:00:38.370> you<00:00:39.030> get<00:00:39.210> it<00:00:39.329> stuck<00:00:39.660> and<00:00:40.020> you

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
it in too far you get it stuck and you

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.560 
it in too far you get it stuck and you
can<00:00:40.410> end<00:00:40.530> up<00:00:40.590> breaking<00:00:40.920> the<00:00:41.879> mechanism<00:00:42.420> inside

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
can end up breaking the mechanism inside

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.569 
can end up breaking the mechanism inside
it<00:00:42.870> so<00:00:43.020> no<00:00:43.200> longer<00:00:43.500> recognizes<00:00:43.950> when<00:00:44.399> you

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
it so no longer recognizes when you

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.630 
it so no longer recognizes when you
slide<00:00:44.850> out<00:00:45.030> the<00:00:45.059> S<00:00:45.329> Pen<00:00:45.950> my<00:00:46.950> only<00:00:47.070> problem<00:00:47.370> with

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
slide out the S Pen my only problem with

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.750 
slide out the S Pen my only problem with
this<00:00:47.760> is<00:00:48.059> how<00:00:48.780> would<00:00:49.020> anyone<00:00:49.469> do<00:00:50.129> this<00:00:50.160> and<00:00:50.700> not

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
this is how would anyone do this and not

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.189 
this is how would anyone do this and not
be<00:00:51.090> able<00:00:51.149> to<00:00:51.300> pay<00:00:51.390> attention<00:00:51.840> even<00:00:52.050> if<00:00:52.110> I

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
be able to pay attention even if I

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.380 
be able to pay attention even if I
dropped<00:00:52.620> it<00:00:52.860> or<00:00:53.160> move<00:00:53.370> it<00:00:53.610> around<00:00:53.730> I<00:00:54.120> paying

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
dropped it or move it around I paying

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.020 
dropped it or move it around I paying
attention<00:00:54.930> i<00:00:55.020> would<00:00:55.170> at<00:00:55.260> least<00:00:55.410> feel<00:00:56.280> some<00:00:56.850> way

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
attention i would at least feel some way

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.119 
attention i would at least feel some way
around<00:00:57.180> and<00:00:57.660> i<00:00:57.690> wouldn't<00:00:57.870> just<00:00:58.050> jam<00:00:58.530> the<00:00:58.890> pen

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
around and i wouldn't just jam the pen

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.119 
around and i wouldn't just jam the pen
right<00:00:59.309> back<00:00:59.520> in<00:00:59.760> is<00:00:59.910> something<00:01:00.210> i<00:01:00.270> clearly

00:01:01.119 --> 00:01:01.129 
right back in is something i clearly

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:03.619 
right back in is something i clearly
would<00:01:02.129> pay<00:01:02.370> attention<00:01:02.910> to<00:01:03.059> I<00:01:03.090> really<00:01:03.480> don't

understand anyone else could not pay
attention<00:01:05.369> to<00:01:05.729> this<00:01:05.880> I<00:01:06.060> mean<00:01:06.510> granted<00:01:06.900> this

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.190 
I mean in 05 then from the note 40 you
can<00:01:11.310> bring<00:01:11.430> the<00:01:11.549> note<00:01:11.700> 4<00:01:11.909> over<00:01:12.180> here<00:01:12.360> S<00:01:12.900> Pen

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
can bring the note 4 over here S Pen

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
can sort of slide it in still a little

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.990 
can sort of slide it in still a little
bit<00:01:19.290> you<00:01:19.950> know<00:01:19.979> it's<00:01:20.400> still<00:01:20.549> a<00:01:20.610> little<00:01:20.729> bit<00:01:20.909> of

bit you know it's still a little bit of

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.480 
bit you know it's still a little bit of
a<00:01:21.030> mechanism<00:01:21.600> sort<00:01:21.840> of<00:01:21.900> block<00:01:22.140> it<00:01:22.350> in<00:01:22.500> there<00:01:22.770> go

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
a mechanism sort of block it in there go

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:24.710 
a mechanism sort of block it in there go
on<00:01:23.610> the<00:01:23.700> whole<00:01:23.820> way<00:01:23.939> you<00:01:24.000> can<00:01:24.270> still<00:01:24.479> kind<00:01:24.600> of

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
on the whole way you can still kind of

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:25.999 
on the whole way you can still kind of
do<00:01:24.869> it<00:01:25.020> so<00:01:25.140> them<00:01:25.290> because<00:01:25.530> kind<00:01:25.770> of<00:01:25.860> a

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
do it so them because kind of a

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.100 
do it so them because kind of a
launching<00:01:26.490> mechanism<00:01:26.580> at<00:01:27.270> the<00:01:27.780> beginning

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
launching mechanism at the beginning

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.179 
launching mechanism at the beginning
here<00:01:28.470> and<00:01:28.729> such<00:01:29.729> but<00:01:30.030> still<00:01:30.659> like<00:01:31.140> you<00:01:32.040> would

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
here and such but still like you would

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.280 
here and such but still like you would
have<00:01:32.220> to<00:01:32.460> go<00:01:32.610> through<00:01:32.640> great<00:01:33.509> lengths<00:01:34.170> of

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
have to go through great lengths of

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.740 
have to go through great lengths of
foolishness<00:01:34.860> or<00:01:35.250> completely<00:01:35.790> be<00:01:36.060> not<00:01:36.420> paying

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
foolishness or completely be not paying

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.719 
foolishness or completely be not paying
attention<00:01:36.930> to<00:01:37.740> slide<00:01:37.979> this<00:01:38.130> in<00:01:38.310> it's<00:01:38.490> not<00:01:38.610> like

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
attention to slide this in it's not like
