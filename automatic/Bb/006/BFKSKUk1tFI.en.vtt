00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:07.529
 hello youtube people from example 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:10.110
 I want and welcome some gameplay from 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:11.519
 grand theft auto 5 of playstation3 and the 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:13.680
 daily brings you a video all face 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:15.930
 because I will be announcing when 

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:18.539
 is going to be the new open lobby this time in 

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:20.099
 this gta 5 game we decided to do it 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:21.869
 in a court because a lot of people asked me 

00:00:20.099 --> 00:00:23.489
 to do it in this game and the truth 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:24.989
 that I want to change too and 

00:00:23.489 --> 00:00:26.400
 make other lobbies also in others 

00:00:24.989 --> 00:00:28.319
 games that are not simply code 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.569
 surely the next hair will stay 

00:00:28.319 --> 00:00:32.700
 later on surely in August 

00:00:30.569 --> 00:00:34.289
 It will surely be precisely in 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.269
 a kot but let's take advantage of 

00:00:34.289 --> 00:00:38.940
 opportunity to try new things and 

00:00:36.269 --> 00:00:40.109
 especially to see how gta 5 does not go 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.519
 true that the amount of people that 

00:00:40.109 --> 00:00:44.190
 go into the gta lobbies I think they are 

00:00:41.519 --> 00:00:45.300
 15 16 people more or less so no 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.160
 there is a problem when playing 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.539
 obviously I remind you that what 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.859
 have to do is add the account 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:51.690
 the description of this video appears 

00:00:49.859 --> 00:00:53.339
 I think I'm going to do with the account 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.670
 ernesto and a low ernesto or any 

00:00:53.339 --> 00:00:56.039
 thing 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.480
 check the description of this video and 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:59.129
 the first one I will be announcing that 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.050
 say now that you are leaving are being 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.710
 I saw this opel with you 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.850
 subscribers 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.739
 obviously there are people who want 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.750
 participate but first I wanted to tell you 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.610
 another little thing remember the video of 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.560
 Sunday that I went up with regard to what 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.810
 the sony contest for a trip of three 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.520
 In case you have seen it please 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.440
 I will not leave a note in this 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.970
 video and I'm also surely going to leave 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:19.650
 the previous video regarding what 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.870
 I did a tutorial to get the 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:24.360
 warfare advance camouflage both of 

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:25.680
 whites 2 as the collective but I wanted 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.620
 remind them about this video 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.870
 that already this week I think that Monday was 

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:33.180
 All winners will be announced or 

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:35.450
 the finalists and the big winner of the 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.620
 contest for the trip to e3 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:39.479
 unfortunately for me it was not me 

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:41.340
 winner but I also want to congratulate 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:42.780
 the boy that we won, I think it's called 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.910
 ernesto was just a coincidence 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.710
 everything mentions that karma you have karma 

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:48.270
 of ernesto if the truth is that a 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.580
 ernesto won me but also 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.530
 surely something will have done 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:53.610
 merit itself and also many 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.170
 congratulations to all who 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.790
 other people participated me 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.500
 they commented that it seems that alfredito won 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:00.390
 I think I saw the list there is your name 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.950
 so also congratulations and a 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.750
 special greeting for alfredito also 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:06.360
 that appears on the list of winners 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:08.009

 I appreciate every message of support that 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.420

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:16.890
 a defeat the opposite 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:18.630

 account and for me that is a tool 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:03.299
 fundamental the interaction between youtube 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:05.640

 that at night they can not play then 

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:34.720
 I think this schedule is quite 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:36.159
 appropriate for them to join them 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:38.019
