00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.529 
I'm gonna drop everything now my little
LED<00:02:07.770> light<00:02:07.800> you<00:02:08.610> can<00:02:08.789> see<00:02:09.000> where<00:02:09.179> these<00:02:09.300> two

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
LED light you can see where these two

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.029 
LED light you can see where these two
prongs<00:02:09.869> are<00:02:10.200> are<00:02:10.560> these<00:02:10.709> two<00:02:10.860> little

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
prongs are are these two little

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.220 
prongs are are these two little
connector<00:02:11.340> tips<00:02:11.750> they<00:02:12.750> were<00:02:12.870> actually

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
connector tips they were actually

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:17.690 
connector tips they were actually
straight<00:02:13.709> I<00:02:14.040> was<00:02:15.000> able<00:02:15.209> to<00:02:15.540> bend<00:02:15.840> them<00:02:16.110> to<00:02:16.700> get

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
straight I was able to bend them to get

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:18.979 
straight I was able to bend them to get
them<00:02:17.819> at<00:02:17.940> that<00:02:18.090> angle<00:02:18.450> so<00:02:18.480> they<00:02:18.750> could<00:02:18.870> go

00:02:18.979 --> 00:02:18.989 
them at that angle so they could go

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:20.660 
them at that angle so they could go
underneath<00:02:19.290> the<00:02:19.530> lantern<00:02:19.950> and<00:02:20.220> connect<00:02:20.550> to

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
underneath the lantern and connect to

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:23.089 
underneath the lantern and connect to
the<00:02:20.790> battery<00:02:21.349> so<00:02:22.349> you<00:02:22.440> should<00:02:22.650> be<00:02:22.739> able<00:02:22.800> to<00:02:22.920> do

00:02:23.089 --> 00:02:23.099 
the battery so you should be able to do

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:25.790 
the battery so you should be able to do
that<00:02:23.250> with<00:02:23.400> your<00:02:23.580> LED<00:02:24.440> connector<00:02:25.440> tips<00:02:25.650> as

that<00:02:31.320> on<00:02:31.530> I'm<00:02:31.830> just<00:02:32.070> starting<00:02:32.430> out<00:02:32.550> so<00:02:32.850> I<00:02:33.090> don't

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:33.600 
that on I'm just starting out so I don't

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:34.580 
that on I'm just starting out so I don't
really<00:02:33.690> know<00:02:33.930> what<00:02:34.110> the<00:02:34.230> knee

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
really know what the knee

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:37.910 
really know what the knee
all<00:02:34.830> these<00:02:34.980> things<00:02:35.250> are<00:02:35.459> so<00:02:36.560> if<00:02:37.560> you<00:02:37.709> want<00:02:37.860> to

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
all these things are so if you want to

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:39.350 
all these things are so if you want to
correct<00:02:38.010> me<00:02:38.280> in<00:02:38.340> the<00:02:38.370> comments<00:02:38.610> feel<00:02:39.060> free<00:02:39.090> to

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
correct me in the comments feel free to

correct me in the comments feel free to
do<00:02:39.569> so<00:02:40.190> so<00:02:41.190> basically<00:02:41.340> what<00:02:41.790> you<00:02:41.879> want<00:02:42.090> you

00:02:42.259 --> 00:02:42.269 
do so so basically what you want you

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:45.170 
do so so basically what you want you
want<00:02:42.480> those<00:02:42.780> two<00:02:43.110> pieces<00:02:43.430> to<00:02:44.430> touch<00:02:44.670> both<00:02:44.970> the

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
want those two pieces to touch both the

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:49.369 
want those two pieces to touch both the
ends<00:02:45.510> of<00:02:45.690> the<00:02:45.870> battery<00:02:46.819> like<00:02:47.819> so<00:02:48.239> to<00:02:48.870> get<00:02:49.019> your

00:02:49.369 --> 00:02:49.379 
ends of the battery like so to get your

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:53.509 
ends of the battery like so to get your
LED<00:02:50.310> light<00:02:50.550> to<00:02:50.790> light<00:02:51.000> up<00:02:51.239> and<00:02:52.099> you<00:02:53.099> want<00:02:53.280> to<00:02:53.430> go

00:02:53.509 --> 00:02:53.519 
LED light to light up and you want to go

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:55.130 
LED light to light up and you want to go
underneath<00:02:53.970> there<00:02:54.209> and<00:02:54.420> double<00:02:54.720> into<00:02:55.110> the

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
underneath there and double into the

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:57.110 
underneath there and double into the
lantern<00:02:55.620> so<00:02:56.489> the<00:02:56.549> first<00:02:56.760> thing<00:02:56.910> we're<00:02:57.030> gonna

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
lantern so the first thing we're gonna

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:00.650 
lantern so the first thing we're gonna
do<00:02:57.420> is<00:02:57.450> obviously<00:02:58.489> you<00:02:59.489> know<00:02:59.519> it's<00:03:00.330> not<00:03:00.510> going

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 
do is obviously you know it's not going

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:01.940 
do is obviously you know it's not going
to<00:03:00.750> do<00:03:00.870> that<00:03:01.019> because<00:03:01.200> there's<00:03:01.470> not<00:03:01.680> enough

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
to do that because there's not enough

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:08.479 
to do that because there's not enough
pressure<00:03:02.220> being<00:03:02.580> applied<00:03:02.700> down<00:03:07.280> so<00:03:08.280> we're

00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:08.489 
pressure being applied down so we're

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:19.430 
pressure being applied down so we're
going<00:03:08.610> to<00:03:08.670> take<00:03:08.940> some<00:03:09.209> tape

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:35.390 

just<00:03:20.070> some<00:03:20.280> regular<00:03:20.610> old<00:03:20.820> scotch<00:03:21.330> tape

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.400 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.380 

now<00:03:36.400> I'm<00:03:36.550> didn't<00:03:36.790> work<00:03:36.880> out<00:03:37.000> so<00:03:37.209> well<00:03:37.330> because

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:37.390 
now I'm didn't work out so well because

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:40.770 
now I'm didn't work out so well because
I'm<00:03:37.630> trying<00:03:37.840> to<00:03:37.930> watch<00:03:38.050> what<00:03:38.319> I'm<00:03:38.410> doing<00:03:39.780> and

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:40.780 
I'm trying to watch what I'm doing and

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:43.800 
I'm trying to watch what I'm doing and
make<00:03:41.260> sure<00:03:41.440> it's<00:03:41.590> in<00:03:41.680> frame<00:03:42.030> the<00:03:43.030> trick<00:03:43.569> to<00:03:43.720> it

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:43.810 
make sure it's in frame the trick to it

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:57.220 
make sure it's in frame the trick to it
is<00:03:43.870> that<00:03:44.020> you<00:03:44.110> need<00:03:44.290> pressure

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:57.230 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:00.309 

so<00:03:57.890> there<00:03:58.430> we<00:03:58.550> go<00:03:58.580> now<00:03:58.970> the<00:03:59.780> lanterns<00:04:00.140> gonna

00:04:00.309 --> 00:04:00.319 
so there we go now the lanterns gonna

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:02.140 
so there we go now the lanterns gonna
stay<00:04:00.560> on<00:04:00.739> and<00:04:00.950> every<00:04:01.190> time<00:04:01.400> you<00:04:01.580> want<00:04:01.819> to<00:04:01.910> take

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:02.150 
stay on and every time you want to take

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:04.570 
stay on and every time you want to take
this<00:04:02.330> off<00:04:02.560> you<00:04:03.560> are<00:04:03.709> gonna<00:04:03.830> have<00:04:04.069> to<00:04:04.160> undo<00:04:04.430> the

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:04.580 
this off you are gonna have to undo the

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:12.369 
this off you are gonna have to undo the
tape<00:04:06.099> there's<00:04:07.099> that<00:04:10.629> I'm<00:04:11.629> pretty<00:04:11.870> certain<00:04:12.230> a

00:04:12.369 --> 00:04:12.379 
tape there's that I'm pretty certain a

00:04:12.379 --> 00:04:14.080 
tape there's that I'm pretty certain a
lot<00:04:12.650> of<00:04:12.739> other<00:04:12.890> customizers<00:04:13.519> out<00:04:13.700> there<00:04:13.880> are

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:14.090 
lot of other customizers out there are

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:15.610 
lot of other customizers out there are
gonna<00:04:14.209> come<00:04:14.420> up<00:04:14.450> with<00:04:14.569> some<00:04:14.810> other<00:04:14.900> cool<00:04:15.170> ideas

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:15.620 
gonna come up with some other cool ideas

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:17.890 
gonna come up with some other cool ideas
but<00:04:15.860> this<00:04:16.010> was<00:04:16.190> just<00:04:16.220> a<00:04:16.729> real<00:04:17.239> quick<00:04:17.419> thing<00:04:17.690> I

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:17.900 
but this was just a real quick thing I

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:19.330 
but this was just a real quick thing I
needed<00:04:18.079> to<00:04:18.200> come<00:04:18.410> up<00:04:18.560> with<00:04:18.650> something<00:04:18.889> in<00:04:19.220> an

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:19.340 
needed to come up with something in an

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:24.420 
needed to come up with something in an
afternoon<00:04:19.989> to<00:04:20.989> get<00:04:21.109> this<00:04:21.320> stop-motion<00:04:22.280> going

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:24.430 
afternoon to get this stop-motion going

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:28.300 
afternoon to get this stop-motion going
so<00:04:25.720> again<00:04:26.720> I<00:04:26.750> wish<00:04:27.020> the<00:04:27.229> battery<00:04:27.560> was<00:04:27.710> a<00:04:27.740> little

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:28.310 
so again I wish the battery was a little

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:31.390 
so again I wish the battery was a little
bit<00:04:28.430> smaller<00:04:28.790> so<00:04:28.970> he<00:04:29.360> could<00:04:29.540> fit<00:04:29.900> a<00:04:30.250> lot<00:04:31.250> more

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:31.400 
bit smaller so he could fit a lot more

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:33.670 
bit smaller so he could fit a lot more
easily<00:04:31.580> in<00:04:31.880> there<00:04:32.090> and<00:04:32.300> like<00:04:33.169> I<00:04:33.260> said<00:04:33.320> some

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:33.680 
easily in there and like I said some

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:35.170 
easily in there and like I said some
other<00:04:33.740> customizers<00:04:34.370> are<00:04:34.610> like<00:04:34.880> they're

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:35.180 
other customizers are like they're

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:36.340 
other customizers are like they're
probably<00:04:35.270> gonna<00:04:35.510> come<00:04:35.600> up<00:04:35.840> with<00:04:35.990> something<00:04:36.260> a

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:36.350 
probably gonna come up with something a

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:39.940 
probably gonna come up with something a
lot<00:04:36.680> easier<00:04:37.130> and<00:04:37.460> a<00:04:37.910> lot<00:04:38.060> more<00:04:38.770> just<00:04:39.770> a<00:04:39.800> little

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:39.950 
lot easier and a lot more just a little

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:41.200 
lot easier and a lot more just a little
bit<00:04:40.040> cooler<00:04:40.220> to<00:04:40.400> work<00:04:40.520> and<00:04:40.700> hide<00:04:40.790> the<00:04:40.940> battery

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:41.210 
bit cooler to work and hide the battery

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:42.670 
bit cooler to work and hide the battery
in<00:04:41.330> the<00:04:41.360> light<00:04:41.600> more<00:04:41.810> and<00:04:41.870> probably<00:04:42.380> they'll

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:42.680 
in the light more and probably they'll

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:44.200 
in the light more and probably they'll
come<00:04:42.919> up<00:04:42.950> with<00:04:43.070> a<00:04:43.190> system<00:04:43.610> that<00:04:43.639> could<00:04:43.910> shut<00:04:44.060> it

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:44.210 
come up with a system that could shut it

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:46.210 
come up with a system that could shut it
on<00:04:44.300> and<00:04:44.479> off<00:04:44.570> this<00:04:45.200> is<00:04:45.410> just<00:04:45.650> to<00:04:45.770> get<00:04:45.889> you<00:04:46.040> guys

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:46.220 
on and off this is just to get you guys

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:50.830 
on and off this is just to get you guys
started<00:04:48.130> so<00:04:49.130> then<00:04:49.250> you<00:04:49.370> want<00:04:49.520> to<00:04:49.550> set<00:04:49.820> your<00:04:50.180> LED

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:50.840 
started so then you want to set your LED

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:52.870 
started so then you want to set your LED
light<00:04:51.050> your<00:04:51.229> battery<00:04:51.560> into<00:04:52.070> the<00:04:52.400> bottom<00:04:52.760> of

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:52.880 
light your battery into the bottom of

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:55.750 
light your battery into the bottom of
the<00:04:52.970> lantern<00:04:53.150> right<00:04:53.540> there<00:04:53.960> and<00:04:54.370> then<00:04:55.370> we<00:04:55.550> want

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:55.760 
the lantern right there and then we want

00:04:55.760 --> 00:05:00.909 
the lantern right there and then we want
it<00:04:55.850> to<00:04:56.000> stay<00:04:58.540> so<00:04:59.540> then<00:04:59.780> I<00:04:59.990> just<00:05:00.260> took<00:05:00.470> a<00:05:00.530> piece

00:05:00.909 --> 00:05:00.919 
it to stay so then I just took a piece

00:05:00.919 --> 00:05:05.710 
it to stay so then I just took a piece
of<00:05:01.100> scotch<00:05:01.340> tape<00:05:01.639> and<00:05:03.220> I<00:05:04.220> put<00:05:04.520> it<00:05:04.610> across<00:05:04.729> just

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:05.720 
of scotch tape and I put it across just

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:15.700 
of scotch tape and I put it across just
like<00:05:05.930> that
