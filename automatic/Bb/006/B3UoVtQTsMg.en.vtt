00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:21.810
 video of me in this video I would like 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:24.090
 like to use the simple script creator in ssc 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.070
 Imagine what is the thing 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.269
 I had such a similar tool back then 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.130
 ever made that your car 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:31.349
 login creator as the name implies 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.719
 kunzmann so car logins and could 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:35.550
 Programming without programming knowledge 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:37.500
 to have one what he is, so to speak 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:41.100
 from single steps together so i have 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.899
 the ones mentioned here well i have this here 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:46.440
 ding nor the goflex login of fun 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:48.960
 had called but ultimately just 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.059
 what else do autologous ins 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:54.329
 tinker so small pots of those presses 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:56.910
 on key xy or you are in the game 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:59.090
 and then will stop just stop various 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.899
 combination of skills filled out 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:04.470
 executed because of course I can say 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:06.659
 click and the button w where then skill xy 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.869
 wait 5/100 seconds pressed 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:11.130
 again or another 

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:12.360
 the thing is very powerful in any case 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:16.290
 and it will also grow 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:18.360
 At the moment you can just click on programs 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.850
 execute keyboard shortcuts 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:23.420
 or just send buttons 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:26.040
 on the window it was active and 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:28.110
 So stop waiting so do not sleep 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.430
 so I just feel like a test 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.820
 that you have something under it 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:34.020
 but I can still imagine 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.640
 do something briefly 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.229
 I have re-inserted this as you can here 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.390
 select the coordinates for the clicks 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:41.780
 can 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:44.340
 but I have to say first click now 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:46.549
 Did he choose this I say up here 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:49.619
 google right click that's ok 

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:51.270
 save is saved and now 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:53.340
 I say but running fairly 'needs 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:57.140
 of course firefox close and cheats 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:02:01.590
 I say then now we see so 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:02.969
 funny pekings then run it otherwise 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.530
 wait a moment until the song commands 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:06.990
 end it sounds in there and sends 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.849
 directly abc abc er 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.410
 because the script is completed then 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:13.080
 I'll go out again about the steps 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:14.849
 killen and here the dear pure packing 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.250
 because I want him to be the gailinger 

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:22.500
 you see from 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:24.569
 mansory plus 2 now you can see here 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:26.010
 one animates such funny pigments one 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:28.430
 sees a hook when it's done and 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:31.709
 the progress was of course also 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:33.410
 later if that's the release we are 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:35.870
 have also here for example this 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:38.610
 language setting english german 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:40.620
 Of course I would be very satisfied 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:41.760
 if I am paid for this 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.930
 work because I will do that 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:45.140
 probably for free 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:47.940
 put 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:49.980
 and yes my youtube channel is 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:50.580
 Of course, in that too cpp laid that 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.470
 usual stop 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:54.060
 Well, I hope you can do that later 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:55.380
 what to do once i release this 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:57.420
 look forward to it 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:59.700
 still quite a few functions to 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:01.680
 example macros records so 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:07.099
 take you doing what makes before 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:07.099
 then afterwards to Denne Torri
