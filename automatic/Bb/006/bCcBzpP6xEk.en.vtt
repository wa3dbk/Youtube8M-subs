 train wreck that is not usual 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:10.679
 shock of ships but there was between the 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.650
 Argentine sandpit turbid river that was 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:15.360
 rammed by the Paraguayan tugboat 

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:16.920
 Had water fence this motion instead 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.680
 there is a great hall and you will see how they are 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:22.170
 very good morning fabian good day we 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.960
 we found in the prefecture building 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:27.180
 here in zÃ¡rate as a reason we do not go 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:30.119
 to review this accident fabian like you 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:32.700
 you commented it took place 3 and 58 of the 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:35.309
 early morning at kilometer 101 of the river 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.800
 parana of the palms the murky river had 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:40.649
 party on Friday from san pedro with 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.780
 2,200 tons of sand and traveled towards 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:45.329
 Buenos Aires from where the ship 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.879
 Paraguayan had been the same afternoon 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.860
 loaded with containers and we were 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:53.850
 explaining fabian how was the dialogue 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:56.489
 prior to collision to the collision 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.469
 is coming over they alerted from the 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:01.199
 murky river but from the boat 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:02.820
 Paraguayan responded calmly not what 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:05.339
 I'm controlling what I'm controlling 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.020
 said from the Paraguayan vessel after 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.420
 a few minutes 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.520
 the Paraguayan ship warned that it no longer 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:14.460
 could control and so the 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.380
 shock the information we have is that 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:19.170
 the Argentine ship sank in three 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:21.240
 minutes caused him an opening of 15 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.069
 meters long by a meter and a half 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:26.069
 height below the waterline 

00:01:23.069 --> 00:01:28.979
 where thousands of liters of 

00:01:26.069 --> 00:01:32.759
 water in seconds eight crew had 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:34.860
 this Argentinian ship sandbox and we 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:37.860
 government here we are in the 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.989
 building of the zarate prefecture with 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.060
 jose the disembarked and with I was 

00:01:39.989 --> 00:01:44.009
 commenting that Saturday night he played 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.200
 performed early in the morning but the software 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:48.539
 night he knew he could have produced 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.610
 another accident also with a ship 

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:53.369
 Paraguayan Jose Buendia were tell us 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:55.130
 please good morning and last night they arrive 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:57.690
 good good places I was commenting 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:02:01.380
 of what 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:04.680
 there at the height of the island the pigeon 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:06.940
 it was on another Paraguayan ship above 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:09.560
 there was almost another accident 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:13.490
 great that we had after after 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:15.920
 this one of this accident so I do not know 

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:19.670
 I wanted to leave here because to see 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:22.160
 If I do not know who has responsibilities 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:23.900
 of this so we can do something because if 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:25.610
 not at any time to be able to build 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:28.730
 another accident with I know how he finds out about 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:31.790
 the news you and the Saturday do of the 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:34.130
 tomorrow grabs my brother calls you 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:37.730
 I was on the sandbox and I lowered the 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:40.790
 Friday and he calls me I realized that the 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:43.640
 river is cloudy and an accident 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:45.439
 well then I communicated with my 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:48.079
 capital because I'm also shipped 

00:02:45.439 --> 00:02:51.140
 then they tell me that yes there was 

00:02:48.079 --> 00:02:53.959
 an accident and that there was a possibility 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:57.350
 of life because the noise was heard 

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:59.690
 inside but nothing 

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:00.950
 I could not better hear you I do not know what 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:03.050
 how is he doing good morning fabian 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:06.580
 doman salutes them joseph first question 

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:10.990
 what does it mean in marked 

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:13.360
 the market that we work in the river that 

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:15.569
 We sail every few years makes it 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:19.579
 you are on board 

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:23.519
 how many years ten years ago ten years 

00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:25.829
 eight years I was in the fishing and now it goes 

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:29.420
 to be three years that I am here the sand and 

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:29.420
 always makes the path of the parana 

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:36.370
 three years so I'm sailing 

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:38.230
 the river but I do not know this not from a shock 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:41.410
 because it is clear that it is not usual 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:45.090
 but that a ship passes so close to 

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:45.090
 another is usual 

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:53.570
 and sure in the place you saw because here 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:58.390
 there are times in the turns that view 

00:03:53.570 --> 00:04:01.750
 teacher these seek with many t 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:04.440
 Girl is that as she is told 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:08.050
 not out there they can not control them and 

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:12.850
 happens what happens because of that I do not know why 

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:14.980
 I met everyone with Jose when he 

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:17.470
 says because they say it's the last phrase 

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:19.840
 of the person in charge of the boat 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:22.240
 Paraguayan to Argentina that I can not 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:24.160
 control I can not control it that's 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:26.590
 depending on the weight depending on the 

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:30.270
 speed based on the weight of the 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:30.270
 speed and geography of the river 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:37.919
 and I would believe that by bringing a lot of weight and 

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:41.110
 be very long with all the brands that 

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:45.220
 brings has very little government 

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:48.210
 maybe it might be that I do not have 

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:48.210
 enough machine 

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:53.370
 and of course also influences the 

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:57.690
 current 

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:59.940
 6 also influenced the current and last night 

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:03.500
 last night my brother told me that they 

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:08.010
 they were well pound height the pigeon and 

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:10.410
 another assails almost no other Paraguayan 

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:12.060
 many that there are three of you 

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:15.330
 years doing this route there is a lot 

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:17.630
 traffic more than what there were months ago 

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:17.630
 the same 

00:05:18.969 --> 00:05:23.229
 at night listen well I do not say there's a lot 

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:26.590
 There is a lot of traffic in the parana 

00:05:23.229 --> 00:05:29.320
 more than usual is the usual 

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:31.300
 and if very traffic and I always avoided according to 

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:34.150
 the schedule that 

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:37.900
 you are sailing around the day we have 

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:40.960
 traffic out there at night out there 

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:44.470
 You find nobody, what do I know? 

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:46.510
 this is so well jose I thank you 

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:50.130
 much 

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:52.840
 well thank you very much wanted 

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:56.610
 emphasize this of the Paraguayan look 

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:59.759
 because we do not want to be called this 

00:05:56.610 --> 00:06:03.479
 at hours of the accident we almost suffered another 

00:05:59.759 --> 00:06:06.210
 accident and do not know the authorities that 

00:06:03.479 --> 00:06:08.639
 have to do with this but be able to 

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:10.080
 handle because if this is not going to continue 

00:06:08.639 --> 00:06:11.910
 without being perfect 

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:13.800
 thanks Jose 

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:15.330
 good thanks to the big problem I do not 

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:17.670
 I think there is a question that I have to 

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:20.670
 see with the nationality of the commander 

00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:21.420
 of the captain or the punctual pilot but 

00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:24.740
 that has to do with the 

00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:24.740
 individual irresponsibility
