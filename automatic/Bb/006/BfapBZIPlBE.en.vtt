did a heck of a job and Jordan reads a

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:29.990 
did a heck of a job and Jordan reads a
hell<00:00:28.619> of<00:00:28.650> a<00:00:28.740> player<00:00:28.949> I<00:00:29.130> mean<00:00:29.369> Jordan<00:00:29.670> Reed<00:00:29.820> did

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
hell of a player I mean Jordan Reed did

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.790 
hell of a player I mean Jordan Reed did
a<00:00:30.060> great<00:00:30.330> job<00:00:30.359> moving<00:00:30.990> that<00:00:31.140> offense<00:00:31.529> we<00:00:31.650> did

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
a great job moving that offense we did

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.160 
a great job moving that offense we did
up-tempo<00:00:32.099> I<00:00:32.250> think<00:00:32.579> we<00:00:32.730> I<00:00:32.940> think<00:00:33.750> they<00:00:34.050> were

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
up-tempo I think we I think they were

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:35.209 
up-tempo I think we I think they were
out<00:00:34.440> a<00:00:34.469> little<00:00:34.620> bit<00:00:34.739> because<00:00:34.860> we<00:00:35.010> kept

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
out a little bit because we kept

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.040 
out a little bit because we kept
possession<00:00:35.880> time<00:00:36.360> I<00:00:36.390> haven't<00:00:36.690> seen<00:00:36.840> that<00:00:36.899> yet

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
possession time I haven't seen that yet

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.950 
possession time I haven't seen that yet
but<00:00:37.350> I<00:00:37.410> think<00:00:37.440> possession<00:00:37.980> time<00:00:38.190> was

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:38.960 
but I think possession time was

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:40.700 
but I think possession time was
substantial<00:00:39.960> for<00:00:40.110> the<00:00:40.170> Gators<00:00:40.469> in<00:00:40.590> that

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
substantial for the Gators in that

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:41.990 
substantial for the Gators in that
second<00:00:41.040> half<00:00:41.190> and<00:00:41.309> you<00:00:41.370> could<00:00:41.489> see<00:00:41.670> him<00:00:41.760> start

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
second half and you could see him start

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.270 
second half and you could see him start
to<00:00:42.090> give<00:00:42.239> a<00:00:42.270> little<00:00:42.540> bit<00:00:42.660> so<00:00:42.899> and<00:00:43.770> our<00:00:43.890> defense

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
to give a little bit so and our defense

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:45.560 
to give a little bit so and our defense
is<00:00:44.399> hanging<00:00:44.700> in<00:00:44.789> there<00:00:44.910> whole<00:00:45.059> game<00:00:45.090> and<00:00:45.300> we

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
is hanging in there whole game and we

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.660 
is hanging in there whole game and we
were<00:00:45.840> awful<00:00:46.230> in<00:00:46.320> the<00:00:46.350> first<00:00:46.620> half<00:00:46.800> on<00:00:47.520> offense

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
were awful in the first half on offense

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.760 
were awful in the first half on offense
but<00:00:48.210> we<00:00:48.300> came<00:00:48.510> back<00:00:48.690> with<00:00:48.899> special<00:00:49.230> teams<00:00:49.500> and

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
but we came back with special teams and

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.380 
but we came back with special teams and
and<00:00:49.890> the<00:00:50.370> second<00:00:50.700> half<00:00:50.820> our<00:00:50.969> Upton's<00:00:51.239> played

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
and the second half our Upton's played

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.560

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510 
some of our receivers thinking we might

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:07.730 
some of our receivers thinking we might
