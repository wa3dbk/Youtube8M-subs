00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.110
 you just do everything once it 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.220

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:25.680
 in mp9 with with numbers 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:29.430
 ok that slide is over yes hardline and 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.720
 stage a star that is a year old pp 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.259
 do you like with cities in how do you 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.570
 fire 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:34.829
 yes no because you play before people go 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.360
 response should've been her 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:38.340
 use the young topical one him jets 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.509
 to use and no shit but I have 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.240
 not even to a that sound 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:43.710
 yes number fish plays he prepares set 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.970
 but does not always use and he plays 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.890
 so those without a headset do not switch off 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.420
 feeling of well, I might as well 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.890
 not really the shit I have that together 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.229
 not super necessary 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:54.270
 you go more for the offensive 

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:56.310
 and what you are doing here is not good like 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.469
 you often say to the back of that shit 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.759
 some years other but yes yes you should not 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:03.930
 chasing someone that's one 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:05.729
 deadly in vivo damage then you have me 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:07.229
 went and brought window 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:08.759
 take their own walk yes what we do 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.780
 nine out of ten cases cleans you 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:13.500
 then with a decent 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:15.120
 yes and irritation of criteria yes and like 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.080
 You see already you make your first def was 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:18.300
 very nice 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:21.900
 yes that is without trace after someone who 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:23.459
 clement is an inch next to each other 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:25.020
 unbelievable that the weena and hot or 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:26.550
 rather already actual relationship with the 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:27.840
 very little is played in previous shorts 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:29.760
 play rather it is being able to game 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:32.310
 so as to play the role such 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:35.040
 yes and that came through of your ideas with 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:36.090
 everything is 16 maps so you need 16 17 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.769
 isn't going either 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:39.480
 yes yes but also really download to there 

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:41.280
 any problems he him the 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:43.860
 downloadable knife or that will play 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:46.410
 how the edge throws in that hoarse and the 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:48.239
 second i have more fun 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:49.590
 jan you play and with the filter 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:51.420
 taken off with you nothing else 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:52.739
 so remove the local filter from the 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:54.660
 players against 

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:56.220
 place of england the netherlands and normal 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:58.140
 are but in belgium luxembourg germany 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:02.640
 france you get 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:04.830
 east timor tanzania when i just got the 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:06.390
 windmill can stand for this we know 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:08.310
 are windmills for internet so yes that 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:11.040
 would have a degree in life then 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:12.360
 well me there is the disadvantage so yes so we 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:14.159
 those here we have to look at hatrival so 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:15.810
 We still do 17 maps including tour 

00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:19.220
 just us you fuses actually 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:21.629
 and that also sleeps nicely and for days 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:23.640
 you love it is your favorite maps yes 

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:25.319
 bootleg is just for flying or is 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:27.900
 hard it just nicer bad or something 

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:29.519
 but the sponge is synonymous with that 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:30.870
 example in this crippled real 

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:31.620
 terrible yes we are actually up 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:33.620
 all jokes 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:36.599
 Jenny once yes I think it's best 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:38.670
 the game play cells larger maps than full 

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:40.379
 and so is a dragon of the map and bacana 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:41.940
 but for those forchini not bullshit 

00:03:40.379 --> 00:03:42.280
 with plays together and not done in 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:43.870
 a 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:45.760
 you need you just have to google to 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:47.500
 because they have to look for where they are 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:49.060
 yes yes and the intention is actually also 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:52.270
 a little bit around or five minutes 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:54.880
 this just a little longer than 5 minutes 35 

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:56.380
 but don't hurt if you don't 

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:58.240
 act that it is also content 

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:59.260
 Russians are and you already had because 

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:00.850
 the lobby 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:03.010
 I see that as a toes vision for you and you 

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:04.900
 and 4 5 kills in a row 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:06.790
 yes and then you do n't see those guys very much 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:08.319
 so but you really ca n't survive 

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:09.940
 that is just seeing without 

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:12.280
 take it comes that those anne's spirit 

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:13.780
 those are those who have learned level and 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:16.090
 have done our odd jobs for them 

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:17.890
 startled there trial 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:20.739
 yes and you have that frivolously there yourself 

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:22.510
 for the you often now on his son 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:24.940
 it is already becoming green like this 

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:26.650
 known a lot and the sponge and bad 

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:28.000
 yes but still see you get there every week 

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:30.070
 youtube you can easily it is less 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.870
 don't be concerned about you 

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:35.800
 Snake know this we have been busy for a long time 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:39.400
 this session of 3 I assume he just 

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:41.229
 page around my 3020 will take you there so 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:42.610
 also towards you I myself want your goal 

00:04:41.229 --> 00:04:43.570
 that you have a minimum 

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:45.880
 number 

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:47.169
 des have or I live the no floor 

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:49.270
 of the week is not all that happens 

00:04:47.169 --> 00:04:51.130
 happens yes these are not 

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:53.710
 these are not those graphics your ipad 

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:55.750
 plays appeared and will therefore be somewhere 

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:57.760
 I really wanted to tell you this is what I have 

00:04:55.750 --> 00:05:00.940
 a matches in 90 the guys and it 

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:02.919
 was also at 290 the kills and negative 

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:04.810
 foe me and I had someone else 

00:05:02.919 --> 00:05:08.680
 wonderman 40 kills I'm not coming at all 

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:11.380
 must be against and I normally that is there 

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:15.880
 Three things you did then 

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:17.320
 no and after pp good for this type of knife 

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:19.000
 boys will not go to bathroom 

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:21.130
 so the weapons really just play 

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.449
 again for this kind of maps and prohibition 

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:24.009
 wealth 

00:05:22.449 --> 00:05:26.139
 the small knife just can sit anyway 

00:05:24.009 --> 00:05:26.499
 good weapon yes cecil up down 12 me can 

00:05:26.139 --> 00:05:28.539
 play 

00:05:26.499 --> 00:05:30.639
 We will first start a lot with it 

00:05:28.539 --> 00:05:32.979
 pp 90 but nowadays a piece 

00:05:30.639 --> 00:05:34.479
 less actually why were we you 

00:05:32.979 --> 00:05:35.740
 no no I do not anymore, but I 

00:05:34.479 --> 00:05:37.120
 watched you from the beginning know that here 

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:38.589

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:40.059
 van der Heren and bars and that you just 

00:05:38.589 --> 00:05:41.680
 but that the cakes that blow dry 

00:05:40.059 --> 00:05:43.629
 and it's also because you get used to it 

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:44.889
 about glassdoor npcf a pear if you have 

00:05:43.629 --> 00:05:46.449

00:05:44.889 --> 00:05:46.930
 really hope you are a small people 

00:05:46.449 --> 00:05:48.249
 saves 

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:51.099

00:05:55.449 --> 00:06:00.810
 don't forget to give a like 

00:05:57.189 --> 00:06:00.810
