the<00:01:31.770> best<00:01:31.979> way<00:01:32.159> to<00:01:32.189> make<00:01:32.490> gold<00:01:32.729> that<00:01:32.909> I<00:01:33.000> have

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
the best way to make gold that I have

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.149 
the best way to make gold that I have
found<00:01:33.360> in<00:01:33.479> the<00:01:33.540> game<00:01:33.750> so<00:01:34.079> far<00:01:34.439> I've<00:01:34.860> tried<00:01:35.130> a

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
found in the game so far I've tried a

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:36.560 
found in the game so far I've tried a
bit<00:01:35.280> of<00:01:35.400> fishing<00:01:35.610> in<00:01:35.820> that<00:01:35.850> kind<00:01:36.150> of<00:01:36.240> stuff<00:01:36.420> but

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
bit of fishing in that kind of stuff but

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:37.760 
bit of fishing in that kind of stuff but
nothing<00:01:36.900> adds<00:01:37.049> up<00:01:37.229> to<00:01:37.290> the<00:01:37.439> amount<00:01:37.650> of<00:01:37.710> gold

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
nothing adds up to the amount of gold

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.590 
nothing adds up to the amount of gold
you<00:01:38.130> can<00:01:38.280> make<00:01:38.460> from<00:01:38.700> this<00:01:38.850> obviously<00:01:39.420> the

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
you can make from this obviously the

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:40.880 
you can make from this obviously the
downside<00:01:40.049> is<00:01:40.229> that<00:01:40.259> you<00:01:40.350> do<00:01:40.470> need<00:01:40.650> a<00:01:40.680> lot<00:01:40.799> of

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
downside is that you do need a lot of

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.230 
downside is that you do need a lot of
people<00:01:41.189> to<00:01:41.280> do<00:01:41.400> this<00:01:41.549> because<00:01:41.790> you're<00:01:42.000> gonna

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
people to do this because you're gonna

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.789 
people to do this because you're gonna
run<00:01:42.360> into<00:01:42.390> pirates<00:01:43.049> and<00:01:43.200> just<00:01:43.350> other<00:01:43.500> people

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.050 
didn't manage to fill the ships up to
capacity<00:02:34.860> which<00:02:35.430> was<00:02:35.580> a<00:02:35.610> little<00:02:35.970> bit

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
capacity which was a little bit

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:37.670 
capacity which was a little bit
disappointing<00:02:36.630> but<00:02:36.990> we've<00:02:37.140> still<00:02:37.320> got<00:02:37.470> a<00:02:37.500> lot

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
disappointing but we've still got a lot

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:38.990 
disappointing but we've still got a lot
of<00:02:37.710> packs<00:02:37.980> here<00:02:38.190> and<00:02:38.430> we're<00:02:38.580> heading<00:02:38.790> out<00:02:38.910> to

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
of packs here and we're heading out to

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.670 
of packs here and we're heading out to
the<00:02:39.060> island<00:02:39.390> so<00:02:39.570> you<00:02:39.930> can<00:02:40.080> see<00:02:40.290> just<00:02:40.500> me

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
the island so you can see just me

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.260 
the island so you can see just me
showing<00:02:40.890> you<00:02:41.010> the<00:02:41.130> island<00:02:41.310> there<00:02:41.670> it<00:02:41.850> is<00:02:42.000> quite

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:42.270 
showing you the island there it is quite

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:43.850 
showing you the island there it is quite
a<00:02:42.300> trek<00:02:42.570> to<00:02:42.600> get<00:02:42.900> there<00:02:43.140> so<00:02:43.350> you<00:02:43.410> definitely

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 
a trek to get there so you definitely

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:45.230 
a trek to get there so you definitely
and<00:02:43.980> make<00:02:44.070> sure<00:02:44.190> you<00:02:44.280> put<00:02:44.460> that<00:02:44.490> protection<00:02:44.970> so

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:45.240 
and make sure you put that protection so

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:47.060 
and make sure you put that protection so
that<00:02:45.360> you<00:02:45.420> definitely<00:02:45.660> can<00:02:46.110> make<00:02:46.380> it<00:02:46.590> but<00:02:46.860> I<00:02:46.920> am

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:47.070 
that you definitely can make it but I am

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:48.380 
that you definitely can make it but I am
just<00:02:47.100> gonna<00:02:47.280> skip<00:02:47.550> a<00:02:47.640> little<00:02:47.850> further<00:02:48.060> into

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
just gonna skip a little further into

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:50.000 
just gonna skip a little further into
the<00:02:48.510> journey<00:02:48.810> and<00:02:49.140> show<00:02:49.470> you<00:02:49.530> a<00:02:49.620> little<00:02:49.890> bit

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
the journey and show you a little bit

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:51.710 
the journey and show you a little bit
more<00:02:50.250> of<00:02:50.520> the<00:02:50.640> stuff<00:02:50.820> closer<00:02:51.120> to<00:02:51.420> the<00:02:51.540> island

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
more of the stuff closer to the island

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.450 
more of the stuff closer to the island
now<00:02:52.200> you<00:02:52.260> don't<00:02:52.500> necessarily<00:02:52.620> have<00:02:53.100> to<00:02:53.250> do

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:53.460 
now you don't necessarily have to do

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:55.130 
now you don't necessarily have to do
this<00:02:53.610> but<00:02:53.790> we<00:02:53.880> have<00:02:53.910> a<00:02:54.150> person<00:02:54.570> sitting<00:02:54.840> on<00:02:55.020> the

this but we have a person sitting on the

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:56.510 
this but we have a person sitting on the
island<00:02:55.440> actually<00:02:55.590> waiting<00:02:56.070> for<00:02:56.250> us<00:02:56.340> so

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:56.520 
island actually waiting for us so

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:57.860 
island actually waiting for us so
they're<00:02:56.700> sitting<00:02:57.000> at<00:02:57.120> the<00:02:57.240> trade<00:02:57.480> vendors

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
they're sitting at the trade vendors

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:59.630 
they're sitting at the trade vendors

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
they are just patrolling it making sure

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:03.410

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
got a good report on what's going to be

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:08.420 
got a good report on what's going to be
around<00:03:06.810> when<00:03:07.140> we<00:03:07.200> get<00:03:07.410> there<00:03:07.680> but<00:03:08.040> you<00:03:08.160> can<00:03:08.280> see

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
around when we get there but you can see

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:09.860 
around when we get there but you can see
there's<00:03:08.610> the<00:03:08.730> Kuro<00:03:08.910> star<00:03:09.180> and<00:03:09.360> gold<00:03:09.630> trader

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 
there's the Kuro star and gold trader

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:10.910 
there's the Kuro star and gold trader
just<00:03:10.110> there<00:03:10.230> in<00:03:10.320> the<00:03:10.410> middle<00:03:10.590> of<00:03:10.620> the<00:03:10.710> main

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:10.920 
just there in the middle of the main

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:12.740 
just there in the middle of the main
island<00:03:11.400> we<00:03:11.790> are<00:03:11.910> heading<00:03:12.210> to<00:03:12.330> this<00:03:12.420> little

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
island we are heading to this little

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:15.050 
island we are heading to this little
island<00:03:12.900> towards<00:03:13.380> the<00:03:13.470> southwest<00:03:14.250> here<00:03:14.610> just

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 
island towards the southwest here just

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:16.550 
island towards the southwest here just
because<00:03:15.390> there<00:03:15.570> are<00:03:15.600> these<00:03:15.810> cannons<00:03:16.290> there<00:03:16.440> so

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
because there are these cannons there so

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:17.990 
because there are these cannons there so
if<00:03:16.680> you<00:03:16.740> get<00:03:16.860> attacked<00:03:16.950> the<00:03:17.460> cannons<00:03:17.820> will

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
if you get attacked the cannons will

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.300 
if you get attacked the cannons will
defend<00:03:18.390> you<00:03:18.570> because<00:03:18.960> it<00:03:19.200> is<00:03:19.320> a<00:03:19.350> war<00:03:19.680> zone<00:03:19.710> so

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
defend you because it is a war zone so

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:22.580 
defend you because it is a war zone so
we<00:03:20.580> park<00:03:20.880> up<00:03:21.030> to<00:03:21.240> ships<00:03:21.540> here<00:03:21.840> and<00:03:22.080> we<00:03:22.170> take<00:03:22.350> one

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
we park up to ships here and we take one

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:24.140 
we park up to ships here and we take one
in<00:03:22.770> with<00:03:22.920> everyone<00:03:23.250> on<00:03:23.520> it<00:03:23.550> you<00:03:23.880> see<00:03:23.910> obviously

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
in with everyone on it you see obviously

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:26.120 
in with everyone on it you see obviously
we<00:03:24.480> leave<00:03:24.600> one<00:03:24.900> person<00:03:25.290> on<00:03:25.410> the<00:03:25.500> helm<00:03:25.740> of<00:03:25.890> each

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:26.130 
we leave one person on the helm of each

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:28.310 
we leave one person on the helm of each
ship<00:03:26.550> so<00:03:26.970> this<00:03:27.180> is<00:03:27.300> the<00:03:27.390> best<00:03:27.690> way<00:03:27.900> to<00:03:27.930> do<00:03:28.200> it

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:28.320 
ship so this is the best way to do it

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:29.960 
ship so this is the best way to do it
because<00:03:28.440> if<00:03:28.770> they<00:03:28.890> get<00:03:29.010> attacked<00:03:29.400> the<00:03:29.670> people

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970 
because if they get attacked the people

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:31.460 
because if they get attacked the people
who<00:03:30.180> are<00:03:30.510> attacking<00:03:30.960> them<00:03:31.020> are<00:03:31.140> gonna<00:03:31.290> die

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470 
who are attacking them are gonna die

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:33.410 
who are attacking them are gonna die
instantly<00:03:32.070> another<00:03:32.490> downside<00:03:32.850> is<00:03:33.270> you're

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:33.420 
instantly another downside is you're

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:35.180 
instantly another downside is you're
also<00:03:33.630> risking<00:03:34.290> your<00:03:34.470> own<00:03:34.590> money<00:03:34.920> and

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:35.190 
also risking your own money and

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:37.700 
also risking your own money and
materials<00:03:36.060> because<00:03:36.540> obviously<00:03:37.350> you<00:03:37.470> need<00:03:37.560> to

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:37.710 
materials because obviously you need to

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:38.900 
materials because obviously you need to
make<00:03:37.830> the<00:03:37.950> trade<00:03:38.130> pacts<00:03:38.370> and<00:03:38.550> bring<00:03:38.670> them<00:03:38.790> out

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:38.910 
make the trade pacts and bring them out

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:40.850 
make the trade pacts and bring them out
here<00:03:39.150> yourself<00:03:39.300> and<00:03:39.930> you<00:03:40.170> are<00:03:40.290> obviously<00:03:40.680> also

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:40.860 
here yourself and you are obviously also

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:42.830 
here yourself and you are obviously also
risking<00:03:41.310> your<00:03:41.520> ships<00:03:41.850> so<00:03:42.120> it<00:03:42.270> obviously<00:03:42.480> it's

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:42.840 
risking your ships so it obviously it's

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:44.420 
risking your ships so it obviously it's
that<00:03:42.990> risk<00:03:43.170> versus<00:03:43.440> reward<00:03:43.620> thing<00:03:44.010> so<00:03:44.220> it's

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:44.430 
that risk versus reward thing so it's

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:45.770 
that risk versus reward thing so it's
quite<00:03:44.610> a<00:03:44.670> large<00:03:44.850> risk<00:03:45.240> but<00:03:45.480> you're<00:03:45.570> getting<00:03:45.720> a

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:45.780 
quite a large risk but you're getting a

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:47.600 
quite a large risk but you're getting a
lot<00:03:45.930> of<00:03:45.990> reward<00:03:46.410> you<00:03:46.890> also<00:03:47.070> don't<00:03:47.340> need<00:03:47.460> to

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:47.610 
lot of reward you also don't need to

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:48.980 
lot of reward you also don't need to
head<00:03:47.760> all<00:03:48.000> the<00:03:48.180> way<00:03:48.210> up<00:03:48.390> to<00:03:48.480> this<00:03:48.570> island<00:03:48.960> to

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:48.990 
head all the way up to this island to

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:17.890 
the trade pacts when you're trying to

00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:19.410 
the trade pacts when you're trying to
like<00:06:18.340> trade<00:06:18.580> them<00:06:18.730> to<00:06:18.820> each<00:06:18.940> other<00:06:19.150> if<00:06:19.270> it's

00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:19.420 
like trade them to each other if it's

00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:21.330 
like trade them to each other if it's
not<00:06:19.600> yours<00:06:19.900> and<00:06:20.050> that<00:06:20.410> kind<00:06:20.620> of<00:06:20.680> stuff<00:06:20.890> so<00:06:20.920> it's

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:21.340 
not yours and that kind of stuff so it's

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:22.650 
not yours and that kind of stuff so it's
another<00:06:21.550> reason<00:06:21.670> to<00:06:22.000> have<00:06:22.090> the<00:06:22.240> tractor<00:06:22.630> out

00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:24.270 
another reason to have the tractor out
just<00:06:23.140> because<00:06:23.260> you<00:06:23.500> can<00:06:23.620> put<00:06:23.740> the<00:06:23.830> trade<00:06:24.040> packs

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:24.280 
just because you can put the trade packs

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:26.160 
just because you can put the trade packs
in<00:06:24.520> there<00:06:24.730> and<00:06:24.970> then<00:06:25.210> your<00:06:25.450> friendly<00:06:25.870> allies

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:26.170 
in there and then your friendly allies

00:06:26.170 --> 00:06:27.690 
in there and then your friendly allies
can<00:06:26.470> take<00:06:26.680> them<00:06:26.860> out<00:06:27.070> of<00:06:27.220> there<00:06:27.310> and<00:06:27.520> the

00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:27.700
