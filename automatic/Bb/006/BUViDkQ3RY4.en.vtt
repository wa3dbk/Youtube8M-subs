00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.160 
not gonna need it but I I suggest this
some<00:00:20.340> people<00:00:20.730> they'll<00:00:21.359> have<00:00:21.570> their<00:00:21.779> string

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
some people they'll have their string

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:27.980 
some people they'll have their string
and<00:00:22.640> they'll<00:00:23.640> tie<00:00:24.060> their<00:00:24.570> a<00:00:25.670> hook<00:00:26.670> on<00:00:26.849> and<00:00:27.150> then

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
and they'll tie their a hook on and then

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:29.720 
and they'll tie their a hook on and then
later<00:00:28.260> on<00:00:28.380> when<00:00:28.830> they<00:00:28.920> want<00:00:29.130> to<00:00:29.220> change<00:00:29.490> their

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
later on when they want to change their

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.429 
later on when they want to change their
laws<00:00:29.910> or<00:00:30.300> the<00:00:30.330> hooks<00:00:30.570> they're<00:00:31.050> just<00:00:31.230> going<00:00:31.349> to

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
laws or the hooks they're just going to

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.470 
laws or the hooks they're just going to
have<00:00:31.560> to<00:00:31.590> cut<00:00:31.890> it<00:00:31.920> off<00:00:32.099> and<00:00:32.369> eventually<00:00:33.090> that

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
have to cut it off and eventually that

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.010 
have to cut it off and eventually that
scene<00:00:33.719> is<00:00:33.780> going<00:00:33.899> to<00:00:33.960> wear<00:00:34.110> down<00:00:34.730> so<00:00:35.989> what<00:00:36.989> I

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
scene is going to wear down so what I

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.080 
scene is going to wear down so what I
found<00:00:37.350> out<00:00:37.530> is<00:00:37.590> you<00:00:38.040> can<00:00:38.190> get<00:00:38.370> one<00:00:38.520> of<00:00:38.640> these

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:41.090 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:46.600 

one<00:00:42.090> of<00:00:42.180> these<00:00:42.300> is<00:00:42.360> where<00:00:43.129> you<00:00:44.129> tie<00:00:44.399> one<00:00:45.030> end<00:00:45.059> to

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:46.610 
one of these is where you tie one end to

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:52.369 
one of these is where you tie one end to
the<00:00:47.610> string<00:00:48.390> and<00:00:49.340> the<00:00:50.340> other<00:00:50.520> end<00:00:50.789> is<00:00:51.000> for<00:00:51.379> just

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
the string and the other end is for just

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:55.490 
the string and the other end is for just
clipping<00:00:52.770> on<00:00:53.100> your<00:00:53.340> hook<00:00:53.579> or<00:00:53.820> lure<00:00:54.260> which<00:00:55.260> I

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
clipping on your hook or lure which I

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.279 
clipping on your hook or lure which I
suggest<00:00:55.949> which<00:00:56.160> is<00:00:56.340> a<00:00:56.370> lot<00:00:56.670> better<00:00:56.989> because<00:00:57.989> it

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
suggest which is a lot better because it

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.080 
suggest which is a lot better because it
saves<00:00:58.559> line<00:00:58.890> and<00:00:59.160> it's<00:00:59.280> easier<00:00:59.730> to<00:00:59.850> put<00:01:00.030> your

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
saves line and it's easier to put your

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.709 
saves line and it's easier to put your
hook<00:01:00.239> on<00:01:00.420> so<00:01:01.320> right<00:01:01.859> now<00:01:01.890> I<00:01:02.039> got<00:01:02.280> a<00:01:02.550> basic<00:01:03.539> cook

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
hook on so right now I got a basic cook

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:09.460 
hook on so right now I got a basic cook
about<00:01:04.019> the<00:01:04.199> size<00:01:04.439> for<00:01:05.119> medium<00:01:06.119> or<00:01:06.330> small<00:01:06.479> fish

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:09.470 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:16.039
