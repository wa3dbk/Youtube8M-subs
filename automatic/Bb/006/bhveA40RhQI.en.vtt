00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:28.220
 hello to all today we learn the 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.789
 cam at the airial 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:30.789
 we left 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:37.760
 so for the valerian case here is the 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:40.269
 foot placement 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:44.120
 well before a little diagonally undergo 

00:00:40.269 --> 00:00:46.039
 viard yesterday come flat on the teich 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:48.350
 imprudent the corner this is you who 

00:00:46.039 --> 00:00:51.530
 see at the displacement level where you 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:53.780
 are the most easterly we took the half 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:56.640
 acquired case 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:58.530
 to europe and easter 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.230
 it's about the same thing 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.660
 this time will have to cac and a 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:06.960
 rap just opened schools like 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:09.479
 for the cable is this time it's going 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:13.600
 have to open it but two tweaks of 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:15.430
 way to start a clothier rotation 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:17.230
 well entered from the foot 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:19.570
 for that we have it a little bit 

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:21.650
 diagonal and will not have any right as 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:23.870
 this 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:24.730
 and once you go into it 

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:28.810
 with 

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:31.840
 m arrived at the level of the Punjab 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:33.909
 it will have to turn quite branch 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:37.030
 quickly so as to finish the 

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:40.000
 rotation then you have two schools 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:42.700
 the one who make the cab to leiria in the air 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.360
 and who resumes all of a sudden or at the 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:47.409
 reception 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:51.250
 a small rivers to finish with us 

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:54.220
 angevins who slam and we pass a course 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:59.659
 we continue the rotation and there you have 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:02:01.969
 the choice to quickly turn the 360 

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:05.679
 to let the front fall and put 

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:09.399
 a little bigot to complete the rotation 

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:09.399
 we go to the example 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:20.970
 and that's it for today 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:22.430
 so I 'll see you soon for a 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:24.849
 next trip steam 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:24.849
 to him
