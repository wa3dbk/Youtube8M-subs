locks or traveling lock box in which he
he<00:00:20.340> loaded<00:00:20.550> it<00:00:20.670> with<00:00:20.820> a<00:00:20.850> bunch<00:00:21.060> of<00:00:21.150> locks<00:00:21.390> and

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
he loaded it with a bunch of locks and

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.029 
he loaded it with a bunch of locks and
he<00:00:21.689> just<00:00:21.960> sent<00:00:22.109> it<00:00:22.199> to<00:00:22.289> different<00:00:22.410> people<00:00:22.890> and

he just sent it to different people and

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:25.009 
he just sent it to different people and
each<00:00:23.130> each<00:00:23.730> person<00:00:24.150> would<00:00:24.240> pick<00:00:24.449> a<00:00:24.480> lock<00:00:24.720> and

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
each each person would pick a lock and

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.320 
each each person would pick a lock and
then<00:00:25.140> they<00:00:25.289> would<00:00:25.970> replace<00:00:26.970> it<00:00:27.210> with<00:00:27.300> another

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
then they would replace it with another

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.599 
then they would replace it with another
and<00:00:27.660> then<00:00:27.750> forwarded<00:00:28.140> to<00:00:28.199> someone<00:00:28.230> else<00:00:28.680> and

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
and then forwarded to someone else and

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.099 
and then forwarded to someone else and
when<00:00:30.000> I<00:00:30.060> talked<00:00:30.330> to<00:00:30.449> him<00:00:30.539> he<00:00:30.630> said<00:00:30.810> he's<00:00:30.990> only

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
when I talked to him he said he's only

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:32.810 
when I talked to him he said he's only
got<00:00:31.349> one<00:00:31.380> box<00:00:31.769> and<00:00:32.130> there's<00:00:32.250> a<00:00:32.309> lot<00:00:32.430> of<00:00:32.520> demand

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
got one box and there's a lot of demand

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.479 
got one box and there's a lot of demand
for<00:00:33.149> it<00:00:33.300> and<00:00:33.960> so<00:00:34.200> it<00:00:34.350> might<00:00:34.469> be<00:00:34.530> a<00:00:34.649> good<00:00:34.860> idea<00:00:34.980> to

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
for it and so it might be a good idea to

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.370 
for it and so it might be a good idea to
create<00:00:36.180> a<00:00:36.210> few<00:00:36.390> more<00:00:36.420> boxes<00:00:36.930> and<00:00:37.050> I<00:00:37.079> agree<00:00:37.350> with

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
create a few more boxes and I agree with

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.130 
create a few more boxes and I agree with
him<00:00:37.649> I<00:00:37.739> think<00:00:37.800> it's<00:00:38.040> a<00:00:38.129> great<00:00:38.370> idea<00:00:38.750> so<00:00:39.750> I<00:00:39.780> I

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
him I think it's a great idea so I I
