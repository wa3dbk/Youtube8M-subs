00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:09.660
 this three general units red 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:11.880
 the one that sugar is added direct 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.679
 out without snow which is a great French 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.450
 the one that I just want to be heard before 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:18.539
 to be added to the snow which is a 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:20.910
 Italian language and one that is clear 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:23.010
 Your engagement to Maria is a 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:26.519
 this to start with the basic tips 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:28.199
 to avoid certain and stay a good game is 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:29.099
 be careful where you beat the whites 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.750
 in snow 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:33.329
 preferably it is good to use classes of 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:36.030
 nox or light glass 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:38.040
 the program with the plastic balls that 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:41.219
 they are so chemically similar to 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:44.670
 oil that when we used oil 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:46.530
 in it even though limp did not leave 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.210
 completely this fat 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.640
 Of course it does not mean that it will not 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:55.230
 sure but the result will not be the 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:58.500
 It's not even going to be even better if 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:01.489
 be made a bowl of copper but like 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:04.019
 It is very difficult because the glass or stainless steel 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:06.990
 others need are also well dried and 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.189
 well in both and the eggs need to be in 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.540
 room temperature 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:13.170
 So let's start with a gift. 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:16.170
 French he oe cruel merengue less 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:19.310
 stable but it is ideal for making 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:22.799
 roasted preparations that are the sighs 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:25.259
 macarrons went the simplest of the 3 starts 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:28.080
 just above other whites and beat up 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:30.900
 quadruple volume and then the 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:33.150
 gradually work out 3 4 cups 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:36.329
 refined sugar is better than a 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:38.909
 super thin because you can not stay 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:41.340
 hospitals in the clear and there he 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:43.020
 develops much easier if 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.650
 Crystal sugar has to hit for more 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:48.230
 time and then just get some 

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:50.630
 rub and africa with the index finger 

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:51.380
 and the thumb for a long time teacher 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:54.170
 is alone 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:56.180
 if you do not feel it is perfect and ready 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:58.230
 episode converter can be of 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:03.510

 [Music] 

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:13.080
 The stable bnb it 's great for decorating 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:17.260
 the pies for the lemon pies the cake 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:20.140
 then starts to raise three whites and three 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:21.040
 4 cups sugar refined to the medium 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:23.230
 marine 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:25.750
 if you have a thermometer it's up to you to reach 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:27.760
 60 degrees if not he has only one 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:33.820
 The temperature he has is warmer. 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:35.980
 warm but not hot by the plane is 

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:40.120
 How can I help lead to the mixer? 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:43.230
 and beats at maximum speed to the sea ​​and 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:47.380
 build at room temperature 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:49.890
 This is what I'm going to use in the next one. 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:49.890
 episode 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:53.650

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:02.830
 the Italian husband is considered neither more 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:05.680
 everyone is stable and he is the 

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:07.150
 cause of the sugar because of the syrup 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:09.220
 sugar that goes into it 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:11.050
 it is the safest and the only one that can 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:12.670
 be stored for a few hours 

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:14.530
 before using 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:16.690
 start making a sugar syrup in 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:20.380
 bullet point which is more or less

 cup of water hits the whites in snow only 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:28.650
 which at a softer point increases the 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:31.120
 speed and add tail threaded 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:33.700
 slowly when he is in 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:35.769
 room temperature is because it's ready
