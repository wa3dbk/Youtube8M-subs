 [Music] 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:08.549
 [Laughs] 

00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:08.549
 [Music] 

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:15.549
 the threat of making the Aztec stadium 

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:16.740
 Emerald territory could not go more in 

00:00:15.549 --> 00:00:19.960

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.789
 dale dale dale dale 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:23.289
 dozens of trucks from 

00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:24.150
 lions came to the colossus of santa 

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:28.730

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.730
 [Music] 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.100
 I would like to enjoy it singing in 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.100
 the america room 

00:00:37.899 --> 00:00:42.500
 and of course reminders 

00:00:40.909 --> 00:00:45.729
 family and greetings to old acquaintances 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:45.729
 they could not miss 

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:53.009
 today I will have 

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:53.009
 [Applause] 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.620
 [Applause] 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:02.149
 in the middle of this emerald vortex were 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:03.890
 few Americanists that before the 

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:06.440
 threat of the stone trusted that 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:08.420
 the eagles could take the caste the 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:12.440
 ion you saw the caricature of 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:14.750
 walking the one that talks about lions and fearful 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:17.390
 if they know it more or less is what is going to 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:18.950
 come lamberto 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:20.270
 half an hour before the start 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:21.590
 encounter in the lionesses trucks 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:23.930
 they kept coming to the Aztecs to 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:25.730
 try to make yourself feel with everything and that 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:29.200
 on some of these buses too 

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:29.200
 appeared the odd yellow shirt 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:35.550
 already inside the stadium the americanistas 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.500
 began to feel visitors due 

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:39.210
 the large number of lion fans 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.760
 they did not stop cheering their players 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.560
 that for a few minutes they got the 

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:47.779
 illusion of winning the eagles 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.779
 [Music] 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:51.680
 in the dream of these thousands I end up with 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:54.140
 the reaction of some eagles that 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:55.870
 contrary to other occasions they found 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:59.589
 the goals at the right moment 

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:59.589
 [Music] 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:09.420
 with all the defeat the lion's liking 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:11.520
 recognized on his team and the team did not 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:14.390
 had more to thank for the support and 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:17.590
 promise that they will have better evenings 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:17.590
