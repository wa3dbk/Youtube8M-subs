funny smell to it and it's for a fast
track<00:00:47.520> making<00:00:48.120> bread<00:00:48.329> then<00:00:49.020> we<00:00:49.230> got<00:00:49.440> another

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
track making bread then we got another

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.240 
track making bread then we got another
kind<00:00:50.280> of<00:00:50.399> yeast<00:00:50.670> that's<00:00:51.059> called<00:00:51.360> the<00:00:51.510> freshest

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:52.250 
kind of yeast that's called the freshest

kind of yeast that's called the freshest
this<00:00:53.250> yeast<00:00:53.660> is<00:00:54.660> you<00:00:55.500> got<00:00:55.649> to<00:00:55.739> be<00:00:55.800> very

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
this yeast is you got to be very

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.250 
this yeast is you got to be very
cautious<00:00:56.399> to<00:00:56.789> work<00:00:56.969> with<00:00:57.180> it<00:00:57.300> it<00:00:57.750> has<00:00:58.020> to<00:00:58.199> be

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
cautious to work with it it has to be

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.410 
cautious to work with it it has to be
refrigerated<00:00:58.699> if<00:00:59.699> you<00:00:59.820> want<00:01:00.000> to<00:01:00.059> keep<00:01:00.180> it<00:01:00.359> for

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
refrigerated if you want to keep it for

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:01.700 
refrigerated if you want to keep it for
a<00:01:00.510> long<00:01:00.660> period<00:01:00.780> of<00:01:00.930> time<00:01:01.020> it<00:01:01.289> has<00:01:01.440> to<00:01:01.590> be

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
a long period of time it has to be

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.679 
a long period of time it has to be
frozen<00:01:02.010> and<00:01:03.530> it<00:01:04.530> could<00:01:04.860> be<00:01:05.210> extremely<00:01:06.210> toxic

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
frozen and it could be extremely toxic

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:09.620 
frozen and it could be extremely toxic
very<00:01:07.409> fast<00:01:07.740> so<00:01:08.220> if<00:01:08.790> you<00:01:08.909> ever<00:01:09.000> use<00:01:09.119> this<00:01:09.450> at

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
very fast so if you ever use this at

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.440 
very fast so if you ever use this at
home<00:01:09.869> you<00:01:09.900> got<00:01:10.229> to<00:01:10.320> be<00:01:10.409> very<00:01:10.439> careful<00:01:11.420> how<00:01:12.420> you

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
home you got to be very careful how you

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.649 
home you got to be very careful how you
manage<00:01:13.110> this<00:01:13.189> bad<00:01:14.189> these<00:01:14.520> Iran<00:01:15.119> years<00:01:15.420> could

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
manage this bad these Iran years could

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.590 
manage this bad these Iran years could
really<00:01:15.930> get<00:01:16.049> you<00:01:16.229> sick<00:01:16.500> and<00:01:16.820> this<00:01:17.820> is<00:01:18.030> a<00:01:18.060> what

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
really get you sick and this is a what

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.219 
really get you sick and this is a what
you<00:01:18.750> call<00:01:18.960> a<00:01:19.259> natural<00:01:20.189> wrist<00:01:20.490> and<00:01:20.900> that<00:01:21.900> this

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
you call a natural wrist and that this

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:23.420 
you call a natural wrist and that this
is<00:01:22.409> a<00:01:22.439> little<00:01:22.619> bit<00:01:22.770> harder<00:01:23.040> to<00:01:23.189> work<00:01:23.369> with

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
is a little bit harder to work with

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.340 
is a little bit harder to work with
because<00:01:24.180> this<00:01:24.570> is<00:01:24.720> recommended<00:01:25.020> to<00:01:25.259> be

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
because this is recommended to be

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.679 
because this is recommended to be
dissolved<00:01:25.950> in<00:01:26.040> warm<00:01:26.280> water<00:01:26.549> with<00:01:27.299> just<00:01:27.600> a

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
dissolved in warm water with just a

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.780 
dissolved in warm water with just a
pinch<00:01:27.930> of<00:01:28.110> sugar<00:01:28.170> at<00:01:28.799> times<00:01:29.100> if<00:01:29.280> you<00:01:29.310> want<00:01:29.610> to

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
pinch of sugar at times if you want to

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.569 
pinch of sugar at times if you want to
or<00:01:29.970> and<00:01:30.600> dissolve<00:01:31.140> it<00:01:31.320> so<00:01:31.470> it'll<00:01:31.619> get<00:01:31.829> all<00:01:31.979> over

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
or and dissolve it so it'll get all over

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.640 
or and dissolve it so it'll get all over
the<00:01:32.700> door<00:01:32.909> rather<00:01:33.150> than<00:01:33.299> just<00:01:34.110> part<00:01:34.470> of<00:01:34.590> the

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
the door rather than just part of the

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.460 
the door rather than just part of the
dough<00:01:34.920> so<00:01:35.790> this<00:01:36.060> is<00:01:36.180> a<00:01:36.240> more<00:01:36.420> authentic<00:01:36.659> yeast

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
dough so this is a more authentic yeast

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:42.230 
dough so this is a more authentic yeast
for<00:01:38.220> breads<00:01:38.520> such<00:01:38.850> as<00:01:39.090> a<00:01:40.250> baguette<00:01:41.250> or<00:01:41.520> the

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
for breads such as a baguette or the

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.510 
for breads such as a baguette or the
ciabatta<00:01:42.630> that<00:01:42.960> I<00:01:42.990> mentioned<00:01:43.320> or<00:01:43.770> breads<00:01:44.399> that

ship addresses for 18 hours long time
you<00:01:49.860> want<00:01:50.040> to<00:01:50.100> use<00:01:50.280> the<00:01:51.020> slower<00:01:52.020> pace<00:01:52.680> yeast

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
you want to use the slower pace yeast

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.359 
you want to use the slower pace yeast
which<00:01:53.610> is<00:01:53.759> the<00:01:53.850> natural<00:01:54.060> yeast<00:01:54.630> and<00:01:55.369> sometimes

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
which is the natural yeast and sometimes

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.700 
which is the natural yeast and sometimes
they<00:01:56.460> call<00:01:56.640> the<00:01:56.850> wettest<00:01:57.270> and<00:01:57.479> that<00:01:58.110> sits<00:01:58.530> in

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
they call the wettest and that sits in

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.399 
they call the wettest and that sits in
there<00:01:58.920> and<00:01:59.100> slowly<00:01:59.520> works<00:01:59.969> its<00:02:00.180> way<00:02:00.329> and<00:02:00.750> your

there and slowly works its way and your

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.859 
there and slowly works its way and your
bread<00:02:01.680> gets<00:02:01.920> an<00:02:02.040> extremely<00:02:02.790> delicious<00:02:03.180> flavor
