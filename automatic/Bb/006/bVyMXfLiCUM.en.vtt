the<00:00:21.119> double<00:00:21.810> in<00:00:21.960> this<00:00:22.350> game<00:00:22.609> unfortunately<00:00:23.609> I

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
the double in this game unfortunately I

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:24.890 
the double in this game unfortunately I
don't<00:00:24.000> show<00:00:24.180> that<00:00:24.210> street<00:00:24.600> because<00:00:24.779> that

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
don't show that street because that

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:25.700 
don't show that street because that
would<00:00:24.990> kind<00:00:25.109> of<00:00:25.140> make<00:00:25.230> the<00:00:25.320> video<00:00:25.500> too<00:00:25.590> long

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
would kind of make the video too long

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.620 
would kind of make the video too long
but<00:00:26.160> that<00:00:26.609> kind<00:00:26.789> of<00:00:26.820> sucks<00:00:27.090> but<00:00:27.210> still<00:00:27.449> you

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
but that kind of sucks but still you

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.330 
but that kind of sucks but still you
know<00:00:27.750> we<00:00:27.869> got<00:00:27.990> the<00:00:28.080> DNA<00:00:28.230> so<00:00:28.439> we<00:00:28.830> are<00:00:29.160> getting

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
know we got the DNA so we are getting

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:30.919 
know we got the DNA so we are getting
closer<00:00:29.699> and<00:00:29.849> closer<00:00:30.269> to<00:00:30.390> finishing<00:00:30.689> the

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
closer and closer to finishing the

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:32.749 
closer and closer to finishing the
series<00:00:31.260> I<00:00:31.349> believe<00:00:31.650> the<00:00:31.859> only<00:00:32.040> thing<00:00:32.520> we<00:00:32.640> have

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
series I believe the only thing we have

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.139 
series I believe the only thing we have
left<00:00:32.790> is<00:00:33.300> the<00:00:33.989> ohm<00:00:34.260> and<00:00:34.559> the<00:00:35.010> mp4<00:00:35.610> for<00:00:35.790> groc

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
left is the ohm and the mp4 for groc

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:38.240 
left is the ohm and the mp4 for groc
which<00:00:36.989> I<00:00:37.170> do<00:00:37.230> have<00:00:37.500> the<00:00:37.590> oh<00:00:37.620> my<00:00:37.920> just<00:00:38.010> have<00:00:38.190> to

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
which I do have the oh my just have to

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:39.709 
which I do have the oh my just have to
upload<00:00:38.460> it<00:00:38.640> actually<00:00:38.969> do<00:00:39.090> not<00:00:39.180> have<00:00:39.390> the<00:00:39.480> groc

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
upload it actually do not have the groc

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:40.940 
upload it actually do not have the groc
so<00:00:39.930> I<00:00:39.989> have<00:00:40.079> to<00:00:40.170> kind<00:00:40.410> of<00:00:40.440> get<00:00:40.559> on<00:00:40.680> advanced

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
so I have to kind of get on advanced

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:42.110 
so I have to kind of get on advanced
warfare<00:00:41.309> and<00:00:41.430> play<00:00:41.579> it<00:00:41.670> I<00:00:41.760> haven't<00:00:41.969> played

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
advanced warfare in such a long time

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:46.040

hardcore<00:01:01.500> we're<00:01:01.710> like<00:01:01.890> levels<00:01:02.190> the<00:01:02.309> playing

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
hardcore we're like levels the playing

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.729 
hardcore we're like levels the playing
field<00:01:02.609> and<00:01:02.940> the<00:01:03.840> thing<00:01:04.019> about<00:01:04.049> the<00:01:04.290> Atlas<00:01:04.589> is

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
field and the thing about the Atlas is

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.130 
field and the thing about the Atlas is
that<00:01:04.860> it's<00:01:04.979> just<00:01:05.189> too<00:01:05.489> weak<00:01:06.150> it<00:01:06.750> doesn't<00:01:07.080> have

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
that it's just too weak it doesn't have

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:08.600 
that it's just too weak it doesn't have
that<00:01:07.320> punching<00:01:07.799> power<00:01:07.950> it<00:01:08.250> doesn't<00:01:08.490> really

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
that punching power it doesn't really

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.219 
that punching power it doesn't really
have<00:01:08.760> a<00:01:08.790> lot<00:01:08.909> of<00:01:08.970> ammo<00:01:09.360> and<00:01:09.540> you<00:01:09.960> will<00:01:10.110> be

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
have a lot of ammo and you will be

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:11.630 
have a lot of ammo and you will be
screwed<00:01:10.619> if<00:01:10.770> you<00:01:10.860> run<00:01:10.979> into<00:01:11.010> more<00:01:11.400> than<00:01:11.610> one

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
screwed if you run into more than one

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.670 
screwed if you run into more than one
person<00:01:12.119> at<00:01:12.330> a<00:01:12.390> time<00:01:12.479> with<00:01:12.780> it<00:01:12.900> but<00:01:13.439> you<00:01:13.470> know

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
person at a time with it but you know

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.469 
person at a time with it but you know
it's<00:01:14.070> definitely<00:01:14.310> not<00:01:14.700> one<00:01:15.180> of<00:01:15.210> the<00:01:15.330> better

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
it's definitely not one of the better

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.570 
it's definitely not one of the better
secondaries<00:01:16.110> I'd<00:01:16.229> put<00:01:16.409> it<00:01:16.439> probably<00:01:16.920> I<00:01:17.100> think

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
secondaries I'd put it probably I think

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:18.859 
secondaries I'd put it probably I think
it's<00:01:17.670> a<00:01:17.759> little<00:01:17.850> bit<00:01:17.970> better<00:01:18.150> than<00:01:18.390> the<00:01:18.509> groc<00:01:18.720> I

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
it's a little bit better than the groc I

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:20.929 
it's a little bit better than the groc I
think<00:01:19.020> the<00:01:19.110> groc<00:01:19.290> is<00:01:19.439> the<00:01:19.530> worst<00:01:19.710> one<00:01:19.950> overall

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
think the groc is the worst one overall

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:23.149 
think the groc is the worst one overall
but<00:01:21.210> you<00:01:22.049> know<00:01:22.170> that<00:01:22.320> just<00:01:22.530> still<00:01:22.710> puts<00:01:22.950> it<00:01:23.070> at

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
but you know that just still puts it at

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:24.950 
but you know that just still puts it at
the<00:01:23.310> third<00:01:23.520> place<00:01:23.820> spot<00:01:24.090> so<00:01:24.390> I<00:01:24.570> wouldn't

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
the third place spot so I wouldn't

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.450 
the third place spot so I wouldn't
really<00:01:25.049> recommend<00:01:25.140> using<00:01:25.680> it<00:01:25.920> you<00:01:26.009> can<00:01:26.220> if<00:01:26.369> you

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
really recommend using it you can if you

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.640 
really recommend using it you can if you
want<00:01:26.580> to<00:01:26.850> but<00:01:27.060> it's<00:01:27.570> not<00:01:27.840> really<00:01:28.290> worth<00:01:28.470> your

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
want to but it's not really worth your

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.410 
want to but it's not really worth your
time<00:01:28.799> and<00:01:29.070> I<00:01:29.460> don't<00:01:29.520> usually<00:01:29.850> say<00:01:30.210> it<00:01:30.329> out

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
time and I don't usually say it out

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.480 
time and I don't usually say it out
about<00:01:30.630> guns<00:01:30.900> but<00:01:31.229> it's<00:01:31.380> just<00:01:31.619> not<00:01:31.680> it's<00:01:32.070> not

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
about guns but it's just not it's not

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:33.950 
about guns but it's just not it's not
really<00:01:32.759> fun<00:01:33.030> to<00:01:33.150> use<00:01:33.329> and<00:01:33.360> if<00:01:33.570> there's<00:01:33.720> no<00:01:33.810> real

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
really fun to use and if there's no real

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.899 
really fun to use and if there's no real
point<00:01:34.170> to<00:01:34.439> it<00:01:34.560> but<00:01:35.009> that's<00:01:35.369> a<00:01:35.520> little<00:01:35.790> bit

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
what I've realized from kind of seeing

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:16.970 
what I've realized from kind of seeing
Twitter<00:02:15.750> and<00:02:15.989> like<00:02:16.140> everyone<00:02:16.409> a<00:02:16.560> Twitter<00:02:16.799> on

Twitter and like everyone a Twitter on

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:17.899 
Twitter and like everyone a Twitter on
Twitter<00:02:17.010> was<00:02:17.370> really<00:02:17.549> mad<00:02:17.700> because

00:02:17.899 --> 00:02:17.909 
Twitter was really mad because

00:02:17.909 --> 00:02:20.149 
Twitter was really mad because
Mayweather<00:02:18.180> did<00:02:18.480> end<00:02:18.780> up<00:02:18.900> winning<00:02:19.110> and<00:02:19.349> I

00:02:20.149 --> 00:02:20.159 
Mayweather did end up winning and I

00:02:20.159 --> 00:02:21.170 
Mayweather did end up winning and I
don't<00:02:20.459> think<00:02:20.610> people<00:02:20.730> really<00:02:20.970> like

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
don't think people really like

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:22.369 
don't think people really like
Mayweather<00:02:21.390> you<00:02:21.689> know<00:02:21.780> there's<00:02:21.930> some<00:02:22.079> who<00:02:22.200> do

00:02:22.369 --> 00:02:22.379 
Mayweather you know there's some who do

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:23.750 
Mayweather you know there's some who do
but<00:02:22.620> in<00:02:22.769> general<00:02:22.950> I<00:02:23.159> mean<00:02:23.310> he's<00:02:23.400> just<00:02:23.579> kind<00:02:23.730> of

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
but in general I mean he's just kind of

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.059 
but in general I mean he's just kind of
an<00:02:23.879> asshole<00:02:24.060> like<00:02:24.510> cocky<00:02:24.900> prick<00:02:25.140> in<00:02:25.530> the<00:02:25.920> eyes

00:02:26.059 --> 00:02:26.069 
an asshole like cocky prick in the eyes

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:28.069 
an asshole like cocky prick in the eyes
of<00:02:26.340> basically<00:02:26.909> the<00:02:27.090> general<00:02:27.450> American<00:02:27.569> public

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:28.079 
of basically the general American public

00:02:28.079 --> 00:02:29.690 
of basically the general American public
so<00:02:28.290> I<00:02:28.500> don't<00:02:29.010> think<00:02:29.069> that<00:02:29.159> many<00:02:29.280> people<00:02:29.400> like

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
so I don't think that many people like

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:30.530 
so I don't think that many people like
him<00:02:29.849> I<00:02:29.879> think<00:02:30.000> a<00:02:30.150> lot<00:02:30.180> of<00:02:30.299> people<00:02:30.360> really

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
him I think a lot of people really

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.149 
him I think a lot of people really
wanted<00:02:30.930> to<00:02:31.049> pack<00:02:31.349> out<00:02:31.560> a<00:02:31.590> win<00:02:31.799> and<00:02:31.980> it<00:02:32.129> was

00:02:32.149 --> 00:02:32.159 
wanted to pack out a win and it was

00:02:32.159 --> 00:02:35.059 
wanted to pack out a win and it was
close<00:02:32.909> as<00:02:33.269> far<00:02:34.200> as<00:02:34.230> I<00:02:34.349> could<00:02:34.409> tell<00:02:34.560> i<00:02:34.739> mean<00:02:34.980> the

00:02:35.059 --> 00:02:35.069 
close as far as I could tell i mean the

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:36.559 
close as far as I could tell i mean the
scores<00:02:35.430> were<00:02:35.519> relatively<00:02:36.000> close<00:02:36.299> to<00:02:36.450> the

00:02:36.559 --> 00:02:36.569 
scores were relatively close to the

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:38.180 
scores were relatively close to the
punch<00:02:36.840> is<00:02:37.019> thrown<00:02:37.049> and<00:02:37.470> like<00:02:37.590> the<00:02:37.709> statistics

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
punch is thrown and like the statistics

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
know Mayweather it was just kind of

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:58.970 
know Mayweather it was just kind of
dodging<00:02:57.840> all<00:02:57.959> the<00:02:58.049> packing<00:02:58.379> else<00:02:58.470> punches<00:02:58.799> and

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
dodging all the packing else punches and

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:00.349 
dodging all the packing else punches and

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:00.359 
you know running away from him the

00:03:00.359 --> 00:03:02.660 
you know running away from him the
entire<00:03:00.480> time<00:03:00.659> which<00:03:01.109> is<00:03:01.349> his<00:03:01.950> style<00:03:02.459> of

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
entire time which is his style of

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:03.920 
entire time which is his style of
fighting<00:03:02.879> you<00:03:03.180> know<00:03:03.209> I<00:03:03.329> guess<00:03:03.720> apparently

fighting you know I guess apparently

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:06.349

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:07.709 
but it doesn't really make for that
