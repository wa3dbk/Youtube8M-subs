00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
so we're actually gonna test this out

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.649 
so we're actually gonna test this out
normally<00:01:43.799> I<00:01:43.829> even<00:01:44.310> though<00:01:44.430> I'm<00:01:45.119> always<00:01:45.360> using

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
normally I even though I'm always using

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.870 
normally I even though I'm always using
this<00:01:45.899> I<00:01:46.110> do<00:01:46.500> go<00:01:46.740> in<00:01:46.920> there<00:01:47.070> and<00:01:47.159> clean<00:01:47.310> it<00:01:47.369> but

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
this I do go in there and clean it but

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.670 
this I do go in there and clean it but
you<00:01:48.000> know<00:01:48.119> what<00:01:48.360> we're<00:01:49.049> gonna<00:01:49.170> help<00:01:49.409> see<00:01:49.560> if<00:01:49.590> we

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
you know what we're gonna help see if we

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:50.719 
you know what we're gonna help see if we
can<00:01:49.829> hold<00:01:50.009> them<00:01:50.130> to<00:01:50.280> it<00:01:50.310> and<00:01:50.399> see<00:01:50.579> if<00:01:50.640> it

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
can hold them to it and see if it

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.280 
can hold them to it and see if it
actually<00:01:50.759> does<00:01:51.119> it<00:01:51.240> now<00:01:51.329> it<00:01:51.450> does<00:01:51.630> say<00:01:51.869> if<00:01:52.140> you

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
actually does it now it does say if you

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.859 
actually does it now it does say if you
might<00:01:52.470> need<00:01:52.590> to<00:01:52.710> do<00:01:52.860> it<00:01:52.979> scrub<00:01:53.340> the<00:01:53.869> second

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
might need to do it scrub the second

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.120 
might need to do it scrub the second
application<00:01:54.960> or<00:01:55.350> scrubbing<00:01:55.710> might<00:01:55.950> be

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
application or scrubbing might be

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.340 
application or scrubbing might be
necessary<00:01:56.369> I<00:01:56.670> think<00:01:56.939> that's<00:01:57.090> their<00:01:57.360> quick<00:01:58.170> out

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
necessary I think that's their quick out

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:59.719 
necessary I think that's their quick out
for<00:01:58.710> a<00:01:58.740> lot<00:01:58.920> of<00:01:59.070> companies<00:01:59.369> because<00:01:59.640> I've

00:03:58.560 --> 00:03:58.570 
but like it says if it's bad you're

00:03:58.570 --> 00:03:59.760 
but like it says if it's bad you're
gonna<00:03:58.660> have<00:03:58.780> to<00:03:58.840> go<00:03:58.900> and<00:03:59.050> scrub<00:03:59.290> and<00:03:59.500> I<00:03:59.530> think

that's<00:03:59.950> the<00:04:00.100> way<00:04:00.220> a<00:04:00.250> lot<00:04:00.400> of<00:04:00.459> these<00:04:00.670> companies

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:00.910 
that's the way a lot of these companies

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:03.300 
that's the way a lot of these companies
are<00:04:01.590> because<00:04:02.590> people<00:04:02.830> would<00:04:02.950> complain<00:04:03.040> and

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:03.310 
are because people would complain and

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:05.550 
are because people would complain and
say<00:04:03.430> well<00:04:03.610> it's<00:04:03.730> not<00:04:03.790> really<00:04:04.030> spray<00:04:04.390> off<00:04:04.570> so<00:04:05.140> I
