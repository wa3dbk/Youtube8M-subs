00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:59.410 
Alberta beats sfu 2816 I mean we just
came<00:01:57.799> out<00:01:57.979> kind<00:01:58.219> of<00:01:58.280> flat<00:01:58.549> I<00:01:58.820> mean<00:01:59.000> we<00:01:59.210> thought

00:01:59.410 --> 00:01:59.420 
came out kind of flat I mean we thought

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:00.520 
came out kind of flat I mean we thought
that<00:01:59.600> you<00:01:59.719> know<00:01:59.869> we<00:02:00.049> should<00:02:00.079> have<00:02:00.289> won<00:02:00.409> the

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:00.530 
that you know we should have won the

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:03.010 
that you know we should have won the
game<00:02:00.560> before<00:02:00.859> it<00:02:01.070> even<00:02:01.159> started<00:02:01.670> and<00:02:02.020> second

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:03.020 
game before it even started and second

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:04.830 
game before it even started and second
half<00:02:03.229> I<00:02:03.409> thought<00:02:03.619> we<00:02:03.740> came<00:02:03.920> up<00:02:04.100> pretty<00:02:04.250> good

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:04.840 
half I thought we came up pretty good

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.450 
half I thought we came up pretty good
but<00:02:05.840> you<00:02:06.049> know<00:02:06.229> they<00:02:06.439> kept<00:02:06.950> playing<00:02:07.159> strong

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:07.460 
but you know they kept playing strong

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:09.760 
but you know they kept playing strong
and<00:02:07.700> we<00:02:07.789> couldn't<00:02:08.060> keep<00:02:08.149> up<00:02:08.390> so<00:02:08.420> I<00:02:08.630> mean<00:02:08.899> we

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:09.770 
and we couldn't keep up so I mean we

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:10.930 
and we couldn't keep up so I mean we
felt<00:02:09.979> like<00:02:10.039> we<00:02:10.220> could<00:02:10.340> have<00:02:10.460> beat<00:02:10.610> them<00:02:10.729> but<00:02:10.850> we

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:10.940 
felt like we could have beat them but we

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:12.430 
felt like we could have beat them but we
just<00:02:11.060> came<00:02:11.210> out<00:02:11.390> really<00:02:11.510> flat<00:02:11.900> we<00:02:12.320> have<00:02:12.410> a

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:12.440 
just came out really flat we have a

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:13.720 
just came out really flat we have a
great<00:02:12.620> team<00:02:12.680> and<00:02:13.040> we<00:02:13.129> just<00:02:13.310> haven't<00:02:13.519> shown<00:02:13.700> it

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:13.730
