the center fire fire tube I have a
six-inch<00:00:32.579> heating<00:00:33.360> cooling<00:00:33.540> duct<00:00:34.340> hung<00:00:35.340> down

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
six-inch heating cooling duct hung down

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.130 
six-inch heating cooling duct hung down
in<00:00:35.760> there<00:00:35.969> and<00:00:36.180> I<00:00:36.270> don't<00:00:36.329> know<00:00:36.690> if<00:00:36.780> you<00:00:36.870> can<00:00:36.960> see

probably not okay price you a little bit

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:42.680 
probably not okay price you a little bit
of<00:00:42.030> wood<00:00:42.239> down<00:00:42.450> there

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
of wood down there

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.049 
of wood down there
anyways<00:00:43.440> that<00:00:44.190> goes<00:00:44.370> all<00:00:44.550> the<00:00:44.579> way<00:00:44.670> down<00:00:44.730> to

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
anyways that goes all the way down to

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.410 
anyways that goes all the way down to
the<00:00:45.149> bottom<00:00:45.300> and<00:00:45.840> there<00:00:46.110> is<00:00:46.260> a<00:00:46.460> rain<00:00:47.460> cap<00:00:47.820> that

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
the bottom and there is a rain cap that

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.709 
the bottom and there is a rain cap that
usually<00:00:48.809> goes<00:00:48.989> on<00:00:49.170> top<00:00:49.379> of<00:00:50.180> you<00:00:51.180> know<00:00:51.300> exhaust

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
usually goes on top of you know exhaust

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.900 
usually goes on top of you know exhaust
vents<00:00:52.170> on<00:00:52.289> top<00:00:52.590> of<00:00:52.770> roofs<00:00:52.980> and<00:00:53.250> I've<00:00:53.370> I've

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
vents on top of roofs and I've I've

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.760 
vents on top of roofs and I've I've
flipped<00:00:54.539> that<00:00:54.719> upside<00:00:55.079> down<00:00:55.110> and<00:00:55.440> drilled<00:00:55.649> my

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
flipped that upside down and drilled my

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.549 
flipped that upside down and drilled my
holes<00:00:56.010> in<00:00:56.190> it<00:00:56.309> so<00:00:56.460> that's<00:00:56.610> where<00:00:56.969> my<00:00:57.420> wood<00:00:57.989> sits

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
holes in it so that's where my wood sits

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:02.569 
holes in it so that's where my wood sits
and<00:00:58.800> works<00:00:58.980> molders<00:01:00.079> so<00:01:01.079> I'm<00:01:01.199> thinking<00:01:01.649> this

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
and works molders so I'm thinking this

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.600 
and works molders so I'm thinking this
may<00:01:02.820> be<00:01:02.879> one<00:01:03.149> of<00:01:03.180> the<00:01:03.300> downfalls<00:01:03.830> of<00:01:04.830> my

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
may be one of the downfalls of my

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.260 
may be one of the downfalls of my
gasification<00:01:06.360> system<00:01:06.390> that<00:01:07.100> that<00:01:08.100> my<00:01:08.280> fire

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
gasification system that that my fire

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.920 
gasification system that that my fire
shoot<00:01:09.600> or<00:01:10.110> my<00:01:10.549> fire<00:01:11.549> column<00:01:11.939> is<00:01:12.060> too<00:01:12.450> big<00:01:12.689> and

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
shoot or my fire column is too big and

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.480 
shoot or my fire column is too big and
it's<00:01:13.020> letting<00:01:13.290> too<00:01:13.409> much<00:01:13.560> oxygen<00:01:13.770> in<00:01:14.189> but<00:01:14.369> will

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
it's letting too much oxygen in but will

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.210 
it's letting too much oxygen in but will
good<00:01:14.700> get<00:01:15.240> to<00:01:15.360> that<00:01:15.479> more<00:01:15.689> later<00:01:15.869> so<00:01:16.220> from

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
good get to that more later so from

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.800 
good get to that more later so from
there<00:01:17.509> it<00:01:18.890> burns<00:01:19.890> down<00:01:20.159> in<00:01:20.340> the<00:01:20.430> bottom<00:01:20.790> i<00:01:21.030> lied

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
there it burns down in the bottom i lied

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.929 
there it burns down in the bottom i lied
it<00:01:21.990> by<00:01:22.200> this<00:01:24.439> little<00:01:25.439> lighting<00:01:26.070> port<00:01:26.340> little

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
it by this little lighting port little

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:28.819 
it by this little lighting port little
hole<00:01:27.150> that<00:01:27.330> I<00:01:27.420> made<00:01:28.049> down<00:01:28.259> here<00:01:28.560> and<00:01:28.710> this<00:01:28.770> is

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
hole that I made down here and this is

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.760 
hole that I made down here and this is
just<00:01:29.009> a<00:01:29.369> short<00:01:30.299> little<00:01:30.509> connector<00:01:31.320> piece<00:01:31.560> for

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
just a short little connector piece for

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.090 
just a short little connector piece for
6-inch<00:01:32.479> heating<00:01:33.479> cooling<00:01:33.630> and<00:01:33.930> I<00:01:34.049> cut<00:01:34.920> out<00:01:34.950> a

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
6-inch heating cooling and I cut out a

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.080 
6-inch heating cooling and I cut out a
circle<00:01:35.369> and<00:01:35.909> I've<00:01:37.130> poor-man's<00:01:38.130> welded<00:01:38.549> it<00:01:38.700> JB

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
circle and I've poor-man's welded it JB

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.429 
circle and I've poor-man's welded it JB
welded<00:01:39.390> it<00:01:39.509> since<00:01:39.689> I<00:01:39.810> don't<00:01:39.990> have<00:01:40.110> a<00:01:40.140> welder

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
welded it since I don't have a welder

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:43.700 
welded it since I don't have a welder
and<00:01:40.470> don't<00:01:40.710> know<00:01:40.770> how<00:01:40.860> to<00:01:40.950> weld<00:01:42.470> so<00:01:43.470> I<00:01:43.500> don't

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
and don't know how to weld so I don't

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:44.960 
and don't know how to weld so I don't
know<00:01:43.829> if<00:01:43.920> you<00:01:43.979> can<00:01:44.100> see<00:01:44.310> down<00:01:44.490> into<00:01:44.759> there

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
know if you can see down into there

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.149 
know if you can see down into there
probably<00:01:45.420> not<00:01:45.600> but<00:01:46.560> that's<00:01:46.710> kind<00:01:46.950> of<00:01:47.009> where

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
probably not but that's kind of where

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:50.749 
probably not but that's kind of where
the<00:01:47.899> where<00:01:48.899> that<00:01:48.930> rain<00:01:49.350> cap<00:01:49.649> is<00:01:49.920> where<00:01:50.250> the

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
the where that rain cap is where the

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:52.730 
the where that rain cap is where the
where<00:01:51.540> I<00:01:51.570> like<00:01:51.780> the<00:01:51.930> wood<00:01:52.110> and<00:01:52.290> where<00:01:52.470> it<00:01:52.560> sits

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
where I like the wood and where it sits

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.730 
where I like the wood and where it sits
there<00:01:52.920> and<00:01:53.040> smolders<00:01:53.460> and<00:01:54.119> I've<00:01:54.270> also<00:01:54.710> cut<00:01:55.710> out

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
there and smolders and I've also cut out

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.940 
there and smolders and I've also cut out
a<00:01:55.890> little<00:01:56.070> hole<00:01:56.340> here<00:01:56.700> and<00:01:57.290> ran<00:01:58.290> a<00:01:58.320> piece<00:01:58.740> of

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
a little hole here and ran a piece of

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.520 
a little hole here and ran a piece of
piece<00:01:59.700> of<00:01:59.729> steel<00:02:00.450> that<00:02:00.509> goes<00:02:00.840> in<00:02:01.020> there<00:02:01.200> little

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
piece of steel that goes in there little

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.459 
piece of steel that goes in there little
flat<00:02:01.829> piece<00:02:02.210> that's<00:02:03.210> my<00:02:03.570> shaker<00:02:03.869> it<00:02:04.140> just<00:02:04.320> fits

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
flat piece that's my shaker it just fits

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:06.459 
flat piece that's my shaker it just fits
the<00:02:04.619> bottom<00:02:04.950> of<00:02:05.130> that<00:02:05.250> little<00:02:05.490> rain<00:02:05.820> cap<00:02:06.090> vent

00:02:06.459 --> 00:02:06.469 
the bottom of that little rain cap vent

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:10.190 
the bottom of that little rain cap vent
and<00:02:07.469> it<00:02:07.590> knocks<00:02:07.799> the<00:02:07.979> ash<00:02:08.129> down<00:02:08.840> for<00:02:09.840> my<00:02:09.959> I

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
and it knocks the ash down for my I

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.210 
and it knocks the ash down for my I
guess<00:02:10.410> would<00:02:10.530> be<00:02:10.619> the<00:02:10.739> sifter

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.220 
guess would be the sifter

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:14.850 
guess would be the sifter
so<00:02:12.310> I<00:02:12.340> do<00:02:12.430> have<00:02:12.700> a<00:02:12.760> cap<00:02:13.000> for<00:02:13.270> that<00:02:13.330> obviously<00:02:13.960> to

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:14.860 
so I do have a cap for that obviously to

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:18.900 
so I do have a cap for that obviously to
make<00:02:14.980> the<00:02:15.100> system<00:02:15.310> airtight<00:02:16.800> so<00:02:17.800> it's<00:02:18.490> not

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:18.910 
make the system airtight so it's not

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:20.730 
make the system airtight so it's not
very<00:02:19.180> airtight<00:02:19.660> but<00:02:19.870> it's<00:02:20.020> good<00:02:20.200> enough<00:02:20.410> for

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:20.740 
very airtight but it's good enough for

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:24.450 
very airtight but it's good enough for
the<00:02:21.160> situation<00:02:21.810> anyways<00:02:22.810> we<00:02:23.680> come<00:02:23.830> up<00:02:23.950> here<00:02:24.160> to

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:24.460 
the situation anyways we come up here to

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:28.140 
the situation anyways we come up here to
the<00:02:24.850> or<00:02:25.330> the<00:02:25.420> gas<00:02:25.570> exit<00:02:26.110> exits<00:02:27.010> this<00:02:27.820> is<00:02:27.970> just

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.150 
the or the gas exit exits this is just

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:31.470 
the or the gas exit exits this is just
three<00:02:28.450> inch<00:02:28.570> heating<00:02:28.870> cooling<00:02:29.940> so<00:02:30.940> that<00:02:31.210> goes

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.480 
three inch heating cooling so that goes

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:33.630 
three inch heating cooling so that goes
all<00:02:31.690> the<00:02:31.720> way<00:02:31.810> down<00:02:32.050> here<00:02:32.470> to<00:02:33.070> this<00:02:33.190> it's<00:02:33.520> about

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:33.640 
all the way down here to this it's about

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:37.260 
all the way down here to this it's about
a<00:02:33.760> six<00:02:34.120> six<00:02:34.900> foot<00:02:35.140> five<00:02:35.920> foot<00:02:36.250> portion<00:02:36.760> I've

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:37.270 
a six six foot five foot portion I've

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:39.240 
a six six foot five foot portion I've
got<00:02:37.390> some<00:02:37.570> elbows<00:02:37.930> down<00:02:38.140> there<00:02:38.410> and<00:02:39.160> then

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250 
got some elbows down there and then

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:41.160 
got some elbows down there and then
right<00:02:39.460> here<00:02:39.880> this<00:02:40.600> is<00:02:40.660> for<00:02:40.780> where<00:02:41.050> the

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:41.170 
right here this is for where the

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:42.630 
right here this is for where the
condensation<00:02:41.680> builds<00:02:42.070> up<00:02:42.220> and<00:02:42.400> that<00:02:42.490> goes

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.640 
condensation builds up and that goes

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:45.510 
condensation builds up and that goes
down<00:02:42.820> into<00:02:43.060> the<00:02:43.300> into<00:02:43.960> this<00:02:44.110> little<00:02:44.400> tank<00:02:45.400> I

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:45.520 
down into the into this little tank I

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:48.060 
down into the into this little tank I
have<00:02:45.670> here<00:02:45.910> for<00:02:46.090> the<00:02:46.180> water<00:02:46.390> and<00:02:46.660> then<00:02:47.650> got

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:48.070 
have here for the water and then got

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:49.740 
have here for the water and then got
another<00:02:48.250> five<00:02:48.580> foot<00:02:48.820> six<00:02:49.000> foot<00:02:49.240> section<00:02:49.630> that

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:49.750 
another five foot six foot section that

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:52.740 
another five foot six foot section that
goes<00:02:49.900> over<00:02:50.140> to<00:02:50.200> the<00:02:50.290> filter<00:02:50.650> beds<00:02:51.570> this<00:02:52.570> is

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:52.750 
goes over to the filter beds this is

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:55.400 
goes over to the filter beds this is
just<00:02:53.020> a<00:02:53.440> little<00:02:54.310> five<00:02:54.550> gallon<00:02:54.850> paint<00:02:55.060> buckets

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410 
just a little five gallon paint buckets

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:58.260 
just a little five gallon paint buckets
they're<00:02:56.410> actually<00:02:56.770> icing<00:02:57.310> buckets<00:02:57.640> anyways

00:02:58.260 --> 00:02:58.270 
they're actually icing buckets anyways

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:02.100 
they're actually icing buckets anyways
it<00:02:58.720> goes<00:02:58.930> down<00:02:59.140> into<00:02:59.950> the<00:03:00.310> top<00:03:00.550> here<00:03:00.970> and<00:03:01.120> I<00:03:01.959> got

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:02.110 
it goes down into the top here and I got

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:05.070 
it goes down into the top here and I got
a<00:03:02.140> bed<00:03:02.410> of<00:03:02.680> pine<00:03:03.459> needles<00:03:03.880> for<00:03:04.090> about<00:03:04.270> 3/4<00:03:04.990> of

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:05.080 
a bed of pine needles for about 3/4 of

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:07.260 
a bed of pine needles for about 3/4 of
it<00:03:05.230> and<00:03:05.410> towards<00:03:06.220> the<00:03:06.370> lower<00:03:06.550> portion<00:03:06.970> of<00:03:07.060> it<00:03:07.180> I

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:07.270 
it and towards the lower portion of it I

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:10.410 
it and towards the lower portion of it I
have<00:03:07.390> pine<00:03:07.690> cones<00:03:08.700> so<00:03:09.700> I<00:03:09.730> don't<00:03:09.940> know<00:03:10.030> how<00:03:10.209> good

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:10.420 
have pine cones so I don't know how good

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:11.990 
have pine cones so I don't know how good
that's<00:03:10.630> going<00:03:10.750> to<00:03:10.810> do<00:03:10.959> it<00:03:11.050> filtering<00:03:11.500> it<00:03:11.620> but

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 
that's going to do it filtering it but

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.060 
that's going to do it filtering it but
anyways<00:03:13.080> that<00:03:14.080> goes<00:03:14.260> down<00:03:14.470> there's<00:03:14.740> actually

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:15.070 
anyways that goes down there's actually

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:17.070 
anyways that goes down there's actually
a<00:03:15.100> hole<00:03:15.340> in<00:03:15.550> the<00:03:15.640> center<00:03:16.000> of<00:03:16.180> the<00:03:16.600> bottom<00:03:16.780> of

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:17.080 
a hole in the center of the bottom of

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:18.960 
a hole in the center of the bottom of
this<00:03:17.170> bucket<00:03:17.440> in<00:03:17.769> the<00:03:17.890> top<00:03:18.130> of<00:03:18.400> this<00:03:18.580> bucket

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:18.970 
this bucket in the top of this bucket

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:20.900 
this bucket in the top of this bucket
and<00:03:19.300> I've<00:03:19.600> actually<00:03:20.080> glued<00:03:20.290> these<00:03:20.470> together

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:20.910 
and I've actually glued these together

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:23.490 
and I've actually glued these together
and<00:03:21.910> then<00:03:22.120> in<00:03:22.269> the<00:03:22.330> lower<00:03:22.540> portion<00:03:22.840> here<00:03:23.320> I

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:23.500 
and then in the lower portion here I

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:25.830 
and then in the lower portion here I
don't<00:03:24.250> know<00:03:24.370> I'll<00:03:24.820> probably<00:03:25.060> get<00:03:25.330> a<00:03:25.390> video<00:03:25.630> for

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:25.840 
don't know I'll probably get a video for

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:27.390 
don't know I'll probably get a video for
you<00:03:25.900> this<00:03:25.989> later<00:03:26.290> since<00:03:26.980> I<00:03:27.040> have<00:03:27.190> it<00:03:27.250> all

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:27.400 
you this later since I have it all

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:29.430 
you this later since I have it all
together<00:03:27.580> right<00:03:27.910> now<00:03:28.060> but<00:03:28.239> I<00:03:28.269> actually<00:03:29.080> have

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:29.440 
together right now but I actually have

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:32.090 
together right now but I actually have
an<00:03:29.620> automotive<00:03:30.010> air<00:03:30.970> filter<00:03:31.480> down<00:03:31.690> there

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:32.100 
an automotive air filter down there

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:37.259 
an automotive air filter down there
that's<00:03:33.510> attached<00:03:34.510> to<00:03:34.780> a<00:03:35.190> piece<00:03:36.190> of<00:03:36.370> PVC<00:03:36.580> piping

00:03:37.259 --> 00:03:37.269 
that's attached to a piece of PVC piping

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:38.699 
that's attached to a piece of PVC piping
to<00:03:37.390> straight<00:03:37.720> pipe<00:03:37.930> that<00:03:38.140> I<00:03:38.200> have<00:03:38.350> down<00:03:38.560> the

00:03:38.699 --> 00:03:38.709 
to straight pipe that I have down the

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:41.430 
to straight pipe that I have down the
center<00:03:39.180> so<00:03:40.180> the<00:03:40.510> only<00:03:40.630> thing<00:03:40.900> in<00:03:41.019> this<00:03:41.170> bucket

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:41.440 
center so the only thing in this bucket

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:43.650 
center so the only thing in this bucket
is<00:03:41.769> the<00:03:41.890> automotive<00:03:42.220> air<00:03:42.489> filter<00:03:42.880> and<00:03:43.060> it's<00:03:43.510> a

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:43.660 
is the automotive air filter and it's a

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:47.030 
is the automotive air filter and it's a
Ford<00:03:44.019> type<00:03:44.260> where<00:03:44.560> it<00:03:44.590> just<00:03:44.830> comes<00:03:45.070> in<00:03:45.220> one<00:03:45.400> end

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.040 
Ford type where it just comes in one end

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:49.259 
Ford type where it just comes in one end
one<00:03:48.040> end<00:03:48.190> is<00:03:48.340> open<00:03:48.640> and<00:03:48.790> that's<00:03:48.910> what's<00:03:49.150> on

00:03:49.259 --> 00:03:49.269 
one end is open and that's what's on

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:52.340 
one end is open and that's what's on
that<00:03:49.299> PVC<00:03:49.840> piping<00:03:50.230> so<00:03:50.680> that<00:03:51.310> goes<00:03:51.549> up<00:03:51.760> to<00:03:51.880> here

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:52.350 
that PVC piping so that goes up to here

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:55.110 
that PVC piping so that goes up to here
right<00:03:53.350> here<00:03:53.920> I<00:03:53.980> got<00:03:54.220> a<00:03:54.250> place<00:03:54.700> where<00:03:54.910> I<00:03:54.940> can

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:55.120 
right here I got a place where I can

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:56.490 
right here I got a place where I can
port<00:03:55.360> it<00:03:55.450> out<00:03:55.570> to<00:03:55.690> the<00:03:55.810> engines<00:03:56.170> of<00:03:56.320> when<00:03:56.470> I

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:56.500 
port it out to the engines of when I

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:58.229 
port it out to the engines of when I
eventually<00:03:56.769> get<00:03:57.100> the<00:03:57.250> producer<00:03:57.640> gas<00:03:57.760> going

00:03:58.229 --> 00:03:58.239 
eventually get the producer gas going

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:03.060 
eventually get the producer gas going
and<00:03:59.230> then<00:03:59.350> it<00:03:59.530> goes<00:03:59.680> up<00:03:59.709> to<00:03:59.980> this<00:04:02.070> builds

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:03.070 
and then it goes up to this builds

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:05.130 
and then it goes up to this builds
blower<00:04:03.280> pump<00:04:03.670> it's<00:04:04.060> just<00:04:04.360> a<00:04:04.480> 3-inch<00:04:04.840> builds

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:05.140 
blower pump it's just a 3-inch builds

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:07.949 
blower pump it's just a 3-inch builds
blower<00:04:05.350> pump<00:04:05.680> and<00:04:06.010> that's<00:04:06.489> ran<00:04:06.790> off<00:04:07.180> of<00:04:07.510> the

00:04:07.949 --> 00:04:07.959 
blower pump and that's ran off of the

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:10.229 
blower pump and that's ran off of the
car<00:04:08.650> battery<00:04:09.010> right<00:04:09.220> here<00:04:09.430> and<00:04:09.580> this<00:04:10.000> car

00:04:10.229 --> 00:04:10.239 
car battery right here and this car

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:12.449 
car battery right here and this car
battery<00:04:10.600> whenever<00:04:10.959> it<00:04:11.080> gets<00:04:11.200> low<00:04:11.440> I<00:04:11.709> charge<00:04:12.340> it

00:04:12.449 --> 00:04:12.459 
battery whenever it gets low I charge it

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:15.000 
battery whenever it gets low I charge it
with<00:04:12.610> this<00:04:12.760> trickle<00:04:13.269> charger<00:04:13.600> here<00:04:13.780> and<00:04:14.680> it

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:15.010 
with this trickle charger here and it

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:17.460 
with this trickle charger here and it
this<00:04:15.310> does<00:04:16.180> have<00:04:16.359> a<00:04:16.419> six<00:04:16.690> fold<00:04:16.840> in<00:04:17.049> 12<00:04:17.290> volt

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:17.470 
this does have a six fold in 12 volt

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:18.990 
this does have a six fold in 12 volt
setting<00:04:17.799> so<00:04:17.950> I<00:04:18.010> can<00:04:18.160> actually<00:04:18.489> just<00:04:18.669> run<00:04:18.880> the

00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:19.000 
setting so I can actually just run the

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.210 
setting so I can actually just run the
fan<00:04:19.180> straight<00:04:19.540> from<00:04:19.840> it<00:04:19.959> at<00:04:20.620> two<00:04:20.890> different

00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:21.220 
fan straight from it at two different

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:24.810 
fan straight from it at two different
speeds<00:04:22.440> so<00:04:23.440> I'm<00:04:23.830> gonna<00:04:23.979> go<00:04:24.250> ahead<00:04:24.340> and<00:04:24.460> try<00:04:24.789> to

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:24.820 
speeds so I'm gonna go ahead and try to

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:26.249 
speeds so I'm gonna go ahead and try to
run<00:04:25.030> it<00:04:25.180> here

00:04:26.249 --> 00:04:26.259 
run it here

00:04:26.259 --> 00:04:28.800 
run it here
see<00:04:27.189> if<00:04:27.370> we<00:04:27.849> can<00:04:27.969> get<00:04:28.120> some<00:04:28.300> producer<00:04:28.689> gas

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:28.810 
see if we can get some producer gas

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:30.300 
see if we can get some producer gas
coming<00:04:29.139> out<00:04:29.289> of<00:04:29.409> the<00:04:29.499> top<00:04:29.680> here<00:04:29.889> see<00:04:30.099> if<00:04:30.159> it'll

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:30.310 
coming out of the top here see if it'll

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:33.330 
coming out of the top here see if it'll
light<00:04:31.080> one<00:04:32.080> problem<00:04:32.469> I<00:04:32.560> did<00:04:32.740> have<00:04:32.919> last<00:04:33.189> time

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:33.340 
light one problem I did have last time

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:37.110 
light one problem I did have last time
was<00:04:34.229> or<00:04:35.229> right<00:04:35.469> below<00:04:35.620> the<00:04:35.889> pine<00:04:36.610> cones<00:04:36.909> here

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:37.120 
was or right below the pine cones here

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:39.179 
was or right below the pine cones here
where<00:04:37.330> I<00:04:37.360> had<00:04:37.509> that<00:04:37.689> portion<00:04:38.110> of<00:04:38.259> a<00:04:38.289> PVC

00:04:39.179 --> 00:04:39.189 
where I had that portion of a PVC

00:04:39.189 --> 00:04:42.749 
where I had that portion of a PVC
straight<00:04:39.909> pipe<00:04:40.120> on<00:04:40.389> the<00:04:40.449> top<00:04:41.050> I<00:04:41.289> had<00:04:41.439> put<00:04:41.710> a<00:04:41.949> one

00:04:42.749 --> 00:04:42.759 
straight pipe on the top I had put a one

00:04:42.759 --> 00:04:44.989 
straight pipe on the top I had put a one
of<00:04:42.879> those<00:04:42.999> garden<00:04:43.449> masks<00:04:43.960> that<00:04:44.169> people<00:04:44.499> where

00:04:44.989 --> 00:04:44.999 
of those garden masks that people where

00:04:44.999 --> 00:04:48.149 
of those garden masks that people where
put<00:04:45.999> that<00:04:46.150> over<00:04:46.389> that<00:04:46.539> because<00:04:47.229> I<00:04:47.650> didn't<00:04:48.009> want

00:04:48.149 --> 00:04:48.159 
put that over that because I didn't want

00:04:48.159 --> 00:04:49.769 
put that over that because I didn't want
the<00:04:48.370> car<00:04:48.669> filter<00:04:48.999> getting<00:04:49.270> too<00:04:49.389> gummed<00:04:49.629> up

00:04:49.769 --> 00:04:49.779 
the car filter getting too gummed up

00:04:49.779 --> 00:04:52.559 
the car filter getting too gummed up
with<00:04:49.990> stuff<00:04:50.319> but<00:04:51.069> it<00:04:51.159> eventually<00:04:51.539> got<00:04:52.539> so

00:04:52.559 --> 00:04:52.569 
with stuff but it eventually got so

00:04:52.569 --> 00:04:55.589 
with stuff but it eventually got so
gummed<00:04:52.990> up<00:04:53.139> itself<00:04:53.590> that<00:04:53.800> it<00:04:53.949> it<00:04:54.599> totally

00:04:55.589 --> 00:04:55.599 
gummed up itself that it it totally

00:04:55.599 --> 00:05:00.029 
gummed up itself that it it totally
blocked<00:04:55.870> the<00:04:56.050> whole<00:04:56.229> system<00:04:56.680> so<00:04:58.289> odds<00:04:59.289> are<00:04:59.620> I'm

00:05:00.029 --> 00:05:00.039 
blocked the whole system so odds are I'm

00:05:00.039 --> 00:05:01.649 
blocked the whole system so odds are I'm
gonna<00:05:00.279> get<00:05:00.460> too<00:05:00.639> much<00:05:00.789> tar<00:05:01.090> and<00:05:01.330> it's<00:05:01.479> going<00:05:01.599> to

00:05:01.649 --> 00:05:01.659 
gonna get too much tar and it's going to

00:05:01.659 --> 00:05:05.070 
gonna get too much tar and it's going to
block<00:05:02.620> up<00:05:02.860> that<00:05:03.009> automotive<00:05:03.580> air<00:05:03.699> filter<00:05:04.120> but

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:05.080 
block up that automotive air filter but

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:06.929 
block up that automotive air filter but
I<00:05:05.439> guess<00:05:05.919> that's<00:05:06.069> what<00:05:06.370> we're<00:05:06.550> gonna<00:05:06.669> have<00:05:06.819> to

00:05:06.929 --> 00:05:06.939 
I guess that's what we're gonna have to

00:05:06.939 --> 00:05:08.490 
I guess that's what we're gonna have to
test<00:05:07.120> and<00:05:07.360> see<00:05:07.479> if<00:05:07.599> it<00:05:07.689> does<00:05:07.870> see<00:05:08.199> if<00:05:08.259> it<00:05:08.349> lets

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:08.500 
test and see if it does see if it lets

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:10.769 
test and see if it does see if it lets
enough<00:05:08.710> air<00:05:08.919> through<00:05:09.250> to<00:05:10.120> gets<00:05:10.270> a<00:05:10.419> decent

00:05:10.769 --> 00:05:10.779 
enough air through to gets a decent

00:05:10.779 --> 00:05:13.499 
enough air through to gets a decent
amount<00:05:11.139> of<00:05:11.169> run<00:05:11.379> time<00:05:11.529> through<00:05:12.090> so<00:05:13.090> we'll<00:05:13.360> see

00:05:13.499 --> 00:05:13.509 
amount of run time through so we'll see

00:05:13.509 --> 00:05:17.279 
amount of run time through so we'll see
if<00:05:13.599> that'll<00:05:13.750> work<00:05:14.969> okay<00:05:15.969> so<00:05:16.000> my<00:05:16.689> trial<00:05:17.020> run

00:05:17.279 --> 00:05:17.289 
if that'll work okay so my trial run

00:05:17.289 --> 00:05:20.700 
if that'll work okay so my trial run
failed<00:05:18.479> one<00:05:19.479> major<00:05:19.750> thing<00:05:20.050> that<00:05:20.080> I<00:05:20.259> found<00:05:20.439> out

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:20.710 
failed one major thing that I found out

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:24.510 
failed one major thing that I found out
was<00:05:20.949> this<00:05:21.550> builds<00:05:21.849> blower<00:05:22.089> pump<00:05:22.830> 12-volt<00:05:23.830> DC<00:05:23.919> 4

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:24.520 
was this builds blower pump 12-volt DC 4

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:27.480 
was this builds blower pump 12-volt DC 4
amp<00:05:24.759> I<00:05:24.999> guess<00:05:25.240> that<00:05:26.199> explains<00:05:26.319> how<00:05:27.189> big<00:05:27.370> the

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:27.490 
amp I guess that explains how big the

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:29.730 
amp I guess that explains how big the
motor<00:05:27.669> isn't<00:05:27.849> it<00:05:28.029> but<00:05:28.210> um<00:05:28.409> when<00:05:29.409> I<00:05:29.439> had<00:05:29.620> it

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:29.740 
motor isn't it but um when I had it

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:31.379 
motor isn't it but um when I had it
hooked<00:05:29.830> up<00:05:30.039> to<00:05:30.159> a<00:05:30.189> 12-volt<00:05:30.580> car<00:05:30.819> battery<00:05:30.879> it

00:05:31.379 --> 00:05:31.389 
hooked up to a 12-volt car battery it

00:05:31.389 --> 00:05:33.140 
hooked up to a 12-volt car battery it
was<00:05:31.509> putting<00:05:31.750> its<00:05:32.169> putting<00:05:32.439> way<00:05:32.620> too<00:05:32.650> much

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:33.150 
was putting its putting way too much

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:35.820 
was putting its putting way too much
circulation<00:05:34.150> through<00:05:34.360> the<00:05:34.479> system<00:05:34.870> and<00:05:35.680> it's

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:35.830 
circulation through the system and it's

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:38.760 
circulation through the system and it's
just<00:05:36.069> it's<00:05:36.789> getting<00:05:37.029> the<00:05:37.360> 55<00:05:38.199> gallon<00:05:38.529> barrel

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:38.770 
just it's getting the 55 gallon barrel

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:41.040 
just it's getting the 55 gallon barrel
so<00:05:38.979> hot<00:05:39.250> that<00:05:39.520> it<00:05:39.699> I<00:05:39.879> believe<00:05:40.389> it<00:05:40.569> was<00:05:40.659> actually

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:41.050 
so hot that it I believe it was actually

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:43.019 
so hot that it I believe it was actually
starting<00:05:41.500> to<00:05:41.529> catch<00:05:41.740> the<00:05:42.009> plywood<00:05:42.430> on<00:05:42.550> fire<00:05:42.759> on

00:05:43.019 --> 00:05:43.029 
starting to catch the plywood on fire on

00:05:43.029 --> 00:05:44.550 
starting to catch the plywood on fire on
the<00:05:43.120> bottom<00:05:43.449> but<00:05:43.779> I<00:05:43.810> did<00:05:43.990> realize<00:05:44.139> that<00:05:44.469> I

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:44.560 
the bottom but I did realize that I

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:47.490 
the bottom but I did realize that I
could<00:05:44.770> hook<00:05:45.610> up<00:05:45.849> a<00:05:46.029> just<00:05:46.539> a<00:05:46.599> 12-volt<00:05:47.110> battery

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:47.500 
could hook up a just a 12-volt battery

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:50.579 
could hook up a just a 12-volt battery
not<00:05:47.949> a<00:05:48.009> 12-volt<00:05:48.430> battery<00:05:48.669> a<00:05:49.199> double-a<00:05:50.199> battery

00:05:50.579 --> 00:05:50.589 
not a 12-volt battery a double-a battery

00:05:50.589 --> 00:05:53.100 
not a 12-volt battery a double-a battery
to<00:05:51.129> those<00:05:51.310> and<00:05:51.610> that<00:05:51.789> uh<00:05:51.819> it<00:05:52.599> lowered<00:05:53.050> the

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:53.110 
to those and that uh it lowered the

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:54.749 
to those and that uh it lowered the
speed<00:05:53.439> of<00:05:53.529> the<00:05:53.620> fan<00:05:53.830> enough<00:05:54.189> to<00:05:54.370> where<00:05:54.520> it<00:05:54.639> was

00:05:54.749 --> 00:05:54.759 
speed of the fan enough to where it was

00:05:54.759 --> 00:05:57.749 
speed of the fan enough to where it was
just<00:05:55.500> barely<00:05:56.500> coming<00:05:56.830> out<00:05:57.039> I<00:05:57.069> mean<00:05:57.310> before<00:05:57.430> it

00:05:57.749 --> 00:05:57.759 
just barely coming out I mean before it

00:05:57.759 --> 00:05:59.219 
just barely coming out I mean before it
was<00:05:57.879> shooting<00:05:58.149> it<00:05:58.270> a<00:05:58.330> couple<00:05:58.509> feet<00:05:58.839> out<00:05:59.020> of<00:05:59.169> the

00:05:59.219 --> 00:05:59.229 
was shooting it a couple feet out of the

00:05:59.229 --> 00:06:02.040 
was shooting it a couple feet out of the
end<00:05:59.379> there<00:05:59.620> so<00:06:00.370> the<00:06:00.969> the<00:06:01.330> double-a<00:06:01.689> battery

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:02.050 
end there so the the double-a battery

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:04.379 
end there so the the double-a battery
helped<00:06:02.379> on<00:06:02.669> making<00:06:03.669> the<00:06:03.729> fan<00:06:03.939> blow<00:06:04.149> a<00:06:04.180> little

00:06:04.379 --> 00:06:04.389 
helped on making the fan blow a little

00:06:04.389 --> 00:06:08.670 
helped on making the fan blow a little
bit<00:06:04.509> slower<00:06:04.839> but<00:06:05.830> I<00:06:06.759> think<00:06:07.349> well<00:06:08.349> my<00:06:08.469> major

00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:08.680 
bit slower but I think well my major

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:12.089 
bit slower but I think well my major
problem<00:06:09.009> is<00:06:09.430> and<00:06:10.419> I<00:06:10.689> and<00:06:11.289> all<00:06:11.500> my<00:06:11.529> attempts<00:06:12.009> to

00:06:12.089 --> 00:06:12.099 
problem is and I and all my attempts to

00:06:12.099 --> 00:06:13.769 
problem is and I and all my attempts to
light<00:06:12.279> what<00:06:12.520> was<00:06:12.610> coming<00:06:12.909> out<00:06:13.000> and<00:06:13.360> it<00:06:13.509> even

00:06:13.769 --> 00:06:13.779 
light what was coming out and it even

00:06:13.779 --> 00:06:15.119 
light what was coming out and it even
looked<00:06:13.960> like<00:06:14.139> a<00:06:14.169> little<00:06:14.560> bit<00:06:14.649> of<00:06:14.770> a<00:06:14.830> brown<00:06:15.069> or

00:06:15.119 --> 00:06:15.129 
looked like a little bit of a brown or

00:06:15.129 --> 00:06:18.269 
looked like a little bit of a brown or
gas<00:06:15.490> I<00:06:15.879> mean<00:06:16.300> a<00:06:16.330> browner<00:06:16.659> smoke<00:06:17.139> than<00:06:18.039> just

00:06:18.269 --> 00:06:18.279 
gas I mean a browner smoke than just

00:06:18.279 --> 00:06:21.329 
gas I mean a browner smoke than just
regular<00:06:18.639> white<00:06:18.879> smoke<00:06:19.240> like<00:06:19.479> this<00:06:20.339> my

00:06:21.329 --> 00:06:21.339 
regular white smoke like this my

00:06:21.339 --> 00:06:24.320 
regular white smoke like this my
attempts<00:06:21.729> failed<00:06:22.029> to<00:06:23.020> light<00:06:23.229> that<00:06:23.469> so<00:06:23.770> I

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:24.330 
attempts failed to light that so I

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:27.570 
attempts failed to light that so I
believe<00:06:25.330> what<00:06:26.319> my<00:06:26.349> problem<00:06:26.860> is<00:06:27.039> is<00:06:27.339> that<00:06:27.370> I

00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:27.580 
believe what my problem is is that I

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:29.850 
believe what my problem is is that I
don't<00:06:27.699> have<00:06:28.060> my<00:06:28.270> system<00:06:28.779> completely<00:06:29.169> sealed<00:06:29.589> I

00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:29.860 
don't have my system completely sealed I

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:33.089 
don't have my system completely sealed I
mean<00:06:30.819> I<00:06:30.909> got<00:06:31.089> multiple<00:06:31.870> joints<00:06:32.289> here<00:06:32.649> right

00:06:33.089 --> 00:06:33.099 
mean I got multiple joints here right

00:06:33.099 --> 00:06:34.559 
mean I got multiple joints here right
before<00:06:33.460> I<00:06:33.490> light<00:06:33.759> it<00:06:33.789> where<00:06:34.149> though<00:06:34.300> that's

00:06:34.559 --> 00:06:34.569 
before I light it where though that's

00:06:34.569 --> 00:06:36.850 
before I light it where though that's
sucking<00:06:34.930> in<00:06:35.080> air

00:06:36.850 --> 00:06:36.860 
sucking in air

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:38.950 
sucking in air
it<00:06:37.009> it<00:06:37.580> comes<00:06:37.879> out<00:06:38.030> where<00:06:38.210> these<00:06:38.330> wires<00:06:38.539> come

00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:38.960 
it it comes out where these wires come

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:42.939 
it it comes out where these wires come
out<00:06:39.110> right<00:06:39.319> here<00:06:39.680> all<00:06:40.639> these<00:06:41.680> all<00:06:42.680> these

00:06:42.939 --> 00:06:42.949 
out right here all these all these

00:06:42.949 --> 00:06:45.520 
out right here all these all these
joints<00:06:43.189> and<00:06:43.430> these<00:06:43.520> PVC<00:06:43.849> pipes<00:06:43.969> aren't<00:06:44.599> aren't

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:45.530 
joints and these PVC pipes aren't aren't

00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:49.899 
joints and these PVC pipes aren't aren't
a<00:06:45.860> airtight<00:06:47.020> and<00:06:48.020> then<00:06:48.620> where<00:06:49.009> I've<00:06:49.159> liquid

00:06:49.899 --> 00:06:49.909 
a airtight and then where I've liquid

00:06:49.909 --> 00:06:52.809 
a airtight and then where I've liquid
nailed<00:06:50.180> the<00:06:50.599> the<00:06:51.409> joints<00:06:51.800> on<00:06:51.919> here

00:06:52.809 --> 00:06:52.819 
nailed the the joints on here

00:06:52.819 --> 00:06:54.279 
nailed the the joints on here
those<00:06:53.240> look<00:06:53.419> like<00:06:53.569> they're<00:06:53.750> holding<00:06:53.930> pretty

00:06:54.279 --> 00:06:54.289 
those look like they're holding pretty

00:06:54.289 --> 00:06:57.249 
those look like they're holding pretty
well<00:06:54.500> but<00:06:55.069> not<00:06:55.539> too<00:06:56.539> much<00:06:56.659> smoke<00:06:56.930> comes<00:06:57.139> out

00:06:57.249 --> 00:06:57.259 
well but not too much smoke comes out

00:06:57.259 --> 00:07:00.219 
well but not too much smoke comes out
there<00:06:57.580> but<00:06:58.580> definitely<00:06:59.210> another<00:06:59.629> weakness<00:07:00.080> is

00:07:00.219 --> 00:07:00.229 
there but definitely another weakness is

00:07:00.229 --> 00:07:01.719 
there but definitely another weakness is
this<00:07:00.409> elbow<00:07:00.740> right<00:07:00.919> here<00:07:00.979> where<00:07:01.310> I'd<00:07:01.430> liquid

00:07:01.719 --> 00:07:01.729 
this elbow right here where I'd liquid

00:07:01.729 --> 00:07:03.070 
this elbow right here where I'd liquid
nailed<00:07:01.939> this<00:07:02.150> and<00:07:02.389> this<00:07:02.479> is<00:07:02.629> where<00:07:02.810> it<00:07:02.930> takes

00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:03.080 
nailed this and this is where it takes

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:06.129 
nailed this and this is where it takes
the<00:07:03.379> the<00:07:03.889> most<00:07:04.069> of<00:07:04.219> the<00:07:04.340> heat<00:07:04.580> I<00:07:04.930> know<00:07:05.930> it

00:07:06.129 --> 00:07:06.139 
the the most of the heat I know it

00:07:06.139 --> 00:07:07.450 
the the most of the heat I know it
really<00:07:06.379> probably<00:07:06.620> wasn't<00:07:06.889> the<00:07:07.039> best<00:07:07.219> thing<00:07:07.280> to

00:07:07.450 --> 00:07:07.460 
really probably wasn't the best thing to

00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:11.110 
really probably wasn't the best thing to
use<00:07:07.669> but<00:07:07.879> it<00:07:08.210> was<00:07:08.330> the<00:07:08.449> cheapest<00:07:09.250> so<00:07:10.250> it<00:07:10.879> looks

00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:11.120 
use but it was the cheapest so it looks

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:12.640 
use but it was the cheapest so it looks
like<00:07:11.270> we<00:07:11.389> were<00:07:11.479> leaking<00:07:11.840> a<00:07:11.900> lot<00:07:12.050> out<00:07:12.349> of<00:07:12.500> there

00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:12.650 
like we were leaking a lot out of there

00:07:12.650 --> 00:07:14.379 
like we were leaking a lot out of there
so<00:07:13.039> I'm<00:07:13.159> gonna<00:07:13.279> have<00:07:13.490> to<00:07:13.639> scrape<00:07:13.879> all<00:07:14.060> that<00:07:14.090> off

00:07:14.379 --> 00:07:14.389 
so I'm gonna have to scrape all that off

00:07:14.389 --> 00:07:16.869 
so I'm gonna have to scrape all that off
and<00:07:14.659> liquid<00:07:15.409> nail<00:07:15.620> or<00:07:15.919> not<00:07:16.310> liquid<00:07:16.580> nail<00:07:16.729> it

00:07:16.869 --> 00:07:16.879 
and liquid nail or not liquid nail it

00:07:16.879 --> 00:07:20.200 
and liquid nail or not liquid nail it
nam<00:07:17.259> jb<00:07:18.259> weld<00:07:18.439> that<00:07:18.680> it<00:07:19.460> looks<00:07:19.610> like<00:07:19.759> my<00:07:19.879> JB

00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:20.210 
nam jb weld that it looks like my JB

00:07:20.210 --> 00:07:21.610 
nam jb weld that it looks like my JB
Wells<00:07:20.419> holding<00:07:20.750> up<00:07:20.810> quite<00:07:20.960> well<00:07:21.259> in<00:07:21.379> the<00:07:21.469> high

00:07:21.610 --> 00:07:21.620 
Wells holding up quite well in the high

00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:25.240 
Wells holding up quite well in the high
heat<00:07:21.830> areas<00:07:23.770> it's<00:07:24.770> like<00:07:24.919> everything's

00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:25.250 
heat areas it's like everything's

00:07:25.250 --> 00:07:29.890 
heat areas it's like everything's
airtight<00:07:25.639> right<00:07:25.879> there<00:07:28.599> that<00:07:29.599> looks<00:07:29.779> like

00:07:29.890 --> 00:07:29.900 
airtight right there that looks like

00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:32.110 
airtight right there that looks like
that<00:07:30.370> putting<00:07:31.370> a<00:07:31.430> little<00:07:31.550> bit<00:07:31.729> of<00:07:31.819> air<00:07:31.939> out

00:07:32.110 --> 00:07:32.120 
that putting a little bit of air out

00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:34.089 
that putting a little bit of air out
there<00:07:32.360> and<00:07:32.569> so<00:07:32.870> that<00:07:33.110> would<00:07:33.439> be<00:07:33.500> sucking<00:07:33.919> here

00:07:34.089 --> 00:07:34.099 
there and so that would be sucking here

00:07:34.099 --> 00:07:36.249 
there and so that would be sucking here
right<00:07:34.340> in<00:07:34.490> there<00:07:34.699> so<00:07:34.969> I'm<00:07:35.719> gonna<00:07:35.930> either<00:07:36.139> have

to<00:07:36.560> just<00:07:36.770> discontinue<00:07:37.759> that

00:07:38.590 --> 00:07:38.600 
to just discontinue that

00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:41.980 
to just discontinue that
plug<00:07:39.470> it<00:07:39.590> up<00:07:39.680> with<00:07:39.830> some<00:07:39.980> navy<00:07:40.310> weld<00:07:40.520> or<00:07:40.930> find<00:07:41.930> a

00:07:41.980 --> 00:07:41.990 
plug it up with some navy weld or find a

00:07:41.990 --> 00:07:45.850 
plug it up with some navy weld or find a
way<00:07:42.140> to<00:07:42.200> seal<00:07:42.470> that<00:07:42.560> tight<00:07:43.930> so<00:07:44.930> right<00:07:45.710> now<00:07:45.830> I

00:07:45.850 --> 00:07:45.860 
way to seal that tight so right now I

00:07:45.860 --> 00:07:47.710 
way to seal that tight so right now I
think<00:07:46.040> I<00:07:46.250> just<00:07:46.280> got<00:07:46.580> a<00:07:46.640> problem<00:07:46.940> with<00:07:47.210> sealing

00:07:47.710 --> 00:07:47.720 
think I just got a problem with sealing

00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:52.030 
think I just got a problem with sealing
up<00:07:47.840> all<00:07:48.280> the<00:07:49.280> places<00:07:49.550> on<00:07:50.030> this<00:07:51.040> gasification

00:07:52.030 --> 00:07:52.040 
up all the places on this gasification

00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:54.770 
system where air is getting in and I

00:07:54.770 --> 00:07:57.550 
system where air is getting in and I
think<00:07:55.010> it's<00:07:55.130> just<00:07:55.190> deluding<00:07:56.380> diluting<00:07:57.380> my

00:07:57.550 --> 00:07:57.560 
think it's just deluding diluting my

00:07:57.560 --> 00:07:59.380

00:07:59.380 --> 00:07:59.390 
producer gas that eventually is coming

00:07:59.390 --> 00:08:01.600
