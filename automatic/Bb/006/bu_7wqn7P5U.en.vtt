in<00:01:56.399> customizing<00:01:57.030> you<00:01:57.719> have<00:01:57.930> to<00:01:58.079> build<00:01:58.290> up<00:01:58.439> the

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
in customizing you have to build up the

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:01.280 
in customizing you have to build up the
sculpt<00:01:59.159> of<00:01:59.310> the<00:01:59.490> wrist<00:01:59.729> as<00:02:00.000> well<00:02:00.509> now<00:02:00.990> looking

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
sculpt of the wrist as well now looking

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.770 
sculpt of the wrist as well now looking
at<00:02:01.380> articulation<00:02:02.219> the<00:02:02.250> head<00:02:02.430> rotates<00:02:03.119> side<00:02:03.509> to

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
at articulation the head rotates side to

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.100 
at articulation the head rotates side to
side<00:02:04.079> it<00:02:04.710> also<00:02:04.920> looks<00:02:05.460> down<00:02:05.909> quite<00:02:06.390> a<00:02:06.420> decent

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
side it also looks down quite a decent

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:07.850 
side it also looks down quite a decent
amount

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
amount

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.570 
amount
and<00:02:07.950> then<00:02:08.490> also<00:02:09.090> looks<00:02:09.420> up<00:02:09.720> my<00:02:10.320> tiny<00:02:10.680> bit<00:02:11.100> and

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
and then also looks up my tiny bit and

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.670 
and then also looks up my tiny bit and
then<00:02:11.820> the<00:02:12.030> ponytail<00:02:12.660> is<00:02:12.930> a<00:02:12.960> separate

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
then the ponytail is a separate

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.280 
then the ponytail is a separate
articulated<00:02:14.490> piece<00:02:14.820> so<00:02:15.450> you<00:02:15.480> can<00:02:15.810> post<00:02:16.110> that

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
articulated piece so you can post that

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.380 
articulated piece so you can post that
as<00:02:16.560> if<00:02:16.710> it's<00:02:16.860> flailing<00:02:17.370> around<00:02:17.520> in<00:02:17.940> the<00:02:18.150> wind

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390

for<00:02:18.900> the<00:02:18.930> shoulder<00:02:19.380> rotation<00:02:19.950> it's<00:02:20.100> a<00:02:20.190> clip

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:20.520 
for the shoulder rotation it's a clip

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.790 
for the shoulder rotation it's a clip
joint<00:02:20.850> and<00:02:21.060> it's<00:02:21.180> crazy<00:02:21.690> loud<00:02:22.110> that<00:02:22.500> ugly

out<00:03:38.599> to<00:03:38.930> the<00:03:38.959> side<00:03:39.110> and<00:03:39.770> back<00:03:40.160> in<00:03:40.489> it's<00:03:40.700> a<00:03:40.790> bit

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:40.940 
out to the side and back in it's a bit

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:43.540 
out to the side and back in it's a bit
of<00:03:41.060> a<00:03:41.150> wrestle<00:03:41.660> but<00:03:41.870> they<00:03:42.050> also<00:03:42.319> move<00:03:42.890> forwards

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:43.550 
of a wrestle but they also move forwards

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:46.600 
of a wrestle but they also move forwards
and<00:03:43.880> backwards<00:03:44.750> the<00:03:45.620> leg<00:03:45.830> revolves<00:03:46.489> around

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:46.610 
and backwards the leg revolves around

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:49.630 
and backwards the leg revolves around
the<00:03:47.150> hip<00:03:47.420> joint<00:03:47.780> and<00:03:48.050> there's<00:03:48.890> a<00:03:49.010> single

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:49.640 
the hip joint and there's a single

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:52.420 
the hip joint and there's a single
jointed<00:03:50.420> knee<00:03:50.780> just<00:03:51.769> going<00:03:51.920> to<00:03:51.980> remove<00:03:52.250> the

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:52.430 
jointed knee just going to remove the

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:54.160 
jointed knee just going to remove the
chain<00:03:52.730> from<00:03:52.760> the<00:03:53.030> ankle<00:03:53.569> so<00:03:53.660> you<00:03:53.750> get<00:03:53.930> a<00:03:53.959> better

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:54.170 
chain from the ankle so you get a better

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:57.059 
chain from the ankle so you get a better
look<00:03:54.410> at<00:03:54.530> the<00:03:54.560> articulation<00:03:54.890> there<00:03:55.849> it<00:03:56.450> is

00:03:57.059 --> 00:03:57.069 
look at the articulation there it is

00:03:57.069 --> 00:04:00.729 
look at the articulation there it is
rotation<00:03:58.069> of<00:03:58.310> mid<00:03:58.760> lower<00:03:59.030> leg<00:03:59.510> and<00:03:59.810> then<00:04:00.500> the

00:04:00.729 --> 00:04:00.739 
rotation of mid lower leg and then the

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:02.680 
rotation of mid lower leg and then the
ankle<00:04:01.250> moves<00:04:01.550> backwards<00:04:02.090> and<00:04:02.269> forward

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:02.690 
ankle moves backwards and forward

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:04.479 
ankle moves backwards and forward
slightly<00:04:03.019> there's<00:04:03.440> a<00:04:03.500> bit<00:04:03.680> of<00:04:03.799> a<00:04:03.890> pivot<00:04:04.310> and

00:04:04.479 --> 00:04:04.489 
slightly there's a bit of a pivot and

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:06.640 
slightly there's a bit of a pivot and
also<00:04:04.970> toe<00:04:05.239> articulation<00:04:06.230> now<00:04:06.470> it's
