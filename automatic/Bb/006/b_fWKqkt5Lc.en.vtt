iMovie<00:01:28.100> the<00:01:28.820> problem<00:01:29.180> with<00:01:29.330> that<00:01:29.509> is<00:01:29.840> if<00:01:30.380> you

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:30.500 
iMovie the problem with that is if you

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:33.219 
iMovie the problem with that is if you
created<00:01:30.860> any<00:01:31.160> animations<00:01:31.910> it's<00:01:32.330> not<00:01:32.780> going<00:01:33.080> to

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:33.229 
created any animations it's not going to

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:35.620 
created any animations it's not going to
pull<00:01:33.470> in<00:01:33.710> the<00:01:33.860> animation<00:01:34.490> so<00:01:35.000> this<00:01:35.210> is<00:01:35.390> the<00:01:35.539> way

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:35.630 
pull in the animation so this is the way

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:38.800 
pull in the animation so this is the way
I<00:01:35.660> do<00:01:35.899> it<00:01:36.110> go<00:01:36.830> to<00:01:36.860> export

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:38.810 
I do it go to export

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:41.410 
I do it go to export
and<00:01:39.100> go<00:01:40.100> to<00:01:40.159> quick<00:01:40.490> time<00:01:40.760> now<00:01:41.030> I<00:01:41.060> know<00:01:41.180> what

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:41.420 
and go to quick time now I know what

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:43.149 
and go to quick time now I know what
some<00:01:41.600> of<00:01:41.630> you<00:01:41.840> are<00:01:41.869> thinking<00:01:42.140> quick<00:01:42.680> time<00:01:42.950> will

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:43.159 
some of you are thinking quick time will

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:46.300 
some of you are thinking quick time will
not<00:01:43.310> open<00:01:43.640> or<00:01:44.360> import<00:01:44.930> into<00:01:45.140> iMovie<00:01:45.650> so<00:01:45.830> this

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:46.310 
not open or import into iMovie so this

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:48.910 
not open or import into iMovie so this
is<00:01:46.490> how<00:01:46.700> I<00:01:46.729> get<00:01:47.180> around<00:01:47.420> that<00:01:47.690> so<00:01:48.560> you<00:01:48.619> name

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:48.920
