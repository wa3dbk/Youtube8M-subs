00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
on this one is a lot quieter than my

on this one is a lot quieter than my
micron<00:00:15.830> this<00:00:16.830> is<00:00:17.039> what<00:00:17.190> the<00:00:17.340> baffle<00:00:17.850> and<00:00:18.859> you

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
micron this is what the baffle and you

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:25.040 
micron this is what the baffle and you
kind<00:00:20.279> of<00:00:20.310> get<00:00:20.460> an<00:00:20.609> idea<00:00:21.500> it's<00:00:22.500> a<00:00:23.840> still<00:00:24.840> has<00:00:25.019> a

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
kind of get an idea it's a still has a

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.980 
kind of get an idea it's a still has a
good<00:00:25.289> bite<00:00:25.500> to<00:00:25.769> it<00:00:25.800> but<00:00:26.670> probably<00:00:27.480> not<00:00:27.779> as

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
good bite to it but probably not as

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.740 
good bite to it but probably not as
annoying<00:00:28.439> to<00:00:28.800> your<00:00:28.980> neighbors<00:00:29.480> let<00:00:30.480> me<00:00:30.570> go

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
annoying to your neighbors let me go

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.610 
annoying to your neighbors let me go
ahead<00:00:30.840> and<00:00:31.050> fire<00:00:31.260> that<00:00:31.500> up<00:00:31.529> for<00:00:32.009> you<00:00:33.050> okay

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
ahead and fire that up for you okay

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:44.470 
ahead and fire that up for you okay
turning<00:00:35.219> on<00:00:36.920> hit<00:00:37.920> the<00:00:37.950> button<00:00:42.590> as<00:00:43.590> you<00:00:43.829> hear<00:00:44.070> it

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:44.480 
turning on hit the button as you hear it

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:48.520 
turning on hit the button as you hear it
kind<00:00:45.480> of<00:00:45.570> kind<00:00:46.110> of<00:00:46.170> choke<00:00:46.440> down<00:00:46.680> compared<00:00:47.280> to

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:48.530 
kind of kind of choke down compared to

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:51.660 
kind of kind of choke down compared to
my<00:00:49.530> clock

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:51.670 
my clock

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
my clock
still<00:00:55.650> still<00:00:56.650> sounds<00:00:57.010> pretty<00:00:57.040> good<00:00:57.630> so<00:00:58.630> you

00:00:58.680 --> 00:00:58.690 
still still sounds pretty good so you

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:00.270 
still still sounds pretty good so you
remember<00:00:58.900> you<00:00:59.050> take<00:00:59.200> a<00:00:59.230> boy<00:00:59.440> that<00:00:59.710> sounds<00:01:00.070> loud

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:00.280 
remember you take a boy that sounds loud

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:08.400 
remember you take a boy that sounds loud
right<00:01:03.150> well<00:01:04.150> I<00:01:05.610> guess<00:01:06.610> it<00:01:06.940> it<00:01:07.510> does<00:01:07.870> compared

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:08.410 
right well I guess it it does compared

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:13.860 
right well I guess it it does compared
to<00:01:08.560> stock<00:01:08.890> but<00:01:09.430> here's<00:01:09.880> a<00:01:10.530> micron<00:01:12.570> for<00:01:13.570> that

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:13.870 
to stock but here's a micron for that

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:30.540 
to stock but here's a micron for that
off<00:01:14.140> I<00:01:21.810> don't<00:01:22.810> little<00:01:23.050> louder

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:30.550 

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:34.270 

I'll<00:01:31.550> go<00:01:31.730> ahead<00:01:31.910> fire<00:01:32.240> off<00:01:32.510> the<00:01:33.010> other<00:01:34.010> one

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:34.280 
I'll go ahead fire off the other one

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:42.300 
I'll go ahead fire off the other one
again

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:42.310 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:48.500 

down<00:01:42.460> the<00:01:42.670> middle<00:01:42.850> of<00:01:43.180> both<00:01:43.479> right<00:01:43.960> now

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:48.510 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:55.370 

you<00:01:48.780> can<00:01:48.960> barely<00:01:49.200> even<00:01:49.470> hear<00:01:50.180> the<00:01:51.180> Yoshi<00:01:54.380> idly

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
you can barely even hear the Yoshi idly

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:00.380 
you can barely even hear the Yoshi idly
compared<00:01:55.950> to<00:01:56.100> the<00:01:56.190> micron

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:16.059 

I<00:02:00.479> could<00:02:00.840> be<00:02:00.960> a<00:02:00.990> rapper<00:02:01.200> bow

00:02:16.059 --> 00:02:16.069 

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:25.330 

they<00:02:16.459> are<00:02:17.200> we<00:02:18.200> think

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.340 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:30.690 

as<00:02:25.970> you<00:02:26.090> tell<00:02:26.360> it<00:02:26.540> is<00:02:26.690> definitely<00:02:27.170> quieter

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:30.700 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:34.300 

that's<00:02:31.700> it<00:02:32.410> you<00:02:33.410> can<00:02:33.560> find<00:02:33.800> more<00:02:33.950> information

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:34.310 
that's it you can find more information

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:39.970 
that's it you can find more information
