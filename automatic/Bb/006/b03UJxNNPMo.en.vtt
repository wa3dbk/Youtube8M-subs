00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:24.540
 we are here in Ulrichen on our 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.500
 winter festivals and this year 

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:30.150
 A special motto of this motto is 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:32.660
 very powerful rear-wheel drive 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.660
 vehicles 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:16.340
 It was like we want to try here once 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:18.450
 to show if it is possible 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:20.190
 Vehicles usually in this 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:24.750
 season more for the garage than for the 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:25.710
 thought are very safe and great 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.940
 emotionally 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.940
 also to move in the snow 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:46.980
 I'm looking here at the winter tuning 

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:51.510
 to be in the event we are we 

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:55.670
 along with our tune on as long as possible 

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:55.670
 his scooter and have 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:13.760
 name is a businessman and I represent 

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:13.760
 you leave as always 

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:27.100
 as well as last year we were able to 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:29.080
 This year again Armin Black 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:31.110
 win for our test drives 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:33.310
 the black is multiple 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:35.560
 rally champions international and 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:58.420
 national and tests here our mature 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:03:07.710
 on station your my name is on 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:11.470
 Lost is not lost to me like 

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:13.330
 that they are really broad behind 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:15.940
 work on the performance cars 

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:19.710
 that have the very good adhesion too 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:19.710
 is really the snow still very good 

00:03:25.159 --> 00:03:30.260
 i am the cooler i come from 

00:03:27.629 --> 00:03:30.260
 company light byte 

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:53.870
 the challenge with this 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:56.510
 The event consisted of these exotics 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:58.220
 all with the appropriate tire dimensions 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:59.810
 to provide the then also the 

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:05.870
 corresponding performance on this 

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:08.120
 stopped there we have the 

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:09.980
 driving aids all turned off so 

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:11.690
 traction control and everything to 

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:13.640
 shut down, we have come out 

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:15.769
 really tried the cars with 

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:17.840
 to drive the full power and it is 

00:04:15.769 --> 00:04:18.500
 everyone's cake comes with a lot 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:20.209
 slowly 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:21.500
 we came back just fine 

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:23.750
 and of course it was one 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:25.280
 challenge is for the tuning cars 

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:27.740
 because I'm working on june cars 

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:30.530
 of course with evidence of good adhesion 

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:32.030
 very good but I have to 10 m with 

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:34.250
 the vehicles out for a ski vacation 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:37.120
 can drive and get there where 

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:37.120
 after all, negotiated 

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:50.470
 the cars had the start rather be here 

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:55.330
 work very well in the snow 

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:57.860
 with the continental winter tires and 

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:59.540
 brinkmann statement is that you too 

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:00.890
 with such vehicles in winter 

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:02.960
 can drive quite well 

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:06.830
 Munich started with the continental 

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:09.340
 ts 830 p and have to say at the bmw 

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:12.130
 vehicle and so much to say that 

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:14.690
 mature you will be fine on this car 

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:15.920
 has shown it was due to the 

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:17.270
 weight ratios in this car 

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:20.960
 Completely challenge 

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:22.580
 but really once the dare 20 km 

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:24.380
 We have no problem at all 

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:24.980
 Of course there was good grip 

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:27.230
 built up 

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:28.670
 Steering precision was higher 

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:30.890
 These speeds are scary 

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:33.550
 well steer and steer and through the 

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:33.550
 I have to say bank 

00:05:45.889 --> 00:05:51.060
 that is very well done here so the 

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:52.770
 Cars have very very good traction very much 

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:54.840
 good brake but by and large 

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:56.910
 have to say respect for this 

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:59.270
 performance wide tire in winter 

00:05:56.910 --> 00:05:59.270
 Area 

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:11.750
 everywhere happy smiling faces 

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:14.210
 from a great scenery with 

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:16.280
 excellent beautiful vehicles and the 

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:19.630
 Father's is that we both 

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:22.550
 with the 810 as well as with the ts 830 p 

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:24.100
 have found a mature one 

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:25.940
 balance on these different 

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:28.430
 can represent vehicle concepts 

00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:30.760
 the theme of winter actually for 

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:30.760
 summer
