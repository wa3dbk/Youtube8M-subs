capability and download and upload speed
in<00:00:21.000> the<00:00:21.119> near<00:00:21.300> future<00:00:21.380> so<00:00:22.380> this<00:00:23.039> is<00:00:23.460> a<00:00:23.789> story

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
in the near future so this is a story

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.060 
in the near future so this is a story
that<00:00:24.449> is<00:00:24.720> coming<00:00:24.960> out<00:00:25.170> in<00:00:25.230> the<00:00:25.680> technology

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
that is coming out in the technology

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.450 
that is coming out in the technology
world<00:00:26.340> the<00:00:27.330> fastest<00:00:28.019> broadband<00:00:28.920> internet

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
world the fastest broadband internet

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.340 
world the fastest broadband internet
speeds<00:00:29.820> have<00:00:30.599> been<00:00:31.019> achieved<00:00:31.489> so<00:00:32.489> this<00:00:33.090> was<00:00:33.660> in

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
speeds have been achieved so this was in

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.790 
speeds have been achieved so this was in
London<00:00:34.829> they<00:00:35.760> did<00:00:36.120> a<00:00:36.360> real-world<00:00:36.870> test<00:00:37.500> this

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
London they did a real-world test this

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.670 
London they did a real-world test this
wasn't<00:00:38.309> just<00:00:38.370> in<00:00:38.820> some<00:00:39.149> lab<00:00:39.450> but<00:00:40.170> they<00:00:40.379> have

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
wasn't just in some lab but they have

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.180 
wasn't just in some lab but they have
developed<00:00:41.070> a<00:00:41.520> faster<00:00:42.270> method<00:00:42.629> of

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:43.190 
developed a faster method of

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:46.880 
developed a faster method of
transmitting<00:00:44.190> data<00:00:44.550> through<00:00:45.539> the<00:00:45.750> cables<00:00:46.170> so

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
transmitting data through the cables so

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.619 
transmitting data through the cables so
they<00:00:47.370> were<00:00:47.430> able<00:00:47.579> to<00:00:48.149> transfer<00:00:49.489> 1.4<00:00:50.489> Tara<00:00:51.300> bits

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
they were able to transfer 1.4 Tara bits

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:55.910 
they were able to transfer 1.4 Tara bits
of<00:00:52.190> information<00:00:53.190> per<00:00:53.809> second<00:00:54.809> now<00:00:55.289> to<00:00:55.350> let<00:00:55.770> you

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
of information per second now to let you

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.799 
of information per second now to let you
know<00:00:56.039> what<00:00:56.250> that<00:00:56.430> is<00:00:56.460> they<00:00:57.210> say<00:00:57.420> one<00:00:57.660> of<00:00:57.690> the

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
know what that is they say one of the

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.380 
know what that is they say one of the
faster<00:00:58.590> internet<00:00:59.100> connections<00:00:59.609> in<00:00:59.850> the<00:01:00.000> UK

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
faster internet connections in the UK

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.380 
faster internet connections in the UK
right<00:01:00.420> now<00:01:00.870> is<00:01:01.170> virgin<00:01:01.770> they<00:01:02.219> offer<00:01:02.520> a<00:01:02.760> hundred

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
right now is virgin they offer a hundred

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.899 
right now is virgin they offer a hundred
and<00:01:03.600> 20<00:01:04.080> megabits<00:01:04.589> per<00:01:04.769> second<00:01:05.400> they<00:01:05.729> say

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
and 20 megabits per second they say

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:10.390 
and 20 megabits per second they say
there<00:01:06.150> are<00:01:06.500> 1024<00:01:07.500> megabits<00:01:08.430> in<00:01:08.670> one<00:01:09.350> gigabit

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:10.400 
there are 1024 megabits in one gigabit

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:16.280 
there are 1024 megabits in one gigabit
there<00:01:11.400> are<00:01:11.990> 1024<00:01:13.070> gigabits<00:01:14.070> em<00:01:14.430> one<00:01:15.290> terabit

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
there are 1024 gigabits em one terabit

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.850 
there are 1024 gigabits em one terabit
so<00:01:17.250> they<00:01:17.700> were<00:01:17.759> able<00:01:17.880> to<00:01:18.240> achieve<00:01:18.860> 1.4

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
so they were able to achieve 1.4

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.700 
so they were able to achieve 1.4
terabits<00:01:20.820> per<00:01:20.840> second<00:01:21.840> and<00:01:21.990> if<00:01:22.259> you<00:01:22.380> want<00:01:22.619> to

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
terabits per second and if you want to

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.859 
terabits per second and if you want to
know<00:01:22.860> how<00:01:23.130> fast<00:01:23.460> that<00:01:23.790> is<00:01:24.030> or<00:01:24.299> how<00:01:24.330> much<00:01:24.689> you

know how fast that is or how much you

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.020 
know how fast that is or how much you
could<00:01:25.080> download<00:01:25.259> they<00:01:26.220> say<00:01:26.520> that<00:01:26.700> you<00:01:26.820> could

they have laid and paid all this money

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.810 
they have laid and paid all this money
for<00:01:51.000> a<00:01:51.470> lot<00:01:52.470> of<00:01:52.590> them<00:01:52.740> is<00:01:52.860> already<00:01:53.280> taken<00:01:53.610> care

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
for a lot of them is already taken care

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.789 
for a lot of them is already taken care
of<00:01:53.850> so<00:01:54.240> if<00:01:54.420> they<00:01:54.600> just<00:01:54.840> want<00:01:54.990> to<00:01:55.110> upgrade<00:01:55.320> their

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
of so if they just want to upgrade their

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:58.069 
of so if they just want to upgrade their
infrastructure<00:01:56.520> it's<00:01:56.880> going<00:01:57.299> to<00:01:57.390> be<00:01:57.570> a<00:01:57.600> lot

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
infrastructure it's going to be a lot

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:00.020 
infrastructure it's going to be a lot
more<00:01:58.110> cost<00:01:58.619> effective<00:01:59.189> and<00:01:59.310> they're<00:01:59.729> going<00:01:59.909> to

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
more cost effective and they're going to

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.600 
more cost effective and they're going to
be<00:02:00.149> able<00:02:00.210> to<00:02:00.390> reach<00:02:00.570> tremendous<00:02:01.560> speeds<00:02:02.009> now

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
be able to reach tremendous speeds now

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.160 
be able to reach tremendous speeds now
of<00:02:02.790> course<00:02:02.850> this<00:02:03.240> has<00:02:03.479> other<00:02:03.810> huge

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
of course this has other huge

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:05.899 
of course this has other huge
implications<00:02:04.860> especially<00:02:05.430> when<00:02:05.579> you<00:02:05.670> start

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
implications especially when you start

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:08.330 
implications especially when you start
looking<00:02:05.969> at<00:02:06.270> things<00:02:06.479> like<00:02:06.810> the<00:02:07.649> cloud<00:02:07.979> where

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
looking at things like the cloud where

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:09.440 
looking at things like the cloud where
people<00:02:08.610> have<00:02:08.729> been<00:02:08.879> saying<00:02:09.149> you<00:02:09.270> know

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
people have been saying you know

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:10.070 
people have been saying you know
internet<00:02:09.810> is

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
internet is

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.110 
internet is
just<00:02:10.200> too<00:02:10.410> slow<00:02:10.770> for<00:02:10.800> anything<00:02:11.250> like<00:02:11.580> that<00:02:11.640> and

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
just too slow for anything like that and

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.540 
just too slow for anything like that and
then<00:02:12.750> you<00:02:12.900> wake<00:02:13.080> up<00:02:13.110> to<00:02:13.440> news<00:02:13.620> like<00:02:13.890> this<00:02:13.920> and

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:14.550 
then you wake up to news like this and

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:17.170 
then you wake up to news like this and
they<00:02:14.730> say<00:02:14.970> look<00:02:15.270> you<00:02:15.870> know<00:02:16.020> this<00:02:16.320> is<00:02:16.470> the<00:02:16.620> same

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:17.180 
they say look you know this is the same

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:19.850 
they say look you know this is the same
cables<00:02:18.180> and<00:02:18.450> lines<00:02:18.720> that<00:02:19.110> are<00:02:19.290> basically

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
cables and lines that are basically

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:22.460 
cables and lines that are basically
around<00:02:20.820> a<00:02:21.030> lot<00:02:21.270> of<00:02:21.450> the<00:02:21.570> world<00:02:21.780> right<00:02:22.020> now<00:02:22.050> and

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
around a lot of the world right now and

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:24.950 
around a lot of the world right now and
we<00:02:23.070> were<00:02:23.190> able<00:02:23.310> to<00:02:23.520> achieve<00:02:23.610> this<00:02:24.330> type<00:02:24.690> of

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:24.960 
we were able to achieve this type of

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:28.790 
we were able to achieve this type of
information<00:02:25.620> data<00:02:26.580> transfer<00:02:27.270> so<00:02:27.930> and<00:02:28.260> it's

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800 
information data transfer so and it's

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:30.590 
information data transfer so and it's
not<00:02:29.100> going<00:02:29.310> to<00:02:29.460> be<00:02:29.520> coming<00:02:29.850> any<00:02:30.000> time<00:02:30.120> in<00:02:30.480> the

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:30.600 
not going to be coming any time in the

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.180 
not going to be coming any time in the
next<00:02:30.720> few<00:02:31.020> months<00:02:31.200> so<00:02:31.500> don't<00:02:31.530> look<00:02:31.920> for<00:02:31.980> it

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
next few months so don't look for it

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:34.970 
next few months so don't look for it
anytime<00:02:32.760> that<00:02:32.790> soon<00:02:33.390> but<00:02:34.260> you<00:02:34.410> know<00:02:34.530> soon<00:02:34.740> is<00:02:34.950> a

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
anytime that soon but you know soon is a

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:37.310 
anytime that soon but you know soon is a
relative<00:02:35.130> term<00:02:35.940> and<00:02:36.210> I<00:02:36.270> would<00:02:36.450> say<00:02:36.690> you<00:02:37.170> know

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:37.320 
relative term and I would say you know

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:39.620 
relative term and I would say you know
in<00:02:37.530> the<00:02:37.650> next<00:02:37.800> few<00:02:38.160> years<00:02:38.220> it<00:02:38.940> definitely

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:39.630 
in the next few years it definitely

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:41.600 
in the next few years it definitely
could<00:02:39.870> be<00:02:39.930> a<00:02:40.260> possibility<00:02:40.830> if<00:02:41.250> this

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
could be a possibility if this

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:44.660 
could be a possibility if this
technology<00:02:42.510> works<00:02:43.290> out<00:02:43.650> they<00:02:44.130> do<00:02:44.190> say

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
technology works out they do say

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:46.310 
technology works out they do say
whenever<00:02:45.000> you<00:02:45.240> do<00:02:45.450> get<00:02:45.600> up<00:02:45.720> to<00:02:45.840> speeds<00:02:46.110> like

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:46.320 
whenever you do get up to speeds like

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:49.280 
whenever you do get up to speeds like
this<00:02:46.620> there<00:02:46.890> are<00:02:46.920> some<00:02:47.490> problems<00:02:48.180> of<00:02:48.840> course

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
this there are some problems of course

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:52.670 
this there are some problems of course
with<00:02:50.120> information<00:02:51.120> may<00:02:51.720> be<00:02:51.750> becoming<00:02:52.080> more

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
with information may be becoming more

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:55.610 
with information may be becoming more
error<00:02:53.010> like<00:02:54.000> having<00:02:54.600> more<00:02:54.780> errors<00:02:55.230> in<00:02:55.440> the

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
error like having more errors in the

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:57.199 
error like having more errors in the
information<00:02:56.100> because<00:02:56.370> there<00:02:56.610> is<00:02:56.790> so<00:02:57.060> much

00:02:57.199 --> 00:02:57.209 
information because there is so much

00:02:57.209 --> 00:02:59.960 
information because there is so much
data<00:02:57.450> being<00:02:57.780> transferred<00:02:58.080> so<00:02:58.620> fast<00:02:58.950> so<00:02:59.520> there

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
data being transferred so fast so there

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:01.850 
data being transferred so fast so there
are<00:03:00.180> a<00:03:00.209> few<00:03:00.780> little<00:03:00.930> kinks<00:03:01.350> to<00:03:01.410> still<00:03:01.709> be

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:01.860 
are a few little kinks to still be

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:03.140 
are a few little kinks to still be
worked<00:03:02.070> out<00:03:02.220> but<00:03:02.400> I<00:03:02.459> mean<00:03:02.610> even<00:03:02.820> if<00:03:03.030> they

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
worked out but I mean even if they

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:05.510 
worked out but I mean even if they
dialed<00:03:03.600> it<00:03:03.690> down<00:03:03.720> just<00:03:04.170> a<00:03:04.320> little<00:03:04.470> bit<00:03:04.590> too

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:05.520 
dialed it down just a little bit too

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:07.370 
dialed it down just a little bit too
maybe<00:03:05.700> a<00:03:05.820> warrant<00:03:06.600> out<00:03:06.660> some<00:03:06.870> of<00:03:06.959> the<00:03:07.050> errors

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:07.380 
maybe a warrant out some of the errors

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:10.040 
maybe a warrant out some of the errors
that<00:03:08.070> would<00:03:08.250> still<00:03:08.490> be<00:03:08.700> a<00:03:08.910> tremendous<00:03:09.360> speed

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:10.050 
that would still be a tremendous speed

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:12.140 
that would still be a tremendous speed
and<00:03:10.410> how<00:03:11.010> they<00:03:11.220> achieved<00:03:11.610> it<00:03:11.790> they<00:03:11.940> say

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150 
and how they achieved it they say

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.300 
and how they achieved it they say
basically<00:03:12.690> they<00:03:13.020> say<00:03:13.260> if<00:03:13.530> you<00:03:13.560> think<00:03:13.740> about<00:03:14.130> a

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310 
basically they say if you think about a

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:17.210 
basically they say if you think about a
highway<00:03:15.060> and<00:03:15.780> it<00:03:15.930> has<00:03:16.110> several<00:03:16.500> lanes<00:03:16.860> of

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
highway and it has several lanes of

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:19.880 
highway and it has several lanes of
traffic<00:03:17.450> what<00:03:18.450> they've<00:03:18.690> basically<00:03:18.959> done<00:03:19.590> is

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:19.890 
traffic what they've basically done is

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:23.060 
traffic what they've basically done is
been<00:03:20.880> able<00:03:21.060> to<00:03:21.450> compress<00:03:22.140> the<00:03:22.500> lanes<00:03:22.769> of

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:23.070 
been able to compress the lanes of

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:25.790 
been able to compress the lanes of
traffic<00:03:23.360> so<00:03:24.360> that<00:03:24.600> they<00:03:24.780> can<00:03:24.959> have<00:03:24.989> a<00:03:25.170> lot<00:03:25.530> more

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:25.800 
traffic so that they can have a lot more

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:29.390 
traffic so that they can have a lot more
lanes<00:03:26.190> in<00:03:26.550> the<00:03:27.180> existing<00:03:27.750> cables<00:03:28.260> so<00:03:29.070> that's

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:29.400 
lanes in the existing cables so that's

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:31.100 
lanes in the existing cables so that's
how<00:03:29.580> they<00:03:29.730> compared<00:03:30.150> it<00:03:30.300> if<00:03:30.420> you<00:03:30.750> want<00:03:30.930> to<00:03:30.989> read

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:31.110 
how they compared it if you want to read
