00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
Hulk Buster and I think they're both

Hulk Buster and I think they're both
pretty<00:00:24.510> cool<00:00:24.869> here<00:00:25.470> is<00:00:25.500> Hulk<00:00:26.160> first<00:00:26.760> and<00:00:27.240> he's

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
pretty cool here is Hulk first and he's

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:29.689 
pretty cool here is Hulk first and he's
kind<00:00:28.199> of<00:00:28.260> hard<00:00:28.500> to<00:00:28.590> get<00:00:28.830> to<00:00:29.010> stand<00:00:29.310> you<00:00:29.490> have<00:00:29.640> to

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
kind of hard to get to stand you have to

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.820 
kind of hard to get to stand you have to
put<00:00:30.029> his<00:00:30.179> legs<00:00:30.420> in<00:00:30.630> this<00:00:30.779> position<00:00:31.349> for<00:00:31.590> him<00:00:31.679> to

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
put his legs in this position for him to

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.729 
put his legs in this position for him to
actually<00:00:32.009> stand<00:00:32.520> up<00:00:32.700> or<00:00:32.940> he<00:00:33.030> just<00:00:33.270> falls<00:00:33.510> over

00:00:33.729 --> 00:00:33.739 
actually stand up or he just falls over

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:36.410 
actually stand up or he just falls over
so<00:00:34.739> I'm<00:00:34.860> kind<00:00:35.070> of<00:00:35.130> not<00:00:35.309> gonna<00:00:35.579> wanna<00:00:35.820> move<00:00:36.239> his

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
so I'm kind of not gonna wanna move his

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.930 
so I'm kind of not gonna wanna move his
legs<00:00:36.660> much<00:00:36.930> the<00:00:37.829> only<00:00:37.920> articulation<00:00:38.820> you've

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
legs much the only articulation you've

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.869 
legs much the only articulation you've
got<00:00:39.180> is<00:00:39.450> the<00:00:39.809> basic<00:00:40.559> leg<00:00:40.800> joints<00:00:41.250> and<00:00:41.399> arm

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
got is the basic leg joints and arm

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:43.580 
got is the basic leg joints and arm
joints<00:00:42.360> right<00:00:42.510> here<00:00:42.809> and<00:00:43.050> then<00:00:43.170> his<00:00:43.379> head

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
joints right here and then his head

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.610 
joints right here and then his head
moves<00:00:43.829> a<00:00:44.250> little<00:00:44.760> bit<00:00:44.910> so<00:00:45.840> not<00:00:46.140> a<00:00:46.170> whole<00:00:46.379> lot<00:00:46.590> of

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
moves a little bit so not a whole lot of

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.529 
moves a little bit so not a whole lot of
articulation<00:00:47.430> but<00:00:48.000> there<00:00:48.210> is<00:00:48.300> a<00:00:48.329> lot<00:00:48.510> of

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
articulation but there is a lot of

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:51.170 
articulation but there is a lot of
detailing<00:00:49.020> once<00:00:49.530> in<00:00:49.649> the<00:00:49.739> muscles<00:00:50.160> he's<00:00:50.940> got<00:00:51.149> a

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
detailing once in the muscles he's got a

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.049 
detailing once in the muscles he's got a
lot<00:00:51.420> of<00:00:51.449> detail<00:00:51.899> in<00:00:52.110> that<00:00:52.559> sense<00:00:52.860> so<00:00:53.730> I<00:00:53.760> think

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
lot of detail in that sense so I think

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.660 
lot of detail in that sense so I think
that<00:00:54.210> is<00:00:54.390> really<00:00:54.690> really<00:00:55.079> cool<00:00:55.289> and<00:00:55.640> you<00:00:56.640> can

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
that is really really cool and you can

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.790 
that is really really cool and you can
try<00:00:56.879> to<00:00:56.940> see<00:00:57.149> his<00:00:57.570> face<00:00:57.780> a<00:00:57.809> little<00:00:58.050> bit<00:00:58.260> it's

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
try to see his face a little bit it's

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.819 
try to see his face a little bit it's
got<00:00:58.920> a<00:00:58.980> really<00:00:59.160> tiny<00:00:59.460> head<00:00:59.789> hitting<00:01:00.750> me<00:01:00.870> um<00:01:01.469> so

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
got a really tiny head hitting me um so

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:05.509 
got a really tiny head hitting me um so
there's<00:01:02.579> both<00:01:03.270> and<00:01:03.600> then<00:01:03.840> Hulk<00:01:04.710> Buster<00:01:05.220> has

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
there's both and then Hulk Buster has

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.149 
there's both and then Hulk Buster has
even<00:01:06.030> less<00:01:06.240> articulation<00:01:06.990> he<00:01:07.560> basically<00:01:07.979> just

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
even less articulation he basically just

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:12.080 
even less articulation he basically just
can<00:01:08.640> move<00:01:08.820> his<00:01:08.939> arms<00:01:09.330> and<00:01:09.600> that's<00:01:10.260> it<00:01:10.590> and<00:01:11.090> also

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
can move his arms and that's it and also

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.899 
can move his arms and that's it and also
if<00:01:12.540> you<00:01:12.750> get<00:01:13.020> one<00:01:13.439> of<00:01:13.470> the<00:01:13.650> little<00:01:13.920> Iron<00:01:14.640> Man's

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
if you get one of the little Iron Man's

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.960 
if you get one of the little Iron Man's
that<00:01:15.869> is<00:01:16.020> small<00:01:16.470> enough<00:01:16.500> you<00:01:16.979> can<00:01:17.130> put<00:01:17.430> one

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
that is small enough you can put one

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.330 
that is small enough you can put one
inside<00:01:18.479> of<00:01:18.509> here<00:01:18.840> which<00:01:19.350> is<00:01:19.409> kind<00:01:19.770> of<00:01:19.860> cool<00:01:20.009> and

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
inside of here which is kind of cool and

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.880 
inside of here which is kind of cool and
open<00:01:20.729> it<00:01:20.820> up<00:01:20.939> and<00:01:21.150> put<00:01:21.840> an<00:01:21.930> Iron<00:01:22.170> Man<00:01:22.320> inside

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
open it up and put an Iron Man inside

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.370 
open it up and put an Iron Man inside
that's<00:01:23.549> pretty<00:01:23.850> neat<00:01:24.000> it<00:01:24.869> would<00:01:25.110> have<00:01:25.200> been<00:01:25.350> a

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
that's pretty neat it would have been a

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.530 
that's pretty neat it would have been a
lot<00:01:25.619> better<00:01:25.890> had<00:01:26.340> they<00:01:26.520> actually<00:01:26.939> included

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
lot better had they actually included

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.530 
lot better had they actually included
Iron<00:01:27.900> Man<00:01:28.140> which<00:01:28.920> is<00:01:28.950> what<00:01:29.220> I<00:01:29.430> was<00:01:30.060> hoping<00:01:30.270> for

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
Iron Man which is what I was hoping for

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.590 
Iron Man which is what I was hoping for
but<00:01:31.079> they<00:01:31.500> did<00:01:31.710> not<00:01:31.860> you<00:01:32.700> can't<00:01:32.939> move<00:01:33.150> the<00:01:33.360> legs

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
but they did not you can't move the legs

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.929 
but they did not you can't move the legs
at<00:01:33.810> all<00:01:34.020> but<00:01:34.979> it<00:01:35.189> does<00:01:35.310> have<00:01:35.549> some<00:01:35.790> nice

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
at all but it does have some nice

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:39.620 
at all but it does have some nice
detailing<00:01:36.479> on<00:01:36.720> it<00:01:37.159> and<00:01:38.159> for<00:01:38.670> only<00:01:38.790> $10<00:01:39.360> to<00:01:39.509> get

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
detailing on it and for only $10 to get

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.289 
detailing on it and for only $10 to get
both<00:01:39.810> of<00:01:39.960> these<00:01:40.079> is<00:01:40.320> not<00:01:40.530> too<00:01:40.740> bad<00:01:41.030> like<00:01:42.030> I<00:01:42.060> said

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.960 
both of these is not too bad like I said
really<00:01:42.689> nice<00:01:42.930> detailing<00:01:43.649> but<00:01:44.220> I<00:01:44.280> do<00:01:44.460> wish<00:01:44.759> they

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
had actually included the Iron Man to

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.990 
had actually included the Iron Man to
put<00:01:48.420> inside<00:01:48.930> of<00:01:48.990> here<00:01:49.579> right<00:01:50.579> there

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000
