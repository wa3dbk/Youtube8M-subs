 worth to use the hand the technician is more or less what is available in the store 

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:48.920

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:53.580
 to have originated from Gaelic football since the first experiments 

00:00:54.339 --> 00:00:55.690

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:31.060
 Brazil and Germany 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:32.970
 there comes the increase 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.970
 too delicate 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:38.540
 picture a man 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:39.620

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:50.270
 hand with him looks much faster than our football wants more is bigger 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:52.920
 for the track you have your left hand if you go 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.530
 pass the ball and some belongings 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.090
 troglodytes the Irish this morning 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:59.960
 - each side stay 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:04.690
 by the hand of disputing your room every four feet if there is that there is not to do

 some kind of action with the ball 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:11.010
 and it is this our side at the time of the goal warned both hands my penalty that 

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:12.140
 occupy your talent

 Madonna - Why It Happens

 she thought it was modern 

00:02:16.159 --> 00:02:20.469
 this explains that the new enem with a cheerful football many spend had done 

00:02:20.469 --> 00:02:23.969
 a match unless the regular football match lasted 60 minutes 

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:29.189
 while an official soccer field only 7 5 meters long 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:31.449
 the 70 wide 

00:02:31.449 --> 00:02:36.109

 by 80 meters wide a field of this size with the Chinese are also 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:46.590
 fifteen players on each side 

00:02:47.589 --> 00:02:52.379
 it was possible to form a band of mercenaries the goal for this mixture of 

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:56.739
 our football with an American football that pointed to the injury seems like 

00:02:56.739 --> 00:02:59.949
 basketball if the player wants to play with a kick the ball 

00:03:00.539 --> 00:03:03.039
 above the beam and worth a point 

00:03:03.039 --> 00:03:07.879
 if he hits the swinging nets as our malik three points 

00:03:07.879 --> 00:03:11.709
 participating in a football match is like this is a stimulating experience 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:15.939
 but my trip through the heart of Ireland still has other experiences 

00:03:15.939 --> 00:03:17.329
 that we have to know
