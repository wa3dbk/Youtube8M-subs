let's<00:00:33.030> see<00:00:33.330> I<00:00:34.550> don't<00:00:35.550> know<00:00:35.670> what<00:00:35.850> side<00:00:36.120> of<00:00:36.180> time

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
let's see I don't know what side of time

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.420 
let's see I don't know what side of time
I'm<00:00:36.960> second<00:00:38.780> right<00:00:39.780> there<00:00:40.130> when<00:00:41.130> we<00:00:41.310> were

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
I'm second right there when we were

july<00:01:06.499> but<00:01:07.499> basically<00:01:08.460> what<00:01:08.999> this<00:01:09.630> is<00:01:10.049> going<00:01:10.679> to

00:01:10.819 --> 00:01:10.829 
july but basically what this is going to

00:01:10.829 --> 00:01:15.830 
july but basically what this is going to
be<00:01:11.100> is<00:01:11.570> that<00:01:13.100> since<00:01:14.100> we<00:01:14.310> did<00:01:14.880> law<00:01:15.090> already<00:01:15.359> once

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
be is that since we did law already once

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.419 
be is that since we did law already once
we<00:01:16.049> fix<00:01:16.259> that<00:01:17.420> we<00:01:18.420> break<00:01:18.719> this<00:01:19.439> for<00:01:19.890> water<00:01:20.130> and

00:01:20.419 --> 00:01:20.429 
we fix that we break this for water and

00:01:20.429 --> 00:01:23.300 
we fix that we break this for water and
then<00:01:20.999> it<00:01:21.149> will<00:01:21.270> all<00:01:21.479> be<00:01:21.749> kabul<00:01:22.319> so<00:01:22.950> we<00:01:23.159> don't

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
then it will all be kabul so we don't

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.569 
then it will all be kabul so we don't
have<00:01:23.399> to<00:01:23.579> like<00:01:23.759> build<00:01:24.119> up<00:01:24.329> and<00:01:24.899> all<00:01:25.049> that<00:01:25.289> crap

00:01:25.569 --> 00:01:25.579 
have to like build up and all that crap

00:01:25.579 --> 00:01:29.599 
have to like build up and all that crap
it's<00:01:26.579> just<00:01:26.899> on<00:01:27.899> a<00:01:27.960> skull<00:01:28.499> food<00:01:28.829> showed<00:01:29.249> me<00:01:29.460> that

00:01:29.599 --> 00:01:29.609 
it's just on a skull food showed me that

00:01:29.609 --> 00:01:34.190 
it's just on a skull food showed me that
the<00:01:30.569> method<00:01:32.090> doesn't<00:01:33.090> look<00:01:33.329> too<00:01:33.539> hard<00:01:33.810> to<00:01:34.020> do

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
the method doesn't look too hard to do

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.669 
the method doesn't look too hard to do
and<00:01:34.710> it's<00:01:35.399> it's<00:01:35.999> pretty<00:01:36.509> easy<00:01:36.719> just<00:01:37.259> a<00:01:37.439> block

00:01:37.669 --> 00:01:37.679 
and it's it's pretty easy just a block

00:01:37.679 --> 00:01:44.270 
and it's it's pretty easy just a block
