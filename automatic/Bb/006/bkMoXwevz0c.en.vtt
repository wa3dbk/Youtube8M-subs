relatively fast the hard part is putting

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.120 
relatively fast the hard part is putting
in<00:00:33.660> the<00:00:33.809> screws<00:00:34.110> so<00:00:34.500> you<00:00:34.559> just<00:00:34.649> have<00:00:34.770> to<00:00:34.829> pour

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
in the screws so you just have to pour

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.400 
in the screws so you just have to pour
like<00:00:35.460> apply<00:00:36.210> pressure<00:00:36.630> to<00:00:36.870> this<00:00:37.110> and<00:00:37.320> then

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
like apply pressure to this and then

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.380 
like apply pressure to this and then
screw<00:00:37.739> it<00:00:37.860> in<00:00:38.040> and<00:00:38.309> eventually<00:00:38.910> they<00:00:39.030> go<00:00:39.210> in

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
screw it in and eventually they go in

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:40.850 
screw it in and eventually they go in
this<00:00:39.660> takes<00:00:39.870> a<00:00:39.989> while<00:00:40.140> so<00:00:40.379> once<00:00:40.530> you're<00:00:40.649> done
