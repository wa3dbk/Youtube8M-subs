Mac invited me to create a Polish range
for<00:00:21.720> them<00:00:21.960> I<00:00:22.170> wanted<00:00:22.529> to<00:00:22.680> do<00:00:22.800> something<00:00:23.070> that

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
for them I wanted to do something that

was<00:00:23.640> a<00:00:23.880> little<00:00:24.240> bit<00:00:24.510> different<00:00:24.750> I<00:00:25.170> had<00:00:25.650> an<00:00:25.769> idea

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
was a little bit different I had an idea

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.540 
was a little bit different I had an idea
of<00:00:26.699> putting<00:00:27.449> together<00:00:27.599> a<00:00:28.230> range<00:00:28.619> of<00:00:29.010> basically

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
of putting together a range of basically

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.150 
of putting together a range of basically
top<00:00:29.789> coats<00:00:30.060> for<00:00:30.539> transformers<00:00:31.260> if<00:00:31.560> you<00:00:31.920> take

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
top coats for transformers if you take

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.760 
top coats for transformers if you take
any<00:00:32.460> color<00:00:33.030> of<00:00:33.360> nail<00:00:33.690> polish<00:00:34.079> whether<00:00:34.410> it's<00:00:34.649> a

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
any color of nail polish whether it's a

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
dark color or whether it's a nude it

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:40.310 
dark color or whether it's a nude it
actually<00:00:37.460> transforms<00:00:38.460> the<00:00:38.640> color<00:00:38.910> and<00:00:39.540> most

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
actually transforms the color and most

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:41.720 
actually transforms the color and most
of<00:00:40.500> the<00:00:40.590> time<00:00:40.829> when<00:00:41.040> you<00:00:41.129> put<00:00:41.280> them<00:00:41.430> on<00:00:41.520> you're

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.500 
not actually quite sure what it's going
to<00:00:43.230> do<00:00:43.440> so<00:00:43.950> sometimes<00:00:44.820> it's<00:00:45.030> quite<00:00:45.180> a<00:00:45.270> nice

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
to do so sometimes it's quite a nice

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
actually mix the two and then you'd

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.510

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
got a very delicate texture to it just a

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:37.850 
got a very delicate texture to it just a
little<00:01:36.780> bit<00:01:36.900> more<00:01:37.049> chic<00:01:37.409> than<00:01:37.680> our

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
little bit more chic than our

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.460 
little bit more chic than our
traditional<00:01:38.100> matte<00:01:38.790> and<00:01:39.329> if<00:01:39.659> I<00:01:39.930> take<00:01:40.259> for

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
traditional matte and if I take for

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.880 
traditional matte and if I take for
example<00:01:40.500> the<00:01:41.310> bold<00:01:41.610> opal<00:01:42.450> get<00:01:43.110> nearly<00:01:43.560> all<00:01:43.860> of

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
example the bold opal get nearly all of

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.290 
example the bold opal get nearly all of
the<00:01:44.189> polish<00:01:44.520> off<00:01:44.729> the<00:01:44.970> brow

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:45.300 
the polish off the brow

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:48.170 
the polish off the brow
so<00:01:45.480> it's<00:01:45.660> virtually<00:01:45.870> a<00:01:46.440> dry<00:01:46.830> brush<00:01:47.130> and<00:01:47.580> then

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
so it's virtually a dry brush and then

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.590 
so it's virtually a dry brush and then
just<00:01:48.420> very<00:01:48.630> lightly<00:01:49.700> slicked<00:01:50.700> back<00:01:50.730> over<00:01:51.480> the

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
just very lightly slicked back over the

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.440 
just very lightly slicked back over the
surface<00:01:52.230> of<00:01:52.560> the<00:01:52.830> leather<00:01:53.100> you<00:01:53.940> sort<00:01:54.180> of<00:01:54.210> get

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
surface of the leather you sort of get

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.290 
surface of the leather you sort of get
an<00:01:54.600> antique<00:01:55.350> leather<00:01:55.710> look<00:01:56.010> you<00:01:56.850> can<00:01:57.090> layer

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:57.300 
an antique leather look you can layer

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:59.150

concept<00:02:02.010> but<00:02:02.460> I<00:02:02.520> think<00:02:02.790> it's<00:02:02.940> such<00:02:03.120> an

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
concept but I think it's such an

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.060 
concept but I think it's such an
effective<00:02:03.720> one<00:02:03.870> you<00:02:04.500> get<00:02:04.680> all<00:02:04.920> those

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
effective one you get all those

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.040 
effective one you get all those
different<00:02:05.310> effects<00:02:05.910> with<00:02:06.450> just<00:02:06.630> a<00:02:06.720> few<00:02:06.840> top

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:07.050 
different effects with just a few top

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:09.740 
different effects with just a few top
focus<00:02:07.440> I<00:02:07.680> absolutely<00:02:08.400> love<00:02:08.820> them<00:02:09.090> I<00:02:09.420> think

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
focus I absolutely love them I think

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:15.110
