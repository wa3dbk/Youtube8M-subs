after my past video I decided to show
you<00:00:05.580> what<00:00:05.940> frame<00:00:06.210> rate<00:00:06.390> I<00:00:06.600> get<00:00:06.930> by<00:00:07.290> using<00:00:07.859> these

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.010 
you what frame rate I get by using these

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:10.640 
you what frame rate I get by using these
options<00:00:08.220> and<00:00:08.760> if<00:00:09.450> you<00:00:09.510> go<00:00:09.599> to<00:00:09.690> my<00:00:09.809> channel<00:00:10.019> in

the information you will see my specs so
it's<00:00:13.170> something<00:00:13.349> like<00:00:13.469> that<00:00:13.830> you'll<00:00:14.700> see<00:00:15.000> the

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
it's something like that you'll see the

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:17.779 
it's something like that you'll see the
difference<00:00:15.599> now<00:00:15.870> with<00:00:16.859> the<00:00:17.160> recording<00:00:17.640> my

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
difference now with the recording my

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:19.760 
difference now with the recording my
favor<00:00:18.000> will<00:00:18.240> be<00:00:18.420> as<00:00:18.510> high<00:00:18.690> as<00:00:18.720> it<00:00:19.289> usually<00:00:19.410> is

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
favor will be as high as it usually is

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.790 
favor will be as high as it usually is
but<00:00:20.539> I'll<00:00:21.539> just<00:00:21.600> show<00:00:21.930> you<00:00:22.140> some<00:00:22.439> gameplay<00:00:22.619> I

but I'll just show you some gameplay I

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.269 
but I'll just show you some gameplay I
guess<00:00:23.130> uh-huh<00:00:24.090> I<00:00:24.480> got<00:00:25.470> this<00:00:25.619> game<00:00:25.859> a<00:00:25.890> couple

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
guess uh-huh I got this game a couple

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:28.550

days<00:00:26.430> ago<00:00:26.609> it's<00:00:27.090> been<00:00:27.269> really<00:00:27.449> fun<00:00:27.750> I<00:00:28.109> wish<00:00:28.410> I

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
days ago it's been really fun I wish I

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.250 
days ago it's been really fun I wish I
had<00:00:28.800> Scarab<00:00:29.310> but<00:00:29.580> I<00:00:29.849> really<00:00:30.779> doubt<00:00:30.960> that<00:00:30.990> would

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
had Scarab but I really doubt that would

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:32.209 
had Scarab but I really doubt that would
play<00:00:31.470> on<00:00:31.500> my<00:00:31.710> computer

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
play on my computer

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:35.180 
play on my computer
I've<00:00:32.730> tried<00:00:33.210> it<00:00:33.390> before<00:00:33.630> with<00:00:34.320> older

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
I've tried it before with older

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:36.620 
I've tried it before with older
computers<00:00:35.640> and<00:00:35.940> they<00:00:36.000> just<00:00:36.180> haven't<00:00:36.480> turned

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
computers and they just haven't turned

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:37.310 
computers and they just haven't turned
out<00:00:36.870> great

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
out great

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.350 
out great
and<00:00:37.410> I<00:00:38.160> mean<00:00:38.309> there's<00:00:38.520> the<00:00:38.670> older<00:00:39.059> ones<00:00:39.239> like

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
and I mean there's the older ones like

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.600 
and I mean there's the older ones like
morrowind<00:00:39.780> daggerfall<00:00:40.739> arena<00:00:41.190> but<00:00:41.370> I<00:00:41.430> don't

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
morrowind daggerfall arena but I don't

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:42.830 
morrowind daggerfall arena but I don't
really<00:00:41.730> like<00:00:41.820> those<00:00:42.149> that<00:00:42.300> much

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
really like those that much

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.069 
really like those that much
I<00:00:42.870> think<00:00:43.200> Oblivion's<00:00:43.739> nice<00:00:44.730> one<00:00:44.940> for<00:00:45.180> it<00:00:45.300> now

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
I think Oblivion's nice one for it now

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:47.900 
I think Oblivion's nice one for it now
I'm<00:00:46.559> out<00:00:46.739> in<00:00:46.770> the<00:00:46.890> open<00:00:46.980> world<00:00:47.340> so<00:00:47.640> I'm<00:00:47.820> not

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
I'm out in the open world so I'm not

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.160 
I'm out in the open world so I'm not
really<00:00:48.120> getting<00:00:48.360> that<00:00:48.450> great<00:00:48.690> of<00:00:48.870> a<00:00:48.960> frame

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
really getting that great of a frame

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.639 
really getting that great of a frame
rate<00:00:49.410> but<00:00:50.219> uh<00:00:50.250> I<00:00:50.670> were<00:00:50.910> to<00:00:51.059> go<00:00:51.899> inside

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
rate but uh I were to go inside

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.880 
rate but uh I were to go inside
somewhere<00:00:53.520> on<00:00:54.360> the<00:00:54.449> wire<00:00:54.660> then<00:00:55.170> my<00:00:55.469> frame<00:00:55.680> rate

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
somewhere on the wire then my frame rate

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.790 
somewhere on the wire then my frame rate
would<00:00:56.100> boost<00:00:56.699> a<00:00:57.120> lot<00:00:57.989> higher<00:00:58.170> than<00:00:58.199> it<00:00:58.680> is

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
would boost a lot higher than it is

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.060 
would boost a lot higher than it is
right<00:00:58.920> now<00:00:59.070> uh<00:00:59.809> plums<00:01:00.809> can<00:01:01.050> keep<00:01:01.230> wandering<00:01:01.590> in

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
right now uh plums can keep wandering in

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.189 
right now uh plums can keep wandering in
this<00:01:02.190> general<00:01:02.550> direction

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:05.199 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:11.010 

don't<00:01:05.619> abuse<00:01:05.890> West<00:01:06.670> I<00:01:07.060> guess<00:01:08.009> um<00:01:09.299> but<00:01:10.299> yes<00:01:10.600> he

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:11.020 
don't abuse West I guess um but yes he

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:15.240 
don't abuse West I guess um but yes he
feels<00:01:12.009> my<00:01:12.280> options<00:01:12.790> I<00:01:13.619> have<00:01:14.619> the<00:01:14.740> resolution

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:15.250 
feels my options I have the resolution

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:16.410 
feels my options I have the resolution
as<00:01:15.369> low<00:01:15.520> as<00:01:15.640> possible

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:16.420 
as low as possible

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:18.570 
as low as possible
brightness<00:01:16.930> at<00:01:17.290> medium<00:01:17.799> texture<00:01:18.250> size<00:01:18.369> at

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:18.580 
brightness at medium texture size at

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:20.940 
brightness at medium texture size at
large<00:01:19.119> I<00:01:19.149> have<00:01:19.780> everything<00:01:20.259> kind<00:01:20.530> of<00:01:20.710> in<00:01:20.830> the

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:20.950 
large I have everything kind of in the

large I have everything kind of in the
middle<00:01:21.130> distant<00:01:22.030> land<00:01:22.210> off<00:01:22.479> the<00:01:23.470> shadows<00:01:23.920> are

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:24.130 
middle distant land off the shadows are

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:28.320 
middle distant land off the shadows are
off<00:01:24.960> the<00:01:25.960> specular<00:01:26.680> dist<00:01:26.920> is<00:01:27.100> off<00:01:27.330> Lighting's

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:28.330 
off the specular dist is off Lighting's

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:30.630 
off the specular dist is off Lighting's
off<00:01:28.509> water<00:01:28.960> details<00:01:29.439> are<00:01:29.619> normal<00:01:29.950> so<00:01:30.549> if

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:30.640 
off water details are normal so if

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:32.340 
off water details are normal so if
there's<00:01:30.850> no<00:01:30.970> little<00:01:31.270> feature<00:01:31.450> everything

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:32.350 
there's no little feature everything

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:35.880 
there's no little feature everything
else<00:01:32.500> is<00:01:32.619> just<00:01:32.649> off<00:01:33.180> but<00:01:34.180> uh<00:01:34.210> I<00:01:34.689> mean<00:01:35.530> if<00:01:35.740> you

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:35.890 
else is just off but uh I mean if you

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:37.529 
else is just off but uh I mean if you
had<00:01:36.009> a<00:01:36.039> better<00:01:36.189> computer<00:01:36.640> than<00:01:36.789> my<00:01:37.060> head<00:01:37.300> I

00:01:37.529 --> 00:01:37.539 
had a better computer than my head I

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:39.359 
had a better computer than my head I
mean<00:01:37.720> I<00:01:37.780> have<00:01:37.899> a<00:01:37.960> laptop<00:01:38.409> so<00:01:38.590> obviously<00:01:38.979> it's

00:01:39.359 --> 00:01:39.369 
mean I have a laptop so obviously it's

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:41.490 
mean I have a laptop so obviously it's
not<00:01:39.490> going<00:01:39.610> to<00:01:39.700> be<00:01:39.759> that<00:01:39.909> great<00:01:40.179> but<00:01:40.990> uh<00:01:41.020> a<00:01:41.319> lot

of you should be able to hand better

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:47.430 
of you should be able to hand better
graphical<00:01:43.390> options<00:01:46.140> excuse<00:01:47.140> me

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:47.440 
graphical options excuse me

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:52.620 
graphical options excuse me
but<00:01:48.130> yeah<00:01:48.789> so<00:01:49.509> as<00:01:50.229> you<00:01:50.350> can<00:01:50.500> see<00:01:51.090> it<00:01:52.090> like<00:01:52.299> you

00:01:53.699 --> 00:01:53.709 
get a little bit of lag when it loads

00:01:53.709 --> 00:01:56.399 
get a little bit of lag when it loads
but<00:01:54.069> I'm<00:01:54.369> getting<00:01:54.700> around<00:01:55.119> 10<00:01:55.450> frames<00:01:55.840> right

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:56.409 
but I'm getting around 10 frames right

00:01:56.409 --> 00:01:58.889

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:16.040 
a lot better than I thought it would

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:18.430 
a lot better than I thought it would
turn<00:03:16.250> out<00:03:16.400> the<00:03:16.670> perhaps<00:03:17.230> since<00:03:18.230> usually
