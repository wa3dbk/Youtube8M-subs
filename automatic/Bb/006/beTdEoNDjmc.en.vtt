00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
life rather than that coil spring having

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:51.640 
life rather than that coil spring having
the<00:02:50.129> tendency<00:02:50.579> to<00:02:50.609> maybe<00:02:50.819> break<00:02:51.180> over<00:02:51.450> time

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:51.650 
the tendency to maybe break over time
