the<00:00:47.239> day<00:00:47.420> we<00:00:47.660> had<00:00:47.780> pretty<00:00:48.080> high<00:00:48.290> hopes<00:00:48.730> got<00:00:49.730> out

00:00:49.869 --> 00:00:49.879 
the day we had pretty high hopes got out

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:51.369 
the day we had pretty high hopes got out
there<00:00:50.059> and<00:00:50.120> the<00:00:50.300> fish<00:00:50.570> just<00:00:50.870> weren't<00:00:51.080> really

00:00:51.369 --> 00:00:51.379 
there and the fish just weren't really

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:53.950 
there and the fish just weren't really
that<00:00:51.620> active<00:00:52.100> it<00:00:52.580> was<00:00:52.760> a<00:00:53.120> little<00:00:53.390> bit<00:00:53.570> slow<00:00:53.930> for

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:53.960 
that active it was a little bit slow for

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:55.689 
that active it was a little bit slow for
the<00:00:54.230> probably<00:00:54.920> the<00:00:55.010> first<00:00:55.160> half<00:00:55.430> of<00:00:55.580> the<00:00:55.670> day

00:00:55.689 --> 00:00:55.699 
the probably the first half of the day

00:00:55.699 --> 00:00:58.869 
the probably the first half of the day
and<00:00:56.710> we<00:00:57.710> started<00:00:58.010> seeing<00:00:58.070> a<00:00:58.220> few<00:00:58.400> fish<00:00:58.580> roll<00:00:58.850> I

00:00:58.869 --> 00:00:58.879 
and we started seeing a few fish roll I

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:01.119 
and we started seeing a few fish roll I
think<00:00:59.210> Jim<00:00:59.360> got<00:00:59.540> a<00:00:59.570> hookup<00:00:59.960> Joe<00:01:00.710> had<00:01:00.890> a<00:01:00.920> couple

00:01:01.119 --> 00:01:01.129 
think Jim got a hookup Joe had a couple

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:04.359 
think Jim got a hookup Joe had a couple
of<00:01:01.250> hits<00:01:01.460> but<00:01:02.390> I<00:01:02.750> hadn't<00:01:03.680> gotten<00:01:03.800> hit<00:01:04.070> since

00:01:04.359 --> 00:01:04.369 
of hits but I hadn't gotten hit since

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:06.249 
of hits but I hadn't gotten hit since
early<00:01:04.670> in<00:01:04.699> the<00:01:04.820> morning<00:01:05.180> so<00:01:05.360> I<00:01:05.540> decided<00:01:05.990> to<00:01:06.110> go

00:01:06.249 --> 00:01:06.259 
early in the morning so I decided to go

00:01:06.259 --> 00:01:08.260 
early in the morning so I decided to go
over<00:01:06.440> to<00:01:06.619> the<00:01:06.710> mangroves<00:01:07.100> and<00:01:07.340> catch<00:01:07.820> a<00:01:07.910> snook

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:08.270 
over to the mangroves and catch a snook

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:10.749 
over to the mangroves and catch a snook
and<00:01:08.540> I<00:01:09.290> left<00:01:09.500> my<00:01:09.649> perch<00:01:09.920> out<00:01:10.220> you<00:01:10.670> know

00:01:10.749 --> 00:01:10.759 
and I left my perch out you know

00:01:10.759 --> 00:01:12.910 
and I left my perch out you know
drifting<00:01:11.270> hoping<00:01:12.259> maybe<00:01:12.380> to<00:01:12.530> pick<00:01:12.710> up<00:01:12.830> a

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:12.920 
drifting hoping maybe to pick up a

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:16.030 
drifting hoping maybe to pick up a
tarpon<00:01:13.310> and<00:01:13.520> I<00:01:14.479> got<00:01:14.930> up<00:01:15.080> into<00:01:15.320> some<00:01:15.500> branches

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:16.040 
tarpon and I got up into some branches

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:19.300 
tarpon and I got up into some branches
was<00:01:16.550> casting<00:01:17.060> at<00:01:17.180> the<00:01:17.270> mangroves<00:01:17.810> and<00:01:18.140> all<00:01:19.100> of

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:19.310 
was casting at the mangroves and all of

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:21.400 
was casting at the mangroves and all of
a<00:01:19.369> sudden<00:01:19.399> I<00:01:19.759> felt<00:01:19.970> my<00:01:20.330> mic<00:01:20.810> was<00:01:21.020> completely

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:21.410 
a sudden I felt my mic was completely

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:23.200 
a sudden I felt my mic was completely
sideways<00:01:21.710> to<00:01:22.100> the<00:01:22.130> line<00:01:22.399> that<00:01:22.520> I<00:01:22.580> had<00:01:22.820> out<00:01:23.030> and

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:23.210 
sideways to the line that I had out and

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:24.700 
sideways to the line that I had out and
I<00:01:23.240> felt<00:01:23.479> the<00:01:23.570> thing<00:01:23.750> wobble<00:01:24.170> I<00:01:24.259> thought<00:01:24.440> I<00:01:24.470> had

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:24.710 
I felt the thing wobble I thought I had

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:27.520 
I felt the thing wobble I thought I had
hit<00:01:25.160> a<00:01:25.190> stump<00:01:25.580> and<00:01:25.790> then<00:01:26.600> the<00:01:26.720> big<00:01:26.869> splash<00:01:27.080> came

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:27.530 
hit a stump and then the big splash came

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:30.670 
hit a stump and then the big splash came
and<00:01:27.890> it<00:01:28.190> was<00:01:28.220> a<00:01:28.399> big<00:01:28.700> old<00:01:28.850> fish<00:01:29.149> and<00:01:29.590> right<00:01:30.590> away

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:30.680 
and it was a big old fish and right away

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:32.020 
and it was a big old fish and right away
my<00:01:30.920> first<00:01:31.160> concern<00:01:31.369> was<00:01:31.550> we<00:01:31.789> were<00:01:31.880> in<00:01:31.940> the

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:32.030 
my first concern was we were in the

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:33.340 
my first concern was we were in the
branches<00:01:32.450> you<00:01:32.509> know<00:01:32.690> got<00:01:32.869> to<00:01:32.930> get<00:01:33.050> this<00:01:33.140> fish

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:33.350 
branches you know got to get this fish

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:34.779 
branches you know got to get this fish
out<00:01:33.530> of<00:01:33.649> these<00:01:33.770> branches<00:01:34.009> I<00:01:34.340> could<00:01:34.490> feel<00:01:34.640> the

00:01:34.779 --> 00:01:34.789 
out of these branches I could feel the

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:36.370 
out of these branches I could feel the
line<00:01:34.970> was<00:01:35.180> wrapped<00:01:35.390> around<00:01:35.510> the<00:01:35.780> branch<00:01:36.020> or

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:36.380 
line was wrapped around the branch or

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:38.620 
line was wrapped around the branch or
rub<00:01:36.740> it<00:01:36.830> up<00:01:36.890> against<00:01:37.250> the<00:01:37.280> branch<00:01:37.580> but<00:01:38.450> um

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:38.630 
rub it up against the branch but um

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:41.469 
rub it up against the branch but um
second<00:01:39.560> jump<00:01:39.799> cleared<00:01:40.070> the<00:01:40.190> branch<00:01:40.460> and<00:01:40.790> we're

00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:41.479 
second jump cleared the branch and we're

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:43.000 
second jump cleared the branch and we're
able<00:01:41.600> to<00:01:41.750> fight<00:01:41.990> the<00:01:42.140> fish<00:01:42.290> out<00:01:42.470> of<00:01:42.530> there<00:01:42.799> and

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:43.010 
able to fight the fish out of there and

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:45.520 
able to fight the fish out of there and
then<00:01:43.250> the<00:01:43.520> next<00:01:43.549> to<00:01:44.030> two<00:01:44.810> and<00:01:44.930> a<00:01:44.960> half<00:01:45.080> hours

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:45.530 
then the next to two and a half hours

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:48.429 
then the next to two and a half hours
was<00:01:46.030> the<00:01:47.030> fish<00:01:47.240> just<00:01:47.479> telling<00:01:47.780> me<00:01:47.900> around<00:01:48.229> it

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:48.439 
was the fish just telling me around it

00:01:48.439 --> 00:01:50.950 
was the fish just telling me around it
at<00:01:48.650> points<00:01:49.369> 2<00:01:49.460> times<00:01:49.700> telling<00:01:50.150> me<00:01:50.299> and<00:01:50.479> jim<00:01:50.689> and

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:50.960 
at points 2 times telling me and jim and

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:53.440 
at points 2 times telling me and jim and
joe<00:01:51.170> around<00:01:51.530> just<00:01:52.369> a<00:01:52.460> super<00:01:52.790> powerful<00:01:53.060> fish

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:53.450 
joe around just a super powerful fish

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:57.010 
joe around just a super powerful fish
just<00:01:53.810> awesome<00:01:54.970> now<00:01:55.970> we<00:01:56.150> got<00:01:56.299> Luther<00:01:56.659> hooked<00:01:56.840> up

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:57.020 
just awesome now we got Luther hooked up

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:58.929 
just awesome now we got Luther hooked up
with<00:01:57.200> a<00:01:57.229> reel<00:01:57.619> big<00:01:57.830> fish<00:01:57.890> I<00:01:58.310> think<00:01:58.549> he's<00:01:58.670> way

00:01:58.929 --> 00:01:58.939 
with a reel big fish I think he's way

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:00.999 
with a reel big fish I think he's way
over<00:01:59.240> a<00:01:59.270> hundred<00:01:59.659> fish<00:02:00.320> was<00:02:00.500> hooked<00:02:00.680> up<00:02:00.830> and

00:02:00.999 --> 00:02:01.009 
over a hundred fish was hooked up and

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:01.990 
over a hundred fish was hooked up and
probably<00:02:01.189> less<00:02:01.490> than<00:02:01.520> a<00:02:01.700> foot<00:02:01.880> of<00:02:01.909> water

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:02.000 
probably less than a foot of water
