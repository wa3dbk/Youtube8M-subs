really<00:02:33.160> too<00:02:33.370> bad<00:02:33.520> because<00:02:33.580> it<00:02:34.060> will<00:02:34.270> be<00:02:34.300> a<00:02:34.870> very

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
really too bad because it will be a very

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:37.830 
really too bad because it will be a very
good<00:02:35.620> card<00:02:36.070> and<00:02:36.400> if<00:02:36.520> I<00:02:36.640> do<00:02:36.700> end<00:02:37.210> up<00:02:37.330> using<00:02:37.540> him

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:47.170 
learn the cour together I really did I

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:50.570

think<00:02:47.350> is<00:02:47.410> a<00:02:47.440> cool<00:02:47.709> card<00:02:47.950> on<00:02:48.130> also<00:02:49.030> a<00:02:49.060> team<00:02:49.360> but

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:50.580 
think is a cool card on also a team but

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:53.760 
think is a cool card on also a team but
unfortunately<00:02:51.580> Cavani<00:02:52.360> is<00:02:52.750> going<00:02:53.050> to<00:02:53.320> win<00:02:53.530> the

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:53.770 
unfortunately Cavani is going to win the

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:57.240 
unfortunately Cavani is going to win the
vote<00:02:54.040> and<00:02:54.310> to<00:02:54.880> be<00:02:55.540> fair<00:02:55.810> it<00:02:56.380> looks<00:02:56.980> like<00:02:57.220> a

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:57.250 
vote and to be fair it looks like a

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:59.820 
vote and to be fair it looks like a
pretty<00:02:57.610> solid<00:02:58.000> card<00:02:58.390> and<00:02:58.690> I<00:02:58.870> don't<00:02:59.260> use<00:02:59.410> Cavani

00:02:59.820 --> 00:02:59.830 
pretty solid card and I don't use Cavani

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:01.710 
pretty solid card and I don't use Cavani
enough<00:03:00.130> so<00:03:00.310> maybe<00:03:00.459> this<00:03:00.610> will<00:03:00.730> be<00:03:00.760> a<00:03:01.090> pretty

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:01.720 
enough so maybe this will be a pretty

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:03.750 
enough so maybe this will be a pretty
solid<00:03:01.900> excuse<00:03:02.410> to<00:03:02.920> give<00:03:03.070> him<00:03:03.220> a<00:03:03.280> try<00:03:03.490> number

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:03.760 
solid excuse to give him a try number

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:06.170 
solid excuse to give him a try number
