00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.300 
or so I think by this point so my card
buffs<00:00:24.900> aren't<00:00:25.140> incredibly<00:00:25.590> insane<00:00:25.920> by<00:00:26.160> any

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
need to do this

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:40.760 
need to do this
it<00:00:39.540> just<00:00:39.780> it<00:00:39.960> gives<00:00:40.079> you<00:00:40.230> a<00:00:40.260> little<00:00:40.500> bit<00:00:40.620> of<00:00:40.649> an

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
it just it gives you a little bit of an

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.770 
it just it gives you a little bit of an
edge<00:00:40.920> but<00:00:41.190> it<00:00:41.309> is<00:00:41.460> by<00:00:41.730> no<00:00:41.790> means<00:00:41.940> necessary<00:00:42.719> to

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
edge but it is by no means necessary to

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:43.520 
edge but it is by no means necessary to
pull<00:00:43.020> it<00:00:43.140> off

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
pull it off

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.020 
pull it off
with<00:00:44.040> this<00:00:44.160> technique<00:00:44.489> I'm<00:00:44.610> gonna<00:00:44.730> be<00:00:44.850> showing

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
with this technique I'm gonna be showing

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.940 
with this technique I'm gonna be showing
you<00:00:45.210> and<00:00:45.480> then<00:00:45.930> for<00:00:46.110> my<00:00:46.170> extra<00:00:46.469> cards<00:00:46.710> I'm<00:00:46.829> not

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
you and then for my extra cards I'm not

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.380 
you and then for my extra cards I'm not
sure<00:00:47.100> what<00:00:47.219> you<00:00:47.280> call<00:00:47.460> those<00:00:47.579> my<00:00:47.730> power<00:00:47.940> cards

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
sure what you call those my power cards

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.080 
sure what you call those my power cards
I<00:00:48.930> use<00:00:49.469> Master<00:00:49.920> Shin<00:00:50.129> level<00:00:50.489> one<00:00:50.670> which<00:00:50.910> gives

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
I use Master Shin level one which gives

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:52.580 
I use Master Shin level one which gives
you<00:00:51.270> increase<00:00:51.600> fighting<00:00:51.989> in<00:00:52.079> the<00:00:52.170> air<00:00:52.320> and

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
you increase fighting in the air and

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.290 
you increase fighting in the air and
decrease<00:00:53.370> fighting<00:00:53.699> on<00:00:53.789> the<00:00:53.879> ground<00:00:54.120> I

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
decrease fighting on the ground I

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:55.580 
decrease fighting on the ground I
believe<00:00:54.570> that<00:00:54.719> this<00:00:54.780> helps<00:00:55.050> a<00:00:55.110> little<00:00:55.199> because

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
believe that this helps a little because

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:56.750 
believe that this helps a little because
when<00:00:55.770> you're<00:00:55.890> fighting<00:00:56.070> a<00:00:56.250> great<00:00:56.460> ape<00:00:56.579> you're

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
when you're fighting a great ape you're

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.130 
when you're fighting a great ape you're
probably<00:00:57.000> gonna<00:00:57.180> spend<00:00:57.360> most<00:00:57.600> your<00:00:57.719> time<00:00:57.870> in

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
probably gonna spend most your time in

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.209 
probably gonna spend most your time in
the<00:00:58.230> air<00:00:58.350> you<00:00:58.500> definitely<00:00:58.890> don't<00:00:59.010> wanna<00:00:59.129> be

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
the air you definitely don't wanna be

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.630

this<00:01:08.520> is<00:01:08.670> a<00:01:08.700> guide<00:01:08.939> for<00:01:09.360> playing<00:01:09.630> by<00:01:09.780> yourself

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
this is a guide for playing by yourself

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.469 
this is a guide for playing by yourself
not<00:01:10.890> in<00:01:11.100> co-op<00:01:11.430> mode<00:01:11.460> I'm<00:01:11.760> at<00:01:11.909> I'm<00:01:12.060> assuming

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
not in co-op mode I'm at I'm assuming

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.090 
not in co-op mode I'm at I'm assuming
it's<00:01:12.600> gonna<00:01:12.720> be<00:01:12.869> harder<00:01:13.110> to<00:01:13.140> get<00:01:13.350> a<00:01:13.380> SS<00:01:13.830> rank

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
it's gonna be harder to get a SS rank

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.850 
it's gonna be harder to get a SS rank
when<00:01:14.729> you're<00:01:14.850> playing<00:01:15.060> by<00:01:15.240> yourself<00:01:15.630> but<00:01:16.500> none

fast-forward and stuff like that that's

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.600 
fast-forward and stuff like that that's
just<00:01:27.900> to<00:01:28.020> save<00:01:28.229> time<00:01:28.439> really<00:01:28.770> but<00:01:29.400> once<00:01:29.549> you

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
just to save time really but once you

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:30.859

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
regular vegeta mode so the first thing

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:33.499 
regular vegeta mode so the first thing
you're<00:01:32.400> gonna<00:01:32.460> want<00:01:32.729> to<00:01:32.759> do<00:01:32.880> is<00:01:33.030> push<00:01:33.240> right<00:01:33.450> on

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
the directional on the directional pad

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:36.770 
the directional on the directional pad
now<00:01:35.579> what<00:01:35.700> this<00:01:35.790> is<00:01:35.939> gonna<00:01:36.060> do<00:01:36.299> is<00:01:36.570> it's<00:01:36.600> gonna

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
now what this is gonna do is it's gonna

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.420 
now what this is gonna do is it's gonna
tell<00:01:37.079> your<00:01:37.170> team<00:01:37.320> to<00:01:37.470> focus<00:01:37.799> all<00:01:37.950> your<00:01:38.070> powers

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
together and focusing your powers

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:41.630 
together and focusing your powers
together<00:01:40.619> is<00:01:40.799> gonna<00:01:40.920> be<00:01:41.100> important<00:01:41.460> because

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
Vegeta your energy meter at the top is

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.319 
Vegeta your energy meter at the top is
gonna<00:01:47.070> fill<00:01:47.340> up<00:01:47.520> and<00:01:47.700> you<00:01:47.880> want<00:01:48.060> to<00:01:48.149> chain

majeeda until you get enough energy to

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.010 
majeeda until you get enough energy to
do<00:01:50.040> a<00:01:50.070> super<00:01:50.430> attack<00:01:50.490> which<00:01:50.909> as<00:01:51.540> long<00:01:51.780> as<00:01:51.930> you

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
hit a max chain early on you're gonna

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.399 
hit a max chain early on you're gonna
get<00:01:53.640> once<00:01:54.299> you<00:01:54.420> have<00:01:54.540> your<00:01:54.630> super<00:01:54.960> attack<00:01:55.200> it's

up<00:01:55.530> to<00:01:55.649> you<00:01:55.799> you<00:01:55.950> can<00:01:56.070> either<00:01:56.189> continue

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
up to you you can either continue

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.100 
up to you you can either continue
chaining<00:01:57.030> Vegeta<00:01:57.360> however<00:01:57.719> this<00:01:57.840> is<00:01:57.960> gonna

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
chaining Vegeta however this is gonna

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:59.690 
chaining Vegeta however this is gonna
add<00:01:58.290> more<00:01:58.530> to<00:01:58.590> your<00:01:58.649> time<00:01:58.979> that's<00:01:59.490> not

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
add more to your time that's not

add more to your time that's not
necessarily<00:02:00.270> a<00:02:00.390> bad<00:02:00.450> thing<00:02:00.630> as<00:02:01.020> long<00:02:01.409> as<00:02:01.590> your

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
necessarily a bad thing as long as your

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:04.310 
necessarily a bad thing as long as your
energy<00:02:01.950> meter<00:02:02.310> rises<00:02:02.700> pretty<00:02:02.939> quickly<00:02:03.320> you

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
energy meter rises pretty quickly you

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.499 
energy meter rises pretty quickly you
can<00:02:05.219> either<00:02:05.369> continue<00:02:05.490> to<00:02:05.820> chamber<00:02:06.149> Judah<00:02:06.360> or

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
can either continue to chamber Judah or

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:07.639 
can either continue to chamber Judah or
you<00:02:06.630> can<00:02:06.750> just<00:02:06.930> try<00:02:07.020> to<00:02:07.079> take<00:02:07.259> them<00:02:07.409> out<00:02:07.500> right

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
you can just try to take them out right

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:08.869 
you can just try to take them out right
away<00:02:07.890> once<00:02:08.160> you've<00:02:08.310> pushed<00:02:08.489> right<00:02:08.670> on<00:02:08.789> the

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
away once you've pushed right on the

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:10.460 
away once you've pushed right on the
d-pad<00:02:09.060> and<00:02:09.420> you're<00:02:09.509> all<00:02:09.629> focusing<00:02:10.080> Vegeta

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
d-pad and you're all focusing Vegeta

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:11.809 
d-pad and you're all focusing Vegeta
which<00:02:10.619> I<00:02:10.739> actually<00:02:10.890> haven't<00:02:11.250> done<00:02:11.370> here<00:02:11.670> yet

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
which I actually haven't done here yet

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:12.830 
which I actually haven't done here yet

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
and it's still going very well there you

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:13.520 
and it's still going very well there you
go<00:02:12.870> I<00:02:12.959> just<00:02:13.170> did<00:02:13.319> it

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
go I just did it

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.800 
go I just did it
but<00:02:14.520> once<00:02:14.670> you're<00:02:14.760> all<00:02:14.880> focusing<00:02:15.300> vegeta<00:02:15.600> once

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
but once you're all focusing vegeta once

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:17.150 
but once you're all focusing vegeta once
y'all<00:02:15.959> trying<00:02:16.200> to<00:02:16.260> take<00:02:16.410> the<00:02:16.500> GT<00:02:16.709> out<00:02:16.740> he's<00:02:16.980> not

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
y'all trying to take the GT out he's not

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.400 
y'all trying to take the GT out he's not
gonna<00:02:17.340> last<00:02:17.610> much<00:02:17.850> longer<00:02:18.050> when<00:02:19.050> you<00:02:19.200> so

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
gonna last much longer when you so

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:21.770 
gonna last much longer when you so
choose<00:02:19.709> to<00:02:19.950> end<00:02:20.100> him<00:02:20.300> for<00:02:21.300> the<00:02:21.360> most<00:02:21.540> part

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
choose to end him for the most part

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:23.030 
choose to end him for the most part
because<00:02:21.930> your<00:02:22.170> teammates<00:02:22.470> once<00:02:22.740> you<00:02:22.860> tell

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
because your teammates once you tell

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:24.680 
because your teammates once you tell

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
them all to focus on one thing don't get

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:25.880 
them all to focus on one thing don't get
hit<00:02:24.810> by<00:02:24.840> a<00:02:24.959> Gallic<00:02:25.230> gun<00:02:25.350> in<00:02:25.440> the<00:02:25.500> face<00:02:25.680> by<00:02:25.860> the

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:27.630 
way that's not good you want to try to

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:28.309 
way that's not good you want to try to
avoid<00:02:27.840> those

00:02:28.309 --> 00:02:28.319 
avoid those

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:30.320 
avoid those
but<00:02:29.010> winter<00:02:29.220> once<00:02:29.490> your<00:02:29.610> entire<00:02:29.850> team<00:02:30.030> starts

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330 
but winter once your entire team starts

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:31.699 
but winter once your entire team starts
focusing<00:02:30.480> him<00:02:30.810> he's<00:02:30.959> not<00:02:31.110> gonna<00:02:31.260> last<00:02:31.470> much

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:31.709 
focusing him he's not gonna last much

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:33.170 
focusing him he's not gonna last much
longer<00:02:31.770> so<00:02:32.250> after<00:02:32.459> this<00:02:32.580> point<00:02:32.790> you<00:02:32.850> can<00:02:33.000> start

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
longer so after this point you can start

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:34.550 
longer so after this point you can start
firing<00:02:33.420> Kamehameha<00:02:33.959> waves<00:02:34.230> at<00:02:34.319> em<00:02:34.410> if<00:02:34.530> you

want or you can just beat him around a
bunch<00:02:36.239> it<00:02:36.630> doesn't<00:02:36.989> really<00:02:37.080> matter<00:02:37.290> just<00:02:37.410> so

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
bunch it doesn't really matter just so

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:40.160 
bunch it doesn't really matter just so
long<00:02:37.830> as<00:02:37.860> you<00:02:38.100> try<00:02:38.340> to<00:02:38.370> not<00:02:38.760> you<00:02:39.690> can<00:02:39.870> be<00:02:40.020> the

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
long as you try to not you can be the

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:41.780 
long as you try to not you can be the
focus<00:02:40.530> of<00:02:40.650> him<00:02:40.830> but<00:02:41.010> don't<00:02:41.250> be<00:02:41.370> taking<00:02:41.640> a<00:02:41.700> lot

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
focus of him but don't be taking a lot

of hits I took a Gallic gun to the face
earlier<00:02:43.380> that<00:02:43.650> wasn't<00:02:44.010> good<00:02:44.130> but<00:02:44.700> I've<00:02:44.819> hit

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910 
earlier that wasn't good but I've hit

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:47.050 
earlier that wasn't good but I've hit
him<00:02:45.030> with<00:02:45.150> a<00:02:45.180> couple<00:02:45.450> Kamehameha<00:02:45.900> waves<00:02:46.110> here

him with a couple Kamehameha waves here

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:50.000 
him with a couple Kamehameha waves here
and<00:02:48.060> he's<00:02:48.870> about<00:02:49.050> to<00:02:49.170> go<00:02:49.260> down<00:02:49.440> now<00:02:49.739> once<00:02:49.950> he

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
and he's about to go down now once he

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:51.590 
and he's about to go down now once he
goat<00:02:50.250> goes<00:02:50.730> down<00:02:50.940> and<00:02:51.090> goes<00:02:51.209> in<00:02:51.330> a<00:02:51.390> gray<00:02:51.540> day

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:51.600 
goat goes down and goes in a gray day

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.000 
goat goes down and goes in a gray day
for<00:02:51.870> him<00:02:51.959> that's<00:02:52.140> when<00:02:52.350> the<00:02:52.440> real<00:02:52.590> strategy

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
for him that's when the real strategy

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:54.500 
for him that's when the real strategy
comes<00:02:53.190> into<00:02:53.370> play<00:02:53.519> as<00:02:54.000> you<00:02:54.120> can<00:02:54.239> see<00:02:54.360> this

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
comes into play as you can see this

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:56.000 
comes into play as you can see this
isn't<00:02:54.810> even<00:02:54.870> a<00:02:55.050> very<00:02:55.230> good<00:02:55.410> run<00:02:55.560> for<00:02:55.800> me<00:02:55.890> I'm

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
isn't even a very good run for me I'm

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:58.040 
isn't even a very good run for me I'm
taking<00:02:56.370> hits<00:02:56.550> I'm<00:02:56.850> uh<00:02:56.910> I'm<00:02:57.510> being<00:02:57.720> kind<00:02:57.989> of

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:58.050 
taking hits I'm uh I'm being kind of

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:59.479 
taking hits I'm uh I'm being kind of
sloppy<00:02:58.260> I<00:02:58.410> got<00:02:58.590> hit<00:02:58.709> with<00:02:58.739> a<00:02:58.860> Gallic<00:02:59.160> gun<00:02:59.310> he

00:02:59.479 --> 00:02:59.489 
sloppy I got hit with a Gallic gun he

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:00.890 
sloppy I got hit with a Gallic gun he
started<00:02:59.819> to<00:02:59.880> chain<00:03:00.090> me<00:03:00.239> around<00:03:00.510> a<00:03:00.600> little<00:03:00.690> bit

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
started to chain me around a little bit

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:02.750 
started to chain me around a little bit
but<00:03:01.890> for<00:03:02.010> the<00:03:02.069> most<00:03:02.190> part<00:03:02.400> I'm<00:03:02.459> just<00:03:02.519> kind<00:03:02.730> of

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
but for the most part I'm just kind of

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.430 
but for the most part I'm just kind of
waiting<00:03:03.060> for<00:03:03.300> my<00:03:03.690> team<00:03:03.900> to<00:03:04.019> take<00:03:04.200> him<00:03:04.319> out<00:03:04.380> you

waiting for my team to take him out you

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:05.870 
waiting for my team to take him out you
can<00:03:04.739> do<00:03:04.860> that<00:03:05.040> if<00:03:05.280> you're<00:03:05.430> afraid<00:03:05.610> of<00:03:05.730> your

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:05.880 
can do that if you're afraid of your

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:07.220 
can do that if you're afraid of your
health<00:03:06.090> getting<00:03:06.360> too<00:03:06.480> low<00:03:06.630> or<00:03:06.780> something

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
health getting too low or something

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:09.050 
health getting too low or something
here<00:03:08.069> we're<00:03:08.160> gonna<00:03:08.280> see<00:03:08.459> another<00:03:08.670> sped<00:03:08.940> up

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
here we're gonna see another sped up

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:10.910 
here we're gonna see another sped up
cutscene<00:03:09.450> but<00:03:10.319> if<00:03:10.410> you're<00:03:10.530> afraid<00:03:10.680> of<00:03:10.769> your

health<00:03:11.100> getting<00:03:11.370> too<00:03:11.489> low<00:03:11.900> you<00:03:12.900> can<00:03:13.050> basically

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
health getting too low you can basically

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:14.930 
health getting too low you can basically
just<00:03:13.500> play<00:03:13.650> defense<00:03:14.040> just<00:03:14.250> hold<00:03:14.430> on<00:03:14.550> one<00:03:14.730> move

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:14.940 
just play defense just hold on one move

left and right dodges attacks and let

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:18.380 
left and right dodges attacks and let
your<00:03:17.160> teammates<00:03:17.489> take<00:03:17.670> him<00:03:17.790> out<00:03:17.940> if<00:03:18.060> that's<00:03:18.269> an

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:18.390 
your teammates take him out if that's an

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:20.060 
your teammates take him out if that's an
option<00:03:18.690> for<00:03:18.720> you<00:03:18.900> but<00:03:19.410> anyways<00:03:19.680> once<00:03:19.860> you<00:03:19.950> get

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:20.070 
option for you but anyways once you get

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:21.800 
option for you but anyways once you get
into<00:03:20.250> what<00:03:20.430> once<00:03:20.910> he<00:03:21.000> gets<00:03:21.150> into<00:03:21.269> gradate<00:03:21.630> mode

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:21.810 
into what once he gets into gradate mode

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:23.330 
into what once he gets into gradate mode
you're<00:03:22.410> gonna<00:03:22.500> want<00:03:22.709> to<00:03:22.739> make<00:03:22.890> sure<00:03:22.950> you<00:03:23.160> push

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 
you're gonna want to make sure you push

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:24.530 
you're gonna want to make sure you push
right<00:03:23.489> on<00:03:23.549> the<00:03:23.670> directional<00:03:23.760> pad<00:03:24.269> again

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 
right on the directional pad again

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:25.550 
right on the directional pad again
because<00:03:24.840> your<00:03:24.959> teammates<00:03:25.140> will<00:03:25.410> naturally

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560 
because your teammates will naturally

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:27.319 
because your teammates will naturally
switch<00:03:26.040> back<00:03:26.220> to<00:03:26.370> defense<00:03:26.670> mode<00:03:26.760> so<00:03:27.060> you<00:03:27.180> want

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:27.329 
switch back to defense mode so you want

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:29.210 
switch back to defense mode so you want
them<00:03:27.420> to<00:03:27.510> go<00:03:27.600> back<00:03:27.750> into<00:03:27.930> focus<00:03:28.320> mode<00:03:28.500> and<00:03:28.769> then

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220 
them to go back into focus mode and then

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:30.530 
them to go back into focus mode and then
after<00:03:29.430> that<00:03:29.549> you're<00:03:29.730> going<00:03:29.850> to<00:03:29.970> lock<00:03:30.120> on<00:03:30.299> with

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:30.540 
after that you're going to lock on with

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:32.900 
after that you're going to lock on with
it<00:03:30.660> with<00:03:30.930> the<00:03:31.019> r-1<00:03:31.350> button<00:03:31.380> and<00:03:31.790> then<00:03:32.790> you're

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:32.910 
it with the r-1 button and then you're

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:34.580 
it with the r-1 button and then you're
gonna<00:03:33.000> focus<00:03:33.239> his<00:03:33.540> legs<00:03:33.810> now<00:03:34.049> it<00:03:34.260> took<00:03:34.380> me<00:03:34.530> a

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:34.590 
gonna focus his legs now it took me a

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:35.660 
gonna focus his legs now it took me a
little<00:03:34.650> while<00:03:34.769> to<00:03:34.950> figure<00:03:35.070> this<00:03:35.280> out<00:03:35.459> you

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:35.670 
little while to figure this out you

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:38.180 
little while to figure this out you
can't<00:03:35.940> just<00:03:36.209> attack<00:03:36.360> a<00:03:36.930> great<00:03:37.739> ape<00:03:37.890> like

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:38.190 
can't just attack a great ape like

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:39.410 
can't just attack a great ape like
normally<00:03:38.579> you<00:03:38.640> can't<00:03:38.850> just<00:03:39.000> shoot<00:03:39.150> him<00:03:39.299> in<00:03:39.390> the

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:39.420 
normally you can't just shoot him in the

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:40.729 
normally you can't just shoot him in the
chest<00:03:39.690> or<00:03:39.810> anything<00:03:39.989> that<00:03:40.140> you<00:03:40.290> actually<00:03:40.470> have

00:03:40.729 --> 00:03:40.739 
chest or anything that you actually have

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:42.940 
chest or anything that you actually have
to<00:03:40.769> pick<00:03:40.980> them<00:03:41.130> apart<00:03:41.190> one<00:03:42.060> thing<00:03:42.299> at<00:03:42.420> a<00:03:42.450> time

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:42.950 
to pick them apart one thing at a time

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:45.590 
to pick them apart one thing at a time
so<00:03:43.950> for<00:03:44.130> me<00:03:44.220> I<00:03:44.250> always<00:03:44.700> focus<00:03:45.120> the<00:03:45.209> legs<00:03:45.420> first

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:45.600 
so for me I always focus the legs first

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:46.699 
so for me I always focus the legs first
because<00:03:45.930> that's<00:03:46.019> what<00:03:46.230> they're<00:03:46.350> walking<00:03:46.620> on

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:46.709 
because that's what they're walking on

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:47.860 
because that's what they're walking on
it<00:03:46.829> seems<00:03:47.040> to<00:03:47.160> help

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:47.870 
it seems to help

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:51.110 
it seems to help
firing<00:03:48.870> Kamehameha<00:03:49.530> waves<00:03:49.940> definitely<00:03:50.940> but

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120 
firing Kamehameha waves definitely but

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:52.550 
firing Kamehameha waves definitely but
basically<00:03:51.480> you<00:03:51.570> just<00:03:51.600> stand<00:03:51.959> back<00:03:52.140> you<00:03:52.320> float

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 
basically you just stand back you float

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:54.170 
basically you just stand back you float
around<00:03:52.680> I'll<00:03:53.040> explain<00:03:53.609> a<00:03:53.670> little<00:03:53.730> bit<00:03:54.000> better

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:54.180 
around I'll explain a little bit better

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:56.210 
around I'll explain a little bit better
once<00:03:54.930> you<00:03:55.019> switch<00:03:55.230> the<00:03:55.410> arms<00:03:55.590> now<00:03:55.859> you<00:03:55.920> can<00:03:56.130> go

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:56.220 
once you switch the arms now you can go

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:58.099 
once you switch the arms now you can go
to<00:03:56.250> any<00:03:56.459> order<00:03:56.760> you<00:03:56.880> want<00:03:57.030> as<00:03:57.299> far<00:03:57.840> as

00:03:58.099 --> 00:03:58.109 
to any order you want as far as

00:03:58.109 --> 00:04:00.410 
to any order you want as far as
ligaments<00:03:58.590> go<00:03:58.680> I<00:03:58.890> always<00:03:58.920> go<00:03:59.400> legs<00:03:59.820> one<00:04:00.209> arm

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:00.420 
ligaments go I always go legs one arm

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:01.880 
ligaments go I always go legs one arm
other<00:04:00.630> arm<00:04:00.900> and<00:04:01.079> then<00:04:01.230> finish<00:04:01.530> off<00:04:01.620> with<00:04:01.680> the

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:01.890 
other arm and then finish off with the

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:03.920 
other arm and then finish off with the
head<00:04:02.070> however<00:04:02.400> it's<00:04:02.579> entirely<00:04:02.910> up<00:04:03.120> to<00:04:03.150> you<00:04:03.390> now

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:03.930 
head however it's entirely up to you now

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:05.900 
head however it's entirely up to you now
as<00:04:04.049> you<00:04:04.140> see<00:04:04.350> I<00:04:04.560> basically<00:04:05.310> just<00:04:05.430> fly<00:04:05.760> around

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:05.910 
as you see I basically just fly around

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:07.490 
as you see I basically just fly around
you<00:04:06.510> definitely<00:04:06.870> want<00:04:07.019> to<00:04:07.049> keep<00:04:07.170> a<00:04:07.290> safe

just<00:04:27.250> pick<00:04:27.520> one<00:04:27.729> limb<00:04:27.970> wait<00:04:28.539> until<00:04:28.750> you<00:04:28.840> get<00:04:28.900> a

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:28.960 
just pick one limb wait until you get a

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:30.450 
just pick one limb wait until you get a
kamehameha<00:04:29.440> wait<00:04:29.620> wait<00:04:29.889> until<00:04:30.129> he<00:04:30.280> does<00:04:30.430> a

kamehameha wait wait until he does a
move<00:04:30.759> that<00:04:30.940> keeps<00:04:31.120> him<00:04:31.270> stationary<00:04:31.810> so<00:04:31.990> he

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:32.110 
move that keeps him stationary so he

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:33.629 
move that keeps him stationary so he
doesn't<00:04:32.349> jump<00:04:32.500> away<00:04:32.740> from<00:04:32.919> X<00:04:33.069> if<00:04:33.250> he<00:04:33.370> does<00:04:33.490> you

00:04:33.629 --> 00:04:33.639 
doesn't jump away from X if he does you

00:04:33.639 --> 00:04:36.960 
doesn't jump away from X if he does you
just<00:04:33.819> waste<00:04:34.000> a<00:04:34.120> Kamehameha<00:04:34.449> wave<00:04:35.759> wait<00:04:36.759> until

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:36.970 
just waste a Kamehameha wave wait until

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:38.670 
just waste a Kamehameha wave wait until
he<00:04:37.060> doesn't<00:04:37.629> move<00:04:37.840> out<00:04:37.990> when<00:04:38.139> he's<00:04:38.229> stationary

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:38.680 
he doesn't move out when he's stationary

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:39.930 
he doesn't move out when he's stationary
and<00:04:38.860> then<00:04:38.949> you<00:04:39.009> use<00:04:39.159> a<00:04:39.190> Kamehameha<00:04:39.639> wave<00:04:39.699> 1

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:39.940 
and then you use a Kamehameha wave 1

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:41.730 
and then you use a Kamehameha wave 1
whatever<00:04:40.090> limb<00:04:40.449> it'll<00:04:41.050> destroy<00:04:41.379> that<00:04:41.560> limb

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:41.740 
whatever limb it'll destroy that limb

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:43.080 
whatever limb it'll destroy that limb
and<00:04:41.979> then<00:04:42.069> you<00:04:42.190> have<00:04:42.340> a<00:04:42.370> brief<00:04:42.669> moment<00:04:43.060> to

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:43.090 
and then you have a brief moment to

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:45.059 
and then you have a brief moment to
attack<00:04:43.240> Vegeta<00:04:43.750> now<00:04:44.020> Vegeta<00:04:44.409> is<00:04:44.500> a<00:04:44.620> great<00:04:44.919> ape

the Kamehameha wave right after that

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:52.800 
the Kamehameha wave right after that
after<00:04:51.340> he<00:04:51.639> broke<00:04:51.849> down<00:04:51.909> from<00:04:52.270> his<00:04:52.419> for<00:04:52.780> me

see Kamehameha wave does cancel out a

00:04:58.180 --> 00:04:59.370 
see Kamehameha wave does cancel out a
mouth<00:04:58.360> beam<00:04:58.630> which<00:04:58.780> I<00:04:58.900> thought<00:04:59.020> was<00:04:59.169> pretty

00:04:59.370 --> 00:04:59.380 
mouth beam which I thought was pretty

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:00.170 
mouth beam which I thought was pretty
sweet

attack him with so instead of attacking
Vegeta<00:05:07.930> I<00:05:08.169> basically<00:05:08.860> hold<00:05:09.069> off<00:05:09.190> and<00:05:09.370> keep

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:09.490

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:12.280 
recommend flying in and beating him up

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:14.219 
recommend flying in and beating him up
but<00:05:12.819> he's<00:05:12.970> not<00:05:13.120> down<00:05:13.389> for<00:05:13.690> more<00:05:13.780> than<00:05:13.840> a<00:05:13.990> split

00:05:14.219 --> 00:05:14.229 
but he's not down for more than a split

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:17.680 
was it he that literally when his arm

00:05:21.089 --> 00:05:21.099 
time you had to attack so it's not even

00:05:21.099 --> 00:05:22.320 
time you had to attack so it's not even
worth<00:05:21.310> flying<00:05:21.639> in<00:05:21.759> there<00:05:21.880> and<00:05:22.000> trying<00:05:22.120> to<00:05:22.210> get
