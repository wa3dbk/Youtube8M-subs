00:00:10.969 --> 00:00:17.460
 I feel this lap and the race is called 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:18.990
 the lol but but because I know since when 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:23.910
 hit a smack to that thing that comes out 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:26.269
 flying but never is but what is 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.269
 happening here 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:38.100
 It's fine because the race is called 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:43.680
 natural disaster or something like that one 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:46.680
 rethink how what is said is a race 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.360
 disaster-free flat but I did not believe 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.940
 that was as disastrous as it is 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:53.399
 being knows apart where everything is full 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.719
 de cohen is with a boy that we 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.730
 let's try to escape not now the one 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:58.649
 but because the vote so much to the seen the 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.120
 bounced that got kid here goes to 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.770
 having nothing has the only thing that has 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.030
 is this guy is going to burst that is what 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:07.489
 only that I understand 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.489
 in this type of racing 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:15.690
 very few checkpoints are missing for 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:18.540
 win the text race of the trees and 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:19.860
 flat and dancing and I think it's that 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.030
 this year sites seems to be the plan 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.130
 it was land spinning at speed 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.450
 fast you know in plan turning by your 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.690
 own axis but in flat to super 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.690
 speed 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:39.179
 on the other hand everybody careful 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:40.800
 4 Look, I said I do not understand 

00:01:39.179 --> 00:01:43.050
 none of this I'm honestly painting 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:45.090
 a little because today second can not be 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:47.720
 It can not be that I will win not me 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.720
 come man 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:55.369
 they beat me and I number that first 

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:57.920
 I do not know how I have traced but the case is 

00:01:55.369 --> 00:01:59.150
 what's left first fans is that we're going 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:01.100
 for a cart a little more normal 

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:03.320
 I believe that with what we have done in 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:04.970
 this we have more than enough things 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:06.920
 rare during today is that no 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:09.200
 sites and exceeded as if everything bounced 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:10.399
 Bramos much madness and folly so 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:11.750
 said no favorites and I think that you 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:13.580
 you have nothing then we go for a cart 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:15.140
 little freaky and now we see you guys 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:16.580
 Once back as you are watching 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:17.780
 carreritas we are a jug of motorcycles to 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:20.000
 like this one that are two tapes issued 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:21.380
 inside the engine and win this because it's going to 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.090
 be a little difficult counting on that 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:24.650
 clear we go here with all subscribers 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:26.120
 and everyone wants to put in very good 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:27.830
 smack a case file to see 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:29.930
 we are here in this race what a said 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:31.400
 motor pile is a race which 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:33.560
 it's called and a very weird man uncle 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:35.450
 being called that by the api bile or 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:36.500
 something yes yes yes as listening that a 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:38.630
 man is very strange they are going to hit me 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:42.680
 you will see if there is going to be 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:44.090
 try to escape rather well here we go 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:46.069
 seconds and vices are very difficult 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:47.989
 staff so I'm going to try to catch 

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:49.370
 the rebound sr vale and put me in first 

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:51.739
 position as soon as possible 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:52.910
 there are 52 control points we have already 11 

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:56.000
 missing 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:58.100
 later I do not realize account number 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.180
 this for nothing nor does it either 

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:01.220
 need to say it you know the people already know 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:02.510
 has realized that not all account 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:03.800
 people have realized that you have not 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:05.930
 realized very nice phrase of salt 

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:08.300
 now it's a counterproductive phrase 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:09.800
 good producing not contradictory 

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:11.660
 one does not care if we go seconds 

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:12.950
 and he does not want the second guy wants what 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:15.080
 first so if it does not go first 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:17.390
 give me a group please give me your slipstream 

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:19.460
 right now if you do not want it removed 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:22.930
 by the bad thank you very much and good 

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:22.930
 people be that good people 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:30.130
 come on second first forgiveness 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:33.200
 eye forward 

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:34.640
 subscribed confirmed very 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:37.550
 of having known because we have a 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:38.540
 mourning lord I quite blunt 

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:40.520
 I'm really not in a hurry to 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:42.890
 Advance the moment 

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:46.180
 He stressed those at the moment because in brief 

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:46.180
 forward moments 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:51.090
 go go 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:56.740
 guys be these data may have 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:04:00.930
 died both me and the already dead instead 

00:03:56.740 --> 00:04:00.930
 of that 

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:06.550
 I'm going to buy the authorship of what I have 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:07.780
 Of course I have it very clear to the boy feet 

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:11.370
 I have the whole motorcycle squad 

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:13.240
 behind are not really far behind you 

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:14.650
 it seems like the got to hit there is if I 

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:17.140
 they catch one hundred for 5,000 thousand who are 

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:18.760
 there are those of air plus they are three 

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:20.019
 guys are three guys what I have already 

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:21.519
 back I saw first therefore my 

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:23.800
 speed greatly reduced is reduced 

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:25.870
 very much and its speed that of those who 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:29.020
 they go back increases a lot because they go 

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:32.020
 back west then let's see if 

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:33.820
 I can keep it today today today today 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:35.590
 is measuring the are watching each 

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:37.690
 time is closer to it is every time 

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:39.730
 we have the pretty ones closer and this 

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:42.250
 it does not give me very good vibes is the truth 

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:44.020
 ok we believe in here let's go there's no 

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:46.750
 the time to lose the boy is august 

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:48.580
 I also have a paste, we have them 

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:53.080
 very very close 

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:54.430
 the party for the party 

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:56.650
 they are also two by two they are watching the 

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:59.889
 slipstream therefore 

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:10.120
 they go faster even than if they were 

00:04:59.889 --> 00:05:12.590
 then it 's something they have in the 

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:14.510
 road when low but good 

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:16.690
 finally it is high next the fence and the 

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:17.979
 8 well worth the eye with the eye tree with the 

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:20.360
 tree 

00:05:17.979 --> 00:05:22.340
 oh my god there we have the clear sample 

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:25.090
 of why we come from the monkey or whatever 

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:27.320
 suddenly playing stops for a tree 

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:30.110
 second miss nothing 

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:32.270
 house and a point of control and study 

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:34.270
 in full position and will win that no 

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:36.610
 for the concrete name 

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:39.490
 my mother and hit a hard hit dude 

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:43.990
 and that boot that comes uncle does not win 

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:45.850

 career first had the race first 

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:50.650
 1 28% the race in first position 

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:52.450
 to be at the last moment third of 

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:54.850
 that is, these outrageous when the 

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:56.950
 Boy, I've already checked out, I've already had 

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:58.120
 proof I have said from the 

00:05:56.950 --> 00:06:00.370
 report has been spoken is lived for you 

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:02.440
 terrorists under the description and leave 

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:03.430
 a comment saying what do you think this 

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:05.050
 last race if a little then there is the 

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:05.950
 true and nothing in return a comment 

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:07.060
 saying what do you think of the first one 

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:08.110
 It has also been good the first that 

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:09.880
 Stripe has already been huge 

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:11.170
 so extraordinarily rare told 

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:13.470
 favorite you even canceled you're nothing 

00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:13.470
 When we go
