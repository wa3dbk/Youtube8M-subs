00:01:48.699 --> 00:01:48.709 
portion of raw can be a problem so I'll

00:01:48.709 --> 00:01:50.230 
portion of raw can be a problem so I'll
record<00:01:48.979> the<00:01:49.100> way<00:01:49.280> given<00:01:49.610> on<00:01:49.700> the<00:01:49.789> packaging

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:50.240 
record the way given on the packaging

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:51.910 
record the way given on the packaging
before<00:01:50.569> I<00:01:50.600> cook<00:01:50.780> the<00:01:50.899> food<00:01:51.080> then<00:01:51.560> after

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:51.920 
before I cook the food then after

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:53.320 
before I cook the food then after
cooking<00:01:52.069> at<00:01:52.280> La<00:01:52.550> the<00:01:52.610> rest<00:01:52.850> will<00:01:53.000> come<00:01:53.119> back<00:01:53.300> to

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:53.330 
cooking at La the rest will come back to

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:54.969 
cooking at La the rest will come back to
room<00:01:53.600> temperature<00:01:53.869> once<00:01:54.679> that<00:01:54.800> room

00:01:54.969 --> 00:01:54.979 
room temperature once that room

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:56.559 
room temperature once that room
temperature<00:01:55.429> are<00:01:55.610> weighing<00:01:55.819> again<00:01:56.209> to<00:01:56.420> get<00:01:56.509> a

00:01:56.559 --> 00:01:56.569 
temperature are weighing again to get a

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:58.300 
temperature are weighing again to get a
ratio<00:01:56.959> between<00:01:57.140> the<00:01:57.289> raw<00:01:57.500> food<00:01:57.830> and<00:01:58.009> the<00:01:58.160> cook

00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:58.310 
ratio between the raw food and the cook

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:59.859 
ratio between the raw food and the cook
food<00:01:58.550> but<00:01:59.060> I'm<00:01:59.179> ready<00:01:59.330> to<00:01:59.420> prepare<00:01:59.720> a<00:01:59.780> meal

00:01:59.859 --> 00:01:59.869 
food but I'm ready to prepare a meal

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:01.630 
food but I'm ready to prepare a meal
I'll<00:02:00.289> take<00:02:00.649> the<00:02:00.770> amount<00:02:01.009> that<00:02:01.069> I<00:02:01.190> want<00:02:01.429> to<00:02:01.490> eat

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:01.640 
I'll take the amount that I want to eat

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:03.999 
I'll take the amount that I want to eat
let's<00:02:02.119> say<00:02:02.360> eight<00:02:02.660> ounces<00:02:03.140> and<00:02:03.319> then<00:02:03.709> divided

00:02:03.999 --> 00:02:04.009 
let's say eight ounces and then divided

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:06.010 
let's say eight ounces and then divided
by<00:02:04.250> the<00:02:04.310> ratio<00:02:04.580> of<00:02:04.880> raw<00:02:05.179> to<00:02:05.240> cooked<00:02:05.479> meat<00:02:05.810> and

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:06.020 
by the ratio of raw to cooked meat and

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:09.930 
by the ratio of raw to cooked meat and
then<00:02:06.470> lay<00:02:06.830> out<00:02:07.009> that<00:02:07.250> amount<00:02:07.849> of<00:02:08.000> cooked<00:02:08.209> food

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:09.940 
then lay out that amount of cooked food

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:12.400 
then lay out that amount of cooked food
and<00:02:10.940> that's<00:02:11.060> pretty<00:02:11.180> much<00:02:11.300> it<00:02:11.390> guys<00:02:11.540> you're

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:12.410 
and that's pretty much it guys you're

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:14.050 
and that's pretty much it guys you're
not<00:02:12.530> trying<00:02:12.680> to<00:02:12.770> get<00:02:12.890> ridiculously<00:02:13.550> lean<00:02:13.819> it's

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:14.060 
not trying to get ridiculously lean it's

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:15.880 
not trying to get ridiculously lean it's
okay<00:02:14.390> to<00:02:14.450> have<00:02:14.599> a<00:02:14.750> fair<00:02:15.140> amount<00:02:15.170> of<00:02:15.410> liens<00:02:15.590> when

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:15.890 
okay to have a fair amount of liens when

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:18.130 
okay to have a fair amount of liens when
it<00:02:15.980> comes<00:02:16.190> to<00:02:16.430> laying<00:02:16.610> out<00:02:16.790> your<00:02:16.819> food<00:02:17.150> but<00:02:17.630> if
