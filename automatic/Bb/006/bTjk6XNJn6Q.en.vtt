about<00:00:19.750> three<00:00:20.260> four<00:00:20.740> years<00:00:20.950> ago<00:00:21.189> I<00:00:21.340> think

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
about three four years ago I think

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.630 
about three four years ago I think
possibly<00:00:22.510> even<00:00:22.840> more<00:00:23.200> than<00:00:23.980> that<00:00:24.160> I<00:00:24.400> can't

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:24.640 
possibly even more than that I can't

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:26.880 
possibly even more than that I can't
actually<00:00:24.790> remember<00:00:25.000> but<00:00:25.690> most<00:00:26.440> what<00:00:26.650> I<00:00:26.680> go

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:26.890

in a bit more so then you can see the

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:17.949 
in a bit more so then you can see the
ends<00:02:11.340> there<00:02:11.989> what<00:02:12.989> different<00:02:15.200> ends<00:02:16.200> on<00:02:16.380> them

00:02:17.949 --> 00:02:17.959 
ends there what different ends on them

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:20.270 
ends there what different ends on them
and<00:02:18.959> if<00:02:19.230> when<00:02:19.500> you<00:02:19.620> make<00:02:19.800> that<00:02:19.980> we're<00:02:20.130> not<00:02:20.220> sure

and if when you make that we're not sure

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:23.060 
and if when you make that we're not sure
what<00:02:20.730> to<00:02:20.850> put<00:02:21.060> on<00:02:21.630> the<00:02:22.110> ends<00:02:22.380> just<00:02:22.590> look<00:02:22.920> on

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:23.070 
what to put on the ends just look on

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:28.009 
what to put on the ends just look on
Google<00:02:23.100> for<00:02:23.700> Images<00:02:24.420> or<00:02:24.750> lockpicks<00:02:26.900> and<00:02:27.900> then

00:02:28.009 --> 00:02:28.019 
Google for Images or lockpicks and then

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:33.500 
Google for Images or lockpicks and then
just<00:02:28.200> copy<00:02:28.350> those<00:02:30.170> so<00:02:31.170> that's<00:02:31.380> the<00:02:31.590> pets<00:02:32.510> then

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
just copy those so that's the pets then

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.840 
just copy those so that's the pets then
you<00:02:33.660> have<00:02:33.750> to<00:02:33.870> have<00:02:33.959> tensioning<00:02:34.560> tool<00:02:34.850> which

you put the touch and turn into the

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:06.890 
you put the touch and turn into the
keyhole<00:03:04.040> at<00:03:05.040> the<00:03:05.160> bottom<00:03:05.519> and<00:03:06.329> twist<00:03:06.690> it

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
keyhole at the bottom and twist it

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:10.729 
keyhole at the bottom and twist it
slightly<00:03:07.940> then<00:03:08.940> you<00:03:09.120> put<00:03:09.480> the<00:03:09.690> picks<00:03:10.140> in<00:03:10.380> and

00:03:13.009 --> 00:03:13.019 
you push the pins up and that is

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:17.479 
you push the pins up and that is
actually<00:03:13.230> how<00:03:13.500> you<00:03:13.609> pick<00:03:14.609> a<00:03:14.640> lock<00:03:16.370> it<00:03:17.370> will

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:17.489 
actually how you pick a lock it will

actually how you pick a lock it will
spin<00:03:19.459> and<00:03:20.459> then<00:03:20.730> paper<00:03:21.390> clips<00:03:21.870> they<00:03:22.019> can<00:03:22.170> be

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
spin and then paper clips they can be

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:25.250 
spin and then paper clips they can be
used<00:03:22.530> for<00:03:22.859> you<00:03:23.850> know<00:03:23.880> as<00:03:24.090> a<00:03:24.180> pick<00:03:24.570> for<00:03:24.840> very

00:04:05.869 --> 00:04:05.879 
what is easier I'm not an expert on a

00:04:05.879 --> 00:04:08.360 
what is easier I'm not an expert on a
lot<00:04:06.690> picture<00:04:07.019> anything<00:04:07.319> like<00:04:07.440> that<00:04:07.470> I<00:04:07.800> don't

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:08.370 
lot picture anything like that I don't

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:10.339

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:14.869 
I think bigger you may have more feeling
in<00:04:13.590> it<00:04:13.680> you<00:04:13.890> know<00:04:14.010> you<00:04:14.159> can<00:04:14.370> feel<00:04:14.519> the<00:04:14.700> pin

00:04:14.869 --> 00:04:14.879 
in it you know you can feel the pin
