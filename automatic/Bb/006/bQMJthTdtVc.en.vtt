00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:05.730
 I went to gravure photography of Investors today 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:07.540
 I am in charge 

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:09.959
 I used it once 

00:00:09.959 --> 00:00:12.219
 In terms of retirement features 

00:00:12.219 --> 00:00:15.219
 It was not full 

00:00:16.409 --> 00:00:18.779
 It was an actual shooting 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:21.489
 High praise 

00:00:21.489 --> 00:00:23.679
 It is said that it is good to be stagnant 

00:00:23.679 --> 00:00:26.079
 until now 

00:00:26.079 --> 00:00:28.890
 It is 2007 but 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.140
 At the very beginning 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:34.670
 Also tall 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:36.880
 Hundreds of people while hitting 

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:37.910
 this year too 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:41.350
 Since then 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:44.640
 Certainly 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.770
 But in 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.780
 I think that it will be helpful for the end but at a glance 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:55.720
 Resumed at the bottom 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:58.720
 No match in the match 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:04.760
 This also happens to wake up in the morning 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:06.550
 catv 

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:10.780
 Professor Shinto Yamanaka of soccer ball size Kyoto University professors 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:13.810
 480 yen 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:15.600
 Make the best use of it 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:16.960
 Second base cent 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:18.710
 Ten 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:20.289
 On the other hand, what should I say 

00:01:20.289 --> 00:01:23.740
 Woods 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:27.070
 It was awful 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:30.070
 It is normal 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:34.800
 Stress comes 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:36.650
 Now 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:38.240
 Because there is no 3 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:41.240
 I am a member of the House of Councilors, but I was born 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.920
 Eliminated at 0-1 and retired 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:50.920
 I have to discuss it 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.680
 28th is 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.930
 It is a player of the same generation of the year before this 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:01.960
 During that 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:03.440
 I think I can breathe 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:04.880
 And I 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:06.550
 I decided in the sand 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:08.959
 I think I want a taro 

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:12.229
 Please come to me 

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:13.889
 I still achieved it now
