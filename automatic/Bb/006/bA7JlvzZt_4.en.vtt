00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.269
 yes 

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:10.299
 and rather I cut the trajectory of 

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:14.570
 ball 

00:00:10.299 --> 00:00:19.120
 a little volley and well I will not say 

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:19.120
 that yuri has pulled more of the cornea but 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:24.560
 because it's not true he has got it right 

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:26.740
 but a little bit lower 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:30.109
 and he recovered it 

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:32.000
 ve not said anything to you in particular not 

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:35.059
 he did not speak to everyone or at least 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.860
 to me about the corner kicks is a 

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:39.500
 special feeling for you to make a goal 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:40.910
 of good head given that I do not get 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:43.250
 often it's fine 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:45.769
 that shows that I 'm not that nil when 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:48.170
 managed to mark in your opinion who are 

00:00:45.769 --> 00:00:50.449
 the very best finishers head 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:54.470
 good players with heads like this 

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:56.449
 zamorano that they called the helicopter 

00:00:54.470 --> 00:01:00.339
 yes because it seemed to take off at each 

00:00:56.449 --> 00:01:00.339
 time a little 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:05.269
 and another thing that does not have anybody 'is 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:07.520
 that gives you the impression that it stays 

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:09.290
 in the air you know what I tell you 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:11.590
 that has as a double impulse and that 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:11.590
 they go up 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:17.500
 esther castaÃ±eda can be sent capital 

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:20.039
 front that says the center we do the 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:20.039
 same healthy 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.040
 finish 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:44.930
 I'm looking at the coverage and look 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.930
 all clinic 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:54.900
 imposing remarkable exterior when it jumps 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:57.620
 as they give the gravity center 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:57.620
 chestnut 

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:01.210
 paraguay 

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:08.900
 for marcelo 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:08.900
 and the interurban and in this second goal
