00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:13.889
 the tension may come with the 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.360
 first difficulties of the weekend in 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:16.560
 waiting for vincenzo nibali had the 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.939
 smile at the moment of the contrails 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.390
 yellow jersey for a fifth day 

00:00:17.939 --> 00:00:20.609
 straight 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.050
 waiting for the vosges so the second 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:23.490
 the longest stage of this tour between 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.529
 epernay and nancy posed no problem 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.179
 to the messina shark stay well at 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:27.929
 hot in the front of the pack surrounded by 

00:00:27.179 --> 00:00:30.420
 his teammates 

00:00:27.929 --> 00:00:31.740
 an astana team that had the happiness of 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.660
 find an ally of circumstance 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.070
 after forming a breakaway of six 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.960
 runners at the start of the stage the runners 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.760
 cannondale were instructed to do 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.410
 the tempo and hunt to favor 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.480
 the designs of their leader peter sagan 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.700
 favorites given the topography of the 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.230
 final badly took them but it's not 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.670
 bali did not get there in the same 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.740
 time that trent he the champion of italy 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.120
 keeps his yellow jersey and could 

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:53.240
 congratulate on the victory of his 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.240
 compatriot 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.420
 it was still a very long stage it 

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:02.700
 heightened the tension within the pack 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.960
 in addition the wind blows and so all 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:06.110
 the big teams feels focused on 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.110
 front 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:10.800
 this creates unnecessary stress at the end of 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.000
 race it was necessary to remain his ranks because 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:14.280
 everyone again everyone 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.660
 wanted to take the places up front the 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.660
 danger was therefore present in this final 

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:25.380
 I saw the victory of matteo trencin at 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.850
 the photo finish is very tight I am 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.530
 disappointed to petter because he's my friend 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.990
 but it's good for mateo because 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.070
 he is a very professional runner 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:33.480
 victories like these are very 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.550
 important for us for cycling 

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:37.830
 Italian weekend will be very 

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:38.360
 difficult for sure we will see 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:40.350
 attacks 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:41.550
 today we have already seen contador 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.220
 forward in the last ascent 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:45.300
 he was in the rock wheel but he 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.040
 there was no yves france at the end of 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:49.190
 account anyway I feel good on 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.190
 will 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:56.200
 then moribund
